IF 



B esides bein^ the title of this 
magazine, If is of course a 
poem by Rudyard Kipling which 
goes in part: 

If you can keep your head when 
all about you 

Are Wsing theirs ^ and blaming it 
on you .... 

Kipling did well with the poem; 
next to Gunga Din and The Road 
to Mandalay it is about the most 
successful piece of writing he ever 
did. The poem If is a passionate 
plea for calm. Keep your head, it 
says. Don't panic. Don't despair. 
Keep plowing right ahead . and 
then you'll be a man, my son. 

This is no doubt good advice — 
in certain circumstances. In others, 
maybe not so good. It is the kind of 
advice that is handed out freely by 
people in high places, in all coun- 
tries, who aren't really themselves 
too sure what the future is going to 
produce but don't want their elec- 
torate to get upset. Does the north- 
east part of the United States go 
through a total power failure? 
Never fear, they say, it can't hap- 
pen again. Are we clearly headed 
for a population pressure that not 
all our^ tractors and fertilizers can 
feed? Not to worry; we'll find a 
way, say they. 

Of course, human history argues 
powerfully on the side of the 
Princes of Serendip who soothe us 
with these words. The human race 



has in fact muddled through a great 
many challenges over the past half- 
million years. World War Two pro- 
vides some illuminating examples. 
Be calm, said Neville Chamberlain, 
we have Peace in Our Time, while 
Winston Churchill flapped and 
shouted in the background — ^but it 
was Churchill, not Chamberlain, 
who had to pick up the pieces when 
the whole facade of calm fell apart 
under Hitler's attack. 

Today the issues are not the same, 
but the words are. We will find a 
way; the Free World will muddle 
through. (On the other side of the 
fence the words go: “History is on 
our side; we of the People's Repub- 
lics will outlive our enemies.") But 
is there really any firm ground for 
believing that this is so? 

Or have we in fact reached a 
point in human history where mud- 
dling through, with its penalties of 
shock, disruption, cataclysm and de- 
struction, is simply a luxury we can 
no longer afford? 

We who are turned on to science 
fiction — who like to look at the fu- 
ture; who try to see beyond tomor- 
row's TV programs — perhaps would 
rewrite some of the sage advice 
Kipling offered about keeping our 
heads. Maybe calm is not the best 
response to the challenges of today. 
Maybe we should adopt the altered 
version of Kipling's poem that was 
current in the armed forces a few 
years ago, which runs like this: 

If you can keep your head when 
all about you 

Are losing theirs . 

Then, fella, maybe you just don't 
have a very good grasp of what the 
situation is all about!

THE 

LONG WAY 
TO EARTH 

by JOHN BRUNNER 

Illustrated by ADKINS 



The job called for very simple 
skills. You had fo be willing 
to be the only human being oa 
the planet — and fo die there! 



It wasn’t the first time in her life 
she’d been the odd one out, so that 
figured. For example — and the 
most glaring example — she hadn’t 
had to leave Earth. 

That marked her off immediately 
even on a comparativety highly pop- 
ulated outerwodd hke Nefertiti. The 
massive **encouraged emlgratioin” of 



I 

T here was one item on display 
in the enormous window: a 
zygra pelt. Kynance Foy stood and 
looked at k. There were a lot of 
other women doing the same thing. 

But she was the only one who was 
gritting her teeth.

the Diotatrix period had lowered 
the premiums on wanderlust at home. 
It was a full generation since Nefer- 
titi declared itself independent and 
set quotas for Earthside immigrants, 
and then found them superfluous 
because the demand wasn’t there. 

For the umpteenth time Ky nance 
read the discreet hand-lettered price 
tag attached to one corner of the 
stand on which the zygra pelt was 
draped. It read: One million credits. 
No other price had ever been asked 
for the pelts. 

Okay, Ky nance told herself sour- 
ly. I was naive, , , . 

She had never confessed it even 
to her closest friends, but one of the 
things she had planned to bring back 
wihen she returned to astonish those 
who had mocked her was — a zygra 
pelt. She had pictured herself 
emerging from the exit of the star- 
ship wearing it: not elegantly, but 
casually, tossed around her, her 
body molded by it into insurpass- 
able perfection, yet her pose im- 
plying that she had had it so long 
she was becoming faintly bored with 
the attention she attracted. 

At this moment she did not even 
possess the price of a square meal. 

Other plans, other ambitions, had 
been shed one by one as she dog- 
gedly worked her way towards Nef- 
ertiti, reasoning that the closer one 
came to the source the cheaper the 
pelt might become. Not so. Only 
the cost of interstellar freight shrank, 
while the asking price remained 
steady at one million. 

She stood watching its shifts of 
sheen and texture, wondering what 
exotic perfumes it had been trained 
to secrete. What, for instance. 



matched that liquid rainbow phase 
when the pelt seemed to run in 
endless streams of pure color? She 
cursed her own stupidity. 

Yet. 

Was I to know? 

Oh, maybe. Her brash confidence, 
though, hadn’t lacked evidence to 
support it. 

She was fresh out of college with 
a brilliant record. She had deliberate- 
ly changed her major to qua-space 
physics and her minor to interstellar 
commerce when she made her mind 
up, but before that she ‘had been 
well grounded in the unfeminine 
combination of business law and 
practical engineering — the latter by 
accident, merely to get her own 
back on a sneering boy friend who 
once offered to fix her skycar. 

This, moreover, was not her only 
equipment. She was exactly one 
meter seventy tall; she was exotical- 
ly gorgeous, having inherited dark 
eyes and sinuous grace from a 
Dutch ancestor who fell from grace 
in Java in company of a temple 
dancer, and hair of a curious iron- 
gray shade traceable only to a colony 
of Cornish tin-miners totalling some 
five hundred persons in a multi- 
billion galactic population, against 
which her tanned skin burned like 
new copper. 

There was no risk — so she had 
argued — of her ever being strand- 
ed. If the worst came to the worst, 
and neither qua-space physics nor 
her encyclopedic knowledge of in- 
terstellar commerce could secure 
her employment, she could al- 
ways .... 

Well, she had never phrased the 
idea clearly to herself, but k in-

THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 




solved some romantically handsome 
jfoung starship officer willing to 
hazard his career for the sake of her 
company on a trip to some more 
promising planet, a crochety cap- 
tain won over by her dazzling per- 
sonality and delivery with unsoli- 
cited testimonials to an entrepeneur 
in need of a private secretary when 
they arrived. 

S he had begun to suspect she had 
made the wrong decision on the 
first stop out from Earth, when 
^e still had the cash in hand to 
go home. 

What she had overlooked was 
that during the miserable regime of 
the Dictatrix incredible numbers of 
non-pioneer types had been — in the 
official terminology of the day — 
“encouraged” to emigrate, chief 
among them intractable intellectuals 
doubtful of the universal benefits 
Her Magnificence was supposed to 
be bestowing. Consequently the out- 
worlds had been colonized, forcibly, 
by a swarm of brilliant and very 
angry men and women. Having noth- 
ing left but the desire to get even, 
they had buckled to and made the 
best of what they had. 

Not for this breed of colonist was 
the broad axe or the draft-ox or the 
log-cabin. They were used to lasers, 
vidding and mufable furniture. They 
knew the necessary techniques; and 
with the determination of fanatics 
they had set out not merely to pro- 
vide such luxuries for themselves 
but to insure that if the same fate 
overtook their children or their chil- 
dren’s children the youngsters would 
be able to repeat the process. 



Which was not to imply that 
there were absolutely no openings on 
such old-settled words as Ge and 
New Medina for moderately talent- 
ed young women. Had this been the 
case she would have turned around 
despite the scorn she would face 
from her friends on retreating to 
Earth. Instead, she found tempor- 
ary work; saved up; moved on, con- 
vincing herself that things would be 
different further out. 

They were. 

By her third or fourth stopover, 
she was encountering sea-^harvesters 
supervised by ten-year-olds, each re- 
sponsible for two thousand tons of 
protein-rich food a week and a 
mainstay of the planetary economy, 
and reading bulletin boards at space- 
ports bearing blanket warnings — 
to save the labor of writing the 
words on every single advertisement 
— that no one lacking a Scholar 
degree in the relevant subjects need 
bother to apply. 

And even her asset of last resort, 
her appearance, failed her. What she 
had failed to reckon with — or 
omitted to find out — was that 
once they were clear of Earth, and 
the traditional association of ap- 
pearance with regional origins, the 
emigrants whether forced or vol- 
untary were satisfied to be human 
beings rather than Europeans or 
Africans or Asians. By the time a 
couple of generations had slipped 
away, the mixing of the gene-pool 
was already throwing up types 
which made the concept “exotic’* 
seem irrelevant. Swedisih and Que- 
chua. Chukchi and Matabele, the 
wildest extremes of physique met

IF 




in a mad succession of paradoxes. 
And the outcrossing, in good genetic 
fashion, produced its quota of fan- 
tasy. Tlien, released from Earthside 
attachment to local types, the more 
prosperous girls started to experi- 
ment, drawing on some of the fin- 
est talents in biology and surgery. 
Within ten yards of where Kynance 
was standing, there were a Negress 
with silver hair and blood-red 
irises, a miniaturized Celtic redhead 
no higher than her elbow and 
stacked and a shimmering golden 
girl with slanted eyes and the quiet 
hypnotic movements of a trained 
geisha. Any of the three would 
have monopolized a roomful of 
sophisticated Earthmen. 

On Druid, somebody had asked 
Kynance to marry him. On Quetzal 
someone else had asked her to act 
as hostess for him and be his 
acknowledged mistress. On Loki a 
third man had suggested, rather 
bored'ly, that she become his son’s 
rhistress, the son being aged sixteen 
and due to submit his scholar’s thesis 
in cybernetics. 

And on Nefertiti she would have 
been grateful for even that much 
attention. 

Confronted with the symbol of 
her »empty ambitions, she admitted 
the truth to herself at last. She 
was scared. 

Well, gawping at the zygra pelt 
wasn’t solving the problem of hun- 
ger. She made to move away. 

At that moment, a soft voice em- 
anated from the air. It came over 
a biaxial interference speaker, so 
for practical purposes the statement 
was exact. She stopped dead. 



“The Zygra Company draws your 
attention to a vacancy occurring 
shortly on its staff. Limited service 
contract, generous remuneration, 
comfortable working conditioiis, 
previous experience not necessary, 
standard repatriation clause. Apply 
at this office, inquiring for Execu- 
tive Shuster.’’ 

The message was repeated twice. 
Kynartce stood In a daze, waiting 
for the rusih to begin. There was no 
rush. The only reaction was the 
sound of an occasional sarcastic 
laugh as people who had been gaz- 
ing at the pelt were disturbed and 
decided to wander on. 

No. Ridiculous. Im'possible. She 
must have dreamed it. Not enough 
food and too much worry had con- 
spired to create an illusion. 

Nonetheless she was on her way 
to the entrance of the Zygra Build- 
ing. She hadn’t taken a conscious 
decision — she was following a tro- 
pism as automatic as that of a 
thirsty man spotting an oasis across 
the desert. 

She did wonder why one or two 
people sihe jostled looked pityingjy 
at her eagerness, but that was af- 
terwards. 

U 

E xecutive Shuster wias a vain man 
of early middle age. It was 
obvious he was vain. His expensive 
clothes were meant to look expen- 
sive. His fastidiously arranged office 
was a frame for him. And his man- 
ner as he looked her over implied 
that he hoped she would instantly 
fall on her knees. 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



f 




Kynance did no;hing of the sort. 
Right now she had room in her 
head for precisely one thought, and 
she uttered it. 

“You’re offering a job. What is 
it?’’ 

Shuster looked her over a second 
time, shrugged and put on a prac- 
ticed artificial smile. “I must say 
that it’s seldom I have the pleasure 
of interviewing such an attractive 
candidate for one of our posts.” 

“What’s the job?” 

Shuster blinked. He retreated to 
Position Two: superior knowledge- 
ability. “I can tell by your accent 
you're not Nefertitian. Do sit down, 
won’t you? And would you care for 
a drink?” 

Kynance stayed put. Not that she 
cared what the job was. She’d have 
accepted the chance to be junior 
wasiher-up on an interstellar tramp, 
providing the contract carried the 
standard repatriation clause. 

That was the bait which had 
brought her into this room — not the 
propect of getting on the inside of 
The Zygra Company itself. She would 
have traded every pelt in the galaxy 
for a berth on a ship bound for 
borne. 

The repatriation clause was one of 
»he few attempts made by Earth’s 
current government to impose a de- 
cree on the unnriy outworlds, and 
the only attempt to have succeeded. 
Following the Dictatrix period, 
everyone in the galaxy was shy of 
absolute decrees. But there was 
enough mobility among the out- 
worlds themselves to generate sup- 
port for the concept of compulsory 
repatriation, so even the greediest 



entrepeneurs had had to succumb 
and write in the clause. 

It stated simply that if the place 
of work was on another planet than 
the world where the labor was en- 
gaged, compliance with the condi- 
tions of employment entitled the 
employee to repatriation at the ex- 
pense of the company . whether 
or not the planet of origin was the 
one where the worker had been 
hired. 

Prior to this, some of ,the less 
scrupulous companies had forcibly 
colonized outworlds by methods 
even less polite than the Dictatrix’s: 
luring workers into their net with 
temptingly high salaries, then aban- 
doning them light-years from any 
place where they could spend their 
earnings. 

To Kynance, this was salvation — 
if she got the job. 

“I would not care for a drink,” 
she said. “All I want is a plain 
answer.” 

Shuster retreated to Position 
Umpteen, sighed and gestured at his 
desketary. “The contract is a very 
long and detailed one.” he mur- 
mured with a last attempt at regain- 
ing lost ground. “I do think you 
should sit down while we discuss 
it.” 

W ith the mobile bulk of the desk- 
etary to help him, he outnum- 
bered Kynance. She was forced to 
accept a seat on a two-th in-person 
lounge along the window wall, where 
Shuster joined her. He then man- 
euvered the desketary so that she 
couldn’t run away across the room, 
and rubbed his shoulder against hers. 



10 



IF 




When he gets to the knee-maul- 
ing stage, Kynaoce promised herself, 
ril — ril think about it. 

She was that desperate, and hadn’t 
realized it before. 

“The post,” Shuster was saying 
urbanely, “isn’t such a demanding 
one, really. It’s a shame, in fact, 
that so lovely a girl — ” 

“Executive, unless you’re stupid 
you’ve already caught on to what 
interests me about the job,” Kynaoce 
snapped. 

“The repatriation clause? Oh, it’s 
there, in full.” Shuster smiled and 
moved a little closer. “Though 
strictly in confidence — ” 

“If you don’t give girls straight 
answers,” Ky nance purred with 
malice, “don’t you expect them to 
misunderstand you?” 

The trap worked fine. Shuster 
diminished the pressure of his 
shoulder against hers by at least 
ten per cent and spoke in a voice as 
mechanical as a desketary’s. 

“Supervisor of Zygra for a term 
of one year at a salary of a hundred 
thousand credits.” 

Supervisor of Zygra — ? 

There was a long silence. At last 
Kynance said in a thin voice. “You 
can’t possibly mean the planet 
Zygra? You must mean a farm, or 
a plantation, or — or something!” 
Shuster curled his lips into a 
pleased grin. “Of course, coming as 
you do from Ge, you wouldn’t know 
much about zygra pelt production, 
would you?” 

“Your announcement said no ex- 
perience was necessary. And I’m 
from Earth, not Ge.” 

She bit her tongue, fractionally 



too late, seeing in imagination her 
chance of the post vanishing into 
vacuum. With repatriation involved, 
logically the Zygra Company would 
prefer to hire someone from Nefer- 
titi, where it had its registered HQ, 
or from some nearer world than 
Barth at least — some worlds coQr 
venient for its own ships. For tlM 
sake of a gibe at this horrible stran- 
ger she had sacrificed . 

But what was he saying? 

Unperturbed, Shuster was con- 
tinuing in the same tone. “But you 
must have spent some time on Ge, 
at least? I could have sworn I de- 
tected it in your accent. Well, let’s 
set the record straight, shall we? 
Central Computing, please,” he 
added to the desketary. “Category 
application for employment, sub- 
category supervisor of Zygra, candi- 
date Foy, Kynance, new reference 
number.” 

He sat back, contriving to restore 
the pressure on her. “By the way, 
I did mean supervisor of the planet 
Zygra,” he concluded, and enjoyed 
the smashing impact of the words. 

That at leastt, Kynance decided 
bitterly, settled the matter. For the 
task of supervising the unique, 
jealously guarded home of the pelts, 
they would never pick — 

Hang on, though! Why was the 
job described in these terms any- 
way? The demand for pelts implied a 
massive installation at the point of 
origin — a staff of hundreds, more 
likely thousands — breeding, train- 
ing, a million-and-one subsidiary 
tasks. 

She frowned and rubbed her fore- 
head in a frantic attempt to remem- 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH

her what little she had ever known 
about the production of zygra pelts. 
Something about the planet being 
unfit for colonization . ? 

“How are the things raised?” she 
asked, surrendering. 

S huster leaned confidentially close. 

“Tlhe term ‘pelt’ is a misnomer. 
It’s no breach of company secrecy 
to say so nowadays, although when 
they were first being imported to 
civilized worlds the admission would 
have been an automatic breach of 
an employee’s contract, since it was 
thought advisable to mislead pur- 
diasers and possible rivals by mak- 
ing them think it was the skin of an 
animal. In fact, the pelts are entire 
lifeforms in themselves. Insofar as 
they’re related to anything we know 
they’re a kind of moss. So I sup- 
pose ‘plantation’ is as good a term 
as any for the place where they 
grow!” He laughed and }abbed her 
in the ribs. 

“Though it’s impossible to grow 
anything else there, I tell you 
frankly. Zygra is a sort of — now, 
how shall I describe it?” 

“You’ve been there yourself?” 
Ky nance suggested, trying to wrig- 
gle away and finding her progress 
firmly blocked by the end of the 
narrow lounge. 

“Naturally I’ve been there,” 
Shuster said loftily. “In actual fact, 
the supervisor of Zygra is responsi- 
ble to me, so one of the duties which 
I undertake is ensuring that the 
terms of the contract are strictly 
adhered to. Of course this involves 
direct inspection and . .” 



He ran on at some length, to make 
sure she didn’t miss the point. In 
essence, he was saying: it pays to 
be nice to me, 

“You were telling me about Zy- 
gra,” she murmured finally. 

“Oh yes! A sort of vegetable stew 
is as near as one can come to 
describing it, I think. Marshland, a 
few patches of open water, much 
smaller than oceans on planets which 
have satellites, and — plants. I be- 
lieve the parasitism extends to the 
fourteenth degree. In other words, 
there are some highly evolved forms, 
including the pelts, which can’t ab- 
sorb nutriment until it’s been pro- 
cessed by an ecological chain four- 
teen units long. They remain plants 
rather than animals, you under- 
stand.” 

Dim facts were beginning to seep 
from Ky nance’s memory — not 
dim merely because she had never 
studied the subject seriously, but 
also because as a matter of policy 
the Zygra Company shroud^ its 
operations in mystery. Not even the 
Dictatrix had dared to monkey with 
so powerful and wealthy an organi- 
zation. 

Come to think of it, it was a 
wonder that they’d agreed to re- 
patriation clauses. They, and they 
alone, might have managed to stand 
out against the general trend. 

A little faintly, she said, ’’Look, 
I’m sorry if I’m being silly, but the 
impression I get is that this job in- 
volves being the only person on Zy- 
gra.” 

“That is correct.” He eyed her 
calculatingly. “So, if you wish to re- 
consider the application I’ll find it

IF 




perfectly understandable. To be 
alone on a strange planet is bad 
enough when there are millions of 
people there already, as I’m sure 
you’ve found out. So why don’t I 
take you around a bit and introduce 
you to some of my friends, get you 
over the worst of it? Believe me, I 
know how difficult it is to — ” 
“Repatriation clause,” Kynance 
muttered between clenched teeth, 
too faintly for Shuster to hear her. 
He Was edging even closer now, a 
feat she would have thought im- 
possible. 

“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear that?” 
You weren't meant to. Aloud and 
with a flashing smile, Kynance said, 
“Then how is the — plantation 
run?” 

“Automated,” Shuster sighed. 
“The most complete and elaborate 
system of automation, and I may 
add the most thoroughly defended 
against interference, in the entire 
galaxy. The supervisor’s post is a 
sinecure.” 

S he turned it over in her mind. 

A sinecure for which the all- 
powerful Zygra Company pays this 
vast salary? There must be a catch, 
but Tm damned if / can see what — 
Oh, this matter of being the only 
person on the planet! 

“Let me get this quite right,” she 
said. “The supervisor is alone on the 
planet?” 

“The supervisor of Zygra,” Shus- 
ter said patiently, “is the only em- 
ployee of the Zygra Company whose 
place of employment is on Zygra 
itself.” 

“Claim-jumping,” Kynance said. 



“What?” 

“Claim-jumping! Automated 
equipment in operalioa doesn’t con- 
stitute possession of an astral body: 
Government and People of the Unit- 
ed States versus Government and 
People of the Soviet Union, Inter- 
national Court of Justice, 1971. You 
have to maintain at least the. fiction 
of human habitation, or anybody 
else could step in an4 occupy Zyg- 
ra.” 

Shuster, she was delighted to see, 
blanched. He said, “You — you’ve 
studied law?” 

“Of course.” 

“Well, then . Shuster rubbed 
his chin and withdrew a few milli- 
meters. 

You look as if you've forgotten 
something, buster. And you have. 
You should have exploited this per- 
fect opportunity to find out all about 
me. 

Absolutely correct. Shuster’s next 
step was to reach for the controls 
of the desketary. 

“There is the slight additional 
point to consider, isn’t there?” he 
muttered. “I mean, not only wheth- 
er the job suits you, but whether 
you suit the job. Uh — Central Com- 
puting!” 

“Waiting,” said the desketary 
rather sullenly. 

“Applicant Foy, Kynance. Per- 
sonal and career details follow.” 

“I am twenty-five years old,” 
Kynance began clearly, and went 
ahead from there, visualizing a stan- 
dard application form in her mind’s 
eye. Halfway through her college 
courses the idea struck her that 
Shuster was getting nervous; she

went on with as much detail as she 
could muster, hoping she was on the 
right track, and found she was when 
the desketary finally started to ring 
an interruption bell. 

“Further information superflu- 
ous,” the mechanical voice grunted. 

“Shut up!” Shuster rapped, but 
the machine finished what it had to 
say anyhow. 

“Applicant’s qualifications greatly 
in excess of stipulated minimum!” 

There must he a catch in it. Must 
be, must be! Maybe it*s in the con-' 
tract itself. 

It was Shuster’s turn to detect 
worry. He recovered fast from his 
annoyance at what the desketary 
had revealed — or rather, the com- 
pany’s economically-minded comput- 
ers, determined not to waste time on 
questions to which the answer was 
known. 

“That’s fine, then, isn’t it?” he 
said. “So — but I see you’re not 
happy.” 

“Show me the contract, please,” 
Kynance said, and waited for the 
desketary to issue a copy of it. 

S omewhat to her surprise, it was 
by no means the most weasely 
she had seen. It was long, but it 
was explicit. All but a handful of 
its clauses were patterned on a hope- 
ful standard form laid down by 
Earth’s government in the aftermath 
of the Dictatrix period, and conse- 
quently weighted heavily against ar- 
bitrary conditions. 

So the trap is in the non-standard 
clauses. 

Her instinct in similar situations 
before had been to get an independ- 



ent evaluation, preferably from a 
computer programmed by a reform- 
ed confidence trickster with a deep 
knowledge of human deceit. Now, 
lacking even the price of a meal, she 
had to rely on her own judgment 

I wish my eyes wouldn't keep 
drifting back to the repatriation hit! 

She said, without looking up, 
“When does the contract come into 
force?” 

“On signature,” Shuster said. His 
tone suggested he was enjoying a 
private and rather cruel joke. “The 
commencement of actual work is 
according to the schedule you’ve 
read, and the basic term is one Nef- 
ertitian year. Option to renew must 
be signified in advance but not less 
than one month before due date of 
repatriation.” 

She pounced. “In other words, I 
start work less than one month from 
now?” 

“Ah — not exactly.” But Shuster 
didn’t seem put out. “The previous 
incumbent is due to leave in two 
months’ time, but you understand we 
must insure ourselves against the 
contingency you’ve already men- 
tioned: the risk of leaving Zygra 
without a legal occupant acting for 
the company. Also there is a short 
period of training, environmental 
familiarization and so forth. Custo- 
marily we advertise ahead of the due 
date.” 

“But I become an employee di- 
rectly I validate the contract?” 

“If I were in your place I shouldn’t 
jump at it,” Shuster said insinuating- 
ly. “Why don’t you consider — ?” 

None of his alternative proposals 
was apt to contain a repatriation

daruse. Kynance shuddered as im- 
perceptibly as possible and went on 
examining the form. 

One wouldn’t expect the Zygra 
Company to be tender-hearted, but 
even so the schedule was stark. In 
this sector most stars were margi- 
nally hotter than Sol, so habitable 
planets orbited a little farther out. 
Like Nefertiti, Zygra had a year 
longer than Earth’s. Once in the 
course of that year the company 
landed a ship, staying about a week 
at the time when the harvest was 
ripe. (That was awe-inspiring, in a 
way. One ship per year, and its 
cargo paid for everything several 
times over!) The “incumbent”, to 
borrow Shuster’s term, was delivered 
on one visit, fetched away the next. 
If he was injured or fell sick, the 
policy was straightforward and in- 
deed spelt out: he or she was kept 
alive by prosthetic devices so that 
when the next ship landed continuity 
in the legal sense was established. 
After that it was presumably a mat- 
ter of chance whether you died on 
the way home. The company 
wouldn’t be bothered. 

Might sue for your injuries . .7 
No, forbidden as an ex post facto 
breach of contract. Arguable, might 
not stand, in a court, but a helpless 
cripple up against the Zygra Com- 
pany would be ill advised to find 
out. Of course, some rival firm 
might finance a claim, but to what 
purpose? They’d settle with the of- 
fer of an undernourished surplus-to- 
requirement pelt, and the owner 
would become instantly rich. 

Stick to the point, woman! Ky- 
nance adjured herself. 



There were a good many ways to 
break the contract and render k 
void, but try as she might she 
couldn’t imagine herself throwing 
away the chance of repatriation for 
any of the conceivable reasons. And 
as for the inconceivable ones, it must 
purely be legal excess of caution that 
put them in. For example, this non- 
standard clause mortared into the 
middle of half a dozen stock items: 
“It shall be absolute and agreed 
grounds to void this contract if the 
signatory B — ” the employee — 
“shall at any time during his/her 
term of employment herein specified 
reveal, divulge, indicate or in any 
fashion whatsoever communicate to 
a person not an employee of the 
signatory A — ” the Zygra Company 
— “any information relevant to the 
production, training, conditioning or 
other process of manufacture of the 
product known as Zygra pells; or 
shall signal or shall attempt to signal 
or in any way establish communica- 
tion from the place of employment 
to or with any person not an em- 
ployee of the signatory A on any 
subject whatsoever whether or not 
specified above.” 

The place of employment was de- 
fined as “the surface of the planet 
Zygra or any place or places what- 
soever in the absolute discretion of 
the signatory A defined as a place 
or places where the business of the 
signatory A is carried on.” 

W as that the hole? Did it imply 
that the contract was void k, 
prior to the year’s end, she told a 
spacelines booking clerk she had 
been working on Zygra? 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH

It might, but even a year’s isola- 
tion wasn’t going to lower her deter- 
mination to go home! She could 
keep her mouth shut as long as she 
had to, and not even the Zygra 
Company could compel her to stay 
quiet once the year was over. 

A final time she leafed through 
the contract; then she reached out 
abruptly and moistened her thumb 
on the desketary’s validation pad. 
Her hand poised over the form. And 
still she hesitated. 

“How many other applicants have 
there been for this post?” she said 
abruptly. 

Shuster had forgotten to cancel 
his circuit to the firm’s computers; 
blindly the voice rang out. 

“No other candidate has — ” 

“Shut up!” Shuster roared, and 
this time he was quick enough to 
activate the cancelling mechanisms. 
Kymance looked at him and said 
nothing. 

“Ah . .” He ran his finger around 
the collar of his tunic. “I could tell 
something was bothering you, and 
I’m not surprised. Of course, there’s 
the point that we’ve only just begun 
to advertise the post — ” 

Kynance tapp^ the form stonily. 
According to the schedule incorpor- 
ated in it, the harvesting ship was 
due to call in less than seven weeks. 

“Moreover, even at the salary we 
offer, there are few people who are 
willing to’ accept a year’s absolute 
isolation.” Shuster was recovering 
again — ^he bounced back fast and al- 
ways to the same orbit. Now he was 
sliding his arm behind her, fingers 
groping for the bare skin under her 
nape-hair. 



“But in strict and total confidenot 
there is someithing which hddi 
people back from applying, even 
people like yourself who are lonely 
on Nefertiti and have few friendi 
. .” The fingers slithered down her 
shoulder; the other hand fumbled 
around her waist and upwards. Ky- 
naince waited, frozen. 

“If you take my advice,” Shuster 
whispered, “I think you’ll find it 
pays in the long run, and k’s much 
more fun than sitting for a year 
watching machines look after a lot 
of moss — beautiful moss, but just 
moss in the last analysis. Look, be- 
fore you validate the contract shall 
we—?” 

/ know what the reason is why 
people don*t apply in droves. The 
word's got around that they have 
to get past you. 

Kynance made four precisely 
timed movements. The first slid out 
from the grip on her shoulder; the 
second detached the hand trespassing 
on her bosom; the third stabbed her 
thumb hard on the validation box of 
the contract; and the fourth slapped 
Shuster resoundingly on the cheek. 

For long seconds he didn’t react. 
Then, the mark burning redly on 
his pale skin, he took the contract 
and entered the firm’s validation 
also, making the gesture a complete 
vocabulary of abuse. 

Finally he spoke between clenched 
teeth: 

“And 1 hope you rot."

days would pass befome she foimd 
herself wisbmg for another sight of 
SbusitcT, she would have thought the 
speaker crazy. Yet that was how it 
turned out. 

There was something absolutely 
terrifying for an Eanthsider in the 
impersonal, almosit machine-like way 
the Zygra Company accepted its 
new employee. Of course, outworld- 
ere were accustomed to this method 
of treatment. People whose family 
tradition embraced the concept of 
taming a whole planet with less than 
a thousand responsible adults, or 
homesteading half a continent with 
servos jury-rigged out of spaceship 
scrap, would probably prefer emo- 
tionless mechanical supervision to 
the unpredictability of human be- 
ings. 

Kynance’s previous jobs since 
leaving Earth, though, had been with 
small entrepeneurial undertakings, 
or with private individuals. These 
were flexible enough to put up with 
the non-standard human material 
she represented. Firms in the middle 
brackets had their sights fixed on 
expansion; they needed outworlders 
who fitted their present requirements 
and had no slack available to make 
adjustments for strangers. 

A firm as huge as the Zygra 
Company, by contrast, simply took 
it for granted that its employees did 
fit. If they didn’t actually do so the 
company ignored the fact. 

Superficially she had no cause to 
complain of the way she was treat- 
ed. Once instructed that she was 
working for the company, the com- 
puters accorded her strictly what 
she was entitled to. She was given 



an advance against salary, a bed- 
room m a subsidiary wing of the 
headquarteirs building and a sched- 
ule for her training program; she 
was medkaMy examin^ and cured 
of a minor sinus infection which had 
been bothering her since Loki; she 
was automatically interrogated un- 
der flicker-stimulaition to make cer- 
tain she wasn’t hired by some rival 
organization — ^but that she had an- 
ticipated, and could hardly resent. 

\^at wore her down, though, was 
the way in which the Zygra Com- 
pany reflected the sparse population 
of all the outworld in microcosmic 
form. Days of empty corridors, 
empty elevators, blankly closed doors 
and offices, testified to the efficien- 
cy with which human resources were 
exploited. No time wasted in going 
fix>m place to place around the 
building, nor in casual chatting. That 
habit would come back in another 
generation or two. Right now, there 
was still a shortage of n^mpower, so 
that the Zygra Company which 
owned ethe whole of a planet had 
fewer staff at its headquarters than 
aboard one of its interstellar freight- 
ers. 

A slight consolation was the fact 
that the training program was inten- 
sive. 

Shuster had said the post was a 
sinecure. That might be true, but 
the company’s computers were of an 
economical turn, as she had already 
established, and no one had tc^d 
them not to take trouble. In the id- 
timate analysis something might go 
wrong with the fabulous cybernetic 
devices on Zygra, and some crucial 
decision might laud in the lap of

IF 



the single busnian occupant of the 
planet. In that case, the computers 
apparently reasoned, said human oc- 
cupant must be equipped with the 
fullest possible knowledge of the 
situation. 

So ... 

Head ringing, she struggled to ab- 
sorb everything she was told or 
shown. A real pelt was an essential 
part of the instructional environ- 
ment. After a week, she had for- 
gotten its cash value and liked it 
solely because it was another living 
thing in this otherwise mechanical 
setting. 

Z ygra: a vegetable stew. A planet 
fractionally smailter than Earth, 
with a virtually uniform warm damp 
climate and no satellite large enough 
to generate tides. Solar attraction 
created sluggish surges in its univer- 
sal marshes — swamps — everglades 
whatever one cared to call them. But 
any term you applied was slightly 
wrong, for Zygra remained uniquely 
itself. 

The atmosphere was breathable. 
There were no organisms capable of 
infecting human tissue and equally 
there were no animals — hence no 
hostile species to exterminate. It 
would certainly have been a prize for 
colonization if it had had any dry 
land at all. 

As things stood, over ninety-nine 
per cent of the surface a human be- 
ing either swam, or sank to his waist 
in mud, or required artificial life- 
suppK>rt systems. Ky nance began to 
catch on to some of the reasons why 
nobody bad ever seriously tried to 
take possession of the planet away 



from the Zygra Company when she 
learned that the annual cost of main- 
taining the supervisor in reasonable 
comfort was equivalent to two pelts 
— about two niiillion credits. 

Another hundred thousand in sal- 
ary atop that seemed almost neg- 
ligible. 

Apart from swamp, there were 
two other notable features of the 
surface. First, and natural, the veg- 
etation: a complex as elaborate as 
any known on an Earthlike world, 
extending as Shuster had said over 
ecological chains fourteen units in 
length, climaxing in the pelts. In 
their home environment ^ey fre- 
quented certain mat-like rafts of an- 
other plant, on which parasitized 
the intervening members of the 
chain. Their incredible changeabil- 
ity, their flexibility and their scent- 
secretions seemed to be a kind of 
evolutionary luxury; no one had as- 
signed them with any c^tainty to 
adaptational measures. At the sea- 
son of maximal solar tide, their 
glory reached optimum. 

Then came the harvest, when they 
were shock-conditioned into a per- 
manent state of excitation and coat- 
ed on their underside with a solid 
solution of concentrated nutriment. 
Those so provisioned would last 
twenty to thirty years regardless of 
how they were used — tears repaired 
themselves, the shimmier and odor 
continued unabated until old age 
set in. 

No wonder the pelts were the most 
sought-after objects in the galaxy. 

The second feature of Zygra was 
artificial and recent. It was the au- 
tomated harvesting and breeding

system Shuster had mentioned. As 
he had said, it was defended against 
interference. Orbital guardposts 
would ohaiienge and destroy any 
ship emerging from qua-space with- 
out the correct recognition signals, 
even if the ship was in distress — for 
there was only one place on Zygra 
a ship could set down without sink- 
ing instantly into the swamps, and 
that was the company’s own main 
station, floating around the planet 
as the pelts migrated from raft to 
raft of their indispensable weed with 
the seasons. 

From the main station, scores 
upon scores of wholly automatic 
substations fanned out, herding the 
pelts, selecting and tagging those 
which displayed the most remark- 
able variations, culling drab ones, 
crossfertilizing sports with known 
strains to produce extra-gorgeous 
lines, prodding, poking, exciting and 
in every way directing their fate. 

Also there were factories distilling 
and concentrating the ingredients for 
the solid nourishment with which 
the export pelts had to be coated, 
telescoping five or six years of natu- 
ral processing into as many months: 
extract of yardweed fed to block- 
weeds, extract of blockweed fed to 
dinglybells, extract of dinglybell fed 
to Zygran bladderwrack, extract of 
bladderwrack fed to free-floating 
pseudosponge.* 

Gelatinized, fortified, sprayed on 
and allowed to dry. 

“I think,” Ky nance said very soft- 
ly to herself, “^at I shan’t go crazy, 
even if I am alone on the planet. I 
think it’s going to be rather inter- 
esting.” 



IV 

H orst Lampeter parted the fronds 
of the bladderwrack and peered 
over the ribbon-like expanse of tem- 
porarily open water. 

It could hardly be called a river, 
because it bad no banks. It was just 
a channel between two patches of 
mingled bladderwrack and dingly- 
bells which had used up enough of 
the nearer bondroots to let a former 
mudbank dissolve into silt and wash 
away. 

Damn this mist, blurring his view! 
Or was it the mist obscuring details? 
Were his eyes perhaps going bad on 
him? It was all too likely — a local 
diet was deficient in so many nec- 
essities, and the mere fact you could 
choke something down without vom- 
iting didn’t imply proper nutriment. 

He chopped the thought off short. 
Going blind on Zygra was too de- 
pressing an idea to be allowed to 
prey on his mind. Concentrate, he 
told himself. Concentrate! 

Instead of straining to see, he lis- 
tened. Zygra was a quiet planet — 
maddeningly quiet, lacking as it did 
any form of animal life — but there 
was always a surplus of back- 
ground noise, the plashing of open 
water, the suck and shift of subsid- 
ing mudbanks, the occasional flop 
of pelts returning to a floating phase 
from high on the edge of a weed- 
raft. What could he hear that didn’t 
belong in this normal murmuring? 

Nothing. Maybe Victor had cal- 
culated wrong after all. 

He sighed and remembered to 
shift before the bladderwrack ac- 
cumulated enough cell-strain to col-

iaipse the floats on which he was 
balancing. A man could easily get 
lost among the trailing roots and 
fail to find his way back to air in 
the minute or so he could hold his 
breath. Shadowed so that the light 
bathing him had a weird greenish 
quality, he looked down at himself. 

He was naked except for a bdt 
of plaited weed on which he had 
hung his crude wooden tods. His 
chest was shrunken, so he could 
count his ribs by eye, and his skin 
was pallid even without the green- 
ish tinge of the shadows. His feet 
and ankles felt puffy and water- 
logged. His hair and beard, grown 
long for want of any means to trim 
them, were braided together to keep 
them out of his way. 

/ must look like a bogeyman out 
of a savage's nightmare. 

Listening anew, he still caught no 
sound distinct from the ordinary. 
How to know if Victor’s calendar 
was accurate? Time in this horrible 
setting was so fluid — as fluid as the 
marshy ground, which changed and 
drifted so that one could never be 
sure where he was unless the night 
sky was clear for a change and it 
was possible to sight on the stars 
with the notched crossed sticks he 
called his “sextant”. 

And even 'if by some miracle the 
calendar was correct, to within a few 
days at least, and the time of harvest 
was really coming close, how to be 
sure that some freak of circum- 
stances wouldn’t take the pelts by the 
northern route this time? Four years 
back, they’d gone north instead of 
south in response either to a fluc- 
tuation of the climate or tide, or 



else because some bhnd machine de- 
cided this was a course more profit- 
able to the Zygra Company. 

Horst wish^ for solid ground on 
which to stamp his foot. Failing it, 
he pounded fist into palm in a fu- 
tile gesture of hatred. 

Why did people have to be this 
way — so greedy to wring the jast 
chop from a proifitable venture, even 
if the last drop was a man’s life- 
blcxxl? It was as though the pattern 
of susipicion and jealousy imposed 
by the Dictatrix’s regime had rippled 
outward from Eajth, aind now, long 
after it had died at ks point of or- 
igin, it still ruled the minds of those 
in power on the outworlds, fero- 
ciously though they would have de- 
nied the charge. 

A sound? A sort of flopping 
sound? He jumped, just in time to 
save himself from being precipi- 
tated down among the bladder- 
wrack’s root system as it collapsed a 
square meter of floats in response to 
the strain of his weight, and peered 
along the channel as he had done 
earlier. 

This time his heart gave a lurch. 
No doubt about it: those were mi- 
grating pelts! 

r iey lay on the smooth surface 
of the water with hardly a hint 
of the quality which made them so 
prized by humanity. Their upper 
sides glistened, but only from wet- 
ness. It took an eye trained by bitter 
experience to inform Horst of the 
all-important truth: that smear of 
red, that ripple of gold, overlying the 
pelts’ basic greenish-brown, fore- 
shadowed the glory of harvest. 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH

Frantically he readied beihind him 
for the bui^e of matweed fronds 
with a piece of vine from an upper 
branch of the Wadderwrack. The 
fronds were twisted and bruised so 
that they would leak their juices in- 
to the water. Without making a 
splash that could be detected at a 
distance, he set the bundle adrift. 

Moments passed. The first taste 
of juice reached the searching pelts, 
and they began to wiggle in their 
astonishing flexible manner towards 
the presumed source of the lure. 

Ho(Tst let some of the tension ooze 
away and whistled over his shoulder. 
The Wadderwrack surged underfoot 
in response to movements across its 
surface, and then the other men were 
alongside, keeping their distance 
oarefully because to have four men’s 
weight in one spot would trigger the 
collapse of the floats instantly. The 
Wadderwrack was one of many spe- 
cies of plants free-floating on the 
surface of Zygra, but no other 
seemed to have evolved the notion of 
gas-filled cysts sensitive to weight 
on the upper side. The process went 
like this: a seed or spore would 
settle on the float, feed there until it 
was heavier than a certain critical 
load, at which pK)int the collapse of 
the bladder dropped it underwater 
and it became food for the larger 
plant, entwined among root-tendrils 
and squeezed of its sap. 

A man’s weight speeded the pro- 
cess so that it cycled to completion 
in three to eight minutes. Nothing 
on Zygra was solid and stable. 

“They’re pelts all right,” Victor 
mutitered, adding in a tone of weak 
triumph, “Didn’t I say so?” 



Scrawny, skin yellow and bagging* 
his large head w^bling on his tiiia 
neck, he chuckled ihis self-approba- 
tion. 

“Shut up,” Coberley told him. 
Insofar as there could be a leader 
in this situation, Coberley was 
theirs. He was neither cleverer than 
Victor — whose IQ, in his normal 
phase, must run close to genius level 
— nor more skillful than Horst, who 
was anyway fifteen years younger. 
But he fed on some invisible source 
of energy, probably hatred*, and he 
was always the one who found the 
willpower to continue when the 
natural impulse was to weary sur- 
render. He was a former fat man. 
Now he was puffy, his skin loose 
without substance beneath to round 
it and firm it. 

“I don’t see a monitor,” Coberley 
went on. “What do we do if we’ve 
picked up a stray herd? There arc 
some, you know. In a good year a 
few escape the monitors and wander 
about on their own.” 

“Kill them!” Victor shrilled. “Rip 
them up and ruin them! Cost the 
company a million for every one we 
kill!” 

“Shut wp,” Coberley repeated, 
this time with malice, and Victor 
complied. They waited. And at last, 
at last, the monitor came in sight: 
awash in the water, barely protrud- 
ing above the herd of pelts, but hid- 
ing beneath its flush narrow deck a 
store of miracles. 

They sighed in unison. “Sol- 
omon!” Coberley snapped, and the 
fourth member of the party ac- 
knowledged with a cautious pace to- 
wards the edge of the channel.

IF 




S olomon Weit was going to make 
tiheir bid simply because, having 
been here a shorter time than any of 
his companions, he was stronger 
and quicker. Even so, he was a 
shadow of what he had once been. 
He was an immensely tall man, 
three-quarters of African extraction. 
Horst had always found something 
oddly comforting in his very dark- 
ness. It brought to mind solid things: 
blocks of ebony, ingots of bronze. 
He seemed to resist the leeching 
soddenness of Zygra while all the 
others grew wan and feeble. 

Yet he had lately begun to cough 
on cool nights, and his eyes were 
rimmed with red. 

“Now?” he said. 

“Now,” confirmed Coberley, and 
they threw themselves flat on their 
bellies, distributing their weight over 
a wide enough area of the bladder- 
wrack to delay its collapse a few 
precious extra minutes. 

Plunging their hands into the 
water as the pelts surged by, they 
struggled to get a grip on their clam- 
my edges. 

If the people who pay a million 
could get them in the raw state, they 
wouldn't he so eager, Horst thought 
for the hundredth time, or the hun- 
dred thousandth. 

“Got one!” Solomon exclaimed, 
and the others rolled closer, helping 
him to haul it from the water. Patch- 
es of white and navy-blue shimmered 
over its upper end. They didn’t 
stop to admire the play of color, but 
laid it flat and held it down so that 
Solomon could slide on to it and get 
it wrapped securely around him. 
In response to the contact, it sub- 



sided and began to conform to him. 

“Damnation, it’s too advanced!” 
Coberley miuttered. “Look, it’s cling- 
ing already. We needed an unripe 
one which would take on a random 
shape — ” 

‘Too late to worry about that,” 
Horst countered. “Just have to hope 
k fools the monitor anyway. Unless 
you feel it’s not safe, Solomon?” 

The dark man looked al the mon- 
itor from the shadow of a kind of 
hood into which he had prodded and 
teased the pelt. “I don’t think there’s 
time to get it off atKi catch another,” 
he grunted. “And we daren’t miss 
this chance! It may take weeks to get 
within reach of another monitor. 
Give me the hammer, quickly!” 

Horst detached the “hammer” 
from his belt. It was only a piece of 
wood, first gnawed into a club- 
shape and then dried, over heart- 
breaking weeks, in the intermittent 
sunlight until it was harder than 
most things on Zygra. Solomon 
closed his fist around it and wriggled 
to the very edge of the bladder- 
wrack. 

“A ripe one may not be a bad 
idea,” Victor suggested. “The mon- 
itor is more likely to try and retrieve 
a ripe one, isn’t it?” 

“Shut up,” Coberley told him 
again. 

Tense, they held their breath as 
the monitor drew abreast of the 
pelt enshrouding Solomon. It sensed 
the presence of its responsibility, 
slow^ down and bobbed towards 
the side of the channel. Victor whim- 
pered faintly. 

Relays evaluated, circuits closed. 
The monitOT decided that this pelt 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



23 




ought not to be stranded and left 
behind, but returned to the herd. 
Arms reached out from its nearer 
handling unit, closed tenderly on the 
pelt and Solomon too, lifted the load 
and made to swing across the low 
deck so it could be replaced in mid- 
channel — exactly as we hoped, 
Horst reminded himself without ex- 
citement. His mouth was dry and 
his guts were churning. 

Go to it, Solomon. Make it come 
true all the way! 

H ow many long lonely hours of 
planning, how many dreams 
and arguments, had led to this mo- 
ment! Now, now Solomon was mak- 
ing his bid for mastery of the little 
vessel. In mid-air stripping off the 
pelt with huge sucking noises, start- 
ling the monitor and throwing it 
over to the seldom-used interference 
circuits. He dropped awkwardly on 
the deck, almost losing his footing as 
the impact drove the monitor com- 
pletely below the surface. His “ham- 
mer” rose and fell with a slam on 
the base of the handling unit, crack- 
ing the plastic across and letting 
v/ater into unproofed circuits so 
that steam spurted out and some- 
thing hissed as if in rage. 

The arms let go the pelt and it 
fell in the water. Solomon paid no 
attention. With all his might he was 
trying to extend that crack right 
across the monitor’s hull, work 
havoc that would force the machine’s 
return to the main station for servic- 
ing and carry him ignorantly with 
it. 

“Look out!” 

Who called? Horst realized with 



amazement that it had been his own 
voice, and he had ^K>ken too late. 
The handling unit on the other side 
of the monitor was intact, and k 
sprang into action. Two huge arms 
snatched Solomon off the deck. The 
power surged and the stern-jets 
screamed, driving the hull into mid- 
channel again. The arms shot out 
to full stretch and let Solomon go. 
He plunged into the bladderwrack 
beyond the channel, screaming, and 
the scream ended abruptly as the 
glugging noise of collapsing floats 
greeted his fall. 

There was a period of worse than 
silence, during which the monitor 
evaluated its own damage, decided 
it was still servicable, and resumed 
the pursuit of its pelts. When it was 
out of sight, Horst stirred. 

“There’s nothing else for it,” ho 
said. “If we’re going to get off 
Zygra alive we’ll have to tackle the 
main station.” 

“You’re crazy!” Victor shrilled. 
“If we can’t even take a monitor, 
what chance have we of — ?” 

“I’d rather be crazy than dead,” 
Horst whispered. “At least ... I 
think I would.” 

V 

W hen the announcement reached 
Kynance, it was bald and to 
the point. 

“The previous incumbent of the 
post of supervisor of Zygra has 
failed to exercise his option of a 
further year’s employment. Kindly 
ready yourself for departure aboard 
the starship Zygra One at fourteen 
hundred tomorrow.”

She looked at k a second time md 
gave a sigh. She reminded herself 
about the repatriation clause and 
wondered if the attraction of a 
guaranteed tiip home was going to 
lose its glamor in the same way as 
zygra pelts already had done. 

Suppose the “previous incumbent** 
bad exercised his option. What 
would they have done with her, hav- 
ing stuffed her mind full of so much 
information? Washed it alii out 
again? Kept her on the staff in 
some minor capacity for a year and 
then sent her to Zygra after all? 

No, more likely just turned her 
loose. In the history of the company 
someone at some stage must have 
decided to stay on a second year at 
the last moment, but the trainee re- 
placement would have learned the 
same crucial fact that Ky nance had 
grown to accept: just as the Zygra 
Comply had given up misleading 
its rivals by making them think the 
pelts were animal skins, so it had 
given up worrying about how much 
an outsider knew of the technical- 
ities involved. There was no place in 
the universe where the data were of 
value except on Zygra itself. Launch- 
ing an attack on the planet with a 
view to taking it over was still a 
possibility — there were other oper- 
ators in this sector of the galaxy 
capable of mounting one or even 
two assaults fierce enough to defeat 
the Zygra Company’s best efforts. 
But the main station and substations 
were all booby-trapped. If they 
ceased to receive a signal being 
broadcast by the orbital guardposts, 
they released a flood of poison in- 
to the water, and for at least the 



next fifty years, until the pelts re- 
establish^ themselves, there would 
be no cfop worth harvesting. And 
without destroying all the guardposts 
there was no chance of making a 
landing. 

Moreover there was nowhere to 
land in the literal sense, so that a 
ship designed to put down on the 
marshes instead of aboard the deck 
of the main station was bound to be 
a somewhat peoiUiar vessel, bulging 
with flotation chambers and equip- 
ped with some sort of seagoing 
propulsion. 

As part of her training she had 
been shown the record of one ill- 
starred venture along these lines. 
The Zygra Company’s spies had dis- 
covered the preparations being made 
to adapt a ship belonging to a com- 
pany on Loki, had waited till the 
work was almost done — ^involving 
the expenditure of half the rival 
company’s capital — and then had 
blandly notified the Nefertitian gov- 
ernment, which had a considerable 
stake itself in the Zygra operation, 
through the tax bills it imposed on 
the company’s headquarters. 

A protest to the Lokian author- 
ities — a swoop by a team of inspec- 
tors from the Bureau of Intersteller 
Trade — and a swinging claim for 
damages which bankrupted the 
would-be pirates. 

It was with something of a shock 
that, towards the end of the didactic 
recital, Ky nance recognized a case 
which she had many times had 
dinned into her in college. “Manu- 
facture of a device or devices un- 
iquely fitted to conditions pertaining 
on a world not legally accessible to 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



25 




the manufacturer is prima facie ev- 
idence of piratical intent” — The Zy- 
gra Company and the Government 
of Nefertiti versus Wade, Wang and 
Hoerbiger, 2113, otherwise irrever- 
ently known as the smile on the face 
of the zygra. 

At first she had wondered why 
the company didn’t simply assign 
members of its own staff to hold 
down the chair for a year at a time, 
r^erhaps on a rota basis. Later she 
had realized this was contrary to out- 
world psychology. Anyone making 
a career with the company was 
trained for work far more import- 
ant than sitting on Zygra and watch- 
ing a lot of machines tending a lot of 
moss. Any casual applicant, reason- 
ably greedy and moderately intelli- 
gent, would suffice, would cost no 
more than salary for a year and 
ship-room to and from the Zygra 
system plus a course of training 
that occupied a mere fraction of the 
computers’ attention, and would be 
dismissable on his return without 
he company having to worry any 
iiore about him. 

If someone with inside informa- 
tion about harvesting the pelts want- 
'd to sell out to another company, 
he‘d have to have experience at the 
headquarters end as well as on Zy- 
gra, and if he worked well enough 
to rise in the .firm to a level where 
his knowledge was likely to be use- 
ful to a third party, he’d have to be 
either a fool or a maniac to risk the 
gamble. 

Ky nance was coming to admire 
the Zygra Company in an upside- 
down fashion. There was no deny- 
ing their efficient cynicism. 



As the reluctant admiration grew, 
so her original doubts subsided. Tliis 
was no chiselling two-bit undertak- 
ing, which could add to its profit 
margin by a fat percentage if it 
weasel ed on its employment con- 
tracts. 'This was a firm big enough 
and inarguably profitable enough to 
tolerate such minor budget items as 
repatriation of an Earthsider. Five 
extra per cent on the freight charges 
for a single consignment of Earth- 
bound pelts would more ‘ than ab- 
sorb her passage home. 

And she was not going to give 
them the slightest hint, the slightest 
suggestion of a hint, that she had 
infringed the contract. 

S ince the interview at which she 
was engaged, she hadn’t seen 
Shuster again. He was the first per- 
son she spotted when she presented 
herself at the spaceport an hour 
ahead of the scheduled time, and 
she recalled with sick anticipation 
that he had claimed to be directly 
in charge of the Zygra supervisors, 
so there was no chance of eluding 
him. 

She put a bold face on things 
and marched smartly towards him. 
The group of spacemen with whom 
he was talking noticed her before 
he did, and one or two of them 
stared in a flattering manner. Then 
the senior among them, a lean type 
with second-mate braids on his 
tunic, tapped Shusiter’s arm and 
pointed towards her. 

“What’s the girl doing here, d’you 
know?” The words carried distinct- 
ly above the racket from the stem- 
gates of the ship, where auto-hand- 



26 



IF 




lers were packing in empty pelt- 
crates that rang with hollow booms 
every time they were moved. 

Shuster half-tumed and recog- 
nized her. Was he still smarting from 
the smack on the face? She couldn’t 
tell by his expression, or by the tone 
he used to answer the inquiry. 

“Her? Oh, that’s the new super- 
visor taking over from Evan.” 
“What?” The second mate re- 
coiled as though he’d been struck 
under the chin, and two or three of 
his companions exclaimed simul- 
taneously. “Now look here, Exe- 
cutive! You can’t do a thing like that 
to — ’ 

“Shut your mouth,” Shuster told 
him coolly. “If you want to keep 
your berth aboard this ship . .?” 
The last word rose to a gently ques- 
tioning note, and the second mate 
swallowed hard and held his tongue. 
Eyes searching for some clue to 
the reason for the outburst, all her 
misgivings returning in full force, 
Kynance stopped a pace distant 
from Shuster. 

“Congratulations,” he said icily. 
“I’m informed you’re the best trainee 
the company has ever had for the 
post you’re taking on.” 

“Thanks,” Kynance muttered. It 
seemed safest to stifle her dislike of 
the man until he made some overt 
reference to the reason for it. 

Let him just try and talk me out 
of it again! 

“Executive!” the second mate 
said. “Does that mean you won’t — ?” 
“If you poke your snout in one 
more time where it doesn’t belong,” 
Shuster snapped, “I’ll cut it off. Is 
that clear?” 



Kynance shivered. The looks on 
all these faces, except Shuster’s own, 
were such as she would only have 
expected to see at a funeral. There 
must be a catch in the deal after all 
— ^that was the only explanation! 

But she’d assured herself there 
couldn’t be, because the Zygra 
Company was too prosperous to 
bother with cheating its casual em- 
ployees. Anyway, what sort of cheat- 
ing was possible? By now she could 
have recited the contract word for 
word from memory. There wasn’t a 
loophole. The grounds for voiding 
it were set forth clearly as anyone 
could wish. Provided she kept her 
head she’d last out the year. 

“Go to your cabin,” Shuster was 
saying. “It’s clearly arrowed from 
this lock here: number ninety. And 
remember that you are not to in- 
terfere with the running of this ship 
in anyway. Delaying a crewman in 
the exercise of his duty constitutes 
interference, and when the ship is at 
space all crewmen are considered to 
be on duty twenty-four hours a day. 
In short, you will break your con- 
tract and lose your .chance of re- 
patriation if you talk to anybody ex- 
cept me. Is that understood?” 

He could have been reading her 
mind. Her plan had been formed a 
moment earlier: to corner one of 
these glum-looking men and pump 
him for explanations. He’d sensed 
it, and forestalled her with orders 
given before witnesses. Pretty girl 
or no pretty girl, a spaceman in the 
lucrative zygra trade wasn’t going 
to jeopardize ids career for her sake. 

Was he? 

Hopefully she surveyed the men

one last time, and re..d in iheir 
shrugs thait they were resigned to 
her fate, whatever it was. 

Why not? Ifs not going to hap- 
pen to them! 

Abruptly she discovered that she 
hated the Zygra Company and Shus- 
ter as iits persomficaitioiQ, because 
contact with hdm had made her so 
bitter that s>he seemed like a stranger 
to herself. 

With weary apathy she entered the 
ship and found her cabin. Surround- 
ed by the noise of preparations for 
takeoff, she stowed her gear and 
sat down on the bunk. 

I n five or ten minutes — she had 
lost track of the time — Shuster 
came calling. 

Shifty-eyed, he slipped through 
the door and pushed it dosed quick- 
ly. He gave her a quick false smile 
and spoke in low tones. 

“Fm sorry I haven’t been able to 
see you since our first meeting, my 
dear, but Fve been tremendously 
busy. Youll understand that the 
company’s business follows the same 
life-rhythm as the pelts themselves, 
ha-ha! And as the time for harvest- 
ing approaches so we find ourselves 
more and more frantically busy. 
But I have kept a dose eye on your 
progress and I must say that despite 
your lack of what we generally lay 
down as minimum qualifications for 
entering our employment, that’s to 
say a scholar degree in some major 
fidd, you’ve done very well. It 
might easily be possible to arrange 
for you to join the company’s per- 
manent staff on completion of your 
tour at .Zygra . 



All this time he had been dosing 
the distance between them. Now fai 
was sitting next to her, hands re- 
turning to the very same positions 
from which she had pushed them on 
the former occasion — same posi- 
tions, and same revulsion. 

She detested men who were so 
egotistical their preliminaries lo 
love-making followed a pattern ltk» 
a computer program, fixed and un- 
alterable, so that a girl could never 
tell if they were thinking of her, or 
the last partner, or the next. She 
gritted her teeth, forcing herself to 
stay calm in the hope of picking up 
some due to the pitfall she had over- 
looked. 

There must be one. She was con- 
vinced she had deluded herself about 
something. 

“I think perhaps that during the 
voyage we could become quite 
good friends, don’t you? And a word 
from me in praise of your ability 
could carry a lot of weight with the 
firm, you know.” 

Fumble, maul, squeeze — no, it was 
more than she could stand. She didn’t 
slap him this time, but made h^ 
voice sound as though she wanted 
to when she said stonily, “I’m 
sorry, but I’m not interested in a 
career with the company. I want to 
get home, and if it takes a year on 
Zygra to do it I’ll spend a year on 
Zygra.” 

He withdrew, flushing, and stood 
up. For a second she thought he was 
going to hurl some taunt at her, re- 
veal how he believed he had tricked 
her, but he bit down hard on his 
shiny-wet lower lip and went silent- 
ly out.

U nder the shower Dickery Evan 
stretched and yawned. He 
was a stocky, well-biiillt young man 
of New Zealand extraction, the 
Maori side predominating. 

Dry, but not having bothered to 
dress, he padded to the autochef and 
dialed breakfast, then carried it to 
the dome overlooking the main sta- 
tion’s landing-deck. 

He’d thought at first that but for 
that deck, the largest solid surface on 
Zygra, he’d have gone crazy. Now, 
at the end of his tour, he wasn’t so 
sure. He’d considered putting in for 
an extension"; this was the only way 
he’d ever draw down so handsome 
a salary, and the complete isolation 
was growing easier to bear, but for 
one thing — ^no women. 

Still, it was too late for that now. 
Ihere was less than one month be- 
fore his time expired. Best that way, 
perhaps — ‘he wouldn’t want to get 
too used to being alone. 

He thought of the girls he planned 
to look up when he got home, and 
the time he could give them with his 
accumulated pay . , not all of it, 
of course, because he planned to 
keep himself and a succession of 
girls on it the rest of his life. If he 
bought a share in some promising 
enterprise, and started a small busi- 
ness, and acquired some land and 
had a house put on it ... 

His mind ran on happily as he 
watched the monitors drifting to- 
wards the main station. They were 
riding the same sluggish currents 
that the pelts followed to their ren- 
dezvous with harvest. Since his ar- 



rival they’d been all over the planet. 

The trail of the pelts was im- 
mensely long; by harvest-time, 
scarcely one had less than 20,000 
kilometers to its credit. 

Early on, he’d passed much time 
in figuring how to get a pelt off 
Zygra. There was one girl in par- 
ticular he thought would look mar-" 
vdous in a pelt and nothing else. 
Then he’d found out various dis- 
couraging facts, such as how the 
pelts felt when they hadn’t been 
treated and coated with the solid 
nourishment necessary to their sur- 
vival, and that every one selected 
for export was watched by keen 
computers, and that there was no 
chance of stealing a batch of pre- 
pared nutriment from the coating- 
station. 

That had put paid to a sub- 
sidiary ambition, too. He’d consid- 
ered the idea of setting up a pelt re- 
furbisher. Plenty of rich folks whose 
pelts were wearing out would pay 
ten thousand for a fresh coating 
of nutriment; someone who could 
buy two in a lifetime was rarer than 
pelts themselves! , 

But he wasn’t a good enough 
chemist to duplicate natural nutri- 
ment, and he concluded that if the 
proposition was economic the Zygra 
Company would have established the 
service themselves. 

Besides, somebody was bound to 
have tried and failed already, just 
as they’d tried and failed to breed 
pelts elsewhere than on Zygra. Best 
to be content with what he was 
going to come by honestly; a hun- 
dred thousand credits, free passage 
home, and an undemanding existence 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



2 ? 




for the rest of his life — natural, 
or geriatrically extended. 

^ He dozed, while the watery sun- 
^ light sifted over the gathering pelts, 
and the monitors closing in, and 
_ the bulk of the coating-station 
looming on the horizon at its reg- 
ular station among a particularly 
rich patch of weed, automatically 
distilling huge vats of nutriment 
against the harvest. 

H e came awake with a jolt. Some- 
where at the edge of conscious- 
ness: a shrilling noise. What the — 1 
Oh, no\ He’d heard that before, at 
the beginning of his stay. The man 
who’d been showing him over — 
Sheister, Shuster, some such name 
— had turned a switch and an alarm 
had squalled for precisely thirty 
seconds. 

And he’d said, “That may go 
off any time, day or night! It in- 
dicates a malfunction of the auto- 
matics. You heard how long I let 
it run for? When it sounds, you 
have thirty seconds and no more to 
reach this switch and cut it off, 
survey the operation, and report 
what you find. It may only be a test 
to ensure you’re alert. But I warn 
you: if you fail to reach here in 
thirty seconds — ” 

Evan headed for the switch at 
a dead run. 

He missed on the first grab, got 
it on the second. His skin was prick- 
ly with sweat. How long had it been 
sounding before he reacted? Franti- 
cally he surveyed the telltale boards; 
as far as he could tell, everything 
was as right as it ought to be. So 
this had been a test! The bastards! 



The radiated pigs! To leave him 
eleven months, then catch him nap- 
ping! 

He made his way back to where 
he had been dozing and timed him- 
self on his run to the switch. The 
first time it took him fifteen sec- 
onds, the next, seventeen. 

There was nothing for it. Unless 
he was to be cheated of his pay and 
passage home, he had to doctor the 
record of the time the alarm had 
sounded. It was a terrible decision, 
because tampering with the auto- 
matics constituted . sabotage and 
voided his contract, but he wasn’t 
going to let one lapse cancel a year 
of his life. 

He slid up the front panel of the 
alarm unit and peered into its bow- 
els. Straightforward enough — a 
band of white tape, calibrated in 
one-second intervals, had reeled out 
like a dry tongue from the base erf 
the siren. All he had to do was ease 
it back so that about twenty-five of 
the gradations showed instead of the 
present damning total of forty-nine. 

He grasped the tape. 

Instantly the panel slammed 
down, smashing the bones of his 
forearm. He screamed and tried to 
tear free, feeling the raw ends of 
bone scrape agonizingly. Through a 
fire of pain he heard an impersonal 
voice. 

“Unauthorized tampering with the 
automatics is sabotage! Accordingly 
you are no longer an employee of 
the Zygra Company.” 

“No!” he screamed, wrenching 
loose his shattered arm and cradling 
it in the other. Stumbling, he made 
for the medicare unit, a coffin-sized 



30 



ir 




block of automatics sited at the base 
of the observation dome. He pushed 
its switches awkwardly with his good 
hand. 

“You are no longer an employee 
of the Zygra Company,” said the 
unit. 

“Wha-a-at?” Evan barely knew 
the voice for his own. “But you 
can’t do this — it’s inhuman!” 

hey could. 

Having set his arm in a sort 
of splint, he settled to his own satis- 
faction that no automatic device was 
prepared to serve him now. Even 
the autochef spat burned fat at him, 
and the shower delivered a stream 
of boiling water. In the smoke and 
steam his ambitions evaporated: 
good-by house, good-by girls, good- 
by geriatric treatment, good-by Dick- 
ery Evan. He’d been told, and had 
believed, that without life-support 
systems no one could survive on 
Zygra. He’d starve before the har- 
vesting ship was due. 

“Then I’ll make sure they don’t 
enjoy what they’ve done to me,” 
he promised between clenched teeth, 
and went in search of a weapon. 

But he had only chopped up one 
pelt before the nearest monitor seiz- 
ed him in its powerful arms, car- 
ried him off adross the swamps and 
abandoned him to his fate on a mat 
of drifting weed. The force with 
which he was dumped blotted out 
his consciousness. 

VII 

A rms aching, hands sore from the 
crude paddle, Horst kept think- 



ing how real this work made Sol- 
omon’s loss seem. Their boat was 
clumsy enough anyway, consisting of 
a rough frame supported on half a 
hundred pieces of bladderwrack, the 
cysts inflated by lungpower and seal- 
ed with a gummy exudation of din- 
glybells. Every day it was necessary 
to replace the cysts which were 
starting to rot. 

But Solomon had driven his blade 
harder than Horst and Coberley put 
together. Victor could be ignored; 
he often fainted after a couple of 
hours in full sun. Also Solomon had 
been able to crack jokes, and sing 
in a resonant bass. 

Now he rots among the roots. 
He*d have made a joke of that, too. 

“Take the right side of that weed 
ahead!” Victor piped. 

“Does it matter?” Coberley 
snarled. “We don’t know we’re in 
the same hemisphere as the damned 
coating-station!” 

“We are,” Victor insisted, close 
to tears. Horst suspected he and 
Coberley too had been affected by 
the death of Solomon, though none 
of them had said so. Coberley had 
been more than ever irascible since, 
while Victor had taken to whimper- 
ing aloud. 

“We’ve seen monitors,” Victor 
went on. “We’ve seen ripe pelts. 
Haven’t I sat up all night taking 
star-sightings while you two snored 
your heads off?” 

“And haven’t you snored your 
head off while we sweat over the 
paddles?” Coberley thundered back. 

“Don’t argue,” Horst pleaded 
wearily, not really hoping to silence 
them. But for a while after that 




THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



31 




they simply forged ahead, turning to 
the right to miss the patch of weed. 

Horst didn’t look at it except to 
* make sure they were clear of its 
fringe of roots. He was more ccm- 
< cerned about the risk of it being 
^ grounded on a mudbank, in whidi 
case they’d have to backtrack. Vic- 
tor’s shrill cry startled him. 

“Look! On the edge of the mat!** 

Their heads jerked around. On 
the very edge of the mat, half in 
the water, lay a man with one arm 
crudely bandaged. There was only 
one explanation of his presence, 
which Coberley voiced by implica- 
tion. 

“Damn the Zygra Company! May 
Shuster rot eternity away!” 

“You think that’s the latest of 
the supervisors? Then we are m 
the right area of the planet!” Vic- 
tor exulted. 

“He may have been drifting for 
weeks,” Coberley blazed. “Anyway, 
they wouldn’t have trapped him till 
the last possible moment, so we can 
be sure the harvesting ship is due 
now.” 

“I wonder if he’s still alive,” 
Horst whispered. 

He was. The pain from his arm 
while they wrestled him aboard made 
him moan, and when they squeezed 
the sour but nourishing juice of a 
dinglybell into his mouth he cursed 
loudly. The cursing ran dry. He sur- 
veyed them in mingled wonder and 
dismay, naked as he was himself, 
sick-looking, wild -haired. 

“You too?” he said. 

“Us too,” Horst agreed. 

And in that instant they heard 
what they had hoped not to hear 



before sighting the main station: 
the drumming across the sky that 
marked the arrival of a spaceship. 

“Are we far from the main sta- 
tion?” Victor asked hopefully. 

“How should I know?” the man 
with the broken arm grunted. “I 
may have been unconscious for 
days!” 

S huster was a man capable of 
nurturing a grudge until the 
time was ripe for getting his own 
back. Kynance realized the fact 
with a sinking heart when she dis- 
covered that even when the ship 
had set down on Zygra he meant 
to keep her from talking to sym- 
pathetic crewmen. 

“Harvesting is no concern of 
yours,” he snapped. “Your responsi- 
bility begins when the pelts are 
aboard, and ends when we come 
back next time — if you’re still 
contracted to us.” 

He said that with peculiar re- 
lish. Whether it was his private in- 
tention or the policy of the com- 
pany, Kynance knew some effort 
was going to be made to trick her. 
Almost certainly, the trick would 
come at the end of her tour, when 
she had lost the chance to apply 
for an extension. It would be less 
trouble to injure her deliberately 
and leave her in the grip of life- 
sustaining prosthetics — but there 
was Laban Rex Chan versus Gun- 
ther Ranji to consider: “the exer- 
cise of a contractual option is im- 
possible if the person allegedly exer- 
cising it is not conscious”, but for 
which they might have Zygra “oc- 
cupied” by zombies.

IF 




What horrible byways her mind 
was being led down by this disgust- 
ing man! Mustn’t. Mustn’t. That 
path led to insanity. She sneaked a 
look out of her cabin. If she stole 
very quietly to watch the loading of 
the pelts, surely even Shuster 
wouldn’t invoke that petty disobedi- 
ence as breach of contract! 

She reached a lock unchallenged 
and stood drinking in the scene. 
Close at hand, men and machines 
were crating treated pelts from the 
coating-station; the colors flr.red 
dizzily and the scents made the air 
almost unbreathable. Russet and 
tawny, white and scarlet and green 
and black and other tints without 
names but the same fantastic beau- 
ty .. 

Men conducting checks of the au- 
tomatics: here, re-stocking the life- 
support systems with vitamins and 
proteins; at the coating-station, test- 
ing the concentrators; overhauling 
monitors — one there with a bad 
crack in the case of its handling 
unit — and installing new programs 
for breeding from sports. They’d 
said something about evolving a 
striped pelt. 

“Ah, there you are.” 

The voice made her skin crawl. 
She turned and saw Shuster. But 
he wasn’t going to complain about 
her being here. He was simply say- 
ing, “It’s about time I gave you your 
on-the-spot briefing.” He sounded 
almost affable; Kynance followed 
him. 

Mentally she ticked off all the 
ways she could be caught out in 
breach of her contract. She planned 
to list them later. For example, this 



alarm siren sounding for only thirty 
seconds. She’d have to rig some sort 
of extension so it could be inac- 
tivated from a dozen points instead 
of one. 

Tampering with the automatics; 
hence, sabotage? No — Bellamy 
versus Guy and Guy Starlines: “a 
switch designed for manual opera- 
tion is not an automatic device.” 

The prospect of doing soniething 
to forestall Shuster’s skullduggery 
cheered her. Only one cloud still 
hung over her. Where was her pre- 
decessor? She ventured to ask Shus- 
ter, and his only reply was to curl 
his lip. 

Her stomach turned over with a 
lurch. 

What can they have done to him? 
Drowned him? If they have, who*s 
going to know? 

Nobody ever came to Zygra ex- 
cept company employees. By law 
there had to be a record of the 
operation of the automatics for 
government inspection — Hughes 
and Leblanc versus Mario della 
Casa, 2092 — but the government 
was that of Nefertiti, and it had a 
huge stake in Zygra itself. 

Panic gripped her. No one from 
Earth would come hunting her if she 
failed to return. Was the contract 
irrelevant, a scrap of paper? The 
world seemed to spin off its axis as 
she learned the reason for Shuster’s 
geniality. 

“About your predecessor, now. 
He willfully infringed his contract 
You’re a great one for legalisms, 
so you’re welcome to sec the proof 
we’ll be displaying to the govern- 
ment.” 



TliE LONG WAY TO EARTH

So / was right; that is one of 
their main traps, Kynance thought, 
almost relieved. 

“ — and the automatics ceased to 
recognize him as an employee. Oh, 
and on a related point: of the last 
nine supervisors, not one has com- 
pleted his contract without infring- 
ing one of its clauses. Didn’t I tell 
you you should reconsider your ap- 
plication? Well, it’s too late now, of 
course. On your own pretty head be

S he was not going to give Shus- 
ter the privilege of seeing her 
break down. Somehow she main- 
tained her self control — so well, 
that the last time he glanced back 
before entering the starship his face 
revealed gratifying uncertainty, as to 
say: am I the one who*s overlooked 
something? 

She gave a mocking wave, which 
he did not return. He did not look 
at her again. 

The deck of the main station 
thrummed to the warning of the 
interstellar drive. The ship lifted. For 
the first meter or so the station 
rose also, floating higher for the 
reduction of weight. A crack of 
daylight appeared under the polish- 
ed hull, and the starship was on its 
way. 

It was gone. 

That was when Kynance had lo 
burst into tears. 

She had never in her life felt so 
psychologically naked. When the 
sobs allowed her to draw breath, 
she cursed everyone she could think 



of to blame for her plight, begin- 
ning with the college tutors who had 
made her believe in the actuality of 
galactic law, concluding with her- 
self. 

The tears purged her of terror, 
and when they ended she was able 
to think with a clear mind. One fac- 
tor dominated her thoughts: the 
problem of enforcement of what 
Shuster had contemptuously called 
“legalisms”. 

It was time to take a hard look 
at the predicament she was in, and 
gamble everything including her life 
on the assumption that Shuster had 
been telling the truth when he sour- 
ly complimented her on being the 
best-ever candidate to apply for this 
post. 

Why? Start there, and the rest 
would follow. 

Well ... the same reason which 
prevented the Zygra Company from 
assigning the post to their own em- 
ployees must operate when it came 
to finding an outside candidate. Any- 
one capable of making a career in 
outworld society would already be 
grabbed by some other employer. 
Even for a year at an enormous 
salary people would be reluctant to 
quit their permanent employment 
and sit watching moss grow. 

In effect, this was an unskilled 
job. But for the legal requirement 
that a celestial body must be oc- 
cupied by a human being to main- 
tain ownership, nobody would live 
here at all. 

What unskilled labor was avail- 
able on worlds where ten-year-old 
children were already productive 
members of society? Social misfits.

IF 




:rnd immigrants lacking qualifica- 
tions with which they could com- 
pete on even terms against native 
outworlders. 

Now what about her assumption 
that the Nefertiti government had a 
vested interest in the continuance 
of the Zygra Company. Although the 
tax bill for the company must be 
enormous, would it not be infinitely 
more profitable to annex this unique 
world and operate it directly? Of 
course! Hence the Zygra Company 
would be constrained to comply with 
the galactic commercial laws, for 
fear of dispossession. When Shuster 
ftlked of displaying records from 
Zygra to government inspectors, 
then, he wasn’t referring to a mere 
formality. 

Her predecessors, though, had all 
been maneuvered into breaking their 
contracts. Why? Surely immigrants 
desperate for costly but compulsory 
repatriation would be a minority 
among unskilled workers applying 
for this post? 

A great light dawned on her. 
Short of finding some crazy her- 
mit, who might go out of his head 
and start sabotaging the fabulous 
automatics here, the company stood 
no chance of finding a permanent 
supervisor. After a period of years, 
scattered around the local systems 
there would be several exsupervisors 
of Zygra. By picking their brains, 
an enterprising rival firm might 
garner r^ufficient data to mount a 
successful raid. An accumulation of 
small facts might reveal far more 
than planting a company spy to ap- 
ply for the post. 

She frowned. She had reached 



two oppose(l conclusions, one re^- 
suring, one terrifying. The Zygra 
Company might have to watch its 
step carefully, but she felt it was 
paranoically afraid tiiat its secrets 
might somehow leak out. 

What could she do to insure the 
balance tipped in her favor td the 
end of her tour? 

She had to take it for granted 
the company could not just murder 
her. If this were possible without 
the Nefertiti government stepping in, 
she was as good as lost the minute 
she entered Shuster’s office. 

A fter a little more thought she 
decided that, typically, her 
predecessors would have been social 
misfits without permanent careers 
or qualifications enabling them to 
switch jobs at will. Even such peo- 
ple, however, would have some kind 
of ties — relatives, at least. And 
if they disappeared on Zygra some- 
one might make inquiries. Nine sets 
of relatives could excite enough pub- 
lic outcry for the government to ex- 
propriate the company. 

So they would ideally seek mis- 
fits who lacked kinfolk to ask awk- 
ward questions. They would be very 
rare on planets like Nefertiti. Un- 
derpopulation implied an obsessive 
urge to exploit human resources; 
isolation would make family ties 
more precious than on Earth; and 
finally, if anyone became actively 
antisocial rather than merely asocial, 
the government would probably or- 
der psychiatric treatment. 

Kynance Foy, with her Earthside 
college degrees, was a very different 
proposition from some neurotic Ne- 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



35 




fertitian precariously poised between 
nonconformity and psychotherapy! 

Moreover, just as she had brought 
a load of preconceptions about the 
force of law with her from Earth, 
so the computers which made the 
decisions of the Zygra Company 
would predicate its plans on vul- 
nerable axioms. Hadn’t Shuster 
blanched to learn she had studied 
law? Why, if not because the com- 
pany was flying a perilously tight 
orbit? 

“Studholme and Zacharias versus 
Perseus Asteroid Mining Company, 
2011,” she murmured aloud. “A 
contract entered into with intent 
to deceive or defraud is not a valid 
contract entered into between the 
parties.” 

How far did that term extend? 
Did it include the setting of traps 
to make the victim break the con- 
ditions of employment? Chin in 
hand, she concentrated on what she 
remembered of the great trail-blaz- 
ing precedents with a ferocity at 
which her college instructors would 
have been astonished. Gubbins and 
Kinoshita versus Loki Rhodium 
Monopoly, 2102: “A company is a 
corporate counterpart of the individ- 
ual; hence individuals and compan- 
ies enter contracts with equal status” 
— not very helpful, as most judges 
tended to be influenced by Judge 
Petropavloy’S subsequent institution- 
alization for senile dementia . 

What a house of cards the law 
was! How many people’s lives had 
been affected by what a judge ate 
for breakfast! 

She rose determinedly. She could 
reasonably believe that from now 



until the harvesting ship returned, 
recorders would watch her day and 
night so the Nefertiti government 
could be assured of the legality of 
this operation. Taking a deep 
breath, she addressed the air. 

“My name is Kynance Foy! As 
a result of remarks made to me by 
Executive Shuster of the Zygra Com- 
pany I believe attempts will be made 
to infringe the contract of employ- 
ment I have entered into. I adduce 
the admitted fact that none of my 
nine immediate predecessors has 
completed this year of duty and col- 
lected his salary. Compare Stud- 
holme and Zacharias versus Perseus 
Asteroid Mining Company.” 

Merely saying that made her feel 
better. Let the Zygra Company be- 
ware! If she could leave nothing 
else behind her; if they did in 
fact murder her; at least she might 
be remembered as a legal precedent. 
Sustained by that vicarious form of 
immortality, she set off on a sur- 
vey of her new domain. 

T he first thing to do was count 
the jaws of the trap. Her men- 
tal list of obvious pitfalls grew with 
dismaying speed. 

They were taking no chances, for 
instance, with injury or sickness. 
She had never seen the threshold of 
a medicare cabinet set so low. If 
she so much as slept the clock 
around she would find a snuffling 
servo making metabolic checks be- 
side the bed, and behind it the 
prosthetics responsible for the fic- 
tion of “continued human occupan- 
cy” of the planet. 

She narrowed her eyes, spotting 



36 



IF 




something half-shadowed at the back 
of the medicare unit which she 
didn’t think belonged. Before touch- 
ing anything, she spoke to the im- 
personal recorders. 

“I suspect a malfunction in the 
automatic equipment. ‘Inspection for 
the purpose of repair does not con- 
stitute sabotage* — Lyon et Marseil- 
le Freight Company versus Adolphe 
ben Hossein!” 

When she finally did discover the 
purpose of the- addition to the me- 
dicare unit, she shook with fury. 
It was a self-fatiguing resonator 
plate on the piping from the plasma 
store to the prosthetics. She suspect- 
ed it would resonate to the frequen- 
cies generated as Zygra One boomed 
down to land on the station’s deck. 
Broken, it would admit air to the 
pipe. End of supervisor — and the 
fractured plate would have been re- 
placed automatically before the star- 
ship’s crew emerged to find the 
body! 

TTiere was something friendishly 
subtle about a trap so simple yet 
so nearly infallible. How could she 
hope to match the devious minds 
which had conceived it? 

Yet as she proceeded with her 
survey, her spirits lightened anew. 
The company’s planners had them- 
selves been victims of circumstance. 
Developing new planets at high pres- 
sure led to a particular attitude of 
mind. The ideal aimed at was “turn 
her on and let her run*’, and the 
more successful the outworiders had 
grown at high reliability, the less 
they had worried about improve- 
ments. 

They had been too busy apply- 



ing what they already knew to un- 
dertake orig^al research. Inspired 
corner-cutting, which they were 
brilliant at, was no substitute for 
Earthside-style testing. Earth had 
the manpower to waste on a one per 
cent improvement in energy con- 
sumption — even on change for 
change’s sake. Consequently Ky- 
nance was struck by an aura of 
obsolescence. This w^ the largest 
automated system in the known 
galaxy; for precisely that reason it 
incorporated only tried and true de- 
vices. 

Kynancc made what comparisons 
she could to fix this fact in her 
mind. Suppose, two centuries pre- 
vious, it had been necessary to build 
a transport system across an African 
desert. There would have been 
hovercraft, monorails, nuclear reac- 
tors, linear induction motors — 
scores of choices open. But the de- 
cision would almost certainly have 
been for diesel locomotives hauling 
trains on rails already familiar for a 
hundred and fifty years. In other 
words, the automatics controlling 
Zygra were to faster-than-light star- 
ships as a railroad to a nuclear 
power station. 

Which left her in the situation of 
someone trying to stop a diesel loco- 
motive with sheer ingenuity: a tough 
problem, but not insoluble. 

Self-preservation came first, 
though. Even the simplest of her 
tasks — rigging remote extensions 
for the central alarm — was tricky. 
She could say to the recording ma- 
chines, “The alarms are inadequate 
to comply with the conditions of 
employment! Von Hagen and Mar- 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH

chetti versus Ice V Construction 
Company of Titan: ‘The experience 
of employees in the field carrier 
more weight than predictions by 
computers’.” 

But she couldn’t make a qua- 
space signal relay out of Zygran 
wood and old plastic food-boxes. 

S he jury-rigged the alarm switches. 

Then she tackled the self-fati- 
guing plate on the medicare cabinet, 
and established that the station’s 
computers were indeed primed with 
legal information. The moment she 
touched the plasma pipe, warnings 
dinned into her ears. She waited, 
quoted Lyon et Marseille versus Hos- 
sein again, and tried a second ap- 
proach. This time the computer 
didn’t object. 

Splendid! How about Yukinawa, 
dos Passos and Szerelmy versus Ge 
Nuclear Fusion Monopoly? “Modifi- 
cations to automatic machinery 
which improve its function without 
detriment to the purposes of the 
proprietor do not constitute grounds 
for voiding a contract of employ- 
ment!” she recited. 

She fancied she detected an un- 
happy grinding sound below the 
deck. A grim smile flitted over her 
face. Satisfied, she turned to the 
other automatics. 

The solar tide which had drawn 
the pelts to their rendezvous with 
the harvesting ship was subsiding. 
She jcould investigate the main sta- 
tion at leisure, but the herding 
monitors, the coating-station and 
everything else would shortl / be hull- 
down over the horizon as the pelts 
scattered again. 



She toured the entire establish- 
ment, clinging to the slippery back 
of a monitor when possible, swim- 
ming the rest of the way. 

In the coating-station — which 
stank like a glue-factory from the 
vats of gummy organic jelly it was 
cooking up to apply to full-grown 
pelts — she found the same aura 
of obsolescence as everywhere else. 
She had never studied organic 
chemistry seriously, but before the 
boy who mocked her for not being 
able to fix her skycar,' there had 
been another who was insufferably 
proud of his ability in the garden, 
and she had mugged up enough 
horticulture to wipe the grin off his 
face. She was sure any competent 
Earthside organochemist could have 
increased the efficiency of the coat- 
ing-station by fifty per cent. 

“That cuts the company down to 
size!” she told the air as she swam 
back to the main station. “I must 
stop thinking of it as a bunch of 
infinitely clever villains, and regard 
it as an irritable dinosaur, big but 
stupid!” 

With pools of water dripping from 
her clothes, she looked out over the 
landing-deck. All it would take to 
save her from infringing her con- 
tract was a mixture of caution and 
dirty-minded suspiciousness. Once 
that was settled, she could let her- 
self relax. 

She turned slowly through a com- 
plete circle, a hint of awe coloring 
her thoughts as she at last drank in 
what it meant to be in charge of a 
whole planet almost the size of 
Earth. 

And froze, staring at something 



38 



IF 




impossible, intolerable. In letters of 
fire a clause from her contract 
blazed across her vision: a clause 
she had thought there was no risk 
of breaking, but which she realized 
in this instant she must break — if 
she wanted to keep company with 
herself for the rest of her life. 

At least she could stop herself 
from waving. But all that could do 
was postpone the reckoning. She 
was already doomed. 

IX 

C C ''T^he bastard’s made us too 
A late!” moaned Victor. 

He meant the miserable Dickery 
Evan, whose weight made their 
clumsy boat even more difficult to 
force through the water. Coberley 
rounded on him. 

“Maybe you could have left him 
to die out there,” he thundered. 
“But I couldn’t! And what do you 
mean — he made us too late? \^o 
navigated us into that mudbank, 
hey?” 

Horst winced, remembering the 
loathsome suck of the mud as they 
struggled to get the craft afloat 
again. They had still been trying to 
find clear water when they heard 
the knelt of the starship taking off. 

“It wasn’t my fault!” Victor 
screamed. “I wasn’t in the bow look- 
ing out for shoals!” 

Horst caught Coberley’s eye. “No 
good arguing, ”he muttered. “He’s in 
his down -phase. We’re lucky he 
stayed on the upswing long enough 
to bring us close to where he want 
to get.” 

It was slim comfort. Victor’s 



cycles of dear thinking alternated 
with periods of non-communication 
lasting for days. He ought never to 
have come to Zygra. The isolation 
had broken him completely. 

Ought any of us to have come 
here? 

And now this last absurd gamble. 
What a plot to be hatched by four 
naked men, one insane, one driven 
by hate and one crippled with a 
broken arm! As to the fourth . 

He shook his head violently. He 
dared not wonder if he himself was 
still mentally normal. 

Mechanically paddling, he stared 
at the prospect ahead. The tide here 
had deepened the water to maxi- 
mum. Curiously abbreviated, the 
stems of the longest bottom-plants 
swayed against their own reflec- 
tions: mud-sequoias, aquatic arbutus, 
mock-magnolia — heavy, these 
last, with blossoms unconnected with 
their own life-cycle, being aerophy- 
tes more akin to orchids than any- 
think else familiar to humans. 
There was no animal life, so flower- 
ers to attract insects were irrele- 
vant; the oxygen-cycle was closed by 
putrefying bacteria, not animal 
lungs. 

Thinking about tiic flowers dc 
pressed him. Had he and his con" 
panions not also become parasite^ 
on the lush but drab vegetation? He 
forced himself to concentrate on 
their plan and comdnee himself it 
was feasible. 

If only Solomon were still alive! 

Y ears ago, somebody he’d heard 
of from Victor and Coberley 
had been foolish enough to think 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



39 




the company would take pity on a 
stranded employee. He’d hung 
around until the starship landed, 
then shown himself — and had 
been shot down, on the pretext he’d 
been mistaken for a pirate or a 
wild beast. 

On a world without animals! 

The moral was: keep clear of the 
annual visitors. Devious ways were 
tried of getting a message out, in- 
stead. One year there had been 
an attempt to hide a message in a 
pelt-crate. The station smashed the 
man’s legs with an automatic pack- 
ing-press. Another year, hiding mes- 
sages in actual pelts had been tried; 
nothing came of that, though no 
lives were lost. Another year — 

Oh, it wasn’t important. Time had 
passed. The company had ignored 
the castaways on Zygra, and would 
do so until they became a nuisance. 
Sabotaging the pelt-crop was impos- 
sible, with a monitor accompanying 
every herd; approaching the main 
station seemed tantamount to suicide 
. Then Solomon joined them, 
and they devised the notion of seiz- 
ing and smashing a monitor so that 
its parent station would have to ship 
it back to the main station for an 
overhaul, carrying a man hidden in 
its pelt-compartment. Solomon had 
died trying it. 

Enough. Now was the time to 
gamble everything. Death would be 
better than this vegetable half-life! 

At the very start, Horst had told 
Coberley they ought to make an 
open approach to the new supervi- 
sor — to which Coberley replied: 
“Suppose Victor and I had asked 
you for help?” 



And Horst had shut his mouth 
on a vomit-like rising of self-disgust. 
He had been desperate to serve out 
his time and collect his pay. There 
had been a girl . 

Lost forever. Probably thinks Vm 
dead. But wouldn*t have made in- 
quiries to find out. 

He was coming to feel that hu- 
manity was horrible, glamorous on 
the outside, within stinking and 
rotten. 

So now: the double-or-nothing 

throw. Approach the ‘ station, risk 
being spotted by the new supervisor; 
either invoke his help, or overpower 
him; set about wrecking the auto- 
matics so thoroughly the company 
would have to send an unscheduled 
ship, and hope to excite interest at 
government level which might save 
them simply being killed off as 
saboteurs. A thin chance, but all 
they had. 

Horst felt it might work. Unless 
something more blatant had been in- 
stalled since he last saw the main 
station, the Nefertitian government 
hadn’t winked at weapons like com- 
puter-operated laser guns. 

His mind was so far away he 
didn’t hear Coberley’s order to stop 
paddling. It took a back-handed slap 
to bring him back. 

Dazed, he stared over the water 
There was the coating-station, get- 
ting up power to go hunt weeds; the 
substations and monitors in a sea 
of unripe pelts; the main station, 
and on its deck — 

“A woman,” Horst said softly. 

“What?” Coberley rasped. 

“My eyes aren’t that bad. It’s a 
woman!” 



40 



IF 




But Coberley wasn’t listening. He 
was trying to stop Victor waving at 
the new supervisor. “Get your head 
down! We want the raft to look 
like a piece of flotsam, not — ” 

“He-elp!” Dickery Evan ignored 
him, flinging his good arm in the 
air. “He-e-elp!” 

Why shouldn’t a woman be as 
callous as a man? She’d know as 
well as they that even to wave back 
was to forfeit her pay. Yet Horst 
was waving too now, and shouting, 
and after a moment of silent fury 
even Coberley did the same. 

X 

XTothing in the galaxy, Kynance 
realized sickly, could prevent 
her giving assistance to the men 
on their makeshift boat. So within 
a couple of days of starting her 
tour, she could kiss her chance of 
repatriation good-by. 

They must be what Shuster had 
calTed “previous incumbents”, left 
to live or die as the planet let 
them. TTieir arrival proved one 
thing: the company’s insistence that 
Zygra was uninhabitable without 
million-credit equipment was a lie. 

People capable of wresting a liv- 
ing from, this boundless marshland 
must be of remarkable determina- 
tion. They didn’t deserve to be aban- 
doned to fate. She clenched her fists 
and turned towards the observation 
dome, careful not to indicate she 
had noticed them. If her contract 
was going to be voided the moment 
must be delayed while she took 
some precautions. 

Her mind raced. The men would 



need food, showers, clothing, medi- 
cal attention — so she had to iso- 
late the autochef, the domestic ser- 
vices and the medicare unit from 
the central computers . Geoffrey 
Kotilal versus Astronaut Ambulance 
Company! Where an ambulance pilot 
en route to a disaster already at- 
tended by rival firms declined to 
rescue a lone pilot who lacked a 
guarantee of payment, and was held 
negligent because “the duty to save 
life in space is paramount above re- 
muneration”. 

It specified in space. But — 

She whistled. It had been ruled 
in McGillicuddy and Kropotkin ver- 
sus Callisto Methane Derivatives 
that “space” included any solid body 
not possessed of independent juris- 
diction. As of the moment she broke 
her contract, the whole planet Zygra 
would count as an asteroid. 

In which case . 

A sort of drunkenness made her 
sway. There was no time to examine 
her crazy notion in detail. She would 
just have to trust her memory. 
Feverishly she attacked the devices 
she was likdy to need. She couldn’t 
think of any better excuse than the 
standard one of “suspected malfunc- 
tion”, but the computer didn’t argue 
until the greater part of the job was 
finished. Then it slammed the front 
of the master monitor unit and re- 
ported ignorance of any fault in that 
system. 

Kynance bit her lip. Well, never 
mind; the only other essential device 
to isolate before that ridiculous blad- 
der-and-stick boat came bobbing up 
was the main circuit-restorer. That 
would prevent the computers from

rec.^ining control of the units she 
had disconnected. 

Her task finished, she ran back 
to the observation dome and emer- 
ged into sight of the four naked 
men. She waved, and hallooed, and 
invited them aboard. 

Instantly the doom-laden mechani- 
cal call rang out. 

“You have signaled to a person 
not employed by the Zygra Com- 
pany. Accordingly your contract is 
void.” 

4 4^^h, cosmos!” Coberley breath- 
ed in a despairing whisper. 

“Keep paddling,” Horst told him. 
“She’s grinning so wide I can see 
it from here!” 

“Come on! It’s all right!” Simply 
letting things happen without won- 
dering about explanations, Horst and 
his companions closed the last gap. 
The woman reached down to help 
them. Victor insisted on pushing for- 
ward first, and went on a crazy run 
around the entire deck, head bob- 
bing like a chicken’s, crowing with 
delight and disbelief. 

They lifted and dragged the in- 
jured Evan aboard; Coberley fol- 
lowed, and last of all Horst. The 
steel underfoot seemed to magnify 
his weight. He could barely stand 
and look at their savior and try to 
recognize that she was worth look- 
ing at: petite, fine-featured, with 
strange iron-colored hair. 

All he could find to say was an 
inane question: “You’ve broken 

your contract — what are you going 
to do?” 

“It isn’t the end of the universe,” 
the girl said, trembling with what 



Horst could only think of as sup- 
pressed glee. “I take it you’re some 
of the nine of my predecessors who 
failed to complete a full tour?” 
“That’s right,” Horst agreed. “I’m 
Horst Lampeter . Giuseppe 
Coberley . Dickery Evan . and 
Victor Sjoberg is the one going 
round and round the deck.” 

“I’m Kynance Foy,” the girl said. 
“From Earth.” 

“And you’ve given up your 
chance of repatriation?” 

“Did you expect me to leave you 
to rot? When I could offer you 
proper food, medical attention, a hot 
shower, even — ” she glanced at his 
bare body with engaging frankness 
— “clothes?” 

“But the automatics won’t obey 
you any longer!” Coberley exclaim- 
ed. 

“It just so happens I’m rather par- 
ticular about automatics supposed 
to look after me. And at the mo- 
ment when I — ah — broke my 
contract, rather a lot of them were 
disconnected for inspection. I don’t 
suppose it will be difficult to con- 
vert them to manual operation.” 
“But supervisors are forbidden to 
touch the automatics!” That was 
Dickery Evan, raising his broken 
arm in witness to his statement. 

“Not exactly. Not even the Zygra 
Company can rewrite galactic legal 
precedent to suit its own conven- 
ience. The only thing I’ve done 
which did entitle them to fire me 
was to wave at you, and that might 
not stand up long in court. How- 
ever, before we get it to court we 
have you to attend to. So stop argu- 
ing and come along!”

XI 

W ithin the hour, Horst’s be- 
wilderment had given way to 
awe. In the dragging years since he 
was dismissed for trying to rewire a 
faulty book-projector classed as 
“crucial equipment” his memory of 
the main station had been distorted 
into a vision of hell. Indeed, it had 
been a gigantic trap for him. 

Not for this astonishing young 
woman, though. Evan’s arm was 
comfortable in a proper healing- 
sheath; vitamins, proteins and space 
knew what had streamed into Vic- 
tor’s knobbled veins, and now he 
lay snoozing on the supervisor’s 
bunk, and Horst, Evan and Cober- 
ley were clean, dressed and putting 
away platters of unbelievable food. 

Coberly tucked right in. Horst, 
though, found himself staring at Ky- 
nance and eating by touch alone. 

“You’re an extraordinary person!” 
he burst out. 

“You’re the ones who are aston- 
ishing,” she parried. “To survive out 
there without help, or resources, or 
even terrestrial food.” 

“But if I’d done some of the 
things you’ve done, like bringing the 
automatics under manual control. 
I’d have expected to be tossed aside 
like Dickery here on a weed-mat!” 
“He must have done something 
worst than just interfering with some 
of the automatics, then,” Kynance 
said. 

“I guess I did,” Dickery confessed 
sullenly, and explained. 

“If you hadn’t done that,” Ky- 
nance murmured, “you could have 
stayed here indefinitely. A person 



in distress, especially someone in- 
danger of his life, commits no crime 
if he helps himself to someone 
else’s property to sustain himself.” 

“Fat lot of good telling me now,” 
Evan answered. 

Checking a gobbet of food on the 
way to his mouth, Coberley demand- 
ed, “You mean I could have stuck 
around and taken whatever I want- 
ed?” 

“Food, drink and medical sup- 
plies, at least.” 

“TTie hell you say. Well, it 
wouldn’t have done me much good. 
Like Dickery, I got crazy-mad at 
the company.” 

Kynance bit her lip. “It seems un- 
fair, after all you’ve been through, 
but I must say it. You walked into 
this with your eyes shut, and it was 
damned silly.” 

“Think we don’t realize that*?” 
Horst exclaimed. “I’ve kicked my- 
self twice around the planet! I got 
into this because it looked like a 
short cut to getting a girl I wanted, 

I was no prize and I thought I 
could make myself into one. I’ve 
been a fool all my life, skipping 
from one course of study to an- 
other till I’d wound up without a de- 
gree in anything, so I volunteered 
for Zygra against the advice of 
what few friends I had . .” 

“A bit of a romantic? hm?” Kv- 
nance suggested. “The out- worlds 
aren’t kind to romantics, as I’ve re- 
cently learned.” 

“Call trying to buy a girl with a 
year of your life ‘romantic’?” Cober- 
ley jeered. 

“What I had in mind,” Kynance 
corrected, “was skipping from sub-

ject to subject instead of fitting him- 
self into the right mold for Nefertiti. 
It’s one of the things Fve missed 
most on the outworlds: people who 
like to associate with people, spend 
time chatting idly, instead of driv- 
ing themselves around the clock. Fd 
worked out that some of the volun- 
teers for Zygra must be like you, be- 
cause there’s so little room for such 
people anywhere off Earth.” 

“I often thought Fd like to go to 
Earth,” Horst admitted. “I never 
made any real friends at home. 
Everybody on the planet seemed so 
tied up with making a career, earn- 
ing a fortune, while to me it simply 
didn’t seem enough to give purpose 
to a man’s life.” 

“He’s gone on like this ever 
since I first knew him,” Coberley 
scoffed. 

“What induced you to come to 
Zygra?” Kynance inquired. 

6CT was stupid, same as the oth- 

jL ers. Wouldn’t think it to look 
at me now, but when I was Horst’s 
age I had muscles, and there was a 
big demand for men who were built, 
back on Loki, my home world. I 
didn’t have the brains to match, 
though, and got left behind by 
events. vSo I jumped at this.” 
“Dickery2” 

What he told her confirmed her 
guess: a nice guy, lazy, not bright 
enough to invest twenty years’ hard 
work against the promise of later en- 
joyment. Easy meat for the Zygra 
Company. So too was Victor, about 
whom the others reported that in 
a fit of depression he’d wanted to 
get the hell away from the human 



race. Of course, when his condition 
cycled back to the upward phase, 
he’d regretted it. 

“Do any of you know why the 
Zygra Company adopted the policy 
of changing supervisors annually and 
tricking them into infringing their 
contracts?” Kynance asked next. 

“Fve heard the story from Vic- 
tor,” Horst answered. “A man call- 
ed Zbygniewski was armored up to 
the roof of his skull with posthyp- 
notics and planted by a rival com- 
pany among the regular staff, back 
in the days when the job was farm- 
ed out among permanent employees. 
He got away with information that 
enabled his bosses to mount the most 
nearly successful of all the raids on 
Zygra. Also he planted a boobytrap 
for his successor, the idea being to 
make the planet legally unoccupied 
before the harvesting ship came.” 

He broke off. Something in Ky- 
nance’s expression had given him a 
clue to what she was thinking, but 
she gave him a wink and raised her 
hand. 

“This boobytrap, then, started the 
company on its present course? 
Tricking the supervisors, I mean.” 
“I gather it was Shuster’s idea, 
the thing that advanced him to exe- 
cutive status,” Horst said. 

“That fits. You’d expect a swine 
like him to have done something ex- 
ceptionally dirty to get ahead. Now: 
please tell me how each of you was 
inveigled into breaking his contract.” 
Horst wondered if some of the 
means employed would prove to be 
illegal, but Kynance dashed that 
hope. To Evan she said, “Tamper- 
ing with that record did constitute

sabotage — Levi Rico versus Free 
Space Haulage Company, 2153.” 
And to Horst: “That book pro- 
jector might have been used to give 
you instructions, and legally you 
weren’t entitled to do anything which 
risked garbling vital information.” 
And to Coberley, who had tried 
to re-set the autochef when it burned 
his breakfast: “The computer was 
bound to consider the chance you 
might alter a settting far enough to 
poison yourself — Fernando Du- 
quesne versus the Osceola Food 
Company, 2099, is clear on that.” 
“All right, since you’re so smart,” 
Coberley spat, “tell us what we can 
do to get off this stinking mudball!” 
“Coberley, pipe down!” Horst 
rapped. “This girl has done things 
you and I wouldn’t have had the 
guts to try even if we’d thought of 
them.” 

“I’ve done nothing special,” Ky- 
nance said. “Only it does strike me 
you outworlders are too used to re- 
lying on machines. It’s natural. 
You’ve done miracles with automa- 
tic systems which were never needed 
on Earth. When your life depends 
on them, you don’t interfere with 
their operations. The moment I 
caught sight of you paddling your 
boat, I realized I’d fallen into the 
trap the Zygra Company sets for its 
supervisors: the lie that the planet 
is impossible to inhabit without mil- 
lion-credit life-support equipment.” 
“So when you sacrificed your 
contract, you did have a plan in 
view,” Horst said. 

“If it’s not a plan to get us out 
of here I’m not interested,” snapped 
Coberley. 



“It may come to that,” Kynance 
told him. “At best it involves a de- 
lay of a Zygran year, but there arc 
a lot of compensations which will 
more than make up for it.” 

Dickery sat up and began to take 
notice, and she unfolded to them the 
fantastic scheme which had come 
to her in a flash of inspiration. 

XII 

T he irony of it all was the way it 
turned on little piVots of time, 
separated by enormous gulfs of 
months or years when they did 
nothing but wait for the future to 
catch up with them. 

If, for example, the four men had 
been a couple of days later in reach- 
ing the main station, her plan would 
have been impossible to implement. 
Now the risk lay in being even one 
second too early; they had to wait 
for an arbitrary deadline, where- 
upon they would have to cram into 
a few narrow hours the fruit of 
months of plotting. And it might 
all go for nothing in the end. 

They were assembled in the ob- 
servation dome, where they had 
rigged a remote for the calendar 
clock in the supervisor’s quarters. 
The hands were ticking toward the 
red line she had inscribed across 
the face first thing today. One by 
one they had fallen silent; the chat- 
tering that had signaled the release 
of old tension, now the day of their 
revenge was upon them, hadn’t 
lasted. 

'"Can't we?” Dickery suggested, 
and closed his hand on the cai of 
paint beside him. 



46 



IF 




“No!” Horst rasped. “Kynance 
has explained over and over — 
this has got to be watertight!” 

“I don’t know how much longer 
I can bear to wait,” Victor com- 
plained. But he had been saying the 
same thing daily for half a year 
past, and they ignored it as a for- 
mality. 

At first, Kynance had scarcely ex- 
pected to survive to this moment. 
The strain of knowing that yet one 
more year must leak away had caus- 
ed three fights between Evan and 
Coberly, and one between Evan 
and Horst. But that had stopped 
as they began to accept the conse- 
quences of their joint action. 

She had first let herself believe in 
success the day she came upon Co- 
berley — of all the men — staring 
at the white sunlight on the pools of 
water pitting the mudflats, at the 
matted vegetation, at the drab olive- 
dun shapes of unripe pelts drifting 
ahead of their monitor. 

He’d turned, and scowled, and 
said, “Damned bastards in the Zy- 
gra Company — trying to make out 
this isn’t a fit world for human be- 
ings!” 

After that, the tone of their dis- 
cussions altered from desperate to 
proud.. What a bunch of misfits! 
Kynance thought, then added with 
a burst of near-affection: Yet there's 
something special about anyone 
who'll accept the responsibility of 
looking after a whole planet! 

“Kynance!” Horst said, and she 
started. While she was wrapped in 
thought, the clock had reached the 
red line. 

She took a deep breath and began 



to recite the necessary legal formu- 
lae. They seemed to take half 
eternity. Finally she ran out of 
words and breath at the same time. 
She could only give a nod to her 
companions, and they shot away. 

With paint, with circuit-tracers, 
with meters and gauges and sheets 
of paper on which compnjter pro- 
grams had been fair-copied after a 
dozen revisions, they set out to con- 
quer Zygra. 

T he boom of the starship reached 
them just as the job was finish- 
ed. Dickery, paint on face and hands, 
was the last to join them in the 
observation dome, and they grinned 
and slapped each other on the back 
before turning to go watch the ship 
make its landing. 

The impact of Dickery’s work was 
all that could be hoped for. A head 
appeared from the bridge compart- 
ment. It turned to survey the sta- 
tion, and was confronted with let- 
ters a meter high running along 
the side of the observation dome. 

They said ZYGRA MAIN 
SPACEPORT. 

Another head appeared. There 
was some shouting. A third head 
peered out — by the glitter on the 
attached shoulders, it belonged to 
the captain. And then Shuster ap- 
peared. 

“Right,” Kynance said grimly. 
“Time to go and welcome them, I 
think!” 

Horst blurted out, “Kynance, 
you’re remarkable!” 

“Just as well,” Victor said. “The 
galaxy would fall apart if there were 
many more like her.” 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



47 




Ky nance flushed, gathered up the 
folder of documents she had prepar- 
ed, and led the way on to the deck. 
They waved to the astonished crew- 
men leaning out of the bridge. 

Another couple of minutes, and 
the nearest lock shot open to dis- 
gorge Shuster and several others, in- 
cluding the second mate who had 
tried to remonstrate when Kynance 
showed up to join the ship on Nefer- 
titi. They were armed with laser- 
guns, and Kynance had to force her- 
self to stand fast. 

But she had rehearsed this mo- 
ment mentally so many times that 
the necessary words sprang to her 
lips. “Which of you is the senior 
representative of the company oper- 
ating this vessel? You have not 
signified acceptance of the harbor 
dues in force at this port, and you 
are required to furnish proof of abili- 
ty to meet them before discharging 
or loading cargo.” 

Shuster had gone white as a 
comet’s tail with the shock of being 
confronted with five people he had 
given up for dead. He pulled the 
rags of his self-possession together. 

“What is all this nonsense?” he 
blustered. 

At least he’d realized he couldn’t 
just order them burned down where 
they stood. Kynance said, “Are you 
the senior company official, then?” 

“You know damned well I am!” 
Shuster roared. “And I want to be 
told the meaning of this slogan 
you’v^ scrawled on my company’s 
main station!” 

“Not yours,” Kynance said deli- 
cately. 

The second mate lowered his gun. 



With worried glances at Shuster the 
others copied him. 

Ignoring Shuster’s raging, Ky- 
nance addressed the men leaning out 
of the bridge. “Is there a recorder 
up there?” 

A hasty whispered conference, and 
then a defiant assurance that every- 
thing was being recorded. “So that 
you damned pirates will get what’s 
coming to you!” 

“If there is any piracy going on 
around here, it looks as though it’s 
on your side, landing ‘a party of 
armed men at this spaceport!” 

“Spaceport!” Shuster shouted. 
“This is the Zygra Company’s main 
station!” 

“Correction,” Kynance informed 
him. “This is Zygra Main Spaceport, 
under the control and direction of 
the Zygra Port Operations Company 
— keep that recorder pointed at 
me!” she added in a sudden bellow 
the force of which amazed her. “I 
want the whole story down for any 
action that may be needed!” 

The snout of the recorder waver- 
ed, but remained trained. 

“My name is Kynance Foy. I was 
engaged to act as supervisor of Zy- 
gra on behalf of the Zygra Com- 
pany, to conform with the legal re- 
quirement that a celestial body to 
which a claim is laid must be oc- 
cupied by at least one living per- 
son. My contract forbade me to 
communicate with anyone not em- 
ployed by the company. 

“Within two days of arriving 1 
was approached by four ex-incum- 
bents of the same post, who had 
been inveigled into breaking their 
contracts — ” 



48 



IF 




“It’s a lie!’’ Shuster screamed. 
Kyoance disregarded him. 

“On speaking to them, I auto- 
matically ceased to be an employee 
of the company. Since that moment, 
the planet Zygra has reverted to the 
status of an unclaimed celestial 
body," 

“Oh, cosmos,” said the second 
mate in a barely audible voice. 

“But you can’t claim Zygra,” 
Shuster began. 

“I can,” Kynance answered de- 
murely, and wondered when he 
would begin to squirm. 

C4ir)ut just a second!” Grasping 
at a straw, Shuster stumbled 
over his own tongue. “That doesn’t 
apply to property — ” 

“You mean Zygra Main Port?” 
Kynance smiled. “Are you familiar 
with the law of salvage?” 

Shuster seemed to choke. 

“I think you understand me,” 
Kynance said. “Property cast away 
on an unclaimed celestial body is 
subject to reclamation as salvage and 
sale by the recoverer after one local 
or one Earthside year, whichever 
is the shorter. It so happens that 
the Zygran year is four days and 
five hours longer than an Earth- 
side year. 

“Approximately three hours ago 
this vessel — note, by whatever 
name you call it, it is legally a 
waterborne vessel, in other words a 
ship! — was reclaimed as salvage 
by the Zygra Salvage Company, who 
thereupon sold it to its present own- 
ers with warranty of title. If you 
wish to exercise a lapsed previous 
title you must purchase it at the 



current estimate of its value. Con- 
servatively I’d say it’s worth a thou- 
sand million credits. Wouldn’t you 
agree?” 

“Woman, you’re raving!” Shuster 
moaned. “Why, that’s half the value 
of our pelts for a year!” 

“Yowr pelts?” Kynance said soft- 
ly. “I’m sorry, but tins was an un- 
claimed celestial body — forgotten 
already? The pelts are the property 
of the Zygra Pelt Exporting Com- 
pany.” 

"What?" 

“They were purchased from the 
Zygra Pelt Raising Company about 
forty minutes ago. The Pelt Raising 
Company are the new owners of the 
substations, monitors and coating- 
station, which they purchased about 
two hours ago from the Zygra Sal- 
vage Company.” 

Shuster clamped both palms 
against his temples as though afraid 
his brain would burst his skull. 
“What are all these companies you 
keep talking about?” he whimpered. 

“Are you acquainted with the 
regulations governing the formation 
of a company to operate interstellar 
trade? I am. I studied interstellar 
commerce as a follow-up to my 
courses in business law.” 

“Oh,” Shuster said in a dead 
voice. 

“The moment you allowed five 
people loose on the surface of this 
planet,” Kynance told him, “you 
dug your own grave. The law states 
such a company requiries five of- 
ficers: president, chairman, manag- 
ing director, treasurer and secretary, 
of whom not fewer than three must 
be citizens of the planet where the

company is registered. Holding one 
office in any given company does 
not debar an individual from holding 
the same or another office in some 
other company. Correct?” 

Swaying a little on his feet» Shus- 
ter stared wildly at the group facing 
him, gulping enormous breaths. 

“Do you wish to inspect the docu- 
ments relating to the companies now 
operating on Zygra?” Kynance asked 
him formally. “That is to say — ” 
“But you can’t register a com- 
pany here!” Shuster shrieked. “A 
company has to be registered with a 
planetary government!” 

Kynance fused, dropped and ex- 
ploded her last and greatest bomb- 
shell. 

She said, “We are a government.” 

xni 

S huster was beyond speech. Giving 
him in a puzzled glance, the 
second mate bolstered his gun. He 
said, “I guess I don’t understand 
what’s gone on here.” 

Once, long ago, Kynance had had 
a dream involving a person- 
able young space officer. This man 
could have slotted quite neatly into 
the role. But that was so far in 
the past she felt the whole thing 
had happened to someone else. She 
only remeunbered how he and his 
fellows had shut their mouths when 
they must have known it was com- 
pany policy that no supervisor 
should return from Zygra. 

She said clearly, for the benefit 
of the records, “You must be either 
ignorant or stupid. Three conditions 
must be fulfilled before a planetary 



government can be set up. First, the 
planet must be fit for habitation — 
instanced by the fact that these four 
men have survived without artificial 
aids for years on end. Second, it 
must be free of any claim of abso- 
lute sovereignty previously register- 
ed by an empowered company — 
and we’ve been over that. Third, 
it must be occupied by members of 
both sexes. We comply in all re- 
spects. 

“One Earthside year, plus one 
minute, after the abandonment of 
Zygra by any employee of the com- 
pany formerly recognized as so- 
vereign here, we became eligible to 
declare ourselves the legal govern- 
ment, and we did so. Our President, 
Horst Lampeter!” 

Horst stepped forward, eyes a lit- 
tle narrowed against the sun, and 
scowled at Shuster. 

“Our Minister of Planetside Af- 
fairs: Dickery Evan!” 

Dickery swaggered up beside 
Horst. 

“Our Minister of Trade and Fi- 
nance!” 

Victor joined the row, and 
Kynance fell in at his right. “I 
myself,” she said, “am serving in 
the capacity of Minister of External 
Affairs, and our Minister of Justice 
is — ” 

She gestured. Coberley tramped 
forward. This past year his fat had 
melted off him, letting hard muscle 
show through, and he hunched 
threateningly as he approached Shus- 
ter, arms swinging as though pre- 
pared to pick the smaller man up 
bodily and hurl him overside to 
drown among the gorgeous pelts. 



50 



IF 




In that instant taut with menace, 
Shuster must have seen a vision of 
what fate had in store. Beyond the 
mere financial collapse of the Zygra 
Company loomed other terrors. 
Once it was shown he had deliber- 
ately tricked the supervisors and ab- 
andoned them to their fate, no gov- 
ernment in the galaxy could refrain 
from ordering the payment of dam- 
ages to those who suffered or their 
relatives. Kynance had done some 
calculations: assuming the fines were 
levied as a percentage of assets — 
the usual practice — and the damages 
as a percentage of the balance, she 
estimated the company would have 
to sell its unsold stock, its interstellar 
freighters and even its headquarters 
building in order to pay its other 
employees their month’s salary in 
lieu of notice. 

A very satisfactory outcome. 

As she explained this to him, 
Shuster put both hands over his face 
and began to cry 

44T)ut doesn’t this mean you’re 

A) going to have to stay here 
indefinitely?” suggested the second 
mate. Overhead, some sort of argu- 
ment could be heard. Let them ar- 
gue, thought Kynance. 

“It sounds as if you’ve swallowed 
your company propaganda about it 
requiring millions of credits* worth 
of gear to keep a man alive on Zy- 
gra,” she said. “Bunkum! It’s pos- 
sible to live off the native vegeta- 
tion. How else do you think my 
friends managed?” 

“But in that case — ” the mate be- 
gan. 

“In that case, Zygra is a greater 



prize than Loki, or Ge, or a score 
of other planets that could only be 
made habitable by importing Earth- 
side plants, animals and bacteria. 
We’re wide open for immigration. 
Or we shall be, as soon as we’ve dis- 
posed of our first crop of pelts.**/ 

“How are you going to do that?” 
demanded the mate. “You. don’t own 
any ships.” 

“No,” Kynance admitted. “But 
you haven’t seen the scale of port 
charges currently in force. For a 
ship of this size they amount to — 
Victor?” 

“A hundred million credits per 
local day,” Victor said. 

“What?” The mate and his com- 
panions spoke as one. 

“Well, any underdeveloped planet 
needs to exploit its resources,” Ky- 
nance said. “And currently we only 
have the pelts. Mark you, the rate 
applicable to ships under charter lo 
the government of Zygra is substan- 
tially lower, and we’re extremely in- 
terested in chartering a few vessels 
on a profit-sharing basis.” 

“Do you mean shared among the 
crewT* 

“It’s a scheme we’ve worked out 
in some detail,” Victor said judi- 
ciously. “If you’re interested . .?” 

Interested was an understatement. 
Kynance’s experience had shown be- 
yond doubt that these men were 
greedy. A share in the most profit- 
able cargoes in the galaxy had 
looked like a quick route to their 
loyalty, and it was working like 
magic. 

“Here’s the captain, I see,” she 
murmured. “I wonder how he’ll feel 
about chartering the ship to us.” 



THE LONG WAY TO EARTH 



SI 




Patiently, citing authority after 
authority with the assurance due to 
an Earth year of milking the data 
banks of the main computer here, 
Kynance showed how it could be 
done. 

Philpot-Soames and Honegger ver- 
sus Transit Company of Loki: it was 
illegal to transport cargo without 
permission from the owner. The Zy- 
gra Company owned nothing on 
Zygra; they had sent the ship to 
bring away someone else’s property, 
and this was piracy within the 
meaning of Balewa and Chatterji 
versus Earth-Luna Shuttle Corpora- 
tion. No company — vide Olaf Gun- 
arson versus Phobos Metals — could 
compel employees to engage in il- 
legal undertakings; hence the captain 
and crew were free to accept work 
with any other employer .... 

And so forth, and so forth. When 
she had finished, Kynance was in a 
state like a walking dream. But she 
knew she had done it. 

T he renamed vessel Kynance Foy 
dwindled towards the shredded 
clouds. Victor, Coberley and Evan 
were somewhere below, celebrating 
their elevation to ministerial rank 
with the help of some wine bought 
on credit from the ship’s stores, but 
Kynance wanted to wait a while be- 
fore joining them. She stood watch- 
ing her namesake the ship head for 
the stars. 

Abruptly she became aware that 
Horst was watching too — not the 
ship, but her. 

He said, “I told you you were ex- 
traordinary. I’ve just realized the 
most extraordinary thing of all. Even 



after a year none of us know any- 
thing about you. We’re all afraid of 
you. You seem like a machine full 
of miracles!” 

“I had to be, didn’t I?” said Ky- 
nance after a pause. 

“Yes.” 

“Well, I’ve hated it. And thank 
you for reminding me before I got 
into the habit for life!” She laughed. 

“I’ll tell you something I’ve never 
told anyone else,” she went on. 
“When I left Earth, I had a secret 
dream. I was going to come home 
wearing a zygra pelt and a blase ex- 
pression, to jolt the hell out of all 
my friends. By the time I ran into 
Shuster, I was ready to settle for a 
square meal and a ticket home, and 
I didn’t give a damn about zygra 
pelts. Now, if I go home, I shall be 
able to take a shipload of them!” 
“‘If you go home . .? Don’t 
you want to go back to Earth?” 

“It has its points. But — I’ve been 
on Earth, Horst. I don’t mind going 
back the long way around.” 

“I used to think Earth was the 
only place in the galaxy where I 
might fit in,” Horst muttered. “But 
that’s not true any longer. There’s a 
planet called Zygra where people 
like me can fit in. I wonder if they’ll 
realize that.” 

“I think so. I estimate — oh — half 
a year before the first applicants for 
immigration show themselves.” 

“I tell you one thing,” Horst 
smiled. “If you’re going to stop be- 
having like a machine and start act- 
ing like a girl, there had damned 
well better be some more women 
among those early immigrants!”

IP ♦ Short Story 



OULED NAIL 

by H. Fi HOLLIS 



What does a spacemen need after the 
solitude between the planets? Some 
Earthmen found the answer long agol 



I ran into GaMegher on his annual 
eccentric orbit through New 
York. He was tanned as red iron 
DPust. I laid a magnetic grapple to 
him, and we made a perfect dual 
landfall on mahogany and brass. The 
beer was black and the sawdust floor 
was a place, in Galeg’s phrase, 
“where a man can feel gravity.” 
Galeg had a couple of long pulls 
and so did I. It was a companionable 
silence, and I finally broke it. 

“I hear,” I said, “that men in the 
Mars trade are all being replaced by 
machines. It’s . said that after the 
market for their memoirs has been 
glutted, the rest will be condemned 
to ten years of telling only the 
truth, drinking water and staying on 
earth.” 

His blue eye looked at me around 
the beer stein’s horizon, and his rust- 
red right thumb came over to cover 
the microphonic button on my har- 
ness that beams to the tape recorder 



while he expressed himself on the 
subject of storitapers and their petty, 
unmanly endeavors. Then he un- 
covered the button, and for the ben- 
efit of the tape said, “Don’t you 
believe it. The machine was never 
made that could repiace Gahegher, 
or even match him.” 

“In some ways, you may be right,” 
I told him, waving the bankeep for 
two more, “but I understand the 
technicians . .” 

‘The technioks are nice boys,” 
said he, “but — oh, you did order, 
did you? — they have no more soul 
than the machines they love unnat- 
urally.” 

“ReaMy, you can’t dehumanize 
those great contributors to human 
efficiency and comfort. Why, the 
automatic rehabilitation machines 
that keep you rocket jockeys sane, 
for example . .” 

“Them things!” Galeg laughed 
saftirical'ly. “They produce clinical 



53 



material for the psycho internes at 
a steady rate, that’s all.” 

“Well,” I declared, “it’s been 
nice to cross orbits, but your poli- 
tical views are rather antediliuvian. 
I have to interview a plantation 
owner from the asteroids.” 

“Listen!” He shut off my jets with 
a glittering eye. “Don’t you wonder 
that I’m standing and not still in 
a hammock getting my weight 
back?” 

“Do you mean you’re fresh off 
your pipe?” I cried. “Man, come 
sit down! Your heart — ” 

“You’re breaking it. I’m not from 
deep space.” 

“Why, the kick from Mars can’t 
be done under thirteen weeks. And 
you can’t have been here more than 
a day without even a pip in my 
picture tube.” 

“That’s where you’re wrong. I’m 
not from a thirteen-week kick.” 

I studied him as nearly as I could 
without startling him. “Well,” I said, 
“if you’re going to try to run that 
old space-warp hokey by me again, 
I really miust be off. That plantation 
owner . 

“May his oxygen crystallize!” 
cried the old G in a voice that moved 
his orbit a foot. “If you’ve better 
things to do than listen to an old 
tube mate’s final exposure of the 
soullessness of tecks and the ulti- 
mate failure* of machines, be off,” 
And he hoisted his schooner to the 
old motto over Sprague’s back bar, a 
historic communique from the last 
pre-atomic war: “Sighted Tub. 

Drank Same.” 

“Man,” I said, as I herded him 
and a fresh one to a round table, 



“will you tell me how the hagan you 
can stand and walk like a Times 
Square barfly and you just off the 
Mars kick?” 

He drank deep, and wiped the 
foamy mustache from his face of 
rust before he smiled and said, “Fm 
not from the thirteen, I’m telling 
you. That’s the story. Are these 
waiters blind, do you think?” 

I arranged to keep fuel in the 
lines, and he laid the orbit I was 
waiting for : 

M aybe you remember when the 
technicks thought up the new 
de-bend routine, and maybe you 
don’t. I’m older than you, and I 
remember well when a kick tube 
was a pipe to bum fuel in and that’s 
all. You sealed yourself in and threw 
her into deep space and hoped the 
calculators had figured you rigjht. 
There’ll never be a tube built big 
enough to carry enough fuel to nm 
with the flame lit from one world 
to another. And if there was,, you 
couldn’t kick her off a planet. So 
you burn the pipe just long enough 
to take advantage of the tide of 
gravity, and that’s all. 

It gets almighty lonesome, and a 
man comes kind of unstuck while 
he’s loose out there. He gets to feel 
like a grain of dust in a sunbeam 
after a while, with about as much 
chance of falling onto earth as the 
dust has of falling on a particular 
tabletop. 

Of course, men are tough. No- 
body’s ever been able to figure a 
man’s outside load. As much as can 
be piled on, there’s always some fel- 
low to take it and be ready for more. 



54 



IF 




Buft the toughest man has trouble 
getting back has planet legs after 
being in free fall through the solar 
system, and lots of pipe-pilots got 
a permanent separation of the seams 
that couldn’t be welded. That’s why 
the automatic rehaibs were designed. 

I had a partner — Pick Pratt. Not 
so much a partner, either, as a drink- 
ing and arguing mate. We kept dose 
tab on each other’s orbits, and when 
he kicked for earth, I was usually 
lighting the pipe a day or two later. 

I’d get into New York and find 
him stiff as a ramrod. 

As soon as I got him revived, I’d 
tie one on. When we slowed down 
enough that our lucid intervals coin- 
cided, we’d argue. About women. 
About war. About the long kick, 
mostly, and whether fifty thousand 
jets in the bank for each one was 
worth it — especially when it took 
pretty near the bank account in 
hooch to wipe out the memory of 
the trip. 

And we didn’t drink expensive 
either. Both of us were young and 
strong, and fusel oil with red pepper 
in it was what we craved: something 
to short out the main control board 
in a hurry. The worst of it was a 
kind of floating sensation that would 
come over a man in the street. He’d 
get to feeling he was going to float 
off the earth and drift for the aster- 
oids — no synthetic oxygen out there 
then — and he couldn’t shake it off. 

Many’s the time I’ve had Pick hol- 
ler, “Grab my knees. I’m going!”' 
and you bet I grabbed ’em too, 
because if I didn’t, I knew he’d let 
me float off the next time I got 
light-fheaded. I’d siling him over my 



shoulder till we could get in a bar 
and get something heavy in his 
stomach. 

And women. O Lord, women! 

Seaman off a three-year cruise 
was nothing compared to us. No 
woman wanted us around. I mean, 
fifty thousand in the bank or not 
The Freudian psychos were as popu- 
lar then as these religious, ones are 
now; and they said — well, you 
wouldn’t believe it, and I don’t want 
to. Anyway, the women wouldn’t put 
up with it. No kind of women. Pretty 
soon a man was as lonesome here 
as in space. 

T>ick and I missed a kick once. I 
A got to floating and Pick got to 
weighing me down and it was a week 
after our turn to light off before we 
made it to the White Sands shuttle, 
and they wouldn’t even take us up 
to the space station. We were strand- 
ed in Texas. They ran us out of New 
Mexico. 

At first we were desperate. Then 
it got to seem like a good thing. 

The longer we were away from 
the long kick, the better we got to 
feeling. We even rode jeeps for a 
while for some old geezer in west 
Texas — automatic jeeps. After a 
while Pick found out how to take 
the automatic attachment off, and 
then it was real fun. He fixed up one 
of the attachments to follow deer 
instead of cattle. We really lived. 

There’s a big rare-earths deposit 
in that part of the world, and there’s 
a robotics factory out there. The 
whole town is automatic — saloons, 
movies and all. Pick said it gave 
him the creeps. 



OULED NAIL 



5B 




We had started in to get a stake, 
but after we got it, somehow we 
didn’t quit. Finally Pratt up and said 
he was fixed. He was never going 
back to the kick tubes. That kind of 
jarred me into realizing that I was 
restless, hungry to be in free fall 
again. You think I’m nuts? So did 
Picker, but I stuck to it, and we had 
a couple of fist fights about it, until 
we calmed down and decided to 
split up like men instead of kids. 

He was tired of riding jeep for the 
old man, but he said he’d look 
around till he found a job on the 
ground, and I hauled out for White 
Sands. We made it up to send a 
beam to Dome One on Mars once 
a year so we wouldn’t lose track. 

When I got to the Sands, some- 
body else had floated once too often, 
and I had a hot tail in a hurry. 
Mars was the long way that trip. 
Twenty-four weeks. Once or twice 
I got to wishing I was bumming 
around earth with Pick again, but 
as soon as I reeled Mars in and got 
a lungful of that skinny air, I forgot 
it. 

There was a lot of talk about 
built-in rehab units going around, 
and sure enough, the teoks tried one 
out on me. It was just a twenty-four 
hour wire loaded with jazz and other 
earth sounds, but it was about all 
the extra weight a pipe could push 
then — couldn’t leave a gram of that 
high Geiger cargo, you know. It 
broke or got a lashback or some- 
thing about three weeks into no 
grav, and I spent seventeen weeks — 
years, it seemed like — listening to 
“a mouth-watering recipe for the 
heroic space man’s favorite pie: 



FUDGE PE-KAN WITH HU- 
WIPPT CREAM TOPPING.” I 
thought if I ever smelled a cocoa 
bean. I’d turn inside out. There was 
a free-fall nurse in the grounding 
crew at the Sands who offered me 
a chocolate bar, and one of the 
doctors told me after I could under- 
stand speech again that she was the 
hardest-kicked women he had ever 
treated. It was weeks before her 
rear was fit to be seen. 

T hree or four years went by, and 
not a wave from Pick. My 
beam was erased because he never 
called for it. 

Nobody else heard from him, so 
I finally figured he had let a jeep 
or an antelope kill him or else he 
was under restraint someplace. I 
threw a big burnout by way of salut- 
ing his memory, and started figuring 
the fuel in my own tank was about 
used up. The automatic rehabs were 
standard by then, and spacemen 
were still a signal for locked doors 
whenever they touched dirt. I 
couldn’t stand the auto-rehabs. 

Then I made a bad one. Some- 
body spit in my fuel, or something, 
and it wouldn’t burn above Mars. 

The ground crew was asleep and 
lost me when I left my expected 
orbit, so rescue didn’t locate me un- 
til I was almost to the surface. The 
magnet had to grapple me so fast 
that the side of the pipe caved in 
and bust four of my ribs. 

When I got out of the hospital, 
I went over to Dome One for my 
orders and a draw, but I was mighty 
low. Even rock crushing in the high 
Geiger hills struj4c me as better than 



56 



IF 




kicking off again. I had the feeling 
that I’d used up all my luck, that 
if I got beyond radio range once 
more I’d never hear landing instruc- 
tions again. Just low. Rotten. They 
told me in the hospital that I’d been 
on Mars so much I couldn’t lose this 
rusty tan any more, and that kind 
of capped it. I was afraid to ride a 
pogo stick, let alone a kick pipe. 

At the office where I showed up 
for my draw, there was quite a de- 
lay. Ordinarily I would have bulged 
my aidock, but I was so low I just 
sat there, chewing a piece of that 
spongy red rock they sell to keep 
your mouth moist on Mars, and feel- 
ing a million years old. 

Finally the clerk came back, sand 
grinned at me. “Sorry to keep you, 
Galeg, but I knew there was some- 
thing besides money for you. This 
globe’s been waiting for you for 
six months.” 

I was fractured. Who in hagan 
would spend a thousand sparks to 
send me a solid message? When he 
handed it over, I could see it had 
something in it besides a tape: it 
was too big. Must have cost two 
thousand, and it had a “storage- 
pa id-till-called-for” stamp that must 
have gone another two fifty. 

Well, I stuck my thumb on the 
opener and as soon as it felt my 
thumb print, the seam opened all 
the way round. A little drive-control 
tape rolled out — only about enough 
for a couple million miles, and a let- 
ter. 

The letter said, “When you get 
within a thousand goobers of the 
green ball, splice this into your drive 
tape.” It was signed “Sheikh* Abou 



Pick Pratt” You mind a goober, 
don’t you? When the giil asked the 
pipe pusher how it felt to be a 
thousand nuiles off earth, he said, 
“Lady, a thousand miles is pea- 
nuts! Goobers!” Anyway, the mes- 
sage meant I was to cut in this drive 
when I made it to a million miles 
off Sol Three. 

It was an old joke between me 
and Pratt. That’s how I knew it 
was real. 

I fdt funny, I tell you. My air 
was leaking at every seam. Here I 
was, just about ready to give it up 
and cut the jet and here comes a 
voice from the dead, as you might 
say. And why “Sheikh Abou Pick 
Pratt?” If he was alive, was he 
rocky? 

Maybe he was in trouble. That 
was what convinced me — that and 
curiosity. I devilled the free-fall doc 
until he passed me, shaking his 
head. My own head felt like it was 
swelling up and then shrinking when 
i took off. Bewildered? I was a 
flamed-out tube, brother. 

r ten weeks, I changed my mind 
every hundred miles. Each time 
the tape cut on the jet fliame to cor- 
rect course, I knew I was that much 
closer to making the biggest deci- 
sion of my life. Was I going to splice 
that tape, or wasn’t I? I didn’t know. 
Just over a million miles off earth, 
I made up my mind. I jerked open 
the pilot case, ripped the tape in 
two and spliced in Picker’s roll, 
trying not to think about it. 

Right away, I wished I had 
thought about it. 

You don’t exactly fed direction 




OULED NAIL 



57 




changes in deep space, but there’s 
some sense that stays oriented, even 
out there, and I knew my direction 
was wrong as soon as the jets kicked. 
They just roared for a second, one 
hellacious kick, and I knew I was 
never going to fall on earth. 

I was floaiting in the few inches 
of leeway a pipe design gives you, 
with the pilot case right under my 
nose, and it was all I could do to 
keep from opening it again. 

But it wouldn’t have done me any 
good. To put back my old tape 
wouldn’t get me to earth now, not 
after that boot Pick had given me. 
I tell you, I was sweating combus- 
tible fuel. 

A few hours later, my anxiety 
had knotted my stomach like a fist. 
I was sweating so much the air was 
fouling, and tears were cutting their 
way out of me, too. I was light- 
headed and almost wild, with just 
enough brain left to know that it 
was the moon I was headed for. 

I began to laugh and sob like 
crazy then for sure. The moon! Sweet 
Jesus, the moon! Goddard the 
younger dead there because he 
couldn’t get off. Carlson blown up 
trying! Damned, dead, dusty, airless, 
heavy moon. Close enough to die 
on, but just too much mass for a 
man to carry enough fuel to kick 
from earth and then kick from the 
moon too. TTie reason a space sta- 
tion had to be built. Just too big 
to be. useful. Every piper’s night- 
mare — to die on the moon. One 
big kick from home, but one big 
kick too much. 

When my throat was tired and 
my tear ducts couldn’t pump any 



more, I began to pray. I prayed to 
Pick Pratt. 

“Pick,” I would whisper, “Pick, 
Pick, be there. Save me. Pick, I’m 
a dead man if you don’t. E>on’t don’t 
let me down. O God, make him be 
there. Pick, I’ve got to have fuel. Let 
me go, this once, let me get just to 
the space station, O please, Pick, 
please.” 

I should have known better than 
to use that tape. “Sheikh!” I thought 
now he was crazy, and I knew I was. 
I didn’t care. I cursed hirh for every 
son of a march I could put my ton- 
gue to, and I knew the words and the 
tune too. 

Then I’d pray a while longer. I’d 
make promises. If he’d let me go. 
I’d send others. I would have sent 
him my mother. Terror was a mile- 
post way behind me. I raved on like 
that until I fell on the moon. The 
last thing I remembered was sink- 
ing in a wallow of dust, halfway up 
the ports. I must have slept from 
exhaustion. When I woke up, I 
meant to open the airlock and have 
it over with, but I was too burned 
out to trip the release. 

I lay there, strangling in my own 
miasma and looking out at the 
plains when, all of a sudden, I saw 
Pratt. 

I knew it was he, even in his 
robes. He was riding in a dpme tmck 
and the treads were driving dust up 
in straight trajectories, he was com- 
ing so fast. In ten minutes he was 
there. First he touched the shell of 
my tube with a solid bar and shouted 
into a mike at his end, “You old 
fool, you overshot us. Hold your 



58 



IF 




nose until I get you to the dome.” 
Then he hung a grapple on me and 
began to sled me across the dust. 

He was all dressed in a set of 
robes and had something cloth 
twisted around his head, and a 
curly and a black beard, but tie 
looked like mom’s fudge pecan pie 
to me. I went to sleep while he sled- 
ded me in, and when he took me 
out of the tube and carried me, I 
was crying like a baby and mum- 
bling his name. 

He turned me over to a couple of 
dark skinned fourteen-year-old boys. 
They went to work on me like they’d 
been raised in a Broadway Turkisih 
bath. They stripped off my clothes, 
bathed me, massaged me, walked 
me around that bathroom, got some 
soup and coffee in me, evacuated 
me, washed me again, made me 
walk a little more and put me to bed. 

I don’t know how many days it 
was until I woke up in a bed that 
faced a doorway out into a court. 

There was a low table in the cen- 
ter of the court, beside a couple of 
palm trees. The sun ... it had to 
be artificial . was speckling the 
table with light. And there, cross- 
legged by the table, was Abou Pick 
Pratt. 

He was smoking a hookah and 
drinking coffee, and as soon as he 
saw I was awake, he clapped his 
hands. One of the fourteen-year-olds 
came in and helped me dress, but 
first he gave me a cup of thick, 
syrupy-sweet coffee. 

When I got out in the sun, I flop- 
ped down by the table, and accosted 
Pratt. “Pick,” I said, “tell me some- 
thing before I go nuts.” 



“You better eat,” he said, and 
clapped his hands. Then he took a 
pull on that water pipe and told me 
Charley Blount had been there the 
month before. Charley was an old 
cobber of ours that I hadn’t seen in 
seven — eight years. By the time we 
got Charley’s history cleaned^ up, 
we’d finished one meal and started 
another. 

In between we drank that sweet 
coffee. Haberschmidt was by, he 
told me, and Flonnie from France; 
and as it got to be afternoon and 
the shadow of the palms grew away 
from us, I began to realize that all 
the old crowd was coming here, and 
I guessed they’d all got solid mes- 
sages like me. 

“But how come. Pick?” 1 asked 
him. “How come? Tell me some- 
thing, or I’ll burn out again.” 

He looked at me like he figured 
maybe I’d make it now, and then he 
laid down the hookah and clapped 
for some more coffee. We’d drunk a 
bottle or two of some kind of wine 
during the day, and the coffee was 
welcome. 

“How do you feel?” he asked me. 
“Pretty good?” 

I stretched and lay back on some 
pillows with that dinky litde coffee 
cup, and all of a sudden I knew he 
was right. I was, you might say, 
rested for the first time in five or 
six years. Relaxed. Well fed but 
not gorged. 

I felt like I was eighteen again, 
and Mars was my oyster. I looked 
at him and felt more friendship for 
him than I’d thought 1 could feel, 
and I said, “Why, you old goat, you 
know how I feel. I never in my 



OULED NAIL 



59 




whole life felt better. Now tell me 
the whys and wherefores before I 
pull out that beard!” 

Just then I heard a giggle. 

I looked up to the shady side of 
the court, and shutters were begin- 
ning to open in the afternoon cool. 
Someone was watching us, from a 
gloom that held off identification. 
I was all on the alert in a minute. 
Somehow Fd let the size of the place 
escape me. There was room in that 
house for fifty people besides Pick. 
Who — or what, I thought, was 
watching me out of those windows? 
More of them began to open, and I 
was just getting my feet under me, 
when something happened that went 
through me like a ^ot. 

T here was a fountain in one cor- 
ner of the court, and a door 
about ten feet from it. The door 
opened silently, and a robed and 
veiled figure went to the fountain, 
filled a jug of water and left, closing 
the door as quietly. 

Well, it was a woman. She had 
on a robe like Pick’s, but it was a 
woman. There’s something about a 
woman. You can’t fool me. Besides, 
she looked at me. 

I looked at Pick, and he was smil- 
ing sort of sheepish. I swore. I got 
up, and sat down immediately. I was 
giddy. All th^t good, solid food in 
my middle began trying to recover 
its identity. I heard some more gig- 
gles and this time when I looked at 
the wall, I could see a dozen of them 
looking out, some shy and one or 
two bold, but all smiling like chil- 
dren on Christmas. One called out 
softly, “Me, Pick. Me.” 



“Pick Pratt,” I cried, “are you 
running what I think you’re run- 
ning?” 

His face kind of shut up, but his 
voice was just the same. He told 
me, “Not exactly. If this don’t suit 
your tastes, your pipe’s outside, with 
enough fuel to kick you back to 
Mars!” Then he clapp^ his hands 
three times, and there was a whole 
rustle of giggling and slippered feet 
on the stairs. In about a minute, six 
robes and veils glided out into the 
court and began a slow and stately 
dance that went to my head like 
sour mash. 

They only danced about three or 
four minutes, I guess. They were 
all veiled and shawled and wrapped, 
but here and there, as they glided 
past one another in the measures of 
the dance, there’d be a glimpse of 
curves or a flash of an ankle. They 
made their own music with little 
bells and bracelets around their an- 
kles. One lost a slipper and went on 
dancing with one bare foot. When 
she passed the slipper again, she 
gave a lazy kick, and it sailed ovct 
my head. 

I was a man in a dream. The 
gloom of dusk surrounded us. The 
slow movements of the women were 
the stuff of dreams. After a little, 
they sank down together in a heap, 
like a flower closing. 

Pratt made some signal I didn’t 
see, and a tall dark girl arose from 
the group and came to me like a 
sister. She bent and kissed me on 
the forehead, and her perfume fell 
around me in a cloud. I rose and 
followed her to her apartment in a 
kind of trance.

She broughft me a nmple meal oi 
cold meat, fruit, and a few small 
•alt rolls with caraway seed on them. 
When I shook my he^ she smiled 
and, lying beside me on the couch, 
fed me a few morsels. 

“A man must eat before he 
works,” she said, and her voice was 
golden bells laughing. We made love 
all that night, the way love is meant 
to be made, 

A man’s whole again when he 
wakes up to find his girl walking 
around the room just in a pair of 
pants, picking up the clothes, 
straightening things, maybe bring- 
ing him a cup of coffee when she 
sees he’s awake, and then crawling 
back into bed with him. Just easy. 
Natural. No side at all. 

That was a girl worth going a 
million miles for, or a billion. Along 
about the middle of the morning, she 
chased me downstairs to chew the 
fat* with Abou Pick again. I had 
lunch with him, and a bottle of 
Riesling. I wasn’t exactly sober, but 
I was the soberest I’d ever been 
after a trip from Mars, I’ll tell you 
that. 

I n the late afternoon, Pratt looked 
me in the eye and said, “Still 
worried about what I’m doing?” 

I looked him back. “I don’t know 
what you’re doing. I’m man enough 
to apologize for what I said yester- 
day, and I don’t care what your 
racket is. There’s ten million credits 
in high-G concentrate in my cargo 
cylinder. If that’s what you want, 
take it. Just tell me when my wel- 
come’s worn out,” 

“That’s up to you,” he told me. 



•*1 never ht a friend’s tube yet, and 
I’m not going to learn how on you. 
And I don’t covet your concentrat^. 
This place is yours, just as if you’d 
built k.” 

“Who did build it?” 

He smiled at that, and lit up ms 
hookah. The shutters began to open 
again, but there was no giggling 
today, and no faces visible, either 
— only in my apartment’, when she 
leaned out with the opening shut- 
ters, and beckoned me with a glance. 
I don’t mean a come-hither look. It 
was more a look that said, “Here 
I am.” 

I got up and went inside. Ey gow- 
rins, I knew I could talk to Pick 
any time. When I came in, she said, 
“Does it please my master to return 
to his own place?” 

“None of that ‘master’ routine, 
baby,” I told her. “Just you and 
me. What’s your name?” 

“Rachel.” Rachel! It rings in my 
head now. I said, “You can call me 
what my mother called me — ” and 
I told her, though I won’t tell you. 

If the first night had been an 
ecstasy, this one was a fulfillment. 
Rachel! I made a symphony of her 
name. 

Next day, when she ran me out 
so she could clean the place up, I 
went straight downstairs and. took 
Abou Pick Pratt by the throat. 
“Picker — ” I let him see I meant 
it — “you and me have been through 
a lot of bad landfalls together. This 
is the best one I’ll ever have. But 
I’m being eaten by curiosity. Who’s 
that girl. Pick? Who’re all the rest? 
Mow’d you get here? If you don’t 
tell me. I’ll strangle you; and if I’m

just a dream of yours in a mad- 
house, ril vanish happy after the 
las^ two days. Are you going to 
talk?” 

he pushed me down on a pile of 
pillows. “Gallegher,” he says to me, 
“you’re ready for the truth. These 
girls are Ouled Nails, and I’m the 
old man of the joint.” 

He could have answered in San- 
skrit and told me more, but I worm- 
ed it all out of him at last. After we 
split up, he’d given a lot of thought 
to our old landfall problems. Some- 
where, he heard about the Ouled 
Nails, the girls who consoled and 
rehumanized Arab wanderers on the 
border for generations; and he ask- 
ed himself if a pipe pusher’s prob- 
lem differed in kind or in degree 
from a camel pusher’s. 

“It’s the solitude,” he explained, 
“and the awful monotony. That’s 
what drains a man’s manliness into 
a bottomless pit of anxiety and 
leaves him drifting like a burnt-out 
tube with a cracked cargo cylinder. 
Girls alone won’t restore the bal- 
ance, for a man needs mother, sis- 
ter, wife, brother, father and uncle 
all at once and in a hurry to bring 
him back to himself. That’s where 
I come in. At every oasis in North 
Africa where the Ouled Nails are, 
there’s an old man who catches the 
wanderer up on his news and on his 
friends before the girls get in their 
licks. I’m the old man here.” 

H e didn’t say any more, and neith- 
er did I. Lunch came on about 
then, and I devoted myself to the 
food and kept my tongue between 
my teeth. 



When we started on the coffee, I 
asked him quiet where he got the 
women and he tdd me. They were 
the real thing, right from North 
Africa, and thdr ambition was to 
go back to the village of Ouled NaM 
weighted down with gold coins and 
silks. 

“I’ve got a solar-powered con- 
verter out back,” Pick went on. 
“Turns out fine gold along with 
fuel for the tubes. The silks they 
can buy for themselves in ‘Paris on 
their way home. Meanwhile, they’re 
a thousand years ahead of all the 
automatic rehab units all the tecks 
in the system can build into a tube.” 

Pratt was right there. I always 
damaged the rehab unit as soon as 
I was in free fall, so I wouldn’t have 
to listen to it and smell it throwing 
around the odor of mashed potatoes 
and gravy and have it reminding me 
to take my muscle tone pills. The 
monotony and solitude were better. 

But of course a human being’s 
always better than a machine, for 
any job where they can be compared 
at all. 

I laughed until I was roaring, but 
it was no hysteria. When I quieted 
down, I put it to Pick: “How much 
is the tariff, and none of your pals- 
to4he-end routine now. How much?” 

He grinned at me, and we squar- 
ed it off at ten thousand credits. I 
was to send it to his bank in Texas, 
at the little town near the robot fac- 
tory where we’d ridden jeep so long 
before, as it seemed now. 

Pick knew I wouldn’t cheat him. 
I v/anted to come back on my next 
trip, and no teck in the system could 
tape me to the moon’s off earth side 



62 



IF 




— or would. They’d have me jugged 
for asking. 

He was to send me a hundred- 
credit message globe with a short 
tape, and it would put me right at 
his dome. 

I stuck around about a week. 
When Rachel — well, when Rachel 
began to look like just a girl, I flam- 
ed off to the s»pace station. 

I was in earth gravity just long 
enough to send Pick his ten thousand 
jets. Then I checked in at the Sands 
for a kick to Mars. I’ve been riding 
a tape to the other side of the moon 
ever since. That’s where I was until 
two days ago. 

Whenever we old-timers spot a 
youngster who looks like he’ll make 
a man riding the hot tubes, we feel 
him out a couple of times while he’s 
floating, and Pick drops him a globe 
with an Quled Nail tape in it. Once 
a man’s tried it, he’ll never go back 
to automatic rehabs. 

Of course, the ten thousand jets 
don’t pay for it. Old Pick! He steals 
a kilo or two of high Geiger con 
every time you go, and it’s hard to 
explain sometimes; but it happens 
so often nobody worries much any 
more. 



W e sat in reflective silence for 
a moment, and drained our 
beers. Gallegher signaled a waiter. 

“Where does your friend sell the 
high-G he steals?” I asked. 

The big G frowned at me. “1 
thought you’d get it. You’re a taper-^j 
and a smart one, they say. I guess 
I’m the only one that sees through 
the old fraud, after all.” 

“Why do you say he’s- a fraud? 
It may not be a savory business, but 
it serves a worthy social function, 
and I for one am not prepared to 
say, even from a moral stand- 
point . .” 

“Oh, dry up,” said Gallegher. 
“Didn’t I tell you where his bank 
is, or wasn’t you listening? Them 
things on the other side of the moon 
is all robots, including Pick. He 
must have died after he got ’em all 
up there from that robot factory, and 
they rebuilt one of themselves to 
look like him ’cause he was the 
high-gravity for us old-timers. With- 
out the high Geiger they steal off 
us, the whole place would run down 
inside of six months like an unwound 
clock . You reckon that waiter’s 
gone to sleep against that wall?”

J ame Relief, Second Secretary of 
the Terrestrial Embassy to 
South Skweem, turned at a shrill 
hail from the low docMway of one 
of the squat grass huts lining the 
dusty main street of the capital

“Good mornings, Terry,” a knob-

“Sorry, Mr. Uptakapacheenobuf-

Much as we Terries want to im-

Works Project, it can’t be anything 
useful. According to the Under- 
ground E>eep-Thin!k Teams back at 
Sector, that might be taken as an 
implied criticism of your culture.” 
The Skweeman made a rubbery 
noise indicating mild disappoint- 
ment. “Yous know I’d likes to throw 
my weights behind the Terry pro- 
gram, but without a few goody to 
show for it, what’s the percentage?” 
“I see what you mean, Mr. Upta- 
kapacheenobufers. I’d better start by 
installing a couple of new transistors 
in that language teacher I lent you. 
It seems to have imparted a faulty 
grasp of the plural.” 

“Hecks, Retief, call me ’takapach- 
eenobuifers for shorts. I guess we’re 
chum now, after those snort we had 
together last night. Wows, what a 
hangovers!” 

“Speaking of headaches, I have 
to hurry along to Staff Meeting. Too 
bad about the roof, but if you think 
of something spectacularly super- 
fluous the town needs, hasten to let 
Ambassador Treadwater know. He’s 
sweating out his next E.R.” 

Retief went along to the large hut 
which served as the Terran Chan- 
cery; inside, he took a camp stool 
among the staff assembled before a 
low split-bamboo podium which 
sagged visibly under tie bulk of the 
Chief of Mission. 

ii'^J'ow, then,” the Ambassador 
i ^ opened the meeting briskly. 
“First this morning we’ll take a look 
at the challenge which confronts us, 
gentlemen.” He signalled and the 
lights dimmed. A projector hum- 
oaed. On the rostrum, a life-sized. 



three-dimensional, vividly colored 
image of a stubby, boxy Skweeman 
appeared under a glowing legend 
reading KNOW YOUR ENEMY. 
Treadwater tapped the solidogram 
with his rubber-tipped pointer. 

“This, gentlemen,” he stated, 
“might appear to some of you to 
bear a superficial resemblance to our 
great allies, those valiant freedom 
fighters, the South Skweemans. How- 
ever, to a practiced eye it’s at once 
apparent that it is, in fact, a North 
Skweeman. Note the sly expression, 
the general air of inscrutability, the 
fierce oast of eye . .” The point- 
er rapped each feature in turn. 

“Ah . Mr. Ambassador.” Col- 
onel Pluckwyn, the Military Attache, 
raised an interrogatory finger from 
his seat in the front row. “I don’t 
believe that last organ was precisely 
an eye. More of an ear, I think you’ll 
find.” 

“Whatever it is, it has a fierce 
cast!” Treadwater snapped. “Now 
let’s move along to the coloration.” 
He studied the simulacrum. “Hmm, 
ah offensive greenish purple with 
clashing dun rosettes.” 

“Golly, Mr. Ambassador,” the 
Cultural Attache’s voice piped from 
the rear. “Maybe I’m mixed up, but 
aren’t our Skweemans the same col- 
or?” 

“Certainly not! Quite the opposite! 
The South Skweeman is characteriz- 
ed by a soothing overall tannish 
tone, tastefully set off with purply- 
green rosettes. Not the same at all.” 

“Yes, but—” 

“Now, about the warts.” The Am- 
bassador pursued his point. “Note 
that this fellow has large blue ones,

IF 




with tufts of yellowish hair.” 

“But, sir — isn’t that what the 
South Skweemans have?” 

Tread water smiled patronizingly. 
“A common mistake, Dimplick. Ac- 
tually, the South Skweeman is adorn- 
ed with somewhat smaller warts, 
bearing attractive tufts of golden 
hair.” 

“Oop, my mistakes, boss,” a thin 
South Skweeman voice chirped from 
the direction of the projector. “Looks 
like I accidentally slipped in a shots 
of the South Skweeman Minister of 
Eats and Drinks. A nice likeness, 
too, made just before the mob got 
him.” The image flicked out of exis- 
tence and another, obscurely differ- 
ent, took its place. 

“Well, I’m sure we all get the 
general idea, anyway,” the Cultural 
Attache offered breathlessly, as 
Treadwater’s face took on a danger- 
ous shade of purple. 

“Yeah — these are a shot of the 
common foe,” the projectionist an- 
nounced. “Boy, will you look at 
those look of ferocity?” 

“Take it away!” Treadwater bel- 
lowed. “And I suggest you look to 
your labels, sir, before you create an 
international incident!” He yanked 
his pale violet lapels back in line. 
“Now, it’s time to get on to the 
substantive portion of today’s brief- 
ing.” He beetled his brows at his 
audience. 

“You’re all aware that the success 
of our mission here depends on es- 
tablishing the legitimacy of the gov- 
ernment to which I — that is, we — 
are accredited. Namely, that of Free 
Skweem, formerly known as South 
Skweem. We are similarly aware that 



next month’s plebiscite will deter- 
mine once and for all whether the 
mantle of planetary leadership falls 
on the shoulder of our sturdy allies, 
the South Skweemans, or on the 
bowed backs of the North Skweeman 
insurgents, the satellites of the un- 
principled Groaci.” 

“I have a suggestion,” the Politi- 
cal Officer broke in excitedly. “We 
could hire some of the rougher local 
patriots to patrol the polling places, 
weeding out undesirables, distribut- 
ing special disappearing ballots 
among the opposition and making 
a few minor adjustments to the 
counting machines to insure a vic- 
tory for democratic processes!” 
“This is no time for subtlety,” 
Treadwater stated flatly. “We must 
impress the locals of both political 
persuasions with our superior capa- 
city to bestow largesse. We need, 
gentlemen, a large and impressive 
symbol of Terran generosity and 
technical virtuosity. The floor is now 
open for your suggestions.” 

T he Ambassador waited. The si- 
lence was profound. 
“Gentlemen,” Treadwater said 
ominously, “a full week has passed 
since I first requested suggestions 
from the staff — and as of today, the 
net response has been nil!” 

A shuffling of feet greeted the 
accusation. 

“A curious lethargy seems to have 
afflicted you, gentlemen.” The Am- 
bassador stared around belligerently. 
“This, while a certain foreign mis- 
sion daily entrenches itself more se- 
curely, prestige-wise, by virtue of a 
certain probably illegal but nonethe-

less highly effective propoganda de- 
vice. I refer, of course, to the dam 
the Groaci have bestowed on their 
North Skweeman toadies.” 

“I propose we build a dam too,” 
someone said quickly. 

“Wonderful notion,” the Econo- 
mic Officer rumbled. “About to 
suggesit it myself — ” 

“Say, Charlie, you’re hitting right 
in there this morning,” a First Sec- 
retary offered. Tliere were clucks 
and chuckles of admiration from the 
rest of the staff. Treadwater waited 
for the approbation to die down. 

“The dam constructed by the 
Groaci engineers at the point where 
the river loops briefly into North 
Skweem,” he purred, “has not only 
crippled South Skweeman com- 
merce, but has effected a drought 
which is rapidly starving our brave 
allies into an advanced state of mal- 
nutrition, complicated by dust 
storms. Add to this the unfortunate 
flooding of that portion of the na- 
tion’s farmland lying above the dam 
and we see, gentlemen, a striking 
example of creative public relations 
— unhappily, in the service of the 
opposition. Now — ” he smiled thin- 
ly at the group — “will someone 
kindly tell me what possible detri- 
ment would accrue to our rivals if 
I were so ill-advised as to construct 
still another navigational hazard in 
what was once this nation’s main 
artery of communication!” His voice 
rose to an apoplectic bellow on the 
last words. No one volunteered a 
reply. 

A junior Third Secretary raised a 
hand timidly. Treadwell blinked ex- 
pectantly. 



“Ah ... sir. The dam is creating 
a sizable lake, I understand. What 
do the Groaci have in mind doing 
with all that water?” 

“Bh? Do? Nothing, of course!” 
the Ambassador snapped. “The en- 
tire project was designed merely to 
harass me! Or rather, us! The proud 
and independent populace of South 
Skweem, that is to say!” 

“Oh.” The young man subsided. 
“Well, then,” the Ambassador 
went on, idly calm now. “Let us try 
again, gentlemen, avoiding, if pos- 
sible, the idiotic.” 

“Well, Mr. Ambassador, Project 
Proposals are a tricky proposition,” 
the quavering voice of the elderly 
Press Attache offered. “There was 
quite a row kicked up in certain 
journals concerning that hundred- 
man bird bath the CDT built for the 
Quomt before we discovered they 
were allergic to water. And it will 
be quite a while before we live down 
the shoe factory we gave the Jaq, 
since they seem to have no feet to 
speak of. And there was a certain 
amount of criticism of — ” 

“I’m well aware of the history of 
the fiasco, as practiced by my col- 
leagues,” Treadwater cut him off 
glacially. “It is precisely for that 
reason that I am determined to pre- 
sent to Sector Headquarters a Pro- 
posal which will bear microscopic 
scrutiny, farce-wise. Now, thinking 
caps, men! I needn’t remind you that 
we are caught between the mortar of 
Groaci expansionism and the pestle 
of Corps policy. If the government 
to whi<± are accredited is not starv- 
ed out from under us, we still face 
an unfilled Project Quote.”

“Damned awkward, sir,” Colonel 
Pliickwyn, murmured. “Couldn’t we 
just give the beggars a touch of the 
old quirt? A small fractional mega- 
tonner, say, just to teach ’em their 
manners.” 

“Bomb Headquarters?” Tread- 
water looked astonished. 

“Actually I was thinking of the 
North Skweemans, sir, but your sug- 
gestion has merit — 

“Colonel, I dunk you’d better 
report to the dispensary after Staff 
Meeting, for skidl X-rays,” Tread- 
water said bleakly. “I suspect the 
plates will come out blank. Now, 
let’s move along to Mr. Magnan’s 
report.” The Ambassador glanced 
expectantly over the seated diplo- 
mats. 

“Magnan? Where is the fellow, 
drat it!” The Ambassadorial eye 
fixed on Retief. “You, there. What’s- 
your-name. Magnan’s your chief, I 
believe. Where the devil is he?” 

4 yTr. Magnan failed to confide 

iVAin me. Your Excellency,” 
Retief said. 

“Didn’t your Excellency send him 
over to call on the Groaci Ambas- 
sador?” Dimpliok queried. 

“Of ^course,” Treadwater agreed. 
“I instructed him to unobtrusively 
scout out the effects of the new dam 
under cover of the protocol visit. 
It is that on which I wish his re- 
port.” 

“Mr. Magnan went across the line 
into North Skweem, alone?” Retief 
inquired casually. 

“I believe that is where his Groa- 
cian Excellency is usually to be 
found,” Treadwater replied testily. 



glancing at his finger watch. “And 
he was distinctly directed to be back 
before tiffin time.” 

“The present crisis may have 
thrown off the tiffin schedule,” Re- 
tief conjectured. 

Treadwater frowned ominously. 
“Are you suggesting the scoundrels 
may have so far forgotten their pro- 
tocol as to have detained an accred- 
ited diplomat in the performance of ' 
his duty?” 

^'Something seems to have de- 
tained him,” Pluckwyn offered. 

“I hope he didn’t go sniffing too 
closely around the dam,” the Polit- 
ical Officer said soberly. “Those 
North Skweemans can be pretty nas- 
ty. I saw some atrocity photos oui 
visual aid people mocked-up, based 
on reliable rumors — ” 

“Oh, boy.” The Press Attache 
doddered to his feet. “This’ll make 
great copy, chief. ‘TERRY ENVOY 
MURDERED . 

“Who said any thing about mur- 
der, you cretin!” Treadwater roar- 
ed. “I merely noted that the man is 
late for Staff Meeting!” 

“Yes, I supose you’re right.” The 
Press Attaches sat down reluctantly. 
Then he brightened. “Still, if he 
hasn’t shown up by sundown . .” 
He began jotting notes on his scratch 
pad. 

“Well, if there are no further fol- 
lies with which to waste our time, 
that’s all for this morning, gentle- 
men,” the Ambassador growled. 
“But I shall be looking for results 
— prompt, dramatip results!” He 
swept the group with a final expec- 
tant glare, moved ponderously down 
from the shaky platform.

“Say, Mr. ketief,” the young 
Third Secretary came up beside him 
as they stepped out into the hot, 
dusty sunlight. “What really is the 
difference between North Sk wee- 
mans and South Skweemans?” 

“Very simple, Teddy. South 
Skweemans are natural democrats.” 

“Oh . The youth fell back as 
Treadwater beckoned Retief over. 

“About Magnan,” the Ambassa- 
dor said offnhandedly. “It’s occurred 
to me the situation might bear look- 
ing into. Never can tell what these 
unprincipled foreigners might take 
a fancy to perpetrate — not that 1 
think Magnan is any difficulty, of 
course. But I’ve been thinking pos- 
sibly we might just dispatch some- 
one to make sure.” 

“Excellent idea, sir,” Retief 
agreed. 

“Actually, I’ve been wondering 
whom I could spare long enough to 
attend to the chore.” Treadwater 
put a thoughtful finger to his chins. 

“Indeed, sir?” Retief encouraged. 

“Frankly, your name popped into 
my mind.” 

“Very flattering, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor. A pity you assigned me to do 
the liquor inventory. Otherwise I’d 
be delighted.” 

“Never mind the inventory — if 
you’re sure you really feel you 
should go.. .” 

“Well . 

‘Wery well, then, if you insist. 
Though personally I think you young 
fellows spook too easily. Well, I must 
hurry along, Retief. Let me hear 
from you.” He turned and strode 
away. 

“How’d it go, Retief?” Uptaka- 



pacheenobufers called from his dooi^ 
way. 

“Predictably,” Retief said,

T he once-purple and verdant 
countryside of Skweem was a 
wan, sun-baked expanse of water- 
starved fields criss-crossed with the 
dusty gulleys x)f empty irrigation 
ditches. Tinder-dry stalks of mud- 
wheat stood in endJeJss, arid rows 
across the cracked, concrete-like 
clay. 

Retief studied the view as ho 
steered the official ground-car with 
the CDT pennant flapping from the 
prow along the rocky road that par- 
alleled the dry river bed, where 
stranded boats rested high and dry, 
their formerly bright paint and rig- 
ging as bleached and sere as the 
land. A few listless South Sk wee- 
man peasants waved spiritless greet- 
ings from the shade of their huts as 
he passed. Others merely stared with 
drooping visual organs. 

It was an hour’s drive to the heavy 
barbed-wire fence that marked the 
North Skweeman border. Retief pull- 
ed to a stop at the gate. A large, 
warty North Skweeman in official 
loops of braid decorated by dangling 
straps and medals undulated over, 
fingering a blast rifle of unmistak- 
able Groaci manufacture. 

“What’s your problem, Two- 
eyes?” he inquired in Skweemish. 

“Just a courtesy call,” Retief re- 
plied in the same tongue. “Tell me, 
did you see another Terry pass here 
early this morning?” 

The Skweeman’s eyes shifted. 

IF

**Naw, nothing like that,” he said 
flatly. 

“This fellow would be hard to 
miss,” Retief persisted. “Twelve feet 
tall, flaming red hair all over, three 
eyes — ” 

“FrinkleTruit! The guy wasn’t as 
big as you, and . .” His voice trailed 
9ff. 

“I see,” Retief nodded. “Well, he 
was taking a birthday cake to the 
Groaci Ambassador, and it seems 
he losit the cherry off the top of it. 
We Terries are pitching in to help 
locate anyone who might have de^ 
ktyed him.” 

“Not me, Terry! I waved him 
through and he headed straight for 
town — thataway.” He pointed along 
the road. 

“Fine. I’ll tell them you’re clean, 
then.” 

“Gee, thanks, fella.” The guard 
set his gun aside and opened the 
gate. 

“Think nothing of it.” Retief wav- 
ed cheerily and drove through. 

A mile and a half past the gate 
he encountered a small village, 
identical with its South Skweeman 
equivalent. Rows of grass huts, of 
various sizes depending on the status 
of their occupants, were arranged 
around a small grassed plaza in the 
center of which the public struc- 
tures were grouped. As Retief pulled 
up to the tall, conical buildings 
which presumably housed the town 
officials, half a dozen uniformed 
North Skweemans came to the alert. 
One, more elaborately decorated 
than his fellows, wobbled forward 
and looked the car over with the air 



of a Customs officer tipped off to 
a load of contraband. 

“What brings you here?” he de- 
manded. 

“I’m looking for the Groaoi Con- 
sulate General,” Retief said. 

“Yeah? Where’d you lose it?” the 
Skweeman came back snappily. 

“The last I heard it was neck-deep 
in North Skweeman internal affairs,” 
Retief replied breezily.’ “But that’s 
for you fellows to worry about.” He 
looked around the somnolent town 
square. “I don’t suppose you know 
where I might find a fellow Terry 
who wandered over the line while 
chasing a promotion?” 

“You got that one right,” the 
Skweeman nodded. 

“Well, in that case I’ll just move 
along and take a look at the dam 
the Groaci suckered you into letting 
them build on your property.” He 
glanced along the line of the parch- 
ed river-bed to the looming wall of 
concrete half a mile distant. “I see 
it’s still holding. Water’s about half- 
way to the spillway now, eh?” He 
looked thoughtful. 

“Whattaya mean, suckered? That’s 
the finest dam on Skweem!” 

“Urn,” Retief said. “What’s it 
for?” 

“Huh? To hold back the water, 
whattaya think?” 

“Why?” 

“On acount of ... so we can . 
I mean, it’s for . .” The Skweeman 
broke off. “Listen, you better talk 
to old Five-eyes personal; I mean, 
what’s the big idea trying to pump 
me for military secrets?” 

“Military secrets, eh? Well, that’s 
interesting. Just what sort of illegal 



DAM KUISANCE 



71 




military plans are you concocting 
over on thiis side of the line?” 

“We got no illegal plains!” 

“Any military plans are illegel/* 
Retief said flatly. 

“Who says so?” 

“The CDT.” 

“Oh, yeah?” 

“Uh-hu)h. And we have the mili- 
tary resources to back it up, if you’ll 
goad us far enough. Starting a w€ir 
ought to do it. And now, if youH 
just sort of slither to one side, 111 
get on with my business.” 

“Hey, you can’t — ” The North 
Skweeman’s words were drowned in 
a cloud of dust as Retief gunned the 
car off toward the massive pile of 
the dam. 

R etief parked the car on a stretch 
of bulldozed gravel on the 
shoulder of the hill against which the 
abutment was anchored. Carrying a 
pair of miniaturized 100x9 binocu- 
lars, he moved up in the shelter of 
a small shed housing the dam’s 
power controls, looked over the 
scene below. 

To the right of the massive con- 
crete barrier a parched valley wound 
away toward the North Skweeman 
border. Patches of mud gleaming 
here and there at the bottom of the 
gorge were all that remained of the 
former river. To the left stretched 
a broad lake of blue-black water, its 
breeze-riffled surface reflecting the 
greenish late-morning sim. Under it 
lay a hundred square miles of South 
Skweem’s best farm land, now forty 
feet deep in backed-up river water. 

A narrow catwalk lined with pole- 
mounted polyarcs for night opera- 



tions 'crossed the top of the dam. 
On the far side a crew of Skweeman 
construction workers in baggy ochre 
overalls toiled under the supervision 
of a spindle-legged Groaci engineer, 
putting the finishing touches on the 
job. Other Skweemans, heavy-laden, 
struggled up a trail across the steep 
slope from below like a column of 
ants. A touch of color met Retiefs 
eye. He fine-focused the glasses, 
picked out the sagging shape of a 
small hut half-concealed in the brush 
near the base of the dam. Through 
ks open door he saw the edge of a 
coM of wire, shelves, the corners of 
packing cases. 

A Groaci supervisor stepped into 
the field of vision, dosed the door, 
hung a look on it, followed the 
workers up the trail. Retief lowered 
the glasses thoughtfully. Then, keep- 
ing low, he moved off in the con- 
cealment of deep brush. 

It was a stiff climb down to the 
floor of the ravine. Retief completed 
it without arousing unwelcome at- 
tention. He came up on the supply 
hut from the rear. Nothing moved 
near it now. The lock looked stout 
enough, but the warped boards of 
the door were riddled with dry rot. 
At a sharp kick it bounced rattling- 
ly open. 

Inside, Retief looked over a stock 
of tools, reinforcing steel fittings, 
detonator caps, mechanical spares 
for the pumps — and a generous 
supply of compressed smashite: 
three-inch rods of a bilious yellow 
color, each capable of excavating a 
hundred cubic yards of hard rock 
in one blast. Quickly, Retief selected 
materials and set to work.

H e left the shed ten minutes later, 
unreeding a ooii of two-conduc- 
tor insidated wire behind 'him. The 
ascent to the diff-top took half an 
hour, by which time the workmen 
had oompieted the task at hand and 
were busily packing up their tools. 
Retief made his way up-slope to the 
control shed. 

Its corrugated metal door stood half 
open. Inside, the floor was littered 
with smpped-off bits of wire, empty 
cartons that had contained switching 
gear and the butts o»f several dozen 
Qroaci dope sticks. Ain inspection of 
the panels showed that the wiring 
was complete. Five more minutes’ 
study indicated that the large white 
toggle switch beside the door con- 
trolled the polyarcs atop the dam. 

Redef brought the ends of his 
wires into the shed, linked them 
into the lighting circuit. Against the 
gray floor, the insulated lines were 
almost invisible. 

Back outside, he brushed loose 
sand over the wires leading up from 
below, then headed back to the car. 
He topped the rise, halted at sight 
of two bile-green cars bearing the 
crossed-oculars insignia of the South 
Skweeman Home Guard, parked 
across the bumpers of the CDT ve- 
hicle. There were eight armed Skwee- 
mans in sight, patrolling alertly 
around the blocked car, while a 
pair of Groaci stood by, dapper in 
Bermuda shorts and solar topis, deep 
in conversation. 

As Retief strolled down to meet 
the reception committee, the locals 
swiveled to cover him with their 



guns. The two Groaoi stared, their 
eye-stalks twitching hypnotically. 
Retief reco-gnized one as a member 
of the Groaci diplomatic staff. 

“Good morning, Lith,” Retief 
greeted the Groaci Councillor as he 
came up. “Keeping busy, I see.” 
“To depart instantly,” the Groaci 
diplomat hissed in his faint voice. 
“To explain at once this illegal in- 
trusion on North Skweeman soil!” 
“Which would you like first, the 
explanation or the departure?” Re- 
tief inquired interestedly. 

‘To make no jest of this red- 
handed crime. Terrain interloper!” 
Lith whispered urgently. His multi- 
ple eyes fell on the miniature bino- 
culars in Retief ’s hand. 

“As I thought.” He motioned to 
his Skweeman aides. “Your presence 
explains itself.” He stepped back to 
allow the gun-handlers to dose in. 
“Cover him,” he ordered. “At the 
first false move, fire.” 

“You’re in a devil-may-care mood 
this morning,” Retief noted. “Given 
up all hope of advancement, I sup- 
pose, and want to go out in a blaze 
of notoriety by making an even big- 
ger mistake than usual.” 

“What did you observe up there?” 
The second Groaci indicated the top 
of the rise. 

“Just what’s there,” Retief replied 
easily. 

The two Groaci exchanged 
glances, a feat they accomplished 
with one pair of eyes while keeping 
two on Retief and another on the 
Skweemans. Retief whistled in ad- 
miration. 

“No sigftdling,” one of them 
warned.

*To poke yoxir long Terry nose 
in once too often,” Litih said. He 
made a curt gesture with a pair of 
arms. “Take him,” he commanded 
the Skweemans. 

“Before you do that — ” Retief 
held up an admonitory hand — 
“maybe it would be a good idea to 
ask Lith wihat the future plan for 
North Skweem might be — if North 
Skweem has a future.” 

CiOilence!” Lith keened. “To take 

^ care, Terry, not to tempt me 
too far!” 

“Hey, talk Skweemish,” one of 
the guards objected. “What are you 
two foreigners cooking up, anyway?” 

“We’re merely nattering of trivial- 
ities,” Lith explained. “Now do your 
duty, fellows.” 

“Yeah . but 1 been thinking: 
this sapsucker is a Terry diplomat.” 

“Enough,” Lith cut him off. “1 
assure you no complaints will be 
lodged by his associates.” 

The Skweemans closed in on Re- 
tief. “All right, big boy, let’s go,” 
the lieutenant said, poking his gun 
at the prisoner. 

Retief glanced at the weapon. It 
was a heavy-duty power pistol, a 
Groacian copy of an early Terran 
type. 

“Have you ever fired that thing?” 
he inquired interestedly. 

“Who, me?” the Skweeman ro- 
tated a number of sense organs in 
a gesture expressing astonishment. 
“Heck, no. We got orders to only 
shoot at live targets.” He looked 
meaningfully at Retief. 

“A wise precaution. I understand 
that model blows up rather easily.

IF 



That’s why the Groad sold them to 
you at bargain prices.” 

**To make no attempt to subvert 
my minions!” Lith hissed. 

‘T wouldn’t dream of it,” Retief 
assured the ruffled diplomat. “I pre- 
fer minions wiho change sides on 
their own.” 

“You will have long to wait for 
that eventuality,” Lith snapped. “In 
a cell which, alas, lacks most of the 
amenities.” 

“That’s all right,” Retief said. 
“Peihaps I won’t be in it long 
enough to need them.” 

Lith vibrated his throat-sac, ex- 
pressing amusement. 

“You may be right, my dear Ter- 
ry,” he commented blandly. “Now, 
into your vehicle, and drive as di- 
rected, remembering that guns are 
upon you!” 

Escorted by the two police cars, 
Retief drove the CDT Monojag at 
a sedate pace along the indicated 
route to the village, pulled it in be- 
fore a low mud brick building with 
one small window set with metal 
bars. Lith and the Skweeman police 
surrounded him as he stepped out 
into the street. One of the cops 
peered into the interior of the Mono- 
jag. 

“Hey,' this is a fancy job,” he 
commented. “What’s that?” He 
pointed at a short red-handled lever 
labeled EMERGENCY LIFT. At his 
side, Lith goggled, then whirled on 
Retief. 

‘To explain at once!” he hissed. 
“Our intelligence reports have in- 
dicated that vehicles so equipped are 
capable of VTO and supersonic 
speeds! Why, then, did you permit

yourself to be so docilely convoyed?” 

“Well, Litih, maybe those reports 
you read were exaggerated,” Retief 
smiled deprecatingly. “After all, 
your gumnsihoe brigades have to re- 
port something** 

Lith snorted. “So much for the 
vstunted Terry technology.” He turn- 
ed to his troops. 

“Look him up.” 

The Skweemans dosed in to box 
Retief, like alert, waist-high goblins 
modelled in blotchy day; their guns 
prodded him along an alley to a 
small metal door set in the side of 
the brick building. The lieutenant 
opened it with a clumsy electrokey, 
waved him inside. The door dank^ 
shut and a shadowy figure rose up, 
its face pale in the dim light. 

“Red^!” First Secretary Magnan 
gasped. “You mean they captured 
you, too?” 

“It seemed the simplest way to 
solve the problem of finding you,” 
Retief said. “Now all we have is the 
problem of getting out.” 

Ill 

T he Skweeman sun was low in the 
sky now. A brisk, hot wind had 
sprung up from the north, whirling 
streamers of dust into the cell 
through the barred window from 
which Retief watched the activity 
in the street. Behind him, Magnan 
turned away, coughing. 

^“They’re as busy as Verpp in 
moulting season,” he sniffed. “No 
one is paying us the slightest atten- 
tion. I suppose we may rot here for 
hours more before Ambassador 
Treadwell secures our release.” 



“There’s just one cop patrolling 
the jail now,” Retief said. “The rest 
of them have trooped off, arm in 
arm with their friends the Groaci. 
I think we picked a bad time for 
our calls; they’re up to something.” 

“I can’t think what’s keeping 
him!” Magnan eyed his watch fret- 
fully. “I’m missing my afternoon 
coffee break, to say nothing of din- 
ner.” He sighed heavily, settled him- 
self on the floor. 

“I simply can’t gra^p it,” he mut- 
tered. “The Groaci are famed for 
their chicaneries, but open diplomat- 
napping broaches an entirely new 
field of rascality. Why, an honest 
diplomat won’t even be able to nip 
around to troubled areas, picking up 
eye-witness impressions, without the 
risk of being treated as a mere spy!” 

“On the other hand, if we join in 
the spirit of the thing — ” Retief 
turned from the window — “We 
might find that it opens up novel 
avenues to us, too.” He went across 
to the narrow door, leaned over to 
the barred, waist^high opening, and 
shouted for the guard. 

“Good idea.” Magnan got to his 
feet. “I think it’s time we spoke 
sharply to these brigands. Just stand 
aside, Retief, and I’ll drop a few 
broad hints.” His voice faded as the 
fierce visage of the police lieutenant 
appeared beyond the aperture. Retief 
spok first: 

“Do you have any idea what a 
blaster would do to you if I fired 
from this range?” he inquired. 
“Don’t give any alarm,” he went on 
as the speechless cop goggled into 
the dark cell. “Just quietly unlock 
the door — and be siu*e no one no-

“B . b . b . the Skwee- 
man said. 

“You can express your astonish- 
ment later,” Relief said briskly. “Op- 
en up now, before I have to demon- 
strate how well armed I am.” 

“I ... I didn’t see any weapon 
on you when we brought you in,” 
the jailer expostulated. 

“Naturally; it’s the sort of thing a 
fellow likes to keep secret. Hop to 
it, now. My trigger finger is twitch- 
mg. 

“I had to be a wise guy and vol- 
unteer to be a big ^ot,” the Skwee- 
man muttered to himself. Relief 
heard the scrape of the key in the 
look. Tumblers clicked over. The 
door swung in with a dry squeak. 

“!^h!” Magnan put a finger to 
his lips, looked severely at the native 
as he sidled out past him. He looked 
both ways. 

“The coast seems to be clear,” he 
whispered as Relief lifted the cop’s 
pistol from its holster. “Maybe you’d 
better let me have one of the guns.” 

“Hey!” The Skweeman waved 
several sensory organs in an agitated 
way. “I don’t see any blaster — ex- 
cept mine!” 

“Nothing wrong with your vision, 
anyway,” 'Relief congratulated him. 
“Now we have to be running along.” 
He looked thoughtfully at the local. 
“I really should shoot you . he 
said judiciously. 

“Sh . shoot me?” the Skwee- 
man gulped. “But I’ve got a couple 
of dozen chicks ready to break 
through the shell any day now! 
Those little devils will have the hide 
off the old lady in five minutes flat 



if I’m not there to protect her when 
they hatch out!” 

“On the other hand,” Retief went 
on, “I could give you a break.” 

“Yeah!” the Skweeman breathed. 
“Now you’re talking, Terry!” 

“You just carry on as though 
nothing had happened. We’ll go 
about our business and trouble you 
no more. I don’t think you’ll want 
to bother Uncle Lith by mentioning 
our departure; he might take the un- 
reasonable attitude that you’re in 
some way to blame. Just play them 
close to your medals and act inno- 
cent when they notice the cell’s emp- 
ty.” 

“You bet, boss. I always knew you 
Terries were gents. Between us, I 
never went much for that two4egged 
slicker — ” 

“Mind your derogatory references 
to the number of a being’s limbs, 
sir,” Magnan said stiffly. “Two legs 
appears to me to be an admirable 
endowment of such members.” 

“Sure, no offense, gents. Now, 
how’s about beating it quick, before 
somebody comes along? And you 
better give me back my gun. Some- 
body might get nosy if I don’t have 
it.” 

Retief ejected the power cylinder 
from the butt of the gun, dropped it 
into his pocket, handed the empty 
weapon over. 

“We can’t reach the car,” he said 
to Magnan. “They towed it away to 
tinker with at leisure. We’ll have to 
ease out the back way and see how 
far we get.” 

Keeping to the narrow alley, Re- 
tief and Magnan safely traversed a

emerged at the end of a long ave- 
nue that meandered down a slope to- 
ward the mile-distant fence marking 
the South Skweeman border, barely 
visible now in the late twilight. 

“If there were just some way to 
cover that ghastly open stretch,” 
Magnan muttered, “we could be 
safe in a matter of minutes . • 

He broke off, pointed at a flickering 
glow, a smudge of smoke rising laz- 
ily from a point near the gate where 
the road crossed the internation^ 
line. “What’s that? Dust, perhaps? 
Or smoke?” 

“The wind’s from the north,” Re- 
tief said. “And there’s nothing but 
twenty miles of dry mud-wheat 
between here and those haystacks 
housing our friends, the South Skweo- 
man leaders. Something tells me 
that’s a fire, Mr. Magnan — and not 
an accidental one.” 

“Fire?” Magnan gasped. “Great 
heavens, Retief — the capital is di- 
rectly down-wind! They’ll be roast- 
ed alive — the Ambassador, the 
staff, the South Skweemans — and 
no water anywhere to fight the 
blaze!” 

“That’s one way of influencing an 
election,” Retief pointed out. 

“Why, , there’s nothing to keep it 
from burning off the prairie all the 
way to the sea,” Magnan blurted. 
“The entire country will be incin- 
erated! There’ll be nothing left of 
oui; allies but a pall of smoke!” 

There was a scratchy Skweeman 
shout from behind the Terrans. They 
tui'ned to see a policeman approach- 
ing up the alley on the run — a spec- 
tacle not unlike a cubic yard of 
olive-drab noodles rolling up-hill. 



“Let’s go,” Retief sna.pped. He 
turned and ran for it, with Magnan 
pelting at his heels and a gathering 
force of pursuers baying on the trail. 

4 4Tt’s . no . use,” Magnan 

X gasped as they toiled up the 
last hundred yards toward the 
mighty flank of the dam. “They’re 
. gaining.” He cast a look back 
at the mob of half a hundred North 
Skweeman patriots strung out in a 
torch-waving line halfway to the 
village. 

“Just a little farther.” Retief 
caught Magnan ’s arm and hauled 
him along. “You’re doing fine.” 

They reached the top of the dam, 
massive and ominous in the dark- 
ness. A blaster bolt crackled blue 
nearby, from extreme range. 

“Retief, we’re not going to cross 
thatr Magnan stared in horror at 
the narrow unrailed catwalk that led 
out to disappear in darkness, the 
great black void on one side, the lap- 
ping waters slapping at the concrete 
on the other. 

“Unless we want to be shot, we 
are.” Retief started out at a trot. 
Magnan bleated, then followed, 
edging along flat-footed. Another 
shot chipped concrete behind him. 
He yelped and broke into a nervous 
caniter. 

They reached the far side, scram- 
bled up the dry slope, lit only by 
the blasters that peppered them with 
flying gravel as the shots struck 
around them. 

“Where are they?” a Skweeman 
voice sounded. “I can’t see a thing; 
those Terries must have eyes like 
a weenie-bugl”

“Lights,” someone else called. 
“Don’t let ’em get away, boys!” 

Retief stood, cupped his hands 
beside his mouth. 

“Lith,” he called. “A word of 
advice: don’t light up!” 

“We can’t . hide here,” Mag- 
nan gasped out. “No cover . and 
those shots . getting close!” He 
dived flat as a shot kicked up dirt 
almost at his feet. 

“They won’t find us in the dark,” 
Retief said. 

“But — they’ll switch on the 
lights.” 

“There is that chance — but they 
were warned.” 

There was a shock through the 
ground that bounced both men three 
inches into the air. Then a deep- 
throated tooom! rolled from the 
abyss like chained thunder, as bril- 
liant light flooded the entire length 
of the dam. 

Retief raised his head, saw great 
chunks of masonry rising with lan- 
guid grace high in the air. Atop the 
stricken dam, the few bold Skwee- 
mans who had started across dith- 
ered momentarily, then pelted for 
safety as the walkway subsided with 
dream-like m.fijcsty under them. Most 
of them reached the far side as the 
immense bulk of the dam cracked 
with a boom like a cannon; the rest 
dived for the glistening surface of 
the pent-up water, splashed desper- 
ately for shore as dust boiled up 
from the gorge, obscuring the sc«ne 
of destruction. 

Polyarcs still blazing bravely, the 
great dam crumbled, sinking from 
sight. Wave after wave of sound 
rolled across the slope. Rocks and 



pebbles thudded down near the 
diplomats. They gained their feet, 
sprinted for the top of the hill, then 
turned, watched as the surface of 
the artificial lake heaved, recoiling 
ponderously from the blast, then 
bulged toward the broached dam, 
formed a vast spout like translucent 
black syrup that arched^ out, out, 
over, and spilled down, foaming 
white now, plunging into the boiling 
dust. The ground shook as the in- 
calculable tonnage of water struck 
far below. A roaring like caged din- 
osaurs bellowed upward from the 
gorge as the river poured back into 
its bed in a torrent that shredded 
concrete and steel from the broken 
rim of the dam like water dissolving 
dry mud. In a scant five minutes, 
nothing remained of the Great Groa- 
ci Dam but the denuded abutments, 
studded with the stripped ends of 
clustered reinforcing rods. 

“Relief!” Magnan piped over the 
roar of the waters. “The ... the 
dam broke!” 

Retief nodded judiciously. “Yes, 
Mr. Magnan,” he said. “I think you 
could say that.”

R etief and Magnan waded past 
the tattered remains of the 
tattered remains of the soggy huts 
thrusting up from the swirling, mud- 
brown waters that covered the site 
of the South Skweeman capital, in- 
undated by the flood that had swept 
down so abruptly an hour earlier. 
Ambassador Treadwater stood with 
his staff before the remains of the 
Chancery hut, waist deep in the flow.

“Ah, there you are, Magnan.” He 
turned to look disapprovingly at 
the new arrivals. “Remind me to 
speak to you about punctuality. I’d 
almost begun to wonder if you’d 
met with foul play. Even considered 
sending someone after you.” 

“Mr. Ambassador — about all this 
water — ” 

“Hark!” Someone raised a hand 
torch, shot its blue-white beam out 
across the water, picked up the low 
silhouette of an inflated dinghy on 
which a number of bedraggled, 
knobby-kneed Groaci crouched. Sev- 
eral Skweemans splashed forward to 
intercept the craft. 

“Well, nice of you to drop in, my 
dear Shish,” Treadwater called. 
“Most unfortunate that your engi- 
neers have apparently proved un- 
equal to their task. Possibly their 
slide-rules were out of adjustment. 
Still their timing was good, confla- 
grationwise.” 

He smiled sourly as the staff 
chuckled dutifully. 

“Bah, the design was flawless,” 
Shish whispered as the raft bobbed 
on the ripples. “We were sabotag- 
ed!” 

“Sabotage?” Treadwater surveyed 
the Groaci Ambassador as haught- 
ily as his sodden puce cutaway would 
allow. “I think you are as aware as 
I that impK>rt of explosives to an 
emergent planet like Skweem is quite 
impossible, but for certain industrial 
types allocated to massive engineer- 
ing projects.” 

“You suggest that Groaci deto- 
nants were employed in this dastard- 
ly fashion? Why, the very idea . 
Shish fell sulkily silent. 



“Confidentially, Retief,” Magnan 
whispered behind his hand, “Just 
what do you suppose did happen to 
the dam?” 

“Possibly someone got their wires 
crossed,” Retief murmured. 

“Now, Mr. Ambassador,” Tread- 
water said. “I fear I shall have to 
expropriate your conveyance for of- 
fidal CDT use. I find it necessary 
to remove to my hill station at once 
to prepare my dispatches.” He broke 
off as a muddy scarecrow faindy 
recognizable as the Agricultural At- 
tache splashed up to join the group. 

“Did you notice the current 
change, Mr. Ambassador?” he cried 
gaily. “The water’s draining back 
into the river bed now — and the 
new channel cut by the flood runs 
just this side of the border. I fancy 
we’ll have no more interference from 
these meddlesome Groaci — oh, it’s 
Ambassador Shish,” he nodded to 
the sodden dignitary. “Nice night. 
Your Excellency.” 

“Bah,” Shish replied. 

The attache was rubbing his hands 
together. “My preliminary study 
seems to indicate that the inunda- 
tion has deposited a good six inches 
of new topsoil over a large portion 
of South Skweem. All scoured off 
Northern Skweem, of course, but 
then, they will allow defective dams 
to be built on their land . .” His 
voice trailed off. He pointed across 
the rapidly receding waters. Amid 
much splashing, a large party of 
Skweemans was approaching at a 
rapid clip. 

“Gad!” Colonel Pluckwyn 
boomed. “We’re being invaded!” 

“Here, do something!” Treadwater 

IF

turned to Shish. “They’re your al- 
lies! Tell them to go along quietly 
and we’ll see about a handsome 
CDT reparation for any inconven- 
ience — ” 

“I claim sanctuary!” Shish whis- 
tled in agitation. “Treadwater, it’s 
your duty to protect me and my 
chaps from these soreheads!” 

“They do appear somewhat 
irate.” Magnan began backing away. 

“Don’t lose your heads, gentle- 
men!” Treadwater croaked. “We’ll 
demand the privileges of honorable 
prisoners of war — ” 

“We haven’t lost, yet,” Retief 
pointed out. 

“An excellent point, Mr. Retief.” 
The Ambassador reached for the 
Groaci raft. “I hereby appoint you 
as a special committee to meet with 
these fellows and study their griev- 
ances. If you can drag the talks out 
for an hour, the rest of us will go 
for help.” 

“Quite an honor, my boy,” Col- 
onel Pluckwyn said, as he tumbled 
a faintly protesting Groaci over the 
side. “And you merely a Second 
Secretary.” 

“I don’t think we should do any- 
thing hasty,” Retief said. “Now that 
the North Skweemans have had a 
taste of , Groaci sponsorship, they 
may be ready for our program.” 

Councillor Lith, showing signs of 
wear and tear, surfaced beside Ret- 
ief, having been replaced by a Ter- 
ran aboard the raft. “Some day, 
Terry, the truth of this affair will 
out,” he hissed in faint Groaci fer- 
ocity. 

“Why be pessimistic?” Retief re- 
sponded. “If you play your cards 



right, the North Skweemans may 
never learn that the dam was placed 
so that when the basin was full you 
could open the flood gates and wipe 
out their capital along with anything 
that might have been left of South 
Skweem, leaving an open field for a 
Groaci take-over.” 

“What? Are you suggesting — ” 
“I’d suggest dawn as a reasonable 
deadline,” Retief went on. “If you 
wade along with Ambassador Tread- 
water, you can get off a ’gram and 
have a ship in here to pick you up 
by then. I can’t guarantee that I can 
keep it quiet much longer than 
that.” 

“Hey!” Dimplick shouted sudden- 
ly. “Look at the placard they’re 
waving!” Retief glanced toward the 
approaching North Skweemans, com- 
ing up rapidly now. 

“Why, those appear to be hastily 
lettered pro-Terry slogans,” the Po- 
litical Officer burst out. 

“Have you lost your wits?” Tread- 
water rumbled. He peered through 
the gloom. “Hmmm. It appears 
you’re right.” He straightened his 
back. “Just as I expected, of course. 
I knew that my policies toward 
these fellows would bear fruit, given 
time.” He shot Magnan a reproving 
look. “A pity you chose to go junk- 
eting just at the climactic point of 
the finesse. You missed a valuable 
lesson in diplomatic sublety.” 
Magnan opened his mouth, caught 
a look from Retief, closed it again. 

“I’m sure we were all fooled by 
Your Excellency’s apparent total in- 
activity, sir,” he gulped. 

“Exactly.” Treadwater beamed 
around at the others as the front- 



DAM NUISANCE

runners of the North Skweeman 
delegation arrived, uttering cries of 
delight and pledging eternal friend- 
ship. “It appears we’ll have a solid 
electorate behind us, gentlemen! My 
job — that is to say, the future of 
Terran-Skweeman relations seems 
secure. Now, if we just had an ad- 
equate Project Proposal to offer 
Sector Headquarters, our cup would 
be brimming.” He stepped forward, 
began shaking members left to right. 
“Sir!” Secretary Dimplick bounded 
forward. “I’ve a dandy notion! Why 
not build a new capital for United 
Skweem to replace the former city 
swept away by the flood?” 

“Of course!” Colonel Pluckwyn 
chimed in. “My idea exactly; just 
waiting for an appropriate moment 
to mention it. I’d also suggest a 
massive aid program to rectify the 
other ravages of the disaster.” 

“Food!” the Agricultural Attache 



shouted. “1 think I can justify a 
schedule of deliveries under the 
Chrunchies for Lunchies program 
that will keep two dozen Corps bot- 
toms in use for the next fiscal quar- 
ter!” 

“Superb, gentlemen!” Treadwater 
warbled. “I can see promotions all 
around — to say nothing of extra 
staff, monuments to Skweeman in- 
dependence and democratic solid- 
arity, larger operational budgets, and 
a magnificent new Ter^an Chancery 
rising from the ruins!” 

“Say, Mr. Retief.” The junior 
Third Secretary plucked at his 
sleeve. “I thought these North 
Skweemans were little better than 
dacoits and brigands; suddenly 
they’re welcomed as bosom friends.” 

“True, they’re a shifty lot,” Retief 
confided as he accepted a moist 
Skweeman handshake. “But who are 
we to be choosy?” END

Right trusty and well-beloved 
Hugo Edward Lack 

GREETINGS 

By the power and duties invest- 
ed in me as First Secretary to 
the Space Navy of Earth you 

are , . 

E ven when y6u know you are go- 
ing to be kicked in the stom- 
ach the boot still hurts. 

Hugo Edward Lack read no more. 
The crisp official letter crumpled 
damply in his fingers. His bowels 
felt loose and he wanted to be sick. 

He glanced guiltily across the 
wide low-ceilinged apartment room 
aswim with gaudy reflected color 
from the tridi in front of which

his mother sat absorbed in a mere- 
tricious pseudo-life. One plump hand 
cradled a chocolate box, the other 
primped fussily at her mouth. As 
usual, nothing would disturb his 
dear mama until dinner time. 

“Fve ben conscripted to fight for 
the likes of your said Lack vicious- 
ly. He wadded the call-up notice 
and flung it from him as though 
to disassociate himself from its im- 
plications. For Lack knew what was 
in store for him. 

How many times he had enacted 
this scene in his mind’s eye he could 
not compute. Once, even, he had 
madly imagined his mother dissolv- 
ing in tears and flinging her arms 
around him, ready to defy the Ter- 
ran Space Navy for her boy. 

Lack’s fertile brain began schem- 



83 



ing. Of course they would get the 
call-up notice to him through the 
ordinary postal channels. They 
would have proof he had received 
it through the automatic receipt 
system. But they had to lay physical 
hands on him before they could be 
sure he would docilely enter the 
slaughter house. Lack had long since 
made up his mind that no power of 
this Solar Federation would get him 
into a spacenavy man’s uniform and 
send him off into the inhuman 
depths of space to fight either Tak- 
kat or Shurilala. 

Jerky Jones should still be the 
man. He had conveyed in his twitch- 
ing way his willingness to assist any- 
one at all who deserved it. That is 
to say, anyone with the money to 
pay — to avoid call-up. Draft-dodging 
had become big business. 

No longer was it enough to be 
married, or to hold a permit to read 
for a degree, or even to possess 
some slight skill in a reserved oc- 
cupation. For in this seventeenth 
year of the hideous TEST war — the 
fledgling combat among the stars of 
the three empires of Takkat, Shur- 
ilala and Earth— resources had been 
drawn on until even the seams of 
the bucket were being dismantled 
and processed for spatial warfare, 

H ugo Edward Lack did not want 
to fight ^ aliens. He did not 
want to don the proud uniform of 
the Terran Space Navy and fare 
forth on singing jets among the 
stars, shooting at aliens — and being 
shot; did not want to cash in on the 
current market trade-in value of one 
medal for one limb — or the big one' 



if you never came home. He wanted 
to stay in his own little world and 
try to catch the happiness that al- 
ways eluded him. 

These were all very human de- 
sires on Lack’s part; the natural 
aversion of any man to having por- 
tions of his anatomy shot away, to 
asphyxiate in a star battleship with 
the seams cracked open to the hun- 
gry nothingness, the blood boiling in 
his brain and steaming from his 
eyes. 

Oh, sure, Hugo Edward ‘Lack was 
afraid. 

He had every right to be. 

But in this seventeenth year of the 
insane conflict many men, although 
more afraid than ever Lack could 
fathom, volunteered to fight in 
space. They had discovered a truth 
that Hugo Edward would not admit 
existed. So now the boy planned and 
schemed ways to cheat the Draft 
Board without injuring himself. 

As he left the room his mother 
picked up another chocolate, mo- 
mentarily drawn from the tridi by 
some other movement in the room 
that impinged with faint impression 
on her consciousness. Then she 
popped the candy into her mouth 
and relapsed once more into the 
viewers’ coma. 

Jerky Jones welcomed young 
Lack with a smile and an out- 
stretched hand, a business as usual 
briskness. 

Jones twitched all the time. He 
explained casually that he’d never 
fully recovered from that time his 
destroyer had been caught in a full 
salvo by a Takkatian cruiser off 
Oban II. He never admitted that he 



84 



IF 




had never been in the spacenavy and 
the twitches came from a more 
mundane criminal reason. Now he 
welcomed Hugo Edward Lack like 
an old buddy, pulling up a stool to 
the bar in his crosstown dive, or- 
dering a drink, smiling widely, one 
hand draped across the boy’s shoul- 
ders like a comforting Father Christ- 
mas. 

“You said — that is — ” gulp — 
“you could help me.” 

“Sure, kid. Sure! Any time.” The 
hard eyes took in Lack’s trembling 
figure, the scrawny body and thin 
bony wrists, the uncertain Adam’s 
apple, the weak plea for understand- 
ing in the murky eyes. “Sure. 
Called up, hey?” 

“I’m not going! They can’t make 
me! If my old man had been alive, 
he’d have stopped them.” 

“Your mom ain’t bothered?” 
“Her!” Lack shook at a lifetime’s 
memories. “She couldn’t wait to run 
out on my old man. When he went 
over the cliff in his car she dialed 
the bank. Her!” 

Jones rose from his seat and, 
jiggling, led the way through to a 
back room. Here he told Lack to 
sit down, his voice jabbing sudden- 
ly like an unexpected splinter in a 
handrail. “Siddown, kid, and 
watch.” 

L ack sat, frightened anew, ap- 
prehensive of the immediate 
moment. The fear of space had 
grown in him over the years, fed by 
newsreels and stories from the fronts 
until it had assumed the guise of an 
ever-present dream nightmare, an 
inward landscape lividly illuminated 



by the fire of broken spaceships and 
the glow of burning cities. 

“Look at the screen. No tridi. 
Duodimensional is enough for this.” 
Lack watched, shaking. 

The screen showed a man with 
one arm replaced by a prosthetic 
limb that rapidly and dexterously 
manipulated complex equipment. 

“TTiat’s no good any more. Nor 
arc feet and legs. They kin fit a 
prosthetic limb better’n the one I’d 
chop off.” 

Lack choked. 

The frame shifted. A youth sat 
in a chair, drooling, fed by a nurse; 
he regurgitated and lolled and 
messed all down his plastic bib. 

‘They got wise to that one. What- 
ever I do to your brain they’ll undo, 
if it’s on a temporary basis. That 
feller wanted a permanent. When I’d 
finished with him he couldn’t be put 
back arights. He’s never going into 
space, though.” 

“No!” 

“You can’t be too squeamish, son, 
if you want out.” 

“But surely there is another way! 
A false identity, that’s all I want! 
Cards, ident ticket — you know.” 
Jones chuckled cruelly. “Sure 1 
know. I ain’t gonna say it can’t be 
done. You know the ident check- 
outs they have now. Every single 
human being is tabbed. No — I 
won’t say it can’t be done — of 
course it’s been done — ^but you don’t 
have that kind of money, kid.” 
“How much?” 

“Don’t waste my time. Look — I 
can screw your insides around, fix 
it so’s you can’t keep Navy rations 
down. They’ll refix you up; but it’ll

85 




take time. And this fool war can’t 
go on much longer.” 

“Does it—” Lack wiped his lips 
— “does it hurt?” 

“Well, of course it hurts! You 
can’t monkey around with a man 
in this day and age and fix him so 
he’s a no good without it hurting! 
We’ve been hundreds of years breed- 
ing one hundred per cent fit human 
beings. And you want me to wind 
the clock back and turn out a four 
F in a coupla minutes!” 

“What about you — your — jerk- 
ing — ” 

“I’m a combat vet. They won’t 
touch me. I’m past the zone. My 
twitches have nothing to do with it. 
You don’t get twitches like these 
without being through the mill, 
son.” Jones leered. “I could fix a 
feller with false service records and 
twitches — but you ain’t got that kind 
of money.” 

“I heard a guy say you’d never 
been in the Navy, Jerky. He said 
your combat weariness came from 
drugs.” 

“I don’t want to hear no more of 
that! You want out of the service 
you pay the cash. Do I snarl up 
your guts or don’t I?” 

Lack rose unsteadily. “You know 
I’m straight out of engineering train- 
ing,” he said. The room kept jump- 
ing about and his eyes stung. “My 
mother keeps me, is all. I’ve saved 
a little—” 

“We could do this on the piece- 
meal basis. But in the end they’ll 
get you.” 

“What am I to doV 
“Pay me and I’ll screw you up. 
You haven’t enough for a perman- 



ent fix.” Jones shut off the screen. 
“Or you can be the big hero and go 
off with the bands and flags and 
join up. Suit yourself.” 

“But it hurts . .” 

“So?” 

“I’ll have to think about it.” 
“See you when you’ve made up 
your mind. I’m in no hurry. But 
remember — ” Jerky Jones leaned 
forward and his twitching nose 
pointed at Lack — “they’re in a 
hurry!” 

“Them! It’s always they! Who are 
they!” Lack turned blindly from the 
room, stumbling, hating what he 
could see within himself and yet 
quite unable to act otherwise. 

H e ran through the dark streets 
as a hunted animal runs. In 
truth, he was a hunted animal. 

The dark fantasies tortured his 
mind. He could maim himself but 
‘they’ would machine him into a 
stronger frame than he had had be- 
fore. He could blind himself and 
‘they’ would graft on new eyes. Jer- 
ky Jones could so manipulate his 
mind that he would reach the ter- 
minal zone of life while still a 
young man. He would never have to 
go into space then; he would end 
his days on a stool being fed gruel 
and slobbering it down his bib. 

“Perhaps,” he whispered. “Per- 
haps I could work myself a cushy 
billet. Maybe I could fix it so I’d 
be posted to a safe job on planet. 
I could try.” 

Fear has its own built-in determ- 
ining factors and its own inverted 
drive. 

As a boy he’d always been ner- 

IP 



86 




vous, of course, and his mother’s 
incurable nagging had eaten into the 
core of his persona so that he could 
not believe in himself as an individ- 
ual. He stayed isolated and aloof in 
a private, makebelieve world he 
created for himself, peopled with the 
adolescent fantasies he culled from 
dreams and magazines and books and 
the tridi. He gradually withdrew 
from the possibility of normal mean- 
ingful human relationships. He 
failed to believe that any human re- 
lationship could be normal. Every- 
thing from him clouded over with 
the belief in the meaninglessness of 
the universe, the frailty of his life 
and the eventual terminal entropy 
of humanity. 

His black distorted shadow gib- 
bered before him as his thin limbs 
jerked him down the street and a 
twin leering shadow pursued him as 
he fled. The po^’ce prowl car could 
not fail to spot him. The turbines 
whined low as the car cut across 
from an upper airlane and settled 
down plnmply before him. 

Lack could only just halt his legs, 
imbued as they were with this fierce 
fear-crazed desire to flee from ter- 
rors he knew too much about. His 
hands raked out across shining paint- 
work, his mouth v/orking, his lungs 
charging his body like a bellows. 

“Hey there, young feller. What’s 
all the rush?*’ 

Calm, square-faced men studied 
him as though their flash in truth 
impaled him like an insect on a pin. 

They knew, those policemen. 

They saw. 

They were gentle with him; but 
they took him just the same. 



Lack lolled in the back seat and 
slowly let his dissolving mind slip 
down easily and sweetly into a gray 
unconsciousness in which there 
could be no space and no terror. 

One policeman said: “Scared out 
of his wits about joining up. Been to 
see Jerky Jones for a fortune. 
Filth!” 

The other counterpointed in a 
lower key: “Jones would do noth- 
ing for him. No cash. We’ll pick 
Jones up one day — and when we 
do . .” 

“Filth,” said the first bitter voice 
again. “When I think of my bov 
dropping down with the Marines 
onto Sheldon III! My Ned dropping 
down into hell — ” 

“It easn’t easy to understand. But 
one day this war has to end. It’s got 
to. Even aliens must have the com- 
mon sense to see that.” 

The police prowl car flitted like a 
shadowy bat into police headquar- 
ters. But Hugo Edward Lack knew 
nothing of what happened to him 
until he awoke in a strange bunk 
with metal bulkheads pressing in, 
rust streaks fanning from boltheads, 
the light dim and heavily shielded, 
the smell of oil and stale air and 
human sweat pulsing in his nostrils 
to the rhythm of his labored breath- 
ing. 

Q uiet unemphatic men clad in 
space navy whites came for 
him. They took him before the cap- 
tain. Stupidly, Lack lolled before the 
desk, his eyes seeking reassurance 
from the decking at his feet and 
finding none. 

“Many men are frightened at 



DRAFT DODGER

what they imagine will happen to 
them in space, Lack.” The captain’s 
pouched eyes and furrowed, rav- 
aged face gave all the compassion 
the captain could feel for this pet- 
rified boy. The captain had passed 
the point at which he could lie to 
new recruits. As officer in charge 
of recruit training he could only feel 
thankful that his job did not en- 
compass the final awful indoctrin- 
ation of the stream of young men 
who passed through his hands. 

Lack was processed through Ter- 
ran Space Navy channels; given a 
clean white uniform and a little 
round crewman’s hat, categorized 
spaceman fourth class, inoculated 
and vaccinated and psychonated, 
given his kit and parted from all 
but a quarter inch of his hair. He 
was talked at, shouted at, drilled, 
ordered about, taught to salute an 
officer and on his own account 
learned to keep out of sight when 
hot on duty. All this happened to 
Lack in a gray haze. He tolerated 
the absolute invasion of his privacy 
only because his last garbled 
thoughts before the police prowl 
car caught up with him stuck like a 
faulty record in his mind, endlessly 
reverberating: “I can work myself 
a cushy billet. I can fix a safe job 
on a planet.” 

By this time he was not, evident- 
ly, the same. Hugo Edward Lack 
who had sought the dubious help of 
Jerky Jones. 

H e had managed to lift one frag- 
mentary corner of the new life 
awaiting him and he had survived. 
Life in the space navy might be 



toughening, coarse, sometimes brut- 
al, always demanding that a man 
pull out all the stops and prove he 
could do more than he thought he 
could, giving him no physical priv- 
acy but leaving his mind free to 
roam as it would during offnkity 
hours, this life might do all diese 
things; but it was still life. He 
breathed and ate and drank and 
knew himself to be a man. 

The fear had not been allayed, 
had not been slaked. The fear still 
existed as concretely as ever it had. 
But through the sheerly mechanical 
repetition of navy life the fear had 
been bypassed, almost tricked, put, 
as it were, into cold storage, dump- 
ed into suspended animation. 

Lack faced the world with a 
patinaed personality grafted onto 
him by the space navy. He did not 
fear to drill and to learn the ropes, 
to be told what to do and what not 
to do. In some routine way the 
fear of combat in space that had 
hag-ridden his dreams for so long 
had been pushed vaguely into a 
never-never future. He was in die 
navy — but, of course, he would 
never be called on to fight. 

T hey processed Lack on that most 
beautiful of alien worlds around 
swarming Cygnus, Charmian. 

On Charmian’s surface no one for 
a single instant would imagine them- 
selves to be on Earth; but Char- 
mian felt good and was a planet 
where a man could still remember 
Earth and yet feel the thrill of 
being on an alien world. Charmian 
soothed. 

“Details for posting,” said the 



IF 




captain one day when Lack had 
been, to his own surprise, re-graded 
spaceman third class. “You are all 
going to different training centers 
for final indoctrination.” The petty 
officers began calling out the names. 
The only one that mattered to 
Lack was: “S/man Third class, 

Lack, Hugo Edward. Lorimer. Assis- 
tant storekeeper.” 

Lorimer. 

Lack had never heard of the 
place. With the number of planets 
etCTnally orbiting their parent suns 
swimming in even this tiny sector 
of the Galaxy, that was not sur- 
prising. 

The shuttle dropped down from 
the transport, taking Lack onto a 
world stark and frozen, peaked and 
ridged, bathed in an atmosphere 
that would lacerate a man’s throat 
and flay his lungs. Lack took over 
his duties, accounting for the man- 
made mountains of stores in their 
neat warrens below the surface. He 
shut his mind to what lay on the 
surface and narrowed his whole at- 
tention to the stores. Some naive 
intuition told him, that way lay 
safety. 

On the surface Lorimer was a 
hell-planet. But Lack would not ven- 
ture onto the surface. And he was 
not in space, not aboard a battle- 
ship with his unpleasant and linger- 
ing evisceration in imminent pros- 
pect. 

Lorimer was of no real value to 
Earth until it had been terraformed 
into some semblance of terrestrial 
conditions and so was of no use 
either to Takkat or Shurilala; yet 
it was in the nature of this first 



TEST war when the three immature 
space empires stumbled into helpless 
interstellar war that it should be 
fought over and cherished merely 
because it was. As the only planet 
of a sun occupying a relatively 
empty portion of space Lorimer’s 
sole claim to fame lay in its use as 
a way station and refueling' and 
maintenance base. 

Lack counted engineering stores 
and kept his records and tried not 
to think too much. 

On the surface Lorimer flamed 
through spectacular sunsets when the 
drifting gas lent a blurred chiaros- 
cura overlay to the cruel peaks, 
when the whole planet lay bathed 
in dun ochreous luminosity. Lack 
would have none of this. He cower- 
ed, counting his stores in the deep- 
est recesses of the man-made shel- 
ter, thankful to be safe in the womb 
of the earth — even though this 
earth was not Mother Gaea. 

N ews of the battle reached the 
men on Lorimer whilst that 
great and terrible conflict still raged 
in the gulfs of space around the 
Crazy Suns and whispered reports 
of tragedy and victory fluttered like 
desiccated moths through the un- 
derground base. Apprehension stalk- 
ed the galleries. 

The medical officers made doubly 
sure that everyone took the little 
orange pills. Ostensibly a specific 
against extra-terrestrial claustropho- 
bia, they were well known to give 
courage and deaden fear, and Lack 
swallowed his down with a loving 
revulsion that science could take 
from him his basic feelings and by

treachery expose him to dangers his 
waking mind would shrink from. But 
for Lack even the orange pills could 
give no courage and no surcease 
from the fear that was a part of 
himself, for if that fear could be 
destroyed it would destroy Lack. 

The battle around the Crazy 
Suns went badly for the Terran 
Space Navy. Battered units spun 
wildly from that epicenter of vio- 
lence. Triumphantly and with bared 
fangs the wolves of Shurilala and 
Takkat hounded the men of Earth 
across the parsecs. 

On the seventh day Lieutenant 
Commander Paul Glinka, duty of- 
ficer, observed a closing bogey on 
the radar plot and alerted the opera- 
tions crew. The base on Lorimer 
prided itself on its speedy handling 
of ships and men; it was not geared 
to fight anything more lethal than 
a red-tape snarl-up in communica- 
tions. But, in keeping with any re- 
spectable Terran Navy base, it pos- 
sessed its quota of armaments. When 
the bogey turned out to be TSS 
Augusta, Lack was not alone in 
feeling a shivery crawl of relief. 

Augusta swept in from space too 
fast, grazed atmosphere, bounced, 
tried again, barreled smoking into 
the ochre desert of Lorimer a quar- 
ter of the way around the planet 
from the Terran base. 

The problem then presented to 
the base commander resolved itself 
simply^ into the decision to send a 
planetary flier out to pick up sur- 
vivors. Lieutenant Commander Glin- 
ka took off on that duty. As one 
of his crewmen went Hugo Ed- 
ward Lack. 



O f course. Lack did not really 
believe he had been sent on 
duty in a flier out over Lorimer’s 
surface. The triple turbines flung 
the aircraft across that dun mono- 
tonous surface, boosting to rise 
clear of razor peaks, howling on 
its mission of mercy. But Lack sat 
in his seat with his straps tightly 
buckled, surrounded by other men 
just as quickly snatched up from 
the base, refusing to believe he was 
where he was. 

Everyone knew that a Shurilala 
force had been following Augusta. 
If the rescue craft could carry out 
its job and return to the base be- 
fore the aliens arrived, all would be 
well. The base was camouflaged to 
avoid alien discovery. If they did 
not — oh, no! Hugo Edward Lack 
didn’t really believe he was at last 
facing the final accounting. 

The flier circled the stranded 
cruiser once, then flattened out and 
made a perfect landing. Piloting 
these planetary craft was child’s 
play; a matter of punching the right 
colored buttons to follow the se- 
quence of evolutions required. Red 
dust puffed fluffily as the jets died. 
The landing ladder extended, dural 
gleaming jaggedly under the alien 
sun. Clad in standard issue spacesuits 
the men disembarked. 

Augusta had been a light cruiser 
of the Heraklion class, swift and 
rapierlike; now she lay a crumpled 
mess looking like a heap of discard- 
ed tinfoil. From cracks fissuring her 
sides men in spacesuits had stagger- 
ed out, stood now dumbly waiting 
for the flier to carry them back to 
safety. 



90 



IF 




One of those dazed men was 
Harold Crespigny, civilian, historian 
attached to the Ninth Fleet. As the 
rescue went smoothly through its 
opening phases no one noticed that 
Lack had not stepped out with the 
others, that he remained cramped 
and knotted in his seat. 

Over the low-power limited radi- 
us suit sets Crespigny reported 
bleakly to Lieutenant Commander 
Glinka. 

“As a civilian, Commander, I 
want you to take care of the navy 
men first. They’ve had it pretty 
rough. There are more in the ship. 
We’ll need help with them.” 

Glinka motioned to his men. 
Stretchers were carried in — and 
with them went the grab bags for 
the dead. 

After that early futile episode with 
Jerky Jones there had been no dra- 
matics in Lack’s fear. He might 
have sat there in the flier until the 
rescue had been completed as he 
had sat through all that had happen- 
ed to him so far in the Navy, had 
not the radio spat its startled warn- 
ing. 

“Alert! Alert! Shurilala force now 
resolved as two Ogre class heavy 
cruisers. Landing seems contem- 
plated by use of jets. Effect rescue 
mission top priority . .” The young 
voice on the radio hesitated, then 
snapped back with a sharper bite: 
“As you were! Spread out and take 
cover! Do not attempt return! Keep 
out of sight!” 

Glinka’s hookup repeated the or- 
ders through his helmet phones. Men 
began to scatter away from the 
wrecked cruiser. Harold Crespigny 



moved with the others, saying: “I 
only hope their bombs hit the tar- 
get! Any band spread and we’ll 
catch a packet.” 

“Just so long as they don’t trace 
the base. We mustn’t give them an 
inkling we’re on this planet to stay.” 

N o one felt it necessary to men- 
tion the chances’ they were 
taking; a run for the base would 
bring the aliens down in fury and 
destruction on their necks so all they 
could do was take cover and hope 
the Shurilala would not use nuclear 
weapons. The chance was slight; 
but it existed. 

Glinka put it into panting words. 
“They’re out to smash up Augusta, 
so they won’t use N.P. bombs. But 
if they spot the base the N.P.’s will 
come down from a great height.” 
Lack heard the orders and he saw 
those running men. He felt detached 
from all that. He had to do one 
simple thing. He had to get back 
underground, to the cosy safety of 
the manmade base. It was very 
simple. No problem at all except he 
would have to hurry. 

He punched the firing pattern 
with only two errors and erases and 
the flier lifted off with a growling 
smother of red dust. Lack sat back 
in the pilot’s throne and thought 
about the forms he would have to 
fill in to cover the loss of equip- 
ment sustained this day. 

Jwst where the Takkatian needle- 
scout came from no one knew — 
either then or afterwards. Those 
jagged, tough, edgy men of Takkat 
always liked to bludgeon their way 
about space. She catapulted over 



DRAFT DODGER 



91 




the horizon, saw Lack’s flier and 
needled in lethally. 

Lack idly punched the evasive ac- 
tion buttons and went back to 
thinking about his forms. The flier 
jinked all over the sky followed by 
the Takkat scout. Rapidly they 
dwindled towards the far horizon 
— and straight towards the two 
Shurilalan Ogre class cruisers drop- 
ping down on thumping jets, their 
peculiar ring-mounted stability jets 
firing in unison, high and starkly 
visible against the bilious sky. 

To Crespigny, watching with the 
sweat clammy on him, those Shurila- 
la cruisers looked obscenely like 
fat cows, tails in the air, rumps 
flaunting, ready to squat and squash 
the life out of him. The Takkat did 
not hesitate for a microsecond; it 
is not in the nature of Takkatians 
to wait before jumping into a fight. 
The Shurilala are the smooth, cun- 
ning, devious aliens of the starlanes. 

The Takkat’s twin multi-cannon 
clipped out on outriggers, and like 
the needle for which the scout was 
named, she went straight in at the 
nearest Shurilala. Flames spread 
thickly in the soupy atmosphere; 
enormous discharges of electricity 
boiled off, the vast thunder of alien- 
created lightnings split the sky. 

The alien from far Takkat knew 
he had no chance against two crui- 
sers; but he was a Takkat and so he 
bored in with everything he had. He 
brewed ' up the first Shurilala and 
crippled the second in a shredding 



of metal and a flowering of flame- 
tipped debris even as his own craft 
dissolved into a shattered mass drip- 
ping ruin. 

Naturally enough there was noth- 
ing of Lack or his flier to be found 
anywhere. 

H arold Crespigny let out a long 
shaky sigh. “Lack, did you say 
his name was? Well, he didn’t lack 
guts. He sacrificed himself de- 
liberately to draw that Takkat onto 
the two Shurilala. He made the right 
decision and he made it fast.” 
Glinka shook his head wondering- 
ly. “I’d never have figured Lack 
for a hero type. But he surely saved 
all our skins today. Now we’d bet- 
ter call base and have them sort out 
what’s left of that Shurilala and 
pick us up.” 

The men of the Navy were not 
fools. If they suspected the real rea- 
sons behind Lack’s apparent suicidal 
heroism they did not voice them. 
Earth needed her heroes. The war 
machine had to be glamorized any 
way possible. If a lonely, frightened, 
almost paralyzed boy could fit that 
role — he would be elected a Hero 
of Terra. 

They sent the medal to his moth- 
er. She was watching tridi at the 
time and the medal slipped down 
behind the box of chocolates. “I 
always knew Huey was a good boy,” 
she said, munching a fresh candy. 
“I’ll pick up his medal as soon as 
this program is finished.” END

infirmary at Complex, staring up at 
a light and listening to a voice while 
a drug dipped into my veins. But 
was a hundred years ago, endless

pressure, pain. 

Knew now what no-end-is-up feel- 
ing was; had experienced before. 
Free fall. Was in space.

What Has Gone Before — 

We Lunarians have put up with a lot from Earth, but time comes 
when we don't v/ant to put up with more. Earth tells us what we can 
sell, who we sell it to, how much we can get for it. Means slavery. 

But . Earth owns us outright. Question is, what can we do 
about it? I don't mind a gamble — wouldn't mind fighting Earth with 
a chance to win — but with no chance, no. Luna has no warships. 
Earth has plenty, tuna has no armies. Earth has armies to burn. 

Most of all, Luna is run by big computer, and Earth owns the 
computer. 

But there's one thing Earth doesn't own — me. And it just so 
happens that I'm the fellow that fixes the computer . and the 
computer is my good friend I call Mike! 

So maybe — just maybe — we Lunarians can do something at last. 

So we invent mythical leader named "Adam Selene" — is really 
Mike — and start rolling. Only one problem: Need help on Earth. 
That's the hard one, because earthworms I don't know, neither does 
Mike, neither does any good Loonie. Don't know where to look . 
until chance delivers one into hands, when group of stilyagi kids ask 
permission to kill him. I save his life, never regret it. Name is Stuart 
LaJoie and is high-power VIP earthworm indeed. 

With him, revolution is good chance. But best chance comes when 
Company overplays hand. Couple guards rape girl, get killed — fight 
is on. Now somebody else has to go down to Earth, in cargo pod, like 
sack of wheat. 

Turns out "somebody" is me! 

What had gone wrong? Had Mike 
dropped a .decimal point? Or had he 
given in to childisih nature and play- 
ed a joke, not realizing would kill? 

Then why, after all the years of pain, 
was I alive? Or was I? Was this nor- 
mal way for ghost to feel, just lone- 
ly, lost, nowhere? 

“Wake up, Manuel! Wake up, 

Manuell’% 

“Oh, shut up!” I snarled. “Button 
your filthy king-and-ace!” Record- 
ing went on; I paid no attention. 

Where was that reeking light switch? 

No, doesn’t take a century of pain 
to accelerate to Luna’s escape speed 



at three gravities, merely feels so. 
Eighty- two seconds — but is one 
time When human nervous sytem 
feels every microsecond. Three gees 
is eighteen grim times as much as 
a Loonie ought to weigh. 

Then discovered those vacuum 
skulls had not put arm back on. For 
some silly reason they had taken it 
off when they stripped me to pre- 
pare me and I was loaded with 
enough don’t- worry and let’s-sleep 
pills not to protest. No huhu had 
they put it on again. But that dreck- 
lich switch was on my left and sleeve 
of p-suit was empty. 



94 



IF 





THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



Spent next ten years getting un- 
strapped Oflie hand, then a 

^w«n<ty-year seotemoe fk>aiting araund 
m dark before inaxtaged to find my 
Gstadte again, 6gfore out which was 
bead end and from that hint locate 
switch by tonch. That compartment 
was not over two meters in any di- 
mensioii. This turns out to be larger 
ilftiaii Old Dome in free fal and total 
darimess. Found it. We had light. 

(And don’t ask why that coffin 
did not have at least diree lighting 
systeans all working all time. Habit, 
probably. A lighting system implies 
a swd'tch to control it, nyet? Thing 
was built in two days; should be 
thankful switch work^.) 

Once I had light, cubic shrank to 
true daiustirophobic dimensions and 
ten per cent smaller, and I took a 
look at Prof. 

E>ead, apparently. 

Well, he had every excuse. Envied 
'him but was now supposed to check 
his pulse and breathing and suchlike 
in case he had been unlucky and still 
had such troubles. And was again 
hampered and not just by being one- 
armed. Grain load had been dried 
and depressured as usual before 
loading but that cell was supposed to 
^be pressured. CWi, nothing fancy, just 
a tank with air in it. Our p-suits were 
supposed to handle needs such as 
life’s breath for those two days. But 
even best p^suit is more comfortable 
in pressure than in vacuum and, 
anyhow, I was supposed to be able 
to get at my patient 

Could not. Didn’t need to open 
helmet to know this steel can had 
not stayed gas tight. Knew at once, 
naturally, from way p-suit felt. Oh, 



drugs I had for Prof, heart stimu- 
lants and so forth, were in field am- 
pules; could jab them through his 
suit. But 'how to ^ check heart and 
breaithmg? His suit was cheapest 
sort, sold for Loonde who rarely 
leaves warren; had no read-outs. 

Has mouth hung open aaid eyes 
steired. A deader, I decided. No need 
to ex Prof beyond that old limen; 
had eliminated himself. Tried to see 
pulse ou throat; his helmet was in 
way. 

T iey had provided a program 
dock, which was mighty kind 
of them. Showed I had be^ out 
forty^four-plus hours, all to plan, 
and in three hours we shoi^ re- 
ceive horrible booting to place us 
in parking orbit around Terra. Then, 
after two circums, call it three more 
hours, we sthould start injection into 
landing program — if Poona Ground 
Control didn’t change its feeble mind 
and leave us in orbit. Reminded self 
that was unlikely; grain is not left 
in vacuum longer than necessary. 
Has tendency to become puffed 
wheat or popped com, which not 
only lowers value, but can split ^ose 
thin canisters like a melon. Wouldn’t 
that be sweet? Why had they packed 
us in with grain? Why not just a 
load of rock that doesn’t mind vac- 
uum? 

Had time to think about that and 
to become very thirsty. Took nipple 
for half a mouthful, no more, be- 
cause certain'ly did not want to take 
six gees with a full bladder. (Need 
not have worried; was equipped with 
catheter. But did not know.) 

When time got short I decided 



96 



IF 




couldn’t hurt Prof to give him a jo'lt 
of drug that was supposed to take 
him through heavy acceleration, 
then, after in parking orbit, give him 
heart stimulant — since didn’t seem 
as if anything could hurt him. 

Gave him first drug, then spent 
rest of minutes struggling back into 
straps, one-fhanded. Was sorry I 
didn’t know name of my helpful 
friend; coorid have cursed him better. 

Ten gees gets you into parking 
orbit around Terra in a mere 3.26x 
10'^ microseconds; merely seems 
longer, ten gravities being sixty times 
what a fragile sack of protoplasm 
should be asked to endure. Call it 
thirty-three seconds. My truthful 
word, I suspect my ancestress in Sa- 
lem spent a worse half minute day 
they made her dance. 

Gave Prof heart stimulant, then 
spent three hours trying to decide 
whether to drug self as well as Prof 
for landing sequence. Decided 
against. All drug had done for me 
at catapulting had been to swap a 
minute and a half of misery and 
two days of boredom for a century 
of terrible dreams — and besides, 
if those last minutes were going to 
be my very last, I decided to ex- 
perience them. Bad as they would 
be, they were my very own and I 
would not give them up. 

They were bad. Six gees did hot 
feel better than ten; felt worse. Four 
gees no relief. Then we were kicked 
harder. Then suddenly, just for 
seconds, in free fall again. Then 
came splash which was not “gentle” 
and which we took on straps, not 
pads, as we went in head first. Also, 
don’t thinik Miike realized that, after 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRKS 



diving in hard, we would then sur- 
face and splash hard again before 
we damped down into floating. 
Earthworms call it “floating” but is 
nothing like floating in free fall; you 
do it at one gee, six times what is 
decent, and odd side motions tacked 
on. Very odd motions — Mike had 
assured us that solar weather was 
good, no radiation danger inside that 
Iron Maiden. But he had not been 
so interested in Earthsdde Indian 
Ocean weatther; prediction was ac- 
ceptable for landing barges and sup- 
pose he felt that was good enough — 
and I would have thought so, too. 

Stomach was supposed to be emp- 
ty. But I filled helimet with sourest, 
narstiest fluid you would ever go a 
long way to avoid. Then we turned 
completely over and I got it in hair 
and eyes and some ki nose. This is 
thing earthworms call “seasickness” 
and is one of many horrors they 
take for granted. 

W on’t go into long period dur- 
ing which we were towed into 
port. Let it stand that, in addition 
to seasickness, my air bottles were 
playing out. They were rated for 
twelve hours, plenty for a fifty-hour 
orbit most of which I was uncon- 
scious and none invoilving heavy 
exercise, but not quite enough with 
some hours of towing added. By 
time barge finally held sti‘ll I was 
almost too dopy to care about try- 
ing to break out. 

Except for one fact. We were 
picked up, I think, and tumibled a 
bit, then brought to rest with me 
upside down. 

This is a no-good position at best 

97 




under one gravity; simply impossible 
wihen supposed to (a) unstrap self, 

(b) get out of suit-shaped cavity, 

(c) get loose a sledge hammer fast- 
ened with butterfly nuts to bulk- 
head, (d) smash same against break- 
aways guarding escape hatch, (e) 
batter way out and (f) finally, drag 
an o*ld man in a p-suit out after you. 

Didn’t finis*h step (a); passed out 
head downwards. 

Lucky this was emergency-last- 
resort routine. Stu LaJoie had been 
notified before we left; news services 
had been warned shortly before we 
landed. I woke up with people lean- 
ing over me, passed out again, woke 
up second time in hospital bed, flat 
on back with heavy feeling in chest 
— was heavy and weak all over — 
but not i'll, just tired, bruised, hun- 
gry, thirsty, languid. Was a transpar- 
ent plastic tent over bed which ac- 
counted for fact I was having no 
trouble breathing. 

At once was closed in on from 
both sides, a tiny Hindu nurse with 
big eyes on one side, Stuart LaJoie 
on other. He grinned at me. “Hi, 
coluber! How do you feel?” 

“Uh -. I’m right. But oh bloody! 
What a way to travel!” 

“Prof says it’s the only way. What 
a tough old boy he is.” 

“Hold it. Prof said? Prof is dead.” 
“Not at* all. Not in good shape — 
we’ve got him in a pneumatic bed 
with a round-the-clock watch and 
more instruments wired into him 
than you would believe. Buit he’s 
alive and will be able to do his job. 
But, truly, he didn’t mind the trip; 
he never knew about it, so he says. 
Went to sleep in one hospital, woke 



up in another. I thought he was 
wrong when he refused to let me 
wangle it to send a ship but he was 
not — the publicity has been tremen- 
dousr 

I said slowly, “You say Prof ‘re- 
fused’ to let you send a ship?” 

“I should say ‘Chairman Selene’ 
refused. Didn’t you see the dis- 
patches, Mannie?” 

“No.” Too late to fight over it. 
“But last few days have been busy.” 
“A dinkum word! Here, too. Don’t 
recall when last I dossed.” 

“You sound like a Loonie.” 

“I am a Loonie, Mannie, don’t 
ever doubt it. But the sister is looking 
daggers at me.” Stu picked her up, 
turned her around. I decided he 
wasn’t all Loonie yet. But nurse 
didn’t resent. “Go play somewhere 
else, dear, and I’ll give your patient 
back to you — stUl warm — in a few 
minutes.” He shut the door on her 
and came back to bed. “But Adam 
was right; this way was not only 
wonderful publicity but safer.” 
“Publicity, I suppose. But ‘safer’? 
Let’s not talk about!” 

4 4Qafer, my old. You weren’t shot 
at. Yet they had two hours 
i-n which they knew right where you 
were, a big fat target. They couldn’t 
make up their minds what to do; 
they haven’t formed a policy yet. 
They didn’t even dare not bring you 
down on schedule; the news was full 
of it, I had stories slanted and wait- 
ing. Now they don’t dare touch you, 
you’re popular heroes. Whereas if 
I had waited to charter a ship and 
fetch you . well, I don’t know. 
We probably would have been or-

dered into parking orbit; then you 
two — and myself perhaps — would 
have been taken off under arrest. No 
skipper is going to risk missiles no 
matter how much he’s paid. The 
proof of the pudding, cobber. But 
let me brief you. You’re both citi- 
zens of The People’s Directorate of 
Chad, best I could do on short no- 
tice. Also Chad has recognized Luna. 
I had to buy one prime minister, two 
generals, some tribal chiefs and a 
minister of finance — cheap for such 
a hurry-up job. I haven’t been able 
to get you diplomatic immunity but 
I hope to, before you leave hospital. 
At present they haven’t even dared 
arresit you; they can’t figure out 
what you’ve done. They have guards 
outside but simply for your ‘protec- 
tion’. And a good thing, or you 
would have reporters nine deep shov- 
ing microphones into your face.” 

“Just what have we done? — that 
they know about, I mean. Illegal 
immigration?” 

“Not even that, Mannie. You nev- 
er were a consignee and you have 
derivative PanAfrican citizenship 
through one of your grandfathers, 
no huhu. In Professor de la Paz’s 
case we dug up proof that he had 
been granted naturalized Chad cit- 
izenship forty years back, waited for 
the ink to dry and used it. You’re 
not even illegaMy entered here in 
India. Not only did they bring you 
down themselves, knowing that you 
were in that barge, but also a con- 
trol officer very Idndly and fairly 
cheaply stamped your virgin pass- 
ports. In addition to that. Prof’s ex- 
ile has no legal existence as the gov- 
ernment that proscribed him no long- 



er exists and a competent court has 
taken notice — that was more ex- 
pensive.” 

Nurse came back in, indignant as 
a mother cat. “Lord Stuart ... you 
must let my patient rest!” 

“At once, ma chere.” 

“You’re ‘Lord Stuart’?” 

“Should be ‘Comte.’ Or I can lay 
a dubious claim to being the Mac- 
gregor. The blueblood bit helps; 
these people haven’t been happy 
since they took their royalty away 
from them.” 

As he left he patted her rump. 
Instead of screaming, she wiggled it. 
Was smiling as she came over to me. 
Stu was going to have to watch that 
stuff when he went back to Luna. If 
did. 

She asked how I felt. Told her I 
was right, just hungry. “Sister, did 
you see some prosthetic arms in 
our luggage?” 

She had and I felt better with 
number-six in place. Had selected it 
and number-two and soda! arm as 
enough for trip. Number-two was 
presumably still in Complex; I hoped 
somebody was taking care of it. But 
number-six is most ah-around useful 
arm; with k and social one I’d be 
okay.

r vo days later we left for Agra 
to present credentials to Feder- 
ated Nations. 

I w>as in bad shape and not just 
high gee. Could do well enough in 
a wheel chair and could even walk 
a little although not in public. What 
I had was a sore throat that missed

pneumonia only through drugs, 
traveler’s trots, skin disease on hands 
and spreading to feet — just like my 
other trips to that disease-ridden 
hole, Terra. We Loonies don’t know 
how lucky we are, living in a place 
that has tightest of quarantines, al- 
most no vermin and wihat we have 
controlled by vacuum any time ne- 
cessary. Or unlucky, since we have 
almost no immunities if turns out 
we need them. Still, wouldn’t swap; 
never heard word “venereal” until 
first went Earthside and had thought 
“common cold” was state of ice 
miner’s feet. 

And wasn’t cheerful for other 
reason. Stu had fetched us a mes- 
sage from Adam Selene. Buried in 
k, concealed even from Stu, was 
news that chances had dropped to 
worse than one in a hundred. Won- 
dered what point in risking crazy 
trip if made odds worse? Did Mike 
really know what chances were? 
Couldn’t see any way he could com- 
pute them no matter how many facts 
he had. 

But Prof didn’t seem worried. He 
talked to platoons of reporters, 
smiled at endless pictures, gave out 
statements, telling world he placed 
great confidence in Federated Na- 
tions and was sure our just claims 
would be recognized and that he 
wanted to thank “Friends of Free 
Luna” for wonderful help in bring- 
ing true story of our small but sturdy 
nation before good people of Terra 
— F. of F.L. being Stu, a profession- 
al public opinion firm, several thou- 
sand chronic petition signers and a 
great stack of Hong Kong dollars. 

I had picture taken, too, and tried 



to smile, but dodged questions by 
pointing to throat and croaking. 

In Agra we were lodged in a lav- 
ish suite in hotel, that had once been 
palace of a maharajah (and still be- 
longed to him, even though India is 
supposed to be socialist) and inter- 
views and picture-taking went on. 
Hardly dared get out of wheel chair 
even to visit W.C. as was under or- 
ders from Prof never to be photo- 
graphed vertically. He was always 
either in bed or in a stretcher — 
bed baths, bed pans^ everything — 
not only because safer, considering 
age, and easier for any Loonie, but 
also for pictures. His dimples and 
wonderful, gentle, persuasive person- 
ality were displayed in hundreds of 
millions of video screens, endless 
news pictures. 

But his personality did not get us 
anywhere in Agra. 

Prof was carried to office of 
President of Grand Assembly, me 
being pushed alongside, and there 
he attempted to present his creden- 
tials as Ambassador to F.N. and 
prospective Senator for Luna. Was 
referred to Secretary General and 
at his offices we were granted ten 
minutes with assistant secretary who 
sucked teeth and said he could ac- 
cept our credentials “without prej- 
udice and without implied commit- 
ment.” They were referred to Cre- 
dentials Committee — who sat on 
them. 

I got fidgety. Prof read Keats. 
Grain barges continued to arrive at 
Bombay. 

I n a way was not sorry about lat- 
ter. WHien we flew from Bombay

to Agra we got up before dawn and 
were taken out to field as city was 
waking. Every Loonie has his hole, 
whether luxury of a long-established 
home like Davis Tunnels or rock still 
raw from drill; cubic is no problem 
and can’t be for centuries. 

Bombay has bee-swarms of 
people. Are over million (was told) 
who have no home but some piece 
of pavement. A family might claim 
right (and hand down by will, gener- 
ation after generation) to sleep on a 
piece two meters long and one wide 
at a described location in front of 
a' shop. Entire family sleeps on that 
space, meaning mother, father, kids, 
maybe a grandmother. Would not 
have believed if had not seen. At 
dawn in Bombay roadways, side 
pavements, even bridges are cov- 
ered with tight carpet of human 
bodies. What do they do? Where do 
they work? How do they eatl (Did 
not look as if they did. Could count 
ribs.) 

If I hadn’t believed simple arith- 
metic that you can’t ship stuff down- 
hill forever without shipping re- 
placement back, would have tossed 
in cards. But . tanstaafl. “There 
ain’t no such thing as a free lunch,” 
in Bombay or in Luna. 

At last we were given appointment 
with an “Investigating Committee.” 
Not what Prof had asked for. He 
had requested public hearing before 
Senate, complete with video cam- 
eras. Only camera at this session was 
its “in-camera” nature; was closed. 
Not too closed, I had little recorder. 
But no video Wanted us kept swept 
under rug. 

Nevertheless was chance to talk 



and Prof treated them as if they h^ 
power to recognize Luna’s Independ- 
ence and willingness to do so. While 
they treated us as a cross between 
naughty children and criminals up 
for sentencing. 

Prof was allowed to make open- 
ing statement. With decorations 
trimmed away was assertion that 
Luna was de-facto a sovereign state, 
with an unopposed government in 
being, a civil condition of peace and 
order, a provisional president and 
cabinet carrying on necessary func- 
tions but anxious to return to private 
life as soon as Congress completed 
writing a constitution — and that we 
were here to ask that these facts be 
recognized de jure and that Luna be 
allowed to take her rightful place in 
councils of mankind as a member of 
Federated Nations. 

What Prof told them bore a speak- 
ing acquaintance with truth as they 
were not where they could spot dis- 
crepancies. Our “provisional presi- 
dent” was a computer, and “cabinet” 
was Wyoh, Finn, Comrade Clay- 
ton and Terence Sheehan, editor of 
Pravda, plus Wolfgang Korsakov, 
board chairman of LuNoHoCo and 
a director of Bank of Hong Kong in 
Luna. But Wyoh was only person 
now in Luna who knew that “Adam 
Selene” was false face for a com- 
puter. She had been terribly nervous 
at being left to hold fort alone. 

As it was, Adam’s “oddity” in 
never being seen save over video 
was always an embarrassment. We 
had done our best to turn it into a 
“security necessity” by opening of- 
fices for him in cubic of Author- 
ity’s Luna City office and then ex- 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



101 




. ploding a small bomb. After this 
“assassination attempt” comrades 
who had been most fretful about 
Adam’s failure to stir around became 
loudest in demands that Adam must 
not take any chances— this being 
helped by editorials. 

But I wondered while Prof was 
talking what these pompous chooms 
would think if they knew that our 
“president” was a collection of hard- 
ware owned by Authority? 

B ut they just sat staring with chill 
disapproval, unmoved by Profs 
rhetoric. Probably best performance 
of his life, considering he delivered 
k flat on back, speaking into a mic- 
rophone without notes, and hardly 
able to see his audience. 

Then they started in on us. Gentle- 
man member from Argentina — 
never given their names; we weren’t 
socially acceptable — this Argentine 
objected to phrase “former War- 
den” in Prof’s speech. That designa- 
tion had been obsolete half a cen- 
tury; he insisted that it be struck 
out and proper title inserted: “Pro- 
tector of the Lunar Colonies by Ap- 
pointment of the Lunar Authority.” 
Any other wording offended dignity 
of Lunar Authority. 

Prof asked to comment; “Honor- 
able Chairman” permitted it. Prof 
said mildly that he accepted change 
since Authority was free to desig- 
nate its servants in any fashion it 
pleased and was no intention to of- 
fend dignity of any agency of Fed- 
erated Nations . but in view of 
functions of this office — former 
functions of this former office — 
citizens of Luna Free State would 



probably go on thinking of it by tra- 
ditional name. 

That made about six of them try 
to talk at once. Somebody objected 
to use of word “Luna” and still 
more to “Luna Free State” — it was 
“the Moon,” Earth’s Moon, a satel- 
lite of Earth and property of Fed- 
erated Nations, just as Antarctica 
was — and these proceedings were a 
farce. 

Was inclined to agree with last 
point. Chairman asked gentleman 
member from North ‘ America to 
please be in order and to address 
his remarks through chair. Did chair 
understand from witness’s last re- 
mark that this alleged de-facto re- 
gime intended to interfere with con- 
signee system? 

Prof fielded that and tossed it 
back. “Honorable Chairman, I my- 
self was a consignee, now Luna is 
my beloved home. My colleague, the 
Honorable the Undersecretary for 
Foreign Affairs Colonel O’Kelly 
Davis — ” myself! — “is Luna born, 
and proud of his descent from four 
transported grandparents. Luna has 
grown strong on your outcasts. Give 
us your poor, your wretched; we 
welcome them. Luna has room for 
them, nearly forty million square 
kilometers, an area greater than all 
Africa — and almost totally empty. 
More than that, since by our method 
of living we occupy not ‘area’ but 
‘cubic’ the mind cannot imagine the 
day when Luna would refuse another 
shipload of weary homeless.” 

Chairman said, “The witness is 
admonished to refrain from making 
speeches. The Chair takes it that 
your oratory means that the group 



102 



IF 




you represent agrees lo accept pris- 
oners as before.” 

“No, sir.” 

“What? Explain yourself.” 

“Once an immigrant sets foot on 
Luna today he is a free man, no 
matter what his previous condition, 
free to go where he listeth.” 

“So? Then what’s to keep a con- 
signee from walking across the field, 
climbing into another ship and re- 
turning here? I admit that I am 
puzzled at your apparent willing- 
ness to accept them . but we do 
not want them. It is bur humane 
way of getting rid of incorrigibles 
who would otherwise have to be 
executed.” 

(Could have told him several 
things that would stop what he pic- 
tured; he had obviously never been 
to Luna. As for “incorrigibles,” if 
really are, Luna eliminates such fas- 
ter than Terra ever did. Back when 
I was very young, they sent us a 
gangster lord, from Los Angeles I 
believe; he arrived with squad of 
stooges, his bodyguards, and was 
cockily ready to take over Luna, 
as was rumored to have taken over 
a prison somewhere Earthside. 

(None lasted two weeks. Gangster 
boss didn’t make it to barracks; 
hadn’t listened when told how to 
wear a'p-suit.) 

4 4ryAhere is nothing to keep him 
A from going home so far as 
we are concerned, sir,” Prof an- 
swered, “although your police here 
on Terra might cause him to think. 
But Fve never heard of a consignee 
arriving with funds enough to buy 
a ticket home. Is this truly an issue? 



The ships are yours; Luna has no 
ships — and let me add that we are 
sorry that the ship scheduled for 
Luna this month was canceled. I 
am not complaining that it forced 
on my colleague and myself — ” Prof 
stopped to smile — “a most informal 
method of travel. I simply hope that 
this does not represent policy. Luna 
has no quarrel with you. Ybur ships 
are welcome, your trade is welcome, 
we are at peace and wish to stay so. 
Please note that all scheduled grain 
shipments have come through on 
time.” 

(Prof did always have gift for 
changing subject.) 

They fiddled with minor matters 
then. Nosy from North America 
wanted to know what had really 
happened to “the Ward — ” He 
stopped himself. “The Protector. 
Senator Hobart.” Prof answered that 
he had suffered a stroke (a “coup” 
is a “stroke”) and was no longer able 
to carry out his duties — ^but was in 
good health otherwise and receiving 
constant medical care. Prof added 
thoughtfully that he suspected that 
the old gentleman had been failing 
for some time, in view of his indis- 
cretions this past year . especially 
his many invasions of ri^ts of free 
citizens, including ones who were 
not and never had been consignees. 

Story was not hard to swallow. 
When those busy scientists managed 
to break news of our coup, they 
had reported Warden as dead . 
whereas Mike had kept him alive 
and on job by impersonating him. 
When Authority Earthside demand- 
ed a report from Warden on this 
wild rumor, Mike had consulted 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



103 




Prof, then had accented call and 
given a convincing imitation of sen- 
ility, managing to deny, confirm and 
confuse every detail. Our announce- 
ments followed, and thereafter War- 
den was no longer available even in 
his computer alter ego. Three days 
later we declared independence. 

This North American wanted to 
know what reason they had to be- 
lieve that one word of this was 
true? Prof smiled most saintly smile 
and made effort to spread thin 
hands before letting them fall to 
coverlet. “The gentleman member 
from North America is urged to go 
to Luna, visit Senator Hobart’s sick- 
bed and see for himself. Indeed all 
Terran citizens are invited to visit 
Luna at any time, see anything. We 
wish to be friends, we are at peace, 
we have nothing to hide. My only 
regret is that my country is unable 
to furnish transportation; for that 
we must turn to you.” 

Chinee member looked at Prof 
thoughtfully. He had not said a word 
but missed nothing. 

Chairman recessed hearing until 
fifteen hundred. They gave us a re- 
tiring room and sent in lunch. I 
wanted to talk but Prof shook head, 
glanced around room, tapped ear. 
So I shut up. Prof napped then and 
I levelled out my wheel chair and 
joined him; on Terra we both slept 
all we could. Helped. Not enough. 

T ^cy didn’t wheel us back in un- 
til sixteen hundred; committee 
was already sitting. Chairman then 
broke own rule against speeches 
and made a long one more-in-sorrow- 
than-anger. 



Started by reminding us that 
Lunar Authority was a non-political 
trusteeship charged with solemn duty 
of insuring that Earth’s satellite the 
Moon — Luna, as some called it — 
was never used for military pur- 
poses. He told us that Authority had 
guarded this sacred trust more than 
a century, while governments fell 
and new governments rose, alliances 
shifted and shifted again. Indeed, 
Authority was older than Federated 
Nations, deriving original charter 
from an older international body, 
and so well had it kept that trust 
that it had lasted through wars and 
turmoils and realignments. 

(This is news? But you see what 
he was building towards.) 

“The Lunar Authority cannot sur- 
render its trust,” he told us solemnly. 
“However, there appears to be no 
insuperable obstacle to the Lunar 
colonists, if they show political ma- 
turity, enjoying a degree of auton- 
omy. This can be taken under ad- 
visement. Much depends on your 
behavior. The behavior, I should 
say, of all you colonists. There have 
been riots and destruction of prop- 
erty; this must not be.” 

I waited for him to mention ninety 
dead Goons. He never did. I will 
never make a statesman; I don’t 
have high-level approach. 

“Destroyed property must be paid 
for,” he went on. “Commitmenti 
must be met. If this body you call a 
Congress can guarantee such things, 
‘ it appears to this conmiittee that 
this so-called Congress could in 
time be considered an agency of tho 
Authority for many internal mat- 
ters. Indeed it is conceivable that a 



104 



IF 




stable local government might, in 
time, assume many duties now fall- 
ing on the Protector and even be 
allowed to have a delegate, non-vot- 
ing, in the Grand Assembly. 

“But one thing must be made 
clear. Earth’s major satellite, the 
Moon, is by nature’s law forever 
the joint property of all the peoples 
on Earth. It does not belong to that 
handful who by accident of history 
happen to live there. The sacred 
trust laid upon the Lunar Authority 
is and forever must be the supreme 
law of Earth’s Moon.” 

(“ — accident of history,” huh? I 
expected Prof to shove it down his 
throat. I thought he would say — 
No, never did know what Prof 
would say. Here’s what he did say:) 
Prof waited through several sec- 
onds of silence, then said, “Honor- 
able Chairman, who is to be exiled 
this time?** 

“What did you say?” 

“Have you decided which one of 
you is to go into exile? Your Dep- 
uty Warden won’t take the job” — 
this was true; he preferred to stay 
alive. “He is functioning now only 
because we have asked him to. If 
you persist in believing that we are 
not independent, then you must be 
planning to send up a new warden.” 
“Protector!” 

“Warden! Let us not mince words. 
Though if we knew who he is to be, 
we might be happy to call him ‘Am- 
bassador.’ We migiht be able to work 
with him. It might not be necessary 
to send with him armed hoodlums 
... to rape and murder our women!” 
“Order! Order! The witness wffl 
come to order!” 



“It is not I who was not in order, 
Honorable Chairman. Rape it was 
and murder most foul. But that is 
history and now we must look to 
the future. Whom are you going to 
exile?” 

Prof struggled to raise self on 
elbow and I was suddenly alert; was 
a cue. “For you all know, sir, that 
it is a one-way trip. I was born here. 
You can see what effort it is for me 
to return even temporarily to the 
planet which has disinherited me. 
We are outcasts of Earth who — ” 

He collapsed. Was up out of my 
chair — and collapsed myself, trying 
to reach him. 

Was not all play-acting even 
though I answered a cue. Is terrible 
strain on heart to get up suddenly 
on Terra; thick field grabbed and 
smashed me to floor.

N either of US’ was hurt and it 
made juicy news breaks, for I 
put recording in Stu’s hands and he 
turned it over to his hired men. Nor 
were all headlines against us; Stu 
had recording cut and edited and 
slanted. “AUTHORITY TO PLAY

Not all were good; nearest to a 
favorable story in India was editor- 
ial in NEW INDIA TIMES inquir- 
ing whether Authority was risking 
bread of masses in failing to come 
to terms with Lunar insurgents. Was

suggested that concessions could be 
made if would insure increased grain 
deliveries. Was filled with inflated 
statistics; Luna did not feed “a hun- 
dred million Hindus” — unless you 
chose to think of our grain as mak- 
ing difference between malnutrition 
and starvation. 

On other hand biggest New York 
paper opined that Authority had 
made mistake in treating with us at 
all, since only thing convicts under- 
stood was taste of lash. Troops 
should land, set us in order, hang 
guilty, leave forces to keep order. 

Was a quick mutiny, quickly sub- 
dued, in Peace Dragoons regiment 
from which our late oppressors had 
come, one started by rumor that 
they were to be shipped to Moon. 
Mutiny not hushed up perfectly; 
Stu hired good men. 

Next morning a message reached 
us inquiring if Professor de la Paz 
was well enough to resume discus- 
sions? We went, and committee sup- 
plied doctor and nurse to watch 
over Prof. But this time we were 
searched — and a recorder removed 
from my pouch. 

I surrendered it without much 
fuss; was Japanese job supplied by 
Stu — to be surrendered. Number- 
six arm has recess intended for a 
power pack but near enough size of 
my minirecorder. Didn’t need power 
that day— and most people, even 
hardened police officers, dislike to 
touch a prosthetic. 

Everything discussed day before 
was ignored . except that chair- 
man started session by scolding us 
for “breaking security of a closed 
meeting.” 



Prof replied that it had not been 
closed so far as we were concerned 
and that we would welcome news- 
men, video cameras, a gallery, any- 
one, as Luna had nothing to hide. 

Chairman replied stiffly that so- 
called Free State did not control 
these hearings. These sessions were 
closed, not to be discussed outside 
this room, and that it was so ordered. 

Prof looked at me. “Will you help 
me, Colonel?” I touched controls of 
chair, scooted around, was shoving 
his stretcher wagon With my chair 
toward door before chairman real- 
ized bluff had been called. Prof al- 
lowed himself to be persuaded to 
stay without promising anything. 
Hard to coerce a man who faints if 
he gets over-excited. 

Chairman said that there had been 
many irrelevancies yesterday and 
matters discussed best left undis- 
cussed — and that he would permit 
no digressions today. He looked at 
Argentino, then at North American. 

He went on: “Sovereignty is an 
abstract concept, one that has been 
redefined many times as mankind 
has learned to live in peace. We need 
not discuss it. The real question. 
Professor — or even Ambassador de- 
facto, if you like; we shan’t quibble 
— the real question is this: Are you 
prepared to guarantee that the Lunar 
Colonies will keep their commit- 
ments?” 

“What commitments, sir?” 

“All commitments, but I have in 
mind specifically y^ur commitments 
concerning grain shipments.” 

“I know of no such commitments, 
sir,” Prof answered with bland in- 
nocence. 



106 



IF 




C hairman’s hand tightened on 
gavel. But he answered quietly, 
“Come, sir, there is no need to spar 
over words. I refer to the quota of 
grain shipments — and to the in- 
creased quota, a matter of thirteen 
per cent, for this new fiscal year. Do 
we have your assurance that you 
will honor those commitments? This 
is a minimum basis for discussion, 
else these talks can go no further.” 
“Then I am sorry to say, sir, that 
it would appear that our talks must 
cease.” 

“You’re not being serious.” 

“Quite serious, sir. The sovereign- 
ty of Free Luna is not the abstract 
matter you seem to feel it is. These 
commitments you speak of were the 
Authority contracting with itself. My 
country is not bound by such. Any 
commitments from the sovereign na- 
tion I have the honor to represent 
are still to be negotiated.” 

“Rabble!” growled North Amer- 
ican. “I told you you were being too 
soft on them. Jail birds. They don’t 
understand^ decent treatment.” 
“Order!” 

“Just remember, I told you. If 
I had them in Colorado, we would 
teach them a thing or two.” 

“The gentleman member will 
please be in order.” 

“I’m afraid,” said Hindu mem- 
ber — Parsee in fact, but commit- 
teeman from India — “I’m afraid I 
must agree in essence with the gen- 
tleman member from the North 
American Directorate. Indian can- 
not accept the concept that the grain 
commitments are mere scraps of 
paper. Decent people do not play 
politics with hunger.” 



“And besides,” the Argentine put 
in, “they breed like animals. Pigs!” 

(Prof made me take a tranquiliz- 
ing drug before that session. Had 
insisted on seeing me take it.) 

Prof said quietly, “Honorable 
Chairman, may I have consent to 
amplify my meaning before we con- 
clude, perhaps too hastily, that these 
talks must be abandoned?” 

“Proceed.” 

“Unanimous consent? Free of in- 
terruption?” 

Chairman looked around. “Con- 
sent is unanimous,” he stated, “and 
the gentlemen members are placed 
on notice that I will invoke special 
rule fourteen at the next outburst. 
The sergeant-at-arms is directed to 
note this and act. The witness will 
proceed.” 

“I will be brief. Honorable Chair- 
man.” Prof said something in Span- 
ish; all I caught was “Senor.” Ar- 
gentine turned dark but did not 
answer. Prof went on, “I must first 
answer the gentleman member from 
North America on a matter of per- 
sonal privilege since he has impugn- 
ed my fellow countrymen. I for one 
have seen the inside of more than 
one jail; I accept the title — nay, I 
glory in the title of ‘jail bird.’ We 
citizens of Luna are jail birds and 
descendants of jail birds. But Luna 
herself is a stern school mistress; 
those who have lived through her 
harsh lessons have no cause to feel 
ashamed. In Luna City a man may 
leave purse unguarded or home un- 
locked and feel no fear ... I won- 
der if this is true in Denver? As may 
be, I have no wish to visit Colorado 
to learn a thing or two; I am satisfied

with what Mother Luna has taught 
me. And rabble we may be, but we 
are now a rabble in arms. 

‘To the gentleman member from 
India let me say that we do not ‘play 
politics with hunger.’ What we ask 
is an open discussion of facts of 
nature unbound by political assump- 
tions false to fact. If we can hold 
this discussion, I can promise to 
show a way in which Luna can con- 
tinue grain shipments and expand 
them enormously ... to the great 
benefit of India.” 

B oth Chinee and Indian looked 
alert. Indian started to speak, 
checked himself, then said, “Honor- 
able Chairman, will the chair ask the 
witness to explain what he means?” 
“The witness is invited to ampli- 
fy.” 

“Honorable Chairman, gentlemen 
members, there is indeed a way for 
Luna to expand by tenfold or even 
a hundred her shipments to your 
hungry millions. The fact that grain 
barges continued to arrive on sched- 
ule during our time of trouble and 
are still arriving today is proof that 
our intentions are friendly. But you 
do not get milk by beating the cow. 
Discussions of how to augment our 
shipments must be based on the facts 
of nature, not on the false assump- 
tion that we are slaves, bound by a 
work quota we never made. So whdch 
shall it be? Will you persist in be- 
lieving that we are slaves, indentured 
to an Authority other than ourselves? 
Or will you acknowledge that we are 
free, negotiate with us and learn 
how we can help you?” 

Chairman said, “In other words 



you ask us to buy a pig in a poke. 
You demand that we legalize your 
outlaw status . then you will talk 
about fantastic claims that you can 
increase grain shipments ten or a 
hundred fold. What you claim is 
impossible; I am expert in Lunar 
economics. And what you ask is 
impossible; it takes the Grand As- 
sembly to admit a new nation.” 

“Then place it before the Grand 
Assembly. Once seated as sovereign 
equals, we will discuss how to in- 
crease shipments and negotiate terms. 
Honorable Chairman, grow the 
grain, we own it. We can grow far 
more. But not as slaves. L ina’s sov- 
ereign freedom must first be recog- 
nized.” 

“Impossible and you know it. The 
Lunar Authority cannot abdicate its 
sacred responsibility.” 

Prof sighed. “It appears to be an 
impasse. I can only suggest that these 
hearings be recessed while we all 
take thought. Today our barges are 
arriving . but the moment that I 
am forced to notify my government 
that I have failed . tl-ey will . 
stopr 

Profs head sank back on pillow 
as if it had been too much for him 
— as may have been. I was doing 
well enough but was young and had 
had practice in how to visit Terra 
and stay alive. A Loonie his age 
should not risk it. After minor foo- 
fooraw which Prof ignored they load- 
ed us into a lorry and scooted us 
back to hotel. Once underway I said, 
“Prof, what was it you said to Senor

sure?” 

He chuckled. “Comrade Stuart’s

investigations of these gentlemen turn 
up remarkable facts. I asked who 
owned a certain brothel off Calle 
Florida in B.A. these days and did 
it now have a star redhead?” 

“Why? You used to patronize it?” 
Tried to imagine Prof in such! 

“Never. It has been forty years 
since I was last in Buenos Aires. He 
owns that establishment, Manuel, 
through a dummy, and his wife, a 
beauty with Titian hair, once work- 
ed in it.” 

Was sorry had asked. “Wasn’t that 
a foul blow? And undiplomatic?” 

But Prof closed eyes and did not 
answer. 

XXX 

H e was recovered enough to spend 
an hour at a reception for 
news men that night, with white hair 
framed against a purple pillow and 
thin body decked out in embroidered 
pajamas. Looked like vip corpse at 
an important funeral, except for eyes 
and dimples. I looked mighty vip 
too, in black and gold uniform which 
Stu claimed was Lunar diplomatic 
uniform of my rank. Could have 
been, if Luna had had such things. 
Did not, or I would have known. 
I prefer a p-suit; collar was tight. 
Nor did t ever find out what decora- 
tions on k meant. A reporter asked 
me about one, based on Luna at 
crescent as seen from Terra; told him 
it was a prize for spelling. Stu was 
in earshot and said, “The Colonel is 
modest. That decoration is of the 
same rank as the Victoria Cross and 
was awarded for heroism on — ” 

He led him away, still talking. Stu 



coi:Id lie standing up almost as well 
as Prof. Me, I have to think out a 
lie ahead of time. 

India newspapers and casts were 
rough that night; “threat” to stop 
grain shipments made them froth. 
Gentlest proposal was to clean out 
Luna, exterminate us “criminal trog- 
lodytes” and replace us with “honest 
Hindu peasants” who understood 
sacredness of life and would ship 
grain and more grain.’ 

Prof picked that night to talk and 
give handouts about Luna’s inability 
to continue shipments, and why — 
and Stu’s organization spread re- 
lease throughout Terra. Some report- 
ers took time to dig out sense of 
figures and tackled Prof on glaring 
discrepancy: 

“Professor de la Paz, here you 
say that grain shipments will dwin- 
dle away through failure of natural 
resources and that by 2082 Luna 
won’t even be able to feed its own 
people. Yet earlier today you told 
the Lunar Authority that you could 
increase shipments a dozen times or 
more.” 

Prof said sweetly, “That commit- 
tee with whom we have been holding 
discussions is the Lunar Authority?” 

“Well . it’s an open secret.” 

“So it is, sir, but they have main- 
tained the fiction of being an im- 
partial investigating committee of 
the Grand Assembly. Don’t you 
think they should disqualify them- 
selves? So that we could receive a 
fair hearing?” 

“Uh . it’s not my place to say, 
Professor. Let’s get back to my ques- 
tion. How do you reconcile the 
two?” 



THE AAOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



109 




‘I’m interested in why it’s not 
your place to say, sir. Isn’t it the 
concern of every citizen of Terra to 
help avoid a situation which will 
produce war between Terra and her 
neighbor?” 

War7 What in the world makes 
you speak of ‘war,’ Professor?” 
“Where else can it end, sir? If the 
Lunar Authority persists in its in- 
transigence? We cannot accede to 
their demands; those figures show 
why. If they will not see this, then 
they will attempt to subdue us by 
force . and we will fight back. 
Like cornered rats — for cornered 
we are, unable to retreat, unable to 
surrender. We do not choose war. 
We wish to live in peace with our 
neighbor planet — in peace and 
peaceful trade. But the choice is not 
ours. We are small, you are gigan- 
tic. I predict that the next move will 
be for the Lunar Authority to at- 
tempt to subdue Luna by force. This 
‘peace-keeping’ agency will start the 
first interplanetary war.” 

J ournalist frowned. “Aren’t you 
overstating it? Let’s assume that 
the Authority — or the Grand As- 
sembly, as the Authority hasn’t any 
warships of its own — let’s suppose 
the nations of Earth decide to dis- 
place your, uh, ‘government.’ You 
might fight, on Luna — I suppose 
you would. But that hardly consti- 
tutes interplanetary war. As you 
pointed out, Luna has no ships. To 
put it bluntly, you can’t reach us.” 

I had chair close by Prof’s stretch- 
er, listening. He turned to me. “Tell 
them. Colonel.” 

I parroted it. Prof and Mike had 
THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



worked out stock situations; I had 
memorized and was ready with an- 
swers. I said, “Do you gentlemen 
remember the Pathfinder? How she 
came plunging in, out of control?” 
They remembered. Nobody for- 
gets the greatest disaster of early 
days of space flight when unlucky 
Pathfinder hit a Belgian village. 

“We have no ships,” I went on, 
“but would be possible to throw 
those bargeloads of grain ... in- 
stead of delivering them into park- 
ing orbit.” 

Next day this evoked a headline: 
LOONIES THREATEN TO 
THROW RICE. At moment it pro- 
duced awkward silence. 

Finally journalist said, “Neverthe- 
less I would like'^to know how you 
reconcile your two statements — no 
more grain after 2082 . and ten 
or a hundred times as much.” 

“There is no conflict,” Prof an- 
swered. “They are based on differ- 
ent sets of circumstances. The fig- 
ures you have been looking at show 
the present circumstances . and 
the disaster they will produce in only 
a few years through drainage of 
Luna’s natural resources — disaster 
which these Authority bureaucrats 
— or should I say ‘authoritarian bu- 
reaucrats?’ — would avert by telling 
us to stand in the corner!” 

Prof paused for labored breathing, 
went on: “The circumstances under 
which we can continue, or greatly 
increase, our grain shipments are 
the obvious corollary of the first. As 
an old teacher I can hardly refrain 
from classroom habits; the corollary 
should be left as an exercise for the 
student. Will someone attempt it?” 

Ill 




W as uncomfortable silence, then 
a little man with strange ac- 
cent said slowly, “It sound to me as 
if you talk about way to replenish 
natural resource.” 

“Capital! Excellent!” Prof flashed 
dimples. “You, sir, will have a gold 
star on your term report! To make 
grain requires water and plant foods 
— phosphates, other things, ask the 
experts. Send these things to us; 
we’ll send them back as wholesome 
grain. Put down a hose in the limit- 
less Indian Ocean. Line up those 
millions of cattle here in India; col- 
lect their end product and ship it to 
us. Collect your own night soil. Don’t 
bother to sterilize it; we’ve learned 
to do such things cheaply and easily. 
Send us briny sea water, rotten fish, 
dead animals, city sewage, cow man- 
ure, offal of any sort — and we will 
send it back, tonne for tonne as 
golden grain! Send ten times as 
much, we’ll send back ten times as 
much grain. Send us your poor, 
your dispossessed, send them by 
thousands and hundreds of thou- 
sands; we’ll teach them swift, effi- 
cient Lunar methods of tunnel farm- 
ing and ship you back unbelievable 
tonnage. Gentlemen, Luna is one 
enormous fallow farm, four thou- 
sand million hectares, waiting!” 

That startled them. Then some- 
one said slowly, “But what do you 
get out of it? Luna, I mean.” 

Prof shrugged. “Money. In the 
form of trade goods. There are many 
things you make cheaply which are 
dear in Luna. Drugs. Tools. Book 
films. Gauds for our lovely ladies. 
Buy our grain and you can sell to 
us at a happy profit.” 



A Hindu journalist looked thought- 
ful, started to write. Next to him was 
a European type who seemed unim- 
pressed. He said, “Professor, have 
you any idea of the cost of shipping 
that much tonnage to the Moon?” 

Prof waved it aside. “A technical- 
ity. Sir, there was a time when it 
was not simply expensive to ship 
goods across oceans but impossible. 
Then it was expensive, difficult, 
dangerous. Today you sell goods 
half around your planet almost as 
cheaply as next dodr; long-distance 
shipping is the least important factor 
in cost. Gentlemen, I am not an 
engineer. But I have learned this 
about engineers. When something 
must be done, engineers can find a 
way that is economically feasible. If 
you want the grain we can grow, 
turn your engineers loose.” Prof 
gasped and labored, signaled for help 
and nurses wheeled him away. 

I declined to be questioned on it, 
telling them that they must talk to 
Prof when he was well enough to 
see them. So they pecked at me on 
other lines. One man demanded to 
know why, since we paid no taxes, 
we colonists thought we had a right 
to run things our own way? After 
all those colonies had been estab- 
lished by Federated Nations — by 
some of them. It had been terribly 
expensive. Earth had paid all bills 
— and now you colonists enjoy ben- 
efits and pay not one dime of taxes. 
Was that fair? 

I wanted to tell him to blow it. 
But Prof had again made me take 
a tranqmlizer and had required me 
to swot that endless list of answers 
to trick questions. “Let’s take that 



112 



IF 




one at a tune,’* I said. **First, what 
Is it you want us to pay taxes for? 
Tell me what I get and perhaps I’fl 
buy it. No, put it this way. Do you 
pay taxes?” 

“Certainly I do? And so should 
you.” 

“And what do you get for your 
taxes?” 

“Huh? Taxes pay for govern- 
ment.” 

I said, “Excuse me. I’m ignorant. 

I’ve lived my whole life in Luna, 
I don’t know much about your gov- 
ernment. Can you feed it to me in 
small pieces? What do you get for 
your money?” 

They all got interested and any- 
thing this aggressive little choom 
missed, other supplied. I kept list. 
When they stopped, I read it back: 
“Free hospitals — aren’t any in 
Luna. Medical insurance — we have 
that but apparently not what you 
mean by it. If a person wants insur- 
ance, he goes to a bookie and works 
out a bet. You can hedge anything, 
for a price. I don’t hedge my health. 
I’m healthy. Or was till I came here. 
We have a public library, one Car- 
negie Foundation started with a few 
book films. It gets along by charg- 
ing fees. Public roads. I suppose that 
would be our tubes. But they are no 
more free than air is free. Sorry, 
you have free air here, don’t you? 
I mean our tubes were built by 
companies who put up money and 
are downright nasty about expecting 
it back and then some. Public 
schools. There are schools in all 
warrens and I never heard of them 
turning away pupils, so I guess they 



are ‘public.’ But they pay well, too, 
because anyone in Luna who knows 
something useful and is willing to 
teach it, charges all the traffic will 
bear.” 

I went on: “Let’s see what else — 
Social security. I’m not sure what 
that is but, whatever it is, we don’t 
have it. Pensions. You can buy a 
pension. Most people don’t;, most 
families are large and old people, 
say a hundred and up,- either fiddle 
along at something they like, or sit 
and watch video. Or sleep. They 
sleep a lot, after say a hundred and 
twenty.” 

“Sir, excuse me. Do people really 
live as long on the Moon as they 
say?” 

I looked surprised but wasn’t; this 
was a “stimulated question” for 
which an answer had been taped. 
“Nobody knows how long a person 
will live in Luna; we haven’t been 
there long enough. Our oldest citi- 
zens were bom Earthside, it’s no 
test. So far, no one bom in Luna 
has died of old age, but that’s still 
no test; they haven’t had time to 
grow old yet, less than a century. 
But — Well, take me. Madam; how 
old would you say I am? I’m authen- 
tic Loonie, third generation.” 

“Uh, truthfully. Colonel Davis, I 
was surprised at your youthfulness 
— for this mission, I mean. You ap- 
pear to be about twenty-two. Are 
you oldCT? Not much, I fancy.” 
“Madam, I regret that your local 
gravitation makes it impossible for 
me to bow. Thank you. I’ve been 
married longer than that.” 

“What? Oh, you’re jesting!” 
“Madam, I would never venture 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



113 




to guess a lady’s age but, if you will 
emigrate to Luna, you will keep your 
present youthful loveliness much 
longer and add at least twenty years 
to your life.” I looked at list. “I’ll 
lump the rest of this together by 
saying we don’t have any of it in 
Luna, so I can’t see any reason to 
pay taxes for it. On that other point, 
sir, surely you know that the initial 
cost of the colonies has long since 
been repaid several times over 
through grain shipments alone? We 
are being bled white of our most 
essential resources . and not even 
being paid an open-market price. 
That’s why the Lunar Authority is 
being stubborn; they intend to go on 
bleeding us. The idea that Luna has 
been an expense to Terra and the 
investment must be recovered is a 
lie invented by the Authority to ex- 
cuse their treating us as slaves. The 
truth is that Luna has not cost Terra 
one dime this century — and the 
original investment has long since 
been paid back.” 

H e tried to rally. “Oh, surely 
you’re not claiming that the 
Lunar colonies have paid all the bil- 
lions of dollars it took to develop 
space flight?” 

“I could present a good case. 
However there is no excuse to charge 
that against us. You have space 
flight, you people of Terra. We do 
not. Lima has not one ship. So why 
should we pay for what we have 
never received? It’s like the rest of 
this list. We don’t get it, why should 
we pay for it?” 

Had been stalling, waiting for a 
claim that Prof had told me I was 



sure to hear . and got it at last. 

“Just a moment, please!” came a 
confident voice. “You ignored the 
two most important items on that 
list. Police protection and armed 
forces. You boasted that you were 
willing to pay for what you get . 
so how about paying almost a cen- 
tury of back taxes for those two? It 
should be quite a bill, quite a bill!” 
He smiled smugly. 

Wanted to thank him! — thought 
Prof was going to chide me for fail- 
ing to yank it out. People looked at 
each other and nodded, pleased I 
had been scored on. Did best to 
look innocent. “Please? Don’t under- 
stand. Luna has neither police nor 
armed forces.” 

“You know what I mean. You 
enjoy the protection of the Peace 
Forces of the Federated Nations. 
And you do have police. Paid for 
by the Lunar Authority! I know, to 
my certain knowledge, that two pha- 
langes were sent to the Moon less 
than a year ago to serve as police- 
men.” 

“Oh.” I sighed. “Can you tell me 
how F.N. peace forces protect Luna? 
I did not know that any of your na- 
tions wanted to attack us. We are 
far away and have nothing anyone 
envies. Or did you mean we should 
pay them to leave us alone? If so, 
there is an old saying that once you 
pay Danegeld, you never get rid of 
the Dane. Sir, we will fight F.N. 
armed forces if we must ... we shall 
never pay them. 

“Now about those so-called ‘po- 
licemen.* They were not sent to 
protect us. Our Declaration of In- 
dependence told the true story about 



114 



IF 




Aosc hoodlums — did your news- 
papers print it?” (Some had, some 
hadn’t — depended on country.) 
•They went mad and started raping 
and murdering! And now they are 
dead! So don’t send us any more 
troops!” 

Was suddenly “tired” and had to 
leave. Really was tired; not much 
of an actor and making that talk- 
talk come out way Prof thought it 
should was strain. 

XXXI 

W as not told till later that I had 
received an assist in that inter- 
view; lead about “police” and “arm- 
ed forces” had been fed by a stooge; 
Stu LaJoie took no chances. But by 
time I knew, I had had experience in 
handling interviews; we had them 
endlessly. 

Despite being tired was not 
through that night. In addition to 
press some Agra diplomatic corps 
had risked showing up — few and 
none officially, even from Chad. But 
we were curiosities and they wanted 
to look at us. 

Only one was important, a Chinee. 
Was startled to see him; he was 
Chinee member of committee. I met 
him simply as “Dr. Chan” and we 
pretended to be meeting first time. 

He was that Dr. Chan who was 
then Senator from Great China and 
also Great China’s long-time num- 
ber-one boy in Lunar Authority — 
and, much later, Vice Chairman and 
Premier, shortly before his assassina- 
tion. 

After getting out point I was sup- 
posed to make, with bonus through 



others that could have waited, I 
guided chair to bedroom and was at 
once summoned to Prof’s. “Manuel, 
I’m sure you noticed our distin- 
guished visitor from the Middle 
Kingdom.” 

“Old Chinee from committee?” 

“Try to curb the Loonie talk, son. 
Please don’t use it at all here, even 
with me. Yes. He wants to know 
what we meant by ‘tenfold or a 
hundredfold.’ So tell him.” 

“Straight? Or swindle?” 

“The straight. This man is no 
fool. Can you handle the technical 
details?” 

“Done my homework. Unless he’s 
expert in ballistics.” 

“He’s not. But don’t pretend to 
know anything you don’t know. And 
don’t assume that he’s friendly. But 
he could be enormously helpful if 
he concludes that our interests and 
his coincide. But don’t try to per- 
suade him. He’s in my study. Good 
luck. And remember — speak stan- 
dard English.” 

Dr. Chan stood up as I came in; 
I apologized for not standing. He 
said that he understood difficulties 
that a gentleman from Luna labored 
under here and for me not to exert 
myself — shook hands with himself 
and sat down. 

I’ll skip some formalities. Did we 
or did we not have some specific 
solution when we claimed there was 
a cheap way to ship massive tonnage 
to Luna? 

Told him was a method, expensive 
in investment but cheap in running 
expenses. “It’s the one we use on 
Luna, sir. A catapult, an escape- 
speed induction catapult.” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



115 




His expression changed not at all. 
“Colonel, arc you aware that such 
has been proposed many times and 
always rejected for what seemed 
good reasons? Something to do with 
air pressure.” 

“Yes, Doctor. But we believe, 
based on extensive analyses by com- 
puter and on our experience with 
catapulting, that today the problem 
can be solved. Two of our larger 
firms, the LuNoHo Company and 
the Bank of Hong Kong in Luna, 
are ready to head a syndicate to do 
it as a private venture. They would 
need help here on Earth and might 
share voting stock — though they 
would prefer to sell bonds and retain 
control. Primarily what they need is 
a concession from some govern- 
ment, a permanent easement on 
which to build the catapult. Probably 
India.” 

(Above was set speech. LuNo- 
HoCo was bankrupt if anybody ex- 
amined books, and Hong Kong Luna 
Bank was strained; was acting as 
central bank for country under- 
going upheaval. Purpose was to get 
in last word, “India.” Prof had 
coached me that this word must 
come last,) 

D r. Chan answered, “Never mind 
financial aspects. Anything 
which is physically possible can al- 
ways be made .financially possible; 
money is a bugaboo of small minds. 
Why do you select India?” 

“Well, sir, India now consumes, I 
believe, over ninety per cent of our 
grain shipments — ” 

“Ninety-three point one per cent.” 
“Yes, sir. India is deeply interest- 



ed in our grain, so it seemed likely 
that she would cooperate. She could 
grant us land, make labor and ma- 
terials available and so forth. But 
I mentioned India because she holds 
a wide choice of possible sites, very 
high mountains not too far from 
Terra’s equator. The latter is not 
essential, just helpful. But the site 
must be a high mountain. It’s that 
air pressure you spoke of, or air 
density. The catapult head should 
be at as high altitude as feasible but 
the ejection end, where the load 
travels over eleven kilometers per 
second, must be in air so thin that 
it approaches vacuum. Which calls 
for a very high mountain. Take the 
peak Nanda Devi, around four hun- 
dred kilometers from here. It has 
a railhead sixty kilometers from it 
and a road almost to its base. It is 
eight thousand meters high. I don’t 
know that Nanda Devi is ideal. It 
is simply a possible site with good 
logistics; the ideal site would have 
to be selected by Terran engineers.” 

“A higher mountain would be 
better?” 

“Oh, yes, sir!” I assured him. “A 
higher mountain would be preferred 
over one nearer the equator. The 
catapult can be designed to make 
up for loss in free ride from Earth’s 
rotation. The difficult thing is to 
avoid so far as possible this pesky 
thick atmosphere. Excuse me. Doc- 
tor; I did not mean to criticize your 
planet.” 

“There are higher mountains. Col- 
onel, tell me about this proposed 
catapult.” 

I started to. “The length of an 
escape-speed catapult is determined 



116 



IF 




by the acceleration. We think — or 
the computer calculates that an ac- 
celeration of twenty gravities is about 
optimum. For Earth’s escape speed 
this requires a catapult three hun- 
dred twenty-three kilometers in 
length. Therefore — ” 

“Stop, please! Colonel, are you 
seriously proposing to bore a hole 
over three hundred kilometers 
deep?*’ 

“Oh, no! Construction has to be 
above ground to permit shock waves 
to expand. The stator would stretch 
nearly horizontally, rising perhaps 
four kilometers in three hundred and 
in a straight line — almost straight, 
as Coriolis acceleration and other 
minor variables make it a gentle 
curve. The Lunar catapult is straight 
so far as the eye can see and so 
nearly horizontal that the barges 
just miss some peaks beyond it.” 

“Oh. I thought that you were 
over-estimating the capacity of pres- 
ent-day engineering. We drill deeply 
today. Not that deeply. Go on.” 

C4T^octor, it may be that com- 
mon misconception which 
caused you to check me is why such 
a catapult has not been constructed 
before this. I’ve seen those earlier 
studies. Most assumed that a cata- 
pult would be vertical, or that it 
would have to tilt up at the end to 
toss the spacecraft into the sky — 
and neither is feasible nor necessary. 
I suppose the assumption arose from 
the fact that your spaceships do 
boost straight up, or nearly.” 

I went on: “But they do that to 
get above atmosphere, not to get 
into orbit. Escape speed is not a 



vector quantity; it is scalar. A load 
bursting frorn a catapult at escape 
speed will not return to Earth no 
matter what its direction. Uh . 
two corrections: it must not be head- 
ed toward the Earth itself but at 
some part of the sky hemisphere, 
and it must have enough added vel- 
ocity to punch through whate'i^er at- 
mosphere it still traverses. If it is 
headed in the right direction it will 
wind up at Luna.” 

“Ah, yes. Then this catapult could 
be used but once each lunar month?” 

“No, sir. On the basis on which 
you were thinking it would be once 
every day, picking the time to fit 
where Luna will be in her orbit. But 
in fact — or so the computer says; 
Fm not an astronautics expert — 
in fact this catapult could be used 
almost any time, simply by varying 
ejection speed, and the orbits could 
still wind up at Luna.” 

“I don’t visualize that.” 

“Neither do I, Doctor, but — 
Excuse me but isn’t there an excep- 
tionally fine computer at Peiping 
University?” 

“And if there is?” (Did I detect 
an increase in bland inscrutability? 
A Cyborg-computer — Pickled 
brains? Or live ones, aware? Hor- 
rible, either way.) 

“Why not ask a topnotch com- 
puter for all possible ejection times 
for such a catapult as I have de- 
scribed? Some orbits go far outside 
Luna’s orbit before returning to 
where they can be captured by Luna, 
taking a fantastically long time. Oth- 
ers hook around Terra and then go 
quite directly. Some are as simple as 
the ones we use from Luna. There 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



117 




are periods each day when short 
orbits may be selected. But a load is 
in the catapult less than one minute; 
the limitation is how fast the loads 
can be made ready. It is even pos- 
sible to have more than one load 
going up the catapult at a time if 
the power is sufficient and com- 
puter control is versatile. The only 
thing that worries me is — these high 
mountains, they are covered with 
snow?” 

“Usually,” he answered. “Ice and 
snow and bare rock.” 

44TT7ell, sir, being born in Luna, 
▼ V I don’t know anything 
about snow. The stator would not 
only have to be rigid under the heavy 
gravity of this planet but would have 
to withstand dynamic thrusts at 
twenty gravities. I don’t suppose it 
could be anchored to ice or snow. 
Or could it be?” 

“I’m not an engineer, Colonel, but 
it seems unlikely. Snow and ice 
would have to be removed. And kept 
dear. Weather would be a problem, 
too.” 

“Weather I know nothing about. 
Doctor, and all I know about ice is 
that it has a heat of crystallization 
of three hundred thirty-five million 
joules per tonne. I have no idea how 
mai.y tonnes would have to be melt- 
ed to clear the site, or how much 
energy would be required to keep 
it clear, but it seems to me that it 
might take as large a reactor to keep 
it free of ice as to power the cata- 
pult.” 

“We can build reactors, we can 
melt ice. Or engineers can be sent 
north for re-education until they do 



understand ice.” Dr. Chan smiled 
and I shivered. “However the engi- 
neering of ice and snow was solved 
in Antarctica years go; don’t worry 
about it. A clear, solid-rock site 
about three hundred fifty kilometers 
long at a high altitude — Anything 
else I should know?” 

“Not much, sir. Melted ice could 
be collected near the catapult head 
and thus be the most massy part of 
what will be shipped to Luna — quite 
a saving. Also the steel canisters 
would be reused to ship ‘grain to 
Earth, thus stopping another drain 
that Luna can’t take. No reason why 
a canister should not make the trip 
hundreds of times. At Luna it would 
be much the way barges are now 
landed off Bombay, solid-charge 
retrorockets programmed by ground 
control — except that it would be 
much cheaper, two and a half kilo- 
meter seconds change of motion ver- 
sus eleven-plus, a squared factor of 
about twenty — but actually even 
more favorable, as retroes are para- 
sitic weight and the pay load im- 
proves accordingly. There is even a 
way to improve that.” 

“How?” 

“Doctor, this is outside my spe- 
cialty. But everybody knows that 
your best ships use hydrogen as re- 
action mass heated by a fusion re- 
actor. But hydrogen is expensive in 
Luna and any mass could be re- 
action mass; it just would not be as 
efficient. Can you visualize an enor- 
mous, brute-force space tug designed 
to fit Lunar conditions? It would use 
raw rock, vaporized, as reaction 
mass and would be designed to go 
up into parking orbit, pick up those

shipments from Terra, bring them 
down to Luna’s surface. It would be 
ugly, all the fancies stripped away — 
mi^t not be manned even by a Cy- 
borg. It can be piloted from the 
ground, by computer.” 

“Yes, I suppose such a ship could 
be designed. But let’s not complicate 
things. Have you covered the essen- 
tials about this catapult?” 

“I believe so. Doctor. The site is 
the crucial thing. Take that peak 
Nandi Devi. By the maps I have 
seen it appears to have a long, very 
high ridge sloping to the west for 
about the length of our catapult. If 
that is true, it would be ideal — less 
to cut away, less to bridge. I don’t 
mean that it is the ideal site but that 
is the sort to look for: a very hi^ 
peak with a long, long ridge west 
of it.” 

“I understand.” Dr. Chan left ab- 
ruptly.

N ext few weeks I repeated that in 
a dozen countries, always in 
private and with implication that it 
was secret. All that changed was 
name of mountain. 

In Ecuador I pointed out that 
Chimborazb was almost on equator 
— ideal! But in Argentina I empha- 
sized that their Aconcagua was hi^ 
est peak in Western Hemisphere. In 
Bolivia I noted that Altoplano was 
as high as Tibetan Plateau (almost 
true), much nearer equator, and of- 
fered a wide choice of sites for easy 
construction leading up to peaks 
comparable to any on Terra. 

I talked to a North American who 



was a political opponent of that 
choom who had called us “rabble.” 
I pointed out that, while Mount Mc- 
Kinley was comparable to anything 
in Asia or South America, there was 
much to be said for Mauna Loa — 
extreme ease of construction. Dou- 
bling gees to make it short enough to 
fit, and Hawaii would be Spaceport 
of World . whole world, for we 
talked about day when Mars would 
be exploited and freight for three 
(possibly four) planets would chan- 
nel through their “Big Island.” 

Never mentioned Mauna Loa’s 
volcanic nature; instead I noted that 
location permitted an aborted load 
to splash harmlessly in Pacific 
Ocean. 

In Sovunion was. only one peak 
discussed — Lenin, over seven thou- 
sand meters (and rather too close 
to their big neighbor). 

Kilimanjaro, Popocatepetl, Logan, 
El Libertado. My favorite peak 
changed by country; all that we re- 
quired was that it be “highest moun- 
tain” in hearts of locals. I found 
something good to say about modest 
mountains of Chad when we were 
entertained there and rationalized so 
well I almost believed it. 

Other times, with help of leading 
questions from Stu LaJoie’s stooges, 
I talked about chemical engineering 
(of which I know nothing but had 
memorized facts) on surface of 
Luna, where endless free vacuum 
and sun power and limitless raw 
materials and predictable conditions 
permitted ways of processing ex- 
pensive or impossible Earthside — 
when day arrived that cheap ship- 
ping boto ways made it profitable

to exploit Luna’s virgin resources. 
Was always a suggestion that en- 
trenched bureaucracy of Lunar Au- 
thority had failed to see great po- 
tential of Luna (true), plus an an- 
swer to a question asked, which 
answer asserted that Luna could ac- 
cept any number of colonists. 

This also was true, although never 
mentioned that Luna (yes, and some- 
times Luna’s Loonies) killed about 
half of new chums. But people we 
talked to rarely thought of emigrat- 
ing themselves. They thought of 
forcing or persuading others to emi- 
grate to relieve crowding — and to 
reduce their own taxes. Kept mouth 
shut about fact that half-fed swarms 
we saw everywhere did breed faster 
than even catapulting could possibly 
offset. 

We could not house, feed, and 
train even a million new chums each 
year — and a million wasn’t a drop 
on Terra; more babies than that 
were conceived every night. We 
could accept far more than would 
emigrate voluntarily but if they used 
forced emigration and flooded us . 
Luna has only one way to deal with 
a new chum: Either 4ie makes not 
one fatal mistake, in personal be- 
havior or in coping with environ- 
ment that will bite without warning 
... or he winds up as fertilizer in 
a tunnel farm. 

All that immigration in huge num- 
bers could mean would be that a 
larger percentage of immigrants 
would die. Too few of us to help 
them past natural hazards. 

However, Prof did most talking 
about “Luna’s great future.” I talked 
about catapults. 



D uring weeks we waited for com- 
mittee to recall us, we covered 
much ground. Stu’s men had things 
set up and only question was how 
much we could take. Would guess 
that every week on Terra chopped a 
year off our lives, maybe more for 
Prof. But he never complained and 
was always ready to be charming at 
one more reception. 

We spent extra time in North 
America. Date of our Declaration of 
Independence, exactly three hun- 
dred years after that of North Amer- 
ican British colonies, turned out to 
be wizard propaganda and Stu’s man- 
ipulators made most of it. North 
Americans are sentimental about 
their “United States” even though it 
ceased to mean anything once their 
continent had been rationalized by 
F.N. They elect a president every 
eight years, why, could not say — 
why do British still have Queen? — 
and boast of being “sovereign.” 
“Sovereign,” like “love,” means any- 
thing you want it to mean; it’s a 
word in dictionary between “sober” 
and “sozzled.” 

“Sovereignty” meant much in 
North America and “Fourth of July” 
was a magic date. Four th-of- July 
League handled appearances. Stu 
told us that it had not cost much to 
get it moving and nothing to keep 
going. League even raised money 
used elsewhere — North Americans 
enjoy giving no matter who gets it 
Farther south Stu used another 
date; his people planted idea that 
coup d’etat had been 5 May instead 
of two weeks later. We were greeted 
with “Cinco de Mayo! LibertadI 
Cinco de Mayo!” I thought they 



120 



IF 




were saying, “Thank you’* — Prof 
did all talking. 

But in 4th-of-July country I did 
better. Stu had me quit wearing a 
left arm in public, sleeves of my 
costumes were sewed up so that 
stump could not be missed, and 
word was passed that I had lost it 
“fighting for freedom.” Whenever I 
was asked about it, all I did was 
smile and say, “See what comes of 
biting nails?” 

I never liked North America, even 
first trip. It is not most crowded 
part of Terra, has a mere billion 
people. In Bombay they sprawl on 
pavements; in Great New York they 
pack them vertically — not sure any- 
one sleeps. Was glad to be in invalid’s 
chair. 

Is mixed-up place another way. 
They care about skin color — by 
making point of how they don*t 
care. First trip I was always too 
light or too dark, and somehow blam- 
ed either way, or was always being 
expected to take stand on things I 
have no opinions on. Bog knows I 
don’t know what genes I have. One 
grandmother came from a part of 
Asia where invaders passed through 
as regularly as locusts, raping as they 
went — why not ask her? 

Learned tq handle it by my sec- 
ond makee-learnee but it left a sour 
taste. Think I prefer a place as 
openly racist as India, where if you 
aren’t Hindu, you’re nobody — ex- 
cept that Parsees look down on 
Hindus and vice versa. However I 
never really had to cope with North 
America’s reverse-racism when be- 
ing “Colonel O’Kelly Davis, Hero of 
Lunar Freedom.” 



We had swarms of bleeding hearts 
around us, anxious to help. I let 
them do two things for me, things 
I had never had time, money or 
energy for as a student: I saw 
Yankees play and visited Salem. 

S hould have kept my illusions. 

Baseball is better over video, 
you can really see it and aren’t 
pushed in by two hundred thousand 
other people. Besides, somebody 
should have shot that outfield. I 
spent most of that game dreading 
moment when they would have to 
get my chair out through crowd — 
that and assuring host that I was 
having a wonderful time. 

Salem was just a place, no worse 
(and no better) than rest of Bos- 
ton. After seeing it I suspected they 
had hanged wrong witches. But day 
wasn’t wasted. I was filmed laying a 
wreath on a place where a bridge 
had been in another part of Boston, 
Concord, and made a memorized 
speech. Bridge is still there, actually. 
You can see it, down through glass. 
Not much of a bridge. 

Prof enjoyed it all, rough as it 
was on him; Prof had great capacity 
for enjoying. He always had some- 
thing new to tell about great future 
of Luna. In New York he gave 
managing director of a hotel chain, 
one with rabbit trade mark, a sketch 
of what could be done with resorts 
in Luna — once excursion rates were 
within reach of more people. Visits 
too short to hurt anyone, escort 
service included, exotic side trips, 
gambling — no taxes. 

Last point grabbed attention, so 
Prof expanded it into “longer old 



THE MOON IS A HARSH A4ISTRESS 



121 




age” theme — a chain of retirement 
hostels where an earthworm could 
live on Terr an old-age pension and 
go on living, twenty, thirty, forty 
years longer than on Terra. As an 
exile — but which was better? A live 
old age in Luna? Or a funeral crypt 
on Terra? His descendants could 
pay visits and fill those resort ho- 
tels. Prof embellished with pictures 
of “night clubs” with acts impossible 
in Terra’s horrible gravity, sports to 
fit our decent level of gravitation — 
even talked about swimming pools 
and ice skating and possibility of 
flying! (Thought he had tripped his 
safeties.) He finished by hinting that 
Swiss cartel had tied it up. 

Next day he was telling foreign- 
divisions manager of Chase Interna- 
tional Panagra that a Luna City 
branch should be staffed with para- 
plegics, paralytics, heart cases, am- 
putees, others who found high grav- 
ity a handicap. Manager was a fat 
man who wheezed. He may have 
been thinking of it personally — but 
his ears pricked up at “no taxes.” 

We didn’t have it all our own 
way. News was often against us and 
were always hecklers. Whenever I 
had to take them on without Prof’s 
help I was likely to get tripped. One 
man tackled me on Profs statement 
to Committee that we “owned” grain 
grown in Luna; he seemed to take 
it for granted that we did not. Told 
him I did not understand question. 

He ^answered, “Isn’t it true. Col- 
onel, that your provisional govern- 
ment has asked for membership in 
Federated Nations?” 

Should have answered, “No com- 
ment.” But fell for it and agreed. 



“Very well,” he said, “the impedi- 
ment seems to be the counterclaim 
that the Moon belongs to the Feder- 
ated Nations — as it always has — 
under supervision of the Lunar Au- 
thority. Either way, by your own 
admission, that grain belongs to the 
Federated Nations, in trust.” 

I asked how he reached that con- 
clusion? He answered, “Colonel, you 
style yourself ‘Undersecretary of 
Foreign Affairs.’ Surely you are fa- 
miliar with the charter of the Feder- 
ated Nations.” 

I had skimmed it. “Reasonably 
familiar,” I said — cautiously, I 
thought. 

“Then you know the First Free- 
dom guaranteed by the Charter and 
its current application through F & A 
Control Board Administrative Order 
Number eleven-seventy-six dated 
three March of this year. You con- 
cede therefore that all grain grown 
on the Moon in excess of the local 
ration is ab initio and beyond con- 
test the property of all, title held 
in trust by the Federated Nations 
through its agencies for distribution 
as needed.” He was writing as he 
talked. “Have you anything to add 
to that concession?” 

I said, “What in Bog’s name you 
talking about?” Then, “Come back! 
Haven’t conceded anything!” 

o Great New York Times printed: 
“LUNAR ‘UNDERSECRE- 
TARY, SAYS: ‘FOOD BELONGS

colonies said in a voluntary state- 
ment to this paper that the ‘Free- 
dom from Hunger’ clause in the 
Grand Charter applied to the Lunar 
grain shipments — ” 

I asked Prof how should have 
handled? “Always answer an un- 
friendly question with another ques- 
tion,” he told me. “Never ask him 
to clarify; he’ll put words in your 
mouth. This reporter — Was he skin- 
ny? Ribs showing?” 

“No. Heavy-set.” 

“Not living on eighteen hundred 
calories a day, I take it, which is 
the subject of that order he citeck 
Had you known you could have 
asked him how long he had con- 
formed to the ration and why he 
quit? Or asked him what he had for 
breakfast — and then looked un- 
believing no matter what he answer- 
ed. Or, when you don’t know what 
a man is getting at, let your counter- 
question shift the subject to some- 
thing you do want to talk about. 
Then, no matter what he answers, 
make your point and call on some- 
one else. Logic does not enter into 
it. Just tactics.” 

“Prof, nobody here is living on 
eighteen hundred calories a day. 
Bombay, maybe. Not here.” 

“Less than that in Bombay. Man- 
uel, that ‘equal ration* is a fiction. 
Half the food on this planet is in the 
black market, or is not reckoned 
through one ruling or another. Or 
they keep two sets of books, and 
figures submitted to the F.N. have 
nothing to do with the economy. Do 
you think that grain from Thailand 
and Burma and Australia is correct- 
ly reported to the Control Board by 



Great China? I’m sure that the India 
representative on that food board 
doesn’t think so. But India keeps 
quiet because she gets the lion’s share 
from Luna . and then ‘plays poli- 
tics with hunger’ — a phrase you 
may remember — by using our grain 
to control her elections. Kerala had 
a planned famine last year. Did you 
see it in the news?” 

“No.” 

“Because it wasn’t in the news. A 
managed democracy is a wonderful 
thing, Manuel, for the managers . 
and its greatest strength is a ‘free 
press’ when ‘free’ is defined as ‘re- 
sponsible’ and the managers define 
what is ‘irresponsible.’ Do you know 
what Luna needs most?” 

“More ice.” 

“A news system that does not 
bottleneck through one channel. O 
friend Mike is our greatest danger " 
“Huh? Don’t you trust Mike?” 
“Manuel, on some subjects I don't 
trust even myself. Limiting the free- 
dom of news ‘just a little bit’ is in 
the same category with the classic 
example ‘a little bit pregnant.’ We 
are not yet free nor will we be as 
long as anyone — even our ally Mike 
— controls our news. Someday I 
hope to own a newspaper indepen- 
dent of any source or channel. I 
would happily set print by hand, like 
Benjamin Franklin.” 

I gave up. “Prof, suppose these 
talks fail and grain shipments stop. 
What happens?” 

“People back home will be vexed 
with us . and many here on Terra 
would die. Have you read Malthus?” 
“Don’t think so.” 

“Many would die. Then a new 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

stability would be reached with 
somewhat more people — more effi- 
cient people and better fed. This 
planet isn’t crowded; it is just mis- 
managed . and the unkindest thing 
you can do for a hungry man is to 
give him food. ‘Give.’ Read Malthus. 
It is never safe to laugh at Dr. Mal- 
thus; he always has the last laugh. 
A depressing man, I’m glad he’s 
dead. But don’t read him until this 
is over; too many facts hamper a 
diplomat, especially an honest one.” 
“I’m not especially honest.” 

“But you have no talent for dis- 
honesty, so your refuge must be 
ignorance and stubbornness. You 
have the latter; try to preserve the 
former. For the nonce. Lad, Uncle 
Bernardo is terribly tired.” 

I said, “Sorry,” and wheeled out 
of his room. Prof was hitting too 
hard a pace. I would have be^ 
willing to quit if would insure his 
getting into a ship and out of that 
gravity. 

But traffic stayed one way — grain 
barges, naught else. 

B ut Prof had fun. As I left and 
waved lights out, noticed again 
a toy he had bought, one that de- 
lighted him like a kid on Christmas 
— a brass cannon. 

A real one from sailing ship days. 
Was small, barrel about half a meter 
long and massing, with Wooden car- 
riage, only kilos fifteen. A “signal 
gun” its papers said. Reeked of an- 
cient history, pirates, men “walking 
plank.” A pretty thing but I asked 
Prof why? If we ever managed to 
leave, price to lift that mass to Luna 



would hurt. I was resigned to aban- 
doning a p-suit with years more wear 
in it — abandon everything but two 
left arms and a pair of shorts. If 
pressed, might give up social arm. 
If very pressed, would skip shorts. 

He reached out and stroked shiny 
barrel. “Manuel, once there was a 
man who held a political make- 
work job like so many here in this 
Directorate, shining brass cannon 
around a court house.” 

“Why would court house have 
cannon?” 

“Never mind. He did this for 
years. It fed him and let him save 
a bit, but he was not getting ahead 
in the world. So one day he quit his 
job, drew out his savings, bought a 
brass cannon — and went into busi- 
ness for himself.” 

“Sounds like idiot.” 

“No doubt. And so were wc, when 
we tossed out the Warden. Manuel, 
you’ll outlive me. When Luna adopts 
a flag, I would like it to be a cannon, 
or, on field sable, crossed by bar sin- 
ister gules of our proudly ignoble 
lineage. Do you think it could be 
managed?” 

“Suppose so, if you’ll sketch. But 
why a flag? Not a flag pole in all 
Luna.” 

“It can fly in our hearts ... a 
symbol for all fools so ridiculously 
impractical as to think they can fight 
city hall. Will you remember, Man- 
uel?” 

“Sure. That is, will remind you 
when time comes.” Didn’t like such 
talk. He had started using oxygen 
tent in private — and would not use 
in public. 



124 



IF 




G uess I’m “ignorant” and “siub- 
born” — was both in place 
called Lexington, Kentucky, in Cen- 
tral Managerial Area. One thing no 
doctrine about, no memorized an- 
swers, was life in Luna. Prof said 
to tell truth and emphasize homely, 
warm, friendly things, especially 
anything different. “Remember, 
Manuel, the thousands of Terrans 
who have made short visits to Luna 
are only a tiny fraction of one per 
cent. To most people we will be as 
weirdly interesting as strange ani- 
mals in a zoo. Do you remember 
that turtle on exhibition in Old 
Dome? That’s us.” 

Certainly did; they wore that in- 
sect out, staring at. So when this 
male-female team started quizzing 
about family life in Luna, was happy 
to answer. I prettied it only by what 
I left out — things that aren’t family 
life but poor substitutes in a com- 
munity overloaded with males. 

Luna City is homes and families 
mainly, dull by Terran standards — 
but I like it. And other warrens 
much same, people who work and 
raise kids and gossip and find most 
of their fun around dinner table. Not 
much to tell, so I discussed anything 
they found interesting. Every Luna 
custom comes from Terra since that’s 
where we all came from, but Terra 
is such a big place that a custom 
from Micronesia, say, may be 
strange in North America. 

This woman — can’t call her lady 
— wanted to know about various 
sorts of marriage. First was it true 
that one could get married without 
a license “on” Luna? 

I asked what a license was? 



■ iwi companion said, “Skip it, 
Mildred. Pioneer societies never have 
marriage licenses.” 

“But don’t you keep records?” she 
persisted. 

“Certainly,” I agreed. “My family 
keeps a family book that goes back 
almost to first landing at Johnson 
City — every marriage, birth, death, 
every event of importance not only 
in direct line but all branches so far 
as we can keep track. And besides, 
is a man, a school teacher, going 
around copying old family records 
all over our warren, writing a history 
of Luna City. Hobby.” 

“But don’t you have official re- 
cords? Here in Kaintucky we have 
records that go back centuries.” 
“Madam, we haven’t lived there 
that long.” 

“Yes, but — Well, Luna City must 
have a city clerk. Perhaps you call 
him ‘county recorder’. The official 
who keeps track of such things. 
Deeds and so forth.” 

I said, “Don’t think so. Madam. 
Some bookies do notary work, wit- 
nessing chops on contracts, keeping 
records of them. Is for people who 
don’t read and write and can^t keep 
own records. But never heard of one 
asked to keep record of marriage. 
Not saying couldn’t happen. But 
haven’t heard.” 

“How delightfully informal! Then 
this other rumor, about how simple 
it is to get a divorce on the Moon. 
I daresay that’s true, too?” 

“No, madam, wouldn’t say di- 
vorce is simple. Too much to un- 
tangle. Mmm . take a nmple ex- 
ample, one lady and say she has 
two husbands — ” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



125 




“Two’?” 

iiTiyCight have more, might have 

-LVAjust one. Or might be com- 
plex marriage. But let’s take one 
lady and two men as typical. She 
decides to divorce one. Say it’s 
friendly, with other husband agree- 
ing and one she is getting rid of not 
making fuss. Not that it would do 
him any good. Okay, she divorces 
him; he leaves. Still leaves endless 
things. Men might be business part- 
ners, co-husbands often are. Divorce 
may break up partnership. Money 
matters to settle. This three may own 
cubic together, and while will be in 
her name, ex-husband probably has 
cash coming or rent. And almost al- 
ways there are children to consider, 
support and so forth. Many things. 
No, madam, divorce is never simple. 
Can divorce him in ten seconds but 
may take ten years to straighten out 
loose ends. Isn’t it much that way 
here?” 

“Uh . just fuhget ah evah ask- 
ed the question, Cunn’l; it may be 
simpluh hyuh.” (She did talk that 
way but was understandable once I 
got program. Won’t spell it again.) 
“But if that is a simple marriage, 
what is a ‘complex’ one?” 

Found self explaining polyandries, 
clans, groups, lines and less com- 
mon patterns considered vulgar by 
conservative people such as my own 
family. Deal my mother set up, say, 
after she ticked off my old man, 
though didn’t describe that one. 
Mother was always too extreme. 

Woman said, “You have me con- 
fused. What is the difference be- 
tween a line and a clan?” 



“Are quite different. Take own 
case. I have honor to be member of 
one of oldest line marriages in Luna 
— and, in my prejudiced opinion, 
best. You asked about divorce. Our 
family has never had one and would 
bet long odds never will. A line mar- 
riage increases in stability year after 
year, gains practice in art of getting 
along together, until notion of any- 
body leaving is unthinkable. Besides, 
takes unanimous decision of all wives 
to divorce a husband. Could never 
happen. Senior wife would' never let 
it get that far.” 

Went on describing advantages — 
financial security, fine home life it 
gives children, fact that death of a 
spouse, while tragic, could never be 
tragedy it was in a temporary fam- 
ily, especially for children. Children 
simply could not be orphaned. Sup- 
pose I waxed too enthusiastic — but 
my family is most important thing 
in my life. Without them Fm just 
one-armed mechanic who could be 
eliminated without causing a draft. 

“Here’s why is stable,” I said. 
‘Take my youngest wife, sixteen. 
Likely be in her eighties before she is 
senior wife. Doesn’t mean all wives 
senior to her will die by then; un- 
likely in Luna, females seem to be 
immortal. But may all opt out of 
family management by then; by our 
family traditions they usually do, 
without younger wives putting pres- 
sure on them. So Ludmilla — ” 

“ ‘LudmiUa’?” 

“Russki name. From fairy tale. 
Milla will have over fifty years of 
good example before has to carry 
burden. She’s sensible to start with, 
not likely to make mistakes and if 



126 



IF 




did, has other wives to steady her. 
Self-correcting, like a machine with 
proper negative feedback. A good 
fine marriage is immortal; expect 
Baine to outlast me at least a thou- 
sand years — and is why shan’t mind 
d3ring when time comes. Best part of 
me will go on living.” 

P rof was being wheeled out; he 
had them stop stretcher cart 
and listened. I turned to him. 

“Professor,” I said, “you know my 
family. Would mind telling this lady 
why it’s a happy family? If you 
think so.” 

“It is,” agreed Prof. “However, I 
would rather make a more general 
remark. Dear Madam, I gather that 
you find our Lunar marriage cus- 
toms somewhat exotic.” 

“Oh, I wouldn’t go that far!” she 
said hastily. “Just somewhat un- 
usual.** 

“They arise, as marriage customs 
always do, from economic necessi- 
ties of the circumstances — and our 
circumstances are very different 
from those here on Earth. Take the 
line type of marriage which my col- 
league has been praising . and 
justifiably I assure you, despite his 
personal bias. I am a bachelor and 
have no bias. Line marriage is the 
strongest possible device for con- 
serving capital and insuring the wel- 
fare of children — the two basic so- 
cjptal functions for marriage every- 
where — in an environment in which 
there is no security, neither for capi- 
tal nor for children, other than that 
devised by individuals. Somehow hu- 
man beings always cope with their 
environments. Line marriage is a 



remarkably successful invention to 
that end. All other Lunar forms of 
marriage serve that same purpose, 
though not as well.” 

He said good night and left. I had 
with me — always! — a picture of 
my family, newest one, our wedding 
with Wyoming. Brides are at their 
prettiest and Wyoh was radiant — 
and rest of us looked handsome and 
happy, with GrandpaW tall and 
proud and not showing failing facul- 
ties. 

But was disappointed; they looked 
at it oddly. But man — Mathews, 
name was — said, “Can you spare 
this picture. Colonel?” 

Winced. “Only copy I have. And 
a long way from home.” 

“For a moment, I mean. Let me 
have it photographed. Right here, it 
need never leave your hands.” 

“Oh. Oh, certainly!” Not a good 
picture of me but is face I have,' 
and did Wyoh justice and they just 
don’t come prettier than Lenore. 

So he photographed it and next 
morning they did come right into our 
hotel suite and woke me before time 
and did arrest me and take me away 
wheelchair and all and did lock me 
in a cell with bars! For bigamy. For 
polygamy. For open immorality and 
publicly inciting others to same. 
Was glad Mum couldn’t see. 

XXXIII 

T ook Stu all day to get case 
transferred to an F.N. court and 
dismissed. His lawyers asked to have 
it tossed out on “diplomatic immun- 
ity” but F.N. judges did not fall into 
trap. Merely noted that alleged of- 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



127 




fenses had taken place outside juris- 
diction of lower court, except alleged 
“inciting” concerning which they 
found insufficient evidence. Aren’t 
any F.N. laws covering marriage. 
Can’t be — just a rule about each 
nation required to give “full faith 
and credence” to marriage customs 
of other member nations. 

Out of those eleven billion people 
perhaps seven billion lived where 
polygamy is legal, and Stu’s opinion 
manipulators played up “persecu- 
tion”. It gained us sympathy from 
people who otherwise would never 
have heard of us — even gained it 
in North America and other places 
where polygamy is not legal, from 
people who believe in “live and let 
live.” All good, because always prob- 
lem was to be noticed. To most of 
those bee-swarm billions Luna was 
nothing; our rebellion hadn’t been 
noticed. 

Stu’s operators had gone to much 
thought to plan setup to get me ar- 
rested. Was not told until weeks 
later after time to cool off and sec 
benefits. Took a stupid judge, a dis- 
honest sheriff and barbaric local pre- 
judice which I triggered with that 
sweet picture, for Stu admitted later 
that range of color in Davis family 
was what got judge angry enough 
to be foolish even beyond native 
talent for nonsense. 

My one Consolation, that Mum 
could not see my disgrace, turned 
out mistaken. Pictures, taken through 
bars and showing grim face, were in 
every Luna paper, and write-ups 
used narstiest Earthside stories, not 
larger number that deplored injus- 
tice. But should have had more faith 



in Mimi. She wasn’t ashamed, sim- 
ply wanted to go Earthside and rip 
some people to pieces. 

While helped Earthside, greatest 
good was in Luna. Loonies became 
more unified over this silly huhu 
than had ever been before. They 
took it personally and “Adam Se- 
lene” and “Simon Jester” pushed 
it. Loonies are easy going except on 
one subject, women. Every lady felt 
insulted by Terran news stories — so 
male Loonies who had ignored poli- 
tics suddenly discovered t was their 
boy. 

Spinoff. Old lags feel superior to 
those not transported. Later found 
self greeted by ex-cons with: “Hi, 
jail bird!” A lodge greeting — I was 
accepted. 

But saw nothing good about it 
then! Pushed around, treated like 
cattle, fingerprinted, photographed, 
given food we wouldn’t offer hogs, 
exposed to endless indignity, and 
only that heavy field kept me from 
trying to kill somebody. Had I been 
wearing number-six arm when grab- 
bed, might have tried. 

But steadied down once I was 
freed. Hour later we were on way 
to Agra; had at last been summon- 
ed by Committee. Felt good to be 
back in suite in maharajah’s palace 
but eleven-hour zone change in less 
than three did not permit rest; we 
went to hearing bleary-eyed and held 
together by drugs. 

“Hearing” was one-sided; we lis- 
tened while chairman talked. Talked 
an hour; I’ll summarize: 

O ur preposterous claims were re- 
jected. Lunar Authority’s sa- 



128 



IF 




cred trust could not be abandoned. 
Disorders on Earth’s Moon could 
not be tolerated. Moreover recent 
disorders showed that Authority had 
been too lenient. Omission was now 
to be corrected by an activist pro- 
gram, a five-year plan in which all 
phases of life in Authority’s trustee- 
ship would be overhauled. A code of 
laws was being drafted; civil and 
criminal courts would be instituted 
for benefit of “client-employees” — 
which meant all persons in trust area, 
not just consignees with uncomplet- 
ed sentences. Public schools would 
be established, plus indoctrinal adult 
schools for client-employees in need 
oi same. An economic, engineering 
and agricultural planning board 
would be created to provide fullest 
and most efficient use of Moon’s 
resources and labor of client-em- 
ployees. An interim goal of quad- 
rupling grain shipments in five years 
had been adopted as a figure easily 
attainable once scientific planning 
of resources and labor was in effect. 
First phase would be to withdraw 
client-employees from occupations 
found not to be productive and put 
them to drilling a vast new system 
of farm tunnels in order that hydro- 
ponics would commence in them not 
later than March 2078. These new 
giant farms would be operated by 
Lunar Authority, scientifically, and 
not left to whims of private owners. 
It was contemplated that this system 
would, by end of five-year plan, pro- 
duce entire new grain quota. In 
meantime client-employees produc- 
ing grain privately would be allowed 
to continue. But they would be ab- 
sorbed into new system as their less 



efficient methods were no longer 
needed. 

Chairman looked up from papers. 
“In short, the Lunar colonies are 
going to be civilized and brought 
into managerial co-ordination with 
the rest of civilization. Distasteful 
as this task has been, I feel — speak- 
ing as a citizen rather than as chair- 
man of this committee — I feel that 
we owe you thanks for bringing to 
our attention a situation so badly in 
need of correction.” 

Was ready to burn his ears off. 
“Client-employees”! What a fancy 
way to say “slaves”! But Prof said 
tranquilly, “I find the proposed plans 
most interesting. Is one permitted to 
ask questions? Purely for informa- 
tion?” 

“For information, yes.” 

North American member leaned 
forward. “But don’t assume that we 
are going to take any back talk from 
you cavemen! So mind your man- 
ners. You aren’t in the clear on this, 
you know.” 

“Order,” chairman said. “Proceed, 
Professor.” 

“This term ‘client-employee’ I find 
intriguing. Can it be stipulated that 
the majority of inhabitants of Earth’s 
major satellite are not undischarged 
consignees but free individuals?” 

“Certainly,” chairman agreed 
blandly. “All legal aspects of the new 
policy have been studied. With minor 
exceptions some ninety-one per cent 
of the colonists have citizenship, 
original or derived, in various mem- 
ber nations of the Federated Nations. 
Those who wish to return to their 
home countries have a right to do 
so. You will be pleased to learn that

the Authority is considering a plan 
under which loans for transportation 
can be arranged . probably under 
supervision of International Red 
Cross and Crescent. I might add that 
I myself am heartily backing this 
plan — as it renders nonsensical any 
talk about ‘slave labor.’” He smiled 
smugly. 

“I see,” agreed Prof. “Most hu- 
mane. Has the committee — or the 
Authority — pondered the fact that 
most — effectively all, I should say 
— considered the fact that inhabi- 
tants of Luna are physically unable 
to live on this planet? That they 
have undergone involuntary perma- 
nent exile through irreversible phy- 
siological changes and can never 
again live in comfort and health in 
a gravitational field six times great- 
er than that to which their bodies 
have become adjusted?” 

S coundrel pursed lips as if consid- 
ering totally new idea. 
“Speaking again for myself, I 
would not be prepared to stipulate 
that what you say is necessarily true. 
It might be true of some, might not 
be others. People vary widely. Your 
presence here proves that it is not 
impossible for a Lunar inhabitant to 
return to Earth. In any case we have 
no intention of forcing anyone to re- 
turn. We hope that they will choose 
to stay and we hope to encourage 
others to emigrate to the Moon. But 
these are individual choices, under 
the- freedoms guaranteed by the 
Great Charter. But as to this alleged 
physiological phenomenon — It is 
not a legal matter. If anyone deems 
it prudent, or thinks he would be 



happier, to stay on the Moon, that’s 
his privilege.” 

“I see, sir. We are free. Free to 
remain in Luna and work, at tasks 
and for wages set by you ... or free 
to return to Earth to die.” 

Chairman shrugged. “You as- 
sume that we are villains. We’re not. 
Why, if I were a young man I would 
emigrate to the Moon myself. Great 
opportunities! In any case I am not 
troubled by your distortions — his- 
tory will justify us.” 

Was surprised at Prpf; he was not 
fighting. Worried about him — 
weeks of strain and a bad night on 
top. All he said was, “Honorable 
Chairman, I assume that shipping 
to Luna will soon be resumed. Can 
passage be arranged for my col- 
league and myself in the first ship? 
For I must admit, sir, that this grav- 
itational weakness of which I spoke 
is, in our cases, very real. Our mis- 
sion is completed; we need to go 
home.” 

(Not a word about grain barges. 
Nor about “throwing rocks,” nor 
even futility of beating a cow. Prof 
just sounded tired.) 

Chairman leaned forward and 
spoke with grim satisfaction. “Pro- 
fessor, that presents difficulties. To 
put it bluntly, you appear to be 
guilty of treason against the Great 
Charter, indeed against all human- 
ity .. and an indictment is being 
considered. I doubt if anything more 
than a suspended sentence would be 
invoked against a man of your age 
and physical condition. However . 
do you think it would be prudent of 
us to give you passage back to the 
place where you committed these 



130 



IF 




acts — there to stir up more mis- 
chief?” 

Prof sighed. “I understand your 
point. Then, sir, may I be excused? 
I am weary.” 

“Certainly. Hold yourself at the 
disposal of this committee. The hear- 
ing stands adjourned. Colonel Da- 
vis.” 

“Sir?” I was directing wheelchair 
around, to get Prof out at once; our 
attendants had been sent outside. 

“A word with you, please.” 

“Uh — ” Looked at Prof; eyes 
were closed and seemed unconscious. 
But he moved one finger, motioning 
me to him. “Honorable Chairman, 
I’m more nurse than diplomat; have 
to look after him. He’s an old man, 
he’s ill.” 

“The attendants will take care of 
him.” 

“Well — ” Got as close to Prof as 
I could from chair, leaned over him. 
“Prof, are you right?” 

He barely whispered. “See what 
he wants. Agree with him. But stall.” 

M oments later was alone with 
chairman, soundproof door 
locked. Meant nothing. Room could 
have a dozen ears, plus one in my 
left arm. 

He said, “A drink? Coffee?” 

I answered, “No, thank you, sir. 
Have to watch my diet here.” 

“I suppose so. Are you really 
limited to that chair? You look 
healthy.” 

I said, “I could, if had to, get up 
and walk across room. Might faint. 
Or worse. Prefer not to risk. Weigh 
six times what I should. Heart’s not 
used to it.” 



“I suppose so. Colonel, I hear you 
had some silly trouble in North 
America. I’m sorry, I truly am. Bar- 
baric place. Always hate to have to 
go there. I suppose you’re wondering 
why I wanted to see you.” 

“No, sir, assume you’ll tell when 
suits you. Instead was wondering 
why you still call me ‘Colonel.’ ” 

He gave a barking laugh. “Habit, 
I suppose. A lifetime of protocol. 
Yet it might be well for you to con- 
tinue with that title. Tell me, what 
do you think of our five-year plan?” 
Thought it stunk. “Seems to have 
been carefully thought out.” 

“Much thought went into it. Col- 
onel, you seem to be a sensible man. 
I know you are. I know not only 
your background but practically 
every word you’ve spoken, almost 
your thoughts, ever since you set 
foot on Earth. You were born on the 
Moon. Do you regard yourself as a 
patriot? Of the Moon?” 

“Suppose so. Though tend to think 
of what we did just as something 
that had to be done.” 

“Between ourselves — yes. That 
old fool Hobart. Colonel, that is a 
good plan . but lacks an execu- 
tive. If you are really a patriot or 
let’s say a practical man with your 
country’s best interests at heart, you 
might be the man to carry it out.” 
He held up hand. “Don’t be hasty! 
I’m not asking you to ‘sell out,’ ‘turn 
traitor,’ or any nonsense like that. 
This is your chance to be a real 
patriot — not some phony hero who 
gets himself killed in a lost cause. 
Put it this way. Do you think it is 
possible for the Lunar colonies to 
hold out against all the force that 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



131 




(he Federated Nations of Earth can 
bring to bear? You’re not really a 
military man, and I know that, too. 
In your honest estimation how many 
ships and bombs do you think it 
would take to destroy the Lunar 
colonies?” 

I answered, “One ship, six 
bombs.” 

“Correct! My God, it’s good to 
talk to a sensible man. Two of them 
would have to be awf’ly big, perhaps 
specially built. A few people would 
stay alive, for a while, in smaller 
warrens beyond the blast areas. But 
one ship would do it, in ten min- 
utes.” 

I said, “Conceded, sir, but Profes- 
sor de la Paz pointed out that you 
don’t get milk by beating a cow. And 
certainly can’t by shooting it.” 

“Why do you think we’ve held 
back, done nothing, for over a 
month? That idiot colleague of mine 
— I won’t name him — spoke of 
‘back talk.’ Back talk doesn’t fret 
me. It’s just talk. And I’m interested 
in results. No, my dear Colonel, we 
won’t shoot die cow . but we 
would, if forced to, let the cow know 
it could be shot. H-missiles are ex- 
pensive toys but we could afford to 
expend some as warning shots, wast- 
ed on bare rock to let the cow know 
what could happen. But that is more 
force than one likes to use. It might 
frighten the cow and sour its milk.” 
He gave another barking laugh. 
“Better to persuade old bossy to give 
down willingly.” 

I waited. “Don’t you want to know 
how?” he asked. 

“How?” I agreed. 



“Through you. Don’t say a word 
and let me explain.” 

He took me up on that high moun- 
tain and offered me kingdoms of 
Earth. Or of Luna. Take job of 
“Protector Pro Tern” with under- 
standing was mine permanently if I 
could deliver. Convince Loonies they 
could not win. Convince them that 
diis new setup was to their advan- 
tage — emphasize benefits, free 
schools, free hospitals, free this and 
that — details later but an every- 
where government just like on Ter- 
ra. Taxes starting low and handled 
painlessly by automatic checkoff and 
through kickback revenues from 
grain shipments. But most, impor- 
tant, this time Authority would not 
send a boy to do a man’s job. Two 
regiments of police at once. 

“Those damned Peace Dragoons 
were a mistake,” he said, “one we 
won’t make again. Between our- 
selves, the reason it has taken us a 
month to work this out is that we 
had to convince the Peace Control 
Commission that a handful of men 
cannot police three million people 
spread through six largish warrens 
and fifty and more small ones. So 
you’ll start with enough police. Not 
combat troops but military police 
used to quelling civilians with a min- 
imum of fuss. Besides that, this time 
they’ll have female auxiliaries. The 
standard ten per cent. No more rape 
complaints. Well, sir? Think you can 
swing it? Knowing it’s best in the 
long run for your own people?” 

I said I ought to study it in de- 
tail, particularly plans and quotas 
for five-year plan, rather than make 
snap decision. 



132 



IF 




“Certainly, certainly!” he agreed. 
“I’ll give you a copy of the white 
paper we’ve made up. Take it home, 
study it, sleep on it. Tomorrow we’ll 
talk again. Just give me your word 
as a gentleman to keep it under your 
hair. No secret, really . but these 
things are best settled before they 
are publicized. Speaking of public- 
ity, you’ll need help — and you’ll 
get it. We’ll go to the expense of 
sending up topnotch men, pay them 
what it’s worth, have them centri- 
fuge the way those scientists do — 
you know. This time we’re doing it 
right. That fool Hobart — he’s 
actually dead, isn’t he?” 

“No, sir. Senile, however.” 
“Should have killed him. Here’s 
your copy of the plan.” 

“Sir? Speaking of old men — 
Professor de la Paz can’t stay here. 
Wouldn’t live six months.” 

“That’s best, isn’t it?” 

I tried to answer levelly, “Yoo 
don’t understand. He is greatly loved 
and respected. Best thing would be 
for me to convince him that you 
mean business with those H-missiles 
— and that it is his patriotic duty 
to salvage what we can. But, eithor 
way, if I return without him . 
well, not only could not swing k; 
wouldn’t live long enough to try.” 
“Hmm. Sleep on it. We’ll talk to- 
morrow. Say fourteen o’clock.” 

I left and as soon as was loaded 
into lorry gave way to shakes. 
Just don’t have high-level approach. 

Stu was waiting with Prof. “Well?” 
said Prof. 

I glanced around, tapped ear. We 
huddled, heads over Prof’s head and 



two blankets over us all. Stretcher 
wagon was clean and so was my 
chair; I checked them each morning.. 
But for room itself seemed safer to 
whisper under blankets. 

Started in. Prof stopped me. “Dis- 
cuss his ancestry and habits later. 
The facts.” 

“He offered me job of warden.” 
“I trust you accepted.” 

“Ninety per cent. I’m to study 
this garbage and give answer to- 
morrow. Stu, how fast can we exe- 
cute Plan Scoot?” 

“Started. We were waiting for you 
to return. If they let you return.” 

Next fifty minutes were busy. Stu 
produced a gaunt Hindu in a doti; in 
thirty minutes he was a twin of Prof, 
and Stu lifted Prof off wagon onto 
a divan. Duplicating me was easier. 
Our doubles were wheeled into 
suite’s living room just at dusk and 
dinner was brought in. Several peo- 
ple came and went — among them 
elderly Hindu woman in sari, on arm 
of Stuart LaJoie. A plump babu fol- 
lowed them. 

Getting Prof up steps to roof was 
worst. He had never worn powered 
walkm, had no chance to practice 
and had been flat on back for more 
dian a mondi. 

But Stu’s arm kept him steady. I 
gritted teeth and climbed those Air- 
teen terrible steps by myself. By time 
I reached roof heart was ready to 
burst. Was put to it not to black out. 
A silent little flitter craft came out of 
gloom right on schedule and ten 
minutes later we were in chartered 
ship we had used past month — two 
minutes after Aat we jetted for Au- 
stralia. Don’t know what it cost to

prepare this dance and keep it ready 
against need, but was no hitch. 

Stretched out by Prof and caught 
breath, then said, “How you feel. 
Prof?” 

“Okay. A bit tired. Frustrated.” 
“Ja da. Frustrated.” 

“Over not seeing the Taj Mahal, 
I mean. I never had opportunity as 
a young man — and here I’ve been 
within a kilometer of it twice, once 
for several days, now for another 
day . and still I haven’t seen it 
and never shall.” 

“Just a tomb.” 

“And Helen of Troy was just a 
woman. Sleep, lad.” 

W e landed in Chinee half of Au- 
stralia, place called “Darwin,” 
and were carried straight into a ship, 
placed in acceleration couches and 
dosed. Prof was already out and I 
was beginning to feel dopy when Stu 
came in, grinned, and strapped down 
by us. I looked at him. “You, too? 
Who’s minding shop?” 

“The same people who’ve been 
doing the real work all along. It’s a 
good setup and doesn’t need me any 
longer. Mannie old cobber, I did 
not want to be marooned a long way 
from home. Luna, I mean, in case 
you have doubts. This looks like the 
last train from Shanghai.” 

“What’s Shanghai got to do with?” 
“Forget I mentioned it. Mannie, 
Fm flat broke, concave. I owe money 
m all directions — debts that will be 
paid only if certain stocks move the 
way Adam Selene convinced me they 
would move, shortly after this point 
m history. And if Fm wanted, or 
will be, for offenses against the pub- 



lic peace and dignity. Put it this 
way: Fm saving them the trouble of 
transporting me. Do you think I can 
learn to be a drillman at my age?” 
Was feeling foggy, drug taking 
hold. “Stu, in Luna y’aren’t old . 
barely started . ’nyway ... eat 
our table f’rever! Mimi likes you.” 
“Thanks, cobber, I might. Warn- 
ing light! Deep breath!” 

Suddenly was kicked by ten gee. 

xxxiy 

O ur craft was ground-to-orbit 
ferry type used for manned 
satellites, for supplying F.N. ships 
in patrol orbit, and for passengers 
to and from pleasure-and-gambling 
satellites. She was carrying three pas- 
sengers instead of forty, no cargo 
except three p-suits and a brass can- 
non (yes, silly toy was along; p-suits 
and Prof’s bang-bang were in Au- 
stralia a week before we were) and 
good ship Lark had been stripped 
— total crew was skipper and a Cy- 
borg pilot. 

She was heavily over-fueled. 

We made (was told) normal ap- 
proach on Elysium satellite . then 
suddenly scooted from orbital speed 
to escape speed, a change even more 
violent than liftoff. 

This was scanned by F.N. Sky- 
track; we were commanded to stop 
and explain. I got this second hand 
from Stu, self still recovering and 
enjoying luxury of no-gee with one 
strap to anchor. Prof still out. 

“So they want to know who we 
are and what we think we are do- 
ing,” Stu told me. “We told them 
that we were Chinese registry sky

wagon Opening Lotus bound on an 
errand of mercy, to wit, rescuing 
ttK>se scientists marooned on the 
Moon, and gave our identification — 
as Opening Lotus** 

“How about transponder?” 
“Mannie, if I got what I paid for, 
our transponder identified us as the 
Lark up to ten minutes ago . and 
now has I.D.’d us as the Lotus. Soon 
we will know. Just one ship is in 
position to get a missile off and it 
must blast us in — ” he stopped to 
look — “another twenty-seven min- 
utes according to the wired-up gen- 
tleman booting this bucket, or its 
diances of getting us are poor to 
zero. So if it worries you — if you 
have prayers to say or messages to 
send or whatever it is one does at 
such times — now is the time.” 
“Think we ought to rouse Prof?” 
“Let him sleep. Can you think of 
a better way to make the jump than 
from peaceful sleep instantaneously 
into a cloud of radiant gas? Unless 
you know that he has religious ne- 
cessities to attend to? He nevw 
struck me as a religious man, ortho- 
doctrinally speaking.” 

“He*s not. But if you have such 
duties, don’t let me keep you.” 
“Thank you, I took care of what 
seemed necessary before we left 
ground. How about yourself, Man- 
nie? I’m not much of a padre but 
ni do my best, if I can help. Any 
sins on your mind, old cobber? If 
you need to confess, I know quite a 
little about sin.” 

Told him my needs did not run 
that way. Then did recall sins, some 
I cherished, and gave him a version 
nMSxt or less true. That reminded 



him of some of his own, which re- 
minded me — 

Zero time came and went before 
we ran out of sins. Stu LaJoie is a 
good person to spend last minutes 
with, even if don’t turn out to be 
last. 

W e had two days with naught to 
do but undergo drastic rou- 
tines to keep us from carrying ump- 
teen plagues to Luna. But didn’t 
mind sihaking from induced chills 
and burning with fever. Free fall 
was such a relief and was so happy 
to be going home. 

Or almost happy. Prof asked what 
was troubling me. “Nothing,” I said. 
“Can’t wait to be home. But truth 
is, ashamed to show face after we’ve 
failed. Prof, what did we do wrong?” 
“Failed, my boy?” 

“Don’t see what else can call it. 
Asked to be recognized. Not what 
we got.” 

“Manuel, I owe you an apology. 
You will recall Adam Selene’s pro- 
jection of our chances just before we 
left home.” Stu was not in earshot 
but “Mike” was word we never us- 
ed; was always “Adam Selene” for 
security. 

“Certainly do! One in fifty-three. 
Then when we reached Earthside 
dropped to reeking one in hundred. 
What you guess it is now? One in 
thousand?” 

“I’ve had new projections every 
few days . which is why I owe 
you an apology. The last, received 
just before we left, included the 
then-untested assumption that we 
would escape, get clear of Tote and 
home safely. Or that at least one

Comrade Stu was summoned home, 
he having a Terran’s tolerance of 
high acceleration. Eight projections, 
in fact, ranging from three of us 
dead, through various combinations 
up to three surviving. Would you 
care to stake a few dollars on what 
that last projection is, setting a 
bracket and naming your own odds? 
ni give a hint. You are far too pes- 
simistic.” 

“Uh ... no, damn it! Just tell.” 
“The odds against us are now only 
seventeen to one . and they’ve 
been shortening all month. Which I 
couldn’t tell you.” 

Was amazed, delighted, overjoyed 
— hurt. “What you mean, couldn’t 
tell me? Look, Prof, if not trusted, 
deal me out and put Stu in executive 
cell.” 

“Please, son. That’s where he will 
go if anything happens to any of 
us — you, me, or dear Wyoming. I 
could not tell you Earthside — and 
can tell you now — not because you 
aren’t trusted but because you arc 
no actor. You could carry out your 
role more effectively if you believed 
that our purpose was to achieve rec- 
ognition of independence.” 

“Now he tells!” 

“Manuel, Manuel, we had to fight 
hard every instant — and lose.” 

“So? Am not big enough boy to 
he told?” 

“Please, Manuel. Keeping you 
temporarily in the dark greatly en- 
hanced our chances; you can check 
this with Adam. May I add that 
Stuart accepted his summons to Luna 
blithely without asking why? Com- 
rade, that committee was too small. 



its chairman too intelligent. There 
was always the hazard that they 
might offer an acceptable compro- 
mise. That first day there was grave 
danger .of it. Had we been able to 
force our case before the Grand As- 
sembly there would have been no 
danger of intelligent action. But we 
were balked. The best I could do 
was to antagonize the committee, 
even stooping to personal insult to 
make certain of at least one hold-out 
against common sense.” 

“Guess I never -will understand 
high-level approach.” 

“Possibly not. But your talents and 
mine complement each other. Man- 
uel, you wish to see Luna free.” 
“You know I do.” 

“You also know that Terra can 
defeat us.” 

4COure. No projection ever gave 
O anything close to even mon- 
ey. So don’t see why you set out to 
antagonize — ” 

“Please. Since they can inflict their 
will on us, our only chance lies in 
weakening their will. That was why 
we had to go to Terra. To be divi- 
sive. To create many opinions. The 
shrewdest of the great generals in 
China’s history once said that per- 
fection in war lay in so sapping the 
opponent’s will that he surrenders 
without fighting. In that maxim lies 
both our ultimate purpose and our 
most pressing danger. Suppose, as 
seemed possible that first day, we 
had been offered an inviting com- 
promise. A governor in place of a 
warden, possibly from our own num- 
ber. Local autonomy. A delegate in 
the Grand Assembly. A higher price

for grain at the catapult head, plus 
a bonus for increased shipments. A 
disavowal of Hobart’s policies com- 
bined with an expression of regret 
over the rape and the killings with 
handsome cash settlements to the 
victims’ survivors. Would it have 
been accepted? Back home?” 

“They did not offer that.” 

“The chairman was ready to offer 
something like it that first afternoon 
and at that time he had his com- 
mittee in hand. He offered us an 
asking price close enough to permit 
such a dicker. Assume that we reach- 
ed in substance what I outlined. 
Would it have been acceptable?” 

“Uh . maybe.” 

“More than a ‘maybe’ by the bleak 
projection made just before we left 
home. It was the thing to be avoided 
at any cost — a settlement which 
would quiet things down, destroy our 
will to resist, without changing any 
essential in the longer-range predic- 
tion of disaster. So I switched the 
subject and squelched possibility by 
being difficult about irrelevancies 
and politely offensive. Manuel, you 
and I know — and Adam knows — 
that there must be an end to food 
shipments. Nothing less will save 
Luna from disaster. But can you 
imagine a wheat farmer fighting 
to end those shipments?” 

“No. Wonder if can pick up news 
from home on how they’re taking 
stoppage?” 

“There won’t be any. Here is how 
Adam has timed it, Manuel: No an- 
nouncement is to be made on either 
planet until after we get home. We 
are still buying wheat. Barges are 
still arriving at Bombay.” 



“You told them shipments would 
stop at once.” 

“That was a threat, not a moral 
commitment. A few more loads 
won’t matter and we need time. We 
don’t have everyone on our side; 
we have only a minority. There is 
a majority who don’t care either way 
but can be swayed — temporarily. 
We have another minority against 
us . especially grain farmers 
whose interest is never politics but 
the price of wheat. They are grum- 
bling but accepting Scrip, hoping it 
will be worth face value later. But 
the instant we announce that ship- 
ments have stopped they will be 
actively against us. Adam plans to 
have the majority committed to us 
at the time the announcement is 
made.” 

“How long? One year? Two?” 
“Two days, three days, perhaps 
four. Carefully edited excerpts from 
that five-year plan, excerpts from 
the recordings you’ve made especial- 
ly that yellow-dog offer, exploitation 
ot your arrest in Kentucky — ” 

“Hey! I’d rather forget that.” 
Prof smiled and cocked an eye- 
brow, “Uh — ” I said uncomfortably, 
‘may. If will help.” 

“It will help more than any sta- 
tistics about natural resources.” 

W ired-up ex-human piloting us 
went in as one maneuver with- 
out bothering to orbit and gave us 
even heavier beating. Ship was light 
and lively. But change in motion is 
under two-and-a-half kilometers; was 
over in nineteen seconds and we 
were down at Johnson City. 

I took it right, just a terrible con-

striction in chest and a feeling as if 
giant were squeezing heart, then was 
over and I was gasping back to 
normal and glad to be proper weight. 
But did almost kill poor old Prof. 

Mike told me later that pilot re- 
fused to surrender control. Mike 
would have brought ship down in a 
low-gee, no-breakum-egg, knowing 
Prof was aboard. But perhaps that 
Cyborg knew what he was doing. A 
low-gee landing wastes mass and 
Lotus Lark grounded almost dry. 

None of which we cared about, 
as looked as if that Garrison landing 
had wasted Prof. Stu saw it while I 
was still gasping, then we were both 
at him — - heart stimulant, manual 
respiration, massage. At last he flut- 
tered eyelids, looked at us, smiled. 
**Home” he whispered. 

We made him rest twenty minutes 
before we let him suit up to leave 
ship; had been as near dead as can 
be and not hear angels. Skipper was 
filling tanks, anxious to get rid of 
us and take on passengers. That 
Dutchman never spoke to us whole 
trip; think he regretted lettting mon- 
ey talk him into a trip that could 
ruin or kill him. 

By then Wyoh was inside ship, p- 
suited to come to 'meet us. Don’t 
think Stu had ever seen her in a 
p-suit and certain he had never seen 
her as a blonde; did not recognize. 
I was hugging her in spite of p-suit; 
he was standing by, waiting to be 
introduced. Then strange “mail” in 
p-suit hugged him — he was sur- 
prised. 

Heard Wyoh’s muffled voice: “Oh 
heavens! Mannie, my helmet.” 

I undamped it, lifted off. She 



shook curls and grinned. “Stu, aren’t 
you glad to see me? Don’t you know 
me?” 

A grin spread over his face, slow- 
ly as dawn across maria. “Zdra’- 
stvooeet’ye, Gospazha! I am most 
happy to see you.” 

“^Gospazha’ indeed! I’m Wyoh 
to you, dear, always. Didn’t Mannie 
tell you I’d gone back to blonde?” 
“Yes, he did. But knowing it and 
seeing are not the same.” 

“You’ll get used to it.” She stop- 
ped to bend over Prof, kiss him, gig- 
gle at him, then straightened up and 
gave me a no-helmet welcome-home 
that left us both with tears despite 
pesky suit. Then turned again to Stu, 
started to kiss him. 

He held back a little. She stop- 
ped. “Stu, am I going to have to put 
on brown makeup to welcome you?” 
Stu glanced at me, then kissed her. 
Wyoh put m as much time and 
thought as she had to welcoming me. 

Was later I figured out his odd 
behavior. Stu, despite commitment, 
was still not a Loonie — and in 
meantime Wyoh had married. What’s 
that got to do with it? Well, Earth- 
side it makes a difference, and Stu 
did not know deep down in bones 
that a Loonie lady is own mistress. 
Poor chum thought V might take of- 
fense! 

We got Prof into suit, ourselves 
same, and left, me with cannon 
under arm. Once underground and 
locked through, we unsuited — and 
I was flattered to see that Wyoh was 
wearing crushed under p-suit that 
red dress I bought her ages ago. She 
brushed it and skirt flared out. 
Immigration room was empty save

for about forty men lined up along 
wall like new transportees; were 
wearing p-suits and carrying helmets 
— Terrans going home, stranded 
tourists and some scientists. Their 
p-suits would not go, would be un- 
loaded before lift. I looked at them 
and thought about Cyborg pilot. 
When Lark had been stripped, all 
but three couches had been remov- 
ed. These people were going to take 
acceleration lying on floorplates. if 
skipper was not careful he was going 
to have mashed Terrans au blut. 

Mentioned to Stu. “Forget it,” he 
said. “Captain Leures has foam pads 
aboard. He won’t let them be hurt; 
they’re his life insurance.” 

XXXV 

M y family, all thirty-odd from 
Grandpaw to babies, was wait- 
ing beyond next lock on level be- 
low aiKl we got cried on and slob- 
bered on and hugged. And this time 
Stu did not hold back. 

Little Hazel made ceremony of 
kissing us. She had Liberty Caps, 
set one on each, then kissed us — 
and at that signal whole family put 
on Liberty Caps, and I got sudden 
tears. Perhaps is wfhat patriotism 
feels like, choked up and so happy 
it hurl^. Or maybe was just being 
with my beloveds again. 

“Where’s Slim?” I asked Hazel. 
“Wasn’t he invited?” 

“Couldn’t come. He’s junior mar- 
shal of your reception.” 

“ ‘Reception?’ This is all we 
want.” 

“You’ll see.” 

Did. Good thing family came out 



to meet us; that and dde to L-City 
(filled a caipsuie) were all I saw of- 
them for some time. Tube Station 
West was a howliing mob, all in 
liberty Caps. We three were car- 
ried on shoulders all way to Old 
Dome, surrounded by a stilyagi 
bodyguard, elbows locked to force 
through cheering, singing crowds. 
Boys were wearing red caps and 
white shirts and their girls wore 
white jumpers and xed shorts color 
of caps. 

At station and again when they 
put us down in Old Dome I got 
kissed by ferns I have never seen 
before or since. Remember hoping 
that measures we had taken in lieu 
of quarantine were effective — or 
half of L-Oity would be down with 
colds or worse. (Apparently wc were 
dean; was no epidemic. But I re- 
member time — was quite small — 
when measles got loose and thou- 
sands died.) 

Worried about Prof, too. Recep- 
tion was too rough for a man good 
as dead an hour earlier. But he 
not only enjoyed it, he made a won- 
derful speech in Old E>ome — one 
short on logic, loaded with ringing 
phrases. “Love” was in it, and 
“home” and “Luna” and “com- 
rades” and “neighbors” and even 
“shoulder to sihoulder” and all 
sounded good. 

They had erected a platform un- 
der big news video on south face. 
Adam Selene greeted us from video 
screen and now Prof’s face and 
voice were projected from it, much 
magnified, over his head. Did not 
have to shout. But did have to 
pause after every sentence. Crowd 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



139 




roars drowned out even bull voice 
from screen — and no doubt pauses 
helped, as rest. But Prof no longer 
seemed old, tired, ill; being back 
inside The Rock seemed to be tonic 
he needed. And me, too! Was won- 
derful to be right weight, feel 
strong, breathe pure, replenished air 
of own dty. 

No mean city! Impossible to get 
all of L-City inside Old Dome — 
but looked as if they tried. I esti- 
mated an area ten meters square, 
tried to count heads, got over two" 
hundred not half through and gave 
up. Lunatic placed crowd at thirty 
thousand, seems impossible. 

Prof’s words reached more near- 
ly three million; video carried scene 
to those who could not crowd into 
Old Dome, cable and relay flashed 
it across lonely maria to all war- 
dens. He grabbed chance to tell of 
slave future Authority planned for 
them. Waved that ‘Vliite paper”. 
“Here it is!” he cried. “Your fet- 
ters! Your leg irons! Will you wear 
them?” 

‘Wo!” 

“They say you must. They say 
they will H-bomb . then sur- 
vivors will surrender and put on 
these chains. Will you?” 

‘WO/ NEVERr 

“ ‘Never,’ ” agreed Prof. “They 
threaten to send troops . more 
and more troops to rape and mur- 
der. We .shall fight them.” 

**DAr 

“We shall fight them on the 
surface, we shall fight them in the 
tubes, we shall fight them in the 
corridors! If die we must, we shall 
die freer 



•*Yes! Ja-da! Tell ’em, tell ’em!” 
“And if we die, let history write: 
This was Luna’s finest hour! Give us 
liberty ... or give us deathr 

S ome of that sounded familiar. But 
his words came out fresh and 
new; I joined in roars. Look ... I 
knew we couldn’t whip Terra — 
I’m tech by trade and know that 
an M-missile doesn’t care how brave 
you are. But was ready, too. If 
they wanted a fight, let’s have it! 

Prof let them roar, then led them 
in Battle Hymn of the Republic, 
Simon’s version. Adam appeared 
on screen again, took over leading 
it and sang with them, and we tried 
to slip away, off back of plat- 
form, with help of stilyagi led by 
Slim. But women didn’t want to let 
us go and lads aren’t at their best 
in trying to stop ladies; they broke 
through. Was twenty-two hundred 
before we four, Wyoh, Prof, Stu, 
self, were locked in room L of 
Raffles, wihere Adam-Mike joined 
us by video. I was starved by then, 
all were, so T ordered dinner and 
Prof insisted that we eat before re- 
viewing plans. 

Then we got down to business. 
Adam started by asking me to 
read aloud “white paper”, for his 
benefit and for Comrade Wyom- 
ing. “But first. Comrade Manuel, if 
you have the recordings you made 
Earthside, could you transmit them 
by phone at high speed to my 
office? I’ll have them transcribed 
for study. All I have so far arc 
the coded summaries Comrade 
Stuart sent up.” 

I did so, knowing Mike would

study them at once, phrasing was 
part of **Adiam Seiene” myth — and 
decided to talk to Prof about let- 
ting Stu in on the facts. If Stu was 
lo be in executive cell, pretending 
was too dumsy. 

Feeding recordings into Mike at 
overspeed took five minutes, read- 
ing aloud another thirty. That done, 
Adam said, “Professor, the recep- 
tion was more successful than I 
had counted on, due to your speech, 
I think we should push the embargo 
through Congress at once. I can 
send out a call tonight for a session 
to begin at noon tomorrow. Com- 
ments?” 

I said, “Look, those yammer- 
heads will kick it around for weeks. 
If you rmist put it up to them — 
can’t see why — do as you did with 
Declaration. Start late, jam it 
through after midnight using own 
people.” 

Adam said, “Sorry, Manuel. Fm 
getting caught up on events Earth- 
side and you have catching up 
to do here. It’s no longer the same 
group. Comrade Wyoming?” 

“Mannie dear, it’s an elected Con- 
gress now. They must pass it. Con- 
gress is what government we have 
for Luna.” 

I said slowly, “You held election 
and turned things over to them? 
Everything? Then what arc we do- 
ing?” Looked at Prof, expecting 
explosion. My objections would not 
be on his grounds — but couldn’t 
see any use in swapping one talk- 
talk for another. At least first group 
had been so loose we could pack 
ft. This new group would be glued 
to seats. 



P rof was undisturbed. Fitted fin- 
gertips together and looked re- 
laxed. “Manuel, I don’t think the 
situation is as bad as you seem to 
feel it is. In each stage it is neces- 
sary to adapt to the popular myth- 
ology. At one time kings were an- 
ointed by Deity, so the problem 
was to see to it that Deity an- 
ointed the right candidate. In this 
age the myth is ‘the will of the 
people’ . but the problem changes 
cmly superficially. Comrade Adam 
and I have had long discussions 
about how to determine the will of 
the people. I venture to suggest 
that this solution is one we can 
work with.” 

“Well . okay. But why weren’t 
we told? Stu, did you know?” 
“No, Mannie. There was no 
reason to tell me.” He shrugged. 
“I’m a monarchist. I wouldn’t have 
been interested. But I go along with 
Prof that in this day and age elec- 
tions are a necessary ritual.” 

Prof said, “Manud, if wasn’t 
necessary to tell us till we got back. 
You and I had other work to do. 
Comrade Adam and dear Comrade 
Wyoming handled it in our ab- 
sence ... so let’s find out what 
they did before we judge what 
they’ve done.” 

“Sorry. Well, Wyoh?” 

“Mannie, we didn’t leave every- 
thing to chance. Adam and I de- 
cided that a Congress of three 
hundred would be about right. Then 
we spent hours going over the Par- 
ty lists — plus prominent people not 
in the Party. At last we had a list 
of candidates — a list that included 
some from the Ad-Hoc Congress. 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



141 




Not all were yammeriheads. We in- 
cluded as many as we coiild. Tliea 
Adam phoned each one and asked 
him — OT her — if he would serve 
. binding him to secrecy in the 
meantime. Some we had to re- 
place. 

“When we were ready, Adam 
spoke cm video, announced that it 
was time to carry out the Party’s 
pledge of free elections, set a date, 
said that everybody over sixteen 
could vote, and that all anyone had 
to do to be a candidate was to get 
a hundred chops on a nominating 
petition and post it in Old Dome, 
or the public notice place for his 
warren. Oh, yes, thirty temporary 
election districts, ten Congressmen 
from each district. That let all but 
the smallest warrens be at least one 
district.” 

“So you had it lined up and 
Party ticket went through?” 

“Oh, no, dear! There wasn’t any 
Party ticket — officially. But we 
were ready with our candidates . 
and I must say my stilyagi did a 
smart job of getting chops on nom- 
inations. Our optings were posted 
the first day. Many other people 
posted; there were over two thou- 
sand candidates. But there was only 
ten days from announcement to 
election, and we knew what we 
wanted whereas the opposition was 
split up. It wasn’t necessary for 
Adam to come out jHiblicly and en- 
dorse candidates. It worked out — 
you won by seven thousand votes, 
dear, while your nearest rivals got 
less than a thousand.” 

“7 won?” 

“You won, I won, Professor wem, 



Comrade Clayton won, and just 
about everybody we thought should 
be in the Congress. It wasn’t hard. 
Although Adam never endorsed any- 
one, I didn’t hesitate to let our com- 
rades know who was favored. Simon 
poked his finger in, too. And we 
do have good connections with 
newspapers. I wish you had been 
here election night, watching the 
results. Exciting!” 

“How did you go about nose 
counting? Never known how elec- 
tion works. Write names on a piece 
of paper?” 

“Oh, no, we used a better system 
. because, after all, some of our 
best people can’t write. We used 
banks for voting places, with bank 
clerks identifying customers and 
customers identifying members of 
their families and neighbors who 
don’t have bank accounts. People 
voted orally and the clerks punched 
the votes into the banks’ compu- 
ters with the voter watching, and 
results were all tallied at once in 
Luna City clearing house. We voted 
everybody in less than three hours 
and results were printed out just 
minutes after voting stopped.” 

S uddenly a light came on ki my 
skuH and I decided to question 
Wyoh privately. No, not Wyoh — 
Mike. Get past bis “Adam Se- 
lene” dignity and hammer truth out 
of his neuristors. Recalled a cheque 
ten million billion dollars too large 
and wondered how many had voted 
for me? Seven thousand? Seven 
hundred? Or just my family and 
friends? 

But no longer worried about new

Congress. Prof had not slipped them 
a cold deck but one that was frozen 
solid — then ducked Eairthside while 
crime was committed. No us ask- 
ing Wyoh; she didn’t even need 
to know what Mike had done . 
and could do her part better if 
did not suspect. 

Nor would anybody suspect. If 
was one thing all people took for 
granted, was conviction that if you 
feed honest figures into a compu- 
ter, honest figures' come out. Never 
doubted it myself till I met a com- 
puter with a sense of humor. 

Changed my mind about suggest- 
ing that Stu be let in on Mike’s 
self-awareness. Three was too 
many. Or perhaps too few. “Mi — ” I 
started to say, and changed to: 
“My word! Sounds efficient. How 
big did we win?” 

Adam answered without expres- 
sion. “Eighty-six per cent of our 
candidates were successful. Ap- 
proximately what I had expected.” 

(“Approximately,” my false left 
arm! Exactly what you expected, 
Mike old ironmongery!) “Withdraw 
objection to a noon session — I’ll 
be there.” 

“It seems to me,” said Stu, “as- 
suming that the embargo starts at 
once, we will need something to 
maintain the enthusiasm we wit- 
nessed tonight. Or there will be a 
long quiet period of increasing 
economic depression — from the 
embargo, I mean — and growing 
disillusionment. Adam, you first 
impressed me through your ability 
to make shrewd guesses as to future 
events. Do my misgivings make 
sense?” 



“They do.” 

“Well?” 

Adam looked at us in turn, and 
was almost impossible to believe 
that this was a false imjage and 
Mike was simply placing us through 
binaural receptors. “Comrades . 
it must be turned into open war 
as quickly as possible.” 

Nobody said anything. One thing 
to talk about war, another to face 
up to it. At last I sighed and said, 
“When do we start throwing 
rocks?” 

“We do not start,” Adam an- 
swered. “They must throw the first 
one. How do we antagonize them 
into doing so? I will reserve my 
thoughts to the last. Comrade Man- 
uel?” 

“Uh . don’t look at me. Way I 
feel, would start with a nice big 
rock smash at Agra — a bloke there 
who is a waste of space. But is not 
what you are after.” 

“No, it is not.” Adam answered 
seriously. “You would not only 
anger the entire Hindu nation, a 
people intensely opposed to des- 
truction of life, but you would 
also anger and shock people 
throughout Earth by destroying the 
Taj Mahal.” 

“Including me,” said Prof. “Don’t 
talk dirty, Manuel.” 

“Look,” I said, “didn’t say to do 
it. Anyhow, could miss Taj.” 

4 4]V yTanuel,” said Prof, “as Adam

politiok. The question is howl 
Adam, I suggest that wihat is needed 
k to plant the idea that we are 
weak and divided and that all it 
takes is a show of force to bring 
us back into line. Stu? Your people 
Earthside should be useful. Sup- 
pose the Congress repudiated my- 
self and Manuel? The effect?” 

“Oh, nor said Wyoh, 

“Oh, yes, dear Wyo-h. Not neces- 
sary to do it but simply to put it 
over news channels to Earth. Per- 
haps still better to put it out over 
a clandestine beam attributed to 
the Terran scientists still with us 
while our official channels display 
the classic stigmata of tight cen- 
sorship. Adam?” 

“I’m noting it as a tactic which 
probably will be included in the 
strategy. But it will not be sufficient 
alone. We must be bombed.” 

“Adam,” said Wyoh, “why do 
you say so? Even if Luna City can 
stand up under their biggest bombs 
— something I hope never to find 
out — we know that Luna can’t 
win an all-out war. You’ve said so, 
many times. Isn’t there some way 
to work it so that they will just 
plain leave us alone?” 

Adam pulled at right cheek — 
and I thought: Mike, if you don’t 
knock off play-acting, you’ll have 
me believing in you myself. Was 
annoyed at hkn and looked forward 
to a talk — one in which I would 
not have to defer to “Chairman 
Selene.” 

“Comrade Wyoming,” he said 
soberly, “it’s a matter of game 
theory in a complex non-zero-sum 
game. We have certain resources or 



‘pieces in the game’ and many possi- 
ble moves. Our opponents have 
much larger resources and a far 
larger spectrum of responses. Our 
problem is to manipulate the game 
so that our strength is utilized 
toward an optimax sc^ution while 
inducing them to waste their super- 
ior strength and to refrain from 
using it at maximum. Timing is of 
the essense and a gamibit is neces- 
sary to start a chain of events favor- 
able to our strategy. I realize this 
is not dear. I could put the fac- 
tors through a comiputer and show 
you. Or you can accept the con- 
clusion. Or you can use your own 
judgment.” 

He was reminding Wyoh (under 
Stu’s nose) that he was not “Adam 
Selene” but Mike, our dinkum think- 
um who could handle so complex a 
problem because he was a comiputer 
and smartest one anywhere. 

Wyoh backtracked. “No, no,” she 
said, “I wouldn’t understand the 
math. Okay, it has to be done. 
How do we do it?” 

Was four hundred before we had 
a plan that suited Prof and Stu 
as well as Adam — or took that 
long for Mike to sell his plan while 
appearing to pull ideas out of rest 
of us. Or was it Prof’s plan with 
“Adam Selene” as salesman? 

In any case we had a plan and 
master strategy of Tuesday 14 May 
2075 and varied from it only to 
calendar, one that grew out of 
match events as they actually had 
occurred. In essence it call^ for 
us to beihave as narstily as possible 
while strengthening impression that 
we would be awfuHy easy to spank.

W as at Community Hall at 
noon, after too little sleep, 
and found I could have dept two 
hours longer; Congressmen from 
Hong Kong could not make it that 
early despite tube all way. Wyoh 
did not bang gavel until fourteen- 
thirty. 

Yes, my bride wife was chairman 
pro tern in a body not yet organized. 
Parliamentary rulings seemed to 
come naturally to her, and she was 
not a bad choice. A mob of Loonies 
behave better when a lady bangs 
gavel. 

Not going to detail what new 
Congress did and said that session 
and later. Minutes are available. I 
showed up only when necessary and 
never bothered to learn tailk-taik 
rules — seemed to be equal parts 
common politeness and ways in 
which chaiiman could invoke magic 
to do it his (her) way. 

No sooner had Wyoh banged 
them to order but a cobber jumped 
up and said, “Gospazha Chairman, 
move we suspend rules and hear 
from Comrade Professor de la Paz!” 
— which brought a whoop of ap- 
proval. 

Wyoh banged again. “Motion is 
out of order and Member from 
Lower Churchill will be seated. This 
house recessed without adjourning 
and Chairman of Committee on 
Permanent Organization, Resolu- 
tions and Government Structure 
still has the floor.” 

Turned out to be Wolfgang Kor- 
sakov, Member from Tycho Under 
(and a member of Profs cell and 



our number-one finagler of LuNo- 
HoCo) and he not only had floor, 
he had it all day, yielding time as 
he saw fit (i.e, picking out whom 
he wanted to speak rather than let- 
ting just anyone talk). But nobody 
was too irked. This mob seemed 
satisfied with leadership. Were 
noisy but unruly. 

By dinnertime Luna had a gov- 
ernment to replace co-opted pro- 
visional government — i.e., dummy 
government we had opted ourselvs, 
which sent Prof and, me to Earth. 
Congress confirmed ail acts of pro- 
visional government, thus putting 
face on what we had done, thanked 
outgoing government for services 
and instructed Wolfgang’s commit- 
tee to continue work on permanent 
government structure. 

Prof was elected President of Con- 
gress and ex-officio Prime Minister 
of interim government until we ac- 
quired a constitution. He protested 
age and health . then said would 
serve if could have certain things 
to help him; too old and too ex- 
hausted from trip Earthside to have 
responsibility of presiding — except 
on occasions of state — so he want- 
ed Congress to elect a Speaker and 
Speaker Pro Tern. And besides that, 
he felt Congress should augment its 
numbers by not more than ten per 
cent by itself electing mombers-at- 
large so that Prime Minister, who- 
ever he might be, could opt cab- 
inet members or ministers of state 
who might not now be members of 
Congress — especially minister-with- 
out-portfolio to take load off his 
shoulders. 

Tbey balked. Most were proud 



146 



IF 




of being “Congressmen” and already 
jealous of status. But Prof just sat 
kx>king tired, and waited — and 
somebody pointed out that it still 
left control in hands of Congress. 
So they gave him what he asked 
for. 

Then somebody squeezed in a 
speech by making it a question to 
chair. Everybody knew (he said) 
that Adam Selene had refrained 
from standing for Congress on 
grounds that Chaiiman of Emergen- 
cy Committee should not take ad- 
vantage of position to elbow way 
into new government . but could 
Honorable Chairlady tell member 
whether was any reason not to elect 
Adam Selene a member-at-large? As 
gesture of appreciation for great ser- 
vices? To let all Luna — yes, and 
all those earthworms, especially ex- 
Lunar ex-Authority — know that 
we were not repudiating Adam 
Selene. On contrary he was our be- 
loved elder statesman and was not 
President simply because he chose 
not to be! 

More whoops that went on and 
on. You can find in minutes who 
made that speech but one gets you 
ten Prof wrote it and Wyoh planted 
it. 

H ere is how it wound up, over 
course of days; 

Prime Minister and Secretary of 
State for Foreign Affairs: Professor 
Bernardo de la Paz. 

Speaker, Finn Nielsen; Speaker 
Pro Tern, Wyoming Davis. 

Undersecretary of State for 
Foreign Affairs and Minister of 
Defense, General O’Kelly Davis; 



Minister of Information, Ter- 
ence Sheehan (Sheenie turned Prav- 
da over to managing editor to work 
with Adam and Stu); Special Min- 
ister-without-Portfolio in Ministry of 
Information, Stuart Rene LaJoie, 
Congressman-at-Large; Secretary of 
State for Economics and Finance 
(and Custodian of Enemy Proper- 
ty), Wolfgang Korsakov; Minister 
of Interior Affairs and Slafety, Com- 
rade “Clayton” Watenabe; Minister- 
without-Portfolio and Special Advi- 
ser to Prime Minister, “Adam Se- 
lene” plus a dozen minis-ters and 
ministers-without-pK>rtfolio from 
warrens other than Luna City. 

See where that left things? Brush 
away fancy titles and “B” Cell was 
still running things as advised by 
Mike, backed by a Congress in 
which we could not lose a test vote. 
But did lose others we did not want 
to win, or did not care about. 

But at time could not see sense 
in all that talk- talk. 

During evening session Prof re- 
ported on trip and then yielded to 
me — Committee Chairman Korsa- 
kov consenting — so that I could 
report what “five-year plan” meant 
and how Authority had tried to 
bribe me. I’ll never make a sipeaker 
but had time during dinner break 
to swot speech Mike had written. 
He had slanted it so narstily that I 
got angry all over again and was 
angry when I spoke and managed to 
make it catching. Congress was 
ready to riot by time I sat down. 

Prof stepped forward, thin and 
pale, and said quietly, “Comrade 
Members, what shall we do? I sug- 
gest, Chairman Korsakov consenting, 



"^l!E MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



147 




lhat we discuss informally how to 
lieai this latest insolence to our na- 
tion.” 

One member from Novylen want- 
ed to declare war and they would 
have done so right then if ^o-f had 
not pointed out that they were still 
hearing committee reports. 

More talk, all bitter. At last Com- 
mde Member Chang Jones spoke: 
“Fellow Congressmen — sorry, Gos- 
podin Chairman Korsakov — I’m a 
rice and wheat farmer. Mean I used 
to be, because back in May I got 
a bank loan and sons and I are con- 
verting to variety farming. We’re 
broke — had to borrow tube fare to 
get here — but family is eating and 
someday we might pull square with 
bank. At least I’m no longer raising 
grain. 

“But others are. Catapult has 
never reduced headway by one 
barge whole time we’ve been free. 
We’re still shipping, hoping their 
cheques will be worth something 
someday. 

“But now we know! They’ve told 
us what they mean to do with us — 
to us! I say only way to make those 
scoundrels know we mean business 
is stop shipments right now! Not an- 
other tonne, not a kilo . until 
they come here and dicker honestly 
for honest price!” 

Around midnight they passed Em- 
bargo, then adjourned subject to call 
. standing comimittees to continue. 

Wyoh and I went home, and I go-t 
reacquainted with my family. Was 
nothing to do; Mike-Adam and Stu 
had been working on how to hit 
them with it Earthside and Mike 
had shut catapult down (“technical 



difficulties with ballistic computer” ) 
twenty-four hours earlier. Last barge 
in trajectory would be taken by 
Poona Ground Control in slightly 
over one day and Earth would be 
told narstily that was last they 
would ever get. 

XXXVII 

S hock to farmers was eased by 
continuing to buy grain at cata- 
pult — but cheques now carried 
printed warning that Luna Free 
State did not stand behind them, did 
not warrant that Lunar Authority 
would ever redeem them even in 
Scrip, etc., etc. Some farmers left 
grain anyhow, some did not, all 
screamed. But was nothing they 
could do. Catapult was shut down, 
loading belts not moving. 

Depression was not immediately 
felt in rest of economy. Defense 
regiments had depleted ranks of ice 
miners so much that selling ice on 
free market was profitable. LuNoHo 
Co steel subsidiary was hiring 
every able-bodied man it could find, 
and Wolfgang Korsakov was ready 
with paper money, “National Dol- 
lars,” printed to resemble Hong Kong 
dollar and in theory pegged to it. 
Luna had plenty of food, plenty of 
work, plenty of money. People were 
not hurting. “Beer, betting, women 
and work” went on as usual. 

“Nationals,” as they were called, 
were inflation money, war money, 
fiat money, and were discounted a 
fraction of a percent on day of first 
issue, concealed as “exchange ser- 
vice charge.” They were spendable 
money and never did drop to zero 



148 



IF 




but were infiaitionary and exchange 
lefleoted it increasingly. New gov- 
emment was spending money it did 
not have. 

But that was later. 

Challenge to Earth, to Authority 
and Federated Nations, was made 
intentionally narsty. F.N vessels 
were ordered to stay clear of Luna 
by ten diameters and not orbit at 
any distance under pain of being 
destroyed without warning. (No 
mention of hoWy since we could 
not.) Vessels of private registry 
would be permitted to land if (a) 
permission was requested ahead of 
time with ballistic plan, (b) a ves- 
sel thus cleared placed itself under 
Luna Ground Control (Mike) at a 
distance of one hundred thousand 
kilometers while foilowing approved 
trajectory and (c) was unarmed save 
for three hand guns permitted three 
officers. Last was to be confirmed 
by inspection on landing before any- 
body was allowed to leave ship and 
before ship was serviced with fuel 
and/or reaction mass. Violation 
would mean confiscation of ship. No 
person allowed to land at Luna other 
than ship’s crew in connection with 
loading, unloading, or servicing save 
citizens of Terran countries who had 
recognized Free Luna. (Only Chad 
— and Chad had no ships. Prof ex- 
pected some private vessels to be 
reregistered under Chad merchant 
flag.) 

Manifesto noted that Terran sci- 
entists still in Luna could return 
home in any vessel which conform- 
ed to our requirements. It invited 
all freedom-loving Terran nations to 
denounce wrongs done us and which 



the Authority planned against us, 
recognize us and enjoy free trade 
and full intercourse — and pointed 
out that there were no tariffs or 
any artificial restrictions against 
trade in Luna, and was policy of 
Luna government to keep it that 
way. We invited immigration^ un- 
limited, and pointed out that we had 
a labor shortage and any immigrant 
could be self-supporting at once. 

W e also boasted of food — adult 
consumption over four thou- 
sand calories per day, high in pro- 
tein, low in cost, no rationing. (Stu 
had Adam-Mike stick in price of 
100-proof vodka — fifty cents 
HKL per liter, less in quantity, no 
taxes. Since this was less than one- 
tenth retail price of 80-proof vodka 
in North America, Stu knew it 
would hit home. Adam, “by nature” 
a teetotaler, hadn’t thought of it. 
One of Mike’s few oversights.) 

Lunar Authority was invited to 
gather at one spot well away from 
other people, say in unirrigated part 
of Sahara, and received one last 
barge of grain free — straight down 
at terminal velocity. This was fol- 
lowed by a snotty lecture which im- 
plied that we were prepared to do 
same to anyone who threatened our 
peace, there being a number of 
loaded barges at catapult head, ready 
for such unceremonious delivery. 
Then we waited. 

But we waited busily. Were in- 
deed a few loaded barges. These 
we unloaded and reloaded with rock 
with changes made in guidance 
transponders so that Poona Control 
could not affect them. Their retros 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



149 




were removed, leaving only lateral 
thrustors, and spare retros were 
taken to new catapult, to be modi- 
fied for lateral guidance. Greatest 
effort went into moving steel to 
new catapult and shaping it into 
jackets for solid rock cylinders. Steel 
was bottleneck. 

Two days after our manifesto a 
“clandestine” radio started beaming 
to Terra. Was weak and tended to 
fade and was supposed to be con- 
cealed, presumably in a crater, and 
could be worked only certain hours 
until brave Terran scientists manag- 
ed to rig automatic repeat. Was near 
frequency of “Voice of Free Luna” 
which tended to drown it out with 
brassy boasts. 

Terrans remaining in Luna had 
BO chance to make signals. Those 
who had chosen to stick with re- 
search were chaperoned by stilyagi 
every instant and locked into bar- 
racks to sleep. 

But “clandestine” station man- 
aged to get “truth” to Terra. Prof 
had been tried for deviationism and 
was under house arrest. I had been 
executed for treason. Hong Kong 
Luna had pulled out, declared self 
separately independent . might be 
open to reason. Rioting in Novylen. 
All food growing had been collec- 
tivized and black^market eggs were 
selling for three dollars apiece in 
Luna City. Battalions of female 
troopvs were being enlisted, each 
sworn, to kill at least one Terran, 
and were drilling with fake guns in 
corridors of Luna City. 

Last was an almost-true. Many 
ladies wanted to do something mili- 
tant and had formed a Home De- 



fense Guard, “Ladies from Hades.” 
But their drills were of a very prac- 
tical nature — and Hazel was sulk- 
ing because Mum had not allowed 
her to join. Then she got over sulks 
and started “Stilyagi Debs,” a very 
junior home guard which drilled af- 
ter school hours, did not use wea- 
pons, concentrated on backing up 
stilyagi air & pressure corps, and 
practiced first aid — and own no- 
weapons fighting, which — possibly 
— Mum never learned. 

1 don't know how much to tell. 

Can’t tell all but stuff in history 
books is so wrong. 

I was no better a “defense min- 
ister” than “congressman.” Not 
apologizing, had no training for eith- 
er. Revolution is an amateur thing 
for almost everybody; Prof was only 
one who seemed to know what he 
was doing, and, at that, was new 
to him, too. He had never taken 
part in a successful revolution or 
ever been part of a government, 
much less head. 

As Minister of Defense I could 
not see many ways to defend ex- 
cept for steps already taken, that is, 
stilyagi air squads in warrens and 
laser gunners around ballistic radars. 
If F.N. decided to bomb, didn’t see 
any way to stop them. Wasn’t an 
interception missile in all Luna. And 
that’s not a gadget you whomp up 
from bits and pieces. My word, wo 
couldn’t even make fusion weapons 
with which such a rocket is tipped. 

But I went through motions. Ask- 
ed same Chinee engineers who had 
built laserguns to take a crack at 
problem of intercepting bombs or 



150 



IF 




missiles — one same problem save 
th^ a missile comes at you faster. 

Then turned attention to other 
things. Simply hoped that F.N. 
would never bomb warrens. 

Some warrens, L-City in particu- 
lar, were so deep down that they 
could probably stand direct hits. 
One cubic, lowest level of Complex 
where central part of Mike lived, 
bad been designed to withstand 
bombing. On other hand Tycho Un- 
der was a big natural bubble cave 
like Old Dome and roof was only 
meters thick; sealer on under side 
was kept warm with hot water pipes 
to make sure new cracks sealed — 
would not take much of a bomb to 
crack TyCho Under. 

But is no limit to how big a 
fusion bomb can be. F.N. could 
bufld one big enough to smash L- 
City — or theoretically even a 
Doomsday job that would split Luna 
like a melon and finish job some 
asteroid started at Tycho. If they 
did, couldn’t see any way to stop 
them, so didn’t worry. 

Instead put time on problems I 
could manage, helping at new cata- 
pult, trying to work up better aim- 
ing arrangements for laser drills 
around radars (and trying to get 
drfflmen to stick; half of them quit 
once price of ice went up), trying 
to arrange decentralized stand-by 
engineering controls for all warrens. 
M^ke did designing on this. We grab- 
bed every general-purpose computer 
we could find (paying in “nation- 
als** with ink barely dry), and I 
turned job over to McIntyre, former 
dnef engineer for Authority. Was a 
job within his talents and I couldn’t 



do all rewiring and so forth, even 
if had tried. 

Held out biggest computer, one 
that did accounting for Bank of 
Hong Kong in Luna and also was 
clearing house there. Looked over its 
instruction manuals and decided was 
a smart computer for one that could 
not talk, so asked Mike if he could 
teach it ballistics? We made tempo- 
rary link-ups to let two machines get 
acquainted and Mike reported it 
could learn simple job we wanted 
it for — standby for new catapult 
— although Mike would not care 
to ride in ship controlled by it; was 
too matter-of-fact and. uncritical. 
Stupid, really. 

W ell, didn’t want it to w'histle 
tunes or crack jokes. Just 
wanted it to shove loads out of cata- 
pult at right millisecond and at cor- 
rect velocity, then watch load ap- 
proach Terra and give a nudge. 

HK Bank was not anxious to sell. 
But we had patriots on their board, 
wt promised to return it when 
emergency was over, and moved it 
to new site — by rolligon, too big for 
tubes. Took all one dark semi-lunar. 
Had to jerry-rig a big airlock to get 
it out of Kong warren. I hooked 
it to Mike again and he undertook 
to teach art of ballistics against pos- 
sibility that his linkage to new site 
might be cut in an attack. 

(You know what bank used to 
replace computer? Two hundred 
clerks working abacuses. Abacusi? 
You know, shpsticks with beads, 
oldest digital computer, so far back 
in pre-history that nobody knows 
wtho invented. Russki and Chinee 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

*Dd Nips have always used them, 
and small shops today.) 

Trying to improve laser drills into 
space-defense weapons was easier 
but less straightforward. We had to 
leave them mounted on original 
cradles; was neither time, steel nor 
metalsmiths to start fresh. So we 
concentrated on better aiming ar- 
rangements. Call went out for tele- 
scopes. Scarce — what con fetches 
along a spyglass when transported? 
What market later to create supply? 
Surveying instruments and helmet 
binoculars were all we turned up, 
plus optical instruments confiscated 
in Terran labs. But we managed to 
equip drills with low--power big-field 
sights to coach-on with and high- 
power scopes for fine sighting, plus 
train and elevation circles and 
phones so that Mike could tell them 
where to point. Four drills we 
equipped with self-synchronous re- 
peater drives so that Mike could 
control them himself. Liberated 
these selsyns at Richardson; astro- 
nomers used them for Bausch cam- 
eras and Schmidts in sky mapping. 

But big problem was men. Wasn’t 
money, we kept upping wages. No, a 
drillman likes to work or wouldn’t 
be in that trade. Standing by in a 
ready room day after day, waiting 
for alert that always turns out to 
be just another practice — drove 
’em crackers.. They quit. One day in 
September I pulled an alert and got 
only seven drills manned. 

Talked it over with Wyoh and 
Sidris that night. Next day Wyoh 
wanted to know if Prof and I would 
okay bolshoi expense money? They 
fornied something Wyoh named 



“Lysistrata Corps.” Never inquired 
into duties or cost, because next time 
I inspected a ready room found three 
girls and no shortage of drillmen. 
Girls were in uniform of Second 
Defense Gunners just as men were 
(drillmen hadn’t bothered much 
with authorized uniform up to then) 
and one girl was wearing sergeant’s 
stripes with gun captain’s badge. 

I made that inspection very short. 
Most girls don’t have muscle to be 
a drillman and I doubted if this girl 
could wrestle a drill well ‘enough to 
justify that badge. But regular gun 
captain was on job, was no harm in 
girls learning to handle lasers, mor- 
ale was obviously high; I gave mat- 
ter no more worry. 

XXXVIII 

P rof underrated his new Congress. 

Am sure he never wanted any- 
thing but a body which would rub- 
berchop what we were doing and 
thereby do make it “voice of peo- 
ple.’’ But fact that new Congress- 
men were not yammerheads result- 
ed in them doing more than Prof 
intended. Especially Committee on 
Permanent Organization, Resolu- 
tions, and Government Structure. 

Got out of hand because we were 
all trying to do too much. Perman- 
ent heads of Congress were Prof, 
Finn Nielsen and Wyoh. Prof 
showed up only when he wanted to 
speak to them — seldom. He spent 
time with Mike on plans and an- 
alysis (odds shortened to one in 
five during September), time with 
Stu and Shennie Sheehan on pro- 
paganda, controlling official news to 



152 



IF 




Eartliside, very different “news” 
that went via “clandestine” radio, 
and reslanting news that came up 
from Earthside. Besides that he 
had finger in everything. I reported 
to him once a day, and all minis- 
tries both real and dummy did 
same. 

I kept Finn Nielsen busy; he was 
my “Commander of Aimed Forc- 
es”. He had his lasergun infantry 
to supervise — six men with cap- 
tured weapons on day we nabbed 
warden, now eight hundred scat- 
tered all through Luna and armed 
with Kongville monkey copies. Be- 
sides that, Wyoh’s organizations, 
Stilyagi Air Corps, Stlyagi Debs, 
Ladies from Hades, Irregulars (kept 
for morale and renamed Peter Pan’s 
Pirates) and Lysistrata Corps — 
all these halfway-military groups re- 
ported through Wyoh to Finn. I 
shoved it onto him. I had oth^ 
problems, such as trying to be a 
computer mechanic as well as a 
“statesman” when jobs such as in- 
stalling that computer at new cata- 
pult site had to be done. 

Besides which, I am not an exe- 
cutive and Finn had talent for it. 
I shoved First and Second Defense 
Gunners under him, too. But first 
I decided that these two skeleton 
regiments were a “brigade” and 
made Judge Brody a “brigadier.” 
Brody knew as much about mili- 
tary matters as I did — zero. But 
was widely known, highly respected, 
had unliimited hard sense — and 
had been a drillman before he lost 
leg. Finn was not a drillman, so 
couldn’t be placed directly over 



them; they wouldn’t have listened. 
I thought about using my co-hus- 
band Greg. But Greg was needed 
at Mare Undarum catapult, was only 
mechanic who had followed every 
phase of construction. 

Wyoh helped Prof, helped Stu, 
had her own organization, made 
trips out to Mare Undarum-^ and 
had little time to preside over Con- 
gress; task fell on senior committee 
chairman. Wolf Korsakov . who 
was busier than any of us; LuNo- 
HoCo was running everything Auth- 
ority used to run and many new 
things as well. 

Wolf had a good committee. Prof 
should have kept closer eye on k. 
Wolf had caus^ his boss, Moshai 
Baum, to be elected vice chairman 
and had in all seriousness outlined 
for his committee iM’oblem of de- 
termining wihat permanent govern- 
ment should be. Then Wolf had 
turned back on it. 

Those busy laddies split up and 
did it — studied forms of govern- 
ment in Carnegie Library, held sub- 
committee meetings, three or four 
people at a time (few enough to 
worry Prof ^d he known) — and 
when Congress met early in Sep- 
tember to ratify some appointments 
and elect more congressmen-at-large, 
instead of adjourning. Comrade 
Baum had gavel and they recessed 
— and met again and turned selves 
into committee-of-the-whole and 
passed a resolution and next thing 
we knew entire Congress was a 
Constitutional Convention divided 
into working groups headed by those 
subcommittees . 



TH€ MOON IS A HARSH. MISTRESS 



153 




I think Prof was shocked. But he 
couldn’t undo it, had all been 
proper under rules he himself had 
written. But he rolled with punch, 
went to Novylen (where Congress 
now met — more central) and spoke 
to them with usual good nature and 
simply cast doubts on what they 
were doing rather than telling them 
flatly they were wrong. 

After gracefully thanking them 
he started picking early drafts to 
pieces: 

“Comrade Members, like fire and 
fusion, government is a dangerous 
servant and a terrible master. You 
now have freedom — if you can 
keep it. But do remember that you 
can lose this freedom more quickly 
to yourselves than to any tyrant. 
Move slowly, be hesistant, puzzle 
out the consequences of every word. 
I would not be unhappy if this 
convention sat for ten years be- 
fore reporting — but I would be 
frightened if you took less than a 
year. 

“Distrust the obvious, suspect the 
traditional . for in the past 
mankind has not done well when 
saddling itself with governments. 
For example, I note m one draft re- 
port a proposal for setting up a 
commission to divide Luna into con- 
gressional districts and to reappor- 
tion them from time to time ac- 
cording to population. 

“This is. the traditional way. 
Therefore it should be suspect, con- 
sidered guilty until proved innocent. 
Perhaps you feel that this is the 
on/y way. May I suggest others? 
Surely w'here a man lives is the 
least important thing about him. 



Constituencies might be formed by 
dividing people by occupation . 
or by age ... or even alphabeti- 
cally. Or they might not be divided, 
every member elected at large. And 
do not object that this would make 
k impossible for any man not wide- 
ly known throughout Luna to be 
elected; that might be the best possi- 
ble thing for Luna. 

“You might even consider instal- 
ling the candidates who receive the 
least number of votes; unpopular

you from a new tyrann^". Don’t re- 
ject the idea merely because it 
seems preposterous — think about it! 
In past history popularly-elected 
governments have been no better 
and sometimes far worse than overt 
tyrannies. 

4 4X)ut if representative govern- 
ment turns out to be your in- 
tention there still may be ways to 
achieve it better than the territorial 
district. For example you each rep- 
resent about ten thousand human 
beings, perhaps seven thousand of 
voting age — and some of you were 
elected by slim majorities. Suppose 
instead ^ election a man\ were 
qualified for office by petition 
Mgned by four thousand citizens. He 
would then represent those four 
thousand affirmatively, with no dis- 
gruntled minority, for what would 
have been a minority in a territorial 
constituency would all be free to 
start other petitions or join in them. 
All would then be represented by 
men of their choice. Or a man with 
eight thousand supporters might 
have two votes in this body. Diffi-

culties, objections, practical points 
to be worked out — many of them! 
But you could work them out . 
and thereby the chronic sickness 
of representative government, the 
disgruntled minority which feels — 
correctly — that it has been disen- 
franchised. 

“But, whatever you do, do not 
let the past be a straight jacket! 

“I note one proposal to make 
this Congress a two-house body. Ex- 
cellent — the more impediments to 
legislation the better. But, instead 
of following tradition, I suggest one 
house of legislators, another whose 
single duty is to repeal laws. Let 
the legislators pass laws only with 
a two-thirds majority . while the 
repealers are able to cancel any 
law through a mere one-third min- 
ority. Preposterous? Think about it. 
If a bill is so poor that it cannot 
command two-thirds of your con- 
sents, is it not likely that it would 
make a poor law? And if a law is 
disliked by as many as one-third is 
it not likely that you would be 
better off without it? 

“But in writing your constitution 
let me invite attention to the won- 
derful virtues of the negative! Ac- 
centuate the negative! Let your 
document be studded with things 
the government is forever forbidden 
to do. No conscript armies ... no 
interference however slight with 
freedom of press, or speech, or 
travel, or assembly, or of religion, 
or of instruction, or communica- 
tion, or occupation ... no involun- 
tary taxation. Comrades, if you 
were to spend five years in a study 
of history while thinking of more 



and more things that your govern- 
ment should pro-mise never to do 
and then let your constitution be 
nothing but those negatives, I would 
not fear the outcome. 

“What I fear most are affirma- 
tive actions of sober and well-in- 
tentioned men, granting to govern- 
ment powers to do something that 
appears to need doing. Please re- 
member always that the Lunar 
Authority was created for the nob- 
lest of purposes by just such sober 
and well-intentioned men, all pop- 
ularly elected. And with that thought 
I leave you to your labors. Thank 
you.” 

“Gospodin President! Question of 
information! You said ‘no involun- 
tary taxation’ — then how do you 
expect us to pay for things? Tan- 
staafl!” 

“Goodness me, sir, that’s your 
problem. I can think of several 
ways. Voluntary contributions just 
as churches support themselves . 
government-sponsored lotteries to 
which no one need subscribe . 
or perhaps you Congressmen should 
dig down into your own pouches 
and pay for whatever is needed; 
that would be one way to keep 
government down in size to its in- 
dispensable functions whatever they 
may be. If indeed there are any. I 
would be satisfied to have the 
Golden Rule be the only law; I 
see no need for any other, nor for 
any method of enforcing it. But if 
you really believe that your neigh- 
bors must have laws for their own 
good, why shouldn’t you pay for it? 
Comrades, I beg you — do not re- 
sort to compulsory taxation. There

is no worse tyranny than to force 
a man to pay for w«hat he does 
not want merely because you think 
it would be good for him.V 

P rof bowed and left, Stu and I 
followed him. Once in an other- 
wise empty capsule I tackled him. 
“Prof, I liked much that you said 
. but about taxation aren’t you 
talking one thing and doing an- 
other? Who do you think is going 
to pay for aH this spending we’re 
doing?” 

He was silent long moments, then 
said, “Manuel, my only ambition 
is to reach the day when I can 
stop pretending to 1^ a chief exe- 
cutive.” 

“Is no answer!” 

“You have put your finger on the 
dilemma of all government — and 
the reason I am an anarchist. The 
power to tax, once conceded, has 
no limits; it continues until it des- 
troys. I was not joking when I told 
them to dig into their own pouches. 
It may not be possible to do away 
with government — sometimes I 
think that government is an ines- 
capable disease of human beings. 
But it may be possible to keep it 
small and starved and inoffensive. 
And can you think of a better way 
than by requiring the governors 
themselves to pay the costs of their 
anti-social hobby?” 

“Still doesn’t* say how to pay for 
what we are doing now.” 

“ ‘How,’ Manuel? You know how 
we are doing it. We‘re stealing 
it. I’m neither proud of it nor 
ashamed; it’s the means we have. 
If they ever catch on, they may 



eliminate us — and that I am pre- 
pared to face. At least, in stealing, 
we have not created the villainous 
precedent of taxation.” 

“Prof, I hate to say this — ” 
“Then why say it?” 

“Because, damn it. I’m in it as 
deeply as you are . and want 
to see that money paid back! Hate 
to say it but what you just said 
sounds like hypocrisy.” 

He chuckled. “Dear Manuel! Has 
it taken you all these years to de- 
cide that I am a hypocrite?” 

“Then you admit it?” 

“No. But if it makes you feel 
better to think that I am one, you 
are welcome to use me as your 
scapegoat. But I am not a hypocrite 
to myself because I was aware the 
day we declared the Revolution that 
we would need much money and 
would have to steal it. It did not 
trouble me because I considered it 
better than food riots six years 
hence, cannibalism in eight. I made 
my choice and have no regrets.” 

I shut up, silenced but not satis- 
fied. Stu said, “Professor, I’m 
glad to hear that you are anxious 
to stop being President.” 

“So? You share our comrade’s 
misgivings?” 

“Only in part. Having been born 
to wealth, stealing doesn’t fret me 
as much as it does him. No, but 
now that Congress has taken up 
the matter of a constitution I in- 
tend to find time to attend sessions. 
I plan to nominate you for King.” 
Prof looked shocked. “Sir, if 
nominated, I shall repudiate it. If 
elected, I shall abdicate.”

“Don’t be in a hurry. It might 
be the only way to get the sort of 
constitution you want. And that I 
want, too, with about your own 
mild lack of enthusiasm. You could 
be proclaimed King and the people 
would take you. We Loonies aren’t 
wedded to a republic. They’d love 
the idea — ritual and robes and a 
court and all that.” 

.“No!” 

“Ja da\ When the time comes, 
you won’t be able to refuse. Be- 
cause we need a king and there 
isn’t another candidate who would 
be accepted. Bernardo the First, 
King of Luna and Emperor of the 
Surrounding Spaces.” 

“Stuart, I must ask you to stop. 
I’m becoming quite ill.” 

“You’ll get used to it. I’m a 
royalist because I’m a democrat. I 
shan’t let your reluctance thwart 
the idea any more than you let 
stealing stop you.” 

I said, “Hold it, Stu. You say 
you’re a royalist because you’re a 
democrat?” 

“Of course. A king is the people’s 
only protection against tyranny . 
especially against the worst tyrants, 
themselves. Prof will be ideal for 
the job . because he does not 
want the job. His only shortcoming 
is that hef is a bachelor with no

hands. “Oh, Bogr 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



M onday 12 October 2076 about 
nineteen hundred I was head- 
ed home after a hard day of non- 
sense in our offices in Raffles. 
Delegation of grain farmers wanted 
to see Prof and I had been called 
because he was in Hong Kong- Luna. 

Was rude to them. Had been 
two months of embargo and. F.N. 
had never done us favor of being 
sufficiently narsty. Mostly they had 
ignored us, made no reply to our 
claims. I suppose to do so would 
have been to recognize us. Stu and 
Sheenie and Prof had been hard 
put to slant news from Earthside 
to keep up a warlike spirit. 

At first everybody kept his p-suit 
handy. They wore them, helmets 
under arms, going to and from 
work in corridors. But that slacked 
off as days went by and did not 
seem to be any danger. P-suit is 
nuisance when you don’t need it, 
so bulky. Presently taprooms be- 
gan to display signs: “No P-suits 
Inside.” If a Loonie can’t stop for 
half a liter on way home because 
of p-suit, he’ll leave it home or at 
station or wherever he needs it 
most. 

My word, had neglected matter 
myself that day — got this call to 
go back to office and was halfway 
there before I remembered. 

Had just reached easement lock 
thirteen when I heard and felt a 
sound that scares a Loonie more 
than anything else — a Chuffl in 
distance followed by a draft. Was 
into lock almost without undogging, 
then balanced pressures and through, 

157 




dogged it behind me and ran tor 
our home lock — through it and 
shouting: 

“P-suits, everybody! Get boys in 
from tunnels and close all airtight 
doors!” 

Mum and Milla were only adults 
in sight. Both looked startled, got 
busy without a word. I burst into 
workshop, grabbed p-suit. “Mike! 
Answer!” 

“I^m here, Man,” he said calm- 

•y* 

“Heard explosive pressure drop. 
What’s situation?” 

“That’s level three, L-City. Rup- 
ture at Tube Station West, now 
partly controlled. Six ships landed,

‘W/ifl/?” 

“Let me finish, Man. Six trans-

“Nyet — Yes! Dar

automatic. ‘T” made him repeat 
back. 

“Okay,” I told Mike. “Drill gun 
crews?” 

“Your voice again. Manned, and 
then sent back to ready rooms. That 
command sihip won’t reach apose- 
lenion for three hours four point

than five hours.” 

“He may maneuver. Or launch

“Slow down, Man. Even a missile

full bright lunar up there now. How 
much do you want the men to 
take? Unnecessarfly.” 

“Uh . sorry. Better let me 
talk to Greg.” 

“Play back.” Heard “my” voice 
talking to my co-husband at Mare 
Undarum; “I” sounded tense but 
calm. Mike had given him situation, 
had told him to prepare Operation 

IF 




Little David's Sling, keep it on 
stand-by for full automatic. “I** had 
assured him that master computer 
would keep standby computer pro- 
grammed, and shift would be made 
automatically if communication was 
broken. “I” also told him that he 
must take command and use own 
judgment if communication was lost 
and not restored after four hours 
— listen to Earthside radio and 
make up own mind. 

Greg had taken it quietly, re- 
peated his orders, then had said, 
“Mannie, tell family I love them.” 



Mike had done me proud; he had 
answered for me with just right em- 
barrassed choke, “ril do that, Greg 
— and look, Greg, I love you, too. 
You know that, don’t you?” 

“I know it, Mannie . and 
I’m going to say a special prayer 
for you.” 

“Thanks, Greg.” 

“‘Bye, Mannie. Go- do what you 
must.” 

So I went and did what I had to 
do. We weren’t ready for it. But 
would never be readier; the battle 
for Luna had been joined

Dear Editor; 

As a science-fiction fan of 
many years and an avid reader of 
your excellent magazine for just as 
long, I thouglit I would check with 
you on a striking fact regarding 
the recent power failure. 

Fritz Leiber wrote a story a few 
years ago called The Man Who 
Made Friends with Electricity. A 
reading of this story may strike you 
with the same chill that hit me. Is 
Mr. Leiber available for comment? 
And should we have an ambassador 
to electrons? — George Ann Mon- 
ahan, 5 Wright Avenue, Wakefield, 
Rhode Island. 

♦ ♦ ♦ 

Dear Editor; 

D. Bruce Berry brings up an in- 
teresting idea about getting read- 
ers to write or to read letter col- 
umns. Why not dwell on it more? 
There was a time when readers* 
columns were much more vital to a 
magazine and some readers misused 
them and some editors decided to 
discourage such departments for that 
or other reasons. They are indica- 
tive of a lively enthusiasm, and live- 
ly enthusiasm is contagious. Part of 
the lack of success is the squeezed 
layout for letters. Why not start 
them inside the front cover in large 



type with a good heading and then 
continue them in back with smaller 
type? A lively readers’ department 
generates lively letters. And it has 
to be two-way. People who ask ques- 
tions like to be answered . even 
if they get told it is none of their 
business. 

Why not try this expanded layout 
to the lead story? Why not double 
your budget for the first art work 
in the magazine even if it isn’t the 
best story? After the cover it is the 
one that sells more magazines than 
anything else. Why not use a double 
spread and larger type for two or 
four pages so that the reader is eas- 
ily hooked into the story before he 
is hardly aware of H? And continue 
a double spread art work for a few 
more pages, then you can revert to 
solid fine print after the reader is 
captured. This is like a gift store 
with sidewalks and display cases, 
and open doors and counters so ar- 
ranged that you are off the street 
and in the middle of the merchan- 
dise before you are aware of it. 

I think the cover is terribly im- 
portant. It should stand out on the 
newsstand, catch the eye, arouse the 
curiosity and appeal, not repel. Ev- 
eryone knows good philosophy about 
cover display, but how the devil do 



160 




jr^tt put it into practice? 1, for one, 
tirink that nice ci^r-shap^ space- 
•hips agrainst a nice set of stars is 
Tery deadening and can only appeal 
to those of us who grew up with 
•cience fiction. I think color, action, 
a hint of “muchness* or “more- 
and-more-for-your-time” (not for 
your money -money is cheap) and a 
bit of mystery are important. Don't 
spell anything out to a gnat’s eye- 
brow on the cover. Why read it if 
you do? Space ships in space usual- 
ly spell out everything. 

A promise of a new rewarding 
experience should go with the cover. 
It should not be tight and squeezed 
in, but should suggest that it goes 
beyond the boundaries of the cover 
in all directions. Particularly, there 
should be come color or movement 
toward the “turning edge of the 
magazine” to make someone want 
to open it and look. They had better 
find something provocative inside 
right away! And my idea of several 
double spreads and illustrations in 
the first few pages seems sound and 
important. You aren’t Life mag- 
azine, but you can use a little of 
their merchandising. 

We could convince education 
people that science fiction is more 
interesting than the cheaper spread 
on TV with a massive advertising 
campaign sponsored by a govern- 
ment gran^t or a sick millionaire. 
What is wrong with personal sales- 
manship? It isn’t really the duty of 
a reader to sell the magazine to a 
prospective reader, but some fans 
have done so for years. Some oth- 
ers have personalities that would 
not make for good salesmanship. 
Leave a good issue in a public place. 
Not a bus station — they get swept 
up. Or hand the best story to some- 
one who can appreciate it. Start a 



slow sales pitch, starting with what 
the prospect thinks he knows and 
believes. Avoid in-group jargon. The 
biggest stumbling block to science 
fiction is the same as the stumbling 
block to race relations — ^man's in- 
stinctive fear of the unfamiliar. 
Sneak, sneak, sneak and smile, 
smile and flatter, flatter. How wise 
you are to read this I! — only don’t 
overdo it. 

I suspect that science-fiction fans 
are becoming passive innocent by- 
standers though, who, like 38 per- 
sons in New York, wouldn't even 
call the police to prevent a murder. 
You wouldn't raise your voice to 
help science fiction or to promote 
space travel— or would you? Or can 
I make any of you mad? — Rosco 
Wright, Art Department, Western 
Montana College, Dillon, Montana.

Dear Editor: 

I was somewhat startled by D. 
Bruce Berry's comments that If 
and Worlds of Tomorrow are basic- 
ally entertainment magazines. 

They got me to thinking about 
v/hat science fiction has become. 

Magazine sf started off with a 
bang. BE MS, beauties and super- 
atomic-destructo devices literally 
littered the scene. Magazine sf was 
basically entertainment in those 
days, presenting novel ideas about 
novel inventions to its readership. 

But in time, sf mellowed, became 
more subtle. The stories contained 
real people, not just the evilly evil 
badguy, who is inevitably subdued 
by the goody goody goodguy. 

“Message stories” appeared more 
frequently — the “how mankind 
should be saved” type. 

Now we seem to be bogging 
down. Sf no longer has a bottom- 
less well of novel inventions suf- 
ficiently exciting to produce an ac- 
tual “sense of wonder” so prevalent 
in the beginning. With the result 
that we are straining what “inven- 
tions” we have to the Hmit. 

What I'm trying to say is that 
instead of producing entirely dif- 



ferent levels of ideas and innova- 
tions, we are falling back on the 
type of fiction that was present in 
Gemsback's day. 

Sf is a unique field. Mainstream 
fiction can only comment on how 
man, his mental makeup and phy- 
chology, is today. But sf can pre- 
sent a far-flung view of his make- 
up in the future. 

Our purpose is not mere enter- 
tainment. We already have enough 
of that: witness the witless boob 
tube, or the incessant “sounds” 
coming from the radio. This is our 
entertainment. Why be like every- 
one else and bring yourself down to 
this level? Take a look at Gaug- 
han's cover on ttie Oct. '65 issue of 
//. Is this representative of the 
full potential of sf? 

Let's put some meat into science 
fiction. Retief and Gree stories are 
okay, to a certain extent. But let's 
not make it our goal in publishing. 

In closing, I was wondering if 
there was any way to assure the 
safe arrival of subscription copies? 
Those of us who like copies in good 
condition find scrunched spines and 
covers unbecoming to the magazine. 
And besides, it's also harder to 
read. — Dan Barnett, 7542 Skyway, 
Paradise, Calif., 95969. 

# Actually our goal in publishing 
is pretty simple: To print stories 
we enjoy, hoping that enough oth- 
ers will also enjoy them to keep us 
in business. So beautifully simple 
in theory — but, ah! how complex in 
putting it into effect! 

That's it for another month. Next

IN CASH 

“Your $1,200.00 check arrived this morning by Special 
Delivery. Thanks ever so much for your telephone call and 
prompt payment. It still doesn't seem possible. It's been z 
great thrill." 

That's the way Emory Mead of Albany, N. Y., just one of 
our many big winners, reacted to receiving his cash prize. 
Dozens of men and women of all ages have cashed in as 
members of our exciting PUZZLE LOVERS CLUB. 

Our Club winners got their cash awards for solving 
puzzles in their leisure time. Our Club also has awarded 
huge prizes for many other kinds of contests. 



PRIZES! 

We've awarded cash in hundred-and-thousand-dollar units 
to retirees, sewing women, farmers, salesmen, war vet- 
erans, office workers, clerks, secretaries — people who 
never before dreamed of having the kind of money that 
movie stars make. 

This announcement is an invitation to you, as a reader 
of this publication, to find out for yourself if you have the 
talent to win up to $70,000.00 in cash. If you are over 18 
and like to play word games of any kind, the information 
below may lead you to thousands of dollars in extra cash 
that you may use as you wish. 




Mrs. H. C. Despain, Hous- 
ton, Tex., won $1,000.00 
in cash in one month.

Cincinnati, won $500.00 
on just one puzzie.

FREE BOOK tells how these people— and 
hundreds of others— got started in this Big 
Money business. Send for your copy now. 



Let me give you the same 
start I gave these men! 



In one way, the big earnings rejjorted 
here might be called exceptional. In 
another way, there is nothing excep- 
tional about them. That’s because any 
man who will follow instructions and is 
willing to work at his own Duraclean 
business should be able to do as well 
under similar conditions. 

Each of the men quoted here had tal- 
ents and abilities different from those of 
alb the rest. But each had one thing in 
common — a desire to win personal inde- 
pendence in a business of his own. And 
each man took hve identical steps to 
reach his goal. 

1. Each one read an announcement such 
as you are reading now. 2. He wrote 
for complete information. 3. He read the 
literature we sent him. 4. He gained 
new confidence in himself and the belief 
that he could suc<?eed with Duraclean. 
5. He accepted our offer to help him get 
started. Later, he wrote to tell us about 
his success. 

In eabh case, remember, the first step 
was to write to Duraclean for informa- 
tion. If you would like to own a business 
of your own, why don’t you do as these 
men did — right now. 

When I hear from you, I will send you 
facts about the Duraclean Franchise 
that will open your eyes. You will see 
why a Franchise business such as ours 
makes success for the individual the rule 
rather than the exception. 



The Duraclean home service business 
has been tried and tested. The. market 
for Duraclean Service is tremendous — 
and growing. The methods that lead to 
success have been clearly charted. When 
an ambitious man follows these meth- 
ods, success is the logical result. 

Some Franchise businesses require 
investments as high as $50,000. With 
ours, you can get started for a few hun- 
dred dollars and we hnance the balance. 
Monthly payments are so small that the 
profits on less than one day’s service can 
cover your payment for the entire 
month. Even with this small investment 
and operating as a one man business, 
your potential is $250.00 a week net 
profit. With two men working for you 
35 hours a week, you should gross a 
profit of $420.00. Allowing 20% for 
advertising and incidentals, the net 
would amount to $336.00. 

The most important part of Duraclean 
home service is cleaning rugs,* carpets 
and upholstered furniture by a revolu- 
tionary modern process known as the 
“Absorption Method.’’ You do the 
work right in the customer’s premises. 
No harsh scrubbing with motor-driven 
brushes. No soaking. Instead, an aer- 
ated foam loosens the dirt and holds it 
in suspension until removed. A test con- 
ducted by an impartial laboratory 
showed that the modern Absorption 
Method removed twice as much dirt as 



was removed by old fashioned machine 
scrubbing. 

If you are tired of working for others 
or of jumping from one proposition to 
another — if you have a real yearning 
for independence in a business of your 
own — then send for “The Duraclean 
Route to Success.” There is no obliga- 
tion — no charge. No salesmen will call 
to high pressure you. Send for the book 
now. Read it. Then if you want to take 
the next step toward independence, you 
can write to me and let me give you the 
same help I’ve given so many other suc- 
cessful men.
