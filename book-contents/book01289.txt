NOSTRADAMUS 

CONCLUDED 



T he main conclusion to be con- 
cluded from our little game (can 
you predict what the lead story in 
the paper will be 90 days from 
now?) is that people read sf, or at 
least people who read //, will not 
limit themselves. They wouldn’t fol- 
low format. (So and so has been 
happening. Such and such has hap- 
pened. Therefore this and that will 
happen in 90 days.) They wouldn’t 
predict for three months. 

But boy, they go high and far out! 
A surprising number used the safe 
“1 predict that things will happen 
as usual” kind of prognostication, 
and used it amusingly, like L. J. 
Fremstad of El Paso, who said, “The 
Democrats will start a piece of leg- 
islation, the Republicans will call it 
Socialism, the Democrats will call it 
Liberalism, the American public will 
put up with it.” Rosalyn Woldin, of 
Brooklyn, N. Y v . came up with a 
terrifying clutch of disasters, not one 
of which would fall within the 90- 
day limit, but which included a gen- 
eration of muscle-bound youth due 
to the success of the Kennedy physi- 
cal-fitness program and the failure 
of- other kinds of education; a de- 
terioration in public confidence in 
doctors because of Medicare argu- 
ments and the Canadian strike, plus 
a rise in quackery; religious protests 
against space exploration to the point 

4 



of dangerous fanaticism; monetary 
inflation to the point of economic 
ruin, and union recognition of pur- 
chasing power as a more important 
consideration than n\ore dollars; a 
worsening of interracial strife, then 
its ultimate solution by boycott; and 
finally, scandalous behavior by movie 
people will abate, then continue as 
before. 

One respondent made a prediction 
which I shall not repeat, though I 
shall acknowledge it if and when it 
turns out to be true. It has to do 
with a course of action to be taken 
by a public figure. If we modestly 
assume that this personage probably 
never would see the copy of If with 
the prediction and, further, would 
probably do nothing of the kind, 
the possibility still remains that if 
the prediction is right, the predic- 
tion itself might have been a mo- 
tivating factor. I wouldn’t want that 
on your conscience or mine. 

Space prohibits a listing of all con- 
tributors. Our warm thanks to all 
participants Mavbe we’ll try this 
again some time, when 1 am better 
able to phrase the limitations of the 
problem. A prize one-year subscrip- 
tion to IF goes to Mrs. Angelo Cas- 
tagna of Thompson ville, Conn., she 
of the “man-powered space ship”, 
with our thanks and our blessings.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

THE 

FIVE HELLS 
OF 

ORION 



BY FREDERICK POHL 



Illustrated by Schelling 



Out In the great gas cloud 
of the Orion Nebula McCray 
found an ally — and a fool 



H is name was Herrell McCray 
and he was scared. 

As best he could tell, he was in 
a sort of room no bigger than a pris- 
on cell. Perhaps it was a prison cell. 
Whatever it was, he had no business 
in it; for five minutes before he had 
been spaceborne, on the Long Jump 
from Earth to the thriving colonies 
circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray 
was ship’s navigator, plotting course 
corrections — not that there were any, 
ever; but the reason there were none 
was that, the check-sightings were 
made every hour of the long flight. 
He had read off the azimuth angles 
from the computer sights, automatic- 
ally locked on their beacon stars, 
and found them correct; then out 
of long habit confirmed the locking 
mechanism visually. It was only a 
personal quaintness; he had done 
it a thousand times. And while he 
was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel and 
Saiph ... it happened. 



The room was totally dark, and it 
seemed to be furnished with a col- 
lection of hard, sharp, sticky and 
knobby objects of various shapes and 
a number of inconvenient sizes. Mc- 
Cray tripped over something that 
rocked under his feet and fell against 
something that clattered hollowly. 
He picked himself up, braced against 
somtthing that smelled dangerously 
of halogen compounds, and scratch- 
ed his shoulder, right through his 
space-tunic, against something that 
vibrated as he touched it. 

McCray had no idea where he 
was, and no way to find out. 

Not only was he in darkness, but 
in utter silence as well. No. Not 
quite utter silence. 

Somewhere, just at the threshold 
of his senses, there was something 
like a voice. He could not quite hear 
it, but it was there. He sat as still as 
he could, listening; it remained elu- 
sive. 



7 




Probably it was only an illusion. 

But the room itself was hard fact. 
McCray swore violently and out 
loud. 

It was crazy and impossible. 
There simply was no way for him to 
get from a warm, bright navigator’s 
cubicle on Starship Jodrell Bank to 
this damned, dark, dismal hole of 
a place where everything was out 
to hurt him and nothing explained 
what was going on. He cried aloud 
in exasperation: “If 1 could only 
seer 

He tripped and fell against some- 
thing that was soft, slimy and, like 
baker’s dough, not at all resilient. 

A flickering halo of pinkish light 
appeared. He sat up, startled. He 
was looking at something that re- 
sembled a suit of medieval armor. 

I t. was, he saw in a moment, not 
armor but a spacesuit. But what 
was the light? And what were these 
other things in the room? 

Wherever he looked, the light 
danced along with his eyes It was 
like having tunnel vision or wearing 
blinders. He could see what he was 
looking at, but he could see nothing 
else. And the things he could see 
made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he 
knew that he could construct a logi- 
cal explanation for that with no trou- 
ble — maybe a subspace meteorite 
striking the Jodrell Bank , an explo- 
sion. himself knocked out, brought 
here in a -suit . well, it was an 
explanation with more holes than 
fabric, like a fisherman’s net, but at 
least it was rational. 

How to explain a set of Gibbon’s 
Decline and FaU of the Roman Em- 
pire? A space-ax? Or the old-fash- 
ioned child’s rocking-chair, the 
chemistry set— or, most of all, the 

8 



scrap of gaily printed fabric that, 
when he picked it up, turned out to 
be a girl’s scanty bathing suit? It 
was slightly reassuring, McCray 
thought, to find that most of the 
objects were more or less familiar. 
Even the child’s chair — why, he’d 
had one more or less like that him- 
self, long before he was old enough 
to go to school. But what were they 
doing here? 

Not everything he saw was famil- 
iar. The walls of the room itself 
were strange. They were not metal 
or plaster or knotty pine; they were 
not papered, painted or overlaid with 
stucco. They seemed to be made of 
some sort of hard organic com- 
pound, perhaps a sort of plastic or 
processed cellulose. It was hard to 
tell colors in the pinkish light. But 
they seemed to have none. They 
were “neutral” — the color of aged 
driftwood or unbleached cloth. 

Three of the walls were that way, 
and the floor and ceiling. The fourth 
wall was something else. Areas in it 
had the appearance of gratings; from 
them issued the pungent, distasteful 
halogen odor. They might be ven- 
tilators, he thought; but if so the 
air they brought in was worse than 
what he already had. 

McCray was beginning to feel 
more confident. It was astonishing 
how a little light made an impossible 
situation bearable, how quickly his 
courage flowed back when he could 
see again. 

He stood still, thinking. Item, a 
short time ago — subjectively it seem- 
ed to be minutes — he had been 
aboard the Jodrell Bank with noth- 
ing more on his mind than complet- 
ing his check-sighting and meeting 
one of the female passengers for 
coffee. Item, apart from being sha- 




ken up and — he admitted it — scared 
damn near witless, he did not seem 
to be hurt. Item, wherever he was 
now, it became, not so much what 
had happened to him, but what had 
happened to the ship? 

He allowed that thought to seep 
into his mind. Suppose there had 
been an accident to the Jodrell Bank . 

He could, of course, be dead. All 
this could be the fantasies of a cool- 
ing brain. 

McCray grinned into the pink-lit 
darkness. The thought had somehow 
refreshed him, like icewater between 
rounds, and with a clearing head he 
remembered what a spacesuit was 
good for. 

It held a radio. 

He pressed the unsealing tabs, 
slipped his hand into the vacant chest 
of the suit and pulled out the hand 
mike. “This is Herrell McCray,” he 
said, “calling the Jodrell Bank” 

No response. He frowned. “This 
is Herrell McCray, calling Jodrell 
Bank . 

“Herrell McCray, calling anybody, 
come in, please.” 

But there was no answer. 

Thoughtfully he replaced the mic- 
rophone. This was ultrawave radio, 
something more than a million times 
faster than light, with a range meas- 
ured, at least, in hundreds of light- 
years. If there was no answer, he was 
a good long way from anywhere. 

Ot course, the thing might not be 
operating. • 

He reached for the microphone 
again — 

He cried aloud. 

The pinkish lights went out. He 
was in the dark again, worse dark 
than before. 

For before the light had gone, Mc- 
Cray had seen what had escaped his 

10 



eyes before. The suit and the micro- 
phone were clear enough in the pink- 
ish glimmer; but the hand — his own 
hand, cupped to hold the microphone 
— he had not seen at all. Nor his 
arm. Nor, in one fleeting moment 
of study, his chest. 

McCray could not see any part of 
his own body at all. 

II 

omeone else could. 

Someone was watching Herrell 
McCray, with the clinical fascination 
of a biochemist observing the wig- 
glings of paramecia in a new anti- 
biotic — and with the prayerful emo- 
tions of a starving, shipwrecked, 
sailor, watching the inward bobbing 
drift of a wave-born cask that may 
contain food. 

Suppose you call him “Hatcher” 
(and suppose you call it a “him.”) 
Hatcher was not exactly male, be* 
cause his race had no true males; 
but it did have females and he was. 
certainly not that. Hatcher did not 
in any way look like a human being, 
but they had features in common. 

If Hatcher and McCray had some- 
how managed to strike up an ac- 
quaintance, they might have got 
along very well. Hatcher, like Mc- 
Cray. was an adventurous soul, 
young, able, well-learned in the tech- 
nical sciences of his culture. Both 
enjoyed games — McCray baseball, 
pokeT and three-dimensional chess; 
Hatcher a number of sports which 
defy human description. Both held 
positions of some importance — con- 
sidering their ages — in the affairs* 
of their respective worlds. 

Physically they were nothing alike. 
Hatcher was a three- foot, hard- 
shelled sphere of jelly. He had 
“arms” and “legs,” but they were 




not organically attached to “him- 
self.” They were snakelike things 
which obeyed the orders of his 
brain as well as your mind can make 
your toes curl; but they did not 
touch him directly. Indeed, they 
worked as well a yard or a quar- 
ter-mile away as they did when, rare- 
ly, they rested in the crevices they 
had been formed from in his “skin.” 
At greater distances they worked less 
well, for reasons irrelevant to the 
Law of Inverse Squares. 

Hatcher’s principal task at this 
moment was to run the “probe team” 
which had McCray under observa- 
tion, and he was more than a little 
excited. His members, disposed about 
the room where he had sent them on 
various errands, quivered and shook 
a little; yet they were the calmest 
limbs in the room; the members of 
the other team workers were in a 
state of violent commotion. 

The probe team had had a shock. 

“Paranormal powers,” muttered 
Hatcher's second in command, and 
the others mumbled agreement. 
Hatcher ordered silence, studying the 
specimen from Earth. 

After a long moment he turned 
his senses from the Earthman. “In- 
credible — but it's true enough,” he 
said. “I’d better report. Watch him,” 
he added, but that was surely unne- 
cessary. Their job was to watch Mc- 
Cray, and they would do their job; 
and even more, not one of them 
could have looked away to save his 
life from the spectacle of a creature 
as odd and, from their point of view, 
hideously alien as Herrell McCray. 

H atcher hurried through the halls 
of the great buried structure in 
which he worked, toward the place 
where the supervising council of all 



probes would be in permanent ses- 
sion. They admitted him at once. 

Hatcher identified himself and 
gave a quick, concise report: 

“The subject recovered conscious- 
ness a short time ago and began to 
inspect his enclosure. His method of 
doing so was to put his own mem- 
bers in physical contact with the 
various objects in the enclosure. Aft- 
er observing him do this for a time 
we concluded he might be unable to 
see and so we illuminated his field 
of vision for him. 

“This appeared to work well for 
a time. He seemed relatively undis- 
turbed. However, he then reverted 
to physical-contact, manipulating 
certain appurtenances of an arti- 
ficial skin we had provided for him. 

“He then began to vibrate the at- 
mosphere by means of resonating 
organs in his breathing passage. 

“Simultaneously, the object he 
was holding, attached to the artificial 
skin, was discovered to be genera- 
ting paranormal forces.” 

The supervising council rocked 
with excitement. “You're sure?” de- 
manded one of the councilmen. 

“Yes, sir. The staff is preparing 
a technical description of the forces 
now, but I can say that they are 
electromagnetic vibrations modula- 
ting a carrier wave of very high 
speed, and in turn modulated by the 
vibrations of the atmosphere caused 
by the subject’s own breathing.” 
“Fantastic,” breathed the coun- 
cillor, in a tone of dawning hope. 
“How about communicating with 
him, Hatcher? Any progress?” 

“Well . not much, sir. He sud- 
denly panicked We don’t know why; 
but we thought we’d better pull 
back and let him recover for a 
while.” 



11 




The council conferred among it- 
self for a moment, Hatcher waiting. 
It was not really a waste of time 
for him; with the organs he had left 
in the probe-team room, he was in 
fairly close touch with what was 
going on — knew that McCray was 
once again fumbling among the ob- 
jects in the dark, knew that the 
team-members had tried illumina- 
ting the room for him briefly and 
again produced the rising panic. 

Still, Hatcher fretted. He wanted 
to get back. 

“Stop fidgeting,” commanded the 
council leader abruptly. “Hatcher, 
you are to establish communication 
at once.” 

"But, sir ... ” Hatcher swung 
closer, his thick skin quivering 
slightly; he would have gestured if 
he had brought members with him 
to gesture with. “We’ve done every- 
thing we dare. We’ve made the place 
homey for him — ” actually, what 
he said was more like, we've warmed 
the biophysical nuances of his en- 
closure — “and tried to guess his 
needs; and we’re frightening him half 
to death. We can't go faster. This 
creature is in no way similar to us, 
you know. He relies on paranormal 
forces — heat, light, kinetic energy — 
for his life. His chemistry is not 
ours, his processes of thought are 
not ours, his entire organism is closer 
to the inanimate rocks of a sea- 
bottom than to ourselves.” 

“Understood, Hatcher. In your 
first report you stated these creatures 
were intelligent.” 

“Yes, sir. But not in our way.” 
“But in a way, and you must learn 
that way. I know.” One lobster-claw 
shaped member drifted close to the 
councillor’s body and raised itself 
in an admonitory gesture. “You want 

12 



time. But we don’t have time, Hatch- 
er. Yours is not the only probe team 
working. The Central Masses team 
has just turned in a most alarming 
report.” 

“Have they secured a subject?” 
Hatcher demanded jealously. 

The councillor paused. “Worse 
than that, Hatcher. I am afraid their 
subjects have secured one of them. 
One of them is missing.” 

There was a moment’s silence. 
Frozen, Hatcher could only wait. 
The council room was' like a tab- 
leau in a museum until the coun- 
cillor spoke again, each council 
member poised over his locus-point, 
his members drifting about him. 

Finally the councillor said, “I 
speak for all of us, I think. If the Old 
Ones have seized one of our probers 
our time margin is considerably nar- 
rowed. Indeed, we may not have any 
time at all. You must do everything 
you can to establish communication 
with your subject.” 

“But the danger to the speci- 
men — ” Hatcher protested auto- 
matically. 

“ — is no greater,” said the coun- 
cillor, “than the danger to every 
one of us if we do not find allies 
now." 

H atcher returned to his labora- 
tory gloomily. 

It was just like the council to 
put the screws on; they had a reputa- 
tion for demanding results at any 
cost — even at the cost of destroying 
the only thing you had that would 
make results possible. 

Hatcher did not like the idea of 
endangering the Earthman. It can- 
not be said that he was emotionally 
involved; it was not pity or sym- 
pathy that caused him to regret the 




dangers in moving too fast toward 
communication. Not even Hatcher 
had quite got over the revolting 
physical differences between the 
Earthman and his own people. But 
Hatcher did not want him destroyed. 
It had been difficult enough getting 
him here. 

Hatcher checked through the 
members that he had left with the 
rest of his team and discovered that 
here were no immediate emergen- 
cies, so he took time to eat. In 
Hatcher’s race this was accomplished 
in ways not entirely pleasant to 
Earthmen. A slit in the lower hem- 
isphere of his body opened, like a 
purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid 
fluid which Hatcher caught and 
poured into a disposal trough at the 
side of the eating room. He then 
stuffed the slit with pulpy vegeta- 
tion the texture of kelp; it closed, 
and his body was supplied with 
nourishment for another day. 

He returned quickly to the room. 

His second in command was busy, 
but one of the other team workers 
reported — nothing new — and asked 
Hatcher’s appearance before the 
council. Hatcher passed the ques- 
tion off. He considered telling his 
staff about the disappearance of the 
Central Masses team member, but 
decided against it. He had not been 
told it was secret. On the other hand, 
he had not been told it was not. 
Something of this importance was 
not lightly to be gossiped about. For 
endless generations the threat of the 
Old Ones had hung over his race, 
those queer, almost mythical be- 
ings from the Central Masses of the 
galaxy. One brush with them, in 
ages past, had almost destroyed 
Hatcher’s people. Only by running 
and hiding, bearing one of their 



planets with them and abandoning 
it — with its population — as a decoy, 
had they arrived at all. 

Now they had detected mapping 
parties of the Old Ones dangerously 
near the spiral arm of the galaxy 
in which their planet was located, 
they had begun the Probe Teams to 
find some way of combatingihem, or 
of fleeing again. 

But it seemed that the Probe 
Teams themselves might be betray- 
ing their existence to their enemies — 

“Hatcher!” 

The call was urgent; he hurried 
to see what it was about. It was his 
second in command, very excited. 
“What is it?” Hatcher demanded. 

“Wait ...” 

Hatcher was patient; he knew his 
assistant well. Obviously something 
was about to happen. He took the 
moment to call his members back 
to him for feeding; they dodged 
back to their niches on his skin, 
fitted themselves into their vestigial 
slots, poured back their wastes ii)to 
his own circulation and ingested 
what they needed from the meal 
he had just taken . “Now!” cried 
the assistant. “Look!” 

At what passed among Hatcher’s 
people for a viewing console an im- 
age was forming. Actually it was the 
assistant himself who formed it, not 
a cathode trace or projected shadow; 
but it showed what it was meant 
to show. 

Hatcher was startled. “Another 
one! And — is it a different species? 
Or merely a different sex?” 

“Study the probe for yourself,” 
the assistant invited. 

Hatcher studied him frostily; his 
patience was not, after all, endless. 
“No matter,” he said at last. “Bring 
the other one in.” 



13 




And then, in a completely differ- 
ent mood, “We may need him badly. 
We may be in the process of killing 
our first one now.” 

“Killing him, Hatcher?” 

Hatcher rose and shook himself, 
his mindless members floating away 
like puppies dislodged from suck. 
“Council’s orders,” he said. “We’ve 
got to go into Stage Two of the 
project at once.” 

Ill 

B efore Stage Two began, or be- 
fore Herrell McCray realized 
it had begun, he had an inspiration. 

The dark was absolute, but he re- 
membered where the spacesuit had 
been and groped his way to it and, 
yes, it had what all spacesuits had 
to have. It had a light. He found the 
toggle that turned it on and pressed it. 

. Light. White, flaring, Earthly 
light, that showed everything — 
even himself. 

“God bless,” he said, almost be- 
side himself with joy. Whatever that 
pinkish, dancing halo had been, it 
had thrown him into a panic; now 
that he could see his own hand 
again, he could blame the weird ef- 
fects on some strange property of 
the light. 

At the moment he heard the click 
that \Vas the beginning of Stage Two. 

He switched otf the light and 
stood for a moment, listening. 

For a second he thought he heard 
the far-off Voice, quiet, calm and al- 
most hopeless, that he had sensed 
hours before; but then that was 
gone. Something else was gone. 
Some famt mechanical sound that 
had hardly registered at the time, 
but was not missing. And there was, 
perhaps, a nice new sound that had 

14 



not been there before; A very faint, 
an almost inaudible elfin hiss. 

McCray switched the light on and 
looked around. There seemed to be 
no change. 

And yet, surely, it was warmer 
in here. 

He could see no difference; but 
perhaps, he thought, he could smell 
one. The unpleasant halogen odor 
from the grating was surely stronger 
now. He stood there, perplexed. 

A tinny little voice from the hel- 
met of the space suit said sharply, 
amazement in its tone, “McCray, is 
that you? Where the devil are you 
calling from?” 

He forgot smell, sound and tem- 
perature and leaped for the suit. 
“This is Herrell McCray,” he cried. 
“I’m in a room of some sort, appar- 
ently on a planet of approximate 
Earth mass. I don’t know — ” 

“McCray!” cried the tiny voice 
in his ear. “Where are you? This is 
Jodrell Bank calling. Answer, 
please!” 

“I am answering, damn it,” he 
roared. “What took you so long?” 

“Herrell McCray,” droned the 
tiny voice in his ear, “Herrell Mc- 
Cray, Herrell McCray, this is Jodrell 
Bank responding to your message, 
acknowledge please. Herrell McCray, 
Herrell McCray . .” 

It kept on, and on. 

McCray took a deep breath and 
thought. Something was wrong. 
Either they didn’t hear him, which 
meant the radio wasn’t transmitting, 
or — no That was not it; they had 
heard him. because they were re- 
sponding. But it seemed to take 
them so long . 

Abruptly his face went white. 
Took them so long! He cast back in 
his mind, questing for a fact, unable 




to face its implications. When was 
it he called them? Two hours ago? 
Three? 

Did that mean — did it possibly 
mean — that there was a lag of an 
hour or two each way? Did it, for 
example, mean that at the speed of 
his suit’s pararadio, millions of times 
faster than light, it took hours to 
get a message to the ship and back? 

And if so . where in the name 
of heaven was he? 

H errell McCray was a navigator, 
which is to say, a man who has 
learned to trust the evidence of ma- 
thematics and instrument readings 
beyond the guesses of his “common 
sense.” When Jodrell Bank, hurtling 
faster than light in its voyage be- 
tween stars, made its regular posi- 
tion check, common sense was a liar. 
Light bore false witness. The line of 
sight was trustworthy directly for- 
ward and directly after — some- 
times not even then — and it took 
computers, sensing their data 
through instruments, to compre- 
hend a star bearing and convert 
three fixes into a position. 

If the evidence of his radio con- 
tradicted common sense, common 
Sense was wrong. Perhaps it was im- 
possible to believe what the radio’s 
message implied; but it was not ne- 
cessary to “believe,” only to act. 

McCray thumbed down the trans- 
mitter button and gave a concise re- 
port of his situation and his guesses. 
“I don’t know how I got here. I 
don’t know how long I’ve been gone, 
since I was unconscious for a time. 
However, if the transmission lag is 
a reliable indication — ” he swallow- 
ed and went on — “I’d estimate I 
am something more than five hun- 
dred light-years away from you at this 



moment. That’s all I have to say, 
except for one more word: Help.” 

He grinned sourly and released 
the button. The message was on its 
way, and it would be hours before 
he could have a reply. Therefore he 
had to consider what to do next. 

He mopped his brow. With the 
droning, repetitious call from the 
ship finally quiet, the room was quiet 
again. And warm. 

Very warm, he thought tardily; 
and more than that. The halogen 
stench was strong in his nostrils 
again. 

Hurriedly McCray scrambled into 
the suit. By the time he was sealed 
down he was coughing from the bot- 
tom of his lungs, deep, tearing rasps 
that • pained him, uncontrollable. 
Chlorine or fluorine, one of them 
was in the air he had been breathing. 
He could not guess where it had 
come from; but it was ripping his 
lungs out. 

He flushed the interior of the suit 
out with a reckless disregard for the 
wastage of his air reserve, holding 
his breath as much as he could, dar- 
ing only shallow gasps that made 
him retch and gag. After a long time 
he could breath, though his eyes 
were spilling tears. 

He could see the fumes in the 
room now. The heat was building 
up. 

Automatically — now that he had 
put it on and so started its serVo- 
circuits operating — the suit was 
cooling him. This was a deep-space 
suit, regulation garb when going out- 
side the pressure hull of an FTL 
ship. It was good up to at least five 
hundred degrees in thin air, per- 
haps three or four hundred in dense. 
In thin air or in space it was the 
elastic joints and couplings that de- 

15 




polymerized when the heat grew 
too great; in dense air, with conduc- 
tion pouring energy in faster than 
the cooling coils could suck it out 
and hurl it away, it was the refrig- 
erating equipment that broke down. 

McCray had no way of knowing 
just how hot it was going to get. 
Nor, for that matter, had the suit 
been designed to operate in a cor- 
rosive medium. 

All in all it Was time for him to 
do something. 

A mong the debris on the floor, he 
remembered, was a five-foot 
space-ax, tungsten-steel blade and 
springy aluminum shaft. 

McCray caught it up and headed 
for the door. It felt good in his 
gauntlets, a rewarding weight; any 
weapon straightens the back of the 
man who holds it, and McCray was 
grateful for this one. With something 
concrete to do he could postpone 
questioning. Never ‘mind why be 
had been brought here; never mind 
how. Never mind what he would, or 
could, do next; all those questions 
could recede into the background of 
his mind while he swung the ax and 
battered his way out of this poison- 
ed oven. 

Crash-clangl The double jolt ran 
up the shaft of the ax, through his 
gauntlets and into his arm; but he 
was making progress, he could see 
the plastic — or whatever it was — 
of the door. It was chipping out. Not 
easily, very reluctantly; but flaking 
out in* chips that left a white pow- 
dery residue. 

At this rate, he thought grimly, 
he would be an hour getting through 
it. Did he have an hour? 

But it did not take an hour. One 
blow was luckier than the rest; it 

16 



must have snapped the lock mech- 
anism. The door shook and slid ajar. 
McCray got the thin of the blade in- 
to the crack and pried it wide. 

He was in another room, maybe 
a hall, large and bare. 

McCray put the broad of his back 
against the broken door and pressed 
it as nearly closed as he could; it 
might not keep the gas and heat out, 
but it would retard them. 

The room was again unlighted — 
at least to McCray’s eyes. .There was 
not even that pink pseudo-light that 
had baffled him; here was nothing 
but the beam of his suit lamp. What 
it showed was cryptic. There were 
evidences of use: shelves, boxy con- 
traptions that might have been cup- 
boards, crude level surfaces attached 
to the walls that might have been 
workbenches. Yet they were queerly 
contrived, for it was not possible to 
guess from them much about the 
creatures who used them. Some were 
near the floor, some at waist height, 
some even suspended from the ceil- 
ing itself. A man would need a lad- 
der to work at these benches and 
McCray, staring, thought briefly of 
many-armed blind giants or shape- 
less huge intelligent amoebae, and 
felt the skin prickle at the back of 
his neck. 

He tapped half-heartedly at one of 
the closed cupboards, and was not 
surprised when it proved as refrac- 
tory as the door. Undoubtedly he 
could batter it open, but it was not 
likely that much would be left of its 
contents when he was through; and 
there was the question of time. 

But his attention was diverted by 
a gleam from one of the benches. 
Metallic parts lay heaped in a pile. 
He poked at them with a stiff-finger- 
ed gauntlet; they were oddly fami- 




liar. They were, he thought, very 
much like the parts of a bullet-gun. 

In fact, they were. He could rec- 
ognized barrel, chamber, trigger, 
>even a couple of cartridges, neatly 
opened and the grains of powder 
stacked beside them. It was an old- 
er, clumsier model than the kind he 
had seen in survival locker, on the 
Jodrell Bank — and abruptly wish- 
ed he were carrying now — but it 
was a pistol. Another trophy, like 
the strange assortment in the other 
room? He could not guess. But the 
others had been more familiar; they 
all have come from his own ship. 
He was prepared to swear that noth- 
ing like this antique had been 
aboard. 

The drone began again in his ear, 
as it had at five-minute intervals all 
along: 

“Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, 
Herrell McCray, this is Jodrell Bank 
calling Herrell McCray . .” 

And louder, blaring, then fading 
to normal volume as the AVC cir- 
cuits toned the signal down, another 
voice. A woman’s voice, crying out 
in panic and fear: “ Jodrell Bank l 
Where are you? Help!” 

IV 

H atcher’s second in command 
said: “He has got through the 
first survival test. In fact, he broke 
his way out! What next?” 

“Wait!” Hatcher ordered sharply. 
He was watching the new specimen 
and a troublesome thought had oc- 
curred to him. The new one was fe- 
male and seemed to be in pain; but 
it was not the pain that disturbed 
Hatcher, it was something far more 
immediate to his interests. 

“I think,” he said slowly, “that 
they are in contact.” 



His assistant vibrated startlemenC 
“I know,” Hatcher said, “but 
watch. Do you see? He is going 
straight toward her.” 

Hatcher, who was not human, did 
not possess truly human emotions; 
but he did feel amazement when he 
was amazed, and fear when there 
was cause to be afraid. These speci- 
mens, obtained with so much diffi- 
culty, needed so badly, were his re- 
sponsibility. He knew the issues in- 
volved much better than any of his 
helpers. They could only be surpris- 
ed at the queer antics of the aliens 
with attached limbs and strange 
powers. Hatcher knew that this was 
not a freak show, but a matter of 
life and death. He said, musing: 
“This new one, I cannot com- 
municate with her, but I get — al- 
most — a whisper, now and then. 
The first one, the male, nothing. But 
this female is perhaps not quite 
mute.” 

“Then shall we abandon him and 
work with her, forgetting the first 
one?” 

Hatcher hesitated. “No,” he said 
at last. “The male is responding well. 
Remember that when last this ex- 
perment was done every subject 
died; he is alive at least. But I am 
wondering. We can’t quite communi- 
cate with the female — ” 

“But?” 

“But I’m not sure that others 
can’t.” 

T he woman’s voice was at such 
close range that McCray’s suit 
radio made a useful RDF set. He 
located her direction easily enough, 
shielding the tiny built-in antenna 
with the tungsten-steel blade of the 
ax, while she begged him to hurry. 
Her voice was heavily accented, with 

17 




some words in a language he did not 
recognize. She seemed to be in 
shock. 

McCray was hardly surprised at 
that; he had been close enough to 
shock himself. He tried to reassure 
her as he searched for a way out of 
the hall, but in the middle of a word 
her voice stopped. 

He hesitated, hefting the ax, glan- 
cing back at the way he had come. 
There had to be a way out, even if 
it meant chopping through a wall. 

When he turned around again 
there was a door. It was oddly shap- 
ed and unlike the door he had hewn 
through, but clearly a door all the 
same, and it was open. 

McCray regarded it grimly. He 
went back in his memory with meti- 
culous care. Had he not looked at* 
this very spot a matter of moments 
before? He had. And had there been 
an open door then? There had n6t. 
There hadn’t been even a shadowy 
outline of the three-sided, uneven 
opening that stood there now. 

Still, it led in the proper direction. 
McCray added one more inexplic- 
able fact to his file and walked 
through. He was in another hall — 
or tunnel — rising quite steeply to 
the right. By his reckoning it was the 
proper direction. He labored up it, 
sweating under the weight of the 
suit, and found another open door, 
this one round, and behind it — 

Yes, there was the woman whose 
voice he had heard. 

It was a woman, all right The 
voice had been so strained that he 
hadn’t been positive Even now, 
short black hair might not have 
proved it. and she was lying face 
down but the waist and hips were 
a woman’s, even though she wore a 
bulky, auilted suit of coveralls. 

18 



He knelt beside her and gently 
turned her face. 

She was unconscious. Broad, dark 
face, with no make-up; she was ap-*- 
parently in her late thirties. She ap- 
peared to be Chinese. 

She breathed, a little raggedly but 
without visible discomfort; her face 
was relaxed as though she were 
sleeping. She did not rouse as he 
moved her. 

He realized she was breathing the 
air of the room they were in. 

His instant first thought was that 
she was in danger of asphyxiation; 
he started to leap up to get, and put 
her into, the small, flimsy space 
suit he saw slumped in a corner. At 
second thought he realized that she 
would not be breathing so comfort- 
ably if the air were full of the pois- 
onous reek that had driven him out 
of the first room. 

There was an obvious conclusion 
to be drawn from that; perhaps he 
could economize on his own air re- 
serve. Tentatively he cracked the 
seal of his faceplate and took a cau- 
tious breath. The faint reek of halo- 
gens was still there, but it was not 
enough even to make his eyes water, 
and the temperature of the air was 
merely pleasantly warm. 

He shook her. but she did not 
wake. 

He stood up and regarded her 
thoughtfully. It was a disappoint- 
ment. Her voice had given him hope 
of a companion, someone to talk 
things over with, to compare notes 
— someone "who. if not possessing 
any more answers than himself, 
could at least serve as a sounding- 
board in the give-and-take of dis- 
cussion that might make some sort 
of sense out of the queerness that 
permeated this place. 




What he had instead was anoth- 
er burden to carry, for she was un- 
able to care for herself and surely 
he could not leave her in this condi- 
tion. 

H e slipped off the helmet absent- 
ly and pressed the buttons that 
turned off the suit’s cooling units, 
looking around the chamber. It was 
bare except for a litter of irrelevant 
human articles — much like the one 
in which he himself had first appear- 
ed, except that the articles were not 
Jodrell Bank's. A woven cane screen, 
some cooking utensils, a machine 
like a desk calculator, some books 
— he picked up one of the books 
and glanced at it. It was printed on 
coarse paper, and the text was in 
ideographs, Chinese, perhaps; he did 
not know Oriental languages. 

McCray knew that the Jodrell 
Bank was not the only FTL vessel in 
this volume of space. The Betel- 
guese run was a busy one, as FTL 
-shipping lanes went: Almost daily 
departures from some point on 
Earth to one of the colonies, with 
equal traffic in the other direction. 

Of course, if the time-lag in com- 
munication did not lie, he was no 
longer anywhere within that part of 
the sky; Betelgeuse was only a few 
hundred light-years from Sol, and 
subspace radio covered that distance 
in something ’ ke fifty minutes. But 
suppose the woman came from an- 
other ship; perhaps a Singapore or 
Tokyo vessel, on the same run. She 
might easily have been trapped as 
he was trapped. And if she were 
awake, he could find out from her 
what had happened, and thus learn 
something that might be of use. 

Although it was hard to see what 
might be of use in these most unpre- 



cedented and unpleasant circum- 
stances. 

The drone from Jodrell Bank be- 
gan again: “Herrell McCray, Her- 
rell McCray, Herrell McCray, this 
is Jodrell Bank responding — ” 

He turned the volume down but 
did not dare turn it off. He had lost 
track of time and couldn’t guess 
when they would respond to. his last 
message. He needed to hear that re- 
sponse when it came. Meanwhile, 
what about his fellow-captive? 

Her suit was only a flimsy work- 
about model, a airtight as his but 
without the bracing required for 
building jet propulsors into it. It 
contained air reserves enough, and 
limited water; but neither food nor 
emergency medical supplies. 

McCray had both of these, of 
course. It was merely one more rea- 
son why he could not abandon her 
and go on . if, that is, he could 
find some reason for going in one 
direction preferably to another, and 
if a wall would conveniently open 
again to let him go there. 

He could give her an injection of 
a stimulant, he mused. Would that 
improve the situation? Not basical- 
ly, he decided, with , some regret. 
Sleep was a need, not a luxury; it 
would not help her to be awakened 
chemically, when body was demon- 
strating its need for rest by refusing 
to wake to a call. Anyway, if she 
were not seriously injured she would 
undoubtedly wake of her own ac- 
cord before long. 

He checked pulse and eye-pupils; 
everything normal, no evidence of 
bleeding or somatic shock. 

So much for that. At least he had 
made one simple decision on his 
own, he thought with grim humor. 
To that extent he had reestablished 



19 




his mastery of his own fate, and it 
made him feel a touch better. 

Perhaps he could make some 
more. What about trying to find a 
way out of this place, for instance? 

I t was highly probable that they 
would not be able to stay here 
indefinitely, that was the first fact 
to take into account. Either his im- 
agination was jumpy, or the reek of 
halogens was a bit stronger. In any 
case there was no guarantee that this 
place would remain habitable any 
longer than the last, and he had to 
reckon with the knowledge that a 
spacesuit’s air reserve was not in- 
finite. These warrens might prove a 
death trap. 

McCray paused, leaning on the 
haft of his ax, wondering how much 
of that was reason and how much 
panic. He knew that he wanted, 
more than anything to get out of 
this place, to see sky and stars, to 
be where no skulking creatures be- 
hind false panels in the walls, or 
peering through televiewers conceal- 
ed in the furnishings, could trick 
and trap him. But did he have any 
reason to believe that he would be 
better off somewhere else? Might it 
not be even that this place was a 
sort of vivarium maintained for his 
survival — that the leak of poison 
gases and heat in the first room was 
not a deliberate thrust at his safety, 
but a failure of the shielding that 
alone could keep him alive? 

He didn’t know, and in the nature 
of things could not. But paradoxical- 
ly the thought that escape might in- 
crease his danger made him all the 
more anxious to escape. He wanted 
to know. If death was waiting for 
him outside his chamber, McCray 
wanted to face it — now — while 



he was still in good physical shape. 

While he was still sane. For there 
was a limit to how many phenomena 
he could store away in the back of 
his mind; sooner or later the^epn- 
tradictions, the puzzles, the fears 
would have to be faced. 

Yet what could he do with the 
woman? Conceivably he could carry 
her; but could he also carry her 
suit? He did not dare take her with- 
out it. It would be no kindness to 
plunge her into another atmosphere 
of poison, and watch her die because 
he had taken her from her only hope 
of safety. Yet the suit weighed at 
least fifty pounds. His own was 
slightly more; the girl, say, a hun- 
dred and thirty. It added up to more 
mass than he could handle, at least 
for more than a few dozen yards. 

The speaker in his helmet said 
suddenly: “Herrell McCray, this is 
Jodrell Bank. Your transmission re- 
ceived. We are vectoring and ranging 
your signal. Stand by. We will call 
again in ten minutes.” And, in ^dif- 
ferent tone: “God help you,' Mac. 
What the devil happened to you?” 

It was a good question. McCray 
swore uselessly because he didn’t 
know the answer. 

He took wry pleasure in imagining 
what was going on aboard Jodrell 
Bank at that moment. At least not 
all the bewilderment was his own. 
They would be utterly baffled. As 
far as they were concerned, their 
navigator had been on the bridge at 
one moment and the next moment 
gone, tracelessly. That in itself was 
a major puzzle; the only way off an 
FTL ship in flight was in the direc- 
tion called “suicide.” That would 
have been their assumption, all right, 
as soon as they realized he was gone

and checked the ship to make sure 
he was not for some reason wander- 
ing about in a cargo hold or uncon- 
scious in a closet after some hard- 
to-imagine attack from another 
crewman. They would have thought 
that somehow, crazily, he had got 
into a suit — there was the suit — 
and jumped out of a lock. But there 
would have been no question of go- 
ing back to look for him. True, they 
could have tracked his subspace ra- 
dio if he had used it. But what 
would have been the good of that? 
The first question, an all but unan- 
swerable one, would be how long 
ago he had jumped. Even if they 
knew that, Jodrell Bank , making 
more than five hundred times light- 
speed, could not be stopped in fewer 
than a dozen light-years. They could 
hardly hope to return to even ap- 
proximately the location in space 
where he might have jumped; and 
there was no hope of reaching a po- 
sition, stopping, casting about, start- 
ing again — the accelerations were 
too enormous, a man too tiny a dust- 
mote. 

And, of course, he would have 
been dead in the first place, anyway. 
The transition from FTL drive to 
normal space was instantly fatal ex- 
cept within the protecting shield of 
a ship’s engines. 

So they would have given him up 
and, hours later — or days, for he 
had lost track of time — they would 
have received his message. What 
would they make of that? 

He didn’t know. After all, he 
hardly knew what he made of it 
himself. 

The woman still slept. The way 
back was still open. He could tell 
by sniffing the air that the poisons 
in the atmosphere were still gaining. 

22 



Ahead there was nothing but blank 
walls, and the clutter of useless 
equipment littering the floor. Stolidly 
McCray closed his mind and waited. 

The signal came at last. 

“Mac, we have verified your posi- 
tion.” The voice was that of Captain 
Tillingher, strained and shaking. “I 
don’t know how you got there, but 
unless the readings lie you’re the 
hell of a long way off. The bearing 
is identical with Messier object 
M-42 and the distance — ” ragged- 
ly — ” is compatible. About a thou- 
sand light years from us, Mac. One 
way or another, you’ve been kid- 
naped. I— I—” 

The voice hesitated, unable to say 
what it could not accept as fact but 
could not deny. “I think,” it manag- 
ed at last, “that we’ve finally come 
across those super-beings in space 
that we’ve wondered about.” 

H atcher’s detached limbs were qui- 
vering with excitement — and 
with more than excitement, because 
he was afraid. He was trying t6 con- 
ceal from the others just how afraid 
he was. 

His second in command reported: 
“We have the second subject out of 
consciousness. How long do you 
want us to keep her that way?” 
“Until I tell you otherwise! How 
about the prime subject?” 

“We can’t tell, Hatcher. But you 
were right. He is in communication 
with others, it seems, and by para- 
normal means.” Hatcher noted the 
dismay in what his assistant said. 
He understood the dismay well 
enough. It was one thing to work on 
a project involving paranormal for- 
ces as an exercise in theory. It was 
something else entirely to see them 
in operation. 




But there was more cause for dis- 
may than that, and Hatcher alone 
knew just how bad the situation 
was. He summoned one of his own 
members to him and impressed on it 
a progress report for the Council. He 
sent it floating through the long 
warrens of his people’s world, order- 
ed his assistants back to their work 
and closed in his thoughts to con- 
sider what had happened. 

These two creatures, with their 
command of forces in the paranor- 
mal — i.e., the electromagnetic — 
spectrum, seemed able to survive in 
the environments prepared for them. 
That was step one. No previous 
team had done as well. This was 
not the first time a probe team of 
his race had snatched a warmblood- 
ed biped from a spaceship for study 
— because their operation forces, 
psionic in nature, operated in non- 
Euclidean ways, it was easiest for 
them to make contact with the crew 
of a ship in the non-Euclidean space 
FTL drive. 

But it was the first time that the 
specimens had survived. He review- 
ed the work they had already done 
with the male specimen. He had 
shown himself unable to live in the 
normal atmospheric conditions of 
Hatcher’s world; but that was to be 
expected, after all, and the creature 
had been commendably quick about 
getting out of a bad environment. 
Probably they had blundered in il- 
luminating the scene for him, Hat- 
cher conceded. He didn’t know how 
badly he had blundered, for the con- 
cept of “light” from a general 
source, illuminating not only what 
the mind wished to see but irrele- 
vant matter as well, had never oc- 
curred to Hatcher or any of his race; 
all of their senses operated through 



the mind itself, and what to them 
was “light” was a sort of focusing 
of attention. But although something 
about that episode which Hacher 
failed to understand had gone 
wrong, the specimen had not been 
seriously harmed by it. The speci- 
men was doing well. Probably they 
could now go to the hardest tesf of 
all, the one which would mean suc- 
cess or failure Probably they could 
so modify the creature as to make 
direct communication possible. 

And the other specimen? 

Hatcher would have frowned, if 
he had had brow muscles to shape 
such an expression — or a brow to 
be shaped. The female specimen was 
the danger. His own people knew 
how to shield their thoughts. This 
one evidently did not. It was aston- 
ishing that the Old Ones had not al- 
ready encountered these bipeds, so 
loosely guarded was their radiation 
— when they radiated at all, of 
course, for only a few of them seem- 
ed to possess any psionic power 
worth mentioning. 

Hatcher hastily drove that thought 
from his mind, for what he proposed 
to do with the male specimen was 
to give him that power. 

And yet there was no choice for 
Hatcher’s people, because they were 
faced with disaster. Hatcher, through 
his communications from the Coun- 
cil, knew how close the disaster was. 
When one of the probers from the 
Central Masses team disappeared, 
the only conclusion that could be 
drawn was the Old Ones had dis- 
covered them. They needed allies; 
more, they needed allies who had 
control of the electromagnetic for- 
ces that made the Old Ones so po- 
tent and so feared. 

In the male and female they had 

23 




snatched out of space they might 
have found those allies. But anoth- 
er thought was in Hatcher’s mind: 
Suppose the Old Ones found them 
too? 

Hatcher made up his mind. He 
could not delay any longer. 

“Open the way to the surface,” 
he ordered. “As soon as possible, 
take both of them to where we can 
work.” 

T he object Captain Tillinger had 
called “M-42” was no stranger 
to Herrell McCray. It was the Great 
Nebula in Orion, in Earth’s tele- 
scopes a fuzzy patch of light, in cold 
fact a great and glowing cloud of 
gas. M-42 was not an external gal- 
axy, like most of the “nebulae” in 
Messier’s catalogue, but it was noth- 
ing so tiny as a single sun either. Its 
hydrogen mass spanned dozen of 
light-years. Imbedded in it — grow- 
ing in it, as they fed on the gas that 
surrounded them — were scores of 
hot, bright new suns. 

New suns. In all the incongruities 
that swarmed around him McCray 
took time to consider that one par- 
ticular incongruity. The suns of the 
Orion gas cloud were of the spectral 
class called “B” — young suns, less 
than a thousandth as old as a Sol. 
They simply had not been in exis- 
tence long enough to own stable 
planetary systems — much less 
planets which themselves were old 
enough to . have cooled, brewed 
chemical complexes and thus in time 
produced life. But surely he was on 
a planet . 

Wasn’t he? 

McCray breathed a deep sigh and 
for one more time turned his mind 
away from unprofitable speculations. 
The woman stirred slightly. McCray 

24 



knelt to look at her; then, on quick 
impulse, opened his medical kit, 
took out a single-shot capsule of a 
stimulant and slipped it neatly ©to 
the exposed vein of her arm. 

In about two minutes she would 
be awake. Good enough, thought 
McCray; at least he would have 
someone to talk to. Now if only they 
could find a way out of this place. 
If a door would open, as the other 
door had, and — 

He paused, staring. 

There was another door. Open. 

He felt himself swaying, threw 
out an arm and realized that he was 
. falling? Floating? Moving to- 
ward the door, somehow, not as 
though he were being dragged, not 
as though he were walking, but sure- 
ly and rather briskly moving along. 

His feet were not touching the 
ground. 

It wasn’t a volitional matter. His 
intentions had nothing to do with it. 
He flailed out, and touched nothing; 
nor did he slow his motion at alt. JJs 
fought against it, instinctively; and 
then reason took over and he stop- 
ped. 

The woman’s form lifted from the 
floor ahead of him. She was still un- 
conscious. From the clutter on the 
floor, her lightweight space suit rose, 
too; suit and girl, they floated ahead 
of him, toward the door and out. 

McCray cried out and tried to 
run after them. His legs flailed and, 
of course, touched nothing; but it 
did seem that he was moving faster. 
The woman and her suit were disap- 
pearing around a bend, but he was 
right behind them. 

He became conscious of the re- 
turning reek of gases. He flipped up 
the plate of his helmet and lunged 
at the girl, miraculously caught her 




in one hand and, straining, caught 
the suit with the other. 

Stuffing her into the suit was 
hfcid. awkward work, like dressing 
a doll that is too large for its gar- 
ments; but he managed it, closed her 
helmet, saw the flexible parts of her 
suit bulge out slightly as its auto- 
matic pressure regulators filled it 
with air. 

They drove along, faster and fas- 
ter, until they came to a great por- 
tal, and out into the blinding radi- 
ance of a molten copper sky. 

G athered in a circle were a score 
or more of Hatcher’s people. 
McCray didn’t know they were 
Hatcher's people, of course. He did 
not know even that they were ani- 
mate beings, for they lacked all the 
features of animals that he had been 
used to. No eyes. No faces. Their 
detached members, bobbing about 
seemingly at random, did not appear 
to have any relation to the irregular 
'Inheres that were their owners. 

The woman got unevenly to her 
feet, her faceplate staring toward 
the creatures. McCray heard a 
smothered exclamation in his suit- 
phones. 

“Are you all right?’ he demanded 
sharply. The great crystal eye turned 
round to look at him. 

“Oh, the man who spoke to me.” 
Her voice was taut but controlled. 
The accent was gone; her control 
was complete. “I am Ann Mei-Ling, 
of the Woomara. What are — those?” 
McCray said, “Our kidnappers, I 
guess. They don’t look like much, 
do they?” 

She laughed shakily, without an- 
swering. The creatures seemed to 
be waiting for something, McCray 
thought; if indeed they were crea- 



tures and not machines or — or 
whatever one might expect to find, 
in the impossible event of being cast 
away on an improbable planet of an 
unexplored sun. He touched the 
woman’s helmet reassuringly and 
walked toward the aliens, raising his 
arms. 

“Hello,” he said. “I am Herrell 
McCray.” 

He waited. 

He half turned; the woman watch- 
ing him. “I don’t know what to do 
next,” he confessed. 

“Sit down,” she said suddenly. He 
stared. “No, you must! They want 
you to sit down.” 

“I didn’t hear — ” he began, then 
shrugged. He sat down. 

“Now lie stretched out and open 
your face mask.” 

“Here? Listen — Ann — Miss Mei- 
Ling, whatever you said your name 
was! Don’t you feel the heat? If I 
crack my mask — ” 

“But you must.” She spoke very 
confidently. “It is s’ in fo — what do 
you call it — telepathy, I think. But 
I can hear them. They want you to 
open your mask. No, it won’t kill 
you. They understand what they 
are doing.” 

She hesitated, then said, with less 
assurance, “They need us, McCray. 
There is something ... I am not 
sure, but something bad. They need 
help, and think you can give it to 
them. So open your helmet as they 
wish, please.” 

McCray closed his eyes and grim- 
aced; but there was no help for it, 
he had no better ideas. And anyway, 
he thought, he could close it again 
quickly enough if these things had 
guessed wrong. 

The creatures moved purposefully 

25 




toward McCray, and he found him- 
self the prisoner of a dozen unat- 
tached arms. Surprised, he struggled, 
but helplessly; no, he would not be 
able to close the plate again! . 
But the heat was no worse. Some- 
how they were shielding him. 

A tiny member, like one of the 
unattached arms but much smaller, 
writhed through the air toward him, 
hesitated over his eyes and released 
something tinier still, something so 
small and so close that McCray 
could not focus his eyes upon it. 
It moved deliberately toward his 
face. 

The woman was saying, as if to 
herself, “The thing they fear is — 
far away, but — oh, no! My God!” 

There was a terrible loud scream, 
but McCray was not quite sure he 
heard it. It might have been his 
own, he thought crazily; for that 
tiny floating thing had found his 
face and was burrowing deep inside; 
and the pain was beyond belief. 

he pain was incredible. 

It was worse than anything he 
had ever felt, and it grew . and 
then it was gone. 

What it was that the spheroidal 
aliens had done to his mind McCray 
had no way of learning. He could 
only know that a door had been 
open. An opaque screen was re- 
moved. He was free of his body. 

He was more than free, he was 
extended — increased — enlarged. He 
was inside the body of an alien, and 
the alien^was in him He was also 
outside both, looking at them. 

McCray had never felt anything 
like it in his life. It was a situation 
without even a close analogue. He 
had had a woman in his arms, he 
had been part of a family, he had 

26 



shared the youthful sense of explor- 
ation that comes in small, eager 
groups: These were the compari- 
sons that came to his mind. This waj 
so much more than any of these 
things. He and the alien — he and, 
he began to perceive, a number of 
aliens — were almost inextricably 
mingled. Yet they were separate, as 
one strand of colored thread in a 
ball of yarn is looped and knotted 
and intertwined with every other 
strand, although it retains its own 
integrity. He was in and 'among 
many minds, and outside them all. 

McCray thought: This is how a 
god must feel. 

* * * 

Hatcher would have laughed— if 
he had lips, larynx or mouth to 
laugh with. He would have laughed 
in pure exultation, and, indeed, his 
second in command recognized the 
marionette quivering of his detached 
limbs as a shout of glee. “We’ve 
done it,” cried the assistant, catch- 
ing his delight. “We’ve made thg. 
project work!” 

“Weve done a great deal more 
than that,” exulted Hatcher. “Go to 
the supervisors, report to them. Pass 
on the word to the Central Masses 
probe. Maintain for the alien the 
pressure and temperature value he 
needs — ” 

“And you, Hatcher?” 

“I’m going with him — out in the 
open! I’m going to show him what 
we need!” 

H atcher. McCray recognized that 
this was a name — the name of 
the entity closest to himself, the one 
that had somehow manipulated his 
forebrain and released the mind 
from the prison of the skull. “Hatch- 
er” was not a word but an image, 





and in the image he saw a creature 
whose physical shape was unpleas- 
ant, but whose instincts and hopes 
were enough like his own to provide 
common ground. 

He saw more than that. This 
Hatcher was trying to persuade 
him to move. To venture farther. 
To come with him . 

McCray allowed himself to be 
lead and at once he was outside not 
only of his own body but of all 
bodies. He was free in space. 

The entity that had been born 
of Herrell McCray was now larger 
than a sun. He could see, all around 
him, the wonder and beauty of the 
great gas cloud in which his body 
rested, on one tiny planet of one 
trivial star His sense of time was 
not changed from what it had been 
— he could count the pulses of his 
own body, still thudding in what, 
however remote, was his ear — but 
he could see things that were terribly 
slow and vast. He could see the 
Inotion of the streamers of gas in 
the cloud as light-pressure drove 
them outward. He could hear the 
subtle emanations of ion clashing 
with hurtling ion. He could see the 
great blue new suns tunneling 
through the cloud, building their 
strength out of the diffuse con- 
taminated hydrogen that made the 
Orion nebula, leaving relatively clear 
“holes” behind them. He could see 
into the gas and through it. He could 
perceive each star and gassy comet; 
and he could behold the ordered 
magnificence of the galaxy of stars, 
and the universe of galaxies, beyond. 

The presence beside him was urg- 
ing him to look beyond, into a 
denser, richer region of suns. Mc- 
Cray, unsure of his powers, stretched 
toward it — and recoiled. 



There was something there which 
was terrifying, something cold and 
restless that watched him come to-* 
ward it with the eyes of a crouched 
panther awaiting a deer. 

The presence beside him felt 
the same terror, McCray knew. -He 
was grateful when Hatcher allowed 
him to look away from the central 
clusters and return to the immediate 
neighborhood of his body. 

Like a child’s toy in a diminishing 
glass, McCray could see the planet 
he had left. 

But it was no planet. It was not 
a planet, but a great irregular sphere 
of metal, honeycombed and war- 
rened. He would have thought it a 
ship, though huge, if it had had en- 
gines or instruments . No. It was 
a ship. Hatcher beside him was 
proof that these creatures needed 
neither, not in any Earthly sense, 
at least. They themselves were en- 
gines, with their power to move 
matter apart from the intervention 
of other matter. They themselves 
were instruments, through the sensing 
of force, that was now within his 
own power. 

A moment’s hesitant practice, and 
McCray had the “planet” in the 
palm of his hand — not a real palm, 
not a real hand; but it was there for 
his inspection. He looked at it and 
within it and saw the interior nests 
of Hatcher’s folk, found the room 
where he had been brought, traced 
his course to the surface, saw his 
own body in its spacesuit, saw beside 
it the flaccid suit that had held the 
strange woman’s body . 

The suit was empty. 

The suit was empty, and in the 
moment of that discovery McCray 
heard a terrible wailing cry — not in 
his ears, in his mind — from the 

27 




aliens around him* The suit was 
empty. They discovered it the same 
moment as he. It was wrong and it 
was dangerous; they were terrified. 

The companion presence beside 
him receded into emptiness. In a 
moment McCray was back in his 
own body, and the gathering mem- 
bers let him free. 

VI 

S ome hundreds of light-years away, 
the Jodrell Bank was making 
up lost time on its Betelgeuse run. 

Herrell McCray swept the long 
line from Sol to Betelgeuse, with his 
perceptions that were not his eyes 
and his touch that was not of matter, 
until he found it. The giant ship, 
fastest and hugest of mankind’s star 
vessels, was to him a lumbering tiny 
beetle. 

It held friends and something 
else — something his body needed — 
air and water and food. McCray did 
not know what would happen to 
him if, while his mind was out in 
the stars, his body died. But he was 
not anxious to find out. 

McCray had not tried moving his 
physical body, but with what had 
been done to his brain he could now 
do anything within the powers of 
Hatcher’s people. As they had swept 
him from ship to planet, so he could 
now hurl his body back from planet 
to ship. He flexed muscles of his 
mind that had. never been used be- 
fore, and in a moment his body 
was slumped on the floor of the 
Jodrell Bank’s observation bubble. 
In another moment he was in his 
body, opening his eyes and looking 
out into the astonished face of Chris 
Stoerer, his iunior navigator. ‘‘God 
is heaven,” whispered Stoerer, “it's 
you!” 

28 



“It is,” said McCray hoarsely, 
dirough lips that were parched and 
cracked, sitting up and trying the 
muscles of the body. It ached. He 
was bone- weary. “Give me a hand 
getting out of this suit, will you?” 

It was not easy to be a mind in 
a body again, McCray discovered. 
Time had stopped for him. He had 
been soaring the star-lanes in his re- 
leased mind for hours; but while 
his mind had been liberated, his 
body, back on Hatcher’s “planet,” 
had continued its slow metabolism, 
its steady devouring of its tissues, 
its inevitable progress toward death. 
When he had returned to it he found 
its pulse erratic and its breathing 
ragged. A grinding knot of hunger 
seethed in its stomach. Its muscles 
ached. 

Whatever might become of his 
mind, it was clear that his body 
would die if it were left unfed and 
uncared-for much longer. So he had 
brought it back to the Jodrell Bank * 
He stood up and avoided Chris’s 
questions. “Let me get something to 
eat, and then get cleaned up a little.” 
(He had discovered that his body 
stank.) “Then I’ll tell you every- 
thing you want to know — you and 
the captain, and anybody else who 
wants tp listen. And we’ll have to 
send a dispatch to Earth, too, be- 
cause this is important . But, 
please, I only want to tell it once.” 
Because — he did not say — I may 
not have time to tell it again. 

For those cold and murderous 
presences in the clustered inner suns 
had reached out as casually as a 
bear flicking a salmon out of a 
run and snatched the unknown 
woman from Hatcher’s planet. They 
could reach anywhere in the galaxy 
their thoughts roamed. 




They might easily follow him 
here. 

I t was good to be human again, 
and McCray howled with pain 
and joy as the icy needle-spray of 
the showers cleansed his body. He 
devoured the enormous plates of 
steak and potatoes the ship’s gal- 
ley shoved before him, and drank 
chilled milk and steaming black 
coffee in alternate pint mugs. Mc- 
Cray let the ship’s surgeon look him 
over, and laughed at the expression 
in the man’s eyes. “I know I’m a 
little wobbly,” he said. “It doesn’t 
matter, Doc. You can put me in 
the sickbay as long as you like, as 
soon as I’ve talked to the captain. 
I won’t mind a bit. You see, I won’t 
be there — ” and he laughed louder, 
and would not explain. 

An hour later, with food in his 
belly and something from the sur- 
geon’s hypospray in his bloodstream 
to clear his brain, he was in the 
captain’s cabin, trying to spell out 
in words that made sense the in- 
credible story of (he discovered) 
eight days since he had been abduc- 
ted from the ship. 

Looking at the ship’s officers, 
good friends, companions on a doz- 
en planetside leaves, McCray started 
to speak, stumbled and was for a 
moment without words. It was too 
incredible to tell. How could he 
make them understand? 

They would have to understand. 
Insane or not, the insane facts had 
to be explained to them. However 
queerly they might stare, they were 
intelligent men. They would resist 
but ultimately they would see. 

He settled his problem by telling 
them baldly and plainly, without 
looking at their faces and without 



waiting for their questions, every- 
thing that had happened. He told 
them about Hatcher and about the 
room in which he had come to. 
He told them about the pinkish 
light that showed only what he 
concentrated on — and explained it 
to them, as he had not understood it 
at first; about Hatcher’s people, 
and how their entire .sense-world 
was built up of what humans called 
E.S.P., the “light” being only the 
focusing of thought, which sees no 
material objects that it is not fixed 
on. He told them of the woman from 
the other ship and the cruel, surgical 
touch on his brain that had opened 
a universe to him. He promised that 
that universe would open for them as 
well. He told them of the deadly, 
unknowable danger to Hatcher’s 
people — and to themselves — that lay 
at the galaxy’s core. He told them 
how the woman had disappeared, 
and told them she was dead — at 
the hands of the Old Ones from the 
Central Masses — a blessing to her, 
McCray explained, and a blessing 
to all of them; for although her 
mind would yield some of its secrets 
even in death, if she were alive it 
would be their guide, and the Old 
Ones would be upon them. 

He did not wait for them to react. 
He turned to the ship’s surgeon. 
“Doc, I’m all yours now, body and 
soul . cancel that. Just body!” 
And he left them, to swim once 
more in space. 

I n so short a time McCray had 
come to think of this as life, and 
a sort of interregnum. He swept up 
and out, glancing back only to see 
the ship’s surgeon leaping forward 
to catch his unconscious body as 
it fell and then he was in space 

29 




between the stars once more. 

Here, ’twixt Sol and Betelgeuse, 
space was clear, hard and cold, no 
diffuse gas cloud, no new, growing 
suns He “looked” toward Hatch- 
er’s world, but hesitated and con- 
sidered. 

First or last, he would have to 
look once more upon the inimical 
presences that had peered out at him 
from the Central Masses. It might 
as well be now. 

His perceptions alert, he plunged 
toward the heart of the galaxy 

Thought speeds where light plods. 
The mind of Herrell McCray cov- 
ered light-millenia in a moment. It 
skipped the drifty void between spi- 
ral arms, threaded dust clouds, en- 
tered the compact central galactic 
sphere to which our Earth’s sector 
of the galaxy is only a remote and 
unimportant appendage. Here a 
great globular cluster of suns 
massed around a common center of 
gravity. McCray shrank himself to 
the perspective of a human body 
and stared in wonder. Mankind’s 
Sol lies in a tenuous, stretched-out 
arm, thinly populated by stellar 
standards: if Earth had circled one 
of these dense-clustered suns, what 
a different picture of the sky would 
have greeted the early shepherds! 
Where Man’s Earthbound eyes are 
fortunate to count a thousand stars 
in a winter sky, here were tens of 
thousands, bright enough to be a 
Sirius or a Capella at the bottom 
of a sink of atmosphere like Earth’s 
— tens of billions of stars in all, 
whirling close to each other, so that 
star greets star over distances that 
are hardlv more than planetary. 
$ol’s nearest neighbor star is four 
light-years away. No single sun in 
this dense, gyrating central mass was 

30 



as much as one light-year from its 
fellows. 

Here were suns that had been 
blazing with mature, steady light 
when Sol was a mere contracting 
mass of hydrogen — whose planets 
had cooled and spawned life before 
Earth’s hollows cupped the first 
scalding droplets that were the be- 
ginnings of seas. 

On these ancient worlds life ex- 
isted. 

McCray had not understood all of 
what Hatcher had tried to cbmmuni- 
cate to him, but he had caught the 
terror in Hatcher’s thoughts. Hatch- 
er’s people had fled from these an- 
cients many millenia before — fled 
and hidden in the heart of the Orion 
gas cloud, their world and all. Yet 
even there they were not safe. They 
knew that in time the Old Ones 
would find them. And it was this 
fear that had led them to kidnap 
humans, seeking allies in the war 
that could not forever be deferred. 

Hatcher’s people were creatures-ef 
thought. Man was the wielder of 
physical forces — “paranormal” to 
Hatcher, as teleportation and mind- 
seeing were “paranormal” to Mc- 
Cray. The Old Ones had mastered 
both. 

McCray paused at the fringe of 
the cluster, waiting for the touch of 
contemptuous hate. It came and he 
recoiled a thousand light-years be- 
fore he could stop. 

To battle the Old Ones would be 
no easy match — yet time might 
work for the human race. Already 
they controlled the electromagnetic 
spectrum, and hydrogen fusion could 
exert the force of suns. With Hatch- 
er’s help — and his own — Man would 
free his mind as well; and perhaps 
the Old Ones would find themselves 




against an opponent as mighty as 
themselves. 

He drew back from the Central 
Masses, no longer afraid, and swept 
out to see Hatcher’s planet 
It was gone. 

I n the great gas cloud the tunneling 
blue suns swept up their graze 
of hydrogen, untroubled by planets. 
Themselves too young to have solid 
satellites, Hatcher’s adopted world 
removed again, they were alone. 
Gone! 

It was for a moment, a panicky 
thought. McCray realized what they 
had done. Hatcher’s greatest hope 
had been to find another race to 



stand between his people and the 
Old Ones. And they had found it! 

Now Hatcher’s world could hide 
again and wait until the battle had 
been fought for them. 

With a face light-years across, 
with a brain made up of patterns 
in the ether, McCray grinned* wryly. 

“Maybe they made, the right 
choice,* he thought,- considering. 
“Maybe they’d only be in the way 
when the showdown comes.” And 
he sought out Jodrell Bank and his 
body once more, preparing to re- 
turn to being human . and to 
teach his fellow-humans to be gods.

THE

MIRACLE 

BY CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



Illustrated by Jackson 



I t Cheviot Sherwood evet haa be- 
lieved in miracles, he believed 
in them no longer. He had no illu- 
sions now He knew exactlv what he 
faced 

His life would come to an end on 
this uninhabited backwoods planet 
and there’d be none to mourn him. 
none to know. Not, he thought that 
there would be any mourners, un- 
der any circumstance. Although 
there were those who would be glad 
to see him. who would come run- 
ning if they knew where he might 
be found. 

These were people, very definite- 
ly, that Sherwood had no desire to 

see 

His great, one might say his over- 
whelming. desire not to see them

The castaway was a wanted

how badly he was wanted! 



could account in part for his pre- 
sent situation, since he had taken 
off from the last planet of record 
without filing flight plans and lack- 
ing clearance 

Since no one knew where he 
might have headed and since his 
radio was junk, there was no likeli- 
hood at all that anyone would find 
him — even if they looked, which 
would be a matter of some doubt. 
Probably the most that anyone would 
do would be to send out messages 
to other planets to place authorities 
od the alert for him. 

And since his spaceship, for the 
lack of a certain valve for which he 
had no replacement, was not going 
anywhere, he was stuck here on this 
planet. 




I 




If that had been all there had 
been to it, it might not have been 
80 bad. But there was a final irony 
that under other circumstances (if it 
had been happening to someone else, 
let’s say), would have kept Sherwood 
in stitches of forthright merriment 
for hours on end at the very thought 
of it. But since he was the one in- 
volved, there was no merriment. 

For now, when he could gain no 
benefit, he was potentially rich be- 
yond even his own most greedy and 
most lurid dreams. 

On the ridge above the camp he’d 
set up beside his crippled spaceship 
lay a strip of clay-cemented conglom- 
erate that fairly reeked with dia- 
monds. They lay scattered on the 
hillside, washed out by the weather; 
they were mixed liberally in the 
gravel of the tiny stream that wend- 
ed through the valley. They could 
be picked up by the basket. They 
were of high quality; there were sev- 
eral, the size of human skulls, that 
probably were priceless. 

Sherwood was of a hardy, rough 
and tumble breed. Once he became 
convinced of his situation he made 
the best of it. He made his camp in- 
to a home and laid in supplies — 
digging roots, gathering nuts, drying 
fish and making pemmican. If he 
was to be cast in the role of a Rob- 
inson Crusoe, he proposed to be at 
least comfortable well fed. 

In his spare time he gathered dia- 
monds. dumping them in a pile out- 
side his shack And in the idle atter- 
noons or the long evenings, he sat 
beside his campfire and sorted them 
out — washing them free of cling- 
ing dirt and grading them according 
to their size and brilliance. The very 
best of them he put into a sack, de- 

34 



signed for easy grabbing if the time 
should ever come when he might 
depart the planet. 

Not that he had any hope this 
would come about. 

Even so, he was a man who plan- 
ned against contingencies. He al- 
ways tried to have some sort of loop- 
hole. Had this not been the case, 
his career would have ended long 
before, at any one of a dozen times 
or places. That it apparently had 
come to an end now could be attri- 
buted to a certain lack df foresight 
in not carrying a full complement of 
spare parts. Although perhaps this 
was understandable, since never be- 
fore in the history of space flight 
had that particular valve which now 
spelled out Sherwood’s doom ever 
misbehaved. 

Perhaps it was well for him that 
he was not an introspective man. If 
he had been given to much searching 
thought, he might have found him- 
self living with his past, and there 
were places in his past that were faf 
from pretty. 

He was lucky in many other ways, 
of course. The planet was not a bad 
one, a sort of New England planet 
with a rocky, tumbled terrain, for- 
ested by scrubby trees and distinctly 
terrestrial. He might just as easily 
have been marooned upon a jungle 
planet or one of the icy planets or 
any of another dozen different kinds 
that were not tolerant of life. 

So he settled in and made the best 
of it and didn’t even bother to count 
off the days. For he knew what he 
was in for. 

He counted on no miracle. 

T he miracle he had not counted 
on came late one afternoon as 
he sat, cross-legged, sorting out his 




latest haul of priceless diamonds. 

The great black ship came in from 
the east across the rolling hills. It 
whistled down across the ridges and 
settled to the ground a short dis- 
tance from Sherwood’s crippled ship 
and his patched-together shack. 

It was no patrol vessel, although 
in his position, Sherwood would 
have welcomed even one of these. 
It was a kmd of ship he’d never seen 
before. It was globular and black 
and it had no identifying marks on 
it. 

He leaped to his feet and ran to- 
ward the ship. He waved his arms in 
welcome and whooped with his de- 
light. He stopped a hundred feet 
away when he felt the first whiff of 
the heat that had been picked up by 
the vessel’s hull in its plunge through 
atmosphere. 

“Hey, in there!” he yelled. 

And the Ship spoke to him. “You 
need not yell,” it told him. “I can 
hear you very well.” 

‘ who are you?” asked Sherwood. 

“I am the Ship,” the voice told 
him. 

“Quit fooling around,” yelled 
Sherwood, “and tell me who you 
are.” 

For the sort of answer it had giv- 
en was foolishness. Of course it was 
the ship. It was someone in the 
ship, talking to him through a 
speaker in the hull. 

“I have told you,” said the Ship. 
“I am the Ship.” 

“But there is someone speaking 
to me.” 

“The ship is speaking to you.” 

“All right, then,” said Sherwood. 
“If you want it that way, it’s okay 
with me. Can you take me out of 
here? My radio is broken and my 
ship disabled.” 



“Perhaps I can,” said the Ship. 
“Tell me who you are.” 

Sherwood hesitated for a moment, 
and then he told who he was, quite 
truthfully. For it suddenly had oc- 
curred to him that this ship was as 
much an outlaw as he was himself. 
It had no markings and all ships 
must have markings. 

“You say you left your last port 
without proper clearance?” . 

“Yes,” said Sherwood. “There 
were certain circumstances.” 

“And no one knows where you 
are? No one’s looking for you?” 
“How could they?” Sherwood 
asked. 

“Where do you want to go?” 
“Just anywhere,” said Sherwood. 
“I have no preference.” 

F or even if they should land him 
somewhere where he had no 
wish to be, he still would have a 
running chance. On this planet he 
had no chance at all. 

“All right,” said the ship. “You 
can come aboard.” 

A hatch came open in the hull 
and a ladder began running out. 

“Just a second,” Sherwood shout- 
ed. “I’ll be right there.” 

He sprinted to the shack and 
grabbed his sack of the finest dia- 
monds, then legged it for the ship. 
He got there almost as soon as the 
ladder touched the ground. 

The hull still was crackling with 
warmth, but Sherwood swarmed up 
the ladder, paying no attention. 

He was set for life, he thought. 
Unless — 

And then the thought struck him 
that they might take the diamonds 
from him. They could pretend it 
was payment for his passage. Or 
they could simply take them with- 

35 




out an excuse of any sort at all. 

But it was too late now He was 
almost in the hatch. To drop the 
sack of diamonds now would do no 
more than arouse suspicion and 
would gain him nothing. 

It came of greediness, he thought. 
He did not need this many dia- 
monds. Just a half dozen of the fin- 
est dropped into his pockets would 
have been enough. Enough to buy 
him another ship so he could return 
and get a load of them. 

But he was committed now. There 
was nothing he could do except to 
see it through. 

He reached the hatch and tumbled 
through it. There was no one wait- 
ing. The inner lock stood open and 
there was no one there. 

He stopped to stare at the empti- 
ness and behind him the retracting 
ladder rumbled softly and the hatch 
hissed to a close. 

“Hey,” he shouted, “where is 
everyone?” 

“There is no one here,” the voice 
said, “but me.” 

“All right,” said Sherwood. 
“Where do I go to find you?” 

“You have found me,” said the 
Ship. “You are standing in me.” 
“You mean . .” 

“I told you,” said the Ship. “I said 
I was the Ship. That is what I am.” 
“But no one . .” 

“You do not understand,” said 
the Ship. “There is no need of any- 
one. I aip myself. I am intelligent. 
I am part machine, part human. Ra- 
ther, perhaps, at one time I was. I 
have thought, in recent years, the 
two of us have merged so we’re nei- 
ther human nor machine, but some- 
thing new entirely.” 

“You’re kidding me,” said Sher- 
wood, beginning to get frightened. 

36 



“There can’t be such a thing.” 
“Consider,” said the Ship, “a cer- 
tain human who had worked for 
years to build me and who, as he 
finished me, found death was clos- 
ing in . .” 

“Let me out!” yelled Sherwood. 
“Let me out of herel I don’t want to 
be rescued. I don’t want . .” 

“I’m afraid, Mr. Sherwood, it is 
rather late for that. We’re already 
out in space.” 

“Out in space! We can’t be! It 
isn’t possible!” 

“Of course it is,” the Ship told him. 
“You expected thrust. There was no 
thrust. We simply lifted.” 

4 4'j^'o ship,” insisted Sherwood, 
“can get off a planet . ” 
“You’re thinking, Mr. Sherwood, 
of the ships built by human hands. 
Not of a living ship. Not of an intel- 
ligent machine. Not of what be- 
comes possible with the merging of 
a man and a machine.” ^ 
“You mean you built yourself?” 
“Of course not. Not to start with. 
I was built by human hands to start 
with. But I’ve redesigned myself 
and rebuilt myself, not once, but 
many times. I knew my capabilities. 
I knew my dreams and wishes. I 
made myself the kind of thing I was 
capable of being — not the halfway, 
makeshift thing that was the best 
the human race could do.” 

“The man you spoke of,” Sher- 
wood said. “The one who was about 
to die . .” 

“He is part of me,” said the Ship. 
“If you must think of him as a sep- 
arate entity, he, then, is talking to 
you. For when I say T, I mean both 
of us, for we’ve become as one.” 

“I don’t get it,” Sherwood told 




the Ship, feeling the panic coming 
back again. 

“He built me, long ago, as a ship 
which would respond, not to the 
pushing of a lever or the pressing 
of a button, but to the mental com- 
mands of the man who drove me. I 
was to become, in effect, an exten- 
sion of that man. There was a hel- 
met that the man would wear and 
he’d think into the helmet.” 

“I understand,” said Sherwood. 
“He’d think into the helmet and 
I was so programmed that I’d obey 
his thoughts. I became, in effect, a 
man, and the man became in effect 
the ship he operated.” 

“Nice deal,” Sherwood said en- 
thusiastically, never being one upon 
whom the niceties of certain advan- 
tages were ever lost. 

“He finished me and he was about 
to die and it was a pity that such a 
one should die — one who had 
worked so hard to do what he had 
done. Who’d given up so much. 

^^'Yf'sver had seen space. Who had 
gone nowhere.” 

“No,” said Sherwood, in revul- 
sion, knowing what was coming. 
“No, he’d not done that.” 

“It was a kindness,” said the ship. 
“It was what he wanted. He man- 
aged it himself. He simply gave up 
his body. His body was a worthless 
hulk that \yas about to die. The 
modifications to accommodate a hu- 
man brain rather than a human 
skull were quite elementary. And 
he has been happy. We have both 
of us been happy.” 

Sherwood stood without saying 
anything. In the silence he was lis- 
tening for some sound, for any kind 
of tiny rattle or hum, for anything 
at all to tell him the ship was oper- 
ating. But there was no sound and 



no sense of motion of any sort. 

“Happy,” he said. “Where would 
you have found happiness? What’s 
the point of all this?” 

“That,” the Ship said solemnly, 
“is a bit hard to explain.” 

Sherwood stood and thought 
about it — the endless voyaging 
through space without a body — 
with all the desires, all the advan- 
tages, all the capabilities' of a body 
gone forever. 

“There is nothing for you to fear,” 
said the Ship. “You need not con- 
cern yourself. We have a cabin for 
you. Just down the corridor, the 
first door to your left.” 

“I thank you,” Sherwood said, 
although he was nervous still. 

If he had had a choice, he told 
himself, he’d stayed back on the 
planet. But since he was here, he’d 
have to make the best of it. And 
there were, he admitted to himself, 
certain advantages and certain pos- 
sibilities that needed further thought. 

H e went down the corridor and 
pushed on the door. It opened 
on the cabin. For a spaceship it 
looked comfortable enough. A lit- 
tle cramped, of course, but then all 
cabins were. Space is at a premium 
on any sort of ship. 

He went in and placed his sack 
of diamonds on the bunk that hing- 
ed out from the wall. He sat down 
in the single metal chair that stood 
beside the bunk. 

“Are you comfortable, Mr. Sher- 
wood?” 

“Very comfortable,” he said. 

It was going to be all right, he 
told himself. A very crazy setup, 
but it would be all right. Perhaps a 
little spooky and a bit hard to be- 
lieve, but probably better, after all, 

37 




than staying marooned, back there 
on the planet. For this would not 
last forever And the planet could 
have been, most probably would 
have been, forever. 

It would take a while to reach an- 
other planet, for space was rather 
sparsely populated in this area. 
There would be time to think and 
plan. He might be able to work out 
something that would be to his great 
advantage. 

He leaned back in the chair and 
stretched out his legs. His brain be- 
gan to click in a ceaseless scurrying 
back and forth, nosing from every 
angle all the possibilities that existed 
in this setup. 

It was nice, he thought — this 
entire operation. The Ship undoubt- 
edly had figured out some angles 
for itself which no human yet had 
thought of. 

There were a lot of things to do. 
He’d have to learn the capabilities of 
the Ship and. give close study to its 
personality, seeking out its weak 
points and its strength. Then he’d 
have to plan his strategy and be 
careful not to give away his think- 
ing. He must not move until he was 
entirely ready. 

There might be many ways to do 
it. There might be flattery or there 
might be a business proposition or 
there might be blackmail. He’d have 
to think on it and study and follow 
out the line of action that seemed 
to be the best 

He wondered at the Ship’s means 
o t operation. Anti-gravity, perhaps, 
so far considered as a source of 
power. 

He got up from the chair and 
paced, three paces across the room 
Or a fusion chamber. Or perhaps 
some method which had not been 



and back, restlessly pondering odds. 

Yes, he thought, It would be a 
nice kind of ship to have. More than 
likely there was nothing in all of 
space that could touch it in speed 
and maneuverability. Nothing that 
could overhaul it should he ever 
have to run. It could apparently set 
down anywhere. It probably self- 
repairing, for the Ship had spoken 
of redesigning and of rebuilding it- 
self. With the memory of his recent 
situation still fresh inside his mind, 
this was comforting. ' 

There must be a way to get the 
Ship, he told himself. There had to 
be a way to get it. It was something 
that he needed. 

He could buy another ship, of 
course; with the diamonds in the 
sacking he could buy a fleet of 
ships. But this was the one he 
wanted. 

M aybe it had been pure luck this 
Ship had picked him up. For 
any other legal ship would probably 
turn him over to the authorities at 
its next port of call, but this Ship 
didn’t seem to mind who he was or 
what his record might be. Any other 
ship that was not entirely legal would 
have grabbed off, not only the dia- 
monds that he had but his discovery 
of the diamond field. But this parti- 
cular Ship had no concern with dia- 
monds. 

What a setup, he thought. A hu- 
man brain and a spaceship tied to- 
gether, so closely tied together that 
their identities had merged. He shiv- 
ered at the thought of it, for it was 
a gruesome thing. 

Although perhaps it had not meant 
too much to that old man who was 
about to die. He had traded an aged 
and death-marked body for many 



38 




years of life. Perhaps life as a part 
of a space-traveling machine was bet- 
ter than no life at all. 

How many years, he wondered, 
had it been since that old man had 
translated himself into something 
else than human? A hundred? Five 
hundred? Perhaps even more than 
that. 

In those years where had he been 
and what might he have seen? And, 
most pertinent of all, what thoughts 
had run through and congealed and 
formed within his mind? What was 
life like for him? Not a human sort 
of life, of course, not a human view- 
point, but something else entirely. 

Sherwood tried to imagine what 
it might be like, but gave up in dis- 
may. It would necessarily be a ne- 
gation of everything he lived for — 
all the sensual pleasure, all the 
dreams of gain and glory, all the 
neat behavior patterns he had set 
up for himself, all his self-made 
rules of conduct and of conscience. 

A miracle, he thought. As a mat- 
ter of fact, there’d been two mir- 
acles. The first had been when he 
had been able to set his ship down 
without a crackup when the valve 
had failed. He had come in close 
above the planet’s surface to find a 
place to land — and suddenly the 
valve went out and the engine fail- 
ed and there he’d been, plunging 
down above the rough terrain. Then 
suddenly he had glimpsed a place 
where a landing might be just bare- 
ly possible and had fought the con- 
trols madly to hit that certain spot 
and finally had hit it — alive. 

It had been a miracle that he had 
made the landing; and the coming 
of the Ship to rescue him had been 
the second miracle. 

The bunk dropped down flat 



against the wall and his sack of dia- 
monds was dumped onto the floor* 

“Hey, what goes on?” yelled Sher- 
wood. Then he wished he had not 
yelled, for it was quite clear exactly 
what had happened. The support 
that held the bunk had not been 
snapped properly into place and had 
given way, letting down the bunk. 

“Something wrong, Mr. Sher- 
wood?” asked the Ship. 

“No, not a thing,” said Sherwood. 
“My bunk fell down. I guess it 
startled me.” 

He bent down to pick up the dia- 
monds. As he did, the chair quietly 
and efficiently slid back against the 
wall, folded itself up and slid into 
a slight depression that exactly fit- 
ted it. 

Squatted to pick up the diamonds, 
Sherwood watched the chair in hor- 
rified fascination, then swiftly spun 
around. The bunk no longer hung 
against the wall, also had fitted itself 
into another niche. 

Cold fear speared into Sherwood. 
He rose swiftly to his feet, turning 
like a man at bay. He stood in a 
bare cubicle. With both the bunk 
and chair retracted, he stood within 
four bare walls. 

He sprang toward the door and 
there wasn’t any door. There was 
only wall. 

He staggered back into the center 
of the cubicle and spun around to 
view each wall in turn. There was 
no door in any of the walls. The 
metal went up from floor to ceiling 
without a single break. 

The walls began to move, closing 
in on him, sliding in, retracting. 

H e watched, incredulous, frozen, 
thinking that perhaps he’d im- 
agined the moving of the walls. 



39 




But it was not imagination. Slow- 
ly, inexorably, the walls were closing 
in. Had he put out his arms, he 
could have touched them on either 
side of him. 

“Ship!” he said, fighting to keep 
his voice calm. 

“Yes, Mr. Sherwood.” 

“You are malfunctioning. The 
walls are closing in.” 

“No,” said the Ship. “No mal- 
function, I assure you. A very pro- 
per function. My brain grows tired 
and feeble. It is not the body only — 
the brain also has its limits. I sus- 
pected that it might, but I could not 
know. There was a chance, of 
course, that separated from the poi- 
son of a body, it might live in its 
bath of nutrients forever.” 

“Nof” rasped Sherwood, his 



breath strangling in his throat. “No, 
not me!” 

“Who else?” asked the Ship. “I 
have searched for years and you are 
the first who fitted.” 

“Fitted!” Sherwood screamed. 

“Why, of course,” the Ship said 
calmly, happily. “A man who would 
not be missed. No one knowing 
where you were. No one hunting 
for you. No one who will miss you. 
I had hunted for someone like you 
and had despaired of finding one. 
For I am humane. I would cause no 
one grief or sadness.” 

The walls kept closing in. 

The Ship seemed to sigh in metal- 
lic contentment. 

“Believe me, Mr. Sherwood,” it 
said, “finding you was a very mir- 
acle.” END

IF • Short Story 



THIS WAY 
TO THE EGRESS 

BY ANDREW FETLER 

He heard children’s voices, but 
there couldn’t be any children 
— not in that terrible place! 



CCTn the middle of the night,” the 
A man said to the landlady 
over a soft-boiled egg and a slice of 
toast. “Right under my window.” He 
leaned forward. “You know how 
children talk to themselves?” 

“Was it the same voice you heard 
the first two nights?” Mrs. Tilton 
asked. 

“I’m not sure now about the first 
night. Might have been another 
voice that first night.” 

“And now it was a child?” 
“Yes.” . 

Mrs. Tilton rose to get the coffee. 
“Are you quite sure?” 

“You don’t think I’m imagining?” 
“We have no children,” she said. 
“A neighbor’s, no doubt.” 

“There isn’t a child in the whole 
village, Mr. Coat.” 

“That’s what puzzles me. Don’t 
you think we ought to report it?” 
“I’ll get your coffee,” she said, 
and went into the kitchen. 



“I didn’t actually see the child,” 
he called to her. “But I’m sure I 
heard the voice.” 

The woman brought the cup of 
coffee; she had poured it in the kit- 
chen. The first two mornings, he re- 
membered, she had set the coffee 
pot on the table. 

“Aren’t you having any?” he ask- 
ed. 

“I had mine, thank you. Will you 
want anything else?” 

He could see past her into the kit- 
chen — the corner of a large wood- 
burning stove and a row of brass 
pots. The floor was flagstoned and 
a hand pump stood over a sink. 

“Do you really grow your own 
strawberries?” he asked. 

“Yes. Would you like some?” 
“Very much.” 

Mrs. Tilton went to get the ber- 
ries. She had forgotten to serve 
cream with the coffee. The coffee 
had a bitter taste and a faint smell 



41 



of iodine. But he was not used to 
natural coffee. And without cream. 
He took another sip and slowly 
stretched his stiff legs. In the win- 
dow he saw lilac bushes in bloom. 

“Picked this morning,” Mrs. Til- 
ton said, setting a bowl of straw- 
berries before him. 

“Oh, thank you.” He sniffed at 
the berries. “They smell of earth,” 
he said, smiling at her. 

“You might like a walk after 
breakfast,” Mrs. Tilton suggested. 
“Then you can have a restful nap 
at noon.” 

“Good idea,” he said. “Excuse 
me, but the coffee seems bitter.” 
Mrs. Tilton looked at the old man 
as if she did not understand. 

“I’m afraid I’m a nuisance,” he 
apologized, “but I take cream with 
my coffee.” 

“I’m sorry, I forgot.” 

She brought a small cream pit- 
cher. 

T he old man turned the pitcher 
in his hand. It was lopsided 
and made of inferior clay “Do you 
make your own pottery, too?” 
“Such as it is.” 

“Charming.” He set down the 
pitcher and leaned back with a sigh. 
“You know. 1 pretended I did not 
want a rest, but l could hardly wait 
to see the country again.” 

“You weren’t born in the city?” 
“I was born in a village no larger 
than this*. Of course it’s all gone now, 
swallowed up by the city But in 
those davs it was an hour’s heliride 
from the city. I remember a thing 
or two ” 

Mrs. Tilton watched him drink 
the coffee 

“Not many people left who re- 
member those days,” he said. “For 

42 



instance, did you know that unad- 
justables — they called them crimin- 
als then — were actually electrocuted? 
Strapped down to a horrible chair — ” 

“Don’t you want the strawberries, 
Mr. Coat?” 

He looked down at the strawber- 
ries in the bowl. “Just imagine — ” 
but he forgot what he had wanted 
to say. 

The woman went into the kitchen. 

He had just finished drinking the 
coffee when he he&rd the child’s 
voice in the lane outside the win- 
dow. The same voice. He crossed to 
the window and looked out. The 
lane was empty. 

“Mrs. Tilton!” 

He heard no answer. 

He went into the kitchen. The 
door to the garden stood open. He 
saw her working in a vegetable 
patch. 

“Pst . pst!” 

She looked up. 

“Did you see the child?” he call- 
ed. “It must have turned into the 
garden.” 

Mrs. Tilton straightened herself, 
holding her back with both hands. 
“The child?” 

“The voice. I just heard it again.” 

“I’ll be with you in a moment, 
Mr. Coat.” 

He looked round the kitchen — 
the antique flagstones, the brass pots, 
the stove, the hand pump. There was 
only one anachronism: on the wall 
by the door, stuck behind a cluster 
of radishes, was a World Union 
Telegram. 

Out in the vegetable patch, he saw 
Mrs. Tilton was looking about for 
something. 

On an impulse he took down the 
telegram, and read:

He stuck the telegram behind the 
radishes and looked out the door. 
Mrs. Tilton was coming with a bas- 
ket on her arm. 

“You heard the child again, Mr. 
Coat?” 

“Perhaps ... I was mistaken.” 
“Strange, I saw nobody.” She put 
the basket on the kitchen table; it 
was filled with peas. “Did you have 
enough coffee?” 

He nodded. 

“Aren’t you feeling well?” 

“I . am fine. Yes.” 

The executioner looked as if she 
could not make up her mind about 
him. Then she smiled. She brought 
out a wooden bowl, and sat down at 
the table to shell the peas. 

“Why don’t you take your walk 
now? You’ll enjoy our little market 
place.” 

“Yes.” Such a nice day, he 
thought, shuffling to the window. 
Spring. 

H e had enjoyed the market yes- 
terday until he had noticed 
that there were no children about. 
No children at all. Only adult primi- 
tives and a few well-trained func- 
tionaries like Mrs. Tilton. 



In the sky in the window he saw 
a rocket cutting a thin line as it left 
the atmosphere. 

“I’ll have your bed ready for your 
noon nap,” she said. 

He turned from the window. 
“Noon?” 

“You’ll want a nice restful nap 
then.” 

He had imagined the poisoned 
coffee would work faster. His heart 
beating, he said, “Those are peas, 
aren’t they?” 

She nodded. Her hands were busy 
shelling. “I hung your cane on the 
coat rack,” she said. 

“If you don’t mind, Mrs. Tilton, 
I’d rather not go out today. I’d very 
much like to try shelling peas for 
you.” 

“Why, of course. Pull* up that 
chair, why don’t you?” 

Sitting down, he reached his trem- 
bling hands into the basket and came 
up with a handful of the green won- 
ders. Mrs. Tilton moved the basket 
nearer him. 

“After a while I’ll go up to my 
room,” he promised. “I feel a little 
tired already.” 

“Certainly.” 

He split a shell and slid his thumb 
under the peas. They rolled into his 
hand. He counted nine. He dropped 
them in the bowl, then put one in 
his mouth and chewed. It had a 
sweet taste. 

“Thank you, Mrs. Tilton.” 

“Not at all, Mr. Coat.”

ESSAY 

IN 

COHERENCE 

BY THEODORE STURGEON 



I f you read the above title fast 
you’ll get the same impression 
as you will if you read this article 
fast. So take your time — or set it 
aside until you have the time. 

We have blithely set ourselves the 
task of fumbling through the liver — 
and lights — of the laser , hoping to 
bring you a simple explanation of 
one of those scientific breakthroughs 
that ought to make you glad, and a 
little awed, to share history with. 
But like sex and solid-state func- 
tions, laser theory seems to drift 
from time to time into philosophy 
or fiction Yet the device is so sim- 
ple. so fascinating and so extremely 
potent that it will pay to know a 
little, at least, about it when it’s talk- 
ed about. And, brother, it will be 
talked abouf a whole lot. 

To begin with, Junior, laser is 
not the comparative form of lazy. 
It is the acronym for Light Amplifi- 
cation by Stimulated Emission of 
Radiation. The recipe for a laser is: 
Take a cylindrical ruby rod. Mix 
in a pinch (about l/20th of 1 % ) of 

44 



chromium atoms, making sure that 
that’s absolutely all the impurity 
there is. Grind both ends of the 
cylinder optically flat. Silver one end 
thoroughly. Silver the other end not 
thoroughly. Next take an optical 
flash tube, stretch it out, bend it 
into a spiral and insert the ruby rod 
into the coil so formed. Now acti- 
vate the flash tube at the correct 
frequency. Coherent light emerges 
from the half-silvered end of the 
ruby. And there’s your laser. 

If that doesn’t suit your palate, 
try other solids, such as the so-called 
transition metals (elements with an 
incomplete inner shell of electrons), 
or the “rare-earth” elements (called 
lanthanides), or the actinides (ele- 
ments 89 through 103) But if your 
taste is a little more sophisticated, 
yon can run up something tasty in 
liquids and even gases. 

Now. what is coherent light? And 
why bother? Also, as the ribald In- 
dian said to the mermaid: How? 

Coherent light is electromagnetic 
radiation within the optical spect- 



rum, emerging from its source at a 
single frequency and in a sinusoidal 
wave-pattern, like radio waves. Most 
light is non-coherent, or a jumble 
of many frequencies. If you’ve ever 
seen these separated and put down 
in order by a spectroscope, you 
know how very many there are. The 
light produced by laser is in terms 
of color absolutely pure. It forms a 
beam with so little dispersion that a 
beam one tenth of a mil wide at 
the source would lay a disc of light 
only 20 miles wide on the moon. 
Yet even that, in terms of this new 
science, is strictly model T. 

W hy bother? First of all, the de- 
vice produces light of truly 
fabulous intensity. As every school- 
boy knows as soon as you tell him, 
sunlight produces about one-tenth 
of a watt per square centimeter. A 
laser can give you 10 billion watts 
on the same square centimeter and 
not breathe hard. It is, in other 
words, a source of high temperatures, 
almost perfectly directional, easily 
controlled and (as such things go) 
inexpensive. Just a moment’s re- 
flection (especially for you, or you 
wouldn’t be reading it here) will 
generate more wild and wonderful 
applications than most pro authors 
would dare to perpetrate. In research 
and industry, how many uses can 
be found for a needle-beam of heat 
that can weld a precision joint, punc- 
ture a diamond, maintain a micro- 
crucible at high temperatures to 
study chemistry in an area it has 
hardly been examined in before? In- 
stantly din, exactly directional. 



Or — think a little bigger, and put 
Buck Rogers’ zap-gun back in the 
funny papers where it belongs. For 
here is the death ray, the recoilless 
“searing beam of raw naked energy” 
we used to read about in our fuzz- 
edged pulp-blurred space opera. 
Here — really here — is a way4o knock 
a hole as big as your head in a 
tank at 2000 yards— ^-a weapon that 
ignores windage because it’s a beam, 
not a missile-chucker, and for the 
same reason need not be aimed with 
any consideration for trajectory. 
You don’t compute and adjust sights. 
You just shoot it, like a flashlight. 

And this is only the beginning. 
Practical thermonuclear energy 
awaits temperatures high enough, 
controllable enough. Well? 

And one other whole new area: 
communications — which covers a 
great deal more than speech, pic- 
tures, facsimile; it means also re- 
mote control in all its countless per- 
mutations. For with a laser beam 
we have, as reported above, electro- 
magnetic radiation of a single fre- 
quency which varies in a regular sin- 
usoidal pattern — like a radio carrier 
frequency. There is no theoretical 
reason why a signal should not be 
impressed upon such a carrier, by 
modifying its amplitude (AM) after 
it’s generated. This means, at first 
glance, two things: communications 
on such a tight beam that eaves- 
dropping is virtually impossible; and 
communications over a beam with 
so little dispersal that it can be thrown 
hundreds of thousands, even millions 
of miles, to reach ships and sta- 
tions in space. And with this we’ll 

45 




leave the eight billion and two other 
applications to your imagination, and 
go on to how this simple-minded 
gadget makes this all happen. 

T 'o understand it you’ll have to 
make yet another change in your 
concept of the atom, which, you’ll 
recall, appears as a billard ball glued 
to a stick in chemical models of 
molecules: or as a sort of solar sys- 
tem, electrons around a nucleus, 
when they’re talking nuclear phys- 
ics. There’s nothing wrong with these 
concepts as long as they work, and 
they have worked well. 

According to the theory which fits 
the facts for laser, electrons can 
travel in orbits far removed from 
the nucleus, or closer in. When an 
electron falls from a high energy 
state (the far-out orbit) to a low- 
er state it gives off the energy 
difference in the form of light. Con- 
versely, when it leaves a lower orbit 
for a higher (i.e., goes from a lower- 
energy state to a higher-energy state) 
it absorbs light. 

The brilliant Max Planck reduced 
the calculation of energy difference 
between levels to a simple formula 
( E=hv , in case you wondered, where 
E is the quantum of energy, v the 
frequency of radiation, and h is that 
constant of proportionality known 
as Planck’s Constant.) The only rea- 
son for bringing this up is that fre- 
quency, the only variable in the 
equation, is what dictates whether 
or not electrons can be shifted from 
one level to another. Therefore the 
frequency of the pulses in the helical 
flash tube must be exact and precise 

46 



in terms of the particular atoms of 
which the laser is made. 

Now let’s make another model, 
not of atoms specifically, but of this 
laser theory in action. We’ll borrow 
from the local dog kennels a lad- 
der, and set it up against the living 
room wall. Now if you’ll look close- 
ly you’ll see that the bottom rung of 
the ladder is populated by fleas. We’ll 
call them atoms at Energy Level 
One, or E-l. Now if you can per- 
suade these fleas to' jump to the 
second rung, E-2 — say by flashing 
pictures of a fat chihuahua (at the 
right frequency, of course) — they will 
absorb light energy as they go up. 
They won’t stay on E-2 very long, 
and when they drop back, they’ll 
release energy. Now if you can pump 
the succulent image efficiently 
enough, you’ll get a population in- 
version. There will be more fleas 
on E-2 than on E-l. This would 
give you a gain in emitted energy as 
they dropped back again. 

In practice, it has been found 
that the E-2-to-ground pumping re- 
quires more energy in the pump than 
you can get out of the emission. 
However, with the right frequency, 
at the right intensity, the population 
can get so excited that it will jump 
clear to E-3 and then drop back to 
E-2. At this level you start to show 
a profit, but good. So with a new 
slide, say a particularly fat old col- 
lie substituting for the chihuahua, 
you very readily get population in- 
version between E-2 and E-3, and 
you have a bunch of wildly excited 
fleas as well, which is the excitement 
mentioned in the s e — stimulated 




emission — of laser. The profit is the 
a, or amplification. 

N ow return the ladder to the ken- 
nels. Keep the fleas or let them 
go; it’s up to you. And let’s take up 
the ruby laser again. 

You recall that in the pure ruby 
shaft, a few chromium atoms exist 
as an impurity. When light at the 
right frequency is pumped in by the 
spiral coil, these chromium atoms 
are driven to higher energy levels, 
from which they spontaneously fall 
back, emitting radiation which in 
turn excites more chromium atoms. 
This goes on while more and more 
light goes bashing around inside 
the rod. Both ends are mirrors, and 
the sides permit little of it to es- 
cape, so the only way out for the 
light is for that portion of it which 
bounces off the fully silvered end 
and is projected at the partly sil- 
vered end, where it emerges. Now 



you can see why the beam is so little 
dispersed, so perfectly aligned. Ai 
to why it is so pure — it has to be, 
having been generated from the same 
energy level of the same electron- 
activity. That is, at the same fre- 
quency. The flash-tube that started 
all this was non-coherent— rthat is, 
its light was the usual mess of fre- 
quencies emitted by . most of our 
familiar light-seurces. The laser beam 
is coherent. We hope we are by now, 
and you too. 

Experiments are rapidly going 
forward in both liquid and gaseous 
lasers. If anyone has succeeded with 
the former, we haven’t heard about 
it yet. As to the later, it was a heli- 
um-neon laser which yielded the 10 
billion watt/cm 2 mentioned above. 
He was excited by radio-frequency 
energy and transferred its excitement 
to the neon. Pumping is consider- 
ably easier than for solid lasers. 
Any questions? END

PODKAYNE OF MARS 

BY ROBERT A. HEINLEIN 



SECOND OF THREE PARTS 



Illustrated by Finlay 



A radiation storm between planets is 
no joke — but it’s nothing compared 
to the storm that hovers constantly 
over the head of my brother Clarkl 



SYNOPSIS 

My name is Podkayne Fries — rhymes with “breeze” — and 
don't call me Martian. I am a Marswoman; and they are something 
else entirely. ( Not that you will ever hear me saying anything 
against the Old Ones — after all Vm named after one of them.) My 
brother Clark and I, handsomely escorted by our Uncle Tom , are 
on our way to Venus. Since l am going to be a ship's captain when 
/ grow up ( don't laugh ; on Mars we don't have these silly notions 
about where woman's place is), you might say that this is the 
crowning experience of my life — so far, anyway — and you would 
be right. Except for a few old biddies who think Marsmen are 
savages, everybody is wonderful and the trip itself is positively 
heaven. As for the old biddies . I can fix them. / already have 
fixed them — / told Clark about them , and that's enough. / don't 
know what he'll do — but 1 know they'll wish he hadn't . be - 
cause although he's my brother and l love him , / guess Clark is 
also a powerful little imp. You've heard of Earth's Mafia? The 
way we look at it, the Mafia have heard of Clark — thafs why they 
stayed on Earth. 




VII 

M r. Sawonavong told me that 
we are likely to have a ra- 
diation storm almost any time now 
and that we’ll have an emergency 
drill today to practice for it. The 
solar weather station on Mercury 
reports that “flare” weather is shap- 
ing up and has warned all ships in 
space and all manned satellites to 
be ready for it. The flares are ex- 
pected to continue for about — 
Wups! The emergency alarm 
caught me in the middle of a sen- 
tence. We’ve had our drill and I 
think the captain has all the pass- 
engers properly scared now. Some 
ignored the alarm, or tried to. where- 
upon crewmen in heavy armor 
fetched them. Clark got fetched. He 
was the very last they tracked down 
. and Captain Darling gave him 
a public scolding that was a work 
of art. and finished by warning 
Clark that if he failed to be the first 
passenger to reach shelter the next 
time the alarm sounded, Clark could 
expect to spend the rest of the trip 
in the shelter, twenty-four hours of 
the day, instead of having free run 
of passenger country. 

Clark took it with his usual wood- 
en face, but I think it hit home, 
especially the threat to confine him. 
Tm sure the speech impressed the 
other passengers. It was the sort 
that raises blisters at twenty paces. 
Perhaps the captain intended it most- 
ly for their benefit. 

Then the captain changed his tone 
to that of a patient teacher and ex- 
plained in simple words what we 
could expect, why it was necessary 
so 



to reach shelter at once even if one 
were taking a bath, why we would 
be perfectly safe if we did. 

The solar flares trigger radiation, 
he told us, quite ordinary radiation, 
much like X-rays (“and other sorts,” 
I mentally added), the sort of ra- 
diation which is found in space at all 
times. But the intensity reaches 
levels from a thousand to ten thou- 
sand times as high as “normal” 
space radiation — And, since we are 
already inside the orbit of Earth, this 
is bad medicine indeed; it would kill 
an unprotected man about as quickly 
as shooting him through the head. 

Then he explained why we would 
not require a thousand to ten thou- 
sand times as much shielding in 
order to be safe. It’s the cascade 
principle. The outer hull stops over 
90 per cent of any radiation; then 
comes the “cofferdam” (cargo holds 
and water tanks) which absorbs 
some more; then comes the inner 
hull which is actually the floor of the 
the cylinder which is first-class pas- 
senger country. 

This much shielding is plenty 
for all normal conditions. The ra- 
diation level in our staterooms is 
lower than it is at home, quite a 
lot lower than it is most places on 
Earth, especially in the mountains. 
(I’m looking forward to seeing real 
mountains. Scary!) 

Then one day comes a really bad 
storm on the Sun and the radiation 
level jumps suddenly to 10,000 
times normal — and you could get 
a killing dose right in your own bed 
and wake up dying. 




N o trouble. The emergency shel- 
ter is at the center of the 
ship, four shells farther in, each of 
which stops more than 90 per cent 
of what hits it. Like this: 

10,000 

1,000 (after the first inner shell, 
the floor or first-class 
passenger country.) 

100 (after the second inner 
shell) 

10 (third) 

1 (fourth — and you’re in- 
side the shelter) 

But actually the shielding is bet- 
ter than that and it is safer to be 
in the ship’s shelter during a bad 
solar storm than it is to be in Mar- 
sopolis. 

The only trouble — and no small 
matter — is that the shelter space 
is the geometrical care of he ship, 
just abaft the control room and not 
a whole lot bigger. Passengers and 
crew are stacked into it about as 
intimately as puppies in a basket. 
My billet is a shelf space half a 
meter wide, half a meter deep and 
just a trifle longer than I am, with 
other females brushing my elbows 
on each side of me. I am not a 
claustrophobe, but a coffin would 
be roomier. ' 

Rations are canned ones, kept 
there against emergencies; sanitary 
facilities can only be described as 
“dreadful.” I hope this storm is only 
a solar squall and is followed by 
good weather on the Sun. To finish 
the trip to Venus in the shelter would 
turn a wonderful experience into a 
nightmare. 

The captain finished by saying, 



“We will probably have five to ten 
minutes warning from Hermes Sta- 
tion. But don’t take five minutes 
getting here. The instant the alarm 
sounds head for the shelter at once 
as fast as possible. If you are not 
dressed, be sure you have clothes 
ready to grab — and dress wheit you 
get here. If you stop to worry about 
anything, it may kill you. 

“Crewmen will search all pas- 
senger spaces the moment the alarm 
sounds, and each one is ordered to 
use force to send to shelter any pas- 
senger who fails to move fast. He 
won’t argue with you. He’ll hit you, 
kick you, drag you — and I’ll back 
him up. 

“One last word. Some of you have 
not been wearing your personal ra- 
diation meters. The law permits me 
to levy a stiff fine for such failure. 
Ordinarily I overlook such technical 
offenses — it’s your health, not 
mine. But, during this emergency, 
this regulation will be enforced. 
Fresh personal meters are now be- 
ing passed out to each of you; old 
ones will be turned over to the sur- 
geon, examined and exposures en- 
tered in your records.” 

He gave the “all clear” order then 
and we all went back down to pas- 
senger country, sweaty and mussed. 
At least I was. I was just washing 
my face when the alarm sounded 
again — and I swarmed up those 
four decks like a frightened cat. 

But I was only a close second. 
Clark passed me on the way. 

I t was just another dill. This time 
all passengers were in the shel- 
ter within four minutes. 



51 




The captain didn’t say anything 
but looked pleased. 

I've been sleeping raw but I’m 
going to wear pajamas tonight and 
all nights until this is over, and 
leave a robe where 1 can grab it. 
Captain Darling is a darling but I 
think he means exactly what he says 
— and I won’t play Lady Godiva. 
There isn't a horse in the whole ship. 

Neither Mrs. Royer nor Mrs, 
Garcia were at dinner this evening, 
although they were both amazingly 
agile both times the alarm sounded. 
They weren’t in the lounge after 
dinner; their doors are closed, and 
I saw the surgeon coming out of 
Mrs. Garcia’s room. 

I wonder. Surely Clark wouldn’t 
poison them? 

Or would he? I don’t dare ask 
him because of the remote possibil- 
ity that he might tell me. 

I don’t want to ask the surgeon, 
either, because it might attract at- 
tention to the Fries family. But I 
surely would like to have ESP sight 
(if there truly is such a thing) long 
enough to find out what is behind 
those two closed doors. 

I hope Clark hasn't let his talents 
run away with him Oh, I’m as angry 
at those two as ever because 
there is just enough truth in the 
nasty things tjiey said to make it hurt. 
I am of mixed races and I know 
that some people think that is bad, 
even though there is no bias against 
it on Mars, i do have “convicts” 
among my ancestors — but Pve 
never been ashamed of it. Or not 
much, although I suppose Pm in- 
clined to dwell more on the highly 

52 



selected ones. But a “convict” is not 
always a criminal. Admittedly there 
was that period in the early history 
of Mars when the commissars were 
running things on Earth and Mars 
was used as a penal colony; every- 
body knows that and we don’t try 
to hide it. 

But the vast majority of the trans- 
portees were political prisoners — 
“counter-revolutionists” — enemies 
of the people. Is this bad? 

In any case there was the much 
longer period, involving fifty times 
as many colonists, when every new 
Marsman was selected as carefully 
as a bride selects her weddine gown 
— and much more scientifically. 
And finally, there is the current per- 
iod, since our Revolution and In- 
dependence. when we dropped all 
bars to immigration and welcome 
anyone who is healthy and has nor- 
mal intelligence. 

No, I’m not ashamed of my an- 
cestors or my people, whatever 
their skin shades or backgrounds; 
I’m proud of them. It makes me boil- 
ing mad to hear anyone sneer at 
them Why, I’ll bet those two 
couldn’t qualify for permanent visa 
even under our present “open door” 
policy? Feeble-minded — 

But I do hope Clark hasn’t done 
anything too drastic I wouldn’t 
want Clark to have to spend the rest 
of his life on Titan; I love the little 
writch. Sort of. 

vra 

W e’ve had the radiation storm. 
1 prefer hives. 

I don’t mean the storm itself; k 




wasn’t too bad. Radiation jumped to 
about 1500 times normal for where 
we are now — about eight-tenths of 
an astronomical unit from the Sun, 
say 120,000,000 kilometers in units 
you can get your teeth in. Mr. 
Savvonavong says that we would 
have been all right if the first-class 
passengers had simply gone up one 
deck to second-class passenger 
country . which certainly would 
have been more comfortable than 
stuffing all the passengers and crew 
into that maximum-safety mauso- 
leum at the center of the ship. Sec- 
ond - class accommodations are 
cramped and cheerless, and as for 
third class I would rather be ship- 
ped as freight. But either one would 
be a picnic compared with spend- 
ing eighteen hours in the radiation 
shelter. 

For the first time I envied the half 
dozen aliens aboard. They don’t 
take shelter; they simply remain 
locked in their specially conditioned 
staterooms as usual. No, they aren’t 
allowed to fry. Those ‘^’’-number- 
ed rooms are almost at the center 
of the ship anyhow, in officers’ and 
crew’s country, and they have their 
own extra layer of shielding, because 
you can’t expect a Martian, for ex- 
ample, to leave the pressure and 
humidity he requires and join us hu- 
mans in the shelter. It would be 
equivalent to dunking him in a bath 
tub and holding his head under. If 
he had a head, I mean. 

Still, I suppose eighteen hours of 
discomfort is better than being seal- 
ed into one small room for the whole 
trip. A Martian can simply con- 




template the subtle difference be- 
tween zero and nothing for that 
long or longer and a Venerian just 
estivates. But not me. I need unrest 
oftener than I need rest — or my 
circuits get tangled and smoke pours 
out of my ears. 

But Captain Darling couldn’t know 
ahead of time that the storm would 
be short and relatively mild. He 
had to assume the worst and protect 
his passengers and crew. Eleven 
minutes would have been long 
enough for us to be in the shel- 
ter, as shown later by instrument 
records. But that is hindsight 
and a captain doesn’t save his ship 
and the lives depending on him by 
hindsight. 

I am beginning to realize that be- 
ing captain isn’t all glorious ad- 
venture and being saluted and wear- 
ing four gold stripes on your shoul- 
ders. Captain Darling is younger 
than Daddy and yet he has worry 
lines that make him look years old- 
er.

Query: Poddy, are you sure you 
have what it takes to captain an ex- 
plorer ship? 

Answer : What did Columbus have 
that you don’t? Aside from Isabella, 
I mean. Semper toujours, girls! 

I spent a lot of time before the 
storm in the control room. 
Hermes Solar Weather Station 
doesn’t actually warn us when the 
storm is coming; what they do is 
fail to warn us that the storm is not 
coming. That sounds silly but here 
is how it works: 

The weathermen at Hermes are 
perfectly safe, as they are under- 
ground on the dark side of Mer- 
cury. Their instruments peek cau- 
tiously over the horizon in the twi- 
light zone. They gather data about 
Solar weather, including running 
telephotos at several wave lengths. 

But the Sun takes about twenty- 
five days to turn around, so Her- 
mes Station can’t watch all of it all 
the time. Worse yet, Mercury is go- 
ing around the Sun in the same direc- 
tion that the Sun rotates, taking 
eighty-eight days for one lap. So 

54 



when the Sun again faces where 
Mercury was, Mercury has moved 
on. What this adds up to is that 
Hermes Station faces exactly the 
same face of the Sun about every 
seven weeks. 

Which is obviously not good 
enough for weather - predicting 
storms that can gather in a day or 
two, peak in a few minutes, and kill 
you dead in seconds or less. 

So the Solar weather is watched 
from Earth’s Luna and from Venus’s 
satellite station as well, plus some 
help from Deimos. But there is 
speed-of-light lag in getting informa- 
tion from these more distant stations 
back to the main station on Mercury 
— maybe fifteen minutes for Luna 
and as high as a thousand seconds 
for Deimos . not good when sec- 
onds count. 

But the season of bad storms is 
only a small part of the Sun’s cycle 
as a variable star — say about a 
year out of each six. (Real years, I 
mean — Martian years. The Sun’s 
cycle is about eleven of those Earth 
years that astronomers still insist on 
using.) 





That makes things a lot easier. 
Five years out of six a ship stands 
very little chance of being hit by 
a radiation storm. 

But, during the stormy season, 
a careful skipper (the only sort who 
lives to draw a pension) will plan 
his orbit so that he is in the worst 
danger zone, say inside the orbit 
of Earth, only during such time as 
Mercury lies between him and the 
Sun, so that Hermes Station can 
always warn him of coming trouble. 
That is exactly what Captain Darling 
has done. The Tricorn waited at 
Deimos nearly three weeks longer 
than the guaranteed sight-seeing time 
on Mars called for by the Triangle 
Line’s advertising, in order to place 
his approach to Venus so that Her- 
mes Station could observe and warn 
— because we are right in the mid- 
dle of the stormy season. 

I suppose the Line’s business of- 
fice hates these expensive delays — 
Maybe they lose money during the 
stormy season. But three weeks de- 
lay is better than losing a whole 
shipload of passengers. 

But when the storm does start, 
radio communications goes all to 
pieces at once — Hermes Station 
can’t warn the ships in the sky. 

S talemate? Not quite. Hermes Sta- 
tion can see a storm shaping 
up; they can spot the conditions on 
the Sun which are almost certainly 
going to produce a radiation storm 
very shortly. So they send out a 
storm warning — and the Tricorn and 
other ships hold radiation-shelter 
drills. Then we wait . one day, 



two days, or a whole week, and the 
storm fails to develop, or it builds up 
and starts shooting nasty stuff in 
great quantities. 

All during this time the space- 
guard radio station on the dark side 
of Mercury sends a continuous storm 
warning, never an instant’s break, 
giving a running account of how 
the weather looks on fhe Sun. 

— and suddenly it stops. 

Maybe it’s a power failure and 
the standby transmitter will cut in. 
Maybe it’s just a “fade” and the 
storm hasn’t broken yet and trans- 
mission will resume with reassuring 
words. 

But it may be that the first blast 
of the storm has hit Mercury with 
the speed of light, no last-minute 
warning at all, and the station’s eyes 
are knocked out and its voice is 
swallowed up in enormously more 
powerful radiation. 

The officer-of-the-watch in the 
control room can’t be sure and he 
dare not take a chance. The instant 
he loses Hermes Station he slaps 
a switch that starts a big clock with 
just a seond hand. When that clock 
has ticked off a certain number of 
seconds — and Hermes Station is 
still silent — the general alarm 
sounds. The exact number of seconds 
depends on where the ship is, how 
far from the Sun, how much longer 
it will take the first blast to reach 
the ship after it has already hit Her- 
mes Station. 

Now here is where a captain bites 
his nails and gets gray hair and earns 
his high pay . because he has to de- 
cide how many seconds to set that 



55 




clock for. Actually, if the first 
and worst blast is at the speed of 
light, he hasn’t any warning time at 
all — because the break in the ra- 
dio signal from Hermes and that 
first wave front from the Sun will 
reach him at the same instant. Or, 
if the angle is unfavorable, perhaps 
it is his own radio reception that 
has been clobbered, and Hermes 
Station is still trying to reach him 
with a last-moment warning. He 
doesn’t know. 

But he does know that if he 
sounds the alarm and chases every- 
body to shelter every time the ra- 
dio fades for a few seconds, he will 
get people so worn out and dis- 
gusted from his crying “Wolf!” that 
when the trouble really comes they 
may not move fast enough. 

He knows, too, that the outer hull 
of his ship will stop almost any- 
thing in the electromagnetic spec- 
trum. Among photons (and nothing 
else travels at speed-of-light) only 
the hardest X-radiation will get 
through to passenger country and 
not much of that. But traveling along 
behind, falling just a little behind 
each second, is the really dangerous 
stuff — big particles, little particles, 
middle-sized particles, all the debris 
of nuclear explosion. This stuff is 
moving very fast but not quite at 
speed-of-light! He has to get his 
people safe before it hits. 

C aptain Darling picked a delay of 
twenty-five seconds, for where 
we were and what he expected from 
the weather reports. I asked him 
how he picked it and he just grin- 

56 



ned without looking happy and said, 
“I asked my grandfather’s ghost.” 

Five times while I was in the 
control room the officer of the watch 
started the clock . and five times 
contact with Hermes Station was 
picked up again before time ran 
out and the switch was opened. 

The sixth time the seconds trickled 
away while all of us held our breaths 
. and contact with Hermes wasn’t 
picked up again and the alarm 
sounded like the wakeful trump of 
doom. 

The captain looked stony-faced and 
turned to duck down the hatch into 
the radiation shelter. I didn’t move, 
because I expected to be allowed to 
remain in the control room. Strict- 
ly speaking, the control room is 
part of the radiation shelter, since it 
is just above it and is enclosed by 
the same layers of cascade shield- 
ing. 

(It’s amazing how many people 
think that a captain controls his ship 
by peering out a port, as if he were 
driving a sand wagon. But he doesn’t 
of course. The control room is in- 
side, where he can watch things 
much more accurately and con- 
veniently by displays and instru- 
ments. The only viewport in the Tri- 
corn is one at the top end of the 
main axis, to allow passengers to look 
out at the stars. But we have never 
been headed so that the mass of the 
ship would protect that sight-seeing 
room from solar radiation, so it has 
been locked off this whole trip.) 

I knew I was safe where I was, 
so I hung back, intending to take 
advantage of being “teacher’s pet” 




— for I certainly didn’t want to 
spend hours or days stretched out on 
a shelf with gabbling and maybe hys- 
terical women crowding me. 

I should have known. The captain 
hesitated a split second as he started 
down the hatch and snapped, “Come 
along, Miss Fries.” 

I came. He always calls me “Pod- 
dy” — and his voice had spank in 
it. 

Third-class passengers were al- 
ready pouring in, since they have 
the shortest distance to go, and crew 
members were mustering them in 
their billets. The crew has been on 
emergency routine ever since we first 
were warned by Hermes Station, 
with their usual one watch in three 
replaced by four hours on and four 
hours off. Part of the crew had 
been staying dressed in radiation 
armor (which must be very un- 
comfortable) and simply hanging 
around passenger country. They 
can’t take that heavy armor off for 
any reason at all until their reliefs 
show up, dressed also in armor. 
These crewmen are the “chasers” 
who bet their lives that they can 
check every passenger space, root 
out stragglers, and still reach the 
shelter fast enough not to accumu- 
late radiation poisoning. They are 
all volunteers, and the chasers on 
duty when the alarm sounds get a 
big bonus and the other half of 
them who were lucky enough not to 
be on duty get a little bonus. 

T he chief officer is in charge 
of the first section of chasers and 
the purser is in charge of the second. 



But they don’t get any bonus, even 
though the one of them on duty when 
the alarm sounds is by tradition and 
law the last man to enter the safety 
of the shelter. This hardly seems fair 
. but it is considered their honor 
as well as their duty. 

Other crewmen take turns in the 
radiation shelter and are equipped 
with mustering lists and billeting 
diagrams. 

Naturally service has been pretty 
skimpy of late, with so many of 
the crew pulled off their regular 
duties in order to do just one thing 
and do it fast at the first jangle of 
the alarm. Most of these emergency 
duty assignments have to be made 
from the stewards and clerks; en- 
gineers and communicators and such 
usually can’t be spared. So state- 
rooms may not be made up un- 
til late afternoon — unless you make 
your own bed and tidy your room 
yourself, as 1 have been doing — 
and serving meals takes about twice 
as long as usual, and lounge ser- 
vice is almost non-existent. 

But — of course — the passengers 
realize the necessity for this temp- 
orary mild austerity and are grate- 
ful because it is all done for their 
own safety . 

You think so? 

My dear, if you believe that, you 
will believe anything. You haven’t 
Seen Life until you’ve seen a rich, 
elderly Earthman deprived of some- 
thing he feels is his rightful due, 
because he figures he paid for it in 
the price of his ticket. I saw one 
man, perhaps as old as Uncle Tom 
and certainly old enough to know 

57 




better, almost have a stroke. He 
turned purple, really purple, and 
gibbered — all because the bar ste- 
ward didn’t show up on the bounce 
to fetch him a new deck of playing 
cards. 

The bar steward was in armor 
at the time and couldn’t leave his 
assigned area, and the lounge stew- 
ard was trying to be three places at 
once and answer stateroom rings as 
well. This didn’t mean anything to 
our jolly shipmate. He was threat- 
ening to sue the Line and all its 
directors when his speech became in- 
coherent. 

Not everybody is that way, of 
course. Mrs. Grew, fat as she is, 
has been making her own bed and 
she is never impatient. Some others 
who are ordinarily inclined to de- 
mand lots of service have lately been 




making a cheerful best of things. 

But some of them act like chil- 
dren with tantrums. That isn’t pretty 
in children and is even uglier in 
in grandparents. 

The instant I followed the Cap- 
tain into the radiation shelter I 
discovered just how efficient Tricorn 
service can be when it really mat- 
ters. I was snatched — snatched like 
a ball, right out of the air — and 
passed from hand to hand. Of course 
I don’t weigh much at one-tenth 
gravity, all there is at the main axis; 
but it is rather breath-taking. Some 
more hands shoved me on my bil- 
let, already stretched out, as casual- 
ly and impersonally as a housewife 
stows clean laundry, and a voice 
called out, “Fries, Podkayne!” and 
another voice answered, “Check.” 




T he spaces around me, and 
above and below and across 
from me, filled up awfully fast, 
with the crewmen working with 
the unhurried efficiency of automa- 
tic machinery sorting mail capsules. 
Somewhere a baby was crying and 
through it I heard the captain say- 
ing, “Is that the last?” 

“Last one, Captain,” I heard the 
purser answer. “How’s the time?” 
“Two minutes thirty-seven sec- 
onds — and your boys can start 
figuring their pay-off, because this 
one is no drill.” 

“I didn’t think it was, Skipper — 
and I’ve won a small bet from the 
mate myself.” Then the purser walk- 
ed past my billet, carrying someone 
— and I tried to sit up and bump- 
ed my head and my eyes bugged 
out. 

The passenger he was carrying had 
fainted; her head lolled loosely over 
the crook of his arm. At first I 
couldn’t tell who it was — as the 
face was a bright red. And then I 
recognized her and / almost fainted. 
Mrs. Royer! 

Of course the first symptom of any 
bad radiation exposure is erythema. 
Even with a sunburn, or just care- 
lessness with an ultra-violet lamp, the 
first thing you see is the skin turning 
pink or bright red. 

But was it possible that Mrs. Roy- 
er had been hit with so much sharp 
radiation in so very little time that 
her skin had already turned red in the 
worst “sunburn” imaginable? Just 
from being last man in? 

In that case she hadn’t fainted; she 
was dead. 



And if that was true, then it was 
equally true that the passengers who 
were last to reach the shelter must 
all have received several times the 
lethal dosage. They might not feel 
ill for hours yet; they might not die 
for days. But they were just as dead 
as if they were already stretched out 
stiff and cold. 

How many? I had no way of 
guessing. Possibly — “probably” I 
corrected myself — all the first-class 
passengers; they had the farthest 
to go and were most exposed to 
start with. 

Uncle Tom and Clark — 

I felt sudden sick sorrow and wish- 
ed that I had not been in the con- 
trol room. If my brother and Uncle 
Tom were dying. I didn’t want to be 
alive myself. 

I don’t think I wasted any sym- 
pathy on Mrs. Royer. I did feel a 
shock or horror when I saw that 
flaming red face. But, truthfully, I 
didn’t like her. I thought she was a 
parasite with contemptible opinions 
. and, if she had died of heart 
failure instead, I can’t honestly say 
that it would have affected my ap- 
petite. None of us goes around sob- 
bing over the millions and billions of 
people who have died in the past 
. nor over those still living and 
yet to be born whose single certain 
heritage is death (including Pod- 
kayne Fries herself). So why should 
you cry foolish tears simply be- 
cause you happen to be in the 
neighborhood when someone you 
don’t like — despise, in fact — 
comes to the end of her unlovely 
string? 



59 




I n any case, I did not have time 
to feel sorrow for Mrs. Royer; 
my heart was filled with grief over 
my brother and my uncle. I was 
sorry that I hadn’t been sweeter to 
Uncle Tom, instead of imposing on 
him and expecting him always to 
drop whatever he was doing to help 
me with my silly problems. I regret- 
ted all the many times I had fought 
with my brother. After all, he was a 
child and I am a woman; I should 
have made allowances. 

Tears were welling out of my 
eyes and I almost missed the cap- 
tain’s first words: 

“Shipmates,” he said, in a voice 
firm and very soothing — “my crew 
and our guests aboard . this is 
not a drill: this is indeed a radia- 
tion storm. 

“Do not be alarmed. We are all, 
each and every one of us, perfectly 
safe. The surgeon has examined the 
personal radiation exposure meter of 
the very last one to reach the shel- 
ter. It is well within safe limits. 
Even if they were added to the ac- 
cumulated exposure of the most-ex- 
posed person aboard — who is not 
a passenger by the way, but one 
of the ship’s company — the total 
would still be inside the conserva- 
tive maximum for personal health 
and genetic hygiene. 

“Let me say it ‘again. No one has 
been hurt, no one is going to be hurt. 
We are sftnply going to suffer a 
mild inconvenience. I wish I could 
tell you how long we will have to 
remain here in the safety of the 
shelter. But I do not know. It might 
be a few hours, it might be several 

60 



days. The longest radiation storm of 
record lasted less than a week. We 
hope that Old Sol is not bad-tem- 
pered this time. But, until we receive 
word from Hermes Station that the 
storm is over, we will have to stay 
inside here. Once we know a storm 
is over it usually does not take too 
long to check the ship and make 
sure that your usual comfortable 
quarters are safe. Until then ... be 
patient and be patient with each 
other.” 

I started to feel better as soon as 
the captain started to talk. His voice 
was almost hypnotic; it had the 
soothing all-better-now effect of a 
mother reassuring a child. I relaxed 
and was simply weak with the after- 
effects of my fear. 

But presently I began to wonder. 
Would Captain Darling tell us that 
everything was all right when really 
everything was All Wrong simply 
because it was too late and nothing 
could be done about it? 

I thought over everything I had 
ever learned about radiation poison- 
ing, from the simple hygiene they 
teach in kindergarten to a tape be- 
longing to Mr. Clancy that I had 
scanned only that week. 

And I decided that the captain 
had been telling the truth. 

W hy? Because, even if my worst 
fears had been correct, and 
we had been hit as hard and unex- 
pectedly as if a nuclear weapon had 
exploded by us, nevertheless some- 
thing can always be done about it. 
There would be three groups of us — 
those who hadn’t been hurt at aH 




and were not going to die (certainly 
everybody who was in the control 
room or in the shelter when it hap- 
pened, plus all or almost all the third- 
class passengers if they had moved 
fast), a second group so terribly 
exposed that they were certain to 
die, no matter what (let’s say every- 
body in first-class country) — and a 
third group, no telling how large, 
who had been dangerously exposed 
but could be saved by quick and 
drastic treatment. 

In which case that quick and 
drastic action would be going on. 

They would be checking our ex- 
posure meters and reshuffling us — 
sorting out the ones in danger who 
required rapid treatment, giving 
morphine shots to the ones who were 
going to die anyhow and moving 
them off by themselves, stacking 
those of us who were safe by our- 
selves to keep us from getting in the 
way, or drafting us to help nurse 
the ones who could be helped. 

That was certain. But there was 
nothing going on, nothing at all — 
just some babies crying and a mur- 
mur of voices. Why, they hadn’t even 
looked at the exposure meters of 
most of us. It seemed likely that the 
surgeon had checked only the last 
few stragglers to reach the shelter. 

Therefore the captain had told 
us the simple, heart-warming truth. 

I felt so good that I forgot to 
wonder why Mrs. Royer had looked 
like a ripe tomato. I relaxed and 
soaked in the warm and happy fact 
that darling Uncle Tom wasn’t going 
to die and that my kid brother would 
live to cause me lots more homey 



grief. I almost went to sleep — 

— and was yanked out of it by 
the woman on my right starting to 
scream: “Let me out of herel Let 
me out of here T 

Then I did see some fast and 
drastic emergency action. 

Two crewmen swarmed up to our 
shelf and grabbed her; a stewardess 
was right behind them. She slapped 
a gag over the woman’s mouth and 
gave her a shot in the arm, all in 
one motion. Then they held her 
until she stopped struggling. When 
she was quiet, one of the crewmen 
picked her up and took her some- 
where. 

Shortly thereafter a stewardess 
showed up who was collecting ex- 
posure meters and passing out sleep- 
ing pills. Most people took them but 
I resisted — I don’t like pills at best 
and I certainly won’t take one to 
knock me out so that I won’t know 
what is going on. The stewardess was 
insistent but I can be awful stub- 
born, so she shrugged and went 
away. After that there were three or 
four more cases of galloping claus- 
trophobia or maybe just plain 
screaming funk; I wouldn’t know. 
Each was taken care of promptly 
with no fuss and shortly the shelter 
was quiet except for snores, a few 
voices and fairly continuous sounds 
of babies crying. 

T ^here weren’t any babies in first 
class and not many children of 
any age. Second class has quite a few 
kids, but third class is swarming 
with them and every family seems 
to have at least one young baby. It’s 

61 




why they are there, of course. Al- 
most all of third class are Earth 
people emigrating to Venus. With 
Earth so crowded, a man with a 
big family can easily reach the point 
where emigration to Venus looks 
like the best way out of an impos- 
sible situation, so he signs a labor 
contract and Venus Corporation 
pays for their tickets as an advance 
against his wages. 

I suppose it’s all right. They need 
to get away and Venus needs all the 
people they can get. But I’m glad 
Mars Republic doesn’t subsidize im- 
migration. or we would be swamped. 
Our immigrants have to pay their 
own wav. They even have to de- 
posit return tickets with the PEG 
board, tickets they can’t cash in for 
two of our years 

A good thing, too. At least a 
third of our immigrants who come 
to Mars just can’t adjust. Thev get 
homesick and despondent and use 
those return tickets to go back to 
Earth. I can’t understand anyone’s 
not liking Mars; but if they don’t 
then it’s better if they don’t stay. 

1 lay there, thinking about such 
things, a little bit excited and a little 
bit bored, and mostly wondering why 
somebody didn’t do something about 
those poor babies. 

The lights had been dimmed and 
when somebody came up to my shelf 
I didn’t see who it was at first. 
“Poddy?” came Girdie’s voice, softly 
but clearlv. “Are you in there?” 

“I think so What's up, Girdie?” I 
tried to keep mv voice down. too. 

“Do you know how to change a 

baby?" 

62 



“I certainly do I” Suddenly I won- 
dered how Duncan was doing . 
and realized that I hadn’t really 
thought about him in days. Had he 
forgotten me? Would he know 
Grandmaw Poddy the next time he 
saw her? 

“Then come along, chum. There’s 
work to be done.” 

There certainly was. The lowest 
part of the shelter, four catwalks 
below my billet and just over the 
engineering spaces, was cut like a 
pie into four quarters — sanitary 
units, two sick bays, for men and 
for women and both crowded — and 
jammed into a little corner between 
the infirmaries was a sorry pretense 
for a nursery, not more than two 
meters in any dimension. On three 
walls of it babies were stacked high 
in canvas crib baskets snap-hooked 
to the walls, and more overflow into 
the women’s sick bay. A sweeping 
majority of those babies were crying. 

In the crowded middle of this pan- 
demonium two harrassed steward- 
esses were changing babies, working 
on a barely -big-enough shelf let 
down out of one wall. Girdie tapped 
one of them on the shoulder. “All 
right, girls, reinforcements have 
landed. So get some rest and a bite 
to eat.” 

T he older one protested feebly, 
but they were awfully glad to 
take a break. They backed out and 
Girdie and I moved in and took 
over. 

I don’t know how long we worked, 
as we didn’t have time to think about 
it — there was always more than wo 




could do and we never quite got 
caught up. But it was better than 
lying on a shelf and staring at an- 
other shelf just centimeters above 
your nose. The worst of it was that 
there simply wasn’t enough room. 
I worked with both elbows held in 
close, to keep from bumping Girdie 
on one side and a basket crib that 
was nudging me on the other side. 

But I’m not complaining about 
that. The engineer who designed 
that shelter into the Tricorn had been 
forced to plan as many people as 
possible into the smallest space; 
there wasn’t any other way to do it. 
I doubt if he worried much about 
getting babies changed and dry. He 
had enough to do just worrying 
about how to keep them alive. 

But you can’t tell that to a baby. 

Girdie worked with an easy, no- 
lost-motions efficiency that surprised 
me; I would have guessed that she 
had never had her hands on a baby. 
But she knew what she was doing 
and was faster than I was. “Where 
are their mothers?” I asked, mean- 
ing: “Why aren’t those lazy slobs 
here helping instead of leaving it to 
the stewardesses and some volun- 
teers?” 

Girdie understood me. “Most of 
them have other children to keep 
quiet. They have their hands full. 
A couple of them went to pieces 
themselves; they’re in there sleeping 
it off.” She jerked her head toward 
the sick bay. 

I shut up, as it made sense. You 
couldn’t possibly take care of an 
infant properly in one of those shal- 
low niches the passengers were stack- 




ed in — and if each mother tried to 
bring her own baby down here each 
time, the traffic jam would be inde- 
scribable. £Jo, this assembly-line 
system was necessary. I said, “We’re 
running out of Disposies.” 

“Stacked in a cupboard behind 
you. Did you see what happened to 
Mrs. Garcia’s face?” 

“Huh?” I squatted and got out 
more supplies. “You mean Mrs. Roy- 
er, don’t you?” 

“I mean both of them. But I saw 
Milady Garcia first and got a bet- 
ter look at her, while they were 
quieting her down. You didn’t see 
her?” 

“No.” 

“Sneak a look into the women’s 
ward first chance you get. Her face 
is the brightest, most amazing 
chrome yellow I’ve ever seen in a 
paint pot, much less on a human 
face.” 

I gasped. “Gracious! I did see 
Mrs. Royer — bright red instead of 
yellow. Girdie — what in the world 

63 




happened to make them that way?” 
“I’m fairly sure I know what 
happened,” Girdie answered slowly, 
“but no one can figure out how it 
happened.” 

“I don’t follow you.” 

“The colors tell the story. Those 
are the exact shades of two of the 
water-activated dyes used in pho- 
tography. Know anything about 
photography, hon?” 

“Not much,” I answered. I wasn’t 
going to admit what little I did know 
. because Clark is a very accom- 
plished photographer. And I wasn’t 
going to mention that, either! 

44T XTell, surely you’ve seen some- 
VV one taking snapshots. You 
pull out the tab and there is your 
picture — only there’s no picture as 
yet. Clear as glass. So you dip it in 
water and slosh it around for about 
thirty seconds. Still no picture. Then 
you lay it anywhere in the light and 
the picture starts to show . and 
when the colors are bright enough to 
suit you, you cover it up and let it 
finish drying in darkness, so that 
the colors won’t get too garish.” 



Girdie suppressed a chuckle. “From 
the results, I would say that they 
didn’t cover their faces in time to 
stop the process. They probably tried 
to scrub it off and made it worse.” 

I said, in a puzzled tone — and I 
was puzzled, about part of it: “I 
still don’t see how it could happen.” 

“Neither does anybody else. But 
the Surgeon has a theory. Somebody 
booby-trapped their wash cloths.” 

“Huh?” 

“Somebody in the ship must* have 
a supply of the pure dyes. That 
somebody soaked two wash cloths in 
the inactive dyes — colorless, I mean 
— and dried them carefully, all in 
total darkness. Then that same some- 
body sneaked those two prepared 
wash cloths into those two state- 
rooms and substituted them for wash 
cloths they found there on the state- 
room wash trays. That last part 
wouldn’t be hard for anyone with 
cool nerves. Service in the state- 
rooms has been pretty haphazard 
the last day or two, what with this 
flap over the radiation storm. Maybe 
a fresh wash cloth appears in your 
room, maybe it doesn’t — and all the

ship’s wash cloths and towels are 
the same pattern. You just wouldn’t 
know.” 

I certainly hope not, I said to my- 
self — and added, aloud, “I suppose 
not.” 

“Certainly not. It could be one 
of the stewardesses. Or any of the 
passengers. But the real mystery is: 
where did the dyes come from? 
The ship’s shop doesn’t carry them 
. just the rolls of prepared film 
. and the surgeon says that he 
knows enough about chemistry to be 
willing to stake his life that no one 
but a master chemist, using a spe- 
cial laboratory, could possibly separ- 
ate out pure dyes from a roll of 
film. He thinks, too, that since the 
dyes aren’t even manufactured on 
Mars, this somebody must be some- 
one who came aboard at Earth.” 
Girdie glanced at me and smiled. 
“So you’re not a suspect. Poddy. 
But I am.” 

“Why are you a suspect?” (And if 
I’m not a suspect, then my brother 
isn’t a suspect!) “Why, that’s silly!” 

“Yes, it is . because I wouldn’t 
have known how even if I’d had 
the dyes. But it isn’t . inasmuch 
as I could have bought them before 
I left Earth. And I don’t have reason 
to like either of those women.” 

“I’ve never heard you say a word 
against them.” 

“No, but they’ve said a few thous- 
and words about me — and other 
people have ears. So I’m a hot sus- 
pect, Poddy. But don’t fret about 
it. I didn’t do it, so there is no pos- 
sible way to show that I did.” She 
chuckled. “And I hope they never 



catch the somebody who did!” 

I didn’t even answer, “Me, too!” 
I could think of one person who 
might figure out a way to get pure 
dyes out of a roll of film, without 
a complete chemistry laboratory . • 
and I was checking quickly through 
my mind every item I had seen 
when I searched Clark’s room. 

There hadn’t been . anything in 
Clark’s room which could have been 
photographic dyes. No, not even 
film. 

Which proves precisely nothing 
where Clark is concerned. I just 
hope that he was careful about fin- 
gerprints. 

T wo other stewardesses came in 
presently and we fed all the ba- 
bies. Then Girdie and I managed 
a sort of wash-up and had a snack 
standing up, and then I went back 
up to my assigned shelf and sur- 
prised myself by falling asleep. 

I must have slept three or four 
hours, because I missed the happen- 
ings when Mrs. Dirkson had her 
baby. She is one of the Terran emi- 
grants to Venus and she shouldn’t 
have had her baby until long after 
we reach Venus. I suppose the ex- 
citement stirred things up. Anyhow, 
when she started to groan, they car- 
ried her down to that dinky infirm- 
ary and Dr. Torland took one look 
at her and ordered her carried 
up into the control room — because 
the control room was the only place 
inside the radiation-safe space roomy 
enough to let him do what needed 
to be done. 

So that’s where the baby was bom, 

40 




on the deck of the control room, 
right between the chart tank and 
the computer. Dr. Torland and Cap- 
tain Darling are godfathers and the 
senior stewardess is godmother and 
the baby’s name is “Radiant,” which 
is a poor pun but rather pretty. 

They jury-rigged an incubator for 
Radiant right there in the control 
room before they moved Mrs. Dirk- 
son back to the infirmary and gave 
her something to make her sleep. 
The baby was still there when I 
woke up and heard about it. 

I decided to take a chance that 
the captain was feeling more mellow 
now, and sneaked up to the control 
room and stuck my head in. “Could 
I please see the baby?” 

The captain looked annoyed, then 
he barely smiled and said, “All right, 
Poddy. Take a quick look and get 
out.” 

So I did. Radiant masses about a 
kilo and. frankly, she looks like 
cat meat, not worth saving. But Dr. 
Torland says that she is doing well 
and that she will grow up to be a 
fine, healthy girl — prettier than I 
am. I suppose he knows what he is 
talking about, but if she is ever 
going to be prettier than I am, she 
has lots of kilometers to go. She is 
almost the color of Mrs. Royer and 
she’s mostly wrinkles. 

But no doubt shell outgrow it, 
because she looks like one of the 
pictures toward the end of the series 
in a rather goody-goody school book 
called The Miracle of Life. The ear- 
lier pictures, in that series were even 
less appetizing. It is probably just 
as well that we can’t possibly see 



babies until they are ready to 
make their debut, or the human 
race would lose interest and die 
It would probably be still bet- 
ter to lay eggs. Human engineering 
isn’t all that it might be, especially 
for us female types. 

I went back down where the more 
mature babies were to see if they 
needed me. They didn’t, not right 
then, as the babies had been fed 
again and a stewardess ahd a young 
woman I had never met were on 
duty and claimed that they had been 
working only a few minutes. I hung 
around anyhow, rather than go back 
up to my shelf. Soon I was pretend- 
ing to be useful by reaching past 
the two who really were working 
and checking the babies, then hand- 
ing down the ones who needed serv- 
icing as quickly as shelf space was 
cleared. 

It speeded things up a little. Pres- 
ently I pulled a little wiggler out of 
his basket and was cuddling him. 
The stewardess looked up and said, 
“I’m ready for him.” 

“Oh, he’s not wet,” I answered. 
“Or ‘she’ as the case may be. Just 
lonely and needs loving.” 

“We haven’t time for that.” 

“I wonder.” The worst thing about 
that midget nursery was the high 
noise level. The babies woke each 
other and egged each other on and 
the decibels were something fierce. 
No doubt they were all lonely and 
probably frightened — I’m sure I 
would be. “Most of these babies need 
loving more than they need anything 
else.” 



66 




“They’ve all had their bottles.” 

“A bottle can’t cuddle.” 

She didn’t answer, but just started 
checking the other infants. But I 
didn’t think what I had said was 
silly. A baby can’t understand your 
words and he doesn’t know where 
he is if you put him in a strange 
place, nor what has happened. So 
he cries. Then he needs to be 
soothed. 

Girdie showed up just then. “Can 
I help?” 

“You certainly can. Here . hold 
this one.” 

In a few minutes I rounded up 
three girls about my age and I ran 
across Clark prowling around the 
catwalks instead of staying quietly 
in his assigned billet so I drafted 
him, too. He wasn’t exactly eager to 
volunteer. But doing anything was 
slightly better than doing nothing; 
he came along. 

I couldn’t use any more help as 
standing room was almost non-exis- 
tent. We worked it only by having 
two baby-cuddlers sort of back into 
each of the infirmaries, with the 
mistress of ceremonies (me) stand- 
ing in the little space at the bottom 
of the ladder, ready to scrunch in 
any direction to let people get in 
and out of, the washrooms and up 
and down the ladder — and with Gir- 
die, because she was tallest, standing 
back of the two at the changing 
shelf and dealing out babies, the 
loudest back to me for further assign- 
ment and the wet ones down for 
service — and vice versa; dry ones 
back to their baskets unless they 
started to yell, ones that had fallen 



asleep from being held and cuddled 
likewise. 

At least seven babies could re- 
ceive personal attention at once, and 
sometimes as high as ten or eleven, 
because at one-tenth gee your feet 
never get tired and a baby doesn’t 
weigh anything at all worth mention- 
ing; it was possible to hold one in 
each arm and sometimes we did. 

In ten minutes we had that racket 
quieted down to an occasional whim- 
per, quickly soothed. I didn’t think 
Clark would stick it out, but he did 
— probably because Girdie was part 
of the team. With a look of grim 
nobility on his face the like of which 
I have never before seen there he 
cuddled babies and presently was 
saying, “Kitchy-koo,kitchy-koo!” and 
“TTiere, there, honey bun,” as if 
he had been doing it all his life. 
Furthermore, the babies seemed to 
like him. He could soothe one down 
quickest of any of us. 

T tois went on for several hours, 
with volunteers moving in and 
tired ones moving out and positions 
rotating. I was relieved once and 
had another snatched meal and then 
stretched out on my shelf for about 
an hour before going back to duty. 

I was back at the changing shelf 
when the captain called us all by 
speaker: “Attention, please. In five 
minutes power will be cut and the 
ship will be in free fall while a re- 
pair is made outside the ship. All 
passengers strap down. All crew 
members observe precautions for 
free fall.” 

I went right on changing the 

67 




baby under my hands; you can’t 
walk off on a baby. In the meantime 
babies that had been being cuddled 
were handed back and stowed, and 
the cuddling team was chased back 
to their shelves to strap down and 
spin was being taken off the ship. 
One rotation every twelve seconds 
you simply don’t notice at the center 
of the ship — but you do notice when 
the unspinning starts. The stewardess 
with me on the changing bench said, 
“Poddy, go up and strap down. 
Hurry.” 

I said, “Don’t be silly, Bergitta, 
there’s work to be done,” and pop- 
ped the baby I had just dried into 
its basket and fastened the zipper. 

“You’re a passenger. That’s an 
order — please /” 

“Who’s going to check all these 
babies? You? And how about those 
four in on the floor of the women’s 
sick bay?” 

Bergitta looked startled and hur- 
ried to fetch them. All the other 
stewardesses were busy checking on 
strap-down; she didn’t bother me any 
more with That’s-an-order; she was 
too busy hooking up the changing 
shelf and fastening baby baskets to 
the space. I was checking all the 
others and almost all of them had 
been left unzipped — logical enough 
while we were working with them, 
but zipping the cover on a baby 
basket is the ‘same as strapping down 
for a grown-up. It holds them firmly 
but comfortably with just their heads 
free. 

1 still hadn’t finished when the 
siren sounded and the captain cut 
the power. 



Oh, brother! Pandemonium. The 
siren woke the babies who were 
asleep and scared any who were 
awake and every single one of those 
squirmy little worms started to cry 
at the top of its lungs . and one 
I hadn’t zipped yet popped right out 
of its basket and floated right into the 
middle of space and I snagged it by 
one leg and was loose myself and 
the baby and I bumped gently 
against the baskets on one wall — 
only it wasn’t a wall any longer, it 
was just an obstacle to further 
progress. Free fall can be very con- 
fusing when you are not used to it, 
which I admit I am not. Or wasn’t. 

The stewardess grabbed us both. 
She shoved the elusive little darling 
back into her straightjacket and 
zipped it while I hung onto a hand 
hold. And by then two more were 
loose. 

I did better this time. I snagged 
one without letting go and just kept 
it captive while Bergitta took care 
of the other one. Bergitta really 
knew how to handle herself in zero 
gravity, with unabrupt graceful 
movements like a dancer in a slow- 
motion solly. I made a mental note 
that this was a skill I must acquire. 

I thought the emergency was over. 
I was wrong. 

Babies don’t like free fall; it 
frightens them. It also makes their 
sphincters most erratic. Most of the 
latter we could ignore — but Dis- 
poses don’t catch everything; re- 
grettably some six or seven of them 
had been fed in the last hour. 

I know now why stewardesses are 



68 




all graduate nurses. We kept five 
babies from choking to death in the 
next few minutes. That is, Bergitta 
cleared the throat of the first one 
that up-chucked its milk and, seeing 
what she had done, I worked on the 
second one in trouble while she 
grabbed the third. And so on. 

Then we were very busy trying 
to clear the air with clean Disposies 
because — listen, dear, if you think 
you’ve had it tough because your 
baby brother threw up all over your 
new party dress, then you should try 
free fall, where it doesn’t settle any- 
where in particular but just floats 
around like smoke until you either 
get it or it gets you. 

From six babies. In a small com- 
partment. 

By the time we had the mess 
cleaned up, or 95 % so, anyway, 
we were both mostly sour milk from 
hair part to ankle and the captain 
was warning us to stand by for ac- 
celeration, which came almost at 
once to my great relief. 




The chief stewardess showed up 
and was horrified that 1 had not 
strapped down. I told her in a lady- 
like way to go to hell, using a more 
polite idiom suitable to my age and 
sex — and asked her what Captain 
Darling would think about a baby 
passenger choking to death simply 
because I had strapped dojvn all reg- 
ulation-like and according to orders? 
And Bergitta backed me up and told 
her that I had cleared choke from 
at least two and maybe more — she 
had been too busy to count. 

Mrs. Peal, the C.S., changed her 
tune in a hurry and was sorry and 
thanked me. She sighed and wiped 
her forehead and trembled and you 
could see that she was dead on her 
feet. But nevertheless she checked all 
the babies herself and hurried out. 
Pretty quickly we were relieved. Ber- 
gitta and I crowded into the wom- 
en’s washroom and tried to clean up 
some — not much good as we didn’t 
have any clean clothes to change 
into. 

The “All Clear” felt like a re- 
prieve from purgatory. A hot bath 
was heaven itself, with the angels 
singing. “A” deck had already been 
checked for radiation level and pro- 
nounced safe while the repair out- 
side the ship was being made. The 
repair itself, I learned, was routine. 
Some of the antennas and receptors 
and things outside the ship can’t take 
a flare storm. They burn out, so im- 
mediately after a storm men go out- 
side in armored space suits and re- 
place them. This is normal and un- 
avoidable, like replacing lighting 
tubes at home. But the men who do

it get the same radiation bonus that 
the passenger chasers get — because 
Old Sol could burn them down with 
one tiny little afterthought. 

I soaked in warm, clean water and 
thought how miserable an eighteen 
hours it had been. Then I decided 
that it hadn’t been so bad after all. 

It’s lots better to be miserable 
than to be bored. 

IX 

I am now twenty-seven years old. 

Venus years, of course, but it 
sounds so much better. All is rela- 
tive. 

Not that I would stay here on Ve- 
nus even if guaranteed the Perfect 
Age for a thousand years. Venus- 
berg is sort of an organized nervous 
breakdown and the country outside 
the city is even worse. What little 
I’ve seen of it. And I don’t want to 
see much of it. Why they ever nam- 
ed this dreary, smog-ridden place 
for the Goddess of Love and Beauty 
I’ll never know. This planet appears 
to have been put together from the 
scrap left over after the rest of the 
Solar System was finished. 

70 



I don’t think I would go outside 
Venusberg at all except that I’ve 
just got to see fairies in flight. The 
only one I’ve seen so far is in the 
lobby of the hilton we are staying in 
and is stuffed. 

Actually I’m just marking time 
until we shape for Earth, because 
Venus is a Grave Disappointment. 
Now I’m keeping my fingers crossed 
that Earth will not be a G.D., too. 
But I don’t see how it can be. There 
is something deliciously primitive 
about the very thought of a planet 
where one can go outdoors without 
any special preparations. Why, 
Uncle Tom tells me that there are 
places along the Mediterranean 
(that’s an ocean in La Belle France) 
where the natives bathe in the ocean 
itself without any clothing of any 
sort at all, much less insulasuits or 
masks. 

I wouldn’t like that. Not that I’m 
body proud; I enjoy a good sauna 
sweat-out as well as the next Mars- 
man. But it would scare me cross- 
eyed to bathe in an ocean. I don’t 
ever intend to get wet all over in 
anything larger than a bath tub. I 




saw a man fished out of the Grand 
Canal once, in early spring. They 
had to thaw him before they could 
cremate him. 

But it is alleged that, along the 
Mediterranean shore, the air in the 
summer time is often blood temper- 
ature and the water not much cooler. 
As may be. Podkayne is not going 
to take any silly chances. 

Nevertheless I am terribly eager 
to see Earth, in all its fantastic un- 
likeliness. It occurs to me that my 
most vivid conceptions of Earth 
come from the Oz stories. When 
you come right down to it I suppose 
that isn’t too reliable a source. I 
mean, Dorothy’s conversations with 
the Wizard are instructive — but 
about what? When I was a child I 
believed every word of my Oz tapes 
. but now I am no longer a child 
and I do not truly suppose that a 
whirlwind is a reliable means of 
transportation, nor that one is likely 
to encounter a Tin Woodman on a 
road of yellow brick. 

Tik-Tok, yes — because we really 
do have Tik-Toks in Marsopolis for 
the simpler and more tedious work. 
Not precisely like Tik-Tok of Oz, 
of course, and not called “Tik-Toks” 
by anyone but children . but 
near enough, near enough, quite 
sufficient to show that the Oz stories 
are founded on fact, if not precisely 
historical. 

And I believe in the Hungry Ti- 
ger, too, in the most practical way 
possible, because there was one in 
the municipal zoo when I was a 
child, a gift from the Calcutta Ki- 
wanis Klub to Marsopolis Kiwan- 



ians. It always looked at me as if it 
were sizing me up as an appetizer. 
It died when I was about five. I 
didn’t know whether to be sorry or 
glad. It was so beautiful . and 
so very Hungry. 

But Earth is still many weeks 
away and, in the meantime, Venus 
does have some points of interests 
for the newcomer, such as I. 

I n traveling 1 strongly recommend 
traveling with my Uncle Tom. 
On arriving here there were no sil- 
ly waits in “Hospitality” (!) rooms; 
we were given the “courtesy of the 
port” at once — to the extreme # 
chagrin of Mrs. Royer. “Courtesy of 
the port” means that your baggage 
isn’t examined and that nobody bo- 
thers to look at that bulky mass of 
documents — passport and health 
record and security clearance and 
solvency proof and birth certificate 
and I.D.s and nineteen other silly 
forms. Instead we were whisked 
from satellite station to space port 
in the private yacht of the Chairman 
of the Board and were met there by 
the chairman himself! — and pop- 
ped into his Rolls and wafted royal- 
ly to Hilton Tannhauser. 

We were invited to stay at his 
official residence (his “cottage,” 
that being the Venus word for a 
palace) but I don’t think he really 
expected us to accept because Uncle 
Tom just cocked his left or satirical 
eyebrow and, “Mr. Chairman, I 
don’t think you would want me to 
appear to be bribed even if you 
manage,” he said. 

And the chairman didn’t seem 

71 




offended at all He just chuckled till 
his belly shook like Saint Nicholas 
(whom he strongly resembles even 
to the beard and the red cheeks al- 
though his eyes are cold even when 
he laughs, which is frequently.) 

“Senator,” he said, “you know me 
better than that. My attempt to bribe 
you will be much more subtle. Per- 
haps through this young lady. Miss 
Podkayne, are you fond of jewelry?” 
I told him honestly that I wasn’t, 
very, because I always lose it. So 
he blinked and said to Clark, “How 
about you, son?” 

Clark said, “I prefer cash.” 

The chairman blinked again and 
said nothing. 

Nor had he said anything to his 
driver when Uncle Tom declined the 
offer of his roof; nevertheless we 
flew straight to our hilton — which 
is why 1 don’t think he ever expected 
us to stay with him. 

But I am beginning to realize that 
this is not entirely a pleasure trip 
for Uncle Tom . and to grasp 
emotionally a fact known only intel- 
lectually in the past, i.e., Uncle Tom 
is not merely the best pinochle play- 
er in Marsopolis, he sometimes plays 
other games for higher stakes. I 
must confess that the what or why 
ties outside my admittedly youthful 
horizon — save that everyone knows 
that the Three-Planets Conference 
is coming up 

Query: Could U.T. conceivably 
be involved in this? As a consultant 
or something? I hope not. as it 
might keep him tied up for weeks 
on Luna. 1 have no wish to waste 
time on a dreary ball of slag while 



the Wonders of Terra await me — 
and Uncle Tom just might be diffi- 
cult about letting me go down to 
Earth without him. 

But I wish still more strongly that 
Clark had not answered the chair- 
man truthfully. 

Still, Clark would not sell out his 
own uncle for more money. 

On the other hand, Clark does not 
regard money as “mere.” I must 
think about this — 

But it is some comfort to realize 
that anyone who handed Clark a 
bribe would find that Clark had not 
only taken the bribe but the hand. 

P ossibly our suite at the Tannhau- 
ser is intended as a bribe, too. 
Are we paying for it? I’m almost 
afraid to ask Uncle Tom, but I do 
know this: the servants that come 
with it won’t accept tips. Not any. 
Although I very carefully studied 
up on the subject of tipping, both 
for Venus and Earth, so that I would 
know what to do when the time 
came — and it had been my under- 
standing that anyone on Venus al- 
ways accepts tips, even ushers in 
churches and bank tellers. 

But not the servants assigned to 
us. I have two tiny little amber dolls, 
identical twins, who shadow me and 
would bathe me if 1 would let them. 
They speak Portuguese but not Or- 
tho — and at present mv Portuguese 
is limited to “Gobble-Gobble” 
(which means “Thank you”) and I 
have trouble explaining to them that 
I can dress and undress myself and 
I’m not too sure about their names. 
They both answer to “Maria.” 



72 




Or at least I don’t think they 
speak Ortho. I must think about 
this, too. 

Venus is officially bilingual, Or- 
tho and Portuguese, but I’ll bet I 
heard at least twenty other languages 
the first hour we were down. German 
sounds like a man being choked to 
death, French sounds like a cat 
fight, while Spanish sounds like mo- 
lasses gurgling gently out of a jug. 
Cantonese — Well, think of a man 
trying to vocalize Bach who doesn’t 
like Bach very much to start with. 

Fortunately almost everybody 
understands Ortho as well. Except 
Maria and Maria. If true. 

I could live a long time without 
the luxury of personal maids but I 
must admit that this hilton suite is 
quite a treat to a plain-living whole- 
some Mars girl, namelv me. Especi- 
ally as I am in it quite a lot of the 
time and will be for a while vet. The 
ship’s surgeon. Dr. Torland, gave 
me many of the special inoculations 
needed for Venus on the trip here 
— an unpleasant subject I chose not 
to mention — but there still remain 
many more before it will be safe for 
me to go outside the city, or even 
very much into the city. As soon as 
we reached our suite a phvsician 
appeared and played chess on my 
back with scratches, red to move and 
mate in fiye moves. Three hours 
later 1 had several tens of welts, 
with something horrid that must be 
done about each of them 

Clark ducked out and didn’t get 
his scratch tests until the next morn- 
ing. I misdoubt he will die of Purple 
Itch or some such, were it not that 



his karma is so clearly reserving him 
for hanging. Uncle Tom refused the 
tests. He was through all this rou- 
tine more than twenty years ago and 
anyhow he claims that the too, too 
mortal flesh is merely a figment of 
the imagination. 

So I am more or less limited for a 
few days to lavish living here in the 
Tannhauser. If I go out I must wear 
gloves and a mask even in the city. 
But one whole wall of the suite’s 
salon becomes a stereo stage simply 
by voice request, either taped or 
piped live from any theater or club 
in Venusberg — and some of the 
“entertainment” has widened my 
sophistication unbelievably, especial- 
ly when Uncle Tom is not around. 
I am beginning to realize that Mars 
is an essentially puritanical culture. 
Of course Venus doesn’t actually 
have laws, just company regulations, 
none of which seem to be concerned 
with personal conduct. But I had 
been brought up to believe that 
Mars Republic is a free society. I 
suppose it is. However, there is 
“freedom” and “freedom.” 

H ere the Venus Corporation owns 
everything worth owning and 
runs everything that shows a profit, 
all in a fashion that would make 
Marsmen swoon. But I guess Venus- 
men would swoon at how straitlaced 
we are. I know this Mars girl blush- 
ed for the first time in I don’t know 
when and switched off a show that 
I didn’t really believe. 

But the solly screen is far from 
being the only astonishing feature 
of this suite. It is so big that one 



?4 




should carry food and water when 
exploring it and the salon is so huge 
that local storms appear distinctly 
possible. My private bath is a suite 
in itself, with so many gadgets in it 
that I ought to have an advanced de- 
gree in engineering before risking 
washing my hands. But I’ve learned 
how to use them all and purely love 
them! I had never dreamed that I 
had been limping along all my life 
without Utter Necessities. 

Up to now my top ambition along 
these lines has been not to have to 
share a wash stand with Clark be- 
cause it has never been safe to reach 
for my own Christmas-present co- 
logne without checking to see that 
it is not nitric acid or worse. Clark 
regards a bathroom as an auxiliary 
chemistry lab; he’s not much inter- 
ested in staying clean. 

But the most astonishing thing in 
our suite is the piano. No, no, dear, 
I don’t mean a keyboard hooked 
into the sound system; I mean a real 
piano. Three legs. Made out of 
wood. Enormous. That odd awk- 
ward-graceful curved shape that 
doesn’t fit anything else and can’t 
be put in a corner. A top that opens 
up and lets you see that it really 
does have a harp inside and very 
complex machinery for making it 
work. 

I think that there are just four 
real pianos on all of Mars, the one 
in the Museum that nobody plays 
and probably doesn’t work, the one 
in Lowell Academy that no longer 
has a harp inside it, just wiring con- 
nections that make it really the same 
as any other piano, the one in the 



Rose House (as if any President ever 
had time to play a piano!), and the 
one in the Beaux Arts Hall that ac- 
tually is played sometimes by visiting 
artists although I’ve never heard it. 
I don’t think there can be another 
one, or it would have been banner- 
lined in the news, wouldn’t you 
think? * 

This one was made by a man 
named Steinway and it must have 
taken him a lifetime. I played Chop- 
sticks on it (that being the best opus 
in my limited repertoire) until 
Uncle asked me to stop. Then I 
closed it up, keyboard and top, be- 
cause I had seen Clark eyeing the 
machinery inside, and warned him 
sweetly but firmly that if he touched 
one finger to it I would break all 
his fingers while he was asleep. He 
wasn’t listening but he knows I mean 
it. That piano is Sacred to the Mus- 
es and is not to be taken apart by 
our Young Archimedes. 

I don’t care what the electronics 
engineers say. There is a vast dif- 
ference between a “piano” and a 
real piano. No matter if their silly 
oscilloscopes “prove” that the sound 
is identical. It is like the difference 
between being warmly clothed— or 
climbing up in your Daddy’s lap and 
getting really warm. 

I haven’t been under house arrest 
all the time. I’ve been to the ca- 
sinos, with Girdie and with Dexter 
Cunha, Dexter being the son of Mr. 
Chairman of the Board Kurt Cunha. 
Girdie is leaving us here, going to 
stay on Venus, and it makes me sad. 

I asked her, “Why?” 



75 




We were sitting alone in our pa- 
latial salon Girdie is staying in this 
same hilton, in a room not very dif- 
ferent nor much larger than her 
cabin in the Tricorn. I guess I’m 
just mean enough that I wanted her 
to see the swank we were enjoying. 
But my excuse was to have her help 
me dress. For now I am wearing 
(Shudder?) support garments. Arch 
supports in my shoes and tight 
things here and here intended to 
keep me from spreading out like an 
amoeba. I won’t say what Clark calls 
them because Clark is rude, crude, 
unrefined, and barbaric. 

I hate them. But, at 84% of one 
standard gee I need them despite all 
that exercise I took aboard ship. 
This alone is reason enough not to 
live on Venus, or on Earth, even if 
they were as delightful as Mars. 

Girdie did help me — she had 
bought them for me in the first place 
— but she also made me change my 
makeup, one which I had most 
carefully copied out of the latest is- 
sue of Aphrodite. She looked at me 
and said, “Go wash your face. Pod- 
dv Then we’ll start over.” 

1 pouted out my lip and said, 
“Won’t?” The one thing I had noticed 
most and quickest was that every 
female on Venus wears paint like a 
Red Indian shooting at the Good 
Guys in the sollies. Even Maria and 
Maria wear three times as much 
makeup just to work in as Mother 
wears to a formal reception — and 
Mother doesn’t wear any when 
working. 

“Poddy, Poddy? Be a good girl.” 

“1 am being a good girl. It’s po- 

76 



lite to do things the way the local 
people do them, I learned that when 
I was just a child. And look at your- 
self in the mirror?” Girdie was 
wearing as high-styled a Venusberg 
face-do as any in that magazine. 

“I know what I look like. But I 
am more than twice your age and no 
one even suspects me of being young 
and sweet and innocent. Always be 
what you are, Poddy. Never pretend. 
Look at Mrs. Grew. She’s a comfort- 
able fat old woman. She isn’t kit- 
tenish, she’s just nice to be around.” 

“You want me to look like a hick 
tourist?” 

“I want you to look like Poddy. 
Come, dear, we’ll find a happy me- 
dium. I grant you that even the girls 
your age here wear more makeup 
than grown-up women do on Mars 

— so we’ll compromise Instead of 
painting you like a Venusberg trol- 
lop, we’ll make you a young lady 
of good family and gentle breeding, 
one who is widely traveled and used 
to all sorts of customs and manners 

— and so calmly sure of herself that 
she knows what is best for her . , 
totally uninfluenced by local fads.” 

Girdie is an artist, I must admit. 
She started with a blank canvas and 
worked on me for more than an 
hour When she got through, you 
couldn’t see that I was wearing any 
makeup at all. 

B ut here is what you could see: I 
was at least two years older 
(real years. Mars years, or about six 
Venus years); my face was thinner 
and my nose not pug at all and I 
looked ever so slightly world-weary 




in a sweet and tolerant way. My eyes 
were enormous. 

“Satisfied?” she asked. 

“I’m beautiful !” 

“Yes, you are. Because you are 
still Poddy. All I’ve done is make a 
picture of Poddy the way she is go- 
ing to be. Before long.” 

My eyes filled with tears and we 
had to blot them up very hastily and 
she repaired the damage. “Now,” 
she said briskly, “all we need is a 
club. And your mask.” 

“What’s the club for? And I won’t 
wear a mask, not on top of this.” 
“The club is to beat off wealthy 
stockholders who will throw them- 
selves at your feet. And you will 
wear your mask, or else we won’t 

go” 

We compromised. I wore the 
mask until we got there and Girdie 
promised to repair any damage to 
my face — and promised that she 
would coach me as many times as 
necessary until I could put on that 
lovely, lying face myself. The casi- 
nos are safe, or supposed to be. The 
air is not merely filtered and condi- 
tioned but freshly regenerated, free 
of any trace of pollen, virus, colloi- 
dal suspension or whatever. This 
is because lots of tourists don’t like 
to take all the long list of immuniza- 
tions necessary actually to live on 
Venus . but the Corporation 
wouldn’t think of letting a tourist 
get away unbled. So the hiltons are 
safe and the casinos are safe and a 
tourist can buy a health insurance 
policy from the Corporation for a 
very modest premium. Then he finds 
that he can cash his policy back in 



for gambling chips any time he 
wants to. I understand that the Cor- 
poration hasn’t had to pay off on 
one of those policies very often. 

Venusberg assaults the eye and 
ear even from inside a taxi. I believe 
in free enterprise; all Marsmen do, 
it’s an article of faith and the main 
reason we won't federate with Earth 
(and be outvoted five hundred to 
one). But free enterprise is not 
enough excuse to blare in your ears 
and glare in your eyes every time 
you leave your own roof. The shops 
never close (I don’t think anything 
ever closes, in Venusberg) and full 
color and stereo ads climb right in- 
side your taxi and sit in your lap 
and shout in your ear. 

Don’t ask me how this horrid il- 
lusion is produced. The engineer 
who invented it probably flew off on 
his own broom. This red devil about 
a meter high appeared between us 
and the partition separating us from 
the driver (there wasn’t a sign of 
a solly receiver) and started jabbing 
at us with a pitchfork. “Get the Hi- 
Ho Habit!” it shrieked. “Everybody 
drinks Hi-Ho! Soothing, Habit-Form- 
ing, T)ee-lishus! Get High with Hi- 
Ho!” 

I shrank back against the cushions. 

Girdie phoned the driver. “Please 
shut that thing off.” 

It faded down to just a pink ghost 
and the commercial dropped to a 
whisper while the driver answered, 
“Can’t, Madam. They rent the con- 
cession.” Devil and noise came back 
on full blast. 

And I learned something about 
tipping. Girdie took money from 

77 




her purse, displaying one note. No- 
thing happened and she added a sec- 
ond; noise and image faded down 
again. She passed them through a 
slot to the driver and we weren’t 
bothered any more. Oh, the trans- 
parent ghost of the red devil re- 
mained and a nagging whisper of his 
voice, until both were replaced by 
another ad just as faint — but we 
could talk. The giant ads in the 
street outside were noisier and more 
dazzling; I didn’t see how the driver 
could see or hear to drive, especial- 
ly as traffic was unbelievably thick 
and heart-stoppingly fast and frantic 
and our driver kept cutting in and 
out of lanes and up and down in 
levels as if he were trying utmostly 
to beat Death to a hospital. 

By the time we slammed to a stop 
on the roof of Dom Pedro Casino I 
figure Death wasn’t more than a 
half a lap behind. 

I learned later why they drive like 
that. The hackie is an employe of 
the Corporation, like most every- 
body — but he is an “enterprise-em- 
ploye,” not on wages. Each day he 
has to take in a certain amount in 
fares to “make his nut” — the cor- 
poration gets all of this. After he 
has rolled up that fixed number of 
paid kilometers, he splits the take 
with the Cprporation on all other 
fares the rest of the day. So he drives 
like ipad to pay off the nut as fast as 
possible and start making some 
money himself. Then he keeps on 
driving fast because he’s got to get 
his while the getting is good. 

Uncle Tom says that most people 



on Earth have much the same deal, 
except it’s done by the year and they 
call it income tax. 

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan 
A stately pleasure dome decree — 
Dom Pedro Casino is like that. 
Lavish. Beautiful. Exotic. The arch 
over the entrance proclaims EVERY 
DIVERSION IN THE KNOWN 
UNIVERSE and from what I hear 
this may well be true. However, all 
Girdie and I visited were the gam- 
ing rooms. 

I never saw so much money in 
my whole life! 

A sign outside the gambling sec- 
tor read: 

HELLO, SUCKER! 

All Games Are Honest 
All Games Have A House Percen- 
tage 

YOU CAN’T WIN\ 

So Come On In and Have Fun — • 
(While We Prove It) 

Checks Accepted. All Credit 
Cards Honored. Free Breakfast 
and a Ride to your Hilton when 
You Go Broke. Your Host, 
Dom Pedro 

I said, “Girdie, there really is 
somebody named Dom Pedro?” 

She shrugged. “He’s an employe 
and that’s not his real name. But 
he does look like an emperor. I’ll 
point him out. You can meet him if 
you like and he’ll kiss your hand. 
If you like that sort of thing. Come 
on.” 

She headed for the roulette tables 
while I tried to see everything at 
once. It was like being on the inside 



78 




of a kaleidoscope. People beautiful- 
ly dressed (employes mostly, people 
dressed every sort of way, from for- 
mal evening wear to sports shorts 
(tourists mostly), bright lights, stac- 
cato music, click and tinkle and 
shuffle and snap, rich hangings, 
armed guards in comic opera uni- 
forms, trays of drinks and food, ner- 
vous excitement, and money — 

I stopped suddenly, so Girdie 
stopped. My brother Clark. Seated 
at a crescent-shaped table at which 
a beautiful lady was dealing cards. 
In front of him several tall stacks 
of chips and an imposing pile of 
paper money. 

I should not have been startled. If 
you think that a six-year-old boy 
(or eighteen-year-old if you use their 



years) wouldn’t be allowed to gam- 
ble in Venusberg, then you haven’t 
been to Venus. Never mind what 
we do in Marsopolis, here there are 
just two requirements to gamble: 
(a) you have to be alive; (b) you 
have to have money. You don’t 
have to be able to talk Portuguese 
nor Ortho, nor any known language. 
As long as you can nod, wink, grunt 
or flip a tendril, they’ll take your 
bet. 

And your shirt. 

No, I shouldn’t have been sur- 
prised. Clark heads straight for mon- 
ey the way ions head for an elec- 
trode. Now I knew where he had 
ducked out to the first night and 
where he had been most of the time 
since. 

I went up and tapped him on the 




shoulder. He didn’t look around at 
once but a man popped up out of 
the rug like a genie from a lamp and 
had me by the arm. Clark said to 
the dealer, “Hit me,” and looked 
around. “Hi, Sis. It’s all right, Joe, 
she’s my sister.” 

“Okay?” the man said doubtfully, 
still holding my arm. 

“Sure, sure. She’s harmless. Sis, 
this is Josie Mendoza, company cop, 
on lease to me for tonight. Hi, Gir- 
die!” Clark’s voice was suddenly en- 
thusiastic. But he remembered to 
say, “Joe, slip into my seat and 
watch the stuff. Girdie, this is swell! 
You gonna play blackjack? You can 
have my seat.” 

(It must be love, dears. Or a high 
fever.) 

She explained that she was about 
to play roulette. “Want me to come 
help?” he said eagerly. “I’m pretty 
good on the wheel, too.” 

She explained to him gently that 
she did not want help because she 
was working on a system, and prom- 
ised to see him later in the evening. 
Girdie is unbelievably patient with 
Clark. I would have — 

Come to think of it, she’s unbe- 
lievably patient with me. 

If Girdie has a system for rou- 
lette, it didn’t show. We found two 
stools together and she tried to give 
me a few chips. I didn’t want to 
gamble and told her so, and she ex- 
plained that I would have to stand 
up *if I didn’t. Considering what 
84% gee does to my poor feet I 
bought a few chips of my own and 
did just what she did, which was to 
place minimum bets on the colors, 

80 



or on odd or even. This way you 
don’t win, you don’t lose — except 
that once in a long while the little 
ball lands on zero and you lose a 
chip permanently (that “house per- 
centage” the sign warned against). 

The croupier could see what we 
were doing but we actually were 
gambling and inside the rules. He 
didn’t object. I discovered almost at 
once that the trays of food circula- 
ting and the drinks were absolutely 
free — to anyone who was gam- 
bling. Girdie had a glass of wine. I 
don’t touch alcoholic drinks even on 

birthdays and I certainly wasn’t 

going to drink Hi-Ho, after that ob- 
noxious ad — but I ate two or three 
sandwiches, and asked for and got 
— they had to go get it — a glass 
of milk. I tipped the amount I saw 
Girdie tip. 

W e had been there over an 
hour and I was maybe three 
or four chips ahead when I happen- 
ed to sit up straight — and knocked 
a glass out of the hand of a man 
standing behind me, all over him, 
some over me. 

“Oh, dear!” I said, jumping down 
from my stool and trying to dab off 
the wet spots on him with my ker- 
chief. “I’m terribly sorry!” 

He bowed. “No harm done to me. 
Merely soda water. But I fear my 
clumsiness has ruined milady’s 
gown.” 

Out of one corner of her mouth 
Girdie said, “Watch it, kid!” but 
I answered, “This dress? Huh-uh! 
If that was just water, there won’t 
be a wrinkle or a spot in ten min- 




ute. Nothing but travel clothes.” 

“You are a visitor to our city? 
Then permit me to introduce my- 
self less informally than by soaking 
you to the skin.” He whipped out a 
card. Girdie was looking grim but 
I rather liked his looks. He was ac- 
tually not impossibly older than I 
am (I guessed at twelve Mars years, 
or say thirty-six of his own — and 
it turned out he was only thirty- 
two), dressed in the very elegant 
Venus evening wear, with cape and 
stick and formal ruff . and the 
cutest little waxed moustaches. 

The card read: 



Dexter Kurt Cunha, Stk. 



I read it, then reread it, then 
said, “Dexter Kurt Cunha. Are you 
any relation to — ” 

“My father.” 

“Why, I know your father!” 
— and put out my hand. 

Ever had your hand kissed? It 
makes chill bumps that race up your 
arm across your shoulders and down 
the other arm — and of course no- 
body would ever do it on Mars. This 
is a distinct shortcoming in our 
planet and one I intend to correct, 
even if I have to bribe Clark to in- 
stitute the custom. 

By the time we had names straight 
Dexter was urging us to share a 
bite of supper and some dancing 
with him in the roof garden. But 
Girdie was balky. “Mr. Cunha,” 
she said, “that is a very handsome 
calling card. But I am responsible 
for Podkayne to her uncle, and I 
would rather see your I.D.” 



For a split second he looked chilly. 
Then he smiled warmly at her and 
said, “I can do better,” and held up 
one hand. 

T l he most imposing old gentleman 
I have ever seen hurried over. 
From the medals on his chest I 
would say that he had wop every 
spelling contest from first grade on. 
His bearing was kingly and his cos- 
tume unbelievable. “Yes, Stock- 
holder?” 

“Dorn Pedro, will you please 
identify me to these ladies?” 

“With pleasure, sir.” So Dexter 
was really Dexter and I got my 
hand kissed again. Dom Pedro does 
it with a great flourish but it didn’t 
have quite the same effect. I don’t 
think he puts his heart into it the 
way Dexter does. 

Girdie insisted on stopping to 
collect Clark — and Clark suffered an 
awful moment of spontaneous schiz- 
ophrenia, for he was still winning. 
But love won out and Girdie went 
up on Clark’s arm, with Josie trail- 
ing us with the loot. I must say 
I admire my brother in some ways. 
Spending cash money to protect his 
winnings must have caused even 
deeper conflict in his soul, if any, 
than leaving the game while he was 
winning. 

The roof garden is the Brasilia 
Room and is even more magnificent 
than the casino proper, with a night- 
sky roof to match its name, stars 
and the Milky Way and the Southern 
Cross such as nobody ever in history 
actually saw from anywhere on Ven- 
us. Tourists were lined up behind a 



81 




velvet rope waiting to get in. But 
not us. It was, “This way, if you 
please, Stockholder,” to an elevated 
table right by the floor and across 
from the orchestra. 

We danced and we ate foods I’ve 
never heard of and I let a glass of 
champagne be poured for me but 
didn’t try to drink it because the 
bubbles go up my nose — and wished 
for a glass of milk or at least a 
glass of water because some of the 
food was quite spicy, but didn’t 
ask for it. 

But Dexter leaned over me and 
said, “Poddy, my spies tell me that 
you like milk.” 

“I do!” 

“So do I. But I’m too shy to order 
it unless I have somebody to back 
me up.” He raised a finger and two 
glasses of milk appeared instantly. 

But I noticed that he hardly 
touched his. 

However I did not realize I had 
been hoaxed until later. A singer, 
part of the floor show, a tall hand- 
some dark girl dressed as a gypsy — 
if gypsies did ever dress that way, 
which I doubt, but she was billed 
as “Romany Rose” — toured the ring- 
side tables singing topical verses to 
a popular song. 

She stopped in front of us, looked 
right at me and smiled, struck a 
couple of chords and sang: 

“Poddy Fries came to town. 

Pretty, winsome Poddy — 

Silver shoes and sky blue gown, 

Lovely darling Podkayne— 

“She has sailed the starry sea, 



Pour another toddy! 

Lucky Dexter, lucky we! 

Drink a toast to Poddy!” 

And everybody clapped and Clark 
pounded on the table and Romany 
Rose curtseyed to me and I started 
to cry and covered my face with 
my hands and suddenly remembered 
that I mustn’t cry because of my 
makeup and dabbed at my eyes with 
my napkin and hoped I hadn’t ruined 
it, and suddenly silver .buckets with 
champagne appeared all over that 
big room and everybody did drink 
a toast to me, standing up when 
Dexter stood up in a sudden silence 
brought on by a roll of drums. 

I was speechless and just barely 
knew enough to stay seated my- 
self and nod and try to smile when 
he looked at me — 

— and he broke his glass, just like 
story tapes, and everybody imitated 
him and for a while there was crash 
and tinkle all over the room, and I 
felt like Ozma just after she stops 
being Tip and is Ozma again and 
I had to remember my makeup very 
hard indeed! 

Later on, after I had gulped my 
stomach back into place and could 
stand up without trembling, I danced 
with Dexter again. He is a dreamy 
dancer — a firm, sure lead without 
ever turning it into a wrestling match. 
During a waltz I said, “Dexter? You 
spilled that glass of soda water. On 
purpose.” 

“Yes. How did you know?” 
“Because it is a sky blue dress — 
or the color that is called ‘sky blue,* 



82 




for Earth, although I’ve never seen a 
sky this color. And my shoes are 
silvered. So it couldn’t have been an 
accident. Any of it.” 

He just grinned, not a bit 
ashamed. “Only a little of it. I went 
first to your hilton. It took almost 
half an hour to find out who had 
taken you where and I was furious, 
because Papa would have been most 
vexed. But I found you.” 

I chewed that over and didn’t 
like the ta-ste. “Then you did it be- 
cause your Daddy told you to. Told 
you to entertain me because I’m 
Uncle Tom’s niece.” 

“No, Poddy.” 

“Huh? Better check through the 
circuits again. That’s how the num- 
bers read.” 

“No, Poddy. Papa would never 
order me to entertain a lady — other 
than formally, at our cottage — lady 
on my arm at dinner, that sort of 
thing. What he did do was show 
me a picture of you and ask me if 
I wanted to. And I decided I did 
want to. But it wasn’t a very good 
picture of you, didn’t do you justice. 
Just one snapped by one of the ser- 
vants of the Tannhauser when you 
didn’t know it — 

(I decided I had to find some 
way to get rid of Maria and Maria, 
a girl needs privacy. Although this 
hadn’t turned out too dry.) 

But he was sill talking.** — and 
when I did find you I almost didn’t 
recognize you, you were so much 
more dazzling than the photograph. 
I almost shied off from introducing 
myself. Then I got the wonderful 
idea of turning it into an accident. 



I stood behind you with that glass 
of soda water almost against your 
elbow for so long the bubbles all 
went out of it — and when you did 
move you bumped me so gently I 
had to slop it over myself to make 
it enough of an accident to let 
me be properly apologetic.” He 
grinned most disarmingly. 

“I see,” I said. “But, look, Dexter, 
the photograph was probably a very 
good one. This isn’t my own face.” 
I explained what Girdie had done. 

H e shrugged. “Then some day 
wash it for me and let me 
look at the real Poddy. I’ll bet I’ll 
recognize her. Look, dear, the ac- 
cident was only half fake, too. We’re 
even.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“They named me ‘Dexter’ for my 
maternal grandfather, before they 
found out I was left-handed. Then 
it was a case of either renaming me 
‘Sinister,’ which doesn’t sound too 
well — or changing me over to right- 
handed. But that didn't work out 
either. It just made me the clumsiest 
man on three planets — ” (This 
while twirling me through a figure 
eight!) 

“ — I'm always spilling things, 
knocking things over. You can fol- 
low me by the sound of fractured 
frangibles. The problem was not to 
cause an accident, but to keep from 
spilling that water until the right 
instant.” He grinned that impish 
grin. “I feel very triumphant about 
it. But forcing me out of left-hand- 
edness did something else to me too. 
It’s made me a natural-born rebel —

and I think you are one, too.” 

“I certainly am. I am expected to 
be Chairman of the Board someday, 
like my papa and my grandpapa. 
But I shan’t. I’m going to space.” 
“Oh! So am I!” We stopped danc- 
ing and chattered about spacing. 
Dexter intends to be an explorer 
captain just like me. Only I didn’t 
quite admit that my plans for spac- 
ing included pilot and master; it is 
never well in dealing with a male 
to let him know that you think you 
can do whatever it is he can do best 
or wants to do most. But Dexter 
intends to go to Cambridge and 
study paramagnetics and Davis me- 
chanics and be ready when the first 
true star ships are ready. Goodness! 

“Poddy, maybe we’ll even do it 
together. Lots of billets for women 
in star ships.” 

I agreed that that was so. 

“But let’s talk about you. Poddy, 
it wasn’t that you looked so much 
better than your picture.” 

“No?” (I felt vaguely disappointed.) 
“No. Look. I know your back- 
ground, I know you’ve lived all your 
life in Marsopolis. Me, I’ve been 
everywhere. Sent to Earth for school, 
took the Grand Tour while I was 
there, been to Luna, of course, and 
all over Venus — and to Mars. When 
you were a little girl. I wish I had 
met you then.” 

“Thank you.” (I was beginning to 
feel like a poor relation.) 

“So I know exactly what a honky- 
tonk town Venusberg is . and 
what a shock it is to people the first 
time. Especially anyone reared in a 
gentle and civilized place like Mar- 



sopolis. Oh, I love my home town 
but I know what it is — I’ve been 
other places. Poddy? Look at me, 
Poddy. The thing that impressed me 
about you was your aplomb.” 
“Me?” 

“Your amazing and perfect savoir- 
faire . under conditions I knew 
were strange to you. Your uncle* has 
been everywhere, and Girdie, I take 
it, has been, too. But lots of stran- 
gers here, older women, become 
quite giddy when first exposed to 
the fleshpots of Venusberg. But 
you carry yourself like a queen.” 
(This man I liked! Definitely. Aft- 
er years and years of “Beat it, runt!” 
it does something to a woman to be 
told she has savoir-faire. I didn’t 
even stop to wonder if he told all 
the girls that — I didn’t want to!) 

W e didn’t stay much longer. Gir- 
die made it plain that I had 
to get my “beauty sleep.” So Clark 
went back to his game (Jose ap- 
peared out of nowhere at the right 
time — and I thought of telling Clark 
he had better git fer home, too, but 
I decided that wasn’t “savoir-faire” 
and anyhow he wouldn’t have lis- 
tened) and Dexter took us to the 
Tannhauser in his Papa’s Rolls (or 
maybe his own, I don’t know) and 
bowed over our hands and kissed 
them as he left us. 

I was wondering if he would try 
to kiss me good night and had made 
up my mind to be cooperative about 
it. But he didn’t try. Maybe it’s not 
a Venusberg custom, I don’t know. 

Girdie went up with me because 
I wanted to chatter. I bounced my- 



85 




self on a couch and said, “Oh, Gir- 
die, it’s been the most wonderful 
night of my life!” 

“It hasn’t been a bad night for 
me,” she said quietly. “It certainly 
can’t hurt me to have met the son 
of the Chairman of the Board.” It 
was then that she told me that she 
was staying on Venus. 

“But, Girdie — why?** 

“Because I’m broke, dear. I need 
a job.” 

“You? But you’re rich. Everybody 
knows that.” 

She smiled. “I was rich, dear. But 
my last husband went through it all. 
He was an optimistic man and ex- 
cellent company. But not nearly the 
businessman he thought he was. So 
now Girdie must gird her loins and 
get to work. Venusberg is better 
than Earth for that. Back home I 
could either be a parasite on my old 
friends until they got sick of me — 
the chronic house guest. Or get one 
of them to give me a job that would 
really be charity, since I don’t know 
anything. Or disappear into the low- 
er depths and change my name. 
Here, nobody cares and there is al- 
ways work for anyone who wants 
to work. I don’t drink and I don’t 
gamble. Venusberg is made to or- 
der for me.” 

“But what will you do?** It was 
hard to imagine her as anything but 
the rich society girl whose parties 
and pranks were known even on 
Mars. 

“Croupier, I hope. They make the 
highest wages . and I’ve been 
studying it. I’ve been practicing deal- 
ing, too — for blackjack, or faro, or 

86 



chemin de fer. But I’ll probably have 
to start as a change girl.” 

“Change girls? Girdie, would you 
dress that way?” 

She shrugged. “My figure is 
still good . and I’m quite quick at 
counting money. It’s honest work, 
Poddy. It has to be. Those change 
girls often have as much as ten 
thousand on their trays.” 

I decided I had fubbed and shut 
up. I guess you can take the girl 
out of Marsopolis but you cap’t quite 
take Marsopolis out of the girl. 
Those change girls practically don’t 
wear anything but the trays they 
carry money on. But it certainly 
was honest work and Girdie has a 
figure that had all the junior officers 
in the Tricorn running in circles 
and dropping one wing. I’m sure she 
could have married any of the bach- 
elors and insured her old age thereby 
with no effort. 

Isn’t it more honest to work? And, 
if so, why shouldn’t she capitalize 
her assets? 

She kissed me goodnight soon aft- 
er and ordered me to go right to 
bed and to sleep. Which I did — all 
but sleep. Well, she wouldn’t be a 
change girl long; she’d be a croupier 
in a beautiful evening gown . and 
saving her wages and her tips and 
someday she would be a stockholder, 
one share anyway, which is all any- 
body needs for old age in the Venus 
Corporation. And I would come 
back and visit her when I was fam- 
ous. 

I wondered if I could ask Dexter 
to put in a good word for her to 
Dom Pedro? 




Then I thought about Dexter — 
I know this can’t be love; I was 
in love once and it feels entirely 
different. It hurts. 

This just feels grand. 

X 

I hear that Clark has been negotiat- 
ing to sell me (black market, of 
course) to one of the concessionaires 
who ship wives out to contract col- 
onists in the bush. Or so they say. 
I do not know the truth. But There 
Are Rumors. 

What infuriates me is that he is 
said to be offering me at a ridicu- 
lously low price! 

But in truth it is this very fact 
that convinces me that it is just a 
rumor, carefully planted by Clark 
himself, to annoy me — because, 
while I would not put it past 
Clark to sell me into what is tanta- 
mount to chattel slavery and a Life 
of Shame if he could get away with 
it, nevertheless he would wring out 
of the sordid transaction every penny 
the traffic would bear. This is 
certain. 

It is much more likely that he is 
suffering a severe emotional reac- 
tion from having opened up and be- 
come almost human with me the 
other night — and therefore found it 
necessary to counteract it with this 
rumor in order to restore our re- 
lations to their normal, healthy, 
cold-war status. 

Actually I don’t think he could 
get away with it, even on the black 
market, because I don’t have any 
contract with the Corporation. Even 
if he forged one, I could always 



manage to get a message to Dexter, 
and Clark knows this. Girdie tells 
me that the black market in wives 
lies mostly in change girls or clerks 
or hilton chambermaids who haven’t 
managed to snag husbands in Venus- 
burg (where men are in short sup- 
ply) and are willing to cooperate in 
being sold out back (where wonien 
are scarce) in order to jump their 
contracts. They don’t sqiiawk and 
the Corporation overlooks the mat- 
ter. 

Most of the bartered brides, of 
course, are single women among 
the immigrants, right off a ship. The 
concessionaires pay their fare and 
squeeze whatever cumshaw they can 
out of the women themselves and the 
miners or ranchers to whom their 
contracts are assigned. All Kosher. 

Not that I understand it. I don’t 
understand anything about how this 
planet really works. No laws, just 
Corporate regulations. Want to get 
married? Find somebody who claims 
to be a priest or a preacher and have 
any ceremony you like — but it hasn’t 
any legal standing because it is not 
a contract with the Corporation. 
Want a divorce? Pack your clothes 
and get out, leaving a note or not 
as you see fit. Illegitimacy? They’ve 
never heard of it. A baby is a baby 
and the Corporation won’t let one 
want, because that baby will grow 
up and be an employe and Venus 
has a chronic labor shortage. Polyg- 
amy? Polandry? Who cares? The 
Corporation doesn’t. 

Bodily assault? Don’t try it in Ven- 
usberg. It is the most thoroughly 
policed city in the system — violent 

87 




crime is bad for business. I don’t 
wander around alone in some parts 
of Marsopolis, couth as my home 
town is, because some of the old 
sand rats are a bit sun struck and 
not really responsible. But I’m per- 
fectly safe alone anywhere in Venus- 
berg. The only assault I risk is from 
super-salesmanship. 

(The bush is another matter. Not 
the people so much, but Venus itself 
is lethal — and there is always a 
chance of encountering a Venerian 
who has gotten hold of a grain of 
happy dust. Even the little wingety 
fairies are bloodthirsty if they sniff 
happy dust.) 

Murder? This is a very serious vio- 
lation of regulations. You’ll have 
your pay checked for years and 
years and years to offset both that 
employe’s earning power for what 
would have been his working life . 
and his putative value to the Cor- 
poration, all calculated by the com- 
pany’s actuaries who are widely 
known to have no hearts at all, 
just liquid helium pumps. 

S o, if you are thinking of killing 
anybody on Venus, don’t do it! 
Lure him to a planet where murder 
is a social matter and all they do 
is hang you or something. No fu- 
ture in it on Venus. 

There are three classes of people 
on Venus: stockholders, employes 
and a^ large middle ground. Stock- 
holder-employes (Girdie’s ambition), 
enterprise employes (taxi drivers, 
ranchers, prospectors, some retail- 
ers, etc.) — and of course future 
employes, children still being educa- 



ted. And there are tourists. But 
tourists aren’t people. They have 
more the status of steers in a cattle 
pen — valuable assets to be treated 
with great consideration but no pity. 

A person from out-planet can 
be a tourist for an hour or a life- 
time — just as long as his money 
holds. No visa, no rules of any sort, 
everybody welcome — but you must 
have a return ticket and you can’t 
cash it in until after you sign a con- 
tract with the Corporation. If you 
do. I wouldn’t. 

I still don’t understand how the 
system works even though Uncle 
Tom has been very patient in ex- 
plaining. But he says he doesn’t un- 
derstand it either. He calls it “cor- 
porate fascism” — which explains 
nothing — and says that he can’t 
make up his mind whether it is the 
grimmest tyranny the human race 
has ever known ... or the most per- 
fect democracy in history. 

He says that nothing here is as 
bad in many ways as the conditions 
over 90% of the people on Earth 
endure — and that it isn’t even as bad 
in creature comforts and standards 
of living as lots of people on Mars, 
especially the sand rats, even though 
we never knowingly let anyone 
starve for lack of medical attention. 

I Just Don’t Know. I can see now 
that all my life I have simply taken 
for granted the way we do things on 
Mars. Oh. sure, I learned about oth- 
er systems in school — but it didn’t 
soak in. Now I am beginning to 
grasp emotionally that There Are 
Other Ways Than Ours . and that 
people can be happy under them. 




Take Girdie. I can see why she 
didn’t want to stay on Barth, not 
the way things had changed for her. 
But she could have stayed on Mars; 
she’s just the sort of high class im- 
migrant we want. But Mars didn’t 
tempt her at all. 

This bothered me because (as you 
may have gathered) I think Mars is 
just about perfect. And I think Gir- 
die is just about perfect. 

Yet a horrible place like Venus- 
berg is what she picked. She says it 
is a Challenge. 

Furthermore Uncle Tom says that 
she is Dead Right; Girdie will have 
Venusberg eating out of her hand in 
two shakes and be a stockholder 
before you can say Extra Dividend. 

I guess she’s right. I felt awfully 
sorry for Girdie when I found out 
she was broke. “I wept that I had 
no shoes — till I met a man who had 
no feet.” Like that, I mean. I’ve 
never been broke, never missed any 
meals, never worried about the fu- 
ture — yet I used to feel sorry for 
Poddy when money was a little tight 
around home and I couldn’t have a 
new party dress. Then I found out 
that the rich and glamorous Miss 
FitzSnugglie (I still won’t use her 
right name, it wouldn’t be fair) had 
only her ticket back to Earth and 
had borrowed the money for that. 
I was so sorry it hurt. 

B ut now I’m beginning to realize 
that Girdie has her “feet” no 
matter what, and will always land 
on them. 

She has indeed been a change 
girl, for two whole nights — and 
asked me, please, to see to it that 



Clark did not go to Dom Pedro 
Casino those nights. 1 don’t think 
she cared at all whether or not I 
saw her . but she knows what 
a horrible case of puppy love Clark 
has on her and she’s just so sweet 
and good all through that she did 
not want to risk making it worse 
and/or shocking him. 

But she’s a dealer now and tak- 
ing lessons for croupier, and Clark 
goes there every night. But she won’t 
let him play at her table. She told 
him point blank that he could know 
her socially or professionally, but 
not both — and Clark never argues 
with the inevitable. He plays at some 
other table and tags her around 
whenever possible. 

Do you suppose that my kid broth- 
er actually does possess psionic pow- 
ers? I know he’s not a telepath, else 
he would have cut my throat long 
since. But he is still winning. 

Dexter assures me that (a) the 
games are absolutely honest, and (b) 
that no one can possibly beat them, 
not in the long run, because the 
house collects its percentage no mat- 
ter what. “Certainly you can win. 
Poddy,” he assured me. “One tour- 
ist came here last year and took 
home over half a million. We paid 
it happily — and advertised it all over 
Earth — and still made money the 
very week he struck it rich. Don’t 
you even suspect that we are giv- 
ing your brother a break. If he 
keeps it up long enough, we will not 
only win it all back but take every 
buck he started with. If he’s as smart 
as you say he is, he’ll quit while he’s 
ahead. But most people aren’t that 

89 




smart — and Venus Corporation nev- 
er gambles on anything but a sure 
thing.” 

Again, I don’t know. But it was 
both Girdie and winning that caused 
Clark to become almost human with 
me. For a while. 

It was last week, the night I met 
Dexter — and Girdie told me to go to 
bed and I did but I couldn’t sleep. I 
left my door open so that I could 
hear Clark come in — or if I didn’t, 
phone somebody and have him 
chased home because, while Uncle 
Tom is responsible for both of us, 
I’m responsible for Clark and always 
have been. I wanted Clark to be 
home and in bed before Uncle Tom 
got up. Habit, I guess. 

He did come sneaking in about 
two hours after I did and I psst'd 
to him and he came into my room. 

You never saw a six-year-old boy 
with so much money! 

Josie had seen him to our door, 
so he said. Don’t ask me why he 
didn’t put it in the Tannhauser’s 
vault. Or do ask me. I think he 
wanted to fondle it. 

He certainly wanted to boast. He 
laid it out in stacks on my bed, 
counting it and making sure that I 
knew how much it was. He even 
shoved a pile toward me. “Need 
some. Poddy? I won’t even charge 
you interest. Plenty more where this 
came from.” * 

1 was breathless. Not the money, 
1 didn’t need any money. But 
the offer. There had been times in 
the past when Clark has lent me 
money against my allowance — and 

90 



charged me exactly 100% interest 
come allowance day. Till Daddy 
caught and spanked us both. 

So I thanked him most sincerely 
and hugged him. Then he said, 
“Sis, how old would you say Girdie 
is?” 

I began to understand his off- 
the-curve behavior. “I really couldn’t 
guess,” I answered carefully. (Didn’t 
need to guess. I knew.) “Why don’t 
you ask her?” 

“I did. She just smiled at me 
and said that women don’t have 
birthdays.” 

“Probably an Earth custom,” I 
told him and let it go at that. “Clark, 
how in the world did you win so 
much money?” 

“Nothing to it,” he said. “All 
those games, somebody wins, some- 
body loses. I just make sure I’m 
one who wins.” 

“But how?” 

He just grinned his worst grin. 

“How much money did you start 
with?” 

He suddenly looked guarded. But 
he was still amazingly mellow, for 
Clark, so I pushed ahead. I said, 
“Look, if I know you, you can’t get 
all your fun out of it unless some- 
body knows, and you’re safer telling 
me than anyone else. Because I’ve 
never told on you yet. Now have I?” 

He admitted that this was true by 
not answering. It is true. When he 
was small enough, I used to clip 
him one occasionally. But I never 
tattled on him. Lately clipping him 
has become entirely too dangerous; 
he can give me a fat lip quicker 
than I can give him one. But I’ve 




never tattled on him. “Loosen up,” 
I urged him. “I’m the only one you 
dare boast to. How much were you 
paid to sneak those three kilos into 
the Tricorn in my baggage?” 

He looked very smug. “Enough.” 
“Okay, I won’t pry any further 
about that. But what was it you 
smuggled? You’ve had me utterly 
baffled.” 

“You would have found it if you 
hadn’t been so silly anxious to ex- 
plore the ship. Poddy, you’re stupid. 
You know that, don’t you? You’re 
as predictable as the law of gravity. 
I can Ob: ays outguess you.” 

I didn’t get mad. If Clark gets 
you sore, he’s got you. 

“Guess maybe,” I admitted. “Are 
you going to tell me what it was? 
Not happy dust, I hope?” 

“Oh, no!” he said and looked 
shocked. “You know what they do 
to you for happy dust around here? 



They turn you over to natives who 
are hopped up with it, that’s what 
they do — and then they don’t even 
have to bother to cremate you.” 

I shuddered and returned to the 
subject. “Going to tell me?” 

“Mmm ...” 

“I swear by Saint Podkayne Not 
to Tell.” This is my own private 
oath, nobody else would or could 
use it. 

“Better not,” he warned me. “You 
won’t like it.” 

“By Saint Podkayne!” (and I 
should have kept my lip zipped.) 

“Okay,” he said. “But you swore 
it. A bomb.” 

“A what?" 

“Oh, not much of a bomb. Just 
a little squeezer job. Total destruc- 
tion not more than a kilometer. 
Nothing much.”

IF # Short Story 



ROAD STOP 

by David Mason 



T he highway stretched away in 
ruler-straight perspective to- 
ward both horizon’s, black and shin- 
ing in the sun like a river of ink. 
Beside it, the bright pastel buildings 
of Rest Stop 25 stood among the 
green trees. Occasionally a car shot 
past, a flash of metal and a hiss of 
split wind; but the road was one 
which was used more often at night, 
and was nearly empty in the after- 
noon. 

Sam was the only attendant on 
duty. Stop 25 needed only two hu- 
man attendants, even at its busiest 
hours. He * sat, staring out at the 
highway, his elbows on the lunch 
counter, his round face blank, but 
his mouth set tightly. The phone 
at his elbow emitted a small grunting 
noise. 

“You still there?” the phone voice 
said inquiringly. 

97 



It was like any other car on 
the road. It was automatic, 
self-contained — and eternal! 



“Yeah.” Sam said, still staring at 
the highway. 

“Well . ” The voice paused. 
“Look, it might not come your way. 
It usually turns west at the New Bri- 
tain intersection.” 

“Not always.” Sam said. “It went 
by here once before.” 

“It almost never stops, anyway,” 
the voice said firmly. “It won’t stop.” 
“Some times it does,” Sam said. 
“It doesn’t have to.” 

Sam shrugged and said nothing. 
“Okay, then,” the voice said. “I 
called you about it, anyway.” 
“Thanks.” 

Sam turned away, still watching 
the road. 

Far off a speck of metal gleamed, 
growing larger. The distant high 
sound of brakes began, as a car de- 
celerated, coming toward the Stop. 
It was just an ordinary car, Sam 



told himself. That other car was 
still hundreds of miles away. But 
his hands were damp as he watched 
it grow larger. 

It was an ordinary Talman sedan, 
with two people in it. It swung into 
the Stop’s parking area, and its doors 
slid open smoothly. A small red light 
flashed on its arched front. The 
repair signal. In response the doors 
of the Repair shop opened. The Tal- 
man waited, as a man and a woman 
emerged from its padded interior 
and moved slowly into the Repair 
shop. The doors closed behind it. 

The couple came toward the res- 
taurant, where Sam stood waiting. 

“Hi,” the man said to Sam. 

“Afternoon.” Sam moved to the 
counter. “Something to eat while 
you’re waiting, folks?” 

The tall, dark girl glanced out 
at the closed doors of the Repair 
shop. 

“How long’s that car going to 
take?” she asked in a tired voice. 
“I wanted to get home tonight.” 

“Not long,” Sam said. “It didn’t 
look like anything complicated.” 

“How can you tell?” the man 
asked, sitting down. “It could take 
all night.” 

“Like something to eat while 
you’re waiting?” Sam asked. 

The woman stared at the lunch 
racks critically. 

“I never like these places to eat 
in,” the woman said, curling her 
lip. “You never know how long 
the food’s been stored in the robot.” 

“Oh, hell, Grace,” the man said 
wearily. To Sam he gave an apolo- 
getic shrug. “Just coffee.” 



“Well, you don’t know,” the wom- 
an insisted. “I mean ...” She 
watched Sam drawing the coffee 
into a cup. “I used to cook a lot, by 
hand, till Jack had the autokitchen 
put in. He never had any stomach 
trouble till then. It’s getting so 
everything’s ... oh, I don’t know. It’s 
all out of reach. You don’t know 
what’s happening any more. Like 
the car.” 

“I wish I knew what she’s talking 
about half the time.” Jack said, 
blowing on his coffee. Sam leaned 
on the counter, looking past the 
couple toward the empty road. 

“I know what the lady means,” 
Sam said, almost to himself. “You 
get to thinking . well, I can re- 
member when people used to drive 
their own cars. Themselves. Steering 
and everything, except on the big- 
gest highways. And everything got 
done with people. People made 
things, and cooked food, and grew 
plants. Everybody was busy all the 
time. It was better then.” 

The man called Jack shrugged. 
“Sure, sure. Everybody always talks 
about the good old days. But I 
don’t see many of ’em going to live 
in the woods. Like Grace — she says 
she doesn’t like the autokitchen, but 
she uses it.” 

“It saves time,” Grace said. I 
guess I will have coffee, too, mister.” 

“It saves time, she says,” Jack 
said. “For what? She’s got too much 
time now.” 

“I wonder what it must have been 
like in the old days, here,” Grace 
said vaguely, staring around the 
lunchroom. “Everybody running in 

93 




and out. All the drivers — trucks, 
with men in them, the way you read 
about it in the historical novels. Men 
that drove their own cars, in all 
kinds of weather . gee.” 

“Just like on TV,” Sam said, 
grinning. 

“I hope we get the car out of 
there pretty soon,” Jack said anx- 
iously. He glanced out toward the 
silent garage. “I always wonder 
what would happen if the machinery 
stuck, or something. How would 
you ever get your car out?” 

“It doesn’t get stuck,” Sam said. 
A peculiar look crossed his face as 
he added, “Not any more.” 

“Did it ever?” 

Sam shrugged. “Oh, well, you 
know twenty or thirty years ago all 
this automatic stuff wasn’t quite so 
good as it is now. Cars, repair shops 
. things went wrong, sometimes. 
Like . like the Traveler.” 

“The Traveler?” The woman 
looked up. “Oh, that’s just a ghost 
story. Like the Flying Dutchman. 
Isn’t it?” 

The lunchroom was completely 
silent. Sam was no longer paying 
any attention to the couple sitting 
at the counter. He was close to the 
big window, standing stiffly, feet 
apart, like an admiral on a ship’s 
bridge, his eyes studying the empty 
horizon. There, where the lines 
of the road met with the precision 
of a drawing-board exercise in per- 
spective, he thought he saw a fleck 
of light. 

“It isn’t when it goes past,” Sam 
said, in a quiet tight voice. He 
talked at the window, his back to 

94 



the other two, his words meant 
mostly for himself. 

“It’s not its going by. That doesn’t 
bother me,” he repeated. “It came 
by my old place five or six times, I 
remember. That’s why I finally asked 
to be transferred out here, where it 
hardly ever goes by. But I could 
have gotten used to it. I mean, you 
don’t have to look at it, or anything. 
It’s just another car. Old, sure, but 
there’s no difference. A car goes by, 
that’s all. Only ...” 

“You mean it’s real?” the woman 
asked, in a low voice. 

Her husband’s eyes were looking 
out, toward the empty road, follow- 
ing Sam’s look. 

“The Traveler,” he said, without 
looking at his wife. “Sure, it’s real. 
Why’d you think they don’t make 
that model of car any more? It’s 
real. I knew somebody who saw it, 
once.” 

“There might even be two or three 
Travelers,” Sam said, watching the 
distant glitter of light. There was 
certainly a car coming. Just a car 
. although it was still too far 
away to tell for sure. 

“A haunted car!” the woman said, 
her eyes wider. “Gee!” 

“It isn’t a haunted car,” her 
husband said. “It’s just one of the 
earliest makes of automatic high- 
way cars. Everything automatic, 
steering, destination set . just like 
any car is, nowadays. Only it wasn’t 
quite perfect, somehow.” 

“They got into their car,” Sam 
said, his eyes picking out distant, 
microscopic details. The high flar- 
ing fins, the double headlamps . • 




lit up, although it was broad day- 
light on the road. He knew what 
the rest would be. It was moving so 
slowly. But it always moved slowly, 
barely thirty miles an hour. As if 
somebody wanted you to look and 
see . 

“They just got in, the way any- 
body would do,” Sam said. “They 
set a destination, and the windows 
closed up, and the airconditioner 
went on, and the car went out on 
the road.” 

“Only it never got there,” the 
other man said. “Wherever it was 
going to go.” 

“But ...” the woman looked 
puzzled. “Wouldn’t anybody stop it? 
I mean, wouldn’t it run out of fuel, 
or . well, how did the people in 
it get out?” 

“It does just what any car does,” 
her husband told her. “It gets fuel 
when it needs it. You can’t just stop 
a robot control device. Not till it’s 
good and ready.” 

“But the people in it,” she said. 
“They’d starve, or something ...” 

The car called the Traveler, roll- 
ing at the stately thirty miles an 
hour it always held, was coming 
down the road now, and the two 
men stood, watching. The woman, 
a little behind them, watched too, 
her face growing whiter. No one 
said anything as the old fashioned 
car rolled by, straight and steady 



down the highway, holding the cen- 
ter of the lane as sharply as it al- 
ways did. 

There was a film of dust inside 
the windows, though the Traveler 
was clean and shining outside. But 
the film did hide the white bone 
faces, the despairing hands that had 
long ago stopped trying to break 
through those closed windows. 

“They never did get out,” the man 
named Jack said, as the Traveler 
rolled on, growing smaller along 
the endless road. 

“I don’t mind it when it goes 
past,” Sam said, his voice thinner 
edged. “I really don’t. It’s just a 
car. Things like that used to hap- 
pen. I mean, it’s a car. Even when it 
stops to get gas, I don’t have to 
pay any attention.” 

He looked at the couple, his 
mouth loose. “As long as it just 
goes on. That’s all right. But I keep 
thinking some day it’ll stop. And 
the door will open. And maybe . 
maybe they’ll want lunch.” 

He giggled uncontrollably, and 
then choked it back. 

Outside, the big hangar doors of 
the repair shop opened. The car 
that had been inside appeared; it 
moved out and stopped, its doors 
open invitingly. 

“Your car’s ready now,” Sam 
told the couple. “So long, folks. 
Have a nice trip.” END

IF • Short Story 



FORTRESS 

SHIP 



by Fred Saherhagen 



Huge as an island, mighty as a squadron 
of dreadnaughts, old as time, the ship 
of the aliens was out to destroy them! 



T he machine was a vast fortress, 
containing no life, set by its 
long-dead masters to destroy any- 
thing that lived. It and a hundred 
like it were the inheritance of Earth 
from some war fought between un- 
known interstellar empires, in some 
time that could hardly be connected 
with any Earthly calendar. 

One such machine could hang over 
a planet colonized by men and in 
two days pound the surface into a 
lifeless cloud of dust and steam, a 
hundred miles deep. This particular 
machine had already done just that. 

It used no predictable tactics in its 
dedicated, unconscious war against 
life. The ancient, unknown games- 
men had built it as a random factor, 
to be loosed in the enemy’s terri- 
tory to do what damage it might. 
Men thought its plan of battle was 
chosen by the random disintegrations 



of atoms in a block of some long- 
lived isotope buried deep inside it, 
and so was not even in theory pre- 
dictable by opposing brains, human 
or electronic. 

Men called it a berserker. 

D el Murray, sometime computer 
specialist, had called it other 
names than that; but right now he 
was too busy to waste breath, as he 
moved in staggering lunges around 
the little cabin of his one-man fight- 
er, plugging in replacement units 
for equipment damaged by the last 
near-miss of a small berserker mis- 
sile. An animal resembling a large 
dog with an ape’s forelegs moved 
about the cabin too, carrying in its 
nearly human hands a supply of 
emergency sealing patches. The cab- 
in air was full of haze. Wherever 
movement of the haze showed a leak 



f 7 




to an unpressurized part of the hull, 
the dog-ape moved to skillfully apply 
a patch. 

“Hello, Foxglove!” the man shout- 
ed, hoping his radio was again in 
working order. 

“Hello, Murray, this is Foxglove,” 
said a sudden loud voice in the 
cabin. “How far did you get?” 

Del was too weary to show much 
relief that his communications were 
open again. “I’ll let you know in a 
minute. At least it’s stopped shoot- 
ing at me for a while. Move, New- 
ton.” The alien animal, pet and ally, 
called an axyan , moved away from 
the man’s feet and kept single-mind- 
edly looking for leaks. 

After another minute’s work Del 
could strap his body into the deep- 
cushioned command chair again, 
with something like an operational 
panel before him. That last near- 
miss had sprayed the whole cabin 
with fine penetrating splinters. It 
was remarkable that man and aiyan 
had come through unwounded. 

His radar working again, Del 
could say: “I’m about ninety miles 
out from it. Foxglove. On the oppo- 
site side from you.” His present 
position was what he had been try- 
ing to achieve since the battle had 
begun. 

The two Earth ships and the ber- 
serker were half a light year from 
the nearest sun. The berserker could 
not leap out of normal space, toward 
the defenseless colonies on the plan- 
ets of that sun, while the two ships 
stayed close to it. There were only 
two men aboard Foxglove. Though 
they had more machinery working 

98 



for them than did Del, both manned 
ships were mites compared to their 
opponent. 

If a berserker machine like this 
one, not much smaller in cross-sec- 
tion than New Jersey, had drifted in 
a century earlier and found men 
crowded on one planet, there could 
have been no real struggle and no 
human survivors. Now, though the 
impersonal enemy swarmed through 
the galaxy, men could rise up in a 
cloud to meet them. 

Del’s radar showecl him an an- 
cient ruin of metal, spread out for 
a hundred miles before him. Men 
had blown holes in it the size of 
Manhattan Island, and melted pud- 
dles of slag as big as lakes upon 
its surface. 

But the berserker’s power was still 
enormous. So far no man had fought 
it and survived. Now, it could squash 
Del’s little ship like a mosquito; it 
was wasting its unpredictable sub- 
tlety on him. Yet there was a special 
taste of terror in the very indif- 
ference of it. Men could never frighten 
this enemy, as it frightened them. 

Earth men’s tactics, worked out 
from bitter experience against other 
berserkers, called for a simultane- 
ous attack by three ships. Foxglove 
and Murray made two. A third was 
supposedly on the way, but still about 
eight hours distant, moving at C- 
plus velocity, outside of normal 
space and so out of communication 
with the others. Until it arrived, 
Foxglove and Murray must hold the 
berserker at bay, while it brooded 
unguessable schemes. 

It might attack either ship at any 




' moment, or it might seek to disen- 
: gage. It might wait hours for them 
to make the first move — though it 
would certainly fight if the men at- 
tacked it. It had learned the language 
of Earth — it might try to talk with 
them. But always, ultimately, it would 
seek to destroy them and every oth- 
er living thing it met. That was the 
basic command given it by the an- 
cient warlords. 

A thousand years ago, it would 
have easily swept ships of the type 
that now opposed it from its path, 
whether they carried fusion missiles 
or not. Now, it was no doubt in some 
electrical way conscious of its own 
weakening by accumulated damage. 
And perhaps in long centuries of 
fighting its way across the galaxy 
it had learned to be wary. 

N ow, quite suddenly, Del’s detec- 
tors showed forcefields form- 
ing in behind his ship. Like the en- 
circling arms of a great bear they 
blocked his path away from the en- 
emy. He waited for some deadly 
blow, with his hand trembling over 
the red button that would salvo his 
atomic missiles at the berserker — 
but if he attacked alone, or even with 
Foxglove, the infernal machine 
would parry their missiles, crush 
their ships and go on to destroy 
another helpless planet. Three ships 
were needed to attack. The red firing 
button was now only a last desper- 
ate resort. 

Del was reporting the forcefields 
to Foxglove when he felt the first 
hint in his mind of another attack. 
“Newton!” he called sharply, leav- 



ing the mike to Foxglove open. They 
would hear and understand what was 
going to happen. 

The aiyan bounded instantly from 
its combat couch to stand before Del 
as if hypnotized, all attention riveted 
on the man. Del sometimes bragged: 
“Show Newton a drawing of dif- 
ferent colored lights, convince him it 
represents a particular control pan- 
el, and he’ll push buttons or whatev- 
er you tell, him, until the real panel 
matches the drawing.” 

But no aiyan had the human abil- 
ity to learn and to create on an ab- 
stract level; which was why Del was 
now going to put Newton in com- 
mand of his ship. 

He switched off the ship’s com- 
puters — they were going to be as use- 
less as his own brain, under the at- 
tack he felt gathering — and said to 
Newton: “Situation Zombie.” 

The animal responded instantly 
as it had been trained, seizing Del’s 
hands with firm insistence, and drag- 
ging them one at a time down beside 
the command chair to where the fet- 
ters had been installed. 

Hard experience had taught men 
something about the berserkers’ mind 
weapon, although its principles of 
operation were still unknown. It was 
slow in its onslaught, and its effects 
could not be steadily maintained for 
more than about two hours, after 
which a berserker was evidently 
forced to turn it off for an equal 
time. But while in effect, it robbed 
any human or electronic brain of 
the ability to plan or to predict — 
and left it unconscious of its own 
incapacity. 



99 




It seemed to De) that all this had 
happened before, maybe more than 
once. Newton, that funny fellow, 
had gone too far with his pranks; 
he had abandoned the little boxes of 
colored beads that were his favorite 
toys, and was moving the controls 
around at the lighted panel. Unwill- 
ing to share the fun with Del, he 
had tied the man to his chair some- 
how. Such behavior was really intol- 
erable, especially when there was 
supposed to be a battle in progress. 
Del tried to pull his hands free, and 
called to Newton. 

Newton whined earnestly and 
stayed at the panel. 

“Newt, you dog. Come, lemme 
loose. I know what I have to say: 
Four score and seven . hey, Newt, 
where’re your toys? Lemme see your 
pretty beads.” There were hundreds 
of tiny boxes of the varicolored 
beads, leftover trade goods that New- 
ton loved to sort out and handle. 
Del peered around the cabin, chuck- 
ling a little at his own cleverness. He 
would get Newton distracted by the 
beads, and then . the vague idea 
faded into other crackbrained gro- 
tesqueries. 

Newton whined now and then 
but stayed at the panel moving con- 
trols in the long sequence he had 
been taught, taking the ship through 
the feinting, evasive maneuvers that 
might fool a berserker into thinking 
that it was still competently manned. 
Newton never put a hand near the 
big red button. Only if he felt deadly 
pain himself, or found a dead man 
in Del’s chair, would he reach for 
that. 



“Ah, roger, Murray,” said the 
radio from time to time, as if ack- 
nowledging a message. Sometimes 
Foxglove added a few words or num- 
bers that might have meant some- 
thing. Del wondered what the talking 
was about. 

At last he understood that Fox- 
glove was trying to help maintain 
the illusion that there was still a 
competent brain in charge of Del’s 
ship. The fear-reaction came when 
he began to realize that he had once 
again lived through the effect of the 
mind-weapon. The brooding berser- 
ker, half genius, half idiot, had for- 
borne to press the attack when suc- 
cess would have been certain. Per- 
haps deceived, perhaps following the 
strategy that avoided predictability at 
almost any cost. 

“Newton.” The animal turned, 
hearing a change in his voice. Now 
Del could say the words that would 
tell Newton it was safe to set his 
master free, a sequence too long 
for anyone under the mindweapon to 
recite. 

“ — shall not perish from the 
Earth,” he finished. With a yelp of 
joy Newton pulled the fetters from 
Del’s hands. Del turned instantly to 
the radio. 

4 4 Tj' ffect has evidently been turned 
' off. Foxglove,” said Del’s 
voice through the speaker in the 
cabin of the larger ship. 

The Commander let out a sigh. 
“He’s back in control!” 

The Second Officer — there was 
no Third — said: “That means we’ve 
got some kind of fighting chance, 



100 




for the next two hours. I say let’s 
attack now!” 

The Commander shook his head, 
slowly but without hesitation. “With 
two ships, we don’t have any real 
chance. Less than four hours until 
Gizmo gets here. We have to stall 
until then, if we want to win.” 

“It’ll attack the next time it gets 
Del’s mind scrambled! I don’t think 
we fooled it for a minute . we’re 
out of range of the mindbeam here, 
but Del can’t withdraw now. And 
we can’t expect that aiyan to fight 
his ship for him. We’ll really have 
no chance, with Del gone.” 

The Commander’s eyes moved 
ceaselessly over his panel. “We’ll 
wait. We can’t be sure it’ll attack 
within — ” 

The berserker spoke suddenly, its 
radioed voice plain in the cabins of 
both ships: “I have a proposition for 
you, little ship.” Its voice had a 
cracking, adolescent quality, because 
it strung together words and syl- 
lables recorded from the voice of 
human prisoners of both sexes and 
different ages, from whom it had 
learned the language. There was no 
reason to think they had been kept 
alive after that. 

“Well?” Del’s voice sounded tough 
and carpable by comparison. 

“I have invented a game which 
we will play,” it said. “If you play 
well enough, I will not kill you right 
away.” 

“Now I’ve heard everything,” 
murmured the Second Officer. 

After three thoughtful seconds the 
Commander slammed a fist on the 
arm of his chair. “It means to test 



his learning ability, to run a con- 
tinuous check on his brain while it 
turns up the power of the mind- 
beam and tries different modula- 
tions. If it can make sure the mind- 
beam is working, it’ll attack in- 
stantly. I’ll bet my life on it. That’s 
the game it’s playing this time.” 

“I will think over your proposi- 
tion,” said Del’s voice coolly. 

“Very well,” answered the ber- 
serker. 

The Commander said: “It’s in no 
hurry to start. It won’t be able to 
turn on the mindbeam again for al- 
most two hours.” 

“But we need another two hours 
beyond that.” 

Del’s voice said: “Describe the 
game you want to play.” 

“It is a simplified version of the 
human game called checkers.” 

The Commander and the Second 
looked at each other, neither able 
to imagine Newton able to play 
checkers. Nor could they doubt 
that Newton’s failure would kill 
them within a few hours, and leave 
another planet open to destruction. 

After a minute’s silence, Del’s 
voice asked: “What’ll we use for a 
board?” 

“We will radio our moves to one 
another,” said the berserker equably. 
It went on to describe a checkers- 
like game, played on a smaller board 
with less than the normal number 
of pieces. There was nothing very 
profound about it; but of course 
playing would seem to require a 
functional brain, human or electron- 
ic, able to plan and to predict 
“If 1 agree to play,” said Del 

101 




slowly, “how’ll we decide who gets 
to move first?” 

“He’s trying to stall,” said the 
Commatjder, gnawing a thumbnail. 
“We won’t be able to offer any ad* 
vice, with that thing listening. Oh. 
stay sharp, Del boy!” 

“To simplify matters,” said the 
berserker. “I will move first in ev- 
ery game.” 

D el could look forward to another 
hour free of the mind-weapon 
when he finished rigging the check- 
er board When the pegged pieces 
were moved, appropriate signals 
would be radioed to the berserker; 
lighted squares on the board would 
show him where its pieces were 
moved. If it spoke to him while 
the mindweapon was on. Del’s voice 
would answer from a tape, which 
he had stocked with vaguely agres- 
sive phrases, such as: “Get on with 
the game ” or “Do you want to 
give up now?” 

He hadn’t told the enemy how 
far along he was with his prepara- 
tions because he was still busy with 
something the enemy must not 
know — the system that was going 
to enable Newton to play a game of 
simplified checkers 

Del gave a soundless little laugh 
as he worked, and glanced over to 
where Newton was lounging on his 
couch, clutching toys in his hands as 
it he drew some comfort from them. 
This scheme was going to push the 
ai\an near the limit of his ability, 
but Del saw no reason why it should 
fail 

Del had completely analyzed the 

102 



miniature checker-game, and dia- 
grammed every position that New- 
ton could possibly face — playing 
only even-numbered moves, thank 
the random berserker for that speci- 
fication! — on small cards. Del had 
discarded some lines of play that 
would lead from some poor early 
moves by Newton, further simpli- 
fying his job. Now, on, a card show- 
ing each possible remaining position, 
Del indicated the best possible move 
with a drawn-in arrow. Now he 
could quickly teach Newton to play 
the game by looking at the appro- 
priate card and making the move 
shown by the arrow. The system was 
not perfect, but — 

“Oh, oh,” said Del, as his hands 
stopped working and he stared into 
space. Newton whined at the tone 
in his voice. 

Once Dal had sat at one board 
in a simultaneous chess exhibition, 
one of sixty players opposing the 
world champion, Blankenship. Del 
had held his own into the middle 
game. Then, when the great man 
paused again opposite his board, 
Del had shoved a pawn forward, 
thinking he had reached an unas- 
sailable position and could begin a 
counterattack. Blankenship had 
moved a rook to an innocent-looking 
square and strolled on to the next 
board — and then Del had seen the 
checkmate coming at him, four 
moves away but one move too late 
for him to do anything about it. 

T he Commander suddenly said a 
foul phrase in a loud distinct 
voice. Such conduct was extremely 




rare, and the Second Officer looked 
around in surprise. “What?” 

“I think we’ve had it.” The Com- 
mander paused. “I hoped that Mur- 
ray could set up some kind of system 
over there, so that Newton could 
play the game — or appear to be 
playing it. But it won’t work. What- 
ever system Newton plays by rote 
will always have him thinking the 
same move in the same position. It 
may be a perfect system — but a 
man doesn’t play any game that 
way, damn it. He makes mistakes, 
he changes strategy. Even in a game 
this simple there’ll be room for that. 
Most of all, a man learns a game as 
he plays it He gets better as he goes 
along. That’s what’ll give Newton 
away, and that’s what our bandit 
wants. It’s probably heard about 
aiyans. Now as soon as it can be 
sure it’s facing a dumb animal over 
there, and not a man or computer.” 

After a little while the Second Of- 
ficer said: “I’m getting signals of 
their moves. They’ve begun play. 
Maybe we should’ve rigged up a 
board so we could follow along with 
the game.” 

“We better just be ready to go 
at it when the time comes.” The 
Commander looked hopelessly at his 
salvo button, and then at the clock 
that showed two hours must pass 
before Gizmo could reasonably be 
hoped for. 

Soon the Second Officer said: 
“That seems to be the end of the 
first game; Del lost it, if I’m reading 
their scoreboard signal right.” He 
paused. “Sir, here’s that signal we 
picked up the last time it turned 



the mindbeam on. Del must be start- 
ing to get it again.” 

There was nothing for the Com- 
mander to say. The two men waited 
silently for the enemy’s attack, hop- 
ing only that they could damage it 
in the seconds before it would over- 
whelm them and kill them. 

“He’s playing the second game,” 
said the Second Officer, puzzled. 
“And I just heard him say ‘Let’s 
get on with it.’” 

“His voice could be recorded. He 
must have made some plan of play 
for Newton to follow; but it won’t 
fool the berserker for long. It can’t.” 
Time crept unmeasurably past 
them. 

The Second said: “He’s lost the 
first four games. But he’s not mak- 
ing the same moves every time. I 
wish we’d made a board ...” 
“Shut up about the board I We’d 
be watching it instead of the panel. 
Now stay alert, Mister.” 

After what seemed a long time, 
the Second said: “Well, I’ll be!” 
“What?” 

“Our side got a draw in that 
game.” 

“Then the beam can’t be on him. 
Are you sure ...” 

“It is! Look, here, the same indi- 
cation we got last time. It’s been 
on him the better part of an hour 
now, and getting stronger.” 

The Commander stared in disbe- 
lief; but he knew and trusted his 
Second’s ability. And the panel in- 
dications were convincing. He said: 
“Then someone — or something — 
with no functioning mind is learning 
how to play a game, over there. 



103 




Ha, ha,” he added, as if trying to 
remember how to laugh. 

T ie berserker won another game 
Another draw. Another win tor 
the enemy. Then three drawn games 
In a row. 

Once the Second Officer heard 
Del’s voice ask coolly: “Do you 
want to give up now?” On the next 
move he lost another game. But the 
following game ended in another 
draw. Del was plainly taking more 
time than his opponent to move, 
but not enough to make the enemy 
impatient. 

“It’s trying different modulations 
on the mindbeam,” said the Second. 
“And it’s got the power turned way 
up.” 

"Yeah,” said the Commander. 
Several times he had almost tried 
to radio Del, to say something that 
might keep the man’s spirits up — 
and also to relieve his own feverish 
inactivity, and try to find out what 
could possibly be happening now. 
But be could not take the chance. 
Any interference might upset the 
miracle. 

He could not believe the inexplic- 
able success could last, even when 
the checker match turned gradually 
into an endless succession of drawn 
games between two perfect players. 
Hours ago* the Commander had said 
good-by to life and hope, and he 
stiir waited for the fatal moment. 
And he waited. 

“ — not perish from the Earth!” 
said Del Murray, and Newton’s 

104 



eager hands flew to loose his right 
arm from its shackle. 

A game, unfinished on the little 
board before him, had been aban- 
doned seconds earlier. The mind- 
beam had been turned off at the 
same time, when Gizmo had burst 
into normal space right in position 
and only five minutes late; and the 
berserker had been forced to turn 
all its energies to meet the immedi- 
ate all-out attack of Gizmo and 
Foxglove. 

Del saw his computers, recovering 
from the effect of the beam, lock his 
aiming screen onto the berserker’s 
scarred and bulging midsection, as 
he shot his right arm forward, scat- 
tering pieces from the game board. 

“Checkmate!” he roared out 
hoarsely, and brought his fist down 
on the big red button. 

4 4Tm glad it didn’t want to play 
1 chess,” Del said later, talking 
to Commander in Foxglove’s cabin. 
“I could never have rigged that up.” 
The ports were cleared now, and 
the men could look out at the cloud 
of expanding gas, still faintly lumin- 
ous, that had been a berserker; metal 
fire- purged of the legacy of ancient 
evil. 

But the Commander was watching 
Del. “You got Newt to play by 
following diagrams, I see that. But 
how could he learn the game?” 

Del grinned. “He couldn’t. But 
his toys could. Now wait before you 
slug me.” He called the aiyan to him 
and took a small box from the ani- 
mal’s hand. The box rattled faintly 




as he held it up. On the cover was 
pasted a diagram of one possible po- 
sition in the simplified checker game, 
with a different-colored arrow indi- 
cating each possible move of Del’s 
pieces.” 

“It took a couple hundred of 
these boxes,” said Del. “This one was 
in the group that Newt examined for 
the fourth move. When he found 
a box with a diagram matching the 
position on the board, he picked 
the box up, pulled out one of these 
beads from inside, without looking 
— that was the hardest part to teach 
him in a hurry, by the way,” said 
Del, demonstrating. “Ah, this one’s 
blue. That means, make the move 
indicated on the corner by a blue 
arrow. Now the orange arrow leads 
to a poor position. See?” Del shook 
all the beads out of the box into 
his hand. “No orange beads left; 
there were six of each color when 
we started. But every time Newton 
drew a bead, he had orders to leave 
it out of the box until the game 
was over. Then, if the scoreboard 
indicated a loss for our side, he went 
back and threw away all the beads 
he had used. All the bad moves 
were gradually eliminated. In a few 
hours, Newt and his boxes learned to 
play the game perfectly.” 

“Well,” said the Commander. He 
thought for a moment, then reached 
down to scratch Newton behind the 
ears. “I never would have come up 
with that idea.” 



“I should have thought of if 
sooner. The basic idea’s a couple of 
centuries old. And computers are 
supposed to be my business.” 

“This could be a big thing,” said 
the commander. “I mean your basic 
idea might be useful to any task 
force that has to face a berserker’s 
mindbeam.” 

“Yeah.” Del grew reflective. 
“Also ...” 

“What?” 

“I was thinking of a guy I met 
once. Named Blankenship. I wonder 
if I could rig something up . ”

CAPTAIN 
of the 

KALI 

By Gary Wright 



illustrated by Giunta 



106 



Sail down the wind, Kali! 
Victory waits across the 
seas — and so does death! 



J ohn Ward, God Helper, hung in 
his chair like a damp, empty uni- 
form. An open, four-foot port show- 
ed a circle of blazing blue sky and a 
regular glimpse of a high, curving 
topsail. The humid, hot salty flavor 
of a strange sea blanketed the cabin, 
and sparked a sudden thought: 
“What the hell am I doing here?” 
There was no prompt answer. The 
wind rushed and moaned. The roil- 
ing water crashed and hissed under 
the stern. The following ship heaved 
its topsail into sight again, and with- 
drew it. A lilting chant drifted like 
smoke on the wind. 

We .ride the wind down like 
sleek, skimming birds. 

The seething foam furrows fol- 
low true . 

The sky is clouded with our 
singing sails. 

We ride the wind down , down 
the wind . 

He was Comet Colonel John 
Ward, Terran Confederation, Earth; 
he was certain of that. Age? Forty- 



two, more or less. Specialty? His- 
torical Naval Tactician. If you had 
to call it something you might as 
well call it that. Hobby? Sailing. But, 
God, Snipes and Lightnings aren’t 
ships-of-the-line! Reading? Well. 
lyric poetry and ancient history, if 
you must know. Present Occupation? 
God Helper. No, call that Comman- 
der Advisor to the Kali, Aqua. Fut- 
ure? Oh, hell-yes; right up the . 

Wide shouldered, wave explod- 
ing, trim twin-hulled we come . 
First , the sky tall , fine first- 
liners. 

Then the seconds, flanking fast. 
Lean and level slide the frig- 
ates. 

All around us flash the cor- 
vettes. 

Ride the wind down, Kali sea- 
men, down the wind to Ande- 
Ke. 

Six months ago he had a future 
all outlined, but six months ago he 
was a shining God Helper, come in 
glory. Now he was simply a God 



107 




Helper, and sometimes oot even 
that. 

We are the Kali The fortunate 
ones. Yes ! 

Heirs to our wind and water 
world. 

Like our ships we are tall and 
proud. 

Like our wind we are wild and 
restless. 

Like our sea we are strong and 
savage. 

This is our world , wide and 
lonely. 

Ride the wind down , Kali broth- 
ers , down the wind to Anda - 
Ke. 

S ix months on this barely discov- 
ered, one per cent land area, be- 
hind-the-galaxy planet, with piercing 
Conferedation insight: Aqua. Where 
the land was scattered about like 
pepper on an egg, and even the wind 
tried to run backwards 

Down the wind at Anda-Ke— 
there is trouble. 

There we meet the stupid Grim - 
nal. 

There the challenging, grov- 
eling Grimnal. 

He wilt plead for his wives and 
children. 

Ana, as proper Kali seamen , 
We will keep them soft and 
happy. 

After, we send their men away , 
Under the hungry gray-green 
water; 

Under the wind as we ride the 
wind down , down the wind to 
victory. 

And here he still was, trying to 
show some life-loving, song-singing, 

108 



battle-mad, contrary-thinking, con- 
ceived of leather and salt spray* five- 
foot humanoids how to fight a sea 
war. 

And that was really quite a joke. 
The Kali and the Grimnal had been 
at this for a hundred years, and do- 
ing quite well. They were in no dan- 
ger of getting overpopulated for one 
thing, and had evolved a dual power 
political system over the entire plan- 
et before the invention of an explo- 
sive. But now, being newly discov- 
ered by bigger and better dual pow- 
ers. they were being shown how to 
fight in a bigger and better way. 
Only the Grimnal seemed to be 
learning, however. Oh, the Kali lis- 
tened, and even followed directions, 
but they seemed incapable of under- 
standing that slamming two corvettes 
upwind into the guns of eight first- 
liners was simply not good military 
tactics. 

They had a game. Something like 
Tag in reverse. One man was It, and 
everyone on ship tried to catch him. 
He could go anywhere, do anything, 
even cut the rigging as long as it 
didn’t endanger the ship. The more 
daring he. was, the better. Ward had 
watched one make a hundred and 
fifty foot dive from a skysail yard 
with the ship making about twenty 
knots in a heavy sea. How do you 
go about explaining caution to a 
people like that? 

B ut he had to. Somehow. Since 
the big boys had taken sides the 
Kali had been losing. Or, more ac- 
curately, Ward had been losing. 

Alt the Gods are busy Beings . 
We know. 

But even They have noticed 
now , 




Ward’s wandering mind snapped 
back. This was a new verse. 

And sent a sky man down to 
help us; 

Sent a Helper down to lead us. 
But the ways of Gods are 
strange. 

The Grimnal leaps from isle to 
island , 

While the Kali stand and watch 
him. 

While the Gods and Helpers 
falter. 

Ride the wind down , Kali 
brothers. At Anda-Ke we stand 
the test. 

A polite cough from behind re- 
minded him that Captain Tahn was 
still in the cabin. The Kali coughed 
to express anything from rage to 
sheer joy, and this one probably 
meant that Ward’s hearing the last 
verse was an accident. Ward swung 
around and glanced at him, but the 
Kali deliberately kept his slitted eyes 
on the chart before him. Ward was 
reminded again of the Kali likeness 
to the long vanished American In- 
dian: black, straight hair; narrowed, 
snapping black eyes; high, angular 
cheek bones. But not much beyond 
that. If you took a fine featured 
Sioux of long ago . shortened 
him about a foot, thinned him down 
— bones and all, raised his shoulders 
to a perpetual shrug, stretched his 
arms so that they still reached his 
hips, then starved him for a month 
. .you might be close. But if you 
took a picture of him then, and look- 
ed at it slightly sideways, you would 
almost have it. An extremely thin, 
short, shrugging strip of muscled 
rawhide. 

Tahn coughed again; the your-at- 



tention-please cough. He swung a 
chart around for Ward to see. It was 
a rough drawing of Anda-Ke, the 
largest of the Grimnal Group, and 
more or less the home island. It 
looked somewhat like a startled ele- 
phant: mouth open, trunk arced out 
at an angle. The mouth was Anda 
Bay, and was guarded by Anda Pas- 
sage where the lower lip came with- 
in two miles of the upper. The trunk 
was Pelo Head, and was broken 
about halfway down by Pelo Break. 
The area between the drooping trunk 
and the neck was the Grimnal Sea. 
It was into this that the Kali fleet 
was charging like a peanut sailing 
for the mouth. 

Tahn tapped a pencil-like finger 
at the rearmost reach of Anda Bay. 

“nphere,” he said, in the Kali-Con- 
-L federation mixture they found 
to be the shortest distance between 
two cultures. “Anchored there like 
marks on a sail. Feeling so safe in 
their home. Thinking we do not dare 
come after them. Grimnal rafts just 
waiting to go to the bottom.” 

“And the gliders?” Ward asked. 
“Are they returned? We have no in- 
formation but the tales of two na- 
tives.” 

Tahn glanced at a water trick- 
ling, time-measuring device hang- 
ing from the overhead. 

“Soon the gliders return, but. ” 
He shrugged, somehow. 

“And those are not rafts,” Ward 
went on. “The natives said three, 
two and single gun rows. That 
means first and second-liners, frig- 
ates and probably corvettes. And 
they said ‘many,’ which means any- 
where from fifty to two hundred.” 
Tahn coughed his agreement. 
“But with Grimnal stupidity,” he 

109 




said, “they can do no more than run 
around in terror as we shell the city 
and fire their ships We have this 
won.” 

Ward looked down at his hands, 
oaught a deep breath, and contin- 
ued. 

“1 have said before. We are not 
fighting just the Grimnal. We are 
fighting God Helpers too. Men like 
myself have come to help the Grim- 
nal.” He caught Than’s flickering 
glance and added quickly, '‘Men 
who are probably better fighters 
than I am.” 

Tahn coughed and leaned his 
head sideways, fairly equivalent to 
a casual ‘so what?’ 

“False Gods. False Helpers,” he 
said. 

Ward held his breath and swung 
back to face the port. Great, sizzling 
Hell! He wondered if his opposite 
with the Grimnal had such prob- 
lems. Probably not. Problems 
weren’t allowed in the United Peace 
Worlds. And with the Grimnal pre- 
ference for island life over the sea, 
it apparently took little urging to 
make them want all the islands in 
the world 

“You realize,” Ward said without 
turning, ‘that they have probably 
known ot our coming for days.” 

“Good.” 

“And what would they still be 
doing at anchor?” 

Cough, cough. Probably meaning 
how the hell should 1 know? 

II 

I t only they didn't have this tower- 
ing independency and conceit, 
Ward thought They used to fight as 
individual ships Then chev weren’t 
the least surprised it a lonely frig- 
ate was blown to splinters by aD ov- 

110 



erwhelming Grimnal force. In fact, 
it was a thing of joy and beauty for- 
ever. 

It was only by the very fiercest 
thundering had he gotten this fleet 
together under Tahn, and only 
Tahn’s high position had kept it to- 
gether. And God only knew how 
much longer it would hold together. 
The Grimnal had shown remarkable 
organization. Ward had pointed 
that out, and that was a gross mis- 
take 

The Kali wanted nothing to do 
with what the Grimnal did. 

A sharp rap sounded on the cab- 
in door and a Kali slipped in. He 
made the casual motion that could 
be a salute, a greeting or a wave 
good-by, depending on circumstan- 
ces. 

“Two gliders return,” he said hap- 
pily. “In the bay are two first-lin- 
ers, four second-liners, five frigates 
and some corvettes. All at anchor. 
Just waiting for us.” 

Ward nodded. 

“How many corvettes?” 

The Kali’s face wrinkled in dis- 
may. 

“Fifty-six,” he said softly. 

Ward smiled to himself, and ran 
the Kali fleet by in his mind. 

Eighteen first-liners mounting a 
hundred-twenty guns apiece. Eleven 
second -liners mounting eighty to 
ninety guns. Twenty-four frigates 
mounting fifty to sixty guns. Fifty- 
two corvettes mounting ten to twen- 
ty guns A strong force, but not as 
strong as the Grimnal potential. 
Firmly, he said: 

“We will run down almost to An- 
da Passage — then wait.” 

The Kali glanced at each other. 
Tahn coughed 

“Not to go in?” 




“No!” 

“Why?” 

Ward took a deep breath and told 
himself to stay calm. 

“We know there are land guns 
along the Passage. We know that 
even without them three first-liners 
could hold it against anything. We 
know that those ships in the bay are 
not the whole fleet. Where are the 
rest?” 

Double cough. Double head bob. 
Two helpless expressions. 

“We outnumber,” Tahn said 
hopefully. 

Ward muffled a smile. At least 
they were learning something. 

“We cannot go in, Tahn. It’s a 
trap.” 

Tahn was quiet, his whole body 
slowly coming to what Ward knew 
was hurt pride and anger. 

“Then we wait?” 

“We wait.” 

Tahn was nearly rigid, his voice 
fighting its cage of control. 

“We wait like before?” 

I t was Ward’s turn to let a tingling 
moment pass. This was the first 
overt mention of his past actions. 
He must walk softly. Kali temper 
was like nitroglycerine; one touch 
the wrong way . 

“We wait only to learn of the oth- 
er Grimnal ships,” he said evenly. 
“We let them make the first move 
in order to see what they are doing. 
Then we strike — hard!” 

After a long, breathless moment, 
Tahn coughed. It was one that Ward 
never heard before, but judging by 
sound, it was not meant to be pleas- 
ant. Ward stood up, stared direct- 
ly at Tahn and said quietly “I charge 
you with honesty, Tahn.” 

It was a serious phrase. Tahn 



made the equivalent of a nod. 

“There is much talk,” he began, 
his voice higher pitched. “We ask 
ourselves why we do not fight. The 
Grimnal takes many islands; land 
that is ours. He does not defeat us, 
but we do not stop him. We wait 
as you tell us. We wait and see our 
islands lost. 

“The Kali are ashamed, and the 
Grimnal laughs. We cannot go home 
and face our women and children. 

“You come to show us how to 
fight, you say. But we do not fight. 
We wait. You tell us things that will 
make us win, but we do not fight. 
We wait. You hold us back. We ask 
ourselves why.” 

He straightened, obviously grab- 
bing a big piece of Kali courage. 

“There is an answer why. Perhaps 
you help other Gods than ours. 
Or — perhaps you are afraicf.” 

There it was. Stark and ugly. 
Ward looked at Tahn for a long 
time, then straightened to his full 
five-eleven. 

“As a God Helper I am charged 
with honesty at all times,” he said, 
and let it sink in for a second. 

“I see many more things than the 
surface of the sea and the direction 
of the wind. What I do for the Kali 
is for the good of the»Kali. If you 
follow me, you go to victory. If you 
do not follow, you go to the bot- 
tom.” 

The Kali glared with glittering 
eyes. Tahn’s cough was a bark. 

“Perhaps some will follow.” 

Their parting salute was crisp as 
they spun and left. 

Ward eased himself back to the 
chair and stared at the door. This 
was the ragged edge. They fight the 
one coming, or else . And if 
they lost it, the Confederation 

111 




could mark off the Kali, John Ward 
and the planet. 

He remembered all too clearly the 
other engagements, if you would call 
them that. And he remembered too 
the disappointment, chagrin and out- 
right anger of the Kali, and his own 
frustration. 

E ngagement One: Taley Point. 

They had surprised a small 
Grimnal force close in to shore on 
the leeward side. After trading shots 
at extreme range. Ward gave the 
order to withdraw. Reasons? Shal- 
lows, reefs, a raising wind, and 
nightfall The Grimnal was gone in 
the morning. The Kali had been 
stunned. It was the first time they 
had ever withdrawn with whole 
ships. 

Engagement Two: Gola Island. 
They had chased a smaller force into 
port, but Ward had held off because 
of intense shore fire. The Kali did 
not sing for three days. 

Engagement Three: Bari Sea. 

They were closing with a nearly 
equal force, yet out of range, when 
a large wind devil, one of the freak, 
contrary winds, had slashed across 
both fleets; shredding sails, splinter- 
ing masts, effectively crippling both 
forces. Ward gave the order to 
heave to and repair damages, as the 
Grimnal did the same. The Kali 
were astonished. Such a thought was 
madness with the enemy in sight. 
But they followed orders, and did 
not smile when he appeared any 
more, 

' Engagement Four: Darel Sea. 

(Oh, the Darel Sea!) They were 
closing at glider range when a lucky 
Grimnal had sneaked in and manag- 
ed to fire bomb a first-liner. With- 
out that ship they were greatly out- 

112 



gunned and, leaving a frigate to take 
off the crew, they slipped off down- 
wind. It was a near rebellion, but 
Tahn had held them. Then the wind 
came up, bringing the Grimnal force 
with it. And both the frigate and the 
burning first went down fighting. 
The Kali had cried, probably, Ward 
thought, more in admiration than in 
sadness. 

And now, as a result of a vote of 
ships’ captains, they were headed 
straight for the GrimnaFs heart; 
and Ward wondered* if he was any- 
thing more than a passenger. He 
knew he had been tactically right in 
each case, but the Kali knew he 
was morally wrong. So who had it, 
the head or the heart? 

And what about this thing of be- 
ing afraid? That hurt. He didn’t be- 
lieve he was afraid. Honestly, he 
really couldn’t say. He had, as a 
fact, never fought a battle in his 
life. 

H e used to play a game in the 
scouts. What did they call it? 
Capture the Flag, or something like 
that. Each side had a hidden flag 
and the other tried to get it. He was 
always the planner. How’ll we do it, 
John? And he would tell them, and 
keep away from the rough stuff, 
and they nearly always won. 

But violence fascinated him as a 
spectator. Later his reading took him 
in that direction, and later still his 
studies. In the middle of his life he 
found he was one of the leading his- 
torical naval tacticians in the world. 
He started writing historical novels, 
under a pseudonym, of course, and 
soon became the world’s authority. 

Then someone blundered into 
Aqua. 

For a couple hundred years the 




Terran Confederation and the Unit- 
ed Peace Worlds had been at war. 
Not an open, honest, stand-up-and 
get-it war; but an undercover, half 
ignored, let’s- get- the - kids - to-fight 
war. A galaxywide game, played for 
planets, using local cultures. And 
always according to the rules. No 
new technologies. No new weapons. 
Use what you have at hand. Play it 
fair. Because if you do not, neither 
will we — and together we will eli- 
minate the universe. 

Aqua was a natural. It had a war 
already underway. Deep in the se- 
cretmost catacombs of Confedera- 
tion Central a voice said: “Find a 
man who knows ancient naval tac- 
tics. Find a man who knows sailing. 
Find a man who knows combustion 
firearms. Find a man. Now!” 

And the order went rattle-rattle, 
click-click, wink, blink . and 
reached out and touched Doctor 
John Ward. 

Although Colonel Ward’s training 
had filled three straight days, there 
was one thing they forgot to tell him 
— what do you think about, really, 
when someone fires a cannon in 
your face? 

A knock came at the door. Ward 
rubbed his face back into an expres- 
sion of awareness. 

“Come.” 

Tahn entered briskly and strode 
to the opposite side of the table. His 
eyes held a level, challenging look. 

“Gliders say there are Grimnal 
coming up behind us along the coast. 
About — uh — two hours distant.” 

“How many?” 

“There are four firsts, five sec- 
onds, twelve frigates and some cor- 
vettes.” 

Ward patiently tapped the table. 

“How many corvettes?” 



“Twenty-three.” 

Ward was thoughtful for a mo- 
ment. 

“We still have them. But it still 
is not their whole force.” 

“We hit them?” 

I’d better answer this one right, 
he told himself. They were now just 
below Pelo Break, about two hours 
from the Passage. There was about 
an hour of daylight left: 

“After the sun dies,” he said, 
avoiding the word “wait,” “we will 
swing to meet this new force. If the 
wind holds straight and steady, we 
will come across to them like sharks 
in the night.” 

“Sharks?” 

Ward grinned. 

“A very savage deep sea fish of 
my world.” 

Tahn relaxed, and a twisted smile 
came over his narrow face. 

“It will be a short fight,” he said 
softly. 

m 

A qua’s sizzling sun was getting 
hazy as it settled behind lower 
Pelo Head, outlining the violent 
peaks like teeth in some savage jaw. 
Ward stood on the bridge of the 
first-liner, Bad Weather , and watch- 
ed the fleet and the late returning 
gliders. He never failed to marvel at 
these ships — sleek, sea-flying cata- 
marans, steady, tall and wonderous- 
ly beautiful. Their twin hulls skim- 
med the seas with hardly a roll. 
Their speed was something you had 
to feel to believe. 

He watched the second-liner. 
South Bird , come around to catch 
her glider. 

Both soaring upwind, they aimed 
for an intersection. As they drew 

113 




closer, two long booms with netting 
between were extended over the 
stern. Slowly they angled together. 
When it appeared that the glider 
would crash the bridge it pulled up, 
stalled and fell softly into the net. 

He never failed to exhale a long 
breath after such a landing — catch- 
ing, rather. 

Launching was even more spec- 
tacular. The ship raced out on fast 
beam reach with its glider poised 
upwind on its two poles. Then a 
streaking corvette hissed up under 
the stern, swung slightly upwind, 
caught the braided stretch-line and 
actually yanked the glider aloft. 
Ward was quite sure it was some- 
thing he never wanted to try 

The Bad Weather was coming 
around now. He caught the white 
flash of her glider high downwind. 
Tahn came to stand by him, his 
quick, cat-like motions betraying his 
eagerness 

“They bring more news,” he grin- 
ned. “The Grimnal in Anda Bay is 
starting to raise sail.” 

Ward frowned. 

“They think to trap us between 
them Perhaps they expect us to race 
into the Passage after dark ” 

Tahn coughed his pleased cough. 

“But our — uh — tactics, is it? 
They are to keep out of the Pas- 
sage?” 

Ward smiled. 

“For now We fight them as two 
separate* fights, not as one We will 
overwhelm each in turn.” 

* Tahn’s cough was one of agree- 
ment. 

“Yes,” he breathed “Just as long 
as we fight ” 

They turned to watch the glider 
make its long floating approach It 
had dumped its spoilers and was 

114 



losing altitude, when it suddenly 
climbed impossibly fast, spun com- 
pletely around and exploded in a 
hundred pieces. 

T ahn leaped to the rail, stared, 
then keened the Kali howl of 
alarm. Ward squinted downwind in 
puzzlement, then saw it — the seeth- 
ing, wild slice of a wind devil arcing 
toward the fleet. 

Curling, lashing, faster than any 
ship, it bore down x>n them in a 
track of boiling foam. Other ships 
took up the cry. Knives flashed as 
sheets were cut and sails crashed 
down. Seamen ran aloft to furl the 
wild cloth. Some of the leading cor- 
vettes tried to turn and run out of 
the way, but the wind was too fast. 

A corvette suddenly lifted her 
bows, flipped over backwards and 
slammed down like a thrown stone. 
A frigate lost her sails and masts in 
less than two seconds. Another cor- 
vette rose sideways on one hull, 
spun and broke in two. The wind 
shriek became deafening. 

Another frigate lost its masts, lift- 
ed on its stern and fell back in an 
explosion of water. The first-liner, 
Thunder , lost its masts and rigging, 
put its bows down as if stepped on, 
spun a full ninety degrees and final- 
ly relaxed. A corvette went tumbling 
end over end into the side of a sec- 
ond liner, which immediately lost its 
masts and half its bridge. A corvette 
went streaking out of the fleet at 
blinding speed, one hull hiked en- 
tirely out of the water, and disap- 
peared in a wall, of spray. 

It was abruptly silent. 

The foaming wind track left the 
fleet and slashed toward the open 
sea With a soft flutter, then a breeze, 
the westerly quietly resumed its 




“How slow?” 



push. The Kali appeared on deck 
again and slowly gazed about them. 
And the fleet lay dead in the water. 

Ships lay heading in all directions. 
Wreckage, lines and bits of sail lit- 
tered the water. A frigate lay listed 
hard over. Damage reports were 
coming in to the Bad Weather : the 
Thunder dismasted and leaking; an- 
other first dismasted; one second 
leaking badly, perhaps going down; 
three other seconds dismasted; one 
frigate sinking fast; two more dis- 
masted and leaking; two more dis- 
masted; six corvettes lost; four dis- 
masted and damaged. 

Tahn was grim as he scratched 
marks on a slate. Twenty-one ships 
out of action in less than a minute. 
Ward cursed and slammed the rail. 
Damned planet! Damned Grimnal! 
Damned everything! Tahn coughed 
beside him. And damned coughing! 

“There is more news,” Tahn said 
quietly. “We just fished out a glider 
flyer who had returned from cruis- 
ing Pelo Head.” 

Ward turned. There seemed to be 
a smile flickering on Tahn’s swarthy 
face. 

“He says there is a great Grimnal 
force coming into the Break from 
the north. Sixteen firsts, eighteen 
seconds and ten frigates. There are 
no corvettes.** 

Ward’s whole body seemed to 
tighten. Thanks to a damned wind 
the trap was sprung. 

“Can they come through the 
Break?” he asked, more to stall for 
time thaiv gain information, lahn 
coughed three times. 

“It is a brave thing to do Even 
for Kali it would be brave. It is bad 
water in the Break. The wind goes 
up: the current comes down. It is 
slow, but it can be done.” 

1 U 



T ihn tilted his head, stared at 
where the slice of the Break 
was barely visible on the horizon, 
and shrugged, almost. 

“Maybe — uh — two hours. May- 
be more.” He coughed. “Maybe 
less.” 

Ward glared at the crippled ships. 
“And they would try it at night?** 
Tahn coughed assent. 

“There will be a good moon. I 
would try it.” 

Damn. Forces from three sides 
that, united, would blow them right 
out of the water. They could meet 
any of them alone, but . 

“If we could slip south,” he pdn- 
dered aloud, “we could — ” 

Tahn snarled, his face an unearth- 
ly mask in the dimming light. His 
breath whistled between his teeth. 

“You polastil” he hissed. Ward 
straightened and faced him. The 
Kali around froze in their tracks. 
Polasti was the foulest word in their 
language. 

“Kali have died in this water just 
now,” Tahn was barely able to man- 
age his voice. “They are down there 
right now. We will not run and dis- 
grace them! We will stand here. We 
will put a wall of sails and guns 
around this spot, and if we die it 
will be in honor. We will run no 
more. We will run no moref 
He was trembling when he finish- 
ed, and Ward expected a knife to 
make one final arc. It was impos- 
sible to try to explain. It was 
broken . 

That thought crashed through as 
a knife never could. 

It’s over. The Grimnal will sur- 
round this pitiful fleet like a storm. 
It*s over; we’ve lost the fight, the 




war and the planet. And I’ve done it. 
It’s my baby. 

The thing seared him, roared 
through him, shook him — and 
touched a secret place. A deep place 
where he stored his anger. All his 
past angers, big and little; covered 
stifled, caught and hidden. Old hurts, 
old dreams, old reproaches scream- 
ed and gibbered through him like 
a thousand ghosts and devils. They 
swamped the gentle man. They 
dragged him down and gagged him. 
And something else took his place 
— something that had never been 
allowed to stand before. 

“You stupid bastards!” he roared, 
wheeling to face them all. “You 
God-forsaken fools! A Grimnal ba- 
by is a greater fighter than your 
bravest man. Look what he has done 
to you. Look! Like blind animals 
you have been led into a trap. You 
have been put in a cage of your own 
ignorance. You call me polasti! 1 am 
the only one who can show you how 
to win. The only thing you know is 
to bunch together and be killed like 
animals at slaughter. You stand to- 
gether in one tight group to make 
it easy for him. You know how it 
will be? Look!” 

He sprang to the glass globe that 
held the magnetized needle, seized 
it and hurled it to the deck. It ex- 
ploded like .a small bomb. The Kali 
moved back. 

“That is what the Grimnal will 
do to you. Your bravery will be as 
that glass, nice to see — but look 
at it now!” 

Water from the globe trickled 
slowly through the shattered glass. 
The chips winked red in the dying 
sun. Only the cry of the wind sound- 
ed through the ship. Ward forced his 
choking breath to an even rhythm. 



“Now go die like the fools you 
are.” 

He left the quiet bridge and 
threaded his way to his cabin. Night 
was coming softly to the Grimnal 
Sea. 

I t was dark in the cabin when the 
knock sounded. There was no 
answer, and it came again. 

“Come,” Ward said in a very tir- 
ed, hollow voice. 

The door swung open and some- 
one entered. After a long moment, 
Tahn’s voice came softly in the dark. 

“No one has ever spoken to the 
Kali like that.” 

Ward did not answer. 

“It is a brave man that can do 
that. And bravery is something we 
understand.” There was a silent mo- 
ment. Tahn coughed. “May I light 
the lamp?” 

Ward swung around in the chair. 
“Certainly.” 

Flint flicked on steel, a spark 
glowed, caught, and light wavered 
in the cabin. The two faced each 
other, Ward sagged low in the chair, 
the Kali by the lamp. Tahn coughed 
again. 

“There is a way?” 

Ward let a moment pass. 

“There is a way to try.” 
“Fighting?” 

“Yes, fighting.” 

Tahn paused the barest second. 
“Tell me.” 

IV 

T he frigate, Windsong, skimmed 
downward like a low, lean cloud. 
Behind her, vague in the dim moon- 
light, followed four more frigates 
and the skating corvettes. Before her, 
like a gate to hell, gaped the jagged 
mouth of Pelo Break. Ward leaned 



117 




against the bridge rail beside Resi, 
the scarred and battered captain of 
Windsong. 

“Keep close to the eastern side,” 
Ward said. “In the shadow of the 
cliffs, out of the moonlight.” 

Resi spoke softly to the helms- 
man. and the Windsong eased into 
the shadow Ward turned and watch- 
ed the following ships as, one by one, 
they slipped out of the moon and 
all but vanished. He swung back and 
squinted ahead. As far as he could 
see, high, broken cliffs reared straight 
from the water on both sides, an- 
gling together in the distance. There 
Tahn had said, they stood a scant 
two hundred yards apart, and the 
Break turned nearly sixty degrees to 
the west. That was the narrows. 
Ward turned to Resi, wondering if 
the old Kali fully understood the 
plan. 

“If we do not meet them before, 
we wait for them at the narrows.” 

There was no acknowledgement 
that he could tell. Not even a cough. 
He doesn’t like this, Ward thought. 
He relishes the fight coming, but not 
me. Despite Tahn’s heated pep talk, 
I am a bad totem. But Tahn had ac- 
complished one thing — an honor 
promise from each ship’s captain to 
follow orders. Ward knew they 
would, as long as everything went 
along with fighting, but the moment 
something went wrong 

He remembered Tahn’s bark of 
surprise as the, plan unfolded Then 
the argument, and his own firm 
stand that he command this force. 
For this "was the crucial contact. The 
Key. If this tailed — it all failed. 

He was sure that Tahn and the 
rest of the feverishly anxious Kali 
would more than whip their end. 
They were outnumbered, but had an 

118 



overwhelming firepower edge. For 
the hundredth time he reviewed the 
thing, looking for the fatal flaw. 

One frigate for the crippled ships, 
which gave them quite a bit of fire- 
power right there. Two firsts, four 
seconds, five frigates (the Storm 
Bird had gone down) and four cor- 
vettes. They were to make fast re- 
pairs, jury rig, then stand by in the 
shadow at the mouth of Pelo Break. 
If the Kali came back out — fine; 
they would all rejoin Tahn. If not — 
and the Grimnal came — they were 
a last stand. 

Tahn had the main force of six- 
teen firsts, seven seconds and thir- 
teen frigates. He was to intercept 
the Grimnal coming from behind. 
He would run their fleet through, 
come about, rake them again and 
run out to sea. He was to hit them 
hard enough to stop them, then make 
them believe he was running away. 
After any pursuit was discouraged 
he was to come downwind and fly 
for Anda Passage. 

If the timing was right, he would 
run right over the force from the 
bay, and with a little effort clear 
them off the water. 

“Then,” Ward had added with a 
half smile, “you can shell the land 
guns in the Passage in your spare 
time. If the first Grimnal force 
comes limping in you shouldn’t have 
any trouble.” 

N o, Tahn wouldn’t have any 
trouble. In the Kali’s present 
mood they could probably do it with 
half their ships. 

But hell would be open in the 
Break tonight. Five slim frigates and 
forty-two tiny corvettes against six- 
teen firsts, eighteen seconds and ten 
frigates. Ship for ship; but what un- 




balanced firepower! Their advantage 
would be surprise, if nothing slip- 
ped, and maneuverability where the 
Grimnal ships would have their 
hands full just keeping clear of the 
cliffs. And this was the fulcrum. 

A sudden flare from the maindeck. 

“Cover that!” Resi snapped. Then 
to Ward, “They are cooking the 
liquor.” 

Ward nodded. Apparently Resi 
had a good idea of what was ex- 
pected. That was one good thing. 
The liquor, as they called it, was 
their explosive. A revolting, highly 
inflammable slime brewed of sea- 
weed and fats. It was prepared in 
port, but had to be brought to a 
firing temperature on board. This 
was done by heating in large kettles 
and kept just below boiling. When a 
gun was to be fired, a certain meas- 
ure of this soup was poured down 
the muzzle to a sizzling hot firing 
chamber, kept hot by a covered 
charcoal packing and quickly sealed 
by a lava-stone ball. It was the 
gunner’s sense of timing then to 
know when the gun was ready, and 
slam the firing stud with a hammer. 
This slapped flint to steel inside the 
chamber — and wham. 

But it was touchy. If the gunner 
swung too soon, nothing. If he wait- 
ed too long, it fired itself. If the 
chamber was too cool, it would not 
fire at all; if' too hot, it might go 
the second the ball was rammed. A 
very delicate operation. And in the 
midst of battle — with charcoal fly- 
ing, hot shot coming in, glowing 
fires under the kettles and spilled 
hot liquor everywhere — it was hard 
to see what kept a ship from blowing 
the whole battle apart. But that nev- 
er happened. The liquor was easily 
diluted with water, and they went 



into battle with special water crews 
sloshing down the decks. And the 
stuff was fast. In the Gola Island 
fight, with fairly hot guns, they were 
loading, aiming and firing in about 
ten seconds. 

The Windsong eased along, the 
narrows loomed closer and Ward 
began to tighten. Any second he^ex- 
pected the double bows of a Grim- 
nal first-liner to slide into, sight, fol- 
lowed by another, and another, and 
another . 

He felt the urge to move about, to 
do anything as long as he was mov- 
ing. He noticed the Kali were the 
same. They were as restless as the 
troubled waters of the Break — lung- 
ing, hissing, swirling, rocking up and 
down. They were constantly at the 
rail relieving themselves, or rattling 
the dipper at the water barrel. And 
he could see the glint ^of their eyes 
as they threw quick glances in his di- 
rection. He caught Resi watching 
too, and moved away. 

T hey didn’t trust him. They were 
waiting for him to call it off. 
They expected him to; probably 
wanting him to. 

He suddenly found he was quiver- 
ing like a captured bird. He gripped 
the rail hard with both hands to stop. 
But it wouldn’t stop. It galloped 
through him, ran him down and 
trampled him. And in panic he saw 
what it was. 

Fear. 

No simply the fear of failing. It 
was . 

God! The reality of it! This wasn’t 
like reading a book or writing a 
story. This was going to be real 
shot and flame instead of words and 
paper. Real people were going to die, 
with their blood warm and sticky 

119 




and horror in the eyes — and he 
wouldn’t be able to glance away to 
ponder it. It was going to roll from 
start to finish with the reality of 
Now and the surety of Death. It was 
going to flame as fights have flamed 
since something first snatched up a 
rock. And he was going to be right 
in the middle of it with these Kali, 
win or lose, live or die. And what 
was he doing here with these strange, 
alien Kali? 

He raised his head and glanced 
around. Resi was standing by the 
helmsman, talking with his deck 
lieutenant. Water splashed down on 
the maindeck; the water crews at 
work. There was a breathless quiet 
over the ship. He could see them 
standing like shadows, watching the 
curve of the narrows. 

The Spartans must have stood like 
that at the Pass of Thermopylae! 

And the Athenians on the Plains 
of Marathon. 

And the Americans at Bastogne. 

And men anywhere, any time be- 
fore a battle. 

A single, whispering line from 
an old poem sang through him: 

Into the Valley of Death rode 
the six hundred. 

There was no alien here but him- 
self. 

T 'he ominous walls of the narrows 
closed and filled the sky. Be- 
yond the curve, some two miles up, 
the Grimnal ships were slowly beat- 
ing upwind Suddenly, like a touch 
of fire to old ashes, he knew what 
he was doing here. A long impris- 
oned breath escaped from him, and 
a great sigh seemed to come from 
the whole ship. 

120 



Resi turned. Ward could barely 
make out what must be a smile in 
that old Kali face. 

“We made it, ho?” 

“Just barely, by God. Have the 
ships string out as planned, with the 
lead frigate in the tip of the shadow 
where the Break turns into the moon- 
light. And be careful of noise. It 
will carry in here like a cannon shot.” 

Resi coughed and was gone like 
a cat. 

The Windsong fell dead in the 
water. The others whispered past 
like ghosts. Voices called softly, and 
the small, shielded signal lights 
licked from ship to ship. And the 
Windsong was alone. Her bows 
swung out slightly to allow the fore- 
guns a field of fire. Ward climbed 
down from the bridge, strode the 
water-slick maindeck and gained the 
foredeck. The gun crews turned, 
glanced at him, then turned back. He 
could not tell if they were smiling 
or not. So what. They would have 
plenty to smile at in a moment. 

The lead first-liner was about a 
mile now and keeping well to their 
side. Ward squinted at the point of 
the shadow, but there was no light 
flickering there that he could see. 
Damn! 

The Grimnal ship looked huge in 
the moonlight, and the Break be- 
hind it seemed filled with sails. It 
was nearly abreast of the shadow tip, 
still holding to their side, and the 
tiniest flicker of light danced in the 
shadow beside it. Ward grinned. 
David and Goliath. 

The giant first-liner started its 
slow turn on the very edge of the 
shadow, drifting into the dark until 
only its sails held the moon. The 
sails came around, fluttered and filled. 
The silent hulls came into sight. 




Ward let out a breath, echoed by 
Resi. The lead liner was well on its 
new tack The next was starting to 
edge into the shadows, and behind 
that was another, and another, and 
another. Resi muffled a cough. 
“You tell when?” he whispered. 
Ward nodded. “I’ll tell when.” 
The Grimnal rode closer, the crash 
of its bow waves sounding louder. 
Ship after ship was coasting past 
the hidden frigate. Ward’s excite- 
ment grew to a pounding thing. They 
would be able to get them all in 
range. 

The sails towered over them. A 
hundred yards. Almost abreast; just 
at the narrowest point. Ward took a 
deep breath, and said quietly: 
“Now.” 

R esi turned and hissed. Steaming 
liquor trickled down hungry 
cannon mouths. Lava balls were 
softly rammed home. Muzzles came 
down. Aimed. The gunners tensed, 
raised their hammers — and swung. 
The night came apart. 

A crashing roar racketed through 
the Break. The walls blasted back 
the echo. The Windsong rocked and 
trembled. Smoke boiled into the 
moonlight and dimmed the Grimnal 
ship. And that was only a small 
sound. Over a mile of fire smashed 
from the shadow and for a quiver- 
ing second, it seemed the world had 
exploded. Then came the thunder, 
and Ward flinched. 

Waterspouts climbed in the moon- 
light, Wreckage spun from the Grim- 
nal ships. Holes splintered in their 
sides. The Windsong roared again; 
the bobbing corvettes answered. And 
a deafening, mind dulling thunder 
covered the break. 

And the Grimnal did not answer. 



The lightning flared steady now 
from the Kali line. Resi climbed half- 
way up the ratlines for a better look. 
And still the wounded giants had 
not answered. Grimnal were running 
in all directions on their decks. Resi 
let out a howl of sheer triumph. 

“They do not have their liquor 
cooked 1” he cried, swinging ta the 
deck. “We have them with cold 
guns!” 

The Kali cheered, and the firing 
seemed to cease. Ward was shaking 
again, but for a different reason. 

“Hey, Resi,” he bellowed. “Let’s 
get in there closer.” 

Sails snapped and the Windsong 
came alive. She seemed to leap into 
the moonlight. Then a corvette ap- 
peared beside her, and another, then 
two racing side by side into the 
smoke. And all the Kali were mov- 
ing. The Windsong’ s men were laugh- 
ing like children, and the water 
crews had everything soaked half- 
way up the mainsails. What people! 
Ward laughed, ducking another buc- 
ketful. Resi slid to a halt beside him. 
“We fool them, ho? We fool them!’ 
“Closer,” Ward yelled. “Under 
their guns!” 

“But they are not firing.” 

“Under their guns anyway,” Ward 
laughed, and added to himself — 
away boarders! A few scattered shots 
were coming from the Grimnal, rip- 
ping overhead. Ward stood a little 
taller. The Windsong came about, 
her starboard bow nearly slashing 
the looming first-liner Ward felt 
Resi’s hand on his arm. 

“It was really you that fool them.” 
Ward grinned foolishly. 

“But we whip them, ho?” 

Ward wanted to answer, but it 
was the starboard guns’ turn to speak.

IF • Short Story 



WHEN 

WHIRLYBIRDS 

CALL 

by Frank Banta 



T hose of the city of Featherton, 
on Grimes Planet, were with 
him to a man. Feathertonians cheer- 
ed and waved from their windows 
thar morning, not daring to come out 
for tear of the whirlybirds. and ad- 
miring Five-gun Charles DeCrabbe 
all the more for riding down the 
main stem of the town with the 
bubble of his convertible space coupe 
slid back — ignoring the menace from 
the skies. 

Five-gun Charles DeCrabbe rode 
down the exact center of the street, 
looking neither to right or left, not 
acknowledging the screams of adu- 
lation that poured from the windows. 
His bare head was up, his mouth 

122 



Five-Gun DeCrabbe was the 
terror of every planet — 
especially to his friends! 



was pressed into firm, haughty lines 
of self-confidence and even his bat- 
tle dress of dark green seemed to 
exude the aura of a competent killer. 

Five-gun Charles DeCrabbe had 
come to clean up the town. Of whir- 
lybirds. 

He stopped his space convertible 
in front of the white stone building 
titled City Hall on its facade. The 
two men waiting to greet him stayed 
safely under the bullet-shaped mar- 
quee as he alighted. He jumped over 
the side, checked his two holstered 
needle pistols, slung his explosive 
pellet rifle over one shoulder, his N- 
ray flashburn gun over the other 
shoulder and picked up his rocket- 



powered stun-gas spray gun in his 
hands. He strode over to the waiting 
men. 

“I’m Alson Prince, Mayor of 
Featherton,” said the older man 
shaking hands with the one De- 
Crabbe stuck out from under the 
spray gun. “And you are Five-gun 
Charles DeCrabbe?” 

“Yes yes yes!” exclaimed De- 
Crabbe impatiently in his clipped 
speech. 

“I’m the mayor’s son,” introduced 
the younger man with admiration 
shining in his eyes. “You sure look 
like you’re ready to whip those 
whirlybirds.” 

“Yes yes yes!” exclaimed De- 
Crabbe haughtily. “Always dislike 
long conversations you know. Sup- 
posing you tell me what you know 
so can exterminate them without 
further delay. No doubt solution be- 
fore dusk.” 

“Before dusk?” asked the mayor, 
dumfounded. “Oh, no, not today, 
I’m afraid. They’ve been around too 
many years to whip in one day.” 

“Perhaps shall require two days 
then,” said Five-gun Charles De- 
Crabbe graciously. “But doubt it. 
Tell me what you know of them.” 

4 4 T Tery well,” assented the older 
V man. “Perhaps the best place 
to begin is with their name. When 
we first occupied this planet, a bare 
twenty years ago, we called them 
wolfhawk-whirlybirds and tigerhawk- 
whirlybirds because they preyed on 
vicious animals. The whirlybirds 
were our best friends in those days. 
The only trouble is that they ran 



out of tigers and wolves to eat.” 
“Presumed they are now called 
peoplehawk-whirlybirds?” DeCrabbe 
frowningly asked in his clipped 
speech. 

“Exactly!” answered the older 
man. “Although that isn’t their full 
name. From the way they attack — ” 
“Most important,” interrupted 
Five-gun. “Give to me in detail.” 
“They prefer to attack strollers, 
although they have attacked on city 
streets when there is little traffic. 
They fly with amazing speed, con- 
sidering they are an untidy ball forty 
feet in diameter, and they are on 
top of their victims before the un- 
lucky ones are aware of the menace. 
Blowing their victims down with a 
rush of air from their feathers, they 
grab them up by the heels, carry 
them high aloft and drop them on 
piles of rock outside of town.” 
“They are downdraft- peoplehawk- 
whirlybirds then?” as*ked DeCrabbe. 

“That’s almost it,” agreed the 
mayor. “I have not yet told you of 
their cries. As they rise in tne air 
with the victim dangling from their 
talons by his heels, they utter a 
pleases ‘Coo! Coo!* like a gentle dove. 
That is why they are called Coocoo- 
downdraft-peoplehawk-whirlybirds.” 
“Approve of adequate names,” 
nodded Five-gun, unbending a trifle. 
“First step toward efficiency. Only 
one thing haven’t made clear. Pre- 
sumably have shotguns and rifles. 
Why unable drive off these preda- 
tors yourselves?” 

The mayor laughed bitterly. “It 
would be easy to tell you’d just ar- 
rived on this planet — although the 



123 




birds are not well known in the 
other cities either; they are all con- 
centrated in this area. Yes. our 
sportsmen tried to shoot down the 
whirlybirds. No luck, of course Im- 
agine the problems you have when 
one of these forty-foot balls of com- 
motion comes at you : You try to aim 
but you can’t hold your arm still 
because of the swirling wind they 
raise; and then the dust clouds thick- 
en and you’re firing wildly, and you 
can’t begin to tell which is body and 
which is feathers anyway.” 

“Very well,” accepted Charles De- 
Crabbe mercifully. “You’ve made at- 
tempt. My first step therefore the 
attachment of high explosives to 
boobytrapped mannequins. Brought 
these with me.” 

CC/^reat winds of catastrophe. I’m 

VJ glad you mentioned it before 
you did it!” exclaimed the mayor. 
“We tried that once. The city was 
six weeks digging out from under 
the feathers — and it didn’t kill the 
whirlvbird!” 

“Aren’t you exaggerating difficul- 
ties encountered in picking up few 
feathers?” loftily inquired DeCrabbe. 

“How do you think we got the 
name of Featherton? Before the 
deluge we were called West Apple- 
bury!” 

Then why haven’t you attempted 
lure them into boobytraps outside 
town? Could detonate them there 
withbut even slight inconvenience of 
picking up feathers.” 

“Believe me, if there were only a 
few feathers,” insisted Mayor Prince, 
“few enough for you to pick up by 

184 



yourself, we wouldn't mind you 
blowing up a whirlybird.” 

“Wasn’t considering picking up 
any feathers,” replied Five-gun with 
dignity. “Had supposed a menial or 
two could be supplied for that.” 
The mayor shook his head. “It 
would take everybody in town to 
clean up. And as for blowing one 
up outside the city, one of our or- 
chardists tried it. He blew it to bits 
all right, but eighty acres of his 
apple trees were smothered under the 
debris!” 

“Now anticipate that the exter- 
mination of the whirlybirds will al- 
most certainly take me up to two 
days,” conceded Five-gun DeCrabbe 
calmly. “However will be all the 
more interesting to defeat them with- 
out recourse large explosives.” 

“Gee, what a man!” admired the 
mayor’s son. “Only two days!” 

“If you will now lead me to your 
city park will begin campaign of ex- 
termination at once.” 

“It’s down that way,” said the 
mayor, pointing. Plainly he had no 
intention of leaving the shelter of 
the marquee. “You can’t miss it.” 
As Five- gun Charles DeCrabbe 
leaped back into his craft and started 
off, the mayor’s son called after him, 
“Aren’t vou scared, going out ex- 
posed like that?” 

DeCrabbe turned. “Am armed, 
young man,” he retorted severely. 

“Yeah, but those whirlybirds don’t 
pay any attention to guns.” 

“Soon will,” DeCrabbe replied, 
unruffled. 

Slowly he drove down the center 
of the empty street, receiving more 




cheers from heads thrust out of win- 
dows. He arrived at the city park 
and turned in. He unloaded most of 
his equipment under the roof of the 
bandstand. 

A few minutes later one of his 
robot mannequins moved slowly 
around the clearing before the band- 
stand, its control set for slow walk- 
ing to conserve its atomic battery. 
The predator hunter unlimbered all 
his guns as he sat under the band- 
stand roof waiting. 

It was an hour before the first 
whirlybird attacked. 

His first warning was the rising 
wind. His gaze moved around the 
sky until he found the rapidly grow- 
ing black spot. A few seconds later 
it became a universe-engulfing black- 
ness as it spotted the mannequin and 
came down for it. As soon as the 
wind-screaming blackness reached 
the mannequin, the needle guns in 
his hands emptied their hundreds of 
anesthetizing needles into the turbu- 
lence. But it was as the mayor had 
said. Where did the bird’s body end 
and the feathers begin? When the 
needle pistols were empty he drop- 
ped them and snatched up the rocket 
powered stun-gas weapon; its im- 
mense flare poured into the black- 
ness without' visible result. He drop- 
ped it and grabbed the N-ray flash- 
burn gun. The forty-foot ball of fury 
was beginning to rise high with its 
prey now, as the gun stuttered fifty 
bolts of burning lethal radiation into 
it. He smelled feathers that time. 
Finally as the giant bird, without fal- 
tering, rose above the range of the N- 
ray gun, he took to the explosive pel- 



let rifle It had only ten shots; all of 
these went into the center of the 
blackness well before the whirlybird 
had flown beyond ran*:e. And as it 
neared the horizon wnb its manne- 
quin prey, he heard its sweet song: 
“Coo! Coo!” 

“How dare it coo after all l did 
to it?” muttered DeCrabbe grimly. 
“Shall not coo next time!” 

H alf an hour later a new manne- 
quin stood out in front of the 
bandstand. Its arms waved cease- 
lessly but it stood still. Nestled against 
its back was a ten gallon drum of 
gas, which would be exploded — 
blanketing most of the park in fumes 
— as soon as the mannequin was 
moved. Charles DeCrabbe waited, 
his mask ready, his potent weapons 
all reloaded. 

Ninety minutes later the huge 
black menace arrived — either the 
first whirlybird or another forty-foot 
wind-screaming fury. Slipping his 
gas mask on, the man waited for the 
right moment to begin firing. The 
whirlybird swooped down, the tank 
exploded in a fog, and the giant 
wobbled! 

DeCrabbe emptied all his weapons 
again. The bird arose, wobbling, its 
speed greatly impaired, but making 
its getaway despite all he could do. 

“Damn well didn’t coo that time,” 
he said when the monster had reach- 
ed the horizon. “Next time won’t 
fly either.” 

But just then the monstrous bird 
mocked him in the distance with a 
loud, sweet. “Coo! Coo!” 

Shortly after lunch he had it all 

129 




set up. A new mannequin stood out 
in front of the bandstand, its arms 
waving and a pair of slim, gleaming, 
ten-gallon drums of stun gas nearby. 

It was one o’clock before the third 
whirlybird struck. 

Down it sank until it became a 
huge, ebony blot in the afternoon 
sky. Underneath the bandstand roof 
DeCrabbe got ready for his supreme 
effort. He slipped on his gas mask 
and made sure his N-ray flashburn 
gun was ready for instant action, its 
safety off. He was determined that 
if he got the bird prostrate he would 
climb aboard and fire N-ray bolts 
into it until something gave 1 

The huge black, wind-screaming 
monster plummeted the last few 
yards down and grabbed the manne- 
quin. Both tanks of stun gas ex- 
ploded. The giant whirlybird slumped 
unconscious — and DeCrabbe scram- 
bled aboard! 

The feverishly hurrying hunter was 
not long discovering why he had not 
— and never would — penetrate the 
bird’s feathers with any of his weap- 
ons: He burrowed down into the 
feathers the length of his arm and 
there were yet more feathers beyond! 
A feather pillow would stop a rifle 
bullet, he knew, and this monster 
had the probable equivalent of a 
thousand feather pillows protecting 
it, invulnerable as a battleship 
And just then the maneater awoke, 
wobbled into the air, and flew away 
before DeCrabbe could get off! 

T he following afternoon, as Five- 
gun Charles DeCrabbe made his 
farewell of the city of Featherton, 



he once more drove down the center 
of the street with the bubble of his 
space convertible slid back. 

Yet there was a difference this 
time. The mayor and his son rode 
beside him on the seat, and all of 
the people were now out of doors 
standing along the curb, cheering 
their deliverer wildly as he passed. 

“1 can’t tell you how much I 
personally appreciate what you’ve 
done for us,” said the mayor humbly. 

“Quite quite quite!” returned 
Five-gun haughtily in his clipped 
speech, hoping to shut off the man’s 
tendency toward windyness. 

With awe in his voice the mayor’s 
son admired, “So instead of being 
scared to leath you were all ready 
for action when you and the whirly- 
bird landed at their rocky, mountain 
lair?” 

“Yes yes yes! Slid off its back, 
hid between two boulders, waited 
for the appropriate moment. After 
bagging that one. waited for other 
monsters as they landed, one by one. 
Bagged them.” 

“Just like that!” said the young- 
ster. “You just get up close enough 
for those peoplehawks to grab you 
and then you bagged them.” 

“Only possible way is my way,* 
clipped DeCrabbe immovably. 

“Its eyes couldn’t be buried deeply 
in feathers if they were to be of use." 

“So?” 

“So eye is proximate to beak — 
and brain,” said the hunter with 
dignity. “Where one of its coo-coos 
came out, one of my N-ray bolts 
went in, and that was that!”

Dear Editor: 

Swell. One of the greatest letter 
departments that If ever had. Just 
started my curiosity again. The 
Snowbank Orbit by Fritz Leiber was 
the best story that you have pub- 
lished now since The Sounds of 
Earth by Arthur C. Clarke. I still 
want to shake your hand and con- 
gratulate a fine editor for a job 
well done. You are coming along 
with some of the top science-fic- 
tion writers in the whole field.

Dear Editor: 

Your cover art has improved re- 
markably with the September paint- 
ing. The July issue's disgusting ef- 
fort falls far, far behind Wenzel's 
latest contribution, which almost 
surpasses the 1961 (September) cov- 
er. May you continue to improve. 



Robert A. Heinlein in the Novem- 
ber issue? Maybe you are really 
looking up after all. Mr. McKey 
had a difficult “flipping” feat ahead 
of him.

• Nope. Stands for “Bug-Eyed 
Monsters” — old science-fiction ex- 
pression referring to the peculiar- 
looking aliens that used to appear 
on every science-fiction cover. Nat- 
urally we're above that sort of 
thing now. — Editor .

Dear Fred : 

The July If caught up with us 
here in Florida just while we're 
getting ready to shove off for 
Maine. 

To set the record straight, the 
writing of Masters of Space — ex- 
cept for some editorial revisions — 
was all mine. So was much of the 
plot; and I approved unreservedly 
both Evan's share of the plot and 
his rough draft upon which half of 
the final draft was based. 

I note without too much surprise 
that Mr. Winkes doesn't like it. He 
isn't quite alone in that. Mr. Best- 
er and Mr. Boucher and some others 
didn't like it, either. 

However, that fact doesn't bother 
me too much. Thelma Evans liked it, 
1 liked it, and a lot of fans liked 
it — and 1 learned long ago that no- 
body can please everybody.

Dear Editor: 

I just bought the September Is- 
sue of your magazine today and I 
thought I would drop you a few 
lines of first-impression comments 
and suggestions. 

What's the matter with your 
printing presses? As I flipped 

through this issue 1 saw a great 

number of printing blotches and on 

the second page of the story World 
in a Mirror I discovered a word so 
completely smeared that I could get 
no clue to what it was. How about 
dropping a ’hint to the printing boys 
not to put so much ink on the press- 
es? -

Dear Editor: 

Your July and September covers 
were beautiful! I think the Septem- 
ber cover's about the best cover 
I've ever seen on any science-fiction 
magazine. 

I'd like to see more of Wenzel.

Dear Editor: 

Reguards Retief and that Fustian 
jag: Come, gentlemen; you sir, Mr. 
Pohl, sir, for publishing such un- 
mitigated garp, and you, Mr. Lau- 
mer-san, for writing it. Especially 
you, Mr. Laumer. 

The plot was obviously prefabri- 
cated, the action was, leave us face 
it, implausible, the ending too pat, 
the villain not nearly villainous 
enough (why didn't you use a 
pussycat, Mr. Laumer, sir?), the 
dialogue clearly constructed from 
random combinations of alphabet 
cereal, the protagonist much too 
cocksure, arrogant and just all- 
around offensive, the supporting 
character name of Magnan too stu- 
pid — in short, Mr. Laumer, sir, 
your characters are celluloid stereo- 
types, your action is uncoordinated 
and amateurish and your imagin- 
ation is restricted by Grade F mys- 
tery magazine technique.

Dear Editor: 

The other day I was looking 
through the city library for some- 
thing I hadn't read, and ran across 
a book on how to build model planes 
by one J. K. Laumer. On the back it 
stated that J. Keith Laumer, at that 
time on duty with the U.S.A.F., had 
spent three years in the U. S. For- 
eign Service. The plot now begins 
to clear itself up a little. 

All professions have their private 
stock of stories on who did a fine 
job here and who was a horrible ex- 
ample there. Our State Department 
has sent some people abroad to rep- 
resent us who were no better pre- 
pared than Ambassador Magnan, 
some even worse, and others who 
were 100% on the beam. Read your 
world news and see what types kept 
•other people on our side, and what 
ones lost us much of that intangible 
stuff the Orientals call “face.” 

Laumer is merely mining his lit- 
tle stockpile of departmental folk- 
lore, setting them in far-off worlds. 
Long may he rave! Listen, reader, 
and perchance learn something of 
value to the present.

Dear Editor: 

I have just finished reading your 
September issue, and find it pass- 
able — no more ... It might be ques- 
tioned whether or not an editorial 
Is the place to conduct book reviews. 
I, for one, would rather see no edi- 
torial and a plainly labeled book re- 
view section. 

More serious is the fact that the 
reviews are not critical enough . 

I do not want to give the im- 
pression I did not enjoy the issue, 
for I did. But I am an sf addict, 



and enjoy anything that can pose 
as science fiction. In this letter I 
have tried to abandon this sort of 
attitude and take the attitude of 
an English prof critically review- 
ing serious literature — for I be- 
lieve science fiction can be and 
should be as meaningful as any 
other type of literature. It * ha3 
some advantages over other forms 
of literature, most noticeably in 
that it is the only form that does 
not carry an overwhelming burden 
of tradition; but it is not living 
up to its potentialities.

Dear Editor: 

I’m glad to hear about the IFir- 
story campaign. True, you'd prob- 
ably publish at least one new writ- 
er every issue anyway, but doing it 
formally should encourage a lot of 
amateurs who would like to write, 
but feel that they don't have a 
chance, competing against estab- 
lished pros . 

I'm afraid this letter ran rather 
long, but I say what I have to say. 
Do you feel that anything I said 
herein was unnecessary?
