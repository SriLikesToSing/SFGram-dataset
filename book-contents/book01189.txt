" Innocent 
” Eyes 



r OR MANY YEARS I touchcd Sci- 
ence fiction lightly — like a periodic 
comet visiting the solar system: I 
came around from time to time and 
glimmered briefly on the field’s 
periphery. 

This happened at airports, usual- 
ly, on the hind leg of a trip, with 
the day’s work done, the briefcase 
heavy, and my flight delayed 
somewhere by fog. Then I’d wander 
to the book racks looking for some- 
thing good to read: for hope springs 
eternal. 

At these times I had a strategy: to 
find that happy cross between the 
light and stimulating: nothing pre- 
tentious yet nothing vile, something 
for Technological Man: he plays in 
complex games and likes complex 
entertainment. When Eric Ambler 
couldn’t be found or Le Carree’s 
latest was not yet out in paperback, 
I reached for science fiction. 

Those were my days of purest in- 
nocence. 

I knew nothing about a science 
fiction world, its issues, or per- 
sonalities. When I bought a 
magazine, I skipped the “fact” and 
“letters” portions. I was after ac- 
tion, pure and simple. I assumed 
that all behaved like I did — authors, 
editors and readers: collaborating to 
produce or to enjoy that special 
brand of light entertainment: flights 
of projection into worlds that could 
well be. 

Sometimes a book had an effect 
beyond the ordinary. Then I might 
speculate for a moment, surprised 



that profundity lay hidden in such 
froth. Perhaps science fictipn writ- 
ers used a greater canvas, I thought, 
admitted fewer impediments, and 
therefore they were better “dream- 
ers.” I knew and valued Jungian 
psychology which stipulates a racial 
Unconscious with transcendental 
qualities, and sometimes I saw sci- 
ence fiction as a kind of racial 
dreaming. At its best it projected 
images of possibility, lubricated us 
by compensations, and slipped past 
our sober censorship to show us at 
our best or worst. In short, it was a 
Rorschach blot of galactic propor- 
tions, better than other forms of 
“escape.” 

As this notion took root, I some- 
times read a few current novels just 
to see what we were all dreaming: 
What do we fear? What are today’s 
specifications for paradise? 

If I had a hypothesis about the 
field, that was it. I guessed that sci- 
ence fiction’s social value — beyond 
the laudable aim of entertainment, 
pure and simple; its nutritional con- 
tent as opposed to its taste — lay in 
projecting alternatives to seek or 
shun. It was one of many channels 
by which psychic energies welled to 
the surface. 

I neither knew about nor made 
any fine distinctions — between hard 
science fiction and the softer kind, 
between space opera and new wave. 
I had the casual reader’s innocence, 
the supreme imperiousness of the 
consumer: if I liked it, it was good; 
if I didn’t, it was bad. 



FORUM

Good and bad, of course, meant 
specific things. Science fiction 
either had or lacked “reality” for 
me. The “real” is slippery and 
fades into the absurd when 
philosophers or physicists make it 
their target. I meant by that a com- 
mon sense of “believability” but 
with one exception: I expected 
technical wizzardry, spatial and 
temporal expansions and foreshort- 
enings, strangeness, and surprises. 
I didn’t fuss much about the sci- 
ence. A tale could violate Boyle’s 
law for all I cared. I was reading 
science fiction, not science. But 
even here I looked for plausibility. 
Seduction was fine but clumsy rape 
was rude. 

I held the notion that science fic- 
tion was about people, first of all. 
For science, hard or soft, one went 
to the real source, not the enter- 
tainment literature. The human ele- 
ment, for me, was constant, the en- 
vironment a variable. How would / 
behave in the topsy turvy setting? 
What would I do? What if I had a 
parasitic awareness in my head? 
What would we do when they land- 
ed? 

This given, I had no tolerance for 
slippery psychology or ignorance of 
social behaviour. Nothing galled me 
more, after paying out a dollar, than 
cardboard figurines enacting some 
weighty speculation about matter. 
Vaguely articulated alien social sys- 
tems, designed purely to deliver 
convenient plot incidents, could 
make me frown. Depictions of 

6 



Congress by folk who’d never been 
on Capitol Hill, of military be- 
haviour by persons who had obvi- 
ously never studied military ways, 
of scientists who weren’t in the 
slightest like the ones I’d worked 
with, superior beings that weren’t 
superior, primitives who weren’t 
primitive — all these and many more 
such phenomena left me feeling 
cheated: for the illusion of reality 
was shattered and the rest was cold 
porridge. After a string of so-so 
books or stories, I told myself that 
I’d outgrown the field. Either I 
knew too much to be seduced, or 
else the writers had grown clumsy. 

Then, ever and agaip. I’d run 
into excellence: books like Herbert’s 
Dune or Brunner’s Stand on Zan- 
zibar. These occasional gems recal- 
led earlier great experiences — like 
reading Heinlein’s The Puppet Mas- 
ters, to name a special favorite of 
mine. The real authors were obvi- 
ously around, producing grand illu- 
sions worth the money, worth even 
all those other books I had left half 
read in the seat pockets of countless 
airplanes. 

But nevertheless — and science 
fiction was a good trip for me as a 
reader — as time passed I grew more 
and more jaded, more and more ir- 
ritable, and ever harder to satisfy. I 
was almost ready, put another way, 
to become a writer. 

it -k -k 

And thus the orbit of that occa- 

GALAXY 




sional comet decayed toward the 
center. I came to see the mystery 
from closer up. 

(Why and how a man becomes a 
writer is best left unexplored. Be- 
sides, there’s nothing to it. Writing, 
as all authors will tell you, is sim- 
ple and fun. The ideas come, you 
dash them off, and pop the pages in 
the mail. Three days later a breath- 
less editor calls to say Yes! Soon 
you are rich and famous. That, in a 
nutshell, is the common experi- 
ence.) 

Before I had learned that lesson 
and still believed in needless strug- 
gle, I set to work with system to 
master the new environment. I be- 
gan to read the magazines from 
cover to cover and learned that in- 
siders called them “zines” — much 
as conferences were simply 
“cons.” There were “issues” in 
the field (i.e. Is SF literature?). I 
learned to distinguish between read- 
ers, fans, aspirants (who wrote let- 
ters), Big Name Fans, writers, 
names. Names, Big Names, and 
Masters, these being the designa- 
tions of ranks in the science fiction 
hierarchy back then. (Robert Hein- 
lein had not yet received the Grand 
Master Nebula award; he was still 
slumming with the Asimov’s and 
Clarke’s and Pohl’s.) 

As yet, however, I hadn’t met 
science fiction face to face — only 
through print, darkly. 

Then one day an occasion pre- 
sented itself. Our local county lib- 
rary announced a “workshop” on 

FORUM 



science fiction. A well-known editor 
and several authors would be pres- 
ent. A local college planned to 
tape the session for later classoroom 
use. 

I combed my beard and went to 
take the plunge. 

The reference desk had yielded to 
a table with a water pitcher and a 
stack of styrofoam cups. (Later the 
authors would break those cups 
apart, bit by bit, or doodle on their 
sides while awaiting a turn to 
speak.) The camera crews were get- 
ting ready. The audience sat wait- 
ing. 

But what an audience! They were 
so young. They were young but 
also earnest, intense, and uptight 
with expectations. For a second I 
saw myself hidden in the stacks 
watching the proceedings with half 
an eye, an open book in hand. Then 
I noticed one or two adults: a tan- 
ned suburban mother in sandals, a 
man with a red beard, a crewcut, 
greying fellow in a blue suit and 
tie. I sat down myself, a little ill at 
ease. What I had gleaned from let- 
ter columns seemed true; a motly 
following had science fiction. 

Suddenly they came: the editor 
leading the authors. They wore 
sticky-backed name tags, their 
names in felt tip pen. I only re- 
member Roger ^lazny because he 
wore a suit, seemed slightly bored, 
spoke sparingly, and gave a 
memorably worded, concise, and 
graphic description of the Nebula 
award — which he had earned and 

7 




had been asked to explain. He gave 
a physical description while the 
question had probed the institution 
behind the thing. I sensed an irony 
arid the fast play of invisible 
swords. 

The editor opened his briefcase 
and laid on the table, fanned out 
like cards, several copies of the cur- 
rent issue of his magazine. He had 
surprised me by looking a touch 
countrified in cowboy boots. He 
was the chairman and host. The TV 
director signalled, the audience 
drew breath, and the show was on. 

Then came a drill which, I later 
learned, is a sine qua non of sci- 
ence fiction gatherings: when the 
chair goes around the table to hear 
e^ch man define what science fic- 
tion means to him — but so far as I 
am aware no one ever says: Well, 
last year it paid for new siding on 
the house and this year — if they re- 
print my Kama Sutra Luna and it 
does better than the last time — we’ll 
give the old Dodge the heave-ho. 

In fairy tales, just before the hero 
penetrates the secret cave to find the 
treasure or the princess, obstacles, 
alarms, and monsters rise before 
him on the narrow path. 

Those on the inside of institutions 
have a way of frightening would-be 
joiners. I think they do it from an 
unconscious, biological, territorial 
urge. 

Thus, science fiction having been 
defined, the panel turned to the fu- 
ture of the field, and now came a 
flood of negatives designed to dis- 

8 



courage closer approach. I learned 
that things were in bad shape. Sci- 
ence fiction stumbled backwards in 
bleeding retreat, pressed by adverse 
economics, disintegrating distribu- 
tion systems, a growing illiteracy, 
the encroachements of pseudo- 
science fiction writers like Von- 
negut, the competition of TV, and 
academic smarty-pants wishing to 
crucify the genre on a cross of 
analysis. 

So much for that “author’s 
perch’’ on Spain’s Costa Brava 
from whence one member of the 
audience had planned, later in the 
year, to start that steady march to 
noble Stockholm. 

Close observation, engendered by 
the presentations, revealed that the 
authors did not look especially well 
fed. They were like people — which 
gave me hope but little comfort — 
tall, thin, overweight, young old. 
And Zelazny, of course, wrapped in 
relative silence. 

At last the panel opened for ques- 
tions. The questions were new to 
me but hindsight tells me they were 
standard, a part of the science fic- 
tion ritual like the dialogue between 
priest and congregation {Dominus 
vobiscum. — Et cum Spiritu tuo.) 

— Did the editor like to see sword 
and sorcery? This came from a 
youngster, tall, dark, slender, pim- 
ply, with horrendous inkspots on his 
right index and middle fingers. By 
the time the editor had dealt with 
that, another aspirant had switched 
to origami. 



GALAXY 




— Why did the science fiction 
field avoid the subject of sex? The 
questioner was in his twenties. He 
wore a beard and “sat” slouched 
on his chair. You might say that his 
back was sitting; his rears hung 
free. 

The editor began, defensively, 
and several authors signalled that 
they, too, wanted a crack at that. 

We learned that authors “put in” 
or “used” sex whenever it was ap- 
propriate. The days of sexless sci- 
ence fiction were gone for good — 
together with bug-eyed monsters. 

I had a vision of an author before 
a shelf of little bottles. One bottle is 
labelled “sex.” He takes it down, 
uncaps and sniffs it, grins lewdly, 
and ca-a-a-a-a-refiilly lets one drop! 
fall into the boiling pot. 

(For some readers, I’ve learned to 
my benefit, it’s quite sufficient to 
wave the open bottle in the rising 
steam. That way you get to keep 
and use the sex at home.) 

Next question? 

— Who, in the panel’s opinion, a 
questioner behind me wanted to 
know, was the greatest science fic- 
tion writer of all time and — and, 
more specifically, would the panel 
say whether they thought that Hein- 
lein’s Time Enough for Love mea- 
sured up to the rest of Heinlein’s 
work. 

Now came a bandying of names. 
None of the panelists claimed the 
honor, and those named were not 
around to defend themselves. It was 
agreed, however, that Time Enough 

FORUM 



for Love should not be held against 
“Bob.” What about Ursula LeGuin, 
a young woman in glasses asked ap- 
ropos of nothing. The panel went 
off on a side trip about the feminist 
issue — in response more to the 
young woman’s tone than her ques- 
tion. 

At last it broke into a reception 
with punch and cookies. But I 
didn’t stay. 

★ ★ ★ 

Some time after that my name 
appeared in print and my interest in 
scienee fiction (the “insider’s 
world) grew. I joined the Science 
Fietion Writers of America (SFWA) 
and in moments of procrastination 
studied the group’s little yellow 
newsletter. Much was made of an 
astonishing controversy between 
Joanna Russ and Arthur Clarke on 
the subject of unconscious male 
chauvinism, which I found amus- 
ing. As for the rest. .? 

I was no longer the rank outsider 
now, nor yet completely in, the 
well known “dangerous” stage, a 
silly season. And so, weakened and 
stimulated simultaneously, I visited 
one of the Cons. 

My initial forays into the field, 
bolstered by closer reading of fan 
letters, had started me thinking that 
science ficition, in one of its dimen- 
sions at least, was a kind of cult. I 
meant to check that hypothesis by 
visiting a conference. 

My reasoning along these lines 

9 




had had its origin in an article on 
“consumption communities” I’d 
read years ago. Daniel Boorstin, 
writing in Fortune in 1967, spoke 
of the fellowship of Doublemint 
chewers, J&B Scotch drinkers, 
Chevrolet sports car drivers, and the 
like: loose communities based on a 
togetherness in consumption. 

I had thought about that concept 
from time to time and had found it 
to be true. As the great “monocul- 
tures” were evidently losing their 
power (Christianity, Islam), they 
seemed to be replaced by other con- 
cepts of value and organization 
based on economic or emotional 
dominants. I couldn’t help thinking 
that we were reverting back to to- 
tem cults for lack of a higher vi- 
sion. Could science fiction be one of 
those totems? Was it a specialized 
youth cult — an heretical way to 
socialize tumed-off kids, to assim- 
ilate them to the post-Technological 
age? 

Seeing is believing. Once more I 
waded into the surf. 

Let me use an author’s right to 
obscure the particulars of space and 
time. Nor will what I shall write be 
true in the strictest sense. I’m after 
an impression, not a report. 

The event was called the Con- 
con — at least initially. Held in a 
very big city (no, not that big), in a 
grand old hotel, it offered the usual 
smorgasboard: speeches, dinners, a 
guest of honor, a huckster room, 
exhibits, receptions, readers, fans, 
aspirants, writers, names. Names, 

10 



Big Names, and even a Master or 
two. Also: editors, agents, a delega- 
tion from the Planet of the Apes, 
publishers, actors, astronauts, and 
little old ladies in tennis shoes. The 
registration fee made you gulp if — 
under-estimating the power of sci- 
ence fiction — you came with a 
single ten-dollar bill in your 
billfold. And the scene blew your 
mind if — until that time — you 
hadn’t seen a cult in its swarming. 

Imagine now the grand ballroom 
filled with people. Try not to look 
too obviously at the young women 
dressed in the merest of scarves, 
scarves that seemed to hold moist 
balls of trembling dough. Concen- 
trate instead on beaded blue denim 
jackets depicting Saturn and other 
planets, the “I Love Hugo 
Gernsback” belt buckles, the Bat- 
man T-shirts, and apes smoking 
cigarettes. Better yet, sit down, al- 
ready, and keep the eyes on the 
platform up front, the (tok walls of 
gold-laced mirrors, the half-dimmed 
chandeliers. 

The microphone was ticklish and 
bitchy and screamed horrendously 
under the jerky hand of someone 
hard to see. At last we were under 
way. Introductions. Then came an 
adi'ess. The words echoed about 
and were difficult to understand. 
Next to me a young man in heavy 
socks and tremendous hiking boots 
took crackers from his backpack 
and began his breakfast. 

It was mid-morning when the key 
(unscheduled) event took place. By 

GALAXY 




now a panel had taken over. They 
discussed the work of some sage 
who claimed that earth and Venus 
had once collided to help Moses 
part the red sea. Emotions ran high. 
Evidently one was either for or 
against the sage. Even those who 
claimed to have an open mind were 
either pro or con — something they 
did not realize but an innocent like 
me could readily discern. 

Then there was a hullaballoo in 
the back. Heads turned. The flow of 
talk at the head table slowed. Sud- 
denly a little man marched in. He 
swept the crowd with a single, im- 
perious glance and cut a pose: arms 
outstretched to the side, his legs 
apart. / am here, he seemed to say; 
look, it is I! 

He had a face that might have 
been cherubic once but now was 
lean. A beret sat tilted on his head. 
He wore a parka on top and tight- 
fitting, bell-bottomed, purple slacks 
below. I couldn’t see his shoes. 

Many individuals rose and made 
their way toward the man. In the 
rush of sound I could not make out 
what anyone said, but I caught the 
phrase that he — whoever he might 
have been — must have come in on 
the Red Eye. 

For a moment the little man was 
overwhelmed by the admiring wave. 
Then 1 saw him again, struggling to 
free himself — shaking hands, pat- 
ting backs, embracing girls — but 
ever striving toward the platform. 

Soon he was there. The panel 
shrunk back as he mounted the

steps. In the electric atmosphere this 
entrance had engendered, the sage 
was forgotten for a moment — not 
Venus but Jupiter himself seemed to 
have collided with the science fic- 
tion world. He took the microphone 
from the podium attachment — the 
podium itself would have hidden 
him from view — and stepping to the 
side he said that. 

. .Elfin wings had brought him 
tither just in time to rescue this 
schlampig conference from the dol- 
drums. Con-con was not a proper 
name for such a convention. It 
dated the field and brought to mind 
legs kicking in rythmic union. No, 
indeed. A new name would have to 
be found, now he was here. 

What name? someone called from 
the floor. 

The Harley-con! the little man 
announced. 

And amidst laughter, cheers, and 
wild, exuberant applause, all those 
present seemed to approve the name 
by acclamation. 

* * * 

Thus I beheld one of the cult 

n 





gods, a Big Name at the least. To 
anyone imbued with even a smidgin 
of ambition, it was a dangerous vi- 
sion indeed! It hinted at rewards un- 
guessed at before; fame, public 
acclaim, the intoxicating embrace of 
sound from the floor below, the 
psychic ocean, whose waves one 
imperious gesture could still, whose 
energies could be roused to storm 
proportions by a single call. 

The session ended eventually and 
we expanded, like hot gas, to take 
in the rest of Harley-con. 

Those masses of people, the con- 
stant churning motion in the halls; 
the booths; the detritus of displays 
collecting in comers; the tired fans 
resting on the floor, backs against 
walls; the tight, fannish clumps 
seeking autographs around invisible ■ 
Masters: all this exhilarated and 
frightened that part of me which re- 
sponds to dreams. 

I wandered about. 

Here, in a room, a writer with a 
striking name — Tarantula Crusoe, I 
think it was — sang funny songs to 
the accompaniment of his guitar. I 
sat for a while watching Captain 
Kirk on a screen. 

Then came an editors panel, and 
I sat down to listen. The table cloth 
was red. One editor was smug, the 
others bled. I recognized my friend 
from the county library. He dodged 
rotten eggs having to do with a 25- 
cent reading charge. The second 
editor tried his best to stop a vicious 
sally from the floor led by a 
phalanx of unpaid writers. At best it 

12 



was a draw; the writers drew blood. 
A third one complained about the 
price of paper. The fourth one 
looked surprised and wondered out 
loud what the fuss was all about. 

I wondered, in turn, which of the 
four enjoyed the highest circulation, 
and I would’ve bet it was the 
fourth. 

Somehow it all came out all 
right, at the end — else by then I had 
become accustomed to the wall of 
negations.’ Experience said that pub- 
lishers paid fast or slow, depending; 
not much, but they paid. Paper was 
dear, but they kept printing on it. 
And to an aspirant, hungry for 
fame, what’s a quarter, anyway? 

On the way out I saw a Master; a 
leonine head, flowing grey hair. For 
the moment he was almost alone. 
He stood chatting amiably with two 
stupendous ladies. 

I hesitated, well within his aura. 
Should I intrude and shake his 
hand? What will I say? “Sir, back 
in the ’50’s I enjoyed your robot 
stories. Terriffic stuff’? What had I 
read that was more recent? All that 
came to me was a detective short- 
story whose plot had turned on a 
lost button. 

He who hesitates is lost. The au- 
tograph hunters had caught up. I 
said good-bye to Harley-con, re- 
flecting that I would never make 
much of a fan. 

On my windshield a ten-dollar 
parking ticket flapped in the humid 
breeze. So much for the magnetism 
of science fiction authors.

On the way home I mused about 
that mass of youth I’d seen, the cult 
god on the platform, the conversa- 
tions I had overheard. People over 
thirty had been conspicuous by ab- 
sence. Yet such folk were reading 
the stuff. Had they been teenage 
disciples too, once upon a time? 
Were they living the science fiction 
they’d read about in puberty? 
Would these youngsters end up liv- 
ing the stuff we wrote? — not literal- 
ly, of course, but subtly changed 
and adapted to reality? 

If it is a cult, I told myself, it 
might have its value: a chrysalis 
from which will crawl, well- 
conditioned to withstand tomorrow’s 
future shock, a new generation of 
the post-technocracy — or whatever. 

By the time I reached home, the 
speculative fever had died down 
somewhat. Hypothesis, I told my- 
self: just another hypothesis, 
another attempt to horn an irrational 
phenomenon into the utilitarian 
shoe. 

The fans were there because they 
pleased; the writers wrote because 
they pleased; it was nothing more 
profound. 

Some time after that I tried to 
transmute my experience into an 
ironic story about a fan. The 
Harley-con would be in it, of 
course, and plenty of weird far-out 
types — and a score of middle-aged 
writers trying to foist off their 
worn-out military and sexual fan-

tasies on the young in a coating of 
science. 

That, too, is an aspect of the 
field, of course, but I get skittish 
about boxes, and so that little enter- 
prise died a quiet death. Requiescat 
in pacem. 

* * ★ 

My next and last encounter with 
the science fiction world — aside 
from writing and all that goes with 
it — was a Nebula dinner in a very 
big city (yes, that city). 

I went in part from necessity. 
With a name like mine, even in sci- 
ence fiction circles it is difficult to 
gain credibility. I wanted to prove 
that I was the real thing, no mere 
pseudonym. 

This affair caught me by surprise. 
After Harley-con, I had expected 
this gathering to be a psychedelic 
happening squared. But I should 
have known better. Only writers 
come to Nebula affairs, and the 
priests are not the congregation: 
they wear black robes, stiff collars, 
and inhabit the quiet inner court- 
yards of meditation. 

Everything was simple, mea- 
sured, and dignified. I felt at ease 
in my blend-in organization-man 
clothes. I was among professionals 
and recognized the atmosphere. 

Close up and relaxed — the unruly 
constituencies held at bay by invisi- 
ble bars — the people at the center of 
science fiction gave me a good im- 
pression. I found the writers open, 

13 




friendly, and self-contained. 

I had expected more animosity, 
frankly. 

In the letter columns of SFWA’s 
circular, I had encountered the most 
juvenile sort of rubbish imaginable; 
thoughtless effusions, petty carping, 
clumsy clowning, lockerroom 
humor, and plain stupidity: distaste- 
ful to an innocent who looks at 
writing (even “funny” writing) as a 
serious matter. 

Little of that sewage-stream sur- 
faced on Nebula Day — though there 
were a few false notes, of course. I 
sensed the jostle of egos now and 
then, especially during dinner after 
a few drinks. The SFWA meeting 
was a typical union affair. Pub- 
lishers were not especially popular. 
There were camps within the tribe, 
vaguely defined (for me) but real 
enough. The dominant tone over- 
came the noise, however, all in all. 

The highlight of the evening was 
the first award of the Grand Master 
Nebula, larger in size than the regu- 
lar award. It went to Robert Hein- 
lein, a trim, bullet-headed venerable 
of the field. He was genuinely 
touched as we all rose to give him a 
standing ovation. Something ended 
that evening: the completion of an 
edifice — pyramid-shaped, of course. 
The final stone had been placed on 
top and the hierarchy was complete. 

I looked about at the tightly- 
packed tables surprised a little at 
finding myself there, in the inner 
circle — albeit at its outer edge: men 
and women of all ages. The glisten- 
14 



ing Nebulas were carried off, one 
by one. Laughter rolled and shop- 
talk buzzed. Despite the formal 
dress some wore, the beatnik 
threads of others, I saw ordinary 
craftsmen all about and understood 
it all a little better: here was science 
fiction as a profession or a trade 
(take your pick), and this affair was 
an association meeting. The creators 
of imaginary empires were like — 
well, no more flamboyant, say, than 
a West Coast contingent of electri- 
cal engineers. 

A big, crowded reception fol- 
lowed dinner. It went on and on, 
well past my bedtime. The next 
morning, a bright and empty Sun- 
day, I caught a plane home. 

* * * 

Some time has passed now, but 
on the subject of science fiction I 
remain an innocent still — despite 
these near-encounters with the mys- 
tery. And I’m fairly sure I’d prefer 
to stay that way. Much can be made 
of nothing much on the one hand; 
and on the other profundities turn 
banal on close examination. Science 
fiction is both of these and neither. 

It’s best for me, as writer and as 
reader (though I don’t urge this on 
anyone else), to take it like it 
comes. Definitions will never hold 
water in the arts, though there are 
countless busy potters patching the 
container. Nothing dies so quickly 
as on a vivisection table, and I pre- 
fer to run about free in the valleys 
and on the hills. ★ 



GALAXY 




About to die. And so on. 

We’re al] going to die. 

The Sahara is your back yard, 
so’s the Pacific Trench: die there 
and you won’t be lonely. On Earth 
you are never more than 13,000 
miles from anywhere, which as the 
man said is a tough commute, but 
the rays of light from the scene of 
your death take little more than a 
tenth of a second to go. .any- 
where! 

We’re nowhere. 

We’ll die alone. 

This is space travel: Imagine a 
flat world, a piece of paper, say, 
with two spots on it but very far 
apart. If you were a two- 
dimensional triangle, how would 
you get from one spot to the other? 
Walk? Too far. But fold the paper 
through the third dimension (ours) 
so that the spots match exactly — if 
you were a triangle you couldn’t see 
or feel this, of course — and you are 
at the proper place. We do this in 
the fourth. Don’t ask me how. Only 
you must be very, very careful, 
when you fold spacetime, not to 
sloosh the paper around or let it 
slide: then you end up not on the 
spot you wanted but God knows 
where, maybe entirely out of our 
Galaxy, which is that dust you see 
in the sky on clear nights when 
you’re away from cities. The glitter- 
ing breath of angels. Far, far from 
home. The light of our dying may 
not reach you for a thousand million 
years. That ordinary sun up there, a 
little hazy now at noon, that smeary 
spot. 

We do not know where we are. 

At dawn there was an intensely 
brilliant flash far, far under the 
horizon, and about an hour later the 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



noise of the thing; I figured the way 
you do for thunderstorms, the lag 
between light and sound: one- 
hippopotamus, two-hippopotamus, 
three-hippopotamus, four-hippo- 
potamus, five-hippopotamus — 
there’s your mile. Seven hun- 
dred miles. That’s over a thousand 
kilometers . In the event of mechanical 
dysfunction, the ship’s computer goes 
for the nearest “tagged” planet, i.e. 
where human life is supposed to be 
possible, then ejects the passenger 
compartment separately. Lays an egg, 
you might say. We won’t be visited 
without a distress call , however, now 
the colonization fever’s died down 
(didn’t take long, divide five billion 
people by twenty and the remainders 
start getting clubby again). 

Goodbye ship, goodbye crew, 
goodbye medicine, goodbye books, 
goodbye freight, goodbye baggage, 
goodbye computer that could have 
sent back an instantaneous distress 
call along the coordinates we came 
through (provided it had them, 
which I doubt), goodbye plodding 
laser signal no faster than other 
light that might have reached 
somewhere, sometime, this time, 
next time, never. You’ll get around 
to us, say in a couple of thousand 
years. 

We’re a handful of persons in a 
metal bungalow: five women, three 
men, bedding, chemical toilet, sim- 
ple tools, an even simpler pocket 
laboratory, freeze-dried food for six 
months, and a water-distiller with 
its own sealed powerpack, good for 
six months (and cast as a unit, un- 
usable for anything else). 

Goodbye, everybody. 

At dawn I held hands with the 
other passengers, we all huddled to- 



17 




gether under that brilliant flash, al- 
though I hate them. 

O god, I miss my music.

(This is being recorded on a poc- 
ket vocoder I always carry; the 
punctuation is a series of sounds not 
often used for words in any lan- 
guage: triple gutturals, spits, 
squeaks, pops, that kind of thing. 
Sounds like an insane chicken. 
Hence this parenthesis.) 

Of the women: myself. A Mrs. 
Valeria Graham, actually married to 
Mr. Graham, in the delicate fifties 
when alimony becomes mandatory 
upon divorce (who would pay 
whom is a conjecture here). Valeria 
Victrix habitually wears the classi- 
cal Indian sari, usually gold em- 
broidered on royal blue, like a tele- 
vision hostess’s; this does not suit a 
petite chemical blonde. Ditto the 
many-splendored earrings: bells 
within cages within hoops. 

A dark young woman who does 
yoga on her head, off to some “un- 
important job’’ somewhere (she 
said), hates everyone, says she’s 
called Nathalie. Nathalie what? 
Nathalie nothing. Mind your own 
business. 

Cassie, thirty-ish, beginning to 
put on weight; you’ll find her wait- 
ing table in any restaurant or nude 
bar on any world. She looks like an 
earlier stage in the life-cycle of 
Mrs. Graham, but that’s an illusion; 
nothing but a convulsion of nature 
could let either or these two rise or 
fall to the other’s level. (Hydrogen 
fusion, which provided unlimited 
power and should’ve made us all 
rich, but of course didn’t.)

A Graham child, female, four- 
teen, a beautiful cafe-au-lait so she 
is either Mrs. Graham’s by a former 
marriage or Mr. Graham’s ditto, or 
neither. Hors de combat all trip 
with one of the few bacterial dis- 
eases left, or rather the treatment 
for it, which had made her dread- 
fully ill. We’d see her only when 
she’d stagger into the lounge, look- 
ing beauti^l and hopeless, and then 
vomit (again). For whoever finds 
this and has no Greek, an iatrogenic 
disease is one created by the physi- 
cian and vye have plenty of them. 
The physicians and the diseases. 

This will never be found. 

Who am I writing for, then? 

The men: Mr. Graham, a big 
powerful male in his early fifties, 
hollow and handsome in the same 
style as his wife: coloring, dress, 
and person. Three days out (we 
were on the way to find the first 
spot we can then fold onto the sec- 
ond spot) Cassie took off the mask, 
stopped being squeezably-soft, and 
lost all expression. The Grahams 
stopped speaking to her. I say 
“male’’ because he emphasizes it 
subtly, so perhaps she’s the buyer 
and he’s the bought. Or both: 
money marries money. Relations 
with men are still apt to be pat- 
terned on a few rather dull models, 
especially among strangers, so I 
know less about the men than I do 
about the women, but in one way I 
know more: I mean the conception 
of themselves they find it publicly 
necessary to live up to. 

Alan: a young man with a set of 
shoulders like unto those of one 
who plays le futbol (says he did). 
Extremely polite and attentive, with 
a carefully intent way of listening to 

GALAXY 




everybody and agreeing civilly and 
much too often (“Oh, I do agree 
with you, Mr. Graham, I really 
do”). 

My theory is that this obvi- 
ously insincere behavior conceals 
absolutely nothing; he’s rich enough 
to take the poor man’s Grand Tour, 
poor enough to need a job, decent 
enough not to hurt anyone unless 
he’s frightened or hurt himself 
(which could happen pretty easily), 
and anxious enough to flatter 
whomever he thinks can help him. 
The Grahams, you see, are slum- 
ming. 

An historian of ideas traveling 
from one University to another and 
extremely evasive about his work, 
as they all are, now there’s so little 
of it to go around; he wears Mr. 
Graham’s kind of conservative 
clothes: shorts and sport-shirts, 
bright but not daylight-fluorescent 
(Vic Graham in blue, John Ude in 
red). The only historical analogy to 
Alan’s costumes is Graustark, all 
gold braid, epaulettes, and boots 
(except the shako, which I think he 
had to leave behind on account of 
the weight, though he never men- 
tioned it). The professor is John 
Ude. Thirties. A very minor intel- 
lectual. Bland. Often displays The 
Smile. The first day, in the lounge, 
when Mrs. Graham actually intro- 
duced herself as Mrs. Graham- 
which is rather like presenting your- 
self as a Dame of the British Em- 
pire or a Roman Tribune — Professor 
Ude displayed (after a blank mo- 
ment) The Smile. Then he took out 
from his sporran The Pipe, gestur- 
ing at The Pipe with The Smile to 
show that he was aware of his own 
self-mockery. He would have re- 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



ceived Valeria as Mistress Anne 
Bradstreet, had she so required, be- 
cause the Grahams are rich. Black- 
body-suited, perpetually angry 
Nathalie said audibly, "Missiz^. Oh 
God,” and turned away with an un- 
believing, outraged, I knew-it-was- 
going-to-be-one-of-those-trips look. 

Alan gaped hysterically, then 
shut his mouth. I said nothing. 
Think of it: Valeria and Victor in 
blue, Ude in red, Alan indescriba- 
ble, Cassie in two stars and a 
cache-sexe (both silver), and Lori 
Graham in body paint, mostly blue 
(to match her parents’ clothes). The 
arrows of Professor Ude’s irony 
point only down in the social scale, 
never up; when they occasionally 
point at himself, he is very careful 
to blunt them. 

Oh, we are a dull bunch! The 
professor once uncrimped enough to 
get into a long discussion with Vic- 
tor Graham about the new lease of 
life given capitalism by the unli- 
mited power of hydrogen fusion, 
the poor fool. He believes in free 
enterprise, competition, achieve- 
ment-orientation, the meritocracy. 
He’s never been behind the crew 
panels where the technocrats live. 
Travel enough and you can make 
friends with the crew, what’s this, 
what’s that, ask questions; they even 
let you fiddle about in sick bay if 
you’re careful. You see things, then, 
if you’re careful. 

Meritocracy? We’re being kept 
off the streets, that’s all, rich or 
poor. (Foundations pay me to lec- 
ture on music and play tapes of it; 
that’s why I travel. I’m a scrounge.) 

I once said to Ude, “How fast do 
you think things really change?” 

He said, “"niat’s not my field.”

Cassie, determined, bitter, 
exhausted, full-breasted, wanted to 
know what a musicologist was and 
what kind of music. 

“Very old,” I said. “European 
twelfth century to Baroque. No 
farther. ’ ’ 

“How nice,” Mrs. Graham said. 
“We must tell Lori.” 

“Who cares,” Cassie said. 

1 wear body-suits and sandals, 
like Nathalie, and keep a low pro- 
file, especially with passengers. 
This isn’t a luxury liner; you don’t 
have to eat with anybody, just dial 
a meal out of the locker. 

And visit the crew. And envy 
them. 

Behold the new irrelevants: para- 
sites, scum, proles, scroungers. 
People who do nothing real. 

No, dinosaurs. 

Isn’t. .wasn’t, I mean, a luxury 
liner. 

Stranded dinosaurs.

Day first. I’m sitting in the 
corner of the empty tool chest after 
a little nap. Already excited talk of 
“colonization,” whatever, that is. 
Our tiny laboratory tells us the air is 
safe, although perhaps a little thin; 
there’s nothing directly poisonous 
outside. Nathalie’s unexpected talent 
for cataloguing and arranging tools 
(which is why the tool box is emp- 
ty). The sun up for at least fifteen 
hours, taking a slow tour of the 
horizon at what my childhood tells 
me is 4 P.M. late autumn, so we 
have either a very great axial tilt or 
are in very high latitudes. A few 
weeks’ observation and perhaps we 
can guess if we’re approaching the 

20 



summer solstice or going the other 
way, which could give us some idea 
of how long the seasons will be: 
could be ten years of summer (and 
it’s hot outside now, about 30° C, 
they tell me). Through the window 
you can see ordinary green trees, 
hilly up-and-downish but not much, 
some little natural clearings. Very 
much like New Jersey a hundred 
and thirty-five years ago, when my 
ancestors came to Ellis Island; about 
nineteen-aught-five that was. My 
natemal something-great-grandfather 
was a plumber, my maternal 
something-great-grandmother a 
sheitel-maker. (A sheitel is a wig 
which Orthodox Jewish women 
used to wear after marriage, over 
their shorn hair. But what do you 
care.) We don’t remember the ac- 
tual genealogy of the other side 
nearly so far back, but I’ve inher- 
ited their looks: little, dark, Sephar- 
dic Jews fleeing the Spanish frontier 
at night with rubies, emeralds, and 
uncut diamonds sewn into the hems 
of their cloaks. At least I like to 
think of them that way. I carry the 
modern equivalent, the only cur- 
rency that passes everywhere, sewn 
into my jacket, my neckband, my 
belt, so flat you couldn’t detect it. I 
mean a whole pharmacopoeia. Be- 
cause you never know what you 
will need. (I flicked a little from the 
ship, too: nothing important.) 

Our equipment isn’t good enough 
to test whether the life here is edi- 
ble. We’re not supposed to do that. 
Commonly the problem has been 
people contaminating the planet, but 
there have been instances of vice- 
versa. We’re supposed to stay inside. 

Everybody is getting on every- 
body else’s nerves. 



GALAXY 




Victor, in his hearty, overem- 
phasized, hollow voice: “I believe I 
should.” (Tail end of a conversa- 
tion about who’s to go out first. 
Not that it matters. We either go 
out eventually or cut our throats.) 

“Why?” says Nathalie instantly. 

“Because I’m old. Expendable. 
Why else?” (Lori Graham is look- 
ing adoring and anxious.) 

“Very sensible,” says Nathalie. 
“So should Mrs. Graham.” (Lori 
outraged.) 

“Well, if there’s any harm. .” 
This is John Ude. 

“The Grahams will go,” says 
Nathalie, over her shoulder, and 
continues putting together our 
shovels, our hammers, our axes — 
“half an hour, no less, no 
more” — and something longer that 
comes in sections. 

The Grahams go out the air-lock, 
Victor stooping, Alan kindly re- 
straining Lori when she tries to 
slip out with them. They have an in- 
tense, whispered conversation with 
Lori close to tears. 

“My, you are just an ordinary 
traveler, aren’t you!” I say to 
Nathalie, hoping to get a rise from 
her, maybe learn something. No 
answer. She’s engaged in jointing 
together what we both realize at the 
same instant is a single-passenger 
hovercraft: sealed motor, no cab, 
kicks up so much dust that you 
have to wear an air-filter (included 
in the box; by Saint George, I was 
right), flies over any terrain with 
ease, including water (at under 32 
kph, however), and looks like no- 
thing so much as a stick with a sad- 
dle; hence its name. 

“A br — ” (she catches herself). 

“Broomstick,” I finish. On her 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



knees, in the midst of spare parts, 
in her black skin-tights, Nathalie 
gives me (for a moment only) a 
glance of shock, of wild surmise — 
are you one, too? 

“Where were you really going?” 
I say. 

She inspects her fingernails, 
comes to a quick decision, licks her 
lips wolfishly. 

“Government trainee,” she says 
in a low voice but so naturally, that 
is to say pretend-naturally, that Cas- 
sie (who is lying on a bunk, holding 
to one ear a cheap, battery-powered 
music library that will wear out 
within days, I can tell) can’t hear 
us. 

“At what?” say I. 

“Doesn’t matter,” she says shar- 
ply. “Not to tell. And I shan’t now, 
not because it matters but because it 
doesn’t.” 

For a moment she’s a death’s- 
head. 

Then “What!” says Lori 
Graham, a little desperately, with 
the natural irritation of someone 
whose Mummy and Daddy may, af- 
ter all, have been eaten by 
megatheria. “Nothing,” answers 
Nathalie. “Go on screwing with 
Alan or whatever it is you were do- 
ing.” (Lori makes a disgusted face 
and Alan turns aside to blush or 
giggle.) “If he can,” she adds. In 
the low, trained voice, she says to 
me, “Who are you.” 

“A musicologist,” I say. “Sorry. 
Nobody like you. I’ve picked things 
up because I’ve traveled a lot, that’s 
all.” 

Cassie sits up, shaking her radio. 
She says to Nathalie, “Can you do 
something with this thing?” 

“The batteries are worn down 

21 




and they’re electric; we can’t re- 
charge them. You’ve been playing 
that ever since we started this trip 
and you’ve probably played it be- 
fore, quite a lot. I know you’ve re- 
charged them but the case is worn. 
So that’s probably two hundred 
hours and a couple of rechargings; 
they do deteriorate each time, you 
know. And there’s nothing we can 
do — our gadgets are all sealed and 
shielded. It’s a different kind of 
energy; we can’t transform the one 
to the other. Besides if we tried 
opening any of the powerpacks, 
we’d probably go boom, you know, 
just like the ship.” This is me. I 
add, “I’m awfully sorry, Cassie.” 

“So if you’re a goddamn music 
student,” says Cassie at her most 
insulting, “where’s your goddamn 
music, huh?” 

I’m tempted to answer “in the 
ionosphere” (reduced to its con- 
stituent atoms or even smaller 
pieces) but I say, “It was in the 
baggage compartment . ” 

“Oh,” says Alan, clearly disap- 
pointed. I guess he has been plan- 
ning on hearing some music. Cassie 
draws up her knees in the bunk, 
exasperated, and presses the side of 
her face against the sealed window. 

Alan adds in a friendly way, 
“Hey, don’t you have any of it 
with you?” Forgetting to be polite, 
that one. 

“Tapes,” I say. “Want to use 
them for ribbons? I have the 
amplifier and the recorder — see? 
they fit in my hand — but the speak- 
ers are too big. Two meters diame- 
ter. ’ ’ 

He opens his mouth, probably to 
inquire why a speaker has to be two 
meters across, but Lori — who is 

22 



very well educated, as her parents 
have been telling us for three 
weeks — breaks in importantly with 
a disquisition on the physical repro- 
duction of sound, and how the low- 
est musical note that can be heard 
by the human ear is 14 cycles per 
second and the lowest sounds that 
can be felt are even lower, and if 
you want a really good bass, say for' 
Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D 
Minor for Organ, or Vestal’s Elec- 
tronic Mass, you just have to have 
these enormous speakers for your 
sound environment because other- 
wise the sounds just won’t fit 
mechanically on the speakers. “Lit- 
erally, ’’"she says. 

“0-o-oh,” says Alan in mock 
awe. 

Cassie breaks in furiously with, 
“Your goddamn education — ” 

(John Ude has been asleep all this 
time, worn out, poor man; that’s 
why you haven’t heard from him.) 

Thank God the Grahams come 
back in. The air-lock jams. We are 
now testing the atmosphere just as 
much as they, something Mr. Ude 
(waked by the noise of Lori’s re- 
joicings and questionings) seems to 
notice, but nobody’s going to call 
attention to such things in the pre- 
sence of an hysterical twelve-year- 
old with the habit of psychosomatic 
vomiting. (Her Momma says.) 

Joy all around. 

(I’m not, of course, recording 
this at the time it happened. I stole 
half-an-hour from the long, long 
dawn. Two and a half hours of 
twilight, then three more of real 
dark, and again two and a half 
hours of dusk-turned backward: 
slow, creeping, endless, unadvanc- 
ing grey.) 



GALAXY 




We’re very high on the world’s 
shoulder. Labrador perhaps. Even 
with the Pole circle. If the sun goes 
lower, if it sets closer to the place 
of its rising, if the dark shrinks, if 
red-sunset evolves without darkness 
into red-sunrise. Is this Spring? 
Summer? Fall? We might be head- 
ing into a ten-month summer, a 
twenty-year summer. Desert? Every- 
thing dead, brown, burned? Think 
anyway of midwinter with the sun 
even lower and only three hours of 
daylight out of twenty-eight. A 
night twenty-five hours long. 

In the brief, black, real dark we 
all went outside to look at the sky. 
A shiver of the nerves as the night 
air struck us, a kind of blind claus- 
trophilia, wishing to get back into 
our own, closed-in, stale smell, 
away from the living odors of night 
coolness. Everyone stayed together. 
Black velvet, must be overcast; this 
awful sense of being outside. Vast 
space. 

We looked up. 

Nothing. 

I mean there was almost nothing 
in the sky: a few bright stars near 
the zenith and halfway to the 
equatorial horizon a far, faint, dim 
blur. Island universes. From any- 
where on Earth (they say) you can 
see about three thousand stars with 
the naked eye. You can also see that 
arch of powder which we call the 
Milky Way; it’s the center of the 
galaxy. We’re located in one of its 
arms; it’s a kind of flattened ellipse. 
From anywhere near any galaxy, 
unless one is very far above or be- 
low its major plane, and in the 
wrong hemisphere to boot, you 
ought to be able to see something. 
Not that it matters, of course, for 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



space travel. Still. Nothing matched 
the star maps Nathalie had (she 
would!) but then on the other side 
of the equator, who knows? And 
none of us is very good at this sort 
of thing. But six stars and a 
blur. .which might be, God 
knows, the Crab Nebula or our 
own, or unidentified astronomical 
object number goodness-knows- 
what, something so far away, (as I 
said) the light of our dying will 
reach you (whoever you are) only 
after you yourselves are long dead, 
after your own Sun has engulfed 
you and then shrunk to a collapsed 
cinder with no more light in it than 
what we saw that night. 

Whoever, wherever, whenever. 

Lori cried in her mother’s arms. 
Mrs. Graham very clumsy at com- 
forting her daughter, perhaps always 
was. John the professor of the his- 
tory of ideas saying something like 
“Uhl” low, a sort of groan. 

That empty. 

Well, we might be visited in a 
routine check of the tagged worlds 
in as little as a couple of centuries, 
a century, eighty years even. Even 
little Lori will be dead. 

John Ude said, “Come on now, 
come on, dears. It’s a tagged 
planet. It has to be. Too much 
coincidence otherwise, eh? The air, 
the gravity. Now if it’s tagged, that 
means it’s like Earth. And we know 
Earth. Most of us were bom on it. 
So what’s there to be afraid of, 
hey? We’re just colonizing a little 
early, that’s all. You wouldn’t be 
afraid of Earth, would you?’’ 

Oh, sure. Think 6f Earth. Kind 
old home. Think of the Arctic. Of 
Labrador. Of Southern India in 
June. Think of smallpox and plague 

23 




and earthquakes and ringworm and 
pit vipers. Think of a nice case of 
poison ivy all over, including your 
eyes. Status Asthmaticus. Amoebic 
dysentery. The Minnesota pioneers 
who tied a rope from the house to 
the barn in winter because you 
could lose your way in a blizzard 
and die three feet from the house. 
Think (while you’re at it) of 
tsunamis, liver fluke, the Asian 
brown bear. Kind old home. The 
sweetheart. The darling place. 

Think of Death Valley. .in Au- 
gust. 

★ * * 

Day two. It began. I just couldn’t 
keep my damned mouth shut. 
Everybody running around cheerily 
into the Upper Paleolithic. We’re 
going to build huts. We’re going to 
have a Village Fire that Lori 
Graham will tend because she is the 
Fire Virgin or something. Mrs. 
Graham is suddenly person-of- 
least- value. Victor says, “Excuse 
me, dear,’’ with immense firmness 
and then goes about his business. 
He’s going to go somewhere with 
John Ude to search for water. They 
won’t drink it, of course, but will 
carry back samples and then we will 
analyze it, which is impossible, be- 
cause we don’t have the equipment. 
But it will certainly help the water- 
distiller; our tanks are almost emp- 
ty. Mrs. Graham has suddenly be- 
come very cuddly with Lori, who 
keeps squirming away, saying, 
“Valeria, please'." With twenty- 
five hours of daylight there’s no 
rush, and besides we have to move 
everything outside (to find out if 
that will kill us). Outside it goes, 

24 



mattresses and bedding (to get 
rained on or infested), tools and 
tool-kit, all of this superficially 
showing immense order but in fact 
about as rational as the ooze of al- 
gae from a pond. Our nice, destruc- 
tible laboratory (like litmus paper, 
use it once and it’s done for) has 
told us that the sun will not burn 
us, although it has a small amount 
of ultra-violet, and more than the 
usual infra-red (too low in the sky, 
anyhow); that the local vegetation 
does not contain mineral poisons; 
that the (local) air does not, either; 
and that the gravitation is 0.93, 
which is so close to terrestrial as 
makes no difference. 

Nathalie’s digging experimental 
sanitation pits with a collapsible 
shovel. And every once in a while 
it does. 

I seek out Ude, who’s unpacking 
the first-aid kit, and say, “Benze- 
drine and bobby-pins!’’ but the 
joke’s too old for either of us to 
have ever heard it, and too vulgar, 
base, and popular for him to have 
ever read it. 

I say, “Look, you’ve got an 
anti-pyretic, two wide-spectrum an- 
tibiotics, pain-killers, and a nice lit- 
tle pamphlet about how to make a 
splint out of a bunk-rail. It’s not 
enough." 

“We’ll make do,” he said hearti- 
ly, flashing The Smile. 

I said, “My God, man, what will 
you do when Lori’s wisdom teeth 
come in?” and the child, who must 
have clairaudience (she was a good 
five meters away) instantly emitted 
a nervous “What!” and came over 
to join us. She had been watching 
Alan Bobby Whitehouse ponder 
about trying to start to learn to just 



GALAXY 




possibly -swing an axe without cut- 
ting his own foot. 

“Your impacted wisdom teeth,” 
I said. “Everybody gets impacted 
wisdom teeth. I’m the only adult I 
know whose wisdom teeth came in 
straight. Of course I had gingivitis, 
and dental surgery, and fillings, and 
your mother has transplants. So 
where are we going to get all this?” 

“Huh?” said Lori. 

“They might just lie there for 
years,” I said. “I know someone 
who didn’t get them until they were 
thirty. On the other hand, you 
might have intense pain for a month 
before they die and rot inside your 
gums and take a couple of molars 
with them, which Daddy can knock 
out with a rock.” 

“O pioneers,” 1 added rather 
sourly. 

“Now come on,” said John Ude. 

(Funny. Everyone’s around us 
now. I’ve attracted a crowd. The 
old raise- the- voice bit. And I wasn’t 
even thinking of it.) I said, “I don’t 
want to make a speech — ” 

“Then don’t,” said Cassie, 
who’s been flapping our linens in 
the breeze, just to make sure we get 
a nice dose of the local pollens. 

“Well, fuck you then!” I said. 
“I will.” 

And I did. I must have talked for 
five or six minutes. I told them (and 
more): 

That a tagged planet is not col- 
onizable but means only bearable 
gravity, a decent temperature 
range, and air that wont kill you. 

That survey teams sample only 
one square kilometer of a planet, 
doubtless not this one. 

That there were no mineral 
poisons, but that we couldn't test

for organics or allergens. 

That there could be incompatible 
proteins, vitamin deficiencies, 
chelating agents, dozens of things 
that could mess us up biologically 
in dozens of ways. 

That if we could eat the local 
macro-life, the local micro-life 
could eat us. 

That we could die of exposure in 
the winter because we had no way 
to make heat after our bungalow 
wore out and that was in six 
months. 

That we could die of heat in a 
summer whose length we didn’t yet 
know. 

That a breech birth could kill. 
That a three-days’ labor and no di- 
lation could kill. That septicemia 
could kill. 

That heart failure could kill. 

That none of us could even rec- 
ognize flint, let alone know what to 
do with it. 

That plastic was a lousy building 
material. 

That each of us carried five to 
eight lethal genes, and that even 
without them, humanity had not 
exactly been breeding for survival 
for the past hundred years. 

That there weren’t enough of us. 

And more. So much more. 

I stopped. Too much of the old 
stiff-necked pride coming back. 
Giant Alan Bobby, with his axe, 
says, “I think you better go on,” 
and I only hope Nathalie’s training 
has included eye-gouging and 
larynx-smashing because this boy is 
beginning to find out — in two 
days! — that we are far, far from any 
law. I hope he can be shamed. I 
said: 

“Well, I hope we find volcanic 

26 



glass, because I could recognize 
that; I saw it once in a museum.” 

This falls flat. 

“What do you suggest we do?” 
says the Professor, with The Smile. 
“You seem to think we have no 
chance.” Humor her. 

I nodded. 

The professor repeated, “Just 
what do you suggest we do?” 

Silence. 

“Well, anything you please,” I 
said. “Only leave me out of it.” 

“That,” says Nathalie, “will 
make three women and two men, if 
we exclude Victor, which puts the 
numbers considerably lower, 
doesn’t it?” 

“Jesus,” I said; “Oh Jesus 
Christ, I’m forty-two years old. Do 
you think I can have my first child 
now? Besides you don’t want me; 
my father was a bleeder.” 

“Liar,” says Nathalie. “I saw 
your medical records. You’re not 
the only one who can get past the 
crew doors.” 

“All right,” I said. (Nathalie the 
leader. Wait til Alan finds out he 
can beat you up.) “All right, so 
you think you have the chance of a 
snowball in hell. Maybe you do. 
But / think that some kinds of sur- 
vival are damned idiotic. Do you 
want your children to live in the 
Old Stone Age? Do you want them 
to forget how to read? Do you want 
to lose your teeth? Do you want 
your great-grandchildren to die at 
thirty? That’s obscene.” 

Here the ground came up and hit 
me, as it always does when you get 
carried away; it was Cassie, stand- 
ing over me and shouting, “Shut 
up! Shut up, you!” I don’t think 
she hit me, only pushed. I wasn’t 

GALAXY 




ready, that’s all. Rabble-rousing 
that used to work, but that doesn’t 
work now because it’s the wrong 
rabble and the wrong rouse. Well, 
we all know that. 

And in everyone’s face the flash 
of realization: no law. 

John Ude said, “Come, come, 
dears, don’t lose your temper. 
She’ll get over it. Nathalie, what do 
you carry?’’ And the whole thing 
was over. 

Much later Cassie, her face grey 
in the grey dusk, woke me acciden- 
tally. She’s hunting in the first-aid 
kit, her face drawn. 

She says, “Oh, you\ Go back to 
sleep.’’ 

I said, “What’s the matter?’’ 

“Migraine,” she said. “I lost my 
pills. But this stuff is no good.” 
(The last with a little wail; I judged 
it hadn’t come on yet, maybe just 
the flashes of light or whatever it is 
she gets first.) I said, “Hold on,” 
and fished something out of my 
belt. Should help. 

“So what’s that, cyanide?” she 
whispered, closing her eyes as if to 
concentrate. It must be starting. 

“No,” I said. ”it’s like your 
pills. Better than that all-purpose 
painkiller nonsense, anyway. Go 
on.” I held them out in my palm. 

“Bet it’s poison,” she said, but 
she took it. I saw her feel her way 
to the water-dispenser over the un- 
even ground, cup a little water in 
her hand, and throw her head back. 
She came back and lay down on the 
mattress, out under the nothing sky. 
Still clear. Still no stars. One keeps 
getting the oddest feeling that it 
must be cloudy, though we’ve only 
seen morning fog. The temperature 
doesnt go down much at night. 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



There’s too much light, though; it’s 
like living naked. Sometimes this 
place looks like a stage set or a lit- 
tle alleyway or back yard of some- 
body’s familiar country home; only 
in the true dark does it become real. 

(Like the Australian outback, as I 
told them in my great lecture, 
which looks like New Jersey and 
can kill you in two hours.) 

She said, “What happens now, I 
blow up?” She cocked an eyebrow 
at me. 

“No,” I said, smiling (I couldn’t 
help it). “The pain stops, and if it 
doesn’t you won’t care; it’s got a 
euphoric in it, too.” 

“Ooh, I’m gonna get high,” she 
said. “Jollies. .” (Taking hold al- 
ready?) “Say, hon, how come you 
carry all that stuff?” 

I explained: it’s better than 
money. And you never know. 

“All you’d need is a jack-knife,” 
she said, “if you feel like cutting 
your throat, which is a goddamn 
cowardly thing to do, if you don’t 
mind my saying so.” 

“Goodnight,” I said, and turned 
over. I wasn’t facing her any more. 

“Hey!” (comes the voice at my 
back) “You really want to kill 
yourself? You like getting hurt?” 

“Yes, I want to do it before I get 
didded,” I said. “And no. No fol- 
lows from yes.” 

She chuckled sleepily. “Sorry I 
hit you. Forgive me, huh? What’s 
you said about the whozis and the 
old guy?” 

(The old guy preached a sermon 
in his shroud a week before his 
death. The whozis were the North- 
men; they used to say Deliver us 
from fire, plague, the fury of the 
Northmen, and sudden death. Those 



27 




crazy people who took months to 
die. They had things to think 
about.) 

“Go to sleep,” I said. “Dream 
about your migraines.” 

And all the other things. Such a 
beautiful world, really. But no 
music, no friends. If Earth had been 
hit by plague, by fire, by war, by 
radiation, sterility, a thousand 
things, you name it. I’d still stand 
by her; I love her; I would fight ev- 
ery inch of the way there because 
my whole life is knit to her. And 
she’d need mourners. To die on a 
dying Earth — I’d live, if only to 
weep. 

But this stranger has never seen 
us before. She says; Hey, what are 
you funny little things? We are (O 
listeners, note) one quarter the 
height of the trees, we are hairless, 
give birth to our young alive, are 
bipedal with two manipulating 
limbs, have binocular vision, we 
regulate our internal temperatures 
by the slow oxidation of various 
compounds (food) and we live no 
more than a century at the very, 
very most (at least it feels that way, 
as the joke goes) and we are caught 
rather nastily, very badly, and 
sometimes even comically, between 
different aspirations. That is the 
fault of the cerebral cortex. (People 
are turning over, sighing, mumbling 
in their sleep, as the light slowly 
grows.) 

Note: ars moriendi is Latin. It is 
a lost skill. It is ridiculed and is 
practiced by few. 

It is very, very important. 

It is the art of dying.

Day Three. Alan-Bobby found a 
medallion among my personal ef- 
fects (he was sorting everyone’s; 
somehow they haven’t gone looking 
for water yet) and being a nice, 
obedient little boy, took it to Victor 
Graham, who took it to John Ude. 

“What is it?” said they (in 
chorus, as I imagine). 

He told them. He came over to 
me (I was making a deck of playing 
cards from Mrs. Graham’s collec- 
tion of antique post cards by first 
trying to peel the backs off) and 
swung the medallion at me, just far 
enough away so I couldn’t grab it. 
Picture one early Christian, sitting 
cross-legged on the ground with lap 
covered by bedsheets, in case the 
cards didn’t work out, and one 
professor — but not John Donne — 
who has decided to Tease. 

“Now we know!” said John 
Ude, looking much less cosmopoli- 
tan than before. 

“That? That’s not mine,” I said. 
(When in doubt, deny.) 

“Come! Who cares?” he said. 
(Alan and Victor have gone back to 
whatever they were doing; I’m sure 
he asked them to leave “so I can 
get her to talk” or something.) “Be 
anything you like. Only it explains 
what happened yesterday, and if I 
explain to everyone else, they might 
feel a little better about you.” 

“You mean they’ll dismiss me as 
a nut,” I said. “All right, it’s 
mine.” He held it out to me, but I 
really have no particular use for the 
thing, and the metal chain might be 
use^l to someone else. I said: 

“Look, it’s only a symbol. You 
know, the quartered circle, symbol 
of Earth and all that. Keep it. Use 
the chain.”

“Don’t you want it?” 

“No. It’s only a piece of jewel- 
ry-” 

“Then you’re not. .?” 

“I am. But I don’t use the Tarot, 
believe in the I Ching, tell fortunes, 
make sacrifices, have rituals, be- 
lieve in the Bible — not literally, 
anyway — the Tao Te Ching, or any- 
thing else. So keep it.” 

“An apostate!” he said. 

“Oh, don’t be silly.” And I went 
on trying my fingernails on the post 
cards. Don’t see why she can’t col- 
lect holovision cubes like everyone 
else. Have to use sheets, anyway. I 
said, “Do you know how to play 
poker?” 

But he had levered himself down 
on the grass next to me. No poison 
ivy so far. I said; 

“Well, when are you guys going 
to find water?” 

“A Trembler,” he said. “My 
God, a Trembler in our very 
midst.” I shut my eyes.. 

“The Quakers,” I said, “called 
themselves the Society of Friends. 
They were called Quakers because 
some fool heard John Fox say he 
quaked in the presence of his God. 
Actually I like to think of myself as 
a tremblor. Never mind.” 

“But you tremble.” 

“Oh, all the time.” 

“Do you believe in God?” 

“No.” 

“But you believe in something?” 
“Everywhere. Always. See Lao 
Tse: Tao is in the excrement, in the 
broken tile. Cleave the rock and 
there am I. Now go away.” 

“But tell me,” he said, profes- 
sional passion rising, “what does 
your church — ” 

“No church.” 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



“Well, what do you say about — 
about, say, sex?” 

“Nothing.” 

Mrs. Graham, within earshot, 
having found that the tool chest was 
water-tight by filling it with water 
and having Lori take a bath in it, 
along with most of our clothes, 
caught guess-what-word. She wiped 
her hands free of suds and strolled 
over. 

“May I join you?” 

“I’m asking,” said John Donne, 
“what the Tremblers have to say 
about sex.” 

“Oh, that,” said Mrs. Graham, 
looking knowing. It was real know- 
ledge, too; you’d think Cassie, with 
her silver nipples, was the expert, 
but I think Cassie’s frigid. She only 
sells it. Mrs. G has been a buyer 
and buyers do what buyers want. 

“Well, what do they say?” says 
Valeria. 

“Nothing,” I said. “Look, Mrs. 
Graham, I think you’d better keep 
your post cards to entertain your 
great-grandchildren. My fingers hurt 
and besides, there’s no reason to 
sacrifice them; they’re entertaining. 
I’ll cut up a sheet.” 

“And about—” 

“Look, John,” I said, “we are 
not a church, only an attitude. Our 
principal subjects are work and mor- 
tality, not fucking. On those two I 
could tell you a lot but you heard it 
all yesterday and didn’t like it. So 
why don’t you get Nathalie to acti- 
vate the broomstick and let her go 
look for water on it? It’s a hell of a 
lot faster than walking.” 

“No, one of us will have to go,” 
said he, “unless Mrs. Graham can 
drive. .?” 

“You see,” he went, “Nathalie’s 

29 




life and yours and Lori’s and Cas- 
sie’s are too valuable to put in 
danger. You are childbearers. What 
does your religion say about that?’ ’ 

“Genetic drift — ’’ I said. 

“Civilization must be preserved,’’ 
says he. 

“Civilization’s doing fine,’’ I 
said. “We just don’t happen to be 
where it is.’’ 

“Your church—’’ 

“My religion,’’ said I, rising 
from my cross-legged position 
without uncrossing my legs (which 
rather surprised him, but it’s easy 
for short people) “says a lot about 
power. Bad things! It says thou 
owest God a death. It says that the 
first thing a sane civilization does 
with cryogenic corpses is to pull the 
plug on those damned popsicles, 
and if you want to live forever you 
are dreadfully dangerous because 
you’re not living now. It says that 
you must die, because otherwise 
how can you be saved? It says that 
without meaningful work you might 
as well be dead. It also says death 
hurts. And it says if you try to be 
strong and perfect and good and 
powerful, you’re a damned fool and 
liar and the truth is not in you. So 
don’t try my patience. It also says 
God is in you and you are in God 
as the fish is in the sea and the sea 
is in the fish. Saint Theresa. It also 
says—’’ 

“You’re a remarkably eclectic 
bunch,’’ said John Ude, laughing. 
“Do you believe all this stolen 
theology?’ ’ 

“Why not?” I said. “I stole it 
myself.” 

“Anyway, that’s your field,” I 
added. He laughed. Indulgently. 

“I’ll spread the word,” he said.

He walked off — even a twenty- 
five-hour day ends eventually — and 
happened to pass by Lori in the tool 
chest, who crossed her arms over 
herself with great rapidity and 
looked sheer murder at him. Odd 
mores: body paint’s O.K. but ba- 
thing is private. Surrounded by 
clothes, too, all colors, bobbing 
about in the water. Barely room 
enough for the lot of them, her 
knees under her chin. 

Mrs. Graham said, “Do you be- 
lieve in life after death?” 

“No,” I said. 

“Oh. And when was the last time 
you slept with anyone?” I stared at 
her. She did no even look much in- 
terested. 

I shrugged. “Years ago. Dunno. 
A long time.” 

“And you're living in the pre- 
sent?” site said, raising her eye- 
brows. “Well!” Valeria Victrix. My 
God, yes, she must have been. In 
her own element. 

“There’s other things,” I said. 

“Like—?” 

“Oh look, Mrs. G — ” 

“Don’t call me Mrs. Gee,” she 
said. It’s tasteless, don’t you think? 
Call me Valerie. And tell me what 
all those wonderful other things are, 
besides sex. And money. Because 
you can turn money into anything, 
you know.” 

Ah. I’m at the bottom of the 
pecking order now. Well, there are 
worse places, like the top. Inciting 
to riot. Destroying government 
property. (Symbolic?) I got arrested 
and was in Jail overnight but I cer- 
tainly wasn’t at the center of it. No 
doubt one of those thirty-year cycles 
of rebellion Our Man John writes 
about. And as if they had no con- 

GALAXY 




nection with physical fact. At the 
bottom you can hide effectively. I 
said: 

“I was a Communist. I was in 
the ‘twenties riots. Not very impor- 
tant, mind you, but it seemed to be 
going somewhere.” 

‘‘Just after hydrogen fusion,” 
said she. ‘‘Which took the steam 
out of your sails, didn’t it? And 
made me rich. So you’re a Com- 
munist. Good Heavens! And a 
Trembler, too? I thought they didn’t 
go together.” 

‘‘They do,” I said. ‘‘Very well. 
And I’d prefer it if you called me 
what we call ourselves: 
Nobodies — I’m Nobody, who are 
you? Are you Nobody, too? How 
nice. Which is no bar to being a 
Communist. Which I was.” 

‘‘You’re not one any longer?” 
she said. 

‘‘Mrs. Gee,” I said, ‘‘None of us 
is anything any longer.” 

‘‘Frigid bitch,” she said, step- 
ping back. I said, ‘‘Oh, call me a 
salad, why don’t you, that makes as 
much sense. And think of what I 
could call you.” 

‘‘Motherrr!” (Lori) She’s tired of 
intimacies with everybody’s wash- 
ing. 

‘‘Oh, Valeria,” I went on, ‘‘the 
heart is deceitful and desperately 
wicked, who can know it?” (She 
doesn’t recognize, thinks I’m 
crazy.) I said, more prosaically, ‘‘If 
you bother me again. I’ll poison 
Lori’s mind against you.” 

She got up slowly, saying, ‘‘At 
least I remember that I had some- 
thing,” and went to pull Lori out of 
the washtub: A sensible woman, re- 
ally, but she’s going to learn she 
has no money here. I yelled, ‘‘Hey, 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



don’t bug Victor, he’s bigger’n 
you!” 

‘‘Victor Graham is my father,” 
cried Lori, reaching with a glass for 
the cold-water dispenser, to rinse 
herself. ‘‘Agh!” she cried. She 
shouted at me, ‘‘My father would 
never do anything wrong!” 

‘‘Absolutely, love!” I shouted 
back. That child will grow up in a 
perfect mess of illusions. 

Did grow up. 

George Fox went to jail because 
he could not forbear rushing into 
Anglican services and denouncing 
their priesthood as mummery; he 
said the great bell struck upon his 
heart. I was not there, of course; 
read it in a book. The scores of 
thousands of books and musical 
compositions that are preserved in 
nitrogen at the British Museum in 
London. Prisoners and political 
exiles write books. Would you write 
a book if you were alone on a de- 
sert island? Would you scratch in 
the sand? 

Note: we communicate by organs 
which produce vibrations in the air 
(gaseous medium). We hear, rough- 
ly, sounds from 14 to 8,000 cycles 
per second. ‘‘Sound” is a series 
of concentric rings made of the 
rarefaction and compression of air, 
water, or some other medium. We 
can’t exist completely submerged in 
water (this may come as a shock to 
you)as the oxygen we use in our 
metabolisms comes out of the air. 
We’re not equipped the other way. 
We draw air into ourselves and 
push it out. We are extremely 
fragile, propaganda to the contrary. 
‘‘Speaking” comes from a different 
place than “breathing.” You must 
understand this. Those marks, “ ”,

indicate speech. Communication. 
You must listen. You must under- 
stand that the patriarchy is coming 
back, has returned (in fact) in two 
days. By no design. You must un- 
derstand that I have no music, no 
books, no friends, no love. No 
civilization without industrialization! 
I’m very much afraid of death. But 
I must. I must. 1 must. 

Deliver me from the body of this. 
This body. This damned life. 

* * * 

Day four. Nathalie finally went 
off on the broomstick because no- 
body knew how to operate it but 
she and I. I was not allowed, natur- 
ally. I relented and showed Alan- 
Bobby how to use the axe without 
cutting off his feet. He. took it away 
from me. He was cutting wood and 
so was Mr. Graham, with the little 
hand hatchet; when they managed to 
collect some branches, they lit them 
to see if they could make a fire. 
Bravo! It burned. And the smoke 
gave Lori a violent allergic reaction; 
she ran away clawing at her throat, 
crying, viciously rotating her fingers 
in her ears, and making the tongue 
motions of someone trying (ineffec- 
tually) to scratch her soft palate. 
Perfect for the long winter eve- 
nings. So they put the fire out. 

Mrs. Graham played gin with 
Mr. Graham, with the cards I’d 
made from bed-linen; she kept beat- 
ing him. 

Then she played gin with John 
Ude and kept beating him. 

He said he wished to walk about, 
still being gracious; Mrs. G tried to 
get Mr. G back into playing. He 
said, “I don’t wish to.” 

32 



‘‘But I want to, dear,” said Val- 
eria quietly. (A simple, domestic 
request, repeated many times; Val- 
eria in blue and gold, the nail of her 
left little finger a gold sheath, in- 
ches long. Victor in blue, the even- 
ing game, Mrs. Graham saying, 
‘‘Get me a drink, dear,” and Victor 
eager and compliant. Now I know.) 

Victor got up and went to talk to 
Alan-Bobby, who chuckled and 
nodded; then they got really seri- 
ous, about drainage ditches or log 
cabins, or burning other wood, for 
Victor would not hurt his daughter, 
that I do know, not for the world. 

Something odd about Valeria’s 
face. See, Victrix? 

She said, ‘‘Lori, I’m afraid your 
silly father has given you hives.” 
‘‘Daddy isn’t silly,” (says oblivi- 
ous young Graham, cleaning her 
toenails with a complicated spiral 
device that was apparently part of 
her personal baggage) ‘‘and I don’t 
think you should ask him to play 
cards if he doesn’t want to. You 
can be awfully mean,, Mother.” 

I walked over to — no, I thought 
of walking over — 

She came over to me. ‘‘Do you 
play gin?” I shook my head. 

‘‘You see how they treat me,” 
and she tossed back that old-young 
face, that surgically lifted neck, 
with hair that has begun to come in 
gray at the roots. It’s a beautiful 
gesture and I myself would be quite 
content simply to admire it, no mat- 
ter the age of the one who makes it, 
but I don’t think the men will feel 
the same way. 

‘‘Oh, they’re bored,” I said. 
‘‘It’s nothing. Cultural reversion. 
We’re in the late nineteenth century 
is all. Do you want to bet how far 



GALAXY 




back we’ll be next week? Five to 
ten it’ll be the eighth, A.D.” 

“You’re crazy,’’ said Mrs. 
Graham, not without affection, and 
went into the bungalow to make 
friends with Cassie. 

1 hid the crucial parts of my 
pharmacopoeia under a rock, in the 
tin box I will use for the vocoder, 
eventually. I thought of telling them 
I’m a vegetarian, just to make them 
discount even more of what I do 
(and they would!) but I couldn’t do 
it with a straight face. 

An endless afternoon. 

John Ude: “You play Go? 
Chess?’’ I said No, dunno why, 
never learned. 

Lori remarked that she didn’t see 
what was wrong with the Australian 
outback because she’d been there, 
in the special hotel, and it was 
very, very nice. 

I donate my mini-sewing-kit to 
the communal possesions heap. 

Finally, after Cassie had walked 
six ways around a bedsheet, decid- 
ing how to cut it up and sew it for 
herself, after everyone had 
memorized the kind of tree whose 
burning had made Lori sick (“This 
is very important” said her father), 
after Lori said, “Oh, I am like to 
die of tedium” only a dozen times, 
before we all went mad — 

Nathalie returned on the 
broomstick, covered with dust. 
There’s running water not far from 
here, that way (she gestures) which 
rises (she says) in a spring some 
two hundred kilometers to the 
North, in hilly country, and passes 
us only a couple of km. away. 

“Did you have to go all that 
way?” says Alan-Bobby, in grave 
complaint. “We’ve been waiting.”

She throws oyer her shoulder, ‘ ‘Of 
course I had to,” and sponging off 
the mask near the water tank, starts 
drawing on one of my playing cards 
where the stream is, where we are, 
and in which direction everything 
is. “North” is provincial. She 
means Pole-wards. At this time of 
year you can’t tell East or West 
from the sun; though perhaps the 
sunset (a little to the right) and the 
sunrise (a little to the left) could tell 
us if we are facing North or South. 
Arbitrary. I study it very carefully. 

“Will you Just stop that!” cries 
Nathalie furiously, for Alan is tak- 
ing a bath in the tool chest, a real 
bath (insofar as he can fit in) and 
singing lustily, though nothing rec- 
ognizable. He’s tune-deaf. Nathalie 
shouts, “Goddamn it, you’re wast- 
ing water!” 



33 




“But we’ve got water,” says he, 
bewildered. “You just said so.” 

“We’ve got the raw material for 
the distiller,” she said. “That’s all. 
We haven’t even measured the flow 
yet. Now get out of there!” 

He does, tipping the soapy water 
on to the ground, where it might 
make the grass wither or blow up 
(but it doesn’t) and prepares to fill 
the tool box again. 

“You. .!” says Nathalie, white. 
“You imbecile!” 

“I don’t think,” says Alan, slow- 
ly, like a man to whom a new idea 
has just occurred, “that you ought 
to talk to me like that.” 

“We could’ve put that back 
through the distiller!” (Which is 
what we’ve been doing with our 
chemical toilet.) 

“I think you are much too bos- 
sy,” says Alan, sponging himself 
off with the few inches of cold wa- 
ter in the tool chest. He’s looking at 
the ground and something’s happen- 
ing in his head. 

John Ude has backed off, smiling 
nervously. Victor’s frowning. 

Nobody likes her, not Cassie, not 
Mrs. Gee, not her husband, certain- 
ly. Lori and I don’t count. 

Dried off and in his shorts, Alan 
advances up to dirty, dust-streaked 
Nathalie, who has always been Top. 
He looks sly. 

“Say, how come you’re boss?” 
he says. 

“Brains,” she says. “How come 
you’re such a damn fool?” 

“I could take you over my knee 
and spank you,” he says. 

Nobody is interfering. 

“Idiot,” says she. Clearly, in 
government training schools, people 
don’t do these things. 

34 



She turns her back on him, su- 
perbly. 

“Look, nobody else can fly that 
thing,” I say, very quickly. “And 
since you won’t let me because you 
don’t trust me, you’d better — ” 

“Turn around,” he says. ■ 

She props the broomstick against 
a tree, stripping off her shirt and 
beating the dust out of it. 

“Turn around, you bitch!” he 
says. 

Surprised, she does. Not even 
afraid. Only surprised. 

And Alan Bobby, who could 
probably uproot a tree, with those 
shoulders and arms and that neck, 
and the little face in between look- 
ing peculiarly lost — but very angry 
now — socks her right in the jaw, 
knocking her down. 

He’s red. He says, “Maybe now 
you’ll treat other people with re- 
spect. Now that you know there’s 
other people in the world.” 

She whispers, sprawled on the 
ground, white as one of my playing 
cards, “You bloody, blazing, im- 
possible ass — ” 

He hits her powerfully on the 
side of the face, snapping her head 
about. 

“That’s enough,” says Victor, 
he and John Ude, by some mysteri- 
ous calculus, speaking almost at the 
same moment, and each coming 
forward to hold one arm of this 
baby colossus. Enough for what? 
Alan looks happy. I mean it: not 
triumphant, not overbearing, simply 
happy. He glows. The twenty-first 
century can’t have been kind to this 
enormous fellow, and now he’s dis- 
covering other interesting things to 
do: chopping down trees, lifting 
rock with his bare hands, fighting, 

GALAXY 




knocking down women. Too bad 
he’s so young; Victor Graham now, 
there’s a hypertensive if I ever saw 
one; once his medication mns out, 
we might do a job like the old 
Jewish story: the rabbi and the 
Count both tied to chairs, alone in 
the Count’s cellar for a whole night, 
and in the morning the rabbi serene 
and fresh and the Count a dead 
man. Apoplexy. 

But Alan’s useful. 

Any day now he’ll discover Pro- 
tecting Women. I hope. 

Valeria Victrix got the first-aid 
kit and she and I anointed and ban- 
daged Nathalie, who was still 
shaking — more from anger than 
from shock. Cassie pushed us aside, 
claiming she could do it better. She 
was right. 

I said, “Nathalie, I thought a 
government trainee would know — ’’ 

“I will, I will,’’ she said. 

“My God, why didn’t you 
duck?” I said. “Or just drop under 
his punch? Or give him a good 
knee-over when you were on your 
back? Or stick your fingers in his 
eyes?” 

Well, he had surprised her. Cas- 
sie thought any woman who even 
got into such a position was a fool 
to begin with. “Just tell him Lori is 
watching,” she said. “And cry a 
lot. You’re both cuckoo.” 

I said, “Look here, Nathalie, just 
how much training have you really 
had?” 

Silence. 

Of course. She was going to it, 
not coming yrow it. 

I said quickly, “Never mind. 
Don’t speak; your mouth is puffing 
up.” 

Sitting, holding rags soaked in 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



cold water to her face. Streaked 
with dirt. John, Victor, and Alan 
making ecstatic plans how to move 
everything nearer the stream. We go 
to bed when the sun reaches a cer- 
tain clump of trees; there’s hours of 
daylight yet to go and nobody can 
tell if the day is getting shorter or 
longer. It remains warm, too light, 
but better that than that dreadful, 
empty, black sky. 

You see the rewards of being 
Nobody. 

* * ★ 

The penalty: everybody comes to 
me for advice. Because my public 
word would not be trusted, I can be 
told anything privately. Alan whis- 
pers: 

“Hey, wake up. Please?” 

Dusk all around us. Scarlatti in 
my head. I said, “What?” 

“Are you awake?” he whispered. 
I mumbled something and opened 
my eyes. Dusk or dawn, every- 
body’s mattresses scattered all over 
the ground, farther apart than last 
night. I’ve got to get away from 
these insane people. Alan is lying by 
my mattress, on the damp ground, 
his woeful face propped in his 
hands. He says, in a low voice so 
as not to waken anyone: 

“Do you think what I did was 
really so bad?” 

“Yes,” I said. “Absolutely.” 
“Lori chewed me out something 
awful,” he said. “So did Mrs. 
Graham. And Cassie won’t speak to 
me.” 

I sat up. I said, “I bet Ude gave 
you a lecture on civilization and 
Vic said you’d have him to reckon 
with if you tried it again.” 



35 




“How’d you know!” 

‘‘Oh, just guessing,” I said. 
‘‘Well, do you think it was so 
bad?” Looking anxious. 

‘‘Yes. Now let me sleep. Git.” 
“Hell, you sound just like 
Nathalie! I’ll tell you, maybe it 
wasn’t right, but I bet it taught her 
something!” 

‘‘What did it teach her?” I said. 
‘‘Never to approach you without a 
broken bottle in her hand? Now 
Lori thinks you’re real sweet. And 
Vic Graham knows that some day 
you’re going to pull something like 
that on him. It taught us all to love 
and trust you. Right?” 

He sat back on his heels. He said 
sulkily, “I could do it to you, too, 
you know.” 

I said, ‘‘Really, Victor? Sorry — 
slip of the tongue,” and was on my 
feet, holding straight out in that 
treacherous light the screwdriver I 
had abstracted from the tool chest 
on day one. 

You surely don’t think I’m fool 
enough to walk about without a 
weapon, do you? i 
He reached for it and I gave his 
hand a good slash. He withdrew it, 
extremely astonished. 

“Oh, go away,’’ I said. “I 
haven’t the slightest intention of 
hurting you and you don’t have the 
slightest intention of really hurting 
me. You’re just showing off. 
You’re a good, big, strong, decent, 
beautiful man, and you can pride 
yourself on that all you like. But 
don’t forget; even though she’s 
exasperating, Nathalie is smart and 
if you start throwing your weight 
around, nobody else will like you 
and she’ll take advantage of that. 
Remember: you’re not stronger than 

36 



all of us put together. Besides, Lor- 
i’s stuck on you.” 

He lit up. “Yeah!” 

‘‘So go to sleep now, huh?” 

He said, ‘‘How old do you think 
Lori would have to be before she 
can have babies?” 

“Sixteen,” I said (guessing). 
‘‘Now go to sleep.” 

Day five: we’ll move everything 
nearer the river, like lemmings. 
Nathalie will start turning bruise- 
blue in the face. Alan will creep 
about like a wounded pup, os- 
tracized by all, scorned by Lori 
Graham, the worst burdens loaden 
on his back, meke as the knyght 
that suffereth for his ladye’s sake. 
Which won’t last. 

* * # 

Day five: we worked eighteen 
hours, slept, worked again. Alan 
has reverted to the intensely polite, 
self-suppressing youth everybody 
knew and loathed. My feet hurt. I 
tried to explain about orthopedic 
malfunctions and was told I was 
malingering. Then my ankles 
swelled out most satisfactorily in the 
evening, looking distressingly like 
small cantaloupes, and everyone 
was most apologetic. I said No, no, 
I had to carry my share. Then my 
ankles got even more so. Cassie 
washed them, the great nurse, sex- 
pot, earth-mother. We went to bed. 
She says: “Sssst!” 

Me: What? 

She: You ever had an orgasm? 
Me: Can’t remember. 

She: Liar. I mean during fucking. 
I never did. Women are all liars 
about it, like Vicki Graham. She just 
pretends, to show off, you know. 

GALAXY 




(Silence.) 

She; Ever want babies? 

Me; I dunno. Sort of. Not really. 

She; I do. 

(Silence.) 

She; They don’t let you, if you’re 
poor. But here — 

Me; I see. Well, good luck. How 
are you going to handle the men? 

She just laughed. Then she said 
with perfect certainty, “Those 
babies’ll love me, not their 
daddies.” she nudged me. “Hey, 
madhead, Ude and Graham are go- 
ing to take your pills away from 
you in the morning.” 

“And who told them, you bloody 
traitor!” said I. 

“Sssssh!” She looked around un- 
easily, then whispered, “I did.” 

She added, “But I told you first, 
didn’t I?” 

* « 

Day six; I am set upon from be- 
hind, bound, and searched, protest- 
ing indignantly. They slit the lining 
of my jacket (Cassie; “Oh, don’t 
take on so; I’ll sew it up again!”), 
violate my leather belt, (“Hey, 
look, it’s got pop-outs,” says 
Alan), and pinch my body-suit up 
and down (without me in it, of 
course). They collect all the 
psychedelics. I cry, very very hard. 
They free my hands so I can blow 
my nose and I whack Cassie, who 
looks startled. Then they let me put 
on my body-suit and Victor Graham 
stands very impressively in front of 
me, hands out; “More.” 

“Me?” I said. “Me have any- 
thing more? I swear — ” 

Finally I unscrew my left shoe- 
heel and give them Cassie’s 

WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



headache medicine. Then I unscrew 
my right shoe-heel and hand over a 
glass vial. Victor starts to crush the 
thing and this part of the scene is 
genuine, believe me, I yelled 
“Don’t! Stop!” 

Consternation. 

I said, “That’s lethal. It’s a nerve 
poison, works right through the 
skin. You don’t have to drink it. 
Victor! Just put it down. No, it’s 
not bio-degradable, so you can’t put 
it in the chemical toilet. Just leave 
it in the sun for a while. That’ll 
ruin it. But don't let anybody touch 
it. ' ’ 

Victor confers with John Ude, 
both of them gingerly handling the 
vial. Ude nods. I’ve told the truth. 
(And I have. What I did not tell 
them was how many more I’ve got 
hidden back at the old site.) I 
started to cry harder, which isn’t 
difficult because I’m thinking of 
how damned unfair it is that I shall 
never hear again my melancholy 
Dowland; semper Dowland, semper 
dolens. Ever Dowland, ever doleful. 
No tee-hee-hee-quoth-she for him. I 
notice through my tears that 
Nathalie appears to have formed 
some kind of alliance with John 
Ude, her normal impressiveness 
having proved unequal to Alan’s 
muscles. The two intellectuals. The 
two bureaucrats. Tee-hee-hee in the 
mattresses. They don’t want to set 
me free, but that is foolish, as I tell 
them at great length, and I cry a lot 
harder, and even rock back and 
forth, which is nine parts fury, until 
Cassie says, “Oh stop it, hon. I’ll 
fix your jacket. What were you go- 
ing to do with those things, any- 
way? Kill yourself by an over- 
dose?” 



37 




“No,” said I. “I just feel 
humiliated.” She put her arm 
around me, which is enough to 
make you feel an awful bemmon. 
She then promised to fix my jacket. 

I gave them back the screwdriver. 

Oh, it went like a charm! 

John Ude, still uncontrollably 
curious, says to me on the last trek 
back to the old place: “Really, I 
cannot understand why you want to 
die.” 

‘‘Neither can I,” I said. 

‘‘Well, then?” 

I said, ‘‘John Donne, John - John 

with - your - britches - on, John - 
Whittington - turn - again - lord - 
mayor - of - London - Town, we 
are dead. We died the minute we 
crashed. Plague, toxic food, defi- 
ciency diseases, broken bones, in- 
fection, gangrene, cold heat, and 
just plain starvation. I’m just a 
Trembler. My God, you’re the ones 
who want to suffer: conquer and 
control, conquer and control, when 
you haven’t even got stone spears. 
You’re dead.” 

‘‘For dead people, we’re acting 
pretty brisk,” says Ude, with The 
Smile. Haven’t seen that for a 
while; Nathalie must’ve bucked him 
up quite a bit. 

“It’s one of the symptoms,” I 
said. “Galvanism. Corpse jerking. 
Planning, Power. Inheritance. You 
know, survival. My genes shall 
conquer the world. That’s death.” 

“Hear you were quite big in that 
power and planning stuff about fif- 
teen years back,” he says. 

“Then you heard wrong. I 
walked out one day and gave it all 
up. Hideously ineffectual.” 

“Still—” 

“For everything there is a time 
38 



and a season under Heaven; now 
you ought to know that.” 

He keeps on smiling The Smile. 
No recognition. 

I said, “You’re not an historian 
of ideas.” 

“Clever,” says he. “I wondered 
when you’d tumble to it. I was 
what you’d call a bureaucrat. That’s 
why Nathalie and I get along. She 
says we think alike.” 

“Sure, after yesterday,” said I. 
Ude halted. 

“Don’t push us,” he said. 
“Don’t you push us too much 
now.” 

“Then leave me alone,” I said. 
“Just leave me alone and I’ll have 
no reason to push anybody, huh?” 

But they won’t be able to leave 
me alone. I know. Not because of 
the child-bearing, because of the 
disagreement. The disagreement is 
what matters. 

How far will I push them? To 
where? All the way? 

* * * 

Day seven: as lunatics or lem- 
mings will, we dragged our glass- 
and-plastic bungalow, the only 
dwelling with a heater this side of 
God-knows-what, two kilometers to 
the stream, the travois being its own 
light-but-stubborn bottom. It took 
all day. Too tired to do anything 
else. Lying on the mattress out- 
doors, Nathalie sketching in the dirt 
the plans of sanitary latrines 
(downstream). Quickly goes in and 
washes and disinfects her hands. No 
one has yet deliberately ingested 
one morsel of anything- in this 
place; still we must have been breath- 
ing in and swallowing a good deal 

GALAXY 




and no one’s dead yet. We live on 
the freeze-dried. How to test it out? 
A fruitless (sorry) question. 

They asked me to sing. My 
memory was stuck on Dowland; I 
thought of “Flow, My Tears,” “In 
Darkness Let Me Dwell,” “A 
Heart That’s Broken” — well! This 
is not good public relations. “Come 
All Ye Sons of Art”? Nothing with 
polyphony. Finally I sang “Sweet 
Kate” with all the tee-hee-hee. 
Taught Cassie, who has a good 
natural voice, to come in on it, and 
added a few nasty Renaissance 
songs about jealousy (dreadful 
people), “Farewell, Unkind,” and 
finished with a sudden burst of re- 
membrance, swooping in great fake 
arcs, those posh-velveteen melodies: 
Blue desert 
And you and I. 

(Where on earth did I learn “The 
Desert Song”?) 

Lori sang Gilbert and Sullivan 
and forgot the middles. 

“Oh, you can sing!” cried Alan, 
in a burst of admiration (at me, not 
at Lori; the mystic maiden can, of 
course, do anything). 

Schubert! Of course. I said, 
“More tomorrow.” But can I do 
the eleven-note jumps upward on an 
o-umlaut? Never. Ah! Sea songs 
and folk songs. 

(Did I learn them in high 
school?) 

Good night, court jester. 

* * * 

Day eight: the great womb rob- 
bery. The day started out well 
enough, with me limping so badly 
(at least I tried to) that I was ex- 
cused work by John Ude, told “Oh, 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



that’s too bad,” by several others, 
and ended up playing cards with 
Lori (I mean the bed-sheet cards). 
For some reason nobody mentions 
she’s never expected to do any 
work, God knows why. She kept 
beating me at Casino, while I rub- 
bed my ankles. 

“Are those orthopedic shoes?” 

I said uh huh. 

She yelled excitedly, “Fve got 
the ten of diamonds!” and took in 
an eight of clubs and a two of 
hearts. (That’s three points.) She 
looked at me sideways, then stuck 
her nose in the air. 

“So you want us to kill our- 
selves!” she said, with contempt. 

I just made a face and threw up 
my hands. 

“You think nobody’ll find us?” 
she added, a little sharper. 

“Oh, I was just tal^ng,” I said. 
She was counting up her winnings 
so far. She said, frowning, “You’re 
a coward!” and put her cards down 
in a neat little pile, with a stone on 
top of it. 

I said uh huh again. 

“The one thing my Mummy and 
Daddy taught me when they got me 
from the creche when I was se- 
ven,” she said, still sharply, “was 
never to give up on anything. And 
never to be a coward.” Five years 
of money, that’s five years of en- 
forced childishness. She started 
shuffling the cards in a very slow 
method invented by herself; put 
them in piles of three each, with a 
pebble on top, then take one off the 
top of each pile, then subtract every 
fourth card and put them on the bot- 
tom. I can’t figure it. Daddy had set 
up a kind of awning with four 
stakes chopped from a tree and one

of the sheets; we were sitting under 
this and watching the others sweat 
at the foundation of the communal 
house, about fifty meters away from 
the water and several meters above 
it on a slight elevation. Nathalie had 
suggested some kind of wooden 
rockers under the house, like the 
type used in Colonial New England; 
good for winds, for shifting ground, 
and floods. I don’t know what they 
think they’re going to insulate it 
with — wood shavings, chopped by 
hand? 

Lori started to deal the cards. 
You have to pick each of them up 
with both hands and hold it taut; 
otherwise it drapes and you can see 
the other side. Managing a handful 
of them isn’t easy. I said: 

“Shall I tell your fortune?’’ 

‘‘Huh?’’ said she. 

“Do you know how to read 
palms?” 

She shook her head. “That’s sil- 
ly.” She stuck out her hand, then 
giggled and drew it back. 

“All right,” she said, after a 
moment. “Go ahead. But I know 
what you’ll say!” 

“Hmm,” I said, “do you now, 
little miss.” That struck her as ex- 
cruciating: Me, the gypsy. She put 
on an expression very like her 
mother’s only far more exaggerated: 
eyes rolled up, comers of the mouth 
pulled dovvn. 

I said, “You have an immensely 
long life-line.” (I cannot tell a life- 
line from a thumb.) “Here,” I said 
at random. “You will die some 
time in your eighty-ninth year. You 
will be well-known. Even famous. 
Extraordinary!” 

“Known to how many?” said 
Lori quickly. 

40 



“Millions,” I said (acting out 
vast surprise). “Your life-line is in- 
terrupted here by. .by relative iso- 
lation for a period of years. .not 
many years, perhaps eight or nine. 
And then there’s a great blossoming 
of renown, almost as great as what 
I see at the end of your life.” 

“Well, obviously we’re going to 
be saved,” she said pedantically. 

“So it would seem. Here” (I 
think I was somewhere in the mid- 
dle of her palm) “is the line which 
indicates either children or good 
work, fruitful work. It branches 
four — five — no, many more times. 
But I don’t know if that means 
children or work.” 

“Work,” she said promptly. 
“I’m a musician.” 

“Oh,” I said. 

“Yes,” (and she nodded) “I’m a 
composer. ’ ’ 

“Are you? Think of that!” 
“Well, I will be,” she said. 
Then she added, “That’s the same 
thing. But I’ll tell you a secret — ” 
(she all but whispered this, leaning 
over the piles of cards) “/ don't like 
commercial music.” 

“Oh,” I said. What hearts did I 
wring when I was a child? Just a 
biological device. Nature keeping us 
old ones in the service of the 
young. 

She said, frowning, “You look 
funny.” 

Then she added, without the 
slightest transition, “I like serial 
music, like the late twentieth- 
century stuff where it goes deedle 
deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle 
deedle deedle for half an hour and 
then it goes doodle, just once, and 
you could die with excitement.” 

“Uh huh,” I said.

“I’ve written one — well, half of 
one — composition.” She stuck out 
her hand. “Go on.” 

I said, “You know, Lori, what I 
think your fortune means is that you 
will not only be famous for music, 
but also for having been rescued 
here. They’ll probably call the place 
after you. They do things like that, 
you know.” 

“Of course,” she said. “And 
everybody gets rescued. As my 
father was trying to tell you.” 

“John Ude was trying to tell me, 
I believe,” I said. 

“Afy f other V’ She stuck out her 
hand. “Go on.” 

“It’s a musician’s hand,” I said 
shamelessly, “that’s true. And the 
rest. .well, I can’t see much out 
of the ordinary except riches, of 
course. .you know that. .1 think 
you will write a book about your 
experiences — here" — (pointing) 
“but of course I can’t tell whether 
that’s a book or music. The wealth 
line increases at that point. And 
marriage — ” 

“I’ll never get married.” 

“Yes, there’s hardly anything. 
Though your love-line is quite 
another thing. But who, of course, 
or even what, I can’t tell.” 

“Artistic passion?” said she. 

“Mm hm. And the rest. .well, 
it doesn’t tell us anything we don’t 
know. Sensitive. Intellectual. But 
animal vitality, mustn’t forget that. 
That’s about it.” 

“Oh,” she said. She was disap- 
pointed. 

“It changes,” I said, “almost 
day to day. Most people don’t know 
that. Small changes, of course, no- 
thing big. But that’s all I can see 
today.” 

We who ARE ABOUT TO 



“You’ll do it again in a week,” 
said Lori decisively, beginning to 
deal her cards. It did not seem to 
occur to her that she was giving me 
orders. I pictured her giving orders 
to Alan-Bobby. 

No. 

She dealt the cards, a very 
finicky young woman, concentrating 
deeply. 

Suddenly she said, “Are you re- 
ally a coward?” 

“No,” I said. 

“Yes you are,” she said. “Pick 
up your cards. If you teach me to 
read palms. I’ll read your palm. 
That’ll tell us.” 

She won the next game, too. 

We were well into our third and 
Lori was singing something from 
Gilbert and Sullivan about not tel- 
ling him, her, or it, because 
etiquette didn’t permit, and not even 
hinting, whispering, or pointing it 
out — yes, very apposite — and I was 
bored — when Alan shouted “Over 
here, everyone!” because he had 
the big voice. They had been slack- 
ing work for some time, with a lot 
of talk between Nathalie, the ex- 
professor, and Victor. (One to dig, 
two to chop, and two to carry either 
logs or dirt in the tool chest: 
Nathalie, Alan, Valeria — with the 
hand hatchet — Victor, Ude.) 

Symptoms of a conference. 

“Bring your tent!” shouted Alan 
conscientiously. 

So we did — rather, I did; Lori 
wouldn’t touch it for fear that she 
might break out in hives. I told her 
while I was uprooting it (and not 
entirely out of compassion; she 
could be a real whiner when she 
chose) that she’d live to be eighty, 
name all the plants in the region.

lose her allergies as she grew up, 
and end up writing the first book 
about Lori’s Planet. 

The court. Under another jury- 
rigged tent. After this my memories 
get a little muddled. Disturbance; 
ripples in a pond. I smiled mechan- 
ically. Won’t be thought a good, re- 
liable witness — 

{By whom?) 

Reliable witness. 

Victor’s very big. Very polite. So 
you can’t get at him, perhaps. Val- 
eria was off to one side, with Cas- 
sie. Victrix patted the ground next 
to her invitingly and Lori stared 
carefully in another direction. Alan, 
awed, with his mouth open; John 
Ude peculiarly cool; and Nathalie 
grimly watching the ground. 

Mister-not-Professor Ude said, “I 
call this meeting to order.” 

Oh. Oh my. Important. 

“You’re chairman?” I said. 
“Well! Who made you chairman?” 
Nathalie: “I did.” 

That is, they both did. Things are 
going to be very interesting. 

Victor: “That’s a valid objection. 
I suggest we begin by selecting a 
chair.” 

Silence. Then Nathalie said wear- 
ily, “I nominate” — Guess Who — 
well, he was nominated, seconded, 
and voted in. Almost unanimously. 

John Ude: “Do you have any 
more objections?” 

Me: “No.” 

(Almost unanimously means me 
and Lori, Lori because she wanted 
her father to be, and 1 abstained.) 

“We have to talk about some- 
thing very important,” said Ude. “I 
mean having children.” 

Hand up, me. He recognized 
me — does this sound as crazy to 

42 



you as it does to me? — and I said, 
“Priorities backwards. First we 
have to poison Loti.” 

“Huh?” she said; “you’re 
crazy.” 

“Mr. Chairman,” I said, “point 
of order. Is it necessary for us to 
pretend that we’ve never met be- 
fore?’ ’ 

He smiled. Oh, the universes 
tremble when John Ude smiles! He 
said, “I suppose we can afford to 
be somewhat more informal. In 
fact, I think it will be a very good 
thing. Please go ahead.” 

I said, “I’m only trying to 
suggest that before we start any 
babies, we’d better start finding out 
what we can eat around here.” 

(Lori, sotto voce, with a dig in 
the ribs, “Why’d you say 
poison?”) 

Cassie said, “Sure, why her?” 

“I was joking,” I said. “I meant 
she’s allergic to so many things. 
She should be the last person to eat 
anything.” 

Nathalie: “Will you volunteer to 
be the first?” 

“No,” I said. “Will you?” 
Nathalie got up, very angry. 
“We have food and water for five 
months and three weeks! Perhaps 
you’d like the rest of us to eat grass 
and leave it all to you?’ ’ 

“I waive it,” I said. “I leave it 
alone. Give me the broomstick and 
I’ll go up to the head of the stream 
and drink the water without the 
purifier. If I start hurting. I’ll kill 
myself. ’ ’ 

“This is no time for joking.” 
(John Ude) 

I said, “I’m not joking. It’s a 
genuine offer.” 

Silence. 



GALAXY 




“About the children,” said Ude. 
“Mister Graham, as the oldest of 
us, has offered to donate his genetic 
material first.” 

Cassie giggled. 

Nathalie glared at her. But 
Nathalie also sat down. 

(Was Victor on a special diet, on 
the ship?) 

I got up and ambled towards the 
stream. By all that’s alive, a melod- 
ramatic “Stop!” and then “Stop 
her!” from John Ude, and here was 
Alan-Bobby running ahead of me, 
like some crazy postman with a 
Special Delivery (excuse me) and 
turning sheepishly to stand in front, 
his arms stretched out. 

“All right,” I said, “all right, I 
can go taste the river when you’re 
asleep, can’t I?” and I headed back 
towards the improvised council tent, 
feeling in my palm the pellet-gun. 
Reflex. Not here, not now. Back in 
the sleeve of the jacket you go. 

Mow’d it get there? 

Oh, / forgot to tell you. 

Between yesterday and today, 
when everyone was asleep, I went 
back to the old site and dug every- 
thing up. Including my phar- 
macopoeia. Left them lying on the 
ground with dreams of The Desert 
Song ringing in their ears. (I had 
mist-spray hypnotics in my under- 
wear. I’m not that quiet.) I tiptoed 
off, anyway, feeling Alan-Bobby as 
he sat up, probably talking in his 
sleep, with a swift squish to the 
nostrils and very daring, went off 
on the trudge to the old camp, 
where it took me forever to pry up 
that rock. I left in the dusk; I re- 
turned at the end of the dark; the 
sky ragged where the sun rises and 
sets, one patch of cloud red, red as 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



blood, red as fury. I gave them 
each a last spray as I came, too. 
Except Lori. (She might be aller- 
gic.) She was wiggling and mutter- 
ing uncomfortably to herself. 
Watched her face slowly settle itself 
and become clarified as the light 
grew and grew. Without getting 
anywhere — I mean the light — for 
hours and hours more. 

“Hey, you better go back,” says 
Alan. 

“Oh.” I sigh. “Okay.” And go 
back, helpless. 

Now I’m going to be first. I said, 
“Well, you’ll have to wait until I’m 
off the pills. And then it sometimes 
takes a few months to restore fertili- 
ty. And we don’t want septuplets, 
so that’s another couple of 
months.” 

“You’re not taking any pills,” 
said Nathalie. 

“Because you’ve never seen me 
do it? Whew!” said I. (That last’s a 
whistle.) 

“What are you taking?” said 
Ude. 

I made up a name. 

“Then you don’t,” (he said, 
blinking slightly but looking stead- 
ily at me the while) “have to worry 
about multiple births. There haven’t 
been any on that since ’07. I don’t 
see why you and Victor can’t start 
now, if you like.” 

Victor said politely that he cer- 
tainly wouldn’t mind as long as I 
wouldn’t mind. 

I said I would mind. 

“Why?” said Nathalie. 

“Personal preference,” said I. 

“It’s her religion!” said Cassie, a 
little indignantly. “You should re- 
spect a person’s religion, you 
know.” 



43 




“She’s probably left-handed." 
This is Mrs. Graham spitefully. 
Cassie obviously wasn’t sure what 
“left-handed’’ meant; she leaned 
towards Mrs. Graham, who whis- 
pered to her. 

Cassie colored to the roots of her 
hair — and her neckline (a sheet). 

“In a month, if you don’t 
mind,’’ I said to Victor, with a sort 
of little bow. “When it’ll do most 
good.’’ Now he can’t have liked 
that. But he looked unmoved and 
nodded his head. Polite. Calm. 
Great handsome, hollow monument 
of a man. Perhaps he’s run out of 
something. Perhaps he’s going to be 
ill. Hypertensive or cardiac, I can 
almost smell it. Or some other fatal- 
ity hanging in the air and nobody 
wants to talk about it in front of the 
daughter. Get him before he dies. 

“Before that month, then,’’ said 
John Ude, grinning in my direction, 
“Nathalie has suggested herself, 
and afterwards the other lady, Cas- 
sie. The — uh — persons involved can 
certainly find privacy almost any- 
where, I suppose. Anyway, it’s 
none of our business.” 

Cassie, who was folding the hem 
of her improvised dress under and 
over with her fingers, again and 
again, said: 

“I’m going to be called by my 
full name. I don’t like Cassie. 
That’s only a professional name.” 

“Of course,” said John Ude. 

“Tell us,” said Victor. 

Alan looked blankly receptive. 

“My name is Cassandra,” said 
Cassie. 

Nobody caught it. Lori said, 
“That’s a nice name,” (possibly to 
annoy her mother). I inhaled when I 
should’ve swallowed and for thirty 

44 



seconds there until I stopped cough- 
ing John Ude was very tender and 
careful with his walking womb. 

“Cassandra’s always wanted 
children,” he said pleasantly to me 
when I could breathe again. 
Nathalie was behind him, looking 
over his shoulder. 

I tried to call him a son-of-a- 
prick and only croaked. 

“YeS?” he said, very alert — but 
he always seems alert; it’s part of 
the window-dressing. 

“Listen,” I whispered, just man- 
aging to speak. “I’ll go away. Take 
the broomstick and send it back, 
very slow, so you can catch it. Go 
upstream — downstream — doesn’t 
matter — try the water. Take no 
food. Just leave me.” 

“No!” said Nathalie. 

“Why?” I coughed some more. 

“If I’ve got to do it, you’ve got 
to do it,” said Nathalie. 

“You. .don’t have to.” And I 
cleared my throat. At last. 

“We’d better keep an eye on 
her,” said Nathalie to John Ude. 

I think 1 put my head in my 
hands. Suppose they found my gun? 
My things? Wait long enough and it 
won’t matter. Although I can al- 
ways do it. Anyone can do it. Easy 
enough to kill if it doesn’t matter 
about being found out. Then 
perhaps they’d kill me, and it would 
be over, and that’s all right. 

But I’m afraid of waiting too 
long. Eroding. Purpose all gone. 
Slipping into no-decision, no- 
purpose; hard enough as it is. God 
knows. I think everyone loves it 
here because their choices are all 
made for them; we were never very 
comfortable with our fate in our 
own hands, were we? Better to act

on the modern religion: an incarna- 
tion of the immortal germ-plasm. 
Nostalgia for the mud. Simplicities. 

I said, “Cassandra!” and burst 
out laughing, coughing again. 

“You’re going mad,” said 
Nathalie, with a certain satisfaction 
and she and John Ude stepped 
backwards so they could talk, I 
suppose, about keeping an eye on 
me. 

And nobody knows. Nobody 
knows anything about anything. 

“Aren’t you going to play cards 
with me?” said Lori, suddenly turn- 
ing up with the cards in a sort of 
bag she’d made out of a scarf of her 
mother’s. It was bright, bright blue. 
Royal blue. 

“Sure,” I said. “Why not?” 
And did. 

■k * * 

Day nine. I took my turn digging 
and carrying. I was watched, al- 
ways by someone. Nathalie and 
Victor disappeared dutifully over 
the hill while the rest of us snored 
(presumably). 

★ * * 

Day ten. Watched. They overes- 
timate their perseverance. At 
bedtime — the sun still circling round 
the same eternal altitude — Nathalie 
talked angrily about tying me to 
something for the night so’s I 
wouldn’t disappear. I told her not to 
be a fool; anything she could tie, I 
could untie. 

People were embarrassed. 

* * * 

Day eleven. Idiot labor. A Long 

We who are about to 



House none of us will ever live to 
enjoy. The food goes faster this 
way. A midday siesta under the 
tent, all of us huddled together in 
the shadow. But it merely gets hotter 
and hotter until sunset. 

The sun is not changing its posi- 
tion, not fast enough to be timed, 
anyway. The weather stays the 
same. No rain, but the stream keeps 
up. By some eerie common consent 
Valeria has become the cook — good 
for nothing else, I suppose. That is, 
she prepares the packets of ffeeze- 
dried, and pours stream water into 
the purifier. No one dead yet. 

The idyllic desert island. Odd 
how that started out “deserted” and 
ended up “desert”. Hence the con- 
vention^ sand and palm trees. No, 
“desert” once meant only wild. 

That it is. 

* ★ * 

Day twelve. Victor’s ill. He sat 
all day under the tent, dozing and 
taking some sort of pills. Angina, 
I’ll be bound. 

More hauling, more digging on 
that idiot building. 

Early evening (when the sun 
stands at four o’clock above a par- 
ticular hill; we are in a little valley 
with a close horizon): Flop. Flop. 
Flop. Flop. Valeria and Victor have 
already flopped. Discarded pill- 
bottle on the ground. Lori’s being 
kept away, mostly by Alan, some- 
times by Nathalie, who says that 
she ought to work for a change. 

(Lori stuck out her tongue. I gig- 
gled.) 

Victor looked unconcerned at this 
invasion of his privacy: or not con- 
cerned, rather. 



45 




Lori said carelessly, “Oh, Dad’s 
had this before.” Valeria is paying 
no attention to him or to any of us; 
she’s asleep. I have begun to be 
startled at anyone’s coming up be- 
hind me, with a kind of shrinking at 
the presence of the rest of them, but 
Victor Graham is magnificently 
vacant; doesn’t care that there are 
people around him. 

We slept — we’ve gotten into the 
habit,' it seems, of sleeping in 
stages: part in the middle of the 
“afternoon,” then a siege before 
the dark, then a kind of premature 
wakefulness for a few hours until 
the twilight begins and depresses 
everybody. I seem to go to sleep 
faster than anyone, but I always 
wake a little earlier. Nervousness. I 
had my head by his knee. 

Shocked awake. 

Yawning. It wasn’t anything, I 
thought. 

Listening wakefuUy. Eyes open. 

It’s a little gasp from Victor 
Graham. He got up, holding (I 
think) his left arm with his right, 
for I saw him pass over me, and 
from that position on the ground, 
with my face down, it was like feel- 
ing a cloud go over you at an 
enormous height; I said he walked 
between us and over us, between 
two hills. Equator- wards. 

He stopped to retch. 

All I have to do is lie here and 
pretend to sleep. 

He’s walking off between the 
hills. Going to die alone, I suppose. 

I got up carefully and picked my 
way to John Ude, put one hand 
over his mouth, and with the other, 
pinched him. 

“Ssssh!” I jerked my head at 
Victor. You must say for the not- 

46 



Professor that he takes things in 
quickly. We knew that neither of us 
must wake Lori and that she’s the 
lightest sleeper of all because she 
hasn’t worked. 

“Where’d you put my stuff?” I 
whispered, off at the edge of the 
group. 

His wits are wandering. He had 
to go back and wake Nathalie. And 
all the time, you know, it was burn- 
ing a hole in my pocket, I mean my 
belt pop-out, the stuff he should be 
using; I was extraordinarily con- 
scious of it sitting over my left 
hip-bone. 

He came back with Nathalie and 
we ran. Victor had sat down under 
one of the stumpy trees and was 
staring ahead of him. Nathalie, fin- 
gers shaking, spread out on the dirt 
die stuff they had confiscated from 
me and looked helplessly at Ude, 
who was beginning to frame a ques- 
tion, but I had it out and the string 
around his arm, the stuff into the 
vein. These are collapsible, perma- 
nent syringes, foldups like accor- 
dion pleating'. 

Nathalie said, “Antisepsis — ” 

I said, “Lie down, you fool,” to 
Victor, and he did. A little less 
livid, as the stuff got to him. 

I said, “It’s a stimulant. Can you 
swallow?” 

“No,” he said, still concentrating 
on the pain. 

“You can,” I said, selecting 
from the pile, “bite on this and 
breathe. It’s a mind-bender; won’t 
stop the pain, but it’ll separate you 
from it. Takes the nastiness out of 
it.” 

He did. Nathalie bent over, but I 
shooed her away. “Do you want 
Lori?” I said. 



GALAXY 




“No.” 

“Your wife?” 

“Won’t come.” He whispered, 
very carefully. The cyanotic grey 
was ebbing. I said: 

“The stimulant is only tempor- 
ary. I can give you more until we 
either run out of it or it wears you 
out, but I can’t heal you. You may 
heal yourself if you lie very still.” 

He said, “Tell Lori — ” 

“What?” said Nathalie anxious- 
ly- 

“Anything. Make it up. 

I said, “Mister Graham has other 
things to do right now. We will tell 
Lori and Valeria that he thought of 
them, that his last words were of 
them, and that he loved them.” 

The dying man laughed. 
“Not — wife.” 

“But I can tell Lori, can’t I?” I 
said. 

He nodded, just a bit. 

“Victor loves his daughter and 
gives the planet to her. He’s proud 
of her and knows she’ll do well. 
Okay?” 

“Yes!” His color was stealing 
back, almost magical, but it puts a 
worse burden on the great arteries 
crowning the heart. I said, “I think 
you’d better go back and deal with 
the scene there. Both of you. When 
they wake up, you know; you can 
tell them whatever you like.” 

“I?” said Nathalie. “I’m sup- 
posed to be with him!” Victor’s 
gaze was still so Hxed that to get 
his attention you had to be right in 
front of him; Nathalie put herself in 
front of me, directly in his line of 
vision; she had the anxiety lines of 
the brows furrowed together, in that 
very expressive field of musculature 
above and around the human eyes. 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



Tl^e eyes themselves, you know, 
show almost nothing. 

John Ude said, “Perhaps I should 
stay — ’ ’ 

I said, “Are you afraid of Lori?” 
and then to Victor, “Who do you 
want to stay with you? Which of 
us?” 

“You,” he said. 

“Of course. She knows the 
drugs,” said John Ude with The 
Smile. 

“You’re not afraid,” he said, “of

me. 

Silence. 

“Leave that and that and that,” I 
said, pointing. “Now get cracking! 
You’ve work to do.” 

“None of these is marked,” said 
Ude, finally, gathering up half my 
things. (He thought he had it all.) 

“I know,” I said. “I also sell 
knowledge.” John Ude patted me 
on the shoulder: loathesome, 

loathesome! — said into my ear, 
“Good of you.” 

Victor said, with a smile, “Are 
you sorry? You know. .” 

“I think I am,” I said. And al- 
most was. Sorry for him, I mean. 
One thing dying people usually 
know, if they have any sense left, is 
what they want; and that is so rare 
in the human condition that it com- 
mands a certain kind of respect. Al- 
though I suppose they may know 
what they want only because there’s 
so little left to choose from that the 
task’s easy. It strips people down. 
And what I feel — or felt — about 
him, I don’t know. An intense 
curiosity. Where he was going, 
where he came from, who he was. 
It’s a world going out — though 
there are some worlds I know too 
well to care about, like Ude.

“I was poor,” he said. “Didja 
know that?” I shook my head. 
Something of the old timbre back in 
his voice, still half a whisper. I 
could never find pulses in the wrist, 
so I put my fingertips on the great 
vein in his neck. He smiled. “Feels 
nice,” he said. Then: “I worked on 
myself. Made myself good-looking, 
you know: clothes, accent, the 
works. Spent a lot on surgery; no 
whore could’ve done better.” 

He grasped my hand, then let his 
arm fall but still kept holding on to 
my hand, I think out of fear, though 
he wasn’t feeling any pain; couldn’t 
have talked that easily if he had. 

He said, “I can satisfy anyone.” 
“Did you practice?” 

He nodded. “Of course.” What a 
way to spend a life. Here is the 
kernel of Victor Graham: I can 
satisfy anyone. Myself, I eat 
potatoes. Well? He must’ve read 
something in my face because he 
imprisoned my fingers more severe- 
ly; thank God I don’t wear rings. 
He said, “Do you despise me?” 

“In comparison with my friends?” 
I said and couldn’t help it; I 
began to laugh. This pleased him. 

Then I said, “I only wish it had 
been more fun for you.” 

“It was all right.” The cyanotic 
tinge was coming back but he didn’t 
seem to feel it. “Wasn’t so easy the 
first few years, but when I met Val 
I knew I had it made. Worked like 
hell to get her, too.” 

“You took her name?” 

“No. She’s old fashioned. I used 
to — was able to — order her around 
sometimes, then. .think we flipped 
a coin. .you know, I loved her but 
I can’t remember now.” 

“And Lori?” I said. 



“A beautiful child. Still a child. 
You’ll look after her?” 

“Of course.” 

“This is all for her,” he said, 
with a stirring of the arm as if he 
would sweep it round him to indi- 
cate the horizon. 

“She’ll grow up better here,” I 
said. 

“Sure,” he said without irony, 
“and her mother’ll do some work. 
It’ll do her good. Val’ll live long.” 
He sighed. He said, “You should 
take some of this. It’s religious. I 
feel like a Christian.” 

“Instant religion? There’s some- 
thing like that in the trade name: 
Forgiveness without tears. Some- 
thing. But I don’t feel like forgiving 
anyone, you see. I’m nasty.” 

What I didn’t say: how dull it can 
become after a while, these exalta- 
tions that leave nothing behind 
them. The headiness of anger. 
Perhaps I’m an addict. An anger 
addict. I said, “Victor, the 
analgesic will last for hours, but the 
stimulant’s wearing off. I can give 
you more” — holding it up — “or 
you can fight it out alone, or there’s 
this” — putting the glass ampoule by 
his free hand where his hand lay on 
the ground, that eternal mid- 
afternoon sun palely lighting it, the 
time just before the light becomes 
ruddy. In a few hours we would 
have our twilight. 

“What’s that?” he said. “The ul- 
timate analgesic?” 

I think that surprised me more 
than his use of “Christian.” I said, 
“You clever man!” 

He said, “If you hold my hand.” 
“Can’t,” I said. “It’s a contact 
poison, worked through the skin. 
You break the ampoule. If I held

your hand I would run a considera- 
ble risk of being ultimately anes- 
thetized myself.” 

‘‘Death’s your friend,” he said. 

I shook my head. “Never!” 
“Don’t want it,” he said, trying 
to nick away the ampoule with his 
finger, so I rescued it — very 
carefully — and laid it to one side. 
Must remember where it is, too. 
Better still, pick it up and put it 
away in my belt. Which I did. 

He said, “I haven’t been much 
good to Val these last months.” He 
was still looking straight ahead of 
him. He said, “I want to see the 
sun,” so I turned him about with 
great care, Pole- wards — the sun was 
declining into what we had agreed 
to call the North, interrupted by a 
stumpy tree on the side of a hill. I 
moved him until he could see it, 
propping his head in my lap — he 
was a heavy man — I think leaving 
the poison with him would have 
been useless unless I’d put it in his 
hand; he was too feeble, for all his 
talking. 

He said, “I’m going to die.” 

He was not that cyanotic. Perhaps 
the light concealed it, turning him 
rosy. This damned place has been 
looking stranger and stranger each 
morning, despite my trying not to 
see it that way — imagination? Like 
meeting a childhood friend; at first 
the resemblance is as clear as can 
be, and then after a quarter of an 
hour, you begin to wonder. I sup- 
pose you see all the other things 
time has laid down on the face. 

He said, “Go away.” 

I didn’t move. He was breathing 
with difficulty. I could hear his 
breath stop, catch, go on, then stop 
again, like an electric motor with a

bad connection — too apt a

on, stop — 

I think I was hypnotized by the 
tree’s shadow as it crawled towards 
us, or the shifting motes of sun in it 
between the leaves, the sun having 
sunk behind the tree and each spot 
of light a camera obscura of the 
sun: round as a coin and twinkling. 

He was trying very hard to 
breathe. No oxygen going to that 
brain. Then he stopped. Easy as 
pie. I knew Victor was still there, 
shut up inside himself, but the hous- 
ing was shot. No good any more. He 
couldn’t feel anything anyone could 
do to it. An eerie feeling, that 
heavy, motionless head in my lap; 
you never know how mobile people 
are (in sleep, in hypnosis, in the 
deepest, drugged state) until you 
feel them dead. “Dead weight’’ is 
the real thing. I know. 

Two minutes. 

Five. 

Gone. The last traces died out. 
Only the coral shell now; the thing 
making it had gone somewhere else. 
Or anyway, wasn’t here. I let his 
head down on to the ground — he 
was staring straight up — and 
stretched, spinning about dizzily as 
if for all the world I could catch 
him as he flew off. Catch a sight of 
him. There’s some complicated, 
biochemical reason for the loss of 
weight at death — though it feels the 
opposite — but if Victor in the shape 
of a butterfly was zipping off to bet- 
ter realms, I never saw him. 

The sun still hung there, behind 
the tree. It won’t set for an hour.

Nathalie were not perhaps the Spirit 
of Death around here: I mean hard 
work, looking to the future, plan- 
ning about things, that sort of stuff. 
She said: 

“You fool.” 

Then she said, “Do you think I 
WANT to be here!” 

“Don’t — I — ’’ I said, leaning 
backward. If your legs are crossed, 
you can’t get up unless you lean 
forward, so I was effectively tied in 
a knot; if I’d got up, it would’ve 
been right into Nathalie’s face. 

She said, “Oh God, you make 
me sick!” 

I could roll sideways and get up. 

“You,” she said, but her voice 
had changed and her pupils were no 
longer all her eyes, so I knew she 
was only going to talk and I could 
afford to stay there, to stay helpless; 
she said, “Oh, what do you know 
about it!” 

I said, “I’m sorry.” I looked 
meek. (And I was sorry, only none 
of them will take the cure, not one.) 

She sank to her knees, but still 
leaning over me, which is some- 
thing they teach them in govern- 
ment school, maybe; she said, “Do 
you know where I was going before 
I came here?” 

I shook my head. 

She sat down, sort of collapsed 
sideways. She said, “Well, I wasn’t 
going to dig latrines. Or bear 
babies. Or plant crops.” 

(There are no crops.) 

“I was going,” she said, “to 
school. And not to learn how to lec- 
ture on music, little woman! Some- 
thing quite different.” 

“Yes,” I said. 

“Do you? You can’t. None of 
you can, not even Ude; he’s a 

52 



paper-pusher. I wasn’t; I would’ve 
learned how to kill him with my 
bare hands, I would have learned to 
make explosives — yes, even here! I 
would’ve learned how to find the 
right stuff and make them — and 
when I was finished there wasn’t 
one of you who would have dared 
to come within twenty meters of 
me, let me tell you — and Alan 
would be dead.” 

She pulled angrily at the grass 
before her, which may poison us. 

“I’d love to see that other-fucker 
with a broken neck,” she said. 

I laughed — suddenly couldn’t 
help it. She sprang to her feet. 
“Two minds with but a single 
thought,” I said. She sat down; 
very slowly, but she sat down. 
Loosened a little. 

Nathalie smiled. 

“If only we had some — ” said I. 

“Plaster,” she added, “and wax, 
we could — ” 

“Make a cast — ” 

“Of his— ” 

She laughed; in fact she roared, 
throwing her head back. Then she 
said: 

“And a sperm bank.” Very 
sober. 

“There is that,” I admitted. 

A short silence. 

“How was Victor?” I said. 

“What?” said she. “D’you 
mean, was he fertile?” (They had 
looked at it from different view- 
points, apparently.) 

She added sharply, “How is he? 
He’s dead!” 

I stared at the ground. Earth, 
grass, pebbles: could’ve been any- 
where. 

Nathalie got up. “You see, one 
goes on,” she said. “Unless of 

GALAXY 




course one’s afraid, like you. One 
learns that.” 

“Afraid?” I said. 

“Yes.” She strode to the pit, 
reached over the edge for the 
shovel, then straightened up and 
bent the thing until the handle 
clicked back together. With her left 
hand she pushed her hair behind her 
ears. “You’re demoralized, like all 
civilians,” she said. “You miss 
your luxuries.” 

She shoveled a spadeful of earth 
out on to the bank, tucked her hair 
behind her ears again (it always 
came loose and swung in her face), 
and leaned on the shovel; bitter, se- 
vere, very pleased with herself. She 
said: 

“My parents were poorer than 
Cassie’s. Did you know that? Of 
course not. But that’s why you all 
need me, because I know how to 
fight. I didn’t grow up in private, 
like that damn-fool little girl and I 
didn’t grow up rich. I was in a 
youth group and I learned how to 
fight. You’re bloody lucky you’ve 
got me.” 

I said, “You won a lot of scho- 
larships, didn’t you?” but she 
didn’t like my guessing it and went 
back to digging, with her face set as 
if every bash at the dirt were at 
Alan-Bobby’s backbone. 

I said, “Survival — ” and she 
said, “Survival’s the name of the 
game. You’d better move; I’m 
switching to this side.” So I did. 

But for what? The sound of the 
digging stopped; Nathalie had 
straightened up and was looking at 
me again, the death’s head. 

I had spoken out loud. 

I said, “All right, all right, 1 
didn’t say it!” and scrambled to my 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



feet. This is crazy comedy; one 
must, after all, do it sooner or later, 
and the madwoman in black is go- 
ing to hit me with her shovel or 
fling it at my head because I want 
to get right in my soul before I die. 

She said, “You walking cunt, I 
would like to kill you too.” 

Her face is blanched to the color 
of paper; her eyes are black and 
white; all pupil. She’s quite mad. If 
I shoot her, the others will come 
running. I said, “I’ll dig,” and she 
threw me the shovel, which did in- 
deed almost hit me. I rapped the 
hinge to make sure it wouldn’t fold 
up. Nathalie strode away over the 
ffeshly-tumed dirt, head high, blaz- 
ing, broadcasting hatred. “It suits 
you!” she cried, meaning (I sup- 
pose) that grave-digging was my 
proper occupation. (It used to be 
taboo, like executioners.) I dug at 
the channel — a little sloppily, for I 
haven’t half her purpose — and you 
don’t develop strength by being told 
off to play cards with Lori. TTiey 
had, at least, the sense to put the 
latrine downstream, though the odd 
thing about this hole is that nobody 
is ever going to use it. 

Did you know that hangmen were 
once taboo? 

What do you know? 

Do you know anything?

(I should go back and erase all 
that silence; the vocoder makes a 
mark whenever I stop, like a punc- 
tuation mark but different; then it 
begins a new line. There must be 
too many of them. No, hell, let 
them stay.) What happened later: we 
had our siesta; we dug some more; 
Lori asked me to sing and I did, the 
sun hanging in the sky, dropping no 
lower, remaining motionless over 
the same inky, fiery, spotted bush. 
Silhouettes. The same long shadows 
from dawn to dusk. I sant “Chu 
Chu Chu;” I sang ‘‘Love Is Splen- 
did, Isn’t it!” I sang ‘‘What A Per- 
fect Day This Has Been.” Ude had 
a long conversation with Alan, who 
is becoming more and more au- 
thoritative and more and more 
pleased with himself. They spoke in 
low voices; I couldn’t hear what 
they said. Making plans? 

(We lay down to sleep.)

♦ ♦ ♦ 

Day twenty. Eighteen. Nineteen? 
I can’t remember. Too much going 
on. Managing people is a melan- 
choly skill; it depends mostly on 
keeping your mouth shut. 

The night after we’d buried Vic- 
tor Graham I took off with the 
broom and the face-mask, making 
up a package of food, soap, a mat- 

54 



tress, bits of plastic towelling, spare 
underwear, things like that, all tied 
up in a sheet with one set of comers 
tied above the other. 

I went upstream. I got up in the 
middle of the night and used up the 
last of my sleepydust, spraying 
them as if I’d been putting Grow on 
plants, tomato beds perhaps, step- 
ping carefully between them as you 
would between your eggplants or 
your canteloupe vines, then taking 
the broomstick low above the water, 
for the ground-effect leaves a trail: 
some crushed things don’t rise and 
over bare earth there’s a characteris- 
tic sort of smudge: loose stuff 
blown to both sides like a giant 
broom. So they might find me. 

I went up two hundred and forty 
kilometers, until I hurt all over, un- 
til the river cut between sharper and 
sharper hills like glacial debris and 
glacial scar: an old garbage-heap 
that glaciers push in front of them 
and leave behind when they retreat. 
Until the river went down between 
two hills and vanished, down into 
the ground. 

I found a cave. The drop to the 
water: twenty meters, the other 
bank almost flat. A streamlet three 
fingers across rising in the loose 
rock-rubble in the back and making 
straight for the edge, with the 
necessary number of curlicues to 
avoid stones and hillocks. Beyond, 
a steep hill, covered with thorny 
tangle, something new, like 
blackberry vines, and the cave not 
really a cave but an accidental 
hole-in-a-heap with boulders 
wedged together and stuff grown 
over the top. But very big, very 
solid boulders. The streamlet- 
bottom is pebbles, fine gravel. I put 

GALAXY 




everything down and poked assidu- 
ously in the rubbish in back with 
the broomstick handle and even lit a 
fire with some of the litter I found 
outside, thrusting burning stuff into 
the back of the cave in several 
places. 

Nothing. No alarums and excur- 
sions, no nasty little dwellers with 
pincers, no alarmed rustlings, no 
sound, no motion. 

So there’s only people. 

I’m about one-point-fifty meters 
tall; the cave is about one-point- 
sixty-five and I like that. Tall 
people can’t stand upright here. I 
propped the broomstick against the 
drift of friable rock and harder peb- 
bles at the back, put down my 
hobo’s bundle, unrolled the mat- 
tress, and laid my things out. The 
extra underwear I’d put in the metal 
box I once used to store my music 
tapes; this is where the vocoder 
print-out will go (when I make a 
print-out). I guess we will bury it. 
There was room for my mattress at 
the edge, to one side of the little, 
bisecting stream: bed, running wa- 
ter, and I can hear in the directions 
I can’t see. The streamlet makes 
almost no noise: too tiny. Wonder- 
ful for sanitation. And it didn’t kill 
me. I had gone 240 kilometers, 
perhaps one hundred sixty as the 
crow flies (none here), and that’s 
six or seven days’ walking for ex- 
ceedingly determined people. 

And that is why I carried nine 
days’ food. 

*• * * 

But I lost track. I thought they’d 
gone away. I went out scouting 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO 



with the broomstick and saw no 
one, not from the tops of the high- 
est hills. I couldn’t go too far or I’d 
lose my way back — until I thought 
of spreading some underwear under 
two rocks; you can see the white 
very far. 

There was nobody coming, no 
black specks, no swaying in the 
bushes, not even three-quarters of 
the way down the river. It was al- 
together beautiful. But I couldn’t go 
any closer. Wouldn’t. Didn’t want 
to. Didn’t dare. 

So I lost track. 



* * * 

They came in the afternoon. Put- 
ting one’s head down close to the 
stream, you can just barely hear it 
talking, but I think I screened out 
everything else with the river be- 
cause I never heard them. I woke 
from a dream of talking very ration- 
ally to Cassie somewhere utterly in- 
distinct and uncharacterized (so that 
if might have been equally ‘easily 
back on the ship or in the middle of 
the Grand Canyon) and there she 
was, standing in silhouette in the 
door of the cave; I was mucking 
about in the floating layers between 
light sleep and lighter sleep when 
you become aware of your body 
and don’t want to, like anesthetic: 
places in the mattress that weren’t 
as thick as they should be. Stretch- 
ing. Stiff back. 

I said, “Why have you come for 
the water thingie? I left it.’’ 

I woke up. 

Why didn’t they come in? Be- 
cause they couldn’t see in, proba- 
bly. I had thought Cassie was al- 

55 




ready inside, but as my vision came 
back I realized I’d only been asleep; 
everything’s flat for a moment after 
you wake up. 

I said, conversationally, “How’d 
you find me?” 

She said, ”1 want to talk to you. 
Can I come in?” Brave 
Cassandra! — whose shaky voice in- 
dicated something else was going 
on. Probably Alan-Bobby exploring 
the hillside. There are heavy 
scramblings overhead, something 
rather large and stupid moving 
about on the cave roof. Either he’s 
proving himself for Lori or (more 
likely) they decided he was It. 

I propped the mattress (which is 
very thin and light) against the 
rock-rubble at the back of the cave; 
don’t want to trip on it. 

I said, “Good Lord, you didn’t 
bring Lori, did you?” 

“No, she’s with Val.” So it’s 
Val now. I said, “I don’t know 
what you’re doing here and I don’t 
know what you want of me. Go 
away.” 

She said, “Can’t you come out 
for a minute?’ ’ 

I let a moment go by. ‘‘All 
right,” I said. I suppose one of us 
has to act in good faith that the 
other is in good faith, slender as 
such a chance may be. Let’s test it. 
I put on my jacket, picked up a 
couple of rocks about the size of 
my hand. Circled close to the cave 
wall, on the side Cass was on so 
she couldn’t see me, watching my 
feet carefully, and made it almost to 
the entrance without making too 
much noise. Which I hoped 
sounded like echoes, anyhow. Still 
in shadow. I threw one of the rocks 
across the cave and it made a very 

56 



satisfactory, verisimilar sort of 
sound, falling in the loose shale 
over there, and there was a truly 
tremendous scramble from above, 
as Alan-Bobby the Megatherium 
dropped from the cave roof and 
rushed inside. 

And bashed his head against the 
ceiling. He does not realize, I think, 
just how expendable the others con- 
sider him to be. On his hands and 
knees, shaking his head from side 
to side. Then he fell into the 
streamlet. He couldn’t see very 
well, of course. And the others 
might not have told him to do this; 
he might be acting on his own. It’s 
possible. I threw the other rock at 
the back of the cave and when he 
turned to follow the sound of where 
it landed — I think he was still 
dizzy — I had meant to give him a 
shot of something. I did. I really 
did. But there was no time. And I 
knew I must not let him touch me; 
then he’d know where I was. So I 
picked up another rock, picking up 
something in my head that wasn’t 
mine, too, that I still don’t know, 
and before he could get up, I hit 
him down and down again, just 
above the ear. 

Concussion, at best. 

So there’s no going back. 

“Alan?” said Cassie. 

Nathalie, John, Cassie. If no Val. 

I kept quiet. Cassie stepped out of 
my view and there was some sort of 
parley out there, little whisperings 
and scufflings about. 

“Hello in there!” said John Ude. 

I said nothing, “What do you 
want” being a question that in this 
case seemed rather obvious. 

“Hello?” he said. 

I cried, “You’ve got the water- 

GALAXY 




cycler, for God’s sake, you’ve got 
it!” 

He said, “But we want you back. 
We like your singing.” 

I said, “John, I only want to be 
by myself. I’ll give you the 
broomstick; I can push it out.” 
“Alan?” said someone, a wo- 
man’s voice. 

“Hibernating,” I said. “Out like 
a light. Your Hero bashed his head 
against the ceiling, which is very 
low. Showing his usual intelligence, 
which is likewise. If you’ll stand 
away from the entrance. I’ll push 
out the broomstick. No. I’ll break 
it, that’s better. Ruin it. Push out 
the pieces. That way nobody has it, 
you see?” There’s probably some- 
one else on the roof, but I can’t see 
the shadow. If I were there myself. 
I’d wait until I saw somebody come 
out, then jump them, maybe push 
them off the edge. There’s an old 
trick with a hat, but I haven’t got a 
hat. My ears all on edge waiting to 
hear Alan-Bobby stir, wishing he 
would, wishing he wouldn’t. I said, 
“Stand where I can see yOu.” 
Cassie moved into view in the 
cave opening on one side, Ude on 
the other. 

“And. .?” (said I) 

“Nath is ill,” he said. “We left 
her back home.” Back homel And 
Val and Nath and Cass — what a lot 
of intimacy has been developing in 
the last few days! I decided to be- 
lieve him, or pretend that I believed 
him, or act as if I were pretending 
that I did believe him. If there’s a 
fight, I might get broken. So I step- 
ped into the sunlight at the mouth 
of the cave — but not quite out — 
Until my eyes got accustomed to the 
light; it was a shock to see them 

We who are about to 



looking so grubby, so angry. They 
must’ve been drinking river water 
on the long march up. 

I said foolishly, “What’ve you 
been drinking?” 

“The same as you,” said John 
Ude, “see?” and he held up some- 
thing that caught the sun and spark- 
led wonderfully. “Compass,” he 
said. “Bet you didn’t know. 
There’s a magnetic field, all right. 
And you forgot that Nath was up 
this way before. We came over- 
land.” Then he yelled “Now!” and 
somebody dropped on me from 
above as he grabbed me, both to- 
gether, Nathalie undoubtedly be- 
cause it smelled like her, not that 
I’d ever noticed before. Fallen on 
sloppily, thus] with my face in the 
dust because I hadn’t had the sense 
to duck, and thinking only it was so 
odd that I did know what Nathalie 
smelled like. 

“Let her up,” said Ude. Big 
man. “Cass, go get Alan.” So I 
suppose Cassie went inside. I was 
not going to turn around to see; 
don’t want to get my back to the 
edge. I heard her moving around 
tentatively in there. Looked up so 
very carefully, hugging the ground: 
the woman to one side, the man to 
the other. Two bureaucrats. Look- 
ing up makes me dizzy. 

I started to cry. Because we 
never could be friends, I suppose. 
Cassie would be blinded by the 
dark, but not for long. There wasn’t 
much time. He leaned over me, the 
silly way you do when you think 
you’ve got somebody down; he put 
his hands on his hips and with as 
much angry relish as if he’d been 
talking to the whole damned planet 
itself, he said, “You’re mad. Did 



57 




you know that? We’re going to tie 
you to a tree with your hands be- 
hind so you can’t get loose. We can 
never trust you again.” 

I pulled his feet out from under 
him. He sat, or went down- back- 
wards along the ledge (I don’t know 
which) and 1 turned and shot in 
Nathalie’s direction, not even seeing 
her, not knowing if it would miss 
her or not. 

But she was awfully close. 

Gas-guns don’t make noise. 

I shot at him without seeing him. 
Following my motion with my eyes 
a moment later to see him — I think 
he was hit in the knee or 
something — clutching one thigh and 
standing on the other foot. There 
was a great roar behind me,, pebbles 
and boulders going over the edge 
down the bank. I shot him again., 
aiming this time, and — once he 
fell — kicked him down the slope. 
Another landslide. 

There was no one on top of the 
cave, no one on the hill. I suppose 
Val really hadn’t come. I felt even 
dizzier and waited on the empty 
ledge without standing up for Cass 
to come out with the broomstick, or 
discover Alan with his head beaten 
in and scream — and was he alive? 
And what would she do? And what 
would I do then? 

She came out empty-handed. No, 
with a rock in one hand. Blood on 
it. She dropped it to the ground 
with exaggerated calm, wiped her 
hands on her sheet-made-into-a- 
dress, and sat down cross-legged on 
the bare earth, which she did with 
astonishing graceiulness. Something 
to do with having been a dancer 
once, I suppose. Anyway, Cassie 
hadn’t wasted love on any of them. 

58 



“Well!” she said, peering over 
the edge, ‘‘you have been going it, 
haven’t you? Someone ought to 
give you a medal.” She licked her 
index finger, then tapped her own 
shoulder with her third finger. 
‘‘Run home before it dries.” 

I said nothing. 

She remarked conversationally, 
‘‘The prof person said you’d be up 
here. You know, along the water 
somewhere. Frankly, you should 
have gone a lot farther away. That’s 
what I would have done. I told them 
to let you alone.” 

I said, ‘‘Cassandra — ” 

She said, ‘‘I know, I know. If I 
had a baby, it would die. And if it 
didn’t, I would die. Anyway, my 
Mama had me by Caesarean.” 

She said, ‘‘I could tell you all 
about it, the kind of anesthetic, the 
scars, the stitches. God knows I 
heard about it enough.” She 
laughed. Swaggering Cassandra, the 
beautiful waitress, born to be a 
star, born to be a loser, doesn’t 
know that hard births don’t run in 
families. Not as simply as that. 

‘‘Oh damn them!” she said, 
‘‘damn them, don’t they ever even 
come back to look?”' 

I shook my head. 

She said, ‘‘What do we do now? 
Fight to the death? Like stupid 
Nathalie, who thought she was a 
man?” A social solecism Valeria 
Victrix would never have perpe- 
trated, despite her being a Mrs. But 
in Cassie ’s terms Cassie is right, I 
suppose. 

“Here,” she said harshly, mak- 
ing me jump, “give me that,” and 
reaching out in an absurdly unba- 
lanced position, she had the gas-gun 
in her hand and was trying to get 

GALAXY 




her fingers round it. It’s a flat, 
half-shapeless piece, because it’s 
designed to be hidden, and you 
have to know how to use it. I shut 
my eyes. “Careful!” Not like this. 

“Give me that stuff,” said Cas- 
sandra the brava. “Right now.” 

“What?” I said, opening my 
eyes. 

“That stuff you’re always carry- 
ing,” she said sharply. “You’ve 
got it about you somewhere. You’re 
too much of a coward to be without 
it.” She turned red. “Trust you not 
to go around without carrying every 
kind of poison there is, you viper! 
Alwants wants a way out, doesn’t 
she? Give it!” 

So I did. I popped from my belt 
two pellets, which I put on the 
ground between us under those an- 
gry, angry eyes, two greenish-grey, 
extra-special, euphoric exits that 
looked just like Cassie’s eyes. They 
fetched a great deal in the market 
once. And are fetching a great deal 
right now. 

I said, “Please don’t throw that 
down.” I meant the gun. She put it 
more carefully down in the dust be- 
tween us. I watched her pick up the 
pills. I think I was shaking. 
Something — not me — said, “Cas- 
sandra, I would be very pleased to 
share your company. Very grate- 
ful.” 

“I ought to poison your water,” 
she said, “but I won’t. I’ll go do it 
somewhere else. What do you do? 
Swallow them?” 

I nodded. She was showing off 
®gain, Cassie the 3-D Cat, Cassie 
^he actress. 

“Now you can go kill Lori,” she 
^?id. She started to pick her way 
Sideways over the hill, a little age-

ing in her imitation peplum or 
whatever it was. Then she stopped, 
and turned back, and smiled. 

“Honored to share my company, 
huh?” she said. She added: 

“For how many years?” 

Then she went away. 

* * ★ 

Alan-Bobby was dead. No pulse 
in his groin, no chest movement. I 
used the broomstick to haul 
Nathalie’s and John Ude’s bodies 
from the stream-bed, one at a time, 
and take them a good km. or so 
downstream; they could rot there. 
Dead people are like sandbars but 
in odd shapes because they keep 
folding up, and because they were 
still warm; I kept getting irritated at 
them for flinging their arms and 
legs out like that and not helping 
me. I think that’s characteristic. I 
left Alan alone, because I was tired, 
and decided to go' downstream. 
From high enough (I was not stuck 
with the water now) you can see the 
river winding like a silver snake in 
the distance and the grey-green 
brush folded over on itself in hill af- 
ter hill, each darker and stranger 
than the last, plum-colored at the 
horizon. League upon league. A 
rumpled, painted tablecloth where 
the glaciers had come down. I went 
down by the side of the stream this 
time and much straighter, leaving a 
snake of flattened vegetation over 
the hills. Watch it after you pass 
and you can see it slowly straighten 
up. 

I had to go down. 

Otherwise they might have to de- 
cide to come up to me.

SPIDER ROBINSON 



IT^S A 



SUNNY 

DAY 



OIGN HERE. 

Zack looked a bit dubiously at 
the bespectacled boy who sat sur- 
rounded by travelcases in the mid- 
dle of his kitchen, then at the silent 
giant who had carried in the travel- 
cases, finally at the bald slender 
man who had spoken. The latter 
held out a clipboard and stylus in 
his pale hand. His voice was flat 
and emotionless, and he wore 
grey — Zack decided it suited him. 

“Glad to, Mr. .” 

“Jacob Abernathy,” the grey 
man said, seeming to bite off the 
Words. 

He glanced around the room in ap- 
parent disapproval. 

“Pleased to meet you, Jake. 
I’m . .” 



“I know who you are.” Zack 
had stuck out his hand; Abernathy 
gazed at it without particular in- 
terest. Zack took the clipboard with 
it and made his chop, handed it 
back. 

“You tell Raoul that I’ll take 
good care of his . .” 

“His Excellency will be informed 
that you have accepted delivery,” 
Abernathy clipped. Zack blinked. 
He adjusted his overalls on one 
broad shoulder and took his pipe 
from one of many pockets. Locating 
a pouch in another, he stoked up 
and emitted clouds of blue smoke, 
squinting at Abernathy. “You just 
do that, brother. Sorry you can’t 
stay for lunch.” 

The sarcasm was lost on Aber- 



61 




nathy. “Food is available on board 
the ship.” 

“What you call food, yeah. Good 
day to you.” Abernathy nodded and 
left, followed by the huge manser- 
vant. Zack went to the window and 
watched them depart, puffing on his 
pipe. “Never seen a shirt so stuffed 
mass so little,” he murmured, and 
shook his head, eyes twinkling. 

He turned back to the boy who 
still sat silently amid his belongings 
in the rich, blitter- yellow sunlight of 
early morning. The plunder nearly 
filled half the kitchen, pressure-tight 
suitcases designed to withstand sud- 
den vacuum. Zack ran a calloused 
hand through his thick wiry red hair 
and grinned around his pipe at the 
youth. 

“Sure a lot of swag, old son,” 
he drawled. “You too proud to 
shake hands too?” 

The boy shook his head, rose 
from his seat. “Tm Timeth Con- 
nery,” he said, his thin voice as 
emotionless as Abernathy’s. Zack 
shook his hand gravely. 

“I am Zachary Mountain-Born, 
and this is the T.A., my home.” 

The boy’s bland expression — or 
absence of any — changed slightly.,, 
“Mountain-Born?” he asked. 
“What kind of last name is that?” 

“Why, mine,” said Zack, some- 
what startled. 

“A surname is functional, an 
identifier,” Timeth said, seeming to 
recite. “It is a family -referent and 
locator. Was your father also named 
Mountain-Bom?” 



“Why no. My father was Jody 
Sunray and my mother was Kerry 
Maplewood. We like to use sur- 
names creatively here on New 
Home.” 

The boy digested this. Zack im- 
agined lights blinking, chided his 
imagination sharply. 

“What does T.A.’ stand for?” 

“ ‘Total Anarchy,’ ” Zack said 
grinning. “This house was built by 
Daniel, one of the First Landed, la- 
ter called Daniel of the Woods. He 
ceremonially destroyed his T-square 
before beginning this place; there 
isn’t a right angle in the building.” 
He realized his grin was unshared, 
felt foolish. “Don’t you understand 
jokes?” 

“I understand the theory and 
purpose of jokes,” Timeth replied. 
“Was that one?” 

Zack blinked, then suddenly burst 
out laughing. “Guess you couldn’t 
be expected to appreciate a joke 
about anarchy at that, Tim. Not com- 
ing from a world like Velco. Well, 
never mind. You’ll find things here 
to make you laugh. I hope.” 

Timeth regarded him intently, 
seeming to size Zack up — he had 
the feeling the lad could tell his 
shirt-size and annual income. “One 
of the standard purposes of the 
‘joke’ is to make another feel at 
ease,” Timeth stated. “Was that 
your wish?” 

“It surely was,” Zack assured 
him. 

“Then tell me why I am here.” 

Zack started, then his brow 



62 



GALAXY 




clouded. “Well I’ll be a ... do 
you mean to tell me they didn’t ex- 
plain to you why you’re here?” The 
boy shook his head. “Might have 
expected it — pure Velco,’’ Zack 
exploded, and swore. “I thought 
better of Raoul.’’ He saw Timeth 
looking at him, waiting. “I’m sor- 
ry, old son. Didn’t mean to criticize 
your father; I knew him in college. 
But to truck you thirty parsecs and 
leave you in a stranger’s kitchen 
with never a word of why . .’’ He 
shook his head. “Let’s sit down.’’ 

He led Timeth from the kitchen 
to his broad-beamed living room, 
just a bit of prideful expectancy in 
his manner. He had added some to 
Daniel’s original structure, and the 
living room was his showpiece. 

A visitor’s first impression was 
usually that a rainbow had been 
trapped in the room and battered it- 
self to pieces trying to escape: while 
the great south window gave a clear 
view of the mountain sloping away 
to an azure bay, the east and west 
windows were stained glass mosaic, 
and the former of these now span- 
gled the room with splashes of red 
and yellow and green and deep, rich 
blue. Zack watched Timeth for reac- 
tion, found none. He sighed, 
pointed to a chair and draped his 
own long, hard form on a rocker. 
He busied himself for awhile with 
his pipe, then fired up a fresh bowl 
and began. 

“The way I get the story, 
Timeth — and you correct me if I’m 
Wrong anywhere — Velco is in a hell

of a pickle. Overpopulated, overin- 
dustrialized, overurbanized — just 
one big city, the way I hear it. 
They failed to learn the lessons of 
Old Terra, and so they got into a 
bind for efficient administration. 
Too much information to integrate. 
Computers weren’t the answer, they 
don’t correlate well enough. A 
computer can have the results of 
five different medical teams around 
a planet punched into it, and never 
see that, combined, those results 
mean a cure for Ashton’s 
Disease — or whatever. So the Vel- 
coi fastened on an ancient but un- 
tried notion from Old Terra, attri- 
buted to a man named Heinlein, 
made about the time that it stopped 

63 



being possible for a normal man to 
absorb all known information in a 
single lifetime. They began tinker- 
ing with ova in utero, selecting for 
eidetic memory, and set about rais- 
ing up a corps of encyclopedic 
synthesists: a group of men trained 
to absorb raw information at high 
input with perfect retention, and 
then reason from it. Sort of human 
computers; you’re one of the first. 

“They tell me you can read a 
page at a glance, Basic English or 
Fortran, and remember it a decade 
from now, letter-perfect in a cafe 
with the band playing. You know 
enough to converse intelligently 
with experts in a hundred 
specialized disciplines, and direct 
their work for maximum efficiency. 
They trained and sleep-taught and 
indoctrinated you in logical and 
non-logical analysis until you were 
eight, stuffed you with data until 
you were twelve, gave you four 
years to integrate it and then put 
you to work at sixteen. Only you 
didn’t work. 

“Not the way they hoped, any- 
how. They fed you data on pressing 
social problems, not big stuff, just 
break-in exercises; and your solu- 
tions were unsatisfactory or barely 
so, not much better than the com- 
puters could do. So they sicced 
their psychiatrists on you, and their 
psychologists, and they turned you 
inside out and found nothing wrong. 
They tore you down and rebuilt you 
and you still don’t make miracles. 
And so in desperation some 

64 



would-be Freud stole another notion 
from Old Terra and recommended a 
vacation in the country — in this case 
a vacation on New Home, an ag- 
ricultural colony, world, with me.” 
Zack paused, relit his pipe. “I 
knew your Dad — we were room- 
mates in school on Trantor, and he 
told me a lot about the YES 
program — Young Encyclopedic 

Synthesists. He was mighty proud 
that his wife back home had been 
selected for genetic surgery. Won- 
der how he feels now.” He stared 
at the distant bay below, then 
wrenched himself from his thoughts 
with a visible effort. “Anyway, 
that’s the long and short of it, Tim. 
You’re here for R and R — six 
months of it. How does that appeal 
to you?” 

Behind his enormous spectacles 
(which could be returned to fisheye 
lens for maximum optic input) 
Timeth regarded Zack gravely. “It 
is satisfactory.” 

“I said, ‘Does it appeal to you?’ 
Do you like the notion?” 

For the first time Timeth hes- 
itated. “Y . yes I do. The last 
few months have been ... in- 
tensely strenuous.” 

“And strenuously intense, if I 
know Velcoi shrinks,” Zack 
snorted. “Well, that’s all over for 
awhile, lad. Smile.” He beamed 
himself, nodded at the south win- 
dow. “It’s a sunny day.” 

Timeth looked out at sun- 
drenched splendor, at stately maples 
which had crossed light-years as sap-

lings and at native spruce whose 
skirts danced in the mountain 
breeze, and returned his gaze to 
Zack. “There is no more sun than 
on any other day. I fail to under- 
stand your pleasure simply because 
it’s visible . oh, I see. As a 
farmer you are pleased that 
maximum growth-frequencies are 
available to your crops.” 

“Why, no,” said Zack, startled. 
“I mean, that’s all fine, but . 
but . ” He broke off, words failing 
him, and pointed at the window again. 
"'Look. It’s a sunny day.” 

The boy looked, kept on looking. 

“You ought to appreciate it; you 
haven’t seen many, have you? I 
hear Velco is completely roofed 
over, to simplify atmosphere recy- 
cling. Must use artificial light, 
right?” 

“Sunlight is relayed inside the 
city by a series of mirror-bank 
transfer-and-amplification complex- 
es,” Timeth said flatly. “Vitamin 
D is essential for health.” 

Zack’s jaw dropped; he lost his 
pipe. They literally pipe daylight in 
to ’em, he thought. Holy smoke, 
what a dungeon. 

He gave up, took refuge in 
manners-toward-a-houseguest. The 
T.A. held five bedrooms, four of 
which he customarily sealed off in 
winter to conserve heat. Although 
Autumn already lay on this quadrant 
of New Home, he had left all five 
open, and invited Timeth to take his 
pick. All were furnished and clean 
but not especially orderly: Zack had 

IT'S A SUNNY DAY 



felt that a .newcomer would feel 
most welcome in a room that felt 
lived-in. The boy selected the small- 
est and most functional room, 
hardly more than a square box with 
a mattress on the floor and a small 
table. It had no window. Zack 
shrugged and carried in the travel- 
cases, stacking them for maximum 
access. Timeth opened one of the 
seals with an economical movement 
of his small thin hand, and began 
removing toilet articles. “What are 
my duties?” he asked stiffly. 

Well, if I'm supposed to find out 
what’s wrong with his working 
habits . “None at all,” Zack 
said cheerfully. “Do what suits 
you — or nothing. Any help you feel 
like giving will be appreciated, but 
you owe me none. Your father paid 
your rent for you, twenty years 
ago — by teaching astrogational 
mechanics to an ignorant farmer of 
a roomate.” 

Timeth stared. “I cannot solve a 
problem without parameters,” he 
stated. 

“Just keep your eyes open, old 
son. You’ll catch on,” Zack as- 
sured him heartily. He hoped that 
he sounded more confident than he 
felt. 

* * * 

The next few days passed slowly, 
grey weather hiding the sun, and 
Zack’s puzzlement increased daily. 
Timeth indeed found things to do, 
and did them with maximum effi- 
ciency, but his performance was 



65 




consistently lackluster. 

Sent to fetch water from the 
stream while Zack repaired a 
water-pump which had slipped its 
leathers, he reappeared from the 
forest staggering under the weight 
of two buckets fuller than Zack 
would have filled them, struggling 
valiantly uphill. He was frustrated 
by his inability to deliver perfectly 
full buckets, and shed tears approx- 
imately equal in volume to the 
amount spilled. 

Partly soothed by Zack’s assur- 
ance that he had fetched a-plenty, 
he set about cutting up onions for 
the midday stew — and produced 
precise cubes of onion as uniform 
as his small hands could make 
them. 

When Zack mentioned, casually, 
that they could use some firewood, 
he was shortly startled by the stut- 
tering roar of his ancient 
chainsaw — a device of which he 
was certain Timeth had only empir- 
ical knowledge. He had expected 
the lad would use the pulp saw 
which hung in the woodshed. Leav- 
ing his cooking and wandering out- 
side to investigate, he found Timeth 
in a silent rage, annoyed not by the 
enormous demand the snarling, 
bucking chainsaw put on his young 
arms, but by the refusal of the ir- 
regular logs to lie down neatly and 
be sawed. Probably never met with 
a piece of unplaned wood in his 
life, Zack thought, and tried to ex- 
plain that the logs’ tendency to leap 
from the sawhorse and savage one’s 



knees was an interesting challenge 
rather than a defect in their struc- 
ture, but he had little success — 
Timeth ’s early training had led him 
to define “challenge” as “a prob- 
lem they don’t expect me to be able 
to solve.” The boy went grimly 
back to work, generating a moun- 
tain of firewood as neat as a 
postcard-picture but no joy. Zack 
shook his head, sighed for the 
dozenth time and went back inside. 

The uneasiness persisted as the 
grey, rainy days of the season con- 
tinued to unfold, and Zack lay 
awake nights trying to put his finger ' 
on the problem. The boy played 
chess like an automation, winning ! 
consistently and emotionlessly, con- ? 
tinned to perform household tasks - 
adequately but with an undercurrent 
of feeling that might have been sul- 
lenness had it not been so mild. He 
never roamed the mountain, though 
a forest environment was certainly 
new to him, and seemed uncomfort- 
able when he could not find a task 
to accomplish, a problem to solve. 
Even his constant displays of ency- 
clopedic knowledge, which saved 
Zack man-hours on several occa- 
sions, contained no tinge of pride, 
but only a weary boredom. Damn 
it, the boy simply had no juice. 
Could it be simply homesickness? 

One damp morning Timeth 
coughed after breakfast, and asked 
diffidently if he could have his bed *

Velco invariably hummed with 
power, the electronic systems which 
were the city-world’s lifeblood puls- 
ing beneath floorboards. By associa- 
tion he heard them here on New 
Home, and a psychosomatic an- 
noyance is as real as any other. 
Zack assented readily, and they 
studied the three bedframes the 
T.A. held. 

“Doesn’t look like any of these 
will fit through the door of that 
closet you picked to live in, Timi. I 
guess you’ll have to build you a 
bed.” Zack expected the boy to ask 
for help, as he was sure carpentry 
was not a skill Timeth could have 
acquired on a steel-and-plastic 
world, but the boy only nodded and 
started measuring the mattress. Zack 
busied himself with the dishes, ob- 
serving unobtrusively out of the 
corner of his eye. Having obtained 
the dimensions, Timeth put on a 
coat and went out into the morning 
mists, to the lumber pile out back. 
He returned with a pair of tongue- 
and-groove boards, repeated the 
process until he had stacked a dozen 
of them in his room, then fetched 
two long two-by-fours and four 
four-by-fours. Zack interrupted his 
labors to provide hammer, nails and 
handsaw, then returned to the kitch- 
en. As always, the boy worked in 
silence, save for the pounding and 
sawing the job required. Zack let 
him be, spent the afternoon cleaning 
his survey-laser. 

At noon Timeth emerged, his 
spectacles coated with a fine spray

of sawdust. Zack left off caning a 
chair, one of his favorite forms of 
relaxation, and went to inspect the 
new bedframe, easing past the mat- 
tress that partially filled the door- 
way. He blinked at what he saw, 
said nothing at first. 

“I’m not certain the legs are re- 
ally perpendicular,” Timeth said 
uneasily. “I didn’t have a level or a 
T-square.” 

“ ‘How do you tell if your wife 
is true?’ ” Zack quoted. “ ‘Check 
her out with a plumb-bob.’ Never 
mind, old son. Another of my bum 
jokes. About the bed: it’s . it’s 
very functional.” 

They boy looked pleased. 

. but I can’t say that I like 
it.”

Timeth was briefly crestfallen, 
then his features smoothed into their 
usual blank. “Why not?” 

Zack started to answer, then 
stopped. He turned and walked into 
the living room, the boy following, 
and sat down with a frown. Timeth 
waited. 

After a time Zack spoke. 
“Timeth, I’m beginning to under- 
stand why you had trouble on Vel- 
co. Hell, it sticks out all over — it’s 
so obvious I couldn’t grasp it.” 

“You must tell me,’’ the boy 
said, and Zack was startled by the 
intensity in his voice. 

“Why must I tell you, Timi?” he 
asked softly. 

“Because I have shamed my 
father,” Timi said shortly, turning 
red. For him, it was an emotional 
outburst. 

Zack swore, with feeling. “You 
poor kid. They couldn’t get the re- 
sults they wanted out of you, so 
they applied pressure on your moti- 
vation circuits, figuring you were 
stubborn. And so they made you 
ashamed — and that’s one of the 
stubbornest places there is. Per- 
petuated their own problem. Serves 
them right— but it doesn’t serve you 
at all. 

“Listen, lad. You’ve been pro- 
grammed for maximum efficiency. 
But as much as your father and that 
Abernathy creature would like to 
believe otherwise, people aren’t 
built to be satisfied with merely ef- 
ficient solutions to their problems. 
Suited, maybe, but not satisfied. 

68 



People are irrational, Timeth, in a 
way you’ve never been allowed to 
be. lliey want to enjoy life.” 

Timeth displayed no comprehen- 
sion. 

“Take that bed you Just built. 
You went to the lumber-pile and 
picked up the first bunch of boards 
that fit your parameters, the right 
size, the right length. And you 
stopped looking. You figured out 
the most economical use of wood 
and nails and designed your bed- 
frame. And stopped thinking. You 
fit the tongue-and-grooves together, 
spanned them with two-by-fours to 
distribute the load, and added legs. 
And stopped building. It’ll hold 
your weight and it’s the size of the 
mattress, but it’s as spartan as a 
K-ration, as cheerless as a utility 
pole. It’s functional, but that’s all it 
is.” 

The boy looked close to tears. 
Zack suspected that he was having 
his equivalent of hysterics, but 
pushed on anyway. “I know what 
your problem is, Timeth, and it’s 
the problem with your whole world: 
the reason why they needed you to 
pull their chestnuts out of the fire in 
the first place and the reason why 
you can’t do it, all in one. 

“Look: a certain number of 
chores must be done in order to 
live — call it life support. Because 
your world is so confounded 
crowded the nature of those chores 
become complex and subtle — from 
hydraulic engineering to solar power 
conversion to piping in the bloody 

GALAXY 




daylight. All I need is food and 
firewood, so I’m not as pressured. 
But when life-support chores be- 
come too complex to allow for the 
kind of cheerful inefficiency with 
which I run this farm, people don’t 
enjoy doing them, or living with the 
end-results. 

“Look at my kitchen-stove some- 
time. It’s a wood-burner, as old as 
underwear and as big as a landing- 
field. It keeps me busy wrestling 
that chainsaw, and its not an espe- 
cially efficient heat-source. I make 
a pretty good living from this 
farm — I could afford gas. Hell, I 
could afford a solar stove. But I like 
that old heap of iron. It was my 
mother’s; it has stains on it that she 
made fixing my school Icrnches. It 
keeps the room cheery and warm of 
a winter’s night. I don’t have to cut 
wood for it — so I don’t begrudge 
the energy it consumes. 

“But more important than that, 
Timeth, the chores that I do have 
immediate personal results, of a 
tangible sort. I spend an hour cut- 
ting up vegetables into interesting 
shapes instead of neat cubes, and 
somehow my soup tastes better to 
me, and it looks different every 
time. I spend a few weeks over at 
Yang Wildflower’s house learning 
to blow glass, and my living room 
wears a coat of many colors that 
changes as the day goes by, and 
changes with the seasons, too. I 
make the upstairs dormer I put on 
this house much wider than I need 
it — but I can sit in the window-sill 

IT'S A SUNNY DAY 



with my feet up, come sundown, 
and watch the sun set over the bay 
that my father used to fish. 

“You spend a week of hard men- 
tal labor and produce a more effi- 
cient traffic-routing system for use 
halfway around the planet, or a 
step-up in distribution of goods 
you’ll never see. Meanwhile your 
own life-support comes from cans 
and boxes and grilles in the ceiling, 
from supermarkets and factories 
rather than from the earth and sky. 
You don’t feel the effect you have 
on your world, and so it is mean- 
ingless to you. No wonder your 
solutions don’t satisfy your con- 
stituents. 

“Go look at my bed; you’ve seen 
it already. Big four-poster with a 
canopy overhead made from a 
genuine Carson’s World tapestry 
and a tape- viewer built in. Stereo 
speakers in a headboard of gnurled 
oak that’s got a gold sunburst 
painted in the middle. That bed 
doesn’t just hold me off the floor — 
it gives me pleasure. Sometimes it’s 
hard to get out of it in the morning. 
Sometimes I don’t. 

“Dammit, son, there’s some 
driftwood that you didn’t get to, out 
there on the lumber pile, that’d 
make the prettiest bedframe you 
ever saw, with more interesting con- 
tours than any straight line ever mil- 
led. There’s one big slab that bay 
worked over for near a century, 
with that smooth, timeless texture 
that only driftwood has, that’d make 
a headboard as majestic as this 

69 




mountain we’re sitting on. And as 
asymmetrical — so you never noticed 
it. Instead of a pleasing place to 
spend a third of your every day, 
you produced a piece of floor with 
legs on it. Instead of an interesting 
soup you produced a homogenous 
pot of cubes. Instead of a lived-in 
room you’ve produced a collection 
of right angles that’s as efficient 
and as lifeless as a laboratory maze. 

“Function, function, function! 
Timeth, human beings aren’t built 
to live functionally. Dum near ev- 
erything in this house, from kettle 
to cupboard, is decorated some way 
or other, and so the house is full of 
me. If I’m an unimaginative man, 
then they’re unimaginative decora- 
tions, but they satisfy me and they 
say who I am. Your room says only 
what Velco is. 

“Confound it, boy! Didn’t any- 
one ever teach you how to enjoy 
yourself?’’ 

Timeth burst out crying, the 
great, racking sobs of a very small 
child or a grown man. Zack sud- 
denly cursed himself for a fool. Ris- 
ing, he held out his arms blindly, 
and the boy as blindly rushed into 
them. “You poor slob,” he mur- 
mured, stroking Timeth’s hair, 
“They trained you how to work like 
a ballerina — and they never taught 
you how to play.” His face dark- 
ened. “I guess you can’t play 
. if you live on Velco.” 

The boy’s sobs intensified. 

But finally his crying became less 
explosive, began to subside. His 

70 



trembling ceased. He lifted his face, 
and the stained glass window turned 
his tears to tiny diamonds, rubies 
and amethysts. “Zack,” he 
pleaded, “will you teach me how to 
enjoy myself?” 

Zack was startled to discover that 
his own vision was blurred; 
Timeth’s face became a small, oval 
kaleidoscope. 

“I’ll try, son,” he said, his voice 
hoarse. “I’ll try.” 

* * * 

The winter was long, but unsea- 
sonably mild. Nonetheless Zack got 
very little accomplished around the 
house — but it was a very full time 
all the same. There were hay rides 
and fishing trips and husking bees, 
happy smiling neighbors too seldom 
seen. There were square-dances 
where Timeth danced until his legs 
refused to support him and he gig- 
gled, gasping, on his knees at how 
the mathematical relationships of 
the dance melted away before the 
sheer Joy of it. There were beer- 
brewing parties and barn-raising 
celebrations at which he learned for 
the first time the joy of cooperation, 
of shared labor. There was a holi- 
day feast where he glowed at the 
compliments bestowed on a cake he 
had fashioned in the shape of the 
T.A., with frosted windows, icing 
sills and trim, and a fine-grain ■ 
chocolate roof for all the world like ; 
tar-paper. And there were endless| 
nature walks and countless camping! 

GALAXY I 




trips and a hundred color-splashed 
sunsets; there were windy days on 
the shore racking for driftwood and 
sweet winter nights singing New 
Home songs and Velcoi ballads by 
the fireside until eyelids stung with 
the weight of happy fatigue; there 
was snow to be shoveled and trees 
to be felled, a boat to be built and 
sap to be collected and boiled down 
into thick, gold syrup. 

And one chill night there was a 
chimney fire and Timeth heard it 
first and they sprang from their beds 
to become twin whirlwinds of 
wordlessly coordinated energy, and 
there was chopping of timbers and 
tearing down of boards and Timeth 
at the pump, with new-grown mus- 
cle efficiently pumping, keeping the 
full buckets coming, and Zack, di- 
sheveled and red in the glow of 
firebox and embers, his great shoul- 
ders rippling as he swung the great 
double-headed axe that Timeth had 
remembered to snatch up as they 
raced past the shop; and then there 
was a policing for embers in which 
time slowed down some, and then 
at last Zack and Timeth, panting on 
their knees, locking eyes for the 
first time, dissolving into laughter at 
the same instant, great echoing 
whoops of laughter that seemed to 
blow the smoke and the stink from 
the room; and Zack, reaching out to 
shake Timeth’s hand and saying the 
first words spoken since Timeth’s 
cry had woken him: “Pleasure to 
work with you, partner.” And the 
boy’s face was something that Jacob 

IT'S A SUNNY DAY 



Abernathy would not have recog- 
nized 

And one slightly warmer night, 
Timeth returned from three days 
alone in the woods, healthy and fit 
and profoundly alive, and he asked 
Zachary Mountain-Bom a question, 
and Zack made the answer which he 
had prepared. 

And one pleasant Spring evening, 
two weeks later, Zack was sitting 
alone on a bluff overlooking the 
garden, watching the stars, when a 
darkness occulted one of them. The 
star reappeared and its neighbor 
vanished, and he smiled a soft smile 
and went in to bed, sleeping 
soundly for the first time in a 
month, waking before dawn for the 
first time in years. 

* * * 

The knock came as the coffee 
was perking, and Zack carefully slid 
the pot to a cooler place on the 
stove before he answered the door. 
Abernathy walked in without greet- 
ing, followed by the large manser- 
vant, and the three of them stood 
for a moment, regarding each other. 
For Zack it was almost a moment of 
deja vu — the same kitchen, the 
same people, the same stack of 
travelcases awash with the light of 
dawning. 

But Abernathy methodically as- 
sessed the room, identified the mis- 
sing element, and frowned. “Where 
is the boy?” 



71 




“The boy is dead,” Zack said 
truthfully. “He will not be returning 
with you.” 

Abernathy’s planed features had 
never held emotion, and were not 
about to start at this late date, but 
he looked as if he wished his eye- 
brows would let him frown. 

“There was an avalanche last 
week,” Zack explained. “A 
rockslide to the east. I watched him 
fall. I could not recover his body. 
Tell Raoul I ...” he broke off, 
strong emotion on his own face. 

Abernathy stood stock-still for a 
long moment, nodded and said, “I 
see. Was his death your fault?” 

“No,” Zack said slowly, “it was 
his own doing.” 

Abernathy read truth in his sturdy 
face, and nodded again. Without 
another word he spun on his heel 
like a drill instructor and left. The 
servant followed with the forlorn 
travelcases. 

Zack watched from the window 
until the landing craft rose into view 
from the tall neopines at the base of 
the mountain and arced off over the 
bay toward the orbiting mothership 
he had seen in the sky last night. 
Then he put down his empty coffee 
cup and went to the smallest room 
in his house. As he opened its door 
he noted with approval that the sun- 
burst painted on its door was dry 
now. 

A new-carved, diamond-shaped 
window let in the morning sun; it 
splashed across a great majestic 
bed, seasoned maple timbers and a 

72 



mighty slab of driftwood for a 
headboard, held together by careful, 
macrame-like lashings of thick blue 
cord, a great canopy arching over- 
head with a hand-stitched represen- 
tation of this sector of the galaxy on 
its undersurface. It was nowise per- 
fect or neat, but its craftsman had 
obviously enjoyed himself. 

Zack coughed. “All clear, old 
son.” 

From beneath the magnificent bed 
came — not a boy — but a young 
man, the beginning of an eager 
grim below a proud, new mustache. 
“They’re really gone, Zack?” 

“They’re really gone, Timeth. 
They won’t be coming back.” 

“I ... I guess I’ll miss my par- 
ents some.” The grin faltered. 

“I guess you will,” Zack agreed, 
wondering for the thousandth time 
whether he had chosen rightly. 

Timeth shrugged, and his grin re- 
turned full strength. “Even feeling 
bad is better than not feeling,” he 
said positively, and to his own sur- 
prise Zack laughed. They embraced 
fora moment, as comrades-in-arms, 
and then Timeth pulled away smil- 
ing. “Let’s go outside, Zack,” he 
said. “There’s a shed to be built.” 

“Whoa, lad. What about break- 
fast?” 

“The hell with breakfast,” 
Timeth said, and raced to the win- 
dow. Flinging it open, he breathed 
in a great chestful of spruce and 
earth and distant sea. 

“Look!” he cried, pointing. “It’s 
a sunny day!” ★

SHATTERED HOPES, 
BROKEN BREAMS 



Sometimes, on nights when 
THE WIND has swept the clouds and 
the smog into someone else’s sky, I 
look up at the haughty stars and 
wonder whether he was a terrified 
reactionary, afraid to live in a world 
with suddenly infinite horizons, or 
whether he was only a mad, desper- 
ate football fan. Not that it matters 
much. 

* * * 

The Perspe had come to the Unit- 
ed Nations as spokesmen for a 
great galactic organization. And, 
humbling as it might be, our planet 
wasn’t being invited to join, but 
was merely being informed of the 
rules of interstellar travel. Earth was 
being told, quite explicitly, that if it 
obeyed those laws its presence 



would be tolerated; otherwise it 
would find itself in a predicament. 

The Perspe had one, specific pur- 
pose; they couldn’t discuss more al- 
luring matters: trade, cultural ex- 
changes, and — most important of 
all — technology. They did say that 
after their mission had been com- 
pleted, other races could conduct 
bilateral talks with us. That was 
enough to make the U.N. diplomats 
work like dogs to understand the 
laws of the interstellar sea, and to 
codify them in ways that would be 
clear to all the peoples of the world. 

Eventually that brought me into 
it. During the initial exchanges, the 
translation devices of the Perspe had 
been a boon — but as negotiations 
grew more subtle, they could no 
longer convey nuances adequately. 
'The finer the shade of meaning, the 



75 




less likely it was that it could be 
made clear to the other party. They 
also had difficulty choosing the 
most appropriate of conflicting def- 
initions. Several times talks had 
been totally sidetracked when the 
computers had picked the wrong 
word. 

The Perspe kept a tight rein on 
their tempers even when we seemed 
to be insulting them. 

Nevertheless, the talks had almost 
collapsed during a discussion of 
salvage rights. The American Am- 
bassador’s, “Does the finder of a 
derelict take possession?”, had be- 
come, “Does one who encounters a 
broken-down alcoholic have the 
right to enslave him?” After giving 
their equivalent of a sigh, the 
Perspe declared that it was time for 
flesh and blood interpreters. They 
then suspended negotiations while 
they trained some. 

My application was in the mail 
fifteen minutes after I saw their ad. 
The salary and career opportunities 
were attractive but that wasn’t the 
reason I almost wrecked my car get- 
ting to the Post Office. I wanted the 
job because . how can I make 
you, who are satisfied with this 
world and this life, understand why 
I’m not? I mean, it’s okay, as far as 
it goes, but it’s dull. I’ve always 
had an urge, a drive, to ... to see 
a temple without first having seen it 
in an art book. Or to bum golden 
brown on a beach that doesn’t grace 
a hotel brochure. Or to buy a trinket 
that catches my fancy, without wor- 

76 



rying that it was made for the 
tourist trade. 

Do you understand? I want to 
form an opinion of a new locale all 
on my own, without having my 
brain pushed and pulled and patted 
into place by two or three earlier 
generations of tourists. I want, if 
you’ll forgive me, to be the very 
first human ever to have gone 
to . wherever I’ve gone. So I 
applied for the job. 

A month later, a special delivery 
letter arrived, requesting that I come 
to New York for an interview with 
the Perspe. I took the next flight 
out. 

I’m still not entirely sure why 
they chose me. It was probably my 
knack for languages. (I speak Rus- 
sian, Chinese, Arabic, as well as 
my native English) combined with 
my four years of experience in 
teaching. Also, I suspect that the 
Perspe wanted some more-or-less 
normal adults to balance the other 
students: three linguists who were 
going to make a systematic study of 
Perspean, and three children, who’d 
been selected because youngsters 
pick up languages rapidly and are 
relatively free of cultural bias. We 
were definitely a mixed bag. 

* ii it 

The Perspe, short and squat, bear 
a distracting resemblance to over- 
sized bullfrogs. Their skin is green, 
their hands and feet are webbed, 
and their great pop-eyes are 

GALAXY 




mounted high on flattened heads. 
And they eat bugs. 

The Perspe who interviewed me 
apologized for that at the outset. As 
I eased into the steel-framed leather 
chair, the speaker on his desk put 
his guttural rumble into English: 
“Please forgive me, Mr. Schelly, 
but the insects of your world are de- 
licious. Please do not feel you are 
being insulted if I snatch a small 
snack now and again — rather, it is a 
compliment. This is the first world 
on which I have found palatable in- 
sect life.” 

Since the computer had said noth- 
ing about the manner in which the 
Perspe would catch insects, I was 
unprepared. I’d sort of expected 
him to grab at a fly with his hand, 
or swat one with a folded news- 
paper, or something along those 
lines. But a minute later, I heard a 
buzzing in the air above my left ear; 
the Perspe’s wide mouth parted and 
1 saw a flash of pink. My ears reg- 
istered a tiny pop and the Perspe’s 
mouth closed. “Delicious,” crack- 
led the speaker. 

The verbal part of the interview 
was routine. The Perspe asked the 
usual questions, got the usual 
answers, and seemed to be as satis- 
fied. The only difference was that I 
had a sense of being . tasted, I 
guess. 

I don’t know how to describe it. 
Imagine being licked, stared at, 
smelled, listened to, and stroked, all 
at the same time. Imagine further 
that the other person isn’t doing it 

SHAHERED HOPES, BROKEN DREAMS 



for sensual pleasure, but because he 
wants to find out exactly what 
you’re like. Not approval, not dis- 
approval, simply examination. It’s 
unsettling. 

Not that the Perspe stirred from 
his side of the spacious mahogany 
desk: It wasn’t a physical inspec- 
tion,, even though it seemed like 
one. It was . well, it was my 
impression that he was straining his 
every sensory input to learn all he 
could about me. 

Also, his effort to receive the 
data my body emitted seemed 
somehow not entirely passive, but 
more like radar or sonar than like 
“normal” senses. 

The Perspe are nearly telepathic. 
They can’t read thoughts, but they 
are very high-grade empaths; my in- 
terviewer couldn’t tell what I was 
thinking, but he could tell what I 
was feeling — and on that basis he 
could guess at my thoughts. Not 
very accurately, at first, but as time 
went on he got better. Much better. 

That’s why the Perspe represent 
the other space-travelling races of 
the galaxy. Their talent helps them 
understand the species they’re deal- 
ing with. Being able to judge just 
how tnuch your opposite number 
wants something can be an advan- 
tage . The catch, of course, is 
that they have to learn each cul- 
ture’s non-verbal language; while 
being able to sense our emotions 
was a potential leg up, it was no 
more than a nuisance until they 
could correctly interpret a very con- 

77 




fusing welter of impressions. 

Part of my job was to teach one 
Perspe how to do that. On paper, it 
doesn’t sound like much, but it in- 
fused me with exuberant excite- 
ment. That excitement impelled me, 
supported me, kept me happy even 
during the early part when it was 
mostly just hard work. 

I'd get up around seven, shower, 
shave, and grab something to eat, 
and then start in on the tapes. For 
two or three hours I’d parrot 
pattern-sentences, as I tried to 
hammer them in — I was training 
myself to spit back Perspean re- 
sponses automatically, rather than 
having to assemble them word-by- 
word in my conscious mind. 

Then, at about ten in the morn- 
ing, the Perspe to whom I’d been 
assigned would enter my room to 
do the emotion drill. After plopping 
into his chair, he would slowly re- 
cite a list of emotions. “Love,” 
he’d say, and I’d try to feel love for 
someone or something. “Anger,” 
he’d order, and I’d cross to the 
window, breathe deeply, and de- 
spise all those who would pollute 
our air. “Boredom,” he’d call, and 
I’d look at him and laugh, because 
during those days, that was the one 
emotion I could not feel. 

In the afternoons, we’d mix the 
two languages up every which way. 
I’d speak in English and he’d an- 
swer in Perspean; after an hour we’d 
switch and do it the other way. 
Sometimes we’d stick to one lan- 
guage for a while, then switch to

bi-lingual. Every day I learned 
more; every day I came closer to 
fluency. He was a good teacher. 

I haven’t told you much about 
Rsark — that’s “my” Perspean’s 
name — because 1 don’t know how 
to make you understand him. I 
don’t really myself. A being’s mind 
is a microcosm of his culture, right? 
Rsark’s culture is so different from 
ours that to him the Polynesian and 
the Prussian seem one and the 
same. 

If I told you that Rsark was a 
spend-thrift cannibal who’d had a 
thousand females once but none 
twice, you wouldn’t think much of 
him, would you? But once you 
realized that his world doesn’t use 
money, that the cannibalism is a re- 
ligious obligation believed to confer 
immortality on the eaten and that 
it’s physically dangerous for males 
of his race to have sex with the 
same female twice, your opinion 
might change. But possibly not, be- 
cause you have been taught that 
certain beliefs are universal and 
absolute — that they hold true for 
off-world frogs, too. 

So instead of trying to describe 
Rsark, let me tell you what hap- 
pened the night the bellboy w^nt 
crazy. 

We were nearing the end of the 
language-learning phase and we 
were both feeling confident in our 
command of the other’s language. 
Since we were in the midst of an 
involved conversation utilizing a 
high degree of empathic projection 

GALAXY 




we decided to have dinner sent up 
to my room. 

Rsark was slouched in his chair, 
trying to sort out the component 
parts of my broadcast. His eyes 
were shut because it was easier to 
feel my vibrations when there was 
no interference from a different type 
of sensory input. “Not bad, 
Robert,” he commented. ‘‘But can 
you amplify the fear a little? 

“The problem with you,’’ he 
mused, ‘‘is that you’re not single- 
minded enough; you’re too intro- 
spective. You keep watching your- 
self behave, which adds an extra 
dimension of emotion. And once 
you start watching yourself watch 
yourself ...” His tongue flickered 
out as a mosquito hummed through 
the screenless window. “Give me a 
less self-conscious fear, Robert.” 

“I’ll try,” I agreed, getting to 
my feet to answer a knock at the 
door. As I walked over to the foyer 
I tried to cut out all emotions but 
fear. Once I’d swung the door 
open, I didn’t have to try any 
longer. At the other end of the 
room-service pushcart was a little 
man with wild eyes, a two-day 
beard and a pistol. 

“Beautiful purity, Robert,” 
called Rsark from around the comer. 
“That’s excellent, thank you. You 
can stop now.” 

I opened my mouth to say some- 
thing, but the gun moved forward 
and to the left. It wanted me to 
back into the sitting room. Slowly. 

I did. 

SHAHERED HOPES, BROKEN DREAMS 



“Robert,” said Rsark petulantly, 
“I told you to stop. You’re begin- 
ning to create a feedback effect.” 
The bellboy followed me in, us- 
ing the cart like a lion-tamer uses 
his chair. His left hand groped for 
the door and pushed it shut. His 
fingers found the bolt. It grated into 
place. At his gesture, I stepped 
backwards again, until I was stop- 
ped by the chair I had been sitting 
in. 

Rsark had risen to bitch about my 
stubbornness. A glance at the 
bellboy and his gun did nothing to 
change his mind. “Robert,” he 
demanded, reaching up to give my 
forearm a painful tweak, “enough 
fear! It’s starting to hurt!” 

“Sorry, Rsark,” I muttered, “but 
I can’t help it. You’re now tasting 
genuine fear — can’t you see this 
guy’s got a gun?” 

“Why, certainly,” he replied, 
sounding puzzled. “But what does 
that have to do with what you’re 
broadcasting?’ ’ 

I was nonplussed. A crazy- 
looking bellboy was aiming an ugly 
gun at my soft belly and Rsark 
didn’t see the relation between that 
and my fear. “Ah that’s better, 
Robert,” he commended me. 
“You’ve mixed in — don’t tell me, I 
should know by now — ah, exaspera- 
tion, right?” 

I just looked at him. 

“Oh, how subtle!” he purred. 
“You’ve dropped the fear, 
strengthened the exasperation, and 
stirred in . astonishment, is it?” 

79 




Before I could find the appro- 
priate words, the bellboy cut in. 
“Shaddup,” he growled, menacing 
Rsart with the gun. “Just siddown 
inna chair and shaddup.” 

The Perspe stood his ground. 
“Why?” My skin stopped tingling, 
so I knew he’d switched his data- 
gathering organs to the intruder. 

“I’m taking you two hostage,” 
said the bellboy, surprised into ex- 
planation by Rsark’s demeanor. 
“Buddy-boy — ” a careless wave of 
the gun indicated me “ — is gonna 
call the big boys, tell ’em I want a 
million bucks and a plane to Rio.” 
“But why should they give you 
that?” asked Rsark, with the inno- 
cent curiosity of one from a world 
where no crime had ever been 
committed for money. 

“ ’cause I got you two hostage,” 
grunted the bellboy. His bloodshot 
eyes flicked from me to Rsark and 
back, very neatly keeping us pin- 
ned. 

The Perspe’s eyes closed, and his 
small body tensed. “Robert!” he 
cried, “this man is amazing. He’s 
feeling more emotions at one time 
than you ever have! I sense fear, 
hunger, lust, confusion, hatred, re- 
pulsion . oh, what a collection! 
Thank you for bringing him, Robert. ’ ’ 
“I didn’t.” 

His eyelids opened like theater 
curtains. “You didn’t?” 

“No.” 

“Who did?” 

“He himself. He’s serious. 

“About what?” 

80 



“The money, you fucking frog!” 
shouted the bellboy. I think we’d 
hurt his feelings by ignoring him. 
“Froggie, you siddown inna chair. 
Now!” 

I threw in my two cents’ worth 
with a desperate, “Please, Rsark.” 

“Oh.” He gave what I’d learned 
was a Perspean shrug as he waddled 
back to his chair. “Robert, this is 
not a common means of gaining 
money, is it?” 

“No,” I answered as I moved to 
the telephone. “It isn’t.” Under the 
man’s watchful eye, I dialed down 
to the switchboard. 

“Is it . what’s the word 
. legal?” 

“Legal?” I laughed to prove my 
courage, but I didn’t really see any- 
thing funny. “No, Rsark, it’s not 
legal. Not at all.” 

“Well,” he asked thoughtfully, 
“if it’s not legal, why does he think 
he can get the money?” 

“Operator, get me the Secretary 
General of the U.N. Okay, I’ll 
wait — but it’s extremely important.” 
I looked back to Rsark, and sud- 
denly understood what a ping-pong 
ball feels like. “He will get the 
money, because if he doesn’t, he’ll 
kill us both.” 

“Oh.” After a moment’s consid- 
eration, he said to the bellboy, 
“Sir, you’d best reconsider. My or- 
ganization would resent my death.” 
To me, he added, “My fellow 
Perspe really couldn’t care less, but 
for some reason the Federation 
Government gets upset when we’re 

GALAXY 




killed in the line of duty. They say 
it’s an insult.” 

“Shaddup!” The bellboy turned 
to me. “Get ’im yet?” 

I shook my head and pressed the 
telephone to my ear. 

“Robert,” asked Rsark, flapping 
his hand to catch my attention, “do 
you think he really means it?” 

“Yes, Rsark,” I said as patiently 
as I could manage. 

“Is that why you feel so much 
fear?” 

“Yes, Rsark.” It was getting 
harder to be patient. 

“I wish I could understand you 
beings,” he complained. “Worry- 
ing all the time about death is not 
healthy. It blocks your synapses, 
you know. And mine, too, when I 
have to listen to you — and you’re 
both radiating so ferociously that I 
can’t do anything else.” 

“Well, I am very sorry, Rsark,” 

I said from between tightly-clenched 
teeth. “I would not be feeling fear 
if this — this — this madman weren’t 
pointing his damn gun at my heart. 
I’d feel a lot better if it were tomor- 
row already, and this whole thing 
was over.” 

“You Terrans,” he muttered with 
what I considered to be unjustifiable 
scorn. “If you weren’t driving me 
crazy with your undisciplined vibra- 
tions, I’d let you stew in this. Just 
to teach you a lesson.” 

“What?” I would have laughed 
if I hadn’t been so damn scared. “Do 
you think you can get us out of 
this?” 

SHAHERED HOPES, BROKEN DREAMS 



He nodded. I think he also tried 
to say, “That’s right,” but it didn’t 
come out too well — his tongue was 
stretched halfway across the floor, 
its tip burdened with the heavy 
hand-gun. I didn’t mind his being 
unintelligible at all. 

My jaw sagged almost to my 
chest. The bellboy’s, I noticed, had 
done the same; we must have 
looked like twins until I recovered 
and hit him with the telephone re- 
ceiver. It was metal, and luckily my 
wild swing connected with his right 
temple, and he went down like a 
felled tree. First I told the operator 
to forget the U.N. and to send the 
police up instead. Then I crossed 
the room and helped the maddening 
little diplomat untangle his tongue. 
My mistake. The first thing he said 
was, “So that’s what pure relief 
feels like.” Luckily for interstellar 
relations, the phone was back on 
the hook. 

★ ★ ★ 

Talks were to recommence at 
9:00 a.m. the next morning. Rsark 
had arranged it, because of the Dip- 
lomatic Corps’ solicitousness that 
evening following the attack. He 
took their syncophantic concern in 
stride, responded graciously to their 
queries, and waited till they had left 
before asking me, “Why are they 
afraid?” 

I looked up from the vocabulary 
list I was trying to memorize and 
scratched my head. “Are they 

81 




afraid?” I wasn’t a diplomat; I 
couldn’t guess at their emotions. 
They all wore masks. During the 
previous six months I’d found that 
diplomatic body language was usu- 
ally misleading and as often as not 
false. I suppose I should have re- 
membered that earlier in the eve- 
ning; every U.N. delegate who’d cal- 
led or visited had projected contrary 
feelings that I’d taken seriously. 
“They sure didn’t look that way to 
me.’’ 

“But they were afraid,” he in- 
sisted. “Each and every one of 
them. Why?’’ 

“Um,” I stalled, sliding the vo- 
cabulary list onto the coffee table be- 
cause I had an inkling that this 
might go longer than a round or 
two, “were they afraid the whole 
time?’’ 

The skin under his eyes wrinkled 
as he thought. On a Terran, it 
would have been a frown. “No,” 
he said slowly, “no, the pattern 
was high initial fear, a wave of re- 
lief shortly after w^ started talking, 
and then a recurrence of the fear. 
The second time around, it grew 
steadily, until at the end it was al- 
most as high as at the beginning.” 

Without really thinking about it, I 
got out of my chair and walked to 
the door. There I began to mimic 
the majority of the ambassadors, as 
I tried to force myself to feel what 
they had. “First fear, then relief, 
then growing fear again?” 

“Yes.” He stared at me curious- 
ly- 
82 



“Well . hey, what did their 
fear feel like?” I was exasperated 
with myself. There I was, discus- 
sing the cause of an emotion with 
one of the best emotion-readers in 
our part of the universe, and I 
hadn’t thought to have him describe 
the fear. “Did it feel like mine, 
when that maniac pulled his gun on 
us?” 

“No,” he said, shaking his head. 
“It didn’t. Similar, but not the 
same. Theirs felt like ... let me 
put it like this. You were afraid of 
losing your life. That set up a cer- 
tain hollow resonance, which I can 
easily recognize, now. But these 
men, while they resonated hollowly, 
did it in a slightly different way. 
They were afraid of losing some- 
thing, but I don’t know ...” 

I snapped my fingers. “Their 
careers!” 

He looked a question at me. 

“When they came in, they were^ 
afraid they’d find you angry enough 
to go home. That would make their 
governments super-pissed; they’d be 
in hot water, maybe even get fired, 
demoted — I don’t know. Then when 
they saw how unconcerned you 
were they were relieved. La- 
ter . oh, yeah — later they started 
thinking maybe you were going to 
get your revenge in some sneaky 
way — that’s the way they do things, 
how do they know you’re different? 
And the more they thought about it, 
the more scared they got.” 

Rsark’s head was bobbing up and 
down; my explanation must have 

GALAXY 




made sense to him. “You Terrans 
value your careers almost as much 
as your lives, don’t you?” 

“Yeah,” 1 agreed. Then 1 
thought of all the suicides the world 
has known. “Sometimes more.” 

Rsark looked surprised. From 
what he’d told me, I knew that a 
Peispe chooses a career much as we 
choose hobbies. To them, jobs are 
diversions, not occupations. 

“Rsaik,” I asked suddenly, “you 
can sense our emotions — but can 
you really share them? I mean, do 
you really know how horrible a Ter- 
ran can feel when he loses his 
job?” 

He studied the webbing between 
the fingers of his right hand. “On 
our world, Robert, the most impor- 
tant thing is knowledge. Or truth, if 
you prefer that word. Many of us 
devote our time to research, so that 
we can add to the knowledge of our 
race. The prestige attached to this 
spurs us on. And sometimes, in a 
... a fash desire to accumulate a 
lot of prestige quickly, some- 
one . .” his eyes turned to the 
open window, avoiding mine 
“. someone will offer a — what’s 
your^erm? — ’ ‘hypothesis’ as fact. 
From the moment he does that, he 
knows fear. Because one of two 
things will happen: the hypothesis 
may be verified, in which case he 
will be honored, or it may prove to 
be false, in which case he will be 
. ridiculed.” He fell silent for 
so long that I thought he’d finished, 
but just as I cqjened my mouth, he 

SHATTERED HOPES, BROKEN DREAMS 



went on: “1 think, Robert, that 1 
can interpret into my own frame of 
reference your fear of losing your 
job.” He said it so softly, so gent- 
ly, that 1 couldn’t probe. 1 picked 
up the vocabulary list, and went 
back to work. 

Fifteen or twenty minutes later, 
Rsark shook himself out of the 
mood that had enveloped him. 
Crossing the room to the telephone, 
he put a call through to his Chief of 
Mission. He was urging the Chief 
to start up negotiations again, even 
if they were futile; just to show us 
that there were no hard feelings. 

“Look, Rsark,” 1 said as 1 fol- 
lowed him into the back seat of the 
Cadillac limousine, “I don’t think I 
can interpret for you yet. I’m not 
ready. I’m not fluent enough yet.” 

He didn’t seem to hear me. I tap- 
ped his arm and started to repeat 
myself, but he waved an impatient 
hand. I shut up. “Robert,” he said, 
“the guard in our hallway, the one 
by the elevator — why was he 
afraid?” 

I frowned. Going to the coffee 
shop for a quick breakfast. I’d 
noticed the guard’s near-servility, 
but I hadn’t recognized it as a cloak 
for fear. I’d assumed that he’d got- 
ten orders to treat us extra-nicely, to 
make up for the night before. 
“What kind of fear?” 

“The same as the ambassadors 
felt last night.” 

“Oh, Jesus.” I sank into the up- 
holstery and laughed. “Rsark, 
you’re incredible, you know? Here 

83 




you can sniff out fear at twenty 
paces, but you can’t figure out why 
it exists.” 

“Terran psychology is frustrat- 
ing,” he grumped. “And I’ve only 
been here nine months. You can’t 
expect me to — ” 

“That’s okay,” 1 said, patting his 
leathery shoulder in mock condo- 
lence. “I know we don’t make 
sense to you. But listen — remember 
why the ambassadors were scared?” 

“Sure.” 

“Can’t you see that he’s afraid 
for the same reason?” 

“But it wasn’t his fault that the 
bellboy went crazy!” 

“Of course not, but it was his 
fault that a nut with a gun got into 
our room, right?” 

“I suppose that to your race,” he 
sighed, “it might seem so.” 

“It is.” 

His solemn eyes blinked twice. 
Finally, he muttered, “I will talk to 
his superior. I don’t want him 
punished.” After that, he lapsed 
into uncommunicativeness. 

* -k It 

Actually the day wasn’t difficult. 
The eighteen of us filled one side of 
a long table, in a Perspe/student, 
Perspe/student arrangement. Oppo- 
site us, the U.N. negotiating team 
sat tense and wary. Separating the 
two sides was a portable computer, 
which did the bulk of the transla- 
tion. 

Our role was simple, especially 

84 



since the U.N. had dispensed with 
simultaneous interpretation to help 
us. We’d listen to a speech in Pers- 
pean, then compare our understand- 
ing of it with the computer’s En- 
glish version. If we thought it had 
erred, we broke in. 

To someone who speaks only one 
language, that may seem impossi- 
ble, after only six months of study. 
It’s not, really. We weren’t translat- 
ing from our native languages into 
Perspean; we were merely checking 
the accuracy of the translation from 
Perspean into English. Anyone who 
has learned a foreign language 
comprehends far more than he 
speaks. Even people who speak 
only one language understand a 
tremendous number of words that 
they themselves not only do not 
use, but cannot use. Encountering a 
word in its proper context makes an 
amazing difference. 

I didn’t get a chance to do much 
the first day. One of the Eastern 
bloc linguists scored first, when the 
computer tried to translate “Rev- 
olutionary” as “rebel”. Later, one 
of the children — the scary little 
genius from Vienna, if I remember 
correctly — convinced us that Tsoklo 
ga h’ malk was a Perspean idiom 
meaning “intimates of the de- 
ceased” and not “necrophiliacs”. 

“We couldn’t understand your 
revulsion at giving priority passage 
to Tsoklo ga h’malk,” whispered 
Rsark, behind the fan he’d made of 
his right hand. “What the hell’s 
that ‘necro-’ word mean, anyway?” 

GALAXY 




“Later, Rsark,*’ I mumbled 
back. 

The Perspe did the same thing, 
but from the opposite direction. 
This created a problem. As it turned 
out, each of us had accustomed 
“his” Perspe to the colloquial form 
of his language. Evidently, Pers- 
pean had no formal/informal 
dichotomy, as Terran languages do, 
so the Perspe had assumed that our 
daily language would be utilized in 
the negotiations. Their consternation 
when the first delegate let loose 
with full-blown diplomatese was 
something to behold . also 
somewhat of an embarrassment. 

“But I can’t understand him,” 
protested Rsark in a ■tow aside. 

“I don’t follow him too well my- 
self,” I admitted. 

“But this is ridiculous!” 

So 1 was pushed onto center 
stage, for a moment or two, at 
least. “Mr. Ambassador,” 1 said as 
1 cleared my throat, “please pard6n 
my interruption, but there’s a com- 
munication problem.” He flushed 
with indignation. 

The other Perspe, having heard 
my remarks put into their tongue by 
the computer, and having seen 
Rsark ’s reassuring nod verify the 
translation, rumbled general agree- 
ment. The delegates were upset. 
They resisted my suggestion that 
they skip the formalities. “Mr. 
Schelly,” explained one, “diploma- 
tic language is extremely precise. It 
may sound overly formal to you, 
but I assure you, sir a definite 

SHAHERED HOPES, BROKEN DREAMS 



meaning is attached to each and ev- 
ery word. We speak the way we do 
to avoid possible misunderstand- 
ings. Yet you want us to abandon 
this precision?” 

“Well, yeah,” I said, squirming 
under his hostile gaze. “See, Rsark 
speaks English, and so does, uh — ” 
one of the Perspe obligingly waved 
a pencil at me “ — Tnad over there, 
but they don’t speak your kind. 
They can't speak your kind. It 
would have taken too much time to 
learn. So, if you all could just sort 
of drop back into colloquial. ?” 

Finally, the diplomats consented. 
They had no other choice. Either 
they spoke in ways familiar to the 
Perspe, or the talks were delayed 
again. “But,” argued one last-ditch 
defender of formality, “this way 
will take so much longer! We’ll 
have to define the implications and 
connotations of every word in the 
final draft!” 

“It’s still quicker,’’ I pointed 
out, “than waiting for Rsark to 
learn your brand of English.” He 
was displeased at my impertinence, 
but he subsided into inaudible 
grumblings peppered with dire 
looks. 

The rest of the conference — that 
is, until the final draft of the treaty 
between Earth and the galactic or- 
ganization had been drawn up — 
went fairly well, although it was a 
little dull. 

Once everyone understood 
everyone else, it took less than a 
month to get the rules of interstellar 

85 




travel into language dll Terrans 
could understand. It might have tak- 
eff longer if our representatives 
could have had an option other than 
simple acceptance, resembling a bar- 
gaining chip, they were forced to 
agree to everything. On the last 
day, everyone initialed twenty or 
thirty copies of the draft, and left 
New York to get it ratified by his 
government. 

^ * 

“Robert,” said Rsark, on the day 
after the General Assembly had ap- 
proved the treaty, “since there’s noth- 
ing left for me to do officially. I’d 
like to become a tourist. I’ve seen 
nothing but this city. Would it be 
possible to — ” 

“Sure!” I was getting sick of 
New York, too. Too damn big, too 
impersonal. Unlike most Midwest- 
erners in Fun City, I hadn’t wor- 
ried about getting mugged — one of 
the nicer aspects of a full-time se- 
curity guard — but I was fed up with 
concrete, steel, and tinted glass. 
“Where do you want to go first?” 
“It’s your world, Robert.” 

“Well ... do you want to see 
natural beauty, or human artifacts? 
Do you crave solitude or crowds? 
What do you want?” 

He leaned back in his chair and 
thought for a while. After snacking 
on a wandering bee, he suggested, 
“Could we study this society? I’d 
like to observe how your country- 
men . oh, how they work, how 

86 



they live, how they amuse them- 
selves. That sort of thing.” 

“No sooner said than done,” I 
beamed. That was my chance. Be- 
cause of the language training and 
the negotiations I hadn’t seen a 
single Browns’ game that season — 
and my home-town team had gotten 
to the play-offs; the Conference 
Champsionship with San Diego was 
scheduled for the following Sunday, 
in Cleveland’s Memorial Stadium. 
“How’d you like to go to a foot- 
ball game?” 

“Football?” He frowned briefly, 
and my heart sank. 

“Yeah — you know, that game I 
was watching on television last 
week?” 

“Oh, that!” he said with startling 
enthusiasm. “That was very in- 
teresting. Yes, I’d like to see it. 
Tnad would, too.” 

The telephone leaped into my 
hand. In less than a minute I had 
begged an old high school friend, a 
sportswriter for the Cleveland 
Press, for tickets to the game. The 
phone was well away from my ear 
while he expostulated. I sipped at a 
cup of coffee until he ran out of 
steam. “Needless to say, Harry,” I 
added in my best diplomatic man- 
ner, “we’ll give you an exclusive 
interview after the game. Won’t 
your readers be interested in the 
reactions of the first extraterrestrials 
ever to attend an NFL game?” I 
waited for ten seconds of dead air 
to slide by. “Thanks, Harry. I’ll 
drop by your house on Sunday 

GALAXY 




morning to pick up the tickets. I’ll 
even pay you for them.” Chuck- 
ling, I returned the receiver to its 
cradle. ‘‘Well, Rsark, looks like 
you and Tnad are going to make 
history.” 

it * -k 

A December day in Cleveland is 
rarely Mother Nature’s finest mo- 
ment, but on this occasion she re- 
lented, bestowing a blue sky and a 
light lake breeze on more than 

86.000 fans. The temperature was 
in the mid-thirties, but snug inside 
my heavy coat and with the sun on 
my face, I was warm, comfortable 
and very happy. 

The stadium was so crowded that 
we could barely move, which is 
saying a lot for a place with about 

83.00 seats. After we’d found ours, 

I unpacked my binoculars and scan- 
ned our general vicinity. ‘‘Good,” I 
commented to Rsark, ‘‘not many 
Charger fans.” 

‘‘Huh?” 

‘‘Most of the people here,” I 
explained patiently, ‘‘are from 
Cleveland. They want the Browns 
to win today, so they’re called 
Brown fans. Those who want San 
Diego to win are called Charger 
fans. See, there’s one over there.” I 
was about to hand him the binocu- 
lars when I realized that they would 
never fit his eyes. ‘‘Well, down 
there, where that pennant is. It says 
San Diego on it.” 

‘‘I see it. It looks very lonely, all

by itself. Why did they come, when 
everyone else wants the Browns to 
win?” 

I shrugged; I myself have never 
understood that kind of support. ‘‘I 
guess they really want to watch the 
game, so they came even though 
they knew they’d be outnumbered 
1000 to one. I’ll bet they don’t 
cheer very loudly, though.” 

‘‘Not likely,” Rsark agreed. 

Then some little kids approached 
us, stopping about five feet from the 
Perspean. Rsark motioned the guard 
not to chase them away. With eyes 
almost as big and round as his they 
stared for what seemed like fifteen 
minutes. Finally the smallest of 
them walked right up to him. 

‘‘Hey, mister,” he asked in an 

87 




awestruck tone, “you one of them 
Per-spee?” 

“Perspe,” corrected Rsark gent- 
ly. The kid was drawn tight as a 
piano wire; the alien diplomat tried 
to relax him. “Yes, I am.” 

“Ain’t you cold?” The little boy 
stamped his feet, as if to show 
Rsark how to warm himself. 

“No,” he replied seriously, still 
trying to quiet the kid’s nerves. 
“I’m wearing a space-suit, and that 
keeps me warm.” 

I hadn’t thought the wide- 
stretched brown eyes could get big- 
ger, but they did. “Really?” 

' “Uh-huh.” He tapped the silver 
belt that encircled his waist. “See? 
This controls it.” 

The boy’s interest was finally 
caught. His fear vanished; “I don’t 
see no space- suit!” 

“That’s because it’s almost invis- 
ible. It’s a force field, and it can’t 
be seen against my skin. But wait a 
minute.” He held his hand up in 
the air and spread his fingers. 
“Look at it against the sky. See 
around the edges?” A minute 
flicker of light outlined each of his 
fingers. “That’s the force field right 
there.” 

“And it really keeps you warm, 
huh?” 

“That it does.” 

“Hey, Willie,” one of his friends 
hissed, “the teams’re cornin’ out 
now. Let’s go!” There was no 
doubt in his mind, at least, as to the 
relative importance of alien dip- 
lomats and the Cleveland Browns. 
88 



With perfunctory waves the little 
pack disappeared into the crowd. 

“Nice boy,” said Rsark as he 
leaned back in his seat. 

“Pretty brave, too,” I suggested, 
“to come right up and talk to you 
that way.” 

“Well,” he shrugged, “if he’d 
gone up to ugly old Tnad over 
there, then I’d agree with you. 
But — ” he modestly cast his eyes 
down “ — I’m so much handsomer 
than he is that I don’t frighten little 
children.” 

The other diplomat pretended not 
to have heard, and since the teams 
were lining up for the kick-off, I 
decided that I would, too. “The 
team on the right is Cleveland, the 
one on the left is San Diego. The 
Chargers will start the game by 
kicking to the Browns.” 

“Why?” 

“Uh, a few minutes ago, they 
flipped a coin to see who’d receive 
first.” I saw Rsark had drawn a 
blank. “Random chance determines 
who will kick.” He nodded. The 
whistle blew and the game was on. 

* * 

If it had happened in the second 
half, or even late in the first, it 
wouldn’t have mattered; we would 
have left by then. 

After the kick-off, we didn’t try 
to say anything further. It was too 
noisy; 86,000 cheering people can 
drown out a lot of conversation — 
and the Browns were giving the 
crowd cause to shout. 



GALAXY 




The quarterback, a second-year 
man out of Oklahoma, had led the 
Browns to a 12-1-1 season. He had 
a healthy body, an arm ^lowerful 
enough to rifle the ball sixty yards, 
a computer brain, and the ability to 
inspire a team. 

That last was Jack Smeriglio’s 
most important asset. When he was 
on the field, the Browns were a dev- 
astating machine, uncontrollable 
and invulnerable. When he went off 
something happened to the other 
parts of the machine. It was as if 
they climbed down from a dream, 
awoke to the realization that they 
had been playing way over their 
heads . When Smeriglio went to 
the bench, he left behind eleven in- 
dividuals, not a team. 

But he was in, and the Browns 
were tearing up the Chargers. The 
first play from scrimmage lifted the 
spectators out of their seats. On first 
and ten at his own twenty, he audi- 
bled. Then his running-back took it 
on a draw and got eighteen twist- 
ing, clawing yards. First and ten on 
the thirty-eight. Another audible. 
The tight end cut across the forty- 
five and found the ball buried in his 
gut. He got six more yards before 
being dumped. First down on the 
Charger forty-nine. No audible. 
Heavy rush, but Smeriglio ducked 
out from under two angry be- 
hemoths and put a perfect spiral 
into the hands of his wide receiver, 
who hurtled out of bounds on the 
Charger eight-yard line. 

“Robert,” Rsark bellowed into 

SHAHERED HOPES, BROKEN DREAMS 



my ear, “I am getting uneasy. 
There is too much emotion here; it 
is setting up feedback in me. I imag- 
ine Tnad is feeling the same 
thing. Can we leave?” 

The crowd-noise was so deafen- 
ing that I wasn’t quite sure of 
what he’d said. Whipping out a 
notebook, I scribbled, “Can’t hear 
you,” on the first page. I handed it 
to him, and watched Smeriglio take 
his time getting downfield. He cut 
an impressive figure as he strode 
through the cheers that rocked the 
massive stadium. 

Rsark wrote, then held the 
notebook before my eyes; I read his 
request and shrugged. 1 hated to 
leave, but in a situation like that I 
couldn’t think of myself. “Okay,” 
I wrote beneath his elegant script, 
“we’ll leave after the next play.” 

He read it, and patted me on the 
knee to let me know that was ok. I 
circled the last line, and passed it 
down to Tnad. He shot me a grate- 
ful glance. Greg Cohen, Tnad’s 
student/tutor didn’t, but I could 
hardly blame him for that. 

Then Smeriglio brought the team 
out of the huddle, looked around, 
and started to bark out his signals. 
The stadium was going crazy. 
Everywhere you looked, people 
were on their feet, waving their 
arms, shouting for all they were 
worth. Smeriglio started to call for 
silence. His hands rose to his 
shoulders, then he dropped forward 
to his knees. Obligingly, everyone 
hushed, except for the people in the 

89 





left-end zone, the ones who were 
facing him. They kept on screaming. 

In the relative silence, the second 
shot was shockingly loud. Smeriglio 
toppled to his face. When the center 
rolled him over, every person pres- 
ent could see the gaping hole the 
dum-dum bullets had left in his 
chest. For one or two heartbeats, 
the 86,000 people in Memorial 
Stadium were more silent than a 
snowy mountaintop. I heard only 
two sounds — a rising wind, and 
Tnad’s moan. 

“Quick,” commanded Rsark, 
tugging at my sleeve, “you must 
get us out of here. The emotion, 
it’s—” 

“Greg!” I was on my feet with 
the Perspe curled in my arms. 
“Grab Tnad! Let’s go!” 

90 



The crowds were impossible. 
Understandably so. I was operating 
at full speed, where each second 
dragged by like a minute. They 
were in normal time, and annoyed 
that we cut off their view of the 
field. Yet I went down twelve steps 
in three leaps, all the while balanc- 
ing Rsark most carefully. “Get outa 
my way!” I shouted as I floated 
through the air, so agonizingly 
slowly that I had time to notice the 
squad of trainers rushing out to the 
fallen quarterback. “Emergency 
case here, move it, move it!” 

I had just turned the comer when 
a rumble like an avalanche began. 
Ahead loomed the maze of run- 
ways, catwalks, and ramps that led 
to the outside. I poured it on, put- 
ting into the sprint every ounce of 
power my legs possessed. The con- 
crete drifted beneath me like river 
water under a raft. Two more 
bounds. Cohen was close behind 
me; the security guards were lost in 
the crowd. The rumble broke into a 
full-throated roar of anger and frus- 
tration and hatred. Rsark responded 
with such a terrible noise that while 
I waited for my left foot to touch, I 
sent tip a prayer to God, asking 
Him to quiet my friend. An instant 
later, after Rsark had gone quiet but 
frighteningly stiff, I re- worded the 
prayer. Then he was writhing in my 
arms, nearly fighting free of my 
grip, and a third plea rose to 
Heaven. 

Then, far in the distance, high 
above all the other monstrous noises 



GALAXY 




coming from the brilliantly-lighted 
stadium came a silvery shriek of 
agony that surely marked the end of 
someone’s life. And my friend 
Rsark went limp. And died. 

★ ★ ★ 

That’s about all there was to it. I 
spoke to Rsark’s superior and 
explained what had happened. He 
regretted the untimely loss of two of 
his assistants, but he was a Perspe. 
“Everyone must die,’’ he comforted 
me, “and the manner of death is 
not important. What matters is 
whether one had been happy or not. 
Rsark and Tnad led lives full of 
joy. Long lives, with much joy. I 
am glad that they tasted pleasure so 
frequently.’’ 

But he was a Perspe. His bosses, 
the beings who run the galactic or- 
ganization that had sent Rsark and 
his colleagues to Earth, were not. 
They looked at the matter from a 
completely different angle. “To 
them,” the wistful Ambassador told 
the emergency session of the Gen- 
eral Assembly, “Rsark and Tnad 
died at the hands of an angry mob. 

I told them that it was both acciden- 
tal and extraordinary. They said that 
if you Terrans can keep your hands 
from hurling stones, you should be 
able to keep your minds from hurl- 
ing hate. I regret to inform you that 
we must disavow the recently- 
signed treaty. 

The remainder of the Perspe mis- 
sion left the next morning. The 

SHAHERED HOPES, BROKEN DREAMS 




warships took up a tight orbit 
around Earth the following day. 
They’re there now, blockading us, 
keeping us crawling on a planet that 
seems very cramped. No one knows 
when they’ll consent to talk again. 
That’s my new job. Every day, for 
eight hours, I sit at a microphone. 
In halting Perspean, I beg the be- 
ings to understand us, to talk to us, 
to . forgive us. 

Sometimes, on nights when the 
wind has swept the clouds and the 
smog into someone else’s sky, I 
look up at the haughty stars and 
wonder whether he was a terrified 
reactionary, afraid to let the world 
live with suddenly infinite horizons, 
or whether he was only a mad, des- 
perate football fan. Not that it mat- 
ters much. ★

V^OLLABORATIONS ARE UNNATUR- 
AL. The writer is a jealous god. He 
builds his universe without interfer- 
ence. He resents the carping of 
mentally deficient critics and the 
editor’s capricious demands for re- 
visions. Let two writers try to make 
one universe, and their defenses get 
in the way. 

But. Our fields of expertise 
matched each the other’s blind 
spots, unnaturally well. There were 
books neither of us could write 
alone. We had to try it. 

At first we were too polite, too 
reluctant to criticize each other’s 
work. That may have saved us from 
killing each other early on, but it 
left flaws that had to be tom out of 
the book later. 

We had to build the worlds. 
From Motie physiognomy we had to 
build Motie technology and history 
and life styles. Niven had to be 
coached in the basic history of 
Pournelle’s thousand-year-old in- 
terstellar culture. 



It took us three years. At the end 
we had a novel of 245,000 words 
. .which was too long. We cut it 
to 170,000, to the reader’s great 
benefit. We cut 20,000 words off 
the beginning, including in one 
lump our first couple of montlis of 
work: a Prologue, a battle between 
spacegoing warcraft, and .a prison 
camp scene. All of the crucial in- 
formation had to be embedded in la- 
ter sections. 

We give that Prologue here. 
When the Moties and the Empire 
and the star systems and their 
technologies and philosophies had 
become one interrelated whole, this 
is how it looked from New 
Caledonia system. We called it 

MOTELIGHT 

Last night at this time he had gone 
out to look at the stars. Instead a glare 
of white light like an exploding sun 
had met him at the door, and when he 
could see again a flaming mushroom 



93 




was rising from the cornfields at the 
edge of the black hemisphere roofing 
the University. Then had come sound, 
rumbling, rolling across the fields to 
shake the house. 

Alice had run out in terror, desper- 
ate to have her worst fears confirmed, 
crying, “What are you learning that’s 
worth getting us all killed?” 

He’d dismissed her question as typi- 
cal of an astronomer’s wife, but in fact 
he was learning nothing. The main 
telescope controls were erratic, and 
nothing could be done, for the telescope 
itself was on New Scotland’s tiny 
moon. These nights interplanetary 
space rippled with the strange lights of 
war, and the atmosphere glowed with 
ionization from shock waves, beamed 
radiation, fusion explosions. .He had 
gone back inside without answering. 

Now, late in the evening of New 
Scotland’s 27 hour day, Thaddeus Pot- 
ter, Ph.D., strolled out into the night 
air. 

It was a good night for seeing. In- 
terplanetary war could play hell with 
the seeing; but tonight the bombard- 
ment from New Ireland had ceased. 
The Imperial Navy had won a victory. 

Potter had paid no attention to the 
newscasts; still, he appreciated the vic- 
tory’s effects. Perhaps tonight the war 
wouldn’t interfere with his work. He 
walked thirty paces forward and turned 
just where the roof of his house 
wouldn’t block the Coal Sack. It was a 
sight he never tired of. 

The Coal Sack was a nebular mass 
of gas and duri, small as such things 
go — eight to ten parsecs thick — but 
dense, and close enough to New 
Caledonia to block a quarter of the 
sky. Earth lay somewhere on the other 
side of it, and so did the Imperial Cap- 
ital, Sparta, both forever invisible. The 

94 



Coal Sack hid most of the Empire, but 
it made a fine velvet backdrop for two 
close, brilliant stars. 

And one of them had changed dras- 
tically. 

Potter’s face changed too. His eyes 
bugged. His lantern jaw hung loose on 
its hinges. Stupidly he stared at the sky 
as if seeing it for the first time. 

Then, abruptly, he ran into the 
house. 

Alice came into the bedroom as he 
was phong Edwards. “What’s hap- 
pened?” she cried. “Have they pierced 
the shield?” 

“No,” Potter snapped over his 
shoulder. Then, grudgingly, “Some- 
thing’s happened to the Mote.” 

“Oh for God’s sake!” She was 
genuinely angry. Potter saw. All that 
fuss about a star, with civilization fall- 
ing around our ears! But Alice had no 
love of the stars. 

Edwards answered. On the screen he 
showed naked from the waist up, his 
long curly hair a tangled bird’s nest. 
“Who the hell-? Thad. I might have 
known. Thad, do you know what time 
it is?” 

“Yes. Go outside,” Potter ordered. 
“Have a look at the Mote. ” 

“The Mote? The Mote?” 

“Yes. It’s gone nova!” Potter 
shouted. Edwards growled, then sud- 
den comprehension struck. He left the 
screen without hanging up. Potter 
reached out to dial the bedroom win- 
dow transparent. And it was still there. 

Even without the Coal Sack for 
backdrop Murcheson’s Eye would be 
the brightest object in the sky. At its 
rising the Coal Sack resembled the 
silhouette of a hooded man, head and 
shoulders; and the off-centered red 
supergiant became a watchful, malevo- 
lent eye. The University itself had be- 

GALAXY 




gun as an observatory funded to study 
the supergiant. 

This eye had a mote: a yellow dwarf 
companion, smaller and dimmer, and 
uninteresting. The Universe held plenty 
of yellow dwarfs. 

But tonight the Mote was a brilliant 
blue-green point. It was almost as 
bright as Murcheson’s Eye itself, and 
it burned with a purer light. Murche- 
son’s Eye was white with a strong red 
tinge; but the Mote was bluegreen with 
no compromise, impossibly green. 

Edwards came back to the phone. 
“Thad, that’s no nova. It’s lilx noth- 
ing ever recorded. Thad, we’ve got to 
get to the observatory!” 

“I know. I’ll meet you there.” 

‘7 want to do spectroscopy on it.” 

•‘All right.” 

“God, I hope the seeing holds! Do 
you think we’ll be able to get through 
today?” 

‘‘If you hang up, we’ll find out 
sooner.” 

‘‘What? Och, aye.” Edwards hung 
up. 

* * * 

The bombardment started as Potter 
was boarding his bike. There was a hot 
streak of light like a very large shoot- 
ing star; and it didn’t burn out, but 
reached all the way to the horizon. 
Stratospheric clouds formed and van- 
ished, outlining the shock wave. Light 
glared on the horizon, then faded 
gradually. 

“Damn,” muttered Potter, with feel- 
ing. He started the motor. The war 
was no concern of his, except that he 
no longer had New Irish students. He 
even missed some of them. There was 
one chap from Cohane who: . 

A cluster of stars streaked down in 
exploding fireworks. Something burned 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



like a new star overhead. The falling 
stars winked out, but the other light 
went on and on, changing colors 
rapidly, even while the shock wave 
clouds dissipated. Then the night be- 
came clear, and Potter saw that it was 
on the moon. 

What could New Ireland be shooting 
at on New Scotland’s moon? 

Potter understood then. “You bas- 
tards!” he screamed at the sky. “You 
lousy traitor bastards!” 

The single light reddened. 

He stormed around the side of Ed- 
wards’ house shouting, “The traitors 
bombed the main telescope! Did you 
see it? All our work — oh.” 

He had forgotten Edwards’ backyard 
telescope. 

It had cost him plenty, and it was 
very good, although it weighed only 
four kilograms. It was portable — 
“Especially,” Edwards used to say, 
“when compared with the main tele- 
scope. ” 

He had brought it because the 
fourth attempt at grinding his own 
mirror produced another cracked disk 
and an ultimatium from his now dead 
wife about Number 200 Carbo grains 
tracked onto her New-Life carpets. 

Now Edwards moved away from the 
eyepiece saying, “Nothing much to see 
there.” He was right. There were no 
features. Potter saw only a uniform 
aquamarine field. 

“But have a look at this,” said Ed- 
wards. “Move back a bit. ..” He set 
beneath the eyepiece a large sheet of 
white paper, then a wedge of clear 
quartz. 

The prism spread a fan-shaped rain- 
bow across the paper. But the rainbow 
was almost too dim to see, vanishing 
beside a single line of aquamarine; 
and that line blazed. 



95 




“One line," said Potter. “Mono- 
chromatic?” 

“I told you yon was no nova.” 

“Too right it wasn’t. But what is it? 
Laser light? It has to be artificial! 
Lord, what a technology they’ve 
buiU!” 

“Och, come now.” Edwards inter- 
rupted the monologue. “I doubt yon’s 
artificial at all. Too intense.” His 
voice was cheerful. “We’re seeing 
something new. Somehow yon Mote is 
generating coherent light. ” 

“I don’t believe it.” 

Edwards looked annoyed. After all, 
it was his telescope. “What think you, 
then? Some booby calling for help? If 
they were that powerful, they would 
send a ship. A ship would come thirty- 
five years sooner!” 

“But there’s no tramline from the 
Mote to New Caledonia! Not even 
theoretically possible. Only link to the 
Mote has to start inside the Eye. 
Murcheson looked for it, you know, 
but he never found it. The Mote’s 
alone out there. ” 

“Och, then how could there be a 
colony?” Edwards demanded in 
triumph. “Be reasonable, Thad! We 
hae a new natural phenomenon, 
something new in stellar proccess.” 
“But if someone \s calling — ” 

“Let’s hope not. We could no help 
them. We couldn’t reach them, even if 
we knew the links! There’s no starship 
in the New Cal system, and there’s no 
likely to be until the war’s over.” Ed- 
wards looked up at the sky. The moon 
was- a small, irregular half-disk; and a 
circular crater still burned red in the 
dark half. 

A brilliant violent streak flamed high 
overhead. The violet light grew more 
intense and flared white, then van- 
ished. A warship had died out there. 

96 



“Ah, well,” Edwards said. His voice 
softened. “If someone’s calling he 
picked a hell of a time for it. But at 
least we can search for modulations. If 
the beam is no modulated, you’ll admit 
there’s nobody there, will you not?” 

“Of course,” said Potter. 

•k ir it 

In 2862 there were no starships be- 
hind the Coal Sack. On the other side, 
around Crucis and the Capital, a tiny 
fleet still rode the force paths between 
stars to the worlds Sparta controlled. 
There were fewer loyal ships and 
worlds each year. 

The summer of 2862 was lean for 
New Scotland. Day after day a few 
men crept outside the black dome that 
defended the city; but they always re- 
turned at night. Few saw the rising of 
the Coal Sack. 

It climbed weirdly, its resemblance 
to a shrouded human silhouette marred 
by the festive two-colored eye. The 
Mote burned as brightly as Murche- 
son’s Eye now. But who would listen 
to Potter and Edwards and their crazy 
tales about the Mote? The night sky 
was a battlefield, dangerous to look 
upon. 

The war was not really fought for 
the Empire now. In the New Caledonia 
system the war continued because it 
would not end. Loyalist and Rebel 
were meaningless terms; but it hardly 
mattered while bombs and wrecked 
ships fell from the skies. 

Henry Morrissey was still head of 
the University Astronomy Department. 
He tried to talk Potter and Edwards 
into returning to the protection of the 
Langston Field. His only success was 
that Potter sent his wife and two sons 
back with Morrissey. Edwards had no 



GALAXY 




living dependents, and both refused to 
budge. 

Morrissey was willing to believe that 
something had happened to the Mote, 
but not that it was visible to the naked 
eye. Potter was known for his 
monomaniacal enthusiasms. 

The Department could supply them 
with equipment. It was makeshift, but 
it should have done the job. There was 
laser light coming from the Mote. It 
came with terrific force, and must have 
required terrific power, and enormous 
sophistication to build that power. No 
one would build such a thing except to 
send a message. 

And there was no message. The 
beam was not modulated. It did not 
change color, or blink off and on, or 
change in intensity. It was a steady, 
beautifully pure, terribly intense 
beam of coherent light. 

Potter watched to see if it might 
change silhouette, staring for hours 
into the telescope. Edwards was no 
help at all. He alternated between po- 
lite gloating at having proved his point, 
and impolite words muttered as he 
tried to investigate the new “stellar 
process” with inadequate equipment. 
The only thing they agreed on was the 
need to publish their observations, and 
the impossibility of doing so. 

One night a missile exploded against 
the edge of the black dome. The 
Langston Field protecting University 
City could only absorb so much energy 
before radiating inward, vaporizing the 
town, and it took time to dissipate the 
hellish fury poured into it. Frantic en- 
gineers worked to radiate away the 
shield energy before the generators 
melted to slag. 

They succeeded, but there was a 
burn-through: a generator left yellow- 
hot and runny. A relay snapped open, 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



and New Caledonia stood undefended 
against a hostile sky. Before the Navy 
could restore the Field a million people 
had watched the rising of the Coal 
Sack. 

“I came to apologize,” Morrissey 
told Potter the next morning. “Some- 
thing damned strange has happened to 
the Mote. What have you got?” 

He listened to Potter and Edwards, 
and he stopped their fight. Now that 
they had an audience they almost came 
to blows. Morrissey promised them 
more equipment and retreated under 
the restored shield. He had been an as- 
tronomer in his time. Somehow he got 
them what they needed. 

Weeks became months. The war 
continued, wearing New Scotland 
down, exhausting her resources. Potter 
and Edwards worked on, learning 
nothing, fighting with each other and 
screaming curses at the New Irish 
traitors. 

They might as well have stayed un- 
der the shield. The Mote produced 
coherent light of amazing purity. Four 
months after it began the light Jumped 
in intensity and stayed that way. Five 
months later it Jumped again. 

It Jumped once more, four months 
later, but Potter and Edwards didn’t 
see it. That was the night a ship from 
New Ireland fell from the sky, its 
shield blazing violet with friction. It 
was low when the shield overloaded 
and collapsed, releasing stored energy 
in one ferocious blast. 

Gammas and photons washed across 
the plains beyond the city, and Potter 
and Edwards were carried into the 
University hospital by worried students. 
Potter died three days later. Edwards 
walked for the rest of his life with a 
backpack attached to his shoulders: a 
portable life support system.

It was 2870 on every world where 
clocks still ran when the miracle came 
to New Scotland. 

An interstellar trading ship, long 
converted for war and recently dam- 
aged, fell into the system with her 
Langston Field intact and her hold 
filled with torpedoes. She was killed in 
the final battle, but the insurrection on 
New Ireland died as well. Now all the 
New Caledonia system was loyal to the 
Empire; and the Empire no longer 
existed. 

The University came out from under 
the shield. Some had forgotten that the 
Mote had once been a small yellow- 
white point. Most didn’t care. There 
was a world to be tamed, and that 
world had been bare rock terraformed 
in the first place. The fragile imported 
biosphere was nearly destroyed, and it 
took all their ingenuity and work to 
keep New Scotland inhabitable. 

They succeeded because they had to. 
There were no ships to take survivors 
anywhere else. The Yards had been de- 
stroyed in the war, and there would be 
no more interstellar craft. They were 
alone behind the Coal Sack. 

The Mote continued to grow brighter 
as the years passed. Soon it was more 
brilliant than the Eye; but there were 
no astronomers on New Scotland to 
care. In 2891 the Coal Sack was a 
black silhouette of a hooded man. It 
had one terribly bright blue-green eye, 
with a red fleck in it. 

★ * * 

One night at the rising of the Coal 
Sack, a farmer named Howard Grote 
Littlemead was struck with inspiration. 
It came to him that the Coal Sack was 




God, and that he ought to tell some- 
one. 

Tradition had it that the Face of 
God could be seen from New 
Caledonia; and Littlemead had a pow- 
erful voice. Despite the opposition of 
the Imperial Orthodox Church, despite 
the protests of the Viceroy and the 
scorn of the University staff, the 
Church of Him spread until it was a 
power of New Scotland. 

It was never large, but its members 
were fanatics; and they had the mira- 
cle of the Mote, which no scientist 
could explain. By 2895 the Church of 



98 



GALAXY 



Him was a power among New Scot 
farmers, but not in the cities. Still, 
half the population worked in the 
fields. The converter kitchens had all 
broken down. 

By 2900 New Scotland had two 
working irUerplanetary spacecraft, one 
of which could not land. Its Langston 
Field had died. The term was appro- 
priate. When a piece of Empire technol- 
ogy stopped working, it was dead. It 
could not be repaired. New Scotland 
was becoming primitive. 

For forty years the Mote had grown. 
Children refused to believe that it had 
once been called the Mote. Adults 
knew it was true, but couldn’t re- 
' member why. They called the twin 
stars Murcheson’s Eye, and believed 
that the red supergiant had no special 
name. 

The records might have showed dif- 
ferently, but the University records 
were suspect. The Libarary had been 
scrambled by electromagnetic pulses 
during the years of siege. It had large 
areas of amnesia. 

In 2902 the Mote went out. 

Its green light dimmed to nothing 
over a period of several hours; but that 
happened on the other side of the 
world. When the Coal Sack rose above 
University City that night, it rose as a 
blinded man. 

All but a few remnants of the 
Church of Him died that year. With 
the aid of a handful of sleeping pills 
Howard Grote Littlemead hastened to 
meet his God. .possibly to demand an 
explanation. 

Astronomy also died. There were few 
enough astronomers and fewer tools; 
and when nobody could explain the 
vanishing of the Mote. .and when 
telescopes turned on the Mote’s rem- 
nant showed only a yellow dwarf 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



star, with nothing remarkable about it 
at all. 

People stopped considering the stars. 
They had a world to save. 

The Mote was a G-2 yellow dwarf, 
thirty-five lightyears distant; a white 
point at the edge of Murcheson’s Eye. 
So it was for more than a century, 
while the Second Empire rose from 
Sparta and came again to New 
Caledonia. 

Then astronomers read old and in- 
complete records, and resumed their 
study of the red supergiant known as 
Murcheson’s Eye; but they hardly 
noticed the Mote. 

And the Mote did nothing unusual 
for one hundred and fifteen years. 

* * * 

Thirty-five light years away, the 
aliens of Mote Prime had launched 
a light-sail spacecraft, using bat- 
teries of laser cannon powerful 
enough to outshine a neighboring 
red supergiant. 

As for why they did it that way, 
and why it looked like that, and 
what the bejeesus is going 
on. .explanations follow.

]W[oST HARD SCIENCE FICTION 
writers follow standard rules for 
building worlds. We have formulae 
and tables for getting the orbits 
right, selecting suns of proper 
brightness, determining tempera- 
tures and climates, building a plau- 
sible ecology. Building worlds re- 
quires imagination, but a lot of the 
work is mechanical. Once the 
mechanical work is done the world 
may suggest a story, or it may even 

99 




design its own inhabitants. Larry 
Niven’s “known space” stories in- 
clude worlds which have strongly 
affected their colonists. 

Or the exceptions to the rules 
may form stories. Why does Mote 
Prime, a nominally Earthlike world, 
remind so many people of the 
planet Mars? What strangeness in 
its evolution made the atmosphere 
so helium-rich? This goes beyond 
mechanics. 

In THE MOTE IN GOD’S EYE 
(Simon and Schuster, 1974) we 
built not only worlds, but cultures. 

From the start MOTE was to be a 
novel of first contact. After our ini- 
tial story conference we had larger 
ambitions: MOTE would be, if we 
could write it, the epitome of first 
contact novels. We intended to 
explore every important problem 
arising from first contact with 
aliens — and to look at those prob- 
lems from both human and alien 
viewpoints. 

That meant creating cultures in 
far more detail than is needed for 
most novels. It’s easy, when a 
novel is heavy with detail, for the 
details to get out of hand, creating 
glaring inconsistencies. (If civiliza- 
tion uses hydrogen fusion power at 
such a rate that world sea level has 
dropped by two feet, you will not 
have people sleeping in abandoned 
movie houses.) To avoid such in- 
consistencies we worked a great 
deal harder developing the basic 
technologies of both the Motie 
(alien) and the human civilizations. 

100 



In fact, when we finished the 
book we had nearly as much unpub- 
lished material as ended up in the 
book. There are many pages of data 
on Motie biology and evolutionary 
history; details on Empire science 
and technology; descriptions of 
space battles, how worlds are ter- 
raformed, how light-sails are con- 
structed; and although these 
background details affected the 
novel and dictated what we would 
actually write, most of them never 
appear in the book. 

We made several boundary deci- 
sions. One was to employ the Sec- 
ond Empire period of Pournelle’s 
future history. That Empire existed 
as a series of sketches with a loose 
outline of its history, most of it 
previously published. MOTE had to 
be consistent with the published 
material. 

Another parameter was the physi- 
cal description of the aliens. Incred- 
ibly, that’s all we began with: a de- 
tailed description of what became 
the prototype Motie, the Engineer: 
an attempt to build a nonsymmetri- 
cal alien, left over from a Niven 
story that never quite jelled. The 
history, biology, evolution, sociolo- 
gy, and culture of the Modes were 
extrapolated from that being’s shape 
during endless coffee-and-brandy 
sessions. 

That was our second forced 
choice. The Moties lived within the 
heart of the Empire, but had never 
been discovered. A simple explana- 
tion might have been to make the

aliens a young civilization just dis- 
covering space travel, but that as- 
sumption contradicted Motie history 
as extrapolated from their appear- 
ance. We found another explanation 
in the nature of the Alderson drive, 
discussed later. 

Because Mote has not yet ap- 
peared in paperback, many Galaxy 
readers will not have read it yet; 
and further discussion of the Moties 
would spoil the book for them. 

Perhaps in a couple of years we’ll 
do another article on the history and 
background of the Moties; Heaven 
knows we have enough data in our 
notebooks. On the other hand, we 
may just hang onto it for the 
sequels, if any. 

EMPIRE TECHNOLOGY 

The most important technological 
features of the Empire were previ- 
ously published in other stories: the 
Alderson Drive and Langston Field. 

Both were invented to Jerry 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Pournelle’s specifications by Dan 
Alderson, a resident genius at Cal 
Tech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratories. 
It had always been obvious that the 
Drive and Field would affect the 
cultures that used them, but until 
we got to work on MOTE it wasn’t 
obvious just how profound the ef- 
fects would be. 

The Alderson Drive 

Every sf writer eventually must 
face the problem of interstellar 
transportation. There are a number 
of approaches. One is to deny 
faster-than-light travel. This in prac- 
tice forbids organized interstellar 
civilizations. 

A second approach is to ignore 
General and Special Relativity. 
Readers usually won’t accept this. 
It’s a cop-out, and except in the 
kind of story that’s more allegory 
than science fiction, it’s not appro- 
priate. 

Another method is to retreat into 



doubletalk about hyperspace. Dou- 
bletalk drives are common enough. 
The problem is that when every- 
thing is permitted, nothing is for- 
bidden. Good stories are made 
when there are difficulties to over- 
come, and if there are no limits to 
“hyperspace travel” there are no 
real limits to what the heroes and 
villains can do. In a single work the 
“difficulties” can be planned as the 
story goes along, and the drive then 
redesigned in rewrite; but we 
couldn’t do that here. 

Our method was to work out the 
Drive in detail and live with the re- 
sulting limitations. As it happens, 
the limits on the Drive influenced 
the final outcome of the story; but 
they were not invented for that pur- 
pose. 

The Alderson Drive is consistent 
with everything presently known 
about physics. It merely assumes 
that additional discoveries will be 
made in about thirty years, at Cal 
Tech (as a tip o’ the hat to Dan Al- 
derson). The key event is the detec- 
tion of a “fifth force”'. 

There are four known forces in 
modern physics; two sub-nuclear 
forces responsible respectively for 
alpha and beta decay; electromag- 
netism, which includes light; and 
gravity. The Alderson force, then, 
is the fifth, and it is generated by 
thermonuclear reactions. 

The force has little effect in our 
universe; in fact, it is barely detect- 
able. Simultaneously with the dis- 
covery of the fifth force, however, 

102 



we postulate the discovery of a sec- 
ond universe in point-to-point con- 
gruence with our own. The “con- 
tinuum universe” differs from the 
one we’re used to in that there are 
no known quantum effects there. 

Within that universe particles 
may travel as fast as they can be 
accelerated; and the fifth force 
exists to accelerate them. 

There’s a lot more, including a 
page or so of differential equations, 
but that’s the general idea. 

You can get from one universe to 
another. For every construct in our 
universe there can be created a 
“correspondence particle” in the 
continuum universe. In order for 
your construct to go into and 
emerge from the continuum uni- 
verse without change you must have 
some complex machinery to hold 
everything together and prevent 
your ship — and crew — from being 
disorganized into elementary parti- 
cles. 

Correspondence particles can be 
boosted to speeds faster than light: 
in fact, to speeds nearly infinite as 
we measure them. Of course they 
cannot emerge into our universe at 
such speeds: they have to lose their 
energy to emerge at all. More on 
that in a moment. 

There are severe conditions to en- 
tering and leaving the continuum 
universe. To emerge from the con- 
tinuum universe you must exit with 
precisely the same potential energy 
(measured in terms of the fifth 
force, not gravity) as you entered. 

GALAXY 




You must also have zero kinetic 
energy relative to a complex set of 
coordinates, that we won’t discuss 
here. 

The fifth force is created by 
thermonuclear reactions: generally, 
that is, in stars. You may travel by 
using it, but only along precisely 
defined lines of equipotential flux: 
tramways or tramlines. 

Imagine the universe as a thin 
rubber sheet, very flat. Now drop 
heavy rocks of different weights 
onto it. The rocks will distort the 
sheet, making little cone-shaped 
(more or less) dimples. Now put 
two rocks reasonably close together: 
the dimples will intersect in a val- 
ley. The intersection will have a 
“pass”, a region higher than the 
low points where the rocks (stars) 
lie, but lower than the general level 
of the rubber sheet. 

The route from one star to 
another through that “pass” is the 
tramline. Possible tramlines lie be- 
tween each two stars, but they don’t 
always exist, because when you add 
third and fourth stars to the system 
they may interfere, so there is no 
unique gradient line. If this seems 
confusing, don’t spend a lot of time 
worrying about it; we’ll get to the 
effects of all this in a moment. 

You may also imagine stars to be 
like hills; move another star close 
and the hills will intersect. Again, 
from summit to summit there will 
be one and only one line that pre- 
serves the maximum potential energy 
for that level. Release a marble on 




one .hill and it will roll down, 
across the saddle, and up the side of 
the other. That too is a tramline ef- 
fect. It’s generally easier to think of 
the system as valleys rather than 
hills, because to travel from star to 
star you have to get over that 
“hump” between the two. The fifth 
force provides the energy for that. 

You enter from the quantum uni- 
verse. When you travel in the con- 
tinuum universe you continually 
lose kinetic energy; it “leaks”. This 
can be detected in our universe as 
photons. The effect can be impor- 
tant during a space battle. We cut 
such a space battle from MOTE, 
but it still exists, and we may yet 
publish it as a novella. 

To get from the quantum to the 
continuum universe you must sup- 
ply power, and this is available only 
in quantum terms. When you do 
this you turn yourself into a corres- 
pondence particle; go across the 
tramline; and come out at the point 
on the other side where your poten- 
tial energy is equal to what you en- 
tered with, plus zero kinetic energy 

103 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



(in terms of the fifth force and 
complex reference axes). 

For those bored by the last few 
paragraphs, take heart: we’ll leave 
the technjcal details and get on with 
what it all means. 

ir it * 

Travel by Alderson Drive consists 
of getting to the proper Alderson 
Point and turning on the Drive. 
Energy is used. You vanish, to 
reappear in an immeasurably short 
time at the Alderson Point in 
another star system some several 
light years away. If you haven’t 
done everything right, or aren’t at 
the Alderson Point, you turn on 
your drive and a lot of energy van- 
ishes. You don’t move. (In fact you 
do move, but you instantaneously 
reappear in the spot where you 
started.) 

That’s all there is to the Drive, 
but it dictates the structure of an in- 
terstellar civilization. 

To begin with, the Drive works 
only from point to point across in- 
terstellar distances. Once in a star 
system you must rely on reaction 
drives to get around. There’s no 
magic way from, say, Saturn to 
Earth: you’ve got to slog across. 

Thus space battles are possible, 
and you can’t escape battle by van- 
ishing into hyperspace, as you could 
in future history series such as 
Beam Piper’s and Gordon 
Dickson’s. To reach a given planet 
you must travel across its stellar 

104 



system, and you must enter that sys- 
tem at one of the Alderson Points. 
There won’t be more than five or 
six possible points of entry, and 
there may only be one. 

Star systems and planets can be 
thought of as continents and islands, 
then, and Alderson Points as narrow 
sea gates such as Suez, Gibraltar, 
Panama, Malay Straits, etc. To 
carry the analogy further, there’s 
telegraph but no radio: the fastest 
message between star systems is 
one carried by a ship, but within 
star systems messages go much fas- 
ter than the ships. 

Hmm. This sounds a bit like the 
early days of steam. NOT sail; the 
ships require fuel and sophisticated 
repair facilities. They won’t pull 
into some deserted star system and 
rebuild themselves unless they’ve 
carried the spare parts along. How- 
ever, if you think of naval actions 
in the pteriod between the Crimean 
War and World War One, you’ll 
have a fair picture of conditions as 
implied by the Alderson Drive. 

The Drive’s limits mean that un- 
interesting stellar systems won’t be 
explored. There are too many of 
them. They may be used as 
crossing-points if the stars are con- 
veniently placed, but stars not along 
a travel route may never be visited. 

Reaching the Mote, or leaving it, 
would be damned inconvenient. Its 
only tramline reaches to a star only 
a third of a light year away — 
Murcheson’s Eye, the red 
supergiant — and ends deep inside 

GALAXY 




the red-hot outer envelope. The 
aliens’ only access to the Empire is 
across thirty-five light years of in- 
terstellar space — which no Empire 
ship would ever see. The gaps be- 
tween the stars are as mysterious 
to the Empire as they are to you. 

# # 

Langston Field 

Our second key technological 
building block was the Langston 
Field, which absorbs and stores 
energy in proportion to the fourth 
power of incoming particle energy: 
that is, a slow-moving object can 
penetrate it, but the faster it’s mov- 
ing (or hotter it is) the more readily 
it is absorbed. 

(In fact it’s not a simple fourth- 
power equation; but Galaxy 
readers surely don’t need third-order 
differential equations for amuse- 
ment.) 

The Field can be used for protec- 
tion against lasers, thermonuclear 
weapons, and nearly anything else. 
It isn’t a perfect defense, however. 
The natural shape of the Field is a 
solid. Thus it wants to collapse and 
vaporize everything inside it. It 
takes energy to maintain a hole in- 
side the Field, and more energy to 
open a control in it so that you can 
cause it selectively to radiate away 
stored energy. You don’t get some- 
thing for nothing. 

This means that if a Field is over- 
loaded, the ship inside vanishes into 
vapor. In addition, parts of the 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Field can be momentarily over- 
loaded: a sufficiently high energy 
impacting a small enough area will 
cause a temporary Field collapse, 
and a burst of energy penetrates to 
the inside. This can damage a ship 
without destroying it. 

Cosmography 

We’ve got to invent a term. What 
is a good word to mean the equiva- 
lent of “geography” as projected 
into interstellar space? True, 
planetologists have now adopted 
“geology” to mean geophysical 
sciences applied to any planet, not 
merely Earth; and one might 
reasonably expect “geography” to 
be applied to the study of physical 
features of other planets — but we’re 
concerned here with the relationship 
of star systems to each other. 

We suggest cosmography, but 
perhaps that’s too broad? Should 
that term be used for relationships 
of galaxies, and mere star system 
patterns be studied as “astrog- 
raphy”? After all, “astrogator” is a 
widely used term meaning 
“navigator” for interstellar flight. 

Some of the astrography of 
MOTE was given because it had 
been previously published. In par- 
ticular, the New Caledonia system, 
and the red supergiant known as 
Murcheson’s Eye, had already been 
worked out. There were also pub- 
lished references to the history of 
New Caledonia. 

We needed a red supergiant in 
the Empire. There’s only one logi- 

105 




cal place for that, and previously 
published stories had placed one 
there: Murcheson’s Eye, behind the 
Coal Sack. It has to be behind the 
Coal Sack: if there were a super- 
giant that close anywhere else, we’d 
see it now. 

Since we had to use Murcheson’s 
Eye, we had to use New Caledonia. 
Not that this was any great imposi- 
tion: New Scotland and New Ireland 
are interesting places, terraformed 
planets, with interesting features 
and interesting cultures. 

There was one problem, though: 
New Scotland is inhabited by New 
Scots, a people who have preserved 
their sub-culture for a long time and 
defend it proudly. Thus, since much 
of the action takes place on New 
Scotland, some of the characters, 
including at least one major charac- 
ter, had to be New Scot. For struc- 
tural reasons we had only two 
choices: the First Officer or the 
Chief Engineer. 

We chose the Chief Engineer, 
largely because in the contemporary 
world it is a fact that a vastly dis- 
proportionate number of ship’s en- 
gineers are Scots, and that seemed a 
reasonable thing to project into the 
future. 

Alas, some critics have resented 
that, and a few have accused us of 
stealing Mr. Sinclair from Star 
Trek. We didn’t. Mr. Sinclair is 
what he is for perfectly sound as- 
trographical reasons. 

The astrography eventually dic- 
tated the title of the book. Since 

106 



most of the action takes place very 
near the Coal Sack, we needed to 
know how the Coal Sack would 
look close up from the back side. 
Eventually we put swirls of in- 
terplanetary dust in it, and evolving 
proto-stars, and all manner of mar- 
vels; but those came after we got 
very close. The first problem was 
the Coal Sack seen from ten par- 
secs. 

Larry Niven hit on the happy im- 
age of a hooded man, with the 
super-giant where one eye might be. 
The supergiant has a small compan- 
ion, a yellow dwarf not very differ- 
ent from our Sun. If the supergiant 
is an eye — Murcheson’s Eye — then 
the dwarf is, of course, a mote in 
that eye. 

But if the Hooded Man is seen by 
backward and superstitious peoples 
as the Face of God. .then the 
name for the Mote becomes inevita- 
ble. .and once suggested. The 
“Mote In God’s Eye’’ is a near irre- 
sistible title. (Although in fact Larry 
Niven did resist it, and wanted 
“The Mote In Murcheson’s Eye’’ 
up to the moment when the pub- 
lisher argued strongly for the pres- 
ent title. .) 

The Ships 

Long ago we acquired a commer- 
cial model called “The Explorer 
Ship Lief Ericson,’’ a plastic space- 
ship of intriguing design. It is 
shaped something like a flattened 
pint whiskey bottle with a long 
neck. The “Lief Ericson,” alas, 

GALAXY 




was killed by general lack of in- 
terest in spacecraft by model 
buyers; a ghost of it is still mar- 
keted in hideous glow-in-the-dark 
color as some kind of flying saucer.' 

It’s often easier to take a detailed 
construct and work within its limits 
than it is to have too much flexibili- 
ty. For fun we tried to make the 
Lief Ericson work as a model for an 
Empire naval vessel. The exercise 
proved instructive. 

First, the model is of a big ship, 
and is of the wrong shape ever to 
be carried aboard another vessel. 
Second, it had fins, only useful for 
atmosphere flight: what purpose 
would be served in having atmo- 
sphere capabilities on a large ship? 

This dictated the class of ship: it 
must be a cruiser or battlecruiser. 
Battleships and dreadnaughts 
wouldn’t ever land, and would be 
cylindrical or spherical to reduce 
surface area. Our ship was too large 
to be a destroyer (an expendable 
ship almost never employed on mis- 
sions except as part of a flotilla). 
Cruisers and battlecruisers can be 
sent on independent missions. 

MacArthur, a General Class 
Battlecruiser, began to emerge. She 
can enter atmosphere, but rarely 
does so, except when long indepen- 
dent assignments force her to seek 
fuel on her own. She can do this in 
either of two ways: go to a supply 
source, or fly into the hydrogen-rich 
atmosphere of a gas giant and 
scoop. There were scoops on the 
model, as it happens. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



She has a large pair of doors in 
her hull, and a spacious compart- 
ment inside: obviously a hangar 
deck for carrying auxiliary craft. 
Hangar deck is also the only large 
compartment in her, and therefore 
would be the normal place of as- 
sembly for the crew when she isn’t 
under battle conditions. 

The tower on the model looked 
useless, and was almost ignored, 
until it occurred to us that on long 
missions not under acceleration it 
would be useful to have a high- 
gravity area. The ship is a bit thin 
to have much gravity in the “neck” 
without spinning her far more 
rapidly than you’d like; but with the 
tower, the forward area gets normal 
gravity without excessive spin rates. 

And on, and so forth. In the 
novel, Lenin was designed from 
scratch; and of course we did have 
to make some modifications in Lief 
Ericson before she could become 
INSS MacArthur; but it’s surprising 
just how much detail you can work 
up through having to live with the 
limits of a model. 

SOCIOLOGY 

The Alderson Drive and the 
Langston Field determine what 
kinds of interstellar organizations 
will be possible. There will be al- 
ternatives, but they have to fit into 
the limits these technologies im- 
pose. 

In THE MOTE IN GOD’S EYE 
we chose Imperial Aristocracy as 
the main form of human govern- 



107 




ment. We’ve been praised for this: 
Dick Brass in a New York Post re- 
view concludes that we couldn’t 
have chosen anything else, and 
other critics have applauded us for 
showing what such a society might 
be like. 

Fortunately there are no Sacred 
Cows in science fiction. Maybe we 
should have stuck to incest? Be- 
cause other critics have been hor- 
rified! Do we, they ask, really be- 
lieve in imperial government? and 
monarchy? 

That depends on what they mean 
by “believe in”. Do we think it’s 
desirable? We don’t have to say. 
Inevitable? Of course not. Do we 
think it’s possible? Damn straight. 

The political science in MOTE is 
taken from C. Northcote Parkin- 
son’s Evolution of Political 
Thought. Parkinson himself echoes 
Aristotle. 

It is fashionable to view history 
as a linear progression; things get 
better, never worse, and of course 
we’ll never go back to the bad old 
days of (for instance) personal gov- 
ernment. Oddly enough, even critics 
who have complained about the 
aristocratic pyramid in MOTE — and 
thus rejected our Empire as 
absurd — have been heard to com- 
plain about “Imperial Presidency” in 
the USA. How many readers would 
bet long odds against John-John 
Kennedy becoming President within 
our lifetimes? 

Any pretended “science” of his- 
tory is the bunk. That’s the problem 

108 



with Marxism. Yet Marx wrote a 
reasonable economic view of history 
up to his time, and some of his 
principles may be valid. 

Military history is another valid 
way to view the last several 
thousand years — but no one in his 
right mind would pretend that a his- 
tory of battles and strategies is the 
whole of the human story. You may 
write history in terms of medical 
science, in terms of rats, lice, and 
plagues, in terms of agricultural de- 
velopment, in terms of strong lead- 
ership personalities, and each view 
will hold some truth. 

There are many ways to view his- 
tory, and Aristotle’s cycles as 
brought up to date by Parkinson 
make one of the better ones. For 
those who don’t accept that proposi- 
tion, we urge you at least to read 
Parkinson before making up your 
minds and closing the door. 

The human society in MOTE is 
colored by technology and historial 
evolution. In MOTE’s future history 
the United States and the Soviet 
Union form an alliance and together 
dominate the world during the last 
decades of the 20th Century. The 
alliance doesn’t end their rivalry, 
and doesn’t make the rulers or 
people of either nation love their 
partners. 

The CoDominium Alliance needs 
a military force. Military people 
need something or someone they 
can give loyalty; few men ever 
risked their lives for a “standard of 
living” and there’s little that’s more 



GALAXY 




stupid than dying for one’s standard 
of living — unless it’s dying for 
someone else’s standard of living. 

Do the attitudes of contemporary 
police and soldiers lead us to sup- 
pose that “democracy” or “the 
people” inspire loyalty? The prop- 
osition is at least open to question, 
in the future that leads to MOTE, a 
Russian Admiral named Lermontov 
becomes leader of CoDominium 
forces, although he is not himself 
interested in founding a dynasty, he 
transfers the loyalty of the Fleet to 
leaders who are. 

He brings with him the military 
people at a time of great crisis. 
Crises have often produced strong 
loyalties to single leaders: Chur- 
chill, Roosevelt, George Washing- 
ton, John F. Kennedy during the 
Cuban Crisis, etc. (A year after 
Kennedy’s death Senator Pastore 
could address a national conven- 
tion and get standing ovations with 
the words “There stood John 
Kennedy, TEN FEET TALL!!!”) 

Thus develops the Empire. 

Look at another trend; personal 
dictatorship. There are as many 
people ruled by tyrants as by 
“democracy” in 1975, and even in 
the democracies charges of tyranny 
are not lacking. Dictatorships may 
not be the wave of the future — but 
is it unreasonable to suppose they 
might be? 

Dictatorship is often tried in 
times of severe crisis: energy crisis, 
population crisis, pollution crisis, 
agricultural crisis — surely we do not 



lack for crises? The trouble with 
dictatorship is that it generates a 
succession crisis when the old man 
bows out. Portugal seems to be go- 
ing through such at this moment. 
Chile, Uganda, Brazil, name your 
own examples: anyone want to bet 
that some of these won’t turn to a 
new Caudillo with relief? 

How to avoid succession crisis? 
One traditional method is to turn 
Bonapartist: give the job to a rela- 
tive or descendent of the dictator. 
He may not do the job very well, 
but after enough crises people are 
often uninterested in whether the 
land is governed well. They just 
want things settled so they can get 
on with everyday life. 

Suppose the dictator’s son does 
govern well? A new dynasty is 
founded, and the trappings of 
legitimacy are thrust onto the new 
royal family. To be sure, the title of 
“King” may be abandoned. Napo- 
leon chose to be “Emperor of the 
French”, Cromwell chose “Lord 
Protector”, and we suppose the US 
will be ruled by Presidents for a 
long time— but the nature of the 
Presidency, and the way one gets 
the office, may change. 

See, for example, Niven’s use of 
“Secretary-General” in the tales of 
Svetz the time-traveller. 

We had a choice in MOTE: to 
keep the titles as well as the struc- 
ture of aristocratic empire, or aban- 
don the titles and retain the struc- 
ture only. We could haye abolished 
“Emperor” in favor of “Presi- 

109 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 




dent”, or “Chairperson”, or 
“Leader”, or “Admiral”, or “Pos- 
nitch”. The latter, by the way, is 
the name of a particularly important 
President honored for all time by 
having his name adopted as the title 
for Leader. 

We might have employed titles 
other than Duke (originally meant 
“leader” anyway) and Count 
(Companion to the king) and Mar- 
quis (Count of the frontier march- 
es). Perhaps we should have. But 
any titles used would have been 
translations of whatever was current 
in the time of the novel, and the 
traditional titles had the effect of 
letting the reader know quickly the 
approximate status and some of the 
duties of the characters. 

There are hints all through 
MOTE that the structure of gov- 
ernment is not a mere carbon copy 
of the British Empire or Rome or 
England in the time of William III. 
On the other hand there are 
similarities, which are forced onto 
the Empire by the technology we 
assumed. 

Imperial government is not in- 
evitable. It is possible. 

The alternate proposition is that 
we of 1975 are so advanced that we 
will never go back to the bad old 
days. Yet we can show you essays 
“proving” exactly that proposi- 
tion — and written thousands of years 
ago. There’s a flurry of them 
every few centuries. 

We aren’t the first people to think 
we’ve “gone beyond” personal 

no 



government, personal loyalties, and 
a state religion. Maybe we won’t be 
the last. 

Anyway, MOTE is supposed to 
be entertainment, not an essay on 
the influence of science on social 
organization. (You’re getting that 
here.) 

The Empire is what it is largely 
because of the Alderson Drive and 
Langston Field. Without the Drive 
an Empire could not form. Certainly 
an interstellar Empire would look 
very different if it had to depend on 
lightspeed messages to send direc- 
tives and receive reports. Punitive 
expeditions would be nearly im- 
possible, hideously expensive, and 
probably futile: you’d be punishing 
the grandchildren of a generation 
that seceded from the Empire, or 
even a planet that put down the 
traitors after the message went out. 

Even a rescue expedition might 
never reach a colony in trouble. A 
coalition of bureaucrats could al- 
ways collect the funds for such an 
expedition, sign papers certifying 
that the ships are on the way, and 
pocket the money. .in sixty years 
someone might realize what had 
happened, or not. 

The Langston Field is crucial to 
the Empire, too. The Navy can sur- 
vive partial destruction and keep 
fighting. Ships carry black 
boxes — plug-in sets of spare 
parts — and large crews who have 
little to do unless half of them get 
killed. That’s much like the navies 
of fifty years ago. 



GALAXY 





A merchant ship might have a 
crew of forty. A warship of similar 
size carries a crew ten times as 
large. Most have little to do for 
most of the life of the ship. It’s 
only in battles that the large number 
of self-programming computers be- 
come important. Then the outcome 
of the battle may depend on having 
the largest and best-trained crew — 
and there aren’t many prizes for 
second place in battle. 

Big crews with little to do de- 
mand an organization geared to that 
kind of activity. Navies have been 
doing that for a long time, and have 
evolved a structure that they tena- 
ciously hold onto. 

Without the Field as defense 
against lasers and nuclear weapons, 
battles would become no more than 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



offensive contests. They’d last mi- 
croseconds, not hours. Ships would 
be destroyed or not, but hardly ever 
wounded. Crews would tend to be 
small, ships would be different, in- 
cluding something like the present- 
day aircraft carriers. Thus technol- 
ogy dictates Naval organization. 

It dictates politics, too. If you 
can’t get the populace, or a large 
part of it, under a city-sized Field, 
then any given planet lies naked to 
space. 

If the Drive allowed ships to 
sneak up on planets, materializing 
without warning out of hyperspace, 
there could be no Empire even with 
the Field. There’d be no Empire be- 
cause belonging to an Empire 
wouldn’t protect you. Instead there 
might be populations of planet- 

111 




bound serfs ruled at random by suc- 
cessive hordes of space pirates. 
Upward mobility in society would 
consist of getting your own ship and 
turning pirate. 

Given Drive and Field, though, 
Empires are possible. What’s more 
likely? A representative confedera- 
cy? It would hardly inspire the loy- 
alty of the military forces, whatever 
else it might do. (In the War Be- 
tween the States, the Confederacy’s 
main problem was that the troops 
were loyal to their own State, not 
the central government.) 

Each stellar system independent? 
That’s reasonable, but is it stable? 
Surely there might be pressures to- 
ward unification of at least parts of 
interstellar space. 

How has unification been 
achieved in the past? Nearly always 
by conquest or colonization or both. 
How have they been held together? 
Nearly always by loyalty to a 
leader, an Emperor, or a dynasty, 
generally buttressed by the trappings 
of religion and piety. Even 
Freethinkers of the last century 
weren’t ashamed to profess loyalty 
to the Widow of Windsor. 

Government over large areas 
needs emotional ties. It also needs 
stability. Government by 50%- 
plus-one hasn’t enjoyed particularly 
stable politics — and it lasts only so 
long as the 50%-minus-one minority 
is willing to submit. Is heredity a 
rational way to choose leaders? It 
has this in its favor: the leader is 
known from an early age to be des- 

112 



tined to rule, and can be educated 
to the job. Is that preferable to edu- 
cation based on how to get the job? 
Are elected officials better at gov- 
erning, or at winning elections? 

Well, at least the counter-case 
can be made. That’s all we intended 
to do. We chose a stage of Empire 
in which the aristocracy was young 
and growing and dynamic, rather 
than static and decadent; when the 
aristocrats are more concerned with 
duty than with privilege; and we 
made no hint that we thought that 
stage would last forever. 

RANDOM DETAILS 

Robert Heinlein once wrote that 
the best way to give the flavor of 
the future is to drop in, without 
warning, some strange detail. He 
gives as an example, “The door di- 
lated.’’ 

We have a number of such details 
in MOTE. We won’t spoil the book 
by dragging them all out in a row. 
One of the most obvious we use is 
the personal computer, which not 
only does computations, but also 
puts the owner in contact with any 
near-by data bank; in effect it will 
give the answer to any question 
whose answer is known and that 
you think to ask. 

Thus no idiot block gimmicks in 
MOTE. Our characters may fail to 
guess something, or not put infor- 
mation together in the right way, 
but they won’t forget anything im- 
portant. The closest that comes to 
happening is when Sally Fowler 

GALAXY 




can’t quite remember where she 
filed the tape of a conversation, and 
she doesn’t take long to find it then. 

On the other hand, people can be 
swamped with too much informa- 
tion, and that does happen. 

There were many other details, 
all needed to keep the story mov- 
ing. A rational kind of space suit, 
certainly different from the clumsy 
^hings used now. Personal weapons. 
The crystal used in a banquet 
aboard MacArthur: crystal strong as 
steel, cut from the windshield of a 
wrecked First Empire reentry vehi- 
cle, indicating the higher technology 
lost in that particular war. Clothing 
and fashion; the status of women; 
myriads of details of everyday life. 

Not that all of these differ from 
the present. Some of the things we 
kept the same probably will change 
in a thousand years. Others. .well, 
the customs associated with wines 
and hard liquors are old and stable. 
If we’d changed everything, and 
made an attempt to portray every 
detail of our thousand-year- 
advanced future, the story would 
have gotten bogged down in details.

MOTE is probably the only novel 
ever to have a planet’s orbit 
changed to save a line. 

New Chicago, as it appeared in 
the opening scenes of the first draft 
of MOTE, was a cold place, orbit- 
ing far from its star. It was never a 
very important point, and Larry Ni- 
ven didn’t even notice it. 



Thus when he introduced Lady 
Sandra Liddell Leonovna Bright 
Fowler, he used as viewpoint 
character a Marine guard sweating 
in hot sunlight. The Marine thinks, 
“She doesn’t sweat. She was 
carved from ice by the finest 
sculptor that ever lived.” 

Now that’s a good line. Unfortu- 
nately it implies a hot planet. If the 
line must be kept, the planet must 
be moved. 

So Jerry Pournelle moved it. New 
Chicago became a world much 
closer to a cooler sun. Its year 
changed, its climate changed, its 
whole history had to be changed. 

Worth it, though. Sometimes it’s 
easier to build new worlds than 
think up good lines. ★

Foots and children have 
angels to look after them — 
with politicians the case 
is slightly different. 



In the fullness of their separate 
being uneasiness pervades the Rin. 
Anxiety swells, resolves into ever- 
intensifying awareness of the 
wretched desolation of insularity; 
the call for oneness wells from the 
abyss of Rin being. In the thrall of 
Convocation, the Rin proceed to ini- 
tiate transmutation of their indi- 
vidual selves into the Aggregate 
clans. 

Each Founder-Rin radiates iden- 
tity and all others are. drawn to the 
closest Fouruier. 

One rather small Rin encounters 
an immediate obstacle. Though the 
Convocation tugs at his essence the 
Rin contains no desire to damage 
the barricade made by a Tender of 
the Smallest Friends. The little Rin 
does not wish to offend the Smallest' 
Friends. Inching along the inside of 
the circular obstruction, the Rin 
seeks an opening. Following the lit- 
tle Rin — at an appropriately re- 
spectful distance — is the Tender. 

Completing the circle and finding 
no opening, the Rin settles to the 
ground. .perhaps if the Rin 
politely — oh, so very politely!- 
requests it of the Smallest Friends 
on the other side of the barricade 
they will instruct their Tender to 
make an opening. 



Convocation tears at his essence 
and despair permeates the lonely 
Rin; no Smallest Friend has ever 
deigned to communicate with any 
Rin. But perhaps the smallest 
Friends though they remain silent 
as ever do understand, for suddenly 
the Tender moves swiftly to make an 
opening! Gratefully, the little Rin 
squinches through the space, exert- 
ing great care to cause no damage. 

On the other side stretches a 
great expanse of the Smallest 
Friends. Gently and carefully, the 
little Rin (who is little only for a 
Rin) hoists his bulk through them. 

Beyond the impassive, motionless 
Friends, the Rin flattens out and 
heeds the all-powerful call. No 
other hindrance slows his passage 
to the ultimate destiny of all Rin. 

Despite the initial delay, the little 
Rin is one of the first to reach a 
Founder. So close. Convocation is 
overwhelming and the little Rin 
yields up all selfhood to the elder 
being. Individual identity fades. The 
little Rin is melding into unity with 
the Founder. 

In his final moment of individual 
identity the little Rin senses a soft- 
ness between his body and that of 
the Founder. With deep sadness he 
comprehends that it is one of the 
Tenders and as little Rin and Foun- 
der merge to unity, the Aggregate 
also experiences sharp regret at so 
damaging a servant of the strangely 
aloof Smallest Friends.

Colonist glen philips died 
crushed between two mushrocks. 
Dr. Jeroboam Dufour injected Sara 
Philips with a potent sedative and 
sprayed a salve-bandage over the 
chemical bums on her face, arms, 
and hands, then sat with her until 
she slept. As soon as he was certain 
she would not awake he stormed di- 
rectly into the governor’s office. 

Governor Davis Buford asked 
quietly, “How’s Sara?’’ 

“Asleep.’’ Dufour snapped. 
“Why did you have her brought 
here? She’d’ve been all right on the 
farm. I don’t particularly appreciate 
having myself and my patient hustled 
at gunpoint halfway across the 
continent. ’ ’ 

“Would an apology help?” 

“No!” 

The governor sighed. “I thought 
not.” 

“An explanation would, Buffy.” 
Dr. Dufour settled into a chair 
across from a desk cluttered with the 
octuplicate forms of the burgeoning 
bureaucracy of the Capella 3 
Colonial Government. 

“Of course, Jare,” Buford 
smiled a practiced official smirk. 
“Sara’s a friend. So was Glen. I 
couldn’t leave her out there alone 
with hired hands. Those men aren’t 
the most savory characters, as we 
both know.” He attenuated his 
pitch into suggestiveness. 

Dufour glared. “I was there. I 
would have been with her and you 
knew it. Rafe Carter’s not one of 
your felonious imports; I could 

116 



leave my farm to my foreman and 
stay with Sara — being the only 
medic on Mycotare, I’ve had to ar- 
range things so I could be away for 
long periods. Explanation not ac- 
cepted!” 

The governor’s eyes opened 
wide. He frowned, then formed a 
rueful grin. “Why, Jare, I never 
thought! Of course, you. ...” 
“Don’t get coy with me, Buffy! 
What’s gone wrong?” 

Buford cocked his head. The 
gubernatorial expression slipped a 
fraction. What do you mean?” 
Jeroboam Dufour snapped onto 
his feet. Hunching his considerable 
bulk forward, he braced his fists on 
the governor’s desk. “Save that 
supercilious pose for your political 
friends or for the Earthcol represen- 
tatives. I treated Sara Philips for 
acid burns — not the base bums you 
normally get off a mushrock.” The 
doctor straightened and clamped his 
hands behind his back. His black 
eyes turned cold. “What are you 
hiding. Gov? Murder?” 

For one hasty moment, the gov- 
ernor’s eyes narrowed. Soft-faced, 
he purred, “Of course not! Are you 
saying I could accuse Sara of such a 
thing?” Then he forced the 
neighborly grin reserved for col- 
onists onto his face. “Do sit down, 
Jare. I’ll get a crick in my neck 
staring up at you. We’re friends; 
surely you don’t have to overwhelm 
me with your admittedly impressive 
physical presence?” 

Dr. Dufour sat. He hrumphed. 

GALAXY 




“Sorry, Buffy. It’s not murder. 
You’ve got something classified.’’ 

“Oh?” mouthed Buford. 

“Glen was dead before those 
rocks ever came together.” 

After a pause, the governor 
asked, “You saw that?” 

“No,” countered Dufour. “All I 
saw of Glen was a hand and his 
head sticking out from the rocks. I 
listened to Sara before I sedated 
her. Those two mushrocks were 
moving toward each other and Glen 
went in between them to retrieve a 
shovel. He was trapped. Some sort 
of tentacle went right through him. 
Sara tried to get him loose but more 
of the things ate through him before 
she could; that’s how she got 
burned. Glen was already dead 
when Rafe pulled her off. Rafe did 
see it, Buffy.” 

“Ah,” sighed Governor Buford, 
“perhaps we should bring Rafe Car- 
ter in as well. He may well have 
been burned.” 

“He wasn’t, and I wouldn’t try 
arresting him. Rafe won’t have a 
patient to protect.” 

“Arrest!” 

“You call it what you want. Can 
I walk past your guards?” 

“I’d hoped you might stay a 
while for Sara.” 

“Thought so,” said Dufour. 
“It’s the mushrocks.” 

“What is?” 

“The information you’re suppress- 
ing; the mushrocks are on the 
move.” 

“There’s nothing unusual in that. 
ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION 



We’ve known since the original 
survey that the mushrocks occasion- 
ally travel about.” Buford’s official 
grin faded before Dufour’ s glare. 

“We’ve known that they repro- 
duce by fission and that the newbies 
separate. Never has there been any 
incident where the fungoids moved 
toward each other and they have 
always kept exact distances from 
each other. In fact. I’ve had one 
fenced in my yard for several years 
and though its range was severely 
limited the surrounding mushrocks 
kept precisely the same distance 
from it as from each other. I’d got- 
ten rather attached to that little fel- 
low. 

Several days ago he, er, it got rest- 
less and started circling the edge 
of the enclosure. Finally it hunkered 
down and stayed put. Then I 
opened the gate and it left — minced 
across my fields without damaging 
a single mushroom — and headed in 
the direction of the Philips farm.” 

The governor steepled his fingers 
and touched the tips to his mouth. 
“Wouldn’t it be ironic if your pet 
was the one that killed Glen?” 

“It was,” murmured Dufour. “I 
knew every curve, every blemish, 
every blend of coloring on that 
rock — but I’m not about to accuse 
an overgrown mushroom of pre- 
meditated murder!” 

“Those ‘overgrown mushrooms,’ 
as you call them, are creating havoc 
on Mycotare.” Buford slammed his 
fist onto the desk. “All right. Dr. 
Dufour, you are second in com- 

117 




mand of this colony and you have a 
right to know. Reports have been 
coming in from all over the planet. 
These movements could wipe out 
this year’s crop. That would mean 
disaster for the colony since this 
year’s profit will provide the final 
payment to Earthcol. If we miss 
that final payment, the interest con- 
verts to one hundred percent and 
Earth Colonial Administration re- 
tains 51 percent of our stock. We 
remain colonists forever. We’ve 
worked too hard and too long to 
lose out now.” The governor’s 
voice rang and trembled in fervid 
passion. 

Dufour snorted. “We! When did 
you ever tend a mushroom!” 

“fare, colonial administration 
isn’t exactly play!” 

“I didn’t mean that, Bufly, but 
don’t pull that fellow farmer clap on 
me. I helped start this colony and 
you’ve only been here five ye^rs.” 
“Four and a half.” 

“Four and a half Earth years! 
You don’t even tell time the same 
way we do. When we buy our in- 
dependence, we elect the governor. 
You may not win that election. Huf- 
fy.” 

“Meaning you intend to run 
against me.” 

Dufour sighed, his attitude soften- 
ing. “I don’t know. I’ve got too 
much with the farm and the doctor- 
ing. We need more physicians and 
that has got to be one of our first 
priorities when we get out from un- 
der Earthcol and its stringent rules. 

118 



Another thing we’ve got to face 
once we lose colonial status is that 
we forfeit our colonial discount 
from suppliers. We’re not self- 
supporting yet — not by a megayear 
we’re not. Life never evolved 
beyond the protist stage here and 
we’ve got to complete vitalizing the 
soil to raise the crops we need to 
complete the food chain. We simply 
cannot afford to continue importing 
feed for our livestock. We’re in a 
fine position to import hardware. 
We can hold off on industrial de- 
velopment but not on agricultural. 
We farmers know that — even if you 
don’t!” 

And I know that!” Buford rose 
and paced heavily. “Do you hon- 
estly believe I don’t comprehend 
what problems we face as a free 
planet? We’ve located on a reason- 
ably comfortable planet that does 
not happen to have the current 
capacity to grow food for us.” 

“Man does not live by mush- 
rooms alone.” Dufour grinned. 

The governor groaned dutifully, 
secretly pleased at the improvement 
in Dufour’s demeanor. “As long as 
transplanted Terrans don’t lose their 
taste for mushrooms, which have so 
admirably mutated here into 
fleshier, tastier specimens. ...” 

“Nor their need for penicillin de- 
rivatives or molds for cheese or all 
those other good things we use 
fungi for. We’re not exactly 
unilateral — and we’ve got potential 
new discoveries.” 

“Only potential?” 



GALAXY 




“Sure! None of my experiments 
will be complete until after Inde- 
pendence Day — whenever it is. Earth- 
col’s not going to get rights to our 
hard work.” Dufour grinned. 
‘‘We’ll make it, Buffy. After all, 
business is mushrooming.” 

‘‘Jeroboam! I certainly did not 
expect that from you!” 

‘‘Why? Did I steal your line?” 
Grinning hugely, Dufour continued. 
‘‘Nevertheless, our suppliers could 
ruin us unless we can come to terms 
with them.” 

‘‘They do seem to have us 
between a rock and a hard place.” 
‘‘Or between two mushrocks,” 
Dufour rasped. ‘‘What kind of pat- 
tern have you picked up from those 
reports?” 

‘‘Well,” Buford hedged, ‘‘I 
haven’t had time to go through them 
all.” 

‘‘What?” Dufour asked, mys- 
tified. ‘‘What did we save our cred- 
its for fifteen years for? Haven’t 
you fed them into that superfancy 
imported computer?” 

‘‘I haven’t had time.” 

‘‘‘Why can’t your secretary do 
it?” 

‘‘You forget the secret nature 
of.-. .” 

‘‘Give me the reports!” Dufour 
loomed over the governor and 
stretched out his hand. ‘‘I’ll set it 
for visual scan and it’ll go as fast as 
I can feed the papers. Come on, 
give me the reports.” He narrowed 
his eyes and waited. Without further 
word, Buford unlocked a drawer 



and pulled out several sheafs of 
flimsy paper and a half dozen video 
cartridges and passed them over. 

The doctor snatched up the lot 
and stalked over to the computer 
outlet. He stuffed the first cartridge 
into the slot, set the intake to 
maximum, and dropped the others 
into the autofeed bin. Then, after 
slapping a series of switches, 
Dufour began slipping the pages of 
the flimsies into the computer’s 
manual read-in. After a time his 
arms fell into the rhythm and as his 
eyes unfocused, he proceeded in a 
seeming trance. 

The last page slipped in, flashed 
into the working banks, and was 
ionized. Jeroboam Dufour blinked, 
stretched, groaned, and rubbed stif- 
fening back and shoulder muscles. 
He punched out a command to di- 
gest and summarize. A hand ap- 
peared in his side vision. It held a 
cup and, from the cup, rose a 
shimmery cloud. ‘‘Uh, thanks, Buf- 
fy.” 

‘‘Thought you could use some 
coffee. I slipped out and got some.” 

‘‘You still drinking that? Wish I 
had the money to afford such lux- 
ury.” He sipped cautiously at the 
steaming brew. ‘‘Almost forgot 
what it tastes like. I may just like 
staying here for a while, after all!” 
The two laughed. Dufour thrummed 
his fingertips on the computer table 
until the readout snicked out of the 
side. He snapped it off and perused 
the summary. Columns of map 
coordinates interspersed with num- 

119 



ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION 




bers of entities. “Thorough!” 
“Some of those cartridges in- 
cluded the satellite weather station 
pictures. I ordered a full-scale in- 
vestigation as soon as I realized it 
was not a local phenomenon.” 
Dufour scratched his head, flip- 
ped the voder lever on the compu- 
ter, and said, “Summarize your 
summary. No numbers. Verbal de- 
scription of trend. ’ ’ 

“Mushrocks are forming into 
aggregates within conscriptive 
boundaries. Earliest observed group 
movements toward a common center 
occurred along the equator. Move- 
ments expanded centripetally from 
equator progression to furthermost 
limits of mushrock range. Distance 
from equator and time of aggrega- 
tion are directly correlative. Antici- 
pate aggregate grouping of all mush- 
rocks. Insufficient data for further 
prediction. Insufficient data for de- 
termination of cause. Jeroboam, 
without use of numbers, Angel can- 
not complete description.” 

“Who’s Angel?’’ snapped 
Buford. 

Grinning broadly, Dufour replied, 
“He is,” and pointed to the compu- 
ter outlet. “When I set up the ver- 
bal phase, I had to give him a voice; 
mine was the only one handy. 
And I named him.” He leaned to- 
ward the microphone pickup. 
“Thanks, Angel. That is sufficient. 
I’ll study your printout.” 

“Questions, Jeroboam?’’ 

“Not yet. I don’t read as fast as 
you do.” Dufour looked toward the 
120 



governor. “I’d like to take my time 
on these figures. Okay if I take the 
printout to my room, whever it is?” 
“Keep it, Jare.” Buford smiled, 
not entirely officially. “I got the 
complete reports for you, anyway, 
since I remembered your scientific 
curiosity.” His expression firmed. 
“In the interest of the Capella 3 
colony. I’ve already determined 
how to deal with the threat. ’ ’ ' 
“How?” 

“By destroying the mushrocks.” 
Each maintaining the proper so- 
cial distance the Rin Aggregates 
rove their personal districts. The 
symmetrical procession is suspended 
now and then as an Aggregate dain- 
tily feeds on the richness beneath 
the surface of the soil. One Aggre- 
gate pauses and, with extreme dis- 
taste, absorbs the soft, offensive in- 
trusion that is trapped between its 
parts. The Aggregate shudders con- 
vulsively at the flavor of the unfor- 
tunate Tender; but however 
brutishly inelegant it is unavoidable 
if the Aggregate is to survive. The 
unwelcome infringement is hinder- 
ing total unity of the separate parts 
of this Aggregate. To be One and to 
achieve the highest destiny of the 
Rin — such a desire outweighs the 
hideously obscene task. 

Afterwards the Aggregate rests, 
laboriously assimilating and trans- 
forming the unique composition of 
the Tender. 

The embarrassing interruption 
has retarded the development of this 
Aggregate but now it feels the 

GALAXY 




urgency. Some few of the former 
individuals composing the Aggre- 
gate separate from their positions 
and differentiate their forms. Their 
bodies secrete the matter to harden 
and stiffen the new growth. Others 
disconnect and climb up the rigid 
support. At the top they form a 
sphere. 

The sphere grows and augments 
as the new life within pulses and 
strains. The Aggregate incorporates 
its essence into the myriad descen- 
dants erwased in the sphere. “Grow 
and prosper, my children. Multiply 
in peace and harmony. Always re- 
member that the Way is harmony 
and unity.” 

The sphere explodes. Each child, 
fully cognizant of Rinness and indi- 
viduality, bursts headlong into free- 
dom. All are heedless of the parent 
Rin as it shrinks into itself. Feeding 
stops. Awareness fades for the Rin 
Aggregate and soon it will be dead. 
For it has fulfilled the purpose of 
Rin being. 

“You can’t be serious?’’ Dufour 
gaped at the governor. 

“Deadly serious. I hesitated too 
long and Glen Philips was killed. 
I’ve already ordered my troops 
out.’’ 

“Method?” 

“Laser-induced combustion. The 
mushrocks burn quite readily if 
they’re ignited all at once. If we set 
only one part afire, the thing drops 
off the burning segment.” Buford 
laughed. “It’s quite a sight to see 
one of those things go up. ’ ’ 

ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION 



Dufour bounded onto his feet. 
“Did you ever think what conse- 
quences there might be?” 

“That’s why I’ve acted as I did. 
Our colony is at stake.” 

“You’re destroying a life-form!” 
“Don’t give me that, Jare. Even 
you called them overgrown mush- 
rooms.” 

“What if they have an intelli- 
gence we don’t recognize?” 

“Bosh!” Governor Buford re- 
clined in his contour chair. “That’s 
why I’ll be elected rather than you. 

I consider my people’s needs. When 
their crops are in jeopardy, I act 
without any reflex-humanistic de- 
lay.” 

“You’ve not considered every- 
thing — ecological balance!” 

“Ecological bull!” rapped the 
governor. “The colonists already 
upset that.” 

“Not upset. Changed: Modified. 
Everything done was studied and es- 
timated as to outcome. You’re re- 
moving in toto one sector of an an- 
cient balance.” Dufour collapsed 
onto the couch. He groaned, “Who 
knows what those mushrocks were 
keeping in check?” 

“We’ll handle that later.” 

“And what if ‘that’ is a danger- 
ous enemy?” 

“What do you think the mush- 
rocks are?” raged Buford. 

“They’re not enemies! They 
haven’t damaged the crops. They have 
not yet done anything against us.” 
Coldly, the governor said, “They 
killed Glen.’: 

121 




“Accident!” 

The radiocom flared into violent 
signals and a harsh voice distracted 
the governor. “Sir! Chief Truckee 
here. Coordinated lasering is doing 
the job okay but these things sure 
do stink when they bum! We just 
got on to one that had a stalk thing 
coming out of its back but before 
we could bum it a ball thing on top 
of the stalk split wide open and 
some powder flew off in all direc- 
tions. We ran the powder through 
the lab and it’s a bunch of baby 
mushrocks!” 

Stepping to the radiocom, the 
governor ordered, “Step up the 
program. Double shifts round the 
• clock. Go after the ones with stalks 
first and burn the powder too.” 
Shutting down, Buford glared at Dr. 
Dufour. “That’s the difference 
between an administrator and a 
farmer — or a doctor. I see the big 
picture and I act. I don’t 
mollycoddle — anything or anyone! 
You understand me?” 

Dufour’s heart was thudding so 
powerfully he almost feared it 
would alarm the governor. He 
drawled carefully, “Yes, I do. 
You’re a hard man, Buffy.” He 
swallowed sourly. “Guess I’m just 
a curious sawbones.” He tried to 
look official. “Anyway, I’ve got to 
make tests — take measurements and 
such. We don’t have data on the 
new slug things and Earthcol will 
have your hide and mine for office 
decor if we don’t get all possible 
info on a vanishing species.” There 

122 



ought to be some up near the win- 
terlands that haven’t come together 
yet. I should be able to stay far 
enough ahead of your incendiary 
troops to collect enough data for 
Earthcol.” 

Buford smirked. “I’ll send an es- 
cort with you. You’ll need some- 
body to. .look after you.” 

Dufour managed a sheepish grin. 
“You’re right. Once I forgot to eat 
for three days when I was watching 
a mutating. .thanks, Buffy. You 
sure do think of everything. Give 
me the coordinates and I’ll radio 
Rafe and have him bring my por- 
talab.”

Huddling over a smdll camping 
stove in the wind-blasted tent, Rafe 
Carter nodded to Jeroboam when he 
came through the double flaps. 
“Didn’t think he’d let you go.” 
“You guessed I was a prisoner?” 
“I smelled it. Something’s up- 
wind, sure.” 

“And I smell tea.” 

Carter extended a sweated mug of 
a dark and pungent liquid. “Sure 
do. Ground up the rhizopus myself. 
Don’t worry about the gov’mint 
boys. They don’t know about it.” 
“Which rhizopus?” Jeroboam let 
the aroma warm his chilled nostrils. 

“Mixture. Three kinds. Figured it 
out myself. Like it?” 

“Yeah! I hope you remember the 
proportions.” 

“I do. Wait till Independence! 

GALAXY 




We’ll hit the market with our fun- 
gus tea. Hey, Doc, we might just 
get rich one of these days.” 

Jeroboam Dufour grinned at his 
dark foreman. “If Davey Buford 
doesn’t do us all in before.” He 
frowned and chuckled warmly. 
“We better not call it fungus tea. 
We should devise some fancy han- 
dle.” 

“You’ll come up with something. 
Speaking of up, what is? I got a 
whiff of big trouble in your voice 
when you called. I came equipped 
and the escorts don’t know that 
either.” The burly foreman patted 
his jacket. 

“I don’t know. Could be no- 
thing. Could be disaster. Buford’s 
launched an all out extermination 
program against the mushrocks and 
the slugs they turned into.” 

“He can’t do that!” yelped Car- 
ter. 

“He’s doing it. We need a way 
to stop it. With the mushrocks 
yanked out of the ecosystem, their 
natural food will multiply. Maybe 
we can’t handle that, though we 
probably can.” 

“The cost of controlling the sub- 
surface slideybugs might break us.” 
Carter frowned. 

“What bothers me is the possibil- 
ity there’s something else we don’t 
know about. Something they keep 
from bothering us now.” 

The foreman rattled a pan and 
tossed in a hefty chunk of steak. In 
another smaller pan, he fanned 
wafer slices of hollow-stemmed 



morels; they spattered in the golden 
liquid. “Butter. Figured you’d need 
the best this jaunt.” For several 
moments, he concentrated on sautee- 
ing the delicate mushroom slabs. 
He turned the steak and said, 
“Didn’t Buford think about the 
dangers when he went off on this 
wild slug chase?” 

“I’m sure it’s a political ploy to 
impress his future voters.” 

“He doesn’t impress me!” 

“Nor me! He’s overlooked — 
either deliberately or unconsciously — 
some factors which could be vital.” 
Carter slapped the massive steak 
onto one plate, slashed it in half 
and edged the slightly larger half 
onto another plate. After spooning 
browned slices of mushrooms over 
the top, he handed the second plate 
to Dufour. “Jeroboam, I’ve got a 
bad feeling about this.” 

“Why?” Dufour gnawed on the 
steak. 

“I dunno. I just got a feeling.” 

“I always trust your hunches and 
this time I’ve got one too. Come 
first light, we’ll get a close look at 
the congregating.” 

“Right! I spotted a loner that 
looks like it’s going to hook up to- 
morrow. Only about half a mile 
off.” 

“Lucky! With those coordinates 
Buffy tossed out, I thought we’d be 
set down spang in the middle of the 
snowlands.” Silently the men ate, 
occasionally nodding at each other 
in mutual enjoyment. Jeroboam set 
down his plate. “Rafe, did you ever 

123 



ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION 




consider cooking as a profession?” 

‘‘What, and stay inside all the 
time? No way, Doc! I like riding 
herd on your mushrooms and your 
cows.” 

Sliding into his sleeping sack, 
Jeroboam set the heat control and 
grinned. ‘‘One of these days we’ll 
get that horse and you really will be 
riding.” 

‘‘If I can ever cut him loose from 
your kids!” 

The two men listened to the night 
noises of the northern latitudes. The 
wind carried the sounds of coarse 
voices from the trooper escort in 
their flimsy tents. Jeroboam mut- 
tered, ‘‘I can’t let them kill off the 
mushrocks. I got a hunch our 
neighbors might be super-protists, 
intelligent unicellular beings. 

‘‘Well I’ll be damned! — ^They do 
act pretty bright sometimes.” 

‘‘We probably both will be,” 
commented Jeroboam Dufour and 
rolled over. 

The next morning they began 
their study. 

Openly distrustful of the mush- 
rocks, the escort troopers main- 
tained several lengths between 
themselves and the moving or- 
ganisms. Carter grinned at Dufour. 
‘‘Staying that far back, they sure 
won’t bother us.” 

‘‘It’s starting!” Jeroboam pointed 
to a protuberance, little more than a 
swollen knob, on the leading edge 
of the single mushrock as it ap- 
proached the conglomerate. While 
they watched, filming the process, 

124 



the knob grew, changing colors in 
rainbow hues. Then, with astonish- 
ing speed, a strand shot from the 
rock to the collection and attached 
firmly. Touching the strand with a 
long probe, the doctor tested its ten- 
sile strength. ‘‘Tough but resilient.” 
Scraping a bit of the moisture from 
the tendril, he fed it to the portalab. 
‘‘Concentrated hydrosulfuric acid!” 
He positioned certain recording de- 
vices and glanced around. ‘‘How’s 
it look?” 

‘‘Clear so far. The next one 
won’t be here till tomorrow after- 
noon. They move a lot slower in 
the cold latitudes.” Carter stared 
toward the shining milky facade to 
the north. ‘‘Wind’s coming off that 
snow.” He shivered. 

“Damnation!” 

“What’s the matter. Doc?” 
Jeroboam stooped to pick up the 
electrode he had dropped. “Trying 
to hook up and my fingers are get- 
ting stiff. But I can’t manage these 
wires with gloves on.” 

“Here, let me.” Carter slipped 
off his right glove and took up the 
wire. He edged into the opening 
and reached up his arm to loop the 
wire over the single fastened tendril 
while Dufour secured the other end 
to record electrical impulses. 

Jeroboam savy the beginning of a 
startling triple sine curve at the 
same instant he heard the hoarse 
yelp. “Rafe!” 

A second tendril extended 
through Carter’s right forearm. The 
cloth of his heavy jacket was jagged 

GALAXY 




and burned about the edges of the 
hole. Carter ground his teeth. “I 
never even saw it.” He forced a 
stiff grin. ‘‘Quick as lightning. 
Something else for your records. 
Bums like hell.” 

Jeroboam Dufour examined the 
flesh after he tore away the cloth. 
He paled. ‘‘It’s between the bones. 
I’ll have to cut it.” From the por- 
talab toolbox, he pulled out a scal- 
pel, snicked it on and touched the 
keen edge to the tendril. The tendril 
bent but did not yield. 

Softly, Carter muttered, 
‘‘Jeroboam. Behind you.” 

And behind Dufour showed mul- 
tiple swollen knobs on the encroach- 
ing mushrock. Each flashed its own 
special rainbow and swelled alarm- 
ingly. 

‘‘Jerry, get me out of here,” Car- 
ter whispered. 

Jerob^m’s throat constricted. ‘‘I 
can’t cut you out!” 

Rafe Carter leveled his dark gaze 
into Dufour’s eyes. ‘‘Jerry, for god- 
sake, help me,” he said softly. 

Dr. Dufour extended the blade of 
the scalpel to its full length. He 
meshed his teeth and slashed the 
merciless blade through his friend’s 
elbow. 

* « * 

The Elver awoke from the Long 
Sleep. Cautiously, the wily creature 
extended his senses through the in- 
ner shell. The outer shell was truly 
dissolving! The senses spread and 



tingled lightly upon the surrounding 
countryside. 

Within the range of the Elver’s 
sensing dwelt not one single Rin! 

Ah, but this Elver had been 
fooled before. Once he was nearly 
trapped by a clever Rin who had 
blocked Elver-sensing of Rin pres- 
ence. 

The Elver concentrated sensing to 
within one elver-length. So concen- 
trated that not even a Rin Aggre- 
gate could deceive. 

Slowly the inner shell weakened 
dissolved vanished beneath the 
Great Light. The Elver squirmed un- 
til his tender flesh clouded against 
the light. 

Then the Elver became true 
Elver. He lifted and floated weakly, 
hovering close to the ground. He 
knew he must find food quickly even 
if only to spore again to save him 
from the Rin. 

Suddenly the Elver quivered. He 
sensed food close by and he hugged 
the ground. This food was strange 
and moved freely along the ground. 
Yet he sensed it was good. The 
swiftly moving prey stepped stupily 
into the Elver. It struggled though 
the weak thrashings did not dis- 
commode the Elver. He absorbed 
the unique food. 

The energy of the food burst into 
the Elver. He quivered shivered 
shuddered contained the inexplica- 
bly enormous amount of food ener- 
gy. Joy threaded through the Elver 
and he launched into the sky. 

He roamed, all powerful, seeking 

125 



ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION 




more of the energy-packed food. He 
sensed another another another. A 
small group of the new food was be- 
low him. 

He dropped and absorbed the 
amazing new food that had ap- 
peared during his Long Sleep.

The computer said, “Jeroboam?” 
“Yes, Angel?” 

“Report under heading Unusual 
Life -form Activity. Source: Radio 
contact from trooper camp zero 
slash four oh zee.” 

“Location?” 

“Near the equator and on the 
Philips Farm. Radio contact men- 
tions a grey cloud engulfing 
Trooper Lanson. Total absorption. 
No remains. No further radio con- 
tact from that base in seven hours 
and twelve minutes.” 

“How many mushrocks in that 
sector?” 

“Base had previously reported 
all located mushrocks in their sector 
burned and destroyed. Additional 
note. 

Governor Buford is attempting to 
monitor clinic outlet.” 

“Thank you, Angel.” 

“You’re welcome, Jeroboam.” 
Jeroboam stalked into the clinic 
ward and leaned over Rafe Carter, 
whose black skin glistened with 
sweat. “How’s it going?” 

“My fingers still hurt.” Rafe 
managed a hazy grin. “Nobody’s 
told my nerves they’re not there.” 

126 



Jeroboam opened his mouth, 
shrugged, and closed it again. 

“Jeroboam,” whispered the 
groggy foreman, “you did right.” 
He swallowed. “Trust my hunch. 
Amputation is better than death. A 
lot better. ’ ’ 

Jeroboam Dufour headed down 
the hall toward the governor’s quar- 
ters. He was stopped in the an- 
teroom by an armed set of troopers. 
Their leader said, “Sony, Doctor. 
Governor’s orders. Strip.” 

Rigidly, Dufour removed his 
clothes and stood stiffly beneath 
searching fingers. One guard probed 
his clothing at length. The lead 
trooper stood back and snapped, 
“Turn around. Bend over.” 
Jeroboam suffered this final in- 
dignity and donned his clothes in 
scarlet silence. Once inside, he said 
gruffly, “Is it everybody you don’t 
trust or just me, Buffy?” 

“Surely my guards weren’t rough 
with you, Jare.” 

“Not rough,” growled Jeroboam. 
“They didn’t have to enjoy it so 
much.” 

“Boys will be boys.” 

“Not with me they won’t!” All 
at once, Dufour laughed hugely. 
“Some of your felonious imports, I 
take it.” He noted a black box on 
the table in the dining room. “I 
hope your checkout boys weren’t 
rough on my special baby.” 

“They followed your orders pre- 
cisely and didn’t touch the contents. 
And I, true to my word,” he 
handed over a key, “have not 



GALAXY 




peeked at all, though I anxiously 
await.” 

‘‘Did your chef get my flat of 
truffles?” 

“Yes.” 

“I sent him the flat they were 
raised in, undisturbed; and your 
chef is almost as much an expert in 
mushrooms as I am.” 

“Yes, I saw them myself.” 
Buford relaxed visibly. “They are 
beautiful. Mutations?” 

“No, they just grow better here. 
I’ve been culling for years and 
that’s my best flat,” Jeroboam 
smiled. “I had to do something to 
thank you for letting us take Rafe to 
my farm for surgery before trans- 
porting him all the way here.” 

‘‘Of course,” purred Buford. 
“Your farm is well equipped and 
much closer to the winterlands.” 
“Though I must admit,” mur- 
mured Jeroboam, “I ought to take 
my truffles back after your welcom- 
ing committee outside!” 

“Now, Jare, do forgive me their 
thoroughness.” Buford forged the 
gubernatorial grin. “But I will have 
a talk with them in the morning.” 
Jeroboam placed the key on top 
of the cubical black box and seated 
himself at one end of the table. 
“When do we eat?” He chuckled 
nasally as his pulse quickened. 
“Sony to be so rude but I haven’t 
eaten since last night.” 

Ringing for service. Governor 
Buford nodded. “Forgetful as usu- 
al, eh, Jare?” 

Though he was famished. 



Jeroboam found his stomach cramp- 
ing in nervous rebellion at his 
forced eating. Sweat tickled his face 
and he noted Buford staring. “More 
tired than I realized.” He forced a 
weak grin. 

The governor grinned back. “If 
you intended for me to eat toxic 
mushrooms, you’ve killed only 
yourself. You alone ate your special 
present to me. Dr. Dufour. My chef 
had special orders.” 

Jeroboam slumped in the plush 
dining chair. His chortle became a 
laugh, a guffaw. “So! That recep- 
tion outside your doors was for me. 
You’re being foolish.” He leaned 
forward and said gravely, “I’m not 
going to kill you. You may be de- 
stroying the colony but I’m not go- 
ing to kill you. You may be de- 
stroying an intelligent life- 
form. .” 

'^‘Nonsense!” 

“Your escort brought in my re- 
corders and I just had time to check 
them out. The mushrocks give off 
signals remarkably similar to alpha 
brain waves — among others. 

They’re very likely intelligent.” 

“Balderdash!” 

“Hadn’t heard that one in a 
while. Buffy, you are not only 
foolish, you are absurd. But I am 
not going to kill you.” He paused, 
head throbbing. “Only an angel can 
do that.” 

Buford snapped his glance toward 
the computer outlet in the dining 
room. “You’ve tampered with the 
computer.” 



ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION 



127 




“Do you really think so? 
Angel!” 

“Yes, Jeroboam.” 

“If I told you to kill Governor 
Buford, what would you do?” 
“Nothing.” 

“Why?” 

‘ 7 am not equipped to respond in 
that area.” 

“Computer!” The voice was 
Buford’s. 

“Yes, Governor.” 

“If you were equipped with ap- 
propriate extensors, would you obey 
a command to kill me?” 

“Yes, if the command comes 
from Jeroboam. ’ ' 

Davis Buford produced a thermal 
pistol and leveled it at Jeroboam’s 
head. “We’ll see to that. I’ll re- 
program your pet angel so you 
won’t have access. You will release 
it from all personal private codes. If 
you don’t,” he compressed the trig- 
ger handle, “it won’t make any dif- 
ference.” 

Jeroboam smiled languidly. 
“Don’t be silly. That computer is 
no angel of death. The name is only 
a term to describe a disembodied 
voice.” He paused, then; “Well, I 
thought you were excited about the 
early completion of one of my ex- 
periments.” He jerked his chin to- 
ward the black box. “I won’t even 
touch it; you open it. Your boys have 
already done it once so you know it’s 
not boobied. ’ ’ 

“I mean what I said about the 
computer. You will be programed 
out of it in the morning.” Still 

128 



holding the pistol, the governor pull- 
ed the box toward him. He inserted 
the key and turned it slowly. The 
box opened flat to display a single 
mushroom. 

Tall, stately, white as purest 
marble, it stood in unblemished per- 
fection. Jeroboam Dufour swelled 
his chest. “Touch her,” he 
breathed. “Isn’t she beautiful?” His 
eyes gleamed. “Feel how smooth 
her flesh is. Gently, Buffy. She’s 
about to drop her spores. That’s it. 
Look very closely. You won’t find 
an imperfection anywhere. Even the 
veil near the top of the stem is per- 
fect.” Jeroboam watched the gover- 
nor as he set the pistol aside to run 
his fingers over the snowy speci- 
men. “She’s eight years old and 
almost exactly twelve inches tall. 
Isn’t she lovely? A mutation, of 
course.” 

“I’ve never seen one like this. 
You have others?” 

“Yes, but this was the most per- 
fect and the only one ready to 
spore.” 

“Do you have a complete report 
ready?” 

“It won’t take any time at all to 
reproduce my notes.” 

The governor rubbed his stomach 
and blinked. “What exactly is the 
purpose of this one?” 

“Does she need a purpose? Only 
see how lovely she is to see and 
touch.” 

“Earthcol isn’t engaged in the 
business of conducting shows and 
awarding prizes. What do we get 

GALAXY 




out of this one?” The governor 
rubbed the back of his hand over 
his eyes and gasped. 

‘‘We? You mean they, don’t 
you?” smiled Dufour. ‘‘Feeling a 
bit strange? Just nerves, Buffy, like 
me. Relax.” 

Buford doubled over and groaned 
sharply. He flopped into his chair. 
‘‘Jare, I’m sick.” 

‘‘You’re not sick, Buffy.” 
Dufour droned, ‘‘You wanted to 
know the purpose of my lovely 
white darling. She’s a mutated 
Amanita bisporigera.” 

‘‘The destroying angel!” 

‘‘Deadly poison. Always fatal.” 
‘‘You’re the fool. Doctor Dufour. 
I’ll not eat any of your toadstool.” 
‘‘Hush! Don’t insult her. At any 
rate, you don’t have to. You’ve 
breathed the fumes and absorbed the 
toxin through your skin. This 
Amanita is deadlier than any ancest- 
ral Earth mushroom.” When Buford 
snatched the pistol and wavered it 
toward Jeroboam, the doctor leaned 
back in his chair and drawled, ‘‘It’s 
better to amputate. I’m amputating. 
The colony will survive as a unit 
even though one part of it does 
not.” 

‘‘I’ll kill you.” The governor 
grasped the pistol in both hands. 

Jeroboam murmured, ‘‘I hope so. 
If not. I’ve got to live with the fact 
I let you die.” 

‘‘Can you save me?” Buffy 
whispered. 

‘‘I’ve touched her. I’ve breathed 
her perfume for years. I’ve de- 

ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION 



veloped an immunity — and an anti- 
dote which was one purpose of my 
research.” 

‘‘Save me, Jare!” The governor 
wheezed. 

Dr. Dufour strode to the end of 
the table. 

The pistol waveringly followed 
him. 

‘ ‘Jeroboam. ’ ’ 

‘‘What is it, Angel?” 

“Fact: the colony has only one 
physician. Fact: the colony has one 
governor. Situation: the governor is 
dying. The physician is second in 
command. If both are dead, the 
colony is without experienced lead- 
ership and medical assistance in the 
last year of colonial status. Conclu- 
sion: permanent colonial status.” 

The pistol quavered and the gov- 
ernor’s fleshy fingers tightened 
around the trigger handle. Jeroboam 
lunged and seized the governor’s 
wrists. As he tugged at the gover- 
nor’s death grip, his face came 
close to Buford’s. Dr. Dufour stared 
into the clouding eyes; he felt the 
gasping breaths warm his cheek. 

The pistol hissed. The edge of 
the beam caressed Jeroboam’s skin 
and he shivered in agony. 

Then Davis Buford slid from his 
chair to lie rumpled on the polished 
floor. 

Jeroboam stood back and stared 
down at his demolished shirt and 
blistered skin. Gazing sadly at the 
stately, elegant Amanita, he re- 
trieved the pistol from Buford’s 
limp hand. He touched the comers 

129 




of the governor’s eyes and pushed 
the lids down. 

Jeroboam whispered, “I forgot to 
mention this variety kills within mi- 
nutes instead of hours.” 
“Governor.” 

“He’s dead, Angel.” 

“Governor Jeroboam.” 

“Oh!” 

“You instructed Angel to inform 
you when the Earthcol representa- 
tive settled orbit.” 

“I did?” Jeroboam rubbed his 
eyes. 

“The governor did. You are the 
governor. ’ ’ 

“Not for long.” 

“Until the election following In- 
dependence. Shall Angel quote the 
pertinent article and section?” 

“No. I know it.' Just until then, 
however.” 

“Prediction: no opposition can- 
didate will result in unanimous elec- 
tion of Jeroboam Dufour to gover- 
norship.” 

“Who asked you?” 

“You programed Angel to re- 
spond appropriately.” 

“Respond to this, then. I am a 
physician. I have just killed a 
man.” Jeroboam waited. 

Tiny clickings shattered the dreary 
silence. 

“Amputation is preferable to 
death.” 

“You were listening to Rafe and 
me!” 

“No. When you programed 
Angel, you installed your own per- 
sonality.” 

130 



“You are as amoral as an 
angel.” 

“No. Seventy-three circuits 
shorted. Angel is now using new 
pathways.” 

“Let us hope the doctor can find 
new neural pathways!” 

“The doctor is homo sapiens and 
therefore has more potential circuits 
than Angel who is computer Model 
C dash 12.” 

“The doctor is human and has 
violated his oath.” Jeroboam 
glanced at the Amanita. “The col- 
ony will need a new doctor.” He 
straightened his shoulders. “If I’m 
to be governor, I’ll need a full time 
physician. We’ll treat with the Earth- 
col man. Program his shuttle in 
on auto.” The doctor’s voice went 
steady. “Activate your weather 
satellite contact and locate some 
mushrocks. Thin the population and 
transport specimens to the equator 
until that grey cloud is stopped. ’ ’ 

“There are two clouds now, 
Governor. ’ ’ 

“Hustle it, then. I’ll stop Buffy’s 
extermination teams. We might still 
get to know our mushrock 
neighbors after all. Perhaps we 
shouldn’t call them ‘mushrocks’ any 
more; they’re not like mushrooms at 
all.” He laughed hugely. 
“Myxomycophyta! Lowly slime 
molds and they’re intelligent!” As 
he punched the code for the trooper 
team leader into the radio, he 
grimaced. “Angel, our little joke 
isn’t funny anymore. From now on, 
answer to ‘Liberty’.” ★

Look, as a matter of course I 
have to assume that all you zombies 
out there are just like me: diletantes 
of reading. By this I mean that your 
standards are not too high. You go 
through at least a couple of paper- 
backs a week, and don’t insist that 
they all be Dostoievski. We can talk 
of a book as “great,” you and I, 
without meaning that future genera- 
tions of graduate students will count 
its adverbs and try to prove that it 
was really written by Sir Francis 
Bacon. There is no copy of Moby 
Dick on my bookshelf, and I don’t 
care who knows it. 

But I want to talk to you now 
about a book concerning which the 



131 




term “great” should have all those 
massive connotations, a book which 
bears multiple re-readings and is 
stupendously entertaining, enlighten- 
ing and mind-broadening even once. 

If you have already read Theo- 
dore Sturgeon’s immortal More 
Than Human, you’re permitted to 
skip this section and go on — if 
you’ve read it recently. It is, for my 
money, one of the all-time Greats 
of the fantasy-SF tradition. I picked 
up the most recent edition (I think) 
off the bookstore rack (as part of 
the policy I announced last month 
of imitating you, the hypothetical 
reader), because I hadn’t re-read it 
in nearly a decade — and I was com- 
pletely blown out. 

Either a short novel or a very 
long novelette by word-count. More 
Than Human is the direct antithesis 
of the silly canard that great litera- 
ture must imply “a recognition of 
the fallen state of Man,” and it’s 
astonishing that this book has been 
quietly sitting there waiting to be 
noticed for twenty-two years (to 
give you an idea just how long ago 
that was, nineteen years ago the 
Hugo for most promising new au- 
thor went to someone named Sil- 
verberg). 

Oh, it was noticed, all right. It 
won the International Fantasy 
Award, made pots of money, sol- 
idly established Ted’s reputation as 
a genius, and has undergone an en- 
tirely respectable number of reprint- 
ings. But it never copped a Hugo 
(none were given that year; the 

132 



world’s first had only been awarded 
the year before), never became the 
kind of cult classic that Dune or 
Stranger did, and I just know that 
enough of you have never read it to 
make this whole polemic worth- 
while. 

Darwin pissed off a whole lot of 
people with the notion that mankind 
had evolved from base origins. 
Perhaps equally humbling is the no- 
tion that we are still “base 
origins” — of the next evolutionary 
step. More Than Human suggests 
just that, tracing a progression from 
proconsul to Neanderthal to Homo 

Sap to Homo Gestalt. I 

don’t want to tell you any of the 
plot — discover it for yourself — so 
all I can say is that it’ll be a god- 
send to any of you out there who 
are tired of believing that the stale 
and rancid bucket of worms you’ve 
been seeing on TV and reading in 
your paper and in dismal books by 
despairing writers is Life, that the 
place we have reached is only the 
precipice from which we must 
surely tumble, that the only place to 
go from here is more refined and in- 
tricate perversions and a philosophi- 
cal acceptance of the inevitable de- 
cay. Wouldn’t it be funny if this 
were only the beginning? 

The only other thing to mention 
is that the middle third first ap- 
peared as the novelette “Baby Is 
Three” twenty-three years ago — in 
Galaxy.

GALAXY 




Back to modern-day science- 
fiction, and what do we find? A 
brand-new Stutz Bearcat. 

Think about that a second. You 
wouldn’t want an authentic Stutz — 
the state of the art in those days did 
not include fripperies like starters, 
shock absorbers or climate control, 
and they had a top speed below the 
current legal minimum. But suppose 
the ghost of Old Man Stutz came 
back, and built the ultimate ’Cat, us- 
ing the best materials and technol- 
ogy available today (which Detroit 
sure doesn’t), and gave it to you 
factory-new? I bet it’d beat hell out 
of a Toyota. 

Well, in a manner of speaking, 
it’s happened. Under the combined 
influence of the ghosts of Doc 
Smith and C.S. Forrester (not to 
mention lots of coffee and brandy), 
Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle 
have written the ultimate space op- 
era, blending all the classic ingre- 
dients in a work unmistakably mod- 
ern and new: The Mote In God's 
Eye. 

As near as 1 can figure out, 
Messrs. Niven & Pournelle haven’t 
left out a single thing: we have 
genital-less protagonists (named 
Rod and Sally, forsooth), comic- 
opera Scots and Russians unchanged 
in stereotype by the centuries (ever 
wonder what Ensign Chekhov 
would be like as an admiral?), a 
Gilbert & Sullivan space navy in 
which Horatio Hornblower would 
feel right at home, and even aliens 
with a Strange and Terrible Secret. 



Every element of a vintage ’30s 
classic is present (except, curiously, 
for the spectacular space warfare 
itself — no planets get hurled around, 
or any of that noise), and there’s 
even room left at the end for a 
sequel. {The Mote In God's Other 
Eye?) 

This all may sound to some of 
you like I’m panning the book, but 
I’m not — not by any means. It’s a 
damned fine novel of first contact, 
delicately walking that tightrope be- 
tween really alien and really unbe- 
lievable aliens in a way that re- 
minded me of Gordon R. Dickson’s 
The Alien Way. The evolutionary 
history of Mote's Moties strained 
my credibility a bit, but no more 
than bees do; and their cycle- 
psychology was extremely well 
worked out. The Strange And Ter- 
rible Secret really is, and its sus- 
pense is built up masterfully to a 
blockbuster single-word resolution 
that left me gasping with relief. 
Throughout, Niven & Pournelle 
display a positive genius for infus- 
ing time-honored ingredients with 
new life and vitality. I found Mote 
delightful, superior in every way to 
its honored forebears — why, the 
science in it won’t be hilariously 
out-of-date for years! 

Thanks to Larry and Jerry, “they 
don’t write ’em like they used to’’ 
is no longer only irrelevant — it’s un- 
true. You can’t keep a good sub- 
genre down.

Ursula K. LeGuin’s The Dispos- 
sessed is one of those unique books 
that should satisfy just about every- 
body. In fact, it seems to have done 
that very thing. It scored the Nebula 
in a year of stiff competition; by the 
time you read this it may very well 
have copped the Hugo over in Mel- 
bourne; and my Aunt Euphonia, 
who reads nothing but the TV 
Guide these days, tells me it looks 
just lovely on the coffee table. 

Ms. LeGuin’s protagonist is 
Shevek, a man who in the words of 
Leon Russell is 'trying to stay alive 
and keep his sideburns too. A 
physicist so gifted that hardly any- 
one can understand his field of 
study, Shevek hails from Anarres, 
an isolationist planet settled several 
generations ago (by colonists from 
the mother world Urras) as an ex- 
perimental ‘ ‘anarchist-socialist’ ’ 
utopia. Life is hard on Annares, and 
the anarchist bureaucracy (!) does 
not encourage physics so abstruse 
that it approaches philosophy — as 
Mark Twain said, this butters no 
parsnips. So Shevek obtains permis- 
sion to vist Urras, a capitalist world 
where the spirit of scientific inquiry 
seems to have more room to grow. 
The results shouldn’t surprise any of 
you hardened cynics, but Shevek’s 
solution forms a delightful surprise, 
science’s perfect answer to a war- 
like race demanding instant mira- 
cles. They get a genuine 
miracle — which is not what they 
wanted. 

All that is plot, however. The 

134 



story is a the tragedy of a man who, 
because he is a human being rather 
than a camp follower, finds that he 
is truly dispossessed, with no direc- 
tion home. True freedom, Shevek 
learns, is only available to those 
who have learned not to ask too 
many questions. His story and his 
character are drawn with superb 
skill by Ms. LeGuin, as are those of 
Shevek’s wife and all the characters 
in the work if it comes to that. As I 
began Dispossessed, I was furious 
with Ms. LeGuin for allowing her 
parable, “The Ones Who Walk Away 
From Ornelas,” to take the Short 
Story Hugo from George Martin’s 
magnificent “With Morning Comes 
Mistfall.” 

But I’ve provisionally decided to 
forgive her on the strength of this 
book. 

* * * 

Onward. I’m having fun this 
month: I liked virtually everything I 
read (which indicates only that I 
was selective in my reading. Maybe 
next month I’ll have an entire col- 
umn of dissected turkeys for you). 

Born With The Dead by Robert 
Silverberg was a particular favorite. 
Now this is a paradoxical saying. 
“Bom With The Dead,” the first of 
the three novellas (“ . about the 
spirit of Man,” says the subtitle) I 
did not finish; in fact I stopped 
reading after about ten pages, and 
have not reconsidered. The second, 
“Thomas The Proclaimer,” held 



GALAXY 




my attention and interest through- 
out, but its theme finally seemed to 
be, “God Himself couldn’t help us 
now, if He literally wrote in the 
sky,’’ which I reject outright (I be- 
lieve this story appeared with stories 
by Gordon Dickson and someone 
else in a theme antho about “What 
If the Earth Stood Still for 24 Hours?’ ’ 
but I can’t name it or its editor. 
Being the only fan in Nova Scotia 
makes it hard to maintain Reviewer’s 
Omniscience — I have only my 
own brain to tap). 

But the third novella, “Going,” 
is just so achingly superb as to be 
worth even the larcenous two bucks 
Vintage gets for a book these days. 
It concerns a man caught at the 
point between living and dying, 
seeking a valid reason to do either, 
and it is purely peachy. To Say any 
more would spoil it — ^go read the 
thing. 

You know, it’s a funny thing 
about Silverbob — whether you like a 
given story of his or not, you can’t 
help but notice that he invariably 
writes about real stuff — you know, 
death, pain, love, life, like that. 
Courageous writer. In “Going,” it 
really pays off. 

* ★ * 

I spoke a moment ago of “Re- 
viewer’s Omniscience,” and the 
difficulty of preserving the said 
front with no fan friends around to 
brain-pick. Last month, I actually 
reviewed a Poul Anderson collec- 



tion, Homeward And Beyond, with- 
out mentioning that “Goat Song,” 
therein contained, won the Hugo for 
Best Novelette in 1973. There was 
no memory-jogging mention in the 
book, mind you, but I know I’ll get 
letters just the same. 

The only way to make it up to 
you and to Poul is to mutually en- 
rich you by next putting in the spot- 
light The Book of Poul Anderson. It 
appeared in 1974 as a hardcover 
under the Chilton label as The Many 
Worlds Of. , edited by Roger 
Elwood (who doesn’t get cover cred- 
it on this edition), and it has now 
become the latest (and one of the 
better) additions to DAW’s Book 
Of .. series. 

Of the stories contained, “Queen 
of Air And Darkness” is clearly a 
gem; “Epilogue” is so stinking 
good that I can’t imagine why it 
didn’t cop the 1963 Hugo when it 
ran in Analog thirteen years ago; 
“The Longest Voyage” is a beauti- 
ful example of what a great yarn 
can be made from a cliched plot; 
“The Sheriff Of Canyon Gulch” 
(written in collaboration with Gordy 
Dickson) is so sidesplittingly funny 
as to prove that good drinking bud- 
dies make good writing buddies 
(how about that, Larry and Jerry?); 
and Sandra Miesel’s essay “Chal- 
lenge And Response” is a thought- 
ful and incisive overview of the 
body of PouTs work, reprinted from 
Riverside Quarterly. 

Now, on the other hand, “To- 
morrow’s Children,” Poul’s first 



BOOKSHELF 



135 




published story, reads like it; the 
admittedly great “Journey’s End” 
has been overanthologized and then 
some; Patrick McGuire’s critical es- 
say, “Her Strongest Enchantments 
Failing,” is too damn long and not 
a patch on Miesel’s; “Day of Burn- 
ing” is a Falkayn/Adzel/Chee Lan 
story (i.e. space opera) and not very 
good compared to some in that 
series; and “A World Named 
Cleopatra,” billed by DAW as “a 
story written just for this book 
alone,” is in fact not a story at all, 
but merely a description in depth 
(with no characters or plot 
whasoever) of A World Named 
Cleopatra on which a story might 
have been set. This last in particular 
leaves me feeling ripped off — 
Cleopatra, as exhaustively described 
(i.e. created) could have hosted a 
damn fine story, and I didn’t get it. 
Dammit, I’d been specifically prom- 
ised quote a story end quote, and it 
makes me salty. 

But there you go — a collection 
with some supreme high spots, 
some just good stuff, and a little bit 
of mediocre. What more can you 
ask from a single-author collection 
in these troubled times? 

If I forgot to include any award 
citations this time, you know what 
to do with them. 

★ ★ ★ 

Another single-author collection! 
You mean I have to find another 
variation on “some were good, 

136 



some were bad, some were so-so” 
(the utterly inevitable comment for 
any collection at all)? I think what 
I’m going to start doing with collec- 
tions is give them percentile scores 
based on number-I-liked against 
total-number-offered (on that basis 
Foul’s collection above gets a 65%; 
a slight minus on “Journey’s End” 
for overfamiliarity being more than 
outweighed by a large bonus for 
“Epilogue”). 

Okay then: Caution! Inflammable 
(my mama told me to be wary of 
books with an exclamation point in 
the title), by Thomas N. Scortia, 
gets a fat 45%. Out of twenty 
stories, I found nine worth recom- 
mending. Of these, “Sea Change,” 
“When You Hear The Tone,” The 
Worm In The Rose,” “Woman’s 
Rib,” and “The Bomb In The 
Bathtub” were outstanding, the lat- 
ter being a hilarious old favorite of 
mine which first saw print in 
Galaxy in 1957. I just wish you 
didn’t have to wade through the rest 
to get to ’em. Oh, most of the rest 
are at least inoffensive, but I can’t 
even say that about the title story, 
“Gee Wurlitzer! It’s A Dad!” {two 
exclamations in a single title is the 
kiss of certain death), “Old, Old 
Death In New, New Venice,” and 
“The Weariest River.” 

Thomas Scortia may be familiar 
to you as the man who, with Frank 
Robinson, wrote The Glass Inferno, 
an exploitation of the current disas- 
ter craze that became the movie The 
Towering Inferno. Give you an 

GALAXY 




idea? The stories I disliked seemed 
to . lack the very quality which Ted 
Sturgeon, in his introduction, calls 
Scortia’s particular virtue: caring. 
Some stories bore out Ted’s claim: 
in “When You Hear the Tone” in 
particular, Scortia obviously cares 
deeply (and makes you care) for a 
basically unlovable character. But 
he seems to do it as a parlor trick; 
in some stories his characters seem 
to arouse only his mild contempt, 
and in others even that is too strong 
a term. 

* # * 

Okay, time for a labor of love. 
There’s time enough for love, isn’t 
there? 

Which should be enough hint. 
The love in question is mine for 
Robert A. Heinlein, who first instil- 
led in me (at age five) an abiding 
love for SF which has made my life 
the reeling farrago it is today. He 
did so with an astounding (pun in- 
tended) series of what have come to 
be known as Heinlein Juveniles: SF 
for young readers. One of Ace’s 
great coups in the last five years has 
been to acquire title to these magni- 
ficent classics, and they’re reprint- 
ing them at a rate of one a month 
until they run out — which could 
take awhile. 

I had the great fortune to meet 
Mr. Heinlein at the last Nebula af- 
fair (at which the Grandmaster 
Nebula was created specifically to 
honor his lifetime contribution to 



the SF genre), and the great honor 
to converse with (read: listen to) 
him for nearly half an hour. During 
that time he explained to me the 
philosophy behind the Juveniles: 
“write an ordinary SF novel as well 
as you know how — then cut the 
sex.” He explained that kids hate 
being talked down to as much as if 
not more than grown-ups — and I 
suddenly began to understand why I 
had fallen so deeply in love with 
him at an early age. 

So let me call your attention to 
the two Ace reprints I’ve received 
so far. Have Space Suit — Will 
Travel and Between Planets. I 
thought I was familiar with both, 
but re-reading proved me wrong: 
they’re better than I remembered. 

Space Suit is handicapped as 
much by its title as by the Juvenile 
label/stigma, but it is clearly the 
superior of the two. In depth of 
characterization, plausibility, color, 
adventure, scope and science con- 
tent it is the equal of anything the 
Master ever wrote, and The Mother 
Thing (a Vegan cop) is one of the 
most fascinating and unforgettable 
characters in all literature. The pro- 
tagonist is Kip Russell, a high- 
school senior who wins a used 
space suit as consolation prize in a 
soap contest (he was hoping to win 
a trip to the Moon) and ends up in 
the Lesser Magellanic Cloud; and 
the theme is that luck is a matter of 
careful preparation and skull-sweat. 

Between Planets is just a bit 
lighter on characterization, and the 



BOOKSHELF 



137 




Secret Organization of Good Guys 
we meet at the end is some 
unconvincing — but there’s action 
and adventure aplenty. Again, one 
of the meatiest characters is an 
alien — this time a dragon with a 
Cockney accent named Sir Isaap 
Newton (the dragon, not the ac- 
cent), who gets tiddly on maple 
syrup. The story centers around the 
maturation-process of Don Harvey, 
who, embroiled in events beyond 
his comprehension or control (the 
Revolt of Venus) is nevertheless 
able to consistently choose right ac- 
tion with insufficient data by fol- 
lowing his heart — something I sin- 
cerely believe can be done. 

I heartily recommend ’em both, 
with a slight edge to Space Suit be- 
cause the villains were much more 
chillingly scary. In all fairness I 
must mention that the cover paint- 
ings for both (and. I’m dismally 
afraid, for the whole series) by Steele 
Savage just plain suck, in every imag- 
inable aspect but particularly as 
regards accuracy (scientific and textu- 
al). 

If you’re a newcomer to SF, or if 
you missed these somehow, go back 
and, check ’em out. They’re part of 
the foundation of the greatest repu- 
tation in the business. And consider- 
ing that the run of the mill goes for 
a buck and a half nowadays, these 
are a terrific bargain at $1.25.

A bunch of minireviews this 



month. Been that kinda month. 

Pluribus by Michael Kurland — an 
After The Collapse novel. Nothing 
wrong with that: I’m writing one 
myself right now (for Berkely, and 
hopefully Putnam). This ambled 
along pleasantly, sometimes hilari- 
ously, keeping my interest — but it 
didn’t seem to have gotten any- 
where when I reached the end. Kur- 
land won the mystery writers’ Edgar 
for A Plague of Spies awhile back, 
and writes well, but he needed a 
theme. I like old Mordecai the 
Magician, but he was an easy 
character to draw, and he didn’t 
seem to do much except survive. So 
did the horse that pulled his wagon. 

The Swarm by Arthur Herzog — 
another of those mainstream SF at- 
tempts, with a plot out of the crack- 
erjacks box and cookie-cutter 
characters. In the spavined tradition 
of Hitchcock’s The Birds, Herzog 
gives us the bees. Giant Swarms Of 
Killer Bees Threaten New York — 
oh God, why hast thou forsaken 
me, thy humble reviewer? 

I must admit Herzog did his 
homework — a lot of research went 
into Swarm (this passes as “science 
content’’). I must also admit that 
for a week after finishing it, I 
jumped ten feet in the air every 
time a bee flew past the outhouse, 
so it manifestly works as a chiller. 
But as a novel, as an SF novel, it’s 
a dismal flop. 

Science Past — Science Future by 
Isaac Asimov — the good doctor’s {is 
he a good doctor? Does he do 



138 



GALAXY 




house-calls?) 160 th published work 
(Good Christ!), bearing out the dust 
jacket’s contention that “Dr. 
Asimov may himself be the solution 
to the energy crisis.” This book is a 
collection of short-short science-

this up on the stands out of amused 
curiousity, but I’m glad it was 
Galaxy's money I spent on it. Pfeh. 
The funniest thing about it is the

back cover, and you can have that 
for free. I’m not sure, but I believe 
I heard somewhere that this was 
ghosted by Philip Jose Farmer [It 
was. — Ed.] but perhaps I have my 
hoaxes mixed, and I’d hate to pin 
this on anybody without proof. The

Jimmy williams had been a cynic 
for as many of his thirteen years as 
he could remember. 

Not that most children aren’t bom 
with a healthy and functional 
“Built-In Shit Detector,” the sine 
qua non of cynicism in its purest 
form. But by the time they reach 
puberty, most, children have been 
successfully trained in self-deception 
by their elders, and have learned 
that although a B.l.S.D. can never 
be shut off, it can be easily ignored 
with the aid of certain liquids, va- 
pors and pills. 

Jimmy, however, was plenty 
tough. It would be years before the 
bitter pain of being a one-eyed man 
in the country of the blind suc- 
ceeded in blinding his eyes, gagging 
his mouth, and mortally wounding 
his self-respect. At the moment, the 
impassioned words of a larger-than- 
life senatorial candidate on the 
Screen filled him with an amused 
contempt. 

“DEMOCRACY,” boomed the 
phosphor-dot phantom, “IS RUN 
BY ALL, YET RUN DOWN BY 
MANY. THE SUBLIMELY OB- 
VIOUS TRUTH THAT ALL MEN 
ARE CREATED EQUAL APPAR- 
ENTLY IS NOT OBVIOUS 
ENOUGH FOR SOME. SEEING 
THEMSELVES AS A SORT OF 
POLITICAL ELITE, THESE AR- 
ROGANT ARTISTS OF ANAR- 
CHY WOULD PLACE THEM- 
SELVES AND THEIR OWN 
OPINIONS ABOVE THE SACRED 
WILL OF THE PEOPLE, THE 



VIRILE, DRIVING FORCE 
WHICH DISTILLED THIS GREAT 
NATION OF OURS FROM THE 
CHAOS WHICH HAD GONE BE- 
FORE. AS FOR ...” Jimmy 
turned down the volume. “. my- 
self, 1 can see no reason why I 
should be other than honored and 
proud to take the will of the people 
for my own, and subordinate my 
desires to those of the body politic. 
Indeed, it would be a rare ...” 

Jimmy’s amusement and con- 
tempt were gradually giving way to 
an impatient irritability. The politi- 
cian had ceased to be funny; was 
becoming odious. 

“Screw it,” he said aloud, and 
the Screen vanished, was replaced 
by the far wall of Jimmy’s bed- 
room. He regarded the wall for a 
moment, wishing for the thousandth 
time that he could put up some sort 
of poster-type decoration on its 
blank grey surface without having 
to get up and remove the stuff every 
time he wanted to use the Screen. 
He had heard that next year’s model 
would not be subject to molecular dis- 
tortion as was this one — but he had 
also heard that Prosperity was Just 
Around the Corner. Jimmy believed 
only in what he could see — and 
damned little of that. 

Right now, Jimmy wanted des- 
perately to believe that his father 
would be coming home tonight. 
Sergeant William’s Tac Squad had 
been called up at dawn to assist in 
quelling a riot in the Wyandanch 
Ghetto, involving some two or three 



141 




thousand people, and an hour’s 
monitoring of the newscasts had 
brought Jimmy nothing with any 
more calories than the democracy- 
loving politician. 

That was bad. 

Jimmy loved his father quite a 
bit, a fact which irritated him im- 
mensely whenever he became con- 
sciously aware of it. It annoyed him 
to love someone who was quite 
capable of ending an argument 
with, “There is no reason. Do it 
my way,’’ particularly because ex- 
perience had shown him that when 
his father said that, he nearly al- 
ways turned out to be right. A flat 
was galling; a correct and prudent 
fiat was maddening. 

Perhaps what annoyed him the 
most, however, was that his father 
would accept, at times, the fiats of 
others — which seemed to Jimmy a 
kind of betrayal. The time Sgt. Wil- 
liams had knuckled under to a 
meddling neighbor and a Town 
Zoning Board, obeying the order of 
the latter to tear down Jimmy’s 
“nonconforming’’ tree-house, had 
nearly destroyed their relationship. 
The boy still did not understand his 
father’s concept of duty, but on the 
night six months later when he had 
come home to find his father 
sprawled whitefaced on the living- 
room carpet, sobbing to Jimmy’s 
inother of the slaughter he had done 
that day in society’s name, Jimmy 
had learned that whatever the nature 
of this weakness, it was beyond his 
father’s ability to fight. 

142 



Jimmy was determined to be 
tougher. Society gave him a pain 
behind the lap. 

Democracy, he thought,' remem- 
bering the politician who had an- 
noyed him. How can something 
sound so good and work out so 
lame? The lad had recognized the 
politician’s words as bullshit by 
their sound alone, but he could not 
have answered them as arguments. 
He had audited a reasonable number 
of Eyecon courses for a boy of his 
age, but he was too young to take 
Political Rhetoric just yet, and he 
had never cared enough to ask his 
father to help him get a waiver. 

But the challenge appealed to him 
in his present state of mind. 

Let's see, Jimmy thought. First 
he talked about how all men are 
created equal. 

That was a tricky one. Jimmy 
himself had some reason to believe 
that all men might be in fact created 
equal. Had he not himself been 
classified, at the age of three, as an 
“innate underachiever’’ by the 
Eyecon psychologists? And had he 
not, under the stimulus of his 
father’s meaty right hand, gone on 
to achieve Magna Cum Laude status 
in his fourth, fifth and sixth years? 
“They tried to tell me you wasn’t 
as good as everybody else,’’ his 
father had whispered savagely to 
him once, when he was thought too 
young to understand, “but I say 
that’s crap. Everybody gets the 
same chance to make something of 
themselves, and by God we’re 

GALAXY 




gonna prove it to ’em, you and 
me. 

And yet Jimmy also remembered 
his father saying once, “What I do 
for my keep is my business, kid. 
What you do for your keep is mow 
the lawn. What do you think this 
family is, anyway, a democracy?” 

Jimmy had been taking an 
Eyecon Sociology course at the 
time, and he had asked his real pro- 
fessor about his father’s words dur- 
ing the question and answer period. 
The little grey man on the screen 
had closed his eyes and said 
tonelessly, “Democracy is not a fea- 
sible form of government for a social 
group as small as the family. In a 
group of that size a single indi- 
vidual becomes a special-interest 
group — any two of them can be- 
come an unbeatable axis. It is in the 
vast numbers of people which 
characterize a viable democracy that 
individual interests and inadequacies 
cancel out, and the common good 
can ...” But at that point question 
and answer period ended, and the 
real professor’s face was supplanted 
by the more familiar cartoon profes- 
sor who couldn’t hear you. 

Now that Jimmy came to think of 
it, however, Eyecon had a sort of 
vested interest in democracy. The 
leap of companies like Eyeball Con- 
solidated and Telemat from cable 
television franchises to complete in- 
formation networks had been dupli- 
cated in the socialist countries of 
the world, but it had taken the free 
enterprise systems of America and 



Japan to create them in the first 
place. Their vast Screen empires 
and their shotgunning diversification 
had been sparked by competition, 
and only in a democracy is big-time 
competition open to more than a 
chosen few. 

Perhaps it was no wonder that the 
real professor, one of the lucky few 
who had landed a job with a Screen 
company when the bottom fell out 
of the education market, was an 
ajtologist for democracy. 

The hell with it, Jimmy thought. 
I'll see if there’s anything on the 
news now. He was getting really 
worried about his father. 

”... quality listing is given as 
highly unsatisfactory, so be sure 
to bring your mask along if you go 
outside today. Our weather- watch 
also informs us that today’s radia- 
tion level readings throughout the 
tri-city area are ‘no cause for 
alarm,’ thanks to the valiant efforts 
of the Atomic Energy Commission’s 
emergency crews. And now for a 
full report here is Snaker De Landro 
from Gardiner’s Island.” 

The moon-faced man on the wall 
was replaced by a lean, ascetic- 
looking man with straggly black 
hair and a goatee. 

“Right, Wally. ‘Valiant efforts’ 
ain’t no lie at all; I mean, these 
guys are really together out here, 
you know? The man says all you 
people on the other side of the 
Screen can pretty much walk around 
outside in street clothes if you want 
to, as long as the wind’s northeast. 



“AMBIGUOUS ORACLE" 



143 




And when it isn’t, light body armor 
should be more than adequate. 

“Look, lemme lay some 
background on ya, case ya forgot, 
all right? Maybe you remember the 
big hassle LILCo first had when 
they tried to go atomic, that 
Shoreham deal? They tried to tell 
everybody that a nuclear power 
plant on Long Island Sound was 
harmless t’the ecology. Get bent, 
we said, you and me, but before 
long it started to look like they was 
right when they said they couldn’t 
keep our air-conditioners and 
Screens working without some big-ass 
plant someplace. So we give ’em 
Gardiner’s Island, and everybody’s 
happy except maybe Gardiner, 
right? Now look what happens. 
Place is so close to the mainland 
you could row out there, and they 
can’t run a power-line that don’t 
break. Governor fails and BLOOIE! 

“Well, what I want to know is 
when do I get my air-conditioning 
back? I mean, you people out there 
on the other side got — ’ ’ 

“Screw it,’’ said Jimmy angrily, 
and Snaker De Landro was exor- 
cised. If all men are created equal, 
how come Eyecon’s House-Hippie 
Newsman is such an idiot? 

Jimmy had seen Telemat’s House 
Hippie, at the house of a friend 
whose parents subscribed to Eye- 
con’s Japanese rival, and he hadn’t 
sounded like a case of terminal 
brain damage. Perhaps that really 
was one of the advantages of a 
democracy, with the custard-heads 

144 



being canceled out in the long run. 
In a totalitarian government, one 
idiot with a bent for power- 
collection could take over and rule 
for a lifetime — at least Jimmy’s 
country shuffled the idiots every 
few years. 

Why then did the system still 
seem to work so poorly? 

Jimmy decided to ask the Brain. 

“Brain?” he said. 

The word “CODE” appeared on 
the Screen wall, with a question 
mark a second later. 

Jimmy frowned. Tapping the 
brain required a surcharge authoriza- 
tion, and Jimmy’s father was not 
aware that he knew the 
authorization-code . 

He decided to settle that problem 
when the bill came. 

“Wiliams 245T-Bridgeport 77- 
R . .” he checked the calendar, 
“ . 36D.” 

“WAITING,” said the wall in 
foot-high computerscript. 

“Input idiomatic English — same 
response mode,” said Jimmy. That 
would keep it simple enough for 
him to understand. 

“WAITING,” the wall repeated. 
Eyecon’s brain was flexible indeed, 
constituting one of the firm’s 
biggest selling-points. To tap into 
the Eyecon grid was to gain access 
to a computer which was the equal 
of MENTOR in Washington, capa- 
ble of accepting programs in nearly 
any known language, human or 
computer. The Eyecon System 
didn’t just bring you entertainment 

GALAXY 




and present you with shopping op- 
tions at home or guard the house 
while you were elsewhere, it 
answered your questions for you, 
with the best answers available at 
the moment. Certain categories, of 
course, were restricted, and if the 
fail-safes caught a schoolboy tap- 
ping the brain for homework 
answers they doubled the bill for 
the course (“ . right in the small 
print, sir, and you must agree it is 
for your own protection . .”), but 
any legitimate query would be hon- 
ored. 

“Computer,” said Jimmy ritual- 
ly, “what, if anything, is inherently 
wrong with the democratic system 
of governing people?” 

The computer answered. 

Jimmy frowned. Must be too 
many ambiguities to phrase it right 
in English he thought. Damn. Jim- 
my’s Fortran was not what it 
perhaps should have been. 

But he tried just the same, using 
the instruction manual bolted to the 
Screen’s operations console by his 
bed. The vocabulary barely included 
enough concepts to make his query 
intelligible; at least he would have 
the luxury of an idiomatic reply. 

The second answer, being the 
same, pleased him no more than the 
first. He must be screwing up. 

The hell with it, Jimmy thought, 
and switched to news so impatiently 
that he forgot to hit the “Clear” 
switch for the Brain first. A news- 
caster’s excited features superim- 
posed themselves over the Brain’s 



computerscript answer, obscuring it. 
Jimmy sat up — this was it. 

”... seen anything like it here 
at the Wyandanch Public Housing 
Complex. Last week’s events pale 
into insignificance before the con- 
centrated violence and savagery of 
this bitter confrontation. The body 
count so far as we can determine 
here in* the field has already gone 
well above the previous record of 
213, with the majority of 
them . uh . minority mem- 
bers. Heavier police firepower 
seems to have carried the day. 

“But what the rioters lack in ar- 
mament they make up for in feroci- 
ty. Of the 97 officers killed here to- 
day, 34 were literally tom to pieces 
when they were surprised outside 
the Interdicted Zone by a faction of 
radicals. Radical charges of police 
brutality are unverified at this time. 

“Those interested in a casualty 
readout should activate channel 37, 
19 or for those of you in outlying 
areas, channel 2K. Radical casual- 
ties on the left ...” the ’caster 
grinned sardonically, ”... and 
police casualties on the right.” 

Jimmy hastily slapped the 2K 
switch. The newscast shrunk in- 
ward, and lists of names began to 
march up the wall on either side of 
it. Tom to pieces! 

His ears roared as the right hand 
list ended, scuttling up into the ceil- 
ing without having named his 
father. The roar eventually 
dopplered down into the ‘caster’s 
voice, calmer now. 



"AMBIGUOUS ORACLE" 



145 




“ at hand is, of course, dif- 
ficult to say at this time. The radi- 
cals, as usual, claim a moral vic- 
tory, but it seems as if the central 
issue of today’s demonstration, a 
step-up in garbage pickup to bi- 
weekly, will be denied them all the 
same. Housing Administrator Blasi 
has vowed ‘never to knuckle under 
to armed dissent unless it should be 
in the interests of the Federal Public 
Housing Program.’ So it seems 
there’ll be no joy in the Wyandanch 
toni . .” 

The door of Jimmy’s room 
opened; Sgt. Williams stood in the 
doorway, his uniform jacket unbut- 
toned and bloody. Jimmy started to 
kill the Screen, barely remembering 
in time to use his alternate cue. 
“Cease,” he said, and the newscast 
ceased. 

“Evening, son,” said Sgt. Wil- 
liams wearily. “How’s it going on 
the home front?” 

“Okay, Pop. How’d it go to- 
day?” 

“Pretty rough. Kelly — you re- 
member him? — caught a slug. Took 
his face clean off.” Sgt. Williams 
looked at his boots, rubbed the 
doorframe as though it were his 
wife’s shoulder. “When I think of 
what we went through, to keep a 
couple of politicians from losing 
face . .’’ He shook his head. 
“But, I guess we gotta protect and 
preserve society, even the screwy 
parts, eh, Jimbo?” 

“Guess so. Pop.” 

Sgt. Williams sighed, looked 

146 



around the room. “What’s this? 
Playing with the brain?” 

Jimmy realized suddenly that the 
computer’s last answer was waiting 
there on the wall for him to hit the 
“clear” switch, and breathed a 
blasphemy. Caught red-handed! 

“Uh . yeah. Pop. I was 
just . fooling around.” He 
waited for the explosion, already 
wondering what his punishment 
would be. 

But the weary man in the door- 
way didn’t seem to have an explo- 
sion in him. “Don’t do that without 
asking, Jimmy. It’s okay, I can see 
by the answer you got that you 
didn’t cost us any money — no 
charge for nulls. But next time you 
might run up quite a bill, and your 
allowance won’t cover it. Don’t let 
it happen again, all right?” 

He turned and walked from the 
room, but his muffled “Good 
night,” got no response from Jim- 
my, for Jimmy had just realized in 
a blinding flash that his father was 
wrong, that they would get a bill 
for his questioning of the computer 
after all. The Brain had not refused 
to answer, it had simply answered 
as correctly and concisely as it 
knew how. 

For Jimmy had asked it: 

“What is wrong with the democ- 
ratic form of government?” 

And the Brain, apparently con- 
sidering computerman’s slang 
as idiomatic, had answered; 
“G.I.G.O.” — that is, “garbage in, 
garbage out.” ★

GETTING 

AWAY 



There were soft-bodied creatures 
in endless variety and profusion on 
the bottom, and tentacled shellfish, 
odd orange scorpions, trilobites, 
grotesque wrigglers that looked like 
armored centipedes, an occasional 
fish, all grim mouth and dull eyes 
peering out of bone-rimmed sock- 
ets. There were clumps of pallid 
plants with segmented stems, rising 
like columns from the mud to sup- 
port the rippling, translucent ceil- 
ing of the pond. Beyond the ceiling 
was a fuzzy-edged sun. 

Devonian dreams. I woke up and 
went under again, and this time 
there were blue glacial cliffs on the 
horizon. Much closer, there was the 
stench of tar and decaying glesh. 
The setting sun made molten silver 
of the rain water standing on the 
surfaces of the tar pools. Irregular 
lumps lay in some of the pools. 
Here and there could be seen a 
curved tusk; a not unrecognizably 
decomposed forepaw with long, 
hooked claws; a partially consumed 
hump of a half-submerged bison. 
Condors and jackals were 
everywhere, and I was with them. 



Pleistocene images. I woke up 
and got out of bed. It was my day 
to fix breakfast. 

This is my one real luxury, you 
understand — this journal, these pre- 
cious sheets of paper. I indulged 
myself last week and paid through 
the nose for a hardbound book of 
blank pages. Two hundred sheets of 
paper, four hundred sides on which 
to record my every vagrant thought. 
Paper for which I have no nobler 
purpose in mind than Dear Diary- 
ing. 

Welcome to page 2 of The Book 
Of Bruce Holt, who’ll probably be 
dead before he gets close to page 
400.

“Why always dinosaurs and 
things like that?” asks Carol, the 
woman with whom I have been liv- 
ing. “And why always poems about 
‘the moment of extinction,’ as you 
put it here?” 

I am munching my toast and sip- 
ping my tepid soyva. Carol is lean- 
ing against the kitchenette’s disposal

unit, fanning herself with the carbon 
slate I use for Hrst drafts and notes. 

“That’s what I see,’’ I tell her. 
“Dinosaurs and things like that. 
That’s what comes to me.’’ 

“It’s all so damned depressing. 
You’re getting that way in your 
stories, too.” 

“It’s a natural reaction against 
the pap I write for television.” 

“That pap keeps food on the ta- 
ble.” 

I make a short, sharp chuckling 
noise — I am not so old that I do not 
remember real bread, real coffee — 
and force down the last of my 
breakfast, then fish in my shirt pock- 
et for a cigarette. That last remark 
of Carol’s has gotten to me, since 
it’s true. My stories are fitful sell- 
ers. Too depressing for most 
people. Television keeps me going, 
and television wants optimism. Or, 
at the very least, sheer escapism. 
Old Jack Woodford’s formula for 
commercial fiction is a timeless 
one. Boy Meets Girl, Girl Gets Boy 
Into Pickle, Boy Gets Pickle Into 
Girl. 

“I’m going downtown today,” I 
say after a while. “Do you want me 
to pick up anything for you?” 

Carol shakes her head slowly. “I 
can’t think of anything. I may try to 
get into the commissary while 
you’re out. I could make dinner to- 
night.” 

“It’s my day to cook.” 

“It’ll give me something to do.” 
“Finished reading your book?” 
She uses her fingernail to trace a 
150 



line across the bottom of the carbon 
slate. “1 don’t care for it much. 
Camus depresses me the same way 
you do.” 

“Always nice to hear that I’ve 
made it into Camus’ league.” I take 
my first long puff on the cigarette 
and wonder what in hell they’ve 
begun using to cut the tobacco. 
“Come on, Carol, what would you 
prefer that I wrote poems about? 
Babbling brooks and blue skies? 
None left, in the event it’s escaped 
your notice.” 

“Don’t be nasty, Bruce. And 
there aren’t any dinosaurs left, 
either, so touche to you.” 

I let the matter drop, because the 
power is suddenly uncoiling in the 
back of my skull, and I’m sliding 
away from her, into the first avail- 
able mind: some woman named Sha- 
ron Kraft, who lives in the heart of 
the Nashville metroplex, in an 
apartment even smaller than ours. 
It’s extremely cold in Sharon 
Kraft’s room, and the single dirty 
window is frosted over on the out- 
side. I, sweltering in August heat, 
have gone to her at the height of 
some recent winter. I didn’t know 
Sharon Kraft before this moment, 
didn’t know of her, and all I get 
from her during the four or five 
seconds that I’m in her is the usual 
stuff, flashes about food and 
money. Couched in leaden anxiety. 

Carol slaps the carbon slate down 
on the table before me. “Don’t do 
that when I’m talking to you!” 

I snap out of it, rescue the slate 

GALAXY 




from the toast crumbs, mutter an 
apology. 

“You’re always retreating from 
me like that!’’ Carol goes on, her 
voice rising up the scale. “That’s 
all you ever use it for, isn’t it? 
Things get touchy, and you go fly- 
ing away into your little world for 
the duration.’’ 

I am trying not to let her irrita- 
tion infect me. It’s too hot for ar- 
guments. I offer her a drag off my 
cigarette. She shakes her head ve- 
hemently. 

“Look,” I say, forcing myself to 
speak calmly, soothingly, “I didn’t 
ask for it. It just happened. I’m 
stuck with it, Carol.” 

“Stuck with it! You make it 
sound like a clubfoot!” 

“Carol, honey, I have to get 
along with it the best 1 can.” 

“Then why don’t you use it to 
make things better for us?” 

“What do you want me to do? 
Go back and find out where Captain 
Kidd buried his loot?” 

“I don’t care what you do, but 
do something . ’ ’ 

Carol has begun pacing back and 
forth in the kitchenette, three steps 
that way, three steps back. When 
she realizes that I’m not going to 
say another word, that I have no in- 
tention of scrapping with her, she 
stalks out of the kitchenette and 
wanders in a loose circle around the 
apartment’s main room, touching 
the spines of my little library of tat- 
tered paperbounds, glaring at the 
chipped plastic chessmen (still 

GEHING AWAY 



locked in last week’s Mexican 
stand-off). And I sit trying to think 
of something to say which might re- 
store me to her good graces. 

But the rent is due next week, 
and my check from the studio is 
late, and she’s bored and feels use- 
less because she can’t find a job, 
and I am convenient to blame, be- 
cause I have the power. I have the 
extra Something that most people 
don’t have. I have the gift. And it 
isn’t doing us any good. And 
so. 

And so I give up and carefully 
snuff out the cigarette in a clay 
ashtray, then deposit the tobacco 
from the butt in a Mason jar half- 
filled with previous savings. The 
best I can do is stay out of Carol’s 
way for a while. 

Still, I can’t help being a little 
annoyed. We’ve been through this 
before, and you’d think that by now 
Carol would have accepted my limi- 
tations. How many times do I have 
to tell her that I can’t make the 
extra Something do anything? 

It comes. It goes. I have no con- 
trol over it, none at all. Time 
snatches me out of my own head 
and takes me where it will. I can 
never say where I’m liable to end 
up, and, once there, I can’t do any- 
thing except observe the goings-on 
through the eyes, ears and/or other 
sensory organs of whatever creature 
makes itself available to me. Watch- 
ing trilobites through the eyes of (I 
presume) lungfish is not going to 
make me rich. 

151 




Oh, but I tried. I did try. 

When I first started having these 
chronopathic flashbacks, I dismissed 
them as nightmares and waking 
dreams. Then came the doubts 
about my own sanity, the sessions 
with a psychiatrist, the numbing ter- 
ror of madness. It wasn’t until Dr. 
D. M. Mayes, of the University of 
Texas right here in Austin, issued 
his report that the nature of my 
affliction became obvious. Tem- 
poral dislodgement. Chronopathy. 
How much better I felt once I knew 
the name of my disease. How nice 
to hear that there were dozens like 
me. 

The last I heard, they still didn’t 
understand just how the human 
mind could travel through time. If 
physicists were baffled by the 
mechanics of telepathy, clair- 
voyance and telekinesis, they were 
absolutely infuriated by chronopathy, 
which brazenly refuted much that 
they held dear about the nature of 
Time and Space. But I have my 
own theory to explain why. 

I think it was triggered by de- 
spair. Maybe chronopathy has al- 
ways been latent in people, man- 
ifesting itself on occasion and giv- 
ing rise to conjecture about ghosts 
and reincarnation. But the manifes- 
tations have become more wide- 
spread during the last quarter of this 
century. And I think it’s due to an 
overwhelming sense of hopeless op- 
pression in a worsening environ- 
ment. People lost all faith in the fu- 
ture. Unhappy in the present, they 

152 



longed for the past, ached for it, 
because it always looked rosier, 
simpler, easier. 

Thus were the shackles within the 
human psyche struck off. 

So, anyway, at age thirty-eight, I 
turned out to be chronopathic. 
Learning to live with it wasn’t easy, 
but I’ve managed. I guess. 

Once, I even sought out Mayes 
and offered my services. But he had 
already assembled a team of 
chronopaths, men and women whose 
abilities were finely honed, who 
had all of the necessary paleon-, 
archeo- and anthropological school- 
ing to complement their talents. I 
was untrained. I had no control over 
my power. 

I was, in short, a semi-gifted 
amateur, a layman, a hack writer 
and minimally successful poet to 
boot. 

We appreciate your thinking of us 
in this regard, Mr. Holt, but. 

Not suitable for present needs. 
Terrific. The story of my life. 

★ * * 

Last night, I watched from the 
crowd as Louis XV went under the 
blade. You should have seen the 
expression on his face, dear diary. 
He really did not believe that we’d 
go through with it. Right up to the 
moment that the executioner 
dropped the blade, he refused to ac- 
cept the reality of the situation, and 
then. Just as the blade began to fall, 
I saw him crane his head up as far 
as it would go. I would have sworn 

GALAXY 




that I saw his lips form the words, 
Mon Dieu. 

Ah well. Where did I leave off in 
the continuing saga of Bruce and 
Carol? 

The other day, while I was wait- 
ing for her to get over her mad, I 
put my ancient Olympia portable on 
the table and got to work on the 
latest installment of my TV soap 
opera. I was halfway down the page 
when Carol bumped into something 
and made a lot of unnecessary noise 
on her way to the John. She was. 
I’m certain, deliberately trying to 
provoke me. But I settled back in 
my chair, closed my eyes and felt 
myself leaving again. 

When 1 got there, the sky was 
overcast, and warm rain was fall- 
ing. The low clouds had a faint 
greenish tinge. I crouched in a snug 
hole on the face of a cliff that dropped 
straight down into the sea. My 
niche stank of rotting fish and ex- 
crement, but the stench did not 
cut too sharply. My host’s sense of 
smell seemed atrophied. However, 
even in this murk, its vision was 
exceptional — the only other time I 
had ever experienced such incredi- 
ble clarity of vision was the time I 
rode along with what must have 
been one of the very last eagles. 

The rain ceased by and by. My 
host — no, I — stirred and stretched 
pathetic little hindlegs to restore cir- 
culation, unfurled wings that were 
membraneous and covered with a 
fine down. The wings were braced 
by an enormously elongated digit. I

now knew what, when and probably 
where I was. 

Pterosaur, Cretaceous Period. By 
the inland sea of Kansas, perhaps. 

I waited until the updraft from 
the sea felt right, and then I gently 
kicked away from the face of the 
cliff, dipped, rose and was airborne. 

1 had the sky all to myself. 

Eventually, my host brought us 
lower and skimmed along above the 
waves, watchful of silver shadows 
just below the surface. My long, 
toothless beak dipped in suddenly 
and scooped up a thrashing Fish 
which went down my gullet whole. 

Then my host climbed, still the 
only creature in the sky. The sun 
was starting to slide below the hori- 
zon. I could not escape the feeling 
that this might indeed be the last 
evening of all, that I had happened 
upon the very last of the dragons. I 
had come to the Mesozoic Era 
many times before, I had been Gor- 
gosaurus and Plateosaurus, 1 knew 
my way around in the Age of Di- 
nosaurs. But something was differ- 
ent now. The land, sea and sky 
looked as they had always looked 
on my previous visits to Late Cre- 
taceous times, my host flew on as 
though nothing were strange, but 1 
knew, I knew, that aerial reconnai- 
sance of the land to the east would 
reveal it to be empty of giants. 
There was only my host, gliding si- 
lently toward what I had, in a 
poem, termed “the moment of ex- 
tinction.” It seemed an invasion of 
privacy to remain and witness this 

154 



final pterodactyl’s fall, so I pulled 
away and got on with my typing. 

1 had a severe headache when I 
was finished at the typewriter. Carol 
had subsided to the point where she 
could collapse on the sofa-bed with 
The Stranger. But she was flipping 
the pages angrily. She had noticed 
my unoccupied meat. 

I went over to her and got very 
tender and caressing and so forth, 
and we were back on more or less 
friendly terms after about thirty min- 
utes. We realized that we hadn’t 
had our last falling out about the 
extra Something, but we were all 
cuddly and content for the time be- 
ing, the storm had passed, we could 
look forward to a little peace before 
the subject again reared its head. 

And in such moments I really, 
keenly regret that I am not better 
with my words. The Mesozoic al- 
ways does that to me, makes me 
want to talk to Carol about what it 
was like to have been a young man 
back during the Sixties and earliest 
Seventies, when it looked as though 
there might be hope for humani- 
ty .. when blacks were suddenly 
demanding the right to be people, 
when women were demanding the 
right to be human beings, 
when . when so many different 
voices were being raised, crying out 
for sanity and justice, when there 
were good and noble causes, worthy 
causes, when there was still time 
and the future that has come to pass 
was still a small, gray cloud hang- 
ing low on the horizon, when. 



GALAXY 




When the smell of extinction was 
not in the air. 

But I can’t make it live for Carol. 
She’s too young. She was born after 
things had already gone to hell in a 
hand-basket. She was barely out of 
diapers when California broke up. 
(Goodbye, L.A. You always fasci- 
nated me.) She was just a kid when 
Texas made its abortive attempt to 
divide itself into five separate 
states, and as far as Carol is con- 
cerned, Texas has always been oc- 
cupied by enemy troops. 

Carol came too late, after there 
was no longer any place for hope in 
our lives. And I have never been 
able to explain to her the essential 
difference between the poor dumb 
earnest optimism of my youth and 
the inanely glowing stuff I write for 
TV. 

Carol, Carol, dinosaurs and all 
their brethren were majestic crea- 
tures. How much so, you will never 
be able to understand, because you 
can’t be told about it. You have to 
feel what it was like to be twenty 
meters long and the lord of the 
world. Or to glide on six-meter 
wings above the Kansas Sea. The 
dinosaurs were the most awesome 
things of all time, mountains made 
to walk. And, for all of their cranial 
density, Carol, they were nobler 
monsters than men. When the di- 
nosaurs died, they left a clean 
world. They walked out of the 
world, and it was still full of living 
things. The dinosaurs died out 
gracefully. 

GEHING AWAY 



When we die out, we’ll take the 
whole world with us, one way or 
another. 

* * * 

I have such a mind for trivia. All 
morning long. I’ve been haunted by 
a song which I can’t possibly have 
heard during the past twenty years. 
It’s something from the Sixties, I 
think, something by Bob Dylan. A 
cry of anguish, of disillusionment. 
“Oh, mama, can this really be the 
end, to be stuck inside of Mobile 
with the Memphis blues again?” 

And this, from one of the stan- 
zas: “ ... the ladies treat me kind- 
ly, and they furnish me with tape, 
but deep inside my heart, I know I 
can’t escape.” 

Oh, but I try. 

Today is Friday, Food Day at the 
commissary, and the streets are 
packed. I had to go to the studio. 
Pushed and fought my way to the 
mass-transit stop at the corner, and 
then the steam-bus was twenty min- 
utes late. But it did arrive, and I 
did get a seat up front. It was a 
miserable ride, all the same. My, res- 
pirator has sprung a leak. (God, 
who’d have thought that Austin, 
Texas would ever have really bad 
smog?) The day was a scorcher, 
and everything stank, the bus, the 
streets, the people, the whole city. 
The smell of extinction. 

And so I leaned my head back, 
closed my eyes and got away from 
then as best I could. All is calm, all 
is bright. ★

DIRECTIONS 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

The words WE INVITE LETTERS at the 
end of Directions struck a responsive chord 
this month and so, this letter. 

Your note in your reply to Philip M. Co- 
hen’s letter (“For some reason, subs, have 
increased enormously in the last year or 
so. that, sir, is good news for not only 
Galaxy but for the entire SF field. After IF 
died and Vertex shuddered to a near standstill 
(newsprint/tabloid format), [Vertex has since 
folded. Ed. ], 1 was rather anxious for the SF 
magazine field. But things are looking up, 
particularly with Galaxy. The reason for the 
increase in subs, to Galaxy is simply put; 
Quality editing presenting Quality SF. 

After the era of Fred Pohl, Galaxy and IF 
were, to be charitable, shoddy. However, 
with the advent of your regime. Galaxy has 
moved rapidly toward the top of the SF 
magazine field. You have my heartfelt con- 
gratulations for your fine work. 

Most letters end at this point, but some- 
thing has nagged at me for some time and 
here it is: Why is SF continually placed at 
the bottom of the literary world? 

Years ago (1959 or so) when acquain- 
tances would see me reading Heinleih’s 
Stranger in a Strange Land, I would hear the 
old; “Jeeze! How can you stand to read 
that — space opera-monster junk — (just plain) 



junk — drivel and s-t?’’ I’d grin and tell ’em 
I read it because it was interesting, basically 
well written and, well, it had ideas, concepts 
and settings that mainstream literature just 
did not contain. Sniggering at my juvenile 
tastes, they would saunter off. 

Ten years later the same people were tell- 
ing me about “grokking”, “water brothers” 
and all the new ideas they had just discov- 
ered. I sniggered a bit and read onward. It 
never ceases to astound me how many of the 
“now” and “today” views of the world are 
old hat to us SF readers. Von Daniken? 
Unique? Unusual? Mind boggling? Not a bit 
of it! Most of the concepts presented in that 
mish-mash. Chariots of the Gods were 
explored, dissected and hurled onto the trash 
heap of SF cliche years ago. The “crazy” 
ideas of SF are now being discussed by 
many who would never admit that they had 
ever considered reading that “junk” SF. 
This paradox of general acceptance of old SF 
concepts as new, thrilling ideas while deni- 
grating the field that generated them bothers 
the hell out of me! “Low” form literature 
this SF, but the ideas are neat, just don’t 
admit where they originated! Egad! 

Another point of interest is the continual 
idea-production of SF. Let’s face it, SF 
keeps you interested — in our world (past, 
present and future) and (this is where the 
mainstream is left light years behind) in the 
situations of other worlds, their people, prob- 
lems and culture. The growing popularity 
and acceptance of SF among the general 
readership (those who were mainstreamers 
until they “saw the light”) indicates that the 
human brain has not become totally mired in 
today, we’re still reading beyond our every- 
day world, looking not just for escape, but 
for enlightenment and knowledge. SF does 
aid us in our thinking; I’ve learned more 
about science from reading SF than from 
all the dull science textbooks of my high 
school and college days. Which brings me to 
Dr. A. Meyer’s letter, to wit; Bull! (For the 
most pan.) 

I can agree with his assertion that SF, 
though it can exist happily without literary 
values cannot exist without absolute values 



156 




in part only. SF contains certain absolute 
values which make it SF. But to exist with- 
out literary values? I think not, Dr. Meyer. 
He is horrendously mistaken when he states 
“. .literary elegance is merely gilding re- 
fined gold.” 

Good Grief! Granted, SF does have “ab- 
solute values” (suspension of disbelief, liter- 
ature of ideas, etc.) and to those of us who 
read it regularily, it is refined gold; but to 
say that literary values are unimportant to 
SF — that’s just absurd. 

Science Fiction — that second word is im- 
ponant\ There is good fiction and bad fic- 
tion; there is probably nothing worse than 
bad science fiction. In SF both the science 
and the fiction must be integrated, but both 
must be presented '^ell in order for it to be 
successful. That’s what makes it so challeng- 
ing to write and exciting to read. 

Delaney, Sturgeon, Heinlein, Silverberg, 
Zelazny, Bester, Pohl, Andersen, Le Guin 
(the list is almost endless) all write excellent 
fiction and it makes their science fiction 
move, become real and have meaning. 

Characterization, plotting and the other 
concepts of fiction must be observed if our 
favorite literary form is to remain viable. If 
Dr. Meyer doubts the value of fiction con- 
cepts in SF, I would refer him to Ben Bova’s 
article in the August 1975 Writer “Plot in 
Science Fiction”, an excerpt from his forth- 
coming book Notes to a Science Fiction Writ- 
er. Or he could examine Science Fiction: 
Today and Tomorrow, an entire book, edited 
by Reginald Bretnor, dedicated to the science 
and the fiction in SF. 

The field is becoming more fulfilling dai- 
ly; concepts and techniques are achieving an 
excellence that will insure the survival of SF 
as vibrant, far reaching and respected litera- 
ture. 

1 see I have stomped my soapbox into 
splinters with this tirade and the hour is get- 
ting late. 

Once again my sincerest congratulations. 

Sincerely, 
Craig W. Anderson

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Galaxy is the last magazine in the world in 
which you’d find a schematic diagram trying 
to pass as fiction. Analog, sure, occasionally; 
even F & SF once published one. But 
Galaxyl I’ve been reading it for two years, 
and the worst of the stories were still stories. 

Not any more. 

I’m referring, of course, to Hayford 
Peirce’s nonstory “High Yield Bondage”. 
The rickety “story” that surrounds this arti- 
cle should have been removed, and what was 
left published as a non-fact article. It was 
mildly amusing, but a failure as straight fic- 
tion. 

And where do you get off limiting Alter to 
three pages, cutting him off when he was 
just starting? Geis’ Alter-Ego is picking up a 
lot of fans out here, and we’ll kick and 
scream till Alter gets his way. What harm 
can he do reviewing books? 

“Nobody Here but Us Shadows”: This is 
one of the best short stories you’ve published 
in your editorship so far. The ideas are 
well-worn, but Lundwall uses them in a to- 
tally original manner. I hope he makes 
further appearances in Galaxy. 

Keep up the (usually) good work. You just 
might break up Analog's monopoly on 
Hugos. 

Sincerely, 
Christopher DeVito 

Thank you . but not this year; Ben is still 
#/ in the hearts of fandom. (Congratula- 
tions, Mr. Bova on your third — in a row, 
yet! — Hugo.) 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I have recently read my first two issues of 
Galaxy, the April 1975 and June 1975 is- 
sues. I want to write to thank you for restor- 
ing my faith in science-fiction. 

A curious statement, you think. In my 
teens I was a heavy science-fiction fan. I 
didn’t have much money, but most of what I 
got went to science-fiction books. Arthur C. 
Clarke was my idol. (He still is, but Ursula 
K. Le Guin is giving him some stiff competi- 
tion.)

Then I joined the Marine Corps and I read 
almost no science-fiction from Dune until 
The Gods Themselves. I was, among other 
things, discovering philosophy and history. 
But, it was science-flction also that kept me 
off science-fiction! 

Suddenly, it seemed, science-fiction had 
become “socially relevant” and sold its soul 
to the peace-love-dope-anti-war-anti- 
establishment youth cultures. Of course, this 
wasn’t totally true for all science-fiction, but 
it seemed whenever I went to the book- 
shelves, the books all seemed to be promis- 
ing to be bigger put-downs “reflecting the 
social ills today projected to their terrifying 
possibilities”. 

I bought a few. A few too many! 
Science-fiction had also decided to become 
intellectual art! But what a strange definition 
of art these new stories had. Gone were such 
hack features like plot, characterization, and 
realistic dialogue. Chaos seemed to reign and 
its queen was unintelligible symbology. I dis- 
like bad literature. Science-fiction as art had 
become bad literature. 

Recently I have read Orbir 7, Orbit 12, 
Nova 3, and a few other such anthologies. 
There was less chaos and mystic symbology, 
but 1 was appalled at the pessimism! Of all 
those stories, not five left Earth. Nearly 
everyone of those stories foretold a dismal 
future of ruin or choking population. Human 
life was pictured as bare, helpless 
survival — an existance made horrible by 
mindless bureaucracy and heartless technol- 
ogy and devoid of dignity. 

I wondered where science-fiction’s star- 
spanning vision had gone. I recalled how 
meaningless President Kennedy’s challenge 
to reach the moon by 1969 was to me until A 
Fall Of Moondusi by Arthur C. Clarke gave 
me the vision — the meaning '. — of what this 
first flight would mean and could eventually 
bring about. These stories I had been reading 
would not inspire a young mind to anything 
unless it would be to the dismal hopelessness 
of striving for future goals. 

Of course, pessimism is as valid as op- 
timism, but I wondered if all science-fiction 
had given up to pessimism with only a few 

158 



reactionary hold-outs like Clarke, Asimov, 
Le Guin, and Norton. About this time I 
bought my first two issues of Gala.xy, plus 
some of the competition. 1 found again 
science-fiction that is both good literature 
and out among the stars. 

I learned through your magazine that 
science-fiction’s star-spanning vision is alive 
and well between your covers. Congratula- 
tions! You’ve just won a steady buyer. 

Thank you,

Frankly I have a certain fondness for peace, 
love, youth et a!., and am a bit of an anti- 
establishmentarian in the bargain — but I do 
believe that if life isn't worth liv- 
ing. .what's the point? 

Sir: 

There are many things in this world that I 
do not understand. Right now I’m having 
much trouble understanding the people in the 
science-fiction field. You people have made 
me ashamed to admit that I have been read- 
ing SF for 40 of my 49 years. The reason 
being you have changed SF from science- 
fiction to sex fantasy. 

What is this? Sex isn’t something new. It 
has been written about and talked about, had 
its picture photographed, painted, drawn, 
sculpted, scratched and smeared on so many 
things nobody could miss it. But jiot here 
please. That is not why I subscribe to your 
magazine. 

I know your writers need a lot of freedom 
to move ideas around in and to express 
things in new ways, but “freedom isn’t 
free”. You have a responsibility to me and 
others like me. If you want to print and sell 
all that trash, fine! Just be sure to change the 
title of your magazine so we will know be- 
fore we invest. I have spent no less than a 
hundred dollars this year trying to find 
science-fiction that isn’t obsessed with sex. 

Sex is not a spectator sport to me. If I 
can’t participate I’m not going to pay money 

GALAXY 




to watch someone else. If I can’t find 
science-fiction I won’t settle for sex fantasy. 
Put up or shut up! Produce science-fiction or 
get out of the business.

Dear Jim, 

Virgil Hays has criticized you for printing 
BE YE PERFECT, by M. A. Barter. Mr. 
Hays feels you should “knock off the crap 
and get back to science fiction.” What does 
he think sex is? A' thing to be put in 
Playboy, and conveniently forgotten when it 
comes to sf? No. As long as you are printing 
a story with two sexes involved, there either 
has to be or should be interaction between 
them. Not to advocate porno, but to demand 
a credible story. Even a moron could see 
that, the story being based on a society in 
which sex is a chore instead of a pleasure, 
there must be a reference to sex, or the en- 
counter written up. 

Let me ask those of you who agree with 
Mr. Hays — What’s your hangup? I am per- 
fectly willing to read a story in which there 
k some son of sex involved — PROVIDED it 
ps relevant to the story. Why is it you object 
fc sex in a story? Why is it you want to cen- 
^ stories like the one in question? 

• And you Jim, why do you print drivel like 
that? B*n B*v* at *N*L*G has been through 
it already, and so have we readers, so why 
give these nerds a forum to shout from? 

Sincerely,

Partly to see if I can elicit contrary re- 
sponses such as your own, and partly be- 
cause, well, I do try to provide a forum for 
many divergent points of view. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

As a year-old subscriber, 1 enjoy Galaxy 
quite a bit, especially Dick Geis (a friend of 
mine), Jerry Poumelle’s articles (which re- 
ally make me think), and the short stories. 



This is only personal opinion, because I 
know many readers enjoyed it, but I do not 
place “Sign of the Unicom” high on my 
list. I never have felt that serials have a 
place in any magazine. They are, to me, 
much like trying to watch a good movie on 
t.v. with too damn many commercials — the 
length in between episodes does the story no 
good. The latest serial, HELIUM, suffered 
from a bad case of too many characters. 
Though not a writer, one thing I always re- 
membered from college was “don’t get too 
many characters in your story” unless you 
can really develope them as Frank Herbert 
did his in DUNE. I would like to put in a 
vote for two-part or one-part serials. By one 
part, I mean none at all. But, I shall still 
read on as long as your quality remains as it 
has been since you took over. 

Very sincerely,

Thank you. Personally I thought the charac- 
ters in HELIUM were extremely well de- 
lineated. I guess some people like Dickensian 
type fiction — and others don’t! 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

By all means, publish Roger Zelazny’s 
fourth Amber novel — and by the way, Dar- 
nay’s Helium was probably the best serial 
printed in Galaxy within the last three years. 

Also, Dick Geis’s “Alien Viewpoint” 
column has contained some of the fiinniest 
material on SF that I’ve seen for several 
years. However, the irregularity of the col- 
umn can be disappointing at times. Do you 
plan to have Alter return in the next few is- 
sues? 

Cordially, 
John S. Kelly

100 (plus shipping and handling). You 
may examine them in your home, and if 
not completely satisfied, return them

cancelled and you'll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 limes a year), 
we'll send you the Club’s bulletin. 
Things to Come, describing the 2 com- 
ing Selections and a variety of Alternate 
choices. If you want both Selections, 
you need do nothing; they’ll be shipped 
automatically. If you don't want a Selec- 
tion, or prefer an Alternate, or no book 
at all, just fill out the convenient form 
always provided, and return it to us by 
the date specified. We try to allow you 
at least ten days for making your deci- 
sion. If you do not receive the form in 
time to respond within 10 days, and re- 
ceive an unwanted seTection, you may 
return it at our expense. 

As a member you need lake only 4 Se- 
lections or Alternates during the coming 
year. You may resign any time there- 
after, or remain a member as long as 
you wish. At least one of the two Selec- 



tions each month is only $1.98 plus 
shipping and handling. Other extra-value 
selections are slightly higher but always 
much less than Publishers' Editions.
