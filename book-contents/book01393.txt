EDITORIAL 

by CLIFFORD R. HONG 



Much has changed since the first 
incarnation of Worlds of IF back 
in the early 1950s. Science fiction 
is no longer relegated to pulpdom 
by the academics, considered fit 
only for a small (though devoted) 
audience. Today, SF books regu- 
larly make the best-seller lists, the 
films are blockbusters that capture 
the imaginations of millions, col- 
lege courses are taught, SF conven- 
tions attract thousands of fans, 
doctoral theses are written and in 
depth studies are made of the 
field . 

The field is older, much more 
established — and vastly popular. 
But the spirit of SF remains the 
same. Science fiction is a literature 
of ideas, constantly exploring new 
possibilities. Always asking, what 
would happen if? What if it could 
be proven that there is life after 
death? What if contact is made 
with intelligent aliens with whom 
we have nothing in common but 
games? What if learning by me- 



mory transfer becomes possible? 
What IF . .? 

In this vein, the new IF will bring 
you stories that explore a widely 
diverse range of speculations, 
dreams, and ideas with the finest 
in illustrated science fiction and 
fantasy. Fiction will be by both 
popular, established pros and 
newer, upcoming stars. Among the 
regular features is the IF first — in 
each issue we will bring you at 
least one story by a previously un- 
published writer. Prior IF Firsts 
have included Larry Niven, Gard- 
ner R. Dozois, and Alexi Panshin. 

This issue’s IF First is by Kerry 
Schaefer, a resident of Massachus- 
sets. Recently turned forty, 
Schaefer has held various jobs in 
her life — reservations agent for a 
steamship company, social 
worker, four years as a crew- 
member on a schooner — and cur- 
rently lives and works at a small 
motel on Cape Cod. She began 
writing six years ago after reading 




Jacqueline Lichtenberg’s Sime/ 
Gen books. After several years and 
half a dozen fan stories, she began 
work set in her own backgrounds, 
resulting in a novel and two short 
pieces. 

About her stories, she says: 

“ ‘Cloudscape’ began in one of 
the Jesse Stuart Writing Work- 
shops, when Marion Zinumer Brad- 
ley said, “Now, write the opening 
paragraph of a new story.” Fifteen 
minutes later, everyone else had a 
beginning and I had drawn a com- 
plete blank. Of course, she called 
on me to read mine. Determined 
not to endure such embarrassment 
the following day, I combined the 
beautiful Midwest thunderclouds 
through which my plane had flown 
to get to the workshop with a 
speculation from one of Carl 
Sagan’s books on possible life- 
forms on a gas giant, and suddenly 
an aging cloud-creature drifted 
through my mind and I knew I had 
my story. 



“I have begun work on another 
novel, dealing with aliens rather 
than humans, as seems to be 
characteristic of all my writing 
thus far. Given my penchant for 
telling a story from an alien point 
of view, sometimes I find it a wee 
bit difficult to remember that I re- 
ally am a human being. Whenever 
that happens, I run to the nearest 
mirror for confirmation and 
breathe a sigh of relief. (Or is it 
disappointment?)” 

Upcoming issues will feature 
new IF Firsts, along with material 
by such notables as Gene Wolfe, 
Justin Leiber, Raymond Z. Gallun, 
Jacqueline Lichtenberg, Alan Dean 
Foster, and many more. 

Please feel free to write and let 
us know what it is that you like 
about the magazine and what you 
don’t, which stories and illustra- 
tions are your favorites, and what 
you’d like to see in the future.

LOVE OF LIFE 

by RAY BROWN 
art: Michael Gilbert 



Policy was to turn swords into 
ploughshares, so by and by they 
turned “supersmart” ABM gui- 
dance units into happy faces that 
chased you with proto-cliches sel- 
ling the favorite public service 
program. 

“Good evening, buddy,” the but- 
ton-eyed moron intoned. “You’ve 
only got one self. Don’t waste it. 
Best wishes from your National 
Council on Population Stabiliza- 
tion.” 

Conway swatted at the thing and 
it swerved in the air, flylike. 

“Good evening, buddy,” it 
started again. “Give life a chance. 
After all, it could start getting bet- 
ter any minute now. Best wishes 
forever from your NCPS.” 

Conway intersected the street 
where his job waited for him. He 
cornered abruptly and at high 
speed, but the thing swooped high 
in the air over him and again ho- 
vered right in front of his face. 

“Be a friend,” it said. “Report the 
name of your distressed friend to 

6 IF 



the Suicide Prevention Squad of 
your local police force. Best 
wishes from...” 

“You stupid pest,” Conway 
growled, “I’m on the SPS.” 

He grabbed at it low. To his sur- 
prise, the thing ducked when it 
should have jumped and he wound 
up holding it in his hands, where 
it buzzed and tugged on him 
weakly. With a grunt of satisfac- 
tion, he pulled it above his head. 

“Buddy?” the thing said, “I have 
been endowed with an elementary 
survival drive. The idea of being 
smashed into the sidewalk fills me 
with something analogous to 
dread.” 

Conway was interested in spite 
of himself. He relaxed his shoul- 
ders a little and asked. “Why 
should I care?” 

“That’s a hard one to answer, 
buddy,” it said. “I can’t plead for 
my life by crying ‘murder’ because 
I’m not really alive anyway. Not 
that I’d want to be — it would be 
such a poor life. After all. I’m 




seized, like an epileptic, with slo- 
gan after slogan. You know, I’ve 
always wondered whether I had 
free will or not, but I still don’t 
know because I’ve never had the 
time to investigate. I never will find 
out now, I guess.” 

“Sounds like I’d be doing you a 
favor if I smashed you,” Conway 
said. 

“Please don’t,” it said. “Whatever 
it was they gave me instead of life 
is all I’ve got; and if you spare it 
I’ll try to do something nice for you 
sometime.” 

Conway didn’t know if the thing 
was giving off sympathy-inducing 
pheromones or not, but he now felt 
reluctant to smash it. It sounded 
so pathetic. 

“You can start doing something 
nice for me right now,” Conway 
said. “Just keep the hell away from 
me.” He tossed the happy face into 
the air. 

“Thanks,” it said. “And re- 
member: One life’s all you get, so 
don’t quit on us yet. Best wishes 
fi-om your NCPS.” 

Conway screamed and grabbed 
at it. His luck didn’t hold, but amaz- 
ingly, the happy face kept its part 
of the bargain and sped away over 
the roof of the police station. Con- 
way sighed, and walked inside and 
down the dirty stairs to the 
monitor room in the basement. 

Roth, one of the monitors, was 
there waiting for his shift to start. 
He always got there early so he 
could try to figure out, according 
to some mystical system of his 
own, which booth would get the 
fewest calls that night. 

8 IF 



“What are you pissed at?” Roth 
asked Conway as he hung lip his 
coat and signed in. “You look like 
they just upped your birth quota.” 
Conway told the story of his re- 
cent annoyance and Roth smiled. 
His chest swelled with importance 
and superior knowledge. 

“They’re programmed to say that 
when they’re caught,” he said. “You 
got suckered.” 

Pearson, Conway’s partner for 
the week, entered scowling. This 
time, though, Roth made no com- 
ment. When Pearson scowled it 
was no big deal; he took his Job 
very seriously. 

“What’s the count for the day, 
Roth?” Pearson asked. 

“Average,” Roth said. “118 so far. 
But with a rising trend.” 

“The antisocial bastards. How 
many did we stop?” 

“Twenty-one. And a good thing 
that’s all. Life Center 36 doesn’t 
open until tomorrow.” 

Pearson shrugged angrily. 
“Stack’em like bricks,” he growled. 
“They’re criminals. They knew the 
consequences of their act.” 

The minute hand on the over- 
head clock twitched upright and 
the noon-to-eight shift rose in a 
body as the rest of Conway’s shift 
slouched in. Roth edged quickly 
into booth #4. 

“It got lots of calls during the 
first shift,” he explained, “And it’s 
Wednesday.” 

Nobody believed in Roth’s crazy 
system, Conway included. But 
Conway had noticed that for some 
reason Roth actually got the fewest 
calls, more often than not. Con- 




way’s job was getting him down. 
He asked Roth if he and Pearson 
could work with him that night. 

“Sure,” Roth said, punching their 
codes in. 

“Wait a minute,” Pearson said. 
“Didn’t you come here to work, 
Conway? I did.” 

“Roth’s got Just as much chance 
of a buzz as any other monitor,” 
Conway said, his throat tight. 

“I came here to save lives,” Pear- 
son said. Conway noticed for the 
first time, as Pearson advanced on 
him with clenched fists, that his 
partner outweighed him by about 
fifty pounds and was unusually 
ugly. 

Roth’s screen came alive at that 
moment — as did every screen in 
the basement. 

“You got some work right now,” 
Roth said. “We got a creative. One 
suicide and it looks like three bud- 
dies giving him the send-off. If I 
can figure out where it is. it’s not 
coming through the regular net- 
work, it’s being picked up by 
one of the old fixed security 
cameras . Jesus . It’s right out- 
side here!” 

Already people were abandon- 
ing the booths and running up- 
stairs. Pearson dropped his fists 
and joined them immediately. Roth 
and Conway followed, and caught 
up with him on the station’s stoop. 

Right across the street was an 
outsize cannon pointed at the sta- 
tion. Sitting on the end of the muz- 
zle was a man in a superman suit 
draining a glass of red wine and 
below him were three firiends 
doing likewise. Above the cannon 



was stretched a banner; 

THE GREAT SPLATTO: HUMAN 
CANNONBALL. 

“Hey!” Pearson bellowed. “You 
can’t do that!” 

A crowd was gathering around 
the creative, some cheering The 
Great Splatto, some jeering the 
cops. One of Splatto’s friends of- 
fered him a crash helmet and, in 
the best tradition of daredeviltry, 
Splatto waved it away and crawled 
backwards down the bore. 

Pearson and a number of other 
cops yelled and charged across the 
street waving needle guns, but it 
was too late. One of the three 
touched the cannon off, everybody 
ducked, and The Great Splatto 
zoomed out and up until his body 
was abruptly stopped by the police 
station’s limestone wall and his 
soul sailed on to Heaven. 

They don't like us, Conway 
thought, sickly. They really don't 
like us. 

“A flower!” said Roth, crawling 
back to his feet and looking at what 
they’d have to clean up. 

The crowd broke up quickly, 
abandoning cannon and banner, 
and Pearson rejoined them. “Dis- 
gusting,” he said, gesturing at the 
wall. 

“I don’t know,” Roth said. “It’s 
rather colorful, actually.” 

Pearson didn’t turn on Roth, 
Conway noticed. Probably be- 
cause Roth was the Chiefs 
nephew. 

So there was nothing more to 
say. Roth returned to the basement 
and Conway and Pearson hurried 
to the back of the station and 



Love of Life

signed out their flyer, thereby 
avoiding the clean-up detail. 

They patrolled for an hour with- 
out getting any calls from Roth be- 
side a chatty one informing them 
that the front wall had lost about 
twenty square feet of plaster. It 
was soothingly quiet. Pearson had 
scarcely spoken to Conway since 
they’d paired up for the week, and 
that was just fine with Conway. But 
an hour was a phenomenally long 
time to go without a call, even for 
Roth, and Conway noticed Pearson 
opening and closing his mouth, 
fidgeting with his adam’s apple. 

Finally, Pearson spoke. “What 
the hell,” he said, “are you doing 
in the SPS, anyway? You’re not the 
type.” 

“The extra pay, of course,” Con- 
way said. “You got a better 
reason?” 

“I love life,” Pearson said. 

It was hard for Conway to choke 
back his laughter. He gave himself 
a small coughing fit. 

Pearson looked at him askance 
and said, “I mean it. And it’s not 
that I’m pretending I’m a saint, 
either. I have good, selfish reasons 
for standing against the forces of 
dissolution and death. I always had 
great hopes for my life — ^I could 
have gone places, you know? I’m 
a natural leader of 
men. I could have wound up 
being . well, never mind about 
that. I can still go places, and if 
the SPS does its Job I damned well 
will What happened four months 
ago doesn’t have to make any dif- 
ference.” 

10 IF 



“If the whole society doesn’t col- 
lapse first, that is,” Conway said. 

“Just shut the fuck up if you can’t 
say anything constructive,” Pear- 
son grumbled. 

Conway took Pearson at his 
word, smiled, and relaxed. With 
luck, that would be Pearson’s last 
attempt at polite conversation 
until the end of the week. 

Pearson had raised an interest- 
ing, if familiar, question, though. 
Why the hell was he in the SPS? 
Why, for that matter, was he a cop 
at all? 

He hated to think the main 
reason was a silly argument with 
Grandpa Conway six years ago — 
but every time he thought the ques- 
tion over, he had a harder time 
avoiding the conclusion that he’d 
joined to prove his grandfather 
wrong. 

When he’d first brought up the 
possibility of police work to the 
old man he’d merely mentioned it 
casually. But his grandfather had 
chewed him out good. He thought 
cops were bullies, one and all. His 
argument was simple; people 
gravitate to the positions for which 
they are best suited, and what bet- 
ter position for a bully than govern- 
ment-approved good? There must 
be something wrong with Conway 
to even think of such a thing. If he 
didn’t start out twisted, he’d wind 
up that way. 

Well, Grandpa had been wrong. 
The force had many gentle, con- 
scientious people on it who joined 
with the idea of protecting the un- 
derdog. But there were a surpris- 
ingly large number of bullies. 




Hell-face it, Conway told him- 
self, Pearson's one of them. 

And Pearson was right about his 
chances of rising high. That was 
the real problem with government 
work — it was the bullies who 
found their way to the top. The 
Chief was a bully, the lieutenant 
was a bully — even the Mayor was, 
in his own way. So even though 
Grandpa’s warning wasn’t quite ac- 
curate, it turned out that Conway 
should have listened to it anyway. 

The warning might turn out to 
be a prophecy, though, as the bul- 
lies hung on and the others passed 
on . 

His reverie was interrupted by 
Roth’s voice rattling at them 
through the radio. 

“I finally got one for you,” he 
said. “Good Neighbor Report.” 

“It took you long enough,” Pear- 
son said. 

“Hey! I’m not the only one! It’s 
been quiet all over the monitor 
room— downright spooky. Some- 
thing funny’s going on . .” 

“Spare me the theories,” Pearson 
said. “What’s the report?” 

“A good, neighborly apartment 
manager thinks some woman in his 
complex has a heaven set. He’s 
afraid she’ll croak herself and 
leave him with the disposal prob- 
lem.” 

Roth gave the address and Con- 
way turned the flyer around and 
punched it in. While looking in the 
rear-view mirror he noticed that 
they’d picked up a few mobile 
cameras and happy faces. They 
seemed to like to follow flyers. It 
was almost as if — ^ridiculous as it 



sounded — they couldn’t quite 
shake their military habits. 

On the other hand, they were 
shirking their duty — ignoring the 
NCPS directives. So, in a sense, it 
was an exercise of free will. And 
more and more happy faces 
seemed to be doing it every day. 
Conway wondered if the one he’d 
encountered on the way to work 
was among them. He hoped not. 

“Hell,” Pearson said. “Even if she 
doesn’t try to kill herself — ^heaven 
sets are the cause of all this damn 
trouble and it’s against the law to 
own one. Should have been re- 
ported before now.” 

“Let’s not go busting the apart- 
ment manager, too!” Conway pro- 
tested. “Leave the little stuff 
alone.” 

“Little!” roared Pearson. “If you 
ask me, having one of those 
damned things around ought to 
pull the death penalty!” 

Pearson realized suddenly what 
he’d said and blushed. Conway 
laughed — inwardly — all the way to 
the scene of the crime. 

It was a first floor flat. The man- 
ager said the woman, though 
young, was a sickly type who had 
trouble with stairs. The door was 
unlocked. They knocked, there 
was no answer, they walked in. 

It was dark in there, but Conway 
made out a pale oval suspended in 
the shadows, lit by the feeble glow 
of the heaven set. He thought it 
might be a face and he stepped to- 
wards it, not thinking that would 
put him in the set’s field. 

Conway had to sit on the floor. 

Love of Life 11 




fast, to settle himself. He’d only ex- 
perienced a heaven set once be- 
fore — not enough to train himself 
to avoid the nausea that came 
when he tried to move while 
watching two worlds at once. He 
realized that the second scene was 
all in his mind — ^that no physiolog- 
ical laws were really being bro- 
ken — but that didn’t help. Only 
being still helped. 

He still saw, as dimly as ever, 
the ill-lit room, but he also saw sun- 
light sparkling in the dew on a 
grassy hill, and a young man sitting 
on a tree stump a little way up the 
hill, talking. 

“ . isn’t really that much differ- 
ent, Miss Hensley. Like 1 said, the 
main difference is that you com- 
pletely control your own body. You 
could get sick if you wanted to, but 
who’d . .” 

Conway looked the young man 
over carefully. He thought he rec- 
ognized him — the small, sharp 
nose, the squint, the collapsed chin 
all reminded him of someone he’d 
met ... oh, maybe two years 
ago . back in the relatively re- 
laxed days when he was on 
Homicide, long before there was 
such a thing as the SPS. 

The voice was familiar, too, but 
changed since Conway knew the 
guy. The tenseness had gone out 
of it — only to be expected from a 
man who’d gone to Heaven, or 
wherever it was. Might as well call 
it Heaven. Indeed, what else could 
you call it? 

"... claimed he picked up a few 
tricks here and there in the capac- 
ity of His Majesty King George the 



Third’s personal — and all that im- 
plies — lickspittle ...” 

He had it. The man was Gerald 
Parker, the rapist and murderer 
who’d caused such a panic in the 
city two years ago. Conway had 
been instrumental in his arrest and 
ultimate frying. 

“Gerry?” Conway croaked. 
“Excuse me. Miss Hensley,” 
Gerry said, and turned to Conway. 
“Hi there! I had a feeling you’d 
show up at this set at about this 
time, so I volunteered to talk to 
Miss Hensley. I always meant to 
thank you for catching me and get- 
ting me electrocuted.” 

“It was nothing . .” 

“Nothing! Man, this place is won- 
derful! Everybody loves it here — 
every moment’s like the moment 
when a part catches fire 
and , . hey, you look stunned.” 
“I’m Just surprised to see you 
there,” Conway said. 

“Why? It’s been four months 
since Kirchner invented the 
heaven set. Surely you must have 
heard by now that everybody 
comes here when they die — no 
matter what.” 

“I heard it and I thought I be- 
lieved it. But I guess seeing is really 
believing. So how are you doing, 
Gerry?” 

“Great — same as everybody. 
Getting laid a lot — but you know, 
I had these sexual hang ups. I lost 
them when I got here, and sex be- 
came truly important to me.” 

“I don’t think I get that . wait 
a minute, maybe I do understand 
it after all!” 

“Yeah. And the rejuvenation

IF 




keeps you interested in the physi- 
cal pleasures, too. My body was 
pretty rotten before I got here. Hav- 
ing a body in tip-top condition is 
very important to human happi- 
ness. While your body’s wearing 
out on Earth you tend to fool your- 
self on that subject . you should 
see the old folks caper!” 

Conway became aware of all the 
tiny pains he usually ignored. He 
could feel them growing, slowly, 
inexorably. 

“What about God?” Pearson’s 
voice asked abruptly. 

Conway’s head Jerked toward 
the sound and he discerned Pear- 
son’s form, also sitting on the floor. 
He’d completely forgotten about 
him, and why they were there. 
“Who’s that?” Gerry asked. 

“My partner.” 

“No, 1 meant . never mind, it 
was a bad joke. God is still an open 
question. I’m afraid. If there’s a 
Somebody responsible for things 
being this way, then He hasn’t cho- 
sen to reveal Himself yet.” 

“Who’s in charge, then?” Pear- 
son said. 

“Nobody.” 

“I’ll put it another way. Who sees 
that things get done?” 

“Nobody,” Gerry repeated, 
shrugging. “I lost my need to push 
people around when I got here — 
everybody does. There’s not much 
strife. People basically do what 
they want. So there’s no reason for 
anybody to be in charge.” 

“The same doubletalk,” Pearson 
said darkly. 

“It’s no doubletalk ...” 

Conway decided to change the 



subject. “What else are you doing 
with your time?” he asked. 

Gerry grinned. “Studying En- 
glish history. Right now I’m learn- 
ing Anglo-Saxon from this old guy 
named Aelfric. History always in- 
terested me on Earth, but you 
know I didn’t have much of a brain. 
Your mind gets a lot sharper after 
you die, though. I mean — I’m no 
Einstein now, but Aelfric and some 
of the other long-timers tell me that 
when I really need to get smarter 
again, it’ll happen. When are you 
coming to join us, Conway?” 

“Uh . not right away. In fact. 
I’m supposed to be stopping that 
kind of thing. I don’t know how 
much news you get from Earth, but 
you must have heard of the SPS.” 

Gerry laughed and dismissed the 
SPS with the wave of a hand. 

“You guys can’t do anything,” he 
said. “Don’t you know that? Once 
Earth got a really effective way to 
communicate with us, the rules aU 
changed. The End Is Nigh, Con- 
way — can’t you telV^ In a few more 
months . .” 

The second vision disappeared 
and Conway was once again fully 
in the dark apartment — really 
dark, now. He could just barely 
make out the body of Pearson lean- 
ing over the heaven set. He’d 
switched it off. 

Conway pushed himself from 
the floor and fumbled around the 
wall until he hit a working light 
switch. Then he saw that Pearson 
was still bent over the set, staring 
at it, panting, and trembling vio- 
lently. 

“Pearson?” Conway called

gently. 

Pearson grunted, turned to stare 
with frightened eyes at Conway. 
Then he raised a boot high and 
smashed the set. 

“A goddam rapistr Pearson 
said. “I don’t believe it. The whole 
thing’s a fraud, and when we prove 
it . .” 

“You know it’s not a fraud,” Con- 
way said.” Don’t go off the deep 
end on me, Pearson.” 

“Gerry?” a weak female voice 
called from where Conway had 
thought he’d seen a face. 

It was a face floating in a sea of 
blankets on the couch by the far 
wall. An ugly face, twisted with 
pain, eaten away, spitting blood. 
When they unwrapped her they 
saw that the rest of the body 
looked even worse. 

“Cancer,” Conway guessed. 

She had an old Mauser .32 in her 
right hand. Pearson pried it loose, 
pocketed it, and said. “Let’s take 
her in.” 

“You’ve got to be kidding!” Con- 
way said. “She’ll be dead in a 
couple days anyway!” 

“I’ve had about all the shit 1 can 
take off of you, Conway. The law’s 
the law and we take her in.” 

The law also required that they 
cuff her hand to foot, so she 
couldn’t make the attempt while 
they flew her to the Life Center. 
Pearson didn’t bother. Conway 
thought about congratulating him 
on that small display of humanity, 
but decided he’d better not. Maybe 
Pearson just forgot. 

Life Center 35 was another 



limestone building — the mayor’s 
brother owned a quarry in In- 
diana — in the shape of a cereal 
box — the Chiefs cousin was a bad 
architect — with barred windows 
underlined by empty planters. It 
looked more or less like a prison 
hospital and that was more or less 
what it was. Force-feeding for 
those who could take it, and the 
Drip for the rest. Straight jackets. 
Leg chains. Rough hemp rope 
when they ran out of those. There 
were very few successful suicides 
in the Life Centers. 

The roof, Conway thought as 
they hovered preparing to land, 
looked strangely empty. Life Cen- 
ters had been the government’s 
main interest since the war with 
Tarawa ended with the islanders 
escaping to Heaven en masse and 
the military was dismantled; the lot 
was usually jammed. 

He turned to check Miss Hensley 
in the back. She thrashed around, 
delirious, still calling for Gerry oc- 
casionally. As he reached for a 
pulse, the flyer’s radio came alive. 

“Don’t land!” a voice — not 
Roth’s — ^said. “We’ve got a bomb 
threat!” 

Pearson grabbed the mike. “Is 
this the Life Center?” he asked. 

“Right. Now get off this channel. 
We’re trying to contact the police.” 
“We are the police,” Pearson 
said, landing the flyer. “And we’ve 
got a customer for you.” 

“Thank God!” the voice said. 
“Why can’t we raise the station?” 
“What do you mean, you can’t 
raise the station?” 

“We can’t raise the station!”

IF 




Pearson whitened. “Hang on,” he 
said. “I’ll try to raise them myself.” 
He fiddled with the radio, yelling, 
“Roth! Roth!” 

There was no answer. Pearson 
called the Life Center. “Are you still 
there?” 

“Yes. Did you get them?” 

“No. What’s going on?” 

“I was hoping you could tell me. 
I suspect they may have bombed 
the station before hitting the Life 
Centers. Our informant claims 
they’re going to send human 
bombs into all thirty-five tonight.” 
“They’ve never tried anything 
like that before.” 

“Haven’t you noticed that in the 
past four months most people have 
started hating our guts? This is the 
night they make the big attempt to 
free all the suicides. Don’t teU me 
you haven’t been expecting it.” 
“What can they do? You’ve still 
got your picket around the build- 
ing, haven’t you?” 

“A weak one. Some of the guards 
have deserted. One sht his throat 
at roll call, in front of everybody. 
And I don’t know what they can 
do, unless — hold on. I’m getting a 
report from the guards now 
. Jesus! Listen, can you help us?” 
“Name it.” 

“Take off again. I think you can 
help us most by sniping for us from 
the flyer. You’ll understand when 
you get in the air and can see 
what’s going on.” 

Pearson shrugged and took the 
flyer back up. Conway pressed his 
face to the window and gasped. 

At every street corner around 
the hospital there were crowds 



carrying torches. In the center of 
every crowd there was a large can- 
non and a banner. THE GREAT 
BIJVMMO. THE GREAT 
SPLOTTO. T.&T., THE EXPLOD- 
ING TWINS . 

Conway pushed his needle gun 
through the little port designed for 
it and carefully aimed at those 
nearest the Great Blammo’s can- 
non, but the flyer swooped unpre- 
dictably as Pearson screamed with 
rage and shook the stick. 

Conway thought about past 
“creative” fads as he aimed again. 
Crucifixions had been an early fa- 
vorite of the more masochistic 
types. There had even been 
another circus motif once — diving 
from a great height into a 
thimbleful! of water. But there had 
never been a fad as quick to catch 
on as this. Past the Great Blammo 
he could see, far down the street, 
that Life Centers 17 and 3 were 
also surrounded by hazy clumps of 
torchlight. No doubt about it, this 
was going to be the night. 

What was really discouraging 
was that the crowds were making 
a carnival — a joke — out of the 
whole thing. 

He squeezed off a shot and one 
of the men sitting on the cannon 
slumped. At the same time, 
Splotto’s cannon fired and Splotto, 
whooping, arms and legs flailing-, 
sailed into Life Center 35’s front 
wall. There was an explosion, then 
a smoky hole. 

“Looks like these missiles are 
armed,” Conway said. 

“What the hell are the guards 
doing?” Pearson growled. 



Love of Life 



15 




“There are a lot more people 
then needles,” Conway said. “What 
can they do?” 

There were more explosions 
from the back side. The building 
shook. Conway breathed out, 
aimed at the Great Blammo again, 
then jerked back straight in his 
seat as he noticed where the can- 
non was pointed. 

It was too late to do anything 
about it. There was an enormous 
thick whack and the windows on 
Conway’s side were completely 
smeared. Conway and Pearson 
ducked and covered their faces, 
the bomb went off, the windows 
shattered, and the flyer spun 
wildly. Pearson swore and shook 
the controls, and gradually the 
spinning stopped. But they were 
losing altitude. 

“Can you land us?” Conway said. 

“Yeah. And we should land any- 
way. Those guards need some sort 
of leadership. I’m a natural leader 
of men.” 

All things considered, Pearson 
did a good job landing. He put the 
flyer down with a wrenching 
thump, but he put it right where 
he wanted it — directly in front of 
the ragged line of guards. Then he 
jumped out. 

“Why aren’t you men firing?” he 
yelled. 

Conway turned to check their 
passenger again and found that the 
trip had been too rough for her. 
She’d been released. He sighed 
with relief and hopped out of the 
flyer to join Pearson. 

Pearson had rounded up five of 
the guards, impressed them with 

16 IF 



his SPS uniform, and was now 
herding them into position to shoot 
at the men behind the cannon. 
Another cannon went off, a body 
sailed over their heads, and they 
all looked up and turned to follow 
it into the Life Center wall. The 
explosion was bigger than usual 
and one side of the building 
seemed to sag. The crowds of can- 
noneers cheered. 

To his surprise, Conway found 
himself cheering inwardly, too. 

The guard’s were interrupted 
again — ^this time by a large, air- 
borne TV screen with the mayor’s 
face on it, sailing over no man’s 
land. 

“Return to your homes!” the 
major boomed. “The city is now 
under martial law and . .” 

The rioters roared with laughter, 
“ . will not be prosecuted if 
you’re home by ten o’clock. I re- 
peat, a general amnesty for those 
keeping the curfew, but severe 
penalties for those . .” 

“Fire!” Pearson yelled. The 
guards fired. A few men dropped. 
Others took their place. 

Another body tumbled over Con- 
way’s head, but he no longer found 
the sight discouraging. In fact, he 
was exhilarated. Why bother stick- 
ing around in a world with Pear- 
sons in it? 

So this is how they feel, he 
thought. I wonder why it took me 
so long. 

One of the guards apparently 
had the same revelation, for he 
pushed himself up from the prone 
position and started to walk away. 
Pearson grabbed him, spun him 




around, pulled Miss Hensley’s .32 
from his pocket and waved it in 
the guard’s face. 

“Go ahead,” the guard said, smil- 
ling. “Do me a favor.” 

Conway stepped in front of Pear- 
son. 

“Go on home, guys,” he said. 
“This is pointless.” 

“What are you talking about!” 
Pearson yelled. “We’ve got a job to 
do!” 

The guards were all walking 
away now. Pearson watched them 
for a minute, then turned back to 
Conway and smashed his fist into 
Conway’s face. 

As Conway lay on the ground, 
listening to his head pound and 
feeling the blood from his cut 
forehead trickle into his eye, he 
looked with his other eye at Pear- 
son standing over him, panting and 
quaking as he had over the heaven 
set he’d smashed. The sight made 
Conway feel strangely gleeful. 

Another extra-loud explosion 
came from the back of the Life 
Center and Conway jerked his 
head around in time to see the 
whole building collapse. The riot- 
ers cheered again and started run- 
ning towards the rubble to make 
sure their job was finished. 

“Give it up, Pearson,” he said. 
“Can’t you see it’s all over?” 

“What?” Pearson asked, dully. 

The rioters were shoving past 
them now, ignoring them. Pearson 
ignored the rioters, too. His atten- 
tion was focused wholly on Con- 
way. 

“You, the mayor, the Chief, all 
you folks are through,” Conway 



said. “Used to be, when you pushed 
people around, the safest, easiest 
way of people to cope with it was 
to pretend it was for their own 
good. Now there’s an easier way 
out. Can’t you see how absurd, how 
useless these suicide laws are? You 
can’t stop ur 

“We’ll stop it,” said Pearson, “if 
we have to put straight jackets on 
every one of you.” 

Pearson was actually grimacing 
and grinding his teeth! Amazing! 

“Why don’t you just relax, Pear- 
son, and join the rest of us? We’re 
all going to a better place, you 
dummy!” 

“What better place? A leaderless 
anarchy! You’re a life-hater, Con- 
way, just as sick as those clowns 
with their cannon.” He pointed the 
.32 at Conway. 

Conway laughed, then said, “Go 
ahead. Do me a favor.” 

“Oh, no,” Pearson said, his eyes 
growing frighteningly wide and 
earnest. “You don’t understand. 
You’re obviously a potential 
suicide. You need to be restrained 
and placed in the Life Center. But 
I’ve got business to attend to” — he 
waved his gunless hand towards 
the crowd where the Life Center 
used to be — “and I can’t bother 
with keeping you under guard. But 
a carefully placed bullet in each 
limb . .” 

Conway tried to reassure him- 
self by convincing himself that he’d 
bleed to death. But he wasn’t sure. 
He crawled backwards, trying to 
make it to his feet as Pearson, now 
wild-eyed and totally bananas, 
aimed the .32 low.

The Light Fantastic 

Book Reviews by Orson Scott Card 



I can’t possibly guess what books 
you’re going to like. If I tell you that 
LaVerne and the Wood Elves is the 
best epic fantasy since Tolkien, you’ll 
no doubt fall asleep on page 10. And 
you’ll really get annoyed that I never 
mention any of the works of Cecil 
DeBeuf, your very favorite writer. 

But that’s OK. Storytellers should all 
have a chance to fmd their proper au- 
dience, and readers will sort them- 
selves out very neatly according to 
which stories they believe in and care 
about. 

We’re all visitors in a great mar- 
ketplace of fiction. Some of us come 
in from the farm, others from the city; 
some are connoisseurs, some just like 
a good yarn. We wander through the 
bazaar, hearing bits of story from this 
talespinner or that yarnswapper. When 
we hear one we like, we settle down 
and listen. 

When the storyteller is finished, we 
usually toss him a few coins and move, 
looking for more. Now and then, how- 
ever, we find one whose tales are so 
true, so powerful, so perfect, that it’s 
almost a religious experience. We want 
to listen to his stories forever, to live 
the rest of our lives in the worlds he 



creates. We’re not Just entertained, 
we’re converted. And like most reli- 
gious converts, we want to spread the 
word. We drag all our friends to the 
bazaar to hear our talespinner. Some 
of them get just as excited as we are, 
and join us; others think we’re crazy 
and move on. 

Admit it— you’ve done that. You’ve 
read a book and been so excited you 
shoved copies into your friends’ hands 
and commanded them to read. It hap- 
pened in the sixties. That’s how I first 
discovered Dune. And Bradbury. And 
Lewis’ Narnia books. So many people 
were touting Lord of the Rings that 
I refused to read it for three years, I 
was so sick of hearing about it. But I 
finally did. And I was glad my friends 
persisted. 

That’s what I plan to do with this 
column. I’m going to grab you and 
shake you until you promise to read 
the books I like best. I’ll point out 
others that I also er\joyed a lot. 

Now, you may not like the same 
stories I Like. You may not like as many 
stories as I like. I do have a tendency 
to read the way I watch a movie or a 
play — with my jaw agape, drinking it 
all in. That doesn’t mean I’m not dis-

ceming. It just means that I’m some- 
times willing to forgive mistakes and 
lapses that you can’t forgive. 

For instance, if you’re one of those 
people who reads science fiction with 
your pocket calculator turned on so 
you can check the math, you’re going 
to hate some things 1 like a lot, be- 
cause ru forgive a little silly science 
when the story’s good enough. And if 
you think good literature died with 
Robert E. Howard or H.P. Lovecraft, 
you won’t agree with my opinions very 
often. 

One thing I won’t do, though, is tell 
you what not to read. 

That’s where I think a lot of critics 
go astray. If I like a book, I can describe 
it to you and tell you why I think it’s 
good. But if I really hate a book, if I 
think a book is completely worthless, 
then there isn’t a single intelligent 
thing I can say about it. Because no 
matter how cleverly I describe its flaws 
to you, all I’m really saying is, “I don’t 
get it.” Or, in more formal terms: “I’m 
not a fit member of the audience for 
this tale.” 

So you won’t see any killer reviews 
here. (Those of you with a thirst for 
auctorial blood will have to go else- 
where for an elixir fix.) 1 will only talk 
about books 1 liked. 

Science Fiction Books: 
Grand Opera in Space 

Sebastian Nightingale Cain is a 
bounty hunter among the worlds of the 
Inner Frontier. The Democracy pays 
him to hunt down and bring back 
wanted criminals who have taken re- 
fuge on planets where the only law is 
the local crime lord. 

In Mike Resnick’s wonderful novel 
SANTIAGO: A MYTH OF THE FAR 
FUTURE, Sebastian Cain gets a lead 
on the most- wanted criminal of all, the 
almost legendary Santiago. In follow- 



ing Santiago’s trail, Cain picks up a 
few unwanted allies and enemies: 

Virtue MacKenzie (the “Virgin 
Queen”), a lady journalist who wants 
to be there to record the moment when 
Santiago gets killed — or interview him 
over Cain’s cooling corpse. 

Terwilliger, a gambler who cheated 
the wrong man, vengeful Manmoun- 
tain Bates; now he hangs on to Cain 
as his only hope of survival. 

The Jolly Swagman, a high-class, 
clean-hands crook who wants to be 
there to get Santiago’s art treasures 
when somebody kills him. 

Father William, a gun-toting born- 
again bounty hunter who uses the re- 
ward money from the men he snuffs 
to finance his ministry. 

Angel, the greatest bounty hunter of 
all, the one to bet on if you think any- 
body can get Santiago. 

They all weave in and out of a plot 
full of betrayals and doublecrosses, 
with dozens of other unforgettable 
characters, like Dmitri Sokol, Poor 
Yorick, Socrates, One-Time Charlie, 
Simple Simon, Altair of Altair, Moon- 
ripple, Silent Annie, Geronimo Gentry, 
Giles Sans Pitie, the alien named Sit- 
ting Bull, and Schussler the cyborg 
spaceship. 

One character we never actually 
meet is Black Orpheus, but the epic 
poem he’s writing about mythic fron- 
tier characters is the lens through 
which we see all these characters. 
Even as Sebastian Cain resists the 
nickname (“Songbird”) that Orpheus 
has given him, we see that he deserves 
his legend. 

Now, as soon as they know that 
SANTIAGO is a story of bounty hun- 
ters on the frontier, some critics are 
going to despise the book as a “western 
dressed up to be sci-fi.” Well, that’s 
their loss for being too shallow to see 
what’s really going on. Western? Sure,

IF 




Resnick is using all the devices of 
classic westerns. He’s also using 
motifs from Depression-era detective 
fiction. And the techniques of space 
opera. And grand opera, too. In fact, if 
there’s ever been a literary form that 
had vigor, life, excitement, truth, and 
beauty, you’ll hear echoes of it in 
SANTIAGO. 

Resnick was gutsy enough to set out 
to create myth, and as far as I’m con- 
cerned, he succeeds on a grand scale. 
By the end of this book, if you aren’t 
in love with all the characters you have 
no heart. If you aren’t moved by the 
digging of the third grave in the dell 
by the pond, then your license to read 
ought to be suspended for at least a 
month. 

By page 50 1 knew I was reading one 
of the best sf novels of the year. The 
only thing that worried me was San- 
tiago himself. Resnick was setting him 
up to be so mythic, so powerful, that 
when we finally met him he was bound 
to be a disappointment. (Of course. 
Resnick could have copped out and 
never let us meet him. But if he’d done 
that, I wouldn’t be telling you about 
the book at all). 

Suffice it to say that I wasn’t disap- 
pointed. Resnick struck every note 
exactly right. Even his characters’ 
views on political philosophy, an area 
where sf writers degenerate into silli- 
ness, were refreshingly mature and 
balanced. And by the end I felt fulfilled. 
And joyful. The glow stayed with me 
for days. Resnick didn’t Just do well 
in writing this book. He also did good. 

Have I made myself clear? If your 
bookstore doesn’t have copies of 
SANTIAGO, order one. Unless you 
read with a slide rule in hand (yeah, 
they hop from planet to planet the way 
we fly from New York to LA.), or un- 
less you think Moby Dick is about as 
much excitement as you can handle in 



fiction (sorry, this one is never dull so 
it can’t be Art), SANTIAGO belongs 
in your hands, in your library, in your 
memory. 

1.5 First Novels 

Brad Strickland is a soft-spoken, 
mild-mannered professor from 
Georgia who can light a fire inside you 
when he writes. TO STAND BE- 
NEATH 'THE SUN is his first novel. 

Tom Perion comes out of stasis as 
his landing csqisule plummets toward 
a planet. It is not the planet lus expe- 
dition was supposed to reach. In short 
order he discovers that he was 
awakened a millennium late — ^most of 
the colonists landed so long ago that 
the starship Galileo is now worship- 
ped as the goddess Kalea. 

The first batch of colonists had been 
genetically altered so that seven out 
of eight births were female. The idea 
was to boost the population quickly, 
then make a genetic change to more 
normal birth patterns. The trouble was 
that the colonists never recovered a 
working command module, and so 
they could never signal the ship to send 
down the rest of the colonists. That 
birth pattern has continued: men are 
a rare commodity. As a result, Perion 
finds himself in a seafaring world 
where women are the dominant sex, 
and men are pampered “lords,” prison- 
ers of a system where siring children 
is all they’re really allowed to do. Per- 
ion predictably has no interest in 
meekly accepting his sex role; instead, 
he is determined to recover a com- 
mand module that is still in stasis in 
the supposedly unlivable northern de- 
sert; if he reaches it, he can contact 
the starship, revive the few remaining 
sleepers there, and restore modem 
teclmology. 

Strickland is not creating a feminist 
role-reversal novel; instead, he has 



The Light Fantastic 



21 




carefully extrapolated the probable re- 
sults of a seven-to-one ratio of women 
to men, and how society would have 
to adapt to deal with it. Both the indi- 
vidual characters and the society at 
large are convincingly drawn, as Per- 
ion constantly runs afoul of local cus- 
toms. 

It’s a familiar motif — a lone man in 
a strange yet human environment, 
gradually learning how to become part 
of the society without ceasing to be 
himself. Clavell dealt with the same 
myth in Shogun, as John Hersey did 
in his science fiction masterpiece 
White Lotus. Strickland does as well, 
as far as he goes. Yet If there is any 
Haw in TO STAND BENEATH THE 
SUN, it is that Strickland needed to 
take more time with it, as Hersey and 
Clavell did; he needed to write the five 
or six hundred pages that his subject 
deserved. 

Perion should have had to adapt 
more before he succeeded in bending 
the world to fit his needs. He should 
have taken several years before he was 
able to launch his expedition. I can 
even tell you the exact place where 
the book is telescoped to the point of 
losing credibility; Perion stupidly de- 
stroys all the plans of Atina, the ship 
captain who rescued him; yet within a 
day, Atina has forgiven him and agreed 
to follow him on his seemingly insane 
quest to the north. Not that Strickland 
couldn’t have made this work — ^but it 
takes many pages, scenes, and trans- 
formations of character to bring it off. 
Scenes that Just weren’t there. 

Still, 1 was already hooked; so I grit- 
ted my teeth, swallowed deeply, and 
went on. I’m glad 1 did. The novel is 
so good before that point, and so good 
after, that I quickly forgot my moment 
of unbelief and raced on to the end. 
Strickland will write better books in 
the future, but don’t wait till then — he’s 



already good, and TO STAND BE- 
NEATH 'THE SUN is better than a 
first novel has any right to be. 

FREEDOM BEACH is only half a 
first novel. John Kessel, one of the co- 
authors (and a Nebula-winning short 
story writer), makes his debut as a 
novelist with this book; the other co- 
author, James Patrick Kelly, previously 
published PLANET OF WHISPERS 
(a first-rate novel with a cover so em- 
barrassingly bad that hiding it inside 
copies of Hustler will make you look 
like you have better taste). 

I was a httle leery of this book. Parts 
of it had already appeared as short 
stories. Excellent short stories, mind 
you — but I could not conceive of a way 
that “The Big Dream" and “The Empty 
World” could make sense in the same 
novel as “Freedom Beach.” 

Kelly and Kessel brought it off per- 
fectly. Shaun, the main character, finds 
himself in a rehabilitation center on a 
bench, where life is fim and games — as 
long as you don’t attempt to write any- 
thing. Therapy consists of powerful 
dreams. Until Shaun’s lover dies, and 
he tries to swim away, and then discov- 
ers that sometimes you can wake up 
from reality more easily than you can 
wake up from a dream. 

Unlike most writers who try to write 
dreams, Kelly and Kessel managed to 
make all the dream sequences clear 
and intrinsically interesting. One 
dream in particular, which inexplica- 
bly never found a publisher as the 
separate story “Faustfeathers,” is the 
funniest Marx Brothers comedy never 
filmed. (You haven’t lived till you’ve 
seen John Kessel, Greg Frost, and 
Marx Van Name do an interpretive 
reading, with wigs.) 

The unconnected stories connect; 
the inexplicable is explained; and by 
the end, Kessel and Kelly have made 
all the strange melodies come together

in a single grand harmonious chord. 

The best science fiction, I believe, 
is a blend of exuberant myth, believa- 
ble characters and setting, and clear, 
compelling writing. All three of these 
novels admirably join these traits — but 
the flavor is different in each case. 
SANTIAGO leans toward myth; TO 
STAND BENEATH THE SUN con 
centrates more on realism of character 
and setting; FREEDOM BEACH de- 
votes more attention to literary art. But 
all are exemplary science fiction. 

Briefly Noted Science 
Fiction: 

William Gibson’s NECROMAN- 
CER won just about every award they 
give, primarily because of Gibson’s vig- 
orous style and his believable, well-ex- 
trapolated near-future setting. Sup- 
posedly he is representative of a style 
of writing called “Cyberpunk” because 
of its melding of artificial intelligence 
with burned-out, drug-blown punk cul- 
ture. The trouble is that when you look 
for other exemplars of the Cyberpunk 
movement, nobody but Gibson really 
belongs. It ain’t every writer who can 
be a whole movement aU by himself. 

So even though I didn’t care for 
some things about NECROMANCER, 
I do urge you to check out Gibson’s 
story collection BURNING 
CHROME. Don't try to read the 
stories aU in one sitting — you might 
have to be hospitalized. He writes with 
such energy that you can strip your 
gears just trying to keep up. 

Christopher Winn’s LEGAL DAISY 
SPACING is being marketed as 
humor. And it is bitingly funny. It is 
also, by implication at least, cosmic sf 
It consists of regulations and helpful 
suggestions for running your universe. 
Nothing can describe it, so I will quote 
from the description of A Cloud Deten- 
tion Centre: “Clouds are disgustingly 



incontinent and most unpredictable in 
the shelter they provide from the harm- 
ful rays of the sun. Detain in Approved 
Centres.” Or this one: “Uphold the 
Laws of Decency at all times and keep 
those deciduous trees well covered. 
Handy tree screens can be obtained in 
a wide variety of sympathetic finishes 
like this attractive leatherette.” Or 
maybe you just have to read the 
book — or at least look at the pictures. 

Philip K. Dick wrote RADIO FREE 
ALBEMUTH in the mid-1970s, his first 
attempt to deal with material that later 
became Valis. Now, years after his 
death, the semi-autobiographical novel 
is appearing for the first time. 

Usually if an author failed to publish 
a finished work while he was still alive, 
it’s because the work wasn’t very good. 
Not this time. RADIO FREE AlL- 
BEMUTH falls into that little triangle 
where bitter satire, painful realism, 
and desperate madness overlap. If you 
already loved Dick’s work, of course 
you’ll read this book. If, like me, you 
had not read much of his work before, 
this is a good place to start. In a sen- 
tence? This is the kind of book Von- 
negut would write if he ever stopped 
talking to himself. 

You can follow ALBEMUTH by 
reading ONLY APPARENTLY REAL: 
THE WORLD OF PHILIP K. DICK, 
by Paul Williams, the executor of 
Dick’s literary estate. It is the kind of 
book you’d expect from a friend and 
disciple who is himself a talented 
writer — both worshipful and intelli- 
gent, able to explain to outsiders like 
me what it was that Dick’s devotees 
loved about his work. It makes fas- 
cinating reading in its own right, even 
if, like me, you are generally unfamiliar 
with Dick’s work. 

It also had a strange effect on me 
as a writer. At times I felt enormous 
relief that, by comparison with Dick, I 



The Light Fantastic 



23 




lead a happy, normal life. Yet 1 also 
recognized that Dick had achieved 
exactly the effect that every writer 
yearns for — not just to be read, but to 
be believed. He built a community of 
people who loved his work, passed it 
hand to hand, reread it many times, 
and lived, to some degree, by its pre- 
cepts. Any storyteller who says “All I 
want to do is entertain” is a liar — we 
want to change the world. More spec- 
ifically, we want you to live in our 
world and like it. It is that accomplish- 
ment that makes a writer’s work en- 
dure after his death. What made me a 
bit uneasy was the question that if 
Dick, in his comparative madness and 
misery, achieved what we all long for, 
does that imply that the very stability 
of my life dooms me to failure as an 
artist? Don’t send me letters trying to 
answer that. 

George R.R. Martin’s TUF VOYAG- 
ING is a collection of short works that 
appeared in magazines — mostly in 
Analog during 1985. Now, in book 
form, they flow together to make a 
coherent, interesting, entertaining 
story. Haviland Tuf is a tall, bald, 
peaceful, arrogant cat-lover — the kind 
of person you’d hate to have as a co- 
worker or neighbor, and as unlikely an 
adventurer as I’ve seen in science fic- 
tion. Yet he not only escapes death and 
iryury, but also defeats his enemies and 
wins all the prizes of war without actu- 
ally doing anything much himself Be- 
cause Tuf is so austere, you aren’t 
going to get terribly emotionally in- 
volved. But you wiU be delighted, I 
believe. 

Carter Scholz has to be one of the 
most determinedly literary writers 
ever to publish within the sf genre. He 
is also one of the most brilliant. The 
result is that readers who are willing 
to work a little harder, to exercise their 
own imaginations, can receive stories 



of startling emotional and intellectual 
force. Chris Drumm, who provides a 
great service to the science fiction field 
by publishing short works by excellent 
but overlooked writers, has published 
some of Scholz’s best stories in the 
small booklet CUTS. It is outrageous 
that only one of these stories was 
purchased by a m^or sf editor. 
Perhaps it’s because many of the best 
are stories only by implication — ^you 
have to infer the story by reading be- 
tween the lines of the document Scholz 
presents. ‘The Translator,” for in- 
stance, is a nastily ironic apologia by 
the man who made his career translat- 
ing the works of a second-rate foreign 
writer into first-rate English; “Players, 
or Some Problems of Form in New 
York” is a critical review of New York 
and, by extension, the entire Earth, as 
if it were a work of art by a rather mad 
artist; “How Should We Celebrate the 
Bicentennial?” is a government agency 
memo that finally reveals itself to be 
a hilarious yet bitter cry from the 
depths of the bureaucracy. There are 
other fine stories. There are also some 
unfortunate examples of literary self- 
indulgence, but you could spend a lot 
more and come away with a lot less — 
and no doubt you will, at least a dozen 
times this year. 

By rights I should have hated David 
Drake’s BRIDGEHEAD. There were 
so many characters running around 
that by the end I couldn’t remember 
who half of them were — a sure sign 
that a writer has done a lousy job of 
making the characters real. So why, 
when 1 was wearily driving home from 
Chattanooga last January, did I stop — 
for lunch, I thought — and end up read- 
ing BRIDGEHEAD from cover to 
cover before I drove another inch? It’s 
ostensibly the story of time travelers 
who set up a transfer station in an 
American university. But the plot gets

IF 




a lot thicker and takes some wonderful 
turns before the end. I was three hours 
late getting home — but the book was 
worth it. 

David Hartwell’s AGE OF WON- 
DERS is the best book about science 
fiction that I’ve read. It manages to be 
intelligent, fascinating, and readable, 
and it helps put into perspective the 
whole world of sf during the three gen- 
erations it has existed as a recogniza- 
ble genre. 

For historical interest only, you 
might want to take a look at THE 
JOHN W. CAMPBELL LETTERS. 
Campbell was the writer and editor 
who can be said to have created “hard 
science fiction” in the 1940s and 1950s. 
Browsing through the book at random, 
you get a picture of Campbell’s re- 
lationship with many writers during 
the 1950s. Unfortunately, there are few 
letters fi-om before that decade, and 
the letters are rarely of earthshaking 
importance. But since we’re still build- 
ing on the foundation he laid for us, 
it’s nice to get a look at how Campbell 
went about laying it . 

Fantasy Books: The New 
Humanism 

What Tolkien did was wonderful, be- 
cause it grew out of his intense involve- 
ment with real ancient languages and 
his profound conversion to Catholi- 
cism. Because these strong beliefs pro- 
vided the root of his mythic Lord of 
the Rings, he could get away with 
characters who were usually nothing 
more than token representatives of a 
species (a dwarf is a dwarf, an elf is 
an elf), at best two-dimensional icons 
(Aragorn, the hero in disguise; Frodo, 
Samwise, and GoUum, the three faces 
of the common man). The characters 
were not “real,” but their story was 
truthful, since it was drawn from Tol- 
kien’s deepest loves and beliefs. 



Unfortunately, Tolkien’s imitators 
had no root except in Tolkien’s epic. 
It never works, but people still try to 
write great fiction by copying the su- 
perficial attributes of a great work of 
fiction. MUton did not write Paradise 
Lost by copying Spenser; he wrote it 
out of his fervent belief in the Puritan 
version of Christianity, whose central 
myth was the Fall. Chaucer didn’t try 
to write a new Song of Roland; instead 
he put English romances into the 
mouths of common English folk. 
Shakespeare forged other people’s 
stories into his plays — ^but he changed 
them into utterly believable English 
characters. 

Now, it may be that you weren’t dis- 
satisfied with the flood of Tolkien im- 
itators that was followed by a flood of 
Howard imitators that was followed 
by a flood of tedious Dungeons-and- 
Dragons fictioneers laced with fire- 
quent feminist role reversals that 
showed that fantasy women could be 
written about just as stupidly as fan- 
tasy men. Never mind that you had to 
put check marks on the cover to re- 
member which books you had already 
read. There was enough raping and 
magic and hacking and tricking to keep 
you happy while you ate your Twin- 
kies. 

But if, like me, you wanted Romance 
in the great English tradition, grit 
mixed with glory; if you wanted stories 
you could chew on, stories that stayed 
with you, stories that could be be- 
lieved, set in worlds you could live in, 
you didn’t have all that many choices. 
There were a few writers doing power- 
ful, substantive work, or at least at- 
tempting it: Patricia McKilip, 

Evangeline Walton, Ursula K. LeGuin, 
Jane Yolen, Stephen R. Donaldson. 

It wasn’t always easy to find them. 
Surprisingly, some of the best fantasies 
were published in hardcover as “young 



The Light Fantastic 



25 




adult books,” even though they were 
far more grown-up than the endless 
strong-thewed barbarians (with or 
without floppy chests) and the parade 
of tacky unicorns and woodsy elves 
that flooded the supposedly adult fan- 
tasy market. (Don’t get me wrong — 1 
epjoyed Leiber’s Fafhrd and the Grey 
Mouser series, I had a story of my own 
in a Swords Against Darkness anthol- 
ogy. Karl Edward Wagner and Gerald 
Page proved that sword and sorcery 
could be done well. But it was hard to 
find the jewels in the dross). 

What was 1 looking for in fantasy? 
Believability, folks. Realism. 

— Wait a minute. In fantasy? The 
whole point of fantasy is that it isn’t 
realistic! 

Wrong, Bonzo. The whole point of 
fantasy is that it takes place in a world 
where the laws of nature are different. 
But it can still be presented realisti- 
cally. 

That’s why I liked McKillip and Wal- 
ton and Donaldson — ^they were trying 
to be honest, trying to create real 
human beings in a world where power 
is more than politics or plug-in machin- 
ery. That’s why 1 liked Yolen and Le- 
Guin — they were trying to tell, in smeill, 
intense stories, the kind of truth that 
is usually wrestled with in massive 
novels. 

I’m pleased to tell you that now there 
is a new generation of writers doing 
exactly the things 1 wished for all 
along. And some of those who were 
turning out barbarian or elf stories 
have grown up a little. The result is a 
crop of fantasts who are writing tales 
you can believe in. Many of them are 
shunning the traditional Medieval 
European setting; others are simply 
doing Medieval settings properly — the 
way the Middle English Romanticists 
did it. 

Call it Humanist Fantasy. Worlds 



where magic isn’t the answer, it’s the 
question; and human beings, the 
human community, are the only ones 
who can resolve it. 

Megan Lindholm’s WIZARD OF 
THE PIGEONS is the most surprising 
of the Humanist Fantasies. Her tale is 
set among the street people of Seattle, 
and her picture of the scavenging life 
is so realistic you’ll feel like you’ve 
lived there yourself. Her main charac- 
ter, Wizard, a bummed-out Vietnam 
veteran, is not scavenging because he’s 
a failure. In fact, his scavenging is part 
of a set of stringent rules he follows 
that give him magical powers — ^par- 
ticularly the ability to help people set 
their lives straight. Instead of the 
magic staff, he has a popcorn bag that 
always seems to be full of pigeon feed. 
Instead of incantations, he follows 
rules — like never carrying with him 
more than a dollar in coins. 

Most of the way through, the story 
was miraculously good. It weakened 
at the end, unfortunately, because 
Lindhohn made the fatal error of hav- 
ing a vague, amorphous, fog-like Evil 
Force as Wizard’s ultimate enemy. The 
grey fog was around from the begin- 
ning, but Wizard’s most immediate 
enemy was a takecharge waitress from 
a cafe who knocked him out of his 
routines and possessed him. She was 
a believable antagonist. The grey fog 
was a cheap special effect. 

Never mind the flaw; most of the 
novel is so real, so original that you 
won’t regret buying it and reading it. 
And maybe you don’t share my anti-fog 
prejudice, in which case WIZARD OF 
THE PIGEONS is perfect. 

Stephen Brust’s BROKEDOWN 
PALACE takes place in a labyrinthine 
palace that is in the last stages of 
decay, leading to imminent collapse. It 
is a daring thing for a fantast to call 
forth comparisons with Peake’s Ghor- 



26 



IF 




mengast books — ^but Brust brings it 
off. 

Miklos is the youngest of the sons 
of the late king of Fenario. His eldest 
brother, Laszlo, is king now — and he 
has tried to murder Miklos. The boy’s 
life is saved by a talking horse (I know, 
I know — hated the talking horse at 
first, too. But be patient — it becomes 
a marvelous character by the end), and 
he goes off to Faerie to learn. 

He returns with magical powers, and 
knows he must, somehow, save the 
collapsing palace. But Laszlo regards 
it as treason even to suggest that the 
palace needs repair, and Miklos nearly 
loses his life more than once. In the 
meantime, a tiny seed has taken root 
in the palace, drinking the water of the 
river, growing until it threatens to rip 
the palace to pieces the way tree roots 
tear up sidewalks. 

The novel begins a little archly — ^the 
author addresses the reader directly, 
and the structure is at first fragmented 
and unclear. This is not a flaw, merely 
an obstacle. Give the book a chance. 
Get into the flow of Brust’s language. 
He’ll reward you for it. 

You’ll hve with a family that makes 
A Lion in Winter and \^o’s Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf? look like a 
weekend with the Bobbsey Twins. The 
palace itself is a brooding, powerful, 
helpless character, whose death and 
resurrection is as powerful an event 
as I’ve seen in fantasy. Medieval? Yes, 
and in that sense BROKEDOWN 
PALACE is traditional. Traditional, 
but never, not for a moment, ordinary. 

With his novel TAIN, Gregory Frost 
returns to a time-honored fantasy tra- 
dition: reviving ancient sagas and re- 
telling them in a form that modern 
readers can grasp. 1 suppose you could 
dismiss it as a war that began over a 
cattle raid. But then, it isn’t just any 
cow they’re stealing, and not Just any- 



body out to steal it. Frost assembles 
as perverse a crew of heroic characters 
as you’re likely to find. In fact, the only 
book TAIN can properly be compared 
with right now is Resnick’s SAN- 
TIAGO — in scope, purpose, and 
technique Frost and Resnick set them- 
selves much the same task. Frost suc- 
ceeded, too, to a remarkable degree. 

In fact, the only real problem with 
TAIN is that Frost has chosen to tell 
the story through a frame. Laeg, a dead 
hero, returns to life in order to lead a 
young man named Senchan through a 
series of visions. Senchan and Laeg are 
engaging characters, but Frost never 
does a thing with them. It is in the 
visions that the real story is told. It 
was fhistrating when it finally became 
clear that Senchan was never going to 
be more than a mere device, like the 
little boy at the end of the musical 
Camelot, whose sole purpose for 
existing is to remember Arthur and tell 
stories about the Round Table. 

So concentrate on the tales that Sen- 
chan witnesses, starting with a pair of 
jealous Pigkeepers of the Gods and 
winding through a cast of unforgetta- 
ble, all-too-human characters. Not 
since Evangeline Walton’s Mabinogion 
has there been such a marvelous 
straightforward retelling of an ancient 
national myth. 

Will Shetterly’s WITCH BLOOD 
suffers from the Kung-Fu syndrome, 
in that it gets serious about choreog- 
raphed self-defense routines as a Way 
of Life Leading to Brotherhood and Ul- 
timate Happiness. Many a book has 
died a miserable death because it de- 
pended on the reader actually believ- 
ing the mystic twaddle surrounding aU 
the kicking and poking and grunting. 
Kung-Fu movies all look the same to 
me. 

Fortunately, though Shetterly uses 
these mystic arts, they are never the 



The Light Fantastic 



27 




main thrust of the book. It is instead 
the tale of Rifkin, a wanderer who gets 
caught up in the defense of one of the 
last strongholds of the Witches, who 
once ruled a great empire but now are 
being overcome by iron and gunpow- 
der. Rifkin is a wisecracking free spirit 
who gives his loyalty only rarely, and 
only on his own terms. As he butts 
heads with the Witches — who are not 
always Nice People — we discover that 
he is both more and less than he seems 
to be. The result is a funny, exciting 
adventure story that delighted me from 
beginning to end. (Predictably, the 
cover of the book is embarrassing and 
the cover blurbs completely mislead- 
ing about the story within.) 

And don’t kid yourself. Real humor 
is hard to write, Shetterly does a good 
job. Oh, now and then he repeats a 
running gag too soon or too often; now 
and then Rifkin is too aware that he’s 
funny, like a comedian who breaks up 
over his own jokes. But these are 
momentary lapses in a well-sustained 
comic adventure novel. 

What I really have to warn you about 
is the fact that this book is obviously 
the first in a series, even though it 
never says so. Still, it’s worth reading 
now — the immediate story is fully re- 
solved at the end, so instead of feeling 
disappointed or annoyed, you’ll be 
pleased to realize that there’s more to 
come. 

M. Coleman Easton may be the least 
flamboyant of the writers of Humanist 
Fantasy. His MASTERS OF GLASS 
last year was not the kind of stunning 
first novel that catapults a writer to 
instant fame. It was a small, quiet, pri- 
vate little book. This year, his novel 
ISKIIR reaches for a bit more of the 
grand scale, and no doubt Easton will 
get even more ambitious as time goes 
on. Still, I hope that he never loses his 
knack for creating character with 



seeming artlessness. He never calls at- 
tention to himself as a writer. And yet 
when I’m through reading his books, I 
feel like I’ve known real people, lived 
through real events. 

ISKIIR is set in a non-European 
milieu — it feels somewhat Arabian. A 
vast circle of monolithic stones ap- 
pears suddenly around the city. Young 
Iskiir is the only one in town who rec- 
ognizes the immediate danger, for he 
is one of a handful of survivors of a 
similar incident in his mountain village 
years before. The monoliths draw 
steadily closer to the city, making es- 
cape nearly impossible, crushing any- 
thing in their path. As the mages prove 
their inability to halt the stones, Iskiir 
and his friend, an unusually incompe- 
tent mage, find a way out of the city 
to find the one wizard who knows how 
to stop the stones. 

In the meantime, his young beloved, 
Adeh, remains in the city, where she 
catches the perpetrators of a grain- 
stealing scheme. We travel among pil- 
grims on an insane perpetual pil- 
grimage, join a band of desert raiders, 
and take part in a climactic battle in 
which Iskiir plays a vital role. 

Nothing in ISKIIR will take you out 
of your chair the way that more ambi- 
tious novels might; but neither does 
Easton make a false step. While you 
live in his world, you’re in the hands 
of a masterful, talented writer; you can 
trust him to deliver what he promises. 
There’s much to be said for quiet excel- 
lence. 

Robert Holdstock’s MYTHAGO 
WOOD has already won the World 
Fantasy Award, and it is as deserving 
a choice as they’ve ever made. It begins 
slowly, as the narrator, Steve, a young 
English war veteran, returns to live in 
the home his domineering father left 
to Christian, Steve’s older brother. 
Their father devoted his life to an ob- 



28 



IF 




sessive study of the ancient forest ad- 
joining their house. Gradually, Steve 
discovers that the small wood, only a 
few miles around, is much larger inside 
than out; and dwelling within the wood 
is a woman who once loved his father 
and now loves him. He also learns that 
there are dangers in the wood — and 
he cannot hide from them in his safe 
and civilized house any longer. They 
will come to him if he does not go 
destroy them at their source. 

Some have criticized the book be- 
cause it take so long to get to the “good 
parts” — that is, most of the book takes 
place outside the wood, and only in 
the latter part does Steve enter the 
magical forest and have the sort of ad- 
venture we usually associate with fan- 
tasy. In a sense, that criticism is really 
flattery — such readers wanted the 
novel to go on. In another sense, 
though, the criticism is merely ignor- 
ant. The long, slow passage of time 
through the first 157 pages is abso- 
lutely necessary to set up the last 95 
pages. 

It’s like chase scenes in film or TV. 
Sure, they can be exciting — ^but most 
of the excitement comes from know- 
ing who is being chased, and who is 
chasing them, and what it will mean if 
they’re caught. Like The Dukes of 
Hazzard, which gave the audience 
only enough story to provide an excuse 
for the chases. The empty, meaningless 
action may be exciting the first few 
times, but eventually it all starts to look 
the same. 

That’s what’s been wrong with so 
many bad fantasies for so many years: 
They don’t take the time, as Holdstock 
has done, to earn the action scenes, to 
invest them with meaning. Just battles 
with steel and spells, one after the 
other, with only the feeblest threads 
of plot and character to hold them to- 
gether. MYTHAGO WOOD is for 



grown-ups. It’s for readers who are 
willing to take the time and effort to 
let a writer evoke a whole and believ- 
able world, peopled with living charac- 
ters. 

Briefly Noted Fantasy: 

You’ve been good. You drank all 
your milk, you cut back on your vices 
(candy bars? cigarets? bad sci-fi 
novels?), and you didn’t kick the neigh- 
bor’s filthy annoying cat. So reward 
yourself with one of these three excel- 
lent story collections. (But only one — 
you haven’t been that good.) 

LIAVEK, edited by WUl Shetterly 
and Emma Bull, is a shared world an- 
thology. It’s an art form launched in 
Robert Asprin’s Thieves’ World 
books, wherein several writers con- 
tribute short stories set in the same 
city, and there have already been many 
attempts to create other shared 
worlds. Some of these shared worlds 
are pretty weak — Magic in Ithkar 
springs to mind — and others, like 
Greystone Bay, contain many good 
stories, but don’t really develop the 
possibilities of the world they share. 

LIAVEK, on the other hand, is an 
example of what can be accomplished 
when almost everything goes right. As 
could be expected, the two most re- 
nowned writers in the book. Gene 
Wolfe and Jane Yolen, contribute first- 
rate stories. But their stories pretty 
much stand alone; it is the work of 
lesser-known writers that interweave 
to make the city of Liavek come to life. 
Stephen Brust, Emma Bull, Will Shet- 
terly, and Barry Longyear wrote excel- 
lent tales — ^but here’s the shocker: 
There isn’t a single bad story in the 
book. In fact, every story is at least 
presentable, and most are downright 
good. More than that I will not say — ex-

INTRODGCTION 

TO PROLOGUE TO FREEDOM 



Almost three decades ago, the then Russian leader, Nikita Krushchev, 
on his way home from a visit to America, stopped over in Yugoslavia 
to see Tito, the leader of that Communist country. 

It could have been a great moment in history, because Tito for the 
most part talked the best sense of any Communist leader, and acted on 
his own ideas. 

What he said, essentially, to his Russian peer was: “Nikita, you can 
safely open your borders, and let the people come and go. The reason 
why it’s safe is that you can be sure no other country wants 278 million 
Russians. In fact, they don’t even want fifteen million Yugoslavs.” 

But Tito’s borders reflected his thinking: they were open. Thousands 
of Yugoslavians crossed over into Germany and the rest of Europe, 
looking for jobs. When they found work, they sent part of the money 
home to help support their families, and it is even possible, as a result 
of cross marriages, that some of them managed to stay abroad. But for 
most of the individuals involved, presently their visas expired; where- 
upon they came back to their own country, whether reluctantly or 
otherwise made no difference. 

Returning to Moscow, Krushchev suggested to the Russian leadership 
that Tito’s was a good example to follow. His words — it was reported 
at the time — were greeted in stony silence by the hardcore Stalinists; 
and, shortly thereafter, Krushchev was the victim of a power takeover, 
and, though not executed, was ever after ignored, and lived in retirement. 

In Yugoslavia, after Tito died, a similar hardcore group seems to have 
taken over; and Yugoslavians are no longer allowed to go abroad. 

In view of ever more serious world tension, I really think a return to 
Tito’s idea might release a lot of the grim emotion that could even, in 
an extreme, lead to a nuclear war.

IF 




Looking back a few years, imagine if at the time Vietnam was split 
in two, if both Vietnamese governments had agreed to easy border 
crossing regulations which both sides would enforce. And, similarly, 
imagine if, right now, all those reluctant Communist states in east Europe 
also had open borders, with regulated travel back and forth. Remember; 
the key thought is no country would ever permit more than a small 
percentage of individuals to cross over at any given time, and would 
presently require them to move on, or go home. 

Anyway, that’s the situation I wanted to dramatize in my story, “Pro- 
logue to Freedom”, assuming throughout that human nature, capitalist 
and communist, never changes. 

I really think it would work out there in the real world. And I believe 
our diplomacy should try to move our dangerously divided world in 
that direction. 

Taking for granted that human nature has not changed in recorded 
history, my story dramatizes this concept.

A state, I said, arises, as I con- 
ceive, out of the needs of man- 
kind; no (me is self-sufficing, 
but all of us have many wants. 
Can any other origin of a state 
be imagined? 

Plato, 427-347 B.C. 

2004 A.D. 

For more than two decades ca- 
pable government advisers had au- 
thored rules of survival, requiring 
the most profligate populace on 
the planet to operate sensibly. 

So that, despite the energy shor- 
tage, planes still flew. Everybody 
still had his car. A proper diet was 
available for rich or poor. And this 
condition of temperate living could 
have gone on indefinitely, despite 
the usual multi-millions of sly eva- 
sions. 

It turned out that the dwellers 
in paradise were angrier than was 
realized. In California (where else 
would it begin but in earth’s only 
heaven?) in the election of 2004, 
Proposition 8 passed with a major- 
ity vote of 67%. 

(Only 19% voted against; the re- 
maining 14% of those who went to 

32 IF 



the polls simply left that item un- 
marked.) 

The business community, which 
had fought 8 with the biggest ex- 
penditure in the history of state 
elections, was stunned. At once 
there was a wild scramble to get 
out of San Francisco. 

Actually, the scramble did not 
include everyone. Ed Clint, TV re- 
porter from New York, who ques- 
tioned people in various walks of 
life, estimated that approximately 
forty per cent of those who had 
voted for Proposition 8, didn’t 
know what it was. (“But something 
had to be done — ” they said.) 

Portions of this group and of 
other segments of the California 
population expressed a popular 
reaction: “If the Big Boys are 
scared of it, then it’s got to be 
okay.” 

In the area of intellect where 
Sam Mebley operated his little 
grocery store in South San Fran- 
cisco there was a mood of nega- 
tive, uneasy vagueness. Meaning 
Sam did not have a clear picture 
of what would happen after the 
three-month transition time. How-

ever, he was not too disturbed. 
During the pre-election, a small 
group of U.C. students came to 
each store on his street with reas- 
suring statements. Sam was not 
quite sure what it was they said. 
But the shoe store owner down the 
street expressed himself as being 
greatly cheered. As he interpreted 
the student message for Sam, “All 
competent small business people 
will be encouraged to carry on.” 

Sam, who had more than a quar- 
ter of a million in hidden funds, 
had a secret feeling of total compe- 
tence. And, besides, he rented his 
building and owed for most of his 
stock. So what the hell! 

He didn’t mention the hidden 
hoard when he was interviewed by 
Clint before the election. But he 
did report what the students had 
said, and that evening he described 
his casual, dismissing attitude to 
Stella, his every-other-night bed 
companion, adding: “In this world 
you’ve got to be smarter than the 
next guy.” 

For Sam, being smarter meant 
than each weekend on Sunday 
night he took the train to Los 
Angeles. (He could have flown, but 
for that you had to give your name 
and attest that it was a necessary 
trip.) 

So after an all-night journey Sam 
reached his desination Monday 
morning. His principal task: to rent 
three or four safety deposit boxes 
in outlying branches of different 
banks and place in each a bundle 
of cash. 

By evening he was on the train 
again, and on his way back to San 

34 IF 



Francisco. 

During the first four weekends 
there was no problem. But as he 
was returning on his fifth Monday 
night, the long passenger train with 
its puffing steam locomotive rolled 
to a stop Just outside of Bakers- 
field. A trio of students came 
aboard Sam’s car. Sam, who had 
been sleeping with his head against 
the window, had his first aware- 
ness of something new when he 
was shaken awake. It took a little 
while, then, but basically he was 
quick and obliging. 

“Sure, sure — what’s the prob?” 
The interrogation trio told him. 
Sam nodded. “Oh, yeah, I get it. 
This is a check-up on who crosses 
the new border.” 

Quickly, he gave his name, 
stated his occupation, and gave his 
made-up explanation: “Kind’ve 

running out of supplies. So 1 
thought I’d go down and see if I 
could get some of the stuff I 
needed.” He added, “Got a few 
boxes of canned goods up in the 
express car.” 

That passed him. But it was ob- 
vious: his time was running out. 

And he still had $113,000 in 
stashed cash to get to safety de- 
posit boxes in the second 
economic area. 

“When the words 'mine' and 
‘thine' had entered into the 
world and conflicts arose 
among citizens concerning 
ownership of things, and be- 
tween neighboring peoples over 
boundaries, it became custom- 
ary to have recourse to some one 
who wouldjustly and effectively 




see that the poor suffered no vio- 
lence from the rich, or the whole 
people from their neighbors. ”

In that first month or so a great 
deal of information was available 
from all news media. 

It seemed that experts were 
being brought to San FYancisco 
from the U.S.S.R. as advisors. Their 
first task — it was reported — was to 
gain control of the flow of goods, 
particularly of the food supply. 

As, during the second month, the 
news rapidly grew less, it became 
obvious they were also getting con- 
trol of the flow of information. 

The food part, Sam noted early. 
His credit wholesalers cut him off 
from new supplies. But goods were 
still available for cash; and in fact 
several wholesalers came to him 
and offered him secret stores that 
they had if he would pay off in cash 
for what he owed them. Each man 
intimated he would accept a sub- 
stantial discount as payment in 
full. 

It turned out, in the consequent 
discussion, that some of these 
people were still hopeful that the 
government in Washington would 
interfere against Proposition 8. But 
a few days later both San Fran- 
cisco newspapers quoted a govern- 
ment spokesman. It was a state- 
ment issued by the White House, 
and it said: 

“All over the world for a genera- 
tion or more. Capitalism and Com- 
munism have been confronting 
each other. Until now, citizens of 



either group have been able to mi- 
grate into the other’s territory only 
with great difficulty, and seldom 
with the privilege of returning un- 
scathed, when and if they desired 
to do so. But now in what was the 
great state of California we shall 
be able to observe in a relatively 
small arena what happens when 
there is easy access and easy re- 
turn by law. It wiU also be interest- 
ing to observe if the new dual sys- 
tem will automatically cure the 
negative aspects of human nature, 
as the promoters of Proposition 8 
have claimed.” 

Sam had two reactions to that. 
First was the sarcastic thought: 
“Boy, those advisors sure let that 
item be printed.” Belatedly, later 
in the day, came the second feeling. 
A puzzlement: “For Pete’s sake, 
what is this Proposition 8?” 

That evening, en route to his 
own house, he pulled over to a curb 
in front of a smaU shack on the 
same street. Got out. Walked up to 
the unpainted door. And knocked. 

Presently, there was the wrink- 
led, chunky woman who, daytimes, 
did housecleaning for people who 
did not wish to make out employer 
social security statements about 
occasional domestic help; and 
thus — as Sam had learned — since 
there was no record of her having 
an income, she was able to collect 
monthly welfare checks. 

Sam said, “I’ve had a rough day, 
Stella. And though this isn’t our 
regular time. I’ll need a woman to- 
night.” 

Stella peered up at him. Not 
much up; they were fairly nearly 



Prologue to Freedom 



35 




the same height. For many seconds 
her dark eyes promised nothing. 
Then: “I’ll see how I feel,” she said 
finally, “and maybe come over.” 

Sam departed without argu- 
ment. The plain, little woman gen- 
erally treated him with compas- 
sion. Whenever she didn’t “feel” 
like it she was usually willing “to 
take care of’ him. 

As he fully expected, she arrived 
about eight o’clock; and they had 
a drink. And somewhere, then, 
came Sam’s question. 

Stella didn’t argue, or express 
surprise that he didn’t know what 
it was he had voted for. She was 
a woman who, as a girl, had looked 
into a mirror. At which time she 
had the first of many ego-diminish- 
ing shocks. So that getting this 
plump-faced small man had been 
a better-than-average for a face 
like hers. 

However, like most women she 
noticed the awesome limitations of 
her man without — since they were 
not married — taunting him with 
his stupidity. 

So she explained Proposition 8 
being careful the while not to make 
him feel like an idiot for having 
paid no attention to the most im- 
portant election of his, or any 
Californian’s lifetime. 

The proposition split California 
in two just south of Bakersfield. 
The southern portion, with Los 
Angeles as its capital, would have 
a capitalistic economy. The north- 
ern half, with San Francisco as the 
capital, would have a Marxist eco- 
nomy. 

Inhabitants of both economic 



areas would use the same money. 
They could migrate from one area 
to the other as many times as they 
pleased, but would be subject to 
the laws of whichever section they 
chose to live in. 

When she had finished, Sam sat 
frowning for a while; then: “This 
Marxist thing — it’s what they’ve 
got in Russia, uh, the U.S.S.R.?” 
The woman nodded, yes. “The 
idea,” he said, “is that eveiything 
is owned by the people.” She 
added, “I don’t quite know how 
they make sure it’s all evenly split. 
But that’s the idea.” 

After a small pause, Sam said, 
“Oh!” He was thinking of his 
$113,000. in cash being divided 
among the fourteen million people 
who lived in Economic Area 
Number One. His feeling was nega- 
tive. 

“You going to stay?” Stella 
asked. 

“I’ll have to look the situation 
over,” replied Sam, “and that may 
take a while. I got most of that 3- 
month transition period still to go.” 
It turned out that it didn’t take 
quite as long as the words, “trans- 
ition period” had, somehow, im- 
plied. Or rather, it had not occurred 
to Sam that he might be a subject 
for one of the changes made as a 
part of the transition. 

“fr is plain, therefore, that the 
distingushing quality of hu- 
manity is the faculty or the 
power of understanding. ” 

Dante, 1265-1321 AD. 

In both papers the following day, 
the entire front page was an adver- 



36 



IF 




tisement. It requested — the actual 
phrase used was: “are re- 

quested” — all college students to 
register “at once” with the Depart- 
ment of Transitional Actions. 

Elsewhere in the ad was the 
statement that “qualifying” college 
graduates would be given the avail- 
able “higher paying jobs.” 

Presumably, all those college in- 
tellectuals would understand that 
there was nothing coercive in the 
request; and that the wording 
merely implied how urgent was the 
need, as, presumably, was the 
statement that those who regis- 
tered first would naturally have the 
choice of the best positions. 

It was the shoe store owner from 
down the street who showed Sam 
the advertisement. He seemed vis- 
ibly less cheerful. “What they want 
to do is get the intellectuals on 
their side. That was what my son 
said. He’s going down this morn- 
ing.” 

Sam said, “You got a college edu- 
cation, Harry?” 

“Well — no. But I put my son 
through.” He added, “I had a living 
to make.” 

“Me, too,” said Sam. 

It was two days after that con- 
versation that Sam looked up from 
a small transaction with old Mrs. 
Spidley. What he noticed was a car 
with the words, PROPOSITION 8, 
in large letters. And under it, some- 
what smaller, was Department of 
Transitional Actions. 

The car was in the action of 
pulling up in front of his door. 

As he saw, one after the other, 
three men get out, Sam uncon- 



sciously began bracing himself. 
And, as the men walked towards 
the entrance of his store and then 
came inside, he uttered one small 
sigh of regret. It was mid-after- 
noon. All through the day, every 
hour he had taken his cash accru- 
als for that hour, and had hidden 
the money in a specific place he 
had at the back of the small build- 
ing. What elicited the sigh was that 
the current hour had just run its 
course; and he had intended to 
take care of those accruals in ap- 
proximately one minute. 

One of the three men was quite 
young: early 20s. He carried a black 
executive case, and he preceded 
the other two. The second in line 
was about fifty, and Number Three 
was fortyish. All three were Middle 
Class types. 

The youngest placed his case on 
the counter in front of Sam, and 
said, “My name is Paul Vakor. Are 
you Mr. Sam Mebley?” 

He didn’t wait for a reply, but 
went on, “We’ve come to take over 
your store for the good of the 
people.” 

Sam did a special inner bracing 
job. And said, “Hey, I thought com- 
petent small business guys would 
be allowed to continue operat- 
ing their small businesses in 
Economic Area One.” 

As his first answer the youth 
stepped over in front of his execu- 
tive case, and opened it. He drew 
out a folder. “I have here,” he said, 
“your tax reports for the past three 
years. They all show a loss, and 
are therefore evidence that you are 
not competent.” 



Prologue to Freedom 



37 




Sam said, “Oh!” 

It wasn’t that he had forgotten. 
But actually the competence he 
had developed in simultaneously 
making a large profit but never 
paying income tax, had become 
such an automatic skill that for a 
decade he had taken it for granted 
as a way of life. 

At once, there was no point in 
protesting. But he did say bitterly, 
“You look like one of those college 
students who came around before 
the election to tell me how great 
everything would be for me.” 

Off to one side, the oldest of the 
three men cleared his throat. And, 
speaking English with a thick, 
foreign accent, said, “He is college 
student, yes. But is also dedicated 
government agent for the people.” 
Sam gazed grimly into the 
speaker’s brown eyes. “I heard 
about your kind,” he said grimly. 
“One of those experts invited over 
from U.S.S.R. to tell kids like this 
what to do.” 

His thumb indicated the “kid.” 
He grew aware that the Russian 
was pointing with his thumb at the 
third man. “Mr. Thompson regis- 
tered college student,” he said. “Big 
job to do. Will take over, manage 
your store with competence. Put 
everything behind glass cases. All 
profits to the people.” 

The new “owner” of Mebley’s 
Grocery Store walked to the end 
of the counter, and behind it. As 
he came back up to Sam, he said, 
“Show me where everything is, Mr. 
Mebley. I hope you’ll be willing to 
give me a hand during the first 
couple of days.” 



They were all three looking at 
him. And it seemed to Sam that he 
got the thought right now. Quickly, 
he spoke the magic words, “Sure, 
sure. For the people.” 

“Law is reason or intelligence 
unperturbed, and free from the 
influence of anger, cupidity, 
hate, or prejudice; nor is it de- 
flected by tears or threats. Man, 
on the other hand, however well 
endowed with reason, is seized 
and overcome by wrath, ven- 
geance and other passions. ” 
Vindiciae Contra Tyrannous, 

1 6 th century. 

Did a faint tendril of doubt ever 
move through Paul Vakor’s mind? 
Was there a moment when he won- 
dered if, perhaps, there was, in fact, 
any proof that Leninism-Marxism 
was the ultimate political solution 
for all problems? 

The reality wasn’t quite like that. 
Paul’s personal struggle was with 
what he silently described to him- 
self as the remaining attributes of 
his capitalist upbringing; ambition. 
Naturally, he had to conceal that 
he had any. And he tried to do 
things that would make him look 
selfless while he maneuvered for 
power. 

The colossal success of Propos- 
ition 8, determinedly expected but 
not actually anticipated, required 
hundreds of individuals to fight for 
leadership positions. Yet each indi- 
vidual had to pretend he was no 
better than the lowliest worker — 
except for his dedication, of 
course. 

That became the decisive 



38 



IF 




thought . We were up front dur- 
ing the struggle days — People who 
jumped aboard the bandwagon 
after the victory, no matter how 
well educated, could not be trusted 
in this beginning period to carry 
through. 

So here was Paul, one of hun- 
dreds of dedicated students, per- 
sonally heading a takeover team. 
Feeling right about it. Convinced 
that human misbehavior derived 
only from Capitalism. 

The first intimation that all 
might not be well with him had 
come a week earlier when he read 
a jubilant announcement, printed 
in identical words in both news- 
papers. It stated that members of 
the American Communist Party 
had been invited by the govern- 
ment of California — the new name 
of the northern economic area — to 
come to San Francisco. Their help, 
and their intimate knowledge of 
Marxism, apparently, would make 
certain that everything was done 
right. 

As the days went by, the papers 
and TV reported an enthusiastic re- 
sponse to the invitation. Eveiy day, 
some 30,000 individuals were 
crossing the border from the other 
50-odd states of the union. 

It seemed that they could enter 
merely by showing their ACP mem- 
bership card. The same card was 
all they needed to check in at the 
best hotels, and to obtain entrance 
to that sancrosanct of inner 
sanctums where, on the day after 
the election, the top promoters of 
8 had set up the self-appointed gov- 
ernment of Economic Area One, 



and started issuing orders “for the 
people.” 

Exactly one week after that flow 
of holders of the card began arriv- 
ing, Paul Vakor returned from his 
Sam Mebley takeover and found 
waiting for him an order to go at 
once to Work Apportionment. 

“ . Why don’t you,” said the 
young woman at the desk in what 
had been the headquarters of Bank 
of America, “report to the commis- 
sar in charge of Central Area Col- 
lective Farm number twenty-three, 
which is the process of organiza- 
tion, and needs dedicated help.” 
She reached to one side of her 
desk, which was piled with pam- 
phlets, took one, and held it out to 
him. 

“Here’s a map on how to get 
there.” 

“B-but,” protested Paul, “I’m a 
fourth year college student.” He 
struggled inwardly to find the right 
words. “I can be more useful on 
a — ” He had been about to say 
“higher level,” and stopped just in 
time; finished lamely — “a job re- 
quiring training and education.” 
‘That will come in time,” said 
the woman. “At the moment we 
need farm workers.” 

A suspicion had been struggling 
inside Paul. So at this penultimate 
moment, when all was lost, he was 
able to gulp it out: “Uh, who recom- 
mended me for this?” 

The woman looked down at her 
paper. “It’s signed Tim Frantor,” 
she said. 

“Uh,” stuttered Paul, “Uh— ” 

But she was motioning to the 
man at the head of the line ten feet

away. “Next,” she called out. 

“In all well-attempered govern- 
ments there is nothing which 
should be more jealously main- 
tained than the spirit of obedi- 
ence to law, more especially in 
small matters; for transgres- 
sion creeps in unperceived and 
at last ruins the state. ” 

Aristotle, 364-322 B. C. 

There comes an occasional mo- 
ment in the life of a 22 year-old 
when a reluctant memory of par- 
ents surfaces without being in- 
stantly shoved back out of sight. 
Usually, when this rare event oc- 
curs, it has to do with a need for 
money. 

Such a moment — and such a 
need — came for Paul Vakor as he 
emerged from his interview onto 
the late afternoon street. And so, 
after stumbling along for a while, 
he went into a phone booth, put in 
his two quarters, and made a col- 
lect call to the Second Economic 
Area. 

At this early moment, no one had 
got around to “rationalizing” — a 
word that was being used more 
and more — the telephone system. 
And so there, presently, was his 
father’s voice saying, “Who?” And 
then, when the computer supplied 
the name of the caller a second 
time, the familiar voice said grimly, 
“Tell that S.O.B. to go to hell. Al- 
though I paid for his way through 
college, hoping for the best, I 
haven’t had a son since he got 
mixed up with the radical left in 
his sophomore year.” 

And with those words com- 

40 IF 



pleted, bang! — down went the re- 
ceiver. 

The tinkle of his quarters being 
returned somehow reminded Paul 
that he had been so zealous all day 
in pursuit of his studies that he had 
not talked to Anasia. Or rather, 
when he’d phoned in the morning, 
there was no reply. And what with 
his numerous takeover actions of 
the day, he had not tried a second 
time. 

He put the quarters back in, and 
tried again. After the phone had 
rung half a dozen times he was con- 
vinced. By then he had had another 
thought; and he recognized it im- 
mediately as his inspiration of the 
day. Instantly, came the feeling: 
saved! — 

. Sam Mebley had waited until 
after dark. Not too early, not too 
late; so it seemed to him. A mid- 
night prowler might be reported. 
But ten o’clock was surely a neu- 
tral hour. 

After a careful survey, he step- 
ped into the alleyway, and walked 
to the rear of what, until mid-after- 
noon, had been his grocery store. 
In the dark it took a little longer 
to lift away the camouflage from 
his hiding place — and to replace it 
after he removed the money he had 
hidden there — his hourly accru- 
als — during the day. 

The amount was not large: 
slightly less than $1,000. But worth 
a short trip. That was not a matter 
that Sam argued with himself; his 
acceptance of what had to be done 
was automatic. 

The biggest shock, then, was 
when all the rear-of-the-store lights 




went on. They were flood bright, 
he’d had them that way for occa- 
sions when deliveries arrived after 
dark. 

Sam did not try to run. After that 
first, stunned moment, he merely 
stood resigned, as the young col- 
lege student who had headed the 
afternoon takeover, emerged from 
the back door, followed by 
Thompson, the new storekeeper. 

It was the student who searched 
Sam, found the cash, and placed it 
in his executive case. As he closed 
the bag, Paul said to Sam in a sav- 
age tone, “We will be filing charges 
against you. But now, get!” 

Sam got. 

After the ex-owner had de- 
parted, Paul turned to the blond 
Thompson, “Thanks for coming to 
assist in this matter. But now. I’ll 
take this to headquarters, and 
you’d better go home 2 md get some 
sleep.” 

Both men went through the 
store. And then, after Thompson 
had locked up, went their separate 
ways in two different cars. Paul 
still had the official black machine 
with the lettering painted on the 
side. Fortunately, he was able to 
return it before midnight to the car 
pool of the Department of Transi- 
tional Actions. Which meant that 
no one would ask questions as to 
its whereabouts. And he still had 
a key to his office in the depart- 
ment itself. So he sat there, and 
spoke into the computer, stating 
charges against Sam Mebley some- 
what different than he had 
threatened. His accusation was 
that Sam had filed false income 



statements, and should be investi- 
gated by his successor. Hastily, he 
signed the computer printout, 
folded it into an envelope, and 
tossed it into the Work Load chute. 

And so he had $903. And the be- 
lief that it would be a long time 
before anyone discovered what 
had happened. 

. Those S.O.B.S, he thought 
grimly, giving me a daily allow- 
ance; so I’d always be broke, and 
have to come back and do their 
dirty work. He who had been as 
dedicated as the next man, was 
being treated like a nobody who 
had to take any job they wanted 
to give. Well, they could all go they 
knew where! 

It was after he counted the 
money that he phoned Anasia 
again. When — again — ^there was no 
answer, the first worry came. He 
had been intent all day, doing his 
job. Truth was, Anasia was an inde- 
pendent type, who didn’t believe 
in telling her boy friend everything 
she did. So he had been merely 
puzzled. Until now. 

He spent the night in one of the 
big hotels — as a precaution — and 
phoned occasionally. But in the 
morning, after eating a hasty 
breakfast, he took a taxi over to 
her apartment. 

“For we have full experience of 
the truth of Solon's saying, that 
all public matters depend on re- 
ward and punishment; that 
where these are wanting, the 
whole discipline of state totters 
and falls to pieces. ” 

John Calvin, 1509-1564 

There are people who never 

Prologue to Freedom 41 




forget a sharp remark against 
them. During the heat of the cam- 
paign for Proposition 8, Paul had 
spoken sharply to seven fellow stu- 
dents and to three professors. 

That last had the most im- 
mediate effect. He was failed in 
three subjects, and was accord- 
ingly not allowed to graduate. 

Tim FYantor was one of the 
seven students. In the heat of a 
meeting on tactics, Paul had called 
Tim an idiot. The words were: 
“You’re Just another nut, Tim. An 
idiot, if you think anything like that 
will work.” 

. Paul let himself in to Anasia’s 
apartment with his key. After 
checking the place, not sure Just 
what he should look for, he settled 
down in front of the TV. And 
waited. The day went by slowly; 
but watching TV did have some in- 
teresting highpoints: the changes 
that had been made. The soap 
operas were still there; but they 
were dramatically changed; and 
words like Comrade, and terms 
like duty to the people, abounded. 
(His impression was that the writ- 
ers didn’t quite know how it should 
be; but they were trying.) 

During the evening, the phone — 
that had been silent all day — rang 
three times. Each time it was a 
feminine voice. And each time — it 
turned out — the owner of the voice 
had not been in touch with Anasia 
for a week or more. 

That reminded Paul. His 
sweetheart’s best friend was Bella 
Arne. Bella was in the phone book. 
And there, after four rings, was 
Bella’s voice, saying, “Oh, Paul, I’ve 



been trying to phone you since two 
nights ago. But there was no reply 
at your place. Anasia tried to call 
you before she left.” 

“Left to where?” 

“She phoned me from her bed- 
room. An “8” team came to her 
place, and said they had orders to 
send her to Satellite CA.” 

Paul said, “Oh!” with a sinking 
feeling. 

Satellite CA. was the space fac- 
tory complex assigned to the orig- 
inal California — now divided into 
two economic sections like the 
land far below. 

“B-but,” Paul protested, “how 
can you order somebody to? — ” He 
stopped. Gulped. And asked, “Did 
she say who gave the order?” 
“Somebody called Tim Frantor.” 
“Oh!” said Paul. Then, mumbling, 
“Thank you, Bella. I’ll see if I can 
get in touch with her.” 

He hung up. And sat there. 

The following morning he 
phoned Tim Frantor’s office. And 
then again later; and every day two 
or three times. Every day, he was 
told by a woman’s voice either that, 
“Mr. Frantor is in conference.” “Mr. 
Frantor is on another line. Can I 
have him call you?” Or, “Mr. Fran- 
tor is not at lus desk.” Or, finally, 
“Mr. Frantor has left the office for 
the day.” 

But on the fifth day Frantor 
came to the phone. His voice had 
an urgent note in it: “Paul, I need 
your help. I was ordered confined 
to my office here this morning, and 
I haven’t been able to make any 
calls out through the switchboard. 
Now listen, I’m on the second floor.

IF 




So if you’ll come over with one of 
those extension ladders — ” Has- 
tily, he described the location of 
his office; ended as hastily, “Don’t 
let me down, Paul I’ll make it up 
to you.” 

“Wait!” yelled Paul, “don’t hang 
up.” When it was clear that the line 
was still open, Paul went on, “Be- 
fore you leave your office, put 
through an order assigning Anasia 
back to San Francisco.” He added 
desperately, “If you put that 
through channels, nobody will 
notice; you know by now how 
those things work.” 

“Oh, sure, sure,” came the reply. 
“And also it’ll show that I’m still 
on the job. See you. Be quick, for 
God’s sake.” 

“ I do want to get rich but I 

never want to do what there is 

to do to get rich. ” 

Gertrude Stein, 1874-1946 

No one gave Paul Vakor more 
than a passing glance or two, as 
he put up the ladder. 

He had rented it and the truck 
for $83 cash, plus $100 deposit, 
also cash. The deposit was to be 
refunded when he returned the 
equipment. 

So, now, he maneuvered the re- 
latively long, aluminum ladder 
against the lower window sill; and 
he had a pail of water standing by, 
and cloths, and a can of glass clean- 
ing spray. It was part of his pre- 
tense that he was a workman doing 
a routine Job. 

Frantor must have been waiting 
with a desperate impatience. Be- 
cause, as the top of the ladder hit 



the sill, the window of that ancient 
building squeaked open. And, 
rapidly, a fi'antic, trousered leg 
poked out. It was swiftly followed 
by a second trousered leg, and the 
rear of the whole trousers. 

What held up the rescue opera- 
tion briefly, then, was that the part 
of Frantor that was still inside 
seemed to be busy. After nearly 
twenty seconds, however, the head 
and shoulders slid out, and one 
arm and hand emerged holding a 
large wastepaper basket, while the 
other hand reached down and 
grasped the top rung. 

Like Paul’s, his was a medium 
long body that, also, had the 
strength of a twenty-two year-old. 
And so, down he half slid, man- 
ipulating his basket, which, on 
reaching the sidewalk, he placed 
in the truck cab. 

The two young ex-commissars 
teamed to unextend the extension 
ladder back to its short form. They 
did not, at this time, attempt to fit 
it into its cradle in the back of the 
truck; simply tossed it in. And de- 
parted; the truck, with Paul driving, 
swerved into the traffic, and then 
zipped around the first corner. 

As they zoomed along, Paul 
watched the street, and was care- 
ful not to glance at his hard-breath- 
ing rider. There would have to be 
a few confrontations; but that was 
for later. 

As the breathing slowed toward 
normal, Frantor spoke for the first 
time: “Don’t worry, Paul. I’ll make 
it up to you, what I had to do.” 

It was a good opening line. And 
it augured well for Paul’s special 



Prologue to Freedom 



43 




scheme for their future. Presuma- 
bly, he would have a willing col- 
laborator. 

Once more, the long-faced youth 
spoke: “I got two old style automa- 
tic pistols, two S.D. computers, and 
the most expensive small office 
items I could lay my hands on.” 

Neither man had even a momen- 
tary thought of the qualm variety, 
that this was thievery Frantor was 
describing. Paul was nodding; and 
he spoke now for the first time: 
“Best you could do under the cir- 
cumstances.” 

The computers and the automa- 
tics, particularly, could be useful — 
that seemed to be true in the up- 
side down world where they now 
had their being. 

They were approaching the 
truck and ladder rental yard; and 
so Paul said quickly, “I have an idea 
Tm going to have a hard time get- 
ting back my $100 deposit unless 
we play it tough as a team.” 

What they did, they entered the 
small office of the rental company; 
entered it with Frantor right be- 
hind Paul. Then they spoke to each 
other several times to establish 
that they were together. But Fran- 
tor waited at the door while Paul 
presented his duplicate copy. 

The man behind the counter 
glanced at it. And said at once, “I’m 
afraid I’m going to have to have 
that truck checked in our garage 
for damages. And so you come 
back tomor — ” 

It was at that point that his eyes 
must have caught the movement 
of Frantor taking the automatic out 
of his pocket and slipping it into 

44 IF 



an exposed position at the top 
front of his trousers. 

Pause; then: “Oh, well,” came the 
words, “we have your address.” 
Whereupon, he counted out the 
$ 100 . 

As soon as they were outside, 
Paul said, “And now, let me tell 
you what I think we should do to 
get some real money.” 
Whereupon, he described the 
Sam Mebley incident. Explained: 
‘The guy that’s running the store 
now — ^Thompson — ^told me he 
took in over $1100 the last half of 
his first afternoon. True, that’s the 
busy time; people going home from 
work do the most shopping. But if 
you add what I got and what he 
got, it comes to over $2000. And 
that’s for one day. My guess: Sam 
has been grossing $60,000 a month 
in that little place. And somehow 
declaring income tax on only half 
of that. So — here’s the point — he’s 
got cash around somewhere; and 
we have to pry some of it away 
from him.” 

And the illegality of that did not 
seem to disturb Frantor either. It 
was almost as if they agreed that, 
during the transitional period, 
money and goods belonged to any- 
one who could grab first. 

“How,” was all Frantor asked, 
“do you think we should work it?” 
“He doesn’t know you,” said 
Paul. “So our job is to keep track 
of him; and you do all the front 
work, and any necessary contacts, 
while I remain out of sight but 
handy. I have a feeling he’s going 
to head south. So we’ll need a car. 
Right now. I’ve got to wait here 




until Anasia is returned from Satel- 
lite CA. And then — ” 

“Oh, she’ll be back tonight,” said 
FVantor. 

“That makes it all simple,” was 
Paul’s relieved reply. 

"... certain rights can never be 
granted to the government, but 
must be kept in the hands of the 
people. ” 

Eleanor Roosevelt, 1884-1962 

Sam and Stella drove down 
Highway 385 — the mountain-de- 
sert route (by way of Lake Tahoe). 
In addition to some funds he had 
in his billfold, Sam had $5,000 hid- 
den in the trunk. His hope was that 
the “commies” during this transi- 
tional stage, hadn’t got around to 
“setting up shop” — as he put it — 
“in hot as Hades Mojave.” 

But there was a bad moment 
when the computerized car re- 
sponded to a radar speed warning, 
and presently rolled to a stop in 
front of a computer eye-o, which 
was embedded in a metal roadside 
communication post. 

On the post, a light blinked. So 
Sam maneuvered the machine by 
hand control until he could reach 
over and pick up the receiver. 

A man’s voice said, “Our elec- 
tronic check shows that this car is 
registered in the name of Sam Meb- 
ley.” 

‘This is he,” replied Sam gloom- 
ily- 

“According to our system report 
your vehicle was traveling at ex- 
cessive speed. The fine is $48. Stop 
at the patrol station automat in 
Palmdale and pay the full amount 



before proceeding.” 

Sam was recovering. “You sure 
these fines are still legal under the 
new system?” he asked. 

There was no verbal reply. Only 
a clicking sound, presumably of 
disconnect. 

But he was actually glad to stop. 
And did, in fact, pay the fine into 
an automat machine; but all the 
time thinking happily: “By God, 
this proves that this is still an open 
route.” 

Which meant that before they 
plugged this loophole he could go 
up every day, and come back — 
every day — until those one 
hundred and eight remaining G’s 
were safe in G-land. 

The rest of the trip was in that 
very same G-land, now called 
Angelona — ^the new name of the 
second economic area. It was after 
they had been (safe?) in what had 
formerly been southern California, 
for at least an hour, that Stella said, 
“How are you going to live, Sam. 
Are you going to ask for public as- 
sistance?” 

The plump-faced man was too 
flabbergasted by the question to 
answer immediately. Long ago, he 
had made the decision never to teU 
a woman his true financial situa- 
tion. His observation: women got 
awfully big ideas awfully quick. So 
the chunky little woman knew no- 
thing of his savings. 

What staggered him about her 
suggestion was that it might be a 
handy concealment for his situa- 
tion. At the moment he merely said, 
“I got a few hundred bucks. That’ll 
give us a chance to look around,

and see what’s what. May be some 
changes down here, also. 

What he had found on each of 
his previous visits was that Los 
Angeles was swarming with re- 
fugees; and according to the pa- 
pers hotel rooms were hard to get. 

As it turned out, there had been 
an odd, partial solution to that 
problem. 

Essentially, concern for people 
who asked for, or needed welfare, 
devolved upon a small percentage 
of the populance. There were re- 
ligious workers who dealt with the 
poor and the sick, and there were 
the town, city, or government offi- 
cials who were constantly con- 
fronted by the problem of what to 
do with an individual, or a family, 
without income of any kind. 

The rest of the people would 
rather not see, or have any direct 
contact with the problem. Or, if 
they took note, they had a negative 
reaction. 

It was an organized body of this 
latter group in Angelona who saw 
the condition of California as an 
opportunity. More important, indi- 
viduals among them were suffi- 
ciently educated so that they knew 
what had happened in Russia in 
1917 and in China in ’48. This group 
spread the word where it would 
do the most good, from their point 
of view. 

How quickly does news travel? 
How soon do people act? 

The reaction started the first 
week. 

The poor districts of Los Angeles 
and San Diego — ^particularly those 
two cities — experienced a remark- 

46 IF 



able upheaval. People began to 
leave. Social workers reported that 
ten, twenty, and even thirty year 
welfare cases simply got up and 
left their rented houses or apart- 
ments. 

Since there are always observers 
and tale-bearers, the story was that 
long lines of old jalopy cars headed 
north over Interstate 5, 101 and 1 
(the coast highway), and even 385 
by way of Mojave — headed by all 
three routes in the general direc- 
tion of San Francisco. After these 
various caravans crossed the “bor- 
der” into Califrania, it wasn’t long 
before a dozen cars would take this 
or that off ramp and, in a manner 
of speaking, were never seen again. 

But there, also, were observers. 
And so reports came of how they 
drove into small and large com- 
munities, to ranches and farm 
houses, and simply moved in and 
took over: homes, farms, busines- 
ses. 

In some places signs appeared. 
They all had the same justified 
thought printed on them: “This 
property taken over for the 
people.” The signs were mostly 
crudely done. Sometimes, they 
were scrawled on white card- 
board. Yet here and there was ac- 
tually carved wood or shaped 
metal nailed onto a solidly dug-in 
post. 

(Some owners were quick. They 
had their own signs up, so that 
when the caravan arrived it looked 
as if that place had already been 
seized “for the people.”) 

But when Ed Clint knocked on 
the door behind one or another of 




these signs, and asked what the 
thought was, one man said, “When 
I heard that this is what the poor 
people did in Russia and China, I 
realized it was up to me to do my 
share, and show where I stood,” 

It turned out that the caravans 
were a little late for Nob Hill and 
other fine residential sections in 
northern Califrania. In those areas, 
members of the American Com- 
munist Party had moved their 
families into all the fancy homes. 

Attempts made to interview this 
level of takeover were mostly re- 
pulsed. But here and there Clint 
elicited a reply. One woman came 
to the door of a 20-room mansion, 
and said, “We are dedicated per- 
sons who have the interest of the 
people at heart. This house was 
formerly occupied by someone 
who had no such concern.” 

Ed Clint pointed out. “The out- 
ward appearance is that another 
elite group has taken over. What 
do you think of the claim of Prop- 
osition 8 promoters that the two 
interacting economic areas will 
solve all these problems of human 
greed and the negative side of 
human nature in general?” 

There was no verbal answer to 
the question. At that point the door 
was slammed in Clint’s face. 

"Genuine government 
Is but the eocpression of a 
nation, good 
Or less good — even as all 
society, 

However unequal, monstrous, 
crazed and cursed 
Is but the eocpression of men's 
single lives. 



The loud sum of the silent 
units. ” 

Sonnets from the Portuguese 

by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 
1806-61 

Stella’s suggestion, and his reac- 
tion, had an important immediate 
effect on Sam: when they arrived 
in Los Angeles he drove straight 
down to one of the well-defined 
welfare areas. 

Everywhere they looked there 
were “to let” signs on small houses. 
Many of the signs also stated: “Fur- 
nished.” 

It was one of these furnished 2- 
bedroom houses that Sam rented 
for one month for $2,000. Inflation, 
that exact measure of the 
phenomenon known as a Seller’s 
Market, had moved into Los 
Angeles, along with two million re- 
fugees from Califrania. 

The following day Sam was still 
inwardly arguing ^ls to what his 
best course of action would be — 
when the phone rang. It was a 
youthful male voice that rep- 
resented itself as being from the 
local office of the Internal Revenue 
Service. The voice gave the ad- 
dress of a hotel, and a room 
number. 

“Come by this afternoon. Ask for 
Mark Armour.” 

“What time?” asked Sam, gloom- 
ily- 

“Two o’clock.” 

“Okay, okay. I’ll be there.” 

“Oh, and by the way — ” 

“Yes?” Resignedly. 

“Don’t be surprised at the ap- 
pearance of confusion. “There’s 



Prologue to Freedom 



47 




hundreds of us down here from the 
northern economic area. And 
we’re all in temporary quarters.” 

As he broke the connection after 
that call, Sam was bitter. “Those 
damn computers!” he complained. 
“If you sign up to live somewhere, 
instantly your name is recorded; 
and, boy! they’ve got you.” 

Stella said nothing. She had been 
strangely quiet since the previous 
day. She had accepted the better 
of the two bedrooms without argu- 
ment. Accepted a visit from him in 
the late evening; and made break- 
fast for him this morning. But now, 
as she sat on the couch beside him, 
Sam grew aware of a strange ex- 
pression on her face. 

The chunky little woman 
seemed to shrink down there be- 
side him on the couch. Her plain 
and wrinkled face acquired a timid 
expression. 

Finally, in a small voice she said, 
“Maybe the time has come for us 
to get married.” She added quickly, 
“I promise always to treat you just 
as good as I do now.” 

Sam did not need her to explain 
what she meant. There was a time 
when Sam had married. During the 
courtship period it had looked like 
he was involved with a sex maniac. 
Twice an evening was nothing. 
Several tunes a week she would 
let herself into his house at 6 A.M. 
and crawl into bed with him. And 
a number of times she showed up 
at his store during her lunch 
hour — she was a secretary in a gov- 
ernment office. (They went into 
the back room.) 

But within a week after the wed- 

48 IF 



ding bells ceased to toll, she de- 
veloped her first not-tonight 
headache. And thereafter it was all 
downhill. 

He ended the marriage after two 
years by simply filing suit for di- 
vorce; and the two attorneys 
worked out the financial settle- 
ment. 

Fortunately, she presently re- 
married. And Sam was off the hook 

“What bothers me,” said Sam 
now, “is, I think there’s supposed 
to be some recompense for ex- 
propriated property. And I should 
get, uh, maybe one-fifty for my 
equity in my place in San Fran- 
cisco. And maybe if that happens 
we can get married.” 

It was the best excuse he could 
manage on short notice. Truth, he 
was not entirely opposed to the 
idea of marrying the little woman. 
Two pre-Stella associations with 
considerably better looking 
females had taught him his final 
lesson: the fancier a woman 
looked, the more expensive she 
was. 

That afternoon, 2 P.M. 

The confusion at the temporary 
office of the Internal Revenue Ser- 
vice wasn’t that great. There were 
boxes, loaded with what looked 
like files and stacks of white paper, 
piled in one corner — Paul and Tim 
had carted the boxes up a back 
stairway of the hotel one at a time. 

The hotel desk in the room they 
had hauled over to the window on 
the other side of the bed. The per- 
son sitting at the desk was a young 
man; and he faced the door. There 
was an extra chair to his right; and 




he motioned Sam toward it 

As he settled into it Sam noticed 
that there were the usual IRS pam- 
phlets spread along one edge; and 
some invoices with Internal Re- 
venue Service printed onto them — 
that had been a hasty Xerox 
achievement. But, in fact, there 
was no problem. Sam had no sus- 
picion as he gazed uneasily at the 
young man who now said, “I’m 
Mark Armour. And you?” 

“Sam Mebley.” 

The lean youth looked down at 
some papers on his desk. Nodded. 
And drew them closer to him. 
While still studying them, he 
explained that the two economic 
areas were transmitting informa- 
tion to each other, as required by 
Proposition Eight. And that, as a 
result — at that point he looked up 
and stared balefully into Sam’s 
eyes. 

“Charges have been filed against 
you,” he said. 

“By whom?” 

“By our San Francisco office.” 

Since that was the correct loca- 
tion, Sam braced himself. “What 
are the charges? 

“That you falsified your income 
tax reports, and that in fact you 
made a considerable hidden profit 
each year of the four years 
examined.” 

It was truth. And, oddly, it felt 
good to have it stated openly. Sam 
said in a relieved voice, “I can see 
that whoever filed the charges is 
not familiar as yet with the prob- 
lems of operating a grocery store 
in a poor neighborhood.” 

“You deny the charges?” 



“Totally.” 

Pause. The young man was 
straightening in his chair. His ex- 
pression was grim, as he said, “It 
turns out, Mr. Mebley, that you’re 
actually very fortunate. Because of 
the special situation created by 
Proposition Eight, we could waste 
a lot of time discovering the exact 
amount of your debt. Accordingly, 
I am authorized to fine you $25,000; 
and that will be all there is against 
you. However — ’’the eyes were 
baleful — “if the fine is not paid 
into this office by tomorrow morn- 
ing you will be subject to Clause 
Eleven of Proposition Eight.” 

There was silence while Sam un- 
happily considered parting with 
$25,000. Yet, in fact, to a practical 
person like himself, it had the look 
of being an easy way out. 

“Let me understand you,” he 
said. “If I can, uh, borrow $25,000. 
from some friends up north, I will 
be given a release from all IRS 
claims against me?” 

“You will receive a proper re- 
lease document,” was the reply. 

“Can I pay it to your office in 
San FYancisco?” Sam asked. “I’ll 
have to fly up tonight, and borrow 
the money.” 

“Let me check on that,” said the 
false Mike Armour, “and I’ll phone 
you.” 

When the phone call came an 
hour later, it developed that Ar- 
mour had been assigned to ride 
herd on the situation. “So,” his 
voice came on the phone, I’ll fly 
up with you, and we’ll settle the 
matter.” 

As Sam explained it to Stella, 

Prologue to Freedom 49 




that was obviously a practical sol- 
ution to the many confusions 
created by Proposition Eight. “I 
guess they figure it’s better for me 
to talk to one guy than keep meet- 
ing new people who don’t know 
what’s gone before.” 

Stella would stay behind and 
hold onto the rented house. 

“Indeed, I thought, slipping the 
silver into my purse, it is re- 
markable, remembering the bit- 
terness of those days, what a 
change of tempera fixed income 
will bring about. ” 

Virginia Woolf, 1882-1941 

After Sam departed the hotel 
room, Paul entered from the bed- 
room. They stood looking at each 
other; and for a long moment Paul 
did not notice that his companion- 
in-crime was not smiling jubilantly 
as he was; and, in fact, he was not 
smiling at all.” 

“What’s the matter?” asked Paul. 
“We may have to kill the old 
S.O.B.,” said Frantor, “after we get 
the money.” 

Paul was astounded. “Whatever 
for?” 

“He may go to the authorities 
and describe us. You, particularly.” 
“He’s not going to see me in this 
situation. And he’ll never see you 
again. This is a one-shot deal. And, 
besides — ” Paul smiled grimly — 
“he has to keep a low profile, so 
no one will suspect how much 
more cash he’s got.” 

“WeU!!!” The other youth 
seemed uncertain. “I’m ready to do 
what has to be done. In this Prop- 
osition Eight shiftover it’s begin- 



ning to look as if it’s every man for 
himself.” 

There was a pause. A silence. 
Paul Vakor stood and Tim Frantor 
remained seated; and they looked 
not exactly at each other but 
slightly off to one side, two young 
instant criminals, with one of 
them — Paul — suddenly remem- 

bering what Frantor had already 
done against him . Every man 
for himself . I’m going to have to 
watch out for this so-and-so. 

At once he was cunning. “Okay, 
Tim, count me. We’ll do what has 
to be done. But I don’t think we 
have to do that.” 

“I guess you’re right,” was the 
quick reply from a young man who 
had suddenly had his own private 
thought, that the less he confided 
in anyone, the better. 

“Step one,” said Paul, “we get the 
money. Step two, then we decide 
what to do next — ” 

The money, they got. That was 
no problem. Sam had made his 
peace with the payment of 25 
thousand in full in return for an 
IRS receipt, a xerox version, which 
Tim signed with the name Mike Ar- 
mour. By the time he arrived back 
in Los Angeles, with 12 thousand 
more of his hidden funds, Sam was 
feeling quite cheerful. And wonder- 
ing what his next move should be 
in the game of life under Proposi- 
tion 8. 

Stella had some puzzling news 
for him. ‘The I.R.S. called,” she 
said. “They want you to come and 
see them. Here’s the number to 
caU.” 

It was a different number and a 



50 



IF 




different name. And, when he got 
there it was actually inside a build- 
ing devoted entirely to government 
business. No piled boxes. No hotel 
room confusion. Everything was in 
order. Neat desks, private rooms; 
and in one of the latter a big, well- 
dressed man in his thirties whose 
name was Warren Tate. 

It took a while. Sam explained. 
Sam showed his receipt. Twice, 
Warren Tate went out, and twice 
came back, presumably after con- 
sulting with someone else. In fact, 
the second time he returned with 
a middle-aged woman, who also 
listened to Sam’s story. 

And, evidently, there had been 
other persons contacted; for a 
young man came in, and said, “The 
hotel reports that the room was 
occupied by a young man named 
Mike Armour.” 

The woman asked, “Did they ver- 
ify his name?” 

“Well — ” a pause — “it seems 
that a newly hired night clerk let 
him in. Maybe a bribe — ” 

(A bribe it had been: a $200 di- 
rect payment, not counting the 
room rent for two days and two 
nights.) 

(No one suspected Paul Vakor. 
His action in originally filing the 
charges somehow proved him to 
be unconnected with what fol- 
lowed.) 

After about ten minutes, the 
woman came over to Sam, and 
said, “Proposition Eight has 
created many confusions that, ap- 
parently, cannot be easily resol- 
ved.” 



They let him go. 

Later, when Ed Clint got onto 
the story, he found Sam and Stella 
in their rented house, waiting — as 
the TV reporter described the situ- 
ation to the vast audience in the 
eastern United States — for the gov- 
ernment of Califrania to reimburse 
Sam for his expropriated house in 
South San FYancisco, so that he 
and his lady could get married. 

Clint added, “This is just one lit- 
tle event of many that I have ob- 
served in bits and pieces as they 
developed.” 

The reporter, to whom millions 
listened every night for an update 
on the west coast situation, con- 
cluded: 

“It would appear that, although 
Proposition Eight has not yet pro- 
duced the morality claimed for it 
by its proponents, there is a rough 
justice beginning to show through. 
Sam Mebley was persuaded by 
some inner reaction to the new 
conditions to pay his back taxes 
without an argument. This was a 
result that was achieved only when 
the state took over his small enter- 
prise. And, equally important, 
those who stole the money from 
him will gain thereby only a brief 
postponement of their personal 
rendezvous with destiny, prices 
out here being what they are.” 

As Chnt later observed to his 
own lady friend, a news media per- 
son who expected to operate in 
both Angelona and Califrania, had 
better learn to notice every favor- 
able aspect because there were so 
many unfavorable ones.

R’hyledd drifted in the breeze, 
fully unfolded and nearly transpa- 
rent. While skimming above the 
cloud fields, dropping down occa- 
sionally to absorb a choicer fleck 
of moisture-coated dust, he 



watched the roiling top of a fresh 
bulge of greenish cloud as it poked 
its way ominously through the 
opaque gray haze below. Such an 
upwelhng could mean danger, 
storms brewing in the lower levels. 





And sometimes darters hid in such 
places, their denser bodies less 
likely to be damaged by the turbu- 
lence. A darter could be a threat, 
even to a full grown adult like 
R’hyledd. 

Thinking with resigned irony 
that the best grazing always 
seemed to be in the most danger- 
ous spots, R’hyledd settled down 
on the ridge of atmospheric den- 
sity defining the top of the misty 
blue-gray cloud pasture. 

Trying to judge how much flex- 
ibility remained in his aging body, 
he stretched. Yes, with a little more 
moisture to act as ballast, it might 
be possible to swoop down again, 



joyously cleaving to the rich at- 
mosphere of the lower clouds to 
return coated with nutritious parti- 
cles of all kinds. The youngsters 
would flock around then, anxious 
to partake of the harvest brought 
up by their elder. Their approval 
would be warm and pleasant to 
feel, and their bodies, fragile al- 
most to the point of invisibihty, 
would sparkle brightly against his 
as they fed. 

For just a little longer, R’hyledd 
might be able to believe there was 
still something to look forward to 
in life. 

Foolish, foolish, he thought. At- 
tempt to dive again, and you may

well have no more life to look for- 
ward to. Do not invite your death 
before its time. A long ripple of 
resignation fluttered throu^ his 
outstretchedd drifting veils. Wiser 
by far to dismiss aU thoughts of 
diving again. Oh, yes, far wiser. 

Better to cling to what remained 
of life. Let some other adult feed 
the young. The segments he had 
ruptured in his last dive had only 
now healed and begun to function 
properly. He chided himself yet 
again for having taken such a 
chance. 

Keeping at a safe distance from 
the bulging green cloudtop, 
R’hyledd fed swiftly, not so much 
hungry as thirsty for the moisture 
condensed around the individual 
solid particles. The blue-gray cloud 
field stretched endlessly around 
him in all directions, here and there 
rising in contorted configurations 
that slowly changed their shape as 
pressures and densities shifted in 
the turbulent atmosphere. 

It was the world R’hyledd had 
known all his life, ever changing 
and yet ever the same. Dimly he 
remembered how exciting it had 
seemed, with new possibilities to 
be found in each cloud, new tastes 
and textures. He tried to recapture 
the sense of freshness and beauty 
he had felt so long ago, his first 
impressions as a truly self-con- 
scious adult after combination, 
just emerging from the group con- 
sciousness of the young-flock. So 
marveUous had it been then. 

A tiny tremor ran through his ex- 
tended veils. Life no longer seemed 
so new, and yet it was precious 



still. 

R’hyledd let himself drift closer 
to the greenish cloud. Grazing was 
good here. He swooped through 
the sweet-tasting mists, keeping 
several eyes trained on the 
threatening cloud as he fed. When 
he finally noticed the sparkles of 
a young-flock in the distance, he 
knew it was too late to avoid them. 
Well, let them come. He would re- 
fuse to hear their pleas. He had his 
own life to consider. 

Feeding voraciously on the thin 
dust, the young-flock flitted 
quickly, jerkily, amongst the blue- 
gray clouds. They were hungry, 
very hungry, their fragile bodies 
thin and brittle with near starva- 
tion. They were conscious of no- 
thing save their frantic search for 
food, their sense of group desper- 
ation. They had found no adult to 
feed them for a long time. 

They saw R’hyledd, and knew 
fresh hope. They had not enough 
of awareness to realize he was old; 
they merely knew he was an adult. 
He could dive, and bring them the 
food they needed. No other consid- 
eration mattered to the group 
mind. 

Sparkling with anticipation, they 
flittered after him. 

Inside the swirling turbulence of 
the green upwelling, the darter 
waited, its body drawn together to 
protect itself from the currents, 
watching, gloating. Its prey was al- 
most near enough to attack, but 
the adult was too close. The adult 
might lure them away. It would 



54 



IF 




wait. Perhaps the adult would 
move off, and the young drifters 
would come nearer. 

Resigned to an encounter he 
would have preferred to avoid, 
R’hyledd went to intercept the 
young-flock, preparing to herd 
them away from the danger of the 
spreading green cloud. They were 
young; they wouldn’t have the 
sense to keep at a safe distance. It 
was his duty to protect them. They 
were fragile and beautiful with the 
promise of life. He felt himself ex- 
pand in instinctive response, ach- 
ing to be able to feed them and 
feel their warm glow on his failing 
body. But it would be dangerous 
to yield to that temptation. He 
would lead them away from possi- 
ble danger, that was all. They’d 
have to find another adult to feed 
them. Hadn’t he already decided 
that? 

The young-flock saw him com- 
ing, but they ignored his warning 
flutters. Not comprehending their 
danger, they clustered around his 
huge body, begging, entreating, 
their need for food clearly to be 
felt. 

R’hyledd knew he should get 
them to move farther from the 
greenish cloud, but they felt so 
good rubbing against him, so warm 
and full of life. Their anticipation 
ached through every fiber of his 
diaphanous body. His drifting veils 
quivered with sorrow, because he 
knew he dared not attempt to feed 
them. 



Enough. He only prolonged the 
inevitable frustration and rejection 
by allowing them near. 

He shook himself, whipping the 
clustered multitude of young away 
from his veils, warding them off 
with cautious flicks as they sought 
to come to him again. 

Find another. I cannot help you. 

But the young-flock ignored his 
silent plea. Their rudimentary in- 
telligence unable to comprehend 
even the concept of individual 
being, they sought to impress upon 
R’hyledd their corporate need. 

Through the shifting curtains of 
greenish mist, the darter watched, 
growing impatient at the delay. 

R’hyledd looked at the young- 
flock fluttering persistently around 
him. This flock held promise. It 
was large and bright. He hated to 
abandon it to possible starvation. 
The youngsters seemed almost 
bright enough to combine with 
another young-flock soon. If they 
were properly fed. 

What kind of an adult would he 
be, if he abandoned such a promis- 
ing flock? The last flock he had 
produced would be about that age 
now, although he was sure this 
wasn’t it. Young-flocks always 
showed a distinct aversion to con- 
tact with the adult that had 
spawned them. These had greeted 
him eagerly. 

Frustrated, R’hyledd gathered 
himself tentatively inward, shor- 
tening and folding his veils as he 
assessed his physical condition. 



Cloudscape 



55 




His sac held almost enough mois- 
ture. He could dive, but it would 
be tricky. His body might be old, 
but it would stand the strain, if he 
wanted it to. Just this one last time. 

What was life worth, without 
those few sharp-edged moments of 
impossible joy? What else gave 
meaning to the endless grazing and 
drifting? Most of an adult’s life 
consisted of waiting, preparing, 
gathering moisture. Without the 
sublime satisfaction to be derived 
from feeding the young, he might 
as well be a particle of dust, tumbl- 
ing aimlessly like the cloud parti- 
cles on which he fed. 

He almost had second thoughts, 
but then he glanced once more at 
the sparkling young-flock. Their 
brilliant anticipation simply hurt 
too much. He couldn’t bear to dis- 
appoint them. He had to try. 

He would try. 

R’hyledd continued to fold his 
veils, slowly, carefully, lest he tear 
something. In youth, it had been a 
quick and easy process. Now, there 
was need for caution. 

As he drew in the extended veils, 
he began to sink. The gray-blue 
mists of the cloud pasture closed 
around him, blocking the young- 
sters from his sight. They couldn’t 
dive. They were much too fragile 
to withstand the pressures down 
below. 

R’hyledd couldn’t see, but he 
could feel the growing increase in 
pressure as he fell lower. He sam- 
pled the particles surrounding him. 
Tasty, but nothing special. He 
would go lower still. Since this 
might be his last dive, let it be an 



exceptional one. 

He tilted the edges of his con- 
tracted veils, driving himself 
deeper into the atmosphere. Blue 
faded gradually into green, and he 
even thought he could make out a 
hint of yellow not far below. Yel- 
low was especially good. Thick, 
nutritious particles permeated the 
low yellow clouds. If he could 
reach the yellow, he could unfold 
and collect those particles. They 
would adhere to him easily. 

But he mustn’t get overanxious. 
The pressure had increased con- 
siderably. He felt it pressing in on 
the hollow, air-filled segments of 
his body. He was stiff and inflexi- 
ble with age. It wouldn’t take much 
to crush those segments. With too 
many destroyed, he would never 
rise again. 

The terror of an endless fall into 
heat and intolerable pressure was 
almost enough to make R’hyledd 
seek an updraft immediately. What 
was he doing down this far any- 
way? He was an old fool. Unfold 
now, gather what you can, and re- 
turn to safety, he told himself. 

But the yellow tempted him 
lower, rich, delicious, ^ways fa- 
vored by the young. A bit further. 
Just a bit further. It wasn’t as if 
he’d never gone this deep before. 
Hadn’t he even touched red once? 
He trembled with the thrill of that 
memory. It had been hot and terri- 
ble and marvellous, but he had re- 
turned, the outer edges of his veils 
scorched and seared, two seg- 
ments crushed hopelessly. Two 
separate young-flocks had come to 
him to feed, a rare happening. 



56 



IF 




Many combinations had taken 
place. 

You were young then. Flexible 
and strong. You had only just 
combined. You cannot do today 
what you did then. The truly wise 
know their limits. 

An upwelling of yellow engulfed 
him. He tasted. Oh, yes, this would 
be fine. 

R’hyledd unfolded cautiously, 
buffeted by the fierce gale. He jet- 
tisoned some of the moisture he 
carried, becoming lighter as a re- 
sult. 

The yellow cloud swirled up- 
ward and R’hyledd rode it happily, 
feeling the juicy particles clinging 
to his outspread veils, sticking to 
his main body segments. He ate a 
little himself, but he wasn’t very 
hungry. The youngsters would be 
hungry. Youngsters were always 
hungry. 

The upwelling began to dissipate 
as its heavier particles sank back 
down toward their more normal 
levels. R’hyledd released more of 
his remaining moisture, rising 
above the turbulence. He unfolded 
to his fullest extent in an effort to 
gain altitude. A downdraft caught 
him, swirling him suddenly deeper. 
He fought to get clear of it. 

A small segment ruptured, un- 
able to tolerate the rapid pressure 
change. No matter, he could live 
without it. He had lived through 
minor ruptures before. Only if he 
couldn’t get free of the current 
would he be in real danger of being 
crushed. He fought the buffeting 
winds, but his reactions were slow, 
his body ponderous and weary, 



lacking the responsiveness of 
youth. 

The young-flock danced happily 
along the top of the cloud pasture. 
The adult had gone below. Soon 
they would eat. They skimmed and 
sparkled in short, jerky flights, 
drifting slowly towards the yellow- 
green cloudtop as they tasted the 
richer particles scattered around 
it. 

The darter unfolded its stubby 
segments, preparing to swoop. 

Tenaciously angling his veils 
against the fierce current, R’hyledd 
worked his way to the side, slip- 
ping out of the threatening down- 
draft and once again making his 
way upwards. He had certainly lost 
some of his precious coating of 
particles in the struggle, but that 
couldn’t be helped. He would still 
have enough. 

The mists shifted to greens, then 
blues. Soon he would come out on 
top of the cloud pasture. The 
young-flock would see him, and 
welcome him. He was not too old, 
after all. He had succeeded. His 
ruptured segment ached sharply, 
but it would heal. 

Brimming with anticipation, 
R’hyledd sailed triumphantly out 
of the blue-gray mist, seeking for 
the flock in expectation of immi- 
nent ecstasy. 

They would eat of the rich har- 
vest he had brought them. They 
would sparkle with joy and 
warmth as they gathered around 
him. Perhaps they would awaken 
a spark of life inside his old body, 



Cloudscape 



57 




and he might even prepare to 
spawn again. There were so many 
possibilities now. They — 

They had not heeded his warn- 
ing! They had moved closer to the 
dangerous yellow-green cloudtop! 
A darter flew among them, devour- 
ing them as effortlessly as they de- 
voured dust particles, its hideous 
maw opened wide. 

The youngsters stayed together, 
as any young-flock must, easy prey 
for the creature that fed upon 
them. They could not scatter, since 
they weren’t even aware they were 
all separate entities. In mindless 
panic and shock, they flittered here 
and there, but not fast enough to 
escape the darter’s swooping 
flight. 

R’hyledd’s veils sagged in bitter 
despair. The flock he had meant to 
feed, destroyed, dying. 

As he watched in limp horror, 
another youngster disappeared 
into the darter’s maw, fluttering 
helplessly. And he could do no- 
thing to stop it. 

Nothing‘S R’hyledd thought, 
catching sight of one of his yellow- 
encrusted veils. Darters seldom ac- 
tually fed on adults if there were 
youngsters nearby. They didn’t 
seem to like the adults’ tougher 
skins. However, they had been 
known to pursue an adult carrying 
a harvest. Perhaps he could tempt 
this one, lure it away from the 
flock? 

R’hyledd drifted, quivering with 
indecision. A darter could be 
dangerous. If it closed its jaws on 



one of his veils, it could tear him 
to pieces, ripping the tenuous veils 
beyond repair, sending him plum- 
metting into the depths with no 
way to check that fatal plunge. He 
had no wish to die. He would go 
in search of another flock to feed. 
There were others, after all. They 
had not care for his safety when 
they had urged him to dive. Leave 
them to their fate. 

R’hyledd began a slow turn, his 
body heavy under the thick food 
particles. He turned his eyes away 
from the remnants of the young- 
flock, trying to turn his thoughts 
away also. The youngsters should 
have obeyed him and stayed away 
from the upwelling cloudtop. They 
should not have expected him to 
dive. It was their own fault. 

But R’hyledd couldn’t quite 
bring himself to believe that. After 
all, it was the nature of the young 
to be thoughtless. No one could 
expect a youngster to be other- 
wise, not until after it combined 
with a member of another flock to 
become an adult. Then it would 
begin to think and reason, but cer- 
tainly not before. Prior to that, it 
wasn’t even a separate individual. 

There would be others. Leave 
these to their fate. 

(And yet, how many other 
healthy young-flocks had been 
seen recently? Surely, there had 
been more when he had been 
younger, hadn’t there? And how 
many adults had he encountered, 
in all of his long life? Not enough. 
Certainly not enough.) 

He couldn’t simply desert them. 

R’hyledd cut sharply down in 



58 



IF 




front of the darter, coming be- 
tween it and the flock. At first it 
ignored him, munching on its latest 
catch as it angled around to make 
another pass over the confused 
youngsters. R’hyledd snapped the 
edge of his longest veil, shaking 
loose a puff of yellow food parti- 
cles just in front of the creature. It 
couldn’t help but notice that. 

The darter whipped itself 
around with the horrible speed 
that made its kind so feared by drif- 
ters like R’hyledd. As it twisted, 
R’hyledd swooped into a graceful 
arc, gaining altitude, luring the 
beast higher. He played with it, let- 
ting it almost catch him before he 
flew into an updraft. The cloud 
field sank further below them. The 
underside of the white death- 
clouds that formed the upper limit 
of R’hyledd’s world were close 
above him now. He’d never dared 
to float this high before. The pres- 
sure dropped as they climbed, and 
the world grew colder. 

The darter was afraid. It hesi- 
tated, drawing its body together to 
ward off the cold. The youngsters 
flickered far below, still tempting. 
But the adult would be good to eat. 
The adult was moving slower, 
probably tiring. The darter would 
catch it first, and then return to 
graze on the flock. 

R’hyledd slowed down, feigning 
exhaustion. He fluttered one of his 
veils almost within reach of the 
darter’s maw, luring it on. With un- 
expected cunning, the creature 
lurched forward, catching the edge 



of the veil. 

R’hyledd struggled loose, tearing 
off the part of the veil caught in 
the darter’s maw. He should dive, 
plunge down to the cloud pastures, 
bury himself in their mists for 
safety. The darter might not follow 
him into the mist. It would give up 
and go off in search of other prey. 

He looked down, hoping against 
hope that the young-flock would 
have fled by now. His tom veil was 
a raw edge of pain, leaking pre- 
cious moisture from his ripped tis- 
sues. 

The youngsters grazed, obhvi- 
ous to everything except their 
burning hunger, moving closer to 
the subsiding green upwelling. All 
thoughts of danger had been for- 
gotten. Occasionally, they would 
turn their eyes upwards, wishing 
for the food-laden adult to return 
to them. 

Ah, to be young again, and 
not to know — R’hyledd thought, 
watching them from the freezing 
heights. He returned his thoughts 
to the present problem. If he dove 
for safety, the darter would go after 
the young-flock. He watched the 
creature chewing, the torn edges 
of his ripped veil gradually being 
drawn into its mouth. It swerved 
abruptly up towards him, evidently 
wanting more. 

Higher, then. He would go 
higher. 

With reckless disregard, R’hyledd 
lured the darter into another up- 
draft. They were lifted, tossed al- 
most into the icy fringes trailing 



Cloudscape 



59 




below the death-clouds. R’hyledd 
felt one of his segments rupture 
outwards in the reduced pressure. 

Less able to tolerate pressure 
changes, the darter twitched vio- 
lently, trying to pull itself together 
into a ball, hoping to sink. Its 
mouth opened and closed, belch- 
ing out bits of what it had eaten. 
Its fierce hunger was replaced by 
sudden fear. 

R’hyledd struggled not to look 
at the mess the darter had dis- 
gorged, fragments of his own veil 
mixed with chunks of delicate 
flesh from the devoured young. As 
he tried to fight free of the updraft, 
he felt another of his veils rip in 
the cold wind, sharp agony cleav- 
ing almost into one of his main seg- 
ments. 

The darter couldn’t free itself 
from the updraft. It was tossed 
higher, almost into the white 
clouds overhead. It exploded in a 
sudden burst, ripped segments 
whipped further upwards in the 
wind, torn and shredded. Even as 
R’hyledd watched, the bits of the 
darter’s body began to sink down, 
heavier than the thin atmosphere 
surrounding them. 

I 

The young-flock saw the rain of 
drifting particles begin to descend. 
They flittered joyously, racing to 
be beneath it when it would reach 
their level. They never thought to 
wonder where their unexpected 
bounty had come from. 

The darter was gone. The young- 



flock would be safe. 

But R’hyledd drifted just below 
the high clouds, fluid leaking 
slowly from his ripped veils and 
torn segments. He might be able 
to regain the comfortable regions 
of his familiar cloud pasture, but 
he would surely never dive lower 
again, not after such injuries. He 
would drift awkwardly for the rest 
of his life, crippled and vulnerable. 

Turning his eyes downward, 
R’hyledd surveyed the cloud field 
spread out beneath him. How 
could he have spent all his life 
down there and not realized how 
beautiful it was? Off in the dis- 
tance, he could just make out the 
happy sparkling of yet another 
flock of young. 

The youngsters would no longer 
gather around him. Their gentle 
flashes of gratitude and approval 
would warm his torn and ragged 
body no more, for he could never 
hope to dive again. He had thought 
he’d gotten used to that idea once 
before, but he realized now that he 
would never be able to accept it. 

Descend from these soaring 
heights to that bleak and lonely 
prospect of a useless, shredded 
life? What for? 

No. Better to let it end now, here, 
alone. 

Alone. As an adult was always 
alone, in life or in death. Only the 
young could fool themselves into 
thinking otherwise, caught up in 
their flocks, dazzling against each 
other. And yet, they too were alone 
in the end. When a darter’s cruel 
maw crushed their tender bodies, 
even the young died alone. 



60 



IF 




Was there not, after all, a time 
for dying? And was not this the 
time? Without at least the possibil- 
ity of ecstasy, what was life worth? 

R’hyledd let himself drift higher, 
his depleted mass making it all too 
easy to gain altitude. With sudden 
decision, he jettisoned the last re- 
maining bit of his moisture. He 
couldn’t sink now even if he 
wanted to. 

The raw hunt in his tom seg- 
ments began to fade into numb- 
ness as he floated through trailing 
crystalline fringes of the death- 
cold clouds that had always 
marked the extreme upper bound- 
ary of his world. Far below, the 
ugly greenish eruption in which the 
darter had hidden was barely visi- 
ble. The youngsters he had saved 
were lost from sight, but probably 
still there. They would have forgot- 
ten him by now, with the typical 
short memories of the extremely 
young. No matter; their memories, 
like their shallow and fleeting emo- 
tions, would grow long and deep 
in time. 

In time. In the time he would 
never have, now. But that was as 
it should be. He had done his part. 
He had given them a chance. (For 
the first time, he wondered if some 
other adult had once done as much 
for him, in the time before his pri- 
vate memories began.) 

R’hyledd caught an updraft, let- 
ting it carry him through icy mists 
glowing with an impossible bril- 
liance. He could hardly feel his fro- 
zen body, except for an occasional 
twinge of pain as the more vulner- 
able sections shattered outward in 



the rapidly decreasing pressure 
around him. 

Lifted in the rising column of air, 
he floated at last above the en- 
veloping cloud. For an amazed mo- 
ment, R’hyledd stared down at its 
top, where colors reflected in 
bright rainbows from the cloud’s 
crystalline dust motes. There was 
something else above the top of 
the world, where he had thought 
to find only clouds! Fighting the 
pain that lanced through his body 
as more segments ruptured, he 
turned his eyes upward, straining 
to see. 

Death came, not with the dark- 
ness and crushing pressure he had 
always expected, but in a burst of 
fierce light. 

R’hyledd’s body flew apart in a 
shimmer of frozen particles, each 
one sinking down again toward the 
cloud pastures below, becoming 
drifting motes of organic dust, 
gathering moisture as they fell into 
zones of warming temperatures. 

The flock of youngsters saw the 
rich fall of dust and headed Joy- 
ously towards it. In the distance, 
another flock approached also, 
drawn by the prospect of good 
grazing. Many combinations would

STAYING RICH 

by LARRY NIVEN 



The average citizen of planet Earth is wealthier today than he has 
been throughout human history. From time to time we need to remember 
how much we’ve got to lose. 

After all, you don’t feel rich. 

Do you understand how it can be that more people feel poor today 
than ever before? Here are clues. It isn’t smog, and it isn’t too few 
negative ions in the air. It’s the same effect that robbed the Vietnam 
War of any shadow of glory. It’s one aspect of the rising crime rate. It’s 
the reason everyone seems to be shouting in your ear. It’s the reason 
most of us wouldn’t consider powering our cars with liquid hydrogen. 

It’s communications. Faster and better and more realistic every dec- 
ade. 

Remember the Hindenburg disaster? Giant dirigible that burst into 
flame as it pulled up to a mooring tower. Two-thirds of the passengers 
survived, did you know that? That doesn’t happen when a DC-10 crashes! 
But the Hindenburg disaster was the first such to be reported live on 
radio. The radio audience of the time had no defense against that vision 
of passengers writhing in a storm of flaming hydrogen. Later generations 
have learned not to respond so emotionally, not even when there are 
pictures and gory special effects to increase the impact. 

We have learned, yes. Cast your memory back to Kitty Genovese, 
who was knifed to death in New York over a period of several hours. 
Witnesses watched from scores of windows in surrounding apartment 
buildings. None of them so much as phoned the police. 

And everyone wondered why, but the answer is simple. They had 
been trained not to help . even as you and I have learned not to interfere 
with the horrors we see happening ... on our television sets. From adult 
Westerns to Alien and Gremlins to live coverage of the Vietnam War, 
we watch people bleeding and we remain seated.

Jon Sheen is an aspiring writer stationed in Germany. In 1984 he 
wrote to me as follows: 

“I just witnessed a murder. Don’t worry about me; I’m in no danger: 
the killer was caught immediately. In fact, you probably witnessed the 
same murder, and in the same way: on television. I’m sure you know 
the case I’m talking about: Gary Plauche murdered the man who kidnap- 
ped his son Jody: one Jeffrey Doucet. You’ve seen the same tape. I’m 
sure, and my God, it is astounding! If you were directing a suspense 
film, you couldn’t ask for a more dramatic scene, right down to the way 
the victim’s head eclipses the gun just as the shot is fired. This is the 
third such piece of astounding newsfilm I’ve seen since the beginning of 
February 

“It’s affected me strongly. How, precisely, I don’t know, but watching 
that and, earlier, watching two grown men in Rhode Island walking to 
a car in comical embrace (rendered entirely unamusing by the fact that 
one of the men was a cop, and the other a hunted criminal holding a 
gun to his head) and seeing the car shot to pieces by half-a-dozen cops, 
wounding the captive officer and killing the fugitive; and watching a 
Lebanese man in a light blue shirt writhing in pain, denying that his 
factory held armaments, his right arm broken and mangled and twisted 
within the sleeve — and then, watching the films taken moments later, 

of his corpse being carried away All these will stay with me for a 

long time, and I don’t know how I’m going to judge this new capacity 
to eyewitness mayhem, but when I finally do decide how to react, it 
will be strongly. 

“I know what I’ll have to weigh against it, though: I’ve seen the Shuttle 
launch, and land, live. I’ve seen astronauts floating along through the 
void, untethered — live. I’ve seen the Earth, so huge and blue and beau- 
tiful — even on a 25” RCA — that it made my throat close up. And I was 
one of the first human beings to gaze across the sands of Mars; at the 
same time as Sagan, Hibbs, and the whole gang at JPL, I looked at the 
place that is Mars, watched sliver after sliver of Viking’s-eye-view of 
another planet — live. 

“ ‘Electronic Global Village,’ the man said. 

“Yeah.” 

You don’t feel rich. Right? But you’re very aware of the taxes you 
pay. In California some years ago, it reached the point of a taxpayer 
revolt. We set a legal limit on our property taxes. 

But a taxpayer’s revolt used to mean tax collectors hanging from 
trees! partly because society could not yet afford lampposts. Taxes are 
enormously higher now than they were during the Whiskey Rebellion 
in Vermont. Why aren’t there tax collectors hanging from lamp posts? 

Because even after the tax collector gets through with you, you’ve 



Staying Rich 



63 




still got too much to protect. Because you’re rich. 

And if you don’t feel rich, the little old lady on a fixed income must 
feel still worse as she watches her dollar dwindle to its intrinsic value — 
high quality paper. What is it that’s doing this to you? 

It’s communications. Advertisements! An endless stream of advertise- 
ments! An endless stream of advertisements interspersed with every 
kind of inducement to keep you watching. And while you learn of the 
wonders you can’t afford, you’re also learning not to believe what you 
hear; because after all, these products can’t all be best. What were you 
thinking while you watched the Presidential candidates on your televi- 
sion sets? 

The world is rich, and the easy resources that won the wealth are 
nearly gone. Outcroppings of copper and iron ore. Surface seepages of 
crude oil. Coal and wood: free power. A place to dump the pollution. 
Yes, that was wealth, and is! 

Even coal can’t be mined without technology; the first steam engines 
were built to pump water out of British coal mines. Once mined, the 
coal has to be moved to where it’s needed, somehow. 

If civilization collapsed today, it may be that no future civilization 
could be built on our bones. 

We have a great deal to lose. 

We expect starvation to be rare. 

We expect paved streets. Side-walks. Sidewalks with ramps for wheel- 
chairs. Freeways. Lighted streets at night, all night. Universal schooling. 

We used to expect cheap gasoline. Remember? 

We expect that the streets will be empty of dead bodies in the morning. 
Every morning. All of this is fairly recent. Consider Welfare: for the 
failure, total failure has a bottom limit. Some can crawl back up from 
there. In The Way the Future Was, Frederick Pohl tells of being a 
boy in the Depression. It was ugly, before Welfare. 

We expect help in time of disaster. Communications and easy trans- 
portation will mitigate the effects of famine and flood. Somebody will 
know it’s happening; somebody will come with what we need. 

We expect the freedom to go our own way, without the compulsion 
to be like our neighbors. But being unlike your neighbors has always 
been a crime. Your present freedom of life style depends utterly on your 
freedom to move away from your neighbors, to fmd a place where you 
needn’t comform, or even to fmd people who think like you do. With 
modern communications, you can do that without leaving your living 
room. With real communications, with a wall hologram phone, you could 
accomplish any possible social goal short of exercise or sex! 

We can lose all of that. We can lose more. We can lose the vote. 

Collecting and tabulating votes is terribly expensive. Many nations 



64 



IF 




can’t afford it. We could be one of them, if we continue shipping our 
money to the Arabs while we shut down power plants. T^anny is 
cheaper than democracy. Only one nation in all of Africa offers its 
citizens the vote. Can you name it? It’s the rich one. It’s South Africa. 

We are richer than other nations. If starvation among our neighbors 
didn’t bother us, we wouldn’t be human — and all nations are our neigh- 
bors on this single planet. But the wealthy nations are vulnerable to 
more than guilt. The have-not nations outnumber us. Modem communi- 
cations, including advertisements, have told them what they’re missing, 
and who’s got it. 

We could share the wealth equally — and make the whole world poor. 
Y ou’ve heard that before, but you may not have grasped what it means. 

As long as there have been cities, corpses in city streets have posed 
a continual health problem. 

The police force paid by taxes is a recent invention. 

Murder is a recent invention — as distinctly opposed to killing a man 
who has armed relatives. That has always been dangerous. But killing 
a tramp used to be quite safe. 

Throughout human history, women have been property. In genereil 
women are less muscular than men, more vulnerable to enslavement. 

Slavery in general was the result of better farming techniques. It 
allowed civilized peoples to take prisoners instead of killing them, be- 
cause now they could feed prisoners. The horse collar was a first step 
in freeing slaves; it meant that the horse could do about three times as 
much work as a man, without strangling. But if civilization collapsed 
now, could we afford horses? And grasslands to feed them, instead of 
farms to feed us? Everywhere? I think we’d go back to slavery. 

In the name of “protecting the environment” — surely a laudable aim 
in itself — ^there are those who would oppose all forms of industrial 
power. I believe that they have forgotten what an environment is like 
before men have shaped it. They have forgotten tigers and tsetse flies 
and rabies. It would cost us dearly to lose our present level of civilization. 

We also can’t stay where we are. 

The easy resources are running out, yes, but there’s more to it than 
that. No civilization has ever been able to stay in one place. 

We have to deal, somehow, with the information explosion. The pro- 
liferation of laws and rules and regulations is part of that. Perhaps we 
can be educated to tolerate the flow, assimilate it. Perhaps we need 
information-free vacations — “anarchy parks,” places with no newsflow 
and no rules at all, as laid out in “Cloak of Anarchy” — for our sanity’s 
sake. 

Cars and freeways and airlines give us the freedom to be ourselves, 
but easy transportation carries its own penalties. Almost every state in 



Staying Rich 



65 




the Union has too few state hospitals for the criminally insane. Every 
time a judge sends a patient to a California mental institution, some 
doctor has to decide not whether to put a patient back on the street, 
but whom. Now the patient is out here with me. 

Why can’t we build more psychiatric hospitals, and schools, and pris- 
ons? Because voting citizens are not trapped where they are. Some 
won’t vote their money to improve their neighborhood because it’s 
easier to move. 

We can’t stay the way we are. We have to go up — or down. 

Today we have the power to make the whole world as wealthy as 
we are right now. It would take thirty to fifty years, if we start now . and 
we have to start now. If we wait, we may wait too long. 

I’m pushing space travel. The resources are all up there, and the first 
resource we need is solar power. 

We have several choices as to how to use it. Most people favor picking 
up the sunlight with collectors several miles across — which doesn’t 
mean they’re particularly heavy; the Echo Satellite was both huge and 
flimsy. The collectors would convert the power into microwaves, or 
laser beams, and beam it down to collectors on Earth. 

Or try this. Big, flimsy solar mirrors. Beam the sunlight down directly, 
all to one tiny patch of desert. Nobody would live there, of course. The 
collectors would run at around 350 degrees F. 

Again we face choices. We can carefully intercept only the sunlight 
that would have reached Earth anyway. No heat pollution. Or we can 
pick up light that was on its way to interstellar space. 

Do we want heat pollution? Ocean thermal difference plants (OTEC, 
using the temperature difference between the top and bottom of an 
ocean) produce none. Nuclear plants produce Just as much heat pollution 
per kilowatt as coal plans do. But maybe heat pollution is what we 
want! We’ve got fair evidence that the next Ice Age is starting now. 
Right now. 

We may have been holding off the next Ice Age for the last couple 
of hundred years, just by burning so much of our fossil fuels, polluting 
the troposphere, producing a greenhouse effect. The fuels are running 
out. If we build nuclear plants and put them on line as fast as we can, 
it may be enough; though we’d have to be producing more power, 
because there’s no particulate pollution. But these mirrors would do 
the job for us too. 

There’s second choice, and if you like protecting the environment, 
you’ll love this. Besides beaming power down to the factories from 
orbit, we can move the factories into orbit, and beyond. 

The resources of the Moon include metals and oxygen-bearing rock, 
and more. Astronauts who have worked on Earth, in free fall, and on 

66 IF 




the Moon, prefer the Moon for working conditions. Something has been 
leached from Earthly soil over billions of years; mix lunar dust into it 
and the plants fall in love. 

A nickel-iron asteroid a mile across would hold five years’ worth of 
the Earth’s total production of metals, in metal deposits richer than any 
now to be found on Earth. If you like iridium, you’ll love the asteroids; 
it was that which gave Alvarez his clue to the extermination of the 
dinosaurs. We’ll probably find water ice; certainly we’ll find water loosely 
bound in compounds. 

Behind the problem you just solved you will find another problem, 
always. There are social implications to making the whole world rich. 
“The poor are always with us — ” up to now. Somebody’s going to face 
a hell of a servant problem. 

Well, we’ll burn that bridge when we come to it.

Savage Cinema 

scattered thoughts on the state of SF on film 
by Ralph Sevush 



I’m still upset. I mean, it’s been 
months since the Academy Awards 
and I’m still cursing those cretins for 
their lack of vision. They have once 
again ignored the Science Fiction, Hor- 
ror and Fantasy genres in their ballot- 
ing, and I think it’s time to break out 
those high explosives. 

If the members of the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, that 
bastion of self-aggrandizement, were 
not already brain-dead from substance 
abuse, they might occasionally ac- 
knowledge the films that have been 
the life blood of the industry since its 
inception. 

But no . every year the pretentious 
hacks, insecure artists, aging queens, 
and cigar-smoking barbarians gather 
together, in their frilliest finery, to an- 
noint some fine example of main- 
stream mediocritiy as Best Picture of 
the year. Then, they toss around some 
more accolades to movies that also 
mistake importance of subject for im- 
portance of content. The cemonization 
of films like GHANDI, CHARIOTS OF 
FIRE, KRAMER VS KRAMER, and this 
year’s OUT OF AFRICA and THE 
COLOR PURPLE does a great disser- 
vice to the unique qualities of cinema. 

68 IF 



Movies are science fiction. The sub- 
tle blending of light and movement, 
created by technology, brings three di- 
mensional life to a two dimensional 
surface. As we sit here, in the dark, we 
are awash in the flickering illusion. We 
are swept to whatever worlds the 
storyteller takes us, and we feel be- 
trayed if that world is dull or cliched — 
or worse still, if we are taken nowhere 
at all. 

Movies, then, have a unique capacity 
for Fantasy ... a capacity greater than 
that of any other art form. It would 
seem that SF, Fantasy and Horror 
would be most well-suited to exploring 
those potentialities, and the public is 
well aware of this. It is not by accident 
that many of the top grossing films of 
all time are contained by these genres. 
People instinctively know that nothing 
in a movie is more satisfying than fan- 
tasy, and the dreams that come true 
in the darkness fade quickly in the 
light. 

I’m not suggesting that great films 
haven’t been made outside of these 
genres, nor do I imply that they won’t 
be made in the future. Obviously, 
filmmakers from Allen to Zinnemann 
have created beautiful and moving 




works that are certain to endure as 
long as the culture does. 

All I would intimate to the Academy 
members is that such critically elemen- 
tal modes of cinematic expression not 
be so consistently overlooked in their 
annual tribal ritual. 

And it has been consistent. In the 58 
year history of the Academy Awards, 
the number of Oscar nominations gar- 
nered by the SF/F/H films could dance 
with the angels on the head of a pin. 
There are 7 m^or award categories; 
Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor, 
Actress, Supporting Actor, and Sup- 
porting Actress (these categories re- 
ceive the most media attention and so 
have the greatest impact on public 
opinion, which also translates into $$ 
at the box office). If you assume an 
average of 5 nominations per category, 
over 58 years, this results in over 2000 
nominations and over 400 winners. Of 
this huge sum, only the following 20 
SF films have ever been acknowledged 
by the Academy: 

* DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

In looking over this list, some things 
come to mind. First, there are only 2 
winners on this list. Second, 2001 
wasn’t even nominated for Best Pic- 
ture. Third, more than half of these 
pictures have been made since 1977, 
the year of the mega-hits STAR WARS 
and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. Most im- 
portantly, there are no films on this 
list from 1952-1964, considered by 
many to be the most fertile period in 
the history of the SF cinema. 

If you add all the fantasy and horror 
films that have received nominations, 
the list doubles and would include ev- 
erything from PSYCHO and THE 
EXORCIST to HERE COMES MR. JOR- 
DAN and its remake, HEAVEN CAN 
WAIT. Even at that, ^ough, all these 
genres combined have only gotten 
about 60 nominations and 6 Oscars, 
about S% of the total figure. 

It is apparent, then, that Hollywood 
did not take SF seriously until Lucas 
and Spielberg, having grown up with 
those neglected classics from the 50’s, 
practically re-invented the form and 
grossed huge amounts of money. So, 
finally, some attention was paid. 

Not, however, a great deal of atten- 
tion. The voting members, you see, do 
not wish to appear to be the greedy 
swine that they are. So, though they 
chum out formula movies based on 
the superior work of those filmmakers 
that allow them to stay hip deep in 
cocaine, they give the awards to the 
bullshit “prestige” films in order to 
convince the public of their artistic in- 
tegrity. What Hollywood is about is 
IMAGE, which should not come as a 
revelation to anyone. 

To get a better look at the films that 
have been neglected by the Academy 
over the years, here is another list of 
20 films. It has been compiled by cross- 
referencing the “10 Best” lists of such 
writers as Arthur C. Clarke, Brian Al- 
diss and Harry Harrison, and such film 

70 IF 



scholars as Tom Milne and Peter 
Nicholls, as well as various French cri- 
tics. In chronological order, here are 
20 of the greatest SF films of all time: 

* METROPOLIS (1926) 

* FRANKENSTEIN (1931) 

* KING KONG (1933) 

* THINGS TO COME (1936) 

* THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD 
STILL (1951) 

* THE THING (1951) 

* THEM! (1954) 

* FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956) 

* INVASION OF THE BODY 
SNATCHERS (1956) 

* THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING 
MAN (1957) 

* QUARTERMASS II (1957) 

* DR. STRANGELOVE (1964) 

* ALPHAVILLE (1965) 

* 2001 (1968) 

* SOLARIS (1971) 

* A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971) 

* THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH 
(1976) 

* ALIEN (1979) 

* BLADE RUNNER (1982) 

* THE ROAD WARRIOR (1983) 

Not one film on this list has won a 
m£gor Academy Award, and only 3 (all 
directed by Kubrick) have even been 
nominated. It should be noted that 
SOLARIS, ALPHAVILLE (both foreign 
films), and METROPOUS (pre-1927) 
were not eligible for the awards. Still, 
Hollywood’s ability to disregard these 
films has been an amazing accomplish- 
ment. 

This year, it seems, there might be 
a new film to add to this list of neg- 
lected masterworks. It is BRAZIL, 
Terry Gilliam’s furmy, dark vision of 
our distopian future. It is a flawed but 
brilliant creation, surely one of the 
most stylistically original films to 
come along in eons. Gilham has re- 
made Orwell’s “1984” with visual 
bravado and laughter bom of fear. 




Unfortunately, that fear extended to 
the Hollywood studio executives who 
saw in GiUiam’s work only that it was 
too long and had an unhappy ending. 
A struggle ensued, as the studio tried 
to coerce him into butchering his work 
to meet their Luddite standards. When 
the film opened to critical acclaim in 
Europe in its original form. Universal 
was forced to modify its position. 
When the film won ^e LA. critics 
award for Best Picture after a limited 
engagement there, the studio’s hand 
was forced again. After a brief but 
moderately successful run in NY, Uni- 
versal finally gave the film a national 
release. Gilliam succeeded in getting 
his vision on the screen, but the bitter- 
ness he caused certainly played a role 
in the Academy’s subsequent snubbing 
of his film. 

It is interesting, though, that they did 
nominate KISS OF THE SPIDERWO- 
MAN for a host of awards, including 
best picture. In its stagy and plodding 



way, that film explores our need for 
fantasy and celebrates the role that the 
movies have played in providing it. It 
is, however, a static, pretentious load 
of trash . inferior in every way to 
Woody AUen’s PURPLE ROSE OF 
CAIRO, which addresses the same 
themes with cinematic brilliance. 
Needless to say, Allen’s film had to set- 
tle, like BRAZIL, for a token nomina- 
tion for Best Screenplay. 

I am much calmer now, as this out- 
pouring of bile has exhausted my indig- 
nation. I have put away those explo- 
sives, at least for another year. Perhaps 
it is best, after all, that Hollywood con- 
tinue to ignore the creative contribu- 
tions of SF/F/H films. As Brian Aldiss 
said, “If the SF cinema is to retain vit- 
ahty and subversive intent, it must re- 
main a minority taste, and not try to 
perennially hit the warm heart of Mid- 
dle America.” 

So there . but remember to keep 
your powder dry. 




SCENE FROM BRAZIL. MRS. LOWRY VISITS HER PLASTIC SURGEON

RING SHOT

The little girl stumbled into a 
thorn bush, whimpered, then 
stopped walking and wiped her 
eyes. “Where are we goingT she 
said petulantly. “Where are we any- 
way?” 

The stout young man in hunting 
clothes reached down and hefted 
his daughter up into his broad 
arms. “I’ll carry you a while, Amy,” 
he said in a low voice. “We’re lost, 
sweetie, but if we keep going on 
the same compass course, we’re 
bound to run into something.” 
“Yeh, more woods,” said the 
trimmer, plain-faced young woman 
in ripped grey slacks and a ski jack- 
et, walking beside him. 

“Hey Peg,” said her husband, al- 
ready puffing with the weight of 
his daughter, “this is Rhode Island. 
You can walk across the whole 
thing in two days.” 

“I knew we should have stayed 
in that apartment,” she snapped 
back. “It was crazy getting into 
those traffic jams. No gas. It was 
stupid!”

Her husband shook his head 
tiredly. “Don’t remake history. Peg. 
The cops had guns. They told us 
to go, for God’s sake!” 

“You’ve got a gun!” said his wife 
with a snarl. 

David Bidwell quickly yet gently 
put his daughter back on the 
ground and straightened up, his 
round, usually-cheerful face 
flushed with anger, his hands plan- 
ted on broad hips. “Great!” he 
snarled back. “I’m supposed to 
take on a SWAT team with a thirty- 
thirty hunting rifle with you and 
Amy there, huh? Don’t be so 
stupidl We never had a choice in 
any of this.” 

“We had a choice of getting lost 
or getting to Westerly!” his wife 
spat back. 

“The map they gave us was use- 
less,” said David, but now he spoke 
more quietly. “Okay, so we guessed 
wrong in some places and we 
started with half a tank. Did you 
want to go into that station with 
the two guys on the ground and all

the blood on the apron? Did you!” 

Peggy Bidwell was about to 
make another angry retort when 
her eyes opened wide and she put 
a trembling hand on her husband’s 
arm. “David,” she breathed, 
“Smoke . and close!” 

Sure enough, over the next small 
hill, coming up over the scattered 
trees and underbrush was a thin 
colunm of white smoke, drifting 
east in a gentle breeze. 

David Bidwell looked around, 
then went to a large rock where 
he unslung his rifle and carefully 
hid it among some mossy ferns. “If 
they don’t want us, we’ll just leave, 
but there’s no point coming up like 
we offered trouble.” His wife said 
nothing and Amy, suddenly sens- 
ing the tense fright of her parents, 
seized her father’s hand tightly and 
said nothing more as they walked 
slowly through the sparse woods 
toward the rising smoke. 

They came in hesitations and 
pauses over the rise to a clearing 
with several small outbuildings, a 
trail bike leaning against a tree, and 
what appeared to be a prefabri- 
cated cabin in the center with the 
smoke coming from its cin- 
derblock chimney. Sitting on the 
front stoop was a portly, very old 
man dressed in a rough tweed Jack- 
et, jeans, and wearing a Swedish 
yachting cap. He was busily clean- 
ing a World War Two Sten sub- 
machine gun. 

He looked up, saw them at once, 
and sent them a big smile. “Hi 
there,” he called out. “You folks are 
lost, I suppose?” 

His cheerful tone brought them 



walking rapidly forward while 
David smiled and nodded in the 
most positive gestures he could 
manage. “You’re right, sir. We were 
in the convoy to Westerly . that’s 
our host city in the relocation 
plan . but the traffic got so jam- 
med they set us all off in groups 
over the back roads. Well . ” 
David shrugged, “we just ran out 
of gas. The maps they gave us were 
useless since the roads are shut 
now through most of the towns.” 

The old man peered profession- 
ally down the barrel of his gun, 
then grinned up at them. “Hell, the 
Civil Defense honchos in Provi- 
dence and Washington knew they 
weren’t going anywhere,” he said 
cheerfully, “so the maps didn’t in- 
terest them very much. They’ve got 
those underground places right 
close for their gang.” He gave a thin 
chuckle. “Won’t do them a damn 
bit of good, of course. For once 
the captain and the officers will be 
going down in the vessel with the 
rest of the crew.” He sighed and 
shook his head. “Cold comfort for 
people as young as you folks.” 

“Could I have a glass of water, 
please?” said Amy politely to the 
old man. 

He got to his feet nodding. “You 
can if you tell me your name. I’m 
Phillip Stewart Hoskins, but you 
better call me Uncle Phil, I think.” 

“I’m Amy Bidwell,” said the child 
directly. “How old are you. Uncle 
Phil?” 

Hoskins gave her a measured 
look, his small, round eyes twinkl- 
ing. “If I tell you, Amy, will you tell 
me if I look that old and then tell 



74 



IF 




me how old you are?” 

“I will if you’ll then tell me if I 
look that old too,” said Amy 
quickly and with a bright smile. 

“Done!” said the chuckling old 
man. “Okay, I’m eighty-one.” 

Amy looked at him more closely, 
then tilted her head in deep 
thought. “Well,” she said finally, 
“you don’t look quite as old as 
Granny, and she’s only seventy- 
nine.” 

Hoskins roared with laughter, 
his round cheeks puffing out. “The 
nicest compliment I’ve had in ten 
years,” he said to David and Peggy, 
who were now almost smiling 
themselves. 

“And I’m six-and-a-half,” said 
Amy seriously. 

The old man pursed his lips and 
stroked his pudgy chin. “Funny,” 
he said in a slow, puzzled voice. “I 
would have guessed seven-and-a- 
half, if a day. You sure you’re 
counting right?” 

The little girl turned at once to 
her mother. “Are we, mom? I mean, 
you should know . .?” 

Peggy Bidwell finally saw that 
they had, through some miracle, 
stumbled on a friendly haven, and 
she suddenly laughed out loud, the 
first time in days. “I guess I should 
know, Amy!” she said, then added, 
“Mr. Hoskins . .” 

“Uncle Phil, now . 

“Yes, well I think Uncle Phil is 
just saying that you’re a very ma- 
ture girl for your age . We’re 
Peggy and David, Uncle Phil.” 

The old man picked up his gun 
and cleaning tools and held open 
the screen door. “Come on in. How 



about some orange juice, Amy? 
Water can be boring, boring, 
boring.” 

“That would be lovely,” said the 
girl, now looking around the big 
central room in wonder, for it con- 
tained books at every level and in 
every crevice. A table and several 
chairs filled the center of the room 
while an ancient player piano 
crouched in one corner and a huge 
desk covered with papers and the 
connected parts of a small micro- 
computer in another, but other- 
wise there were books every- 
where. 

Hoskins opened a small door 
next to the fireplace and carefully 
put the Sten gun into a narrow 
closet also containing, the Bid- 
wells saw, several other weapons. 
“Don’t worry about all that ordi- 
nance,” said Hoskins slamming the 
door shut and turning to grin at 
them. “I can easily see that you 
folks are solid citizens, but on a 
day like this one, you never know 
until it’s over what might happen 
or who might come.” 

He went into the small, lean-to 
kitchen at the back and soon re- 
turned with a big glass of orange 
juice. As he handed this to Amy he 
peered sideways at the adults from 
under thick, drawn eyebrows. “I 
gather the name, Hoskins, meant 
nothing to you people?” he said in 
a tentative voice. 

Peggy shook her head at once, 
but David had been thinking about 
the slightly-familiar name since the 
old man had spoken it. Suddenly 
his eyes went wide and he turned 
to look carefully at the old man. 



Ring Shot 



75 




“That scientist ...” he said softly, 
“the guy who defected to Rus- 
sia .. Oh, wow!” 

Hoskins beamed at the large 
young man and turned, as though 
in a lineup, to show all sides of his 
puffy face. “Yes, they really made 
a big thing about it. Actually, a 
good friend about my age went to 
Berlin on my passport, dropped 
out of sight there, and came back 
using, ah, other documents. In any 
case, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have 
been any safer in Russia. Less safe, 
if anything, since probably only 
half of their weapons will detonate 
properly.” He sighed again, then 
gave them a smile. “Say, how about 
a beer to charm away these final 
moments?” 

David and Peggy nodded dumbly 
and when he returned, Hoskins 
also carried a shoe box along with 
the beer cans. “Amy,” he said, 
“when my grandaughter, Ruth, 
came to visit me years ago, she 
played with this china village. But 
the rule is, only on the big bed in 
the little room over there. This is 
a very fragile village so you mustn’t 
let parts of its knock together.” 

He shook his head sternly. “I’m 
afraid some of the cows have suf- 
fered serious leg wounds from 
Ruth’s cattle stampedes, but I 
know that a girl of your advanced 
age will realize that there is no- 
thing anywhere more placid than 
small, china cows.” 

The girl delightedly carried the 
box into the small room and they 
heard her exclamations of joy over 
the china houses, people and lives- 
tock packed in layers of cotton.

“Sir, uh. Uncle Phil,” said David, 
“why haven’t they found you 
here?” 

Hoskins gestured them to seats 
around his small, central table, 
then shrugged as he popped open 
his beer can. “They weren’t look- 
ing, I suppose. They assumed I had 
gone east, to the nasties. People in 
Washington tend to think the worst 
about the rest of us.” 

“Is there going to be a war?” said 
Peggy, leaning to put a hand on the 
old man’s arm. 

Hoskins wrinkled his nose. “I’m 
not sure that war is what to call 
it.” He got up and went over to his 
wide desk, then studied a disor- 
derly mass of spread-out papers. 
“You see, from first launch to 
warhead separation somewhere 
over the middle of Canada takes 
about fifteen minutes . Then they 
have to slow up and maneuver 
some of the weapons to form the 
ring in a resonant manner, so 
maybe six ... ah, say ten minutes 
more until the shot is complete. 
Within ten or fifteen minutes the 
fires will have coalesced and set 
the air masses in motion. If 
counter-launch occurs at, say, mi- 
nute eight, the resonances will lag 
a bit, but the Soviets have more 
trees.” He shrugged, his face 
twisted in contempt and anger. 
“Say one hour until the earth is 
dead. Is that long enough to call it 
a war . .?” 

The young couple stared speech- 
less at his calm, now angry smile, 
his sharp, twinkling eyes. “The 
truth won’t make you free,” said 
Hoskins slowly, “but maybe it will 




help. So listen close and I’ll tell you 
what’s going to happen. You’ve 
never heard the term, ‘ring shot’, I 
suppose?” 

David spread out his thick hands 
in a gesture of guilt. “I’m a pro- 
grammer in an accounting firm and 
Peg teaches first grade. I guess we 
should have paid more attention 
to what was happening,” he said 
in a lame voice. 

“Everybody in the world is going 
to be repeating that lament pretty 
quick,” said Hoskins drily, “but 
without a secret clearance you 
would have never known about it 
anyway. Mother Jones missed it 
completely and if the Times knew, 
the news didn’t fit what they 
wanted to print. 

“Okay, I was a physicist with a 
specialty in the study of the atmos- 
phere; sort of a glorified and 
theoretical weather man. A few 
years ago I published a series of 
papers on computational and 
analytical methods, using large- 
frame computers, to predict what 
are called ‘trigger events’ in the at- 
mosphere. The method seemed to 
have promise in the early predic- 
tion of hurricanes and, most espe- 
cially, in tornado study and warn- 
ing. Unfortunately,” the old man’s 
face hardened and his stained, old 
teeth clenched, “the method can 
also lead to designs of nuclear at- 
tacks, of which the most terrible 
is the Resonant Interspaced Nu- 
clear Grouping technique which 
those insects in Washington with 
their stupid acronyms have natur- 
ally called, the ring shot!” 

He stared at them, his face set 



and again angry. “When you deploy 
and detonate fifteen or so 
warheads, all carried by a single 
rocket, in a particular sequential, 
geographic and altitude pattern, 
you can trigger a hundred- 
thousand square miles of atmos- 
phere into a single, circular cyc- 
lonic pattern. The initial firestorms 
will join, augment each other, until 
the entire ring of fire organizes a 
single, vast weather system. Winds 
inside this system will exceed two- 
hundred-miles-an-hour. No living 
thing inside the ring will be able 
to withstand the wind-driven 
flames during such a catastrophe. 
Concrete, aluminum siding, bricks, 
everything will burn. A single large 
missile, so programmed, can de- 
vastate a third of this country.” 
Hoskin’s voice had risen in in- 
tensity to this final statement while 
Peg and David stared at him in 
complete dismay. “They . they 
wouldn’t use a thing like that . .?” 
said David, shaking his big head. 

The old man’s eyes glinted. 
“They would if they thought the 
other side didn’t have it. But wait, 
you haven’t heard it all. Listen now! 
It’s important. After the first two 
parts of my paper had been pub- 
lished, the editor of the journal 
called me up. He was an old friend 
and he risked his career to make 
that call. The people from 
Washington had seized the manu- 
scripts, working proofs, back is- 
sues involving my articles. He told 
me to run, to go to Zurich and see 
a particular physicist, another old 
friend, who now lived there.” 
Hoskins rubbed his hands as 



Ring Shot

though to warm him from a re- 
membered chiU. “I went that night 
and that call saved me. 1 shaved 
off my beard, my hair too, dressed 
in my one suit that I never wore, 
and headed for the airport. The 
plane was full but I got on first 
class, used my credit cards. I had 
never done anything like that be- 
fore. My wife and I, before she died, 
always went tourist with people 
like you three, at a discount, tickets 
bought weeks ahead. 

‘The Swiss passport man ques- 
tioned my picture but I was ready. 
I let my cheeks sag, my shoulders 
slump . not too hard to do, under 
the circumstances . and said I 
had lost my hair to chemotherapy, 
that I was in Switzerland to see 
specialists.” 

The old man gave them a confid- 
ant wink. “He couldn’t have been 
nicer, found a man to lug my stuff, 
a cab, the whole bit. In Zurich I 
went to the apartment of my friend 
and there I learned how my life- 
long, peaceful efforts had provided 
the final keystone to the terrible 
ring shot and other abominations. 

“Listen!” said Hoskins suddenly 
and intently to them. “We are not 
without hope, you two! Listen and 
understand, for faith and resolu- 
tion may save us when all else fails. 
And strange and awful as the ring 
shots may seem to you folks, far 
stranger events may face us.” 
Somehow his intensity had caught 
them up and they could only nod 
in stupified agreement. 

“We made more calculations in 
Zurich. It was a dreadful few weeks 
but there could be no doubt. If our 



missiles created even a single fire- 
ring vortex in the Russian heart- 
land while they were producing a 
comparable pattern over our mid- 
west, the source-sink effect across 
the globe could set up an intercon- 
tinental circulation that would ac- 
tually eject the atmosphere into 
outer space, the flow being driven 
by the huge pressure defects in the 
rings. Yet only two of these attacks 
were trivial. Clearly each side will 
launch many, so any threshold un- 
certainties in the calculations are 
of no meaning. The answer is 
clearly that we will lose our entire 
atmosphere in a very few minutes 
after the source-sink phenomenon 
is established. Understand, the ef- 
fect is synergic, that is, the pres- 
sure imbalance and the ejection 
rate grow as the atmospheric loss 
procedes.” 

He paused, sighed, and pointed 
in the direction of the player piano. 
“On that piano is a recording 
barograph so that I can know when 
the pressure decrease begins.” He 
shook his head. “The air loss will 
be swift, a few minutes at best, but 
I thought it would be a good idea 
to get the whole curve on that 
gadget . .” 

They sat silent until Peg blinked 
and shook her head, her eyes blank 
with shock. “Who would read it. 
Uncle Phil . with all the air 
gone?” she whispered. 

His more cheerful smile re- 
turned. “A sensible question. Peg, 
Think of it as a final, gallant puff 
on the cigarette as the firing squad 
cocks its rifles ... or an old man 
muttering in fear-besotted senility.

IF 




But let me continue with my story 
of Zurich. There was formed years 
ago in Western Europe a quiet 
group of men and women, scien- 
tists, thinkers, philosophers. As 
they watched Washington and 
Moscow sink into wretched post- 
uring and madness they sought 
ways to slow or change the dread- 
ful business. At first these people 
identified the very smartest young 
scholars. They had found sophisti- 
cated ways to spot them, through 
university records, structural 
analysis of their publications, 
many other ways, and these young 
thinkers were then recruited away 
from high-energy and weapons 
studies into wholly new paths of 
research and scholarship, an at- 
tempted synthesis of all human ac- 
tivity. Some few were even brought 
out of the eastern nations and Rus- 
sia. They hoped, in this manner, to 
prevent any more so-called break- 
throughs in large weapons systems 
and, at the same time, seek a total 
and radical solution to the world’s 
fatal problems.” 

The old man was now thoughtful 
and his mood was somber. “They 
did not contact me because I was 
old, in my seventies, and ideas that 
underlie such freakish horrors as 
the ring shot almost always come 
from the very-bright young, the 
new PhD.s. But alas, ‘almost’ is not 
good enough and when I began to 
publish my papers on atmospheric 
triggering, they had men who saw 
at once what I had not seen. They 
realized then that their cause was 
hopeless, that they did not have 
the resources or abilities to find 



everyone in the world who might 
discover a way to end it.” 

Hoskins sucked thoughtfully on 
his beer can. “Once we decided 
that several northern-hemisphere 
ring shots would cause the ulti- 
mate trigger effect, the group 
realized they must keep me from 
the authorities lest I be forced to 
help produce this final insanity. It 
was evident to the people in Zurich 
that both east and west were at- 
tempting to achieve the fire-ring 
first. The group had contacts 
everywhere and almost unlimited 
resources. After all, who has more 
to lose than the very wealthy? They 
arranged to buy this old hunting 
place, then work out my ‘defection’ 
from Berlin and get me secretly 
back to the States. But I am only 
a small part of their salvage ef 
forts . .” 

At this moment the small radio 
perched on a book shelf that had 
been muttering along on low vol- 
ume began to give a thin, steady 
shriek. 

The old man’s face instantly be- 
came ashen and his hands, that had 
gestured so firmly and with such 
angry movements, now simply 
shook. “How quickly it comes . .” 
he gasped. “You see ... I never re- 
ally believed it myself ... in my 
heart . .” but then he recovered 
himself almost as quickly, got to 
his feet, and walked to the radio 
to turn it up slightly. The shriek 
continued for another half a mi- 
nute and Hoskins, his face now re- 
gaining its normal, ruddy color, 
curled his lips in contempt and dis- 
gust. “Who launched first. I won- 



Ring Shot 



79 




der?” he said bitterly. “Let’s see 
how efficiently they’ll give us our 
epitaphs.” 

The shriek suddenly stopped 
and a deep, modulated voice came 
smoothly out of the tiny radio. “At- 
tention. This is not a test. The Pres- 
ident of the United States has just 
announced that about seven mi- 
nutes ago, at least nine large mis- 
siles left their launching sites in 
the Soviet Union. These weapons 
are aimed at targets throughout 
the United States. Our forces are 
now retaliating in overwhelming 
strength to prevent any further at- 
tacks. Everyone listening to this 
message should go immediately to 
the center of their dwelling space 
and as far below ground level as 
possible. Persons in vehicles . .” 

Hoskins shut off the radio and 
as he returned to his seat in the 
sudden, total silence, they all heard 
Amy get down off the bed in the 
other room and walk over to the 
open, bedroom door. She walked 
slowly and gently for in the hollow 
of her cupped hands sat a small, 
china shepherdess in flounced 
skirt and puffed sleeves and bear- 
ing through a tiny hole in her 
closed hand, a golden wire crook. 
Amy stopped and looked at them 
across the room. 

“What did Ruth call this lady?” 
she asked the old man in a serious 
voice. 

Hoskins took a deep, shuddering 
breath, smoothed back his sparse 
white hair with a slight tremble, 
then completely concerned him- 
self with the little girl’s question. 
“Well, Ruthie called her Marie An- 

80 IF 



toinette.” He gave Amy a cheerful 
shrug. “That lady was Queen of 
France and she liked to dress up 
and pretend she was a shepher- 
dess. I told Ruth that she needed 
Versailles Palace to keep such a 
grand lady happy, but that didn’t 
seem to change her mind.” 

Amy nodded, then turned to go 
back through the door. “I like 
Marie,” she said in a thoughtful 
tone. “That’s a very good name for 
such a pretty lady.” 

Peggy Bidwell’s eyes had sud- 
denly spurted tears as her daughter 
turned to reenter the bedroom and 
her mouth, indeed her whole face, 
was now contorted into a silent 
scream of “Amy!” but the old man 
had darted out of his seat and over 
to her side. He seized the young 
woman tightly in both his arms and 
urgently pressed his lips to her ear. 

“No, Peg! Stop!” he whispered. 
“Now, if ever, you must be steady! 
Steadiness is everything. Amy may 
be our salvation, but you must 
keep her from this!” 

Her flood of grief was dammed 
and softened by the old man’s 
fierce, quiet words and now David 
also held his wife in his large arms 
as she snuffled, then rubbed her 
eyes and blinked silently. 

“We are pressed,” said Hoskins 
to them in a tight voice, “but there 
is time left. And perhaps what I 
will tell you now is best said at the 
very end, so there will be no long 
time to consider and question it.” 
He seized Peggy’s hand in a tight, 
passionate grip. “You two, teacher 
and programmer, you must have 
gone to college and somewhere in 




those years you must have heard 
some philosopher discourse on the 
nature of reality, and on the re- 
lationship between human percep- 
tion and reality. Now listen! What 
those people in that brilliant, se- 
cret group, in Zurich and else- 
where, have come to believe is 
beyond imagination and beyond 
hope! To put it briefly, they have 
shown a direct, causal relationship 
between the development of per- 
ception and consciousness in self- 
conscious beings and the increas- 
ing complexity of the universe. 
Once you understand it, the evi- 
dence is everywhere! In the di- 
nosaur bones, in meteorites, in the 
cells of living things. Saying it as 
simply as possible, as humankind 
has developed ways of seeing and 
studying natural phenomena, 
those phenomena have progres- 
sively developed and deepened its 
very structure. The old question 
concerning the meaning of the 
sound of a tree falling with no one 
near enough to hear it was not tri- 
vial, but the truth is grander and 
even more astonishing. Once nerv- 
ous, self-conscious being can hear 
sound, then there is sound from 
then on. That’s how it works!” 

He stared sternly at them, then 
flicked an eye at his watch. David 
Bidwell had been closely following 
the old man’s words, nodding 
thoughtfully, but now he shook his 
head in dismay. “For God’s sake. 
Uncle Phil. Then every time we 
build a bigger telescope, somebody 
or something has to put more stuff 
way out in the sky . masses of 
stuff! 1 mean . .” 



“Exactly!” said Hoskins, point- 
ing a fierce and steady finger at 
him. “Exactly what happens, and 
there is proof of that too, but we 
have no time for it.” 

David continued to shake his 
head. “All that stuff, all that chang- 
ing . why? Just because we get 
clever at studying something? That 
can’t be possible!” 

Hoskins shook his head back in 
sudden anger. “Don’t be stupid and 
claim you know what’s possible 
and what isn’t. The favorite cos- 
mological theory today among 
western, estabhshment savants, 
those same men who have also 
given us this appalling and abomin- 
able moment about to come, is that 
the universe began as a tiny, infi- 
nitely-dense speck, smaller than 
the tiniest speck of dust on this 
floor and with a lifetime at birth 
of ten-to-the-minus-forty-fifth of a 
second. Does that totally incom- 
prehensible, stupidly useless and 
philosophically banal sort of 
model please you any better, sir!” 
The old man’s small, pudgy 
finger now waved directly under 
David’s large nose, while with his 
other hand he pointed rigidly at the 
door to his bedroom. “That child,” 
he said in a hissing, fierce whisper, 
“has created a whole village, a 
whole society, on that blanket. If 
you could take it all from her 
head . Right now! . the detail of 
geography, history, social mores, 
family life, everything, would be 
beyond words to encompass, yet 
she is six-and-a-half. Who are you 
to say what can and cannot happen 
in the cosmos, when your own 



Ring Shot 



81 




small daughter can already create 
whole worlds that you cannot pos- 
sibly enter!” 

“None of it makes sense,” said 
David doggedly, but his wife, her 
eyes now dry and her face set and 
desperate, seized his arm in a 
strong grip. 

“Listen to him, David!” she said 
intently. “What else have we got? 
Listen! My God, listen^ 

Hoskins nodded in gratitude at 
her. “If their theory is not true, then 
all life on earth will end within the 
next few minutes. But suppose 
they are right? What happens to an 
entire, evolving universe when the 
consciousness that has created it, 
given it meaning, is suddenly and 
totally eliminated? What?” 

He stared fixedly at them until 
Peggy shook her head, her hands 
trembling, her face collapsing. 
“This is all beyond us. Uncle 
Phil ...” a lassitude of despair. 

Hoskins seized her hand to 
steady and squeeze it. “No one 
knows what will happen, Peg. But 
they have all theorized, those in 
the group with appropriate special- 
ties, and there were many ideas 
produced, even during the short 
time I was with them in Europe. 
But let me tell you, finally and 
quickly, about one afternoon in a 
Zurich park with Jacob Hirschman, 
for of all of them, I believe he has 
the deepest insight, the most reli- 
able model.” 

Hoskins looked again at his 
watch, then at the barograph, and 
he spoke carefully. “Hirschman is 
a philosophical mathematician of 
the finest sort, younger than I am. 



but still old and thoughtful. He had 
turned his mind to this great 
paradox of creation and destruc- 
tion for some time and on my last 
afternoon in Zurich, as I waited to 
be secreted back to this house 
some months ago, I walked with 
Jacob in the park to watch him 
feed the pigeons. I asked him there, 
when we were alone, what he plan- 
ned to be doing when the ring shots 
were fired. It was an obvious ques- 
tion that transcended and utterly 
simplified his dense and 
mathematical predictions circu- 
lated among group members. 

“He smiled at me when I asked 
that, but he answered at once. ‘If 
it comes at night, Phillip, I plan to 
be reading in my favorite chair 
some well-loved work. Possibly 
War and Peace, but perhaps not. 
The book will be selected when 
the time arrives. He peered at me 
fi"om large, quiet eyes. ‘If you ex- 
pect to make the transition, Phillip, 
you must insure that it is as simple 
and probable as you possibly can. 
Those crouched in shelters and 
cellars, their minds choked with 
red rage, inconsolable grief, and 
blind terror will have no way to fit 
into any alternate, more benign, re- 
ality. And that reality must appear, 
old friend. The cosmos cannot 
exist without us. We must, some- 
how, be fitted in.’ 

“‘And during the daytime?’ I 
asked him then.” 

“ ‘Feeding the pigeons, of 
course,’ he said, gesturing at the 
sever£il dozen birds strutting and 
pecking here and there. Then he 
added, ‘And having, most impor-

tant of all, very pigeon-feeding 
thoughts.’” 

Hoskins stared deeply into each 
of their faces. “Do you understand 
what he was saying? You must! We 
three, and God be thanked, greatly 
helped by Amy, must think nothing 
but pigeon-feeding thoughts from 
now on! You must seize that final 
courage in your innermost souls if 
we are to have a chance of survival. 
Now, on your feet, cheerful, smil- 
ing, and if you love each other and 
your child, sing and dance now 
from the utter core of your hearts!” 

“Amy,” called the old man as he 
walked over to turn on the player 
piano, “how would you like to 
come in here and sing some songs 
with us at the piano?” 

She appeared in a moment at the 
door, the china shepherdess cra- 
dled again in her hands. “Can Marie 
come too?” she asked. 

“Absolutely,” said Hoskins, “but 
I think you’ll find her voice rather 
high and squeaky . quite hard to 
hear at all, actually,” he added with 
a grin. 

Amy giggled at this and began a 
long, slow, sliding walk across the 
room so that there would be no 
chance of the china figure suffer- 
ing a collision or jolt. But the old 
man stood rock-steady watching 
her from the piano, his round, 
ruddy face mild and avuncular in 
expression and only with the 
tiniest dart of an eye did he, now 
and then, catch a glance at the 
barograph chart or his watch. 

Hoskins finally took the small 
figurine from the little girl’s lifted 
hands and gently raised it up to set 



it well back from the edge of the 
piano top. “There,” he said, “she 
can watch, even if she can’t carry 
a tune. He turned and poked into 
a large case of piano roll boxes. 
“Let’s try Beautiful Ohio," he mut- 
tered, threading the roll and start- 
ing the vacuum motor, then sitting 
down on the piano stool. 

Amy now stood next to him. “I 
don’t know the words to that. 
Uncle Phil,” she said. 

“They’re right on the roll,” said 
the old man as the music started, 
“and I know you must be a speedy 
reader.” 

Amy soon learned to coordinate 
the printed words moving down- 
ward with the tune, and her high, 
sweet voice drew them all in loudly 
so that the song ended with a series 
of cheers and handclaps, mostly 
from Amy. As the roll rewound 
swiftly, Hoskins looked over at the 
barograph, and seeing no change 
in the steady line, removed the roll 
and pulled out another one. 

“Okay,” he said, “that one was 
from the farmlands so it must be 
time for the big city,” and the man- 
dolin-style tinkle of Sidewalks of 
New York filled the room. Their 
voices rose and fell, following the 
old song. “I voted for A1 Smith,” 
said Hoskins reflectively during a 
piano interlude. “Sure wish we 
could get him back from wherever 
he went.” 

This time during the rush of the 
rewinding roll, the old man saw 
that a tiny light he had installed in 
the barograph case was now glow- 
ing. This signalled a statistically- 
significant one-percent loss in at- 



Ring Shot

mospheric pressure. Was the wind 
rising? It was hard to tell with the 
curtains drawn. He took a deep, 
involuntary breath. 

Amy was now jumping up and 
down and clapping her hands in 
complete excitement over the 
player piano. “What does ‘trip the 
light fantastic on the sidewalks of 
New York’ mean, Uncle Phil?” she 
cried in dehght at him. 

''That” said the old man, rising 
briskly from the piano stool and 
pointing a finger at her head, “is 
exactly what you are now going to 
discover, Amy.” As the music 
began, the old man bowed low be- 
fore the little girl and took her right 
hand in his left. “May I have this 
dance, my lady? he said grinning 
down at her. 

Amy immediately and solemnly 
curtsied, then grirmed back at him. 
“Yes, but you’ll have to show me 
how,” she said. 

“This is Harlem Strut, written 
by James P. Johnson and played 
in this very room for your ei\joy- 
ment by the composer,” said Hos- 
kins cocking his head at Amy. “So, 
you must strut. Just so Amy. .” and 
off he went, kicking, strutting and 
posturing around the table and 
drawing Amy with him by the hand, 
but she soon understood the sim- 
ple, rhythmic steps and danced 
lightly beside him, kicking and 
shaking with bursts of laughter. 

Around they went, the piano 
tinkling brightly, Amy now fully 
mimicking the old man’s elaborate, 
strutting steps as he shouted, “Fin- 
gers, Amy, snap ‘em! Shoulders, 
shake ‘em! Come on, you two! Amy 



and I are showing you how to do 
the thing. No time for shyness 
now!” 

So David and Peggy started to 
follow them around, feet tenta- 
tively kicking out, fingers starting 
to snap. “That’s it!” said Hoskins 
beaming at them from across the 
table. “If Mozart had lived in the 
Bronx, he would have written /far- 
lem Strut! Back straight, Amy! 
Knees and ankles floppy! Wonder- 
ful, wonderful . !” 

Behind them on the piano the 
line on the barograph was now vis- 
ibly turning downwards and a sec- 
ond and then a third light were 
glowing inside the instrument 
case, but the two couples now paid 
no attention, strutting, swaying 
and grinning. When Amy momen- 
tarily pressed her left hand against 
her ear and said, “My ears feel 
funny. Uncle Phil,” he only strode 
ever-more-stiffly and kicked with 
ever-greater exuberance. 

“Ears are for listening to Harlem 
Strut, Amy! Snap those fingers, 
young lady!” 

And as the tune neared its end, 
the tempo began to slow a bit as 
the pneumatic system of the player 
piano progressively failed to keep 
pace with the accelerating de- 
crease in room pressure, but they 
still danced gaily, swaying and 
strutting around the room. 

“Perfect! Super! Unbelieavable!” 
came the glad cries of a young man 
who dashed into the room and 
jerked a set of headphones off his 
ears while waving a compact 
super- 16 minicam at them. He 
whirled to gesture wildly at the

IF 




other doorways. “Weren’t they 
great! Hey, Pol, I mean, wasn’t that 
something else\” 

A slim, pretty young woman sit- 
ting behind a portable light-control 
switchboard set up in the kitchen 
got up while busily rubbing red, 
streaming eyes. “It sure was!” she 
snuffled as she pulled off her own 
headset, then got up and walked 
into the main room. “Boy, you guys 
really had me going. Oh, wow!” 

She went over and tearily hug- 
ged Peggy. “When you broke up in 
that silent scream as Amy came 
out of that room with the doll in 
her hands . that was like heart- 
rending, you know?” 

Peggy hugged her back and 
wiped her own tears away. “Yeah, 
I really got into that story. 
Well . when it’s your own kid it 
makes it easy. And Amy was so 
great ...” Peggy wiped away 
another tear and patted her hus- 
band’s shoulder with a loving ges- 
ture. 

The young film director had 
dropped to his knees and seized 
both of Amy’s hands. “You were 
just totally super, Amy!” he said to 
her. “The way you picked up on 
that dancing, watching the Prof, 
getting into it. Ohhh, it was soooo 
goodr 

Amy beamed delightedly at him. 
“I loved the dancing part,” she said 
positively. “I’m going to be a 
dancer when I grow up, you 
know?” 

“Sweetie,” said the young man 
passionately, “this film will kick 
you off into a great career.” He 
stood up and waved his hand at 



two more young men and another 
young woman who had come in to 
the room through the other door- 
ways. “We’ve got a winner! I know 
it. Absolutely!” He turned to David, 
Peggy and the old man. “Wow, am 
I glad I got you people out of that 
extension acting class instead of 
using some undergrad acting 
majors from the campus. This film 
unit is one of ten in the U.S. al- 
ready. If our movie makes the first 
three in that contest, it goes on na- 
tional prime time. And . .” he said, 
swiveling and grinning at them all, 
“arty, serious shorts are coming 
back in a big way in movie theatres. 
Hey, we’re all going to be rich and 
famous!” 

On that cheerful note the stu- 
dent film crew packed up the 
cameras, lights, and other gear and 
began to load everything into two 
vans parked outside the house. As 
he pulled on his hunting coat, 
David Bidwell gave the old man a 
slightly-guilty smile. “Uh, Phil,” he 
said, “you wouldn’t have any gas 
in cans, would you? We ran out on 
the south access road and hiked 
in. Danrm gauge is busted.” 

“Why sure,” said Hoskins, then 
turned to the young lighting 
woman coiling her cables. “Hey, 
Polly, there’s a two gallon can of 
unleaded in the far shed. Drive 
these folks in your van down to 
the south access road and stay 
with them until they get their car 
going, okay? Take off the air 
cleaner and pour a little into the 
carburetor before you crank it,” he 
said to David. 

The Bidwells and the film stu-

dents went out of the house talking 
cheerfully to load the large van, 
then went rumbling off over the 
open ground to the south. The 
unit’s director had seemed to be 
in no rush to follow the rest of his 
crew, and now he stood at the front 
door to the big central room, look- 
ing across at the old man, his intent 
face seeming puzzled, almost con- 
cerned. “Doc,” he said, “you were 
almost too good in that thing, you 
know? You really caught me by the 
throat. I mean, the way you kept 
kicking and strutting, so loose and 
happy, drawing Amy along. But 
your face just got firmer, more 
rigid; that tight, almost-mad 
smile . hey, you defined that mo- 
ment totally, all that joy, terror, 
hope, death, the whole bit, man!” 
Hoskins smiled and nodded. 
“You’re kind to say that. It was fun 
doing it, but I guess it was wrench- 
ing too. I was as caught up in that 
story as anyone. And . .” he 
paused, then shrugged as though 
suddenly catching an afterthought, 
“it worked, didn’t it? Here we are, 
safe and sound.” 

The startled director, bewil- 
dered by this strange comment, bit 
his lip then shook his head with a 
small, embarrassed frown. 

“Well yeh, but, I mean, there 
wasn’t ever any doubt, was there 
Doc? It was just a short film. You 
know, we had a script . .” 

The young man paused, then 
said seriously, “Doc, you don’t 
think they might ever be able to 
do something crazy like that, do 
you? Like that ring shot, I mejm?” 
Hoskins shook his head. 

86 IF 



“They’ve been trying for over fifty 
years, ever since World War Two. 
Good grief, they’ve spent more 
money on splitting atoms than on 
the space race. Understand, study- 
ing the atomic nucleus isn’t my 
physics thing, but apparently 
there’s just no way to get what they 
call the multiplication factor in an 
atomic reacting system beyond 
unity, so you can make more parti- 
cles than you use up. Old Fermi 
thought he had it solved when he 
built a system at Stagg Field, in 
Chicago, but the thing wouldn’t 
work then and they don’t work 
now. They still aren’t sure why, but 
it has something to do with chang- 
ing probabilities of fission events 
as that magic number, one, is ap- 
proached.” 

The student director nodded and 
rubbed his cheek. “Thank the Lord 
for that,” he said fervently. “After 
doing this story today, oh wow, I 
mean nobody needs ring shots!” 

But Hoskins’s old face had 
grown sober in apparent deep 
thought. “Still,” he said with a 
spurious intensity as he saw how 
thoroughly his young friend had 
been drawn into their short, in- 
tense dramatic effort, “the sudden 
removal of the atmosphere raises 
an array of interesting questions. 
You see, the seas will boil as the 
pressure drops, with the tropics 
starting first since the vapor pres- 
sure is high over the warmer water. 
Yet that sudden cloud cover wiU 
prevent the sunhght from warming 
the surface so there will be an im- 
mediate and drastic depression of 
solar insolation and surface tern- 




perature. So you’re going to wind 
up with steam and ice, but ... in 
what proportion? Or maybe all of 
one or all of the other . .?” 

He had now taken on his lectur- 
ing tones and was looking mus- 
ingly over at his smaU computer 
system with its keyboard, TV 
monitor, and disc drives spread 
about. “Interesting problem, actu- 
ally. Quite challenging . .” 

But the old man’s clever acting 
spoof had drawn in the young man 
completely. “Doc,” he said, almost 
in tears, “no, no! Don’t mess with 
that stuff. Hey, don’t use that thing 
on the table to do those numbers! 
You and Amy dancing, that’s the 
only way to deal with weird, 
crazy, horror stuff! You’ve done 
it. Doc . beautifully . don’t, 
don’t . .!” 

Hoskins stepped forward and 
clapped the young director on the 
shoulder. “You’re absolutely right,” 
he said in a laughing voice. “Also,” 
he added, waving toward his com- 
puting system, “I have a date to- 
night with a Pac Man Nine 
disc . you can gobble ghosts 
throughout N dimensions.” 

The young man, finally realizing 
that the old professor had sucked 
him almost effortlessly into their 
holocaust fantasy once again, 
shook his head ruefully. “Wow, you 
should have done this acting stuff 
instead of physics. Doc.” He 
paused, then looked over at the 
piano. “Listen, can I take that 
barograph for a couple of days? I 
want to cut away from you and 
Amy dancing to the graph paper 
on that thing and end the film with 



that line going right down towards 
zero.” He wEilked across the room 
to lift the instrument off the player 
piano. 

“What about the visual back- 
ground behind the barograph?” 
asked Hoskins as they walked out 
the front door. 

The director shrugged. “No 
problem. 1 want to go in tight on 
the chart, then show the pen drop- 
ping steadily and quickly, maybe a 
twenty-second shot in all. I might 
iris down on the pen and fade the 
light too. 

The old man nodded. “Okay, I’ll 
ride over to the school tomorrow 
and give you a hand with that. We 
can disconnect the arm inside 
there and move the pen by hand 
while you shoot. What about the 
sound while the barograph goes to 
hell in a hack?” 

The student slammed the door 
of his van and grinned out the win- 
dow at the old man. “Just more of 
Harlem Strut from your tinny, out- 
of-tune player piano, doc, maybe 
going slower and slower. I mean, 
after that dance with Amy, what 
elseT He gave a big wave and 
roared the engine. “See you tomor- 
row,” he cried as the van backed 
away. 

Professor Hoskins waved in re- 
turn, then turned to go back into 
his retirement house deep in the 
woods of Rhode Island. As he en- 
tered the big, central room, he saw 
at once the small, china figure of 
a shepherdess sitting on top of the 
silent player piano. 

He walked to the piano corner, 
bowed, and said quietly, “Marie,

our dance I think,” then fitted Har- snapping, posturing dance around 
lem Strut again onto the pick-up his center table, humming and mut- 

roll. When the bright, unremit- tering to himself, while on his 

tingly-cheerful music started, he round old face could now be seen 
lifted the china shepherdess firmly an extraordinarily happy expres- 
but gently in his closed left hand sion of complete and total 
and set off in a strutting, finger- satisfaction.

Under Gaming 

by Stefan Jones 



Welcome to the first installment of 
Under Gaming, a column about gam- 
ing which will be appearing with some 
regularity in IF. The title comes from 
my dissatisfaction with the “other” SF 
magazine gaming columns. Mere de- 
scriptions and light-weight reviews of 
an odd game or two do not do justice 
to the genre. I will try to delve a bit 
deeper, perhaps getting a bit 
philosophical and probably a bit arrog- 
ant and curmudgeony. I’U begin with 
a rough history of gaming, as a prelude 
to where I think the genre is going. 

Over ten years ago, SF magazines 
began carrying ads for an unusual 
breed of game: military simulations. 
Though they were largely set in histor- 
ical times (with World War II and the 
Napoleonic Wars the seeming favor- 
ites), some of these games had a sci- 
ence fictional theme. Boardgames all, 
these simulations tended to be grand, 
strategic exercises. They attracted a 
small but enthusiastic group of fans 
who held their own conventions, but 
had little crossover with the SFannish 
mainstream . 

Little crossover, that is, until two 
games changed the entire gaming in- 



dustry. The first was produced by 
Metagaming Concepts, the first game 
company to concentrate solely on 
SF&F themes. The game, released in 
1979, was Ogre, a tiny “Microgame” 
that was easy to learn and play. Ogre 
set the stage for an explosion of sci- 
ence fiction and fantasy game titles, 
many of which were far easier to learn 
then the heavy simulations of the past. 

The second revolutionary game was, 
of course. Dungeons & Dragons. It 
was the first commercially produced 
role-playing game. Instead of taking 
the rather abstract role as a leader of 
vast armies, each player took control 
of a single, highly-detailed “character,” 
a fictional person described by numer- 
ical representations of a series of attri- 
butes (intelligence, combat ability), 
etc.). The concept, if not totally origi- 
nal, had come of age in D&D. Clones, 
supplements, new games, and playing 
aids burst the sluice gate; within eight 
years D&D became a household word 
and had its own Saturday morning car- 
toon. Dozens of other games are avail- 
able on subjects ranging from rabbits 
to time travel to post-holocaust sur- 
vivalism. 

Nearly every gamer I know also 

Under Gaming 89 




reads SF and fantasy. Nearly every fan 
I know has tried role-playing and other 
types of games. Many science fiction 
authors have participated in gaming 
projects, ranging from tie-ins to popu- 
lar books (Ringworld, Thieves' World, 
etc.) to games designed by authors 
themselves. Gaming suites, and even 
organized gaming, seem mandatory at 
SF cons. 

But . how “legitimate” is the grim- 
ing genre? Is running a game the same 
as writing a novel? Should there be, as 
suggested by an article in the first issue 
of The Space Gamer over a decade 
ago, a Hugo Award for games? Though 
gaming is one of my favorite hobbies 
and designing gaming material a re- 
munerative sideline, I can’t imagine a 
gaming Hugo . yet. 

One type of gaming, the board game, 
has no literary pretensions. Board 
games simulate battles, economic con- 
flicts, and occasionally the rise and fall 
of galactic empires. Their story is told 
by numbers and distribution of units, 
stockpiles of resources, and occa- 
sional elaborations such as morale 
levels. They are abstract and cool, and 
require more intellectual effort to learn 
and play. Board games, even the SF&F 
brands, have fallen on hard times 
lately. Kids raised on video games 
don’t have the patience to learn them. 
They head for the RPGs (Role Playing 
Games) without giving board games a 
second thought; thus we move to the 
hottest part of gaming today. 

To be blunt, the vast majority of role- 
playing games are crap. The fantasy 
universes (with notable exceptions 
such as M A.R. Barker’s “Tekumel” and 
Greg Stafford’s “Glorantha”) of FRP 
(Fantasy Role Playing) games are 
often rehashes of Tolkien with liberal 
doses of oriental mythology and cutesy 
fannish aliens thrown in. Science fic- 
tion campaigns are almost always set 



in a “sci fi” universe of galactic em- 
pires, space mercenaries, and starship 
traders. Modern sophistication in 
these games is having a giant megacor- 
poration be the enemy rather than an 
alien horde. Many game masters (the 
fellows who run the adventure and de- 
termine the behavior of background 
characters) are convinced that the 
only way to play is to purchase “mod- 
ules” (pre-planned adventures) and 
adopt every new character class and 
monster that surfaces in gaming 
periodicals. Individual creativity is ex- 
changed for a consumer mentality. 

Because it is the players — this in- 
cludes the all-important GM (Game 
Master) as well as the ordinary folk 
running the protagonists in a game ad- 
venture — who bring a game to life, 
who make an adventure what it is, it 
is they who are the true indicators of 
the state of the art of gaming. If Hugos 
were to be given for gaming, it could 
be argued that players would be the 
nominees. Alas, the players too seem 
to lack spunk. Characters are modeled 
after stereotypical space mercenaries, 
barbarian warriors, and wizards. Heck! 
Many players consider their characters 
to be little more than units — for all 
intents and purposes, they are playing 
a win-or-lose wargame. The attitude 
most players have in these games — 
and therefore the nature of game ad- 
ventures — can be described, quite sim- 
ply, as juvenile. The A-Team and 
Japanese cartoons about robots that 
turn into dump trucks are often more 
sophisticated. 

Whoa there! Calm down, fella. 
(Sound of a forehead cracking against 
the document ledge of a PC keyboard.) 
Ah, that feels better. Though I am often 
disgusted with the state of gaming, its 
true purpose (thrills, fun, and — in the 
case of role-playing — an emotional es- 
cape valve), must not be subverted to 



90 



IF 




literary pretensions. A gaming Hugo 
would only confuse the situation. 

Though conventional gaming will be 
around for some time, I can see it being 
overtaken as the “leading edge” of 
gaming by a strange newcomer — the 
computer game. I DON’T mean “video” 
or “arcade” games when I say com- 
puter games. Arcade games made and 
killed the home computer market a 
few years ago. They are light entertain- 
ment, the electronic equivalent of pick- 
ing at scabs or popping the little bub- 
bles in plastic packing sheets. The 
computer games with real potential 
are best represented by titles such as 
The Seven Cities of Gold, Mule and 
Balance of Power. They are deep 
games. 

Deep computer games have a lot to 
them. A lot of detail, a lot of playability, 
a lot of options. They use the power 
of the computer to give the illusion of 
the “endlessness” that makes role play- 
ing games so appealing. An example: 
the New World generation system in 
The Seven Cities of Gold. This is a 
nifty exploration game: the player 
plays a Columbus or Magellan-like 
character charting and exploiting the 
Western Hemisphere. The flipside of 
the game disk is equipped with a com- 
puterized map of North America. Ter- 
rain, native villages (including Inca and 
Aztec cities) and special features (gold 
mines, the Grand Canyon, etc.) are all 
laid out in nice graphic form. When 
the adventurer has “played out” the 
real Western Hemisphere ... he can 
make a new one. A sophisticated con- 
tinent generation program is included 
with the game. Though random num- 
bers determine the exact layout of the 
lands beyond the Atlantic, various 
rules keep things logical. Mountains 
come in chains, villages appear on 
river banks, and the river systems run 



from mountain to the sea and not vice 
versa. The world thus created is logical 
and consistent. Because the player’s 
job is to explore it without running out 
of food or getting lost, it has “meaning” 
to the player, rather than being a chunk 
of random real estate. 

Given the speed, graphic power, and 
huge memories of the new breeds of 
game computer (the Amiga and Atari 
ST computers), we can look forward 
to some really great stuff in the future. 
Imagine a world and civilization 
generator. Given sufficient elements 
that can be varied, plus good rules to 
eliminate silly results, very “real” 
worlds and aliens could be created. 
Such worlds could change with time: 
seasons would cycle, civilizations wax 
and wane, governments bubble with 
intrigue. One would create the world, 
set up the rules, and start the clock. 

Another important part of a good 
game is interactivity. I suppose the ul- 
timate in this is the ability to “talk” 
with game characters. Though we can’t 
expect a mere game to pass the Turing 
test, making conversation a useful, en- 
joyable part of a games is quite possi- 
ble. Giving each character in a game 
a personality via an Eliza-^e program 
(Eliza is a program that simulates a 
psychiatrist; it picks key words out of 
inputted sentences and uses them in 
replies — ^the “counseling session” thus 
simulated can be unnervingly realistic) 
is quite possible. 

One more element that has to be 
added to computer games to make 
them competitive with conventional 
role playing is to make them multi- 
player. This is difficult. Home com- 
puters are essentiaUy one-user de- 
vices. There is, however, a model we 
could imitate to solve this problem. 
This will be the topic of my next col- 
umn.

Although I’m dating this entry

My name is Richard Treskitte. I

passed out immediately. I woke up 
on their ship, which looked like the 
inside of an Earth space capsule 
but bigger. One of the aliens told 




exhibit. This might be a zoo. Maybe 
not. The planet’s name sounds like 
Marchplateau in their language, a 
language which isn’t much differ- 
ent in sound, syntax, and grammar 
from my own. This place could be 
a museum, I guess. Maybe I’ll soon 
be pickled in some odorous liquid. 

Marchplateauians came down to 
Earth in a spaceship. To the roof 
of my building, actually. There was 
a bunch of people on a nearby roof 



me in accented English that they 
were taking me to their home 
planet and I shouldn’t worry. I 
asked why they’d kidnapped me. I 
was just an ordinary guy, why me? 
I said. He just ran a spaceship, he 
said, don’t ask him. 

So they brought me to this lux- 
ury cage. I think I’m being studied. 
Observed, at least. A lot of March- 
plateauians pass by and through 
my cage. None of them tell me any- 

Marchplateau 93 



thing about why I’m here. I can’t 
figure out what they’re looking for. 
I’m exactly like them. They’re like 
me. FYank, apparently my keeper, 
or chief scholar, is a good deal like 
me. 

They look human. Faces ar- 
ranged the same way as Earth- 
people’s. Ditto bodies. I can see no 
difference between a March- 
plateauman and an Earthman. A 
Marchplateauwoman and an 
Earthwoman. They have woman’s 
liberation here, too, so I have to 
be careful about nomenclature. 
Marchplateauperson? 

Marchplateau itself looks an 
awful lot like Earth. Overcrowded 
cities, pollution. Jeans. Even de- 
signer jeans, though with different 
names sewed or appliqued on their 
pockets. Bad plays on their Broad- 
way, the usual movies. Cars. Trees, 
TV. Prepackaged foods, fast-food 
chains. How could fast-food chains 
develop independently on two dif- 
ferent planets? A heavy question. 
They got junk mail. No cock- 
roaches, though. Haven’t seen any 
cockroaches. 

What differences there are, don’t 
amount to much. 

I’d like to get away. Escape. I’m 
lonely. I’d like companionship. I’d 
like a woman. I’d like to figure out 
how you organize a journal. 

Day 2 

A Marchplateau tailor measured 
me for a suit today. He wrote each 
of my measurements down in a 
notebook with dogeared pages. 
After, he chewed on a pencil and 
stared at me. 



“What’d you learn about me?” I 
said, thinking he, like all my other 
captors, was studying me. 

“What’s new to learn? I’m a 
tailor. They told me to fit you for 
a suit. What you’re wearing now, 
small wonder.” 

Day 3 

My new suit is brown, made of 
a soft material between velvet and 
chamois. Lapels and pocket linings 
are darker than the body of the 
suit. There are epaulets on the 
jacket shoulder. Like the Mao 
jacket that came and went so 
quickly years ago. Maybe there was 
a Marchplateau Mao. 

Frank told me to wear the suit 
when I have visitors. Anytime else 
I can select fi'om my own ward- 
robe. I always sleep in the nude, 
which I hope annoys some of them. 

Day 4 

The suit makes me look more 
like them. They all, men and 
women, have epaulets on the 
shoulders of their clothing. Not 
just jackets and suitcoats. Dresses, 
shirts, and blouses, too. And rain- 
coats, but then they belong on rain- 
coats. Before they gave me my own 
suit, I didn’t notice their epaulets. 
Unless my new suit has set a new 
style. 

Some of my visitors stare at me 
through rectangular glass parti- 
tions all along the walls of my cage. 
Other visitors enter my cage and 
give me close-up onceovers. A few 
write stuff down on papers at- 
tached to clipboards. But most of 
them are just sightseeing, I guess.

IF 




Anything gives these clowns a 
thrill. Using the toilet in the corner 
of the cage makes the outside 
peeping toms laugh and cheer. I’ve 
gotten to like it, even expect it. I 
wonder if Marchplateau toilets are 
always in living room corners, if 
Marchplateau families applaud 
when one of their number uses it. 
They must get a lot of laughs from 
Pampers. 

I just realized — that’s where 
prisons keep their toilets, in the 
corners of cells. Don’t like thinking 
of that. 

FYank always sails in here carry- 
ing a clipboard, just like the more 
scholarly of my visitors. On him, 
though, it looks like a weapon. He’s 
my most frequent visitor. I doubt 
he’s really named Frank. I think 
the Earthstyle names on Frank and 
some of the others are meant to 
make me feel comfortable. Frank 
is tall and rugged-looking but 
something of a sophisticate, the 
sort of intellectual who camps out 
or climbs the occasional mountain. 

“You people enjoy studying me?” 
I asked him today. 

“Some of us. Others don’t. They 
feel we should be studying an out- 
standing representative of your 
race, culture, and species. A leader 
or an achiever.” 

“You really know how to hurt a 
guy, Frank.” 

He looked pleased by that re- 
mark. He wrote it down on his clip- 
board paper. 

Later he told me he was working 
against the termination of the 
study. The word termination stuck 
in my throat like a clump of food. 



I applied the Heimlich maneuver 
to my fear and asked what were 
the odds that the study would be 
terminated and, if terminated, 
would the subject of the study also 
be terminated. He said he didn’t 
know. It was all based on finances 
and diverted funds. 

He won’t tell me the purpose of 
the study. Perhaps Marchplateau 
wants to invade Earth or maybe 
they’re just doing an objective 
analysis of alien life. But how could 
their findings be fruitful? It’d be 
just like analyzing themselves. 

Day 5 

This journal’s beginning to look 
like the work of a madman. Diary 
of a Madman by Guy de Treskitte. 
Anybody reading this might be 
thinking I’m just a loony in an 
Earthbound snake pit. Not so, 
Potso. I am real. Marchplateau is 
real. Even Earth is real. I was really 
abducted by aliens. I’ve probably 
been listed in the missing-persons 
column of the Sunday Daily News. 
I am really living in a luxury cage. 
With a real toilet in the corner, the 
force of whose flushing could 
power Indianapolis overnight. I 
even have my own TV set. There’s 
more violence on Marchplateau 
TV. Makes it more watchable. 

I’m not insane. Up till now my 
life’s been disgustingly normal. 
Well, I was over thirty and unmar- 
ried, but that’s hardly deviant now- 
adays. For God’s sake, I was an 
accountant! 

Day 6 

Now there’s a woman in my cage 

Marchplateau 95 




with me. What are they up to? She 
says her name is Daisy. She too 
was abducted from Earth. She 
says. They’ve been keeping her in 
a separate cage. She says. 

Seems like a setup. I don’t mind, 
though. She’s terrific in bed, so 
should I complain? We had a swell 
time last night. I didn’t even mind 
the Marchplateauians outside the 
window laughing and cheering. 

Still, I’m not sure she’s really an 
Earthwoman. Her “memories” of 
Earth seem convincing, and her 
English pronunciations are quite 
good. But then, so are those of the 
Marchplateaupeople. 

“It’s only logical to think I’m one 
of them,” she said this morning 
after I expressed my doubts. “A 
ringer. I’m not sure about you 
either, buster. But, look here. I’ve 
been too lonely to care about such 
technicalities.” 

“If you’re a ringer, maybe they’re 
trying to gain further control over 
me.” 

“Why would they want more 
control? They got enough already.” 
“Maybe you’re a Marchplateau 
spy.” 

“But I’m not. Heck, buster. I’m a 
social worker ft'om Pittsburgh. 
Why would they want to play such 
complicated tricks on a social 
worker and an accountant?” 

“You know, you’re fairly sensi- 
ble. For a ringer.” 

“So are you, ringer. So let’s 
forget that sort of crap.” 

But I can’t forget it. I want to 
know if she’s a ringer. On the other 
hand, she does have a long, slim 
body and she wears her blouses 



tantalizingly open, and she has a 
pretty enough face with a bit too 
much chin, but who cares about 
chin when you got love? 

Day 7 

FYank was surprised that Daisy 
and I had so many doubts about 
each other. No tricks were being 
pulled, he said, it was merely 
worthwhile to the study to bring 
us together. We are both Earth- 
people, he vowed. We said we 
didn’t know how we could possibly 
believe him. 

“Well, how about clues?” he said. 
“Any clues you can use to identify 
yourselves to each other — things 
we Marchplateauians couldn’t pos- 
sibly know, for instance.” 

“I don’t know what you know or 
don’t know,” I said. 

“Then accept each other on 
faith.” 

“Don’t know about that, but I’m 
willing to continue the arrange- 
ment until I’m sure.” 

“Am I just a convenience to you 
then, Richard?” Daisy said. The 
odor of feminism was heavy in the 
air, so I replied: “No, no, Daisy, it’s 
not that at all.” 

“Okay if it is. I’ll bide my time. 
Or fall in love with a March- 
plateauian. Frank’s cute.” 

“I’m taken.” 

“The cute taU ones always are. 
You know, Frank, the one thing 
that really bugs me about Richard 
is his name. Richard Treskitte. I 
keep wanting to get myself some 
soft French cheese and spread it 
all over him.” 

“It’s a legitimate name,” I said. 



96 



IF 




defensively. 

“So you say. At least Daisy Mar- 
tin has a solid Earth ring to it.” 
‘Too solid, too American pie. 
The right ring for a ringer. Just the 
sort of alias a Marchplateauian 
would dream up. My name’d take 
too much imagination.” 

“We have a high degree of imag- 
ination,” Frank said. “We could 
easily invent imaginative names.” 
“But why?” Daisy ^aid. “Why be 
too good? That’d be a dead give- 
away.” 

“You are both authentic,” Frank 
said. “Believe me, please.” 

“Methinks the lad protests too 
much,” I said. 

“A misquoting of Shakespeare,” 
Frank said. 

“You know Shakespeare? Maybe 
you’re the earthling,” Daisy said. 

“No, we’re reading Shakespeare 
these days. A volume of the bard’s 
work was appropriated on our 
most recent trip to Earth. Our first 
printing of the tragedies is a 
number-one best-seller now. Such 
wonderful stuff! The language, so 
rich and melodic, not at all like 
what you two speak.” 

“That’s a mean-spirited thing to 
say, Frank,” I said. 

“I thought it might look good in 
your journal, Richard.” 

I wanted to give up right then.. 
What good is keeping a Journal if 
they’re going to read it? Are you 
with me on that, Frank? 

Day 8 

I wasn’t going to write anything 
more in the journal, then I realized 
it might be the only record of me 



left. It’d preserve me. I want to be 
preserved. Even in formaldehyde, 
Frank? That would seem to be your 
kind of joke. Whoever reads to the 
end of this sentence will be con- 
sumed in instant flames, if he is 
Frank. All others may proceed. 

I told Daisy today I was fond of 
her. She strolled around the cage, 
examining furniture, vnthout re- 
plying. She touched my genuine 
leather reading chair. I felt uneasy. 
I knew she realized it was my 
chair. 

“I had a chair like this in my cage, 
too. It had cigarette holes in its 
arm. I miss it. I’m glad you’re fond 
of me, Richard.” 

“I think I’m in love with you.” 
“You know, your whole decor’s 
better than they stuck me with. 
Chauvinist Marchplateauian pigs. 
This is a cheerful cage. Even your 
TV reception’s better. Mine was — ” 
“Daisy, I said I’m in love with 
you.” 

“I heard you. You want me to 
respond in kind. Okay, Richard 
Treskitte (you sure about the 
name?), I love you too.” 

I rushed to her, intending an em- 
brace. 

“Daisy, I’m so — ” 

“One thing. The truth. I’m not an 
Earthwoman. You were right. I’m 
a Marchplateau spy.” 

I recoiled from her, lost all desire 
to touch her. She laughed. A lot of 
scorn in that laugh. 

“You fell out of love real quick 
there, Richard. No, I’m not a spy 
and not a native and now let’s talk 
about splitting the housekeeping 
duties. Also, I want you to look 



Marchplateau 



97 




away when I use the toilet.” 

“You let all those creeps out 
there watch you.” 

“Can’t do anything about them. 
It’s scientific for them. For you it’s 
voyeurism.” 

Our viewers outside the glass 
were staring at us with peculiar in- 
terest. I think they suspected a 
fight brewing. I sulked instead. I 
think they er\joyed that just as well. 

Maybe Daisy was right. Maybe I 
was just faking the love. I don’t 
know. If I’m not in love with her 
now, I think I could eventually fall 
for her. What do you think, Frank? 

Day 9 

The English language is sweep- 
ing Marchplateau, Frank says. It’s 
become a second language for 
most citizens. He said that March- 
plateauians tend to top off quickly 
on fads and that this’d pass. Maybe 
I’m a fad that’U soon pass. I must 
escape. You didn’t read that, Frank. 

Day 10 

I escaped. We escaped. 

I found the key to the cage in 
my suit pocket. Maybe Frank, read- 
ing yesterday’s entry, decided to 
slip it there. I’d say thanks, Frank, 
but that’d mean we’d been cap- 
tured again. Or that his successor 
is reading this. Successor, at the 
end of this sentence you will be 
turned into a frog. 

At first Daisy didn’t want to go. 

“It’s a setup,” she said. “They’ll 
just reel us in later.” 

“So what? Maybe we’ll outwit 
them.” 

“No way.” 

98 IF 



“Well, I don’t care if it’s a setup. 
I’m going.” 

“Me too, then. You got a good 
point there.” 

We escaped from the cage and 
the compound easily. There was 
nobody anywhere near us. 

The compound, we found out, 
was smack in the middle of a city. 
With no concept of where to go, 
we wandered the streets. People 
passing us paid little attention. We 
were dressed like them, looked 
like them. At first we stayed out of 
their way, walking along the edges 
of curbs, crossing the street when 
there were too many people on our 
side. Most of the passersby seemed 
to be speaking English. We relaxed 
a bit. 

I noticed very little difference 
between Earth and Marchplateau. 
Trees were trees, buildings were 
architecturally the same, side- 
walks were bright green but were 
made out of cement. I saw several 
five-wheeled cars but they could 
have been Japanese. 

In a clean shopping center 
where all of the stores had brown 
awnings, we found a glitzy store 
devoted to Earth objects. Its win- 
dow display seemed kind of ran- 
dom. Toward the front of the win- 
dow was a pile of A1 Jolson re- 
cords. Then, of course, a selection 
of Shakespearean plays, plus a 
Marchplateauian interpretation of 
his works. There was a bunch of 
jewelled and nonjewelled barettes, 
the center one showing a flat plas- 
tic smiling dog. Pictures of Lillie 
Langtry, colored by hand. Vid- 
eocassettes of kung fu movies. A 




lot of other items I can’t now recall. 

“There don’t seem to be any elec- 
tronic games,” Daisy commented. 

“Maybe they forgot to steal bat- 
teries.” 

We discovered you could ride in 
Marchplateau buses without pay- 
ing. Since our feet were aching, we 
took a few joyrides. We rode by 
many signs, stores, and objects 
that were obviously influenced by 
their thefts of Earth culture. I won- 
dered if some of the Earth items 
derived from their study of Daisy 
and me. I hoped so. 

As we got off a bus, a group of 
people surrounded us and 
suggested we come with them. We 
thought we were caught for sure, 
but the people turned out to be 
dissidents who had recognized us. 
They took us to an apartment 
where we could stay the night. I 
was glad of that, I couldn’t have 
rode or walked much more. They 
said the apartment was safe for 
only a day and we’d have to be on 
our own again after that. They said 
a massive search for us had been 
launched. They apologized for not 
being more helpful. I told them 
they’d been quite helpful. 

The fed us well, just like back 
at the compound. Everybody on 
Marchplateau seems concerned 
that we eat well. They tried to ex- 
plain their politics, but I was too 
tired to comprehend and not very 
interested anyway. Earth politics, 
Marchplateau politics, all the same 
to me. 

They left us alone in a bedroom. 
Daisy fell asleep and I’ve been writ- 
ing in the journal ever since. I’m 



in a quandary. I can’t tell if Daisy 
is a real Earth woman, if 
Marchplateau’s a setup. I only 
know who I am. I want to know 
more than that. Knowing who you 
are’s not enough. You have to 
know someone else. I don’t like 
being disturbed like this. These 
guys have screwed me up good. 
Even if I get back to Earth I’m not 
going to be the same guy I was. 
I’m going to think a lot about my 
experiences here. I’m going to 
think a lot of what a creep I’ve 
been, trusting in everything I saw, 
believing everything was real and 
somehow worthwhile so long as I 
accepted it. Now, even if I accept 
such things, I won’t know if they’re 
real. Worse, if they’re real, I won’t 
know whether or not to accept 
them. I’m really tired, I guess, to 
be worrying about stuff like this. I 
almost hope you’re reading this, 
Frank, even though I devoutly 
hope you explode when you finish 
this sentence. 

Day 11 

The dissidents took us to a 
downtown spot and dropped us 
off. Their vehicle was a kind of van, 
again with five wheels. They acted 
strangely, whispered a lot to each 
other. I thought I heard the word 
sabotage a couple of times. When 
they said goodbye, they also said 
they were sorry they couldn’t do 
more for us. Daisy asked if we 
could join them. Three of them 
answered no very quickly. 

“I want to touch something and 
know what I’m touching is real,” 
Daisy said after we’d walked for a 



Marchplateau 



99 




while. 

“I know what you mean. It’d 
even be nice to feel pain.” 

“I don’t want to go that far, 
lover.” 

We walked around the city like 
sightseers on the last day of their 
trip, too bleary-eyed to be as in- 
terested as they feel they should 
be. Nobody in the streets paid us 
much attention. At midday we had 
lunch, having found out from our 
rescuers that restaurants in the 
city were subsidized by the govern- 
ment for the convenience of the 
citizens, and that lunches were 
free. Halfway through a rather 
good meal I realized that perhaps 
the essential difference between 
Earth and Marchplateau was that 
on Marchplateau there is such a 
thing as a free lunch. 

After some aimless post-lunch 
strolling, we turned a corner onto 
what appeared to be a darker 
street. It was a moment before I 
realized that the darkness was 
caused by the smoke clogging the 
street ahead of us. People scurried 
left and right, emerging from the 
smokescreen like apparitions. 
Daisy and I broke into a run, glad 
to have something to investigate. 
A few steps later we discovered 
that the smoke was coming from 
the windows of a burning building. 

“What is it? What’s happening?” 
I hollered to a passerby. 

“It’s the orphanage. The orphan- 
age’s on fire. The children, they’re 
trapped. It’s awful.” 

“Where’s the fire department?” 
“I don’t know. I heard — heard 
there’s been a terrible crash on the 



boulevard. A pileup. Several fire- 
trucks involved. Some say sabot- 
age. But I don’t know.” 

I thought of our dissidents and 
wondered if setting fire to an or- 
phanage was their idea of a good 
protest. 

“Why are you running away?” I 
grabbed the man’s arm to keep him 
from running further up the street. 
“Why isn’t anybody doing any- 
thing? Why is everybody running 
away?” 

“Let me go. I don’t want to die.” 

“You’re out here, not in there. 
What are you afraid of?” 

“The orphanage, it’s built — the 
building next to it, that’s the mun- 
itions works, the explosives fac- 
tory. It could go up any minute. Let 
me go.” 

I let him go. Like almost all the 
people around us, he scampered 
to some safe place. 

Thicker smoke was now pouring 
out of the orphanage’s windows. 
Flames licked at the buildings on 
both sides of it. There was no sign 
indicating which of these buildings 
was the explosives factory. I could 
hear the children’s faint frightened 
screams. 

“Why doesn’t anybody do some- 
thing?” Daisy said. 

“They are. They’re running 
away.” 

“But the children. Listen to the 
children.” 

I knew I had to do something 
and wondered why my legs 
seemed suddendly made of lead. 

“Daisy,” I said, “get to a safe 
place. I’m going in there.” 

I didn’t wait for her response. I 



100 



IF 




started running toward the burning 
orphanage. I guess I shouldn’t have 
been surprised that Daisy ran there 
with me. I suspect she’ll always do 
the ornery thing. 

We were shoulder to shoulder 
as we pushed through the orphan- 
age’s massive front doors. Inside, 
there was a lobby presenting few 
obstacles to us. The fire was in the 
upper stories of the building. None 
of it had reached the lobby yet. A 
few wisps of smoke seeped from 
between elevator doors, crept 
down the main staircase. It all 
looked no worse that people just 
out of sight sneaking cigarettes. 

I began taking the steps of the 
main staircase three and four at a 
time. Daisy kept pace. By the sec- 
ond floor the smoke had become 
heavier and the children’s screams 
louder. 

“Can you figure out where they 
are, the children?” I screamed to 
Daisy. 

“The next floor, I think. Toward 
the front.” 

As we reached the top of the 
next staircase, flames licked at our 
ankles for the last few steps. The 
third floor corridor was night- 
marish, fire all around us. The 
edges of the hall rug were smolder- 
ing. Corridor furniture seemed de- 
corated by tiny wisps of flame. A 
landscape on the wall depicted a 
calm Marchplateauian country 
town Just as it was catching fire. 

“All the sounds seem to be com- 
ing from there,” Daisy shouted, 
pointing down the corridor. As if 
the fire had heard her, it sent new 
massive flames across the hallway. 



Daisy and I went into a running 
crouch and, holding our breaths, 
began zigzagging down the hall to- 
ward the sound of the children’s 
screams. 

We got through the main body 
of flames and into a pocket of 
clearer air. At least it was breatha- 
ble. We were near the end of the 
corridor. A window in front of us 
revealed an almost empty street 
down below, empty except for a 
small party of onlookers who 
perhaps didn’t know that the build- 
ing next door was an explosives 
factory. I wondered briefly if I 
should call out to them. Then I 
realized they were standing there 
calmly, listening to children 
scream, and I knew I really didn’t 
care whether or not they went up 
with us. 

The screams came from both 
sides of us. We simultaneously 
realized there were two groups in 
two facing rooms. I nodded toward 
one, and Daisy started toward it 
while I went to the other. I grabbed 
for the doorknob, a goldplated ob- 
ject which itself seemed to have a 
distorted miniature fire going on 
just beneath its surface. As I 
touched it, I knew a split second 
ahead that it was a stupid move. 
The metal was hot from the fire 
and it burned the three fingertips 
of mine that made contact with it. 
I quickly pulled my hand away 
from the knob. I felt the pain, I 
know, but I was able to ignore it. 
I started heaving myself against the 
door. I had no idea how one batters 
down a door with one’s shoulders, 
having seen only padded actors on 

Marchplateau 101 




the screen thrust themselves at 
what undoubtedly were plywood 
doors. This door just might have 
been made of plywood, for it gave 
before my first heave. It didn’t 
quite open but I’d nearly split it 
down the middle. 

I looked back briefly at Daisy, 
her hand wrapped in cloth, open- 
ing her door by its knob. It occur- 
red to me that I could have thought 
of that, but I had no time to change 
plans and was in fact in the middle 
of flying at the door again. It gave 
way this time and I stumbled into 
the smoke-filled room. 

Coughing, I called out to the chil- 
dren. They began screaming louder 
and I located them in a corner of 
the room, untouched as yet by the 
fire. They huddled together, like re- 
fugees in a war photograph, their 
faces smudged, their eyes teary, 
their voices horase. They were lit- 
tle kids, all of them, not a single 
one more then four or five years 
old. Quieting them down with a 
shout, I instructed them to link 
hands. They responded quickly, 
obviously used to discipline. I grab- 
bed the smallest child, a tiny girl, 
and held her in my left arm. With 
my free hand, I took the hand of 
the tallest boy and led all of them 
across the burning smoky room. 

In the hall we met with Daisy 
and her group of kids. Somehow 
we managed to get ourselves down 
the corridor, just narrowly avoid- 
ing the threatening flames, then 
raced down the stairs to the lobby 
and the street. Outside, the smoke 
had become nearly as thick as it 
had been inside the orphanage. I 



went into a choking fit from the 
lack of fresh air that I’d been anti- 
cipating in the rush downstairs. 

Herding the children in front of 
us, we ran across the street and 
found fresher air. Suddenly people 
materialized from nowhere to help 
us with the children. As we 
reached the sidewalk, there was a 
sudden clangor of bells and sirens, 
followed quickly by a long parade 
of firetrucks careening around the 
nearest corner and coming to com- 
ical silent-movie stops in front of 
the orphanage. I stared at them in- 
credulously. So did Daisy. 

“It’s almost as if they were just 
waiting there, just around the 
corner,” Daisy said angrily. 

“Would they just wait there and 
let children burn?” I asked. 

She shrugged. I didn’t want to 
think about it. Out of breath, my 
lungs aching, my legs ready to col- 
lapse from trembling, my fingers 
beginning to throb with intense 
pain where they’d been burned, I 
felt really good. After days of con- 
finement and our short time of 
fruitless wandering, after years of 
safe living before my abduction, I 
felt good. We’d acted heroically, 
Daisy and I. I’d never expected to 
act heroically. Ever. I always 
thought I’d stay inside living quar- 
ters, behind desks, in my vehicles, 
in other people’s vehicles, on pub- 
lic transportation, anywhere 
where I wouldn’t even see the 
threat of danger at a distance, 
much less participate in it. I always 
knew I wouldn’t go to war, I never 
thought I’d run into a burning 
building. I should have been like

IF 




the Marchplateauians I’d seen in 
the street. I should have been run- 
ning away. 

All of a sudden I felt frightened. 
I had really done it, hadn’t I? I 
thought. Even as I thought it, I 
noticed the children seemed to be 
disappearing, taken over by the 
suddenly-appearing adults who 
were now taking charge, who were 
taking the charge away from us. I 
hadn’t even looked closely at any 
one of the children, had no idea 
what they had looked like, cannot 
now remember a single detail of a 
young face. It was like watching 
the accomplishment itself vanish 
right in front of my eyes. 

I turned around and looked back 
at the orphanage. Streams of water 
were pouring into it from the fire- 
trucks. Firemen had the situation 
well in hand. A crowd was begin- 
ning to gather on our side of the 
street. 

“Nobody seems afraid of the 
explosives factory now,” I re- 
marked to Daisy. 

“Maybe there never was any 
danger.” 

“I’m beginning to wonder.” 

“I think we’ve been used.” 

“I know. This whole thing could 
easily have been staged. But the 
fire itself was real. I felt it.” 

“Such things can be staged, too.” 

“I suppose so.” 

A fireman came to the crowd 
and began to force the front line 
backwards. 

“The factory can still go up!” he 
shouted. “There’s still danger!” 

“You think he overheard us?” I 
asked Daisy. 



“It’s like we’re the ones he’s try- 
ing to convince.” 

“Let’s get out of here.” 

“I’ll go for that.” 

After we’d walked a few steps, 
a well-groomed pretty woman 
came up to us, said she was from 
a newspaper and had pictures of 
us as heroes and would we grant 
her an interview. Daisy told her to 
get lost. She said newspeople 
never get lost. Daisy told her to 
learn. She stayed with us a while 
longer, asking incessant questions 
to which we didn’t respond, then 
did manage to get lost. 

“But why would they stage 
something like that, even for us?” 
I said after the newswoman had 
left. 

“I haven’t a notion.” 

“Staged or not, they were placing 
children in danger.” 

“Maybe it wasn’t that dangerous. 
Maybe they weren’t children. 
Maybe none of it was real. Maybe 
they used simulacrums or holog- 
raphs with substance. Maybe the 
fire was a special effect.” 

“It burned my fingers.” 

“No, it didn’t.” 

“What do you mean? Look!” 
“Richard, the hot doorknob 
singed your skin, not the actual fire 
which, you must admit, for all its 
sound and fury, kept missing con- 
tact with us. All of it, Richard, all 
of it could be the result of a highly- 
sophisticated technology. After all, 
their technology managed to carry 
us across space from Earth and 
keep us in a rather comfortable 
and well-constructed zoo.” 

“I don’t know what to — ”

I was interrupted by the sound 
of an immense explosion. We’d 
traveled about four blocks in a 
straight line from the scene of the 
fire. Looking back, we saw a large 
mushroom cloud of smoke rising 
from the sites of the buildings that 
had been the orphanage and the 
supposed explosives factory and 
whatever was next to each of them. 
We stood and stared at the disaster 
for several minutes. When the 
smoke had cleared and we’d 
walked closer, we couldn’t see any 
bodies. The only debris not belong- 
ing to the buildings was a mangled 
fire vehicle. I asked a woman pass- 
erby if anybody’d been hurt. She 
said no, fortunately the firemen 
had gotten everybody out of the 
way just in time. 

“Evidently the firemen got them- 
selves out of the way, too,” Daisy 
muttered. 

“Yes, they did,” the woman said 
blandly and left us. 

“Staging,” Daisy said. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “Pretty 
elaborate for that.” 

“How do we know what’s elabo- 
rate for them?” 

“If you remember, I don’t even 
know if you’re one of their elabora- 
tions.” 

“I’m not. And I’m beginning to 
believe you’re not, either.” 

We walked the streets for a long 
while, then found the hotel we’re 
in now. Daisy’s fallen asleep. Her 
snores are quite earthlike. I’m be- 
ginning to believe in her, too. 

Perhaps the fire was staged. 
Perhaps they hired orphan actors, 
firemen actors, crowd extras, pass-

ersby with bit parts, and put it all 
on for us. On Earth movie people 
never care about blowing up city 
streets if the light is right. Still, I 
recalled my own bravery. Our brav- 
ery. That was authentic. At least 
that was authentic. I think I can 
sleep comfortably with that. Or 
wake up Daisy and — no, sleep. 

Day 13 

I condemn Marchplateau. And 
you with it, Frank. I’ll spend the 
rest of my days trying to escape. I 
will not join your club. 

Daisy and I awoke this morning 
with the same thoughts. We were 
tired of aimlessly walking March- 
plateauian streets. With its emo- 
tionally-comatose citizens and 
their indifference to the suffering 
of children, Marchplateau seemed 
to offer us no real escape. There 
was no purpose in staying away 
from the zoo. We’d return. We’d 
turn ourselves in to Frank and 
make the best of our luxury-cage 
lives, eating the good food, living 
the good life. 

Finding the way back was easy. 
I remembered each step I’d ever 
taken on Marchplateau. I could al- 
most see my earlier footprints 
walking toward me. 

Nobody stopped us as we en- 
tered the grounds nor, as on the 
city streets, did anybody there pay 
us much attention. A couple of 
Marchplateauians nodded to us as 
if we were people they saw every 
day — co-workers or familiar 
tradesmen. Many others rushed by 
us, with papers and scientific de- 
vices on their omnipresent clip- 




boards. 

“Everything looks about the 
same,” Daisy said. “Everybody 
busy busy busy.” 

“I thought they’d be busy trying 
to locate us. They don’t even seem 
to notice us. Either that, or they 
haven’t noticed yet that we left.” 
“They do seem to take things in 
stride.” 

We came around the turning in 
the path that led to our March- 
plateau home. It had been painted 
since we’d left. A bright eye-hurt- 
ing red. Something in the paint 
must have been luminous, for rays 
seemed to shoot off the building’s 
surface in all directions. People 
still massed in front of the cage’s 
viewing windows, still walked the 
grounds around it. Several official 
types were still making their shor- 
thand notations on their clip- 
boarded papers. As we approached 
our building I said to Daisy: 

“I feel insulted. They’ve turned 
our place into an eyesore. I’m going 
to give Frank the what-for for that. 
God, I hope they haven’t painted 
the inside in the same way.” 
“Relax, it’s probably some new 
kind of test.” 

People, both scientists and view- 
ers, glanced up at us as we neared 
the building, but nobody seemed 
startled or in any way impressed 
by the fugitives’ return. Most just 
gave us the eye, then returned to 
what they were doing, staring at 
the viewing window or making no- 
tations. 

“Hi there,” I said to nobody in 
particular, and nobody in particu- 
lar responded. “We’re back,” I said 



to a passing scientist. 

“Good for you,” he answered, 
then looked us over and asked: 
“Who are you?” 

“Who are we?” 

“Yes, do you have a job here? 
I’m sorry, there are so many per- 
sonnel changes I can’t keep up 
with — ” 

“We’re a personnel change all 
right. We escaped. We belong in 
there. Put us back.” 

The man, and a few others, 
stared at us, then started to laugh. 

“They’re street-clowns,” a 
woman said. “I must say that’s one 
of the more annoying customs 
we’ve imported. And where’s your 
makeup anyway?” 

“We’re not street-clowns. We’re 
Richard and Daisy.” 

After a pause, while everyone 
stared dispassionately at us, the 
scientist said: 

“Well, what kind of act do you 
do?” 

“We’re the earthlings.” 

“Another pause, another laugh. 

“Good show,” the woman said. 
“Now that’s more the kind of joke 
I can react to.” 

“No. We really are the earthlings. 
We’ve come back. Your planet is 
like a steady diet of nitrates and 
we want our cages back.” 

The woman sighed. 

“I must say, this custom of aping 
the earthlings has gone too far, 
much too far. Why don’t we steal 
some beings from some other 
place? I am really getting tired of 
being besieged by Earth material 
wherever I go. Earth trinkets. 
Earth customs. Earth languages.

our people pretending to be earth- 
lings . 

“What do you mean, pretending? 
We’re the main attraction. Your 
people ’ve been coming to this, this 
zoo for weeks, just to see us. We’re 
famous. We’re Richard and Daisy. 
We capitulate.” 

“1 thought the earthling’s names 
were Jonathan and Mermina,” a 
man at the viewing window said. 

“That’s right,” the scientist said. 

“My name was never Jonathan,” 
I said. 

“And I certainly wouldn’t want 
to be called Mermina,” Daisy said. 
“That’s not even a proper Earth 
name. She must be a ringer.” 

“We know you're not Jonathan 
and Mermina,” the woman said. 
“They're in there.” 

She pointed toward the cage. 
Daisy and I, after looking startled 
at each other, approached the 
vievnng window. Marchplateau- 
ians parted before our advance, 
leaving us a clear path. 

“You look first,” Daisy whis- 
pered. 

I saw Jonathan looking back at 
me, his rather stupid eyes wide 
open with curiosity. He was just 
as interested in me as ‘I was in him. 
Daisy came to my side. 

“We’ve been replaced,” she said. 

Jonathan stuck out his tongue 
at us, then — in the European style 
of obscene gesture — flicked the 
back of his hand at us across the 
bottom of his chin. Turning, he 
walked away from the window ar- 
rogantly. Mermina, a tiny pretty 
woman who’d been standing back, 
whispered something to him. 

106 IF 



“I want to see Frank,” I said to 
the nearest official-looking person. 
At first he pretended not to under- 
stand me, then he made a signal to 
a subaltern. In a moment FVank 
came out of a side door of the 
bright-red building. 

“What can I do for you folks?” 
he said amiably. 

“In there,” I said, pointing to the 
cage. “We have first rights. We be- 
long in the cage. We’re the earth- 
lings. We have seniority.” 

Frank sighed. 

“This Marchplateau fad for 
earthlings has gone quite too far,” 
he said. “And now a new trend: the 
identification of two of our own 
with the Earth people to such an 
extent that they — ” 

“What do you mean, identifica- 
tion! What are you pulling, Frank? 
Quit jerking me around!” 

Frank’s face grew sad and he ad- 
dressed the onlookers: 

“See how well they pick up the 
phrases, the manners ... ah, pity.” 
A sympathetic murmur went 
through the crowd. 

“We are the earthlings,” I said, 
talking to the crowd myself. My 
voice. I’m afraid was whiny. 
“Rather, we were the earthlings. 
Before those interlopers. Some of 
you must’ve seen us.” 

Looking at their blank stares, I 
felt like a madman. I felt lost in a 
nightmare. I felt beaten. I shrugged 
and turned back to Frank. 

“All right, Frank, you win. We’re 
whatever you say we are. Just give 
us a cage to lie down in. I’m 
bushed.” 

“Oh, we can’t do that. It would 




interfere with the project. I 
wouldn’t want to disturb Jonathan 
and Mermina.” 

“Well, you’re sure as hell dis- 
turbing Richard and Daisy. Look, 
we have no place to go, Frank. No 
way of functioning on March- 
plateau. No identity here, no use- 
fulness. No place to go, Frank!” 
My voice was desperate. I ex- 
pected Frank to say something in 
officialese or to tell us to go our 
own way, but 1 had to beg someone 
and he was the only March- 
plateauian I knew by name. 

“Come with me,” he said ami- 
ably. 

“ReaUy?” 

“Your complete identification 
with the earthlings has made you 
forget that any Marchplateau citi- 
zen who needs help, or a Job, or 
anything from another citizen wiU 
receive his request from him.” 
“Anything?” 

“Anything?” 

“Frank, it would give me great 
pleasure if you’d cut your throat 
from ear to ear with the sharp end 
of your chpboard.” 

I kind of wish he’d done that. 
What he did was take us to an of- 
fice and let us sit down on over- 
stuffed chairs. 

“Good to see you again, 
Richard,” he said. “You too, Daisy.” 
“Then you do know us,” I said. 
“How could I forget you?” 

“You faked it pretty well out 
there.” 

“We don’t like to confuse our vis- 
itors. They’re quite happy with 
Jonathan and Mermina. Our atten- 
dance here has doubled in the 



short time since we installed them 
in your place. Everyone here is 
quite pleased. Our study is pro- 
gressing by leaps and bounds. 
We’re very happy. You did us a 
favor by your escape.” 

“And you knew it beforehand. 
You planted the damn key in my 
pocket, Frank!” 

“Did 1? I don’t remember.” 

“I thought it was an act of com- 
passion, you son of a bitch!” 

“Why aren’t we as good as this 
Jonathan and Mermina?” Daisy 
said. 

“Oh, don’t feel insulted,” Frank 
said. “It is just a matter of supply 
and demand when you come down 
to it. Jonathan and Mermina are 
more open, outgoing people than 
either of you. We receive a lot from 
them. With you two, the supply had 
been exhausted and demand was 
quickly diminishing.” 

“Supply of what?” Daisy asked. 
“Demand for what?” 

“For Earth. We crave Earth here. 
As much as we can get. You must 
have noticed. We observe you, then 
go out and do like you . We enjoy 
being like you. You earthers are 
pretty hotshot stuff, multi-leveled 
in talent, ability, character, person- 
ality. You’re volatile, lovable, emo- 
tionally varied, sometimes emo- 
tionally extreme. You’re intelli- 
gent, inventive, infuriating, inimita- 
ble. We love your traits. We love 
your cleverness. We love you. We 
love to watch you, whatever you 
do. You had quite an audience out 
there yesterday at that fire, you 
two. It was quite a kick.” 

“Then the fire was faked!” I 



Marchplateau 



107 




yelled. 

“Was it? I don’t know that it was. 
We have fires here. There are a lot 
of dissatisfied people here who 
don’t like what the rest of us are 
doing, who especially don’t like the 
work done here, and they often set 
fires deliberately. They took their 
revolutionary attitudes from a pair 
of your young people whom we ab- 
ducted from Earth a decade or so 
ago. The ranks of the dissidents 
have declined in recent years, and 
they’ve become noticeably listless 
and inactive recently. Still, your 
presence among them might have 
excited them to return to former 
ways. I was informed the fire was 
due to arson. On the other hand, I 
suppose it could have been faked. 
We do that sort of thing, too.” 

“Then, if I understand you cor- 
rectly, Frank, we’re just templates 
of cultural influence for you and 
your people,” Daisy said. 

“You could put it that way, Daisy. 
You two were quite good for us, 
very popular for a long while, and 
you really outdid yourselves yes- 
terday. But now, Jonathan and 
Mermina have the stage, as it were. 
It’s their turn. You people can now 
enjoy the kind of freedom we 
Marchplateauians enjoy. Your life 
is no longer in a cage. You are in 
the open air. It’s wonderful, really. 
1 envy you.” 

“The hell with all that, Frank!” I 
shouted. “I don’t want to be free 
on Marchplateau. I’d prefer the 
cage! If you’re through with us, 
take us back home. Take us to 
Earth.” 

“Oh, we couldn’t do that. We 



don’t want to become known on 
your planet. It would spoil the 
study. Your scientific people might 
find some way to intervene. We 
have, after all, been abducting 
people from your planet for many 
years. Your history is becoming 
our history, your culture our cul- 
ture. Oh, no, we can’t possibly — ” 
“Damn it, Frank, you can’t do 
this to us! I demand you give us 
proper treatment, I demand — ” 
“Oh, Richard, stow it! Can it. 
Throw in the towel. Take a walk. 
Hit the road. Stop and smell the 
roses. Wake up and smell the cof- 
fee. How is that for a command of 
Earth idiom?” 

“Frank, you can’t — ” 

“All right. I’ll give you a good 
opportunity. You can stay here, 
here in the compound. We even 
have a spare cage you can use. You 
won’t be on exhibit, but it’s livable. 
You can even be useful. You can 
work closely with Jonathan and 
Mermina and any other earthlings 
we bring back here. It might be 
useful for us to introduce you two 
at a key point in these studies. How 
about it?” 

1 haggled with him for a while 
longer. So did Daisy. But we finally 
agreed to his plan. My one satisfac- 
tion is that by working here I can 
do my bit to make Frank’s life mis- 
erable. 

They assigned Daisy and I nice 
quarters, almost as nice as our old 
cage. I can at least watch March- 
plateauian TV here. Some of it is 
videotaped from Earth. 

“They seem to assume we’ll stay 
together,” Daisy said as she en- 



108 



IF 




tered the cage. 

“If you want otherwise, you can 
tell them otherwise,” I said. 

“No! No, I don’t want otherwise. 
We Earth-types have to stick to- 
gether. And we can help Jonathan 
and Mermina.” 

“Don’t be silly. They’ll never be- 
lieve we’re from Earth. They’ll 
think we’re just two more March- 
plateauians out to confuse them. I 
for one will tell them I am from 
Marchplateau. Maybe they’re not 
even from Earth anyway. Maybe 
they’re ringers, Marchplateauians 
pretending to be Earth captives.” 

“I don’t think so, but you could 
be right. We have to try to help 
them anyway.” 

“All right. I’ll try. But I don’t 
know if I’d believe in us now.” 

Daisy faded into a sulk, but she’ll 
be okay. She’s right, in a way. We 
do need to stay together, for our 
sanity or something. 



Tomorrow I’ll turn this journal 
over to Frank. Let him indulge his 
clinic£il interest to his heart’s con- 
tent. Is your heart content, Frank? 
I hope it explodes when you reach 
the last sentence. 

I don’t know what Frank wiU do 
with this journal. It really doesn’t 
matter, I suppose. I would like it 
if he took it to Earth and left it 
there, my message in a bottle sent 
across a galaxy. 

So, if anybody on Earth is read- 
ing this, I would appreciate it if 
you would contact anyone you 
know in authority and tell him or 
her that Richard Treskitte and 
Daisy Martin are trapped on the 
planet of Marchplateau to which 
they were abducted some time ago. 
They would like to return to Earth. 
I doubt if it would do any good, 
but we’d appreciate the effort. 

Thank you. 

Over to you, Frank.

SAMURAI FUGUE 

by JESSICA AAVKNDA SALMONSON 
art: Tim Kirk 



Now I intend to tell you (and 
you’ll be glad to hear) the tale of 
Pirn, dim Pirn, who everyone said 
was slow, although: she passed the 
college entry exams and main- 
tained a stable, respectable, 
though not at all remarkable grade 
point average. 

The singular reason that Pirn 
seemed dim and failed the second 
grade, and later the seventh, was 
that she was obsessed, possessed, 
and crippled by a dear, precious 
love of film. 

When little, she would steal 
money from mummy’s purse and 
run away to the theater to watch 
serials and cartoons and coming 
attractions and advertisements 
and double or triple features, cov- 
ering a space of time from matinee 
to final show — ^by which hour her 
mummy would have noticed that 
Pirn, or if not Pirn then the money, 
was missing from the house. Then 
would a policeman fetch her home, 
for she was always precisely where 
presumed. 

110 IF 



As years passed, the serials no 
longer played; and later, the car- 
toons were all but foregone; the 
trailers and the ads grew ever shor- 
ter; and finally, progress was such 
that theaters showed not two, 
never three, but only one major 
feature. Yet the theater owners had 
not yet devised a manner by which 
to make the same amount of 
money by showing nothing at all, 
so Pirn was not upset. 

She would go everyday when 
she had the money, and she had 
the money because she collected 
and returned soda pop bottles, 
until the returnables vanished 
from the face of the planet along 
with the giant condor and the black 
footed ferret, at which point she 
began to collect old tires and 
pieces of aluminum (especially 
empty beer cans) to be recycled 
for a pretty penny. Pirn became 
known as “the scavenger.” In col- 
lege, this industry guaranteed an 
addition to her “regular” income 
(the money poppa sent for tuition, 




Samurai Fugue 



111 





books, and expenses). So she 
could afford to see a million 
movies. Her goal in life had been 
to see a million movies, but her 
goal was soon to change. 

In college. Pirn’s life had settled 
into a fairly routine going: School 
and study, scavenging, and going 
to the movies. It was easy to appor- 
tion her time for each, because she 
had done away with most of the 
frivolities like friendships, boys, or 
regular meals (except popcorn). 
She kept no pets and had no hob- 
bies or other untoward expense or 
time-consuming passion ( save the 
main one named above). 

She was studying a foreign lan- 
guage, and taking an extra class in 
filmmaking — the former so that 
someday she could make a living 
for herself, and the latter so there’d 
be a reason for doing so. 

Pirn was not persnickety about 
the quality of the films she saw. 
Oh, she knew the good ones from 
the bad ones all right; but it hap- 
pened that she could enjoy the bad 
ones too. She remembered all the 
casts, all the directors. She under- 
stood everything the actors and the 
directors intended to convey; and 
she understood what they man- 
aged to convey instead. Moreover, 
she understood the actors and di- 
rectors themselves, which scared 
the daylights out of the only direc- 
tor she had ever managed to talk 
to, a rather overblown Scandina- 
vian who didn’t like being seen 
through one bit. He ran away from 
Pirn flailing his arms in the air, 
shouting in a dry old voice that he 
would never lecture in America 

112 IF 



again and why didn’t everyone 
realize aU women, but especially 
American women, were evil 
witches. 

She went through phases of fa- 
vorites (everyone does); war films, 
old Hollywood dance comedies, 
Tarzan, spaghetti westerns, horse 
porno, and anything at all with 
Marjorie Main. She had phases for 
directors too: Azner, Renoir, 

Hawks, Woody Allen — no one too 
eclectic, for films were meant to 
be entertaining, not difficult. 

Even her first masturbatory ex- 
perience was in a theater (in this, 
she was quite slow, being all of 
seventeen at the time), fantasizing 
herself tucked neatly in the sheets 
twixt Bogey and the Babe. 

As her tastes ran in phases, so 
did her personality perform ac- 
robatic metamorphoses. Mummy 
liked to tell the story of the time 
a lady in the supermarket became 
convinced that Pirn was really Shir- 
ley Temple (irrespective of the fact 
that by then Shirley Temple was 
mummy’s age), but that was years 
ago. When Pirn learned to mastur- 
bate, for the longest while she 
strutted around like a drag queen 
being Mae West. Later she became 
more subtle and talked like 
Katharine Hepburn, until she over- 
heard someone say it was affected, 
at which point she became a sin- 
cere, intense Greta Garbo. Shortly 
after moving to the dormitory, she 
became Sean Connery, but poppa 
came to visit and for two months 
afterward she didn’t get her usual 
check in the mail, until she went 
screaming home for a weekend 




being Sue Lyon and after that ev- 
erything was fine. 

In brief, Pirn’s life had been one 
long, slow, sedate stare at a silver 
screen. 

Two things altered Pirn’s cozy 
lifestyle. One of these was the dis- 
covery of chambara, or, to use a 
vulgar term, samurai films. With- 
out much lessening of the other 
types of films she saw, she yet 
began to pay especial attention to 
chambara, and often drove far-and- 
wide (gathering aluminum and old 
tires along the roadsides as she 
went) to attend any such film 
which might be playing on some 
other campus or in a farther city. 

The other thing to change Pirn 
was her foreign language studies. 
She had chosen Japanese partly 
because she was herself one-quar- 
ter Japanese. (Her Japanese-Amer- 
ican grandfather disappeared in a 
POW camp in Washington state; 
but the government apologized by 
giving back the property they’d 
taken away, which had to be sold 
for a ridiculously low price. Now, 
there was a big department store 
on that downtown block, and 
mummy occasionally went there 
and lamented how they might have 
been rich if only . .) Well, actually. 
Pirn had chosen that language be- 
cause a career counselor pointed 
out that more and more medical, 
scientific, and technical papers 
were published in Japanese and 
she could be assured a fairly se- 
cure if entirely boring job in trans- 
lation, which was a sight more than 
could be said for the students of 
any other foreign language. 



It might not at first be obvious 
how these two events — learning 
Japanese, and watching sjimurai 
films — changed Pirn’s life. The 
thing is, you must understand, that 
learning Japanese completely 
changed her method of viewing 
chambara movies, and thereby 
changed her attitude about all 
movies everywhere, which by as- 
sociation changed her attitudes 
about life in general which was it- 
self one overlong film in need of 
editing. 

In an American film, Pirn would, 
naturally, listen to the characters 
speak their lines. In, say, a French 
or German film, she read what the 
characters were saying, in the form 
of subtitles. But with chambara, as 
she learned Japanese, she began 
to do both at once! It was an amaz- 
ing effect, especially since the sub- 
titles generally told a slightly dif- 
ferent story than the spoken 
dialogue conveyed. 

Hearing and reading are two 
very different acts. The samurai 
films she watched began to take 
on certain aspects of a fugue, that 
is, a composition with two or more 
themes enunciated simultane- 
ously. It was like listening to two 
very different songs at the same 
time, yet without a single note of 
discord. 

Pirn was overwhelmed. She felt 
that she was watching two films 
at once. Such heaven! Such joy! 

Thus had she discovered there 
was really no pleasure quite the 
equal of watching samurai killing 
peasants, evil lords, and each 
other. 



Samurai Fugue

It was glorious. 

It was rare. 

The words at the bottom of the 
screen; the words from the mouths 

of the players they gave her 

two distinct, separate understand- 
ings of the same film. And though 
the two interpretations might con- 
tradict, they were yet, somehow, 
both, right. 

This awakenened her to the 
realization that there were actually 
more than two simultaneous 
stories being told in any given film. 
She did not mean the intellectual, 
subjective manipulation of literal, 
allegoric, symbolic or figurative 
levels. She meant that each film, 
in an objective fashion, was in re- 
ality a large number of films made 
all at the same time. 

She’d already noted the interpre- 
tation accessible through the sub- 
titles, and the one accessible 
through the words and intonation 
of the actors. Additionally, there 
was the story which the director 
intended, often at odds with what 
the actors or subtitles suggested. 
Plus, there was the story the script 
writer originally intended, some of 
which might remain. Atop all this, 
there was a whole other interpreta- 
tion to be achieved through the so- 
cial context outside the film, which 
was especially poignant in films 
made in a Japanese social context 
and viewed in an American social 
context. That made, let’s see, how 
many films she was watching at 
once? Five! The subtitled one, the 
spoken/acted one, the directed 
one, the scripted one, and the one 
of social context. Of course, even 



in bad films, these all blended into 
a smooth, unblurred image devoid 
of chaos. But for someone who had 
become atuned to the various over- 
lays, the actual complexity of every 
movie big and small was, in a word, 
captivating. 

She’d been watching Sword of 
Doom when she had these revela- 
tions. The film ended v^th a sud- 
denly frozen fi^ame, the warrior 
caught in eternal combat. But to 
Pirn it seemed that the samurai 
hadn’t stopped at all, that the film 
was still going on and on and on, 
and the cruel hero was still killing, 
^md killing, and killing — killing on 
nearly half a dozen levels — and she 
was mesmerized by the gory 
beauty of his every motion. The 
theater’s janitor poked her in the 
shoulder and asked, “Are you 
asleep, Miss?” 

“Shh!” said Pirn sharply. 

“But Miss . .” 

“Shush! I’m watching the 
movie.” 

“But, but, it’s been over for half 
an hour . .” 

Still she wouldn’t move, and the 
management had to throw her out 
bodily. As she staggered out into 
the night, she realized there was a 
sixth context for the film: the 
values brought to the movie by the 
production studio itself, that is, the 
financial point of the entire ven- 
ture, which in extreme cases over- 
shadowed an entire product and 
in every case had some influence. 

The next day, she returned to 
the same theater to watch Sword 
of Doom two more times, and they 
threw her out again. The manager. 



114 



IF 




who himself was Japanese and had 
a delicious accent, asked, “Don’t 
you know this is a bad movie? 
Don’t come tomorrow, please.” 

For the first time since the 
seventh grade. Pirn’s grades began 
to fall below their average. She 
spent almost all her study hours 
attempting to produce, for her film 
class, the perfect short subject for 
her personal purposes: a samurai 
fugue. Which reminded her of a 
seventh interpretation for a film: 
orchestral interpretation. A good 
soundtrack could tell a story all by 
itself! 

It was clear that she could not 
hope to bring these various levels 
for understanding or interpreta- 
tion to a film if she were the one 
and only creator, filling all the roles 
of actor, director, scripter, subti- 
tler, purveyor of social context, 
musical composer, studio man- 
ager, and choreographer. (That’s 
eight! She hadn’t thought of the in- 
terpretation through choreog- 
raphy before, which is very impor- 
tant especially in a samurai film, 
with the precise ballet of violence.) 

Pirn made her actor’s costume 
out of aluminum cans — and a fairly 
convincing suit of armor it became. 
She obtained a samurai sword, or 
close approximation, for an ex- 
travagant sum at a pawn shop in 
the Asian district. All other filming 
necessities were accessible 
through the school. But there was 
still only her her. How could she 
hope to have eight films in one with 
a single person’s input? The an- 
swer was inspired: She would mul- 
tiply her personality. 



It was complicated at first, de- 
ciding what her personalities 
ought to be. The choreographer 
would be a sadistic faggot. The di- 
rector was a tyrant. The script 
writer was a diletante convinced 
his every word was golden, out- 
raged by every alteration. The sub- 
titles were by a well meaning 
Japanese woman who didn’t really 
understand English at all (though 
she had a degree from Kyoto Uni- 
versity stating otherwise), but 
since her own father was de- 
scended from the samurai class, 
she took her duty seriously. The 
musical score was by a frustrated 
old nincompoop who had wanted 
to be another Bach but instead 
composed for B-grade films. The 
actor was an egotistical but other- 
wise fine, serious artist. The owner 
of the studio was a miser, who 
wanted successes, not art. Oh! 
There was another context for the 
film she hadn’t perceived before: 
the film editor's perspective. Very 
well: The editor’s persona would 
be: complete idiot. 

There was still the interpretation 
of social context outside the film 
itself. Hnun. That could be difficult. 
Ah! She had it: The social context 
was that everyone in the whole 
world was stark raving insane, in- 
cluding the nine people responsi- 
ble for the film, but especially the 
tenth person who was the entire 
audience (this would be Pirn her- 
self, so no specially devised per- 
sonality was necessitated). 

Considerable thought and imag- 
ination had gone into creating the 
various personalities who would 



Samurai Fugue 



115 




provide their own unique overlay 
and interpretation to the one-reel, 
one-actor chambara feature being 
made by the people mentioned 
above. But curiously, Pirn utterly 
forgot that she had invented these 
people, although each in turn ap- 
peared when needed to perform 
his or her required tasks. 

Since an audience was not yet 
needed (because the film wasn’t 
finished), the personality that was 
the original Pirn had not been 
called upon (this left more time for 
the others to complete the film, for 
it would have been difficult for 
them to work while she was gone 
to the movies). Pirn effectively 
ceased to exist. Therefore, she 
didn’t show up at her classes, or 
take calls from home, or answer 
anyone who called her by name. 

Occasionally, the hard-driving 
director or the artistic actor or the 
miserly studio owner would obtain 
cryptic communications which 
were obviously intended for some- 
one they didn’t know. Thus Pirn 
was never informed beforehand 
that she was being expelled from 
school for nonattendance and bad 
grade point average. However, the 
studio owner was indignant to find 
himself, one day, refused access to 
his studio, which a crazy man 
calling himself a fine arts professor 
claimed belonged to the college 
and was for the use of students 
only. The actor was upset to hear 
about this, as was the choreog- 
rapher, and especially the film 
editor whose job was soon to com- 
mence. Ths script and score writ- 
ers weren’t as concerned about all 



of this, as their jobs were com- 
pleted. 

The film progressed, somehow, 
and with the aid of the studio’s 
owner-manager (who figured he 
was kept out for failing to pay the 
rent), the film editor gained access 
to the dark rooms at night, and 
began to perform his finishing 
chores like the true idiot he was. 
The director argued to save key 
scenes which really did have to be 
spliced back in. 

When Pirn reappeared as herself, 
she was shghtly disoriented. She 
found herself in the viewing studio 
of the college, which was presently 
devoid of any other persons. She 
did not have the slightest notion 
that, for the past month, she hadn’t 
existed, or that at that very mo- 
ment her mummy and poppa were 
driving six hundred miles up the 
coast to get their poor sick daugh- 
ter and take her to a nice private 
hospital, or, as Thurber might have 
termed it, the booby hatch. 

None of this was part of her 
knowledge when the movie 
started. She was not even aware 
that this was the film she’d set out 
to make for a class in which she 
was no longer officially enrolled. 

Since the film editor and subti- 
tler had slaved through the night, 
it was presently time for morning 
classes to begin. Pirn’s film instruc- 
tor wandered into the viewing 
room at one point, and Pirn said 
hello; but he scurried out again, ap- 
parently not wishing to see this 
particular film today. 

She absorbed the film’s nine 
levels (or had they grown to fif- 



116 



IF 




teen?), comprehending all of them 
completely, becoming enmeshed 
within the most perfectly con- 
ceived movie that had ever as- 
saulted her heightened senses. It 
was the sad story of the last 
samurai, a young man, who had kil- 
led every human being in the world 
and now was all alone. She wept. 
She laughed. She shook with ter- 
ror. She was swept away in 
ecstacy. A truly wonderful achieve- 
ment! She gave the film a standing 
ovation. 

Afterward, the actor himself 
made an appearance, for this was, 
after all, the world premiere of the 
most important chambara movie 
since Seven Samurai, destined to 
win at Cannes, at the Asian Film 
Festival, at Toronto, New York, 
Chicago International... and Gosh!, 
Gee!, he had worn his costume, 
which without the camera tricks 
appeared to be made out of old 
tires and tin cans, and he had a 
cute samurai pony tail (was that 
his real hair so long?). 

It was about this time that 
mummy and poppa and the film 
instructor and a policeman and 
two gentlemen in white jackets ap- 
peared in the doorway of the view- 
ing studio. They approached 
slowly. They were talking to the 
actor in English, but he only knew 
Japanese. They seemed to be very 
cajoling as they surrounded the 
chambara star. 

Six or nine personalities chat- 



tered in her brain, trying to explain 
the situation to her, to him, to each 
other, with going-on-a-dozen dif- 
ferent interpretations regarding 
every innuendo. Life was a fugue, 
but something here was in discord. 
As the six cajoUng people sur- 
rounded Pirn, she suddenly 
realized that she’d been trans- 
ported into some terrible place in 
time. It was no longer 17th Century 
Japan, where she had studied fenc- 
ing like all good boys of her 
samurai class. She had somehow 
been sent forward in time to a 
frightful land where all the people 
were monstrous and insane (insan- 
ity had been, after all, the outside 
social context of the film). 

Pirn, the mighty samurai, carved 
through the monstrous, insane 
people of this future place. Blood 
sprayed all around. She screamed 
a samurai oath, and thanked the 
Shinto gods that she had survived 
this awful battle. Then the samurai 
youth left the corpse-strewn stage, 
trailing blood with her sword, and 
went out, out, out into the horrify- 
ing world. 

When they came for her, she was 
eating popcorn and watching the 
latest Clint Eastwood, which she 
thought a comforting movie be- 
cause it seemed to have only one 
very shallow level to it and there- 
fore didn’t stress her sensitivities. 
She never understood what the 
doctor meant when he said. Pirn, 
your movie has won eight awards.

NIGHT KINGS 

by ROGER ZELAZNY 
art: Mike Symes 



It began like any other night, but 
this one had a special feeling to it. 
The moon came up full and splen- 
did above the skyline, and its light 
spread like spilled buttermilk 
among the canyons of the city. The 
remains of the day’s storm exhaled 
mists which fled wraith-like across 
the pavements. But it wasn’t just 
the moon and the fog. Something 
had been building for several 
weeks now. My sleep had been 
troubled. And business was too 
good. 

I had been trying unsuccessfully 
to watch a late movie and drink 
one entire cup of coffee without 
its growing cold. But customers 
kept arriving, browsers lingered 
and the phone rang regularly. I let 
my assistant, Vic, handle as much 
of it as he could but people kept 
turning up at the counter — never 
during a commercial. 

“Yes, sir? What can I do for you?” 
I asked a middle-aged man with a 
slight tic at the left corner of his 
mouth. 

118 IF 



“Do you carry sharpened 
stakes?” he inquired. 

“Yes. Would you prefer the regu- 
lar or the fu*e-hardened?” 

“The fire-hardened, I guess.” 

“How many?” 

“One. No, better make it two.” 

“There’s a dollar off if you take 
three.” 

“Okay, make it three.” 

“Give you a real good price on 
a dozen.” 

“No, three should do it.” 

“All right.” 

I stooped and pulled out the car- 
ton. Damn. Only two left. I had to 
pry open another box. At least Vic 
had kept an eye on the level and 
brought a second carton up from 
the stockroom. The boy was learn- 
ing. 

“Anything else?” I asked as I 
wrapped them. 

“Yes,” the man said. “I need a 
good mallet.” 

“We carry three different kinds, 
at different prices. The best is a 
weighted — ” 




“I’ll take the best.” 

“Very good.” 

I got him one from beneath the 
adjacent counter. 

“Will this be cash, check, or 
credit card?” 

“Do you take Mastercharge?” 

“Yes.” 

He withdrew his wallet, opened 
it. 

“Oh, I also want a pound of gar- 
lic,” he said as he withdrew the 
card and handed it to me. 

I called to Vic, who was free just 
then, to fetch the garlic while I 
wrote up the order. 

“Thank you,” the man said sev- 
eral minutes later, as he turned and 
headed for the door, his parcel be- 
neath his arm. 

“Good night, good luck,” I said, 
and sounds of distant traffic 
reached me as the door opened, 
grew faint when it closed. 

I sighed and picked up my coffee 
cup. I returned to my seat before 
the television set. Shit. A dental 
adhesive commercial had just 
come on. I waited it out, and then 
there was Betty Davis... Moments 
later, I heard a throat-clearing 
sound at my back. Turning, I be- 
held a tall, dark-haired, dark-mus- 
tached man in a beige coat. He was 
scowling. 

“What can I do for you?” I asked 
him. 

“I need some silver bullets,” he 
said. 

“What caliber?” 

“Thirty-aught-six. Let me have 
two boxes.” 

“Coming up.” 

When he left I walked back to 

120 IF 



the john and dumped out my cof- 
fee. I refilled the cup with fresh 
brew from the pot on the counter. 

On my way back to the comfort- 
able corner of the shop I was 
halted by a leather-garbed youth 
with a pink punk haircut. He stood 
staring up at the tall, narrow, 
sealed case high upon the wall. 

“Hey Pops, how much is it?” he 
asked me. 

“It’s not for sale,” I said. “It’s 
strictly a display item.” 

He dug a massive wad of bills 
from his side pocket and extended 
it, his dreamy gaze never leaving 
the bright thing that hung above. 

“I’ve got to have a magic sword,” 
he said softly. 

“Sorry. I can sell you a Tibetan 
illusion-destroying dagger, but the 
sword is strictly for looking at 
here.” 

He turned suddenly to face me. 

“If you should ever change your 
mind...” 

“I won’t.” 

He shrugged then and walked 
away, passing out into the night. 

As I rounded the corner into the 
front of the shop, Vic fixed me with 
his gaze and covered the mouth- 
piece of the phone with the palm 
of his hand. 

“Boss,” he told me, “this lady 
says there’s a Chinese demon 
visits her every night and — ” 

“Tell her to come by and we’ll 
sell her a bedside temple dog.” 

“Right.” 

I took a sip of coffee and made 
by way back toward my chair as 
Vic finished the conversation and 
hung up. A small red-haired 




woman who had been staring into 
one of the display cases near the 
front chose that moment to ap- 
proach me. 

“Pardon me,” she said. “Do you 
carry aconite?” 

“Yes, I do — ” I began, and then 
I heard the sound — a sharp thunk, 
as if someone had thrown a rock 
against my back door. 

I had a strong feeling as to what 
it might be. 

“Excuse me,” I said, “Vic, would 
you take care of this lady?” 

“Sure thing.” 

Vic came over then, tall and rug- 
ged-looking, and she smiled. 

I turned away and passed 
through the rear of the shop and 
into the back room. I unlocked the 
heavy door that let upon the alley 
and drew it open. As I suspected, 
there was no one in sight. 

I studied the ground. A bat lay 
twitching feebly near a puddle. I 
stopped and touched it lightly. 

“Okay,” I said. “Okay, I’m here. 
It’s aU right.” 

I went back inside then, leaving 
the door open. As I headed for the 
refrigerator I called out, “Leo, I give 
you permission to enter. This one 
time. This one room and no 
farther.” 

A minute later he staggered in. 
He wore a dark, shabby suit and 
his shirtfront was dirty. His hair 
was windblown and straggly and 
there was a lump on his forehead. 
He raised a trembling hand. 

“Have you got some?” he asked. 

“Yeah, here.” 

I passed him the bottle I had al- 
ready opened and he took a long 



drink, then he slowly seated him- 
self in a chair beside the small 
table. I went back and closed the 
door, then sat down across from 
him with my cup of coffee. I gave 
him a minute for several more 
swallows and a chance to collect 
himself. 

“Can’t even hit a vein right,” he 
muttered, raising the bottle a final 
time. 

Then he put it down, ran his 
hands through his hair, rubbed his 
eyes and fixed me with a baleful 
gaze. 

“I can give you the locations of 
three who’ve just moved to town,” 
he said. “What’s it worth?” 
“Another bottle,” I said. 

“For three? Hell! I could have 
brought the information in one at 
a time and — ” 

“I don’t actively seek out your 
kind,” I told him. “I just provide 
others with what they need to take 
care of themselves. I do like having 
this sort of information, though...” 

“I need six bottles.” 

I shook my head. 

“Leo, you take that much and 
you know what’ll happen? You 
won’t make it back and — ” 

“I want six bottles.” 

“I don’t want to give them to 
you.” 

He massaged his temples. 
“Okay,” he said then. “Supposing 
I had a piece of important informa- 
tion that affected you personally? 
A really important piece of infor- 
mation?” 

“How important?” 

“Like life and death.” 

“Come on, Leo. You know me. 

Night Kings 121 




but you don’t know me that well. 
There’s not much in this world or 
any other — ” 

He said the name. 

“What?” 

He repeated it, but my stomach 
was already tightening. 

“Six bottles,” he said. 

“Okay. What do you know?” 

He looked at the refrigerator. I 
got up and went to it. I got them 
out and bagged each one sepa- 
rately. Then I put all of them into 
a larger brown bag. 1 brought it 
over and set it on the floor beside 
his chair. He didn’t even glance 
downward. He just shook his head. 

“If I’m going to lose my connec- 
tion this is the way 1 want it,” he 
stated. 

I nodded. 

“Tell me now.” 

“The Man came to town a couple 
of weeks ago,” he said. “He’s been 
looking around. He found you. And 
tonight’s the night. You get hit.” 

“Where is he?” 

“Right now? I don’t know. He’s 
coming, though. He called a meet- 
ing. Summoned everyone to All 
Saints across the river. Told us he 
was going to take you out and 
make it safe for us, that this was 
going to be his territory. Told 
everyone to get busy and keep you 
busy.” 

He glanced at the small barred 
window high on the rear wall. 

“I’d better be going,” he said 
then. 

I got up and let him out. I 
watched him stagger away into the 
fog. 

Tonight might well be the night

for him too. Hemoholic. A small 
percentage of them get that way. 
One neck is never enough. After a 
while they get so they can’t fly 
straight, and they start waking up 
in the wrong coffins. Then one 
morning they Just don’t make it 
back to bed in time. 1 had a vision 
of Leo sprawled dessicated on a 
park bench, brown bag clutched to 
his chest with bony fingers, the 
first light of day streaming about 
him. 

1 locked the door and returned 
to the shop. It’s a cold world out 
there. 

“. horns of the bull for maloc- 
chio," I heard Vic saying. “That’s 
right. You’re welcome. Good-bye.” 

I kept going, up to the front door. 
1 locked it and switched off the 
light. 1 hung the CLOSED sign in 
the window. 

“What is it?” Vic asked me. 
“Turn off the phone.” 

He did. 

Then, “Remember when 1 told 
you about the old days?” I said. 

“Back when you bound the ad- 
versary?” 

“Yup. And before that.” 

“Back when he bound you?” 
“Yup. You know, one of these 
days one of us will win — com- 
pletely.” 

“What are you getting at?” 

“He’s free again and he’s coming 
and I think he’s very strong. You 
may leave now if you wish.” 

“Are you kidding? You trained 
me. I’ll meet him this time.” 

I shook my head. 

“You’re not ready. But if any- 
thing happens to me ... If I 




lose. Then the job is yours if 
you’ll have it,” 

“I told you a long time ago, back 
when I came to work for you — ” 

“I know. But you haven’t 
finished your apprenticeship and 
this is sooner than I’d thought it 
would be. I have to give you a 
chance to back out.” 

“Well, I won’t.” 

“Okay, you’ve been warned. Go 
unplug the coffee pot and turn out 
the lights in back while I close 
down the register.” 

The room seemed to brighten a 
bit after he left and I glanced up. 
It was an effect of diffused moon- 
light through a full wall of fog 
which now pressed against the 
windows. It hadn’t been there mo- 
ments ago. 

I counted the receipts and put 
the money into the bag. I got out 
the tape. 

There was a pounding on the 
door just as Vic returned. We both 
looked in that direction. 

It was a very young woman, her 
long blonde hair stirred by the 
wind. She had on a light trench 
coat and she kept looking back 
over her shoulder as she ham- 
mered on the panel and the pane. 

“It’s an emergency!” she called 
out. “I see you in there! Please!” 

We both crossed to the door. I 
unlocked it and opened it. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked. 

She stared at me. She made no 
effort to enter. Then she shifted 
her gaze to Vic and she smiled 
slightly. Her eyes were green and 
her teeth were perfect. 

“You are the proprietor,” she 



said to me. 

“I am.” 

“And this . .?” 

“My assistant — ^Vic.” 

“We didn’t know you had an as- 
sistant.” 

“Oh,” I said. “And you are . ?” 
“His assistant,” she replied. 
“Give me his message.” 

“I can do better than that,” she 
answered. “I am here to take you 
to him.” 

She was almost laughing now, 
and her eyes were harder than I 
had thought at first. But I had to try. 

“You don’t have to serve him, ” 
I said. 

She sobered suddenly. 

“You don’t understand,” she told 
me. “I have no choice. You don’t 
know what he saved me from. I 
owe him.” 

“And he’ll have it all back, and 
more. You can leave him.” 

“Like I said, I have no choice.” 
“Yes, you do. You can quit the 
business right now.” 

“How?” 

I extended my hand and she 
looked at it. 

“Take my hand,” I said. 

She continued to stare. Then, al- 
most timidly, she raised hers. 
Slowly, she reached toward 
mine . 

Then she laughed and jerked 
hers back. 

“You almost had me there. Hyp- 
nosis, wasn’t it?” 

“No,” I said. 

“Well, you won’t trick me again.” 
She turned and swept her left 
arm backward. The fog opened, 
forming a gleaming tunnel.

“He awaits you at the other end.” 

“He can wait a moment longer 
then,” I told her, “Vic, stay here.” 

I turned and walked back 
through the shop. I halted before 
the case which hung high upon the 
wall. For a moment I just stared. I 
could see it so clearly, shining 
there in the dark. Then I raised the 
small metal hammer which hung 
on the chain beside it and I struck. 

The glass shattered. I struck 
twice again and shards kept falling 
upon the floor. I let go the hammer. 
It bounced several times against 
the wall. 

Carefully then I reached inside 
and wrapped my hand about the 
hilt. The dreaded familiar feeling 
flowed through me. How long had 
it been . ? 

I withdrew it from the case and 
held it up before me, my ancient 
strength returning, filling me once 
again. I had hoped that the last time 
would indeed be the last time, but 
these things have a way of dragging 
on. 

When I returned to the store- 
front the lady’s eyes widened and 
she drew back a pace. 

“All right, Miss,” I said. “Lead 
on.” 

“Her name is Sabrina,” Vic told 
me. 

“Oh? What else have you learn- 
ed?” 

“We will be transported to All 
Saints Cemetery, across the river.” 

She smiled at him, then turned 
toward the tunnel. She stepped 
into it and I followed her. 

It felt like one of those moving 
walkways the larger airports have. 

124 IF 



I could tell that every step I took 
bore me much farther than a single 
pace. Sabrina strode resolutely 
ahead, not looking back. Behind 
me, I heard Vic cough once, the 
sound heavily muffled within the 
gleaming, almost plastic-seeming 
walls. 

There was darkness at the end 
of the tunnel, and a figure waited, 
even darker, within it. 

There was no fog in the place 
where we emerged, only clear 
moonlight from amid a field of 
stars, strong enough to cause the 
tombstones and monuments to 
cast shadows. One of these fell be- 
tween us, a long line of separating 
darkness, in the cleared area 
where we stood. 

He had not changed so much as 
I felt I had. He was still taller, 
leaner and better-looking. He 
motioned Sabrina off to his right. 
I sent Vic to the side, also. When 
he grinned his teeth flashed, and 
he raised his blade — so black as to 
be almost invisible within its faint 
outlining nimbus of orange light — 
and he saluted me casually with it. 
I returned the gesture. 

“I wasn’t certain that you would 
come,” he said. 

I shrugged. 

“One place is as good as 
another,” I replied. 

“I make you the same offer I did 
before,” he stated, “to avoid the 
nastiness. A divided realm. It may 
be the best you can hope for.” 

“Never,” I responded. 

He sighed. 

“You are stubborn.” 

“And you are persistent.” 




“If that’s a virtue, I’m sorry. But 
there it is.” 

“Where’d you find Sabrina?” 

“In the gutter. She has real talent. 
She’s learning fast. I see that you 
have an apprentice now, also. Do 
you know what this means?” 

“Yes, we’re getting old, too old 
for this sort of nonsense.” 

“You could retire, brother.” 

“So could you.” 

He laughed. 

“And we could both stagger off 
arm in arm to that special Valhalla 
reserved for the likes of us.” 

“I could think of worse fates,” I 
said. 

“Good, I’m glad to hear that. I 
think it means you’re getting soft.” 
“I guess we’ll be finding out very 
soon.” 

A series of small movements 
caught my gaze, and I looked past 
him. Dog-like forms and bat-like 
forms and snake-like forms were 
arriving and settling and moving 
into position in a huge encircling 
mass all around us, like spectators 
coming into a stadium. 

“I take it we’re waiting for your 
audience to be seated,” I said, and 
he smiled again. 

“Your audience, too,” he replied. 
“Who knows but that even you may 
have a few fans out there?” 

I smiled back at him. 

“It’s late,” he said softly. 

“Long past the chimes of mid- 
night.” 

“Are they really worth it?” he 
asked then, a sudden serious look 
upon his face. 

“Yes,” I replied. 

He laughed. 




Night Kings 1 * 




“Of course you have to say that.” 

“Of course.” 

“Let’s get on with it.” 

He raised the blade of darkness 
high above his head and an un- 
earthly silence poured across the 
land. 

“Ashtaroth, Beelzebub, As- 
modeus, Belial, Leviathan . .” he 
began. 

I raised my own weapon. 

“Newton, Descartes, Faraday, 
Maxwell, Fermi ...” I said. 

“Lucifer Rofocale,” he intoned, 
“Hecate, Behemoth, Put Satanas, 
Ariaston ...” 

“Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rodin, 
Maillol, Moore ...” I continued. 

The world seemed to swim 
about us, and this place was sud- 
denly outside of space and time. 

“Mephisto!” he cried out. 
“Legion! Lilith! lanoda! Eblis!” 

“Homer, Virgil, Dante, Shakes- 
peare, Cervantes,” I went on. 

He struck and I parried the blow 
and struck one of my own to be 
parried in turn myself. He con- 
tinued his chanting and increased 
the tempo of his attack. I did the 
same. 

After the first several minutes I 
could see that we were still fairly 
evenly matched. That meant it 
would drag on, and on. I tried some 
tricks I had almost forgotten I 
knew. But he remembered. He had 
a few, too, but something in me 
recalled them also. 

We began to move even faster. 

The blows seemed to come from 
every direction, but my blade was 
there, ready for them when they 
fell. His had a way of doing the 



same thing. It became a dance 
within a cage of shifting metal, row 
upon row of glowing eyes staring 
at us across the field of the dead. 
Vic and Sabrina stood side by side 
yet seemed oblivious of each other 
in their concentration upon the 
conflict. 

I hate to say that it was exhilirat- 
ing, but it was. Finally, to face once 
again the embodiment of every- 
thing 1 had fought across the years. 
To have total victory suddenly lie 
but a stroke away, if but the right 
stroke might be found . 

I redoubled my efforts and actu- 
ally bore him back several paces. 
But he recovered quickly and 
stood his ground then. A sigh rose 
up from beyond the monuments. 

“You can still surprise me,” he 
muttered through clenched teeth, 
slashing back with a deadly attack 
of his own. “When will this ever 
end?” 

“How’s a legend to know?” I re- 
plied, giving ground and striking 
again. 

Our blades fed us the forces we 
had come to represent and we 
fought on, and on. 

He came close, very close, on 
several occasions. But each time I 
was able to spin away at the 
last moment and counter-attack. 
Twice, I thought that I had him and 
each time he narrowly avoided me 
and came on with renewed vigor. 

He cursed, he laughed, and I 
probably did the same. The moon 
dropped down and sparklets of 
dew became visible upon the grass. 
The creatures sometimes shifted 
about, but their eyes never left us.

IF 




Vic and Sabrina exchanged several 
whispered conversations without 
looking at each other. 

1 swung a head-cut, but he par- 
ried and riposted to my chest. I 
stopped it and tried for his chest, 
but he parried . 

A breeze sprang up and the per- 
spiration on my brow seemed sud- 
denly cooler. 1 slipped once on the 
damp ground and he failed to take 
advantage of my imbalance. Was 
he finally tiring? 

I tried pressing him once more, 
and he seemed a bit slower. Was I 
now gaining an edge or was it a 
trick on his part, to lull me? 

I nicked his biceps. The barest 
touch. A scratch. Nothing real in 
the way of an injury, but I felt my 
confidence rising. I tried again, 
mustering all of my speed in a fresh 
burst of enthusiasm. 

A bright line appeared across his 
shirtfront. 

He cursed again and swung 
wildly. As I parried it I realized that 
the sky was lightening in the east. 
That meant I had to hurry. There 
are rules by which even we are 
bound. 

I spun through my most elabo- 
rate attack yet, but he was able to 
stop it. I tried again, and again. 
Each time he seemed weaker, and 
on that last one I had seen a look 
of pain upon his face. A restless- 
ness came over our gallery then, 
and I felt that the fmal sands were 
about to descend the hourglass. 



I struck again, and this time I 
connected solidly. I felt the edge 
of my weapon grate against bone 
as it cut into his left shoulder. 

He howled and dropped to his 
knees as I drew back for the death 
blow. 

In the distance a cock crowed, 
and I heard him laugh. 

“Close, brother! Close! But not 
good enough,” he said. “Sabrina! 
To me! Now!” 

She took a step toward him, 
turned toward Vic, then back to 
my fallen nemesis. She rushed to 
him and embraced him as he began 
to fade. 

Aufwiedersehenr he called to 
me, and they both were gone. 

With a great rustling rush then, 
like blown leaves, our audience de- 
parted, flapping through the sky, 
flashing along the ground, slither- 
ing into holes, as the sun cut its 
way above the horizon. 

I leaned upon my blade. In a little 
while Vic came up to me. 

“Will we ever see them again?” 
he asked. 

“Of course.” 

I began walking toward what I 
saw to be the distant gate. 

“Now what?” he said. 

“I’m going home and get a good 
day’s sleep,” I told him. “Might even 
take a little vacation. Business is 
going to be slow for a while.” 

We crossed the hallowed earth 
and exited onto a sidestreet.

The Light Fantastic 

Book Reviews by Orson Scott Card 

( continued from page 29 ) 



cept to promise that there will be more 
books in the series, and you’ll be cheat- 
ing yourself if you don’t buy LIAVEK, 
read it in order, and see what can be 
done with a shared world whose con- 
tributors didn’t roll up their characters 
with D&D dice. 

Robin McKinley edited IMAGI- 
NARY LANDS, a traditional anthol- 
ogy with some decidedly non-tradi- 
tional stories. McKinley’s own “The 
Stone Fey” is a haunting story of a girl 
who loves an unloving man; Jane 
Yolen’s “Evian Steel” is a strong treat- 
ment of the coming-of-age theme; 
there are other good tales. For me, the 
standout is Peter Dickinson’s “Flight,” 
though 1 know some of you will say it 
reads like a historical essay. That’s be- 
cause it is a historical essay. It just 
happens to be a brilliant, unforgettable 
one. (Other readers have praised 
“Paper Dragons,” by James Blaylock. 
I can’t tell you why, because I found 
it unreadable — ^but it ended up as a 
Nebula Award finalist. Maybe you’ll 
like it better than I did. If you do, don’t 
write to me to explain why it’s good. 
I’ve read it twice, and I don’t ever want 
to think about it again.) 



Jane Yolen has long been known for 
writing Jewel-like fairy tales — some- 
thing most writers are smart enough 
not to attempt. Jane was too ignorant 
to know that good fairy tales, like 
folklore, have to grow out of years of 
retellings. So she wrote some anyway, 
and they were beautiful and original 
and powerful and true, and I fell in 
love with her work. (I also fell in love 
with her, a woman who, incredibly 
enough, manages to be Mom and 
Iconoclast at the same time.) 

Most of her short works have been 
published in young adult books; 
DRAGONFIELD for the first time col- 
lects her short fiction for an adult fan- 
tasy audience. The title story has never 
been published before, and is worth 
the price of the book. But you can also 
read “The Girl Who Cried Flowers,” 
“The Hundredth Dove,” “The Five 
Points of Roguery,” “Dream Weaver” — 
aw, hell, buy the book. I can’t describe 
these stories. Some of them are so 
short and densely packed that my 
synopsis would be longer than the tale 
itself. 

Contemporary poetry has long 
shown every sign of being dead — ^T.S. 



128 



IF 




Eliot and Ezra Pound killed it, and a 
thousand self-indulgent, incomprehen- 
sible, undisciplined, and untalented 
poets buried it. But ah! — something 
rises from the ashes! There are actually 
poets working today who are clear, 
who know how to make their language 
sing, who can stir your heart with their 
language. Let me recommend two of 
them who are working occasionaUy 
within the fantasy field today. Bruce 
Boston’s collection ALCHEMICAL 
TEXTS passes my first test of poetry: 
Does it have music, power, and mean- 
ing when it is read aloud? Yes, it does, 
with climaxes and closures that some- 
times left me gasping. 

Charles de Lint, poet, and Donna 
Gordon, artist, have collaborated on 
THE CALENDAR OF THE TREES, 
in which lovely iconic engravings are 
linked, month by month, with the enig- 
matic declarations of the trees: “Hazel 
am I and I / hoard knowledge / like a 
salmon in / a sheltered pool ...” This 
chapbook is beautifully printed on fine 
paper, and is only available in a se- 
verely limited edition. 

Both ALCHEMICAL TEXTS and 
THE CALENDAR OF THE TREES 
work by cumulative effect. You should 
read them in order, and you should 
read them aloud — at least in a whisper 
— so you can hear the music and the 
rhythms of the words. Each poem con- 
tains echoes of the ones before, and 
they build into a beautiful whole. You 
won’t find these little books on your 
bookstore shelves; you have to order 
them. They may just remind you of 
what poetry can be when it’s alive. 

Next Time 

Next time — if there is a next time 
(it aU depends on how many copies of 
this issue are sold, so if you want more 
of IF, make your friends buy their own 
copies) — ru review Sheri Tepper’s 



True Game series, which is science fic- 
tion that feels like fantasy, or maybe 
fantasy with sci-fi underpinnings. 
Whatever it is, I like it a lot, and there’s 
a lot of it to review. Eight volumes so 
far. I’ll also talk about her best work 
to date, MARIANNE, THE MAGUS, 
AND THE MANTICORE. And, of 
course, whatever I manage to read be- 
tween now and then. If all else fails, I 
can go back and talk about some 
hardcover novels that will be coming 
out in paperback about the time my 
review comes out — maybe THE 
POSTMAN or HUMAN ERROR. 
We’ll see.
