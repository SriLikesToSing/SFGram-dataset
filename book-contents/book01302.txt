H igh on the side of a hill outside 
San Francisco lives one of the 
finest science-fiction writers in the 
world. His name is Jack Vance and 
we had the pleasure of visiting his 
home a few weeks ago, during the 
course of the World Science Fiction 
Convention held in Berkeley. 

To reach the Vance estate you 
drive up a hill. Then you drive up a 
steeper hill. Then you drive up the 
steepest hill of all, shift into four- 
wheel drive, go a few yards further, 
then climb steps and ladders. His 
front lawn probably covers two or 
three acres — stood on end. All in 
all it is a charming place, an unusual 
one, and just right for the author 
of such charming, unusual and by 
gosh brilliant stories 2iS The Dragon 
Masters y The Moon Moth and the 
one that starts in next isues’s //, The 
Killing Machine. 

4t « « 

The convention itself, by the way, 
was a first-rate affair, populated 
with such fine writers as Vance, 
Poul Anderson, Clifford D. Simak 
(who picked up a Hugo of his own 
for the story in last year’s Galaxy, 
Here Gather the Stars), Frank Her- 



bert, Anthony Boucher — you name 
’em. Awards were flowing like water, 
and, as a matter of fact, your editor 
acquired one too: The Invisible 

Little Men’s Award, consisting of a 
mahogany base bearing the gold 
footprints of an invisible little man. 
Highlights of the affair were speech- 
es by the joint guests of honor, Ed- 
mond Hamilton and Leigh Brackett, 
a talk on science fiction in movies 
and television by a man who is re- 
sponsible for a lot of it, Harlan 
Ellison, a reminiscing talk by the 
fan guest of honor, Forrest J. Acker- 
man, and much more. If you haven’t 
ever been to a science-fiction con- 
vention, you don’t know what you’re 
missing. Next year’s will be in Lon- 
don . and what better reason 
could there be for a transAtlantic 
trip?

their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud-

When Time 
Was New 

BY ROBERT f. YOUNG 

ILLUSTRATED BY MORROW 



Ife searched through time 
tor a dream — and didn't 
know it when it came true! 



I to meet up with a stegosaurus sooner 

or later, but he hadn’t expected to 

T he stegosaurus standing beneath meet up with a boy and a girl. What 
the ginkgo tree didn’t surprise in the name of all that was Meso- 
Carpenter, but the two kids sitting zoic were they doing in the upper 
in the branches did. He had expected Cretaceous Period! 



6 





Maybe, he reflected, leaning for- 
ward in the driver’s seat of his bat- 
tery-powered triceratank, they were 
tied in in some way with the an- 
achronistic fossil he had come back 
to the Age of Dinosaurs to investi- 
gate. Certainly the fact that Miss 
Sands, his chief assistant who had 
cased the place-time on the time- 
scope, had said nothing about a 
couple of kids, meant nothing. Time- 
scopes registered only the general 
lay of the land. They seldom showed 
anything smaller than a medium- 
sized mountain. 

The stego nudged the trunk of 
the gingko with a hip as high as a 
hill. The tree gave such a convul- 
sive shudder that the two children 
nearly fell off the branch they were 
sitting on and came tumbling down 
upon the serrated ridge of the mon- 
ster’s back. Their faces were as 
white as the line of cliffs that 
showed distantly beyond the scat- 
terings of dogwoods and magnolias 
and live oaks, and the stands of 
willows and laurels and fan palms, 
that patterned the prehistoric plain. 

Carpenter braced himself in the 
driver’s seat. “Come on, Sam,” he 
said, addressing the triceratank by 
nickname, “let’s go get it!” 

S ince leaving the entry area sev- 
eral hours ago, he had been 
moving along in low gear in order 
not to miss any potential clues that 
might point the way to the ana- 
chronistic fossil’s place of origin — a 
locale which, as was usually the 
case with unidentifiable anachron- 
isms, the paleontological society 
that employed him had been able to 



pinpoint much more accurately in 
time than in space. Now, he threw 
Sam into second and focused the 
three horn-howitzers jutting from 
the reptivehicle’s facial regions on 
the sacral ganglion of the offend- 
ing ornithischian. Plugg! Plugg! 
Plugg! went the three stun charges 
as they struck home, and down went 
the a posteriori section .of the stego. 
The anterior section apprised by 
the pea-sized brain that something 
had gone haywire, twisted far 
enough around for one of the little 
eyes in the pint-sized head to take 
in the approaching triceratank, 
whereupon the stubby forelegs im- 
mediately began the herculean task 
of dragging the ten- ton, hump- 
backed body out of the theater of 
operations. 

Carpenter grinned. “Take it easy, 
old mountainsides,” he said. “You’ll 
be on all four feet again in less time 
than it takes to say Tyrannosaurus 
rex’.” 

After bringing Sam to a halt a 
dozen yards from the base of the 
ginkgo, he looked up at the two ter- 
rified children through the one-way 
transparency of the reptivehicle’s 
skull-nacelle. If anything, their faces 
were even whiter than they had been 
before. Small wonder. Sam looked 
more like a triceratops than most 
real triceratops did. Raising the na- 
celle, Carpenter recoiled a little 
from the sudden contrast between 
the humid heat of the midsummer’s 
day and Sam’s airconditioned inter- 
ior. He stood up in the driver’s 
compartment and showed himself. 
“Come on down you two,” he 
called. “Nobody’s going to eat you.’* 



WHEN TIME WAS NEW 



f 




Two pairs of the widest and 
bluest eyes that he had ever seen 
came to rest upon his face. In 
neither pair, however, was there the 
faintest gleam of understanding. “I 
said come on down,” he repeated. 
“There’s nothing to be afraid of.” 

The boy turned to the girl, and 
the two of them began jabbering 
back and forth in a sing-song tongue 
that resembled Chinese, but only as 
the mist resembles the rain. It had no 
more in common with modern 
American than its speakers had with 
their surroundings. Clearly they 
hadn’t understood a word he had 
said. But, equally as clearly, they 
must have found reassurance in his 
plain and honest face, or perhaps in 
the gentle tone of his voice. After 
talking the matter over for a few 
moments, they left their aerie and 
shinned down the trunk, the boy 
going first and helping the girl over 
the rough spots. He was about nine; 
she was about eleven. 

Carpenter stepped out of the com- 
partment, vaulted down from Sam’s 
steel snout and went over to where 
they were standing. By this time, 
the stego had recovered the use of 
its hind legs and was high-tailing — 
or rather, high-backing — it over the 
plain. The boy was wearing a loose, 
apricot-colored blouse which was 
considerably stained and disheveled 
from his recent arboreal activities, 
a pair of apricot-colored slacks which 
were similarly stained and disheveled 
and which terminated at his thin 
calves and a pair of open-toe san- 
dals. The girl’s outfit was identical, 
save that it was azure in hue and 
somewhat less stained and dishevel- 



ed. She was about an inch taller than 
the boy, but no less thin. Both of 
them had delicate features, and hair 
the color of buttercups, and both of 
them wore expressions so solemn as 
to be almost ludicrous. It was vir- 
tually a sure bet that they were 
brother and sister. 

G azing earnestly up into Car- 
penter’s gray eyes, the girl gave 
voice a series of sing-song phrases, 
each of them, judging from the nu- 
ances of pronunciation, representa- 
tive of a different language. 

When she finished. Carpenter 
shook his head. “I just don’t dig you, 
pumpkin,” he said. Then, just to 
make sure, he repeated the remark 
in Anglo-Saxon, Aeolic Greek, lovv^- 
er Cro-magnonese, upper-Acheulian, 
middle English, Iroquoian and Hy- 
annis-Portese smatterings of which 
tongues and dialects he had picked 
up during his various sojourns in the 
past. No dice. Every word he spoke 
was just plain Greek to the girl and 
the boy. 

Suddenly the girl’s eyes sparkled 
with excitement, and, plunging her 
hand into a plastic reticule that hung 
from the belt that supported her 
slacks, she withdrew what appeared 
to be three pairs of earrings. She 
handed one pair to Carpenter, one 
to the boy, and kept one for herself; ' 
then she and the boy proceeded to 
affix the objects to their ear lobes, 
motioning to Carpenter to do the 
same. Complying, he discovered that 
the tiny disks which he had taken for 
pendants were in reality tiny dia- 
phragms of some kind. Once the 
minute clamps were tightened into 



8

place, they fitted just within the ear 
openings. The girl regarded his hand- 
iwork critically for a moment, then, 
standing on tiptoe, reached up and 
adiiisted each disk with deft fingers. 
Satisfied, she stepped back. “Now,” 
she said, in perfect idiomatic Eng- 
lish. ‘we can get through to each 
other and find out what’s what.” 
C arpcnter stared at her. “Well I 
must say, you caught on to my lan- 
giia'c awful fast!” 

“Oh, we didn’t learn it,” the boy 
said. “Those are micro-translators — 
hearrin:s. With them on, whatever 
we sav sounds to you the way you 
would say it, and whatever you say 
sounds to us the way we would say 
it.” 

“1 forgot I had them with me,” 
said the girl. “They’re standard trav- 
elers' equipment, but, not being a 
traveler in the strict sense of the 
word, I wouldn’t have happened to 
have them. Only I’d just got back 
from foreign-activities class when 
the kidnapers grabbed me. Now,” 
she went on, again gazing earnestly 
up into Carpenter’s eyes, “I think it 
will be best if we take care of the 
amenities first, don’t you? My name 
is Marcy, this is my brother Skip, 
and we are from Greater Mars. What 
is your name, and where are you 
from, kind sir?” 

I t wasn’t easy, but Carpenter 
managed to keep his voice mat- 
ter-of-fact. It was no more than fair 
that he should have. If anything, 
what he had to say was even more 
incredible than what he had just 
heard. “I’m Howard Carpenter, and 
Tm from Earth, 2156 A. D. That’s 



79,062,156 years from now.” He 
pointed to the triceratank. “Sam 
over there is my time machine — 
among other things. When powered 
from an outside source, there’s 
practically no limit to his field of 
operations.” 

The girl blinked once, and so did 
the boy. But that was all. “Well,” 
Marcy said presently, “that much is 
taken care of: you’re from Earth 
Future and we’re from Mars Pre- 
sent.” She paused, looking at Car- 
penter curiously. “Is there some- 
thing you don’t understand, Mr. 
Carpenter?” 

Carpenter took a deep breath. 
He exhaled it. “In point of fact, 
yes. For one thing, there’s the little 
matter of the difference in gravity 
between the two planets. Here on 
Earth you weigh more than twice as 
much as you weigh on Mars, and I 
can’t quite figure out how you can 
move around so effortlessly, to say 
nothing of how you could have 
shinned up the trunk of that ginkgo 
tree.” 

“Oh, I see what you mean, Mr. 
Carpenter,” Marcy said. “And it’s a 
very good point, too. But obviously 
you’re using Mars Future as a cri- 
terion, and just as obviously Mars 
Future is no longer quite the same 
as Mars Present. I — I guess a lot 
can happen in 79,062,156 years. 
Well, anyway, Mr. Carpenter,” she 
continued, “the Mars of Skip’s and 
my day has a gravity that approxi- 
mates this planet’s. Centuries ago, 
you see, our engineers artificially 
increased the existent gravity in or- 
der that no more of our atmosphere 
could escape into space, and suc- 



10 



IF 




cessive generations have adapted 
themselves to the stronger pull. Does 
that clarify matters for you, Mr. 
Carpenter?” 

He had to admit that it did. “Do 
you kids have a last name?” he 
asked. 

“No, we don’t, Mr. Carpenter. 
At one time it was the custom for 
Martians to have last names, but 
when desentimentalization was in- 
troduced, the custom was abolished. 
Before we proceed any further, Mr. 
Carpenter, I would like to thank you 
for saving our lives. It — it was very 
noble of you.” 

“You’re most welcome,” Carpen- 
ter said, “but I’m afraid if we go on 
standing here in the open like this. 
I’m going to have to save them all 
over again, and my own to boot. So 
let’s the three of us get inside Sam 
where it’s safe. All right?” 

Leading the way over to the tri- 
ceratank, he vaulted up on the snout 
and reached down for the girl’s 
hand. After pulling her up beside 
him, he helped her into the driver’s 
compartment. “There’s a small door- 
way behind the driver’s seat,” he 
told her. “Crawl through it and make 
yourself at home in the cabin just 
beyond. You’ll find a table and 
chairs arid a bunk, plus a cupboard 
filled with good things to eat. All 
the comforts of home.” 

Before she could comply, a weird 
whistling sound came from above 
the plain. She glanced at the sky, 
and her face went dead-white. “It’s 
them!” she gasped. “They’ve found 
us already!” 

Carpenter saw the dark winged- 
shapes of the pteranodons then. 



There were two of them, and they 
were homing in on the triceratank 
like a pair of prehistoric dive-bomb- 
ers. Seizing Skip’s hand, he pulled 
the boy up on the snout, set him in 
the compartment beside his sister, 
and told them to get into the cabin 
fast. Then he jumped into the driv- 
er’s seat and slammed down the 
nacelle. 

Just in time: the first pteranodon 
came so close that its right aileron 
scraped against Sam’s frilled head- 
shield, and the second came so close 
that its ventral fuselage brushed 
Sam’s back. Their twin tailjets left 
two double wakes of bluish smoke. 

n 

C arpenter sat up straight in the 
driver’s seat. Ailerons? Fuse- 
lage? Tailjets? 

Pteranodons? 

He activated Sam’s shield-field 
and extended it to a distance of two 
feet beyond the armor-plating, then 
he threw the reptivehicle into gear. 
The pteranodons were circling high 
overhead. “Marcy,” he called, “come 
forward a minute, will you?” 

Her buttercup-colored hair tick- 
led his cheek as she leaned over his 
shoulder. “Yes, Mr. Carpenter?” 
“When you saw the pteranodons, 
you said, ‘They’ve found us already!’ 
What did you mean by that?” 
“They’re not pteranodons, Mr, 
Carpenter. Whatever pteranodons 
are. They’re kidnapers, piloting mili- 
tary-surplus flyabouts that probably 
look like pteranodons. They abduct- 
ed Skip and me from the prepara- 
tory school of the Greater Martian

Technological Apotheosization In- 
stitute and are holding us for ran- 
som. Earth is their hideout. There 
are three of them altogether — Roul 
and Fritad and Holmer. One of them 
is probably back in the spaceship.” 

Carpenter was silent for several 
moments. The Mars of 2156 A.D. 
was a desolate place of rubble, sand 
and wind inhabited by a few thou- 
sand diehard colonists from Earth 
and a few hundred thousand diehard 
Martians, the former living beneath 
atmosphere-domes and the latter, 
save for the few who had inter- 
married with the colonists, living in 
deep caves where oxygen could 
still be obtained. But twenty-second 
century excavations by the Extrater- 
restrial Archaeological Society had 
unearthed unquestionable evidence to 
the effect that an ultra-technological 
civilization similar to that of Earth 
Present had existed on the planet 
over 70,000,000 years ago. Surely it 
was no more than reasonable to as- 
sume that such a civilization had 
had space travel. 

That being the case, Earth, during 
her uppermost Mesozoic Era, must 
have presented an ideal hideout for 
Martian criminals, kidnapers includ- 
ed. Certainly such a theory threw 
considerable light on the anachro- 
nisms that kept cropping up in Cre- 
taceous strata. There was of course 
another way to explain Marcy^s and 
Skip’s presence in the Age of Dino- 
saOrs: they could be 2156 A.D. 
Earth children, and they could have 
wOme back via time machine the 
same as he had. Or they could have 
been abducted by twenty-second cen- 
tury kidnapers for that matter, and 



have been brought back. But, that 
being so, why should they lie about 
it? 

“Tell me, Marcy,” Carpenter 
said, “do you believe I came from 
the future?” 

“Oh, of course, Mr. Carpenter. 
And I’m sure Skip does, too. It^s — 
it^s kind of hard to believe, but I 
know that someone as nice as you 
wouldn’t tell a fib — especially such 
a big one.” 

“Thank you,” Carpenter said. 
“And I believe you came from 
Greater Mars, which, I imagine, is 
the planet’s largest and most pow- 
erful country. Tell me something 
about your civilization.” 

“It’s a magnificent civilization, 
Mr. Carpenter. Every day we pro- 
gress by leaps and bounds, and now 
that we’ve licked the instability 
factor, we’ll progress even faster.” 
“ The instability factor’?” 

“Human emotion. It held us 
back for years, but it can’t any 
more. Now, when a boy reaches his 
thirteenth birthday and a girl reach- 
es her fifteenth, they are desen- 
timentalizcd. And after that, they 
are able to make calm cool decisions 
strictly in keeping with pure logic. 
That way they can achieve maxi- 
mum efficiency. At the Institute 
preparatory school. Skip and I are 
going through what is known as the 
‘pre-desentimentalization process.’ 
After four more years we’ll begin 
receiving dosages of the desentimen- 
talization drug. Then — ” 

S KRRRREEEEEEEEEEK! went 
one of the pteranodons as it 
sideswiped the shield-field.

IF 




Carpenter watched it as it wob- 
bled wildly for a moment, and before 
it shot skyward he caught a glimpse 
of its occupant. All he saw was an 
expressionless face, but from its for- 
ward location he deduced that the 
man was lying in a prone position 
between the two twelve-foot wings. 

Marcy was trembling. “I — I think 
they’re out to kill us, Mr. Carpen- 
ter,” she said. “They threatened to 
if we tried to escape. Now that 
they’ve got our voices on the ransom 
tape, they probably figure they 
don't need us any more.” 

He reached back and patted her 
hand where it lay lightly on his 
shoulder. “It’s all right, pumpkin. 
With old Sam here protecting you, 
you haven’t got a thing to worry 
about.” 

“Is — is that really his name, 

“It sure is. Sam Triceratops, Es- 
quire. Sam, this is Marcy. You 
take good care of her and her 
brother — do you hear me?” He 
turned his head and looked into 
the girl’s wide blue eyes. “He says 
he will. I’ll bet you haven’t got 
anybody like him on Mars, have 
you?” 

She shook her head — as standard 
a Martian gesture, apparently, as it 
was a terrestrial — and for a moment 
he thought that a tremulous smile 
was going to break up on her lips. 
It didn’t, though — not quite. “In- 
deed we haven’t, Mr. Carpenter.” 

He squinted up through the na- 
celle at the circling pteranodons (he 
still thought of them as pteranodons, 
even though he knew they were 
not). “Where’s this spaceship of 
their’s, Marcy? Is it far from here?” 



She pointed to the left. “Over 
there. You come to a river, and 
then a swamp. Skip and I escaped 
this morning when Fritad, who was 
guarding the lock, fell asleep. They’re 
a bunch of sleepyheads, always fall- 
ing asleep when it’s their turn to 
stand guard. Eventually the Greater 
Martian Space Police will track the 
ship here; we thought we could hide 
out until they got here. We crept 
through the swamp and floated 
across the river on a log. It — it was 
awful, with big snakes on legs 
chasing us, and — and — ” 

His shoulder informed him that 
she was trembling again. “Look, 
I’ll tell you what, pumpkin,” he 
said. “You go back to the cabin 
and fix yourself and Skip something 
to eat. I don’t know what kind of 
food you’re accustomed to, but it 
can’t be too different from what 
Sam’s got in stock. You’ll find some 
square, vacuum-containers in the 
cupboard — they contain sandwiches. 
On the refrigerator-shelf just above, 
you’ll find some tall bottles with cir- 
clets of little stars — they contain 
pop. Open some of each, and dig 
in. Come to think of it. I’m hungry 
myself, so while you’re at it, fix 
me something, too.” 

Again, she almost smiled. “All 
right, Mr. Carpenter. I’ll fix you 
something special.” 

Alone in the driver’s compart- 
ment, he surveyed the Cretaceous 
landscape through the front, lateral 
and rear viewscopes. A range of 
young mountains showed far to the 
left. To the right was the distant 
line of cliffs. The rear viewscope 
framed scattered stands of willows.

fan palms and dwarf magnolias, 
beyond which the forested uplands, 
wherein lay his entry area, began. 
Far ahead, volcanos smoked with 
Mesozoic abandon. 

79,061,889 yean from now, this 
territory would be part of the state 
of Montana. 79,062,156 years from 
now, a group of paleontologists dig- 
ging somewhere in the vastly 
changed terrain would unearth the 
fossil of a modem man who had 
died 79,062,156 years before his 
disinterment. 

Would the fossil turn out to be 
his own! 

Carpenter grinned, and looked up 
at the sky to where the two pter- 
anodons still circle. It could have 
been the fossil of a Martian. 

He turned the triceratank around 
and started off in the opposite di- 
rection. “Come on, Sam,’’ he said. 
“Let’s see if we can’t find a good 
hiding place where we can lay over 
for the night. Maybe by morning I’ll 
be able to figure out what to do. 
Who’d ever have thought we’d wind 
up playing rescue-team to a couple 
of kids?” 

Sam grunted deep in his gear box 
and made tracks for the forested 
uplands. 

T he trouble with going back in 
time to investigate anachronisms 
was that frequently you found your- 
self the author of the anachronism 
in question. Take the classic instance 
of Professor Archibald Quigley. 

Whether the story was true or not, 
no one could say for certain, but, 
true or not, it pointed up the irony 
of time travel as nothing else could. 



A stanch Coleridge admirer. Profes- 
sor Quigley had been curious for 
years — or so the story went — as 
to the identity of the visitor who 
had called at the farmhouse in Ne- 
ther Stowey in the county of Som- 
ersetshire, England in the year 
1797 and interrupted Coleridge 
while the poet was writing down 
a poem which he had just com- 
posed in his sleep. The visitor had 
hung around for an hour, and af- 
terward Coleridge hadn’t been able 
to remember the rest of the poem. 
As a result, Kubla Khan was never 
finished. Eventually, Professor Quig- 
ley’s curiosity grew to such propor- 
tions that he could no longer endure 
it, and he applied at the Bureau of 
Time Travel for permission to re- 
turn to the place -time in order that 
he might set his mind at ease. His 
request was granted, whereupon he 
handed over half his life-savings 
without a qualm in exchange for a 
trip back to the morning in question. 
Emerging near the farmhouse, he 
hid in a clump of bushes, watching 
the front door; then, growing im- 
patient when no one showed up, ho 
went to the door himself, and 
knocked. Coleridge answered the 
knock personally, and even though 
he asked the professor in, the dark 
look that he gave his visitor was 
something which the professor nev- 
er forgot to the end of his days. 

Recalling the story. Carpenter 
chuckled. It wasn’t really anything 
for him to be chuckling about, 
though, because what had happened 
to the professor could very well 
happen to him. Whether he liked k 
or not, there was a good chance

IF 




that the fossil which the North 
American Paleontological Society 
had sent him back to the Mesozoic 
Era to investigate might turn out 
to be his own. 

Nevertheless, he refused to let 
the possibility bother him. For one 
thing, the minute he found himself 
in a jam, all he had to do was to 
contact his two assistants, Miss Sands 
and Peter Detritus, and they would 
come flying to his aid in Edith the 
therapod or one of the other rep- 
tivehicles w'hich NAPS kept on 
hand. For ant .her, he had already 
learned that outside forces were at 
work in the Cretaceous Period. He 
wasn’t the only candidate for fossil- 
dom. Anyway, worrying about such 
matters was a waste of time: what 
was going to happen had already 
happened, and that was all there was 
to it. 

S kip crawled out of the cabin 
and leaned over the back of 
the driver’s seat. ^‘Marcy sent you 
up a sandwich and a bottle of pop, 
Mr. Carpenter,” he said, handing 
over both items. And then, “Can I 
sit beside you, sir?” 

“Sure thing,” Carpenter said, 
moving over. 

The boy climbed over the back- 
rest and slid down into the seat. 
No sooner had he done so than an- 
other buttercup-colored head ap- 
peared. “Would — would it be all 
right, Mr. Carpenter, if — if — ” 
“Move over and make room for 
her in the middle. Skip.” 

Sam’s head was a good five feet 
wide, hence the driver’s compart- 
ment was by no means a small one. 



But the seat itself was only three 
feet wide, and accommodating two 
half-grown kids and a man the size 
of Carpenter was- no small accom- 
plishment, especially in view of the 
fact that all three of them were 
eating sandwiches and drinking pop. 
Carpenter felt like an indulgent par- 
ent taking his offspring on an excur- 
sion through a zoo. 

And such a zoo!, They were in 
the forest now, and around them 
Cretaceous oaks and laurels stood; 
there were willows, too, and screw 
pines and gingkos galore, and now 
and then they passed through in- 
congruous stands of fan palms. 
Through the undergrowth they 
glimpsed a huge and lumbering 
creature that looked like a horse in 
front and a kangaroo in back. Car- 
penter identified it as an anatosau- 
rus. In a clearing they came upon a 
struthiomimus and startled the os- 
trich-like creature half out of its 
wits. A spike-backed ankylosaurus 
glowered at them from behind a 
clump of sedges, but discreetly re- 
frained from questioning Sam’s 
right of way. Glancing into a tree- 
top, Carpenter saw him first arch- 
aeopteryx. Rising his eyes still high- 
er, he saw the circling pteranodons. 

He had hoped to lose them after 
entering the forest, and to this end 
he held Sam on an erratic course. 
Obviously, however, they were 
equipped with matter detectors. ' A 
more sophisticated subterfuge would 
be necessary. There was a chance 
that he might bring them down with 
a barrage of stun-charges, but it was 
a slim one and he decided not to 
try it in any event. The kidnapers 



WHEN TIME WAS NEW

undoubtedly deserved to die for 
what they had done, but he was not 
their judge. He would kill them if 
he had to, but he refused to do it 
as long as he had an ace up his 
sleeve. 

Turning toward the two children, 
he saw that they had lost interest in 
their sandwiches and were looking 
apprehensively upward. Catching 
their eye, he winked. “I think it’s 
high time we gave them the slip, 
don’t you?” 

“But how, Mr. Carpenter?” Skip 
asked. “ They’re locked right on us 
with their detector-beams. We’re 
just lucky ordinary Martians like 
them can’t buy super Martian wea- 
pons. They’ve got melters, which 
are a form of iridescers: but if they 
had real iridescers; we’d be goners.” 

“We can shake them easy, merely 
by jumping a little ways back in 
lime. Come on, you two — finish 
your sandwiches and stop worry- 
ing.” 

Their apprehension vanished, and 
excitement took its place. Let’s 
jump back six days,” Marcy said. 
“They’ll never find us then because 
we won’t be here yet.” 

“Can’t do it, pumpkin — it would 
take too much starch out of Sam. 
Time-jumping requires a tremendous 
amount of power. In order for a 
part-time time-machine like Sam to 
jump any great distance, its power 
has to be supplemented by the power 
of .a regular time station. The station 
propels the reptivehicle back to a 
pre-established entry area, and the 
time-traveler drives out of the area 
and goes about his business. The 
only way he can get back to the 



present is by driving back into the 
area, contacting the station and tap- 
ping its power-supply again, or by 
sending back a distress signal and 
having someone come to get him in 
another reptivehicle. At the most, 
Sam could make about a four-day 
round trip under his own power but 
it would burn him out. Once that 
happened, even the station couldn’t 
pull him back. I think we’d better 
settle for an hour.” 

I ronically, the smaller the tem- 
poral distance you had to deal 
with, the more figuring you had 
to do. After directing the tricera- 
tank via the liaison-ring on his right 
index finger to continue on its pres- 
ent erratic course. Carpenter got 
busy with pad and pencil, and pres- 
ently he began punching out arith- 
metical brain-twisters on the com- 
pact computer that was built into 
the control panel. 

Marcy leaned forward, watching 
him intently. “If it will expedite mat- 
ters, Mr. Carpenter,” she said, “I 
can do simple sums, such as those 
you’re writing down, in my head. 
For instance, 828,464,280 times 
4,692,438,921 equals 3,887,518,- 
032,130,241,880.” 

“It may very well at that, pump- 
kin, but I think we’d better check 
and make sure, don’t you?” He 
punched out the first two sets of 
numerals on the calculator, and de- 
pressed the multiplication button. 
3,889,518,032,130,241,880 the an- 
swer panel said. He nearly dropped 
the pencil. 

“She’s a mathematical genius,” 
Skip said. “I’m a mechanical genius

IF 




myself. That’s how come we were 
kidnaped. Our government values 
geniuses highly. They’ll pay a lot of 
money to get us back.” 

“Your government? I thought 
kidnapers preyed on parents, not 
governments.” 

“Oh, but out parents aren’t re- 
sponsible for us any more,” Marcy 
explained. “In fact, they’ve prob- 
ably forgotten all about us. After the 
age of six, children become the prop- 
erty of the state. Modern Martian 
parents are desentimentalized, you 
see, and don’t in the least mind 
getting rid of — giving up their chil- 
dren.” 

Carpenter regarded the two sol- 
emn faces for some time. “Yes,” 
he said, “I do see at that.” 

With Marcy’s help, he completed 
the rest of his calculations; then he 
fed the final set of figures into 
Sam’s frontal ganglion. “Here we 
go, you two!” he said, and threw 
the jumpback switch. There was a 
brief shimmering effect and an al- 
most imperceptible jar. So smoothly 
did the transition take place that 
Sam did not even pause in his 
lumbering walk. 

C arpenter turned his wristwatoh 
back from 4:16 P.M. to 3:16 
P.M. “Take a look at the sky now, 
kids. See any more pteranodons?” 
They peered up through the foli- 
age. “Not a one, Mr. Carpenter,” 
Marcy said, her eyes warm with 
admiration. “Not a single one!” 

“Say, you’ve got our scientists 
beat forty different ways from Sun- 
day!” Skip said. “They think they’re 
pretty smart, but I’ll bet they’ve 



never even thought of trying to 
travel in time . How far can 
you jump into the future Mr. Car- 
penter — in a regular time-machine, 
I mean?” 

“Given sufficient power, to the 
end of time — if time does have an 
end. But traveling beyond one’s own 
present is forbidden by law. The 
powers-that-be in .2156 consider 
it bad for a race of people to 
find out what’s going to happen to 
them before it actually happens, 
and for once I’m inclined to think 
that the powers-that-be are right.” 

He discontinued liaison control, 
took over manually and set Sam 
on a course at right angles to their 
present direction. At length they 
broke free from the forest onto the 
plain. In the distance the line of 
cliffs that he had noticed earlier 
showed whitely against the blue and 
hazy sky. “How’d you kids like to 
camp out for the night?” he asked. 

Skip’s eyes went round. “Camp 
out, Mr. Carpenter?” 

“Sure. We’ll build a fire, cook our 
food over it, spread our blankets on 
the ground — regular American Indi- 
an style. Maybe we can even find a 
cave in the cliffs. Think you’d like 
that?” 

Both pairs of eyes were round 
now. “What’s ‘American Indian 
style,’ Mr. Carpenter?” Marcy ask- 
ed. 

He told them about the Arapahoes 
and the Cheyennes and the Crows 
and the Apaches, and about the 
buffalo and the great plains and 
Custer’s last stand, and the Cones- 
togas and the frontiersmen (the old 
ones, not the “new”), and about

Geronimo aud Sitting Bull and Co- 
chise, and all the while he talked 
their eyes remained fastened on his 
face as though it were the sun and 
they had never before seen day. 
When he finished telling them about 
the settling of the west, he told 
them about the Civil War and Abra- 
ham Lincoln and Generals Grant 
and Lee and the Gettysburg Address 
and the Battle of Bull Run and the 
surrender at Appomattox. 

He had never talked so much in 
all his life. He wondered what had 
come over him, why he felt so 
carefree and gay all of a sudden and 
why nothing seemed to matter ex- 
cept the haze-ridden Cretaceous af- 
ternoon and the two round-eyed 
children sitting beside him. But he 
did not waste much time wondering. 
He went on to tell them about the 
signing of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence and the American Revolu- 
tion and George Washington and 
Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin 
Franklin and John Adams, and about 
what a wonderful dream the found- 
ing fathers had had and about 
how much better it would have 
turned out if opportunistic men had 
not used it to further their own 
selfish end and about how relatively 
wonderful it had turned out anyway, 
despite the many crimes that had 
been committed in its name. By 
the time .he finished, evening was 
on hand. The white cliffs rose up 
before them, shouldering the dark- 
ening sky. 

At the base of the cliffs they 
found a jim-dandy of an untenanted 
cave, large enough to accommodate 
both Sam and themselves and with 



enough room left over to build a 
campfire. Carpenter drove the rep- 
tivehicle inside and parked it in the 
rear; then he extended the shield- 
field till it included the cave, the side 
of the cliff and a large semi-circular 
area at the base of the cliff. After 
checking the “front yard” and find- 
ing that it contained no reptiles ex- 
cept several small and harmless liz- 
ards, he put the two children to 
work gathering firewood. Mean- 
while, he generated a one-way il- 
lusion-field just within the shield 
field so that the forthcoming camp- 
fire would not be visible from with- 
out. 

There was plenty of firewood 
available in the form of dead laurel 
and dogwod branches. Soon a re- 
spectable pile of fuel reposed just 
within the mouth of the cave. By 
this time Skip, at least, had shed 
his reserve. “Can I help build the 
fire, Mr. Carpenter?” he cried 
jumping up and down. “Can I — 
can I — can I?” 

“Skip!” Marcy said. 

“It^s all right, pumpkin,” Carpen- 
ter told her. “You can help, too, if 
you like.” 

T he walls of the cave turned red, 
then rosy, as young flames 
grew into full-fledged ones. 

Carpenter opened three packages 
of frankfurters and three packages 
of rolls and showed his. charges how 
to spear the frankfurters on the end 
of pointed sticks and roast them over 
the fire. Afterward he demonstrated 
how to place a frankfurter in a roll 
and smother it with mustard, pickle 
relish, and chopped onions. It was 



i8 



IF 




as though he had flung wide magic 
casements opening on enchanted 
lands that the two children had not 
dreamed existed. The last vestiges of 
solemnity departed from their faces, 
and during the next half hour they 
created and consumed six hot dogs 
apiece. Skip got so excited that he 
nearly fell into the fire, and the 
smile that had been trying all after- 
noon to break upon Marcy’s lips at 
last came through, teaching the 
flames to burn bright. 

Carpenter had made a pot of co- 
coa in Sam’s kitchenette, and nothing 
more was needed to round out the 
cookout except marshmallows. Was 
it remotely possible, he wondered, 
that his efficient chief assistant had 
included such nostalgic delicacies 
among the various supplies in Sam’s 
tail-compartment? It was doubtful 
at best, but he took a look anyway. 
To his delight, he found a whole 
box of them. 

Again, he performed a demon- 
stration, while the two children 
looked on in open-mouthed awe. 
When the two marshmallows which 
he had speared on his stick turned 
golden brown he thought for a mo- 
ment that Skip’s eyes were going to 
fall out of his head. As for Marcy, 
she just stood, there and stared as 
though Carpenter had said, “Let 
there be light!” and the first day 
had come into being. 

Laughing, he removed the marsh- 
mallows and handed one to each of 
them. “Skip!” xMarcy said when the 
boy popped his into his mouth and 
dispatched it with a single gulp, 
“where are your manners?” She ate 
her’s daintily. 



After the marshmallow roast, ht 
went outside and cut enough laurel 
and dogwood branches for three 
mattresses. He showed the children 
how to arrange the branches on the 
cavern floor and how to cover them 
with the blankets which he took out 
of Sam’s tail-compartment. Skip 
needed no further invitation to turn 
in: exhausted from his enthusiastic 
activities and becalmed by his full 
stomach, he collapsed upon his 
blanket as soon as he had it in place. 
Carpenter got three more blankets, 
covered him with one of them and 
turned to Marcey, “You look tired, 
too, pumpkin.” 

“Oh, but I’m not, Mr Carpenter. 
Not in the least bit. I’m two years 
older than Skip, you know. He’s 
just a kid.” 

H e folded the remaining two blan- 
kets into impromptu pillows and 
placed them a few feet from the 
fire. He sat down on one of them; 
she sat down on the other. All 
evening, grunts and growls and 
groans had been coming sporadical- 
ly from beyond the shield-field; now 
they were supplanted by an awe- 
some noise that brought to mind a 
gigantic road-repair machine break- 
ing up old pavement. The cavern 
floor trembled, and the firelight 
flickered wildly on the wall. “Sounds 
like old tyrannosaurus,” Carpenter 
said. “Probably out looking for a 
midnight snack in the form of a 
struthiomimus or two.” 

“ ‘Tyrannosaurus,’ Mr. Carpen- 
ter?” 

He described the ferocious thero- 
pod for her. S3ic nodded after he 



WHEN TIME WAS NEW 



19 




had finished, and a shudder shook 
her. “Yes,” she said, “Skip and I 
saw one. It was a little while after 
we crossed the river. We — we hid 
in a clump of bushes till he passed. 
What terrible creatures you have 
here on Earth, Mr. Carpenterl” 

“They no longer exist in my day 
and age,” Carpenter said. “We have 
terrible ‘creatures’ of another order 
— ‘creatures’ that would send old 
tyrannosaurus high-tailing it for the 
hills like a flushed rabbit. I shouldn’t 
be complaining, though. Our tech- 
nological debauchery left us with a 
cold-war hangover — sure; but it. 
paid off in quite a number of things. 
Time travel, for one. Interplanetary 
travel, for another.” At this point, 
the road-repair machine struck a 
bad stretch of pavement, and, judg- 
ing from the ungodly series of sound 
that ensued, blew a rod to boot. 
The girl moved closer to him. “Take 
it easy pumpkin. There’s nothing 
to worry about. An army of thero- 
pods couldn’t break through that 
shield-field.” 

“Why do you call me ‘pumpkin’, 
Mr. Carpenter? On Mars, a pump- 
kin is an unpleasant squashy vege- 
table that grows in swamps and mid- 
den-marshes.” 

He laughed. The sounds from be- 
yond the shield-field diminished, 
then faded away, as the theropod 
thundered off in another direction. 
“On Earth, a pumpkin is quite a 
nice vegetable — or maybe it’s a fruit. 
Whichever, it’s quite respectable. But 
that’s beside the point. ‘Pumpkin’ 
is what a man calls a girl when he 
likes her.” 

There was a silence. Then, “Do 



you have a real girl, Mr. Carpen- 
ter?” 

“Not actually, Marcy. You might 
say that figuratively speaking I wor- 
ship one from afar.” 

“That doesn’t sound like very 
much fun. Who is she?” 

“She’s my chief assistant at the 
North American Paleontological So- 
ciety where 1 work — Miss Sands. 
Her first name is ‘Elaine’, but I 
never call her by it. She sees to it 
that I don’t forget anything when I 
retro-travel, and she cases the place- 
times over a time-scope before I 
start out. Then she and my other 
assistant, Peter Detritus,' stand by, 
ready to come to the rescue if I 
should send back a can of chicken 
soup. You see, a can of chicken soup 
is our distress signal. It’s about as big 
an object as a paleontologivehicle 
can handle in most cases, and the 
word ‘chicken’ in our language can- 
notes fear.” 

“But why do you worship her 
from afar, Mr. Carpenter?” 

“Well you see,” Carpenter said, 
“Miss Sands isn’t just an ordinary 
run-of-the-mill girl. She’s the cool, 
aloof type — a goddess, if you know 
what I mean. Although I don’t see 
how you possibly could. Anyway, 
you simply don’t treat goddesses the 
way you treat mere girls — you keep 
your distance and worship them 
from afar and humbly wait for them 
to bestow favors upon you. I — I 
worship her so much, in fact, that 
every time I’m near her I get so 
flustrated that I can hardly say any- 
thing. Maybe after I get to know 
her better it’ll be different. So far. 
I’ve known her three months.” 



20 



IF 




H e fell silent. Marcy^s hearrings 
twinkled in the firelight as she 
turned and looked gently up into 
his face. “What’s the matter, Mr, 
Carpenter — cat got your tongue?” 
“I was just thinking,” Carpenter 
said. “Three months is quite a long 
time at that — long enough for a 
man to tell whether a girl is ever 
going to like him or not. And Miss 
Sands isn’t ever going to like me — 
I can see that now. Why, she doesn’t 
even look at me unless she absolute- 
ly has to, and she won’t say two 
words to me if she can possibly 
avoid it. So you see, even if I did 
stop worshipping her from afar and 
got up enough nerve to tell her that 
1 love her, she would probably only 
be annoyed and tell me to get lost.” 
Marcy was indignant. “She must 
be out of her mind, Mr. Carpenter 
— just plain out of her mind. She 
should be ashamed of herself!” 

“No, Marcy — you’ve got her all 
wrong. You can’t expect a girl as 
beautiful as she is to go for a good- 
for-nothing time-bum like me.” 

“A good-for-nothing time-bum in- 
deed! You know, Mr. Carpenter, I 
don’t think you understand women 
very well. Why, I’ll bet if you told 
her you love her, she’d throw her- 
self into your arms!” 

“You’re a romantic, Marcy. In 
real life, such things don’t happen.” 
He stood up “Well, young lady, I 
don’t know about you, but I’m tired. 
Shall we call it a day?” 

“If you wish to, Mr Carpenter.” 
She was asleep by the time he pull- 
ed her blanket up to her chin. As he 
stood there looking down at her, ^e 
turned on her side, and the firelight 



caught the buttercup-hue fuzz on the 
back of her neck, where her hair 
had been cut too short, and tinted it 
red-gold. All he could think of were 
buttercup-clad meadows in spring, 
and the warm clean sun rising and 
ushering in the dew- jeweled day . 

After checking to see if Skip was 
all right, he went over and stood in 
the cave mouth and stared out into 
the darkness. With tyrannosaurus’ 
departure, the lesser Cretaceous 
creatures had come out of their hid- 
ing places and were making their 
presence known again. He glimpsed 
the grotesque shapes of several orni- 
thopods; he saw an ankylosaurus 
standing immobile by a coppice of 
fan palms; he heard lizards scurrying 
both inside and outside the shield- 
field. A moon subtly different from 
the one he was most accustomed to 
was climbing into the prehistoric 
heavens. The difference lay in the 
number of meteorite craters. There 
were far fewer of them now than 
there would be 79,062,156 years in 
the future. 

He realized presently that al- 
though he was still looking at the 
moon he was no longer seeing it. He 
was seeing the campfire instead, and 
the girl and the boy enthusiastically 
roasting marshmallows. Why hadn’t 
he gotten married and had children? 
he wondered suddenly. Why had he 
passed up all the pretty girls he had 
ever known, only to fall hopelessly 
in love at the age of thirty-two with 
a beautiful goddess who preferred 
not to know he was alive? What had 
given him the notion that the thrill 
derived from adventure was some- 
how superior to the contentment de-

rived from loving and being loved? 
— that getting the bugs out of his- 
torical and pre-historical times was 
more important than getting the 
bugs out of his own life? That a 
lonely room in a boarding house 
was a man’s castle and that drinks 
drank in dim-lit bars with fun-girls 
he could no longer remember the 
next day spelled “freedom?” 

What treasure had he expected to 
find in the past that could equal 
the treasures he had passed up in 
the future? 

The night had grown chill. Be- 
fore lying down to sleep he added 
more wood to the fire. He listened 
to the flames crackle and watched 
their pale flickerings on the cavern 
walls. A lizard regarded him with 
golden eyes out of prehistoric shad- 
ows. In the distance, an omithopod 
went Waroompfl Beside him in the 
Mesozoic night the two children 
breathed softly in their green-bough 
beds. Presently he slept. 

Ill 

T he next morning, Carpenter 
wasted no time in getting the 
show on the road 

Marcy and Skip were all for re- 
maining in the cave indefinitely, but 
he explained to them that, were they 
to stay in one place, the kidnapers 
would find them that much sooner, 
and that therefore it would be better 
if they kept on the move. Thus far, 
everything he had told them had 
rung a bell in their language just 
as everything they had told him had 
rung a bell in his, but this time, for 
some reason, he had a hard time 



getting through to diem. Either t!iat, 
or they just plain didn^t want to 
to leave the cave. Leave it they 
did however — after ablutions per- 
formed in Sam^s compact lavatory 
and a breakfast of bacon and eggs 
cooked in Sam’s kitchenette — when 
he made it clear to them that he 
was still the boss. 

He hadn’t as yet decided on a 
definite plan of action. While trying 
to make up his mind, he let the 
triceratank. pick its own course over 
the plain — a feat for which its 
hypersensitive terrainometer more 
than qualified. 

Actually, he had only two choices: 
(1) — continue to play big brother to 
the two children and elude the kid- 
napers until they gave up or until 
the cavalry, in the form of the 
Greater Martian Space Police, ar- 
rived on the scene, or (2) — return 
to the entry-area and signal Miss 
Sands and Peter Detritus to bring 
the triceratank back to the present 
The second choice was by far the 
safer course of action. He would 
have settled for it without hesitation 
if it had not been for two things: 

(a) Marcy and Skip, while they un- 
doubtedly would be able to adapt 
to a civilization as similar to their 
own as twenty-second century ter- 
restrial civilization was, might never 
feel completely at home in it, and 

(b) sooner or later, they would 
come face to face with the demor- 
alizing information that their own 
civilization of 79,062,156 years ago, 
had long since turned to dust and 
that the technological dreams which 
they had been taught to regard as 
gospel had come to nothing. A pos-

IF 




sible third choice lay in taking them 
back to Earth Present, keep- 
ing them there until such time as 
the kidnapers gave up and left or 
until the Space Police showed up, 
and then returning them to Earth 
Past; but such a procedure would in- 
volve several round trips to the Cre- 
taceous Period. Carpenter knew 
without having to ask that, owing 
to the fantastic expense involved, 
NAPS’ budget couldn’t support even 
one such non-paleontological round 
trip, to say nothing of several. 

P ondering the problem, he be- 
came . aware that someone was 
tugging on his sleeve. It was Skip, 
who had come forward and climbed 
into the driver’s seat. “Can I steer 
him, Mr. Carpenter? Can I?” 
Carpenter surveyed the plain 
through the front, lateral, and rear 
viewscopes; then he raised Sam’s 
head and took a long look at the sky 
through the nacelle. A dark speck 
hovered high above the line of cliffs 
they had left less than an hour ago. 
As he watched, it was joined by 
two others. “Later on. Skip. Right 
now, I think we’ve got company.” 
Skip’s eyes had found the specks, 
too. “The pteranodons again, Mr. 
Carpenter?” 

“I’m afraid so.” 

The specks grew rapidly larger, 
resolved into winged shapes with 
narrow, pointed heads. Marcy had 
come forward, and her gaze, too, 
was directed at the sky. This time, 
she didn’t seem to be in the least 
bit frightened, and neither did Skip. 
“Are we going to jump back in time 
again, Mr. Carpenter?” she asked. 



“We’ll see, pumpkin,” he said. 

The pteranodons were clearly 
visible now. There was no question 
but what they were interested in 
Sam. Whether they would try at- 
tacking him again was another mat- 
ter. In any event, Carpenter decided 
that, even though the triceratank’s 
shield-field was in operation, his best 
bet would be to head for the near- 
est stand of trees. It was a stand of 
palmettos, and about half a mile dis- 
tant. He threw Sam into high, and 
took over the controls again. “Come 
on, Sam,” he said, to keep the kids’ 
morale from faltering, “show Mar- 
cy and Skip what you can dol” 

Sam took off like a twentieth- 
century locomotive, his flexible steel 
legs moving rhythmically, his alloy- 
hoofs pounding the ground in a 
thunderous cadence. Nevertheless, 
he was no match for the pterano- 
dons, and they overtook him easily. 
The foremost one swooped down a 
hundred yards ahead, released what 
looked like a big metal egg and 
soared skyward. 

The metal egg turned out to be a 
bomb. The crater that it created was 
so wide that it took all of Carpen- 
ter’s skill to guide Sam around it 
without rolling the reptivehicle over. 
Instantly he revved up the engine 
and shifted into second. “They’re 
not going to get us that way, are 
they, old timer?” he said. 

“URRRRRRRR!” Sam grunted. 

Carpenter glanced at the sky. All 
of the pteranodons were directly 
overhead now. Circling. One, two, 
three, he counted. Three . yester- 
day there had been only two. “Mar- 
cy,” he said, suddenly excited, “how 



24 



IF 




many kidnapers did you say there 
were?” 

“Three, Mr. Carpenter. Roul and 
Fritad and Holmer.” 

“Then they’re all up there. That 
means the ship is unguarded — im- 
less there^s a crew.” 

“No, Mr. Carpenter — here’s no 
crew. They did the piloting ttiem- 
selves.” 

He lowered his gaze from the cir- 
cling pteranodons. “Do you kids 
think you could get inside?” 
“Easy,” Skip said. “It’s a military- 
surplus flyabout-carrier with stan- 
dard locks, and standard locks are 
simple for someone with a little 
mechanical ability to disengage. 
That’s how come Marcy and I were 
able to escape in the first place. 
You just leave everything to me, 
Mr. Carpenter.” 

“Good,” Carpenter said. “We’ll be 
diere waiting for them when they 
come back.” 

W ith Marcy doing the figuring, 
retro co-ordinate calculus was 
a breeze. Sam was ready for jump- 
back in a matter of seconds. 

Carpenter waited till they were 
in the stand of palmettos, then he 
threw the switch. Again, there was a 
shimmering .effect and a slight jar, 
and daylight gave way to pre-dawn 
darkness. Behind them in a cave at 
the base of the cliffs, another tri- 
ceratank stood, and another Carpen- 
ter and another Marcy and Skip still 
slept soundly in their green-bough 
beds. 

“How far did we jump back this 
time, Mr. Carpenter?” Skip asked. 
Carpenter turned on Sam’s head- 



lights and began guiding him out of 
the stand of palmettos. “Four hours. 
That should give us plenty of time 
to reach the ship and get set before 
our friends return. We may even 
reach it before they start out — as- 
suming of course that they haven’t 
been searching for us round the 
clock.” 

“But suppose they spot us in 
this time-phase?” Marcy objected. 
“Won’t we be in the same pickle we 
just got out of?” 

“It’s a possibility, pumpkin. But 
the odds have it overwhelmingly 
that they didn’t spot us. Otherwise 
they wouldn’t have gone on search- 
ing for us — right?” 

She gazed at him admiringly. 
“You know something, Mr. Carpen- 
ter? You’re pretty smart.” 

Coming from someone who could 
multiply 4,692,438,921 by 828,404,- 
280 in her head, it was quite a com- 
pliment. However, Carpenter man- 
aged to take it in his stride. “1 hope 
you kids can find the ship now, ’’ ue 
said. 

“We’re already on the right 
course,” Skip said. “I know, because 
I’ve got a perfect sense of direction. 
It’s camouflaged as a big tree.” 

For the second time that morning, 
the sun came up. As had been the 
case yesterday, Sam’s size and mien 
cowed the various Cretaceous crea- 
tures they met although whether 
tyrannosaurus would have been sim- 
ilarly cowed had they come upon 
him was a ' moot question at best. 
In any case, they didn’t come upon 
him. By eight o’clock they were 
moving over the same terrain that 
Carpenter had come to not long

after leaving the forested uplands 
the day before. “Look!” Marcy ex- 
claimed presently. “There’s the tree 
we climbed when the humpbacked 
monster chased us!” 

“It sure is,” Skip said. “Boy, were 
we scared!” 

Carpenter grinned. “He probably 
thought you were some species of 
flora he hadn’t tried yet. Good thing 
for his digestive system that I hap- 
pened along when I did.” 

They looked at him blankly for a 
moment, and at first he thought that 
the barriers of two different lan- 
guages and two different thought 
worlds had been too high for his 
little joke to surmount. Such, how- 
ever, did not prove to be the case. 
First Marcy burst out laughing, and 
then Skip. “Mr. Carpenter, if you 
aren’t the darndest!” Marcy cried. 

T hey went on. The landscape 
grew more and more open, with 
coppices of palmettos and clusters 
of fan palms constituting most of the 
major plant-life. Far to the right, 
smoking volcanos added their dis- 
colored breath to the hazy atmos- 
phere. In the distances ahead, moun- 
tains showed, their heads lost in the 
Mesozoic smog. The humidity was 
so high that large globules of mois- 
ture kept condensing on Sam’s na- 
celle and rolling down like rain- 
drops. Tortoises, lizards, and snakes 
abounded, and once a real pterano- 
don glided swiftly by overhead. 

At length they came to the river 
which Marcy had mentioned and 
which the increasing softness of the 
ground had been heralding for some 
time. Looking downstream, Carpen- 



ter saw his first brontosaurus. 

He pointed it out to the kids, and 
they stared at it bug-eyed. It was 
wallowing in the middle of the slug- 
gish stream. Only its small head, its 
long neck, and the upper part of 
its back were visible. The neck 
brought to mind a lofty rubbery 
tower, but the illusion was marred 
by the frequency with which the 
head kept dipping down to the ferns 
and horse tails that lined the river 
bank. The poor creature was so enor- 
mous that it virtually had to keep 
eating day and night in order to stay 
alive. 

Carpenter found a shallows and 
guided Sam across the stream to the 
opposite bank. The ground was 
somewhat firmer here, but the firm- 
ness was deceiving, for the repti- 
vehicle’s terrainometer registered an 
even higher frequency of bogs. 
(Lord! Carpenter thought. Suppose 
the two kids had blundered into 
one!) Ferns grew in abundance, and 
there were thick carpets of sassafras 
and sedges. Palmettos and fan palms 
were still the rule, but there were 
occasional ginkgos scattered here 
and there. One of them was a veri- 
table giant of a tree, towering to a 
height of over one hundred and 
fifty feet. 

Carpenter stared at it. Cretaceous 
Period ginkgos generally grew on 
highground, not low, but a ginkgo 
the size of this one had no business 
growing in the Cretaceous Period at 
all. Moreover, the huge tree was in- 
congruous in other respects. Its 
trunk was far too thick, for one 
thing. For another, the lower part 
of it up to a height of about twenty 



26 



IF 




feet consisted of three slender sub- 
trunks, forming a sort of tripod on 
which the rest of the tree rested. 

At this point, Carpenter became 
aware that his two charges were 
pointing excitedly at the object of 
his curiosity “That’s ur Skip ex- 
claimed. “That’s the ship!'' 

“Well, no wonder it caught my 
eye,” Carpenter said. “They didn’t 
do a very good job of camouflaging 
it. I can even see one of the fly- 
about-bays.” 

Marcy said. “They weren’t partic- 
ularly concerned about how it looks 
from the ground. It’s how it looks 
from above that counts. Of course, 
if the Space Police get here in time 
they’ll pick it up sooner or later on 
their detector-beams, but it will fool 
them for a while at least.” 

“You talk as though you don’t ex- 
pect them to get here in time.” 

“I don’t. Oh, they’ll get here even- 
tually, Mr. Carpenter, but not for 
weeks, and maybe even months. It 
takes a long time for their radar- 
intelligence department to track a 
ship, besides which it’s a sure bet 
that they don’t even know we’ve been 
kidnaped yet. In aJl previous cases 
where Institute children have been 
abducted, the government has paid 
the ransom' first and then notified 
the Space Police. Of course, even 
after the ransom has been paid and 
the children have been returned, the 
Space Police still launch a search for 
the kidnapers, and eventually they 
find their hideout; but naturally the 
kidnapers are long gone by then. 

“I think,” Carpenter said, “that 
it’s high time a precedent was es- 
tablished, don’t you?” ^ 



A fter parking Sam out of sight in 
a nearly coppice of palmettos 
and deactivating the shield-field, he 
reached in under the driver’s seat and 
pulled out the only hand weapon the 
triceratank contained — a lightweight 
but powerful stun-rifle specially de- 
signed by NAPS for the protection 
of time-travel personnel. Slinging it 
on his shoulder, he threw open the 
nacelle, stepped out onto Sam’s snout 
and helped the two children down 
to the ground. The trio approached 
the ship. 

Skip shinned up one of the landing 
jacks, climbed some distance up the 
trunk and had the locks open in a 
matter of seconds. He lowered an 
aluminum ladder. “Everything’s all 
set, Mr. Carpenter.” 

Marcy glanced over her shoulder 
at the palmetto coppice. “Will — will 
Sam be all right do you think?” 
“Of course he will, pumpkin,” 
Carpenter said. “Up with you now.” 
The ship’s air-conditioned interior 
had a temperature that paralleled 
Sam’s, the lighting was cool, sub- 
dued. Beyond the inner lock, a brief 
corridor led to a spiral steel stairway 
that gave access to the decks above 
and to the engine rooms below. 
Glancing at his watch, which he had 
set four hours back, Carpenter saw 
that the time was 8:24. In a few 
minutes, the pteranodons would be 
closing in on the Sam and Carpenter 
and Marcy and Skip of the “prev- 
ious” time-phase. Even assuming that 
the three kidnapers headed straight 
for the ship afterward, there was 
still time to spare — time enough, 
certainly, to send a certain message 
before laying the trap he had in

mind. True, he could send the mes- 
sage after Roul and Fritad an Hol- 
mer were safely locked in their cab- 
ins, but in the event that something 
went wrong he might not be able 
to send it at all, so it was better to 
send it right now. ‘‘Okay, you kids,” 
he said, “close the locks and then 
lead the way to the communica- 
tions-room.” 

They obeyed the first order with 
alacrity, but hedged on the second. 
Marcy lingered in the corridor. Skip 
just behind her. 

“Why do you want to go to the 
communications-room, Mr. Carpen- 
ter?” she asked. 

“So you kids can radio our po- 
sition to the Space Police and tell 
them to get here in a hurry. You 
do know how, I hope.” 

Skip looked at Marcy. Marcy 
looked at Skip. After a moment, 
both of them shook their heads. 
“Now see here,” Carpenter said, 
annoyed, “you know perfectly well 
you know how. Why are you pre- 
tending you don’t?” 

Skip looked at the deck. “We — 
we don’t want to go home. Mr. Car- 
penter.” 

Carpenter regarded first one sol- 
emn face and then the other. “But 
you’ve got to be home! Where else 
can you go?” 

Neither of them answered. Neither 
of them look^ at him. “It boils 
down to this,” he proceeded pre- 
sently. “If we succeed in capturing 
Roul and Fritad and Holmer, fine 
and dandy. We’ll sit tight, and when 
the Space Police get here we’ll turn 
them over. But if something goes 
wrong and we don’t capture them. 



we’ll at least have an ace up our 
sleeve in the form of the message 
you’re going to send. Now Fm fam- 
iliar with the length of time it 
takes to get from Mars to Earth in 
the spaceships of my day, but I 
don’t of course know how long your 
spaceships take. So maybe you two 
can give me some idea of the length 
of time that will elapse between the 
Space Police’s receipt of our mes- 
sage and their arrival here on Earth,” 
he asked. 

“With the two planets in their 
present positions, just over four 
days,” Marcy said. “If you like, Mr. 
Carpenter, I can figure it out for 
you right down to a fraction of 
a — ” 

“That’s close enough, pumpkin. 
Now, up the stairs with you, and 
you too. Skip. Time’s a-wastingl” 

They complied glumly. The com- 
munications-room was on the second 
deck. Some of the equipment was 
vaguely familiar to Carpenter, but 
most of it was Greek. A wide, deck- 
to-ceiling viewport looked out over 
the Cretaceous plain, and, glancing 
down through the ersatz foliage, he 
found that he could see the palmetto 
coppice in which Sam was hidden. 
He scanned the sky for signs of the 
returning pteranodons. The sky was 
empty. Turning away from the view- 
port, he noticed that a fourth party 
had entered the room. He unslung 
hds stun-rifle and managed to get it 
halfway to his shoulder; then, ZZZZ 
ZZTTT! a metal tube in the fourth 
party’s hand went, and the stun-rifle 
was no more. 

He looked incredulously down at 
his hand. 



28 



IF 




IV 

T he fourth party was a tall, 
muscular man clad in clothing 
similar to Marcy’s and Skip’s, but 
of a much richer material. The ex- 
pression on his narrow face con- 
tained about as much feeling as a 
dried fig, and the metal tube in his 
hand was now directed at the center 
of Carpenter’s forehead. Carpenter 
didn’t need to be told that if he 
moved so much as one iota he 
would suffer a fate similar to that 
suffered by his rifle, but the man 
vouchsafed the information anyway. 
“If you move, you melt,” he said. 

“No Holmer!” Marcy cried. 
“Don’t you dare harm him. He only 
helped us because he felt sorry for 
us.” 

“I thought you said there were 
only three of them, pumpkin,” Car- 
penter said, not taking his eyes from 
Holmer’s face. 

“That is all there are, Mr. Carpen- 
ter. Honest! The third pteranodon 
must have been a drone. They trick- 
ed us!” 

Holmer should have grinned, but 
he didn’t. There should have been 
triumph in his tone of voice when he 
addressed Carpenter, but there 
wasn’t. 

“You had to be from the future, 
friend,” he said. “Me and my bud- 
dies cased this place some time ago, 
and we knew you couldn’t be from 
now. That being so, it wasn’t hard 
for us to figure out that when that 
tank of your’s disappeared yesterday 
you either jumped ahead in time or 
jumped back in it, and the odds 
were two to one that you jumped 



back. So we gambled on it, fig- 
ured you’d try the same thing again 
if you were forced into it, and rigged 
up a little trap for you, which we 
figured you’d be smart enough to 
fall for. You were. The only reason 
I don’t melt you right now is be- 
cause Roul and Fritad aren’t back 
yet. 1 want them to get a look at you 
first. I’ll melt you then but good. 
And the brats, too. We don’t need 
them any more.” 

Carpenter recoiled. The dictates 
of pure logic had much in common 
with the dictates of pure vindictive- 
ness. Probably the pteranodons had 
been trying to “melt” Marcy, Skip, 
Sam, and himself almost from the 
beginning, and if it hadn’t been for 
Sam’s shield-field, they undoubtedly 
would have succeeded. Oh well. 
Carpenter thought, logic was a two- 
edged blade, and two could wield 
it as well as one. “How soon will 
your buddies be back, Holmer?” 

The Martian regarded him blank- 
ly. Carpenter tumbled to the fact 
that the man wasn’t wearing hear- 
rings then. 

H e said to Marcy: “Tell me, 
pumpkin, if this ship were to 
fall on its side, would either the 
change in its position or its impact 
with the ground be liable to set off 
an explosion? Answer me with a 
‘yes’ or a ‘no’ so that our friend 
here won’t know what we’re talking 
about.” 

“No, Mr. Carpenter.” 

“And is the structure of the ship 
sturdy enough to prevent the bulk- 
heads from caving in on us?” 

“Yes, Mr. Carpenter.” 



WHEN TIME WAS NEW 



29 




“How about the equipment in 
this room. Is it bolted down securely 
enough to prevent its being torn 
loose?” 

“Yes, Mr. Carpenter.” 

“Good. Now, as surreptitiously 
as you can, you and Skip start 
sidling over to that steel supporting 
pillar in the center of the deck. 
When the ship starts to topple, you 
hold on for dear life.” 

“What’s he saying to you, kid?” 
Holmer demanded. 

Marcy stuck her tongue out at 
him. “Wouldn’t you like to know!” 
she retorted. 

Obviously, the ability to make 
calm, cool decisions strictly in 
keeping 'with pure logic did not de- 
mand a concomitant ability to think 
fast, for it was not until that mo- 
ment, that the desentimentalized 
Martian realized that he alone of the 
four persons present was not wear- 
ing hearrings. 

Reaching into the small pouch 
that hung at his side, he withdrew 
a pair. Then, keeping his melter 
directed at Carpenter’s forehead with 
one hand, he began attaching them 
to his ears with the other. Mean- 
while, Carpenter ran his right thumb 
over the tiny, graduated nodules of 
the liaison-ring on his right index 
finger, and when he found the ones 
he wanted, he pressed them in their 
proper sequence. On the plain below, 
Sam stuck his snout out of the 
palmetto coppice. 

Carpenter concentrated, his 
thoughts riding the tele-circuit that 
now connected his mind with Sam’s 
sacral ganglion: Retract your horn- 
howitzers and raise your nacelle- 



shield, Sam. Sam did so. Now, back 
off, get a good run, charge the 
landing-jack on your right, and 
knock it out. Then get the hell out 
of the way! 

Sam came out of the coppice, 
turned and trotted a hundred yards 
out on the plain. There he turned 
again, aligning himself for the forth- 
coming encounter. He started out 
slowly, geared himself into second. 
The sound of his hoofbeats climbed 
into a thunderous crescendo and 
penetrated the bulkhead of the com* 
munications-room, and Holmer, who 
had finally gotten his hearrings into 
place, gave a start and stepped over 
to the viewport. 

By this time Sam was streaking 
toward the ship like an ornithischian 
battering-ram. No one with an IQ 
in excess of 75 could have failed to 
foresee what was shortly going to 
happen. 

Holmer had an IQ considerably 
in excess of 75, but sometimes hav- 
ing a few brains is just as dangerous 
as having a little knowledge. It was 
so now. Forgetting Carpenter com- 
pletely, the Martian threw a smafl 
lever to the right of the viewscope, 
causing the thick, unbreakable glass 
to retract into the bulkhead; then 
he leaned out through the resultant 
aperture and directed his melter to- 
ward the ground. Simultaneously, 
Sam made contact with the land- 
ing-jack, and Holmer went flying 
through the aperture like a jet-pro- 
pelled Darius Green. 

The two kids were already cling- 
ing to the supporting pillar. With a 
leap, Carpenter joined them. “Hang 
on, you two!” he shouted, and pro- 



30 



IF 




ceeded to practice what he preached. 
The downward journey was slow at 
first, but it rapidly picked up mo- 
mentum. Somebody should have yel- 
led. “TIMBER!” Nobody did, but 
that didn’t dissuade the ginkgo from 
fulfilling its destiny. Lizards scam- 
pered, tortoises scrabbled and sauro- 
pods gaped for miles around. KRR- 
RRRRUUUUUUMMMP! The im- 
pact tore both Carpenter and the 
children from the pillar, but he 
managed to' grab them and cushion 
their fall with his body. His back 
struck the bulkhead, and his breath 
blasted from his lungs. Somebody 
turned out the lights. 

A t length, somebody turned them 
back on again. He saw Marcy’s 
face hovering like a small pale moon 
above his own. Her eyes were like 



autumn asters after the first frost. 

She has loosened his collar and 
she was patting his cheeks and she 
was crying. He grinned up at her, 
got gingerly to his feet and looked 
around. The communications -room 
hadn’t changed any, but it looked 
different. That was because he was 
standing on the bulkhead instead oi 
on the deck. It was also because he 
was still dazed. 

Marcy, tears running down her 
cheeks, wailed, “I was afraid yo« 
were dead, Mr Carpenter!” 

He rumpled her buttercup-colored 
hair. “Fooled you, didn’t I?” 

At this point. Skip entered the 
room through the now horizontal 
doorway, a small container clutched 
in his hand. His face lit up when he 
saw Carpenter. “I went after some 
recuperative gas, but I guess yon

don’t need it after all. Gee, Fm glad 
you’re all right, Mr. Carpenter!” 

“I take it you kids are, too,” Car- 
penter said. 

He was relieved when both of them 
said they were. Still somewhat dazed, 
he clambered up the concave bulk- 
head to the viewport and looked out. 
Sam was nowhere to be seen. Re- 
membering that he was still in tele- 
circuit contact, he ordered the tri- 
ceratank to home in, after which 
he climbed through the viewport, 
lowered himself to the ground and 
began looking for Holmer’s body. 
When he failed to find it he thought 
at first that the man had survived 
the fall and had made off into the 
surrounding scenery. 

Then he came to one of the bogs 
with which the area was infested, 
and saw its roiled surface. He shud- 
dered. Well, anyway, he knew who 
the fossil was. 

Or rather, who the fossil had been. 

Sam came trotting up, circumvent- 
ing the bog in response to the ter- 
rainometer’s stimuli. Carpenter pat- 
ted the reptivehicle’s head, which was 
not in the least damaged from its 
recent collision with the landing jack; 
then he broke off liaison and re- 
turned to the ship. Marcy and Skip 
were standing in the viewport, star- 
ing at the sky. Turning, Carpenter 
stared at the sky, too. There were 
three specks in it. 

His mind cleared completely then, 
and he lifted the two children down 
to the ground. “Run for Sam!” he 
said. “Hurry!” 

He set out after them. They easily 
outmatched his longer but far-slower 
strides, gaining the reptivehicle and 



clambering into the driver’s com- 
partment before he had covered half 
the distance. The pteranodons were 
close now, and he could see their 
shadows rushing toward him across 
the ground. Unfortunately, however, 
he failed to see the small tortoise 
that was trying frantically to get out 
of his way. He tripped over it and 
went sprawling on his face. 

Glancing up, he saw that Marcy 
and Skip had closed Sam’s nacelle. 
A moment later, to his consternation 
the triceratank disappeared. 

Suddenly another shadow crept 
across the land, a shadow so vast 
that it swallowed those cast by the 
pteranodons. 

Turning on his side. Carpenter 
saw the ship. It was settling down 
on the plain like an extraterrestrial 
Empire State Building, and, as he 
watched, three rainbow-beams of 
light shot forth from its upper sec- 
tion and the three pteranodons went 
PFFFFFFTTT! PFFFFFFTT! 
PFFFFFFTTT! and were no more. 

The Empire State Building came 
solidly to rest, opened its street 
doors and extended a gangplank the 
width of a Fifth Avenue sidewalk. 
Through the doors and down the 
sidewalk came the cavalry. Looking 
in the other direction. Carpenter 
saw that Sam had reappeared in 
exactly the same spot from which 
he had vanished. His nacelle had re- 
opened, and Marcy and Skip were 
climbing out of die driver’s com- 
partment in the midst of a cloud of 
bluish smoke. Carpenter understood 
what had happened then, and he 
kissed the twenty-second century 
good-by.

IF 




T he two kids came running up 
just as the commander of the 
cavalry stepped to the forefront of 
his troops. Actually, the troops were 
six tall Martians wearing deep- 
purple togas and stern expressions 
and carrying melters, while the com- 
mander was an even taller Martian 
wearing an even purpler toga and 
an even sterner expression and car- 
rying what looked like a fairy god- 
mother’s wand. The dirty look which 
he accorded Carpenter was dupli- 
cated a moment later by the dirty 
look which he accorded the two 
children. 

They were helping Carpenter to 
his feet. Not that he needed help in 
a physical sense. It was just that 
he was so overwhelmed by the rapid 
turn of events that he couldn’t quite 
get his bearings back. Marcy was 
sobbing. 

“We didn’t want to burn Sam out, 
Mr. Carpenter,” she said, all in a 
rush, “but jumping back four days, 
two hours, sixteen minutes and three 
and three-quarter seconds and sneak- 
ing on board the kidnaper’s ship 
and sending a message to space 
Police Headquarters was the only 
way we could get them here in time 
to save your life. I told them what a 
pickle you’d be in, and to have their 
iridescers ready. Then, just as we 
were about to come back to the 
present Sam’s time-travel unit broke 
down and Skip had to fix it, and 
then Sam went and burned out any- 
way, and oh, Mr. Carpenter, I’m so 
sorry! Now, you’ll never be able 
to go back to the year 79,062,156 
again and see Miss Sands, and — ” 
Carpenter patted her on the shoul- 



der. “It’s all right, pumpkin. It*i 
all right. You did the right thing, 
and I’m proud of you for it.” 
shook his head in admiration.“Yoo 
sure computed it to a T, didn’t you?” 
A smile broke through the rain 
of tears, and the rain went away. 
“I’m — I’m pretty good at computa- 
tions, Mr. Carpenter.” 

“But / threw the switch,” Skip 
said. “And / fixed Sam’s time-travel 
unit when it broke down.” 

Carpenter grinned. “I know you 
did. Skip. I think the two of yon 
are just' wonderful.” He faced the tall 
Martian with the fairy-godmother 
wand, noted that the man already 
had a pair of hearrings attached to 
his ears. “I guess I’m almost as be- 
holden to you as I am to Marcy and 
Skip,” Carpenter said, “and I’m duly 
grateful. And now I’m afraid Tdei 
going to impose on your good will 
-still further and ask you to take me 
to Mars with you. My reptivehicle’i 
burned out and can’t possibly be 
repaired by anyone except a group 
of technological specialists working 
in an ultra-modern machine shop 
with all the trimmings, which means 
I have no way either of contacting 
the era from which I came, or of 
getting back to it.” 

“My name is Hautor,” the taB 
Martian said. He turned to Marcy. 
“Recount tome with the maximum 
degree of conciseness of which you 
are capable, the events beginning 
with your arrival on this planet and 
leading up to the present moment.” 
Marcy did so. “So you see, sir,” 
she concluded, “in helping Skip and 
me, Mr. Carpenter has got himself 
in quite a pickle. He can’t return 



WHEN TIME WAS NEW 



33 




to his own era, and he can’t survive 
in this one. We simply have to take 
him back to Mars with us, and 
that’s all there is to it!” 

H autor made no comment. Al- 
most casually, he raised his 
fairy godmother wand, pointed it 
toward the kidnapers’ prostrate ship 
and did ‘something to the handle 
that caused the wand proper to 
glow in brilliant greens and blues. 
Presently a rainbow beam of light 
flashed forth from the Empire State 
Building, struck the kidnapers’ ship 
and relegated it to the same fate as 
that suffered by the three pterano- 
dons. Turning, Hautor faced two of 
his men. 

“Put the children on board the 
police cruiser and see to it that they 
are suitably cared for.” Finally, he 
turned back to Carpenter. “The gov- 
ernment of Greater Mars is grateful 
for the services you have rendered it 
in the preserving of the lives of two 
of its most valuable citizens-to-be. 
I thank you in its behalf. And now, 
Mr. Carpenter, good-by.” 

Hautor started to turn away. In- 
stantly Marcy and Skip ran to his 
side. “You can’t leave him here!” 
Marcy cried. “He’ll die!” 

Hautor signaled to the two Mar- 
tians whom he had spoken to a 
moment ago. They leaped forward, 
seized the two children and began 
dragging them toward the Empire 
State Building. “Look,” Carpenter 
said, somewhat staggered by the 
new turn of events, but still on his 
feet, “I’m not begging for my life, 
but I can do you people some good 
if you’ll make room for me in your 



society. I can give you time travel, 
for one thing. For another — ” 

“Mr. Carpenter, if we had wanted 
time travel, we would have devised 
it long ago. Time travel is the pur- 
suit of fools. The pattern of the past 
is set, and cannot be changed; and 
in it that has not already been done, 
why try? And as for the future, who 
but an imbecile would want to know 
what tomorrow will bring?” . 

“All right,” Carpenter said. “I 
won’t invent time travel then, I’ll 
keep my mouth shut and settle down 
and be good solid citizen.” 

“You wouldn’t and you know it, 
Mr. Carpenter — unless we desenti- 
ment alized you. And I can tell from 
the expression on your face that 
you would never voluntarily submit 
to such a solution. You would rather 
remain here in your prehistoric past 
and die.” 

“Now that you mentioned it, I 
would at that,” Carpenter said. 
“Compared to you people. Tyran- 
nosaurus rex as a Salvation Army 
worker, and all the other dinosaurs, 
saurischians and ornithischians alike, 
have hearts of purest gold. But it 
seems to me that there is one simple 
thing which you could do in my be- 
half without severely affecting your 
desentimentalized equilibrium. You 
could give me a weapon to replace 
the one that Holmer disintegrated.” 

Hautor shook his head. “That is 
one thing I cannot do, Mr. Carpen- 
ter, because a weapon could con- 
ceivably become a fossil, and there- 
by make me responsible for an ana- 
chronism. I am already potentially 
responsible for one in the form of 
Holmer’s irretrievable body, and I 



34 



IF 




refuse to risk being responsible for 
any more. Why do you think I ir- 
idesced the kidnapers’ ship?” 

“Mr. Carpenter,” Skip ciled from 
the gangplank, up which the two 
Martians were dragging him and his 
sister, “maybe Sam’s not completely 
burned out. Maybe you can rev up 
enough juice to at least send back 
can of chicken soup,” 

“Pm afraid no. Skip,” Carpenter 
called back. “But it’s all right, you 
kids,” he went on, “Don’t you 
worry about me — Pll get along 
okay. Animals have always liked 
me, so why shouldn’t reptiles! 
They’re animals, too.” 

“Oh, Mr. Carpenter!” Marcy 
cried. “Pm so sorry this happened! 
Why didn’t you take us back to 79,- 
062,156 witii you. We wanted you 
to all along, but we afraid to say 
so.” 

“I wish I had, pumpkin — I wish 
I had.” Suddenly, he couldn’t see 
very well, and he turned away. 
When he looked back, the two Mar- 
tians were dragging Marcy and Skip 
through the locks. He waved. 
“Good-by, you kids,” he called. 
“Pll never forget you.” 

Marcy made a last desperate 
effort to free herself. She almost, 
but not quite, succeeded. The au- 
tumn asters of her eyes were twink- 
ling with tears like morning dew. “I 
love you, Mr. Carpenter!” she cried, 
just before she and Skip were 
dragged out of sight. “Pll love you 
for the rest of my life!” 

With two deft movements, Hau- 
tor flicked the hearrings from Car- 
penter’s ears; then he and the rest of 
^e cavalry climbed the gangplank 

WHEN TIME WAS NEW 



and entered the ship. Some cavalry! 
Carpenter thought. He watched the 
street doors close, saw the Empire 
State Building quiver. 

Presently it lifted and hovered 
majestically, stabbed into the sky 
just above the ground on a wash of 
blinding light. It rose, effortlessly, 
and became a star. It wasn’t a falling 
star, but he wished i^n it anyway. 
“I wish both of you happiness,** 
he said “and I wish that they never 
take your hearts away, because your 
hearts are one of the nicest things 
about you.” 

The star faded then, and winked 
out. He stood all alone on the vast 
plain. 

• The ground trembled. Turning, he 
caught a great dark movement to the 
right ot a trio of fan palms. A mo- 
ment later, he made out the huge 
head and the massive, upright body. 
He recoiled as two rows of saber- 
like teeth glittered in the sun. 

Tyrannosaurus! 

V 

A bumed-out reptivehicle was 
better than no reptivehicle at 
all. Carpenter made tracks for Sam. 

In the driver’s compartment, with 
the nacelle tightly dosed, he watch- 
ed the theropod’s ^proach. There 
was no question but what it had 
seen him, and no question but what 
it was headed straight for Sam. 
Marcy and Skip had retracted the 
nacelle-shield, which left Carpenter 
pretty much of a sitting duck; how- 
ever, he didn’t retreat to Sam’s 
cabin just yet, for they had also 
re-projected the horn-howitzers. 

3i 




Although the howitzers were no 
longer maneuverable, they were still 
operable. If the tyrannosaurus came 
within their fixed range it could be 
put temporarily out of action with a 
volley of stun-charges. Right now, 
it was approaching Sam at right 
angles to the direction in which the 
howitzers were pointing, but there 
was a chance that it might pass in 
front of them before closing in. Car- 
penter considered it a chance worth 
taking. 

He crouched low in the driver’s 
seat, his right hand within easy 
reaching distance of the trio of trig- 
gers. With the air-conditioning unit 
no longer functioning, the interior ot 
the tricerafank was hot and stuffy. 
To add to his discomfort, the air 
was permeated with the acrid smell 
of burnt wiring. He shut his mind 
to both annoyances, and concentrat- 
ed on the task at hand. 

The theropod was so close now 
that he could see its atrophied fore- 
legs. They dangled down from the 
neck- width shoulders like the wizen- 
ed legs of a creature one tenth its 
size. Over them, a full twenty-five 
feet above the ground and attached 
to a neck the girth of a tree trunk, 
loomed the huge head; below them, 
the grotesque torso swelled out and 
down to the hind legs. The mighty 
tail dragged over the landscape, 
adding the cracking and splitting 
noises of crushed shrubbery to the 
thunder thrown forth each time the 
enormous bird-claw feet came into 
contact with the terrain. Carpenter 
should have been terrified. He was 
at a loss to understand why he 
wasn’t. 



Several yards from the triceatank, 
the tyrannosaurus came to a hall 
and its partically opened jaws began 
opening wider. 

The foot-and-a-half-high teeth 
with which they were equipped 
could grind through Sam's nacelle as 
though it was made of tissue paper, 
and from all indications, that was 
just what they were going to do. 
Carpenter prepared himself for a 
hasty retreat int6 Sam’s cabin; then 
just when things looked blackest, 
the therodon, as though dissatisfied 
with its present angle of attack, 
moved around in front of the rep- 
tivehicle, providing him with the op- 
portunity he had been hoping for. 
His fingers leaped to the first of tha 
trio of triggers, touched, but did-nol 
squeeze it. Why wasn’t he afraid? 

Jle looked up through the nacelle 
at the horrendous head. The huge 
jaws had continued to part, and now 
the whole top of the skull was 
raising into a vertical position. As 
he stared, a pretty head of quite an- 
other nature appeared over the low- 
er row of teeth and two bright blue 
eyes peered down at him. 

“Miss Sands!” he gasped, and 
nearly fell out of the drivers seat. 

R ecovering himself, he threw 
open the nacelle, stepped out 
on Sam’s snout and gave the tyr- 
rannosaurus an affectionate pat on 
the stomach. “Edith,” he said. 
“Edith, you doll, you!” 

“Are you all right, Mr Carpen- 
ter?” Miss Sands called down. 

“Just fine,” Carpenter said. “Am 
I glad to see youy Miss Sands!” 
Another head appeared beside 

IF 



36 




Miss Sands. The familiar chestnut 
haired head of Peter Detritus. “Are 
you glad to see me too, Mr. Car- 
penter?” 

“Well, I guess, Pete old buddy!” 
Miss Sands lowered. Edith’s lips 
ladder, and the two of them climbed 
down. Peter Detritus was carrying a 
low cable, and presently he proceed 
to affix it to Sam’s snout and Edith 
tail respectively. Carpenter lent a 
hand. “How’d you know I was in a 
pickle?” he asked. *T didn’t send 
back any soup.” 

“We had a hunch,” Peter E>etri- 
tus said. He turned to Miss Sands. 
“There, she’s all set, Sandy.” 

“Well let’s be on our way then,” 
Miss Sands said. She looked at Car- 
penter, then looked quickly away, 
*Tf, of course, your mission is com- 
pleted, Mr. Cai^nter.” 

Now that the excitement was over 
he was finding her presence just 
as disconcerting as he usually found 
h. “It’s completed all right. Miss 
Sands,” he said to the left pocket of 
her field blouse. “You’ll never be- 
Beve how it turned out, either.” 

“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. Some- 
times the most unbelievable things 
of all turn out to be the most be- 
lie veable one. I’ll fix you some- 
diing to eat, Mr. Carpenter.” 

She cliitibed agilely up the ladder. 
Carpenter followed, and Peter Detri- 
tus brought up the rear. “I’ll take 
the controls, Mr. Carpenter,” the 
latter said, pulling in the ladder. 
“You look bushed.” 

“I am,” Carpenter said. 

In Edith’s cabin, he collapsed on 
the bunk. Miss Sands went over to 
the kitchenette and put water on to 



boil for coffee and took a boiled 
ham down from the refrigerator- 
shelf. Up in the driver’s compart- 
ment, Peter Detritus closed the na- 
celle and threw Edith into gear. 

He was a good driver, Peter De- 
tritus was, and he would rather 
drive than eat. Not only that, he 
could take a paleontologivehicle 
apart and put it back together again 
blindfolded. Funny, why he and 
Miss Sands had never gone for each 
other. They were both so attractive, 
you’d have thought they would have 
fallen in love long ago. Carpenter 
was glad that they hadn’t of course 
— not that it was ever going to do 
him any good. 

He wondered why they had made 
no mention of the Space Police 
ship. Surely, they must have seen it 
when it blasted off . 

Edith was moving over the 
plain in the direction of the uplands 
now, and through the cabin view- 
port he could see Sam shambling 
along behind on motion-provoked 
legs. In the kitchenette. Miss Sands 
was slicing ham. Carpenter concern- 
trated on her, trying to drive away 
the sadness he felt over his parting 
with Marcy and Skip. His eyes 
touched her slender shapely legs, 
her slender waist, rose to her cupre- 
ous head, lingering for a moment 
on the silken fuzz that grew charm- 
ingly on the back of her neck where 
her hair had been cut too short. 
Strange, how people’s hair got dark- 
er when they grew older — 

Carpenter lay motionlessly on the 
bunk. “Miss Sands,” he said sudden- 
ly, “how much is 499,999,991 times 
8,003,432,111?” 



WHEN TIME WAS NEW 



37 




“400,171,598,369,111,001 ” Miss 
Sands answered. 

Abruptly she gave a start. Then 
she went on slicing ham. 

S lowly, Carpenter sat up. He low- 
ered his feet to the floor. A 
tightness took over in his chest and 
he could barely breathe. 

Take a pair of lonely kids. One of 
them a mathematical genius, the 
other a mechanical genius. A pair of 
lonely kids who have never known 
what it is like to be loved in all their 
lonely lives. Now, transport them 
to another planet and put them in a 
reptivehicle that for all its practi- 
cability is still a huge and delightful 
toy, and treat them to an impromptu 
Cretaceous camping trip, and show 
them the first affection they have 
ever known. Finally, take these 
things away from them and simul- 
taneously provide them with a su- 
preme motivation for getting them 
back — the need to have a human 
life — and include in that motivation 
the inbuilt possibility that by saving 
that life they can — in another but 
no less real sense — save their own. 

But 79,062,156 years! 49,000,000 
miles! It couldn^t be! 

Why couldn’t it?” 

They could have built the ma- 
chine in secret at the preparatory 
school, all the while pretending to 
go along with the “pre-desentimen- 
tilization process”; then, just before 
they were scheduled to begin re- 
ceiving doses of the desentimentali- 
zation drug, they could have en- 
tered the machine and time-jumped 
far into the future. 

Granted, such a time- jump would 



have required a vast amount of 
power. And granted, the Martian 
landscape they would have emerged 
on would have given them the shock 
of their lives. But they were re- 
sourceful kids, easily resourceful 
enough to have tapped the nearest 
major power source, and certainly 
resourceful enough to have endured 
the climate and the atmosphere of 
Mars Present until they located one 
of the Martian oxygen caves. The 
Martians would have taken care of 
them and have taught them all they 
needed to know to pass themselves 
off as terrestrials in one of the 
domed colonies. As for the colon- 
ists, they wouldn’t have asked too 
many questions because they would 
have been overjoyed to add two 
newcomers to their underpopulated 
community. After that, it would 
merely have been a matter of 
the two children’s biding their time 
till they grew old enough to work 
and earn their passage to Earth. 
Once on earth, it would merely have 
been a matter of acquiring the ne- 
cessary education to equip them for 
paleontological work. 

Sure, it would have taken them 
years to accomplish such a mission, 
but they would have anticipated that, 
and have time-jumped to a point in 
time far enough in advance of the 
year 2156 A.D. to have enabled 
them to do what they had to do. 
They had played it pretty close at 
that, though. Miss Sands had only 
been with NAPS for three months, 
and as for Peter Detritus, he had 
been hired a month later. On Miss 
Sands’ recommendation, of course. 

They had simply come the long 



38 



IF 




way around — that was all. Traveled 
49,000,000 miles to Mars Past, 79,- 
062,100 years to Mars Present, 49,- 
000,000 miles to Earth Present, and 
79,062,156 years to Earth Past. 

Carpenter sat there, stunned. 

Had they known they were going 
to turn out to be Miss Sands and 
Peter Detritus? he wondered. They 
must have — or, if not, they must 
have gambled on it and taken the 
names when they joined the colon- 
ist. All of which created something 
of a paradox. But it was a minor 
one at best, not worth worrying 
about. In any event, the names cer- 
tainly fitted them. 

But why had they passed them- 
selves off as strangers? 

Well, they had been strangers, 
hadn’t they? And if they had told 
him the truth, would he have be- 
lieved them? 

Of course he wouldn’t have. 

None of which explained why 
Miss Sands disliked him. 

But did she dislike him? Maybe 
her reaction to him resulted from 
the same cause that was responsible 
for his reaction to her. Maybe she 
worshipped him as much as he wor- 



shipped her, and became as tongue- 
tied in his presence as he did in hers. 
Maybe the reason she had never 
looked at him any longer than was 
absolutely necessary was that she 
had been afraid of betraying the 
way she felt before he learned the 
truth about her. 

He found it suddenly hard to see. 

T he smooth purring of Edith^s 
battery-powered motor filled the 
cabin. For quite sometime now there 
had been no other sound. 

“What’s the matter?” Miss Sands 
said suddenly out of clear blue sky. 
“Cat got your tongue, Mr. Carpen- 
ter?” 

He stood up then. She had turned, 
and was facing him. Her eyes were 
misted, and she was looking at him 
gently, adoringly ... the way she 
had looked at him last night, in one 
sense, and 79,062,156 years ago in 
another, by a Mesozoic campfire in 
an upper Cretaceous cave. Why Vll 
bet if you told her you loved her, 
she'd throw herself into your arms! 

“I love you, pumpkin,” Carpenter 
said. 

And Miss Sands did. END

If the coldest place In the

I n the coldest place in the solar 
system, I hesitated outside the 
ship for a moment. It was too dark 
out there. I fought an urge to stay 
close by the ship, by the comfort- 
able ungainly bulk of warm metal 
which held the warm bright Earth 
inside it. 

“See anything?*’ asked Eric. 

“No, of course not. It’s too hot 
here anyway, what with heat radia- 
tion from the ship. You remember 
the way they scattered away from 
the probe.” 

“Yeah. Look, you want me to 
hold your hand or something? Go.”

heavy collector boimcing gently on 



my shoulder. I bounced too. The 
spikes on my boots kept me from 
sliding. 

I walked up the side of the wide, 
shallow crater the ship had created 
by vaporizing the layered air all 
the way down to the water ice level. 
Crags rose about me, masses of 
frozen gas with smooth, rounded 
edges. They gleamed soft white 
where the light from my headlamp 
touched them. Elsewhere all was as 
black as eternity. Brilliant stars 
shone above the soft crags; but the 
light made no impression on the 
black land. The ship got smaller 
and darker and disappeared.

by vaporizing the layered air all 
the way down to the water ice level. 
Crags rose about me, masses of 
frozen gas with smooth, rounded 
edges. They gleamed soft white 
where the light from my headlamp 
touched them. Elsewhere all was as 
black as eternity. Brilliant stars 
shone above the soft crags; but the 
light made no impression on the 
black land. The ship got smaller 
and darker and disappeared. 

There was supposed to be life 



40 





here. Nobody had even tried to 
guess what it might be like. 1 wo 
years ago the Messenger VI probe 
had moved into close orbit about 
the planet and then landed about 
here, partly to find out if the cap 
of frozen gasses might be inflam- 
mable. In the field of view of the 
camera during the landing, things 
like shadows had wriggled across 
the snow and out of the light thrown 
by the probe. The films had shown 
it beautifully. Naturally some wise 
ones had suggested that they were 
only shadows. 

I’d seen the films. I knew better. 
There was life. 

Something alive, that hated light. 
Something out there in the dark. 
Something huge . “Eric, you 
there?*' 

“Where would I go?” he mocked 
me. 

“Well,” said I, “If I watched every 
word I spoke I’d never get any- 
thing said.” All the same, I had 
been tactless Eric had had a bad 
accident once, very bad. He 
wouldn’t be going anywhere unless 
the ship went along. 

“Touche,” said Eric “Are you 
getting much heat leakage from 
your suit?” 

“Very little.” In fact, the frozen 
air didn’t even melt under the pres- 
sure of my boots. 

“They might be avoiding even 
that little. Or they might be 
afraid of your light.” He knew I 
hadn’t seen anything; he was look- 
ing through a peeper in the top of 
my helmet. 

“Okay, I’ll climb that mountain 
and turn it off for awhile.” 



sv/im;^ my head so he could 
A see the mound 1 meant, then 
started up it. It was good ex- 
ercise, and no strain in the low 
gravity. I could jump almost as 
high as on the Moon, without fear 
of a rock’s edge tearing my suit. It 
was all packed snow, with vacuum 
between the flakes. 

My imagination started working 
again when I reached the top. 
There was black all around; the 
world was black with cold. I turn- 
ed off the light and the world dis- 
appeared. 

I pushed a trigger on the side of 
my helmet and my helmet put the 
stem of a pipe in my mouth. The 
air renewer sucked air and smoke 
down past my chin. They make 
wonderful suits nowadays. I sat and 
smoked, waiting, shivering with the 
knowledge of the cold. Finally I 
realized I was sweating. The suit 
was almost too well insulated. 

Our ion-drive section came over 
the horizon, a brilliant star moving 
very fast, and disappeared as it 
hit the planet’s shadow. Time was 
passing. The charge in my pipe 
burned out and I dumped it. 

“Try the light,” said Eric. 

I got up and turned the headlamp 
on high. The light spread for a 
mile around, white fairy landscape 
sprang to life, a winter wonderland 
doubled in spades. I did a slow 
pirouette, looking, looking . and 
saw it. 

Even this close it looked like a 
shadow. It also looked like a very 
flat, monstrously large amoeba, or 
like a pool of oil running across 
the ice. Uphill it ran, flowing slow-

ly and painfully up the side of a 
nitrogen mountain, trying desperate- 
ly to escape the searing light of 
my lamp. “The collector!” Eric 
demanded. I lifted the collector 
above my head and aimed it like a 
telescope at the fleeing enigma, so 
that Eric could find it in the col- 
lector’s peeper. The collector spat 
fire at both ends and jumped up 
and away. Eric was controlling it 
now. 

After a moment I asked, “Should 
I come back?” 

“Certainly not. Stay there. I can’t 
bring the collector back to the 
ship! You’ll have to wait and carry 
if back with you.” 

The pool-shadow slid over the 
edge of the hill. The flame of the 
collector’s rocket went after it, fly- 
ing high, growing smaller. It dipp^ 
below the ridge. A moment later I 
heard Eric mutter, “Got it.” The 
bright flame reappeared, rising fast, 
then curved toward me. 

When the thing was hovering 
near me on two lateral rockets I 
picked it up by the tail and carried 
it home. 

no trouble,” said Eric. “I 
^ just used the scoop to nip a 
piece out of his flank, if so I may 
speak. I got about ten cubic centi- 
meters of strange flesh.” 

“Good,” said I. Carrying the 
collector carefully in one hand, I 
went up the landing leg to the air- 
lock. Eric let me in. 

I peeled off my frosting suit in 
the blessed artificial light of ship’s 
day. 

“Okay,” said Eric. “Take it up 



to the lab. And don’t touch it.” 

Eric can be a hell* of an annoying 
character. “Eve got a brain,” I 
snarled, “even if you can’t see it.” 
So can I. 

There was a ringing silence while 
we each tried to dream up an 
apology. Eric got there first. “Sor- 
ry,” he said. 

“Me too.” I hauled the collector 
off to the lab on a cart. 

He guided me when 1 got there. 
“Put the whole package in that 
opening. Jaws first. No, don’t close 
it yet. Turn the thing until these 
lines match the lines on the collec- 
tor. Okay. Push it in a little. Now 
close the door. Okay, Howie, I’ll 
take it from there ...” There were 
chugging sounds from behind the 
little door. “Have to wait ’til the 
lab’s cool enough. Go get some 
coffee,” said Eric. 

“I’d better check your mainten- 
ance.” 

“Okay, good. Go oil my prosthe- 
tic aids.” 

‘Prosthetic aids’ — that was a hot 
one. I’d thought it up myself. I 
pushed the coffee button so it would 
be ready when I was through, then 
opened the big door in the forward 
wall of the cabin. Eric looked much 
like an electrical network, except for 
the gray mass at the top which was 
his brain. In all directions from 
his spinal cord and brain, connected 
at the walls of the intricately shaped 
glass-and-soft-plastic vessel which 
housed him, Eric’s nerves reached 
out to master the ship. The instru- 
ments which mastered Eric — but he 
was sensitive about having it put 
that way — were banked along boA

sides of the closet. The blood pump 
pumped rhythmically, seventy beats 
a minute. 

‘‘How do I look?” Eric asked. 

“Beautiful. Are you looking for 
flatteiy?” 

“Jackass! Am I still alive?” 

“The instruments think so. But 
I’d better lower your fluid temper- 
ature a fraction.” I did. Ever since 
we’d landed I’d had a tendency to 
keep temperatures too high. “Every- 
thing else looks okay. Except your 
food tank is getting low.” 

“Well, it’ll last the trip.” 

“Yeah. ’Scuse me, Eric, coffee’s 
ready.” I went and got it. The only 
thing I really worry about is his 
liver. It’s too complicated. It could 
break down too easily. If it stopped 
making blood sugar Eric would be 
dead. 

If Eric dies I die, because Eric 
is the ship. If I die Eric dies, insane, 
because he can’t sleep unless I set 
his prosthetic aids. 

I was finishing my coffee when 
Eric yelled. “Hey!” 

“What’s wrong?” I was ready to 
run in any direction. 

“It’s only helium!” 

He was astonished and indignant. 
I relaxed. 

“I get it now, Howie. Helium 
two. That’s all our monsters are. 
Nuts.” 

Helium two, the superfluid that 
flows uphill. “Nuts doubled. Hold 
everything, Eric. Don’t throw away 
your samples. Check them for con- 
taminants.” 

“For what?” 

“Contaminants. My body is hy- 



drogen oxide with contaminants. If 
the contaminants in the helium are 
complex enough it might be alive.” 
“There are plenty of other sub- 
stances,” said Eric, “but I can’t an- 
alyze them well enough. We’ll 
have to rush this stuff back to Earth 
while our freezers can keep it cool.” 
I got up. “Take off right now?” 
“Yes, I guess so. We could use 
another sample, blit we’re just as 
likely to wait here while this one 
deteriorates.” 

“Okay, I’m strapping down now. 
Eric?” 

“Yeah? Take off in fifteen min- 
utes, we have to wait for the ion- 
drive section. You can get up.” 
“No, ril wait. Eric, I hope it 
isn’t alive. I’d rather it was just 
helium two acting like its supposed 
to act.” 

“Why? Don’t you want to be 
famous, like me?” 

“Oh, sure, but I hate to think of 
life out there. It’s just too alien. 
Too cold. Even on Pluto you could 
not make life out of helium two.” 
“It could be migrant, moving to 
stay on the night side of the pre- 
dawn crescent. Pluto’s day is long 
enough for that. You’re right, 
though; it doesn’t get colder than 
this even between the stars. Luckily 
I don’t have much imagination.” 
Twenty minutes later we took off. 
Beneath us all was darkness and only 
Eric, hooked into the radar, could 
see the ice dome contracting until 
all of it was visible: the vast lay- 
ered ice cap that covers the coldest 
spot in the solar system, where mid- 
night crosses the equator on the 
black back of Mercury. END

Everyone knew no good would 
come of digging UP. Turned 
out that everyone was righti 



I 

F or the last month before Ascen- 
sion Day there was only one 
topic in Gallery 71. But there were 
53,000 different opinions to be ex- 
pressed. 

“The date is wrong,” said old 
Modin uneasily. “I’m sure the date 



is wrong. It should be fifty yean 
from now, or a hundred years from 
now, or two hundred. If this is the 
first possible safe date in two hun- 
dred years, obviously three hundred 
would be safer. Or four hundred. Or 
five hundred.” 

“Ascension Day!” said Loret skep- 
tically, at a different time and in 



different company, for she was six- 
teen and interested in nothing that 
was not male, or fun, orj^oth. 
“What’s supposed to happen, for 
heaven’s sake! What’s special about 
digging upwards! When you dig up 
or down or sidewise, what do you 
ever find except rock and shale and 
stones and sometimes a spring? 
What’s supposed to happen when 
we dig up from Tunnel 17 terminus, 
for heaven’s sake? Why don’t we 
just have a holiday and a festival on 
Ascension Day, and forget the whole 
crazy idea of digging upwards, for 
heaven’s sake?” 

In the Council, Sim went further. 
“Surely,” he said in his dry, rather 
pedantic voice, “the conception of 
digging upward is symbolic. Two 
centuries ago the Founders set a 
day for our thoughts, wishes and 
aspirations to turn upwards to high- 
er, better things. The pasage of 
time, the distortion of ritual, has 
turned an abstract idea into a con- 
crete one.” 

Also at a Council meeting, old 
Zet said: “Doesn’t the idea come 
from some two-hundred-year-old fig- 
ure of speech which has struck? Like 
•when cows fly’ or ‘once in a blue 
moon’? I think so. What’s a ‘blue 
moon’ supposed to be? I guess the 
truth is that someone said once: 
‘We’ll dig upwards in two hundred 
years,’ intending to convey that no- 
body would ever dig upwards at all. 
Well, who but an idiot ever dug 
above his head? You’re liable to 
bury yourself in stones, and what’s 
the use of a vertical tunnel to no- 
where anyway? Naturally when we 
want more space we dig horizontal- 



ly. Multiple levels on top of one 
another merely raise scores of quite 
difficult and unnecessary engineering 
problems.” 

Sinn, who talked a lot, naturally 
had more than one go at Ascension 
Day. “I am certain there is no more 
than religious significance in the 
tradition. The warning runs: Be^ 
ware the fire which sears the flesh. 
If it still burns, return to the Gal-- 
lery at once and close the shaft for 
another hundred years. Now I can 
quote from old books to show that 
Ascension Day is mentioned by 
name in an ancient religion of a 
whatever that’s supposed to mean. 
God who created heaven and earth, 
However, the meaning of our tra- 
dition is clear: Turn your thoughts 
upwards, and beware the fires of 
hell.” 

Modin, too, had another crack at 
it. “Something terrible will happen 
if we ever dig up from Tunnel 17 
ers knew about it. Perhaps there’s a 
terminus,” he warned. “The Found- 
vast sprint up there. Maybe once 
it’s breached it can never be 
dartifned. What the legends mean is: 
Dig upwards at your peril. When 
you do, that will be the end of Gal- 
ley 71.” 

But despite the fears of old Mo- 
din, the angry indifference of Loret 
(who wanted all the attention that 
was going and believed she had 
every right to get it), the pedantic 
skepticism of Sinn and the practical, 
down-to-earth objections of Zet, the 
general opinion was that of Sello, 
the Premier. 

Sello expressed the view simply: 
“There’s a clear direction. At such 



AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD 



45 




and such a date, at a certain place, 
dig upwards for five thousand feet. 
That’s exactly what we’re going to 
do. Why not? The Founders believed 
it was to our advantage to do so. 
If we find it’s not, we’ll fill in the 
hole again.” 

So matters stood until, just a week 
before Ascension Day, Sinn died. 
And the very next day, Modin died. 

Those who believed in signs had 
a field day. Modin was old, true, but 
Sinn was not. That the two princi- 
pal opponents of Ascension Day 
should die just before it might have 
been taken as a sign that the 
Founders’ instructions must be car- 
ried out literally. But the supersti- 
tious insisted on taking it the other 
way. To them, Sinn and Modin were 
prophets. Their deaths suddenly and 
dramatically increase the value and 
truth of their last statements. 

G allery 71 was a warm, well- 
planned hive housing 53,000 
people in luxury. For twelve hours 
at a time the pale gray sky, fully 
twenty feet above the floor, was 
brightly lit. For the next twelve, 
only a faint gleam enabled those 
who had to be out by night to find 
their way about. 

The wide avenues, with their mas- 
sive central pillars, were flanked by 
houses (houses, not cells) neatly 
inserted in the rock. Every fifty 
yards an air vent sighed softly. 

There was no transport system, 
although the question of providing 
one was considered every few years. 
It was sometimes necessary to walk 
several miles. But cattlemen were 
housed near the cattle, fishmongers 



near the stock pools, builders near 
the present construction site. “Some 
peopleware flabby enough as it is,” 
Sello commented caustically when 
the question came up again. And 
once more the provision of a regu- 
lar service of trains, trams, buses 
or cars was turned down. 

There were plenty of sports 
grounds and swimming pools. Cen- 
trally placed was a dog track. There 
was no great demand for further 
facilities, since no one in Gallery 71 
was overburdened with leisure. 

There was always plenty of work 
to be done. Every structure in the 
Gallery had to be regularly checked 
and overhauled- — occasional minor 
disasters were sufficient reminder of 
this. And the fact that neither prop- 
erty nor money could be willed to 
descendants ensured that nobody 
was ever relieved of the necessity ot 
having to work for a living. 

Gallery 71 was not paradise. It 
was a moderately contented com- 
munity, entirely self-supporting, 
peaceable, law-abiding. It had to be 
law-abiding, for in a closed com- 
munity crime was a waste of time. 
You couldn’t take the risk of seri- 
ously offending society when there 
was literally nowhere to go. And 
few crimes ever went unsolved. It 
would always be taken for granted 
that the criminal had not skipped 
town. 

However, as Ascension Day ap- 
proached, the Gallery became slight- 
ly less law-abiding and considerably 
less peaceful. Ascension Day was 
such a big and obviously important 
thing that as the date came closer 
there was increasing unrest in the 

IF 



46 




Gallery. People took sides and tem- 
pers were lost. 

The two sides were obvious. To 
dig or not to dig, that was the ques- 
tion. The issues were fairly obvious 

too. 

PRO: We’re supposed to dig and 
we’re going to dig. What have we 
to lose? If we don’t find anything or 
we don’t like what we find, that’s 
too bad. But suppose we do find 
something and do like what we 
find? 

CONTRA: We’re fine the way 
we are. What more do we want! 
We’ve nothing to gain and every- 
thing to lose. Two hundred years 
ago, when Ascension Day was set, 
Gallery 71 must have been a tiny, 
^mp, overcrowded, uncomfortable 
cavern. Look at it now. What else 
do we need! Nothing. Nothing at 
all. 

n 

T T^hen Aleta came home on the 
▼ ▼ eve of Ascension Day to 
change out of her working clothes, 
she found her father looking un- 
usually grave. 

Sello was a stocky man of forty- 
five, a bmlder. As Premier he was 
the final arbiter in Gallery 71, but 
he had a job like everybody else. 
The GoUty pay he received as Pre- 
mier was an allowance to bring up 
his earnings .to what he would have 
received as a builder if his other 
duties, did not make demands on 
his time. 

“Aleta,” he said, “you and Sep 
mean to go to the rally tonight, 
don’t you?” 



She nodded and asked, “Why?” 

“It would be better if you didn’t 
»» 
go. 

She showed her surprise. “We’re 
not taking sides. Pop, only going 
along to see what happens. What’s 
the harm in that?” 

“No harm. But — ” 

He looked at her for several se- 
conds. She was eighteen, and even 
in her dusty overall (she was a 
Sander) a very pretty girl. She had 
red hair and a neat, small-scale 
figure, exquisitely rounded. 

Sello knew he was lucky to have a 
child at all, in a community where 
population control was so rigidly 
enforced. He was ten times luckier 
to have such a child as Aleta — ^beau- 
tiful, contented, intelligent, warm- 
hearted. He could honestly say that 
if he had been granted the oppor- 
tunity of drawing up the complete 
specifications for his daughter, she 
would have been exactly like Aleta. 
To add to all this, she had the 
sense to attract and be attracted by 
young Sep, a probable future Pre- 
mier and exactly the son-in-law Sel- 
lo would have chosen. 

“There’s going to be trouble at 
the rally,” Sello said at last. “It 
may get out of hand. People will 
be hurt.” 

“Surely not. Pop?” said Aleta. 
“I know there have been fights 
already, but nothing very serious. 
What does fighting prove? If you’re 
stronger than another man, does 
that prove what you believe is right 
and what he believes is wrong?” 

“I know that, Aleta. But do the 
people who will be at the rally 
know it?” 



48 



IF 




She smiled. “Anyway, Sep can 
look after me.” 

Sello still looked doubtful. “The 
old books talk of mobs and mob 
law. We’ve never had a mob before. 
We don’t know what it’s liable to 
do.” 

Aleta laughed. “Pop, you’re mak- 
ing it more and more impossible for 
me to stay away from the rally. 
But we’ll be careful.” 

She went to her bedroom to 
change. Having had her meals on 
the job, she merely had to wash and 
change before going out. 

Since there were no drones in the 
Gallery, since everyone spent most 
of every day except Sunday in 
working clothes, there had long been 
a tacit agreement that if you judged 
people by what they wore, you did 
so only in their leisure hours. Work- 
ing clothes didn’t even resemble 
leisure clothes. During the day you 
wore what your work demanded. 
In the evening you wore something 
as different from this as possible. 

Aleta chose a green and orange 
outfit provocative in its utter im- 
practicality. Her orange blouse had 
double vertical ruffles at front and 
back; her wide green skirt swung 
from the hips over an orange 
sheath, ankle-length, which made 
walking' close to impossible. She 
wore white high-heeled shoes and 
white gloves. 

In a constant warmth which made 
semi-nudity comfortable, fashion ran 
to concealment. Semi-nudity in pub- 
lic was common but never fashion- 
able. Girls wore a halter and shorts 
for games or for work; to be 
dressed, they went to the other ex- 



treme. Men labored stripped to the' 
waist, but when they went on the 
town they wore black dress suits. 

Sep called for Aleta as smartly 
dressed as she was. His black trou- 
sers were knife-creased, his gray 
jacket spotless. 

They ribbed one another easily. 
“I know it’s only a rally, but 
shouldn’t you have changed out of 
your working clothes!” Sep said. 

“I didn’t want to show you up,” 
Aleta retorted. 

A s they walked to the dog track, 
the noise came and hit them. 
The only time they had heard such 
shouting before was when a parti- 
cularly exciting dog race was being 
run. But this was different — the 
shouting was jagged, angry, irregular. 

Aleta remembered Sello’s warn- 
ing and hesitated momentarily. But 
Sep, curious to see what was going 
on, was hurrying. Even without stop- 
ping she had the greatest difficulty 
in keeping up with him. 

They didn’t get near the 
track. They turned a corner and 
stopped, stunned by what they saw. 

Perhaps seventy people were en- 
gaged in the scuffle. At first it 
seemed no more than a scuffle — 
but as Aleta looked round, her 
gaze swung back incredulously to 
a doorway in which three young 
men were battering two older men’s 
heads viciously against the closed 
door. 

Sep saw this too, and started to 
Tun. But in a moment he stopped. 
It was suddenly obvious that what 
they had seen was not the worst 
thing going on in the melee. 



AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD 



49 




About a dozen people, men and 
women, had linked arms and were 
trampling a line of squirming bodies. 
Three youths with sticks were beat- 
ing a couple of girls. A huge man 
sitting on the stomach of his help- 
less victim was clouting him on the 
head: left, right, left, right, left, 
right. 

There were shouts and screams 
and moans and entreaties. There 
was no sense in the scene; it was 
like a montage of the most violent, 
savage episodes from a dozen dif- 
ferent horror films, all scrambled 
together. 

There was no sense in the con- 
flict either. What had probably start- 
ed as a disagreement over the clear 
issues of Ascension Day had become 
a riot, an orgy of sadism, a goulash 
of blood lust. 

Sep and Aleta had time for only 
a brief, incredulous glance at the 
mad violence in the street. Then a 
fat man cannoned into Aleta and 
she staggered back against a wall. 
The next moment a red-eyed rooter 
reached out and grabbed her bodice, 
together with a good deal of her 
flesh, and wrenched savagely. The 
flesh withstood the assault but the 
blouse did not. Most' of it came 
away in the man’s hand. 

The next moment Sep had wheeled 
him round and hit him on the chin. 
He staggered back, but a friend of 
his jumped Sep from behind. Watch- 
ing Sep, Aleta didn’t know whether 
she was struck deliberately or acci- 
dentally, or by whom. Anyway, she 
sprawled full length on her side, 
and someone kicked her. 

Vaguely she was aware that she 



must have been recognized, that thii 
was happening to her simply be- 
cause she was the daughter of the 
Premier. 

Suddenly Sep was with her again, 
dragging her to her feet. There was 
a cut on his cheek. “Run!” he 
gasped. 

She laughed hysterically. Run, in 
the sheath she was wearing? 

Sep bent and ripped it open. As 
he did so another rioter came up 
behind Aleta. Still bent double, Sep 
butted him in the stomach with 
his head. 

Aleta ran. They both ran, not 
looking back. They ran right back 
to Sello’s house, and slammed the 
door behind them. 

E verybody assumed Ascension 
Day would be postponed while 
the riot was probed. There was no 
such episode in recorded history. 
The Gallery was frightened, asham- 
ed, grief-stricken, defiant. 

But Sello got the digging started 
before he even began to deal with 
the rioters. Delay would only make 
more time available for further 
strife. Once the digging was under 
way. Ascension Day was officially 
inaugurated a fait accompli. 

So with Sep in charge, a drilling 
gang began the long operation (it 
was expected to take a month). 
Fifty men stood by in case of fur- 
ther riots. 

There were none. The rally riot 
had shocked the whole Gallery 
out of further demonstration. 

It was assumed that Sello would 
call a full Council meeting to discuss 
what action should be taken. This 



50 



IF 




was another assumption which prove 
false. 

Sello dealt with the rioters as 
ordinary criminals. He recognized 
nothing out of the ordinary in the 
circumstances. He dealt with the 
identified rioters as if each of their 
crimes had been committed in a 
vacuum. And in the small, closed 
community, most of them were iden- 
tified. 

Seven men and two women had 
died. Eighty-four were injured. The 
seven murderers (two killed twice) 
were tried first, found guilty and 
executed. It was in this atmosphere 
of summary justice that the hun- 
dreds of other charges were ex- 
amined. 

Although Sello was at first 
strongly criticized, his handling of 
the affair was eventually applauded. 
There had been a feeling that since 
the riot was a special case, special 
measures would have to be invented 
to deal with it. Most people not in- 
volved had felt that it was out of the 
question to try so many offenders 
in the usual way; many even felt that 
the riot should be passed over al- 
most as if it had never happened. 

Sello’s attitude from the very be- 
ginning was that a mob had no 
special privilege to assault life and 
limb. Strong conviction was no ex- 
cuse for murder. In the trials, As- 
scension Day was not even men- 
tioned. The only question was, who 
had done what? 

Ordinary houses had to be con- 
verted into jails. Sello, a politi- 
cian in the final reckoning, knew 
that few of the sentences which he 
and other judges passed would be 



completed. However, the essential 
thing was that justice should be 
swift and decisive. Nothing like the 
Ascension Eve Riot must ever hap- 
pen again. 

Most of the men and women on 
trial were dazed, incredulous. They 
could scarcely believe that they had 
done what they had done, and they 
were sure they would not be heavily 
punished. They trusted in the com- 
mon, familiar human defense: 
/ wasn't the only one. He was doing 
it too. 

This availed them nothing. The 
others who were doing it too came 
up in court later. 

And gradually even the men given 
the stiffest sentences accepted the 
justice of it all. Mad they might 
have been — they were being pun- 
ished for what they had done. Not 
for what they had thought nor what 
they intended: what they had done. 

All the time the trials were going 
on (507 men and women on 1743 
charges), Sep^s digging party bored 
upwards, stowing the surplus rock 
in long-prepared shafts. After the 
seventh day the work suddenly be- 
came very easy. Instead of the hard 
rock which was encountered in al- 
most all digging operations, Sep 
struck soft, dry soil which could 
be drilled ten times as fast as it 
could be carried away. 

It was useful, this soil. A great 
deal of it went to the gardeners, 
who had never had enough before. 
Now flower-beds were planted all 
over the Gallery. 

Few of the Ascension Eve Riot 
trials were long or complicated. 
Most of the rioters pleaded guilty;

the> knew what they had done, and 
they knew the evidence against them. 

The last riot trial was concluded 
on another eve — the eve of attain- 
ment of five thousand feet. 

Ill 

A leta spent the evening at home 
with her father. Sep was usually 
too tired to do anything but sleep 
when he finished work. 

She watched Sello without speak- 
ing for a long time. Only she knew 
that Sello was not a cold, implaca- 
ble judge, that the death penalties 
he had passed and the centuries of 
jail sentences had taken years off 
his own life. 

At last, since he clearly wasn’t 
going to speak, she said: “What do 
you think Sep will find. Pop?” 

He looked up. “Perhaps another 
Gallery,” he said. “This is Gallery 
71, remember.” 

The idea came as a revelation to 
Aleta. Such a possibility had never 
been discussed, although now it 
was presented to her it seemed 
suddenly obvious. 

Gallery 71 — that was the name of 
the world. Its inhabitants did not 
consider the possibility of other Gal- 
leries partly because in two cen- 
turies of carefully planned ex- 
pansion they had never found any- 
thing to suggest that other Galleries 
existed. Certainly 71 was a number, 
yet it never crossed anyone’s mind 
that there might be seventy other 
Galleries, or even more, all with 
people in them — different, unknown 
people, in different, unknown Gal- 
leries. 



“Yes,” she said slowly, thought- 
fully. “Yes, I suppose that’s possible. 
What made you think of it. Pop?” 

“The same thing that made mo 
enforce Ascension Day. The thing 
that showed me how distorted his- 
tory can become.”. 

Aleta was surprised. He never 
talked of history, or possible distor- 
tion in it. 

“When my father was alive, he 
often told me about the body,” Sel- 
lo said quietly. 

“What body?” 

“A party digging off Tunnel 3 
struck a spring. In it they found the 
body of a man. A recent body, dead 
only a matter of days. Not the body 
of anyone from Gallery 71.” 

He paused. Aleta saw the signi- 
ficance at once. “Why, that means 
. But tell me, when was this? 
And why have I never heard about 
it?” 

Sello nodded, an unspoken ques^ 
tion answered. “You understand, 
Aleta. YouTe intelligent, and not 
afraid to face the truth, even if it^s 
different from what you expect. But 
not everybody is like you.” 

H e looked beyond her into space. 

“This happened only seventy 
years ago — in the lifetime of quite 
a few people still alive. The man 
was found, and the significance was 
undeniable. This was not the only 
Gallery . But time passed, and be- 
lief became strained. This is the 
world. There is nothing else, noth- 
ing but rock. When we dig, we never 
find anything but rock and stones 
and shale and sometimes soil. The 
spring off Tunnel 3 was sealed off. 



52 



IF 




bypassed. The body was cremated. 
And ten years later, already hardly 
anyone believed that a body had 
been found. Or if it had been found, 
it came from this Gallery.” 

“Is it possible?” Aleta said 
thoughtfully. 

“It’s possible. The men who had 
actually found the body died, one 
after another, until only my father 
was left. The records in the library 
were questioned, disbelieved and fin- 
ally destroyed. There could have 
been no strange body, because this 
is Gallery 71, this is the Gallery. 
It must have been a trick, a joke, 
a hoax. You see?” 

Aleta wasn’t sure that she did see. 

“I’ve always remembered,” Sello 
went on, “that in the Gallery the 
truth is what people believe. At 
least, what people believe is all that 
can survive. I’m not a great reader, 
few of us are — but when you go to 
the library, when you read the 
records, you find* that before a cer- 
tain time nothing exists, and that 
after that time all that remains is 
what we believe now.” 

Aleta wasn’t entirely convinced. 
“We have a great respect for tradi- 
tion, Pop. Surely we pay too much 
attention to old legends, warnings 
and ritual, rather than too little?” 

“Attention, yes. Veneration, yes. 
Real respect, no. Rather than believe 
that what the Founders said was 
exactly what they meant, we’ve been 
changing it around to suit ourselves 
for two centuries. Like Sinn in the 
Council ... I wish he’d had the 
consideration to live for another 
couple of weeks instead of becoming 
a martyr . The Founders’ warning 



about Ascension Day comes down to 
us like this: Beware the fire which 
sears the flesh. If it still burns, re- 
turn to the Gallery at once and 
close the shaft for another hundred 
years'^ 

He shook his head. “I wonder 
what they really said.” 

“You don’t believe they said 
that?” 

“I believe they said something 
much more definite and specific. 
But generations of librarians have 
turned it gradually into something 
vague and mystical. Another thing 
I don’t believe is that the world 
began two hundred years ago with 
the Founders. I don’t think they 
meant us to believe it, either. But 
maybe it doesn’t matter.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because the important thing did 
survive. The definite instruction to 
dig upwards for five thousand feet.” 
“So you believe . .?” 

“I believe that tomorrow, soon 
after drilling starts, we’ll know the 
answers to questions we can’t even 
ask now, because we don’t know 
enough to ask them.” 

n this Sello proved correct. 

It was still early morning when 
Sep sent for Sello. Aleta had not 
even left for work. Sep’s message 
was so startling that she didn’t go 
at all. 

“On a day of such significance,” 
Sello declared, forgetting for a mo- 
ment that he was talking to his 
daughter and not addressing a meet- 
ing of the Council, “What happens 
five thousand feet up is five thou- 
sand times more important than 



AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD 



53 




anything that may happen in the 
Gallery.” 

So Aleta went with him. They 
had to walk to Tunnel 17 terminus. 
There they found a crude but effi- 
cient elevator which took them up 
the five thousand feet. They emer- 
ged on a landing stage and entered 
a second elevator. 

The last five thousand feet they 
had to climb. At the top they found 
Sep and his men crowded in a small 
tunnel off the vertical shaft. There 
was a strange silence among them. 

“What’s happened!” Sello asked. 

“It’s impossible to explain,” Sep 
said quietly. “You’ll have to look for 
yourself.” 

‘Ts there danger?” 

“That’s another thing you’ll have 
to decide for yourself. I’ve fitted a 
valve just above this tunnel, anyway. 
It can be closed at any time.” 

Sep climbed up the ladder first, 
then Sello, then Aleta. Even up 
here, Sello noted, the shaft was 
neatly, strongly lined with stone- 
dust bricks. Sep could be relied on 
to do a good job, cutting no corn- 
ers. ’ 

They passed through the valve, 
closed it behind them and climbed 
up into a blaze of light. 

For the two men and the girl 
green valley under the early morn- 
ing sun was a terrifying experience. 
Although ■ the light was not too 
bright for them, the illumination in 
the Gallery being strong, they could 
scarcely see. Their eyes could not 
accommodate themselves to the dis- 
tances involved, to the strangely 
bright colors, to the fantastic, un- 
known shapes. 



Actually, had they known it, in 
this small valley none of the dis- 
tances, even to the tops of the sur- 
rounding hills was long as surface 
distances went. But to people who 
knew nothing outside Gallery 71, a 
mile of unrestricted vision repre- 
sented vastness beyond belief. 

Nobody said anything. After a 
few minutes they began to lose their 
fear that they would fall upwards in- 
to the empty sky. This was a strange, 
irrational terror. Nobody had ever 
fallen upwards in the Gallery. Yet 
the roof over their heads, so close, 
so solid, had come to be a psycholo- 
gical necessity. Without it, they were 
afraid of a thousand unimaginable 
things. It was a protection, it was 
sanity. 

At last Sello spoke. “I don’t like it 
I fought for this moment, for this 
vision, and now that it’s been achiev- 
ed I wonder if Sinn and Modin 
were right.” 

“This is a wonderful place,” Sep 
protested. 

“Yes . Hell, too, would be a 
wonderful place.” 

“Now that we’ve found it we must 
try to find out — ” 

“Oh, yes,” Sello interrupted with 
a sigh. “We must certainly try to 
find out. We have no choice, now. 
Aleta, are you afraid?” 

They were all afraid, yet some- 
how she knew exactly what ho 
meant. He meant, was she so awed 
by the revelation and its implica- 
tions that she had to go straight 
back to the Gallery at once, or 
could she stay out here in this 
vast, terrifying Gallery and even 
explore it if necessary? 



54 



IF 




“I’ll stay,” she said. “If you want 
me too.” 

“Good.” He didn’t want her to 
stay, he wanted to take her back 
with him. But he had already made 
up his mind that a representative 
group must make some acquain- 
tance with this world (a world of 
which, he had already begun to sus- 
pect, Gallery 71 was only a tiny and 
insignificant part). As Premier, he 
could not permit himself to lead this 
group. His responsibility was to the 
Gallery. 

However, since in the event of 
anything going seriously wrong — and 
it was obvious that many things 
could go wrong in such a strange, 
utterly unknown environment — peo- 
ple would be liable to say that he 
had made others do what he would 
not do himself, he knew Aleta had 
to be a member of the party. There 
was scarcely a choice. 

Carefully he explained his plan. 
This great new Gallery could not be 
ignored. It existed. More must be 
found out about it. 

So a representative group of thirty 
volunteers would stay up here for 
a day or more, cautiously finding 
out . whatever there was to 
find out. 

“Will you take, charge, Sep?” Sel- 
lo asked. 

“Of course.” 

“YoU' must . Sello stopped 
himself. It was no good putting a 
man in charge of a party testing a 
new, utterly unknown environment 
and in the next breath weighing 
him down with orders, even with ad- 
vice. 

In the end Sello confined himself 



to a platitude so vague that it could 
not be a burden: “Be careful, Sep.* 

IV 

T hey climbed out of the hole in 
the ground and hesitated in 
awe, one after the other. Afterwards 
they confessed that each one of 
them experienced that strange fear 
of falling upwards into the infinite 
blue sky. 

Several of them hurt their eyes 
staring at the sun. But no serious 
damage was done — nobody was stu- 
pid enough to go on doing anything 
so painful simply because he had 
never seen anything like the sun be- 
fore. « 

They had no name for the sun. 
The word “sun” had survived in 
their language in such phrases as “a 
place in the sun,” “sunny-tempered” 
and “nothing new under the sun,” 
but no one guessed that this was the 
sun. They talked of it as a light or 
a lamp. 

Most of them were young, the 
young being the most curious, the 
most fearless and the readiest^ to 
volunteer. Loret was among them, 
with some of her gang of admirers. 
Although she had thought and said 
Ascension Day was nonsense, she 
was as ready as anyone to partici- 
pate in any exciting developments 
there might be. She was not old 
enough to care on Wednesday about 
anything she might have said on 
Monday. 

Despite the initial awe, the early 
fears, in a few minutes everybody 
was laughing and chattering. Soon 
some of the youngsters began to

55 




show otf, demonstrating their brav- 
ery and their unconcern about the 
miracle before their eyes. 

“Wait,” Sep called. “Listen, all 
ot you. First, nobody gets out of 
sight of the shaft, understood! We 
may have to go back at any mo- 
ment. There may be dangers in 
this world we^know nothing about — 
huge animals, poisonous vapor, fire, 
flood, a hundred other things we 
can’t begin to imagine. We may even 
have to close the shaft behind us. 
Anybody who’s wandered off may 
be left behind.” 

The threat brought shocked si- 
lence, and involuntarily the group 
closed up. 

• “Another thing,” Sep said. “This 
ground looks okay, but it may be 
treacherous. You find yourself slip- 
ping into holes. We’re used to level 
ground, and this isn’t level. So watch 
out, all of you.” 

And for a few minutes they 
watched out. But as nothing unto- 
ward happened, the group spread 
out again, brave v/nce more. 

It was now possible to make out 
things which had been obscure at 
first. When Sello, Aleta and Sep 
around them, they had discovered 
for the first time that the eye and 
brain had great trouble interpreting 
the unknown. The mountain behind 
them, a vast black, towering shape, 
had been difficult to see clearly. 
The brain behind the eye told the 
eye to look again, to send impres- 
sions that made more sense. 

Gradually they realized that Gal- 
lery 71 had been deliberately placed 
under that mountain. That the ter- 
minus of Tunnel 17 was directly be- 



low almost the lowest part of the 
valley, so that the shaft to the sur- 
face was shortest there. 

Almost, not quite. For three hun- 
dred yards further on there was a 
tiny lake. Even to the inexperienced 
Galleryites, this was clearly the true 
bottom of the valley. 

They stared at the lake, all ol 
them, not quite understanding what 
it was. Water, certainly. At least it 
looked like water. But so much 
water? Was there so much water in 
the world? 

And the color was unexpected. 
It was black, blue, gray, green, blue, 
brown. They had never seen water 
in quantity except in a pool or 
tank. And it rippled as if it were 
alive. 

Loret laughed suddenly. “It’s hot,” 
she said. ‘‘Let’s take off our clothes.” 

At first only Loret threw off her 
clothes, and only a few outer gar- 
ments at that. Presently, however, 
there began to seem something es- 
sentially right about taking off their 
clothes in this open world. It was 
not merely because it was hot and 
the sun was pleasant on their skin. 
It was also a feeling of freedom, of 
spaciousness, of newness. 

In the Gallery certain convviitixrtis 
were observed. But this was outside 
the Gallery. This was a new place, a 
wonderful, fantastic place where no 
rules applied until new rule§ were 
made. 

Why, there wasn’t even anything 
to fall on them. There was nothing 
that could fall on them. This was 
only gradually realized — what at 
first had seemed frightening began, 
only a short time later, to seem a 



56 



IF 





marvellous new freedom. You could 
play games, shout, stamp on the 
ground, do anything you liked with- 
out fear that you’d start a roof fall. 

When most of the other took off 
their outer clothes, Loret stripped 
to a red bathing suit. Only she had 
thought to bring a bathing suit, 
possibly because, knowing how she 
looked in it, she never missed any 
opportunity to wear it. 

‘‘I wish Pd brought mine,” an- 
other girl said, looking at Loret 
jealously. ‘‘But it’s too far to go all 
the way back for it.” 

“You can have mine if you like,” 
said Loret recklessly, jumping up an 
stripping it off. 

S tartled by her daring, the boys 
and girls with her looked at 
Sep. But he did and said nothing. 

AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD 



The next moment half a dozen of 
them stripped naked, leaping and 
dancing on the grass like children. 

“I wonder if there’s something 
different in the air up here?” Aleta 
murmured to Sep. “Don’t you feel 
it?” 

He nodded. “Quite possibly. More 
oxygen, less carbon dioxide. That 
would account for it.” 

“Harmful, do you think?” 

“No, I guess not. We may tire 
ourselves out more, that’s all.” 

“I feel like stripping and dancing 
too.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“No, I can’t. Pm the Premier’s 
daughter, remember? You could, 
you’re nothing in particular.” 

Sep grinned and threw small stone 
at her. 

Despite Sep’s sober warnings, 

57 






nothing untoward happened. They 
saw plenty of insects but no animals. 
The ground was firm and safe. Run- 
ning on it was delightful, and falls 
proved laughably harmless compared 
with falls on rock or concrete. 

It took them an hour or two to 
get around to swimming in the lake. 
Several of them had thought about 
it much earlier, but didn’t say any- 
thing in case they should be forced 
to prove their courage by diving in. 

It was Loret, of course, who 
eventually suggested it. Still nude, 
she sat on the edge first and dangled 
her toes in the water, shrieking at 
the cold. A few minutes later, never- 
theless, she was in the water, shout- 
ing that it wasn’t so cold once you 
were in. Cautiously a few of her 
entourage followed her. 

Sep had considered forbidding 
bathing or at least delivering warn- 
ings. There might be dangerous 
creatures in the lake, which looked 
very deep, and who could tell what 
other perils there might be? 

In the end he said nothing, for the 
whole experiment as he saw it was 
aimed at finding out as much as 
possible about this vast external 
world. Very little would be found 
out if he forbade everything. 

The bathers emerged, shivering. 
But the sun was now so hot, high 
overhead, that in a few minutes they 
were so warm that they were ready 
to swim again. 

Around midday they ate the food 
they had brought with them. Most of 
them were so hungry that they ate 
at one sitting all they had brought 
to last them all day. 

After lunch four of the men 



crossed the valley floor to the 
nearest hill. The lower slopes pre- 
sented no difficulty, but presently 
they reached a rock face which, to 
inexperienced climbers, looked quite 
unscaleable. Skirting it for several 
hundred yards, they found no place 
where they could climb more than 
twenty feet higher. 

They were not surprised. The 
valley seemed so vast to all the 
people from the Gallery that it oc- 
curred to no one that it was merely 
a tiny part of an immense continent. 
It seemed quite natural that the 
hills which surrounded the valley 
should be unclimbable, enclosing it 
as decisively as the walls of Gal- 
lery 71 bounded it. 

They descended and reported to 
Sep, who was as unsurprised as they 
were. He, too, had not tried to pro- 
ject his thoughts beyond the valley. 

In the middle of the afternoon, 
Aleta, who had sat quietly with 
others, finally succumbed to temp- 
tation and stripped to her briefs. 
She dived in the lake, swam right 
across and back, and climbed out, 
shaking the water from her hair. 

There was a murmur of slightly 
reluctant admiration. No one else 
had managed to swim right across. 
Loret stared at her in unconcealed 
dislike. In her view Aleta had de- 
liberately and maliciously stolen 
her thunder — as usual. 

I t was shortly after this that 
Sello climbed to the exit once 
more to see for himself what was 
going on. He stared in shocked dis- 
approval at Loret and her friends, 
all nude by this time. 



58 



IF 




Sep saw him and came to report 
to him. 

“You permitted this!” Sello said 
with a wave of his hand. 

Sep grinned. “I could hardly stop 
them. The air up here is intoxicat- 
ing. We haven’t a drop of alcohol 
with us, but you wouldn’t guess it 
from the things that have been going 
on — ” 

''What sort of things?” Sello de- 
manded quickly. 

"Oh, nothing much. Running, 
dancing, jumping, climbing, swim- 
min, wrestling — a few scrapes and 
scratches, but nobody’s hurt.” 

"Swimming? That pond? You let 
them?” 

“Aleta’s just swum across and 
back.” 

Sello clearly didn’t approve of the 
way Sep was handling things. His 
eyes widened as Aleta stood up and 
waved, scarcely more decent than 
Loret and her companions. 

However he had put Sep in 
charge. And the average age of the 
volunteers was less than twenty. He 
grunted and made a withdraw into 
the hole. 

“Wait,” said Sep. “Could you send 
up some more food? This air makes 
us very hungry.” 

“Are you sure it’s safe to stay 
here?” 

"Safe? Fve been thinking. Pre- 
mier. Isn’t it pretty clear that we 
all came from here originally? Be- 
fore we built the Gallery?” 

Evidently the same thought had 
already crossed Sello’s mind, for it 
was no surprise to him and he didn’t 
argue. “If so,” he said, “the Found- 
ers must have had a very good 



reason to withdraw to the Gallery 
and ensure that we stayed there 
for two centuries.” 

Sep nodded soberly. “I guess so.” 

“Any idea what it might be?” 
Sello asked. 

“No, not in the present condi- 
tions. But they may change.” 

"Change? How?” 

Sep pointed at the sun. “The lamp 
in the sky ... it moves. Soon it 
will be night.” 

“Like night in the Gallery? And 
at the same time?” 

Sep nodded “Not by coincidence 
either I guess our night and day are 
modelled on night and day here. I 
don’t know what night will be like 
here — except it’s almost certain to 
be very cold.” 

"Then come back to the Gallery 
when it’s night.” 

“You don’t want us to stay for the 
whole cycle?” 

"I want you to come back — and 
be examined.” 

“For what?” 

For the first time it was Sello 
who smiled. "We won’t know what 
we’re looking for until we find it, 
will we?” 

After Sello had climbed down the 
shaft again, Sep remained for some 
time where he was, frowning 
thoughtfully. Age obviously made a 
great difference to people’s reaction 
to this open Gallary. Sello, whom 
Sep had always considered wise and 
reasonably progressive, proved to be 
almost as reactionary as Sinn and 
Modin at sight of the valley. And 
Sello was not very old. 

Yet Sep and Aleta and Loret and 
the other volunteers, few of them 



AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD 



59 




beyond their teens, adapted easily 
and readily to these new condi- 
tions outside the Gallery. 

Perhaps it was a pity that the 
final decisions — ^whatever they might 
be — would be taken, as all impor- 
tant decisions were, by the elders 
of Gallery 71. 

V 

T hey sunbathed all day. But 
when the sun (which they were 
still calling a lamp) disappeared be- 
hind one of the hill-tops, the tem- 
perature dropped sharply. Within 
half an hour they all wore all the 
clothes they had with them and 
wanted more. 

In another half-hour it was so 
cold that Sep had to order withdraw- 
al to the Gallery. 

It was an order which was gladly 
obeyed. This new world was won- 
derful by day, but even before the 
last rays of the sun had disappeared 
it became terrifying again. 

Sep and Aleta stayed at the top 
of the shaft to see what happened 
when the lamp went out. The others 
hastened back to Gallery 71, eagerly 
anticipating the delights of describ- 
ing the wonders they had seen to the 
stay-at-homes. 

“There’s another bird,” Aleta said, 
pointing. 

They had seen plenty of birds 
without losing their wonder of them. 
Birds and flight were not entirely 
unknown to them — they had hens in 
the Gallery. The swooping, soaring 
birds of the valley showed, however, 
that hens had aH but forgotten how 
to fly. 



This was a beautiful silvery bird 
which circled the valley lazily, still 
in sunshine although the whole val- 
ley was in deep shadow. Presently 
it darted away and in a few min- 
utes night was complete. 

Aleta was shivering in Sep’s arms. 
They climbed down and closed the 
valve behind them, missing the won- 
der of the moon and stars. 

Next day all thirty of the volun- 
teers came out in a fiery rash. They 
lay in bed groaning, wincing at the 
touch of the lightest sheet. 

Some thought they were dying. 
Some feared they were not. Some 
had colds as well as the red rash: 
others had boils. 

There was no great mystery about 
the common ailment. The rash was 
clearly caused by burning. The burn- 
ing was clearly caused by the great 
lamp whose warmth had been so 
pleasant the day before. 

Sep and Aleta, who had sun- 
bathed moderately, were in better 
case than anyone else. Yet they 
were in such pain that they were 
not consulted when the emergency 
Council meeting called by the Pre- 
mier made its decision. 

^'Beware the fire that sears the 
flesh,'* Sello quoted grimly. ''If it 
still burns, return to the Gallery at 
once and close the shaft for another 
hundred years. Our duty is clear, 
Councillors.” 

“Yes,” said Zet with satisfaction. 
“I’m glad you agree. Premier.” And 
he couldn’t resist adding: “At last.” 

“We had to obey the Founders 
we have profited by it. We have 
greatly added to our knowledge of 
the world we live in. But we must

now heed their warning. The fire 
that sears the flesh still burns. We 
must close the shaft. At once.” 

When Sep heard the decision, he 
jumped up, put on his lightest shirt 
and shorts, and hurried out to find 
Sello. “We’re making a mistake, 
Premier,” he protested when he 
found him. “It’s a wonderful world 
up there, and we’ve scarcely given 
it a chance. These I urns are noth- 
ing! They’ll heal in a day or two,” 
he insisted. 

“1 hope so,” said Sello, shuddering 
as he though of Aleta’s burns. “1 
certainly hope so.” 

“Look,” Sep said, baring the flesh 
on his hips. “If you protect yourself 
from the lamp, no harm befalls 
you. We must go hack and — ” Sello 
interrupted him. 

“It’s too late Sep,” Sello said 
quietly. “The shaft has already been 
closed. Not merely closed but col- 
lapsed. There is no shaft there any 
more.” 

Sep nearly said something ex- 
tremely rude. But he stopped him- 
self in time. This was Aleta’s father, 
after all. 

And you couldn’t argue with a 
Council decision. 

He made a secret resolution. In 
twenty years he would be on the 
Council. Perhaps he would be 
Premier. If he was, he would de- 
vote ah his energies to reopening 
the shaft to the wonderful world 
above. 

Yet even as he resolved this, he 
remembered how different the re- 
action of old and young people had 
been to the valley. In twenty years’ 
time, when he had power, he would 



then be nearly as old as Sello was 
now. 

Perhaps, he though bleakly, it 
would always be the same. The 
young were adventurous, the old 
were cautions. 

And the old made all of the de- 
cisions. 

Perhaps all Ascension Days would 
have the same result. Perhaps the 
human race would never have any 
home but Gallery 71, never recog- 
nizing anything else as home. 

And this is wrong. Sep thought 
with the certainty of youth. Sella 
is wrong. He*s not being wise, he's 
being over-cautions. We came from 
that world and we can never he 
more than half alive except in that 
world. 

Sello is wrongs wrong, wrong! 

B ut Sello, though mistaken, was 
not wrong. 

The silvery bird which Aleta had 
admired flew back to its home. And 
next day, although the evidence it 
had brought back was hazy and 
inconclusive, two larger birds ar- 
rived over the valley. 

They saw nothing significant. The 
caved-in shaft looked no different 
from a score of natural scars in the 
floor of the valley. However, just 
to be on the safe side, they dropped 
a radiation bomb. Poison slowly 
spread over the valley. 

Then they flew away. 

In the valley where thirty young 
men and girls had laughed and 
played and bathed less then twenty- 
four hours ago, nothing remained 
but the fire that sears the flesh.

PIG 

IN A BY R. A. LAFFERTY 

POKEY 



The cheerful plgllke alien would 
never harm a human — but it might 
not stop a human harming himself! 



I t happened on Hippodamia. The 
name isn’t really important. 
There are ten thousand other as- 
teroid-stations just as undistinguish- 
ed. 

Netter settled back into the soft, 
live-moss chair and prepared to 
talk the Creature out of the impasse. 
Then, with a shudder, he saw it on 
the wall and he began to tremble. 

He had found, in part, what he 
bad come to find. It was the beefy, 
bearded head of Captain Kalbfleish, 
mounted like a trophy. 



^‘Great God, Man!” — and H 
wasn’t a man to whom he spoke — 
“that’s a human head.” Netter crack- 
ed. 

“Which Great God, yours or 
mine?” Porcellus grunted. “They 
aren’t the same, or they’ve been 
badly described. Yes, a human 
head. I’ve always wanted one. You 
notice that I have given it the 
favored position in the center of 
the great wall. I now have at 
least one of the heads of every 
species that interest me. Some of 



62 



the heads are much larger and more 
ornamented than your friend’s. It’s 
a pity that humans don’t have sweep- 
ing horns; that would make them 
perfect. But even without them, I 
consider Kalbfleish’s head the finest 
in my collection. It’s truly magnifi- 
cant. 

It was. “Kalbfleish has a fine 
head on him,” his friends used to 
say, and laugh. The big captain, for 
all his remarkable courage and spir- 
it, had not been long on brains. 

As a trophy, his head looked 
even wilder than it had when he 
was alive. It had a stark and staring 
expression — as though his death 
had been one of terror and agony. 

“You killed him of course,” said 
Netter dryly, as he braided a romal 
in his nervous hands. “So, one way 
or the other. I’ll have to kill you — 
or you me.” 

“Not I,” said Porcellus — a moist 
and hog-fat Creature. “I wouldn’t 
harm an insect. Your friend had a 
violent heart and it finally ruptured. 
He was uncommonly energetic — 
especially so on the day of his 
death.” 

“Where is his body, you fat pig?” 

“My translator has only a rough 
idea of pig, and I suppose you intend 
it for an insult: but I have a tough 
hide. I couldn’t do a thing with his 
body, Netter, it was putrid in no 
time. When you humans know you 
are going to die you should begin 
giving yourself injections three or 
four basic days before. Then your 
bodies wouldn’t turn foul after death. 
I had no idea he had neglected it, 
so I wasn’t prepared. I was lucky 
to save the head.” 



“We humans don't know when 
we’re going to die,” said Netter. 
“What is this you gave me to eat?* 

“Yes, now' I remember Kalbfleisk 
saying he didn’t know when he 
would die, but I thought that he 
spoke in humor. Since you also say 
it, it must be true of your species. 

“The name of the food would 
mean nothing to you, but yon 
have a close parallel to its method 
of preparation. I have read about 
geese in an Earth book of the ca{^ 
tain’s though I overlooked pigs. Yon 
sometimes put live geese to dance on 
hot griddles before they are killed. 
Because this excites and alarms them 
their livers become enlarged and are 
then eaten as great delicacies The 
creatures whose meat you are eat- 
ing also died in excitement and 
alarm, and they are delicious through 
and through.” 

Well, the meat was certainly de- 
licious. That fat hog of a creature 
knew how to live well. Netter fin- 
ished the meal and set it aside. Once 
more he braided the romal in his 
hands while he grasped for words. 

“I suppose all the creatures whose 
heads you have here died accident- 
ly, Porcellus?” he asked. 

“Well, all but one of them died,” 
said Porcellus, “and I did not kill 
them. One of them died at a great 
distance from here: he willed mo 
his head and had it sent to me be- 
cause I had admired it. And one of 
them, so far as I know is still alive. 
He was a being of multiplex heads. 
He hacked one of them off quite 
willingly when I praised it, and 
cured and mounted it himself. A 
queer chap. He is staring down at 



PIG IN A POKEY 



63 




you now and it will amuse you to 
guess which one he is.” 

P orcellus didn’t actually speak 
like that. He spoke in a series 
of grunts, some verbal and some 
ventral. But Netter’s Console Tran- 
slator had a selector dial. He could 
dial translation in any language, 
pidgeon, diplomatic pleasantry, old 
Southern U.S. soft-talk or Yiddisih 
dialect, among others, if he wished. 
Whenever he encountered a crea- 
ture who was repulsive to him — as 
Porcellus was — he dialed a courtly 
manner of speech. This was some- 
how easier on his ears and nerves. 

“We’re wasting time,” Netter told 
the creature. “I’ve come to pursue 
claim to this asteroid. We need it 
for a way station. As we both know 
it’s never worked out well for two 
such different species to share a 
station. We had first claim here long 
ago: and we abandoned it. Then 
you set up your station here: but 
you also abandoned it.” 

‘‘Never,” said Porcellus. “Would I 
abandon my cozy home and my 
trophies? Would my masters wish 
the removal of so fine a station 
master as myself? I was called Home 
on urgent business. I was gone but 
for a basic year and the odds were 
very high against any other claimer 
coming during that time.” 

“The rules state that a live and 
competent agent must be in residence 
at all times or the asteroid can be 
declared abandoned,” Netter said. 
“The asteroid was plainly abandoned 
when Kalbfleish arrived: you were 
gone. He reported it, and claimed 
the station for our company. The 



claim was approved and accepted.** 
“True,” said the Creature Por- 
cellus. “What is that thing you play 
with in your hands? But Captain 
Kalbfleish — following the awkward 
interval after I had returned — also 
abandoned the station by dying. I so 
reported his death, and claimed the 
station for ourselves aoce more. The 
claim was approved and accepted. 
Now you are here as my guest only 
and, I tell you in all l^dness, not 
a very welcome one.” 

“But a proved murder will void 
your claim,” said Netter. 

“So prove it, fine man,” said 
Porcellus. “Yours is a smaller head 
than Kalbfleish’s but k has a cer- 
tain distinction. I could make room 
for it among my trophies. We have 
each of us sent various reports, and 
the matter is under litigation. " In 
the meanwhile, the accidental death 
of either of us would void his claim 
and settle the matter. We cannot 
kill directly. Investigators are al- 
ready on the way and we would 
both be prime suspects, since we 
are the only ones here. What is 
that leather thing with which you 
play?” 

44 A romal, Porcellus. A short 
quirt braided onto a rein. 
They made them in Old Mexico, 
California and Texas, but they were 
mostly ornamental.” 

“Earth places, my translator say. 
Were they used with a creature?” 
“With a pony, a horse.” 

"Haven’t I stumbled onto the in- 
formation that the horse is extinct?* 
“Yes. The braiding of the little 
thing is only a hobby of mine.” 



64 



IF 




“A hobby, according to my com- 
prehensive translator, is a sort of 
vicarious horse — a mental surrogate 
which one rides. Is that correct?” 

“Correct, Porcellus. Haven’t you 
a hobby?” 

“My hobby is heads.” said the 
thing. 

Netter started to leave for his 
own camp. “To the early and acci- 
dental death of one of us,” he 
toasted, finshing his drink. 

“Shoals!” toasted Porcellus. “I be- 
lieve that is your word. And a warn- 
ing: stay away from the low dome 
which you will see on the plain. It’s 
dangerous.” 

No — Porcellus wanted him to go 
to the curious dome — or he 
wouldn’t have warned him away 
from it. Was it dangerous? Or did 
the thing merely want to divert him? 
Porcellus must have known that he 
would explore every feature of land- 
scape on the small asteroid. Perhaps 
it was only to further worry him, as 
Porcellus himself had seemed to be 
worried. But what in hog heaven 
can worry a hog! Netter had it after 
a while. 

He knows when he’s going to die. 
He’s surprised that humans haven’t 
that knowledge. But can I depend 
on it? It’s only a guess — and a 
poor one at th^t. 

Netter left the dome until last. 
He circumnavigated the asteroid in 
a brisk six-mile walk and found 
nothing of interest. At last he came 
thoughtfully to the dome. 

Rising to no more than his height 
in the center, it was about sixty 
feet in diameter, symmetrical in 
general outline, with a slightly rough 



ened surface, and probably artificial. 
“I believe it is an old direction bea- 
con of the Porcines,” he said aloud 
to himself. “Yes, this is certainly the 
top of an obsolete beam sphere, and 
most of it is underground. They 
were no good. I think we had them 
at one time.” 

Netter stepped gingerly onto the 
sphere. It was certainly firm enough. 
There was no danger of him crash- 
ing through. He climbed to the cen- 
ter. 

“Nice, he said, ‘T)ut nothing.” 
Then he felt it activated “So Porcel- 
lus still uses it,” he said, “I didn’t 
realize they were so backward.” 

H e walked around on it, and it 
rotated gently under him, com- 
pensating for him. He strode down 
the side a little way, and it quickly 
brought him back to the top. “This 
could be fun,” he said. 

He could take three, four quick 
steps away from the top, and he 
would still be on top. He could 
tense to jump sideways, and the 
sphere would compensate before he 
left the surface: he’d still land ex- 
actly on the center whichever way 
he jumped. The thing rolled easily 
and noiselessly, immedately antici- 
pating and reacting to every move- 
ment. He walked, he ran, he laughed 
He trotted half a mile to end up 
standing where he stood before. 

“You know tricks and I know 
tricks, old sphere,” he shouted 
“Let’s see who’s smarter.” He feint- 
ed, he broke, he dodged, he ran 
crazy-legged as though he were 
brokenfield dribbling at Galactk 
rules Football. He evaded tacklers,

he scored countless goals in his 
mind — ^but he never left the dome. 

He lay down and rolled, trying 
to go down the steep far slopes as 
though they were grass banks. He 
stopped rolling and lay on his back. 

“I haven’t had so much fun since 
I was a boy at the amusement park,” 
he said. 

He hadn’t? Then why did he sud- 
denly begin to tremble? Why did- 
he begin to whistle off key. It was 
almost as though he was scared. 
‘^Stone walls do not a pokey make 
nor locks a — ” It was the Cross-Bar 
Hotel Blues he was whistling and 
he had to stop it. 

He was locked tight in jail on a 
hillock in the middle of a plain, 
and there was no barrier in sight. 

There was no possible way he 
could get off the compensating dome. 

After an hour of cavorting and 
hopping about he wasn’t even one 
full step from where he started — 
and there was no possible way that 
he could do better. 

He thought about it for a full 
Hippodamia day and night — forty- 
five minutes basic time. He couldn’t 
come up with anything constructive. 

“If I had a rope and you had a 
stump,” he said talking to no one, 
“I’d rope the stump — I’m good at 
that — and pull myself off this thing. 

But he didn’t have a rope and the 
plain sure didn’t have a stump. It 
hardly had a pebble as big as his 
thumb. 

tC^^T^his is where Kalbleish died,” 
A said Netter “You said it right, 
pig man, my friend had a violent 
heart and it finally ruptured on him. 



You didn’t have to murder him. You 
let him run himself to death. You 
said it, he was uncommonly ener- 
getic — especially so on the day of 
his death. Now I understand. He 
could never stand to be confined. 
He must have gone crazy when 
he realized the paradoxical nature 
of his prison — on the most open 
space on the asteroid. He must have 
run until he ruptured all his organs. 
It is no wonder that he died with 
that look of horror.” 

This was a jail that nobody could 
break. Why try more tricks on the 
sphere? It knew what he was going 
to do even before he did. 

“Only a creature that could fly in 
zero atmosphere could get off of 
this,” he mused. “Even a worm 
couldn’t crawl off unless he were too 
small to affect the compensators. 
If I had two cant hooks I might be 
able to fool the thing, but it could 
no doubt compensate for the resolu- 
tion of forces. If I had a weight on 
a line I might pu^le it a little — but 
not much. Porky has it made. I’ll die 
either of starvation, exertion or in- 
sanity — but the investigation won’t 
show that I was murdered. “Why 
have two humans died of heart at- 
tack here?” is the most they can 
ask him, and Porky will rub his 
hands and say “Bad climate.” 

But what Porky Porcellus really 
said was: 

“Fine man, why do you play like 
a boy on top of that thing? Is that 
any way for a hopeful asteroid agent 
to conduct himself.” 

“Porcellus, you think you’ve trap- 
ped me, do you?” flared Netter. 

“I trap you! My hands are clean.

Is it my fault that two humans de- 
velop the strange mania of running 
themselves to death in a weird 
game!* 

How far away was Porcellus 
from the edge of the dome? Too 
far. Two far by several yards. 

“Porcellus, what is this thing?’* 
Netter cried out. 

“Once it was a beam sphere, as 
you have probably guessed Now 
its obsolete. I have altered it a bit. 
I use it as an intelligence test. To 
fail it is to die.” 

“Did anyone ever get off it?” 
Netter called He had to get Por- 
cellus interested. He had to get him 
to come several feet closer before 
he turned away. 

“Only one passed,” said the crea- 
ture, “and he had unusual natural 
advantages. He was a peculiar fel- 
low of the species Larrik who visited 
me some basic years ago. He sim- 
ply broke himself into two pieces 
and walked off in opposite direc- 
tions. The globe couldn’t compen- 
sate for both of them. One got 
clear, obtained a line and pulled his 
other half off. Both halves lauded 
at me, and then they rejoined them- 
selves. But you haven’t his advan- 
tage, Netter. Yqu have failed.” 

44T’11 find a way,” swore Netter. 
1 “I’ll find a trick.” 

Just a little bit closer now would 
do it. 

“You lose. Netter,” said Porcel- 
his. “There is no fixed thing on 
the plain you could use to pull your- 
self off — even if you had a way of 
reaching it. The longest thing you 
have with you is what you call the 



romal, and it’s not long enough.” 

Porcellus was close enough. Right 
at the end of the dome, when he 
turned it would be perfect — some 
where between thirty-two and thirty- 
five feet. There was no fixed object 
on the plain, but there was some- 
thing heavy enough that would 
serve as one. 

The romal was no longer than 
his arm, but it was a romal rey — 
a king romal. 

Porcellus turned away in his tri- 
umph. The light- thin lariat flew 
and dropped over his body. 

The fat hulk was no match for 
Netter when he was on solid ground. 
He hog-tied the Hog-man with the 
thin leather line and rolled him onto 
the dome. And Porcellus was im- 
mediately on the center top of the 
dome to stay there until he died 
of hunger, uncommon exertion or 
porcine apoplexy . 

Netter was moving things about 
in the fine trophy room which he 
had recently inherited. He set a 
fine hardwood peg into the wall and 
hung on it the king romal for which 
he now had especial afiection. 

He moved many things in the 
trophy room. He wanted 5ie setting 
to be just right. He knew just what 
space it should occupy cm Aat great 
wall. The investigation was over with 
and Netter’s claim had been ac- 
cepted. He was now asteroid sta- 
tionmaster — a good job. 

The head was ready. It had been 
cured out and tanned and treated, 
and the eye-tushers were polished 
until they gleamed. 

Porcellus had a magnificent head!

What Has Gone Before

John Bravals, mtelligence operator and soldier of fortune, 
IS assigned to track down the report that strange creatures are 
interfering in the formal war games the world uses to settle its 
diplomatic problems. Fitted out with special equipment, he visits 
one battle and finds a creature that looks like a huge, savage dog 
that uses superscientific weapons to destroy a tank, kill its crew 
. and in a matter of seconds operate on their bodies to remove 
their brains. 

Bravais reports back to Ms superiors and is given a new body 
to help him match the superfast, super-strong hounds of hell. Fitted 
out with prosthetic muscles and skin of steel, with sensory equipment 
that matches the radar of a battleship and the long-distance sensi- 
tivity of Project Ozma, able to work for days without rest and to 
destroy any mortal adversary, Bravais sets out to find the creatures 
— and succeeds too well. For they are everywhere. Masked as 
humans, relying on a psionk ability to camouflage themselves, 
they pass as military officers, diplomats — Earth leaders of every 
variety. 

Bravais's superiors are killed. He himself is a fugitive and 
alone. Wounded, helpless, he stows away aboard a cargo sub- 
marine headed for the U.S.A.

questions, the captain blandly deny- 
ing any knowledge of stowaways. I 
was waiting just inside the deck- 
house door as he invited his official 
visitors to search the ship. They de- 
clined with curses. 

I heard them reboard their launch; 
then the sound of its engines growled 
away across the water. I leaned 
against the wall, feeling hot and 
dizzy. My arm throbbed like a giant 
toothache. 

Joel had been waiting with me. 
“Hey, Jones,” he said. “How come 
we’re hanging around here? You go- 
ing out on deck?” 

I let a long breath out; it was a 
bad habit I was forming — forgetting 
to breathe for minutes at a stretch. 
I straightened with an effort, feeling 
the deck move under me. “Sure,” I 
said. “Let’s go take a look at the 
Rock.” 

The cold pre-dawn air cleared my 
head. I leaned on the rail beside 
Joel, watching the towering barrier 
walls slip down into the churning 
water as the lock filled. Then the 
tanker edged ahead, the mighty gates 
slid in behind us, churning water 
aside, met with a dull boom. Again 
we rode the flood, gaining another 
hundred feet. 

Forty-five minutes and five locks 
later we slid out into the choppy, 
blue-black waters of the South At- 
lantic, five hundred feet above the 
level of the Mediterranean. Dawn 
was coloring the sky now. Lights 
gleamed wanly from the fortress of 
Gibraltar, and from the flat, white 
city on the African side. 

A raucous buzzer sounded across 
the deck. 

?0 



“Hey, we better get below before 
we get dunked,” Joel advised. We 
stepped back into the stale interior. 
A moment later we heard the crash 
of the waters closing over us above, 
then the silence of the deep sea set- 
tled in again. 

“Well,” Joel said cheerfully. “I 
guess we got to get back to work, 
Jones.” 

I nodded. For a moment, black- 
ness whirled before me as I turned. 
I caught myself, followed Joel back 
down into the ship. 

D uring the next forty-eight hours, 
Joel and I found time for sev- 
eral four-hour sleeps and a couple 
of short naps between bellowed or- 
ders from Carboni or the unseen 
captain. At odd intervals we went 
to the crew mess, demanded and got 
plates of oily cold-storage eggs and 
too-salty bacon. 

Now, having just completed a 
laborious two-hour visual inspection 
of reset switches, I again sat at the 
long table, listening to the feverish 
humming in my head, picking at a 
mixture of mummified beef and 
canned milk and taking medicinal 
sips from a clay mug of North Af- 
rican brandy. Across the table, the 
bearded elder known as Doc worked 
conscientiously to finish the bottle. 

Joel had put his head on the table 
and gone off to sleep. At the far end 
of the room, Fogey, the horse-faced 
man, monotonously and with much 
profanity called off items from an 
inventory list while a short, chinless 
sailor with a wool cap and warts 
ticked them off on a clipboard. 
What the rest of the nine-man crew 

IF 




did aboard the vessel, I hadn’t yet 
learned. Four of them had just left 
the room, staggering drunk. 

“Three more trips, Jones,” Doc 
stated. “Thirty-one years on the line 
— nine on Excalibur. I’ll miss the 
old tub.” He looked around the 
room with sad, red-veined eyes. 
“No, Fm a damned liar,” he cor- 
rected. “I hate this damned scow.” 
He looked at me as though I had 
praised it. “I’ve hated every min- 
ute of those thirty-one years. Hated 
medical school before that. You ever 
been in a cadaver lab?” 

“Sure have,” I said, forcing my- 
self to follow the conversation. 
“There was a fellow I hadn’t seen 
for years. Opened up the tin box, 
and there he was.” I sipped the 
brandy, feeling it burn its way down. 
Doc worked his lips, blinked, took a 
puD at his drink. 

“I knew a fellow,” he said, “sold 
his body to a medical school. Got 
five hundred cees for it, which he 
badly needed at the time. Later on 
he got in the chips and thought bet- 
ter of the bargain. Wanted to buy 
it back. Well, seems like the title had 
changed hands a couple of times. 
He traced it from Yak to Georgia, 
and on down to Miami. Finally 
caught up with it.” He took a heal- 
thy draught from his cup, exhaled 
noisily. “Too late, though. End of 
the year, you know. Nothing left but 
a few ribs, the left arm, and the bot- 
tom half of the cranium.” He sighed. 
“A sad case.” 

H is image was wavering, ob- 
scured by whirling points of 
light; I blinked them away, raised 



my glass to him. “Doc, you’re one' 
of the finest liars I ever met.” 

He blushed, looking modest. 

“Shucks, seems like things just 
naturally happen to me. Why, I 
remember the time . .” he ram- 
bled on. At the far end of the table, 
Fogey tossed his list aside, yawned, 
scratched at an unshaven jaw. 

“Get some coffee over here, 
Runt,” he ordered. The warty sailor 
bustled, operating the coffee maker, 
filled a two-quart pot, rattled thick 
cups and sheet-metal spoons. He 
placed the pot iu front of the horse- 
faced man. 

“Watch out, Mr. Dobbin. She’s 
plenty hot.” He went back to his list, 
muttering to himself. 

Fogey grunted; He glanced at 
Joel, snoring across the table from 
him; he licked a finger, touched 
it to the polished metal; it hissed. 
An expression twitched at the cor- 
ners of his mouth. He took the 
pot gingerly by the massive insul- 
ated handle, stood. 

“Hey, dummy!” he said sharply. 

Joel stirred. 

“Wake up, dummy!” 

Joel sat up, knuckling his eyes. 
He saw Fogey and smiled. 

“Gee, I guess I — ” he started. 

“Here!” Fogey thrust the pot at 
him. Joel reached out, took the 
rounded container in his two huge 
hands. His jaw dropped. His eyes 
widened. Fogey stepped back, his 
mouth arched m a grin like some- 
thing carved at the top of Notre 
Dame. 

I was a little slow, but I reached 
Joel then, knocked the steaming pot 
from hk bandr, it smashed against 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



71 




the wall behind Pogey, spewed steam 
and liquid in a wide sheet that caught 
the horse-faced man full across the 
back. He howled, writhed away 
from the table, clutching at his 
shoulder. He screamed again, tore 
at his jacket. Doc came to his feet, 
grabbing at the bottle as it tottered, 
almost fell. The horse-faced man 
clawed his shirt open, ripped it 
from his shoulders. A vast red blis- 
ter swelled visibly from his patchy 
hair-line almost to the soiled edge 
of the underwear showing above his 
belt. His eye fell on Doc. 

“Do something, damn your guts!” 
he shrilled. “Oh, Jesus . .” 

Doc started around the table. 1 
caught his arm. “To hell with that 
sadist,” I said. “Take a look at 
Joel’s hands.” 

Joel still stood, staring at his 
hands. A tear formed, rolled down 
his cheek. 

“I’ll kill him!” Pogey screeched. 
He plunged across the room, 
knocked the sailor aside, caught up 
a steak knife, whirled on Joel. 1 
pushed in front of him. The odors 
of sweat and alcohol came from 
him in waves. I caught his wrist, 
remembering not to pulp the bone. 

“Joel,” I said, my eyes holding 
on Pogey’s. “If this man ever hurts 
you again, put your thumbs into his 
throat until he stops moving, under- 
stand?” 

I twitched the knife from Pogey’s 
hand, shoved him from me. His 
face was as white now as the dead 
face of the thing I had killed in the 
ravine. The recollection must have 
shown in my expression. Pogey 
shivered, backed, turned to the 



sailor who was standing wide-eyed, 
all warts and Adam’s apple, look- 
ing from one of us to the other 
like a spectator at a ping-pong 
tournament. 

“Get me to my room,” Pogey 
gasped out. His knees went slack as 
the sailor caught him. Behind me, 
Joel moaned. 

“Let’s get this boy down to my 
sick-bay,” Doc was saying. “Sec- 
ond-degree, maybe worse. Callouset 
helped . .” As I turned, his eyes 
found mine. 

“You better let me take a look at 
you, too,” he said. “You’re hotter’n 
a power pile, Jones.” 

I put a hand on the desk to keep 
it from spinning. 

“How’s Joel?” My voice seemed 
to belong to someone else. A wave 
of nausea rolled over me, left me 
shivering violently. 

/ would have to wait ... I forced 
my thoughts to hold to the sub- 
ject. Wait until they came. There 
would be a band, dressed all in Red, 
and General Julius would be leading 
it . 

I fought the fantasy away. Delir- 
ium waited like a mire beside the 
nari;ow path of reason. Nothing to 
do with Julius. Julius was dead. I 
had strangled him, while he bit at 
me. The dog-things had chased me, 
and now I was on the beach. It was 
cold, cold ... I shivered violently, 
huddling against the steel cliff. 

Joel was calling my name. He 
needed help, but I was trapped. 

“Please, Jones . don’t hit the 
doc.” 

I got my eyes open. Joel’s face 

IF 



72 








TWE HOUNDS OF HEU 




loomed above me. Blood ran from 
his nose. Doc’s frightened face 
stared. I fell back, feeling my heart 
pound like a shoeing hammer. 

I lay back and let the dream take 
me . 

I awoke feeling weak, sick, beaten, 
thrown away. I stirred, heard 
cloth tear. I looked down; my left 
arm, as numb as something carved 
from marble, was strapped to my 
side. I felt the pull of tape at my 
neck, across my jaw. My mouth 
tasted as though mice had nested 
in it. I sat up as weak as a diplomatic 
protest. 

I got to my feet, blinked away a 
light-shot blackness, went across to 
the door, looked out through the 
bars. Joel lay in the corridor, asleep 
on a mat. I called his name. 

He sat up, rubbed his eyes, smiled. 
“Hey, Jones!” He got to his feet, 
touched his swollen nose. “Boy, 
Jones, you sure pack a wallop. You 
feeling better now?” 

“Lots better. How long was I 
out?” 

He looked down at me vaguely. 
“How long before we reach Jack- 
sonville?” 

“Gosh, Jones, I dunno. Pretty 
soon, maybe.” 

I tensed the muscles behind my 
cars, tuned through the sounds of 
the ship, picked up the mutter of 
voices; but they were indistinct, un- 
readable. 

“Listen to me, Joel,” I said. 
“There’ll be police waiting for me 
when we dock. I have to get off the 
ship before then. How long before 
we surface?” 



“Huh? Hey, hows come cops is 
after you, Jones?” 

“Never mind that, Joel. Try to 
think, now. Do we surface out at 
sea, before we get into the harbor?” 
Joel frowned.” “Gosh, I don’t 
know about that, Jones.” 

I gripped the bars. “I want you to 
do something for me, Joel. Go to 
the crew mess. There’s a clock there. 
Go check it, and come back and 
tell me what time it is.” 

Joel nodded. “Okay, Jones. Sure. 
Hows come . .” 

“I’ll tell you later. Hurry!” 

I sat on the floor and waited. The 
deck seemed to surge under me. 
Either we were maneuvering, or I 
was having another relapse. 

There was a distant booming, the 
sudden vibration of turbulence trans- 
mitted through the hull. The ship 
heaved, settled. I got to my feet, 
holding to the wall for support. The 
question of when we would surface 
had become academic. We were on 
the top now. 

There were sounds along the 
corridor: the clump of feet, raised 
voices. I keened my hearing again, 
picked up the whine of the main 
drive turbines, the clatter of de- 
ploying deck gear, the creak of the 
hull — and another sound: the rhy- 
thmic growl of a small-boat engine, 
far away but coming closer. 

The minutes crawled on like 
8tepped-on roaches. Joel appeared 
down the corridor, came up to the 
cell door. There was a worried look 
on his face. “The big hand was on 
. lessee . Hey, Jones.” He 
looked at me like a lost kid. “I got 
a funny feeling.” 



74 







“Sure, Joel. I’m scared, too.” 

But I got this like tickle-feeling 
in my head.” 

I nodded, listening for the sounds 
from above. The boat was close 
now. I heard its engines cut back; 
then it was bumping alongside. The 
sound of the ship’s turbines had 
faded to a growl. 

“Does a customs boat usually 
come out to meet the ship in the 
harbor?” 

Joel was rubbing his head with 
one bandaged hand. He looked up 
at the low ceiling and whimpered. 

“What is it, Joel?” Then I felt it: 
the eerie sense of unreality, the gray- 
ing of the light in the dim corridor, 
the sense of doom impending. I 
grabbed the bars, strained at them. 
The metal gave, grudgingly, a frac- 
tion of an inch; my head pounded 
from the effort. 

“Joel!” I called. My voice had a 
ragged edge to it. “Who keeps the 
key to this door?” 

His eyes wavered down to meet 
mine. 

“Uh . Carboni keeps all the 
keys.” 

“Can you get them?” 

Joel looked at the ceiling. I heard 
feet on the deck now — and a soft 
padding that sent a chill through 
me like an iron spear. 

“I got such a tickle in my head,” 
he moaned. “I’m scared, Jones. 
Sometimes — ” he brushed at his 
face, groping for words — “when I 
seen the big dogs it was just like 
this, Jones. It tickled in my head.” 

T swallowed hard. “Tell me about 
the big dogs. Joel.” 

“T didn’t like them dogs, Jones. 



They scared me. 1 run when I seen 
’em. I hid.” 

“When did you see them?” 

“In port. Lots of times. I seen 
’em in the streets, and inside build- 
ings. I seen ’em looking out of 
cars.” He pointed to the ceiling. 
“They’re up there now. I can tell.” 
“Listen, Joel. Go to Carboni’s of- 
fice; get the keys; the one you want 
is a big electrokey. Bring it here, as 
fast as you can.” 

“I’m scared, Jones.” But he 
stepped back with a sob, turned and 
ran. I clung to the bars and waited, 
listening to the feet that prowled 
the deck above. 

T he ship was deathly still now ex- 
cept for the slap of water, the 
groan of structural members as the 
hull flexed under the motion of the 
waves. I heard stealthy feet mov- 
ing, the rasp of unhuman hands at 
the deckhouse door. 

Joel appeared, half-running. T 
heard the other footsteps slow, come 
to a stop. I pictured the thing, stand- 
ing with one pale hand upraised like 
a dog on point, its death-mask turn- 
ing, searching for the source of the 
sounds. 

I motioned to Joel. “Keep it 
quiet!” I hissed. He came up to the 
door, holding up the key, a two-inch 
square of black plastic from which 
a short metal rod protruded. 

“Carboni was setting right there. 
He never even looked up.” 

“Get the door open,” I whispered 
urgently. He inserted the key, his 
tongue in the corner of his mouth. 
I could hear the thing around the 
comer, coming back now, hurrying. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



7B 




The lock snickered; I slid the door 
aside, stepped into the passage — 
The creature bounded into view, 
brought up short, red eyes staring 
in a white mask. 

Beside me, Joel cried out. I 
pushed in front of him as the demon 
sprang, slammed a blow to its head 
that sent it sprawling past me. It 
was up instantly, whirling, rearing 
up on thin too-long legs. I chopped 
at its neck with the side of my hand, 
jumped back as its jaws snapped 
half an inch from my wrist, swung 
a kick that caught its hip, knocked 
it against . the wall. It yelped and 
came at me, dragging a hind leg. 
Behind it, Joel stood, mouth open, 
flat against the cell door. 

1 shook my head to clear it. The 
scene before me wavered; a sound 
like roaring waters filled my head. 

A cannonball struck me, carried 
me back, down. The needle-filled 
mouth was a foot from my face, 
and I hit at it, caught a fist-full of 
stiff-bristled hide, held the snapping 
jaws from me. The great pale hands 
struck at me — ^poorly aimed, feeble 
blows. The jaws were the demon’s 
weapon. They ravened inches from 
my face — and my arm was weak- 
ening. 

T he beast lunged backward, twist- 
ed free from my one-handed 

grip. 

I heard Joel’s yell, instantly 
choked off. I came to my knees, saw 
the flurry of motion as the demon 
bore him backwards. I got my feet 
under me, took two steps, threw my- 
self at the black-bristled back, locked 
my right arm around its throat in a 



crushing embrace. I lunged back- 
ward, rolled clear of Joel, saw him 
stumble to his feet, start toward 
me — 

“Stay clearl” I shouted. The 
demon fought, flailing the deck and 
walls with wild blows of its four 
hands. I held on, choking it, feel- 
ing bone and cartilage collapse, 
grinding the shattered throat until 
the head fell slack. 

One leg drummed for a moment 
against the deck. Then the thing 
stiffened and was still. 

I pushed it aside, tottered to my 
feet. Joel stared at me, dazed. I 
listened, heard the slap of running 
beast-hands. 

“Into the cell, Joel!” I pushed him 
inside, slammed and locked the door. 

“You’ll be safe there — they won’t 
bother with you,” I called. “When 
you get ashore, go home, stay there. 
You understand?” 

He nodded dumbly. The feet were 
close now. I turned, ran along the 
passage, took a cross-corridor, near- 
ly fell over someone sprawled on the 
deck. A patch of evening sky showed 
at the top of the companionway. I 
went up, leaped out on the open 
deck, almost awash in the still sea. 
I caught a glimpse of two demons 
standing with raised heads, as though 
listening, while beyond them a third 
crouched over a fallen crewman. 
Three steps took me to the rail; I 
leaped over it and dived into the 
dark water. 

Coffeyville, Kansas, Felix had 
said. Box 1742, the Franklin Street 
Postal Station. 

It was a long drive for an invalid, 
and what I would find at the end

IF 




of it I didn’t know — ^but it was 
something that Felix had thought 
important enough to lock in the 
final strongbox of his subconscious. 

I headed north. 

XII 

A lifetime later, I steered a 
stolen pick-up to the curb on a 
snow-frosted side street of sagging, 
cavernous houses that had been the 
culminating achievements of rich 
farmers a century before. Now they 
looked as bleak and empty as aban- 
doned funeral homes. 

I got out of the car, waited until 
the pavement settled down, then 
walked back two blocks to a struc- 
ture in red-brick Gothic bearing the 
legend: 

RAILROAD MENS YMCA 
Coffeyville, Kans. 1965 

Inside, a bored-looking youngish 
man with thinning hair and a pursed 
mouth watched me from behind the 
peeling veneer of a kidney-shaped 
desk with a faded sign reading WEL- 
COME BROTHER and another, 
hand-lettered, announcing: SHOW- 
ER-FIFTY DOLLARS. I ignored 
the sea of gray Jello in which his 
face seemed to float, got a hand on 
the desk, . leaned more or less up- 
right, and heard somebody say, ‘T’d 
like a room for tonight.” 

His mouth was moving. It was 
hot in the room. I pulled at my 
collar. The Jello had closed over the 
clerk now, but a voice with an edge 
like a meat saw went on: 

. drunks in the place. You’ll 
have to clear out of here. This — ” 



•^Unfortunately, I’m not drunk,” 
I heard myself pronouncing the 
words quite distinctly. ‘T’m a bit 
off my feed. Touch of an old ma- 
laria, possibly.” 

He was swimming back into focus. 
My feet seemed to be swinging in 
a slow arc over my hea^i. I kept both 
hands on the counter and tried to 
convince myself that I was standing 
solidly on the rubber mat that cov- 
ered the worn place in the rug. I 
let go long enough to get out my 
wallet, put money on the counter. 

“Well . .” His hand covered the 
bill. “You do look a little flushed. 
Chinese flu, maybe. Maybe you’d 
better see a doctor. And that’s a 
nasty cut on your face.” 

“Not used to these new-fangled 
safety razors,” I said. “I’ll be all 
right.” The floor was sliding back 
to where it belonged now. The Jello 
had thinned out sufficiently to show 
me the registration book and a finger 
with a hang-nail indicating the line 
where I should sign. My stomach 
felt like a flush tank on the verge 
of starting its cycle. I grabbed the 
stylus, scrawled something, waded 
through knee-deep fog to the lift, 
rode up, walked past a few miles 
of wallpaper that was someone’s re- 
venge for life’s disappointments, 
found my room, got the door open, 
took a step toward the bed and 
passed out cold. 

A crew of little red men was work- 
ing at my arm with saws and 
hatchets, while another played a 
blow-torch over my face. I tried to 
yeU to scare them away, managed a 
weak croak. I got my eyes open, dis

covered that my face was against a 
dusty rug with a pattern of faded 
fruits and flowers; I crawled as far 
as the wall-mounted lavatory, pulled 
myself up, got the cold water on, 
splashed it over my head. I could 
hear myself moaning, like a dog 
begging to be let in on a cold night; 
it didn’t seem important. I let myself 
moan. 

There was yellow light outside 
the dirt-scaled window when I tot- 
tered across to the bed; the next 
time I looked it was deep twilight. 
Time seemed to be slipping by in 
large pieces, Hke an ice-floe break- 
ing up. I got up on the third try, 
went back and used more cold water, 
then braced my feet and risked a 
look in the mirror. 

An hour later, with half a dozen 
assorted fever- depressants, cortical 
stimulants, metabolic catalyzers, and 
happy pills in my stomach, I took a 
hot shower, shaved, put a clean tape 
on my jaw and went downstairs. The 
clerk used his worried look at me. 

“Maybe you hadn’t ought to go 
out, sir,” he suggested. 

I said “I’ll manage. Where’s 
Franklin Street?” 

He gave me directions and I went 
out into the chill of the late autumn 
night. I considered calling a cab, 
but decided against it. My exper- 
iences had made me wary of shar- 
ing confined spaces with strangers. 
Using the pick-up was out, too; a 
hot car might attract just the at- 
tention I was most desirous of 
avoiding at the moment. 

I started off at a wobbling gait 
that steadied as the chemicals in my 
blood stream started to work, my 



breath freezing into ice-crystals. 

The Post Office was a low, yel- 
lowish armorplast front with a glass 
door flanked on one side by a code- 
punch panel, and on the other by 
colorful exhortations to Enlist Now 
in the Peace Brigade and Fight For 
the Way of Life of Your Choice. I 
strolled to the panel, punched keys 
one, seven, four, and two. 

Machinery whirred. A box popped 
into view. Through the quarter-inch 
armorplast, I could see a thick man- 
ilia envelope. The proper code would 
cause the transparent panel to slide 
up — ^but unfortunately Felix hadn’t 
had time to give k to me. 

I slammed my fist against the 
plastic. It made a hell of a loud 
noise; a faint mark appeared on the 
panel. I set myself, hit k again as 
hard as I could. The plastic shat- 
tered diis time. I poked the sharp 
fragments in, got my fingers on the 
envelope, pulled it out through the 
jagged opening. I could hear a bell 
starting up far back inside the build- 
ing. Nearer at hand, a red light 
above the door blinked furiously. It 
was unfortunate — but a risk I had 
had to take. I tucked the envelope 
away, turned, took two steps — 

A loping dog-shape rounded the 
corner, galloped silently toward me. 

I spun; a second was angling 
across the street at a dead run. Far 
down the street, two pedestrians 
sauntered on their ways, oblivious 
of what was happening; there was 
no one else in sight. A third demon 
appeared at an alley mouth across 
the street, trotted directly toward 
me, sharp ears erect, skull-face smil- 
ing. 



78 



IF 




There was a dark delivery-van at 
the curb. I leaped to it, tried the 
door — locked. I doubled my fist, 
smashed the glass, got the door open. 
The nearest demon broke into an 
awkward gallop. I slid into the seat, 
twisted the key, accelerated from 
the curb as the thing leaped. It 
struck just behind the door, clung 
for a moment, fell off. I steered for 
the one in the street ahead, saw it 
dodge aside at the last instant — just 
too late. There was a heavy shock; 
the car veered. I caught it, rounded 
a corner on two wheels, steering 
awkwardly with one hand. The gyros 
screeched their protest as I zig- 
zagged, missing another dog-thing 
coming up fast, then straightened out 
and roared off toward the polyarcs 
of a major expressway intermix. 
I caught a glimpse of a road-side 
sign: 

CAUTION! 

KANSAS 199 — V 4 MI. SW. 

AUTODRIVE 100 YDS. 
MANDATORY ABOVE 100 MPH 

I braked quickly, passed the blue 
glare-sign that indicated the pick- 
up point for the state autodrive sys- 
tem, squealed to a stop fifty yards 
beyond it. I switched the drive lever 
to AUTO,' set the cruise control on 
MAX LEG., jumped out, reached 
back in to flick the van into gear. 
It started off, came quickly up to 
speed, jerkily corrected course as 
it crossed the system monitor line. 

I watched it as it swung off into 
the banked curve ahead, accelerat- 
ing rapidly; then I climbed an anci- 
ent wire fence, stumbled across a 



snow-scattered plouged field and in- 
to the shelter of the trees. 

E xcitement, I was discovering, 
wasn’t good for my ailment. I 
had another attack of nausea that 
left me pale, trembling, empty as a 
looted house, and easily strong 
enough to sort out a stamp collec- 
tion, using power-assisted tongs. I 
swayed on all fours, smelling leaf- 
mould and frozen bark, hearing a 
distant croak of tree-frogs. 

The demons had laid a neat trap 
for me. They had watched, followed 
my movements — probably from the 
time I left the ship — waiting for the 
proper time to close in. My trick 
with the van had gained me a few 
minutes respite — but nothing more. 
Alerted police would bring the 
empty vehicle to a halt within a 
mile or two; then a cordon would 
close in, beating every thicket, un- 
til they found me. 

Meanwhile, I had time enough to 
take a look at whatever it was that 
I had come five thousand miles to 
collect — the thing Felix had guard- 
ed with the last fragment of his will. 

I took the envelope from the inner 
pocket, tore off one end. A two- 
inch-square wafer of translucent 
polyon slipped into my hand. In the 
faint starlight, I could see a pattern 
of fine wires and vari-colored beads 
imbedded in the material. I turned it 
over, smelled it, shook it, held it to 
my ear. 

Identify your self,'' a tiny voice 
said. 

I jumped, held the thing on my 
palm to stare at it, then cautiously 
put it to my ear again. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

^*You now have sixty seconds in

Fifty-eight seconds and count-

I held the rectangle before my 
mouth. 

“Bravais,” I said. “John Bravais, 
CBI SA-0654 ...” I listened again: 

“. fifty-two; fifty -one . fifty 
»> 

I talked to it some more, listened 
again: 

“. forty- four; forty-three; forty

Talking to it wasn’t getting me 
anywhere. How the hell did you 
identify yourself to a piece of plas- 
tic the size of a book of matches? 
Fingerprints? A membership card in

I pulled out my CBI card, held it 
to the plastic, then listened again: 

. thirty-one; thirty- . 
There was a pause. the absence 
of proper identification within thirty 
seconds, this plaque will detonate. 
Unauthorized personnel are warned 
to withdraw to fifty yards. Twenty 
seconds and counting. Nineteen; 
eighteen . 

I had my arm back, ready to throw 
— but I checked the motion. The 
blast would attract everything with- 
ih a mile, from flying saucer watch- 
ers to red-eyed beast-shapes that 
loped on hands, like a man — and 
I would -have lost my one ace in a 
game where the stakes were more 
than life and death. I hesitated, 
looked at the ticking bomb in my 
hand. “Thinking caps, children,” I 
whispered aloud. “Thinking caps, 
thinking caps . .” 

Talking to it was no good; ID 



cards with built-in molecular pat- 
terns for special scanners meant 
nothing to it. It had to be something 
he hadn’t had time to tell me. 

A signal had to be transmitted. 
I had nothing — except an array of 
gimmicks built into my teeth by 
Felix . 

There was a spy-eye detector 
which would set up a sharp twinge 
in my left upper canine under any 
radiation on the spy band; the right 
lower incisor housed a CBI emer- 
gency band receiver; in my right 
lower third molar, there was minia- 
ture radar pulser — 

A transmitter. Just possibly — if 
there was still time. I jammed 
the plaque to my ear: 

“. ten seconds and counting. 
Nine — ” 

With my tongue, I pushed aside 
the protective cap on the tooth, bit 
down; there was a sour taste of gal- 
vanic action as the contacts closed, 
a tingle as an echo bounced back 
from metal somewhere out across 
the night. I pulsed again; if that 
hadn’t done it, nothing would. 

“Tom are recognized/^ the voice 
said crisply. “Tom are now seven 
hundred and thirty-two yards north- 
north-east of the station . .” 

I got to my feet, took a bearing 
on the North Star, and set off 
through the trees. 

Nearly an hour later I came out 
of the woods onto an unsurfaced 
track, went through a ditch choked 
with stiff, waist-high weeds, scraped 
myself getting over a rotting wire 
fence. There were headlights on the 
distant highway now, and other

THE HOUNDS OF HELL 




lights coming out from Coffeyvillc. 
I put the wafer to my ear. 

. two hundred twenty-two 
yards, bearing two-oh-seven/" the 
calm voice said. I picked my way 
past the rusted hulk of a tractor 
abandoned under the crabbed 
branches of a dead apple tree, came 
back into the open, broke into a rur 
across a grassed stretch that had 
probably been a pasture forty years 
earlier. Faint light fell across the 
ground ahead; my shadow bobbed in 
front of me, swung aside and dis- 
appeared. Cars were closing in on 
the wood lot behind me. 

"... hundred and fifty-four yards, 
bearing two one three . 

I corrected course to the right, 
plunged down a slight slope, crashed 
through a dense growth of brush, 
went knee-deep into half-frozen 
muck, sending skim-ice tinkling. 
Dry stalks broke under my hand as 
I clawed my Way up an embank- 
ment. I came to a gasping halt, 
checked my position: eighteen yards, 
bearing two seven five ... I left 
the road, ran past a fallen barn. 

And there was nothing; not so 
much as a marker stone or a dry 
bush. Standing alone in the frozen 
field, shivering with the bitter cold, 
I could hear approaching feet — 
more than one set of them. I turned 
to face them, taking deep breaths 
to charge my air banks, tried to 
blink the fog from my failing vis- 
ipn. It would be over in another 
minute. I would try to kill at least 
one more of them before those 
bony snouts found my throat. 

I started to toss the useless plague 
aside, on Impulse put it to my ear. 



“ — rectly above the entry; please 
re-identify ... You are now direct- 
ly above the entry; please re-identify 
. You are now — ” 

I groped with my tongue, bit 
down on the tooth. Nothing happen- 
ed. Through the darkness, I saw a 
movement among the scattered trees. 
Near at hand, there was a soft hum, 
a grating sound. Directly before me, 
dirt stirred; a polished -cylinder a 
yard across, dirt-topped, emerged 
from the earth, rose swiftly to a 
height of six feet. With a click! a 
panel slid back, exposing an unlight- 
ed and featureless interior. I didn’t 
linger; I stepped inside, felt the shaft 
start down, and stumbled out into 
warmth and silence. 

XIII 

I was in a small, softly-lit room 
with a polished floor, warm to 
the touch, and walls which were a 
jumble of ancient, varnished oak 
cabinet-work, gray-painted equip- 
ment housings, instrument panels, 
indicator lights, and controls re- 
sembling those of a Tri-D starship. 
Exposed wiring and conduit criss- 
crossed the panels. A vast clock with 
fanciful Roman numerals and ela- 
borate hands said ten minutes past 
ten. 

It was like nothing I had ever 
seen — except for a remote re- 
semblance to Felix’s underground 
laboratory in Tamboula. I felt an 
urge to hysterical laughter as I 
thought of the things up above, 
prowling the ground now, converg- 
ing on the spot from which I had 
miraculously disappeared. How long 



92 



IF 




would it be before they started to 
dig? The urge to laugh died. 

I closed my eyes, gathered my 
forces, such as they were, and keen- 
ed my hearing . 

Rustling sounds in the earth aU 
about me; the slow grind of the 
earthworm, the frantic scrabble, 
pause, scrabble of the burrowing 
mole, the soft, tentative creak of the 
questing root . 

I tuned, reaching out . 

Wind moaned in the trees. Soft 
footfalls thump, thumped, crossing 
the field above me. There was the 
growl of a turbine, coming closer, 
the grate of tires in soft earth. A 
door slammed, feet clumped. 

‘7/ did not come this way” a flat 
voice said. 

Something gibbered — a sound 
that turned my spine to ice. 

“Zr is sick and weak” the first 
voice said. '*lt is only a man. It did 
not come this way. It is not here” 

More of the breathy gobbling; I 
could almost see the skull-face, the 
grinning mouth, the rag-tongue mov- 
ing as it commanded the man- 
shaped slave standing before it. 

“7/ is not here” the humanoid 
said. *7 will return to my post in 
the village.” 

Now the gabble was angry, in- 
sistent. It commanded. 

**It is not logical,” the toneless 
voice said. **It went another way. 
The other units will find it.” 

Two beast-things gibbered. 

**You let it escape you at the vih 
lage,” a lifeless voice replied. **Thai 
was not in accordance with logic.” 

The argument went on, twenty 
feet above my hidden sanctuary. 



**... a factor which we cannot 
compute,” a dead voice stated. ‘'To 
remain here is unintelligent.” Foot- 
steps tramped away. The car door 
clattered open, slammed. A turbine 
growled into life; tires crunched the 
hard earth, going away. 

Soft feet paced above me. Two of 
the creatures, possibly three, crossed 
and re-crossed the area. I could hear 
them as they conferred,’ a conversa- 
tion of goblins. Then two stalked 
away, while the third settled down 
heavily to wait. 

y took out my talking plastic rec- 
tangle and put it to my ear. 

‘‘. now in Survival Station 
Twelve,’’ the precise voice was say- 
ing. ‘‘Place this token in the il- 
luminated slot on the station moni- 
tor panel.” There was a pause. “You 

are now in Survival Station Twelve 
»» 

Across the room, there was a re- 
cessed scrollwork console dimly lit 
by a yellow glare strip. I wavered 
across to it, found the lighted slot, 
pressed the wafer into it, then lean- 
ed against a chair, waiting. Things 
clicked and hummed; a white light 
snapped on, giving the room a 
cheery, clinical look, like a prepara- 
tory buzz, matching the humming 
in my head; then: 

“This is your Station Monitor,” a 
deep voice said in near-monotone. 
“The voice you hear is a 'speech- 
construct, capable of verbalizing 
computer findings. The unit is also 
capable of receiving programming 
instructions verbally. Please speak 
distinctly and unambiguously. Do 
not employ slang or unusual con-

structions* Avoid words having mul- 
tiple denotations.” 

The room seemed to fade and 
brighten, swaying like a cable-car in 
a high wind. 1 was beginning to 
learn the signs; I would black out 
in a few seconds. I looked, around 
for a soft place to fall, while the 
voice droned on. Abruptly, it broke 
off. Then: 

^‘Emergency overidel” it said 
sharply. “Sensing instruments in- 
dicate you require immediate medi- 
cal attention . There was a 
sound behind me; I turned. As in a 
dream, I saw a white-sheeted cot 
deploy from a wall recess, roll across 
the room hunting a little, then come 
straight on and stop beside me. 

“Place yourself on the cot, with 
your head at the equipment end.” 
The voice echoed from far away. 
I made a vast effort, pushed myself 
clear of the chair, fell across the 
bed. I was struggling to get myself 
on it, when I felt a touch, twisted 
to see padded, jointed arms grasp 
me and gently but firmly hoist me 
up and lay me out, face-down. The 
sheet was smooth and cool under 
my face. 

“You will undergo emergency 
diagnosis and treatment,” the voice 
said. “An anesthetic will be adminis- 
tered if required. Do not be alarm- 
ed.” 

I caught just one whiff of neo- 
polyform. Then I was relaxing, let- 
ting it all go, sliding down a long, 
smooth slope into a warm, dark sea. 

I came out of it with a sensation 
that took me a moment or two to 
analyze — a cold-water, gray-skies. 



no-nonsense sort of feeling. For tho 
first time in days — how many I 
didn’t know — the fine feverish 
threads of delirium were lacking in 
the ragged fabric of my thoughts. 
I took a breath, waited for the fa- 
miliar throb of pain between my 
temples, the first swell of the sea- 
sickness in my stomach; nothing 
happened. I got my eyes open and 
glanced over at my left arm; it was 
strapped to a board, swathed in 
bandages to the wrist, bristling with 
metal clips and festooned with tub- 
ing. 

In sudden panic, I moved the 
fingers of the hand projecting from 
the bandages. They twitched, flexed 
awkwardly. With an effort, I reach- 
ed across with my right hand, touch- 
ed the smooth skin of the knuckles 
of the other. Under my fingers, the 
texture was cool, inhumanly glossy; 
the cold gloss of polyon. I raked at 
the bandages, tore them back — 

An inch below the wrist, the 
pseudo-skin ended. A pair of gleam- 
ing metal rods replaced the familiar 
curve of my forearm. 

A sort of animal whimper came 
from my throat. I clenched my lost 
fist — and the artificial hand com- 
plied. I fell back, feeling a numb- 
ness spread from the dead hand all 
through me. I was truncated, spoil- 
ed, less-than-whole. I made an ef- 
fort to sit up, to tear free from the 
restraining straps, wild ideas of re- 
venge boiling up inside me — 

I was as weak as a drowned kit- 
ten. I lay, breathing hoarsely, getting 
used to the idea . 

The Station Monitor’s level voice 
broke into the silence:

IF 




*^Emergency override now con- 
duded. Resuming normal briefing 
procedure.” There was a pause; then 
the voice went on in its tone of im- 
perturbable calm: 

“Indicate whether full status brief- 
ing is required; if other, state de- 
tails of requirement.” 

“How long have I been uncon- 
scious?” I croaked. My voice was 
weak, but understandable. 

“Question requires a value assess- 
ment of non-objective factors; au- 
thorization requested.” 

“Never mind. How long have I 
been here?” 

“Eighteen hours, twenty-two min- 
utes, six seconds, mark. Eight hours, 
twe — ” 

“Close enough,” I cut in. “What’s 
been happening?” 

“On the basis of the initial en- 
cephalogrammatic pattern, a pre- 
liminary diagnosis of massive ana- 
phylactic shock coupled with acute 
stage four metabolic — ” 

“Cancel. I don’t need the grue- 
somer details. You’ve hacked off my 
arm, replaced it with a hook, clear- 
ed out the infection, and gotten the 
fever down. I guess I’m grateful. 
But what are the dog-things doing 
up above?” 

There was a long silence, with just 
the hum of an out-of-kilter carrier. 
Then: “Question implies assumption 
at variance with previously acquired 
two-valued data.” 

“Can’t you give me a simple an- 
swer?” I barked weakly. “Have they 
started to dig?” 

“Question implies acceptance at 
objective physical level of existence 
and activities of phenomenon classi- 



fied as subjective. Closed area. Ques- 
tion cannot be answered.” 

“Wait a minute — you’re telling 
me that the four-handed monsters 
and the fake humans that work with 
them are imaginary?” 

“To avoid delays in responses, do 
not employ slang or unusual con- 
structions. All data impinging on 
subject area both directly and in- 
directly, including instrument-ac- 
quired statistical material, photo- 
graphic and transmitted images, au-

tive; B, produced negative hallucina- 
tory reactions resulting in inability 
of Operators to perceive read-outs; 
or, C, been followed by mental 
breakdown, unconsciousness or 
death of Operators.” 

“In other words, whenever you’ve 
reported anything on the demons the 
listeners either didn’t believe you, 
couldn’t see or hear your report, or 
*~went insane or died.” 

“Affirmative.” 

“Has . ah . anything started 
to dig? Are there any evidences of 
excavation work xsp above?” 
“Negative.” 

“Can the presence of diis station 
be detected using a mass-discont - 
uity-type detector?” 

“Negative; the station is probe- 
neutral.” 

I let out a long breath. “What is 
this place?” I asked. “Who built 
it? And when?” 

“Station twelve was completed in 
1926. It has been periodically added 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



85 




to since that time. It is one of a 
complex of fifty survival stations 
prepared by the Ultimax Group.” 
“What’s the Ultimax Group?” 
“An elite inner circle organization, 
international in scope, privately 
financed, comprising one hundred 
and fourteen individuals selected on 
the basis of superior intellectual en- 
dowment, advanced specialist train- 
ing, emotional stability and other 
factors.” 

“For what purpose?” 

“To monitor trends in the Basic 
Survival Factors, and to take such 
steps as may be required to main- 
tain favorable societal survival ra- 
tio.” 

“1 never heard of them. How long 
have they been operating?” 

“Tw^o hundred and seventy-one 
years.” 

“My God! Who started it?” 

“The original Committee included 
Benjamin Franklin, George Loffitt, 
Danilo Moncredi and Cyril Ste. 
Claire.” 

“And Felix Severance was a 
member?” 

“Affirmative.” 

“And they don’t know about — 
the non-objective things up above?” 
“Question indeterminate, as it re- 
quires an assumption at variance 
with — ” 

<ay — cancel. You said there 
are other stations. Can I get in 
touch with them?” 

“State the number of the station 
with which you desire to communi- 
cate.” 

“What’s the nearest one to Jack- 
sonville?” 

“Station nineteen, Talisman, Flor- 



ida. Contact now open, on Number 
three screen.” 

One of the previously blank panels 
opposite me glowed into life, show- 
ed me a view of a room similar in 
many particulars to Station twelve, 
except that its basic decor was a 
trifle more modern — the stainless 
steel of the early Atomic Era. 

“Anybody home?” I called. 

There was no reply. I tried the 
other stations successively. None an- 
swered. 

“That’s that,” I said. “Tell me 
more about this Ultimax Group. 
What’s it been doing these past 
couple of hundred years?” 

“It contributed materially to the 
success of the American War of In- 
dependence, the defeat of the Na- 
poleonic Empire, the consolidation 
of the Italian and German nations, 
the emergence of Nippon, the defeat 
of the Central Powers in the First 
Engagement of the European War, 
and of the Fascist Powers in the 
Second Engagement, and the estab- 
lishment of the State of Israel. It 
supported the Space effort . .” 

I was beginning to, feel a little 
ragged now; the first fine glow was 
fading. I listened to the voice for 
another half-hour, while it told me 
all about the little-known facts of 
history; then I dismissed it and took 
another nap. 

XIV 

y ate, slept and waited. After four- 
teen hours, the straps holding 
my arm released themselves; after 
that, I practiced tottering up and 
down my prison, testing my new

jurm, and now and then tuning in 
on what went on overhead. For the 
most part, there was silence, broken 
only by the sounds of nature and 
the slap and thump of pacing feet. 
I heard a few gobbled conversations, 
and once an exchange between a 
humanoid and a demon: 

"7/ has means of escaping pur- 
suit” the flat voice was saying as 1 
picked it up. ^*This is the same one 
that eluded our units at location 
totter- pohl” 

Angry sounds from a demon . 
*'That is not my area of surveil- 
lance,” the first voice said coldly. 
*^My work is among the men” 
Another alien tongue-lashing. 

reports are negative; the in- 
struments indicate nothing — ” 

An excited interruption. 

**When the star has set, then. / 
must call in more units . .” The 
voice faded, going away. 

“Monitor, it’s time for me to start 
making plans. They’re getting rest- 
less up above. I’m going to need a 
few things: clothes, money, weapons, 
transportation. Can you help me?” 
“State your requirements in de- 
tail.” 

“I need an inconspicuous civilian- 
type suit, perferably heated. I’ll also 
need underwear, boots and a good 
hand-gun; one of those Borgia Spec- 
ials Felix gave me would do nicely. 
About ten thousand cees in cash — 
some small bills, the rest in hun- 
dreds. I want a useful ID — and a 
good map. I don’t suppose you could 
get me an OE suit and a lift belt, 
but a radar-negative heli would be 
verv useful. A high-speed, armored 
]oh” 

Within half an hour the delivery 
THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



bin had disgorged a complete ward- 
robe, including a warm, sturdy, and 
conservatively cut suit with a special 
underarm pocket In which the need- 
ier nested snugly. My wallet bulged 
with nicely aged bills. I had a late- 
model compass-map strapped to my 
wrist, a card identifying me as a 
Treasury man, and a special key 
tucked in an inner pocket that 
would open the door to a conceal- 
ed Ultimax motor depot near Inde- 
pendence, less than thirty miles 
away. 

At regular intervals, the Station 
Monitor gave instructions for treat- 
ment, keeping tabs on my condition 
by means of an array of remote- 
sensing instruments buried in the 
walls. My strength was returning 
slowly. The arm was a marvel of 
bio-prosthetics. The sight of the 
stark, functional chromalloy radius 
and ulna gave me a strange, un- 
pleasant sensation every time I saw 
h, but I was learning to use it; as 
die nerve-connections healed, I was 
even developing tactile sensivity in 
the fingertips. 

When the chronometer on the 
wall showed that I had been in the 
underground station for forty-nine 
hours that seemed like weeks I made 
another routine enquiry on condi- 
tions up above. 

“How about k, Monitor?” I call- 
ed. “Any signs of excavation work 
going on up there?” 

There was a long pause — as 
there was every time I asked ques- 
tions around the edges of the For- 
bidden Topic. 

“Negative,” the voice said at last. 

“Can you get a message out to 
somebody for me?” 



87 




“Affirmative, assuming — ” 

“Skip the assumptions. He’s some- 
where in Jacksonville, Florida — 1 
hope — assuming the demons didn’t 
kill him just to keep in practice. His 
name’s Joel — last name unknown, 
even to him. Address unknown. As 
of a week ago, he was crewman 
aboard a sub-tanker called the Ex- 
calihur, out of New Hartford. Find 
him, and tell him to meet me at the 
main branch of the YMNA in . 
where’s the nearest diplomatic post?” 
“The British Consulate at Chi- 
cago.” 

“All right; I want Joel to meet 
me in the lobby of the main Y in 
Chicago, as soon as he can get there. 
Do you think you can reach him 
with what I’ve given you?” 

“Indeterminate. Telephone con- 
nections can be made with — ” 

There was a loud, dull -toned 
thump: that shook. the station. The 
Monitor’s voice wavered and went 
on: “ — all points on — ” Another 
thud. 

I was on my feet, watching micro- 
scopic dust particles shaken out of 
crevices by the impact, settling on 
the floor. There was another blow, 
more severe than the others. “What 
the Hell was that?” I asked — yell- 
ed — but it was rhetorical; I knew 
the answer. The demons were at my 
door. 

4 4 A 11 right, . talk fast. Monitor,” 
I barked. I pulled on my 
clothes as I talked, checked the gun. 
“Is there any other route out of 
here?” 

“The secondary exit route leads 
from the point now indicated by the 



amber light,” the voice said imper- 
turbably. Across the room, I saw 
an indicator blink on, off, on. 
“However,” the Monitor went on, 
“departure from the Station at this 
time is not advised. You have not 
yet recovered full normal function. 
Optimum recovery rate will be ob- 
tained by continued bed rest, con- 
trolled diet, proper medication, and 
minimal exertion — ” I interrupted 
it. 

“You’re developing a nagging 
tone,” I told it. “Get that door 
open. Monitor, I assume you’re 
mined for destruction?” I asked get- 
ting more anxious. 

“Affirmative.” 

“Wait until the last minute — un- 
til there’s a nice crowd of curious 
zombies and other non-existent pho- 
nomena around; then blow. Under- 
stand?” 

“Affirmative,” the voice said 
calmly. 

I went to the narrow exit panel, 
paused and looked around at the 
chamber. 

“So long,” I called. 

There was no answer. I stepped 
through into the narrow corridor 
that led endlessly down, emerged 
into icy-cold, dusty-smelling dark- 
ness. Helis were parked there. I 
selected one, activated its circuit, 
saw a dome overhead slide open as 
it began to move. An arctic wind 
slashed at me. 

I had gone perhaps a mile, when 
a sudden glare erupted into the sky 
from over the brow of the low 
ridge. 

A column of red-lit smoke boiled 
upward.

J ust after sunrise, a small all-day- 
for-a-cee parking raft anchor- 
ed two miles off Chicago accepted 
my heli with a reassuring sneer of 
indifference. I took the ski-way 
ashore, rode a walkaway half a mile 
to the block-square cube of unwash- 
ed glass which housed the five- 
thousand-bed dormitory of the 
Young Men’s Nondenominational 
Association. I left word for Joel, 
asked for and received one of the 
six-by-eight-foot private cubicles, 
dropped a half-cee in the slot for a 
breakfast-table edition pictonews, 
and settled down to wait, with no 
more than a modest hope that my 
last instruction to the Station moni- 
tor would bear fruit in the form 
of the unfortunate Joel, a good- 
natured giant with the intelligence 
of an alert five year old, but with 
the invaluable ability to detect the 
presence of prowling demons at a 
distance of a full half-mile. 

Hours slipped by while I slept — 
a restless sleep, from which I awoke 
with a start, again and again, hear- 
ing the creak of the floor, the rattle 
of a latch along the corridor. I 
wasn’t hungry; the thought of food 
made my stomach knot. There was 
a taste in my mouth like old gym 
shoes, and a full set of nausea-and- 
headache symptoms hovered in the 
wings, ready to come on at the first 
hint of encouragement. I shaved 
once, staring at a grim, hollow- 
cheeked face in the mirror — a face 
that belonged to a stranger who had 
done a long stretch in a tough pri- 
son on a false charge. The plastic 



surgery scars were pale lines now, 
but the shortened nose, lowered hair- 
line, blue eyes and pale crew-cut still 
looked as unnatural to me as a 
halloween falseface. 

I tried to estimate how long it 
might be before Joel arrived — if he 
arrived. It had been five hours 
since I had given the order to the 
Monitor. A message would have 
gone out to Station Nine, the Moni- 
tor there would have connections 
with a telefax or visiscreen switch- 
board. The order would have gone 
to a leg-man — perhaps an ordin- 
ary messenger service, or a private 
detective agency. Someone would 
have followed the slim leads, check- 
ed out the habitual hangouts where 
Joel spent his time between voy- 
ages. It was safe to assume that he 
was a creature of fixed habit. Once 
the message — with funds, I hoped 
— was delivered, Joel would be 
steered to a tube or jet station. Allow 
two hours for the passage, another 
hour for him to discover the cross- 
town kwik-stop . 

The arithmetic always gave the 
same answer: he should have been 
here an hour or two after I arrived. 
I called the desk again. Nothing. 

I got off the bed, groaning; aches 
were beginning to creep through the 
armor of drugs that were keeping 
me going. It was time to move — 
Joel or no Joel. I had a plan — not 
much of one, but the best I could 
do, alone. 

I dressed, went down to the vast, 
echoing lobby — as cheery as a gas 
chamber. A few hundred derelicts 
lounged in rump-spnmg chairs park- 
ed on patches of dusty rug like is- 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

lands in a sea of plastic flooring the 
color of dried mud. I crossed to the 
mformation desk, opened my mouth 
— and saw Joel stretched out in a 
chair like a battered boxer between 
rounds, eyes shut, mouth open, an 
electric blue scarf knotted around 
his thick neck like a hangman’s 
noose. 

I felt my face cracking into a 
wide grin. I went over to him, shook 
him gently, then a little harder. His 
eyes opened. He looked at me blank- 
ly for a moment — his eyes like the 
windows of an empty house; then 
he smiled, an expression as innocent 
as an infant offering sticky candy. 

“Hi, Jones,” he said, sitting up. 
“Boy, you should’ve seen the train 
I rode in! It was all fancy, and 
there was this nice lady . ”He 
told me all about it while we grip- 
ped hands, grinning. Suddenly, now, 
it was all right. Luck was still with 
me. The demons had tried — tried 
hard — but I was here, still alive, 
iron hand and all — and I wasn’t 
alone. I felt a hint of spring return 
to my muscles, the first twings of 
hunger in days. 

“Joel, there’s a job I have to do,” 
I said. “I want you to help me with 
it.” He nodded, incurious but eager 
to please. Talking, we crossed the 
vast floor and went out into the 
winter street. 

T he British Consulate, perched 
on piles on the shore of Lake 
Michigan, was a weather-stained 
cube of stone filigree done in the 
sterilized Hindu style that had been 
a popular cliche back in the nineties. 
There were lights beyond the grill- 



work in the wide entry, and on the 
upper floors. We walked past once, 
then turned, came back, went up the 
wide, shallow steps, past a steaming 
fountain of recirculated heated water 
glimmering in a purple spotlight, 
rattled the tall grill. A Royal Marine 
three-striper in traditional dress 
blues got up from a desk, came 
across the wide marble floor to the 
gate, fingering the hilt of a cere- 
monial sabre. 

“The Consulate opens at ten I. 
M.” he said, looking me over 
through the grille. 

“My name’s Jones,” I said. “Trea- 
sury. I’ve got to see the Duty Of- 
ficer — now. It can’t wait until 
morning.” 

“Let’s see a little identification, 
sir,” the Marine said. 

I showed him the blue Class One 
I. D. He nodded, handed the I. D. 
back through the grill, got out a 
key, opened up. 

“That’s Mr. Phipps. I’ll ring him. 
You’ll ’ave to wait ’ere.” 

I nodded, stood where I could 
see the approach to the building 
while the Sergeant went to a desk, 
dialed, talked briefly. A second 
Marine came along the corridor, 
took up a position opposite me. He 
was a solidly built red-head, not 
over eighteen. He looked at me with 
a face as expressionless as a court- 
house clock. 

“E’s coming down,” the Sergeant 
said. 

There was sound of feet coming 
leisurely down the winding stair-case 
on my left; a sad-looking tweed- 
suited man with thinning gray hair 
and pale blue eyes in wrinkled pock-

cts came into view, slowed when he 
saw me. He glanced 'at the Marine. 

'‘What’s this all about, Sergeant?” 
he said in a tired voice, like some- 
one who has put up with a lot 
lately and expects more of the same. 

“Somebody to see you,” the Ser- 
geant said. “Sir,” he added. The 
newcomer looked at me suspiciously. 

“I have some important informa- 
tion to report, Mr. Phipps,” I said. 

“Just who are you, might I in- 
quire?” Phipps asked. His expression 
indicated that whatever I said, he 
wouldn’t be pleased. 

“U. S. Treasury.” I showed him 
the I. D. 

He nodded, looked past me out 
through the heavy grillwork. “You 
may as well come along to the of- 
fice.” 

1 followed him to the second 
floor, along a wide, still, corridor 
of dark offices, into a lighted room 
with sexless furnishings in the in- 
ternational official medium-plush 
style. Joel stood beside me, gaping 
at a picture of Queen Anne on the 
wall. 

44T won’t bore you with details, 

X Mr. Phipps,” I said. “I’ve ob- 
served some very odd goings-on. It 
sounds curious, I know, but . 
well, it involves a rather unusual 
dog.” I watched his expression 
closely. He was eyeing me with a 
bored expression that suggested that 
this was about what he’d expect 
from cranks who rattled the grill at 
a late hour. 

He patted back a yawn. 

“Just how are British interests 
involved, Mr. ah . Jones?” 



“This dog was intelligent,” I 
bored on. 

“Well!” His eyebrows went up. 
“I’m sure I don’t . .” His eyes 
went to the door. Footsteps were 
coming along the hall. I turned. A 
husky-looking, black-haired man 
with deep -set dark eyes came into 
the room, looked at me, ignoring 
Phipps. I saw the Marine in the hall 
behind him. I didn’t need a second 
glance to know I had found what I 
was looking for. I felt my pulse start 
to beat a little faster. 

“What is it you want here?” he 
snapped, not bothering with pre- 
liminaries. 

“Ah, Mr. Clomesby-House, Mr. 
Jones, of the American Treasury De- 
partment,” Phipps said, sitting up 
in his chair. He ducked his head, 
adjusting a look of alert interest on 
his dried-out features. I surmised 
that Clomesby-House was his boss. 

“Mr. Jones was just lodging a 
complaint regarding a . um . • 
dog,” Phipps started 

Clomesby-House narrowed his 
eyes at me. “What dog is this?” he 
rapped out. 

“Well,” I laughed diffidently. “It 
sounds pretty silly, here in a nice 
clean office — but some pretty odd 
things have been happening to me 
lately. They all seem to center 
around the dogs . .” 

He waited. 

“It’s a secret spy network — I’m 
sure of it,” I went on. “I have plenty 
of evidence. Now, I don’t want you 
to just take my word for it. I have 
a friend who’s been helping me — ” 

His dark eyes went to Joel. “This 
man knows of this, too?”

“Oh, he’s Qot the one 1 meant. He 
just gave me a lift over. These dogs

“You have seen them — often?” 

“Well, every now and again.” 

“And why did you come here — 
to the British Consulate?” 

“I’m coming to that part. You see 
— well, actually, it’s a little hard 
to explain.” 

I looked anxious — like a nut 
who wants to reveal the location of 
a flying saucer, but is a little shy 
about butterfly nets. “If you could 
possibly spare the time — I’d like 

you to meet my friend. It’s not far 
>1 

He was still squinting at me. His 
fingers squeaked as he tensed them 
against the desk-top. I remembered 
Julius exhibiting the same manner- 
ism — a nervous habit of the not- 
men when they had a decision to 
make. I could almost hear him think- 
ing: it would be simplicity itself for 
him to summon the strait-jacket 
crew, let them listen to my remarks 
about intelligent dogs, and let nature 
take its course. But on the other 
hand, what I had to say just might 
alert someone, cause unwelcome in- 
quiries, invite troublesome poking 
about ... He gave a Prussian nod. 
“As you wish. Come along.” 

XVI 

F orty-five minutes later, with my 
nose against the glass, I stared 
down at a vast expanse of unbroken 
blackness spread out below. It was 
the Yerkes National Forest. 

“This is the place,” I said. “Set 
her down right here. 



Clomesby-House shot me a look 
which would have curdled spring 
water. “Here?” he growled. I nod- 
ded brightly; it was as good a place 
as any for what I had in mind. He 
hissed, angled the heli sharply down- 
ward. I could sense that he was be- 
ginning to regret his excessive cau- 
tion in whisking me away to a lone- 
ly place where he could deal with 
me and my imaginary accomplice 
privately. He had wasted time and 
fuel on a pair of soft, feeble humans. 

Clomesby-House was either an 
excellent pilot or a fool; he whipped 
the heli in under the spreading 
branches of a stand of hundred-foot 
hybrid spruce, grounded it without 
a jar, slammed a door open, letting 
in a wintry blast, and climbed out. 
The landing lights burned blue-white 
pools on the patchy snow, flickering 
as the rotor blades spun to a stop. 

“Stay behind me, Joel,” I said 
quickly. “No matter what happens, 
don’t interfere. Just keep alert for 
the dog-things; you understand?” 

He gave me a startled look. “Are 
they gonna come here, Jones . .?” 

“I hope not ...” I jumped out, 
stood facing Clomesby-House. Be- 
hind me, Joel hugged himself, star- 
ing around at the great trees. 

“Very well,” the not-man said, his 
black eyes probing me like cold 
pokers. “Where is the other man?” 
He stood in a curious slack position, 
like a mannikin that hasn’t been 
positioned by the window dresser. 
Out here, with just two soon-to-be- 
dead humans watching, it wasn’t 
necessary to bother with the all 
troublesome details of looking hu- 
man. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

I went close to him, stared into 
bis all-too-perfect face. 

“Never mind all that,” I said. “It 
was just a come-on. It’s you I want 
to talk to. Where did you come 
from? What do you want on Earth?” 

All the expression went out of his 
face then. He stood for a moment, 
as though considering a suggestion 

I know the signs; he was com- 
muning with another inhuman brain- 
somewhere not too distant. I step- 
ped to him quickly, hit him in the 
pit of the stomach with all my 
strength. He bounced back like a 
tackle dummy hit by a swinging 
boom, crashed against a tree-trunk, 
rebounded — still on his feet. In the 
instant of contact, I had felt some- 
thing break inside him — but it 
wasn’t slowing him down. He 
launched himself at me, hands out- 
stretched, the arrogance of the in- 
vulnerable alien, still not under- 
standing that this time the man be- 
fore him was something more than 
mere victim. I met him with a 
straight right smash to the head that 
spun him, knocked him to the 
ground. He scrambled, sending 
great gouts of frozen mud and 
snow flying, came to his feet. 

The thing shaped like a man 
came toward me, expressionless, 
one arm hanging, the other raised, 
hand flattened for an axeblow. 
I raised an arm, took an impact 
like a trip-hammer on my steel 
arm, countered with a smashing 
chest-punch. It was a waste of ef- 
fort; the thing’s thoracic area was 
armored like a dinosaur’s skull. It 
brought its arm around in a swipe 



that caught me glancingly across the 
shoulder, sent me reeling . 

Joel was between us, huge fists 
ready; he landed a smashing left 
that would have felled an ox, fol- 
lowed with a right that struck the 
cold, smooth face like a cannonball; 
the creature seemed not to notice. 
It struck out, and Joel went skid- 
ding. Then the thing was past him, 
charging for me. Joel’s diversion 
had given me the necessary moment 
to set myself. I caught the descend- 
ing arm in a two-handed grip, haul- 
ed it around, broke it across my 
chest, hurled the alien from me, 
then, as it tripped and fell, aimed a 
kick that caught it just on the knee- 
cap. It went down then, and I stood 
over it, breathing hard, as it thresh- 
ed helplessly, silently, trying to rise 
on its broken leg. 

44T^on’t struggle,” I got out be- 

1 — /tween breaths. “That wouldn’t 
be logical, would it? Now it’s time 
for you to tell me a few things: 
where did you come from? What 
world?” 

It lay still then, a broken toy, 
no longer needed. “You will die 
soon,” it said flatly. 

“Maybe; meanwhile just call me 
curious. Where’s your headquarters? 
Who runs things, you or the dogs? 
What do you do with the men you 
steal — or their brains?” 

“Information is of no use to the 
soon-dead,” the flat voice stated in- 
differently. 

Behind me, Joel moaned, a thin, 
high wail of animal torment. I 
whirled to him. He lay, oddly 
crumpled, at the base of a giant

IF 




tree, his face white, shocked. Blood 
ran from his mouth. I went to him, 
knelt. The front of his shirt was a 
sodden mass of bloody fabric. The 
thing’s blow had smashed his chest 
as effectively as a falling safe. 

^Toel. hold on . I’ll get you to 
a doctor!” I eased my arms under 
him. started to life. 

He shrieked and twisted once. 

“It tickles in my head,” he whim- 
pered. “I don’t like it when it tick- 
les in my head.” His eyes fell on 
me. “I can’t get up, Jones,” he said. 
“Please help me get up . .” 

“Don’t trv to move, Joel. You’re 
hurt inside.” 

“I don’t want the dogs to come, 
Jon^s. I’m afraid.” 

“The dogs?” I felt my scalp tight- 
en. “Here? Are you sure?” I twist- 
ed. staring into the deep forest all 
around, saw nothin^. “Come on, 
Joel: I’m going to lift you into the 
heli . .” T put a hand under his 
back, half-lifted him. He screamed 
hoarsely. I lowered him. 

“It hurts too bad, Jones,” he 
gasned out. “I’m sorry . 

“Where are the dogs, Joel? How 
long before they’ll be here?” 
“They’re close, Jones . 

.1 whirled on the broken man- 
thing. “How far away are they?” I 
mapped. “You called them; how 
long before they’ll be here?” 

It looked at me with the one eye 
that remained in its battered head, 
said nothing. I kicked it in the side, 
hard enough to hurt my foot, sent 
the limp body skidding two yards. 

“Talk, damn you!” It merely 
looked at me, as impersonally as a 
morgue attendant taking inventory. 



Its gaze went past me; it seemed to 
be listening . 

Then I felt it — the greasy, gray 
feeling of unreality that meant the 
demons were closing on the attack. 
I keened my hearing . 

I heard the lope of demonic 
hands, galloping across frozen 
ground, brushing against brittle, leaf 
less twigs, coming closer. 

“You . gotta . hurrv 

. up . .” Joel’s voice croaked. 
“G-by, Jones You was ... a good 
friend. I guess you was ... the 
only friend ... I ever had . .” 

I looked at him. He was dying: I 
knew that nothing I could do 
would save him. And a few feet 
away, the heli waited, fuelled, ready 
to go. In three steps I could be in 
if, lifting off to leave the demon* 
horde clashing their jaws in frus- 
trated fury. I would be free then 
to contact the Ultimax Group, 
carry on the fight . 

I took a step toward the heli, and 
my eyes fell on Joel’s face — the 
face of a child, afraid, but trying 
not to show it. And I remembered 
Felix, whom I had left alone, to 
die beneath a tidal wave of horror 

“Take it easy, Joel,” I said. My 
voice was hoarse. “I’m not leav- 
ing. I’m staying with you.” 

He opened his mouth to say 
something, but no sound came out. 

There was a crash of underbrush 
and I whirled. A dark dog-shape 
bounded from the shadow of a giant 
tree, skidded to a halt, then charged 
into the circle of light. I set my- 
self, waited — and as it leaped. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

threw my weight into a straight- 
arm blow that met the scraped-bonc 
face in mid-air, drove it back in 
pulped ruin into the shattered skull. 
The thing hurtled past me, struck, 
threshing in its death-fit. Two more 
of the beast-things leaped into view, 
sprang at me side by side. I jumped 
to meet them, caught one by the 
neck, crushed bone and hide to- 
gether, hurled it aside, turned to 
drive a kick into the chest of the 
second. 

There were more of them around 
me now; I spun, kicked at one, 
struck another down with my 
chromalloy fist, shook a third from 
my right arm, fended off another 
... It was a nightmare battle 
against leaping creatures almost im- 
palpable to my PAPA reinforced 
blows; they came at me like bound- 
ing ghost-shapes, red-eyed and gape- 
jawed, and I struck, and struck . 

A white hot bear-trap closed on 
my leg, I tried to shake it off. It 
clung, dragging at me. Then I was 
down, and the weight on me was 
like heaped mattresses set with 
needles of fire; I thought of a man 
drowning in a sea of piranha, raz- 
or teeth stripping the flesh from 
the living bone. 

I felt the tearing of flesh. As in a 
dream, I heard the gobble of demon 
voices, the slap of beast hands. And 
then the blackness that I knew was 
death closed over me. 

XVII 

S omewhere, I dream in a sunless 
emptiness. The years arch over 
the long avenue of time, 

96 



Into the static Universe, change 
comes^ I sense movement, the slide 
and turn of intricate components, 
and the tentative questing of sensors, 
like raw nerves hesitantly exposed. 
Light, form, color, impinge on de~ 
licate instruments. Space takes on 
dimension, texture. 

All around me a broad plain of 
shattered rock and black shadows 
stretches away to a line of fire at 
the edge of the world, under the 
glare of a sun that rages purple- 
white against bottomless silver-black. 

A shape moves, small with dis- 
tance — and beyond it, others. I 
am moving, too, driving forward ef- 
fortlessly over the rough ground, 
throwing up dust in heavy clouds 
that drop back with a curious quick- 
ness. Rock-chips fly, twinkling as 
they fall. I sense vibrations; the 
thunder of my passage, the whine 
and growl of meshing metal, the 
oscillation of electrons. 

Abruptly, from beyond the jagged 
horizon, an object comes, a glittering 
torpedo-shape tipped with blue fire, 
flashing with a swiftness that swells 
it in a moment to giant size. I 
feel the closing of rays within me; 
circuits come alive. My back arch- 
es; I left my arms and thrust — 

Fire lances from my fingertips, 
a silent stuttering of brilliance across 
the spangled sky. I pivot, trailing 
the shattered projectile as it gouts 
incandescence, breaks apart, falls in 
fragments beyond a distant stony 
ridge. A growl of thunder rolls, dies. 
I rake my eyes across the desolate 
spread of fragmented shale around 
me, mark a flicker of movement 
among up-tilted rock-slabs, point and 

IF 




fire in one smooth corordwaied 
motion . 

Ana still I plunge on, charging 
to a blind attack against an unknown 
enemy. 

I grina down a long slope, doz- 
ing aside rock-chunks, jolting across 
crevasses. A vast shape swings from 
an inky shadow to ^y left, pivots 
heavily, trailing a shattered tread. A 
dreadnought of the enemy, damaged, 
left behind in the retreat, but with 
her offensive power intact. / see the

at it and see’ its exposed grid shat--

/ turn back slowly to rejoin my 
column. Tne battle continues. 

4 4T JNIT EIGHTY-FOUR! DAM- 
AGE REPORT!” 

The words flash into my mind 
like the silent blow of a bright axe, 
not spoken in English, hut spat in 
an abbreviated Command Code of 
harsh inflected syllables. I hear my- 
self acknowledge the order in kind, 
as an instant compulsive response 
my damage sensors race through a 
fifty -thousand-item checklist like 
rats scurrying among filled shelves. 



Negative,** I hear myself report. 

All systems functional.** 

But deep inside me a dam strains, 
cracks, bursts. A tendril of released 
thought, startled awake by the com- 
mand, seems to grope, struggling 
outward. Word-images, sharp-chis- 
eled as diamonds, thrust among the 
bodiless conceptualizations of' rote 
conditioning. I reach back, hack — 
to the blinding light of a strange 
awakening, past confusion and 
dawning awareness . back . 
into a bland, ever-dwindling record 
of stimulus, pain, stimulus, pleasure; 
a wordless voice that speaks, in- 
structs, impresses, punishes, rewards 
— printing on my receptive mind the 
skein of conditioned reflex, the teach- 
ings that convert the blanked pro- 
toplasm of the shocked brain into 
the trained battle-computer of a 
dreadnought of the line . 

And in the forefront of my mind, 
I am remembering, somewhere long 
ago, a body — of flesh and blood, 
soft, feeting, complex, infinitely re- 
sponsive. 

A target flashes, and I aim and 
fire. 

That impulse had once lifted an 
arm, pointed a finger. A human 
finger. 

A human body. 

I savor the concept, at once 
strange and as familiar as life it- 
self. The fragile concept of identity 
crystallizes from vagueness, grows, 
sharpens — 

There is a moment of disorienta- 
tion, a swirling together and a rend- 
ing apart. 

I am a man. A man named Bra- 
vais. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

C4TTNIT EIGHTY-FOUR! RE- 
U CHECK NAVIGATIONAL 
GRID FOR GROSS POSITIONAL 
ERROR!” 

The habit of obedience carried 
me forward over rough ground, 
maneuvering in response to long- 
learned rules as rigid as laws of na- 
ture. My sensors lanced out, I locked 
to my fellow machines. My control 
mechanisms acted, swinging me to 
the point of zero-stress, then driving 
me forward. 

In my mind, thoughts jostled each 
other: 

Secondary target, track! . // you 
meet another Julius, break him in 
two and keep going . advance, as- 
sault speed . this is your Station 
Monitor; permission requested to 
multilate the body , . arm all bat- 
teries; then micro-second alert . 
/ guess you was the only friend I 
ever had — 

Suddenly, vividly I remembered 
the fight with the demons, the 
weight of the stinking bodies that 
bore me down, teeth tearing at my 
throat . ' 

I had seen the enemy at work — 
tfie deft saws, the clever scalpels. 

I remembered the brain of the Al- 
gerian major, lifted from the skull, 
preserved. 

As I was now preserved. 

The demons had killed my body, 
left, it to rot in the forest. But now 
I lived again — in the body of a great 
machine. 

“UNIT EIGHTY-FOUR: RE- 

PORT!” 

The command struck at me, a 



mental impulse of immense power. 
I watched, an observer aloof from 
the action as my conditioned-re- 
sponse complex reacted, sensing the 
fantastic complexity of the work- 
ings of the mobile fort that was 
now my body, 

“RETIRE TO POSITION IN 
SECONDARY TIER!” The harsh 
order galvanized my automatic re- 
sponses in instant obedience. 

On impulse, I intercepted the com- 
mand; then I reached out along my 
circuits, sent out new commands. I 
turned myself, faced the violet sun, 
moved ponderously forward; I 
halted, pivoted, tracked my guns 
across the darkling sky. 

Somehow I had gained control of 
my machine-body. I remembered 
the command — the external voice 
that would have asserted its con- 
trol — 

But instead, it had cued my hyp- 
notically produced reserve person- 
ality-fraction into active control! 

I withdrew, felt the automatics re- 
sume control, moving me off to my 
new station. The enemy was clever, 
and as thorough as death. I had 
been tracked down, killed, chained 
in slavery on a ruined no-man’s 
world; but I had broken the bonds. 

I was alive, master of my fortress- 
body. Free, inside the enemy de- 
fenses. 

L ater — ^hours or days, I had no 
way of calculating time — I 
rumbled down an echoing tunnel 
into a vast cavern, took my place in 
a long line of scarred battle units. 

“UNIT EIGHTY-FOUR: FALL 
OUT!” the command voice bellowed. 



f8 



IF 




I moved forward. Other units 
moved up, stationed themselves on 
cither side of me. A long silence 
grew. I was aware that other orders 
were being given — orders not ad- 
dressed to me, automatically tuned 
out by my trained reflexes. Some- 
thing was going on. 

I made an effort, extended sensi- 
tivity, picked up the transmission: 

" — malfunction! Escort unit 
eighty-four to decontamination 
chamber and stand by during reflex- 
check! Acknowledge and execute!** 
I heard the snick of relays clos- 
ing; I was hearing the internal com- 
mand circuits of my fellow battle 
units. 

“UNIT EIGHTY-FOUR: PRO- 
CEED TO DECONTAMINATION 
CHAMBER!” 

I let my automation-circuits stir 
me into motion; I moved off, listen- 
ing as the command voice gave a 
final instruction to my armed guard: 
** Units eighty-three and eighty- 
five; at first indication of deviant re- 
sponse, trigger destruct circuits!** 

I saw the turrets of the battle- 
wagons beside me swing to cover 
me; their ports slid back, the black 
snouts of infinite repeaters emerged, 
aimed and ready. The command- 
mind had already sensed something 
out of the ordinary in Unit Eighty- 
four. 

I rolled on toward the interroga- 
tion chamber, monitoring the flow 
of reflex-thought in the minds of 
the units beside me — a dull sequence 
of course-correction, alert-reinforce- 
ments, routine functional adjust- 
ments. Carefully, using minimal 
power, I reached out . 



•^nit eighty-three; damage re- 
port!” I commanded. 

Nothing happened. The battle 
units were programmed to accept 
commands from only one source — 
the command voice. 

“Units eighty-three and eighty- 
five; arm weapons; complete pre- 
fire drill!** the command came. 
From beside me, I heard arming 
locks slide open. Together, my 
guards and I entered the cell. 

iiJjNlT EIGHTY-FOUR! DIS- 
ARM AND LOCK ALL 
WEAPONS! RESPONSE-SE- 
QUENCE ALPHA, EXECUTE!” 
the voice of the Interrogator rang 
out. 

I watched as my well-drilled re- 
flexes went through their paces. I 
would have to move with great care 
now; every action was under scru- 
tiny by the enemy. Another com- 
mand came, and as I responded, I 
studied the quality of the Interro- 
gator’s voice. It was different, sim- 
pler, lacking the overtones of em- 
otion of the Command-mind. 

I reached out my awareness to- 
ward it, sensed walls of armor, the 
complex filaments of circuitry. I 
followed a communications lead 
which trailed off underground to a 
distant bunker. The intricacy of a 
vast computer lay exposed before 
me. I probed gently, testing the 
shape and density of the mechan- 
ical mind-field; it was a poor thing, 
a huge but feeble monomaniac — 
but it was linked to memory banks. 

I felt a warning twitch of alarm 
in the moron- circuits, caught the 
shape of an intention — 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

Instantly 1 shunted aside its com- 
mand, struck back to seize control 
of the computer’s limited discre- 
tionary function. Holding firm, f 
traced the location of the destruct- 
assembly which it would have acti- 
vated, found it mounted below my 
brain, disarmed it. Then I instructed 
the Interrogator to continue with 
the routine check-out, and to report 
all normal. 

While it busied itself in idiot 
obedience, I linked myself to its 
memory banks and scanned the 
stored data. 

The results were disappointing. 
The Interrogator’s programming was 
starkly limited, a series of test pat- 
terns for fighting and service ma- 
chines. I withdrew, knowing no 
more than I had of the enemy. 

The Interrogator reported me as 
battle-ready, and, on command, 1 
rejoined my waiting comrades. An 
order came: ‘‘ALL UNITS, 

SWITCH TO MINIMUM AWARE- 
NESS LEVEL!” 

As the energy quotient in my ser- 
vo-circuits dropped, the sensitivity 
range of my receptors drew in, scan- 
ning from the gamma scale down 
through ultra-violet, past infra-red, 
into the dullness of short-wave. 

Silence and darkness settled over 
the depot. 

I sent out a pulse, scanned the 
space around me. The clatter of 
the command voice was gone. I 
was alone now — I and my coma- 
tose comrades-in-arms. There were 
ninety-one units, similar to myself 
in most respects, but armed with a 
variety of weapons. Small, busy 
machines scurried among us, carry- 



ing out needed repairs. I touched 
one, caught vague images of a sim- 
plified world-image, outlined in 
scents and animal drives. 

I recognized it as the brain of an 
Earthly dog. It had been pro- 
grammed to operate the elementary 
maintenance apparatus. 

Reaching farther, I encountered 
the confused mutter of a far-flung 
communications system, a muted 
surf-roar of commands, acknow- 
ledgements, an incoherent clutter of 
operation messages, meaningless to 
me. 

I touched the mind of the fighting 
machine beside me, groped along the 
dark passages of its dulled nerve- 
complex, found the personality cen- 
ter. A sharp probing impulse elicited 
nothing. The ego was paralyzed. I 
withdrew to its peripheral awareness 
level; a dim glow of consciousness 
lingered there. 

*'Who are you?*' I called. 

^^Unit eighty^three, of the line,” 
the reply was a flat monotone. 

**You were a man once,** I told 
it. *^What was your nameT* 

''Unit eighty-three of the line,” 
the monotone repeated. "Combat* 
ready, standing by at low alerU 
Awaiting orders” 

I tried another; the result was the 
same. 

There was no hint of personality 
in the captive brain. They were com- 
plex neurotronic circuits, nothing 
more. Compact, efficient, with 
trained reflex-patterns, cheaper and 
easier to gather from the warring 
tribes of Earth than to duplicate 
mechanically. 

I stirred another quiescent brain.

probed at the numbed ego, pried 
without success at the opaque shield 
of stunned tissue that surrounds it. 

It was hopeless. I would find no 
allies here — only slaves of the en- 
emy. 

F ree inside the enemy fortress — > 
in a flawless camouflage — I was 
helpless without information. 

I needed to know what and where 
the Command Voice was, the dis- 
position of other brigades, the long- 
range plan of action, who the enemy 
was that we fought on the fire-shat- 
tered plain — and on what world the 
plain lay. I would learn nothing here, 
parked in a subterranean depot. It 
was time to take risks. 

An impulse to my drive mechan- 
uisinow sent me forward out of the 
line-up. I swung around, moved off 
toward the tunnel through which I 
had entered the cave. In the utter 
silence, the clash of my treads 
transmitted through my frame was 
deafening. I filtered out the noise, 
tuned my receptivity for sounds of 
other activity nearby. There were 
none. 

Past the ranked combat units, 
high and grim in the lightless place, 
the tunnel mouth gaped dark. I en- 
tered if, ascended the sloping pas- 
sage, reached a massive barrier of 
flint-steel. I felt for the presence of 
a control-field, sensed the imbecile 
mechanism of the lock. A touch, 
and it responded, sent out the pulse 
that rolled the immense doors back. 
I moved out into the open under a 
blazing black sky. 

I studied the landscape, realizing 
for the first time that my field of 



vision included the entire circum-' 
ference of the horizon. Nothing 
stirred all across the barren waste. 
Here and there the ruins of a com- 
bat unit showed dark against gray 
dust. The flaring purple sun was low 
over the far ridges now; a profusion 
of glittering stars seemed to hang 
close overhead. 

I didn’t know in what direction 
the enemy headquarters might lie. I 
picked a route that led across levd 
ground toward a lone promontory 
and started toward it. 

XIX 

F rom my vantage point atop the 
conical hill, 1 saw the tips of 
saw-toothed peaks that formed a 
wide ring around my position, theii? 
bases out of sight over the near hor- 
izon. 

My sense of scale was confused 
by the strange aspect reality as- 
sumed through unfamiliar senses. 
Instinct told me that the shattered 
slab before me was perhaps five 
yards long. I stirred it with my 
treads, saw it bound away, flip 
lightly over, sink to rest, stirring 
coarse dust which boiled up, dropped 
back like mud under water. 

I was no better at judging my ovm 
size. Was I a vast, multi-tc^ apptf- 
atus, or a tiny fighting maphine no 
bigger than a one-man jet-ped? The 
horizon seemed close. Was it refSHf 
only a mile or two away — or was 
my visual range so far extended 
that a hundred miles seemed only 
a step? 

Self-analysis wasn’t getting me any 
closer to my objective — enemy in-

telligence. Perhaps beyond the . shel- 
ter of the wide crater I would see 
some indications of life. 

I headed for a cleft between steep 
cliffs, churned up through dust that 
fountained behind me, gained the 
pass. The view ahead showed the 
same sterile rock and dust that I had 
left behind me. I went on, down the 
slope and out across the plain, skirt- 
ing bumed-out machines, some of 
fantastic design, others twins to my 
own grim body. I passed small cra- 
ters — whether natural formations or 
the results of bombardment I 
couldn’t tell. The distant babble of 
confused commands was a back- 
ground to the crackle of star- static. 
I felt neither hunger or fatigue — 
only a burning curiosity as to what 
lay beyond the next ridge, and a 
nagging fear that I might be dis- 
covered and destroyed before I had 
taken my revenge for what had been 
done to me . 

The strange machine appeared 
suddenly at the top of a sheer cliff 
that ran obliquely across my route. 
It saw me at the same instant that 
I saw it, pivoted, depressing its guns 
to bear on me. In place of the simple 
markings of the battle units I had 
seen, there were complicated insig- 
nia painted in garish colors across 
ks hull. 

I halted, waiting. 

“IDENTIFY YOURSELF!” the 
familiar voice of my Brigade com- 
mander boomed in my mind. 

''Unit eighty-four of the line, 
combat ready/* As I reported, I ex- 
tended a probing impulse across the 
insubstantial not-space, touched the 
shape of the mind behind the voice. 



With an instantaneous reflex, it 
struck at me. The slave circuits of 
my brain resonated with the power 
of the blow — but in that instant I 
had seen the strange workings of the 
alien mind, scanned the pattern of 
the assault it had hurled at me — 
and now I traced the path of primary 
volition, struck back, caught the en- 
emy ego in an unbreakable grip. 
"Who are you?" I demanded. 

I t gibbered, writhed, fought to es- 
cape; I held it tighter — like grip- 
ping a lashing snake in bare hands. 
"Answer, or I destroy you!" 

"I am Zixz, Centurion of the line, 
of the Nest of the Thousand Agonies 
Suffered Gladly. What Over-mind 
are you . 

"Where do you come from?" 

"I was spawned in the muck beds 
of Kzak, by order of the Bed-mas- 
ter" 

"You're not human. Why were 
you installed in a machine?" 

"I was condemned for the crime 
of inferiority. Here I expiate that 
fault." 

"What world is this?" 

The reply was a meaningless iden- 
tity-symbol. 

"Why do you fight this war?" 
The captive alien mind howled 
out its war slogan — as incompre- 
hensible as an astrologer’s jargon. I 
silenced it. 

"How many Brigades are en- 
gaged?" 

"Four thousand, but not all are 
at full strength." 

"Who is the enemy?" 

The symbol that the alien hurled 
at me was a compound of horrors.

'' Where is your headquarters?** I 
demanded. 

I caught an instant’s glimpse of 
twisted towers, deep caverns, and 
concept: the Place that Must Be De- 
fended. Then the alien lunged against 
my control, shrieked an alarm — 

I tightened my grip and sudden 
silence fell. Cautiously, I relaxed. 
A few threads of dying thought 
spiraled out from the broken mind; 
then it winked out like a quenched 
ember. I had killed the Centurion 
Zixz. 

And into the void, a thunderous 
command roared. 

“COMMAND UNIT ZIXZI 
REPORT YOUR BRIGADE!” 
Quickly I shaped a concept, coun- 
terfeiting the dead Centurion’s mind* 
pattern: '^Brigade strength ninety- 
one; ready for combat.** 

“YOUR NEST WILL SUFFER. 
FOOL! THE OVER-MIND DOES 
NOT COMMAND TWICE! OR- 
DER YOUR UNITS INTO AC- 
TION! CLOSE THE GAP IN THE 
BATTLE ARRAY!” 

**Delayed by necessity for destruc- 
tion of defective unit,** I countered. 
**Proceeding as ordered** 

“COMMAND UNIT ZIXZ 
I PROMISE LIQUID FIRE 
ACROSS THE MUCK BED OF 
ZIXZ FOR THIS DERELIC- 
TION! TO THE ATTACK!” 

I broke in, still feigning the 
mind-voice of Zixz: 

''Massive enemy flanking attack! 
New weapons of unfamiliar capabil- 
ity! Non-detectible units assaulting 
me in overwhelming numbers.** But 
while I transmitted the false report 
to the Over- mind, I extended a deli- 



cate sensing line, brushed over the 
other, felt out the form of a mighty 
intelligence, vastly more powerful 
than that of Zixz. And yet the 
structure was familiar — like that of 
the Centurion, magnified, reinforced. 
And here was the primary volitional 
path. 

I moved along as lightly as a 
spider stalking a gnat, came into a 
vast mind-cavern, ablaze with the 
power of a massive intellect. 

“REINFORCEMENTS DIS- 
PATCHED!” the great mind roared, 
deafening at close range. “RELEASE 
TO YOUR HOME NEST IF YOU 
HOLD! PROCEED WITH ADDI- 
TIONAL DATA!” 

Busily I concocted fantastic mass 
and firepower readings, fanciful 
descriptions of complex and mean- 
ingless enemy maneuvers; and while 
I held the Over-mind’s attention, I 
searched — and found its memory 
vaults. 

T here was the image of a great 
nest, seething with voracious 
life — a nest that covered a world, 
leaped to another, swelled through 
an ever-increasing volume of space, 
driven by lusts that burned like liv- 
ing fire in each tiny mote that com- 
prised the swarming tribe. 

I saw the outward writhing pseu- 
dopods of this burgeoning race as 
they met, slashed at each other with 
mindless fury — and then flowed on, 
over every obstacle, changing, adapt- 
ing to burning suns and worlds of 
ice, to the near-null gravity of tiny 
rock-worlds and the smashing forces 
of titan-planets of collapsed matter. 
The wave reached the edge of its

IF 




galaxy, boiled up, reached out vainly 
over the void — and, defeated, re- 
coiled on itself, churning back to- 
ward Galactic center, stronger now, 
more ruthless, possessed of a vast 
frustrated rage that shrieked its in- 
satiable needs, devouring all in its 
path — and coming together at last 
in an eruption of mad vitality that 
rent the very fabric of space. 

And from the void at the heart of 
the universe, the wave rolled out 
again. It was tempered in the fires of 
uncounted ages of ravening combat, 
up its substance now in a new up- 
surge of violence that made the past 
invasions seem as somnolent as 
spawning pools. 

Again the edge of the galaxy was 
reached, and there the wave built, 
poised — and bridged the gap to the 
next galaxy. Over the slim link, life 
flowed, fighting, slashing, devouring, 
leaping from new feeding ground to 
newer, filling the galaxy, boiling up 
in a transcendent fury of hunger, 
again a leap into nothingness — and 
a new galaxy was reached. 

Nothing remained in the Nest- 
mind of its original character. It 
had become a vast mechanism for 
growth, a disease that radiated out- 
ward from a center so distant in the 
universe that the mind itself in time 
forgot its beginnings. Units broke 
free, withered, faded, died. Random 
islands of the raging vitality con- 
sumed themselves, disappeared. 

A long arm turned back, groped 
its way along the chains of burned- 
out worlds, scavenging, growing, to 
lance in the end into the original 
nest place, to devastate it and go on, 
blind, insensate, insatiable — and find- 



ing no new feeding grounds beyond, 
it turned upon itself. 

I withdrew from the Over-mind, 
and for a moment I held the long 
perspective of that view. I saw my 
world as the insignificant scintilla 
that it was among the stars, my own 
human race a sinister tribe of bar- 
baric freaks, harvested like wild bees. 

A great gleaming planet, had risen 
above the broken horizon, casting a 
bluish light across the darkling pla- 
teau. I saw the gleam of white from 
a misty patch on the overcurve of 
the glaring world, the pale outlines 
of continents. Familiar continents. 

I was looking at the full Earth, a 
quarter of a million miles away in 
space. 

T here was no time now to indulge 
the pangs of homesickness. The 
Over-mind continued to pour out or- 
ders to its dead centurion, and I 
babbled responses, describing the 
maneuvering of immense imaginary 
fleets, fabulous aerial assaults, 
weapons of incredible destructive 
power. And while I transmitted, I 
raced along the base of the cliff to- 
ward the shelter of a distant ring- 
wall. 

In the open now, I saw the dust 
clouds of distant brigades on the 
move, coming closer. I altered 
course, steered for a smaller crater 
almost lost over the curve of the 
lunar horizon. I skirted a vast tum- 
ulus of. broken rock, thundered out 
into the clear — " 

Spread all across my route, a 
full brigade of heavy combat units 
churned toward me under a pall of 
dust. I swung away to the left; at 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

once, a harsh voice rang in my mind: 
“LONE UNIT! WHAT IS YOUR 
BRIGADE?’’ 

I ignored the call, saw a unit de- 
tach itself, race to intercept me. I 
halted, swung to bring my guns to 
bear. I opened my receptors, heard 
a harsh command: 

“RENEGADE UNIT! HALT 
AND SUBMIT OR BE DE- 
STROYED.” 

For a moment, I hesitated, ready 
to pour my fire into the enemy. 

Then I felt the probe of the strang- 
er’s mind reach out to me. 

**Goshr a familiar voice ex- 
claimed in my mind. *'Whafre you 
doin' here, Jones?*^ 

XX 

iinphat’s how it was, Jones,** 
A Joel said. “For a while I 
just watched; I looked at the coun- 
try and tried to figure out where 
I was. All I knew was, I was Unit 
One Hundred of the line — and I 
was Joel, too. But everything was 
different. There was fighting go- 
ing on ’bout all the time. I got 
to worrying maybe Fd get hurt. 
This new body I got’s tough, but a 
direct hit could knock it out — I saw 
it happen to others. I tried to talk 
to some of ’em after I got the 
knack of it. But all they knew was 
their number and the orders of the 
day. 

“Then one day I just ducked out; 
there was so ma*y units in the fight 
I didn’t figure anybody’d notice. I 
been here ever since-^unno how 
long.” 

“How many times has the Earth 



crossed the sky since you woke up?** 
“Maybe six or seven.” 

“Then you’ve been here for 
months — and nothing’s happened 
yet?” 

“Nope. I figured maybe they for- 
got about me.” 

“I don’t think time means the same 
thing to them as it does to us.” 
“This is a funny-looking place, 
ain’t it, Jones? The sun’s funny — 
and the moon, too.” 

“We’re on the moon, Joel. That 
planet you see in the sky is the 
Earth.” 

“Gosh.” 

“Joel. I don’t know how much 
time we’ll have — but I have a feeling 
that when the current battle is set- 
tled, the Over-mind will be along to 
find out why we didn’t work out. I 
think it assumes we’re just a routine 
malfunction. They don’t seem to 
have any emotions. They aren’t out 
for revenge for the centurion I 
killed — but if they knew we were 
in full control of our bodies, we’d 
have been blasted.” 

“Who are they, Jones — the Com- 
mand minds and the Over-mind — 
all these voices I hear in my head?” 
“They’re the masters of the dog- 
things. They’re fighting a war. The 
Devil knows what it’s about.. For 
some reason they’re using our moon 
as a battleground — and we’re a con- 
venient source of computer circuits.” 
“The ones they’re fighting — 
they’re just as bad,” Joel cut in. “I 
got close to ’em once — nearly got 
cut off. I put out a feeler to one — 
wanted to see what he was like. I 
figured maybe if he was against the 
Command voice, maybe I’d change

sides — but it was — it was horrible, 
Jones. Kind of like . well, like 
some of the old ladies that used to 
come around the Seaman’s Welfare. 
They was so bound to do good, 
they d kill you if you got in their 
way. It’s like Hell comes in two col- 
ors — black and white.” 

“We need information, Joel. We’re 
as ignorant as new-born babies. For 
a while, I didn’t even know how 
fast time was going past. I got that 
part straight when I saw the earth 
rise. We move fast — we can run 
through a fifty-thousand item check 
list in a second or two. But I still 
don’t know how big I am.” 

I can tell you how big we are, 
Jones. Come on.” I watched as the 
great battle-machine that had been 
Joel backed, turned, started off along 
the wall. I followed. At the far end 
of the compound, at the junction of 
the barrier wall with a massive 
squat tower, he stopped. 

Look there,” he said. I examined 
the ground, noted the broken rubble, 
a heap of scattered objects like frag- 
ments of broken spaghetti, loose dust 
drifted against the coarse, unjointed 
wall. 

“See them little sticks that got 
a kind of glow to ’em?” Joel said. 

“Sure . 

T hen 1 recognized what I was 
looking at. “My God!” 

“Funny, ain’t it? Them skulls 
don’t look no bigger’n marbles; leg- 
bones like they might belong to a 
mouse. But they’re full-sized human 
bones, Jones. It’s us that’s off. We 
must be, well, ’bout — well, I can’t 
count that high . 



“They look about twelve inches; 
my picture of myself is about twelve 
feet to my upper turret. I can mul- 
tiply that by six; that makes us sev- 
enty-two feet high!” 

“Jones — could you teach me to 
count them big numbers? You know, 
it’s funny — but seems like I missed 
learnin’ a lot of things, back when — 
when I was just a man.” 

“You’ve changed, Joel. You think 
about things a lot more than you 
used to.” 

“I know, Jones. It’s like I used to 
be sort of half-asleep or something. 
I can’t remember much about it — 
back there. It’s all kind of gray and 
fuzzy. There’s lots of things I want 
to know now. Like numbers. But in 
those days, I never even asked.” 
“Joel, how did you get the wound 
you had on your forehead?” 

“Yeah — I remember. There was a 
sore place. It hurt, all the time. 
Gosh, I forgot all about them head- 
aches! And it was kind of pushed 
in, like.” 

“It was a badly depressed frac- 
ture, probably bone fragments press- 
ing on your brain. That pressure’s 
gone now.” 

“It don’t do me much good.” 

I reached out, sensed two ma- 
chines dozing on low alert. “I tried 
to control a couple of units once,” I 
called to Joel. “It didn’t work. But 
I’ve learned a few tricks since then. 
Maybe . ” 

“Maybe what, Jones?” 

“I don’t know — ^but I’m going to 
try something and see what hap- 
pens.” 

I reached out to the dull glow of 
the idling mind-fiekl, formed in my

mind an image of the shape of the 
mental voice of the dead centurion 
Zixz. 

“Combat unit! Damage report!” 
I thundered. 

“All systems functional,” came 
the instant reply. 

“Situation Report!” I demanded. 

“Unit six of the line, standing by 
on low alert!” 

I reached for the other mind, 
touched it; it identified itself as unit 
seven of the Brigade of Ognyx. 

“Units six and seven! Stand by!” 
I roared. 

“Acknowledge,” came the instant 
reply. 

Joel and I raced out onto the 
rock-shattered plain. Half a mile 
distant, the two immense combat 
units sat, guns still bearing on their 
target. 

“Units six and seven!” I trans- 
mitted as I barrelled past. “You are 
now under the command code ‘Talis- 
man’. Your primary function will be 
the protection and assistance of units 
eiehtv-four and one hundred. You 
will not report the existence of 
Talisman to any Command Unit. 
Fall in and follow me.” 

I saw the two huge machines 
obediently start up, wheel into line, 
come up to speed. Together, our 
small force hurled across the stark 
desert under the blue light of a 
warm, green world I would never 
see aggin. 

“Hev. that was neat, Jones,” Joel 
called. “Where we going now?” 

“There’s an underground depot a 
few miles from here. I.et’s see if 
we can reach it before they cut us 



T he enemy was a dust cloud far 
to the east. We, angled west, 
crossed a range of broken ground 
dotted with burned -out hulks, raced 
past the up-thrust fault line where 
the dead centurion Zixz still held his 
silent vigil at the cliffhead, drove for 
the crater wall. Monitoring the com- 
mand band, I heard the clamor of 
orders, an exchange of queries 
among Command units, caught an 
order hurled at the guards I had 
captured : 

“UNITS SIX AND SEVEN! 
REPORT!” 

“Joel — fake up six!” I said quick- 
ly. Then: 

“Standing by at low alert,” I 
transmitted in the monotone of an 
automaton circuit. 

“REPORT STAl US OF AREA!” 
“All quiet,” I transmitted listless- 
ly. 

The crater walls were rising be- 
fore us now; I streaked for the cleft, 
flipped on powerful lights as I en- 
tered the shadows of the pass. Be- 
hind me. Joel and our two recruits 
followed up the rise of ground, 
down onto the plain within the ring- 
wall. I scanned the scene, identified 
the location of the access tunnel, 
roared across up to it and stopped. 

“So far so good, Joel. Wait here 
with six and seven. If I don’t come 
back . good Inck.” I moved for- 
ward into the black mouth of the 
tunnel. 

The units sat in ranks as I had 
left them, silent, ready, their circuits 
idling. There was no time now for 
caution on my part. 

“Combat Units!” I rapped out. 
“You are now under operational

control of Command Unit Talisman! 
Only Talisman commands will be 
obeyed! Order? of the Over-mind 
will not be heard! Full combat alert! 
Prepare for action! First squad, roU 
out!’’ 

Obediently, ten massive fighting 
machines rumbled forward, wheeled 
left into line, advanced toward the 
exit ramp. I preceded them, emerged 
into the open, watched as they filed 
out and took up battle formation. 

“They caught on to where we 
were going, Jones,” Joel called. “I’ve 
been listening; they sent ten units 
over to see what we’re up to!” 

“I’ll take this squad to the pass 
and hold them off, Joel! You get the 
rest of them out!” 

I heard his voice rapping out or- 
ders under the Talisman code as I 
set off for the pass. 

A s I reached the crest of the de- 
file, the interceptor force came 
into view — ten mighty machines, 
glittering under the light of the full 
Earth. At once, a thunderous com- 
mand blasted at me: 

“UNITS, IMMOBILIZE! RE- 
VERT TO STAND-BY ALERT!” 
I reached out, found the grotesque 
form of an alien mind, dealt it a 
smashing blow. 

“Task force, you are now under 
the control of Talisman Command,” 
I roared in imitation of the com- 
mand voice. “Take up positions in 
echelon with Talisman force!” 

Nine of the battle units ac- 
knowledged, moved into the pass, 
leaving their dead leader behind. 
Under our guns, they founted the 
path, took up stations as ordered. 



Far out on the flat, the main body 
was in view, coming up fast. 

“All out, Jones,” Joel’s call came. 
We’re on the way.” 

“Some new volunteers have just 
rallied to the standard,” I called 
back. “Post units at all the passes 
into the crater; we’re going to have 
to defend this position.” 

“If we run for it, we could get 
away clean now, Jones,” Joel 
called. “We could head for way off 
yonder somewhere, and we’d be 
safe ” 

“Safe— for what?” 

“For anything. We could set and 
think, and look up at the stars and 
wonder at ’em, and every now and 
again we could loose off our guns, 
just for the heck of it — ” 

“It’s too late to run for it. But 
we’re not finished yet, Joel. Take 
this bunch over and swear ’em in.” 
I extended awareness, caught a 
fragment of an order: 

“INTERCEPTION! FORCE, RE- 
PORT POSITION!” 

I complied with a confused re- 
port of mysterious enemy machines, 
flights of ballistics attackers, heavy 
damage. The Over-mind rose to new 
heights of fury: 

“BRIGADES QLYX COGC, 
YLTK! CLOSE WITH THE EN- 
EMY AND DESTROY THEM! 
MAY RAINS OF ACID CON- 
SUME THE LAGGARD!” 

“He’s getting a little upset now,” 
I called to Joel. “He doesn’t know 
what’s happening. Be on the alert 
for those brigades — they’re out for 
blood.” . 

A flight of missiles appeared over 
the horizon, arcing down on us. I

integrated their courses, saw diat 
they would overshoot. 

“Hold your fire, Joel!” I called. 
“We’ll save our firepower for when 
it counts.^’ 

Volley followed volley, arcing 
high overhead — decoys intended to 
draw fire at maximum range rather 
than to inflict hits. I felt for the 
imbecile brain of the waveleader — 
a twitter of fear-patterns, food-lusts, 
mating drives, tropisms, subverted to 
the uses of evasion patterns and 
course corrections. With a touch, I 
readjusted their navigational orienta- 
tion, saw the flight swing and drive 
back to dive on its originators. 

Below, the enemy, confused by 
the abrupt desertion of the van- 
guard, milled in confusion. Those 
that advanced met a hail of destruc- 
tion from the guns of two hundred 
and ten units firing from cover. 
They hesitated, fell back. A final 
lone enemy-brained unit, scarred and 
burned, came relentlessly on, rocked 
to our bombardment, veered to one 
side and plunged over a precipice. 
I gave the cease-fire, and watched 
the aimless maneuvering of the 
moron units below — and still they 
came over the horizon, pouring in 
in Brigade strength, their sensors 
seeking out targets, finding none, T 
saw a damaged unit go berserk, 
charge down on a comrade, firing, 
and in automatic response, a thou- 
sand guns, glad of a target, vapor- 
ized it a corruscation of ravening en- 
ergies. 

4 4T ooks like we mixed ’em up 
A-' pretty good, Jones,” Joel 
commented. 



“We gained a little time,” 1 re- 
plied. “They’re not what you’d call 
flexible.” 

“Whafs our next move? We’re 
in a kind of a dead end here. Once 
they figure what’s going on they’ll 
surround the place and lob it in on 
us from all sides — and we’re gon- 
ers.” 

“Meanwhile, things are quiet. 
Now’s our chance to hold a council 
of war.” 

“Jones, 1 been looking over these 
units of ours — and there’s some- 
thing funny about ’em. It’s like they 
wasn’t really machines, kind of.” 

“They’re not. Every machine 
here has a human brain in it.” 

“Huh?” 

“Like you, Joel — and me. 
They’re all human. Just uncon- 
scious.” 

There was a pause while Joel 
probed the dulled mind of the near- 
est slave unit, waiting, guns aimed, 
for the order to carry on the fight. 

“Yeah, Jones. I see the place. 
It’s all blanked off, like. It’s like 
trying to poke a hole through a 
steel plate with your finger. But . .” 

“But what?” 

“Oh, I don’t know, Jones. I just 
got a feeling — if I touched it just 
right . Look, let me show you.” 

I extended awareness, touched 
the probe that was an extension of 
Joel’s mind-field, followed as it 
reached into the dim glow of the 
paralyzed mind, thrust among lay- 
ered patterns of pseudo-light, past 
complex structures that towered in- 
to unguessed levels of existence, deep 
into the convoluted intricacy of the 
living brain, to touch the buried per-

•onality center — encysted, inert, a 
pocket of nothingness deep under a 
barrier of stunned not-thought. 

‘‘Don’t you see, Jones? It ought 
to be, like, say a taut cable with 
toe wind making it sing. Something 
stopped it, clamped it down so’s 
it can’t move. we got to do to 
set it free is giv^ I a little push — 
and it’ll start up again.” 

“All I see is a dead spot, Joel. If 
you can see all that, you’re way 
ahead of me.” 

“Okay if I try it?” 

“Go ahead — and I’ll keep my 
relays crossed . .” 

“Here goes . 

I saw the finger of pure, focus- 
sed energy reach out, touch the 
grayness — and the opacity faded 
and was gone. 

“Okay so far,” Joel said. “Now 

Like a jeweler cleaving a hundred 
carat rough diamond, Joel poised, 
then struck once, sharply. 

And the glow that had been the 
moron mind of a slave sprang up 
in a dazzling light;, and into the gray 
continuum where thought moved like 
a living force, words came: 
“FAEDER URE, HVAD DEO- 
FELS GIRDA HA WAERLOGAS 
CRAEFT BRINGIT EORLA AV 
ONGOL-SAXNA CYNING TILL!” 

XXI 

T he huge fighting machine parked 
forty feet away across the 
rocky ledge behind me backed sud- 
denly, lowered its guns, traversed 
toem across the empty landscape, 
brought them to bear on me. 



“Watch him Jones!” Joel’s voice 
came sharply. “He’s scared; he’s li- 
able to get violent!” 

In the instant xnat the strange 
voice had burst from the slave unit, 
my probing contact had been thrust 
back by an expanding mind-field as 
powerful as Joel’s. 

“We’re friends!” I called quickly 
in the code in which commands were 
transmitted. “Fellow prisoners!” I 
thrust against the pressure of the 
newly awakened mind, found the 
automated combat-reflex circuitry, 
clamped down an inhibiting field — 
enough to impede a fire-order, at 
least for a moment. 

“VA’ EORT THE, FEOND?” 
the strange voice shouted, a deafen- 
ing bellow in my mind. 

I plucked the conditioned identi- 
ty-concept from the mind before me, 
called to it in the command code: 
“Unit twenty-nine of the Anyx 
Brigade! Listen!” 

“AHH! EO MINNE BONDE- 
IX>M MID WYRD!” 

It roared out its barbaric jargon, 
overtones of fright and horror ris- 
ing like blood-stained tides in the 
confused mind. I tried again: 

“I’m a friend — an enemy of 
the Command-voice. You’ve been a 
slave. I’m another slave — 4n re- 
volt against the masters!” 

There was a moment of silence; 
then: “A fellow slave? What trick- 
ery is this?” And this time it spoke 
— or bellowed — in the familiar 
command code. 

“It’s no trick,” I transmitted. 
“You were captured — but now 
you’re free.” 

“Free? Invisible one, I wear the

likeness of a monstrous troll-shape! 
Enchantments hold me yet in bond- 
age. Where is my blade, Hrothgar? 
Where are my peers and bondsmen? 
What fire-blasted heath is this be- 
fore me?” 

I talked to the frightened mind, 
soothing it, explaining as much as 
I could. At last it seemed to under- 
stand — at least enough that I 
could withdraw my grip on its fire- 
control circuitry. 

“Ah, I feel a part of the spell re- 
leased!” the freed mind exclaimed. 
“Now soon perhaps TU feel Hroth- 
gar’s pommel against my palm, and 
waken from this dream of Hell!” 

“I was holding you,” I said. “I 
was afraid you’d fire on me before I 
could explain.” 

“You laid hands on an earl of the 
realm!” He was roaring again. 

“Not hands; just a suggestion — 
to keep you from doing anything 
hasty.” 

“Hello, Aethelbert,” Joel put in. 
“Sure glad to have you with us — ” 

44 Toel,” I interrupted. “Try an- 

J other one; wake as many as 
you can — but hold onto their 
battle-reflexes until you get them 
calmed down.” Then, to our new 
comrade: “We’re surrounded. There 
are thousands of them down there 
— see for yourself.” 

“Yes — never have I seen such 
concentration of brigades. What 
action is this we fight.” He broke 
off suddenly. “A strange thing it 
is, unseen one, but now I sense in 
my memory a vast lore of great troll- 
wars, fought with fire and magic 
under a black sky with a swollen 



moon. And I seem to see myself 
among them — an ogre of the 
ogres!” 

A call came from Joel: “I got an- 
other one, Jones! I don’t know what 
he’s saying, but it’s not in command 
code. Sure sounds excited!” 

“Keep it up, Joel.’ While he 
worked, I talked to Aethelbert. He 
was quick to grasp the situation — 
once he understood that I was only 
another combat unit like himself. 
Then he was ready to launch a 
one-man attack. 

“Well I remember the shape of 
the sorcerer: like a slinking dog it 
came, when I beached my boat on 
the rocky shores of Oronsay under 
Sgarbh Breae. My carls fell like 
swooning maids without the strik- 
ing of a blow — and then the were- 
wolf was on me, and Hrothgar’s 
honed edge glanced from its hide as 
a willow wand from the back of a 
sullen house -wench. And now they 
have given me shape of a war-troll! 
Now will I take such revenge as 
will make Loki roar over his mead- 
horn!” 

“Jones!” Joel cut in. “Here’s an- 
other one! He’s talking American; 
all about Very lights and Huns . .” 

I gave the new man a capsule 
briefing, then went on to another 
— a calm, cool mind speaking 
strangely accented Arabic. He 
blamed all his troubles on an evil 
Djinn of the sorcerer Salomon, in 
league with the Infidels. I let him 
talk, getting it all straight in his 
mind — then cued him to bring 
his conditioned battle-experience in- 
to his conscious awareness. He 
switched to Command Code without 



112 



IF 




a break in the stream of his 
thoughts. 

“By the virtue of the One God, 
such a gathering of units was never 
seen! Praise Allah, that I should 
be granted such a wealth of enemies 
to kill before I die!” 

I managed to hold him from a 
headlong charge, then picked up a 
new voice, this one crying out in 
antique Spanish to his Compeador, 
Saint Diego, God, and the Bishop 
of Seville, interchangeably, I assur- 
ed him that all was well, and went 
on ^ to the next man — a former 
artilleryman whose last recollection 
was of a charge by French cavalry, 
the flash of a saber 4— then night, 
and lying alone among the dead, un- 
til the dogs came. 

“Jones, we’re doing real good; 
that’s six now. But down on the 
plain they’re starting to move 
around. The Over-mind is reorgan- 
izing, and they’ll be attacking right 
soon now. We’re gonna run out of 
time . 

“Suppose our new men each start 
in to release others? Can you brief 
them — show them how? They 
can work in pairs, with one freeing 
a man and the other holding him 
down until he understands what’s 
happening.” 

“Hey, that’s a good idea! It’s 
easy, once you know how. Let’s start 
with Aethelbert . 

T ime was a term without mean- 
ing. To speak a sentence in the 
measured phrases of a human lan- 
guage required as long, subjectively, 
as to deliver a lengthy harangue in 
the compact Command Code — and 



yet the latter seemed, while I spoke, 
to consume as much time as its 
more deliberate equivalent. My cir- 
cuitry, designed for instantaneous 
action, accommodated to the mode 
of speech — ^just as, on low alert, a 
waiting period that might measure 
weeks by terrestrial standards could 
pass in a brief hour of passive non- 
action. 

While Joel and I worked, calm- 
ing, reassuring, instructing, the 
seiging legions formed up into units 
on the dusty plain of white light 
moving. It might have been min- 
utes — or hours — before the last of 
our two hundred and ten combat 
units had been freed from the par- 
alyzing force of the Overmind. 

Three had raved, lapsed into in- 
and black shadow below, arraying 
themselves for the assault. In the 
sky, the Earth hung, apparently un- 
coherence — minds broken by the 
shock; two more had opened fire 
in the initial panic — and had been 
instantly blasted by the return fire 
of a dozen units — the first tra^c 
casualties of the campaign. Five 
more had resisted all efforts at con- 
tact; catatonics, permanently with- 
drawn from reality. And seven had 
gibbered in the alien symbolism of 
the demons — condemned criminals, 
sentenced to the Brigades for the 
crimes of inferiority, non-conformity 
or lilogic. These are snuffed out, 
left their mighty carapaces as mind- 
less slaves to be used as we had 
been used. It was ruthless — but 
this was a war of no quarter, species 
against species. 

And our legions grew in strength 
and readiness.

I called for their attention. “So far 
we’ve had the advantage of sur- 
prise,” 1 said. “We’ve hit and run, 
done the unexpected; they’ve milled 
around us like a herd of buffalo. 
We’ve managed to slice through 
them, pick off a few isolated units, 
capture a few more. But the honey- 
moon is about over. They’re stand- 
ing off out of take-over range, and 
they’ve imposed communications si- 
lence, so we don’t know what they’re 
planning.” 

‘'Like I thought: we’re losin’,” 
someone commented. 

“Will we huddle here to be burn- 
ed in our hall like Eric’s men?” 
Aethelbert boomed. “Is this the tenth 
deed I’ll relate to Thor in his mead- 
hall in Asqard?” 

“We got to bust out of here,” a 
Sixth Armored man said. “And fast, 
what I mean.” 

“We can keep hitting and run- 
ning — and lose a few men each 
time,” I went on. “In the end we’ll 
be wiped out.” 

“In the name of the one God, 
let us carry the fight to the legions 
of Shaitan!” 

“For the honor of the gods, I 
say attack!” 

“We’ll attack — but it will be a 
feint; Thomas, you’ll take twenty- 
seven units, and move out to the 
south. Don’t close; cruise their line 
at extreme range, as though you 
were looking for a weak spot. Put 
two of your best probemen on scan 
for recruits; you may be able to 
pick off a unit here and there. Keep 
up defensive fire only; if you draw 



out a pursuit column, tall back on 
this position, and try to capture 
them.” 

“Twenty-seven units say ye, sir? 
What of the others?” 

“I’m taking two men. When you 
reach a point close to a two-seven- 
oh heading from here — turn and 
hit their line with everything you’ve 
got. That will be my signal to move 
out.” 

“Wi’ two men only? By’r lakin, 
they’ll trounce ye like a stockfish!” 

“We’ll come out with screens 
down, ports closed, and mingle with 
the enemy. In the confusion. I’m 
counting on their assuming we’re 
loyal slaves. As soon as you see we’re 
in their lines, turn and run for it; 
keep them busy. With luck, we’ll get 
through — ” 

“And where would you be goin’?” 
an Irish voice demanded. 

“Their headquarters is about 
twelve miles west of here. I’m going 
to try to reach it.” 

W ith my two companions beside 
me, I waited at the south end 
of the ravine, watching the distant 
dust cloud that was Thomas’s force 
as it raced across the star-lit desert, 
the flickering of enemy guns light- 
ing the scene with a winking radi- 
ance of blue and red and white. Then 
I swung to enter the pass, gunned 
up the long slope. Ben followed, 
trailing by a quarter mile. Far back, 
Aethelbert was coming up fast, the 
fire of the remaining enemy unit 
lighting his defensive screens. 

I reached the crest of the pass, 
came to a halt looking down on a 
vast complex of works — tunnel

heads, squat sheds, low circular 
structures of unknown function — 
gray, rough textured, stark and 
ugly against the bleakness of the 
lunar landscape. And beyond the 
warren of buildings, a tower 
reached up into the glittering black 
of the night sky, a ragged shape 
like a lone spire remaining from a 
fallen ring wall: The Place that 

Must Be Defended. 

I looked back down the trail. 
From my vantage point I could see 
the broad sweep of the plain: the 
distant jumble of rock where we had 
regrouped, the milling mass of the 
enemy, strung out in a long pincers 
which enveloped the tiny group of 
winking lights that I knew was 
Thomas and his dwindling band; and 
nearer, the dust trail reaching almost 
to the foot of the pass, and the sec- 
ond trail, close behind. 

From halfway down the sloping 
trail, a once-Confederate named 
Ben called: “Aethelbert’s in trouble; 
he’s taken a hit, I think — and some- 
body’s closing on him. I better give 
him a leg up.” 

‘^Aethelbertl” I called. ‘‘Are you 
all right?” 

T 'here was no answer. I saw him 
slow as he entered the pass, turn 
sideways, blocking the entry, his 
guns pointed back toward the ene- 
my. The oncoming unit poured fire 
into the now stationary target; it 
rocked to hit after hit. Ben, coming 
up beside me now, swung his guns, 
opened fire on the enemy unit as it 
came within range. 

“Aethelbert, we’ll cover you!” I 
called. “Come on into the pass.” 



“I’ll tarry here, Jones,” came a 
faint reply. “There’ll be no lack of 
foes to tempt my thunder.” 

“Just a few yards farther!” 

“Bare is the back without brother 
behind it,” he sang out. “Now take 
the meadhall of the goblins by 
storm, and may Odin guide your 
sword-arm!” 

“I’m goin’ back for him!” Ben 
yelled. 

“As you were, Ben! The target’s 
ahead! Let’s go and get it!” I launch- 
ed myself down the slope without 
waiting to see him comply; a mo- 
ment later, he passed me, racing to 
run interception for me. 

“Head for the tower,” I called. 
The first buildings were close now 
— unlovely constructions of fea- 
tureless stone, puny in scale. 

I saw a tiny dark shape appear 
in a tunnel mouth, bound toward a 
cluster of huts — and recognized it 
as one of the dog-things, looking no 
larger to me than a leaping rat. Its 
head was grotesquely muffled in a 
breathing mask — apparently its 
only protection from the lunar vacu- 
um. I veered, bore down on it, saw 
its skull-face twist toward me as 
my treads caught it, pulped it in 
an instant, flung the bristled rag 
that was its corpse far behind me. 

Ahead, Ben braked to a halt be- 
fore a wide gate, swung his forward 
battery on it, blasted it to rubble, 
then roared ahead through the gap, 
with me close behind — 

A shock wave struck me like a 
solid wall of steel. 

I felt myself go up, leap back, 
crash to the rocky ground, slide to 
rest in a shower of debris. Half

dazed, I stared through the settling 
dust, saw the blackened hulk that 
had been my Confederate scout, 
smoke boiling from every aperture, 
his treads gone, gun barrels melted. 
I shouted his name, caught a faint 
reply: 

“Cap’n . don’t move . trap 
... all automatic stuff ... I saw 
’em too late . Hellbores ... set 
in the walls . You’ll trigger ’em 
when you move . don’t stir . .” 
I felt his mind-field fade, wink out. 

I scanned the interior of the com- 
pound, saw the black mouths of the 
mighty guns, aimed full on me . 
waiting. 

1 reached out, felt for the dim 
glow of cybernetic controls, found 
nothing. They were mechanically 
operated, set to blast anything that 
moved in the target area. The det- 
onation that had halted me in my 
tracks had saved my life. 

Ben was dead. Behind me, Aethel- 
bert held the pass alone; and on the 
plain, my comrades fought on, in 
ever-dwindling numbers, covering 
my desperation bid for victory. 

And I was here, caught like a fly 
in a web, helpless, fifty yards from 
my objective. 

XXIII 

T he explosion had blackened the 
pavement of the court, gouged 
a crater a yard deep, charred the 
blank invulnerable wdls that ringed 
it. My hull, too, would be blackened 
and pitted. 

I could see fragments of my 
blasted comrade scattered all across 
the yard; splashes of molten metal 



were bright against the drab ma- 
sonry. 

There were openings in the walls, 
I noted as the last of the dust fell 
back, the final shreds of black smoke 
dissipated in the near-vacuum. They 
seemed no bigger than rat-holes, but 
I realized that they were actually 
about a yard wide and half again 
as high. As I watched, a pale snout 
poked from one; then the lean with- 
ers and flanks of a demon appeared, 
its size diminished by contrast with 
my immense body. The thing wore a 
respirator helmet like the one I had 
seen earlier; straps criss-crossed its 
back. It bounded lightly to the burn- 
ed-out hulk that had been Ben, 
circled it, stepping daintily around 
chunks that still glowed red. It came 
to me then, disappeared as it passed 
under the range of my visual units. 

I held myself totally unmoving, 
carefully withdrew vitality from my 
external circuitry, closed myself be- 
hind an inner shield of not-thought. 
Alone in the absolute darkness of 
sensory deprivation, I waited for 
what might happen next. 

Faintly, I felt a probing touch — 
ghostly fingers of alien thought that 
groped along my dark circuitry, seek- 
ing for indications of activity. There 
was an abortive shudder as an im- 
pulse was directed at my drive con- 
trols. Then the questing probe with- 
drew. 

Cautiously, I extended sensitivity 
to my visual complex, saw the crea- 
ture as it trotted back to its hole. 
Again the compound was silent and 
empty — except for the corpse of 
the great machine that had been my 
friend.

THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



Quickly, I ran an inspection, dis- 
covered the worst: My drive mech- 
anism was fused at vital points in 
the front suspension, and my for- 
ward batteries were inoperative — 
warped by the terrific heat of the 
blast from the hellbores that had 
smashed Ben. I was trapped inside 
ten thousand terrestrial tons of in- 
ert, dead metal. 

M ore demons emerged from the 
building now, trotting from the 
same arched way through which the 
first had come. Other creatures fol- 
lowed — squat, many-armed things 
like land- walking octopi. They went 
to Ben, swarmed over the hot metal, 
perched high up on the blackened 
carapace, set to work. 

Below on the dusty ground, the 
demons paced, or stood in pairs, si- 
lently watching. 

I considered reaching out to 
touch a demon mind — and rejected 
the idea. I was not skilled enough 
to be sure of not alerting it, warning 
it that something still lived inside my 
scorched and battered hull. 

Instead, I selected a small horror 
squatting on the fused mass that 
had been Ben’s forward turret. I 
reached out, found the awareness- 
center . • . 

Grays and blacks and whites, 
dimly-seen — but with distorted 
pseudo-scent images sharp-etched; 
furtive thoughts of food, and 
warmth, and rest, a wanderlust and 
a burning drive for a formless con- 
cept that was a female . 

It was the brain of a cat, installed 
in the maintenance machine, its na- 
tural drives perverted to the uses of 



the aliens, its keen sense linked to 
electronic sensers, its superb motor- 
ennervation linked to demon-made 
limbs of insensitive metal. I explored 
the tiny brain, saw the wonderful 
complexity of even this simple mech- 
anism — vastly more sophisticated 
than even the most complex of cy- 
bernetic circuits. 

With an effort, I extended the 
scope of my contact, saw mistily 
what its eyes saw: the pitted sur- 
face of metal on which it squatted, 
the tiny cutting tools with which it 
drilled deep into the burned chromal- 
ly of the ruined hull. I sensed the 
heat of the metal, the curve of it 
under me, the monomaniacal drive 
to do thus — and thus — boring 
the holes, setting the charge, moving 
on to the next . 

I pulled back, momentarily con- 
fused by the immediacy of the ex- 
perience. The small machines, under 
the direction of the demons, were 
preparing to blast open the fused 
access hatch. 

Abruptly, I became aware of a 
sensation in my outer hull, checked 
the appropriate sensors, felt the pres- 
sure of small bodies, the hot probe 
of needle-tipped drills. 

In my preoccupation, I had failed 
to notice that a crew was at work 
on me, too. Soon — in minutes, or 
an hour or two — a shock would 
drive through me, as my upper ac- 
cess hatch was blasted away, ex- 
posing my living brain to the vac- 
uum and the cold metal probes of 
the machines. 

Delicately, I directed movement to 
the cat’s ’limbs. They moved 
smoothly in response, walked me

IF 




across the twisted metal. 

I turned the sensory cluster to 
stare across at the openings in the 
wall, gaping now like great arched 
entries to the small-scale sensors of 
the tiny apparatus. Half a dozen 
now-huge demons paced or stood 
between me and the doors. None 
seemed to have noticed that I was 
no longer at work. I moved on down 
the side of the wrecked machine, 
sprang to the dust-drifted ground. 

A demon turned empty red eyes 
on me, looked past me, turned away. 
I moved toward the nearest arch- 
way, scuttling along at a speed which 
I hoped was appropriate to a main- 
tenance unit returning to its stor- 
age bay for repairs or supplies. 

Another demon swung its head to 
watch, followed me with its eyes as 
I crossed the open ground. I reach- 
ed the arch, hopped up the low step, 
sjipped into the darkness of the 
high-arched passage. 

Somewhere in the ominous tower 
before me — the Place That Must 
Be Defended — lay the secret of 
the power of the demons. My only 
chance of survival lay in finding it. 

I tore my eyes from the light and 
started into the dark maze. 

T he passage was featureless, un- 
adorned, running straight to a 
heavy lock which opened at the 
pulse my well -drilled cat-brain 
emitted. 

In my octopoid body I scuttled 
forward into a tiny chamber, waited 
while the inner seal slid aside. A 
wider corridor lay before me, bright- 
ly illuminated in the infra-red range 
—and crowded with hurrying de- 



mons, looking as immense as gaunt 
and bristled horses to my small-scale 
sensors. I moved ahead, ignored by 
the busy inmates of the building. 

I found a rising ramp, hurried up 
its wide curve, emerged on another 
level, like the first except that there 
were other creatures here — tall, 
mechanical-looking things that am- 
bled on irridescent chitinous limbs. 
I saw one or two demons of another 
species, characterized by flatter faces 
and enormous, protruding teeth, and 
pale, tawny hides. They wore 
more elaborate harness than the 
worker- cl ass things I had met in the 
past, and there was a glint of jew- 
eled decoration on their brightwork 
fittings — ^the first signs of frivolity 
I had seen among the aliens. 

I saw two of the humanoid aliens 
of the General Julius type. Both wore 
familiar earthly costumes — one a 
pink business suit and other a stain- 
ed military uniform; I judged 
that they were agents reporting on 
their operations among the natives. 
None of these varied, life-forms paid 
the slightest attention to me, but I 
couldn’t help feeling as vulnerable 
as a newborn mouse in a rattler’s 
cage. The most superficial probe 
from any of them would shatter my 
tenuous grip on the slave-machine’s 
ego center. 

And an instant later, my own un- 
tenanted brain would be shattered — 
or enslaved again. 

Moving past a congregation of 
the insect-things before a wide, 
square-cut door, I spied a narrow 
stair leading up from a short pas- 
sage to the right. I turned in, went 
along to it, looked up its dark well. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

What I was looking for, I didn’t 
know — but instinct seemed to urge 
me upward. 

1 hopped up with my ten legs, 
began the climb. 

XXIV 

I was in a wide chamber with a 
high ceiling supported by col- 
umns, among which massive ap- 
paratus was ranked in endless rows. 

Great red-eyed demons prowled 
the aisles of the sides of stilt-legged 
insect- things — whether as gu^ds 
or servants, I couldn’t tell. A ca- 
cophony of humming, buzzing, rau- 
cous squealing, deep-toned roaring, 
filled the thin air, as the batteries 
of giant machines churned out their 
unimaginable products. I scurried, 
along, darting around the careless 
footfalls of the giant creatures, made 
for a door across the room, on eith- 
er side of which two immense de- 
mons squatted on their haunches 
like vast watchdogs. I thought of the 
soldier in the fairy-tale, who had 
stolen the treasure guarded by a 
dog with eyes as big as saucers. 
These eyes were smaller, and of a 
balefid red, but they were as watch- 
ful as look-outs for a burglar gang. 
They were guarding something. That 
was reason enough for me to want 
to pass the door. 

I scurried past them, saw other 
small machines like myself hurry- 
ing about their tasks, numbly skip- 
ping aside when threatened by a 
heavy foot. I had chosen my dis- 
guise well. The tiny cat-brained de- 
vices appeared to have free run of 
the tower. 



There was a quiet comer where 
a cross-aisle dead-ended. 1 settled 
myself in it, blanked off sensory in- 
put, reached out to the most super- 
ficial level of mental activity, sensed 
the darting action/reaction impulses 
of the other cat-brains all around 
me. I selected one dim center, felt 
gingerly through its simple drives, 
selected one, stimulated it, planted 
a concept. Quickly I jumped to a 
second brain, keyed its elemental 
impulses, then went on to a fourth, 
and a fifth . 

I withdrew and focused my sen- 
sors. Across the floor, I saw a small 
machine darting erratically about, 
attracting cold stares from the busy 
creatures ^around it. A second ma- 
chine scuttled into view from be- 
tween giant apparati, paused a mo- 
ment, jittering on thin legs, then 
darted to the first, leaped at it. 

With a metallic clatter, the two 
rolled across the floor and struck 
the lean shank of a demon which 
bounded aside, whirled, struck out. 
A third cat-brained machine dashed 
to join the fray. Two more appeared 
at the same moment, saw each oth- 
er, came together with a crash — 
five enraged Toms, each sure he 
was attacking a rival for the imagin- 
ed female the image of whose 
presence I had evoked. 

A dirty trick, but effective. 

The two guardian demons bound- 
ed from their posts, sprang at the 
combatants, cuffed them apart — 
but only for an instant. Nimbly, the 
fighting cats danced aside from the 
rush of the dog-things, darted back 
to re-engage. I moved from my 
corner, scurried along the baseboard

to the guarded door, fired a trig- 
gering pulse at its mechanism. It 
stood firm. 

I extended a sensing probe — a 
form of supersonic sonar, I real- 
ized as I felt over the shapes of 
the locking circuitry. I perceived 
the required form for the unlock- 
ing signal, transmitted it. The mo- 
ronic apparatus responded, withdrew 
the magnetic locking field, I nudged 
the door, felt it swinc^ open, slipped 
past it, pushed it shut behind me. 

A narrow stair well lead up toward 
light. 

1 started up, feeling my thin 
limbs tiring now. My power-pack 
needed recharging; I felt a power- 
ful reflexive urge to descend to a 
dimly conceived place where a 
niche waited, in which I could 
snuggle against comforting contacts 
and receive a pleasure-flow of re- 
newed vitality . 

I overrode the conditioned urge 
and clambered up the high-looming 
steps. They were scaled to the long 
legs of the demons, almost too high 
for my limited agility. There was no 
alarm from below. The demon- 
guardians had failed to notice the 
penetration of their sanctum sanc- 
torum. 

I was dragging myself as I top- 
ped the last step. I squatted with 
trembling limbs outsprawled, look- 
ing into a bright, round room, walled 
with smooth, nacreous material that 
resembled mother of pearl pierced 
with glazed openings beyond which 
the black lunar sky pressed close. 
At the center of the chamber, a 
shallow bowl rested on a short col- 



umn, like a truncated bird-bath of 
polished metal. 

After a moment’s rest, I moved 
into the room. I was aware of a 
curious humming, a sense of vast 
power idling at the edge of percep- 
tibility. The floor was smooth un- 
der me, extending to a curving joint 
with the walls, which rose, darken- 
ing, to form a shadowed dome 
many yards overhead. The light was 
diffuse, soft, sourceless. 

I circled the gleaming pedestal, 
searching for some indication of the 
meaning or utility of this strange 
place, so unlike the stark and func- 
tional ugliness of the levels below. 
There was nothing. No indication 
of life, no sign of controls or in- 
strumentation. 

Perhaps, after all, the Place That 
Must Be Defended was no more 
than a ceremonial temple dedicated 
to whatever strange deities might 
command the devotion of the mon- 
sters that prowled the levels be- 
^ow . 

There was a sound — a dry 
clicking, like a dead twig tapping a 
window. I crouched near the pedes- 
tal, stared around me, saw nothing. 
The walls of the empty room gleam- 
ed softly, sil^^ntly. 

The sound came again — and a 
dry squeaking, as of leather sliding 
against unoiled metal. A diffuse sha- 
dow, faint, formless, glided down 
the walls. I turned my sensors up 
ward — and saw it. 

"|"t hung in the gloom of the dome, 
a bulging, grayish body in a 
cluster of tentacular members like 
giant angleworms, clinging to a 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



121 




bright filament depending from the 
peak of the onion-shaped dome. 

As I watched, it dropped down 
another foot, its glistening reticulat- 
ed arms moving with a hideous, 
fluid grace. A cluster of stemmed 
sense organs poked from the upper 
side of the body — crab-eyes on a 
torso like a bag of oil. I recognized 
the shape of the creature. It was 
the one on which my borrowed me- 
chanical form was modelled. 

The thing saw me then — I was 
sure of it. It paused in its descent, 
tilted its eyes toward me. I didn’t 
move. Then the worm-arms twitch- 
ed, flowed. It dropped lower, un- 
reeling the cable as it came. It 
was five yards above the parabolic 
bowl, then four, then three. There 
was a feeling of haste in its move- 
ments now, something frantic in its 
scrambling descent. 

Whatever the thing was. its objec- 
tive was clear: to reach the polished 
bowl below it — quickly. My move 
was obvious: to prevent it. 

I sprang to the pedestal, reared 
up, my forelimbs catching at the 
edge of the bowl. I scrabbled with 
other legs at the smooth base, found 
purchase for another pair of limbs. 
I was clear of the floor now, rising 
up to the edge — 

The thing above me emitted a 
mewing cry, dropped abruptly an- 
other yard, then released its sup- 
port and launched itself at me. The 
flailing tentacles caught at me, wrap- 
ped me in an embrace like a nest of 
constrictors. I lost my hold, fell 
back with a stunning crash, the alien 
thing still entoiling me. 

It broke away, reached for the 



bowl, swung itself up; I sprang after 
it, seized a trailing limb with three 
of mine, hauled back. It turned like 
a striking snake, struck out at me 
— blows that sent me over on my 
back, skidding away, until I was 
brought up short by the grip I had 
retained on one outflung member. 
I righted myself with a bound, 
crouched under a new rain of 
blows, lashed out in return, saw 
thick mustard-colored fluid ooze 
from a wound on the heavy body. 

The thing went mad. 

It lashed its many legs in wild, 
unaimed blows, leaping against the 
restraint of my grip. I caught an- 
other flailing arm, the cruel metal 
of my pincers biting into the yielding 
muscle. 

Abruptly it changed its tactics. 
Its multiple arms reached out to me, 
seized me, hauled me close. Then, 
with a surge, it raised me, dashed 
me down against the rock-hard 
floor. Dazed, I felt my grip go 
slack, the sinuous members of the 
alien withdraw. I reached after it 
felt a last member slither from my 
weakened grasp. 

I could see again. The thing was 
at the pedestal, swarming up, teeter- 
ing on the edge of the bowl. 

I gathered my strength, lunged af- 
ter it, drove my outstretched arm 
up at the unprotected underbody, 
felt it strike, pierce deep . 

The thing wailed, a horrifying 
cry. For a moment it wrapped its 
futile arms around my stabbing 
metal one; then it went limp, fell 
back, struck and lay, a slack heap 
of flabby, colorless flesh, in a spat- 
ter of viscious ochre. 



122 



IF 




I rested for a moment, feeling the 
on-off-on flashes of failing 
senses. I had spent the last of my 
waning energy in the battle with the 
deciped. It was hard to hold my 
grip on the fading consciousness of 
the cat-brain; almost, I could feel 
my awareness slipping away, back 
to the doomed hulk in the court- 
yard below, the guns still erained 
upon my inert body. 

I wondered how close the drillers 
were now to the vulnerable brain 
— and how Aethelbert fared at the 
pass, how many of my comrades 
still lived on the shattered battle- 
fi'.'ld beyond. 

There was one more effort re- 
quired of me before I relapsed back 
into the darkness that seemed to 
beckon all around. The thing I had 
killed had attacked me to keep me 
from reaching the hollow of the 
metal bowl-shape, and had striven 
frantically to attain it itself. I had 
to discover what it had guarded 
there. 

I dragged myself to the base of 
the pedestal, rose up, tottering, 
groped for the edge above. 

It was too far. I sank back quiv- 
ering, black lights dancing in my 
dimming sensory field. Beside me 
lay the dead alien. I groped to it, 
crawled up on the slumped curve 
of its flaccid body, tried again. Now 
my fore-limbs reached the edge of 
the bowl, gripped; I pushed myself 
up, brought other limbs into play. 
Now I swung, suspended. With a 
supreme effort, I hauled myself up, 
^oped, found a hold across the 
bowl — and tipped myself into the 
polished hollow. 



F rom a source as bottomless as 
space itself, power flowed, 
sweeping through me with an ectasy 
that transcended all pleasure, 
burning away the dead husks of 
fatigue, hopelessness, pain. 

I felt my mind come alive, as a 
thousand new senses illuuminated 
the plane of space-time in which 
I hung; I sensed the subtle organi- 
zational patterns of the molecular 
aggregations that swirled over me, 
the play of oscillations all across the 
spectrum of electromagnetic radi- 
ation, the infinity of intermeshing 
pressures, flows, transitions that 
were reality. The scope of my aware- 
ness spread out to sense the struc- 
tured honeycomb of the tower walls, 
the scurrying centers of energy that 
were living minds nested in flesh 
and metal, drove outward to em- 
brace the surrounding court, noting 
the bulk of cold metal that was the 
ruined machine in which my un- 
conscious brain lay buried — and 
outward still, sweeping across the 
curve of the world, detecting the pat- 
terned network of glowing points 
scattered across the waste of life- 
lessness. 

Now each dim radiance took on 
form and dimension, swelling until 
separately, yet together, their in- 
ner structures lay exposed. I saw 
the familar forms of human minds, 
each locked in a colorless prison of 
paralysis — and the alien shapes of 
demon-minds, webs of weird thought- 
forms born of an unknowable con- 
ception of reality. And here and 
there, in clusters, were other minds, 
beacons of flashing vitality — the 
remnant of my fighting brigades? 



THE HOONOS OF HEll 



123 




I singled out one, called to it: 

‘‘JOEL! HOW DOES THE 
FIGHT GO?” 

His answer was a flare of con- 
fusion, question; then: 

They' re poundin' us, Jones. 
Where are you? Can you send us 
any help?" 

“HOLD ON, JOEL! I’M IN 
THEIR HEADQUARTERS. I’LL 
DO WHAT I CAN!” 

“Tom gave me a turn, Jones. For 
a minute I thought you was the 
Over-mind, you came through so 
strong" His voice was weak, fading. 
“7 guess ifll all be over pretty soon, 
Jones. I'm glad we tried, though. 
Sorry it turned out like this . 

“DON’T GIVE UP — NOT 
YET!” I broke off, scanned again 
Ithe array of enslaved human minds. 
I thought back to the frantic hour I 
had spent when Joel and I had 
freed the trapped minds of Aethel- 
bert and Doubtsby and Bermuez. 

If I could reach them all now, 
in one great sweep , . 

I brought the multitude of dully 
glowing centers into sharp focus, 
fixed in my mind the concept of 
the pattern of their natural reason- 
ance — and sent out a pulse. 

All across the dark face of the 
dead world faint points of illumina- 
tion quickened, flared up, blazed 
bright. At once, I fired an orienta- 
tion-concept — a single complex 
symbol which placed in each dazed 
and newly emancipated brain the 
awareness of the status quo, the 
need for instant attack on demon- 
brained enemies. 

I switched my plane of reference 
back to Joel. 



“HOLD YOUR FIRE!” I called. 
“BE ON THE ALERT FOR NEW 
RECRUITS COMING OVER, BY 
THE FULL BRIGADE!” 

I caught Joel’s excited answer, 
then switched to alert the others. The 
pattern of the great battle changed. 
Now isolated demon-brained ma- 
chines fought furiously against 
overwhelming odds, winked out one 
by one. Far away, in distant depots, 
on earth-lit deserts a thousand miles 
from the tower of the Over-mind, 
awakened slave brigades blasted as- 
tronished centurions, sallied forth 
to seek out and destroy the hated 
former masters. From a dozen hid- 
den fortresses, beleagered demons 
fitted out vast siege units, sent them 
forth to mow broad swatches through 
the attacking battle units before 
they fell to massive bombardments. 
In a lull, I searched through the 
building below me, found and pinch- 
ed out the frantic demons hiding 
there. 

Their numbers dwindles, shrank 
from thousands to a dozen, six, two, 
a single last survivor — then none. 

The moon was ours. 

XXV 

J oel’s great bulk, pitted with new 
scars bright against the old, 
loomed up beside me in the com- 
pound, bright under the glow of a 
full Earth. 

“All the fellows are here now, 
Jones — we lost seventy-one, the 
major says. A couple dozen more 
are disabled, like you and Aethel- 
bert, but still live. The maintenance 
machines have gone to work on

’em. We got plenty of spares, any- 
way. We’ll have you rolling again 
in no time.” 

“Good work, Joel.” I widened my 
contact to take in all of the hundred 
and eight intact survivors of the 
original group of freed slaves. 

Every one of you will have his 
hands full, rounding up the new men 
and organizing them. We have no 
way of knowing how soon our late 
enemies’ home base will start in- 
quiring after them. And when they 
do, we want to be ready.” 

“What about going home, chief?” 
a man who had taken a bullet in 
the knee at the Hurtgen Forest call- 
ed out. “How we going to get back?” 
“You off your onion, mate?” a 
one-time British sailor growled. 
“What kind o’ show you think we’d 
make waltzing into Picadilly in these 
get-ups!” 

“We got to go back, to kill off the 
rest of these devils, haven’t we?” 
“Mum, my masters,” Thomas in- 
terrupted. “Hear out our captain.” 
“Two days ago I used the en- 
emy’s equipment to call Earth,” I 
told them. “I managed a link-up to 
the public visiscreen system, and got 
through to the Central Coordinating 
Monitor of an organization called 
the Ultimax Group. I gave them 
the full picture. They knew what to 
do. The enemy is outnumbered a 
million to one down there; a few 
thousand troops wearing special 
protective helmets and armed with 
recoilless rifles can handle them.” 
“Yeah, but what about us?” the 
soldier burst out. “What are we go- 
ing to do — — stay* on this God- 
forsaken place forever? Hell, there’s 



transports at the depots; let’s use 
’emi I got a wife and kids back 
there!” 

“Are you daft, fellow?” a dra- 
goon of Charles the Second inquir- 
ed. “Your chicks are long since 
dust, and their dam with them — as 
are mine, God pity ’em.” 

“My old woman’s alive and curs- 
ing yet, no doubt,” a Dutch UN 
platoon leader said. “But she 
wouldn’t know me now — aijd keep- 
ing me in reaction mass’d play hell 
with her household budget. No, 1 
can’t see going back . .” 

“Maybe — they could get us 
human bodies again, some way . 

“Human body, indeed!” the dra- 
goon cut him off. “Could a fighting 
man hope for a better corpse than 
this, that knows naught of tooth- 
ache, the ague nor the French dis- 
ease?” 

Another voice cut into the talk 
— the voice of Ramon Descortes 
of the Ultimax Group, listening in 
from Earth on the . circuit I held 
open. 

“General Bravais,” he said ex- 
citedly — and I channeled his trans- 
mission through my circuitry, 
broadcasting it to every man within 
range. “I’ve been following your 
talk. Although I find it unbeliev- 
able, I’m faced with the incontro- 
vertible evidence. Our instruments 
indicate that your transmissions are 
undoubtedily coming from Luna — 
how and why you will explain in 
due course, I hope. You’ve told me 
that you — and the others — have 
been surgically transplanted to ar- 
tificial environments. Now you wish 
to be restored. Naturally! Let me

urge you to return — and wc will 
have for each of you a new body 
of superb design — not stricdy hu- 
to say the leastP 

I had to call for order to quell the 
uproar. 

“Some kind of android?” I asked. 
“We have on hand a captive — 
an alien operative of the humanoid 
type. We will capture more — alive. 
They will be anestheized and placed 
in deep freeze, awaiting your return. 
According to the present estimate, 
there are some ten thousand of 
them working here on Earth. Suf- 
ficient for your needs, I believe ” 
“Say, how’s the fight going there?” 
someone called. 

“Well. The first Special Units 
have gone into action at Chicago, 
Paris and Tamboula, with com- 
plete success. Governments are 
falling like autumn leaves, well- 
known figures are suiciding in 
droves, and mad dogs are reported 
everywhere. It is only a matter of 
hours now.” 

“Then there’s nothing to stand in 
the way!” 

“Broadway, here I come!” 

“Paris — without a king? Why 
» 

“An end to war? As well and end 
to living!” 

“What about you, General?” 
someone call^, and others joined 
in. 

“I’ll order the transports made 
ready immediately,” I said. “Every 
man that wants to go back can 
leave in a matter of hours.” 

“Jones — I mean. General — ” 
loel started. 



“Jones will . do; I won’t need the 
old name any more.” 

“You’re not going back?” 

“We fought a battle here,” I 
said. “And we won. But the war goes 
on. On a hundred worlds; a thou- 
sand — we don’t know how many. 
The demons rule space — but Man 
is on his way now. He’ll be jump- 
ing off Earth, reaching out to those 
worlds. And when he reaches them 
— she’ll find the armored brigades 
of the enemy waiting for him. Noth- 
ing can stand against them — ex- 
cept us. We’ve proven that we can 
outfight twice our number in slave 
machines. And we can free the minds 
that control those machines, turn 
them against the enemy. The farther 
we go, the bigger our force will be. 
Some day, in the far future, we’ll 
push them off the edge of the Ga- 
laxy. Until then, the war goes on. I 
can’t go home again — but I can 
fight for home, wherever I find the 
enemy.” 

“General Bravais,” a new voice 
cut in. “Surely you can’t mean that? 
Why, your name will be on every 
tongue on Earth! You’re the hero 
of the century. Of any century! 
You’ll be awarded every decora- 
tion—” 

“A battle-scarred five-thousand- 
ton Battle Unit would be ill at ease 
in a procession down Pennsylvania 
Avenue,” I said. “For better or 
worse, my chromalloy body and I 
are joined irretrievably. I couldn’t 
sit on a veranda and sip a whiskey 
sour, knowing what was waiting — 
out there. So I’m going to meet it, 
instead. How 'many are going with 
me?” 



126 



IF 




And the answer was a mighty 
roar in many tongues, from many 
ages — the voice of Man, that 
would soon be heard among the 
stars. 

XXVI 

T he star-ship Destoire descended 
on a pale column of blue light, 
came to rest on the edge of a shal- 
low sea edged with flower-like trees 
set in a carpet of russet grass. Her 
captan and crew emerged, walked 
to the top of a low hill, surveyed 
the countryside. 

“Beautiful,” the navigator said. 
"And like all the others — deserted,” 
“You romanticize,” the second of- 
ficer scoffed. “Uninhabited, perhaps. 
But the term ‘deserted’ implies 
former habitation; this world is vir- 
gin. 

The captain nudged him. “Then 
what’s that?” he pointed. A grassy 
promontory thrust up from the level 
plain a mile distant; beyond it, a 
second mound rose, lonely in the 
sweep of prairie. 

“An outcropping of rock, I sup- 
pose . .” 

The captain exchanged a look 
with the navigator. “Even though 
this is your first trip out of the 
Home System surely you’ve heard 
Ae stories of the Pathfinders — ” 
“Folklore,” the second officer 
said. “A pretty fairytale.” 

“But the proofs — ” 

“Can be manufactured by anyone 
who has a taste for the fanciful. 
Come now, we’re grown men. We 
needn’t give lip service to legends 
of evil demons and beneficient 



trolls who fight them in our be- 
half!” 

“Come along,” the captain said. 
He started down the long slope 
toward the distant hillock. 

I t loomed up sixty feet above the 
level plain, a craggy shape of 
torn and pitted metal, its wounds 
half concealed under a shroud of 
vines. Wind-blown soil had lodged 
in crannies and seeds had sprouted 
there, and now the wind stirred the 
grass-blades and the stemmed wild- 
flowers that softened the harsh angles 
of the ancient machine. Corroded 
stumps that had once been gun bar- 
rels thrust out from among whisper- 
ing leaves, a hint of defiance still 
implicit in their carriage. 

The navigator pulled away a 
cable of vine, exposed a patch of 
still-bright surface. 

“That was a brigade insignia,” 
he said. “I’ve seen pictures. .” 
“Look here,” the captain said. He 
had cleared the covering of leaves 
from a plate of polished chromalloy, 
with deeply-incised lettering clear- 
ly visible against the imperishable 
metal. 

He leaned close, pursing his lips 
over the inscription. Then he read 
aloud:

Dear Editor: 

Three cheers for Jim Maugham! 
Three kicks to J.R. Parkes. Alright. 
Here’s a hot discussion, a sweeping 
concept, and a unique philosophy. 

It’s stretching the point a little 
!o call this a philosophy but it fills 
bill on the other two counts. We 
no .v have two so-called sf television 
programs on the national networks. 
I he plots are of a kindergarten 
t>[)e, technical matters are some- 
times faked out, and good old fash- 
ioned space opera is not the primary 
fare. 

Outer Limits has done a better job 
than Twilight Zone, Their alien get- 
ups are marvelous and some of the 
stories are masterpieces, even if the 
plots are ultra-simple. The main fault 
of these shows is that they’re sf 
watered down for the people who 
don’t like sf. 

In fact, the trials that producers, 
writers and directors go through to 
please the twelve year old national 
intelligence borders on the ridicu- 
lous, as they cut and hack and slash 



almost all the scripts that come 
to them. If these programs were 
upgraded to the point where they 
would be a little more pleasing to 
people who enjoy sf it would not 
only heighten the national opinion 
of sf as a literary form but it would 
bring more to our ranks. There are 
many people around who think of 
Flash Gordon when sf is mentioned, 
simply because they haven’t been 
exposed to anything else. 

I want to see a science-fiction 
program aimed at its fans and not 
garbage truck drivers. I want to see 
aliens as allies of Terrans. I want 
to see stories like Green World, The 
Ballad of Lost OMell or the Retief 
stories brought to the TV screen. 
We can do away with childish at- 
tempts to produce simple horror. 
There are other emotions that sf 
could convey on TV. They could 
also do away with the ultra-sonic 
music which only detracts from the 
creation as a whole and actually 
alienates you from it. 

It can be done, too, with letters

like this one going from every sci- 
ence fiction fan to the networks. 
The volume of mail would be a 
torrent and enough to swing them 
around our way. I appeal. If you 
think of yourself as a science fic- 
tion fan, blow a nickel on a let- 
ter. A nickel is a small price to pay 
for TV science fiction drama of the 
type that we yearn for. — John D.

Dear Editor: 

I would like to ask a favor of 
you or your readers. If anyone 
knows of a club or discussion group 
in Tacoma, Washington, which meets 
to discuss science fiction, E.S.P., or 
similar subjects, will he please write 
to Hue and Cry or to my address 
below? A group outside of Tacoma 
will not do any good because I am 
severely crippled and transportation 
is difficult. Thank you for any help 
that can be given. — Janet G. Fox, 
2214 North Union, Tacoma 7,

Dear Editor: 

Be it known right at the inception 
that the document to follow consists 
entirely of personal opinions and 
therefore is of no practical value 
whatsoever. You may stop reading 
now if you wish. 

Hey, wait a minute! Come back! 
It was only a joke! A joke! . 
Please? 

The September ’64 issue of If will 
mark the beginning of my third year 
with your ’zine (yes. I’m one of the 
old readers) and I’d like to say right

now that the present product is a 
far cry from those rather shabby 
items of ’62. As if you didn’t know. 
If is now one of the best printed 
SF publications around. It’s a pity, 
though, that you use the color tint- 
ing only in the story titles and not 
in the actual illustrations thehiselves 
as you did in the January of ’63. 
Those Schelling illustrations for 
The Five Hells of Orion were beau- 
tiful. 

Speaking of illustrations, the cov- 
ers are good, too; the March, July 
and August wrapping in particular. 
Especially the August, even if k 
didn’t show anything that happened 
in the story (must have been one of 
those “fascinating missions”). 

But the pictures don’t keep the 
readers as buyers. (Very astute ob- 
servation, don’t you think?) (Well, 
that’s your prerogative.) And so we 
shall blithely trip onward to the next 
subject, to wit, the filler material 
between illos. 

Actually, I don’t have that much 
to say (although it won’t stop me) 
because most of your stories this

calendar year have met with my ap- 
proval (‘‘Bless Klonos!” breathes the 
editor thankfully). However. 

Although I have been reading 
SF for only six years, I like to con- 
sider myself a knowledgeable fan. 
I even own a few copies of maga- 
zines dating from the Middle Ages 
(i. e., 1948). But in all my readings 
I had never come across anything 
by the old master E. E. Smith. 
Therefore I looked forward to your 
May issue with some curiosity, even 
anticipation. Wish I could say the 
same now. The Imperial Stars, sir, 
was bad. The progres and denoue- 
ment of the tale yvas rather simple 
(I don’t mean uncomplicated) and 
the writing itself was, well, clumsy. 
As a matter of fact, though I hate 
to say it, the writing reminded me 
of my own story-writing style (you 
rejected one of my outpourings last 
year; remember?). In short, it leaves 
something to be desired. But all your 
other readers will probably love it. 

One more cavil and then we’ll 
go on to happier subjects. I find 
that the blurbs you use in your three 
magazines become very annoying,

not to mention tedious, when read

One more thing and then I’ll go 
bother some other editor. Mr. Pohl, 
sir, to settle a bone of contention 
between my left and right heads 
(this is the middle head speaking), 
would you tell us if you have ever 
employed the name Charles Satter- 
field as a pseudonym? — Peter 
Riley, 81 Crescent Street, New Lon- 
don, Connecticut 06320.

Dear Editor: 

I never before read any science- 
fiction magazines because from 
what I could see most of them were 
nothing but bunk. However, while 
I was glancing over a magazine 
stand, I noticed the name Robert 
A. Heinlein. Then I read the inside 
page and from what I saw, I knew 
I’d buy every issue of If for at 
least the next year. The serials you 
plan look great! The other stories 
in the July issue were good too, 
and I got a special kick out of 
Bixby’s Old Testament. No hue 
or cry, just praise for the one sf 
magazine with class. — Michael J. 
Hunter, Cleveland, Ohio. 

•Thanks for your letter, and we’l! 
see you next month. At least we 
hope we will — and we’re sure 
next month’s If will be a good one. 
Jack Vance who won the Hugo for 
The Drapon Masters, which appear- 
ed in Galaxy, now comes to If with 
The Killing Machine, and it just 
might win him another! And in the 
same issue a new Retief story by 
Keith Laumer — a novelette by 
Wilson Tucker — oh, yes, a good 
issue! — The Editor.
