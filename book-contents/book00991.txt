The Current GALAXY Science Fiction Novel . , 

FOUR-SIDED TRIANGLE 

By William F. Temple 

Two men in love with the some girl . that's about the most 
elementary plot anyone could devise. But what happens to 
that same plot when both men are scientists who invent a mat- 
ter-duplicating machine that will reproduce onything — inc/uding 
the girl they are in love with? 

You no longer have the trite old triangle. Instead, you have 
what the author describes as a FOUR-SIDED TRIANGLE, with 
two men in love with the same girl, of whom there is an original 
and a copy! 

Don't try to take it from there. You can't possibly anticipate 
the complications, conflict — the suspense of this remarkable 
situation, and especially the ingenious resolution. 

Swiftly paced, rollicking, yet shrewdly thoughtful, FOUR- 
SIDED TRIANGLE is a real high-water mark in science fiction 
humor.

ferent, the top of the science fiction book list) to .

Homeless Facts 



I N the introduction to the 
GALAXY Science Fiction 
Reader, I made a point that 
I think can use more exploration. 

That was the accidental land- 
ing of PenicilUum notatum in a 
germ culture in 1929. the obser- 
vation that it left a circle of 
dead bacteria around it . and 
no follow-up to learn why! 

Had a writer of that paleolithic 
era of science fiction come across 
the item, he doubtless would have 
had a noble collegiate, a pure 
flapper and a wicked cartel for 
suspense, the compulsory eating 
of moldy bread, all disease wiped 
out. and everyone immortal as a 
resj^lt. The story, I remarked, 
would have been a literary gou- 
lash, but it might have interested 
some biochemist in pushing the 
experiment . and we mi^hi 
have had penicillin 15 years be- 
fore we acfua//y did! 

Even more, the lines of re- 
search that penicillin opened up 
would have been advanced by 15 
years, which, judging by the prog- 
ress of the last decade, is enough 
to establish a whole new phar- 
macology. Lord knows what we 
might have had by now if that 
story had actually been written 
at that time. 

It’s a saddening thought, for 
everyone has relatives and friends 



whose lives could have been saved 
by antibiotics. 

If you really want to be de- 
pressed, though, just consider the 
number of similar observations 
that cannot be reported. The case 
of the Flying Saucers happens to 
be the most dramatic one at the 
moment. Whatever the Navy may 
say, not all instances can be 
explained as Skyhook balloons 
or the planet Venus; too many 
of those who have seen the phe- 
nomena would have recognized 
either. There is a good chance 
that the mystery could be solved 
... if these reliable witnesses 
could report their findings with- 
out fear of ridicule or dismissal. 

Nobody can guess at the 
amount of data we are being de- 
prived of for those two reasons, 
plus one more that I will come 
to later. It must be truly enor- 
mous. Even if it consisted of only 
one item a year, like that of 
PenicilUum notatum, we still 
would be poorer for not knowing. 

Meteorites are an encouraging 
example of a problem that was 
solved. Less than 150 years ago, 
there were no meteorites at all. 
Stars fell through the sky. of 
course, and hot stones were dis- 
covered lying on the ground. But 
the falling stars were regarded 
as literally that; the hot stones 



t 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



were assumed to be debris from 
a distant volcano. Science had 
simply not advanced far enough 
to explain them as bits of inter* 
planetary rock that had been 
heated to incandescence by air 
friction. 

-For all our superior knowledge, 
there still are huge gaps to be 
filled, more than enough to keep 
us from smiling smugly at the 
ignorance of our ancestors. We 
know about meteorites, but do 
we know about sea serpents? 

Naturally, sea serpents don’t 
exist. Or is it the reliable reports 
of them that do not exist? Willy 
Ley has recorded many cases of 
trained observers, unwise enough 
to announce having seen them, 
who suffered lifelong jeers. The 
lesson was sharp enough to keep 
others from repeating the error. 
Yet so many other rumored flora 
and fauna were later authenti- 
cated that the lesson is clearly 
a false one. 

Besides ridicule and dismissal, 
I mentioned a third reason for 
guarded silence: the lack of a 
legitimate place to which to re- 
port phenomena that cannot be 
explained at present. 

Science, unfortunately, has 
abandoned this function to the 
followers of Charles Fort. I do 
not intend to discredit the For- 
tean Society, but the Society, 
with its hostility toward science, 
is not the place I had in mind. 



What is urgently needed, and 
has been for a long time, is a 
scientific bureau, journal, agency 
— anything at all that has con- 
tact with researchers who can 
rely on it both for objectivity 
and available data. 

GALAXY is not the ideal me- 
dium for such information: no 
science fiction magazine could be. 
Its space must be devoted pri- 
marily to stories, and will be. 

But in the absence of any other, 
GALAXY offers whatever facili- 
ties it has. Reports can be turned 
over to Willy Ley for possible 
inclusion or condensation in his 
monthly department, with the 
assurance that he can tell au- 
thentic reports from phonies. 
Where further correspondence is 
required, he will, of course, dig 
for more information. 

The name and address of the 
observer must accompany the 
report; both will be withheld on 
request. 

We do not delude ourselves 
that GALAXY can accomplish 
the job as well as a trained and 
staffed scientific agency. But the 
least we can do is try to serve 
until one comes along. When it 
docs, you may be sure that we 
will step aside . , and grate- 
fully, first because we are not well 
enough equipped, and second be- 
cause it vdll be glad news. And 
high time, tool

C AMERON frowned intently 
at the top of the desk. It 
was difficultto concentrate 
under the circumstances. “Your 
request was turned over to the 
Medicouncil,** he said, “After 
studying it, they reported back to 
tfie Solar Committee.* 



Docchi edged forward, his face 
literally lighting up. 

Dr. Cameron kept his eyes 
averted; the man was damnably 
disconcerting. “You know what 
the answer is. A flat no, for the 
present.* 

Docchi leaned back. “We

should have expected that,” he 
said wearily. 

“It's not entirely hopeless. De- 
cisions like this can always be 
changed.” 

“Sure,” said Docchi. “We’ve 
got centuries.” His face was 
flushed — blazing would be a bet- 
ter description. 

Absently, Cameron lowered the 
lights in the room as much as he 
could. It was still uncomfortably 
bright. Docchi was a nuisance. 

“But why?” asked Docchi. 
“You know that we're capable. 
Why did they refuse?” 

Cameron had tried to avoid 
that question. Now it had to be 
answered with blunt brutality. 
“Did you think you .would be 
chosen? Or Nona, or Jordan, or 
Anti?” 

Docchi winced. “Maybe not. 
But we’ve told you that we’re 
willing to abide by what the ex- 
perts say. Surely from a thousand 
of us they can select one quali- 
fied crew.” 

“Perhaps so,” said Cameron. 
He switched on the lights and re- 
sumed staring at the top of the 
desk. “Most of you are biocom- 
pensators. Ninety per cent. I be- 
lieve. I concede that we ought to 
be able to get together a com- 
petent crew.” He sighed. “But 
you’re wasting your time discuss- 
ing this with me. I’m not respon- 
sible for the decision. I can’t do 
anything about it.” 



Docchi stood up. His face was 
colorless and bright. 

Df. Cameron looked at him di- 
rectly for the first time. “I sug- 
gest you calm down. Be patient 
and wait; you may get your 
chance.” 

“You wait,” said Docchi. “We 
don’t intend to.” 

The door opened for him and 
closed behind him. 

Cameron concentrated on the 
desk. Actually he was trying to 
look through it. He wrote down 
the card sequence he expected to 
find. He opened a drawer and 
gazed at the contents, then grim- 
aced in disappointment. No mat- 
ter how many times he tried, he 
never got better than strictly av- 
erage results. Maybe there was 
something to telepathy, but he 
hadn’t found it yet. 

He dismissed it from his mind. 
It was a private game, a method 
of avoiding involvement while 
Docchi was present. But Docchi 
Was gone now, and he had better 
come up with some answers. The 
right ones. 

He switched on the telecom. 
“Get me Medicouncilor Thorton,” 
he told the robot operator. “Di- 
rect, if you can; indirect if you 
have to. I’ll wait.” 

With an approximate mean di- 
ameter of thirty miles, the aster- 
oid was listed on the charts as 
Handicap Haven. The regular in- 
habitants were willing to admit 



9 



ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT 



the handicap part of the name, 
but they didn’t call it haven. 
There were other terms, none of 
them suggesting sanctuary. 

It was a hospital, of course, 
but even more like a convales- 
cent home, the permanent kind. 
A healthy and vigorous humanity 
had built it for those few who 
were less fortunate. A splendid 
gesture, but, like many such ges- 
tures, the reality fell somewhat 
short of the original intentions. 

The robot operator interrupted 
his thoughts. “Medicouncilor 
Thorton will speak to you.** 

The face of an older man filled 
the screen. **00 my way to the 
satellites of Jupiter. I’ll be in di- 
rect range for the next half hour.’* 
At ^ch distance, transmission 
and reception were practically in- 
stantaneous. “You wanted to 
speak to me about the Solar Com- 
mittee reply?” 

**I do. I informed Docchi a few 
minutes ago.” 

“How did he react?” 

“He didn’t like it. As a matter 
of fact, he was mad all the way 
through.” 

“That speaks well for his men- 
tal resiliency.” 

“They all seem to have enough 
spirit, though, and nothing to use 
it on,” said Dr. Cameron. “I con- 
fess I didn’t look at him often, 
in spite of the fact that he was 
quite presentable. Handsome, 
even, in a startling way.” 

• 



Thorton nodded. “Presentable. 
That means he had arms.” 

“He did. Is that important?** 
“I think it is. He expected a 
favorable reply and wanted to 
look his best. As nearly normal 
as possible.” 

“Trouble?” 

“I don’t see how,” said the 
medicouncilor uncertainly. “In 
any event, not immediately. It 
will take them some time to get 
over the shock of refusal. They 
can’t do anything, really. Indi- 
vidually they're helpless. Collec- 
tively — ^there aren’t parts for a 
dozen sound bodies on the as- 
teroid.” 

“I’ve looked over the records,** 
said Dr. Cameron. “Not one acci- 
dental has ever liked being on 
Handicap Haven, and that cov- 
ers quite a few years. But there 
has never been so much open 
discontent as there is now.” ' 
“Someone is organizing them. 
Find out who and keep a close 
watch.” 

“I know who. Docchi, Nona, 
Anti, and Jordan. But it doesn’t 
do any good merely to watch 
them. I want your permission to 
break up that combination. Hu- 
manely, of course.” 

“How do you propose to do It?** 
“Docchi, for instance. With 
prosthetic arms he appears physi- 
cally normal, except for that un- 
canny luminescence. That is re- 
pulsive to the average person.

Medically there’s nothing we can 
do about it, but psychologically 
we might be able to make it into 
an asset. You’re aware that 
Gland Opera is the most popular 
program in the Solar System. 
Telepaths, teleports, pyrotics and 
to forth are the heroes. All fake, 
of course : makeup and trick 
camera shots. But Docchi can be 
made into a real live star. The 
death-ray man, say. When his 
face shines, men fall dead or par- 
alyzed. He’d have a chance to 
return to normal society under 
conditions that would be men- 
tally acceptable to him.” 

“Acceptable to him, perhaps, 
but not to society,” reflected the 
medicouncilor. "An ingenious 
idea, one which does credit to 
your humanitarian outlook. Only 
it won’t work. You have Docchi’s 
medical record, but you probably 
don’t know his complete history. 
He was an electrochemical en- 
gineer, specializing in cold light- 
ing. He seemed on his way to a 
brilliant career when a particu- 
larly messy accident occurred. 
The details aren’t important. He 
was badly mangled and tossed 
into a tank of cold lighting fluid 
by automatic machinery. It was 
some time before he was dis- 
covered. 

“There was a spark of life left 
and we managed to save him. We 
had to amputate his arms and 
ribs practically to his spinal col- 



umn. The problem of regenera- 
tion wasn’t as easy as it usually 
is. We were able to build up a 
new rib case; that's as much as 
we could do. Under such condi- 
tions, prosthetic arms are merely 
ornaments. They can be fastened 
to him and they look all right, 
but he can’t use them. He has no 
back or shoulder muscles to an- 
chor them to. 

“And add to that the adapta- 
tion his body made while he was 
in the tank. The basic cold light- 
ing fluid, as you know, is semi- 
organic. It permeated every tissue 
in his body. By the time we 'got 
him, it was actually a neces- 
sary part of his metabolism. A 
corollary, I suppose, of the funda- 
mental biocompensation theory.** 

The medicouncilor paused and 
shook his head. “I’m afraid your 
idea is out, Dr. Cameron. I don’t 
doubt that he would be successful 
^ the program you mention. But 
there is more to life on the out- 
side than success. Can you pic- 
ture the dead silence when he 
walks into a room of normal 
people?” 

“I see,” said Cameron, though 
he didn’t, at least not eye to eye. 
The medicouncilor was convinced 
and there was nothing Cameron 
could do to alter that convic- 
tion. “The other one I had in 
mind was Nona,” he added. 

“I thought so.” Thorton 
glanced at the solar chronome-

ter. *‘I haven’t much time, but 
I’d better explain. You’re new 
to the post • and I don’t think 
you’ve learned yet to evaluate 
the patients and their problems 
properly. In a sense, Nona is 
more impossible than Docchi. He 
was once a normal person. She 
never was. Her appearance is sat- 
isfactory; perhaps she’s quite 
pretty, though you must remem- 
ber that you’re seeing her under 
circumstances that may make her 
seem more attractive than she 
really is, 

“She can’t talk or hear. She 
never will. She doesn’t have a 
larynx, and it wouldn’t help if 
we gave her one. She simply 
doesn’t have the nervous system 
necessary for speech or hearing. 
Her %rain is definitely not struc- 
turally normal. As far as we’re 
concerned, that abnormality is 
not in the nature of a mutation. 
It’s more like an anomaly. On^ 
cleft palates were frequent — pre- 
natal nutritional deficiencies or 
traumas. Occasionally we still 
run into cases like that, but our 
surgical techniques arc always 
adequate. Not with Nona, how- 
ever. 

“She can’t be taught to read 
or write; we’ve tried it. We dug 
out the old' Helen Keller tech- 
niques and brought them up to 
date with no results. Apparently 
her mind doesn’t work in a hu- 
man fashion. We question 



whether very much of it works 
at all.” 

“That might be a starting 
point,” said Cameron. "If her 
brain — ” 

"Gland Opera stuff,” inter- 
rupted Thorton. “Or Rhine Op- 
era, if you’ll permit me to coin 
a term. We’ve thought of it, but 
it isn’t true. We’ve tested her for 
every telepathic quality that the 
Rhine people list. Again no re- 
sults. She has no special mental 
capacities. Just to make sure of 
that, we’ve given her periodic 
checkups. One last year, in fact.” 

Cameron frowned in frustra- 
tion. “Then it’s your opinion that 
she’s not able to survive in a 
normal society?” 

“That’s it,” answered the medi- 
councilor bluntly. “You’ll have 
to face the truth — you can’t get 
rid of any of them.” 

“With or without their cooper- 
ation, I’ll manage,” said Cam- 
eron. 

“I’m sure you will.” The medi- 
councilor’s manner didn’t ooze 
confidence. “Of course, if you 
need help we can send reinforce- 
ments.” 

The implication was clear 
enough. “I’ll keep them out of 
trouble,” Cameron promised. 

The picture and the voice were 
fading. “It’s up to you. If it 
turns out to be too difficult, get 
in touch with the Medicoun- 
cil , . .”

The robot operator broke in: 
“The ship is beyond direct tele- 
com range. If you wish to con- 
tinue the conversation, it will 
have to be relayed through the 
nearest main station. At present, 
that is Mars.” 

Aside from the time element, 
wliich was considerable, it wasn’t 
likely that he would get any bet- 
ter answers than he could supply 
for himself. Cameron shook his . 
head. “We are through, thanks.” 

He got heavily to his feet. That 
wasn’t a psychological reaction 
at all. He really was heavier. !^e 
made a mental note. He would 
have to investigate. 

In a way they were pathetic — 
the patchwork humans, the half 
or quarter men and women, the 
fractional organisms masquerad- 
ing as people — an illusion which 
died hard for them. Medicine and 
surgery were partly to blame. 
Techniques were too good, or not 
good enough, depending on the 
viewpoint. 

Too good in that the most hor- 
ribly injured person, if he were 
still alive, could be kept alive. 
Not good enough because a per- 
centage of the injured couldn’t 
be returned to society completely 
sound and whole. There weren’t 
many like that; but there were 
some, and all of them were on 
the asteroid. 

They didn’t like it. At least 
they didn’t like being con^ned to 



Handicap Haven. It wasn’t that 
they wanted to go back to the 
society of the normals, for they 
realized how conspicuous they’d 
be among the multitudes of beau- 
tiful, healthy people on the 
planets. 

What the accidentals did want 
was ridiculous. They desired, 
they hoped, they petitioned to be 
the first to make the long, hard 
journey to Alpha and Proxima 
Centauri in rockets. Trails of 
glory for those that went; a vi- 
carious share in it for those who 
couldn’t. 

Nonsense. The broken people, 
those without a face they could 
call their own, those who wore 
their, hearts not on their sleeves, 
but th a blood-pumping chamber, 
those either without limbs or or- 
gans — or too many. The cate- 
gories seemed endless. 

The accidentals were qualified, 
true. In fact, of all the billions of 
solar citizens, they alone could 
make the journey and return. But 
there were other factors that ruled 
them out. The first point was 
never safe to discuss with them, 
especially if the second had to be 
explained. It would take a sa- 
distic nsfture that Cameron didn’t 
possess.

shade overhead. Waves lapped 
and made gurgling sounds against 
the sides. No plant life of any 
kind grew and no fish swam in 
the liquid. It looked like water, 
but it wasn’t. It was acid. In it 
floated something that mon- 
strously resembled a woman. 

“They turned us down. Anti,'* 
Docchi said bitterly. 

“Didn’t you expect it?” the 
creature in the pool asked. 

*T guess I didn’t.” 

“You don’t know the Medi- 
council very well.” 

“Evidently I don’t.” He stared 
sullenly at the faintly blue fluid. 
“Why did they turn us down?” 
“Don’t you know?” 

“All right, I know,” he said. 
“Thtjv’re pretty irrational.”* 

“OT course, irrational. Let them 
be that way, as long as we don’t 
follow their example.” 

“I wish I knew what to do,” 
he said. “Cameron suggested we 
wait.’’ 

“Biocompensation,” murmured 
Anti, stirring restlessly. “They’ve 
always saicf that. Up to now it’s 
always worked.” 

“What else can we do?” asked 
Docchi. Angrily he kicked at an 
anemic tuft of grass. “Draw up 
another request?” 

“Memorandum number ten? 
Let’s not be naive about it. Things 
get lost so easily in the Medi- 
council’s filing system.” 

“Or distorted," grunted Docchi,

“Maybe we should give the 
Medicouncil a rest. They’re tired 
of hearing us anyway.” 

“I see what you mean,” said 
Docchi, rising. 

“Better talk to Jordan about 
it.” 

“I intend to. I’ll need arms.” 
“Good. I’ll see you when you 
leave for far Centauri.” 

“Sooner than that, Anti. Much 
sooner.” 

Stars were beginning to wink. 
Twilight brought out shadows 
and tracery of the structure that 
supported the transparent dome 
overhead. Soon controlled slow 
rotation would bring darkness to 
this side of the asteroid. 

C AMERON leaned back and 
looked speculatively at the 
gravital engineer, Vogel. The man 
could give him considerable as- 
sistance, if he would. There was 
no reason why he shouldn’t; but 
any man who had voluntarily re- 
mained on Handicap Haven as 
long as Vogel had was a doubt- 
ful quantity. 

“Usually we maintain about 
half Earth-normal gravity,” Ca- 
meron said. “Isn’t that correct?” 
Engineer Vogel nodded. 

“It isn’t important why those % 
limits were set,” Cameron con- 
tinued. “Perhaps it’s easier on 
the weakened bodies of the ac- 
cidentals. There may be economic 
factors.” 



ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT 



11 



“No reason for those limits ex- 
cept the gravital units them- 
selves,” Vogel said. “Theoretical- 
ly it should be easy to get any 
gravity you want. Practically, 
though, we get between a quarter 
and almost full Earth gravity. 
Now take the fluctuations. The 
gravital computer is set at fifty 
per cent. Sometimes we get fifty 
per cent and sometimes seventy- 
five. Whatever it is, it just is and 
we have to be satisfied.” 

The big engineer shrugged. “I 
hear the units were designed es- 
pecially for this asteroid,” he 
went on, “Some fancy medical 
reason. Easier on the accidentals 
to have less gravity change, you 
say. Me, I dunno. I’d guess the 
designers couldn’t help it and the 
reason was dug up later.” 

Cameron concealed his irrita- 
tion. He wanted information, not 
a heart-to-heart confession. “All 
practical sciences try to justify 
whatever they can’t escape but 
would like to. Medicine, I’m sure, 
is no exception.” He paused 
thoughtfully. “Now, there are 
three separate gravital units on 
the asteroid. One runs for forty- 
five minutes while the other two 
are idle. Then it cuts off and an- 
other takes over. This is sup- 
posed to be synchronized. I don't 
have to tell you that it isn’t. You 
felt your weight increase sudden- 
ly at the same time 1 did. What 
is wrong?’* 



“Nothing wrong,” said the en- 
gineer. “That’s what you get with 
gravital.” 

“You mean they’re supposed to 
run that way? Overlapping so 
that for five minutes we have 
Earth or Earth-and-a-half grav- 
ity and then none?” 

“It’s not supposed to be tliat 
way,” said Vogel. “But nobody 
ever built a setup like this that 
worked any better.” He added 
defensively: “Of course, if you 
want, you can check with the 
company that makes these units.” 
“I’m not trying to challenge 
your knowledge, and I’ra not 
anxious to make myself look 
silly. I have a sound reason for 
asking these questions. There is 
a possibility of sabotage." 

The engineer’s grin was ^der 
than the remark seemed to re- 
quire. 

“AH right,” said Cameron tir- 
edly. “Suppose you tell me why 
sabotage is so unlikely.” 

“Well,” explained the gravital 
engineer, “it would have to be 
someone living here, and he 
wouldn’t like it if he suddenly 
got double or triple gravity or 
maybe none at all. But there’s 
another reason. Now take a grav- 
ital unit. Any gravital unit Most 
people think of it as just diat— 
a iinit It isn’t really that at alL 
It has three parts. 

*'One part m a power source^

it’s big enough. Our power source 
is a nuclear pile, buried deep in 
the asteroid. You’d have to take 
Handicap Haven apart to get to 
it. Part two is the gravital coil, 
which actually produces the grav* 
ity and is simple and just about 
indestructible. Part three is the 
gravital control. It calculates the 
relationship between the amount 
of power flowing through the 
gravital coil and the strength of 
the created gravity field in any 
one microsecond. It uses the 
computed relationship to alter 
the power flowing through in the 
next microsecond to get the same 
gravity. No change of power, no 
gravity. I guess you could call 
the control unit a computer, as 
good a one as is made for any 
purpose.** 

The engineer rubbed his chin. 
*^Fatigue,” he continued. **The 
gravital control is an intricate 
computer that’s subject to fa- 
tigue. That’s why it has to rest 
an hour and a half to do forty- 
five minutes of work. Naturally 
they don’t want anyone tinker- 
ing with it It’s non-repairable. 
Crack the case open and it won’t 
work. But first you have to open 
it. Mind you, that can be done. 
But I wouldn’t want to try it 
without n high-powered lab set- 
up.” 

If it didn’t seem completely 
foolproof, neither did it seem a 
likely source of trouble. "Then 

ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT 



we can forget about the gravital 
units,” said Cameron, arising. 
“But what about hand weapons? 
Are there any available?” 

“You mean toasters?” 
“Anything that’s lethal.” 
“Nothing. No knives even. 
Maybe a stray bar or so of 
metal.” Vogel scratched his head. 
“There is something dangerous, 
though. Dangerous if you know 
how to take hold of it.” 

Instantly Cameron was alert. 
“What’s that?” 

“Why, the asteroid itself. You 
can’t physically touch any part 
of the gravital unit. But if you 
could somehow sneak an impulse 
into the computer and change 
the direction of the field . .” 
Vogel was very grave. “You 
could pick up Handicap Haven 
and throw it anywhere you want- 
ed. At the Earth, say. Thirty 
miles in diameter is a big hunk 
of rock.** 

It was this kind of informa- 
tion Cameron was looking for, 
though the engineer seemed to 
regard the occasion as merely a 
social call. “Is there any possi- 
bility of that occurring?” he ask- 
ed quietly. 

The engineer grinned. “Never 
happened, but they’re ready for 
things like that with any gravital 
system. They got monitor sta- 
tions all over — the moons of 
Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus. 
*‘Any time the gravital com- 

IS 



puter gets dizzy, the monitor 
overrides it. If that fails, they 
send a jammer impulse and 
freeze it up tight. It won’t work 
until they let loose.” 

Cameron sighed. He was get- 
ting very little help or informa- 
tion from Vogel. “All right,” he 
said. “You’ve told me what I 
wanted to know.” 

He watched the engineer de- 
part for the gravity-generating 
chamber far below the surface of 
the asteroid. 

^^HE post on Handicap Haven 
wasn’t pleasant; it wasn’t an 
experience a normal human 
would desire. It did have advan- 
tages — advancement came in 
sizes^ directly proportional to the 
dishgreeableness of the place. 

Ten months to go on a year’s 
assignment. If Cameron could 
survive that period with nothing 
to mar his administration, he was 
in line for better positions. A sui- 
cide or any other kind of un- 
pleasantness that would focus the 
attention of the outside world on 
the forgotten asteroid was defi- 
nitely unwelcome. 

He flipped on the telecom. 
“Rocket dome. Get me the pilot.” 
When the robot finally answer- 
ed, it wasn’t encouraging. “I’m 
sorry. There is no answer.” 
“Then trace him,” he snapped. 
'*If he’s not in the rocket dome, 
he’s in the main dome. 1 want 



you to get him at once.” 

A few seconds of silence fol- 
lowed. “There is no record of the 
pilot leaving the rocket dome.” 
His heart skipped; with an ef- 
fort he spoke carefully. “Scan 
the whole area. Understand? 
You’ve got to find him.” 

“Scanning is not possible. The 
system is out of operation in that 
area.” 

“All right,” he said, starting to 
shake. “Send out repair robots.” 
They were efficient in the sense 
they always did the work they 
were set to do, but not in terma 
of speed. 

“The robots were dispatched as 
soon as scanning failed to work. 
Are there any other instructions?” 
He thought about that. He 
needed help, plenty of it. Vogel? 
He’d be ready and willing, but 
that would leave the gravity- 
generating setup unprotected. 
Better do without him. 

Who else? The sour old nurse 
who’d signed up because she 
wanted quick credits toward re- 
tirement? Or the sweet young 
thing who had bravely volun- 
teered because someone ought to 
help those poor unfortunate men? 
Not the women, of course. She 
had a bad habit of fainting when 
she saw blood. Probably that 
was why she couldn't get a posi- 
tion in a regular planetary hos- 
pital. 

That was all, except the ro- 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



bots, who weren’t much help in 
a case like this. That and the 
rocket pilot. For some reason he 
wasn’t available. 

The damned place was under- 
manned. Always had been. No- 
body wanted to come except the 
mildly psychotic, the inefficient 
end lazy, or, conceivably, an am- 
bitious young doctor like himself. 
Mentally, Cameron berated the 
last category. If anything serious 
happened here, such a doctor 
might end his career bandaging 
scratches at a children’s play- 
ground. 

“Instructions,” he said. “Yes. 
Leave word in gravity-generating 
for Vogel. Tell him to throw 
everything he’s got around the 
units. Watch them.” 

“Is that all?” 

“Not quite. Send six general 
purpose robots. I'll pick them up 
at the entrance to the rocket 
dome.” 

“Repair robots are already in 
that area. Will they do as well?” 

“They will not. I want geepees 
for another reason.” They 
wouldn’t be much help, true, but 
the best he could manage. 

D OCCHI waited near the rock- 
et dome. Not hiding, merely 
inconspicuous among the care- 
fully nurtured shrubbery that 
was supposed to give the illusion 
of Earth. If the plants failed in 
that respect, at least they con- 



tributed to the oxygen supply of 
the asteroid. 

“Good girl,” said Docchi. 
“That Nona is wonderful.” 

Jordan could feel him relax. 
“A regular mechanical marvel,” 
he agreed. “But we can gas about 
that later. Let’s get going.” 

Docchi glanced around and 
then walked boldly into the pas- 
sageway that connected the main 
dome with the much smaller, ad- 
jacent rocket dome. Normally, it 
was never dark in the inhabited 
parts of the asteroid: a modula- 
ted twilight was considered more 
conducive to the slumber of the 
handicapped. But it wasn’t twi- 
light as they, neared the rocket 
dome — it was a full-scale rehears- 
al for the darkness of inter- 
planetary space. 

Docchi stopped before the 
emergency airlock which loomed 
solidly in front of them. “I hope 
Nona was able to cut this out 
of the circuit,” he said anxiously. 

“She understood, didn’t she?” 
asked Jordan. He reached out and 
the great slab moved easily aside 
in its grooves. “The trouble with 
you is that you lack confidence.” 
Docchi. listening with a frown, 
didn’t answer. 

“Okay, I hear it, too,” whis- 
pered Jordan. “We’d better get 
well inside before he reaches us.” 
Docchi walked rapidly into the 
darkness of the rocket dome. He 
allowed his face to become faint-

ly luminescent, the one part of 
his altered metabolism that he 
had learned to control, when he 
wasn’t under emotional strain. 

He was nervous now. but his 
control had to be right. Enough 
light so that he’d be noticed, not 
so much that details of his ap- 
pearance would be plain. 

The footsteps came nearer, ac- 
companied by a steady volume 
of profanity. Docchi flashed his 
face opce and then lowered the 
intensity almost immediately. 

The footsteps stopped. “Doc- 
chi?” 

“No. Just a lonely little light 
bulb out for an evening stroll.” 

The rocket pilot’s laughter 
wasn’t altogether friendly. “I 
kno\%it’s you. I meant, what are 
you doing here?” 

“I saw the lights in the rocket 
dome go out. The entrance was 
open, so I came in. Maybe I can 
help.” 

“They’re off, all right. Every- 
thing. Even the standby system.” 
The rocket pilot moved closer. 
The deadly little toaster was in 
his hand. “You can’t help. You’d 
better get out. It’s against regu- 
lations for you to be in here.” 

Docchi ignored the weapon. 
“What happened? Did a meteor 
■trike?” 

The pilot grunted. “Not like- 
ly.” He peered intently at the 
barely visible silhouette. “Well, 
I see you’re getting smart. You 



should do that all the time. You 
look better that way, even if 
they’re not usable arms. You 
look . .” His voice faded away. 

“Sure, almost human,” Doc- 
chi finished for him. “Not like 
a pair of legs and a spinal column 
with a lightning bug stuck on 
top.” 

“I didn’t say that. So you’re 
sensitive about it, eh? Maybe 
that’s not your fault. Anyway, 
you’d better get going.” 

“But I don’t want to go,” said 
Docchi deliberately. “I’m not 
afraid of the dark. Are you?” 

“Cut the psycho talk, Docchi. 
All your circuits are working and 
you know it. Now get out of here 
before I take your fake hand and 
drag you out.” 

“Now you’ve hurt my feelings,” 
declared Docchi reproachfully, 
nimbly stepping away. 

“You asked for it,” growled the 
pilot, lunging after him. What he 
took hold of wasn’t an imitation 
hand, made of plastic. It was 
flesh and blood. That was why 
the pilot screamed, once, before 
he was lifted off his feet and 
slammed to the floor, 

Docchi bent double. The dark 
figure on his back came over his 
head like a sword from a scab- 
bard. 

“Jor— " 

“Yeah,” said Jordan. 

He wrapped one arm around 
the pilot’s throat and clamped it 



1 « 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tight. With the other he felt for 
the toaster the- pilot still held. 
Effortlessly he tore it away and 
used the butt with just enough 
force to knock the pilot uncon- 
scious without smashing the skull. 
Docchi stood by until it was 
over. All he could offer was an 
ineffectual kick, not balanced by 
arms. 

It wasn’t needed. 

“Let there be light,” ordered 
Jordan, laughing, and there was, 
a feeble, flickering illumination 
from Docchi. 

Jordan was balancing himself 
on his hands. A strong head, mas- 
sive, powerful arms and shoul- 
ders. His body ended at his chest. 
A round metal capsule contained 
his digestive system. 

“Dead?” Docchi looked down 
at the pilot. 

Jordan rocked forward and lis- 
tened for the heartbeat. “Nah,” 
he said. “I remembered in time 
that we can’t afford to kill any- 
one.” 

“Good,” said Docchi. and sti- 
fled an exclamation as something 
coiled around his leg. His reac- 
tions were fast ; he broke loose 
almost instantly. 

“Repair robot,” said Jordan, 
looking , around. “The place is 
lousy with them.” 

Docchi blinked on and off in- 
voluntarily and the robot came 
toward him. 

“Friendly creature,” observed 



Jordan. “He’s offering to fix your 
lighting system for you.” 

Dochi ignored the squat con- 
trivance and stared at the pilot. 
“Now what?’’ he asked. 

“Agreed,” said Jordan. “He 
needs attention. Not the- kind I 
gave him.” He balanced the toas- 
ter in his hand and burned a 
small hole in the .little wheeled 
monster. Tentacles emerged from 
the side of the machine and felt 
puzzledly at the damaged area. 
The tentacles were withdrawn 
and presently reappeared with a 
small torch and began v/elding. 

Jordan pulled the unconscious 
pilot toward him. He leaned 
against the machine, raised t’ne 
inert form over his head and 
laid it gently on the top flat sur- 
face. Another tentacle reached 
out to investigate the body of the 
pilot. Jordan welded the joiate 
solid with the toaster. Three times 
he repeated the process until the 
pilot was fastened to the robot. 

4 “The thing will stay here, re- 
pairing itself, until it's complete- 
ly sound again,” remarked Jor- 
dan. “However, that can be 
fixed.” He adjusted the toaster 
beam to an imperceptible thick- 
ness. Deftly he sliced through the 
control case and removed a cir- 
cular section. He reached inside 
and ripped out circuits. “No fur- 
ther self-repair,” he said cheer- 
fully. “Now J'm going to need 
your help. From a time stand-

point, I think it’s a good idea 
to run the robot around the main 
dome a few times before it de- 
livers the pilot to the hospital. 
No point in giving ourselves away 
before we’re ready.” 

Docchi bent over the robot, and 
with his help the proper sequence 
was implanted. The machine 
scurried erratically away. 

Docchi watched it go. ^Time 
for us to be on our way.” He bent 
double for Jordan. The arms 



folded around his neck, but Jor- 
dan made no effort to climb up 
onto his back. For a panic mo- 
ment Docchi knew how the pilot 
felt when strength, where there 
shouldn’t have ^been strength, 
reached out from the darkness 
and gripped his throat. 

He shook the thought from his 
mind. "Get on my back,” he in- 
sisted. 

"You’re tired,” said Jordan. 
"Half gravity or not, you can’t 




U 



• AlAXY SCliNCE MCTtON 




carry me any farther.” His fingers 
worked swiftly and the carrying 
harness fell to the floor. “Stay 
down,” growled Jordan. “Listen.” 
Docchi listened. “Geepeesf** 
“Yeah,” said Jordan. “Now get 
to the rocket.” 

“What can I do when I get 
there? You’ll have to help me.” 
“You’ll figure something out 
when the time comes. Hurry 
up!” 

“Not without you,” said Doc- 




chi stubbornly, without moving. 

A huge paw clamped around 
the back of his skull. “Listen to 
me,” whispered Jordan fiercely. 
“Together we were a better man 
than the pilot — your legs and my 
arms. It’s up to us to prove that 
separately we are a match for 
Cameron and his geepees.” 
“We’re not trying to prove any- 
thing,” said Docchi. 

A brilliant light sliced through 
the darkness and swept around 
the rocket dome. 

“Maybe we are,” said Jordan. 
Impatiently, he hitched himself 
^ along the ground. “I fhink I am.” 
“What are you going to do?” 
“I’m going up. With no legs, 
that’s where I belong.” 

He grasped the structural steel 
member in his great hands, and 
in the light gravity, ascended 
rapidly. 

“Careful,” warned Docchi. 
“This is no time to be careful.” 
His voice floated down from high 
in the Tacy structure. It wasn’t 
completely dark; the lights were 
getting nearer. Docchi decided it 
was possible for Jordan to see 
what he was doing. 

They hadn’t expected to be dis- 
covered so soon. But the issue 
had not yet been settled against 
them. Docchi settled into a long 
stride, avoiding the low-slung re- 
pair robots that seemed to be 
everywhere. If Jordan refused to 
give up, Docchi had to try. 



He stayed well ahead of the 
oncoming general purpose robots. 

T¥E reached the rocket and 
barely had time to look 
around. It was enough, however. 
The ship’s passenger and freight 
locks were closed. Nona had 
either not understood all their 
instructions, or she hadn’t been 
able to carry them out. The first, 
probably. She had put the light 
and scanning circuits out of com- 
mission with no tools except her 
hands. That and her uncanny 
knowledge of the inner workings 
of machines. It was too much to 
expect that she should also have 
the ship ready and waiting for 
them. 

It was up to him to get in. 
If he had the toaster they’d taken 
from the pilot, he might have 
been able to soften the proper 
area of the, passenger lock. But 
he didn’t. Not having arms, he 
couldn’t have used it. For that 
reason Jordan had kept the wea- 
pon. 

The alternative was to search 
the surrounding mechanical jun- 
gle for an external control of the 
rocket. There had to be one, at 
least for the airlocks. Then it was 
a matter of luck whether he could 
work it. 

The approaching lights warned 
him that he no longer had that 
alternative. If Cameron hadn’t 
tried to search the rocket dome 



as he came along, the geepees 
would be solidly ringed around 
the ship now. That was Camer* 
on’s mistake, however, and he 
might make more. 

In all probability Jordan was 
still at large. Perhaps nearby. 
Would Cameron know that? He 
might not. 

Docchi descended into the shal- 
low landing pit. Until both of 
them were caught, there was al- 
ways a chance. He had to hide, 
but the landing pit seemed re- 
markably ill-suited for that pur- 
pose. 

He leaned against the stern 
tube cluster and tried to shake 
his brain into activity. The metal 
pressed hard into the thin flesh 
that covered his back. Ip the 
smooth glazed surface of the 
landing pit,’ the only answer was 
the tubes. 

He straightened up and looked 
into them. A small boy might 
climb inside and crawl out of 
sight. Or a grown man who had 
no shoulders or arms to get 
wedged in the narrow cylinder. 

Out in space, the inner ends of 
the tubes were closed with a com- 
bustion cap wherein the fuel was 
ignited. But in the dome, where 
the ship was not used for months 
at a time . 

Yes, there was that possibility. 

He tried a lower tube. He lay 
on the floor and thrust his head 
inside. He wriggled and shoved 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with his feet until he had forced 
himself entirely in. It was dark 
and terrifying, but no time for 
claustrophobia. 

•i He stopp>ed momentarily and 
listened. A geepee descended 
noisily into the landing pit. The 
absence of any other sound indi- 
cated to Docchi that it was radio- 
controlled. 

He drove himself on, though 
it was slow progress. The walls 
were smooth and it was difficult 
to get much purchase. The going 
became even tougher — the tube 
was getting smaller. Not much, 
but enough to matter. 

Again he stopped. Outside, 
there was the characteristic sput- 
ter, like frying, that the toaster 
beam made when it struck metal. 
A great clatter followed. 

. “Get him!” shouted Cameron. 
“He’s up there!” 

Jordan had arrived and had 
picked off a geepee. And it wasn’t 
going to be easy for Cameron to 
capture him. The diversion would 
help. 

“Don’t use heat,” ordered Cam- 
eron. “Get your lights on him. 
Blind him. Drive him in a corner 
and then go up and get him.” 

. Docchi had been wrong; the 
geepees were controlled by voice, 
not radio. That would make it 
easier for him once he got inside 
the ship. If he did. 

It looked as though he would. 
The tube wasn’t getting narrower. 



More important, the air was not 
noticeably stale. The combustion 
cap had been retracted, which 
was a lucky break. His feet slip- 
ped. It didn’t matter; somehow 
he inched along. Blood wa* 
pounding in his veins from the 
constriction, but his head emerg- 
ed in the rocket. 

He stared at the retracted com- 
bustion cap a fewVeet away. If 
he had arms, he could grasp it 
and pull himself free. But if he 
had arms, he would never have 
gotten this far. He wriggled until 
his body was nearly out and only 
his legs were in the tube. He 
kicked hard, fell to the floor. 

He lay there while his head 
cleared, then rolled to his feet and 
staggered forward to the control 
compartment. The rocket was his, 
but he didn’t want it for himself 
alone. 

He stared thoughtfully at the 
instrument panel. It had been a 
long time since he had operated 
a ship. When he understood the 
controls, he bent down and thrust 
his chin against the gravital dial. 
Laboriously he turned it to the 
proper setting. Then he sat dowa 
and kicked on a switch. The ship) 
rocked and rose a few inchei. 

Chances were that Cameroa 
wouldn’t notice that in the con- 
fusion outside. If he did, he had 
thirty seconds in which to stop 
Docchi. That wouldn’t be eaou|^ 
for Cameron. 



ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT

“Rocket landing,” said Docchi 
when the allotted time passed. 
“Emergency instructions. Emer- 
gency instructions. Stand by.” 
Strictly speaking, that wasn't 
necessary, for the frequency he 
was using assured him of com- 
plete control. 

“All energized geepees lend 
assistance. This order super- 
sedes previous orders. Additional 
equipment necessary.” After list- 
ing the equipment, he sat back 
and chuckled. 

With his knee he turned on the 
external lights, got up and walked 
to the passenger lock, brushing 
against the switch. The airlock 
opened. He stood boldly at the 
threshold and looked out. The 
rocket dome was floodlighted by 
the ship. 

“Aft right, Jordan, you can 
come down now,” he called. 

Jordan appeared overhead, 
hanging from a beam. He swung 
along it until he reached a col- 
umn, down which he descended. 
He propelled himself over the 
floor and up the ramp in his awk- 
ward fashion. Balancing on his 
hands, he gazed up at Docchi. 

“Well, monster, how did you 
do it?” 

“Monster yourself,” said Doc- 
chi. “Do what?” 

“I saw you crawl in the rocket 
tubes,” said Jordan. “But what 
did you do after you got inside?” 

“Cameron’s a medic,” said 



Docchi, “not mechanically in- 
clined. He forgot that an emer- 
gency rocket landing cancels any 
verbal orders. So I took the ship 
up a few inches. Geepees aren’t 
very bright; that satisfied them 
that I was coming in for a land- 
ing. What Cameron should have 
done was splash some heat 
against a gravital unit, and then, 
having created an artificial emer- 
gency condition in the main 
dome, he could have directed the 
geepees from the gravity control 
center. After that, he would have 
had top priority, not me.” 

“But they rushed off, carrying 
Cameron with them.” Jordan 
looked puzzled. 

“Easy. 1 told the geepees that 
there was danger of crashing and 
that they must remove any hu- 
man beings nearby, whether they 
were willing or not. You weren’t 
nearby and that let you out. They 
took Cameron because he was.” 

“It’s ours!” breathed Jordan. 
“But what about Anti and No- 
na?” 

“Anti’s taken care of. As far as 
the geepees are concerned, she 
comes under the heading of emer- 
gency landing material. They’ll 
bring her. Nona is supposed to be 
waiting with Anti.” Docchi frown- 
ed. “There’s nothing we can do 
if she isn’t. Meanwhile you’d 
better get ready to take the ship 
off.” 

Jordan swung himself inside. 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Docchi remained at the pas- 
senger lock, waiting. He heard the 
geepees first and saw them sec- 
onds later. They came into sight 
half pushing, half carrying a 
huge rectangular tank. With un- 
expected robotic ingenuity, they 
had mounted it on four of their 
smaller brethren, the squat re- 
pair robots, which served to sup- 
port the tremendous weight. 

The tank was filled with blue 
liquid. Twisted pipes dangled 
from the ends; it had been torn 
and lifted from its foundation. 
Broken plants still clung to the 
narrow ledge on top and moist 
soil adhered to the sides. Five 
geepees pushed it rapidly toward 
the ship, mechanically oblivious 
to the disheveled man who frus- 
tratedly shouted and struck at 
them. 

“Jordan, open the freight lock.” 

In response the ship rose a few 
more inches and hung quivering. 
A section of the ship hinged out- 
ward and downward to form a 
ramp. The ship was ready to take 
on cargo. 

Docchi stood at his post. That 
damn fool Cameron should have 
stayed in the main dome where 
the geepees had released him. His 
presence added an unwelcome 
complication. Still, it should be 
easy enough to get rid of him 
when the time came. 

It was Nona who really wor- 
ried him. She wasn’t anywhere 



to be seen. He took an uncertain 
step down the ramp, came back, 
shaking his head. It was impos- 
sible to look for her now, though 
he wanted to. 

The tank neared the ship. ■ A 
few feet of it projected onto the 
ramp. The geepees stopped; their 
efforts lost momentum. They 
looked bewildered. 

The tank rolled backward. The 
geepees shook, buzzed and looked 
around, primarily at Docchi. He 
didn’t wait any longer. He leaped 
into the ship. 

“Close the passenger lock!” he 
shouted. 

Jordan looked up questioningly 
from the controls. 

“Vogel, the engineer,” ex- 
plained Docchi. “He must have 
seen the geepees on scanning 
when they entered the main dome. 
He’s trying to do what Cameron 
should have done, but didn’t have 
enough sense to do.” 

The passenger lock swung pon- 
derously shxit behind him. 

“Now what?” Jordan asked, 
worried. 

“First, let’s see what you can 
get on the telecom,” said Docchi. 

The angle was impossible, so 
close to the ship, but they did 
manage to get a corner of the 
tank on the screen. Apparently it 
was resting where Docchi had 
last seen it, though it was difficult 
to be sure because the curve of 
the ship loomed so large.

“Maybe we’d better get out of 
here,” suggested Jordan nervous- 
ly- 

“Without the tank? Not a 
chance. Vogel hasn’t got com- 
plete control of them yet.” That 
seemed to be true. The geepees 
were nearly motionless, para- 
lyzed. 

“What shall I do?” asked 
Jordan. 

“Give me full power on the 
radio,” said Docchi. “Burn it out 
if you have to. I think the engi- 
neer is at the wrong angle to 
broadcast much power to them. 
Besides, the intervening struc- 
ture is absorbing most of his sig- 
nal.” 

He waited until Jordan had 
complied. “The tank must be 
placc^ in the ship,” he added. 

Geepees were not designed to 
sift contradictory commands that 
were nearly at the same level of 
urgency- Their reasoning power 
was feeble, but the mechanism 
was complicated enough. In that 
respect they resembled humans. 
Borderline decision.s were diffi- 
cult. 

“More power.” whispered Doc- 
chi. 

Sweating, Jordan obeyed. 

Marionettes. This string led 
toward a certain action. Another, 
intrinsically more important, but 
suddenly far less powerful, pulled 
for something else. Circuits burn-

Stiffly the geepees moved and 
grasped the tank. The quality of 
decision, in this case, was strain- 
ed. Inch by inch the tank rolled 
Up the ramp. 

“When it’s completely on, raise 
the ramp,” Docchi whispered to 
Jordan in an even lower voice. 

One geepcc wavered and fell. 
Motionless, it lay there. The re- 
maining four were barely equal 
to the task. 

“Now,” said Docchi. 

The freight ramp began to rise. 
The tank picked up speed as it 
rolled into the ship. 

“Geepees, save yourselves!” 
shouted Docchi. 

They leaped from the ramp. 

Jordan breathed deeply. “I 
don’t think they can hurt us 
now.” 

Docchi nodded. “Get me ship- 
to - asteroid communication, if 
there’s any radio left.” 

“There is.” Jordan made the 
adjustment. 

“Vogel, we’re going out. Give 
us the proper sequence and save 
the dome some damage.” 

There was no reply. 

“He’s trying to bluff,” said Jor- 
dan. “He knows the airlocks to 
the main dome will automatically 
close if we do break through.” 

“Sure," said Docchi. “Everyone 
in the main dome is safe, it every- 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



©nc is in there. Vogel, we’ll give 
you time to think about that.” 
Jordan gave him the time until 
it hurt, waiting. Meanwhile he 
flipped on the telecom and search- 
ed the rocket dome. Nothing was 
moving; no geepee was in sight. 
Docchi watched the screen with 
interest. What he thought didn’t 
show on his face. 

Still there was no reply from 
Vogel. 

“All right,” Docchi said in a 
low, hard voice. “Jordan, take it 
out. Hit the shell with the bow 
of the rocket.” 

The ship hardly quivered as it 
ripped through the transparent 
covering of the rocket dome. The 
worst sound was unheard: the 
hiss of air escaping through the 
great hole in the envelope. 

Jordan sat at the controls, 
gripping the levers. “I couldn’t 
tell,” he said slowly. “It happened 
too fast for me to be sure. Maybe 
Vogel did have the inner shell out 
of the way. In that event, it’s all 
right because it would close im- 
mediately. The outer shell is sup- 
posed to be self-sealing, but I 
doubt if it could handle that 
much damage.” 

He twisted the lever and the 
ship leaped forward. 

“Cameron I don't mind. He had 
enough time to get out if he 
wanted to. But I keep thinking 
that Nona might be in there.” 
Docchi avoided his eyes. There 



was no light at all in his face. H- 
walked away. 

Jordan rocked back and fortl 
The hemisphere that held wh; 
remained of his body was w< 
suited for that. He set the autc 
controls and reduced the gravit 
to one-quarter Earth normal. 1 
bent his great arms and shovt 
himself into the air, deftly catcl

was just below his shoulder.

dangled from one hand. “We ha\

Docchi stiffened. “Who?’* 

“I could describe her,” sai> 
Jordan. “But why, when a nam

will do at least as well?** 

“Nona!’' said Docchi. He 
slumped in sudden relief against 
the wall. “How did she get in the 
ship?" 

■ “A good question," said Jor- 
dan. "Remind me to ask her that 
sometime when she's able to an- 
swer. But since 1 don’t know, I’ll 
have to use my imagination. My 
guess is that, after she jammed 
the lights and scanners in the 
rocket dome, she walked to the 
ship and tapped the passenger 
lock three times in the right 
places, or something just as im- 
probable. The lock opened for her 
whether it was supposed to or 
not.” 

“As good a guess as any,” 
agreed Docchi. 

may as well make our as- 
sumptions complete. Once inside, 
she felt tired. She found a com- 
fortable cabin and fell asleep in 
it. She remained asleep through- 
out our skirmish with the gee- 
pees.’* 

“She deserves a rest,’' said Doc- 
ehi. 

“She does. But if she had wait- 
ed a few minutes to take it. she'd 
have saved you the trouble of 
crawling through the tubes.” 

“She did her part and more,” 
Docchi argued. “We depend too 
much on her. Next we’ll expect 
her to escort us personally to the 
stars.” He straightened up. “Let’s 
go. Anti is waiting for us.” 



The cargo hold was sizable. It 
had to be to contain the tank, 
battered and twisted though it 
was. Equipment had been jarred 
from storage racks and lay in 
tangled heaps on the floor. 

“Anti !” called Docchi. 

“Here." 

“Are you hurt?” 

“Never felt a thing,” came the 
cheerful reply. 

J ORDAN scaled the side of the 
tank. He reached the top and 
peered over. “She seems all 
right," he called down. “Part of 
the acid’s gone. Otherwise no 
damage.” 

Damage enough, however. Acid 
was a matter.,of life for Anti. It 
had been splashed from the tank 
and, where it had spilled, metal 
was corroding rapidly. The wall 
against which the tank had crash- 
ed was bent and partly eaten 
through. That was no reason for 
alarm: the scavenging system of 
the ship would handle acid. The 
real question was what to do for 
Anti. 

‘T’ve stewed in this soup for 
years,” said Anti. “Get me out of 
here.” 

“How?” 

“If you weren’t as stupid as 
doctors pretend to be. you’d know 
how. No gravity, of course. I’ve 
got muscles, more than you think. 
I can walk as long as my bones 
don’t break from the weight.” 



U 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



No gravity would be rough on 
Docchi; having no arms, he would 
be virtually helpless. The pros- 
pect of floating free without being 
able to grasp something was ter- 
rifying. 

*'As soon as we can manage it," 
he said, forcing down his fear. 
^‘First we’ve got to drain and 
store the acid.” 

Jordan had anticipated that. 
He’d swung ofl* the tank and was 
busy expelling the water from an 
auxiliary compartment into space. 
As soon as the compartment was 
empty, he led a hose from it to 
the tank. 

The pumps sucked and the acid 
level fell slowly, 

Docchi felt the ship lurch fa- 
miliarly. "Hurry,” he called out 
to Jordan. 

The gravital unit was acting 
up. Presumably it was getting 
ready to cut out. If it did — well, 
a free-floating globe of acid would 
be as destructive to the ship and 
those in it as a high velocity 
meteor cluster. 

Jordan jammed the lever as far 
as it would go and held it there. 
“All out,” said Jordan presently, 
and let the hose roll back into 
the Wall. Done in plenty of time. 
The gravital unit remained in 
operation for a full minute. 

As soon as she was weightless. 
Anti rose out of the tank. 

In all the time Docchi had 
known her, he bad seen no more 



than a face framed in blue acid. 
Periodic surgery, where it was 
necessary, had trimmed the flesh 
from her face. For the rest, she 
lived submerged in a corrosive 
liquid that destroyed the wild 
tissue as fast as it grew. Or nearly 
as fast. 

Docchi averted his eyes. 

“Well, junkman, look at a real 
monster,” snapped Anti. 

TTUMANS were not meant to 
grow that large. But it was 
not obscene to Docchi, merely un- 
believable. Jupiter is not repulsive 
because it is the bulging giant of 
planets; it is overwhelming, and 
so was Anti. 

“How will you live out of the 
acid?” he stammered. 

“How really unobservant some 
men are,” said Anti loftily. “I an- 
ticipated our little journey and 
prepared for it. If you look close- 
ly, you will notice I have on a 
special surgery robe. It’s the only 
thing in the Solar System that 
will fit me. It’s fabricated from a 
spongelike substance and holds 
enough acid to last me about 
thirty-six hours.” 

She grasped a rail and propelled 
herself toward the corridor. Nor- 
mally that was a spacious pas- 
sageway. For her it was a close 
fit. 

Satellites, one glowing and the 
other swinging in an eccentric 
orbit, followed after her. 



accidental rUGHT

N ona was standing before tbe 
instrument panel when they 
came back. There was an impres- 
sive array of dials, lights and lev- 
ers in front of her, but she wasn’t 
interested in these. A single 
small dial, separate from the rest, 
held her complete attention. She 
seemed disturbed by what she 
saw or didn’t see. Disturbed or 
excited, it was difficult to say 
which. 

Anti stopped. “Look at her. If 
I didn’t know she’s a freak like 
the rest of us, the only one, in 
fact, who was born that way, it 
would be easy to hate her-'-she’s 
so disgustingly normal.” 

•Normal? True and yet not true. 
Surgical techniques that could 
take a body apart and put it back 
together again with a skill once 
reser^d for the repair of ma- 
chines had made beauty com- 
monplace. No more sagging mus- 
cles. wrinkles; even the aged were 
attractive and youthful - seeming 
until the day they died. No more 
ill-formed limbs, misshapen bod- 
ies. Everyone was handsome or 
beautiful. No exceptions. 

None to speak of, at least. 

The accidentals didn’t bglong, 
®f course. In another day most of 
them would have been candidates 
for a waxworks or the formalde- 
hyde of a specimen bottle. 

Nona fitted neither category: 
she wasn’t a repair job. Looking 
at her closely- — and why not? — 

U 



^e was an original work as far 
from the normal in one direction 
as Anti, for example, was in the 
©ttier, 

“Why is she staring at the little 
dial?” asked Anti as the others 
slipped past her and came into 
the compartment. “Is there some- 
thing wrong ^ith it?” She 
shrugged. “I would be interested 
in the big dials. The ones with 
colored lights.” 

“That’s Nona.” Docchi smiled. 
“I’m sure she’s never been in the 
control room of a rocket before, 
and yet she went straight to the 
most curious thing in it. She’s 
looking at the gravital indicator. 
Directly behind it is the gravital 
unit.” 

“How do you know? Does it 
say so?” 

“It doesn’t. You have to be 
trained to recognize it, or else be 
Nona.” 

Anti dismissed that intellectual 
feat. “What are you waiting for? 
You know she can’t hear us. Go 
stand in front of her.” 

“How do I get there?” Docchi 
had risen a few inches from the 
floor, now that Jordan had re- 
leased him from his grip. 

“A good engineer would have 
enough sense to put on magne- 
slippers. Nona did.” Anti grasped 
his jacket. How she was able to 
move was uncertain. The tissues 
that surrounded the woman were 
too vast to permit the perception 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



©f individual motions. Neverthe- 
less, she proceeded to the center 
of the compartment, and with 
her came Docchi. 

Nona turned before they 
reached her. 

"My poor boy,” sighed Anti. 
“You do a very bad job of con- 
cealing your emotions, if that’s 
what you’re trying to do. Any- • 
way, stop glowing like a rainbow 
and say something.” 

“Hello,” said Docchi. 

Nona smiled at him, though it 
was Anti that she came to. 

“No, not too close, child. Don’t 
touch the surgery robe unless you 
want your pretty face to peel off 
like a plastiwrapper.” 

Nona stopped; she said nothing. 

Anti shook her head hope- 
lessly. “I wish you would learn 
to read lips or at least recognize 
written words. It’s so difficult to 
communicate with you.” 

“She knows facial expressions 
and actions, 1 think,” said 
Docchi. “She’s good at emotions. 
Words are a foreign concept to 
her.” 

“What other concepts does 
anyone think with?” asked Anti 
dubiously- 

“Maybe mathematical rela- 
tionships,” answered Docchi. 
“Though she doesn’t. They’ve 
tested her for that.” He frowned. 
“I don’t know what concepts she 
does think with. I wish I did.” 

“Save some of that worry and 



apply it to our present situation,** 
said Anti. "The object of your 
concern doesn’t seem to be inter* 
csted in it.” 

That was true. Nona had wan- 
dered back and was staring at 
the gravital indicator again. 
What she- saw to hold her atten- 
tion was a puzzle. 

In some ways she seemed irre- 
sponsible and childlike. That wa* 
an elusive thought, though : 
whose child? Not really, of course. 
Her parents were obscure tech- 
nicians and mechanics, descend- 
ants of a long line of mechanics 
and technicians. The question he 
had asked himself was this: 
where and how does she belong? 
He couldn’t answer. 

With an effort Docchi 'came 
back to reality. “We appealed to 
the Medicouncil,” he said. “We 
asked for a ship to go to the 
nearest star. It would have to be 
a rocket, naturally. Even allow- 
ing for a better design than any 
we now have, the journey would 
take a long time, forty or fifty 
years going and the same length 
of time back. That’s entirely too 
long for a normal, but it wouldn’t 
matter to a biocompensator.” 

“Why a rocket?” interrupted 
Jordan. “Why not some form of 
gravity drive?” 

“An attractive idea,” admitted 
Docchi. “Theoretically, there’s no 
limit to gravity drive except 
light speed, and even that’s not

certain. If it would work, the 
time clement could be cut to a 
fraction. But the last twenty 
years have proved that gravity 
drives won’t work at all outside 
the Solar System. They function 
very poorly even when the ship 
is as far out as Jupiter’s orbit.” 

“I thought the gravity drive on 
a sh V was nearly the same as the 
gravital unit on the asteroid,’* 
said Jordan. “Why won’t they 
function?” 

“I don’t know why,” answered 
Docchi impatiently. “If I did, I 
wouldn’t be marooned on Handi- 
cap Haven. Arms or no arms, 
biocompensator or not, I’d be the 
most important scientist on 
Earth.” 

“W^h a multitude of pretty 
women competing for your affec- 
tions,” added Anti. 

“I think he’d settle for one. A 
certain one,” suggested Jordan. 

“Poor, unimaginative boy,” 
said Anti. “In my youth . .” 

“We’ve heard about your 
youth,” said Jordan. 

“Youth and love are long since 
past for both of you. Talk about 
them privately if you want, but 
not now.” Docchi glowered at 
them. “Anyway,” he resumed, 
“gravity drive is out. One time 
they had hopes for it, but no 
longer. It should be able to drive 
this ship. Actually, its sole func- 
tion is to provide an artificial 
gravity inside the ship, for pas- 



senger comfort. So rocket ship it 
is. That’s what we asked for. The 
Mcdicouncil refused. Therefore 
we’re going to appeal to a higher 
authority.” 

“Fine,” said Anti. “How?” 
“We’ve discussed it,” answered 
Docchi. “Ultimately the Medi- 
council is responsible to the Solar 
Government. And in turn — ” 

“All right, I’m in favor of it,** 
said Anti. “I just wanted to 
know.” 

“Mars is closer,” continued 
Docchi. “But Earth is the seat 
of government. As soon as we get 
there . He stopped suddenly 
and listened. 

Anti listened with him and 
waited until she could stand it 
no longer. “What's the matter?” 
she asked. “I don’t hear any^ 
thing.” 

Jordan leaned forward in his 
seat and looked at the instrument ^ 
panel. “That’s the trouble, Anti. 
You’re not supposed to hear any- 
thing. But you should be able to 
feel the vibration from the rocket 
exhaust, as long as it’s on.” 

“I don’t feel ans^hing, either.” 
“Yeah,” said Jordan. He looked 
at Docchi. “There’s plenty of 
fuel.” 

l^OMENTUM of the ship 
didn’t cease when the rock- 
ets stopped, of course. They were 
still moving, but not very fast 
and not in the direction they 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wanted to go. Gingerly Docchi 
tried out the magneslippers; he 
was clumsy, but no longer help- 
less in the gravityless ship. He 
stared futilely at the instruments 
as if he could wring more secrets 
than the panel had electronic ac- 
cess to. 

“It’s mechanical trouble of 
some sort,” he said uneasily. 
“There’s one way of finding out.” 
Before he could move, Anti 
was in the corridor that led away 
from the control compartment. 

“Stay here, Anti,” he said. “I’ll 
see what’s wrong.” 

She reached nearly from the 
floor to the ceiling. She missed 
by scant inches the sides of the 
passageway. Locomotion was 
easy enough for her; turning 
around wasn’t. Anti didn’t turn. 

“Look, honey,” her voice floated 
back. “You brought me along for 
the ride. That’s fine, but I’m not 
satisfied with it. I want to earn 
my fare. You stay and run the 
ship because you know how and 
I don’t. I’ll find out what’s 
wrong.” 

“But you won’t know what to 
do. Anti.” There was no answer. 
“All right,” he said in defeat. 
“Both of us ought to go. Jordan, 
you stay at the controls.” 

Anti led the way because 
Docchi couldn’t get around her. 
Determinedly he shuffled along. 
There was a trick to magneslip- 
pers that he had nearly forgot- 



ten. Slowly it was coming back 
to him — shuffle instead of strid- 
ing. 

It was a dingy, poorly lighted 
passageway in an older ship. 
Handicap Haven definitely didn’t 
rate the best equipment that was 
produced. On one side was the 
hull of the ship; on the other, 
a few small cabins. None were 
occupied. Anti stopped. The pas- 
sageway ended in a cross corridor 
that led to the other side of the 
ship, 

“We’d better check the stern 
rocket tubes,” he said, still un- 
able to see around her. “Open it 
up and we’ll take a look.” 

“I can’t,” said Anti. “There 
are handles, but the thing won’t 
open. *There’s a red light, too. 
Does that mean anything?” 

His heart sank. “It does. Don’t 
try to open it. With your strength, 
you might be unlucky enough to 
do it.” 

“That’s a man for you.” said 
Anti sharply. “First he wants me 
to open it, and then he tells me 
not to.” 

“There’s a vacuum in there. 
The combustion cap has been re- 
tracted. That’s the only thing 
that will actuate the warning sig- 
nal. You’d die in a few seconds if 
you somehow managed to open 
the lock to the rocket compart- 
ment.” 

“What are wc waiting for? 
Let’s get busy and fix it.” 



ACCIDINTAL PlIAHT 



II 



“Sure, fix it. You sec, Anti,‘ 
that didn’t happen by itself. 
Someone, or something, was se- 
•ponsible.” 

“Who?” 

“Did you see anyone when we 
were loading your tank in the 
•hip?” 

“Nothing. I heard Cameron 
shouting, a lot of noise. All I 
could sec was what was directly 
overhead. What does that have to 
do with it?” 

“I think it has to do with a 
geepee. I thought they all 
dropped outside. Maybe there 
was one that didn’t.” 

“Why a geepee?” she asked 
blankly. 

- “In the first place, no man is 
strong enough to move the com- 
bustidh cap. But if he should 
somehow manage to exert super- 
human effort, as soon as the cap 
cleared the tubes, rocket action 
would cease. The air in the com- 
partment would exhaust into 
space and anyone in there would 
die.” 

“So wc have a dead geepee in 
there.” 

“A geepee doesn’t die. Not 
even become inactive: it doesn’t 
need air.” Docchi tried to think 
the tiling through. “Not only 
that, a geepee might be able to 
esc: ; from the compartment. 
The I.:ck would close as soon as 
the pressure dropped. But a 
geepee • . 



Anti settled down grimly. 
“Then there’s a- geepee on the 
loose, intent on sabotage?” 

“I’m afraid so/’ he admitted 
worriedly. 

“What are we standing here 
for? We’ll' go: back to controls 
and pick up the robot on radio. 
What it damaged, it can repair.” 
She was partly turned around 
now and saw Docchi’s face. 
“Don’t tell me,” she said. “I sup- 
pose I should have thought of it. 
The signal doesn’t work inside 
the ship.” 

Docchi nodded. “It doesn’t. 
Robots are never used aboard, so 
the control is set in the bow an- 
tenna and the ship, of course, is 
insulated.” 

“Well,” said Anti happily, 
“we’ve got a robot hunt ahead 
of us.” 

“We do. And our bare hands 
to hunt it with.” 

“Oh, come now! It’s not as 
bad as all that. Look, the geepee 
was back here when the rockets 
stopped. Could it get by the con- 
trol compartment without our 
seeing it?” 

“It couldn’t. There are two cor- 
ridors leading through the com- 
partment, one on each side of 
the ship.” 

“That’s what I thought. We 
came down one corridor and no 
geepee was in it. It has to be in 
the other. If it goes into a cabin, 
a light will shine on the outside. 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It can*t really hide from us.** 
“Sure, well find out where it 
ia. But what are we going to do 
with it when we find it?"' 

“I was thinking," said Anti. 
“Can you get around me when 
I’m standing like this?” 

“I can't." 

“Neither can a geepee. All I 
need is a toaster, or something 
that looks like one, and I can 
drive the robot into the control 
compartment for Jordan to pick 
off." Determinedly, she began to 
move toward the opposite cor- 
ridor. “Hurry back to Jordan and 
tell him what we’re doing. There 
ought to be another toaster on 
the ship. Probably there’s one 
somewhere in the control com- 
partment. Bring it back to me.” 
Docchi bit his lip and stared at 
the back of the huge woman. “All 
right,’' he answered. “But stay 
where you are. Don’t try any- 
thing until I get back.” 

Anti laughed. “I value my big, 
fat life," she said. There were 
other things she valued, but she 
didn’t mention them. 

Docchi went as fast as the 
magneslippers would allow, which 
wasn’t very fast. The strategy 
was simple, but it didn’t follow 
that it was sound — a toaster for 
Jordan and one for Anti, if an- 
other could be found. 

Anti would block the corridor. 
A geepee might go through her, 
but it could never squeeze past 



her. The robot would have to 
run for it. If it came toward Anti, 
she might be able to burn it down* 
But she would be firing directly 
into the control room. If She 
missed even partially — 

The instruments were delicate. 

It wasn’t better if Jordan got 
the chance to bring down the ro- 
bot. Anti would be in the line of 
fire. No, that wasn’t good, either. 
They’d have to think of some- 
thing else. 

“Jordan," called Docchi as he 
entered the control compartment. 
Jordan wasn’t there. Nona was, 
still gazing serenely at the grav- 
ity indicator. 

Lights were streaming from the 
corridor on the opposite side of 
the compartment. Docchi hurried 
over. Jordan was just inside the 
entrance, the toaster clutched 
grimly in his hand. He was hitch- 
ing his truncated body slowly 
toward the stem. 

Coming to meet him was Anti- 
unarmed, enormously fat Anti. 
She wasn’t walking: somehow it 
seemed more like swimming, a 
bulbous, flabby sea animal mov- 
ing through the air. She waved 
her fins against the wall and pro- 
pelled herself forward. 

“Melt him down!” she cried. 

It was difficult to make out the 
vaguely human form of the gee- 
pee. The powerful, shining body 
blended into the structure of the 
ship itself — unintentional camou- 



ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT

f!age, though the robot wasn’t 
aware of that. It was crouched 
at the threshold of a cabin, hesi- 
tating between the approaching 
dangers. 

Jordan raised the weapon and 
as instantly lowered it. “Get out 
of the way,” he told Anti. 

There was no place for her 
to go. She was too big to enter 
a cabin, too massive to let the 
gcepee squeeze by her even if 
she wanted it to. 

“Never mind that. Get him,” 
she answered, 

A geepee was not a genius even 
by robot standards. It didn’t need 
to be. Heat is deadly; a human 
body is a fragile thing. This it 
Icnew. It ran toward Anti. Unlike 
man. it didn't need magneslip- 
pers. Tt had magnetic metal feet 
which could move fast, and did. 

Docchi couldn’t close his eyes, 
though he wanted to. He had to 
watch. The geepee torpedoed into 
Anti. And it was the robot that 
was thrown back. Relative mass 
favored the monstrous woman. 

The electronic brain obeyed its 
original instructions, whatever 
those were. It got to its feet and 
rushed toward Anti. Metal arms 
shot out with dazzling speed and 
crashed against the flesh of the 
fat woman. Docchi could hear 
the thud. No ordinary person 
could take that kind of punish- 
ment and live. 

Anli wasn’t ordinary; she was 



strange, even for an accidental, 
living far inside a deep armor 
of flesh. It was possible that she 
never felt the crushing force of 
those blows. Amazingly, she 
grasped the robot and drew it 
to her. And the geepee lost the 
advantage of leverage. The bright 
arms didn’t flash so fast nor with 
such lethal power. 

“Gravity!” cried Anti. “All 
you’ve got!” 

She leaned against the strug- 
gling machine. 

Gravity. That was something 
he could do. Docchi turned, took 
two steps before the surge of 
gravity hit him. It came in waves, 
the sequence of which he was 
never able to disentangle. The 
first wave staggered him; at the 
second his knees buckled and he 
sank to the floor. After that his 
eardrums hurt. He thought he 
could feel the ship quiver. He 
knew dazedly that an artificial 
gravity field of this magnitude 
was impossible, but that knowl- 
edge didn’t help him move. 

It vanished as suddenly as it 
had come. Painfully his lungs ex- 
panded. Each muscle ached. He 
rolled to his feet and lurched past 
Jordan. 

He didn’t find the mass of 
broken flesh he expected. Anti 
was already standing. 

“Oof!” she grunted and gazed 
with satisfaction at the twisted 
grotesque shape at her feet.

ACCIDENTAL PLIGHT

The electronic brain had been 
smashed, the body flattened. 

“Are you hurt?” asked Docchi 
gently, awed. 

She waggled the extremities of 
her body. “Nope, I can’t feel any- 
thing broken,” she said solemnly. 
She moved back to get a better 
view of the robot. “I’d call that 
throwing my weight around. At 
the right time, of course. The 
secret’s timing. And I must say 
you picked up your cue with the 
gravity well.” Her laughter rolled 
through the ship. 

“It wasn’t I.” said Docchi. 

“Jordan? No, he’s just getting 
up. Then who?” 

“Nona,” said Docchi. “It had 
to be her. She saw what had to 
be dbne and did it. But how she 
got that amount of gravity — 

“Ask her,” said Anti with fond 
irony. 

Docchi grimaced and limped 
back into the control room, fol- 
lowed by Anti and Jordan. Nona 
was at the gravity panel, her face 
pleasant and childlike. 

“Gravity can be turned on or 
off,” said Docchi puzzedly, 
searching her face for some sign. 
“And regulated, within certain 
narrow limits. But somehow you 
doubled or tripled the normal 
amount. How?” 

Nona smiled questioningly. 

“Gravity engineers would like 
to know that too,” said Jordan. 

“Everybody would like to 



know," Anti interrupted irritably, 
“Except me. I’m too pragmatic, I 
suppose, but I want to know 
when we start the rockets and b« 
on our way." 

“It ten’t that easy," sighed 
Jordan. “A retracted combustion 
cap in flight generally means aft 
least one burned-out tube." He 
made his way to the instrument 
panel and looked at it glumly, 
“Three." 

“A factor." Docchi nodded. 
“But I was thinking about the 
robot." 

Anti was impatient. “An inter- 
esting subject, no doubt. What 
about it?” 

“Where did it get mstructiona? 
Not radio; the hull of the ship 
cuts off all radiation. The last we 
knew, it was in our control." 

“All right, how?" 

“Voice," said Docchi. “Can»- 
eron’s voice, to be exact." 

“But he was ia. the rocket 
dome,” Jordan objected. 

“Think back to when we were 
loading the tank. We had to look 
through the telecom and the angle 
of vision was bad. We couldn't 
see much of the cargo lock. Anti 
couldn’t see anything that wasnl 
directly overhead. Both Cameron 
and the geepee managed to get 
inside and we didn’t know it." 

Jordan hefted his weapon. 
“Looks like we’ve got another 
hunt on our hands. This time e 
nice normal doctor."

"Keep it handy," said Docchi» 
glancing at the toaster. "But be 
careful how you use it. One homi- 
cide and we can forget what we 
came for. I think he’ll be ready 
to surrender. The ship’s tempor- 
arily disabled; he’ll consider that 
damage enough." 

J ORDAN found the doctor in 
the forward section of the 
ship. Cameron knew better than 
to argue with a toaster. In a mat- 
ter of minutes he was in the con- 
trol room. 

"Now that you’ve got me, what 
arc you going to do with me?” he 
asked. 

Docchi swiveled away from the 
instrument panel. ‘T don’t expect 
active cooperation, of course, but 
I like to think you’ll give your 
word not to hinder us hereafter." 

Cameron glared. "I promise 
nothing of the kind." 

"We can chain him to Anti." 
suggested Jordan. "That will 
keep him out of trouble.” 

"Like leading a poodle on a 
leash? Nope," said Anti indig- 
nantly. "A girl has to have some 
privacy.” 

“Don’t wince, Cameron," ob- 
jected Docchi. "She really was a 
girl once, an attractive one.” 

“We can put him in a space- 
suit and lock his hands behind 
his back,” said Jordan. "Some- 
thing like an ancient straitjacket." 
Cameron laughed. 



"No, that's inhuman," said 
Docchi. 

Jordan juggled the toaster. "I 
can weld with this. Let’s put him 
in a cabin and weld the door 
closed. We can cut a slot to shove 
food in. A very narrow slot." 

“Excellent. I think you have 
the solution. That is, unless Dr. 
Cameron will reconsider his de- 
cision." 

Cameron shrugged. "They’ll 
pick you up in a day or less any- 
way. I suppose I’m not comprom- 
ising myself by agreeing to your 
terms.” 

"Good.” 

"A doctor’s word is as good as 
his oath,” observed Anti, "Hippo- 
cratic or hypocritic.” 

“Now, Anti, don’t be cynical. 
Doctors have an economic sense 
as well as the next person,” said 
Docchi gravely. He turned to 
Cameron. “You see, after Anti 
grew too massive for her skeletal 
structure, doctors reasoned she’d 
be most comfortable in the ab- 
sence of gravity. That was in the 
early days, before successful ship 
gravital units were developed. 
They put her on an interplane- 
tary ship and kept transferring her 
before each landing. 

"But that grew troublesome 
and — expensive. They devised a 
new treatment; the asteroid and 
the tank of acid. Not being 
aquatic by nature. Anti resented 
the change. She still does." 



ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT

*'I knew nothing about that,** 
Cameron pointed out defensively. 

“It was before your time.’* 
Docchi frowned at the doctor. 
“Tell me, why did you laugh 
when Jordan mentioned a space- 
suit?” 

Cameron grinned. "That was 
my project while you were busy 
with the robot.” 

“To do what? Jordan — ” 

But Jordan was already on his 
way. He was gone for some time. 

“Well?” asked Docchi on his 
return. It really wasn’t necessary; 
Jordan’s gloomy face told the 
Story. 

“Cut to Gibbons.” 

“All of them?” 

“Every^one. Beyond repair.” 
“VJhat’s the excitement about?” 
rumbled Anti. “We don’t need 
spacesuits unless something hap- 
pens to the ship and we have to 
go outside.” 

“Exactly, Anti. How do you 
suppose we go about replacing- 
the defective tubes? From the 
outside, of course. By destroying 
the spacesuits, Cameron made 
sure we can’t.” 

Anti opened her mouth with 
surprise and closed it in anger. 
She glowered at the doctor. 

“We’re still in the asteroid 
zone,” said Cameron. “In itself, 
that’s not dangerous. Without 
power to avoid stray rocks, it is. 
I advise you to contact the Medi- 
council. They’ll send a ship to 



pick us up and tow us in.” 

“No, thanks. I don’t like 
Handicap Haven as well as you 
do,” Anti said brusquely. She 
turned to Docchi. “Maybe I’m 
stupid for asking, but exactly 
what is it that’s deadly about be- 
ing out in space without a space- 
suit?” 

“Cold. Lack of air pressure. 
Lack of oxygen.” 

“Is that all? Nothing else?” 

His laugh was too loud. “Isn’t 
that enough?” 

“I wanted to be sure,” she said. 
She beckoned to Nona, who 
was standing near. Together they 
went forward, where the space- 
suits were kept. 

Cameron scowled puzzledly and 
started to follow. Jordan waved 
the toaster around. 

“All right,” said the doctor, 
stopping. He rubbed his chin. 
“What is she thinking about?” 
“I wouldn’t know,” said 
Docchi. “She’s not scientifically 
trained, if that’s what you mean. 
But she has a good mind, as 
good as her body once was.” 
“And how good was that?” 
“We don’t talk about it,” said 
Jordan shortly. 

¥T was a long time before the 
■- women came back — if the 
weird creature that floated into 
the control compartment with 
Nona was Anti. 

Cameron stared at her and saw 



M 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



shudderingly that it was. “You 
need a session with the psycho- 
computer,” he said. “When we 
get back, that’s the first thing we 
do. Can’t you understand . 

“Be quiet,” growled Jordan. 
“Now. Anti, explain what you’ve 
rigged up.” 

“Any kind of pressure is good 
enough as far as the outside of 
the body is concerned,” answered 
Anti, flipping back the helmet. 
“Mechanical pressure will do as 
well as air pressure. I had Nona 
cut the spacesuits into strips and 
wind them around me — ^hard. 
Then I found a helmet that would 
fit over my head when the dam- 
aged part was cut away. It won’t 
hold much air pressure, even 
taped very tight to my skin. But 
as long as it’s pure oxygen — ” 

“It might be satisfactory,” ad- 
mitted Docchi. “But the temper- 
ature?” 

“Do you think' I’m going to 
worry about cold?” asked Anti. 
“Me? Way down below all this 
flesh?” 

“Listen to me,” said Cameron 
through his teeth. “You’ve al- 
ready seriously threatened my 
career with all this childish non- 
sense. I won’t permit you to ruin 
it altogether • by a deliberate 
suicide.” 

“You and your stinking career,” 
retorted Jordan tiredly. “We’re 
not asking your permission to do 
anything.” He turned away from 



the doctor. “You understand the 
risk. Anti? It’s possible that it 
won’t work at all.” 

“I’ve thought about it,” Anti 
replied soberly. “On the other 
hand. I’ve thought about the as- 
teroid.” 

“All right,” said Jordan. 
Docchi nodded. Nona bobbed her 
head; it was doubtful that she 
knew what she was agreeing to. 

“Let’s have some telecom 
viewers outside,” said Docchi. 
“One directly in back, one on 
each side. We've got to know 
what’s happening.” 

Jordan went to the control 
panel and flipped levers. “They’re 
out and working,” he said, gazing 
at the screen. “Now, Anti, go to 
the freight lock. Close your hel- 
met and wait. I’ll let the air out 
slowly. The pressure change will 
be gradual. If anything seems 
wrong, let me know over the hel- 
met radio and I’ll yank you in 
immediately. Once you’re outside 
I’ll give you further instructions. 
Tools and equipment are in a 
compartment that, opens into 
space.” 

Anti waddled away, 

Jordan looked down at his leg- 
less body. “I suppose we have to 
be realistic about it — ” 

“We do,” answered Docchi. 
“Anti is the only one of us who 
has a chance of doing the job and 
surviving.” 

Jordan adjusted a dial. “It v£a«

Cameron who was responsible for 
it. If Anti doesn’t come back, you 
can be damn sure he’ll join her.” 
“No threats, please,” said 
Docchi. “When are you going to 
let her out?” 

“She’s out,” said Jordan. De- 
liberately, he had diverted their 
attention while he had taken the 
burden of emotional strain. 

Docchi glanced hastily at the 
telecom. Anti was hanging free in 
space, wrapped and strapped in 
strips torn from the useless space- 
suits — that, and more flesh than 
any human had ever borne. The 
helmet sat jauntily on her head; 
the oxygen cylinder was strapped 
to her back. She was still intact. 

“How is she?” he asked anx- 
iously unaware that the micro- 
phone was open. 

“Fine,” came Anti’s reply, faint 
and ready. “The air’s thin, but 
it’s pure oxygen.” 

“Cold?” asked Docchi. 

“It hasn’t penetrated yet. No 
worse than the acid, at any rate. 
What do I do?” 

Jordan gave her directions. The 
others watched. It was work to 
find the tools and examine the 
tubes for defectives, to loosen the 
tubes in the sockets and pull 
them out and push them spinning 
into space. It was still harder to 
replace them, though there was 
no gravity and Anti was held to 
the hull by^magneslippers. 

But it seemed more than work. 



To Cameron, who was watching, 
an odd thought occurred: In her 
remote past, of which he knew 
nothing, Anti had done something 
like this before. Ridiculous, of 
course. Yet there was a rhythm 
to her motions, this shapeless 
giant creature whose bones would 
break with her weight if she tried 
to stand at even only half Earth 
gravity. Rhythm, a sense of pur- 
pose, a strange pattern, an in- 
credible gargantuan grace. 

The whale plowing the waves 
is graceful; it cannot be other- 
wise in its natural habitat. The 
human race had produced, acci- 
dentally. one unlikely person to 
whom interplanetary space was 
not an alien thing. Anti was at 
last in her element. 

“Now,” said Jordan, keeping 
the tension out of his voice, “go 
back to the outside tool compart- 
ment. You’ll find a lever. PulL 
That will set the combustion cap 
in place,” 

“Done,” said Anti, some min- 
utes later. 

“That’s all. You can come in 
now.” 

“That’? all? But I’m not cold. 
It hasn’t reached any nerves 
yet.” 

“Come in,” repeated Jordan, 
showing the anger of alarm. 

She walked slowly over the hull 
tc the cargo lock and, while she 
did, Jordan reeled in the telecom 
viewers. The lock was no sooner 






40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



closed to the outside and the air 
hissing into the compartment 
than Jordan was there, opening 
tihe inner lock. 

“Are you all right?** he asked. 

She flipped back the helmet. 
There was frost on her eyebrows 
and her nose was a bright red. 
**Of course. My hands aren^t a 
bit cold.** She stripped off the 
heated gloves and waggled her 
fingers. 

“It can’f be!” protested Cam- 
eron. “You should be frozen 
stiff!” 

“Why?” asked Anti, laughing. 
“It’s a matter of insulation and 
I have plenty of that.” 

Cameron turned to Docchi. 
“When I was a kid. I saw a film 
of a dancer. She did a ballet, 
Life of the Cold Planets, I be- 
lieve it was called. For some 
cockeyed reason, I thought of it 
when Anti was out there. I hadn’t 
thought of it in years.” 

He rubbed his hand fretfully 
over his forehead. “It fascinated 
me when I first saw it. I couldn’t 
get it out of my mind. When I 
grew older, I found out a tragic 
thing happened to the dancer. 
She was on a tour of Venus and 
the ship she was in disappeared. 
They sent out searching parties, 
of course. They found her after 
she had spent a week on a fungus 
plain. You know what that 
meant. The great ballerina was a 
living spore culture medium,” 



“Shut up,” growled Jordan. 

Cameron didn’t seem to hear. 
“Naturally, she died. I can’t re- 
member her name, but Tve al- 
ways remembered the ballet she 
did. And that’s funny, because 
it reminded me of Anti out 
there — ” 

A fist exploded in his face. If 
there had been more behind the 
blow than shoulders and a frag> 
ment of a body; his jaw would 
have been broken. As it was he 
floated through the air and 
crashed against the wall. 

Angrily, he got to his feet. “I 
gave my word I wouldn’t cause 
any trouble. The agreement evi- 
dently doesn’t work both ways.” 
He glanced significantly at the 
weapon Jordan carried. “Maybe 
you’d better be sure to have that 
around at all times.” 

“I told you to shut up,” said 
Jordan. After that he ignored the 
doctor. He didn’t have a body 
with which to do it, but somehow 
Jordan managed a bow. “A flaw- 
less performance. One of your 
very best, Antoinette,” 

“Do you think so?” sighed 
Anti. The frost had melted from 
her eyebrows and was trickling 
down her cheek. She left with 
Jordan. 

Cameron remained behind. He 
felt his jaw. It was too bad about 
his ambitions. He knev now that 
he was never going to be the 
spectacular success he had once

imagined. Not after these acci- 
dentals had escaped from Handi- 
cap Haven. Still, he would always 
be able to practice medicine 
somewhere in the Solar System. 
He*d done his best on the asteroid 
and this ship, and he’d been a 
complete ass both times. 

The ballerina hadn’t really 
died, as he had been told. It 
would have been better for her 
if she had. He succeeded in re- 
calling her name. It had been 
Antoinette. 

Now it was Anti. He could have 
found that out by checking her 
case history — // Handicap Haven 
•d one on file. Probably not, 

! e comforted himself. Why keep 
case histories of hopeless cases? 

“TIE’LL stick to the regular 
lanes,” said Docchi, ‘‘I 
think we’ll get closer. They have 
no reason to suspect that we’re 
heading toward Earth. Mars is 
more logical, or one of the moons 
of Jupiter, or another asteroid.” 
Jordan shifted uneasily. ‘Tm 
not in favor of it. They’ll pick us 
up before we have a chance to 
say anything.” 

“But there’s nothing to dis- 
‘•nguiph us from an ordinary 
"'^rth-to-Mars t^ocket. We have 
rhip’s registry on boacd. Pick

munication is acting up. We can’t 
hear you. Traffic.* Don’t overdo 
the static effects but repeat that 
with suitable variations and I 
don’t think they will bother us." 

Shaking his head dubiously, 
Jordan swung away toward the 
repair ^ops. 

“You look worried," said Anti. 

Docchi turned around. “Yeah." 

“Won’t it work?" 

“Sure. We’ll get close to Earth. 
They’re not looking for us around 
here. They don’t really know why 
we escaped in the rocket. That’s 
why they can’t figure out where 
we’re going.” 

His face was taut and his eyes 
were tired. “It’s not that. The 
entire Solar Police Force has been 
alerted for us.” 

“Which means?” 

“Look. We planned to bypass 
the Medicouncil and take our 
case directly to the Solar Gov- 
ernment. If they want us as much 
as the radio indicates, it’s not 
likely they’ll be very sympathetic. 
If the Solar Government doesn’t 
support us all the way, we’ll 
never get another chance.” 

“Well?” said Anti. She seemed 
trimmer, more vigorous. “What 
are we waiting for? Let’s take the 
last step first.” 

He raised his head. “The Solar 
Government won’t like it.” 



42 



GALAXY SCIINCE FICTION 



••They won’t, but tiiere’s noth- 
ing they can do about it.” 

“I think there is — simply shoot 
ns down. When we stole the ship, 
we automatically stepped into 
the criminal class.” 

“We knew that in advance." 
“Is it worth it?” 

“I think so,” said Anti. 

“In that event,” he said, “I’ll 
need time to get ready.” 

She scrutinized him carefully. 
“Maybe we can fix you up.” 
“With fake arms and grease- 
paint? No. They’ll have to ac- 
cept us as we are." 

“A good idea. I hadn’t thought 
•f the sympathy angle.” 

“Not sympathy. Reality. I 
don’t want them to approve of us 
as handsome accidentals and 
have them change their minds 
when they discover what we’re 
really like.” 

Anti looked doubtful, but she 
kept her objections to herself as 
she waddled away. 

Sitting in silence, he watched 
her go. She, at least, would de- 
rive some benefit. Dr. Cameron 
apparently hadn’t noticed that 
exposure to extreme cold had 
done more to inhibit her unceas- 
ing growth than the acid bath. 
She’d never be normal again; that 
was obvious. But some day, if 
the cold treatment were properly 
investigated, she might be able 
to stand gravity. 

He examined the telecom. They 



were getting closer. No longer a 
bright point of light, Earth was 
a perceptible disc. He could sec 
the outline of oceans, shapes of 
land; he could Imagine people. 

Jordan came in. “The record 
is rigged up, though we haven’t 
had to use it. But we have a 
friend behind us. An official 
friend." 

“Has he blipped us?" 

“Not yet. He keeps hanging 
on.” 

“Is he overtaking us?” 

“He would like to.” 

“Don’t let him.” 

“With this bag of fiplts?" 

“Shake it apart if you have to," 
Docchi impatiently said. “How 
soon can you break into a broad- 
casting orbit?” 

“I thought that was our last 
resort.” 

“Right. As far as Anti and I 
are concerned, tins is it. Any 
argument against?” 

“None that I can think of,” 
answered Jordan. “With a heavy 
cruiser behind us, no argument 
at all.” 

^IpHEY were all in the control 
compartment. “I don’t want 
a focus exclusively on me,” 
Docchi was saying. “To a world 
of perfect normals I may look 
strange, but we have to avoid the 
family portrait effect.” 

“Samples," suggested Anti. 

“In a sense, yes. A lot depends

things more important than ap- 
pearance. Accomplishment, for 
example. Contributing to prog- 



ress in ways normals cannot do. 

“Shut away on Handicap 
Haven, we’re denied this right. 
All we can do there is exist in 
frustration and boredom, kept 
alive whether we want to Be or 
not. Yet we have a gigantic con- 
tribution to make ... if we arc

make the round trip; he would 
die of old age. But we accidentals 
can go! We would positively not 
die of old age! The Medicounci! 
knows that is true . and still 
will not allow us to go!” 

At the side of the control com- 
partment, Cameron opened his 
mouth to protest. Jordan, glanc- 
ing at him, imperceptibly wag- 
gled the concealed weapon. Cam- 
eron swallowed his words and 
subsided without a sound. 

*‘Biocompensation,” continued 
Docchi evenly. “You may know 
about it, but in case information 
on it has been suppressed, let me 
explain: The principle of bio- 
compensation has long been a 
matter of conjecture. This is the 
first age in which medical tcch- 
noldigy is advanced enough to 
explore it. Every cell, every or- 
ganism, tends to survive, as an 
individual, as a species. Injure 
it and it strives for survival ac- 
Arding to the seriousness of the 
injury. We accidentals have been 
maimed and mutilated almost 
past belief. 

“Our organisms had the assist- 
ance of medical science. Real 
medical science. Blood was sup- 
plied as long as we needed it, 
machines did all our breathing, 
kidneys were replaced, hearts fur- 
nished, glandular products sup- 
plied in the exact quantities 
necessary, nervous and muscular 
systems were regenerated. In the 



extremity of our organic struggle, 
because we had the proper treat- 
ment, our bodies were wiped vir- 
tually free of death.” 

Sweat ran down his face. He 
longed for hands to wipe it away. 

“Most accidentals are nearly 
immortal. Not quite — ^we’ll die 
four or five hundred years from 
now. Meanwhile, there is no rea- 
son why we can’t leave the Solar 
System. Rockets are slow; you 
would die before you got back 
from Alpha Centauri. We won’t. 
Time doesn’t matter to us. 

“Perhaps better, faster rockets 
will be devised after we leave. 
You may get to there long before 
we do. We won’t mind. We will 
simply have made our contribu- 
tion to progress as best we could, 
and that will satisfy us.” 

With an effort Docchi smiled. 
The instant he did, he felt it was 
a mistake, one that he couldn’t 
rectify. Even to himself it felt 
more like a snarl. 

“You know where we’re kept. 
That’s a politer word than im- 
prisoned. We don’t call it Handi- 
cap Haven ;^our name for it is the 
junkpile. And to ourselves we’re 
junkmen. Does this give you a 
clue to how we feel? 

“I don’t know what you’ll have 
to do to force the Medicouncil to 
grant their permission. We ap- 
peal to you as our last resort. We 
have tried all other ways and 
failed. Our future as human be-

ings is at stake. Whether we get 
what we want and need is some- 
thing for you to settle with your 
conscience.” 

He nudged the switch and sat 
down. 

His face was gray. 

*‘I don’t like to bother you,“ 
•aid Jordan, “but what shall we 
do about them?” 

Doccht glanced at the telecom. 
“They” were uncomfortably close 
and Considerably more numerous 
than the last time he had looked. 

‘‘Take evasive action,” he said 
wearily. “Swing close to Earth 
and use the planet’s gravity to 
give us a good push. We’ve got 
to keep out of their hands until 
people have time to react.” 

“I think you ought to know — ** 
began Cameron. There was an 
odd tone to his voice. 

“Save it for later,” said Docchl, 
“I’m going to sleep.” His body 
sagged. “Jordan, wake me up if 
anything imjjortant happens. 
And remember that you don’t 
have to listen to this fellow un- 
less you want to.” 

Jordan nodded and touched the 
controls. Nona, leaning against 
the gravital panel, paid no atten- 
tion to the scene. She seemed to 
be listening to something nobody 
else could hear. That was nothing 
new, but it broke Docchi’s heart 
whenever he saw it. His breath 
drew in almost with a sob as he 
left the control room. 



race went on. Backdropf 
planets, stars, darkness. The 
little flecks of light that edged 
nearer didn't seem cheerful to 
Jordan. His lips were fixed in a 
Straight, hard line. He could hear 
Docchi come in behind him. 

.“Nice speech,” said Cameron. 
“Yeah.” Docchi glanced at the 
telecom. The view didn’t inspire 
further comment. 

“That’s the trouble, it was just 
a speech. It didn’t do you any 
good. My advice is to give up 
bfbfore you get hurt.” 

“It would be.” 

Cameron stood at the thresh- 
old. “I may as well tell you,” 
he said reluctantly. “I tried to 
before the broadcast, as soon as 
I found out what you were going 
to do. But you wouldn’t listen.” 
He came into the control com- 
partment. Nona was huddled in a 
seat, motionless, expressionless. 
Anti was absent. 

“You know why the Medi- 
council -jefused to let you go?” 
“Sure,” said Docchi. 

“The general metabolism of 
accidentals is further from nor- 
mal than that of creatures we 
dredge from the bottom of the 
sea. Add to that an enormously 
elongated life span and you ought 
to see the Medicouncil’s objec- 
tion.” 

“Get to the point!” 

“Look at it this way.” Cam- 
eron continued almost desper- 



ACCIDENTAL FlIGHT 



47 



ately. “The Centauri group con- 
tains quite a few planets. From 
what we know of cosmology, in- 
telligent life probably exists there 
to a greater or lesser extent- You 
will be our representatives to 
them. What they look like isn’t 
important: it’s their concern. Bqt 
our ambassadors have to meet 
certain minimum standards. They 
at least — damn it, don’t you see 
that they at least have to look 
like human beings?’* 

“I know you feel that way,** 
taid Jordan, rigid with contempt#^ 

“I’m not talking for myself,’* 
Cameron said. “I’m a doctor. The 
medicouncilors are doctors. We 
graft on or regenerate legs and 
arms and eyes. We work with 
blood and bones and intestines. 
We know what a thin borderline 
separates normal people from— 
from you. 

“Don’t you understand? 
They’re perfect, perhaps too 
much so. They can’t tolerate even 
small blemishes. They rush to 
us with things like hangnails, 
pimples, simple dandruff. Health 
—or rather the appearance of it 
—has become a fetish. They may 
think they’re sympathetic to you, 
but what they actually feel is 
something else.” 

“What are you driving at?” 
whispered Docchi. 

“Just this: if it were up to the 
Medicouncil, you would be on 
your way to the Centauri group. 



But it isn’t. The decision always 
had to be referred back to the 
Solar System as a whole. And 
the Medicouncil can’t go counter 
to the mass of public opinion.” 

Docchi turned away in loath- 
ing. 

“Don’t believe me,” said Cam- 
eron. “You’re not too far from 
Earth. Pick up the reaction to 
your broadcast.” 

Worriedly, Jordan looked at 
Docchi. 

“We may as well find out,” said 
Docchi. “It’s settled now, one 
way or the other.’* 

They searched band after band. 
The reaction was always the 
same. Obscure private citizen or 
prominent one, man or woman, 
they all told how sorry they were 
for the accidentals, but — 

“Turn it off,” said Docchi at 
last. 

“Now what?” Jordan asked 
numbly. 

“You have no choice,” said the 
doctor. 

“No choice.” repeated Docchi 
dully. “No choice but to give iip. 
We misjudged who our allies 
were.** 

*‘We knew you had,” said Cam- 
eron. “It seemed better to let 
you go on thinking that way 
while you were on the asteroid. 
It gave you something to hope 
for. It made you feel you weren’t 
alone. The trouble was that you 
got farther than we thought you 



GALAXY 5CIE *CE FICTION 



would ever be able to.** 

“So we did,” Docchi said. His 
lethargy seemed to lift a little. 
“And there’s no reason to stop 
now. Jordan, pick up the ships 
behind us. Tell them we’ve got 
Cameron on board. A hostage. 
Play him up as a hero. Basically, 
he’s not with those who are 
against us.” 

Anti came into the con- 
trol compartment. Cheerfulness 
faded from her face. “What’s the 
matter?” she asked. 

“Jordan will explain to you. 
I’ve got to think.” 

Docchi closed his eyes. The 
ship lurched slightly, though the 
vibration from the rockets did 
not change. There was no reason 
for alarms the flight of a ship was 
never completely steady, Docchi 
paid no attention. 

At last he opened his eyes. “If 
we were properly fueled and pro- 
visioned,” he said without much 
hope, “I would be in favor of 
the four of us heading for Alpha 
or Proxima. Maybe even Sirius. 
It wouldn’t matter where, since 
we wouldn’t intend to come back. 
But we can’t make it with our 
small fuel reserve. If we can 
shake the ships behind us. we 
might be able to hide until we 
can steal the necessary fuel and 
food.” 

“What’ll we do with Doc?” 
asked Jordan. 

“We’d have to raid an un- 



guarded outpost, of course. Prob- 
ably a small mining asteroid. We 
can leave him there.” 

“Yeah,” said Jordan. “A good 
idea, if wc can run away from 
our personal escort of blood- 
hounds. Offhand, that doesn’t 
seem very likely. They didn’t 
come any closer when I told them 
we had Doc with us, but they 
didn’t drop back — ” 

He stopped and raised his eyes 
to the telecom. He blinked, not 
believing what he saw. 

“They’re gone!” His voice 
broke with excitement. 

Almost instantly Docchi was 
beside him. “No,” he corrected. 
“They’re still following, but 
they’re very far behind.” Even as 
be looked, the pursuing ships vis- 
ibly lost ground. 

“What’s our relative speed?” 
asked Jordon. He looked at the 
dials himself, frowned, tapped 
them as if the needles had gone 
crazy. 

“What did you do to the 
rockets?” demanded Docchi. 

“Nothing! There wasn’t a thing 
I could do. Wc were already run- 
ning at top speed.” 

“We’re above it. Way above it. 
How?” 

There was nothing to explain 
their astoni.shing velocity. Cam- 
eron, Anti, and Jordan were in 
the control compartment. Nona 
still sat huddled up, bands 
pressed tight against her h^ad. 



ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT 



49 



There was no explanation at all, 
yet power was pouring into the 
gravital unit, as a long unused, 
actually useless dial was indi- 
cating. 

"The gravital drive is work- 
ing,” Docchi blankly pointed out. 

"Nonsense,” said Anti. "I don’t 
feel any weight.” 

"You don’t,” answered Docchi. 
**You won’t. The gravital unit 
was originally installed to drive 
the ship. When that proved un- 
satisfactory, it was converted. 
The difference is slight but im- 
portant. An undirected general 
field produces weight effects in- 
side the ship. That’s for passenger 
comfort. A directed field, ou^dc 
the ship, will drive it. You can 
have one or the other, not both." 

"But I didn’t turn on the grav- 
jfal drive," said Jordan in fiat 
bewilderment. "I couldn’t if 1 
wanted to. It’s disconnected." 

"I would agree with you, ex* 
cept for one thing. It’s working." 
Docchi stared at Nona, whose 
eyes were closed. **Gct her at- 
tention," he said. 

It was Jordan who gently 
touched her shoulder. She opened 
her eyes. On the instrument 
board, the needle of a once use- 
less dial rose and fell. 

“What’s the matter with the 
poor dear?" asked Anti. “She’s 
shaking." 

I "Let her alone," said Docchi. 
I No one moved. No one said 



anything at all. Minutes passed 
while the ancient ship creaked 
and groaned and ran'-away from 
the fastest rockets in the Solar 
System. 

"I think I know,” said Docchi 
at last, still frowning. "Consider 
the gravity-generating plant. Part 
of it is an electronic computer, 
capable of making the necessary 
calculations and juggling the 
proportion of power required to 
produce, continuously, directed 
or undirected gravity. In other 
words, a brain, a complex me- 
chanical intelligence. From the 
viewpoint of that intelligence, 
why should it perform ad infini- 
tutrt a complicated but meaning- 
less routine? It didn’t know why, 
and because it didn’t, very sim- 
ply, it refused to do so. 

"Now consider Nona. She’s 
deaf, can’t speak, can't communi- 
cate. In a way she’s comparable 
to the gravital computer. Like it, 
rise has a very high potential 
intelligence. Like it, she’s had dif- 
ficulty grasping the facts of her 
environment. Unlike it, though, 
•he has learned something. How 
much, I don’t know, but it’s far 
more than the Mcdicouncil psy- 
chologists credit her with.” 

"Yeah,” said Jordan dubiously. 
"But what’s happening now?” 

"If there were two humans in- 
volved, you would call it te- 
lepathy," answered Docchi hesi- 
tantly, fumbling for concepts he 



• ALAXY SCIINCI FICTION 



could only sense without grasp- 
ing. “One intelligence is elec- 
tronic, the other organic. You’ll 
have to coin a new term, because 
the only one I know is extra- 
sensory perception, and that’s 
obviously ridiculous. It is, isn’t 
it?” 

Jordan smiled and flexed his 
arms. Under the shapeless gar- 
ment his muscles rippled. “It 
isn’t,” he said. “The power was 
there, but we’re the only ones 
who know how to use it. Or rather 
Nona is.” 

“Power?” repeated Anti, rising 
majestically. “You can keep it. 
I want just enough to get to 
Centauri.” 

“I think you’ll get it,” Docchi 
promised. “A lot of things seem 
clearer now. For example, in the 
past, why didn’t gravital units 
work well at considerable dis- 
tances from the Sun? As a matter 
of fact, the efficiency of each unit 
was inversely proportional to 
the square of the distance be- 
tween it and the Sun. 

-“The gravital computer is a 
deaf, blind, mass-sensitive brain. 
The major fact in its existence 
is the Sun, the greatest mass in 
the Solar System. To such a 
brain, leaving the Solar System 
would be like stepping off the 
edge of a flat world, because it 
couldn’t be aware of stars. 

“Now that it knows about the 
Galaxy, the drive will work any- 



where. With Nona to direct it, 
even Sirius isn’t far away.” 

“Doc,” said Jordan carelessly, 
“you’d better be figuring a way 
to get off the ship. Remember, 
we’re going faster than man ever 
went before.” He chuckled. “Un- 
less, of course, you like our com- 
pany and don’t want to leave.” 

“We’ve got to do some figuring 
ourselves,” interposed Docchi. 
“Such as where we are heading 
now.” 

“A good idea,” said Jordan. 
He busied himself with charts 
and calculations. Gradually his 
flying fingers slowed. His head 
bent low over his work. At last 
he stopped and folded his arms. 

“Where?” asked Docchi. 

“There.” Jordan dully punched 
the telecom selector and a view 
became fixed on the screen. In 
the center glimmered a tiny 
world, a fragment of a long-ex- 
ploded planet. Their destination 
was easily recognizable. 

It was Handicap Haven. 

“But why do we want to go 
there?” asked Anti. She looked in 
amazement at Docchi. 

“We’re not going voluntarily,” 
he answered, his voice flat and 
spent. “We’re going where the 
Medicouncil wants us to go. We 
forgot about the monitor system. 
When Nona activated the gravi- 
tal unit, that fact was indicated 
at some central station. All the 
Medicouncil had to do was use 

SI 



ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT 



the monitor to take the gravital 
drive away from Nona.” 

“We thought we were running 
away from the ships, which we 
were, but only to beat them back 
to the junkpile?” asked Anti. 

Docchi nodded. 

“Well, it’s over. We did our 
best. There’s no use crying about 
it ” Yet she was. She passed by 
Nona, patting her gently. “It’s 
all ri^ht, darling. You tried.” 

Jordan followed her from the 
compartment. 

Cameron remained; he came 
over to Docchi. “Ever3rthing isn’t 
lost,” he said, somewhat awk- 
wardly. “You’re back where you 
started from, but Nona at least 
will benefit.” 

“Benefit?” said Docchi. “Some- 
one ^ill. It won’t be Nona.” 

“You’re wrong. Now that she 
is an important factor — ” 

“So is a special experimental 
machine. Very valuable. I don’t 
think she’ll like that classifica- 
tion.” 

Silence met silence. It was Dr. 
Cameron who turned away. 

“That ghastly glow of yours 
when you’re angry always did 
upset me. I’ll come back when it’s 
dimmer.” 

Docchi glared after him. Cam- 
eron was the only normal aware 
that it was Nona ^ho controlled 
the gravital unit. All the outside 
world could realize was that it 
Was in operation, as it had been 



designed to work, but never had. 
If Cameron could be disposed 
of — 

He shook his head. It wouldn’t 
solve anything. He might fool 
them for a while. They might 
think he was responsible. In the 
end, they’d find out. Nona wasn’t 
capable of that much deception, 
for she never knew what a test 
was. 

He went over to her. Once he 
had hoped ... It didn’t matter 
what he had hoped. 

She looked up and smiled. She 
had a right to. No word had ever 
broken the silence of her mind, 
but now she was communicating 
with something, whatever it was 
that an electronic brain could 
say. Of course she didn’t under- 
stand that the conversation was 
taking place between two cap- 
tives, herself and the gravital 
computer. 

Abruptly he turned away. He 
stopped at the telecom panel and 
methodically lacked it apart. 
Delicate tubes smashed into pow- 
der. The emergency radio he 
thoroughly demolished. 

The ship was firmly in the 
grip of the gravital monitor. 
There was nothing he could do 
about that. All that remained was 
to protect Nona from their pry- 
ing minds as long as he could. 

She didn’t hear the noise, or 
didn’t care. She sat there, head 
in her hands, calnjj and smiling.

riiHE outer shell of the rocket 
dome opened before and 
closed behind them. Jordan set 
the controls in neutral and lifted 
his hands, muttering to himself. 
They were gliding through the lip 
of the inner shell. Home. 

“Cheer up,” said Cameron 
breezily. “You’re not really pris- 
oners, you know.” 

Nona seemed content, though 
Jordan didn’t. Docchi said j\oth- 
ing, the light gone from his face. 
Anti wasn't with them; she was 
floating in the tank of acid. The 
gravity field of the asteroid made 
that necessary. 

The ship scraped gently and 
they were down. Jordan touched 
a lever; passenger and freight 
locks were open. 

“Let’s go.” said Dr. Cameron. 
“I imagine there’s a reception 
committee for you.” 

There was. The little rocket 
dome held more ships than nor- 
mally came in a year. The precise 
confusion of military discipline 
was everywhere in evidence. Arm- 
ed guards lined either side of the 
landing ramp down which they 
walked. 

At the bottom, a large telecom 
unit had been set up. If size in- 
dicated anything, someone con- 
sidered this an important 
occasion. From the screen, larger 
than life, Medicouncilor Thorton 
looked out approvingly. 

The procession ' from the ship 

ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT 



halted in front of the telecom 
unit. 

“A good job, Dr. Cameron,** 
said the medicouncilor, “We were 
quite surprised at the escape of 
the four accidentals, and your 
disappearance, which coincided 
with it. From what we were able 
to piece together, you deliberately 
followed them. A splendid exam- 
ple of quick thinking. Doctor. 
You deserve recognition for it.** 
“Thank you,” said Cameron. 
“I’m sorry I can’t be there to 
congratulate you in person, but 
I will be soon.” The medicovnei- 
lor paused discreetly. “At first 
the publicity was bad. Very bad. 
We thought it unwise to conceal 
an affair of such magnitude. Of 
course the unauthorized broad- 
cast made it impossible. Fo-tun- 
ately, the gravital discovery came 
along at just the right time. I 
don’t mind telling you that the 
net effect is now in our favor.” 

“I hoped it would be,” said 
Cameron. “Nona — ” 

“You’ve spoken about her be- 
fore.” The medicouncilor frown- 
ed. “We can discuss her 1 '.ter. 
For the moment, see that sh" and 
the rest of the accidentals arc re- 
turned to their usual pl-ices. 
Bring Docchi to your office at 
once. I want to question him pri- 
vately.** 

Cameron stared at him i i bc- 
wiMerment. “But 1 thoug’^t — **

ped Thorton. “Important people 
are waiting for you. That is all.” 
The telecom darkened. 

“I think you heard what he 
said. Dr. Cameron.” The officer 
at his side was very polite. He 
could aiTord to be, with the rank 
of three big planets on his tunic. 

“Very well,” Cameron answer- 
ed. “But as commander of the as- 
teroid, I request that you furnish 
a guard for the girl.” 

“Commander?” repeated the 
officer. “That’s funny — my orders 
indicate that I am, until further 
notice. I haven’t got that notice.” 
He locked around at his men and 
crooked a finger. “Lieutenant, see 
that the little fellow — ^Jordan, I 
think his name is — gets a lift back 
to the main dome. And you can 
wall^the pretty lady to her room. 
Or whatever it is she lives in.” 
He smiled negligently at Camer- 
on. “Anything to oblige another 
commander.” 

ri^HE medicouncilor, Thorton, 
was waiting impatiently on 
the telecom when they got to 
Cameron’s office. 

“We will arrive in about two 
hours,” he said immediately. 
“When I say we, I mean a num- 
ber of top governmental officials 
and scientists. Meanwhile, let’s 
get on with this gravital busi- 
ness.” He caught sight of the 
commander. “General Judd, this 
is a technical matter. I don't 



think you’ll be interested in it.” 
“Very well, sir. I’ll stand guard 
outside.” 

The medicouncilor was silent 
until the door closed behind Gen- 
eral Judd. “Sit down, Docchi,” 
he said with unexpected kindness. 
He paused to note the effect. “I 
can sympathise with you. You 
had everything you wanted near- 
ly within your reach. And, after 
that, to return to Handicap Ha- 
ven — well, I can understand how 
you feel. But since you did return, 
I think we can arrange to do 
something for you.” 

Docchi stared at the man on 
the screen. A spot of light pulsed 
on his cheek and then flared rap- 
idly over his face. 

“Sure.” he said casually. “But 
there are criminal charges against 
me.” 

“A formality,” said the medi- 
councilor. “With a thing like the 
discovery — or rediscovery— of the 
gravital drive to think about, no 
one is going to worry much about 
your , unauthorized departure 
from the asteroid.” 

Medicouncilor Thorton sound- 
ed pleased. “I don’t want to mis- 
lead you. We can’t do any more 
for you medically than has al- 
ready been done. However, you 
will find yourself the center of a 
more adequate social life. Friends, 
work, whatever you want. Nat- 
urally, in return for this, we will 
expect your full cooperation.”

“Naturally.** Docchi blinked at 
him and got to his feet. “Sounds 
interesting. I’d like to think about 
it for a minute.” 

Cameron planted himself 
squarely in front of the screen. 
“Maybe f don’t understand. I 
think you’ve got the wrong per- 
son.” 

“Dr. Cameron !” Thorton glow- 
ered. “Please explain." 

“It was an easy mistake to 
make,” said Cameron. “Cut ofif 
from communication, the gravital 
drive began to work. How? Why? 
Mostly, who did it? You knew it 
wasn’t I. I’m a doctor, not a 
physicist. Nor Jordan, he’s at 
best a mechanic. Therefore it had 
to be Docchi, because he’s an en- 
gineer. He could make it work. 
But it wasn’t Docchi. He had 
nothing to do with — 

“Look out!” cried Thorton too 
late. 

Cameron fell to his knees. The 
same foot that brought him down 
crashed into his chin. His head 
snapped back and he sprawled cm 
the floor. Blood trickled from his 
face. 

“Docchi!” shouted Thorton 
from the screen. 

Docchi didn’t answer. He was 
crashing through the door. The 
commander was lounging against 
the wall. Head down, Docchi ran 
into him. The toaster fell from 
his belt to the floor. With scarcely 
a pause, Docchi stamped on it 



and continued running. 

The commander got to his feet 
and retrieved the weapon. He 
aimed it tentatively at the re- 
treating figure; a thought oc- 
curred to him and he lowered it. 
He examined the damaged mech- 
anism. After that, it went gin- 
gerly into a tunic pocket. 

Muffled shouts were coming 
from Cameron’s office. The gen- 
eral broke in. 

The medicouncilor glared at 
him from the screen. *T can see^ 
that you let him get away.” 

The disheveled officer straight- 
ened his uniform. “I’m sorry, sir. 
I’ll alert the guards immediately.** 

“Never mind now. Revive that 
man.” 

The general wasn’t accustomed 
to giving resuscitation; it was out 
of his line. Nevertheless, in a few 
minutes Cameron was consciousi 
though somewhat dazed. 

“Now then. Doctor, if it wasn’t 
Docchi who was responsible for 
the sudden functioning of the 
gravital drive, who was it?” 

With satisfaction, Cameron 
told him. He had not been wrong 
about the girl. Listening to the 
detailed explanation of Nona’s 
mental abilities, the general was 
perplexed, as generals sometimes 
are. 

“I see.” The medicouncilor 
nodded. “We overlooked that pos- 
ribility altogether. Not the me- 
chanical genius of an engineer. 



ACCIDENTAL PLIOHT 



Instead, the strange telepathic 
sense of a girl. That puts the 
problem in a different light.” 

“It does.” Cameron pressed his 
aching jaw. “She can’t tell us 
how she does it. We’ll have to 
experiment. Fortunately, it won’t 
involve any danger. With the 
monitor system we can always 
control the gravital drive.” 

The medicouncilor leaned peri- 
lously backward and shook his 
head. “You’re wrong. It’s sup- 
posed to, but it doesn’t. We tried. 
For a microsecond, the monitor 
did take over, but the gravital 
computer is smarter than we 
thought, if it was the computer 
that figured out the method. It 
found a way of cutting the power 
from the monitor circuit. It didn’t 
respond at all.” 

Cameron forgot his jaw. “If 
you didn’t bring the rocket back 
on remote, why did she come?” 
“Docchi knows,” growled the 
medicouncilor: “He found out in 
this room. That’s why he es- 
caped.” He tapped on his desk 
with blunt fingers. “She could 
have taken the ship anywhere she 
pleased and we couldn’t have 
stopped her. Since she voluntar- 
ily came back, it’s obvious that 
she wants the asteroid!” 

Medicouncilor Thorton tried to 
shove his face out of the screen 
and into the room. “Don’t you 
ever think, General? There isn’t 
any real difference between grav- 



ital units except size and power. 
What she did to the ship she can 
do as easily to the asteroid." He 
thrust out a finger and pointed 
angrily. “Don’t stand there. Gen- 
eral Judd. Find that girl!” 

It was late for that kind of 
command. The great dome over- 
head trembled and creaked in 
countless joints. The little world 
shivered, groaned as if it had lain 
too long in .an age-old orbit. It 
began to move. 

\^AGUE shapes stirred, crawled, 
’ walked if they could. Fan- 
tastic and near-fantastic figures 
came to the assembly. Huge or 
tiny, on their own legs or bor- 
rowed ones, they arrived, with 
or without arms, faces. The word 
had spread by voice, by moving 
lips, by sign languages of every 
sort. 

“Remember, it will be hours 
or perhaps days before we’re 
safe,” said Docchi. His voice was 
growing hoarse. “It’s up to us 
to see that Nona has all the time 
she needs.” 

“Where is she hiding?” asked 
someone frocp the crowd. 

“I don’t know. If I did, I still 
wouldn’t tell you. It’s our job to 
keep them from finding her.” 
“How?” demanded one near 
the front. “Fight the guards?” 
“Not directly,” said Docchi. 
“We have no arms in the sense of 
weapons. Many of us have no 



S6 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



arms m any sense. All we can 
hope to do is obstruct their 
search. Unless someone has a 
better idea, this is what I plan: 

“I want all the men, older wo- 
men. and the younger ones who 
aren't suitable for reasons I’ll 
explain later. The guards won’t 
be here for another half hour — it 
will take that long to get them 
together and give them the orders 
that the Medicouncil must be 
working out now. When they do 
come, get in their way. 

“How you do that, I’ll leave 
to your imagination. Appeal to 
their sympathy as long as they 
have any. Put yourself in danger- 
ous situations. TheV have ethics; 
at first they’ll be inclined to help 
you. When they do, try to steal 
their weapons. Avoid physical 
violence as much as you can. We 
don’t want to force them into 
retaliation. Make the most of that 
phase of their behavior. It won’t 
last long.” 

Docchi paused and looked over 
the crowd. “Each of you will have 
to decide for himself when to 
drop that kind of resistance and 
start an active battle campaign. 
We have to disrupt the light and 
scanning and ventilation systems, 
for instance. They’ll be forced to 
keep them in repair. Perhaps 
they’ll try to guard these strategic 
points. So much the better for us 
—there will be fewer guards to 
contend with.” 



“What about me?” called a 
woman from far in back. “What 
do I do?” 

“You are in for a rough time,” 
Docchi promised her. “Is Jerian 
here?” 

She elbowed her way to his 
side through the crowd. 

“Jerian,” said Docchi to the 
accidentals, “is a normal, pretty 
woman — outwardly. She has, 
however, no trace of a digestive 
system. The maximum time she 
can go without food and fluid in- 
jections is ten hours. That’s why 
she’s here.” 

Again Docchi scanned the 
group. “I need a cosmetech, 
someone who has her equipment 
with her.” 

A legless woman propelled her- 
self forward. Docchi conferred 
with her. She seemed startled, but 
she complied. Under her deft fin- 
gers Jerian was transformed — in- 
to Nona. 

“She will be the first Nona 
Acy’U find,” explained Docchi, 
“because she can get away with 
the disguise longer. I think — I 
hope — they’ll call off the search 
for a few hours while they test 
her. Eventually they are sure to 
find out. In Jerian’s case, finger- 
prints or X-rays would reveal 
who she is. But that won’t occur 
to them immediately. Nona is im- 
possible to question, as you know, 
and Jerian will act exactly as 
Nona would. 



ACCIDiNTAL FLIGHT

**As soon as they discover that 
Jcrian isn’t Nona — well, they 
won’t bother to be polite, if that’s 
the word for it. The guards will 
like the idea of hnding an attrac- 
tive girl they can manhandle in 
the line of duty, especially if they 
think that will help them find 
Nona. It won’t, of course. But it 
will hold up the search and that’s 
what we want.” 

They stood still, no one mov- 
ing. Women looked at each other 
in silent apprehension. 

“Let’s go,” said Jordan grimly. 

“Wait,” advised Docchi. “I 
have one volunteer Nona. I need 
about fifty more. It doesn’t mat- 
ter if you’re physically sound or 
not — ^we’ll raid the lab for plas- 
tissue. If you think you can be 
made upvto look like Nona, come 
forward.” 

Slowly, singly and by twos and 
threes, they came to him. There 
were few indeed who wouldn’t 
require liberal use of camouflage. 

The rest followed Jordan out. 

Mass production of an individ- 
ual. Not perfect in every instance. 
Good enough to pass in most. 
Docchi watched approvingly, 
•uggesting occasional touches of 
makeup. 

“She can’t speak or hear,” he 
reminded the volunteers. “Re- 
member that at all times, no mat- 
ter what they do. Hide in difficult 
places. After Jerian is taken and 
the search called off and then 




resumed, let yourselves be found 
one at a time. Every guard that 
has to take you for examination 
is one less to look for the real 
Nona. They have to find her soon 
or get off the asteroid.” 

The cosmetechs were busy; 
none stopped. There was one who 
looked up. 

“Get off?” she asked. “Why?” 
“The Sun is getting smaller.” 
“Smaller!” exclaimed the wo- 
man. 

He nodded. “Handicap Haven 
is leaving the Solar System.” 



• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Her fingers flew and molded 
the beautiful curve of a jaw 
where there had been none. Next, 
plastissue lips were applied. 

Nona was soon hiding in half 
a hundred places. 

And one more . 

orbit of Neptune was far 
behind and still the asteroid 
was accelerating. Two giant 
gravital units strained at the core 
of Handicap Haven. The third 
clamped an abnormally heavy 
gravity on the isolated world. 
Prolonged physical exertion was 
awkward and doubly exhausting. 
Hours turned into a day, but the 
units never faltered. 



“Have you figured it out as 
precisely as you should?” asked 
Docchi easily. “You share our 
velocity away from the Sun. 
You’ll have to overcome it be- 
fore you can start going back.” 
The general ignored him. “If 
we could only turn off. that 
damned drive!” 

Engineer Vogel shrugged sick- 
ly. *‘You try it,” he suggested. “I 
don’t want to be around when 
you do. It sounds easy: just a 
gravital unit. But remember 
there’s a good-sized nuclear pile 
involved.” 

“I know we can’t,” admitted 
the general, morosely looking at 
I the darkness overhead. “On the

other hand, we can take off and 
blow this rock apart from a safe 
distance.” 

“And lose all hope of finding 
her?” taunted Docchi. 

“We're losing her anyway,” 
Cameron commented sourly. 

“It’s not as bad as all that,” 
consoled Docchi. “Now that you 
know where the difficulty is, you 
can always build another com- 
puter and furnish it with auxili- 
ary senses. Or maybe build into 
it the facts of elementary astron- 
omy.” 

Cautiously, he shifted his frail 
body under the heavy gravity. 
“There’s another solution, though 
it may not app>eal to you. I can’t 
believe Nona is altogether unique. 
There must be others like her. 
So-(galled ‘born’ mechanics, may- 
be. whose understanding of ma- 
chinery is a form of empathy 
we’ve never suspected. Look hard 
enough and you may find them, 
perhaps in the most unlikely or 
unlovely body.” 

General Judd grunted wearily, 
“If I thought you knew where 
she is — ” 

“You can try to find out,” 
Docchi invited, glowing involun- 
tarily. 

“Forget about the dramatics. 
General.” said Cameron in dis- 
gust. “We’ve questioned him 
thoroughly. Resistance we would 
have had in any event. He’s re- 
sponsible merely for making it 



more effective than we thought 
possible.” 

He added slowly; “At the mo- 
ment, obviously, he’s trying to 
tear down our morale. He doesn’t 
have to bother. The situation is 
so bad that it looks hopeless. I 
can’t think of a thing we can do 
that would help us.” 

The Sun was high in the center 
of the dome. Sun? More like a 
very bright star. It cast no shad- 
ows; the lights in the dome did. 
They flickered and with monot- 
onous regularity went out again. 
The general swore constantly and 
emotionlessly until service was 
restored. 

A guard approach with his cap- 
tive. “I think I've found her, sir.” 

Cameron looked at the girl in 
dismay. “Guard, where’s your de- 
cency?” 

“Orders, sir,” the man said. 

“Whose orders?” 

“Yours, sir. You said she was 
sound of body. How else could I 
find out?” 

Cameron scowled and thrust 
a scalpel deep into the girl’s thigh. 
She looked at him with a tear- 
stained face, but didn’t move a 
muscle. 

“Plastissue, as any fool can 
see,” he commented dourly. 

The guard looked revolted and 
started to lead her out. 

“Let her go,” snapped the doc- 
tor. “Both of you will be safer, 
I think.”

The girl darted away. The ' 
guard followed her, shuddering, 
his eyes filled with a self-loathing 
that Cameron realized would re- 
quire hours of psychiatric work 
to remove. 

Docchi smiled. “I have a re- 
quest to make,” 

‘‘Go ahead and make it,” snort- 
ed tae general. “We’re likely to 
give you anything you want.” 
“You probably will. You’re go- 
ing to leave without her. Very 
soon. When you do go, don’t take 
all your ships. We’ll need about 
three when we come to another 
solar system.” 

General Judd opened his mouth 
in rage. 

“Don’t you say anything you’ll 
regret,” cautioned Docchi. ‘When 
you get back, what will you re- 
port to your superiors? Can you 
tell them that you left in good 
order, while there was still time 
to continue the search? Or will 
they like it better if they know 
you stayed until the last mo- 
ment? So late that you had to 
abandon some of your ships?” 
The general closed his mouth 
and stamped away. Wordlessly, 
Cameron dragged after him.

was no longer the junkpile. It 
was a small world that had be> 
come a swift ship. 

'*We can survive,” said Doc- 
chi. “Power and oxygen, we have, 
and we can grow or synthesize 
our food.” 

He sat beside Anti’s tank, 
which had been returned to the 
usual place. A small tree nodded 
overhead in the artificial breeze. 
It was peaceful enough. But 
Nona wasn’t there. 

“We’ll get you out of the tank,*' 
promised Jordan. “When she 
comes back, we’ll rig up a place 
where there’s no gravity. And 
we’ll continue cold treatment.” 

“I can wait,” said Anti. “On 
this world I’m normal.” 

Docchi stared forlornly about. 
The^ne thing he wanted to sec 
wasn’t there. 

“If you're worrying about 
Nona,” advised Anti, “don’t. The 
guards were pretty rough with 
the women, but plastissue doesn’t 
feel pain. They didn’t find her.” 
“How do you know?” 

“Listen,” said Anti. The ground 
shivered with the power of the 
gravital units. “As long as they’re 
running, how can you doubt?” 
“If I could be sure — 

“You can start now,” Jordan 
said. “First, though, you’d better 
get up and turn around.” 

Docchi scrambled to his feet. 
She was coming toward him. 

She showed no sign of strain. 



Except for a slight smudge on 
her wonderfully smooth and scar- 
less cheek, she might just have 
stepped out of a beauty cubicle. 
Without question, she was the 
most beautiful woman in the 
world. This world, of course, 
though she could have done well 
on any world — if she could have 
communicated with people as 
well as with machines. 

“Where were you hidipg?” 
Docchi asked, expecting no an- 
swer. 

She smiled. He wondered, with 
a feeling of helplessness, if ma- 
chines could sense and appreciate 
her lovely smile, or whether they 
could somehow smile themselves. 

“I wish I could take you in 
my arms,” he said bitterly. 

“It’s not as silly. as you think,” 
said Anti, watching from the 
surface of the tank. “You don’t 
have any arms, but she has two. 
You can talk and hear, but she 
can’t. Between you, you’re a com- 
plete couple.” 

“Except that she would never 
get the idea,” he answered un- 
happily. 

Jordan, rocking on his hands, 
looked up quizzically. “I must 
be something like her. They used 
to call me a born mechanic; just 
put a wrench in my hand and I 
can do anything with a piece of 
machinery. It’s as if I sense what 
the machine wants done to it. 
Not to the extent that Nona can 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



understand, naturally. You might 
say it’s reversed, that she’s the 
one who can hear while I have to 
lip-read.” 

“You never just gabble,” Doc- 
chi prompted. “You have some- 
thing in mind.” 

Jordan hesitated. “I don’t know 
if it’s stupid or what. I was think- 
ing of a kind of sign language 
with machines. You know, start 
with the simple ones, like clocks 
and such, and see what they mean 
to her. Since they’d be banc 
machines, she’d probably have 
pretty basic reactions. Then it’s 
just a matter of—" 

‘‘You don’t have to blueprint 
it," Docchi cut in excitedly. "That 
would be fine for determiniag ele- 
mentary reactions, but I can’t 
carry around a machisM shop; it 
wouldn’t be practicaL There 
ought to be one variable madunc 
that would be portable and yet

“That's right,” Docchi said. 
"I’ve got an idea we can do 
better than normal doctors. Be- 
ing accidental^ ourselves, we 
won’t stop experimenting till we 
succeed. And we have hundredi 
of years to do it in.” 

Glowing, literally, with plea- 
sure, he bent over for Jordan to 
climb on his back. Then he kissed 
Nona and beaded for the labcan- 
tory. 

Nona smiled and followed.

Katahut Said No 






By J. T. M1NT0SH 

When the machine ordered ony 
course of action, the answer 
was always yes. fxcept when — 




niustrated by ED ALEXANDER 



N Earth a town died. Its 
name was Katahut. 

But Katahut was on 
Venus 25 million miles away. 

It was like Koko’s story to the 
Mikado. When Economics Center 
said. “Let a thing be done” it 
was as good as done — practically. 



it was done. When EC said a 
town must die, the town was as 
good as dead — practically, it was 
dead — so why not say so? 

At New York EC headquarters, 
thousands of little cards had run 
upright along tiny, shining run- 
ways. Each card was a town. The 




KATAHUT SAID NO

machine which shuffled and dealt 
them, sent them on fresh journeys 
on the steel runways, br rejected 
them and shot them back the 
way they had come, was not 
strictly an electronic brain. It was 
rather a vast filing system, capa- 
ble of selecting the one relevant 
fact among millions of facts. 
True, an electronic brain was in 
circuit, directing the operation, 
but the brain treated the conclu- 
sions "of the selecto? as sacred, 
questioning nothing. “You do 
your job,” it told the selector, in 
effect, “and I’ll do mine.” 

Lights acted on cells across the 
little runways, modified by holes 
or cuts . in the cards passing 
through. The selector worked for 
a long time, but wasted none of 
it. Jhe hundreds of cards that 
started were at once decimated. 
Those which remained were run 
again and again, a little more 
being taken into consideration 
each time. Rejection became 
slower and slower. Sometimes the 
thirty or so cards left would com- 
plete the run without any being 
eliminated. But the selector al- 
ways had something else to try. 

When there were eleven cards 
left, each was a perfectly good 
solution to the problem fed to the 
selector. But no one would ever 
know that. No one would ever 
ask. 

The selector had its orders. It 
wasn't a batch of eleven cards 



that was wanted; it was one— one 
card representing a town that best 
fitted EC requirements. The se- 
lector, in trouble, applied to the 
electronic brain for guidance. 

The brain pondered unemo- 
tionally and came up with the 
answer that, other things being 
equal, it would be best to select 
the town with the smallest popu- 
lation. 

Within four seconds a card was 
shot into a wire basket in the Co- 
ordinator’s office. He picked it up 
and read the only word printed 
on it — the name of the town. 

“Good God!" he said, aghast. 
“Katahut! Who would have 
thought it?" 

From that moment Katahut 
was as good as dead. 

T he Katahutans heard it oa 
the radio, saw it on the tele- 
vision screens, read it in the news- 
papers, were told about it by their 
neighbors, and then went to the 
city officials to see if it was true. 

The mayor was in a bad posi- 
tion, and no one knew it better 
than he did. On the one hand he 
had lost his office, his town and 
his home and might never be a 
mayor again. On the other, as a 
representative of government and 
law and order, he had to make 
sure that his people understood 
and obeyed the order without ob- 
stinacy or defiance. And all he 
had to say to them was what they 



GALAXY SCIINCi FICTION 



knew already. Being a politician, 
he cursed the stupidity of EC for 
not leaving him some tirty crumb 
of reassurance to give. When your 
house is burned to the ground, 
it’s nice to leam afterward that 
your wife has had the car out. If 
EC had allowed him to tell his 
people about the compensation 
arrangements, say , . 

But they hadn’t. They left him 
to say in words of one syllable 
what EC had said in officialese. 

'Tt is necessary for the eco- 
nomic stability of Venus — ” he 
said, then realized he had quoted 
direct from the official notice. He 
went one step higher on the 
pseudo-Greek facade of the city 
hall. The crowd was growing in 
a way he didn’t like. He would 
soon be a solitary man shouting 
vainly over the heads of people 
who didn’t intend to do anything 
hostile, perhaps, but could relieve 
their feelings by making him look 
silly. 

“Look, people,’’ he said. “They 
aren’t evacuating Katahut for 
fun. There would be chaos if they 
left things as they are. Yes, 
chaos!” he exclaimed, forcing him- 
self to warm up. “Costs in colo- 
nies are high, because so much 
still has to come from Earth. 
Venus has much of: what we need, 
but not enough. There are too 
many small towns on the planet. 
^Too much transport is necessary. 
A careful economic calculation 



has shown that we are one town 
over the critical figure for the 
economic survival of Venus — 
“We have heard all that, Rob- 
ert,” said ex-mayor Hank Todd. 

It was more than an interrup- 
tion, It brought Mayor Henrison 
to a dead stop. Henrison was over 
fifty, but he always felt like a 
small boy before old Hank. He 
couldn’t stop Hank from calling 
him Robert. He couldn’t even try. 
It would make him look silly, 
particularly since everyone called 
Hank Hank. 

“What have you to say, if any- 
thing,” Hank asked, “that isn’t in 
the EC statement?” 

There was the rub. Henrison 
looked helplessly down at the 
tall, thin old man who had been 
mayor before him and who might 
have had this job instead of him. 
What would Hank have done? 
What Was there for anyone to do? 

Henrison was no shirker. He 
made a valiant try. 

“No, I’ve nothing new to say.” 
he admitted. “But what most of 
you want to know is what the 
EC statement means. You should 
know, Hank. But there must be 
others still wondering. Thinking, 
perhaps, that it isn’t really nec- 
essary for us all to pack up and 
go somewhere else. That Eco- 
nomic Center is making a moun- 
tain out of a molehill. I can tell 
them, at least, that that isn’t so.

with mathematicians amusing 
themselves by working out how 
far such-and-such would stretch 
if piled end to end, or how many 
times people yawned in their life. 
It’s a way of getting a clear warn- 
ing of trouble ahead. 

“Without statistics we’d have 
gone on developing Venus, until 
gradually we saw there was some- 
thing wrong with the works, tried 
to correct it and couldn’t. We'd 
probably never know that all that 
was wrong was that there was one 
small town too many on the 
planet, and that if we’d evacuate 
it, shut it up and dismantled it, 
the colony would never have 
failed.” 

Hank seemed to have ap- 
pointed himself spokesman. No- 
body disputed it. Hank was still 
a good man and he had the right 
kind of experience. He wasn’t 
afraid to give a lead, which was 
what everyone wanted — even 
Henrison, if the puzzled, vexed 
people in front of him would only 
realize it. 

“You trust these statistics, 
Robert?” Hank asked. 

“Certainly I do. A doctor gives 
you a drug that may be poison. 
You may even know it’s poison. 
You don’t know that it’ll help 
you to take it. You have to take 
his word for it. I’m no statistician, 
Hank, any more than you are, 
but I’m ready to believe the 
answers.” 



“The answers of a mechanical 
brain.” 

Henrison knew the value of 
demonstration. He pulled out a 
small calculating machine. He 
pressed the buttons. “Twelve tq 
the F>ower of five is 248832,” he 
said. “That’s not a difficult cal- 
culation. You can work it out 
on the back of an envelope in a 
few seconds. And when you do, 
you find it’s right. After a bit you 
don’t check the answers any 
more. You just check the ma- 
chine every now and then, which 
the technicians do, of course. I 
think we can trust the answer, 
Hank.” 

Hank said nothing, thinking. 
There was suddenly dead silence. 
In the curious emphatic way of 
crowds, everyone knew that a de- 
cision would be made and their 
course set in the next few sec- 
onds. It might be Hank’s way, it 
might be Henrison’s, it might be 
something quite different. 

“I think,” said Hank quietly, 
“that a town, like an individual, 
has a right to live.” 

The crowd cheered that wildly, 
as if it were a long, brilliant and 
impassioned speech. It was the 
first hint that someone thought 
the EC ruling needn’t be final. 
No one wanted to be the first to 
suggest that there should be any 
resistance to the ruling. Perhaps 
even Hank himself needed that 
cheer before he took any definite 






GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



step or made any decision. 

Having heard it, he turned and 
faced the crowd. 

“I’m going to the EC depot 
at Cannap,” he said. “Anyone 
coming with me?” 

’Yjf/HY the Coordinator on 
** Earth had been aghast when 
the name of Katahut came out 
of the selector was that Katahut 
was perhaps the only small town 
on Venus which he knew by name. 
It had been the first settlement 
on Venus, founded fifty years be- 
fore. It had not been developed 
much, and it had not grown, be- 
cause it was only by chance that 
the first ship had landed there. 
Otherwise the site had little to 
commend it. It was not on a 
river. There were no iron or coal 
deposits near by. The soil, for 
Venus, was not particularly good. 
It had been used as a base, no 
more, and the big and important 
towns had sprung up elsewhere. 

Now it wasn’t even a base. 
Cannap was the capital, Regis 
the main spaceport, Harun the 
great supply base, Cornfield the 
industrial center. There was no 
economic reason for Katahut to 
exist. So after the first mild shock 
— for the name of Katahut was 
taught in schools — everyone saw 
that the natural choice, if a town 
had to be eliminated, was Kata- 
hut. They forgot, perhaps, that 
there were other small towns on 



Venus which served as little pur- 
pose as Katahut and had no his- 
torical significance. It didn’t oc- 
cur to them that the Katahutans 
had any genuine complaint. Many 
cities on Earth had been evacu- 
ated. It was wasteful to let town* 
for which there was no real pur- 
pose die a slow and painful eco- 
nomic death. 

Indeed, most people had come 
to accept the benevolent rule of 
Economic Center, which gave 
them more leisure and put more 
money in their pockets to spend, 
to such an extent that it was al- 
most taken for granted that ev- 
eryone, everywhere, had done the 
same thing. Perhaps EC was a 
little abrupt with Katahut. At 
one time, before such a step was 
taken, there had been cautious, 
psychologically correct prepara- 
tion. The people in a town to be 
evacuated — all on Earth, so far, 
apart from two on Mars which 
evacuated themselves — were 
shown the advantages of the de- 
cision, given plenty of time, 
encouraged for a while to move 
between their old place of resi- 
dence and the new, and helped 
in every way. 

But that hadn’t been necessary 
lately. The redistribution of pop- 
ulation was only a tiny part cd 
the concerns of EC and didn’t get 
much publicity. Occasionally. « 
particularly picturesque evacua- 
tion would rate an illustrated ar-

tide in the photographic maga- 
zines. The exacuation of a town 
with no economic purpose, as a 
rule, was worth only three or four 
lines in the newspapers which 
didn’t cover that area. 

Katahut, of course, would rate 
much more than that, even on 
Mars. Most of the news value of 
the evacuation would be in its 
name and history, some in the 
fact that it was the first Venusian 
town to be affected, with a good 
bit of propaganda because it was 
the only economic adjustment 
necessary on Venus, according to 
the EC survey. 

Later, naturally, it was pointed 
out with heat, irony, amusement 
and cool disdain that one simple 
question to an electronic brain fed 
with ^all the data would have 
shown exactly what would hap- 
pen. That was the trouble with 
cybernetics. It wasn’t merely that 
the data had to be correct and 
complete. It was not enough that 
the right questions should be 
asked. 

All the right questions had to 
be asked. 

And no one thought of asking: 
‘‘Suppose Katahut raises such a 
row that the whole question of 
compulsory evacuation has to be 
reviewed?” 

Others, of course, said an elec- 
tronic brain wasn’t necessary for 
that. Common sense ought to 
have shown EC enough to pre- 



vent the mistake. 

. Everyone, as usual, was very 
good at shutting the stable door 
after the horse had bolted. 

H ank hadn’t been allowed to 
bring anyone in with him. 
The EC chief at Cannap was 
quite prepared to see him, give 
him a drink and have a friendly 
chat, but as Hank was obviously 
the man who mattered in Kata- 
hut’s mild revolt against EC — ^ 
like a rabbit trying to push a 
ten-ton truck off its front door 
— it would be far better to deal 
with him direct, without giving 
him the advantage of a sympa- 
thetic audience. 

“You want to be satisfied that 
this step is necessary, Mr. Todd,” 
the EC local chief said. “Very 
natural. It may seem to you, an 
intelligent but untrained man, 
that some other method would 
get the same results, or that the 
selector on Earth didn’t know its 
job. 

“What we work for, Mr. Todd, 
is balance. Only a balanced econ- 
omy can be a healthy economy. 
Now Venusian development is 
held back at the moment by set- 
tlements which are moribund but 
refuse to die. Katahut, for ex- 
ample. You may think your town 
pays its way. In a sense it does, 
but only at the expense of the 
rest of Venus. As you know, we 
long ago adopted a policy of 



7# 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



equalization of freight charges on 
Venus, so that everything you 
buy in Katahut costs exactly 
what it costs anywhere else on 
the planet. I won’t go into the 
reasons for this, but we don’t have 
to argue about that, do we? Now 
the existence of Katahut — ” 

“That,” said Hank, “is exactly 
the point. I was wondering when 
you’d get to it.” 

The EC chief raised his eye- 
brows at this rustic bluntness. 

“I didn’t want to interrupt,” 
said Hank, “but the very first 
step was wrong. I don’t want to 
be satisfied that this step is nec- 
essary. I’m not going to argue on 
the lines of ‘necessary to whom or 
to what?’ Suppose you came to 
me and told me my death was 
necessary to the survival of the 
human race. I’d still want to 
live.” 

The EC man smiled coldly. 
“This is hardly a question of life 
or death, Mr. Todd.” 

“No, it’s a question of liberty, 
which is often more important 
than life or death. And don’t 
sigh and think ‘fanatic’ to your- 
self, either. We’ve got a nice little 
town which suits me and a lot 
of other people. The soil may not 
grow orchids, but it suits my 
truck garden. We’ve got a mayor 
who is honest and isn’t a fool. 
The preacher says the kind of 
things we like to hear on Sundays. 
We live in a place that we and 



our fathers built. 

“Maybe you can give me an« 
other place where I can grow 
vegetables and where there’s ■ 
good mayor and a good preacher^ 
But you can’t give me Ted Jacob* 
next door and Cuan O’Farrell up 
the street and Bill Houliston on 
the other side of town when I 
want a good argument. Look, Mr. 
EC Chief, suppose all you say i* 
true — what do we owe Venus? 
We came here and made our beds 
and you won’t let us lie on them. 
We didn’t develop away from 
you; you developed away from 
us. That’s your funeral, not ours.** 

“Mr. Todd, I hope you^e not 
going to say that science — ” 

But Hank was properly wound 
up by this time. “I’m not going 
to say anything about science and 
neither are you. I don’t know 
what you were going to say, but 
it wasn’t about science; ^it was 
about gadgetry. A metal brain 
said we had to shift. What has 
that to do with science? The 
brain only said the kind of thing 
you built it to say. You could 
have done the same thing without 
any machines, by making tables 
instead. Read down the columns 
and then across and finally you 
prove that x is equal to x. EC is 
playing with a toy, Mr. EC Chief, 
like a new watch. 

“A watch and an electronic 
brain tell you what you make 
them tell you. Does the brain on 



KATAHUT SAID NO 



71 



Earth know anything about my 
cucumbers? Does it know Cuati 
O’Farrcll? When it does. I'U be 
pleased to meet it. Until then, I 
don't see why I should let it run 
my life.” 

Hank was entirely wrong and 
the EC chief told him so. But 
Hank had been a local politician 
for thirty years, so he didn’t stay 
on one subject long enough to be 
nailed down. He didn’t know ex> 
actly what he was trying to do. 
He only knew that whenever 
there was an opening, he would 
try to squeeze through it. 

And suddenly there it was. 

**Of course, if it’s the unani- 
mous verdict of the people of 
Katahut that they want to remain 
where they are, as a community 
...” the EC chief hedged at last. 

Hank pounced on it. “Yes? 
what then?” , 

"Why, we might find it possible 
to evacuate another similar town. 
Or make other similar adjust- 
ments as indicated by the cyber- 
netics department.” 

Hank knew he had no time to 
think. To get the EC chief into 
a comer, he had had to go into 
it himself. He knew — none could 
know better — how difficult it was 
to get a unanimous verdict on 
anjrthing which affected a lot of 
people in many different ways. 
But . 

"Right,” he said, rising. "I ac- 
cept your conditions. Without 



reservations. I better leave now.* 

The EC man was put off stroke, 
wondering what conditions he 
had offered. 

When Hank had gone, the chief 
got on the radiophone to Venus 
Space Station I to Earth Space 
Station III to EC headquarters, 
and asked for the Coordinator. 
He was no fool. He told the Co- 
ordinator coolly what had hap- 
pened, knowing that he would 
make a much better impression 
that way than apologizing and 
excusing himself. He did. The 
Coordinator said nothing but, 
“Wait.” 

The Cannap chief waited for 
forty-five seconds. Then the Co- 
ordinator was back. “The elec- 
tronic brain says there will be no 
unanimous verdict.” 

“Does the electronic brain,” 
asked the Cannap chief irrele- 
vantly, "know Hank Todd's cu- 
cumbers?” 

It didn’t, of course. There was 
no reason why it should. 

N ot in any way was it the 
fault of the electronic brain. 
It had had insufficient data, many 
important things like Hank 
Todd’s cucumbers being omitted. 
It didn’t know Cuan O’Farrell 
and it didn’t know Bill Houliston. 

Curiously enough, Cuan O’Far- 
rell was one of Hank’s most ob- 
trusive stumbling-blocks. He not 
only wouldn't sign the roll, he 



72 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



went round after Hank and old 
Bill persuading people to take 
their names off it. 

“This,” Hank told him grimly, 
“has got to stop.” 

“I agree,” Cuan said cordially. 
“It’s a lot of nonsense, and the 
sooner you stop making a fool 
of yourself, the better.” 

Hank talked for four hours 
without getting to first base. 
Then suddenly, as he was dozing 
off that night, he came -awake 
with a shout, jumped out of bed 
and into his pants. 

Cuan was already asleep and 
was even less prepared, when 
roused, to listen to reason than he 
had been that afternoon, 

“You say,” said Hank, “that 
it’s no violation of freedom to 
split us up and send us to the 
four corners of Venus?” 

“This afternoon I did,” Cuan 
retorted, “and tomorrow I will 
again. Right now I want to sleep.” 
“You’re a socialist, Cuan.” 
“Did you waken me up to tell 
me that? I've been a socialist for 
sixty-five years.” 

What Cuan meant by socialism 
was quite different from anything 
ever meant by the word before 
space travel began. But that was 
incidental. 

“Suppose you were mayor, 
Cuan?” 

Cuan came fully awake and 
looked shrewdly at Hank. He was 
suspicious, but interested. 



“I’m not,” he pointed out. 

“No, but this is a question o£ 
liberty and the rights of man. 
Suppose you’d worked on this 
town for the fifty years of its ex- 
istence and at last got yourself 
elected mayor. If they split up 
the town, all your work on social** 
ism would have been wasted. You 
see that? You’d have to start in 
some other town, fifty years too 
late. Would that be right?” 
Cuan looked at him unblink- 
ingly for a while. Then he said: 
“No, it would not be right. You 
got that petition handy?” 

Next to Cuan, Mary Brook- 
sh^w was the most difficult. 
M^ary, who was always called 
May, was eighteen and the pret- 
tiest girl in Katahut. She was 
leaving an3rway. Katahut was 
nothing to her. She saw no reason 
why it shouldn’t be evacuated. 

“It’s a dull, priggish, half-dead 
little place,” she told Hank hotly, 
“full of dull, priggish, half-dead 
little people. It should have been 
broken up long ago. There are 
still people who won’t speak to 
me because I once walked down 
the street in a sunsuit, because I 
don’t go to church and because I 
wouldn’t marry Jim Jacobs. And, 
because I’ve been out with two or 
three different boys, even people 
who like me call me boy-crazy. 
This is a town where you’re guilty 
until you’re proved innocent.” 
“It's your home. May,” Hank 



KATAHUT SAID NO 



73 



said quietly. “Far more than ours. 
I was born on Earth. You were 
not only bom here, your father 
and mother were.” 

“They’re dead and I’m leav- 
ing,” said May. “I’ve had eighteen 
years here and it seems like a 
thousand.” 

“The first eighteen are always 
the worst.” 

May grinned \inwillingly. 
“Don't get me wrong about this, 
Hank,” she said. “I like you. You 
were nice to me when I was a 
kid, and no more and no less 
nice to me when I grew up. If 
you’d had a son or maybe a 
grandson, I guess I could have 
gone for him and I might have 
been your daughter-in-law or 
granddaughter-in-law. If it was 
just ^ personal thing, I’d sign 
your petition like a shot. But 
what I feel is that everyone who 
signs that sheet of yours has to 
feel this town’s worth saving, and 
I don’t.” 

Hank recognized defeat and 
left her alone. Perhaps, since she 
was leaving, the EC men wouldn’t 
think the absence of her name 
on the list kept the verdict from 
being unanimous. 

Later on, when it began to look 
as if, after all, there was a chance 
of getting the unanimous verdict, 
Hank wasn’t so happy about 
May’s refusal to sign the petition. 

Then she walked in shame- 
facedly and signed. “People have 



been so decent lately,” she com- 
plained. “Did you put them up 
to it? No, I suppose you wouldn’t. 
You’re too straight. Presentations, 
good-luck tokens, everybody say- 
ing they were sorry I was going 
and they hoped I’d be back some 
time. Then I realized there 
wouldn’t be anywhere to come 
back to. Maybe the fact that 
there are two generations of 
Henshaws buried in the church- 
yard means something after all. 
They didn’t live long, did they?’* 
Hank was very tender with her. 
He knew somehow that she 
wouldn’t live long either. What- 
ever anyone said about the Hen- 
shaws, nobody could accuse them 
of being lucky. 

Y oung Tom HolUns, unlike 
Cuan and May, wasn’t diffi- 
cult at all. He just wouldn’t sign. 

Tom was a tall, good-looking 
young fellow — the right type for 
May, one would have thought. 
But they had bounced apart in 
childhood somehow, and never got 
together again. Tom didn’t often 
argue, but when he- was sure he 
was right about something, there 
was no shaking him. 

“You see yourself as a cru- 
sader,” he told Hank. “On one 
side the cold, fcelinglcss machine, 
on the other the old man cham- 
pioning the little people.” 

“If you say so, Tom,” said 
Hank agreeably. 



74 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Tom grinned. “You're good at 
it. of course,” he admitted. 
“You’ve done wonders already. 
But you’re all wrong. This isn’t 
a battle between men and ma- 
chines.” 

“Just what I’ve been saying all 
along,” said Hank. “I’ve got 
nothing again electronic brains. 
They do their job. All I say is 
we shouldn’t be shifted if we 
don’t want to shift.” 

“No force? No coercion?” 
“That’s right.” 

“Well. I hope you’ll be con- 
sistent and not try to coerce me 
into signing your protest.” 

“You think the machine is 
right?” 

“Yes.” 

“You want the machine to be 
right?” 

“Sure I do. Why not?” 

“You’d rather a mechanical 
brain was right than a human 
one?” 

“Hank, no doubt you could ar- 
gue the hind leg off a horse, but 
you’re not going to get the chance 
to argue the hind leg off me. I’ll 
come around and help you to 
collect signatures if you like, but 
1 won’t sign.” 

“That’s a curious attitude.” 
“Could be. It’s simple enough 
if you put it this way — I’ll help 
you because I like you, but I 
won’t sign the roll because I don’t 
think it’s right. See?” 

About that time the EC chief 



from Gannap came to \nsit Kata- 
hut. Hank welcomed him gravely, 
but with inward glee. The EC 
man was worried. He had heard 
how the protest was going. 

He told Hank; “I hear most 
of the people in town think as 
you do, Mr. Todd.” 

“It’s beginning to look that 
way.” 

“Of course, this petition isn’t 
official, you understand. You are 
the prime mover in this appeal, 
and though I understand you 
once were mayor of the town, you 
no longer hold ...” 

Hank cut that short. “Mayor 
Henrison was one of the first to 
sign. Want him to make it of- 
ficial?” 

ri'HE EC chief was ready to try 
anything, apparently. He had 
made several other objections, 
none of which cut any ice, and he 
seemed to know it. 

At last he said: “Mr. Todd, 
I’ll be frank with you. I had no 
authority to suggest that a unan- 
imous protest would make us 
change our minds over the evac- 
uation of Katahut. In fact, I 
didn’t. You grabbed the idea and 
left before I could explain.” 
“You’re going back on your 
word, you mean.” said Hank af- 
fably. 

“Not exactly ...” 
“Approximately is near enough. 
When do the troops move in?” 



KATAHUT SAID NO 



75 



EC chief was startled. 

Hank was a jump ahead of 
him. “Your obvious plan,” re^ 
marked Hank, “is to get me on 
incitement to violence. It won’t 
be easy. I’m past the age of vio- 
lence myself, and I haven’t said 
any more to anyone than that 
they should stay put.” 

“Mr. Todd, you have shown 
yourself a very capable man. EC 
needs men like you. Age doesn’t 
matter, for it doesn’t seem to 
bother you. I — ” 

“That may be the best ap- 
proach,” Hank said thoughtfully, 
nodding. “If you want me to kick 
; cii irto the street, all you have 
tf :'o is come right out with it 
: I ' o.'.‘;r to bribe me.” 

The EC chief groped for words. 
“I j^ish you would undTStand. 
It’s a simple question of neces- 
sity. We must evacuate one of 
these small uneconomic towns. 
It’s all very well for you to say, 
’Why Katahut?’ But if Katahut 
gets away with this, do you think 
any other small town will submit? 
No. they’ll say, “You didn’t evac- 
uate Katahut, so why come to 
us?” 

“And quite right t#o. Towns 
have a right to live, just like 
irdi''k’uals.” 

“Eut now v/c can the 

• i \ : 1 factors ' nd tlir : .1 .er for 
"'•It ' I't dc: ' : c" o 'i right. 
t.ook. ? »r. you pv>y be a 

.lero here and nu.v, but in a hun- 



dred years or less you’ll be cursed 
as the reactionary who brought 
the whole Venusian colony down 
in ruins.” 

“Oh, come now. You may have 
an electronic brain that can tell 
you how long to roast meat and 
whether it will rain on Tuesday, 
but not whether a town should 
die. There must be some other 
way.” 

“There's no other way!” the 
EC chief protested. “Some day 
we may have a civilization that 
isn’t built on economics, but we 
haven’t got it now. Before cyber- 
netics, things just took their 
course. Tl^ey went wrong or right. 
If they went wrong, it was often 
possible to say /afer that it was 
at one precise point that the mis- 
take was made. Cybernetics tells 
us now where the mistake is, so 
that we don’t need to make it. 
The whole future of the human 
race — ” 

“Now let's not lose our sense 
of proportion,” said Hank gently. 
“All we’re talking about, at most, 
is the future of the colony of 
Venus.” 

“All right, the whole fiitn’-e of 
the colony of Venus hangs on 
just this one little thing.” 

“But wC’ don’t tl'-ink it’s httle

thing. Ask your machine -. ■me 
other questions. '’’11 it tbf' first 
'■ohition is no good, because 11 Hta- 
hut says no.” 









GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The EC chief went away. The 
next day was the original date 
set for the evacuation of Kata- 
hut. He said he’d be back. Hank 
didn’t doubt it. Neither did Tom 
Hollins, who had been a witness 
at the interview. 

“Maybe I should argue,” said 
Tom. “Not to let you convince 
me that I should sign the roll, 
but to try to ’ convince you that 
you should give up the whole idea 
and let them evacuate Katahut.” 

“Maybe you should,” agreed 
Hank. “Wouldn’t do a bit of 
good. My cucumbers are coming 
al^ng fine. So is the petition, for 
what it’s worth. You know, you’re 
the only one who hasn’t signed 
it, Tom. How about making it 
unanimous?” 

Tom shook his head, grinning. 

HEN the EC chief came 
back the next morning, he 
brought a hundred Cannap police 
officers and fifty trucks with him. 
Hank surveyed them grimly. On 
his right, Cuan O’Farrell stroked 
his chin thoughtfully. On his left, 
Tom Hollins raised his eyebrows 
as the police quietly dispersed 
through the small town. 

“The petition,” said the EC 
chief, flanked by two uniformed 
officers. “Is it unanimous?” 

“Not quite.” said Hank. 

“Then ...” 

“Wait a bit,” murmured Tom 
Hollins. “What are these men 



here for? And all those trucks?' 

“There may be a little trouble 
We want to be ready for it. If the 
petition had been unanimous, of 
course, we might ...” 

“It looks to me.” said Tom, 
“as if the fact that the petition 
isn’t unanimous is only an excuse. 
You didn’t wait to get the answer 
before you sent your men to do 
whatever it is they are doing. And 
you didn’t bring all those trucks 
for nothing. Let’s try something, 
shall we? Hank, where do I sign?” 
“I think you’re right,” Hank 
remarked. “It doesn’t make any 
difference. The petition is com- 
plete, Mr. EC Chief. The nex' 
move is up to you.” 

“I’m sorry. We hoped yo\ 
would fail. It would have made

terday, the petition can’t be al- 
lowed to make any difference. 
This is too important.” 

They heard a girl’s scream 
and May Henshaw appeared, 
thrown over the shoulder of a 
policeman, but still kicking and 
struggling. 

“From my previous experience 
of May,” said Tom, “I’m sur- 
prised that one man can handle 
her. We’ll see what — ” 

Hank held him back. “I think 
May will manage.” he said. 

He was right. When May wa. 
dropped to her feet, she deal. 
with her captor with extreme ef- 
ficiency. Tom applauded loudly.

"Now if she’d been as ugly as 
sin,” he remarked, “she’d never 
have learned that. It’s rather sad, 
but girls as pretty as May can 
usually look after themselves.” 

He had spoken casually. Cuan 
and Hank were old. He wasn’t. 
He swung at the EC chief and 
the chief felt it. Whether his nose 
was broken remained to be seen. 
It was certainly badly bent. 

The population of Katahut was 
eight hundred and twenty-three. 
There were a hundred policemen. 
That meant 8.23 Katahutans for 
every cop. And the cops had or- 
ders not to be unduly violent. 
People like Tom Hollins were 



under no such disadvantages. 

It was a comic battle. It isn’t 
funny when the weak are hurt, 
but in the battle of Katahut the 
only people who were hurt were 
cops, and that’s always funny. 
Hank moved around under the 
capable protection of Tom and 
May, making sure that no serious 
damage was done. It was better 
to tear the pants off the police- 
man than hit them over the head. 
Without pants they could still 
move, and all the movement was 
out of Katahut. 

A man isn’t necessarily a cow- 
ard when he runs from a woman. 
More policemen ran from May

than from Tom. In fact, there was 
a brief period when Tom, m diffi- 
culties, was very glad of May's 
help and protection. 

But May, after all, only had 
120 po\inds or so at her com- 
mand. Some of the other women 
had nearly twice that. Muscle, 
too, not the soft flesh of Earth- 
bound housewives and secretaries. 
They could hoe a row or chop a 
tree with any man-— or poke a 
jaw, for that matter. 

When one of the policemen got 
a truck going, there was a wild 
rush to climb aboard. The truck 
wobbled off in the general direc- 
tion of Cannap, with nearly forty 



cops clinging to it — and hardly 
half a dozen whole pairs of pants. 

In an hour there wasn’t a cop 
left in Katahut except the two 
local policemen, who darted home 
to get out of uniform in case 
anyone should make a mistake. 

"tTANK and Cuan and Tom and 
Bill and May, breathless 
but content, looked down the 
dusty road. 

“Will they come back?” Cuan

Hank pondered. “I don’t think

that. I was careful not to raise 
a hand in anger. You’d better 
keep out of the way, Tom. I 
don’t think it matters for ydu,

quite rightly, to go to hell. I

thought it was a good story. 

Hardly anyone paid any at- 
tention to the serious articles in 
the same papers pointing out that 
Katahut’s fight for life was all 
very well, but if the electronic 
brain said this meant economic 
chaos in Venus, it was probably 
right. 

It was right, of course.

CARBON.14 AND THE ICE AGE 



T he man who is used to dis- 
tances expressed in miles 
and to time intervals 
measured in years always feels 
at a loss when it comes to astro- 
nomical distances and to geologi- 
cal times. He hears an astronomer

tively near star, only eleven light- 
years away” — each light-year be- 
ing 5,880,000,000,000 miles! Or he 
hears a geologist say that a lump 
of coal was forest 400 million 
years ago. Of course, scientists

are now generally believed to 
know what they are talking 
about, but the astronomical 
measurement is still one thing, 
for after all, that star can be seen 
and photographed, while the time 
measurement is another. Who, I 
was once asked acidly, kept a 
calendar? 

There is a one-word answer to 
that question. Not who, but what. 
Answer: radioactivity. 

Just about half a century ago 
it was realized that the radio- 
active decay of uranium produces 
helium. The late Lord Rutherford 
of Nelson realized one possible 
application of this phenomenon 
immediately. This, he said, would 
[permit dating the age of minerals, 
provided the minerals had 
trapped the helium. All one had 
to do was to measure the helium 
content of a mineral, then its 
uranium content, and make a 
good guess how much helium has 
escaped. That way the age of the 
oldest minerals was determined 
as 700 million years. If one as- 
sumed that half of the helium had 
managed to seep out, the true age 
would be double that figure. 

A few years later Prof. Bolt- 
wood came up with a better sug- 
gestion. Helium, just because it 
could and probably did escape, 
was not reliable enough. But 
meanwhile it had been found that 
uranium changed ultimately into 
lead, which did not escape. One 

82 



merely had to measure and com- 
pare the uranium and lead con- 
tents. With his method Prof. 
Boltwood determined the age of 
the oldest minerals as 2,200,000,- 
000 years. When this figure was 
first announced, about 1910, it 
seemed so fantastic that it was 
generally disbelieved. But it was 
accepted only a few years later, 
especially since a number of sci- 
entists had done their best to ac- 
celerate or decelerate natural 
radioactive processes. They had 
tried heat and cold, pressure and 
vacuum, electric and magnetic 
field, and every combination of 
them. The very fact that they had 
failed utterly was important. If 
nothing they, could think of and 
apply made any impression on 
the rate of change, it was likely 
that nothing that would happen 
in Nature would change the rate. 

But this uranium-lead method, 
joined some time later by the 
thorium-lead method, was ap- 
plicable only for long intervals. 
One could measure 20 million 
years, but not 900 years. It was 
like the speedometer of a car 
which will tell you that you have 
driven 150 miles, but which can- 
not be used to measure two yards 
of cloth. For that you need a 
tape measure. 

One of the most important de- 
velopments of the postwar years 
is that a reliable method for dat- 
ing comparatively short periods 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of time is now in existence. De* 
vcloped originally by Drs. J. R. 
Arnold and W. F. Libby of the 
University of Chicago, it also re- 
lies on . the measurement of re- 
sidual radioactivity. But the 
radioactivity element involved is 
not one of the heavy elements 
which stays active for millions 
and millions of years. It is a 
comparatively short-lived isotope 
of carbon with the mass 14, con- 
sequently. the method is known 
as the carbon-14 or C-14 method. 

C-14 has a so-called “half life” 
of 5,568 years (with an uncer- 
tainty of 30 years either way), 
which means that at the end of 
£.568 years a piece of pure C-14 
would be half gone as far as 
radioactivity is concerned. With 
such a short half life, C-14 would 
have vanished from the face of 
the Earth long ago and would 
by now be something which-might 
be determined by theory — if it . 
were not formed constantly. 

Cosmic rays transform a few 
nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere 
into C-14 at a steady rate. Com- 
bined with oxygen, these C-14 
atoms appear as carbon dioxide, 
are absorbed by plants, go into 
starches, are eaten by animals 
and men. In short, every living 
thing is permeated to a known 
extent with the “hot” atoms of 
C-14. As soon as the living thing 
dies, it stops absorbing C-14. A 
beam fashioned from a tree that 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



was felled 5,600 years ago will 
show half as much radioactivity 
from C-14 atoms as a beam from 
a tree felled last year. 

It is easy to understand the 
principle. If the C-14 activity of 
a living thing is known, one only 
has to measure the radioactivity 
of a no-longer-living substance. 
If one can be sure that there is 
no radioactivity from other 
sources around, the two figures 
can be compared directly. 

When Dr. Libby began his 
work, he naturally first tested his 
method by measuring the age of 
things which did not need meas- 
uring, because their age was 
known. One of the first objects 
he tested was a piece of wood 
from a fallen sequoia tree which 
had been sawed through. Boton- 
ists had counted the tree rings to 
determine its age. It must have 
been a tedious job, for there were 
2,928 of them! Dr. Libby re- 
duced his sample to pure carbon 
and went to work with Geiger 
counter and slide rule. The re- 
sult was 3,005 years, which is 
close enough for any purpose. 

Then he tested a piece of wood 
from a Hittite palace in Syria. 
Historians had dated the palace 
as having been built not earlier 
than 725 B. C. and not later than 
625 B. C. The C-14 method gave 
the age of the wood as 2,600 
years. Another test was a piece 
of wood from an Egyptian sar- 



cophagus which actually had a 
date on it. That date read, in 
our terminology, 330 B. C. The 
C-14 method said that the wood 
was 2300 years old. 

Some of these tests, besides 
proving the acuracy of the C-14 
method, incidentally show that 
the methods of dating developed 
by the historians were correct too. 
All historical objects that could 
be dated were found to agree 
within a few years with the dates 
assigned to them by the his- 
torians. 

I wrote “all historical objects 
that could be dated,” for not 
every historical object can be 
tested by the C-14 method. The 
method works only with things 
which were once alive. You can- 
not dat^ an old armor, nor a 
Stone ruin, nor an old sword. But 
if that sword has a bone handle, 
you can date the handle. 

The restriction to objects o^ 
organic origin is one of the four 
limitations of the C-14 method. 
The second is that the object to 
be dated must weigh at least one 
ounce. The third limitation is 
that the object is destroyed in 
the process. And the fourth is 
that there is a time limit. Be- 
cause of the short half life of 
C-14, the method begins to waver 
when the object is 20,000 years 
old; at such an age, there is very 
little radioactivity left. And 
25,000 years is as far as it will go. 



The C-14 method has led to a 
number of surprising results, es- 
•pecially when applied to Indian 
relics. For reasons not known to 
me, archeologists thought that the 
Indians of the Hudson Valley 
area had settled there in fairly 
recent times. But C-14 measure- 
ments of relics gave rather high 
ages, the oldest of them dating 
back to 3,000 B. C. Fiber sandals 
found in eastern Oregon, com- 
pletely undatable in any other 
way, were found to be 9,000 years 
old. 

In addition to having improved 
archeology, the C-14 method has 
also had some influence on recent 
geology. On a map of the State 
of Oregon, you’ll easily locate 
Crater Lake National Park, with 
Crater Lake in the center. It was 
obvious from geological evidence 
that the volcano which is now 
water-filled must have exploded 
at a comparatively recent time. 
But geologists could only say 
that it was sometime between 
15,000 and 25,000 years ago, 
maybe a little longer, possibly 
somewliat less. Then somebody 
found a tree which had been de- 
stroyed by § lava flow from that 
eruption. Of course it had been 
burned to charcoal, but charcoal 
can be tested. It turned out that 
the eruption had taken place 
6,300 years ago, just about half 
the time of the lowest estimate 
made.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The most important result so 
far is the actual dating of the 
Ice Age. The whole Ice Age. con- 
sisting of four glaciations inter- 
rupted by much longer intergla- 
cial periods, is estimated to have 
lasted one million years, from its 
very beginnings to the melting 
of the glaciers during their last 
retreat. The customary figure 
given for the melting away of the 
glaciers of the last advance was 
20.000 years. Since this was a 
figure that was still within reach 
of the C-14 method, some Ice 
Age material was tested. In Wis- 
consin tliere was a forest which 
had been pushed down by the 
glaciers of the last advance, and 
this was worked on. 

The result sounded incredible 
at first: 12.000 years. This was

D id you ever miss making an

if I hadn’t been behind in my 
reading, I might have contributed 
to something which is still a 
controversial matter. And every 
time I see a robin . 

But let me begin at the begin- 
ning, which happens to be in 
Australia, even though the story 
itself is essentially an American 
one. Australia is, as everybody 
knows, the land of strange ani- 



more recent by far than anybody 
had believed, especially since it 
marked the last advance, not 
the last retreat. The retreat could 
not be studied in Wisconsin; but 
in Nebraska they found an old 
forest which had grown up after 
the retreat of the last ice sheet. 
They gave an age of 10,500 
years. Comparable material from 
Europe, procured in a great 
hurry, gave figures which dif- 
fered from the Wisconsin and 
Nebraska result only within the 
expected margin of error. The 
overall length of the Ice Age 
probably was what geologists say, 
but the last glaciation was much 
closer to our time than believed. 
It was still going strong 12.000 
years ago. but it lasted for less 
than 20 centuries.

mats. But it seems as if the 
Australians did not know as 
much of their -animals as one 
would wish — it also seems that 
they “knew” a lot of things that 
weren’t so— and a quarter-cen- 
tury ago the Australian publish- 
ing firm of Angus & Robertson 
decided to do a set of books on 
Australian Natural History, writ- 
ten by Australians for Austral- 
ians. One of these was about 
Australian birds, written by Alec 
H Chisholm and published, in 
1935. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



I own a copy of that book, on 
page 153 of which there are two 
paragraphs reading: 

Early in 1934 a boy living near Mel- 
bourne wrote to me, stating that he 
had seen English Starlings picking up 
ants in their beaks and placing them 
under their wings. If this had been 
the first report of the kind I should 
have doubted the evidence of the boy’s 
eyes. However, seven years previously 
a Sydney man, one who had watched 
birds in aviaries and in the wild during 
many years, had asked me; “What is 
the reason why soft-billed birds such 
as starlings, jays, etc., when on the 
ground, pick up soldier ants, put- them 
under their wings, and after a while 
take them out again?” 

Now, the- bare facts having been 
stated, the reader knows as much of 
this matter as I do, and probably as 
much as anyone else does. As far as 
I have been able to ascertain, there is 
nothiflfe in text-books to indicate that 
starlings in Britain place ants beneath 
their wings. 

I have to add that I got the 
book in 1936 and must have read 
these paragraphs then, but that 
they evidently made no impres- 
sion on me, for I had to look them 
up later. 

Now the scene shifts to Wash- 
ington, D. C., where I lived for 
several years in a rented house 
on Rhode Island Avenue, the 
typical two-story one-family 
Washington home, with a front 
lawn and a back yard and big 
old trees all around. Also much 
birdlife, yellow finches and 
English sparrows, cardinals and 
catbirds, blue jays and starlings. 

16 



On a hot afternoon in late 
summer 1948, I sat on my front 
porch, reading, paying very little 
attention to the robins on the 
lawn. There were some more on 
my neighbor’s lawn and my 
neighbors, an old couple, paid as 
little attention to them as I did. 
Among the robins on their lawn 
was a young one which finally 
attracted notice by behaving 
queerly. It ran back and forth 
with short, quick steps, moved in 
a small circle with one wing and 
tail dragging on the grass, then 
tumbled and fell. It sat still, ap- 
parently exhausted. 

My neighbor went to pick the 
bird up, which he permitted her 
to do without a struggle. Nat- 
urally the woman assumed that 
the young bird was hurt. She 
looked unsuccessfully for a 
wound and then called my wife 
Olga to her, exclaiming: “The 
poor thing is all covered with 
ants.” The two women brushed 
the ants out of the feathers with 
a soft brush; the bird did not pro- 
test and sat quietly. 

Somewhat at a loss what to do 
next, they called me in. It was 
decided to perch the ' bird on 
top of the garage, out of reach 
of the cats of the neighborhood. 
The young robin stayed put for 
a few minutes, then walked to the 
rim of the garage’s roof, looked 
down with some curiosity, and 
suddenly flew away. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



■c 



It was at about that instant 
that Olga realized what we had 
seen. Just a few days earlier, a 
book by Frank W. Lane had ar- 
rived from England — it has been 
issued in Spring 1952 in the 
United States under the title 
Animal Wonder World — but I 
had as yet merely looked at it, 
my mind being on missiles, and 
Olga read it first. 

Lane told what had transpired 
since Chisholm had inserted that 
short statement in his book. A 
copy of Chisholm^s book had 
come to the University of Berlin 
and Prof. Erwin Stresemann had 
wondered whether the English 
starling had actually picked up 
a new habit in Australia. Strese- 
mann published a translation of 
Chisholm’s statement in the Ger- 
man Ornithological Monthly. He 
received an astonishing volume 
of mail, but because of the war 
this did not become known. 
Shortly after the war, Frank W. 
Lane published an article on this 
habit in the British magazine 
Country Life, whereupon he 
found himself at the receiving 
end of lots of letters. Scores of 
people have watched scores of 
birds put ants under their wings. 

The champion “anter” in 
England is a thrush; in America 
it seems to be the robin which, 
zoologically speaking, is also a 
thrush. H. R. Ivor in Canada de- 
cided that an aviary should be a 



convenient place to observe “ant- 
ing.” He was right. But other ob- 
servers, who made the same de- 
cision, did not see anything 
unusual happen. 

These are the ones who claim 
that it is all a superstition. Of 
course, their position is difficult, 
for it is much harder to prove 
that something does not happen 
than it is to prove that it does. 
And the ones who say it docs 
happen because they watched it 
happen number among them 
some people with a reputation to 
uphold. The American reports 
seem to indicate that thrushes, 
including robins, crows and star- 
lings seem especially addicted to 
“anting.” Blue jays and pigeons 
do not do it at all, it seems. 

The main question, since the 
fact can hardly be doubted, is 
“why?” Chisholm advanced the 
suggestion that the formic acid, 
sprayed into the feathers by the 
trapped ants, kills off parasites. 
He probably does not hold that 
opinion any more. Those birds 
which do not “ant” — ^which is 
most of them — have parasites, 
too. So far there is no definite 
answer. But several observers 
stressed “the evident enjoyment” 
of the birds and their exhaustion 
afterward. That, to me, sounds 
like a binge. On formic acid! 

Wish I had really watched that 
afternoon in Washington.

ANY QUESTIONS? 



Is it le^al to use the metric 
system in the United States? 

Not only did our Congress 
make the metric system legal 
in the United States in 1866, 
it also defined the inch and the 
foot in terms of centimeters, 
the mile in terms of kilometers 
and so on. In addition to that 
the weight of the coins were 
fixed in metrie weights, the 
nickel at 5 grams, the dime at 
2^4 ihe quarter at 

grams and the half dollar at 
12]/y grams. 

Is there such a term as '‘explo- 
sion lirrut” and what does it 
xnean^ 

I probably could give a belter 
answer if my correspondent 
had quoted the whole sentence 
or at least told me what he 
was reailing about. The term 
may refer to the limits of the 
danger area of an explosion, 
or it may refer to the admix* 
ture of explosive gases to the 
air of a closed room. If there 
is not enough of the explosive 
gas present, no explosions will 
occur. If there is too much, no 
explosion will occur either. 
These ‘‘explosion limits” vary 
widely for different explosive 
gases. Expressed in percentages 
of the available space, the val- 
ues for some substances are: 



Hydrogen 


9.4 


66.5 


Alcohol 


3.9 


13.7 


Marsh gas 


6.0 


13.0 


Ether 


2.6 


7.9 


Benzene 


2.6 


6.7 


HI. Gas 


7.8 


19.2 


These limits 


explain 


a few 



other things too. You can smell 
an admixture of illuminating 
gas to the air long before it 
has reached the lower limit. 
Conversely, the explosion limits 
for hydrogen are rather wide, 
which helps to make hydrogen 
leaks so dangerous. Those of 
carbon monoxide are even 
wider (16.4— 7,'5.1), but since 
the lower limit is high, poison- 
ing occurs long before there is 
danger of explosion. 

I wonder where the pilot and 
crew will iet the energy tor keep- 
ing warm in space. >ls long as 
the rocket is burning, some of 
that might be piped into the 
cabin, but I understand that in 
any space trip the rockets will 
burn for a short time only. 

Strangely enough, we now 
know that the main engineering 
problem will be to keep the 
cabin cool enough! Pll explain 
more about that in the main 
section of this department in 
the near future.

the face, even though it couldn’t 
hear. 

“Effie!” 

She knew what that last tone 
meaqj. Wearily she swung shut 
the ponderous lead inner shutters 
and drove home the heavy bolts. 
That hurt her fingers; it always 
did, but he mustn’t know that. 

“You know that those shutters 
are not to be touched! Not for 
five more years at least!” 

“I only wanted to look at the 
Moon,” she said, turning around, 
and then it was all gone — - 
the face, the night, the Moon, the 
magic — and she was back in the 
grubby, stale little hole, facing an 
angry, stale little man. It was 
then that the eternal thud of the 
air-conditioning fans and the 
crackle of the electrostatic pre- 
cipitators that sieved out the dust 
reached her consciousness again 



like the bite of a dentist’s drill. 

“Only wanted to look at the 
Moon!” he mimicked her in fal- 
setto. “Only wanted to die like a 
little fool and make me that much 
more ashamed of you!” Then his 
voice went gruff and professional. 
“Here, count yourself.” 

She silently took the Geiger 
Counter he held at arm’s length, 
waited until it settled down to a 
steady ticking slower than a 
clock — due only to cosmic rays 
and indicating nothing dangerous 
—and then began to comb her 
body with the instrument. First 
her head and shoulders, then out 
along her arms and back along 
their under side. There was some- 
thing oddly voluptuous about her 
movements, although her features 
were gray and sagging. 

The ticking did not change its 
tempo until she came to her 
waist. Then it suddenly spurted, 
clicking faster and faster. Her 
husband gave an excited grunt, 
took a quick step forward, froze. 
She goggled for a moment in 
fear, then grinned foolishly, dug 
in the pocket of her grimy apron 
and guiltily pulled out a wrist- 
watch. 

He grabbed it as it dangled 
from her fingers, saw that it had 
a radiurh dial, cursed, heaved it 
up as if to smash it on the floor, 
but instead put it carefully on 
the table. 

"You imbecile, you incredible 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



imbecile,” he softly chnnted to 
himself through clenched teeth, 
with eyes half closed. 

She shrugged faintly, put the 
Geiger Counter on the table, and 
stood there slumped. 

He waited until the chanting 
had soothed his anger before 
speaking again. He said quietly, 
'‘I do suppose you still realize 
the sort of world you’re living 
in?” 

S HE nodded slowly, staring at 
nothingness. Oh, she realized, 
all right, realized only too well. 
It was the world that hadn’t 
realized. The world that had gone 
on stockpiling hydrogen bombs. 
The world that had put those 
bombs in cobalt shells, although 
it had promised it wouldn’t, be- 
cause the cobalt made them much 
more terrible and cost no more. 
The world that had started 
throwing those bombs, always 
telling itself that it hadn’t thrown 
enough of them yet to make the 
air really dangerous with the 
deadly radioactive dust that came 
from the cobalt. Thrown them 
and kept on throwing until the 
danger point, where air and 
ground would become fatal to all 
human life, was approached. 

Then, for about a month, the 
two great enemy groups had hesi- 
tated. And then each, unknown to 
the other, had decided it could 
risk one last gigantic and decisive 

THE MOON IS GREEN 



attack without exceeding the 
danger point. It had been planned 
to strip off the cobalt cases, but 
somqpne forgot and then there 
wasn’t time. Besides, the military, 
scientists of each group were con- 
fident that the lands of the other 
had got the most dust. The two 
attacks came within an hour of 
each other. 

After that, the Fury. The Fury 
of doomed men who think only of 
taking with them as many as pos- 
sibl| of the enemy, and in this 
case — they hoped — all. The Fury 
of suicides who know they have 
botched up life for good. The 
Fury of cocksure men who realize 
they have been outsmarted by 
fate, the enemy, and themselves, 
and know that they will never be 
able to improvise a defense when 
arraigned before the high court of 
history — and whose unadmitted 
hope is that there will be no high 
court of history left to arraign 
them. More cobalt bombs were 
dropped during the Fury than 
in all the preceding years of the 
war. 

After the Fury, the Terror. 
Men and women with death sift- 
ing into their bones through their 
nostrils and skin, fighting for bare 
survival under a dust-hazed sky 
that played fantastic tricks with 
the light of Sun and Moon, like 
the dust from Krakatoa that 
drifted around the world For 
years. Cities, countryside, and air 



91 



were alike poisoned, alive with 
deadly radiation. 

The only realistic chance for 
continued existence was to re- 
tire, for the five or ten years the 
radiation would remain deadly, 
to some well-sealed and radia- 
tion-shielded place that must also 
be copiously supplied with food, 
water, power, and a means of air- 
conditioning. 

Such places were prepared by 
the far-seeing, seized by the 
stronger, defended by them in 
turn against the desperate hordes 
of the dying . until there were 
no more of those. 

After that, only the waiting, the 
enduring. A mole’s existence, 
without beauty or tenderness, but' 
with^ear and guilt as constant 
companions. Never to see the 
Sun, to walk among the trees — 
or even know if there were still 
trees. 

Oh, yes, she realized what the 
world was like. 

OU understand, too, I sup- 
pose, that we were allowed 
to reclaim this ground-level apart- 
ment only because the Commit- 
tee believed us to be responsible 
people, and because I’ve been 
making a damn good showing 
lately?” 

“Yes, Hank.” 

“I thought you were eager for 
privacy. You want to go back to 
the basement tenements?” 



God, no! Anything rather than 
that fetid huddling, that shame- 
less communal sprawl. And yet, 
was this so much better? The 
nearness to the surface was 
meaningless; it only tantalized. 
And the privacy magnified Hank. 

She shook her head dutifully 
and said, “No, Hank.” 

“Then why aren’t you careful? 
I’ve told you a million times, 
Effie, that glass is no protection 
against the dust that’s outside 
that window. The lead shutter 
must never be touched! If you 
make one single slip like that 
and it gets around, the Commit- 
tee will send us back to the lower 
levels without blinking an eye. 
And they’ll think twice before 
tiTiStiftg me with any important 
jobs.” 

“I’m sorry, Hank.” 

“Sorry? What’s the good of be- 
ing sorry? The only thing that 
counts is never to make a slip! 
Why the devil do you do such 
things, Effie? What drives you to 
it?” 

She swallowed. “It’s just that 
it’s so dreadful being cooped* up 
like this.” she said hesitatingly, 
“shut away from the sky and the 
Sun. I’m just hungry for a little 
beauty.” 

“And do you suppose I’m not?” 
he demanded. “Don’t you sup- 
pose I want to get outside, too, 
and be carefree and have a good 
time? But I’m not so damn selfish

about it. I want my children to 
enjoy the Sun, and my children’s 
children. Don’t you see that that’s 
the all-important thing and that 
we have to behave like mature 
adults and make sacrifices for it?” 

“Yes, Hank.” 

He surveyed her slumped fig- 
ure, her lined and listless face. 
“You’re a fine one to talk about 
hunger for beauty,” he told her. 
Then his voice grew softer, more 
deliberate. “You haven’t forgot- 
ten, have you, Eflie, that until 
last month the Committee was 
so concerned about your sterility? 
That they were about to enter 
my name on the list of those 
waiting to be allotted a free 
woman? Very high on the list, 
too!” 

She could nod even at that one, 
but not while looking at him. 
She turned away. She knew very 
well that the Committee was jus- 
tified in worrying about the birth 
rate. When the community finally 
moved back to the surface again, 
each additional healthy young 
person would be an asset, not 
only in the struggle 'for bare sur- 
vival, but in the resumed war 
against Communism which some 
of the Committee members still 
counted on. 

It was natural that they should 
view a sterile woman with dis- 
favor, and not only because of 
the waste of her husband’s germ- 
plasm, but because sterility might

indicate that she had suffered 
more than the average from radi- 
ation. In that case, if she did bear 
children later on, they would be 
more apt to carry a defective 
heredity, producing an undue 
number of monsters and freaks in 
future generations, and so con- 
taminating the . race. 

Of course she understood it. 
She could hardly remember the 
time when she didn’t. Years ago? 
Centuries? There wasn’t much 
difference in a place where time 
was endless, 

TTIS lecture finished, her hus- 
band smiled and grew almost 
cheerful, 

“Now that you’re going to have 
a child, that’s all in the back- 
ground again. Do you know, Ef- 
fie, that when I first came in, I 
had some very good news for 
you? I’m to become a member of 
the Junior Committee and the 
announcement will be made at 
the banquet tonight.” He cut 
short her mumbled congratula- 
tions. “So brighten yourself up 
and put on your best dress. I 
want the other Juniors to see 
what a handsome wife the new 
member has got.” He paused. 
“Well, get a move on!” 

She spoke with difficulty, still 
not looking at him. “I’m terribly 
sorry, Hank, but you’ll have to 
go alone. I’m not well.” 

He straightened up with an in- 

40 



dignant jerk. “There you go 
again! First that infantile, in- 
excusable business of the shut- 
ters. and now this! No feeling for 
my reputation at all. Don’t be 
ridiculous, Efhe. You’re coming!” 
“Terribly sorry,” she repeated 
blindly, “but I really can’t. I’d 
just be sick. I wouldn’t make you 
proud of me at all.” 

“Of course you won’t,” he re- 
torted sharply. “As it is, I have 
to spend half my energy running 
around making excuses for you 
——why you’re so odd, why you 
always seem to be ailing, why 
you’re always stupid and snob- 
bish and say the wrong thing. But 
tonight’s really important, Effie. 
It will cause a lot of bad corn- 
met^ if the new member’s wife 
isn’t present. You know how just 
a hint of sickness starts the old 
radiation-disease rumor going. 
You’ve got to come, Effie.” 

She shook her head helplessly. 
“Oh. for heaven’s sake, come 
on!” he shouted, advancing on 
her. “This is just a silly mood. 
As soon as you get going, you’ll 
snap out of it. There’s nothing 
really wrong with you at all.” 

He put his hand on her shoul- 
der to turn her around, and at 
his touch her face suddenly grew 
so desperate and gray that for a 
moment he was alarmed in spite 
of himself. 

“Really?” he asked, almost 
with a note of concern. 



She nodded miserably. 

“Hmm!” He stepped back and 
strode about irresolutely. “Well, 
of course, if that’s the way it is 
, . He checked himself and a 
sad smile crossed his face. “So 
you don’t care enough about your 
old husband’s success to make 
one supreme effort in spite of feel- 
ing bad?" 

Again the helpless headshake. 
“I just can’t go out tonight, un- 
der any circumstances.” And her 
gaze stole toward the lead 
shutters. 

He was about to say something 
when he caught the direction of 
her gaze. His eyebrows jumped. 
For seconds he stared at her in- 
credulously, as if some completely 
new and almost unbelievable 
possibility had popped into his 
mind. The look of incredulity 
slowly faded, to be replaced by 
a harder, more calculating expres- 
sion. But when he spoke again, 
his voice was shockingly bright 
and kind. 

“Well, it can’t be helped nat- 
urally, and I certainly wouldn’t 
want you to go if you weren’t 
able to enjoy it. So you hop right 
into bed and get a good rest. I’ll 
run over to the men’s dorm to 
freshen up, No, really, I don’t 
want you to have to make any 
effort at all. Incidentally. Jim 
Barnes isn’t going to be able to 
come to the banquet either — 
touch of the old ’flu, he tells me,

of all things.” 

He watched her closely as he 
mentioned the other man’s name, 
‘ but she didn’t react noticeably. 
In fact, she hardly seemed to be 
hearing his chatter. 

. “I got a bit sharp with you, 

I’m afraid, Effie,” he continued 
contritely. “I’m sorry about that. 
I was excited about my new job 
and I guess that was why things 
upset me. Made me feel let down 
when I found you weren’t feel- 
ing as good as I was. Selfish of 
me. Now you get into bed right 
away and get well. Don’t worry 
about me a bit. I know you’d 
come if you possibly could. And 
I know you’ll be thinking about 
me. Well, I must be off now.” 

He started toward her, as if to 
embrace her, then seemed to 
think better of it. He turned back 
at the doorway and said, empha- 
sizing the words, “You’ll be com- 
pletely alone for the next four 
hours.” He waited for her nod, 
then bounced out. 

OHE stood still until his foot- 
^ steps died away. Then she 
straightened up, walked over to 
where he’d put down the wrist- 
b watch, picked it up and smashed 
it hard on the floor. The crystal 
shattered, the case flew apart, and 
something went zing! 

She stood there breathing 
heavily. Slowly her sagged fea- 
tures lifted, formed themselves 



into the beginning of a smile. 
She stole another look at the 
shutters. The smile became more 
definite. She felt her hair, wet 
her fingers and ran them along 
her hairline and back over her 
ears. After wiping her hands on 
her apron, she took it off. She 
straightened her dress, lifted her 
head with a little flourish, and 
stepped smartly toward the 
window. 

Then her face went miserable 
again and her steps slowed. 

No, it couldn’t be, and it won’t 
be, she told herself. It had been 
just an illusion, a silly romantic 
dream that she had somehow 
projected out of her beauty- 
starved mind and given a mo- 
ment’s false reality. There 
couldn’t be anjrthing alive out- 
side. There hadn’t been for two 
whole years. 

And if there conceivably were, 
it would be something altogether 
horrible. She remembered some 
of the pariahs — hairless, witless 
creatures, with radiation welts 
crawling over their bodies like 
worms, who had come begging 
for succor during the last months 
of the Terror — and been shot 
down. How they must have hated 
the people in refuges! 

But even as she was thinking 
these things, her fingers were ca- 
ressing the bolts, gingerly draw- 
ing them, and she was opening the 
shutters gently, apprehensively. 



THE MOON IS GREEN 



9 $ 



No, there couldn’t be anything 
outside, she assured herself 
wryly, peering out into the green 
night. Even her fears had been 
groundless. 

But the face came floating up 
toward the window. She started 
back in terror, then checked her- 
self. 

For the face wasn’t horrible at 
all, only very thin, with full lips 
and large eyes and a thin proud 
nose like the jutting beak of a 
bird. And no radiation welts or 
scars marred the skin, olive in 
the tempered moonlight. It 
looked, in fact, just as it had 
when she had seen it the first 
time. 

For a long moment the face 
stared deep, deep into her brain. 
Then the full lips smiled and a 
half-clenched, thin-fingered hand 
materialized itself from the green 
darkness and rapped twice on the 
grimy pane. 

Her heart pounding, she furi- 
ously worked the little crank that 
opened the window. It came un- 
stuck from the frame with a 
tiny explosion of dust and a zin^ 
like that of the watch, only 
louder. A moment later it swung 
open wide and a puff of incred- 
ibly fresh air caressed her face 
and the inside of her nostrils, 
stinging her eyes with unantici- 
pated tears. 

The man outside balanced on 
the sill, crouching like a faun, 



head high, one elbow on knee. 
He was dressed in scarred, snug 
trousers and an old sweater. 

“Is it tears I get for a wel- 
come?” he mocked her gently in 
a musical voice. “Or are those 
only to greet God’s own breath, 
the air?” 

T¥E swung down inside and 
now she could see he was tall. 
Turning, he snapped his fingers 
and called, “Come, puss.” 

A black cat with a twisted 
stump of a tail and feet like small 
boxing gloves and ears almost as 
big as rabbits’ hopped clumsily 
in view. He lifted it down, gave it 
a pat. Then, nodding familiarly 
to Effie, he unstrapped a little 
pack from his back and laid it 
on the table. 

She couldn’t move. She even 
found it hard to breathe. 

“The window,” she finally man- 
aged to get out. 

He looked at her inquiringly, 
caught the direction of her stab- 
bing finger. Moving without 
haste, he went over and closed it 
carelessly. 

“The shutters, too,” she told 
him, but he ignored that, look- 
ing around. 

“It’s a snug enough place you 
and your man have,” he com- 
mented. “Or is it that this is a 
free-love town or a harem spot, or 
just a military post?” He checked 
her before she could answer. “But

let’s not be talking about such 
tilings now. Soon enough I’ll be 
scared to death for both of us. 
Best enjoy the kick of meeting, 
which is always good for twenty 
minutes at the least.” He smiled 
at her rather shyly. “Have you 
food? Good, then bring it.” 

She set cold meat and some 
precious canned bread before him 
and had water heating for coffee. 
Before he fell to, he shredded a 
chunk of meat and put it on the 
floor for the cat. which left off 
its sniffing inspection of the walls 
and ran up eagerly mewing. Then 
the man began to eat. chewing 
each mouthful slowly and appre- 
ciatively. 

From across the table Effie 
watched him, drinking in his 
every deft movement, his every 
cryptic quirk of expression. She 
attended to making the coffee, 
but that took only a moment. 
Finally she could contain herself 
no longer. 

“What’s it like up there?” she 
asked breathlessly. “Outside, I 
mean.” 

He looked at her oddly for 
quite a space. Finally, he said 
flatly. “Oh, it’s a wonderland for 
sure, more amazing than you 
tombed folk could ever imagine. 
A veritable fairyland.” And he 
quickly went on eating. 

“No, but really,” she pressed. 

Noting her eagerness, he smiled 
and his eyes filled with playful 



tenderness. “I mean it, on my 
oath,” he assured her. “You think 
the bombs and the dust made 
only death and ugliness. That 
was true at first. But then, just 
as the doctors foretold, they 
changed the life in the seeds and 
loins that were brave enough to 
stay. Wonders bloomed and 
walked.” He broke off suddenly 
and asked, “Do any of you ever 
venture outside?” 

“A few of the men are allowed 
to,” she told him, “for short trips 
in special protective suits, to hunt 
for canned food and fuels and 
batteries and things like that.’* 
“Aye, and those blind-souled 
slugs would never see anything 
but what they’re looking for,” he 
said, nodding bitterly. “They’d 
never see the garden where a 
dozen buds blossom wherfe one 
did before, and the flowers have 
petals a yard across, with sting- 
less bees big as sparrows gently 
supping their nectar. Housccats 
grown spotted and huge as leop- 
ards (not little runts like Joe 
Louis here) stalk through those 
gardens. But they’re gentle beasts, 
no more harmful than the rain- 
bow-scaled snakes that glide 
around their paws, for the dust 
burned all the murder out of 
them, as it burned itself out. 

“I’ve even made up a little 
poem about that. It starts, ‘Fire 
can hurt me, or water, or .the 
weight of-Earth. But the dust is

my friend.’ Oh, yes, and then the 
robins like cockatoos and squir- 
rels like a princess’s ermine! All 
under a treasure chest of Sun and 
Moon and stars that the dust’s 
magic powder changes from ruby 
to emerald and sapphire and 
amethyst and back again. Oh, 
and then the new children — ” 

“You’re telling the truth?” she 
interrupted him, her eyes brim- 
ming with tears. “You’re not 
making it up?” 

“I am not,” he assured her 
solemnly. “And if you could catch 
a glimpse of one of the new chil- 
dren, you’d never doubt me again. 
They have long limbs as brown 
as this coffee would be if it had 
lots of fresh cream in it, and 
smiling delicate faces and the 
whitish teeth and the finest hair. 
They’re so nimble that I — a 
sprightly man and somewhat en- 
livened by the dust — feel like a 
cripple beside them. And their 
thoughts dance like flames and 
make me feel a very imbecile. 

“Of course, they have seven 
fingers on each hand and eight 
toes on each foot, but they’re the 
more beautiful for that. They 
have large pointed ears that the 
Sun shines through. They play 
in the garden, all day long, slip- 
ping among the great leaves and 
blooms, but they’re so swift that 
you can hardly see them, unless 
one chooses to stand still and look 
at you. For that matter, you have 



to look a bit hard for all these 
things I’m telling you.” 

“But it is true?” she pleaded. 

“Every word of it,” he said, 
looking straight into her eyes. He 
put down his knife and fork. 
“What’s ,your name?” he asked 
softly. “Mine’s Patrick.” 

“Effiie,” she told him. 

He shook his head. “That can’t 
be,” he said. Then his face 
brightened. “Euphemia,” he ex- 
claimed. “That’s what Effie is 
short for. Your name is Euphe- 
mia.” As he said that, looking 
at her, she suddenly felt beautiful. 
He got up and came around the 
table and stretched out his hand 
toward her. 

“Euphemia — ” he began. 

“Yes?” she answered huskily, 
shrinking from him a little, but 
'looking Up sideways, and very 
flushed. 

“Don’t either of you move,” 
Hank said. 

The voice was flat and nasal 
because Hank was wearing a nose 
respirator that was just long 
enough to suggest an elephant’s 
trunk. In his right hand was a 
large blue-black automatic pistol. 

ri^HEY turned their faces to 
him. Patrick’s was abruptly 
alert, shifty. But Effle’s was still 
smiling tenderly, as if Hank could 
not break the spell of the magic 
garden and should be p’tied for 
not knowing about it.

“You little — ” Hank began 
with an almost gleeful fury, call- 
ing her several shameful names. 
He spoke in short phrases, clos- 
ing tight his unmasked mouth be- 
tween them while he sucked in 
breath through the respirator. His 
voice rose in a crescendo. “And 
not with a man of the community, 
but a pariah! A pariahf” 

“I hardly know what you’re 
thinking, man, but you’re quite 
wrong,” Patrick took the oppor- 
tunity to put in hurriedly, con- 
ciliatingly. “I just happened to 
be coming by hungry tonight, a 
lonely tramp, and knocked at the 
window. Your wife was a bit 
foolish and let kindheartedness 
get the better of prudence — ” 

‘‘Don’t think you’ve pulled the 
wool over my eyes, Efiie,” Hank 
went on with a screechy laugh, 
disregarding the other man com- 
pletely. ‘‘Don’t think I don’t 
know why you’re suddenly going 
to have a child after four long 
years.” 

At that moment the cat came 
nosing up to his feet. Patrick 
watched him narrowly, shifting 
his weight forward a little, but 
Hank only kicked the animal 
aside without taking his eyes 
off them, 

‘‘Even that business of carry- 
ing the wristwatch in your pocket 
instead of on your arm,” he went 
on with channeled hysteria. “A 
neat bit of camouflage, Effie. Very 



neat. And telling me it was my 
child, when all the while you’ve 
been seeing him for months!” 

‘‘Man, you’re mad; I’ve not 
touched her!” Patrick denied 
hotly though still calculatingly, 
and risked a step forward, stop- 
ping when' the gun instantly 
swung his way. 

“Pretending you were going to 
give me a healthy child,” Hank 
raved on. “when all the while 
you knew it would be — either in 
body or germ plasm — a thing like 
f/iaf!” 

He waved his gun at the mal- 
formed cat, which had leaped to 
the top of the table and was eat- 
ing the remains of Patrick’s food, 
though its watchful green eyes 
were fixed on Hank. 

“I should shoot him down!” 
Hank yelled, between sobbing, 
chest-racking inhalations through 
the mask. “I should kill him this 
instant for the contaminated 
pariah he is!” 

All this while Effie had not 
ceased to smile compassionately. 
Now she stood up without haste 
and went to Patrick's side. Dis- 
regarding his warning, apprehen- 
sive glance, she put her arm 
lightly around him and faced her 
husband. 

“Then you’d be killing the 
bringer of the best news we’ve 
ever had,” she said, and her 
voice was like a flood of some 
warm sweet liquor in that miisty.

hate-charged room. “Oh, Hank, 
forget' your silly^ wrong jealousy 
and listen to me. Patrick here has 
something wonderful to tell us.” 

H ank stared at her. For once 
he screamed no reply.. It 
was obvious that he was seeing 
for the first time how beautiful 
she had become, and that the 
realization jolted him terribly. 

“What do you mean?” he fi- 
nally asked unevenly, almost 
fearfully. 

“I mean that we no longer need 
to fear the dust,” she said, and 
now her smile was radiant. “It 
never really did hurt people the 
way the doctors said it would. 
Remember how it was with me, 
HanJ^, the exposure I had and re- 
covered from, although the doc- 
tors said I wouldn’t at first — 
and without even losing my hair? 
Hank, those who were brave 
enough to stay outside, and who 
weren’t killed by terror and sug- 
gestion and panic — they adapted 
to the dust. They changed, but 
they changed for the better. Ev- 
erything — ” 

“Effie, he told you lies!” Hank 
interrupted, but still in that same 
agitated, broken voice, cowed^by 
her beauty. 

“Everything that grew or 
moved was purified,” she went 
on ringingly. “You men going 
outside have never seen it, be- 
cause you’ve never had eyes for 



it You’ve been blinded to beauty, 
to life itself. And now all the 
power in the dust has gone and 
faded, anyway, burned itself out. 
That’s true, isn’t it?” 

She smiled at Patrick for con- 
firmation. His face was strangely 
veiled, as if he were calculating 
obscure changes. He might have 
given a little nod; at any rate, 
Effie assumed that he did, for 
she turned back to her husband. 

“You see, Hank? We can all 
go out now. We need never fear 
the dust again. Patrick is a liv- 
ing proof of that,” she continued 
triumphantly, 'standing straighter, 
holding him a little tighter. “Look 
at him. Not a scar or a sign, and 
he’s been out in the dust for 
years. How could he be this way, 
if the dust hurt the brave? Oh, 
believe me, Hank! Believe what 
you see. Test it if you want. Test 
Patrick here.” 

“Effie, you’re all mixed up. 
You don’t know — Hank fal- 
tered, but without conviction of 
any sort. 

“Just test him.” Effie repeated 
with utter confidence, ignoring— 
not even noticing — Patrick’s 
warning nudge. 

“All right,” Hank mumbled. 
He looked at the stranger dully. 
‘‘Can you count?” he asked. 

Patrick’s face was a complete 
enigma. Then he suddenly spoke, 
and his voice was like a fencer’s 
foil — light, bright, alert, con- 



100

stantly playing, yet utterly on 
guard. 

“Can I count? Do you take me 
for a complete simpleton, man? 
Of course I can count!” 

“Then count yourself,” Hank 
said, barely indicating the table. 

“Count myself, should I?” the 
other retorted with a quick fa- 
cetious laugh. “Is this a kinder- 
garten? But if you want me to, 
I’m willing.” His voice was rapid. 
“I’ve two arms, and two legs, 
that’s four. And ten fingers and 
ten toes — you’ll take my word for 
them? — that’s twenty-four. A 
head, twenty-five. And two eyes 
and a nose and a mouth — ” 
“With this, I mean,” Hank said 
heavily, advanced to the table, 
picked up the Geiger counter, 
switched it on, and handed it 
across the table to the other man. 

But while it was still an arm’s 
length from Patrick, the clicks 
began to mount furiously, Until 
they were like the chatter of a 
pigmy machine gun. Abruptly 
the clicks slowed, but that was 
only the counter shifting to a 
new scaling circuit, in which each 
click stood for 512 of the old 
ones. 

W ITH those horrid, rattling 
little volleys, fear cascaded 
into the room and filled it, smash- 
ing like so much colored glass all 
the bright barriers of words Effie 
had raised against it. For no 



dreams can stand against the 
Geiger counter, the Twentieth 
Century’s mouthpiece of ultimate 
truth. It was as if the dust and 
all the terrors of the dust had in- 
carnated themselves in one dread 
invading shape that said in words 
Stronger than audible speech, 
“Those were illusions, whistles in 
the dark. This is reality, the 
dreary, pitiless reality of the 
Burrowing Years.” 

Hank scuttled back to the wall. 
Through chattering teeth he 
babbled, “. enough radio- 
actives . kill a thousand men 
. freak ... a freak . .” In 
his agitation he forgot for a mo- 
ment to inhale through the res- 
pirator. 

Even Effie — taken off guard, 
all the fears that had been drilled 
into her twanging like piano 
wires — shrank from the skeletal- 
seeming shape beside her, held 
herself to it only by desperation. 

Patrick did it for her. He dis- 
■ engaged her arm and stepped 
briskly away. Then he whirled on 
them, smiling sardonically, and 
started to speak, but instead 
looked with distaste at the chat- 
tering Geiger counter he held be- 
tween fingers and thumb. 

“Have we listened to this racket 
long enough?” he asked. 

Without waiting for an answer, 
he put down the instrument on 
the table. The cat hurried over 
to it curiously and the clicks be-

gan again to mount in a minor 
crescendo. Eflie lunged for it 
frantically, switched it off, darted 
back. 

“That’s right,” Patrick said 
with another chilling smile. “You 
do well to cringe, for I’m death 
itself. Even in death I could kill 
you, like a snake.” And with that 
his voice took on the tones of a 
circus barker. “Yes, I’m a' freak, 
as the gentleman so wisely said. 
That’s what one doctor who 
dared talk with me for a minute 
told me before he kicked me out. 
He couldn't tell me why, but 
somehow the dust doesn’t kill me. 
Because I’m a freak, you see, just 
like the men who ate nails and 
walked on fire and ate arsenic 
and ^tuck themselves through 
with pins. Step right up, ladies 
and gentlemen — only not too 
close! — and examine the man the 
dust can't harm. Rappacini’s 
child, brought up to date; his 
embrace, death! 

“And now,” he said, breathing 
heavily, “I'll get out and leave 
you in your damned lead cave.” 

He started toward the window. 
Hank’s gun followed him shak- 
ingly. 

“Wait!” Effie called in an 
agonized voice. He obeyed. She 
continued falteringly, “When we 
were together earlier, you didn’t 
act as if . 

“When we were together ear- 
lier, I wanted what I wanted,” 



he snarled at her. “You don’t sup- 
pose I'm a bloody saint, do you?” 

“And all the beautiful things 
you told me?” 

“That,” he said cruelly, “is just 
a line I’ve found that women 
fall for. They’re all so bored and 
so starved for beauty — as they 
generally put it.” 

“Even the garden?” Her ques- 
tion was barely audible through- 
the sobs that threatened to suf- 
focate her. 

He looked at her and perhaps 
his expression softened just a 
trifle. 

“What’s outside.” he said flatly, 
“is just a little worse than either 
of you can imagine.” He tapped 
his temple. “The garden’s all 
here.” 

“You’ve killed it,” she wept. 
“You’ve killed it in me. You’ve 
both killed everything that’s 
beautiful. But you’re worse,” she 
screamed at Patrick, “because he 
only killed beauty once, but you 
brought it to life just so you 
could kill it again. Oh, I can’t 
stand it! I won’t stand it!” And 
she began to scream. 

Patrick started toward her, but 
she broke off and whirled away 
from him to the window, her eyes 
crazy. 

“You’ve been lying to us,” she 
cried. “The garden’s there. I know 
it is. But you don’t want to share 
it with anyone.” 

“No. no, Euphemia,” Patrick

protested anxiously. “It’s hell out 
there, believe me. 1 wouldn’t lie 
to you about it.” 

“Wouldn’t lie to me!” she 
mocked. “Are you afraid, too?” 
With a sudden pull, she jerked 
open the window and stood be- 
fore the blank green-tinged ob- 
long of darkness that seemed to 
press into the room like a menac- 
ing, heavy, wind-urged curtain. 

At that Hank cried out 
a shocked, pleading, “Effie!” 

She ignored him. “I can’t be 
cooped up here any longer,” she 
said. “And I won’t, now that I 
know. I’m going to the garden.” 
Both men sprang at her, but 
they were too late. She leaped 
lightly to the sill, and by the 
time they had flung themselves 
against it, her footsteps were al- 
ready hurrying off into the dark- 
ness. 

“Effie, come back! Come 
back!” Hank shouted after her 
desperately, no longer thinking 
to cringe from the man beside 
him, or how the gun was pointed. 
“I love you, Effie. Come back!” 
Patrick added his voice. “Come 
back, Euphemia. You’ll be safe 
if you come back right away. 
Come back to your home.” 

No answer to that at all. 
They both strained their eyes 
through the greenish murk. They 
could barely make out a shadowy 
figure about half a block down 
the near-black canyon of the 



dismal, dust-blown street, into 
which the greenish moonlight 
hardly reached. It seemed to 
them that the figure was scooping 
something up from the pavement 
and letting it sift down along its 
arms and over its bosom. 

“Go out and get her. man,” 
Patrick urged the other. “For if I 
I go out for her, I warn you I 
won’t bring her back. She said 
something about having stood the 
dust better than most, and that’s 
enough for me.” 

But Hank, chained by his 
painfully learned habits and by 
something else, could not move. 

And then a ghostly voice came 
whispering down the street, 
chanting, “Fire can hurt me, or 
water, or the weight of the Earth. 
But the dust is my friend.” 
.Patrick spared the other man 
one more look. Then, without a 
word, he vaulted up and ran off. 

Hank stood there. After per- 
haps a half minute he remem- 
bered to close his mouth when he 
inhaled. Finally he was sure the 
street was empty. As he started 
to close the window, there was a 
little mew. 

He picked up the cat and 
gently put It outside. Then he 
did close the window, and the 
shutters, and bolted them, and 
took up the Geiger counter, and 
mechanically began to count 
himself.

martians never die 



By LUCIUS DANIEL 

If was a wonderful bodyguard: 
no bark, no bite, no sting . • . 
just conversion of the enemy! 



A T three-fifteen, a young man 
walked into the circular 
/ m brick building and took 
a flattened package of cigarettes 
from his shirt pocket. 

“Mr. Stern?” he asked, throw- 
ing away the empty package. 

Stern looked with hard eyes at 
the youthful reporter. He recog- 
nized the type. 

“So they’re sending around 
cubs now,” he said. 

“I’m no cub — I’vd been on the 
paper a whole year,” the reporter 
protested, and then stopped, 



realizing his annoyance had 
betrayed him. 

“Only a year. The first time 
they sent their best man.” 

“This ain’t the first time,” said 
the young man, assuming a bored 
look. “It’s the fourth time, and 
next year I don’t think anybody 
will come at all. Why should 
they?” 

“Why, because they might be 
able to make it,” Beryl spoke up. 
"Something must have happened 
before.” 

Stem watched the reporter 



illusfrafed by WILIER

drink in Beryl’s loveliness. 

“Well, Mrs. Curtis.” the young 
man said, “everyone has it figured 
out that Dr. Curtis got stuck in 
the fourth dimension, or else lost, 
or died, maybe. Even Einstein 
can’t work out the stellar currents 
your husband was depending on.” 
“It’s very simple.” replied 
Beryl, “but I can’t explain it in- 
telligibly. I wish you could have 
talked to Dr. Curtis.” 

“Why is it that we have to 
come out here just once a year to 
wait for him? Is that how the 
fourth dimension works?” 

“It’s the only time when the 
stellar currents permit the trip 
back to Earth. And it’s not the 
fourth dimension! Clyde was al- 
ways irritated when anyone 
would talk about his traveling to 
Mars in the fourth dimension." 

“It’s interdimensional,” Stern 
put in. 

“And you’re his broker?” asked 
the reporter, throwing his ciga- 
rette down on the brick floor and 
stepping on it. “You’re his old 
friend from college days, handled 
his financial affairs, and helped 
him raise enough money to build 
his machine?” 

“Yes," Stem replied, a little 
pompously. “It was through my 
efforts that several wealthy men 
took an interest in the machine, 
so that Dr. Curtis did not have to 
bear the entire expense himself.” 
“Yeah, yeah,” the reporter 



sighed. “I read an old story on 
it before I came here. Now I’m 
out of cigarettes.” He looked 
hopefully at Stern. 

Stern returned the look coldly. 
“There’s a store where you can 
buy some about three blocks 
down the road.” 

“Is that the room where he's 
expected to materialize with his 
machine?” The reporter pointed 
to an inner door. 

“Yes. Dr. Curtis wanted to be 
sure no one would be injured. 
This inner circular room was 
built first; then he had the outer 
wall put up as an added pre- 
caution. The circular passageway 
we're in leads all around the old 
room, but this doorway is the 
only entrance.” 

“And what are those holes in 
the top of the door for?” 

“If he returns, we can tell by 
the displaced air rushing out. 
Then the door will open auto- 
matically.” 

“And when is the return sched- 
uled for?” asked the reporter. 

“Three-forty-seven and twen- 
ty-nine seconds.” 

“If it happens,” the reporter 
added skeptically. “And if it 
doesn’t, wc have to wait another 
year.” 

“Optimum conditions occur 
just once a year.” 

“Well, I’m going out to get 
some cigarettes. I've got time . 
and probably nothing to wait 



106

for. I’ll return though.” 

He walked briskly through the 
outer door. 

T his is the hardest part of 
the year, especially now. 
Suppose he did come back,” 
Beryl said plaintively. 

‘‘You don’t have to worry,” 
Stern assured her. “Clyde himself 
said that if he didn’t come back 
the second year, he might not 
make it at all.” Stern opened his 
gold case now and offered Beryl 
a cigarette. 

She shook her head. “But he 
made two trial runs in it first and 
came back.” 

“That was for a short distance 
only — that is, a short distance 
astronomically. Figuring for 
Mars was another story. Maybe 
he missed the planet and . .” 
“Oh, don’t! It’s just not know- 
ing that I can’t stand.” 

“Well,” he said drily, “we’ll 
know in — ” He stopped' and 
looked at his wristwatch — “in 
just about fifteen minutes.” 

“I can’t wait,” she moaned. 

He put his arm around her. 
“Relax. Take it easy and stop 
worrying. It’ll just be like last 
time.” 

“Not the last time at all. We 
hadn’t — ” 

“As soon as we are able to 
leave here,” he said, drawing her 
close and squee2ing her gently, 
“I’ll take steps to have him de- 

MARTIANS NEVER DIE 



dared legally dead. Then we’ll 
get married.” 

“That’s not much of a pro- 
posal,” she smiled. “But I guess 
I’ll have to accept you. You have 
Clyde’s power of attorney.” 

“And we’ll be rich. Richer than 
ever. I’ll be able to use some of 
my own ideas about the invest- 
ments. As a matter of fact, I 
have already.” And he frowned 
slightly. 

‘We have enough,” Beryl said 
quickly. “Don’t try to speculate. 
You know how Clyde felt about 
that.” 

“But he spent so damned much 
on the machine. I had to make 
back those expenses somehow.” 

Steps sounded outside and they 
drew apart. The reporter came in 
with a companion of about his 
own age. 

“Better wipe the lipstick off,” 
he grinned. “It’s almost time for 
something to happen.” 

Stern dabbed at his mouth an- 
grily with his handkerchief. 

At first the sound was so soft 
that it could hardly be heard, but 
soon a whistling grew until it 
became a threat to the eardrums. 
The reporters looked at each 
other with glad, excited eyes. 

The whistling stopped abruptly 
and, slowly, the door opened. The 
reporters rushed in immediately. 

Beryl gripped Stern’s hand con- 
vulsively. “He’s come back.”' 

“Yes, but that mustn’t change 



107 



oar plans, Beryl dear,” 

“But, AI . Oh, why were we 
so foolish?” 

“Not foolish, dear. Not at all 
foolish. Now we have to go in.” 

Inside the room was the large 
sphere of metalloy. It had lost its 
original gleam and was stained 
and battered, standing silent, 
closed, enigmatic. 

“Where’s the door?” called the 
first rejjorter. 

The sphere rested on a number 
of metal stilts, reaching out from 
the lower hemisphere, which held 
it about three feet from the floor, 
like a great pincushion turned 
upside down. 

Slowly, a round section the 
sphere’s wall swung outward and 
steps^escended. As they touched 
the floor, both reporters, caught 
by the same idea, sprinted for it 
and fought to see which would 
climb it first. 

“Wait!” shouted Stern. 

The reporters stopped their 
scuffling and followed Stern’s 
gaze. 

SOMETHING old and leathery 
and horrible was emerging 
from the circular doorway. Sev- 
eral tentacles, like so many 
snakes, slid around the hand rail 
which ran down the steps. Then, 
at the top. it paused. 

Stem felt an immediate and 
unreasoning hate for the thing, 
whatever it was. a hate so strong 



that he forgot to feel fear. It 
seemed to him to combine the 
repulsive qualities of a spider and 
a toad. The body, fat and re- 
pugnant, was covered by a loose 
skin, dull and leathery, and the 
fatness seemed to be pulled down- 
ward below the lower tentacles 
like an insect’s body, until it was 
wider at the bottom than at the 
top. 

Like a salt shaker, Stern 
thought. 

It turned its head — it had no 
neck: the loose skin of the body 
just turned with it — and looked 
back inside the sphere. The head 
resembled a toad's, but a long 
trident tongue slid in and out 
quickly, changing the resem- 
blance to that of a malformed 
snake. 

From the interior, Dr. Curtis 
appeared beside the creature and 
stood there vaguely for a moment. 
Stern noticed that his clothes 
seemed just as new as when he 
had left, but he had grown a 
long, untrimmed beard, and his 
face had a vacant expression, as 
if he were hypnotized. 

The creature looked upward at 
Curtis, who .was head and shoul- 
ders taller, and its resemblance 
changed again in Stern’s mind, 
so that now it looked like a dog, 
at least in attitude. From its 
mouth came a low hissing noise. 

Curtis looked down at the dog- 
spider -toad, his eyes slowly be- 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




MARTIANS NEVER DIE 



109 



ginning to focus. The creature 
wiggled like a seal with a ftsh in 
sight, then slid and bumped down 
the steps, with Curtis following 
him. 

“Clyde!" cried Beryl and 
rushed toward Curtis. 

The outstretched tentacles of 
the beast stopped her, but at a 
touch from Curtis they fell away 
and Beryl was in his arms. 

Stern watched the scene sourly 
and with rage in his heart. Why 
hadn’t Clyde waited another 
year? Then nothing could have 
changed things. Now he would 
lose not only Beryl, but the man- 
agement of the money that was 
left, and the marketing of new 
patents on the machine. Curtis 
did not approve of speculation, 
especially when it lost money. 

“You’ve changed, Clyde," Beryl 
was saying as she hugged him. 
“What is the matter — do you 
need a doctor?” 

“No. I don’t want a doctor, but 
I have to get home,” said Curtis. 

Stern felt anger again beating 
in his brain like heavy surf on a 
beach. Curtis was sick. The least 
he could have done was die. Well, 
maybe he still would. And if he 
didn’t he could be helped to — 
Stern saw the beast looking at 
him intently, malevolently. Its 
face might have looked almost 
human, now that it was so close, 
if it had possessed eyebrows and 
hair. As it was, its nose rose 



abruptly and flared into two 
really enormous nostrils, but its 
mouth looked small and wrinkled, 
like that of an old grandmother 
without any teeth. 

They turned to the doorway 
without noticing the absence of 
the reporters, who had long since 
run off to telephone and get 
photographers. 

Curtis walked slowly. He would 
stop for a moment, look about as 
if expecting something entirely 
different, and then he would move 
forward again. 

They all got into the car. Cur- 
tis and Beryl on the front seat, 
with Beryl driving, and Stern and 
the creature in the rear. As Beryl 
drove, Stern looked savagely at 
the back of Curtis's head, but he 
felt the beast staring at him bale- 
fully. Could it be a mind reader? 
That was ridiculous. How could 
anything that couldn’t speak read 
a person’s mind? 

He turned to study it. The 
Martian, if that was what it was, 
had only six tentacles, three on 
each side. The lower ones were 
heavy and almost as thick as legs. 
The upper ones were small and 
were obviously used as hands, 
while it was possible that the 
middle ones could be used cither 
way. A series of suction cups or 
sucking pads were at the end of 
each tentacle. With equipment like 
this, it could walk right up the 
side of a building, except, per- 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



haps, for the higher gravity of 
Earth. 

Stem could smell it now, a dry, 
desert smell, and that made it 
more revolting than ever. They 
were born to hate each other. 

W HEN they got home, Beryl 
was all solicitousness. The 
way a woman is when she has a 
man to impress, Stern thought. 

“Just sit right here in your old 
chair,” she told Curtis, “and I’ll 
call a doctor. Then I’ll put some 
water on to heat.” But first she 
knelt by his side and laid her 
head on his breast. “Oh, darling,” 
she said with a sob, “Why did 
you wait so long? I’ve missed you 
so.” 

A very good act. Stern told 
himself bitterly, without believing 
it at all. 

She got up and turned toward 
Stem. “Will you help me get 
some water on, Al?” she asked. 
“I’m going to phone.” 

He went into the kitchen. He 
knew where the kettle was, the 
refrigerator, the mixings. He 
could hear her dialing, and then, 
before he got the kettle on the 
burner, she came inside and 
closed the kitchen door. 

“Clyde’s sick and I have to 
take care of him,” she said 
anxiously. 

It wasn’t entirely the money, 
he confessed to himself now. He 
hated the situation, but he had 



to give in — on the surface any* 
way. 

“Okay, let's forget the whole 
thing,” he said. 

“Oh, Al dear, I knew you’d un- 
derstand! I’ve got to go back now 
and try the phone again. I got a 
busy signal.” 

Stern followed her, still ran- 
kling at the way Curtis had 
forced Beryl to live while he spent 
so generously on his own expen- 
sive interests. Shortly after their 
marriage, he had built a home 
for Beryl and himself in an ex- 
clusive suburb, on a hilly bit 
of land with a deep ravine at the 
back. But it was small and Beryl 
had not even been allowed maids 
except when they entertained, 
which was seldom. Soon he would 
change all that, Stem told him- 
self. They had not dared to while 
Clyde was away. 

In the modem living room, 
Curtis sprawled in his easy chair 
as though he hadn’t moved since 
they had placed him there. But 
his air of abstraction seemed to 
have increased. Before him sat 
the beast, looking, Stern thought, 
more like a dog than ever. Its 
head wasn’t cocked to one side, 
but that, less than its alien ap- 
pearance, was the one thing to 
spoil the illusion. 

Tires screeched in the driveway 
while Beryl was still at the tele-^ 
phone. Stern went to the front 
door, closed it and put the chain 



MARTIANS NEVER DIE 



bolt in place. The back door 
would still be locked and they 
would hardly try to force the 
screen windows. 

Heavy steps pounded up the 
front walk- “Did Dr. Curtis really 
get back?” The first man shot out. 
The one who followed had a 
camera. 

“Dr. Curtis has returned,’* 
Stern spoke through the opening 
of the front door which the chain 
permitted, “but his physical con- 
dition won’t permit questioning, 
at least until his doctor has seen 
him.” 

“Did he really bring back a 
Martian? We want to sec the 
Martian anyway.” 

“We can’t have Dr. Curtis dis- 
^prbed in any way until after his 
physician has examined him,” 
Stern said bluntly. 

“Is he in there?” 

“We’ll give you a report when 
we’re ready.” 

A SECOND car pulled up to 
the house as Stem shut the 
front door and went to check tlie 
rear one. When he came back, 
flashes from the window showed 
the cameraman was trying to take 
pictures through the glass. Stern 
drew the shades. 

“Well, poor Schaughtowl, so 
you had to come with me,” Cur- 
tis was saying to the monster. 

The beast wiggled again as it 
had on the steps of the machine. 



A tail to wag wasn’t really neces- 
sary, Stern decided, when there 
was so much body to wiggle. 

Schaughtowl, as Curtis ad- 
dressed it, seemed to brighten in 
the darkened room. 

“Poor, dear Schaughtowl,” said 
Curtis gently. 

It was unmistakable now — ^the 
skin actually brightened and 
emitted a sort of eerie, luminous 
glow. 

Curtis leaned over and put his 
hand on what would have been 
Schaughtowl’s neck. The loose 
skin writhed joyously, and, snake- 
like, the whole body responded in 
rippling waves of emotion. 

“Gull Lup,” the monster — said 
wasn’t the right word, but it was 
not a bark, growl, mew, cheep, 
squawk or snarl. Gulp was as 
close as Stem could come, a dry 
and almost painful gulping noise 
that expressed devotion in some 
totally foreign way that Stern 
found revolting. 

He realized that the phone had 
been ringing for some time. He 
disconnected it, and then heard 
loud knocking. 

“It’s Dr. Anderson,” he heard a 
man’s voice calling impatiently 
and angrily. 

Cautiously, Stern opened the 
door, but his care was needless. 
With a few testy remarks, the 
doctor quickly cleared a space 
about the door and entered. 

He went at once to Curtis, with

only a single shocked glance at 
Shaughtowl. 

“Wlicre the devil have you been 
and where in hell did you get that 
thing?” he asked as he unbut- 
toned Curtis's coat and shirt. 

Since playing with his pet, Cur- 
tis seemed more awake. “I went 
to Mars,” he said. ‘‘They’re in- 
credibly advanced in ways we 
hardly guess. We’re entirely off 
the track. I just came back to 
explain how.” 

“Your friend doesn’t look very 
intelligent,” the doctor answered, 
busy with his stethoscope. 

‘‘Animals like Schaughtowl arc 
used for steeds or pets.” said Cur- 
tis. “The Ladonai are pretty much 
like mankind, only smaller.” 
“Why did you stay so long?” 
“After I left, the Ladonai told 
me. they were going to shut off 
any possible communication with 
^arth until we advance more. 
They think we’re at a very dan- 
gerous animal-like stage of de- 
velopment. Once I came home, 
I knew I couldn’t go back, so I 
wanted to learn as much as I 
could before I left them.” 

“Stand up for a minute.” or- 
dered the doctor. 

“Not right now.” said Curtis. 
“I’m too tired.” 

“You’d better get to bed, then.” 
“I think not. It’s merely caused 
by the difference in gravity and 
heavier air. The Ladanoi told me 
to expect it. but not to lie down. 

MARTIANS NCVCR DIE 



After a while I’ll try to take a 
short walk.” 

S O Clyde wasn’t going to die, 
after all. Stern tliought. He 
had come home with a message, 
and, remembering the determina- 
tion of the man, Stern knew he 
wouldn’t die until he had given it. 
But he had to die. He would die, 
and who was competent enough 
to know that it wasn’t from the 
shock of having come home to 
denser air and a heavier gravity? 

There were ways — an oxygen 
tube, for example. Pure oxygen 
to be inhaled in his sleep by lungs 
accustomed to a rarified atmos- 
phere, or stimulants in his food 
so it would look like a little too 
much exertion on a heart already 
overtaxed. There were ways. 
Stern’s scalp tingled unpleas- 
antly, and he saw the Martian 
looking at him intently, coldly. 
In that moment Stern knew with- 
out question that his mind was 
being read. Not his idea, per- 
haps, but his intent toward Cur- 
tis. The Martian would have to 
be attended to first. 

“Is It true, Dr. Anderson? Will 
he be all right?” Beryl was sitting 
on the arm of the chair next to 
Schaughtowl, and she was look- 
ing at Clyde almost as adoringly 
as the Martian. A few hours had 
undone all that Stern had man- 
aged to do in four years. 

If Stern had been uncertain, 

IIS 



that alone would have decided 
him. 

“I think, so,” said the doctor. 
“He seems to be uncomfortable, 
rather than in pain. I’ll send you 
a prescription for his heart, if he 
breathes too heavily. Be sure, 
though, not to give him more 
than one pill in three hours.” 

“Of course.” Beryl was never 
that solicitous toward Stern. 

“And you’ll be in quarantine 
here until the government decides 
what, if any, diseases he and the 
Martian may have brought back 
with them.” 

“None at all, Poctor.” Curtis’s 
voice was markedly mose slurred, 
«nd he stared intently with un- 
blinking eyes at the blank wall. 
% “Well, that’s something we 
can’t tell yet. We’ll have to keep 
©ut the press and television men, 
anyway, because of your health. 
Jf I’m not detained. I’ll be back 
tomorrow morning. Call me if 
there’s any change.” 

On his way out, the physician 
was besieged by reporters and 
photographers, baulked of better 
subjects. Shortly after the doc- 
tor’s departure, police sirens came 
screaming up. The men waiting 
around the house were moved 
outside the gate and a guard was 
set at every entrance. 

L ater, a messenger came, was 
interrogated by the police 
sergeant who took a small pack- 



age from him and brought it to 
the house. 

“Medicine,” the sergeant said, 
handing it gingerly to Stern. “You 
can’t leave here without permis- 
sion.” And he walked hurriedly 
away. 

This might be the answer. Stem 
had a good idea of what the doc- 
tor had prescribed — something 
he’d said, for the heart. It must 
have been pretty powerful, too, 
for the doctor to warn against an 
overdose. Two at once might do 
it or another two a little later. 

But there was Schaughtowl. 

“Al,” said Beryl, “stay with 
Clyde while 1 fix something for 
him to eat.” 

She was more beautiful than 
ever. Emotions, he thought wryly, 
become a woman; they thrive on 
them. In a few minutes a woman 
could change like this. It was 
enough to make a man lose fai^ 
in the sex. 

“Certainly,” he said easily. 

Curtis seemed to sleep with 
wide open eyes gazing blankly 
at the far wall. Schaughtowl sat 
motionless before him, watchful 
as a dog. yet still like a snake or 
spider- patiently waiting. Didn’t 
the beast ever sleep? 

A drink was what Stern needed. 
He went to the closet and poured 
a double brandy. He sipped it 
slowly. As delicious fire ran down 
his gullet and warmed his stom- 
ach, he felt his tension ease and 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a sense of confidence pervade his 
mind. 

He needn’t worry. He was al- 
ways successful, except that once 
with the stocks. And be had calm 
nerves. 

There were guards out in front 
now in khaki uniform ; the Gov- 
ernor must have called out a 
company of the National Guard. 
Stern noticed some state police, 
too. The house was well guarded 
on the three sides surrounded by 
a neat, white picket fence. In the 
back, the severe drop into the ra- 
vine made guards there unneces- 
sary. 

It was dark before Dr. Curtis 
moved. Beryl was watching him; 
she had little to say to Stern 
now. 

“How about some broth, dear?” 
she asked Curtis immediately. 

Slowly, Clyde’s eyes focused on 
her. He smiled. “Let’s try it.’* 

He let Beryl feed him, sitting 
on a stool beside his chair and 
being unnecessarily motherly and 
coddling about it. 

For a while after he had eaten, 
Clyde sat in his chair, looking at 
Beryl with his new and oddly 
gentle smile. It seemed to acti- 
vate some hidden response in her, 
for she glowed with tenderness. 

“I suppose,” Curtis slurred, “I 
ought to try to walk now.” 

“Let me help.” Stern rose and 
crossed the room. 

The Martian rustled like snakes 

MARTIANS NEVER DIE ^ 



in the weeds, and hissed. 

Beryl said without suspicion, 
“Thank you, Al. 1 knew you’d do 
whatever you could for Clyde.” 
And she rested her hand trust- 
ingly on his arm. 

What was past was past, not to 
be wept over, not to be regretted. 

“Like to walk out in the back 
for the air?” Stern asked. “The 
breeze Is coming from that di- 
rection.” 

“That will do very well,” said 
Curtis, obviously not caring a bit. 

S TERN helped Curtis from his 
chair and supported him un- 
der the arm. They went out the 
back door, the Martian slithering 
after them. It was cooler in the 
garden. Stern felt a renewed surge 
of self-confidence. 

“The stars — ” Curtis stopped 
to look upward. 

The night was almost cloudless 
and there was no Moon. The 
house hid any view of the crowds 
and the guards holding them 
back. They were alone in the 
dark. 

Curtis started forward again, 
with the Martian scraping along 
behind. It would never let Curtis 
out of its sight as long as it lived; 
that much was clear to Stern. 

He guided Curtis to a seat close 
to the ravine, a favorite spot. Al- 
ways the Martian was a step— -or 
a slither — behind, and when Cur- 
tis sat down, Schaughtowl sat be* 



‘ 115 



tween his beloved master and the 
precipitous drop. 

Stern picked up a rock from 
the rock garden and tossed it 
into the ravine. The Martian did 
not take his eyes off Curtis. Stem 
picked up a larger rock, a sharp, 
pointed one. He was behind the 
Martian and Curtis was looking 
away unseeingly into the night. 

It was simple, really, and well 
executed. The beast’s skull bashed 
in easily, being merely thin bones 
for a thin atmosphere and light 
gravitation. A push sent it over 
the edge of the ravine. 

Curtis sat unnoticing, and the 
traffic jam out front created more 
than enough confusion to drown 
out any noise from the creature’s 
fall. ♦ 

Stern’s palm stung. He realized 
that, before the Martian had 
pitched over the ravine, a suction 
pad had for a moment caught at 
his hand. It had done the beast 
no good, though. 

Curiously, the Martian had not 
guarded itself, only Curtis. Sit- 
ting with its back to Stern had 
really invited attack. The mind- 
reading ability was just some- 
thing that Stem had nervously 
imagined. 

The police would not be able 
to tell his rock from any other. 
The heavy body, its ungainly 
movement and thin bones would 
explain ever5Tthing. Besides, there 
was no motive for killing the 



Martian and what penalty could 
there be? It couldn’t be called 
murder. 

Stern looked at the palm of his 
right hand, the one that had held 
the rock. It stung a little, but in 
the darkness he couldn’t see it. 
A stinger of some kind, like a 
bee, probably. The hell with it — 
couldn’t be fatal or Curtis would 
have warned them about it. 

The Martian had been walking 
by the ravine and had clumsily 
fallen in. He would report it after 
he had got Curtis back into the 
house. 

Curtis was easy to arouse and 
didn’t seem to miss Schaughtowl. 
Stern maneuvered him to the liv- 
ing room, where he sank into a 
chair and fell into his mood of 
abstraction. 

Beryl must be in the kitchen 
cleaning up, Stern supposed. Per- 
haps he had better put some kind 
of germicide on his palm, just to 
ward off infection. 

TT E looked at Curtis relaxed in 
-■■■■- the chair. Clyde suddenly ap- 
peared oddly boyish to him, 
hardly different than he had 
been in college days. For a mo- 
ment, Stern felt again the ado- 
lescent admiration and fellowship 
he had felt so strongly then. Don’t 
be stupid, he told himself angrily. 
This man had the money ai^d 
the woman that had almost be- 
longed to him. 

GALAXY SCIENCE F 1 C Y I O N

lYl'OVING slowly, Stem delt- 
ciously savored the aroma of 
his triumph. On the table was the 
bottle. Clyde would be easy, un- 
suspecting. kindly. 

It wouldn’t be safe to marry 
Beryl right away, but there could 
never be any suspicion. 

No need to hurry. For a mo- 
ment he wanted to watch Curtis. 
He wondered what kind of pic- 
tures Clyde was seeing on the 
blank wall. Martian landscapes? 
The strange Ladonais? Too bad 
he hadn’t stayed on Mars. Stern 
couldn’t help having a friendly 
feeling for his old college chum, 
pity, too, for what must happen 
to him soon. 

This was no way to kill anyone! 

He was growing old and soft! 

Nevertheless, Curtis did have a 
noble and striking face. Funny 
he had never noticed it before. 
It seemed to glow with an un- 
canny peace. 

Unnoticed, the numbness crept 
from Stern’s palm along his right 
arm, and a prickly sensation ap- 
peared in his right leg. 

It was funny to read a person's 
thoughts like this. Love flowed 
from Curtis like the warm glow 
from a burning candle. A sort 
of halo had formed from the light 
above hts head. 

Symbolic. 

From Curtis came wave after 
wave of love. He could feel it 



pulsating toward him, and he felt 
his own heart turn over,, answer 
it. Yes. Curtis was noble. 

Stern sank cross-legged on the 
floor beside Curtis and gazed at 
him. The prickly sensation had 
ascended from his leg up through 
his chest and to his neck. But it 
didn’t matter. Now, for a last 
time, he could feel the spell of 
that perfect friendship — before 
the end. 

What end? Why should there 
be any end to this eternal mo- 
ment? 

Curtis noticed him now. Those 
half-closed eyes were strangely 
penetrating. They looked him 
through. 

“Well, Al,“ he said, “so you 
killed Schaughtowl ?’’ 

Stern looked at the kindly, god- 
like face and loved it. 

Killed whom? 

“Poor Al,“ Curtis said. He 
leaned over and laid his hand on 
the back of Stern’s neck, fondling 
it much as one would a dog. 
“Poor old Al.” 

Stern’s heart leaped in joy. 
This was ecstasy. It must be ex- 
pressed. It demanded expression. 
If he had possessed a tail, he 
would have wagged it. Perhaps 
there was a word for that bliss. 
There was, and with immense 
satisfaction he spoke it. 

“Gull Lup,” he said.

TOI^ORROW AND TOMOR- 
ROW and THE FAIRY CHESS- 
MEN, by Lewis Padgett. Gnome 
Press, New York, 1951. 254 pages, 
$2.75 

I T is shocking to reread these 
two short novels four and five 
years after they originally ap- 
peared in magazine form. They 
are as superb as ever — but today 
they seem grim, bitter, almost 
psychopathological. (Which is 
not meant to scare the reader 
away from them; they arc also 
sheer enchantVnent to read. That 
is their paradox.) 

“Tomorrow and Tomorrow” 
states that it is better for hu- 



manity to have a war— even an 
atomic war — than to have sci- 
entific and cultural stasis under a 
“benevolent” dictatorship. The 
tale tells how a few remaining 
free minds work to persuade a 
guardian of one of the world’s 
atomic piles to set it off and thus 
bring about the chaos which will 
make it possible to begin scien- 
tific research again and get man- 
kind out of its deadly rut. 

“The Fairy Chessmen” is con- 
cerned with the even grimmer no- 
tion that wars are inevitable. 
Throughout an endless future, • 
which is an integral part of this 
story through the development 
of ETP (Extra-Temporal Per- 



ils

ception) in a few unfortunate 
people, war seems to be the be-all 
and end-all of man’s life, without 
purpose, without victory, with- 
out end. Actually, of course, 
“The Fairy Chessmen,” with all 
its rich, concepts, is still primarily 
an almost frantic plea against 
what its author conceives to be 
the inevitable road to destruction 
down which modern man is trav- 
eling. 

Both stories are unreservedly 
recommended despite their mor- 
bid and, to me, indefensible 
philosophy. 

THE CITY IN THE SEA, by 
Wilson Tucker. Rinehart 8g Co., 
New York, 1951. 250 pagesj $2.50 

R are indeed in science fiction 
can one complain that some- 
thing is underwritten. The con- 
verse usually is true — a torrent 
of purple words and no sub- 
stance. 

Here, on the contrary, is an 
example of a pretty big-time con- 
cept being more or less deflated 
by a somewhat inadequate han- 
dling. 

Even so, the story is a fasci- 
nating one. From its cold and 
rainy opening in the mist of the 
female warriors’ camp in the 
Crown Colony of Western Som- 
erset, to its shimmering, sunlit, 
mirage-protected ending abewe 
the mysterious (and never-seen) 



City in the Sea, far in the un- 
known western hinterland, it 
spins a spell. 

It is a story of the far future; 
of a ' society of women ; of the 
advent of a man and how he led 
a band of these women to his 
mysterious City; and why these 
women were wanted in that City. 
Yet the whole story seems limp, 
despite the excellence of its con- 
cept. One could wish that its 
author could have slipped into 
a sort of unconscious collabora- 
tion with someone like Robert 
Graves, who could have taken 
this theme and these people and 
blown the whole thing up into a 
rich brew of wonderful stuff.

“Interloper,” by Poul Ander- 
son — fairly effective alien inva- 
sion. 

“Death Sentence,” by Isaac 
Asimov. Interesting tale, though 
weak in its ending. 

“This Is the Land,” by Nelson 
Bond. Surprisingly grim tale of 
world’s end. Not bad. 

“Ylla.” by Ray Bradbury. I 
personally love this tale, but then 
I'm a notorious Bradburian. 

“The Green Cat.” by Cleve 
Cartmill. Run-of-the-mill alien 
invasion concept. 

“Git Along!” by L. Sprague de 
Camp. I wish I could find this 
funny, but I can’t. 

“Service First,” by David H. 
Keller. Fine old haywire classic, 
ver;^much worth reviving. 

“Shock,” by Henry Kuttner 
(originally published under the 
Fadgett byline). A very superior 
time travel story. 

“The Ship Sails at Midnight,” 
by Fritz Leiber. Excellent alien 
invasion in the “Angel’s Egg” 
tradition. 

“The Power,” by Murray Lein- 
ster. Absolutely superb; the alien 
invader seen through the eyes of 
the medieval necromancer. The 
old master at top form. 

“The Critters,” by Frank B. 
Long. Good plot, good idea, but 
painful writing and ending. 

“Pardon My Mistake,” by 
Fletcher Pratt. O. Henry takes up 
space travel. 



“Good Night, Mr. James,” by 
Clifford Simak. From this maga- 
zine and certainly worth re- 
printing. 

“The Plutonian Drug.” by 
Clark Ashton Smith. Unreadable. 

“Farewell to Eden,” by Theo-

wee bit incomprehensible to me. 

“Co-operate — or Else!” by 
A. E. van Vogt. Ezwals, Rulls, 
Rytt killer plants and Prof. 
Jamieson. Big Fat Stuff on a far

“Finality Unlimited,” by Don-

can’t read. 

A pretty fair average, I would 
say, as current anthologies go.

riiHIS famous “classic,” now 
over eleven years old, has been 
reprinted by popular demand, 
and a good thing, too. A little 
overblown, considerably melo-

really gripping adventure stories 
about supermen. It lacks the 
depth, the perceptiveness, the 
irony and the satire to be found 
in the more profound Odd John, 
by Olaf Stapledon (recently re-

it tells an equally exciting story.

She 

Who 

Laughs 

By PETER PHILLIPS 




Illustrated by JONES 



It's really a very simple story— if you refuse to 



believe in ghosts and know that time is circular! 



I ’D been waiting two hundred 
years for this guy. 

He stood there in the grav- 
eled driveway with the estate 
agent, looking over the frontage 
of the mansion. 

The sun was hot. The a^^nt 
took oiT his hat, mopped his 



balding head. I wondered whether 
I could spit that far from the up- 
stairs window where I was watch- 
ing them. I decided I probably 
could, but I wouldn’t. 

, The agent said, in a thick 
brogue ,I can’t reproduce in its 
glottal richness: “If it’s se-dusion

you’re wantin’, Mr. Mullen, you’d 
not better this foine upstandin’ 
place this soide -of Ballygorc. 
There’s room to stretch your legs 
and fill your lungs with air that 
shweeps down from the moun- 
tains over covert and shweet pas- 
ture for your own special delec- 
tation and delight.” 

My lips were moving with his. 
I’d heard it before. I knew the 
sucker would take the place. And 
I knew the agent, back in 
Thaughbcen, having dropped 
most of his beautiful stage 
brogue, would soon be saying: 
“He’s paying in dollars, too, boys. 
And then, in the season, I’ll sell 
them to the English tourists. This 
is an occasion to celebrate. Porter 
all round: on me.” 

MuUen, casual as all hell, 
standing there with the agent, 
pretended to be considering. 

1 whisked down the baluster- 
rail. stood just behind the door 
as they came in. 

“Nice hall,’^ Mullen said un- 
enthusiastically. He was wearing 
a drape suit. He didn’t need 
drapes to bulk him out. Those 
shoulders had spearheaded the 
forward line three seasons at col- 
*Jege, if my information was cor- 
rect. 

Indignant, the agent said: 
*TJice? It’s talking like an Eng- 
lishman you are, instead of a 
citizen o’ the greatest country in 
the world.” (“Bar Ireland,” he 



added under his breath.) “Lookit 
the size of ut-— the staircase, the 
paneling, the great wide windows, 
and that landin’ there where the 
mighty O’Rourke stood and with 
the Sword of Kings defied the 
brayin’ cowards o’ Cromwell till 
he was struck a traitor blow 
from behind, and, like a great- 
girthed tree smitten in its prime, 
fell among the cur-dogs and car- 
ried a full half-dozen of them 
to death with him. Here at this 
very spot!” 

The agent flung out a dra- 
matic hand. I’d crept up behind 
them during the spiel. I never tire 
of hearing it. 

Mullen stepped back. I dodged. 

“Fool place to make a stand 
anyway,” he muttered, looking at 
the balcony between the two 
staircases. 

“Arragh! The O’Rourke could 
foight as well with the two hands 
as the one. A sword in each, there 
he stood, facin’ them both 
ways — ” ^ 

“Sure, sure. Now how many 
bedrooms did you say?” 

I followed them around. Mul- 
len wasn’t interested in bedrooms, 
only in the cellar. But I was 
waiting for the final spiel, dic- 
tated by what the agent retained 
of a conscience. 

“There’s jist one small matter,” 
he said, standing in the hall again 
after they’d looked the place 
over. “You may have been bearin’

lies about this place in Thaugh- 
been, maybe from those loafers 
around Golighan’s bar, and 
though I wouldn’t be askin’ yez 
to disregard ut entoirely — ” 

“The haunt, you mean?” said 
Mullen. 1 grinned to myself. “I 
heard about it during the war 
when I was stationed just across 
the border. That's when I became 
interested in the place. I looked 
it over, saw the power plant. 
There’s quite a head of water in 
that stream. The memory of that 
stayed in the back of my mind 
until the other day, when I was 
in London with my wife, seeing 
some friends. Then I remembered 
this place. I have some work to 
do. I want electrical power and 
privacy. So I hopped the jet liner 
to Dublin and came up here — ” 
“And you’ll take it, sorr? 
Ghost an’ all?” 

If Mullen paid extra for a 
ghost, I thought, he'd be thor- 
oughly had. But he said firmly: 
“I’m not buying your ghost. In 
another minute you’ll be saying 
it’s an asset to the place. It’s a 
hundred years since my folk left 
this country, but we haven’t gone 
soft. What’s your price for this 
tumbledown she-been?” 

“The final price," said the 
agent, taking a deep, careful 
breath, “for a year’s tenancy, in 
advance, in dollars, is — how much 
did you offer?" 



“I didn't. But you can tell 
your client I’ll pay a thousand.” 

“Don’t be shamin’ me,’’ said 
the agent, as I blew a cool breath 
down his neck. “It’s meself that 
owns the place as you well know, 
if you know as much as you do.” 

He drew up his coat collar. 
“Now let’s be discussin’ the de- 
tails elsewhere.” 

T FOLLOWED them down the 
drive, into the shay. I could 
get away from the place now for 
a while. 

It was late afternoon. The 
green border hills in the distance 
were drawing up mist from the 
shadowed bog as their green 
darkened in the slanting sun: and 
the new-cut hay in the nearer 
fields brought relished delight. 

Two hundred years I’d waited 
for this jaunt. I enjoyed every 
second of it, even the acrid stink 
from Pethal’s ill-cared-for hogs 
as we passed the holding. The 
hoppity-clop of the pony’s hoofs 
on the dust-blown road was 
music. 

Over the green-lichened bridge 
by the trout stream trotted the 
pony. I promised myself to do 
some fishing there soon. I’d use 
a quiet worm and snooze in t’ne 
sun. Fly-fishing was too strenu- 
ous in this moist heat. 

■And I’d look over my 'shoulder 
now and e^ain at the long pile 
of Thau^hbeen House and lau^K

The 1au£h would be on me. That 
always makes it iunnier, in Ire- 
land. 

Down from the bridge, ancf the 
road broadened into the village 
of Thaughbeen. 

The agent introduced Mullen 
to Golighan. "Stationed in the 
Six Counties durin’ the war,” he 
said, "and mindful of the beau- 
ties of the country, and wishin’ 
to do a little book-work or such, 
decided to take over the place for 
a year or maybe more. And you’ll 
be wastin’ your time, Michael, me 
boy, tellin’ him about the haunt 
to take the bread out of me very 
mouth, for Mister Mullen knows 
all about it.” 

"Sit down and rest the onaisy 
tongue of yez,” said Golighan, 
trying to outdo the agent’s 
brogue. "Y’don’t think he’d be 
taken in onyway by yer gabblin’, 
wid a name loike Mullen. What’ll 
you drink?” 

Mullen ordered Jamieson’s 
Irish whisky. The agent took 
thick Dublin stout. 

I watched Mullen roll the 
smokey-peat flavor around his 
tongue. Two hundred years since 
I’d had the sweet, rare tang of 
it tickling my gullet . - . 

I licked invisible lips in antici- 
pation. 

They stayed through the eve- 
ning, with the real talk beginning 
when the lads drifted in. 

There was Sean Healey, Tom 



O’Reilly — both, if I remembered 
right, working a pittance on Lord 
Freightowel’s estate. Seamas 
Mulvaney, smallholder — how 
many times had I seen him, as a 
barefoot gossoon, nicking plums 
from the kitchen j;arden at 
Thaughbeen House, looking often 
at the silent, window-eyed place 
with his own green, feary eyes, 
and me at an upstairs window 
holding in my breath not to give 
one of the ghostly groans I’d 
practiced so long and send him in 
a tear -breeches scramble down 
the tree. 

Then there was gutsy Bran 
Bailey who’d actually come in- 
side one night, stood in the hall 
and with all his big little heart 
bawled: "The hell an’ back wid 
banshees! T don’t believe in ’em!” 

I’d been so pleased with his 
common sense that I forgot my- 
self and called out the truth: 
"Good for you, kid. I’m no 
banshee. I’m no kind of goddam 
ghost. There’s no such things.” 

But poor Bran was running so 
fast, I doubted he’d heard me. 

Anyway, here he was in Goli- 
ghan’s, grown big and broad, and 
putting in his two cents’ worth 
about the goings-on at Thaugh- 
been House. 

"It was during the war,” Bran 
said, "and, being so near the bor- 
der, we had a jeepful of your 
fellers running in here every night 
to stoke up on Mister Golighan’s 



124 r

brew. And one night we tell them 
about the House, and about how 
poor daft Johnnie Maur goes up 
there now and again to play chess 
with the ghost, as he said. Poor 
Johnnie, gone eleven months 
now — ” 

Johnnie was dead? I'd missed 
him. 

Every time I heard that John- 
nie was dead, it^shocked me. 

He’d stumble into the House, 
liquored up to the fringe of his 
red hair, white face vacant and 
mild, shouting in the empty echo- 
ing halt: 

"It’s a game of chess I’m of- 
ferin’ yez, for, banshees or not, 
ye’re the only dacent player this 
soide of Dublin who can tax me 
wandhering wits!” 

I hope Johnnie’s found another 
"dacent player,” wherever he’s 
gone. 

Bran Bailey was talking on in 
Golighan’s bar, with Mullen lean- 
ing forward and taking it all in. 

“So one night,” says Bran, “the 
whole near-dozen of ’em starts 
off up there, with this great roarin’ 
sergeant straddlin’ the front and 
shoutin’ : ‘Look out, ghost, here 
we come, eight little Yankee boys 
full of rum I’ 

“And the jeep goin’ so slow 
with them aboard,” says Bran, 
“and the rain makin’ a bog of 
the road, we follow after these 
fellers to see what the Thaugh- 
becn House ghost does with ’em. 



••And they get halfway up the 
drive to the house, and the jeep 
stops, and there’s the driver 
thumpin’ and pullin’ everything 
and callin’ on all the saints, until 
the sergeant unstraddles himself 
and pulls up the front coverin’. 

"Then he jist stands there, rain 
sweatin’ off his^ great red face 
and him suddenly as sober as a 
bangin’ judge on a Monday, and 
he says: ‘Put it back! Put it back 
quick before 1 believe my eyes, 
and I swear I’ll never touch an- 
other drop again!’ And we come 
up and look over his shoulder. 

"And there’s nothing there un- 
der the hood. Nothing at all, at 
all.” 

/ hadn't meant to swipe the 
the whole motor at first. The tele- 
port exhausted me for days. But 
I got annoyed when I'd yanked 
off three plug-leads and that 
damned jeep kept banging away 
on one cylinder. 

"And never a sight of the motor 
since,” concluded Bran Bailey. 

Said Mullen: "Yes. I heard of ^ 
it. I was captain of their unit. 
We had to have the jeep towed 
away.” 

"So you’re not troublin’ your- 
self about the creature at all?” 
asked Sean Healey. 

"Why should I? It’s never 
harmed anybody, far as I can 
see.” 

Thanks for them kind words, 
pal.

ing.” was all I said. 

“So does this whole situation. 
Hey, if these forecasts of yours 
turn out right, how about giving 
me the winners at Ballymuchray 
this afternoon?’* 

Mullen was recovering pretty 
quickly, it seemed. 

I said: “I don’t play the horses. 
If you’ve finished down here, you 
might as well get up to the 
kitchen and make yourself some 
coffee. No need to check that 
wiring any more. I’ve already 
done it. You’ve got a lazy morn- 
ing ahead.” 

“The morning,” he said, “hasn’t 
yet started. I’m not awake yet.” 
“So now I’m part of a dream, 
am I? Get upstairs before I bat 
you with a clod of hard air.” 

He muttered his way up to the 
kitchen, plunked an open pot on 
the stove, which he’d already 
lighted. Blue smoke puffed inter- 
mittently between the bars, filling 
the place with pungent haze. 

Mullen looked up at the ceil- 
ing. addressed it politely: “I sup- 
pose, Mr. Fixit, you can tell me 
what’s wrong with this thing?” 
“Naturally. Get hold of the 
poker and belt that flue pipe 
about halfway up. The plate’s 
jammed and doesn’t operate from 
the outside. Shank broke off way 
back.” 

He belted. The fire roared up 
suddenly. 

“Thanks,” he said. “Could I 



interest you in a cup of coffee?” 
“Very funny,” I grunted sourly. 

W HILE he sipped his brew, I 
slipped out to tell my “wife” 
how things were shaping up. My 
wife was bom to lay the eggs and 
crow as well. I’d suffered two 
hundred years of hell from her 
tongue. Blamed me for every- 
thing. She even beefed about my 
innocent games of chess with 
Johnnie Maur. 

And I remember when the 
Marchmont family was in occu- 
pation of Thaughbeen House, 
she’d scare half the life out of 
little Lilian Marchmont just be- 
cause I happened to remark casu- 
ally on her good looks. That gives 
you a picture of my wife — a pos- 
sessive shrew, to keep it in human 
terms which really don’t apply 
very well. 

She started in on me now, so 
I grabbed up the chess board and 
pieces from the attic and skipped 
down from the Tenth Plane, 
where she was lying up and wait- 
ing for me to do most of the 
work, 

When I got back to the kitchen, 
Mullen was tapping at the walls 
and ceiling with a broomstick. 

“No secret panels or hidden 
amplifiers,” I said. “It’s all genu- 
ine physical phenomena.” 

He looked round and breathed 
heavily. “Now I’ve seen every- 
thing.”

Mullen decided to stay at GoU- 
ghan’s until a few essentials had 
been carried up to the House. 
Meantime, he wired his wife to 
join him. 



F our days later, he took up 
residence. He came early. But 
early. The energy of that man! I 
was still resting when I heard 
him poking around in the cellars, 
tracing through the wiring from 
the turbo-house. 

I slipped down from where I 
go when I take a rest — don't ask 
me where that is; it's a state, not 
a place — and gummed down after 
him. He was lifting a tarpaulin 
in a corner of one of the smaller 
cellars: it used to be a cold-larder. 

He looked at the jeep motor 
and^ made funny disbelieving 
noises. 



.“So,” I said, “it wasn’t the 
potheen. I figure you owe the 
sergeant and the other Company 
D hoys one big-handed apology- 
plus the dough you docked ’em 
to pay for it.” 

. He came around so fast, he 
tripped and planted the tight part 
of his pants on one of the hobbly 
bits of the jeep motor. 

„ “What — where are you?” 

“Not in heaven or in hell, but 
just as elusive as the Pimpernel. 
As to what I am, you’re going to 
tell me, I hope. That’s what I’ve 
been waiting for — a long, long 
time. Meanwhile, Mr. Mullen,” 



I said, “you’re soiling those nicely 
creased pants of yours.” 

He upped off the engine, dusted 
his pants automatically. Some- 
thing the Army did for him— 
gave him a pride in his clothes. 

“Do you mind,” he said, his 
brain beginning to work, “show- 
ing yourself? I hate like hell ac- 
cepting sartorial advice from a 
voice without a body.” 

“That takes energy,” I said, 
“like compressing these air mole- 
cules to make sound waves. But 
it takes a lot of energy and a 
lot of material and right now I 
don’t feel like dressing up to give 
you something to look at or talk 
at. However, I don't mind giving 
you a slight idea. Scrape some 
dust off those shelves, toss it up 
under that bulb, and stand back.” 
“I am nuts,” he enunciated 
carefully. 

“Sure. But do it. And nund 
your coat cuffs.” 

As the cloud of tiny particles 
drifted down, I slipped in and 
charged them so they hung 
around the vortices of my anti- 
particles. 

“Almighty catfish!” Mullen 
gulped. “A naked ghost!” 

“I’m no ghost, and I don’t have 
to be this shape, either,” I said, 
adjusting the network. “Is this 
any better? Dogs are always 
naked,” 

He backed off, slapping at the 
air. “For God’s sake, be human

if you can't be natural! I mean—** 
“Listen,” I said, peeved, “that 
was a prirc mastiff I once saw. I 
can always do a mountain lion 
or a grizzly. Get me a roll of 
cheesecloth, or even a bedsheet 
at a pinch, and I’ll really show 
you something.” 

“I’ve seen enough,” he said, 
digging knuckles in his eyes and 
shaking his head as if something 
was loose inside. “Go away.” 
“Maybe you’re right. I’ve got 
more important things to do with 
my energy than fool around to 
amuse you.” 

"Amuse me?” He made a noise 
like an emptying bathtub. “I’d 
laugh easier in a morgue. Get 
back where you came from and 
make the worms laugh.” 

“I’m not,” I repeated patiently, 
ghost, a ghoulie, a banshee, 
or anything of the whatsoever 
kind. I’ve never met up with one 
and I don’t expect to. Like young 
Bran Bailey, I don’t believe in 
*cm. Neither do you, fortunately. 
But explanations can wait. Has 
any of the stufr turned up yet?” 
That got him. “What stuff?” 
“Couple of tubes from Marsh- 
all’s of London, specification al- 
loy plates from Birmingham, that 
dingus you borrowed from the 
Sorbonne.” 

“Your intelligence service must 
be good.” 

"You’d be surprised.” 

“Then you tell me where it is.” 



*T was just making conversa* 
tion,” I said. “It’s on the way to 
Thaughbeen station now. Johnny 
McGuire will be carting it over 
around lunchtime. And your wife, 
who is wondering what in hell 
you’re up to anyway, has reluc- 
tantly left her bright friends in 
London and is on her way to ask 
why you took over this moth- 
eaten old shack without consult- 
ing her first, especially since it’s 
her money you’re fooling around 
with.” 

Mullen’s lower jaw was nearly 
resting on his collar by this time. 

“Incidentally.” I asked, “how 
is the darling girl? Has she en- 
joyed the European tour so far?’* 

“Leave her out of this,” he 
managed to say. But his tone 
was defensive. 

“Poor Mullen,” I sighed. “She’s 
still keeping the reins on you, 
huh? I pity you, feller. I know 
just how it is. I’m under the Iron 
High Heel myself. You’ll have 
to meet my wife sometime.” 

“This is too much! Two of you? 
Too damned much I A double 
haunt!” Mullen frowned. Then he 
began to laugh at his own sudden 
thoughts, “How do you make 
out, mister?” 

I considered explaining to him, 
but decided he’d never under- 
stand. “Wife” was the simplest 
way I could describe “her” — the 
only way in earthly language. 

“Your mind needs deodoriz-

I dumped the chess board and 
pieces on the kitchen table. 

“No," he said. “No! I’ra not 
going to confirm myself in my 
own madness. Take ’em away." 

I started setting out the pieces. 
He watched with a kind of hor- 
rible deadpan fascination. In a 
faraway voice he said; “Queen 
on her own color.” 

“That’s better," I told him. 
“Pull up a chair." 

He went to the kitchen window, 
looked at the soft sunlight glanc- 
ing through the apple trees. He 
looked for quite a while. Then 
he shrugged, grabbed a chair and 
came back to the tabic. 

“Anywhere but Ireland," he 
observed, “I’d have run halfway 
to Thaughbeen by now.” 

Twice during the game, which 
stretched out over three hours, 
he tried to make talk, but I 
dodged the questions. Once he 
made a grab in the air over my 
QKt as I was making a move. 

“Can you,” 1 asked politely, 
“feel a magnetic field? Or an air- 
current, if your hand is moving 
with it? Or put a half-nelson on 
a frame of reference? Or poke 
a De Sitter anti-particle in the 
eye?” 

He gave up. 

Finally, as wc heard the clat- 
tering roar of McGuire’s cartage 
van down the road, he said : “This 
is the damnedest game, in more 
than one sense. Check. Hold it 



until I'm back in this room.** 

I heard them dumping the stuff 
into the hall; and a female voice 
ordering the carter around; and 
the bland, blarneying voice of 
McGuire somehow soaring above 
the authoritative female voice 
and quelling it 

When Mullen came back into 
the kitchen, he looked determined. 
He closed the door carefully be- 
hind him. 

“McGuire," he said, “is a 
breath of fresh air. Sanity re- 
turns. I’ve just realized what I’ve 
been doing all morning. I have 
a hell of a lot of work on hand 
and I can’t get on with it until 
this is straightened out. And I’m 
not going to have my wife scared. 
Now just what arc you, and 
what’s your racket?" 

“Patience, pal," I said. “Fin- 
ish the game, then I’ll talk. I 
fixed you some fresh coffee.” 
Voices were raised again In the 
hall. “Incidentally, I don’t think 
your wife scares easy. She’s busy 
for a while anyway. Your move." 

He gulped coffee, watched me 
interpose on his check and 
threaten his own king simultane- 
ously. He was compelled to ex- 
change pieces, which made it a 
draw. 

“You’ve been playing for that," 
he accused. 

I sighed. “Not deliberately. If 
we played a dozen games, they’d 
end up on a draw. Or a stale- 



SHE WHO LAUGHS 



mate. One or the other.” 

“I don’t get it. Quit the cross- 
talk. What are you?” 

H e sat more easily in his chair. 

He frowned at the coffee. I 
hoped I hadn’t laced it too much. 
He’d get the idea soon enough 
anyway. 

“You’ve got a couple of books 
in your bag.” I said. “One is a 
pretty detailed family history of 
this place, written and published 
at his own expense — because no 
one else would be interested — ^by 
Mister Patrick O’Rourke. Gen- 
tleman, at the turn of the century. 
^ “There are only passing, depre- 
catory references to me in tliat. 
He never took kindly to the idea 
of family banshee, or banshees. 
The other was written twenty 
years ago by an earnest and sober 
investigator from the English 
Psychical Research Society. It’s 
my biography. My wife, being 
what you’d call plumb lazy, never 
made an appearance for him. I’ve 
often regretted that the Society 
never got around to following up 
his report. I’d have shown ’em 
plenty.” 

“Th^n you are a haunt,” Mul- 
len said. “A plain, ornery haunt! 
But how do you tick? How do 
you move things around?” 

“A disembodied psyche — ” I 
began. 

That got him. He snapped up 
straight and mouthed for breath. 



Coffee slopped over the table. It 
didn’t matter. He’d drunk enough 
for my purpose. 

“A disembodied psyche,” I re- 
peated firmly, “which is a focus 
of consciousness freed from hin- 
dering matter, and thus from the 
bonds of inertia and entropy, not 
to mention sex, can be a pretty 
powerful thing. It doesn’t upset 
any energy balance because it 
utilizes extant potentials.” 

His eyes were growing rounder. 
He tried to get up, then slumped 
back. 

“You soon master the mechan- 
ics of perception for yourself,” I 
said. “It’s largely a matter of 
that curious mental force called 
imagination. And you learn how 
to induce illusion in others. But 
it takes about ten years before 
you find a way to store enough 
free energy from cosmic sources 
in your own field-web of anti- 
particles to move solid objects 
around.” 

He had trouble with his voice. 
“Ten years? Ten year from 
when?" 

“From pretty damn soon,” I 
said sweetly. 

“Then you’re — you're — ” He 
gvdped. His eyes were glazing. 

“That’s right,” I said. “Sleep 
tight, brother.” 

I was testing the last circuit 
when he came around. He opened 
his eyes nnd moaned a little. 

“Don’t worry about the slight

hangover,*' I said. “1*11 be taking 
it over in a moment.” 

He looked around at the setup. 
Only his head could move. The 
rest of him was tied pretty firmly 
in the stasis area. 

“?*rctty neat, huh?” I said. “It 
would have taken you months. 
Years, maybe. It probably did— 
once. That’s something I’ve never 
figured out. It took me four hours 
flat.*even with the know-how. I 
had two hundred years to work 
it out.” 

Mullen muttered: “It’s a 

dream.” 

“Check. That’s how the thing 
started, if it ever did start. With 
Dunne’s theories of precognition 
and post-cognition in dreams — 
a freed psyche moving backward 
and forward in time. Or, as in 
this case, staying put and letting 
time flow by. No mass, so no 
trouble with entropy or inertia. 
All the paradoxes of time travel 
smoothed out.” 

He’d gone bug-eyed again. I 
could almost see his brain wrig- 
gling. 

“What happens when I — when 
you — when this body dies?” 

“You answered that question 
when you devised the math,” I 
said. “Does the past die? No. 
It’s co-existent. Effective immor- 
tality.” 

“But death — ” 

“Is pretty final,” I agreed. 
"Dust to dust, ct cetera. And 



since we don’t believe in an after- 
life, that makes it a tough prob- 
lem. But you’ve got a couple of 
centuries to figure that one out, 
too.” 

“You mean you have figured 
it?” 

■“I didn’t. You didn’t. We 
didn’t. We never will because wc 
never have.” 

“How many times has this hap- 
pened?” 

“Once,” I said patiently. “This 
is the first time. It always is.'* 

“But with memory of this con- 
versation, I can change the pat- 
tern! I can — ” 

Then he got the idea. His 
mouth dropped open. Slack* 
jawed dope . 

“That’s it,” I said. I felt sorry 
for him, as usual. “You’ve al- 
ready tried everything. You can’t 
even leave the place until this 
turns up.” I prodded his stomach. 
“It’s the only body our psychic 
matrix will fit into, and there’s 
a psychic compulsion to stay right 
here until it arrives. You can’t 
lick time. You never could.” 

T STOOD by the switch. The 
* tubes began to heat up. 

“No!” he yelled. “Hold it! 
About my wife — ” 

“Our wife,” I corrected him, 
looking around cautiously. This 
time I might get away with it. 
Maybe the pattern wouldn’t al- 
ways be the same. It was worth

trying anyway. “You’ll find her 
on the Tenth Plane when you 
figure out how to get there." 

I gave him the wave-off sign. 
"I’ve got a date with a bottle of 
Jamieson’s Irish whisky and a 
fishing rod. By the way, when 
you meet up with old Johnnie 
Maur again, give him my love. 
He won’t understand. He never 
does. Look out for his rook game 
in the end-play. So long, sucker," 
I said. "Good haunting." 

I WAS reaching for the switch, 

when — 

"Hold it or I’ll blast you!” 

I sighed resignedly and looked 
at the cellar steps. A body 
slumped inelegantly into view, 
dangling like a puppet from in- 
visible strings. 

The voice came from above its 
head. 

How I hate that voice! 

"E>ear, sweet Bernic,” cooed 
my wife dangerously. "Trying it 
again? Don’t you ever learn? 
If you touch that switch before 
my say-so, I’ll fry that body of 
yours as soon as spit in your 
eye." 

Mullen choked : "That’s Betty I" 
"Uh-huh,” I murmured. “And 
that’s Betty’s body. She wants it 
back. I always try to leave her 
behind, but I guess I never suc- 
ceed. I’d like to try living with a 
wife I haven’t lived with for two 
hundred years. But she’s spent 



months soaking up energy on the 
Tenth Plane, and if I don’t play 
ball, she’ll burn my body before 
I get it." 

"How right, darling,” said 
Betty. Arsenic and molasses in 
that voice. "Now tie this down in 
the stasis field." 

I looked at the limp, blonde 
head and laughed. "I suppose you 
whanged her with the skillet 
again?" 

"That’s my headache,” the 
voice snapped. 

"Right! Thait’s why I’m laugh- 
ing, sweetheart.” 

I laid Betty’s unconscious head 
near Mullen’s — that is, near my 
shoulder. She stirred a little and 
moaned. I passed ropes over her 
and through the ring-bolt of the 
time lock and stood back admir- 
ing the scene. 

"Don’t we look sweet?" I said. 

"Beautiful," said Betty. "Now 
pull that switch.” . 

I went to the handle. 

“No—" pleaded Mullen. 

"Yes," ordered Betty. 

I pulled. 

For a milU‘Secot\d, a soft, im-

R [CHARD Falk was « sane 
man. Up until three weeks 
. ago he had been, so far as 
he had been able to discover, the 
only sane man left in a world of 
lunatics. 

Now he was a dead man. 

He lay in a metal coffin twenty 
yards long by three wide, airless, 
soundless. Behind the faceplate of 
his helmet, under the rime of sub- 
zero air. his lips were bright blue, 
bis cheeks, nose, forehead a lighter 
color, almost violet. The flesh was 
stiff as frozen leather. He did not 
move, breathe, or think; he was 
dead. 

Beside him, strapped to the 
bulging torso of his suit, was a 
metal box labeled: 



SCATO HEART PROBE 

See Instructions Inside 



All around him. strapped tight 
to the walls by broad loops of 
webbing, were boxes, cannisters, 
canv^ bags, kegs. Cargo. His cof- 
fin was a freighter, going to Mars, 
and he was a frozen stowaway 
aboard it. 

In his brain the memories were 
neatly stacked, just as he had left 
them, not coupled now, each cell 
isolated, the entropy of his mind 
fallen to zero. But uppermost 
among them, waiting for the thaw 
that might never come, wert the 
memories of his last few hours of 
life.

Oncf the ship was launched 
nd free, after he had slipped into 



. he had had to wait until its 
'ancing molecules had stilled, 
\eir heat all radiated away into 
pace. Then to wait again, heater 
urned off, listening to the silence 



hile his own life’s heat drained 
way: fingers and toes numb first, 
ars and nose following, then lips, 
hceks and all his flesh. Shivering 
i an agony of cold, he had 
atched his breath fill the helmet 
vith cloud, the cold drops bcad- 
ng on the colder faceplate. 

Tricky business, one that de- 
iianded courage. Act too soon, 
md the final drop into stillness 
vould be too slow — the freezing 
iqui^s in his body would crys- 
alize, gashing his cells with a 
nillion tiny ice needles. Wait too 
ong, and the cold would steal his 
jutonomy: the order would go 
jut along his dendrites, “Act!” 
md there would be no response. 

He had waited until the false 
varmth of the dying had crept 

>ver him. the subtle destroyer 

rumbering his limbs not w'ith 

larshness but with too much 



leacc. Twisting then in the dead 
•enter where he floated, he had 
Irawn himself into the lane bc- 
ween two looped bundles of 
argo. forcing them aside, until 
ic reached the naked hull. There, 
prcad-cagled against the chill 
metal, embracing it as one who 
:rucifies himself glady. he died. 



The ship, stillest of sepulchers, 
hung fixed in- the center of the 
starry globe. So it might have 
remained for time without end. 
changeless, knowing no time, for 
there was no time here. The ship 
and all its contents — - except its 
robot control, inactive now but 
warmed by a minute trickle of 
electrons — were very nearly at 
zero absolute. 

A RELAY clicked, communi- 
cating tremor through support 
frame and girder and hull. Time 
had begun again. The radar as- 
sembly in the prow began to emit 
timed clusters of radiation. Pres- 
ently other relays snapped over, 
and then the engine awoke, whis- 
pered to itself an instant, and was 
silent. For an instant the ship 
had become once more a thing in 
motion, a pebble flung between 
the stars. Another such instant 
came, and another; then, at long 
last, the hull shuddered to the 
whip and carom of atmospheric 
molcculc.s. Lightly it dipped into 
Martian air, out again, in again, 
making a great braking circuit of 
the globe. A final relay clicked, 
and Falk’s ■ coffin of a freighter 
hurled itself groundward, free of 
the skeletal ship whose rockets 
now flamed again, driving it back 
into the timeless deep. 

A parachute opened as the 
cargo hull hurtled downward: a 
preposterous parasol that w'ould

not have held the weight for a 
minute against Earth’s gravity, in 
Earth’s air. But here it slowed 
that plummeting fall until the 
box met Martian sand not quite 
at killing speed. 

In the shell of the motionless 
freighter, Falk’s corpse slowly 
thawed. 

~l"riS heart was beating. That 
was Falk’s first conscious 
realization, and he listened to the 
tiny sound thankfully. His chest 
was rising and falling in a deep, 
slow rhythm; he heard the hiss 
and whisper of breath in his 
nostrils, and felt the veins pulse 
at his temples. 

Then came a prickling half pain 
in his arms and legs. He saw a 
ruddy haze of light on his closed 
lids. 

Falk opened his eyes to a pale 
glow that turned itself into a face. 
It went briefly, then came back. 
Falk could see it a little better 
now. Young, about thirty, pale- 
skinned, with H blue beard- 
shadow. Black, straight hair, a 
little untidy. Black-rimmed spec- 
tacles. Ironic lines on either side 
of the thin mouth. 

“All right now?’’ said the face. 

Falk murmured, “Think so.*’ 

The young man nodded. He 
picked up something from the bed 
and began talking it apart, fitting 
tire components into the cushion- 
ed troughs of a metal box. It was 

TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



the heart probe, Falk saw: the 
bulky control box, the short, 
capillary -thin needle. 

“Where did you get this?" the 
young man asked. “And what 
the devil were you doing aboard 
that freighter?” 

“Stole the probe,” mumbled 
Falk. “And the suit, and the rest 
of the stuff. Dumped enough 
cargo to match my weight. Want- 
ed to get to Mars. Only way was 
to stow aboard.” “You stole it?” 
the man repeated incredulously. 
“Then you never had the ana- 
logue treatment?” 

Falk smiled. “Had it. all right. 
Dozen times. Never took.” He 
felt very tired. “Let me rest a 
minute, will you?" 

“Of course. Sorry.” 

The young man went away, 
and Falk closed his eyes; he went 
through those last hours once, 
painful as they were, and then 
again. There was trauma there; 
mustn’t let it get buried, to cause 
him trouble later. Accept it, know 
the fear, live with it. 

After a wliilc the young man 
came back, carrying broth that 
steamed in a cup. and Falk 
drank it gratefully. Then he fell 
unknowing into sleep. 

When he awoke, he was strong- 
er. He tried to sit up and found, 
to his mild surprise, that he could. 
The other, who had been sitting 
in an armchair across the room, 
put down his pipe and came over 

1S7 



to thrust pillows behind Falk's 
back. Then he sat down again. 
The room was cluttered and had 
a stale odor. Floor, wall and 
ceiling were enameled metal. 
There were books and rolls of 
tape, records, in shelves: more 
piled on the floor. A dirty shirt 
was hanging from the doorknob. 

“Want to talk now?” the young 
man asked. “My name’s Wolfert.” 

“Glad to know you. Mine’s 
Falk. You want to know about 
the analogue business first, I 
suppose.” 

"And why you’re here." 

"They’re the same thing,” Falk 
told him. “I’m immune to ana- 
logue treatment. I didn’t know it 
for sure till I was ten, but I think 
I wass born that way. From 
seven on, I remember the other 
kids talking about their Guard- 
ians, and me pretending I had 
one. too. You know how kids 
are — anything to be part of 
the gang. 

“But for a long time, years, I 
wasn’t certain whether everyone 
else was pretending like me. or 
whether I really was the only one 
without an invisible Guardian 
to talk to. 1 was pretty sure the 
kids were lying when they said 
they could sec theirs, but whether 
they were there at all or not was 
another question. I didn’t know; 
actually it didn't bother me much. 
A kid that age doesn’t distinguish 
readily between fact and fantasy. 



“When I was ten, 1 stole some* 
thing. It was a book I wanted, 
which my father wouldn’t let me 
have. The clerk was looking the 
other way; I put it under my 
jacket. Funny, I was halfway 
out before it struck me that I’d 
i^st proved I had no Guardian. 
By that time, you see. I’d de- 
cided that I’d just never seen 
mine, because I'd never done 
an3Tthing bad. I was proud of 
that, a little prissy about it if 
you want the truth. I only wanted 
this book. 

“I had sense enough, tliank 
God, to burn that book after I’d 
finished reading it. If I hadn’t, 
1 don’t suppose 1 would have 
lived to grow up.” 

“Should think not,” Wolfert 
said, his eyes fixed on Falk, alert, 
wary. “One man without any 
control could turn the whole 
applecart over. But I thought 
immunity was theoretically im- 
possible.” 

“Tve thought about that a good 
deal. According to classic psych- 
olc^gy* it is. I’m not unusually 
resistant to hypnotic drugs; I 
go under all right. But the censor 
mechanism just doesn’t respond. 
I've had the notion that I may be 
a mutation, developed in re- 
sponse to the analogue treatment 
as an anti-survival factor. But I 
don't know. As far as I’ve ever 
been able to find out, there are no 
more like me.” 






GALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



“Umm,” said Wolfert, puffing 
at his pipe. “Should think youf 
next move would be to get mar- 
ried, have children, see if they 
were immune, too." 

Falk stared at him soberly. 
“Wolfert, can you imagine your- 
self settling down happily in a 
community of maniacs?” 

other’s face flushed. He 
took the pipe out of his mouth, 
looked down at it. Finally he said, 
“All right, I know what you 
mean.” 

“Maybe you don’t,” said Falk, 
thinking, I've offended him. 
Couldn’t help it. “You’ve been 
out here ten years, haven’t you?” 

Wolfert nodded, 

“Things are getting worse,” 
Falk told him. “I’ve taken the 
trouble to look up some statis- 
tics. They weren’t hard to find; 
the damned fools are proud of 
them. The number of persons in 
mental institutions has gone 
steadily down since 1980, when 
tlie worldwide analogue program 
got under way. Extension of ana- 
logue program has gone steadily 
up. The two curves cancel out 
perfectly. 

“There are fewer and fewer 
people who have to be put away 
in madhouses — not because of 
any improvement in therapy, but 
because the analogue techniques 
are getting better and better. The 
guy who would have been hope- 



lessly insane fifty years ago now 
has a little man inside his head, 
controlling him, making him act 
normal. On the outside, he is 
normal; inside, he’s a raving mad- 
man. Worse still, the guy who 
would have been just a little bit 
cracked, fifty years ago — and 
gotten treatment for it — is now 
just as mad as the first guy. It 
doesn’t matter any more. We 
could all be maniacs and the 
world would go on just as before.” 
Wolfert grimaced wryly. “Well? 
It’s a peaceful world, anyhow.” 
“Sure,” said Falk. “No war or 
possibility of war, no murders, 
no theft, no crime at all. That’s 
because every one of them has a 
policeman inside his skull. But 
action begets reaction, Wolfert, 
in psychiatry as in physics. A 
prison is a place to get out of, if 
it takes you a lifetime. Push one 
plunger down, another will rise. 
Just a few years more, I think — 
ten or twenty, say — and you’ll 
see that madhouse curve rise 
again. Because there’s no escape 
from the repression of the Guard- 
ians except a further retreat into 
insanity. And eventually a point 
is reached where no amount of 
treatment can help. What arc 
they going to do then?” 

Wolfert tamped his pipe out 
slowly and stood up. “Meaning 
the psychiatrists who really gov- 
ern Earth, I suppose. You’ve 
evidently figured out what you’re 



ticKET t6 Anywhere * 



going to do about all this." 

Falk smiled. “Yes. With your 
help, I’m going to the stars.” 
The other stood frozen a mo- 
ment. “So you know about that,*' 
he said. “Well, come into the next 
room, ril show it to you.” 

F alk had known about the 
Doorway, but not that it 
looked like this. It was a cubicle 
of something that looked like 
slick brown glass, ten feet high, 
six wide and deep. Inside, at waist 
level on the far wall, a lever, 
curiously shaped, like the head of 
an old-fashioned walking-stick, 
the slightly curved bar of the L 
parallel tp the wall. Nothing more 
than that. The floor of Wolfert’s 
hut ha^ been assembled around 
it. It was the reason for the hut’s 
existence, for Wolfert’s dearly 
bought presence on Mars. 

“So that’s it,” said Falk. He 
took a step forward. 

“Stay where you are." Wolfert 
said sharply. “The area in front 
of the entrance is boobytrapped." 

Falk stopped and looked at 
Wolfert, then at the metal cab- 
inets bolted to the floor on cither 
side of the Doorway. Now that 
he looked at them closely, he 
could see the ler^s of black- 
light beams, and above them, 
metal ones that he guessed were 
discharge points. 

Wolfert cpnfirmed it “If any- 
thing ever comes out, the current 

140 



is supposed to get him. If it does- 
n’t, I'm here.” He put his hand 
on the rapid-fire automatic at his 
belt. 

Falk sat down slowly on a 
bench next to the wall. “Why 
are they so afraid of whatever 
might come out of the Doorway?” 

“You don’t know the whole 
story, then. Tell me what you do 
know and I’ll fill in the gaps.” 

“The first Mars expedition, in 
'76, found it here. Apparently it 
was known to be an interstellar 
transportation system, but as far 
as I could learn, nobody ever 
actually tried it out. I knew that 
a caretaker had been left here — 
your predecessor, I imagine — 
after the idea of colonizing Mart 
wa& abandoned. But I didn’t 
know any of the reasons.” 

Wolfert grinned briefly and 
leaned against the wall. “It’s a 
transportation system, all right. 
Put an object in that cubicle, 
press the lever down, the object 
vanishes. So does most of the 
crowbar or whatever you use to 
work the lever. Ffft — gone. 

"We don’t know how old it is 
and have no way of telling. The 
material it’s made of is a hell 
of a lot harder than diamond. 
About half of it is underground. 
That was the way it was found, 
sitting perfectly level on the sur- 
face of the desert. 1 believe it 
must t^aye.sqme sort pf self-level- 
ing mechanism built into it, so 



that it’s always available no 
matter what changes the surface 
of the planet goes through. 

• “Other ruins have been found 
on Mars, but they're all stone and 
quite primitive; nothing like this. 
The first expedition tried to get 
into its innards and find out what 
made it go, of course, but they 
couldn’t. You can see in, only 
there’s nothing to sec." He gave 
his quick, ironic smile. “It’s 
frustrating. Makes a physicist 
feel like a backward student in a 
kindergarten. We know that it’s 
part of an interstellar network. 
One man did try it out — a mem- 
ber of the first expedition. He saw 
the cubicle and the lever, stepped 
in and pressed it to find out what 
would happen. He found out, 
all right, but I don’t suppose the 
rest of us will ever know. 

“Then the second expedition 
brought along a batch of powerful 
all -wave senders and put tliem 
through. They picked up the first 
signal five years later, from the 
general direction of the star Reg- 
ulus. Two more after seven years, 
then four during the thirteenth 
year, all from different directions. 
The other eight have yet to be 
heard from.” 

He looked at Falk. “Now do 
you understand? The thing has 
no selectivity. It’s completely ran- 
dom. We could walk through 
there and step out onto the planet 
of another star but it might take 



us a million years to find the 
way back by trial and error.” 

Falk leaned back against the 
wall, trying to absorb the idea. 
“Maybe there are only a dozen 
or so stars in the network.” he 
suggested. 

“Don’t be a fool. Would the 
race that could build (hat stop 
at a dozen stars, or a thousand? 
They owned the Galaxy! Sixty 
billion stars. According to current 
theory, all the main ones have 
planets.” 

He pointed to the Doorway. 
“Three hundred sixty cubic feet 
about.” he said. “Enough for one 
man and supplies for a year, or 
fifteen people and supplies for a 
month. That’s the limit to the size 
of the colony we could send out. 
With no assurance,” he added 
bitterly, “that they’d land any- 
where they could live for a min- 
ute.” 

“Frustrating,” Falk agreed. 
“But I still don’t See why you're 
here with a gun. I can understand 
that if a member of the race that 
built that thing came through^ 
and I must say it seems unlikely 
— that would be an important 
event. But why kill him when he 
steps out?” 

“It isn’t my policy, Falk. I 
only work here.” 

“I understand that. But do you 
have any idea what’s behind the 
policy?” 

“Fear. They’ve got too much 



TICKET TO ANYWHERE

at stakf.” Wolfert leaned against 
the wall again, gesturing with his 
pipestem. “Do you realize that 
we could have interstellar col- 
onization without this gadget, on 
our own? Give us a fuel source 
efficient enough so that we can 
accelerate continuously for as 
long as eight months, and we 
could reach the stars well within a 
man’s lifetime. But do you know 
why we won’t? They’re even 
afraid to plant colonies here on 
Mars, or op Jupiter’s moons, 
simply because transportation 
takes too long. Imagine a colony 
cut off from Earth by a five or ten 
year trip. Say something goes 
wrong — a man like yourself, nat- 
urally immune to analogue treat- 
ment. Or a man who somehow 
evade? the treatment, then man- 
ages to take it over, change it. Say 
he cuts out the one directive, 
‘You must do nothing against 
the policy or interests of Earth.' 
Then you’ve got two communities 
again, not one. And then?” 

Falk nodded soberly. “War. 
They don’t dare take even the 
smallest chance of that.” 

“It isn’t a question of daring; 
they can't. That’s one of the di- 
rectives in their own conditioning, 
Falk.” 

“So we’ll never get to the stars.” 

“Unless,” said Wolfert, “some- 
body comes through that Door- 
way who understands how it 
works. The voltage is high, but 



not high enough to kill — humans, 
that is. He’s supposed to be stun- 
ned, and if the current doesn’t 
stop him and he tries to get back 
into the Doorway, I’m supposed 
to shoot to cripple. But at all 
events, he isn’t to be allowed to 
go back and warn others to stay 
away from this station. Because 
if we knew how to alter the 
system so that it would be sel- 
ective — ” 

“Then we’d have colonies,” fin- 
ished Falk. “Every one just 
around the corner from Earth. All 
just alike. The loonies shall in- 
herit the Universe. I hope no- 
body ever comes through.” 

H e prowled the rest of the 
cabin with Wolfert, resting at 
intervals until his strength re- 
turned. There wasn’t much to sec: 
the Doorway room, with a spy- 
hole Falk had not noticed be- 
tween it and the bedroom; the 
room that housed radio, radar 
and the computer that controlled 
the grazing orbits of the supply 
rockets; the power plant, and the 
compressor that kept the cabin’s 
air at breathable pressure; kit- 
chen, bathroom, and two storage 
chambers. 

The radio room had a window, 
Falk stood there a long time, 
looking out over the alien desert, 
violet now as tlie sun dropped to- 
ward the horizon. Stars glittered 
with unfamiliar brilliance in the 



142 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



near-black, near-vacuum sky. 

In his mind he sketched hair- 
lines of fire across the sky, a cat’s- 
cradle of stars. The thought that 
tomorrow he would be standing 
on a planet of one of those suns 
was frightening, but at the same 
time it lured him. He felt like 



Wolfert said abruptly,. “You 
haven’t asked me whether I re- 
ported to Earth when I found 
you in that freighter shell.” 
Falk looked at him. *T’ll be 
gone long before they can do 
anything about me.” 

“What made you so sure that 




a boy standing on the edge of an 
unsounded pool, whose black 
waters might hold treasure or

yet he knew that he must. 

How could a man feel other-

the way was open, that he had 
only to step forward? 



I’d be — S5rmpathetic?” 

“You’re a volunteer. They 
haven’t got to the stage of con- 
ditioning people to do jobs they 
don't want to do, though I sup- 
pose they will eventually. You’re 
a hermit. You don’t like the mad- 
house they’re making out of Earth 
any more than I do.”

“I don’t know,” said Wolfert. 
“Perhaps you’re assuming too 
much similarity. I don’t feel as 
you do about the analogue sys- 
tem, or the present government. 
I can see that it will lead to dis- 
aster eventually, but that doesn’t 
bother me much. I'll be dead. But 
1 want the stars. That’s an em- 
otional thing with me. There 
are no slugs in these cartridges.” 
He indicated the gun at his hip. 
“Or in any of the ammunition 
I’ve got. They didn’t condition 
me against that.” 

“Lqpk,” Falk said abruptly, 
“you’ve got a directive against 
stepping through that Doorway. 
Is that right?” 

The other nodded. 

but is there any reason 
why T couldn’t knock you over 
the head and drag you through?” 
Wolfert smiled wryly, shaking 
his head. “Somebody’s got to stay 
at this end.” 

“Why?” 

“Because there’s a chance that 
you’ll find the secret out there, 
somewhere. That’s what you’re 
hoping, too, isn’t it? You're not 
just looking for a place to hide — 
you could do that in a thousand 
places on Earth. You’re after 
knowledge, and in spite of what 
I’ve told you, you’re hoping you’ll 
be able to bring it back and 
make the Earth over.” 

“It sounds a little Messianic,” 
said Falk, “but you're right.” 



Wolfert shrugged, letting his 
gaze drift away again. “Well, 
then, there’s got to be somebody 
here. Somebody with no slugs in 
his gun. If I went with you, 
they’d take good care to send a 
different sort of man next time.” 
He met Falk’s eyes again briefly. 
“Don’t waste time feeling sorry 
for me. You may not believe it, 
but I’m quite happy here. When 
I’m alone, that is,” 

Falk had been wondering why 
the government had not sent a 
married couple instead of a single 
man, who might go mad from 
sheer loneliness. Now it struck 
him that he had been stupid. 
When a man has a wife, he’s no 
longer a hermit. After a moment 
Falk said, “Wolfert, I Hke you 
better than any man I’ve ever 
met. I hope you’ll believe that." 

Wolfert hauled out a pipe- 
cleaner, a complicated thing of 
many hinged stems, the free ends 
stamped into shovel-shapes, tam- 
per-shapes, probes. He said, 'Tm 
afraid I dislike you, Falk, but it’s 
nothing personal. I hate your guts 
because you’re the master of your 
own mind.” 

He turned and put out his 
hand, grinning. “Aside from that, 
I think you’re a great guy.” 

Falk gripped his hand. “I hope 
you’re here when I get back.” 
‘Til. be here,” said Wolfert, 
scraping his pipe bowl, “for an- 
other thirty-odd years, barring 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



accidents. If you’re not back by 
then, I don’t suppose you’ll be 
coming back at all.” 

II 

A T his suggestion, Falk put on 
one of Wolfert’s light Mars 
suits instead of the spacesuit he 
had worn in the freighter. The 
latter, designed for heavy-duty 
service in the orbital space station 
that circled Earth, was, as Wol- 
fert pointed out, too clurpsy for 
use on a planet’s surface. The 
lighter suit furnished adequate 
protection in thin atmosphere, 
and was equipped with gadgetry 
that the other lacked: a head- 
lamp. climbing gear, built-in 
compass, and food, water and 
disposal devices. It carried air 
tanks, but also had a compression 
outfit — which, given an atmos- 
phere at least no poorer in oxygen 
than that of Mars, would keep the 
wearer alive for as long as the 
batteries held out. 

“You’ll have to find a place 
where you can live off the land,” 
said Wolfert. “If all the planets 
.you hit should happen to be dead, 
so will you be, very shortly. But 
this suit will giVe you longer to 
look, at least. I’d give you this 
gun, but it wouldn’t do you any 
good without ammunition.” 

He disconnected the boobytrap 
and stood aside as Falk went to 
the entrance of the doorway. Falk

took one last look around at the 
bare metal room, and at Wolfert’s 
spare figure and gloomy face. He 
stepped into the brown-glass cu- 
bicle and put his gloved hand on 
the lever. 

“See you,” he said. 

Wolfert nodded soberly. 

Falk turned on his helmet 
lamp, rested his free hand near 
the control box at his belt and 
pressed the lever down. 

Wolfert vanished. An instant 
later Falk was aware that the 
lever was no longer beneath his 
hand. He turned, dazedly, and 
saw that it was back in its origi- 
nal position. 

Then he remembered the curi- 
ous blank that had taken Wol- 
fert's place, and he turned again 
to the entrance. He saw gray- 
white blankness, featureless, un- 
communicative. Was this some 
kind of intermediary stat£? If so, 
how long did it last? He felt a 
surge of panic as he recalled that 
it was only assumption that the 
journey was instantaneous, and 
another as he thought of the eight 
transmitters that had never been 
heard from. 

He gripped the edge of the 
doorway and bent forward, look- 
ing downward, seeing only a 
chaos of dim colors of which his 
eye made nothing. Then he saw 
the cliff, and all the rest of the 
scene fell into perspective. 

He stood at the top of a sheer 

MS 



mountain — an impossible, ridicu- 
lous height. Whatever was at the 
bottom melted into a meaningless 
tapestry of grayed color. He 
looked to right and left, and saw 
nothing else. No sound came 
through the diaphragm of his hel- 
met. He had only the tactile and 
muscular responses of his own 
body, and the hard reality of the 
Doorway itself, to assure him that 
he was real and alive. 

The planet was dead. He felt 
irrationally sure of it. There was 
not even a whisper of wind; only 
the featureless blanket of gray 
cloud, the cliff, the meaningless 
colors below. 

He looked at the kit slung to 
his belt: the pressure gauge, bot- 
tled litmus papers, matches. But 
there %as no point in testing this 
atmosphere. Even if it were 
breathable, there was no way of 
getting out of the Doorway, for 
the cliff began not more than an 
inch from the entrance. 

Falk went back to the lever, 
psessed it down again. 

This time he watched it as it 
reached the end of its stroke. 
There was no hint of transition. 
The lever was there, under his 
hand, and then it was back in 
the starting position. 

He turned. 

Deep blue night, blazing with 
stars. Underneath, a flat blue- 
green waste that ran straight 
away into the far distance. 



Falk stepped out onto the icy 
plain and looked around him, 
then upward. The sky was so like 
the one he had known as a boy 
in Michigan that it struck him al- 
most as a conviction that this ter- 
minus was on Earth — in the Ant- 
arctic, perhaps, near the pole, 
where no explorer had ever hap- 
pened across it. Then, as he 
looked automatically for the Dip- 
per, Orion’s Belt, the Southern 
Cross, he knew that he was 
wrong. 

Directly above him was a 
group of eight stars, two of them 
very brilliant, four arranged in a 
straight line, the rest spread out 
in an almost perfect semicircle. 
Falk knew that if he had ever 
seen that constellation before, he 
would not have forgotten it. 

Now he looked down toward 
the horizon, blacker than the sky. 
How could he know that light, 
warmth, safety, knowledge were 
not hiding just beyond the curve 
of the planet? 

He turned back to the cubicle. 
He was here on sufferance, a man 
in a Mars suit, with weeks— or, 
with great luck, months or years 
— to live. He had to find what he 
sought within a pitifully small 
radius from the Doorway. 

Down went the lever again. 
Now it was still night, but when 
Falk went to the Doorway, he 
saw an avenue of great buildings 
under the stars.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The air pressure gauge came 
out for the first time, low. but 
the compressor could handle it. 
The litmus papers — negative. The 
match burned weakly, and only 
for an instant, but it burned. 

Falk started the compressor 
and shut off the flow of air from 
the tanks slung at his back. Then 
he turned on his helmet light and 
marched off down the avenue. 

P YRAMID, cone, and wedge- 
shape, the buildings all sloped 
away as they rose, so that, for all 
their enormous bulk, they did not 
hide the sky. Falk looked up 
when he had taken a few steps, 
unreasonably expecting to see the 
half-circle constellation. But it 
was not there, and he realized 
witli a shock that for all he knew, 
he mijdit be halfway across the 
Galaxy from the spot where he 
had stood five minutes ago. 

drew a picture of the Gal- 
axy in his mind, an oval lens of 
stars against blackness. Near one 
focus of the ellipse he put a dot 
of brightness that stood for Sol. 
Then he made another dot. and 
drew a shining line between them. 
Then another dot, and another 
line: then another. They made 
a sprawling letter N across the 
misty oval. 

It was incomprehensible. A race 
that could span the Galaxy, but 
could not choose one destination 
from another? 



The only other alternative was 
that there was some function of 
the Doorway which men had 
failed to grasp, some method of 
selection that evaded them, as a 
savage might be bewildered in a 
modern tubeway system. But 
Falk’s mind rejected that. The 
mechanism was simple, clear. A 
cubicle and a lever. Function is 
expressed by shape and the shape 
of the Doorway said “Go.” It did 
not say “Where?” 

He looked again at the build- 
ings. The upper quarter of them, 
he saw now, was badly eroded : 
layers inches deep had been eaten 
away. He glanced at the fine 
orange sand that paved the ave- 
nue and saw that it filled door- 
ways almost to the top. 

The space between tlic sand 
and the tops of the doorways was 
narrow, but he thought he could 
squeeze through. He picked out 
one, centering it in the brilliant 
disk of his headlamp, and stood 
there, in the middle of the avenue, 
reluctant to move. 

He glanced back at the cubicle, 
as if for reassurance. It was still 
there, comfortably clear and 
sharp-lined, timeless. Now he re- 
alized what was troubling him. 
This city was dead — dead as the 
planet of the cliff, or the planet 
of ice. The buildings were stone; 
they had crumbled under the 
weather. 

Their makers were dust, 

i4r

He had agreed with Wolfert 
that he was on a quest for knowl- 
edge, that he hoped the Doorway 
would eventually take him back 
to Sol, armed with knowledge, 
ready to remake the world. But 
it wasn’t true. That had been his 
conscious idea, and it was a 
dream, a self-delusion, an excuse. 

He had no love for Earth, no 
conviction that humanity must 
be rescued. If that force had 
driven him, there would have 
been no logic in leaving. He could 
have stayed, worked himself into 
the governing elite, organized a 
change from within. His chance 
of success would have been small, 
but there would have been a 
chance. 

Yes, he might have done it, 
and ^ for what? Uncontrolled, 
mankind was not fit to colonize. 
Controlled, it dared not take the 
risk. 

But there had been another 
civilization that had been worthy 
of the stars, for it had conquered 
them. Falk did not believe it was 
dead. Stone crumbled, metal 
rusted, yet the Doorways still 
lived, still functioned, defying 
time. But that race was not here; 
it had left no trace of itself ex- 
cept the Doorway. 

Without another glance at the 
buildings around him, Falk 
turned and went back to the 
brown-glass cubicle. 

When he was three yards away 



from it, he saw the footprints. 

There were five of them, lightly 
impressed into the sand near the 
Doorway’s entrance. Even with 
a careful search, Falk could not 
find any more. Two, apparently, 
pointed away from the cubicle; 
the other three were the returning 
trail, for one overlapped one of 
the previous set. 

They were smaller than Falk’s 
booted prints, oval, slightly flat- 
tened along the sides. Falk stared 
at them as if the mere act of 
looking would make them give up 
more information, but they told 
him nothing. 

They were not human. What, 
though, did that prove? 

They could ba the trace of a 
Doorway builder. Or they could 
have been made by a wanderer 
like himself. 

The bitterest thing of all was 
that, having found the trail, he 
could not follow it. For it led 
through the Doorway — to any 
one of sixty billion suns. 

Falk stepped into the cubicle 
and pressed the lever down once 
more. 

Ill 

W HITE light sealed his eyes 
with pain, and there was a 
vicious torrent of heat. Gasping, 
Falk groped frantically for the 
lever. 

The after-image faded slowly.

He saw night again, and the stars. 
That last one, he thought, must 
have been the planet of a nova. 
How many of those was he likely 
to run into? 

He stepped to the Doorway. A 
wasteland: not a stick, not a 
stone. 

He went back to the lever. 
Light again, of bearable inten- 
sity, and a riot of color outside. 

He saw a bright landscape un- 
der a tropic sun — gray-violet 
mountains in the distance, half- 
veiled by mist; nearer, tall stalks 
that bore heavy leaves and fronds 
of a startling blue-green: and di- 
rectly ahead of him, a broad 
plaza that might have been cut 
from one monstrous boulder of 
jade. On either side were low, 
box-shaped structures of dark 
vitreous material : blue, brown, 
green and red. And in the middle 
of the plaza stood a group of 
slender shapes that were unques- 
tionably alive, sentient. 

Falk’s heart was pounding. He 
stepped behind, the shelter of the 
entrance wall and peered out. 
Curiously, it was not the cluster 
of live things that drew him, but 
the buildings on either side. 

They were made of the same 
enduring, clean-edged substance 
as the Doorway. He had come, by 
blind chance, to the right place 
at last. 

Now he stared at the creatures 
grouped in the middle of the 



plaza. For some reason, they were 
disappointing. They were slender 
S-shapes, graceful enough in re- 
pose; lizard-shapes, upright on 
two legs; pink of belly and umber 
of hack. But in spite of the ban- 
doliers slung from their narrow 
shoulder, in spite of their quick, 
patterned gestures as they spoke 
together, Falk could not convince 
himself that he had found the 
people he sought. 

They were too manlike. 

One turned away while two 
others spoke; came back leaning 
at a passionate angle, thrust him- 
self between the two, gesturing 
wildly. Shouted down, he again 
left, and stalked a half-circle 
around the group. He moved as 
a chicken moves, awkwardly, 
thrusting his long neck forward 
at each step. 

Of the five others, two argued, 
two merely stood with drooping, 
attentive heads and watched: and 
the last kept a little apart, gazing 
around him disdainfully. 

They were funny, as monkeys 
are funny because they resemble 
men. We laugh at our mirrored 
selves. Even the races of man 
laugh at each other, when they 
should feel compassion. 

They're tourists, Falk thought. 
One wants to go to the Lido; an- 
other insists they see the Grand 
Canal first; the third is furious 
with both of them for wasting 
time; the next two are too timid

to interfere, and the last one 
doesn't care. 

He couldn’t imagine what their 
reaction to him would be. They 
might want to take him home as 
a souvenir. He was anxious to get 
into those buildings, but he’d 
have to wait until the creatures 
were out of sight. 

While he waited, he got out his 
atmosphere testing kit. The pres- 
sure gauge showed a trifle less 
than Earth normal; the litmus 
papers did not react; the match 
burned cheerfully, jUst as it 
would have on Earth. Falk 
cracked the helmet valve cau- 
tiously and sniffed. 

After the stale air of the suit, 
the breath he inhaled was so good 
that he could almost taste it. It 
wa% fresh, faintly warm, and 
sweet with flower fragrance. Falk 
opened the helmet seam, tipped 
the helmet back and let the 
breeze wash over his face and 
hair. 

He peered out, and saw with 
sudden dismay that the party 
was trooping directly toward him. 
He ducked his head back inside, 
glanced instinctively at the lever, 
then looked out again. 

They were running now: they 
had seen him. They ran very 
clumsily, heads darting strenu- 
ously forward and back. The one 
in the lead was opening and shut- 
ting his triangular mouth, and 
Falk heard faint yawps. He

leaped out of the cubicle, cut 
sharply to the right, and ran. 

The nearest building with a 
visible --opening, unfortunately, 
was some distance down the line, 
between the lizards and Falk. He 
glanced back when he was half- 
' way there. The lizards were con- 
siderably strung out now, but the 
leader was only a few yards away. 

They were faster than they 
looked. Falk put his head down 
and tried to make his heavy boots 
move in a sprint. Almost to the 
door, he looked back again. The 
lizard was one jump away, ball- 
tipped fingers outspread. 

Falk turned in desperation and, 
as the lizard came up, swung a 
knotted fist to the point of its 
snout. He heard its steam-whistle 
sci1?ech, saw it collapse, and then 
he was diving through the op»en 
door ahead. 

The door closed gently behind 
him — a sheet of glassy substance, 
the* same blue as the walls, glid- 
ing down to seal the opening. 
Through its transparency he 
could see the dark shapes of the 
lizards crowding around, leaning 
to pry at the bottom of the door, 
gesticulating at each other. It was 
plain, at any rate, that the door 
was not going to open for them. 

Whether it would open for him, 
when he wanted it to, was an- 
other matter. 

He looked around him. The 
building was a single room, huge, 



so long and deep that he could 
barely see the far walls. Scattered 
over the floor were boxes or 
chests, racks, shelves, little am- 
biguous mounds. Nearly all the 
objects Falk could see were fash- 
ioned of the same glasslike ma- 
terial. 

There was no dust in the room ; 
but now that Falk thought of it, 
he realized that there had been 
none in any of the Doorways, 
either. How that was done he 
could not conjecture. He went to 
the nearest object, a file or rack, 
formed apparently to take many 
things of diverse shapes and sizes. 
It was a quarter empty now, and 
the remaining contents had a 
jumbled look. 

He picked up an orange-glass 
spindle, full of embedded threads, 
or flaws, that looped in a curious 
pattern from one end to the otlier. 
He put it down, took a hollow 
sphere of opal. It was made in 
halves and seemed to be empty, 
but Falk could find no way to 
take it apart. He replaced it, and 
took a brown object shaped like 
a double crescent with a clear 
fracture plane running diagonally 
through it . 

Half an- hour later, he realized 
that he was not going to find any 
picture-books, or engineering 
manuals, or any one thing that 
would unlock the mystery of the 
Doorway people for him. If there 
were any knowledge to be gained

here, it would have to come from 
the building as a whole.. 

The lizards distracted him. He 
could see them through the walls 
of the building, pressing their 
snouts against the glass, staring 
with little round eyes, gesturing 
at him. 

The group finally broke up, 
leaving only one to guard the 
exit; the others dispersed. Falk 
saw one go into the building di- 
rectly across the plaza. The door 
closed behind him. A little later 
another approached and pounded 
on the door; but it did not open 
until the first lizard came close 
to it inside. Some automatic 
mechanism, beyond Falk’s fath- 
oming, evidently responded to the 
pr^ence or absence of any living 
thing inside each building. When 
the last person left, the door 
stayed open; when another per- 
son entered, it shut and would 
not open for the next unless the 
first person allowed it. 

That added one item to the 
description of the Doorway peo- 
ple that Falk was building in his 
mind. They were not property- 
conscious, not afraid that thieves 
would enter in their absence, for 
the doors stood open when they 
were gone, but they evidently re- 
spected each other’s love of pri- 
vacy. 

Falk had previously thought of 
this building as a vast factory, or 
laboratory, or dormitory — a place 



designed to serve a large number 
of people, anyhow. Now he re- 
vised his opinion. Each building, 
he thought, was the private do- 
main of one person, or, if they 
had family groups, only two or 
three. But how could one person 
or one family use all this space, 
all these possessions? 

He asked himself what a cliff- 
dweller would make of a million- 
aire’s triplex apartment in New 
York. It helped, but not enough. 
The objects around him were all 
specialized tools; they would not 
function for him, and so told him 
nothing about the Doorway 
builders. There was nothing that 
he could compare to a bed, a 
table, a shower bath. He could 
not visualize the people who had 
lived here. 

With an effort, he forced him- 
self to stop thinking in terms of 
men. The facts were important, 
not his prejudices. And then what 
had been a barrier became a road. 
There were no beds, tables, show- 
ers? Then the Doorway people 
did not sleep; they did not eat; 
they did not bathe. 

Probably, thought Falk, they 
did not die. 

The riddle of the deserted 
chamber mocked him. How, hav- 
ing built this city, would they 
leave it? How would they spread 
the network of the Doorways 
across the face of the Galaxy, 
and then leave it unused?

The first question answered it- 
self. Looking at the littered cham- 
ber. Falk thought again of his 
comparison of the cliff-dweller 
and the millionaire. Not a mil- 
lionaire’s triplex, he told himself 
... a tent. 

Once there had been something 
of particular interest on this 
world. No telling what it had 
been, for that had been millions 
of years ago. when Mars was a 
living world. But the Doorway 
people, a few of them, had come 
here to observe it. Finished, they 
had gone away, leaving their tents 
behind, as a man might abandon 
a crude shelter of sticks and 
leaves. 

And the other things they had 
lef^. behind them? The cubes, 
cones, rods, odd shapes, each one 
beyond price to a man? Empty 
cans, thought Falk, toothpasta 
tubes, wrapping paper! 

ri^HE sun was redder, nearer 
the horizon. Falk looked at 
the chronometer strapped to the 
wrist of his suit, and found to 
his surprise that it was more 
than five hours since he had left 
Wolfert on Mars. 

He took food out of his pack 
and looked at the labels on the 
cans. But he was not hungry; he 
did not even feel tired. 

He watched the lizards outside. 
They were scurrying around in 
the plaza now, bringing armloads 



of junk from the building, pack- 
ing them into big red boxes. A 
curious construction floated into 
view down at the far end of the 
plaza. It was a kind of airboat, 
an open shell with two lizards 
riding in it, supported by two 
winglike extensions with stream- 
lined, down-pointing shapes at 
their ends. 

It drifted slowly until it hov- 
ered over the pile of boxes that 
the lizards had gathered. Then 
a hatch opened in its belly, and 
a hook emerged at the end of 
three cords. The lizards on the 
plaza began sliriging loops of cord 
from their boxes to the hook. 

Falk watched them idly. The 
hook began to rise, dragging the 
boxes after it, and at the last mo- 
ment one of the lizards tossed an- 
other loop over it. 

The new box was heavy; the 
hook stopped when it took up the 
slack, and the airboat dipped 
slightly. Then it rose again, and 
the hook rose, too, until the whole 
load was ten feet off the ground. 

Abruptly, one of the three cords 
snapped. Falk saw it whip 
through the air, saw the load 
lurch ponderously to one side, 
and the airboat dip. The pilot in- 
stantly sent the boat down, ts 
take up the strain on the remain- 
ing cords. 

The lizards were scattering. 
The load struck heavily and. a 
moment later, so did the airboat.

It bounced, skidded wildly and 
came to rest as the pilot shut off 
the power. 

The lizards crowded around 
again, and the two in the boat 
climbed down for an interminable 
conference. Eventually they got 
j aboard again. The boat rose a 
few feet while the lizards disen- 
gaged the hook. Then there was 
S'" another conference. Falk could 
I » see that the doors of the boat’s 
hatth were closed and had a 
crumpled look. Evidently they 
were jammed shut. 

The boat finally came down 
once more, and with much argu- 
ment and gesticulation the boxes 

TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



were unpacked and some of their 
contents reloaded into two new 
boxes, these being hoisted with 
much effort into the cockpit. The 
rest was left strewn around the 
plaza. 

The airboat lifted and went 
away, and most of the lizards fol- 
lowed it. One straggler came over 
for a last look at Falk. He peered 
and gestured through the wall 
for a while, then gave it up and 
followed the rest. The plaza was 
deserted. 

Some time passed before Falk 
saw a pillar of white flame that 
lifted, with a glint of silver at its 
tip, somewhere beyond the city; 

157 



and grew until it arched upward 
to the zenith, and dwindled, and 
vanished. 

So the lizards had spaceships. 
They did not dare use the Door- 
ways, either. Not fit . too much 
like men. 

■f^ALK went out into the plaza 
'*• and stood while the freshen- 
ing breeze ruffled his hair. The 
sun was dropping behind the 
mountains, and the whole sky 
had turned ruddy, like a great 
crimson cape streaming out of 
the west. Falk watched, reluctant 
to leave, until the colors faded 
through violet to gray, and the 
first stars came out. 

It was a good world. A man 
coJld stay here, probably, and 
live his life out in comfort and 
ease. No doubt there were exotic 
fruits to be had from those trees. 
Certainly there was water. The 
climate was good. Falk thought 
sardonically that there could be 
no dangerous wild beasts, or 
those twittering tourists would 
never have come here. 

If all a man wanted was a hid- 
ing place, there could be no bet- 
ter world than this. For a moment 
Falk was strongly tempted. He 
thought of the cold dead worlds 
he had seen, and wondered if he 
would ever find a place as fair 
as this again. Also, he knew now 
that if the Doorway builders still 
lived, they must long ago have 

lit 



drawn in their outposts. Perhaps 
they lived on only one planet, 
out of all the billions. Falk would 
almost surely die before he found 
it. 

He looked at the rubble the 
lizards had left in the middle of 
the plaza. One box was still filled, 
but burst open; that was the one 
that had caused all the trouble. 
Around it was a child’s litter 
of baubles — pretty glass toys, red, 
green, blue, yellow, white. 

A lizard, abandoned here by his 
fellows, would no doubt be happy 
enough in the end. 

With a sigh, Falk turned back 
to the building. The door opened 
before him, and he collected his 
belongings, fastened down his hel- 
met. strapped on his knapsack 
again. 

The sky was dark now. Falk 
paused to look up at the familiar 
sweep of the Milky Way. Then 
he switched on his helmet light 
and turned toward the waiting 
Doorway. 

As the light fell across the 
burst box the lizards had left, 
Falk saw a hard edge of some- 
thing thrusting out. It was not the 
glassy adamant of the Doorway 
builders; it looked like stone. 

Falk stopped and tore the box 
aside. 

He saw a slab of rock, roughly 
smoothed to the shape of a wedge. 
On its upper face characters were 
incised. They were in English. 



OALAVY' SCIE'NCE FlCtlON 



With blood pounding in his ears, 
Falk knelt by the stone and read 
what was written there. 

THE DOORWAYS STOP THE 
AGING PROCESS. I WAS 32 WHEN 
I LEFT MARS, AM HARDLY OLD- 
ER NOW, THOUGH I HAVE BEEN 
TRAVELING FROM STAR TO 
STAR FOR A TIME THAT I BE- 
LIEVE CANNOT BE LESS THAN 
20 YRS. BUT YOU MUST KEEP 
ON. I STOPPED HERE 2 YRS., 
FOUND MYSELF AGING. HAVE 
OBSERVED that MILKY WAY 
LOOKS NEARLY THE SAME 
FROM ALL PLANETS SO FAR VIS- 
ITED. THIS CANNOT BE COINCI- 
DENCE. BELIEVE DOORWAY 
TRAVEL IS RANDOM ONLY 
WITHIN CONCENTRIC BELTS OF 
STARS & THAT SOONER OR 
LATER YOU HIT DOORWAY 
WHICH GIVES ENTRY TO NEXT 
INNERMOST BELT. IF I AM 
RIGHT. FINAL DESTINATION IS 
CENTER OF GALAXY. I HOPE TO 
SEE YOU THERE. 

JAMES E. TANNER 

NATIVE of' EARTH 

Falk stood up, blinded by the 
glory of the vision that grew in 
his mind. He thought he under- 
stood now why the Doorways 
were not selective, and why their 
makers no longer used them. 

Once — a billion years ago, per- 
haps — they must have been un- 
contested owners of the Galaxy. 



But many of their worlds were 
small planets, like Mars, not large 
enough to keep their atmospheres 
and their water forever. Millions 
of years ago, they must have 
begun to fall back from these. 
And meanwhile, Falk thought, on 
the steaming worlds that now 
were cooling, the lesser breeds 
had arisen. The crawling, brawl- 
ing things. The lizards. The men. 
Creatures not worthy of the stars. 

So the way was made long, and 
the way was made hard; and the 
lesser breeds stayed on their plan- 
ets. But for a man, or a lizard, 
who would give up all that he 
called “life” for knowledge, the 
way was open. 

Falk turned off the beam of his 
head-lamp and looked up at the 
diamond mist of the Galaxy. 
Where would he be, a thousand 
years from today? Standing on 
that mote of light, or that? 

Not dust, at any rate. Not dust, 
unmourned, unworthy. He would 
be a voyager with a destination, 
and perhaps half his journey 
would be done. 

Wolfert would wait in vain for 
his return, but it would not mat- 
ter: he was happy, if you called 
his existence happiness. And on 
Earth, the mountains would rise 
and fall long after the question 
of human survival had been for- 
gotten. By that time, perhaps, 
Falk would be home.
