W/'ORLD WAR II was the 
most remarkable war in his- 
tory for two reasons : 

• Even military analysts real- 
ized instantly that rockets, jets 
and nuclear weapons had smash- 
ed the old rules of strategy. 

• They missed what may have 
been the most important innova- 
tion, which I’ll get back to in a 
minute. 

Some wars change the charac- 
ter of war, a fact that analysts 
usually miss until the next one, 
when they can trace back to the 
original causes. Von Moltke, for 
instance, dismissed the War Be- 
tween the States as two armed 
mobs chasing each other over the 
countryside, from which nothing 
was to be learned. Yet that war 
introduced armored ships, land 
mines and defense in depth, 
among other novelties. 

World War I adopted the de- 
fense in depth and froze it rigidly 
into war of position. Using its ac- 
tuarial tables, Capt. B. H. Lid- 
dell Hart predicted — before WW 
II — that such modern defenses as 
the Maginot Line had made mili- 
tary assault unthinkable. 

How could he have overlooked 
the importance of planes and 
tanks in breakthrough? In the 
same way his embarrassing an- 
alysis is being overlooked now, 



so that he remains an honored ex- 
pert. But he was guilty of nothing 
more than von Moltke — missing 
the revolutionary nature of the 
change simply because it was rev- 
olutionary and therefore unpre- 
dictable. 

Military analysts are having 
the same trouble with the wea- 
pons introduced in WW II. Un- 
like the waspish fighter planes, 
the slow bombers with their puny 
payloads and the lumbering blind 
tanks of WW I, these had no in- 
fancy to go through. 

Or did they? 

You and I can’t answer, nor 
can the analysts. But even if they 
could, they’d be unaware of the 
point I said I would return to. 

Science fiction became a mili- 
tary factor for the first time in 
history. 

In America, it was studied 
sharply for new ideas. I don’t 
know how many were combed 
out, or which ones, but certainly 
no reader was unfamiliar with 
them when they were put onstage. 

In England, the same process 
went on, plus another funnier 
one: Writers were invited to sub- 
mit their most fantastic notions, 
which were carefully blueprinted 
— and the nonsensical plans de- 
liberately allowed to fall into ene- 
my hands!

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And there, underscored with 
italics, is perhaps the great rev- 
olutionary fact of World War II. 
Not the bombs, which may be 
outlawed as was poison gas, or 
the rockets and jets, which can 
be countered, but the first mili- 
tary use of science fiction. 

Where will it lead to? That’s 
prediction and we’re not in that 
business. 

Where can it lead to? That’s 
extrapolation, which is our busi- 
ness. 

• Weapons, unquestionably — 
we’ve made a big contribution in 
this field and will go on doing so. 

• Tactics — when novel weapons 
are brought forth, novel thinking, 
imagination and daring are need- 
ed, and those are working defi- 
nitions of science fiction. 

• Strategy — here is where sci- 
ence fiction could have far more 
impact than in the thinking up 
and putting to use of weapons. 

As I’ve said before, our bombs 
are only bigger ballistae, our ra- 
dar merely electronic armor and 
shields. If it comes to a shooting 
war, God forbid, science fiction 
will continue dreaming up such 
devices. 

But its notions of psychologi- 
cal warfare and invasion might 
be more valuable. You’ve read 
many — most of them attributed 
to extraterrestrial invaders, but 
some quite applicable to us. The 
best ones, of course, succeed 



bloi'dlessly; we’re no admirers of 
slaughter and the messing up of 
real estate. All good generals 
agree with that, but they can’t 
break tradition without the in- 
genuity that science fiction can 
offer. 

As an example, sending spies 
and saboteurs into potential en- 
emy territory is old hat. So is the 
Roman principle of divide and 
rule — once you’ve started firing, 
it’s almost impossible to do any 
dividing. 

Instead, send in experts who 
can maddeningly hog the road, 
hold up queues while fishing for 
change or ration coupons, tie up 
buses by asking questions that 
need complicated answers, snarl 
phone service with endless bright, 
witless gabble, bring cops and 
firemen to rescue kittens caught 
in trees, immobilize banks by de- 
positing sacks of coins that have 
to be counted or by breaking big 
bills into infuriating combina- 
tions of smaller bills and change, 
holding up subway trains for 
friends . 

In other words, inflict our daily 
frustrations in exaggerated form 
on a potential enemy — and watch 
his society go edgy and begin to 
shake apart! 

Science fiction prefers peace, 
but it can fight with devilish in- 
ventiveness when necessary. 

And it’s started to do so!

granny 

When primly starched boy met unprim 
and unstarched girl, it was revolt at first 
sight, for Granny didn't knit— she wove! 




Illustrated by TONEY 



F OR ROAN, there was a 
flicker of blackness, almost 
too brief to notice, and he 
had arrived at his destination. He 
stepped down from the transplat 
and took three preoccupied steps 
before he realized, shockingly, 
that he had not materialized in 
the offices of J. & D. Walsh at 
all, but in a small plat-court 
hung with heavy and barbarous 



drapes. There was a fresh and 
disturbing odor in the air, which 
was too warm. 

He cast about him worriedly, 
hunting for the dialpost that 
would send him to his father’s 
office. It was not where it should 
be, at the corner of the court. 
Petals! He was late and lateness 
meant trouble. 

“Well-1-1?” drawled a half

singing, half whispering voice. 

Roan spun, hitting the side of 
his foot painfully on the corner 
of the transplat. It made him 
hop. He had never felt so ex- 
cruciatingly foolish in his entire 
thirty years. 

“I’m sorry,” he spluttered. “I 
must have dialed the wrong num- 
ber.” He located the source of 
the voice — a door across from 
him was open at its top panel 
and, in the small space, was fram- 
ed a face . 

The face! 

If you dream about faces, you 
dream about them after you meet 
them, not before! The thought 
blazed at him, made him blink, 
and he blinked again at the cloud 
of golden hair and the laughing 
green eyes. 

. the wrong, you see,” he 
concluded lamely, “number.” 

“Maybe it was and maybe it 
wasn’t,” she said, in tones which 
could have been scored on a 
musical staff. Her hand appeared, 
to press back the side of the 
golden cloud. 

A bare hand. 

rriINGLING with shock at such 
wanton exposure, he looked 
away quickly. “I’ll have to — uh 
— may I use your transplat?” 

“It’s better than walking,” she 
said and smiled. "It’s over there.” 
A long bare arm appeared, carry- 
ing a pointing finger. The arm 



was retracted and there was a 
small fumbling at the door-latch. 
“I’ll show you.” 

"No!” How could this creature 
forget that — that she wasn’t de- 
cently covered? “I’ll find it.” He 
floundered against the drapes, 
fumbled along them, at last threw 
one away from the dial pedestal. 
With his back firmly toward her, 
he said, “I have no tokens with 
me.” 

"Do you have to go?” 

"Yes!” 

She laughed. “Well, either way, 
be my guest.” 

"Thanks,” he managed. "I’ll — 
uh — send — ” he began to dial 
busily and carefully, to avoid an- 
other wrong number — “send it to 
when I as soon as good of you 
three five.” 

Averting his eyes, he stood on 
the transplat. She was still inside 
her cubicle, thank the powers. 
Then he remembered that he 
hadn’t the slightest idea of the 
number he had mistakenly dial- 
ed; although it had stared him 
in the face on her dialpost, he 
had been too distraught to read it. 

"Oh, I didn’t get your num- 
ber!” he said hoarsely, but the 
familiar flicker of total blackness 
had come and gone, and he was 
standing on the transplat inside 
the office of J. & D. Walsh, wav- 
ing his hand stupidly at Corson- 
may, the oldish receptionist with 
the youngish hair.

"My number?” Corsonmay 
echoed. Appallingly, she giggled. 
“Why, Roan Walsh, I never!” 
Under the privacy hood, her 
hands flickered. As he passed her 
desk, she pressed upon him a 
slip of paper. “It’s really a very 
easy one to remember,” she sim- 
pered. 

He wordlessly stepped to his 
door. It slid back. He entered 
and, while it was closing behind 
him hurled the paper violently at 
the disposal slot. "Blossom!” he 
cursed and slumped into his 
chair. 

“Roan, step in here a mo- 
ment!” snarled the grille above 
him. 

“Yes, Private!” Roan gasped 
out. 

He sat for a moment, drawing 
deep breaths as if the extra oxy- 
gen would somehow give him the 
right words to say. Then he rose 
and approached a side panel, 
which slid open for him. His 
father sat glowering at him. His 
father was dressed exactly as he 
was, exactly as Hallmay and 
Corsonmay and Walshmam and 
everyone else in the world was, 
except — but don’t think about 
her now, whatever happens! 

T>RIVATE Walsh swung his 
•*- glower, beard and all, across 
Roan, then slipped his gloved 
hands under the privacy hood 
and studied them thoughtfully. 



Though Roan could not see them, 
he knew they were held with the 
fingers decently together, as un- 
like living things as possible. 

“I am not pleased,” said 
Private Walsh. 

What now? Roan wondered 
hopelessly. 

“There is more to a business 
than making profits,” said the 
bearded man. “There is more to 
this business than moving goods. 
It is not a large business, but an 
arch’s key is not necessarily a 
large stone. The transportation 
platform — ” he droned, using the 
device’s formal name as if the 
service wore a mitred hat — “is 
the keystone of our entire culture, 
and this firm is the keystone of 
the transplat industry. Our re- 
sponsibilities are great. Your 
responsibilities are great. A posi- 
tion such as yours requires cer- 
tain intangibles over and above 
your ability to make out mani- 
fests. Integrity, boy, reliability — 
respect for privacy. And, above 
all, personal honor and decency.” 

Roan, having heard this many 
times before, wrenched his fea- 
tures into an expression of peni- 
tence. 

“One of the first indications of 
a gentleman — and to be a good 
businessman, one must be a good 
man, and the best of good men 
is a gentleman— one of the first 
ways of detecting the presence of 
a gentleman in our midst, I say, 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT

is to ask oneself this question: 
‘Is he punctual?’ ” Private Walsh 
leaned so far forward that his 
beard audibly brushed the priv- 
acy hood. The sound made 
Roan’s flesh creep. “You were 
late this morning!” 

Roan had a hysterical impulse 
to blurt, “Well, you see, I stopped 
off at a girl’s place on the way 
and had a chat with her while 
she waved her bare arm . .” 
But even hysteria yielded to his 
conditioning. And then his mind 
began to work again. 

“Private,” he said sorrowfully, 
“I was late. I can explain — ” he 
heard the intake of breath and 
raised his voice slightly — “but 
I cannot excuse and will not try.” 
The breath slid out again. Roan 
stepped backward one step. 
“With your permission, then, 
Byepry.” 

“Bye nothing. What is this ex- 
planation?” 

rpHIS had better be good, 
Roan told himself. He put his 
hand behind him. He knew this, 
with face downcast, added to his 
penitent appearance. 

“I awoke this morning caught 
up with a great idea,” he said. “I 
think I have found an economy.” 
“If you have,” rumbled the 
beard, “it’s been hiding from me.” 
“Each load of freight we 
transplat carries a man with it. 
This man does nothing but hold 



the manifest in his hand and 
look up the receiver’s clerk at the 
arrival point. My plan is to elimi- 
nate that man.” 

“You awoke with this in 
mind?” 

“Yes, Private,” Roan lied, still 
marveling at his mental resource- 
fulness. 

“And thinking about it delayed 
you?” 

“Yes, Private.” 

“Since you were apparently 
fated to be late in any case,” the 
old man said acidly, “you’d have 
done better to stay asleep. You 
would have wasted less of your 
time — and mine.” 

Roan knew enough to keep his 
mouth shut. 

“In the history of matter trans- 
mission,” said his father, “nine 
shipments have gone astray. The 
consequences are appalling. I 
shall assign you to read the his- 
tory of these nine cases and mem- 
orize the figures. In one such 
case — the arrival of one hundred 
and twelve cubic meters of pig- 
iron in a private house measur- 
ing eighty-four meters — the 
results were spectacularly expen- 
sive.” 

“But that can’t happen now!” 

“No, it can’t,” admitted Private 
Walsh. “Not since the capacity- 
lock, which prevents the ship- 
ment of any volume to a smaller 
one. But there is still room for 
some gruesome possibilities, as 



10

in the Fathers of Leander case, 
when two hundred female as- 
sembly workers were sent, in 
error, into the monastery of this 
silent order. The damages — first 
degree violation of privacy, you 
know — were quadrupled for the 
particular aggravation and mul- 
tiplied by the number of Fathers 
and novitiates. Eight hundred 
and fourteen, if I remember cor- 
rectly, and I do. 

“Now, the employment of a 
properly trained operator would 
have reduced the presence of 
these females in that building to 
a matter of tenths of a second 
and the damages accordingly. 
The shipment would have been 
returned to its source almost be- 
fore it had arrived. As long as 
such things can occur, the wages 
paid these operators are cheap in- 
surance indeed.” He paused iron- 
ically. “Is there anything else 
you want to suggest?” 

“If you please, Private,” Roan 
said formally, “I am acquainted 
with these matters. My sugges- 
tion was this — that phone contact 
be made with the receiving party 
when the shipment is ready — that 
our bonded transplat operator 
dial seven of the eight digits 
necessary — and that the final im- 
pulse be activated at the receiv- 
ing point by audio or video, or 
even by a separate beamed radio, 
which we could supply to our 
regular customers or deliver by 

GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



messenger a few minutes before 
the main shipment.” 

TT got very quiet in the office. 

“You see,” said Roan, press- 
ing his advantage, “if the final 
shipping orders come from the 
receiver himself, it is difficult to 
imagine how anyone else could 
possibly receive the load.” 

This silence was longer, and 
was ended by a sound from the 
beard precisely as if the old man 
had bitten into an olive pit. “You 
mentioned a messenger for the 
impulse-device. Where’s your 
saving?” 

“Most of our trade is with 
regular customers. Each of these 
could be given his own machine.” 

Silence. 

Roan all but whispered, “An 
exclusive service of J. 8c D. 
Walsh.” 

“Well!” said Private Walsh. It 
was the most unreadable syllable 
Roan had ever heard. “This is 
not a suggestion, nor the conse- 
quence of anything specific which 
may or may not have happened; 
it is purely a request for a private 
opinion. Which strikes you as 
more — shall we say euphonious — 
J. & D. Walsh 8e Son, or J., D. 
86 R. Walsh?” 

Roan felt one of his fingernails 
bite through his glove as he 
clasped his hands behind him. He 
hoped his voice would not shake 
when he answered. “I could not 

11 



presume to express an opinion on 
such a matter to one as familiar 
with . .” and, beyond that, his 
voice would not go. 

He flashed a glance at his 
father, and almost extraneously it 
occurred to him that if the old 
man ever smiled, he might not be 
able to see it at all through the 
beard. Chalk yet one more ad- 
vantage up to the enviable state 
of being head of a family. 

He thought for a moment that 
his father was about to say some- 
thing pleasant, but the impos- 
sibility remained impossible, and 
the old man merely nodded at the 
door. “You’re expected at my 
Mam’s this evening,” he said 
curtly. “Be prompt there, at 
least.” 

It stung, and the old man fol- 
lowed it up. “Lying abed im- 
mersed in company problems, 
even if they are of doubtful value, 
speaks well of an employee’s de- 
votion to his work. Unpunctuality 
speaks badly of it. A Private — ” 
he squared his shoulders — “can 
be on time and be inspired.” 

Roan lowered his chin another 
notch and shuffled backward to 
the panel. It opened. He went 
through. When the panel clicked 
home, Roan leaped straight up in 
the air, his whole being filled with 
a silent shout. The partnership! 
He's going to shake loose that 
gorgeous, beautiful, blossomy old 
partnership! His gloved hands 



pounded silently and gleefully to- 
gether. Oh, Roan, you dog you, 
how do you do it? What makes 
that fuzzy head of yours tick 
when you get in a jam? Oh, 
you’re a — 

He stopped, his mouth slack 
and his eyes abulge. There on his 
desk, in precisely the same pose, 
sat the golden-haired vision he 
had seen during the night and 
whose number he had dialed by 
error in the morning. 

QHE was dressed — if one could 
^ call it dressed — in a long gar- 
ment which fell from her throat 
and cascaded softly around her, 
rolling and folding and complete- 
ly unlike the wrinkle-free, met- 
rical cone-thrust-in-a-cone of 
conventional garb. Her arms 
were entirely bare and so, in- 
credibly, were the feet which 
peeped out from under the flow- 
ing hem. She sat with both hands 
crossed on one knee and regarded 
him gravely. She smiled and was 
for a second transparent — and 
then she vanished. 

Roan saw people and huge car- 
goes vanish every day — but not 
sixty meters from the nearest 
transplat! And not people inde- 
cently clad in outlandish fabrics 
which fell close to the body in- 
stead of standing properly away 
from it! 

There was a heat in his face, 
and he became aware that he had 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



not breathed in — how long? There 
was a straining ache about him 
and he realized that, at some 
point in this extraordinary ex- 
perience, he had slumped to his 
knees on the carpet. 

He got shakily to his feet and 
let himself be preoccupied with 
the reflex of adjusting his pan- 
talets. They were neat and glossy 
and perfectly cylindrical, and not 
at all like the delicate pink taper 
of her — her limb. She’d had toes, 
too. Had it ever occurred to him 
before to wonder if women had 
toes? Surely not! Yet they had. 
She had. 

Then reaction struck him and 
he staggered to his desk. 

His first lucid thought was to 
wonder what this vision would 
look like properly clad and he 
found that he could not possibly 
imagine it. He found, further, 
that he did not want to imagine 
it, and he descended into a scald- 
ing shame at the discovery. Oh, 
cried every ounce of upbringing 
within him, the Private was right 
in withholding the partnership 
for so long; he’d be so wrong in 
trusting me with it! What am I, 
he sobbed silently, what horrible 
thing am I?

that the supply of chromium-plated

mass for transplat shipment to you, 
which must total two toes. However, 
knowing that you use prefab paneling

you. We have the material in white,

words which glowed on the

his telefax. He was wondering 
mistily whether that line about 
radiator grilles was quite right 
when the annunciator hummed. 
“Yes?” 

Corsonmay’s giggly voice then 
emerged. “Greenbaum Grofast 
just called, Roan Walsh. Query 
on a ’fax transmitted at 1013 
from your matrix. They want to 
know what is meant by item 
eleven on it.” 

“What’s item eleven?” 

“It says here, ‘smiling toe- 
nails.’ ” 

“Whatever it means, it’s wrong. 
Is there a price on the item?” 
“Just a blank.” 

“Then it doesn’t matter. Tell 
them to cancel the line and up- 
number the other items. You 
could have thought of that.”

“I'm sawrrree,” she said in 
such a disgustingly ingratiating 
tone that, had she been in the 
room with him, he would certain- 
ly have bashed her head clear 
down to her bedroom — no, back- 
bone. 

“Listen,” he snapped, “lift the 
copy of every 'fax I’ve sent out 
since I got here this morning and 
bring them in.” 

Roan growled. The shot of 
adrenalin his irritation yielded up 
cleared his mind and his vision, 
and he stared appalled at the 
letter on his screen. Shuddering, 
he cleared it. He could just see 
old Quinn puzzling out “if this is 
marriageable to you.” Further, 
he could see the deep, secret rip- 
plings at the base of his father’s 
beard if by any chance Quinn 
happened to check through to 
him. 

Corsonmay minced in with a 
sheaf of copies. “This one says — ” 

“Give me those. Byemay,” he 
rapped. 

“Well, bye.” At the panel, she 
stopped and said solicitously, 
“Roan Walsh, you look — I mean 
is there anything . .” 

“Bye may!” he roared. 

She gulped. “You could tell 
me.” Then her eyes widened as 
she watched his face. That odd, 
detached part of himself which 
irrepressibly wondered about such 
things wondered now just what 
expression he was wearing. What- 



ever it was, it blew her out of 
the office as if the room were a 
cannon and she the shell. 

He looked at the top sheet. 
*. your question as to how 
many support poles in a lading 
ton. The clerk in charge will sup- 
ply the information. What is her 
number anyway?' Then there was 
another reference to gold, this 
time with the light behind it, and 
a fantastic paragraph about ship- 
ping a generator complete with 
ankling bolts. 

Going through the sheets, the 
most recent first, he was relieved 
to see that his preoccupation had 
noticeably affected only the last 
four messages. He settled himself 
down to a grim and careful enun- 
ciation of the corrections, worded 
with apologies but without ex- 
planations, checked them care- 
fully and sent them. Then he 
destroyed the copies he had cor- 
rected. 

■W7HEN he straightened up, his 
** face was flushed and his 
head spun. Noon already. Thank 
the powers for that. 

Then he saw the note on his 
desk, at the corner on which the 
vision had appeared. In beauti- 
fully firm calligraphy was a 
transplat number — nothing more. 

Hussy ! 

But he put it in his pocket. 

On the way out, he said to 
Corsonmay, without looking at 



14 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



her, “Won’t be back today. Field 
work.” 

“Oh, but you’re not scheduled 
for — ” 

Before she could finish, he 
whirled and glared at her. She 
gulped so hard, he had the mad 
conviction that she was about to 
swallow her own lips. He strode 
to the dialpost, spun a number 
and got out of there. 

He stood for a moment under 
the sky — well, under the metal- 
glas canopy — drinking in the 
sights of Grosvenor Center. There 
were shops and a restaurant and 
a library, and a theater as well, 
an immense structure honey- 
combed from top to bottom with 
its one-seat cells and one-man 
screens. Something called The 
Glory of Stasis was playing. He 
remembered the reviews — a two- 
hour prose poem dedicated to 
the fantasy of eternal afternoons, 
permanent roses and everlasting 
youthfulness. He should see it, 
he thought. After all, wasn’t that 
what he needed — a reaffirmation 
in the permanence of things and 
his place in this eternal society? 

How comforting the Center 
was! People moved from one 
shop to another, not hurrying, 
not idling, each as sure of where 
he was going as where he had 
come from. Each dressed alike, 
walked alike, the rectangular feet 
unhesitating, the tubular limbs 
alternating, the cone - in - cone 

GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



clothing never rippling, never 
draping, never clinging close to 
bodies . 

He shook himself. 

. And concealed under the 
decent capes, stockinged hands 
were folded, unused until needed 
— just as Godmade as a bird’s 
wing — and hidden when they 
worked, as all working mechan- 
isms were housed. And as far as 
the eye could see them, these sane 
folk were identifiable, correct. 
One was never in doubt, for that 
smooth-faced one was a Bachelor 
like himself, and the long hair 
yonder was a May, and the bound 
hair a Mam, and the bearded 
ones were Privates. 

Noble title, Private — constant 
reminder of the great principle 
of Privacy, which was the very 
essence of all order. It was born, 
he had been taught, of the people 
themselves when, in the days of 
the barbarities, they had formed 
great armies — millions upon mil- 
lions of just people in a single or- 
ganization — and their majority 
were called Private. Magnificent 
then and magnificent today. 

TTE saw the bank of transplats 
and felt a surge of pride. 
Someone had used the term “key- 
stone.” A good one. For the trans- 
plat covered the Earth like a 
great clean cape, standardizing 
language, dress, customs and am- 
bitions. Every spot on Earth 

15 



was but a step and a split-second 
away from every other, and all 
resources lay ready for the seek- 
ing glove. He had been curious 
enough, at one time, to attempt 
an orientation in geographic dis- 
tances. He soon gave it up as 
profitless. What did it matter 
that the company offices were 
in Old New Mexico and his home 
near what had once been called 
Philadelphia? Could it be im- 
portant that Corsonmay arrived 
each morning from Deutsch Pol- 
ska and Hallmay, the Private’s 
secretary, slept each night in 
Karachi? 

The population was stabilized 
below its resources. Why, there 
was enough copper to supply 
power fuel for seven centuries — 
copper which, so they said, was 
once used to carry feeble little 
pulses of electricity. And when 
the copper was gone, it would be 
simple enough to synthesize more. 
Food — filthy, necessary, secret 
stuff — was no longer a problem. 
And for delicacies of mind and 
heart, there were the spaceships, 
roaring away to the stars and re- 
turning years later, carrying 
strange fossils and odd stones, 
after having traveled every labor- 
ious inch out and every inch back 
again, aging their crews and en- 
riching the world. 

Once, he knew, there had been 
talk of an interplanetary trans- 
plat, but it was now unshakably 



established that the effect was 
possible only in a gravitic field of 
planetary “viscosity.” Once the 
immense task of establishing the 
dial central was finished, the sys- 
tem could be extended anywhere 
on a planet, but never between 
them. And a good thing, too, as 
his father had explained to him. 
What would happen to the beau- 
tifully balanced cultural structure 
if humanity were suddenly free 
to scatter through the Universe 
as it now scattered over the 
Earth? And why leave? What 
could there possibly be for any- 
one — except a crazy spaceman — 
off Earth? 

He had read this, too : A specie s 
which can build perfection as 
fast as we have done is a species 
capable of maintaining perfec- 
tion forever. It took fifteen thou- 
sand years to populate the Earth 
and then explode it in a mighty 
war. It took half a thousand years 
to concentrate the few hundred 
thousand survivors in Africa, 
the only continent left in which 
men could live. It took the Afri- 
can Colony six hundred years to 
reach the transplat stage in its 
technology. But that was only a 
hundred and fifty years back. The 
transplat built cities in days, 
floated them on impervious bed- 
plates and shielded them with 
radiation-proof domes when nec- 
essary. People could settle any- 
where — and they did. People 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could work the Earth for its re- 
sources almost anywhere — and 
they did. 

¥> OAN sighed, feeling much 
better. He looked away from 
the calm but busy Center and 
idly took in what could be seen 
of the horizon. There a snow- 
capped mountain hung like a 
cloud, and yonder was blue water 
as far as the eye could see. He 
wondered what mountain it might 
be, what sea; and then he laugh- 
ed. It was all the same to a 
man, all the same to humanity. 

He paced out the Center, from 
one end to the other, delighted, 
-proud. He was young and vital 
and marriageable — perhaps all 
such as he suffered from the 
equivalent of his blonde appari- 
tion when that time of life came 
upon them. Marriage, after all, 
held certain animal mysteries, 
and like those of his flower-shop, 
where he cleaned his body and 
teeth and stoked himself with 
food concentrates, they just could 
not be discussed. He would wait 
and see; when the time came, 
the mysteries would be explained, 
even as had all the others. 

He came out into the walkway 
loving everybody, even, for a mo- 
ment, Granny. 

Granny! He stopped and closed 
his eyes, his face twisted. He’d 
very nearly forgotten about her. 
Well, she could blossom well 



wait. He’d had a bad time this 
morning and the very thought of 
Granny then had been unbear- 
able. Who, in the throes of self- 
abasement, wanted contact with 
a veritable monolith of respect- 
ability? And who, having re- 
gained his respectability, needed 
the monolith? Either way, the 
visit was insupportable. He’d 
make his sister Valerie go. Some- 
one from the family had to make 
the visit once a week. Why, he 
didn’t know and had never asked. 
Let Valerie do it. What was the 
use of having a sister if you 
couldn’t get her to do the dirty 
work once in a while? 

He crossed the walkway, went 
to the phone banks .and dialed 
Valerie’s number after a glance 
at his watch. She should be back 
at work from noonrest £y now. 

She was. As soon as she saw 
his face, she said, “Roan Walsh, 
if you’re calling up to palm that 
visit to Granny off on me, you 
have another think coming. I do 
my duty by the family and I’m 
blessed if I can see why I should 
do any more than my duty or 
why you should do any less so 
don’t even say a word about it.” 
He opened his mouth, but before 
anything came out of it, she said, 
“And don’t be late either. And 
especially, don’t be early.” 

Roan opened his mouth again, 
but the screen went black. 

Out in the filtered sunlight

again, he let the chagrin fade 
and the amusement grow. It grew 
into something rare in Roan — an 
increasing glow of heady resent- 
ment and conscious command. 
How did these magnificent hu- 
man beings get so magnificent in 
the first place? Why, by asking if 
everything was all right or if it 
weren’t — and, if it weren’t, then 
they changed things until it was. 
Now everything was all right 
with him, except this Granny 
business. They ask the question — 
why should he go see Granny? 
Because someone always had to. 
That was no answer. Put it an- 
other way, then — what would 
happen if he just didn’t go? 

TTE strode buoyantly down the 
walkway, beaming fiercely at 
the pass’ersby, and the wonderful 
thought defeated him in exactly 
seven minutes, twenty seconds. 
Because the answer to ‘What if he 
just didn’t go?’ was: 

From Mam, that hurt look and 
then an avalanche of “under- 
standing.” 

From Val, a silent, holier-than- 
thou waspishness, day after day. 

And from the Private, thunder 
and lightning. And no partner- 
ship. Well, buds with the part- 
nership! 

At this point, he stopped walk- 
ing. What did you do when you 
walked out on your family’s busi- 
ness? 



He’d never known anyone who 
had. Where did you go? What 
did you do? 

His other, inner self said, ban- 
teringly, Aw, come off it. Are you 
going to kick over the Cosmos to 
save yourself sixty minutes with 
the old woman? 

Roan said nothing to that. So 
the voice added, What have you 
got against Granny, anyway? 

“She bothers me,” Roan said 
aloud. He turned and went into a 
decorator. 

What for? demanded the inner 
Roan. 

“To buy something for Gran- 
ny,” he replied. And the inner 
voice, damn' its stinking stamens, 
chuckled and said, Know what, 
Roan? You're a crawling coward. 

“Why can’t you be on my side 
for once?” he demanded, but its 
only answer was a snigger so 
smug that even his sister Valerie 
might have envied it. 

The decorator was an old 
bachelor with a fierce counte- 
nance. Roan bought roses and 
hybrid jonquils, paid for them 
and started out. Suddenly he 
went back, prodded by his weird 
questioning mood, and said, 
“What did they call a place where 
you buy roses before they called 
it a decorator?” 

The man uttered a soprano 
nickering which. Roan deduced, 
was laughter. He leaned across 
the counter and, looking over 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



each of his shoulders in turn, said 
in a shrill whisper, “Flower shop.” 
He clung to the counter and 
twisted up his face until the 
tears spurted. 

Roan waited patiently until the 
man calmed down and then ask- 
ed, “Well, then, why do they call 
the you-know-what a flower 
shop?” 

This seemed to sober the man. 
He scratched his pale, cropped 
head. “I don’t know. I guess be- 
cause, whatever they called it be- 
fore, people used to make jokes 
and cuss-words about it. Like 
now with — with Flower Shops.” 

Roan shuddered. Its motiva- 
tion was beyond definition for 
him, but with it came a feeling of 
having taken a ludicrous path to 
a great truth, and somehow he 
knew he would never joke or 
swear about flower shops again. 
Or, for that matter, about what- 
ever new name they gave the 
plumbing after they got through 
with muddying up this one. For 
this much he could say aloud, 
“There ought to be something 
else to curse and make jokes 
about.” 

TT'HE man’s fierce face yielded 
for a moment to puzzlement, 
and then he shrugged. To Roan, 
it was a disgusting gesture and 
an alarming one, the one his 
father had made years ago, when 
Roan’s tongue was a little more 

GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



firmly attached to his curiosity 
than it had been of late. It was 
transplat this and transplat that, 
until he had suddenly asked his 
father how the thing worked. 
The Private had stopped dead, 
hesitated, then shrugged just that 
way. It was a gesture which said, 
“That’s how thing are, that’s all.” 

On the way to the transplats, 
Roan stopped where people clus- 
tered. There was a shop there 
dealing in, according to its sign, 
fad and fashion. Having passed 
through a number of engrossing 
fads in his life — Whirlstick and 
Chase and Warp and, once, a 
little hand loom on which he had 
woven a completely useless strip 
of material twice his length and 
two fingers wide — he stopped to 
see what people were buying. 

It was a motion-picture of 
white-gloved hands manipulating 
two thick needles and a sort of 
soft heavy thread. No one would 
have dared to do such a thing in 
the open, but the picture was ac- 
ceptable, though giggle-making. 

On a shelf at waist height were 
many samples of the fabric which 
seemed to be the product of this 
exercise. He stepped forward un- 
til his cape covered enough of 
the shelf for him to pick up a 
piece of the material. 

It was loosely woven, with a 
paradoxical texture, very rough, 
yet very soft. 

It fell on and around his hand 

19 



and draped away like — like . 

“What is it? What’s this call- 
ed?” he blurted. 

A woman next to him said, 
“They call it knitting.” 

Ill 

TJE skipped to the laFarge 
yards and Kimberley, Dan- 
bury Marble and Krasniak, 
checking inventories and con- 
sulting accountants. He did it 
all without notes, which he had 
left in his office when he charged 
out at noon. He did it efficiently 
and he did it, without at first 
knowing why or even how, in 
the most superb cross-spoor fash- 
ion, so that, by quitting time, it 
would take far more trouble than 
it was worth for the office to dis- 
cover he had used the first two 
hours of the afternoon for his 
own purposes. 

This small dishonesty troubled 
him more than a little. Honor 
was part of the decency-privacy- 
perfection complex, and yet, to a 
degree, it seemed to be on the 
side of good business and high 
efficiency to operate without it. 
Did this mean that he was not 
and could not be what his father 
called a gentleman? If not, how 
much did it matter? 

He decided it didn’t matter, 
cursed silently and jovially at the 
inner voice which sneered at him, 
and went to see his grandmother. 



There was very little difference 
between one transplat court and 
another. A business might have a 
receptionist and homes might 
have a larger or smaller facility, 
but with the notable exception of 
the blonde’s apartment in his 
dream — surely it was a dream — 
when he first found walls covered 
with drapes, he had never noticed 
much difference between courts. 

Granny’s, however, always gave 
him a special feeling of awe. If 
it could be found anywhere on 
Earth, here, right here in this 
court, was the sum and symbol 
of their entire culture — neat, 
decent, correct. 

He stepped off the transplat 
and went to the dialpost to check 
the time, and was pleased. He 
could hardly have been any more 
punctual. 

There was a soft sound and a 
panel stood open. It was the same 
one as always and he wondered, 
as he had many times before, 
about the other rooms in Gran- 
ny’s house. He would not have 
been surprised if they all proved 
to be empty. What could she need 
but her rectitude, her solitude 
and a single room? 

He entered and stood reverent- 
ly. Granny, all ivory and white 
wax, made a slight motion with 
her hooded eyes and he sat op- 
posite her. Between them was a 
low, bare table. 

“Great Mam,” he said formal- 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ly, “good Stasis to you." 

“Hi,” she said quaintly. “How 
you doing, boy?" For all his pa- 
tient irritation with Granny, as 
always he felt the charm of her 
precise, archaic speech. Her voice 
was loud enough, clear enough, 
but always had the quality of a 
distant wind. “You look like you 
hoed a hard row." 

OAN understood, but only 
because of many years of ex- 
perience to her odd phrasing. “It’s 
not too bad. Business.” 

“Tell me about it." The old 
woman lived in some hazy, silent 
world of her own, separated in- 
calculably in time and space 
from the here and now, and yet 
she never failed to ask this ques- 
tion. 

He said, “Just the usual . 
I’ve brought you something.” 
From the pocket under his cape, 
he took the decorations he had 
bought, twisted the tube which 
confined them and handed the 
explosion of roses and daffodils 
to her. The other package clat- 
tered to the table. 

There was the demure flash 
of a snowy glove and she had 
the stems. She put her face down 
into the fragrant mass and he 
heard her breath whisper. “That 
was very kind,” she said. “And 
what’s this?” She popped the 
wrapping and peeped down be- 
tween the edge of the table and 

GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



the hem of her cape to see. 
“ Knitting ! I didn’t know anyone 
remembered knitting. Used to be 
just the thing for the old folk, 
when I was a sprout like you. 
Sit in the Sun and rock and knit, 
waiting for the end.” 

“I thought you’d like it.” He 
caught the slight movement of 
her shoulders and heard the snap 
of the wrappings as she closed the 
package again and slid it to the 
undershelf. 

They beamed at each other 
and she asked him, “Aren’t you 
working too hard? You look — 
well, you were going to tell me 
about the, business.” 

He said, “It’s about the same. 
Oh, I had an idea this morning 
and told the Private about it. I 
think he’s going to use it. He was 
pleased. He talked about the 
partnership.” 

“That’s fine, boy. What was 
the idea?” 

She wouldn’t understand. But 
he told her anyway, choosing his 
words carefully, about his plan to 
eliminate the transplat operators. 
She nodded gravely as he spoke, 
and at one point he had a mad 
impulse to start making up non- 
sense technological terms out of 
his head, just to see if she’d keep 
nodding. She would; it was all 
the same to her. She was just be- 
ing polite. 

He restrained himself and con- 
cluded, “So, if it works out, it 

21 



will be a real economy. There 
just wouldn’t be any way for a 
shipment to go astray the way — ” 
he almost blurted out the story 
of the arrival of the passenger 
van at the monastery, and caught 
himself just in time; the old lady 
would have been shocked to death 
— “the way some have in the 
past.” 

“I reckon they couldn’t,” she 
agreed, nodding as if she under- 
stood. 

TTE ought to return her cour- 
-■■■■- tesy, he thought, and said, 
“And what has occupied you, 
Great Mam?” 

“I do wish you’d keep calling 
me Granny,” she said, a shade of 
petulance creeping into the weary 
whisper. “What have I been do- 
ing? What might I be doing at 
my age? Know how old I am, 
Roan?” 

He nodded. 

“A hundred and eighty-three 
come spring,” she said, ignoring 
him. “I’ve seen a lot in my time. 
The stories I could tell you . 
Did you know I was born in the 
Africa Colony?” 

He nodded again, and again she 
ignored him. “Yes indeedy, I was 
about your age when all this 
started, when the transplat broke 
the bubble we lived in and scat- 
tered us all over the world.” 

Yes, you saw it happen! he 
thought, for the first time fully 



realizing something he had mere- 
ly knew statistically before. You 
saw folk dancing chest to chest 
and having food together and no 
one thinking a thing about it. 
You knew the culture before 
there was any real privacy or 
decency — you, who are the most 
private and decent of people to- 
day. The stories you could tell? 
Oh, yes — couldn’t you, though! 
What did they call them before 
they called them ‘ flower shops'? 

Certain she couldn’t conceiv- 
ably divine his motivations, he 
asked, “What did people do then, 
Granny? I mean — today, if you 
could name one single job all of 
us had to do, it would be keeping 
the perfection we have. Could 
you say that you folks had any 
one thing like that?” 

Her eyes lighted. Granny had 
the brightest eyes and the whit- 
est, soundest teeth of anyone he 
knew. “Sure we had.” She closed 
her eyes. “Can’t say we thought 
much about perfection — not in 
the early days. I think the main 
job was the next step up. The 
next step up,” she repeated, sav- 
oring the phrase. “You know, 
Roan, what we have today — well, 
we’re the first people in human 
history that wasn’t working on 
that, one way or another. They’d 
ought to teach human history 
nowadays. Yes, they should. But 
I guess most folks wouldn’t like 
it. Anyway, folks always wanted 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to be a bit better in those days. 

“Sometimes they stopped dead 
a couple hundred years and tried 
to make their souls better, and 
sometimes they forgot all about 
their souls and went ahead gettin’ 
bigger and faster and tougher and 
noisier. Sometimes they were real 
wrong and sometimes they did 
right just by accident; but all the 
time they worked and worked on 
that next step up. Not now,” she 
finished abruptly. 

“Of course not. What would 
we do with a step up? What 
would we step up to?” 

S HE said, “Used to be when no- 
body believed you could stop 
progress. A grass seed can bust 
a piece of granite half in two, 
you know. So can a cup o’ water 
if you freeze it in the right place.” 
“We’re different,” he said 
smugly. “Maybe that’s the real 
difference between us and other 
kinds of life. We can stop.” 

“You can say that again.” He 
did not understand her inflection. 
Before he could wonder about it, 
she said, “What do you know 
about psi, Roan?” 

“Psi?” He had to search his 
mind. “Oh — I remember it. Fad 
and Fashion was selling it a 
couple of years ago. I thought it 
was pretty silly.” 

“That!” she said, with as much 
scorn as her fragile, distant-wind 
voice could carry. “That was a 



weejee-board. That thing’s old- 
er’n anyone knows about. It 
didn’t deserve the name of psi. 
Well, look here — for ten thousand 
years, there’ve been folks who 
believed that there was a whole 
world of powers of the mind — 
telepathy, telekinesis, teleporta- 
tion, clairvoyance, clairaudience 
. lots more. Never mind, I’m 
not going to give you a lecture,” 
she said, her eyes suddenly spark- 
ling. 

He realized that he had essayed 
a yawn — just a small one — with 
his mouth closed, and that she 
had caught him at it. He flushed 
hotly. But she went right on. 

“All I’m saying is this — there’s 
plenty of proof of this power if 
you know where to look. One 
mind talks to another, a person 
moves in a blink from place to 
place without a transplat, a mind 
moves material things, someone 
knows in advance what’s going to 
happen — all this by mind power. 
Been going on for thousands of 
years. All that time, nobody un- 
derstood it — and now nobody 
needs to. But it’s still around.” 

He wondered what all this had 
to do with the subject at hand. 
As if she had heard him wonder, 
she said, “Now you wanted to 
know what the next step up might 
be, in case anybody was inter- 
ested. Well, that’s it.” 

“I can’t' see that as a step up- 
ward,” he said, respectfully but

positively. “We already do move 
things — speak over distances — all 
those things you mentioned. We 
even know what's going to hap- 
pen next. Everything is arranged 
that way. What good would it 
be?” 

"What good would it be to 
move the operators off the trans- 
plats?” 

“Oh, that's an economy.” 

“What would you call it if tele- 
kinesis and teleportation moved 
goods and people without the 
transplat?” 

“ Without the transplat?" he al- 
most shouted. “But you — but 
we — ” 

“We’d all be in the same boat 
with those operators you’re re- 
placing.” 

“The op — I never thought 
about them!” 

She nodded. 

Shaken, he mused, “I wonder 
why the Private never thought 
of that when I told him about 
it this morning.” 

There was a dry, delighted 
sound from deep in the old chest. 
“He wouldn’t. He never did un- 
derstand how anything works. 
He just rides it.” 

R OAN controlled himsejf. One 
did not listen to criticism of 
one’s parents. But this was Great 
Mam herself. The effort for con- 
trol helped bring the whole 
strange conversation into per- 



spective and he laughed weakly. 
“Well, I hardly think we’re go- 
ing to have any such — economy — 
as that.” 

She raised her eyebrows. “This 
progress we were talking about. 
You know, even in my time most 
folks had the idea that humans 
planned human progress. But 
when you come to think of it, the 
first human who walked upright 
didn’t do it because he wanted to. 
He did it because he already 
could.” When she saw no re- 
sponse on his face, she added, 
“What I mean is that if the old- 
timers were right and progress 
can’t be corked up, then it’s just 
going to bust loose. And if it busts 
loose, it’s going to do it whether 
you’re the head of J. & D. Walsh 
or a slag-mucker, whether you’re 
happy about it or not.” 

"Well, I don’t think it will hap- 
pen.” 

“Haven’t you been listening to 
me? It’s always been with us.” 
“Then why didn’t they — why 
should it show up now and not a 
thousand years from now?” 

“We never stopped progressing 
before — not like this,” she said, 
with a sweeping glance at the 
walls and ceiling which clearly 
indicated the entire planet. 

“Granny, do you want this to 
happen? You?" 

“What I want doesn’t matter. 
There’ve always been people who 
had — powers. All I’m suggesting 



24

is that now, of all times, is the 
moment for them to develop — 
now that we don’t develop in any 
other way.” 

He was persistent. “You think 
it’s a good thing, then?” 

She hesitated. “Look at me, 
how old I am. Is that a good 
thing? It doesn’t matter — it hap- 
pened — it had to happen.” 

“Why have you told me this?” 
he whispered. 

“Because you asked me what 
was occupying me,” she said, 
“and I figured to tell you, for a 
change. Frighten you?” 
Sheepishly, he nodded. 

She did, too, and laughed. “Do 
you good. In my day, we were 
frightened a whole lot. It took us 
a long way.” 

He shook his head. Do yov 
good? He failed to see what good 
could come of any so-called 
“progress” that threatened the 
transplat. Why, what would hap- 
pen to things? What would hap- 
pen to their very way of life — to 
privacy itself, if anyone could — 
what was it, teleport? — teleport 
into a man’s office or cubicle . 

“Look, boy, you don’t have to 
wait until it’s your turn to come 
chat with your old Granny, you 
know. Come over anytime you 
have something to talk about. 
Just let me know first, that’s all.” 
There was nothing in life he 
wanted less than another session 
like this one, but he remembered 



to thank her. “Byemam.” 

“Byeboy.” 

He rushed out to the dialpost 
and feverishly got the number of 
his home. He stepped up on the 
platform and the last he saw of 
Granny’s face through the open 
panel was her expression of — was 
it pity? 

Or perhaps compassion was a 
better name for it.

TTE went straight to his cubicle, 
brushing past his sister as 
she stood at the edge of the court. 
He thought she was going to 
speak, but deliberately showed 
his back and quickened his stride. 
Her kind of smugness, her end- 
less, placid recitations of her 
day’s occupations, were the prime 
thing he could do without at the 
moment. He needed privacy, lots 
of it, and right now. 

He leaned back against the 
panel when it closed. His head 
spun. It was a head which had 
the ability to thrust indigestible 
ideas into compartments, there 
to seal them off from one another 
until he had time to ruminate. 
This was how he was able to 
handle so many concurrent busi- 
ness affairs. It was also how he 
had been able to get through 
this extraordinary day — till then. 
But the compartments were full; 
nothing else must happen.

He had awakened before day- 
light to see, in the soft glow of 
the walls, a girl in a flowing gar- 
ment who regarded him gravely. 
Her hair had been golden and her 
hands were clasped over one knee. 
He had not been able to see her 
feet — not then. 

He had stepped on the ’plat 
to get to the office and had ar- 
rived, instead, in an unmention- 
able place containing drapes and 
this same girl. She had spoken to 
him. 

He had seen her again, perched 
on his desk. 

He had lost two hours in an 
unwonted self-examination, which 
had left him bewildered and un- 
sure of himself, and had gone 
most respectably to see his most 
respectable grandmother, who 
had filled him full of the most 
frightening conjectures he had 
ever experienced — including the 
one which brought this mad busi- 
ness full circle. For she had sug- 
gested to him that, by a force 
called tele - something - or - other, 
certain people might appear just 
anywhere, transplat or no trans- 
plat. 

He snorted. You didn’t need a 
transplat to have a dream! He 
had dreamed the girl here and in 
the draped court. He had dream- 
ed her in the office. “There!” he 
said to himself. “Feel better?” 

No. 

Anyone who had dreams like 



that had to be off his ’plat. 

All right: they weren't dreams. 

In which case, Granny was 
right; someone had something so 
much better than a transplat that 
the world — his world — would 
come to an end. If only this 
were a technologial development, 
it could be stopped, banned, to 
maintain the Stasis. But it wasn’t 
— it was some weird, illogical, un- 
controllable mystery known to 
only certain people and he, Roan, 
wasn't one of them. 

It was unthinkable, insupport- 
able. Indecent! 

G OING into his flower shop, 
he reached for his dinner ra- 
tion. He grunted in surprise, for 
instead of the usual four tablets 
and tumbler of vitabroth, his 
hand fell on something hot, 
slightly greasy and fibrous. He 
lifted it, turned it over. It was 
like nothing edible he had ever 
seen before. On the other hand, 
there had been innovations from 
time to time, as the Nutrient 
Service saw fit to allow for this or 
that change in the environment, 
the isolation of mutated bacteria 
and their antibiotics, the results 
of their perpetual inventory of 
sample basals. 

But this thing was far too big 
to be swallowed. Maybe, he 
thought suddenly, it was a com- 
bination of nutrients and rough- 
age. 



26

His teeth sank readily into it. 
Hot, reddish juice dribbled down 
his chin and a flavor excruciat- 
ingly delectable filled his mouth 
and throat, his nostrils and, it 
seemed, his very eyes. It was so 
good, it made his jaw-hinges 
ache. 

He demolished the entire por- 
tion before it had a chance to get 
cold, then heaved a marveling 
sigh. He fumbled about the food- 
shelf in the vain hope of finding 
more — but that was all, except 
for the usual broth. He lifted the 
cup, then turned and carefully 
poured it down the sink. Nothing 
was going to wash that incredible 
flavor out of his mouth as long 
as he could help it. 

He slipped into his dressing 
shield and changed rapidly. As he 
transferred his wallet, he paused 
to glance into it to see if it 
needed replenishing. 

He grunted with the impact 
of memory. As he had left the 
Private’s office, he had come face 
to face with his — with that — well, 
dream or no, there she had been. 
And had disappeared. And on the 
corner of his desk, just where 
she had sat, had been the ’plat 
number — this number, here in his 
hand. 

Like the dream she was — 
wasn’t she? — the girl had not 
spoken to him here in his cubicle 
or in the office. But in the draped 
court she had. That episode, im- 

GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



probable as it seemed, could 
hardly have been a dream. He 
had dialed that transplat to get 
there. He might have misdialed, 
but he had been wide awake 
when he did it. 

She must be one of those — those 
next-step-upward monsters Gran- 
ny was talking about, he decided. 
He had to know, had to speak to 
her again. Not because of her 
hair, of course, or the brazen 
garment. It was because of the 
transplat, because of the hard- 
won Stasis that held society to- 
gether. It was a citizen’s simple 
duty to his higher pink toes. 
No, his higher self. 

TIE adjusted a fresh pair of 
gloves and strode out to the 
court. Valerie was still there, 
looking wistful. 

“Roan!” 

“Later,” he barked, already 
spinning the dial. 

“Please! Only a minute!” 

“I haven’t got a minute,” he 
snapped and stepped up on the 
platform. The flicker of black- 
ness cut off her pleading. 

He stepped down from his ar- 
rival platform and stopped dead. 

No drapes! No perfume! No — 
oh, holy Private in Heaven! 

“Roan Walsh!” squeaked Cor- 
sonmay. The secretary’s eyeballs 
all but stood out on her dry 
cheekbones. Under them, her 
hands — decently gloved, thank 

27 



the powers — were pressed, and in 
her hair obscenely hung a comb 
which, he deduced, he had in- 
terrupted in midstroke. He saw 
instantly what had happened, 
and a coruscation of fury and em- 
barrassment spun dazzlingly in- 
side him. 

She must have seen him throw 
away the number she had written 
down for him and supplied him 
with another. And he had had to 
go and assume that it was ... oh, 
to expect the drapes, the arms, 
the — and all that — and to come 
face to face with this! 

“Private!" she shrilled. "Mam! 
Mam /” Calling her parents. Well, 
of course. Any decent girl would. 

He dived for the dialpost. So 
did she, but he got there first. 

“Don’t go, Roan Walsh,” she 
panted. “Corsonmay and my 
father, they’re not here, they 
would have been if only I’d 
known, they’ll be back soon, so 
please don’t go.” 

“Look,” he said, “I found the 
number on my desk and I thought 
Grig Labine had left it there. I 
was supposed to see him and I’m 
late now. I’m sorry I invaded 
your privacy, but it was a mis- 
take, see? Just a mistake.” 

The eagerness faded from her 
almost-wrinkled face and homely 
hot eyes. She seemed to shrink 
two inches in a tenth of a second. 
Her mouth pouted, wet and pa- 
thetic, and quivering puckers 



appeared at its sides. Oh, you 
stinker, what did she ever do to 
you? he said to himself. 

“Be serene,” he blurted. He 
dialed his home. 

“Oh-h-h-h . .’’ Her wail was 
cut off by the transplat. 

He stood where he was, his eyes 
squeezed closed on his embarrass- 
ment, and breathed hard. 

And then he became aware of a 
whimpering “Please . and, for 
one awful moment, thought Cor- 
sonmay’s transplat had not op- 
erated. He opened his eyes 
cautiously and then sighed and 
stepped down. He was home. It 
was Valerie who was whimpering. 

“Well, what’s the matter with 
you?” he asked. 

“Roan,” she wept, “ please don’t 
be angry with me. I know I was 
a beast. It was just — oh, I meant 
it, but I didn’t have to be so . 

“What are you talking about?” 

“When you called about want- 
ing me to go to Granny’s.” 

T HAT seemed so long ago and 
so completely trivial. “For- 
get it, Val. You were absolutely 
right. I went, so forget it.” 
“You’re not mad?” 

“Of course I’m not.” 

“Well, I’m glad, because I want 
to talk to you. Can I?” she 
begged. 

This was unusual. “What 
about?” 

“Can we go out, Roan?” 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Where are the parents?” 

“In the Family Room. We can 
be right back. Please, Roan,” she 
pleaded. 

He yielded. In his cosmos, Val 
was merely a perennial and harm- 
le* irritation; this was probably 
the first time he had consciously 
realized that she might be a per- 
son, too, with personal problems. 

“Grosvenor Center?” he asked. 

She nodded. He dialed it and 
stepped up on the platform and 
down again at Grosvenor. It was 
still daylight there and he won- 
dered vaguely where on Earth it 
might be. The sea on one side 
was an evening blue, the moun- 
taintop a glory. 

Val appeared on the transplat 
and stepped down. They walked 
silently past the decorator and the 
Fad and Fashion and the restau- 
rant until they reached the park. 
They sat down side by side on a 
bench, with its shoulder-high par- 
titions between each seat, and 
looked at the fountain. 

She was very pale and her 
shoulders were moving under the 
cape, a complex motion that was 
partly stifled sobs and partly the 
kneading of hands. 

He said, as gently as he could, 
“What’s up?” 

“You don’t like me." 

“Aw, sure I do. You’re all 
right.” 

“No, please don’t like me. I 
don’t want you to. I came to you 



because you don’t like me.” 

This was completely incom- 
prehensible to Roan. He decided 
that listening might extract more 
data than talking. 

Valerie said in a low voice, 
“I’ve got to tell you something 
that would make you hate me if 
you didn’t already, so that’s why. 
Oh, Roan, I’m no good!” 

He opened his mouth to deny 
this, but closed it silently. He 
had the. wit not to agree with 
her, either. 

“There’s somebody I — saw. I 
have to see him again, talk with 
him. He’s — I want — Oh!" she 
cried, and burst into tears. 

T> OAN fumbled for a clean 
-''•handkerchief and passed it 
deftly around the front of the 
partition, down low. He felt it 
taken from his fingers. 

“A May’s supposed to wait,” 
she said brokenly, “and one day 
her Private will come looking for 
her, and he will be her Private, 
and she will be his help and 
service until the end. But I don’t 
want to be help and service to 
the Private who comes. Who 
knows, one might come any min- 
ute. I want this one to come!” 
“Maybe he will,” soothed 
Roan. “Who is he?” 

“I don’t knowl” she said in 
agony. “I only saw him. Roan, 
you have to find him for me.” 
“Well, where — ” 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



29 



“He’s tall, as tall as you,” she 
said hurriedly. “His eyes are 
green. He has — ” she gulped and 
her voice sank — "long hair, only 
not like a May. And right on the 
bottom of his chin there’s a little 
cleft and on one side---yes, on the 
left side — there’s a little curl of 
a scar.” 

“Hair? Men don’t have long 
hair!” 

“This one has.” 

“Now look,” he said, suppress- 
ing his laughter at the outlandish 
concept. “If there were such a 
man, long hair and all, every- 
body' d know where he is.” 

“Yes,” she said miserably. 

“So there you are. There’s no 
such man.” 

“But there is! I saw him!” 
“Where?” She was silent. He 
said impatiently, “If you don’t 
tell me where, how can I find 
him?” 

"I can’t tell you,” she said at 
last, painfully. “It doesn’t mat- 
ter — you’d never find him — 
there.” She colored. “He must be 
somewhere else, too. Please find 
him, Roan. His name. Where he 
is. Even if he never — I’d like to 
know what his name is,” she 
finished wistfully. She stood up. 
“The Private will miss us.” 

On the way back to the trans- 
plat, she said to the air straight 
in front of her, “You think I’m 
just awful, don’t you?” 

“No!” he said warmly. “Some- 




30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







times I think everyone’s just a 
little different from what the 
Stasis expects. It isn’t ‘awful’ to 
be a little different.” And his sub- 
conscious, instead of objecting, 
dropped its prim jaw in aston- 
ishment. 

V 

'T'HE Family Room was the 
heart of their house, as such 
rooms were to every house on 
Earth. A chair — virtually a throne 
— dominated one wall. It held the 
video controls and the audio 
beams which came to audible 
focus in their proper places in 
the room — the miniature of the 
throne at the right wall, which 
was the place of the son of the 
house; the wooden bench at the 
left, which was the daughter’s; 
and the small stool at the throne’s 
foot, where the mother sat. 

The room, because of its beams 
and its padded floor and acous- 
tically dead walls and ceiling, was 
a silent one and it was the custom 
for- each family to convene there 
for two hours at the end of the 
day. There were stylized prayers, 
such reading as the Private chose, 
whatever conversation he dic- 
tated and. when he was so moved, 
transmitted entertainment of his 
choice for the clan. 

When Roan and Valerie en- 
tered, the original silence was 
compounded by towering disap- 

GRANNY WON'T KNIT 31 



proval. The Private’s hand lay on 
the video control, which he had 
just switched off. The Mam’s 
head had bobbed once, sidewise, 
so engrossed had she been in the 
program; it was if a prop had 
been snatched away. 

Son and daughter separated 
and went to their places. Roan 
felt the old hovering terror as the 
Private’s gaze flicked across his 
withers like a rowel. He sat down 
and glanced quickly at his sister. 
She huddled on her bench so op- 
pressed, so indrawn, that even 
her wrinkle-free, foldless gar- 
ments could not conceal her 
crushed look. Roan, with hands 
properly folded, swallowed ap- 
prehensively. 

“Late,” said the Private. “ Both 
of you. This sort of thing can 
hardly help in my recommenda- 
tions, Valerie, you unwanted 
creature.” This was an idiom 
used in chastising all Mays and 
passed Valerie by. Then, to Roan, 
“One would assume that my gen- 
erosity and forgiveness” — that 
would be the hint about the part- 
nership — “would result in at least 
a minimal effort not to repeat the 
offense. You are thirty years of 
age — old enough to know the 
difference between Stasis and 
chaos. You will be confined, by 
my personal lock, to your cubicle 
for forty-eight hours, where you 
may reflect on the consequences 
of disorganization. ValerieV* 



She twitched and gave the 
proper response, which was to 
meet his eyes. Roan said nothing. 
In such occasions, there was no 
appeal. 

“Valerie, were you and your 
brother together in whatever es- 
capade it was that led you to 
flout the organization of this 
house?” 

“Yes, Private, but it was really 
my — ” 

“Then you must bear the same 
punishment- — not primarily for 
being tardy, which is not one of 
your habitual defects, but for 
your failure to use your influence 
on your irresponsible sibling. I 
assume you failed to try, since it 
would be too painful for me to 
conclude that both my offspring 
lacked the basic elements of 
decency.” 

A NOTHER massive silence fol- 
lowed. The mother, sitting at 
his feet, rolled her eyes upward 
to the cushions, where his gloved 
hand lay. With a slight, uncon- 
scious movement, her ear sought 
the focal point of the currently 
non-existent audio beam. The 
Private’s beard bulged as he 
dropped his glare upon her. 

“And since I must cling to a 
single shred of satisfaction,” he 
said, “let it be my faith in your 
knowledge of correct behavior, 
Mam. Assuming that this knowl- 
edge exists, the circumstance 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



clearly indicates that you too 
have not properly applied it. 
There will therefore be no video 
for you tonight.” He unleashed a 
semi-circular glare in which his 
beard smote across their presences 
like the back of a hand. “Leave 
me.” 

They rose and shuffled out. 
The panel slid shut behind them. 
"I’m sorry.” Val barely breathed 
the apology. 

“Silence!” roared the grille over 
the door. 

.They hung their heads and 
waited. Walshmam tiptoed away 
and returned in a moment with 
two small cubes. She led Valerie 
to her cubicle and stood aside. 
Valerie glanced once at Roan, 
who twitched a dismal smile at 
her. Then the panel slid shut on 
her and Walshmam pressed one 
of the cubes into its socket, effec- 
tively sealing the door until re- 
moved again from this side. True 
to custom, Roan waited until she 
passed him and then shuffled 
along behind her to his own 
cubicle. 

“And furthermore,” enounced 
the grille over the door, “I here- 
with refuse to consider the merits 
of the suggestion you made this 
morning. For, if good, it issues 
from an unworthy source and is 
tainted — if bad, it deserves no 
consideration.” 

Walshmam seemed very sad, 
but then few Mams were any- 



thing else. Their lives alternated 
between silent patience and silent 
regret, with only an occasional 
flicker of preventive action. He 
grimaced in an effort to convey a 
certain camaraderie, but she mis- 
understood and looked away, and 
he knew she had taken it as a 
rebellious or unrepentant expres- 
sion. 

He wondered, as he dropped 
the dressing shield over his head, 
what would happen if he got up 
and hauled on the Private’s 
beard. 

Reaching for his brief night- 
shirt and sleeping shorts and bed- 
shoes, he told himself, “I bet he 
hasn’t even got anything in his 
rulebook to cover that. And he 
never was so good with a new 
idea.” 

That reminded him of what 
Granny had said — the Private 
“never did understand how any- 
thing works. He just rides it.” 
He sure rides his family, Roan 
thought. 

CO he himself would be a Pri- 
^ vate some day, have a family 
and get it all back again, he 
thought sleepily, and let himself 
sink down and down into a place 
where he sat on a monstrous 
throne with a beard to his knees, 
and watched his father, who sat 
on the boy’s chair, weeping. At 
his feet was — well, for heaven’s 
sake, it was Granny! 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT

A T some point, it must have 
turned into a nightmare — a 
dreadful fragment involving be- 
ing lost in the flicker of final 
black that one experienced on 
the transplat. Here, however, he 
was immersed in it, with dimen- 
sionless space at his freezing back 
and the unyielding “inner” sur- 
face of reality pressing into his 
face. He cried out and struggled 
— and thumped his cheekbone 
on solid rock. He yelped and 
pressed away from the rock and 
sat up. 

Not an inch from his head was 
the lintel of a shimmering, rec- 
tangular rock. Beyond it, a pale, 
green, alien sky which brighten- 
ed by the moment. 

He glanced behind him and 
saw nothing but purple plain, 
cracked and crevassed, from 
which cactuslike spears sprout- 
ed grotesquely. 

He stepped through the door- 
way and, a few yards beyond, 
the desolation abruptly ended. 
Before him stretched rolling park- 
land, then a curving line of trees 
following a brook. Across the 
brook were fields — one brown, 
one tan, one a tender green — 
and they seemed, at this distance, 
as smooth as the surface of a 
cup of milk. To the right were 
mountains, one with a flaming 
cap so brilliant, his eyes stung. 
He recognized it as dawnlight on 
snow. To the left was a broad 



rolling valley. The air was warm 
but sparkling-fresh. 

He paused and inhaled deeply, 
seeking comprehension, then saw, 
to his right, a boulder as big as 
a Private chair. On the boulder 
sat a girl with golden hair and 
strange eyes. She wore a belted 
singlet that revealed far more 
girl than Roan had ever seen 
before. She held one delicately 
bronzed, bare knee in both hands. 
Her bare feet acknowledged the 
snowfire pinkly, and they were 
wet with dew. 

She laughed a greeting and 
rose and flowed over to him. 
“Come along,” she said. 

He clutched himself and hid 
his naked hands. With a swift, 
strong movement, she had his 
hand in hers. 

“Up we go,” she sang and, be- 
fore he could think, she was lead- 
ing him. 

His cheek touched her bare 
shoulder. He smelled her per- 
fume and her sweet breath, and 
his eyes rolled up and his knees 
sagged. Her arm went briefly 
round his shoulders and she 
laughed again. 

“It’s all right, it’s only a 
dream,” she told him. 

“A dre — ” he coughed — 
“earn?” 

“Thirsty?” She held out her 
hand, and he started violently 
when a cup appeared in it. “Here 
you are.”

TTE took it, hesitated, then rais- 
ed it. She still stood, smiling 
at him. Modestly he turned his 
back and drank. It was bright 
orange, cold, sweet-acid and de- 
licious. He patted his lips care- 
fully and turned back, waving 
the cup helplessly. 

“Throw it,” she said. 

“Th — what?” 

She gestured. Obediently, he 
tossed the cup straight up. It 
vanished. 

“Feel better? Come on, they’re 
all waiting for you.” 

Gaping up at the spot into 
which the cup had vanished, 
Roan said. “I want to go home.” 

“You can’t. Not until the 
dream’s finished.” 

He put his arms straight down 
and fluttered his hands until the 
cuffs concealed them. “I want 
to go home,” he said forlornly. 

“Why?” 

“I just . .” He looked long- 
ingly over his shoulder at the 
doorway. When he looked back, 
she was gone. And suddenly, ur- 
gently, he wanted her back. He 
took a step forward. 

“Boo!” she said, her lips just 
touching the nape of his neck. 

He whirled, and there she 
stood. “Where were you?” 

“Here — anywhere.” She van- 
ished and reappeared instantly 
at his right. 

“Please,” he said, “don’t do 
that any more. And just let me 



stand here quietly for a minute.” 

“All right.” She wandered 
away, picked a snowdrop and a 
strange green -and -purple flower, 
added a fern-frond and came 
back toward him, her fingers 
deft and a-dance. She held out 
the flowers, woven into a tiny 
circular wreath, and spun them 
on her finger. Then she set them 
into her golden hair. 

“Pretty?” 

“Yes.” His eyes fell away 
from her and were dragged back 
again. “Why don’t you cover 
your arms?” he blurted. 

“We wear what we please 
here.” 

“Where is here?” 

“Sort of another world.” He 
glanced back at the gateway. “It 
wouldn’t do any good,” she ex- 
plained. “There isn’t anything in 
there now but blackness. The 
way out is a time, not a place. 
Don’t be afraid. You’ll go back 
when it’s time.” 

“When?” 

“How long did you have to 
sleep?” 

“Forty-eight hours, though I’d 
never — ” 

“Maybe you can stay that 
long. Who’s to know?” 

“You’re — sure I’ll get back in 
time?” 

“Sure as sure. Is it all right 
now?” 

Shyly, he smiled. “Fine. Every- 
thing’s fine.”

S HE took his hand, and skipped 
two paces, so he had to fol- 
low. He tried politely to tug his 
hand free, but she held fast and 
seemed not to notice. A giggle, 
a blush, the slightest sign of self- 
consciousness in her, and he 
would have found the contact 
unbearable. 

But she was so completely at 
ease that the revulsion would not 
come, and she chattered so gaily, 
making him answer, keeping him 
busy, that, even had he felt like 
asking her to let go, he had no 
space for the words, nor the 
words with which to do it. 

“You were in my cubicle,” he 
said breathlessly, as she hurried 
him down the slope. 

"Oh, yes — more than you know. 
I watch you sleep. You sleep 
nicely. There’s a tanager!” She 
stopped, balancing, something 
flowing out of her shining face 
to the blazing bird and back 
again. “I came to see you at your 
office, too. Everything’s straight 
and hard there, and sort of lone- 
ly. But all you people are lonely.” 
“We’re not!” 

“You wait until the dream’s 
finished and you won’t say that. 
Want to see a magic?” She 
stooped, still walking, and brush- 
ed her long fingers across a thick 
growth of tiny spiked leaves. 
They all closed up like little 
green fists. 

“Why’d you come?” he asked. 



“Because you were ready to 
wonder.” 

“Wonder what?” 

She appeared not to consider 
this worth answering, but releas- 
ed his hand and bounded like a 
deer once, twice, then high over 
a brook. He floundered through 
it, soaking his bedshoes. 

When he caught up with her, 
she touched his chest. 

“Shh!” 

On the wind floated a note, 
then another note and, high and 
sweet, another, so that they be- 
came a chord. Then a note chang- 
ed, and another, and another, 
and the chorus of voices modu- 
lated softly, like the aurora, 
which is the same as long as one 
looks, but changes if one looks 
away and back. 

W HAT’S your name?” he 
asked abruptly. 

“What would you like it to 
be?” 

“Flower!" he cried, the strange 
pressures of a dream asserting 
themselves; and with it he felt 
a liberation from the filth with 
which custom had clothed the 
word. 

"And you’re Roan, and a roan 
is a horse with wind in his mane 
and thunder in his feet, sweet- 
nostriled, wild-eyed, all courage 
and speed.” 

He thought it was a phrase 
from a song, yet it could have 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been speech — her speech. He 
squished the water in his muddy 
shoes and almost whinnied with 
delight at the thought of the 
thunder in his feet. She took his 
hand again and they leaped to- 
gether to the brow of a foothill. 
Ahead, the song finished in a roar 
of good laughter. 

“Who is it?” he wanted to 
know. 

“You’ll see. There — there!” 

Where the hill shouldered into 
the forest was a clear, deep pool. 
In the forest and on the hillside, 
buildings nestled. Their walls 
were logs and their roofs were 
thatch. They were low and wide, 
and very much part of the hill 
and the woods. In the clearing 
between woods and slope, by the 
pool, was a great trestle table 
and, around the table, were the 
people who had been singing — 
you could tell by the sound of 
their laughter. 

“I can’t — I can't!” Roan croak- 
ed miserably. 

“Why, what’s the matter?” 
asked Flower. 

“They have no decency!” 

“There are only two things 
which are indecent — fear and ex- 
cess — and you’ll see neither here. 
Look again.” 

“So many limbs,” he breathed. 
“And the colors — a green-and-red 
man, a blue woman . .” 

“A blue dress and a harlequin 
suit. It’s grand to wear colors.” 



“There are some things one 
shouldn’t even dream.” 

"Oh, no! There’s nothing you 
can’t dream. Come and see.” 
They went to see. They were 
made very welcome. 

VI 

A T dusk, on the second day, 
Flower and Roan walked a 
shadowed aisle in the forest. 
Roan’s sleeping garments were 
tattered and seam-gutted, for 
he would not give them up, 
though they had not been de- 
signed for the brutality they had 
suffered. Yet he did not mind 
the rips and gapes, for no one 
else did. His bedshoes were long 
gone and he felt that if he were 
told he would never again feel 
the coolth of moss under his bare 
feet, or the tumble of brook- 
sand, he would die. He knew the 
Earth as something more than 
a place on which to float sealed 
cities. He had worked till he hurt, 
laughed till he cried, slept till he 
was healed. He had helped with 
a saw, with a stone, with a song. 
Wonder on wonder, and greatest 
wonder of all — the children. 

He had never seen any before. 
He did not know where children 
came from except that, when 
they were twelve, they went to 
their families from the creches. 
He did not know how they were 
born. He did know that each 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



37 



child was educated specifically 
for a place in his Family and in 
the Stasis, and that the largest 
part of this education was a 
scrubbing and soaking and rub- 
bing in of the presence of the 
father — his voice, features, man- 
ners of living and speaking and 
working. When the child emerg- 
ed, there was a place for him in 
the home, by then very little 
different from his last place in 
the crfcche, and he was fitted to 
it, not by the accidental author- 
ity of parentage, but through the 
full-time labors of a bank of 
specialists. 

Each family had one boy, one 
girl— one trade, one aim. This 
was how an economy could be 
balanced and kept balanced. This 
was how the community could 
raise its young and still maintain 
the family. 

But here, in this dream . 

Children babbled and sang and 
burned their fingers. They ran 
howling underfoot and swam like 
seals in the pool. They fought 
and, later, loved. They grieved, 
sweated, made their music and 
their mistakes. It was all very 
chaotic and perplexing and made 
for a strong, sane settlement 
which knew how to laugh and 
how to profit from an argument. 
It was barbarous and very beau- 
tiful. 

And it had a power — for these 
people quite casually did what 



Roan had seen Flower do. They 
seemed to have a built-in trans- 
plat and could send and receive 
from anywhere to anywhere. 
They could reach up into noth- 
ingness and take down bread or 
a hatchet or a book. They could 
stand silently for a time and 
then know what a wife would 
serve for nutrient — which they 
brazenly sat together to eat, 
though they went privately for 
other functions no more disgust- 
ing — or the tune of a new song 
or news of a find of berries. 

They seemed willing enough to 
tell him how all this was done, 
yet his questions got him no- 
where. It was as if he needed a 
new language or perhaps a new 
way of thinking before he could 
absorb the simple essence. But 
for all their power, they had 
callouses on their hands. They 
burned wood as fuel and ate the 
yield of the land around them. 
To put it most simply, they 
made their bodies function at 
optimum because it made them 
joyful. They never let the psi 
factor turn, cancerlike, from a 
convenience to a luxury. 

CO Roan walked quietly in the 
^ dusk, Flower at his side, 
thinking about these things and 
trying to shake them down into 
a shape he could contain. “But, 
of course, this isn’t real,” he said 
suddenly. 



38

“Just a dream,” nodded 
Flower. 

“I’ll wake.” 

“Very soon.” She laughed then 
and took his hands. “Don’t look 
so mournful. We’re never very 
far away!” 

He couldn’t laugh with her. “I 
know, but I feel that this is — I 
can’t say it, Flower. I don’t know 
how!” 

“Then don’t try for now.” 

Before he knew it, his arms 
were around her. “Flower — please 
let me stay.” 

She stirred in his arms. “Don’t 
make me sad,” she whispered. 

“Why can’t I? Why?” 

“Because it’s your dream, not 
mine.” 

“I won’t let you go! I’ll hold 
onto you and I won’t wake up!” 
He staggered then and fell heavi- 
ly. Flower stood calmly ten feet 
away. 

“Don’t make me sad,” she said 
again. “It hurts me to push you 
away like this.” 

He climbed slowly to his feet 
and held out his hand. “I won’t 
spoil any more of it,” he said 
huskily. 

They walked silently in the 
dimness, toward the shaft of light 
which the Sun lay up the valley 
to the settlement each evening 
at this season. 

“How soon?” he asked, be- 
cause he could not help himself. 

“When it’s time,” she said. She 



released his hand, put her arm 
through his and took his hand 
again. They came to the light. 

Roan looked slowly from one 
end of the clearing to the other, 
trying to see it as it had been 
to him at first, then as it was 
with the familiarity of two days. 
There was the kettle they used, 
they said, to make sugar from the 
maples, and he pretended he had 
seen it boil, seen the frantic dogs 
snapping the caramelized sweet- 
meat up from the snow and run- 
ning in circles frantically until it 
melted and they could get their 
silly mouths open again. There 
was the bdckwheat field which 
would carpet the spring snow with 
quick emerald on a warm day. 
There was the pond, there the 
ducks with old-ivory webs and 
mother-of-pearl lost in their 
necks. He saw — 

“There!” he yelled and twisted 
away from Flower, to go racing 
across the clearing. “You!” he 
shouted. “You! Stop! You by the 
pool!” 

But the man did not turn. He 
was tall, as tall as Roan; his hair 
was very long, his eyes were 
green and, at the side of his cleft 
chin, was a curl of a scar. In 
the water, there was a chuckle of 
laughter, a flash of white. 

“You with the scar,” Roan 
gasped. “Your name — I’ve got to 
know your — ” 

As the man turned, Roan look- 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT

ed past his shoulder, down at the 
water, straight into the startled 
eyes of his sister Valerie. 

And that was the end of the 
dream. 

O NLY one good thing had 
happened since his mother 
had removed the block from his 
cubicle door. The cubicle itself 
had been the most depressing 
conceivable place to wake up in; 
its walls crushed him, its filtered 
air made him cough. It had no 
space, no windows. The dressing 
shield brought out a thudding in 
his temple and he hurled it to the 
floor, turning violently away from 
it, physically and mentally. He 
felt that if he itemized the sym- 
bolism of that tubular horror, he 
would go berserk and tear this 
coffin-culture apart corpse by 
corpse. Breakfast was an abhor- 
rence. The clothes — well, he put 
them on, not daring to be angry 
about them, or he never would 
have gotten to the office. 

Corsonmay looked his way 
only long enough to identify, 
then stuck her silly flaccid face 
in a file-drawer until he was safe- 
ly in his office. He looked at the 
desk, its efficient equipment, at 
the vise-jaws called walls and the 
descending heel called a ceiling, 
and he shook with anger. But he 
was weak with it when the heavy 
voice issued from the grille : “Step 
in here, Roan Walsh.” 



Trouble again. Out of the pris- 
on into the courtroom. 

He took four great breaths, 
three for composure, one a sigh. 
He went to the panel and it ad- 
mitted him. His father sat back, 
his head and beard vying tex- 
ture against texture. Before him 
was a scattering of field reports, 
and he looked as if he had nib- 
bled the corner off one of them 
and found it unexpectedly good. 
“Good Stasis, Private.” 

The old man nodded curtly. 
“Your absence made it necessary 
for me to take up the threads of 
your work as well as my own. 
You will find what I have done 
on reports subsequent to yours.” 
He stacked the cards neatly and 
scattered them. “On reviewing 
these, I found to my surprise — 
my pleasant surprise, I may add 
in all fairness — that you have 
done a phenomenal amount of 
work. Kimberley, Krasniak, that 
warehouse tangle in Polska. And 
in spite of its speed, the work is 
good. I investigated it in detail.” 
This, thought Roan, sounded 
really bad. He put his hands be- 
hind him, lowered his chin in 
The Stance, and set his teeth. 

“The investigation brings out,” 
lumbered the vocal juggernaut, 
“that the work was done in rough- 
ly speaking four hours, three and 
one-half minutes. Very good. It 
seems, further, that the elapsed 
time involved was five hours, 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



forty -eight minutes and some odd 
seconds. Approximately, that is.” 
He tapped the edges of the cards 
on the desk, flickered the light- 
ning at Roan, then snapped for- 
ward and roared, “One hour and 
forty-five minutes seem to have 
disappeared here!” 

R OAN wet his lips and croak- 
ed, “There was noonrest, 
Private.” 

The Private leaned back and 
stretched jovially. “Splendid, my 
efficient young scoundrel. Su- 
perb! And what is the noonrest 
permitted us at our present alti- 
tude in the organization?” 
“Forty minutes, Private.” 
“Good. Now all we have to 
account for is one hour and five 
minutes. Sixty-five precious, ir- 
redeemable minutes, which the 
resources of Stasis itself could not 
buy back. Over an hour unre- 
ported, yet somehow a double- 
time dock from your wages is not 
entered here. Or perhaps it is 
entered and, in my haste, I over- 
looked it.” 

“No, Private.” 

“Then either one or more trans- 
actions of company affairs were 
handled on that afternoon and 
not reported — which is gross in- 
efficiency— or the time was spent 
on idling and personal indul- 
gence, with every intention of 
accepting payment from the firm 
for this time — which is stealing.” 



Roan said nothing except to 
himself, and that was, almost de- 
tachedly, “I think I can stand 
about four minutes, thirty-two 
and three-tenths seconds — ap- 
proximate — more of this.” 

“The picture is hardly a pleas- 
ant one,” said the Private con- 
versationally, and smiled. “The 
records give me the choice of 
three courses of action. First, the 
time owed may be made up. 
Second, the value of these hours 
may be paid back. Third, I can 
turn you over to Central Court 
with a full indictment, and there- 
by wash my hands of you. You 
Slight be given a bow and arrow 
and left to make your way in 
the wilderness between segments 
of Stasis. You could survive a 
long time with your training. 
Days. Weeks even.” 

“Eighteen, seventeen, sixteen 
. .” Roan counted silently. 

“However, I am going to give 
you every opportunity to ame- 
liorate this — this frightful crime. 
Take these cards into your office. 
You have between now and 1600 
— a punctual 1600, that is — in or 
out of the office, to revise any 
slight miscalculations you may 
have made and to refresh your 
memory in the event that you did 
useful work for the firm in any 
of these lost minutes. Every al- 
teration you make, of course, will 
be checked fo the tenth of a sec- 
ond. Until 1600 — be serene.”

Roan, quite numb, tottered for- 
ward, took the cards, muttered, 
“Byepry,” and awkwardly back- 
ed out. 

Why, he wondered, did he 
stand for it? 

Because there was no place to 
go, of course. 

There was . 

No, there wasn’t. That had 
been a dream. 

He sank into a black paralysis 
of rage. 

VII 

fTTHE phone roused him. He re- 
ceived, ready to tear the head 
off the caller, any caller. But it 
was Valerie. 

She said, “It’s nearly noon- 
rest.” She would not meet his 
eyes. “Could you — would you 
mind . .?” 

“Same place, right away?” 

“Oh, thank you, Roan!” 

He growled affectionately and 
broke off. 

She was not at the Grosvenor 
transplat when he got there, so 
he stalked straight to the park. 
She was waiting for him. He 
dropped down next to her and 
put his head in his hands — and 
damn the passers-by. Never seen 
a man’s hands before? 

He sat up after a while, how- 
ever; Valerie’s silence positively 
radiated. , He wondered if he 
should tell her about the man in 



the dream, and almost laughed. 
But he could not laugh at Valerie. 
Not now. In the dream, there 
had been love. Valerie, in her 
crushed, priggish way, had fall- 
en in love. All right, tell her you 
still haven’t found the guy and 
then sympathize with her and 
get it over with. You have some 
real worrying to do. 

He turned to her. “I haven’t 
been able to — ” 

“His name’s Prester.” She 
leaned close to the partition and 
whispered, “Oh, Roan, you saw 
me like that, in the pool. They 
hadn’t meant for you to see me 
at all. Oh, what you must think!" 

He said, just as softly, “I 
hadn’t let myself believe it.” 

“I know,” she said desperate- 
ly. “I’m surprised you even came 
here.” 

“What do you mean — Oh, the 
pool! Do you know, it never oc- 
curred to me until this minute 
that you were — that you’d be — 
oh, forget it, Val. I’m just glad 
you found him. Prester, hm? 
Nice-looking fellow.” 

Her face lit up like a second 
sun. “Roan — really? I’m not a 
— hussy?” 

“You’re grand and the only 
person I know in this whole 
sterile, starched world who’s 
managed to live a little! I’m glad, 
Val! You don’t know — you can’t 
— what I’ve been through. 
Enough to make a dozen dreams. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And it came like a dream — I 
mean parts and chunks or real- 
life things — things Granny was 
maundering about, things I’d 
seen, a girl I met once wrong- 
dialing — an accident, you little 
prude! I believed it was just a 
dream — I had to, I guess. I had 
to believe Flower and she told 
me it was.” Lord, he’d said the 
word right out loud in front of 
his sister! 

But she was quite composed, 
cheeks excitement-red, not dis- 
gusted-red, eyes bright and dis- 
tant. “She’s lovely, Roan, just 
beautiful. She loves you. I know .” 
“Think she does?” He grinned 
till it hurt. “Oh, Val, Val — the 
maplesugar kettle.” 

“Mmm — the oat-field!” 

“The big table and the sing- 
ing!” 

“Yes, and the children — all 
those children!” 

“What happened?” he cried. 
“How could such a thing hap- 
pen?” 

CHE whispered fervently, “We 
^ could both be crazy. Or the 
whole world could be coming 
apart and we slipped in and out 
through a crack into— or maybe 
it really was a dream, but we had 
it together. But I don’t care, it 
was beautiful and — and if you’d 
said I was a — because of — you’d 
have spoiled it and killed me, 
too. Is it all right then, Roan, is 



it really all right? Really?” 
“You’re sort of beautiful your- 
self. For a sister, that is.” 

“Oooh/” she squeaked, blush- 
ing and enormously pleased. 
Then, happily, “I’m glad I’m not 
you.” 

“Uh— why?” 

“How does it work, what makes 
it go, is it a dream, and, if not, 
what could it be? Be like me, 
Roan. It happened — for the rest 
of my life it has happened! But — 
I hope there’ll be more.” 

“If I find out how it works, 
what makes it go and so on, there 
will be more. So you just be glad 
I’m like me in that respect.” 

“If you found it, you — would- 
n’t keep me out?” 

“If I couldn’t take you,” he 
said warmly, “I wouldn’t go. 
Now do you feel better?” 

“I’m going to kiss you!” 

He roared with laughter at 
the very idea in a place like this 
and, under the stares this at- 
tracted, she cried, “Be quiet — 
thunderfeet!” At the phrase from 
Flower’s little song, his heart 
twisted. 

She peeped at his face and said, 
“I’m sorry, Roan.” 

“Don’t be,” he said hoarsely. 
“For that second, she was right 
here.” He put out his hands, made 
fists, stared at them, then got 
them out of sight again. Flower 
— well, he’d have plenty of time 
to find her after 1600. “Val . .”

“I didn’t know anyone could 
be so happy!” she said. “What, 
Roan?” 

“Nothing. Just that I really am 
late,” he said, abruptly changing 
his mind. No need to air his 
troubles to her now — the news 
services would take care of that 
about 1612. Meanwhile, let her 
stay happy. 

They walked back to the trans- 
plat. 

“Roan, let’s come here every 
day and talk about it. I don’t 
know a thing you did and you 
don’t know what I did. Like the 
time — ” 

“Sure I will, sure,” he said. 
“Take something pretty big to 
stop me.” 

She stopped dead. “There’s 
something the matter.” 

“Get on your 'plat. Every- 
thing’s fine. Hurry now.” 

She dialed and stepped up and 
was gone. He stood looking at the 
empty air, where her anxious 
face had been, until another pas- 
senger filled it. He hoped he 
hadn’t worried her. 

He walked slowly back to the 
bench and sat down, and that was 
where he had his big idea. 

HOEVER is that?” The 
thin old voice was edgy. 

“Me. Roan,” he said from the 
court. 

The top panel of a door slid 
back and the voice floated to him, 



gentle now, and firm. “You know 
you’re welcome here, son, but 
you also know you’re to call first. 
Just spin that dial and clear out 
of here for an hour. Then you 
can come and stay as long as 
you like.” 

“Petals to that. I haven’t got 
an hour. Come on out here or 
I’m coming in.” 

“Don’t you use that language 
on me, you leak-brained snipe, or 
I'll lift your hair with a blunt 
nailfile!” 

The instant she began to shout, 
he began to roar, “Decent or not, 
just get on out here. If you'd shut 
off your low-fidelity mouth for 
twelve lousy seconds, you'd stop 
wasting your own time!" 

They stopped yelling together 
and the silence was deafening. 
Suddenly, Granny laughed, “Boy, 
where’d you learn that type lan- 
guage?” 

“For years, I’ve been hearing 
you talk, Great Mam,” he said 
diffidently. “It only just now 
occurred to me that I never real- 
ly listened. And about being de- 
cent — if you’re comfortable, come 
as you are.” 

“Damfidon’t!” She came out 
of the room and kicked the door 
closed with a flip of her heel. She 
wore an immense wrapper of an 
agonizing blue and seemed to be 
barefooted. Her hair, instead of 
lying sleekly away from the cen- 
ter part in two controlled wings, 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



flew free like a May’s. Roan had 
one frozen moment, and then she 
tossed the hair back on one side 
with an angry twitch of her head. 
“Well?” she blazed. There seem- 
ed to be nothing left of the gentle 
talc-on-ivory quality in her voice. 

Slowly, he smiled. “Damfidon’t 
like you better the way you are.” 
She sniffed, but she was pleas- 
ed. “All you can do to keep your 
eyes from rolling out onto the 
carpet. Ah, well, you’ve found my 
secret. Reckon I’m old enough 
to have just one eccentricity?” 
she demanded challengingly. 

“You’ve lived long enough to 
earn your privileges.” 

“Come on in here,” she said, 
starting down the court. “Most 
folks don’t or can’t realize I’ve 
spent the least part of my life 
in that cone-in-cone getup. 
Everybody else around’s prac- 
tically born in it. I just don’t like 
it. Chest-padding the men so 
they won’t look different from 
women!” she snorted. “I wasn’t 
brought up that way.” She open- 
ed the manual door in the cor- 
ner. “Here we are.” 

TT was an odd-shaped room, 
an isoscles triangle. He had 
never seen it before. “What hap- 
pened to your voice, Granny? 
You feeling all right?” 

In the familiar wind-in-the- 
distance tones, *she said, “You 
mean you miss this little gasp?” 



Then, stridently, “Something I 
picked up for company. Had to. 
Nobody’d take me seriously when 
I talked natural. They cast me as 
a frail little pillar of respectabil- 
ity and, by the Lord, I was stuck 
with it. It’s hot in here.” 

He missed the hint, waited for 
her to sit down, and then joined 
her. “Know why I’m here?” 

She regarded him closely. 
“Sleeping well?” 

“That wasn’t a dream.” 

“No? What then?” 

“I came to find out what it 
was. Where it is.” 

She fluttered the lapel of the 
wrapper. “You got this part of 
my secret life out of me, but that 
don’t guarantee you all of it. 
What makes you so sure it 
wasn’t a dream?” 

“You just don’t go to bed 
healthy and sleep for two days! 
Besides, there’s Valerie. I saw 
her there, right at the very last 
second.” 

She grunted. “ ’Fraid of that. 
No one was sure." She laughed. 
“Must’ve been a picnic when you 
two got your heads together. You 
come here to kill me?” 

"What?” 

“Outraged brother and all 
that?” 

“Valerie’s happier than she’s 
ever been in her life and so much 
in love, she can’t see straight. 
I’m just as happy for her as she 
is for herself.”

“Well!" she smiled. “This 
changes things. So you want to 
take your sister and go live out 
your lives in a dreamland.” 

“It’s more than that,” he said. 
“I need one of your telekinesis 
operators. I mean now.” 

“The best I can do for you is a 
little girl who can knock down a 
balancing straight-edge at any 
distance under fifteen feet.” 

He made no attempt to con- 
ceal his scorn. 

She pursed her lips thought- 
fully. “How’d you mix me up in 
this, anyway?” 

“We’re wasting time,” he said. 
“But if you must know, it was 
your hints to me last time I was 
here — the transplat obsolete, peo- 
ple appearing in any room any- 
where, communication without 
phones. I’d already seen tele- 
kinesis twice, when you told me 
that. And since then . he 
shrugged. “You had to be in it. 
Maybe you’d like to tell me why 
I'm mixed up in it.” 

“Hadn’t planned to for a while. 
Maybe we’ll step up the schedule. 
Now what’s the all-fired rush?” 
“I have an appointment in — ” 
he checked — “less than two hours 
that is going to put me under the 
ground unless I can get help.” 

TTE told her, rapidly, about the 
lost time and his father’s 
threat. 

“You’re dead right,” she said 



after a moment. “He’s afraid of 
you. I don’t know why he should 
be that afraid. He’s just like his 
father, the potbellied old — ” She 
stopped, shocked, as a large hand 
closed over her wrist. 

“I can’t listen to that.” 

“All right,” she said with sur- 
prising swiftness. “I’m sorry. 
Given one of my TKs, what 
would you do?” 

He leaned forward, put his el- 
bows on his knees, bringing his 
gloved hands into plain sight. 

“Do? I’m going to take this 
wrinkle-free civilization and turn 
it out into the woods. I’m going to 
clutter up the Family Rooms 
with the family’s own children. 
I’m going to turn Stasis itself 
upside down and shake it till the 
blood runs into its head and it 
finds out how to sweat again.” 
Granny’s eyes brightened. 
“Why?” 

“I could tell you it was for the 
good of all the people — because 
you’re Great Mam and lived 
through it all and had a chance 
to think about things like that. 
But I’m not going to say any- 
thing like that to you. No— I’ll do 
it because I want to live that 
way myself, head of a family of 
hard-handed, barefoot, axe- 
swinging people who are glad to 
get up in the morning. 

“I thought of finding the 
dream -people again. I even 
thought of going out into the 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wilderness between cities and liv- 
ing that way myself. But if I did, 
I’d always be afraid that some 
day a resources survey crew 
might find me, scoop me up and 
bring me back. Stasis wouldn’t let 
people live like that, so let’s make 
Stasis live our way.” 

He took a deep breath. “Now 
Stasis is built around the trans- 
plat. There can’t ever be a bet- 
ter machine. But if I go in there 
today and claim I’ve spent years 
secretly developing one — if I get 
one of your people to start trans- 
mitting things all over his office 
and claim I have a new machine 
to do it with — why, the Private's 
got to listen. I’ll save my job and 
spot your people through and 
through the whole culture till it 
falls apart. And one day maybe 
I’ll be the Private at Walsh & 
Co. — and, Stasis, look out!” 

“You know,” she said. “I like 
you.” 

“Help me,” he said bluntly. 
“I’ll like you, too.” 

CHE rose and punched his arm 
^ with sharp knuckles. “I’ll have 
to think. You know, if you can 
fast-talk your way out of this, 
you’ll only stall things a little. 
The old — your father — wouldn’t 
buy any parlor tricks. He’d want 
to see that machine.” 

“Then let’s stall. Can you fix 
me up with a telekin — telekineti- 
cist? That what you call them?” 



“TK,” she said absently. “I’ve 
got something a heap better than 
any TK. How’d you like a sta- 
tionless transplat — a matter 
transmitter that will lift anything 
from anywhere to anywhere with- 
out centrals or depots?” 

“There’s no such thing, Gran- 
ny.” 

“Why do you say that?” 

“All my life I’ve been a trans- 
plat man, that’s why. There’s a 
limiting factor on matter trans- 
mission. It must have a planetary 
field; it must have a directing 
central; it must have platforms 
built of untransmissible material 
and — ” 

“Don’t tell me how a transplat 
works,” she snapped. “Suppose a 
machine was designed on totally 
different principles. A force- 
pump instead of a suction pump. 
Or an Archimedes screw.” 

“There isn’t any other prin- 
ciple! Don’t you think I know?" 

“I'll show you the damn ma- 
chine!” She marched to the 
angled wall of the little room and 
bumped a scuff -plate near the 
floor. The entire wall slid upward 
into the ceiling, swift and silent. 
Lights blazed. 

It was quite a laboratory. 
Much of its equipment he had 
thought existed only in factories. 
Most was incomprehensible to 
him. 

Granny walked briskly down 
an aisle and stopped at the far 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



47 



wall. Ranged against it was a 
glittering cluster of equipment 
beneath a desk-sized control 
panel. The desk surface seemed to 
be a vision screen, though it was 
hinged at the top. At the side, he 
saw what looked like manipulator 
controls of the kind used in radi- 
ation laboratories. 

“There’s a servo-robot this size 
on a hill about forty miles from 
here,” said Granny. 

She turned a switch, sat down 
over the screen and began to spin 
two control wheels. 

“Tell you what it does,” she 
said abstractedly as she worked, 
“though this ain’t really the way 
it does it. Plot a straight line out 
from this machine and a line from 
the other. Where they intersect, 
that’s your transmission point. 
Now draw two more lines from 
the equipment and where they 
cross, that’s the arrival point. 
When they’re set up, you haul on 
this sniwy and what was here 
is now there. The stuff doesn’t 
travel any more than it does with 
a transplat. It ceases to exist at 
one point and conservation of 
matter makes it appear at an- 
other. 

“But you’ve created just the 
strain in space which makes it 
show up.” 

“Show me.” 

“All right. Call it.” 

“My old wallet. Top drawer, 
left side in the office. Drawer’s 



locked, by the way,” he said. 

“What’s the matrix?” 

TIE reeled off the address co- 
ordinates. She tapped them 
on a keyboard and bent over 
the screen. It showed a Stasis 
unit. She spun a wheel and the 
buildings rushed closer. Her hand 
dropped back to a vernier and 
the view slowed, seemed to press 
through the roof and hover over 
a desk. 

“Right?” 

“Go on,” he said. “Pretty fair 
spy-ray you have there.” 

“You don’t know!” She reach- 
ed and from a speaker came the 
quiet bustle of the office. She 
went back to the controls and the 
view sank into the desktop. Sud- 
denly, the contents of the drawer 
were there. With the manipula- 
tors, she deftly hooked the wal- 
let, raised it a fraction. Then the 
scene disappeared as she shifted 
to another set of controls. 

“Receiver location,” she mur- 
mured. The garbled picture clear- 
ed, became a mass of girders and 
then a bird’s-eye view of the 
room they stood in, so clear that 
Roan looked up with a start. 
He could see nothing. “Stick out 
your stupid hand,” said Granny. 

He obeyed and she brought the 
scene down to it until its image 
hung in the center of the picture. 
Roan wiggled his fingers. Granny 
cut back to the other view, check-

ed it, then threw over the “sniv- 
vy” she had shown him earlier. 

The wallet dropped into his 
hand. 

She switched off, turned and 
looked up at him. “Well?” 

He said, “Why play around 
like this?” 

"What do you mean?” 

“This thing doesn’t do what 
you say it does. I got the wallet, 
sure, but not with that thing.” 
“Do tell. All right, how did 
you get the wallet?” 

He considered the instrument 
carefully. “It’s a sort of ampli- 
fier — yes, and range-finder, too. 
It just gets a fix for your TK 
man. Right?” 

“You really think I’ve got a 
high-powered psychic hiding 
around here who does the work 
after I get to it with the finder?” 
“ You're the TK!” 

She slumped resignedly at the 
controls. “If you can’t lick ’em, 
join ’em. Old Roman saying. If 
that’s what you say it is, boy, 
then that’s what it is.” 

“Why didn’t you say so in the 
first place?” he grumbled, look- 
ing at his watch. “So now what 
do we do?” 

“Wait a minute — I’ve got to 
get used to something.” She hung 
over the console and then glanced 
up brightly. “I’ll break out the 
pilot model. You can’t tote this 
thing under your arm.” 

She went to a storage wall and 



dragged out a bin. In it was a 
long box. Roan helped her open 
it and lift out the spindly collec- 
tion of coils and bars, setting it 
on a bench. 

“I’ll check you through this.” 
She flung off her wrapper and ad- 
vanced on the machine. “Just 
turn it on its side for me,” she 
said. “What are you gawping at? 
Oh!” She looked down at her 
shorts and halter, and laughed. 
“I told you it was too hot in 
here.” 

IT was not that age had left 
no marks on her compact 
body, but certainly not two cen- 
turies’ worth. Holding a light- 
duty soldering iron near her 
cheek, she slapped herself on the 
bare midriff. 

“One thing you might keep in 
mind about women as you get 
to know ’em, Roany — the parts 
that the decent people expose are 
exactly the ones that get old first. 
This face of mine was gone at 75, 
but the tummy’s good for an- 
other hundred yet.” She bent 
over the device. “Maybe it’s bet- 
ter that way, maybe not — who's 
to say? Hand me the millivolt- 
meter there.” 

After a time, her work with the 
machine took precedence over 
everything else in Roan’s cosmos. 
“You sure can get around in 
there,” he said, awed, as he held 
the light for her.

“Think so?” she grunted, and 
went on working steadily. 

VIII 

A T 1451, Roan Walsh arrived 
at the Walsh Building. His 
head spun with its lopsided 
weight of advice, technical data 
and strategy. His arrival was in 
the warehouse, not in the office, 
for he brought a long wooden 
box on casters. He pushed the box 
himself up the long corridor to 
the office wing. 

“Oh, Roan Walsh, can I help?” 
“No, Corsonmay. Wait — Yes, 
come in.” He put his hands on 
the end of the box and nodded at 
the dithering secretary. “Grab 
hold here.” 

She came close, tittered and 
let the tips of her gloves show for 
an instant before she slipped 
them clumsily under the end of 
the box. 

Not that end up, you addle- 
head. 

Roan yelped and let go. Cor- 
sonmay, now bearing most of the 
not inconsiderable weight, began 
to mew rapidly. Roan, sitting flat 
on the floor, gasped, “Who said 
that?” 

“Ewp!" squeaked Corsonmay. 
“It’s heavy!” 

“Let it down. My God, Cor- 
sonmay, you’re as strong as a 
horse!” 

“That’s the nicest thing you 



ever said to me,” she beamed 
without sarcasm. 

He turned to her, found him- 
self face to face with her withered 
ardency. “What did you say 
about lifting up the wrong end, 
Corsonmay?” 

“I didn’t say anything.” 

/ did. 

“Byemay,” he said, and fore- 
stalling her, added, “Really — 
nothing more. Byemay.” 

She left and he whirled, hunt- 
ing futilely in midair. “Granny! 
Where are you?” 

Briefly, just at eye-level, the 
business end of a needle-focus 
audio beam projector appeared. 
Roan patted it happily and it 
disappeared. Bless her, she’d be 
watching everything through her 
big machine, her audio aimed for 
his inner ear every second. 

At 1559.5, the ceiling said, 
“Roan Walsh, you may step in 
now.” 

“Coming, Private.” He all but 
started at the sound of his own 
voice. How was it that, though 
he seemed increasingly able to 
cope with anyone or anything, 
his father’s voice still turned him 
to mush? 

But that could wait. He 
stepped just inside the room. 

“Come, come — stand close. I 
intend to do one of several things, 
but biting is not one of them.” 
Roan stayed where he was. 
“May I have the Private’s per- 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



51 



mission to bring a piece of equip- 
ment in?” 

"You have my permission to 
bring those cards in, revised or 
not. Nothing more.” 

“The Private deprives me of 
the use of evidence he himself 
assigned me to bring,” Roan said 
stiffly. 

“Do I now?” The beard, its 
lower end invisible under the 
privacy hood, was pulled 
thoughtfully. “Very well. But I 
should warn you — you have no 
leeway, young man. None!” 

R OAN wheeled the box through 
the doorway. He was shaking 
with apprehension, but Granny’s 
voice pleaded inaudibly, Trust 
me. 

Even in front of his father, he 
nearly smiled. He locked the cas- 
ters and, with a tremendous 
effort, heaved the box up on end. 
The right end, this time. 

“What the devil’s that?" de- 
manded the beard. 

“My evidence, Private.” Out- 
wardly calm, inwardly aquiver, 
he drew out the top section of 
the box with its two knobs and 
their two sets of horns. Each horn 
was hollow and had a light in- 
side. Roan turned them on. 

“I asked you a question,” rum- 
bled the Private. 

“Your patience,” Roan re- 
sponded. 

What patience? Granny’s 



chuckle did more good for Roan 
than a week’s delay. 

“Ready now, Private. May I 
have the use of some small object 
— your stylus, perhaps, or a small 
book?” 

“You have taken my money 
and you are taking my time. Is 
it now your intention to take 
my property?” 

Whyncha spit in his eye? 

Roan threw up a glance of 
such extreme annoyance that the 
inaudible voice apologized. 

Sorry. It's just that I'm on 
your side, honey. 

Honey! He had tasted his very 
first honey in his “dream.” That 
was a nice thing to call someone. 
He wondered if anyone had ever 
thought of it before. To the 
Private, he said, “If I use my 
own property, there could be 
some suspicion of previous prep- 
aration.” 

“I suspect the previous prep- 
aration with which you are clut- 
tering up my office already,” 
growled the old man. “Here’s 
the old paperweight. It dates 
from the time when buildings 
had sliding panels opening to the 
outside air. If anything happens 
to it — ” 

“It will do,” said Roan levelly, 
taking it without thanks. The 
Private’s eyebrow ridges moved 
briefly. “Would you kindly point 
out a spot on the floor?” 

With an expression of saintly 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



53 



patience, the Private drew out his 
stylus and threw it. It fell near 
the far wall. Roan placed the 
paperweight near the point of the 
stylus, on the carpet. 

“And one more indulgence. A 
point on your desk — somewhere 
with enough area to support that 
paperweight.” 

“Damn it, no! Go get those 
cards and we’ll settle the matter 
in hand. I fail to see — ” 

Don't let him rant. Find your 
own spot and ask him if it suits 
him. 

T IKE a man in a hailstorm, 
Roan advanced through the 
booming and shrieking syllables 
and pointed. 

“Will this do?” he shouted, just 
loud enough to be heard over 
the storm. 

The Private stopped just then 
and Roan’s voice was like an air- 
foil crashing the sound barrier. 
Both men recoiled violently; to 
his own astonishment, Roan 
found that he recovered first. The 
old man was still sunk deep in 
his chair, the base of the beard 
quivering. In Roan’s ear, Granny 
cackled. 

Roan grasped the two horns 
protruding from one of the 
spheres on his machine and turn- 
ed them so that the beam from 
each rested on the center of the 
paperweight. 

“The production model would 



have other means of aiming,” he 
explained as he worked. “This is 
for demonstration only.” The 
other twp beams were aimed at 
the indicated spot on the desk. 
“Ready now, Private.” 

“For what?” snarled the Priv- 
ate, then grunted as if he had 
swallowed a triple ration of 
roughage, for when Roan touched 
the control, there was a soft click 
and the paperweight appeared on 
the desk, exactly in the small 
pool of light from the beams. 
He put out a hand, hesitated, 
dropped back in his chair. 
’’Again.” 

Roan threw the lever the other 
way. The paperweight lay quiet- 
ly on the carpet. “For years, I 
have used every available minute 
on the research needed for this 
device and in building it. If the 
Private feels that the machine 
is of no use to this firm and the 
industry, that the time spent on 
it was wasted or stolen, then I 
shall be satisfied with his pre- 
viously suggested — ” 

“Now come off it, son,” said 
the beard. He rose and ap- 
proached Roan, but kept his eyes 
glued on the machine in fascina- 
tion. “You know the old man was 
just trying to throw a scare into 
you.” 

Got ’ im ! 

“Could a large model be built?” 
“Larger than a transplat,” 
Roan said. 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Have you built any larger 
than this?” 

Tell him yes! 

“Yes, Private.” 

Slowly the Private’s eyes left 
the machine and traveled to 
Roan’s face. Roan would have 
liked to retreat, but his back was 
against the wooden case. 

Watch out ! 

“You feel this could be better 
than the transplat?” 

Yes. Tell ’ im yes — even if it 
hurts, tell im! 

Roan found he could not speak. 
He tremblingly nodded his head. 

“Hmm.” The Private walked 
around the machine and back, 
though there was nothing to be 
seen. “Tell me,” he said gently, 
“is this machine built on the 
same principle as the transplat?” 

S WEAT broke out on Roan’s 
brow. He wished he could 
wipe it off, but to raise his glove 
would have been a rudeness. He 
let it trickle. 

“No,” he whispered. 

“You are telling me that this 
is a new kind of machine, better 
than the transplat!” When Roan 
neither moved nor spoke, the 
Private suddenly shouted, “Liar!” 
Roan, white, dry-mouthed, 
with a great effort brought his 
eyes up to meet those of the 
livid Private. “A transplat can’t 
do that,” he said, nodding to the 
paperweight. 

GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



“You’ve got to be lying! If 
there was such a machine as this, 
you couldn’t build it. You 
couldn’t even conceive it! Where 
did you get it?” 

Say you built it — quick! 

“I built it,” Roan breathed. 

“I can’t understand it,” mum- 
bled the Private. 

Roan had never seen him so 
distressed and his curiosity got 
the better of his own tension. 
“What is it that you want me to 
say, Private?” 

The Private swung around, 
face to face with his son. “You’re 
holding something back. What is 
it?” 

This is it! Now hold tight, 
honey. Tell him it works by PK. 

Roan shook his head and set 
his lips, and the Private roared at 
him. “Are you refusing to answer 
me?” 

Tell him, tell him about the 
PK. Tell him! 

Roan had never felt so tom 
apart. There had to be more to 
this than he knew about. What 
was pushing him? What tied his 
tongue, knotted his stomach, 
swelled his throat? 

Trust me, Roan. Trust me, no 
matter what. 

TT broke him. He choked out, 
“This is only a direction- 
finder. It works by psychokinetic 
energy.” 

“By what? What?” The Priv- 
55 



ate fairly bounced with eagerness. 
“It’s called PK. Mental power.” 
“Then it really isn’t a machine 
at all!” 

“Well — yes, you might say so. 
That’s my theory, anyway.” And 
where were the tied tongue, the 
aching throat? Gone! 

“And you believe in that psy- 
cho-stuff?” 

Roan found himself smiling. 
“It works.” 

“Why were you hiding it?’ 
“Would you have believed in 
such a thing, Private?” 

“I confess I wouldn’t.” 

“Well, then — I wanted to get it 
finished and tested, that’s all.” 
“Then what?” 

Give it to him. I mean it — give 
it to him! 

“Why, it’s yours. Ours. The 
company’s. What else?” 

The dry sound was the slow 
rubbing of gloved hands together. 
The other, which only Roan 
heard, was Granny’s acid chuckle. 
And he didn't even ask where the 
psychic operator was — notice? 
And he never will. 

The Private said, “Would you 
like to work with the Develop- 
ment Department on the thing?” 
Sure, honey. I’ll never let you 
down. 

“Fine,” Roan said. 

“You’ll never know — you can’t 
know what this really means,” 
said the Private. For a moment, 
Roan was sure he was, going to 



clap him on the shoulder or some 
such unthinkable thing. “I can 
own up to a mistake. You 
should’ve been on the nuts-and- 
bolts end right from the start. 
Instead, I had you chasing in- 
ventories and consignments. Well, 
you’ve shown up the old man. 
From now on, your time’s your 
own. You just work on anything 
around here that amuses you.” 

“I couldn’t do that!” 

Yes, by God, you could! 
snapped the voice in his ear. And 
while he’s soft, hit him again. 
Get your own home. 

His own home! With one of 
those PK machines, he could go 
anywhere, anytime. He could take 
Val — and find Flower again!

I T was warm and windy and 
very dark. The village was 
asleep and only a handful of peo- 
ple sat around the great trestle 
table in the clearing. The stars 
watched them and the night-birds 
called. 

“To get grim about it,” said 
the old lady in a voice a good 
deal less than grim, “breaking up 
a culture isn’t something you can 
do on an afternoon off. You’ve 
got to know where it’s been and 
where it is, before you know 
where it’s going. That takes a 
good deal of time. Then you have 
to decide how much it needs

changing and, after that, whether 
or not you were right when you 
decided. Then it’s a good idea 
to know for sure — but for sure — 
that you don’t push it so far, it 
flops over some other gruesome 
way.” 

"But I was right all the same, 
wasn’t I?” Roan insisted. 

"Bless you, yes. You don’t 
know how right.” 

"Then tell me.” 

"Some of it’ll hurt.” 

"Don’t hurt him,” said Flower, 
half -seriously. Roan took her 
hand in the dark, feeling, as 
always, the indescribable flood 
within him brought by the simple 
touch of living flesh. 

"Have to, honey,” said Granny. 
"Blisters’ll hurt him too, and 
his joints will ache at plowin’ 
time, but in the long run he’ll 
be all the better for it. Who’s 
there?” she called. 

A voice from the darkness an- 
swered, deep and happy, "Me, 
Granny. Prester.” 

"Hi, Granny,” said Val. They 
came into the dim, warm glow of 
the hurricane lamp guttering on 
the table. Val was wearing a very 
short sleeveless tunic, which look- 
ed as if a spider had spun it. 
She and Prester moved arm in 
arm like a single being. Looking 
at her face, Roan felt dazzled. 
He squeezed Flower’s hand and 
found her smiling. 

"Sit down, kids. I want you to 



hear this, too. Roan, would you 
do something for me — something 
hard?” 

"What is it?” 

"Promise to shut up until I’ve 
finished, no matter what?” 
“That’s not hard.” 

“No, huh? All right, Flower, 
tell us all just exactly what psi 
powers you have.” 

Roan closed his eyes in de- 
light, picturing again Flower’s 
appearance in his cubicle, her 
birdlike flitting about the gateway 
during his dream, the cup she 
had drawn out of thin air for him. 
She said, “None that I know of, 
Granny.” 

“What!” he exploded. 

G RANNY snapped, "You have 
promised to shut up!” To 
Flower, she went on, “And who’s 
got the most psi potential in the 
place, far as we know?” 

"Annie,” said Flower. 

"The fifteen-year-old I told 
you about,” Granny explained to 
Roan. "The one who can knock 
over a straight-edge. Shut up! 
Let me finish!” 

With a great effort, he sub- 
sided. 

“In a way, we’ve lied to you,” 
Baid Granny, “and, in a way, we 
haven’t. I once told you some of 
what I’ve been thinking of — the 
new race of people that has to 
be along some day, if we let it — 
the next step up. I believe in

them, Roan; call that a dream if 
you like. And when you had your 
dream those two days, we made 
the dream come true for a little 
while. We worked that thing out 
like a play — I had you in the 
frame of that new machine of 
mine all the time. 

“It is a new machine, Roan, 
built on a new principle that the 
transplat boys never thought of. 
It’s just what I told you it was — 
a stationless matter transmitter — 
no central, no depots, no plat- 
forms. I used it on every psi 
incident you witnessed in those 
two days. Believe me?” 

“No!” 

“Val?” 

“I’d like to,” she said diffident- 
ly. “But I’ve always thought — ” 
“There’s no use being tactful 
about this,” said Granny. “For 
the rest of your life, this is going 
to bother you, Roan, Val — and, 
later, a lot of other people we’ll 
bring in. You’ll rationalize it or 
you won’t, but you’ll never be- 
lieve I have a new kind of ma- 
chine. Shut up. Roan! 

“You two and the rest of your 
generation are the first group to 
get really efficient cr&che condi- 
tioning. You don’t remember it, 
but ever since you were suckling 
babes, you’ve been forced into 
one or two basic convictions. 
Maybe we’ll find a way to pry 
’em loose from you. One of these 
convictions is that the transplat 



is the absolute peak of human 
technology — that there’s only one 
way to make ’em and that there 
are only certain things they can 
do. 

“You got it more than Val did, 
Roan, because you males in the 
transplat families were the ones 
who might be expected to de- 
velop such a machine. That’s 
why, when this new one was 
built, women built it. Don’t fight 
so, son! We have it, whether you 
believe it or not. We always will 
have it from now on. I’m sorry — 
it hurts you even to hear about 
it and I know what you went 
through when you had to sell it 
to your father. You damn near 
choked to death!” 

R OAN breathed heavily, but 
did not speak. Flower put her 
arm across his shoulders. 

“We had to do it to you, boy, 
we had to — you’ll see why,” said 
Granny, her old face pinched with 
worry and tenderness. “I’m com- 
ing to that part of it. Like I 
said, you don’t break up a cul- 
ture just all at once, boom. I 
wanted to change it, not wreck it. 
Stasis is the end product of a lot 
of history. Human beings had 
clobbered themselves up so much 
for so long, they developed what 
you might call a racial phobia 
against insecurity When they 
finally got the chance — the trans- 
plat — they locked themselves up 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tight with it. That isn’t what the 
transplat was for, originally. It 
was supposed to disperse human- 
ity over the globe again, after 
centuries of huddling. Hah! 

“About the time they started 
deep conditioning in the cr&ches, 
walling each defenseless new gen- 
eration off from new thoughts, 
new places, new ways of life, a 
few of us started to fear for hu- 
manity. Stasis was the first hu- 
man culture to try to make new 
ideas impossible. I think it might 
have been humanity’s first eternal 
culture. I really do. But I think 
it would also have been human- 
ity’s worst one. 

“So along came Roan — the first 
of the deep-conditioned transplat 
executives, incapable of believing 
the service could be improved. 
There were — are — plenty more in 
other industries and we’re going 
after ’em now, but transplat is 
the keystone. Roan, believe it or 
not, you were a menace. You 
had to be stopped. We couldn’t 
have you heading the firm with- 
out introducing the new machine, 
yet if it weren’t introduced in 
your generation, it never would. 

“Your father is the last weak 
link, the last with the kind of 
imperfect conditioning that would 
let him even consider an innova- 
tion — remember your suggestion 
for eliminating freight operators? 
Only he would be unconditioned 
just enough to put our new ma- 



chine into Development before 
realizing that, once in use, every 
cubicle in the whole human struc- 
ture will suddenly be open to 
the sky. And it’s all right — he 
can be trusted with it, because 
his ‘decency’ won’t let him abuse 
privacy. We'll take care of that 
side of it!” 

“I wish you wouldn’t talk like 
that about him,” said Roan mis- 
erably. 

“I’m sorry, boy. Does it do any 
good to tell you that subservience 
and blind respect for your father 
are conditioned, too? I wish I 
could help you — you’ll have that 
particular sore toe tramped on all 
your life. Anyway, enter Roan, 
just when we’ve perfected the 
new machine. There would have 
been no problem if we could have 
broken your conditioning against 
it, but the only alternatives seem- 
ed to be — either you’d see the 
machine operate and think you 
had lost your sanity, or you’d 
use your position in the firm to 
eliminate all trace of it.” 

TIE objected, “But you were 
wrong both ways.” 

“That’s because we discovered 
that the conditioning against any 
new transplat was against any 
new machine — any new device /’ 
Granny replied. “They’d never 
thought of matter transmission 
by a method winch was in no 
way a device! 



GRANNY WON'T KNIT 



59 



“Can you see now why your 
father was so upset when he was 
faced with you and your pilot 
model? One of the props of his 
decent little universe .was that the 
conditioning would stick — that of 
all people on Earth, you’d be 
the last to even think of a new 
machine, let alone build one. And 
when at last you came out with 
that gobbledegook about psychic 
power, he recognized the ration- 
alization for what it was and felt 
safe again. Stasis was secure. 

“I don’t mind telling you that 
you made us jump the gun a bit. 
Our initial plan was to recruit 
carefully, just the way we did 
you. Dreams — unexpected and 
high-powered appeals to every- 
thing humanity has that Stasis is 
crushing. Then when there were 
enough of us wilderness people, 
maybe the gates would open. But 
ultimately we’d win — we have all 
nature and God Himself on our 
side. 

“But you came along — what a 
candidate! You responded right 
down the line — so much so that, 
if we’d given you your head, 
you’d have dynamited Stasis and 
probably yourself and us along 
with it! And you took to that 
psi idea the way you took to 
the steak we planted in your 
nutrient that day, testing for food 
preference before the dream se- 
quence. All of a sudden, you 
wanted to plant our machine 



spang in the middle of Stasis! It 
was chancy, but — well, you’ve 
seen what happened.’’ 

“Can I talk now?’’ Roan asked 
uncomfortably. 

“Sure, boy.” 

“I’m not going to argue with 
you about the new machine — 
how it works, I mean. All you’ve 
done is give Stasis a more effi- 
cient machine. You can inter- 
fere with the new network, but 
you could do that anyway with 
the one you already had. So 
what’s the big advantage?” 

Granny chuckled. From a side 
pocket, she dug a white object 
and tossed it across the table. 
It left a powdery spoor as it 
rolled. “Know what that is?” 
“Chalk?” asked Val. 

“No, it isn’t,” Roan said. “It’s 
Lunar pumice. I’ve seen a lot of 
that stuff.” 

“Well, you’ll have to take my 
word for it,” said Granny, 
“though I’ll demonstrate any 
time you say — but I got that at 
1430 this very afternoon — off the 
Moon, using only the machine 
you saw in the lab.” 

“Off the Moon!” 

“Yup. That’s the advantage of 
the new machine. The transplat 
operates inside a spherical grav- 
itic field, canceling matter at cer- 
tain points and recreating it at 
others — a closed system. But the 
new machine operates on para- 
gravitic lines — straight lines of 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sub-spatial force which stretch 
from every mass in the Universe 
to every other. Mass canceled 
at one point on the line recurs at 
another point. Like the transplat, 
the new machine takes no time to 
cross any distance, because it 
doesn’t actually cover distance. 

“The range seems to be infinite 
— there’s a limitation on range- 
finding, but it’s a matter only of 
the distance between the two 
parts of the machine. I got the 
Moon easily with a forty-mile 
baseline. Put me a robot on the 
Moon and I can reach Mars. Set 
up a baseline between here and 
Mars and I can spit on Alpha 
Centauri. In other words, an open 
system.” 

f’T'HEY were silent as Roan 
-*• raised his eyes and, for a 
dazzling moment, visualized the 
stars supporting a blazing net- 
work of lines stretching from each 
planet, each star, to all the others 
— a net that pulsed with the 
presence of a humanity unthink- 
ably vast. 

Prester murmured, “Anybody 
want to buy a good spaceship?” 

“Why did you do it?” whis- 
pered Val, ever so softly, as if 
she were in a cathedral. 

“You mean why couldn’t I 
mind my own business and let 
the world happily dry up and 
blow away?” Granny chuckled. 
“I guess because I’ve always 



been too busy to sit still. No, I 
take that back. Say I did it be- 
cause of my conscience.” 
“Conscience?” 

“It was Granny who built the 
first transplat,” Flower explained. 

“And you were telling her what 
could and couldn’t be done, 
Roan!” gasped Val. 

“I still say — ” he objected in 
irritation, and then he began to 
laugh. “I once took a politeness- 
present to Granny. Knitting. 
Something for the old folk to do 
while they watch the Sun sink.” 
They all laughed and Flower 
said, “Granny won’t knit.” 

“Not for a while yet,” Granny 
said, and grinned up at the sky.

well paid for it — in any coin. 

That’s what I told Krasnow. 
And he wasn’t after peanuts. 
“I’ll do it,” I said, “if you’ll make 
it worth my while.” 

“I’d hardly expect you to do 
it for nothing,” he replied re- 
proachfully. “How much do you 
want?” 

I told him. The amount shook 
him up, but only briefly. 



BACK TO JULIE 



63 



“Okay,” he said grudgingly. “I 
suppose I’ll have to give it to you. 
But the stuff had better be good.” 
“Oh, it is,” I assured him. 
“And you don’t have to be afraid, 
because I couldn’t possibly skip 
with the loot, i’ll have to travel 
naked. I can’t get there with so 
much as a sandal on one foot or a 
filling in a single tooth. Fortunate- 
ly, my teeth are perfect.” 

Sweat poured off Krasnow’s 
florid face as he worked the com- 
bination of his office safe. His fat 
jowls quivered unhappily around 
his cigar while he counted out the 
bills. Ten per cent was cash in ad- 
vance, and the rest went into a 
bank account in my name. I paid 
off a batch of bills, then stripped 
and did my off-to-Buffalo. 

“TTONEST” John Krasnow was 
a crooked District Attorney 
who wanted to be Governor and 
then President. He had the Ma- 
chine, but he didn’t have the 
People. And, because he needed 
the People, he needed me. I had 
been to this other dimension — the 
one on the farthest branch of the 
time-tree — and I could give him 
what he wanted. 

Krasnow found out about it 
after I was hauled up in front 
of him on a check-kiting charge. 
I’d had something of a reputa- 
tion before I got into difficulties 
and, in trying to live up to the 
reputation, I had done some plain 



and fancy financing. Nothing that 
fifteen to twenty grand wouldn’t 
have fixed — but while I scroung- 
ed around, trying to get cash, I 
kited a few checks. They pyra- 
mided me right into the D.A.’s 
office, where Krasnow was prop- 
erly sympathetic. 

“How,” he asked, “could a man 
of your standing in the scientific 
world stoop so low?” It developed 
into quite a lecture and, even 
coming from Krasnow, it made 
me feel pretty low. 

So I began explaining. I told 
him where I was born, and where 
I went to school, and where I 
had taken my sabbaticals — in- 
cluding this other dimension. 
And Krasnow believed me. I 
can’t account for it, except pos- 
sibly because he knew he was a 
crook and knew I wasn’t one — 
exactly. Anyway, he believed me, 
and we made the deal and I did 
the side-shuffle, as agreed. 

The journey to that other di- 
mension is not a pleasant one. 
It does disturbing things to the 
stomach, and you see everything 
thin and elongated, as if you’re 
sitting too far to the side in a 
movie theater. 

I got there, however, and wait- 
ed for the hiccups to subside. 
Hiccupi lateral i, I had called 
them when I considered writing 
an article for the Medical Journal 
after my first trip. With the hic- 
cupi gone, I stole some clothing — 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



which was one of the riskiest parts 
of the program — and waited for 
morning. I didn’t have any 
money, of course, so I had to 
hitchhike into town. 

I could have stolen myself a 
better fit, but people aren’t 
clothes-conscious in that dimen- 
sion. They’re more interested in 
what you are and what you can 
do. The driver of the car that 
gave me a lift asked, “And what 
is your field of endeavor?” 

I told him, “I am able to elimi- 
nate the long wait in ivory pro- 
duction by accelerating the 
growth cycle of elephants.” 

He was deeply impressed and 
tipped me handsomely. I was less 
impressed with his talent for 
growing cobless corn, and there- 
fore had to return only a small 
part of the sum he gave me. 

The world of this dimension 
had developed some remarkable 
parallels to Earth. I mean our 
Earth, which falls into what I 
have designated Timeline One 
Point One, since it’s the Earth 
with which I am most familiar. 
Every other world that has a lan- 
guage calls itself Earth, too. I 
had to visit briefly hundreds 
of the lateral worlds, hovering 
over primordial swamps, limitless 
oceans, insect kingdoms and ra- 
dioactive planetoids, before I 
found the one that was truly 
parallel. 

It existed in Timeline Seven- 



teen Point Zero Eight, and it had 
refrigerators, platinum blondes, 
automobiles, airplanes, apple pie, 
tabloids, television, scotch and 
soda — just about everything we 
think makes life worthwhile. But 
it had its little differences, which 
was only to be expected in a 
timeline where the bionomics 
could create a new world each 
time someone changed his mind. 

Thus, the cobless-corn man was 
driving what looked to me like 
a Chevrolet, but which was a 
Morton in his world. He let me 
off near a downtown restaurant 
where, thanks to our little ex- 
change of talent talk, I had 
enough money for breakfast. It 
was considered unethical to swap 
talent talk outside the limits of 
certain rigidly defined groups, so 
I didn’t try to out-impress the 
waitress. 

¥7ED, and filling my stolen 
clothes a bit better, I walked 
to the recorder’s office and spent 
the rest of the morning looking 
up old documents. There was 
nothing there for Krasnow, as I 
had expected. But for me there 
was a very pretty file clerk. 
Talking to her, I verified my im- 
pression that human instincts and 
relationships were much the same 
in this dimension as in my own — 
except in the one basic respect 
that interested Krasnow, of 
course. 



BACK TO JULIE 



65 



The file clerk and I lunched to- 
gether and then I spent the after- 
noon in the library. But I didn’t 
find anything there, either, and 
then I had dinner with her. She 
said her name was Julie. I told 
her mine was Heck, for Hector, 
which it is. She thought this was 
"awfully cute” and we got along 
fine. 

Julie had a delightful apart- 
ment and a matching sense of 
hospitality. The following day, 
when she went to work, I stayed 
home and washed the dishes and 
made the bed and used the tele- 
phone. 

I ran up quite a bill with my 
long-distance calls, but I found 
out what I needed to know. I 
impressed a lot of people with my 
elephant story and pretended to 
be impressed hardly at all with 
what they told me they did — al- 
though often I was, very much. 

The trouble with these people 
is that they no longer know how 
to lie, if that can be listed as 
trouble. I don’t think it can. 
Neither did Krasnow, obviously. 
He’d never have sent me off on 
my expensive side-trip if he had. 

Of course, Krasnow looked at 
it objectively. What he wanted 
from Timeline Seventeen Point 
Zero Eight was not for himself. 
It was for everybody else. He 
wanted the formula for the truth 
gas these people had developed 
long ago and loosed upon their 




world to put a stop to wars. 

They had been in a bad way, 
although no worse than the sort 
of problem we were up against. 
Their trans-ocean squabbles and 
power politics seemed to have 
settled into a pattern of a war 
or two per generation. Just like 
us. Hence, the man who in- 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




vented the truth gas became a 
global hero, after a certain 
amount of cynicism and skep- 
ticism. All the doubts vanished, 
naturally, once the gas got to 
working. And so did war. 

You can’t do much plotting and 
scheming if, every time you open 
your mouth to tell a lie, you 



stammer, sweat, turn red and 
gasp for breath. It’s a dead give- 
away. Nobody tries it more than 
once. 

One or two men had tried to 
nullify the gas or work out a 
local antidote, either as a pure 
research project or through 
power-madness. But, because 



BACK TO JULIE 



67 



they had had to state their pur- 
poses as soon as they thought of 
them, they were put away. Neat. 
Very neat. 

What I wanted was the formula 
for the truth gas. Its location 
wasn’t exactly a secret in this 
land of complete candor, but it 
wasn’t writ large on any wall 
for all to see, either. They kept 
it in their capital — located about 
where our Omaha is— on file 
among the Vital Statistics. 

I took a super jet out there. 

¥ HAD no trouble posing as a 
historian entitled to the facts. 
The gas didn’t work on me, you 
see, because it was adjusted to the 
physiology of that timeline. 
There was just enough difference 
between us for it not to make me 
stick to the truth. 

“We’ll write out the formula 
for you,” I was told obligingly. 
“But you’ll have to sign the 
usual statement.” 

“Of course,” I said. “Which one 
is that?” 

“The one that says you won’t 
publish it, and will destroy your 
copy when it has served your 
research purpose, without letting 
anyone else see it.” 

“Oh, that statement,” I said. 

I signed freely, told my ele- 
phant story and departed in an 
aura of good will. 

The jet got me back that same 
evening. Julie fixed me up a 



snack, and we discussed how 
pretty she was and how nice I 
was. 

I had everything Krasnow 
wanted now. I felt pretty good 
about it, because there was no- 
body else who could have done 
the job for him, and because it 
wasn’t spying, really. Earth One 
Point One on the Timeline is 
world enough for Krasnow, I’m 
sure. Besides, dimensions don’t 
have wars with one another. Too 
many things can go wrong. 

Julie was lovely and I hated to 
leave the next morning, but it 
was my job. I told her, “I’m 
afraid I have to leave town for a 
bit, dear, but I’ll be back very 
soon. Business, you know.” 

Being a Seventeen Point Zero 
Eight girl, Julie had no reason 
to doubt me. “Make it very soon,” 
she whispered, her lips close to 
my ear. 

So I came back, and now Kras- 
now has what he wants. He’s de- 
lighted, as he should be. I’ve 
made up the gas for him and ad- 
justed the formula so that it will 
work on people of our timeline. 
It’s high-power stuff and a little 
will go a long way. I also made 
up an antidote for him. This was 
easy, since I could work on it 
without feeling any compulsion 
to tell everybody what I was 
doing and why. 

Krasnow plans to release the 
truth gas just before the state 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



convention. He’ll be nominated, 
of course, and after November 
he’ll be Governor. With everyone 
else compelled to tell the truth, 
it should be a cinch for him. He’s 
a patient man. Honest John 
Krasnow is, and he’s willing to 
wait four years for the Presidency. 

I ought to be happy too. With 
the money Krasnow gave me, 
I’ve been living in the style to 
which I’ve always wanted to be 
accustomed. He has offered me a 
place on his staff and, somewhat 
superfluously, the use of his anti- 
dote. Naturally, the reason he 
was so magnanimous was that he 
doesn’t want anyone else around 
who knows his gimmick and 
might have to tell the truth about 
it. 

But I have had enough of this 
dimension now — now that Kras- 
now has what I promised him. 
He’s going to use it tomorrow. 
And if I know Honest John — and 
I do — not even the Presidency will 
be big enough for him. 

So I’m going back to Julie. 

npHERE are some obvious ques- 
tions in your mind, I know, 
such as: Why did I get the form- 
ula for Krasnow, knowing there 
was no way for him to prosecute 



me while I was in Julie’s dimen- 
sion? And what made me come 
back? 

In short — what was in it for 
me? 

Let’s call it research. Krasnow 
is a big-time operator; I’ve al- 
ways been, you might say, in the 
peanut end of the game. He had 
a great deal to teach me and I, 
I’m happy to say, was an apt 
pupil. You might speculate on 
what’s in it for you, because, if 
you ask me, anybody who can 
do the side-shuffle should do it 
before Krasnow becomes Presi- 
dent. 

However, don’t go to Seventeen 
Point Zero Eight unless you want 
to swap one Krasnow for another. 
The fact 'is that I’ve learned I 
can be one in Julie’s dimension. 
After all, their formula doesn’t 
work on me — but I can assure 
you that it will work on you. 

And that elephant story I told 
on my last visit is, as I’ve in- 
dicated, in the peanut category. 
All Krasnow has is a country. 
I’ll have a whole world. 

There’s nothing like study un- 
der a master, is there? 

I should be back to Julie by 
midnight if I start now.

I OVE came somewhat late to 
Dr. Sylvester Murt. In 
J fact, it took the epidemic 
of 1961 to break down his resist- 
ance. A great many people fell 
in love that year — just about 
every other person you talked to 
— so no one thought much about 
Dr. Murt’s particular distress, 
except a fellow victim who was

directly involved in this case. 

High Dawn Hospital, where 
38-year-old Dr. Murt was resi- 
dent pathologist, was not the 
first medical institution to take 
note of the “plague.” The symp- 
toms first came to the attention 
of the general practitioners, then 
to the little clinics where the 
G. P.s sent their patients. But 
long before anything medical was 
done about it, the plague was 
sweeping North and South Amer- 
ica and infiltrating every conti- 
nent and island in the world. 

Murt’s assistant, Dr. Phyllis 
Sutton, spotted the first irregu- 
larity in the Times one morning 
and mentioned it to him. They 
were having coffee in Murt’s pri- 
vate office-lab, after completing 
reports on two rush biopsies. 

She looked up from the editor- 
ial page and remarked, “You 
know, someone should do a re- 
search on the pathology of 
pantie raids.” 

Tt^URT spooned sugar into his 
mug of coffee and stared at 
her. In their six months’ associa- 
tion, it was the first facetious 
remark she had made in his 
presence. To this moment, he had 
held an increasing regard for her 
quiet efficiency, sobriety, profes- 
sional dignity and decorum. 
True, she wore her white coat 
more tightly belted than was 
necessary and, likewise, she re- 



fused to wear the very low hos- 
pital heels that thickened 
feminine ankles. But she wore a 
minimum of come-hither in both 
her cosmetic and personality 
makeup. This startling remark, 
then, was most unexpected. 

“Pantie raids?” he inquired. 
“Whatever would justify an in- 
quiry into such a patently be- 
havioristic problem?” 

“The epidemic nature and its 
increasing virulence,” she replied 
soberly. “This spring, the thing 
has gotten out of hand, according 
to this editorial. A harmless tra- 
dition at a few of the more unin- 
hibited campuses has turned 
into a national collegiate phe- 
nomenon. And now secondary ef- 
fects are turning up. Instructors 
say that intramural romance is 
turning the halls of ivy into ama- 
tory rendezvous.” 

Murt sipped his coffee and 
said, "Be thankful you aren’t a 
psychiatrist. Bacterial mutations 
are enough of a problem, without 
pondering unpredictable emo- 
tional disturbances.” 

His assistant pursued it further. 
“It says the classrooms are emp- 
tying into the marriage bureaus, 
and graduation exercises this year 
will be a mockery if something 
isn’t done. What’s more, statis- 
tics show a startling increase in 
marriages at the high school 
level.” 

Murt shrugged broad shoulders

that were slightly bent from long 
hours over a microscope. “Then 
be thankful you aren’t an over- 
worked obstetrician,” he offered 
as an amendment. 

She glanced up from the paper, 
with annoyance showing in her 
dark, well-spaced eyes. “Is it of 
no interest to you that several 
hundred thousand youngsters are 
leaving high school and college 
prematurely because they can’t 
control their glands?” 

“Be glad, then,” Murt said 
coldly, “that you aren’t an en- 
docrinologist — now drink your 
coffee. I hear the microtome 
working. We’ll have some busi- 
ness in a minute.” 

Dr. Phyllis Sutton rustled the 
pages of the Times together, 
folded it up and threw it at the 
wastebasket with more vigor than 
was necessary. The subject was 
momentarily closed. 

TJIS staff position at High 
Dawn paid less, but the life 
suited Dr. Murt better than the 
hectic, though lucrative, private 
practices of many of his col- 
leagues. He arrived at the hospi- 
tal early, seven o’clock each day, 
to be on hand for quick tissue 
examinations during the morning 
operations. By ten, the biopsies 
were usually out of the way, and 
he spent the rest of the morning 
and early afternoon checking 
material from the bacteriology

section and studying post-opera- 
tive dissections of tumorous 
tissues and organs removed in 
surgery. 

It was engrossing, important 
work, and it could be accomplish- 
ed in a normal work-day, leaving 
the pathologist considerable lei- 
sure to study, read and relax. 
Shortly after the pantie-raid con- 
versation with Phyllis Sutton, he 
found the evening paper attract- 
ing more than his usual quick 
perusal. 

This emotional fuss in the 
young human animal was begin- 
ning to preoccupy the newspaper 
world. Writers were raising their 
eyebrows and a new crop of 
metaphors at the statistics, which 
they described variously as 
alarming, encouraging, disheart- 
ening, provocative, distressing, 
romantic or revolting, depending 
upon the mood and point of 
view. 

As June, the traditional mating 
month, wore into July, national 
statistics were assembled to re- 
veal that marriages were occur- 
ring at almost double the highest 
previous rate, that the trend was 
accelerating rather than dimin- 
ishing. 

Jewelers and wholesale dia- 
mond merchants chalked up fab- 
ulous increases in the sale of 
engagement and wedding set- 
tings. Clergymen and qualified 
public officials were swamped 

73 



with requests for religious and 
civil marriage ceremonies. 

Parks, beaches and drive-in 
theaters were jammed with 
mooning and/or honeymooning 
couples, and amusement parks 
began expanding their overpa- 
tronized tunnel-of-love facilities. 

The boom in houses, furniture, 
appliances and TV was on, and 
last year’s glut of consumer goods 
for the home was rapidly turning 
into a shortage. 

All was not good news, how- 
ever. The divorce courts reported 
their calendars stacked months 
ahead of time, and an increasing 
number of lurid headlines were 
devoted to the love-triangular 
troubles of the rich, famous and 
notorious. Love-nest exposes and 
bigamous marriages rocketed in 
number. 

The whole world, adolescent 
and adult, was falling in love, 
with the inevitable unrequited in- 
fatuations, the jealousies, infideli- 
ties and the bitter-sweetness of 
wholesale, illicit, impossible love 
situations in which vulnerable 
people found themselves increas- 
ing astronomically. 

Writers of popular newspaper 
psychology columns attributed 
the rampaging emotional fire to 
everything from mass-hysteria, 
caused by sunspots, to the pa- 
ternalism of a government that 
gave increased income-tax de- 
ductions to married people. 



"P|R. Murt’s growing interest 
was not entirely academic. 
His bachelorhood was no acci- 
dent of fate, but rather a care- 
fully contrived independence, for 
which he paid the price of eternal 
vigilance. As the world supply 
of eligible bachelors diminished 
sharply, his wariness increased, 
and he became more and more 
curt with nurses and female tech- 
nicians at the hospital. 

He revealed the depth of his 
leeriness one afternoon at the 
scrub-up sink, where he and his 
assistant were washing after a 
messy dissection. Phyllis Sutton 
remarked, “Holly, down in Per- 
sonnel, showed me a tabulation 
she ran off for her own curiosity 
today, Doctor. Do you realize 
that in this whole hospital there 
are only eight unmarried female 
employees?” 

Murt threw water droplets 
from his bare arms and muttered, 
“Yes, and every one of them’s 
giving me the eye — to say noth- 
ing of half the married ones.” 

His aide dried her long arms 
and slender hands and looked 
at him with a crooked smile. 
“Not to underestimate your good 
looks, Doctor, but I am one of 
the unmarried females. I trust 
I’m not giving you too much 
trouble?” 

He looked up, startled. “Yes — 
no, no — of course not. I'm refer- 
ring to the nurses and the tech- 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nicians. What’s got into them? 
The whole lot seems to be on 
the make!” 

Phyllis combed out her short 
dark hair and looked at him in 
the mirror. “I assure you the 
males are just as bad. These in- 
terns and four of the male nurses 
give me a physical with their 
eyes every time I happen to 
meet them.” 

“I suppose this ties in somehow 
with your pantie-raid theory.” 
“Well, what do you think?” 

“I don’t think. I just dodge. 
You’d do well to do the same,” 
Murt told her, putting on his 
jacket and adjusting his tie. 

She sat down in his oak swivel- 
chair and crossed her slender 
ankles. “Are you aware of the 
problem they have downstairs in 
the out-patient clinic?” 

“Hadn’t heard,” Murt said. 

CHE removed a file from her 
^ purse and touched up her 
short nails. “The outlying clinics 
are sending their overflow to us. 
They can’t seem to diagnose the 
odd symptoms they’re getting.” 
“I had noticed the large num- 
ber of negative test results com- 
ing out of the lab,” Murt 
acknowledged. “Haven’t followed 
any of them through, though.” 

“I have,” Phyllis said with a 
little frown. “Seems to be a psy- 
chosdmatic nightmare down 
there.” 



“What are the symptoms?” 
“Mostly neurotic,” she said. 
“Listlessness, loss of appetite, 
palpitations, cold sweats and ab- 
sent-mindedness.” 

“Why don’t they go to the psy- 
chiatric clinics?” 

“Overloaded. They’re sending 
patients here.” 

“What age groups?” 

"From puberty to senility. I’d 
like your permission to do a 
little special work on blood 
samples.” 

“Another theory?” he asked 
caustically. 

“Yes. Will you give me your 
permission to test it?” 

Murt adjusted his Panama 
straw in the mirror and noticed 
that the nostrils of his straight 
nose were flared for some reason. 
“Your time is your own after 
three p. m. every day. If you 
want to take time out from your 
thesis research, that’s your busi- 
ness.” 

He crossed to the door and 
was opening it when he became 
aware that he had had no answer. 
He looked back at the profile of 
his assistant’s body, which was 
now stretched out full length, 
suspended at three points — her 
higher-than-practical heels on the 
linoleum tile, her spine and curv- 
ed hips using only an inch of the 
chair’s edge, and her head tilted 
over the chair’s back. She inhaled 
from a king-size filter -tip cigar-

ette and blew a feather of smoke 
at the ceiling. 

“Yuh!" she said finally. Her 
flat abdomen jumped at the ex- 
haled syllable, and so did her 
generous breasts under the soft 
emerald-green street dress. 

“Good night!" Murt closed the 
door behind him quickly and be- 
came aware of a sharp stab of 
what he defined as pure rut — 
the first he had suffered in fif- 
teen years. 

II 

TTE taxied downtown to the 
athletic club, where he main- 
tained his three-room apartment. 
The 20-story building was a cita- 
del of masculinity — no females 
allowed — and recently it was an 
especial relief to enter the lobby 
and leave behind the world of 
turbulently mixed sexes. 

The small but lush entry 
chamber had a deserted air about 
it this afternoon. At the room 
desk, Crumbley, the clerk, hand- 
ed him his key with a pallid 
hand and returned to sigh over 
a colored picture in Esquire — it 
was the “fold-out” page, featur- 
ing a gorgeous blonde reclining 
at full length. Crumbley’s ex- 
pression, however, was far from 
the loose-lipped, lecherous leer 
that he normally exposed to such 
art. His eyes had a thin glaze 
over them, he breathed shallowly 



and, if Dr. Murt had not known 
the little man’s cynically pro- 
miscuous nature so well, he’d 
have sworn Crumbley was in love. 

Upstairs, Murt donned rubber- 
soled gym shoes and sweat 
clothes and rode the elevator 
back down to the gymnasium. 
Three times a week, he put his 
muscles through the whole rou- 
tine — work on the bars, rings, 
the leather horse, the rope climb 
and a twenty-lap jog around the 
balcony racetrack. Afterward, he 
showered, took a dip in the swim- 
ming pool and retired to the 
health service department for a 
rubdown and some sunlamp. 

Throughout the whole routine, 
he encountered not a single other 
member. While Charlie, the 
husky blond masseur, hammered 
and kneaded his muscles, Murt 
reflected on the abating interest 
in athletics at the club. 

“Are we losing members, Char- 
lie?” he asked. 

“You’d think so from how dead 
it is up here,” Charlie replied. 
“But Crumbley says we aren’t. 
The guys just aren’t exercising. 
Can’t figure it, Doc. Even with 
the usual summer slump, it’s 
never been this slow.” 

When he had absorbed all the 
punishment he could stand, Murt 
rolled off, went into the ultra- 
violet room, set an alarm clock 
and lay down by himself on one 
of the paper-covered tables. He 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



adjusted the dark goggles and re- 
flected thankfully that he didn’t 
have to go to the beach for his 
sun and have sand kicked in 
his face by a procession of pre- 
datory females, ogling his long 
limbs and trying to attract his 
attention. 

The clean smell of ozone was 
pleasant, the warmth of the 
lamps relaxed him, and he dozed 
off. He dreamed that he heard 
someone else come in and lie 
down on the next table and. 
when he raised his head to see 
who it was, was amazed to dis- 
cover his assistant, Dr. Phyllis 
Sutton, stretched out like him- 
self, wearing only shower-sandals 
and goggles. 

The alarm clock wakened him 
from the disturbing dream. He 
was sweating profusely and took 
another shower, using the cold 
water at full needle force to dis- 
pel his shock at his subconscious. 

RAPPING the robe around 
** him, Murt returned to his 
apartment to dress for dinner. 
As he snapped the paper laundry 
band off a clean shirt, he caught 
himself wondering how old Phyl- 
lis Sutton was. Twenty-eight? 
Thirty? She appeared younger, 
but she was in her last year of 
residence to gain her specialty 
of pathology. That meant over 
eleven years of school and prac- 
tice. She was a lovely creature, 

MATE IN TWO MOVES 



but she was no child. 

He had half an impulse to 
phone her for dinner, then be- 
came lost in studying his own 
reaction to the thought. Pulse 
over a hundred, respiration 
quickening, irregular. There was 
a tensing of the abdomen, a 
faint burning in the pit of his 
stomach. 

He remembered the urge at the 
office, the dream in the sunroom, 
the sudden sweat that had re- 
quired five minutes under the 
cold needle shower. 

After so many years of deliber- 
ate, scholarly celibacy, what was 
happening to him? 

He stared at the phone. With 
six motions of one finger, he 
could dial Phyllis Sutton’s face 
into view, and suddenly he yearn- 
ed to do that very ridiculous 
thing. 

After staring at her, off and on, 
for the six months since she had 
transferred to High Dawn to 
complete her residency, now he 
wanted to see her face outside of 
working hours for some inexplic- 
able reason. 

Call her up, date her, take her 
dancing, proposition her — get 
this silly feeling off your chest! 

Suppose she was busy or re- 
fused to go out with him? Sup- 
pose she already had a boy 
friend? 

This last thought deepened the 
burn in the pit of his stomach, 

77 



and he finished dressing listlessly. 
To hell with it! This was poker 
night. If he did succeed in dating 
his assistant, they’d inevitably 
talk shop. That was why he en- 
joyed a night of cards with his 
six non-medical brother clubmen, 
once a week. It was refreshing to 
break away from the professional 
point of view. 

No, he wouldn’t sacrifice that 
for any woman. 

TTE ate alone, read the paper, 
joined the poker party at 
seven o’clock, played six hands 
of stud, cashed in his chips and 
returned to his room. In a mood 
of deep irritation, he found Phyl- 
lis Sutton’s home phone number 
and rang it four times with no 
result. 

He thought to try the hospital. 
She answered from the. lab ex- 
tension on audio only, but her 
voice and its frankly curious 
tone sent vertically polarized 
chills through him. 

“I — I wanted to apologize for 
my rudeness this afternoon,” he 
said with difficulty from a sud- 
denly dry mouth. 

There was a brief silence. 
“Have you been drinking, Dr. 
Murt?” He noticed that she did 
not call him Sylvester. Why was 
he so damned thirsty for some 
little sign of warmth and friend- 
liness from her? 

He cleared his throat. “No, I’m 



serious. It occurred to me that 
your interest in the out-clinic 
problem was commendable, and 
that I was rather short in my re- 
marks to you.” 

“Oh! I take it I have your 
permission to work my project in 
during the day, then?” 

“That’s right, so long as it 
doesn’t interfere with the rou- 
tine.” He sounded stuffy to him- 
self, but he was entirely out of 
practice in speaking to please a 
female. 

“Thanks,” she said wryly, and 
the conversation ended. 

Somehow, the brief talk with 
her restored his perspective. Once 
again she was his assistant, and 
the significance of her as a wo- 
man faded. She was a dedicated 
physician like himself. In another 
few years, she would find a resi- 
dency of her own. She had no 
more inclination to knock off and 
become a woman than he had to 
squander his time and energy 
on attaining the status of family 
man. 

I T was with mounting admira- 
tion that he followed her new 
project in examining blood sam- 
ples. As they came up from the 
clinic, she sorted the specimen 
tubes at once, putting a tiny snip 
of yellow Scotch tape under the 
label of each sample that belong- 
ed to a patient with the new 
undiagnosed disorder. 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Then, after the requested he- 
moglobin, blood sugar and other 
standard tests had been run, she 
retrieved the samples from the 
technicians, grouped them in a 
special rack and devoted every 
spare minute to further examina- 
tion. 

She centrifuged, precipitated, 
filtered and stained over and 
over, using every qualitative pro- 
cedure in the book. Murt signed 
her requisitions for exotic re- 
agents and rare stains. He helped 
her balance out the large centri- 
fuge to get the maximum r.p.m. 
from it. He let her use the most 
costly of the fine-porosity filters. 

He had little hope of success, 
but it was good practice for her. 
She was required to identify 
every organism she found, bone 
up on its known effects, then de- 
termine that it could not cause 
the symptoms reported. 

She did all this without im- 
pairing her usefulness to Murt. 
When he needed her, she was at 
his side, dissecting, taking down 
notes, preparing delicate sections 
and checking slides before they 
came to him. 

In several weeks, she exhausted 
all known tests on the first sam- 
ples. After lunch one day, she 
turned her palms up. "Nichts 
da!” she said, pulling a mashed 
cigarette from the huge pocket 
of her whit.e smock. 

He glanced at her and swiveled 



to stare out the window. It was 
part of his tight campaign to 
prevent a disastrous recurrence 
of the emotional tempest he had 
suffered the day she had begun 
this research. 

“It was a nice brush-up on 
your bacteriology,” he said. 
“Have you saved the filtrates?” 

“Yes, of course. Did I overlook 
anything?” 

“Nothing that we could do 
here, but there’s an electron 
microscope downtown at Ebert 
Industrial Labs. How about pho- 
tomicrography? Could be a fil- 
trable virus.” 

He knew that she was aware of 
the possibility, and also that she 
was reluctant to ask him for ad- 
ditional funds to go into a virus 
hunt with the expensive piece of 
equipment. 

“Wonderful!” she told him. “I 
did hate to ask you, but it would 
be a shame to waste all that im- 
maculate filtrate.” 

Ill 

A WEEK passed, during which 
a bulletin from the Govern- 
ment Health Service announced 
official suspicion that the human 
race was suffering a mysterious, 
pandemic affliction which was as 
yet undiagnosed. Although the 
symptoms, as reported by hun- 
dreds of clinics, were relatively 
mild, the effect on the nation’s 



MATE IN TWO MOVES 



79 



economy was growing serious. 

Industry and business reported 
unprecedented absenteeism. Fac- 
tory supervisors and insurance 
companies were frantic over the 
upsurge in accidents. It was esti- 
mated that almost fifty per cent 
of the population exhibited the 
symptoms of depression, absent- 
mindedness, insomnia and loss of 
appetite. 

Negligent driving was increas- 
ing the highway toll sharply. Ed- 
ucational institutions reported 
classroom discipline rapidly van- 
ishing. Armed forces headquar- 
ters cautiously admitted a new 
high in desertions and AWOLs. 

The consensus among psychi- 
atrists and psychologists was that 
the condition stemmed from pa- 
thogenic causes. 

Dr. Murt raised his eyebrows 
when he read this. Perhaps Phyl- 
lis Sutton was right, after all. 

The bulletin continued, “All 
clinical pathologists are requested 
to be alert to the presence of any 
unusual organisms discovered in 
body fluids or tissues examined. 
Please report your findings to the 
U. S. Public Health Service.” 

Murt found Phyllis Sutton^at 
the microtome, finishing a wax 
section, and showed her the bul- 
letin. 

“Score one for woman’s intui- 
tion,” he smiled. “Federal Health 
Service tends to agree with your 
theory.” 



“Now I am eager to see those 
pictures,” she said. 

T ESS than two hours later, a 
messenger brought the photo- 
micrographs, and the two patho- 
logists bent over them together. 
Phyllis had submitted eighteen 
samples, six of which were con- 
trols taken from healthy, un- 
afflicted subjects. Per her 
instructions, smears of the speci- 
mens in various degrees of dilu- 
tion had been photographed 
through the great electron micro- 
scope. 

Murt muttered to himself as 
they compared the controls with 
the “infected specimens.” The 
“healthy” samples were relative- 
ly clear, except for minute pro- 
tein matter. Conversely, . all 
twelve suspect specimens swarm- 
ed with shadowy six-sided dots. 

Phyllis’ eyes widened. “There 
is something there! Do you sup- 
pose it could be the Love Bug?” 
“Love Bug?” 

“Certainly. That bulletin didn’t 
go into the psychologists’ find- 
ings. The diagnosticians down- 
stairs say that the symptoms 
appear to be no more than com- 
plaints of the lovesick.” 

“Are you back on the pantie- 
raid theme again?” 

“I’ve never been off it,” she 
replied. “From the first, I’ve had 
a notion that some organism was 
increasing glandular activity. Ex- 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




MATE IN TWO MOVES 



81 



cess emotionalism often origin- 
ates in overstimulated glands.” 
“Of course, but mental atti- 
tudes can trigger the glands, and 
they are interacting. How do you 
separate the effects? How could 
you guess that an organism was 
responsible?” 

She shrugged. “It was a pos- 
sibility within our specialty, so 
I set out to prove or disprove it. 
From the appearance of these 
photographs, I don’t think we 
have disproved it.” 

It was a properly cautious 
statement that pleased Murt. 
They were a long way from prov- 
ing that their newly discovered 
virus was the culprit, but the 
research had definitely produced 
a question mark. 

Murt ordered copies of the 
photomicrographs from Ebert In- 
dustrial Labs and arranged for 
a complete dossier to be forward- 
ed to the U. S. Health Service. 

That night, he was startled by 
a headline and lead story that 
quoted the government bulletin. 
The science editor had a field 
day. tying in speculation that 
“Doctors Suspect Love Bug Epi- 
demic.” 

HPHE next day, three reporters 
called upon him, each with 
the same query. “It’s rumored 
that you are doing research 
on the Love Bug, Dr. Murt. 
Anything to report?” 



He shooed them out angrily, 
after learning that someone at 
Ebert Labs had given them the 
tip. Phyllis smiled at him as he 
slammed the door after the last 
reporter. 

“You still discount the Love- 
Bug idea, don’t you?” she asked. 

“I dislike sensationalism in a 
matter like this,” he said. “Even 
if their assumptions were true, I 
wouldn’t like it.” 

“You can’t blame the papers. 
They’re starved for some ex- 
planation. I pity your passion for 
anonymity if your virus proves 
to be the causative factor.” 

"My virus?” 

“Certainly. The whole project 
is under your auspices and di- 
rection.” 

“See here, Phyl, you did the 
work.” 

“Don’t you dare mention my 
name,” she said. “You’re my su- 
perior and senior pathologist and 
it’s your duty to protect me 
against the press. I don’t want 
columnists popping out of my 
bathroom any more than you 
do.” 

Murt gave up. “The argument 
is entirely anticipatory,” he point- 
ed out. “The virus might turn out 
to be a batch of dormant Ger- 
man measles. Would you con- 
sider having dinner with me to- 
night?” 

“Why?” She shot the question 
back at him like a rebounding

tennis ball. “Answer that first!” 

Murt opened his mouth. He 
could not recall ever hearing such 
a rude rejoinder to an invitation 
to dinner. Not that there had 
been a plethora of amenities be- 
tween them, but this was un- 
thinkable! The question was, 
why should she have dinner with 
him? Give her eight good rea- 
sons. What was his motive in 
asking her? In one word, why? 

Murt searched her face, but 
only a quiet interest showed in 
her expression. 

“Why does any man invite any 
woman to dinner?” he countered. 

“You aren’t any man, Dr. 
Murt. Nor am I any woman. I 
want your specific reason for in- 
viting me to dinner. Is it to 
discuss professional matters or — 
what?” 

“Good Lord, Dr. Sutton!” He 
followed her lead in using the 
formal address. “Man is a social 
animal! I would enjoy your com- 
pany at dinner, that’s all. At 
least, I thought I would.” 

She looked at him unrelent- 
ingly. “If the talk will be about 
baseball, books or billiards, I’m 
for it. If it’s to be moonlight, 
roses and dimmed lights — no 
sale.” 

TT was like asking one’s grand- 
father for a date. His regard 
for her highly professional ap- 
proach turned to resentment. 

MATE IN TWO MOVES 



After all, she was a woman, a 
woman who persisted in belting 
her smock too tightly and wear- 
ing sheer nylons. Why this ab- 
surd revulsion at his casual 
acknowledgment of her sex? 

He almost withdrew the invi- 
tation, but changed his mind at 
the last moment. “You name the 
place and the subject for con- 
versation.” 

She nodded. “Very well, I’ll 
pick you up at seven.” 

He had his date — with an 
emancipated female, and she 
didn’t let him forget it during 
the whole meal. The restaurant 
she picked was expensive, but 
about as romantic as a bus depot. 
She ordered beer instead of a 
cocktail, toyed wordlessly with a 
$5.00 steak, and argued over the 
check. 

Only as they were preparing to 
leave did she betray a sign of 
femininity. A platinum blonde, 
two tables away, had been eying 
Murt. Suddenly, she lurched to 
her feet without a word to her 
escort, staggered over to the 
pathologist, slurred, “You’re what 
I’ve b’n lookin’ for all m’life,” and 
planted a wet alcoholic kiss on 
his mouth before he could de- 
fend himself. 

Her escort peeled her away 
with sad-eyed apologies. There 
was no jealousy or anger in his 
face, only a deep hurt. “She — 
she isn’t well, I think,” he said. 

83 



“You know, this new — whatever 
it is that’s going around.” 

Murt wiped off the lipstick and 
looked at Phyllis, expecting to 
find at best sardonic amusement, 
but she seemed pale and an- 
noyed. 

“I’m sorry I brought you here,” 
she said. 

“Think nothing of it,” Murt 
told her. “You heard the man. 
This is what’s going around. Do 
you think I’ll catch it?” 

Phyllis wasn’t amused. She did 
let him ride the taxi to her apart- 
ment, but bade him a terse good- 
by at the door. 

Except for the incident of the 
blonde and Phyl’s reaction, the 
evening had been a bust. Murt 
wondered how he had ever visual- 
ized her as a warm-blooded, re- 
sponsive female. He smiled at the 
evening of torment she had once 
given him. 

She was entirely frigid or else 
so leery of men that she might 
as well have been one herself. 

IV 

T HE following morning, he pre- 
sided at a specialists’ confer- 
ence at the hospital, during which 
he revealed the results of the 
blood research. They had all 
read the Health Service bulletin 
and were sharply interested in 
the photomicrographs. 

When the meeting was over, 



Feldman, the bacteriologist, and 
Stitchell, an endocrinologist, vol- 
unteered to work with Murt. 
They gave Phyllis’ “gland-irrita- 
tion” theory more credence than 
Murt. He outlined a program. 
Both agreed to take the problem 
back to their own departments. 

The conference set Murt be- 
hind in his work and he spoke 
scarcely five words to his assist- 
ant until he was ready to leave. 
As he finished scrubbing up, she 
handed him an early edition of 
the Times. 

“Local Doctor Isolates Love 
Bug!” The story was sketchy and 
not half so positive as the head- 
line, but it did name him and 
High Dawn Hospital, and de- 
scribed the new virus. 

He stared at Phyllis Sutton. 
“Did you — ” 

“Of course not. The reporters 
were here, but I sent them away. 
I told them we were medicine 
men, not tobacco men.” 

“Your name isn’t even men- 
tioned,” he said suspiciously. 

“You signed the report to the 
Health Service,” she pointed out. 
“The leak probably came at that 
end.” She put her hand on his 
arm. “It wasn’t your fault.” 

His fury cooled as he noted 
her gesture. Then she realized 
that he was looking down at her 
hand and withdrew it quickly. 

The next few days were blind- 
ly busy. A note from the govern - 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ment acknowledged receipt of his 
report and pictures, and was fol- 
lowed by a message that the virus 
could not be identified. The im- 
plication was that there was a 
strong possibility that it was the 
causative factor in the new 
malaise. 

Tl/fURT devoted more attention 
to the joint laboratory work 
on the virus. The newspapers 
continued to come up with confi- 
dential information they shouldn’t 
have had, and they dubbed the 
Love Bug, Murt's Virus. The 
name stuck, and the pathologist 
found himself famous overnight. 

Phyllis continued to force all 
the credit upon him, on threat 
of transferring out if he violated 
her confidence. Except for the 
nuisance of dodging reporters, 
the accolade was not entirely un- 
pleasant. 

His pictures — old ones, Lord 
knew where they had dug them 
up — began appearing in the pa- 
pers. Instead of reproving him, 
the hospital board voted him a 
substantial salary increase and 
gave him a free hand in directing 
the research. A government grant 
was obtained to supplement his 
budget, and the work picked up 
speed. 

Necessarily, the lead that 
Phyllis Sutton’s early research 
had given them on the rest of the 
medical world was maintained 



largely because of the time lag in 
disseminating the information 
contained in Murt’s report, and 
the additional time it took for 
other clinical laboratories to con- 
firm it. 

Cages of experimental animals 
began arriving along with several 
additional specialists. Ebert In- 
dustrial Labs, contrite over the 
original information leak, made 
available their electron micro- 
scope, and Murt assigned the 
new toxicologist to work over 
there with Feldman, the bacteri- 
ologist, studying ways to weaken 
or destroy the virus. 

Stitchell, the endocrinologist, 
and a trio of psychologists from 
the State University began in- 
jecting monkeys with virus when 
Feldman found he could propa- 
gate it in sterile medium. 

On September 12, 1961, Dr. 
Sylvester Murt became a victim 
of the virus which bore his name. 

TTE had slept poorly and he 
awakened feeling empty. His 
first dismal thought was that 
Phyl wouldn’t be at the hospital 
this morning. He had told her 
to spend a few hours down at 
Ebert Labs, getting notes on their 
progress. 

As he shaved, dressed and 
breakfasted, this thought preyed 
on his mind. It wasn’t until he 
had put in half the morning 
clock-watching and door-gazing 



MATE IN TWO MOVES 



85 



that he stepped outside his 
wretchedness and took an ob- 
jective look at his feelings. 

It wasn’t that he missed her 
help — he had plenty of personnel 
at his disposal now. He simply 
longed for the sight of her, for 
the sound of her voice and her 
heels clipping busily around his 
office-lab. 

Here we go again, he thought, 
and then he came up short. The 
feeling was similar to the silly 
evening of infatuation he had al- 
lowed himself, but it was intensi- 
fied tenfold. The burn in his 
stomach was almost painful. He 
caught himself sighing like a 
frustrated poet, and he grew to 
hate the sight of the hall door, 
through which she kept right on 
not appearing. 

When she failed to show up 
by 11:30, and he gagged over his 
lunch, he knew he was sick. 

He had Murt’s Virus! 

Now what? Did knowing you 
had it make it any easier? Easier 
to make a damned fool of him- 
self, he supposed. He'd have to 
take hold of himself or he’d 
scare her off the grounds. 

At the thought of her leaving 
him for good, something like a 
dull crosscut saw hacked across 
his diaphragm, and he dropped 
his forkful of potato salad. 

Back at his office, he diluted 
30 cc of pure grain alcohol with 
water and swallowed it. Some of 



the distress and anxiety symp- 
toms were relieved, and he bent 
determinedly to his work. 

When her distinctive steps fi- 
nally came through the door, he 
refused to raise his head from 
the binocular microscope. “How 
are they making out over there?’’ 
he mumbled. 

“It’s slow,” she said, dropping 
her notes on his desk. “They’re 
halfway through the sulfas so 
far. No results yet.” 

R ELIEF at having her near 
him again was so great, it 
was almost frightening. But he 
gained equal pleasure from find- 
ing his self-control adequate to 
keep from raising his head and 
devouring her with his eyes. 

“Sylvester,” her voice came 
from behind his stool, “if you 
don’t mind, I’d rather not go 
over there again.” 

“Why not?” 

Her voice was strangely soft. 
“Because I — I missed . .” 

At that instant, her hand rest- 
ed on his shoulder and it sent 
a charge of high voltage through 
him. He stiffened. 

“ Don't do that!" he said sharp- 
ly- 

He could see her reflection 
dimly in the window glass. She 
took a step backward. “What’s 
the matter, Sylvester?” 

He fought back the confusion 
in his brain, considered explain- 



86

mg that he was- making a fine 
adjustment on the scope. But he 
didn’t. He turned and let her 
have it. "Because I’ve got the 
virus,” he said in a flat voice. 
"And the object of my affection 
— or infected, overstimulated 
glands — is you!” 

“Oh, dear! That blonde at the 
restaurant . .” Phyl’s face was 
pale, but she composed her fea- 
tures quickly. "Do you want me 
to leave?” 

"Lord no! That magnifies the 
symptoms. Stay with me and — 
and just be yourself. I won’t 
bother you. If I lay a finger on 
you, clobber me.” 

"Have you had your blood 
tested?” 

“I don’t have to. I’ve got all 
the symp — ” 

He broke off, realizing that he 
was taking for granted that the 
new virus was the cause of his 
feeling. Clinically, this was no- 
where near proved yet. Slowly 
he rolled up his sleeve above the 
elbow. He dipped a swatch of 
gauze in alcohol and swabbed a 
vein. 

"All right, Phyl, you’re the 
doctor. Make with the syringe.” 

T> Y nightfall, Murt came to un- 
" derstand the reasons for the 
increase in industrial accidents, 
absenteeism and the rest of the 
social effects of the "mild” epi- 
demic. Phyllis Sutton was in his 



mind constantly. He deliberately 
did not look at her. But he was 
aware of her every movement, 
the texture and shape of her 
hand when she handed him a 
slide, the scent of her powder, 
the sound of her heels. 

When she left the room, he 
found himself awaiting her re- 
turn and conjecturing on what 
she was doing every moment. Not 
that it was difficult to adjust his 
behavior — no, that was relatively 
easy. All he had to do was think 
about every remark he made to 
her, censoring word, inflection 
and tone of voice — and, by keep- 
ing his back to her, it was easy 
to prevent his eyes from darting 
glances at her profile and staring 
at the curve of her hip below 
the tight belt. 

By staying busy, he fought off 
the depression until he left for 
the club, when it closed in on him 
like an autumn fog. He stopped 
at the club bar. 

Curly, the bald-headed bar- 
tender, eyed him curiously when 
he ordered a double Scotch. 

“Heavy going down at the hos- 
pital these days?” Curly asked. 

Murt envied him his relaxed, 
carefree expression. He nodded. 
"Pretty busy. I suppose you’re 
catching it, too. Lot of people 
drowning their sorrows these 
days?” 

Curly looked up at the clock. 
"You said it! In about a half 



MATE IN TWO MOVES

hour, the place’ll be loaded. This 
epidemic is going to run the dis- 
tilleries dry if it doesn’t end 
pretty soon.” 

“Does liquor help any?” 
“Seems to— a little. It’s the 
damnedest thing! Everybody’s in 
love with the wrong people — I 
mean ten times as bad as usual. 
Of course, not everybody. Take 
my wife — she’s got it bad, but 
she’s still in love with me. So it 
could be worse.” 

W HAT do you mean?” Murt 
asked, raising his head. 

“I mean it’s bad enough for the 
poor woman to have the guy she 
wants. It’s the jealousy angle. 
Every minute I’m away, she sits 
at home wondering if I’m faith- 
ful. Calls me up six times a shift. 
I don’t dare take her out any- 
place. Every time another female 
comes in sight, she starts worry- 
ing. Kate’s a damned good wife, 
always has been, or I wouldn’t 
be putting up with it. That’s 
what’s happening to a lot of 
marriages. Some guys get fed up 
and start looking around. About 
that time, the bug bites them 
and look out, secretary!” 

“But it’s not her fault,” Murt 
said emphatically. 

“I know,” Curly shrugged. “A 
lot of people don’t make any 
allowances for it, though. You 
know Peter, the elevator boy? He 
and his wife both got it. For a 



while it was okay, but I guess 
they finally drove themselves 
nuts, keeping tabs on each other. 
Now they can’t stand to be to- 
gether and they can’t stand to 
be apart. Poor joker ran the cage 
past the basement limit-switch 
three times today and had to be 
bailed out of the shaft. Mr. 
Johnson said he’d fire him if he 
could get another boy.” 

The implication was shocking 
to Murt. He had supposed that 
unhappiness would stem prin- 
cipally from cases of unrequited 
love, such as his own, but it was 
apparent that the disease magni- 
fied the painful aspects of mutual 
love as well. Over-possessiveness 
and jealousy were common reefs 
of marriage, so it was hardly 
illogical that the divorce courts 
were as busy as the marriage 
license bureaus, after all. 

IT helped a little to immerse 
-*■ himself in the troubles of 
others, but, after another double 
Scotch, he went to his apartment 
and immediately fell into de- 
spondency. The desire to phone 
Phyllis was almost overpowering, 
though he knew talking to her 
wouldn’t help. Instead, he dressed 
and went to dinner. The club 
boasted a fine chef, but the food 
tasted like mucilage. 

Later, he went to the bar and 
drank excessively. Yet he had to 
take a sedative to get to sleep. 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He awoke in a stupor at ten 
o’clock. His phone was jangling 
persistently. It was Phyllis Sut- 
ton, and her face showed sharp 
concern. 

“Are you all right, Sylvester?” 

For a moment his hangover 
dominated, but then it all came 
back. “Good morning! I’m greatV’ 
he moaned. 

“Stitchell and the new toxi- 
cologist think they have some- 
thing to report,” she said. 

“So do I. Alcohol is positively 
not the answer.” 

“This is important. Your sug- 
gestion on the sulfa series seems 
to have paid off.” 

“I’ll be right over,” he said, 
“as soon as I amputate my 
head.” 

“Come down to the zoo. I’ll 
be there.” 

The thought of a remedy that 
might relieve him was a fair 
hangover cure. He dressed quick- 
ly and even managed to swallow 
a little coffee and toast. 

V 

A T the hospital, he went di- 
rectly to the “zoo” in the 
basement. A knot of personnel, 
including Phyllis, Peterson, the 
toxicologist, and Feldman, open- 
ed to admit him to the cage 
under their inspection. A quick 
glance at the control cages show- 
ed no change in the undoctored 



monkeys. Males and females were 
paired off, huddling together 
miserably, chittering and sadly 
rubbing their heads together. 
Each couple eyed the other cou- 
ples suspiciously. Even here, the 
overpossessiveness was evident, 
and Murt cringed from the piti- 
ful, disconsolate expressions. 

The cage before him, however, 
appeared normally animated. 
The monks were feeding and 
playing happily. Feldman was 
grinning. “Had to try a new 
derivative, Sylvester, but the 
sulfa series was the right ap- 
proach.” 

Murt stared at the cage, red- 
eyed. “Hadn’t realized you suc- 
ceeded in producing the symp- 
toms in monkeys.” 

Phyllis said, “Why, I gave you 
that report yester — ” She broke 
off with an understanding glance. 

Peterson was exclaiming, “I 
never saw such a rapid-acting 
remedy! And so far, there’s no 
evidence of toxic effect.” 

“It must absorb directly into 
the gland tissue,” Feldman add- 
ed. “Hardly had time to mate- 
rially reduce the virus content 
significantly.” 

Murt murmured words of con- 
gratulations to them, turned on 
his heel and stalked out. Phyllis 
followed him to his office. 

“Get me some of the stuff and 
notes on the dosages they ad- 
ministered,” he ordered. 



MATE I N TWO MOV ES 



89 



"Certainly,” she said. “But why 
didn’t you ask — Dr. Mart, you 
aren't going to try it on your- 
self?" 

"Why not?” he barked hoarse- 
ly- 

“It’ll be weeks before we can 
determine if it’s safe,” she pro- 
tested, horrified. 

“We haven’t got weeks. Peo- 
ple are falling apart. This thing’s 
contagious.” 

Even while Murt said it, he felt 
it was the wrong approach. He 
knew his own perspective was 
shot, but Phyllis would probably 
try to protect him against him- 
self. 

She did not. Instead, her face 
softened with sympathy and 
something else he refused to iden- 
tify. She said, “I’ll be right back.” 

^TriHE pressure in his head 
throbbed down his neck into 
his body. He wanted her so much, 
it was difficult to resist follow- 
ing her out into the hall. She 
returned in a few minutes with a 
500-cc glass-stoppered reagent 
bottle half full of a milky fluid. 

“Oral administration?” he 
asked. 

She nodded. “Fifteen cc for the 
monkeys.” 

She secured a small beaker 
and a tapered graduate from the 
glassware cabinet and set them 
before him. He poured 50 cc into 
the graduated measure and trans- 



ferred it to the beaker. 

“What do they call it?” he 
asked. 

“Sulfa -tetradine,” she replied. 
“One of a series Peterson was 
testing. There is no physiological 
data on it yet. All he knows is 
that it inhibited the virus in 
culture. So they tried it on the 
monkeys.” 

Murt raised the beaker to his 
lips. It was against every sensible 
tenet of scientific procedure. He 
was amazed that Phyllis was si- 
lent as he swallowed the bland, 
ohalky fluid. He heard a clink. 
Turning, he saw her raising the 
graduate to her lips. In it was 
a like quantity of sulfa -tetradine. 

“What are you doing?” he 
half-shouted. “We don’t need a 
test-control!” 

“I’m not a control,” she said 
softly, touching her lips with a 
scrap of gauze. “I’ve had the 
virus for months.” 

He stared at her unbelievingly. 
“How do you know?” 

“One of the first test samples 
was my own blood,” she said. 
“You saw it. It was one of the 
twelve positive.” 

“But the symptoms — you don’t 
show a sign of — ” 

“Thanks,” she said. “I started 
to break down yesterday, but you 
didn’t notice. You see, you are 
my fixation and when you told 
me that you had it, too, I — ” 

“ Your fixation!” The beaker

slipped from his fingers and 
smashed to the tile. “ You’re in 
love with me?" 

Her arms hung loosely at her 
sides and tears rimmed her eyes. 
“Pathologically or otherwise, I’ve 
been a case since before I started 
the blood tests.” 

They moved together and clung 
to each other. “Phyl, Phyl — why 
didn’t you tell me?” 

EMERCELY, she closed his lips 
with her own, and her fingers 
dug deeply into his shoulders. His 
arms pulled her closer yet, trying 
to fill the void in him that was 
greater than the Universe. For a 
long minute, the knowledge of 
her love and physical contact 
with her straining body dispelled 
the bleak loneliness. 

When their lips parted, they 
gasped for breath. 

It was no good. It was like 
tearing at an itching insect bite 
with your fingernails. The relief 
was only momentary, and it left 
the wound bleeding and more 
irritated than ever. Even if they 
were married — look at Peter at 
the club— Peter and his wife, 
mutually in love and completely 
miserable. It wasn’t normal love. 
It was the damned virus! 

As well argue with gravity. He 
tried to tell her, but he couldn’t 
make her understand. Her re- 
straint had been magnificent, but 
when the dam broke, it was be- 



yond stopping the flood of her 
emotion. And now he couldn’t be- 
lieve it himself. Nothing this 
wonderful could be destroyed 
by mere misunderstanding. He 
cursed the years of his celibacy. 
All that time wasted — lost! 

It was six o’clock before they 
reached her apartment. The 
License Bureau had been a mob 
scene. Hours more, upstairs in 
the City Hall waiting for the 
judge, while they held hands like 
a pair of college sophomores, 
staring into each others’ eyes, 
drinking, drinking the elixir of 
adoration with a thirst that 
wouldn’t be sated. 

Phyllis weakened first. In the 
cab, after the ceremony, she re- 
leased his hand and wiped her 
damp forehead. 

Then, in the elevator, Murt felt 
himself relaxing. The alchemy of 
sustained passion had exhausted 
them both, he decided. 

As Phyllis slipped the key in 
the door, she looked up at him 
in surprise. “Do you know, I’m 
hungry. I’m starved — for the first 
time in months.” 

Murt discovered his own stom- 
ach was stirring with a prosaic 
pangful demand of its own. “We 
should have stopped to eat,” he 
said, realizing they had forgotten 
lunch. 

“ Steaks ! I have some beauties 
in my freezer!” Phyllis exclaimed. 
They peeled off their coats and 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



she led him into the small kitch- 
en. She pointed at the cupboard 
and silverware drawer. “Set the 
table. We’ll eat in five minutes.” 

S LIPPING into an apron, she 
explored the freezer for meat 
and French fries, dropped them 
into the HF cooker and set the 
timer for 90 seconds. When it 
clicked off, she was emptying a 
transparent sack of prepared 
salad into a bowl. 

"Coffee will be ready in 50 sec- 
onds, so let’s eat,” she announced. 

For minutes, they ate silently, 
ravenously, face to face in the 
little breakfast nook. Murt had 
forgotten the pure animal pleas- 
ure of satisfying a neglected ap- 
petite, and so, apparently, had 
his wife. 

Wife! The thought jolted him. 
Their eyes met, and he knew 
that the same thing was in her 
mind. 

The sulf a-tetradine ! 

With the edge barely off his 
hunger, he stopped eating. She 
did, too. They sipped the steam- 
ing coffee and looked at each 
other. 

“I — feel better,” Phyllis said at 
last. 

“So do I.” ' 

“I mean — I feel differently.” 
He studied her face. It was 
new. The tenseness was gone and 
it was a beautiful face, with soft 
lips and intelligent eyes. But now 

MATE IN TWO MOVES 



the eyes were merely friendly. 

And it aroused no more than a 
casual pleasure in him, the pleas- 
ure of viewing a lovely painting 
or a perfect sunset. A peaceful 
intellectual rapport settled over 
them, inducing a physical leth- 
argy. They spoke freely of their 
sensations, of the hypo-adrenal 
effects, and wondered that there 
was no unpleasant reaction. 
They decided that, initially at 
least, sulfa-tetradine was a mir- 
aculous success. Murt thought 
he should go back to the hospital 
and work out a report right away. 

Phyllis agreed and offered to 
accompany him, but he said she 
had better get a night’s sleep. 
The next day would be hectic. 

After four hours at his desk, 
he called a taxi and, without 
hesitation, gave the address of 
his club. Not until he fell wearily 
into bed did he remember it was 
his wedding night. 

By mutual agreement, the mar- 
riage was annulled the next day. 

Feldman and Peterson were 
gratified at the efficacy of their 
drug, but both were horrified that 
Murt had chosen to experiment 
on himself. As usual, Phyl had 
insisted on being left out of the 
report. 

A FTER a week of close obser- 
vation, one of the monkeys 
was chloroformed and tissue-by- 
tissue examination was made by 

93 



an army of histologists. Blood 
samples showed completely clear 
of the virus, as did a recheck on 
Murt’s own blood. No deleterious 
effects could be detected, so the 
results were published through 
the Government Health Service. 

It was the day before Christ- 
mas before Dr. Sylvester Murt 
first noticed the approaching 
symptoms of a relapse, or rein- 
fection — he couldn’t guess which. 
The past weeks had been pleas- 
antly busy and, as acclaimed 
authority on Murt’s virus, he 
had had little time to think sub- 
jectively about his experience. 

Sulfa-tetradine was now con- 
sidered the specific for the afflic- 
tion and was being produced and 
shipped by the carload all over 
the world. The press had over- 
generously insisted on giving him 
all the credit for the remedy as 
well as the isolation of the disease 
virus. He was an international 
hero. 

The warning of another attack 
came to him at 3:30 in the after- 
noon, when Phyllis Sutton was 
leaving. She stuck her head back 
in the door and gave him an un- 
commonly warm smile and cried, 
“Merry Christmas, Doctor!” 

He waved at her and, as the 
door closed, caught his breath. 
There was the burn in his stom- 
ach again. It passed away and 
he refused to give it further 
thought. 



His own cab wound its way 
through the heavy Christmas Eve 
traffic an hour before store-clos- 
ing time. Finally, the vehicle 
stalled in a jam. It was only six 
blocks to his club, so Murt paid 
off the driver and walked. 

Part of his strategy of bache- 
lorhood had been to ignore 
Christmas and the other senti- 
mental seasons, when loneliness 
costs many a man his independ- 
ence. But now it was impossible 
to ignore the snowflakes, the 
bustling, package-laden crowds 
and the street-corner Santa 
Clauses with their tinkling bells. 

TTE found himself staring into 
department store windows at 
the gay decorations. 

A pair of shimmering, nearly 
invisible nylons caught his eye. 
They were the most impalpable 
of substances, only their bare 
outline visible against the white 
background. 

He thought of Phyllis and, on 
impulse, went into the store and 
bought a pair. The clerk had to 
pick a size at random for him. 
Outside, on the sidewalk, he 
stared at the prettily gift-wrap- 
ped package and finally acknowl- 
edged the tremor, the tension and 
the old ache in the region of his 
diaphragm. 

Relapse! 

He plodded three slushy blocks 
up a side-street before he found 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a cab. He gave Phyllis Sutton’s 
address to the driver and sank 
back in the taxi as a wave of 
weakness overcame him. What if 
she*weren’t home? It was Christ- 
mas Eve. She would probably be 
visiting friends or relatives. 

But she wasn’t. She opened the 
door under his impatient knock, 
and her eyes widened cordially. 

“Sylvester!” she exclaimed. 
“Merry Christmas! Is that for 
me?” She pointed to the package, 
clutched forgotten in his hands. 

“Merry, hell!” he said dispirit- 
edly. “I came to warn you to look 
out for a relapse. Mine’s been 
coming on all day.” 

She drew him inside, made him 
take off his coat and sit down 
before she acknowledged his re- 
mark. The apartment was cozy, 
with a tiny Christmas tree deco- 
rated in the window. She returned 
from the hall closet and sat be- 
side him. 

“Look what I did — on im- 
pulse,” he said and tossed the 
package on her lap. "That’s what 
really turned it on.” 

She opened the nylons and 
looked up at him sideways. 

He continued unhappily, “I 
saw them in a window. Made me 
think of you, and about that time 
the seizure began. I tried to kid 
myself that I was just getting 
you a little token of — of my 
esteem, but the symptoms are al- 
most as bad as before already.” 



A pparently she refused to 
accept the seriousness of the 
situation. Her smile was fatuous, 
he thought, kissably fatuous. 

“Don’t you realize what this 
means?” he demanded. “Peter- 
son and Feldman turned up a 
very distressing fact. Sulfa- 
tetradine deposits out in the en- 
docrines, so a single dose is all a 
person can take. This relapse of 
mine means we have it all to do 
over again.” 

“Think, Dr. Murt! Just think a 
minute,” she urged. 

“About what?” 

“If the sulfa deposits out in 
the very glands it’s there to 
protect, how could you be suffer- 
ing another attack?” 

His arms ached to reach out 
and emphasize his argument!. “I 
don’t know. All I know is how I 
feel. In a way, this is even worse, 
because — ” 

“I know,” Phyllis said and 
perversely moved close to him. 
“My relapse came last Tuesday 
when I bought you a tie for 
Christmas. I sent a blood sample 
over to Ebert Labs right away. 
And do you know what?” 

“What?” Murt asked in a be- 
wildered fog. 

“It was negative. I don’t have 
Murt’s Virus.” She slipped an 
arm around his waist and put 
her head on his shoulder. “All 
I’ve got is Murt himself.”

Oi0*Q3I 



I AST year, when Mt. Everest 
was climbed with perfect 
_J timing for the coronation 
of Queen Elizabeth II, I watched, 
just out of curiosity, whether the 
Soviets might not make a few 
marginal remarks about the feat. 
I more or less expected that either 
Pravda, or else science fiction’s 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



96 



friend, the Literaturnaya Gazy- 
eta, might fire a blast stating that, 
though Mt. Everest had been 
climbed for military purposes by 
two war-mongering capitalistic 
lackeys of Wall Street, it was a lie 
to say that Mt. Everest was the 
top of the world and this planet’s 
highest mountain. The highest 
mountain, they might have gone 
on, is tentatively designated by 
the name of Amne Machin and 
it is, furthermore, in the Soviet 
sphere, located in the Chinese 
People’s Democracy. And if any- 
body climbed it at all, it would 
be proletarians. 

To the best of my knowledge, 
nobody lifted a cudgel or a foun- 
tain pen in Amne Machin’s de- 
fense. Of course the evidence is 
flimsy, for the mountain has only 
occasionally been seen by air- 
plane pilots who guessed that it 
might be 3000 or 4000 feet higher 
than Mt. Everest. That there is 
a very high mountain in North- 
east China is probable because of 
these reports, but there isn’t a 
measurement on record which 
would enable one to establish its 
height, even with considerable 
uncertainty. Nor, in the absence 
of definite information, is there 
any use speculating about it. 

W HAT I do want to point out 
is that the two men who 
stood on the peak of Mt. Everest 
were not farther out in space than 



anybody else had ever climbed. 
This is not said to belittle their 
enormous skill and perseverance. 
It just happens that they became 
the victims of a natural fact. 

If you say that a mountain 
sticks out into space and that one 
mountain sticks out farther than 
another mountain, you can only 
mean that its peak is farther 
away from the center of the 
Earth. But if you use this crite- 
rion, it turns out that the peak of 
Mt. Everest does not stick out 
into space farther than any other. 

Because of the fact that the 
Earth is not a perfect sphere, the 
mountains near the equator reach 
farther into space than the moun- 
tains elsewhere. And there is quite 
a number of respectable moun- 
tains within one degree of latitude 
(north or south) of the equator. 
In Africa, we have the Ruwenzori 
at 16,784 feet and Mt. Kenya at 
17,040 feet. (The somewhat taller 
Kilimanjaro at 19,319 feet is 3 
degrees from the equator.) But 
in the western hemisphere, we 
have the Cotopaxi at 19,498 feet 
and the Chimborazo at 20,702 
feet. 

According to the Smithsonian 
Geographic Tables, the distance 
of a sea-level point near the pole 
from the center of the Earth is 
3949.8 miles or 20,855,121 feet. 
The distance of a sea-level point 
at the equator from the center of 
the Earth is 3963.3 miles or 20,- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



97 



926.062 feet, so that any given 
mountain, if moved from the vi- 
cinity of a pole to the equator, 
would gain 70,941 feet in distance 
from the center of the Earth. 

Therefore, the distance of the 
peak of Mt. Kenya from the cen- 
ter of the Earth is 20,926,062 + 
17,040 = 20,943,102 feet. The 
peak of the Chimborazo is 20,- 

962.062 + 20,702 = 20,946,764 
feet. But Mt. Everest is 28 de- 
grees north of the equator and 
the distance of its peak to the 
center of the Earth works out to 
20,868,676 feet. 

There is an uncertainty of a 
few hundred fqet in this last fig- 
ure, since the sea-level height of 
the mountain is still somewhat 
in doubt. But this uncertainty is 
is only a small fraction of the dif- 
ference between the peak of Mt. 
Everest and the peak of the 
Chimborazo, which is actually 
the point farthest away from the 
center of our planet. 

And even if that mysterious 
mountain in Northeast China 
should turn out to be higher than 
Mt. Everest, it still could not 
compete with Mt. Everest itself 
when it comes to distance from 
the center of the Earth. 

Incidentally, some readers of 
our foreign editions will undoubt- 
edly object that the opening of 
this item is propagandistic, hav- 
ing already done so about 
previous items mentioning the 

98 



Soviets. Every scientist is aware 
that the Soviets use science, 
mainly through their outrageous 
claims of inventions and discov- 
eries, for propaganda purposes, 
which are political in nature. 
These arrogant claims demand 
refutation; dismissing them as 
laughable would be aiding an 
insidious systematic lie. Lysen- 
koism and similar political impo- 
sitions are another matter — 
they’re tragic and I feel only pity 
for Soviet scientists who must 
submit to such nonsense or lose 
their jobs and even their lives. 

Here, in capsule form, is the 
difference in viewpoint: If the 
Chinese mountain proved higher 
than Everest, the Soviets would 
make capital (pun intended) of 
the announcement; we of the 
West would welcome it. 

NEW (OR VERY OLD) 
NUMBERS 

f l^HIS should really be in the 
questions column, but I de- 
cided to move it ahead because 
my answer is quite long. I re- 
ceived a letter from a Mr. Wil- 
liam S. Boyd, obviously with the 
U. S. Air Force although no re- 
turn address is given, which reads 
as follows: “I have read some- 
where that it is possible to base 
arithmetics on systems of 2, 9, 
12, etc. I am under the impres- 
sion that all mathematics were 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



based on 10. I would appreciate 
it if you could clarify this for 
me; at this Air Base, the library 
does not have any material on 
it.” 

Well, this is a big order. To 
begin somewhere, I’ll say first 
that it is not quite correct that 
all mathematics is based on 10, 
the decimal system of counting. 
We do have quite a number of 
leftovers of older, now discarded, 
systems. The one still most 
strongly in evidence is the duo- 
decimal system, which requires 
counting in units of 12. There 
are the expressions dozen and 
gross (a dozen dozens), there are 
a dozen months in the year and 
two dozen hours in the day, a 
dozen inches to the foot, and so 
forth. Another old system seems 
to have been based on 20, which 
probably meant that these peo- 
ple counted by using both fingers 
and toes. The two most frequent- 
ly encountered leftovers of this 
system are “score” in English 
and quatre-vingt (literally 4 
times 20, used for 80) from the 
French. 

There was once a system based 
on 60, which is why we still have 
6 times 60 degrees in a circle. In 
Germany, before the first World 
War, agriculture products were 
often sold by the Mandel, which 
meant 15, indicating that this was 
once the basis of a system of 
counting. 



Even in mathematics itself, you 
do not always stick to the base 
of ten; you have two sets of log- 
arithms, one based on 10 and 
another based on the figure e, 
the numerical value of which be- 
gins 2.71828183. These logarithms 
are known as the “natural logar- 
ithms” and in many cases they 
prove to be far more useful than 
those based on ten. 

TT is correct that we express 
everything, including nat- 
ural logarithms, in the well- 
known decimal system, which has- 
its origin in the fact that we have 
ten fingers. A close examination 
of the decimal system will show 
how we could express it differ- 
ently if we wanted to. When we 
count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, we use 
a different sign for each word. 
But then, when we say ten, we 
suddenly use two signs and write 
10 . 

We have agreed that moving 
a figure one position to the left 
means that this figure is multi- 
plied by ten. The zero just has the 
purpose of indicating that the 
figure has been moved one posi- 
tion. When we see a figure like 
567, we know by training and 
habit that the 5 in this position 
does not mean five but five hun- 
dred and the whole is simply a 
condensed way of writing: “five 
times hundred plus six times ten 
plus seven times one.”

T>UT we could count, as sug- 
gested by F. Emerson An- 
drews in his book New Numbers 
(New York, 1935 and 1944), 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as usual. 
The next figure, the present ten, 
would still be written with just 
one sign; F. E. Andrews suggests 
using the X (the Roman ten) 
and pronouncing it dek. The pres- 
ent eleven would follow, also 
written with one sign — Andrews 
suggests a specially shaped E — 
and pronounced el. The first fig- 
ure requiring two signs to write 
would be the do (from dozen and 
pronounced accordingly) which 
would look like this: 10. 

In this duodecimal system, the 
movement of a sign by one posi- 
tion means that it has been mul- 
tiplied by 12., Consequently the 
duodecimal figure written 100 
would mean a dozen dozens and 
the duodecimal figure 12 would 
be one dozen plus two ones, the 
14 of decimal notation. 

Now what would have hap- 
pened if people had used only one 
hand for counting? Then we 
would have a system based on 
five and requiring only five signs, 
namely 1, 2, 3, 4 and 0. If a 
figure were moved to the left by 
one position, it would mean that 
this figure has been multiplied by 
5, hence the decimal five would 
be written 10. In this “one-hand- 
system,” our six would be writ- 
ten 11. 



I hope these examples show 
that all that is required is a firm 
agreement on what a movement 
by one position is supposed to 
accomplish, whether it is suppos- 
ed to mean multiplication by ten, 
or twelve, or five, or whatever. 

Of course you may agree on a 
system of just two, requiring only 
the signs 1 and 0. Gottfried Wil- 
helm Leibnitz, the mathematician 
and philosopher, insisted that 
such a system had once been used 
by the Chinese. Whether Leibnitz 
was right or not is relatively un- 
important, but this so-called 
binary system is the only one an 
electronic computer can handle 
and for this reason there is now 
much activity with and around 
the binary system. Every problem 
to be solved by the big computers 
first has to be translated into the 
binary system, or else the ma- 
chine can’t handle it. In this 
binary system the figures from 
one to ten would have to be writ- 
ten: 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 
111, 1000, 1001, 1010. 

A quarter of a century ago, be- 
fore there were any electronic 
computers to make this system 
necessary, one Dr. Theodore 
Wolff amused himself by pre- 
senting some everyday informa- 
tion in the binary system. The 
information concerns Mr. Joshua 
Lehmann whose address is 75 
X-Street, Apt. 4 C, and who was 
born in 1879. At the age of 50, 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he was married for 25 years, had 
six children and a yearly income 
of $10,000. In the binary system, 
the address of Mr. Lehmann is 
No. 1,001,011, Apt. 100 C. His 
birth year is 11,101,010,111 and 
during his 11,001 years of mar- 
riage his wife bore him 110 chil- 
dren which he has to feed and 
clothe on a mere $10,011,100,- 
010,000 per year! 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Frequently one hears of fish 
that live at great depths in the 
ocean as having burst while they 
were brought to the surface for 
study. This is supposed to be 
due to the sudden release of pres- 
sure under which they live nor- 
mally. Another point along the 
same lines is a passage in Arthur 
C. Clarke's Childhood’s End 
where an ichthyologist is describ- 
ed as “ peeping through a micro- 
scope into ... a pressure capsule 
containing some specimens of 
deep-sea life, swimming around 
under its normal tons-to-the- 
square - centimeter conditions." 
Water is supposed to be incom- 
pressible, so how could there be 
such a high pressure in the cap- 
sule? And why do the deep-sea 
fish die? 

Lt. P. K. Cranston 
R.C.A.F. 

Trenton, Ontario 
Canada 



It seems to me as if there are 
two different reasons for the 
maintenance of pressure in 
Arthur C. Clarke’s so far hypo- 
thetical pressure capsule and 
damage to the tissue of deep-sea 
fish which are brought to the 
surface. To begin with, when 
books state that water is in- 
compressible, this is not to be 
taken absolutely literally. With 
enough pressure, several tons 
to the square inch, one can com- 
press water by a small fraction 
of one per cent of its surface 
volume. So if one sealed a pres- 
sure capsule 2000 fathoms be- 
low the surface, the pressure 
would be maintained in the cap- 
sule, since the strength of the 
capsule’s walls would substitute 
for the weight of 2000 fathoms 
of water. 

But I do not helieve that this 
explanation applies to the deep- 
sea fish that burst when hauled 
up fast. Cell walls are not steel 
and the tiny amount of expan- 
sion should be easily absorbed 
by them. Even if we make the 
obviously silly assumption that 
the cell walls do not “give,” 
they are not impermeable to 
water. However, the bodies of 
deep-sea fish indisputably are 
often destroyed and torn. This 
is caused not by the very slight 
expansion of the body fluids of 
the fish, but by the gases disolv- 
ed in the body fluids under high

pressure and released as the 
pressure drops. The death of a 
deep-sea fish is then an ex- 
tremely exaggerated case of 
‘‘the bends,” which has the 
same cause.

This is something I had not 
seen mentioned anywhere, 
either. But I felt quite sure that 
there was no reason to keep 
the outward appearance of plu- 
tonium classified, so I queried 
the Atomic Energy Commission. 
The answer might he slightly 
disappointing to many people, 
for the AEC replied that “plu- 
tonium is quite similar to lead 
in appearance.” 

I have read the book about Dr. 
Wernher von Braun s plan about 
a space station, but there is 
something I do not understand. 
Dr. von Braun says at one point 
that the rocket ship from Earth, 
bringing up supplies, would move 
in the same orbit as the space sta- 
tion, but a few hundred feet away. 
The supplies would then be fer- 
ried across. How is this possible? 
According to the tables in the 
book, the third stage of the rocket 



ship, as it gets to the space sta- 
tion, weighs 66.4 tons. The weight 
of the space station is not stated 
anywhere, but it must be well 
over 400 tons. How can these 
two move in the same orbit with 
the same speed if one weighs 
more than six times as much as 
the others? Please explain.

This is a question I have 
been asked repeatedly after lec- 
tures. The answer is that the 
whole question is wrong be- 
cause the orbital velocity (in a 
given orbit) does not depend 
on the weight, or rather mass, 
of the orbiting body. But I also 
know from lecture experience 
that this answer is usually re- 
ceived with a considerable 
amount of distrust, so I’ll try 
to make my readers visualize 
why this is so. 

If you still have the Decem- 
ber 1953 issue of Galaxy on 
hand, you’ll find a reply having 
to do with the motion of our 
moon. I said there that if the 
Moon and Earth were of equal 
mass, both bodies would re- 
volve around their common 
center of gravity, which would 
he halfway between them. But 
since the Moon has a much 
smaller mass than Earth, the 
common center of gravity of the 
two bodies is much closer to 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the center of Earth. 

In fact, this “barycenter,” to 
use the technical term, happens 
to be inside the Earth, a thou* 
sand miles below the surface. 
If you imagine that the di- 
ameter of our moon were only 
216 miles (instead of the 2160 
miles which is the true figure), 
the barycenter of the Earth/ 
Moon system is likely to be a 
short walking distance from the 
center of our planet. 

In short: the smaller the 
mass of the body revolving 
around the Earth, the closer 
the barycenter to the center of 
the bigger body. In the case of a 
space station of a few hundred 
tons, the barycenter of the 
Earth/Space station system will, 
to all intents and purposes, co- 
incide with the center of the 
Earth. In the case of a rocket- 
ship of 66.4 tons, the barycen- 
ter will also coincide with the 
center of the planet. Hence the 
station and the rocketship will 
both he able to revolve around 
the Earth at the same speed in 
the same orbit, even though 
their masses are decidedly dif- 
ferent. But neither of their 
masses amounts to anything 
when compared to that of the 
Earth. 

Is there any truth to the rumor 
that scientists have discovered a 
new planet beyond Pluto?

I haven’t heard any such 
rumor and I doubt that I ever 
will, for such a discovery would 
not he rumored — it would be 
announced. The possibility that 
one or two yet unknown planets 
might mote around our sun be- 
yond the orbits of Neptune and 
Pluto is generally admitted. 

As you may know, the planet 
Neptune was discovered a little 
over a century ago as a result 
of careful calculations based 
on the deviations of Uranus 
from its predicted orbital move- 
ment. This discovery set the pat- 
tern for Pluto, for it was found 
the same way. The surprise was 
that Pluto was much closer to 
the Sun that had been assum- 
ed. Part of its orbit is actually 
inside the orbit of Neptune. 
Pluto also seems to differ from 
the physical pattern that is the 
rule for the outer planets, and 
the thought has been advanced 
that Pluto may once have been 
a third moon of Neptune. 

The general feeling is that 
the “Trans-Neptune” that as- 
tronomers had been hunting is 
still unknown. There are two 
reasons for this assumption: 
Neptune does deviate from its 
calculated orbit in a manner 



indicating an unknown planet 
bigger than Pluto; and a num- 
ber of comet orbits are such 
that they indicate the existence 
of a planet at about twice the 
distance of Neptune from the 
Sun. 

Are there any metals known 
with melting points higher or 
lower than those of tungsten and 
mercury ( which I take to be the 
extremes')? Do non-metals show 
more extreme melting points 
than these metals? 

G. Schwaber 
Binghampton, N- Y. 

Mercury and tungsten (wolf- 
ram) still represent the known 
extremes, the former having a 
melting point of -39° centi- 
grade (-38° Fahrenheit) and 
the latter probably at 3382° 
centigrade (6119° Fahrenheit). 

As for your second question, 
the answer is emphatically yes. 
Helium has a melting point 
somewhere near 1 degree abso- 
lute, while metal carbides have 
higher melting points than 
metals. The highest reported is 
for a mixture of 80 per cent 
tantalum carbide and 20 per 
cent hafnium carbide, which 
was established to be 3930° 
centigrade or 7110° Fahren- 
heit.

Open Warfare 

By JAMES E. GUNN 



Tournament testing had made Jim 
a machine golfer— but he faced 
a player with no nerves at all! 



Illustrated by ASHMAN 



T HE tournament hadn’t 
been conceded, exactly, but 
everybody agreed that Jim 
was the man to beat. Everybody 
— the professionals, the fans, the 
sportswriters . 

Slim Jim Pearson, the hard-luck boy 
with the velvet swing, is finally going 
to cop that U. S. Open crown. Look up 
these words five days from now. 

He’s no longer the Jim Pearson who 
swung eight times at a ball buried in a 
sand trap in 1957, or the Jim Pearson 
who four-putted a green and picked up 
in disgust in 1960 when he could have 
parred in to win. He’s the Jim Pearson 
who has won ten major tournaments 
on the winter circuit, the last five 
straight, and collected $25,000 with a 
sparkling performance of cool, steady 
golf . 



The Open didn’t pay off any- 
thing close to $25,000, of course. 
The extras made up the differ- 
ence. Fame was negotiable — testi- 
monials, articles, books, sporting 
goods contracts. 

Fifty thousand dollars . 

And the money didn’t mean a 
thing. It was just the price tag on 
a girl named Alice Hatcher, who 
was no different from any other 
attractive young girl except that 
Jim Pearson happened to love 
her, and her father happened to 
have uncountable millions of dol- 
lars. Like the marching Chinese, 
while you were counting them, 
more millions were born.

OPEN WARFARE 



T>UDGY Sam Hatcher, who 
would never break ninety, 
concealed his steely mind behind 
a soft face. Only after he was 
trapped, had Jim recognized the 
inflexible purpose and the wily 
cleverness behind it. 

“You’re a good golfer, Jim,” 
Hatcher said, easing off his spik- 
ed shoes with a sigh, “even if you 
can’t teach me anything. We’ve 
been good to you at the Country 
Club. I want you to do some- 
thing for me.” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“Stay away from Alice!” 

“But, Mr. Hatcher!” 

“I won’t have her marrying a 
man who has nothing but co- 
ordination and muscles. When I 
was only your age, I was making 
$50,000 a year. It takes brains to 
do that. Brains get more valua- 
ble. Muscles deteriorate. There’s 
nothing muscles can’t do that a 
machine can’t do better.” 

“You don’t think I could make 
$50,000?” Jim said angrily. 

“I know damn well you 
couldn’t,” Hatcher said. “You 
haven’t got the guts. If you ever 
got within sight of it, you’d blow 
up— like you did in St. Louis.” 
Before Jim had known it, he 
was wrapped up, sealed, address- 
ed and — he feared — headed for 
the dead-letter office. If he could 
make $50,000 in a year, he could 
have Alice — if he could get her 
— with Hatcher’s blessing. If he 



failed — well, he wouldn’t see 
Alice again. 

Jim had had a long time to 
think about it — the better part 
of a year — and to admire the way 
he had been outmaneuvered. Fif- 
ty thousand dollars — a shrewd 
figure. Right at the top of the 
possible. Not impossible, but so 
close to it as to be practically in- 
distinguishable. 

There had been side effects. 
Touring the tournament circuit 
had kept him away from Alice as 
effectively as walls and armed 
guards. And somehow — Jim had 
a good idea how — Alice had 
learned about the bet. A few days 
after Jim had won his first big 
tournament, he got a note. 

I won't be bought and sold. At. 

That was that — or was it? For 
a few days, Jim had been angry 
with a blind anger that cost him 
$5,000. And then he saw a pic- 
ture over a caption that read — 

Industrialist Samuel Hatcher bids bon 
voyage to his daughter, Alice, who 
will spend the next six months study- 
ing in England. 

Jim studied Hatcher’s expres- 
sion of bland triumph. Suddenly, 
his anger became something else 
— something cold and determin- 
ed. Nerves? Temperament? He 
didn’t have any. 

Each long, low, flat drive was 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a fist in Hatcher’s face — each sure 
putt a dagger in his back. The 
prize money rolled in. The tourn- 
aments dropped behind, conquer- 
ed, forgotten. And then it was 
Open time. The bet was almost 
won. And if Hatcher thought he 
couldn’t lose, Jim had a surprise 
for him. 

He would take the whole fifty 
thousand, Jim thought, and lay 
it in front of Alice and say, “I 
wasn’t buying you, I was buying 
the right to tell you that I love 
you.” And if that didn’t work, he 
would set fire to the putting 
greens at night — all 18 of them. 

Maybe Hatcher knew finance 
— but he didn’t know golf, and he 
didn’t know the way of a man 
with a maiden. 

All it took was the U.S. Open. 
And nobody else could keep up 
the pace for four rounds. Jim 
grinned — it was going to be that 
easy. 

And then Saul showed up. 

npHE first hint of disaster came 
at the practice tee. Jim was 
methodically sharpening up his 
No. 1 woods when the spectators 
deserted him. The appreciative 
murmurs died away. Jim looked 
up. The mob had clotted around 
another tee, several hundred feet 
away. Jim waved the caddy in 
and sauntered toward the at- 
traction that had taken the crowd 
away from the man picked to win 



the Open. Not annoyed, not up- 
set — just curious. 

From a knoll behind the other 
tee, Jim got a good view of the 
big, tall golfer. The tanned, im- 
passive features were unfamiliar. 
And then the driver came down 
in a glittering arc. 

Jim pursed his lips in a sound- 
less whistle. He knew all the pro- 
fessionals and most of the top- 
notch amateurs. No stranger 
should have a swing that good, 
that effortless, that grooved. 

But the real shock came when 
Jim followed the smooth arc of 
the glistening ball. Jim’s eyes 
were good, or he might have lost 
it as it dwindled in the distance. 
The caddy stood at least 280 
yards down the fairway, with a 
ball bag in his hands. He didn’t 
move — and the ball dropped right 
in the middle of the sack. 

Accident, Jim thought shakily. 
But it happened a second time 
and a third, and so on until Jim 
lost count. Every club in the 
bag was used with the same in- 
credible accuracy. The caddy 
had a snap job — he didn’t have 
to stoop once. 

Trick-shot artist, Jim told 
himself. Wait until he gets in 
competition. But there wasn’t 
anybody that good. Not even old 
Joe Kirkwood. 

“Quite a spectacle, eh, Jim?” 

Jim knew that brisk, business- 
like voice. He turned. “Hello, 



OPEN WARFARE 



109 



Hatcher.” He tried to keep his 
voice friendly. 

Hatcher was as fat as ever. 
“Must be unnerving to watch 
something like that.” 

“I can stand it.” 

“But will you be able to stand 
it when the going gets rough?” 
Hatcher asked solicitously. “Or 
will you blow up like you always 
do? It would be too bad, just 
when you’re so close.” 

“You haven’t forgotten our bet, 
then?” 

“Of course not, Jim.” He 
chuckled. “I never forget any- 
thing.” 

“You’ve kept close track,” Jim 
said steadily. “What about Alice? 
Has she kept track, too?” 

“I haven’t the slightest idea. 
She’s in England, you know. I 
suspect, however, that she has 
forgotten all about you.” 

“She’ll remember. The next 
four days will remind her.” 

“I suppose so,” Hatcher said 
thoughtfully. “Sadly, I’m afraid. 
Saul will see to that.” 

“Saul?” 

Hatcher nodded toward the 
golfer on the tee. “Saul.” 

Jim’s eyes narrowed. “You 
know him?” 

Hatcher was enigmatic. “I 
brought him here — my own per- 
sonal entry. His first tournament 
was the qualifying round, and 
he’s going to beat you out of the 
Open.” 



Score up another one for Hat- 
cher. “Then he’s got something 
to learn,” Jim said confidently. 

Hatcher turned to watch Saul. 
The clean, crisp smack pf club 
against ball came with clockwork 
regularity. “Just a dumb, coun- 
try boy,” he said. “Never saw a 
golf club until a few months ago. 
But I think he might teach you 
something, Jim.” 

Jim’s gaze drifted irresistibly 
to the golf balls soaring down the 
fairway into the canvas sack. 
That was what he would have to 
beat. 

J IM’S threesome teed off early 
in the morning. Jim felt good. 
A night’s sound sleep had brought 
back his self-confidence. He was 
going to enjoy winning. 

From the moment he drew his 
driver out of the leather bag, he 
knew he was going to have a good 
day. The grip fitted snugly into 
his hand. His flat, thin muscles 
rippled without a twinge. His 
practice swings were loose and 
effortless. 

The crowd was sympathetic. 
That always helped. They want- 
ed to see him burn up the course. 
He had another rooter, too, and 
there was another thousand in 
the bank. An eager young man 
from a sporting goods company 
had talked him into using a new 
golf ball. The company had plan- 
ned a big campaign to advertise

it. Guaranteed to add twenty 
yards to every drive. They 
would like to add, Used by Jim 
Pearson when he won the U.S. 
Open. 

They’d have that chance, Jim 
thought firmly. He knelt to tee 
up his ball. 

“Don’t tighten up yet,” said 
a voice he was coming to know 
too well. “Give the crowd a show 
for its money.” 

Jim turned. “You can’t have 
much confidence in your cham- 
pion, Hatcher, if you have to try 
psychological tricks like this.” 
“All the confidence in the 
world, Jim,” Hatcher said breez- 
ily. “I just don’t take chances. 
You take chances. That’s why 
you always lose.” 

“Don’t be too sure. I haven’t 
lost yet.” 

Hatcher shrugged. “You 
haven’t seen Alice, have you?” 
Jim forced himself to take 
three deep breaths. When he 
stepped up to his ball, he was 
calm. He took a few experimental 
waggles. The crowd sighed as his 
deceptively easy swing sent his 
first drive soaring down the fair- 
way. It was long and straight. 
The slightest hook would send 
the ball scooting down a slope to 
the left behind a clump of trees 
on the 530-yard par-five hole. 

It wasn’t too tough a birdie. 
The next four dropped in par. 
Cameras clicked and whirred. 



The crowd applauded, held its 
breath or groaned in sympathy. 

On the par-five sixth, Jim re- 
laxed and lit a cigarette. It was 
a good day to be playing. The 
sky was an improbable blue — 
the fairway was green and 
springy. Jim took a deep breath 
and smiled at the crowd. They 
liked that. They applauded. 

Jim got his second shock. 

The white flash of a girl’s face, 
the arch of a slim body in a cool 
summer dress . Jim started 
toward her. 

“Al,” he said, then stopped. 
He cursed silently. He was be- 
ginning to see things. 

He tossed his cigarette away 
and ground it into the turf. The 
sixth fell, nevertheless, in birdie 
figures. Three more pars made 
him 34 for the first nine. Not 
brilliant golf, but the kind that 
won tournaments. And two putts 
might have dropped, but hadn’t. 

HHHE second nine was even bet- 
ter. Jim played smoothly, 
confidently. The crowd, that had 
been tense and excited over his 
four birdies and three pars, began 
slipping away at the sixteenth. 
That didn’t bother him. A roar of 
approval drifted faintly over the 
fairway from time to time. On 
the last two holes he got a birdie 
and a par. 

He glanced quickly over the 
card. A 34 and a 32, for 6b on 



OPEN WARFARE 



111 



the eighteen. Six birdies — twelve 
pars. Three more like that should 
win easily. 

The crowd around the eight- 
eenth green opened in front of 
him as he walked toward the 
clubhouse. Strangers reached out 
to shake his hand and pound 
him on the back. Jim smiled for 
them. 

“How was the golf ball, huh?” 
It was the eager young man. 

“Fine,” Jim said. 

“I'll leave a couple of dozen 
with your caddy.” 

“Fine,” Jim said. 

Jim watched his score being 
posted on the big board. Most 
of the field was still out, but he 
was ahead of the closest competi- 
tor by three strokes. As he turned 
away, the crowd at the eighteenth 
green roared. 

That usually meant a hot 
round. Jim waited. Maybe some 
joker had tied his 66. 

A big, tall, bronzed golfer 
plodded silently through the 
crowd. Nobody shook his hand. 
Nobody pounded his back. But 
they looked at him with awe. 
Jim watched him for a moment 
and frowned. 

He turned to watch Saul’s score 
go down on the board, but two 
men were talking behind him. 
One of them was a syndicated 
sports writer. 

“ Wow /” the columnist said. 
“Clockwork — precision! There’s 




112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

113 




never been anything like it. 
Nerves? He never opened his 
mouth.” 

The other man mumbled some- 
thing. 

‘‘Yes, I said it and I’ll take 
it all back,” the writer replied. 
“Saul’s the man to beat, not 
Pearson.” 

Jim flushed, but the other man 
spoke up. “I’ll still bet on Pear- 
son.” 

“And I’ll take all you can 
scrape together. This Saul’s a 
machine — every shot just where 
he wants it. Let me put that 
down before I forget it — Silent 
Saul, the Mechanical Man.” 

Jim looked back to the score- 
board. His eyes flashed quickly 
across the row of precise figures: 

43443434 3—32 

334443344 32—64 

That tied the course record 
and beat him by two. The pro- 
cession of threes and fours was 
fantastic. 

“What’s the matter, Jim?” 
Hatcher said from behind him. 
“You don’t look well.” 

Jim turned, smiling. It was an 
effort, but he made it. “One 
round isn’t a tournament,” he 
said casually. 

Hatcher sighed. “Comfort 
yourself while you can. Saul’s 
just getting warmed up. He’s 
that mythical thing, the perfect 



golfer, but he’s dumb. No brains, 
Jim — no brains at all.” 

J IM stared at the sports-page 
headline and lost all appetite 
for breakfast. 

SILENT SAUL 
THE MAN TO BEAT 

Pearson’s 66 
Places Second 
To Record-Tying 64 

Jim Pearson, the fair-haired boy of 
the tournament circuit, rolled up a 
sparkling 66 for yesterday’s first round 
of the U.S. Open. But only a few 
minutes later. Silent Saul, mystery 
man of the tournament, blazed in . 

Jim set his jaw firmly and 
forced down his bacon and eggs. 
The Open wasn’t over yet. There 
was a lot of golf yet to be played. 
He glanced through his mail. An 
English stamp! England. He rip- 
ped open the letter. 

A girl can change her mind. 
Win the Open — for me. 

Al. 

Jim waited until his breathing 
slowed. He got up, stuffed the 
note in his pocket, sauntered to 
the practice tee. 

So she was in England. But if 
she loved him, why did this one 
tournament matter? What dif- 
ference did $50,000 make? He 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tried to see the situation from 
Alice’s viewpoint and shook his 
head. Maybe Hatcher was right. 
Maybe he wasn’t so smart. But 
there was one thing he was good 
at, one thing at which, when he 
was feeling his best, he was un- 
beatable. 

An hour’s practice went well. 
His hands felt good today, slim 
and strong. That was always a 
sign of readiness. He strolled 
over to the starting tee. 

The crowd was small. When he 
stepped up to his ball, there was 
only a smattering of applause. 
His drive was as straight as the 
day before and longer by almost 
20 yards. 

Jim played grimly and accur- 
ately. From ahead, as regularly 
as a pulse, came roars of approv- 
al. That was Saul, he thought. 
His game became, if anything, 
crisper. 

The crowd . was larger as he 
teed off on number 10. The un- 
derdog, he thought — they always 
pull for the underdog if he’s 
making a game fight. But if he 
appeared to be certain to lose— 
well, they were human. They 
liked to be on the winning side. 

H IS second nine was a dupli- 
cate of the day before — an- 
other 32. But the applause, as he 
dropped the putt on the eight- 
eenth, was perfunctory. 

Jim puzzled over it as he hand- 



ed the putter to his caddy. He 
had equalled Saul’s record-tying 
score of yesterday. Surely Saul 
hadn’t repeated. His luck had 
to run out. 

It was worse than that. It 
was — 

42343434 4—31 

4 4 3 3 3 4 4 31—62 

He had broken the record and 
beaten Jim by two strokes. Jim 
was four strokes down. He turn- 
ed away, his face set and hard. 
He wasn’t even surprised to find 
Hatcher behind him. 

“What have you got to say, 
Jim,” Hatcher inquired. 

What Jim wanted to say was 
unprintable. After a moment, 
however, he forced a smile. 

“That’s better,” Hatcher said. 
“The good old American tradi- 
tion. Good sportsmanship — that 
sort of thing. Bushwash! They 
pay off on winners.” 

“You haven’t seen anything 
yet,” Jim said. 

“You know,” Hatcher said, “I 
was just going to say the same 
thing.” 

Jim brushed past him and 
walked toward the clubhouse. 
There was something terribly 
wrong with the whole setup. In 
real life, things didn’t happen 
like this. People didn’t pop out of 
nowhere and break all records to 
win the Open. Men didn’t take up 



OPEN WARFARE 



115 



the game and become perfect 
golfers in a few months. Hatcher 
had said either too much or too 
little. 

Saul had a weakness. There 
was no perfect golfer. But how 
could Jim find that weakness and 
take advantage of it! 

“Dave,” Jim said. He caught 
the scurrying tournament mana- 
ger by a sleeve. 

“There’s some dispute about 
a penalty,” Dave said, trying to 
get away. 

“When am I supposed to go 
out tomorrow?” 

“Afternoon.” 

“And Saul?” 

“A little later. What is this?” 
Dave scowled. 

“Let me go out in the morn- 
ing,” Jim said. 

“Well, I don’t—” 

“It means a lot," Jim said 
quickly. “I’ve got an appoint- 
ment in the afternoon.” 

“Well,” Dave said, “I don’t 
see how it can hurt . 

“Thanks, Dave. You won’t re- 
gret it.” And, as the official broke 
into a trot Jim added under his 
breath, “But someone will.” 

Hatcher hadn’t been content 
with a simple bet, not even with 
all the odds in his favor. He had 
played all angles and, when he 
was about to lose, had pulled a 
rabbit out of his hat. Any way to 

win. That was a two-sided game, 

also. 



THHE out nine bowed for Jim in 
32 again, as he missed his 
usual birdie on the first hole 
and got it back with a 2 on the 
second. On the back nine, he slip- 
ped a stroke to a 33. But he re- 
fused to blow up under the 
pressure of Saul’s four-stroke 
lead. 

His 195 total broke several 
fifty-four hole records. And yet 
Saul could drop to a 69 to tie. 
Jim had a hunch Saul’s game 
wasn’t going to break. Not today. 

He shook off the reporters, 
gobbled a sandwich and returned 
to the starting tee almost unno- 
ticed. He was lost in a crowd of 
thousands, gathered to see Silent 
Saul blaze to new heights. 

Saul’s effortless swing belted 
the ball over 300 yards down the 
fairway, straight as the shortest 
distance between two points. Jim 
wasn’t watching. His eyes were 
half-closed, studying the mental 
picture of that swing. 

There was something wrong 
with it, something naggingly sus- 
picious about it. Jim couldn’t 
pin it down. It seemed — familiar 
— and yet Jim felt he’d never 
seen it before that first mad day. 

Jim tramped the fairway with 
the rest of the spectators, draw- 
ing close enough to hear anything 
Saul might say to his caddy or 
Hatcher. There wasn’t anything 
to hear. Saul was silent as a 
mute. 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Saul sent one sweeping glance 
toward the green, 240 yards dis- 
tant, selected a club from the 
bag, took a few oddly-familiar 
waggling gestures before he set 
his driver behind the ball and 
swung. The ball lit on the front 
edge of the green and bit. 

Saul’s putt rolled straight for 
the hole until an unruly blade of 
grass deflected it an inch to the 
right of the cup. A birdie. 

That was the pattern. The only 
luck Saul was playing in was 
bad. It rode his shoulders picka- 
back, spoiling the incredible ac- 
curacy of his shots. A gust of 
wind caught a lofting seven-iron 
pitch — a bad bounce called up a 
brilliant recovery — a spectator 
stopped the ball short of the 
green with his head. 

Jim smiled ruefully. Against 
this combination of bad breaks, 
Saul had whipped the front nine 
in 32. 

What would he do when he 
was lucky? 

And still those familiarities of 
swing plagued Jim’s memory. 
Wild ideas flitted through his 
mind — disguise — mass hallucina- 
tion. He pushed them away. This 
was real. And there had never 
been anyone this good. 

The only inconsistency about 
Saul were his unnecessary pre- 
paratory movements. The sports 
writer was right. Saul was a golf- 
ing machine, tuned to perfection 

OPEN WARFARE 



for just one thing. And he did 
nothing else. He didn’t even talk. 

At the start of the eleventh 
hole, Hatcher caught sight of 
him. “Ah,” he said, “come to take 
some lessons?” 

“I hope to learn something,” 
Jim said quietly. 

“Watch Saul — you will.” Hat- 
cher smiled. “Of course, the pa- 
pers will eat this up. ‘Pearson 
watches Saul spike hopes for 
Open.’ ” 

Jim didn’t answer. He was 
watching Saul again. His drive 
cleared the trees to roll to a stop 
close to the green. 

“Where did he learn to drive 
like that?”, Jim mused. 

“Saul?” Hatcher laughed. 
“Why, he’s a natural bom 
golfer!” 

Jim left him laughing and 
puffing far behind. 

H E got his first clue on the 
sixteenth green. Jim scowled 
as Saul drew back his putter in 
a smooth, wrist-powered arc. 
And Jim had part of the answer. 

It might have been Tod Wint- 
ers putting — Tod who was the 
most brilliant putter of the last 
ten years. Frowning, Jim’s nar- 
rowed eyes obscured the physical 
difference, and the form leaped 
out at him. Saul had patterned 
his putting on that of Tod 
Winters. 

No — that wasn’t quite it. It

was like a picture of Tod, every 
idiosyncrasy duplicated without 
reason, superimposed on Saul’s 
massive frame. 

The putt rimmed the cup and 
was dropped for a par. Jim walk- 
ed dazedly with the crowd to the 
next tee. Watching Saul’s drive, 
something sprang into his mind, 
then was gone before he could 
grasp it. 

Jim shook his head and watch- 
ed the long-iron shot arch beauti- 
fully to the green. That one was 
obvious. George Potter, who 
would have been a great cham- 
pion if all his shots had been as 
well played as his long irons, 
was the model this time. 

But again, the things that were 
duplicated were variations that 
added nothing to the success of 
the shots. No golfer in his right 
mind would have duplicated 
those. The waggles and twitches 
were Potter’s way of preparing 
himself psychologically for the 
stroke. 

Why had Saul duplicated ev- 
erything? How had he done it so 
faithfully? 

The crowd’s roar brought Jim 
scurrying to the tree-embraced 
tee to watch Saul’s last drive. 
This time the nagging thought 
leaped again — and stayed. 

He might have been looking 
in a mirror. He should have rea- 
lized it before. Of course, Saul 
would duplicate Jim’s driving 



form. He was the boy with the 
velvet swing, the controlled 
drives that no one had outdis- 
tanced before Saul came along. 

He didn’t even have to watch 
the approach shot. Saul might be 
the golfer, but it would be Gor- 
don Brown’s technique. And then, 
as he watched Saul putt twice for 
a par, the answer came, the an- 
swer that was incredible but, 
somehow — inescapably — true. 

As Jim expected, Hatcher was 
at his elbow with a few well- 
chosen comments. “A 63 — you’re 
six strokes behind with one round 
to go. Do you want to give up 
now?” 

“I don’t think I will,” Jim said 
evenly. “You see, Hatcher, I did 
learn something — something I 
wasn’t supposed to learn.” 
Hatcher was amused. “Yes? 
And what is that?” 

“I think we’d better talk about 
it privately.” 

“Oh, that won’t be necessary.” 
Jim shrugged. “It doesn’t mat- 
ter to me.” He leaned closer to 
Hatcher and added softly, “But 
I know that Saul is a robot.” 

F ROM the clubhouse dining 
room, came sounds of carefree 
confusion — plates and silverware 
clinking, spiked shoes clomping 
across shredded floors, loud 
voices describing this one that 
rimmed or that one that dropped. 
Inside the little private room,

where Hatcher stood looking out 
the window at the rolling, green 
fairway, there was silence. 

A smile curled the corners of 
Hatcher’s mouth. “So you think 
Saul is a robot.” 

“Isn’t he?” 

Hatcher chuckled. “Of course 
he is. How does it feel to be 
beaten at your own game by a 
mindless machine.” 

“You haven’t won yet,” Jim 
said. “A golf ball takes some 
funny bounces.” 

“How did you find out — about 
Saul?” 

“Saul is a lot of things,” Jim 
said slowly, “but none of them is 
Saul. Saul is Tod Winters, George 
Potter, Gordon Brown and me. 
T ake us away and there’s nothing 
left.” 

“Nothing human,” Hatcher 
said. “Just a memory, a power 
source, a lot of wires and a lot 
of motors.” 

Jim shook his head. “How did 
you do it?” 

“Money can do anything. All 
it needs is a purpose. Someone 
has developed a colloidal mem- 
ory bank? That’s a brain — get 
it? The new miniature atomic 
power plant is ideal. Use it. 
Make thousands of tiny motors 
to serve as muscles. Throw in 
some sensory mechanisms, some 
relays, then feed in an analysis 
of a slow-motion pictorial study.” 

“And you have a golf machine.” 



“Exactly,” Hatcher said. 

“It must have cost hundreds of 
thousands of dollars,” Jim said 
bitterly. 

“Closer to a million.” Hatcher 
was cheerful. 

“A million dollars to keep me 
from winning twenty-five thou- 
sand,” Jim said. “Don’t you think 
that’s unfair?” 

“Unfair?” Hatcher echoed, 
smiling. “There’s a machine re- 
sponse for you. That’s what the 
loser always says. Be a little 
better, a little smarter, a little 
stronger than your competitor, 
and he runs to the government, 
yanks on its apron strings and 
screams, ‘Unfair competition. Un- 
fair competition!’ Understand 
this, Jim — nothing’s unfair that 
doesn’t break the rules. And the 
only rule worth remembering is 
this — the best man always wins.” 

“You mean the best machine,” 
Jim said sourly. 

“A machine is only an exten- 
sion of a man, like your driver. 
I don’t happen to be endowed 
with golfing muscles and respons- 
es. You do. Those — and your 
golf clubs, Jim — let you hit a 
ball farther and straighter than 
anybody else. Saul lets me hit a 
ball farther and straighter than 
you do. It’s as simple as that.” 

J IM said, “That wasn’t the bet. 

The bet was that I couldn’t 
make $50,000 in a year. Not that 



OPEN WARFARE 



119 



you couldn’t spend twenty times 
that to keep me from making half 
as much. That was obvious from 
the start.” 

“Maybe that was your bet. It 
wasn’t mine. I bet that I could 
beat you at your own game. I 
didn’t think you were good 
enough for Alice, not smart 
enough, not man enough. Maybe 
you didn't have a chance any- 
way — I don’t know. But she was 
spending too much time at the 
Country Club, and it wasn’t just 
to improve her game. Should I 
let a few well -distributed, well- 
trained muscles blind her to what 
you really are?” 

“And what’s that?” 

“Why, you’re a quitter, Jim. 
You can’t stand pressure. You’re 
no competitor. You’ve proved 
that time after time. Maybe Alice 
couldn’t see it. I had to keep her 
from a foolish mistake.” 

Jim frowned. Maybe it had 
been true. It wasn’t true any 
more — if he could only prove it. 
“And yet I was going to win — 
until you threw your millions 
against me,” he said. 

TTATCHER shook his head. His 
jowls wobbled. “Could I 
let luck give away what I value 
most? Of course not. Alice de- 
serves the best, the smartest, the 
strongest. I knew you were a 
weakling. If you couldn’t win at 
your own game, you couldn’t 



win at anything else. At least I 
gave you that chance.” 

“ Chance !' ’ Jim’s eyes studied 
the floor moodily. 

“Have you ever played poker, 
Jim?” 

Jim looked up. “Sure.” 

“Then maybe you know that, 
over the long run, the smartest 
player always wins. Over the long 
run. You have to give luck time 
to even out. That means the 
winner is the man who can stay 
in the game the longest, the 
one with the most chips. There’s 
a moral in that. Poor men should 
never play poker. Rich men 
should play nothing else.” 

“So you made sure I couldn’t 
win,” Jim said. “All because of a 
preconception that I’m a quitter. 
One ninety-five for 54 holes. I 
don’t call that quitting.” 

Hatcher shrugged heavy shoul- 
ders. “What will you do tomor- 
row, Jim? Or next week? What 
will you do when it’s more than 
just a game, when the going 
really gets rough? That’s what 
it is now. This is for keeps. And 
it isn’t enough just to come close. 
You’ve got to have the will to 
win. Everything is unacceptable 
but victory.” 

“According to my standards, 
Hatcher,” Jim said grimly, “you 
haven’t played fair. Suppose I 
should lose — through no fault of 
my own — and try to win Alice 
anyway?” 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Hatcher’s voice was just as 
grim. “Then I’d know that you 
are a welsher besides a quitter. 
And I’d act accordingly — with- 
out compunctions.” 

Jim knew what Hatcher could 
do if he wanted to. “And suppose 
I should win tomorrow?” 
Hatcher’s face relaxed. “Six 
strokes back? Playing against 
the perfect golfer?” 

“Suppose!” Jim said firmly. 
Hatcher sobered and studied 
Jim’s face. “Then I’d have to 
admit I was wrong. You have my 
word on that. And you could 
have Alice — if she wants you.” 
There was a small sound from 
the doorway. Jim turned. She 
was standing there, cool, slim, 
desirable. 

“A1 . .” he said, and knew that 
he loved her more than ever. 

H OW long had she been there? 

Hatcher turned. “Alice! But 
I got a letter from you this 
morning — from England.” 

Her voice was low and musical, 
as Jim remembered it. 

“I left them with a friend to 
mail for me.” She walked for- 
ward slowly. “I wanted to keep 
myself out of this. I was afraid 
I might disturb something.” 

. “But you should know,” Hat- 
cher said affectionately, “that 
you could never disturb me.” 

“I was thinking of Jim,” she 
said slowly. 



Jim straightened up. He looked 
intently into the face he loved. 

Alice’s red lips twisted ironi- 
cally. “That’s funny, isn’t it? 
And it’s funny to stand here like 
this and talk coldly about some- 
thing that was never put into 
words before. And the funniest 
part is that I wasn’t really in 
love with Jim — not then, not 
really.” 

“A1 . .” Jim began, and stop- 
ped. There was nothing he could 
say. Alice’s blue eyes turned to- 
ward him, and Jim told himself 
that they held a warm promise. 

“It probably wouldn’t ever 
have come to anything, Dad,” 
Alice said quietly. “But then you 
let me find out about the bet. I 
was mad at first, but then I 
started to think. The bet told me 
something. It told me Jim was in 
love with me, enough to make a 
crazy bet like that on the wild 
chance that he might win. That 
was something I had never been 
sure of before, with any man. 
And then you kept us apart. That 
was more. It’s worked for thou- 
sands of years. It worked this 
time. I fell in love.” 

Jim swallowed hard. In a mo- 
ment he would break out singing. 

“You don’t know how I prayed 
and fought every one of his tour- 
naments with him. And, when he 
got so close, I had to be here. I 
had to be near him, even if I 
couldn’t let him know, for fear 



OPEN WARFARE 



121 



that it would upset his game.” 
Hatcher nodded. “I can see 
why you’d be afraid of that.” 
“You’re wrong, Dad,” Alice 
said earnestly. “He’s not a quit- 
ter. He’s proved that. Anybody 
but you would admit it. Sure he’s 
human. He’s not a machine and 
I love him.” 

“Love?” Hatcher shrugged his 
shoulders. “It comes and goes. 
The only thing that doesn’t 
change is character.” 

“You can’t prove that with a 
machine,” Alice said firmly. 

“It’s his own game. Remember 
that. If a machine can play it 
better than he can, he should 
lose. Take away his one ability 
and what have you got? Noth- 
ing!” He turned to Jim. “The bet 
still stands.” He smiled gently at 
Alice. “I won’t let you throw 
yourself away on a childish 
whim.” 

And he stalked out of the room 
with all the delicacy and refine- 
ment of a bull elephant. 

J IM stared at Alice for a mo- 
ment, then took two giant 
strides and gathered her in his 
arms. Eventually, they drew 
apart. 

“Did you mean that?” he ask- 
ed. “About loving me.” 

She nodded, her eyes glisten- 
ing with unshed tears. 

“What can we do?” he con- 
tinued. 



“Nothing,” she said hopelessly. 
“You heard what he said about 
not letting me throw myself 
away. He meant it. He could do 
it, too.” 

“Then I’ve got to beat Saul,” 
Jim said bravely. But he knew, 
while he said it, that he was 
whistling in the dark. He wasn’t 
playing against another golfer. 
He was playing against himself 
— and Tod Winters and George 
Potter and Gordon Brown, the 
best of each. Against perfection, 
he had only his own fallible, er- 
ratic skill. Against machine judg- 
ment and nerveless metal, he had 
to pit the illusioned human sens- 
es and nerves that could, he knew 
only too well, turn to quivering 
jelly. 

“Somewhere,” he said slowly, 
“Saul must have an Achilles heel. 
The prime fact about man is his 
adaptability. An imitation would 
have to have built-in limitations.” 

“That’s it!” Alice said excited- 
ly. “They had to build in at least 
one constant, if not more. If we 
can find it and alter the condi- 
tions . 

“Judgment?” Jim suggested. 
He tossed the idea away. “No- 
judgment has to be flexible. They 
couldn’t know when he’d meet 
up with wind, rain, sunbaked 
courses, slow greens, fast ones, 
wormcasts . 

“He does it, too,” Alice said. 
“I’ve watched him. Maybe we 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could find where he’s kept. Tink- 
er with him — smash him!” 
“That wouldn’t be fair. I could 
probably have him disqualified, 
of course. But that wouldn’t be 
fair either.” 

“ Fair /” Alice exploded. “Has 
Dad played fair? This isn’t a 
game, Jim. We’ve got to win.” 
Jim smiled at the essential am- 
orality of women and sobered. 
“That isn’t what I meant. I mean 
your father wouldn’t accept it. 
According to his lights, he’s play- 
ed fair with me. He could have 
had me crippled, poisoned or 
taken out of action in lots of 
ways — and gotten away with it. 
But he’s beating me on my own 
ground. And that’s where we’ve 
got to beat him.” 

A LICE shook her head. “All 
that skill and energy — wast- 
ed on something like this.” 

“And it could be such a won- 
derful thing,” Jim said. “Profit- 
able, too. Think of the things 
that machines could do, if they 
had memories and self-contained 
power! Not man-shapes, like 
Saul. That’s useless. They could 
do all the jobs that man’s too 
weak to do or that are too dan- 
gerous or too much drudgery.” 
“Mining,” Alice said, “and 
manufacturing.” 

“Exploring — the cold places 
and the hot places. The deeps of 
the sea and space. Rebuilding — 



making uninhabitable places liv- 
able.” Jim’s eyes were distant. 
“The important thing is that 
they can’t compete. Man won’t 
stand for it. He’ll destroy them 
first. And they can never conquer 
Man, because he’s too adaptable. 
Unless he lets them.” 

“That’s wonderful,” Alice said, 
her eyes glowing. “Tell Dad. He 
can recognize a good idea when 
he hears it. He won’t think you’re 
so dumb then.” 

“I could probably like him,” 
Jim said, “except he won’t give 
me the chance. Not unless we 
find the constant. I guess I’ll just 
have to play my heart out to- 
morrow.” 

“You can’t do it, darling. 
You’d have to shoot in the 
fifties!” 

“A golf ball takes some funny 
bounces,” Jim said. He turned to 
the window and stuck his hands 
moodily in his pockets. He start- 
ed. It was as simple as that. 

“There is a constant,” he said 
exultantly, swinging around. 
“Look, Al. Here’s the key to my 
locker. Get my caddy and Saul’s. 
I think you’ll have more luck 
with the boy than I would.' Give 
him — oh, five or ten dollars. And 
here’s what I want you to do . .” 
In the middle of the explana- 
tion, Alice caught fire, too. As he 
finished, she gave Jim a quick, 
proud kiss and hurried out. Jim’s 
eyes followed her admiringly for

a moment, and then he reluctant- 
ly turned toward the dining 
room. 

Jim dragged Dave Simpson, 
the tournament official, protest- 
ingly away from a hearty meal. 
“I've just had a wonderful idea,” 
he said. "Why don’t you put 
Saul and me together for tomor- 
row’s round.” 

“What!” Dave exclaimed. 

“Think of the crowds, Dave,” 
Jim urged. 

“But what about you? What 
chance will you have, playing 
with a man who has you down 
six strokes?” 

“Oh, that’s all right,” Jim said 
bravely. “I don’t mind. But if 
you’re not interested . 

Jim moved to turn away. Dave 
caught him by an elbow. 

“I didn’t say I wasn’t interest- 
ed. If it’s all right with you, I 
don't think anyone else will ob- 
ject.” 

Jim thought of Hatcher. “No,” 
he said, “I don’t think they will.” 

Jim walked away, whistling. 

^T^HE reaction set in when he 
strode onto the tee next morn- 
ing. The crowd was immense and 
noisy. It was all very well to 
plan something like this in the 
abstract. But, in the clutch, 
would his nerve fail him, as it 
had failed him before? 

Alice was waiting for him, cool 
and lovely and infinitely desir- 



able. She put her hand on his 
arm and warmed him with a 
smile. 

On the other side of the broad 
tee, Hatcher’s smile was mock- 
ing. Beside him, Saul, the robot, 
waited impassively. Jim knew 
then that it wasn’t going to be as 
easy as he had thought. 

It wouldn’t be enough to hope 
that he had thrown a wrench in- 
to Saul’s machinery. He would 
have to fight grimly, determined- 
ly. He would have to play the 
greatest game of his life today, if 
he wanted to win. 

The crowd was partisan. Like 
most Americans, they were pull- 
ing for the underdog. Jim knew 
they wanted him to play bril- 
liantly, if only to narrow the gap 
and make the match thrilling and 
that, if he failed to come through 
for them, they would swing to 
Saul. 

Even realizing all this, it warm- 
ed him as they cheered him up 
to the tee — knowing that what 
they really wanted was to see 
golfing history made. God will- 
ing, that was what they would 
see. 

Jim’s drive took a tail-end 
hook. It dived into the rough be- 
hind a clump of trees. He stepped 
back, grimacing. He would have 
appreciated a happier start. 

As Jim watched closely, Saul 
took a ball from his caddy, teed 
it up, settled himself and swung. 



124

125 



The ball sailed straight down the 
fairway, forty or fifty yards be- 
yond the 300-yard marker. The 
crowd gasped. Jim smiled. 

When he saw his lie, the smile 
was wiped away. Sensible golf 
would have been to play it safe, 
out onto the fairway, where he 
could hope to play his third shot 
straight enough for a par. 

Sensible golf wouldn’t win. Jim 
took out his two-iron, sighted 
through a small hole in the trees 
and swung at the almost-hidden 
ball. It whipped through the 
opening and rolled to a stop just 
in front of the green. 

Saul’s easy four-iron shot was 
dead on the pin all the way, but 
the crowd moaned sympatheti- 
cally as the ball hit the back edge 
of the green and hopped into the 
rough. 

Hatcher looked puzzled as he 
stood beside the green. Jim’s 
close approach set up an easy 
putt for a birdie. Saul’s recovery 
was long, and two putts gave 
him a par. 

Jim smiled grimly. That was 
one of the six strokes he needed. 

Jim’s game sparkled — Saul 
kept finding trouble. While Jim 
was getting down in two on the 
next hole, Saul was over the 
green again and back for a par 
three. 

The third hole was shared in 
birdies, the fourth in pars, the 
fifth in birdies again. Then Jim 



eagled the par-5 sixth, and Saul 
played back and forth across the 
green for a 5. 

Four strokes, Jim thought, and 
cast a glance at Hatcher whose 
face was worried and confused. 
Maybe now he was having doubts 
about his perfect machine. 

T>UT Saul matched pars with 
-■-* Jim on the next two, then got 
back a stroke on the ninth with 
a long putt while Jim was scram- 
bling for a par. 

Jim took a long breath as they 
walked to the tenth tee to begin 
the second nine, the crucial nine. 
He had come in with a scorching 
30, while Saul had shot his worst 
nine of the tournament, a 33, 
If Jim hadn’t been terrific, he 
wouldn’t have picked up a stroke. 
It was going to be tough to keep 
up that pace. 

When Alice lit his cigarette for 
him, her hand was shaking. He 
held the hand firmly and looked 
steadily into her eyes. In a mo- 
ment the shaking stopped. 
“Thanks,” she said. 

“Nothing to it,” Jim said, and 
hoped he sounded more confident 
than he felt. 

Jim breathed a little easier 
when Saul’s two-iron bounced far 
down the back edge of the tenth 
green. Jim played it carefully, 
landing on the front edge and 
sticking. Saul took a long re- 
covery shot and two putts for his 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 






first bogey. Jim’s two putts gave 
him a par. He was only two 
strokes behind. 

They shared birdies on the 
eleventh and pars on twelfth. On 
the next, however, Jim got his 
second eagle, with a chip shot 
that dribbled to the lip, trembled 
and finally dropped. Unperturb- 
ed, Saul holed his putt for a 
birdie. 

One stroke behind? Jim mut- 
tered hoarsely to himself. The 
strain was beginning to tell. He 
had to steel himself before each 
shot to keep from trembling. 

They each took pars on 14, 
birdie threes on 15. On the short 
sixteenth, Jim’s 7-iron dropped 

10 feet in front of the pin, Saul’s 

11 feet behind. Saul’s putt was 
straight in. 

Jim’s hand shook as he lined up 
the putt. If he missed this, he 
would be two strokes behind 
again with only two holes to go. 
He could never hope to catch up. 
He jabbed at the ball. It trickled 
off to the right, stopping a full 
foot from the hole. He steadied 
himself and dropped the next. 

For a moment, he could feel 
the old, familiar sense of despair 
and rage creep through him. 
Then Alice put her arm confi- 
dently through his as they walk- 
ed to the seventeenth tee. 
Fiercely, Jim drove his longest 
wood of the day. It still lacked 
30 yards of Saul’s. 



Saul overshot the green by 40 
yards and ended with a par-five. 
Jim calmed himself to make a 
50-foot approach putt stop with- 
in 3 feet of the pin, but left him- 
self a sharp downhill slope. He 
tapped the second one gingerly. 
The ball trickled to the lip and 
dropped with a cheerful thunk. 

He was no Tod Winters, Jim 
told himself wryly, but he had 
his moments. Once more he was 
only one stroke behind. One 
stroke, and one hole to go. Pick 
up a stroke and tie, two strokes 
and win. Win Alice or lose her. 
It was like losing the world. A 
tie would be no good. There were 
excellent reasons why Saul’s 
game wouldn’t be off on the mor- 
row. He had to get two strokes on 
this hole, somehow. 

J IM’S drive sliced behind a 
fringe of trees that divided 
the first and eighteenth fairways. 
Saul’s drive, as usual, was long 
and straight. Jim wiped the 
sweat from his forehead. It was 
pain not to relax, not to quit, 
scream and curse. 

The green was hidden, 130- 
yards away. He had to shoot over 
the trees blind. He swung easily, 
smoothly. The ball cleared the 
trees and dropped from sight. 
He barely heard the smattering 
of applause. 

Jim watched Saul’s approach 
land over the crowd at the back

of the green. Jim walked up 
slowly. When he had forced his 
way through the spectators, he 
saw that his ball had landed on 
the green — but 25 feet from the 
cup. 

The crowd formed a lane for 
Saul’s third shot. It hit the green 
and scooted, coming to rest on 
the front edge. His putt was 
straight for the hole all the way. 
The hush broke into a moan. The 
ball had rimmed. 

Jim figured it up. That would 
give Saul a five. He could win 
with a three. He studied the 
green carefully, noting the slopes, 
the lay of the grass. After a min- 
ute he decided on his line. He 
took his stance. Once more, an 
unnatural silence settled over the 
crowd. 

Jim stroked the ball. It ran 
swiftly at first, then slowing, 
trickling over the last slope, near- 
ing the cup, gently turning. Eter- 
nities passed, and the ball hesi- 
tated on the lip, toppled, 
disappeared. 

The scene was bedlam. Alice 
grabbed his arm with one hand, 
thrust the score-card in front of 
his nose and jumped up and 
down screaming happily. Jim 
steadied the card long enough to 
read the score. Another 30 — a 
60 for the day. A 72-hole total 
of 255. A flock of broken records. 

When the new U.S. Open 
champion walked to Saul’s cad- 



dy and removed the ball from the 
boy’s fingers, Hatcher was at his 
side. He was frowning. 

“How did you do it?” he 
shouted. 

Hatcher had ceased to awe 
Jim. Hatcher was not infallible. 

“Under certain, extremely re- 
stricted sets of circumstances,” 
Jim said, “a machine is better 
than a man. But, over the long 
run, over the gamut of situations, 
a machine doesn’t have a chance. 
It just can’t compete.” 

Hatcher was still frowning. “I 
still don’t understand.” 

“Here,” Jim said, handing him 
the golf ball Saul had been us- 
ing. 

Hatcher stared at it. “This 
isn’t Saul’s regular ball.” 

“That’s right.” Jim laughed. 
“It’s a new one, guaranteed to 
add twenty yards to the average 
drive.” 

Slow understanding crossed 
Hatcher's face. “But that’s un- 
fair,” he said. “That’s . .” He 
began to smile, and the smile 
broke into a chuckle. “I’ll be 
damned!” he said. 

“There are no perfect golfers,” 
Jim said. “There are only good 
ones and better ones/ I’ll be 
around in a few days to talk 
about men and machines — and 
competition. I have $50,000 to 
invest in our new business — mak- 
ing robots — useful robots.”

MUTANT by Lewis Padgett. 
Gnome Press, 1953, $2.75. 

PADGETT’S “Baldy” series — 
four from 1945 and one from 
1953 Astounding — is among the 
most mature, imaginative and 
moving pictures of a post-atomic- 
war world written. The tales tell 
of the struggles of a group of 
hairless telepathic mutants to find 
a way of survival for themselves 
and for the remnants of non- 
telepathic humanity against the 
onslaughts of some paranoid tele- 
paths who want to subjugate 
“normal” humans and then would 



become homo superior. 

Few have so vividly imagined 
what it might be like to be a 
telepath among telepaths, or how 
difficult it would be for a minor- 
ity of them to co-exist with a 
large population of suspicious 
non-telepaths. 

The book leaves one with a 
very poignant realization of the 
humanity of Man and the diffi- 
culties under which he must labor 
to become a truly rational being.

npHIS is the book for anyone 
-*• who wants to learn how to 
write — and sell — science fiction 
and fantasy. The author presents 
everything from an informative 
short history of imaginative fic- 
tion, through a survey of science 
fiction markets and some brief 
biographies of leading s-f writers, 
to a series of chapters on how to 
think up ideas and how to plot, 
write and sell science fiction and 
fantasy. There is a final chapter 
on the pains and pleasures of be- 
ing a writer of imaginative fiction. 

Recommended even for people 
who don’t want to write; it’s 
fascinating reading for anyone 
who is interested in the creative 
process and how to make a liv- 
ing by it. 

THE GREEN MILLENIUM by 
Fritz Leiber. Abelard Press, 1953, 
$2.75. 

¥ CAN only report that I found 
-*■ this original novel creepily 
fantastic (an odd word to use in 
connection with science fiction, 
perhaps?), though very readable. 

It tells of another world of to- 
morrow in which government and 
crime are allied and the people, 
frenetic, aimless and desperately 
degenerate, are primarily titivat- 
ed and kept happy by phony sex 
entertainment. 

Enter a green cat (and some 
other odd individuals) from outer 



space. The cat has the ability to 
make everybody around him hap- 
py, by means of a sort of hor- 
monal discharge from his tongue. 
Both government and criminals 
consider the cat a threat to their 
power and try to get control of 
it in rather excessively bloody 
ways; but in the end everything 
comes out all right.

Tyr O doubt about it, space travel 
is the coming thing — in best 
sellers, anyhow, as the flood of 
new popularizations indicates. 

The Viking book, with its 12 
magnificent color plates by Bone- 
stell, Klep and Freeman, is just 
as beautiful, authoritative and ex- 
citing as its predecessor, Across 
the Space Frontier, which came 
out last year. Designed for afici- 
onados, it is a breath-taking bar- 
gain in every way. 

Mr. Leonard’s volume is excel- 
lent for the uninformed though

sophisticated audience, and also 
has much for the already indoc- 
trinated among us, particularly in 
its description of the enormous 
difficulties still to be overcome be- 
fore space flight can be achieved. 
His discussion of the possibilities 
of life on other planets in our 
and other solar systems in judici- 
ous, and the whole book deserves 
praise for its clarity. 

The Gnome book is a fascinat- 
ing collection of pictures of vary- 
ing value, plus text (of equally 
varying value) by everybody 
from Willy Ley to Hugo Gems- 
back. It’s a weird miscellany 
(there are even chapters on Fly- 
ing Saucers and on the science in 
science fiction), but generally an 
exciting one. 

Miss Bendick’s book, for chil- 
dren from 7 to 10, is first rate in 
every way, even scientifically. It 
was checked by Dr. Hugh Rice, 
of the Hayden Planetarium in 
New York. Delightfully illustrat- 
ed with drawings by the author. 

STAR SCIENCE FICTION, 
VOL. 2. Edited by Frederik Pohl. 
Ballantine Books, 1954, $2.00 
cloth, 35c paper. 

t|^HE second Pohl collection of 
never-before-published science 
fantasies contains 14 items, of 
which three (Bester, Sturgeon, 
Sheckley) are superb; six (Cle- 
ment, Bixby, del Rey, Boucher, 



Kornbluth, and a new writer by 
the name of Robert Crane) are 
very good, and five range from 
acceptable to poor, with only one 
rating the latter score. 

The book is not quite up to the 
first in the series, though, per- 
haps because of the monotonous 
tone of gloom in most of the tales. 
Except for the items by Sturgeon, 
Clement, Boucher, and a charm- 
ing though minor sketch by 
Fletcher Pratt, everything in the 
volume is hag-ridden. Neverthe- 
less, definitely worth 35c! 

ST ARM AN JONES by Robert 
A. Heinlein. Charles Scribner's 
Sons, 1953, $2.50. 

rpHEORET I C ALL Y, this is a 
juvenile. But a juvenile by 
Bob Heinlein — especially this 
one — is better than much of the 
so-called adult science fiction 
novels of these days. Make no 
mistake, this is not kid stuff : it 
is a richly textured and thorough- 
ly mature tale of travel between 
the stars. 

All the people in the book are 
wholly human, with all the faults 
and frailties that make humans, 
except for the fact that Jones, 
the young hero, has a pretty 
fancy eidetic memory which sets 
him above ordinary folk. But this 
also makes the story what it is, 
a thrilling narration of the fortui- 
tous climb of a farmer’s son to

the rank of temporary captain of 
an interstellar liner. Without his 
abilities, he never would have 
made it. 

I would say that this is the 
best of Heinlein’s juveniles, of 
which there are now seven.

TTERE. on the other hand, is a 
boys’ book that is All Boy. 
Not that adults won’t enjoy it, 
too, but it is almost entirely con- 
ceived in the straight gee-whizz 
adventure technique that is the 
classical pattern for teen-age ac- 
tion stories. 

The story tells how young 
David (“Lucky”) Starr manages 
to frustrate the attempts of the 
Sirians to establish themselves 
secretly in the Asteroid Belt in 
our own solar system, so that they 
eventually could conquer us. It 
will give young people a lot of 
very lively daydreams — but no 
nightmares, not being as cruel 
and bloody as Paul (Isaac Asi- 
mov) French’s first one, David 
Starr, Space Ranger, was. Excel- 
lent for the Junior Set. 

EXPEDITION TO EARTH by 
Arthur C. Clarke. Ballantine 
Books, 1953. $2.00 cloth, 35c 
paper 



ARTHUR CLARKE’S second 
Ballantine book in five 
months is a collection of 1 1 of his 
short stories. Although five have 
already been anthologized else- 
where, it still is a pleasure to 
have a bunch of high-grade 
Clarke all in one place. 

The stories are continuously 
fascinating, from the beautiful 
and imaginative “Second Dawn” 
that opens the collection to the 
shockingly tragic “Breaking 
Strain” (previously anthologized 
as “Thirty Seconds — Thirty 
Days”). They cover most of the 
major types of modern science 
fantasy, too, thus exhibiting their 
author’s versatility. 

LOOKING FORWARD, edited 
by Milton Lesser. Beechhurst 
Press, 1953, $4.95 

fT^HIS most expensive of all 
-*• science fiction anthologies yet 
published contains 20 stories, of 
which 7 have already appeared 
in other collections. 

Of the previously anthologized 
stories, I liked those by Leinster, 
Bradbury (it’s “The Fire Bal- 
loons,” though called “In This 
Sign” here), Asimov, Anderson 
and del Rey; of the unantholog- 
ized ones, Chad Oliver, Stephen 
Marlowe and a curious, badly 
written and plotted story by Don 
Wilcox which nevertheless has & 
historic importance since it pre-

dates both Heinlein’s famed 
“Universe” and van Vogt’s equal- 
ly renowned “Far Centaurus” in 
its science fiction ideas. 

The rest of the stories range 
from run-of-the-mill all down the 
way to terrible. 

COSTI GAN'S NEEDLE by Jer- 
ry Sohl. Rinehart & Co., 1953, 
$2.50 

OOHL’S third fantasy is con- 
^ siderably better than his first 
two. The first half, describing the 
making of a device through which 
people can pass to a parallel 
world, is exciting and quite vivid ; 
but the latter half, when a group 
of humans set about establishing 
a society in that world, is some- 
what unsatisfactory. The point 
(or moral) of the tale is more 
impressive and moving than its 
telling, and you may find it worth 
while reading it just to get that 
point. 

¥>RIEF NOTES: Certainly the 
most distinguished book of 
short stories of 1953 was Roald 
Dahl’s Someone Like You 
(Knopf, $3.50), which contained, 
among other marvels, “The 
Sound Machine,” a famous piece 
of semi-science fiction from the 
anti-science fiction New Yorker, 
and an awe-inspiring fantasy- 
satire called “The Great Auto- 
matic Grammatisator” — an 



unforgettable bit of biting 
nonsense. 

There is also “The Skin,” a 
hair-curling slice of macabre, and 
many other goodies, not all sci- 
ence fiction or fantasy, but all 
superb. 

It is good to see the novels of 
A. Merritt in clothbound editions 
again. Liveright is doing them 
two to a big fat volume, at only 
$2.75 each. The first contains 
Seven Footprints to Satan and 
Burn Witch Burn! and the sec- 
ond one Dwellers in the Mira&e 
and The Face in the Abyss. Let’s 
hope the rest are reissued the 
same way. 

Don’t miss Alfred ( Demolish- 
ed Man ) Bester’s savage picture 
of television production in his 
non-s-f “ Who He?" (Dial, $3.50). 
It scarifies the Madison Avenue 
crowd in New York that is re- 
sponsible for all that TV non- 
sense. 

Fritz Leiber’s Conjure Wife 
now available separately in cloth 
(Twayne, $2.75) and paper (Lion 
Books, 25c). 

A. E. van Vogt’s “The Shadow 
Men” ( Startling Stories, 1950) 
is now out under the title Uni- 
verse Makers, coupled with The 
World of Null-A in an Ace Book 
paperback double at 35c. The 
former has been rewritten full of 
L. Ron Hubbard’s “scientology” 
— but it’s still good reading.

“Yes, and every morning he

children. I won’t go on like this! 
You must go out and talk some

sense into him about removing it 
at once.” 

“I don’t know,” George said 
weakly. “They might not be 
happy to find out about us.” 
“Well, our being here is their 
own fault, remember that,” Clara 
snorted. “They deli verately expos- 
ed your great-great grandfather 
Michael to hard radiations. 
George,” she continued fervidly, 
“all you have to do is to go out 
and ask him. I’m sure he’ll agree, 
and then we’ll have this menace 
removed from our lives. I simply 
can not go on like this another 
minute!” 

That, George knew, was a mis- 
statement. She could go on like 
this for hours. He stared at her 
unhappily. 

“Yes, dear,” he mumbled final- 
ly. “Well, maybe tomorrow.” 
“No, George,” she said firmly. 
"Now! This morning. The very 
moment he comes in.” 

He looked at her silently, feel- 
ing harried and unsure of himself. 
After living here so long, they’d 
observed and learned human cus- 
toms and speech — they’d even 
adopted human names. 

“George,” she pleaded, “just 
ask him. Reason with him. Point 
out to him that he’s just wasting 
his time. She paused, added, 
“You’re intelligent — you can 
think of the right things to say.” 
“Oh, all right,” he said wear- 
ily. But once he had said it, he 



felt better. At least, he would get 
it over with, one way or another. 

A S soon as he heard the swish- 
swish of the broom outside 
his home, he got up and walked 
out of the front door. He saw 
that the trap was still off to one 
side, where he had pushed it the 
night before. 

“Hello,” he shouted. 

Swish - swish - swish went the 
broom, busily moving dust from 
one part of the room to another, 
swish - swish - swish. The man 
looked tremendous from so close 
a view, yet George knew that he 
was just a little, bent, old man, a 
small specimen of the species. 

George took a deep breath. 
"Hello!" he bellowed with all his 
strength. 

The janitor stopped swish - 
swishing and looked around the 
room suspiciously. 

“ HelloP’ George shrieked. His 
throat felt raw. 

The janitor looked down and 
saw the mouse. “Hello yourself,” 
he said. He was an ignorant old 
man and, when he saw the mouse 
shouting hello at him, he assumed 
right away that it was a mouse 
shouting hello to him. 

"The trap!" the mouse bellow- 
ed. 

“Stop shouting!" the janitor 
cried, annoyed. He liked to think 
as he worked, and he hated loud 
noises. "What about the trap?” 



CHAIN OF COMMAND 



135 



“My wife doesn’t want you to 
put it by the front door any 
more,” George said, still speak- 
ing loudly, so that the janitor 
could hear, but at least not bel- 
lowing so that it tore his throat. 
“She’s afraid it might hurt the 
children.” 

“ Will it hurt the children?” the 
janitor demanded. 

“No,” George replied. “They 
know all about traps — but my 
wife still wants it removed.” 

“Sorry,” the janitor said, “but 
my orders are to put a trap by 
every mousehole. This is an 
atomic plant, and they don’t 
want mice.” 

“They do, too!” George said 
defiantly. “They brought my 
great - great - grandfather Mich- 
ael here themselves and exposed 
him to hard radiations. Other- 
wise I wouldn’t be here.” 

“I can’t help it," the janitor 
snapped. “I have to obey or- 
ders.” 

“What will I tell my wife?” 
George shouted. 

That stopped the janitor. He 
had a wife of his own. 

“I guess I can take it up with 
the supervisor,” he finally said. 

“All right,” George shouted. 
"Thanks!” 

*T1HE janitor picked up the trap 
and moved it over to the front 
door. He watched, interested, as 
George promptly pushed it sev- 



eral inches along the wall. Then 
he turned and busily swish-swish- 
ed more dust around the room. 

“Well, what did he say?” Clara 
asked George as soon as he came 
back into the house. 

“Said he’d take it up with the 
supervisor,” George said, settling 
down in an armchair. 

“George,” she ordered, “you get 
up this instant and make sure 
that he really does!” 

“Look,” George pleaded, “he 
said he would.” 

“He may have been lying,” 
Clara said promptly. “You go 
right up to the supervisor’s room 
and see.” 

So, George reluctantly heaved 
himself out of the chair and ran 
through the mouseways in the 
wall until he came to the mouse- 
hole in the supervisor’s room. 

At that moment, the janitor 
came in and the supervisor look- 
ed up, annoyed. He was a fat 
man, with stubble on his cheek, 
and he walked with a waddle. 

“There’s a mouse in room 112 
who doesn’t want a trap by his 
front door,” the janitor said sim- 
ply- 

"You’re crazy,” the supervisor 
said. 

The janitor shrugged. “What 
should I tell him?” he asked. 

“Tell him to come up here 
and speak to me himself,” the su- 
pervisor said, feeling very clever. 

“I’m right here,” George cried, 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stepping out of the mousehole 
and neatly side-stepping the 
mousetrap beside it. 

“There he is now,” the janitor 
said, pointing. 

“My God!” whispered the su- 
pervisor, who’d had some educa- 
tion. “A hallucination.” 

“No, a mouse,” the old jani- 
tor corrected. 

“My wife wants the trap 
removed,” George patiently ex- 
plained. “She’s worried the chil- 
dren might blunder into it.” 
“Do you see him, too?” the 
supervisor asked the janitor in- 
credulously, still whispering. 

"Sure,” the janitor replied. 
“He’s the one I was telling you 
about, from room 112.” 

The supervisor stood up un- 
steadily. “I don’t feel very well,” 
he said in a weak voice. “I think 
that I’d better talk this over 
with the Administrative Officer. 
It’s a policy matter.” 

“You come along, too,” he said 
hastily to the janitor, who had 
turned to leave. “I’ll need all the 
support I can get.” He waddled 
out, followed by the janitor. 

“ What should I tell my wife?” 
George shouted, but they didn’t 
answer, so he went down and told 
his wife that they were discussing 
it with the Administrative Officer. 
And, as anyone could have guess- 
ed, a short time later he pushed 
his head out of the mousehole in 
the Administrative Office. 



TTE was a bit late, just in time 
-■••■■to see the door close on the 
supervisor and the janitor. 

So he shouted, “Hello!” as loud 
as he could. 

The Administrative Officer 
looked down and saw him right 
away. He was a thin pale man 
with tired eyes. 

“Go away,” he said spiritlessly, 
“I’ve just told two people that 
you don’t exist.” 

“But my wife wants that trap 
removed — it’s dangerous for 
the children,” George complain- 
ed. 

The Administrative Officer al- 
most shouted to hell with 
George’s children, but basically 
he was a decent man, even if an 
overworked one, and he caught 
himself in time. 

“I’m sorry,” he said sincerely, 
picking up some letters that he 
had already read, “but we’ve got 
to leave the traps.” 

“Then what will I tell my 
wife?” George demanded. 

That stopped the Administra- 
tive Officer, too. He buried his 
head in his hands and thought 
for a long moment. “Are you sure 
you really exist?” he asked, final- 
ly raising his head from his 
hands. 

“Sure,” George said. “Do you 
want me to bite you to prove 
it?” 

"No, you needn’t bother,” the 
Administrative Officer said. And 



CHAIN OF COMMAND 



137 



then he buried his head in his 
hands again. 

“Technically,” he said, speak- 
ing through his fingers, “it’s a 
security problem.” 

With an air of relief, he picked 
up the phone and called the Se- 
curity Officer. There was a bit of 
spirited conversation and then he 
hung up. 

“He’ll be right down,” the Ad- 
ministrative Officer told George. 

Shortly thereafter, the door 
violently swung open, and a tall 
man with piercing eyes entered. 
“Hello Bill,” he said quickly. 
“How are you feeling?” 

“Hello, Mike,” the Adminis- 
trative Officer replied. “I feel like 
hell. This is George. I just call- 
ed you about him.” 

“Hello!” George shouted. 
“Hello!” the Security Officer 
shouted back. “I couldn’t find 
any record of you in the files. 
Have you been cleared?” he add- 
ed with a note of urgency in his 
voice. “Fingerprints, A. E. C., 
C. C. C., C. A. I., F. B. I.?” 

“No!” George shouted back. 
“My wife wants the trap by our 
front door removed. She thinks 
it’s dangerous for the children.” 
“Has she been cleared?” the 
Security Office countered in a 
loud voice. 

“Why is everybody shouting?” 
the Administrative Officer asked 
peevishly. “I’ve got a headache.” 
“No,” George answered. 

138 



HTHE Security Officer’s mouth 
tightened into a thin, grim 
line. “A major lapse of security,” 
he snapped. “I’ll check into this 
very thoroughly.” 

“Will you remove the trap?” 
George asked. 

“I can’t, until you’re cleared,” 
the Security Officer said, shaking 
his head. “I certainly won’t au- 
thorize any action that could be 
later construed as aiding the en- 
trance of spies or subversives into 
the plant.” 

“How old are you?” the Ad- 
ministrative Officer asked George. 

“Fifty-six days,” George re- 
plied without hesitation. 

“Under twelve years,” the Ad- 
ministrative Officer pointed out to 
the Security Officer. “No clear- 
ance required.” 

“I don’t know,” the Security 
Officer said, shaking his head. 
“There’s no precedent for a case 
like this. I’ll be damned if I'll 
stick my neck out and have that 
trap removed. I know, I’ll send 
a request for an advisory opin- 
ion.” He turned and walked to- 
ward the door. 

“What should I tell my wife?” 
George called after him. 

“Tell her that I’m asking the 
A.E.C. for an opinion, with car- 
bon copies to the Defense Dept, 
and the F.B.I.” 

“Don’t forget Immigration & 
Naturalization,” the Administra- 
tive Officer said. “There might be 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a question of citizenship.” 

‘‘The hell there is,” George said. 
“Lex tods — I was born here.” 
“Well,” the Security Officer 
said as he walked out, “one can’t 
be too careful.” 

So, George went and told his 
wife and, the next morning, he 
was on the train for Washington. 
Being telepathic, as all this gen- 
eration of mice were, he already 
had contacted some mice who 
had an ‘in’ in the government 
buildings. 

All the way down on the train, 
he worried about chasing all those 
carbons in the bureaucratic maze 
of Washington, but he needn’t 
have. 

As soon as the Security Offi- 
cer’s report was received, the 
A.E.C. sent a battery of psychia- 
trists to the plant. After the psy- 
chiatrists reported, they, in turn, 
were sent to another battery of 
psychiatrists. After that, the 
A.E.C. called a top-level confer- 
ence of the Defense Dept., F.B.I. 
(Dept. Just.), Fish & Wildlife 
(Dept. Int.), Public Health 
(Dept. Welf.), Immigration & 
Naturalization and Alaskan Af- 
fairs. The latter turned out to be 
a mistake. 

fT^HIS had taken two weeks, 
and George had lingered in 
the walls, impatiently waiting for 
his chance to testify. Of course, 
he was in telepathic communica- 

CHAIN OF COMMAND 



tion with Clara. He knew that his 
family were all well, that Clara 
had made friends with the janitor, 
also that the trap was still there. 

The janitor no longer put 
cheese in it, and he didn’t set the 
spring any more, but he still fol- 
lowed his orders and so, every 
morning, moved it back by the 
door of the little mousehouse. 

A fat Washington mouse guid- 
ed George to the mousehole in the 
conference room. George looked 
inside and sniffed the smoky air 
distastefully. 

There were seven men seated 
at a long table, with a glass of 
water in front of each. This was 
a liquid that even George knew 
was hardly designed to lubricate 
the way to a quick agreement. 

“ Bomb them, I say,” the Gen- 
eral cried, smashing his fist down 
on the table. “Hit them hard with 
atomic weapons. Hit them now, 
before they have a chance to 
strike first.” 

“But that’s one of our best 
plants,” a civilian from the A.E.C. 
protested. “We don’t want to 
blow it up, not for a few paltry 
mice.” 

“Couldn’t we send them to 
Alaska?” the man from Alaskan 
Affairs asked timidly, wondering 
what he was doing there. 

“How about traps?” the man 
from Fish and Wildlife said. “We 
have some honeys.” 

“But that's just it!" George 

139 



said in a loud voice, and they 
all turned to look at him. “My 
wife would like that trap by our 
front door removed. She’s afraid 
that it might hurt the children.” 

“ Who are you?" the man from 
Immigration & Naturalization 
demanded sharply. 

“I’m George,” George said. 
“It’s my house that has the trap 
in front of it.” 

“What are you doing here?" 
the man from the F.B.I. demand- 
ed. “Spying on a closed meet- 
ing!” 

"I’m not spying!” George ex- 
claimed. “I just came to ask you 
to please remove the trap.” 

rpHE man from the F.B.I. look- 
ed at him with something 
close to pity. “It’s not that simple 
any more,” he said. “Don’t you 
realize what a threat you com- 
prise?” 

“No,” George said, scampering 
up the leg of the table and walk- 
ing to its center. “We’re not a 
threat to anybody. We’re just 
mice. It’s not our nature to be a 
threat to anybody.” 

Then, as he looked around the 
table at the seven huge faces that 
surrounded him, he immediately 
saw that they were all scared half 
to death because he was a mouse, 
and he had a sudden premoni- 
tion that he would not come out 
of the meeting alive. So he open- 
ed his mind to let his family and 



all the other telepathic mice hear 
everything that was happening. 

“Don’t tell me you don’t fully 
realize,” the Fish and Wildlife 
man demanded sarcastically, try- 
ing to hide his terror beneath a 
blustering tone, “that from one 
mouse, your great-great-grand- 
father Michael, there must be 
now at least twelve billion de- 
scendants — or six times the hu- 
man population of Earth!” 

“No, I didn’t know,” George 
said, interested despite himself. 

“Don’t tell me it never oc- 
curred to you,” the man from 
the F.B.I. said, shaking a finger 
at him, while George could see 
that he kept the other hand on 
the revolver in his pocket, “that 
you mice have access to and 
could destroy every secret file 
we have!” 

“No. it didn’t,” George said, 
shrinking from that huge, shak- 
ing finger. “We mice would never 
destroy anything uselessly.” 

“Or that you could cut the 
wires on any plane, tank, vehicle, 
train or ship, rendering it com- 
pletely inoperable!” the General 
broke in, slamming a meaty palm 
down on the table so hard that 
George was thrown over on his 
back. 

“Of course it never occurred to 
me!” George said, climbing rock- 
ily back on his feet. “We mice 
wouldn’t think of such a thing. 
Don’t be afraid,” he pleaded, but 



140

it was no use. He could feel the 
panic in their breasts. 

“Didn’t you ever consider that 
you could cut every cable, tele- 
phone line, power line, and tele- 
graph line from the States to 
Alaska?” the man from Alaskan 
Affairs said, just for the sake of 
saying something. Then, to show 
his bravery and defiance, he took 
his glass of water and emptied it 
on George. It was ice water, and 
poor George, dripping wet, began 
to tremble uncontrollably. 

"I suppose you never consid- 
ered that you could sabotage and 
blow up every atomic plant we 
have,” the man from the A.E.C. 
said, before George even had a 
chance to answer Alaskan Af- 
fairs. And, working himself into 
a rage to overcome his fear, he 
emptied his glass of ice water on 
the trembling mouse. 

l^EORGE began to weep. “It 
never occurred to me,” he 
sobbed. “We mice aren’t like 
that.” 

“Nonsense!” the General said.' 
“It’s the unchanging law of na- 
ture. We must kill you or you will 
kill us. And we’ll start by kill- 
ing you!” The General roared 
louder than all the rest because he 
was the most frightened. 

His hand, huge and terrible, 
swept swiftly down on poor, wet, 
weeping George. But the General 
really didn’t know mouse tactics 



very well, because George was 
down the leg of the table and 
halfway to the mousehole before 
the huge hand struck the table 
with a noisy bang. 

And poor George, frightened 
half out of his wits, scooted into 
the mousehole and ran and ran 
without stopping, through the 
mouseways as fast as he could, 
until he reached the train. But, 
of course, the train was no longer 
moving. All the telepathic mice 
had cut every cable, telephone 
line, power line and telegraph line, 
had also cut the wires on every 
plane, tank, vehicle, train and 
ship. They also had destroyed 
every file in the world. 

So George had no alternative 
but to walk back to the plant, 
which had been preserved as a 
memorial to great - great - grand- 
father Michael. 

IT took him three weary weeks 
to make it, and the first thing 
he noticed when he got there was 
the trap in front of the door. 
Naturally, there was no bait in it 
and the spring wasn’t set, but 
the trap was still there. 

“George,” Clara said to him 
the moment after she kissed him, 
“you must speak to the janitor 
about the trap.” 

So George went outside right 
away, since he could hear the 
janitor swish-swashing the dust 
around. 



CHAIN OF COMMAND 



141 



"Hello!” he shouted. 

"Hello yourself," the janitor 
said. “So you’re home again." 

"My wife wants the trap mov- 
ed,” George said. “She’s afraid 
the children might get hurt.” 

"Sorry," the janitor replied. 
“My orders were to put a mouse- 
trap by each mousehole." 

“How come you didn’t go away 
with all the other people?" George 
shouted up at him. 

“Stop shouting,” the janitor 
said. Then, “I’m too old to 
change," he added. “Besides, I 
have a farm down the road." 

"But haven’t they stopped pay- 
ing you?" George demanded. 

“What’s the difference," the 
janitor countered, “money can’t 
buy anything any more." 

“Well, what will I tell my wife 
about the trap?" George asked. 

The janitor scratched his head. 



"You might tell her that I’ll take 
it up with the supervisor, if he 
ever comes back." 

So George went inside and told 
Clara. 

“George," she said, stamping 
her foot, “I can’t go on with that 
trap out there! You know that 
supervisor won’t come back, so 
you’ve got to go out and find 
him." 

George, who knew that there 
weren’t many people around any- 
where any more, walked over to 
his favorite easy chair and sat 
down. “Clara," he said, as he 
picked up a book, "you can leave 
or stay as you wish, but there is 
nothing more that I can do. I’ve 
wasted a full month over that 
trap without accomplishing a 
single thing, and I’m not going to 
start that business all over again."

HE awoke, and didn’t even 
wonder where she was. 
First there were feelings 
— a feeling of existence, a sense 
of still being alive when she 
should be dead, an awareness of 
pain that made her body its 
playground. 

After that, there came a 
thought. It was a simple thought, 
and her mind blurted it out be- 
fore she could stop it: Oh, God, 
now I won't even be plain any 
more. I'll be ugly. 

The thought sent a wave of 
panic coursing through her, but 
she was too tired to experience 
any emotion for long, and she

soon drowsed off. 

Later, the second time she 
® awoke, she wondered where she 

was. 

There was no way of telling. 
Around her all was black and 
quiet. The blackness was solid, 
the quiet absolute. She was aware 
of pain again — not sharp pain 
this time, but dull, spread 
throughout her body. Her legs 

BEDSIDE MANNER 143 




ached; so did her arms. She tried 
to lift them, and found to her 
surprise that they did not re- 
spond. She tried to flex her fin- 
gers, and failed. 

She was paralyzed. She could 
not move a muscle of her body. 

The silence was so complete 
that it was frightening. Not a 
whisper of sound reached her. 
She had been on a spaceship, but 
none of a ship’s noises came to 
her now. Not the creak of an 
expanding joint, nor the occa- 
sional slap of metal on metal. Not 
the sound of Fred’s voice, nor 
even the slow rhythm of her own 
breathing. 



It took her a full minute to 
figure out why, and when she had 
done so she did not believe it. 
But the thought persisted, and 
soon she knew that it was true. 

The silence was complete be- 
cause she was deaf. 

Another thought: The black- 
ness was so deep because she was 
blind. 

And still another, this time a 
questioning one : Why, if she 
could feel pain in her arms and 
legs, could she not move them? 
What strange form of paralysis 
was this? 

She fought against the answer, 
but slowly, inescapably, it formed 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




in her mind. She was not para- 
lyzed at all. She could not move 
her arms and legs because she 
had none. The pains she felt were 
phantom pains, conveyed by the 
nerve endings without an external 
stimulus. 

When this thought penetrated, 
she fainted. Her mind sought in 
unconsciousness to get as close 
to death as it could. 

W HEN she awoke, it was 
against her will. She sought 
desperately to close her mind 
against thought and feeling, just 
as her eyes and ears were already 
closed. 



But thoughts crept in despite 
her. Why was she alive? Why 
hadn’t she died in the crash? 

Fred must certainly have been 
killed. The asteroid had come 
into view suddenly; there had 
been no chance of avoiding it. It 
had been a miracle that she her- 
self had escaped, if escape it 
could be called — a mere sightless, 
armless and legless torso, with 
no means of communication with 
the outside world, she was more 
dead than alive. And she could 
not believe that the miracle had 
been repeated with Fred. 

It was better that way. Fred 
wouldn’t have to look at her and 



BEDSIDE MANNER 



145 



shudder — and he wouldn’t have 
to worry about himself, either. 
He had always been a handsome 
man, and it would have killed 
him a second time to find himself 
maimed and horrible. 

She must find a way to join 
him, to kill herself. It would be 
difficult, no doubt, without arms 
or legs, without any way of 
knowing her surroundings; but 
sooner or later she would think 
of a way. She had heard some- 
where of people strangling them- 
selves by swallowing their own 
tongues, and the thought cheered 
her. She could at least try that 
right now. She could — 

No, she couldn’t. She hadn’t 
realized it before, but she had no 
tongue. 

She didn’t black out at this 
sudden awareness of a new hor- 
ror, although she desperately 
wanted to. She thought: I can 
make an effort of will, I can force 
myself to die. Die, you fool, you 
helpless lump of flesh. Die and 
end your torture, die, die, die . 

But she didn’t. And after a 
while, a new thought came to her: 
She and Fred had been the only 
ones on their ship; there had been 
no other ship near them. Who 
had kept her from dying? Who 
had taken her crushed body and 
stopped the flow of blood and 
tended her wounds and kept her 
alive? And for what purpose? 

The silence gave no answer. 



Nor did her own mind. 

After an age, she slept again. 

When she awoke, a voice said, 
“Do you feel better?” 

T CAN hear! she shouted to her- 
self. It's a strange voice, a 
most unusual accent. I couldn't 
possibly have imagined it. I'm not 
deaf! Maybe I'm not blind either! 
Maybe I just had a nightmare — 

“I know that you cannot an- 
swer. But do not fear. You will 
soon be able to speak again.” 

Who was it? Not a man’s voice, 
nor a woman’s. It was curiously 
hoarse, and yet clear enough. 
Uninflected, and yet pleasant. A 
doctor? Where could a doctor 
have come from? 

“Your husband is also alive. 
Fortunately, we reached both of 
you at about the time death had 
just begun.” 

Fortunately? She felt a flash of 
rage. You should have let us die. 
It would be bad enough to be 
alive by ' myself, a helpless crip- 
ple dependent upon others. But 
to know that Fred is alive too is 
worse. To know that he has a 
picture of me like this, ugly and 
horrifying, is more than I can 
stand. With any other man it 
would be bad enough, but with 
Fred it's unendurable. Give me 
back the ability to talk, and the 
first thing I'll ask of you is to kill 
me. I don't want to live. 

“It may reassure you to know 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that there will be no difficulty 
about recovering the use of the 
limbs proper to you. and the or- 
gans of sensation. It will take 
time, but there is no doubt about 
the final outcome.” 

What nonsense, she asked her- 
self, was this? Doctors had done 
wonders in the creation and fit- 
ting of artificial arms and legs, 
but he seemed to be promising 
her the use of real limbs. And 
he had said, “organs of sensa- 
tion.” That didn’t sound as if he 
meant that she’d see and hear 
electronically. It meant — 

Nonsense. He was making a 
promise he couldn’t keep. He was 
just saying that to make her feel 
better, the way doctors did. He 
was saying it to give her courage, 
keep her morale up, make her feel 
that it was worth fighting. But it 
wasn't worth fighting. She had no 
courage to keep up. She wanted 
only to die. 

“Perhaps you have already rea- 
lized that I am not what you 
would call human. However, I 
suggest that you do not worry 
too much about that. I shall have 
no difficulty in reconstructing 
you properly according to your 
own standards.” 

T HEN the voice ceased, and she 
was left alone. It was just as 
well, she thought. He had said 
too much. And she couldn’t an- 
swer, nor ask questions of her 



own . and she had so many. 

He wasn’t human? Then what 
was he? And how did he come 
to speak a human language? And 
what did he mean to do with her 
after he had reconstructed her? 
And what would she look like 
after she was reconstructed? 

There were races, she knew, 
that had no sense of beauty. Or if 
they had one, it wasn’t like a 
human sense of beauty. Would 
he consider her properly recon- 
structed if he gave her the right 
number of arms and legs, and 
artificial organs of sight that act- 
ed like eyes — and made her look 
like some creature out of Hell? 
Would he be proud of his handi- 
work, as human doctors had been 
known to be, when their patients 
ended up alive and helpless, their 
bodies scarred, their organs func- 
tioning feebly and imperfectly? 
Would he turn her into some- 
thing that Fred would look at 
with abhorrence and disgust? 

Fred had always been a little 
too sensitive to beauty in women. 
He had been able to pick and 
choose at his will, and until he 
had met her he had always 
chosen on the basis of looks alone. 
She had never understood why 
he had married her. Perhaps the 
fact that she was the one woman 
he knew who wasn't beautiful had 
made her stand out. Perhaps, too, 
she told herself, there was a touch 
of cruelty in his choice. He might

147 



have wanted someone who wasn’t 
too sure of herself, someone he 
could count on under all circum- 
stances. She remembered how 
people had used to stare at them 
— the handsome man and the 
plain woman — and then whisper 
among themselves, wondering 
openly how he had ever come 
to marry her. Fred had liked 
that; she was sure he had liked 
that. 

He had obviously wanted a 
plain wife. Now he would have 
an ugly one. Would he want that? 

She slept on her questions, and 
waked and slept repeatedly. And 
then, one day, she heard the voice 
again. And to her surprise, she 
found that she could answer back 
— slowly, uncertainly, at times 
painfully. But she could speak 
once more. 

“We have been working on 
you,” said the voice. “You are 
coming along nicely.” 

“Am I — am I — ” she found 
difficulty asking: “How do I 
look?” 

“Incomplete.” 

“I must be horrible.” 

A slight pause. “No. Not hor- 
rible at all. Not to me. Merely 
incomplete.” 

“My husband wouldn’t think 
so.” 

“I do not know what your hus- 
band would think. Perhaps he is 
not used to seeing incomplete 
persons. He might even be horri- 



fied at the sight of himself.” 

“I — I hadn’t thought of that. 
But he — we’ll both be all right?” 

“As a medical problem, you 
offer no insuperable difficulty. 
None at all.” 

“Why — why don’t you give me 
eyes, if you can? Are you afraid 
— afraid that I might see you and 
find you — terrifying?” 

A GAIN a pause. There was 
amusement in the reply. “I 
do not think so. No, that is not 
the reason.” 

“Then it’s because — as you said 
about Fred — I might find myself 
horrifying?” 

“That is part of the reason. Not 
the major part, however. You 
see, I am, in a way, experiment- 
ing. Do not be alarmed, please — 
I shall not turn you into a mon- 
ster. I have too much knowledge 
of biology for that. But I am not 
too familiar with human beings. 
What I know I have learned 
mostly from your books, and I 
have found that in certain re- 
spects there are inaccuracies con- 
tained in them — I must go slowly 
until I can check what they say. 
I might mend certain organs, and 
then discover that they do not 
have the proper size or shape, or 
that they produce slightly altered 
hormones. I do not want to make 
such mistakes, and if I do make 
them, I wish to correct them be- 
fore they can do harm.”

“There’s no danger — ?” 

“None, I assure you. Intern- 
ally and externally, you will be 
as before.” 

“Internally and externally. Will 
I — will I be able to have chil 
dren?” 

“Yes. We ourselves do not have 
your distinctions of sex, but we 
are familiar with them in many 
other races. We know how im- 
portant you consider them. I am 
taking care to see that the proper 
glandular balance is maintained 
in both yourself and your hus- 
band.” 

“Thank you— Doctor. But I 
still don’t understand — why don’t 
you give me eyes right away?” 

“I do not wish to give you eyes 
that see imperfectly, and then be 
forced to take them away. Nor do 
I want you to watch imperfect 
arms and legs developing. It 
would be an unnecessary ordeal. 
When I am sure that everything 
is as it should be, then I shall 
start your eyes.” 

“And my husband — ” 

“He will be reconstructed in 
the same way. He will be brought 
in to talk to you soon.” 

“And you don’t want either of 
us to see the other in — in im- 
perfect condition?” 

“It would be inadvisable. I can 
assure you now that when I have 
completed your treatment you 
will almost exactly be as you were 
in the beginning. When that time 



comes, you will be able to use 
your eyes.” 

She was silent a moment. 

He said, “Your husband had 
other questions. I am waiting to 
hear you ask them too.” 

“I’m sorry, Doctor ... I wasn’t 
listening. What did you say?” 

TTE repeated his remarks, and 
she said, “I do have other 
questions. But — no, I won’t ask 
them yet. What did my husband 
want to know?” 

“About me and my race. How 
we happened to find you in time 
to save you. Why we saved you. 
What we intend to do with you 
after you are reconstructed.” 
“Yes, I’ve wondered about 
those things too.” 

“I can give you only a partial 
answer. I hope you do not find it 
too unsatisfactory. My race, as 
you may have gathered, is some- 
what more advanced than yours. 
We have had a head start,” he 
added politely. 

“If you can grow new arms 
and legs and eyes,” she said, “you 
must be thousands of years ahead 
of us.” 

“We can do many other things, 
of which there is no need to talk. 
All I need say now is that I am a 
physician attached to a scouting 
expedition. We have had previous 
contact with human beings, and 
have taken pains to avoid coming 
to their attention. We do not want

149 



to alarm or confuse them.” 

"But all the same, you rescued 
us.” 

“It was an emergency. We are 
not human, but we have, you 
might say, humanitarian feelings. 
We do not like to see creatures 
die, even inferior creatures — not 
that you are, of course,” he added 
delicately. “Our ship happened to 
be only a few thousand miles 
away when it happened. We saw, 
and acted with great speed. Once 
you are whole again, we shall 
place you where you will be 
found by your own kind, and pro- 
ceed on our way. By that time, 
our expedition will have been 
completed.” 

“When we are whole again — 
Doctor, will I be exactly the 
same as before?” 

“In some ways, perhaps even 
better. I can assure you that all 
your organs will function per- 
fectly.” 

“I don’t mean that. I mean — 
will I look the same?” 

She felt that there was astonish- 
ment in the pause. “Look the 
same? Does that matter?” 

“Yes ... oh, yes, it matters! 
It matters more than anything 
else.” 

He must have been regarding 
her as if she were crazy. Suddenly 
she was glad that she had no 
eyes to see his bewilderment. And 
his contempt, which, she was sure, 
must be there too. 



He said slowly, “I didn’t rea- 
lize. But, of course, we don’t 
know how you did look. How can 
we make you look the same?” 

“I don’t know. But you must! 
You must!” Her voice rose, and 
she felt the pain in her throat 
as the new muscles constricted. 

“You are getting hysterical,” 
he said. “Stop thinking about 
this.” 

“But I can’t stop thinking 
about it. It’s the only thing I can 
think of! I don’t want to look 
any different from the way I did 
before!” 

He said nothing, and suddenly 
she felt tired. A moment before 
she had been so excited, so up- 
set; and now — merely tired and 
sleepy. She wanted to go to sleep 
and forget it all. He must have 
given me a sedative, she thought. 
An injection? I didn't feel the 
prick of the needle, but maybe 
they don't use needles. Anyway, 
I’m glad he did. Because now I 
won't have to think, I won't be 
able to think — 

S HE slept. When she awoke 
again, she heard a new voice. 
A voice she couldn’t place. It said, 
“Hello, Margaret. Where are 
you?” 

“Who . Fred!” 

“Margaret?” 

“Y-yes.” 

“Your voice is different.” 

“So is yours. At first I couldn’t

think who was speaking to me!” 
“It’s strange it took us so long 
to realize that our voices would 
be different.” 

She said shakily, “We’re more 
accustomed to thinking of how 
we look.” 

He was silent. His mind had 
been on the same thing. 

“Your new voice isn’t bad, 
Fred,” she said after a moment. 
“I like it. It’s a little deeper, a 
little more resonant. It will go 
well with your personality. The 
Doctor has done a good job.” 
“I’m trying to think whether I 
like yours. I don’t know. I sup- 
pose I’m the kind of guy who 
likes best what he’s used to.” 

“I know. That’s why I didn’t 
want him to change my looks.” 
Again silence. 

She said, “Fred?” 

“I’m still here.” 

“Have you talked to him about 
it?” 

“He’s talked to me. He’s told 
me about your being worried.” 
“Don’t you think it matters?” 
“Yes, I suppose it does. He told 
me he could do a good technical 
job — leave us with regular fea- 
tures and unblemished skins.” 
“That isn’t what I want,” she 
said fiercely. “I don’t want the 
kind of regular features that come 
out of physiology books. I want 
my own features. I don’t care so 
much about the voice, but I want 
my own face back!”

“That’s a lot to ask for. Hasn’t 
he done enough for us?” 

“No. Nothing counts unless I 
have that. Do— do you think that 
I’m being silly?” 

“Well—” 

“I don’t want to be beautiful, 
because I know you don’t want 
me to be.” 

He sounded amazed. “Whoever 
told you that?” 

“Do you think that after living 
with you for two years, I don’t 
know? If you had wanted a beau- 
tiful wife, you’d have married 
one. Instead, you chose me. You 
wanted to be the good-looking 
one of the family. You’re vain, 
Fred. Don’t try to deny it, be- 
cause it would be no use. You’re 
vain. Not that I mind it, but you 
are.” 

“Are you feeling all right, Mar- 
garet? You sound — overwrought.” 
“I’m not. I’m being very log- 
ical. If I were either ugly or 
beautiful, you’d hate me. If I 
were ugly, people would pity you, 
and you wouldn’t be able to stand 
that. And if I were beautiful, 
they might forget about you. I’m 
just plain enough for them to 
wonder why you ever married 
anyone so ordinary. I'm just the 
kind of person to supply back- 
ground for you.” 

A FTER a moment he said 
slowly, “I never knew you 
had ideas like that about me. 

151 



They’re silly ideas. I married you 
because I loved you.” 

“Maybe you did. But why did 
you love me?” 

He said patiently, “Let’s not 
go into that. The fact is, Mar- 
garet, that you’re talking non- 
sense. I don’t give a damn wheth- 
er you’re ugly or beautiful — well, 
no, that isn’t strictly true. I do 
care — but looks aren’t the most 
important thing. They have very 
little to do with the way I feel 
about you. I love you for the 
kind of person you are. Every- 
thing else is secondary.” 

“Please, Fred, don’t lie to me. 
I want to be the same as before, 
because I know that’s the way 
you want me. Isn’t there some 
way to let the Doctor know what 
sort of appearance we made? You 
have — had — a good eye. Maybe 
you could describe us — ” 

“Be reasonable, Margaret. You 
ought to know that you can’t tell 
anything from a description.” His 
voice was almost pleading. “Let’s 
leave well enough alone. I don’t 
care if your features do come out 
of the pictures in a physiology 
textbook — ” 

“Fred!” she said excitedly. 
“That’s it! Pictures! Remember 
that stereo shot we had taken 
just before we left Mars? It must 
be somewhere on the ship — ” 
“But the ship was crushed, 
darling. It’s a total wreck.” 

“Not completely. If they could 



take us out alive, there must 
have been some unhurt portions 
left. Maybe the stereo is still 
there !” 

“Margaret, you’re asking the 
impossible. We don’t know where 
the ship is. This group the Doc- 
tor is with is on a scouting ex- 
pedition. The wreck of our ship 
may have been left far behind. 
They’re not going to retrace their 
tracks just to find it.” 

“But it’s the only way . the 
only way! There’s nothing else — ” 
She broke down. If she had 
possessed eyes, she would have 
wept — but as it was, she could 
weep only internally. 

They must have taken him 
away, for there was no answer 
to her tearless sobbing. And after 
a time, she felt suddenly that 
there was nothing to cry about. 
She felt, in fact, gay and cheerful 
— and the thought struck her: 
The Doctor’s given me another 
drug. He doesn't want me to cry. 
Very well, I won’t. I’ll think of 
things to make me happy, I’ll 
bubble over with good spirits — 
Instead, she fell into a dream- 
less sleep. 

W HEN she awoke again, she 
thought of the conversation 
with Fred, and the feeling of des- 
peration returned. I’ll have to tell 
the Doctor all about it, she 
thought. I’ll have to see what he 
can do. I know it’s asking an 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



awful lot, but without it, all the 
rest he has done for me won't 
count. Better to be dead than be ’ 
different from what I was. 

But it wasn’t necessary to tell 
the Doctor. Fred had spoken to 
him first. 

So Fred admits ifs important 
too. He won't be able to deny 
any longer that I judged him cor- 
rectly. 

The Doctor said, “What you 
are asking is impossible.” 

“Impossible? You won’t even 
try?” 

“My dear patient, the wrecked 
ship is hundreds of millions of 
miles behind us. The expedition 
has its appointed task. It cannot 
retrace its steps. It cannot waste 
time searching the emptiness of 
space for a stereo which may not 
even exist any longer.” 

“Yes, you’re right . I’m sorry 
I asked, Doctor.” 

He read either her mind or the 
hopelessness in her voice. He said, 
“Do not make any rash plans. 
You cannot carry them out, you 
know.” 

“I’ll find a way. Sooner or later 
I’ll find a way to do something 
to myself.” 

“You are being very foolish. I 
cannot cease to marvel at how 
foolish you are. Are many human 
beings like you, psychologically?” 

“I don’t know, Doctor. I don’t 
care. I know only what’s im- 
portant to me!” 



“But to make such a fuss about 
the merest trifle! The difference 
in appearance between one hu- 
man being and another of the 
same sex, so far as we can see, is 
insignificant. You must learn to 
regard it in its true light.” 

“You think it’s insignificant 
because you don’t know anything 
about men and women. To Fred 
and me, it’s the difference be- 
tween life and death.” 

He said in exasperation, “You 
are a race of children. But some- 
times even a child must be hu- 
mored. I shall see what I can do.” 
But what could he do? she 
asked herself. The ship was a 
derelict in space, and in it, float- 
ing between the stars, was the 
stereo he wouldn’t make an at- 
tempt to find. Would he try to 
get a description from Fred? 
Even the best human artist 
couldn’t produce much of a like- 
ness from a mere verbal descrip- 
tion. What could someone like 
the Doctor do — someone to whom 
all men looked alike, and all 
women? 

A S she lay there, thinking and 
wondering, she had only the 
vaguest idea of the passage of 
time. But slowly, as what must 
have been day followed day, she 
became aware of strange tingling 
sensations all over her body. The 
pains she had felt at first had 
slowly diminished and then van- 



BEDSIDE MANNER 



153 



ished altogether. What she felt 
now was not pain at all. It was 
even mildly pleasant, as if some 
one were gently massaging her 
body, stretching her muscles, tug- 
ging at her — 

Suddenly she realized what it 
was: New limbs were growing. 
Her internal organs must have 
developed properly, and now the 
Doctor had gone ahead with 
the rest of his treatment. 

With the realization, tears be- 
gan to roll down her cheeks. 
Tears, she thought, real tears — I 
can feel them. I'm getting arms 
and legs, and I can shed tears. 
But I still have no eyes. 

But maybe they’re growing in 
. From time to time I seem 
to see flashes of light. Maybe he’s 
making them develop slowly, and 
he put the tear ducts in order 
first. I’ll have to tell him that 
my eyes must be blue. Maybe I 
never was beautiful, but I always 
had pretty eyes. I don’t want any 
different color. They wouldn’t 
go with my face. 

The next time the Doctor spoke 
to her, she told him. 

“You may have your way,” he 
said good-naturedly, as if humor- 
ing a child. 

“And, Doctor, about finding the 
ship again — ” 

“Out of the question, as I told 
you. However, it will not be nec- 
essary.” He paused, as if savor- 
ing what he had to tell her. “I 



checked with our records depart- 
ment. As might have been ex- 
pected, they searched your shat- 
tered ship thoroughly, in the hope 
of finding information that might 
contribute to our understanding 
of your race. They have the 
stereos, about a dozen of them.” 

“A dozen stereos? But I 
thought — ” 

“In your excitement, you may 
have forgotten that there were 
more than one. All of them seem 
to be of yourself and your hus- 
band. However, they were ob- 
viously taken under a wide vari- 
ety of conditions, and with a wide 
variety of equipment, for there 
are certain minor differences be- 
tween them which even I, with 
my non-human vision, can de- 
tect. Perhaps you can tell us 
which one you prefer us to use 
as a model.” 

She said slowly, “I had better 
talk about that with my husband. 
Can' you have him brought in 
here, Doctor?” 

“Of course.” 

CHE lay there, thinking. A 
^ dozen stereos. And there was 
still only one that she remem- 
bered. Only a single one. They 
had posed for others, during the 
honeymoon and shortly after, but 
those had been left at home on 
Mars before they started on their 
trip. 

Fred’s new voice said, “How are 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you feeling, dear?” 

“Strange. I seem to have new 
limbs growing in.” 

“So do I. Guess we’ll be our 
old selves pretty soon.” 

“Will we?” 

She could imagine his forehead 
wrinkling at the intonation of her 
voice. “What do you mean, Mar- 
garet?” 

“Hasn’t the Doctor told you? 
They have the stereos they found 
on our ship. Now they can model 
our new faces after our old.” 

“That’s what you wanted, isn’t 
it?” 

“But what do you want, Fred? 
I remember only a single one, 
and the Doctor says they found 
a dozen. And he says that my 
face differs from shot to shot.” 

Fred was silent. 

“Are they as beautiful as all 
that, Fred?” 

“You don’t understand, Mar- 
garet.” 

“I understand only too well. I 
just want to know— were they 
taken before we were married or 
after?” 

“Before, of course. I haven’t 
gone out with another girl since 
our wedding.” 

“Thank you, dear.” Her own 
new voice had venom in it, and 
she caught herself. I musn't talk 
like that, she thought. I know 
Fred, I know his weakness. I 
knew them before I married him. 
I have to accept them and help 



him, not rant at him for them. 

He said, “They were just girls 
I knew casually. Good-looking, 
but nothing much otherwise. Not 
in a class with you.” 

“Don’t apologize.” This time 
her voice was calm, even amused. 
“You couldn’t help attracting 
them. Why didn’t you tell me 
that you kept their pictures?” 

“I thought you’d be jealous.” 
“Perhaps I would have been, 
but I’d have got over it. Anyway, 
Fred, is there any one of them 
you liked particularly?” 

TTE became wary, she thought. 

His voice was expressionless 
as he said, “No.' Why?” 

“Oh, I thought that perhaps 
you’d want the Doctor to make 
me look like her.” 

“Don’t be silly, Margaret! I 
don’t want you to look like any- 
body but yourself. I don’t want 
to see their empty faces ever 
again!” 

“But I thought — ” 

“Tell the Doctor to keep the 
other stereos. Let him put them 
in one of his museums, with other 
dead things. They don’t mean 
anything to me any more. They 
haven’t meant anything for a long 
time. The only reason I didn’t 
throw them away is because I 
forgot they were there and didn’t 
think of it.” 

“All right, Fred. I’ll tell him to 
use our picture as a model.” 



BEDSIDE MANNER

“The AC studio shot. The 
close-up. Make sure he uses the 
right one.” 

“I’ll see that there’s no mis- 
take.” 

“When I think I might have to 
look at one of their mugs for the 
rest of my life, I get a cold sweat. 
Don’t take any chances, Mar- 
garet. It’s your face I want to 
see, and no one else’s.” 

“Yes, dear.” 

I'll be plain, she thought, but 
I'll wear well. A background al- 
ways wears well. Time can't hurt 
it much, because there's nothing 
there to hurt. 

There's one thing 1 overlooked, 
though. How old will we look? 
The Doctor is rather insensitive 
about human faces, and he might 
age us a bit. He mustn't do that. 
It'll be all right if he wants to 
make us a little younger, but not 
older. I'll have to warn him. 

She warned him, and again he 
seemed rather amused at her. 

“All right,” he said, “you will 
appear slightly younger. Not too 
much so, however, for from my 
reading I judge it best for a hu- 
man face to show not too great a 
discrepancy from the physiolog- 
ical age.” 

She breathed a sigh of relief. 
It was settled now, all settled. 
Everything would be as before — 
perhaps just a little better. She 
and Fred could go back to their 
married life with the knowledge 



that they would be as happy as 
ever. Nothing exuberant, of 
course, but as happy as their own 
peculiar natures permitted. As 
happy as a plain and worried wife 
and a handsome husband could 
ever be. 

N OW that this had been de- 
cided, the days passed slow- 
ly. Her arms and legs grew, and 
her eyes too. She could feel the 
beginnings of fingers and toes, 
and on the sensitive optic nerve 
the flashes of light came with 
greater and greater frequency. 
There were slight pains from time 
to time, but they were pains 
she welcomed. They were the 
pains of growth, of return to 
normalcy. 

And then came the day when 
the Doctor said, “You have re- 
covered. In another day, as you 
measure time, I shall remove your 
bandages.” 

Tears welled up in her new 
eyes. “Doctor, I don’t know how 
to thank you.” 

“No thanks are needed. I have 
only done my work.” 

"What will you do with us 
now?” 

“There is an old freighter of 
your people which we have found 
abandoned and adrift. We have 
repaired it and stocked it with 
food taken from your own ship. 
You will awaken inside the 
freighter and be able to reach 



156 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



your own people.” 

“But won’t I — can’t I even get 
the chance to see you?” 

“That would be inadvisable. 
We have some perhaps peculiar 
ideas about keeping our nature 
secret. That is why we shall take 
care that you carry away nothing 
that we ourselves have made.” 

“If I could only — well, even 
shake hands — do something — ” 

“I have no hands.” 

“No hands? But how could you 
— how can you — do such com- 
plicated things?” 

“I may not answer. I am sorry 
to leave you in a state of be- 
wilderment, but I have no choice. 
Now, please, no more questions 
about me. Do you wish to talk 
to your husband for a time be- 
fore you sleep again?” 

“Must I sleep? I feel so excited 
... I want to get out of bed, 
tear off my bandages, and see 
what I look like!” 

“I take it that you are not 
anxious to speak to your husband 
yet.” 

“I want to see myself first!” 
“You will have to wait. Dur- 
ing your last sleep, your new 
muscles will be exercised, their 
tones and strength built up. You 
will receive a final medical ex- 
amination. It is most important.” 
She started to protest once 
more, but he stopped her. “Try 
to be calm. I can control your 
feelings with drugs, but it is bet- 



ter that you control yourself. You 
will be able to give vent to your 
excitement later. And now I must 
leave you. You will not hear from 
me after this.” 

“Never again?” 

“Never again. Goodbye.” 

For a moment she felt some- 
thing cool and dry and rough 
laid very lightly against her fore- 
head. She tried to reach for him, 
but could only twitch her new 
hands on her new wrists. She said, 
with a sob, “Goodbye, Doctor.” 
When she spoke again, there 
was no answer. 

She slept. 

f'T'HIS time, the awakening was 
different. Before she opened 
her eyes, she heard the creaking 
of the freighter, and a slight hum 
that might have come from the 
firing of the jets. 

As she tried to sit up, her eyes 
flashed open, and she saw that 
she was lying in a bunk, strapped 
down to keep from being thrown 
out. Unsteadily, she began to 
loosen the straps. When they were 
half off, she stopped to stare at 
her hands. They were strong 
hands, well-shaped and supple, 
with a healthily tanned skin. She 
flexed them and unflexed them 
several times. Beautiful hands. 
The Doctor had done well by her. 

She finished undoing the straps, 
and got to her feet. There was 
none of the dizziness she had ex- 



BEDSIDE MANNER 



157 




158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pected, none of the weakness that 
would have been normal after so 
long a stay in bed. She felt fine. 

She examined herself, staring 
at her legs, body — staring as she 
might have done at a stranger’s 
legs and body. She took a few 
steps forward and then back. 
Yes, he had done well by her. 
It was a graceful body, and it 
felt fine. Better than new. 

But her face! 

She whirled around to locate a 
mirror, and heard a voice: “Mar- 
garet!” 

Fred was getting out of an- 
other bunk. Their eyes sought 
each other’s faces, and for a long 
moment they stared in silence. 

Fred said in a choked voice, 
“There must be a mirror in the 
captain’s cabin. I’ve got to see 
myself.” 

At the mirror, their eyes shifted 
from one face to the other and 
back again. And the silence this 
time was longer, more painful. 

A wonderful artist, the Doctor. 
For a creature — a person — who 
was insensitive to the differences 
in human faces, he could follow 
a pattern perfectly. Feature by 
feature, they were as before. Size 
and shape of forehead, dip of 
hairline, width of cheeks and 
height of cheekbones, shape and 
color of eyes, contour of nose 
and lips and chin — nothing in the 
two faces had been changed. 
Nothing at all. 



Nothing, that is, but the over- 
all effect. Nothing but the fact 
that where before she had been 
plain, now she was beautiful. 

I should have realized the pos- 
sibility, she thought. Sometimes 
you see two sisters, or mother and 
daughter, with the same features, 
the faces as alike as if they had 
been cast from the same mold — 
and yet one is ugly and the other 
beautiful. Many artists can copy 
features, but few can copy with 
perfect exactness either beauty or 
ugliness. The Doctor slipped up 
a little. Despite my warning, he's 
done too well by me. 

And not well enough by Fred. 
Fred isn't handsome any more. 
Not ugly really — his face is 
stronger and more interesting 
than it was. But now I'm the 
good-looking one of the family. 
And he won't be able to take it. 
This is the end for us. 

TT'RED was grinning at her. He 
said, “Wow, what a wife I’ve 
got! Just look at you! Do you 
mind if I drool a bit?” 

She said uncertainly, “Fred, 
dear. I’m sorry.” 

“For what? For his giving you 
more than you bargained for — 
and me less? It’s all in the fami- 
ly!” 

“You don’t have to pretend, 
Fred. I know how you feel.” 
“You don’t know a thing. I 
asked him to make you beauti- 



BEDSIDE MANNER 



159 



ful. I wasn’t sure he could, but I 
asked him anyway. And he said 
he’d try.” 

“You asked him— -oh, no!” 

“Oh, yes,” he said. “Are you 
sorry? I hoped he’d do better 
for me, but — well, did you marry 
me for my looks?” 

“You know better, Fred!” 

“I didn’t marry you for yours 
either. I told you that before, but 
you wouldn’t believe me. Maybe 
now you will.” 

Her voice choked. “Perhaps — 
perhaps looks aren’t so impor- 
tant after all. Perhaps I’ve been 
all wrong about everything. I 
used to think was essential.” 
“You have,” agreed Fred. “But 
you’ve always had a sense of 
inferiority about your appear- 
ance. From now on, you’ll have 
no reason for that. And maybe 
now we’ll both be able to grow up 
a little.” 

She nodded. It gave her a 
strange feeling to have him put 



around her a pair of arms she 
had never before known, to have 
him kiss her with lips she had 
never before touched. But that 
doesn't matter, she thought. The 
important thing is that whatever 
shape we take, we're us. The im- 
portant thing is that now we don’t 
have to worry about ourselves — 
and for that we have to thank 
him. 

“Fred,” she said suddenly, her 
face against his chest. “Do you 
think a girl can be in love with 
two — two people — at the same 
time? And one of them— one of 
them not a man? Not even hu- 
man?” 

He nodded, but didn’t say any- 
thing. And after a moment, she 
thought she knew why. A man 
can love that way too, she 
thought — and one of them not a 
woman, either. 

I wonder if he . she ... it 
knew. I wonder if it knew.
