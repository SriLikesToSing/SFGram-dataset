FOR REAL JOB SECURITY 
-GET AK I.C.S. DIPLOMA 




“You can stop worrying, Jane. 
My job’s secure now! And here’s 
the insurance policy to prove it— 
my I.C.S. diploma!” 

This feeling of security is 
probably typical of every I.C.S. 
graduate. Because— as the job 
silualion gets tighter, the man 
with I.C.S. training has the 
advantage. 

Why? Your I.C.S. diploma tells 
your present employer three im- 
portant things: (1) You want to 
make the most of your present job. 



(2) You have the training you 
need for advancement. (3) You 
look for better ways of doing things 
on your own. 

What you do about your fu- 
ture is up to you* Do nothing 
and stay at your present job at 
the same old pay. Or earn an 
I.C.S. diploma in your spare 
time for security, promotions, 
more pay! Your first step is to 
mark the course that interests 
you in the coupon below, and 
mail it to ns. 

Free books 

We’ll send you two interesting 
books. The first, “How to Suc- 
ceed,” is a gold mine of helpful 
tips. Points out many small things 
in your personality and behavior 
that can make the difference be- 
tween success and failure. The 
second book tells you about the 
opportunities in the field of your 
choice. Free sample lesson. 



Costs pennlos a day 

Many an I.CJ5. student has made 
up the cost of his course in one 
month with the salary increase bis 
I.C.S. training earned for him. By 
studying at home in your spare 
time, you pay yourself many times 
an hour more than you’re now 
making. (One student reports — 
“My l.C.$. coarse was worth $95 
an hour to me.”) 

The security of your pres* 
ent job— or the success in find* 
ing the new job you’ve always 
wanted— is in your hands. Sfove 
ahead with 1. C. S. training 
while others stay behind on the 
routine, small-pay jobs. Re- 
member, your first step to se- 
curity and success is to mail 
this coupon. Take a few min- 
utes and do it now. If yotf put 
it off, it can cost you your 
future.

LIFE has a place for 



EVERY HUMAN being has a mission to 
fulfill in the universal scheme. For each 
person there is a place in life which will 
fit him like a glove — make him happy 
and at peace with the world. You as a 
part in the giant jigsaw puzzle of the 
Infinite, have a perfect fit, somewhere. 

It is inconceivable that the vast, or- 
derly universal Intelligence we observe 



about us could exist without purpose 
or direction in every detail. The key to 
finding your place in this order lies 
within man’s own subconscious mind. 
Many men, in an entire lifetime, expe- 
rience only a small portion of what 
they could really have achieved had 
they known the secret of tapping their 
own mental reserve. 



TOMORROW IS YOURS 

Find your place in life! Let the Rosicrucians, an age-old, world-wide fraternity of pro- 
gressive men and women, show you how. Their knowledge is the ageless science of life — 
it has been used for centuries to direct the world’s thinkers and doers to their proper 
niche in the universal plan. Write today for your free copy of The Mastery of Life. It will 
explain who and what the Rosicrucians are and, moreover, how they can help you make 
tomorrow as you want it. Address: Scribe M.G.J.

SPEAKING 

OF TRENDS 



year I wrote over a mil- 
-*■ lion words of fact detective 
cases, several pronounced reac- 
tions set in: I got dizzy trying 
to keep track of my pen names 
because I was filling whole is- 
sues, exhausted myself until I 
couldn’t look another rape in the 
face . and developed immense 
respect for criminology. 

All sorts of forensic experts run 
the crime lab, dedicated to the 
gathering and dovetailing of evi- 
dence that will win convictions. 

Much of the work is downright 
beautiful in its resourcefulness 
and ingenuity. Seeing how cases 
are built up point by point is a 
great comfort for anyone who 
worries about the constant in- 
crease in crime. 

But there’s a side I hadn’t been 
aware of until reading an article 
in This Week Magazine, quoting 
a trial lawyer named Allen Mur- 
ray Myers: “If you are accused 
of a crime in the U. S. today, you 
probably could not afford ade- 
quately to defend yourself . we 
have set up vast, expensive ma- 
chinery for getting convictions 
. but while we have been stead- 
ily strengthening the prosecutor’s 



office, most places do not provide 
one cent to help the poor accused 
persons.” 

“Poor” is used financially here, 
though it seems to be an adjec- 
tive that can describe anyone 
who’s been through a major trial. 

As an example, Myers cites 
the case of a man indicted for the 
murder of his wife: “His trial 
cost him $10,000; he was found 
guilty. It cost him $5,000 to ap- 
peal . The new trial cost an- 
other $10,000; again he was found 
guilty and again he appealed 
for another $5,000. This time he 
was set free. Total cost of prov- 
ing himself innocent — $30,000.” 

Why so much? Well, Myers 
gives the case of a woman, ac- 
cused of murdering her husband, 
whose alibi was that she was on 
a bus to her home town at the 
time. Naturally, she had to 
prove it. 

But her ticket had been col- 
lected, so detectives would have 
to be hired to locate the driver, 
other passengers, redcaps, cab- 
bies — anyone who might support 
her alibi. 

Then it would be necessary to 
bring the witnesses to town, pay 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



their expenses during the trial — 
plus all income lost while testi- 
fying. 

The woman, of course, could 
not afford it. But the prosecutor, 
if he had to, could have done all 
that and a lot more. 

Here is Myers’ dismaying 
breakdown of expenses: 

1. A detective to get needed 
facts. 

2. Bringing witnesses from out 
of town. 

3. From $750 to $1,000 for a 
trial transcript. 

4. Fees for scientific experts. 

A trial transcript is required 

for appeal. Scientific experts 
must be hired to contest the find- 
ings of the prosecutor’s experts. 
It all adds up to ruin for the 
average citizen. His resources just 
can’t match those pitted against 
him. 

To put it starkly, crime detec- 
tion has become so complex and 
expensive that most of us, if ac- 
cused, literally could not afford 
to defend ourselves. The lawyers 
appointed to defend the penni- 
less were once a more or less ade- 
quate gesture: they’re not any 
longer. 

Every scientific aid in the fight 
against crime is to be welcomed 
. but how goes the fight? 

Damned badly, if you want the. 
truth. Bergen Evans’ The Spoor 
of Spooks (Knopf) quotes the 
Chicago Crime Commission’s re- 



port that “approximately 97% 
of the burglaries and 91% of the 
robberies committed in Chicago 
in 1951 did not even result in an 
indictment.” As Evans points 
out, “an indictment is a long way 
from a conviction.” 

The Wickersham and Seabury 
investigations of 20 years ago, he 
adds, “agreed that a criminal had 
about a 99% chance of escaping 
punishment . our whole prison 
system is geared to the expecta- 
tion that there will not be more 
than one conviction for every 20 
felonies.” 

The record is even worse for 
murder. Out of 700 professional 
slayings in Chicago in the last 
25 years, there were less than 10 
convictions! And, Evans de- 
clares, “Chicago’s record is better 
in this respect than that of twenty 
other American cities.” 

All civilized countries share 
these problems with us. 

Are there solutions? Every- 
body has at least one. But the 
tragic fact is that none has yet 
worked . and even more tragic 
is the realization that there are 
innocent persons in prison while 
well-heeled criminals, who can 
afford adequate defense, are not. 

Here, then, are two exponential 
curves rising sharply in two op- 
posite directions. What’s the pay- 
off? I wish I knew of one. Maybe 
you do.

The Servant Problem 

By WIlUAM TENN 

When polities is a game, there is only one 
rule: Follow the leader. But the question 
is: Who's the leader and where's he going? 



Illustrated by EMSH 



T his was the day of com- 
plete control . 

Garomma, the Servant 
of All, the World's Drudge, the 
Slavey of Civilization, placed del- 
icately scented fingertips to his 
face, closed his eyes and allowed 
himself to luxuriate in the sensa- 
tion of ultimate power, absolute 
power, power such as no human 
being had even dared to dream 
of before this day; 

Complete control. Complete . 
Except for one man. One single 
ambitious maverick of a man. 
One very useful man. Should he 
be strangled at his desk this 
afternoon, that was the question, 
or should he be allowed a few 
more days, a few more weeks, of 



7 



heavily supervised usefulness? 
His treason, his plots, were un- 
questionably coming to a head. 
Well, Garomma would decide 
that later. At leisure. 

Meanwhile, in all other re- 
spects, with everyone else, there 
was control. Control not only of 
men’s minds but of their glands 
as well. And those of their chil- 
dren. 

And, if Moddo’s estimates 
were correct, of their children’s 
children. 

“Yea,” Garomma muttered to 
himself, suddenly remembering a 
fragment of the oral text his peas- 
ant father had taught him years 
ago, “yea, unto the seventh gen- 
eration.” 

What ancient book, burned in 
some long-ago educational fire, 
had that text come from, he won- 
dered? His father would not be 
able to tell him, nor would any 
of his father’s friends and neigh- 
bors; they had all been wiped 
out after the Sixth District Peas- 
ant Uprising thirty years ago. 

An uprising of a type that could 
never possibly occur again. Not 
with complete control. 

SOMEONE touched his knee 
^ gently, and his mind ceased its 
aimless foraging. Moddo. The 
Servant of Education, seated be- 
low him in the depths of the 
vehicle, gestured obsequiously at 
the transparent, missile-proof 



cupola that surrounded his leader 
down to the waist. 

“The people,” he stated in his 
peculiar half-stammer. “There. 
Outside.” 

Yes. They were rolling through-, 
the gates of the Hovel of Service 
and into the city proper. On both 
sides of the street and far into 
the furthest distance were shriek- 
ing crowds as black and dense 
and exuberant as ants on a piece 
of gray earthworm. Garomma, 
the Servant of All, could not be 
too obviously busy with his own 
thoughts; he was about to be 
viewed by those he served so 
mightily. 

He crossed his arms upon his 
chest and bowed to right and left 
in the little dome that rose like 
a tower from the squat black con- 
veyance. Bow right, bow left, and 
do it humbly. Right, left — and 
humbly, humbly. Remember, you 
are the Servant of All. 

As the shrieks rose in volume, 
he caught a glimpse of Moddo 
nodding approval from beneath. 
Good old Moddo. This was his 
day of triumph as well. The 
achievement of complete control 
was most thoroughly and pecu- 
liarly the achievement of the 
Servant of Education. Yet Moddo 
sat in heavy-shadowed anonym- 
ity behind the driver with Ga- 
romma’s personal bodyguards; 
sat and tasted his triumph only 
with his leader’s tongue — as he 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



had for more than twenty-five 
years now. 

Fortunately for Moddo, such a 
taste was rich enough for his sys- 
tem. Unfortunately, there were 
others — one other at least — ^who 
required more . 

Garomma bowed to right and 
left and, as he bowed, looked 
curiously through the streaming 
webs of black-uniformed motor- 
cycled police that surrounded his 
car. He looked at the people of 
Capital City, his people, his as 
everything and everyone on Earth 
was his. Jamming madly together 
on the sidewalks, they threw their 
arms wide as his car came abreast 
of them. 

“Serve us, Garomma,” they 
chanted. “Serve us! Serve us!” 

He observed their contorted 
faces, the foam that appeared at 
the mouth-corners of many, the 
half-shut eyes and ecstatic ex- 
pressions, the swaying men, the 
writhing women, the occasional 
individual who collapsed in an 
unnoticed climax of happiness. 
And he bowed. With his arms 
crossed upon his chest, he bowed. 
Right and left. Humbly. 

L ast week, when Moddo had 
requested his views on prob- 
lems of ceremony and protocol 
relative to today’s parade, the 
Servant of Education had com- 
mented smugly on the unusually 
high incidence of mob hysteria ex- 



pected when his chiefs face was 
seen. And Garomma had voiced 
a curiosity he’d been feeling for 
a long time. 

“What goes on in their minds 
when they see me, Moddo? I know 
they worship and get exhilarated 
and all that. But what precisely 
do you fellows call the emotion 
when you talk about it in the 
labs and places such as the Edu- 
cation Center?” 

The tall man slid his hand 
across his forehead in the gesture 
that long years had made thor- 
oughly familiar to Garomma. 

“They are experiencing a trig- 
ger release,” he said slowly, star- 
ing over Garomma’s shoulder as 
if he were working out the an- 
swer from the electronically pin- 
pointed world map on the back 
wall. “All the tensions these peo- 
ple accumulate in their daily 
round of niggling little prohibi- 
tions and steady coercions, all 
the frustrations of ‘don’t do this 
and don’t do this, do that’ have 
been organized by the Service 
of Education to be released ex- 
plosively the moment they see 
your picture or hear your voice.” 

“Trigger release. Hm! I’ve 
never thought of it quite that 
way.” 

Moddo held up a hand in rigid 
earnestness. “After all, you’re the 
one man whose life is supposedly 
spent in an abject obedience be- 
yond anything they’ve ever 



THE SERVANT PROBLEM 



9 



known. The man who holds the — 
the intricate strands of the world’s 
coordination in his patient, un- 
wearying fingers; the ultimate 
and hardest -worked employee; 
the — ^the scapegoat of the multi- 
tudes!” 

Garomma had grinned at Mod- 
do’s scholarly eloquence. Now, 
however, as he observed his 
screaming folk from under sub- 
missive eyelids, he decided that 
the Servant of Education had 
been completely right. 

On the Great Seal of the World 
State was it not written: “All 
Men Must Serve Somebody, But 
Only Garomma Is the Servant of 
Air? 

Without him, they knew, and 
knew irrevocably, oceans would 
break through dikes and flood 
the land, infections would appear 
in men’s bodies and grow rapidly 
into pestilences that could deci- 
mate whole districts, essential 
services would break down so that 
an entire city could die of thirst 
in a week, and local officials 
would oppress the people and en- 
gage in lunatic wars of massacre 
with each other. Without him, 
without Garomma working day 
and night to keep everything run- 
ning smoothly, to keep the ti- 
tanic forces of nature and civili- 
zation under control. They knew, 
because these things happened 
whenever “Garomma was tired of 
serving.” 



What were the unpleasant in- 
terludes of their lives to the im- 
placable dreary — but, oh, so es- 
sential! — ^toil of his? Here, in this 
slight, serious-looking man bow- 
ing humbly right and left, right 
and left, was not only the divin- 
ity that made it possible for Man 
to exist comfortably on Earth, 
but also the crystallization of all 
the sub-races that ever enabled an 
exploited people to feel that 
things could be worse, that rela- 
tive to the societal muck beneath 
them, they were, in spite of their 
sufferings, as lords and monarchs 
in comparison. 

N O wonder they stretched their 
arms frantically to him, the 
Servant of All, the World’s 
Drudge, the Slavey of Civiliza- 
tion, and screamed their trium- 
phant demand with one breath, 
their fearful plea with the next: 
“Serve us, Garomma! Serve us, 
serve us, serve us!” 

Didn’t the docile sheep he had 
herded as a boy in the Sixth Dis- 
trict mainland to the northwest, 
didn’t the sheep also feel that he 
was their servant as he led them 
and drove them to better pastures 
and cooler streams, as he protect- 
ed them from enemies and remov- 
ed pebbles from their feet, all to 
the end that their smoking flesh 
would taste better on his father’s 
table? But these so much more 
useful herds of two-legged, well- 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



brained sheep were as thoroughly 
domesticated. And on the simple 
principle they’d absorbed that 
government was the servant of 
the people and the highest power 
in the government was the most 
abysmal servant. 

His sheep. He smiled at them 
paternally, possessively, as his 
special vehicle rolled along the 
howling, face-filled mile between 
the Hovel of Service and the 
Educational Center. His sheep. 
And these policemen on motor- 
cycles, these policemen on foot 
whose arms were locked against 
the straining crowds every step of 
the way, these were his sheep- 
dogs. Another kind of domesti- 
cated animal. 

That’s all he had been, thirty- 
three years ago, when he’d landed 
on this island fresh from a rural 
Service of Security training school 
to take his first government job 
as a policeman in Capital City. 
A clumsy, over-excited sheep- 
dog. One of the least important 
sheep-dogs of the previous re- 
gime’s Servant of All. 

But three years later, the peas- 
ant revolt in his own district 
had given him his chance. With 
his special knowledge of the 
issues involved as well as the 
identity of the real leaders, he’d 
been able to play an important 
role in crushing the rebellion. 
And then, his new and important 
place in the Service of Security 



had enabled him to meet promis- 
ing youngsters in the other serv- 
ices — Moddo, particularly, the 
first and most useful human he 
had personally domesticated. 

With Moddo’s excellent ad- 
ministrative mind at his disposal, 
he had become an expert at the 
gracious art of political throat- 
cutting, so that when his superior 
made his bid for the highest office 
in the world, Garomma had been 
in the best possible position to 
sell him out and become the new 
Servant of Security. And from 
that point, with Moddo puffing 
along in his wake and working 
out the minutiae of strategy, it had 
been a matter of a few years be- 
fore he had been able to celebrate 
his own successful bid in the siz- 
zling wreckage of the preceding 
administration’s Hovel of Service. 

But the lesson he had taught 
the occupants of that blasted, 
projectile-ridden place he had 
determined never to forget him- 
self. He couldn’t know how many 
Servants of Security before him 
had used their office to reach the 
mighty wooden stool of the Serv- 
ant of All: after all, the history 
books, and all other books, were 
rewritten thoroughly at the be- 
ginning of every new regime; and 
the Oral Tradition, usually a good 
guide to the past if you could 
sift the facts out properly, was 
silent on this subject. It was ob- 
vious, however, that what he had

done, another could do — that the 
Servant of Security was the logi- 
cal, self-made heir to the Servant 
of All. 

A ND the trouble was you 
couldn’t do anything about 
the danger but be watchful. 

He remembered when his fa- 
ther had called him away from 
childhood games and led him out 
to the hills to tend the sheep. How 
he had hated the lonesome, tire- 
some work! The old man had 
realized it and, for once, had soft- 
ened sufficiently to attempt an 
explanation. 

“You see, son, sheep are what 
they call domestic animals. So are 
dogs. Well, we can domesticate 
sheep and we can domesticate 
dogs to guard the sheep, but for 
a smart, wide-awake shepherd 
who’ll know what to do when 
something real unusual comes up 
and will be able to tell us about 
it, well, for that we need a man.’’ 

“Gee, Pa,’’ he had said, kicking 
disconsolately at the enormous 
shepherd’s crook they’d given 
him, “then why don’t you — what- 
doyoucallit — domesticate a 
man?’’ 

His father had chuckled and 
then stared out heavily over the 
shaggy brow of the hill. “Well, 
there are people trying to do that, 
too, and they’re getting better at 
it all the time. The only trouble, 
once you’ve got him domesticat- 



ed, he isn’t worth beans as a shep- 
herd. He isn’t sharp and excited 
once he’s tamed. He isn’t inter- 
ested enough to be any use at 
all.” 

That was the problem in a nut- 
shell, Garomma reflected. The 
Servant of Security, by the very 
nature of his duties, could not be a 
domesticated animal. 

He had tried using sheep-dogs 
at the head of Security; over and 
over again he had tried them. But 
they were always inadequate and 
had to be replaced by men. And 
— one year, three years, five years 
in office — men sooner or later 
struck for supreme power and had 
to be regretfully destroyed. 

As the current Servant of Se- 
curity was about to be destroyed. 
The only trouble — the man was 
so damned useful! You had to 
time these things perfectly to get 
the maximum length of service 
from the rare, imaginative indi- 
vidual who filled the post to per- 
fection and yet cut him down 
the moment the danger outweigh- 
ed the value. And since, with the 
right man, the danger existed 
from the very start, you had to 
watch the scale carefully, unre- 
mittingly . 

Garomma sighed. This prob- 
lem was the only annoyance in 
a world that had been virtually 
machined to give him pleasure. 
But it was, inevitably, a problem 
that was with him always, even

in his dreams. Last night had 
been positively awful. 

Moddo touched his knee again 
to remind him that he was on 
exhibition. He shook himself and 
smiled his gratitude. One had to 
remember that dreams were only 
dreams. 

T hey had the crowds behind 
them now. Ahead, the great 
metal gate of the Educational 
Center swung slowly open and 
his car rumbled inside. As the 
motorcycle policemen swung off 
their two -wheelers with a smart 
sidewise flourish, the armed 
guards of the Service of Educa- 
tion in their crisp white tunics 
came to attention. Garomma, 
helped nervously by Moddo, 
clambered out of the car just as 
the Center Band, backed by the 
Center Choir, swung into the 
roaring, thrilling credo of Hu- 
manity's Hymn-. 

Garomma works day and 
night, 

Garomma's tasks are never 
light; 

Garomma lives in drudgery. 
For the sake of me, for the 
. sake of thee . .” 

After five verses, protocol hav- 
ing been satisfied, the band began 
The Song of Education and the 
Assistant Servant of Education, 
a poised, well-bred young man. 



♦came down the steps of the biv 
ing. His arm-spread and “Serve 
us, Garomma,’’ while perfunctory, 
was thoroughly correct. He stood 
to one side so that Garomma and 
Moddo could start up the steps 
and then swung in, straight- 
backed, behind them. The choir- 
master held the song on a high, 
worshipping note. 

They walked through the great 
archway with its carved motto. 
All Must Learn from the Serv- 
ant of All, and down the great 
central corridor of the immense 
building. The gray rags that Ga- 
romma and Moddo wore flapped 
about them. The walls were lined 
with minor employees chanting, 
“Serve us, Garomma. Serve us! 
Serve us! Serve us!” 

Not quite the insane fervor of 
the street mobs, Garomma re- 
flected, but entirely satisfactory 
paroxysms nonetheless. He bow- 
ed and stole a glance at Moddo 
beside him. He barely restrained 
a smile. The Servant of Educa- 
tion looked as nervous, as un- 
certain as ever. Poor Moddo! He 
was just not meant for such a 
high position. He carried his tall, 
husky body with all the elan of a 
tired berry-picker. He looked like 
anything but the most important 
official in the establishment. 

And that was one of the things 
that made him indispensable. 
Moddo was just bright enough 
to know his own inadequacy. 



THE SERVANT PROBLEM 



13 



Without Garomma, he’d still be 
checking statistical abstracts for 
interesting discrepancies in some 
minor department of the Service 
of Education. He knew he wasn’t 
strong enough to stand by him- 
self. Nor was he sufficiently out- 
going to make useful alliances. 
And so Moddo, alone of all the 
Servants in the Cabinet, could be 
trusted completely. 

In response to Moddo’s dif- 
fident touch on his shoulder, he 
walked into the large room that 
had been so extravagantly pre- 
pared for him and climbed the 
little cloth-of-gold platform at 
one end. He sat down on the 
rough wooden stool at the top; 
a moment later, Moddo took the 
chair that was one step down, 
and the Assistant Servant of Ed- 
ucation took the chair a further 
step below. The chief executives 
of the Educational Center, dress- 
ed in white tunics of the richest, 
most flowing cut, filed in slowly 
and stood before them. Garom- 
ma’s personal bodyguards lined 
up in front of the platform. 

And the ceremonies began. The 
ceremonies attendant upon com- 
plete control. 

t'lRST, the oldest official in the 
Service of Education recited 
the appropriate passages from 
the Oral Tradition. How every 
year, in every regime, far back 
almost to prehistoric democratic 



times, a psychometric sampling 
had been taken of elementary 
school graduating classes all over 
the world to determine exactly 
how successful the children’s po- 
litical conditioning had been. 

How every year there had been 
an overwhelming majority dis- 
closed which believed the cur- 
rent ruler was the very pivot of 
human welfare, the mainspring of 
daily life, and a small minority — 
five per cent, seven per cent, three 
per cent — which had successfully 
resisted indoctrination and 
which, as adults, were to be care- 
fully watched as potential sources 
of disaffection. 

How with the ascension of Ga- 
romma and his Servant of Edu- 
cation, Moddo, twenty-five years 
ago, a new era of intensive mass- 
conditioning, based on much 
more ambitious goals, had begun. 

The old man finished, bowed 
and moved back into the crowd. 
The Assistant Servant of Educa- 
tion rose and turned gracefully 
to face Garomma. He described 
these new goals which might be 
summed up in the phrase “com- 
plete control,’’ as opposed to pre- 
vious administrations’ out-dated 
satisfaction with 97% or 95% 
control, and discussed the new 
extensive fear mechanisms and 
stepped-up psychometric spot- 
checks in the earlier grades — ^by 
which they were to be achieved. 
These techniques had all been

! worked out by Moddo — “under 
the never-failing inspiration and 
constant guidance of Garomma, 
the Servant of All” — and had, in 
a few years, resulted in a sam- 
pling which showed the number 
of independent juvenile minds to 
be less than one per cent. All 
others worshiped Garomma with 
every breath they took. 

Thereafter, progress had been 
slower. They had absorbed the 
most brilliant children with the 
new conditioning process, but had 
hit the hard bedrock of the es- 
sential deviates, the psychologi- 
cal misfits whose personal mal- 
adjustments made it impossible 
for them to accept the prevailing 
attitudes of their social milieu, 
whatever these attitudes should 
happen to be. Over the years, 
techniques of conditioning had 
been painfully worked out which 
enabled even misfits to fit into 
society in the one respect of Ga- 
romma-worship and, over the 
years, the samplings indicated the 
negative doctrinal responses to 
be receding in the direction of 
zero: .016%, .007%, .0002%

uation day; collation and veri- 
fication had just been completed. 
The results: negative response 
was zero to the very last decimal 
place! Control was complete. 

S pontaneous applause 
broke out in the room, ap- 
plause in which even Garomma 
joined. Then he leaned forward 
and placed his hand paternally, 
possessively on Moddo’s head of 
unruly brown hair. At this un- 
usual honor to their chief, the 
officials in the room cheered. 

Under the noise, Garomma 
took the opportunity to ask Mod- 
do, “What does the population 
in general know about this? What 
exactly are you telling them?” 
Moddo turned his nervous, 
large-jawed face around. “Mostly 
just that it’s a holiday. A lot of 
obscure stuff about you achieving 
complete control of the human 
environment all to the end of 
human betterment. Barely enough 
so that they can know it’s some- 
thing you like and can rejoice 
with you.” 

“In their own slavery. I like 
that.” Garomma tasted the sweet 
flavor of unlimited rulership for 
a long moment. Then the taste 
went sour and he remembered. 
“Moddo, I want to take care of 
the Servant of Security matter 
this afternoon. We’ll go over it 
as soon as we start back.” 

The Servant of Education nod-

ded. “I have a few thoughts. It’s 
not so simple, you know. There’s 
the problem of the successor.”, 
“Yes. There’s always that. 
Well, maybe in a few more years, 
if we can sustain this sampling 
and spread the techniques to the 
maladjusted elements in the old- 
er adult population, we’ll be able 
to start dispensing with Security 
altogether.” 

“Maybe. Strongly set attitudes 
are much harder to adjust, 
though. And you’ll always need 
a security system in the top ranks 
of officialdom. But I’ll do the 
best — I’ll do the best I can.” 
Garomma nodded and sat back, 
satisfied. Moddo would always do 
his best. And on a purely rou- 
tine level, that was pretty good. 
He raised a hand negligently. 
The cheering and the applause 
stopped. Another Education ex- 
ecutive came forward to describe 
the sampling method in detail. 
The ceremony went on. 

was the day of complete 
control . 

Moddo, the Servant of Educa- 
tion, the Ragged Teacher of Man- 
kind, rubbed his aching forehead 
with huge, well-manicured fingers 
and allowed himself to luxuriate 
in the sensation of ultimate pow- 
er, absolute power, power such 
as no human being had even dar- 
ed to dream of before this day. 
Complete control. Complete... 



There was the one remaining 
problem of the successor to the 
Servant of Security. Garomma 
would want a decision from him 
as soon as they started back to 
the Hovel of Service; and he was 
nowhere near a decision. Either 
one of the two Assistant Serv- 
ants of Security would be able 
to fill the job admirably, but that 
wasn’t the question. 

The question was which one 
of the two men would be most 
likely to maintain at high pitch 
in Garomma the fears that Mod- 
do had conditioned him to feel 
over a period of thirty years? 

That, so far as Moddo was con- 
cerned, was the whole function of 
the Servant of Security; to serve 
as primary punching bag for the 
Servant of All’s fear-ridden sub- 
conscious until such time as the 
mental conflicts reached a peri- 
odic crisis. Then, by removing 
the man around whom they had 
been trained to revolve, the pres- 
sure would be temporarily eased. 

It was a little like fishing, Mod- 
do decided. You fed the fish ex- 
tra line by killing off the Servant 
of Security, and then you reeled 
it in quietly, steadily, in the next 
few years by surreptitiously drop- 
ping hints about the manifest am- 
bitions of his successor. Only you 
never wanted to land the fish. 
You merely wanted to keep it 
hooked and constantly under 
your control. 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The Servant of Education 
smiled an inch or two behind his 
face, as he had trained himself 
to smile since early boyhood. 
Landing the fish? That would 
be the equivalent of becoming 
Servant of All himself. And what 
intelligent man could satisfy his 
lust for power with such an idi- 
otic goal? 

No, leave that to his colleagues, 
the ragged high officials in the 
Hovel of Service, forever schem- 
ing and plotting, making alli- 
ances and counter-alliances. The 
Servant of Industry, the Servant 
of Agriculture, the Servant of 
Science and the rest of those 
highly important fools. 

To be the Servant of All meant 
being the target of plots, the very 
bull’s eye of attention. An able 
man in this society must inev- 
itably recognize that power — no 
matter how veiled or disguised 
— was the only valid aim in life. 
And the Servant of All — veiled 
and disguised though he might 
be in a hundred humbling ways 
— was power incarnate. 

N O. Far better to be known as 
the nervous, uncertain un- 
derling whose knees shook be- 
neath the weight of responsibil- 
ities far beyond his abilities. Had- 
n’t he heard their contemptuous 
voices behind his back? 

“. Garomma’s administra- 
tive toy . .” 



“. Garomma’s fool of a spiri- 
tual valet . .” 

“. nothing but a footstool, 
a very ubiquitous footstool, mind 
you, but a footstool nonetheless 
on which rests Garomma’s mighty 
heel . .” 

“. poor, colorless, jittery 
slob . .” 

“. when Garomma sneezes, 
Moddo sniffles . .” 

But from that menial, despised 
position, to be the real source of 
all policy, the maker and breaker 
of men, the de facto dictator of 
the human race . 

He brought his hand up once 
more and smoothed at his fore- 
head. The headache was getting 
worse. And the official celebra- 
tion of complete control was 
likely to take another hour yet. 
He should be able to steal away 
for twenty or thirty minutes with 
Loob the Healer, without get- 
ting Garomma too upset. The 
Servant of All had to be han- 
dled with especial care at these 
crisis points. The jitters that had 
been induced in him were likely 
to become so overpowering that 
he might try to make a frantic 
decision for himself. And that 
possibility, while fantastically 
dim, must not be given a chance 
to develop. It was too dangerous. 

For a moment, Moddo listened 
to the young man in front of them 
rattle on about modes and means, 
skew curves and correlation co-

efficients, all the statistical jar- 
gon that concealed the brilliance 
of the psychological revolution 
that he, Moddo, had wrought. 
Yes, they would be there another 
hour yet. 

Thirty-five years ago, while 
doing his thesis in the Central 
Service of Education Post-Grad- 
uate Training School, he had 
found a magnificent nugget in the 
accumulated slag of several cen- 
turies of mass-conditioning sta- 
tistics; the concept of individual 
application. 

*• For a long while, he had found 
the concept incredibly difficult 
to close with : when all your 
training has been directed toward 
the efficient handling of human 
attitudes in terms of millions, 
the consideration of one man’s 
attitudes and emotions is as slip- 
pery a proposition as an eel, 
freshly caught and moribundly 
energetic. 

"OUT after his thesis had been 

completed and accepted — ^the 
thesis on suggested techniques 
for the achievement of complete 
control which the previous ad- 
ministration had duly filed and 
forgotten — he had turned once 
more to the problem of individual 
conditioning. 

And in the next few years, while 
working at his dull job in the 
Applied Statistics Bureau of the 
Service of Education, he had 



addressed himself to the task of 
refining the individual from the 
group, of reducing the major to 
the minor. 

One thing became apparent. 
The younger your material, the 
easier your task — exactly as in 
mass-conditioning. But if you 
started with a child, it would be 
years before he would be able to 
operate effectively in the world on 
your behalf. And with a child 
you were faced with the constant 
counter-barrage of political con- 
ditioning which filled the early 
school years. 

What was needed was a young 
man who already had a place 
of sorts in the government, but 
who, for some reason or other, 
had a good deal of unrealized — 
and unconditioned — potential. 
Preferably, also, somebody whose 
background had created a per- 
sonality with fears and desires 
of a type which could serve as 
adequate steering handles. 

Moddo began to work nights, 
going over the records of his of- 
fice in search of that man. He 
had found two or three who 
looked good. That brilliant fel- 
low in the Service of Transport, 
he reminisced, had seemed awful- 
ly interesting for a time. Then 
he had come across Garomma’s 
papers. 

And Garomma had been per- 
fect. From the first. He was a 
directorial type, he was likable. 



T8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he was clever — and he was very 
receptive. 

“I could learn an awful lot 
from you,” he had told Moddo 
shyly at their first meeting. “This 
is such a big, complicated place 
— Capital Island. So much going 
on all the time. I get confused 
just thinking about it. But you 
were born here. You really seem 
to know your way around all the 
swamps and bogs and snake- 
pits.” 

Due to sloppy work on the part 
of the Sixth District Condition- 
ing Commissioner, Garomma’s 
home neighborhood had devel- 
oped a surprising number of 
quasi -independent minds on all 
levels of intelligence. Most of 
them tended to revolution, espe- 
cially after a decade of near- 
famine crops and exorbitant 
taxation. But Garomma had been 
ambitious; he had turned against 
his peasant background and en- 
tered the lower echelons of the 
Service of Security. 

T his meant that when the 
Sixth District Peasant Upris- 
ing occurred, his usefulness in its 
immediate suppression had earn- 
ed him a much higher place. 
More important, it had given 
him freedom from the surveil- 
lance and extra adult condition- 
ing which a man of his suspi- 
cious family associations might 
normally have expected. 



It also meant that, once Moddo 
had maneuvered an introduction 
and created a friendship, he had 
at his disposal not only a rising 
star but a personality that was 
superb in its plasticity. 

A personality upon which he 
could laboriously create the im- 
press of his own image. 

First, there had been that won- 
derful business of Garomma’s 
guilt about disobeying his father 
that had eventually led to his 
leaving the farm altogether — and 
later to his becoming an informer 
against his own family and neigh- 
bors. This guilt, which had re- 
sulted in fear and therefore 
hatred for everything associated 
with its original objects, was easy 
to redirect to the person of his 
superior, the Servant of Security, 
and make that the new father- 
image. 

Later, when Garomma had be- 
come Servant of All, he still re- 
tained — under Moddo’s tireless 
ministrations — the same guilt 

and the same omnipresent fear 
of punishment toward whoever 
was the reigning Head of Secur- 
ity. Which was necessary if he 
was not to realize that his real 
master was the large man who 
sat at his right hand, constantly 
looking nervous and uncertain... 

Then there had been education. 
And re-education. From the be- 
ginning, Moddo had realized the 
necessity of feeding Garomma’s 



THE SERVANT PROBLEM

petty peasant arrogance and had 
abased himself before it. He gave 
the other man the impression that 
the subversive thoughts he was 
now acquiring were of his own 
creation, even leading him to be- 
lieve that he was domesticating 
Moddo — curious how the fellow 
never escaped from his agricul- 
tural origins even in his meta- 
phors! — instead of the other way 
around. 

Because Moddo was now lay- 
ing plans for a tremendous fu- 
ture, and he didn’t want them 
upset some day by the cumu- 
lative resentment one may de- 
velop toward a master and 
teacher; on the contrary, he 
wanted the plans reinforced by 
the affection one feels toward a 
pet dog whose nuzzling depend- 
ence constantly feeds the ego and 
creates a more ferocious counter- 
dependence than the owner ever 
suspects. 

The shock that Garomma had 
exhibited when he began to rea- 
lize that the Servant of All was 
actually the Dictator of All! 
Moddo almost smiled with his 
lips at the memory. Well, after 
all, when his own parents had 
suggested the idea years ago in 
the course of a private sailing 
trip they took together pursuant 
to his father’s duties as a minor 
official in the Service of Fisheries 
and Marine— hadn’t he been so 
upset that he’d let go of the tiller 



and vomited over the side? Los- 
ing your religion is a hard thing 
at any age, but it gets much 
harder as you get older. 

On the other hand, Moddo had 
lost not only his religion at the 
age of six, but also his parents. 
They had done too much loose 
talking to too many people un- 
der the incorrect assumption that 
the then Servant of Security was 
going to be lax forever. 

’jri'E rubbed his knuckles into 
the side of his head. This 
headache was one of the worst 
he’d had in days! He needed fif- 
teen minutes at least — surely he 
could get away for fifteen min- 
utes — with Loob. The Healer 
would set him up for the rest of 
the day, which, on all appear- 
ances, was going to be a tiring 
one. And he had to get away from 
Garomma, anyway, long enough 
to come to a clear-headed, per- 
sonal decision on who was to be 
the next Servant of Security. 

Moddo, the Servant of Educa- 
tion, the Ragged Teacher of 
Mankind, took advantage of a 
pause between speakers to lean 
back and say to Garomma; “I 
have a few administrative mat- 
ters to check here before we start 
back. May I be excused? It — it 
won’t take more than about 
twenty or twenty-five minutes.” 
Garomma scowled imperiously 
straight ahead. “Can’t they wait? 



20 



galaxy science fiction 



This is your day as much as 
mine. I’d like to have you near 
me. 

“I know that, Garomma, and 
I’m grateful for the need. But” — 
and now he touched the Servant 
of All’s knee in supplication — “I 
beg of you to let me attend to 
them. They are very pressing. 
One of them has to do — it has to 
do indirectly with the Servant of 
Security and may help you de- 
cide whether you want to dis- 
pense with him at this particular 
time.” 

Garomma’s face immediately 
lost its bleakness. “In that case, 
by all means. But get back be- 
fore the ceremony is over. I want 
us to leave together.” 

The tall man nodded and rose. 
He turned to face his leader. 
“Serve us, Garomma,” he said 
with outstretched arms. “Serve 
us, serve us, serve us.” He backed 
out of the room, always facing 
the Servant of All. 

Out in the corridor, he strode 
rapidly through the saluting Cen- 
ter of Education guards and into 
his private elevator. He pressed 
the third-floor button. And then, 
as the door swept shut and the 
car began to rise, he permitted 
himself a single, gentle, mouth- 
curling smile. 

The trouble he had taken to 
pound that one concept into Ga- 
romma’s thick head: the basic 
principle in modern scientific 



government is to keep the gov- 
ernment so unobtrusive as to ap- 
pear non-existent, to use the 
illusion of freedom as a kind of 
lubricant for slipping on invisible 
shackles — above all, to rule in 
the name of anything but ruler- 
ship! 

A R O M M A himself had 

phrased it in his own la- 
borious fashion one day when, 
shortly after their great coup, 
they stood together — both still 
uncomfortable in the rags of 
greatness — and watched the con- 
struction of the new Hovel of 
Service in the charred place 
where the old one had stood for 
almost half a century. A huge, 
colorful, revolving sign on top of 
the unfinished building told the 
populace that from here will 
YOUR EVERY WANT AND NEED BE 
ATTENDED TO, FROM HERE WILL 
YOU BE SERVED MORE EFFICIENTLY 
AND PLEASANTLY THAN EVER BE- 
FORE. Garomma had stared at the 
sign which was being flashed on 
the video receivers of the world — 
in the homes as well as in fac- 
tories, offices, schools and com- 
pulsory communal gatherings — 
every hour on the hour. 

“It’s like my father used to 
say,” he told Moddo at last with 
the peculiar heavy chuckle he 
used to identify a thought he felt 
was entirely original; “the right 
kind of salesman, if he talks long

enough and hard enough, can 
convince a man that the thickest 
thorns feel as soft as roses. All 
he has to do is keep calling them 
roses, hey, Moddo?” 

Moddo had nodded slowly, 
pretending to be overcome by the 
brilliance of the analysis and sa- 
voring its complexities for a few 
moments. Then, as always, mere- 
ly appearing to be conducting an 
examination of the various latent 
possibilities in Garomma’s ideas, 
he had proceeded to give the new 
Servant of All a further lesson. 

He had underlined the neces- 
sity of avoiding all outward show 



of pomp and luxury, something 
the so-recently dead officials of 
the previous administration had 
tended to forget in the years be- 
fore their fall. He had pointed 
out that the Servants of Man- 
kind must constantly appear to 
be just that — the humble instru- 
ments of the larger mass will. 
Then anyone who. acted contrary 
to Garomma’s whim would be 
punished, not for disobeying his 
ruler, but for acting against the 
overwhelming majority of the

THE SERVANT PROBLEM

mind for a long time; the occa- 
sional creation of disasters in re- 
gions that had been uninterrupt- 
edly loyal and obedient. This 
would accentuate the fact that 
the Servant of All was very hu- 
man indeed, that his tasks were 
overwhelming and that he occa- 
sionally grew tired. 

This would intensify the im- 
pression that the job of coordi- 
nating the world’s goods and 
services had almost grown too 
complex to be handled success- 
fully. It would spur the various 
Districts on to uncalled-for prod- 
igies of frantic loyalty and self- 
regimentation, so that they at 
least would have the Servant of 
All’s maximum attention. 

“Of course,’’ Garomma had 
agreed. “That’s what I said. The 
whole point is not to let them 
know that you’re running their 
lives and that they’re helping you 
do it. You’re getting the idea.’’ 

He was getting the idea! He, 
Moddo, who ever since his ado- 
lescence had been studying a 
concept that had originated cen- 
turies ago when mankind had 
begun to emerge from the primi- 
tive chaos of self-rule and per- 
sonal decision into the organized 
social universe of modern times 
. ..he was getting the idea! 

TTE had smirked gratefully. 

But he had continued apply- 
ing to Garomma himself the tech- 



(. 

niques that he was teaching Ga- \ 
romma to apply to the mass of [ 
men as a whole. Year in, year 
out, seemingly absorbed in the 
immensities of the project he had 
undertaken on behalf of the 
Service of Education, he had ac- 
tually left its planning in the 
hands of subordinates while he 
concentrated on Garomma. 

And today, while superficially 
acquiring complete control over 
the minds of an entire generation 
of human beings, he had tasted 
for the first time complete con- 
trol over Garomma. For the past 
five years, he had been attempt- 
ing to crystallize his ascendancy 
in a form that was simpler to use 
than complicated need-mechan- 
isms and statement-patterns. 

Today, for the first time, the 
weary hours of delicate, stealthy 
conditioning had begun to work 
out perfectly. The hand-signal, 
the touch-stimulus that he had 
organized Garomma’s mind to 
respond to, had resulted in the 
desired responses every single 
time! 

As he walked down the third- 
floor corridor to Loob’s modest 
office, he searched for an ade- 
quate expression. It was like, he 
decided, being able to turn a 
whole vast liner by one touch on 
the wheel. The wheel activated 
the steering engine, the steering 
engine pushed against the enor- 
mous weight of rudder, and the 



rudder’s movements eventually 
forced the great ship to swing 
about and change its course. 

No, he reflected, let Garomma 
have his glorious moments and 
open adulation, his secret palaces 
and multitudes of concubines. 
He, Moddo, would settle for the 
single, occasional touch . and 
complete control. 

The anteroom to Loob’s office 
was empty. He stood there im- 
patiently for a moment, then 
called out: “Loob! Isn’t anyone 
taking care of this place? I’m in 
a hurry!” 

A plump little man with a tiny 
pointed beard on his chin came 
scurrying out of the other room. 
“My secretary — everyone had to 
go downstairs when the Servant 
of All entered — things are so dis- 
rupted — she hasn’t returned yet. 
But I was careful,” he went on, 
catching up to his own breath, 
“to cancel all my appointments 
with other patients while you 
were in the building. Please come 
in.” 

Moddo stretched himself out 
on the couch in the Healer’s of- 
fice. “I can only spare about — 
about fifteen minutes. I have a 
very important decision to make, 
and I have a headache that’s 
gouging out my — my brains.” 

Loob’s fingers circled Moddo’s 
neck and began massaging the 
back of his head with a serene 
purposefulness. “I’ll do what I 



can. Now try to relax. Relax. 
That’s right. Relax. Doesn’t this 
help?” 

“A lot,” Moddo sighed. He 
must find some way of working 
Loob into his personal entourage, 
to be with him whenever he had 
to travel with Garomma. The 
man was invaluable. It would be 
wonderful to have him always 
available in person. Just a mat- 
ter of conditioning Garomma to 
the thought. And now that could 
be handled with the same sugges- 
tion. “Do you mind if I just 
talk?” he inquired. “I don’t feel 
very much— very much like free 
association.” 

Loob sat down in the heavily 
upholstered chair behind the 
desk. “Do whatever you want. If 
you care to, go into what’s troub- 
ling you at the moment. All we 
can hope to do in fifteen minutes 
is help you relax.” 

Moddo began to talk. 

T his was the day of complete 
control. 

Loob, the Healer of Minds, the 
Assistant to the Third Assistant 
Servant of Education, threaded 
his fingers through the small, 
triangular beard that was his pro- 
fessional badge and allowed him- 
self to luxuriate in the sensation 
of ultimate power, absolute pow- 
er, power such as no human 
being had even dared to dream 
of before this day. ,

THE SERVANT PROBLEM 



25 



Complete control. Complete. 

It would have been extremely 
satisfying to have handled the 
Servant of Security matter di- 
rectly, but such pleasures would 
come in time. His technicians in 
the Bureau of Healing Research 
had almost solved the problem 
he had set them. Meanwhile he 
still had revenge and the enjoy- 
ment of unlimited dominion. 

He listened to Moddo talking 
of his difficulties in a carefully 
guarded, non-specific fashion and 
held up a round fat hand to 
cover his grin. The man actually 
believed that after seven years of 
close therapeutic relationship, he 
could conceal such details from 
Loob ! 

But of course. He had to be- 
lieve it. Loob had spent the first 
two years restructuring his en- 
tire psyche upon that belief, and 
then — and only then — had be- 
gun to effect transference on a 
total basis. While the emotions 
Moddo felt toward his parents in 
childhood were being duplicated 
relative to the Healer, Loob had 
begun to probe in the now un- 
suspicious mind. At first he 
hadn’t believed what the evidence 
suggested. Then, as he got to 
know the patient much better he 
became completely convinced 
and almost breathless at the 
scope of his windfall. 

For more than twenty-five 
years, Garomma, as the Servant 



of All, had ruled the human race, 
and for longer than that, Moddo, 
as a sort of glorified personal 
secretary, had controlled Ga- 
romma in every important re- 
spect. 

So, for the past five years, he, 
Loob, as psychotherapist and in- 
dispensable crutch to an uncer- 
tain, broken ego, had guided 
Moddo and thus reigned over the 
world, undisputed, unchallenged 
— and thoroughly unsuspected. 

The man behind the man be- 
hind the throne. What could be 
safer than that? 

course, it would be more 
efficient to fasten his thera- 
peutic grip directly on Garomma. 
But that would bring him out in 
the open far too much. Being the 
Servant of All’s personal mental 
physician would make him the 
object of jealous scrutiny by 
every scheming high-echelon 
cabal. 

No, it was better to be the one 
who had custody of the custo- 
dian, especially when the custo- 
dian appeared to be the most in- 
significant man in all the Hovel 
of Service officialdom. 

And then, some day, when his 
technicians had come up with the 
answer he required, he might dis- 
pose of the Servant of Education 
and control Garomma at first- 
hand, with the new method. 

He listened with amusement to 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Moddo discussing the Servant of 
Security matter in terms of a 
hypothetical individual in his 
own department who was about 
to be replaced. The question was 
which one of two extremely able 
subordinates should be given his 
job? 

Loob wondered if the patient 
had any idea how transparent his 
subterfuges were. No, they rarely 
did. This was a man whose up- 
set mind had been so manipu- 
lated that its continued sanity 
depended on two factors; the 
overpowering need to consult 
Loob whenever anything even 
mildly delicate came up, and the 
belief that he could be consulted 
without revealing the actual data 
of the situation. 

When the voice on the couch 
had come to the end of its rag- 
ged, wandering summation, Loob 
took over. Smoothly, quietly, al- 
most tonelessly, he reviewed what 
Moddo had said. On the surface, 
he was merely restating the con- 
cepts of his patient in a more co- 
herent way. Actually, he was 
reformulating them so that, con- 
sidering his personal problems 
and basic attitudes, the Servant 
of Education would have no al- 
ternative. He would have to se- 
lect the younger of the two 
candidates, the one whose back- 
ground had included the least 
opposition to the Healers Guild. 

Not that it made very much 

THE SERVANT PROBLEM 



difference. The important thing 
was the proof of complete con- 
trol. That was implicit in having 
made Moddo convince Garomma 
of the necessity of getting rid of 
a Servant of Security at a time 
when the Servant of All faced no 
particular mental crisis. When, 
in fact, his euphoria was at its 
height. 

But there was, admittedly, the 
additional pleasure in finally de- 
stroying the man who, years ago 
as Chief of the Forty-seventh 
District’s Security, had been re- 
sponsible for the execution of 
Loob’s only brother. The double 
achievement was as delicious as 
one of those two-flavor tarts for 
which the Healer’s birthplace 
was famous. He sighed reminis- 
cently. 

Moddo sat up on the couch. 
He pressed his large, spreading 
hands into the fabric on either 
side and stretched. “You’d be 
amazed how much help this one 
short session has been, Loob. 
The — the headache’s gone, the — 
the confusion’s gone. Just talking 
about it seems to clarify every- 
thing. I know exactly what I 
have to do now.” 

“Good,” drawled Loob the 
Healer in a gentle, carefully de- 
tached voice. 

“I’ll try to get back tomorrow 
for a full hour. And I’ve been 
thinking of having you transfer- 
red to my personal staff, so that 

27 



you can straighten out — straight- 
en out the kinks at the time they 
occur. I haven’t reached a deci- 
sion on it yet, though.” 

Loob shrugged and escorted his 
patient to the door. “That’s en- 
tirely up to you. However you 
feel I can help you most.” 

TTE watched the tall, husky 
man walking down the cor- 
ridor to the elevator. “I haven’t 
reached a decision on it yet, 
though.” Well, he wouldn’t — not 
until Loob did. Loob had put the 
idea into his mind six months 
ago, but had deferred having him 
take action on it. He wasn’t sure 
that it would be a good idea to 
get even that close to the Servant 
of All as yet. And there was that 
wonderful little project in the 
Bureau of Healing Research 
which he still wanted to give 
maximum daily attention. 

His secretary came in and went 
right to work at her typewriter. 
Loob decided to go downstairs 
and check on what had been done 
today. With all the fanfare at- 
tendant upon the Servant of 
All’s arrival to celebrate complete 
control, the researchers’ routine 
had no doubt been seriously in- 
terrupted. Still, the solution 
might come at any time. And he 
liked to examine their lines of 
investigation for potential fruit- 
fulness: these technicians were 
blunderingly unimaginative! 



As he walked down to the main 
floor, he wondered if Moddo, 
anywhere in the secret depths of 
his psyche, had any idea of 
how mueh he had come to de- 
pend on the Healer, how thor- 
oughly he needed him. The fel- 
low was such a tangle of anxiety 
and uncertainty — losing his par- 
ents as a child, the way he had, 
of course had not helped too 
much, but his many repressions 
had been in existence even then. 
He had never even remotely sus- 
pected that the reason he wanted 
Garomma to be the ostensible 
leader was because he was afraid 
of taking personal responsibility 
for anything. That the fake per- 
sonality he was proud of present- 
ing to the world was his real per- 
sonality, the difference being that 
he had learned to use his fears 
and timidity in a positive fash- 
ion. But only up to a point. Seven 
years ago, when he had looked 
up Loob (“a fast bit of psycho- 
therapy for some minor prob- 
lems I’ve been having”), he’d 
been on the point of complete 
collapse. Loob had repaired the 
vast flapping structure on a tem- 
porary basis and given it slightly 
different functions. Functions for 
Loob. 

He couldn’t help wondering 
further if the ancients would have 
been able to do anything basic 
for Moddo. The ancients, accord- 
ing to the Oral Tradition at least.

^ had developed, just before the 
beginning of the modern era, a 
psychotherapy that accomplished 
wonders of change and personal 
reorganization for the individual. 

But to what end? No serious 
attempt to use the method for its 
obvious purpose, for the only 
purpose of any method . 
power. Loob shook his head. 
Those ancients had been so in- 
credibly naive! And so much of 
their useful knowledge had been 
lost. Concepts like super-ego 
merely existed in the Oral Tradi- 
tion of the Healers Guild as 
words; there was no clue as to 
their original meaning. They 
might be very useful today, prop- 
erly applied. 

O N the other hand, were most 
of the members of his own 
modern Healers Guild across 
the wide sea, any less naive, in- 
cluding his father and the uncle 
who was now its reigning head? 
From the day when he had pass- 
ed the Guild’s final examinations 
and begun to grow the triangular 
beard of master status, Loob had 
seen that the ambitions of his 
fellow-members were ridiculous- 
ly limited. Here, in this very city, 
where, according to legend, the 
Guild of the Healers of Minds 
had originated, each member 
asked no more of life than to use 
his laboriously learned skill at 
transference to acquire power 



over the lives of ten or fifteen 
wealthy patients. 

Loob had laughed at these 
sparse objectives. He had seen 
the obvious goal which his col- 
leagues had been overlooking for 
years. The more powerful the in- 
dividual whom you subjected to 
transference and in whom you 
created a complete dependence, 
the more power you, as his heal- 
er, enjoyed. The world’s power 
center was on Capital Island 
across the great ocean to the east. 
And it was there that Loob de- 
termined to go. 

It hadn’t been easy. The strict 
rules of custom against changing 
your residence except on official 
business had stood in his way for 
a decade. But once the wife of the 
Forty-seventh District’s Com- 
munications Commissioner had 
become his patient, it got easier. 
When the commissioner had been 
called to Capital Island for pro- 
motion to the Second Assistant 
Servantship of Communication, 
Loob had gone with the family; 
he was now indispensable. 
Through them he had secured a 
minor job in the Service of Edu- 
cation. Through that job, prac- 
ticing his profession on the side, 
he had achieved enough notice 
to come to the august attention 
of the Servant of Education him- 
self. 

He hadn’t really expected to 
go this far. But a little luck, a

great deal of skill and constant, 
unwinking alertness had made an 
irresistible combination. Forty- 
five minutes after Moddo had 
first stretched out on his couch, 
Loob had realized that he, with 
all of his smallness and plump- 
ness and lack of distinction, was 
destined to rule the world. 

Now the only question was 
what to do with that rule. With 
wealth and power unlimited. 

TJ^ELL, for one thing there was 
** his little research project. 
That was very interesting, and 
it would serve, once it came to 
fruition, chiefly to consolidate 
and insure his power. There were 
dozens of little pleasures and 
properties that were now his, but 
their enjoyment tended to wear 
off with their acquisition. And 
finally there was knowledge. 

Knowledge. Especially forbid- 
den knowledge. He could now 
enjoy it with impunity. He could 
collate the various Oral Tradi- 
tions into one intelligible whole 
and be the only man in the world 
who knew what had really hap- 
pened in the past. He had al- 
ready discovered, through the 
several teams of workers he had 
set at the task, such tidbits as 
the original name of his birth- 
place, lost years ago in a num- 
bering system that had been 
created to destroy patriotic asso- 
ciations inimical to the world 



state. Long before it had been the ' 
Fifth City of the Forty-seventh j 
District, he had learned, it had ' 
been Austria, the glorious capital j 
of the proud Viennese Empire. I 
And this island on which he stood ! 
had been Havanacuba, no doubt I 
once a great empire in its own 
right which had established hege- 
mony over all other empires 
somewhere in the dim war-filled ^ 
beginnings of modern times. | 

Well, these were highly per- 
sonal satisfactions. He doubted i 
very much if Garomma, for ex- 
ample, would be interested to ' 
know that he hailed, not from the 
Twentieth Agricultural Region 1 
of the Sixth District, but from j 
a place called Canada, one of the 
forty-eight constituent republics 
of the ancient Northern United 
States of America. But he, Loob, 
was interested. Every additional 
bit of knowledge gave you addi- i 
tional power over your fellow- i 
men, that some day, some way, 
would be usable. 

Why, if Moddo had had any 
real knowledge of the transfer- 
ence techniques taught in the 
upper lodges of the Guild of the 
Healers of Minds, he might still 
be running the world himself! 
But no. It was inevitable that a 
Garomma should actually be no 
more than a creature, a thing, of 
Moddo. It was inevitable that a 
Moddo, given the peculiar forces 
that had formed him, should in- 



exorably have had to come to 
Loob and pass under his control. 

It was also inevitable that Loob, 
with his specialized knowledge 
of what could be done with the 
human mind, should be the only 
independent man on Earth to- 
day. It was also very pleasant. 

He wriggled a little bit, very 
satisfied with himself, gave his 
beard a final finger-comb, and 
pushed into the Bureau of Heal- 
ing Research. 

T he chief of the bureau came 
up rapidly and bowed. “Noth- 
ing new to report today.” He ges- 
tured at the tiny cubicles in 
which the technicians sat at old 
books or performed experiments 
on animals and criminally con- 
victed humans. “It took them a 
while to get back to work, after 
the Servant of All arrived. Every- 
one was ordered out into the 
main corridor for regulation em- 
pathizing with Garomma.” 

“I know,” Loob told him. “I 
don’t expect much progress on a 
day like this. Just so you keep 
them at it. It’s a big problem.” 
The other man shrugged enor- 
mously. “A problem which, as 
far as we can tell, has never been 
solved before. The ancient manu- 
scripts we’ve discovered are all 
in terrible shape, of course. But 
those -that mention hypnotism 
all agree that it can’t occur under 
any of the three conditions you 



want: against the individual’s 

will, contrary to his personal de- 
sires and best judgment, and 
maintaining him over a long 
period of time in the original state 
of subjection without need for 
new applications. I’m not saying 
it’s impossible, but — ” 

“But it’s very difficult. Well, 
you’ve had three and a half years 
to work on it, and you’ll have as 
much more time as you need. 
And equipment. And personnel. 
Just ask. Meanwhile, I’ll wander 
around and see how your men are 
doing. You needn’t come with 
me. I like to ask my own ques- 
tions.” 

The bureau chief bowed again 
and turned back to his desk in 
the rear of the room. Loob, the 
Healer of Minds, the Assistant 
to the Third Assistant Servant 
of Education, walked slowly from 
cubicle to cubicle, watching the 
work, asking questions, but most- 
ly noting the personal quality of 
the psychological technician in 
each cubicle. 

He was convinced that the 
right man could solve the prob- 
lem. And it was just a matter of 
finding the right man and giving 
him maximum facilities. The 
right man would be clever enough 
and persistent enough to follow 
up the right lines of research, 
but too unimaginative to be ap- 
palled by a goal which had eluded 
the best minds for ages.

THE SERVANT PROBLEM 



31 



And once the problem was 
solved — then in one short inter- 
view with Garomma, he could 
place the Servant of All under his 
direct, personal control for the 
rest of his life and dispense with 
the complications of long thera- 
peutic sessions with Moddo where 
he constantly had to suggest, and 
suggest in roundabout fashion, 
rather than give simple, clear 
and unambiguous orders. Once 
the problem was solved — 

He came to the last cubicle. 
The pimply-faced young man 
who sat at the plain brown table 
studying a ripped and damp- 
rotted volume didn’t hear him 
come in. Loob studied him for a 
moment. ' 

What frustrated, bleak lives 
these young technicians must 
lead! You could see it in the 
tightly set lines of their all-too- 
similar faces. Growing up in one 
of the most rigidly organized ver- 
sions of the world state that a 
ruler had yet contrived, they did- 
n’t have a thought that was in 
any way their own, could not 
dream of tasting a joy that had 
not been officially allotted to 
them. 

And yet this fellow was the 
brightest of the lot. If any one 
in the Bureau of Healing Re- 
search could develop the kind of 
perfect hypnotic technique Loob 
required, he could. Loob had 
been watching him with growing 



hope for a long time now. 

“How is it coming, Sidothi?’’ 
he asked. 

Sidothi looked up from his 
book. 

“Shut the door,’’ he said. 

Loob shut the door. 

^ I iH/S was the day of complete 

control . 

Sidothi, the Laboratory As- 
sistant, Psychological Technician 
Fifth Class, snapped his fingers 
in Loob’s face and allowed him- 
self to luxuriate in the sensation 
of ultimate power, absolute pow- 
er, power such as no human being 
had even dared to dream of be- 
fore this day. 

Complete control. Complete... 

Still sitting, he snapped his 
fingers again. 

He said: “Report.’’ 

The familiar glazed look came 
into Loob’s eyes. His body stiff- 
ened. His arms hung limply at his 
sides. In a steady, toneless voice 
he began to deliver his report. 

Magnificent. The Servant of 
Security would be dead in a few 
hours and the man Sidothi liked 
would take his place. For an ex- 
periment in complete control, it 
had worked out to perfection. 
That was all it had been; an at- 
tempt to find out if — by creating 
a feeling of vengefulness in Loob 
for the sake of a non-existent 
brother — he could force the Heal- 
er to act on a level he always

• wanted to avoid; making Moddo 
do something that the Servant 
of Education had no interest at 
' all in doing. That was to prod 
I Garomma into an action against 
the Servant of Security at a time 
when Garomma was in no par- 
ticular mental crisis. 

The experiment had worked 
perfectly. He’d pushed a little 
domino named Loob three days 
ago, and a whole series of other 
little dominoes had begun to fall 
one right after the other. Today, 
when the Servant of Security was 
strangled at his desk, the last one 
would have fallen. 

Yes, control was absolutely 
complete. 

Of course, there had been an- 
other, minor reason why he had 
elected to conduct this experi- 
ment in terms of the Servant of 
Security’s life. He didn’t like the 
man. He’d seen him drink a 
liqueur in public four years ago. 
Sidothi didn’t believe the Serv- 
ants of Mankind should do such 
things. They should lead clean, 
simple, abstemious lives; they 
should be an example to the rest 
of the human race. 

He’d never seen the Assistant 
Servant of Security whom he 
had ordered Loob to have pro- 
moted, but he had heard that 
the fellow lived very narrowly, 
without luxury even in private. 
Sidothi liked that. That was the 
way it should be. 



L oob came to the end of his 
report and stood waiting. Si- 
dothi wondered whether he should 
order him to give up this bad, 
boastful idea of controlling Ga- 
romma directly. No, that would- 
n’t do: that attitude led into the 
mechanism of coming down to 
the Bureau of Healing Research 
every day to check on progress. 
While a simple order to come in 
daily would suffice, still Sidothi 
felt that until he had examined 
all aspects of his power and be- 
come thoroughly familiar with its 
use, it was wise to leave original 
personality mechanisms in place, 
so long as they didn’t get in the 
way of anything important. 

And that reminded him. There 
was an interest of Loob’s which 
was sheer time-wasting. Now, 
when he was certain of absolute 
control, was a good time to get 
rid of it. 

“You will drop this research 
into historical facts,’’ he ordered. 
“You will use the time thus freed 
for further detailed examination 
of Moddo’s psychic weaknesses. 
And you will find that more in- 
teresting than studying the past. 
That is all.” 

He snapped his fingers in 
Loob’s face, waited a moment, 
then snapped them again. The 
Healer of Minds took a deep 
breath, straightened and smiled. 

“Well, keep at it,” he said, en- 
couragingly. 



THE SERVANT PROBLEM 



33 



“Thank you, sir, I will,” Si- 
dothi assured him. 

Loob opened the door of the 
cubicle and walked out, pomp- 
ously, serenely. Sidothi stared af- 
ter him. The idiotic assurance of 
the man — that once the process 
of complete control by hypnotic 
technique was discovered, it 
would be given to Loob! 

Sidothi had begun to reach the 
answer three years ago. He had 
immediately covered up, letting 
his work take a superficially dif- 
ferent line. Then, when he had the 
technique perfected, he’d used it 
on Loob himself. Naturally. 

At first he’d been shocked, al- 
most sickened, when he found 
out how Loob controlled Moddo, 
how Moddo controlled Garomma, 
the Servant of All. But after a 
while, he’d adjusted to the situa- 
tion well enough. After all, ever 
since the primary grades, the 
only reality he and his contem- 
poraries had accepted completely 
was the reality of power. Power 
in each class, in each club, in 
each and every gathering of hu- 
man beings, was the only thing 
worth fighting for. And you chose 
an occupation not only because 
you were most fitted for it, but 
because it gave the greatest prom- 
ise of power to a person of your 
particular interests and aptitudes. 

But he’d never dreamed of, 
never imagined, this much power! 
Well, he had it. That was reality. 



and reality was to be respected 
above all else. Now the problem 
was what to do with his power. 

And that was a very hard ques- 
tion to answer. But the answer 
would come in time. Meanwhile, 
there was the wonderful chance 
to make certain that everyone 
did his job right, that bad people 
were punished. He intended to 
stay in his menial job until the 
proper time came for promotion. 
There was no need at the moment 
to have a big title. If Garomma 
could rule as the Servant of All, 
he could rule Garomma at third 
or fourth hand as a simple Psy- 
chological Technician Fifth Class. 

But in what way exactly did 
he want to rule Garomma What 
important things did he want to 
make Garomma do? 

A BELL rang. A voice called 
out of loudspeaker set high 
in the wall. “Attention! Atten- 
tion, all personnel! The Servant 
of All will be leaving the Center 
in a few minutes. Everyone to the 
main corridor to beg for his con- 
tinued service to mankind. Ev- 
eryone — ” 

Sidothi joined the mob of tech- 
nicians pouring out of the huge 
laboratory room. People were 
coming out of offices on both sides 
of them. He was swept up with a 
crowd constantly enlarging from 
the elevators and stairways to the 
main corridor where the Service

THE SERVANT PROBLEM

of Education guards prodded 
them and jammed them against 
the walls. 

He smiled. If they only knew 
whom they were pushing! Their 
ruler, who could have any one 
of them executed. The only man 
in the world who could do any- 
thing he wanted to do. Anything. 

There was sudden swirling 
movement and a cheer at the far 
distant end of the corridor. Ev- 
eryone began to shuffle about 
nervously, everyone tried to stand 
on tip-toe in order to see better. 
Even the guards began to breathe 
faster. 

The Servant of All was coming. 

The cries grew more numerous, 
more loud. People in front of 
them were heaving about madly. 
And suddenly Sidothi saw him! 

His arms went up and out in a 
flashing paroxysm of muscles. 
Something tremendous and de- 
lighted seemed to press on his 
chest and his voice screamed, 
“Serve us, Garomma! Serve us! 
Serve us! Serve us!” He was suf- 
fused with heaving waves of love, 
love such as he never knew any- 
where else, love for Garomma, 
love for Garomma’s parents, love 
for Garomma’s children, love for 
anything and everything con- 
nected with Garomma. His body 
writhed, almost without coordi- 



nation, delicious flames licked up 
his thighs and out from his arm- 
pits, he twisted and turned, 
danced and hopped, his very 
stomach seeming to strain against 
his diaphragm in an attempt to 
express its devotion. None of 
which was very strange, consid- 
ering that these phenomena had 
been conditioned in him since 
early childhood . 

“Serve us, Garomma!” he 
shrieked, bubbles of saliva grow- 
ing out of the corner of his mouth. 
“Serve us! Serve us! Serve us!” 

He fell forward, between two 
guards, and his outstretched fin- 
gertips touched a rustling flap- 
ping rag just as the Servant of 
All strode by. His mind abruptly 
roared off into the furthest, most 
hidden places of ecstasy. He faint- 
ed, still babbling. “Serve us, O 
Garomma.” 

When it was all over, his fel- 
low-technicians helped him back 
to the Bureau of Healing Re- 
search. They looked at him with 
awe. It wasn’t every day you 
managed to touch one of Garom- 
ma’s rags. What it must do to a 
person! 

It took Sidothi almost half an 
hour to recover. 

THIS WAS THE DAY OF 
COMPLETE CONTROL.

I CAN no longer keep my ter- 
rible secret, although the 
thought of what will hap- 
pen to me, when I tell my story, 
gives me a trembling from head 
to toe. Without doubt, word will 
flash to the proper authorities and 
stem-faced men with sympathet- 
ic eyes will bring strait jacket and 
sedatives, and hunt me down to 
tear me from Mary’s clinging 
arms. A padded cell will be made 
ready for another unfortunate. 
Nevertheless what we have 



just read in the newspapers has 
made us fearfully agree that I 
must tell all> regardless of my 
own fate. So let me say this: 

If it is true that an expedition 
is being organized in London to 
go to the cold and rocky wastes 
of the Himalayas for the pur- 
pose of investigating that aston- 
ishing primeval creature called 
‘The Abominable Snowman,’ 
then I am forced to tell you im- 
mediately . the Abominable 
Snowman is none other than Mr. 



DON'T SHOOT 



37 




i 



Eammer, the famous movie mag- 
nate. 

And I am the one responsible 
for this amazing situation. I and 
my invention which Mr. Eammer 
had hired me to develop, an in- 
vention which would put 3-D and 
Cinemascope and the new Lar- 
goscope process so far behind in 
the fierce Hollywood battle for 
supremacy that Mr. Eammer 
would at last have complete con- 
trol of the industry, and, for that 
matter, television also. 

You will say this is impossible 
because one or two glimpses of 
the Abominable Snowman have 
shown it to be an apelike crea- 
ture? 

And the animal’s body is cov- 
ered with thick, coarse hair? 

Well, did you ever see Mr. 
Eammer lounging beside his ela- 
borate Beverly Hills swimming 
pool? He looks as if he’s just 
climbed down from a tree. The 
last young movie lovely an agent 
had brought around to talk con- 
tracts took one look, screamed 
and fainted. It is said she was 
hysterical for two days. 

B ut let me tell how it all 
started. Remember those 
awful days when television, like 
a monster with a wild pituitary 
gland, grew until it took the word 
‘colossal’ away from filmdom? 
What a battle! Like two giant 
bears rearing up face to face, 



roaring, screaming, swapping ter- 
rible blows of mighty paws, the 
two industries fought, with the 
film industry reeling bloodily, at 
first, then rallying with 3-D, then 
Cinemascope, and television 
pressing home the fierce attack 
with color TV. 

And who was caught in the 
middle of all this, without any 
protection? Mr. Eammer. Why? 
Well, let me give you some back- 
ground on that character. When 
talkies killed the era of silent 
films, Mr. Eammer nearly got 
shaken loose in the change. He’d 
scornfully dismissed the new de- 
velopment. 

“Ha,” he'd said. “People come 
to my movies for one of two 
things. To fall asleep, or to look 
at the pretty girlies.” 

When the movie industry be- 
gan to look for good stories and 
material that stimulated the 
mind as well as the emotion, Mr. 
Eammer had jeered. “Ha. People 
are stupid, people are sheep. 
They don’t want to think, they 
just want to see the pretty gir- 
lies.” 

Six months later, Mr. Eammer 
had sent emissaries to England 
to try to hire this guy Billy 
Shakespeare. “Offer him any- 
thing,” ordered Mr. Eammer 
grimly. “Tell him we’ll fill the 
water cooler in his office with 
gin, he can pick any secretary he 
likes from among our starlets. 



DON'T SHOOT 



39 




and . and . he swallowed, 
then recklessly added, “we’ll even 
give him screen credit.” 

Of course the men he’d sent 
out searching knew Billy Shakes- 
peare had kicked off, though 
they weren’t sure whether it was 
last year or ten years ago. But 
it was a fine trip on the expense 
account and after a few weeks of 
riotous searching in London’s 
gayer areas, they wired that 
Shakespeare had caught a bad 
cold, the penicillin had run out 
and he’d not lasted the night. 

But Mr. Eammer pulled out 
of his situation. He bought up 
just the right to use the titles of 
great classic novels, ignored the 
contents, and had entirely differ- 
ent stories written. 

“Not enough girlies in their 
versions,” he explained, frown- 
ing. “Them hack writers don’t 
have stuff with real interest to it.” 

T> Y the time the customers were 
in the packed movie houses, 
they were so stunned with the 
spectacle of unclad femininity 
that they’d completely forgotten 
what they’d come to see. Half of 
them had never read the classics 
anyway. 

So the dough rolled in and Mr. 
Eammer’s estate was photo- 
graphed in color and published 
in ‘ Beautiful Homes” magazines, 
and high school newspapers sent 
nervous young reporters to ask 



advice for graduates yearning to 
get into the movie business. How, 
they asked humbly, could they 
carve a place for themselves? 

Mr. Eammer beamed and said, 
“Girlies. Use plenty of girlies. 
It gets them every time.” 

The printed interview, as ap- 
proved and edited by high school 
faculty advisors, did not contain 
this advice. 

But the girlies weren’t enough 
to save Mr. Eammer when tele- 
vision hit the movies on its glass 
jaw. He didn’t believe what was 
happening, until it was too late. 
When his studio started hitting 
the skids, he hastily withdrew 
funds and liquidated assets and 
rented a number of safe-deposit 
boxes. Then he sat back and let 
his creditors scream a symphony 
of threats. 

It was at that time that Mr. 
Eammer heard that I, a young 
physicist interested in optics, had 
stumbled across an oddity which 
might revolutionize the movie in- 
ydustry. He’d heard of this 
Wrough Mary, whom I love with 
ajll my heart, and who will some- 
times embarrass me by proudly 
telling people how intelligent I 
arrl. 

Mr. Eammer’s secretary, she 
let Him know all about me, just 
as she\let me know all I have 
just told^you about him. Mary 
is not a reticent person; she is 
too loving of her fellow man to 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




withhold even the slightest in- 
formation and perhaps I should 
have kept my astonishing discov- 
ery to myself. 

In any case the phone rang in 
my very small laboratory one 
day and Mary’s excited voice 
said, “Joe, darling. It’s me. I told 
him about your invention. Come 
down right away.” 

“Who?” I said. “Where? What 
are you talking about?” 

“To the studio,” she said im- 
patiently. “To see my boss, Mr. 
Eammer. He says if your inven- 
tion is . .” 

“Now wait a minute,” I shout- 
ed with indignation. “I told you 
not to tell anybody about it. It’s 
not perfected. In fact, I don’t 
understand how it works ex- 
actly.” 

“Stop being so modest,” she 
said firmly. “I know you. You’re 
a genius and genius is never, 
never satisfied. I read all about 
it. You want us to get married, 
don’t you?” 

“Yes,” I said, sudden longing 
surging through my heart. 

“Can we afford to? No. So 
come on down. Anyway, I al- 
ready told him. Don’t make me 
into a ... a liar,” begged Mary. 
“If he likes your invention, may- 
be he’ll buy it.” 

^T^HE things we do for the wom- 
en we love. I went there in 
fear and was trembling with good 



reason. Not knowing quite how 
my invention operated, it could 
be stolen from me, because it 
might not be patentable. It was 
more discovery than invention. 

Oh, I can tell you, I went to 
see Mr. Eammer in a cold sweat 
of fear that I might be losing my 
hold on the strange and acci- 
dental phenomena across which 
I’d stumbled. 

I got quite a greeting. 

When I walked into his elabor- 
ate outer offices, the workers were 
sitting hushed in fear before their 
desks. From within his private 
offices I could hear bellowing and 
the sounds of things smashing. 

Mary hurried over to me, her 
warm, brown eyes pleading. Be- 
fore she could say anything, I 
heard Mr. Eammer say in a 
shout, right through the partly 
opened door, “Well, what have 
you done about it?” 

A trembling voice said, “Sir, 
I’ve cut staff fifty per cent.” 

“Stupid!” roared Mr. Eam- 
mer's voice. “Who’s talking about 
that? Did you ask Peterson of 
World Studios if he’ll license us 
to use his new Largoscope sys- 
tem?” 

“Y-yes.” A moment of terrified 
silence. “He s-said your outfit 
could use his Largoscope on only 
one occasion. When they f-film 
your funeral.” 

There was a gasp, then the 
door opened and a perspiring. 



DON'T SHOOT 



41 



harried, bald-headed man lurch- 
ed out. With glazed eyes, he made 
a beeline for the outer door. 

“Let’s go in,” said Mary eager- 
ly. “He’ll be so glad to see you.” 

I looked at her incredulously, 
but she took my arm and drag- 
ged me inside. There Mr. Eam- 
mer sat twitching and shudder- 
ing, his head in his pudgy hands. 

He looked dully at us from 
tiny eyes. “Everybody hates my 
genius,” he said, waggling his 
head from side to side. “Every- 
body envies me. The wild dogs 
are gathering to pull down the 
noble elk.” 

As he glared at us, Mary said 
swiftly, “Yes, sir.” 

“The wounded lion,” whis- 
pered Mr. Eammer dramatically, 
tears of self-pity coming to his 
eyes. “Surrounded by jackals and 
laughing hyenas. I am dying of 
my wounds.” He uttered a wail. 
“Everybody’s got a new filming 
system but me.” He drew a deep 
breath. “Who the hell are you?” 
he demanded. 

“He’s . .” began Mary. 

“Wait a minute,” he said. He 
grabbed a phone from the six on 
his desk. “Hey. Publicity . 
Hey, Mike. I want rumors spread 
about Largoscope. Top doctors 
say it’ll ruin the eyes, make you 
stone blind.” He paused, his face 
purpling. “Okay, if you can’t do 
it, then get another job. You’re 
fired.” 



He slammed the phone down. 
“No cooperation from anybody,” 
he said heavily. “Surrounded by 
incompetents.” He glared at me. 
“Who the hell are you?” 

“I’m ...” I began. 

A T this moment, the door 
opened and in came a man 
with a sheaf of papers and a film 
of sweat on his forehead. “I hate 
to interrupt, Mr. Eammer,” he \ 
said doggedly, “but I got your 
note on the Lolita Vaughn con- 
tract we drew up. I knew there ; 
must be some mistake, so . ; 

“Mistake, what kind of mis- ‘ 
take?” snapped Mr. Eammer. “I 
want you to tear the contract up. j 
I said we aren’t going to sign 
after all. I got a bigger name for 
the picture than her.” 

The man winced. “Well,” he 
said. “I ... I was just wonder- ■ 
ing. I mean, after all, we talked 
her into turning down that fat 
part in the new Broadway show 
that opened last night. It’s a 
smash hit, I read today . .” : 

“Tough,” shouted Mr. Eam- 
mer. “My heart bleeds. Did I i 
know when I made that promise , 
that I could get a big star at such ' 
a cheap price? I acted hastily, I , 
made a mistake, so I corrected i 
that mistake.” He looked stern. 1 
“Would it be fair to the stock- I 
holders if I took Lolita under 
these conditions?” 

“But you own all the stock!” 



“That’s what I said, you fool!” 
roared Mr. Eammer. “Get out 
of here.” 

As the man fled, I stared at 
Mr. Eammer in horror and dis- 
gust. Never would I trust a man 
like this, was my thought. 

He glared at me. “Who the hell 
are you?” he snarled. “I keep 
asking you and you stand there 
like a dummy.” 

“He’s the scientist I told you 
about,” said Mary. “He’s a ge- 
nius. He has a new invention that 
will make Largoscope obsolete.” 
“This?” said the producer with 
incredulity. “This beanpole is a 
scientist? I don’t believe it.” He 
stared morosely at me, shaking 
his head. “He looks like an ele- 
vator operator who can’t figure 
out what button to push.” 

“I beg your pardon!” I said 
with indignation. “I am a gradu- 
ate of M.I.T. I graduated sutnma 
cum laude." 

“Anybody can pick up a few 
words of French,” he sneered. 
“If you’re such a genius, how 
much money have you got, hah?” 
As I looked at him numbly, my 
jaw hanging open, he tapped his 
chest with a sausagelike fore- 
finger. “Now I am a genius, see? 
I’m the guy who hires you. Now 
tliat we got that straight, what’s 
this nonsense about you being 
smart enough to figure out a new 
invention that will make Largo- 
scope obsolete?” 



The weary cynicism in his 
gross face enraged me. If ever I 
had an immediate yearning to 
crush a man, to make him say 
‘uncle,’ to have him beg and 
yearn, it was at that moment and 
toward this insufferable moron. 

W ITHIN half an hour, we 
had driven back to my 
small laboratory. He peered sus- 
piciously at the involved maze 
of wiring and electronic equip- 
ment. I pointed to the small un- 
roofed cabinet on my long work- 
table. It was two feet deep and 
the four walls, which were three 
feet long, were studded with small 
tubes I’d rather not describe, 
since I’ve developed them myself 
and they produce a new kind of 
ray. 

“That’s my camera,” I said. 
“It looks more like a diathermy 
machine or a sweatbox for re- 
ducing,” he said skeptically. 
“How’s it operate?” 

I set a few dials and went to 
find Susie, my white cat. “Here 
pussy, pussy,” I said tenderly. 

“The man’s gone nuts,” said 
Mr. Eammer in disgust. 

“Take it easy,” I snapped. 
“That’s how I made my strange 
discovery. I was doing a test on 
the effect of a new kind of radia- 
tion on fabrics. And Susie, my 
cat, walked over the equipment. 
First she stepped on a dial, turn- 
ing it accidentally to full power. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

43 



then she wandered into the box.” 

‘‘So what?” 

‘‘Watch and see,” I said. 

I got Susie and she complac- 
ently allowed herself to be put 
into the box. I placed Mary at 
the dials with instructions and 
took Mr. Eammer to the next 
room and pointed to a huge circle 
chalked on the floor. The movie 
magnate waited impatiently. 

‘‘Mary,” I shouted. ‘‘Okay. 
Turn dial number one to full 
force.” 

We heard a click. 

Then Mr. Eammer yelped and 
cowered behind me. Because in 
front of us, within the chalked 
circle, appeared a giant eight- 
foot-tall cat, an enormous dup- 
licate of Susie. Susie was licking 
her paw with a tongue that was 
nearly two feet long. 

“Don’t be afraid,”! said proud- 
ly. “It’s just an image. Look.” I 
stepped forward and ran my hand 
through the air where the giant 
figure of Susie ignored me. My 
hand disappeared into the image, 
and I felt the usual puzzling 
tingle, as if I were getting a 
shock. And Susie, from the next 
room, uttered a faint meow and 
stopped licking her paw as if she, 
too, felt something. 

“But , . but there’s no screen,” 
Eammer said. “And . and it 
looks real. It’s got three dimen- 
sions like an actual body.” He 
cautiously approached, his hands 



shaking with excitement. He tip- 
toed around behind the cat image. 
He choked, “It’s like a real, liv- 
ing cat all around.” 

“You haven’t seen anything 
yet,” I said happily. “Watch this. 
Mary,” I yelled again. “Turn 
dial number two very slowly.” 

A S we stared, the image of 
the three-dimensional Susie 
shrank from eight feet all the way 
down to a three-dimensional 
miniature cat the size of a thim- 
ble. 

Mr. Eammer looked as if he 
might faint. 

“Good-by, Largoscope,” I said 
grimly. “This will make all 3-D 
and large screen systems obso- 
lete. It will revolutionize tele- 
vision, too. People will sit home 
and see actual figures, three- 
dimensional figures of real people. 
There will be no screens at all. 
The effects of depth and solidity, 
as you see, are perfect . .” 

Suddenly Susie in the next 
room gave a yelping meow arid 
Mary gasped. We jumped, then 
ran inside. Mary was wringing 
her hand. There was a little 
smoke in the room. 

“My hand hit a wire,” said 
Mary, embarrassed. “I guess I 
caused a short circuit or some- 
thing. I’m sorry. All this smoke.” 
She put her hands to her eyes, 
rubbing. 

“Susie all right?” I said. 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I guess so,” she said. “She 
moved so fast I could hardly 
see . • 

“My dear fellow.” Mr. Eam- 
mer was most cordial. He put 
his arm around my shoulders. 
He was beaming at me. He was 
offering me a fat cigar. “What a 
wonderful invention. You are in- 
deed a genius and I offer you my 
humblest apologies.” 

“I accept them,” I said, push- 
ing him away with distaste. “You 
may leave now, Mr. Eammer.” 
“Leave? Not until we’ve signed 
a contract, my friend. I want that 
invention.” 

“Mr. Eammer, that invention 
isn’t perfected yet. I don’t even 
know how it works. The prin- 
ciples are beyond me. It is some- 
thing new in the world of physics 
and optics, and . .” 

“That’s all right,” he cried. “I’ll 
give you six months. A year. 
More. But I want it . .” 

“No. I’m afraid I don’t trust 
you,” I said. 

Far from being offended, he 
was delighted. He laughed as if 
I’d said something witty. “Of 
course you don’t,” he said. “You 
don’t trust me and you don’t like 
me. But just listen to my offer.” 

R ight then and there Mr. 

Eammer made an offer that 
had my head swimming. He 
would, first of all, deposit in an 
account in my name the sum of 



one million dollars — free of taxes. 
Second, he would include in the 
contract a stipulation that I’d get 
fifty per cent of all royalties. 
Third — and very important to 
me — in the event that the patent 
he would apply for in my name 
was refused, or if it was broken 
by further research, I could keep 
the million dollars. 

“And last,” said Mr. Eammer, 
his nostrils flaring as he closed 
in for the kill, “I’ll make your 
girl friend, Mary, a big movie 
star.” 

Mary’s eyes widened. She 
clasped her hands before her, 
nervously. “Me?” she whispered. 
“B-but I can’t act.” 

“What’s that got to do with 
it?” Mr. Eammer asked impa- 
tiently. “You just got to hold still 
when the male lead grabs you. 
Leave it all to him, he knows 
what to do.” 

“No,” I cried, appalled. “I 
don’t want anybody else kissing 
Mary.” 

“Neither do I,” said Mary, 
blushing. 

“You’re absolutely right.” Mr. 
Eammer uttered a deep sigh. 
“Such deep love, such clean emo- 
tion, it cuts my heart out, honest- 
ly. Okay, we’ll give the script a 
scrubbing. Nobody’ll put a finger 
on her.” 

“I don’t think I’m interested,” 
said Mary regretfully. 

Mr. Eammer was staggered. 



DON'T SHOOT 



45 






He recovered immediately and 
said hastily, "Smart girl. What 
intelligence. It’s no life for you.” 

“But, Mary,” I said, kind of 
liking the idea of my Mary on 
the screen; of being sole ow^ner 
of her sweetness with millions of 
people knowing nobody could 
kiss this girl but myself. “It’s 
such a rare opportunity. Every 
girl wants to be a movie star. 
Do it!” 

“Sure,” cried Mr. Eammer. 
“Don’t be a dope. How many 
girls get a chance like this?” 

Mary whispered, her eyes shin- 
ing, “Well, all right, dear, if you 
insist.” 

“You have a deal, Mr. Eam- 
mer,” I said quickly. 

Mary typed the contract on 
my portable as dictated by Mr. 
Eammer. 

“Put in a clause,” I said cau- 
tiously, remembering his ethics, 
“that the contract is effective only 
when the million is deposited in 
my account.” 

Mr. Eammer frowned. “Put in 
a clause for me, too,” he said. 
“He can’t draw on the million 
without a signed receipt from me 
saying he’s delivered all his blue- 
prints and technical notebooks 
on the invention — and a full- 
size camera model, big enough 
to hold people.” 

“I agree,” I said. “I’ll have it 
built and delivered immediately.” 

I shook Mr. Eammer’s clammy 



hand and he departed with Mary 
to get the million dollars out of 
his secret safe-deposit boxes. 

T STARED dreamily after 
them, mentally spending that 
money on all the wonderful 
things I’d always wanted. A 
scintillometer. A centrifuge. May- 
be I could even build my own 
private cyclotron. And I could 
visualize Mary cooking dinner in 
a little white cottage with a 
picket fence. 

Within the week, I had deliv- 
ered the full-size camera to Mr. 
Eammer’s studio. As he left me, 
whimpering with joy and care- 
fully locking the iron doors of the 
room he’d set aside for my equip- 
ment, I stared at the signed re- 
ceipt in my hand. A million dol- 
lars. I was rich. 

At this moment, Mary appear- 
ed at the studio gate and ran 
toward me, her face deathly pale. 
“What’s the matter?” I cried. 
“Remember how we couldn’t 
find Susie all week?” she gasped. 
“Well, I just found her.” 

Mary held out her fist, opened 
her fingers and I recoiled in as- 
tonishment. In her palm was 
Susie, my cat. But a Susie that 
was one inch long ... the small- 
est, tiniest cat I’d ever seen. She 
was alive and seemed healthy as 
she licked her white fur and ut- 
tered a meow I barely could hear. 
My throat was so dry I could

hardly get the words out. “Good 
Lord. The invention. Something 
went wrong. It not only sends the 
itnaie in three dimensions with- 
out a screen to receive it; it also 
transmits the actual body itself 
through space. I’ve created a 
matter transmitter.” 

“But . but why is Susie so 
small?” wailed Mary. 

“Apparently it transmits what- 
ever size the image is set at. Re- 
member we had reduced the 
image of Susie and at that time 
you short-circuited the wires? 
That short circuit is what did it. 
If Susie’s image had been large 
at that moment, we would have 
had an eight-foot -tall cat on our 
hands . .” 

I paused appalled, my eyes 
clinging to the incredible one- 
inch cat now peering over the 
edge of Mary’s hand at the 
ground below. It shrank back 
fearfully. 

“My God,” I whispered. I 
turned and, with Mary close be- 
hind me, made a beeline for Mr. 
Eammer. 

W E finally found him and got 
him alone. Mary opened 
her palm and, without a word, 
showed him Susie. Mr. Eammer’s 
eyes bulged and his jowls turned 
ashen. Susie scratched her ear 
with her miniature rear left foot 
and I idly wondered just how 
small Susie’s fleas were. 



“I warned you,” I said grimly, 
“that I didn’t know how this 
thing worked or the principles 
behind it. This is what’s liable 
to happen whenever there is a 
short circuit in the camera box. 

I don’t know why it happens, but 
it’s too dangerous to use. If you 
want to call off our deal . .” 

“No, no, no,” said Mr. Eam- 
mer rapidly. A cunning look came 
over his face. “I’m sure you can 
work the bugs out of it, can’t 
you? I’m sure you’re anxious to 
do more research on it?” 

“Indeed, I am,” I said warmly. 
“You are a man with the true 
scientific spirit.” 

“Go right to work,” he said 
urgently, his fascinated eyes 
never leaving Susie. “Work night 
and day, day and night. I’ll never 
leave your side. We must learn 
how this gadget works.” 

That’s what we did. Making 
Susie comfortable in a matchbox, 
we set to work in the dead of 
night when no inquisitive eyes 
might see our strange experi- 
ments. 

Mary made us pots of steam- 
ing coffee and Mr. Eammer 
paced helpfully back and forth 
uttering unclear mumbles, as I 
toiled the long, wearying hours. 

It did not take long for me 
to gain an empirical understand- 
ing of what I had, by which I 
mean that, like electricity in its 
early days, the mysterious force 



DON'T SHOOT 



47 



could be utilized, made to per- 
form, without complete under- 
standing of its basic nature. 

The night came when I had 
full control of the machine. We 
stood staring at it in awe. We 
had made Susie her normal size 
again. We had enlarged the im- 
age of an old shoe, recklessly 
aimed the projector out toward 
the country and flicked the short 
circuit switch that sent it out in 
space as solid matter. 

After three breathless days, we 
read the puzzled report in the 
newspapers. A shoe eight feet 
long and three feet high had been 
found in the backyard of a sum- 
mer cottage. It was a three-day 
wonder, until somebody advanc- 
ed the theory that it was obvi- 
ously a prop of some kind of 
musical comedy movie. 

T LOOKED at my machine 
with the sense of having cre- 
ated one of the greatest wonders 
of science. My voice was tremb- 
ling with pride as I said to Mary 
and Mr. Eammer, “The things 
that can be done with this inven- 
tion. The incredible things . .” 

“Yes,” said Mr. Eammer, 
gloating. “And it’s mine, all 
mine.” 

“You’ll be the biggest man in 
the movie industry,” I said sol- 
emnly. “You made a good invest- 
ment.” 

Mr. Eammer gave me a 



strange smile. “You are a great 
inventor, my boy, but you have 
a small imagination. Biggest man 
in Hollywood, did you say? The 
only man in Hollywood, you 
mean. Why, do you realize what 
I can do with this machine? I 
can own Hollywood, Television, 
Broadway. And I’ll make a 
list of people I don’t like that 
I’ll get even with. Why, I can 
be Master of the Entertainment 
World . .” 

The blinding realization of 
what I had done flared in my 
numbed brain. I had given a tre- 
mendous scientific weapon to a 
ruthless moron. And there was 
nothing I could do, because he 
had my blueprints locked in his 
safe . 

I stepped forward and with 
full force hit Mr. Eammer on the 
jaw. 

As he sagged, I grabbed him 
and shoved him into the trans- 
mitter. “Look out,” cried Mary. 
“He’s getting up.” 

“No,” he said in a strangled 
voice as he struggled to his knees. 
“No. I’ll . I’ll fix you . .” 

I turned the dials full power, 
hit the directional switch with 
my open palm and closed my 
eyes. 

Mr. Eammer’s voice cut off 
abruptly. When I op>ened my 
eyes, he was gone. 

“Thank heaven,” gasped Mary 
in relief. 



r IMMEDIATELY made com- 
putations and my figures 
showed that Mr. Eammer must 
have been transported to the 



Himalayas. 

That’s the area where the Ab- 
ominable Snowman had been 
sighted. That is why I must speak 
now, regardless of any opinions 
about the state of my sanity. I 
would not want Mr. Eammer shot 
by mistake, as he comes rushing 
toward a party of explorers. 

It’s all right to bring him back 
now. I’ve smashed the machine 
beyond repair and, since Mary 



was Mr. Eammer’s private sec- 
retary, she knew where to get the 
combination of his safe, so we 
were able to destroy my blue- 
prints and technical notebooks. 

I’ve turned the million dollars 
over to Mr. Eammer’s lawyers 
and they are now fighting off the 
creditors, who all think Mr. 
Eammer is deliberately hiding 
from them. 

Whatever you do, please don’t 
take a shot at the Abominable 
Snowman. 

It is Mr. Eammer.

DEATH OF THE SUN (II) 

C ONTEMPLATING the 
activities of and on the 
Sun must have been very 
frustrating to 19th century as- 
tronomers. It was well known 
that everything on Earth, from 
major weather events to the 
growing of a blade of grass, de- 
pended on light and heat from 
the Sun. It was also known that 
the planet Earth intercepted only 
a tiny portion of the light and 
heat generated.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Since the astronomers of the 
19th century knew that every- 
thing on Earth depended on the 
Sun, the question of how the Sun 
kept going — and whether it might 
one day fail — was not merely a 
point of scientific curiosity; it ac- 
quired a very personal aspect. If 
you read through a pile of old 
astronomy books, you can easily 
see how frustrating the whole 
thing was. 

T here was, as explained last 
month, the so-called meteorit- 
ic theory. If meteorites amount- 
ing to one Earth mass per century 
fell into the Sun, their impact 
energy ought to be enough to ac- 
count for the energy generation. 
One Earth mass per century, on 
the other hand, was so little in 
comparison with the enormous 
bulk of the Sun that the increase 
in diameter would be virtually 
negligible. It would take cen- 
turies to detect it even after you 
knew what you were looking for. 

But unfortunately you could 
not expect all the meteorites 
to fall into the Sun in a straight- 
line fall. They would approach 
the Sun in a tight spiral, which 
meant that if the total of one 
Earth mass per century was to 
fall into the Sun, several Earth 
masses should move around it 
close to its surface. And that 
would be enough to be easily vis- 
ible, perhaps even to the naked 



eye. Hence meteorite impact 
could supply only a very small 
amount of the total energy gen- 
eration; it could only be inciden- 
tal to the main process. 

Then there was Helmholtz’s 
contraction theory. You did not 
have to have meteorites fall into 
the Sun; you could get the same 
result by having particles from 
the outer layers drop down to 
lower layers. The overall result 
of this would be a gradual con- 
traction of the Sun, but Helm- 
holtz had shown that this, too, 
would be so little that it would 
take centuries to measure it. 

One drawback was that there 
had to be an end to the process; it 
meant that the Sun would finish 
its career as a star some eight to 
ten million years in the future. 
That did not constitute disproof 
in itself, of course. If the Sun 
was to cease shining eight or ten 
million years in the future, this 
was simply an inevitable fact 
and, in spite of all its inevita- 
bility, it wasn’t something to 
worry about: measured by hu- 
man standards, eight million 
years is a very long time. 

The real drawback was at the 
other hand of the time scale. Cal- 
culating backward by the same 
method, you could tell when the 
Sun had started shining — and 
that was far too short a time. 
The Earth (even before radioac- 
tivity measurements were discov- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



51 




ered) must be older than that 
and a number of courageous zool- 
ogists and paleontologists stated 
boldly that life on Earth should 
be older. 

Having disproved one of the 
two possible explanations them- 
selves, and seeing the other dis- 
puted by the geologists, astrono- 
mers had no way to turn. 

One of them wrote in despera- 
tion; “If we could only tell how 
much of the Sun is liquid, how 
much is solid and how much is 
gaseous, we might be able to find 
an answer!” We now know that 
nothing could be solid or even 
liquid on an 864,000-mile sphere 
with a surface temperature of 
6000° centigrade and a core tem- 
perature of 20 million degrees 
centigrade, but at that time the 
statement was perfectly logical. 

Another astronomer more cour- 
ageously summed up that the 
energy generation of the Sun was 
either due to a combination of 
contraction and meteorites, “or 
else to a process of which we have 
no idea or concept at the present 
time.” 

course, that was the truth. 
” At the moment those lines 
were written, the atom was still 
believed to live up to its name 
(Greek atomos means “indivis- 
ible”) and no one thought that 
there might be energy in the 
atoms, even if they should turn 



out not to be indivisible. Science 
was more or less stuck with 
Helmholtz’s contraction theory 
of 1854, when one could easily 
make the assumption that in the 
past, meteorite falls had supplied 
much more energy than they do 
now, so that a longer period of 
sunshine became available for the 
past, at a time when there were 
no astronomical observers. 

That the atom was not strictly 
indivisible and that energy was 
released by this very fact became 
known during the decade from 
1896-1906. Some ten years after 
that. Sir Arthur Eddington began 
his theoretical work on stellar 
interiors. At almost every point 
of his thinking, lack of knowl- 
edge of atomic behavior inter- 
fered and he finally exclaimed 
that he had intended to delve 
into the interior of the stars and 
ended up in the interior of the 
atom. But this apparently irrele- 
vant detour actually cleared up 
the question. 

We must keep in mind at this 
point that up to the year 1919, 
it was believed that radioactivity 
could not be influenced in any 
way. It had been found in the 
laboratory that certain heavy 
elements — uranium, polonium, 
thorium and radium — did “de- 
cay” into something else, releas- 
ing energy in the process. But 
the decay rate seemed to be given 
and fixed. It remained the same 



f in the coldest cold chamber that 
[ could be produced. It did not 
I change with heat. It remained 

i uninfluenced by electric currents 

I or magnetic fields. 

' In 1919, Ernest Rutherford 
succeeded in smashing a nitrogen 
atom. This opened entirely new 
vistas. One had not been able to 
influence radioactivity by heat or 
i by electric currents. Maybe it 
j merely had not been hot enough 
i or the current had not been pow- 
erful enough. 

Ten years after Rutherford, 

: two young scientists, Robert At- 

kinson and Fritz Houtermans, 

I dared to say for the first time 
; that the nucleus of an atom might 
be attacked if it was hot enough. 
As is now known, the kinetic 
energy of a bit of matter increases 
I with heat. The hotter it is, the 
faster it will move and the en- 
ergy, naturally, depends on the 
speed. 

: When Atkinson and Houter- 

I mans made their statement, it 
' was a comparatively recent item 
of knowledge that under condi- 
1 tions of extreme heat, something 
else will happen to atoms. Nor- 
mally, which in this case means 
any temperature from room tem- 
perature to that of molten steel 
and beyond, each atomic nucleus 
is surrounded by its swirl of elec- 
trons. 

Simplifying things a bit, it was 
assumed that these electrons had 



a kind of cushioning effect. If, 
at “normal” temperatures, one 
atom bumped into another, they 
bounced off their electron shells, 
the nuclei remaining unaffected. 
But as the temperature went up, 
the electrons were gradually 
“stripped” from the nucleus; at 
very high temperatures, the nu- 
cleus of the atoms would be bare. 
At the same time, the speed with 
which they moved was increased 
by the temperature, too. Then, 
in a stellar interior, you had 
“naked nuclei” racing about at 
colossal speeds. 

Under these conditions, it 
seemed possible — even probable 
— that the nuclei might be affect- 
ed by collisions. But that was as 
far as one could go in 1929 — the 
general statement that “thermo- 
nuclear reactions” should be pos- 
sible was all that could be said. 
One could not yet be specific. 

I F you read popular articles on 
atomic energy nowadays, you 
can easily get the impression that 
it all began with the accidental 
discovery of the fission of urani- 
um by Hahn and Strassman. And 
that, after this discovery had 
been verified and the fission bomb 
had been built and used, scien- 
tists began to wonder about the 
fusion of light atoms and finally 
contrived the hydrogen bomb. 

Now this may be a nice and 
simple scheme for explaining 



52

53 



things to an outsider, but it is 
not correct historically. Even be- 
fore it was known that heavy 
elements like uranium could go 
into fission, scientists were talk- 
ing about generating atomic en- 
ergy by fusion. Not that they 
talked about doing it themselves; 
they talked about it as something 
that probably went on inside the 
stars. 

One likely reaction seemed to 
be the fusion of a lithium nucleus 
and a hydrogen nucleus into a he- 
lium nucleus. But that could not 
be what happened in our sun. It 
would be far too fast under the 
circumstances actually prevail- 
ing. It would result in one big 
flash and that couldn’t be it. As 
George Gamow wrote then, “We 
know, therefore, that our sun 
cannot contain any appreciable 
amount of lithium in its interior, 
just as we know that a slowly 
burning barrel surely cannot con- 
tain any gunpowder.” 

What really keeps the Sun 
going was figured out for the first 
time under somewhat unusual 
circumstances. In 1938, a Confer- 
ence on Theoretical Physics took 
place in Washington, D. C., and 
one of the participants was Dr. 
Hans Bethe of Cornell. As he was 
riding home on the train, he de- 
cided that one should be able to 
find the proper reaction by check- 
ing through a number of- possi- 
bilities. It seemed likely that the 



energy output of different nucle- 
ar reactions should differ greatly 
in magnitude so that, if one could 
find a nuclear reaction which tal- 
lied with the actual energy re- 
lease of the Sun, one could be 
fairly sure of having the right 
one. 

Professor Bethe started check- 
ing through a number of likely 
nuclear reactions. Before his train 
pulled in, he found one which 
gave the right result! 

Strangely enough, Dr. Bethe’s 
colleague, Karl von Weizsacker in 
Germany, arrived at the same re- 
sult (I don’t know under what 
external circumstances) at the 
same time. The cycle of reactions 
is usually called the “Solar Phoe- 
nix Reaction” because the carbon 
atom which is involved reappears 
unchanged at the end, so that it 
acts more like a nuclear catalyst. 

Naturally, in such a self-con- 
suming cauldron as the Sun, with 
the enormous size and the tem- 
peratures involved, more than 
one nuclear reaction will go on. 
A little over 10 per cent of the 
total energy generation is thought 
to be due to what has been call- 
ed Critchfield’s H-H process 
which assumed a head-on colli- 
sion of two protons (hydrogen 
nuclei) with subsequent ejection 
of a positron. A third reaction 
that probably happens is this 
one. 

As has been intimated, the

various thermonuclear reactions 
depend on temperature. Obvious- 
ly they cannot be the same for 
every star; some stars are hotter 
than our sun and some are cooler. 
In a star like Sirius — hotter but 
otherwise of the same general 
type — there can be very little of 
the H-H process, while this proc- 
ess might be the sole or at least 
main energy source in a fainter 
star. 

Knowing now that thermo- 
nuclear reactions — fusions of 
light atoms — provide the energy 



of the stars and knowing, too, at 
what temperature the various re- 
actions can take place, we can 
search an entirely new picture of 
stellar evolution. 

You remember what they 
thought of stellar evolution be- 
fore atomic energy was known. 
In the beginning, they put an 
uncondensed star — the term now 
in use for this is “proto-star” — 
which by way of contraction was 
finally hot enough to shine with 
visible light. As contraction prog- 
ressed, the star went through a

white phase (Sirius as an ex- 
ample) then through a yellow 
phase (our sun as an example) 
and finally, when most of the 
energy had been radiated away 
but contraction was virtually fin- 
ished, the red phase. The black 
and invisible phase was to be 
the end. 

The modern concept still be- 
gins with the proto-star, a fan- 
tastically tenuous accumulation 
of gas molecules with some cos- 
mic dust mixed in; that dust later 
evaporates into gases when the 
temperature rises. And early in 
the career of a star, old Helm- 
holtz’s contraction theory actu- 
ally applies to the full. 

The heat generated is produced 
by contraction and, as the proc- 
ess goes on, the star grows hotter, 
producing more heat by contrac- 

1 than is radiated away from 
irs steadily shrinking surface. 
Therefore the temperature in the 
core approaches a point, after a 
while, where thermonuclear re- 
actions will start. At that time 
the star is still enormous as far 
as volume occupied is concerned, 
but is still very tenuous and not 
very luminous. It is a so-called 
Red Giant. 

RAKING a specific Red Giant, 

epsilon Aurigae, it can be 
demonstrated that the tempera- 
ture of its core is not yet high 
enough to keep a reaction of the 



f 

type of the Solar Phoenix cycle jP 
going. The reaction must be be-| 
tween deuterium and hydrogen! 
(or heavy hydrogen and ordinary I 
hydrogen), resulting in helium I 
and energy. I 

It is an interesting point that I 
the star’s mass acts as a kind of 
safety valve. Supposing the nu- 
clear reaction was too violent, 
the heat produced would simply 
expand the whole star. That way, 
the radiating surface increases 
and, in an extreme case, the core 
may simply grow too cool to sus- 
tain the nuclear reaction. Then 
the star would rely on contrac- 
tion until the core grows hot 
enough again. 

Astronomers know a number 
of stars which bear the designa- 
tion of “pulsating stars.’’ They 
expand and shrink at regular in- 
tervals. It is thought— but, as 
far as I know, not yet completely 
proved — that these pulsating 
stars are forever on the border- 
line between Helmholtz’s contrac- 
tion and thermonuclear energy 
generation. 

Every time they have con- 
tracted enough to heat their interi- 
or to nuclear activity, the nuclear 
activity grows violent enough to 
expand the whole star and quench 
the nuclear fire. Just what con- 
ditions are necessary to put a 
star into this dilemma is not yet 
known. Obviously the majority 
of the stars somehow escaped this 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



difficulty and went on to higher 
core temperatures. Some known 
Red Giants must rely on the lith- 
ium-hydrogen reaction mentioned 
earlier. Still hotter ones rely on 
a reaction converting boron and 
hydrogen into helium. 

You must have noticed that 
these thermonuclear reactions 
which keep the stars going always 
end up with helium. Since the 
reactions must start at the very 
core, where it is hottest, one can 
assume that helium will accumu- 
late at the core, finally to the vir- 
tual exclusion of all other atoms. 
Logically then, as a star grows 
older, the reaction no longer takes 
place at the precise core. That is 
taken up by the atomic slag heap 
of helium atoms. 

We have to picture, in that case, 
a core of no longer reacting heli- 
um, of uniform and very high 
temperature. The “surface” of 
this central helium sphere is 
where the thermonuclear reac- 
tions take place. The area above 
the reacting spherical shell is still 
too cool to let reactions take 
place. As this reacting sphere 
grows, the rate of conversion of 
other elements into helium grows, 
too. Hence as a star uses up its 
fuel faster, the less is left of it. 

Percentagewise, Sirius “burns 
up” more hydrogen atoms than 
the Sun every second. It is, from 
this point of view, an “older star” 
while our sun is still so young 



that its end lies not several mil- 
lion but several billion years in 
the future. 

A t some time near the end of 
the star’s life, something hap- 
pens. Possibly the generating shell 
comes so close to the surface that 
all the nuclear fuel above it is 
consumed in a flash. After that, 
the star collapses to form one of 
the super-dense White Dwarfs. 
Since a White Dwarf has abso- 
lutely no method of energy gen- 
eration left — it has used up all 
the elements which could be nu- 
cuear fuel and cannot contract 
any more — it must be considered 
“dead.” 

As a side-issue, I would like to 
mention a recent idea about the 
Blue-white Giants. Fred Hoyle 
in England has made much of the 
idea of stars passing through 
clouds of cosmic dust and acquir- 
ing large amounts of matter by 
“tunneling” through such a dust 
cloud, a variation of the old met- 
eoric impact theory. Such an 
event must be rare, but astrophy- 
sicists feel that the rare Blue- 
white Giants fit this assumption. 
They are, then, not stars in a 
certain (and somewhat mysteri- 
ous) state of stellar evolution, 
but “rejuvenated stars” which 
might have held any place in 
stellar evolution before they en- 
tered a cloud. 

How about the “black stars,”

though, which were so much dis- 
cussed a century ago? The over- 
whelming probability is that there 
aren’t any. As long as there is 
any method of energy generation 
left, the star will utilize it. And 
when it has finally reached the 
ultimate stage of the White 
Dwarf, it combines an enormous 
heat content with a very small 
radiating surface, since a col- 
lapsed star probably has about 
the same diameter as the Earth. 

Figuring things very carefully, 
a White Dwarf should need some 
8,000 million years to radiate 
away its energy and turn dark. 

But the Universe is probably 
only half as old as that figure — 
so that even the very first White 
Dwarf ever to form must still be 
luminous ! 

The question “When will the 
Sun die?” is, in terms of that 
fact, just about as academic as 
any could be. If it’s keeping you 
up nights, you have about 4,000 
million years — minimum ! — to 
stay awake worrying, so let’s put 
out the light and go to sleep, 
shall we? 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Just what does “terminal ve- 
locity mean? I had always 
thought that a body falls faster 
and faster the longer it falls. But 
from something I’ve just read, it 
seems that this is not always 



true. What is the answer? 

Eva Sidera 

7221 Sunset Boulevard 

Hollywood, Calif. 

Looking at falling bodies 
from the point of view of a man 
(or woman) on the ground, it 
is almost never true that they 
fall the faster the longer they 
fall. The reason is air resist- I 
ance. Let’s take a specific ex- [ 
ample. An airplane sheds a ^ 
wingtip fuel tank at a height of 
three miles. According to one 
of the so-called Galilean equa- 
tions, the tank’s impact velocity 
on the ground will be v = gt, 
which simply means that at 
the end of every elapsed sec- 
ond, it falls 32 feet per sec. 
faster than at the beginning of ’ 
the same second. 

If the empty fuel tank had 
been jettisoned by a rocket 
three miles above the Moon, 
the formula would actually hold 
true. Of course you’d have to • 
use the “g” that applies to the 
Moon, not the one that applies 
to the Earth. 

But on Earth, we have air \ 
resistance. As the tank begins 
to fall faster and faster, air re- 
sistance grows stronger and 
stronger. The important factor , 
is that air resistance grows i 
much faster. Soon, therefore, 
the point is reached where air 
resistance prevents any addi- 
tional increase in falling speed. 




( From then on, the body will 
fall with a virtually uniform 
velocity, which is the “terminal 
velocity.” For a fall from a very 
great height, like a long-range 
missile falling out of the strato- 
sphere, terminal velocity will 
never he established; the im- 
pact will take place before a 
balance could he achieved. 

As for figures; the terminal 
velocity of such an empty wing- 
tip tank might he around 100 
mph. If the tank were jettison- 
ed full, with all the fuel in it, 
the terminal velocity would he 
somewhere around 300 mph 
and that of a bomb, with thick 
steel casing and packed w ith 
high -explosive, around 900 
mph. It is for this reason that 
there have been bombs with a 
rocket charge to push them 
downward faster. On the other 
hand, if you wish to decrease 
terminal velocity, just add 
something with lots of air-re- 
sistance — a parachute, for in- 
stance. 

In many stories — in fact, al- 
most all of them — while the rock- 
et is under power, there is an in- 
creased gravity. I know that while 
rising from some gravitational 
source, such as a planet, gravity 
and weight would seem to in- 
crease. Beyond a certain distance 
from a gravity source, gravity is 
said to be almost nil. In the books, 



while the rocket is in free fall, 
there is no weight. Okay. But 
when the rocket is moving, there 
is weight. And as soon as the pow- 
er cuts out, there is no weight, 
even though the rocket maintains 
the same velocity. 

Will you please explain why 
such artificial weight occurs un- 
der power? I would very much 
like to know. 

Buddie Akers 

(no address given) 

I have answered a very sim- 
ilar question once before, but 
a repeat might do some good, 
for I know that many people 
are confused on these points. 
The confusion, it appears to 
me, is based on two misunder- 
standings. Misunderstanding 
No. One is that the nearness 
of a large and heavy body (a 
“gravitational source,” to para- 
phrase Mr. Akers) must pro- 
duce “weight” no matter what 
the circumstances. Misunder- 
standing No. Two is apparently 
that only a “gravitational 
source” can produce “weight.” 
In reality, things are quite dif- 
ferent. 

A gravitational field will in- 
fluence the movement of a near- 
by body, deflect it from its 
course or make it fall. But it 
will not produce the feeling of 
“weight.” That sensation is 
caused hy resisting the pull of 
the gravitational field.

As I am sitting here typing, 
I am supported by my chair, 
the chair is supported by the 
floor and the floor by the house 
and ultimately by the ground. 
This support prevents me from 
following the gravitational pull 
and this fact causes the sensa- 
tion of weight. If I could fall 
freely into a deep well under 
my chair, I might come to a 
bad end, but I would nol feel 
weight while the falling lasts. 

The increase of weight in a 
rising rocket is due to two fac- 
tors: as long as it stands on the 
pound, things are the same as 
if it were a house. When it be- 
gins to rise, the acceleration 
even goes the other way. The 
pull of the Earth is not just 
passively resisted hut overcome 
by brute force into faster and 
faster movement against the 
pull of gravity. 

This brings us to Misunder- 
standing No. Two. If a body 
like a spaceship is freely float- 
ing in space, leisurely following 
some weak gravitational pull 
from somewhere, there is “zero 
g” in the cabin — complete ab- 
sence of weight, no resistance 
to movement. But when the 
rocket motors start up, accel- 
erating the ship, they enforce a 
new movement. The force ap- 
plied meets with resistance (the 
inertia of the things inside the 
ship and al^o that of the ship 



itself) and hence weight ap- 
pears. 

When the rocket motors are 
shut off again, the ship will 
move with a different course, 
but then nothing will counter- 
act the gravitational forces 
which may be playing on the 
ship and nothing will disturb 
inertia — again no weight. 

Another point that enters 
here is that our body has no 
organ for detecting its own ve- 
locity. It cannot “feel” velocity; 
It can only note changes in ve- 
locity, acceleration or decelera- 
tion. 

In short, the feeling of 
weight can be caused either by 
accelerating where inertia re- 
sists the change, or else by re- 
sisting the pull of a gravitational 
field. 

What would a man’s weight be 
at the exact center of the Earth? 
According to one formula, the 
answer should be infinity; how- 
ever, since the forces are theoret- 
ically equal on each side, the 
weight should be zero. What is 
your opinion? 

Henry Oden 
2317 Myrtle Street 
Alexandria, La. 

This is not a matter of opin- 
ion. The second answer is cor- 
rect. In the precise center of the 
Earth (or any other planet, for 
that matter) equal masses

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION

would act from every direction 
on the body in the center. Since 
they would all cancel out, the 
result would obviously have to 
be zero. The formula you have 
in mind applies only to attrac- 
tion from one direction. 

I just reread your column on 
Mars in the July 1954 GALAXY 
and wonder whether there are 
astronomical works speciScally 
about that planet. I have a read- 
ing knowledge of French, in case 
this should help. 

Chester P. Talley 
16-36, 62nd Street 
Maspeth, L.I. N.Y. 

A reading knowledge of 
French certainly helps in this 
case because the most recent 
comprehensive book on Mars 
happens to be in that language. 
Its title is Physique de la Pla- 
nete Mars, written by Gerard de 
Vaucouleurs. A shorter book 
by the same author exists in 
English under the title The 
Planet Mars. Both were pub- 
lished in 1950. 



Most recent in this country 
is The Red and Green Planet 
by Hubertus Strughold, M.D., 
Ph.D. (1954), unless a sched- 
uled book on Mars by Dr. Rob- 
ert S. Richardson has been 
published by the time this col- 
umn appears in print. Of in- 
terest are Observations of Mars 
and Its Canals (1941) and 



Observations of the Planet 
Mars (1936), both by Harold 
B. Webb. 

And in case you have a read- 
ing knowled^ ' of German, too, 

I recommend for a quick sur- 
vey Mars, seine Raetsel und 
seine Geschichte by Robert 
Henseling (1925). 

What is known about the phys- 
iological effects of high accelera- 
tion? In particular, how much 
can the body stand momentarily 
and continuously? 

Millard H. Perstein 
1447 Willard Street 
San Francisco 17, Calif. 

Many acceleration tests have 
been carried out by means of 
centrifuges and it is now known 
that an acceleration of 3 g for 
ten minutes can be borne with- 
out aftereffects. (That would 
have been more than enough 
to produce escape velocity, if 
it had been a straight line ac- 
celeration. ) 

As for higher g forces: one 
volunteer endured 17 g for one 
minute without detectable harm 
and others have endured as 
much as 30 g for a number of 
seconds. 

As regards the acceleration 
human beings can stand, espe- 
cially when lying almost flat 
on their backs, it is no deter- 
rent to space travel.

The Lifeboat 

Mutiny 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



No, sir, they do not build 
boats like this any longer 
. and this is the reason! 



^(Jt ■ lELL me the truth. Did 
I you ever see sweeter en- 
J. gines?” Joe, the Inter- 
stellar Junkman asked. “And look 
at those servos!” 

“Hmm,” Gregor said judici- 
ously. 

That hull,” Joe said softly. 
“I bet it’s five hundred years old, 
and not a spot of corrosion on 
it.” He patted the burnished side 
of the boat affectionately. What 
luck, the pat seemed to say, that 
this paragon among vessels 
should be here just when AAA 
Ace needs a lifeboat.

“She certainly does seem rather 
nice,” Arnold said, with the 
studied air of a man who has 
fallen in love and is trying hard 
not to show it. “What do you 
think, Dick?” 

Richard Gregor didn’t answer. 
The boat was handsome, and she 
looked perfect for ocean survey 
work on Trident. But you had 
to be careful about Joe’s merch- 
andise. 

“They just don’t build ’em this 
way any more,” Joe sighed. 

Look at the propulsion unit. 
Couldn’t dent it with a trip-

hammer. Note the capacity of 
jhe cooling system. Examine—” 
“It looks good,” Gregor said 
slowly. The AAA Ace Inter- 
olanetary Decontamination Ser- 
vice had dealt with Joe in the 
past, and had learned caution. 
Not that Joe was dishonest; far 
from it. The flotsam he collected 
from anywhere in the inhabited 
Universe worked. But the ancient 
machines often had their own 
ideas of how a job should be 
done. They tended to grow peev- 
ish when forced into another 
routine. 



“I don’t care if it’s beautiful, 
fast, durable, or even comfort- 
able,” Gregor said defiantly. “I 
just want to be absolutely sure 
it’s safe.” 

Joe nodded. “That’s the im- 
portant thing, of course. Step 
inside.” 

T hey entered the cabin of the 
boat. Joe stepped up to the 
instrument panel, smiled mys- 
teriously, and pressed a button. 

Immediately Gregor heard a 
voice which seemed to originate 
in his head, saying, “I am Life- 
boat 32 4- A. My purpose — ” 
“Telepathy?” Gregor inter- 
rupted. 

“Direct sense recording,” Joe 
said, smiling proudly. “No 
language barriers that way. I 
told you, they just don’t build 
’em this way any more.” 



“I am Lifeboat 324-A,” the 
boat esped again. “My primary 
purpose is to preserve those with- 
in me from peril, and to main- 
tain them in good health. At 
present, I am only partially 
activated.” 

“Could anything be safer?” 
Joe cried. “This is no senseless 
hunk of metal. This boat will 
look after you. This boat cares!” 
Gregor was impressed, even 
though the idea of an emotional 
boat was somehow distasteful. 
But then, paternalistic gadgets 
had always irritated him. 

Arnold had no such feelings. 
“We’ll take it!” 

“You won’t be sorry,” Joe said, 
in the frank and open tones that 
had helped make him a mil- 
lionaire several times over. 
Gregor hoped not. 

The next day. Lifeboat 324-A 
was loaded aboard their space- 
ship and they blasted off for 
Trident. 

This planet, in the heart of the 
East Star Valley, had recently 
been bought by a real-estate 
speculator. He’d found her nearly 
perfect for colonization. Trident 
was the size of Mars, but with a 
far better climate. There was no 
indigenous native population to 
contend with, no poisonous 
plants, no germ-borne diseases. 
And, unlike so many worlds. Tri- 
dent had no predatory animals. 
Indeed, she had no animals at all. 



THE LIFEBOAT MUTINY 



63 



Apart from one small island and 
a polar cap, the entire planet was 
covered with water. 

There was no real shortage of 
land; you could wade across 
several of Trident’s seas. The 
land just wasn’t heaped high 
enough. 

AAA Ace had been commis- 
sioned to correct this minor 
flaw. 

After landing on Trident’s 
single island, they launched the 
boat. The rest of the day was 
spent checking and loading the 
special survey equipment on 
board. Early the next morning, 
Gregor prepared sandwiches and 
filled a canteen with water. They 
were ready to begin work. 

As soon as the mooring lines 
were cast off, Gregor joined 
Arnold in the cabin. With a small 
flourish, Arnold pressed the first 
button. 

“I am Lifeboat 324-A,” the 
boat esped. “My primary pur- 
pose is to preserve those within 
me from peril, and to maintain 
them in good health. At present, 

I am only partially activated. 
For full activation, press button 
two.’’ 

Gregor pressed the second 
button. 

There was a muffled buzzing 
deep in the bowels of the boat. 
Nothing else happened. 

“That’s odd,’’ Gregor said. He 
pressed the button again. The 



muffled buzz was repeated. 

“Sounds like a short circuit,' 
Arnold said. 

Glancing out the forward port- 
hole, Gregor saw the shoreline of 
the island slowly drifting away. 
He felt a touch of panic. There 
was so much water here, and so 
little land. To make matters 
worse, nothing on the instrument 
panel resembled a wheel or tiller, 
nothing looked like a throttle or 
clutch. How did you operate a 
partially activated lifeboat? 

“She must control telepath- 
ically,” Gregor said hopefully. In 
a stern voice he said, “Go ahead 
slowly.” 

The little boat forged ahead. 
“Now right a little.” 

The boat responded perfectly 
to Gregor’s clear, although \m- 
nautical command. The partners 
exchanged smiles. 

“Straighten out,” Gregor said, 
“and full speed ahead!” 

The lifeboat charged forward 
into the shining, empty sea. 

A RNOLD disappeared into the 
bilge with a flashlight and a 
circuit tester. The surveying was 
easy enough for Gregor to handle 
alone. The machines did all the 
work, tracing the major faults in 
the ocean bottom, locating the 
most promising volcanoes, run- 
ning the flow and buildup charts. 
When the survey was complete, 
the next stage would be turned

r 

I over to a subbcontractor. He 
“ would wire the volcanoes, seed 
the faults, retreat to a safe dis- 
tance and touch the whole thing 
off. 

Then Trident would be, for a 
while, a spectacularly noisy place. 
And when things had quieted 
down, there would be enough dry 
land to satisfy even a real-estate 
speculator. 

By mid-afternoon Gregor felt 
that they had done enough sur- 
veying for one day. He and Ar- 
nold ate their sandwiches and 
drank from the canteen. Later 
they took a short swim in Tri- 
dent’s clear green water. 

“I think I’ve found the 
trouble,” Arnold said. “The leads 
to the primary activators have 
been removed. And the power 
cable’s been cut.” 

“Why would anyone do that?” 
Gregor asked. 

Arnold shrugged. “Might have 
been part of the decommission- 
ing. I’ll have it right in a little 
while.” 

He crawled back into the bilge. 
Gregor turned in the direction of 
the island, steering telepathically 
and watching the green water 
foam merrily past the bow. At 
moments like this, contrary to all 
his previous experience, the Uni- 
verse seemed a fine and friendly 
place. 

In half an hour Arnold 
emerged, grease - stained but

triumphant. “Try that button 
now,” he said. 

“But we’re almost back.” 

“So what? Might as well have 
this thing working right.” 

Gregor nodded, and pushed 
the second button. 

They could hear the faint 
click-click of circuits opening. 
Half a dozen small engines 
purred into life. A light flashed 
red, then winked off as the gen- 
erators took up the load. 

“That’s more like it,” Arnold 
said. 

1 AM Lifeboat 324-A,” the 
boat stated telepathically. “I 
am now fully activated, and able 
to protect my occupants from 
danger. Have faith in me. My 
action-response tapes, both psy- 
chological and physical, have 
been prepared by the best scien- 
tific minds in all Drome.” 

“Gives you quite a feeling of 
confidence, doesn’t it?” Arnold 
said. 

“I suppose so,” Gregor said. 
“But. where is Drome?” 

“Gentlemen,” the lifeboat con- 
tinued, “try to think of me, not 
as an unfeeling mechanism, but 
as your friend and comrade-in- 
arms. I understand how you feel. 
You have seen your ship go 
down, cruelly riddled by the im- 
placable H’gen. You have—” 
“What ship?” Gregor asked. 
“What’s it talking about?” 

65 



64 



“ — crawled aboard me, dazed, 
gasping from the poisonous 
fumes of water; half-dead — ” 

“You mean that swim we 
took?” Arnold asked. “You’ve 
got it all wrong. We were just 
surveying — ” 

“ — shocked, wounded, morale 
low,” the lifeboat finished. “You 
are a little frightened, perhaps,” 
it said in a softer mental tone. 
“And well you might be, sepa- 
rated from the Drome fleet and 
adrift upon an inclement alien 
planet. A little fear is nothing to 
be ashamed of, gentlemen. But 
this is war, and war is a cruel 
business. We have no alternative 
but to drive the barbaric H’gen 
back across space.” 

“There must be a reasonable 
explanation for all this,” Gregor 
said. “Probably an old television 
script got mixed up in its response 
bank.” 

“We’d better give it a com- 
plete overhaul,” Arnold said. 
“Can’t listen to that stuff all 
day.” 

They were approaching the 
island. The lifeboat was still bab- 
bling about home and hearth, 
evasive action, tactical maneu- 
vers, and the need for calm in 
emergencies like this. Suddenly it 
slowed. 

“What’s the matter?” Gregor 
asked. 

“I am scanning the island,” the 
lifeboat answered. 



/GREGOR and Arnold glanced 
at each other. “Better humor 
it,” Arnold whispered. To the 
lifeboat he said, “That island’s 
okay. We checked it personally.” 
“Perhaps you did,” the lifeboat 
answered. “But in modern, light- 
ning-quick warfare. Drome 
senses cannot be trusted. They 
are too limited, too prone to in- 
terpret what they wish. Elec- 
tronic senses, on the other hand, 
are emotionless, eternally vigi- 
lant, and infallible within their 
limits.” 

“But there isn’t anything 
there!” Gregor shouted. 

“I perceive a foreign space- 
ship,” the lifeboat answered. “It 
has no Drome markings.” 

“It hasn’t any enemy markings, 
either,” Arnold answered con- 
fidently, since he had painted the 
ancient hull himself. 

“No, it hasn’t. But in war, we 
must assume that what is not 
ours is the enemy’s. I understand 
your desire to set foot on land 
again. But I take into account 
factors that a Drome, motivated 
by his emotions, would overlook. 
Consider the apparent emptiness 
of this strategic bit of land; the 
unmarked spaceship put tempt- 
ingly out for bait; the fact that 
our fleet is no longer in this vicin- 
ity; the—” 

“All right, that’s enough,” Gre- 
gor was sick of arguing with a 
verbose and egoistic machine. 



66

“Go directly to that island. That’s 
an order.” 

“I cannot obey that order,” the 
boat said. “You are unbalanced 
from your harrowing escape from 
death — ” 

Arnold reached for the cutout 
switch, and withdrew his hand 
with a howl of pain. 

“Come to your senses, gentle- 
men,” the boat said sternly. “Only 
the decommissioning officer is 
empowered to turn me off. For 
your own safety, I must warn 
you not to touch any of my con- 
trols. You are mentally unbal- 
anced. Later, when our position is 
safer, I will administer to you. 
Now my full energies must be 
devoted toward detection and 
escape from the enemy.” 

The boat picked up speed and 
moved away from the island in 
an intricate evasive pattern. 

“Where are we going?” Gregor 
asked. 

“To rejoin the Drome fleet!” 
the lifeboat cried so confidently 
that the partners stared nervously 
over the vast, deserted waters of 
Trident. 

“As soon as I can find it, that 
is,” the lifeboat amended. 

TT was late at night. Gregor and 
Arnold sat in a corner of the 
cabin, hungrily sharing their last 
sandwich. The lifeboat was still 
rushing madly over the waves, its 
every electronic sense alert, 



searching for a fleet that had ex- 
isted five hundred years ago, upon 
an entirely different planet. 

“Did you ever hear of these 
Dromes?” Gregor asked. 

Arnold searched through his 
vast store of minutiae. “They 
were non-human, lizard-evolved 
creatures,” he said. “Lived on the 
sixth planet of some little system 
near Capella. The race died out 
over a century ago.” 

“And the H’gen?” 

“Also lizards. Same story.” 
Arnold found a crumb and 
popped it into his mouth. “It 
wasn’t a very important war. All 
the combatants are gone. Except 
this lifeboat, apparently.” 

And us,” Gregor reminded 
him. “We’ve been drafted as 
Drome soldiery.” He sighed 
wearily. “Do you think we can 
reason with this tub?” 

Arnold shook his head. “I don’t 
see how. As far as this boat is 
concerned, the war is still on. It 
can only interpret data in terms 
of that premise.” 

“It’s probably listening in on 
us now,” Gregor said. 

“I don’t think so. It’s not really 
a mind-reader. Its perception cen- 
ters are geared only to thoughts 
aimed specifically at it.” 

“Yes siree,” Gregor said bitter- 
ly, “they just don’t build ’em 
this way any more.” He wished he 
could get his hands on Joe, the 
Interstellar Junkman.

“It’s actually a very interest- 
ing situation,” Arnold said. “I 
may do an article on it for Popu- 
lar Cybernetics. Here is a ma- 
chine with nearly infallible ap- 
paratus for the perception of 
external stimuli. The percepts it 
receives are translated logically 
into action. The only trouble is, 
the logic is based upon no longer 
existent conditions. Therefore, 
you could say that the machine 
is the victim of a systematized 
delusional system.” 

Gregor yawned. “You mean the 
lifeboat is just plain nuts,” he 
said bluntly. 

“Nutty as a fruitcake. I be- 
lieve paranoia would be the prop- 
er designation. But it’ll end pretty 
soon.” 

“Why?” Gregor asked. 

“It’s obvious,” Arnold said. 
“The boat’s prime directive is to 
keep us alive. So he has to feed 
us. Our sandwiches are gone, and 
the only other food is on the 
island. I figure he’ll have to take 
a chance and go back.” 

I N a few moments they could 
feel the lifeboat swinging, 
changing direction. It esped, “At 
present I am unable to locate the 
Drome fleet. Therefore, I am 
turning back to scan the island 
once again. Fortunately, there are 
no enemy in this immediate area. 
Now I can devote myself to your 
care with all the power of my

full attention.” 

“You see?” Arnold said, nudg- 
ing Gregor. “Just as I said. Now 
we’ll reinforce the concept.” He 
said to the lifeboat, “About time 
you got around to us. We’re hun- 
gry-” 

“Yeah, feed us,” Gregor de- 
manded. 

“Of course,” the lifeboat said. 
A tray slid out of the wall. It 
was heaped high with something 
that looked like clay, but smelled 
like machine oil. 

“What’s that supposed to be?” 
Gregor asked. 

“That is geezel,” the lifeboat 
said. “It is the staple diet of the 
Drome peoples. I can prepare it 
in sixteen different ways.” 

Gregor cautiously sampled it. 
It tasted just like clay coated with 
machine oil. 

“We can’t eat that!” he ob- 
jected. 

“Of course you can,” the boat 
said soothingly. “An adult Drome 
consumes five point three pounds 
of geezel a day, and cries for 
more.” 

The tray slid toward them. 
They backed away from it. 

“Now listen,” Arnold told the 
boat. “We are not Dromes. We’re 
humans, an entirely different 
species. The war you think you’re 
fighting ended five hundred years 
ago. We can’t eat geezel. Our 
food is on that island.” 

“Try to grasp the situation. 



69 



Your delusion is a common one 
among fighting men. It is an es- 
cape fantasy, a retreat from an 
intolerable situation. Gentlemen, 
I beg you, face reality!” 

“You face reality!” Gregor 
screamed. “Or I’ll have you dis- 
mantled bolt by bolt.” 

“Threats do not disturb me,” 
the lifeboat esped serenely. “I 
know what you’ve been through. 
Possibly you have suffered some 
brain damage from your exposure 
to poisonous water.” 

“Poison?” Gregor gulped. 

“By Drome standards,” Arnold 
reminded him. 

“If absolutely necessary,” the 
lifeboat continued, “I am also 
equipped to perform physical 
brain therapy. It is a drastic 
measure, but there can be no 
coddling in time of war.” A panel 
slid open, and the partners 
glimpsed shining surgical edges. 

“We’re feeling better already,” 
Gregor said hastily. “Fine looking 
batch of geezel, eh, Arnold?” 
“Delicious,” Arnold said, winc- 
ing. 

“I won a nationwide contest 
in geezel preparation,” the life- 
boat esped, with pardonable pride. 
“Nothing is too good for our boys 
in uniform. Do try a little.” 
Gregor lifted a handful, smack- 
ed his lips, and set it down on 
the floor. “Wonderful,” he said, 
hoping that the boat’s internal 
scanners weren’t as efficient as 



the external ones seemed to be. 

Apparently they were not 
“Good,” the lifeboat said. “I ar 
moving toward the island no 
And, I promise you, in a li' 
while you will be more c,, 
fortable.” 

“Why?” Arnold asked. 

“The temperature here is un- 
bearably hot. It’s amazing that 
you haven’t ^one into coma. Any 
other Drome would have. Try to 
bear it a little longer. Soon, I’ll 
have it down to the Drome norm 
of twenty degrees below zero. 
And now, to assist your morale, 
I will play our national Anthem.” 

A hideous rhythmic screeching 
filled the air. Waves slapped 
against the sides of the hurrying 
lifeboat. In a few moments, the 
air was perceptibly cooler. 

G regor dosed his eyes wear- 
ily, trying to ignore the chill 
that was spreading through his 
limbs. He was becoming sleepy. 
Just his luck, he thought, to be 
frozen to death inside an insane 
lifeboat. It was what came of buy- 
ing paternalistic gadgets, high- 
strung, humanistic calculators, 
over-sensitive, emotional ma- 
chines. 

Dreamily he wondered where 
it was all leading to. He pictured 
a gigantic machine hospital. Two 
robot doctors were wheeling a 
lawnmower down a long white 
corridor. The Chief Robot Doc- 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tor was saying, “What’s wrong 
with this lad?” And the assistant 
answered, “Completely out of his 
mind. Thinks he’s a helicopter.” 
“Aha!” the Chief said knowingly. 
“Flying fantasies! Pity. Nice 
looking chap.” The assistant 
nodded. “Overwork did it. Broke 
his heart on crab grass.” The 
lawnmower stirred. “Now I’m an 
eggbeater!” he giggled. 

“Wake up,” Arnold said, shak- 
ing Gregor, his teeth chattering. 
“We have to do something.” 

“Ask him to turn on the heat,” 
Gregor said groggily. 

“Not a chance. Dromes live at 
twenty belqw. We are Dromes. 
Twenty below for us, and no 
back talk.” 

Frost was piled deep on the 
coolant tubes that traversed the 
boat. The walls had begun to 
turn white, and the portholes 
were frosted over. 

“I’ve got an idea,” Arnold said 
cautiously. He glanced at the 
control board, then whispered 
quickly in Gregor’s ear. 

“We’ll try it,” Gregor said. 
They stood up. Gregor picked up 
the canteen and walked stiffly to 
the far side of the cabin. 

“What are you doing?” the 
lifeboat asked sharply. 

“Going to get a little exercise,” 
Gregor said. “Drome soldiers 
must stay fit, you know.” 

“That’s true,” the lifeboat said 
dubiously. 



Gregor threw the canteen to 
Arnold. 

Arnold chuckled synthetically 
and threw the canteen back to 
Gregor. 

“Be careful with that recep- 
tacle,” the lifeboat warned. “It 
is filled with a deadly poison.” 

“We’ll be careful,” Gregor said. 
“We’re taking it back to head- 
quarters.” He threw the canteen 
to Arnold. 

“Headquarters may spray it on 
the H’gen,” Arnold said, throw- 
ing the canteen back. 

“Really?” the lifeboat asked. 
“That’s interesting. A new ap- 
plication of — ” 

Suddenly Gregor swung the 
canteen against the coolant tube. 
The tube broke and liquid poured 
over the floor. 

“'Bad shot, old man,” Arnold 
said. 

“How careless of me,” Gregor 
cried. 

“I should have taken precau- 
tions against internal accidents,” 
the lifeboat esped gloomily. “It 
won’t happen again. But the sit- 
uation is very serious. I cannot 
repair the tube myself. I am un- 
able to properly cool the boat.” 

“If you just drop us on the 
island — ” Arnold began. 

“Impossible!” the lifeboat said. 
“My first duty is to preserve 
your lives, and you could not 
live long in the climate of this 
planet. But I am going to take 



THE LIFEBOAT MUTINY 



71 



the necessary measures to ensure 
your safety.” 

“What are you going to do?” 
Gregor asked, with a sinking feel- 
ing in the pit of his stomach. 

“There is no time to waste. I 
will scan the island once more. 
If our Drome forces are not pres- 
ent, we will go to the one place on 
this planet that can sustain 
Drome life.” 

“What place?” 

“The southern polar cap,” the 
lifeboat said. “The climate there 
is almost ideal — thirty below zero, 
I estimate.” 

The engines roared. Apologet- 
ically the boat added. “And, of 
course, I must guard against any 
further internal acidents.” 

As the lifeboat charged for- 
ward they could hear the click of 
the locks, sealing their cabin. 

T HINK!” Arnold said. 

“I am thinking,” Gregor 
answered. “But nothing’s coming 
out.” 

“We must get off when he 
reaches the island. It’ll be our 
last chance.” 

“You don’t think we could 
jump overboard?” Gregor asked. 

“Never. He’s watching now. If 
you hadn’t smashed the coolant 
tube, we’d still have a chance.” 
“I know,” Gregor said bitterly. 
“You and your ideas.” 

“My ideas ! I distinctly remem- 
ber you suggesting it. You said — ” 



“It doesn’t matter whose idea 
it was.” Gregor thought deeply. 
“Look, we know his internal scan- 
ning isn’t very good. When we 
reach the island, maybe we could 
cut his power cable.” 

“You wouldn’t get within five 
feet of it,” Arnold said, remem- 
bering the shock he had received 
from the instrument panel. 

“Hmm.” Gregor locked both 
hands around his head. An idea 
was beginning to form in the back 
of his mind. It was pretty tenu- 
ous, but under the circum- 
stances . 

“I am now scanning the island,” 
the lifeboat announced. 

Looking out the forward port- 
hole, Gregor and Arnold could 
see the island, no more than a 
hundred yards away. The first 
flush of dawn was in the sky, and 
outlined against it was the 
scarred, beloved snout of their 
spaceship. 

“Place looks fine to me,” Arnold 
said. 

“It sure does,” Gregor agreed. 
“I’ll bet our forces are dug in 
underground.” 

“They are not,” the lifeboat 
said. “I scanned to a depth of a 
hundred feet.” 

“Well,” Arnold said, “under the 
circumstances, I think we should 
examine a little more closely. I’d 
better go ashore and look 
around.” 

“It is deserted,” the lifeboat 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



said. “Believe me, my senses are 
infinitely more acute than yours. 
I cannot let you endanger your 
lives by going ashore. Drome 
needs her soldiers — especially 
sturdy, heat-resistant types like 



you.” 

“We like this climate,” Arnold 
said. 

“Spoken like a patriot!” the 
lifeboat said heartily. “I know 
how you must be suffering. But 
now I am going to the south pole, 
to give you veterans the rest you 
deserve.” 



G regor decided it was time 
for his plan, no matter how 
vague it was. “That won’t be 
necessary,” he said. 

“What?” 

“We are operating under spe- 
cial orders,” Gregor said. “We 
weren’t supposed to disclose them 
to any vessel below the rank of 
super-dreadnaught. But under 
the circumstances — ” 

“Yes, under the circumstances,” 
Arnold chimed in eagerly, “we 
will tell you.” 

“We are a suicide squad,” Gre- 
for said. 

“Especially trained for hot 
climate work.” 

“Our orders,” Gregor said, “are 
to land and secure that island for 
the Drome forces.” 

“I didn’t know that,” the boat 
said. 

“You weren’t supposed to,” 



Arnold told it. “After all, you’re 
only a lifeboat.” 

“Land us at once,” Gregor said. 
“There’s no time to lose.” 

“You should have told me 
sooner,” the boat said. “I couldn’t 
guess, you know.” It began to 
move toward the island. 

Gregor could hardly breathe. It 
didn’t seem possible that the sim- 
ple trick would work. But then, 
why not? The lifeboat was built 
to accept the word of its operators 
as the truth. As long as the ‘truth’ 
was consistent with the boat’s 
operational premises, it would be 
carried out. 

The beach was only fifty yards 
away now, gleaming white in the 
cold light of dawn. 

Then the boat reversed its en- 
gines and stopped. “No,” it said. 
“No what?” 

“I cannot do it.” 

“What do you mean?” Arnold 
shouted. “This is war! Orders — ” 
“I know,” the lifeboat said sad- 
ly. “I am sorry. A different type 
of vessel should have been chosen 
for this mission. Any other type. 
But not a lifeboat.” 

“You must,” Gregor begged. 
“Think of our country, think of 
the barbaric H’gen — ” 

“It is physically impossible for 
me to carry out your orders,” the 
lifeboat told them. “My prime 
directive is to protect my occu- 
pants from harm. That order is 
stamped on my every tape, giving 



THE LIFEBOAT MUTINY

priority over all others. I cannot 
let you go to your certain death.” 

boat began to move away 
from the island. 

“You’ll be court-martialed for 
this!” Arnold screamed hyster- 
ically. “They’ll decommission 
you.” 

“I must operate within my 
limitations,” the boat said sadly. 
“If we find the fleet, I will trans- 
fer you to a killerboat. But in the 
meantime, I must take you to the 
safety of the south pole.” 

The lifeboat picked up speed, 
and the island receded behind 
them. Arnold rushed at the con- 
trols and was thrown flat. Gregor 
picked up the canteen and poised 
it, to hurl ineffectually at the 
sealed hatch. He stopped himself 
in mid-swing, struck by a sudden 
wild thought. 

“Please don’t attempt any more 
destruction,” the boat pleaded. 
“I know how you feel, but — ” 

It was damned risky, Gregor 
thought, but the south pole was 



certain death anyhow. 

He uncapped the canteen. 
“Since we cannot accomplish our 
mission,” he said, “we can never 
again face our comrades. Suicide 
is the only alternative.” He took 
a gulp of water and handed the 
canteen to Arnold. 

“No! Don’t!” the lifeboat 
shrieked. “That’s water! It’s a 
deadly poison — ” 

An electrical bolt leaped from 
the instrument panel, knocking 
the canteen from Arnold’s hand. 

Arnold grabbed the canteen. 
Before the boat could knock it 
again from his hand, he had 
taken a drink. 

“We die for glorious Drome!” 
Gregor dropped to the floor. He 
motioned Arnold to lie still. 

“There is no known antidote,” 
the boat moaned. “If only I could 
contact a hospital ship . Its 
engines idled indecisively. “Speak 
to me,” the boat pleaded. “Are 
you still alive?” 

Gregor and Arnold lay perfect- 
ly still, not breathing.

‘‘Answer me!” the lifeboat 
begged. “Perhaps if you ate some 
geezel . .” It thrust out two 
trays. The partners didn’t stir. 

“Dead,” the lifeboat said. 
“Dead. I will read the burial 
service.” 

T here was a pause. Then the 
lifeboat intoned, “Great Spirit 
of the Universe, take into your 
custody the souls of these, your 
servants. Although they died by 
their own hand, still it was in 
the service of their country, fight- 
ing for home and hearth. Judge 
them not hashly for their impious 
deed. Rather blame the spirit of 
war that inflames and destroys all 
Drome.” 

The hatch swung open. Gregor 
could feel a rush of cool morning 
air. 

“And now, by the authority 
vested in me by the Drome Fleet, 
and with all reverence, I com- 
mend their bodies to the deep.” 
Gregor felt himself being lifted 
through the hatch to the deck. 
Then he was in the air, falling, 
and in another moment he was in 
the water, with Arnold beside 
him. 

“Float quietly,” he whispered. 
The island was nearby. But 
the lifeboat was still hovering 
close to them, nervously roaring 
its engines. 

“What do you think it’s up to 
now?” Arnold whispered. 



“I don’t know,” Gregor said, 
hoping that the Drome peoples 
didn’t believe in converting their 
bodies to ashes. 

The lifeboat came closer. Its 
bow was only a few feet away. 
They tensed. And then they heard 
it. The roaring screech of the 
Drome National Anthem. 

In a moment it was finished. 
The lifeboat murmured, “Rest 
in peace,” turned, and roared 
away. 

As they swam slowly to the 
island, Gregor saw that the life- 
boat was heading south, due 
south, to the pole, to wait for the 
Drome fleet.

The one way to kill the idea 



that murdered the world was:

Target One 



By FREDERIK POHL 



P erhaps we could have 
managed, some way or an- 
other to blow up Oak 
Ridge or the Hanford installa- 
tion. Certainly we could have 
tried, and I suppose that with ef- 
fort we should have found the 
way to do it. But it wouldn’t 
have been enough. Not nearly 
enough: The enemy wasn’t the 
Bomb any more, but e = mc^ it- 
self. As long as the seed was 
there, the fruit was bound to 
come. 



We had to destroy the seed, 
Marin was on the machine 
while Lee fed slugs of the fuel 
metal into the reactor. Marin 
was a capable man and so I was 
able to relieve the tension of the 
last few minutes before the trial 
by strolling out on the deck of 
the barge. 

It was a beautiful day, the 
wind from out at sea keeping 
fall-out from the mainland at a 
minimum. Before me was the 
Staten Island shore, trees and

sheer bare heights at the water’s 
edge; to my left was the shat- 
tered stalagmitic bed of New 
York. Even after all the decades, 
there was nothing green there. 
The rains that had washed the 
isotopes from Staten Island and 
watered its new growth of forest 
had hissed into steam on the 
island of Manhattan. It would be 
many decades before grass grew 
in its streets. 

One of the workers in the 
Staten Island stockpile waved to 
me, a quarter of a mile across the 
water, and I waved back. They 
wished us well, there on the 
island. All three of us had spent 
the previous evening ashore with 
them and the conversation had 
been loud and long. 

If we could succeed! 

If we could reverse the clock! 

So we drank our long, bitter 
toasts to success, and every man, 
woman and child in all the world 
toasted our efforts with us, all 
hundred and fifty thousand and 
more of them, for we all grew up 
in the ruins and the tradition of 
greatness and we knew what suc- 
cess would mean. 

“Jom!” Lee called from behind 
me. “Jom, we’re ready!” 

r hurried into the workdeck. 

Lee was standing at the door, 
but without a word he went back 
to his station at the reactor, not 
daring to leave it too long. His 



job, in some ways, was the most 
important of all. The reactor was 
tricky and dangerous and the 
K-mesons that powered the trial 
came only from a complicated 
fission-and-fusion reaction, hard 
to handle, deadly if it got out of 
control. 

Marin was already setting up 
his coordinates. I looked over his 
shoulder at the whirling colors 
on the screen; it was nothing you 
could recognize. Not yet. 

“I have the time now,” Marin 
said absently, cracking a vernier 
a hair from its null position. 
“But the tri-di readings are hard. 
If we could have started out from 
Switzerland in the first place — ” 

“What Switzerland?” I asked. 
The slag-heap on the Alps would 
not be fit to move around in for 
centuries. 

He said excitedly, “It’s com- 
ing, Jom!” He froze one setting 
at Lausanne’s elevation and 
dropped his hand to the range 
and deflection controls. Slowly 
the whirling began to make sense. 
We were watching a blur, and 
the blur smoothed out to become 
a racing mountainscape. We were 
flying over it, toward a city just 
appearing at the horizon. Marin 
kicked a floor switch and a trans- 
lucent city map of Lausanne 
lighted up on the wall before 
him. 

The screen seemed to drive 
across a lake, through a flicker- 



TARGET ONE 



77 



ing thicket of buildings, and 
jerked to a halt inside an audi- 
torium. 

Marin cried, “I can’t get it 
clear! The view field — ” 

“The view field is all right, 
Marin!” 

“But it’s so dark!” 

I fought back a hysterical 
laugh. “It’s dark because the 
lights are out, man! Your time 
adjustment is a little off, that’s 
all. Scan backward and forward.” 

He threw a quick, shame-faced 
grin at me over his shoulder and 
carefully fingered the fourth dial. 
The screen held its shadowy 
tableau for a moment; then the 
lights went on. Doll-like figures 
walked backward into the audi- 
torium as the stage’s curtain 
went up on actors taking bows. 
Marin was evidently scanning 
backward through time. 

“Not too far,” I cautioned him. 

He nodded and delicately 
twisted the dial backward, then 
forward. A dozen times the screen 
lighted and each time it was a 
pageant, or a rehearsal, or a mu- 
sical performance. 

Then Marin caught his breath 
and instinctively I clutched his 
shoulder. He locked the controls 
and we were silent for a moment, 
looking at what, back in those 
earliest twentieth -century days, 
had been a Swiss ceremony of 
graduation. 

Marin’s eyes were quicker than 



mine. He said steadily, “In the 
second row, third . no, fourth 
from the right. Is that him?” 

I counted off. There was no 
need to look back to the picture, 
torn from an old magazine, that 
we had pinned to the wall. It was 
a young, lean man in a curiously 
uncomfortable uniform and 
round pill-box hat. His eyes were 
abstracted, staring right through 
the audience in the hall into far 
reaches of remote thought. There 
was no pipe, no violin, no bushy 
white hair. 

There never would be any. 






the most precious thing on Earth. 

Marin was trembling. I cursed 
niyself for leaving him alone so 
long at this point, long enough to 
work himself into a state. 

“If we could travel in time — ” 
he began. 

“Time travel is impossible. 
Forget it!” 

“But we can’t just murder a 
man!” 

“Why not?” 

He exploded, “The greatest 
genius in theoretical physics who 
ever lived! A harmless, peaceful 
human being who never harmed 
a soul!” 



I T took nearly half an hour, 
once we had vectored in, for 
Lee to bring his reactor up to 
full charge. Lee was absorbed 
over his rods and slugs. Marin 
hovered close by his screen, 
though the controls were locked 
and he wasn’t really needed. But 
I had nothing to do and I 
stamped about the barge like an 
expectant father with a five-gen- 
eration history of gene-damage. 

When I went back into the 
workdeck, Marin said at once, 
“Jom, I can’t do it!” 

Lee went steadily on with his 
work. If he heard, he never 
showed it. 

I said angrily, “Don’t be an 
idiot!” Perhaps I was angriest 
because I was beginning to have 
my own doubts. We had all been 
brought up to hold human life as 



I said as forcefully as I could: 
“Two billion dead, Marin! Three 
continents wiped out! And every 
man alive mutating. How many 
brothers and sisters did you 
have, Marin?” 

He winced. “None that sur- 
vived,” he admitted. “But Ein- 
stein himself had nothing to do 
with it. The bombs were built by 
others.” 

“After he showed them the 
way. No, Marin! The world knew 
what was coming. Look through 
the books that survive, see how 
many frightening predictions 
there were of the horrors that 
would follow an atomic war. 
Right, weren’t they? And yet, 
once the theory was known, there 
was no way of preventing the 
war. There are always wars, 
Marin, but they don’t matter if 



they only kill off a fraction of the 
population. Only when they an- 
nihilate whole countries, then 
they matter!” 

Lee called, as calmly as though 
he had been back at the Univer- 
sity, “Ready now, Jom!” 

We looked at each other for a 
moment and I could read the re- 
vulsion in Marin’s eyes. 

“Well?” I demanded. 

I T had to be Marin at the con- 
trols; he had been the one 
who’d practiced, the one who’d 
designed the controls and knew 
how they worked. I might have 
found Lausanne easily enough 
myself, but I never could have 
focused the working leads of the 
timebinder to that tiny area in- 
side a human skull where we 
could do what had to be done. 

If time travel were possible — 
yes, Marin was right — then we 
could have gone to the young 
man, perhaps reasoned with him, 
perhaps bribed him, perhaps, if 
nothing else worked, abducted 
him from the past. But time 
travel was imp>ossible by defini- 
tion; matter cannot leave its 
locus in the chronon. 

But the K-mesons, those half- 
understood, hardly material par- 
ticles-that-werfi-waves — they 
were not bound by the laws that 
ruled crude matter. And though 
we could not move in time, we 
could direct a flow of K-mesons 



78

that would burn and destroy . 

Marin’s voice was harsh. “All 
right, Jom,” he said. 

I heard him at the controls, 
and when the whispering crackle 
of mesons lashed out and struck, 
I also heard that, but I did not 
watch the screen. Murder comes 
hard to me, too, whatever duty 
may force me to do. I had no 
stomach to watch the little figure 
in the screen jerk upright and 
slump over, no desire to see the 
abstracted light die out of those 
far-seeing eyes. 

And besides, I didn’t need to 
look at the screen to see what 
happened at the moment when 
the K-meson flow leaped out to 
destroy a brain. I had a window 
before me and I saw what hap- 
pened there. 

“Good Lord,’’ cried Lee, “look 
at all the boats!’’ 

That was all we could do for 
a moment, just look. Inside the 
K-meson field, we were invulner- 
able and untouchable. 

But the world was changing 
around us. 

Wrecked Manhattan sprang 
back to life. The harsh, familiar 
dust-cloud sky gave way to a 
curious blue, with white, fluffy 
clouds, such a sky as I had seen 
described in books, but had never 
thought to observe with my own 
eyes. And the harbor, the broad, 
slag-washed harbor of New York 
— which had seemed crowded 



when there were as many as three 
vessels in it at once — teemed with 
boats, big ones and small ones,

anchored barges and a floating 
giant, barely visible through the 
Narrows, that seemed the size of 
a city. 

process of change was 
complete and the K-meson 
field died away. 

Marin, still white-faced and 
trembling with the reaction, 
whispered, “Jom, Jom, it’s a 
whole new world!” 

And it was. A world we had 
never known; a world where 
there were millions, even billions 
of people, a world that had never 
been pressed through the grinder 
of nuclear war. 

A stubby power launch came 
dodging toward us through the 
clutter of smaller craft and a 
voice bellowed at us over a loud- 
hailer; “You there! You in the 
barge with green markings! 
Heave to and show your regis- 
tration and mooring permit!” 
He meant us. It would be quite 
a shock to him, I reflected wryly, 
when he saw what passed for our 
“papers.” Would he believe us? 
Would anyone in this world take 
our word for what we had done? 
Undoubtedly not. But they would 
learn, they would have to be- 
lieve, once they had a chance to 



look around our workdeck. The

wonders we could bring to them! 
For without Einstein, there 
would have been no nuclear 
piles; without the breeder reac- 
tors, no heavy elements in the 
high hundreds to decay into the 
power metal that fed our ma- 
chine and released the K-mesons. 

A smaller, faster vessel beat 
the launch to our side. It was a 
rickety, patched-up dinghy with 
a limping outboard motor push- 
ing it along, but it was light and 
it moved. Oddly, it made no 
great noise. I saw the outboard 
motor was driven from an elec- 
tric battery. 

From the dinghy, an eager 
voice called; “Cigarettes? Candy? 
Where you fellows from?” 

The three who crewed the 
dinghy were in their early teens; 
they wore ragged trousers and 
nothing else. They clamored up 
at us for tobacco, money, any- 
thing. Lee answered them, and 
perhaps I would have, too, but 
Marin drew me aside. 

“Jom, I don’t like this!” he 
said tensely. “I — I feel as though 
I’m strangling!” He was breath- 
ing hard, in fact, and I knew 
what he meant. There was some- 
thing about all those teeming 
hordes of people, the hundreds of 
big and little boats bobbing 
about, the swollen buildings on 
Manhattan and Staten Islands — 
I felt oppressed, too, as though I 
were stifling under a mound of 



crawling, twitching human- be- 
ings. 

But I told Marin curtly to 
shut up and advanced to meet 
the delegation from the power 
launch. 

It was an occasion for some 
ceremony, I thought. I said: 
“Welcome to our ship, friend 
from a world of peace and 
plenty.” 

^T^HE man in the prow of the 
-*■ launch paused with one knee 
over the side and stared at me. 
Then he shook his leg toward our 
boarding ladder. 

“Registration papers,” he said. 
“What kind of a tub is this, any- 
way?” 

“It’s a power barge used for 
scientific purposes,” I told him. 
“We come from a different world. 
We—” 

He said impatiently, “What 
kind of power? Electric? Don’t 
try to kid me, fellow; you’d never 
cross the Atlantic with electric 
power.” 

I shook my head. “The en- 
gines are gasoline, of course. But 
the—” 

“Gasoline!” The man’s look 
was suddenly intent. He wore a 
rather shabby blue uniform. I 
don’t think he made a move, but 
at that exact moment I realized 
he had a gun in a side-holster. 
“Let’s see the registration pa- 
pers,” he repeated. “Quick!” 



“We don’t have any.” I was 
getting exasperated. “We don’t 
come from your time at all — that 
is, it’s the same time, but a dif- 
ferent probability line. Don’t you 
understand? We . .” 

There was something about his 
expression. I stopped suddenly 
and thought for a second. Then I 
said, “Look, I’m sorry if I’m con- 
fusing. Take my word for it, this 
is something important and I 
can’t explain it to you. Can you 
put me in touch with a physi- 
cist?” 

“A what?” 

“A physicist, preferably one 
with a specialty in nucleonics. Or 
any scientist, for that matter.” 
He looked at me thoughtfully. 
“You don’t have a mooring per- 
mit, do you?” 

“No, of course not.” 

“I see.” He rubbed his chin. 
“Wait a minute,” he said, and 
clambered back down the side. I 
looked rather sternly around at 
my crew, fully aware that I had 
made a mess of our first contact 
with the world we had sired. But 
they were not acting very critical. 

Marin still looked scared. Lee 
was at the rail on the other side 
of the barge; he was pitching 
coins into the water, and the 
youths from the dinghy — in fact, 
people from half a dozen little 
boats, and not all of them youths 
— were diving after them, with a 
good deal of squabbling. 



The man in the blue uniform 
was back in a moment with an- 
other man, this one in a brown 
uniform, equally shabby. 

“ — case for the Feds, not us,” 
Blue Uniform was saying as they 
approached. “Possession of gas- 
oline, no papers, claims they come 
from abroad.” 

Brown Uniform nodded and 
said crisply to me, “You’ll have 
to come with us.” 

Blue Uniform asked sharply, 
“Where?” 

“New York City Hall, of 
course. This is a New York po- 
lice launch and — ” 

“And a two-state harbor pa- 
trol, mac! Don’t forget it! We’ll 
take him to Jersey City. None of 
your crummy slum families are 
going to settle on this barge. We 
need housing space as much as 
you do!” 

“What about the gasoline?” 
Brown Uniform yelled. “New 
York’s got a sixty per cent quota 
drag! We’re entitled to every drop 
that comes into the harbor until 
it’s made up and you can take — ” 
Blue Uniform suddenly 
shrugged. “Forget it,” he said in 
a different tone. “We could have 
worked something out. Well, 
never mind, mac. Here come the 
Feds, so we’re both out of luck.” 

T he Feds were as shabbily 
uniformed as the others, but 
they wore sharp visored caps.

and they took us neither to New 
York nor to New Jersey, but to 
the floating colossus beyond the 
Narrows, which turned out to be 
a sort of moored hulk doubling 
as a fort and administrative 
headquarters. It wasn’t an un- 
pleasant trip, except that the 
water was sludge-gray in color 
and stank as it sprayed over the 
wales. Since we weren’t going 
very fast, not much sprayed, 
which was a blessing. 

I said gratefully to the officer 
in charge of the boat, “Thanks 
for getting rid of those two. They 
didn’t seem able to understand 
what I was trying to say. If you 
can put me in touch with some 
sort of scientist. I’m sure I can 
explain things to him. You see, 
we’ve been doing research in 
parachronon penetration. Very 
important research. It is no ex- 
aggeration to say that every man 
alive today owes his life to us! 
Do you understand? It’s as if — ’’ 
He interrupted me. “How 
much gasoline have you got?” 

It was a clear waste of time to 
talk to this one, so I merely sat 
in silence until we arrived at the 
floating headquarters. They had 
refused to allow me to leave 
either Lee or Marin on the barge 
and I was feeling nervous about 
what the boarding party might 
be doing to our reactor. When I 
said something to Lee, though, he 
reassured me. 



“Not enough power in it now 
to hurt a kitten,” he said posi- 
tively. “We drained it dry on the 
bolt.” 

“Suppose they recharge the 
reactor?” I argued. 

“With what? We stockpiled all 
the reserve fuel. We couldn’t 
keep it in close proximity to the 
reactor, after all. No, don’t 
worry, Jom; they might mess up 
the instruments a little, but there 
won’t be any nuclear explosions, 
believe me. Relax. Look around 
and enjoy yourself. This is it, 
Jom, the world we’ve dreamed 
of! It isn’t an atomic wreck any 
more. It’s free, unspoiled, un- 
tainted.” 

I looked at him sharply, but 
there was no hint of mockery in 
his voice or his eyes. And, get- 
ting a grip on myself, I began to 
see that he was right. True, 
things were not exactly as I had 
always dreamed them in this new 
world. I hadn’t quite counted on 
the hordes of people, certainly 
more even than the history books 
told of, or the evident shortage of 
resources and raw materials. But 
there were no ray scars on New 
York City in this world and if 
Target One had never been 
blasted; surely the rest of the 
world escaped! 

I followed Lee’s advice : I re- 
laxed. 

Until they did as I asked and, 
after irritable wrangling, put me

in touch with a scientist whose 
specialty was nucleonjcs. 

“OO!” he hissed, eyes angry 
through the thick glasses, 
the silver insignia of rank on his 
collar glittering and dancing as 
he swallowed. “So you admit you 
have classified material on your 
barge!” 

I said wearily, “I tell you 
there’s nothing classified about 
it.” 

He stared at me. “Nothing 
classified about an atomic reac- 
tor?” he demanded. Only he 
spaced it out, each word with an 
angry emphasis of its own : Noth- 
ing. Classified. About. An. Atom- 
ic. Reactor? 

“Of course not! Not where we 
come from, I mean. I — ” 

“Enough!” he cut me off. “I 
mention to you two names; One 
is ‘V. S. Kretchwood.’ And the 
other — ” he looked at me shrewd- 
ly through the glasses — “is ‘Bra- 
zil.’ Am I correct?” 

“About what?” I asked, hon- 
estly puzzled. 

“Don’t try to make a fool out 
of me! You come from Brazil 
and your reactor is based on 
Kretchwood’s First Law. Don’t 
try to deny it!” 

I swallowed my anger and 
tried to placate him. “I have 
never been in Brazil in my life. 
I know where it is, yes. There is 
— ^there was, that is — a large pop- 

TARGET ONE 



ulation there, more than fifteen 
thousand. But this Kretchwood 
you talk of is absolutely new to 
me. Our reactor is based on Ein- 
stein’s equation, but I know you 
never heard of Einstein. That’s 
the whole point!” And I went 
through the whole explanation 
again. 

He passed his hand over his 
forehead. “Almost, I begin to be- 
lieve you. Silly of me, I know, 
but — ” 

“No, it isn’t silly! It’s the ab- 
solute truth,” I insisted. “I can 
prove it to you; just examine our 
workdeck. You who know noth- 
ing of atomic energy will find it 
hard to understand, but — ” 

“We do.” 

— “but matter and energy are 
the same — You what?” 

“We do know about atomic en- 
ergy,” he said. “That’s Kretch- 
wood’s First Law: E is greater 
than e-sub-n plus e-sub-o.” He 
scribbled it on a pad of paper: 
E>'n4-®o. “That is, the total en- 
ergy of an atom is more than the 
aggregate energy of its nuclear 
and orbital particles, which 
means that, by transmutation, 
energy can be released. V. S. 
Kretchwood, 1903-1986, if I re- 
member correctly.” 

I stared blankly. They knew 
about binding energy; they knew 
about fission and fusion ; they 
knew . 

“But you shouldn’t,” I said. “I

mean we’ve killed a man — No, 
excuse me; I’m a little upset. 
What you’re saying is that you 
are aware of the military and ci- 
vilian implications of atomic 
energy.” 

“There’s a thorium pile going 
right under your feet,” he said. 
“Uranium 235 — ” 

“Would be better, of course,” 
he nodded. “The problem of 
separation is being worked on.” 
“And you propose to make a 
bomb along the lines of the old 
Manhattan District?” 

“We call it Task Forty-four.” 
Lee and Marin and I ex- 
changed glances. “So there will 
be atomic warfare, after all,” I 
said dully. “But isn’t all this top 
secret?” 

“Of course,” said the angry lit- 
tle man with stars on his collar. 
“And yet you trust us?” 
“Where you’re going, it makes 
no difference. We have special — 
reserve areas, let’s say, for per- 
sons in improper possession of 
information about atomic en- 
ergy. You won’t spread anything 
you’ve learned.” 

“But there’s nothing improper 
about it! You said you believed 
us!” 

He leaned forward sharply. “I 
do,” he said in thick, hate-filled 
tones. “I believe it’s your doing 
that the world didn’t have an 
atomic war two hundred years 
ago. And while you’re in the re- 



serve areas, bear this in mind: / 
hope you rot there!” 

OING a dirge for one hundred 
^ and fifty thousand children of 
atomic cataclysm. We killed a 
man from the past and wiped 
them out, all of them, with their 
shattered, festering planet. 

And for nothing. 

It isn’t bad here, in the reserve 
area, though it is a little crowded. 
Ours — they call it the Mojave 
Resettlement Project — is the 
worst of the lot, because there 
just isn’t anything in the way of 
natural resources here. The soil 
gets fertile enough, with the Los 
Angeles sludge piped in, but the 
only water that comes in is right 
along with the sludge. All the sol- 
ids come out in the settling tanks 
and we kill the salts with ion- 
exchange. The smell and the 
taste stay right in the water, 
though. 

But we wouldn’t complain, if 
it were going to stay this way. 
We wouldn’t complain about the 
taste of the water, or the re- 
strictions on our freedom, or the 
congested state of the world. 
Fourteen billion people! 

They say that a century or so 
ago, there was a big campaign 
for birth control, back when 
there were only about five billion. 
But anyone can second-guess 
that: Some segments of the pop- 
ulation responded to the cam- 



86 GALAXYSCIENCEFICTION 




paign and most did not. The only 
result of the effort was that the 
generations following were even 
less susceptible to such a cam- 
paign. 

But, as I say, we wouldn’t 
complain, if we couldn’t see on 
the horizon the flat silhouette of 
Task Forty-four’s new group of 
breeder piles. I give us about a 
year more, that’s all. 

Marin has the bunk above 



mine. I don’t sleep much, and all 
through the night, I hear him 
tossing and turning and mutter- 
ing to himself. And if I listen 
closely, I can hear the words that 
are always the same: 

“Poor Dr. Einstein,” he says 
thickly, and then goes back to 
sleep. 

Poor Dr. Einstein! 

Poor us!

Origins 

of Galactic Advice 
to the Lovelorn 



I N 2534 U. E., all Advice to 
the Lovelorn counselors offi- 
cially came under the depart- 
mental designation 509. In Terran 
legend, 509 is the modern form 
of DIX, a Latin date supposedly 
fixing the birth of Advice to the 
Lovelorn in a chaplain’s office 
at a military fort in New Jersey. 

In 2604, a schizoid being find- 
ing himself in a jam learned that 

88 



the 509 he had sought and receiv- 
ed advice from was himself. This 
sharpened the realization that a 
questioner generally presents only 
one side of a problem — the ques- 
tioner’s — and that side in the 
most flattering light. As a result, 
a 509, or one of the 509’s detec- 
tives (called dix), tries to inves- 
tigate all sides. 

509ing has its dangers. Mer 



Perbran (2702-2812) of Propus 
II died in the line of duty; an 
empathetic telepath, he drowned 
in another being’s stream of con- 
sciousness. 

But 509ing has its compensa- 
tions. Bocediga Mani (3226-3312) 
of Matar II spearheaded the suc- 
cessful fight to forestall zeal- 
inflamed agents of museums. 
These, thinking to race against 
time, sought by any means, in- 
cluding kidnaping and quick- 
freezing of individuals, to lay in 
a hoard of specimens of a race 
growing rare, and by doing so 
were speeding the race’s doom of 
“phylum, phorgetum.” 

The following examples show 
how Advice to the Lovelorn grad- 
ually altered, how it grew from 
handling emotional problems on 
the interpersonal level to those 
on the supracultural level.

there are just the two of us in

make it even worse, I am often

selfishly says he is satisfied with 
things the way they are and does-

This is especially rattling be-

friends have started to insinuate 
that he’s stingy. And though I 
strongly deny such insinuations, 
I privately suspect that he’s un- 
willing to add to anything but 
his bundle. It embarrasses me so

Dear Sr. 509 Tib: Three dou- 
ble-moons ago, I married a priest- 
ess of the Marsupial Totem of 
Merope VI. Pretty quickly, I 
noticed a clicking sound when- 
ever she pranced. 

I found that her pouches — ^the 
fore pouch, at least; the after 
pouch has remained veiled — con- 
tained pellets of some kind and 
that, day by day, the fore pouch 
was emptying. 

I was very curious, but profane 
prying into the personal prac- 
tices of a priestess is prohibited, 
so I prudently put no questions. 
But I paid heed and it repaid 
me with a closer glimpse. 

The pellets were parched peas. 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Pleasing my spouse is my prime 
aim. Realizing she was partial to 
peas, I quickly purchased a quan- 
tity of best quality peas in the 
borso — enough to fill a twelve- 
gallon pot. And to surprise her, 
I quietly deposited some every 
evening while she pounded the 
pillow. 

My peak performance came 
on the night I poured a palmful 
of peas without provoking a quiv- 
er in response. 

But although I patiently pre- 
vented her supply from petering 
out, a pall fell upon her. I quad- 
rupled my pains. But as time 
passed, she acquired a Tower of 
Pisa posture and a paranoiac 
look. This worried me, the more 
so as she had let drop that she 
was to undergo the added strain 
of presiding at secret ceremonies. 

Nine days ago, late on the Day 
of the Didelphic Oracle, I was 
foggily pondering the problem of 
restoring her physical and psychic 
balance, when a posse of priest- 
esses paraded into our home. 
Their measured pace was like the 
pounding pulse of aoom. As one, 
they stopped and, ignoring me, 
gave my wife a pregnant look. 

It was more than she could 
bear. With a piercing cry, she 
lost her self -possesion and passed 
into a coma. The posse departed 
as it had come. 

On waking, my wife withdrew 
into a shell. She sits staring at 



the opposite wall. Please tell me 
how to help her regain her poise. 

Oura 

Dear Oura: I’m not privy to 
the Marsupial Mysteries, but I 
think I can unperplex you. The 
way I figure it, you’re the preci- 
pitating factor. 

Your wife wasn’t eating the 
peas. She was transposing one pea 
per day from her fore pouch to 
her after pouch. They weren’t 
her particular passion. They were 
for computing the passage of 
time. 

Your interfering made her lose 
count, stuffed her after pouch 
full to bursting, gave her a list 
and a persecution complex. 

Both of you should have mind- 
ed your proverbial Ps and Qs. 
Your wife should have perceived 
peril more promptly. The excess 
pea avoirdupois should have giv- 
en her the cue. Instead of appar- 
ently going haywire and thrust- 
ing peas into her after pouch, 
regardless of the count, she should 
have immediately subtracted the 
number of peas there from the 
number of days from festival to 
festival. In that way, she would- 
n’t have let the Day of the Di- 
delphic Oracle find her missing 
from her post. 

Her sister priestesses plainly 
consider this a grave infraction. 
There’s no telling how they’d 
react if you were quixotic enough

But I had seen stop-motion

tion that she wasn’t, you pass 
over several elements lightly. 

Doesn’t it seem strange that, in 
seven years of wedded bliss, an

induced sympathetic vibration 
has never, even momentarily, put 
you in phase with your wife? 

You’ve resisted. Admit it now, 
you didn’t really want to see her. 
You’ve been content with a blur, 
for even the “genuine love” 
couldn’t have come up to your 
unaging image of her. 

You could end your doubts by 
snapping a fostat of your wife or 
by shining a stroboscopic light on 
her in the dark, flashing it in time 
with her vibration to see her as 
clearly as If she were frozen. But 
you prefer to preserve the image 
in your mind. 

So consider this possibility : 
your wife may be neither what 
you term the homely sister nor 
what you term the homelier sis- 
ter. She may be what you think 
of as the lovely sister. 

You’ll come to believe this. The 
pendulum will swing from pes- 
simism to optimism. When. you 
reach the far end of the arc, have 
your local doctor dose you with 
titanium (for mordant) and chlo- 
rine (for substitution reaction). 
These chemicals will lock you in 
the blissful state you desire — un- 
til the next family reunion.

But to begin at the beginning. 

I was standing out in the open, 
forgetting my mother’s preach-

shadow. Before I could even think 
of trying to escape or to call out 
for help, a highwheeling figure 
swooped down upon me. My 
heartbeat drowned in the win- 
nowing of his wings and I faint- 
ed. 

When I came to, I was in the

antechamber of the nest of a 
young male whom I have known 
ever since my pre -nubile days. 
I had held him in high awe, but 
this about-facing of his tore away 
the veil and I can see him for 
what he is — the antithesis of 
honor. 

He laughs as I cry. He and his 
myrmidons are keeping me cap- 
tive against my will and seem to 
enjoy watching me throw dust in 
my eyes. I wring my antennae in 
vain. The vulgar creature is 
adamant, even though he does 
try to soothe me occasionally 
with butter words and the prom- 
ise of brand-new lithium-beryl- 
lium furnishings for this nest. 

But such antics just make me 
bridle and antagonize me the 
more. “Enough]” I say sternly, 
italicizing the word. And my 
thoughts go back to that moment 
when I stood in the clearing. How 
my chest expanded with hope — 
hope that I might always main-

the shadow, little did I anticipate

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Dear 509 Munkar: O hear me, 

I beg of you! I am of the Mar- 
ababa Sahem tribe on the out- 
lying planet Tau Pegasi CXV. 
Recently I moved to the ornate 
state capital and married a girl 
of the Aaabb Abaaa Babab tribe, 
love triumphing over distaste for 
these fashionable, dissolute mem- 
bers of the ruling circle. 

O I never would have become 
incensed about — much less ques- 
tioned — my wife’s faithfulness 
hadn’t I a good friend who in 
all innocence idly asked me, at a 
party, for the name of the seduc- 
tive perfume my wife was wear- 
ing. 

With an effort of will, I dis- 
guised the dismay that threatened 
to distend my veins. I told him 
calmly that I had forgotten the 
name, but would let him know 
it as soon as I recalled. 

At home, at the first opportuni- 
ty, I searched. At last I discov- 
ered an ounce of Carvyl Eau de 
Fen 9 hidden behind flush-seam- 
ed paneling. 

To hear was shock enough, 
but O when I saw that my wife 
was indeed wearing perfume, 
not hell or the dismal hereafters 
of the sextillion planets could 
equal the pardonable jealousy 
that began to quinch in my vitals. 

She is not using the scent to 
please me. O no! We of Marababa 
Sahem have no sense of smell. 

Ergo, she is using the perfume 




to lure into baneful dalliance 
other males, members of her own 
tribe, who are able to smell. (O 
I discount my good friend, al- 
though he is one of them. I owe 
him so much for unwittingly en- 
lightening me.) 

Even in my distress, I must 
admire the way the fair betrayer 
hides demon amid devotion. But 
the many little things that she 
sashays around doing for me 
mean simply so many disquieting 
duplicities and ring hollowly now 
that her disloyalty is disclosed. 
O even the venison ragout that 
she learned to dish Marababa 
Sahem style to please me is a bur- 
den to down without disgorging: 
it has me gargling and grunting 
and panting under the grueling 
grind of displaying a dissem- 
bling smile as if singing a hymn 
to her handiwork. 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC ADVICE TO THE LOVELORN 



95 





Dissolving this dishonored mar- 
riage is out of the question. By 
the fundamental law of my tribe, 
I must wreak vengeance upon 
her. With this end in view, I am 
husbanding my strength. When 
I feel my hate dislodge my love, 
I will slay her, lest she cheat 
and recheat and bring disgrace 
upon us. 

O it seems odd that I should 
be discussing the snatching of 
life from the one I believed the 
quintessence of discretion — so odd 
that I would be laughing if such 
laughter did not hurt. 

But I must prove I am no 
mere cipher in a divided duty to 
benighted love, but a thing of 
elemental passions, true to the 
traditions of my tribe. 

O distinguished 509, please 
lend me your moral support! 

Loc Osis 

Dear Loc: Very melodramatic, 
but don’t be so ready to listen 
to your so-called friend. 

He was being vindictive when 
he asked you what perfume your 
wife wears. Dix-informed, I can 
tell you he’s a scorned ex-suitor 
of your wife’s. Plainly, he’s vent- 
ing his spite. 

Your wife wears perfume; 
that’s so. But you infer wrongly. 
True, she’s not wearing it to 
please you, except indirectly. 

Being unable to smell, you 
haven’t realized that your un- 



complaining wife uses perfume to 
mask the what-is-to-her-nose- 
distasteful smell of the what-is- 
to-your-eye-cordial showers of 
magnesium and chlorine that 
spice your food. 

Even if that weren’t the case, 
it would still be only natural for 
a wife to want to smell her best, 
even if her husband couldn’t ap- 
preciate it. 

At any rate, you’ll have to 
sublimate your venous rage — my 
dix have warned your friend to 
leave the planet. He’s probably 
a good distance past Alhena by 
now.

question and the form letter in 
answer. 

Dear 509 Ondas: I desire to

loving but of coveting. You won’t 
offer the girl your love and ask 
for her alula in marriage, because 
she might turn you down and 
your pride won’t let you risk 
refusal. You won’t attempt to 
run off with her yourself, because 
you might slip up and to fail 
would puncture your pride. 

Although your authorities, be- 
lieving that fair facts and foul 
are equally valid when it comes 
to love, condone the hiring of 
mercenaries, I must counsel you 
to heed the sad case of Vry Nin. 

The lovesick and pridesick Nin, 
smarting under the rebuff of his 
suit, hired mercenaries from 
Gamma Vulpeculae. He tried to 
make the briefing short because 
he found their presence repulsive. 

He promised Oca, their cap- 
tain, a lordly gift if the legion 
the latter headed followed orders 
to the letter. The mercenaries 
listened impassively as Nin mark- 
ed out the acts they were to per- 
form. The simple eyes dotting 
their torsos stared stonily, even 
though the vehemence of Nin’s 
spite, when he ordered the slay- 
ing of the girl’s family, sprayed 
them with yellow mist. 

But when he came to describe 
his love object, the mist turned 
rose. How could he convey the 
tantalizing texture of her shape- 
ly— 

He lacked words. So he said, 
“You’ll see there the very most 




beautiful creature in creation. 
That’s my loved one.’’ 

Dismissed, they padded away. 
It seemed to Nin he waited for a 
mega-era. At last they padded 
back. 

Nin looked for the girl eagerly 
but vainly. 

Had her family outbid him 
and turned the fire of the mercen- 
aries back upon Nin? 

He grabbed for his weapon, 
but Oca was quicker. 

He explained to the dying Nin 
that the girl’s family had appar- 
ently feared a raid and must have 
spirited the girl away. Wary of 
booby traps, the mercenaries had 
searched the house. They had 
found only a warped and warty 
crone. Following Nin’s orders, 
they had blasted her.

509 Ondas 



F rom the microtUes of Dod 
Ona (2971-3152) of Naos III. 
After long years of service, he 
met his death when a galloping 
herd of suozzons mistook the 
creaking of his sinews — the key 
thongs, to be exact — for their 
mating call. 

Dear 509 Ona: The log of 
the Griph, my spacecraft, shows 
I am asking you the same ques- 
tion for the third time. Why don’t 
you answer? 

I’ll restate the facts. 

I made a forced landing in a 
clearing on Alpha Pj-xidis I. I 
leafed through the Universal Per- 
iplus in my chart room, but it’s 
sadly out of date and tells me 
nothing about this system. I de- 
termined for myself that condi- 
tions on this planet were favor- 
able, debarked, made repairs. 

There was nothing to hold me; 
the planet seemed only virgin 
forest. I was about to re-embark 
when a figure suddened in and 
out of sight. A girl. No more than 
a glimpse of olive complexion and 
willowy form, but it was enough 
to quicken my pulse. 



I followed her into the forest. 
Gone! I would have called, but 
my fear of further frightening 
her caused the opening between 
my vocal cords to stick. All that 
afternoon, I looked. 

With the coming of dusk, I felt 
a chill and thought to fell a tree 
for fuel. But immediately a cheer- 
ful warmth enveloped me and 
I made my way craftward in a 
glow. 

Early next morning, I seemed 
to hear a voice calling faintly. 
I was soon at the edge of the 
clearing. Something drew my 
gaze to a tree -hollow. My hand 
came out with a crude valentine. 

It bore my name. 

I reasoned that colonists of my 
kind had settled here secretly, 
that the girl had seen me and was 
shyly making known her love. 




She’d slipped into the Griph while 
I was hunting her through the 
wood, learned my name from my 
log. 

Elated, I waited the next 
manifestation. 

It was a makeshift mailbox 
hung on a tree. Lettered on it 
was “Jeanie.” I’ve always liked 
that name. 

Something white fluttered 
ghostlike down from a tree across 
the clearing. No one around. I 
dived for it. A blank sheet of 
paper. Getting the idea, I wrote 
a love letter on it and dropped it 
in the slot. 

I went back to the Griph to 
spruce up. When I returned to 
the mailbox, the letter was gone. 

Since then, a stream of mes- 
sages. For some reason, Jeanie 
keeps shifting the mailbox from 
tree to tree. 

Sometimes I think we’ve try- 
sted in isolated places, because 
I dimly remember embracing 
Jeanie. Sometimes Jeanie seems 
less than a dream, a fragment 
of a figment, a delusion — at these 
times. I’ve tried to reach yqu. 

Have I been traveling alone 
too long? 

I can’t account for my fleeting 
moods. A while ago, I started 
to carve an arrow-pierced heart 
in a tree, but something stayed 
my knife hand. 

Another time, I began to wor- 
ry that my food was running low. 



it 



Magically, I found a plant bear- 
ing something like a cross be- 
tween breadfruit and hackberry 
— just when I’d decided to give up 
the elusive Jeanie, and leave. 

Where are Jeanie’s folks? 
Where is Jeanie now? I can’t 
stand not knowing. I’m loth to 
stay, loth to go. 

Please answer. 

R. A. Jesse 

Dear R. A.: I’ve deliberately 
delayed answering. Sorry to 
blight your romance after letting 
you pine for 71 days, but that’s 
the length of the mating season. 

Let me explain. You’re not loco. 
You have been involved in a 
budding romance, but not your 
own. 

“Jeanie” exists, though only in 
your mind. 

The Alpha Pyxidites made her 
bloom there. 

They’re the trees. They palm 
off telepathic suggestion on mo- 
bile forms of life. 

For your appointment in lieu 
of samara (if you’ll pardon a 
pedantic quip), they adapted to 
your unconscious desire to meet 
your dream mate. 

You may leave now, knowing 
you’ve won laurels as a pollinat- 
ing middleman. You may also 
legally claim a reasonable serv- 
ice charge.

man’s best friend 

By EVELYN E. SMITH 



Sometimes a job comes after 



the man . and this one came 



after Gervase like a tiger! 



T he annunciator aroused 
Gervase from pleasant 
semi-slumber. He knew the 
interruption was his own fault 
for not having turned off the de- 
vice, but he so seldom had a 
visitor that he could hardly be 
blamed for his forgetfulness. 
Frowning, he pressed the viewer 
button. A round, red face ap- 
peared on the screen. “May I be 
the first to congratulate you, Mr. 
Schnee?” it said. 



“You may, indeed,” Gervase 
replied. “But for what?” 

“You haven’t heard the news? 
Good, then I’m the first. I im- 
agine I got a head-start on the 
others because of my superior fa- 
cilities for locating you. Your 
address wasn’t given; these pro- 
nouncements do tend to be a bit 
vague. Matter of tradition, I 
suppose.” 

“I haven’t heard any news for 
days,” Gervase said, uncomfort-

ably conscious that he was apol- 
ogizing. “I’ve been listening to 
my sound-tapes and — and medi- 
tating,” he added defiantly. 
“Wait a minute; I’ll let you in.” 

He struggled with the door- 
stud, but the door refused to 
open. The autobursar must have 
neglected to pay the door bill — 
probably because Gervase had 
failed to put enough money into 
it. But his allowance was limited 
and sound-tapes, not to speak of 
meditators, were so expensive. 

Sighing, Gervase got up and 
opened the door manually. The 
individual outside was short and 
stout and dressed, unfortunately, 
in the uniform of an upper-eche- 
lon salesman. Gervase had been 
caught! Still, he reminded him- 
self, no one could force him to 
buy anything. He was a free citi- 
zen. 

“Well, come in if you must,” 
he said grudgingly. “I suppose 
the big news is that j’m the lucky 
householder to whom the Little 
Gem Room Expander will first 
be offered.” 

“Nothing of the sort!” the man 
replied indignantly. 

At this point, Gervase noticed 
with surprise that the other wore 
a jeweled merchant-prince’s 
badge. Apparently this was one 
of those consumer reaction tests 
in which executives themselves 
participated to check on their 
employees. 



T he man remembered to smile. 

“The Prognosticator has iust 
given its fortnightly Prognostica- 
tion. You, Mr. Schnee, are going 
to be our new Ruler.” He seized 
the young man’s limp hand and 
shook it enthusiastically. “And 
I’m sure you’ll be a splendid one, 
too.” 

Gervase accepted a pale green 
cheroot from the dispenser. It 
shook in his lips. “And what’s 
to become of the old Ruler?” 
“You’re scheduled to dispose 
of him sometime this month. 
Now, Mr. Schnee,” the man went 
on briskly, “allow me to intro- 
duce myself. I am Bedrich Flo- 
rea, vice president of the Florea 
Munitions and Container Corpo- 
ration.” He extracted a gleaming 
weapon from his brief case and 
offered it to Gervase. The young 
man recoiled. “If you will only 
agree to shoot Overlord Kipp 
with a Florea Semper Fidelis 
Gun,” the executive continued, 
“my corporation will be happy 
to place a substantial amount of 
credits at your disposal in any 
bank you choose. Six billion, to 
be exact. Now if you’ll just sign 
here on the dotted line . .” He 
held out a stylus temptingly. 

“Nonsense!” Gervase backed 
away. 

“Even a Ruler can use money. 
Bribery for government officials, 
bread and circuses for the people 
— oh, money’s a very useful com-

modity, Mr. Schnee. Shall we say 
seven billion?” 

“I don’t doubt that money is 
useful,” Gervase replied, think- 
ing wistfully of seven billion 
credits. “But when I said ‘non- 
sense,’ I meant the Prognosti- 
cator. The whole thing’s a lot of 
— well, nonsense. A whole planet 
of supposedly intelligent people 
listening to what’s nothing more, 
really, than an oracle! A machine 
can’t read the future. It’s impos- 
sible.” 

Florea’s eyes bulged. “Mr. 
Schnee, that’s sacrilege! You 
can’t — confound it, sir, you can’t 
talk that way about The Ma- 
chine. After all,” he added in a 
more placatory manner, “let’s 
look at this reasonably. Machines 
can and do answer all the prob- 
lems of our daily life, so why 
shouldn’t a superior machine be 
able to tell the future?” 

“If you ask me,” Gervase all 
but sneered, “behind the wires 
and gimmicks and whatnots in 
The Machine, there’s a secret 
room in which a half-mad, half- 
intoxicated old priestess sits 
delivering her Delphic pronounce- 
ments. Might as well have an 
aboveboard oracle and be done 
with it.” 

“Now, now, Mr. Schnee — ” the 
executive smiled with obvious ef- 
fort — “even our Ruler shouldn’t 
flout the Authority of Machin- 
ery. Of course, it’s all right when 



you’re alone with friends, like 
me, but in public — ” 

The annunciator sounded 
again. An eager face appeared on 
the screen. “Mr. Schnee,” an 
equally eager voice said, “I’m 
from the Daily Disseminator. 
How does it feel to be Ruler 
Prognosticate?” 

There was the sound of a scuf- 
fle. His face disappeared, to be 
replaced by two others. “Mr. 
Schnee, will you tell us in your 
very own words — ” 

As Gervase clicked off the in- 
terviewer, the vidiphone blinked. 
Gervase lifted the receiver. The 
face of Overlord Kipp himself 
came into view, pale but com- 
posed. “I understand you’re the 
young man who is destined to 
dispose of me and take my 
place?” 

G ervase paled also. “Hon- 
estly, Your Honorship, I 
haven’t the slightest inten — ” 
“You’ll make it quick and 
painless, won’t you? And it really 
would be very decent of you to 
give me the exact day and hour 
of my — er — demise so I won’t 
have to sit around waiting.” 
“But, really — ” 

“You don’t look like a hard- 
hearted chap. As a matter of fact, 
I would say, offhand, that you 
had a kind face.” 

“Well, thank you, but — ” 

“I do wish you’d stop shilly-

shallying and name the day. By 
the way, have you anything on 
for tomorrow?” 

“I didn’t have anything spe- 
cial planned — ” 

“Splendid! Suppose you come 
over to the Palace around one 
o’clock or so. We can have a bite 
of lunch and discuss the matter 
together. After all, I think you’ll 
agree that I have been a reason- 
ably good Ruler and so I have 
the right to die with dignity.” He 
looked pleadingly at Gervase. 

“Oh, absolutely,” the young 
man said in haste. “No question 
of it. I think it’s a very good idea 
to have a chat about it first. 
Awkward to — dispose of someone 
you haven’t met previously.” 

The dictator gave him a wan 
smile. “Thank you, Mr. Schnee. 

I hope you’ll find your successor 
as cooperative as yourself.” 

The screen darkened. 

“Hmmm,” Gervase mused. He 
took a lavender cheroot, forget- 
ting he still held the lime one. “I 
wonder whether he wants me to 
make an appointment so he’ll 
have a band of counter-assassins 
ready to kill me, saving him the 
expense of a stand-by guard. He 
is noted for his thriftiness, you 
know. Perhaps I just shouldn’t 
show up at all.” 

“He wouldn’t dream of doing 
anything of the sort,” Florea said 
austerely. “Overlord Kipp knows 
what is due to his position. He 



has a sense of duty and responsi- 
bility which, unfortunately, seems 
to be lacking in his successor . , 
if you’ll excuse my speaking 
frankly,” he added in haste. “I 
am, of course, considerably older 
than you and so I feel — ” 

“It’s quite all right,” Gervase 
reassured him. “You may speak 
freely.” 

“Furthermore,” Florea con- 
tinued, “if he had you killed, the 
people would probably give him 
a painful and lingering death for 
attempting to interfere with the 
course of destiny . There, I 
hear them now!” 

And they could indeed hear 
the sound of voices raised in song 
— so many and so loud that they 
penetrated the soundproofing of 
the walls. “The polloi are coming 
to hail their new Leader,” Florea 
beamed. 

“Well, I’m not going to do it!” 
Gervase declared. “They can’t 
make me kill him and take over 
and that’s flat. I’m not the ad- 
ministrative type — never have 
been.” 

W^LOREA took a cheroot of his 
own out of a platinum porta- 
ble. “In that case, the people 
probably will kill you for at- 
tempting to interfere with fate.” 
“But I wouldn’t haVe done 
anything!” Gervase protested. 

“There are sins of omission as 
well as commission. Come now.

it’s true a Ruler’s life expectancy 
isn’t very long — at least it hasn’t 
been for the last few reigns — but 
it’s longer than yours will be if 
you refuse to fulfill your des- 
tiny.” 

“I wouldn’t make a fit Ruler,” 
Gervase said desperately. “Con- 
sider my origins. I wouldn’t tell 
this to anyone but you — I’m il- 
legitimate. I don’t even know 
who my father is.” 

The other man smiled again. 
“It’s a wise child who knows his 
own father. And some of the 
most celebrated leaders in history 
have been illegitimate. Look at 
William the Conqueror.” 

Gervase turned on the histori- 
scope, dialed 1066 A.D., looked, 
shuddered, and turned it off. “I 
don’t think that’s much of a rec- 
ommendation !” 

“You see,” Florea told him en- 
couragingly, “almost anybody 
can be a leader. The important 
thing is that he be destined for 
leadership.” 

“But I’m no good! Everybody 
says so. I’ve never done a thing 
in my life. My aged mother has 
had to work to support me.” 

“Time enough that you stood 
on your two feet, my boy!” the 
businessman said, clapping the 
youth upon the shoulder. “And 
remember, destiny must take its 
course.” 

He flung open the door. A 
cheering crowd stood outside. 

MAN'S BEST FRIEND 



“My friends, allow me to intro- 
duce you to your new Ruler — 
Gervase Schnee!” 

A hoarse shout of approval 
went up. 

“He is planning to assassinate 
Overlord Kipp with a Florea 
Semper Fidelis Gun. Florea Sem- 
per Fidelis Guns retail from c2. 98 
for the Peasant’s Pistol all the 
way up to C1089.56 for the Super 
Deluxe Conspirator’s Model, but 
each is the best obtainable for the 
price. Mr. Schnee, of course, will 
use the Super Deluxe model.” 
There were more cries, cheers 
and shouts. 

“Thank you for your — for your 
confidence and support,” Gervase 
said brokenly. “I only hope I 
prove worthy of them.” 

Gervase lunched with Over- 
lord Kipp the next day and was 
not assassinated. The disposal 
was set for the coming Tuesday 
and announced to the public. 
Gervase was so nervous, he 
couldn’t sleep the night before. 
When, early in the morning, he 
finally did manage to doze off, 
he was awakened by the encour- 
aging telegrams that kept pour- 
ing in. 

At nine, he finally got up and 
dressed himself in the immacu- 
late black-and-silver assassin’s 
uniform that had been custom- 
made for him without charge by 
an eminent tailor. He was in no 
mood for breakfast, so he went 

105 



outside to the handsome black- 
and -silver limousine that had 
been presented to him by a 
thoughtful industrialist. As he 
emerged from his door, a brass 
band struck up the national an- 
them and the crowd waiting out- 
side broke into cheers suitably 
restrained to fit the melancholy 
occasion. 

ERVASE bowed wanly left 
and right as he got into the 
car. His two hired assistants, 
dressed in the customary black 
cloak and hood of the body-re- 
mover, were, he noticed, already 
seated beside the chauffeur. They 
did not turn their heads as Ger- 
vase entered, but preserved the 
traditional impassivity of their 
calling. 

The band started to play a fu- 
neral march as the car moved 
slowly down the boulevard. 
Stands had been put up all along 
the route and he was greeted by 
subdued cheering and applause 
from crowds neatly arranged ac- 
cording to rank. Little children 
of all classes rushed out into the 
street to present him with bou- 
quets of flowers. 

The television cameras joined 
him en route and followed him 
all the way to the Palace. On the 
steps, Bedrich Florea awaited 
him, magnificently garbed in full 
executive uniform, his jewels 
flashing in the clear sunlight. 



“Allow me to load your Super 
Deluxe Conspirator’s Florea 
Semper Fidelis Gun for you. 
Overlord Prognosticate,” he an- 
nounced in a ringing voice, as he 
turned his profile toward the 
cameras. 

“It’s already loaded,” Gervase 
said, nervously clutching the gun 
in his pocket. 

“Permit me to check it then.” 
Florea put out an eager hand. 

Gervase executed a deft chasse 
in the opposite direction. “It’s 
perfectly all right, I tell you! No 
one,” he added in a burst of in- 
spiration, “would have any diffi- 
culty in loading a Florea Semper 
Fidelis Gun.” 

“That’s right,” the baffled mu- 
nitions magnate admitted, falling 
back reluctantly. “Whether you 
buy the Peasant’s or the Con- 
spirator’s Model, both have the 
same smooth free-loading mech- 
anism . .” 

“Out of the way. Executive,” 
a cameraman said, unceremoni- 
ously sweeping Florea aside as 
Gervase paced into the Palace, 
followed by his two black-robed 
henchmen, carrying an elaborate, 
gold-mounted stretcher between 
them. 

“Candy, popcorn, hashish, yo- 
ghurt!” yelled a strident voice 
behind them. “Buy your refresh- 
ments here!” 

Overlord Kipp stood beside his 
desk, dressed in his finest uni- 



106

form — which was, however, virtu- 
ally invisible, it was so bedecked 
with glittering and sparkling 
medals and decorations. Gervase 
waited patiently while the soon- 
to-be-disposed-of Ruler made a 
speech pointing out the numer- 
ous benefits and improvements 
his reign had brought to the peo- 
ple. It was rather a long speech 
and Gervase’s nose began to itch. 
He would have liked to scratch 
it, but the cameras were pointing 
directly at him. Life as Ruler, he 
saw, was going to be a long series 
of similar repressions. He sighed. 
But what could he do? Nobody 
could go against the Prognosti- 
cations. 

Finally the speech was fin- 
ished. “Good-by and good luck. 
Overlord Schnee,” Kipp said. He 
stood, waiting. 

Gervase fired. There was a 
loud report. Kipp crumpled to 
the ground. 

Gervase hurled the Florea 
Semper Fidelis Gun to the desk. 
“Everyone will now please 
leave,” he ordered in calm but 
firm tones, “while the removers 
take over.” 

“Why can’t we televise the re- 
moval?” a daring cameraman 
asked. “Something new.” 

T HERE was a shocked silence 
and then a babble of indig- 
nant voices. Gervase held up a 
weary hand. The voices stopped. 



“That sort of thing just isn’t 
done,” he told the cameraman 
with an Olympian smile. “Please 
leave as quickly as possible — all 
of you. I might want to medi- 
tate.” 

They scuttled out backward, 
the cameras still grinding. Ger- 
vase pressed the studs that shut 
and bolted the door. 

“Whew!” said Overlord Kipp, 
sitting up. “I didn’t think I’d be 
able to stand that much longer. 
You’re a good shot, Schnee — ^that 
blank stung like crazy. And in a 
very tender spot, I might add-’ 

“No time for chatting,” Ger- 
vase said nervously. “We’ve got 
to get this over in a hurry. Now 
comes the part when your friends 
will have to look like real re- 
movers. I hope they can give it 
that professional touch.” 

“We are real removers in a 
sense,” said one of the black- 
robed figures. “At least, both of 
us have participated in removals 
before.” They dropped their 
hoods. 

Gervase’s mouth hung open. 
“Why, you’re Overlord Moor- 
house!” he said to one. “And I’ve 
seen pictures of you!” he told the 
other. “You’re the one that came 
before him — Shinnick. You died 
before I was born — that is, you 
were supposed to have died. Both 
of you were. Moorhouse killed — 
was supposed to have killed you. 

Ex-Overlord Shinnick smiled. 



MAN'S BEST FRIEND

“We’re not precisely dead — only 
retired, you might say. In a way, 
anonymity is the same as death. 
And Overlords Moorhouse and 
Kipp — ’’ he bowed toward them — 
“both had kind hearts, like your- 
self. The Prognosticator didn’t 
say we had to be killed — just dis- 
posed of, as Kipp undoubtedly 
pointed out to you in your little 
talk together.” 

“Sorry I couldn’t tell you the 
truth,” Kipp apologized as he 
dusted off his uniform, “but you 
might have changed your mind 
and given us away.” 

“We’ve formed a sort of little 
club of dead Overlords,” Shin- 
nick elucidated. “After all, we’re 
the only ones with whom we can 
associate safely — no danger of 
any one of us betraying the 
others.” 

“We’re looking forward to the 
day when you join us, Overlord 
Schnee,” Moorhouse put in eag- 
erly, “assuming that your suc- 
cessor is of as generous a nature 
as we, of course. Do you play 
bridge by any chance?” 

“You’d better hurry.” Gervase 
worriedly changed the subject as 
he noticed the time on the wall 
chronometer. “If the four of us 
are discovered, the mob would 
tear us all to pieces.” 

“Right you are,” said ex-Over- 
lord Shinnick. “Get on the 
stretcher, Kipp. Bad enough we’re 
going to have to carry you out; 



at least don’t expect us to lift you 
up.” 

Kipp obediently assumed a re- 
cumbent posture. Shinnick and 
Moorhouse covered him with a 
black cloth and were preparing to 
march out when Gervase recol- 
lected himself and halted them. 
“Wait a moment — you’d better 
take off those medals first, Kipp, 
They come with the job.” 

“Grave-robber,” said Kipp, 
reluctantly sitting up on his cat- 
afalque and unfastening the jew- 
eled decorations. 

Vl^HEN the little procession 
had left, Gervase pressed a 
stud on the desk marked Secre- 
tary. A panel in the wall opened 
and a timorous-looking man vir- 
tually fell into the room. “Y-yes, 
Your Honorship?” 

“The Prognosticator is right 
here in the Palace, isn’t it?” Ger- 
vase asked, in a tone that would 
have been authoritative if his 
voice hadn’t cracked right in the 
middle of Palace. 

“Y-yes, Your Honorship.” 
“Lead me to it immediately.” 
“Su-certainly, Your Honor- 
ship.” 

As they left the room, Gervase 
picked the Florea Semper Fidelis 
Gun off the desk. It was too val- 
uable a piece of property to leave 
lying around. The Palace was 
full of sticky-fingered civil serv- 
ants.

They passed through room 
after room containing bank after 
bank of computing machines, 
each more complicated in ap- 
pearance than the last. Hordes of 
officials in the garb of hereditary 
scientist or technician bowed low 
as the new Ruler passed. The ^ 
machines, of course, operated 
and repaired themselves auto- 
matically; nonetheless, they 
needed a good many attendants 
as befitted their exalted status. 

Gervase and his guide finally 
came to the room where the 
Prognosticator itself was en- 
shrined. The apartment was 
twenty stories high and a hun- 
dred meters wide, but it was none 
too large for all the flashing lights 
and spinning dials and buzzing 
relays and levers and cables 
which jammed it. The hundreds 
of first-rank scientists who wait- 
ed upon the Machine stopped 
their tasks of dusting and polish- 
ing to greet the new Usurper with 
deferent acclaim. 

“Leave me,” he ordered, ges- 
turing with the gun toward the 
door. “I would be alone with the 
Prognosticator.” 

“Certainly, Your Honorship. 
Certainly. Your wishes are our 
commands.” 

They backed out. 

“You, too,” Gervase told the 
secretary who had guided him. 

“Y-yes, Your Honorship.” The 
man skittered off. 



When they had all gone, Ger- 
vase approached a small, unob- 
trusive door marked Danger — 
No Admittance: Dust lay thick 
on the sill, for it was seldom 
opened. 

Gervase took a tiny, intricate 
piece of metal from his pocket 
and fitted it into the lock. Some- 
thing inside clicked. The door 
swung open. 

Beyond, a narrow flight of 
steps spiraled downward. Ger- 
vase descended them unhesitat- 
ingly until he came to another 
small door. This one was simply 
marked Private. He knocked on 
it. 

“Aah, go butter your earlobes!” 
a cracked voice called from with- 
in. “Can’t you read, you dumb 
cluck?” 

“It’s me, Gervase!” He pound- 
ed on the door with the butt of 
his gun. “Open up!” 

T he door swung open creakily. 

Through the gloom inside, 
there could be dimly seen an- 
tique furnishings in a poor state 
of preservation and a still more 
imperfect state of cleanliness. An 
outmodedly streamlined twenti- 
eth-century typewriting machine 
was set on a costly metal stand 
with one caster missing. The 
flaps of the table were open — 
one held a chipped teapot, th« 
other a dusty crystal ball and a 
dog-eared pack of Gypsy cards. 



MAN'S BEST FRIEND

Behind all this was a rare old 
psychoanalyst’s couch, ripped 
open here and there and showing 
the original stuffing. 

Reclining on the couch was an 
incredibly old woman wearing a 
quaint costume of a bygone era 
— long scarlet silk skirt, yellow 
blouse, great golden hoops swing- 
ing in her ears. She was sipping 
something out of a teacup, but it 
didn’t smell like tea, at least not 
like tea alone. The ancient reek 
of gin pervaded and overpow- 
ered the general mustiness. 

“Hello, son!” the old woman 
said, waving the cup at Gervase. 
“ ’Bout time you came to pay 
your old mother a visit.” She 
cackled. “I kind of thought some- 
thing like this would stir you 
up!” 

“1%/|’OTHER,” Gervase said re- 
proachfully, “you know 
you shouldn’t have done it.” 

“What did I do?” she asked, 
assuming a ludicrous posture of 
innocence. 

“You fixed the Prognostica- 
tions, that’s what you did. Al- 
though why you had to pick on 
me — 

“Aah, I got tired of supporting 
you! You’re a big boy — it’s about 
time you earned your own living. 
Besides, I thought it’d be a good 
idea to elect a sympathetic ad- 
ministration. Sympathetic to me, 
that is. Palace needs a new ven- 



tilating system. Air in here’s ter- 
rible. Smells as if something’d 
died and they were too stingy to 
give it a decent burial.” 

“But why didn’t you use the 
Prognosticator to get new venti- 
lation put in?” Gervase asked. 
“Seems to me you could have 
foretold everyone in the Palace 
would suffocate or something if 
it wasn’t done.” 

“They’d have got around it, 
same way you got around killing 
Kipp.” 

Gervase blushed. 

“You can’t fool me!” she cack- 
led gleefully. “I know everything 
that goes on around this place 
and a lot that doesn’t.” She 
reached over and tapped his knee. 
“But you’ll pay attention to the 
Prognosticator, boy. Don’t you 
try to weasel out of what it says 
by looking for double meanings. 
Time you Overlords learned that 
when the Prognosticator says 
something, it means it.” 

“Yes, Mother,” he said. 

“I’d hate to have to give or- 
ders to have my own boy dis- 
posed of. The last three disposals 
weren’t so bad, but sometimes 
those things can turn out real 
messy.” 

“Yes, Mother.” 

She drank gustily from her 
teacup. “Maybe blood is thicker 
than water . but not much.” 

“Yes, Mother.” 

“And why shouldn’t you listen 



110

to my Prognostications?” she de- 
manded irritably, slamming her 
teacup down on the table so hard 
that the typewriter skipped. 
“Just because they’re dolled up 
a little doesn’t mean they’re not 
true. Don’t I have a crystal ball? 
Don’t I have a Gypsy tarot pack? 
Don’t I have tea leaves — best tea 
money can buy, too?” 

“Yes, Mother.” 

“So?” She looked at him ex- 



pectantly. “What are you going 
to do?” 

Gervase took a deep breath 
and drew himself up. “I’m going 
to have the ventilating system 
attended to right away.” 

“That’s my boy,” she said 
fondly, draining another cup of 
tea and peering at the leaves. “I 
can see everything’s going to 
work out fine — just fine.

By THEODORE STURGEON 



Having already died once, he found himself 
more alive fhan ever before— so alive that 
it hurt far worse than the agony of dying! 



Y ancey, who once had 
been killed, lay very still, 
with his arm flung across 
the pillow, and watched the 
moonlight play with the color of 
Beverly’s hair. Her hair was 
spilled over his shoulder and 
chest, and her body pressed

against him, warm. He wondered 
if she was asleep. He wondered 
if she could sleep, with that 
moonswept riot of surf and wind 
going on outside the hotel. 

The waves blundered into the 
cliff below, hooting through the 
sea-carved boulders, frightening 



112

great silver ghosts of spray out 
and up into the tom and noisy 
air. He wondered if she could 
sleep with her gentle face so near 
his thumping heart. He wished 
the heart would quiet itself — 
subside, at least, to the level of 
the storm outside, so that she 
might mistake it for the same 
storm. He wished he could sleep. 
For two years, he had been glad 
he did not sleep. Now he wished 
he could; it might quiet his heart. 

Beverly, Beverly, he cried si- 
lently, you don’t deserve this! 

He wished the bed were larger, 
so that he might ease away from 
her and be but thunder in a can- 
nonade, merging into the hiss 
and smash and ugly grumble of 
the sea. 

In the other bed, Lois shifted 
restlessly under the crisp sheet. 
Yancey looked at her without 
turning his head. 

T OIS was a thing of long lines 
under the dim white, her face 
and hair two kinds of darkness 
on the pillow. She was lean and 
somber. 

Beverly was happy and open 
and moved about like the bounc- 
ing ball which used to lead the 
singing at theaters, leaping along 
the lyrics. 

Lois walked as if she did not 
quite touch the floor, and the 
tones of her voice were like the 
tones of her skin and the clothes 



she favored — dark and smooth. 
Her eyes were long and secret 
and her face was a floe. Her nos- 
trils and the corners of her mouth 
and sometimes the slightest con- 
certed movement of a shoulder 
and an eyebrow hinted at a heat 
submerged and a strength re- 
laxed and aware, not asleep, not 
a sleep. Lois ... a synthesis of 
subtleties, of mysteries, delicate 
scents and soft puzzling laughter. 

She moved again. He knew 
that she, too, was staring tensely 
up into the mottled darkness. 
The spume-flecked moonlight 
was intolerant of detail, but Yan- 
cey had memorized her face. He 
knew of the compression of her 
lips, and that the corners of her 
mouth were softly turned despite 
the tension. He was deeply trou- 
bled by the sound of the sheet as 
she moved, for if he could hear 
that over the storm, how could 
Beverly miss the throb of his 
heart? 

Then he all but smiled. Of 
course Beverly did not hear as he 
did, nor see, nor feel, nor think 
with all her mind. Poor Beverly, 
poor, bright, sweet and faithful, 
more wife than woman; how can 
you compete with one who is 
more woman than . anyone? 

Better, this was better than the 
fearful joy that was like rage. His 
heart began to obey him, and he 
turned his cheek slightly to touch 
her hair. Pity, he thought, is a 



1T4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sharing sort of thing — you can 
feel the helplessness of the un- 
armed, whereas rage, like pas- 
sion, stands apart from its object 
and is lonesome. 

He settled himself now, and 
without moving he went limp in 
the thundering night, giving him- 
self up to the glimmer and shift 
of his thoughts. More than any- 
one else on Earth, he was sure, he 
enjoyed being alive, and his per- 
petual delight was in being alive 
altogether, awake and aware, 
conscious of his body and how 
it lay, and where, and at the same 
time afloat like a gull on the wind 
of his thought, yielding, con- 
trolled. 

Perhaps he enjoyed the dark 
part of his unending day the 
most, camouflaged by a coverlet 
and the closing of eyes. In the 
day, he lived with that which he 
commanded and that which, if 
he wished, he could command: 
at night, he lived with that which 
he did command. He could call 
a symphony to heel and make a 
syllogism stand and wait. He 
could cut a stack of places, fan 
a hand of faces, choose his pleas- 
ure of them and discard the rest. 

His recall was pinpoint-perfect, 
back and back to the point where 
he had been dead; before that, 
only excellent. He used it now as 
a measure against his heart’s re- 
bellion, so that Beverly could 
sleep, and, sleeping, not know. 



And because the idea of Lois, 
here, was unbearable, he let his 
mind take him back to Lois when 
she was only a secret. She had 
been an explosion within him, a 
pressure and a kind of guilt; but 
all the things she had been were 
things he could contain, and no 
one knew. So back he went, to his 
renascence; back through the 
time he had been dead, and still 
farther to Lois-first-seen, to a 
time when a man with a job and 
a wife and a settled gray life 
found this special astonishment. 

T here was a lake, and small 
cheap cabins crouched in a 
row to sip its shores. There was 
a “lodge” with its stilted fore- 
feet in the water and its rump on 
a hillside. There were boats and 
a float, a splintery dance floor 
and a bar which purveyed bev- 
erages all the way up to beer. 

Yancey, with little money and 
only two weeks vacation, had 
rented a cottage here sight un- 
seen. He expected little of it, be- 
ing resigned to the truism that a 
change of surroundings consti- 
tutes a vacation all by itself. He 
expected little of anything in 
those days. His life had reached 
a plateau — a long, narrow, slight- 
ly down-graded plateau where 
the horizons were close and the 
going easy. His job was safe and, 
by the chemistry of paternalism, 
would increase in value as it

aged, for all a large business re- 
quires of the bulk of its em- 
ployees is that they stay. 

He had been married for seven 
years to the blithe and patient 
Beverly, who was content with 
him. There had been a time when 
they interrupted one another in 
the rush to share themselves, and 
a longer time when there seemed 
very little to say, which made 
them both vaguely unhappy, and 
they lived with a mild and in- 
expressible sense of loss. And at 
last they discovered that coded 
communication devised by most 
folk 'with their unexciting famil- 
iars : small-talk, half-finished 

sentences, faint interrogative and 
exclamatory sounds, and present 
(as opposed to absent) silences. 

Life for Yancey and his wife 
was not dull — it was too un- 
planned for that — but its pulse 
beat between comfortable limits. 

This unplanned quality — ^why 
make plans when life is basically 
so certain? — was responsible for 
their late arrival at the lake. Last 
year’s map did not include the 
dozens of roads closed by the 
Thruway: somehow Yancey had 
never gotten around to having 
the spare fixed, so naturally they 
had a flat; then they had to drive 
back for the checkbook Yancey 
had forgotten, and of course it 
rained. It had rained all the pre- 
vious night and all day, and 
when they turned into the lake 



road, it was past eleven at night 
and still raining. 

They pulled up beside the 
lodge, where a glistening faded 
sign proclaimed OFFICE, and 
Yancey turned up his jacket col- 
lar and plunged out into the rain 
and floundered up the wooden 
steps. When there was no answer 
to his knock, he noticed a soggy 
pasteboard stuck between the 
doorframe and a loose pane. He 
tried to read it and could not. 

He went to the head of the 
steps and called, “Bev! Turn the 
spotlight up here!” 

B everly, between the loose- 
valved clacking of the motor 
and the drumming of rain on the 
car roof, heard a voice but no 
words. She turned off the ignition 
and rolled the window down. 
“What?” 

“The light. Spotlight. Shine 
it up here.” 

She did and Yancey went back 
to the door and crouched before 
the card. In a moment, he came 
back to the car and slid in, drip- 
ping. 

“They’re all in bed,” he said. 
“Cabin 14.” 

“Which one is our cabin?” 

“I don’t know. They only con- 
firmed the reservation. We’ll have 
to wake them up.” He pressed 
the starter. 

And pressed it, and pressed it. 
When the starter would deliver

nothing but a click and a grunt, 
Yancey leaned back and blew 
sharply through his nostrils. 
“Wires wet, I guess.” 

“What are we going to do?” 
“Walk. Or sit here.” 

She touched his sodden shoul- 
der and shuddered. “It can’t be 
too far. We’ll have to take a bag.” 
“Okay. Which one?” 

She considered. “I guess the 
brown one. It has my robe in it, 

I remember ... I think.” 

He knelt on the seat and 
reached into the back, found and 
fumbled the brown suitcase out. 
“Better turn off the lights. Igni- 
tion, too.” 

“The ignition is off,” Beverly 
said, trying it. 

"Whatr 

“When you were on the porch. 

I couldn’t hear you, so I turned 
it off.” 

The advantage of that status 
between married folk which com- 
municates by grunts and silences 
is that scorn, as well as content- 
ment, can be expressed with little 
effort. Yancey was simply and 
completely silent, and she said, 
“Oh, dear.” Then, defensively, 
“How was I supposed to know 
you didn’t turn it back on?” 
Yancey merely snorted. Bev- 
erly huddled in the seat. “Now 
it’s all my fault,” she muttered. 
More than a statement of fact, it 
meant in addition that any dis- 
comfort from this point on would 



be laid to her, and would also be 
attached to the day’s previous 
delays and exasperations, making 
her culpable in every way for 
everything. 

Yancey maintained his silence. 
Anything he might say would 
militate in her favor. To say one 
thing would forgive her, another 
would give her some ground for 
defense or counterattack. There 
was no real vindictiveness in his 
silence. He did not care whether 
or not she accepted the guilt as 
long as it was clear that guilt was 
not his. To put it another way, 
married familiars in this stage, 
though not necessarily enemies, 
have little friendship. 

T hey left the car by their re- 
spective doors, and the rain 
immediately increased as if it 
had been cued from the wings. 
The sporadic wind died com- 
pletely and suddenly and water 
seemed to displace air alto- 
gether. It ran down Yancey’s 
spine, it bashed at his eyelids, it 
threw gouts of mud up to his 
knees. 

He felt his way along the fend- 
er and around the front of the 
car until he collided with Bev- 
erly. They clung together, gasp- 
ing and waiting for some kind of 
light to penetrate the hissing del- 
uge. Some did, at last, a sodden 
sky- glow with a dimmer echo 
from the lake, and they began to

wade up the shore along the line 
of cabins. 

Visitors to the lake have been 
known to complain that the cab- 
ins were built too close together. 
It is clear that such plaintiffs 
never walked the row in the 
seething black of a summer rain. 
Each cabin boasted a wooden 
post with a number, cut from 
plywood with a jigsaw, perched 
on it. These could be read by 
water-wrinkled fingertips and 
they seemed to be fully half a 
mile apart. 

Yancey and Beverly did not 
attempt to talk; the only speech 
between them was a muttered 
number when occasionally they 
investigated one of the posts to 
check their progress. It was 
enough to make exasperation it- 
self turn numb, not to be re- 
awakened until they found cabin 

12, bypassed the next and turned 
in at what should therefore be 
14, only to find it called 15. 

“Fifteen, fifteen!” Beverly 
wailed wetly. “Where’s fourteen? 
It’s gone!” 

“Gone, hell,” growled Yancey, 
uselessly wiping at the water 
streaming over his mouth. 
“That’s it there, the one we just 
passed. Afraid to number a cabin 

13. Superstition. Oh, well. You 
know a woman runs this place,” 
he added. 

Beverly inhaled, a sharp gasp 
at this injustice, but took in as 



much water as air and could only 
cough. They backtracked and 
fumbled their way up to the dark 
bulk of Cabin 14. Yancey 
dropped the suitcase noisily on 
the small porch. 

“Yance! You’ll wake every- 
body up!” 

He looked at her and sighed. 
The sigh transmitted, “What did 
we come here for?” 

He pounded on the door and 
they pressed close to it, trying to 
get some shelter from the deco- 
rative gable over the door. A 
light showed, the doorknob 
moved, and they stepped back 
into the rain. 

And nothing, nothing at all 
told Yancey that, in this second, 
a line fell across his life, so that 
forever his biography would con- 
sist of the parts life-before-Lois 
and life-since-Lois, with nothing 
between them but a sheet of rain 
and a door that opened alto- 
gether, fearlessly. 

TTE said, “I’m Yance Bowman, 
this is my wife, and we — ” 
And then he saw her face and his 
voice failed him. 

Quickly, effortlessly Lois spoke 
into his sudden silence and made 
it unnoticeable. “Come in, come 
in!” And with one swift, bal- 
anced movement, she had taken 
the suitcase from his hand, 
whirled around them to reach out 
in the rain for the doorknob and.

in closing the door, swept them 
in. 

They stood panting and drip- 
ping, looking at her. She wore a 
maroon hostess robe with a col- 
lar that stood up like an Eliza- 
bethan ruff ; the material draped 
from her wide, flat shoulders 
with the static fluidity of a wa- 
terfall, all movement even while 
she was still. Her slight turn and 
bend as she set down the suitcase 
told him that those wide shoul- 
ders were indeed shoulders and 
not padding, and the unself-con- 
sciously bare feet declared that 
here was a woman who would 
stand and look straight into his 
eyes. 

Beverly spoke, or began to; he 
turned to her and saw that she 
was, by comparison, dumpy and 
wet and exceedingly familiar. 
“We didn’t know which cabin 
to — ’’ 

“Never mind that,” said Lois. 
“We’ll have two weeks to ex- 
plain ourselves to each other. 
First of all, you’ve just got to get 
out of those wet things, both of 
you. I’ll heat some coffee.” 

“But-but-but we can’t—” 

“But you can,” said Lois. “Not 
another word. Go on,” she said, 
crowding them into the hall 
which led away to the left. 
“There’s the bath. Take a show- 
er. A hot shower.” Without paus- 
ing, she scooped thick towels 
from a shelf and dropped them 



into Beverly’s hands. She reached 
past them and turned on the 
bathroom light. “I’ll get your 
bag.” 

She was gone and back before 
Beverly could get her mouth 
around another syllable. “Hurry 
now, before the muffins get cold.” 
“Muffins?” Beverly squeaked. 
“Oh, now^ please don’t go to that 
tr — ” But she was in the bath- 
room with Yancey, with the door 
closed, and Lois’s swift, light 
footsteps answering her like a 
laugh as they went down the hall. 

“Well, I — ” said Beverly. 
“Yancey, what can we do?” 

“Like the lady says, I guess.” 
He gestured. “You first.” 

“A shower? Oh, I couldn’tl" 
He pulled her over in front of 
the basin and aimed her face at 
the mirror. “Wouldn’t hurt.” 

“I’m a sightl” She had one 
more second of hesitation, mur- 
mured, “Well . .” and then 
pulled her soaking dress off over 
her head. 

Yancey undressed slowly while 
Beverly splashed under the 
shower. About the time the mir- 
ror was thoroughly steamed up, 
she began to hum, high and 
happy. 

Yancey’s numbed brain kept 
recreating the vision of Lois as 
he had first seen her, framed in 
lamplight, which was in turn 
framed by a hurtling silver halo 
of rain. His mind formed it and

I and again retreated. It would

I doubted, at the moment, that it

Y ANCEY’S only analytical 
thought came as an academic 
question, not to be answered by 
any process he then knew : How 
could a woman be so decisive, 
so swift, yet so extraordinarily 
quiet? Her voice had come to him

“All right.” She put a par-

bing briskly as she emerged. “I 
! feel as if we’d been kidnapped,

and soaped up. The scalding wa-

, far and away the best shower he 
had ever taken — up to the point 
when Beverly uttered a soft and 
tragic wail. 

j “What have you done now?” 



he inquired, his voice carrying a 
labored patience. He turned off 
the shower and peered through 
the mists at his wife. 

She had a towel around her 
head like a turban and her pale 
blue chenille beach robe was 
thrown over her shoulders. “The 
black one,” she said. 

“Give me a towel. What black 
what?” 

“Suitcase. This is all the beach 
things. There isn’t a thing of 
yours here but your bathing 
trunks.” 

“This,” he said after a suitable 
silence, “is just your night.” 

“Oh, Yance, I’m sorry.” 

“I’m sorry, too.” He stared 
fixedly at her until she wilted. 
“I’ll just get back into those wet 
clothes.” 

“You can’t!” 

“Got a better idea? I’m not go- 
ing out there in bathing trunks.” 
There was a knock on the 
door. “Soup’s on!” 

Before he could stop her, Bev- 
erly called out with a distressed 
bleat, “Know what I did? I 
brought the wrong suitcase! 
There’s nothing here for my 
husband to wear but his bathing 
suit!” 

“Good,” said the soft voice on 
the other side of the door. “Put it 
on and come on out. The cof- 
fee’s poured.” When they did not 
respond, Lois laughed gently. 
“Did you people come to the lake 



HURRICANE TRIO 



121 



to be formal? Didn’t you expect 
to be seen in bathing suits? Come 
on,” she insisted, with such 
warmth that, in spite of them- 
selves, they found some sheepish 
smiles and put them on. 

“Coming,” said Yancey. He 
took the trunks out of the open 
suitcase. 

In the living room, a fire had 
been lit and was just beginning 
to gnaw on the kindling and 
warm a log. A table was set, sim- 
ply and most attractively — gray 
place mats, black cups, wrought- 
iron candlesticks with black can- 
dles. There was a steaming glass 
urn and an electric toaster which 
clucked once and popped up two 
halves of an English muffin just 
as they sat down. 

Lois came out of the kitchen 
carrying a black sugar bowl. She 
glided up behind them as they 
sat at the table, leaned over them. 
One long arm put the bowl down ; 
her other hand touched Yancey’s 
bare shoulder. 

Something — 

Something happened. 

TN the other bed, Lois abruptly 
* turned on her side, facing 
him. She reached over to the 
night table between the beds, 
found a cigarette. The wind died 
just then, taking a deep quiet 
breath for the next shriek, and 
in the jolting silence, a great sea 
smashed the cliff below. Lois 



struck her match, and the light 
and the explosion of water to- 
gether plucked Yancey’s nerves 
in a single shattering chord. He 
steeled himself and did not start. 

In the blinding flare of the 
match, Lois’s face seemed to leap 
at him — a partial mask, centered 
on the arch of an eyebrow, the 
smooth forehead over it, the fore- 
head’s miniature counterpart in 
the smooth lowered lid itself. The 
arches were stable, flawless, 
things on which could be built a 
strong and lovely structure if one 
could only . only . 

He lost the thought in the bal- 
looning glow of her cigarette as 
she lay back and puffed quickly 
— too quickly for her to enjoy it, 
surely. She drew the glow into a 
ruddy yellow sharp-tipped cone 
and the smoke must have been 
hot and harsh to taste. Hot and 
harsh. 

He moistened his lips. 

A surge of anger began to rise 
within him, matching again the 
sea outside. With an approaching 
breaker, the anger mounted and 
swelled and exploded. But the 
breaker could turn to foam and 
mist, and disperse, and he could 
do nothing but clench his teeth 
and press his head back into the 
pillow, for he must not wake 
Beverly. 

This was so unjust! Beverly 
gave him everything he wanted. 
She always had, especially since 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that- time at the lake. Especially 
since ... 

Her capacity for giving amazed 
him, almost awed him. She gave 
with everything she did. Her 
singing was an outpouring. She 
laughed with all her heart. Her 
sympathy was quick and com- 
plete. She gave constantly, to 
him more than to anyone or any- 
thing else on Earth. They had — 
now — a marriage that was as 
good as a marriage could be. 
How, then, could there be room 
in him for this — this thing, this 
acute, compelling awareness of 
Lois? Why must there be this 
terrible difference between 
“want” and “need”? He didn’t 
need Lois! 

The anger subsided. He bent 
his arm and touched Beverly’s 
hair. She moved, turning her 
head from side to side, burrow- 
ing closer in to his shoulder. This 
won’t do, he thought desperately. 
Am I not the boy with the Brain 
— the man who can’t be pushed 
around — who is never puzzled by 
anything? 

G O back, Yancey. Go back 
again to where your world 
was full of Lois and you could 
control it. If you could do it 
then, with a tenth of the mind 
you have now, then why . why 
can’t you . why is your heart 
trying to break your ribs? 

He closed his eyes against the 



shouting silver of the night and 
the bloom of Lois’s cigarette. 
Back, he demanded, go back 
again. Not to the hand on the 
shoulder. Afterward. The rain 
letting up, and the scurrying 
through the puddles and the sky- 
drip to their own cabin, the one 
next door. Hold it. Hold it right 
there ... 

Ah. He had it again; he was 
back two years, feeling again 
what it was like to be able to 
keep Lois to himself, and his 
heartbeat normal. 

Impossible! But he had done 
it, for almost two whole weeks. 
Lois on the diving platform, then 
painted on the sky, forever air- 
borne — forever, because aware- 
ness such as his photographed 
and filled the vision in his mem- 
ory, she hung there still against 
a cloud. And the square dance, 
with the fiddle scratching away 
into an overloaded P.A. system 
and feet clumping against the 
boards, and the hoarse, happy 
shouter: “Alamen lef an’ around 
we go, swing yore potner do-si- 
do .. now swing somebody else 
. an’ somebody else . an’ 
somebody ELSE . .” 

And ELSE had been Lois, 
turning exactly with him, light 
and mobile in his arms, here and 
gone before he knew completely 
she was there, leaving him with 
a clot in his throat and a strange 
feeling in his right hand, where 



HURRICANE TRIO 



123 



it had taken the small of her 
back. It seemed not to belong 
completely to him any more, as 
if her molecules and his had in- 
terpenetrated. 

Oh, and Lois breaking up a 
fight between one of the summer 
people and a town man, drifting 
close, ruffling the hair of one 
and laughing, being a presence 
about whom no violence could 
take place. Lois backing the sta- 
tion-wagon skillfully among the 
twisting colonnades of a birch 
grove . 

And Lois doing unremarkable 
things unforgettably — a way of 
holding her fork, lifting her head, 
ceasing to breathe while she lis- 
tened for something. Lois glimps- 
ed through the office window, 
smiling to herself. Lois reading 
the announcements at lunch, her 
voice just loud enough for some- 
one else sharing, say, a porch 
swing with her, yet audible to 
eighty people. 

Lois, for that matter, walking, 
standing, writing, making a 
phone call . 

Lois alive on this Earth — ^that 
was enough to remember. 

Nearly two weeks of this, wak- 
ing with Beverly, breakfasting, 
swimming, boating, hiking with 
Beverly, and his preoccupation 
cloaked in the phlegmatic com- 
munications of familiarity. 

What difference did it make if 
his silence was a rereading of 



Lois’s face instead of a reconsid- 
eration of the sports page? He’d 
attempt to share neither with 
Beverly; what then was the dif- 
ference? Earlier in their marriage, 
she might have complained that 
it was useless to have a vacation 
if he acted just the same during 
it as he did at home. At this 
stage, however, he was complete- 
ly — one might say invisibly — 
Yancey. Just Yancey, like al- 
ways. 

H e might have kept it up 
indefinitely, except for a cer- 
tain natural limitation on oppos- 
ing forces. Such a limitation may 
be seen at work in a vessel of 
water with a cork floating in it. 
You may weight the cork with 
grains of lead until it sinks; you 
may remove grains until it floats 
again. But you may not remove 
exactly enough lead so that the 
cork will suspend itself like Ma- 
homet’s tomb. If it does not float, 
it will sink. If it does not sink, it 
will float. The line of demarca- 
tion between buoyant and not- 
buoyant is a definite one, but so 
fine that it may be found only 
by passing it. 

There was such a line between 
possible and not-possible in 
Yancey’s ability to contain his 
feelings about Lois. He did not 
know just where it was or what 
would make him cross it; but 
cross it he did, and there was no 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mistaking it once it happened. 

It was a Thursday (they were 
to leave on Sunday) and, in the 
afternoon, Yancey had asked 
Lois to come to their cabin that 
evening. He blurted it out; the 
words hung between them and he 
stared at them, amazed. Perhaps, 
he thought, he was being face- 
tious . and then Lois gravely 
accepted, and he fled. 

He had to tell Beverly, of 
course, and he didn’t know how 
and he made up, in advance, 
seven different ways to handle 
her in anticipation of the seven 
ways in which she might react. 
Naturally, each would result in 
Lois’s coming. Exactly what the 
evening would be like, he could 
not predict, which was strange 
in a man who was so ready with 
alternatives when it came to 
making a hostess out of Beverly. 

“Bev,” he said abruptly when 
he found her pitching horseshoes 
back of the lodge, “Lois is com- 
ing for a drink after dinner.” 

Beverly tossed a horseshoe, 
watched it land, skip and fall, 
then turned to him. Her eyes 
were wide — well, they always 
were — and their shining surfaces 
reminded him, in that moment, 
of the reflecting side of a one-way 
mirror. What would she say? 
And which of the seven ripostes 
must he use to overcome her re- 
sistance? Or would he have to 
make up an eighth on the spur 



of the moment? He waited. 

She bent down and picked up 
another horseshoe and said, 
“What time?” 

So Lois came. Her light, firm 
knock might just as well have 
been on the base of his tongue, 
so immediately did he feel it. If, 
later on, his will failed him a 
little, it was because now he sat 
still using it up, and let Beverly 
go to the door. 

B everly, he thought, for her 
own sake, should not permit 
herself to be in the same room 
with Lois. Lois came in and filled 
the room, but without crowding. 
Lois went back and down into a 
chair as if carried by flying 
things. Lois’s body grew up out 
of the cushions, supported by 
what she breathed, like an under- 
water plant. And Beverly bounc- 
ed about with glasses and ice and 
talked . talked. What Lois 
did was something different; Lois 
conversed. 

He sat dully, contributing lit- 
tle, watching, thinking his own 
thoughts. He was achingly aware 
of many things, but foremost was 
the realization that Lois was 
making an effort — a completely 
’ successful one, as far as he could 
judge — to put Beverly at her 
ease. She made no such effort 
for him, and he told himself with 
pride that this was because she 
had no need to; they understood 



HURRICANE TRIO 



125 



one another and must make 
things easy for poor Beverly. 

He lay back almost drowsily, 
soaking in Lois’s presence as if 
she were the Sun and from her 
he was gradually acquiring a 
sort of tan. 

Then they were alone in the 
room, when Beverly went to the 
kitchen, and then Beverly was 
wailing something about ice — oh, 
dear, but the Johnsons in Nine 
will have some; no, don’t bother. 
I’ll be right back — ^the screen 
door in the kitchen slammed and 
Beverly’s quick feet went bam- 
bam-bam down the back steps, 
and ceased to exist as they en- 
countered pine-needles; all this 
in a brace of moments, and he 
was alone with Lois. 

He rose and went to the couch 
and sat where its corner touched 
the arm of the chair. It seemed 
to take all the energy he had; 
he wanted a cigarette, he wanted 
to speak. He could do nothing. 

After a silent time, he felt 
Lois’s gaze on him. He turned to 
her quickly and she looked down. 
He was glad because their heads 
were so close, and he had never 
examined her this way, slowly. 

He wet his lips and said, “Only 
ten days.” 

She made an interrogative syl- 
lable. 

“Knowing you.” He rose sud- 
denly and crossed in front of her. 
He put one knee on the broad 



arm of her chair and sat back 
on his heel, his other foot steady- 
ing him on the floor. She stayed 
just as she was, looking down at 
her long brown hands. “I want 
to tell you something, Lois.” 

A small frown appeared and 
disappeared on her smooth fore- 
head. She did not raise her eyes. 

“It’s something I’ve never told 
even to . never told anyone.” 

T OIS moved a little. She did 
not raise her face, but now 
he had a three-quarter view of 
her profile. She waited, still as 
a held breath. 

“The night when we arrived,” 
he said. “You made coffee and 
I sat at the table. You came up 
behind me to put something 
down. You touched me.” 

He closed his eyes and put his 
arm across his chest and his 
hand high on his shoulder. 
“Something . happened,” he 
said, with an unaccountable dif- 
ficulty. 

Yancey was, in a small way, an 
engineer. He began abruptly to 
explain with painful pedantry, 
“It wasn’t static electricity. It 
couldn’t have been because it 
was pouring outside and the air 
was humid, not dry. You were 
on the bare floor in your bare 
feet, so it wasn’t one of those 
deep-pile rug phenomena. It 
wasn’t anything . .” he opened 
his eyes, swallowed . “static. 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



or anything like that,” he man- 
aged. Then he was quiet, watch- 
ing her. 

Her face, the flexible mask, 
was breaking up like an ice-floe 
in a sudden warm, strong current. 
Her brow was like a snowbank 
with the marks of a kitten’s claws 
on it. There was a tear on her left 
cheek and the streak of one on 
her right, and her teeth were 
driving into her lower lip. The 
corners of her mouth were turned 
upward, precisely as they would 
be in a smile, and there was a deli- 
cate pucker in the flesh of her 
chin. She made not a sound. She 
rose, her eyes seizing his and 
holding them as she backed to 
the door. There she turned and 
ran out into the dark. 

When Beverly came back, he 
was still half-crouched, balanc- 
ing on the arm of the chair. 
“Why, where’s Lois?” 

“She left,” he said heavily. 

Beverly looked at him. She 
looked at his eyes, quickly at his 
hairline, his mouth, and again 
at his eyes. Then she went into 
the kitchen and he heard the ice 
she was carrying fall explosively 
into the sink. 

She called out, “Is anything 
the matter, Yancey?” 

“Nothing’s the matter,” he said, 
getting up. 

They cleared up the glasses 
and ashtrays and went to bed. 
Lois was not mentioned. Nothing 



was mentioned. They went about 
the ritual of retiring in silence. 

When the lights were out, he 
said, “I’ve had enough of this 
place. Let’s go home in the morn- 
ing. Early.” 

She was quiet for a long time. 
Then she said, “If you want to.” 
He thought she slept badly. 
He did not sleep at all. 

I N THE morning, he drove furi- 
ously. For the first twenty 
miles, he could not understand 
what he felt; then he began to 
understand that it was anger. For 
another fifty miles, he could find 
no direction for the anger; none 
of the people involved had, after 
all, done anything, so how could 
there be anger? 

Occasionally he glanced at 
Beverly. She ordinarily sat back, 
looking forward at the sky, side- 
ways to scenery, or inward to 
whatever it was she communed 
with during those silent times 
they spent together. This morn- 
ing, however, she sat straight and 
kept her eyes on the road ahead, 
which made him aware that he 
was driving too fast and annoyed 
him beyond description. Child- 
ishly, he increased both his speed 
and his anger. 

And at last, with a feeling that 
approached relief, he found 
something to be angry at. 
Beverly. 

Why wouldn’t she say, “Slow

down!” Why had she agreed to 
let Lois come to their cabin? 
Why had she gone on blandly 
being herself this whole time, 
while he was tearing himself 
apart inside? Why hadn’t she 
even questioned him when he 
decided so abruptly to leave? 
“If you want to,” she’d said. 
“If you want to.” What kind of 
self-respect was that? 

Or maybe she just didn’t care. 

If you want to .. 

For the very first time in seven 
years, he realized that this was 
her code, her basic philosophy of 
life. They had red drapes in the 
living room. They had always 
had red drapes in the living 
room. Well, he liked red drapes. 
He’d said so and she had put up 
red drapes. 

He glanced at her. She was 
watching the road tautly. He 
squeezed down a bit more on the 
accelerator. 

The place they lived in, the job 
he kept, the food they ate and 
probably the clothes she wore — 
were they really chosen because 
they were what he wanted? 

Were they what he wanted? 

Should he have what he want- 
ed? 

Why not? Beverly had. 

He laughed, making Beverly 
start violently. He shook his head 
at her, which meant either “I 
won’t tell you” or “Mind your 
own business.” He had disquali- 



fied himself from finding any flaw 
in this new and breathtaking con- 
clusion and it made him exult- 
ant. He enjoyed speed in his 
exultation, and control. 

He sent the car howling 
through a deep cut in the crest of 
a hill, and around the blind turn 
on the other side, which was 
where he collided with the space- 
ship and was killed. 

A S IT WILL at times in the 
wake of a hurricane, the 
wind died. Less tractable, the 
sea punished the cliff unabated. 
The night was as noisy, but the 
the noise was so different that 
it was as shocking as sudden 
silence. In it, Lois angrily ram- 
med her cigarette into the ash- 
tray on the night table. She turn- 
ed her back and then sighed. The 
sound was only half vocalized, 
but such a voice propagates more 
like light than like sound. 

Beverly came hurtling up out 
of slumber and flashed free like 
a leaping fish, only to fall back 
and swirl near the under-surfaces 
of sleep. She raised her head, 
turning it as if seeking, but her 
eyes were closed. 

“Hm?” she said sleepily. Then 
her face dropped to Yancey’s 
chest again and she was still. 

What I should do, thought 
Yancey wildly, is to sit her up 
and slap her awake and say, 
Look, Bev, you know what? I

got killed that morning when we 
had the accident, I was dead al- 
together, the late Yancey Bow- 
man, R.I.P., and when they put 
me back together, I was different. 
For two years now, you’ve been 
living with a man with a mind 
that never sleeps and never 
makes mistakes and does . 
can do . anything it wants. So 
you can’t expect ordinary con- 
duct from me, Bev, or rational 
behavior based on any reasoning 
you can understand. So if I do 
anything that . that hurts you, 
you mustn’t be hurt. Can’t you 
understand that? 

Of course she wouldn’t under- 
stand. 

Why, he thought desperately, 
when they put me back together, 
didn’t they iron out that little 
human wrinkle which made it 
possible for Pascal to make that 
remark about the heart having 
“reasons which reason does not 
know”? 

He snorted softly. Heart. Hell 
of a name for it. 

He lay on his back and watch- 
ed the misty motion of surf-sCat- 
tered moon on the ceiling. He let 
his mind float into the vague 
shadows, be one with them away 
from, above, beyond his insup- 
portable, insoluble problem. And 
gradually he found himself back 
there again, two years ago — per- 
haps because of the momentum 
of his previous thinking, perhaps 



because, in reliving a time when 
there was Lois (and he could 
stand it) and a time when there 
was Lois (and he could not), 
it was a welcome thing to go into 
a time where Lois and Beverly 
and, for that matter, Yancey 
Bowman had little significance. 

W HEN THE spaceship lifted, 
it retracted its berthing- 
feet; it was one of these that the 
Bowman sedan struck. The car 
continued under the ship, and the 
edge of the flat berthing-foot slic- 
ed it down to the beltline, leaving 
a carmine horror holding the 
wheel. 

The ship hovered momentarily, 
then drifted over to the side of 
the road where the mangled au- 
tomobile had come to rest. Di- 
rectly above the car, it stopped. 
An opening appeared in the bot- 
tom of the ship and dilated like 
a camera iris. There was a slight 
swirl of dust and leaves, and then 
what was left of the car rose from 
the ground and disappeared into 
the ship. The ship then slid away 
to the clearing in the woods 
where it had lain hidden during 
its stay on Earth. Here it settled 
and concealed itself. 

Exactly what was done to him, 
Yancey, of course, could not 
know. He was made aware of 
the end results, naturally. He 
knew that what had been injured 
had been repaired and that, in 



HURRICANE TRIO

addition, certain changes had 
been made to improve the orig- 
inal. 

For example, his jaw-hinges 
had been redesigned to eliminate 
a tendency to dislocation. His 
vermiform appendix was gone — 
not excised, but removed in some 
way which would indicate, in the 
event of an autopsy, that it had 
never formed in the first place. 
His tonsils had been replaced 
for reasons he could not under- 
stand, except that they were good 
ones. 

And yet such anomalies as his 
left little toe, which since birth 
had been bent and lay diagonally 
across its neighbor, and a right 
eye which wandered slightly to 



the right when he was fatigued — 
these were left as they had orig- 
inally been. 

The eye was one of the most 
interesting items, he thought 
later; the toe had simply not 
been improved, but the eye had 
been restored with its flaw. His 
teeth, too, contained the same 
number of fillings and in the 
same places. 

In sum, he had been altered 
only in ways that would not 
show. 

He did know, however, why 
these things had been done. 
There was, inside that ship, an 
aura of sympathy mixed with 
remorse unlike anything he had 
ever felt. Another component was 



130 



respect; an all-embracing, almost 
worshipful respect for living 
things. 

Somewhere near where he lay 
in the ship’s laboratory was a 
small covered shelf, on which lay 
a cicada, two grasshoppers, four 
summer moths and an earth- 
worm, all casualties in his acci- 
dent. Their cell structure, organic 
functions, digestive and repro- 
ductive processes were under 
study as meticulous as that which 
was being lavished on him. For 
them, restitution was to be made 
also, and they would be released 
in as good condition as this un- 
thinkably advanced science could 
make them. The improvements 
seemed to be in the nature of a 
bonus, an implemented apology. 

And there was no denying that 
as long as such repayment was 
made, the alien footsteps on 
Earth were fairly obliterated. Yet 
Yancey was always certain that 
this last was not a primary mo- 
tive and that t|ie aliens, whoever 
they were, wherever they came 
from, would have sacrificed any- 
thing, themselves included, ra- 
ther than interfere with terrestrial 
and undoubtedly any other life. 

T hey had done the same 
things with his car as they 
had done with him. He had not 
the slightest question that, if they 
had wished, they could have re- 
built the old sedan into a gleam- 



ing miracle, capable of flight and 
operable forever on a teacup of 
fuel. He found it looking as it 
had always looked, even to rust- 
spots and a crinkling around the 
windshield where moisture had 
penetrated the laminations of the 
safety glass. Yet there was a little 
more pickup, a little more econ- 
omy; the brakes were no longer 
grabby in wet weather, and the 
cigarette lighter heated up in 
fewer seconds than it once did. 

Who were these aliens? Where 
had they come from? What were 
they doing here and what did 
they look like? 

He knew precisely as much as 
they permitted. He even knew 
why he knew as much as he did. 

They could restore his crushed 
head and shoulder, and did. 
They could make slight improve- 
ments, and did. But even they 
could not predict every situation 
in which he might find himself in 
the future. It was deeply import- 
ant to them, and it would be to 
him, to conceal the changes that 
had been made, or the reciprocal 
impacts between him and his 
society might deeply affect both. 

The best concealment would 
be his full knowledge of what had 
been done and a solemn injunc- 
tion to divulge nothing of it to 
anyone. That way he could never 
innocently perform public mir- 
acles and then be at a loss to ex- 
plain.

Most miraculous, of course, 
was the lowered impulse-resist- 
ance of his nervous system, in- 
cluding the total brain. He need 
no longer run over and over a 
thought sequence, like a wheel 
making a rut, to establish a syn- 
apse and therefore retain know- 
ledge. He had quickened physical 
reactions. He had total recall 
(from the time of his release from 
the ship) and complete access to 
his previous memory banks. 

Yet a prime directive among 
his “surgeons” seemed to have 
been a safeguarding of what his 
world called Yancey Bowman. 
Nothing — nothing at all — was 
done to change Yancey Bowman 
into something or someone else. 
He functioned a little better now, 
but he functioned as Yancey 
Bowman, just as the changes in 
his digestive system were basic- 
ally improvements rather than 
replacements. He could get more 
energy out of less food, even as 
he could breathe higher concen- 
trations of CO2 than he could 
before. Likewise, he could be, and 
was, Yancey Bowman more effi- 
ciently than ever before. 

Hence nothing was changed, 
even (or especially) the turmoil 
that was uppermost in his mind 
when he died. 

S O IT was that after death had 
struck on a Friday morning, 
the same morning hour on Sun- 



day revealed a strange sight — ^but 
only to some birds and a fright- 
ened chipmunk. Slipping out of 
Earth itself, the ship spread top- 
soil where it had lain, covered it 
with a little snow of early-fallen 
leaves, and shouldered into the 
sky. 

It wheeled and for a moment 
paralleled the deserted highway 
below. The opening on its belly 
appeared and down through the 
shining air swept an aging two- 
door sedan, its wheels spinning 
and its motor humming. When it 
touched the roadway, there was 
not so much as a puff of dust, 
so perfectly were wheels and for- 
ward motion synchonized. 

The car hurtled through a cut 
in a hilltop and around the blind 
turn on the other side and con- 
tinued on its way, with Yancey 
Bowman at the wheel, seething 
inwardly at the unreachable 
stupidities of his wife. 

And was there a moment of 
shock when he found himself 
alive and on his way unharmed, 
in his undamaged automobile? 
Did he turn and crane to see the 
dwindling speck in which his life 
had ended and begun again? Did 
he pull over to the side, mop his 
brow, and in a cascade of words 
exult over his new powers? Did 
Beverly demand to know what 
had happened, and would she 
not go out of her mind when she 
found that Friday was Sunday 



HURRICANE TRIO 



133 



now, and that for her there had 
been no Saturday this week? 

No, and no, and no. There was 
no shock, because he was certain 
to his marrow that this was the 
way it would be, that he would 
say nothing and that he must not 
look back. As for Beverly, her 
silence was proof enough that her 
convictions would suit the situa- 
tion as well. 

So he drove too fast and was 
too quiet, and his anger bubbled 
away until at length it concen- 
trated into something quieter and 
rather uglier. As it formed, he 
drove more sensibly, and Beverly 
relaxed and leaned back, turning 
now and again to inspect the 
shutters or the drapes in a house 
they passed, watching the sky 
up ahead while she thought her 
own thoughts. 

If you could call them 
thoughts, he reflected. 

The product of his anger was 
a cold projection and took the 
form of an unspoken dictum to 
Beverly. He found that, with his 
new reflexes, he could give the 
matter his full attention, since 
now his hands seemed quite able 
to drive by themselves and even, 
it appeared, to read route signs. 

So, echoing noiselessly in his 
mind, this structure builded : 

This is not the end, Beverly, 
because the end must have been 
long since. You are not a woman 
living her life; you are a half- 



person living mine. Your ambi- 
tion could not push me ahead, 
your senses could not know when 
I was in torture, your taste is not 
your own, and your abilities are 
limited to a dull search for what 
might please me and a trial-and- 
error effort to get it for me. But 
aside from me, you are nothing. 
You do not and you could not 
earn your own living. Cast out 
on your own resources, you could 
not so much as fill a receptionist’s 
chair or even run a summer re- 
sort. 

If nothing whatever had hap- 
pened to me during these three 
days, what we have could never 
be called ‘marriage’ again, not 
by me. I have looked into the 
Sun, Beverly; I have flown; I 
can never crawl the mud with 
you again. I was too much for 
you before. What then am I 
now? 

A ND SO it ran, turning and 
elaborating itself, but always 
returning to a silent, scornful 
chant, buoyed up by glimpses of 
freedom and far horizons. After 
about an hour of this, he sensed 
her gaze and turned to look at 
her. 

She met his eyes and smiled 
her old smile. “It’s going to be a 
lovely day, Yance.’’ 

He turned abruptly back to 
the road. Something in his throat 
demanded attention and he 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



found he could not swallow it. 
His eyes stung. He sat, unwilling- 
ly examining his feelings, and 
slowly it came to him that, 
among his other traits, the char- 
acteristic he had called empathy, 
the slipping on of other people s 
shoes, the world seen through 
the eyes of others — this quality, 
too, had suffered a sea-change. 

What, to Beverly, had happen- 
ed? Numbly, perhaps, she had 
been aware that something was 
amiss at the lake. He seriously 
doubted if she had identified the 
something. She’d known it was 
important — she had agreed to 
their leaving so abruptly without 
asking any questions. 

But what was this “lovely day” 
business? Did she think that be- 
cause their backs were turned 
to the unidentified threat, it had 
ceased to exist? Why, that must 
be exactly what she thought! 

Oh, Beverly, Beverly, are you 
going to get a kick in the teeth! 

But a day went by and no such 
thing happened. It didn’t happen 
the first week, either, or in a 
month. Part of this was because 
of his work. He went back to it 
with a new sense, an awareness. 
He became totally sensitive to a 
condition called ‘integration 
himself with his job, his job with 
his office, his office to the firm, 
and the firm itself in the economic 
mosaic. He wasted no motion in 
his job, and found himself spend- 



ing his working day in pondering 
the structure of his surroundings. 
His first new effort was expressed 
through the suggestion box. It 
was perfect of its kind. It was an 
idea simple enough to have been 
thought of by his pre-accident 
self, and unlikely to be advanced 
by anyone not in this particular 
job. It eliminated the job and 
Yancey was advanced two grades 
and given new work to do. So he 
was busy, immersed, engaged, 
even at home. That in itself was 
enough to submerge his feelings 
about Beverly. 

But it was only a part of his 
procrastination. (He called it 
that at first: sooner or later, he 
thought, there would be changes 
made.) Largely, he delayed be- 
cause of this accursed empathy. 
Beverly was so happy. She was 
happy and proud. If he became 
unaccountably silent, she tiptoed 
about the place, quite convinced 
that the great man was dreaming 
up something else for the sug- 
gestion box. If he was short-tem- 
pered, she forgave. If he bought 
her something, or okayed some- 
thing she had bought, she was 
grateful. Home was harmonious, 
Beverly was so happy she sang 
again. He realized that it had 
been a great while since she sang. 

And all the while he knew how 
she felt. He knew it surely and 
painfully, and was fully aware 
of the impact she must suffer if

he broached to her his inner 
thinking. He’d do it; oh, yes, he’d 
do it — some day. Meanwhile, it 
wouldn’t hurt anything if she got 
that new winter coat slje had 
eyed so wistfully in the Sunday 
paper. 

00 A YEAR went by and he 
did nothing about the matter. 

Actually, he thought less about 
it after a year, though there were 
moments . but work was more 
engrossing than ever and home 
was such a pleasure, though a 
quiet one, and Beverly was fairly 
blooming. If a man has the virtue 
(or the curse) of empathy, he 
has to be kind. He must, for the 
most selfish of reasons — any time 
he strikes out at another human, 
he will find bruises on himself. 

Once, suddenly, he asked her: 
“Beverly, have I changed?” 

She looked puzzled. 

“Since last year, I mean. Do 

1 seem different?” 

She thought about it. “I don’t 
know. You’re — nice. But you 
were always nice.” She laughed 
suddenly. “You can catch flies!” 
she teased. “Why do you ask, 
Yance?” 

“No reason. The new job and 
all.” He passed the reference to 
flies. One had been bothering her 
last fall and he had absently 
reached out and caught it on the 
wing. It was the only time he 
had come near betraying his new 



talents. She had been astonished; 
In the eight years she had known 
him, he had never demonstrated 
coordination like that. She would 
have been more astonished if 
she had noticed that he caught 
the fly between his thumb and 
forefinger. 

“The new job hasn’t gone to 
your head,” she said, “if that’s 
what you mean.” 

He maneuvered a situation in 
the office which required atten- 
tion in an out-of-town branch 
and arranged matters so that 
sending him out there was only 
logical. He was gone two weeks. 
He had seen to it that it was not 
the kind of task that required 
genius — just application and 
good detail work. He met two 
girls while he was there, a bril- 
liant one high in the company, 
and one far better than anything 
the company would ever be able 
to hire. He left them alone, dis- 
liking himself because he knew, 
in his heart of hearts, whom he 
was being faithful to. 

And it was good, good to get 
home. Due to what he had done 
out of town, he was raised an- 
other notch, but had to reorgan- 
ize his new office, so there was 
no vacation that year. He could 
easily have analyzed this devel- 
opment to see whether he had 
purposely avoided a vacation, but 
he did not. He preferred not to 
know.

There was a company picnic 
and Beverly sang. People reacted 
so enthusiastically — especially 
to Yancey, as if he had invented 
her — that he coaxed and goaded 
her into auditioning for a tele- 
vision show. She won the audi- 
tion and appeared. She lost the 
audience vote to an eight-year- 
old boy with an accordian, but 
she was incandescently happy be- 
cause Yancy had cared, Yancey 
had helped. 

TN YANCEY’S private code, 
that was the Year of the Big 
Christmas. They took a week off 
and went to a ski lodge in New 
Hampshire. They did a number 
of things together and nothing 
was wrong about any of it. And 
one night they sat before a 
Christmas-card kind of fireplace 
with a crowd of kindred souls, 
drinking glug and roaring carols, 
until they were too sleepy to 
move. 

After everyone else had gone 
to bed, they sat holding hands 
silently and watching the fire go 
out. As it will at such moments, 
his life whisked across his inner 
eye (this happens when one is 
living, not when one is dying) 
and stopped here at this hearth; 
and on it was superimposed the 
uneasy question What am I do- 
ing here? and over him came a 
flood of tenderness for Beverly, 
poor Beverly. 



For the first time, it occurred 
to him that this fantastic thing 
which had happened to him 
might have a grim and horrible 
result. His metabolic efficiency, 
his apparent immunity to every- 
thing from the common cold up, 
his outright inability to get too 
little rest or too little food . 
suppose he should live — well, not 
forever, but — 

He glanced at his wife, and 
though she was young-looking 
for her age, his quick mind vivid- 
ly supplied a wrinkle here and 
there a little sag. He would be 
able to conceal his feelings about 
it, of course, but would she? 
Empathetically, he lived through 
a brief torture with her future, 
seeing her wither while he went 
on as he was. 

He averted his face and his 
eyes filled with dammed-up tears. 

Gently she disengaged her 
hand. He felt it stroking, stroking 
his wrist. And she had the wit, or 
the luck, to say absolutely noth- 
ing as she did it. 

When he thought back on it, 
much later, he thought, too, that 
though there were many women 
who could do many things Bev- 
erly couldn’t do, not one of them 
would have done just that in 
just that way. 

In the spring, sensitive as he 
was to the feelings of his co- 
workers, he turned down a pro- 
motion. This would benefit him

far more in the long run. And 
again it was summer and this 
time there would be a vacation. 

Well — where? 

He would choose a place and 
Beverly would say, “If that’s 
what you want, darling,” and off 
they’d go. 

He thought and he thougiit 
about it. He had total recall and 
he recreated a great many scenes 
for himself. He all but decided 
and then he hesitated; and then, 
sitting at his desk in the office, 
he said aloud, “No! Not yet!” 
and startled some people. 

T hey went to New England, 
to a place new to them, crag- 
gy, rugged, sparkling, where 
sailboats notched the skyline and 
the wind smelled clean, unused 
by anyone else. For four days, 
they fished and swam, danced 
and dug gooeyducks. On the fifth 
day, they stayed snugly indoors 
while the sky pressed down like 
a giant’s palm. At three o’clock, 
the small-craft warnings went up. 
At four, the Coast Guard called 
and warned them away from 
their rented shack; yes, it was a 
hurricane, a real hurricane and 
not just a storm. 

They loaded the car haphaz- 
ardly and tumbled into it, and 
already there was a blinding fog 
of spume blowing horizontally 
across the coast road. They 
ground up the hill to the town 



and pulled into the hotel yard. 

The hotel, of course, was full, 
with a bed laid in the linen room 
and a cot set up behind the 
desk. 

“What are we going to do?” 
Beverly wailed. It was not dis- 
tress. Not yet — this was exciting. 

“We’re going to have a drink,” 
he said. “Then we’re going to 
have some hot chowder. Then 
we’re going to think about what 
we’re going to do.” 

So, with their lungs full of 
ozone and their eyes full of 
sparks, they went to the dining 
room. 

There was a picture which, 
say, a year ago, Yancey used to 
call to mind so often that it was 
as familiar as his safety razor. A 
slim back, wide shoulders clad in 
rich brown moleskin, lamplight 
glancing from dark obedient hair, 
and a long, brown hand resting 
lightly against an ivory cheek. 
When he saw it now, right before 
his eyes, he discounted it as an 
unwelcome phantom, a trick of 
the charged air. 

But Beverly squeezed his el- 
bow and cried, “Yance — look!” 
And before he could draw a 
breath, she sprang away from 
him to the table. 

“Lois! Lois, whatever in the 
world are you doing here?” 

This, Yancey told himself 
heavily, just had to happen. He 
went forward. “Hello, Lois.”

“Well!” It was a single syl- 
lable, but it contained warmth 
and welcome and . but how 
would you ever know, even when 
she smiled? A mask can smile. 
“Sit down. Please sit down, Bev- 
erly, Yancey.” 

There was a rush of small talk. 
Oh, yes, she had sold the resort 
last spring. Worked for a while 
in town. Resigned, looking for 
something better. Came up here 
to let the wind blow the smog out 
of her hair. “Now I’m afraid it’ll 
take the hair, too.” 

Oh, yes, Beverly was saying, 
so warmly, so proudly . two 
promotions . turned down 
another one. He’ll run the place 
in another year, just you watch 
. And a good deal more, while 
Lois watched her hands and 
smiled a small smile. “What 
about you, Lois? Are you mar- 
ried or anything?” 

“No,” said Lois huskily, “I’m 
not married — " and here Yancey 
looked away; he couldn’t bear 
to meet her eyes while she said 
it — “or anything.” 

They had a drink, and another, 
and then some superlative New 
England chowder, and beer, and 
another drink. And then it was 
over and Yancey, paying the 
check, was telling himself glumly 
you did fine, boy; so if you’re 
a little on the silent side for a 
day or two, what’s the difference? 
I’m glad it’s over. (But I wish...) 



R ising, Beverly said, “You’re 
staying here?” 

Lois smiled oddly. “There’s 
nothing they can do about it.” 
Before he could stop himself, 
Yancey said, “Now what exactly 
does that mean?” 

“I just got in an hour and a 
half ago. I never dreamed I’d 
need a reservation. Funny, isn’t 
it, after my experience? An3nvay, 
no vacancies. I shall just sit 
here until they want to close the 
place. I will then be a problem 
and it’ll be up to them to solve 
it.” She laughed quietly. “I’ve 
solved worse ones in my time.” 
“Lois, you can’t!” Beverly 
cried. “They’ll make you sleep on 
the bar!” 

She shrugged, really not car- 
ing. 

“Yancey,” said Beverly, flush- 
ed and urgent, “do you remem- 
ber a time when two wet 
strangers couldn’t find their beds 
and what happened to them?” 

He did meet Lois’s eyes this 
time. This was when his heart 
began hammering. 

Beverly said, “Now it’s our 
turn. We’re going down the coast. 
We’ll find a place. Come on. 
Come on, Lois!” 

Yancey thought, listen to her, 
taking the bit in her teeth. Does- 
n’t she usually find out first what 
I want? And he answered himself, 
no; most of the time she just 
does what I want without asking.

And, he told himself further, 
stop talking like a damn fool. 

Ten miles south, there was a 
town with a hotel. Full up. Four 
miles farther, a motel. Packed 
to the eaves. The next stretch was 
twenty miles and it was getting 
late. It was raining the kind of 
rain they had slogged through to 
Lois’s cabin two years before, 
but this time they had a howling 
gale along with it. 

And by the time they reached 
the next town, the warnings were 
in. The hurricane, true to its un- 
predictible breed, had swung east, 
leaving rain and a maddened sea, 
but no further danger. So they 
drove into the slick, shining 
streets of a city still quaking in 
its boots, but vastly relieved. 

Here and there a store was 
open. There were three hotels, 
two of them full. They stopped at 
an all-night drugstore to ask di- 
rections to the third and Lois 
bought cigarettes and Beverly 
found a book-club edition of 
Anna Karenina and scooped it up 
with joy; she said she’d always 
Ayanted to read it. 

The third hotel had one double 
with bath. 

“Twin beds?’’ 

The clerk nodded. Yancey 
looked at Lois, but her eyes were 
cloaked. He looked at Beverly 
and she said, “Why not? We can 
fit in a twin bed. I’m not very 
big.’’ 



No, he thought, you’re not. 

Lois said, “Beverly — ” 

“Shh,’’ said Beverly. “We’ll 
take it,” she told the clerk. 

T OIS turned again. Now she 
was looking up at the ceiling 
with him. Think of that, he 
thought acidly — here we are 
sharing some antiseptic moon- 
beams ! 

His biting thought was protec- 
tion for a very brief while. His 
heart began again. It shook him 
with each beat. It shook the bed, 
the walls, the building, the beaten 
cliff outside, making it hurl back 
the sea with even greater viol- 
ence. 

There was the softest butter- 
fly-wing touch on his chest. Bev- 
erly had opened her eyes. 

Yancey thought madly, it’s 
like one of those meaningless 
conjugations they give you in 
first-year French. I stare up into 
the darkness, you stare up in- 
to the darkness, she stares up 
into the darkness . 

Beverly wriggled up closer to 
him. She put her hand behind his 
head, pulling it toward her, and 
put her mouth on his ear. 

Barely audible, her breath said, 
“Darling, what is it? What do 
you want?” 

What did he want? Nothing, of 
course. Nothing he could have. 
Nothing, certainly, that he 
should have.

He shook his head. 

Beverly crept back until her 
head was on his shoulder again. 
She lay still. She slid one'diand 
over his chest, to rest lightly on 
his hammering heart. 

Lois sighed quietly and turned 
over, away from them. The wind 
laughed and laughed outside, and 
another breaker smashed and 
spouted. The room grew black, 
then silver again. 

An hour-long five minutes 
passed. 

Abruptly, Beverly sat up. “I 
can’t sleep,” she said clearly. 

Lois was silent. Yancey watch- 
ed Beverly. The silver light made 
everything in the room look like 
an overexposed photograph, but 
Beverly’s flesh seemed pink — the 
only thing in the whole wild, 
pulsing world that had any color 
but gray or black or silver. 

Beverly swung her legs out, 
stood up and stretched in the 
moonlight. She was small and 
firm and — pink? Was she really 
pink or was that a memory, too, 
like the reconstruction of the two 
kinds of darkness on Lois’s pil- 
low that to his mind looked like 
Lois’s face and hair? 

What a beautiful complement- 
ation, he thought hotly; how 
balanced an equation expresses 
this chaos! Beverly, small and 
fair, open, simple, direct. Lois, 
tall, slender, dark, devious, com- 
plex. And each so clearly lacking 



just what the other — ^had. 

Beverly said, “I have nineteen 
chapters of Anna Karenina to 
read.” She knelt on Yancey’s bed 
briefly, reached across to the 
night table and scooped some- 
thing up. Then she took the book 
off the highboy and went into 
the bathroom.. Yellow light ap- 
peared starkly under the closed 
door. 

Yancey lay quite still, looking 
at the line of light. He heard 
Lois’s sheets. 

At last he rolled over and 
looked at her. He could see the 
sliver of yellow again, across her 
eyes. She was half-sitting, rest- 
ing her weight on one slender 
arm. She was looking at him, or 
past him, to the closed door. 

“What was that she picked up 
from the night table, Yancey?” 

“Her watch.” 

Lois made a sound — perhaps, 
“Oh.” She sank down, slowly, 
until she rested on her elbow. 
She was looking at him now. He 
would know that even if he clos- 
ed his eyes. 

H e lay still, wondering if 
Lois could hear his heart. 
She probably could. Beverly 
probably could, right through 
the door. 

He wondered, with shattering 
incbnsequentiality, whether Bev- 
erly really liked red drapes. 

Lois made a slight motion with 



HURRICANE TRIO

her chin toward the yellow gleam. 
She whispered, “I couldn’t do 
that.” And again the gesture. 
“What she did then.” 

A great, hungry yearning came 
over him, but at the moment, 
incredibly, it seemed to have no 
direction. It yawned somewhere 
beneath him, waiting to engulf 
him. And then, seeing the polish- 
ed yellow lines in Lois’s eyes, it 
came to him which of these wo- 
men was simple and direct, and 
which was subtle and deep and 
complex. 

“I couldn’t do that,” Lois had 
said. How many other things 
could Beverly do that Lois could 
not? 

What kind of woman was Bev- 
erly? 

For the very first time, Yancey 
Bowman asked himself what had 
happened to ‘Beverly the day he 
was killed. He’d assumed she was 
simply in cold storage while they 
put him back together. He’d as- 
sumed . how could he assume 
such a thing? He had never even 
asked about her. That was im- 
possible! Unnatural! 

But of course — he wasn’t to 
ask. He would not have thought 
of it and the chances were that 
he could not have asked her even 
if he’d thought to. 

Why could he think of it now? 

It must be time to think of it. 
Something had happened to him, 
permitting him to. Qualifying 



him to. But — he hadn’t changed; 
he couldn’t change. He was built 
and rebuilt and designed and re- 
designed to be Yancey Plus. 
What change could . 

Supposing, he told himself, 
they had a very young thing to 
rebuild. Wouldn’t they build it 
so that it could go on growing? 
Then — he could have grown. 
How? How? 

Well, what would he have done 
in this same mad situation, two 
years ago, even after he left the 
spaceship? 

He wouldn’t nave lain here 
these swift seconds, speculating; 
that was for sure. 

“I couldn’t do that,” Lois had 
whispered. 

Supposing Beverly had been 
killed, too, and changed as he 
had been changed. He had never 
told her what he knew; why 
would she have told him? Wasn’t 
the prime purpose to improve a 
little, but to change nothing? He 
was Yancey Plus, who went right 
ahead ruling the roost, accepting 
his wife’s quiet variety of slave 
labor. Wouldn’t she go right on 
being Beverly, giving him always 
what he wanted? And if she were 
Beverly . Plus, wouldn’t she 
do . just this? 

W HAT’S the matter with me, 
he cried silently — why 
didn’t I ask her?- Why couldn’t 
I see? 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He found, to his astonishment, 
that he had only to ask this 
question to have it answered. 
Nothing responded; it was just 
that the answer, lying within 
him, was uncovered. You may 
not. 

I never could ask her. I can’t 
now. I shall never be able to. 
And — I don’t want to, I don’t 
need to! 

And she can’t — may not — ask 
me! 

Then it was, with a surge of 
relief that made his head spin, 
that his heart eased and he smil- 
ed. He knew now how he had 
changed, how he had grown. He 
knew Beverly had changed. He 
knew, all at once, what to do 
now and what to do for the rest 
of his life with Beverly. 

All this in seconds, and he be- 
came aware again of the yellow 
lights in Lois’s long eyes. He 
changed the subject by using her 
exact words. “I couldn’t do that,” 
he whispered. 



Lois nodded slowly. She sank 
back on the pillow and closed 
her eyes. He thought she trembl- 
ed. He didn’t know. He didn’t 
much care. He turned over and 
filled his lungs, as he had not 
been able to do for more than an 
hour because of his leaping 
heart. "Beverly!” he bellowed. 

The book fell on the tiles. 
There was silence for a moment 
and then the door opened. 

“Yes, Yance?” 

“Get back to bed, idiot. You 
can read that book some other 
time. You need your sleep.” 

“I just — all right, Yance, if you 
want.” 

She switched off the light and 
came in. A moonbeam swept 
across her face as she approached.’ 
She was looking across him at 
Lois, her lips trembling. She got 
into bed. He put his arms around 
her, gently, humbly. She turned 
to him and suddenly held him so 
tight that he almost cried out.

Here is 1955's first important science 
fiction book— a dazzling literary one- 
man show. Many of the magazines 
these stories appeared in are now 
collector's items that cost as much as 
this whole volume. 

Distinguishing this brilliant collec- 
tion from all others are the vivid notes 
from the author's own working journal, 
giving the thematic origin and back- 
ground of every story. Fascinating for 
readers and immensely valuable for 
writers, they demonstrate the skill and 
bravura that have made H. L. Gold 
an acknowledged master both as 
author and editor of science fiction. 

FOR YOU ONLY! 

Only Galaxy readers can have this 
very special extra . 









Crown Publishers have set aside 250 first edition copies— and there's one 
personally inscribed and autographed for YOU— if you promptly send in
