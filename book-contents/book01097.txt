WHAT’S THE SCORE? 



A N EASY card game for very 
young children is “Slapjack”. 
It is played with a 5 2 -card deck, 
but it doesn’t have much in com- 
mon with contract bridge or 
poker. You take a deck of cards, 
divide it more or less in half and 
turn the cards up one at a time. 
Every time a jack turns up, the 
players try to slap it. First player 
to get his palm over it wins that 
round. 

Tic-Tac-Toe represents a sec- 
ond stage in complexity. As a 
game for young children it has 
several merits, both as a way of 
passing a rainy day and as a sort 
of rough-hewn test of intelligence 
or of maturity, since the age at 
which the player learns that the 



outcome of the game can be con- 
trolled completely — that chance 
has no part in it, and that all of 
its strategies can be learned and 
simply expressed — is also about 
the age at which he learns that 
he need not always consider the 
ordinances of Mommy and Daddy 
to be Divine Law. 

Slightly later, and considerably 
more challenging, checkers gets 
added to the list. In the Games 
Theory view of checkers it can be 
considered as a zero-sum game 
with finite choices. That is, when 
one player wins, the other loses; 
and the number of possible re- 
spK>nses to any move is rather 
easily calculated. Chess is still 
more complex, for, although the 



4 



GALAXY 



outcome is unquestionably con- 
trollable, in practice the human 
mind is not capable of memo- 
rizing all of the possible moves 
and their consequences, so that 
the expert player falls back on 
what is called “position evalua- 
tion.” The strategy of a Botvinnik 
or a Capablanca is not aimed di- 
rectly toward winning. It is aimed 
toward securing a board position 
and a favorable balance of forces 
such that winning then becomes 
inevitable. That may sound at 
first blush like a distinction with- 
out a difference; but in fact it is 
the difference between, say, the 
single combat of medieval knights 
and modern war. 

It doesn’t much matter whether 
you play chess poorly or well; if 
you try to play it at all, you are 
a long way from Slapjack. 

T he history of man’s at- 
tempt to control his environ- 
ment — by which we can include 
everything from pulling a branch 
over himself in a rainstorm to 
the framing of the law of con- 
servation of parity — passes 
through an evolution rather like 
the development of an indivi- 
dual’s mastery of games. Paleo- 
lithic man was in the Slapjack 
period: If any feature of his en- 
vironment gave him trouble, he 
whanged at it until one of two 
things happened. Either he sud- 
denly discovered he had a pretty 



good obsidian knife, or he gave 
up. Modern man, or so we like 
to think, has pretty well caught 
the hang of the “chess” approach 
to solving his problems. He is 
still playing a game. But it is a 
larger game, in a different con- 
text. 

When we say that the jM'Ogress 
of scientific knowledge is meas- 
ured by the enlargement of con- 
texts, we are saying that we ad- 
vance by learning truths which 
are more general than the truths 
we knew before. We frame em- 
pirical “laws” — the law of Con- 
servation of Energy — and some- 
body draws from them still other 
laws (as did Carnot and the rest 
of the great mechanist-minded 
scientists) . until some other 
person, trying to understand why 
these laws should be so, frames a 
still more general law (as did Ein- 
stein) and we find, by gosh, that 
our first law isn’t really a law at 
all. Energy can so be created — 
by transformation from matter; 
and it can be destroyed by trans- 
formation in the other direction. 

This does not mean that the 
previous laws are false, thus de- 
stroying the deductions made 
from them: Carnot’s model of a 
heat engine still works perfectly. 
The laws are still true, in terms 
of the contexts then existing; but 
now they are only special cases 
within larger laws. 

You can, if you like, compare 



WHAT'S THE SCORE?

this enlargement of contexts with 
a mastery of increasingly sophisti- 
cated games. Slapjack to Tic-Tac- 
Toe: from the planless fumbling 
of primitive man to the learned- 
by-rote “medicine”, say, of Hippo- 
crates. Tic-Tac-Toe to checkers: 
from the Hippocratic empirical 
remedies to the experimentation 
and theorizing of Galen. Checkers 
to chess: from Galen’s dissection 
of corpses to antibiotics and the 
analysis of DNA. 

All this is analogy and perhaps 
a little strained, for nothing is 
more deadly than to force conclu- 
sions from an analogy. But per- 
haps it is not just an analogy; for 
science is itself a sort of game. 

rpHINK OF science as a game 
board, and think of a very 
large, very complex computer 
across the board from us as our 
Opponent. 

The Opponent never cheats. 
He plays according to our rules. 
He plays the games we teach him. 
If we are playing the game called 
Chemistry, he will go pokerfaced 
along with the rules — all the 
rules — including the rule that 
elements cannot be transmuted 
one to the other. If you want 
one of the moves in the game to 
be the change of uranium into 
lead, you have to change the 
game, to one variety or another 
of the game called Physics. If 
you are playing the game called 



Euclidean geometry, the Oppo- 
nent won’t let you trisect an an- 
gle. If you want to do that you 
must switch to the game called 
algebra, where you can trisect all 
the angles you like with a simple 
cubic equation. And behold! that 
which was impossible, and which 
everybody knew to be impossible, 
and which was proved to be im- 
possible ... is no longer impossi- 
ble at all. 

All you have to do is change 
the game. 

It is this point that is so hard 
to get across to the sort of closed 
mind that says, “We know that 
ESP is impossible” or “We have 
proved that no material object 
can be accelerated past the ve- 
locity of light in a vacuum.” In 
fact, we do not know anything 
of the kind. We only know that 
the rules of the games we’re play- 
ing today say so; but we do not 
know, and can only with difficulty 
imagine, the rules of the games 
we may play tomorrow. 

That, of course, is the thing, 
or one of the things, that science 
fiction is all about. 

A science-fiction story we must 
admit is only a game, sugar- 
coated with adventure, touched 
with humor, scented with ro- 
mance. Games they are — but 
who is to say that some day soon 
we won’t be playing some of them 
for keeps?

GALAXY 




THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally tolA — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes toaay.

lyrANKIND consisted of 128 
people. 

The sheer population pressure 
of so vast a horde had long ago 
filled over a dozen burrows. 
Bands of the Male Society occu- 
pied the outermost four of these 
interconnected corridors and pa- 
trolled it with their full strength, 
twenty-three young adult males 
in the prime of courage and alert- 
ness. They were stationed there 
to take the first shock of any 
danger to Mankind, they and 
their band captains and the 
youthful initiates who served 
them. 

Eric the Only was an initiate 
in this powerful force. Today, he 
was a student warrior, a fetcher 
and a carrier for proven, seasoned 
men. But tomorrow, tomorrow . 

This was his birthday. Tomor- 
row, he would be sent forth to 
Steal for Mankind. When he re- 
turned — and have no fear: Eric 
was swift, Eric was clever, he 
would return — off might go the 
loose loin cloths of boyhood to 
be replaced by the tight loin 
straps of a proud Male Society 
warrior. 

He would be free to raise his 
voice and express his opinions in 
the Councils of Mankind. He 
could stare at the women when-

ever he liked, for as long as he 
liked, to approach them even — 

He found himself wandering to 
the end of his band’s burrow, still 
carrying the spear he was sharp- 
ening for his uncle. There, where 
a women’s burrow began, several 
members of the Female Society 
were preparing food stolen from 
the Monster larder that very day. 
Each spell had to be performed 
properly, each incantation said 
just right, or it would not be fit 
to eat. It might even be danger- 
ous. Mankind was indeed fortu- 
nate: plenty of food, readily 

available, and women who well 
understood the magical work of 
preparing it for human consump- 
tion. 

And such women — such 
splendid creatures! 

Sarah the Sickness-Healer, for 
example, with her incredible 
knowledge of what food was fit 
and what was unfit, her only gar- 
ment a cloud of hair that alter- 
nately screened and revealed her 
hips and breasts, the largest in 
all Mankind. There was a woman 
for you! Over five litters she had 
had, two of them of maximum 
size. 

Eric watched as she turned a 
yellow chunk of food around and 
around under the glow lamp 
hanging from the ceiling of the 
burrow, looking for she only 
knew what and recognizing it 
when she found it she only knew 



how. A man could really strut 
with such a mate. 

But she was the wife of a band 
leader and far, far beyond him. 
Her daughter, though, Selma the 
Soft-Skinned, would probably be 
flattered by his attentions. She 
still wore her hair in a heavy 
bun: it would be at least a year 
before the Female Society would 
consider her an initiate and al- 
low her to drape it about her 
nakedness. No, far too young and 
unimportant for a man on the 
very verge of warrior status. 

Another girl caught his eye. 
She had been observing him for 
some time and smiling behind her 
lashes, behind her demurely set 
mouth. Harriet the History-Tel- 
ler, the oldest daughter of Rita 
the Record-Keeper, who would 
one day succeed to her mother’s 
office. Now there was a lovely, 
slender girl, her hair completely 
unwound in testament to full 
womanhood and recognized pro- 
fessional status. 

'C’RIC had caught these covert, 
barely stated smiles from 
her before; especially in the last 
few weeks, as the time for his 
Theft approached. He knew that 
if he were successful — and he 
had to be successful: don’t dare 
think of an5Tthing but success! — 
she would look with favor on ad- 
vances from him. Of course, Har- 
riet was a redhead, and therefore, 



10 



GALAXY 



according to Mankind’s tradi- 
tions, unlucky. She was probably 
having a hard time finding a 
mate. But his own mother had 
been a redhead. 

Yes, and his mother had been 
very unlucky indeed. 

Even his father had been in- 
fected with her terrible bad luck. 
Still, Harriet the History-Teller 
was an important person in the 
tribe for one her age. Good-look- 
ing too. And, above all, she didn’t 
turn away from him. She smiled 
at him, openly now. He smiled 
back. 

“Look at Eric!” he heard some- 
one call out behind him. “He’s 
already searching for a mate. 
Hey, Eric! You’ve not even wear- 
ing straps yet First comes the 
stealing. Then comes the mating.” 

Eric spun around, bits of fan- 
tasy still stuck to his lips. 

The group of young men loung- 
ing against the wall of his band’s 
burrow were tossing laughter 
back and forth between them. 
They were all adults: they had 
all made their Theft. Socially, 
they were still his superiors. His 
only recourse was cold dignity. 

“I know that,” he began. “There 
is no mating until — ” 

“Until never for some people,” 
one of the young men broke in. 
He rattled his spear in his hand, 
carelessly, proudly. “After you 
steal, you still have to convince 
a woman that you’re a man. And 



some men have to do an awful 
lot of convincing. An awful lot, 
Eric-O.” 

The ball of laughter bounced 
back, and forth again, heavier 
than before. Eric the Only felt 
his face turn bright red. How 
dare they remind him of his 
birth? On this day of all days? 
Here he was about to prepare 
himself to go forth and Steal for 
Mankind . 

He dropped the sharpening 
stone into his pouch and slid his 
right hand back along his uncle’s 
spear. “At least,” he said, slowly 
and definitely, “at least, my 
woman will stay convinced, Roy 
the Runner. She won’t be always 
open to offers from every other 
man in the tribe.” 

“You lousy little throwback!” 
Roy the Runner yelled. He 
leaped away from the rest of the 
band and into a crouch facing 
Eric, his spear tense in one hand. 
“You’re asking for a hole in the 
belly! My woman’s had two lit- 
ters off me, two big litters. What 
would you have given her, you 
dirty singleton?” 

“She’s had two litters, but not 
off you,” Eric the Only spat, 
holding his spear out in the guard 
position. “If you’re the father, 
then the chief’s blonde hair is 
contagious — like measles.” 

Roy bellowed and jabbed his 
spear forward. Eric parried it and 
lunged in his turn. He missed as

his opponent leaped to one side. 
They circled each other, cursing 
and insulting, eyes only for the 
point of each other’s sjjears. The 
other young men had scrambled 
a distance down the burrow to 
get out of their way. 

A POWERFUL arm suddenly 
clamped Eric’s waist from 
behind and lifted him off his feet. 
He was kicked hard, so that he 
stumbled a half-dozen steps and 
fell. On his feet in a moment, the 
spear still in his hand, he whirled, 
ready to deal with this new op- 
ponent. He was mad enough to 
fight all Mankind. 

But not Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher. No, not that mad. 

All the tension drained out of 
him as he recognized the captain 
of his band. He couldn’t fight 
Thomas. His uncle. And the 
greatest of all men. Guiltily, he 
walked to the niche in the wall 
where the band’s weapons were 
stacked and slid his uncle’s spear 
into its appointed place. 

“What the hell’s the matter 
with you, Roy?” Thomas was 
asking behind him. “Fighting a 
duel with an initiate? Where’s 
your band spirit? That’s all we 
need these days, to be cut down 
from six effectives to five. Save 
your spear for Strangers, or — 
if you feel vety brave — for 
Monsters. But don’t show a point 
in our band’s burrow if you know 



what’s good for you, hear me?” 

“I wasn’t fighting a duel,” the 
Runner mumbled, sheathing his 
own spear. “The kid got above 
himself. I was punishing him.” 

“You punish with the haft of 
the spear. And anyway, this is my 
band and I do the punishing 
around here. Now move on out, 
all of you, and get ready for the 
council. I’ll attend to the boy my- 
self.” 

They went off obediently with- 
out looking back. The Trap- 
Smasher’s band was famous for 
its discipline throughout the 
length and breadth of Mankind. 
A proud thing to be a member 
of it. But to be called a boy in 
front of the others! A boy, when 
he was full-grown and ready to 
begin stealing! 

Although, come to think of it, 
he’d rather be called a boy than 
a singleton. A boy eventually be- 
came a man, but a singleton 
stayed a singleton forever. He put 
the problem to his uncle who 
was at the niche, inspecting the 
band’s reserve pile of spears. 

“Isn’t it possible — I mean, it 
is possible, isn’t it — that my 
father had some children by an- 
other woman? You told me he 
was one of the best thieves we 
ever had.” 

The captain of the band turned 
to study him, folding his arms 
across his chest so that biceps 
swelled into greatness and power.

They glinted in the light of the 
tiny lantern bound to his fore- 
head, the glow lantern that only 
fully accredited warriors might 
wear. After a while, the older man 
shook his head and said, very 
gently: 

“Eric, Eric, forget about it, 
boy. He was all of those things 
and more. Your father was fa- 
mous. Eric the Storeroom-Storm- 
er, we called him, Eric the Laugh- 
er at Locks, Eric the Roistering 
Robber of all Mankind. He 
taught me everything I know. But 
he only married once. And if any 
other woman ever played around 
with him, she’s been careful to 
keep it a secret. Now dress up 
those spears. You’ve let them get 
all sloppy. Butts together, that’s 
the way, points up and even with 
each other.” 

l^UTIFULLY, Eric rearranged 
■L' the bundle of armament that 
was his responsibility. He turned 
to his uncle again, now examining 
the knapsacks and canteens that 
would be carried on the expedi- 
tion. “Suppose there had been an- 
other woman. My father could 
have had two, three, even four 
litters by different women. Extra- 
large litters too. If we could prove 
something like that, I wouldn’t 
be a singleton any more. I would 
not be Eric the Only.” 

The Trap-Smasher sighed and 
thought for a moment. Then he 



pulled the spear from his back 
sling and took Eric’s arm. He 
drew the youth along the burrow 
until they stood alone in the very 
center of it. He looked carefully 
at the exits at either end, making 
certain that they were completely 
alone before giving his reply in 
an unusually low, guarded voice. 

“We’d never be able to prove 
anything like that. If you don’t 
want to be Eric the Only, if you 
want to be Eric the something- 
else, well then, it’s up to you. You 
have to make a good Theft. 
That’s what you should be think- 
ing about all the time now — 
your Theft. Eric, which category 
are you going to announce?” 

He hadn’t thought about it 
very much. “The usual one I 
guess. The one that’s picked for 
most initiations. First category.” 
The older man brought his lips 
together, looking dissatisfied. 
“First category. Food. Well . .” 
Eric felt he understood. “You 
mean, for someone like me — an 
Only, who’s really got to make a 
name for himself — I ought to 
announce like a real warrior? I 
should say I’m going to steal in 
the second category — Articles 
Useful to Mankind. Is that what 
my father would have done?” 
“Do you know what your fath- 
er would have done?” 

“No. What?” Eric demanded 
eagerly. 

“He’d have elected the third 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



13 



category. That’s what I’d be an- 
nouncing these days, if I were 
going through an initiation cere- 
mony. That’s what I want you to 
announce.” 

“Third category? Monster sou- 
venirs? But no one’s elected the 
third category in I don’t know 
how many auld lang synes. Why 
should I do it?” 

“Because this is more than just 
an initiation ceremony. It could 
be the beginning of a new life for 
all of us.” 

Eric frowned. What could be 
more than an initiation ceremony 
and his attainment of full thiev- 
ing manhood? 

“There are things going on in 
Mankind, these days,” Thomas 
the Trap-Smasher continued in a 
strange, urgent voice. “Big things. 
And you’re going to be a part of 
them. This Theft of yours — if 
you handle it right, if you do what 
I tell you, it’s likely to blow the 
lid off everything the chief has 
been sitting on.” 

“The chief?” Eric felt confused. 
He was walking up a strange bur- 
row now without a glow lamp. 
“Whats the chief got to do with 
my Theft?” 

¥¥IS uncle examined both ends 
of the corridor again. “Eric, 
what’s the most important thing 
we, or you, or anyone, can do? 
What is our life all about? What 
are we here for?” 



“That’s easy,” Eric chuckled. 
“That’s the easiest question there 
is. A child could answer it: 

“Hit back at_ the Monsters,” he 
quoted. “Drive them from the 
planet, if we can. Regain Earth 
for Mankind, if we can. But 
above all, hit back at the Mon- 
sters. Make them suffer as they’ve 
made us suffer. Make them know 
we’re still here, we’re still fighting. 
Hit back at the Monsters.” 

“Hit back at the Monsters. 
Right. Now how have we been 
doing that?” 

Eric the Only stared at his 
uncle. That wasn’t the next ques- 
tion in the catechism. He must 
have heard incorrectly. His uncle 
couldn’t have made a mistake in 
such a basic ritual. 

“We will do that,” he went on 
in the second reply, his voice 
sliding into the singsong of child- 
hood lessons, “by regaining the 
science and knowhow of our fore- 
fathers. Man was once Lord of all 
Creation: his science and know- 
how made him supreme. Science 
and knowhow is what we need to 
hit back at the Monsters.” 

“Now, Eric,” his tmcle asked 
gently. “Please tell me this. What 
in hell is knowhow?” 

That was way off. They were a 
full corridor’s length from the 
normal progression of the cate- 
chism now. 

“Knowhow is — knowhow is 
— ” he stumbled over the un- 



14 



GALAXY 



familiar verbal terrain. “Well, it’s 
what our ancestors knew. And 
what they did with it, I guess. 
Knowhow is what you need be- 
fore you can make hydrogen 
bombs or economic warfare or 
guided missiles, any of those real- 
ly big weapons like our ancestors 
had.” 

“Did those weapons do them 
any good? Against the Monsters, 
I mean. Did they stop the Mon- 
sters?” 

Eric looked completely blank 
for a moment, then brightened. 
Oh! He knew the way now. He 
knew how to get back to the 
catechism: 

“The suddenness of the attack, 
the — ” 

“Stop it!” his uncle ordered. 
“Don’t give me any of that gar- 
bage! The suddenness of the at- 
tack, the treachery of the Mon- 
sters — does it sound like an ex- 
planation to you? Honestly? If 
our ancestors were really Lords of 
Creation and had such great 
weapons, would the Monsters 
have been able to conquer them? 
I’ve led my band on dozens of 
raids, and I know the value of a 
surprise attack; but believe me, 
boy, it’s only good for a flash 
charge and a quick getaway if 
you’re facing a superior force. 
You can knock somebody down 
when he doesn’t expect it But 
if he really has more than you, 
he won’t stay down. Right?” 



“I — I guess so. I wouldn’t 
know.” 

“Well, I know. I know from 
plenty of battle experience. The 
thing to remember is that once 
our ancestors were knocked down, 
they stayed down. That means 
their science and knowhow were 
not so much in the first place. 
And that means — ” here he 
turned his head and looked di- 
rectly into Eric’s eyes — “that 
means the science of our ances- 
tors wasn’t worth one good damn 
against the Monsters, and it 
wouldn’t be worth one good 
damn to us!” 

Eric the Only turned pale. He 
knew heresy when he heard it. 

¥¥IS uncle patted him on the 
shoulder, drawing a deep 
breath as if he’d finally spat out 
something extremely unpleasant. 
He leaned closer, eyes glittering 
beneath the forehead glow lamp 
and his voice dropped to a fierce 
whisper. 

“Eric. When I asked you how 
we’ve been hitting back at the 
Monsters, you told me what we 
ought to do. We haven’t been do- 
ing a single thing to bother them. 
We don’t know how to recon- 
struct the ancestor-science, we 
don’t have the tools or weapons 
or knowhow — whatever that is 
— but they wouldn’t do us a bit 
of good even if we had them. Be- 
cause they failed once. They

i 



failed completely and at their 
best. There’s just no point in try- 
ing to put them together again.” 

And now Eric understood. He 
understood why his imcle had 
whispered, why there had been 
so much strain in this conversa- 
tion. Bloodshed was involved 
here, bloodshed and death. 

“Uncle Thomas,” he whispered, 
in a voice that kept cracking de- 
spite his efforts to keep it whole 
and steady, “how long have you 
been an Alien-Science man? 
When did you leave Ancestor- 
Science?” 

Thomas the Trap-Smasher ca- 
ressed his spear before he an- 
swered. He felt for it with a gen- 
tle, wandering arm, almost uncon- 
sciously, but both of them regis- 
tered the fact that it was loose 
and ready. His tremendous body, 
nude except for the straps about 
his loins and the light spear-sling 
on his back, looked as if it were 
preparing to move instantaneous- 
ly in any direction. 

He stared again from one end 
of the burrow to the other, his 
forehead lamp reaching out to 
the branching darkness of the 
exits. Eric stared with him. No 
one was leaning tightly against a 
wall and listening. 

“How long? Since I got to 
know your father. He was in an- 
other band; naturally we hadn’t 
seen much of each other before 
he married my sister. I’d heard 



about him, though: everyone in 
the Male Society had — he was 
a great thief. But once he be- 
came my brother-in-law, I learned 
a lot from him. I learned about 
locks, about the latest traps — 
and I learned about Alien-Sci- 
ence. He’d been an Alien-Science 
man for years. He converted your 
mother, and he converted me.” 

Eric the Only backed away. 
“No!” he called out wildly. “Not 
my father and mother! They were 
decent people — when they were 
killed a service was held in their 
name — they went to add to the 
science of our ancestors — ” 

¥¥IS uncle jammed a powerful 
hand over his mouth. 

“Shut up, you damn fool, or 
you’ll finish us both! Of course 
your parents were decent people. 
How do you think they were 
killed? Your mother was with 
your father out in Monster terri- 
tory. Have you ever heard of a 
woman going along with her hus- 
band on a Theft? And taking her 
baby with her? Do you think it 
was an ordinary robbery of the 
Monsters? They were Alien-sci- 
ence people, serving their faith 
as best they could. They died for 
it.” 

Eric looked into his uncle’s 
eyes over the hand that covered 
the lower half of his face. Alien- 
science people . serving their 
faith ... do you think it was an 



16 



GALAXY 



ordinary robbery . they died 
lor it! 

He had never realized before 
how odd it was that his parents 
had gone to Monster territory to- 
gether, a man taking his wife and 
the woman taking her baby! 

As he relaxed, his uncle re- 
moved the gagging hand. “What 
kind of Theft was it that my 
parents died in?” 

Thomas examined his face and 
seemed satisfied. “The kind you’re 
going after,” he said. “If you are 
your father’s son. If you’re man 
enough to continue the work he 
started. Are you?” 

Eric started to nod, then found 
himself shrugging weakly, and 
finally just hung his head. He 
didn’t know what to say. His 
uncle — well, his uncle was his 
model and his leader, and he was 
strong and wise and crafty. His 
father — naturally, he wanted to 
emulate his father and continue 
whatever work he had started. 
But this was his initiation cere- 
mony, after all, and there would 
be enough danger merely in 
proving his manhoood. For his 
initiation ceremony to take on a 
task that had destroyed his fath- 
er, the greatest thief the tribe had 
ever known, and a heretical, 
blasphemous task at that . 
“I’ll try. I don’t know if I can.” 
“You can,” his uncle told him 
heartily. “It’s been set up for you. 
It will be like walking through a 



dug burrow, Eric. All you have to 
face through is the council. You’ll 
have to be steady there, no mat- 
ter what. You tell the chief that 
you’re undertaking the third 
category.” 

“But why the third?” Eric 
asked. “Why does it have to be 
Monster souvenirs?” 

“Because that’s what we need. 
And you stick to it, no matter 
what pressure they put on you. 
Remember, an initiate has the 
right to decide what he’s going to 
steal. A man’s first Theft is his 
own affair.” 

“But, listen, uncle — ” 

There was a whistle from the 
end of the burrow. Thomas the 
Trap-Smasher nodded in the di- 
rection of the signal. 

“The council’s beginning, boy. 
We’ll talk later, on expedition. 
Now remember this: stealing 

from the third category is your 
own idea, and all your own idea. 
Forget everything else we’ve 
talked about. If you hit any 
trouble with the chief. I’ll be 
there. I’m your sponsor, after all.” 
He threw an arm about his 
confused nephew and walked to 
the end of the burrow where the 
other members of the band 
waited. 

II 

f^HE tribe had gathered in its 
central and largest burrow 
under the great, hanging glow 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS

lamps that might be used in this 
place alone. Except for the few 
sentinels on duty in the outlying 
corridors, all of Mankind was 
here. It was an awesome sight to 
behold. 

On the little hillock known as 
the Royal Mound, lolled Franklin 
the Father of Many Thieves, 
Chieftain of all Mankind. He 
alone of the cluster of warriors 
displayed heaviness of belly and 
flabbiness of arm — for he alone 
had the privilege of a sedentary 
life. Beside the sternly muscled 
band leaders who formed his im- 
mediate background, he looked 
almost womanly; and yet one of 
his many titles was simply The 
Man. 

Yes, unquestionably The Man 
of Mankind was Franklin the 
Father of Many Thieves. You 
could tell it from the hushed, re- 
spectful attitudes of the subor- 
dinate warriors who stood at a 
distance from the mound. You 
could tell it from the rippling in- 
terest of the women as they stood 
on the other side of the great bur- 
row, drawn up in the ranks of the 
Female Society. You could tell it 
from the nervousness and scorn 
with which the women were 
watched by their leader, Ottilie, 
the Chieftain’s First Wife. And 
finally, you could tell it from the 
faces of the children, standing in 
a distant, disorganized bunch. A 
clear majority of their faces bore 



an unmistakable resemblance to 
Franklin’s. 

Franklin clapped his hands, 
three evenly spaced, flesh-heavy 
wallops. 

“In the name of our ancestors,” 
he said, “and the science with 
which they ruled the Earth, I de- 
clare this council op>ened. May it 
end as one more step in the re- 
gaining of their science. Who 
asked for a council?” 

“I did.” Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher moved out of his band 
and stood before the chief. 

Franklin nodded, and went on 
with the next, formal question: 

“And your reason?” 

“As a band leader, I call at- 
tention to a candidate for man- 
hood. A member of my band, a 
spear-carrier for the required 
time, and an accepted apprentice 
in the Male Society. My nephew, 
Eric the Only.” 

As his name was sung out, Eric 
shook himself. Half on his own 
volition and half in response to 
the pushes he received from the 
other warriors, he stumbled up to 
his uncle and faced the chief. 
This, the most important moment 
of his life, was proving almost 
too much for him. So many peo- 
ple in one place, accredited and 
famous warriors, knowledgeable 
and attractive women, the chief 
himself, all this after the shatter- 
ing revelations from his uncle — 
he was finding it hard to think 



18 



GALAXY 



clearly. And it was vital to think 
clearly. His responses to the next 
few questions had to be exactly 

right. 

T he chief was asking the first: 
“Eric the Only, do you apply 
for full manhood?” 

Eric breathed hard and 
nodded. “I do.” 

“As a full man, what will be 
your value to Mankind?” 

“I will steal for Mankind what- 
ever it needs. I will defend Man- 
kind against all outsiders. I will 
increase the possessions and 
knowledge of the Female Society 
so that the Female Society can 
increase the power and well-be- 
ing of Mankind.” 

“And all this you swear to do?” 
“And all this I swear to do.” 
The Chief turned to Eric’s 
imcle. “As his sponsor, do you 
support his oath and swear that 
he is to be trusted?” 

With just the faintest hint of 
sarcasm in his voice, Thomas the 
Trap-Smasher replied: “Yes. I 
support his oath and swear that 
he is to be trusted.” 

There was a rattling moment, 
the barest second, when the 
chief’s eyes locked with those of 
the band leader. With all that 
was on Eric’s mind at the mo- 
ment, he noticed it. Then the 
chief looked away and pointed to 
the women on the other side of 
the burrow. 



“He is accepted as a candidate 
by the men. Now the women 
must ask for proof, for only a 
woman’s proof bestows full man- 
hood.” 

The first part was over. And 
it hadn’t been too bad. Eric 
turned to face the advancing 
leaders of the Female Society, Ot- 
tilie, the Chieftain’s First Wife, 
in the center. Now came the part 
that scared him. The women’s 
part. 

As was customary at such a 
moment, his uncle and sponsor 
left him when the women came 
forward. Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher led his band to the war- 
riors grouped about the Throne 
Mound. There, with their col- 
leagues, they folded their arms 
across their chests and turned to 
watch. A man can only give proof 
of his manhood while he is alone; 
his friends cannot support him 
once the women approach. 

It was not going to be easy, 
Eric realized. He had hoped that 
at least one of his uncle’s wives 
would be among the three exam- 
iners: they were both kindly peo- 
ple who liked him and had 
talked to him much about the 
mysteries of women’s work. But 
he had drawn a trio of hard-faced 
females who apparently intended 
to take him over the full course 
before they passed him. 

Sarah the Sickness-Healer 
opened the proceedings. She

circled him belligerently, hands 
on hips, her great breasts rolling 
to and fro like a pair of swollen 
pendulums, her eyes glittering 
with scorn. 

“Eric the Only,” she intoned, 
and then paused to grin, as if it 
were a name impossible to be- 
lieve, “Eric the Singleton, Eric the 
one and only child of either his 
mother or his father. Your par- 
ents almost didn’t have enough 
between them to make a solitary 
child. Is there enough in you to 
make a man?” 

^^HERE was a snigger of ap- 
preciation from the children 
in the distance, and it was echoed 
by a few growling laughs from 
the vicinity of the Throne 
Mound. Eric felt his face and 
neck go red. He would have 
fought any man to the death for 
remarks like these. Any man at 
all. But who could lift his hand 
to a woman and be allowed to 
live? Besides, one of the main 
purposes of this exhibition was 
to investigate his powers of self- 
control. 

“I think so,” he managed to 
say after a long pause. “And I’m 
willing to prove it.” 

“Prove it, then!” the woman 
snarled. Her right hand, holding 
a long, sharp-pointed pin, shot to 
his chest like a flung spear. Eric 
made his muscles rigid and tried 
to send his mind away. That, the 



men had told him, was what you 
had to do at this moment: it was 
not you they were hurting, not 
you at all. You, your rnind, your 
knowledge of self, were in an- 
other part of the burrow entirely, 
watching these painful things be- 
ing done to someone else. 

The pin sank into his chest 
for a little distance, paused, came 
out. It probed here, probed there; 
finally it found a nerve in his 
upper arm. There, guided by the 
knowledge of the Sickness-Heal- 
er, it bit and clawed at the deli- 
cate area until Eric felt he would 
grind his teeth to powder in the 
effort not to cry out. His clenched 
fists twisted agonizingly at the 
ends of his arms in a paroxysm 
of protest, but he kept his body 
still. He didn’t cry out; he didn’t 
move away; he didn’t raise a 
hand to protect himself. 

Sarah the Sickness-Healer 
stepped back and considered him. 
“There is no man here yet,” she 
said grudgingly. “But perhaps 
there is the beginnings of one.” 

He could relax. The physical 
test was over. There would be 
another one, much later, after he 
had completed his theft success- 
fully; but that would be exclu- 
sively by men as part of his proud 
initiation ceremony. Under the 
circumstances, he knew he would 
be able to go through it almost 
gaily. 

Meanwhile, the women’s physi- 



20 



GALAXY 



cal test was over. That was the 
important thing for now. In 
sheer reaction, his body gushed 
forth sweat which slid over the 
bloody cracks in his skin and 
stung viciously. He felt the water 
pouring down his back and 
forced himself not to go limp, 
prodded his mind into alertness. 

“Did that hurt?” he was being 
asked by Rita, the old crone of 
a Record-Keeper. There was a 
solicitous smile on her forty-year- 
old face, but he knew it was a 
fake. A woman as old as that no 
longer felt sorry for anybody. She 
had too many aches and pains 
and things generally wrong with 
her to worry about other people’s 
troubles. 

“A little,” he said. “Not much.” 
“The Monsters will hurt you 
much more if they catch you 
stealing from them, do you know 
that? They will hurt you much 
more than we ever could.” 

“I know. But the stealing is 
more important than the risk I’m 
taking. The stealing is the most 
important thing a man can do.” 

R ita the Record-Keeper 
nodded. “Because you steal 
things Mankind needs in order to 
live. You steal things that the Fe- 
male Society can make into food, 
clothing and weapons for Man- 
kind, so that Mankind can live 
and flourish.” 

He saw the way, saw what was 



expected of him. “No,” he contra- 
dicted her. “That’s not why we 
steal. We live on what we steal, 
but we do not steal just to go on 
living.” 

“Why?” she asked blandly, ^as 
if she didn’t know the answer bet- 
ter than any other member of the 
tribe. “Why do we steal? What is 
more important than survival?” 

Here it was now. The cate- 
chism. 

“To hit back at the Monsters,” 
he began. “To drive them from 
the planet, if we can. Regain 
Earth for Mankind, if we can. 
But, above all, hit back at the 
Monsters . .” 

He ploughed through the long 
verbal ritual, pausing at the end 
of each part, so that the Record- 
Keeper could ask the proper 
question and initiate the next se- 
quence. 

She tried to trip him once. She 
reversed the order of the fifth 
and sixth questions. Instead of 
“What will we do with the Mon- 
sters when we have regained the 
Earth from them?” she asked, 
“Why can’t we use the Mon- 
sters’ own Alien-Science to fight 
the Monsters?” 

Carried along by mental habit, 
Eric was well into the passage 
beginning “We will keep them as 
our ancestors kept all strange 
animals, in a place called a zoo, 
or we will drive them into our 
burrows and force them to live 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



21 



as ive have lived,” before he real- 
ized the switch and stopped in 
confusion. Then he got a grip on 
himself, sought the right answer 
in his memory with calmness, as 
his uncle’s wives had schooled 
him to do, and began again. 

“There are three reasons why 
we cannot ever use Alien-Sci- 
ence,” he recited, holding up his 
hand with the thumb and little 
finger closed. “Alien-Science is 
non-human, Alien-Science is in- 
human, Alien-Science is anti-hu- 
man. First, since it is non-human,” 
he closed his forefinger, “we can- 
not use it because we can never 
understand it. And because it is 
inhuman, we would never want 
to use it even if we could under- 
stand it. And because it is anti- 
human and can only be used to 
hurt and damage Mankind, we 
would not be able to use it so 
long as we remain human our- 
selves. Alien-Science is the op- 
posite of Ancestor-Science in 
every way, ugly instead of beauti- 
ful, hurtful instead of helpful. 
When we die, Alien-Science 
would not bring us to the world 
of our ancestors, but to another 
world full of Monsters.” 

A LL in all, it went very well, 
despite the trap into which 
he had almost fallen. 

But he couldn’t help remem- 
bering the conversation with his 
uncle in the other burrow. As his 



mouth reeled off the familiar 
words and concepts, his mind 
kept wondering how the two fit- 
ted together. Hs uncle was Alien- 
Science, and, according to his 
uncle, so had been his parents. 
Did that make them non-human, 
inhuman, anti-human? 

And what did it make him? He 
knew his religious duty well: he 
should at this moment be telling 
all Mankind about his uncle’s 
horrible secret. 

The whole subject was far too 
complicated for someone with his 
limited experience. 

When he had completed the 
lengthy catechism, Rita the Rec- 
ord-Keeper said: “And this is 
what you say about the science of 
our ancestors. Now we will find 
out what the science of our an- 
cestors says about you.” 

She signaled over her shoulder, 
without turning her head, and 
two young girls — female appren- 
tices — pulled forward the large 
record machine which was the 
very center of the tribe’s religious 
life. They stepped back, both 
smiling shyly and encouragingly 
at Eric the Only. 

He knew the smiles meant lit- 
tle more than simple best wishes 
from apprentices of one sex to 
apprentices of the other, but even 
that was quite a bit at the mo- 
ment. It meant that he was much 
closer to full status than they. It 
meant that, in the opinion of im- 



22 



GALAXY 



prejudiced, disinterested observ- 
ers, his examination was proceed- 
ing very well indeed. 

Singleton, he thought fiercely 
to himself. I’ll show them what a 
singleton can do! 

Rita the Record-Keeper turned 
a knob at the top of the squat 
machine and it began to hum. 
She flung her arms up, quivering- 
ly apart, and all, warriors, women, 
children, apprentices, even the 
chief himself, all bowed their 
heads. 

“Harken to the words of our 
ancestors,” she chanted. “Watch 
closely the spectacle of their great 
achievements. When their end 
was upon them, and they knew 
that only we, their descendants, 
might regain the Earth they had 
lost, they made this machine for 
the future generations of Man- 
kind as a guide to the science that 
once had been and must be 
again.” 

The old woman lowered her 
arms. Simultaneously, heads went 
up all over the burrow and stared 
expectantly at the wall opposite 
the record machine, waiting for 
the magic message. 

“Eric the Only,” Rita called, 
spinning the dial on the left of 
the machine with one hand and 
stabbing at it randomly with the 
forefinger of the other. “This is 
the sequence in the science of our 
ancestors that speaks for you 
alone. This is the appointed 



vision under which you will live 
and die.” 

TTE stared at the wall, breath- 
ing hard. Now he would find 
out what his life was to be about 
— now! His uncle’s vision at this 
moment, years ago, had suggested 
the nickname he came to bear: 
the Trap)-Smasher. At the last 
initiation ceremony, a youth had 
called forth a sequence in which 
two enormous airborne vehicles 
of the ancestors had collided. 

They’d tried to cheer the boy 
up, but he’d known his fate was 
upon him. Sure enough, he had 
been caught by a monster in the 
middle of his Theft and dashed 
to pieces against a wall. 

Even then, Eric decided, he’d 
rather have that kind of a se- 
quence than the awful emptiness 
of a blank vision. When, every 
once in a while, the machine went 
on and showed nothing but a 
blinding white rectangle, the 
whole tribe knew that the youth 
being examined had no possibility 
of manhood in him at all. And 
the machine was never wrong. A 
boy who’d drawn a blank vision 
inevitably became more and 
more effeminate as he grew older 
without ever going out on his 
Theft. He tended to shun the 
company of warriors and to ask 
the women for minor tasks to 
perform. The machine of the an- 
cestors looked at a boy and told 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



23 



exactly what he was and what he 
would become. 

It had been great, that science 
which had produced this machine, 
no doubt about it. There was a 
power source in it which was self- 
contained, and which was sup- 
posed to be like the power be- 
hind all things. It would run al- 
most forever, if the machine were 
not tampered with — although 
who could dream of tampering 
with it? In its visions were locked, 
not only the secrets of every in- 
dividual human being, but enor- 
mous mysteries which the whole 
of Mankind had to solve before it 
could work out its salvation 
through the rituals and powers of 
the ancestral science. 

Now, however, there was only 
one small part of Mankind that 
concerned Eric. Himself. His fu- 
ture. He waited, growing more 
and more tense as the power hum 
from the machine increased in 
pitch. And suddenly there was a 
grunt of awe from the entire bur- 
row of people as a vision was 
thrown upon the wall. 

He hadn’t drawn a blank. That 
was the most important thing. He 
had been given an authentic an- 
cestral vision. 

“Scattergood’s does it again!” 
a voice blared, as the picture pro- 
jected on the wall showed people 
coming from all directions, wear- 
ing the strange body wrappings 
of the ancestors. They rushed. 



men, women, children, from the 
four comers of the glittering 
screen to some strange stmcture 
in the center and disappeared 
into its entrance. More and more 
poured in, more and more kept 
materializing at the edges and 
scrambling toward the structure 
in the center. 

“Scattergood’s does it again!” 
the vision yelled out at them. 
“The sale of sales! The value of 
values! Only at Scattergood’s 
three stores tomorrow. Binocu- 
lars, tape recorders, cameras, all 
at tremendous reductions, many 
below cost. Value, value, value!” 

Now the vision showed only 
objects. Strange, unfamiliar ob- 
jects such as the ancestors used. 
And at each object appeared, the 
voice recited a charm over it. 
Powerful and ancient magic this, 
the forgotten lore of Ancestor- 
Science, 

“Krafft-Yahrmann Exposure 
Meters, the best there is, you’ve 
heard about them and now you

lars a week. The supply is limited, 
so hurry, hurry, hurry!” 

'C’RIC watched the sequence un- 
fold, his hands squeezing 
each other, his eyes almost dis- 
tended in reverence and concen- 
tration. This was the clue to his 
life, to what he might become. 
This was the sequence that the 
record machine of the ancestors, 
turned on at random, had vouch- 
safed as a prophecy of his future. 

All knowledge was in that ma- 
chine — and no possibility of 
error. 

But Eric was getting worried. 
The vision was so strange. Some- 
times there would be a vision 
that baffled even the wisest 
women. And that meant the 
youth who had called it forth 
would always be a puzzle, to him- 
self and all of Mankind. 

Let it not happen to him! O 
ancestors, O science, O record 
machine, let it not happen to 
him! 

Let him only have a clear and 
definite vision so that his per- 
sonality could be clear and defi- 
nite for the rest of his life! 

“Our special imported high- 
power precision binoculars,” the 
voice roared on as a man ap- 
peared in the vision and brought 
one of the strange objects up to 
his eyes. “If we told you the man- 
ufacturer’s name, you’d recognize 
it immediately. 7 x 50, only four- 



teen dollars and ninety-five cents, 
with case. 10 x 50, only fifteen 
dollars and ninety-five cents, with 
case. You see further, you see 
clearer, you pay less. You always 
pay less at Scattergood’s. Rock- 
bottom prices! Skyscraper values! 
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, 
at Scattergood’s annual week- 
after-Hallowe’en Sale!” 

There was a click as the vision 
went off abruptly to be replaced 
by a white rectangle on the wall 
of the burrow. Eric realized that 
this was all the clue there was to 
be to his life. What did it mean? 
Could it be interpreted? 

Anxiously, now, he turned to 
Ottilie, the Chieftain’s First Wife. 
He turned to her as everyone else 
in Mankind was now turning, 
Sarah the Sickness-Healer and 
Rita the Record-Keeper amongst 
them. 

Only Ottilie could read a vis- 
ion, only short, squat, imperious 
Ottilie. The Chieftain’s First Wife 
was her title of honor and her 
latest title, but long before she 
had acquired that, long before 
even she had become Head of the 
Female Society, she had been Ot- 
tilie the Augur, Ottilie the Omen- 
Teller, Ottilie who could walk in 
her mind from the homey burrow 
of the present into the dark, 
labyrinthine corridors of the fu- 
ture, Ottilie who could read signs, 
Ottilie who could announce por- 
tents.

GALAXY 



I T WAS as Ottilie the Augur 
that she could pick out the 
one new-born babe in a litter of 
three that had to be destroyed 
because, in some way or other, 
it would one day bring death to 
its people. It was as Ottilie the 
Augur that, upon the death of 
the old chief, she had chosen 
Franklin the Father of Many 
Thieves to take over the leader- 
ship of Mankind since he stimu- 
lated the most propitious omens. 
In everything she had been right. 
And now, once again it was as 
Ottilie the Augur that she threw 
her arms over her head and 
twisted and swayed and moaned 
as she sought deep inside her- 
self for the meaning of Eric’s vis- 
ion, it was as Ottilie the Augur 
and not as Ottilie the Chieftain’s 
First Wife, for that she had been 
only since Franklin had ascended 
the Throne Mound. 

The scratches and holes 
gouged in his body by Sarah the 
Sickness-Healer had begun to 
ache badly, but Eric shrugged off 
their annoyance. Could his vision 
be interpreted? And how would 
it be interpreted? 

Whatever Ottilie saw in the 
vision would stick to him for the 
rest of his life, much closer than 
the dried blood upon his arms 
and legs and chest. How could 
you possibly interpret such a vis- 
ion? Eric the Scattergood? That 
was meaningless. Eric the Value? 



No, that was a little better, but 
it was dreadfully vague, almost 
as bad as a blank vision. 

He stared past Ottilia’s writh- 
ing figure to where his uncle 
stood, surrounded by his band, 
a little to the left of the Throne 
Mound. Thomas the Trap-Smash- 
er was watching Ottilie and grin- 
ning with all his teeth. 

What did he find so funny, 
Eric wondered desperately? Was 
there nothing holy to him? Didn’t 
he realize how important it was 
to Eric’s future that his vision be 
readable, that he get a name to 
be proud of? What was fimny in 
Ottilia’s agony as she gave birth 
to Eric’s future? 

He realized that Ottilie was be- 
ginning to make coherent sounds. 
He strained his ears to listen. 
This, this was it. Who he really 
was. Who he would be, for all his 
life. 

“Three times,” Ottilie mumbled 
in a voice that steadily grew 
clearer and louder, “three times 
our ancestors gave Eric his name. 
Three repetitions they made. 
Three different ways they called 
on him to become what their 
science needed him to be. And 
all of you heard it, and I heard 
it, and Eric heard it too.” 

Which, Eric puzzled, which 
among the many strange magical 
statements had contained his 
name and his life’s-work? He 
waited for the Augur to come out 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



27 



with it. He had almost given up 
breathing. 

Her body relaxed now, her 
hands hanging at her sides, Ottilie 
was speaking to them in a sharp, 
authoritative voice as she stared 
at the wall of the burrow where 
the vision had appeared. 

“ ‘A light meter that’s an eye- 
opener,’ the ancestor-science 
said,” she reminded them. “And 
‘an electric eye that does all the 
focusing.’ And ‘you see further, 
you see clearer, you pay less,’ the 
Record-Machine told us of Eric. 
What the ancestors want of Eric 
is unmistakable, what he must be 
if we are to hit back at the Mon- 
sters and regain the Earth which 
is rightfully ours.” 

^HANK the record machine, 
thank each and every an- 
cestor! At least the message had 
been unmistakable. But what pre- 
cisely had it been? 

Ottilie the Augur, the Omen- 
Teller, turned to face him now 
where he stood apart from the 
rest of eagerly-watching Man- 
kind. He straightened up and 
stood stiffly to learn his fate. 

“Eric,” she said. “Eric the Only, 
Eric the Singleton, you go out 
now to make your Theft. If you 
are successful and return alive, 
you will become a man. And as 
a man you will no longer be Eric 
the Only, you will be Eric the 
Eye. Eric the Eye, Eric the Es- 



pier, Eric who seeks out the path 
for Mankind. Eric who hits back 
at the Monsters with his eye, his 
open eye, his electric eye, his 
further-seeing, clearer-seeing, less- 
paying eye. For this is the word 
of the ancestors, and all of you 
have heard it.” 

At last Eric could take a deep 
breath, and he did so now, noisily, 
in common with the whole of 
Mankind who had been hanging 
on Ottilie’s words. Eric the Eye 
— that was what he was to be. 
If he was successful . and if 
he lived. 

Eric the Eye. Eric the Espier. 
Now he knew about himself. It 
was fixed, and for all time. It 
was a good name to bear, a fine 
personality to have. He had been 
very fortunate. 

Rita the Record-Keeper and 
her daughter> Harriet the History- 
Teller, rolled the record machine 
back into its accustomed holy 
place, the niche in the wall be- 
hind the Throne Mound. Despite 
the sacred quality of the act in 
which she was engaged, the 
younger woman could not take 
her eyes off Eric. He was a person 
of consequence now, or at least 
would be when he returned. 
Other young and mating-aged 
women, he noticed, were looking 
at him the same way. 

He began to walk around in a 
little circle before Mankind, and, 
as he walked, he strutted. He 



28 



GALAXY 



waited until Ottilie, no longer the 
Augur now, no longer the Omen- 
Teller, but once more the Chief- 
tain’s First Wife — he waited un- 
til she had returned to her place 
at the head of the Female Soci- 
ety, before he began to sing. 

He threw back his head and 
spread out his arms and danced 
proudly, stampingly, before Man- 
kind. He spun around in great 
dizzying circles and leaped in the 
air and came down with wrench- 
ing spasmodic twists of his legs 
and arms. And as he danced, he 
sang. 

He sang out of the pride that 
racked his chest like a soul cough- 
ing, out of the majesty of the war- 
rior-that-was-to-be, out of his sure 
knowledge of self. And he sang 
his promise to his fellows: 

1 am Eric the Eye, 

Eric the Open Eye, 

Eric the Electric Eye, 

Eric the Further - Seeing, 
Clearer-Seeing, Less-Paying Eye. 

Eric the Espier — 

Eric who finds and points out 
the way. 

Are you lost in a strange place? 

I will show you the path to 
your home. 

Does the burrow break off in 
too many branches? 

I will pick out the best one and 
Mankind shall walk through in 
safety. 

Are there enemies about, hid- 
den traps, unthought-of dangers? 



I will see them and give warn- 
ing of them in time. 

I will walk at the head of the 
line of warriors and see for them, 

And they shall be confident 
and they shall conquer — 

For they have Eric the Espier 
to lead the way and point the 
path! 

QO he sang as he danced before 
^ Mankind, under the enor- 
mous glow lamps of its great cen- 
tral burrow. He sang of his mis- 
sion in life as just a few short 
auld lang synes ago he had heard 
Roy the Runner, at his initiation, 
sing of the fleetness and swiftness 
that he would soon be the master 
of; as his Uncle Thomas had sung 
long before that of his coming 
ability to detect and dismantle 
traps; as once his own father had 
sung of the robberies he was to 
commit, of the storerooms he 
would empty for the benefit of 
Mankind. He sang and he leaped 
and he whirled, and all the while 
the watching host of Mankind 
beat time with its feet and hands 
and played chorus in the litany 
of his triumph. 

Then came a loud grunt from 
Franklin the Father of Many 
Thieves. The noise stopped. Eric 
danced to a quivering halt, his 
body wet all over, his limbs still 
trembling. 

“That is what is to be,” Frank- 
lin pointed out, “once the Theft 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



29 



has been made. But first, first 
comes the Theft. Always before 
manhood comes the Theft. Now 
let us speak of your Theft.” 

“I will go into the very home 
of the Monsters,” Eric announced 
proudly, his head thrown back 
before the chief. “I will go into 
their home alone, with no com- 
panion but my own weapons, as a 
warrior should. I will steal from 
them, no matter what the danger, 
no matter what the threat. And 
what I steal, I will bring back for 
the use and enjoyment of Man- 
kind.” 

Franklin nodded and made the 
formal reply. “That is good, and 
it is spoken like a warrior. What 
do you promise to steal from the 
Monsters? For your first Theft 
must be a promise made in ad- 
vance and kept, kept exactly.” 

Now they were at it. Eric 
glanced at his uncle for support. 
Thomas the Trap-Smasher was 
staring off in a different direction. 
Eric licked his lips. Well, maybe 
it wouldn’t be too bad. After all, 
a youth going off on his first 
Theft had complete freedom of 
choice. 

“I promise to make my theft in 
the third category,” he said, his 
voice trembling just a little. 

The results were much more 
than he had anticipated. Franklin 
the Father of Many Thieves 
yelped sharply. He leaped off the 
Royal Mound and stood gaping 



at Eric for a while. His great 
belly and fat arms quivered with 
disbelief. 

“The third category, did you 
say? The third?” 

Eric, thoroughly frightened 
now, nodded. 

Franklin turned to Chief Wife 
Ottilie. They both peered through 
the ranks of Mankind to where 
Thomas the Trap-Smasher stood 
in the midst of his band, seem- 
ingly unconcerned by the sensa- 
tion that had just been created. 

“What is this, Thomas?” the 
chief demanded, all ceremony 
and formality gone from his 
speech. “What are you trying to 
pull? What’s this third category 
stuff you’re up to?” 

Thomas the Trap - Smasher 
turned a bland eye upon him. 
“What am I up to? I’m not up to 
a damn thing. The boy’s got a 
right to pick his category. If he 
wants to steal in the third cate- 
gory, well, that’s his business. 
What have I got to do with it?” 
The chief stared at him for a 
few moments longer. Then he 
swung back to Eric and said 
shortly: “All right. You’ve chosen. 
The third category it is. Now 
let’s get on with the feast.” 

SOMEHOW it was all spoiled 
^ for Eric. The initiation feast 
that preceded a first Theft — how 
he had looked forward to it! But 
he was apparently involved in 



30 



GALAXY 



something going on in Mankind, 
something dangerous and un- 
savory. 

The chief obviously considered 
him an important factor in what- 
ever difficulty had arisen. Usual- 
ly, an initiate about to depart on 
a Theft was the focus of all con- 
versation as Mankind ate in its 
central burrow, the women squat- 
ting on one side, the men on the 
other, the children at the far ends 
where light was dim. But at this 
meal, the chief made only the 
most necessary ritual remarks to 
Eric. His eyes kept wandering 
from him to Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher. 

Once in a while, Franklin’s 
eyes met those of Ottilie, his fa- 
vored and first wife, across the 
feast that had been spread the 
length of the burrow. He seemed 
to be saying something to her, 
although neither of them moved 
their lips. Then they would nod 
at each other and look back to 
Eric’s uncle. 

The rest of Mankind became 
aware of the strained atmos- 
phere: there was little of the 
usual laughter and gaiety of an 
initiation feast. The Trap- 
Smasher’s band had pulled in 
tightly all around him; most of 
them were not even bothering 
to eat but sat watchful and alert. 
Other band captains — men like 
Stephen the Strong-Armed and 
Harold the Hurler — had worried 



looks on their faces as if they 
were calculating highly complex 
problems. 

Even the children were re- 
markably quiet. They served the 
food over which the women had 
said charms much earlier, then 
scurried to their places and ate 
with wide eyes aimed at their 
elders. 

All in all, Eric was distinctly 
relieved when Franklin the Fa- 
ther of Many Thieves belched 
commandingly, stretched, and 
lay back on the floor of the bur- 
row. In a few minutes, he was 
asleep, snoring loudly. 

Night had officially begun. 

IV 

A T the end of the sleep period, 
as soon as the chief had 
awakened and yawned, thus pro- 
claiming the dawn, Thomas the 
Trap-Smasher’s band started on 
its trip. 

Eric, still officially surnamed 
the Only, carried the precious 
loin straps of manhood in the 
food knapsack the women had 
provided for a possible journey 
of several days. They should re- 
turn before the next sleep period, 
but when one went on an expedi- 
tion into Monster territory any- 
thing might happen. 

They stepped out in full mili- 
tary formation, a long, straggling 
single file, each man barely in

sight of the warrior immediately 
ahead. For the first time in his 
military career, Eric was wearing 
only one set of spears — those 
for himself. Extra weapons for 
the band — as well as extra sup- 
plies — were on the back of a 
new apprentice, a stripling who 
marched a distance behind Eric, 
watching him with the same mix- 
ture of fright and exhilaration 
Eric himself had once accorded 
all other warriors. 

Ahead of Eric, momentarily 
disappearing as the dim corridor 
curved and branched, was Roy 
the Runner, his long, loose-jointed 
legs purposefully treading down 
the mileage. And all the way in 
the lead of the column, Eric 
knew, was his uncle. Thomas the 
Trap-Smasher would be striding 
cautiously yet without any un- 
necessary waste of time, the large 
glow lamp on his forehead con- 
stantly shifting from wall to wall 
of the uninhabited burrow and 
then straight ahead, the heavy 
spear in each brawny hand ready 
for instant action, his mouth set 
to call the warning behind him if 
danger materialized. 

To be a man — this was what 
it was like! To go on expeditions 
like this for the rest of one’s life, 
glorious, adventure-charged ex- 
peditions so that Mankind might 
eat well and have weapons and 
live as Mankind should. And 
when you returned, triumphant. 



victorious, the welcoming dance 
of the women as they threaded 
their way through the tired ranks, 
giving you refreshment and tak- 
ing from you the supplies that 
only they could turn into usable 
articles. Then, after you had 
eaten and drunk and rested, your 
own dance, the dance of the men, 
where you sang and acted out 
for the tribe all the events of 
this particular expedition, the 
dangers you had overcome, the 
splendid courage you had shown, 
the strange and mysterious sights 
you had seen. 

The sights you had seen! As 
Eric the Eye, he would probably 
be entitled to a solo dance any 
time his band came across any- 
thing particularly curious. Oh, 
how high Eric the Eye would 
leap, how loudly, how proudly, 
how melodiously, he would sing 
of the wonders the expedition 
had encountered! 

“Eric the Eye,” the women 
would murmur. “What a fine, fine 
figure of a man! What a mate for 
some lucky woman!” 

TTARRIET the History-Teller 
this morning, for example, 
before they started out. She had 
filled his canteen for him with 
fresh water as if he were already 
an accredited man instead of an 
initiate going out to face his ulti- 
mate trial. Before the eyes of all 
Mankind she had filled it and 



32 



GALAXY 



brought it to him, her eyes down- 
cast and light purple blushes on 
the rosy skin of her face and 
body. She had treated him the 
way a wife treats a husband, and 
many warriors — Eric thought 
gleefully — many full warriors 
with their Thefts long behind 
them had observed that Eric was 
likely to join the ranks of the 
Male Society and the married 
men almost simultaneously. 

Of course, with her unlucky 
red hair, her bustling, domineer- 
ing mother, Harriet was not ex- 
actly the most marriageable girl 
in Mankind. Still, there were 
many full warriors who had not 
yet been able to persuade a 
woman to mate with them, who 
watched Franklin and his three 
wives with unconcealed hunger 
and envy. How they would envy 
Eric, the newest warror of all, 
when he mated the same night he 
returned from his theft! Call him 
Only, then! Call him singleton, 
then! 

They would have litter after 
litter, he and Harriet, large litters, 
ample litters, four, five, even six 
at a time. People would forget 
he’d ever been the product of a 
singleton birth. Other women, 
mates of other warriors, would 
wriggle to attract his attention as 
they now_ wriggled when they 
caught the eye of Franklin the 
Father of Many Thieves. He 
would make the litters fathered 



by Franklin look puny in com- 
parison, he would prove that the 
best hope for Mankind’s increase 
lay in his loins and his loins alone. 
And when the time came to se- 
lect another chief . 

“Hey, you damned day-dream- 
ing singleton!” Roy the Runner 
was calling from the burrow 
ahead. “Will you wipe that haze 
out of your face and pay atten- 
tion to signals? This is an expedi- 
tion to Monster territory, not a 
stroll in the women’s quarters. 
Stay alert, will you? The band 
captain’s sent down a call for 
you.” 

Amid the chuckles ahead and 
behind him — damn it, even the 
new apprentice was laughing! — 
Eric took a firmer grip on his 
glow torch and sprinted for the 
head of the column. As he passed 
each man, he was asked the name 
of the girl he’d been thinking 
about and pressed for interesting 
details. Since he kept his mouth 
tightly shut, some of the warriors 
hypothesized out loud. They were 
painfully close to the truth. 

His uncle wasn’t much gentler 
with him. “Eric the Eye!” the 
Trap-Smasher growled. “Eric the 
Eyebrow, Eric the Closed Eye- 
lash, you’ll be known as, if you 
don’t wake up! Now stay abreast 
of me and try to act like Eric the 
Eye. These are dangerous bur- 
rows and my vision isn’t as sharp 
as yours. Besides, I have to fill 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS

you in on a couple of things.” He 
turned. “Spread out a little far- 
ther back there,” he called out 
to the men behind him. “Spread 
out! You should be a full spear- 
cast from the backside of the man 
in front of you. Let me see a real 
strung-out column with plenty 
of distance between each war- 
rior.” 

Eric, he muttered, once the 
maneuver had been com- 
pleted: “Good. Gives us a chance 
to talk without everyone in the 
band hearing us. You can trust 
my bunch, but still, why take 
chances?” 

Eric nodded, with no idea what 
he was talking about. His uncle 
had become slightly odd re- 
cently. Well, he was still the best 
band captain in all Mankind. 

They marched along together, 
the light from the strange glow- 
ing substance on Eric’s torch and 
his uncle’s forehead spreading a 
yellowish illumination some hun- 
dred feet ahead of them. On ei- 
ther side, underfoot, overhead, 
were the curved, featureless walls 
of the burrow. From the center 
of the corridor, where they 
inarched, the walls looked soft 
and spongy, but Eric knew what 
tremendous labor was involved 
in digging a niche or recess in 
them. It took several strong men 
at least two sleep periods to make 
a niche large enough to hold a 



handful of Mankind’s store of 
artifacts. 

Where had the burrows come 
from? Some said they had been 
dug by the ancestors when they 
had first begun to hit back at the 
Monsters. Others claimed the 
burrows had always been there, 
waiting for Mankind to find them 
and be comfortable in them. 

In all directions the burrows 
stretched. On and on they went, 
interminably curving and branch- 
ing and forking, dark and silent, 
until human beings stamped into 
them with glow lamp and glow 
torch. These particular corridors, 
Eric knew, led to Monster terri- 
tory. He had been along them 
many times as a humble spear 
carrier when his uncle’s band had 
been dispatched to bring back the 
necessities of life for Mankind. 
Other corridors went off to more 
exotic and even more dangerous 
places. But were there any places 
which had no burrows? 

What a thought! Even the 
Monsters lived in burrows, big 
as they were reputed to be. But 
there was a legend that Mankind 
had once lived outside burrows, 
outside the branching corridors. 
Then what had they lived in? 
Just trying to work it out made 
you dizzy. 

They came to a place where 
the burrow became two burrows, 
each curving away from the other 
in opposite directions. 



f 

“Which one?” his uncle de- 
manded. 

Eric unhesitatingly pointed the 

right. 

Thomas the Trap-Smasher 
nodded. “You have a good mem- 
ory,” he said as he bore in the 
direction that Eric had indicated. 
“That’s half of being an Eye. The 
other half is having a feeling, a 
knack, for the right way to go. 
You have that too. I’ve noticed 
it on every expedition where 
you’ve been along. That’s what 
I told those women — Rita, Ot- 
tilie — I told them what your 
name had to be. Eric the Eye, I 
told them. Find a vision for the 
kind that corresponds to it.” 

H e was so shocked that he al- 
most came to a halt. “You 
picked my name? You told them 
what kind of vision . That’s — 
that’s — I never heard of such 
a thing!” 

His uncle laughed. “It’s no dif- 
ferent from Ottilie the Omen- 
Teller making a deal with Frank- 
lin to have a vision showing him 
as the new chief. He gets to be 
chief, she becomes the Chief- 
tain’s First Wife and automati- 
cally takes over the Female So- 
ciety. Religion and politics, 
they’re always mixed up together 
these days, Eric. We’re not living 
in the old times any more when 
Ancestor-science was real and 
holy and it worked.” 



“It still works. Ancestor-sci- 
ence, doesn’t it?” he pleaded. 
“Some of the tme?” 

“Everything works some of the 
time. Only Alien-science, though, 
works all of the time. It’s work- 
ing for Aliens, for the Monsters. 
It’s got to begin working for us. 
That’s where you come in.” 

He had to remember that his 
uncle was an experienced cap- 
tain, a knowledgeable warrior. 
Thomas the Trap-Smasher’s pro- 
tection and advice had brought 
him, a despised singleton, an 
orphaned child of parents that no 
one dared even talk about, to his 
present estate of almost full 
thieving status. It was very for- 
tunate for him that neither of 
his uncle’s wives had yet pro- 
duced a son which survived into 
the initiate years. He still had a 
lot to learn from this man. 

“Now,” the Trap-Smasher was 
saying, his eyes still on the dimly 
illuminated corridors ahead. 
“When we get to the Monster 
burrows, you go in. You go in 
alone, of course.” 

Well, of course, Eric thought. 
What other way was there to 
make your Theft? The first time 
you stole for Mankind, you did 
it all alone, to prove your man- 
hood, your courage, also the 
amount of personal luck you en- 
joyed. It was not like a regular 
band theft — or organized steal- 
ing of a large amount of goods 



34 



GALAXY 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



35 






that would last Mankind many 
sleep-periods, almost a tenth of 
an auld lang syne. In a regular 
band theft, assigned to each band 
in rotation, a warrior had to be 
assured of the luck and skill of 
the warriors at his side. He had 
to know that each one of them 
had made his Theft — and proved 
himself when completely alone. 

Stealing from the Monsters 
was dangerous enough under the 
best of conditions. You wanted 
only the cleverest, bravest, most 
fortunate warriors along with 
you. 

“Once you’re inside, stay close 
to the wall. Don’t look up at first 
or you’re likely to freeze right 
where you are. Keep your eyes 
on the wall and move close to it. 
Move fast.” 

Nothing new here. Every ini- 
tiate learned over and over again, 
before he made his Theft, that 
it was terribly dangerous to look 
up when you first entered Mon- 
ster territory. You had to keep 
your eyes on the wall and move 
in the protection of it, the wall 
touching your shoulder as you 
ran alongside it. Why this was so, 
Eric had no idea, but that it was 
so he had long ago learned to 
repeat as a fact. 

“All right,” Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher went on. “You turn right 
as you go in. Right, do you hear 
me, Eric? You turn right, with- 
out looking up, and run along 



the wall, letting it brush your 
shoulder every couple of steps. 
You run forty, fifty paces, and ' 
you come to a great big thing, a 
structure, that’s almost touching 
the wall. You turn left along 
that, moving away from the wall, ' 
but still not looking up, until you 
pass an entrance in the structure. 
You don’t go in that first en- 
trance, Eric; you pass it by. 
About twenty, twenty-five paces 
further on, there’ll be a second 
entrance, a bigger one. You go 
in that one.” 

“I go in that one,” Eric re- 
peated carefully, memorizing his 
uncle’s words. He was receiving 
directions for his Theft, the most 
important act of his life! Every 
single thing his uncle told him 
must be listened to carefully, 
must not be forgotten. 

“You’ll be in something that 
looks like a burrow again, but 
it’ll be darker, at first. The walls 
will soak up light from your glow 
lamp. After a while, the burrow 
will open out into a great big 
space, a real big and real dark 
space. Y ou go on in a straight ' 
line, looking over your shoulder 
at the light from the entrance 
and making sure it’s always di- 
rectly behind you. You’ll hit an- 
other burrow, a low one this time. 
Turn right at the first fork as 
soon as you go in, and there you 
are.” 

“Where? Where will I be? 



What happens then?” Eric de- 
manded eagerly. “How do I make 
my Theft? Where do I find the 
third category?” 

Thomas the Trap*-Smasher 
seemed to have trouble continu- 
ing. Incredible — he was actually 
nervous! “There’ll be a Stranger 
there. You tell him who you are, 
your name. He’ll do the rest.” 

T his time Eric came to a full 
stop. “A Stranger?” he asked 
in complete amazement. “Some- 
one who’s not of Mankind?” 

His uncle grabbed at his arm 
and pulled him along. “Well, 
you’ve seen Strangers before,” he 
said with a weak laugh. “You 
know there are others in the bur- 
rows besides Mankind. You know 
that, don’t you, boy?” 

Eric certainly did. 

From an early age he had ac- 
companied his uncle and his un- 
cle’s band on warfare and trading 
expeditions to the burrows a bit 
further back. He knew that the 
people in these burrows looked 
down on the people in his, that 
they were more plentiful than 
his people, and led richer, safer 
lives — but he still couldn’t help 
feeling sorry for them. 

They were nothing but Stran- 
gers, after all. He was a member 
of Mankind. 

It wasn’t just that Mankind 
lived in the front burrows, those 
closest to the Monster larder. 



This enormous convenience 
might be counterbalanced, he 
would readily admit, by the dan- 
gers associated with it — although 
the constant exposure to dangers 
and death in every form were 
part of Mankind’s greatness. 
They were great despite their 
inferior technology. So what if 
they were primarily a source of 
raw materials to the more popu- 
lous but less hardy burrows in 
the rear? How long would the 
weaponsmiths, the potters and 
tanners and artificers of these 
burrows be able to go on with 
their buzzing, noisy industries 
once Mankind ceased to bring 
them the basic substances — 
food, cloth, metal — it had so 
gloriously stolen from fear-filled 
Monster territory? No, Man- 
kind was the bravest, greatest, 
most important people in all the 
burrows. 

But that still wasn’t the point, 
of it all. 

The point was that you had 
nothing more to do with Stran- 
gers than was absolutely neces- 
sary. They were Strangers. You 
were Mankind. You stayed 
proudly aloof from them at all 
times. 

Trading with them — well, 
you traded with them. Mankind 
needed spear-points and sturdy 
spear-shifts, knapsacks and loin- 
straps, canteens and cooking ves- 
sels. You needed these articles 



36 



GALAXY 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



37 



r 



and got them in exchange for 
heavy backloads of shapeless, un- 
processed stuff freshly stolen. 
Mating with them — well, of 
course you mated with them. One 
was always on the lookout for 
extra women who could add to 
the knowledge and technical 
abilities of Mankind. But these 
women became a well-adjusted 
part of Mankind once they were 
stolen, just as Mankind’s women 
were complete outsiders and 
Strangers the moment they had 
been carried off by a foreign raid- 
ing party. And fighting with them, 
warring with them — next to 
stealing from the Monsters, that 
was the sweetest, most exciting 
part of a warrior’s existence. 

You traded with Strangers, 
coldly, suspiciously, always alert 
for a better bargain; you stole 
Stranger women whenever you 
could, gleefully, proudly, because 
that diminished them and in- 
creased the numbers and well- 
being of Mankind; and you 
fought Stranger men whenever 
there was more to be gained that 
way than by simple trading — 
and periodically they came upon 
you as you lay in your burrow 
unawares and fought you. 

But otherwise, for all normal 
social purposes, they were taboo. 
Almost as taboo and not-to-be- 
related-to as the Monsters on 
the other side of Mankind’s bur- 
rows. When you came upon an 



individual Stranger wandering 
apart from his people, you killed 
him quickly and casually. 

You certainly didn’t ask him 
for advice on your Theft. 

"I^RIC was still brooding on the 
unprecedented nature of his 
uncle’s instructions when they 
came to the end of their journey, 
a large, blind-alley burrow. There 
was a line cut deep into the blank 
wall here, a line that started at 
the floor, went up almost to the 
height of a man’s head, and then 
curved down to the floor again. 

The door to Monster territory. 

Thomas the Trap-Smasher 
waited for a moment, listening. 
When his experienced ears had 
detected no unusual noises in the 
neighborhood, no hint of danger 
on the other side, he cupped his 
hands around his mouth, faced 
back the way he had come, and 
softly gave the ululating recogni- 
tion-call of the band. The four 
other warriors and the appren- 
tice came up swiftly and grouped 
themselves about him. Then, at 
a signal from their leader, all | 
squatted near the door. 

They ate first, rapidly and si- | 
lently, removing from their knap- i 
sacks handfuls of food that the i 
women had prepared for them 
and stuffing their mouths full, the j 
beams from the glow lamps 
above their eyes darting inces- i 
santly back and forth along the 



38 



GALAXY 




arched, empty corridor. This was 
the place of ultimate, awful dan- 
ger. This was the place where 
anything might happen. 

Eric ate most sparingly of all 
as was correct for an initiate 
about to emerge upon his Theft. 
He knew he had to keep his 
springiness of body and watch- 
fulness of mind at their highest 
possible pitch. He saw his uncle 
nodding approvingly as he re- 
turned the bulk of his food to 
the knapsack. 

The floor vibrated slightly un- 
derfoot; there was a regular, 
rhythmic gurgling. Eric knew 
that meant they were directly 
over a length of Monster plumb- 
ing: upon his return, before the 
band started homewards, Tho- 
mas the Trap-Smasher would 
make an opening in the plumbing 
and they would refill their can- 
teens. The water here, nearest to 
Monster territory, was always 
the sweetest and best. 

Now his uncle got to his feet 
and called Roy the Runner to 
him. While the other warriors 
watched, tense and still, the two 
men walked to the curved line 
and laid their ears against it. 
Satisfied, finally, they inserted 
spear points into the door’s out- 
line on either side and carefully 
pried the slab back toward them. 
They laid it on the floor of the 
corridor, very gently. 

A shimmering blur of pure 



whiteness appeared where the 
door had been. 

Monster territory. The strange, 
alien light of Monster territory. 
Eric had seen many warriors dis- 
appear into it to fulfill their man- 
hood tasks. Now it was his turn. 

Holding his heavy spear at the 
ready, Eric’s uncle leaned for- 
ward into the whiteness. His body 
twisted as he looked up, down, 
around, on both sides. He with- 
drew and came back into the | 
burrow. j 

“No new traps,” he said in a ^ 
soft voice. “The one I dismantled 
last expedition is still up there i 
on the wall. It hasn’t been re- i 
paired. Now Eric. Here you go, 
boy.” 

Eric rose and walked with him ; 
to the doorway, remembering to 
keep his eyes on the floor. You 
can’t look up, he had been told 
again and again, not right away, i 
not the first time you’re in Mon- 
ster territory. If you do, you ■ 
freeze, you’re lost, you’re done 
for completely. 

His uncle checked him care- 
fully and fondly, making certain 
that his new loin straps were 
tight, that his knapsack and back- 
sling were both in the right posi- 
tion on his shoulders. He took 
a heavy spear from Eric’s right 
hand and replaced it with a light : 
one from the back-sling. “If you’re j 
seen by a Monster,” he whis- 
pered, “the heavy spear’s not 



40 



GALAXY 



worth a damn. You scuttle into 
closest hiding-place and 
throw the light spear as far as 
you can. The Monster can’t dis- 
tinguish between you and the 
spear. It will follow the spear.” 
Eric nodded mechanically, al- 
though this too he had been told 
many times, this too was a lesson 
he knew by heart. His mouth was 
so dry! He wished that it weren’t 
unmanly to beg for water at such 
a moment. 

Thomas the Trap-Smasher 
took his torch from him and 
slipped a glow lamp about his 
forehead. Then he pushed him 
through the doorway. “Go make 
your Theft, Eric,” he whispered. 
“Come back a man.” 

V 

H e was on the other side. He 
was in Monster territory. 
He was surrounded by the strange 
Monster light, the incredible 
Monster world. The burrows. 
Mankind, everything familiar, 
lay behind him. 

Panic rose from his stomach 
and into his throat like vomit. 

Don’t look up. Eyes down, 
eyes down or yotfre likely to 
freeze ri^ht where you are. Stay 
close to the wall, keep your eyes 
on the wall and move along it. 
Turn right and move along the 
wall. Move fast. 

Eric turned. He felt the wall 

THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



brush his right shoulder. He be- 
gan to rim, keeping his eyes 
down, touching the wall with his 
shoulder at regular intervals. He 
ran as fast as he possibly could, 
urging his muscles fiercely on. As 
he ran, he counted the steps to 
himself. '• 

Twenty paces. Where did the 
light come from? It was every- 
where; it glowed so; it was white, 
white. Twenty-five paces. Touch 
the wall with your shoulder. 
Don’t — above everything — 
don’t wander away from the wall. 
Thirty paces. In light like this 
you had no need of the glow 
lamp. It was almost too bright 
to see in. Thirty- five paces. The 
floor was not like a burrow floor. 
It was flat and very hard. So was 
the wall. Flat and hard and 
straight. Forty paces. Run and 
keep your eyes down. Run. Keep 
touching the wall with your 
shoulder. Move fast. But keep 
your eyes down. Don’t look up. 
Forty -five paces. 

He almost smashed into the 
structure he had been told about, 
but his reflexes and the warnings 
he had received swung him to the 
left and along it just in time. It 
was a different color than the 
wall, he noted, and a different- 
textured material. Keep your 
eyes down. Don’t look up. He 
came to an entrance, like the 
beginning of a small burrow. 

Don’t go in that first entrance. 



41 



Eric; you pass it by. He began to 
count again as he ran. Twenty- 
three paces more, and there was 
another entrance, a much higher, 
wider one. He darted inside. It’ll 
be darker, at first. The walls will 
soak up light from your glow 
lamp. 

Eric paused, gasping. He was 
grateful for the sucking darkness. 
After that terrible, alien white 
light, the gloom was friendly, 
reminiscent of the familiar bur- 
rows now so horribly far away. 

He could afford to take a 
breath at this point, he knew. The 
first, the worst part was over. He 
wasn’t out in the open any more. 

He had emerged into Mon- 
ster territory. He had run fast, 
following instructions until he 
was safely under cover again. He 
was still alive. 

The worst was over. Nothing 
else would be as bad as this. 

Monster territory. It lay be- 
hind him, bathed in its own pe- 
culiar light. Now. Why not? 
Now, when he was in a place of 
comparative safety. He could 
take a chance. He wanted to take 
a chance. 

He turned, gingerly, fearfully. 
He raised his eyes. He looked. 

^^HE cry that tore from his lips 
-*■ was completely involuntary 
and frightened him almost as 
much as what he saw. He shut 
his eyes and threw himself down 

42 



and sideways. He lay where he 
had fallen for a long while, al- 
most paralyzed. 

It couldn’t be. He hadn’t seen 
it. Nothing was that high, nothing 
ran on and on for such incredi- 
ble distances! 

After a time, he opened his 
eyes again, keeping them care- 
fully focused on the dark near 
him. The gloom in this covered 
place had diminished somewhat 
as his eyes had grown more ac- 
customed to it. Yellowish light 
from his glow lamp was providing 
illumination now: he could make 
out the walls, about as far apart 
from each other as those in a bur- 
row, but — unlike a burrow’s 
walls — oddly straight and at 
right angles to the floor and ceil- 
ing. Far off there was an im- 
mense patch of darkness. The 
burrow will open out into a great 
big space, a real big and real dark 
space. 

What was this place, he won- 
dered? What was it to the Mon- 
sters? 

He had to take another look 
behind, into the open. One more 
quick look. He was going to be 
Eric the Eye. An Eye should be 
able tb look at anything. He had 
to take another look. 

But guardedly, guardedly. 

Eric turned again, opening his 
eyes a little at a time. He clamped 
his teeth together so as not to cry 
out. Even so, he almost did. He 

GALAXY 



L 



shut his eyes quickly, waited, 
then opened them again. 

Bit by bit, effort by effort, he 
found he was able to look into 
the great open whiteness without 
losing control of himself. It was 
upsetting, overpowering, but if 
he didn’t look too long at any 
one time, he could stand it. 

Distance. Enormous, elongated, 
unbelievable distance. Space 
upon space upon space — that 
white light bathing it all. Space 
far ahead, space on all sides, 
space going on and on until it 
seemed to have no end to it at 
all. But there, fantastically far 
off, there was an end. There was 
a wall, a wall made by giants 
that finally sealed off the tremen- 
dous space. It rose hugely from 
the flat, huge floor and disap- 
peared somewhere far overhead. 

And in between — once you 
could stand to look at it this much 
— in between, there were ob- 
jects. Enormous objects, dwarfed 
only by the greatness of the space 
which surrounded them, enor- 
mous, terribly alien objects. Ob- 
jects like nothing you had ever 
imagined. 

1^0, that wasn’t quite true. That 

' thing over there. Eric recog- 
nized it. 

A great, squat thing like a full 
knapsack without the straps. 
Since early boyhood, many was 
the time he had heard it de- 



scribed by warriors back from an 
expedition into Monster territory. 

There was food in that sack 
and the others like it. Enough 
food in that one sack to feed the 
entire population of Mankind for 
unnumbered auld lang synes. A 
different kind of food in each 
sack. 

No sp)ear point possessed by 
Mankind would cut through the 
fabric of its container, not near 
the bottom where it was thickest. 
Warriors had to climb about half- 
way up the sack, Eric knew, be- 
fore they could find a place thin 
enough to carve themselves an 
entrance. Then the lumps of food 
would be lowered from man to 
man all the way down the sack, 
warriors clinging to precarious 
handholds every few paces. 

Once the pile on the floor was 
great enough, they would clam- 
ber down and fill their specially 
large, food-expedition knapsacks. 
Then back to the burrows and to 
the women who alone possessed 
the lore of determining whether 
the food was fit for consumption 
and of preparing it if it were. 

That’s where he would be at 
this moment, on that sack, cut- 
ting a hole in it, if he’d chosen a 
first category Theft like most 
other youths. He’d be cutting a 
hole, scooping out a handful of 
food — any quantity, no matter 
how small, was acceptable on an 
initiatory Theft — and ie pre- 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



43 



paring to go home to plaudits 
from the women and acceptance 
from the men. He’d be engaged 
in a normal, socially-acceptable 
endeavor. 

Instead of which . 

He found that he was able to 
stare at the Monster room now 
from under the cover of his hiding 
place with only a slight feeling 
of nausea. Well, that in itself was 
an achievement. After only a 
short time, here he was, able to 
look around and estimate the na- 
ture of Monster goods like the 
most experienced warrior. He 
couldn’t look up too high as yet, 
but what warrior could? 

Well and good, but this wasn’t 
getting him anywhere. He didn’t 
have a normal Theft to make. 
His was third category. Monster 
souvenirs. 

Eric turned and faced the dark- 
ness again. He walked rapidly 
forward into the straight-walled 
burrow, the glow-lamp on his 
forehead lighting a yellow path. 
Ahead of him, the great black 
space grew steadily larger as he 
pushed towards it. 

Everything about his Theft, 
his initiation into manhood, was 
extraordinary. Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher telling the women about 
his special talents, so that he 
would be accorded a vision and 
a name which would fit with 
them. Visions were supposed to 
come from the ancestors, through 



the ancestor-science of the record 
machine. Nobody was supposed 
to have the slightest idea in ad- 
vance of what the vision would 
be. That was all up to the an- 
cestors and their mysterious 
plans for their descendants. 

^^ETAS it possible, was it con- 
” ceivable, that all visions 
and names were pre-arranged, 
that the record machine was set 
in advance for every initiation? 
Where did that leave religion? 
If that were so, how could you 
continue to believe in logic, in 
cause and effect? 

And having someone — a 
Stranger, at that! — help you 
make your Theft. A Theft was 
supposed to be purely and simply 
a test of your male potential; by 
definition, it was something you 
did alone. i 

But if you could accept the 
concept of pre-arranged visions, 
why not pre-arranged Thefts? 1 
Eric shook his head. He was | 
getting into very dark corridors 
mentally: his world was turning 
into sheer confusion. 

But one thing he knew. Mak- 
ing an arrangement with a 
Stranger, as his uncle had done, 
was definitely an act contrary to 
all the laws and practices of 
Mankind. Thomas’s uncertain i 
speech had underlined that fact. 
It was — well, it was wron^. 

Yet his uncle was the greatest 



man in all Mankind, so far as 
Eric was concerned. Thomas the 
Trap-Smasher could do no wrong. 
But Thomas the Trap-Smasher 
was evidently leaning toward 
Alien-science.- Alien-science was 
wrong. But again, on the other 
hand, his parents, according to 
the Trap-Smasher, his father and 
his mother had been Alien-sci- 
encers. 

Too much. There was just too 
much to work out. There was 
too much he didn’t know. He’d 
better concentrate on his Theft. 

The strange burrow had come 
to an end. The hairs rose on the 
back of his neck as he walked 
into the great dark area and 
sensed enormous black heights 
above him. He began to hurry, 
turning every once in a while to 
make certain that he was staying 
in a straight line with the light 
from the entrance. Here, his fore- 
head glow lamp was almost no 
use at all. He didn’t like this 
place. It felt almost like being 
out in the open. 

What, he wondered again fev- 
erishly, was this structure in the 
world of the Monsters? What 
function did it have? He was 
not sure he wanted to know. 

Eric was running by the time 
he came to the end of the open 
space. He hit the wall so hard 
that he was knocked over back- 
wards. 

For a moment, he was badly 



frightened, then he realized what 
had happened. He hadn’t taken 
his bearings for a while: he must 
have moved off at an angle. 

Groping along the wall with ex- 
tended arms, he found the en- 
trance to the low burrow at last. 
It was quite low — he had to 
bend his knees and duck his head 
as he went up to. It was an un- 
pleasantly narrow little corridor. 
But then there was an opening 
on his right — the fork his uncle 
had told him about — and he 
turned into it with relief. 

He had arrived. 

There was a burst of light from 
a group of glow lamps. And there 
were Strangers, there were sev- 
eral Strangers here. Three of 
them — no, four — no, five! 
They squatted in a corner of this 
large, square burrow, three of 
them talking earnestly, the other 
two engaged in some incompre- 
hensible task with materials that 
were mostly unfamiliar. 

A LL OF them leaped to their 
feet as he trotted in and 
deployed instantly in a wide 
semi-circle facing him. Eric 
wished desperately he had been 
holding two heavy spears instead 
of the single light one. With two 
heavy spears you had both a 
shield and a dangerous offensive 
weapon. A light spear was good 
for a single cast, and that was 
that. 



44

THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



45 



He held it nevertheless in the 
throwing position above his 
shoulder and glared fiercely, as 
a warrior of Mankind should. If 
he had to throw, he decided, he 
would spring to one side immedi- 
ately afterward and try to pluck 
the two heavy spears from ■ his 
backsling. But if they rushed him 
right now — 

“Who are you?” asked a 
strong-faced, middle-aged man in 
the center of the semi-circle, his 
spear throbbing in an upraised 
arm. “What’s your name — 
what’s your people?” 

“Eric the Only,” Eric told him 
quickly. Then he remembered to 
add: “I’m destined to be Eric the 
Eye. My people are Mankind.” 
“He’s expected, one of us,” the 
middle-aged man told the others 
who immediately relaxed, slung 
their spears and went back to 
what they had been doing. ‘Wel- 
come, Eric the Only of Mankind. 
Put up your spear and sit with 
us. I am Arthur the Organizer.” 
Eric gingerly dropped his 
spear into the back-sling. He 
studied the Stranger. 

A man about as old as his 
uncle and not nearly as hefty, 
although well-muscled enough 
for normal warlike purposes. He 
wore the loin-straps of a full war- 
rior, but — as if these were not 
enough honor for a man — he 
also wore straps laced about his 
chest and across his shoulders. 



though he was carrying no knap>- 
sack. This was the fashion of | 
many Strangers, Eric knew, as j 
was the strap at the back of the 
head that held the hair in a tight 
tail away from the eyes instead 
of letting it hang wild and free ! 
as the hair of a warrior should. 
And the straps were decorated 
with odd, incised designs — an- 
other weak and unmanlike 1 
Stranger fashion. 

Who but Strangers, Eric 
thought contemptuously, would 
group up so in an alien place 
without setting sentries at either 
end of their burrow? Truly Man- 
kind had good reason to despise 
them! 

But this man was a leader, he 
realized, a bom leader, with an ; 
even more self-assured air than 
Thomas the Trap-Smasher, cap- ; 
tain of the best band in all Man- 
kind. He was studying Eric in 
turn, with eyes that weighed 
carefully and then, having de- 
cided on the measure, made a 
definite placement, fitting Eric 
permanently into this plan or 
that plan. He looked like a man i 
whose head was full of many 
plans, each one evolving inexor- 
ably through action to a pre- 
determined end. 

He took Eric’s arm companion- 
ably and led him to where the 
others squatted and talked and 
worked. This was no tribal bur- ■ 
row of any sort: it was quite ap-

parently a field headquarters — 
and Arthur the Organizer was 
Commander-in-Chief. “I met your 
uncle,” he told Eric, “about a 
dozen auld lang synes ago, when 
he came to us on a trading ex- 
pedition — back in our burrows, 
I mean. A fine man, your uncle, 
very progressive. He’s attended 
our secret meetings regularly, 
and there’s going to be an im- 
portant place for him in the great 
burrows we will dig, in the new 
world we are making. He re- 
minds me a lot of your father. 
But so do you, my boy, so do 
you.” 

“Did you know my father?” 

A rthur the Organizer smiled 
and nodded. “Very well. He 
could have been a great man. He 
gave his life for the Cause. Who 
among us will ever forget Eric 
the — the — Eric the Store- 
keeper or something, wasn’t it?” 
“The Storeroom-Stormer. His 
name was Eric the Storeroom- 
Stormer.” 

“Yes, of course. Eric the Store- 
room-Stormer. An unforgettable 
name with us, and an unforget- 
table man. But that’s another 
story; we’ll talk about it some 
other time. You’ll have to be get- 
ting back to your uncle very 
soon.” He picked up a flat board 
covered with odd markings and 
studied it with his glow lamp. 
“How do you like that?” one 



of the men working with the un- 
familiar materials muttered to 
his neighbor. “You ask him his 
people, and he says, ‘Mankind.’ 
Mankind!” 

The other man chuckled. “A 
front-burrow tribe. What the hell 
do you expect — sophistication? 
Each and every front-burrow 
tribe calls itself Mankind. As far 
as these primitives are concerned, 
the human race stops at their 
outermost burrow. Your tribe, my 
tribe — you know what they call 
us? Strangers. In their eyes, 
there’s not too much difference 
between us and the Monsters.” 

“That’s what I mean. They 
don’t see us as fellow-men. They 
are narrow-minded savages. Who 
needs them?” 

Arthur the Organizer glanced 
at Eric’s face. He turned sharply 
to the man who had spoken last. 

“I’ll tell you who needs them, 
Walter,” he said. “The Cause 
needs them. If the front-burrow 
tribes are with us, it means our 
main lines of supply to Monster 
territory are kept op>en. But we 
need every fighter we can get, 
no matter how primitive. Every 
single tribe has to be with us if 
Alien-science is to be the domi- 
nant religion of the burrows, if 
we’re to avoid the fiasco of the 
last rising. We need front-bur- 
row men for their hunting, forag- 
ing skills and back-burrow men 
for their civilized skills. We need

everybody in this thing, especially 
now.” 

The man called Walter put 
down his work and scowled at 
Eric dubiously. He seemed to be 
totally unconvinced. 

These arrogant back-burrow- 
ers with their ornamented straps 
and unmilitary manners! Men 
from different tribes sitting 
around and talking, when — if 
they had any sense of propriety 
at all — they should be killing 
each other! • 

Suddenly, the floor shook un- 
der him. He almost fell. He 
staggered back and forth, trying 
to grab at the spears in his back- 
sling. He finally got used to it, 
managed to find a solid footing 
in the upheaval. The spear he 
held vibrated in his hand. 

¥?ROM far away came a series 
of ear-splitting thumps. The 
floor swung to their rhythm. 
“What is it?” he cried, turning 
to Arthur. “What’s going on?” 

“You’ve never heard a Mon- 
ster walking before?” the Organ- 
izer asked him unbelievingly. 
“That’s right — this is your 
Theft, your first time out. It’s a 
Monster, boy. A Monster’s mov- 
ing around in the Monster larder, 
doing whatever Monsters do. 
They have a right, you know,” 
he added with a smile. “It’s their 
larder. We’re just — visitors.” 

Eric noticed that none of the 



others seemed particularly con- 
cerned. He drew a deep breath 
and reslung his spear. How the 
floor and the walls shook! What 
a fantastic, enormous creature 
that must be! 

As an apprentice warrior, he 
had often stood with the rear- 
guard on the other side of the 
doorway to Monster territory 
while the band went in to steal 
for Mankind. A few times there 
had been heavy, thumping noises 
off in the distance, and the walls 
of the burrow had quivered 
slightly. But not like this. It had 
never been remotely as awesome 
as this. 

He raised his eyes to the 
straight, flat ceiling of the bur- 
row above them. He remembered 
the dark space further back 
stretching up limitlessly. “And 
this,” he said aloud. “This 
structure we’re in. What is this to 
them?” 

Arthur the Organizer shrugged. 
“A piece of Monster furniture. 
Something they use for some- 
thing or other. We’re in one of 
the open spaces they always leave 
in the bases of their furniture. 
Makes the furniture lighter, 
easier to move around, I guess.” 
He listened for a moment as the 
thumps drifted further away and 
then died out. “Let’s get down to 
business. Eric, this is Walter the 
Weapon-Seeker. Walter the 
Weapon-Seeker of the Miximilian

people. Walter, what do you have 
for Eric’s tribe — for, uh, for 
Mankind?” 

“I hate to give anything even 
halfway good to a front-burrow 
tribe,” the squatting man mut- 
tered. “No matter how much you 
explain it to them, they always 
use it wrong, they botch it up 
every single time. Let’s see. This 
should be simple enough.” 

He rummaged in the pile of 
strange stuff in front of him and 
picked up a small, red, jelly-like 
blob. “All you do,” he explained, 
“is tear off a pinch with your 
fingers. Just a pinch at a time, no 
more. Then spit on it and throw 
it. After you spit on it, get it out 
of your hands fast. Throw it as 
fast and as far as you can. Do 
you think you can remember 
that?” 

“Yes.” Eric took the red blob 
from him and stared at it in puz- 
zlement. There was a strange, ir- 
ritating odor: it made his nose 
itch slightly. “But what happens? 
What does it do?” 

“That’s not your worry, boy,” 
Arthur the Organizer told him. 
“Your uncle will know when to 
use it. You have your third cate- 
gory theft — a Monster souvenir 
that no one in your tribe has ever 
seen before. It should make them 
sit up and take notice. And tell 
your uncle to bring his band to 
my burrow three days — three 
sleep-periods — from now. That 



will be the last time we meet 
before the rising. Tell him to 
bring them armed with every last 
spear they can carry.” 

'C’RIC nodded weakly. There 
were so many complex, in- 
comprehensible things going on! 
The world was a bigger, more 
active place than he had ever 
imagined. 

He watched Arthur the Or- 
ganizer add a mark to the flat 
board on which many symbols 
were scratched. This was another 
Stranger practice — made nec- 
essary, he knew, by the weak 
Stranger memory, so inferior to 
that of Mankind. 

The Weapon-Seeker leaped up 
and stopped him as he was about 
to put the red blob into knapsack. 
“Nothing wet in there?” Walter 
demanded, opening the bag and 
rummaging about in Eric’s be- 
longings. “No water? Remember, 
get this stuff wet and you’re done 
for.” 

“Mankind keeps its water in 
canteens,” Eric explained irrita- 
bly. “We keep it here,” he pointed 
to the sloshing pouch at his hip, 
“not splashing around loosely 
with our provisions.” He swung 
the full knapsack on his back 
and stepped away with stiff dig- 
nity. 

Arthur the Organizer accom- 
panied him to the end of the 
burrow. “Don’t mind Walter,” he 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



49 



whispered. “He’s always afraid 
that nobody but himself will be 
able to use the Monster weapKsns 
he digs up. He talks that way to 
everyone. Now, suppose I re- 
fresh your memory about the 
way back. We don’t want you to 
get lost.” 

“I won’t get lost,” Eric said 
coldly. “I have a good memory, 
and I know enough to perform a 
simple reversal of the directions 
on the way here. Besides, I am 
Eric the Espier, Eric the Eye of 
Mankind. I won’t get lost.” 

He was rather proud of him- 
self as he trotted away, without 
turning his head. Let the Stran- 
gers know what you think of 
them. The snobs. The stuck-up 
bastards. 

But still, he felt damaged 
somehow, made less — as when 
Roy the Runner had called him 
a singleton before the entire 
band. And the last comment he 
had heard behind him — “These 
primitives: so damned touchy!” 
— made it no better. 

He crossed the dark open 
space, still brooding, his eyes 
fixed on the patch of white light 
ahead, his mind engaged in a 
completely unaccustomed exam- 
ination of values. Mankind’s free 
simplicity against the Stranger 
multiplicity and intricacy. Man- 
kind’s knowledge of basics, the 
important foraging basics of day- 
to-day life, against the Stranger 



knowledge of so many things and 
techniques he had never even 
heard about. Surely Mankind’s 
way was infinitely preferable, far 
superior? 

Then why did his uncle want 
to get mixed up with Stranger 
politics, he wondered, as he 
emerged from the structure? He 
turned left and, passing the small 
entrance he had ignored before, 
sped for the wall which separated 
him from the burrows. And why 
did all these Strangers, evidently 
each from a different tribe, agree 
in the contempt with which they 
held Mankind? 

He had just turned right along 
the wall, on the last stretch be- 
fore the doorway, when the floor 
shook again, jarring him out of 
his thoughts. He bounced up and 
down, frozen with fear where he 
stood. 

He was out in the open while 
a Monster was abroad. A Mon- 
ster had come into the larder 
again. 

VI 

^AR OFF in the dazzling dis- 
^ tance, he caught sight of the 
tremendously long gray body he 
had heard about since childhood, 
hgher than a hundred men stand- 
ing on each other’s shoulders, the 
thick gray legs each wider than 
two hefty men standing chest to 
chest. He caught just one wide-

I 

eyed, fear-soluble glimpse of the 
thing before he went into com- 
plete panic. 

His panic was redeemed by a 
single inhibition: he didn’t spring 
forward and run away from the 
^all- But that was only because 
it would have meant running di- 
rectly toward the Monster. For 
one thoroughly insane moment, 
however, he thought of trying to 
claw his way through the wall 
against which his shoulders were 
pressed. 

Then — because it was the 
direction he had been running in 

he remembered the doorway. 

He must be about thirty, thirty- 
five paces from it. There lay 
safety: his uncle, the band. Man- 
kind and the burrows — the 
blessed, closed-in, narrow bur- 
rows! 

Eric leaped along the wall for 
the doorway. He ran as he’d 
never in his life run before, as 
he’d never imagined he could 
run. 

But even as he fled madly, al- 
most weeping at the effort he was 
making, a few sane thoughts — 
the result of long, tiresome drills 
as an initiate — organized them- 
selves in his screaming mind. He 
had been closer to the structure 
in which the Strangers were hid- 
ing, the structure which Arthur 
the Organizer explained was a 
piece of Monster furniture. He 
should have turned the other way. 



towards the structure, gotten be- 
tween it and the wall. There, un- 
less he’d been seen as the Mon- 
ster entered the larder, he could 
have rested safely until it was 
possible to make his escape. 

He had gone too far to turn 
back now. But run silently, he 
reminded himself: run swiftly 

but make no noise, make no noise 
at all. According to the lessons 
that the warriors taught, at this 
distance Monster hearing was 
more to be feared than Monster 
vision. Run silently. Run for your 
life. 

He reached the door. It had 
been set back in place! 

In disbelief and utter horror 
he stared at the curved line in 
the wall that showed where the 
door had been replaced in its 
socket. But this was never done! 
This had never been heard of! 

Eric beat frantically on the 
door with his fists. Would his 
knuckles make enough noise to 
penetrate the heavy slab? Or just 
enough to attract the Monster’s 
attention? 

He twisted his head quickly 
— a look, a deliberately wasted 
moment, to estimate the close- 
ness of his danger. The Monster’s 
legs moved so slowly: its speed 
would have been laughable if the 
very size of those legs didn’t 
serve to push it forward an in- 
credible distance with each step. 

And there was nothing laughable 
\ 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS

in that long, narrow neck, almost 
as long as the rest of the body, 
and the malevolent, relatively 
tiny head on the end of the neck. 
And those horrible pink things, 
all around the neck, just behind 
the head — 

It was much nearer than it 
had been just seconds ago, but 
whether it had noticed him and 
was coming at him he had no 
idea. Beat at the door with the 
shaft of a spear? That should at- 
tract attention, that might be 
heard. 

Yes, by the Monster too. 

I 'HERE was only one thing to 
do. He stepped a few paces 
back from the wall. Then he 
leaped forward, smashing his 
shoulder into the door. He felt it 
give a little. Another try. 

The floor-shaking thumps of 
the Monster’s steps were now so 
close as to be almost deafening. 
At any moment, a great gray foot 
might come down and grind out 
his life. Eric stepped back again, 
forcing himself not to look up. 

Another leap, another bruis- 
ing collision with the door. It had 
definitely moved. An indentation 
showed all around it. 

Was he about to be stepped 
on — to be squashed? 

Eric put his hands on the door. 
He pushed. Slowly, suckingly, it 
left the place out of which it had 
been carved long ago. 



Where was the Monster? How 
close? How Close? 

Suddenly, the door fell over in- 
to the burrow, and Eric spilled 
painfully on top of it. He scram, 
bled to his feet and darted down 
the corridor. 

He had no time to feel relief. 
His mind was repeating its les- 
sons, reminding him what he had 
to do next in such a situation. 

Run a short distance down the 
burrow. Then stop and wait on 
the balls of your feet, ready to 
bolt. Get as much air into your 
lungs as possible. You may need 
it. If you hear a hissing, whistling 
sound, stop breathing and start 
running. Hold your breath for as 
long as you can — as long as you 
possibly can — then suck an- 
other chestful of air and keep 
running. Keep this up until you 
are far away. Far, far away. 

Eric waited, poised to run, his 
back to the doorway. 

Don’t look around — just face 
the direction yot?ll have to run. 
There’s only one thing you have 
to worry about, only one thing 
you have to listen for. A hissing, 
whistling sound. When you hear 
it, hold your breath and run. 

He waited, his muscles con- 
tracted for instant action. 

Time went by. He remembered 
to count. If you counted up to 
five hundred, slowly, and nothing 
happened, you were likely to be 
all right. You could assume the 



j^onster probably hadn’t noticed 
you. 

So the experienced warriors 
said, the men who had lived 
through such an experience. 

Five hundred. He reached five 
hundred and, just to be on the 
safe side, still tense, still ready to 
run, counted another five hun- 
dred, up to the ultimate number 
conceived by man, a full thou- 
sand. 

No hissing, no whistling sounds. 
No suggestion of danger. 

He relaxed, and his muscles — 
suddenly set free — gave way. 
He fell to the floor of the burrow, 
whimpering with the release of 
tension. 

It was over. His Theft was 
over. He was a man. 

T¥E had been in the same place 
as a Monster, and lived 
through it. He had met Strangers 
and dealt with them as a repre- 
sentative of Mankind. Such 
things as he would have to tell 
his uncle! 

His uncle. Where was his 
uncle? Where was the band? 

Suddenly fully aware of how 
much was wrong, Eric scrambled 
to his feet and walked cautiously 
back to the open doorway. The 
burrow was empty. They hadn’t 
waited for him. 

But that was another incredi- 
ble thing! A band never gave an 
initiate up for lost until at least 



two full days had gone by. In the 
chief’s absence, of course, this was 
measured by the sleep periods of 
the band captain. Any band 
would wait two days before giv- 
ing up and turning homeward. 
And, Eric was positive, his uncle 
would have waited a bit longer 
than that for him. He’d been away 
for such a short time! Then what 
had happened? 

He crept to the doorway and 
peeped outside. There was almost 
no dizziness this time. His eyes 
adjusted quickly to the different 
scale of distance. The Monster 
was busy on the other side of the 
larder. It had merely been cross- 
ing the room, then, not pursuing 
and attacking. Apparently it 
hadn’t noticed him at all. 

Fantastic. And with all the 
noise he had made! All that rush- 
ing back and forth, that battering- 
down of the door! 

The Monster turned abruptly, 
walked a few gigantic steps and 
hurled itself at the structure in 
which Eric had met the Strangers. 
The walls, the floor, ever5dhing, 
shook mightily in sympathy to 
the impact of the great organism 
as it wriggled a bit and became 
still. 

Eric was startled until he 
realized that the creature had 
done no more than lie down in 
the structure. It was a piece of 
Monster furniture, after all. 

How had that felt to Arthur 



52 



GALAXY 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



53 



the Organizer and Walter the 
Weapon-Seeker and the others 
hidden in the base? Eric grinned. 
Those Strangers must be a little 
less haughty, a little more sober 
at this moment. 

Meanwhile, he had work to do, 
things to find out. 

He got his fingers under the 
slab of door and tugged it upright. 
It was heavy! He pushed against 
it, slowly, carefully, first one side 
and then the other, walking it 
back to the hole in the wall. A 
final push, and it slid into place 
tightly, only the thin, curved line 
suggesting its existence. 

Now he could look aroimd. 

There had been a fight here — 
that much was certain. A brief, 
bitter battle. Examining the area 
closely, Eric saw unmistakable 
signs of conflict. 

A broken spear shaft. Some 
blood on the wall. Part of a tom 
knapsack. No bodies, of course. 
You were not likely to find bodies 
after a battle. Any people of the 
burrows knew that the one un- 
avoidable imperative of victory 
was to drag the bodies away and 
dispose of them. No one might 
ever leave dead enemies to rot 
where they would foul the corri- 
dors. 

CO there had been a battle. He 
^ had been right — his uncle 
and his uncle’s band had not just 
gone off and left him. There must 

54 



have been an attack by a superior 
force. The band had stood its 
ground for a while, sustained 
some losses, and then been forced 
to retreat. 

But there were a few things 
which didn’t make sense. First, it 
was very unusual for a war party 
of Strangers to come this close to 
Monster territory. The burrows 
which were inhabited by Man- 
kind, the natural goal of a war 
party, were much further back. 
At this point, you would not ex- 
pect to find any group larger than 
a foraging expedition — a Stran- 
ger band at most. 

His uncle’s men, fully armed, 
operating under battle alert, 
could easily cope with a single 
band of weavers, weaponsmiths 
or traders from the decadent 
back burrows. They would have 
driven them off, possibly taking 
a few prisoners, and continued to 
wait for him. 

That left only two possibilities. 
The unlikely war party — a two 
or three-band attack — and, even 
more unlikely, a band from an- 
other fierce, front-burrow people. 
But front-burrowers rarely went 
prowling at random near Monster 
territory. They would have their 
own door cut into it and would 
tend to feel hugely uncertain 
about one belonging to another 
people. They too would' head for 
the inhabited burrows if they 
were on any business other than 

GALAXY 



the important one of stealing for 
their tribe’s needs. 

And another thing. Unless his 
uncle’s band had been wiped out 
to the very last man — a thought 
Eric rejected as highly improb- 
ghle — the survivors were honor- 
bound, by their oath of manhood, 
after doing whatever the immedi- 
ate military situation required, 
from pursuit to retreat, to return 
as soon as possible to the spot 
where an initiate was expected 
back from his Theft. No warrior 
would dare face the women if he 
failed to do this. 

Possibly the attack had just 
come. Possibly his uncle’s band 
was a short distance away, still 
fighting their way from burrow’s 
end to burrow’s end; and, once 
they had gotten clear of the 
enemy, would make their way 
back to him. 

No. In that case, he should be 
able to hear the battle still going 
on. And the burrows were dread- 
fully still. 

Eric shivered. A warrior was 
not meant to be abroad without 
companions. He’d heard of tribe- 
less Strangers — once, as a child, 
he remembered enjoying the in- 
tricate execution of a man who’d 
been expelled from his own peo- 
ple for some major crime and who 
had wandered pathetically into 
the neighborhood of Mankind — 
but these people were hardly to 
be considered human: tribes, 

THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



bands, societies, were the sur- 
roundings of human creatures. 

It was awful to be alone. It 
was unthinkable. 

W ITHOUT bothering to eat, 
though he was quite hungry 
after his Theft, he began walking 
rapidly down the corridor. After 
a while, he broke into a trot. He 
wanted to get home as soon as 
possible — to be among his own 
kind again. 

He reached into his back-sling 
and got a sp>ear for each hand. 

A nervous business going 
through the corridors all by your- 
self. They were so empty and so 
quiet. They hadn’t seemed this 
quiet when he’d been on expedi- 
tion with the band. And so fear- 
fully, frighteningly dim. Eric had 
never before realized how much 
difference there was between the 
light you got from one forehead 
glow-lamp and the usual band 
complement of a half-dozen. He 
found himself getting more and 
more wary of the unexpected 
shadows where the wall curved 
sharply: he picked up speed as 
he ran past the black hole of a 
branching burrow. 

At any one of those places, an 
enemy could be waiting for him, 
warned by the sound of his ap- 
proaching footsteps. It could be 
the same enemy which had at- 
atacked his uncle’s band, a hand- 
ful of cruel and murderous 

55 






Strangers, or a horde of them. It 
could ' be something worse. Ab- 
ruptly he remembered legends of 
unmentiohable creatures who 
lurked in the empty burrows, 
creatures who fled before the ap- 
proach of a band of warriors, but 
who would come noiselessly upon 
a single man. Big creatures who 
engulfed you. Tiny creatures 
who came in their hundreds and 
nibbled you to pieces. Eric kept 
jerking his head around to look 
behind him : at least he could 
keep his doom from taking him 
by surprise. 

It was awful to be alone. 

And yet, in the midst of his 
fears, his mind returned again and 
again to the problem of his uncle’s 
disappearance. Eric could not 
believe anything serious had hap- 
pened to him. Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher was a veteran of too 
many bloody adventures, too 
many battles against unequal 
odds. Then where had he gone? 
And where had he taken the 
band? 

And why was there no sound 
of him anywhere, no sign in all 
this infinity of gloomy, stretch- 
ing, menace-filled tunnels? 

Fortunately, he was an Eye. He 
knew the way back and sped 
desperately along it without the 
slightest feeling of doubt. The 
Record Machine was right: he 
would never be lost. Let him just 
get safely back to the companion- 



ship of Mankind and he would be 
Eric the Eye. 

And there it was again: who 
had been right, the Record Ma- 
chine or his uncle? The vision 
that named him had come from 
the Record Machine, but his 
uncle claimed that this was reli. 
gious claptrap. The vision had 
been selected and his name pro- 
posed to the women well in ad- 
vance of the ceremony. And his 
uncle was an Alien-sciencer, in 
touch with Strangers who were 
also Alien-sciencers. 

So many things had happened 
in the last two days, Eric felt 
So much of his world had shifted. 
It was as if the walls of the bur- 
rows had moved outward and up- 
ward until they resembled Mon- 
ster territory more than human 
areas. 

"IJE WAS getting close now. 

These corridors looked 
friendlier, more familiar. He 
made himself run faster, although 
he was almost at the point of ex- 
haustion. He wanted to be home, 
to be officially Eric the Eye, to 
inform Mankind of what had 
happened so that a rescue and 
searching party could be sent out 
for his uncle. 

That doorway to Monster ter- 
ritory: who had replaced it? If 
a battle had been fought, and his 
uncle’s band had retreated, still 
fighting, would the attacker have 



stopped to put the door neatly 
back in its socket? No. 

Could it be explained by a 
sudden onslaught and the com- 
plete extermination of his uncle’s 
band? Then, before dragging the 
bodies away, the enemy would 
bave had time to put the door 
back. A doorway into Monster 
territory was a valuable human 
resource, after all, valuable to 
Mankind and Strangers alike — 
why jeopardize it by leaving it 
visible and op>en? 

But who — or what — could 
have been capable of such a sud- 
den onslaught, such a complete 
extermination of the best-led 
band in all Mankind? He’d have 
to get the answer from one of the 
other band captains or possibly a 
wise old crone in the Female 
Society. 

Definitely within the bounda- 
ries of Mankind now, Eric forced 
himself to slow to a Walk. He 
would be coming upon a sentry 
at any moment, and he had no 
desire at all to have a spear flung 
through him. A sentry would re- 
act violently to a man dashing out 
of the darkness. 

“Eric the Only,” he called out, 
identifying himself with each 
step. “This is Eric the Only.” 
Then he remembered his Theft 
proudly and changed the identi- 
fication. “Eric the Eye. This is 
Eric the Eye, the Espier, the 
further-seeing, less-paying Eye.' 



Eric the Eye is coming back to 
Mankind!” 

Oddly, there was no returning 
call of recognition. Eric didn’t 
understand that. Had Mankind 
itself been attacked and driven 
away from its burrow? A sentry 
should respond to a familiar 
name. Something was very, in- 
explicably wrong. 

Then he came around the last 
curve and saw the sentry at the 
other end. Rather, he saw what 
at first looked like three sentries. 
They were staring at him, and 
he recognized them. Stephen the 
Strong-Armed and two members 
of Stephen’s band. Evidently he 
had arrived just at the moment 
when the sentry on duty was 
about to be relieved. That would 
account for Stephen and the 
other man. But why hadn’t they 
replied to his shouts of identifi- 
cation? 

They stood there silently as he 
came up, their spears still at the 
ready, not going down in wel- 
come. “Eric the Eye,” he repeated, 
puzzled. “I’ve made my Theft, 
but something happened to the 
rest — ” 

His voice trailed off, as Stephen 
came up to him, his face grim, 
his powerful muscles taut. The 
band captain shoved a spear 
point hard against Eric’s chest. 
“Don’t move,” he warned. “Bar- 
ney. John. Tie him up. We’ve 
caught the little rat!”

T¥IS spears taken from him, his 
arms bound securely behind 
his back by the thongs of his own 
knapsack, Eric was pushed and 
prodded into the great central 
burrow of Mankind. 

The place was almost unrecog- 
nizable. 

Under the direction of Ottilie, 
the Chieftain’s First Wife, a 
horde of women — what seemed 
at first like the entire member- 
ship of the Female Society — 
was setting up a platform in front 
of the Royal Mound. With the 
great scarcity of any building 
materials that Mankind suffered 
from, a construction of this sort 
was startling and unusual, yet 
there was something about it that 
awoke highly unpleasant memo- 
ries in Eric’s mind. But he was 
pulled from place to place too 
fast and there were too many 
other unprecedented things go- 
ing on for him to be able to 
identify the memory properly. 

Two women who were accred- 
ited members of the Female So- 
ciety were not working under 
Ottilie’s direction, he noticed. 
Bound hand and foot, they were 
lying against the far wall of the 
great central burrow. They were 
both covered with blood and 
showed every sign of having un- 
dergone prolonged and most 
vicious torture. He judged them 



to be barely this side of death. 

As he was jerked past, he ree 
ognized them. They were the two’ 
wives of Thomas the Trap-Smash.| 
er. ' 

Just wait until his uncle ^o! 
back! Someone would really pay 
for this, he thought, more in ah 
solute amazement than horror. He 
had the feeling that he must keep 
the horror away at all costs. Once 
let it in and it would soak through 
his thoughts right into the mem- 
ory he was trying to avoid. 

The place was full of armed 
men, running back and forth from 
their band captains to unknown 
destinations in the outlying cor- 
ridors. Between them and around 
them scuttled the children, fetch 
ing and carrying raw materials 
for the hard-working women, 
There was a steady buzz of com-j 
mands in the air . “Go to — *. 
“Bring some more — ” “Hurryl 
with the — ” . that mingled' 
with the smell of many people 
whose pores were sweating ur-i 
gency. And it wasn’t just sweat 
that he smelled. Eric realized as| 
he was dragged before the Royall 
Mound. It was anger. The anger 
and fear of all Mankind. 

Franklin the Father of Many 
Thieves stood on the mound, 
carrying unaccustomed spears in 
his fat hands, talking rapidly to 
a group of warriors, band captains 
and — yes, actually! — Strangers. 
Even now, Eric found he could 



58 



GALAXY 





still be astonished at this fantastic 
development. 

Strangers in the very midst of 
Mankind! Walking around freely 
and bearing arms! 

As the chief caught sight of 
Eric, his face broke into a loose- 
skinned smile. He nudged a 
Stranger beside him and pointed 
at the prisoner. 

“That’s him,” he said. “That’s 
the nephew. The one that asked 
for the third category Theft. Now 
we’ve got them all.” 

The Stranger didn’t smile. He 
looked briefly at Eric and turned 
away. “I’m glad you think so. 
From our point of view, you’ve 
just got one more.” 

I^RANKLIN’S smile faded to 
an uncertain grin. “Well, you 
know what I mean. And the 
damned fool came back by him- 
self. It saved us a lot of trouble, 
I mean, didn’t it?” Receiving no 
answer, he shrugged. He gestured 
with flabby imperiousness at 
Eric’s guards. “You know where 
to put him. We’ll be ready for 
them pretty soon.” 

Again the p>oint of a spear 
stabbed into Eric’s back, and he 
was forced forward across the 
central space to a small burrow 
entrance. Before he could reach 
it, however, he heard Franklin 
the Father of Many Thieves call 
out to Mankind: “There goes 
Eric, my people. Eric the Only. 



Now we’ve got the last of the 
filthy gang!” 

For a moment, the activity 
stopf)ed and seemed to focus on 
him. Eric shivered as a low, 
drawn-out grunt of viciousness 
and hatred arose everywhere, but 
most of all from the women. 

Someone ran up to him. Harriet 
the History-Teller. The girl’s face 
was absolutely contorted. She 
reached up to the crown of her 
head and pulled out the long pin 
held in place by a few knotted 
scarlet hairs. About her face and 
neck the hair danced like flames. 

“You Alien - sciencer!” she 
shrieked, driving the pin straight 
at his eyes. “You filthy, filthy 
Alien-sciencer!” 

Eric whipped his head to one 
side; she was back at him in a 
moment. His guards leaped at 
the girl and grappled with her, 
but she was able to get in one 
ripping slash that opened up al- 
most all of his right cheek before 
they drove her away. 

“Leave something for the rest 
of us,” one of his guards pleaded 
the cause of reason as he strolled 
back to Eric. “After all, he be- 
longs to the whole of Mankind.” 

“He does not!” she yelled. “He 
belongs to me most of all. I was 
going to mate with him when he 
returned from his Theft, wasn’t I, 
Mother?” 

“There wasn’t Anything offi- 
cial,” Eric heard Rita the Record- 



JCeeper admonishing as he tried 
to stanch the flow of blood by 
bringing his shoulder up and 
pressing it against the wound. 
“There couldn’t be anything offi- 
cial about it until he’d achieved 
manhood. So you’ll just have to 
wait your turn, Harriet, darling. 
You’ll have to wait until your 
elders are finished with him. 
There’ll be plenty left for you.” 

“There won’t be,” the girl 
pouted. “I know what you’re like. 
There won’t be hardly anything 
left.” 

Eric was shoved at the small 
burrow entrance again. The mo- 
ment he was inside it, one of his 
guards planted a foot in his back, 
knocking the breath out of him. 
The kick propelled him forward, 
staggering wildly for balance, un- 
til he smashed into the opposite 
wall. As he fell, unable to use his 
arms to cushion himself, he heard 
laughter behind him in the great 
central burrow. He rolled on his 
side dizzily. There was a fresh 
flow of blood coming down from 
his cheek. 

This wasn’t the homecoming 
he’d imagined after his Theft — 
not in the slightest! What was go- 
ing on? 

He knew where he was. A tiny, 
blind-alley burrow off Mankind’s 
major meeting-place, a sort of lit- 
tle vault used mostly for storage. 
Excess food and goods stolen 
from Monster territory were kept 



here until there was enough ac- 
cumulated for a trading expedi- 
tion to the back burrows. Occa- 
sionally, also, a male Stranger, 
taken prisoner in battle, might be 
held in this place until Mankind 
found out if his tribe valued him 
enough to pay anything substan- 
tial for his recovery. 

And if they didn’t . 

^RIC remembered the unusual 
structure that the women 
had been building near the Royal 
Mound — and shivered. The 
memory that he’d suppressed had 
now come alive in his mind. And 
it fitted with the way Harriet had 
acted — and with what her 
mother, Rita the Record-Keeper, 
had said. 

They couldn’t be planning that 
for himf He was a member of 
Mankind, almost a full warrior. 
They didn’t even do that to 
Strangers captured in battle — 
not normal Strangers. A warrior 
was always respected as a warrior. 
At the worst, he deserved a de- 
cent execution, quietly done. Ex- 
cept for — Except for — 

“TVo!” he screamed. “No\” 

The single guard who’d been 
left on duty at the entrance 
turned around and regarded him 
humorously. 

“Oh, yes,” he said. “Oh, defi- 
nitely yes! We’re going to have a 
lot of fun with both of you, as 
soon as the women say they’re 



60 



GALAXY 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS

ready.” He nodded with ominous, 
emphatic slowness and turned 
back to miss none of the prepara- 
tions. 

Both of you? For the first time, 
Eric looked around the little stor- 
age burrow. The place was almost 
empty of goods, but off to one 
side, in the light of his forehead 
glow-lamp (how proud he had 
been when it had been bestowed 
on him at the doorway to Mon- 
ster territory!) he now saw an- 
other man lying bound against 
the wall. 

His uncle. 

Eric brought his knees up and 
wriggled rapidly over to him. It 
was a painful business. His belly 
and sides were not calloused and 
inured to the rough burrow floor 
like his feet. But what did a few 
scratches more or less matter any 
more? 

The Trap-Smasher was barely 
conscious. He had been severely 
handled, and he looked almost as 
bad as his wives. There was a 
thick crust of dried blood on his 
hair. The haft of a spear, Eric 
guessed, had all but cracked his 
head open. And in several places 
on his body, his right shoulder, 
just above his left hip, deep in his 
thigh, were the oozing craters of 
serious spear wounds, raw and 
unbandaged. 

“Uncle Thomas,” Eric urged. 
“What happened? Who did this 
to you?” 



'^■''HE wounded man opened his 
eyes and shuddered. He 
looked around stupidly as if he 
had expected to find the walls 
talking to him. And his powerful 
arms struggled with the knots that 
held them firmly behind his back. 
When he finally located Eric, he 
smiled. 

It was a bad thing to do. Some- 
one had also smashed in most of 
his front teeth. 

“Hello, Eric,” he mumbled. 
“What a fight, eh? How did the 
rest of the band do? Anybody get 
away?” 

“I don’t know. That’s what I’m 
asking you! I came back from my 
Theft — you were gone — the 
band was gone. I got here, and 
everyone’s crazy! There are Stran- 
gers out there, walking around 
with weapons in our burrows. 
Who are they?” 

Thomas the Trap-Smasher’s 
eyes had slowly darkened. They 
were fully in focus now, and long 
threads of agony swam in them. 
“Strangers?” he asked in a low 
voice. “Yes, there were Strangers 
fighting in Stephen the Strong- 
Armed’s band. Fighting against 
us. That chief of ours — Franklin 
— he got in touch with Strangers 
after we left. They compared 
notes. They must have been work- 
ing together, been in touch with 
each other, for a long time. Man- 
kind, Strangers, what difference 
does it make when their lousy 



62 



GALAXY 



Ancestor-science is threatened? I 
should have remembered.” 

‘What?” Eric begged. “What 
should you have remembered?” 
“That’s the way they put down 
Alien-science in the other rising, 
long ago. A chiefs a chief. He’s 
got more in common with another 
chief — even a chief of Strangers 

than with his own people. You 

attack Ancestor - science, and 
you’re attacking their power as 
chiefs. They’ll work together then. 
They’ll give each other men, 
weapons, information. They’ll do 
eversdhing they can against the 
common enemy. Against the only 
people who really want to hit 
back at the Monsters. I should 
have remembered! Damn it all,” 
the Trap - Smasher groaned 
through his ruined mouth, “I saw 
that the chief and Ottilie were 
suspicious. I should have realized 
how they were going to handle it. 
They were going to call in Stran- 
gers, exchange information — and 
unite against us!” 

Eric stared at his uncle, dimly 
understanding. Just as there was 
a secret organization of Alien- 
sciencers that cut across tribal 
boimdaries, so there was a tacit, 
rarely-used understanding among 
the chiefs, based on the Ancestor- 
science religion that was the main 
prop of their power. And the pow- 
er of the leaders of the Female 
Society, come to think of it. All 
special privileges were derived 



from their knowledge of ancestor- 
science. Take that away from 
them, and they’d be ordinary 
women with no more magical 
abilities than was necessary to 
tell edible food from Monster 
poison. 

Grunting with pain, Thomas 
the Trap-Smasher wormed his 
way up to a sitting position 
against the wall. He kept shaking 
his head as if to jar recollection 
loose. 

“They came up to us,” he said 
heavily, “Stephen the Strong- 
Armed and his band came up to 
us just after you’d gone into Mon- 
ster territory. A band from Man- 
kind with a message from the 
chief — who suspected anything? 
They might be coming to tell us 
that the home burrows were un- 
der attack by Strangers. Stran- 
gers!” He gave a barking laugh, 
and some blood splashed out of 
his mouth. “They had Strangers 
with them, hidden all the way 
behind in the corridors. Mobs 
and mobs of Strangers.” 

I^RIC began to visualize what 
had happened. 

“Then, when they were among 
us, when most of us had reslung 
our spears, they hit us. Eric, they 
hit us real godd. They had us 
so much by surprise that they 
didn’t even need outside help. I 
don’t think there was much left 
of us by the time the Strangers 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



63 



came running up. I was do^n, 
fighting with my bare hands, and 
so was the rest of the band. The 
Strangers did the mopping up. I 
didn’t see most of it. Somebody 
handed me one hell of a wallop 

— I never expected to wake up 
alive.” His voice got even lower 
and huskier. “I’d have been lucky 
not to.” 

The Trap - Smasher’s chest 
heaved: a strange, long noise 

came out of it. “They brought me 
back here. My wives — they were 
working on my wives. Those 
bitches from the Female Society 

— Ottilie, Rita — this part of it 
is their business — they had my 
wives pegged out and they 
worked on them in front of me. I 
was blanking out and coming to, 
blanking out and coming to; I was 
conscious while they — ” 

He dropped to a bloody mum- 
ble again, his head falling forward 
loosely. His voice became clear 
for a moment, but not entirely 
rational. “They were good wom- 
en,” he muttered. “Both of them. 
Good, good girls. And they loved 
me. They had their chance to be- 
come more important. A dozen 
times Franklin must have offered 
to impregnate them, and they 
turned him down every time. 
They really loved me.” 

Eric almost sobbed himself. 
He’d had little to do with them 
once he’d reached the age of the 
warrior initiate, but in his child- 



hood, they’d given him all the 
mother love he ever remembered. 
They’d cuffed him and caressed 
him and wiped his nose. They’d 
told him stories and taught him 
the catechism of the ancestral 
science. Neither had sons of his 
age who had survived the various 
plagues and the Monster-inflicted 
calamities that periodically swept 
through Mankind’s burrows. He’d 
been lucky. He’d received much 
of the care and affection that 
their own sons might have en- 
joyed. 

Their fidelity to the Trap- 
Smasher had been a constant 
source of astonishment in Man- 
kind. It had cost them more than 
the large, healthy litters for which 
the chief had a well proven ca- 
pacity: such eccentric, almost 

non-womanly behavior had in- 
evitably denied them the high 
positions in the Female Society 
they would otherwise have en- 
joyed. 

And now they were dead or dy- 
ing, and their surviving babies 
had been apportioned to other 
women whose importance would 
thereby be substantially in- 
creased. 

“Tell me,” he asked his uncle. 
“Why did the Female Society 
kill them? What did they do that 
was so awful?” 

He saw that Thomas had lifted 
his head again and was staring at 
him. With pity. He felt his own 

GALAXY 



body turn completely cold even 
before the Trap-Smasher spoke. 

“You still won’t let yourself 
think about it? I don’t blame you, 
Eric. But it’s there. It’s being pre- 
pared for us outside.” 

“What?” Eric demanded, al- 
though a distant part of him had 
already worked out the terrible 
answer and knew what it was. 

‘We’ve been declared outlaws, 
Eric. They say we’re guilty of 
the ultimate sacrilege against 
Ancestor-Science. We don’t be- 
long to Mankind anymore — ^you, 
me, my family, my band. We’re 
outside Mankind, outside the law, 
outside religion. And you know 
what happens to outlaws, Eric, 
don’t you? Anything goes. Any- 
thing.” 

VIII 

E ver since early childhood, 
Eric remembered looking for- 
ward to ceremonies of this sort. 
A Stranger would have been 
caught by one of the warrior 
bands, and it would be deter- 
mined that he was an outlaw. 
Nine times out of ten, such a man 
was easy enough to identify. No 
one but an outlaw, for example, 
would be wandering the burrows 
by himself, without a band or at 
least a single companion to guard 
his back. The tenth time, when 
there was the slightest doubt, a 
request for ransom to his people 

^ THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



would make the prisoner’s posi- 
tion clear. There would be a story 
of some unforgivable sacrilege, 
some particularly monstrous 
crime that could be punished by 
nothing but complete anathema 
and the revocation of all privi- 
leges as a human being. The man 
had escaped the punishment be- 
ing prepared for him. Do with 
him as you will, his people would 
say. He is no longer one of us; 
he is the same as a Monster; he 
is something non-human so far 
as we are concerned. 

Then a sort of holiday would 
be declared. Out of the bits and 
pieces of lumber stolen from 
Monster territory and set aside 
by the women for this purpose, 
the members of the Female So- 
ciety would erect a structure 
whose specifications had been 
handed down from mother to 
daughter for countless genera- 
tions — all the way back to the 
ancestors who had built the 
Record-Machines. It was called 
a Stage or a Theater, although 
Eric had also heard it referred to 
as The Scaffold. In any case, 
whatever its true name, most of 
the details concerning it were 
part of the secret lore of the Fe- 
male Society and, as such, were 
no proper concern of males. 

One thing about it, however, 
everyone knew. On it would be 
enacted a moving religious dra- 
ma: the ultimate triumph of hu- 



64 



65 



manity over the wickedness of 
the Monsters. 

For this, the central character 
had to fulfill two requirements. 
He had to be an intelligent crea- 
ture, as the Monsters were, so 
that he could be made to suffer 
as some day Mankind meant the 
Monsters to suffer; and he had to 
be non-human, as the Monsters 
were, so that every drop of fear, 
resentment and hatred distilled 
by the enormous swaggering 
aliens could be poured out upon 
his flesh without any inhibition of 
compunction or fellow-feeling. 

For this purpose, outlaws were 
absolutely ideal, since all agreed 
that such disgusting creatures had 
resigned their membership in the 
human race. 

VjiTTiEN an outlaw was caught, 
work stopped in the bur- 
rows, and Mankind’s warrior 
bands were called home. It was 
a great time, a joyous time, a 
time of festival. Even the chil- 
dren — doing whatever they could 
to prepare for the glorious event, 
running errands for the laboring 
women, fetching refreshment for 
the stalwart, guarding men — 
even the children boasted to each 
other of how they would express 
their hatred upon this trapped 
representative of the non-human, 
this bound and shrieking pro- 
tagonist of the utterly alien. 

Everyone had their chance. All, 



from the chief himself to the 
youngest child capable of reciting 
the catechism of ancestral sci- 
ence, all climbed in their turn 
upon the Stage — or Theater — ■ 
or Scaffold — that the women 
had erected. All were thrilled to 
vent a portion of Mankind’s 
vengeance upon the creature who 
had been declared alien, as an 
earnest of what they would some 
day do collectively to the Mon- 
sters who had stolen their world. 

Sarah the Sickness-Healer had 
her turn early in the proceedings; 
thenceforth, she stood on the 
structure and carefully supervised 
the ceremony. It was her job to 
see that nobody went too far, 
that everyone had a fair and ade- 
quate turn, and that even at the 
end there was some life left in 
the victim. Because then, at the 
end, the structure had to be com- 
pletely burned — along with its 
bloody occupant — as a symbol 
of how the Monsters must even- 
tually be turned into ash and be 
blown away and vanish. 

“And Mankind will come into 
its own,” she would chant, while 
the charred fragments were 
kicked out of the burrow con- 
temptuously. “And the Monsters 
will be gone. They will be gone 
forever, and there will be nothing 
upon all the wide Earth but Man- 
kind.” 

Afterwards, there was feasting, 
there was dancing, there was sing- 



66 



GALAXY 



ing- Men and women chased each 
other into the dimmer side corri- 
dors; children whooped and yelled 
around the great central burrow; 
the few old folks went to sleep 
^th broad, reminiscent smiles 
upon their faces. Everyone felt 
they had somehow struck back 
at the Monsters. Everyone felt a 
little like the lords of creation 
their ancestors had been. 

Eric remembered the things he 
himself had done — the things 
he had seen others do — on these 
occasions. A tremendous tic of 
fear rippled through his body. He 
had to draw his shoulders up to 
his neck in a tight hunch and 
tense the muscles of his arms and 
legs. Finally his nerves subsided. 

He could think again. Only he 
didn’t want to think. 

Those others, those outlaws in 
previous ceremonies of this sort 
in auld lang synes long past — 
was it possible that they had ex- 
perienced the same sick, be- 
wildered dread while waiting for 
the structure to be completed? 
Had they trembled like this, had 
they also felt wetness running 
down their backs, had they felt 
the same pleading squirm in their 
intestines, the same anticipatory 
twinges of soft, vulnerable flesh? 

T^HE thought had never crossed 
his mind before. He’d seen 
them as things completely out- 
side humanity, the compressed 



symbol of all that was alien. One 
worried about their feelings no 
more than about those of the 
roaches scurrying madly about 
here in the storage burrow. One 
squashed them slowly or rapidly 
— at one’s pleasure. What differ- 
ence did it make? You didn’t 
sympathize with roaches. You 
didn’t identify with them. 

But now that he was about to 
be squashed himself, he realized 
that it did make a difference. He 
was human. No matter what 
Mankind and its leaders now de- 
clared him to be, he was human. 
He felt human fears; he experi- 
enced a desperate human desire 
to live. 

Then so had the others been. 
The outlaws whom he’d helped 
tear to pieces. Human. Com- 
pletely human. 

They’d sat here, just as he did 
now, they’d sat and waited for 
the festival and its agonies . 

Only twice in his memory had 
members of Mankind ever been 
declared outlaw. Both cases had 
occurred a long time ago, before 
he’d even been a warrior-initiate. 
Eric tried now to remember what 
they had been like as living peo- 
ple. He wanted to reach out and 
feel companionship, some sort of 
companionship, even that of the 
dead. The dead were better than 
this beaten, bloody man next to 
him who had subsided into half- 
insane mumbles, his battered 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



67 



head on his torn and wound- 
scribbled chest. 

What had they been like? It 
was no use. In the first case, mem- 
ory brought back only a picture 
of a screaming hulk just before 
the fire was lit. No recollection 
of a man. No fellow-human in 
Mankind. And in the second 
case — 

Eric sat bolt upright, straining 
against his bonds. The second 
man to be declared an outlaw had 
escaped ! How he had done it Eric 
had never found out: he remem- 
bered only that a guard was se- 
verely punished, and that bands 
of warriors had sniffed for him 
along far-distant corridors for a 
long time afterward. 

Escape. That was it. He had to 
escape. Once declared an outlaw, 
he could have no hope of mercy, 
no remission of sentence. The re- 
ligious overtones of the ceremony 
being prepared were too highly 
charged to be halted for anything 
short of the disappearance of its 
chief protagonist. 

Yes, escape. But how? Even if 
he could get free of the knots 
which so expertly and so strongly 
tied his hands behind his back, 
he had no weapon to hand. The 
guard at the entrance would 
transfix him with a spear in a 
moment. And if he failed, there 
were others outside, almost the 
entire warrior strength of the 
people. 



How? How? He forced himselj 
to be calm, to go over every pos- 
sible alternative in his mind. He 
knew there was not much time. 
In a little while,- the structure 
would be finished and the leaders 
of the Female Society would 
come for him. 

I^RIC began working on the 
knots behind him. He worked 
without much hope. If he could 
get his hands loose, perhaps he 
might squirm his way carefully to 
the entrance, leap up suddenly 
and break into a run. So what if 
they threw a spear through him 
— wouldn’t that be better and 
quicker than the other thing? 

But they wouldn’t, he realized. 
Not unless he were very lucky 
and some warrior forgot to think 
straight. In cases like this, when 
it was a matter of keeping, not 
killing a prisoner, you aimed for 
the legs. There were at least a 
dozen men in Mankind with skill 
great enough to bring him down 
even at twenty or twenty-five 
paces. And another dozen who 
might be able to catch him. He 
was no Roy the Runner, after all. 

Roy! He was dead and sew- 
ered by now. He found himself 
regretting the fight he’d had with 
Roy. 

A Stranger passed by the stor- 
age burrow entrance, glancing in 
with only a slight curiosity. He 
was followed in a moment by two 



more Strangers, going the same 
They were leaving, Eric 
guessed, before the ceremony be- 
gan. They probably had cere- 
monies of their own to attend — 
^th their own people. 

Walter the Weapon-Seeker, 
Arthur the Organizer — were they 
at this moment sitting in similar 
storage burrows awaiting the 
same slow death? Eric doubted it. 
Somehow he couldn’t see these 
men caught as easily as he and 
his uncle had been. Arthur was 
too clever, he was certain of that, 
and Walter, well, Walter would 
come up with some fantastic wea- 
pon that no one had ever seen or 
heard of . 

Like the one he had in his 
knapsack right now — that red 
blob the Weapon-Seeker had 
given him! 

Was it a weapon? He didn’t 
know. But even if it wasn’t, he 
had the impression it could create 
some kind of surprise. “It should 
make them sit up and take no- 
tice,” Walter had said back in 
Monster territory. 

Any kind of surprise, any kind 
of upset and he might have a 
diversion under cover of which he 
and his uncle could escape. 

But that was the trouble. His 
uncle. With his hands bound as 
thoroughly as he could now as- 
certain they were, he needed his 
uncle’s help to do anything at all. 
And the Trap-Smasher was ob- 



viously too far gone to be at all 
useful. 

He was talking to himself in a 
steady, monotonous, argumenta- 
tive mutter, his upper body 
slumping further and further 
across his own lap. Every once in 
a while, the mutters would be 
broken by a sharp, almost sur- 
prised moan as his wounds woke 
into a clearer consciousness of 
themselves. 

Most other men in his condi- 
tion, Eric judged, would have 
been dead by now. Only a body 
as powerful as the Trap- 
Smasher’s could have lasted this 
long. And — who knew? — if 
they could escape, it was possible 
that his uncle’s wounds, given 
care and rest, might heal. 

If they could escape. 

TNCLE THOMAS,” he said, 

^ leaning toward him and 
whispering urgently. “I think I 
know a way out. I think I’ve fig- 
ured out a way to escape.” 

No response. The bloody head 
continued to talk in a low, tone- 
less voice to the lap. Mutter, mut- 
ter, mutter. Moan. Mutter, mut- 
ter. 

“Your wives,” Eric said des- 
perately. “Your wives. Don’t you 
want to get revenge for your 
wives? 

That seemed to be worth a 
flicker. “My wives,” said the thick 
voice. “They were good women. 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



69 



Real good women. They never 
let Franklin near them. They 
were real good women.” Then the 
flicker was over and the mutters 
returned. 

“Escape!” Eric whispered. 
“Don’t you want to escape?” 

A thin, coagulating line of 
blood dripped out of his uncle’s 
slowly working jaws. There was 
no other answer. 

Eric looked towards the en- 
trance of the storage burrow. The 
guard posted there was no longer 
turning from time to time to 
glance at the prisoners. The 
structure outside was evidently 
nearing completion, and his in- 
terest in the final preparations 
had caused him to take a step or 
two away from the entrance. He 
was staring off to the left down 
the great central burrow in abso- 
lute fascination. 

Well, that was something. It 
gave them a chance. On the other 
hand, it also meant that they had 
scant moments left to their lives. 
Any time now, the leaders of the 
Female Society would be coming 
to drag them to the torture cere- 
mony. 

With his eyes oh the guard, 
Eric leaned against the rough 
burrow wall and began scraping 
the imprisoning knapsack thongs 
against the sharpest edges he 
could find. It wouldn’t be fast 
enough, he realized. If there were 
only a spear point in this place, 



something sharp. He looked 
around feverishly. No, nothing. A 
few tumbled bags of food over 
which lazy roaches wandered. 
Nothing he could use to help him 
get free. 

His uncle was his only hope. 
Somehow he had to rouse the 
man, get through to him. He 
squirmed up close, his mouth 
against the Trap-Smasher’s bat- 
tered ear. 

“This is Eric, Eric the Only. 
Do you remember me. Uncle? I 
went on the Theft, Uncle Thom- 
as, I went on the Theft with you. 
Third category. Remember, I 
asked for a third category theft, 
just like you told me to? I did 
my Theft, I was successful, I 
made it. I did just what you told 
me to do. I’m Eric the Eye now, 
right? Tell me, am I Eric the 
Eye?” 

Mutters, mumbles and moans. 
The man seemed beyond intelligi- 
bility. 

“What about Franklin? He 
can’t do this to us, can he. Uncle 
Thomas? Don’t you want to es- 
cape? Don’t you want revenge on 
Franklin, on Ottilie, for what they 
did to your wives? Don’t you? 
Don't you?” 

He had to cut through his 
uncle’s confused mist of gathering 
delirium. 

In complete desperation, he 
lowered his head and sank his 
teeth into a wounded shoulder. 



70 



GALAXY 



N othing, just the steady 
flow of argumentative gib- 
berish. And the thin blood drip- 
ping from the mouth. 

“I saw Arthur the Organizer. 
He said he’d known you for a 
long time. When did you meet 
him, Uncle Thomas? When did 
you first meet Arthur the Organ- 
izer?” 

The head drooped lower, the 
shoulders slumped further for- 
ward. 

“Tell me about Alien-science. 
What is Alien-science?” Eric was 
almost gibbering himself now in 
his frantic efforts to find a key 
that would unlock his uncle’s 
mind. “Are Arthur the Organizer 
and Walter the Weapon-Seeker 
very important men among the 
Alien-sciencers? Are they the 
chiefs? What was the name of the 
structure they were hiding in? 
What is it to the Monsters? They 
talked about other tribes, tribes I 
never heard of. How many other 
tribes are there? Are these other 
tribes — ” 

That was it. He had found the 
key. He had gotten through. 

Thomas the Trap -Smasher’s 
head came up waveringly, dim- 
ness swirling in his eyes. “Other 
tribes. Funny that you should ask 
about other tribes. That you 
should ask.” 

“Why? What about them?” 
Eric fought to hold the key in 
place, to keep it turning. “Why 



shouldn’t I ask about those other 
tribes?” 

“Your grandmother was from 
another tribe, a real strange tribe 
in a faroff burrow. I remember 
hearing about it when I was a lit- 
tle boy.” Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher nodded to himself. 
“Your grandfather’s band went 
on a long journey, the longest 
they’d ever taken. And they 
caught your grandmother and 
brought her back.” 

“My grandmother?” For the 
moment, Eric forgot what was be- 
ing prepared for him outside. 
He’d known there was some pecu- 
liar secret about his grandmother. 
She had rarely been mentioned in 
Mankind. Up to now, he’d taken 
it for granted that this was be- 
cause she’d had a son who was 
terribly unlucky — almost the 
worst thing a person in the bur- 
rows could be. A one-child litter, 
after all, and being killed together 
with his wife in Monster territory. 
Very unlucky. 

46 ]%/fY grandmother was from 
another tribe? Not from 
Mankind?” He knew, of course, 
that several of the women had 
been captmed from other peoples 
in neighboring burrows and had 
the good fortune now to be con- 
sidered full-fledged members of 
Mankind. Sometimes one of their 
own women would be lost this 
way, when she strayed too far 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



71 



down an outlying burrow and 
stumbled into a band of Stranger 
warriors. If you stole a woman 
from another people, after all, 
you stole a substantial portion of 
their knowledge. But he’d never 
imagined — 

“Dora the Dream-Singer.” 
Thomas’s head waggled loosely: 
he dribbled words mixed with red 
saliva. “Did you know why your 
grandmother was called the 
Dream-Singer, Eric? The women 
used to say that the things she 
talked about happened only in 
dreams, and that she couldn’t 
talk straight like other people — 
she could only sing about her 
dreams. But she taught your 
father a lot, and he was like her. 
Women were a little afraid to 
mate with him. My sister was the 
first to take a chance — and 
everyone said she deserved what 
she got.” 

Abruptly, Eric became con- 
scious of a change in the sounds 
outside the burrow. More quiet. 
Were they coming for him now? 

“Uncle Thomas, listen! I have 
an idea. Those Strangers — 
Walter, Arthur the Organizer — 
they gave me a Monster souvenir. 
I don’t know what it does, but I 
can’t get at it. I’ll turn around. 
You try to reach down into my 
knapsack with the tips of your 
fingers and — ” 

The Trap-Smasher paid no at- 
attention to him. “She was an 



Alien-sciencer,” he rambled on, 
mostly to himself. “Your grand- 
mother was the first Alien- 
sciencer we ever had in Mankind. 
I guess her tribe were all Alien- 
sciencers. Imagine — a whole 
tribe of Alien-sciencers!” 

Eric groaned. This half-alive, 
delirious man was his only hope 
of escaping. This bloody wreck 
who had once been the proudest, 
most alert band captain of them 
all. 

He turned for another look at 
the guard. The man was still 
staring down the length of the 
great central burrow. There was 
nothing to be heard now but a 
terrifying silence, as if dozens of 
pairs of eyes were glowing in an- 
ticipation. And footsteps — were 
not those footsteps? He had to 
find a way to make his uncle co- 
operate. 

66^^HOMAS the Trap-Smash- 
er!” he said sharply, barely 
managing to keep his voice low. 
“Listen to me. This is an order! 
There’s something in my knap- 
sack, a blob of sticky stuff. We’re 
going to turn our backs to each 
other, and you’re going to reach 
in with your fingers and fish it 
out. Do you hear me? That’s an 
order — a warrior’s order!” 

His uncle nodded, completely 
docile. “I’ve been a warrior for 
over twenty auld lang synes,” he 
mumbled, twisting around. “Six

of them a band captain. I’ve given 
orders and taken them, given 
them and taken them. I’ve never 
disobeyed an order. What I al- 
ways say is how can you expect 
to give orders if you don’t — ” 
“Now,” Eric told him, bringing 
their backs together and hunch- 
ing down so that his knapsack 
would be just under his uncle’s 
bound arms. “Reach in. Work 
that mass of sticky stuff out. It’s 
right on top. And hurry!” 

Yes. Those were footsteps com- 
ing up outside. Several of them. 
The leaders of the Female Soci- 
ety, the chief, an escort of war- 
riors. And the guard, watching 
that deadly procession, was liable 
to remember his duties and turn 
back to the prisoners. 

“Hurry, ” he demanded. “I told 
you to hurry, dammit! That’s an 
order, too. Get it out fast. Fast!” 
And, all this time, as the Trap- 
Smasher’s fumbling fingers wan- 
dered about in his knapsack, as 
he listened with fright and im- 
patience to the sounds of the ap- 
proaching execution party — all 
this time, somewhere in his mind, 
there was wonderment at the 
orders he was rapping out to an 
experienced band captain and the 
incredible authority he had man- 
aged to get into his voice. 

“Now you’re wondering where 
your grandmother’s tribe have 
their burrow,” Thomas began 
suddenly, reverting to an earlier 

THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



topic as if they were having a 
pleasant conversation after a fine, 
full meal. 

“Forget it! Get that stuff out. 
Just get it out!” 

“It’s hard to describe,” the 
other man’s voice wandered on. 
“A long way off, their burrow is, 
a long way off. You know the 
Strangers call us front-burrow 
people. You know that, don’t 
you? The Strangers are back- 
burrowers. Well, your grand- 
mother’s people are the bottom- 
most burrowers of all.” 

Eric sensed his fingers closing 
in the knapsack. 

The three women who ruled the 
Female Society came into the 
storage burrow. Ottilie the Omen- 
Teller, Sarah the Sickness-Healer 
and Rita the Record- Keeper. 
With them was the chief and two 
band captains, heavily armed. 

IX 

i^TTILIE, the Chieftain’s First 
Wife, was in the lead. She 
stopped, just inside the entrance 
to the burrow and the others 
came to a halt around her. 

“Look at them,” she jeered. 
“They’re trying to free each 
other! And what do they plan to 
do if they get themselves untied?” 
Franklin moved to her side and 
took a long, judicious look at the 
two men squatting back to back. 
“They’ll try to escape,” he ex- 

73 



72 



plained, continuing his wife’s 
joke. “They’ll have their hands 
free, they figure, and surely 
Thomas the Trap-Smasher and 
his nephew are a match, even 
bare-handed, for the best spear- 
men in Mankind!’’ 

And then Eric felt the search- 
ing hands come up out of the 
knapsack to which his own arms 
were tied. Something fell to the 
floor of the burrow. It made an 
odd noise, halfway between a 
splash and a thud. He twisted 
around for it immediately with 
his mouth open, flexing his knees 
in a tight crouch underneath his 
body. 

“You’ve never seen anything 
like the burrows of your grand- 
mother’s people,” his uncle was 
mumbling, as if what his hands 
had just done was no concern of 
the rest of him. “And neither have 
I, though I’ve listened to the 
tales.” 

“He won’t last long now,” 
Sarah the Sickness-Healer com- 
mented. “We’ll have to have our 
fun with the boy.” 

All you do, Walter the Weap- 
on-Seeker had said, is tear off a 
pinch with your fingers. Then spit 
on it and throw it. Throw it as 
fast and as far as you can. 

He couldn’t use his fingers. But 
he leaned down to the red blob 
and nipped off a piece with his 
teeth. He brought his tongue 
against the strange soft substance. 



lashing saliva into it. And simul- 
taneously he kicked at the bur- 
row floor with curved toes, 
straightening his legs, jerking his 
thighs and body upward. Unable 
to use his arms for balance, he 
tottered erect and turned, sway- 
ing, to face the leaders of his 
people. 

After you spit on it, throw it 
fast. As fast and as far as you can. 

“I don’t know what he’s doing,” 
someone said, “but I don’t like it. 
Let me through.” 

Stephen the Strong-Armed 
stepped ahead of the group and 
lifted a heavy spear, ready for 
throwing. 

Eric shut his eyes, bent his 
head far back on his neck and 
took a deep, deep breath. Then 
he snapped his head forward, flip- 
ping his tongue hard against the 
object in his mouth. He forced 
out his breath so abruptly that 
the exhalation became a wild, 
barking cough. 

The soft little mass flew out of 
his mouth, and he opened his 
eyes to watch its course. For a 
moment, he was unable to find it 
an3Twhere; then he located it by 
the odd expression on Stephen’s 
face and the fearful upward roll 
of his eyes. 

There was a little red splotch 
in the middle of the band cap- 
tain’s forehead. 

What was supposed to happen, 
he wondered? He had followed 

GALAXY 



directions as well as he could 
under the circumstances, but he 
had no idea what the scarlet 
stain, made loose and moist by 
his saliva, was supposed to ac- 
complish. He watched it, hoping 
and waiting. 

Then Stephen the Strong- 
Armed brought his free hand up 
slowly to wipe the stuff off. Eric 
stopped hoping. Nothing was go- 
ing to happen. 

Strangers, he had begun to 
think despairingly, that’s what 
comes of trusting Strangers — 

T he blast of sound was so tre- 
mendous that for a moment he 
thought the roof of the burrow 
had fallen in. He was slammed 
backwards against the wall and 
fell as if he’d been walloped with 
a spear haft. He remembered the 
cough with which he’d expelled 
the bit of red blob from his 
mouth. Had there been a delayed 
echo to his cough, a gigantic, ear- 
splitting echo? 

He lifted his head from the 
floor finally, when the reverbera- 
tions in the little storage burrow 
had rumbled into a comparative 
silence. Someone was screaming. 
Someone was screaming over and 
over again. 

It was Sarah. She was looking 
at Stephen the Strong-Armed 
from the rear. She had been 
standing directly behind him. 
Now she was staring at him and 

THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



screaming in sharp steady bursts. 

Her mouth was open so wide 
that it seemed she was about to 
tear her jaws apart. And with each 
scream she lifted her arm rigidly 
and pointed to the back of Ste- 
phen’s neck. She kept lifting her 
arm and pointing as if she wanted 
everyone present to know beyond 
the least doubt why and how she 
came to be screaming. 

Stephen the Strong-Armed had 
no head. His body ended at the 
neck, and flaps of skin fell down 
to his chest in an irregular wavy 
pattern. A fountain of blood 
bubbled and spurted where his 
head had been. His body still 
stood upright, feet planted wide 
apart in a good warrior’s stance, 
one arm holding the spear ready 
for action and the other con- 
gealed in its upward motion to 
wipe the red blob away. It stood, 
incredibly straight and tall and 
alive. 

Suddenly, it fell apart. 

First the spear slid slowly for- 
ward out of the right hand and 
clattered to the floor. Then the 
arms began to fall loosely to the 
sagging knees and the entire 
great, brawny body slumped as 
if its bones had left it. It dropped 
aimlessly to the floor, an arm 
poking out here, a leg twisting 
out there, in a pattern as mean- 
ingless as if an oddly shaped bag 
of skin had been flung to one side 
of the burrow. 



74

It continued to twitch for a 
moment or two, as the bubbling 
fountain of blood turned into a 
sluggishly flowing river. At last 
it lay still, a motionless heap of 
limbs and torso. Of the missing 
head there was no trace any- 
where. 

CARAH the Sickness - Healer 
^ stopped screaming and turned, 
shaking, to her companions. Their 
protruding eyes left the body on 
the floor. 

Then they all reacted at once. 

They yelled madly, wildly, 
fearfully, as if they were a chorus 
and she the conductor. Still bel- 
lowing, they made for the narrow 
entrance behind them. They got 
through in a pushing, punching 
scramble that at one point looked 
like a composite monster with 
dozens of arms, legs and swinging, 
naked breasts. They carried the 
guard outside with them, and 
with them, too, they carried their 
uncontrollable panic, screaming 
it into existence all along the 
great central burrow. 

For a little while, Eric could 
hear feet pounding into the dis- 
tant corridors. Then there was 
quiet. There was quiet every- 
where, except for Thomas the 
Trap - Smasher’s interminable 
mumbling. 

Eric forced himself upright 
again. He was unable to imagine 
what had happened. That red 



blob — the Stranger, Walter, had 
said it was a weapon, but it didn’t 
operate like any weapon he had 
ever in his life heard of. Except 
possibly in the times of the an- 
cestors: the ancestors were sup. 
posed to have had things which 
could blow an object apart and 
leave no trace. But this was an 
alien artifact, a possession of the 
Monsters which Walter the 
Weapon - Seeker had somehow 
found and appropriated. What 
was it? How had it exploded the 
head of Stephen the Strong- 
Armed? 

That was to be worked out an- 
other time. Meanwhile, he had 
his chance. It might not last long: 
he had no idea when the panic 
might subside and a patrol of war- 
riors be sent back to investigate. 
He stepped carefully across the 
red stream flowing from the fallen 
man’s neck. Squatting down in 
front of the dropped spear, he 
managed to get a grip on it with 
his bound hands and rose, holding 
it awkwardly behind him. 

No time to cut his bonds. Not 
here. 

“Uncle Thomas,” he called. 
“We can get away. We have a 
chance now. Come on, get up!” 

The wounded band captain 
stared up at him without compre- 
hension. “ — corridors like you’ve 
never seen or imagined,” he con- 
tinued in a low monotone. “Glow 
lamps that aren’t on foreheads. 



76 



GALAXY 



Corridors filled with glow lamps. 
Corridors and corridors and cor- 
ridors — ” 

For a moment, Eric con- 
sidered. The man would be a 
heavy liability in fast travel. But 
he couldn’t desert him. This was 
his last surviving relative, the 
only person who didn’t consider 
him an outlaw and a thing. And, 
shattered as he was, also still his 
captain. 

“Get up!” he said again. “Tho- 
mas the Trap-Smasher, get up! 
That’s an order, a warrior’s order. 
Get up!” 

As he’d hoped, his uncle re- 
sponded to the old command. He 
managed to get his legs under his 
body, and strained against them, 
but it was no use. He didn’t have 
the energy to rise. 

^ASTING apprehensive looks 
over his shoulder at the en- 
trance to the storage burrow, Eric 
ran to the struggling man. Work- 
ing backwards, he managed to 
get one end of the spear under 
the crook of his uncle’s arm. 
Then, using his own hip as a ful- 
crum, he levered hard at the 
other end. 

It was painful, slippery work, 
since he couldn’t bring all of his 
muscles into play and it was diffi- 
cult to see what he was doing. In 
between efforts, he gasped out or- 
ders to “Get up, get up, get up, 
damn you!” At last the end of 



the spear went all the way down. 
His uncle was on his feet, stagger- 
ing, but at least on his feet. 

Dragging the spear awkwardly, 
Eric urged and butted him out of 
the place. The great central bur- 
row was empty of people. Weap- 
ons, p)ots and miscellaneous pos- 
sessions lay strewn about where 
they had been dropped. The fin- 
ished structure of the Stage stood 
deserted in front of the royal 
mound. And some time before, 
the bodies of his uncle’s wives 
had evidently been removed. 

The chief and the other leaders 
had bolted to the left once they 
had clawed their way out of the 
storage burrow. They had ap- 
parently run past the scaffold 
structure and picked up the rest 
of Mankind in their panic. 

Eric turned right. 

His uncle was a problem. Tho- 
mas the Trap-Smasher kept com- 
ing to a bewildered halt. Again 
and again he began the story of 
his long-ago journey to the bur- 
rows of the strange, distant tribe. 
Eric had to push against him to 
keep him moving. 

Once they were in the outlying 
corridors, he felt better. But not 
until they had made many turns, 
passed dozens of branches and 
were well into completely unin- 
habited burrows, did he feel he 
could stop and saw himself free 
of his bonds on the point of the 
spear. He did the same for his 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



77 



uncle. Then, throwing the Trap- 
Smasher’s left arm across his own 
shoulders and clutching him 
tightly about the waist, he started 
off again. It was slow going: his 
uncle was a heavy man, but the 
more distance they could put be- 
tween themselves and Mankind, 
the better. 

But distance where? Where 
should they go? He pondered the 
problem as they tottered to- 
gether down the silent, branching 
corridors. One place was as good 
as another. There was nowhere 
that they would be welcome. Just 
keep going. 

He may have muttered his 
questions aloud. To his surprise, 
Thomas the Trap-Smasher sud- 
denly said in an entirely coherent 
but very weak voice: “The door- 
way to Monster territory, Eric. 
Make for the doorway to Mon- 
ster territory where you went to 
make your Theft.” 

“Why?” Eric asked. “What can 
we do there?” 

There was no answer. His un- 
cle’s head fell forward on his 
chest. He was evidently sliding 
into a stupor again. And yet, 
somehow, as long as Eric’s en- 
circling arm pulled at his body, 
the man’s legs kept moving for- 
ward. There was some residual 
stamina and a warrior’s deter- 
mination in him yet. 

Monster territory. Was there 
more safety for them there now 



than they could find among hu- 
man beings? 

Very well then. The doorway I 
to Monster territory. They would 
have to come around in a wide 
arc through many corridors to get 
to it, but Eric knew the way. He 
was Eric the Eye, after all, he told i 
himself: it was his business al- j 
ways to know the way. 

But was it? He had not en- | 
joyed the formal initiation into 
manhood that was the usual after- 
math of a successful Theft With- 
out that, perhaps he was still Eric | 
the Only, still a boy and an ini- 
tiate. No, he knew what he was. 
He was Eric the Outlaw, nothing 
else. j 

He was an outlaw, without a ; 
home and a people. And, except 
for the dying man he pulled ' 
along, everyone’s hand was hence- 
forth against him. 

X 

^HOMAS the Trap-Smasher 
had been badly injured in 
the surprise attack that had 
wiped out his band. Ordinarily, 
he would have had his wounds 
carefully dressed by the clever- j 
ness and accumulated experience 
of Sarah the Sickness-Healer. Un- 
der the circumstances, however, 
Sarah had done the reverse. 

Now, the strain of escape and 
the forced headlong flight that j 
followed it had emptied his body 



78 



GALAXY 



of its last resources. His eyes 
were glazed and his strong 
shoulders hung slack. He was a 
somnambulist walking jerkily in 
the direction of death. 

When they stopped to rest, 
Eric — after listening intently 
for any sounds of pursuit — had 
washed his uncle’s wounds care- 
fully with water from the can- 
teens and had bound the uglier 
gashes with strips torn from a 
knapsack. It was all he knew 
how to do: warrior’s first aid. A 
woman’s advanced therapeutic 
knowledge was needed for any- 
thing more complicated. 

Not that it would have made 
very much difference by this 
time. The Trap-Smasher was too 
far gone. 

Eric felt desperate at the 
thought of being left alone for- 
ever in the dark, uninhabited 
corridors. He tried to force water 
and bits of food upon his uncle. 
The man’s head rolled back, 
nourishment dribbling carelessly 
down from both sides of his 
mouth. He was breathing lightly 
and very rapidly. His body had 
grown quite warm by the time 
they stopped. 

Eric himself ate ravenously: it 
was his first meal in a long, long 
while. He kept staring at his re- 
cumbent uncle and trying to 
work out a line of action that 
would do some good. In the end, 
he had thought of nothing better 



than to hitch the man’s arm up 
over his shoulder again and to 
keep going in the direction of 
Monster territory. 

Once erect, the Trap-Smash- 
er’s feet began walking again, but 
with a dragging, soggy quality 
that became more and more pro- 
nounced. After a while, Eric had 
to come to a halt: he had the 
feeling that he was hauling dead 
weight. 

When he tried to lower his 
uncle to the floor of the burrow, 
he found that the body had be- 
come almost completely limp. 
Thomas lay on his back, his eyes 
staring without curiosity at the 
rounded ceiling upon which his 
forehead glow-lamp outlined a 
bright circular patch. 

The heartbeat was very, very 
faint. 

“Eric,” he heard a weak voice 
say. He raised his eyes from his 
uncle’s chest and looked at the 
painfully working mouth. 

“Yes, uncle?” 

“I’m sorry — about — what I 
got you into. I had — no right. 
Your life — after all — your life. 
You — my wives — the band. I 
led — death — everyone. I’m 
sorry.” 

Eric fought hard to hold back 
his tears. “It was for a reason. 
Uncle Thomas,” he said. “We had 
a cause. It wasn’t just you. The 
cause failed.” 

There was a hideous cackle 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS 



79 






from the prone man. For a mo- 
ment, Eric thought it was a death 
rattle. Then he realized that it 
had been a laugh, but such a 
laugh as he had never heard be- 
fore. 

“A cause?” the Trap-Smasher 
gasped. “A cause? Do you know 

— do you — know what — the 
cause was? I wanted — wanted 
to be chief. Chief. The only — 
only way I could — do it. — 
Alien-science — the Strangers — 
a cause. Everyone — the killings 

— I wanted to — to be chief. 
Chiei!” 

He went rigid as he coughed 
out the last word. Then slowly, 
like flesh turning into liquid, he 
relaxed. 

He was dead. 

Tj^RIC stared at the body a long 
^ time. It didn’t make any dif- 
ference, he found. The numbness 
in his mind remained. There was 
a great paralyzed spot in the 
center of his brain that was un- 
able to think or to feel. 

In the end, he shook himself, 
bent down and grabbed the body 
by the shoulders. Walking back- 
wards, he dragged it in the di- 
rection of Monster territory. 

Something he had to do. The 
duty of anyone who lived in the 
burrows when death occurred in 
his neighborhood. Now it filled 
time and used up energies that 
he might otherwise have ex- 



pended in thoughts which were 
agonizing. 

The energies which it de- 
manded were almost more than 
he was capable of at this point. 
His uncle had been a heavy, well 
built man. Eric found that he 
had to stop at the end of almost 
every curving corridor and get 
his breath back. 

He finally arrived at the door- 
way, grateful for the fact that 
his uncle had died so relatively 
close to it. He also felt he under- 
stood why this had been sug- 
gested as their destination. Thom- 
as the Trap-Smasher had known 
he had little time left. His nephew 
would have the responsibility of 
sewering him. He had tried to 
make it as easy for Eric as pos- 
sible by going the greater part of 
the distance on his own feet. 

There was a fresh-water pipe 
in the wall near the doorway to 
Monster territory. And wherever 
there was a fresh-water pipe, the 
Monsters were likely to have 
laid a sewer pipe nearby. It was 
down this, probably, that the 
men killed in the battle with 
Stephen the Strong-Armed’s 
band had been disposed of much 
earlier. And it was down this that 
Thomas had known his remains 
must also go — the closest point 
at which his nephew could sewer 
him in comparative safety. 

This much, at least, he had 
done for Eric’s benefit.

GALAXY 



Eric located the fresh-water 
pipe without much difficulty. 
There was a constant low rumb- 
ling and gurgling underfoot, and 

at the spot where it was most 

pronounced — he found the slab 
in the floor cut at the cost of 
infinite labor by some past gen- 
eration of Mankind. Near it, after 
the slab was lifted, was another, 
much thicker pipe, large enough 
to carry two men abreast. Like 
the other one, the hard stuff of 
the burrow floor had been scraped 
away so that a joint lay exposed. 

Opening the joint was another 
matter. Eric had seen it done 
many times by his elders, but this 
was his own first attempt. It was 
a tricky business of tugging a 
heavy covering plate first right, 
then left, and getting his fingers 
under the rim and pulling at just 
the right moment. 

^HE joint opened at last, and 
the incredible stink of Mon- 
ster sewage poured out as the 
liquid swirled darkly by. Death 
had always been associated in 
Eric’s mind with this stink, since 
the pipe carried not only the 
Monster’s waste matter but also 
that of Mankind, collected from 
its burrows every week by the 
old women who were too feeble 
for any other work. All that was 
not alive or useful was carried to 
the nearest Monster sewer pipe, 
all that might decay and foul the 



burrows. And that included, of 
course, the bodies of the dead. 

Eric stripped his uncle’s body 
of all useful gear as he had seen 
the women do many times. Then 
he dragged it to the hole in the 
burrow floor and held it by one 
arm for a moment as the current 
of the sewage caught it. He re- 
peated as much of the ceremony 
as he could remember, conclud- 
ing with the words: “And there- 
fore, O ancestors, I beg you to 
receive the body of this member 
of Mankind, Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher, a warrior of the first 
rank, a band captain of renown 
and the father of nine.” 

There was usually another 
line or so — “Take him to you 
and keep him with you until the 
time when the Monsters have 
been destroyed utterly and the 
Earth is ours again. Then shall 
you and he and all human beings 
who have ever lived rise from 
the sewers and joyously walk the 
surface of our world forever.” But 
this, after all, was a pure An- 
cestor-science passage; and his 
uncle had died fighting Ancestor- 
science. What was the Alien-sci- 
ence equivalent? And it likely 
to be any more potent, any less 
full of falsehood? In the end, Eric 
omitted those last two lines. 

He let go of the stiffening arm. 
The body shot away and down 
the pipe. Thomas the Trap- 
Smasher was gone, he was gone 



THE MEN IN THE WALLS

for all time, the way Eric 
reasoned now. He was dead and 
sewered, and that was that. 

Eric closed the joint, pulled 
the slab down and stamped it 
into place. 

He was completely alone. An 
outlaw who could expect nothing 
from other human beings but 
death by slow torture. He had no 
companions, no home, no beliefs 
of any sort. His uncle’s last words 
still lay, in all their stern ugliness, 
at the bottom of his mind. “I 
wanted to — to be chief.” 

TT was bad enough to discover 
that the religion on which he 
had been raised was a mere prop 
to the power of the chieftainship, 
that the mysterious Female So- 
ciety was completely unable to 
see into a person’s future. But to 
find out that his uncle’s thought- 
ful antagonism to such nonsense 
was based on nothing more sub- 
stantial than simple personal 
ambition, an ambition murder- 
ously unscrupulous and willing to 
sacrifice anybody who trusted 
him — well, what was there left 
to believe in, to base a life upon? 

Had his father and mother 
been any less gullible than the 
most naive child in the burrows? 
They had sacrificed themselves 
— for what? For one super- 
stition as opposed to another, for 
the secret p>olitical maneuvers of 
this person as opposed to that. 



Not for him. He would be free. 
He laughed, bitterly and self- 
consciously. He had to be free. 
There was no choice: he was an 
outlaw. 

Eric walked a few steps and 
put his hands on the door to 
Monster territory. To shift it out 
of its socket was a hard job for 
one man. He strained and tore 
his fingers; finally he managed 
it. The door came away and he 
deposited it carefully on the floor 
of the burrow. 

He stared at it for a while, 
trying to figure out a way of 
getting it back after he’d passed 
through the doorway. No, a 
single man just couldn’t do that 
from the other side. He’d have 
to leave the doorway open, an 
incredible social crime. 

Well, he couldn’t commit a 
crime any more. He was beyond 
all rules made by human com- 
munities. Ahead lay the glaring 
white light that he and his kind 
feared so much. Into this he 
would go. Here, where there 
were no illusions to be found and 
no help to be expected, here he 
would make his solitary outlaw 
home. 

Behind him lay the dark, safe, 
intricate burrows. They were 
tunnels, Eric knew now, in the 
walls that surrounded Monster 
territory. Men lived in these 
walls, and shivered, and were ig- 
norant, and made fools of each 



r 

Q^jier. He could no longer do 
°j,ese things; he had to face the 
' Monsters. He wanted to face 
them and destroy them. 

It was like one of the roaches 
in the storage burrow declaring 
war on a cook who came in to 
niake the evening meal for Man- 
kind. The cook would roar with 
laughter at such a thought. Who 
knew what went on in the mind 
of a roach — and who cared? Yet 
the roach would enjoy two special 
advantages. He had once and for 
all stopped crawling greedily and 



aimlessly with his own kind; and 
the enemy he had selected could 
regard him with nothing more 
than heavy oblivious contempt. 
If he could ever for a moment 
find one usable weapon and one 
vital area on which that weapon 
could be used . 

He hefted his two special ad- 
vantages grimly. Then Eric the 
Only, the Eye, the Outlaw, Eric 
the Self-Aware Individual Man, 
stepped through the doorway in- 
to Monster territory.

Last summer we printed what we said was going to be one of the 
best-liked science-fiction stories of the year -Jack Vance's The Dragon 
Masters - and, by gosh, we were right; your letters were enthusiastic, and 
both the story and the fine Gaughan illustrations that went with it went 
right on to pick up best-of-the-year nominations. 

Next issue Vance is back with a big one called The Star King, In 
The Dragon Masters Vance had one world under observation; here he 
shows us the baroque and fascinating life of a galaxy, bright with imagin- 
ative color, brilliant with invention. You'll like this one, too! 

In the same issue a complete short novel by Fritz Leiber, No Great 
Magic, and as much more as the type will contain. Which will be somewhat 
more than heretofore, by the way. Next issue will show a slight change in 
format — same overall size, same number of pages, same price, but a dif- 
ferent method of printing and a slightly more compact type -which will 
make it a bigger bargain than ever. (As you know. Galaxy already contains 
both more pages and more actual words of science fiction per issue than

KING OF THE RATS 



T^R those who know Tchai- 
kovsky’s Nutcracker Ballet 
only from re.cords and have never 
seen it staged it may be neces- 
sary to explain that there is a 
Mouse King on stage. It has 
many heads — mouse-heads, of 
course — and for that reason it 
doesn’t have much to do. But the 
choreographer’s problems are be- 
side the point here, as is the fact 
that the ballet is based on a 
French rewrite of a story by 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



85 





E. T. A. Hoffmann, he of the 
Tales of Hoffmann. 

What is to the point is that the 
Mouse King of the ballet was a 
Rat King in the original story, 
and that there is a little known 
fact of Natural History hiding be- 
hind the fantasy. 

Quite a number of years ago, 
at a Christmas party where the 
hostess told me that she had 
taken her children to see the 
ballet, I tried to tell that fact, 
but was interrupted with the re- 
mark that this was “not a nice 
story.” I just found out that 
Richard Lydekker, who edited 
the multi-volume Library of Nat- 
ural History which was published 
in New York in 1902, also did 
not consider it a “nice story”, for 
while he followed his original, Dr. 
Alfred Brehm’s Tierleben, quite 
faithfully, he left out the three 
pages of the original which deal 
with the Rat King. 

A Rat King is not a separate 
species. One is tempted to say “on 
the contrary,” for it consists of a 
number of rats which cannot be 
separated. 

The average number of rats 
forming a “king” is twelve, but 
larger and smaller numbers have 
been found. The tails of the ani- 
mals are intertwined in such a 
manner that the individuals can- 
not pull free. The whole thing is 
about two feet in diameter. All 
the heads point outward, natu- 



rally, since the tails are stuck 
together. Being handicapped in 
this manner, the animals are not 
very mobile and in a few cases a 
dead and dried-out “king” has 
been found. Evidently the rats 
had starved to death. But in the 
majority of the cases the “king” 
when found was still alive. It 
often was found because the 
members composing it were 
squealing with hunger. 

A NUMBER of writers have 
dismissed the Rat King as 
“legendary” but that seems to be 
due to a confusion, just as the 
term Rat King itself is somewhat 
confused — as I’ll explain short- 
ly. There is a European legend 
about a “king of the rats” which 
is old enough to be untraceable 
because its roots disappear in the 
time before printing. But the 
name was known to Konrad Ges- 
ner, the great Swiss zoologist of 
the sixteenth century. In his book 
on the four-footed animals, which 
was printed for the first time in 
1555, he said in his chapter on 
the rat — after remarking that 
rats do not need to be described 
because “to many they are better 
known than is pleasing” — that 
“some say that the rat, in its old 
age, grows enormously large [so 
that it can no longer move 
around] and is fed by the young- 
er rats; it is called a Rat King 
by our people.” 



86 



GALAXY 



This is a reference to the 
legend which other writers ex- 
panded, saying that the younger 
rats steal red cloth to drape on 
their king. Many a young Swiss 
probably gripped his stick more 
tightly when opening the door of 
a long unused barn or basement. 
There might be an enormous rat 
inside, immobile because of age 
and size, maybe, but still 
equipped with long teeth and pos- 
sibly defended by faithful retain- 
ers. Of course no rat king of that 
kind was ever found, though it 
made fine material for fairy tales. 
But once in a while peasant lads 
would find the nearly immobile 
assembly of rats with their tails 
stuck together. Was that the rat 
king’s throne? Or did the king of 
the rats look different from the 
fairy tales? In the end linguistic 
usage decided that it was the Rat 
King. 

Two types of rats were com- 
mon in Europe. In England they 
are distinguished simply by the 
color of their fur as Black and 
Brown rats. The latter goes under 
the name of Norway Rat in some 
books. Zoologists know that the, 
incidentally larger, brown rat is 
a fairly late immigrant to Europe. 
The same is believed of the black 
rat, but the date of immigration 
was early. The first mention of 
the black rat can be found in the 
works of Albert of Bollstadt, bet- 
ter known as Albertus Magnus, 



who died in 1280. Whether they 
arrived, presumably from the 
East, a centdry or five centuries 
before Albertus is something no- 
body knows. 

But the arrival of the brown 
rat has even been observed. The 
German physician Peter Simon 
Pallas, who explored Russia for 
the Court in St. Petersburg, re- 
ported that large numbers of 
brown rats could be seen travel- 
ing westward after an earthquake 
in the area of the Caspian Sea. 
The date was early autumn of 
1727. The brown rat appeared in 
East Prussia in 1750, in Paris in 
1753, in South Germany in 1780 
and in Switzerland in 1809. But 
in the meantime brown rats from 
the East Indies had reached Eng- 
land by ship in 1732 and had 
traveled from England to the 
United States in 1755. The brown 
rat is considerably larger than the 
black rat, and more destructive 
in the same ratio. It was only a 
minor consolation that the first 
victims of the brown rat’s appe- 
tite were usually the black rats. 

A ROUND the year 1850, the 
inhabitants of Denmark, 
Germany and Switzerland still 
referred to the two rats as “base- 
ment rats” and “attic rats”, the 
smaller black rat (Mus rattus) 
preferring the roof area, while the 
larger brown rat (Mus decuman- 
us) preferred the basements. By

the end of the nineteenth century 
the brown rat had won out. The 
black rat had become rare. And 
the Reverend J. G. Wood, who 
near the end of the nineteenth 
century wrote a book called Ani- 
mate Creation, was more than 
slightly wrong in writing that the 
“conquest had been brought 
about not by war but by love”, 
thinking that in interbreeding the 
characteristics of the brown rat 
had become dominant. It had 
been war, plain and simple. 

This excursion into the history 
of the two kinds of rats has been 
necessary for a specific reason. 
Whatever it is that causes a doz- 
en or so rats to become a Rat 
King affects the black rat only, 
as far as we can tell from old 
descriptions. It does not seem to 
touch the brown rat. And since 
the black rat has become com- 
paratively rare the chances for 
forming Rat Kings have dimin- 
ished too. This must be the 
reason why there are no recent 
reports. 

But since the majority of these 
reports are old how can we know 
that they are true? 

This is in itself a very valid 
suggestion. But fortunately we 
have the documents of the equiv- 
alent of a law suit involving a 
Rat King. 

On January 17, 1774, a young 
man came to the district office 
of the government of the king of 



Saxony in Leipzig with a com- 
plaint. His name, he stated, was 
Christian Kaiser and he was em- 
ployed as a helper at the wind- 
mill at Lindenau, a hamlet within 
walking distance from Leipzig. A 
week earlier he had found a live 
Rat King consisting of 16 rats 
whose tails were intertwined. He 
had shown it to his master, the 
miller Tobias Jaeger. The reason 
why he bothered the officials was 
to complain about one Johann 
Adam Fasshauer, a resident of 
Lindenau. Said Johann Adam 
Fasshauer had gone to the afore- 
mentioned miller Tobias Jaeger 
and persuaded him to hand over 
the Rat King to said Fasshauer 
because he wished to make a 
painting of it. But in reality Fass- 
hauer had exhibited the Rat 
King, charging admission, and 
petitioner was now petitioning 
the officials to force said Fass- 
hauer to return the Rat King, to 
hand over the money he had 
earned by its public exhibition 
and also to pay the expenses for 
the action of the officials. 

Before committing themselves 
on the legal steps to be taken the 
officials made sure that there was 
a Rat King. 

They first questioned Christian 
Kaiser under oath about details of 
the capture. He told that he was 
working in the mill on January 
12, 1774, when he heard a noise 
near a staircase and saw several 



88 



GALAXY 



rats looking out at him. Taking a 
piece of firewood, he killed them, 
and then took a ladder to see 
whether there might be more rats 
on a ledge, this time taking an 
axe as a weapon. There he found 
the Rat King. He pulled it off the 
ledge, using the axe so that it 
fell to the floor. He counted six- 
teen rats, fifteen of them with 
their tails “plaited together” and 
the sixteenth sticking to the back 
fur of one of the fifteen. Most of 
them survived the fall from the 
ledge and stayed alive for some 
time. But though they attempted 
to pull free of each other they did 
not succeed. 

rf^HE NEXT step of the officials 
•*- was to send a doctor to Lin- 
denau. Then the doctor wrote a 
protocol, saying that he had ar- 
rived in Lindenau and had been 
led to a room in the Posthorn 
Inn where he had found a Rat 
King consisting of sixteen dead 
rats. 

“Fifteen of them,” the doctor 
wrote, “had their tails knotted to- 
gether into a large knot in such 
a manner that most tails were 
completely in the knot except for 
a piece one or two inches in 
length near their bodies.” He then 
examined the rats in detail, and 
summarized the result of his ex- 
amination in the following four 
points: 

“( 1 ) that the bodies, heads and 



feet of the rats had their natural 
shapes, 

“(2) that some of them had the 
color of gray ashes, some were a 
little darker and some almost 
black, 

“(3) that they measured more 
than a span in length [this must 
refer to the length of the head 
and body without the tail; the 
normal figure for a black rat is 
about seven inches], 

“(4) that the proportions of 
their thickness to their length in- 
dicated that they were under- 
nourished rather than well nour- 
ished.” 

His conclusion was that “said 
sixteen rats were not one organ- 
ism which is called a Rat King 
but sixteen individual rats of dif- 
ferent size and coloration and (in 
my opinion) different age and 
sex.” As for the reason, he pointed 
out that there had been a cold 
sp>ell prior to the discovery. He 
thought that the rats had huddled 
together for warmth but that the 
urine of other rats hiding at a 
higher level had dripped down on 
the interwined tails and had 
frozen. 

I am sorry that I can’t report 
whether the officials decided that 
Johann Adam Fasshauer had to 
return the Rat King to Christian 
Kaiser along with the money he 
had earned by its exhibition. 
Since my source is a zoological 
book, the legal consequences have

been neglected, but the point is 
that after all these legalities and 
investigations the authenticity of 
the fact involved cannot easily be 
doubted. The good doctor’s ex- 
planation of how the Rat King 
came into being is admittedly 
weak, but we still don’t know 
what the actual reason is. Some 
later investigators have offered 
the guess that it might be the re- 
sult of a disease of some kind 
which is peculiar to the black rat. 

AT ANY event, the Rat King 
of Lindenau was not unique. 

During December, 1822, two 
Rat Kings were found by three 
farm hands engaged in threshing 
grain in the barn of the local 
forester. The place was the ham- 
let of Dollstedt, not quite ten 
miles from the city of Gotha. 
While doing their work, the men 
heard the squealing of rats and 
started a search, aided by the 
forester’s helper. They finally 
found that one of the main cross 
beams had a six-inch-deep hollow 
in its topside, evidently one that 
the rats had gnawed. They saw 
that this hollow was full of rats, 
and they were somewhat sur- 
prised that the rats made no at- 
tempt to run away. 

The men pushed the rats out, 
and saw that one was a Rat King 
of 28 rats and the other one, one 
of 14 rats. Both sets were de- 
scribed as consisting of fully 



grown rats, quite clean but also 
very hungry. Strangely enough 
they are also described as having 
been very docile, which probably 
means that the rats were in an 
advanced state of weakness from 
hunger. 

After the whole village had 
marveled at the find, the public 
spectacle ended by the execution 
of both Rat Kings, the execution 
being carried out with the flails. 
Then two of the men took pitch- 
forks and tried to pry the bodies 
of the smaller assembly apart 
After much effort they succeeded 
in pulling out a few of the rats. 
The forester himself looked at 
them and wrote down that the 
tails had not been torn off in the 
process and even had their skin, 
but they “showed the impressions 
of the other tails, just like leather 
straps that had been plaited to- 
gether for a long time.” 

A later case has the advantage 
of having been examined by a 
man with scientific knowledge. 
The Rat King was found on Feb- 
ruary 2, 1880 by a drayman in a 
room of the abattoir of the city- 
of Diisseldorf. It was a room 
which was used for the storage of 
skins and which was, for this rea- 
son, not much frequented by peo- 
ple. The Rat King consisted of 
eight black rats, of which one was 
killed when it was discovered. 
The other seven lived for some 
time. A Mr. Wilhelm Deckers ac- 



quired it and went to a taxider- 
mist to have it preserved. The 
taxidermist, naturally, cleaned it 
up so that one cannot tell wheth- 
ei the intertwined tails were also 
held together by anything that 
might act like glue. 

After Mr. Deckers died, the 
specimen was donated to the lo- 
cal High School and examined by 
the school’s science teacher. Prof. 
Ahrend. Ahrend wrote that “Gun- 
termann [the taxidermist] had 
cleaned the tails of the animals 
carefully so that only their inter- 
twined positions were preserved 
. but just looking at the inter- 
twined tails makes it clear that 
even the smallest amount of a 
sticky substance would render 
the animals inseparable.” 

The latest case which I could 
find in a quick survey was re- 
ported by the German zoologist 
Dr. Ludwig Heck, who later be- 
came the director of the Zoologi- 
cal Garden in Berlin. It refers to 
a Rat King found in January, 
1907, in the village of Capelle, 
near Hamm in Westphalia. The 
local pastor, Wigger by name, in- 



formed the zoologist Reeker, who 
tried to acquire it for the Pro- 
vincial Museum of Westphalia. 
But before Reeker could move, 
the Zoological Institute of the 
University of Gottingen had se- 
cured it for its own collection. 

It consisted of ten specimens 
of the black rat. The director of 
the Zoological Institute, Privy 
Councillor Ehlers, wrote to Dr. 
Heck in reply to a question that 
he could not explain how such 
a thing could have happened and 
that the rat’s tails do not show 
any visible pathological changes. 
And he added that the Institute’s 
taxidermist considered it impos- 
sible that this Rat King might 
have been made by some prank- 
sters. 

Well, this is the story. 

All the cases have two things in 
common. It is always the black 
Mus ratius which produces a 
Rat King, and they have all been 
found during the coldest time of 
the year, in weather which would 
.make the animals huddle togeth- 
er for warmth.

Consider Mizzer, the resort

Wedder reformed the culture so 
violently that whatever had been 
slovenly now became atrocious. 

Consider Genevieve, so rich 
that she was the prisoner of her 
own wealth, so beautiful that she 
was the victim of her own beauty, 
so intelligent that she knew there 
was nothing, nothing to be done 
about her fate. 

Consider Casher O’Neill, a 
wanderer among the planets, 
thirsting for justice and yet hop- 
ing in his innermost thoughts that 
“justice” was not just another 
word for revenge. 

Consider Pontoppidan, that lit- 
eral gem of a planet, where the 
people were too rich and busy 
to have good food, open air or 
much fun. All they had was dia- 
monds, rubies, tourmalines and 
emeralds.

TJ^HEN Casher O’Neill came to 
™ Pontoppidan, he found 
that the capital city was appropri- 
ately called Andersen. 



ON THE GEM PLANET 



93 




This was the second century of 
the Rediscovery of Man. People 
everywhere had taken up old 
names, old languages, old cus- 
toms, as fast as the robots and 
the underpeople could retrieve 
the data from the rubbish of for- 
gotten starlanes or the subsurface 
ruins of Manhome itself. 

Casher knew this very well, to 
his bitter cost. Re-acculturation 
had brought him revolution and 
exile. He came from, the dry, 
beautiful planet of Mizzer. He 
was himself the nephew of the 
ruined ex-ruler, Kuraf, whose col- 
lection of objectionable books 
had at one time been unmatched 
in the settled galaxy; he had 
stood aside, half-assenting, when 
the colonels Gibna and Wedder 
took over the planet in the name 
of reform; he had implored the 
Instrumentality, vainly, for help 
when Wedder became a tyrant; 
and now he traveled among the 
stars, looking for men or weapons 
who might destroy Wedder and 
make Kaheer again the luxurious, 
happy city which it once had 
been. 

He felt that his cause was 
hopeless when he landed on Pon- 
toppidan. The people were warm- 
hearted, friendly, intelligent, but 
they had no motives to fight for, 
no weapons to fight with, no ene- 
mies to fight against. They had 
little public spirit, such as Casher 
O’Neill had seen back on his na- 



tive planet of Mizzer. They were 
concerned about little things. 

Indeed, at the time of his ar- 
rival, the Pontoppidans were 
wildly excited about a horse. 

A horse! Who worries about 
one horse? 

Casher O’Neill himself* said so. 
“Why bother about a horse? We 
have lots of them on Mizzer. 
They are four-handed beings, 
eight times the weight of a man, 
with only one finger on each of 
the four hands. The fingernail is 
very heavy and permits them to 
run fast. That’s why our people 
have them, for running.” 

“Why run?” said the Heredi- 
tary Dictator of Pontoppidan, 
“Why ruri, when you can fly? 
Don’t you have ornithopters?” 
“We don’t run with them,” said 
Casher indignantly. “We make 
them run against each other and 
then we pay prizes to the one 
which runs fastest.” 

“But then,” said Phillip Vin- 
cent, the Hereditary Dictator, 
“you get a very illogical situation. 
When you have tried out these 
four-fingered beings, you know 
how fast each one goes. So what? 
Why bother?” 

His niece interrupted. She was 
a fragile little thing, smaller than 
Casher O’Neill liked women to 
be. She had clear gray eyes, well- 
marked eyebrows, a very artificial 
coiffeur of silver-blonde hair and 
the most sensitive little mouth he 



had ever seen. She conformed to 
the local fashion by wearing some 
kind of powder or face cream 
which was flesh-pink in color but 
which had overtones of lilac. On 
a woman as old as twenty-two, 
such a coloration would have 
made the wearer look like an old 
hag, but on Genevieve it was 
pleasant, if rather startling. It 
gave the effect of a happy child 
playing grown-up and doing the 
job joyfully and well. Casher 
knew that it was hard to tell ages 
in these off-trail planets. Gene- 
vieve might be' a grand dame in 
her third or fourth rejuvenation. 

He doubted it, on second 
glance. What she said was sensi- 
ble, young, and pert: 

“But uncle, they’re animalsl” 

“I know that,” he rumbled. 

“But uncle, don’t you see it?” 

“Stop saying ‘but uncle’ and 
tell me what you mean,” growled 
the Dictator, very fondly. 

“Animals are always uncer- 
tain.” 

“Of course,” said the uncle. 

“That makes it a game, uncle,” 
said Genevieve. “They’re never 
sure that any one of them would 
do the same thing twice. Imagine 
the excitement — the beautiful 
big beings from earth running 
around and around on their four 
middle fingers, the big fingernails 
making the gems jump loose from 
the ground!” 

“I’m not at all sure it’s that 



way. Besides, Mizzer may be cov- 
ered with something valuable, 
such as earth or sand, instead of 
gemstones like the ones we have 
here on Pontoppidan. You know 
your flower-pots with their rich, 
warm, wet, soft earth?” 

“Of course I do, uncle. And I 
know what you paid for them. 
You were very generous. And still 
are,” she added diplomatically, 
glancing quickly at Casher O’- 
Neill to see how the familial piety 
went across with the visitor. 

“We’re not that rich on Mizzer. 
It’s mostly sand, with farmland 
along the Twelve Niles, our big 
rivers.” 

“I’ve seen pictures of rivers,” 
said Genevieve. “Imagine living 
on a whole world full of flowerpot 
stuff!” 

“You’re getting off the subject, 
darling. We were wondering why 
anyone would bring one horse, 
just one horse, to Pontoppidan. I 
suppose you could race a horse 
against himself, if you had a stop- 
watch. But would it be fun? 
Would you do that, young man?” 
Casher O’Neill tried to be re- 
spectful. “In my home we used 
to have a lot of horses. I’ve seen 
my uncle time them one by one.” 
“Your uncle?” said the Dicta- 
tor interestedly. “Who was your 
uncle that he had all these four- 
fingered ‘horses’ running around? 
They’re all Earth animals and 
very expensive.”

RASHER felt the coming of the 
low, slow blow he had met 
so many times before, right from 
the whole outside world into the 
pit of his stomach. “My uncle — ” 
he stammered — “my uncle — I 
thought you knew — was the old 
Dictator of Mizzer, Kuraf.” 

Philip Vincent jumped to his 
feet, very lightly for so well- 
fleshed a man. The young mis- 
tress, Genevieve, clutched at the 
throat of her dress. 

“Kuraf!” cried the old Dictator. 
“Kuraf! We know about him, 
even here. But you were sup- 
posed to be a Mizzer patriot, not 
one of Kuraf’s people.” 

“He doesn’t have any children 
— ” Casher began to explain. 

“I should think not, not with 
those habits!” snapped the old 
man. 

“ — so I’m his nephew and his 
heir. But I’m not trying to put the 
Dictatorship back, even though I 
should be dictator. I just want to 
get rid of Colonel Wedder. He 
has ruined my people, and I am 
looking for money or weapons or 
help to make my home-world 
free.” This was the point, Casher 
O’Neill knew, at which people 
either started believing him or 
did not. If they did not, there was 
not much he could do about it. 
If they did, he was sure to get 
some sympathy. So far, no help. 
Just sympathy. 

But the Instrumentality, while 



refusing to take action against 
Colonel Wedder, had given young 
Casher O’Neill an all-world travel 
pass — something which a hun- 
dred lifetimes of savings could 
not have purchased for the ordi- 
nary man. (His obscene old uncle 
had gone off to Sunvale, on Ttiol- 
le, the resort planet, to live out 
his years between the casiho and 
the beach.) Casher O’Neill held 
the conscience of Mizzer in his 
hand. Only he, among the star 
travelers, cared enough to fight 
for the freedom of the Twelve 
Niles. Here, now, in this room, 
there was a turning point. 

“I won’t give you anything,” 
said the Hereditary Dictator, but 
he said it in a friendly voice. His 
niece started tugging at his sleeve. 

The older man went on. “Stop 
it, girl. I won’t give you anything, 
not if you’re part of that rotten 
lot of Kuraf’s, not unless — ” 
“Anything, sir, anything, just so 
that I get help or weapons to go 
home to the Twelve Niles!” 

“All right, then. Unless you 
open your mind to me. I’m a good 
telepath myself.” 

“Open my mind! Whatever 
for?” The incongruous indecency 
of it shocked Casher O’Neill. He’d 
had men and women and govern- 
ments ask a lot of strange things 
from him, but no one before had 
had the cold impudence to ask 
him to open his mind. “And why 
you?” he went on, “What would 



you get out of it? There’s nothing 
much in my mind.” 

“To make sure,” said the He- 
reditary Dictator, “that you are 
not too honest and sharp in your 
beliefs. If you’re positive that you 
know what to do, you might be 
another Colonel Wedder, putting 
y6ur people through a dozen tor- 
ments for a Utopia which never 
quite comes true. If you don’t 
care at all, you might be like your 
uncle. He did no real harm. He 
just stole his planet blind and he 
had some extraordinary habits 
which got him talked about be- 
tween the stars. He never killed 
a man in his life, did he?” 

“No, sir,” said Casher O’Neill, 
“he never did.” It relieved him to 
tell the one little good thing about 
his uncle; there was so very, very 
little which could be said in Ku- 
raf’s favor. 

“I don’t like slobbering old lib- 
ertines like your uncle,” said 
Philip Vincent, “but I don’t hate 
them either. They don’t hurt 
other people much. As a matter 
of actual fact, they don’t hurt 
anyone but themselves. They 
waste property, though. Like 
these horses you have on Mizzer. 
We’d never bring living beings to 
this world of Pontoppidan, just to 
play games with. And you know 
we’re not poor. We’re no Old 
North Australia, but we have a 
good income here.” 

That, thought Casher O’Neill, 



is the understatement of the year, 
but he was a careful young man 
with a great deal at stake, so he 
said nothing. 

The Dictator looked at him 
shrewdly. He appreciated the 
value of Casher’s tactful silence. 
Genevieve tugged at his sleeve, 
but he frowned her interruption 
away. 

i4TF,” said the Hereditary Dic- 
tator, “if,” he repeated, 
“you pass two tests, I will give 
you a green ruby as big as my 
head. If my Committee will allow 
me to do so. But I think I can 
talk them around. One test is that 
you let me peep all over your 
mind, to make sure that I am not 
dealing with one more honest 
fool. If you’re too honest, you’re 
a fool and a danger .to mankind. 
I’ll give you a dinner and ship 
you off-planet as fast as I can. 
And the other test is — solve the 
puzzle of this horse. The one 
horse on Pontoppidan. Why is 
the animal here? What should we 
do with it? If it’s good to eat, how 
should we cook it? Or can we 
trade to some other world, like 
your planet Mizzer, which seems 
to set a value on horses?” 

“Thank you, sir — ” said Cash- 
er O’Neill. 

“But, uncle — ” said Genevieve. 

“Keep quiet, my darling, and 
let the young man speak,” said 
the Dictator.

“ — all I was going to ask, is,” 
said Casher O’Neill, “what’s a 
green ruby good for? I didn’t 
even know they came green.” 

“That, young man, is a Pon- 
toppidan specialty. We have a 
geology based on ultra-heavy 
chemistry. This planet was once 
a fragment from a giant planet 
which imploded. The use is sim- 
ple. With a green ruby you can 
make a laser beam which will 
boil away your city of Kaheer in 
a single sweep. We don’t have 
weapons here and we don’t be- 
lieve in them, so I won’t give you 
a weapon. You’ll have to travel 
further to find a ship and to get 
the apparatus for mounting your 
green ruby. If I give it to you. 
But you will be one more step 
along in your fight with Colonel 
Wedder.” 

“Thank you, thank you, most 
honorable sir!” cried Casher O’- 
Neill. 

“But uncle,” said Genevieve, 
“you shouldn’t have picked those 
two things because I know the 
answers.” 

“You know all about him,” said 
the Hereditary Dictator, “by 
some means of your own?” 

Genevieve flushed under her 
lilac-hued foundation cream. “I 
know enough for us to know.” 

“How do you know it, my darl- 
ing?” 

“I just know,” said Genevieve. 

Her uncle made no comment. 



but he smiled widely and indul. 
gently as if he had heard that 
particular phrase before. 

She stamped her foot. “And I 
know about the horse, too. All 
about it.” 

“Have you seen it?” 

“No.” 

“Have you talked to it?” 
“Horses don’t talk, uncle.” 
“Most underpeople do,” he said. 
“This isn’t an underperson, 
uncle. It’s a plain unmodified old 
Earth animal. It never did talk.” 
“Then what do you know, my 
honey?” The uncle was affection- 
ate, but there was the crackle of 
impatience under his voice. 

“I taped it. The whole thing. 
The story of the horse of Pon- 
toppidan. And I’ve edited it, too. 
I was going to show it to you this 
morning, but your staff sent that 
young man in.” 

Casher O’Neill looked his apol- 
ogies at Genevieve. 

She did not notice him. Her 
eyes were on her uncle. 

“Since you’ve done this much, 
we might as well see it.” He 
turned to the attendants. “Bring 
chairs. And drinks. You know 
mine. The young lady will take 
tea with lemon. Real tea. Will 
you have coffee, young man?” 
“You have coffee!” cried Cash- 
er O’Neill. As soon as he said it, 
he felt like a fool. Pontoppidan 
was a rich planet. On most 
worlds’ exchanges, coffee came

to about two man-years per 
[jilo. Here halftracks crunched 
tjieir way through gems as they 
^ent to load up the frequent trad- 
ing vessels. 

The chairs were put in place. 
The drinks arrived. The Heredi- 
tary Dictator had been momen- 
tarily lost in a brown study, as 
though he were wondering about 
(jis promise to Casher O’Neill. He 
had even murmured to the young 
man, “Our bargain stands? Never 
mind what my niece says.” Cash- 
er had nodded vigorously. The 
old man had gone back to frown- 
ing at the servants and did not 
relax until a tiger-man bounded 
into the room, carrying a tray 
with acrobatic precision. The 
chairs were already in place. 

The father held his niece’s 
chair for her as a command that 
she sit down. He nodded Casher 
O’Neill into a chair on the other 
side of himself. 

He commanded, “Dim the 
lights . .” 

The room plunged into semi- 
darkness. 

Without being told, the people 
took their places immediately be- 
hind the three main seats and the 
underpeople perched or sat on 
benches and tables behind them. 
Very little was spoken. Casher 
O’Neill could sense that Pontop- 
pidan was a well-run place. He 
began to wonder if the Heredi- 
tary Dictator had much real work 

ON THE GEM PLANET 



left to do, if he could fuss that 
much over a single horse. Per- 
haps all he did was boss his niece 
and watch the robots load truck- 
loads of gems into sacks while the 
underpeople weighed them, listed 
them and wrote out the bills for 
the customers. 

II 

^HERE was no screen; this 
was a good machine. 

The planet Pontoppidan came 
into view, its airless brightness 
giving strong hints of the mineral 
riches which might be found. 

Here and there enormous 
domes, such as the one in which 
this palace was located, came in- 
to view. 

Genvieve’s own voice, girlish, 
impulsive and yet didactic, rang 
out with the story of her planet. 
It was as though she had pre- 
pared the picture not only for 
her own father, but for off-world 
visitors as well. (By Joan, that’s 
it! thought Casher O’Neill. If they 
don’t raise much food here, out- 
side of the hydroponics, and don’t 
have any real People Places, they 
have to trade: that does mean 
visitors, and many, many of 
them.) 

The story was interesting but 
the girl herself was more inter- 
esting. Her face shone in the 
shifting light which the images — 
a meter, perhaps a little more, 

‘ 99 






from the floor — reflected across 
the room. Casher O’Neill thought 
that he had never before seen a 
woman who so peculiarly com- 
bined intelligence and charm. 
She was girl, girl, girl, all the way 
through; but she was also very 
smart and pleased with being 
smart. It betokened a happy life. 
He found himself glancing covert- 
ly at her. Once he caught her 
glancing, equally covertly, at him. 
The darkness of the scene en- 
abled them both to pass it off as 
an accident without embarrass- 
ment. 

Her viewtape had come to the 
story of the dipsies, enormous 
canyons which lay like deep 
gashes on the surface of the 
planet. Some of the color views 
were spectacular beyond belief. 
Casher O’Neill, as the “appointed 
one” of Mizzer, had had plenty of 
time to wander through the non- 
salacious parts of his uncle’s col- 
lections, and he had seen pictures 
of the most notable worlds. 

Never had he seen anything 
like this. One view showed a sun- 
set against a six-kilometer cliff of 
a material which looked like solid 
emerald. The peculiar bright sun- 
shine of Pontoppidan’s small, 
penetrating, lilac-hued sun ran 
like living water over the preci- 
pice of gems. Even the reduced 
image, one meter by one meter, 
was enough to make him catch 
his breath. 



The bottom of the dipsy had! 
vapor emerging in curious cylin- 
drical columns which seemed to 
erode as they reached two or 
three times the height of a man. 
The recorded voice of Genevieve 
was explaining that the very thin 
atmosphere of Pontoppidan 
would not be breathable for an- 
other 2,520 years, since the set- 
tlers did not wish to squander 
their resources on a luxury like 
breathing when the whole planet 
only had 60,000 inhabitants; they 
would rather go on with masks 
and use their wealth in other 
ways. After all, it was not as 
though they did not have their 
domed cities, some of them many 
kilometers in radius. Besides the 
usual hydroponics, they had even 
imported 7.2 hectares of garden 
soil, 5.5 centimeters deep, togeth- 
er with enough water to make the 
gardens rich and fruitful. They 
had bought worms, too, at the 
price of eight carats of diamond 
per living worm, in order to keep 
the soil of the gardens loose and 
living. 

Genevieve’s transcribed voice 
rang out with pride as she listed 
these accomplishments of her 
people, but a note of sadness 
came in when she returned to 
the subject of the dipsies. “ . 
and though we would like to live 
in them and develop their at- 
mospheres, we dare not. There is 
too much escap)e of radioactivity. 



The geysers themselves may or 
ffiay not be contaminated from 
one hour to the next. So we just 
look at them. Not one of them 
has ever been settled, except for 
the Hippy Dipsy, where the horse 
came from. Watch this next pic- 
ture. 

The camera sheered up, up, up 
from the surface of the planet. 
VVhere it had wandered among 
mountains of diamonds and val- 
leys of tourmalines, it now took 
to the blue-black of near, inner 
space. One of the canyons showed 
(from high altitude) the grotes- 
que pattern of a human woman’s 
hips and legs, though what might 
have been the upper body was 
lost in a confusion of broken hills 
which ended in a bright almost- 
iridescent plain to the North. 

“That,” said the real Gene- 
vieve, overriding her own voice 
on the screen, “is the Hippy Dip- 
sy. There, see the blue? That’s 
the only lake on all of Pontoppi- 
dan. And here we drop to the 
hermit’s house.” 

pASHER O’Neill almost felt 
^ vertigo as the camera plum- 
meted from off-planet into the 
depths of that immense canyon. 
The edges of the canyon almost 
seemed to move like lips with the 
plunge, opening and folding in- 
ward to swallow him up. 

Suddenly they were beside a 
beautiful little lake. 



A small hut stood beside the 
shore. 

In the doorway there sat a 
man, dead. 

His body had been there a long 
time; it was already mummified. 

Genevieve’s recorded voice ex- 
plained the matter: “. in Nor- 
strilian law and custom, they told 
him that his time had come. They 
told him to go to the Dying 
House, since he was no longer fit 
to live. In Old North Australia, 
they are so rich that they let 
everyone live as long as he wants, 
unless the old person can’t take 
rejuvenation any more, even with 
stroon, and unless he or she gets 
to be a real pest to the living. 
If that happens, they are invited 
to go to the Dying House, where 
they shriek and pant with deliri- 
ous joy for weeks or days until 
they finally die of an overload of 
sheer happiness and excitement 
. .” There was a hesitation, even 
in the recording. “We never knew 
why this man refused. He stood 
off-planet and said that he had 
seen views of the Hippy Dipsy. 
He said it was the most beautiful 
place on all the worlds, and that 
he wanted to build a cabin there, 
to live alone, except for his non- 
human friend. We thought it was 
some small pet. When we told 
him that the Hippy Dipsy was 
very dangerous, he said that this 
did not matter in the least to him, 
since he was old and dying any-

how. Then he offered to pay us 
twelve times our planetary in- 
come if we would lease him 
twelve hectares on the condition 
of absolute privacy. No pictures, 
no scanners, no help, no visitors. 
Just solitude and scenery. His 
name was Perino. My great- 
grandfather asked for nothing 
more, except the written transfer 
of credit. When he paid it, Peri- 
no even asked that he be left 
alone after he was dead. Not even 
a vault rocket so that he could 
either orbit Pontoppidan forever 
or start a very slow journey to no- 
where, the way so many people 
like it. So this is our first picture 
of him. We took it when the light 
went off in the People Room and 
one of the tiger-men told us that 
he was sure a human conscious- 
ness had come to an end in the 
Hippy Dipsy. 

“And we never even thought 
of the pet. After all, we had never 
made a picture of him. This is 
the way he arrived from Perino’s 
shack.” 

A ROBOT was shown in a con- 
trol room, calling excitedly 
in the old Common Tongue. 

“People, people! Judgment 
needed! Moving object coming 
out of the Hippy Dipsy. Object 
has improper shape. Not a cor- 
rect object. Should not rise. Does 
so anyhow. People, tell me, F>eo- 
ple, tell me! Destroy or not des- 



troy? This is an improper object. 
It should fall, not rise. Coming 
out of the Hippy Dipsy.” 

A firm click shut off the robot’s 
chatter. A well-shaped woman 
took over. From the nature of 
her work and the lithe, smooth 
tread with which she walked, 
Casher O’Neill suspected that 
she was of cat origin, but there 
was nothing in her dress or in her 
manner to show that she was un- 
derpeople. 

The woman in the picture . 
lighted a screen. 

She moved her hands in the 
air in front of her, like a blind 
person feeling his way through 
op>en day. 

The picture on the inner screen 
came to resolution. 

A face showed in it. 

What a face! thought Casher 
O’Neill, and he heard the other 
people around him in the viewing 
room. 

The horse! 

Imagine a face like that of a 
newborn cat, thought Casher. 
Mizzer is full of cats. But imagine 
the face with a huge mouth, with 
big yellow teeth — a nose long 
beyond imagination. Imagine 
eyes which look friendly. In the 
picture they were rolling back 
and forth with exertion, but even 
there — when they did not feel 
observed — there was nothing 
hostile about the set of the eyes. 
They were tame, companionable 



eyes. Two ridiculous ears stood 
high, and a little tuft of golden 
hair showed on the crest of the 
head between the ears. 

The viewed scene was comical, 
too. The cat-woman was as 
astonished as the viewers. It was 
lucky that she had touched the 
emergency switch, so that she not 
only saw the horse, but had re- 
corded herself and her own 
actions while bringing him into 
view. 

Genevieve whisp>ered across 
the chest of the Hereditary Dic- 
tator: “Later we found he was a 
palomino pony. That’s a very 
special kind of horse. And Perino 
had made him immortal, or al- 
most immortal.” 

“Sh-h!” said her uncle. 

The screen-within-the-screen 
showed the cat-woman waving 
her hands in the air some more. 
The view broadened. 

The horse had four hands and 
no legs, or four legs and no hands, 
whichever way you want to count 
them. 

The horse was fighting his way 
up a narrow cleft of rubies which 
led out of the Hippy Dipsy. He 
panted heavily. The oxygen bot- 
tles on his sides swung wildly as 
he clambered. He must have seen 
something, perhaps the image of 
the cat-woman, because he said a 
word: 

W hay-yay-yay-yay-whay-yay! 

The cat-woman in the nearer 



picture spoke very distinctly : 

“Give your name, age, species 
and authority for being on this 
planet.” She spoke clearly and 
with the utmost possible author- 
ity. 

The horse obviously heard her. 
His ears tipped forward. But his 
reply was the same as before: 

W hay-yay-yay! 

Casher O’Neill realized that he 
had followed the mood of the pic- 
ture and had seen the horse the 
way that the people on Pontop- 
pidan woud have seen him. On 
second thought, the horse was 
nothing special, by the standards 
of the Twelve Niles or the Little 
Horse Market^ in the city of 
Kaheer. It was an old pony stal- 
lion, no longer fit for breeding and 
probably not for riding either. 
The hair had whitened among the 
gold; the teeth were worn. The 
animal showed many injuries 
and burns. Its only use was to be 
killed, cut up and fed to the 
racing dogs. But he said nothing 
to the people around him. They 
were still spellbound by the pic- 
ture. 

The cat-woman repeated: 

“Your name isn’t Whayayay. 
Identify yourself properly; name 
first.” 

The horse answered her with 
the same word in a higher key. 

Apparently forgetting that she 
had recorded herself as well as 
the emergency screen, the cat- 



102 



GALAXY 



ON THE GEM PLANET 



103 



woman said, “I’ll call real people 
if you don’t answer! They’ll be 
annoyed at being bothered.” 

The horse rolled his eyes at her 
and said nothing. 

The cat-woman pressed an 
emergency button on the side of 
the room. One could not see the 
other communication screen 
which lighted up, but her end of 
the conversation was plain. 

“I want an ornithopter. Big one. 
Emergency.” 

A mumble from the side screen. 

“To go to the Hippy Dipsy. 
There’s an underperson there, 
and he’s in so much trouble that 
he won’t talk.” From the screen 
beside her, the horse seemed to 
have understood the sense of the 
message, if not the words, be- 
cause he repeated: 

W hay-yay-whay-yay-yay! 

“See,” said the cat-woman to 
the person in the other screen, 
“that’s what he’s doing. It’s obvi- 
ously an emergency.” 

The voice from the other 
screen came through, tinny and 
remote by double recording: 

“Fool, yourself, cat-woman! No- 
body can fly an ornithopter into 
a dipsy. Tell your silly friend to 
go back to the floor of the dipsy 
and we’ll pick him up by space 
rocket.” 

Whay-yay-yay! said the horse 
impatiently. 

“He’s not my friend, " said the 
cat-woman with brisk annoyance. 



“I just discovered him a couple of 
minutes ago. He’s asking for help. 
Any idiot can see that, even if we 
don’t know his language.” 

The picture snapped off. 

^ I ■'HE next scene showed tiny 
human figures working with 
searchlights at the top of an ini- 
measurably high cliff. Here and 
there, the beam of the searchlight 
caught the cliff face; the trans- 
lucent faceted material of the cliff 
looked almost like rows of eerie 
windows, their lights snapping on 
and off, as the searchlight moved. 

Far down there was a red glow. 
Fire came from inside the moun- 
tain. 

Even with telescopic lenses the 
cameraman could not get the 
close-up of the glow. On one side 
there was the figure of the hors^; 
his four arms stretched at impos- 
sible angles as he held himself 
firm in the crevasse; on the other 
side of the fire there were the 
even tinier figures of men, labor- 
ing to fit some sort of sling to 
reach the horse. 

For some odd reason having to 
do with the techniques of record- 
ing, the voices came through very 
plainly, even the heavy, tired 
breathing of the old horse. Now 
and then he uttered one of the 
special horse-words which seemed 
to be the limit of his vocabulary. 
He was obviously watching the 
men, and was firmly persuaded of 



104 



GALAXY 





their friendliness to him. His 
large, tame, yellow eyes rolled 
wildly in the light of the search- 
light and every time the horse 
looked down, he seemed to shud- 
der. 

Casher O’Neill found this en- 
tirely understandable. The bot- 
tom of the Hippy Dipsy was no- 
where in sight; the horse, even 
with nothing more than the en- 
larged fingernails of his middle 
fingers to help him climb, had 
managed to get about four of the 
six kilometers’ height of the cliff 
face behind him. 

The voice of a tiger-man 
sounded clearly from among the 
shift of men, underpeople and ro- 
bots who were struggling on the 
face of the cliff. 

“It’s a gamble, but not much 
of a gamble. I weigh six hundred 
kilos myself, and, do you know, I 
don’t think I’ve ever had to use 
my full strength since I was a 
kitten. I know that I can jump 
across the fire and help that thing 
be more comfortable. I can even 
tie a rope around him so that he 
won’t slip and fall after all the 
work we’ve done. And the work 
he’s done, too,” added the tiger- 
man grimly. “Perhaps I can just 
take him in my arms and jump 
back with him. It will be perfectly 
safe if you have a safety rope 
around each of us. After all, I 
never saw a less prehensile crea- 
ture in my life. You can’t call 



those fingers of his ‘fingers.’ They 
look like little boxes of bone, de. 
signed for running around and 
not much good for anything else.” 

There was a murmur of other 
voices and then the command of 
the supervisor. “Go ahead.” 

No one was prepared for what 
happened next. 

The cameraman got the tiger- 
man right in the middle of his 
frame, showing the attachment of 
one rope around the tiger-man’s 
broad waist. The tiger-man was 
a modified type whom the au- 
thorities had not bothered to put 
into human cosmetic form. He 
still had his ears on top of his 
head, yellow and black fur over 
his face, huge incisors overlapping 
his lower jaw and enormous an- 
tenna-like whiskers sticking out 
from his moustache. He must 
have been thoroughly modified 
inside, however, because his tem- 
perament was calm, friendly and 
even a little humorous; he must 
have had a carefully re-done 
mouth, because the utterance of 
human speech came to him clear- 
ly and without distortion. 

He jumped — a mighty jump, 
right through the top edges of the 
flame. 

The horse saw him. 

The horse jumpjed too, almost 
in the same moment, also through 
the top of the flame, going the 
other way. 

The horse had feared the tiger- 



106 



GALAXY 



man more than he did the cliff. 

The horse landed right in the 
group of workers. He tried not to 
hurt them with his flailing limbs, 
but he did knock one man — a 
true man, at that — off the cliff. 
The man’s scream faded as he 
crashed into the impenetrable 
darkness below. 

The robots were quick. Having 
no emotions except on, off, and 
hi^h, they did not get excited. 
They had the horse trussed and, 
before the true men and under- 
people had ensured their footing, 
they had signaled the crane oper- 
ator at the top of the cliff. The 
horse, his four arms swinging 
limply, disappeared upward. 

The tiger-man jumped back 
through the flames to the nearer 
ledge. The picture went off. 

In the viewing room, the He- 
reditary Dictator Philip Vincent 
stood up. He stretched, looking 
around. 

Genevieve looked at Casher 
O’Neill expectantly. 

“That’s the story,” said the Dic- 
tator mildly. “Now you solve it.” 

“Where is the horse now?” said 
Casher O’Neill. 

“In the hospital, of course. My 
niece can take you to see him.” 

Ill 

A FTER A short, painful and 
very thorough peeping of his 
own mind by the Hereditary Dic- 



tator, Casher O’Neill and Gene- 
vieve set off for the hospital in 
which the horse was being kept in 
bed. The people of Pontoppidan 
had not known what else to do 
with him, so they had placed 
him under strong sedation and 
were trying to feed him with 
sugar-water compounds going di- 
rectly into his veins. Genevieve 
told Casher that the horse was 
wasting away. 

They walked to the hospital 
over amethyst pebbles. 

Instead of wearing his space- 
suit, Casher wore a surface hel- 
met which enriched his oxygen. 
His hosts had not counted on his 
getting spells of uncontrollable 
itching from the sharply reduced 
atmospheric pressure. He did not 
dare mention the matter, because 
he was still hoping to get the 
green ruby as a weapon in his 
private war for the liberation of 
the Twelve Niles from the rule 
of Colonel Wedder. Whenever the 
itching became less than excruci- 
ating, he enjoyed the walk and 
the company of the slight, beauti- 
ful girl who accompanied him 
across the fields of jewels to the 
hospital. (In later years, he some- 
times wondered what might have 
happened. Was the itching a part 
of his destiny, which saved him 
for the freedom of the city of 
Kaheer and the planet Mizzer? 
Might not the innocent brilliant 
loveliness of the girl have other- 



ON THE GEM PLANET 



107 



wise tempted him to forswear his 
duty and stay forever on Pontop- 
pidan? ) 

The girl wore a new kind of 
cosmetic for outdoor walking — 
a warm peachhued powder which 
let the natural pink of her cheeks 
show through. Her eyes, he saw, 
were a living, deep gray; her eye- 
lashes, long; her smile, innocently 
provocative beyond all ordinary 
belief. It was a wonder that the 
Hereditary Dictator had not had 
to stop duels and murders be- 
tween young men vying for her 
favor. 

They finally reached the hospi- 
tal, just as Casher O’Neill thought 
he could stand it no longer and 
would have to ask Genevieve for 
some kind of help or carriage to 
get indoors and away from the 
frightful itching. 

The building was underground. 

The entrance was sumptuous. 
Diamonds and rubies, the size of 
building-bricks on Mizzer, had 
been set to frame the doorway, 
which was apparently enameled 
steel. Kuraf at his most lavish had 
never wasted money on anything 
like this door-frame. Genevieve 
saw his glance. 

“It did cost a lot of credits. We 
had to bring a blind artist all the 
way from Olympia to paint that 
enamel-work. The poor man. He 
spent most of his time trying to 
steal extra gem-stones when he 
should have known that we pay 



justly and never allow anyone to 
get away with stealing.” 

“What do you do?” asked 
Casher O’Neill. 

“We cut thieves up in space, 
just at the edge of the atmo- 
sphere. We have more manned 
boats in orbit than any other 
planet I know of. Maybe Old 
North Australia has more, but, 
then, nobody ever gets close 
enough to Old North Australia to 
come back alive and tell.” 

They went on into the hospital. 

A RESPECTFUL chief surgeon 
insisted on keeping them in 
the office and entertaining them 
with tea and confectionery, when 
they both wanted to go see the 
horse; common politeness pro- 
hibited their pushing through. 
Finally they got past the cere- 
mony and into the room in which 
the horse was kept. 

Close up, they could see how 
much he had suffered. There were 
cuts and abrasures over almost 
all of his body. One of his hooves 
— the doctor told them that was 
the correct name, hoof, for the 
big middle fingernail on which he 
walked — was split; the doctor 
had put a cadmium-silver bar 
through it. The horse lifted his 
head when they entered, but he 
saw that they were just more 
people, not horsey people, so he 
put his head down, very patiently. 
“What’s the prospect, doctor?” 



108 



GALAXY 



asked Casher O’Neill, turning 
away from the animal. 

“Could I ask you, sir, a foolish 
question first?” 

Surprised, Casher could only 
say yes. 

“You’re an O’Neill. Your uncle 
is Kuraf. How do you happen to 
be called ‘Casher’?” 

“That’s simple,” laughed Cash- 
er. “This is my young-man-name. 
On Mizzer, everybody gets a 
baby name, which nobody uses. 
Then he gets a nickname. Then 
he gets a young-man-name, based 
on some characteristic or some 
friendly joke, until he picks out 
his career. When he enters his 
profession, he picks out his own 
career name. If I liberate Mizzer 
and overthrow Colonel Wedder, 
I’ll have to think up a suitable 
career name for myself.” 

“But why ‘Casher,’ sir?” per- 
sisted the doctor. 

“When I was a little boy and 
people asked me what I wanted, 
I always asked for cash. I guess 
that contrasted with my uncle’s 
wastefulness, so they called me 
Casher.” 

“But what is cash? One of your 
crops?” 

It was Casher’s time to look 
amazed. “Cash is money. Paper 
credits. People pass them back 
and forth when they buy things.” 

“Here on Pontoppidan, all the 
money belongs to me. All of it,” 
said Genevieve. “My uncle is 



trustee for me. But I have never 
been allowed to touch it or to 
spend it. It’s all just planet busi- 
ness.” 

The doctor blinked respectful- 
ly. “Now this horse, sir, if you 
will pardon my asking about your 
name, is a very strange case. 
Physiologically he is a pure earth 
type. He is suited only for a vege- 
table diet, but otherwise he is a 
very close relative of man. He 
has a single stomach and a 
very large cone-shaped heart. 
That’s where the trouble is. The 
heart is in bad condition. He is 
dying.” 

“Dying?” cried Genevieve. 

“That’s the sad, horrible part,” 
said the doctor. “He is dying but 
he cannot die. He could go on 
like this for many years. Perino 
wasted enough stroon on this ani- 
mal to make a planet immortal. 
Now the animal is worn out but 
cannot die.” 

Casher O’Neill let out a long, 
low, ululating whistle. Everybody 
in the room jumped. He disre- 
garded them. It was the whistle 
he had used near the stables, back 
among the Twelve Niles, when he 
wanted to call a horse. 

The horse knew it. The large 
head lifted. The eyes rolled at 
him so imploringly that he ex- 
pected tears to fall from them, 
even though he was pretty sure 
that horses could not lachrymate. 

He squatted on the floor, close 



ON THE GEM PLANET 



109 



to the horse’s head, with a hand 
on its mane. 

“Quick,” he murmured to the 
surgeon. “Gret me a piece of sugar 
and an underperson-telepath. The 
underperson-telepath must not be 
of carnivorous origin.” 

^1 ■'HE doctor looked stupid. He 
snapped “Sugar” at an as- 
sistant but he squatted down next 
to Casher O’Neill and said, “You 
will have to repeat that about an 
underp>erson. This is not an un- 
derperson hospital at all. We 
have very few of them here. The 
horse is here only by command 
of His Excellency Philip 'Vincent, 
who said that the horse of Perino 
should be given the best of all 
possible care. He even told me,” 
said the doctor, “that if anything 
wrong happened to this horse, I 
would ride patrol for it for the 
next eighty years. So I’ll do what 
I can. Do you find me too talka- 
tive? Some people do. What kind 
of an underperson do you want?” 

“I need,” said Casher, very 
calmly, “a telepathic underperson, 
both to find out what this horse 
wants and to tell the horse that I 
am here to help him. Horses are 
vegetarians and they do not like 
meat-eaters. Do you have a vege- 
tarian underperson around the 
hospital?” 

“We used to have some squir- 
rel-men,” said the chief surgeon, 
“but when we changed the air 



circulating system the squirrel, 
men went away with the old 
equipment. I think they went to 
a mine. We have tiger-men, cat- 
men, and my secretary is a wolf.” 

“Oh, no!” said Casher O’Neill. 
“Can you imagine a sick horse 
confiding in a wolf?” 

“It’s no more than you are do- 
ing,” said the surgeon, very softly, 
glancing up to see if Genevieve 
were in hearing range, and ap- 
parently judging that she was not. 
“The Hereditary Dictators here 
sometimes cut suspicious guests 
to pieces on their way off the 
planet. That is, unless the guests 
are licensed, regular traders. You 
are not. You might be a spy, 
planning to rob us. How do I 
know? I wouldn’t give a diamond 
chip for your chances of being 
alive next week. What do you 
want to do about the horse? That 
might please the Dictator. And 
you might live.” 

Casher O’Neill was so stag- 
gered by the confidence of the 
surgeon that he squatted there 
thinking about himself, not about 
the patient. The horse licked him, 
seemingly sensing that he needed 
solace. 

The surgeon had an idea. 
“Horses and dogs used to go to- 
gether, didn’t they, back in the 
old days of Manhome, when all 
the people lived on planet 
Earth?” 

“Of course,” said Casher. “We 



no 



GALAXY 



still run them together in hunts 
on Mizzer, but under these new 
laws of the Instrumentality we’ve 
run out of underpieople-criminals 
to hunt.” 

“I have a good dog,” said the 
chief surgeon. “She talks pretty 
well, but she is so sympathetic 
that she upsets the patients by 
loving them too much. I have her 
down in the second underbase- 
ment tending the dish-sterilizing 
machinery.” 

“Bring her up,” said Casher in 
a whisper. 

He remembered that he did 
not need to whisper about this, so 
he stood up and spoke to Gene- 
vieve : 

“They have found a good dog- 
telepath who may reach through 
to the mind of the horse. It may 
give us the answer.” 

She put her hand on his fore- 
arm gently, with the approbatory 
gesture of a princess. Her fingers 
dug into his flesh. Was she wish- 
ing him well against her uncle’s 
habitual treachery, or was this 
merely the impulse of a kind 
young girl who knew nothing of 
the way the world was run? 

IV 

T he interview went extremely 
well. 

The dog-woman was almost 
perfectly humaniform. She looked 
like a tired, cheerful, worn-out 



old woman, not valuable enough 
to be given the life-prolonging 
santaclara drug called stroon. 
Work had been her life and she 
had had plenty of it. Casher 
'O’Neill felt a twinge of envy 
when he realized that happiness 
goes by the petty chances of life 
and not by the large destiny. This 
dog-woman, with her haggard 
face and her stringy gray hair, 
had more love, happiness and 
sympathy than Kuraf had found 
with his pleasures. Colonel Wed- 
der with his powers, or himself 
with his crusade. Why did life do 
that? Was there no justice, ever? 
Why should a worn-out worthless 
old underwoman be happy when 
he was not? 

“Never mind,” she said, “you’ll 
get over it and then you will be 
happy.” 

“Over what?” he said. “I didn’t 
say anything.” 

“I’m not going to say it,” she 
retorted, meaning that she was 
telepathic. “You’re a prisoner of 
yourself. Some day you will es- 
cape to unimportance and happi- 
ness. You’re a good man. You’re 
trying to save yourself, but you 
really like this horse.” 

“Of course I do,” said Casher 
O’Neill. “He’s a brave old horse, 
climbing out of that hell to get 
back to people.” 

When he said the word hell her 
eyes widened, but she said noth- 
ing. In his mind, he saw the sign 



ON THE GEM PLANET 



111 



of a fish scrawled on a dark wall 
and he felt her think at him, So 
you too know something of the 
“dark wonderful knowledge” 
which is not yet to be revealed to 
all mankind? 

He thought a cross back at her 
and then turned his thinking to 
the horse, lest their telepathy be 
monitored and strange punish- 
ments await them both. 

She spoke in words, “Shall we 
link?” 

“Link,” he said. 

Genevieve stepped up. Her 
clear-cut, pretty, sensitive face 
was alight with excitement. 
“Could I — could I be cut in?” 

“Why not?” said the dog- 
woman, glancing at him. He nod- 
ded. The three of them linked 
hands and then the dog-woman 
put her left hand on the forehead 
of the old horse. 

^T^HE sand splashed beneath 
their feet as they ran toward 
Kaheer. The delicious pressure of 
a man’s body was on their backs. 
The red sky of Mizzer gleamed 
over them. There came the shout: 

“I’m a horse, I’m a horse, I’m 
a horse!” 

“You’re from Mizzer,” thought 
Casher O’Neill, “from Kaheer it- 
self!” 

“I don’t know names,” thought 
the horse, “but you’re from my 
land. The land, the good land.” 

“What are you doing here?” 



“Dying,” thought the horse. 
“Dying for hundreds and thou- 
sands of sundowns. The old one 
brought me. No riding, no run- 
ning, no people. Just the old one 
and the small ground. I have been 
dying since I came here.” 

Casher O’Neill got a glimpse 
of Perino sitting and watching the 
horse, unconscious of the cruelty 
and loneliness which he had in- 
flicted on his large pet by making 
it immortal and then giving it no 
work to do. 

“Do you know what dying is?” 
Thought the horse promptly: 
“Certainly. No-horse.” 

“Do you know what life is?” 
“Yes. Being a horse.” 

“I’m not a horse,” thought 
Casher O’Neill, “but I am alive.” 
“Don’t complicate things,” 
thought the horse at him, though 
Casher realized it was his own 
mind and not the horse’s which 
supplied the words. 

“Do you want to die?” 

“To no-horse? Yes, if this room, 
forever, is the end of things.” 
“What would you like better?” 
thought - Genevieve, and her 
thoughts were like a cascade of 
newly-minted silver coins falling 
into all their minds: brilliant, 
clean, bright, innocent. 

The answer was quick: “Dirt 
beneath my hooves, and wet air 
again, and a man on my back.” 
The dog-woman interrupted: 
“Dear horse, you know me?” 



112 



GALAXY 



“You’re a dog,” thought the 
horse. “Goo-oo-oo-ood dog!” 

“Right,” thought the happy old 
slattern, “and I can tell these 
people how to take care of you. 
Sleep now, and when you waken 
you will be on the way to happi- 
ness.” 

She thought the command 
sleep so powerfully at the old 
horse that Casher O’Neill and 
Genevieve both started to fall un- 
conscious and had to be caught 
by the hospital attendants. 

As they re-gathered their wits, 
she was finishing her commands 
to the surgeon. “ — and put about 
40% supplementary oxygen into 
the air. He’ll have to have a real 
person to ride him, but some of 
your orbiting sentries would rath- 
er ride a horse up there than do 
nothing. You can’t repair the 
heart. Don’t try it. Hypnosis will 
take care of the sand of Mizzer. 
Just load his mind with one or 
two of the drama-cubes packed 
full of desert adventure. Now, 
don’t you worry about me. I’m 
not going to claim any credit, and 
I’m not going to give you any 
more suggestions. People-man, 
you!” she laughed. “You can for- 
give us dogs anything, except for 
being right. It makes you feel in- 
ferior for a few minutes. Never 
mind. I’m going back downstairs 
to my dishes. I love them, I real- 
ly do. Good-by, you pretty thing,” 
she said to Genevieve. “And good- 



bye, wanderer! Good luck to you,” 
she said to Casher O’Neill. “You 
will remain miserable as long as 
you seek justice, but when you 
give up, righteousness will come 
to you and you will be happy. 
Don’t worry. You’re young and 
it won’t hurt you to suffer a few 
more years. Youth is an extreme- 
ly curable disease, isn’t it?” 

She gave them a full curtsey, 
like one Lady of the Instrumen- 
tality saying good-by to another. 
Her wrinkled old face was lit up 
with smiles, in which happiness 
was mixed with a tiniest bit of 
playful mockery. 

“Don’t mind me, boss,” she 
said to the surgeon. “Dishes, here 
I come.” She swept out of the 
room. 

“See what I mean?” said the 
surgeon. “She’s so horribly happy! 
How can anyone run a hospital 
if a dishwasher gets all over the 
place, making people happy? 
We’d be out of jobs. Her ideas 
were good, though.” 

They were. They worked. 
Down to the last letter of the 
dog-woman’s instructions. 

^ I ''HERE was argument from 
the council. Casher O’Neill 
went along to see them in session. 

One councillor, Bashnack, was 
particularly vociferous in object- 
ing to any action concerning the 
horse. “Sire,” he cried, “sire! We 
don’t even know the name of the

113 



animal! I must protest this action, 
when we don’t know — ” 

“That we don’t,’’ assented 
Philip Vincent. “But what does a 
name have to do with it?” 

“The horse has no identity, not 
even the identity of an animal. 
It is just a pile of meat left over 
from the estate of Perino. We 
should kill the horse and eat the 
meat ourselves. Or, if we do not 
want to eat the meat, then we 
should sell it off-planet. There 
are plenty of peoples around here 
who would pay a pretty price for 
genuine earth meat. Pay no at- 
tention to me, sire! You are the 
Hereditary Dictator and I am 
nothing. I have no power, no 
property, nothing. I am at your 
mercy. All I can tell you is to 
follow your own best interests. I 
have only a voice. You cannot 
reproach me for using my voice 
when I am trying to help you, 
sire, can you? That’s all I am 
doing, helping you. If you spend 
any credits at all on this animal 
you will be doing wrong, wrong, 
wrong. We are not a rich planet. 
We have to pay for expensive de- 
fenses just in order to stay alive. 
We cannot even afford to pay 
for air that our children can go 
out and play. And you want to 
spend money on a horse which 
cannot even talk! I tell you, sire, 
this council is going to vote 
against you, just to protect your 
own interests and the interests of 



the Honorable Genevieve as 
Eventual Title-holder of all Pon- 
toppidan. You are not going to 
get away with this, sire! We are 
helpless before your power, but 
we will insist on advising you ^ — ” 

“Hear! Hear!” cried several of 
the councillors, not the least dis- 
mayed by the slight frown of the 
Hereditary Dictator. 

“I will take the word,” said 
Philip Vincent himself. 

Several had had their hands 
raised, asking for the floor. One 
obstinate man kept his hand up 
even when the Dictator an- 
nounced his intention to speak. 
Philip Vincent took note of him, 
too: 

“You can talk when I am 
through, if you want to.” 

He looked calmly around the 
room, smiled imperceptibly at his 
niece, gave Casher O’Neill the 
briefest of nods, and then an- 
nounced: 

“Gentlemen, it’s not the horse 
which is on trial. It’s Pontoppi- 
dan. It’s we who are trying our- 
selves. And before whom are we 
trying ourselves, gentlemen? 
Each of us is before that most 
awful of courts, his own con- 
science. 

4i¥F WE kill that horse, gentle- 
men, we will not be doing 
the horse a great wrong. He is an 
old animal, and I do not think 
that he will mind dying very

r 



much, now that he is away from 
the ordeal of loneliness which he 
feared more than death. After all, 
he has already had his great tri- 
umph — the climb up the cliff 
of gems, the jump across the vol- 
canic vent, the rescue by people 
whom he wanted to find. The 
horse has done so well that he 
is really beyond us. We can help 
him, a little, or we we can hurt 
him, a little; beside the immen- 
sity of his accomplishment, we 
cannot really do very much either 
way. 

“No, gentlemen, we are not 
judging the case of the horse. We 
are judging space. What happens 
to man when he moves out into 
the Big Nothing? Do we leave 
Old Earth behind? Why did civil- 
ization fall? Will it fall again? Is 
civilization a gun or a blaster or 
a laser or a rocket? Is it even a 
pianoforming ship or a pinlighter 
at his work? You know as well as 
I do, gentlemen, that civilization 
is not what we can do. If it had 
been, there would have been no 
fall of Ancient Man. Even in the 
Dark Ages they had a few fusion 
bombs, they could make some 
small guided missiles and they 
even had weapons like the Kas- 
kaskia Effect, which we have 
never been able to rediscover. 
The Dark Ages weren’t dark be- 
cause people lost techniques or 
science. They were dark because 
people lost people. It’s a lot of 



work to be human and it’s work 
which must be kept up, or it be- 
gins to fade. Gentlemen, the horse 
judges us. 

“Take the word, gentlemen. 
‘Civilization’ is itself a lady’s 
word. There were female writers 
in a country called France who 
made that word popular in the 
third century before space travel. 
To be ‘civilized’ meant for people 
to be tame, to be kind, to be 
polished. If we kill this horse, we 
are wild. If we treat the horse 
gently, we are tame. Gentlemen, 
I have only one witness and that 
witness will utter only one word. 
Then you shall vote and vote 
freely.” 

There was 9 murmur around 
the table at this announcement. 
Philip Vincent obviously enjoyed 
the excitement he had created. 
He let them murmur on for a 
full minute or two before he 
slapped the table gently and 
said, “Gentlemen, the witness. 
Are you ready?” 

There was a murmur of as- 
sent. Bashnack tried to say, “It’s 
still a question of public funds!” 
but his neighbors shushed him. 
The table became quiet. All faces 
turned toward the Hereditary 
Dictator. 

“Gentlemen, the testimony. 
Genevieve, is this what you your- 
self told me to say? Is civilization 
always a woman’s choice first, and 
only later a man’s?”

“Yes,” said Genevieve, with a 
happy, open smile. 

The meeting broke up amid 
laughter and applause. 

V 

L month later Casher O’Neill 
sat in a room in a medium- 
size pianoforming liner. They 
were out of reach of Pontoppidan. 
The Hereditary Dictator had not 
changed his mind and cut him 
down with green beams. Casher 
had strange memories, not bad 
ones for a young man. 

He remembered Genevieve 
weeping in the garden. 

“I’m romantic,” she cried, and 
wiped her eyes on the sleeve of 
his cape. “Legally I’m the owner 
of this planet, rich, powerful, free. 
But I can’t leave here. I’m too 
important. I can’t marry whom I 
want to marry. I’m too important. 
My uncle can’t do what he wants 
to do — he’s Hereditary Dictator 
and he always must do what the 
Council decides after weeks of 
chatter. I can’t love you. You’re 
a prince and a wanderer, with 
travels and battles and justice 
and strange things ahead of you. 
I can’t go. I’m too important. I’m 
too sweet! I’m too nice; I hate, 
hate, hate myself sometimes. 
Please, Casher, could you take a 
flier and run away with me into 
space?” 

“Your uncle’s lasers could cut 



US to pieces before we got out.” 

He held her hands and looked 
gently down into her face. At this 
moment he did not feel the fierce, 
aggressive, happy glow which an 
able young man feels in the pres- 
ence of a beautiful and tender 
young woman. He felt something 
much stranger, softer, quieter — 
an emotion very sweet to the 
mind and restful to the nerves. It 
was the simple, clear compassion 
of one person for another. He 
took a chance for her sake, be- 
cause the “dark knowledge” was 
wonderful but very dangerous in 
the wrong hands. 

He took both her beautiful lit- 
tle hands in hers, so that she 
looked up at him and realized 
that he was not going to kiss her. 
Something about his stance made 
her realize that she was being 
offered a more precious gift than 
a sky-lit romantic kiss in a gar- 
den. Besides, it was just touching 
helmets. 

He said to her, with passion 
and kindness in his voice; . 

“You remember that dog- 
woman, the one who works with 
the dishes in the hospital?” 

“Of course. She was good and 
bright and happy, and helped us 
all.” 

“Go work with her, now and 
then. Ask her nothing. Tell her 
nothing. Just work with her at 
her machines. Tell her I said so. 
Happiness is catching. You might 



catch it. I think I did myself, a 
little.” 

“I think I understand you,” said 
Genevieve softly. “Casher, good- 
by and good, good luck to you. 
Hdy uncle exp>ects us.” 

Together they went back into 
the palace. 

A nother memory was the 
farewell to Philip Vincent, 
the Hereditary Dictator of Pon- 
toppidan. The calm, clean-shaven, 
ruddy, well-fleshed face looked at 
him with benign regard. Casher 
O’Neill felt more respect for this 
man when he realized that ruth- 
lessness is often the price of 
peace, and vigilance the price of 
wealth. 

“You’re a clever young man. A 
very clever young man. You may 
win back the power of your uncle 
Kuraf.” 

“I don’t want that power!” 
cried Casher O’Neill. 

“I have advice for you,” said 
the Hereditary Dictator, “and it 
is good advice or I would not be 
here to give it. I have learned the 
political arts well: otherwise I 
would not be alive. Do not refuse 
power. Just take it and use it 
wisely. Do not hide from your 
wicked uncle’s name. Obliterate 
it. Take the name yourself and 
rule so well that, in a few decades, 
no one will remember your uncle. 
Just you. You are young. You 
can’t win now. But it is in your 



fate to grow and to triumph. I 
know it. I am good at these things. 
I have given you your weapon. I 
am not tricking you. It is packed 
safely and you may leave with 
it.” 

Casher O’Neill was breathing 
softly, believing it all, and trying 
to think of words to thank the 
stout, powerful older man when 
the dictator added. With a little 
laugh in his voice: 

“Thank you, too, for saving me 
money. You’ve lived up to your 
name, Casher.” 

“Saved you money?” 

“The alfalfa. The horse wanted 
alfalfa.” 

“Oh, that idea!” said Casher 
O’Neill. “It was obvious. I don’t 
deserve much credit for that.” 

“I didn’t think of it,” said the 
Hereditary Dictator, “and my 
staff didn’t either. We’re not 
stupid. That shows you are bright. 
You realized that Perino must 
have had a food converter to 
keep the horse alive in the Hippy 
Dipsy. All we did was set it to 
alfalfa and we saved ourselves 
the cost of a shipload of horse 
food twice a year. We’re glad to 
save that credit. We’re well off 
here, but we don’t like to waste 
things. You may bow to me now, 
and leave.” 

Casher O’Neill had done so, 
with one last glance at the lovely 
Genevieve, standing fragile and 
beautiful beside her uncle’s chair.

TTIS LAST memory was very 
recent. 

He had paid two hundred 
thousand credits for it, right on 
this liner. He had found the Stop- 
Captain, bored now that the ship 
was in flight and the Go-Captain 
had taken over. 

“Can you get me a telepathic 
fix on a horse?” 

“What’s a horse?” said the Go- 
Captain. “Where is it? Do you 
want to pay for it?” 

“A horse,” said Casher O’Neill 
patiently, “is an unmodified earth 
animal. Not underpeople. A big 
one, but quite intelligent. This 
one is in orbit right around Pon- 
toppidan. And I will pay the usu- 
al price.” 

“A million Earth credits,” said 
the Stop-Captain. 

“Ridiculous!” cried Casher 
O’Neill. 

They settled on two hvmdred 
thousand credits for a good fix 
and ten thousand for the use of 
the ship’s equipment even if there 
were failure. It was not a failure. 
The technician was a snake-man: 
he was deft, cool, and superb at 
his job. In only a few minutes he 
passed the headset to Casher 
O’Neill, saying politely, “This is 
it, I think.” 

It was. He had reached right 
into the horse’s mind. 

The endless sands of Mizzer 
swam before Casher O’Neill. The 




★ ★★★★ SHELF 



5 Star Shelf 



long lines of the Twelve Niles 
converged in the distance. He 
galloped steadily and powerfully. 
There were other horses nearby, 
other riders, other things, but he 
himself was conscious only of the 
beat of the hooves against the 
strong moist sand, the firmness of 
the appreciative rider upon his 
back. Dimly, as in a hallucination, 
Casher O’Neill could also see the 
little orbital ship in which the 
old horse cantered in mid-air, 
with an amused cadet sitting on 
his back. Up there, with no 
weight, the old worn-out heart 
would be good for many, many 
years. Then he saw the horse’s 
paradise again. The flash of 
hooves threatened to overtake 
him, but he outran them all. 
There was the expectation of a 
stable at the end, a rubdown, 
good succulent green food, and 
the glimpse of a filly in the morn- 
ing. 

The horse of Pontoppidan felt 
extremely wise. He had trusted 
people — people, the source of 
all kindness, all cruelty, all power 
among the stars. And the people 
had been good. The horse felt 
very much horse again. Casher 
felt the old body course along the 
river’s edge like a dream of 
power, like a completion of ser- 
vice, like an ultimate fulfilment 
of companionship.

t’DGAR RICE Burroughs bulks 
too large in the fantasy-ad- 
venture Hall of Fame to be read- 
ily crammed into the limited 
space of a single column such as 
this, especially since, after a hia- 
tus of a score of years, an -as- 
tonishing number of publishers 
are eager to gamble good money 
on the ability of his thundering 
adventures to woo the blase 
youth of today. So here is a sec- 
ond roundup of the Master. 

If the truth be known, I found 
it a most pleasant chore to reread 



the beloved fairy tales, even from 
the vantage point of our present 
pinnacle of scientific knowledge. 
Somehow, despite his frequently 
embarrassing awkwardness of 
style and the quaintness of his 
scientific background. Burroughs 
can still, to employ that over- 
worked phrase, evoke a “Sense 
of Wonder”. 

While Ace Books continues its 
policy of reissuing the old novels 
two per month in paperback, sev- 
eral other publishers have joined 
them on the Burroughs band-

wagon. The most ambitious of 
these is Canaveral Press. They 
have already released eleven 
hardcovers: four Pellucidar 

books, a couple of Martian novels 
and a couple of the memorable 
single shots: The Land That Time 
Forgot, The Cave Girl, The Mon- 
ster Men and the first of the 
Venusian novels, Pirates of Ve- 
nus. 

Thuvia, Maid of Mars, The 
Chessmen of Mars and The Mas- 
ter Mind of Mars — fourth, fifth 
and sixth in the Martian series 
— are all in a fine paperback vol- 
ume issued by Dover Publica- 
tions. It is surprising that Dover 
elected to start the series in the 
middle but, since only the first 
three, or John Carter, stories are 
sequential, nothing is lost. The 
Dover editors also showed wis- 
dom in including most of the orig- 
inal artwork by J. Allen St. John, 
who was a whiz at depicting Bur- 
roughs’s muscular men, chaste 
and voluptuous women and mon- 
strous monsters. 

A surprise entry in the Bur- 
roughs Stakes is Ballantine 
Books, who have announced their 
intention to reissue the entire 
Martian series, one volume per 
month. Since there are ten books 
in the series, they will obviously 
be well occupied for most of a 
year . further plans depending 
upon the degree of acceptance by 
their paying public. 



THE LAND THAT TIME FOR. 
GOT. Canaveral Press. 

Canaveral is the only publisher 
so far to reissue what must be 
considered the most noteworthy 
of Burroughs’s singles. 

Because Burroughs wrote when 
many areas of the world map re- 
mained blank, he was always on 
the lookout for an exotic, un- 
known region in which to base a 
story. Caprona, the mythical con- 
tinent of compass-deflecting met- 
al that the eighteenth century 
Italian navigator, Caproni, re- 
ported as lying deep in South 
Pacific waters, was a natural for 
his choice of a locale in which to 
plant the seed of an intriguing 
mystery. 

Burroughs’s huge island, pro- 
tected from external weather by 
high sheer cliffs, duplicates eons 
of evolution by geographical 
means. The low, steamy atmos- 
phere of the south is analogous 
to that of the reptilian eras and, 
as the land gradually rises to the 
north, flora and fauna rise cor- 
respondingly on the evolutionary 
scale. ERB utilizes this back- 
ground for a startling concept 
His island humans evolve outside 
the womb, traversing the island 
from south to north and rising 
from tadpole to full human es- 
tate. 

The novel, one of the author’s 
longest, was written in the fiercely 
chauvinistic atmosphere of WW I 

GALAXY 



but contains sheer, headlong ad- 
venture that is unusual even for 
an §RB thriller. 

A FIGHTING MAN OF MARS. 
Both Canaveral Press and Ace 
Books. 

TO A marked degree, it ap- 
pears as if Burroughs patterned 
many of his stories after the 
Arabian Nights. There are simi- 
lar exotic environments, almost 
identical social structures, polyg- 
amy (practiced only by the bad 
guys, of course); slavery is nor- 
mal, and precious jewels and gor- 
geous silks and tapestries are 
flaunted before the imaginative 
eye of the reader. 

Also, Burroughs’s scientific 
marvels are seldom woven into 
the fabric of his cultures, as is 
the way with modern science fic- 
tion, but are exploited for their 
semi-magical shock value ... in 
much the same manner that the 
powers of the Jinn were em- 
ployed to twist a plot in extra- 
ordinary fashion. 

The Burroughs stories abound 
in abductions, and Fighting Man 
is no exception. Hadron of Has- 
tor pursues the (polygamous) vil- 
lains back to Jahar, a country 
whose cowardly ruler schemes to 
conquer all of Barsoom through 
the (semi-magical) twin inven- 
tions of the paint of invisibility 
and the ray of disintegration. 

Burroughs’s choice of a model 

★ ★★★★ SHELF 



was a wise one. The Arabian 
Nights are corking good adven- 
ture stories in their own right. 

THE MONSTER MEN. Both 
Canaveral Press and Ace Books. 
CANAVERAL AND Ace have 
both reissued the above with 
Ace having an edge both in price 
and in artwork. The Canaveral 
editors exercised poor judgment 
in their choice of Mahlon Blaine 
as illustrator for several of their 
books. His delicate, unearthly 
pictures are eminently suited for 
stories such as those of H. P. 
Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith or 
James Branch Cabell but not for 
the muscular fantasy of Bur- 
roughs. There are rumors, how- 
ever, that these illustrations are 
to be redone by Frank Frazetta, 
who, ironically, illustrated the 
Ace edition of Monster Men and 
who captures the essence of the 
stories to far greater degree. 

Although this book suffers from 
some of Burroughs’s worst writing, 
there is still a lot of excitement 
in his tale of a subman who dis- 
covers that he is really a super- 
man. 

TARZAN AT THE EARTH’S 
CORE. Ace Books, Dover Pub- 
lications, Canaveral Press. 
DAVID INNES, Emperor of 
Pellucidar, immured in the dun- 
geons of Korsar, is in deep 
trouble (no pun intended) and 



120 



121 



Tarzan is summoned to the res- 
cue. The relief expedition that he 
is asked to join has constructed a 
giant rigid dirigible of an ex- 
tremely light and strong metal 
that Tarzan had conveniently dis- 
covered in some lost mines, 
strong enough to contain a vac- 
uum. 

T.A.T.E.C. was written shortly 
after the Italian dirigible, Norge, 
had safely negotiated a passage 
over the North Pole in the 1920’s 
and at a time when rigid lighter- 
than-air ships appeared to hold 
the key to massive commercial 
and military conquest of the air. 

For convenience, and also to 
exploit the contemporary lack of 
contrariwise proof. Burroughs en- 
visioned a polar opening through 
which to insert his favorite hero 
into the mixed-up ecology of the 
inner world. The gigantic rep- 
tilian and mammalian carnivores 
of Pellucidar are far more suit- 
able adversaries for Tarzan than 
the badly overmatched denizens 
of our modern jungles. 

Burroughs, incidentally, ad- 
vances the interesting theory, as 
good as any, that the giant car- 
nivores might have been the 
agents of their own destruction 
on the outer crust by developing 
intelligence of high enough order 
to enable them to hunt coopera- 
tively in concert, hastening the 
extinction of their natural prey 
and themselves. 



THE CAVE GIRL. Canaveral 
Press. 

BURROUGHS MUST have writ- 
ten this story with tongue in 
cheek. He casts away his hero, a 
Bostonian with the unlikely name 
of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, 
on a tiny, unchartfed South Pa- 
cific island to face primitive cave- 
people and a wild environment 
more suited to the specialized tal- 
ents of Tarzan. 

Smith-Jones fumbles his way, 
successfully of course, through a 
typical Burroughs adventure 
yarn, which is sufficient reason 
for the ardent Burroughs fan to 
have made this one of the scarcest 
of collector’s items during recent 
dearth of Burroughs books. 

PIRATES OF VENUS. Dover 
Publications, Canaveral Press, 
Ace Books. 

THREE PUBLISHERS have 
all taken a crack at this Bur- 
roughs classic. Ace, in paperback, 
is of course the bargain of the 
lot. The hardcover edition, with 
the powerful advantage of origi- 
nal illustrations by J. Allen St. 
John, is by Canaveral, while 
Dover has coupled it with Lost 
on Venus as a quality paperback 
edition. The latter I haven’t yet 
seen, but Dover assures me that 
it is as well executed as its Three 
Martian Novels and will also con- 
tain a selection of the original 
St. John illustrations. 



122 



GALAXY 



Burroughs turned to Venus for 
inspiration after he had pretty 
well exhausted the melodramatic 
potential of Mars. His hero. Car- 
son Napier, out-did “Wrong-Way 
Corrigan” by a considerable 
stretch both in time and error by 
aiming for Mars and reaching 
Venus. Despite his usual pen- 
chant for coincidence and gratui- 
tously fortuitous happenstances 
(whew!), his power of invention 
in the realm of pure adventure 
remains keen throughout the 
Venusian series. 

In addition to the above, Dover 
also plan to bring out coupled 
volumes of other titles. 

Ballantine, of all the involved 
publishers, is releasing its vol- 
umes in sequence, starting with 
A Princess of Mars, the first in 
the series, and also the first Bur- 
roughs novel ever to be published 
(he used the pseudonym, Norman 
Bean), and following it with The 
Gods of Mars, etc. 

It is surprising how the wheel 
has suddenly turned, thrusting 
Burroughs back into prominence 
after two decades of obscurity. He 
wrote a total of twenty-four Tar- 
zan books, ten Martian, four Ve- 
nusian and five Pellucidarian 
novels, as well as a large number 
of single titles. It remains to be 
seen whether this huge legacy 
of adventure will be allowed to 
die for a second, and possibly 
final time. — FLOYD C. GALE

work.” 

I’ll get o'ff the mark at this law- 
yer’s office. I was there to get 
shown my Pop was a dust-eater. 
Wotta laff! I was right up in the

Pop came right back like the 
great sportsfan he is, “Well, we 
can contest those two-bit charges 
I hadn’t time to fight when they 
were made. I know they can’t de- 
bar me finally on imcontested 
stuff.” 

The old guy looped down his 
eyelids: “If you’d ever bothered 
to appear in court yourself, or 
even read the transcripts, you 
would also know that all charges 
have been contested. Apparently 
you’ve been so cotton-wooled by 
insurance and connections and 
smart lawyers, you think you can 
brush off even child-murder.” 

Pop bounced up, ready to 
ditch the moke: “Why, you . ! ” 
“Your failure was no thanks to 
you. Would you have to kill chil- 
dren in actual fact to sober you? 
The commimity is not minded to 
let you try the experiment. This 
isn’t 1975, you know.” 

The two-timing old right-laner! 
I’d been told to keep my muffler 
cut, but there’s times when you 
surge or burst. I surged, “And 
don’t we ever get to score? A 
bunch of mokes get him in a jam, 
and a fresh cop calls us Flight of 
the Stumblebum — because we 
have a yellow ’n’ black zoom. 
Does my Pop have to take that 
gravel?” 

Craik looked at me like I was 
a parking ticket. ‘Well, I suppose 
a lad should be loyal to his fath- 
er. Pity it’s not in a better cause. 



So, yes, my budding Big Shot, 
he does. On triple probation, he 
drove with such dashing irresp)on- 
sibility that he sheared off three 
steel guard-posts and barely 
missed a group of children. He’ll 
take what anyone calls him, and 
thank them it wasn’t worse.” He 
swung back at Pop. “I took your 
case to pay off a favor to Sam 
Hardy. I consider I’ve paid in 
full. And the case is closed.” 

Pop kept a manly silence. 
Mom took over: “But, Mr. Craik, 
how can my husband do business 
without a car? A Plutomat repre- 
sentative can’t walk up to a pros- 
pect’s door like a peddler. This 
destroys my family’s livelihood.” 

“Your husband should have 
considered that sooner, Mrs. 
Blaire.” 

My rad just boiled to hear her 
having to take the old honk-honk 
from minions of the law. I’ve 
never been much on girls because 
Mom is my ideal, and only my 
young sister Judy comes in that 
custom model. And I was just a 
skinny Teener, helpless to defend 
the family honor. But I sneaked 
a squeeze of her hand. 

Pop said grimly, “Then these 
fanatics have ruined me. I have 
no place to go in this so-called 
Free World.” 

Craik shrugged: “Then find a 
Parallel that will take you, and 
get Translated, Mr. Blaire. That 
would solye everybody’s prob- 

GALAXY 



lems.” Obviously he was including 
his own. 

I p>erked up. Translation, 
switch to a parallel time, might 
be good. 

Pop said, “That costs a for- 
tune.” 

Craik shrugged again: “It 

might cost less than your daunt- 
less career here. I’ll send my ac- 
count.” He froze us out like trash. 



C 



T his record being for poster- 

i 



ity, I better give the true facts 
which are already being sup- 
pressed. Because I’ve boned up 
on them. 

So, this LLL pest started in 
’75, the Golden Age of Go. A 
bunch called the Regular Guys 
had gotten the laws modemated 
— “safe and reasonable speed,” 
^ nationwide. They backed Bucky 
^ Kooznik who’d been framed in a 



speed-trap, and won in Supreme 



Court. They backed Senator 
Smurge for Vice President — the 
prince who got a national speed 
law laughed into the wreckers by 
tacking on an amendment to 
make the limit ninety — and got 
him in. 

Well, this low-octane third 
party, the Life and Limb League 
(Lily-Livered Limks, we called 
them) tried to buck the traffic. 
Their candidate. Bob Green, had 
had a kid killed and had sort of 
blown his tires. Well, sure, like 

t Pop says, it’s too bad but we can’t 



all live in bungalows because kids 
fall downstairs. An 5 rway, LLL got 
a loud boff and lost all its de- 
posits. Only Green kept squawk- 
ing about how hiway deaths 
jumped from 87,000 in ’76, to 
116,000 in ’78; and he signed up 
relatives and friends of “victims,” 
and soreheads who’d got bunged 
up and couldn’t be sports about 
it, and natural-bom cranks and 
scaredy-pants. You wouldn’t 
think people would vote to get 
themselves traffic tickets. But in 
’78, LLL won seats in Congress, 
and more in ’80. 

So we stopped laughing and 
fought back. We sued a paper for 
a cartoon of Smurge with his 
arms around a goony driver and 
a skeleton, saying, “My Buddies!” 
And the court ratted on us, and 
it upheld disgusting photos of 
crashes and libels that said more 
than “the car went out of con- 
trol.” So drivers got nervous and 
the “toll” climbed on. 

Then, in ’84,. Green got in, and 
showed what a fanatic at the 
wheel will do. Laws, laws, laws. 
We said “They can’t arrest every- 
body.” Oh, no? Fines, confisca- 
tions, jail for thousands of re- 
spectable people. And a Gestapo 
of Lily-white drivers’d sp)ot you 
using the old elbow or boomin’ 
the amber, and you’d get a stink- 
ing card that you’d lost points. 
Twenty-five peints got you a fine 
and a goo-talk about “mental at- 



A DAY ON DEATH HIGHWAY 



126 



127 



titudes”. Blah! What about guts 
and skill and all that? 

Well, we figured there’d soon 
be enough people sore to give us 
a comeback. So LLL claimed 
they’d saved 30,000 lives in ’85. 
So what the heck, it wouldn’t 
have been you anyway. But there 
aren’t many real fighters like Pop, 
and the Old Cause was driven to 
the curb. 

P had to drive home real 
humble because if they 
caught him now, they’d jail him, 
him, a free citizen. But he was 
looking stern and unbowed, like 
a guerrilla hero in Tri-Di. 

So presently I said, “Pop, let’s 
do it!” 

Mogi chimed in, “Yes, Gail, if 
you can’t work here, let’s at least 
ask about it.” Mom’s real practi- 
cal under the hood. 

Judy was keen too. At four- 
teen, in Ye Good Olde Daze, 
she’d have been a zee already. 
Now, she’d have to wait two 
years. 

So Pop got into passing gear. 
And just a week later he came 
home with his hat cocked and his 
heels clicking, and summoned us 
all to the tridiroom. “Well, keeds,” 
he said, “they sure picked on the 
wrong man when they picked on 
ol’ Buck Blaire. Biggest favor 
anyone ever did us. It seems 
there’s a world called Jehu (some 
crackjaw gibberish in their lan- 



guage) after some old prophet. 
Anyway, Plutomat’s granted me 
planetary franchise. Izzat good or 
is it? 

“And tape this, keeds! That 
planet’s set up for adults. They’re 
drivin’ fools, wonderful roads, 
most powerful zooms anywhere, 
and, get this, nary a traffic law or 
a traffic court on the planet.” 

Judy puzzled: “But, Daddy 
they must have some laws, like 
which side you drive on . .” 

Pop’s always indulged Judy. 
“Well, honey, that’s rules; and 
anyone with sense knows when 
rules do and don’t matter. Like if 
I drive on the left on an empty 
street, whose business is it? See, 
Judy, put deadheads off the road, 
leave things to skill and experi- 
ence and you’re safe. Their acci- 
dent-rate’s just about nil — natu- 
rally.” 

“Well, it sounds funny to me. 
You be careful.” Mom said. 

“You been skull-scrubbed by 
Triple-L, keed? You never come 
out front unless you muscle into 
openings, like fast That’s the se- 
cret of all big operators — Cesar, 
Napoleon, Buck Blaire — split-sec- 
ond decisions. We’ve gotta take 
off in a cloud of clamshells, and 
we can’t wait for a lecture course. 
But you can vote on it. Now. All 
in favor of saying Nay, say Aye. 
Nobody? Carried! Oh, by the 
way, old Craik ain’t such a bad 
old moke after all. He tipped me 




128 



GALAXY 



off on this Jehu place himself the 
other day.” 

“Huh!” I thought. “7 wouldn’t 
trust that pussy-schnook much.” 

But Pop took off with his rub- 
ber scorchin’: Plutomat contract. 
Translation permit, appointment 
with the movers. The skids and 
zees in my gang were cynical; 
but I knew I’d get my own back, 
and I just sat tight and soaked 
up Jehuan by hypnophone. 

Came The Day. A crew put up 
a frame around our lot, higher 
than the house, and into the 
ground. I asked the foreman if it 
marked out the block that was 
going to be swapped with a block 
of Jehu. 

“You aren’t as dumb as you 
look, kid,” he said, “which must 
be a consolation to your folks. 
That’s what it does.” 

“Thanx,” I said and strolled 
off. Gee, I hate a fresh guy! 

Sure, a butterfly-collector 
could have had a field-day in my 
stomach, when the fresh foreman 
called all his gang out and began 
countdown. Mom and Judy were 
too bunny to come out, but Pop 
and I stood on the steps. I felt 
revved up, then, like beating an- 
other zoom around a curve, and 
at Minus Five I called to all the 
skids in the crowd watching, 
“Here go the Regulars. We will 
Return!” like that historical guy 
on tri-di. Pop just stood stern and 
unbowed. 



Vj^OTTA zump! Fifty light- 
years? Gimme a yippee-cart 
on Thrill-Hill! No stars streaking 
past, no roar, no icy chill. Just a 
j utter in your gizzard and there 
you were on a street like the old 
one with the houses shuffled. 
Even the crew to take down the 
frame looked the same. But not 
the guy who was there to wel- 
come us; he had a lah-de-dah 
coat with wide skirts and lace 
like in Abe Washington’s time, 
but he was a big, hard-looking 
zow like a zoom-bike cop. His 
zoom was a weirdy, too. Whee 
enough like an import job and 
done in this novelty one-tone fin- 
ish, but no jem-krust trim, no 
swordfish roof-crest, no flared 
bumpers; it wouldn’t have helped 
eggo much. The only real 
decoration was a leaping red ti- 
ger on all panels. He said he was 
to be our Patron, name of Thran- 
gar Glash. 

I gave him the old Hi-de-ho 
and he froze my fuel-line. But 
when Mom and Judy came out, 
he swooned them with his bow- 
ing and oil-pressure. And when 
Mom was disappointed at the 
view, he explained, “This is just 
the Terran suburb. Madam. 
When I have advised you all on 
our, ah, driving customs, you can 
visit the main city.” 

Pop scowled: “I was told you 
drove by common sense.” 

Glash gave him a lopsided 



A DAY ON DEATH HIGHWAY 



129 



look: “True. But common sense 
differs in different places, sir. 
Shall we go in?” 

So we did, and Pal Patron 
Glash gave us the route-map. 
And had I been mucho right 
about old Schnooks Craik! 

Sure, they had no traffic laws 
or cops, no penalty points, no 
fines, no nothing. Sure! Only just 
this: If you merely annoyed an- 
other driver, much less bent his 
tin, he could challenge you to 
fight him. They fought in a pub- 
lic arena, on a sort of yippee-cart 
called a whippet, with sort of 
bull-whips. You wore leather ar- 
mor, only the defender got less 
and darn little if he’d hurt or 
killed someone. “ ‘Course,” Glash 
drawled, “even for blood-guilt, 
the limit’s twenty minutes, and 
sometimes a dashing player 
comes off with his life.” 

“His 1-life?” Mom said. “With 
whips?” 

“Oh, a very spirited weapon, 
ma’am. I’ve dueled little, having 
been bred to courtesy but — ” he 
touched his left cheek, which was 
all scarred — “one keeps in prac- 
tice with one-cheek affairs, in case 
one becomes seriously involved.” 

So he gave us the layout, and 
they had it set up like some game. 
Kids, gals, old gaffers, if you 
drove you were liable. No subs, 
not for wives or kids or sweeties. 
Only a Court of Honor appointed 
one if a bully had fixed a fight on 



somebody weaker or when an in- 
nocent guy was killed or disabled. 
A woman bashed a man’s zoom, 
she fought. Fair enough. Like pal 
Thrangar said, “We’re all equal, 
eh? Well, there’s no chivalry be- 
tween equals, only courtesy.” 
And if you didn’t play up you 
were outlaw and they’d ram you 
or run you off the road and you 
had no comeback. All tied up 
tighter ’n a sales contract. 

Finally Pop said, “I’ve been 
framed. I was lied into this.” 

“Really, sir? Our embassy pro- 
vided no literature?” 

Well, who reads literature? 
The real dope they’ll shove in 
your face. Pop always says. And 
they hadn’t. So it was same as 
lying. Huh? 

Pop said, “I was told this was 
a free society.” 

“My dear Blaire, a society is 
free only to choose its rules. An 
aggressive race like yours, or 
mine, craves to domineer. You’ve 
got to control that itch from run- 
ning wild in millions of free spir- 
its.” 

“Yeh-yeh, sure. By common 
sense. Now me . .” 

“Ah, yours, naturally. Mine 
too, I trust. But — everyone’s? No, 
you’ve just three systems that 
work: Public law, which irked 
you; posse law to hunt down 
pests which — ” he flicked an eye- 
brow — “irked you even more; or 
a code of honor.” 



Pop scowled. He always says, 
the first freedom oughta be free- 
dom from preach. Then he hit 
back: “O-kay! Anything you jok- 
ers can do, I can pass you.” 

And I felt proud again. 

“True sporting spirit, sir. So, 
study our code and our manners 
in practice. Get your whippet and 
join a school of arms. Then I’ll 
introduce you to our Arena.” And 
he flourished himself out. 

Back in the hall. Pop said 
“Hullo!” and picked up a letter 
that must have come before we 
left Earth. Inside was a sheet of 
letterhead, “Craik, Creak, Croak 
and Crock,” and on it, in quotes: 
“When insolence outruneth 
law, men customarily arm them- 
selves to chastise offense on the 
body of the offender. As the prov- 
erb saith: No courtesy sans valor.” 
Leon da Milhao. 
The old speed-trap! He was 
giving us the razz. But we’ll show 
him. 

II 

Oct. 3, 1987 

W ELL, we’ve started. At first 
Pop was sore all the time, 
like he was stuck behind a squad- 
car. At dinner he’d burst out, 
“Ahhh, what yokels! Yap-yap with 
the horns every move you make, 
yap-yap. Back-seat driving from 
other people’s back seats — it’s 



going to rattle even me into 
fender-denting. It’s a good thing 
our Thunderbolt Twelve can ac- 
celerate out of anything these 
lunks can mess up.” 

“Ahh, you’ve been skull- 
scrubbed by Triple-L. Let ’em 
try.” 

As for us, this town’s got noth- 
ing for Teeners. Whippet-school 
could be fun. Whippets are like 
a yippee-cart with a saddle in- 
stead of a seat, to give you free 
action; not real fast because you 
fight in a half-mile arena, but 
they turn like squirrels. But the 
teacher red-lights any fun. He 
has moustaches like wind-swept 
fenders, and he’s worse than the 
horn-yappers : “Do that over, 

young fool. Recover, recover, 
you’ll get your face opened. With 
little-stuff brains don’t try to be 
big stuff.” Spoils your nerve. I’m 
beginning to catch on. Mom’s 
slower, and she won’t drive on 
the street nohow, even with the 
novice plates. Judy’s real sharp, 
but Mom won’t let her out either, 
in spite of her having natural- 
born driving rights here. 

But Pop’s a wham, a natural. 
After lesson 3, he came striding 
out: “See me clip the pro, keeds? 
I think I’m gonna like this.” 

“You’ll feel different if you 
were risking a real cut, Gail.” 

“Nyahhh! Steady nerve and ed- 
ucated reflexes, that’s real safe- 
ty.”

A DAY ON DEATH HIGHWAY 



131 



Well, on the way home, there’s 
this traffic signal down past our 
house. You don’t have to stop, 
just yield right-of-way which Pop 
says makes sense, though the 
other zoom’s gotta be half across 
for Pop to yield, but Jehuans 
treat them real bunny. So, this 
native zoom ahead of us dragged 
down slow to make the corner 
just as it changed, like mokes do. 
Well, we should linger while he 
played games? Pop whipped the 
Stumblebum past and across the 
guy’s front into our drive, spray- 
in’ gravel, and pulled the foam- 
ing steeds to their haunches. Ye 
Olde High Style! 

So here comes this Jehuan 
stalking across the lawn, a skin- 
ny guy in floppy green. He makes 
a bow to Mom and Ju and a 
stiff inch to Pop: “Sir, you drive 
with novice plates.” 

“A blind cop could see that.” 
Pop said, “What about it?” 

“Just this, sir. When you can 
no longer hide behind them, you 
will put your hog’s elbow in my 
face again, and I will bleed your 
insolence. I will watch for you, 
believe me.” 

“Don’t bother,” Pop said. “Gim- 
me your address, and I’ll drive 
up and down your block till you 
come out — if you do.” 

So the guy gave him a card 
and bowed himself off. Pop 
looked after him, jingling his 
pockets. “He’ll do to start on.” 



tT^HEN Glash took us to the 
Arena, in his zoom. I’ll say 
this for Jehuans, when they go, 
they Go; so when they do tangle, 
it’s a dilly. We went down the 
main drag in a stream of zooms 
at sixty steady, with Glash giving 
exhaust about the average being 
twice the speed in any Earth 
city, and how he never needed 
to use his brakes. Sure, but in 
two blocks I was antsy-pantsy 
with that old bull-man urge-to- 
surge, while Glash defaulted 
chance after chance to Score. 

So, out where you’d expect a 
ball-park, was this Arena like the 
Colossus of Rome. It wasn’t a 
tenth full, but two guys were 
looping and lashing, like at the 
school only more exciting be- 
cause they had open left cheeks. 
But neither scored, and another 
pair took over. 

Glash looked bored and I lost 
interest too after five of these 
quickies and only one guy cut. 
But people kept trickling in, and 
Glash said, “Ah! About time for 
the main event. This high-ridin’ 
ass, y’know, ran down a child on 
a back street. City’s been debatin’ 
how much leather he should get 
for challenger’s parental negli- 
gence. I hear it’s only a collar. 
Minimum. A cut to the larynx 
or big neck vessels ends a bout 
without a sportin’ chance.” 

Pop said real cool, “Well, what 
chance does that give him? 



132 



GALAXY 



“Say fifty to one. Challenger’s 
a tough whip and deadly angry.” 

Mom and Ju looked green. 
They’ve stopped more than once 
to view a crash but maybe they 
figured deliberate gore was some- 
thing else. 

Mom said, “Well, I don’t think 
the little girl should see this.” 

Glash made a fish-mouth: “I 
cannot agree, madam. If a child 
isn’t blooded young, it’ll play the 
fool in emergencies.” 

Just then, a referee came out 
on a platform halfway down the 
arena and the duellers appeared 
at opposite ends with their sec- 
onds and doctors, which they 
have for serious fights. 

People were piling in till there 
wasn’t standing room. 

My heart was going bu-bop 
bu-bop. 

Glash drawled, “Ha! They’ve 
made challenger bare his right 
arm. That narrows the odds 
somewhat. This should be a nota- 
ble Drive.” 

Yehr, and he’d fixed to have 
us see the execution. Thanx! 

Came a pistol-shot that yanked 
the props out from my stomach. 

The crowd gasped “Off!” Then 
not a peep — you could be 
challenged yourself for a disturb- 
ance. You could hear the motors 
snarl, even the sand grunt at 
swerves. 

They didn’t come right in, like 
in spite-fights. Defender swung 



wide and then, when challenger 
closed, whipped behind him on 
two wheels and zipped down the 
arena. And they kept on swing- 
in’er big and snappin’er tight till 
I began to think defender would 
make it. Then a look at the big 
arena clock showed only six min- 
utes gone. 

Challenger had lashed twice 
and missed. Then, before I knew 
it, he did a skid-curve and nicked 
defender’s shoulder. Not much, 
but the guy began to bleed, lost 
his nerve and got two more in 
two minutes. 

He pulled himself together and 
kept clear for a bit again. Then, 
just half-time, he goofed. He’d 
got on challenger’s tail, and the 
old scoring spirit surged, and he 
took a crack at him. It only hit 
leather, and a crack costs time. 
Challenger veered, slam-braked, 
swiped as the guy shot past and 
scored an awful slice on his arm. 

Well, that was it. Defender 
dropped his whip and just 
steered. But he was dazed and 
losing blood. Challenger flicked 
and flicked. 

I got all churned up. Here was 
this guy, could see the arena, and 
hear the whippets yarrr, and feel 
his cuts. And if he didn’t do more 
than he could do, in a couple of 
minutes he wouldn’t know any- 
thing. 

Same time, challenger was 
coming through like on mental 



A DAY ON DEATH HIGHWAY 



133 



FM: “She’ll never pounce onto 
the bed with me again. (Crack!) 
Never have college and a wed- 
ding. (Crack!) How many thou- 
sand of your smart tricks was 
that worth? (Ca-rack!)’’ It made 
me sick and dry. 

Defender played so crazy, he 
hung on for a bit, and I began 
to wonder again, would he make 
it. Six to go and my lungs were 
tied in a bownot. Challenger 
figure-8ed but reversed in the 
second loop; defender saw a big 
body-slash coming, just too late. 
He banked so tight, he toppled. 
He kicked the ejector-lever and 
flung clear. 

Everybody stood up. 

He spread-eagled, like in a 
wreck I saw once, and his whip- 
pet batted around spinning and 
scrabbling on its side. Challenger 
cut around it so sharp, I thought 
he’d tip too, and headed straight 
for the guy. Defender tried to 
heave clear . “My little honey!” 
. Ribs crack like wet sticks . 

Nobody talked. Even Garsh 
didn’t pump any pi-jaw. 

But when we got home and 
Mom was hoping that now he 
wouldn’t take so many chances. 
Pop said, “Look, keed, in this 
life you take chances or live in 
a keg. You just gotta be equal to 
them.” 

And the very day the novice 
plates came off the Stumblebum, 
he came home whistling and an- 

134 



nounced he’d fixed a fight with 
this guy who’d left his address. 
“Keep me in practice, like Garsh 
says.” 

Well, I guess he needs it. So 
far, they could only yap>-yap 
when he double-parked at rush- 
hour, or blocked a side-street, or 
motor-boated through puddles. 
Now, he’ll spend half his time in 
that arena. And some day he’ll 
outsmart himself into a biggie. 

Ill 

Oct. 28, ’87. 

^^HE day of his first duel. Pop 
came home .free-wheeling as 
a tomcat. Ju and I had the day 
off from school, but we weren’t 
going. “No family,” Pop had said. 
“This new back-seat driving 
would put me off. I could feel it 
from ’way up in the stands. Jone- 
sie and I have arranged to back 
each other in these deals.” So he 
had lunch and they took off on 
their whippets. 

I got myself into sporting bags 
for an afternoon all to myself 
with the zoom, and tip-toed down 
to the garage. 

Well, the zoom was gone. That 
stalled me. Pop had his whippet. 
Mom still wouldn’t drive a block 
alone, or let Judy, to Ju’s perma- 
nent sulk. Maybe Mom and Ju 
. .? Then I heard Mom upstairs, 
and called, “Mom, where’s Ju?” 

Mom dashed down like beat- 

G AL AX Y 



ing an amber. But no Ju any- 
where. Mom kept breathing, 
“The little fool! Oh, the little 
fool!” Then aloud, “She’s your 
father all over. Oh, if she’s gone 
in that car . .” 

Of course, Ju had. Pop’s fight 
had revved her up to thiry over 
the limit, and she’d gone to see. 
Like that, she was a suicide men- 
ace. 

The police just shrugged over 
the phone: “Driving is private 
business, madam. We do not in- 
terfere.” (Pop’s standby!) 

So, without a car, what could 
we do? Mom took a calmifier 
and lay down. I sat on the front 
steps and strewed cigarette butts. 

At that, I didn’t see Judy com- 
ing till she turned up the walk, 
on foot. She was a mess, all 
blowsy from crying. If she’d 
crossed many streets, it was just 
luck we didn’t have to whip 
someone for running her down. 
She blubbered, “Du-don’t start 
ku-questions, pu-p/ease.” But 
Mom didn’t swallow that line 
and shook her till her hair 
flopped. So she told. 

She was near the Arena, feel- 
ing pretty high, when some moke 
ahead slowed for a right turn, 
like mokes do. Well, you don’t 
pass any faster, I guess, but a 
Regular like Pop swings big left 
to show his Style and opinion of 
mokes. So naturally Ju swung 
and bashed head-on into another 

A DAY ON DEATH HIGI 



zoom at these Jehu speeds. She 
said, “The wu-woman was in the 
middle, I swear. But she claims 
she hadn’t room.” 

Another woman was bad. Even 
against rules, men often go easy 
on a girl; a woman, never. This 
zee claimed injury, and several 
other drivers were mad enough 
to swear anything. This wouldn’t 
be any one-check deal. 

We were so razzed, we never 
heard the whipj>et pull in. 

But I heard Pop clickety- 
clacking up the path, and got to 
the tridiroom door as he flipped 
his hat onto the rack: “Well, well, 
is this all the victor’s welcome? 
Where’s Mom and Judy?” 

Mom pushed by me and stood 
glaring at him. But Pop never 
did notice red lights much. He 
breezed on, “Yezzir! Ol’ Killer 
Blaire clipped him, and him a 
thirty-fight veteran. And not a 
mark on me. Reflexes, like I’ve 
always told you. Now, how’s 
about . .” 

Well, I’d seen it in boffies but 
never expected to in real life. 
Mom smashed a vase-lamp on 
his head and towered over him. 
“Well, that’s a mark on you now. 
Reflex-brains!” . and told him 
the score in about ten words, end- 
ing, “And I haven’t raised a sweet 
child to be disfigured because her 
father’s a retarded Teener.” 

“Aw right, aw right! No reason 
to blow your tires at me. What’ve 

WAY 135 



/ done? We’ll fix it. I suppose 
you never thought of Clash?” 
She said, soft, “You fix it. You 
call Clash, you and your steel 
nerves. I don’t believe you grasp 
the situation yet.” 

He slouched to the phone and 
I snaked up to the bedroom 
phone extension. Well, Clash had 
a big pick-up for Judy, like they 
all do, but he couldn’t fix the 
ticket. “Blaire, if defender could 
substitute, I’d go in for her my- 
self. What was the woman’s in- 
signia? . Red tornado? Hah! 
Slada Coy, hard as they come 
. No, you fool! You mention 
money, you’ll be outlawed . 
You’ve no damn right to be ig- 
norant of manners, sir.” I’ve 
never seen Pop so slowed down. 
Even Mom’s laid off him. 

Dec. 1, 1987. 

T’VE NEVER lived through 
-*• such a grim month. Judy had 
lessons daily, and then I’d prac- 
tice her. No bon. She was great 
in rehearsal, but in that Arena 
she’d freeze. She knew girls at 
school who’d been cut. She’d nev- 
er been really hurt in her life, 
and got shivering sick just at the 
idea. It sure dulled her polish; 
and yet, she was more appealing 
to me, like when she was a brat 
and I’d pick her up when her 
Toddle Typhoon dumped. 

It wasn’t fair. Pop’s a real 
hero-type adult to these Teeners. 



/ 

Was she supposed not to learn 
off him? And he’d never get 
touched. 

Then this Slada’s deputies 
came, big squaws with muscles 
in their calves, and tried to right- 
lane Mom because she’s custom- 
built and they were trucks. But 
Mom had evidently boned up on 
Jehu law, and beat the time 
down from twelve to ten min- 
utes, and fixed Judy’s leather so 
she’d only have one arm exposed 
besides her cheek, and sent them 
off bow-legged. I felt real proud 
of Mom then. 

But it wouldn’t help Ju. Five 
minutes would be too much. And 
a week before the fight, she 
podded into my room in her bath- 
robe and plopped on my bed: 
“Oh Chuck, what’ll I do-oo-oo? 
We’ll be put off the road here too 
and Daddy’ll be ruined. Bu-bu- 
but I can’t fight that awful old 
woman. I couldn’t even steer.” 
Well, I’d hoped for a break in 
the traffic; now I’d have to elbow 
one. I patted her shoulder: 
“Opey-dopey, kid. I’ll fix it.” 

She grabbed me: “How? Dad- 
dy can’t. Mr. Clash can’t.” 

“I’m not much bigger’n you. In 
leathers, nobody’d know the dif- 
ference. I’ll fight her.” 

“Oh, but Ghuckie, I beat you 
all the time at school.” 

“So who cares if my manly 
beauty gets marked?” 

I bet we both slept well that 



136 



GALAXY 



night, for just about the first time 
in weeks. 

OOTH our leathers had Pop’s 
charging-quarterback insignia 
and Ju faked her 4 for my 3 on 
mine and fixed some of her 
slacks to fit me. 

Came the day. I was to drive 
the whippet to the Arena, while 
the others followed in the car — 
Pop’s real expert at getting dead- 
line repairs done. So, I sneaked 
off in Ju’s slacks, with makeup 
and a kerchief to hide my buzz- 
cut, and parked in the entrance 
tunnel to Defenders’ End. And 
right on tick, Ju came out of 
Lady Defenders’ Dressing Room 
and dodged around into the pub- 
lic Ladies’ Room. I skulked after 
her. We took adjoining booths, 
and clothes came flying over the 
partition. And with three minutes 
to spare, we walked out again, 
one in slacks and one in leathers. 

We still damped our mufflers 
— you never know who might be 
parked — but Ju threw her arms 
around me and kissed me on the 
open cheek. It made me feel 
pretty brave. Then she shooed 
me ahead. 

I mounted and rolled into the 
arena. A pro mechanic-doctor 
came with me and checked my 
stirrups and ejector and stuff, 
and said good luck, and stood 
back. I’d cut things close, to 
avoid idle chat. 



Then I really began to get 
Lepidoptera in the viscera. The 
far end looked five miles off with 
the stands curving around, and 
the enemy whippet toy-size — 
denture-pink and a red tornado 
on the panels. I’d watched out- 
side Slada’s house: She was mid- 
thirties but made up to look 
older, like mud on a moke’s wind- 
shield, as if she had more to hide 
than she really did. That kind’s 
always proving they’re just as 
good as ever, which is bad. An- 
other muscly dame. With swords 
or something, I might have felt 
different about fighting a woman. 
But this was like on the road 
where she’d ditch you to show 
her peerless skill. Maybe she was 
a moo-cow at home, but in a 
zoom her reality came out and 
you could drive her into a board 
with a hammer. So, I was going 
to do all I could to her — if any. 

At the pistol, I sure gave my 
pro a dust-bath. I wanted to get 
Slada off balance. She was just 
flipping a cigarette butt — the 
old Nonchalant Flair like she’d 
do whipping in and out of lanes 
with a kid doin’ Ben Hur on the 
seat beside her — when I was 
suddener than she’d expected. 
You know, when there’s a gap 
two cars could pass in at a hum- 
ble speed, and you just head for 
the middle? The other guy’ll con- 
cede! So did Slada, and nearly 
dumped swerving. And I cleared 



A DAY ON DEATH HIGHWAY 



137 



the end wall by about two feet, 
and her pro jumped. 

Well, she was madded up at 
being bluffed by any Young Gerl, 
and began to show her old-hand 
knowhow, to restore her confi- 
dence. She’d wear me (Judy) 
down till she could lay my 
(Judy’s) face open good. (And it 
could have been Judy.) And she 
sure played rough. 

I could read her far 
^ enough ahead to hold her 
off. And all the time, something 
was building up in me like those 
Civil War radio tubes that took 
hours to get hot. This stuff was 
great for guys like Pop. (Zowrrr, 
whacko.) Put ’em in here and 
let ’em slug it out. (Here she 
comes.) Or for old-time Indians 
and Vikings who’d kill anybody 
for kicks, including themselves. 
(Zgrrrrunch, whack-crack.) But 
when those types got too gay, 
people just abolished them. 
(Now what . .?) So why should 
Judy get her arm crippled or her 
face ground in the sand? 
(Whoooom, oofie.) Or even me, 
dammit? 

I’d planned just to steer and 
try to bull through. But sudden- 
ly it burst on me: In three min- 
utes, she hadn’t nearly touched 
me; and when I’d bluffed her at 
the start, she’d crumpled. 
(Watchit!) And why could I 
read her? (Vrooom, missed a- 

138 



gain.) ’Cause I could read Earth 
traffic, see? (No ya don’t, sister.) 
These jokers trained for scientific 
hell. (Zwoooo, Brrrotherrr.) But 
I’d been trained dirty. 

I wasn’t so proud of it now. 
But this was the time for it if 
ever. (Grrrrup.) Show ’em how 
to really play Russian roulette, 
and if a dumb little punk like 
me was champ at it, where was 
the Glory? 

So when she slowed on a turn, 
I timed her to a hair, zoom across 
her bumper (like beating the 
cross-traffic on a red). I’d have 
cut her too but she braked so 
hard she nearly went over her 
wheel and I only clunked her 
ka-whack across the helmet. But 
it sure shook her nerve again, 
and I got on her tail like a moke 
who can’t decide to pass, and 
began clouting her, thunk, whap. 
Not sportin’? Who cared! To cut 
her cheek, I’d have had to pull 
level; but a whip stings and 
bruises even through leather. And 
I just glorified! I couldn’t hate 
my own Pop, but I sure hated 
her. Show the kids how, huh? 

Then I gave her the Tech- 
nique. Foo! Any Grampaw driv- 
ing to work with his mind on his 
dyspepsia, can do it by force of 
habit to score three car-lengths 
per block. She suddenly slowed 
to force me ahead, and I surged 
and cut in front of her, like beat- 
ing a guy to a red light, and 

GALAXY 



braked so she had to swing to 
pass me, and I clunked her. I 
snake-hipped her both sides. I 
crowded her from behind and 
when she swung away, there I 
was crowding her on the other 
side. It’s amazing how much su- 
premacy you can jam into a few 
minutes. 

Only I forgot she wasn’t a 
Regular or even a good old Earth 
moke. And sometimes these 
Jehuans go even Earth one bet- 
ter, when they’re losing a fight, 
and do a kamikaze crash. So 
when she threw her whip away 
and opened her whippet out full, 
which is dangerous, I was too 
terrified to be scared. Geez guys! 
Those last two minutes were the 
longest hour I ever lived. We 
covered a good two miles in tight 
loops, I swear. Then, twenty sec- 
onds to go, she swung too tight, 
that gooey pink thing toppled, 
and the ejector threw her, all in 
one gasp. No time to brake. Left, 
right — I could just feel that 
I’d hit her whippet and crash; 
soft bump and snapping bones. 
I went between with my head 
and eyes scronched down. 

I near rammed the wall before 
I realized neither crash nor bump 
had happened. 

Marshals came tearing out, 
zrowww. But Slada was already 
rolling over. My muscles sort of 
melted: For once I’d gotten a 
closeup of how it’d feel to Get 



It — or Give It. But I hung on 
and drove slow to Defenders’ 
End, just as the gate went up. 

SOMEHOW, I’d never figured 
how to get out of that jam. 
People were helping me down, 
patting my back, pulling at my 
helmet. I bolted for the only pos- 
sible cover, that Ladies’ Dressing 
Room. I expected a riot, but no- 
body realized I was a Him. And 
in my state of mind, the scenery 
didn’t matter. Then Mom 
grabbed me: “Darling! You’re all 
right?” and started on the hel- 
met. I had to bolt again, for the 
cubicle she’d come out of. 

But she caught on fast, and I 
got another high-octane kiss all 
in the family. Hot coffee too. But 
she kept saying, “Now, from now 
on, Judy — I mean Chuck — no 
more of your father’s nonsense. 
Now promise!” 

Well, all I wanted was to sit 
with my hands between my 
knees, but finally I hove up: 
“Look, Mom, I don’t need to 
promise. I’m sick of the adept 
stuff. Judy’ll promise anything 
right now, but she’ll get yippee- 
pills in her tank again because 
she’s a born show-off. And as for 
Pop ...” I just shrugged. 

“Well, if your father isn’t im- 
pressed now . .” 

I said, “Mom, the only cure 
for Pop is breaking his back or 
going where he can’t drive.” 

139 



A DAY ON DEATH HIGHWAY 



. L 




“Well, Chuckle, I did check, 
and there’s a place called Bolg- 
walk where Plutomat wants a 
man, and they have no roads to 
speak of, just bogs.” 

Well, we both knew Pop’d nev- 
er ride in any such back seat. 

Just then, Judy burst in. She’d 
gotten by as “Miss Blaire’s Sis- 
ter”. And as we switched clothes 
again, she reported that the fight 
had been a sensation. (She’d 
watched, though Mom wouldn’t.) 
Half the audience was wild over 
the greatest daredevil show in 
history, and half was honking 
mad at my unsporting tactics and 



wanted Slada to rechallenge. (I 
bet!) Nuts and bolts to both, 
halves. 

Outside, Mom gave the old el- 
bow to a mob of reporters: 
“Stand back, there. The girl’s ex- 
hausted. You can call tomorrow.” 

And there, at the whippet, was 
Pop. All month he’d been sulking 
as if the whole deal were a plot 
to cramp his style. But now he 
had that quirk smirk like the guy 
in the ad: “Drive cautiously with 
our Triple-Threat Modem Storm- 
Trooperol.” 

The newshounds popped some 
bulbs, and he said, “Okay, keeds. 



you whisk along. I’ll handle this.” 
Mom walked at him. “You’ll 
handle nothing. Get along to the 
car.” 

He tempered: “What’s this? I 
thought we’d celebrate for my 
famous daughter. So . you go 
home in an armored car if you 
like. Come on, Judy, you’re a 
sport anyway. You and me, hey?” 
But Ju was still scared, even 
if it was wearing off, and said 
“No!” in that spoiled-brat voice 
he always thought was so cute. 

He sneered like when some 
moke elbows him in traffic, and 
^wung away, beat us out to Spec- 



tator Parking, legged into the 
car like forking over his cayuse, 
whammed the door and roared 
the engine, all in one snappy ac- 
tion. He shot out of his stall with 
one deft whirl of the wheel, fix- 
ing to surge straight ahead out 
of the lot. 

Maybe if he hadn’t been so 
mad, even he would have seen 
the other car. But he felt it first, 
a crash that knocked his hat off. 
He and the other guy, with a 
passenger, charged out to inspect 
the slaughter. 

Stumblebum had taken it on 
the rear bumper, but the side of 
the other looked like a discarded 
candy-wrapper. Well . Pop had 
hit him. The only good feature 
was that the other guy, though 
big, was gray-haired with a high 
complexion. Pop saw it too and, 
after they’d all asked couldn’t 
they look where they were going, 
he began the old Road Lawyer 
line: “Well, now. Mister, this isn’t 
an open street, y’know. How’m I 
to back blind with you crashing 
through full speed?” 

The old guy went turkey-red; 
“Why, look where you hit me! 
I was half way past you, sir.” 

“All right. Challenge if you 
like. My little girl just made a 
monkey of a better fighter than 
you’re likely to be.” 

The old guy went beet-red. On 
Jehu, if an old guy doesn’t want 
to fight, he better drive real hum- 



140 



GALAXY

ble. His jaw stuttered, then he 
grabbed for his fender, and 
slumped to the ground, and lay 
there grunting and not even pink. 

A doc jumped to him. But the 
old guy’s passenger grabbed Pop 
and jerked him around. He 
looked like a lumberjack fore- 
man, curly black hair, black- 
shaved chin, hot black eyes. He 
snarled, “So now I flay you on 
behalf of my father, bigmouth,” 

Pop cased the gU 5 r’s horse- 
power, and suddenly he looked 
all flabby. He did wrench his 
shoulder loose and try the hard- 
boiled comeback: “If your father 
can’t keep his temper, 7’m not 
liable by your code.” (Like he 
says, what can you lose? And 
you often win.) 

The guy pushed his face an 
inch from Pop’s: “Code? Why 
you hog-trough oaf, twenty wit- 
nesses heard you insult him in a 
discussion of honor. They will 
strip your back and I, Slam Hol- 
licker, will hack it to the bones. 
If you ever drive again, you will 
defer even to old men.” He swung 
away without even bowing. 

Pop was pinned there till they 
got old Hollicker into an ambu- 
lance and towed away his car. 
Then, Mom got in the driver’s 
seat of our car, and Pop got in 
beside her without a peep, and 
Judy in the back. So I went for 
the whippet. It sure looks like 
we’ll need that 



Planet Bolgwalk 
Dec. 3, 1987. 

i^NLY we didn’t do anything 
of the kind. 

I didn’t even pump Judy on 
what happened on that drive 
home; you owe your father some 
fenders to hide behind. But when 
I came in. Mom said, “Chuck, 
your father has taken a new job 
and we’re translating again the 
day after tomorrow.” So I went 
to borrow back some stuff and 
see some guys, but wondering 
why the overdrive. 

Till I saw Pop. He’d been figur- 
ing the percentages. 

Next day he was clearing up 
at his office. But he was home 
early fussing around like a pup 
in traffic, till the frame-building 
crew told him to go find a park- 
ing-deck. Then indoors, making 
sure nobody’d forgotten ansrthing 
to hold us up come morning. 
Then out trying to bribe the 
crew to work overtime. Then, 
when they said the inspector 
wouldn’t clear it till morning 
an 3 Tway, phoning the inspector to 
bribe him. Honest, I thought he’d 
boil his rad. 

The old impetuous spirit got 
him down at crack of dawn, too, 
burning toast and eggs till Mom 
took the kitchen away from him. 
Which gained us three hours to 
stall around in while the crew 
finished the fence under his 
steely eye — though he didn’t 



know any more about it than he 
does about a carburetor. But at 
half an hour to zero, Mr. Glash 
arrived and Pop got onto his rear 
bumper. They were out by the 
fence and Pop giving with the 
old Twenty Questions — why 
this, why that, with no break for 
answers — when up pranced this 
guy in a blue-and-white rig and 
hollered Pop’s name aloud. 

Pop winced. “Hey, tone it 
down. I can hear you. What’s all 
this?” 

The guy began reading a 
paper which boiled down to a 
demand that Pop desist from 
running out on his honorable 
duel. Pop looked like one of 
these guys who, when they get 
in a crash, jump out of the car 
and run. He grabbed Glash. 
“Hey, this clown can’t stop me 
moving, can he?” 

Glash drawled, “This ‘clown’ is 
Herald of the Courts of Honor. 
But, no, he can’t stop your mov- 
ing, as long as it’s off Jehu.” 

Pop reinflated slightly. ‘Well, 
not that I want to welsh on an 
obligation. But Mrs. Blaire was 
so upset about the girl, and I had 
this offer. And you know how it 
is with big deals — split-second 
decisions.” 

Glash fluttered his eyelids. 
“Oh, yes, everyone knows. And 
as long as Hollicker feels he’s 
run you off Jehu he’ll be satis- 
fied. But don’t come back, even 



for a day for your firm, say. Not 
healthy.” 

The inspector arriving at last 
saved Pop answering that one. 

Glash bowed with flourishes to 
Mom and Judy, and slightly to 
Pop. He drawled, “It’s been, ah, 
interesting to know you, as a 
specimen of the, ah, Earth Regu- 
lars. I trust you find Bolgwalk 
congenial.” 

Then suddenly he turned to 
me. “From what I hear through, 
ah, a contact at the Arena, you’ll 
make a man yet, Charles. Get 
some education — and get rid of 
the one you have. Good luck.” 

So we shook hands. Man! 

But who saw through my 
game and didn’t squeal? 

T^UNNY how Pop’s adjusted to 
Bolgwalk; he fulfills his bull- 
man ego by betting on the plane- 
tary whiffle-ball games. He usu- 
ally loses but it’s comparatively 
cheap. Judy could be on an aster- 
oid, for all she cares now, if it 
had boys on it. No cars — but 
they make out. Mom treats me 
real man-to-man. 

But now I’ve gotten over be- 
ing a professional teener, I think 
I’ll take Mr. Glash’s advice. 
They say the High Vacuum 
Navy gives you wonderful train- 
ing. And you can take chances in 
the line of duty . without 
scooping in civilians.

CUGARDALE THREE miles, 
^ the state highway sign said. 
Dexter Foote turned into the 
side road that the arrow indi- 
cated. 

He had no way of knowing it 
at the time, but by his action he 
condemned his new convertible 
to a fate worse than death. 

The side road meandered 
down a long slope into a wooded 
hollow where a breeze born of 
cool bowers and shaded brooks 
made the July afternoon heat 
less oppressive. A quantity of the 
pique that had been with him 
ever since setting forth from the 
city departed. There were worse 
assignments, after all, than writ- 
ing up a fallen star. 

Abruptly he applied the brakes 
and brought the convertible to a 
screeching halt. His blue eyes 
started from his boyish face. 

Well they might. The two 
Humpty Dumptyish creatures 
squatting in the middle of the 
road were as big as heavy tanks 
and, judging from their “skin 
tone,” were constructed of similar 
material. They had arms like 
jointed cranes and legs like artic- 
ulated girders. Their scissors-like 
mouths were slightly open, ex- 
posing maws the hue of an open 
hearth at tapping time. Either 
they were all body and no head, 
or all head and no body. Which- 
ever was the case, they had both 
eyes and ears. The former had 



SWEET TOOTH 



145 




something of the aspect of peek 
holes in a furnace door, while the 
latter brought to mind lopsided 
TV antennae. 

As Dexter watched, the fore- 
most of the two metallic mon- 
sters advanced upon the convert- 
ible and began licking the 
chrome off the grill with a long, 
tong-like tongue. Meanwhile, its 
companion circled to the rear 
and took a big bite out of the 
trunk. There was an awesome 
CRUNCH! and the convertible 
gave a convulsive shudder. 

At this point, Dexter got out 
and ran. More accurately, he 
jumped out and ran. A hundred 
feet down the road, he stopped 
and turned. He was just in time 
to see monster No. 1 bite off the 
right headlight. CRUNCH! Not 
to be outdone, monster No. 2 bit 
off the right taillight. CRUNCH- 
CRUNCH! An acrid odor af- 
fronted Dexter’s nostrils, and he 
discerned a faint yellow haze 
hovering about the convertible. 
The rear wheels went in two 
bites. The 250 HP. motor re- 
quired three. CRUNCH- 
CRUNCH-CRUNCH! The up- 
holstery caught fire and began 
to bum. A gout of flame shot up 
as the gas tank exploded. Far 
from discouraging the two mon- 
sters, the resultant inferno mere- 
ly served to whet their appetities. 
CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH- 
CRUNCH! 

146 



Dexter’s shoulders sagged, and 
the spot next to his heart that the 
convertible had shared with his 
best girl gave a spasmodic 
twinge. Removing his suitcoat 
and slinging it over his shoulder, 
he turned his back on the grisly 
repast and set out sadly for 
Sugardale. 

He had not gone far before his 
stalled thought-processes got into 
gear again. 

rriHE FALLING star he had 
been assigned by his editor 
to write up had been an unusu- 
ally brilliant one according to the 
report the paper had received. 
Maybe its unusualness did not 
stop there. Maybe it was some- 
thing more than a mere meteor- 
ite. Certainly the two monsters 
could not be classified as local 
woodland creatures. 

All of which was fine as far as 
copy was concerned. But it didn’t 
bring his convertible back. 

Presently he saw two sizable 
deposits of slag at the side of the 
road, and approaching them 
more closely, he discovered that 
they were still warm. Could they 
be the remains of a previously 
devoured automobile? he won- 
dered. What an ignominious fate 
indeed to overtake a car! He 
looked at the two deposits once 
more before moving on. All he 
could think of were two piles of 
elephant dung.

A mile and half later, he 
emerged in a small valley that 
sported a handful of houses, a 
scattering of business places, a 
church or two and a goodly num- 
ber of trees. A roadside sign in- 
formed him that he had reached 
his destination, that its popula- 
tion was 350, and that its speed 
limit was 20 mph. The popula- 
tion, however, was nowhere in 
evidence, and the speed limit 
seemed silly in view of the ab- 
sence of cars. 

A scared-looking housewife, 
upon whose door he knocked, 
told him he’d probably find the 
local minion of the law at the 
Sugardale Inn, “sucking up beer 
the way he always is when he 
should be out earning his mon- 
ey.” The Inn turned out to be a 
sagging three-story structure in 
desperate need of a paint-job. 
There was a model A sedan 
parked in front of it, the first 
automobile Dexter had seen. 
Formerly the establishment had 
provided a haven for weary 
travelers. Now it provided a 
haven for contented cockroaches. 
Its fin de siecle bar was a col- 
lector’s item, and standing at it, 
one foot propped on the brass 
barrail, was a lone customer. He 
was tall and thin, and somewhere 
in his sixties, and he was wear- 
ing blue denim trousers and a 
blue chambray shirt There was 
a lackluster badge pinned on the 



fading shirtfront, and a beat-up 
sombrero sat atop the graying 
head. 

“Sheriff Jeremiah Smith at 
your service,” he said calmly 
when Dexter dashed up to him. 
He took a sip from the schooner 
of beer that sat on the bar before 
him. “Got troubles, have you, 
young man?” 

“My car,” Dexter said. “I was 
driving along the road and — ” 

“Got ate up, did it? Well, it’s 
not the first one to get ate up 
around here.” Jeremiah Smith 
faced the doorway that led to the 
lobby. “Mrs. Creasy, get this 
young man a beer,” he called. 

A plump middle-aged woman 
whose dark hair fell down over 
her eyes like a thicket came 
into sight behind the bar. She 
flicked a cockroach off the drain- 
board with an expert forefinger, 
drew Dexter a schooner and set 
it before him. Jeremiah Smith 
paid for it. “Drink her down, 
young man,” he said. “I know 
how I’d feel if my car got ate up.” 

Manfully, Dexter dispatched 
half the contents of the schooner, 
after which he introduced him- 
self and explained the nature of 
his mission to Sugardale. “I nev- 
er figured on an 3 dhing like this, 
though,” he concluded. 

“You must have made it 
through just before the road- 
block was set up,” Jeremiah said. 
“You were lucky.”

Dexter started at him. “Lucky! 
I lost my car.” 

“Pshaw. What’s a car to a 
newspaper man when a Big 
Story’s in the air? Take this 
newspaper fellow I saw on TV 
Saturday night. He — ’’ 

“Big Stories went out long 
ago,” Dexter said. “Newspaper- 
men work for a living the same 
as anybody else. Get back to my 
car. Aren’t you going to do any- 
thing about it?” 

Jeremiah looked hurt. “I’ve al- 
ready done everything I can do. 
The minute I saw those tanks I 
knew it was a job for the army, 
and the state police agreed with 
me. So we notified them, after 
which we advised everybody to 
stay indoors and to keep their 
cars under lock and key. All we 
can do now is wait.” Jeremiah 
sighed. “Crazy, if you ask me.

“I 


imagine,” Dexter 


said 


thoughtfully. 


“that our 


diet 


would 


give 


them pause 


too. 


Where 


did this star of 


yours 



fall?” , 

“In Ed Hallam’s north timber 
lot. Take you there, if you like. 
There’s not much to see, though 
— just a big hole in the ground.” 
Dexter finished his beer. “Come 
on,” he said. 

'T’HE MOriEL A parked in 
front of the Inn turned out 
to be Jeremiah’s. They took off 



down the road at a brisk pace, 
wound through woods, dales, pas- 
tures and fields. Dexter hadn’t 
the remotest idea where he was 
when at last Jeremiah pulled up 
beside a grove larger and darker 
than the others. 

The old man squinted into the 
lengthening shadows. “Seems to 
me them auto-eating tanks ought 
to make better reading than a 
common ordinary falling star.” 

Halfway out of the car, Dexter 
stared at him. “You mean to tell 
me you don’t see the connec- 
tion?” 

“What connection?” 

Dexter got the rest of the way 
out. “Between the automobile- 
eaters and the spaceship, of 
course.” 

Jeremiah stared at him. “What 
spaceship?” 

“Oh, never mind,” Dexter said. 
“Show me the fallen star.” 

It was in a clearing deep in the 
woods. Or rather, the crater-like 
hole it had made was. Peering 
down into the hole, Dexter saw 
the dark, pitted surface of what 
could very well have been an or- 
dinary, if unusually large, mete- 
orite. There was nothing that 
suggested an opening of any 
kind, but the opposite wall of the 
crater did look as though some 
heavy object had been dragged 
— or had dragged itself — up to 
the level of the clearing. The 
underbrush showed signs of hav- 



148 



GALAXY 



ing been badly trampled in the 
recent past. 

He pointed out the signs to 
Jeremiah. “See how those sap- 
lings are flattened? No human 
being did that. I’ll bet if we fol- 
lowed that trail, we’d come to the 
remains of the first car they con- 
sumed. Whose car was it, by the 
way?” 

“Mrs. Hopkins’s new Buick. 
She’d just started out for the city 
on one of her shopping trips. She 
was so scared when she came 
running back into town her hair 
was standing straight out behind 
her head. Maybe, though, it was 
because she was running so fast.” 
Abruptly Jeremiah leaned for- 
ward and squinted at the ground. 
“Looks almost like a big foot- 
print right there, don’t it.” He 
straightened. “But if the darn 
thing is a spaceship like you say, 
how come it buried itself?” 

“Because whoever or whatever 
was piloting it didn’t — or could- 
n’t — decelerate enough for an 
orthodox landing,” Dexter ex- 
plained. “Lucky it hit the clear- 
ing. If it had hit the trees, you’d 
have had a forest fire on your 
hands.” 

Jeremiah looked worried. 
“Maybe we’d better be getting 
back to the road. I feel kind of 
guilty leaving my model A sit- 
ting there all alone.” 

Dexter followed him back 
through the woods and climbed 



into the front seat beside him. 
The road took them to the main 
highway, and not long thereafter 
Jeremiah turned off the highway 
into another road — a familiar 
road heralded by a familiar sign 
that said, SUGARDALE THREE 
MILES. Two slag deposits 
marked the spot where once 
Dexter’s proud convertible had 
stood. He gazed at them sadly 
as they passed. 

SUDDENLY Jeremiah brought 
^ the model A to a screeching 
halt. The two desecrators of the 
American Dream Incarnate were 
in the midst of another repast. 
The victim this time, judging 
from the still-visible star and the 
O.D. color scheme, was an army 
staff car. The grill and the motor 
were already gone, and half of 
the roof was missing. Yellow 
haze enshrouded the sorry scene, 
and the countryside was resound- 
ing to a series of horrendous 
CRUNCHES. 

“Do you think if I sort of 
zoomed by, we could make it?” 
Jeremiah asked. “I hate to go all 
the way around the other way.” 

“I’m game if you are,” Dexter 
said. 

ZOOOOOOMMMMMMM! 

The two monsters didn’t even 
look up. 

“You’d think my model A 
wasn’t good enough for them,” 
Jeremiah said peevishly. 



SWEET TOOTH

“Count your blessings. Look, 
there’s someone up ahead.” 

The “someone” turned out to 
be a two-star general, a chicken 
colonel and an enlisted man. Jer- 
emiah stopped, and the trio 
climbed into the back seat. “Ate 
your staff car, did they. Gen- 
eral?” he chuckled, taking off 
again. “Well, that’s the way it 
goes.” 

“The name,” said the general, 
whose middleaged face had a 
greenish cast, “is General Long- 
combe, and I was on my way to 
Sugardale to reconnoiter the sit- 
uation before committing any 
troops to the area. This is my 
aide. Colonel Mortby, and my 
driver. Sergeant Wilkins.” 

“Sheriff Smith at your service,” 
said Jeremiah. “This here’s Dex- 
ter Foote, who came to Sugar- 
dale to do a Big Story on our 
falling star.” 

“Tell me about these VEMs of 
yours, sheriff,” General Long- 
combe said. 

Jeremiah twisted around. 
“VEMs?” 

“ ‘Vehicle-Eating Monsters’,” 
Colonel Mortby interposed. He 
was a small man with a pleasant 
youthful face. “It’s standard army 
operating procedure to give an 
object a name before investigat- 
ing it.” 

“Oh.” Jeremiah twisted back 
again, saved the model A from 
going into the ditch with a Her- 



culean yank on the wheel. “Well, 
Dexter here seems to think that 
our falling star is a spaceship and 
that they landed in it, and I’m 
inclined to believe he’s right.” 
“After seeing the VEMs in per- 
son, I’m inclined to believe he’s 
right myself,” Colonel Mortby 
said. “I think that what we have 
to do with here,” he went on pres- 
ently, when the general made no 
comment, “is a form of metal- 
based life capable of generating 
an internal temp)erature of at 
least three thousand degrees 
Fahrenheit. The acrid odor they 
give off while ‘feasting’ probably 
arises from a substance analo- 
gous to our gastric juices which 
their heat-resistant stomachs sup>- 
ply to accomplish ‘digestion,’ 
only in this case ‘digestion’ con- 
sists primarily in melting down 
the metal they consume and in 
isolating its waste matter, after 
which the pure metal is repro- 
cessed into ‘body tissue’ and the 
waste matter is thrown off in the 
form of slag. I think we might go 
so far as to call them a couple of 
animate open hearths.” 

Dexter had turned around in 
the front seat and was looking at 
the colonel admiringly. “I think 
you’ve hit the nail right on the 
head, sir,” he said. 

General Longcombe was scowl- 
ing. “We’re here to survey the 
situation. Colonel, not to jump to 
conclusions.” He addressed the 



150 



GALAXY 



back of Jeremiah’s weather- 
beaten neck. “I trust we’ll have 
no trouble finding suitable ac- 
commodations in Sugardale, 
sheriff.” 

“Mrs. Creasy’ll be glad to put 
you up at the Inn, if that’s what 
you mean,” Jeremiah said. 

M rs. creasy was more than 

glad. Indeed, from the way 
she looked at the two officers and 
the NCO through her thicket of 
hair, you would have thought 
they were the first roomers she’d 
had in months, discounting the 
cockroaches, of course. 

The general said petulantly, 
“Let’s get down to business. 
Colonel. I want an armored com- 
pany brought up immediately, 
and I want the fallen-star area 
put off limits at once. Have the 
sheriff show you where it is.” He 
turned to Sergeant Wilkins. “Ser- 
geant, get on the phone as soon 
as the colonel gets off it, and ar- 
range for my personal Cadillac 
to be delivered here first thing.” 
After phoning his paper, Dex- 
ter headed for the dining room 
and sat down beside General 
Longcombe. “Anything new on 
the VEMs, General?” he asked. 

General Longcombe sighed. 
There were shadows under his 
eyes, and his cheeks showed signs 
of saggihg. “They’re still in cir- 
culation. Scared the wits out of a 
couple of teenagers and ate their 



hot-rod. We’ve got them under 
constant surveillance, of course, 
and what with all the under- 
brush they trample it’s easy e- 
nough to track them. But we 
can’t stop them. They eat our 
gas grenades and our fragmenta- 
tion grenades, and they’re imper- 
vious to our tank killers and our 
antitank mines. A small A-bomb 
would take care of them nicely, 
but even assuming there’s an 
area around here large enough 
and isolated enough to permit us 
to use an A-bomb, there’s no way 
of herding them into it.” 

“It just so happens that there 
is such an area,” Jeremiah Smith 
said. “Tillson Valley — about ten 
miles south of here. You’d have 
to vacate Old Man Tillson, of 
course, but he’d be glad to go if 
you made it worth his while. He 
hasn’t grown a thing but weeds 
anyway since he got his pension. 
Just sits around all day and 
sucks up beer.” 

“But there’s still no way of get- 
ting the VEMs out there,” Gen- 
eral Longcombe objected. 

“Tell me, general,” Dexter said, 
“have they eaten any of your 
jeeps or trucks or personnel car- 
riers?” 

General Longcombe shook his 
head. “They’ve had plenty of op- 
portunity to, too.” 

“I have a theory,” Dexter said. 
The look that promptly settled 
on General Longcombe’s face 



SWEET TOOTH 



151 



made no bones about what he 
thought of presumptuous young 
reporters with theories. Colonel 
Mortby, however, was consider- 
ably less biased. “It won’t do any 
harm to listen to what he’s got 
to say, sir,” he pointed out, “and 
it may even do some good. It’ll 
be at least a day before the ship 
is excavated and even then we 
may not know any more about 
the sort of life forms we’re deal- 
ing with than we do now.” 

I^EXTER NEEDED no fur- 
ther invitation. “I think it’s 
pretty clear by now,” he began, 
“that our two visitors from Plan- 
et X aren’t attracted by metal in 
just any old form at all, but by 
metal in the form of new, or near- 
ly new, automobiles. This strong- 
ly suggests that their landing was 
unpremeditated, because if it had 
been premeditated they would 
have come down in a section of 
the country where such metallic 
concoctions are in plentiful sup- 
ply — near a city or a 'large 
town, or close to a heavily trav- 
eled throughway. 

“But what is it about these 
new cars of ours that they find 
so irresistible? Let’s try an anal- 
ogy. Suppose that one of us has 
gone into a bakery to buy a 
birthday cake and that money is 
no object. Which cake is he most 
likely to buy? The answer is ob- 
vious: the one with the most vis- 



ual appeal. To return to our 
visitors from Planet X. Suppose 
that all their lives they’ve been 
eating metal in various but unin- 
spired ingot forms — the metal- 
lic equivalents, let’s say, of beans 
and bread and hominy grits. Now 
suppose they find their way to 
another planet where visual ap- 
peal in metallic creation is a ma- 
jor occupation, and suppose that 
shortly after disembarking from 
their spaceship they come upon 
a new convertible. Wouldn’t they 
react in the same way we would 
react if all our lives our diet had 
been confined to beans and bread 
and hominy grits and we trav- 
eled to another planet, disem- 
barked and came upon a delicious 
birthday cake just begging to be 
eaten? Wouldn’t they make pigs 
of themselves and start looking 
for more cakes?” 

“But if it’s the ornate nature of 
our late-model cars that attracts 
them, why did they eat the staff 
car?” Colonel Mortby asked. 
“And why did they eat the teen- 
ager’s hot rod, and our gas and 
fragmentation grenades?” 

“I suggest,” Dexter said, “that 
they ate the staff car because at 
the moment there weren’t any 
other cars immediately available. 
As for the teenager’s hot rod, I 
imagine it was loaded down with 
enough chrome accessories to 
sink a battleship. And as for the 
grenades — your men threw 



152 



GALAXY 



them at them first, did they 
not?” 

Colonel Mortby nodded. “I see 
what you mean. Sort of like 
throwing candy to a baby. I’ll 
buy your theory, Mr. Foote.” 
“And now, if I may,” Dexter 
continued, “I’d like to propose a 
means of getting rid of our un- 
wanted visitors from Planet X.” 
General Longcombe sighed. 
“Very well, Mr. Foote. Go on.” 
“You mentioned earlier, sir, 
that there was no way of herding 
the VEMs into an isolated area. 
However, I think there is a way. 
Suppose we were to remove all 
of the automobiles from the vi- 
cinity with the exception of one, 
and suppose we were to park 
that one in the middle of Tillson 
Valley as bait, with a remote- 
controlled A-bomb underneath 
it?” 

“But how would they know 
that the bait was there?” 

“Through association,” Dexter 
said. “All of the automobiles 
they’ve consumed thus far were 
in operation shortly before they 
began to eat them, so by now 
they must have established an 
vmconscious relationship between 
the sound of the motors and the 
taste of the metal. Therefore, if 
we keep the bait idling and set 
up a P.A. system to amplify the 
sound, eventually they’ll hear it, 
their mouths will salivate and 
they’ll come running.” 



General Longcombe offered no 
comment. He app>eared to be 
deep in thought. 

“My car is in West Virginia,” 
Colonel Mortby said. 

“My car was eaten,” Dexter 
said. 

General Longcombe opened 
his mouth. “My car — ” he began. 

Sergeant Wilkins entered the 
room and saluted smartly. “The 
general’s Cadillac has just ar- 
rived, sir,” he said. 

I^LD MAN Tillson co-operated 
readily enough, once he was 
assured that he would be in- 
demnified not only for his ram- 
shackle house but for the young 
mountain of beer bottles that 
stood in his back yard, and the 
command post was moved forth- 
with to the lip of the valley. 
Jeremiah Smith was allowed to 
go along as an observer, and 
Dexter was accorded a similar 
favor. By evening, everything 
was in place. The colonel’s Cad- 
illac, parked in the valley’s cen- 
ter, had something of the aspect 
of a chrome-bedizened lamb rest- 
ing on an altar of crab grass, but- 
tercups and mustard weeds. Sur- 
rounding it were half a dozen 
floodlights, suspended over it was 
a microphone, standing next to 
it was a pole supporting three 
P.A. speakers, and located sev- 
eral hundred feet away was a 
TV camera. Beyond this imprqs- 



SWEET TOOTH 



153 



sive display, Old Man Tillson’s 
homestead could be discerned, 
and beyond the homestead rose 
his mountainous collection of 
beer bottles. 

Colonel Mortby came out of 
the command-post tent and 
walked over to where Dexter and 
Jeremiah were standing, looking 
down into the valley. He handed 
each of them a pair of cobalt- 
blue glasses. “If you watch the 
blast, make sure you wear these,” 
he said, raising his voice above 
the amplified purring of the Cad- 
illac’s motor. “You’ll be glad to 
hear that the two VEMs are al- 
ready on their way, Mr. Foote — 
our walkie-talkie squad just 
called in. However, the creatures 
move so slowly that they prob- 
ably won’t be here before dawn.” 

Dexter came out of a brown 
study. “One thing still bugs me,” 
he said. “Why should two mem- 
bers of a race of extraterrestrials 
technically intelligent enough to 
build spaceships behave like a 
pair of gluttonous savages the 
minute they land on another 
planet?” 

“But you explained that,” Jer- 
emiah pointed out. “They just 
can’t resist eating American au- 
tomobiles.” 

“I’m afraid I got carried away 
by my analogy. Civilized beings 
simply don’t go running across 
the countryside the minute they 
land, and start grabbing up ever- 



ything that strikes their eye. 
They make contact with the au- 
thorities first, and then they go 
running across the countryside 
and start grabbing up everyrthing 
that strikes their eye.” 

Colonel Mortby grinned. 
“You’ve got a good point there, 
Mr. Foote. Well, I’m going to see 
if I can’t grab forty winks or so 
— it’s been a trying day.” 

“Me too,” Jeremiah said, head- 
ing for his model A. 

Left alone, Dexter wedged a 
flashlight in the fork of a little 
tree, sat down in its dim radi- 
ance, got out pen and notebook, 
and began his article. The Solid 
Cheese Cadillac, he wrote, by 
Dexter Foote . 

Dawn found him dozing over 
page 16. “There they are!” some- 
one shouted, jerking him awake. 
“The filthy fiends!” 

The “someone” was General 
Longcombe. Joining him, Dexter 
saw the two VEMs. They were 
moving relentlessly across the 
valley floor toward the helpless 
Cadillac. Jeremiah came up, rub- 
ing his eyes. Colonel Mortby 
could be discerned through the 
entrance of the command-post 
tent, leaning over a technician’s 
shoulder. 

The two VEMs reached the 
Cadillac and began licking off the 
chrome with their long, tong-like 
tongues. General Longcombe 
went wild. He waved his arms. 



154 



GALAXY 



“Monsters!” he screamed, “I’ll 
blow you to Kingdom Come per- 
sonally!” and stomped into the 
tent. 

Dexter and Jeremiah started 
to put on their cobalt-blue glas- 
ses. Abruptly thunder sounded, 
and a shadow darkened the land. 
Looking skyward, Dexter saw 
it — 

The ship. The saucer. Which- 
ever word you cared to apply to 
it. But whichever noun you 
chose, you had to prefix it with 
the adjective “gigantic,” for the 
ventral hatch alone, which had 
just yawned open, was large e- 
nough to accommodate the 
Sugardale Methodist Church. 

In the command-post tent, the 
general, as yet unaware of the 
UFO’s presence, was giving the 
countdown in an anguished voice. 
“Two — ” 

In the valley, the two .VEMs 
were trying vainly to extricate 
themselves from a huge metallic 
net that had dropped over them. 

“One — ” 

On the lip of the valley, Dex- 
ter Foote was grappling with an 
insight. 

“Zero — ” 

Pfft! . 

6iTT WASN’T a dud after all,” 
General Longcombe said. 
“They cancelled out the chain- 



reaction with some kind of a 
ray. I wonder . .” He shook his 
head wistfully. “What a weapon, 
though.” 

He and Colonel Mortby and 
the tech were standing by the 
chrome-stripped carcass of the 
Cadillac. Dexter and Jeremiah 
had just come up. “My theory 
turned out to be a little bit off- 
center,” Dexter said. “You see, I 
overlooked the possibility that 
our children aren’t necessarily 
the only galactic small fry who 
run away from home and get 
themselves in Dutch. My birth- 
day-cake analogy still holds true, 
but I would have done better to 
have compared our late-model 
automobiles to appetizing candy 
bars, or Easter baskets filled with 
jelly beans and chocolate chick- 
ens.” 

The general regarded him 
blankly. “I’m afraid I don’t fol- 
low you at all, Mr. Foote.” 

“Did you ever turn a pair of 
hungry kids loose in a candy 
store, sir?” 

Understanding came into Gen- 
eral Longcombe’s eyes then, and 
he turned and gazed sadly at his 
chromeless Cadillac. “I wonder if 
they have castor oil on Planet 
X,” he said." 

“I bet they have its equiva- 
lent,” grinned Dexter Foote.

MED SHIP MAN 



By MURRAY LEINSTER 

Illustrated by ENSH 






^ALHOUN regarded the com- 
^ municator with something 
like exasperation as his taped 
voice repeated a standard ap- 
proach-call for the twentieth time. 
But no answer came, which had 
become irritating a long time ago. 
This was a new Med Service sec- 
tor for Calhoun. He’d been as- 
signed to another man’s tour of 
duty because the other man had 
been taken down with romance. 
He’d gotten married, which ruled 
him out for Med Ship duty. So 
now Calhoun listened to his own 
voice endlessly repeating a call 
that should have been answered 
immediately. 

Murgatroyd the tormal 
watched with beady, interested 
eyes. The planet Maya lay off to 
port of the Med Ship Esclipus 
Twenty. Its almost circular disk 
showed full size on a vision screen 
beside the ship’s control board. 
The image was absolutely clear 
and vividly colored. There was an 
ice cap in view. There were conti- 
nents. There were seas. The cloud 
system of a considerable cyclonic 
disturbance could be noted off at 
one side, and the continents 
looked reasonably as they should, 
and the seas were of that muddy, 
indescribable tint which indicates 
deep water. 

Calhoun’s o\yn voice, taped an 
hour earlier, sounded in a speaker 



156 



GALAXY 



MED SHIP MAN 



157 



as it went again to the communi- 
cator and then to the extremely 
visible world a hundred thousand 
miles away. 

“Calling ground,” said Cal- 
houn’s recorded voice. “Med Ship 
Esclipus Twenty calling ground 
to report arrival and ask coordi- 
nates for landing. Our mass is 
fifty standard tons. Repeat, five- 
oh tons. Purpose of landing, 
planetary health inspection.” 

^1 ■'HE recorded voice stopp>ed. 

There was silence except for 
the taped random noises which 
kept the inside of the ship from 
feeling like the inside of a tomb. 

Murgatroyd said: “Chee?” 

Calhoun said ironically, “Un- 
doubtedly, Murgatroyd. Un- 
doubtedly! Whoever’s on duty at 
the spaceport stepped out for a 
moment, or dropped dead, or did 
something equally inconvenient. 
We have to wait until he gets 
back or somebody else takes 
over.” 

Murgatroyd said “Chee!” again 
and began to lick his whiskers. He 
knew that when Calhoun called 
on the communicator, another 
human voice should reply. Then 
there should be conversation, and 
shortly the force-fields of a land- 
ing-grid should take hold of the 
Med Ship and draw it planet- 
ward. In time it ought to touch 
ground in a spaceport with a gi- 
gantic, silvery landing-grid rising 



skyward all about it. Then there 
should be people greeting Cal- 
houn cordially and welcoming 
Murgatroyd with smiles and pet- 
ting. 

“Calling ground,” said the re- 
corded voice yet again. “Med 
Ship Esclipus Twenty — ” 

It went on through the formal 
notice of arrival. Murgatroyd 
waited in pleasurable anticipa- 
tion. When the Med Ship arrived 
at a port of call humans gave him 
sweets and cakes, and they 
thought it charming that he drank 
coffee just like a human, only 
with more gusto. Aground, Mur- 
gatroyd moved zestfully in soci- 
ety while Calhoun worked. Cal- 
houn’s work was conferences with 
planetary health officials, politely 
receiving such information as 
they thought important, and tact- 
fully telling them about the most 
recent developments in medical 
science as known to the Interstel- 
lar Medical Service. 

“Somebody,” said Calhoun 
darkly, “is going to catch the 
devil for this!” 

The communicator loudspeak- 
er spoke abruptly. 

“Calling Med Ship,” said a 
voice. “Calling Med Ship Esclipus 
T wenty! Liner Candida calling. 
Have you had an answer from 
ground?” 

Calhoun blinked. Then he said 
curtly; 

“Not yet. I’ve been calling all 



158 



GALAXY 



of half an hour, and never a word 
out of them!” 

“We’ve been in orbit twelve 
hours,” said the voice from empti- 
ness. “Calling all the while. No 
answer. We don’t like it.” 

Calhoun flipped a switch that 
threw a vision screen into circuit 
with the ship’s electron telescop>e. 
A starfield appeared and shifted 
wildly. Then a bright dot cen- 
tered itself. He raised the magni- 
fication. The bright dot swelled 
and became a chubby commer- 
cial ship, with the false ports that 
passengers like to believe they 
looked through when in space. 
Two relatively large cargo ports 
on each side showed that it car- 
ried heavy freight in addition to 
passengers. It was one of those 
workhorse intra-cluster ships that 
distributed the freight and pas- 
sengers the long-haul liners 
dumped off only at established 
transshipping ports. 

Murgatroyd padded across the 
Med Ship’s cabin and examined 
the image with a fine air of wis- 
dom. It did not mean anything to 
him, but tormals imitate human 
actions as parrots and parrakeets 
imitate human speech. He said, 
“Chee.’” as if making an observa- 
tion of profound significance, then 
went back to the cushion and 
again curled up. 

“We don’t see anything wrong 
aground,” the liner’s voice com- 
plained, “but they don’t answer 

MED SHIP MAN 



calls! We don’t get any scatter- 
signals either. We went down to 
two diameters and couldn’t pick 
up a thing. And we have a pas- 
senger to land. He insists on it!” 

"OY ordinary, communications 
between different places on a 
planet’s surface use frequencies 
the ion-layers of the atmosphere 
either reflect or refract down past 
the horizon. But there is usually 
some small leakage to space, and 
line-of-sight frequencies are gen- 
erally abundant. It is one of the 
annoyances of a ship coming in 
to port that space near most 
planets is usually full of local 
signals. 

“I’ll check,” said Calhoun curt- 
ly. “Stand by.” 

The Candida would have ar- 
rived off Maya as the Med Ship 
had done, and called down as Cal- 
houn had been doing. It was very 
probably a ship on schedule and 
the grid operator at the spaceport 
should have expected it. Space 
commerce was important to any 
planet, comparing more or less 
with the export-import business 
of an industrial nation in ancient 
times on Earth. Planets had elab- 
orate traffic-aid systems for the 
cargo-carriers which moved be- 
tween solar systems as they’d 
once moved between continents 
on Earth. Such traffic aids were 
very carefully maintained. Cer- 
tainly for a spaceport landing- 



159 



grid not to respond to calls for 
twelve hours running seemed 
ominous. 

“We’ve been wondering,” said 
the Candida querulously, “if there 
could be something radically 
wrong below. Sickness, for ex- 
ample.” 

The word “sickness” was a sub- 
stitute for a more alarming word. 
But a plague had nearly wiped 
out the population of Dorset, 
once upon a time, and the first 
ships to arrive after it had broken 
out most incautiously went down 
to ground, and so carried the 
plague to their next two ports of 
call. Nowadays quarantine regu- 
lations were enforced very strict- 
ly indeed. 

“I’ll try to find out what’s the 
matter,” said Calhoun. 

‘We’ve got a passenger,” re- 
peated the Candida aggrievedly, 
“who insists that we land him by 
space-boat if we don’t make a 
ship landing. He says he has im- 
p)ortant business aground.” 

Calhoun did not answer. The 
rights of passengers were extrava- 
gantly protected, these days. To 
fail to deliver a passenger to his 
destination entitled him to puni- 
tive damages which no spaceline 
could afford. So the Med Ship 
would seem heaven-sent to the 
Candida’s skipper. Calhoun could 
relieve him of responsibility. 

The telescope screen winked 
and showed the surface of the 



planet a hundred thousand miles 
away. Calhoun glared at the 
image on the port screen and 
guided the telescope to the space- 
port city — Maya City. He saw 
highways and blocks of buildings. 
He saw the spaceport and its 
landing-grid. He could see no 
motion, of course. 

He raised the magnification. 
He raised it again. Still no mo- 
tion. He upped the magnification 
until the lattice-pattern of the 
telescope’s amplifying crystal be- 
gan to show. But at the ship’s 
distance from the planet, a 
ground-car would represent only 
the fortieth of a second of arc. 
There was atmosphere, too, with 
thermals; anything the size of a 
ground-car simply couldn’t be 
seen. 

But the city showed quite 
clearly. Nothing massive had hap- 
pened to it. No large-scale physi- 
cal disaster had occurred. It sim- 
ply did not answer calls from 
space. 

ALHOUN FLIPPED off the 
screen. 

“I think,” he said irritably into 
the communicator microphone, 
“I suspect I’ll have to make an 
emergency landing. It could be 
something as trivial as a power 
failure — ” but he knew that was 
wildly improbable — “or it could 
be — anything. I’ll land on rock- 
ets and tell you what I find.”

The voice from the Candida 
said hopefully: 

“Can you authorize us to re- 
fuse to land our passenger for his 
own protection? He’s raising the 
devil! He insists that his business 
demands that he be landed.” 

A word from Calhoun as a Med 
Service man would protect the 
spaceliner from a claim for dam- 
ages. But Calhoun didn’t like the 
look of things. He realized, dis- 
tastefully, that he might find 
practically anything down below. 
He might find that he had to 
quarantine the planet and him- 
self with it. In such a case he’d 
need the Candida to carry word 
of the quarantine to other planets 
and thus to Med Service sector 
headquarters. 

“We’ve lost a lot of time,” in- 
sisted the Candida. “Can you 
authorize us — ” 

“Not yet,” said Calhoun. “I’ll 
tell you when I land.” 

“But — ” 

“I’m signing off for the mo- 
ment,” said Calhoun. “Stand by.” 
He headed the little ship down- 
ward, and as it gathered velocity 
he went over the briefing sheets 
covering this particular world. 
He’d never touched ground here 
before. His occupation, of course, 
was seeing to the dissemination 
of medical science as it developed 
under the Med Service. The Ser- 
vice itself was neither political 
nor administrative. But it was im- 



portant. Every human-occupied 
world was supposed to have a 
Med Ship visit at least once in 
four years to verify the state of 
public health. 

Med Ship men like Calhoun 
offered advice on public-health 
problems. When something out of 
the ordinary turned up, the Med 
Service had a staff of researchers 
who hadn’t been wholly baffled 
yet. There were great ships which 
could carry the ultimate in labo- 
ratory equipment and specialized 
personnel to any place where 
they were needed. Not less than 
a dozen inhabited worlds in this 
sector alone owed the survival of 
their populations to the Med Ser- 
vice, and the number of those 
which couldn’t have been colo- 
nized without Med Service help 
was legion. 

Calhoun reread the briefing. 
Maya was one of four planets in 
this general area whose life sys- 
tems seemed to have had a com- 
mon origin, suggesting that the 
Arrhenius theory of space-travel- 
ing spores was true in some 
limited sense. A genus of ground- 
cover plants with motile stems 
and leaves and cannibalistic ten- 
dencies was considered strong 
evidence of common origin. 

The planet had been colonized 
for two centuries now, and pro- 
duced organic compounds of 
great value from indigenous 
plants, most of which were used 



MED SHIP MAN 



161

in textile manufacture. There 
were no local endemic infections 
to which men were susceptible. 
A number of human-use crops 
were grown. Cereals, grasses and 
grains, however, could not be 
grown because of the native 
ground-cover motile-stem plants. 
All wheat and cereal food had to 
be imported, which fact severely 
limited Maya’s population. There 
were about two million people on 
the planet, settled on a peninsula 
in the Yucatan Sea and a small 
area of mainland. Public-health 
surveys had shown a great many 
things about a great many sub- 
jects . but there was no men- 
tion of anything to account for 
the failure of the spaceport to 
respond to arrival calls from 
space. Naturally! 

The Med Ship drove on down, 
and the planet revolved beneath 
it. 

As Maya’s sunlit hemisphere 
enlarged, Calhoun kept the tele- 
scope’s field wide. He saw cities, 
and vast areas of cleared land 
where native plants were grown 
as raw materials for the organics’ 
manufacturies. He saw very little 
true chlorophyll green, though. 
Mayan foliage tended to a dark 
olive color. 

A T FIFTY miles he was sure 
that the city streets were 
empty even of ground-car traffic. 
There was no spaceship aground 

162 



in the landing-grid. There were ^ 
no ground-cars in motion on the ^ 
splendid, multiple-lane highways. 

At thirty miles altitude there 
were still no signals in the atmo- i 
sphere, though when he tried * 
amplitude-modulation reception 1 
he picked up static. But there I 
was no normally modulated sig- I 
nal on the air at any frequency, f 
At twenty miles — no. At fifteen I 
miles, broadcast power was avail- 
able, which proved that the land- Ij 
ing-grid was working as usual, I 
tapping the upper atmosphere for 
electric charges to furnish power 
for all the planet’s needs. j 

From ten miles down to I 
ground-touch, Calhoun was busy. ^ 
It is not too difficult to land • 
a ship on rockets, with reason- i 
ably level ground to land on. But 1 
landing at a specific spot is some- i 
thing else. Calhoun juggled the 
ship to descend inside the grid , 
itself. His rockets burned out pen- j 
cil-thin holes through the clay ; 
and stone beneath the tarmac. He 
cut them off. 

Silence. Stillness. The Med 
Ship’s outside microphones 
picked up small noises of wind 
blowing over the city. There was 
no other sound at all. 

— No. There was a singularly 
deliberate clicking sound, not 
loud and not fast. Perhaps a 
click — a double click — every 
two seconds. That was all. 

Calhoun went into the airlock, 

GALAXY 






with Murgatroyd frisking a little 
in the expectation of great social 
success among the people of this 
world. When Calhoun cracked the 
outer airlock door he smelled 
something. It was a faintly sour, 
astringent odor that had the qual- 
ity of decay in it. But it was no 
kind of decay he recognized. 
Again stillness and silence. No 
traffic-noise; not even the almost 
inaudible murmur that every city 
has in all its ways at all hours. 
The buildings looked as buildings 
should look at daybreak, except 
that the doors and windows were 
open. It was somehow shocking. 

A ruined city is dramatic. An 
abandoned city is pathetic. This 
was neither. It was something 
new. It felt as if everybody had 
walked away, out of sight, within 
the past few minutes. 

Calhoun headed for the space- 
port building with Murgatroyd 
ambling puzzledly at his side. 
Murgatroyd was disturbed. There 
should be people here! They 
should welcome Calhoun and ad- 
mire him — Murgatroyd — and 
he should be a social lion with 
all the sweets he could eat and 
all the coffee he could put into 
his expandable belly. But nothing 
happened! Nothing at all. 

“Chee?” he asked anxiously. 

“They’ve gone away,” growled 
Calhoun. “They probably left in 
ground-cars. There’s not one in 
sight.” 



There wasn’t. Calhoun could 
look out through the grid founda- 
tions and see long, sunlit and ab- 
solutely empty streets. He ar- 
rived at the spaceport building. 
There was — there had been — 
a green area about the base of the 
structure. There was not a living 
plant left. Leaves were wilted and 
limp. The remains had become 
almost a jelly of collapsed stems 
and blossoms of dark olive-green. 
The plants were dead; but not 
long enough to have dried up. 
They might have wilted two or 
three days before. 

Calhoun went in the building. 
The spaceport log lay open on a 
desk. It recorded the arrival of 
freight to be shipped away — 
undoubtedly — on the Candida 
now uneasily in orbit somewhere 
aloft. There was no sign of dis- 
order. It was exactly as if the 
people here had walked out to 
look at something interesting, and 
hadn’t come back. 

Calhoun trudged out of the 
spaceport and to the streets and 
buildings of the city proper. It 
was incredible! Doors were 
opened or unlocked. Merchandise 
in the shops lay on display, ex- 
actly as it had been spread out 
to interest customers. There was 
no sign of confusion anywhere. 
Even in a restaurant there were 
dishes and flatware on the tables. 
The food in the plates was stale, 
as if three days old, but it hadn’t

163 




yet begun to spoil. The appear- 
ance of everything was as if 
people at their meals had simply, 
at some signal, gotten up and 
walked out without any panic or 
disturbance. 

Calhoun made a wry face. He’d 
remembered something. Among 
the tales that had been carried 
from Earth to the other worlds of 
the galaxy there was a completely 
unimportant mystery story which 



people still sometimes tried to 
write an ending to. It was the 
story of an ancient sailing ship 
called the Marie Celeste, which 
was found drifting aimlessly in 
the middle of the ocean. Tliere 
was food on the cabin table, and 
the galley stove was still warm. 
There was no sign of any trouble, 
or terror, or disturbance which 
might cause the ship to be 
abandoned. But there was not a

like this. I don’t like it a bit!” 




living soul on board. Nobody had 
ever been able to contrive a be- 
lievable explanation. 

“Only,” said Calhoun to Mur- 
gatroyd, “this is on a larger scale. 
The people of this city walked 
out about three days ago, and 
didn’t come back. Maybe all the 
people on the planet did the 
same, since there’s not a com- 
municator in operation anywhere. 
To make the understatement of 



II 

O N THE way back to the Med 
Ship, Calhoun stopped at an- 
other place where, on a grass- 
growing planet, there would have 
been green sward. There were 
Earth-type trees, and some native 
ones, and between them there 
should have been a lawn. The 
trees were thriving, but the 
ground-cover plants were col- 
lapsed and rotting. 

Calhoun picked up a bit of the 
semi-slime and smelled it. It was 
faintly sour, astringent, the same 
smell he’d noticed when he 
opened the airlock door. He 
threw the stuff away and brushed 
off his hands. Something had 
killed the ground-cover plants 
which had the habit of killing 
Earth-type grass when planted 
here. 

He listened. Everywhere that 
humans live, there are insects and 
birds and other tiny creatures 
which are essential parts of the 
ecological system to which the 
human race is adjusted. They 
have to be carried to and estab- 
lished upon every new world that 
mankind hopes to occupy. But 
there was no sound of such living 
creatures here. 

It was probable that the bel- 
lowing roar of the Med Ship’s 



MED SHIP MAN 



165 




emergency rockets was the only 
real noise the city had heard 
since its people went away. 

The stillness bothered Murga- 
troyd. He said, “Chee!” in a sub- 
dued tone and stayed close to 
Calhoun. Calhoun shook his head. 
Then he said abruptly: 

“Come along, Murgatroyd!” 

He went back to the building 
housing the grid controls. He 
didn’t look at the spaceport log 
this time. He went to the instru- 
ments recording the second func- 
tion of a landing-grid. In addition 
to lifting up and letting down 
ships of space, a landing-grid 
drew down power from the ions 
of the upper atmosphere and 
broadcast it. It provided all the 
energy that humans on a world 
could need. It was solar power, 
in a way, absorbed and stored by 
a layer of ions miles high, which 
then could be drawn on and dis- 
tributed by the grid. During his 
descent Calhoun had noted that 
broadcast power was still avail- 
able. Now he looked at what the 
instruments said. 

The needle on the dial showing 
power-drain moved slowly back 
and forth. It was a rh5dhmic 
movement, going from maximum 
to minimum power-use, and then 
back again. Approximately six 
million kilowatts was being taken 
out of the broadcast every two 
seconds for half of one second. 
Then the drain cut off for a sec- 



ond and a half, and went on again 
for half a second. 

Frowning, Calhoun raised his 
eyes to a very fine color photo- 
graph on the wall above the pow- 
er dials. It was a picture of the 
human-occupied part of Maya, 
taken four thousand miles out in 
space. It had been enlarged to 
four feet by six, and Maya City 
could be seen as an irregular 
group of squares and triangles 
measuring a little more than half 
an inch by three-quarters. The de- 
tail was perfect. It was possible 
to see perfectly straight, infinitely 
thin lines moving out from the 
city. They were multiple-lane 
highways, mathematically 
straight from one city to another, 
and then mathematically straight 
— though at a new angle — until 
the next. Calhoun stared thought- 
fully at them. 

“The people left the city in a 
hurry,” he told Murgatroyd, “and 
there was little confusion, if any. 
So they knew in advance that 
they might have to go. They were 
ready for it. If they took any- 
thing, they had it ready packed 
in their cars. But they hadn’t 
been sure they’d have to go be- 
cause they were going about their 
businesses as usual. All the shops 
were open and people were eating 
in restaurants, and so on.” 

Murgatroyd said, “C/iee!” as if 
in full agreement. 

“Now,” demanded Calhoun, 



166 



GALAXY 



“where did they go? The ques- 
tion’s really where could they go! 
There were about eight hundred 
thousand people in this city. 
There’d be cars for everyone, of 
course, and two hundred thou- 
sand cars would take everybody. 
But that’s a lot of ground-cars! 
Put ’em two hundred feet apart 
on a highway, and that’s twenty- 
six cars to the mile on each lane. 
Run them at a hundred miles an 
hour on a twelve-lane road — 
using all lanes one way — and 
that’s twenty-six hundred cars per 
lane per hour, and that’s thirty- 
one thousand . two highways 
make sixty-two . three high- 
ways . With two highways 
they could empty the city in un- 
der three hours, and with three 
highways close to two. Since 
there’s no sign of panic, that’s 
what they must have done. Must 
have worked it out in advance, 
too. Maybe they’d done it before 
it happened . whatever it was 
that happened.” 

TTE searched the photograph 
which was so much more de- 
tailed than a map. There were 
mountains to the north of Maya 
City, but only one highway led 
north. There were more moun- 
tains to the west. One highway 
went into them, but not through. 
To the south there was sea, which 
curved aroxmd some three hun- 
dred miles from Maya City and 



put the human colony on Maya 
on a peninsula. 

“They went east,” said Calhoun 
presently. He traced lines with 
his finger. “Three highways go 
east; that’s the only way they 
could go quickly. They hadn’t 
been sure they’d have to go but 
they knew where to go when 
they did. So when they got their 
warning, they left. On three high- 
ways, to the east. And we’ll follow 
them and ask what the hell they 
ran away from. Nothing’s visible 
here!” 

He went back to the Med 
Ship, Murgatroyd skipping with 
him. 

As the airlock door closed be- 
hind them, he heard a click from 
the outside-microphone speakers. 
He listened. It was a doubled 
clicking, as of something turned 
on and almost at once turned off 
again. There was a two-second 
cycle, the same as that of the 
power drain. Something drawing 
six million kilowatts went on and 
immediately off again every two 
seconds. It made a sound in 
speakers linked to outside micro- 
phones, but it didn’t make a noise 
in the air. The microphone clicks 
were induction; pick-up; like 
cross-talk on defective telephone 
cables. 

Calhoun shrugged his shoul- 
ders almost up to his ears. He 
went to the communicator, 

“Calling Candida — ” he began, 



MED SHIP MAN 



167 



and the answer almost leaped 
down his throat. 

“Candida to Med Ship. Come 
in! Come in! What’s happened 
down there?” 

“The city’s deserted without 
any sign of panic,” said Calhoun, 
“and there’s power and nothing 
seems to be broken down. But it’s 
as if somebody had said, ‘Every- 
body clear ouf and they did. 
That doesn’t happen on a whim! 
What’s your next port of call?” 
The Candida’s voice told him, 
hopefully. 

“Take a report,” commanded 
Calhoun. “Deliver it to the public 
health office immediately you. 
land. They’ll get it to Med Ser- 
vice sector headquarters. I’m go- 
ing to stay here and find out 
what’s been going on.” 

He dictated, growing irritated 
as he did so because he couldn’t 
explain what he reported. Some- 
thing serious had taken place, but 
there was no clue as to what it 
was. Strictly speaking, it wasn’t 
certainly a public health affair. 
But any emergency the size of 
this one involved public health 
factors. 

“I’m remaining aground to in- 
vestigate,” finished Calhoun. “I 
will report further when or if it 
is possible. Message ends.” 

“What about our passenger?” 
“To the devil with your pas- 
senger!” said Calhoun peevishly. 
“Do as you please!” 



TTE CUT off the communicator 
and prepared for activity 
outside the ship. Presently he and 
Murgatroyd went to look for 
transportation. The Med Ship 
couldn’t be used for a search op- 
eration; it didn’t carry enough 
rocket fuel. They’d have to use a 
ground vehicle. 

It was again shocking to note 
that nothing had moved but sun 
shadows. Again it seemed that 
everybody had simply walked out 
of some door or other and failed 
to come back. Calhoun saw the 
windows of jewelers’ shops. 
Treasures lay unguarded in 
plain view. He saw a florist’s 
shop. Here there were earth-type 
flowers apparently thriving, and 
some strange beautiful flowers 
with olive-green foliage which 
throve as well as the Earth- 
plants. There was a cage in which 
a plant had grown, and that plant 
was wilting and about to rot. But 
a plant that had to be grown in 
a cage . 

He found a ground-car agency, 
perhaps for imported cars, per- 
haps for those built on Maya. He 
went in and from the cars on 
display he chose one, an elaborate 
sports car. He turned its key and 
it hummed. He drove it carefully 
out into the empty street, Murga- 
troyd sitting interestedly beside 
him. 

“This is luxury, Murgatroyd,” 
said Calhoun. “Also it’s grand 



168 



GALAXY 



theft. We medical characters 
can’t usually afford such things. 
Or have an excuse to steal them. 
But these are parlous times, so 
we take a chance.” 

“Cheer said Murgatroyd. 

“We want to find a fugitive 
population and ask what they 
ran away from. As of the moment, 
it seems that they ran away from 
nothing. They may be pleased to 
know they can come back.” 

Murgatroyd again said, “CheeP’ 
Calhoun drove through vacant 
ways. It was somehow nerve- 
racking. He felt as if someone 
should pop out and say “Boo!” at 
any instant. He discovered an 
elevated highway and a ramp 
leading up to it At a cloverleaf 
he drove eastward, watching 
sharply for any sign of life. There 
was none. 

He was nearly out of the city 
when he felt the chest impact of 
a sonic boom, and then heard a 
trailing away growling sound 
which seemed to come from 
farther away as it died out. It 
was the result of something 
traveling faster than sound, so 
that the noise it made far away 
had to catch up with the sound it 
emitted nearby. 

He stared up. He saw a para- 
chute blossom as a bare speck 
against the blue. Then he heard 
the even deeper-toned roaring 
of a supersonic craft climbing 
skjrward. It could be a space- 



liner’s lifeboat, descended into 
atmosphere and going out again. 

It was. It had left a parachute 
behind, and now went back to 
space to rendezvous with its 
parent ship. 

“That,” said Calhoun impa- 
tiently, “will be the Candida’s pas- 
senger. He was insistent enough.” 

He scowled. The Candida’s 
voice had said its passenger de- 
manded to be landed for business 
reasons. And Calhoun had a prej- 
udice against some kinds of busi- 
ness men who would think their 
own affairs more important than 
anything else. Two standard 
years before, he’d made a plane- 
tary health inspection on Texia 
II, in another galactic sector. It 
was a llano planet and a single 
giant business enterprise. Illimit- 
able prairies had been sown with 
an Earth-type grass which de- 
stroyed the native ground-cover 
— the reverse of the ground-cover 
situation here — and the entire 
planet was a monstrous range for 
beef cattle. Dotted about were gi- 
gantic slaughterhouses, and cat- 
tle in masses of tens of thousands 
were shifted here and there by 
ground-induction fields which 
acted as fences. Ultimately the 
cattle were driven by these same 
induction fences to the slaughter 
houses and actually into the 
chutes where their throats were 
slit. Every imaginable fraction of 
a credit of profit was extracted

from their carcasses, and Calhoim 
had found it appalling. 

He was not sentimental about 
cattle, but the complete cold- 
bloodedness of the entire opera- 
tion sickened him. The same cold- 
bloodedness was practised toward 
the human employees who ran 
the place. Their living quarters 
were sub-marginal. The air stank 
of cattle murder. Men worked for 
the Texia Company or they did 
not work. If they did not work 
they did not eat. If they worked 
and ate, — Calhoun could see 
nothing satisfying in being alive 
on a world like that! His report 
to Med Service had been biting. 
He’d been prejudiced against 
businessmen ever since. 

T>UT A parachute descended, 
^ blowing away from the city. 
It would land not too far from 
the highway he followed. And it 
didn’t occur to Calhoun not to 
help the unknown chutist. He 
saw a small figure dangling be- 
low the chute. He slowed the 
ground-car as he estimated where 
the parachute would land. 

He was off the twelve-lane 
highway and on a feeder road 
when the chute was a hundred 
feet high. He was racing across 
a field of olive-green plants that 
went all the way to the horizon 
when the parachute actually 
touched ground. There was a con- 
siderable wind. The man in the 



harness boimced. He didn’t know 
how to spill the air. The chute 
dragged him. 

Calhoun sp>ed ahead, swerved 
and ran into the chute. He 
stoppjed the car and the chute 
stopp>ed with it. He got out. 

The man lay in a hopieless 
tangle of cordage. He thrust un- 
skilfully at it. When Calhoun 
came up he said suspiciously: 
“Have you a knife?” 

Calhoun offered a knife, polite- 
ly opjening its blade. The man 
slashed at the cords and freed 
himself, There was an attache 
case lashed to his chute harness. 
He cut at those cords. The at- 
tache case not only came clear, 
but opened. It dumpjed out an 
incredible mass of brand new, 
tightly packed interstellar credit 
certificates. Calhoun could see 
that the denominations were one 
thousand and ten thousand cred- 
its. The man from the chute 
reached under his armpit and 
drew out a blaster. 

It was not a service weapon. It 
was elaborate, practically a toy. 
With a dour glance at Calhoun 
he put it in a side pocket and 
gathered up the scattered money. 
It was an enormous sum, but he 
packed it back. He stood up. 

“My name is Allison,” he said 
in an authoritative voice. “Arthur 
Allison. I’m much obliged. Now 
I’ll ask you to take me to Maya 
City.” 



170

“No,” said Calhoun p>olitely. “I 
just left there. It’s deserted. I’m 
not going back. There’s nobody 
there.” 

“But I’ve important bus — ” 
The other man stared. “It’s de- 
■serted? But that’s impossible!” 
“Quite,” agreed Calhoun, “but 
it’s true. It’s abandoned. Unin- 
habited. Everybody’s left it. 
There’s no one there at all.” 

The man who called himself 
Allison blinked unbelievingly. He 
swore. Then he raged profanely. 

But he was not bewildered by 
the news. Which, upjon consider- 
ation, was itself almost bewilder- 
ing. But then his eyes grew 
shrewd. He looked about him. 

“My name is Allison,” he re- 
p>eated, as if there were some sort 
of magic in the word. “Arthur 
Allison. No matter what’s hap- 
pened, I’ve some business to do 
here. Where have the people 
gone? I need to find them.” 

“I need to find them too,” said 
Calhoun. “I’ll take you with me, 
if you like.” 

“You’ve heard of me.” It was 
a statement, confidently made. 

“Never,” said Calhoun politely. 
“If you’re not hurt, suppose you 
get in the car? I’m as anxious as 
you are to find out what’s hap>- 
pjened. I’m Med Service.” 



A 



LLISON MOVED toward the 
car. 

Med Service, eh? I don’t think 



MED SHIP MAN 

1 



much of the Med Service! You 
pjeople try to meddle in things 
that are none of your business!” 

Calhoun did not answer. The 
muddy man, clutching the attache 
case tightly, waded through the 
olive-green plants to the car and 
climbed in. Murgatroyd said cor- 
dially, “Chee-c/iee!” but Allison 
viewed him with distaste. 

“What’s this?” 

“He’s Murgatroyd,” said Cal- 
houn. “He’s a tOTtnal. He’s Med 
service p>ersonneL” 

“I don’t like beasts,” said Alli- 
son coldly. 

“He’s much more iniportant to 
me than you are,” said Calhoun, 
“if the matter should come to a 
test.” 

Allison stared at him as if ex- 
pjecting him to cringe. Calhoun 
did not. Allison showed every 
sign of being an important man 
who expjected his importance to 
be recognized and catered to. 
When Calhoun stirred impatient- 
ly he got into the car and 
growled a little. Calhoun took his 
place. The ground-car hummed. 
It rose on the six columns of air 
which took the place of wheels 
and slid across the field of dark- 
green plants, leaving the para- 
chute deflated across a number 
of rows, and a trail of crushed- 
down plants where it had moved. 

It reached the highway again. 
Calhoun ran the car up on the 
highway’s shoulder, and then sud- 



171 



denly checked. He’d noticed 
something. 

He stopped the car and got out. 
Where the ploughed field ended, 
and before the coated surface of 
the highway began, there was a 
space where on another world one 
would expect to see green grass. 

On this planet grass did not 
grow; but there would normally 
be some sort of self-planted vege- 
tation where there was soil and 
sunshine and moisture. There had 
been such vegetation here, but 
now there was only a thin, repel- 
lent mass of slimy and decaying 
foliage. Calhoun bent down to it. 

It had a sour, faintly astringent 
smell of decay. These were the 
ground-cover plants of Maya of 
which Calhoun had read. They 
had motile stems, leaves and 
flowers, and they had canniba- 
listic tendencies. They were the 
local weeds which made it im- 
possible to grow grain for human 
use upon this world. 

And they were dead. 

Calhoun straightened up and 
returned to the car. Plants like 
this were wilted at the base of the 
spaceport building, and on an- 
other place where there should 
have been sward. Calhoun had 
seen a large dead member of the 
genus in a florist’s, that had been 
growing in a cage before it died. 
There was a singular coincidence 
here: humans ran away from 
something, and something caused 



the death of a particular genus of 
cannibal weeds. 

It did not exactly add up to 
anything in particular, and cer- 
tainly wasn’t evidence for any- 
thing at all. But Calhoun drove 
on in a vaguely puzzled mood. 
The germ of a guess was forming 
in his mind. He couldn’t pretend 
to himself that it was likely, but 
it was surely no more unlikely 
than most of a million human be- 
ings abandoning their homes at 
a moment’s notice. 

Ill 

^^HEY came to the turnoff for 
a town called Tenochitlan, 
some forty miles from Maya City. 
Calhoun swung off the highway 
to go through it. 

Whoever had chosen the name 
Maya for this planet had been 
interested in the legends of Yuca- 
tan, back on Earth. There were 
many instances of such hobbies 
in a Med Ship’s list of ports of 
call. Calhoun touched ground reg- 
ularly on planets that had been 
named for countries and towns 
when men first roamed the stars, 
and nostalgically christened their 
discoveries with names suggested 
by homesickness. There was a 
Tralee, and a Dorset, and an Eire. 
Colonists not infrequently took 
their world’s given name as a pat- 
tern and chose related names for 
seas and peninsulas and moimtain 



172 



GALAXY 



chains. On Texia the landing-grid 
rose near a town called Corral 
and the principal meat-packing 
settlement was named Roundup. 

Whatever the name Tenochit- 
lan would have suggested, though, 
was denied by the town itself. It 
was a small, with a pleasing local 
type of architecture. There were 
shops and some factories, and. 
many strictly private homes, 
some clustered close together and 
others in the middles of consider- 
able gardens. In those gardens 
also there was wilt and decay 
among the cannibal plants. There 
was no grass, because the plants 
prevented it, but now the motile 
plants themselves were dead. Ex- 
cept for the one class of killed 
growing things, however, vegeta- 
tion was luxuriant. 

But the little city was deserted. 
Its streets were empty, its houses 
untenanted. Some houses were 
apparently locked up here, 
though, and Calhoun saw three or 
four shops whose stock im trade 
had been covered over before the 
owners departed. He guessed that 
either this town had been warned 
earlier than the spaceport city, or 
else they knew they had time to 
get in motion before the highways 
were filled with the cars from the 
west. 

Allison looked at the houses 
with keen, evaluating eyes. He 
did not seem to notice the ab- 
sence of people. When Calhoun 



swung back on the great road 
beyond the little city, Allison re- 
garded the endless fields of dark- 
green plants with much the same 
sort of interest. 

“Interesting,” he said abruptly 
when Tenochitlan fell behind and 
dwindled to a speck. “Very inter- 
esting! I’m interested in land. 
Real property, that’s my business. 
I’ve a land-owning corporation on 
Thanet Three. I’ve some holdings 
on Dorset, too, and elsewhere. It 
just occurred to me: what’s all • 
this land and the cities worth, 
with the people all run away?” 
“What,” asked Calhoun, “are 
the people worth who’ve run?” 
Allison paid no attention. He 
looked shrewd. Thoughtful. 

“I came here to buy land,” he 
said. “I’d arranged to buy some 
hundreds of square miles. I’d buy 
more if the price were right. But 
— as things are, it looks like the 
price of land ought to go down 
quite a bit. Quite a bit!” 

“It depends,” said Calhoun, “on 
whether there’s anybody left alive 
to sell it to you, and what sort of 
thing has happened.” 

Allison looked at him sharply. 
“Ridiculous!” he said authori- 
tatively. “There’s no question of 
their being alive!” 

“They thought there might be,” 
observed Calhoun. “That’s why 
they ran away. They hoped 
they’d be safe where they ran to. 
I hope they are.” 



MED SHIP MAN

Allison ignored the comment. 
His eyes remained intent and 
shrewd. He was not bewildered 
by the flight of the people of 
Maya. His mind was busy with 
contemplation of that flight from 
the standpoint of a man of busi- 
ness. 

^1 ■'HE CAR went racing onward. 

The endless fields of dark 
green rushed past to the rear. 
The highway was deserted, just 
three strips of surfaced road, 
mathematically straight, going on 
to the horizon. They went on by 
tens and scores of miles, each 
strip wide enough to allow four 
ground-cars to nm side by side. 
The highway was intended to 
allow all the produce of all these 
fields to be taken to market or a 
processing plant at the highest 
possible sp>eed and in any imagin- 
able quantity. The same roads 
had allowed the cities to be de- 
serted instantly the warning — 
whatever the warning was — ar- 
rived. 

Fifty miles beyond Tenochit- 
lan there was a mile-long strip of 
sheds containing agricultural ma- 
chinery for crop culture and 
trucks to carry the crops to mar- 
ket. There was no sign of life 
about the machinery, nor in a 
further hour’s run to westward. 

Then there was a city visible 
to the left. But it was not served 
by this particular highway, but 



another. There was no sign of 
any movement in its streets. It 
moved along the horizon to the 
left and rear. Presently it disap- 
peared. 

Half an hour later still, Murga- 
troyd said: 

“Chee!” 

He stirred uneasily. A moment 
later he said “Chee!” again. 

Calhoun turned his eyes from 
the road. Murgatroyd looked un- 
happy. Calhoun ran his hand over 
the tormaVs furry body. Murga- 
troyd pressed against him. The 
car raced on. Murgatroyd whim- 
pered a little. Calhoun’s hand felt 
the little animal’s muscles tense 
sharply, and then relax, and after 
a little tense again. Murgatroyd 
said almost hysterically: 
“Chee-chee-chee-cheel” 

Calhoun stopped the car, but 
Murgatroyd did not seem to be 
relieved. Allison said impatiently, 
“What’s the matter?” 

“That’s what I’m trying to find 
out,” said Calhoun. 

He felt Murgatroyd’s pulse. 
The role of Murgatroyd in the 
Med Ship Esclipus Twenty was 
not only that of charming com- 
panion in the long, isolated runs 
in overdrive. Murgatroyd was a 
part of the Med Service. His tribe 
had been discovered on a planet 
in the Deneb sector, and men had 
made pets of them, to the high 
satisfaction of the tormals. Pres- 
ently it was discovered that vet- 



174 



GALAXY 



erinarians never had tormals for 
patients. They were invariably in 
robustuous good health. They 
contracted no infections from 
other animals; they shared no 
infections with anybody else. The 
Med Service discovered that tor- 
mals possessed a dynamic immu- 
nity to germ and bacteria-caused 
diseases. Even viruses injected 
into their bloodstreams only pro- 
voked an immediate, overwhelm- 
ing development of antibodies, so 
that tormals couldn’t be given 
any known disease. Which was of 
infinite value to the Med Service. 

Now every Med Ship that 
could be supplied with a tormal 
carried a small, affectionate, 
whiskered member of the tribe. 
Men liked them, and they adored 
men. And when, as sometimes 
happened, by mutation or the 
simple enmity of nature, a new 
kind of infection appeared in hu- 
man society — why — tormals 
defeated it. They produced spe- 
cific antibodies to destroy it. Men 
analyzed the antibodies and syn- 
thesized them, and they were 
available to all the humans who 
needed them. So a great many 
millions of humans stayed alive, 
because tormals were pleasant 
little animals with a precious ge- 
netic gift of good health. 

I^ALHOUN LOOKED AT his 
^ sweep-second watch, timing 
the muscular spasms that Murga- 



troyd displayed. They coincided 
with irregularities in Murga- 
troyd’s heartbeat, coming at ap- 
proximately two-second intervals. 
The tautening of the muscles 
lasted just about half a second. 

“But I don’t feel it!” said Cal- 
houn. 

Murgatroyd whimpered again 
and said, “Chee-chee!” 

“What’s going on?” demanded 
Allison with the impatience of a 
very important man indeed. “If 
the beast’s sick, he’s sick! I’ve got 
to find — ” 

■ Calhoun ojjened his med kit 
and went carefully through it 
until he found what he needed. 
He put a pill into Murgatroyd’s 
mouth. 

“Swallow it!” he commanded. 

Murgatroyd resisted, but the 
pill went down. Calhoun watched 
him sharply. Murgatroyd’s diges- 
tive system was delicate, but it 
was dependable. Anything that 
might be poisonous, Murgatroyd’s 
stomach rejected instantly and 
emphatically. 

The pill stayed down. 

“Look!” said Allison indignant- 
ly. “I’ve got business to do! In 
this attache case I have millions 
of interstellar credits, in cash, to 
pay down on purchases of land 
and factories. I ought to make 
some damned good deals! And I 
figure that that’s as important as 
an3Tthing else you can think of! 
It’s a damned sight more impor- 



MED SHIP MAN 



175 



tant than a beast with a belly- 
ache!” 

Calhoun looked at him coldly. 

“Do you own land on Texia?” 
he asked. 

Allison’s mouth dropped open. 
Extreme suspicion and unease ap- 
peared on his face. As a sign of 
the unease, his hand went to the 
side coat pocket in which he’d 
put a blaster. He didn’t pluck it 
out. Calhoun’s left fist swung 
around^ and landed. He took Alli- 
son’s elaborate pocket blaster and 
threw it away among the monot- 
onous rows of olive-green plants. 
He returned to absorbed observa- 
tion of Murgatroyd. 

In five minutes the muscular 
spasms diminished. In ten, Murg- 
atroyd frisked. But he seemed to 
think that Calhoun had done 
something remarkable. In the 
warmest of tones he said: 

“Chee!” 

“Very good,” said Calhoun. 
“We’ll go ahead. I suspect you’ll 
do as well as we do — for a 
while.” 

The car lifted the few inches 
the air columns sustained it above 
the ground. It went on, still to 
the eastward. But Calhoun drove 
more slowly now. 

“Something was giving Murga- 
troyd rhythmic muscular spasms,” 
he said coldly. “I gave him medi- 
cation to stop them. He’s more 
sensitive than we are, so he re- 
acted to a stimulus we haven’t 



noticed yet. But I think we’ll no- 
tice it presently.” 

Allison seemed to be dazed at 
the affront given him. It appeared 
to be unthinkable that anybody 
mighf lay hands on him. 

“What the devil has that to do 
with me?” he demanded angrily. 
“And what did you hit me for? 
You’re going to pay for this!” 
“Until I do,” Calhoun told him, 
“you’ll be quiet. And it does have 
the devil to do with you. There 
was a Med Service gadget once 
— a tricky little device to pro- 
duce contraction of chosen mus- 
cles. It was useful for re-starting 
stopped hearts without the need 
of an operation. It regulated the 
beat of hearts that were too slow 
or dangerously irregular. But 
some businessman had a bright 
idea and got a tame researcher to 
link that gadget to ground induc- 
tion currents. ! suspect you know 
that businessman!” 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about,” snapped Allison. But 
he was singularly tense. 

“I do,” said Calhoim unpleas- 
antly. “I made a public health in- 
spection on Texia a couple of 
years ago. The whole planet is a 
single, gigantic, cattle-raising en- 
terprise. They don’t use metal 
fences — the herds are too big to 
be stopped by such things. They 
don’t use cowboys — they cost 
money. On Texia they use 
ground-induction and the Med 



176 



GALAXY 



, Service gadget linked together to 
‘ serve ' as cattle fences. They act 
^ like fences, though they’re pro- 
jected through the ground. Cattle 
become uncomfortable when they 
try to cross them. So they draw 
back. So men control them. They 
move them from place to place 
by changing the cattle fences, 
which are currents induced in the 
ground. The cattle have to keep 
moving or be punished by the 
moving fence. They’re even 
driven into the slaughterhouse 
chutes by ground-induction fields! 
That’s the trick on Texia, where 
induction fields herd cattle. I 
think it’s the trick on Maya, 
where people are herded like cat- 
tle and driven out of their cities 
so the value of their fields and 
factories will drop, — so a land 
buyer can find bargains!” 

“You’re insane!” snapped Alli- 
son. “I just landed on this planet! 
You saw me land! I don’t know 
what happened before I got here! 
How could I?” 

“You might have arranged it,” 
said Calhoim. 

A LLISON assumed an air of 
offended and superior digni- 
ty. Calhoun drove the car onward 
at very much less than the head- 
long pace he’d been keeping to. 
Presently he looked down at his 
hands on the steering wheel. Now 
and then the tendons to his fin- 
gers seemed to twitch. At rhyth- 



mic intervals, the skin crawled on 
the back of his hands. He glanced 
at Allison. Allison’s hands were 
tightly clenched. 

“There’s a ground-induction 
fence in action, all right,” said 
Calhoun calmly. “You notice? It’s 
a cattle fence and we’re running 
into it. If we were cattle, now, 
we’d turn around and move 
away.” 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about!” said Allison. 

But his hands stayed clenched. 
Calhoun slowed the car still more. 
He began to feel, all over his 
body, that every muscle tended 
to twitch at the same time. It 
was a horrible sensation. His 
heart muscles tended to contract 
too, simultaneously with the rest, 
but one’s heart has its own beat 
rate. Sometimes the normal beat 
coincided with the twitch. Then 
his heart pounded violently — 
so violently that it was painful. 
But equally often the imposed 
contraction of the heart muscles 
came just after a normal con- 
traction, and then it stayed tight- 
ly knotted for half a second. It 
missed a beat, and the feeling was 
agony. 

No animal would have pressed 
forward in the face of such sen- 
sations. It would have turned 
back long ago. No animal. Not 
even Man. 

Calhoun stopped the car. He 
looked at Murgatroyd. Murga- 



MED SHIP MAN 



177 



troyd was completely himself. He 
looked inquiringly at Calhoun. 
Calhoun nodded to him, but he 
spoke — with some difficulty — 
to Allison. 

“We’ll see — if this thing — 
builds up. You know that it’s the 
Texia — trick. A ground — in- 
duction unit set up — here. It 
drove people — like cattle. Now 
we’ve — run into it. — It’s hold- 
ing people — like cattle.” 

He panted. His chest muscles 
contracted with the rest, so that 
his breathing was interfered with. 
But Murgatroyd, who’d been 
made uneasy and uncomfortable 
before Calhoun noticed anything 
wrong, was now bright and frisky. 
Medication had desensitized his 
muscles to outside stimuli. He 
would be able to take a consider- 
able electric shock without re- 
sponding to it. 

But he could be killed by one 
that was strong enough. 

A savage anger filled Calhoun. 
Everything fitted together. Alli- 
son had put his hand convenient 
to his blaster when Calhoun men- 
tioned Texia. It meant that Cal- 
houn suspected what Allison 
knew to be true. A cattle-fence 
unit had been set up on Maya, 
and it was holding — like cattle 
— the people it had previously 
driven — like cattle. Calhoun 
could deduce with some precision 
exactly what had been done. The 
first experience of Maya with the 



cattle fence would have been very 
mild. It would have been low- 
power, causing just enough un- 
easiness to be noticed. It would 
have moved from west to east, 
slowly, and it would have reached 
a certain spot and there faded 
out. And it would have been a 
mystery and an uncomfortable 
thing, and nobody would under- 
stand it on Maya. In a week it 
would almost be forgotten. But 
then there’d come a stronger dis- 
turbance. And it would travel 
like the first one; down the length 
of the peninsula on which the 
colony lay, but stopping at the 
same spot as before, and then 
fading away to nothingness. And 
this also would have seemed mys- 
terious. But nobody would sus- 
pect humans of causing it. There 
would be theorizing and much 
questioning, but it would be con- 
sidered an unfamiliar natural 
event. 

Probably the third use of the 
cattle fence would be most dis- 
turbing. This time it would be 
acutely painful. But it would 
move into the cities and through 
them and past them, and it would 
go down the peninsula to where 
it had stopped and faded on two 
previous occasions. 

The p>eople of Maya would be 
disturbed and scared. But they 
considered that they knew it be- 
gan to the westward of Maya 
City, and moved toward the east 



178 



GALAXY 



at such-and-such a speed, and it 
went so far and no farther. And 
they would organize themselves 
to apply this carefully worked 
out information. 

It would not occur to any of 
them that they had learned how 
to be driven like cattle. 

^ALHOUN, of course, could 
only reason that this must 
have happened. But nothing else 
could have taken place. Perhaps 
there were more than three uses 
of the moving cattle fence to get 
the F>eople prepared to move past 
the known place at which it al- 
ways faded to nothingness. They 
might have been days apart, or 
weeks apart, or months. There 
might have been stronger mani- 
festations followed by weaker 
ones and then stronger ones again. 

But there was an inductive cat- 
tle fence across the highway here. 
Calhoun had driven into it. Every 
two seconds the muscles of his 
body tensed. Sometimes his heart 
missed a beat at the time that his 
breathing stopped, and some- 
times it pounded violently. It 
seemed that the symptoms be- 
came more and more unbearable. 

He got out his med kit, with 
hands that spasmodically jerked 
uncontrollably. He fumbled out 
the same medication he’d given 
Murgatroyd. He took two of the 
pellets. 

“In reason,” he said coldly, “I 



ought to let you take what this 
damned thing would give you. 
But — here!” 

Allison had panicked. The idea 
of a cattle fence suggested dis- 
comfort, of course, but it did not 
imply danger. The experience of 
a cattle fence, designed for huge 
hoofed beasts instead of men, was 
terrifying. Allison gasp>ed. He 
made convulsive movements. Cal- 
houn himself moved erratically. 
For one and a half seconds out of 
two, he could control his muscles. 
For half a second at a time, he 
could not. But he poked a pill 
into Allison’s mouth. 

“Swallow it!” he commanded. 
“Swallow!” 

The ground-car rested tranquil- 
ly on the highway, which here 
went on for a mile and then 
dipped in a gentle incline and 
then rose once more. The totally 
level fields to right and left came 
to an end here. Native trees grew, 
trailing prejKisterously with long 
fronds. Brushwood hid much of 
the ground. That looked normal. 
But the lower, ground-covering 
vegetation was wilted and rotting. 

Allison choked upon the pellet. 
Calhoun forced a second upon 
him. Murgatroyd looked inquis- 
itively at first one and then the 
other of the two men. He said: 

“Chee? Chee?” 

Calhoun lay back in his seat, 
breathing carefully to keep alive. 
But he couldn’t do anything

about his heartbeat. The sun 
shone brightly, though now it was 
low, toward the horizon. There 
were clouds in the reddened sky. 
A gentle breeze blew. Everything, 
to outward appearance, was 
peaceful and tranquil and com- 
monplace upon this small world. 

But in the area that human be- 
ings had taken over there were 
cities which were still and silent 
and deserted, and somewhere — 
somewhere! — the population of 
the planet waited uneasily for 
the latest of a series of increas- 
ingly terrifying phenomena to 
come to an end. Up to this time 
the strange, creeping, universal 
affliction had begun at ode place, 
and moved slowly to another, and 
then diminished and ceased to be. 



But this was the greatest and 
worst of the torments. And it 
hadn’t ended. It hadn’t dimin- 
ished. After three days it con- 
tinued at full strength at the 
place where previously it had 
stopped and died away. 

The people of Maya were

frightened. They couldn’t return 
to their homes. They couldn’t go 
anywhere. They hadn’t prepared 
for an emergency to last for days. 
They hadn’t brought supplies of 
food. 

It began to look as if they were 
going to starve. o

^ALHOUN was in very bad 
shape when the sports car 
came to the end of the highway. 

First, all the multiple roadways 
of the route that had brought him 
here were joined by triple ribbons 
of road-surface from the north. 
For a space there were twenty- 
four lanes available to traffic. 
They flowed together, and then 
there were twelve. Here there was 
evidence of an enormous traffic 
concentration at some time now 
past. Brush and small trees were 
crushed and broken where cars 
had been forced to travel off the 
hard-surface roadways and 
through undergrowth. The twelve 
lanes dwindled to six, and the un- 
paved area on either side showed 
that innumerable cars had been 
forced to travel off the highway 
altogether. Then there were three 
lanes, and then two, and finally 
only a single ribbon of pavement 
where no more than two cars 
could run side by side. The dev- 
astation on either hand was 
astounding. All visible vegeta- 
tion for half a mile to right and 
left was crushed and tangled. 
And then the narrow surfaced 
road ceased to be completely 
straight. It curved around a hil- 
lock — and here the ground was 
no longer perfectly flat — and 
came to an end. 

And Calhoun saw all the 



MED SHIP MAN 



181 



ground-cars of the planet gath- 
ered and parked together. 

There were no buildings. There 
were no streets. There was noth- 
ing of civilization but tens and 
scores of thousands of ground- 
cars. They were extraordinary to 
look at, stopped at random, their 
fronts pointed in all directions, 
their air-column tubes thrusting 
into the ground so that there 
might be trouble getting them 
clear again. 

Parked bumper to bumper in 
closely placed lines, in theory 
twenty-five thousand cars could 
be parked on a square mile of 
ground. But there were very 
many times that number of cars 
here, and some places were un- 
suitable for parking, and there 
were lanes placed at random and 
there’d been no special effort to 
put the maximum number of cars 
in the smallest place. So the sur- 
face transportation system of the 
planet Maya spread out over 
some fifty sprawling square miles. 
Here, cars were crowded closely. 
There, there was much room be- 
tween them. But it seemed that 
as far as one could see in the twi- 
light there were glistening vehi- 
cles gathered confusedly, so there 
was nothing else to be seen but 
an occasional large tree rising 
from among them. 

Calhoun came to the end of 
the surfaced road. He’d waited 
for the pellets he’d taken and 



given to Allison to have the effect 
they’d had on Murgatroyd. That 
had come about. He’d driven on. 
But the strength of the inductor 
field had increased to the intol- 
erable. When he stopped the 
sports car he showed the effects 
of what he’d been through. 

Figures on foot converged 
upon him instantly. There were 
eager calls. 

“It’s , stopped? You got 
through? We can go back?” 

Calhoun shook his head. It 
was just past sunset and many 
brilliant colorings showed in the 
western sky, but they couldn’t 
put color into Calhoun’s face. His 
cheeks were grayish and his eyes 
were deep)-sunk, and he looked 
like someone in the last stages of 
exhaustion. He said heavily: 

“It’s still there. We came 
through. I’m Med Service. Have 
you got a government here? I 
need to talk to somebody who can 
give orders.” 

TF he’d asked two days earlier 
there would have been no 
answer, because the fugitives 
were only waiting for a disaster 
to come to an end. One day earli- 
er, he might have found men with 
authority busily trying to arrange 
for drinking water for something 
like two millions of people, in the 
entire absence of wells or pumps 
or ways of making either. And if 
he’d been a day later, it is rather 



182 



GALAXY 



likely that he’d have found sav- 
age disorder. But he arrived at 
sundown three days after the 
flight from the cities. There was 
no food to speak of, and water 
was drastically short, and the fu- 
gitives were only beginning to 
suspect that they would never be 
able to leave this place — and 
that they might die here. 

Men left the growing crowd 
about the sports car to find indi- 
viduals who could give orders. 
Calhoun stayed in the car, resting 
from the unbearable strain he’d 
undergone. The ground-inductor 
cattle fence had been ten miles 
deep. One mile was not bad. Only 
Murgatroyd had noticed it. After 
two miles Calhoun and Allison 
suffered; but the medication 
strengthened them to take it. But 
there’d been a long, long way in 
the center of the induction-field 
in which existence was pure tor- 
ment. Calhoun’s muscles defied 
him for part of every two-second 
cycle, and his heart and lungs 
seemed constantly about to give 
up even the pretense of working. 
In that part of the cattle-fence 
field, he’d hardly dared drive 
faster than a crawl, in order to 
keep control of the car when his 
own body was uncontrollable. 
But presently the field strength 
lessened and ultimately ended. 

Now Murgatroyd looked cor- 
dially at the figures who clustered 
about the car. He’d hardly suf- 



fered at all. He’d had half as 
much of the medication as Cal- 
houn himself, and his body weight 
was only a tenth of Calhoun’s. 
He’d made out all right. Now he 
looked expectantly at what be- 
came a jammed mass of crowd- 
ing men about the vehicle that 
had come through the invisible 
barrier across the highway. They 
hoped desperately for news to 
produce hope. But Murgatroyd 
waited zestfully for somebody to 
welcome him and offer him cakes 
and sweets, and undoubtedly 
presently a cup of coffee. 

But nobody did. 

It was a long time before there 
was a stirring at the edge of the 
crowd. Night had fully fallen 
then, and for miles and miles in 
all directions lights in the ground 
cars of Maya’s inhabitants 
glowed brightly. They drew upon 
broadcast power, naturally, for 
their motors and their lights. Off 
to one side someone shouted. Cal- 
houn turned on his headlights for 
a guide. More shoutings. A knot 
of men struggled to get through 
the crowd. With difficulty, pres- 
ently, they reached the car. 

“They say you got through,” 
panted a tall man, “but you can’t 
get back. They say — ” 

Calhoun roused himself. Alli- 
son, beside him, stirred. The tall 
man panted again; 

“I’m the planetary president. 
What can we do?” 



MED SHIP MAN 



183 



“First, listen,” said Calhoun 
tiredly. 

He’d had a little rest. Not 
much, but some. The actual work 
he’d done in driving three hun- 
dred-odd miles from Maya City 
was trivial. But the continuous, 
and lately violent, spasms of his 
heart and breathing muscles had 
been exhausting. He heard Mur- 
gatroyd say ingratiatingly, “Chee- 
chee-chee-chee,” and put his hand 
on the little animal to quiet him. 

“The thing you ran away 
from,” said Calhoun with effort, 
“is a type of ground-induction 
field using broadcast power from 
the grid. It’s used on Texia to 
confine cattle to their pastures 
and to move them where they’re 
wanted to be. But it was designed 
for cattle. It’s a cattle fence. It 
could kill humans.” 

XJE WENT on, his voice gain- 
ing strength and steadiness 
as he spoke. He explained, pre- 
cisely, how a ground-induction 
field was projected in a line at a 
right angle to its source. It could 
be moved by adjustments of the 
apparatus by which it was pro- 
jected. 

“But — but if it uses broad- 
cast power,” the planetary presi- 
dent said urgently, “then if the 
power broadcast is cut off it has 
to stop! If you got through it 
coming here, tell us how to get 
through going back and we’ll cut 



off the power broadcast ourselves! 
We’ve got to do something im- 
mediately. The whole planet’s 
here. There’s no food! There’s no 
water! Something has to be done 
before we begin to die!” 

“But,” said Calhoun, “if you cut 
off the power you’ll die anyway! 
You’ve got a couple of million 
people here, and you’re a hundred 
miles from food. Without power 
you couldn’t get to food or bring 
it here. Cut the power and you’re 
still stranded here. Without pow- 
er you’ll die' as soon as with it.” 
There was a sound from the 
listening men around. It was 
partly a growl and partly a groan. 

“I’ve just found this out,” said 
Calhoun. “I didn’t know until the 
last ten miles exactly what the 
situation was, and I had to come 
here to be sure. Now I need some 
people to help me. It won’t be 
pleasant. I may have enough 
medication to get a dozen people 
back through. It’ll be safer if I 
take only six. Get a doctor to 
pick me six men. Good heart 
action. Sound lungs. Two should 
be electronics engineers. The 
others should be good shots. If 
you get them ready. I’ll give them 
the same stuff that got us through. 
It’s desensitizing medication, but 
it will do only so much. And try 
and find some weapons for them.” 
Voices murmured all around. 
Men hastily explained to other 
men what Calhoun had said. The 






184 



GALAXY 



! 



creeping disaster before which 
they’d all fled, — it was not a 
natural catastrophe, but an arti- 
ficial one! Men had made it! 
They’d been herded here and 
their wives and children were 
hungry because of something men 
had done! 

A low-pitched, buzzing, hum- 
ming sound came from the crowd 
about the sports car. For the mo- 
ment, nobody asked what could 
be the motive for men to do what 
had been done. Pure fury filled 
the mob. Calhoun leaned closer 
to Allison. 

“I wouldn’t get out of the car 
if I were you,” he said in a low 
tone. “I certainly wouldn’t try to 
buy any real property at a low 
price!” 

Allison shivered. There was a 
vast, vast stirring as the explana- 
tion passed from man to man. 
Figures moved away in the dark- 
ness. Lighted car windows winked 
as they moved through the ob- 
scurity. The population of Maya 
was spread out over very many 
square miles of what had been 
wilderness, and there was no 
elaborate communication system 
by which information could be 
spread quickly. But long before 
dawn there’d be nobody who 
didn’t know that they’d fled from 
a man-made danger and were 
held here like cattle, behind a 
cattle fence, apparently aban- 
doned to die. 



A LLISON’S teeth chattered. 

He was a business man and 
up to now he’d thought as one. 
He’d made decisions in offices, 
with attorneys and secretaries 
and clerks to make the decisions 
practical and safe, without any 
concern for any consequences 
other than financial ones. 

He saw possible consequences 
to himself, here and now. He’d 
landed on Maya because he con- 
sidered the matter too important 
to trust to anybody else. Even 
riding with Calhoun on the way 
here, he’d only been elated and 
astonished at the success of the 
intended coup. He’d raised his 
aim. For a while he’d believed 
that he’d end as the sole proprie- 
tor of the colony on Maya, with 
every plant growing for his profit, 
and every factory earning money 
for him, and every inhabitant his 
employee. It had been the most 
grandiose possible dream. The de- 
tails and the maneuvers needed 
to complete it flowed into his 
mind. 

But now his teeth chattered. At 
ten words from Calhoun he Would 
literally be torn to pieces by the 
raging men about him. His at- 
tache case with millions of credits 
in cash — it would be proof of 
whatever Calhoun chose to say. 
Allison knew terror down to the 
bottom of his soul. But he dared 
not move from Calhoun’s side, 
even though a single sentence in 



MED SHIP MAN 



185 



the calmest of voices would de- 
stroy him, and he’d never faced 
actual, understood, physical dan- 
ger before. 

Presently men came, one by 
one, to take orders from Calhoun. 
They were able-bodied and grim- 
faced men. Two were electronics 
engineers, as he’d specified. One 
was a policeman. There were two 
mechanics and a doctor who was 
also amateur tennis champion of 
the planet. Calhoun doled out to 
them the pellets that reduced the 
sensitiveness of muscles to exter- 
nally applied stimuli. He gave in- 
structions. They’d go as far into 
the cattle fence as they could 
reasonably endure. Then they’d 
swallow the pellets and let them 
act. Then they’d go on. His stock 
of pellets was limited. He could 
give three to each man. 

Murgatroyd squirmed disap- 
pointedly as this briefing went on. 
Obviously, he wasn’t to make a 
social success here. He was an- 
noyed, and he needed more space. 
Calhoun tossed Allison’s attache 
case behind the seats. Allison was 
too terrified to protest. It still did 
not increase the space left on the 
front seat between Calhoun and 
Allison. 

Four humming ground cars 
lifted eight inches off the ground 
and hovered there on columns 
of rushing air. Calhoun took the 
lead. His headlights moved down 
the single-lane road to which two 

186 



joining twelve-lane highways had 
shrunk. Behind him, other head- 
lights moved into line. Calhoun’s 
car moved away into the dark- 
ness. The others followed. 

Brilliant stars shone overhead. 
A cluster of thousands of suns, a 
hundred light-years away, made 
a center of illumination that gave 
Maya’s night the quality of a 
vivid if diffused moonlight. The 
cars went on. Presently Calhoun 
felt the twitchings of minor mus- 
cular spasms. He was riding into 
the field which had been first de- 
vised for purposes remote from 
the herding of cattle or humans, 
but applied to the first use on the 
planet Texia, and now applied to 
the second here. 

The road became two, and 
then four, and then eight lanes 
wide. Then four lanes swirled off 
to one side, and the remaining 
four presently doubled, and then 
widened again, and it was the 
twelve-lane turnpike that had 
brought Calhoun here from Maya 
City. 

T>UT the rhythmic interference 
with his body grew stronger. 
Allison had spoken not one single 
word while Calhoun conferred 
with the people of Maya beyond 
the highway. His teeth chattered 
as they started back. He didn’t 
attempt to speak during the be- 
ginning of the ride through the 
cattle-fence field. His teeth chat- 

GALAXY 



L 



tered, and stopped, and chattered 
again, and at long last he panted 
despairingly: 

“Are you going to let the thing 
kill me?” 

Calhoun stopped. The cars be- 
hind him stopped. He gave Alli- 
son two pellets and took two him- 
self. With Murgatroyd insistently 
accompanying him, he went along 
the cars which trailed him. He 
made sure the six men he’d asked 
for took their pellets and that 
they had an adequate effect. He 
went back to the sports car. 

Allison whimpered a little 
when he and Murgatroyd got 
back in. 

“I thought,” said Calhoun con- 
versationally, “that you might try 
to take off by yourself, just now. 
It would solve a problem for me. 
Of course it wouldn’t solve any 
for you. But I don’t think your 
problems have any solution, now.” 

He started the car up again. It 
moved forward. The other cars 
trailed dutifully. They went on 
through the starlit night. Calhoun 
noted that the effect of the cattle 
fence was less than it had been 
before. The first desensitizing 
pellets had not wholly lost their 
effect when he added to it. But 
he kept his speed low until he 
was certain the other drivers had 
endured the anguish of passing 
through the cattle-fence field. 

Presently he was confident that 
the cattle field was past. He sent 



his car up to eighty miles an hour. 
The other cars followed faithful- 
ly. To a hundred. They did not 
drop behind. The car hummed 
through the night at top speed — 
a hundred and twenty, a hundred 
and thirty miles an hour. The 
three other cars’ headlights faith- 
fully kept pace with him. 

Allison, said desperately, 
“Look! I — don’t understand 
what’s happened. You talk as if 
I’d planned all this. I — did have 
advance notice of a — a research 
project here. But it shouldn’t 
have held the people there for 
days! Something went wrong! I 
only believed that people would 
want to leave Maya. I’d only 
planned to buy as much acreage 
as I could, and control of as many 
factories as possible. That’s all! It 
was business! Only business!” 

Calhoun did not answer. Alli- 
son might be telling the truth. 
Some businessmen would think it 
only intelligent to frighten people 
into selling their holdings below 
true value. Something of the sort 
happened every day in stock ex- 
changes. But the people of Maya 
could have died! 

For that matter, they still 
might. They couldn’t return to 
their homes and food so long as 
broadcast power kept the cattle- 
fence in existence. But they could 
not return to their homes and 
food supplies if the power broad- 
cast was cut off, either.

Over all the night surface of 
the world of Maya there was light 
only on one highway at one spot, 
and a multitude of smaller, lesser 
lights where the j>eople of Maya 
waited to find out whether they 
would live or die. 

V 

^ALHOUN considered coldly. 
^ They were beyond what had 
been the farthest small city on 
the multiple highway. They 
would go on past now-starlit 
fields of plants native to Maya, 
passing many places where trucks 
loaded with the plants climbed up 
to the roadway and headed for 
the factories which made use of 
them. The fields ran for scores of 
miles along the highway’s length. 
They reached out beyond the ho- 
rizon, — perhaps scores of miles 
in that direction, too. There were 
thousands upon thousands of 
square miles devoted to the grow- 
ing of the dark-green vegetation 
which supplied the raw materials 
for Maya’s space exports. Some 
hundred-odd miles ahead, the 
small town of Tenochitlan lay 
huddled in the light of the distant 
star-cluster' Beyond that, more 
highway and Maya City. Beyond 
that — 

Calhoun reasoned that the pro- 
jector to make the induction cat- 
tle fence would be beyond Maya 
City, somewhere in the mountains 



the photograph in the spaceport 
building showed. A large highway 
went into those mountains for a 
limited distance only. 

A ground-inductor projector 
field always formed at a right 
angle to the projector which was 
its source. It could be adjusted 
— the process was analogous to 
focusing — to come into actual 
being at any distance desired, and 
the distance could be changed. To 
drive the p)eople of Maya City 
eastward, the projector of a cattle 
fence — about which they would 
know nothing; it would be totally 
strange and completely mysteri- 
ous — the projector of the cattle 
fence would need to be west of 
the people to be driven. Logically, 
it would belong in the mountains. 
Practically, it would be con- 
cealed. Drawing on broadcast 
power to do its work, there would 
be no large power source needed 
to give it the six million kilowatts 
it required. It should be quite 
easy to hide beyond any quick 
or easy discovery. Hunting it out 
might require weeks of searching. 

But the people beyond the end 
of the highway couldn’t wait. 
They had no food, and holes 
scrabbled down to ground-water 
by men digging with their bare 
hands simply would not be ade- 
quate. The cattle fence had to be 
cut off immediately — while the 
broadcast of power had to be con- 
tinued. 



188 



GALAXY 



Calhoun made an abrupt grunt- 
ing noise. Phrasing the thing that 
needed to be done was practically 
a blueprint of how to do it. Sim- 
ple! He’d need the two electronics 
engineers, of course. But that 
would be the trick . 

He drove on at a hundred 
thrity miles an hour with his lips 
set wrily. The three other cars 
came behind him. Murgatroyd 
watched the way ahead. Mile 
after mile, half-minute after half- 
minute, the headlights cast bril- 
liantly blinding beams before the 
cars. Murgatroyd grew bored. He 
said, “Chee!” in a discontented 
fashion and tried to curl up be- 
tween Allison and Calhoun. There 
wasn’t room. He crawled over the 
seat-back. He moved about, back 
there. There were rustling sounds. 
He settled down. Presently there 
was silence. Undoubtedly he had 
draped his furry tail across his 
nose and gone soundly off to 
sleep. 

Allison spoke suddenly. He’d 
had time to think, but he had no 
practice in various ways of think- 
ing. 

“How much money' have you 
got?” he asked. 

“Not much,” said Calhoun. 
“Why?” 

“I — haven’t done anything il- 
legal,” said Allison, with an un- 
convincing air of confidence, “but 
I could be put to some inconveni- 
ence if you were to accuse me be- 



fore others of what you’ve ac- 
cused me personally. You seem to 
think that ! planned a criminal 
act. That the action I know of — 
the research project I’d heard of 
— that it became — that it got 
out of hand is likely. But I am 
entirely in the clear. I did noth- 
ing in which I did not have the 
advice of counsel. I am legally 
unassailable. My lawyers — ” 

ii^^HAT’S none of business,” 
Calhoun told him. “I’m a 
medical man. I landed here in the 
middle of what seemed to be a 
serious public health situation. I 
went to see what had happ>ened. 
I’ve found out. I still haven’t the 
answer, — not the whole answer 
an3Tway. But the human popula- 
tion of Maya is in a state of some 
privation, not to say danger. I 
hope to end it. But I’ve nothing 
to do with anybody’s guilt or in- 
nocence of crime or criminal in- 
tent or anything else.” 

Allison swallowed. Then he 
said with smooth confidence: 

“But you could cause me in- 
convenience. I would appreciate 
it if you would — would — ” 
“Cover up what you’ve done?” 
asked Calhoun. 

“No! I’ve done nothing wrong. 
But you could simply use dis- 
cretion. I landed by parachute to 
complete some business deals I’d 
arranged months ago. I will go 
through with them. I will leave on 



MED SHIP MAN 



189 



the next ship. That’s perfectly 
open and above board. Strictly 
business. But you could make a 
^ an unpleasing public image 
of me. Yet I have done nothing 
any other business man wouldn’t 
do! I did happen to know of a 
research project — ” 

“I think,” said Calhoun without 
heat, “that you sent men here 
with a cattle-fence device from 
Texia to frighten the p>eople on 
Maya. They wouldn’t know what 
was going on. They’d be scared; 
they’d want to get away. So you’d 
be able to buy up practically all 
the colony for the equivalent of 
peanuts. I can’t prove that,” he 
conceded, “but that’s my opinion. 
But you want me not to state it. 
Is that right?” 

“Exactly!” said Allison. He’d 
been shaken to the core, but he 
managed the tone and the air of 
a dignified man of business dis- 
cussing an unpleasant subject 
with fine candor. “I assure you 
you are mistaken. You agree that 
you can’t prove your suspicions. 
If you can’t prove them, you 
shouldn’t state them. That is sim- 
ple ethics. You agree to that!” 

Calhoun looked at him curi- 
ously. 

“Are you waiting for me to tell 
you my price?” 

“I’m waiting,” said Allison re- 
provingly, “for you to agree not 
to cause me embarrassment. I 
won’t be ungrateful. After all, I’m 



a person of some influence. I 
could do a great deal to your 
benefit. I’d be glad — ” 

“Are you working around to 
guess at a price I’ll take?” asked 
Calhoun with the same air of 
curiosity. 

He seemed much more curious 
than indignant, and much more 
amused than curious. Allison 
sweated suddenly. Calhoun didn’t 
appear to be bribable. But Allison 
knew desperation. 

“If you want to put it that way 
— yes,” he said harshly. “You can 
name your own figure. I mean it!” 
“I won’t say a word about you,” 
said Calhoun. “I won’t need to. 
The characters who’re op>erating 
your cattle fence will do all the 
talking that’s necessary. Things 
all fit together, — except for one 
item. They’ve been dropping into 
place all the while we’ve been 
driving down this road.” 

“I said you can name your own 
figure!” Allison’s voice was shrill. 
“I mean it! Any figure! Any!” 
Calhoun shrugged. 

“What would a Med Ship man 
do with money? Forget it!” 

He drove on. The highway 
turnoff to Tenochitlan appeared. 
Calhoun went steadily past it. 
The other connection with the 
road through the town apjjeared. 
He left it behind. 

Allison’s teeth chattered again. 
The buildings of Maya City be- 
gan to appear, some twenty min-

utes later. Calhoun slowed and 
the other cars closed up. He 
opened a window and called: 

“We want to go to the landing- 
grid first. Somebody lead the 
way!” 

A car went past and guided 
the rest assuredly to a ramp down 
from the now-elevated road, and 
through utterly dark streets, of 
which some were narrow and 
winding, and came out abruptly 
where the landing-grid rose sky- 
ward. At the bottom its massive 
girders looked huge and Cyclo- 
pean in the starlight, but the 
higher courses looked like silver 
lace against the stars. 

T hey went to the control 
building. Calhoun got out. 
Murgatroyd hopped out after 
him, dust clinging to his fur. He 
shook himself, and a ten-thou- 
sand-credit interstellar credit cer- 
tificate fell to the ground. Murga- 
troyd had made a soft place for 
sleeping out of the contents of 
Allison’s attache case. It was as- 
suredly the most expensive if not 
the most comfortable sleeping 
cushion a tormal ever had. Allison 
sat still as if numbed. He did not 
even pick up the certificate. 

“I need you two electronics 
men,” said Calhoun. Then he said 
apologetically to the others, “I 
only figured out something on the 
way here. I’d believed we might 
have to take some drastic action. 



come daybreak. But now I doubt 
it. I do suggest, though, that you 
turn off the car headlights and 
get set to do some shooting if 
anybody turns up. I don’t know 
whether they will or not.” 

He led the way inside. He 
turned on lights. He went to the 
place where dials showed the 
amount of power actually being 
used of the enormous amount 
available. Those dials now 
showed an extremely small power 
drain, considering that the cities 
of a planet depended on the grid. 
But the cities were dark and emp- 
ty of people. The demand needle 
wavered back and forth, rhyth- 
mically. Every two seconds the 
demand for power went up by 
six million kilowatts, approxi- 
mately. The demand lasted for 
half a second, and stopped. For a 
second and a half the power in 
use was reduced by six million 
kilowatts. During this period only 
automatic pumps and ventilators 
and freezing equipment drew on 
the broadcast power for energy. 
Then the six-million-kilowatt de- 
mand came again for half a sec- 
ond. 

“The cattle fence,” said Cal- 
houn, “works for half a second 
out of every two seconds. It’s in- 
termittent or it would simply 
paralyze animals that wandered 
into it. Or people. Being intermit- 
tent, it drives them out instead. 
There’ll be tools and parts for 



MED SHIP MAN 



191 



equipment here, in case some- 
thing needs repair. I want you to 
make something new.” 

The two electronics technicians 
asked questions. , 

“We need,” said Calhoun, “an 
interrupter that will cut off the 
power broadcast for the half-sec- 
ond the ground-induction field is 
suppKJsed to be on. Then it should 
turn on the broadcast power for 
the second and a half the cattle 
fence is supposed to be off. That 
will stop the cattle-fence effect, 
and I think a ground car should 
be able to work with power that’s 
available for three half-seconds 
out of four.” 

The electronics men blinked at 
him. Then they grinned and set 
to work. Calhoun went exploring. 
He found a lunch box in a desk 
with three very stale sandwiches 
in it. He offered them around. 

It appeared that nobody 
wanted to eat while their families 
— at the end of the highway — 
were still hungry. 

The electronics men called on 
the two mechanics to help build 
something. They explained ab- 
sorbedly to Calhoun that they 
were making a cutoff which 
would adjust to any sudden six- 
million-kilowatt demand, no mat- 
ter what time interval was in- 
volved. A change in the tempo of 
the cattle-fence cycle wouldn’t 
bring it back on. 

“That’s fine!” said Calhoun. “I 



wouldn’t have thought of that!” 

He bit into a stale sandwich 
and went outside. Allison sat 
limply, despairingly, in his seat 
in the car. 

“The cattle fence is going off,” 
said Calhoun without triumph. 
“The people of the city will prob- 
ably begin to get here around 
sunrise.” 

“I — I did nothing legally 
wrong!” said Allison, dry- 
throated. “Nothing! They’d have 
to prove that I knew what the — 
consequences of the research proj- 
ect would be. That couldn’t be 
proved! It couldn’t! So I’ve done 
nothing legally wrong . .” 

Calhoun went inside, observing 
that the doctor who was also ten- 
nis champion, and the policeman 
who’d come to help him, were 
keeping keen eyes on the city and 
the foundations of the grid and 
all other places from which 
trouble might come. 

There was a fine atmosphere 
of achievement in the power-con- 
trol room. The power itself did 
not pass through these instru- 
ments, but relays here controlled 
buried massive conductors which 
supplied the world with power. 
And one of the relays had been 
modified. When the cattle-fence 
projector closed its circuit, the 
power went off. When the ground- 
inductor went off, the power went 
on. There was no longer a barrier 
across the highways leading to 



192 



GALAXY 



the east. It was more than prob- 
able that ground cars could run 
on current supplied for one and a 
half seconds out of every two. 
They might run jerkily, but they 
would run. 

ALF AN HOUR later, the 
amount of power drawn 
from the broadcast began to rise 
smoothly and gradually. It could 
mean only that cars were begin- 
ning to move. 

Forty-five minutes later still, 
Calhoun heard stirrings outside. 
He went out. The two men on 
guard gazed off into the city. 
Something moved there. It was a 
ground-car, running slowly and 
without lights. Calhoun said un- 
disturbedly: 

“Whoever was running the cat- 
tle fence found out their gadget 
wasn’t working. Their lights 
flickered, too. They came to see 
what was the matter at the land- 
ing-grid. But they’ve seen the 
lighted windows. Got your 
blasters handy?” 

But the unlighted car turned 
and raced away. Calhoun only 
shrugged. 

“They haven’t a prayer,” he 
said. “We’ll take over their ap- 
paratus as soon as it’s light. It’ll 
be too big to destroy, and there’ll 
be fingerprints and such to iden- 
tify them as the men who ran it. 
And they’re not natives. When 
the police start to look for the 



strangers who were living where 
the cattle-fence projector was set 
up . They can go into the 
jungles where there’s nothing to 
eat, or they can give themselves 
up.” 

He moved toward the door of 
the control building once more. 
Allison said desperately: 

“They’ll have hidden their 
equipment. You’ll never be able 
to find it!” 

Calhoun shook his head in the 
starlight. 

“Anything that can fly can spot 
it in minutes. Even on the 
ground one can walk almost 
straight to it. You see, something 
happened they didn’t count on. 
That’s why they’ve left it turned 
on at full power. The earlier, 
teasing uses of the cattle fence 
were low-power. Annoying, to 
start with, and uncomfortable the 
second time, and maybe some- 
what painful the third. But the 
last time it was full power.” 

He shrugged. He didn’t feel 
like a long oration. But it was 
obvious. Something had killed 
the plants of a certain genus of 
which small species were weeds 
that destroyed Earth-type grasses. 
The ground-cover plants — and 
the larger ones, like the one Cal- 
houn had seen decaying in a 
florist’s shop which had had to 
be grown in a cage — the ground- 
cover plants had motile stems 
and leaves and blossoms. They

were cannibals. They could move 
their stems to reach, and their 
leaves to enclose, and their flow- 
ers to devour other plants, even 
perhaps small animals. The point, 
though, was that they had some 
limited power of motion. Earth- 
style sensitive vines and flycatch- 
er plants had primitive muscular 
tissues. The local ground-cover 
plants had them too. And the cat- 
tle-fence field made those tissues 
contract spasmodically. Powerful- 
ly. Violently. Repeatedly. Until 
they died of exhaustion. The full- 
power cattle-fence field had ex- 
terminated Mayan ground-cover 
plants all the way to the end of 
the east-bound highway. And 
inevitably — and very conveni- 
ently — also up to the exact spot 
where the cattle-fence field had 
begun to be projected. There 
would be an arrow-shaped nar- 
rowing of the wiped-out ground- 
cover plants where the cattle-field 
had been projected. It would nar- 
row to a point which pointed pre- 
cisely to the cattle-fence project- 
or. 

“Your friends,” said Calhoun, 
“will probably give themselves up 
and ask for mercy. There’s not 
much else they can do.” 

Then he said: 

“They might even get it. D’you 
know, there’s an interesting side 
effect of the cattle fence. It kills 
the plants that have kept earth- 
type grasses from growing here. 



Wheat can be grown here now, 
whenever and as much as the 
people please. It should make 
this a pretty prosperous planet, 
not having to import all its 
bread.” 

ground cars of the inhabit- 
ants of Maya City did begin 
to arrive at sunrise. Within an 
hour after daybreak, very savage- 
ly intent persons found the pro- 
jector and turned it off. 

By noon there was still some 
anger on the faces of the people 
of Maya, but there’d been little 
or no damage, and life took up 
its normal course again. Murga- 
troyd appreciated the fact that 
things went back to normal. For 
him it was normal to be wel- 
comed and petted when the Med 
Ship Esclipus Twenty touched 
ground. It was normal for him to 
move zestfully in admiring hu- 
man society, and to drink coffee 
with great gusto. 

And while Murgatroyd moved 
in human society, enjoying him- 
self hugely, Calhoun went about 
his business. Which, of course, 
was conferences with planetary 
health officials, politely receiving 
such information as they thought 
important, and tactfully telling 
them about the most recent de- 
velopments in medical science. 

What else was a Med Ship 
man for?

12 famous authors start a 
new kind of writing school 



If you have writing talent worth developing, 
here’s an opportunity never before available: 

Twelve of America’s most famous authors 
have created a school of professional writing 
to help you develop your skill, talent and 
craftsmanship , . , and to pass on to you their 
secrets of achieving success and recognition. 

This unique home-training program is su- 
pervised by Rod Serling, winner of five Em- 
mys for TV writing; Pulitzer Prize historian 
Bruce Catton; best-selling novelist Faith 
Baldwin; humorist Max (Dobie Gillis) Shul- 
man; publisher-columnist Bennett Cerf; 
famed sportswriter Red Smith; Rudolf Flesch, 
top authority on readable writing; noted lan- 
guage expert Prof. Bergen Evans; famous 
mystery novelist Mignon G. Eberhart; J. D. 
Ratcliff, called by Time “America’s No. 1 
craftsman in the field of non-fiction"; and 
top ad men John Caples and Mark Wiseman. 

These famous authors have developed a 
remarkable series of textbooks, lessons and 
writing assignments that present — in a clear 
and stimulating way — what they have learned 
in their long, hard climb to the top. 

The School’s instructors are themselves 
professional writers. Under the supervision 
of the 12 Famous Writers, these instructors 
work with students by mail, just as magazine 
and book editors work with many established 
authors. And they spend up to several hours 



on each assignment completed by a student 
. revising, correcting, and advising. 

The Famous Writers School is less than 
three years old. Its first students are not due 
to graduate until later this year. Yet, many 
have sold their writings to such varied publi- 
cations as The Reader’s Digest, Redbook, 
Popular Science, True Story. 

To select people with writing talent worth 
developing, the 12 Famous Writers have de- 
signed a revealing Talent Test. The coupon 
will bring you a copy, along with a brochure 
about the School. Your completed Test will 
be graded without charge or obligation by 
one of the School’s instructors. If your Test 
indicates writing talent, you are then eligible 
to enroll in the School, You are, however, un- 
der absolutely no obligation to do so. 



Famous Writers School 

Dept. 6307, Westport, Connecticut
