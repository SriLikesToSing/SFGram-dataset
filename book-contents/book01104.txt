T et’s say that we get to Mars 
in the next few years and 
learn that, in spite of everything, 
there really are Martians. The 
way we learn this is that our 
spacecraft cushions its soft land- 
ing on a Martian canal-tender’s 
hut; and as a direct consequence 
of this mishap grave events fol- 
low, for all of which the Martian 
government holds us responsible. 
Next thing you know the Presi- 
dent of the United States is sum- 
moned to defend himself before 
the Third Marslaw Folk Concil- 
iatorium. 

Clearly the President needs 
a lawyer — and a space lawyer, 



at that. Where is he going to 
find one? 

As a matter of fact, he won’t 
have very far to look — not by 
the time we land on Mars, and 
indeed not even today. Space 
law is already a recognized spe- 
cialty; the most recent proof of 
this to cross our desk is a fat, 
good-looking volume entitled 
Law and Public Order in Space 
(Yale University Press), written 
by three law professors named 
McDougal, Lasswell and Vlasic. 
(Professors McDougal and Lass- 
well are on the Yale faculty. 
Professor Vlasic, however, shows 
just how far this thing has gone.

Secrets 
entrusted 
to a 
few 



THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
•one- but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
die tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
bets remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

with his academic connection: 
his school is McGill’s Institute 
of Air and Space Law.) 

What is most interesting about 
Law and Public Order in Space 
is that it is not science fiction. It 
is solid law: which means that 
it rests firmly on statute and 
precedent, and although you 
might not think it, both statute 
and precedent exist copiously 
right now. The authors have 
found any number of points of 
law concerning marine vessels 
and aircraft, for example, which 
must clearly apply to Gemiri 
and Vostok as well. How can 
nations determine who owns 
what when Mars is colonized? 
The precedents come from Ant- 
arctica. What happens if there 
are Martians, and they object? A 
whole budget of law on such 
questions as American relations 
with the Apaches give the an- 
swers. The authors of this tome 
have considered nearly as many 
possibilities as Heinlein and Van 
Vogt — and have found legal 
matter concerning everything 
from a collision between orbiting 
satellites to the trick question 
of contact with superintendent 
aliens who wish to send us mis- 
sionaries preaching their One 
True Religion. 

It’s interesting reading. (Quotes 
a number of familiar names as 
authorities, by the way — Arthur 
C. Clarke, Lester del Rey, Willy 



Ley, C. S. Lewis, etc.) Maybe 
we should all start boning up 
right now . 

Tf not on space law, then how 
about the sort of law, or at 
least governmental policy, that 
scientists are making right now? 

What makes us think of that 
is another book, this one called 
Scientists and National Policy 
Making (Columbia University 
Press), a symposium edited by 
Robert Gilpin and Christopher 
Wright on how scientists are 
helping to shape government pol- 
icies today. 

There are plenty of them, 
some 4,000 in that National Bu- 
reau of Standards alone. What 
do they do? Why, they advise, 
mostly. But their advice has 
much force behind it, since it is 
rather clear that most laymen 
don’t — and can’t — know enough 
about certain rather large scien- 
tific questions to be entitled to 
an opinion without such advice. 
This is a step forward — as the 
book points out, in the half- 
century after the National Acad- 
emy of Sciences was founded 
in 1863 it was consulted by the 
War Department on only five 
subjects, including “Tests for the 
Purity of Whiskey” and how to 
preserve paint on Army knap- 
sacks. 

There have been changes since 
then! — FREDERIK POHL

—and, above all, 



I 

B ill never realized that sex was 
the cause of it all. If the 
sun that morning had not been 
burning so warmly in the brassy 
sky of Phigerinadon II, and if he 
had not glimpsed the sugar-white 
and barrel-wide backside of In- 
ga-Maria Calyphigia while she 
bathed in the stream, he might 
have paid more attention to his 
plowing than to the burning 
pressures of heterosexuality. He 
would have driven his furrow to 
the far side of the hill before the 
seductive music sounded along 



don't ask why I 



the road. He might never have 
heard it and his life would have 
been very, very different. But 
he did hear it and dropped the 
handles of the plow that was 
plugged into the robomule, 
turned and gaped. 

It was indeed a fabulous sight 
Leading the parade was a one- 
robot-band, twelve-feet high and 
splendid in its great black busby 
that concealed the hi-fi speakers. 
The golden pillars of its legs 
stamped forward as its thirty ar- 
ticulated arms sawed, plucked 
and fingered at a dazzling variety 
of instruments. Martial music

poured out in wave after inspir- 
ing wave and even Bill’s thick 
peasant feet stirred in their clod- 
hoppers as the shining boots of 
the squad of soldiers crashed 
along the road in perfect unison. 
Medals jingled on the manly 
swell of their scarlet-clad chests. 
And there could certainly be no 
nobler sight in all the world. To 
their rear marched the sergeant, 
gorgeous in his braid and brass, 
thickly clustered medals and rib- 
bons, sword and gun, girdled gut 
and steely eye which sought out 
Bill where he stood gawking over 
the fence. The grizzled head 
nodded in his direction, the 
steel-trap mouth bent into a 
friendly smile and there was a 
conspiratorial wink. Then the 
little legion was past, and hurry- 
ing behind in their wake came a 
huddle of dust- covered ancillary 
robots, hopping and crawling or 
rippling along on treads. As soon 
as these had gone by Bill 
climbed clumsily over the split- 
rail fence and ran after them. 
There were no more than two in- 
teresting events every four years 
here, and he was not going to 
miss what hopefully promised to 
be a third. 

A crowd had already gathered 
in the market square when Bill 
hurried up, and they were lis- 
tening to an enthusiastic band 
concert. The robot hurled itself 
into the glorious measures of 



Star Troopers to the Skies 
Avaunt, and thrashed its way 
through Rockets Rumble and al- 
most demolished itself in the 
tumultuous rhythm of Sappers 
at the Pithead Digging. It pur- 
sued this last tune so strenuously 
that one of its legs flew off, ris- 
ing high into the air, but was 
caught dexterously before it 
could hit the ground and the 
music ended with the robot bal- 
ancing on its remaining leg beat- 
ing time with the detached limb. 
It also, after an ear-fracturing 
peal on the basses, used the leg 
to point across the square to 
where a tri-di screen and re- 
freshment booth had been set 
up. The troopers had vanished 
into the tavern and the recruit- 
ing sergeant stood alone among 
his robots, beaming a welcoming 
smile. 

( t \T ow hear this! Free drinks 
’ for all, courtesy of the 
Emperor, and some lively scenes 
of jolly adventure in distant 
climes to amuse you while you 
sip,” he called in an immense 
and leathery voice. 

Most of the people drifted over, 
Bill in their midst, though a few 
embittered and elderly draft- 
dodgers slunk away between the 
houses. Cooling drinks were 
shared out by a robot with a 
spigot for a navel and an inex- 
haustible supply of plastic

GALAXY 



glasses in one metallic hip. 

Bill sipped his happily while 
he followed the enthralling ad- 
ventures of the space troopers 
in full color with sound effects 
and stimulating subsonics. There 
was battle and death and glory 
though it was only the Chingers 
who died: troopers only suffered 
neat little wounds in their ex- 
tremities that could be covered 
easily by small bandages. And 
while Bill was enjoying this. Re- 
cruiting Sergeant Grue was en- 
joying him, his little piggy eyes 
ruddy with greed as they fas- 
tened onto the back of Bill’s 
neck. 

This is the one! he chortled to 
himself while, unknowingly, his 
yellowed tongue licked at his 
lips. He could already feel the 
weight of the bonus money in 
his pocket. The rest of the au- 
dience were the usual mixed bag 
of overage men, fat women, 
beardless youths and other un- 
enlistables. All except this broad- 
shouldered, square-chinned, cur- 
ly-haired chunk of electronic- 
cannon fodder. With a precise 
hand on the controls the sergeant 
lowered the background sub- 
sonics and aimed a tight-beam 
stimulator at the back of his 
victim’s head. Bill writhed in 
his seat, almost taking part in 
the glorious battles unfolding be- 
fore him. 

As the last chord died and the 



screen went blank the refresh- 
ment robot pounded hollowly on 
its metallic chest and bellowed 
DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! The 
sheeplike audience swept that 
way, all except Bill who was 
plucked from their midst by a 
powerful arm. 

“Here, I saved some for you,” 
the sergeant said, passing over 
a prepared cup so loaded with 
dissolved ego-reducing drugs that 
they were crystallizing out at 
the bottom. “You’re a fine fig- 
ure of a lad and to my eye seem 
a cut above the yokels here. Did 
you ever think of making your 
career in the forces?” 

“I’m not the military type, 
shargeant . .” Bill chomped his 
jaws and spat to remove the im- 
pediment to his speech, puzzled 
at the sudden fogginess in his 
thoughts. Though it was a trib- 
ute to his physique that he was 
even conscious after the volume 
of drugs and sonics that he had 
been plyed with. “Not the mili- 
tary type. My fondest ambition 
is to be of help in the best way 
I can, in my chosen career as a 
Technical Fertilizer Operator 
and I’m almost finished with my 
correspondence course . .” 

ttnphat’s a crappy job for a 
bright lad like you,” the 
sergeant said while clapping him 
on the arm to get a good feel 
of his biceps. Rock. He resisted 



THE STARSLOGGERS

the impulse to pull Bill’s lip 
down and take a quick peek at 
the condition of his back teeth. 
Later. “Leave that kind of job 
to those that like it. No chance 
of promotion. While a career in 
the troopers has no top. Why 
Grand-Admiral Pflunger came 
upthrough the rocket tubes, as 
they say, from recruit trooper 
to grand-admiral. How does that 
sound?” 

“It sounds very nice for Mr. 
Pflunger but I think fertilizer 
operating is more fun. Gee — I’m 
feeling sleepy. I think I’ll go lie 
down.” 

“Not before you’ve seen this, 
just as a favor to me of course,” 
the sergeant said, cutting in front 



of him and pointing to a large 
book held open by a tiny robot. 
“Clothes make the man and most 
men would be ashamed to be 
seen in a crummy looking smock 
like that thing draped around 
you or wearing those broken 
canal boats on their feet. Why 
look like that when you can look 
like this?" 

Bill’s eyes followed the thick 
finger to the color plate in the 
book where a miracle of mis- 
applied engineering caused his 
own face to appear on the illus- 
trated figure dressed in trooper- 
red. The sergeant flipped the 
pages and on each plate the uni- 
form was a little more gaudy, 
the rank higher. The last one 



10 



GALAXY 




was that of a grand-admiral and 
Bill blinked at his own face un- 
der the plumed helmet, now with 
a touch of crowfeet about the 
eyes and sporting a handsome 
and gray-shot moustache, but 
still undeniably his own. 

“That’s the way you will 
look,” the sergeant murmured 
into his ear, “once you have 
climbed the ladder of success. 
Would you like to try a uniform 
on? Of course you would like 
to try a uniform on. Tailor!” 

When Bill opened his mouth 
to protest the sergeant put a 
large cigar into it, and before he 
could get it out the robot tailor 
had rolled up, swept a curtain 
bearing arm about him and 



stripped him naked. “Hey! 
Hey . .!” he said. 

“It won’t hurt,” the sergeant 
said, poking his great head 
through the curtain and beaming 
at Bill’s muscled form. He poked 
a finger into a pectoral (rock) 
and then withdrew. 

tt/"vuch!” Bill said as the 
^ ' tailor extruded a cold 
pointer and jabbed him with it, 
measuring his size. Something 
went chunk deep inside its tub- 
ular torso and a brilliant red 
jacket began to emerge from a 
slot in the front. In an instant 
this was slipped onto Bill and 
the shining golden buttons but- 
toned. Luxurious gray moleskin 



THE STARSLOGGERS

trousers were pulled on next, 
then gleaming black knee-length 
boots. Bill staggered a bit as the 
curtain was whipped away and 
a powered full-length mirror 
rolled up. 

“Oh how the girls love a uni- 
form,” the sergeant said, “and I 
can’t blame them.” 

A memory of the vision of 
Inga-Maria Calyphigia’s matched 
white moons obscured Bill’s sight 
for a moment, and when it had 
cleared he found he was grasp- 
ing a stylo and was about to 
sign the form that the recruiting 
sergeant held before him. 

“No,” Bill said, a little amazed 
at his own firmness of mind. “I 
don’t really want to. Technical 
Fertilizer Operator . .” 

“And not only will you receive 
this lovely uniform, an enlist- 
ment bonus and a free medical 
examination, but you will be 
awarded these handsome med- 
als.” The sergeant took a flat 
box, offered to him on cue by a 
robot, and opened it to display a 
glittering array of ribbons and 
bangles. “This is the Honorable 
Enlistment Award,” he intoned 
gravely, pinning a jewel-encrust- 
ed nebula, pendant on chartreuse, 
to Bill’s wide chest. “And the 
Emperor’s Congratulatory Gilded 
Horn, The Forward to Victory 
Starburst, the Praise Be Given 
Salutation of the Mothers of the 
Victorious Fallen and the Ever- 



flowing Cornucopia which does 
not mean anything but it looks 
nice and can be used to carry 
contraceptives.” He stepped back 
and admired Bill’s chest which 
was now adangle with ribbons, 
shining metal and gleaming paste 
gems. 

“I just couldn’t,” Bill said. 
“Thank you anyway for the of- 
fer, but . .” 

The sergeant smiled, prepared 
even for this eleventh hour re- 
sistance, and pressed the button 
on his belt that actuated the 
programmed hypno-coil in the 
heel of Bill’s new boot. The pow- 
erful neural current surged 
through the contacts and Bill’s 
hand twitched and jumped, and 
when the momentary fog had 
lifted from his eyes he saw that 
he had signed his name. 

“But . ” 

C4'lX7'elcome to the Space 
^ ’ Troopers,” the sergeant 
boomed, smacking him on the 
back (trapezius like rock) and 
relieving him of the stylo. “FALL 
IN!” in a larger voice, and the 
recruits stumbled from the tav- 
ern. 

“What have they done to my 
son!” Bill’s mother screeched, 
coming into the market square, 
clutching at her bosom with one 
hand and towing his baby broth- 
er Charlie with the other. Char-

GALAXY 



lie began to cry and wet his 
pants. 

“Your son is now a trooper for 
the greater glory of the Emper- 
or,” the sergeant said, pushing 
his slack-jawed and round-shoul- 
dered recruit squad into line. 

“No! it can’t be . .” Bill’s 
mother sobbed, tearing at her 
graying hair. “I’m a poor widow 
he’s my sole support . you 
cannot . .!” 

“Mother . .” Bill said, but 
the sergeant shoved him back 
into the ranks. 

“Be brave, madam,” he said 
humbly. 

“There can be no greater glory 
for a mother.” He dropped a 
large newly minted coin into her 
hand. “Here is the enlistment 
bonus, the Emperor’s shilling. I 
know he wants you to have it. 
ATTENTION!” 

With a clash of heels the grace- 
less recruits braced their shoul- 
ders and lifted their chins. Much 
to his surprise, so did Bill. 

“RIGHT TURN!” 

In a single, graceful motion 
as the command robot relayed 
the order to the hypno-coil in 
every boot. FORWARD 
MARCH! and they did in per- 
fect rhythm, so well under con- 
trol that, try as hard as he could 
Bill could neither turn his head 
nor wave a last good-by to his 
mother. She vanished behind 
him and one last, anguished wail 



cut through the thud of march- 
ing feet. 

“Step up the count to 130,” the 
sergeant ordered, glancing at the 
watch which was set under the 
nail of his little finger. “Just ten 
miles to the station and we’ll be 
in camp tonight, my lads.” 

The command robot moved its 
metronome up one notch and the 
tramping boots conformed to the 
smarter pace and the men be- 
gan to sweat. By the time they 
had reached the copter station 
it was nearly dark, their red 
paper uniforms hung in shreds, 
the gilt had been rubbed from 
their potmetal buttons and the 
surface charge that repelled the 
dust from their thin plastic 
boots had leaked away. They 
looked as ragged, weary, dusty 
and miserable as they felt. 

II 

I t wasn’t the recorded bugle 
playing reveille that woke 
Bill, but the supersonics that 
streamed through the metal 
frame of his bunk that shook him 
until the fillings vibrated from his 
teeth. He sprang to his feet and 
stood there shivering in the gray 
of dawn. Because it was summer 
the floor was refrigerated : no 
mollycoddling of the men in 
Camp Leon Trotsky. The pallid, 
chilled figures of the other re- 
cruits loomed up on every side. 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



13 



When the soul-shaking vibrations 
died away they dragged their 
thick sackcloth and sandpaper 
fatigue uniforms from their 
bunks, pulled them hastily on, 
jammed their feet into the great, 
purple recruit boots and stag- 
gered out into the dawn. 

“I am here to break your 
spirit,” a voice, rich with men- 
ace, told them, and they looked 
up and shivered even more as 
they faced the chief demon in 
this particular hell. 

Petty Chief Officer Deathwish 
Drang was a specialist from the 
tips of the angry spikes of his 
hair to the corrugated stamping 
soles of his mirror-like boots. He 
was wide shouldered and lean 
hipped, while his long arms hung, 
curved like some horrible an- 
thropoid, the knuckles of his im- 
mense fists scarred from the 
merciless breaking of thousands 
of teeth. 

It was impossible to look at 
this detestable form and imagine 
that it issued from the tender 
womb of a woman. He could 
never been born; he must have 
been built to order by the gov- 
ernment. Most terrible of all 
was the head. The face! The 
hairline was scarcely a fingers- 
width above the black tangle of 
the brows that were set like a 
rank growth of foliage at the rim 
of the black pits that concealed 
the eyes — visible only as baleful 



red gleams in the stygian dark- 
ness. A nose, broken and crushed, 
squatted above the mouth that 
was like a knife slash in the taut 
belly of a corpse, while from be- 
between the lips issued the great, 
white fangs of the canine teeth, 
at least two inches long, that 
rested in grooves on the lower 
lip. 

“I am Petty Chief Officer 
Deathwish Drang and you will 
call me ‘sir’ or ‘m’lord’.” He be- 
gan to pace grimly before the 
row of terrified recruits. “I am 
your father and your mother and 
your whole universe and your 
dedicated enemy, and very soon 
I will have you regretting the 
day you were bom. I will crush 
your will. When I say frog you 
will jump. My job is to turn you 
into troopers, and troopers have 
discipline. Discipline simply 
means unthinking subservience, 
loss of free will, absolute obed- 
ience. That is all I ask . .” 

T Te stopped before Bill, who 
was not shaking quite as 
much as the other recruits and 
scowled. 

“I don’t like your face. One 
month of Sunday KP.” 

“Sir . .” 

“And a second month for talk- 
ing back.” 

He waited, but Bill was silent 
He had already learned his first 
lesson on how to be a good 



14 



GALAXY 



trooper. Keep your mouth shut. 
Death wish paced on. 

“Right now you are nothing 
but horrible, sordid, flabby pieces 
of debased civilian flesh. I shall 
turn that flesh to muscle, your 
wills to jelly, your minds to ma- 
chines. You will become good 
troopers or I will kill you. Very 
soon you will be hearing stories 
about me, vicious stories about 
how I killed and ate a recruit 
who disobeyed me.” 

He halted and stared at them. 
Slowly the coffin-lid lips parted 
in an evil travesty of a grin, while 
a drop of saliva formed at the 
tip of each whitened tusk. 

“That story is true.” 

A moan broke from the row of 
recruits and they shook as 
though a chill wind had passed 
over them. The smile vanished. 

“We will run to breakfast now 
as soon as I have some volun- 
teers for an easy assignment. Can 
any of you drive a helicar?” 

Two recruits hopefully raised 
their hands and he beckoned 
them forward. “Alright, both of 
you, mops and buckets behind 
that door. Clean out the latrine 
while the rest are eating. You’ll 
have a better appetite for 
lunch.” 

That was Bill’s second lesson 
on how to be a good trooper: 
never volunteer. 

The days of recruit training 
passed with a horribly lethargic 



speed. With each day conditions 
became worse and Bill’s exhaus- 
tion greater. This seemed impos- 
sible, but it was nevertheless 
true. A large number of gifted 
and sadistic minds had designed 
it to be that way. The recruits' 
heads were shaved for uniformity 
and their genitalia painted with 
orange antiseptic to control the 
endemic crotch crickets. The 
food was theoretically nourishing 
but incredibly vile and when, by 
mistake, one batch of meat was 
served in an edible state it was 
caught at the last moment and 
thrown out and the cook reduced 
two grades. Their sleep was bro- 
ken by mock gas attacks and 
their free time filled with caring 
for their equipment. 

nphe seventh day was designa- 
■*- ted as a day of rest but they 
all had received punishments, 
like Bill’s KP, and it was as any 
other day. On this, the third 
Sunday of their imprisonment, 
they were stumbling through 
the last hour of the day before 
the lights were extinguished and 
they were finally permitted to 
crawl into their casehardened 
bunks. Bill pushed against the 
weak force field that blocked 
the door, cunningly designed to 
allow the desert flies to enter 
but not leave the barracks, and 
dragged himself in. After four- 
teen hours of KP his legs vibra-

ted with exhaustion and his arms 
were wrinkled and pallid as a 
corpse’s from the soapy water. 
He dropped his jacket to the 
floor, where it stood stiffly, sup- 
ported by its burden of sweat, 
grease and dust, and dragged his 
shaver from the foot locker. In 
the latrine he bobbed his head 
around trying to find a clear 
space on one of the mirrors. 

All of them had been heavily 
stenciled in large letters with 
such inspiring messages as KEEP 
YOUR WUG SHUT — THE 
CHINGERS ARE LISTENING 
and IF YOU TALK THIS MAN 
MAY DIE. He finally plugged 
the shaver in next to WOULD 
YOU WANT YOUR SISTER 
TO MARRY ONE? and center- 
ed his face in the O in ONE. 
Black-rimmed, bloodshot eyes 
stared back at him as he ran 
the buzzing machine over the 
underweight planes of his jaw. 
It took more than a minute for 
the meaning of the question to 
pentrate his fatigue-drugged 
brain. 

“I haven’t got a sister,” he 
grumbled peevishly. “And if I 
did why should she want to 
marry a lizard anyway?” It was 
a rhetorical question but it 
brought an answer from the far 
end of the room, from the last 
shot tower in the second row. 

“It doesn’t mean exactly what 
it says — it’s just there to make 

16 



us hate the dirty enemy more.” 

Bill jumped, he had thought he 
was alone in the latrine, and the 
razor buzzed spitefully and 
gouged a bit of flesh from his 
lip. 

“Who’s there? Why are you 
hiding?” he snarled, then recog- 
nized the huddled dark figure 
and the many pairs of boots. “Oh, 
it’s only you Eager.” His anger 
drained away and he turned back 
to the mirror. 

Eager Beager was so much a 
part of the latrine that you forgot 
he was there. A moon-faced, 
eternally smiling youth whose 
apple red cheeks never lost their 
glow, and whose smile looked 
so much out of place here in 
Camp Leon Trotsky that every- 
one wanted to kill him until they 
remembered that he was mad. 

TTe had to be mad because he 

-*■ was always eager to help his 
buddies and had volunteered as 
permanent latrine orderly. Not 
only that, but he liked to polish 
boots and had offered to do those 
of one after another of his bud- 
dies until now he did the boots 
for every man in the squad every 
night. Whenever they were in 
the barracks Eager Beager could 
be found crouched at the end of 
the thrones that were his per- 
sonal domain, surrounded by 
heaps of shoes and polishing in- 
dustriously, his face wreathed in 



GALAXY 



smiles. He would still be there 
after lights-out, working by the 
light of a burning wick struck in 
a can of polish and was usually 
up before the others in the morn- 
ing, finishing his voluntary job 
and still smiling. Sometimes, 
when the boots were very dirty, 
he worked right through the 
night. The kid was obviously in- 
sane but no one turned him in 
because he did such a good job 
on the boots and they all prayed 
that he wouldn’t die of exhaus- 
tion until recruit training was 
finished. 

“Well if that’s what they want 
to say, why don’t they just say 
‘hate the dirty enemy more’,” 
Bill complained. He jerked his 
thumb at the far wall where 
there was a poster labeled 
KNOW THE ENEMY. It fea- 
tured a life-size illustration of a 
Chinger, a seven foot high sauri- 
an that looked very much like a 
scale covered, four armed, green 
kangaroo with an alligator’s 
head. “Whose sister would want 
to marry a thing like that any- 
way? And what would a thing 
like that want to do with a sis- 
ter, except maybe eat her?” 

Eager put a last buff on a pur- 
ple toe and picked up another 
boot. He frowned for a brief in- 
stant to show what a serious 
thought this was. “Well you see, 
gee — it doesn’t mean a real sis- 
ter. It’s just part of psychological 



warfare. We have to win the war. 
To win the war we have to fight 
hard. In order to fight hard we 
have to have good soldiers. Good 
soldiers have to hate the enemy. 
That’s the way it goes. The 
Chingers are the only non-hu- 
man race that has been discover- 
ed in the galaxy that has gone 
beyond the aboriginal level, so 
naturally we have to wipe them 
out.” 

“What the hell do you mean 
naturally ? I don’t want to wipe 
anyone out. I just want to go 
home and be a Technical Fertili- 
zer Operator.” 

Cfl TC7'ell I don’t mean you per- 
’ ’ sonally, of course — 
gee!” Eager opened a fresh can 
of polish with purple -stained 
hands and dug his fingers into it. 
“I mean the human race, that’s 
just the way we do things. If we 
don’t wipe them out they’ll wipe 
us out. Of course they say that 
war is against their religion and 
they will only fight in defense, 
and they have never made at- 
tacks, yet. But we can’t believe 
them even though it is true. They 
might change their religion or 
their minds some day and then 
where would we be? The best 
answer is to wipe them out now.” 

Bill unplugged his razor and 
washed his face in the tepid, rus- 
ty water. “It still doesn’t seem 
to make sense. Alright, so the

sister I don’t have doesn’t marry 
one of them. But how about that 

— ” he pointed to the stenciling 
on the duckboards, KEEP THIS 
SHOWER CLEAR — THE 
ENEMY CAN HEAR. “Or that 

— ” The sign above the urinal 
that read BUTTON FLIES — 
BEWARE SPIES. “Forgetting 
for the moment that we don’t 
have any secrets here worth 
traveling a mile to hear, much 
less twenty-five light-years — 
how could a Chinger possibly be 
a spy? What kind of make-up 
would disguise a seven foot liz- 
ard as a recruit? You couldn’t 
even disguise one to look like 
Deathwish Drang, though you 
could get pretty close — ” 

The lights went out and, as 
though using his name had sum- 
moned him like a devil from the 
pit, the voice of Deathwish blast- 
ed through the barracks. 

“Into your sacks! Into your 
sacks! Don’t you lousy bowbs 
know there’s a war on!” he 
rumbled menacingly. 

Bill stumbled away through 
the darkness of the barracks 
where the only illumination was 
the red glow from Deathwish’s 
eyes. He fell asleep the instant 
his head touched his carborun- 
dum pillow and it seemed that 
only a moment had elapsed be- 
fore reveille sent him hurtling 
from his bunk. 

At breakfast, while he was 



painfully cutting his coffee-sub- 
stitute into chunks small enough 
to swallow, the telenews reported 
heavy fighting in the Beta Lyra 
sector with mounting losses. A 
groan ripples through the mess 
hall when this was announced, 
not because of any excess of pat- 
riotism, but because any bad 
news would only make things 
worse for them. They did not 
know how this would be ar- 
ranged, but they were positive it 
would be. They were right. 

Oince the morning was a bit 
^ cooler than usual the Mon- 
day parade was postponed until 
noon when the ferro- concrete 
drill ground would have warmed 
up nicely and there would be 
the maximum number of heat 
prostration cases. But this was 
just the beginning. From where 
Bill stood at attention near the 
rear he could see that the air- 
conditioned canopy was up on 
the reviewing stand. That meant 
brass. The trigger guard of his 
atomic rifle dug a hole into his 
shoulder and a drop of sweat 
collected then dripped from the 
tip of his nose. Out of the corn- 
ers of his eyes he could see the 
steady ripple of motion as men 
collapsed here and there among 
the massed ranks of thousands, 
and were dragged to the waiting 
ambulances by alert corpsmen. 
Here they were laid in the shade 



38

of the vehicles until they revived 
and could be urged back to their 
positions in the formation with 
other staggering recruits. 

Then the band burst into 
Spacemen Ho and Chingers 
V anguished! and the broadcast 
signal to each boot heel snapped 
the ranks to attention at the 
same instant and the thousands 
of rifles flashed in the sun. The 
commanding general’s staff car 
— this was obvious from the two 
stars painted on it — pulled up 
beside the reviewing stand and a 
tiny, round figure moved quickly 
through the fumacelike air to 
the comfort of the enclosure. Bill 
had never seen him any closer 
than this, at least from the front, 
though once while he was re- 
turning from late KP he had 
spotted the general getting into 
his car near the camp theatre. 
At least Bill thought it was him, 
but all he had seen was a brief 
rear view. Therefore, if he had a 
mental picture of the general, it 
was of a large backside super- 
imposed on a teeny ant-like 
figure. 

He thought of most officers in 
these general terms, since the 
men of course had nothing to do 
with officers during their recruit 
training. Bill had had a good 
glimpse of a 2nd lieutenant once, 
near the orderly room, and he 
knew he had a face. And there 
had been a medical officer who 



hadn’t been more than thirty 
yards away, who had lectured 
them on venereal disease, but Bill 
had been lucky enough to sit be- 
hind a post and had promptly 
fallen asleep. 

After the band shut up, the 
anti-G loudspeakers floated out 
over the troops and the general 
addressed them. He had nothing 
to say that anyone cared to listen 
to and he closed with the an- 
nouncement that because of 
losses in the field their training 
program would be accelerated, 
which was just what they had 
expected. Then the band played 
some more and they marched 
back to the barracks, changed 
into their haircloth fatigues and 
marched — doubletime now — 
to the range where they fired 
their atomic rifles at plastic re- 
plicas of Chingers that popped 
up out of holes in the ground. 
Their aim was very bad until 
Deathwish Drang popped out of 
a hole and every trooper switch- 
ed to full automatic and hit with 
every charge fired from every 
gun, which is a very hard thing 
to do. Then the smoke cleared 
and they stopped cheering and 
started sobbing when they saw 
that it was only a plastic replica 
of Deathwish, now tom to tiny 
pieces, and the original appeared 
behind them and gnashed its 
tusks and gave them all a full 
month’s KP.

tt'T'he human body is a won- 
derful thing,” Bowb Brown 
said, a month later, when they 
were sitting around a table in the 
Lowest Ranks Klub eating plas- 
tic skinned sausages stuffed with 
road sweepings and drinking 
watery warm beer. Bowb Brown 
was a thoatherder from the 
plains, which is why they called 
him Bowb since everyone knows 
just what thoatherders do with 
their thoats. He was tall, thin 
and bowlegged, his skin burnt 
to the color of ancient leather. 
He rarely talked, being more 
used to the eternal silence of 
the plains broken only by the 
eerie cry of the restless thoat. 
He was a great thinker since the 
one thing he had had plenty of 
was time to think in. He could 
worry a thought for days, even 
weeks, before he mentioned it 
aloud, and while he was thinking 
about it nothing could disturb 
him. He even let them call him 
Bowb without protesting : call any 
other trooper bowb and he 
would hit you in the face. Bill 
and Eager and the other troopers 
from X squad sitting around the 
table all clapped and cheered, 
as they always did when Bowb 
said something. 

“Tell us more, Bowb!” 

“It can still talk — I thought 
it was deadl” 

20 



“Go on — why is the body a 
wonderful thing?” 

They waited in expectant si- 
lence while Bowb managed to 
tear a bite from his sausage and, 
after ineffectual chewing, swal- 
lowed it with an effort that 
brought tears to his eyes. He 
eased the pain with a mouthful 
of beer and spoke. 

“The human body is a wonder- 
ful thing — because if it doesn’t 
die — it lives.” 

They waited for more until 
they realized that he was fin- 
ished, then they sneered. 

“Boy, are you full of bowb!” 
“Sign up for O.C.S.!” 

“Yeah — but what does it 
mean?” 

Bill knew what it meant, but 
didn’t tell them. 

There were only half as many 
men in the squad as there had 
been the first day. One man had 
been transferred. All the others 
were sick or in the mental hos- 
pital, or discharged for the con- 
venience of the government as 
being too crippled for active ser- 
vice. Or dead. The survivors, 
after losing every ounce of 
weight not made up of bone or 
essential connective tissue, Rad 
put back the lost weight in the 
form of muscle and were now 
completely adapted to the rigors 
of Camp Leon Trotsky, though 
they still loathed it. 

Bill marveled at the efficiency 

GALAXY 



of the system. Civilians had to 
fool around with examinations, 
grades, retirement benefits, se- 
niority and a thousand other fac- 
tors that limited the efficiency 
of the workers. But how easily 
the troopers did it! They simply 
killed off the weaker ones and 
used the survivors. He respected 
the system. Though he still loath- 
ed it. 

tCVTou know what I need, I 
- •* need a woman,” Ugly 
Ugglesway said. 

“Don’t talk dirty,” Bill told 
him promptly, since he had been 
brought up correctly. 

“I’m not talking dirty!” Ugly 
whined. “It’s not like I said I 
wanted to re-enlist or that I 
thought Deathwish was human or 
anything like that. I just said I 
need a woman. Don’t we all?” 
“I need a drink,” Bowb Brown 
said as he took a long swig from 
his glass of dehydrated reconsti- 
tuted beer, shuddered, then 
squirted it out through his teeth 
in a long stream onto the con- 
crete, where it instantly evapora- 
ted. 

“Affirm, affirm,” Ugly agreed, 
bobbing his mat-haired warty 
head up and down. “I need a 
woman and a drink.” His whine 
became almost plaintive. “After 
all, what else is there to want in 
the troopers outside of out?” 
They thought about that a 



long time, but could think of 
nothing else that anyone really 
wanted. Eager Beager looked out 
from under the table where he 
was surreptitiously polishing a 
boot and said that he wantetd 
more polish, but they ignored 
him. Even Bill, now that he put 
his mind to it, could think of 
nothing he really wanted other 
than this inextricably linked pair. 
He tried hard to think of some- 
thing else, since he had vague 
memories of wanting other things 
when he had been a civilian, but 
nothing else came to mind. 

“Gee, it’s only seven more 
weeks until we get our first pass,” 
Eager said from under the table, 
then screamed as everyone kick- 
ed him at once. 

But slow as subjective time 
crawled by, the objective clocks 
were still operating and the seven 
weeks did pass by and eliminate 
themselves one by one. Busy 
weeks filled with all the essen- 
tial recruit training courses: 
bayonet drill, small arms train- 
ing, short arm inspection, grey- 
pfing, orientation lectures, drill, 
communal singing and the Ar- 
ticles of War. These last were 
read with dreadful regularity 
twice a week and were absolute 
torture because of the intense 
somnolence they brought on. 

At the first rustle of the 
scratchy, monotonous voice from 
the tape player heads would be-

gin to nod. But every seat in 
the auditorium was wired with 
an EEG that monitored the 
brain waves of the captive 
troopers. As soon as the shape 
of the Alpha wave indicated 
transition from consciousness to 
slumber a powerful jolt of cur- 
rent would be shot into the doz- 
ing buttocks, jabbing the owner 
painfully awake. 

The musty auditorium was a 
dimly lit torture chamber, filled 
with the droning dull voice punc- 
tuated by the sharp screams of 
the electrified, the sea of nodding 
heads abob here and there with 
painfully leaping figures. 

VTo one ever listened to the 

’ terrible executions and 
sentences announced in the Ar- 
ticles for the most innocent of 
crimes. Everyone knew that they 
had signed away all human rights 
when they enlisted. The itemiz- 
ing of what they had lost inter- 
ested them not in the slightest. 
What they really were interested 
in was counting the hours until 
they would receive their first 
pass. 

The ritual by which this re- 
ward was begrudgingly given was 
unusually humiliating, but they 
expected this and merely lower- 
ed their eyes and shuffled for- 
ward in the line, ready to sacri- 
fice any remaining shards of their 
self-respect in exchange for the 



crimpled scrap of plastic. ms 
rite finished, there was a scram- 
ble for the monorail train whose 
track ran on electrically charged 
pillers, soaring over the thirty- 
foot high barbed wire, crossing 
the quicksand beds, then drop- 
ping into the little farming town 
of Leyville. 

At least it had been an agricul- 
tural town before Camp Leon 
Trotsky had been built and 
sporadically, in the hours when 
the troopers weren’t on leave, 
it followed its original agrarian 
bent. The rest of the time the 
grain and feed stores shut down 
and the drink and knock shops 
opened. Many times the same 
premises were used for both 
functions. A lever would be 
pulled when the first of the leave 
party thundered out of the sta- 
tion and grain bins became beds, 
salesclerks pimps, cashiers re- 
tained their same function — 
though the prices went up — 
while counters would be racked 
with glasses to serve as bars. It 
was to one of these establish- 
ments, a mortuary-cum-saloon, 
that Bill and his friends went. 

“What’ll it be, boys?” the 
ever-smiling owner of the Final 
Resting Bar and Grill asked. 

“Double shot of embalming 
fluid,” Bowb Brown told him. 

“No jokes,” the landlord said, 
the smile vanishing for a second 
as he took down a bottle on 



22 



GALAXY 



which the garish label REAL 
WHISKY had been pasted over 
the etched in EMBALMING 
FLUID. “Any trouble I call the 
MPs.” The smile returned as 
money struck the counter. “Name 
your poison, gents.” 

They sat around a long, nar- 
row table as thick as it was wide 
with brass handles on both sides, 
and let the blessed relief of 
ethyl alcohol trickle a path down 
their dust-lined throats. 

“I never drank before I came 
into the service,” Bill said, drain- 
ing four fingers neat of Old Kid- 
ney Killer and held his glass 
out for more. 

ttX/'ou never had to,” Ugly 
* said, pouring. 

“That’s for sure,” Bowb Brown 
said, smacking his lips with relish 
and raising a bottle to his lips 
again. 

“Gee,” Eager Beager said, sip- 
ping hesitantly at the edge of 
his glass, “It tastes like a tinc- 
ture of sugar, wood chips, vari- 
ous esters and a number of high- 
er alcohbls.” 

“Drink up,” Bowb said in- 
coherently around the neck of 
the bottle- “All them things is 
good for you.” 

“Now I want a woman,” Ugly 
said and there was a rush as they 
all jammed in the door trying to 
get out at the same time, until 
someone shouted Look! and they 



turned to see Eager still sitting 
at the table. 

“Woman!” Ugly said enthu- 
siastically, in the tone of voice 
you say Dinner! in when you are 
calling a dog. The knot of men 
stirred in the doorway and 
stamped their feet. Eager didn’t 
move. 

“Gee — I think I’ll stay right 
here,” he said, his smile simpler 
than ever. “But you guys run 
along.” 

“Don’t you feel well. Eager?” 

“Feel fine.” 

“Ain’t you reached puberty?” 

“Gee . ” 

“What you gonna do here?” 

Eager reached under the table 
and dragged out a canvas grip. 
He opened it to show that it 
was packed with great, purple 
boots. “I thought I’d catch up on 
my polishing.” 

They walked slowly down the 
wooden sidewalk, silent for the 
moment. “I wonder if there is 
something wrong with Eager?” 
Bill asked, but no one answered 
him. They were looking down the 
rutted street, at a brilliantly illu- 
minated sign that cast a tempt- 
ing, ruddy glow. 

SPACEMEN’S REST it said. 
CONTINUOUS STRIP SHOW 
and BEST DRINKS and better 
PRIVATE ROOMS FOR 
GUESTS AND THEIR 
FRIENDS. They walked faster. 
The front wall of the Space-

man’s Rest was covered with 
shatterproof glass cases filled 
with tri-di pix of the fully dress- 
ed (bangle and double stars) en- 
tertainers, and further in with 
pix of them nude (debangled 
with fallen stars). Bill stayed the 
quick sound of panting by point- 
ing to a small sign almost lost 
among the tumescent wealth of 
mammaries. 

OFFICERS ONLY it read. 

“Move along,” an MP grated 
and poked at them with his elec- 
tronic nightstick. They shuffled 

on. 

r T~'he next establishment admit- 
ted men of all classes, but 
the cover charge was 77 credits, 
more than they all had between 
them. After that the OFFICERS 
ONLY began again until the 
pavement ended and all the 
lights were behind them. 

“What’s that?” Ugly asked at 
the sound of murmured voices 
from a nearby darkened street. 
Peering closely they saw a line 
of troopers that stretched out of 
sight around a distant corner. 
“What’s this?” he asked the last 
man in the line. 

, “Lower ranks cathouse. Two 
credits, two minutes. And don’t 
try to buck the line, bowb. On 
the back, on the back.” 

They joined up instantly and 
Bill ended up last, but not for 
long. They shuffled forward slow- 



ly and other troopers appeared 
and cued up behind him. The 
night was cool and he took many 
life-preserving slugs from his bot- 
tle. There was little conversation 
and what there was died as the 
red-lit portal loomed ever closer. 
It opened and closed at regular 
intervals and one by one Bill’s 
buddies slipped in to partake of 
its satisfying, though rapid, pleas- 
ures. Then it was his turn and 
the door started to open and he 
started to step forward. Sudden- 
ly sirens started screaming and 
a large MP with a great fat belly 
jumped between Bill and the 
door. 

“Emergency recall. Back to the 
base you men!” it barked. 

Bill howled a strangled groan 
of frustration and leaped for- 
ward, but a light tap with the 
electronic nightstick sent him 
reeling back with the others. He 
was carried along, half stunned, 
with the shuffling wave of bodies 
while the sirens moaned and the 
artificial northern lights in the 
sky spelled out TO ARMS!!!! in 
letters of flame each a hundred 
miles long. Someone put his hand 
out, holding Bill up as he start- 
ed to slide under the trampling 
purple boots. It was his old bud- 
dy, Ugly, carrying a satiated 
smirk and he hated him and 
tried to hit him. But before he 
could raise his fist they were 
swept into a monorail car, hurtl-

ed through the night and dis- 
gorged back in Camp Leon Trot- 
sky He forgot his anger when the 
gnarled claws of Deathwish 
Drang dragged them from the 
crowd. 

“Pack your bags,” he rasped. 
“You’re shipping out.” 

“They can’t do that to us — 
we haven’t finished our training.” 
“They can do whatever they 
want, and they usually do. A. 
glorious space battle has just 
been fought to its victorious con- 
clusion and there are over four 
million casualties, give or take 
a hundred thousand. Replace- 
ments are needed, which is you. 
Prepare to board the transports 
immediately if not sooner.” 

“We can’t — we have no 
space gear! The supply room . .” 
“All of the supply personnel 
have already been shipped out.” 
“Food . .” 

“The cooks and KP pushers 
are already spacebound. This is 
an emergency. All unessential 
personnel are being sent out. 
Probably to die.” He twanged a 
tusk coyly and watched them 
with his loathsome grin. “While 
I remain here in peaceful secur- 
ity to train your replacements.” 
The delivery tube plunked at 
his elbow and as he opened the 
message capsule and read its con- 
tents his smile slowly fell to 
pieces. “They’re shipping me out 
too,” he said, hollowly. 



\ lready 89,672,899 recruits had 
been shipped into space 
through Camp Leon Trotsky, so 
the process was an automatic 
and smoothly working one even 
though this time it was process- 
ing itself, like a snake swallow- 
ing its own tail. Bill and his bud- 
dies were the last group of re- 
cruits through and the snake 
began ingesting itself right be- 
hind them. No sooner had they 
been shorn of their sprouting 
fuzz and deloused in the ultra- 
sonic delouser than the barbers 
rushed at each other and in a 
welter of under and over arms, 
gobbets of hair, shards of mous- 
tache, bits of flesh, drops of 
blood, they clipped and shaved 
each other then pulled the opera- 
tor after them into the ultrasonic

themselves injections against roc- 
ket fever, space-cafard and the 
clap, record clerks issued them- 
selves pay books and the load- 
masters kicked each other up the

tle-ships. 

Rockets blasted, living columns 
of fire-like scarlet tongues lick- 
ing down at the blasting pads, 
burning up the ramps in a love- 
ly pyrotechnic display since the 
ramp operators were also aboard. 
The ships echoed and thundered 
up into the night sky leaving 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



25 



Camp Leon Trotsky a dark and 
silent ghost town. Bits of daily 
orders and punishment rosters 
rustled and blew from the bul- 
letin boards, dancing through the 
deserted streets to finally plaster 
themselves against the noisy, 
bright windows of the Officer’s 
Club. A great drinking party 
was in progress there, although 
there was much complaining be- 
cause they had to serve them- 
selves. 

Up and up the shuttleships 
shot, towards the great fleet of 
deep-spacers that darkened the 
stars above. It was a new fleet, 
the most powerful the galaxy 
had ever seen, so new in fact 
that the ships were still under 
construction. Welding torches 
flared in brilliant points of light 
while hot rivets hurled their flat 
trajectories across the sky into 
waiting buckets. The spots of 
light died away as one behemoth 
of the star lanes was completed 
and thin screams sounded in the 
spacesuit radio circuit as the 
workers, instead of being return- 
ed to the yards, were pressed into 
service on the ship they had so 
recently built. 

This was total war. 

T) ill staggered through the sag- 
^ ^ ging plastic tube that con- 
nected the shuttleship to a dread- 
naught of space and dropped his 
bags in front of a Petty Chief 

26 



Officer who sat at a desk in the 
hanger-sized spacelock. Or rather 
he tried to drop it, but since 
there was no gravity the bags 
remained in midair and when he 
pushed them down he rose. 
(Since a body when it is falling 
freely is said to be in free fall, 
and anything with weight has 
no weight, and for every action 
there is an equal and opposite 
reaction or something like that.) 
The Petty looked up and snarl- 
ed and pulled Bill back down to 
the deck. 

“None of your bowby space- 
lubber tricks, tropper. Name?” 
“Bill, spelled with two L’s.” 
“Bil,” the Petty mumbled, 
licking the end of his stylo, then 
inscribing it in the ship’s roster 
with round, illiterate letters. 
“Two L’s for officers only, bowb 
— learn your place. What’s your 
classification?” 

“Recruit, unskilled, untrained, 
spacesick.” 

“Well don’t puke in here, that’s 
what you have your own quarters 
for. You are now a Fusetender 
6th class, unskilled. Bunk down 
in compartment 34J-89T-001. 
Move. And keep that woopsy- 
sack over your head.” 

No sooner had Bill found his 
quarters and thrown his bags 
into a bunk, where they floated 
five inches over the reclaimed 
rock-wool mattress, then Eager 
Beager came in, followed by 

GALAXY 



by Bowb Brown and a crowd of 
strangers, some of them carrying 
welding torches and angry ex- 
pressions. 

“Where’s Ugly and the rest of 
the squad?” Bill asked. 

Bowb shrugged and strapped 
himself into his bunk for a little 
shuteye. Eager opened one of 
the six bags he always carried 
and removed some boots to pol- 
ish. 

“Are you saved?” a deep voice 
vibrant with emotion sounded 
from the other end of the com- 
partment. Bill looked up startled, 
and the big trooper standing 
there saw the motion and stabbed 
towards him with an immense 
finger. “You, brother, are you 
saved?” 

“That’s a little hard to say,” 
Bill mumbled, bending over and 
rooting in his bag, hoping the 
man would go away. But he 
didn’t, in fact he came over and 
sat down on Bill’s bunk. Bill 
tried to ignore him, but this was 
hard to do because the trooper 
was over six feet high, heavily 
muscled and iron jawed. He had 
lovely, purplish black skin that 
made Bill a little jealous because 
his was only a sort of grayish 
pink. Since the trooper’s ship- 
board uniform was almost the 
same shade of black he looked 
all of a piece, very effective 
with his flashing smile and pierc- 
ing gaze. 



4 4'IT7elcome aboard the Chris- 
’ ’ tine Keeler,” he said and 
with a friendly shake splintered 
most of Bill’s knuckle bones. 
“The grand old lady of this 
fleet, commissioned almost a 
week ago. I’m Reverend Fuse- 
tender 6th Class Tembo, and I 
see by the stencil on your bag 
that your name is Bill, and since 
we’re shipmates, Bill, please call 
me Tembo, and how is the con- 
dition of your soul?” 

“I haven’t had much chance to 
think about it lately . .” 

“I should think not, just com- 
ing from recruit training, since 
attendance of chapel during 
training is a court-martial of- 
fense. But that’s all behind you 
now and you can be saved. Might 
I ask if you are of the faith?” 
“My folks were Fundamental- 
ist Zoraoastrian, so I suppose . .” 
“Superstition, my boy, rank 
superstition. It was the hand of 
fate that brought us together in 
this ship, that your soul would 
have this one chance to be saved 
from the fiery pit. You’ve heard 
of Earth?” 

“I like plain food . .” 

“It’s a planet, my boy — the 
home of the human race. The 
home from whence we all sprang, 
see it, a green and lovely world, 
a jewel in space.” Tembo had 
slipped a tiny projector from his 
pocket while he spoke and a 
colored image appeared on the

bulkhead, a planet swimming ar- 
tistically through the void gir- 
dled by white clouds. Suddenly, 
ruddy lightning shot through the 
clouds and they twisted and boil- 
ed while great wounds appeared 
on the planet below. From the 
pinhead speaker came the tiny 
moaning sound of rolling, clash- 
ing thunder. 

“But wars sprang up among 
the sons of man and they smote 
each other with the atomic ener- 
gies until the Earth itself groaned 
aloud and mighty was the holo- 
caust. And when the final light- 
nings stilled there was death in 
the north, death in the west, 
death in the east, death, death, 
death. Do you realize what that 
means?” Tembo’s voice was elo- 
quent with feeling, suspended for 
an instant in midflight, waiting 
for the answer to the catachisti- 
cal question. 

“I’m not sure,” Bill said, root- 
ing aimlessly in his bag, “I come 
from Phigerinadon II. it’s a quiet- 
er place . .” 

“There was no death in the 
SOUTH! And why was the south 
spared, I ask you, and the an- 
swer is because it was the will of 
Samedi that all the false pro- 
phets and false religions and 
false gods be wiped from the 
face of the Earth so that the 
only true faith should remain. 
The First Reformed Voodoo 
Church , . 



eneral Quarters sounded, a 
hooting alarm keyed to the 
resonant frequency of the human 
skull so that the bone vibrated 
as though the head were inside 
a mighty bell and the eyes blur- 
red out of focus with each stroke. 
There was a scramble for the 
passageway where the hideous 
sound was not quite as loud and 
where non-coms were waiting to 
herd them to their stations. Bill 
followed Eager Beager up an oily 
ladder and out of the hatch in 
the floor of the fuse room. 

Great racks of fuses stretched 
away on all sides of them, while 
from the tops of the racks sprang 
arm-thick cables that looped up- 
wards and vanished through the 
ceiling. In front of the racks, 
evenly spaced, were round open- 
ings a foot in diameter. 

“My opening remarks will be 
brief, any trouble from any of 
you and I will personally myself 
feed you head first down the 
nearest fuseway.” A greasy fore- 
finger pointed at one of the 
holes in the deck and they re- 
cognized the voice of their new 
master. He was shorter and wid- 
er and thicker in the gut than 
Deathwish, but there was a gen- 
eric resemblance that was un- 
mistakable. 

“I am Fusetender First Class 
Spleen. I will take you crumbly 
groundcrawling bowbs and will 
turn you into highly skilled and 



28 



GALAXY 



efficient fusetenders or else feed 
you down the nearest fuseway. 
This is a highly skilled and effi- 
cient technical specialty which 
usually takes a year to train a 
good man. But this is war so 
you’re going to learn to do it 
now or else. I will now demon- 
strate. Tembo front and center. 
Take board 19J-9, it’s out of 
circuit now.” 

Tembo clashed his heels and 
stood at rigid attention in front 
of the board. Stretching away on 
both sides of him were the fuses, 
white ceramic cylinders capped 
on both ends with metal, each 
one a foot in diameter, five foot 
high and weighing 90 pounds. 
There was a red band around 
the midriff of each fuse. First 
Class Spleen tapped one of these 
bands. 

“Every fuse has one of these 
red bands which is called a fuse- 
band and is of the color red. 
When the fuse burns out this 
band turns black. I don’t expect 
you to remember all this now, 
but it’s in your manual and you 
are going to be letter perfect 
before I’m done with you, or 
else- Now I will show you what 
will happen when a fuse bums 
out. Tembo — that is a burned 
out fuse! Go!” 

“Unggh!” Tembo shouted and 
leaped at the fuse and grasped 
it with both hands. “Unggh!” he 
said again as he pulled it from 



the clips, and again Unggh! when 
he dropped it into the fuseway. 
Then, still Ungghing, he pulled 
a new fuse from the storage rack 
and clipped it into place and, 
with a final Unggh! snapped 
back to attention. 

“And that’s the way it is done, 
by the count, by the numbers, 
the trooper way and you are 
going to learn it or else.” A dull 
buzzing sounded, grumbling 
through the air like a stifled 
eructation. “There’s the chow 
call, so I’ll let you break now 
and while you’re eating think 
about what you are going to have 
to learn. Fall out.” 

/"\ther troopers were going by 
in the corridor and they fol- 
lowed them into the bowels of 
the ship. 

“Gee — do you think the food 
might be any better than it was 
back in camp?” Eager asked, 
smacking his lips excitedly. 

“It is completely impossible 
that it could be any worse,” Bill 
said as they joined a line leading 
to a door labeled CONSOLI- 
DATED MESS NUMBER 
TWO. “Any change will have to 
make it better. After all — aren’t 
we fighting troopers now? We 
have to go into combat fit, the 
manual says.” 

The line moved forward with 
painful slowness, but within an 
hour they were at the door. In-

side of it a tired looking KP 
in soapstained, greasy fatigues 
handed Bill a yellow plastic cup 
from a rack before him. Bill 
moved on and when the trooper 
in front of him stepped away he 
faced a blank wall from which 
there emerged a single, handle- 
less spigot. A fat cook standing 
next to it, wearing a large white 
chef’s hat and a soiled under- 
shirt, waved him forwards with 
the soup ladle in his hand. 

“C’mon, co’mon, ain’t you 
never et before? Cup under the 
spout, dogtag in the slot, snap 
it up!” 

Bill held the cup as he had 
been advised and noticed a nar- 
row slit in the metal wall just 
at eye level. His dogtags were 
hanging around his neck and he 
pushed one of them into the 
slot. Something went buzzzzz 
and a thin stream of yellow fluid 
gushed out, filling the cup half- 
way. 

“Next man!” the cook shouted 
and pulled Bill away so that 
Eager could take his place. 
“What is this?” Bill asked, peer- 
ing into the cup. 

“What is this! What is this!” 
the cook raged, growing bright 
red. “This is your dinner you 
stupid bowb! This is absolutely 
chemically pure water in which 
are dissolved 18 amino acids, 16 
vitamins, 11 mineral salts, a flat- 
ty acid ester and glucose. What 



else did you expect?” 

“Dinner . .?” Bill said hope- 
fully, then saw red as the soup 
ladle crashed down on his head. 
“Could I have it without the 
fatty acid ester?” he asked hope- 
fully, but he was pushed out in- 
to the corridor where Eager 
joined him. 

“Gee,” Eager said. “This has 
all the food elements necessary 
to sustain life indefinitely. Isn’t 
that marvelous?” 

Bill sipped at his cup then 
sighed tremulously. 

44T ook at that,” Tembo said, 
' and when Bill turned, a 
projected image appeared on the 
corridor wall. It showed a misty 
firmament in which tiny figures 
seemed to be riding on clouds. 
“Hell awaits you, my boy, unless 
you are saved. Turn your back 
on your superstitious way. The 
First Reformed Voodoo Church 
welcomes you with open arms, 
come unto her bosom and find 
your place in heaven at Samedi’s 
right hand. Sit there with Mon- 
dongue and Bakalou and Zandor 
who will welcome you.” 

The projected scene changed, 
the clouds grew closer, while 
from the little speaker came the 
tiny sound of a heavenly choir 
with drum accompaniment. Now 
tile figures could be seen clearly, 
all with very dark skins and white 
robes from the back of which 



30 



GALAXY 



protruded great black wings. 
They smiled and waved grace- 
fully to each other as their 
clouds passed, while singing en- 
thusiastically and beating on the 
little tom-toms that each one 
carried. It was a lovely scene and 
Bill’s eyes misted a bit. 

“Attention!" 

The barking tones echoed from 
the walls and the troopers snap- 
ped their shoulders back, heels 
together, eyes ahead. The heav- 
enly choir vanished as Tembo 
shoved the projector back into 
his pocket. 

“As you was,” First Class 
Spleen ordered, and they turned 
to see him leading two MPs with 
drawn handguns who were acting 
as a bodyguard for an officer. 
Bill knew it was an officer be- 
cause they had had an Officer 
Identification course, plus the 
fact that there was a KNOW 
YOUR OFFICERS chart on the 
latrine wall that he had had a 
great deal of opportunity to 
study during an anguilluliasis 
epidemic. His jaw gaped open as 
the officer went by, almost close 
enough to touch, and stopped in 
front of Tembo. 

“Fusetender 6th Class Tembo 
I have good news for you. In two 
weeks your seven year period of 
enlistment will be up and be- 
cause of your fine record Cap- 
tain Zekial has authorized a 
doubling of the usual mustering- 



out pay, an honorable discharge 
with band music as well as your 
free transport back to Earth.” 
Tembo, relaxed yet firm, look- 
ed down at the runty lieutenant 
with his well-chewed blonde 
moustache who stood before him. 
“That will be impossible, sir.” 

1 1 T mpossible ! ” the lieutenant 
A screeched and rocked back 
and forth on his high-heeled 
boots. “Who are you to tell me 
what is impossible — ?!” 

“Not I, sir,” Tembo answered 
with utmost calm. “Regulation 
13-9A, paragraph 45, page 8923, 
volume 43 of Rules, Regulations 
and Articles of War. ‘No man 
nor officer shall or will receive 
a discharge other than dishonor- 
able with death sentence from a 
vessel, post, base, camp, ship, 
outpost, or labor camp during 
time of emergency’ . .” 

“Are you a ship’s lawyer, Tem- 
bo?” 

“No, sir. I’m a loyal trooper, 
sir. I just want to do my duty, 
sir. 

“There’s something very funny 
about you, Tembo. I saw in your 
record that you enlisted volun- 
tarily without drugs and or hyp- 
notics being used. Now you re- 
fuse discharge. That’s bad, Tem- 
bo, very bad. Gives you a bad 
name. Makes you look suspi- 
cious. Makes you look like a spy 
or something.” 



32 



GALAXY 



“I’m a loyal trooper, of the 
Emperor, sir, not a spy.” 

“You’re not a spy, Tembo, we 
have looked into that very care- 
fully. But why are you in the 
service, Tembo?” 

“To be a loyal trooper of the 
Emperor, sir, and to do my best 
to spread the gospel. Have you 
been saved, sir?” 

“Watch your tongue, trooper 
or I’ll have you up on charges! 
Yes, we know that story — rev- 
erend — but we don’t believe it. 
You’re being too tricky, but we’ll 
find out . .” He stalked away 
muttering to himself and they all 
snapped to attention until he 
was gone. The other troopers 
looked at Tembo oddly and did 
not feel comfortable until he had 
gone. Bill and Eager walked slow- 
ly back to their quarters. 

“Turned down a discharge!” 
Bill mumbled in awe. 

“Gee,” Eager said, “maybe he’s 
nuts? I can’t think of any other 
reason.” 

“Nobody could be that crazy,” 
then “I wonder what’s in there?” 
pointing to a door with a large 
sign that read ADMITTANCE 
TO AUTHORIZED PERSON- 
NEL ONLY. 

“Gee — I don’t know — maybe 
food?” 

They slipped through instantly 
and closed the door behind them, 
but there was no food there. In- 
stead they were in a long cham- 

THE STARSLOGGERS 



ber with one curved wall, while 
attached to this wall were cum- 
bersome devices set with meters, 
dials, switches, controls, levers, 
a view screen and a relief tube. 
Bill bent over and read the label 
on the nearest one. 

“Mark IV Atomic Blaster — 
and look at the size of them! 
This must be the ship’s main 
battery.” He turned around and 
saw that Eager was holding his 
arm up so that his wristwatch 
pointed at the guns and was 
pressing on the crown with the 
index finger of his other hand. 

“What are you doing?” Bill 
asked. 

“Gee — just seeing what time 
it was.” 

“How can you tell what time 
it is when you have the inside 
of your wrist towards your face 
and the watch is on the out- 
side?” 

Footsteps echoed far down the 
long gundeck and they remem- 
bered the sign on the outside of 
the door. In an instant they had 
slipped back through it and Bill 
pressed it quietly shut. When he 
turned around Eager Beager had 
gone so that he had to make his 
way back to their quarters by 
himself. Eager was busy shining 
boots for his buddies and didn’t 
look up from his work when Bill 
came in. 

But what had he been doing 
with his watch? 



33 



V 



'T'his question kept bugging Bill 
all the time during the days 
of their training as they painfully 
learned the drill of fusetending. 
It was an exacting, technical job 
that demanded all their atten- 
tion, but in spare moments Bill 
worried. He worried when they 
stood in line for chow, and he 
worried during the few moments 
every night between the time the 
lights were turned off and the 
heavy descent of sleep rested 
upon his fatigue drugged body. 
He worried whenever he had the 
time to do it. And he lost weight. 

He lost weight not because he 
was worrying, but for the same 
reason everyone else lost weight. 
The shipboard rations. They were 
designed to sustain life, and that 
they did, but no mention was 
made of what kind of life it was 
to be. It was a dreary, under- 
weight, hungry one. Yet Bill took 
no notice of this. He had a big- 
ger problem and he needed help. 
After Sunday drill at the end of 
their second week he stayed to 
talk to First Class Spleen instead 
of joining the others in their 
tottering run towards the mess 
hall. 

“I have a problem, sir.” 

“You ain’t the only one, but 
one shot cures it and you ain’t 
a man until you’ve had it.” 

“It’s not that kind of problem. 



I’d like to . see the . chap- 
lain . .” 

Spleen turned white and sank 
back against the bulkhead. “Now 
I heard everything,” he said 
weakly. “Get down to chow and 
if you don’t tell anyone about 
this, I won’t either.” 

Bill blushed. “I’m sorry about 
this, First Class Spleen, but I 
can’t help it. It’s not my fault I 
have to see him, it could have 
happened to anyone.” His voice 
trailed away and he looked down 
at his feet, rubbing one boot 
against another. The silence 
stretched out until Spleen finally 
spoke, but all the comradeliness 
was gone from his voice. 

“Alright, trooper — if that’s 
the way you want it. But I hope 
none of the rest of the boys hear 
about it. Skip chow and get up 
there now — here’s a pass.” He 
scrawled on a scrap of paper then 
threw it contemptuously to the 
floor, turning and walking away 
as Bill bent humbly to pick it 
up. 

B ill went down dropchutes, 
along corridors, through pas- 
sageways and up ladders. In the 
ship’s directory the chaplain was 
listed as being in compartment 
362 -B on the 89th deck and Bill 
finally found this, a plain metal 
door set with rivets. He raised 
his hand to knock while sweat 
stood out in great beads from his 



34 



GALAXY 



fece and his throat was dry. His 
knuckles boomed hollowly on the 
panel and after an endless per- 
iod a muffled voice sounded from 
the other side. 

“Yeah, yeah — c’mon in — it’s 
open.” 

Bill stepped through and snap- 
ped to attention when he saw the 
officer behind the single desk 
that almost filled the tiny room. 
The officer, a 4th lieutenant, 
though still young was balding 
rapidly. There were black circles 
under his eyes and he needed a 
shave. His tie, was knotted crook- 
edly and badly crumpled. He 
continued to scratch among the 
stacks of paper that littered the 
desk, picking them up, changing 
piles with them, scrawling notes 
on some and throwing others into 
an overflowing wastebasket. 
When he moved one of the stacks 
Bill saw a sign on the desk that 
read LAUNDRY OFFICER. 

“Excuse me, sir,” he said, “but 
I am in the wrong office. I’m 
looking for the chaplain.” 

“This is the chaplain’s office 
but he’s not on duty until 1300 
hours, which, as someone even 
as stupid looking as you can tell, 
is in fifteen minutes more.” 

“Thank you, sir, I’ll come 
back.” Bill slid towards the door. 

“You’ll stay and work.” The 
officer raised bloodshot eyeballs 
and cackled evilly. “I got you. 
You can sort the hanky reports. 



I’ve lost 600 jockstraps and they 
may be in there. You think it’s 
easy to be a laundry officer?” 
He sniveled with self-pity and 
pushed a tottering stack of pap- 
ers over to Bill who began to 
sort through them. Long before 
he was finished the buzzer sound- 
ed that ended the watch. 

“I knew it!” the officer sobbed 
hopelessly. “This job will never 
end, instead it gets worse and 
worse. And you think you got 
problems!” He reached out an 
unsteady finger and flipped over 
the sign on his desk. It read 
CHAPLAIN on the other side. 
Then he grabbed the end of his 
necktie and pulled it back hard 
over his right shoulder. The neck- 
tie was fastened to his collar 
and the collar was set into ball 
bearings that rolled smoothly in 
a track fixed to his shirt. There 
was a slight whirring sound as 
the collar rotated, then the neck- 
tie was hanging out of sight down 
his back and his collar was now 
on backwards, showing white and 
smooth and cool to the front. 

nphe chaplain steepled his fin- 
gers before him, lowered his 
eyes and smiled sweetly. “How 
may I help you my son?” 

“I thought you were the laun- 
dry officer.” Bill said, taken 
aback. 

“I am, my son, but that is just 
one of the burdens that must fall 



THE STARSLOGGERS

upon my shoulders. There is 
little call for a chaplain in these 
troubled times, but much call 
for a laundry officer. I do my 
best to serve.” He bent his head, 
humbly. 

“But — which are you? A chap- 
lain who is a part-time laundry 
officer, or a laundry officer who 
is a part-time chaplain?” 

“That is a mystery, my son. 
There are some things that it is 
best not to know. But I see you 
are troubled. May I ask if you 
are of the faith?” 

“Which faith?” 

“That’s what I’m asking you!” 
the chaplain snapped, and for 
a moment the old laundry offi- 
cer peeped through. “How can I 
help you if I do not know what 
your religion is?” 
“Fundamentalist Zoroastrian.” 
The chaplain took a plastic 
covered sheet from a drawer and 
ran his finger down it. “Z . 
Z . Zen . Zodomite . 
Zoroastrian, Reformed Funda- 
mentalist, is that the one?” 

“Yes sir.” 

“Well, should be no trouble 
with this my son ... 2 1 52 05 . .” 
He quickly dialed the number 
on a control plate set in the 
desk, then, with a grand gesture 
and an evangelistic gleam in his 
eye, he swept all the laundry 
papers to the floor. Hidden ma- 
chinery hummed briefly, a por- 
tion of the desk top dropped 



away and reappeared a moment 
later bearing a black plastic box 
decorated with golden bulls, ram- 
pant. “Be with you in a second,” 
the chaplain said, opening the 
box. 

First he unrolled a length of 
white cloth sewn with more gold- 
en bulls and draped this around 
his neck. He placed a thick, 
leather-bound book next to the 
box, then on the closed lid set 
two metal bulls with hollowed 
out backs. Into one of them he 
poured distilled water from a 
plastic flask and into the other 
sweet oil, which he ignited. Bill 
watched these familiar arrange- 
ments with growing happiness. 

“It’s very lucky,” Bill said, 
“that you are a Zoroastrian. It 
makes it much easier to talk to 
you.” 

U VT° luck involved, my son, 
^ just intelligent planning.” 
The chaplain dropped some pow- 
dered haoma into the flame and 
Bill’s nose twitched as the drug- 
ged incense filled the room. “By 
the grace of Ahura Mazdan I am 
an anointed priest of Zoroastra. 
By Allah’s will a faithful Muez- 
zin of Islam, through Yahweh’s 
intercession a circumcized rabbi, 
and so forth.” His benign face 
broke into a savage snarl. “And 
also because of an officer short- 
age I am the damned laundry 
officer.” His face cleared. “But

now, you must tell me your prob- 
lem.” 

“Well, it’s not easy. It may be 
just foolish suspicion on my part, 
but I’m worried about one of 
my buddies. There is something 
strange about him. I’m not sure 
how to tell it . 

“Have confidence, my boy, and 
reveal your innermost feelings to 
me and do not fear. What I hear 
shall never leave this room for 
I am bound to secrecy by the 
oath of my calling. Unburden 
yourself.” 

“That’s very nice of you, and 
I do feel better already. You see 
this buddy of mine has always 
been a little funny, he shines the 
boots for all of us and volunteer- 
ed for latrine orderly and doesn’t 
like girls.” 

The chaplain nodded beatifi- 
cally and fanned some of the in- 
cense towards his nose. “I see 
little here to worry you, he 
sounds a decent lad. For is it not 
written in the Vendidad that we 
should aid our fellow man and 
seek to shoulder his burdens and 
pursue not the harlots of the 
streets?” 

Bill pouted. “That’s alright for 
Sunday school, but it’s no way to 
act in the troopers! Anyway, we 
just thought he was out of his 
mind and he might have been — 
but that’s not all. I was with him 
on the gun deck and he pointed 
his watch at the guns and pressed 



the stem and I heard it click! 
It could be a camera. I ... I 
think he is a Chinger spy!” Bill 
sat back, breathing deeply and 
sweating. The fatal words had 
been spoken. 

The chaplain continued to nod, 
smiling, half unconscious from 
the haoma fumes. Finally he 
snapped out of it, blew his nose 
and opened the thick copy of the 
Avesta. He mumbled aloud in 
old Persian a bit, which seemed 
to brace him, then slammed it 
shut. 

“You must not bear false wit- 
ness!” he boomed, fixing Bill 
with piercing gaze and accusing 
finger. 

tiATou got me wrong,” Bill 

- * moaned, writhing in the 
chair. “He’s done these things, I 
saw him use the watch. What 
kind of spiritual aid do you call 
this?” 

“Just a bracer my boy, a touch 
of the old-time religion to re- 
new your sense of guilt and start 
you thinking about going to 
church regular again. You have 
been backsliding!” the chaplain 
roared. 

“What else could I do — chap- 
el is forbidden during recruit 
training.” 

“Circumstance is no excuse, 
but you will be forgiven this time 
because Ahura Mazdah is all- 
merciful.”

“But what about my buddy — 
the spy?” 

“You must forget your suspi- 
cions, for they are not worthy of 
a follower of Zoroaster. This poor 
lad must not suffer because of 
his natural inclinations to be 
friendly, to aid his comrades, to 
keep himself pure, to own a 
crummy watch that goes click. 
And besides, if you do not mind 
my introducing a spot of logic — 
how could he be a spy? To be 
a spy he would have to be a 
Chinger, and Chingers are seven 
feet tall with tails. Catch?” 
“Yeah, yeah,” Bill mumbled 
unhappily. “I could figure that 
out for myself — but it still 
doesn’t explain everything.” 

“It satisfies me, and it must 
satisfy you. I feel that Ahriman 
has possessed you to make you 
think evil of your comrade, and 
you had better do some penance 
and join me in a quick prayer 
before the laundry officer comes 
back on duty.” 

This ritual was quickly fin- 
ished and Bill helped stow the 
things back in the box and watch- 
ed it vanish back into the desk. 
He made his good-bys and turn- 
ed to leave. 

“Just one moment, my son,” 
the chaplain said with his warm- 
est smile, reaching back over his 
shoulder at the same time to 
grab the end of his necktie. He 
pulled and his collar whirred 



about and as it did the blissful 
expression was wiped from his 
face to be replaced by a surly 
snarl. “Just where do you think 
you’re going, bowb! Put your ass 
back in that chair.” 

“B-but,” Bill stammered, “you 
said I was dismissed.” 

“That’s what the chaplain said, 
and as laundry officer I have no 
truck with him. Now — fast — 
what’s the name of this Chinger 
spy you’re hiding?” 

“I told you about that under 
oath — ” 

t C \/'ou told the chaplain about 
* it, and he keeps his word 
and he didn’t tell me, but I just 
happened to hear.” He pressed 
a red button on the control pan- 
el. “The MPs are on the way. 
You talk before they get here, 
bowb, or I’ll have you keelhaul- 
ed without a spacesuit and de- 
prived of canteen privileges for a 
year. The name?” 

“Eager Beager,” Bill sobbed as 
heavy feet trampled outside and 
two redhats forced their way 
into the tiny room. 

“I have a spy for you boys,” 
the laundry officer announced 
triumphantly and the MPs grated 
their teeth, howled deep in their 
throats, and launched themselves 
through the air at Bill. He drop- 
ped under the assault of fists 
and clubs and was running with 
blood before the laundry officer 



38 



GALAXY 



could pull the overmuscled mor- 
ons with their eyes not an inch 
apart, off him. 

“Not him . the officer 
gasped, and threw Bill a towel to 
wipe off some of the blood. ‘‘This 
is our informant, the loyal, pa- 
triotic hero who ratted on his 
buddy by the name of Eager 
Beager, who we will now grab 
and chain so he can be question- 
ed. Let’s go.” 

The MPs held Bill up between 
them and by the time they had 
come to the fusetenders’ quar- 
ters the breeze from their swift 
passage had restored him a bit. 
The laundry officer opened the 
door just enough to poke in his 
head. “Hi, gang!” he called cheer- 
ily. “Is Eager Beager here?” 
Eager looked up from the boot 
he was polishing, waving and 
grinning. “That’s me — gee.” 
“Get him!” the laundry offic- 
er expostulated, jumping aside 
and pointing accusingly. Bill 
dropped to the floor as the MPs 
let go of him and thundered into 
the compartment. By the time he 
had staggered back to his feet 
Eager was pinioned handcuffed 
and chained, hand and foot, but 
still grinning. 

“Gee — you guys want some 
boots polished too?” 

“No backtalk you dirty spy,” 
the laundry officer grated and 
slapped him hard on the offen- 
sive grin. At least he tried to 



slap him on the offensive grin 
but Beager opened his mouth 
and bit the hand that hit him, 
clamping down hard so that the 
officer could not get away. “He 
bit me!” the man howled and 
tried desperately to pull free. 
Both MPs, each handcuffed to 
an arm of the prisoner, raised 
their clubs to give him a sound 
battering. 

At this moment the top of 
Eager Beager’s head flew open. 

TTappening at any other time 
-*■ ^ this would have been con- 
sidered unusual, but happening 
at this moment it was spectacu- 
larly unusual and they all, in- 
cluding Bill, gaped as a seven- 
inch high lizard climbed out of 
the open skull and jumped to 
the floor in which it made a size- 
able dent upon landing. It had 
four tiny arms, a long tail, a head 
like a baby alligator and was 
bright green. It looked exactly 
like a Chinger except that it was 
seven inches tall instead of seven 
feet. 

“All bowby humans have B. 
O.” it said in a thin imitation of 
Eager Beager’s voice. “Chingers 
can’t sweat Chingers forever!” 
It charged across the compart- 
ment toward Beager’s bunk. 

Paralysis prevailed. All of the 
fusetenders who had witnessed 
the impossible events stood or 
sat as they had been, frozen with 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



39 



shock and eyes bulging like hard- 
boiled eggs. The laundry officer 
was pinioned by the teeth locked 
into his hand, while the two MPs 
struggled with the handcuffs that 
held them to the immobile body. 
Only Bill was free to move and, 
still dizzy from the beating, he 
bent over to grab the tiny crea- 
ture. Small and powerful talons 
locked into his flesh and he was 
pulled from his feet and went 
sailing through the air to crash 
against a bulkhead. “Gee — 
that’s for you, you stoolie!” the 
miniscule voice squeeked. 

Before anyone else could in- 
terfere the lizardoid ran to Beag- 
er’s pile of barracks bags and 
tore the topmost one open and 
dived inside. A highpitched hum- 
ming grew in volume an instant 
later and from the bag emerged 
the bulletlike nose of a shining 
projectile. It pushed out until a 
tiny spaceship not two feet long 
floated in the compartment. 
Then it rotated about its vertical 
axis, stopped when it pointed at 
the bulkhead. The humming rose 
in pitch and the ship suddenly 
shot forward and tore through 
the metal of the partition as if 
it. had been no stronger than wet 
cardboard. There were other dis- 
tant tearing sounds as it pene- 
trated bulkhead after bulkhead 
until, with a rending clang it 
crashed through the outer skin 
of the ship and escaped into 



space. There was the roar of air 
rushing into the void and the 
clamor of alarm bells. 

“Well I'll be damned.” the 
laundry officer said, then snap- 
ped his gaping mouth closed and 
screamed, “Get this thing offa 
my hand — it’s biting me to 
death!” 

The two MPs swayed back and 
forth, handcuffed effectively to 
the immobile figure of the form- 
er Eager Beager. Beager just 
stared, smiling around the grip 
he had on the officer’s hand, and 
it wasn’t until Bill got his atomic 
rifle and put the barrel into 
Eager’s mouth and levered the 
jaw open that the hand could be 
withdrawn. While he did this Bill 
saw that the top of Eager’s head 
had split open just above his 
ears and was held at the back 
by a shiny brass hinge. Inside the 
gaping skull, instead of brains 
and bones and things, was a 
model control room with a tiny 
chair, miniscule controls, teevee 
screens and a water cooler. Eag- 
er was just a robot worked by the 
little creature that had escaped 
in the spaceship. It looked like 
a Chinger — but it was only sev- 
en inches tall. 

“Hey!” Bill said, “Eager is 
just a robot worked by the little 
creature that escaped in the 
spaceship! It looked like a Chin- 
ger — but it was only seven 
inches tall . 



40 



GALAXY 



“Seven inches, seven feet — 
what difference does it make!” 
the laundry officer mumbled pe- 
tulantly as he wrapped a hand- 
kerchief around his wounded 
hand. “You don’t expect us to 
tell the recruits how big the 
enemy really are, or to explain 
that they come from a 10G plan- 
et. We gotta keep the morale 
up.” 

VI 

VTow that Eager Beager had 
^ ' turned out to be a Chinger 
spy, Bill felt very much alone. 
Bowb Brown, who never talked 
anyway, now talked even less, 
which meant never, so there was 
no one that Bill could bitch to. 
Bowb was the only other fuse- 
man in the compartment who 
had been in Bill’s squad at Camp 
Leon Trotsky, and all of the new 
men were very clannish and giv- 
en to sitting close together and 
mumbling and throwing suspi- 
cious looks over their shoulders 
if he should come too close. Their 
only recreation was welding and 
every offwatch they would break 
out the welders and weld things 
to the floor and the next watch 
cut them loose again which is 
about as dim a way of wasting 
time as there is, but they seemed 
to enjoy it. So Bill was very 
much out of things and tried 
bitching to Eager Beager. 



“Look at the trouble you got 
me into!” he whined. 

“At least close your head when 
I’m talking to you,” Bill snarled 
and reached over to slam the 
top of Eager’s head shut. But it 
didn’t do any good. Eager 
couldn’t do anything now except 
smile. He had polished his last 
boot. He just stood there now, he 
was really very heavy and be- 
sides was magnetized to the floor. 
The fusetenders hung their dirty 
shirts and arc welders on him. He 
stayed there for three watches 
before someone figured out what 
to do with him. Finally a squad 
of MPs came with crowbars and 
tilted him into a handcar and 
rolled him away. 

“So long,” Bill called out, wav- 
ing after him, then went back 
to polishing his boots. “He was 
a good buddy even if he was a 
Chinger spy.” 

Bowb didn’t answer him, and 
welders wouldn’t talk to him and 
he spent a lot of the time avoid- 
ing Reverend Tembo. The grand 
old lady of the fleet, Christine 
Keeler, was still in orbit while 
her engines were being installed. 
There was very little to do be- 
cause, in spite of what First Class 
Spleen had said they had mast- 
ered all the intricies of fusetend- 
ing in a little less than the pre- 
scribed year — in fact it took 
them something like maybe fif- 
teen minutes.

In his free time Bill wandered 
around the ship, going as far as 
the MPs who guarded the hatch- 
ways would allow him. He even 
considered going back to se 
chaplain so he could have 
one to bitch to. But if he timed 
it wrong he might meet the 
laundry officer again and that 
was more than he could face. So 
he walked through the ship, very 
much alone, and looked in 
through the door of a compart- 
ment and saw a boot on a bed. 

T)ill stopped, frozen, immobile, 
shocked, rigid, horrified, dis- 
mayed, and had to fight for con- 
trol of his suddenly contracted 
bladder. 

He knew that boot. He would 
never forget that boot until the 
day he died, just as he would 
never forget his serial number 
and could say it frontwards or 
backwards or from the inside out. 
Every detail of that terrible boot 
was clear in his memory from the 
snakelike laces in the repulsive 
leather of the uppers — said to 
be made of human skin — to the 
corrugated stamping soles tinged 
with red that could only have 
been human blood. 

.That boot belonged to Death- 
wish Drang. 

The boot was attached to a 
leg and paralyzed with terror, 
as unable to control himself as 
a bird before a snake, he found 

42 



himself leaning further and fur- 
ther into the compartment as 
his eyes traced up the leg past 
the belt to the shirt to the neck 
upon which rested the fa" -> that 
had featured largely in his night- 
mares since he had enlisted. The 
lips moved. 

“Is that you Bill? C’mon in and 
rest it.” 

Bill stumbled in. 

“Have a hunk of candy,” 
Deathwish said, and smiled. 

Reflex drove Bill’s fingers into 
the offered box and set his jaw 
chewing on the first solid food 
that had passed his lips in weeks. 
Saliva spouted from dusty ori- 
fices and his stomach gave a 
preliminary rumble while his 
thoughts drove maddingly in cir- 
cles while he tried to figure out 
what expression was on Death- 
wish’s face. Lips curved at the 
corners behind the tusks, little 
crinkles on the cheeks. It was 
hopeless. He could not recognize 
it. 

“I hear Eager Beager turned 
out to be a Chinger spy,” Death- 
wish said, closing the box of 
candy and sliding it under the 
pillow. “I should have figured 
that one out myself. I knew there 
was something very wrong with 
him, doing his buddies’ boots and 
that crap, but I though he was 
just nuts. Should have known 
better . .” 

“Deathwish,” Bill said hoarse- 

GALAXY 



ly, “it can’t be, I know — but 
you are acting like a human be- 
ing!” 

Deathwish chuckled, not his 
ripsaw - slicing - human - bone 
chuckle, but an almost normal 
one. 

Bill stammered. “But you are 
a sadist, a pervert, a beast, a 
creature, a thing, a murderer . 

“Why, thanks, Bill. That’s very 
nice to hear. I try to do my job 
to the best of my abilities, but 
I’m human enough to enjoy a 
word of praise now and then. 
Being a murderer is hard to pro- 
ject but I’m glad it got across, 
even to a recruit as stupid as 
you were.” 

“B-but . aren’t you really 
a . 

4 4'TT'asy now!” Deathwish snap- 
J ped, and there was enough 
of the old venom and vileness to 
lower Bill’s body temperature 
six degrees. Then Deathwish 
smiled again. “Can’t blame you, 
son, for carrying on this way, 
you being kind of stupid and 
from a rube planet and having 
your education retarded by the 
troopers and all that. But wake 
up, boy! Military education is 
far too important a thing to be 
wasted by allowing amateurs to 
get involved. If you read some 
of the things in our college text- 
books it would make your blood 
cold, yes indeed. Do you realize 



that in prehistoric times the drill- 
sergeants or whatever it was they 
called them, that they were real 
sadists! The armed forces would 
let these people with no real 
knowledge absolutely destroy re- 
cruits. Let them learn to hate 
the service before they learned 
to fear it, which wrecks hell with 
discipline. And talk about waste- 
ful! They were always marching 
someone to death by accident or 
drowning a squad or nonsense 
like that. The waste alone would 
make you cry.” 

“Could I ask what you major- 
ed in in college?” Bill asked in 
a very tiny and humble voice. 

“Military Discipline, Spirit 
Breaking and Method Acting. A 
rough course, four years, but I 
graduated Sigma Cum, which is 
not bad for a boy from a work- 
ing class family. I’ve made a 
career of the service and that’s 
why I can’t understand why the 
ungrateful bastards went and 
shipped me out on this crummy 
can!” He lifted his goldrimmed 
glasses to flick away a develop- 
ing tear. 

“You expect gratitude from 
the service?” Bill asked humbly. 

“No, of course not, how fool- 
ish of me. Thanks for jerking me 
back into line, Bill, you’ll make 
a good trooper. All I expect is 
criminal indifference which I can 
take advantage of by working 
through the old boys’ network,

bribery, cutting false orders, 
black-marketing and the other 
usual things. It’s just that I had 
been doing a good job on you 
slobs in Camp Leon Trotsky and 
the least I expected was to be 
left alone to keep doing it, which 
was pretty damn stupid of me. I 
had better get cracking on my 
transfer now.” He slid to his feet 
and stowed the candy and gold- 
rimmed glasses away in a locked 
footlocker. 

T> ill, who in moments of shock 
found it hard to adjust in- 
stantly, was still bobbing his head 
and occasionally banging it with 
the heel of his hand. “Lucky 
thing,” he said, “for your chosen 
career that you were born de- 
formed — I mean you have such 
nice teeth.” 

“Luck nothing,” Deathwish 
said, plunking one of his project- 
ing tusks, “expensive as hell. Do 
you know what a gene-mutated, 
vat- grown, surgically implanted 
set of two-inch tusks cost? I bet 
you don’t know! I worked the 
summer vac for three years to 
earn enough to buy these — but 
I tell you they were worth it. The 
image, that’s everything. I stud- 
ied the old tapes of prehistoric 
spiritbreakers and in their own 
crude way they were good. Se- 
lected by physical type and low 
I.Q. of course, but they knew 
their roles. Bullet heads, shaved 



clean with scars, thick jaws, re- 
pulsive manners, hot pants, ev- 
erything. I figured a small in- 
vestment in the beginning would 
pay rich dividends in the end. 
And it was a sacrifice, believe 
me, you won’t see many im- 
planted tusks around! For a lot 
of reasons. Oh, maybe they are 
good for eating rough meat, but 
what the hell else? Wait until 
you try kissing your first girl 
. Now, get lost Bill, I got 
things to do. See you around.” 

His last words faded in the 
distance since Bill’s well-condi- 
tioned reflexes had carried him 
down the corridor the instant he 
had been dismissed. When the 
spontaneous terror faded he be- 
gan to walk with a crafty roll, 
like a duck with a spring knee- 
cap, that he thought looked like 
an old spacesailor’s gait. He was 
beginning to feel a seasoned hand 
and momentarily labored under 
the delusion that he knew more 
about the troopers than they 
knew about him. This pathetic 
misconception was dispelled in- 
stantly by the speakers on the 
ceiling which belched and then 
grated their nasal voices through- 
out the ship. 

“Now hear this, the orders di- 
rect from the old man himself, 
Captain Zekial, that you all have 
been waiting to hear. We’re 
heading into action so we are 
going to have a clean buckle- 



GALAXY 



down fore and aft, stow all loose 
gear.” 

A low, heartfelt groan of pain 
echoed from every compartment 
of the immense ship. 

VII 

nphere was plenty of latrine 
rumor and scuttlebutt about 
this first flight of the Chris’ 
Keeler but none of it was true. 
The rumors were planted by 
undercover MPs and were value- 
less. About the only thing they 
could be sure of was that they 
might be going someplace be- 
cause they seemed to be getting 
ready to go someplace. Even 
Tembo admitted to that as they 
lashed down fuses in the store- 
room. 

“Then again,” he added, “we 
might be doing all this just to 
fool any spies into thinking we 
are going someplace when really 
some other ships are going there.” 

“Where?” Bill asked irritably, 
tying his forefinger into a knot 
and removing part of the nail 
when he pulled it free. 

“Why anyplace at all, it doesn’t 
matter.” Tembo was undisturbed 
by anything that did not bear 
on his faith. “But I do know 
where you are going, Bill.” 

“Where?” Eagerly. A peren- 
nial sucker for a rumor. 

“Straight to hell unless you 
are saved.” 



“Not again.” Bill pleaded. 

“Look there,” Tembo said 
temptingly, and projected a hea- 
venly scene with golden gates, 
clouds and a soft tom-tom beat 
in the background. 

“Knock off that salvation 
crap!” First Class Spleen shout- 
ed, and the scene vanished. 

Something tugged slightly at 
Bill’s stomach, but he ignored it 
as being just another of the 
symptoms sent up continually by 
his panic-stricken gut which 
thought it was starving to death 
and hadn’t yet realized that all 
its marvelous grinding and dis- 
solving machinery had been con- 
demned to a liquid diet. But 
Tembo stopped work and cock- 
ed his head to one side, then 
poked himself experimentally in 
the stomach. 

“We’re moving,” he said posi- 
tively, “and going interstellar 
too. They’ve turned on the star- 
drive.” 

“You mean we are breaking 
through into sub-space and will 
soon experience the terrible 
wrenching at every fiber of our 
being?” 

“No, they don’t use the old 
sub-space drive anymore because 
though a lot of ships broke 
through into sub- space with a 
fiber-wrenching jerk, none of 
them have yet broke back out. 
I read in the Trooper’s Times 
where some mathematician said 



THE STAR LOGGERS 



45 



that there had been a slight er- 
ror in the equations and that 
time was different in sub-space, 
but it was different faster not 
different slower so that it will be 
maybe forever before those ships 
come out.” 

t*nphen we’re going into hy- 
perspace?” 

“No such thing.” 

“Or we’re being dissolved into 
our component atoms and re- 
corded in the memory of a giant 
computer who thinks we are 
someplace else so there we are?” 
“Wow!” Tembo said, his eye- 
brows crawling up to his hairline. 
“For a Zoroastrian farmboy you 
have some strange ideas! Have 
you been smoking or drinking 
something I don’t know about?” 
“Tell me!” Bill pleaded. “If 
it’s not one of them — what is 
it? We’re going to have to cross 
interstellar space to fight the 
Chingers. How are we going to 
do it?” 

“It’s like this,” Tembo looked 
around to make sure that First 
Class Spleen was out of sight, 
then put his cupped hands to- 
gether to form a ball. “You make 
believe that my hands are the 
ship, just floating in space. Then 
the bloater drive is turned on — ” 
“The what?” 

“The bloater drive, it’s called 
that because it bloats things up. 
You know, everything is made 



up of little bitty things called 
electrons, protons, neutrons, tron- 
trons, things like that, sort of 
held together by a kind of bind- 
ing energy. Now if you weaken 
the energy that holds things to- 
gether — I forgot to tell you that 
also they are spinning around 
all the time like crazy, or maybe 
you already know — you weaken 
the energy and because they are 
going around so fast all the little 
pieces start to move away from 
each other, and the weaker the 
energy the further apart they 
move. Are you with me so far?” 
“I think I am, but I’m not 
sure that I like it.” 

“Keep cool. Now — see my 
hands? As the energy gets weak- 
er the ship gets bigger,” he mov- 
ed his hands farther apart. “It 
gets bigger and bigger until it 
is as big as a planet, then as big 
as a sun then a whole stellar 
system. The bloater drive can 
make us just as big as we want 
to be, then it’s turned the other 
way and we shrink back to our 
regular size and there we are.” 
“ Where are we?” 

“Wherever we want to be,” 
Tembo answered patiently. 

Bill turned away and indust- 
riously rubbed shine-o onto a 
fuse as First Class Spleen saunt- 
ered by, a suspicious glint in his 
eye. As soon as he turned the 
corner Bill leaned over and hiss- 
ed at Tembo. 



46 



GALAXY 



“How can we be anywhere 
else than where we started? Get- 
ting bigger, getting smaller 
doesn’t get us anyplace.” 

“Well. they’re pretty tricky 
with the old bloater 
drive. The way I heard it it’s 
like you take a rubber band and 
hold one end in each hand. You 
don’t move your left hand but 
you stretch the band out as far 
as it will go with your right hand. 
When you let the band shrink 
back again you keep your right 
hand steady and let go with your 
left. See? You never moved the 
rubber band, just stretched it 
and let it snap — but it has mov- 
ed over. Like our ship is doing 
now. It’s getting bigger, but in 
one direction. When the nose 
reaches wherever we’re going the 
stern will be wherever we were. 
Then we shrink and bango! there 
we are. And you can get into 
heaven just that easily, my son, 
if only . ” 

“Preaching on government 
time, Tembo!” First Class Spleen 
howled from the other side of 
the fuserack over which he was 
looking with a mirror tied to the 
end of a rod. “I’ll have you 
polishing fuseclips for a year. 
You’ve been warned before.” 

They tied and polished in si- 
lence after that, until a little 
planet about as big as a tennis 
ball swam in through the bulk- 



head. A perfect little planet with 
tiny icecaps, cold fronts, cloud 
cover, oceans and the works. 

“What’s that?” Bill yiped. 

“Bad navigation,” Tembo 
scowled. “Backlash, the ship is 
slipping back a little on one end 
instead of going all the other 
way. No-no! Don’t touch it, it 
can cause accidents sometimes. 
That’s the planet we just left, 
Phigerinadon II.” 

“My home,” Bill sobbed and 
felt the tears rise as the planet 
shrank to the size of a marble. 
“So long, Mom.” He waved as 
the marble shrunk to a mote 
then vanished. 

After this the journey was un- 
eventful, particularly since they 
could not feel when they were 
moving, did not know when they 
stopped, and had no idea where 
they were. Though they were 
sure they had arrived somewhere 
when they were orderd to strip 
the lashings from the fuses. The 
inaction continued for three 
watches and then the GENERAL 
QUARTERS alarm sounded. Bill 
ran with the others, happy for 
the first time since he had enlist- 
ed. All the sacrifices, the hard- 
ships would not be in vain. He 
was seeing action at last against 
the dirty Chingers. 

They stood in first position op- 
posite the fuseracks, eyes intent 
on the red bands on the fuses 
that were called the fusebands.

Through the soles of his boots 
Bill could feel a faint, distant 
tremor in the deck. 

“What’s that?” he asked Tem- 
bo out of the comer of his mouth. 

“Main drive, not the bloater 
drive. Atomic engines. Means we 
must be maneuvering, doing 
something.” 

“But what?” 

“Watch them fusebands!” 
First Class Spleen shouted. 

T)ill was beginning to sweat — 
then suddenly realized that 
it was becoming excruciatingly 
hot. Tembo, without taking his 
eyes from the fuses, slipped out 
of his clothes and folded them 
neatly behind him. 

“Are we allowed to do that?” 
Bill asked, pulling at his collar. 
“What’s happening?” 

“It’s against regulations but 
you have to strip or cook. Peel, 
son, or you will die unblessed. 
We must be going into action 
because the shields are up. Sev- 
enteen force screens, one elec- 
tromagnetic screen, a double ar- 
mored hull and a thin layer of 
pseudoliving jelly that flows over 
and seals any openings. With all 
that stuff there is absolutely no 
energy loss from the ship, nor 
any way to get rid of energy. Or 
heat. With the engines running 
and everyone sweating it can get 
pretty hot. Even hotter when the 
guns fire.” 



The temperature stayed high, 
just at the boundary of tolera- 
bility for hours, while they stared 
at the fusebands. At one point 
there was a tiny plink that Bill 
felt through his bare feet on the 
hot metal rather than heard. 
“What was that?” 

“Torpedoes being fired.” 

“At what?” 

Trembo just shrugged in an- 
swer and never let his vigilant 
gaze stray from the fusebands. 
Bill writhed with frustration, 
boredom, heat rash and fatigue 
for another hour, until the all 
clear blew and a breath of cool 
air came in from the ventilators. 
By the time he had pulled his 
uniform back on Tembo was 
gone and he trudged wearily 
back to his quarters. There was 
a new mimeographed notice pin- 
ned to the bulletin board in the 
corridor and he bent to read its 
blurred message.

verted ond this is WRONG and a 
COURT-MART I Ai OFFENSE that is pun- 
ishable by DEATH. 

VIII 

\ fter the heroic razing of 
'*"*• 17KL-345 there were weeks 
of training and drill to restore 
the battle-weary veterans to their 
usual fitness. But midway in 
these depressing months a new 
call sounded over the speakers, 
one Bill had never heard before, 
a clanging sound like steel bars 
being clashed together in a metal 
drum full of marbles. It meant 
nothing to him nor to the other 
new men, but it sent Tembo 
springing from his bunk to do 
a quick two step Death Curse 
Dance with tom-tom accompani- 
ment on his footlocker cover. 

“Are you around the bend?” 
Bill asked dully from where he 
sprawled reading a tattered copy 
of Real Ghoul Sexfiend Shocker 
Comics with built-in sound ef- 
fects. A ghastly moan was keen- 
ing from the page he was looking 
at. 

“Don’t you know?” Tembo 
asked. “Don’t you KNOW! 
That’s mail call, my boy, the 
grandest sound in space.” 

The rest of the watch was 
spent in hurrying up and waiting, 
standing in line and all the rest. 
Maximum inefficiency was at- 
tached to the delivery of the 
mail but finally, in spite of all 



barriers, the post was distributed 
and Bill had a precious special- 
postal from his mother. On one 
side of the card was a picture of 
the Noisome-Offal refinery just 
outside of his hometown, and this 
alone was enough to raise a lump 
in his throat. Then, in the tiny 
square allowed for the message, 
his mother’s scrawl had traced 
out: “Bad crop, in debt, robmule 
has packing glanders, hope you 
are the same — love, Maw.” 
Still, it was a message from home 
and he read and reread it as they 
stood in line for chow. Tembo, 
just ahead of him, also had a 
card, all angels and churches, 
just what you would expect, and 
Bill was shocked when he saw 
Tembo read the card one last 
time then plunge it into his cup 
of dinner. 

“What are you doing that for?” 
he asked, shocked. 

“What else is mail good for?” 
Tembo hummed, and poked the 
card deeper. “You just watch 
this now.” 

Before Biirs startled gaze, and 
right in front of his eyes, the 
card was starting to swell. The 
white surface broke off and fell 
away in tiny flakes while the 
brown insides grew and grew 
until they filled the cup and 
were an inch thick. Tembo fish- 
ed the dripping slab out and took 
a large bite from one corner. 

“Dehydrated chocolate,” he 

49 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



said indistinctly. “Good! Try 
yours.” 

TT'ven before he spoke Bill had 
*— t pushed his card down into 
the liquid and was fascinatingly 
watching it swell. The message 
fell away, but instead of brown 
a swelling white mass became 
visible. 

“Taffy — or bread maybe,” he 
said, and tried not to drool. 

The white mass was swelling, 
pushing against the sides of the 
cup, expanding out of the top. 
Bill grabbed the end and held it 
as it rose. Out and out it came 
until every drop of liquid had 
been absorbed and Bill held be- 
tween his outstretched hands a 
string of fat, connected letters 
over two yards long. VOTE- 
FOR - HONEST - GEEK - 
THE - TROOPERS - FRIEND 
they read. Bill leaned over and 
bit out an immense mouthful of 
T. He spluttered and spat the 
damp shards onto the deck. 

“Cardboard,” he said hollowly. 
“Mother always shops for bar- 
gains. Even in dehydrated choc- 
olate . .” He reached for his 
cup for something to wash the 
old newsprint taste out of his 
mouth but it was empty. 

S omewhere, high in the seats 
of power a decision was 
made, a problem resolved, an 
order issued. From small things 



do big things grow; a tiny bird 
terd lands on a snow- covered 
mountain slope, rolls, collects 
snow, becomes bigger and bigger, 
gigantic and more gigantic until 
it is a thundering mass of snow 
and ice, an avalanche, a ravening 
mass of hurtling death that wipes 
out an entire village. From small 
beginnings . Who knows what 
the beginning was here, perhaps 
the Gods do, but they are laugh- 
ing. Perhaps the haughty strut- 
ting peahen wife of some high 
minister saw a bauble she cher- 
ished and with shrewish, spiteful 
tongue exacerbated her peacock 
husband until, to give himself 
peace, he promised her the trin- 
ket, then sought the money for 
its purchase. Perhaps this was a 
word in the Emperor’s ear about 
a new campaign in the 77sub7th 
Zone, quiet now for years, a vic- 
tory there — or even a draw if 
there were enough deaths — 
would mean a medal, an award, 
some cash. And thus did a wom- 
an’s covetousness, like a tiny 
bird’s terd, start the snowball of 
warfare rolling, mighty fleets 
gathering, ship after ship as- 
sembling, like a rock in a pool of 
water the ripples spread until 
even the lowliest were touched 
by its motion . 

tCTX7'e’re heading for action,” 
’ ’ Tembo said as he sniff- 
ed at his cup of lunch. “They’re

loading up the chow with stimu- 
lants, pain depressors, saltpeter 
and antibiotics.” 

“Is that why they keep play- 
ing the patriotic music?” Bill 
shouted so that he could be heard 
over the endless roar of bugles 
and drums that poured from the 
speakers. Tembo nodded. 

“There’s little time left to be 
saved, to assure your place in 
Samedi’s legions — ” 

“Why don’t you talk to Bowb 
Brown?” Bill screamed. “I got 
tom-toms coming out of my ears! 
Every time I look at a wall I 
see angels floating by on clouds. 
Stop bothering me! Work on 
Bowb — anybody who would do 
what he does with thoats would 
probably join up with your Voo- 
doo mob in a second.” 

“I have talked with Brown 
about his soul, but the issue is 
still in doubt. He never answers 
me so I am not sure if he has 
heard me or not. But you are 
different, my son, you show an- 
ger which means you are show- 
ing doubt, and doubt is the first 
step to belief.” 

The music cut off in mid-peal 
and for three seconds there was 
an echoing blast of silence that 
abruptly terminated. 

“Now hear this. Attention all 
hands . stand by ... in a few 
moments we will be taking you

report from the admiral .

off by the sounding of General 
Quarters, but went on again when 
this hideous sound had ended. 

. and here we are on the 
bridge of that gigantic conquis- 
tadore of the spacelanes, the

ored, mightily gunned super 
battleship the Fairy Queen .

aside now and coming towards

platinum is the Grand Admiral 
of the Fleet, the Right Honor- 
able Lord Archaeopteryx . 
Could you spare us a moment 
Your Lordship? Wonderful! The 
next voice you are about to hear 
will be . .” 

The next voice was a burst of 
music while the fusemen eyed 
their fusebands, but the next 
voice after had all the rich ade- 
noidal tones always heard from 
peers of the empire. 

“Lads — we’re going into ac- 
tion! This, the mightiest fleet 
the galaxy has ever seen is head- 
ing directly towards the enemy 
to deliver the devasting blow 
that may win us the war. In my 
operations tank before me I see 
myriad pinpoints of light, stretch- 
ing as far as the eye can see and 
each point of light, I tell you 
they are like holes in a blanket!, 
is not a ship, not a squadron — 
but an entire fleet! We are 
sweeping forward, closing in . .” 



THE STARSLOGGERS

'T'he sound of tom-toms filled 
the air and on the fuseband 
that Bill was watching appeared 
a matched set of golden gates, 
swinging open. 

“Tembo!” he screamed. “Will 
you knock that off! I want to 
hear about the battle.” 

“Canned tripe,” Tembo sniff- 
ed. “Better to use the few re- 
maining moments of this life that 
may remain to you to seek sal- 
vation. That’s no admiral, that’s 
a canned tape. I’ve heard it five 
times already. They only play it 
to build morale before what they 
are sure is to be a battle with 
heavy losses. It never was an 
admiral, its from an old teevee 
program.” 

“Yippee!” Bill shouted and 
leaped forward. The fuse he was 
looking at crackled with a bril- 
liant discharge around the clips 
and at the same moment the 
fuseband charred and turned 
from red to black. “Unggh!” he 
grunted, then in rapid succes- 
sion, “Unggh! Unggh! Unggh!” 
burning his palms on the still hot 
fuse, dropping it on his toe, and 
finally getting it into a fuseway. 
When he turned back Tembo 
had already clipped a fresh fuse 
into the empty clips. 

“That was my fuse — you 
shouldn’t have . .” there were 
tears in his eyes. 

“Sorry. But by the rules I 
must help if I am free.” 

52 



“Well, at least we’re in action,” 
Bill said, back in position and 
trying to favor his bruised foot. 

“Not in action yet, still to cold 
in here. And that was just a fuse 
breakdown, you can tell by the 
clip discharge, they do that some- 
times when they get old.” 

“. massed armadas man- 
ned by heroic troopers . .” 
‘We could have been in com- 
bat.” Bill pouted. 

“. thunder of atomic broad- 
sides and lightning trails of hurt- 
ling torpedoes . .” 

“I think we are now. It does 
feel warmer, doesn’t it, Bill? We 
had better undress, if it really is 
a battle we may get too busy.” 
“Let’s go, let’s go, down to the 
buff,” First Class Spleen barked 
leaping gazelle-like down the 
rows of fuses, clad only in a pair 
of dirty gymsocks and his ta- 
tooed-on stripes and fouled fuse 
insignia of rank. There was a 
sudden crackling in the air and 
Bill felt the shortly clipped stubs 
of his hair stirring in his scalp. 
“What’s that?” he yi >ed. 

( 6 Qecondary discharge from 
^ that bank of fuses,” Tembo 
pointed. “It’s classified as to 
what is happening but I heard 
tell that it means one of the 
defense screens is under radia- 
tion attack and as it overloads it 
climbs up the spectrum to green, 
to blue to ultraviolet until fin- 



GALAXY 



ally it goes black and the screen 
breaks down.” 

“That sounds pretty way out.” 
“I told you it was just a ru- 
mor. The material is classified.” 
“THERE SHE GOES!!” 

A crackling bang split the hu- 
mid air of the fuseroom and a 
bank of fuses arced, smoked, 
burned black. One of them 
cracked in half, showering small 
fragments like shrapnel in every 
direction. The fusemen leaped, 
grabbed the fuses, slipped in re- 
placements with sweating hands, 
barely visible to each other 
through the reeking layers of 
smoke. The fuses were driven 
home and there was a moment’s 
silence, broken only by a plain- 
tive bleating from the communi- 
cations screen. 

“Son of a bowb!” First Class 
Spleen muttered, kicking a fuse 
out of the way and diving for 
the screen. His uniform jacket 
was hanging on a hook next to 
it, and he struggled into this be- 
fore banging the receive switch. 
He finished closing the last but- 
ton just as the screen cleared. 
Spleen saluted, so it must have 
been an officer he was facing. 
The screen was edge on to Bill 
so he couldn’t tell, but the voice 
had the quacking no-chin-and- 
plenty-of-teeth whine that he 
was beginning to associate with 
tiie officer class. 

“You’re slow in answering, 



First Class Spleen — maybe Sec- 
ond Class Spleen would be able 
to answer faster?” 

“Have pity, sir — I’m an old 
man.” He dropped to his knees 
in a prayerful attitude which 
took him off the screen. 

“Get up you idiot! Have you 
repaired the fuses after that last 
overload?” 

“We replace, sir, not repair." 
“None of your technical gib- 
berish, you swine! A straight 
answer!” 

“All in order, sir. Operating in 
the green. No complaints from 
anyone, your worship.” 

“Why are you out of uniform?” 
“I am in uniform, sir,” Spleen 
whined, moving closer to the 
screen so that his bare behind 
and shaking lower limbs could 
not be seen. 

“Don’t lie to me! There’s sweat 
on your forehead. You aren’t 
allowed to sweat in uniform. Do 
you see me sweating? And I 
have a cap on too — at the cor- 
rect angle. I’ll forget it this time 
because I have a heart of gold. 
Dismissed.” 

tt'E'ilthy bowb!” Spleen cursed 
JL at the top of his lungs, 
tearing the jacket from his stif- 
ling body. The temperature was 
over 120 and still rising. “Sweat! 
They have air-conditioning on 
the bridge — and where do you 
think they discharge the heat?

In here! YEOOWM” he cried. 

Two entire bands of fuses blew 
out at the same time, three of 
the fuses exploding like bombs. 
At the same moment the floor 
under their feet bucked hard 
enough to actually be felt. 

“Big trouble!” Tembo shouted. 
“Anything that is strong enough 
to feel through the stasis field 
must be powerful enough to flat- 
ten this ship like a pancake. 
There go some more!” He dived 
for the bank and kicked a fuse 
clear of the clips and jammed 
in a replacement. 

It was an inferno. Fuses were 
exploding like aerial bombs, 
sending whistling particles of 
ceramic death through the air. 
There was a lightning crackle as 
a board shorted to the metal 
floor and a hideous scream, 
thankfully cut short, as the sheet 
of lightning passed through a 
fusetender’s body. Greasy smoke 
boiled and hung in sheets making 
it almost impossible to see. Bill 
raked the remains of a broken 
fuse from the darkened clips and 
jumped for the replacement rack. 
He clutched the 90 pound fuse 
in his aching arms and had just 
turned back towards the boards 
•when the universe suddenly ex- 
ploded. 

All the remaining fuses seem- 
ed to have shorted at once and 
the screaming bolt of crackling 
electricity crashed the length of 



the room. In its eye-piercing light 
and in a single, eternal moment 
Bill saw the flame sear through 
the ranks of the fusetenders, 
throwing them about and incin- 
erating them like particles of 
dust in an open fire. Tembo 
crumpled and collapsed, a mass 
of seared flesh; a flying length 
of metal tore First Class Spleen 
open from neck to groin in a 
single hideous wound. 

“Look at that vent in Spleen!” 
Bowb shouted, then screamed as 
a ball of lightning rolled over 
him and turned him to a black- 
ened husk in a fraction of a sec- 
ond. 

B y chance, a mere accident, Bill 
was holding the solid bulk 
of the fuse before him when the 
flame struck. It washed over his 
left arm which was on the out- 
side of the fuse and hurled its 
flaming weight against the thick 
cylinder. The force hit Bill, 
knocked him back towards the 
reserve racks of fuses, and rolled 
him end over end flat on the 
floor while the all-destroying 
sheet of fire crackled inches 
above his head. It died away, as 
suddenly as it had come, leaving 
behind nothing but smoke, heat, 
the scorched smell of roasted 
flesh, destruction and death, 
death, death. Bill crawled pain- 
fully for the hatchway. Nothing 
else moved down the blackened

and twisted length of the fuse- 
room. 

The compartment below seem- 
ed just as hot, the air as bereft 
of nourishment for his lungs as 
the one he had just quitted. He 
crawled on, barely conscious of 
the fact that he moved on two 
lacerated knees and one bloody 
hand. His other arm just hung 
and dragged, a twisted and black- 
ened length of debris, and only 
the blessings of deep shock kept 
him from screaming with un- 
bearable pain. 

He crawled on, over a sill, 
through a passageway. The air 
was clearer here, and much cool- 
er: he sat up and inhaled its 
blessed freshness. The compart- 
ment was familiar — yet unfa- 
miliar — he blinked at it, trying 
to understand why. Long and 
narrow with a curved wall that 
had the butt ends of immense 
guns projecting from it. 

The main battery, of course, 
the guns Chinger spy Eager Bea- 
ger had photographed. Different 
now, the ceiling closer to the 
deck, bent and dented, as if 
some gigantic hammer had beat 
on it from the outside. There 
was a man slumped in the gun- 
ner’s seat of the nearest weapon. 

“What happened?” Bill asked, 
dragging himself over to the man 
and clutching him by the shoul- 
der. Surprisingly enough the 
gunner only weighed a few 



pounds and he fell from the seat 
light as a husk with a shriveled 
parchment face as though not 
a drop of liquid were left in his 
body. 

“Dehydrator ray,” Bill grunt- 
ed. “ thought they only had them 
on teevee.” The gunner’s seat 
was padded and looked very 
comfortable, far more so than 
the warped steel deck: Bill slid 
into the recently vacated posi- 
tion and stared with unseeing 
eyes at the screen before him. 
Little moving blobs of light. 

In large letters, just above the 
screen, was printed: GREEN 
LIGHTS OUR SHIPS, RED 
LIGHT ENEMY. FORGET- 
TING THIS IS A COURT- 
MARTIAL OFFENSE. 

“I won’t forget,” Bill mumbled 
as he started to slide sideways 
from the chair. To steady him- 
self he grabbed a large handle 
that rose before him, and when 
he did a circle of light with an 
X in it moved on the screen. It 
was very interesting. He put the 
circle around one of the green 
lights, then remembered some- 
thing about a court-martial of- 
fense. He jiggled it a bit and 
moved it over to a red light, with 
the X right over the light. There 
was a red button on top of the 
handle and he pressed it because 
it looked like the kind of button 
that is made to be pressed. The 
gun next to him went whffle . 



56 



GALAXY 



in a very subdued way and the 
red lights went out. Not very 
interesting, he let go of the 
handle. 

“Oh, but you are a fighting 
fool!” a voice said and, with 
some effort, Bill turned his head. 
A man stood in the doorway 
wearing a burned and tattered 
uniform still hung with shreds of 
gold braid. He weaved forward. 
“I saw it,” he breathed. “Until 
my dying day I won’t forget it. 
A fighting fool! What guts! Fear- 
less! Forward against the ene- 
my, no holds barred, don’t give 
up the ship . .” 

“What the bowb you talking 
about?” Bill asked thickly. 

“A hero!” the officer said 
pounding Bill on the back, which 
caused a great deal of pain and 
was the last straw for his con- 
scious mind which let go the 
reins of command and went away 
to sulk. Bill passed out. 

IX 

tCXTow won’t you be a nice 
’ trooper-wooper and drink 
your dinner . .” 

The warm notes of the voice 
insinuated themselves into a sin- 
gularly repulsive dream that Bill 
was only too glad to leave and, 
with a great deal of effort he 
managed to heave his eyes open. 
A quick bit of blinking got them 
into focus and he saw before 



him a cup on a tray held by a 
white hand that was attached to 
a white arm that was connected 
to a white uniform well stuffed 
with female breasts. With a gut- 
tural animal growl Bill knocked 
the tray aside and hurled him- 
self at the dress. He didn’t quite 
make it because his left arm was 
wrapped up in something and 
hung from wires, so that he spun 
around in the bed like an impal- 
ed beetle, still uttering harsh 
cries. The nurse shrieked and 
fled. 

“Glad to see that you are feel- 
ing better,” the doctor said, whip- 
ping him straight in the bed with 
a practiced gesture and numbing 
Bill’s still flailing right arm with 
a neat judo blow. “I’ll pour you 
some more dinner and you drink 
it right down, then we’ll let your 
buddies in for the unveiling, 
they’re all waiting outside.” 

The tingling was dying from 
his arm and he could wrap his 
fingers about the cup now. He 
sipped. “What buddies? What 
unveiling? What’s going on 
here?” he asked suspiciously. 

Then the door was opened and 
the troopers came in. Bill search- 
ed their faces, looking for bud- 
dies, but all he saw were ex- 
welders and strangers. Then he 
remembered. “Bowb Brown 
cooked!” he screamed. “Tembo 
broiled! First Class Spleen gut- 
ted! They’re all dead!” He hid

under the covers and moaned 
horribly. 

“That’s no way for a hero to 
act,” the doctor said, dragging 
him back onto the pillows and 
tucking the covers under his 
arms. “You’re a hero, trooper, 
the man whose guts, ingenuity, 
integrity, stick-to-itiveness, fight- 
ing spirit and deadly aim saved 
the ship. All the screens were 
down, the power room destroyed, 
the gunners dead, control lost 
and the enemy dreadnaught ze- 
roing in for the kill when you 
appeared like an avenging angel, 
wounded and near to death, and 
with your last conscious effort 
fired the shot heard round the 
fleet, the single blast that dis- 
emboweled the enemy and saved 
our ship, the grand old lady of 
the fleet Christine Keeler.” He 
handed a sheet of paper to Bill. 
“I am, of course, quoting from the 
official report, me myself I think 
it was just a lucky accident.” 

“You’re just jealous,” Bill 
sneered, already falling in love 
with his new image. 

tt'T'Xon’t get freudian with me!” 
the doctor screamed, then 
snuffled pitifully. “I always 
wanted to be a hero, but all I 
do is wait hand and foot on 
heroes. I’m taking that bandage 
off now.” 

He unclipped the wires that 
held up Bill’s arm and began to 

58 



unwind the bandages while the 
troopers crowded around to 
watch. 

“How is my arm, Doc?” Bill 
was suddenly worried. 

“Grilled like a chop. I had to 
cut it off.” 

“Then what is this?” Bill 
shrieked, horrified. 

“Another arm that I sewed 
on. There were lots of them left 
over after the battle. The ship 
had over 42 percent casualties 
and I was really cutting and 
chopping and sewing, I tell you.” 
The last bandage fell away and 
the troopers ahhhed with de- 
light. 

“Say, that’s a mighty fine 
arm!” 

“Make it do something.” 

“And a damn nice seam there 
at the shoulder — look how neat 
the stitches are!” 

“Plenty of muscles too and 
good and long, not like the 
crummy little short one he has 
on the other side.” 

“Longer and darker — that’s a 
great skin color!” 

“It’s Tembo’s arm!” Bill howl- 
ed. “Take it away!” He squirmed 
across the bed but the arm came 
after him. They propped him up 
again on the pillows. 

“You’re a lucky bowb. Bill, 
having a good arm like that. 
And your buddy’s arm too.” 
“We know that he wanted you 
to have it.” 



GALAXY 



“You’ll always have something 
to remember him by.” 

It really wasn’t a bad arm. Bill 
bent it and flexed the fingers 
still looking at it suspiciously. It 
felt alright. He reached out with 
it and grabbed a trooper’s arm 
and squeezed. He could feel the 
man’s bones grating together 
while he screamed and writhed. 
Then Bill looked closer at the 
hand and began to shout curses 
at the doctor. 

“You stupid sawbones! You 
thoat doctor! Some big job — 
this is a right arm!” 

“So it’s a right arm — so 
what?” 

“But you cut off my left arm! 
Now I have two right arms.” 
“Listen, there was a shortage 
of left arms. I’m no miracle 
worker. I do my best and all I 
get are complaints. Be happy I 
didn’t sew on a leg.” He leered 
evilly, “Or even better I didn’t 
sew on a . 

<CTt’s a good arm, Bill,” the 
A trooper said who was rub- 
bing his recently crushed fore- 
arm. “And you’re really lucky 
too. Now you can salute with 
either arm, no one else can do 
that.” 

“You’re right,” Bill said hum- 
bly. “I never thought of that. I’m 
really very lucky.” He tried a 
salute with his left-right arm and 
the elbow whipped up nicely 



across his chest and the finger- 
tips quivered at his eyebrow. All 
the troopers snapped to attention 
and returned the salute. The 
door crashed open and an officer 
poked his head in. 

“Stand easy, men — this is just 
an informal visit by the old 
man.” 

“Captain Zekial coming here!” 
“I’ve never seen the old man 
. .” The troopers chippered like 
birds and were as nervous as 
virgins at a defloration ceremony. 
Three more officers came 
through the door followed by a 
male nurse leading a ten-year- 
old moron wearing a bib and a 
captain’s uniform. 

“Uh . hi ya fellows . ” 
the captain said. 

“The captain wishes to pay his 
respects to you all,” the first 
lieutenant said crisply. 

“Is dat da guy in da bed?” 
“And particularly wishes to 
pay his personal respects to the 
hero of the hour.” 

“. Dere was sometin’ else 
but I forgot . .” 

“And he furthermore wishes to 
inform the valiant fighter who 
saved our ship that he is being 
raised in grade to Fusetender 
First Class, which increase in 
rank includes an automatic re- 
enlistment for seven years to be 
added to his original enlistment,

perial planet of Helior, there to

ula Cluster from the Emperor’s 
own hand.” 

. I think I gotta go to da 
bathroom . 

“But now the exigencies of 
command recall him to the 
bridge and he wishes you all an 
affectionate farewell.” 

Bill saluted with both arms 
and the troopers stood at atten- 
tion until the captain and his 
officers had gone, then the doc- 
tor dismissed the troopers as 
well. 

“Isn’t the old man a little 
young for his post?” Bill asked. 

“Not as young as some,” the 
doctor scratched through his hy- 
podermic needles looking for a 
particularly dull one for an in- 
jection. “You have to remember 
that all captains have to be of 
the nobility and even a large 
nobility gets stretched damn thin 
over a galactic empire. We take 
what we can get.” He found a 
crooked one and clipped it to 
the cylinder. 

“Affirm, so he’s young, but 
isn’t he also a little stupid for 
• the job?” 

“Watch that lese majesty stuff, 
bowb! You get an empire that’s 
a couple of thousand years old 
and you get a nobility that keeps 
inbreeding and you get some of 



the crunched genes and defective 
recessives coming out and you 
got a group of people that are 
a little more exotic than most 
nuthouses. There’s nothing wrong 
with the old man that a new 
I.Q. wouldn’t cure! You should 
have seen the captain of the last 
ship I was on . .” he shuddered 
and jabbed the needle viciously 
into Bill’s flesh. Bill screamed, 
then gloomily watched the blood 
drip from the hole after the hy- 
podermic had been withdrawn. 

The door closed and Bill was 
alone, looking at the blank wall 
and his future. He was a First 
Class Fusetender, and that was 
nice. But the compulsory re- 
enlistment for seven years was 
not so nice. His spirits dropped. 
He wished he could talk to some 
of his old buddies, then remem- 
bered that they were all dead 
and his spirits dropped even 
further. He tried to cheer him- 
self up but could think of noth- 
ing to be cheery about until he 
discovered that he could shake 
hands with himself. This made 
him feel a little bit better. 

He lay back on the pillows 
and shook hands with himself 
until he fell asleep. 

H ow easy is the fall from the 
pinnacle of power to the 
depths of degradation, for suc- 
cess and failure are but two sides 
of the same coin, one the obverse 



60 



GALAXY 



and the other the reverse, as the 
expression goes, and the shaking 
hand of fate flips this coin and 
no man knoweth on which side 
it will landeth. 

Fate flipped for Bill. The same 
fate that had guided his fingers 
to the trigger that destroyed the 
Chinger dreadnaught failed one 
day to guide his fingers on a 
more mundane mission. 

He received his medal — pin- 
ned on by the Emperor himself 
in a heart-warming ceremony — 
and as soon as the royal cortege 
had withdrawn the honor guard 
sprang on Bill and savaged him 
soundly. 

“Sacrilege!” a colonel of ma- 
rines roared as he sank his heel 
into Bill’s quivering kidney. 

“If you were one of my lads 
I’d have you blown from an 
atomic cannon!” screeched an 
artillery major as he mashed a 
fist against Bill’s ear. 

Unconscious and bleeding, Bill 
was finally dragged away by the 
MPs and locked behind bars. 
This was only the first of a series 
of military pokeys through which 
they shuttled his carcass while 
trying to make up their minds 
what to do with him. In transit 
he brushed against the criminal 
inhabitants of this secluded world 
and learned a form of low cun- 
ning that enabled him to survive 
with a minimum of effort. It was 
a pleasant, easy life, and in all 



ways superior to his existence 
as a trooper. 

X 

r I 'he transit stockade was a 
A makeshift building of plastic 
sheets bolted to bent aluminum 
frames and was in the center of 
a large quadrangle. MPs with 
bayoneted atom rifles marched 
around the perimeter of the six 
electrified barbed-wire fences. 
The multiple gates were opened 
by remote control and Bill was 
dragged through them by the 
handcuff robot that had brought 
him here. 

This debased machine was a 
squat and heavy cube as high as 
his knee that ran on clanking 
treads, and from the top of which 
projected a steel bar with heavy 
handcuffs fastened to the end. 
Bill was on the end of the hand- 
cuffs. Escape was impossible be- 
cause if any attempt was made 
to force the cuffs the robot sadis- 
tically exploded a peewee atom 
bomb it had in its guts and blew 
up itself and the escaping pris- 
oner, as well as anyone else in 
the vicinity. Once inside the com- 
pound the robot stopped and did 
not protest when the guard ser- 
geant unlocked the cuffs. As 
soon as its prisoner was freed 
the machine rolled into its ken- 
nel and vanished. 

“Alright wiseguy, you’re in my 

61 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



charge now, and dat means trou- 
ble for you,” the sergeant snap- 
ped at Bill. He had a shaven 
head, a wide and scar-covered 
jaw, small, close-set eyes in 
which there flickered the gut- 
tering candle of stupidity. 

Bill narrowed his own eyes to 
slits and slowly raised his good 
left-right arm, flexing the bicep. 
Tembo’s muscle swelled and 
split the thin prison fatigue jack- 
et with a harsh ripping sound. 
Then Bill pointed to the ribbon 
of the Purple Dart which he 
had pinned to his chest. 

“Do you know how I got that?” 
he asked in a grim and toneless 
voice. “I got that by killing 13 
Chingers single handed in a pill- 
box I had been sent into. I got 
into this stockade here because 
after killing the Chingers I came 
back and killed the sergeant who 
sent me in there. Now — what 
did you say about trouble, ser- 
geant?” 

“You don’t give me no trouble 
I don’t give you no trouble,” the 
guard sergeant squeaked as he 
skittered away. “You’re in cell 
13, in there, right upstairs . 
he stopped suddenly and began 
to chew all the fingernails on 
one hand at the same time, with 
a nibbling crunching sound. Bill 
gave him a long glower for good 
measure, then turned and went 
slowly into the building. 

The door to number 13 stood 



open and Bill looked in at the 
narrow cell, dimly lit by the light 
that filtered through the trans- 
lucent plastic walls. The double- 
decker bunk took up almost all 
of the space, leaving only a nar- 
row passage at one side. Two 
sagging shelves were bolted to 
the far wall and, along with the 
stenciled message BE CLEAN 
NOT OBSCENE — DIRTY 
TALK HELPS THE ENEMY!, 
made up the complete furnish- 
ings. A small man with a pointed 
face and beady eyes lay on the 
bottom bunk looking intently at 
Bill. Bill looked right back and 
frowned. 

U/^ome in, sarge,” the little 
^ man said as he scuttled up 
the support into the upper bunk. 
“I been saving the lower for 
you, yes I have. The name is 
Blackey and I’m doing ten 
months for telling a second looey 
to blow it out . 

He ended the sentence with a 
slight questioning note that Bill 
ignored. Bill’s feet hurt. He kick- 
ed off the purple boots and 
stretched out on the sack. Black - 
ey’s head popped over the edge 
of the upper bunk, not unlike a 
rodent peering out the land- 
scape. “It’s a long time to chow 
— how’s about a dobbinburger?” 
A hand appeared next to the 
head and slipped a shiny pack- 
age down to Bill.

GALAXY 



After looking it over suspi- 
ciously Bill pulled the sealing 
string on the end of the plastic 
bag. As soon as the air rushed 
in and hit the combustible lining 
the burger started to smoke and 
within three seconds was steam- 
ing hot. Lifting the bun Bill 
squirted ketchup in from the 
little sack at the other end of 
the bag, then took a suspicious 
bite. It was rich, juicy horse. 

“This old gray mare sure tastes 
like it used to be,” Bill said, talk- 
ing with his mouth full. “How 
did you ever smuggle this into 
the stockade?” 

Blackey grinned and produced 
a broad stage wink. “Contacts. 
They bring it in to me, all I 
gotta do is ask. I didn’t catch 
the name.” 

“Bill.” Food had soothed his 
ruffled temper. “I was sent up 
on an indeterminate sentence for 
a crime too hideous to mention.” 
“What was it?” Blackey licked 
his lips with anticipation. 

“I was given a medal by him- 
self, the Emperor, in person and 
the ceremony was broadcast live 
to 967 billion teevee sets.” 

“So what’s wrong with that?” 
“My fly was open.” 

Bill swallowed the last mouth- 
ful and wiped his fingers on 
the blanket. “That was a good 
burger, too bad there’s nothing 
to wash it down with.” 

Blackey produced a small bot- 



tle labeled COUGH SYPRUP 
and passed it to Bill. “Specially 
mixed for me by a friend in the 
medics. Half grain alcohol and 
half ether.” 

“Zoingg!” Bill said, dashing 
the tears from his eyes after 
draining half the bottle. He felt 
almost at peace with the world. 
“You’re a good buddy to have 
around, Blackey.” 

“You can say that again,” 
Blackey told him earnestly. “It 
never hurts to have a buddy, 
not in the troopers, the army, 
the navy, anywheres. Ask old 
Blackey, he knows. You got mus- 
cles, Bill?” 

T)ill lazily flexed Tembo’s mus- 
cle for him. 

“That’s what I like to see,” 
Blackey said in admiration. 
“With your muscles and my 
brain we can get along fine . .” 
“I have a brain too!” 

“Relax it! Give it a break, 
while I do the thinking. I seen 
service in more armies than you 
got days in the troopers. I got 
my first purple heart serving 
with Hannibal, there’s the scar 
right there,” he pointed to a 
white arc on the back of his 
hand. “But I picked him for a 
loser and switched to Romulus 
and Remus’s boys while there 
was still time. I been learning 
ever since and I always land on 
my feet. I saw which way the

wind was blowing and ate some 
laundry soap and got the trots 
the morning of Waterloo, and I 
missed but nothing I tell you. I 
saw the same kind of thing shap- 
ing up at the Somme — or was 
it Ypres? — I forget some of 
them old names now, and chew- 
ed a cigarette and put it into 
my armpit. You get a fever that 
way, and missed that show too. 
There’s always an angle to figure 
I always say.” 

“I never heard of those bat- 
tles. Fighting the Chingers?” 

“No, earlier than that, a lot 
earlier than that. Wars and wars 
ago.” 

“That makes you pretty old, 
Blackey. You don’t look pretty 
old.” 

“I am pretty old, but I don’t 
tell people usually because they 
give me the laugh. But I remem- 
ber the pyramids being built, and 
I remember what lousy chow the 
Assyrian army had, and the time 
we took over Wug’s mob when 
they tried to get into our cave, 
rolled rocks down on them.” 

“Sounds like a lot of bowb,” 
Bill said lazily, draining the bot- 
tle. 

. “Yeah, that’s what everybody 
says, so I don’t tell the old stor- 
ies anymore. They don’t even 
believe me when I show them 
my good luck piece.” He held 
out a little white triangle with 
a ragged edge. “Tooth from a 



pterodactyl. Knocked it down 
myself with a stone from a sling 
I had just invented.” 

“Looks like a hunk of plastic.” 
“See what I mean? So I don’t 
tell the old stories anymore. Just 
keep re-enlisting and drifting 
with the tide.” 

Bill sat up and gaped. “Re- 
enlist! Why, that’s suicide . 

“Safe as houses. Safest place 
during the war is in the army. 
The jerks in the front lines get 
their asses shot off, the civilians 
at home get their asses blown 
off. Guys in between safe as 
houses. It takes 30, 50 maybe 70 
guys in the middle to supply 
every guy in the line. Once you 
learn to be a fileclerk you’re 
saft. Who ever heard of them 
shooting at a fileclerk? I’m a 
great fileclerk. But that’s just 
in wartime. Peacetime, whenever 
they make a mistake and there 
is peace for awhile, it’s better to 
be in the combat troops. Better 
food, longer leaves, nothing much 
to do. Travel a lot.” 

“So what happens when the 
war starts?” 

“I know 735 different ways to 
get into the hospitals.” 

“Will you teach me a couple?” 
“Anything for a buddy, Bill. 
I’ll show you tonight, after they 
bring the chow around. And the 
guard what brings the chow is 
being difficult about a little fa- 
vor I asked him. Boy, I wish he

had a broken arm!” he sighed. 

‘‘Which arm?” Bill cracked his 
knuckles with a loud, rending 
crunch. 

‘‘Dealer’s choice.” 

'~phe Plastichouse Stockade was 
a transient center where pri- 
soners were kept on the way 
from somewhere to elsewhere. It 
was an easy, relaxed life enjoyed 
by both guards and inmates with 
nothing to disturb the even ten- 
or of the days. There had been 
one new guard, a real eager type 
fresh in from the National Ter- 
ritorial Guard, but he had had 
an accident while serving the 
meals and had broken his arm. 
Even the other guards were glad 
to see him go. About once a week 
Blackey would be taken away 
under armed guard to the Base 
Records Section where he was 
forging new records for a light 
colonel who was very active in 
the black market and wanted to 
make millionaire before he re- 
tired. While working on the re- 
cords Blackey saw to it that the 
stockade guards received unde- 
served promotions, extra leave 
time and cash bonuses for non- 
existent medals. As a result Bill 
and Blackey ate and drank very 
well and grew fat. It was as 
peaceful as could possibly be 
until the morning after a session 
in the records section when 
Blackey returned and woke Bill, 



“Good news,” he said. “We’re 
shipping out.” 

“What’s good about that?” Bill 
asked, surly at being disturbed 
and still half stoned from the 
previous evening’s drinking bout. 
“I like it here.” 

“It’s going to get too hot for 
us soon. The colonel is giving me 
the eye and a very funny look 
and I think he is going to have 
us shipped to the other end of 
the galaxy where there is heavy 
fighting. But he’s not going to 
do anything until next week 
after I finish the books for him, 
so I had secret orders cut for 
us this week sending us to Tabes 
Dorsalis where the cement mines 
are.” 

“The dust world!” Bill shouted 
hoarsely and picked Blackley up 
by the throat and shook him. “A 
worldwide cement mine where 
men die of silicosis in hours. Hell 
hole of the universe . .” 

Blackey wriggled free and 
scuttled to the other end of the 
cell. 

“Hold it!” he gasped. “Don’t 
go off half cocked. Close the 
cover on your priming pan and 
keep your powder dry! Do you 
think I would ship us to a place 
like that? That’s just the way 
it is on the teevee shows, but I 
got the inside dope. If you work 
in the cement mines, roger, it 
ain’t so good. But they got one 
tremendous base section there

with a lot of clerical help and 
they use trustees in the motor 
pool since there aren’t enough 
troops there. While I was work- 
ing on the records I changed 
your MS from fusetender which 
is a suicide job to driver, and 
here is your drive’s license with 
qualifications on everything from 
a monocycle to an atomic 89-ton 
tank. So we get us some soft 
jobs and besides, the whole base 
is air-conditioned.” 

“It was kind of nice here,” 
Bill said, scowling at the plas- 
tic card that certified to his ap- 
titude in chauffeuring a number 
of strange vehicles most of which 
he had never seen. 

“They come, they go, they’re 
all the same,” Blackey said, 
packing a small toilet kit. 

They began to realize that 
something was wrong when the 
column of prisoners were shackl- 
ed then chained together with 
neckcuffs and leg irons and prod- 
ded into the transport spacer by 
a platoon of combat MPs. “Move 
along!” they shouted. “You’ll 
have plenty of time to relax 
when we get to Tabes Dorsal- 
gia.” 

• “Where are we going?” Bill 
gasped. 

“You heard me, snap it bowb.” 

“You told me Tabes Dorsalis,” 
Bill snarled at Blackey who was 
ahead of him in the chain. 
“Tabes Dorsalgia is the base on 



Veneria where all the fighting is 
going on — we’re heading for 
combat!” 

“A little slip of the pen,” 
Blackey sighed. “You can’t win 
them all.” 

He dodged the kick Bill swung 
at him then waited patiently 
while the MPs beat Bill sense- 
less with their clubs and drag- 
ged him aboard the ship.

no place for labor camp prisoners 
to escape to, and Bill wheeled 
around looking for Blackey, the 
fingers of Tembo’s arm snapping 
like hungry jaws. Then he re- 
membered that Blackey had 
spoken to one of the guards as 
they were leaving the ship, had 
slipped him something, and a 
little while later had been un- 
locked from the line and led 
away. By now he would be run- 
ning the file section and by to- 
morrow he would be living in 
the nurse’s quarters. 

Bill sighed, let the whole thing 
slip out of his mind and vanish 
since it was just one more an- 
tangonistic factor that he had no 
control over and dropped down 



onto the nearest bunk. Instantly 
a vine flashed up from a crack 
in the floor, whipped four times 
around the bunk lashing him se- 
curely to it, then plunged ten- 
drils into his leg and began to 
drink his blood. 

“Grrrrk . .” Bill croaked 
against the pressure of a green 
loop that tightened around his 
throat. 

“Never lie down without you 
got a knife in your hand,” a 
thin, yellowish sergeant said as 
he passed by and severed the 
vine, with his own knife, where 
it emerged from the floorboards. 

“Thanks, sarge,” Bill said, 
stripping off the coils and throw- 
ing them out the window. 



THE STARSLOGGERS

The sergeant suddenly began 
vibrating like a plucked string 
and dropped onto the foot of 
Bill’s bunk. “P-pocket . shirt 
. p-p- pills . he stuttered 
through chattering teeth. Bill 
pulled a plastic box of pills out 
of the sergeant’s pocket and 
forced some of them into his 
mouth. The vibrations stopped 
and the man sagged back against 
the wall, gaunter and yellower 
and streaming with sweat. 

(t Taundice and swamp fever 
•I and galloping filariasis, 
never know when an attack will 
hit me, that’s why they can’t 
send me back to combat, I can’t 
hold a gun. Me, Master Sergeant 
Ferkel, the best damned flame 
thrower in Kirjassoff’s Kut- 
throats, and they have me play- 
ing nursemaid in a prison labor 
camp. So you think that bugs 
me? It does not bug me, it 
makes me happy, and the only 
thing that would make me hap- 
pier would be shipping off this 
cesspool planet at once.” 

“Do you think alcohol will 
hurt your condition?” Bill asked, 
passing over a bottle of cough 
syrup. “It’s kind of rough here?” 
“Not only won’t hurt it but 
it will.” There was a deep gur- 
gling and when the sergeant 
spoke again he was hoarser but 
stronger. “Rough is not the word 
for it. Fighting the Chingers is 



bad enough, but on this planet 
they have the natives, the Ven- 
ians, on their side. These Ven- 
ians look like moldy newts and 
they got just maybe enough IQ 
to hold a gun and pull the trig- 
ger, but it is their planet and 
they’re murder out there in the 
swamps. They hide under the 
mud and they swim under the 
water and they swing from the 
trees and the whole planet is 
thick with them. They got no 
sources of supply, no army divi- 
sions, no organizations, they just 
fight. If one dies the others eat 
him. If one is wounded in the 
leg the others eat the leg and he 
grows a new one. If one of them 
runs out of ammunition or poi- 
son darts or whatever he just 
swims back a hundred miles to 
base, loads up and back to bat- 
tle. We have been fighting here 
for three years and we now con- 
trol one hundred square miles of 
territory.” 

“A hundred, that sounds like 
a lot.” 

“Just to a stupid bowb like 
you. That is ten miles by ten 
miles, and maybe about two 
square miles more than we cap- 
tured in the first landings.” 

There was the squish -thud of 
tired feet and weary, mud-soak- 
ed men began to drag into the 
barracks. Sergeant Ferkel haul- 
ed himself to his feet and blew 
a long blast on his whistle.

“Alright you new men, now 
hear this. You have all been as- 
signed to B squad which is now 
assembling in the compound, 
which squad will now march out 
into the swamp and finish the 
job these shagged creeps from A 
squad began this morning. You 
will do a good days work out 
there. I am not going to appeal 
to your sense of loyalty, your 
honor or your sense of duty . 
Ferkel whipped out his atomic 
pistol and blew a hole in the 
ceiling through which rain began 
to drip. “I am only going to 
appeal to your urge to survive, 
because any man shirking, goof- 
ing off or not pulling his own 
weight will personally be shot 
dead by me. Now get out.” With 
his bared teeth and shaking 
hands he looked sick enough and 
mean enough and mad enough 
to do it. Bill and the rest of B 
squad rushed out into the rain 
and formed ranks. 

4 4T)ick up da axes, pick up da 
A picks, get the uranium 
out,” the corporal of the armed 
guard snarled as they squelched 
through the mud towards the 
gate. The labor squad, carrying 
their tools, stayed in the center, 
while the armed guard walked 
on the outside. The guard wasn’t 
there to stop the prisoners from 
escaping but to give some mea- 
sure of protection from the ene- 



my. They dragged slowly down 
the road of felled trees that 
wound through the swamp. 
There was a sudden whistling 
overhead and heavy transports 
flashed by. 

“We’re in luck today,” one of 
the older prisoners said, “they’re 
sending in the heavy infantry 
again. I didn’t know they had 
any left.” 

“You mean they’ll capture 
more territory?” Bill asked. 

“Naw, all they’ll get is dead. 
But while they’re getting butch- 
ered some of the pressure will 
be off of us and we can maybe 
work without losing too many 
men.” 

Without orders they all stop- 
ped to watch as the heavy in- 
fantry fell like rain into the 
swamps ahead — and vanished 
just as easily as raindrops. Every 
once in awhile there would be a 
boom and flash as a teensie 
A-bomb went off, which prob- 
ably atomized a few Venians, 
but there were billions more of 
the enemy just waiting to rush 
in. Small arms crackled in the 
distance and grenades boomed. 
Then over the trees they saw a 
bobbing, bouncing figure ap- 
proach. It was a heavy infantry- 
man in his armored suit and 
gasproof helmet, A-bombs and 
grenades strapped to him, a reg- 
ular walking armory. Or rather 
hopping armory, since he would

have had trouble walking on a 
paved street with the weight of 
junk hung about him, so there- 
fore moved by jumping, using 
two reaction rockets, one bolted 
to each hip. His hops were get- 
ting lower and lower as he came 
near. He landed 50 yards away 
ana sank slowly to his waist in 
the swamp, his rockets hissing 
as they touched the water. Then 
he hopped again, much shorter 
this time, the rockets fizzling and 
popping, and he threw his hel- 
• met open in the air. 

“Hey, guys,” he called. “The 
dirty Chingers got my fuel tank. 
My rockets are almost out, I 
can’t hop much more. Give a 
buddy a hand will you . .” He 
hit the water with a splash. 

“Get outta the monkey suit 
and we’ll pull you in,” the guard 
corporal called. 

“Are you nuts!” the soldier 
shouted. “It takes an hour to 
get into and outta this thing.” 
He triggered his rockets but 
they just went pffft and he rose 
about a foot in the water, then 
dropped back. “The fuel’s gone! 
Help me you bastards! What’s ‘ 
this, bowb-your-buddy week . .” 
he shouted as he sank, then his 
‘ head went under and there were 
a few bubbles and nothing else. 

“It’s always bowb-your-buddy 
week,” the corporal said. “Get 
the column moving!” he ordered, 
and they shuffled forward. 



“Them suits weigh 3,000 pounds. 
Goes down like a rock,” the cor- 
poral said as he prodded them 
ahead. 

I f this was a quiet day, Bill 
didn’t want to see a busy 
one. Since the entire planet of 
Veneria was a swamp no ad- 
vances could be made until a 
road was built. Individual sol- 
diers might penetrate a bit ahead 
of the road, but for equipment or 
supplies or even heavily armed 
men a road was necessary. 
Therefore the labor corps was 
building a road of felled trees. 
At the front. 

Bursts from atom rifles steam- 
ed in the water around them and 
the poison darts were as thick 
as falling leaves. The firing and 
sniping on both sides was con- 
stant while the prisoners cut 
down trees, trimmed and lashed 
them together to push the road 
forward another few inches. Bill 
trimmed and chopped and tried 
to ignore the screams and falling 
bodies until it began to grow 
dark. The squad, now a good 
deal smarter, made their return 
march in the dusk. 

“We pushed it ahead at least 
30 yards this afternoon,” Bill 
said to the old prisoner march- 
ing at his side. 

“Don’t mean nothing, Venians 
swim up in the night and take 
the logs away.”

GALAXY 



Bill instantly made his mind 
up to get out of there. 

“Got any more of that joy- 
juice?” Sergeant Ferkel asked 
when Bill dropped onto his bunk 
and began to scrape some of 
the mud from his boots with the 
blade of his knife. Bill took a 
quick slash at a plant coming up 
through the floorboards before 
he answered. 

“Do you think you could spare 
me a moment to give me some 
advice, sergeant?” 

“I am a flowing fountain of 
advice once my throat is lubri- 
cated.” 

Bill dug a bottle out of his 
pocket. “How do you get out 
of this outfit?” he asked. 

“You get killed,” the sergeant 
told him as he raised the bottle 
to his lips. Bill snatched it out 
of his hand. 

“That I know without your 
help,” he snarled. 

“Well that’s all you gonna 
know without my help,” the ser- 
geant snarled back. 

Their noses were touching and 
they growled at each other deep 
in their throats. Having proven 
just where they stood and just 
how tough they both were they 
relaxed, and Sergeant Ferkel 
leaned back while Bill sighed and 
passed him the bottle. 

UT Tow’s about a job in the 
orderly room?” 



“We don’t have an orderly 
room. We don’t have any rec- 
ords. Everyone sent here gets 
killed sooner or later, so who 
cares exactly when.” 

“What about getting wound- 
ed?” 

“Get sent to the hospital, get 
well, get sent back here.” 

“The only thing left to do is 
mutiny!” Bill shouted. 

“Didn’t work last four times 
we tried it. They just pulled the 
supply ships out and didn’t give 
us any food until we agreed to 
start fighting again. Wrong chem- 
istry here, all the food on this 
planet is pure poison for our 
metabolisms. We had a couple 
of guys prove it the hard way. 
Any mutiny that is going to suc- 
ceed has to grab enough ships 
first so we can get off-planet. If 
you got any good ideas about 
that I’ll put you in touch with 
the Permanent Mutiny Commit- 
tee.” 

“Isn’t there any way to get 
out?” 

“I anshered that firsht,” Fer- 
kel told him and fell over stone 
drunk. 

“I’ll see for myself,” Bill said 
as he slid the sergeant’s pistol 
from his holster and slipped out 
the back door. 

Armored floodlights lit up the 
forward positions facing the ene- 
my and Bill went in the opposite 
direction, towards the distant 



THE STARSLOGGERS

white flares of landing rockets. 
Barracks and warehouses were 
dotted about on the boggy ground 
but Bill stayed clear of them 
since they were all guarded, and 
the guards had itchy trigger fin- 
gers. They fired at anything they 
saw, anything they heard, and 
if they didn’t see or hear any- 
thing they fired once in awhile 
anyway just to keep their morale 
up. Lights were burning brightly 
ahead and Bill crawled forward 
on his stomach to peer from be- 
hind a rank growth at a tall, 
floodlighted fence of barbed wire 
that stretched out of sight in both 
directions. 

A burst from an atomic rifle 
burned a hole in the mud about 
a yard behind him and a search- 
light swung over, catching him 
full in its glare. 

“Greetings from your com- 
manding officer,” an amplified 
voice thundered from loudspeak- 
ers on the fence. “This is a re- 
corded announcement. You are 
now attempting to leave the com- 
bat zone and enter the restricted 
headquarters zone. This is for- 
bidden. Your presence has been 
detected by automatic machin- 
ery- and these same devices now 
have a number of guns trained 
upon you. They will fire in sixty 
seconds if you do not leave. Be 
patriotic, man! Do your duty. 
Death to the Chingers! Fifty-five 
seconds. Would you like your 



mother to know that her boy is 
a coward? Fifty seconds. Your 
Emperor has invested a lot of 
money in your training — is this 
the way you repay him? Forty - 
five seconds . 

Bill cursed and shot up the 
nearest loudspeaker but the voice 
continued from others down the 
length of the fence. He turned 
and went back the way he had 
come. 

As he neared his barracks, 
skirting the front line to avoid 
fire from the nervous guards in 
the buildings, all the lights went 
out. At the same time gunfire 
and bomb explosions broke out 
on every side. 

XII 

S omething slithered close by in 
the mud and Bill’s trigger 
finger spontaneously contracted 
and he shot it. In the brief atom- 
ic flare he saw the smoking re- 
mains of a dead Venian, as well 
as an unusually large number 
of live Venians squelching to the 
attack. Bill dived aside instant- 
ly, so that their return fire miss- 
ed him, and fled in the opposite 
direction. His only thought was 
to save his skin and this he did 
by getting as far from the firing 
and the attacking enemy as he 
could. That this direction hap- 
pened to be into the trackless 
swamp he did not consider. 



72 



GALAXY 



Survive his shivering little ego 
screamed and he ran on into the 
swamp. 

Running became difficult when 
the ground turned to mud, and 
even more difficult when the 
mud gave way to open water. 
After paddling desperately for 
an interminable length of time 
Bill came to more mud. The 
first hysteria had now passed, 
the firing was only a dull rumble 
in the distance and he was ex- 
hausted. He dropped onto the 
mudbank and instantly sharp 
teeth sank into his buttocks. 
Screaming hoarsely he ran on 
until he ran into a tree. He 
wasn’t going fast enough to hurt 
himself and the feel of rough 
bark under his fingers brought 
out all of his eoanthropic survi- 
val instincts: he climbed. 

High up there were two 
branches that forked out from 
the trunk and he wedged himself 
into the crotch, back to the solid 
wood and gun pointed straight 
ahead and ready. Nothing both- 
ered him now and the night 
sounds grew dim and distant, the 
blackness was complete and 
within a few minutes his head 
started to nod. He dragged it 
back a few times, blinked about 
at nothing, then finally slept 
soundly. 

It was the first gray light of 
dawn when he opened his gum- 
my eyes and blinked around. 



There was a little lizard perch- 
ed on a nearby branch watching 
him with jewel-like eyes. 

“Gee — you were really sack- 
ed out,” the Chinger said. 

Bill’s shot tore a smoking scar 
in the top of the branch, then 
the Chinger swung back up from 
underneath and meticulously 
wiped bits of ash from his paws. 

“Easy on the trigger, Bill,” 
it said. “Gee — I could have 
killed you anytime during the 
night if I had wanted to.” 

“I know you,” Bill said hoarse- 
ly. “You’re Eager Beager, aren’t 
you.” 

— this is just like old 

'-J home week, isn’t it.” A 
centipede was scuttling by and 
Eager Beager the Chinger grab- 
bed it up with three of his arms 
and began pulling off legs with 
his fourth and eating them. “I 
recognized you Bill, and wanted 
to talk to you. I’ve been feeling 
bad ever since I called you a 
stoolie, that wasn’t right of me. 
You were only doing your duty 
when you turned me in. You 
wouldn’t like to tell me how 
you recognized me, would you?” 
he asked, and winked slyly. 

“Why don’t you bowb off, 
Jack?” Bill growled and groped 
in his pocket for a bottle of 
cough syrup. Eager Chinger 
sighed. 

“Well, I suppose I can’t ex- 

73 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



pect you to betray anything of 
military importance, but I hope 
you will answer a few questions 
for me.” He discarded the de- 
limbed corpse and groped about 
in his marsupial pouch and pro- 
duced a tablet and tiny writing 
instrument. “You must realize 
that spying is not my chosen oc- 
cupation, but rather I was dra- 
gooned into it through my spe- 
cialty which is exopology — per- 
haps you have heard of this dis- 
cipline?” 

“We had an orientation lecture 
once, an exopologist, all he could 
talk about was alien creeps and 
things.” 

“Yes — well that roughly sums 
it up. The science of the study 
of alien life forms, and of course 
to us you homo sapiens are an 
alien form.” He scuttled halfway 
around the branch when Bill 
raised his gun. 

“Watch that kind of talk, 
bowb!” 

“Sorry, just my manner of 
speaking. To put it briefly, since 
I specialized in the study of 
your species I was sent out as 
a spy, reluctantly, but that is the 
sort of sacrifice one makes dur- 
ing wartime. However, seeing 
you here reminded me that there 
are a number of questions and 
problems still unanswered that I 
would appreciate your help on, 
purely in the matter of science, 
of course.” 



“Like what?” Bill asked sus- 
piciously, draining the bottle and 
flinging it away into the jungle. 

“Well — gee — to begin sim- 
ply, how do you feel about us 
Chingers?” 

“Death to all Chingers!” The 
little pen flew over the tablet. 

“But you have been taught 
to say that. How did you feel 
before you entered the service?” 
“Didn’t give a damn about 
Chingers.” Out of the corner of 
his eye Bill was watching a sus- 
picious movement of the leaves 
in the tree above. 

“Fine! Then could you explain 
to me just who it is that hates 
us Chingers and wants to fight 
a war of extermination?” 

“Nobody really hates Ching- 
ers, I guess. It’s just that there 
is no one else around to fight a 
war with so we fight with you.” 
The moving leaves had parted 
and a great, smooth head with 
slitted eyes peered down. 

ttT knew it! And that brings 
A me to my really impor- 
tant questions. Why do you homo 
sapiens like to fight wars?” 
Bill’s hand tightened on his 
gun as the monstrous head drop- 
ped silently down from the 
leaves behind Eager Chinger 
Beager. It was attached to a 
foot-thick and apparently end- 
less serpent body. 

“Fight wars? I don’t know,” 



74 



GALAXY 



Bill said, distracted by the 
soundless approach of the giant 
snake. “I guess because we like 
to, there doesn’t seem to be any 
other reason.” 

“You like to!” the Chinger 
squeaked, hopping up and down 
with excitement. “No civilized 
race could like wars, death, kill- 
ing, maiming, rape, torture, pain 
to name just a few of the con- 
comitant factors. Your race can’t 
be civilized!” 

The snake struck like light- 
ning and Eager Beager Chinger 
vanished down its spine-covered 
throat with only the slightest of 
muffled squeals. 

“Yeah ... I guess we’re just 
not civilized,” Bill said, gun 
ready, but the snake kept going 
on down. At least fifty yards of 
it slithered by before the tail 
flipped past and it was out of 
sight. “Serves the damn spy 
right,” Bill grunted happily and 
pulled himself to his feet. 

Once on the ground Bill began 
to realize just how bad a spot 
he was in. The damp swamp had 
swallowed up any marks of his 
passage from the night before 
and he hadn’t the slightest idea 
in which direction the battle area 
lay. The sun was just a general 
illumination behind the layers of 
fog and cloud, and he felt a sud- 
den chill as he realized how 
small were his chances of find- 
ing his way back. The invasion 



area, just ten miles to a side, 
made a microscopic pinprick in 
the hide of this planet. Yet if he 
didn’t find it he was as good as 
dead. And if he just stayed here 
he would die, so, picking what 
looked like the most likely direc- 
tion, he started off. 

“I’m pooped,” he said, and 
was. A few hours of dragging 
through the swamps had done 
nothing except weaken his mus- 
cles, fill his skin with insect 
bites, drain a quart or two of 
blood into the ubiquitous leeches 
and deplete the charge in his 
gun as he killed a dozen or so 
of the local lifeforms that want- 
ed him for breakfast. He was 
also hungry and thirsty. And 
still lost. 

The rest of the day just re- 
capitulated the morning so that 
when the sky began to darken 
he was close to exhaustion and 
his supply of cough medicine 
was gone. He was very hungry 
when he climbed a tree to find 
a spot to rest for the night and 
he plucked a luscious looking red 
fruit. 

“Supposed to be poison,” he 
looked at it suspiciously, then 
smelled it. It smelled fine. He 
threw it away. 

In the morning he was much 
hungrier. “Should I put the bar- 
rel of the gun in my mouth and 
blow my head off?” he asked 
himself, weighing the atomic 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



75 



pistol in his hand. “Plenty of 
time for that yet. Plenty of 
things can still happen,” yet he 
didn’t really believe it. Suddenly 
he heard voices coming through 
the jungle towards him, human 
voices. He settled behind the 
limb and aimed his gun in that 
direction. 

Ophe voices grew, then a clank- 
ing and rattling. An armed 
Venian scuttled under the tree, 
but Bill held his fire as other 
figures loomed out of the fog. 
It was a long file of human pris- 
oners wearing the neckirons used 
to bring Bill and the others to 
the labor camp, all joined togeth- 
er by a long chain that connect- 
ed the neckirons. Each of the 
men was carrying a large box 
on his head. Bill let them stum- 
ble by underneath and kept a 
careful count of the Venian 
guards. There were five in all 
With a sixth bringing up the 
rear. 

When this one had passed un- 
derneath the tree Bill dropped 
straight down on him, braining 
him with his heavy boots. The 
Venian was armed with a Chin- 
ger-made copy of a standard 
atomic rifle and Bill smiled wick- 
edly as he hefted its familiar 
weight. After sticking the pistol 
into his waistband he crept after 
the column, rifle ready. He man- 
aged to kill the fifth guard by 



walking up behind him and 
catching him in the back of the 
neck with the rifle butt. The 
last two troopers in the file saw 
this but had enough brains to 
be quiet as he crept up on num- 
ber four. Some stir among the 
prisoners or a chance sound 
warned this guard and he turned 
about, raising his rifle. There 
was no chance now to kill him 
silently so Bill burned his head 
off and ran as fast as he could 
towards the head of the column. 
There was a shocked silence 
when the blast of the rifle echo- 
ed through the fog and Bill filled 
it with a shout. 

“Hit the dirt — FAST!” 

The soldiers dived into the 
mud and Bill held his atomic 
rifle at his waist as he ran, fan- 
ning it back and forth before 
him like a water hose and hold- 
ing the trigger on full automatic. 
A continuous blast of fire pour- 
ed out a yard above the ground 
and he squirted it in an arc be- 
fore him. There were shouts and 
screams in the fog and then the 
charge in the rifle was exhaust- 
ed. Bill threw it from him and 
drew the pistol. Two of the re- 
maining guards were down and 
the last one was wounded and 
got off a single badly aimed shot 
before Bill burned him too. 

“Not bad,” he said, stopping 
and panting. “Six out of six.” 

There were low moans coming 



76 



GALAXY 



from the line of prisoners and 
Bill curled his lip in disgust at 
the three men who hadn’t drop- 
ped at his shouted command. 

“What’s the matter?” he ask*, 
ed, stirring one with his foot, 
“never been in combat before?” 
But this one didn’t answer be- 
cause he was charred dead. 

tC XT ever . .” the next one 
-*■ answered, gasping in 
pain. “Get the corpsman, I’m 
wounded, there’s one ahead in 
the line. Oh, oh, why did I ever 
leave the Chris’ Keeler! Medic.” 
Bill frowned at the three gold 
balls of a fourth lieutenant on 
the man’s collar, then bent and 
scraped some mud from his face. 
“You! The laundry officer!” he 
shouted in outraged anger, rais- 
ing his gun to finish the job. 

“Not I!” the lieutenant moan- 
ed, recognizing Bill at last. “The 
laundry officer is gone, flushed 
down the drain! This is I, your 
friendly local pastor, bringing 
you the blessings of Ahura Maz- 
dah, my son, and have you been 
reading the Avesta every day 
before going to sleep?” 

“Bah!” Bill snarled, he 
couldn’t shoot him now, and 
walked over to the third wound- 
ed man. 

“Hello Bill ...” a weak voice 
said. “I guess the old reflexes 
are slowing down ... I can’t 
blame you for shooting me, I 



should have hit the dirt like the 
others . .” 

“You’re damn right you should 
have,” Bill said looking down 
at the familiar, loathed, tusked 
face. “You’re dying Deathwish, 
you’ve bought it.” 

“I know,” Deathwish said and 
coughed. His eyes were closed. 

“Wrap this line in a circle,” 
Bill shouted. “I want the medic 
up here.” The chain of prisoners 
curved around and they watch- 
ed as the medic examined the 
casualties. 

“A bandage on the looie’s arm 
takes care of him,” he said. “Just 
superficial burns. But the big 
guy with the fangs has bought 
it.” 

“Can you keep him alive?” 
Bill asked. 

“For awhile, no telling how 
long.” 

“Keep him alive.” Bill looked 
around at the circle of prisoners. 
“Any way to get those neckirons 
off?” he asked. 

“Not without the keys,” a bur- 
ly infantry sergeant answered, 
“and the lizards never brought 
them. We’ll have to wear them 
until we get back. How come 
you risked your neck saving us?” 
he asked suspiciously. 

“Who wanted to save you?” 
Bill sneered. “I was hungry and 
I figured that must be food you 
were carrying.” 

“Yeah, it is,” the sergeant 

77 



THE STARSLOGGERS 



said, looking relieved. “I can 
understand now why you took 
the chance.” 

Bill broke open a can of ra- 
tions and stuffed his face. 

'"T''he dead man was cut from 
his position in the line and 
the two men, one in front and 
one in back of the wounded 
Deathwish, wanted to do the 
same with him. Bill reasoned 
with them, explained the only 
human thing to do was to carry 
their buddy, and they agreed 
with him when he threatened to 
bum their legs off if they didn’t. 
While the chained men were 
eating. Bill cut two flexible poles 
and made a stretcher by slipping 
three donated uniform jackets 
over them. He gave the captured 
rifles to the burly sergeant and 
the most likely looking combat 
veterans, keeping one for him- 
self. 

“Any chance of getting back?” 
Bill asked the sergeant, who was 
carefully wiping the moisture 
from his gun. 

“Maybe. We can backtrack 
the way we come, easy enough 
to follow the trail after every- 
one dragged through. Keep an 
eye peeled for Venians, get them 
before they can spread the word 
about us. When we get in ear- 
shot of the fighting we try and 
find a quiet area — then break 
through. A fifty-fifty chance.” 

78 



“Those are better odds for 
all of us than they were about 
an hour ago.” 

“You’re telling me. But they 
get worse the longer we hang 
around here.” 

“Let’s get moving.” 

Following the track was even 
easier than Bill had thought, 
and by early afternoon they 
heard the first signs of firing, a 
dim rumble in the distance. The 
only Venian they had seen had 
been instantly killed. Bill halt- 
ed the march. 

“Eat as much as you want, 
then dump the food,” he said. 
“Pass that on. We’ll be moving 
fast soon.” He went to see how 
Deathwish was getting on. 

“Badly — ” Deathwish gasped, 
his face white as paper. “This is 
it, Bill ... I know it . I’ve 
terrorized my last recruit . 
stood on my last pay line . 
had my last shortarm ... so 
long — Bill . you’re a good 
buddy . taking care of me like 
this . .” 

“Glad you think so, Death- 
wish, and maybe you’d like to 
do me a favor.” He dug in the 
dying man’s pockets until he 
found his noncom’s notebook, 
then opened it and scrawled on 
one of the blank pages. “How 
would you like to sign this, just 
for old time’s sake — Death- 
wish ?” 

The big jaw lay slack, the 

GALAXY 



evil red eyes open and staring. 

“The dirty bowb’s gone and 
died on me,” Bill said disgust- 
edly. After pondering for a mo- 
ment he dribbled some ink from 
the pen onto the ball of Death- 
wish’s thumb and pressed it to 
the paper to make a print. 

( yTedic!” he shouted, and 
the line of men curled 
around so the medic could come 
back. “How does he look to 
you?” 

“Dead as a herring,” the corps- 
man said after his professional 
examination. 

“Just before he died he left 
me his tusks in his will, written 
right down here, see? These are 
real vat- grown tusks and cost 
a lot. Can they be transplanted?” 

“Sure, as long as you get them 
cut out and deep froze inside 
the next twelve hours.” 

“No problem with that, we’ll 
just carry the body back with 
us.” He stared hard at the two 
stretcher bearers and fingered 
his gun r and they had no com- 
plaints. “Get that lieutenant up 
here.” 

“Chaplain,” Bill said, holding 
out the sheet from the note- 
book, “I would like an officer’s 
signature on this. Just before he 
died this trooper here dictated 
his will, but was too weak to 
sign it, so he put his thumbprint 
on it. Now you write below it 



that you saw him thumbprint it 
and it is all affirm and legal- 
like, then sign your name.” 

“But — I couldn’t do that my 
son. I did not see the deceased 
print the will and glmmpf . 

He said glmmpf because Bill 
had poked the barrel of the 
atomic pistol into his mouth and 
was rotating it, his finger quiv- 
ering on the trigger. 

“Shoot,” the infantry sergeant 
said, and three of the men who 
could see what was going on 
were clapping. Bill slowly with- 
drew the pistol. 

“I shall be happy to help,” 
the chaplain said, grabbing for 
the pen. 

Bill read the document, grunt- 
ed in satisfaction, then went 
over and squatted down next to 
the medic. “You from the hos- 
pital?” he asked. 

“You can say that again, and 
if I ever get back into the hos- 
pital I ain’t never going out of it 
again. It was just my luck to be 
out picking up combat casualties 
when the raid hit.” 

“I hear that they aren’t ship- 
ping any wounded out. Just put- 
ting them back into shape and 
sending them back into the line.” 

“You heard right. This is go- 
ing to be a hard war to live 
through.” 

“But some of them must be 
wounded too badly to send back 
into action,” Bill insisted.

tt'T'he miracles of modem 
medicine,” the medic said 
indistinctly as he worried a cake 
of dehydrated luncheon meat. 
“Either you die or you’re back 
in the line in a couple of weeks.” 
“Maybe a guy gets his arm 
blown off?” 

“They got an icebox full of 
old arms. Sew a new one on and 
bango, right back into the line.” 
“What about a foot?” Bill 
asked, worried. 

“That’s right — I forgot! They 
got a foot shortage. So many 
guys lying around without feet 
that they’re running out of bed- 
space. They were starting to 
ship some of them offplanet 
when I left.” 

“You got any pain pills?” Bill 
asked, changing the subject. The 
medic dug out a white bottle. 

“Three of these and you’d 
laugh while they sawed your 
head off.” 

“Give me three.” 

“If you ever see a guy around 
what has his foot shot off you 
better quick tie something 
around his leg just over the 
knee, tight, to cut the blood 
off.” 

“Thanks buddy.” 

■ “Let’s get moving,” the infan- 
try sergeant said. “The quicker 
we move the better our chances.” 
Occasional flares from atomic 
rifles burned through the foilage 
overhead and the thud-thud of 



heavy weapons shook the mud 
under their feet. They worked 
along parallel with the firing 
until it had died down, then 
stopped. Bill, the only one not 
chained in the line, crawled 
ahead to reeonnoiter. The ene- 
my lines seemed to be lightly 
held and he found the spot that 
looked the best for a break- 
through. Then, before he return- 
ed, he dug the heavy cord from 
his pocket that he had taken 
from one of the ration boxes. He 
tied a tourniquet above his right 
knee and twisted it tight with a 
stick, then swallowed the three 
pills. He stayed behind some 
heavy shrubs when he called to 
the others. 

“Straight ahead, then sharp 
right before that clump of trees. 
Let’s go — and FAST!” 

Bill led the way until the first 
men could see the lines ahead. 
Then he called out, “What’s 
that?” and ran into the heavy 
foilage. “Chingers!” he shouted 
and sat down with his back to 
a tree. 

He took careful aim with his 
pistol and blew his right foot 
off. 

“Get moving fast!” he shout- 
ed and heard the crash of the 
frightened men through the un- 
dergrowth. He threw the pistol 
away, fired at random into the 
trees a few times, then dragged 
to his feet. The atomic rifle 



80 



GALAXY 



made a good enough crutch to 
hobble along on and he did not 
have far to go. Two troopers, 
they must have been new to 
combat or they would have 
known better, left the shelter to 
help him inside. 

“Thanks, buddie,” he gasped, 
and sank to the ground. “War 
sure is hell.” 

XIII 

' ■ 'he martial music echoed from 
the hillside, bouncing back 
from the rocky ledges and losing 
itself in the hushed green shad- 
ows under the trees. Around the 
bend, stamping proudly through 
the dust, came the little parade 
led by the magnificent form of 
a one-robot-band. Sunlight 
gleamed on its golden limbs and 
twinkled from the brazen in- 
struments it worked with such 
enthusiasm. A small formation of 
assorted robots rolled and clat- 
tered in its wake and bringing 
up the rear was the solitary fi- 
gure of the grizzle-haired re- 
cruiting sergeant, striding along 
strongly, his rows of medals a- 
jingle. Though the road was 
smooth the sergeant lurched sud- 
denly, stumbling, and cursed 
with the rich proficiency of 
years. 

“Halt!” he commanded, and 
while his little company braked 
to a stop he leaned against the 



stone wall that bordered the road 
and rolled up his right pants 
leg. When he whistled one of the 
robots trundled quickly over and 
held out a tool box from which 
the sergeant took a large screw- 
driver and tightened one of the 
bolts in the ankle of his artifi- 
cial foot. Then he squirted a few 
drops from an oil can onto the 
joint and rolled the pants leg 
back down. When he straighten- 
ed up he noticed that a robo- 
mule was pulling a plow down 
a furrow in the field beyond the 
fence a farmlad guided it. 

“Beer!” the sergeant barked, 
then, “A Spacemen’s Lament .” 
“That’s sure pretty music,” 
the plowboy said. 

“Join me in a beer,” the ser- 
geant said, sprinkling a white 
powder into it. 

“Don’t mind iffen I do, sure is 

hottern’n H out here today.” 

“Say hell, son.” 

“Momma don’t like me to 
cuss. You sure do have long 
teeth, mister.” 

The sergeant twanged a tusk. 
“A big fellow like you shouldn’t 
worry about a little cussing. If 
you were a trooper you could 
say hell — or even bowb — if 
you wanted to, all the time.” * 
“I don’t think I’d want to say 
anything like that,” he flushed 
redly under his deep tan. 
“Thanks for the beer, but I 
gotta be ploughing on now.

Momma said I was to never talk 
to soldiers.” 

tt'VT'our momma’s right, a 
* dirty, cussing, drinking 
crew the most of them. Say, 
would you like to see a picture 
here of a new model robomule 
that can run 1,000 hours without 
lubrication?” The sergeant held 
his hand out behind him and a 
robot put a viewer into it. 

"Why that sounds nice!” The 
farmlad raised the viewer to his 
eyes and looked into it and 
flushed an even deeper red. 
"That’s no mule, mister, that’s a 
girl and her clothes are . .” 
The sergeant reached out 
swiftly and pressed a button on 
the top of the viewer. Some- 
thing went thunk inside of it 
and the farmer stood, rigid and 
frozen. He did not move or 
change expression when the ser- 
geant reached out and took the 
little machine. 

“Take this stylo,” the sergeant 
said, and the other’s fingers 
closed on it “Now sign this form, 
recruits’ signature.” 

"My Charlie! What are you 
doing with my Charlie!” an an- 
cient, gray-haired woman wailed 
as she scrambled toward them. 

“Your son is now a trooper 
for the greater glory of the Em- 
peror,” the sergeant said, and 
waved over the robot tailor. 
“No — please!” the woman 



begged, clutching the sergeant’s 
hand and dribbling tears onto 
it. “I’ve lost one son, isn’t that 
enough.” she blinked up through 
the tears, then blinked again. 
“But you — you’re my boy! My 
Bill come home! Even with those 
teeth and the scars and one 
black hand and one white hand 
and one artificial foot, I can 
tell, a mother always knows!” 
The sergeant frowned down at 
the woman. “I believe you might 
be right,” he said. “I thought 
Phigerinadon II was familiar.” 
The robot tailor had finished 
his job, the red paper jacket 
shone bravely in the sun, the 
one-molecule-thick boots gleam- 
ed. “Fall in,” Bill shouted. 

“Billy, Billy . .” the woman 
wailed, “this is your little broth- 
er Charlie! You wouldn’t take 
your own little brother into the 
troopers, would you?” 

Bill thought about his mother, 
then he thought about his baby 
brother, Charlie, then he thought 
of the one month that would be 
taken off of his enlistment time 
for every recruit he brought in, 
and he snapped his answer back. 
“Yes,” he said. 

The music blared, the soldiers 
marched, the mother cried — as 
mothers have always done — and 
the brave little band tramped 
down the road and over the hill 
and out of sight into the sunset.

THE RULES 
OF THE ROAD 

by NORMAN SPINRAD 



Anyone who dared might enter the 
maze from the stars , but no one 
would return alive — or humanl 



'T''he great silver dome sat in 
the desert at Yucca Flats. 
It was featureless, save for an in- 
nocent-appearing open entrance- 
way, but there was something 
about it that shrieked : alien. The 
silver shimmer was not quite the 
shimmer of silver. Rather it was 
more like the silver of shimmer. 

The tanks, machine-gun em- 
placements and foxholes sur- 
rounding the dome confirmed 
the sense of alienness. The dome 
was surrounded and cordoned 
off. Whether it was being guard- 



ed or contained was a moot ques- 
tion. 

Near the opening in the dome 
a tent had been pitched. The 
flag of a three-star general flew 
from a makeshift flagpole. In- 
side the tent were a half-dozen 
canvas folding chairs, an elabor- 
ate radio setup, a large map 
table that seemed to serve no 
useful function, five assorted 
colonels, Lieutenant General 
Richard Brewster — a middle- 
aged man with the look of an 
athlete gone to fat — and one 



83 



lone civilian, looking plucked 
and out of place amidst all that 
khaki plumage. 

General Brewster eyed the 
civilian with cold resignation. 

“I’ve lost ten men in there al- 
ready,” he said, in a tone of voice 
like a poker player describing a 
particularly bad run of cards. 

“Ten men, and we don’t know 
any more than when we started.” 
Brewster stared out the open 
tent flap at the entrance to the 
dome. “Only one thing we 
know,” he said. “It’s from the 
stars.” 

“Interesting,” said the civilian 
flatly. He was a wiry man, not 
short, not tall. His face showed 
even more tension than his spare 
body. His mouth seemed frozen 
in a perpetual sour sneer, his 
expression appeared dead and 
juiceless. Only his large dark 
eyes betrayed him. They shifted 
purposefully from focus to foc- 
us, absorbing, categorizing, an- 
alyzing. 

“Interesting? Is that all you 
have to say, Lindstrom? Inter- 
esting? It’s from the stars, man. 
We tracked it from beyond the 
orbit of Pluto. Don’t you under- 
stand? It’s a spaceship from an- 
other solar system. It’s the key 
to the stars.” 

“That’s what it is to you,” said 
Lindstrom. “But what is it to 
whatever sent it here? Are you 
so sure they intend it as a key 



to the stars? What about those 
ten men you sent in who never 
came out? Do you think they’re 
so sure it’s the key to the stars?” 
“What are you leading up to, 
man?” spat Brewster, with un- 
concealed distaste. 

“Just that you know nothing 
about why that thing came here. 
Ten men go in, and none of them 
come out. Maybe it’s not here to 
give us the stars at all. Maybe 
it’s purpose is as alien as its 
manufacture. Or maybe — ” Lind- 
strom paused and allowed him- 
self a grin. 

“Maybe it’s just a better 
mousetrap,” he said. 

“Well,” said Brewster, “will 
you cr won’t you? If you’re try- 
ing to point out how dangerous 
it is, you’re wasting your time. 
I’ve lost ten men as it is. I know 
damn well it’s dangerous. I’ve 
been told you’re not afraid of 
danger. I’ve been told you enjoy 
it.” 

Lindstrom laughed brittly. “In 
a way,” he said. “It’s not that I 
enjoy danger, General. It’s just 
that I need it. The question is, 
how much do you think you need 
me?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I mean two hundred and 
fifty thousand tax-free dollars. 
Take it or leave it.” 

“Payable if you succeed in tell- 
ing us what’s inside the dome?” 
“What else?” 



84 



GALAXY 



Brewster nodded. “Okay, 
you’re on.” 

T)ert Lindstrom was aware of 
his glamor only when he 
wanted a woman. Then it prov- 
ed most useful; it was a well- 
honed, finely-crafted tool. There 
were plenty of women who could 
resist the soldier of fortune myth, 
to be sure, but there were many 
more who could not. The prob- 
abilities were all on his side. 

And odds were Bert Lind- 
strom’s religion. 

Lindstrom was a calculating 
man. He would undertake noth- 
ing that did not seem to offer 
an odds on chance of success. 
Nothing, from seduction to as- 
sassination. 

Yet he would never fail to ac- 
cept a challenge when the odds 
were in his favor — no matter if 
he were risking m dime or his 
life. 

For in his system of values, 
there was no real difference. It 
was not what was being risked 
that counted, it was the risk it- 
self. His life meant little to him 
when he was not risking it. Only 
when he was gambling with his 
existence did it come to have 
meaning — then it was the stake, 
the challenge, the risk. 

Lindstrom did not seek death. 
He risked his life only when he 
felt that the odds were on his 
side. He did not seek death, but 



he had to be near it, he had to 
risk it, for only at the moment of 
risk could his life have any 
meaning. 

And this was the best risk in 
a life of risks. Not necessarily 
because it was the longest shot 
of all. Lindstrom had the profes- 
sional risk-taker’s contempt for 
soldiers who took risks on or- 
ders. 

That ten soldiers had not come 
out was a thing of little im- 
port. 

What was interesting was that 
the dome from the stars was a 
total unknown. Even the odds on 
coming out were incalculable. 
They might be in his favor, they 
might not. He was betting his in- 
stinctive feelings about himself 
against a complete unknown. 

If he had set up the situation 
himself in a laboratory he could 
not have contrived a more per- 
fect risk. 

nphe hot desert wind blew at 
Lindstrom’s back as he ap- 
proached the entrance to the 
dome. 

The soldiers who had not come 
out had been armed to the teeth. 
Therefore Lindstrom was not. 

He carried only his old .45, a 
machete which was more a luck- 
charm than anything else, a coil 
of rope, an all-purpose utility 
knife and a flashlight. 

The entrance was little more 

85 



THE RULES OF THE ROAD 



than a door-sized hole in the ma- 
terial of the dome. Lindstrom 
peered inside. He could see noth- 
ing but blackness. He drew his 
gun, turned on the flashlight and 
stepped inside. 

As soon as he crossed the 
threshhold, there was light. It 
did not seem to come from any- 
where, it just was. 

In the pearly luminescence, he 
could see he was standing at the 
mouth of a tunnel, a smooth, 
round, somehow almost color- 
less tunnel, that curved crazily 
upwards and leftwards in an arc 
so steep that it seemed impos- 
sible to hold one’s footing. 

Nevertheless, Lindstrom de- 
cided to try to climb it. Although 
the material of the tunnel seem- 
ed glass-smooth, it did not have 
a low frictional coefficient. It 
was more like walking on con- 
crete than glass. 

Stranger still, although his 
eyes told him that he was walk- 
ing up a curve at an impossible 
angle, his body . tilted almost 
forty degrees from the vertical, 
his kinesthetic senses told a dif- 
ferent story. The force of gravity 
remained perpendicular to the 
floor of the tunnel, no matter 
what angle the tunnel took to 
the Earth’s surface, so that he 
was walking upright, as if the 
tunnel had a private gravity all 
its own. 

Lindstrom was somewhat 



frightened: the instinctual fear 
of the unknown. This he had, of 
course, expected. Fear meant 
that there was danger, risk. And 
risk meant that he was living. 

The tunnel came to a fork. 
Decision number one. Had this 
been the point at which the sol- 
diers had made the wrong cal- 
culation? Lindstrom was sure 
that surviving in the dome was 
a matter of making the proper 
calculations, the correct deci- 
sions. Either that, or there was 
no way of surviving. And that 
was a possibility not worth con- 
sidering — since if it were true, 
the game was already lost. 

It was like walking on a ledge 
over a precipice in the dark. You 
knew that there was a safe path 
and you knew that there was a 
point beyond which death lurk- 
ed. But you had no way of 
knowing how Wide the ledge was, 
how much margin for error you 
had. 

There was nothing to choose 
between the two forks. The one 
on the right curved up, the one 
on the left down. Otherwise they 
were identical. A random choice. 

Okay, thought Lindstrom. He 
hesitated for only a moment, and 
then, for no reason in particular, 
took the right-hand turn. 

He had only gone a few steps, 
the intersection was just behind 
him, when he felt a sudden flash 
of heat at his back. 



86 



GALAXY 



He whirled in time to see a 
solid pillar of fire engulf the 
crotch of the intersection, the 
spot where he had stood mo- 
ments ago pondering his choice. 

T esson number one, he thought. 

' No Hamlets allowed. When 
faced with a decision, make it, 
one way or the other. Don’t tem- 
porize, or you’ll be vaporized. 

The tunnel wound on for an 
indeterminable distance. Then it 
ended. Or, from another point of 
view, took an abrupt ninety-de- 
gree turn and became a bottom- 
less, black, circular hole. 

Lindstrom shined his light into 
the hole. The beam petered out 
in the blackness. The hole seem- 
ed made of the same material as 
the tunnel. There was nothing to 
secure the rope to. 

Now what? thought Lindstrom 
grimly. And how much time do 
I have? He remembered the pil- 
lar of fire at the fork. 

He felt that weird, timeless, 
floating exhilaration that he only 
experienced at those times when 
he knew that death was near, 
and had the time to contemplate 
it. 

The hole was like the tun- 
nel. He must go forward, or . 

Not like the tunnel. It was the 
tunnel. Or at least it should be. 

Fatalistically he dangled his 
feet into the hole, until his soles 
contacted its sides. Then he 



“stood up” — or rather stood 
down. 

Quite suddenly, he was stand- 
ing upright in what had been the 
hole. Now it was just more of 
the same tunnel. The thing ac- 
tually did have a gravity of its 
own. 

Lesson number two, he thought. 
This place has its own rules. 
Learn them and obey them. 

It was highly probable that 
none of the soldiers had gotten 
this far. This was a place that 
demanded a cold mathematical 
intimacy with death. It was a 
place where the greatest risk of 
all was not to take risks. 

It was no place for a man un- 
der orders. 

Lindstrom felt calmer now; he 
had dared and he had won. The 
fear that he had left was not a 
paralyzer, it was a tonic, the 
satisfied fear that a matador 
feels when he realizes that he 
is facing a truly great bull. 

He wandered further along the 
tunnel, and with every passing 
minute, the calmness he felt he 
had earned diminished. 

This was not ordinary mortal 
danger — Lindstrom had lived 
on speaking terms with death 
too long for mere danger to be 
extraordinary. It was something 
far worse. He was thinking too 
much as he walked, and this was 
a place that was not to be 
thought about, because it was a 



THE RULES OF THE ROAD 



87 



place without rules . which is 
one symptom of madness . 

There might be no rules, he 
thought, but there must be a 
purpose. Something had brought 
the dome to Earth, something 
intelligent, and intelligence im- 
plies purpose. 

But what if it really were just 
a giant mousetrap? 

But that was ridiculous. If 
they had wanted merely to kill 
him, they could have done it 
long ago. The dome was not only 
their creation, it was a universe 
in itself. Inside the dome, they 
could alter the very rules of ex- 
istence. No, the rules were set 
up so that it was possible to sur- 
vive. Fantastically difficult, but 
possible. 

That was all he had to cling 
to. The odds against survival 
might be astronomical, but sur- 
vival was at least a possibility. 

I can die, he thought. There- 
fore I can live. 

In the distance, around a bend, 
the tunnel ended. It opened in- 
to a large domed chamber. The 
chamber was lit with the same 
pearly light as the tunnel, and 
it seemed to be made of the same 
substance. 

It was a smooth, featureless 
room. A dead end. It was empty. 

A voice that was not a voice 
nibbled at his mind. 

“You have passed the entrance 



examination,” it “said”. “Are you 
ready?” 

“Ready for what?” 

“Ready." 

The single word had many 
nuances. It seemed to Lindstrom 
that the voice in his mind was 
intimate with his entire being. 
Ready . Ready was the word 
that described his entire life. 
Ready seemed to imply accept- 
ance and belligerance at the same 
time. Ready to accept possible 
death, and ready to fight to 
cling to life. Ready to wait, and 
ready to make instant decisions. 
“Yes,” said the voice, “yes.” 
“Why?” asked Lindstrom. 
“Why all this? Why . .” 
“Your General Brewster was 
right,” said the voice. “In a way, 
this is a spaceship. A starship. 
For your people, it can be the 
key to the universe. If you are 
ready. If you can change.” 
“Change to what?” said Lind- 
strom. 

“Change," said the voice. “Not 
change to what. Adapt to that 
which is constantly changing. 
Live on a tightrope strung over 
nothingness. Your race is now 
reaching for the planets of your 
solar system. A tiny beginning. 
You have conquered your world 
by adapting it to your needs. But 
the universe will not be adapted. 
An infinity of deaths awaits you 
out there. Death you cannot now 
even conceive of.” 



88 



GALAXY 



“Fve never been afraid of 
death,” snapped Lindstrom. 

“You have always been afraid 
of death,” said the voice. “It 
is your very fear which allows 
you to face it. But fear is not 
enough.” 

“What else is there?” 

“You will learn. Here you will 
learn, or you will die.” 

“Why? Why?” 

“Perhaps you are ready to be- 
gin to learn why,” said the voice. 
“Behold the road to the stars.” 

He was in a place that was ter- 
ror. It was no place at all. It was 
everyplace. He was at the same 
time in a lightless blackness, and 
the mad dissociated core of a 
sun. It was a space with no di- 
mensions. It was a space with 
an infinity of dimensions. 

He had no senses. He had 
senses that could not exist. He 
tasted color. He saw time ravel- 
ed like a vast ball of twine about 
him. He heard the creation of 
the universe, and he smelt the 
acrid stench of its eventual 
death. 

Entropy ran forward, back- 
ward, in circles. He was bigger 
than the entire universe; it nest- 
led in his navel. He stood on the 
non-existent surfaces of a tril- 
lion electrons. 

He was an insect, a star, a 
void, a galaxy. 

He screamed and screamed 
and screamed and screamed . 



He burned and froze, exploded 
and imploded, his mind was boil- 
ed in alien thoughts unspeakably 
foul. He rolled in beauty so hid- 
eous that he died an infinity of 
deaths from pleasure . 

“Stop. Stop. Stop!” His cries 
echoed from the walls of exist- 
ence and rebounded back to 
sting his flesh like a geometrical- 
ly breeding nest of angry hor- 
nets . 

“Enough,” said the voice. 

T T e was back in the featureless 
chamber. 

“W-what . what was it?” 

“That,” said the voice, “is the 
real universe. All else, is illu- 
sion, a partial truth, the projec- 
tion in three dimensions of a 
reality with an infinity of dimen- 
sions. That is the road to the 
stars.” 

“You mean we have to learn to 
navigate in that? To remain sane 
long enough to find our way? It’s 
impossible!” 

“No,” said the voice. “That is 
the real universe. It is not 
enough to learn to travel through 
it. You must learn to live in it.” 

“In it?” exclaimed Lindstrom. 
“In that madness?” 

“It is reality,” said the voice. 
“The universe is not as tidy as 
you would like it to be. Time is 
not really a straight line, nor 
space three-dimensional. It is

It is possible to be all times at 
once. Your race’s view of the 
universe is pathetically limited. 
Limited, perhaps to preserve 
your sanity.” 

Lindstrom felt his mind perch- 
ed on the edge of a fathomless 
abyss. He felt the bonds of real- 
ity crumbling about him. What, 
after all, was reality? Was it real- 
ly this unspeakable horror, this 
mad, murderous confusion . .? 

“Yes,” said the voice, “you are 
looking down into an abyss. But 
you must do more, you must 
learn to jump willingly into it. 
In the real universe, laws of na- 
ture are not constant. The rules 
themselves vary, according to 
rules for rules, which in turn 
vary according to still higher or- 
ders or rules . .” 

“Stop. Stop. No one can cope 
with a thing like that. I don’t 
want to know any more. I — ” 

“The choice is not yours,” said 
the voice. “No human will be 
permitted to leave this place un- 
changed. This chamber is a dead 
end. There is no other passage 
out but the way you came, and 
that tunnel is sealed to you for- 
ever.” 

“You mean you intend to keep 
me a prisoner here for the rest of 
my life?” 

“No,” said the voicd. “There 
is no passage out, but there is a 
way out. Either you will learn 
it, or you will die. We begin.” 



TTe was in a space with four 
dimensions. It hurt his mind. 
There was a fourth dimension 
that was somehow at right angle 
to all three normal directions . 

His body was . different. He 
was enclosed in a cubical box of 
some dull metal. Enclosed on all 
six sides. Slowly the walls of the 
box began to contract in on him 

He was trapped. He was sur- 
rounded on all six sides. 

But in this space, a cube did 
not have six sides, it had thirty- 
six. 

He did a thing that strained 
his mind near breaking. He mov- 
ed at right angles to all six faces 
of the contracting cube, simul- 
taneously. 

He was out. 

And he was a point in a space 
with no dimensions. He was ev- 
ery point in the space, since all 
points coincided. 

He was trapped in a space with 
no dimensions. There could be 
no motion . 

But time existed, and in this 
place time had three dimensions. 
The special point that was Lind- 
strom wriggled in three temporal 
dimensions, and became a tem- 
poral solid, and thus . 

He was back in “normal” 
space-time. 

And was whisked into a star- 
filled blackness . But the blaz- 
ing suns were also the nuclei of 



90 



GALAXY 



the atoms of his body, corres- 
ponding, one for one, with each 
other, macrocosm and micro- 
cosm. 

He did a thing with his mind 
for which there are no words, and 
he was back once more in the 
featureless chamber . 

And was transported to even 
stranger othernesses . An in- 
finity of places, dimensions and 
othernesses for which there are 
not even the ghosts of concepts. 

He felt a strangeness in his 
mind, a complexity beyond com- 
plexity, a revelation of new and 
unexpected textures in his psy- 
che. Time was flux, space was 
flux, eternity was a variable. 

There came a time when he 
stood, naked, alone and home- 
sick, on the surface of some far- 
off planet, looking up at a small 
star he knew was Sol. He re- 
membered the spaces he had 
seen — spaces of no dimensions, 
an infinity of dimensions, spaces 
that were not spaces, but times. 

There was a way back to Earth. 

He did something with his 
mind, and the surface of the 
planet vanished like mist. His 
body floated in total blackness. 
He felt it expand and contract 
rhythmically, from the size of an 
electron to the size of the uni- 
verse . He caught it in a phase 
where each of its atoms corre- 
sponded to a star in the Galaxy. 

Then he let his entire mass 



slide down the hill of space-time 
into one of the sun-atoms, the 
one called “Sol”, to one of its 
electrons called “Earth.” 

He was back in the chamber. 
And he knew the way out. 

eneral Brewster stood out- 
side his tent, staring at the 
silver dome, and wondering 
whether it was time to try some- 
thing else. 

“Lindstrom’s been in there two 
days,” he said to a nervous-look- 
ing colonel. “I think we can as- 
sume that whatever happened to 
the others happened to him.” 
“What now, sir?” 

“I don’t know ... I just don’t 
know. I suppose we could try 
to blow the thing open, but — ” 
A man suddenly appeared out 
of nowhere. He was standing just 
outside the dome. He was a wiry 
man, not short, not tall .... 
“What — it’s Lindstrom.” 

The being that had been Bert 
Lindstrom began to walk slowly 
toward the tent. It had two arms, 
two legs, two eyes, a nose, a 
mouth. It was, in fact, the per- 
fect image of the man who had 
entered the dome. 

But when Lindstrom was close 
enough for Brewster to see into 
his eyes, the general was dread- 
fully sure that the creature fac- 
ing him was something other 
than human.

BY WILLY LEY 

THE 

RAREST ANIMALS 

F or the last sixty years zoo- 
logists and many other peo- 
ple who love wildlife have been 
worrying about a problem that 
does not even occur to a real 
estate dealer or the manager of 
the Friendly Neighborhood 
Household Finance office. It is 
the fact that our earth is growing 
poorer by a species of animal life 
every decade or so. And during 



94 



the last twenty years this worry 
has taken a sharp turn upward 
for two reasons : the general pop- 
ulation explosion and the fact 
that there are many new and 
recently independent nations in 
South East Asia and in Africa. 
I am, on principle, quite pleased 
about the fact that these nations 
are now independent I am even 
willing to admit that practically 
all of their governments know 
how sad it would be if the wild- 
life of their areas disappeared. 
Unfortunately they don’t do 
much about it 

British and German scientists 
who flew to Africa for private 
inspections have stated with both 
anger and concern that things are 
not as pretty by far as the gov- 
ernment handouts would have it. 
Sure, there are wildlife preserves. 
Often they actually have boun- 
dary markers. But most of them 
are not policed and poachers, 
even if caught, are never prose- 
cuted. Trying to convince the 
people concerned sounds like a 
hopeless task; they simply do not 
understand the need for con- 
servation. When told that with- 
out conservation the zebras and 
gnus and antelopes will be gone 
one day, they answer that cattle 
taste better. 

Fortunately the larger forms 
of the African fauna are still 
numerous enough so that they 
can be saved. We have seen in 



the past what can be done even 
at a late hour — the American 
bison is an impressive example 
of this. 

At the time the thirteen colo- 
nies declared their idependence 
there were an estimated sixty 
million bison on the North Amer- 
ican continent. After the rail- 
roads had been built across the 
continent — and in spite of a few 
protective laws passed by states 
like Kansas and Colorado — the 
bison were virtually hunted out 
of existence. William, T. Homa- 
day of the New York Zoological 
Park wrote the Smithsonian Re- 
port for 1887 and entitled it “The 
Extermination of the American 
Bison”, predicting that the spe- 
cies would be extinct within less 
than two decades. Since a cen- 
sus taken by Hornaday in 1889 
showed that there were only 1091 
bison still living (two-thirds of 
them in Canada) his prediction 
would probably have come true 
if nothing had been done. 

But Hornaday, in 1905, found- 
ed the American Bison Society 
which gained the support of 
Theodore Roosevelt. Bison sanc- 
tuaries were founded, stocked 
and protected and forty-five 
years later the number of bison 
had grown to more than 40,000. 
It is even necessary now to 
slaughter surplus animals from 
time to time to keep the herds 
from deteriorating.

Fig. 1. The "Tasmanian Wolf". 
Does If Still Exist? 



\ nother pleasing example is 
the story of a large and un- 
gainly deer called Milu or Pere 
David’s Deer, for its "discoverer” 
was the French missionary Pere 
Armand David who went to Chi- 
na in 1862. I put the word “dis- 
coverer” in quotation marks be- 
cause Father David did not dis- 
cover the deer in the usual man- 
ner, that is in the open, as he 
did the Giant Panda. The deer 
existed only in one place, the 
emperor’s private hunting park. 
Father David, by climbing the 
wall, verified the existence of a 
species of deer unknown to 
science and then arranged for a 
few specimen ts to be shipped to 
the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. 

After the wall of bureaucratic 
secrecy had been breached the 
embassies of other countries be- 
came active. The Zoological Gar- 
den in Berlin obtained a speci- 
men via a diplomatic exchange 
of some kind and the Duke of 
Bedford bought several. This 
purchase saved the Milu. 



In 1895 there was a flood of 
the Hun Ho river that toppled 
the wall of the Imperial Park 
in several places. The starving 
peasants, made homeless by the 
same flood, killed and ate every 
animal in sight, including all the 
Milus. The speciments in the 
various zoological parks died of 
old age one by one and only the 
small herd at IjVobum Abbey on 
the estates of Duke of Bedford 
increased. In spite of a setback 
during the first World War the 
herd did well. Now there are 
close to three hundred Milus in 
existence, at Woburn and in 
many zoological gardens. 

There are a few more examples 
of this kind. Some thirty years 
ago the koalas of Queensland 
were believed to be near extinc- 
tion. They are numerous again 
now, due to strict measures. And 
in Europe the efforts of a society 
patterned after the American Bi- 
son Society seem to be successful 
in saving the European cousin of 
the bison, the wisent. There were 
only about fifty animals left at 
the end of the second World 
War. By now the number is more 
than, a hundred. ‘ 

These examples have proved 
that even a late action can be 
quite successful. The societies 
which are now concerned with 
the survival of the Whooping 
Crane and the California Condor 
can take heart. But for a few 



96 



GALAXY 



other species the day of extinc- 
tion is near. 

Zoologists have drawn up a 
list of about fifteen species which 
are very much endangered by 
two facts: the number of speci- 
mens is very small, and their 
geographical range is also very 
small. Their extinction could be 
the result of a single large forest 
fire, an unusually severe winter 
or the inability to escape newly 
introduced predators. 

This list has been referred to 
as “tomorrow’s fossils”. While it 
contains a few names where this 
term seems to be exaggerated — 
for example the wisent, which is 
under the firm protection of its 
own watchdog society — it also 
contains two names of species 
which may no longer exist. If 
survivors of these species are still 
in existence somewhere they are 
the rarest animals on earth. 

T heir scientific names are Thy- 
lacinus cynocephalus and 
Solenodon cubanus, inhabitants, 
or former inhabitants, of Tas- 
mania and of Cuba respectively. 

Thylacinus was named by the 
English zoologist Harris who dis- 
played a fine knowledge of class- 
ical Greek in the process. The 
generic name Thylacinus was de- 
rived from the word thylax 
meaning “pouch” and kiifeter 
which means “disturber”: While 
the specific name cynocephalus 



comes from kyon (“dog”) and 
kephale (“head”). The English 
version of the scientific name 
would therefore be: the dog- 
headed pouched disturber (of 
livestock). The actual English 
name is Tasmanian Wolf because 
of the wolf-like head, or some- 
times Tasmanian Tiger, because 
of the tiger-striped hindquarters. 
In size a fully grown male could 
compete with a police dog. The 
females were much smaller. The 
Tasmanian Wolf, therefore, was 
the largest meat-eating marsu- 
pial. 

As long as the number of set- 
tlers was small and the number 
of “wolves” was large it was very 
decidedly a nuisance. It is not 
surprising that the settlers shot 
them whenever they saw one. 
But while wolf-like in appear- 
ance, the habits of Thylacinus 
were quite different. It seems to 
have hunted alone and was not 
particularly swift. Instead of 
overtaking its prey the Tasman- 
ian Wolf wore it out by relent- 
less pursuit. Then, when the prey 
finally collapsed, Thylacinus just 
ate as much as it wanted, leav- 
ing the remains to the other pre- 
datory marsupial of Tasmania, 
the smaller Tasmanian Devil. 
One zoologist, about eighty years 
ago, claimed that small groups 
of Tasmanian Devils trailed a 
hunting Tasmanian Wolf, know- 
ing from experience that a free

meal would be forthcoming soon- 
er or later. The Tasmanian Devil 
is now rare, too, but does seem 
to be on the verge of extinction. 
It may be saved because it 
makes a friendly pet when cap- 
tured young enough to be train- 
ed. 

The last thirty years of the 
history of the Tasmanian Wolf 
consist mainly of rumors. It is 
definite that a settler shot one 
in 1930. At that time another 
specimen was alive in the zoo- 
logical park at Hobart, Tasma- 
nia’s largest city. When the zoo 
speciment died in 1935 the offi- 
cials issued a call for a replace- 
ment, apparently confident that 
they would get one soon. They 
never did. But in 1938 one was 
shot and photographed at Maw- 
banna on Tasmania’s northwest 
coast. In 1957, a pilot, flying a 
helicopter along the island’s west 
coast, saw a striped animal from 
the air which could have been 
a Tasmanian Wolf. But a search 
on the ground which was started 



almost immediately did not find 
it. 

'T'he latest case dates from the 
year 1961. A fisherman night- 
fishing for bait at Sandy Cape 
(also in the northwest of the 
island) ran into an animal in the 
dark, and in the ensuing fight 
bashed its skull in. In the morn- 
ing he realized that he had prob- 
ably killed a “tiger”, as he called 
it. He must have done some soul- 
searching in the light of the early 
morning. He knew of a fine of 
a £100 for killing a Thylacinus; 
on the other hand he knew that 
any reliable report on this ani- 
mal was of scientific value. So he 
took hair and blood samples and 
sent them to the university where 
they were tentatively identified 
as having come from a “tiger”. 
Presumably the samples were 
too small to make the identifica- 
tion positive. 

And that’s the story now. 

Nobody can say that the Tas- 
manian Wolf is extinct, and no-

Probably exterminated by mongooses. 

body can insist that it is still 
alive. If it is, it is one of the 
rarest animals on earth. 

A 11 this applies to the Cuban 
solenodon too, with the com- 
plication that it is much harder 
to get any information at all. 
But before I go into the short 
and flimsy story of the Cuban 
solenodon a little backtracking 
is necessary. 

In 1833 the Russian Academy 
in St. Petersburg received a spe- 
cimen of a new animal from 
Haiti. It looked somewhat like a 
shrew but was the size of a very 
large rat. It was turned over to 
the Curator of Mammals, a Ger- 
man named Brandt, who describ- 
ed it and who also had to invent 
a scientific name. Since it was 
generally a puzzling animal he 
called it Solenodon paradoxus. 
(Solenodon means “grooved 
teeth”.) Naturally American 
scientists were interested, but in- 
quiries made near the latter part 



of the nineteenth century brought 
the reply that no such animal 
was known. If there had been 
one like it, it was extinct. 

One of the men who received 
such a reply was Prof. Addison 
Emery Verrill of Yale Univer- 
sity; and his son, Alpheus Hyatt 
Verrill, who explored the West 
Indies early in this century, suc- 
ceeded in re-discovering Solen- 
odon paradoxus in Santo Domin- 
go in 1907. He obtained a female 
which, on the day after capture, 
gave birth to three naked young 
and died immediately afterward. 
The animal must have been very 
rare. It is now extinct. 

The Cuban solenodon was dis- 
covered in 1861 when a German 
traveler by the name of Gund- 
lach shot one and sent it to the 
Natural History Museum in Ber- 
lin for identification. It was 
found to be a close relative of the 
species described by Brandt and 
though it lived on Hispaniola as 
well as on Cuba the scientific 
name became Solenodon cuban- 
us. 

In shape it looked very much 
like a shrew. Its color was a typ- 
ical camouflage color of the forest 
floor, a yellowish brown which 
was overlaid on the back by 
fairly long blackish guide hairs. 
The tail was naked. The overall 
length was about 20 inches with 
the tail accounting for about 7 
inches of the total length.

Several zoologists went to 
Cuba for the main purpose of 
studying solenodon. They found 
that it was nocturnal and fond of 
going into shallow water. It 
would eat anything, provided it 
was meat; when hunting on its 
own it ate beetles, grubs and 
worms but was quite willing to 
kill young chickens, which it tore 
apart with the long claws of its 
front feet. It had two cries. One 
of them was likened to the grunt- 
ing of a piglet, while the other 
was shrill, like that of a carniv- 
orous bird. Every once in a while 
— reasons unknown — it would se- 
crete an oily reddish liquid with 
an unpleasant smell. 

T) y about 1910 zoologists knew 
that the nearest living rela- 
tives of the two solenodons were 
the Giant Water Shrew ( Potam - 
ogale velox ) of Africa and the 
hedgehog-like Tenrec of Mad- 
agascar. This was not as surpris- 
ing as it may look at first glance. 
Solenodon and its relatives be- 
longed to a group of ancient 
mammals which go under the 
general designation of insecti- 
vores. The name is misleading in 
that they do not live on insects 
only-; the African Potamogale is 
on a diet of fish and freshwater 
crabs, as are some of the smaller 
shrews that also are classed with 
the insectivores. In any event 
this is an ancient group of world- 



wide distribution. It is therefore 
not too much out of the ordinary 
that fairly close relatives should 
exist in widely separated parts 
of the globe. 

Since almost all of the insecti- 
vores are of nocturnal habits and 
most of them are small they are 
overlooked by the average per- 
son, even one living in the coun- 
try. 

Even though the Cuban solen- 
odon might have stolen a young 
chicken here and there it had 
never been actively pursued by 
the Cuban peasants- They had a 
much bigger worry. Rats had 
come ashore from ships and had 
multiplied prodigiously. Getting 
rid of rats, was, for a time, the 
main problem. Officials of the 
various island republics asked 
for expert advice: was there an 
animal which liked to hunt and 
to kill rats, preferably an animal 
that did not bother people? The 
experts said that there was just 
such an animal which also likes 
to hunt snakes, the Burmese 
mongoose. Beginning around 1870 
mongooses were imported to Ja- 
maica, to Cuba, to Hispaniola 
and everywhere else where rats 
caused damage. 

At first it looked like a huge 
success. Within three years the 
loss because of rat-spoiled sugar 
cane was halved on Jamaica. 
Cuba had similar results. Every- 
body was pleased that the mon- 



100 



GALAXY 



gooses liked the climate and mul- 
tiplied rapidly. But every mon- 
goose wanted to eat and the rats 
had become comparatively rare 
by the time the mongooses were 
numerous. So they attacked and 
ate snakes, and lizards and other 
wildlife — including solerodon. 

Officials of the U. S. Wildlife 
Commission watched, and saw 
to it that a law was passed pro- 
hibiting the import of live mon- 
gooses into the U.S.A. The South 
American countries followed suit 
and the Central American coun- 
tries did the same. Even the var- 
ious island governments passed 
such laws — a futile gesture be- 
cause they already had the 
“beneficial” mongoose on their 
islands in large numbers- 

The mongoose is the reason 
why Solenodon cubanus is likely 
to be extinct by now. 

I f I fail to sound positive one 
way or another it is by no 
means accidental, for amazing re- 
discoveries have taken place. In 
spite of the fact that more than 
fifty species have become extinct 
during the last one and a half 
centuries, zoological literature is 
full of notes and reports saying 
that such and such an animal, 
believed extinct, has been four, 
again. 

When I was a boy of about 
ten, there was a glass-covered 
case in the Natural History Mu- 



seum in Berlin, showing a dis- 
play of a number of fairly large 
pale-colored and beautiful but- 
terflies. A black-bordered card 
stated that this butterfly — its 
name is Apollo — was unfortu- 
nately extinct. When I was about 
twenty-five, the display case was 
still there but the card had been 
removed; in the meantime Apol- 
lo had been found alive and in 
large numbers in an area only 
about 100 miles to the east of the 
area in which it had been exter- 
minated by a series of severe 
winters. 

In Australia they had a card 
marked with a skull — meaning 
extinct — in the Melbourne mu- 
seum on a case displaying Lead- 
beater’s Opossum ( Gymnobelid - 
eus leadbeateri ) with the addi- 
tional information that only five 
specimens of it had ever been 
found. In 1961 the card had to 
be re-written, for a specimen of 
Leadbeater’s Opossum, quite 
alive and in good health, was 
caught in the mountains only 70 
miles from Melbourne. 

In New Zealand they were 
even sadder about an extinct 
large and flightless brightly col- 
ored bird which went under the 
native name of Takahe as well 
as under the scientific name of 
Notornis. Once it had ranged 
over both islands, and after it 
had become extinct on the North 
Island it had been captured re- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



101 



peatedly on the South Island, 
the last one in August 1898. Only 
four specimens had been cap- 
tured. The skins of three of 
them were in museums in Eu- 
rope; New Zealand held on to 
the last one. Of course the cards 
on the cases were either black- 
bordered or bore skulls, depend- 
ing on local scientific custom. 
By 1945 it was evident that 
the Takahe was extinct, since re- 
peated searches had failed to find 
one. But in 1948 a live Takahe 
was seen by an expedition look- 
ing for it because of footprints 
that had been found. One of the 
members of the expedition threw 
a net — capturing two Takahes. 
It is now known that there are 
two colonies of the birds in two 
adjacent areas to the west of 
Lake Te Anau. 

Of course the Takahe is a 
very rare bird, just as Lead- 
beater’s Opossum is a rare mar- 
supial- But they are not extinct. 

The story of the Cahow bird of 
Bermuda is quite similar. It was 
thought to be extinct and oc- 
casional reports were put down 
as confusions with a similar look- 
ing bird that goes under the 
name of Audubon’s Lesser Shear- 
water. Most of the reports prob- 
ably were confusions, but some 
may have been correct, because 
in January 1951 (after a dead 
bird which had killed itself fly- 
ing into a ''lighthouse had been 




fig. 4. Steller's Sea Cow 
Only three drawings of the animal 
exist, of which this one is the best. It 
was originally drawn by Sven Plenis- 
ner, a member of Bering's expedition- 

identified as a Cahow) it was 
discovered alive. Again : it is very 
rare, but it isn’t extinct. 

\ nd there is now good reason 
to believe that we have one 
more case of an animal believed 
to be extinct but actually still 
existing in very small numbers. 
The case has been reported in 
the August 1963 issue of the 
Russian journal Priroda (“Na- 
ture”), the official journal of the 
Academy of Science of the 
USSR. In July 1962 the captain 
and the crew of the Russian 
whaling ship Buran saw a group 
of large marine mammals in 
shallow water off Cape Navarin 
to the northeast of Kamtchatka. 
The bottom of this area is cov- 
ered by a dense growth of all 
kinds of marine plants. The six 
animals were not whales and 
they were not seals. Their length 
was between 20 and 24 feet, the 
skin was dark in color and they 
had a pendulous upper lip hang- 
ing across the front end of the 
lower jaw. Every once in a while

they dived, possibly browsing on 
the vegetation. 

Considering the place where 
these marine mammals were 
seen and the description of their 
appearance they could only be 
surviving specimens of Steller’s 
Sea Cow, known to zoologists as 
Rhytina stelleri. The animal was 
originally discovered during the 
winter from 1741 to 1742 when 
the survivors of Vitus Bering’s 
expedition to Alaska were ship- 
wrecked on the island where 
Bering died and which bears his 
name. The naturalist of the ex- 
pedition, Geog Wilhelm Steller, 
recognized it as an enormously 
large relative of the manatee and 
the dugong. They were up to 25 
feet in length and lived in the 
shallow water around the island, 
forming distinctive small herds. 
Steller said that they were num- 
erous around the island all year 
round, but that he had never 
seen one before anywhere else. 

About 1880 A. E- Nordenskiold 
collected all the material about 
the animal that could be found 
in Russian archives. In 1754 the 
vessel of one Ivan Krassilnikov 
was provisioned with the flesh 
and hides of the artic sea cow. 



and in 1762 somebody named 
Korovin did the same. But in 
1772 Dimitri Bragin, who had 
been instructed to keep a journal 
on animal life in these waters, 
failed to see one. Other negative 
reports followed. Therefore 
Brandt in St. Petersburg (the 
one who named solenodon) con- 
cluded that the animal had been 
exterminated around 1768. 

This was a mistake. Reports 
on sea cow hunts made in 1779 
and 1780 were found later, and 
the Russian archives contained 
a statement about a sighting of 
a sea cow during the year 1854. 
Nordenskiold, after reading all 
the reports, decided that the arc- 
tic sea cow had not been exterm- 
inated in 1768, but driven away 
from the island. But he conclud- 
ed that they then became extinct 
anyway because their new habi- 
tat did not offer them favorable 
conditions. 

After the report from the 
Buran it seems that Norden- 
skiold was both right and wrong. 
They were not exterminated at 
Bering Island, but dispersed. 
However, they found new habi- 
tats which permitted them to 
survive. —WILLY LEY

AND THE MAIDEN

She was doomed as a sacrifice 
to the god her people feared.

A great unrest was among the 
people, for the time of de- 
cision was again at hand. The 
Elders voted upon the candi- 
dates and the sacrifice was af- 
firmed over the objections of 
Ryllik, the oldest. 

“It is wrong to capitulate 
thus,” he argued. 

But they did not answer him, 
and the young virgin was taken 
to the grotto of smokes and fed 
the leaves of drowsiness. 

Ryllik watched with disap- 
proval. 

“It should not be so,” he stat- 
ed. “It is wrong.” 

“It has always been so,” said 
the others, “in the spring of the 
year, and in the fall. It has al- 
ways been so.” And they cast 
worried glances down the trail 
to where the sun was pouring 
morning upon the world. 

The god was already travel- 
ling through the great-leafed 
forest. 

“Let us go now,” they said. 

“Did you ever think of stay- 
ing? Of watching to see what the 
monster god does?” asked Ryllik 
bitterly. 

“Enough of your blasphem- 
ies! Come along!” 

Ryllik followed them. 



“We grow fewer every year,” 
'■■ n said. “One day we shall no 
longer have any sacrifices left to 
offer.” 

“Then that day we die,” said 
the others. 

“So why prolong it?” he asked. 
“Let us fight them — now, be- 
fore we are no more!” 

But the others shook their 
heads, a summary of that resig- 
nation Ryllik had watched grow 
as the centuries passed. They all 
respected Ryllik’s age, but they 
did not approve of his thoughts. 
They cast one last look back, 
just as the sun caught the clank- 
ing god upon his gilt-caparisoned 
~nount, his death-lance slung at 
his side. Within the place where 
the smokes were bom the maiden 
thrashed her tail from side to 
side, rolling wild eyes beneath 
her youthful browplates. She 
sensed the divine presence and 
began to bellow. 

They turned away and lum- 
bered across the plains. 

As they neared the forest 
Ryllik paused and raised a sca- 
ley forelimb, groping after a 
thought. Finally, he spoke: 

“I seem to have memory,” 
said he, “of a time when things 
were different.” END

RENAISSANCE 



by 

WYMAN 

GUIN 




VTow that the revolution was 
^ a success the little Cha- 
cone and I were staying at the 
Stone Inn. As you might sus- 
pect from the name, there is not 
a piece of rock in the whole 
building. Nevertheless, it is the 



best address on my home island. 

I sat at a window of my par- 
lor and watched the street- 
lamps gutter in oily smoke. The 
first gray of dawn pearled the 
mists between the lights. With 
day approaching, you could hear 
an occasional patter of 
feet on the worn, plank streets. 



107 




The voices of our guards came 
more frequently from far and 
near. 

“Halt, for inspection!” 

1 felt a sigh heave my chest. 
The rebel leader and I had not 
commanded our forces very 
brilliantly. There had been 
much more billing than I had 
anticipated. The defenders of 
the false king, together with our 
own dead, had been piled in 
the streets, and in the courtyard 
of the Tower, and up all the 
stairs of the Tower. Every burial 
pool on the island had been 
crowded with mourners for two 
days now. 

From where I sat listening to 
the first stirring of the frighten- 
ed city, I could see the dim 
lights in the shabby Tower of 
my home island. Our kings have 
never lived higher than six lev- 
els above the sea. Even the poor 
little island of Tome has a high- 
er Tower. 

Tonight, all of the rooms of 
our Tower were lighted as a 
protection for the young prince 
whom we had taken from his 
prison and placed in the tower 
the night before last. We had 
him under the protection of the 
first overlord and those soldiers 
from the old army who had 
joined the revolution. The first 
overlord was now preparing the 
Tower for the ceremony at 
noon, today, in which the 



prince would be made king. Un- 
til that ceremony there was dan- 
ger everywhere. 

nphe people were happy about 
the death of the false king 
and about the placing of the 
young prince in the Tower. 
It was my own plans they were 
against. They wanted no part of 
my scheme to bind two other 
small, floating islands to our is- 
land and create one large, rich 
island. I had not lived on my 
home island since childhood 
and I was, to my rude people, 
a fancy foreigner with educated 
ideas. 

Across the gray fog, appeared 
the first ochre streams of day. 
Sha’tule, our yellow sun, would 
rise shortly. About an hour later 
his bluish twin, Sha’cham, 
would come up. Then the fog 
would melt. 

There was a gentle knock at 
the door between our apart- 
ments and the little Chacone 
entered. She was dressed in 
mourning for the “rebel dead.” 

Her black sheath did little to 
obscure her figure, and it set off 
her beautiful face dramatically. 
She was wearing a royal funer- 
al tiara of the black diamonds 
that are mined by divers in the 
shallow Sea of Mourning. This 
was her right, since the beauti- 
ful women of Chacone are made 
true queens before they leave 



108 



GALAXY 



the island. From wherever in 
the world their masters may 
live, they participate by messen- 
ger in the highest affairs of 
Chacone. After all, the whole 
island is supported by these 
rare women. 

“She hesitated at the door to 
make sure she was not intrud- 
ing. “I heard you moving about 
over an hour ago.” 

“I am just waiting for noon. 
Nothing is safe until noon.” 

Up the street I thought I 
glimpsed a furtive scuffle. 

She was approaching me and 
I raised a hand. “Did you hear a 
cry?” 

She stopped, but she did not 
glance out into the fog. “I heard 
nothing.” 

“I thought I heard a cry.” 

Now she came directly to me. 
She took my hands and raised 
them until I followed with my 
body to stand over her. 

S he said, “Darling, you are de- 
pressed about the killing. You 
have killed because you had to. 
Now, in a few hours, your peo- 
ple will have a good king.” 

‘T killed because I want to 
bind three poor little islands in- 
to one rich, big island.” 

I spoke with conscious melo- 
drama. “The men who died will 
never share that wealth. The 
men who live do not want it.” 
I kissed her and went on. “To 



put things clearly, the so-called 
‘false’ king is ‘false’ only because 
he is dead. He got that way be- 
cause he refused to sign the 
treaty I want with the islands of 
Tome and Parsos. 

“He was a better administra- 
tor than this prince will be. 
Don’t forget, I taught this prince 
while he attended the Univer- 
sity of Hahn. I can tell you, he 
is something of a lout. But he 
will sign the treaty as I wish it, 
and so, he is a ‘true’ king, in my 
estimation.” 

She put her golden arms 
about my shoulders and kissed 
my mouth. Since she had been 
trained from childhood in every 
nuance of love, and since she 
loved me deeply, it was a kind 
of kiss that would have made a 
common man throw sticks at his 
bride. 

Her lips broke with a little 
laugh and she drew back. “Dar- 
ling, I must be seen in my funer- 
al finery. Won’t you take me 
down to the dining room?” 

Without offense she had in- 
terjected a little light-hearted- 
ness. Since arriving on my is- 
land a few weeks ago we had a 
joke about her. 

In their natural habitat — the 
great cities on the rich islands 
of the world — the Chacone 
women display no vanity. For 
thousands of years die Chacon- 
ese have lived in ritual polyan- 



A MAN Of THE RENAISSANCE

dry, breeding and perfecting 
these beautiful creatures for ex- 
port. These women are so ac- 
complished in manners and so 
talented in the arts that it usual- 
ly does not occur to an ordinary 
woman to envy them. Still, there 
are always a few who do, and 
on many islands the native word 
for female vanity has been re- 
placed by a phrase that means, 
“trying to act like a Chacone”. 

"fTThHe we had lived on the 
’ ’ rich island of Hahn, she 
had been simply, the most beau- 
tiful Chacone anyone had even 
seen. Here on this naive little 
island where none of the last 
three kings had been able to af- 
ford a Chacone, she was the 
most beautiful human anyone 
had ever seen. The adulation 
had shocked her at first. Then 
she had begun to revel in it be- 
cause, once my people accept a 
stranger, it is all the way to the 
heart. 

So we had this joke — that 
she was a Chacone trying to act 
like a vain wife. With her lit- 
tle parody, she had made me 
face the fact that my “guilt” 
about the killing was as unnec- 
essary as her ‘Vanity”. 

For the first time since we 
had got the prince into the first 
overlord’s protection and the 
fighting had ceased, I began to 
get a grip on my depression. 



“My marvelous little Cha- 
cone!” I took her sweet face in 
my hands and kissed her again. 

I debated about arming my- 
self to go down to breakfast. 
Then I put on the Great Blade 
of Hahn and tucked my steel 
knife into my sash. 

As I reached to open the door 
to the hallway, to let the Cha- 
cone pass through, there was a 
knock on it. I pressed her back 
and drew the knife and opened 
the door a crack. It was the big 
rebel leader. 

We grasped forearms affec- 
tionately, and he bowed with re- 
spect to the Chacone. 

As we went down the hall to- 
ward the stairs he fell into step 
beside me. 

“There are things I do not 
like.” 

“For example?” 

“The Tower is locked.” 

“The Tower is always locked 
on the day a king is made.” 

“Nevertheless, there are things 
I do not like. I am going to have 
a close look at everything.” 

T'Vownstairs he bowed again to 
the Chacone. To me he said, 
“I will be back before Sha’cham 
rises.” 

He had succeeded in stirring 
some unease in me. When the 
Chacone and I entered the din- 
ing room, I let the attendant 
take my cloak and feathered 



110 



GALAXY 



hat, but I kept my Great Blade 
and my knife. 

We were no more than seated 
at our table when I caught a 
flash erf evidence that I was 
right to be alert. A man at a 
table against the wall made a 
mistake. 

He was having flashed gull 
eggs for breakfast. Instead of 
driving his sipping tube through 
the shell of the egg he was hold- 
ing, he punched a delicate hole 
in it with his thumb nail. 

He froze, and I swept my eyes 
to the face of the Chacone be- 
fore he could inspect the dining 
room. The islands held by sea 
bandits have never adopted the 
sipping tube which is proper ev- 
erywhere else. 

I smiled at the Chacone and 
then made a disinterested survey 
of the room. He was looking di- 
rectly at me. He had picked me 
as the only guest who might 
have noticed that a spy from the 
sea bandits had just broken an 

egg. 

On any island where there is 
political strife, and even on is- 
lands where these clever men 
can smell it coming, there are 
spies for the sea bandits. When 
these spies report that an island 
is sufficiently divided and weak- 
ened, the bandits come in for 
brief, bloody raids. 

I decided that as long as this 
man was worried about the 



manner in which he ate his 
eggs, we were safe from such a 
raid. Now that we knew him, he 
could be watched and it would 
be time enough to worry if he 
disappeared. 

“Waiter.” 

He came around the table 
from where he had been watch- 
ing the boys put saucers of fruit 
before us and fill our glasses 
with spiced rainwater. 

“Yes, Master?” 

“What is that shouting out in 
the street?” 

“Both of the local printers 
have sheets out this morning 
that tell of the revolution. Shall 
I send one of the children?” 
“Please do.” 

T Te beckoned an urchin of less 
than six years from the 
comer of the room and sent him 
for the papers. 

“Is that all before I serve 
your first course. Master?” 

“No. Look me in the eye.” 
This waiter had been very 
loyal to the revolution. He stood 
still and looked me in the eye. 

“The man against that wall is 
a spy for the bandits.” 

“Ahhhh ! Really?” 

He was staring hard into my 
eyes trying to remember the 
guests in the direction I had 
glanced. 

“Ahhhh! In the white blouse 
with lace?” 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



111 



I had only to nod once. 
“Really! I would never have 
guessed.” 

“Have him watched constant- 
ly.” 

“Of course.” 

“And waiter.” 

“Yes, Master?” 

“Sha’tule is up. Many of the 
guests here, who are trying to 
stare at my lady are looking di- 
rectly into the panes of this 
window. Why don’t we draw the 
curtain for their benefit.” 

A smile passed his lips. “How 
gracious of you, Master.” 

She gasped, “Oh!”, and with 
a little laugh, she popped a 
berry into her mouth. 

Just before the waiter drew 
the curtains, I saw dark sha- 
dows of soldiers race along the 
translucent panes on some 
emergency. 

I grinned at her. “I must say, 
you are being seen.” 

She dropped her delighted 
eyes in embarrassment. “Dar- 
ling, please! It was only a silly 
joke.” 

The child returned with both 
papers. I looked into the pale, 
pinched face that you see so 
often in these children of my 
home island, and I overtipped 
him lavishly. 

He hardly understood what I 
had given him. Instead of re- 
turning to his post in the cor- 
ner of the room, he raced from 



the inn for home and mother. 

The Chacone was shaking her 
head. “You shouldn’t do that, 
darling. He may be accused of 
stealing.” 

I shook my head in turn. “I 
don’t know why I do it to the 
little beggers.” 

XT either of us mentioned that 

^ I had a son of that age 
whom I had never seen. She 
simply reached out and covered 
the back of my hand with hers 
and asked, “May I have a pa- 
per, dear?” 

One of the printers was still 
using wooden type, but the oth- 
er had acquired the metal type 
that is now molded on the is- 
land of Hahn. I gave her the 
one printed with metal. 

We had been served hot bit- 
ter-berry tea, and we both sipped 
while we read. Abruptly, she 
started exclaiming in whispers. 

“Darling, it tells all about you 
here. It says that you are not 
just a Master of The Seven 
Arts, but the most learned and 
talented man in the world. It 
says that your books and scrolls 
are treasured by seven kings 
and countless lords. It says that 
your paintings in oil and your 
sculptures and your designs for 
the great Towers of the world 

ft 

are . 

“Does it say anything about 
my flying machine?” 



112 



GALAXY 



She glanced up and down the 
page. “No, I don’t see anything 
about that.” 

“I didn’t think you would. 
But if we had lost the revolution 
you would be reading a feature 
story about it.” 

“ Did you have a flying ma- 
chine?” 

“No, I had a machine that 
didn’t fly.” 

My paper, printed from the 
larger wooden type was quite 
thick and I began hunting with 
excited annoyance for some 
mention of my great plan to 
bind together my home isle and 
the islands of Tome and Parsos. 
I could find no mention of it. 

“Oh, darling, it tells about 
me! Listen! ‘For his work in 
developing the steel of the Great 
Blade of Hahn, the Master was 
given a beauteous Chacone by 
the king of Hahn. It is said that 
the king paid for her the high- 
est price ever paid to the Cha- 
conese.’ 

“Oh, darling, listen to this! 

‘Our whole citizenry has been 
grateful these past weeks for her 
gracious — ’ ” 

“My dear. Calm yourself!” 

“ — ‘for her gracious presence 
. her wit. her taste and artis- 
try . her . .!’ ” 

S he was becoming quite breath- 
less. I couldn’t help laughing. 
Her breathing stopped and she 



turned to me with the glazed 
stare of a completely ravished 
woman. “What was funny, dar- 
ling?” 

“I’ll tell you what let’s do. 
Give me that paper, now. Then, 
after breakfast, we’ll go upstairs 
and snuggle into bed and read 
to each other about ourselves. 
Won’t that be fun?” 

She handed me the paper obe- 
diently. “Don’t be silly.” 

While she sat in her daze, au- 
tomatically rebathing in adula- 
tion, I searched the metal print 
for any mention of my plan to 
bind together the three little is- 
lands. 

There was nothing. 

Slowly, I lowered the paper to 
the table. It was an ominous 
sign. They were dead against it. 
In the moment of our triumph 
they did not dare mention it. But 
when the time came they would 
try to swing the popular dislike 
of my plan to influence the new 
king against it. 

I heard my teeth gritting to- 
gether and I found that I was 
trembling with anticipatory 
rage. I had not led hundreds to 
their deaths, killing other hun- 
dreds only to let two smudge- 
fingered printers stand in my 
way. 

I saw that the spy for the sea 
bandits was leaving. Then he 
hesitated, staring at the door- 
way. 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



113

nnhe rebel leader was stand- 
ing in the entrance. There 
was an air of urgency about him. 
The spy would have given any- 
thing if he had not already risen 
and headed for the entrance, but 
it was too late now, and he passed 
oh out with only a glance at the 
rebel. 

When the big man reached 
our table, I saw what the spy 
had seen. The blunt face was 
chalked with shock, the pupils 
dilated, the breathing shallow 
and fast. 

I could feel the blood drain- 
ing from my own face. My whole 
body was straining; first to 
swell into a giant of rage, then 
to shrivel to a beetle and scuttle 
for the wall. 

He sat down, whispering 
hoarsely. “It is all lost. We have 
been tricked. The first overlord 
has locked the prince in the 
Tower dungeon. He commands 
the remnants of the old army 
against us. They have just taken 
the warehouse we were using as 
a garrison and killed over a 
hundred men.” 

I started to rise. 

He grabbed my arm and 
pulled me down. “Listen to me. 
We are safe as long as we don’t 
leave the hotel. Even if I’m cap- 
tured I do not think the first 
overlord will have me killed. It 



is you and your plan he wants to 
stop. We must get you off the 
island.” 

He continued with heavy 
breathing, “Now, listen. The 
bamboo forests are still in fog. 
I am preparing a guarded way 
for us through the alleys to the 
edge of the city. I am also pre- 
paring a fast ship for you and 
your lady. If we are cut off from 
that, I am having a raft pre- 
pared for you.” 

I stared at him. “Rebel, we 
are surrounded by desert seas 
right now. I can’t take a raft in- 
to those deserts.” 

“Master, I believe you can do 
anything. I only say that you 
cannot always do everything at 
once. If we are reduced to the 
raft, your lady will have to re- 
main.” 

The little Chacone was 
clutching and unclutching my 
hand in hers. I became aware 
that the dining room had be- 
come electrified with terror and 
was emptying. We three had be- 
come a focal point where the 
sudden threat of death hummed 
in the ears of those present like 
a stricken wasp. 

The waiter hurried up to us. 
“Master, I have heard about the 
treachery. But listen, there is 
more. The spy for the bandits 
has disappeared. In days, the 
sea about here will be swarming 
with them. If you were thinking 



114 



GALAXY 



of escaping with your lady ... I 
beg you, don’t.” 

Qhe was shaking her head 
^ piteously with tears glisten- 
ing on her cheeks. “Please don’t 
leave me. I do not fear any of 
these things. Please take me 
with you.” 

The rebel and I were staring 
at each other across the horrible 
thought of capture by sea ban- 
dits. I turned dazedly to the 
Chacone and shook my head. 

She buried her face and wept. 

The waiter declared, “Master, 
no harm will come to her. We 
will take good care of her.” 
Then he excused himself and 
hurried away. 

The rebel rose. “I will make 
one last check of the escape 
route while you say farewell to 
your lady.” He left the dining 
room by way of the kitchens. 

I stood up, and drew the Cha- 
cone up to me. Her lips moved 
warmly and her tears were hot 
on my face. Undoubtedly, for the 
last time, I was holding the 
world’s most fabulous prize in 
my arms. Yet death, buzzing in- 
sistantly in my ears reminded me 
that I had been condemned, long 
ago, to love another. 

The woman I loved was beau- 
tiful, but not this beautiful; ta- 
lented, but not this talented; 
royal, but not his regal. She 
was the mother of my son, and 



perhaps I was condemned to 
love her simply because I could 
not have her. 

I kissed the dear little Cha- 
cone over and over and prom- 
ised her that I would return. 
Then I found that I was prom- 
ising to return with soldiers and 
retake the Tower. 

So there it was in the open . 
the killing had not yet been 
enough. It had only been in 
vain. Whether or not the sea 
bandits came I would come 
again, to kill again for my plan 
to bind together the three is- 
lands. 

^Tphe rebel and I had no dif- 
ficulty reaching the edge of 
the city. We were beckoned 
from point to point by our 
waiting comrades. Trouble be- 
gan immediately when we enter- 
ed the forests of bamboo. 

A rebel came racing toward 
us from ochre banners of fog. 
“They have captured the boat 
and the three men guarding it. 
Take this side path to the raft. 
Hurry, they are right behind 
me. 

He gestured wildly and fell at 
our feet with a javelin in his 
back. We raced into the forest 
where the light of Sha’tule beat 
at the fog with a golden ham- 
mer. 

Shrieks and moans from a 
thousand lost souls burst from 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE

the path ahead of us. I stopped 
dead in the path and the big 
rebel crashed into me. 

We both simultaneously recog- 
nized the din as the pipes and 
strings of funeral music. The 
scale in which my people play 
their harsh instruments is for- 
tunately unknown on other is- 
lands. 

The rebel leader was press- 
ing me forward. “Move in and 
mingle with the mourners. They 
will be hurrying the funeral to 
avoid the Sun Gods. They will 
not notice.” 

Masked by the racket and 
concentration of the ceremony, 
we went in among the mourners 
who encircled the pool. Smoking 
torches still fluttered along the 
edge of the golden bowl of light 
above the pool . light that was 
now fretted with the blue of 
Sha’cham. A red-shrouded 
corpse was poised over the wa- 
ter on his bamboo slide. The 
bural stone to which his feet 
were bound was a rich one, fully 
a hand thick, and as big around 
as a man could encircle with his 
arms. 

The wailing of the instru- 
ments ceased, and now the big 
rebel, his rock-like face un- 
moved, worked to still his deep 
breathing. 

On all sides, presently, I could 
hear the soldiers moving quiet- 
ly. They inspected the mourners 



from a pious distance and they 
passed right by us. 

The Shaman mounted his 
stand at the head of the reclin- 
ing corpse. After a long time in 
which little accidental sounds 
ceased, he started reading from 
his sacred scroll. 

“All things that live on land 
all the animals of the islands 
and the cities of men on the is- 
lands, float at the surface of the 
sea where there is storm and 
sinking and terror.” 

Suddenly the widow, who 
stood with her friends beside the 
Shaman’s place, lifted her arms 
to the thinning fog and shrieked 
a curse. With a bound of my 
heart, I recognized that it was 
me at whom she hurled this ha- 
tred. The rebel turned to me, 
and he could not help grinning. 

There was a little commotion 
near the widow and the rudely 
grinning rebel used the moment 
to whisper, “Master, they are 
praising you.” 

M ow it made my throat ache 
’ to see this corpse. He had 
been Captain of the Guard 
at the Tower, and last to stand 
before the door to the apart- 
ments of the false king. I had 
to run the brave man through. 

The Shaman went on with his 
reading. “On the currents of the 
worldwide sea, our islands drift 
to the north and they drift to 



116 



GALAXY 



the south. They bring us to the 
depredations of the Ice Island- 
ers. Our islands drift into the 
boiling waters of steam and 
pumicine and into the chill wa- 
ters of ice and snow. 

“All these terrors are con- 
trolled by the evil eyes of the 
stars which control all things at 
the surface of the sea.” 

This belief is the reason 
funerals are held at dawn or 
sunset. They want the dead to 
go to the sea floor without be- 
ing seen by the evil stars or 
wrathful Sun Gods. 

The Shaman continued. “But 
the eyes of the stars do not reach 
to the Floor of the Sea. Down 
there, where decay cannot occur, 
far from the storm and terror of 
living, there go all the dead . 

Behind me a soldier coughed 
nervously, and from the other 
side of the pool, another also 
coughed. The rebel smiled sym- 
pathetically. 

The Shaman had reached that 
part of sacred belief that is most 
distressing to a man of action, 
and presently I could hear the 
soldiers begin moving away. In 
the thinking of the pious, the 
Floor of the Sea is a great, 
calm plain on which, in static 
promenade, the buried dead 
stand about in the blue shrouds 
of women and the red shrouds 
of men, their feet bound to their 
burial stones, contemplating for 



the eternity the asqueous silence. 

Unable to bear such a pros- 
pect, the sailor has invented the 
lascivious Sea Women, and the 
soldier has named our twin suns 
Sha’tule and Shal’cham . 
“commander of the dead that 
arise as mists,” and “commander 
of the dead that arise as storms”. 

'TT'he drums about the burial 
pool began to murmur and 
the slide bearing the corpse was 
slowly tilted. I thought the brave 
captain would never let go of 
his slide. Then, as the drums 
reached a deafening roar, it was 
as though he remembered some 
gleeful prospect, so abruptly did 
he shoot into the black water. 

My throat ached, but I found 
there were no words to say to 
him. 

To make sure we would lose 
the soldiers, the rebel and I re- 
turned toward the city for a 
way with the mourners. We left 
them where a narrow path head- 
ed back toward the island’s 
edge. We raced down this still 
protected from any distant view 
by the thinning fog. The ground 
grew softer and now, only a few 
feet beneath us, was the sucking 
of the sea. 

The rebel motioned to me and 
stopped. He studied things 
through the fog a bit and then 
whispered. “They are guarding 
the paths ahead. If we don’t slip 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



117 



through them, run for the am- 
phibial.” 

I whispered back. “Listen, if 
we are separated, tell our people 
I have gone to Thule for sol- 
diers.” 

He stared at me in disbelief. 
“I thought the king of Thule 
had condemned you to the 
plank?” 

“He will have forgiven me.” 

He continued to stare at me 
and shook his head. “Master, 
you have lost your mind to go 
back there.” 

Behind me a man shouted 
very loudly, “Aaaaeeee, here!” 

Ill 

T T e was hurling a bone-pointed 
■*- javelin and it was sad for 
him that he missed my face. 
I drew the gleaming Blade 
of Hahn, the blade a stride long, 
a length unheard of in most of 
the world. I took two steps and 
ran him through. 

The rebel was calling to me, 
“This way.” 

Soldiers rose out of the shal- 
low ground, eager and yelling. I 
heard all about us as we ran, that 
dry whisper of death — arrows 
clipping through the bashai 
leaves. We plunged into the rank 
growth of the amphibial where 
the thin ground waved under 
foot, where the thicket crawled 
with deadly snakes and toads. 



While an island drifts 
through tropic waters it is bor- 
dered with this pumicine pack 
and its wildly growing plant life. 
No man would willingly venture 
there and the soldiers did not fol- 
low. They stood on the higher 
ground and waited. 

When we started to move we 
waved the head-high, pulpy 
bush. A shower of arrows snick- 
ered through the leaves. There 
was laughter from the shore. 
They had themselves a real 
sport. If they didn’t hit us, the 
snakes would. 

I went ahead of the rebel with 
my Great Blade and in thirty 
stops I cut six filthy snakes. The 
soldiers showered arrows increas- 
ingly wide of us as the stir we 
caused drew out of their sight. 
Finally, we were free of the sol- 
diers and there was only the 
great, hot hush of the amphibial 
about us. 

The island had not passed 
through a storm in many months 
and so the amphibial was un- 
usually solid. Even so, we 
stepped through the treach- 
erously waving earth frequently, 
and once the rebel went clear 
through till I grabbed the bushy 
hair of his head. 

Sha’tule, and Sha’cham were 
high now and boiled down into 
the thicket. Clouds of insects 
made our progress torment. 

What a curse it is that this 



118 



GALAXY 



great military barrier around 
every island fails us when we 
need it most. As our islands 
drift north or south toward the 
Ice Islanders, the encircling 
amphibial shrivels. Creeping 
roots that have collected these 
great pumicine packs and rot- 
ting leaves in the long tropic 
heat now freeze. The snakes and 
poisonous toads retreat to the 
more solid land and burrow. 
The chill waves smash away all 
but a little rim of the once for- 
bidding amphibial and when 
the Ice Islanders come in their 
fearsome, homed boats we must 
defend every pace of the frozen 
shore. 

nphe rebel leader, an older 
man than I, floundered more 
and more frequently. One man 
cannot carry another, or any 
great burden, without breaking 
through such thin ground. We 
were desperate by the time we 
came upon a small boating chan- 
nel. 

The fishers maintain these 
channels with walls and bottom 
woven of bamboo. As an island 
heads for the tropics and an am- 
phibial grows about it, the fish- 
ers add these cradles of bamboo 
making a channel to the sea for 
their craft. 

We crawled onto the over- 
head cross members separating 
the bamboo walls of this chan- 



nel. We lay in the hot sunlight 
unable to care what might hap- 
pen. 

At last I asked him, “Is the 
raft in this channel?” 

He nodded without speaking 
to me. 

It was mid-moming before we 
let ourselves down into the sea 
water and swam silently back to 
the land. 

Two soldiers with bone-point- 
ed javelins stood on the floating 
wharf watching the shore and 
whispering to each other. A raft 
had been upended on the wharf 
for repairs and the two stood 
with this between themselves 
and the shore. Not once as we 
approached did they worry 
about the surrounding amphib- 
ial. 

I drew the rebel to me and 
whispered to him while our toes 
rested on the bamboo cross mem- 
bers at the bottom of the chan- 
nel. With our heads barely 
above water we moved cautious- 
ly ahead. 

When we reached the end of 
the wharf they were about ten 
paces away. I nodded to the reb- 
el and he sank from sight. 

I counted methodically to 20. 
I drew my steel knife and threw 
it, a flash of light, between the 
ribs of the man on the left. His 
companion turned in astonish- 
ment. I grimaced and hissed a 
curse. He raised his javelin as, 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



119 



behind him, the rebel mounted 
the wharf. 

I ducked and the javelin 
boiled into the water over my 
shoulders. I raised my head to 
see him kneeling with coy sur- 
prise before he rolled into the 
water. I mounted the wharf and 
retrieved my knife. We hurried 
to a fishing raft that was some- 
what larger and more substantial 
than the others. 

The rebel loosened the moor- 
ings. “You will have to do with 
what provisions are here,” he 
whispered. 

I turned to him in stunned 
disbelief. “Isn’t it stocked? 
Are you trying to kill me? I 
have to cross a desert sea.” 
“Something has gone wrong. 
This isn’t the raft we had pre- 
pared.” 

I opened the floor box of the 
raft and glimpsed gaffing rods 
and a coil of rope. I cast about 
the wharf frantically until I saw 
one of those huge baskets which 
fishermen sometimes tow behind 
them filled with live fish. I 
brought this and threw it onto 
the deck while the rebel was 
shoving past the end of the float- 
ing wharf. I leaped two paces to 
the deck and he handed me a 
paddle. 

“I will help you paddle out 
to sea. If soldiers appear before 
we are out of sight I can duck 



back into the amphibial until 
dark.” 

Standing on opposite sides of 
the raft we paddled it back out 
the channel to the bobbing beds 
of free pumicine. I moored to 
the last bamboo stays of the 
channel and we rested. 

He was a big man with a de- 
termined face and a blunt way. 
“I am not sure you will return. 
Your cause is not our cause.” 

“My cause includes your cause. 
We both want the young prince 
made king. Once he is king I 
will be able to take my business 
to him.” 

“You are sure he will sign 
the treaties you want with the 
islands of Torne and Parsos?” 

“I know him. After all, I was 
his teacher when he was a boy. 
I taught him the first two of the 
Seven Arts.” 

“You think the King of Tome 
and Parsos will sign?” 

“They have already signed a 
proposal.” 

“What do they gain by this?” 

I began to unroll the split 
bamboo sail. Since the wind was 
from the land the raft pulled at 
its mooring. 

It made me angry to talk with 
him about this. Why could not 
the people of my homeland see 
that they would have no lasting 
prosperity until they federated 
with other freely floating 
islands? 



120 



GALAXY 



r T~'he kings of Tome and Par- 
-*■ sos were both convinced 
that my plan was feasible to 
bind together with great ropes 
these small islands so that even- 
tually they would grow together 
in the tropic lushness. When 
next their lands drifted out of 
the north seas clean of amphib- 
ial, they planned to erect the 
great sails I had designed. They 
would try to maneuver their is- 
lands together and bind them. 
With three islands thus bound 
there would be so much less 
shore to defend and so many 
more to defend it the next time 
we drifted against the Ice Is- 
landers. Such a man-joined is- 
land, ruled by these three peace- 
ful Kings, would be as wealthy 
and powerful as the great rock 
latched islands of Thule and 
Hahn. 

But the people of my home- 
land are stubborn and arrogant. 
The former king, who had ob- 
tained the Tower falsely, would 
never listen to me. So I had 
joined these rebels to place the 
young prince to whom I could 
talk in the Tower. One could not 
talk to these stubborn rebels 
about joining peaceful hands 
with a sister island. They were 
as independent as sea-going tur- 
tles. 

This one shook his head pro- 
foundly. “You worry too much 
about the Ice Islanders. I 



wouldn’t sleep on the same is- 
land with a Tomian. They are 
root grubbers.” 

I had the sail fully hoisted 
and the raft jerked at its moor- 
ing. He did not take the hint, so 
I went back and squatted near- 
the rope to untie it. 

I turned and snapped, “You, 
rebel, have not been taken from 
your home as a boy by the Ice 
Islanders. You have not spent 
two years as their slave. You are 
a small-island man and you 
think like a small . .” 

Suddenly, I saw on the sea 
over his shoulder, what had hap- 
pened to the raft that had been 
prepared for me. Four soldiers 
paddled it swiftly, silently to- 
ward us. 

nphe rebel, as if answering 
my insult with an impudent 
gesture, thrust at me from his 
mouth the barbed head of an 
arrow. 

I spun backward, drawing the 
Great Blade. I slashed the moor- 
ing, and the raft leaped into the 
pumicine beds. As a second ar- 
row sang over the deck, I tore 
open the lid to the deck box and 
dived into this narrow confine, 
jabbing myself painfully on a 
gaffing hook. Two more arrows 
thudded into the deck and then 
no more. I peeked out and saw 
that the soldiers were struggling 
to mount their sail. 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



121 




They would draw more wa- 
ter, and I was sure they could 
not overtake me. Nevertheless, 
I spent little ceremony in dis- 
posing of the dead rebel and as- 
sisting my flight by paddle. 
Soon they gave up the chase and 
headed back for the channel. I 
stopped paddling and let the sail 
bounce me over the pumicine. 

Across our seas drift great 
reaches of this stone, some as 
large as a man’s thumb tip, and 
most much smaller. If one cuts 
a piece of this stone on a lapi- 
dary’s wheel he will find it 
filled with air spaces. If one 
digs anywhere on an island he 
will find, beneath the soil of 
rotted vegetation, a thick 



ground of pumicine tightly mat- 
ted in wiry roots. On an old 
rock-latched island such as 
Thule, this base may be ten 
times as deep as a man stands. 

IV 

I t is the belief of the pious 
that the islands were bom 
in antiquity by fabled Sea God- 
desses who sometimes cohabited 
with the Sun Gods. Thus, it is 
said that the beautiful isle of 
Ohme, which never leaves its 
narrowly circling current in the 
tropics, was begat by Sha’tule, 
commander of the mist. It is 
said that the Sea Goddess, Tora, 
in gratitude for this delightful 



122 



GALAXY 




her womb until it was the most 
beautiful in the world. She is 
said to have travailed for a thou- 
sand years to create Ohme, 
where the tiny red deer bound 
across emerald meadows and the 
balloon flowers loose themselves 
from their branches at night and 
copulate above the tree tops 
with little cries. 

A man who notices what he 
sees instead of what he hears 
will not believe that Ohme, or 
any other island, was bom in 
such a way. 

In my lifetime our knowl- 
edge of the world has grown 
tremendously, and we are not so 
likely to believe that Sea God- 



to treasure them as myth. 

I think this: the islands are 
being built each day. There are 
forces building them and forces 
tearing them apart In many 
parts of the ocean, such as Chryo 
where stupendous rocks reach 
to the clouds, there are great 
boiling places out of which 
gouts of pumidne are coughed 
up from the water. In addition 
there are many places in the sea 
where cones of hot rock and fire 
rise high in the sky and two 
of these are near the rock-latched 
island of Hahn. From all these 
places comes stone filled with air- 
spaces. 

Where beds of such pumicine 



123 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



float in calm seas you find them 
strewn with plantlife, and if the 
time is long enough you can 
pick up clumps of floating stone 
tightly bound in wiry roots and 
already plastered on the under- 
side with the bulbous red leaves 
of the bottom plant. Such a 
clump is a primitive little is- 
land which is being borne only 
figuratively in the womb of a 
Sea Goddess. For the bottom 
plants suck up water and strain 
it of salt and deliver fresh wa- 
ter to the planets above. These 
in their turn are spread in the 
sunlight, which plants must 
have, and somehow they ex- 
change sunlight with the 
bottom plants that were always 
in the sea. 

I think that shallow islands 
such as Chacone, where the soil 
is brackish and unfit for agri- 
culture, will one day be deep is- 
lands like Thule. After a storm 
on any island, you find pumi- 
cine in the funeral pools which 
means it has been driven in un- 
der the island where it may be 
incorporated by the muscular 
bottom plants into a deeper 
ground. 

4 t last I was free of the 
pumicine beds of my home 
isle. Now, about me ,the green 
sea swelled like white-nippled 
breasts of the necrophilic sea- 
women. The raft slapped from 



wave to wave with a busy illu- 
sion of progress. I stepped for- 
ward of the sail and watched the 
horizon where a blue line lay. 
I decided that I had about two 
hours before I would be leaving 
the green sea. 

I lashed the basket in the wa- 
ter at the rear of the raft, and 
used one of the gaffing hooks to 
land my food before I reached 
the desert. I was able to bring 
in six large blue-stripes without 
harming them unduly and I 
dropped them into the basket. A 
seventh, I left on the deck for 
tonight’s food. 

I reached the endless blue of 
the desert. There would be no 
fishing here. The sparse plank- 
ton supported no life. Now my 
progress fretted me. The im- 
probability of success began to 
depress me. The first overlord 
would probably assume the 
kingship tomorrow. Now was 
the time to overthrow him 
while the people were bitter that 
the young prince had not been 
placed. 

Now was the time, and here I 
sat slapping from wave to wave. 
Worst of all had been the death 
of the rebel leader. Now the 
rebels would have to rise spon- 
taneously when and if I reap- 
peared. 

Prospects were even gloomier 
ahead of me on Thule. I was go- 
ing there to beg soldiers from a 



124 



GALAXY 



man who had last looked upon 
me in fabulous rage and had 
cried out in anguish, “Give him 
one hundred lashes. Nail him to 
a plank and put him adrift at 
sea.” 

I had been saved from that 
punishment. I had escaped to 
Parsos where the king had giv- 
en me refuge against every 
threat and bribe from Thule. 
But I could not go to Parsos or 
Torne for help in this venture. 
If their soldiers came storming 
into my home isle killing lords 
and overlords — even putting 
the young prince in the Tower 
would not sooth the feelings of 
my people. After such a day 
there would never be a treaty 
such as I wanted. 

'""T'he only source of soldiers 
close enough this year to be 
feasible was the rock-latched is- 
land of Thule near which our 
present currents were carrying 
us. The source was a good one. 
I was simply the worst possible 
ambassador. 

I had heard that the rage of 
the king toward me had cooled. 
Definitely he had not tom down 
the Great Tower of Thule though 
at first he had threatened to do 
so. 

How could he have done 
that? Of all my works, the Great 
Tower for the king of Thule is 
the crowning achievement. The 



huge platform on which it 
stands is built of hardwood 
raided from the Ice Islanders 
and is a hundred paces square. 
On the upper floors, I had di- 
rected a hundred lapidaries for 
two years to finish the mosaics 
of the outer walls. These are of 
ivory and pearl, wood and 
stone. They depict all the alle- 
gories of the Sea Dieties and the 
highest levels depict the epics 
of the ancestors of the king of 
Thule. 

The wood panels on the inner 
walls I had painted magically in 
oil so that the human form and 
all the animals and fishes of the 
world are seen in delightful 
poses and so real that the eye is 
bewitched. 

This Tower rises fourteen lev- 
els over its massive columns, 
gleaming high above the lesser 
Towers of lords of Thule. Truly, 
the king of Thule is raised above 
the sea. How could he have 
brought himself to destroy such 
a work? And every day that he 
lived in those halls he looked 
upon the message of my hand. 
Surely he would have softened 
toward me. 

That night I ate the raw fish 
and drank its water. I lay on my 
back watching the stars. I was 
steady on course. The Shaman 
say the stars are “evil eyes” that 
create all disaster. A man who 
thinks does not credit such talk. 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



125 



A man who sails, (and who- 
ever heard of a sailor Shaman?) 
knowns the stars as friends. 

There are many wonderful 
thoughts in the world today, new 
ideas that thrill you. One, that 
is most exciting to me, is the 
theory of the aged professor of 
astronomy at the University of 
Parsos. This theory is that the 
stars are really suns like Sha- 
tule and Sha’charn and that 
they are so small only because 
they are far from us. I like to 
think that there may be other 
worlds on which those suns 
shine. 

I have tried to think of oth- 
er worlds, for example, one 
where the sea would be almost 
dried up, perhaps by a closer 
sun. On such a world parts of 
the bottom of the sea might be 
exposed. Plants might grow on 
the exposed sea floor just as they 
do on pumicine. Animals would 
walk on solid rock. The Ice Is- 
anders have great piles of rock 
which rise out of the ice and in- 
to the clouds and on which the 
hardwood grows. I mean . the 
whole world would be like that, 
and the islands would not move. 

. Tonight I tired of thinking of 
such different worlds and I 
wished that the little Chacone 
were with me. 

When I awakened the suns 
lay hot on the horizon. I was 



startled. Hurriedly I checked 
the sea about me, and as a good 
seaman should, I looked into 
the suns. 

It is a good thing that I did. 
I recognized her at once. Prac- 
tically all the ships sailed by sea 
bandits are built to a pattern. 
This ship came at me like a 
great, black bat skimming be- 
tween the suns, and I had only 
moments to prepare. My heart 
fluttered wildly into my constrict- 
ed throat. 

I would die, but I would not 
be tortured. 

I jerked open the deck box of 
the raft and brought out the 
gaffing polls. The advice of an 
old merchant seaman raced in 
my mind. 

“I’ve boarded three of ’em and 
there’s only one way to do it. 
They always approach you on 
their windward because that’s 
high-boarding for them.” 

I wanted them to board me 
forward of my sail. Aft of the 
sail, I rammed the butts of the 
gaffing polls through the bam- 
boo and braced them in the 
logs. Their vicious points were 
a formidable barrier to boarding 
there. I snatched the coil of 
rope out of the deck box and 
formed a noose as they bore 
down on me. 

I cotinted nine men leaning 
over the rail and one at the rud- 
der. Three of the men, hesitat- 



126 



GALAXY 



ing before the ugly gaffing polls 
about me, leaped onto my for 
ward deck. 

I gave thanks to the rich la- 
dies of Hahn. They are la- 
vishly untrue to their husbands, 
and a student at that university 
is not worth his salt unless he 
can throw a noose to the second 
floor of a rich man’s Tower. The 
bandit ship swept past, and I 
caught the rudder pommel neat- 
ly- 

Desperation hoisted me to the 
railing, and one motion that 
drew and swung the Great Blade 
slashed the throat of the sur- 
prised helmsman. 

The bandits came at me to 
take a live prize, but when I 
opened the chest of a man from 
arm to arm they changed plan. 
The great Blade of Hahn is still 
as rare in the world as a king’s 
Tower and greatly feared by 
fighting men. These five ban- 
dits now saw what I carried and 
they hurled club and javelin to 
kill. A javelin laid bare one of 
my ribs and a club momentarily 
stunned me and I fell heavily to 
my knees. 

The voice of the old merchant 
man came back commandingly. 
“Board at the rudder and fight 
your way to the rear hatch.” I 
followed the voice in a gleam- 
ing frenzy of the Great Blade. 
They would flay me a little at a 

A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



time and salt my body if they 
took me. 

I jumped down the stairs and 
slammed and bolted the door to 
the captain’s cabin. Right be- 
hind me two of them hit it with 
terrifying fury. They would have 
it down in seconds, but if the 
old merchant man’s advice held 
up they would be too late. 

His voice lashed me to ac- 
tion. “Throw open the door to 
the forward compartment and 
jam it so you can see the for- 
ward hatch. Hurry back to the 
lee port in the captain’s cabin 
and open it. Reach way up and 
you can cut loose the boom.” 

I watched through the door I 
had opened and when I saw 
light at the forward hatch I 
slashed the lashing of the boom 
with my knife. There was a sick- 
ening lurch through the ship 
and two men screamed. A leg 
that had started down the lad- 
der in the forward hatch was 
whisked out again as if by the 
hand of a god. There followed 
two splashes in the sea. 

r T''he door to the captain’s ca- 
bin was splintering, and I 
dashed forward. I went up the 
hatch-ladder, blade first, and 
chopped off one of two bare feet 
that suddenly appeared before 
me on the deck. His unbalanced 
blow with a club smashed into 
the hatch and enough of my 



127 



head to knock northern lights 
through my brain. 

As I climbed groggily onto 
the deck I heard the two who 
had smashed open the captain’s 
door yell disappointment and 
clamber back up the rear hatch 
for the deck. 

The fellow who had lost a foot 
did not realize it. He was try- 
ing to come at me with a knife. 
His head flew off with one 
swing of the Great Blade, and 
the two who had come up out of 
the rear hatch witnessed this. 
When I approached them they 
backed off respectfully. One of 
them dropped a stone ax to the 
deck. Presently he turned and 
dove into the sea. 

The other man held a bone 
javelin hesitantly. I gestured 
over the side of the ship. He 
shook his head. I took a step 
toward him and he hurled the 
javelin. I chopped it out of the 
air. I raised the point of the 
Great Blade and I started back- 
ing him. When he reached the 
rail he just leaned away from 
the point until he fell over- 
board. 

Then I understood why he 
had not done as had his com- 
panion. He could not swim. I 
had to listen to his screams while 
I brought the sail down to re- 
trim the ship. 

The three men who had board- 
ed my raft had made some pro- 



gress. The man who had jumped 
overboard and one of the men 
who had been knocked over- 
board by the boom were swim- 
ming for the raft. 

The raft was still a hundred 
paces away when I began re- 
hoisting the sail and felt the 
trim little bandit slip tighten like 
an airborne bird. I set my course 
for Thule. 

By the time the raft was out 
of sight I had got rid of the bod- 
ies and swabbed the deck clean. 
Then I sat down near the tiller 
and carefully cleaned and pol- 
ished my Great Blade. 

What a marvel this metal was! 
Recently the Hahnese have been 
working the gray iron that flows 
from a fiery cone near their 
rock latched island. Now I had 
learned to work it with char- 
coal to make blades such as 
these. 

It had been for this the King 
of Hahn had given me the Cha- 
cone. 

Unlike the killing in the revo- 
lution, I had no remorse over 
the killing of the sea bandits. 
They are descendants of the Ice 
Islanders. For centuries their 
ancestors dominated our oceans; 
their raiding and slaughtering 
almost wiped civilization off of 
most islands. Those dark cen- 
turies were ended only by the 
rise of the great navies of Thule 
and Hahn which have pushed 



128 



GALAXY 



V 



the bandits back to a few poor 
islands from which they oper- 
ate. 

I was thinking these things as 
I finished cleaning the blade 
and I remembered that I had 
seen some writing on the table 
in the captain’s cabin. 

It is a seeming paradox that 
the bandits so love slaughter and 
torture that the most brutal man 
of another island shudders at the 
though of them — and yet they 
are said to be constant poets. 
The long sagas of their history 
are marvels of myth and they 
are said to leave a scene of 
slaughter with every man vying 
to compose the best verse about 
it. 

This captain had indeed been 
composing in a labored hand 
when I was sighted. His cup of 
morning tea had crashed to the 
floor when I later cut the boom. 
But the piece of parchment and 
his writing brush were where he 
had left them. 

“Up ecstatic towers we 
raced. 

With bone lance and flesh. 

Their women we pierced, 

Till thousands of doves. 

Were cooing for death.” 

I reflected over the savage 
faces of the morning and de- 
cided that the man whose chest 
I had opened had been the cap- 
tain. I tucked his lines under my 
sash. 

A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



\ s you approach Thule you 
understand that it takes a 
man two days to walk across 
this largest of all islands. It lies 
across the horizon like an end- 
less, green cloud. The rocks 
to which it is latched do not 
rise out of the soil. But the 
gleaming Tower of the King of 
Thule, which is my design, can 
be seen from the sea. 

Thule is the great stationary 
point of trade. All islands which 
are in currents that pass near her 
have cycles of industry and 
trade based on that fact. The 
approach near Thule is always 
festival time. When the currents 
bring an island into these wa- 
ters, the stores of its products 
are traded for the exotic prod- 
ucts from many islands. Even 
the Ice Islanders of the north 
sometimes appear in fearsome 
armadas to stand off Thule and 
conducted sullen trade. 

I had not had Thule on the 
horizon more than a short time 
when the sails of a fighting ship 
came out in my direction. At this 
latitude there is little growth of 
amphibial and they keep a close 
watch on the sea. My ship, ob- 
viously a sea bandit, brought 
this fighter out under taut sail. 

The fighter came about. The 
faces of the soldiers were many 
and they inspected every inch of 

129 



my deck. I lowered sail rapidly 
and waited. 

From about fifty paces the 
captain called to me. “Who are 
you?” 

I cupped my hands and called 
back, “I am a Master of the Sev- 
en Arts. I call on the King of 
Thule.” 

The captain ordered his sail 
down and we drifted together in 
silent waiting. The grim soldiers 
did not speak with each other. 
They watched my deck. The sol- 
diers of Thule are the finest in 
the world and their discipline is 
a thing to behold. The ship cap- 
tains are always Lords of Thule. 

“I’m alone.” 

“How did you come by this 
ship?” 

“I captured it.” 

“Alone?” 

“If you retrace my course 
you will pick up five ugly sea 
bandits adrift on my raft. The 
other five I killed and I have 
brought their ship as a prize to 
the navy of Thule.” 

F or the first time the sol- 
diers looked at each other 
and there was laughter. I drew 
the Great Blade and flashed it 
between Sha’ and Sha’. The 
laughter abruptly ceased. The 
Lords of Thule already carry 
such blades and these soldiers 
now believed me. 

At five paces the captain or- 



dered a line thrown to me, and 
I made it fast. I stepped to the 
deck of the fighter of Thule and 
prickles of fear were on my 
back. The captain studied my 
face, and he recognized me. 

He exclaimed “Master!” 

I saw the many implications of 
this meeting storm across his rug- 
ged face. 

A soldier whispered, “I’ll 
swear on the Sea Floor, it is the 
builder of the Tower.” 

All motion about me ceased 
and there was silence in which 
no man heard more loudly than 
I that anguished cry, Give him 
one hundred lashes. Nail him to 
a plank, and put him adrift at 
sea. 

The captain could only stare 
at me. I had painted for one of 
the inner walls of his tower a 
scene that had since become fa- 
mous. It depicts the legend of 
Namora. Startled from her bed 
of pearls, the chaste goddess 
fights off the advances of Ti, 
the sea serpent. With this paint- 
ing I had at last achieved such 
depiction of the human body 
that all who saw it stood in awe. 
None of the paintings I had done 
on Parsos or Hahn equaled it. 
This captain had been proud of 
his association with me. 

I saw on his face that the lords 
of Thule would be dismayed at 
my return. In their eyes I had 
not done such a wrong. In the 



130 



GALAXY 



last great raid of the Ice Island- 
ers my parents had been killed. 
All their servants, and I their 
son, had been taken as slaves. It 
was not, to the lords of Thule, a 
discredit to me that subsequent- 
ly a false king had assumed the 
Tower of my home isle and had 
dissolved the lordship of my fa- 
ther. 

If then, I was a lord by desert, 
it was no great crime to have 
loved the youngest of the six 
daughters of their king. Unpoli- 
tic behavior, no doubt. But to be 
nailed to a plank! The thought 
is abhorrent even beyond its 
reality because of the belief that 
such cursed planks drift into the 
desert seas and remain afloat. 

•nphe Lord Captain who now 
stared into my face knew 
that my sentence was irrational. 
If the king had had a son, if one 
of his older daughters had had 
a son, I would today be mar- 
ried into the king’s family. For 
in that circumstance a son of 
pure Thulian blood would not 
have been required of the 
youngest princess, to be later, 
King of Thule. In that circum- 
stance my impropriety would 
have led, not to her ineligibil- 
ity for royal marriage, but to our 
early marriage. 

The captain took me aside. 
“Master, why have you brought 
this trial to me? I must take you 

A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



to your death. Don’t you wish 
to stand on the Sea Floor? Must 
you decay here at the surface?” 

“You think he cannot forgive 
me?” 

“He will go through with it 
because he commanded it. What 
in the name of Sha’charn has 
brought you here?” 

“A false pretender holds the 
Tower of my home isle. I have 
come for soldiers to retake it.” 

“Why didn’t you go to Parsos 
which is drifting close to you 
now?” 

The sails of the fighter had 
been rehoisted and the light 
breeze heeled us away from the 
bandit ship which was returned 
with soldiers to pick up the 
raft-load of its former crewmen. 

I explained to the captain why 
I could not use soldiers from 
Parsos. 

The people of my homeland 
have an outlandish reputation 
for unpredictable and romantic 
action. The Lords of Thule and 
Hahn, the great powers that 
forced back the Ice Islanders, 
sometimes look down their 
noses at our violent political his- 
tory. They call us “teri che” 
which is to say, “wild ones”. 

This captain now hurt my 
heart, as if he had slapped my 
face. He shook his head with a 
grim smile and said, “Teri che.” 
Then, staring into my face un- 
comprehendingly, he went on, 

131 



“You will not live to retake 
your Tower, let alone to carry 
out a scheme for binding islands 
together. You are going to be a 
dead patriot.” 

Then, without meaning to, he 
hurt me even deeper. “Thule 
owes you better than a plank. I 
promise that after your death, I 
will raise an invasion and 
straighten out your politics at 
home. I will place your great 
prince in his Tower.” 

With his contemptuous tone 
about our prince, which we 
agreed on, he expressed his eval- 
uation of my plan to bind the 
islands, which he understood no 
better than my own people. 

Neither by the rude nor by 
the sophisticated was my plan 
understood. 

VI 

T ater, when we marched along 
' a country road toward the 
city, with soldiers ahead and 
to the rear of us, I found there 
was one thing that rude people 
everywhere understood of me. 

The news of my capture had 
run ahead. Tillers came down 
the neat rows of their fields to 
• stand beside the road. They 
snickered and nudged each oth- 
er and sometimes one could hear 
a suggestion that I must have a 
finer “tower” even than the king. 
The analogy had the inspired 



hurtfulness of the rude, and the 
hurt lay in the heart of the 
proud old man to whom I was 
being taken. 

Twice soldiers had to dash to 
the side of the road and knock 
heads with their javelin butts. I 
began to understand why the 
King of Thule could not forgive 
me. 

The flesh of my back crawled, 
and I perspired more than the 
day called for. The captain some- 
times looked at me, but he said 
no more. 

After the long walk through 
the country came the city. First, 
the two-level towers of the poor 
on their awkward stilts; then 
towers of more levels, and towers 
that reared gorgeous mosaics of 
ivory and wood and pearl, 
seven and nine levels into the 
blue and gold sunlight. These 
rich men were indeed raised re- 
splendently above the monotony 
of the sea. 

Here in these nacreous ’ers 
lived the charming people whose 
eyes I had dazzled with carvings 
and paintings, and whose minds 
I had thrilled with theories. 
Now they turned from me in 
grief. I felt at my back the 
northwind of fear. 

Then came the great square of 
Thule which is actually paved 
from one end to the other with 
stone. All of this stone was raid- 
ed two centuries ago from the 



132 



GALAXY 



great pile* in the northern Ice 
Islands, and it is said that in 
the years of those raids 1,000 
Thulians died — and twice that 
many Ice Islanders. 

Here in this great sunlit 
square they would nail me to 
the plank. As sharply and dryly 
as the breaking of small sticks 
would sound the stone mallet on 
the pegs. The sound of the mal- 
let would spank along the dec- 
orated tower walls and die away, 
and they would lift the plank to 
carry it out to sea. The crowd 
in the square would melt away, 
fearful and brooding because an- 
other vengeful “shee-shoon”, 
which is to say, condemned spirit, 
would be loose upon the sea. 

So I would drift into deserts 
with the suns banging my eyes 
while my home isle drifted in 
poverty. 

The work of my own hand 
was the final blow to my hopes. 
How awesome was this dwell- 
ing! At the far end of the square 
it soared fourteen levels into the 
sky. Its grounds were walled 
with stone to twice the height of 
a man. Inside there, in the spa- 
cious gardens, rose four more 
towers, and even these were nine 
levels high. 

All this had been done to my 
design, and now I trembled be- 
fore it 

They did not take me to him. 
Instead, he came to me. He came 



in the night to the jail. I saw 
with pain that he was now an 
old man, as if something had 
broken in him and loosed the 
tensions of his haughty bearing. 
He stood before me and studied 
my fear. 

He stood that way while they 
drew my hands up to the low 
ceiling in a noose and bound 
my feet to a shackle in the floor. 
Then he spoke and I learned 
that the voice was still his. 

He asked softly, “How could 
you have done this to me? To 
me, who loved you and reward- 
ed you and gloried in your 
work? How could you have tak- 
en from me my last hope?” 

I could say nothing. Then, in 
the tiny, windowless jail, his ter- 
rible pride shrieked, “How could 
you have made a laughing stock 
of me?” 

He tore the lash from the 
great brute beside him, and he 
smashed it into my face. Repeat- 
ing over and over, “How could 
you have made a laughing stock 
of me?’ he lashed my face and 
chest and groin, and I tasted 
what was to come. 

As a boy I was tortured by the 
Ice Islanders. I do not bear tor- 
ture well. I moaned when his 
weak flailing warned me of what 
the big jailer could do. When he 
had exhausted himself, he sat 
down on the damp floor and 
beat feebly with his fists. 



134 



GALAXY 



The jailer took up the lash. 
He grinned pleasantly to me 
and asked politely, “How would 
you like it, Master? Slow, or 
fast.” 

“No,” I shouted. “No, Highest 
One, don’t let him do this!” 

But the poor old man was 
deaf to everything except his 
own misery and shame. 

XT/hen I was again con- 
^ * scious, and the lights had 
stopped bursting in my eyes, the 
jailer was seated on a bench, 
resting. The fat of his chest 
heaved, and he ran a stubby 
hand across it to wipe away his 
sweat. 

The king had risen from the 
floor. His silks were dirty and 
disheveled. “How many have you 
given him?”, he asked the jail- 
er, hoarsely. 

“Barely thirty, Highest One.” 

Through the swimming of the 
room, I saw the jailer rise and 
start toward me, and I screamed. 

“Let him down. Be gentle 
with him.” 

I allowed myself to sink to the 
calm Sea Floor. 

He had me taken to his own 
apartments, in the highest levels 
of the Tower. In silence, he came 
every day and washed my 
wounds and dressed them. 

He came several times each 
day and repeated this care in si- 
lence so that I wept when I was 



alone for what I had done to 
him. 

On the third day he spoke. 

“The Lord Captain who took 
you has explained the reason 
you have come. It is good poli- 
tics for the rock-latched islands 
like Thule and Hahn, to 
strengthen the freely floating 
islands. You may have the sol- 
diers. Whatever you need.” 
With that he rose to leave. 

Then at the door he turned, 
the whisper of his robes as loud 
as the shouting of a thousand 
soldiers. 

“Be very clear about this. I do 
not waste a soldier for the sake 
of ten che. I believe your plan 
to bind those three little islands 
into one rich, strong island will 
work. By aiding that plan, I do 
one more little thing to keep 
back the Ice Islanders and keep 
down the sea bandits. It strength- 
ens Thule.” 

His gray eyes lingered mo- 
mentarily as he turned and left 
me. 

A gain and again, while the 
captain and I worked on the 
plans for storming my home isle, 
the king’s words stung me. “Z do 
not waste a soldier for the sake 
of teri che.” 

Again and again, this stinging 
drove my mind to the pool in 
the gardens of the Tower of my 
homeland. It is a hole into the 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



135 



sea for decorative purposes and 
salt-lilies are grown there. On 
many islands there is such a pool 
in the gardens of the Tower. 

I have often thought. “Behind 
all the guards at the walls of the 
Tower, there is a way in.” 

When the captain and I had 
completed our plans and had de- 
cided to embark in another 
four days, suddenly it came to 
me. “A craft can be built to go 
under the island and come up in 
the pool.” 

Such a surprise would save 
many soldiers of Thule, and 
many of my teri che. 

In one moment things fell in- 
to place from countless observa- 
tions and sources. How had I 
built and caulked the plumb- 
ing in the Great Tower of 
Thule? How does a fish roll in 
the water? How strong is the 
thickest of the round lenses of 
the glass of Hahn? 

For two days, hardly taking 
time to eat or sleep, I stayed in 
my apartment drawing plans for 
such a craft. Once I went to the 
winery in the country and in- 
spected two of the great hogs- 
heads for storage which are 
large enough for a man to stand 
in. 

The two giant hogsheads 
could be spliced together with 
mores than enough strength and 
more room inside than would be 
needed by two men. This would 



be too buoyant, and so stone 
would have to line the bottom of 
the craft until it was almost 
ready to sink. Now, there would 
have to be a way to take on 
weight for sinking and get rid 
of it for coming back to the sur- 
face. So I would have a barrel 
braced on the floor midship 
and a pipe with a cock in that 
would let water into it so that 
the craft would sink. 

From the iron that flows near 
their island, the Hahnese have 
contrived a pump which a man 
may work by a handle and 
force water up a height. I would 
have to arrange one of these 
pumps so that water could be 
forced from the barrel back in- 
to the sea, and thus we would 
come again to the surface. 

I saw that when the craft sank 
I would go on sinking, however 
slowly, unless a means other 
than emptying the barrels were 
used to stop this motion. So I 
would have structures along the 
sides like the fins of a fish that 
would maintain a level of de- 
scent as long as the craft was 
moving forward. 

It was in moving the craft for- 
ward that I had trouble. There 
are no winds under the sea, and 
to paddle my hogsheads seemed 
to me out of the question. A 
boat can be moved forward by 
thrashing the rudder in a crude 
duplication of the fish tail. But 



136 



GALAXY 



I saw that no rudder I might de- 
sign would move us from the 
edge of my home isle to the pool 
in the gardens of the Tower be- 
fore the two or three occupants 
of the hogsheads fell from ex- 
haustion. 

I had to ask the captain for a 
delay in the embarkation. Na- 
urally he was willing to wait 
for any plan that would spare 
his men. So I went back to my 
apartment and the problem of 
propulsion. 

The more I thought about the 
clumsy action of a rudder, the 
more exasperated I became. 
There was something in this ac- 
tion that escaped me. 

It was evening again, and I 
was utterly exhausted. I took a 
bottle of spirits from the cabinet 
and poured a drink. I sipped it 
while I stared at all the draw- 
ings I had made for propelling 
mechanisms. I poured another, 
large drink and went to the win- 
dows. 

I do not deny that in my go- 
ings and comings about the 
Tower, I had never ceased to 
watch for the princess. I had not 
seen her and I did not see her 
now as my eyes searched the 
lawns and courts between the 
towers. But I longed deeply to 
see her, and suddenly I was 
drunk and very tired. 

I awakened in the night with 
a headache. I rolled over in the 



luxurious bed and buried my 
face, and abruptly, there was the 
idea for the propulsion. 

The rudder need not move like 
the tail of a fish, it need not act 
like any living thing. It could be 
a spinning rudder of two blades 
tilted oppositely on their axis. 
This could be turned by a shaft 
extending into the craft. The 
shaft should have two cranks in 
it so that two men could turn at 
once. 

Now, before noon, I finished 
all the drawings for my craft, 
and I sent a servant to the king. 
He invited me to lunch on his 
balcony, and there I showed 
him the drawings for this mar- 
velous boat that would take 
men under the sea. 

By the end of our lunch he 
had become as excited as I. Then 
suddenly, we were both sad- 
dened that the old days were 
gone when we had planned to- 
gether like this. 

He said simply, “Have the 
Lord Captain procure craftsmen 
and proceed at once to build it.” 

I was dismissed. He shook his 
head to prevent me from speak- 
ing. 

VII 

VT7e built the undersea craft 
on one of the navy wharfs. 
In barely seven days we were 
ready for a trial. 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



137 



We let the boat into water. I 
had added a barrel to the top of 
the structure through which the 
occupants could enter and leave. 
In the front of this superstruc- 
ture I had had them caulk a 
thick lens of the glass of Hahn 
so that I could look forward un- 
der water. 

I had somehow miscalculated 
the buoyancy and we had to add 
some stone to the floor. Finally, 
when I and the soldier who 
would go with me were both 
aboard, little more than the su- 
perstructure remained above 
water. 

The poor soldier was shaking 
with fright but determined to 
die for Thule. I climbed the 
rungs back up into the super- 
structure and told the Lord Cap- 
tain to pole us away from the 
wharf. 

A luxurious litter appeared 
and came toward us. 

I knew at once that it was the 
king. He could not stay away 
from this trial. I waited, stand- 
ing in a barrel in the sea. I 
hoped for some warning or some 
encouragement from him. He 
simply motioned the Lord Cap- 
tain and soldiers to be at ease. 
Then he waved to me in silence 
and stood waiting. 

IJHe had placed one of the 
* ' fighters of Thule at a good 
distance from shore. I took one 

138 



last sighting on the fighter to 
make sure we were pointing to- 
ward it. Then, hurriedly, I 
closed and tightened the hatch 
in the top of the barrel and de- 
cended into the dark to hear 
the soldier’s teeth chattering. 

I said, “Soldier, are you stand- 
ing by the crank?” 

He gulped hard. “Yes, Mas- 
ter.” 

“Stay there. Start crank- 
ing when I tell you.” 

I fumbled in the dark and 
opened the cock of the barrel. 
Through the shallow, fast 
breathing of the soldier, I could 
hear water running into the bar- 
rel. Back at the window I caught 
a blurred glimpse of the fighter 
just before the sea lapped over 
the glass. Then I was looking at 
the cool, green of underwater 
and fishes turning past. My 
heart beat widly. I let the light 
deepen a little and hurried back 
to close the cock, barking my 
shins on the gracings for the 
barrel. 

“Now, soldier, start to crank!” 

I joined my effort to his at my 
part of the shaft. I could hear 
his frightened breathing begin 
to even out with the labor over 
the cranks. I counted up to one 
hundred turns of the shaft while 
it became insufferably hot in 
the hogsheads. 

“Keep cranking with all your 
might,” I gasped and made my 

GALAXY 




way up to the window. 

The green light outside had 
deepened shockingly. For the 
first time I felt fear of the sea. 
I scrambled to the pump and 
worked it for fifteen back-break- 
ing strokes. Then I turned the 
crank with the soldier for twen- 
ty-five turns, and I could re- 
strain my anxiety no longer. I 
went to the window and wiped 
fog from the glass. The light was 
reassuringly brighter. 

“Rest a while, soldier.” 

“What Master?” 

“Rest a while.” 

I kept wiping the fog from 
the window and watching the 
light brighten until I could see 
the swirling of the sea surface. 
Now we needed forward speed 
so the fins along the side would 
keep us from coming all the 
way to the surface. 

“Let’s start cranking again.” 
“Master, are we all right?” 
“We’re all right, soldier, as 
long as we crank.” 

I turned the crank another 
hundred times with the soldier 
and stumbled with exhaustion 
back to the window. The light 
was still all right. I looked hope- 
fully ahead and to the sides, 
knowing we could not be near 
the fighter. 

nphe soldier labored with great 
lung-bursting breaths. I told 
him to rest again, and I tum- 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



139 



ed the crank alone for fifty 
times before I fell to the stones 
of the floor in a daze. The air 
was foul and hot and my lungs 
heaved desperately. 

When I could speak, I com- 
manded, “Turn the crank, sol- 
dier.” 

“Master, I’m dying.” 

“Soldier turn the crank or you 
will die.” 

At first with infinite weari- 
ness and then with dogged ener- 
gy, I could hear him start turn- 
ing the crank. I drug myself up 
to the window. Just as I wiped 
away the fog, I saw something 
off to the left. Then it was no 
longer there. I fell back into 
the hogsheads yelling at the sol- 
dier. “Crank, man! Crank!” 

I banged my head and ripped 
skin from my shins getting to 
the screws that controlled the 
rudder. I turned the rudder the 
wrong way. Then I turned it 
rightly. I made myself count 
slowly to twenty. Then I 
straightened the rudder. 

When I again wiped the fog 
from the window, there was the 
hull of the fighter floating mag- 
ically in a green-yellow sky. 

“Soldier, we’re there. Just a 
little more turning. Turn, sol- 
dier.” 

He turned and I turned with 
him. Then, gasping as if in 
death, I clambered back to the 
window and cried out. 



“Stop, man. Crank the oth- 
er way.” 

For a moment I had thought 
we might pass under the fighter 
and rip off the superstructure, 
but we stopped short of her. 

The soldier had collapsed. I 
thought I would never finish 
pumping the water out of the 
barrel. For a time, after I was 
able to open the hatch, I stood 
and gulped at the air like a dy- 
ing fish. Then I lifted the sol- 
dier and held him while he 
breathed it. 

I climbed out the hatch and 
stood on the forward hogshead 
with water occasionally lapping 
my feet. We had come around 
the fighter and placed her be- 
tween ourselves and the shore. 
All on her deck were at the oth- 
er side watching for us toward 
the island. We drifted to a gen- 
tle bump against the ship. I 
reached up and caught the rail 
and pulled myself slowly to the 
deck. 

I stood there for a moment 
looking at their backs, and then 
I said loudly, “Captain, we are 
here.” 

nphe King of Thule is a com- 
-*■ plex man. When the fighter, 
towing the undersea craft, 
brought us back, he stood before 
me for a time and simply nodd- 
ed his head. Then, no longer 
able to restrain himself, he

threw his arms about me and 

his old hands clapped my shoul- 
ders. 

Still holding me he called to 
all about. “It is a holiday. The is- 
land must celebrate. There will 
be dancing and free wine.” 

As I walked back to the city 
beside his litter, I was not able 
to join in his enthusiasm. For I 
had not anticipated the agonies 
of the underwater trip. I knew 
that the distance out to the fight- 
er had been little more than a 
Jdnrd of the shortest distance 
from the shore of my home isle 
to the pool in its Tower gardens. 

Suddenly I remembered the 
burial pools where we could sur- 
face for good air and rest in the 
protection of a tabooed place. 
Then I became as gay as the 
king was, and when I saw the 
many lords and ladies he invited 
to his apartments in my honor 
and the lavish banquet he had 
served, I knew that I had com- 
pletely won his forgiveness. 
Somehow, having dissolved his 
shame by punishing me, his 
pride had risen again in the 
achievement of the day. 

It was only natural that a 
gnawing hope rose in me. I 
watched every entering guest. I 
longed more than anything else 
in the world to see the princess, 
and I knew that it was impossi- 
ble. He could not bring her 
here. 



'T'wo days later the undersea 
craft was ready on the deck 
of a cargo carrier, and the sol- 
diers and ships were ready for 
the expedition to take the Tower 
of my homeland. I planned to 
take two soldiers to turn the 
crank. This would free me to 
handle the controls during the 
dangerous passage under the is- 
land and to keep careful eye on 
the beacons of daylight that 
would fall through the pools. 

In the late afternoon, the king 
sent a servant for me. The man 
took me down smoothly in one 
of the lifts I had designed for 
the Tower. Then he led me out 
to one of the spacious gardens 
where the king was waiting for 
me. 

“First I must 9how you some- 
thing over here i» the garden 
house.” 

He led me to a small service 
house where the gardeners kept 
their tools. With poorly hidden 
excitement he pushed me 
through the entrance and closed 
the door behind me. 

I was in blackness. Then I 
saw, glowing before me, a gar- 
den hoe and a fork. There was 
also a board with glowing let- 
ters. “Master, you are not the 
only inventor.” . 

What an old fox this king 
was. The door opened and he 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



141 



was standing there as proud as 
Sha’charn. 

“You know the glowing fish 
from the currents of Ohme?” 

I nodded, smiling at his pleas- 
ure. 

“I keep some of those fish in 
the pool over there. The light 
you saw in there is the stuff 
from their glowing stripes. It 
will last over a day, and you will 
have no trouble finding the con- 
trols of your craft.” 

Sha’tule, in sunset, and Sha- 
’charn, yet a little higher, were 
splashing colors across a fluffy 
sky. The towers of the city were 
irridescent with fires. The king 
spoke as if he suggested a stroll. 
He spoke softly, too softly, and 
he laid his hand affectionately on 
my arm. 

“Would you go with me to 
have cakes and wine with the 

princess?” 

The island rocked and I put 
out a hand. 

I was dismayed at what was 
happening to me. I stammered, 
“No. Highest One. That would 
not be right. Do not stir this 
thing.” 

“I think so too, but I can deny 
her nothing. Also, I would give 
you an opportunity to ruin my 
last hope or to vindicate the 
faith I had in you.” 

This last, I did not really hear. 
I was too dazed. I walked the 
way he led me, and the island 

142 



was rocked by a storm deep in 
the sea. 

I n a garden behind one of 
the lesser towers, we came to 
her. She sat at a table decorat- 
ing a fabric. As we approached 
she dropped the needle and her 
hand trembled on the unfinished 
fabric. 

I stared at her hand that was 
telling everything and then at 
her lovely face, and my chest 
ached. I bowed and it felt like I 
was being moved by strings. The 
king asked me to be seated and 
I stood unmindfully until he re- 
peated his request. Then, after I 
was seated, I found that I was 
unable to speak. 

She did speak, but her words 
meant nothing because her voice 
fluttered like a bird in a snare. 
“You have been traveling many 
years, Master.” 

“Pardon me, Princess?” 

“I say ... I say, you have been 
away ... a long time.” 

“Yes, I have been to many is- 
lands, Princess.” 

It seemed, after six years, that 
this was going to be all we had 
to say. 

The king cleared his throat, 
and I was grateful for the com- 
passion in his voice. "The Mas- 
ter has come for soldiers to re- 
take the Tower of his homeland 
from a false pretender.” 

A nurse appeared at the near- 

GALAXY 



by door, and I saw that she had 
with her the boy. 

A thrill gripped me. This was 
my son. 

The nurse saw us and grasped 
frantically to return the lad to 
the rooms. He fled her like a 
deer, bounding over the pretty 
flowers, and threw himself into 
his mother’s arms. She drew his 
head to her breast and kissed 
his forehead and admonished 
him. 

The nurse hurried forward to 
retrieve him, but the king waved 
her away. “Meet the child and 
me in a little while at the en- 
trance to the Great Tower. I will 
go for a walk in the gardens 
with him.” 

Momentarily, I raised my eyes 
from the child to his mother’s 
face, and found her staring at me 
with a great pride and warmth. 
Now, suddenly, we had so much 
to say to each other that we need- 
ed only our eyes to speak with. 

The king rose and extended 
his hand to the child. “Come, my 
son, I will show you the lumin- 
ous fish.” 

I stared at the boy and could 
not take my eyes from him. He 
was as favored as I had heard. 
He had his mother’s famous 
looks. But I saw, too, the shock 
to hair that is my people’s and 
tile thin line of a mouth that is 
mine. 

The king took the child’s 

A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



hand and repeated, “Come, my 
son.” His message was not lost 
on me. For this was his son, the 
only heir he would ever have to 
the Tower of Thule. 

ITThen we were alone, I went 
' ' and sat beside her. The 
light of Sha’charn was soft on 
her lovely head. I saw that 
she was now a woman, even as I 
was no longer a young man. I 
had forgotten the thick beat of 
my heart. 

It was as though the years 
since our parting had stood for 
nothing. I felt my ambitions for 
my homeland melting away like 
a mist. What did I care to bind 
together three ridiculous little 
islands? 

She assured me, between our 
kisses, that her father would 
make her Provincial Queen of 
the island of Lani and allow me 
to marry her as consort ruler if 
I but asked it. In that beguiling 
twilight we both understood that 
this long separation would only 
deepen the delight of Lani. Our 
touch still had the magic of our 
first touch. 

When I had, one last time, 
kissed her eyelids, her cheeks 
and her mouth, I left her and 
went to ask him for this simple 
happiness. 

From behind a low cloud Sha- 
’cham hurled a vast shaft of fire 
at the Great Tower of Thule. I 

143 



was momentarily dazzled. I 
looked up the cascading mosaics 
of fire to where an old man 
waited in the pinnacle of flame. 

Then I awakened and knew 
that Lani would never be. 

When I was admitted to his 
apartments, he stood at a win- 
dow looking out over the wealth 
of his city. He did not turn. 

I waited in silence and pres- 
ently he spoke. “Do not ask of 
me what she wishes. If you ask 
it I will allow it I suffer with 
both of you. But do not ask it of 

„ - f » 

me. 

Her face, in its last look of 
love, appeared before me and 
sharpened painfully till it blot- 
ted out the harsh reality of the 
room. 

I heard his voice repeat, “Do 
not ask it of me.” 

I felt the huge wave of emo- 
tion on which she and I had ris- 
en begin to wash from me. Help- 
lessly I stood there and felt it all 
wash from me until I was left 
empty as a cadaver that had 
somehow struck a pose of adora- 
tion. 

Then her face was gone and I 
was back in the bitter reality of 
the king’s room. From far below, 
the noisy happiness of the eve- 
ning streets was a murmur of 
irony in this high place where 
the last light of Sha’charn lay 
across the rich carpet as might 
a fading, blue shroud. 



He turned to me and gestured 
as if he deprecated that of which 
he spoke. “It is not a law, but 
an expectation, that the King of 
Thule will be Thulian. The peo- 
ple often prefer to see laws brok- 
en, but they do not easily toler- 
ate the disappointment of an ex- 
pectation. 

“I have not much longer to 
live. If I declare the princess to 
be Queen and Interim Ruler the 
people will in time forget you 
and there will be no more than 
ill-mannered heckling when, 
eventually, the prince assumes 
the Tower. But if you marry 
her, if you remain about as a 
constant reminder . .” 

He spread his hands as a con- 
clusion. 

He turned again to the dying 
light from the window, and I 
knew that he saw a marvelous 
vista that I had planned. “I have 
built Thule into the greatest 
power on the sea. I want my son 
to rule what I have built.” 

I went down to the streets. 

I was numb with loss, and 
I understood that, all these 
years, I had existed on the hope 
that eventually he would let us 
live together. Now I found that 
I was going to have to live with 
the bleak certainty that I would 
never again hold her. At the 
thought, my mouth grew dry 
and my palms perspired.

GALAXY 




I walked to the tower of the 
Lord Captain. While I awaited 
him, I looked for the last time 
upon my painting of Namora. 

The captain came from his din- 
ing and looked at me question- 
ingly. 

“We leave tonight. Captain. It 
is the wish of the king.” 

We sailed with nine fighters. 
On the morning of the second 
day out, before Sha’tule had 
raised the first mists from the 
bobbing pumicine beds of my 
home isle, we lowered the un- 
derwater craft into the sea on a 
boom. 

I remember the eerie light in 
the craft that came from the lu- 
minous stuff of the fishes, and I 
remember the soldiers cranking 
desperately in the stagnant air. 
I can still see the great balls of 
light from the burial pools 
where we surfaced and lay out 
on the hogsheads, gasping like 
monstrous fish. 

Most clearly, I remember her 
face weeping in the dark of the 
sea. 

I remember the garden pool of 
the Tower from which I stared 
across the alabaster lilies and 
heard only her voice murmur- 
ing of Lani. The great sound of 
the soldiers of Thule storming 
through the streets of my home- 
land did not still her murmur, 
nor did the screams of the guards 
at the gates as we three came 

A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



from behind and cut them down. 

I suppose a quiet sea will al- 
ways speak to me of Lani. In any 
case, I can recapture her face 
only as it drifts in the dark 
nether world. 

There was a strange thing 
down there ... little fish with 
rods straight up from their heads 
on which hung bell-like lan- 
terns, brightly lighted. They 
came to the window and inspect- 
ed me. Now they always invade 
her memory, like little clowns 
relieving tragedy. 

IX 

I had the prince made king 
that very noon. I was taking 
no more chances with the lords 
of my home island . and it is 
true, as has been claimed, that 
when we brought him from the 
prison to his Tower, he stumbled 
over corpses. He would have to 
do that ! . not once, but twice. 

The officers of Thule laughed. 
It really looked like we were 
placing a dolt in the Tower to 
rule the teri che. 

I gave him time to bathe and 
dine after the rudely rushed cer- 
emony. Then I had myself 
brought to him in his shoddy, 
administrative rooms. As the 
captain of a mercenary foroe 
asks his price for services ren- 
dered, I put before our new king 
the treaty which had already 



been signed by the Kings of Par- 
sos and of Tome. 

He hesitated fretfully. He 
asked many questions. 

I had expected him, in grati- 
tude to me, and out of respect 
for the two great men who had 
already signed the document, 
to grab a pen with haste. 

Instead the lout kept bringing 
up other matters of inconse- 
quence. He interrupted my argu- 
ment with asides to his new 
First Overlord. 

This First Overlord was sim- 
ply one of yesterday’s rebels and 
behaved accordingly. His idea of 
polish was servility. Suddenly he 
glanced at me in fright. 

Then, like a great bell, I re- 
heard what this profound king 
had just asked yesterday’s rebel. 

He had asked, “Where is the 
Chacone they sent to me with 
food while I was in prison?” 

He had asked this as though it 
had just now occurred to him. 

Slowly I lowered the map 
which showed how Tome and 
Parsos could be most efficient- 
ly bound to our island. 

The First Overlord was agitat- 
ed. “She is here, Highest One. 
You asked that . .” 

“Never mind what I asked. 
Bring her.” 

Then he said to me apologet- 
ically, “Ah, Master, forgive these 
interruptions. So many things 
have come up. I know it is not 



146 



GALAXY 



important to you, but I have fal- 
len in love. Desperately! It hap- 
pens she is a Chacone, and I 
must determine to whom she be- 
longs so that I may pay the 
man a fair price. My mind will 
be much more receptive to your 
theories when I have settled this 
affair of the heart.” 

I was suddenly suffering a 
very bad chill and I shiv- 
ered. He took the map from my 
hands and looked at it rather 
gaily and with new interest. 

“Master, this is truly a mo- 
ment in our history. To think 
that my signature will set this 
great plan in motion. You will 
be the hero of our people once 
they realize the greater prosper- 
ity and safety that will be 
theirs . 

The cringing First Overlord 
returned, and with him entered 
my little Chacone. 

Like the broken barking of a 
north wind I tore at him. “Why 
you impudent little . you un- 
grateful . what do you know 
of love?” 

He reddened and yammered. 
“You can’t talk like that to mel 
I’m king now, not your pupil! 
Do you want to stand on a stone? 
What’s this woman to you, any- 
way?” 

“You know very well what she 
is to me. Do you think I’ll bar- 
gain with you? No! I’ll take her 



to Parsos and let you drift to 
Chryo.” 

He stormed out of the room. 
“You’re under detention. Don’t 
forget it You’re under deten- 
tion.” And then at the door, mel- 
odramatically, “Oh, that you 
should have blundered with her 
loveliness before I found her!” 

I could have choked him 
through a thousand deaths I 
went to the wall and beat my fist. 

The little Chacone wept open- 
ly. She came and took my 
bruised hand and kissed it. She 
sobbed, “Oh, Master, my heart 
will break. I have known, Mas- 
ter. The way he looked at me 
from the jail, I knew this would 
happen. But my heart will 
break.” 

I caught the finality in her 
statement, and I took her shoul- 
ders and stared into her face. 
“What makes you think I would 
give you up?” 

“You will have to. I heard 
them talking.” She sobbed and 
indicated the First Overlord 
who still stood at the door. “You 
will not get the plan for the is- 
lands unless you do.” 

S he knew me better than I 
knew myself. She knew I 
would go back to the table and 
stare at the map of three islands 
bound in one. She knew I 
would turn then to stare at her, 
because she did not wait for that 



A MAN OF THE RENAISSANCE 



147 



She left quietly with the First 

Overlord. 

I was appalled at her certain- 
ty of me, and I knew that she 
was right. I knew it with a loath- 
ing that began to crawl in my 
belly like some hideous toad. 

How could I be so dedicated 
to this plan of mine that I would 
destroy in this girl a delicate 
monolith of love? I was a crud- 
er man than the sea bandit who 
had gloried that a thousand 
doves cooed for death. This dove 
would coo forever in some dark 
recess of her heart 

For it is true of the women of 
Chacone that they will kill them- 
selves before they will let a man 
other than their owner come 
near them. But should that own- 
er trade them to another they 
will remain as faithful to the 
master, and will then as savage- 
ly fight off the former owner as 
any other man. For this they 
are trained from childhood in 
some esoteric drilling of the spir- 
it. 

Thus I saw that I was going 
to shut myself from the heart of 
the Chacone, and my anger at 
the king dissolved in the slime 
of my loathing for myself. I 
went to him without the slight- 
est accusation and got his signa- 
ture on the treaty with Torne 
and Parsos. 

I went down from the shabby 
Tower of my homeland and 

148 



walked alone among my people 
which are called teri che. They 
love to drink and there are many 
taverns in the city. I went into 
one of these and ordered spirits. 
Then I also ordered one for the 
amiable sot who instantly joined 
me. 

We drank in silence for a 
while. Indeed, I had nothing to 
say to any man since I had shut 
myself from the tender heart of 
the Chacone. I stared without 
seeing across the talkative room 
and realized that a common 
man could come in here and 
brag with impunity that he had 
slept with the wives of ten lords. 
Then let him brag that he had 
slept with the Chacone of one 
lord, and he would be laughed 
out of the tavern. 

The sot could stand the silence 
no longer. “Now, Master, you’re 
done in, aren’t you? Well, it’s a 
fine thing you managed, getting 
the young prince to his Tower. 
Of course, this business of tying 
us up with Parsos and Tome, I 
don’t see. But I suppose the king 
will decide on that.” 

I stood up to go. He grabbed 
my sleeve. “Now, Master, don’t 
take offense. You ought to get 
to know your homeland. You’ve 
been away too long doing fine 
things for other islands. You 
ought to build a new Tower for 
our . 

I crashed him over the table 

GALAXY 



and into the near wall. 

For a moment the place went 
silent. The wine seller glanced 
from his counter and shook his 
head. 

“Now, Master, it’s a fine thing 
to get drunk and disorderly, but 
let’s not tamper with life and 
limb.” 

I stalked out to the streets, 
and again I was alone 
among my people. I accepted 
their respectful nods and bows 
and understood that I would al- 
ways be separated from them by 
this heart that could love reason 
so deeply and reason away love 
so quickly. 

They were right to fear my 
plan to bind the islands togeth- 
er. The threat of the Ice Island- 
ers was too distant and the 
pinched faces of their children 
too close to weigh against the 
chilling logic of the step. For it 
was a plan bom purely of rea- 
son. It threatened much of the 
spirit in them that was fashioned 
with such disorderly grandeur 



from pride and prejudice and 
the demands of provincialism. 

The street-lighters had set the 
lamps guttering, and the fog 
moved in and turned to pearl be- 
tween them. Somehow the fog 
brought restraint and order and 
a muffling of guilt. As I walked 
the lamps came from the fog in 
a regular cadence and the damp 
planks of the street became an 
orderly path through chaos. 

My enormous crime against 
the Chacone settled into a knot 
of guilt that I was going to have 
to live with. It was a guilt fate 
had made necessary if I was to 
put through the plan . and 
only I would put it through. 

I stopped involuntarily and 
declared to the fog, “I am what 
I am!” Then, glancing about 
me, I walked on. 

There was much to be set 
in motion so that the islands 
could be maneuvered together 
and bound. I would sail tomor- 
row for parsos and get things 
started.

by DAVID R. BUNCH 



lh, love/ Without it, we would 
be like robots. With it, robots 
would be like — well, like what? 



I had just come in from a hard 
day of expediting at the 
power wafer works, and I and 
Dan the Can were getting settl- 
ed for one of our usual event- 
less evenings. I thought. 

I was making myself comfort- 
able in a soof-air chair, one with 
pulsing upholstery that massaged 
buttocks, thighs and back, and 
Dan was standing by on his solid 
square- cornered feet, ready to do 
what I asked. But soon I saw 
he wasn’t his usual self. When 
he changed the set of the chair 
pumps and brought me my so- 
mooso pipe and dozoff shoes I 
noted some strange agitation. 

Always fearing for our rela- 
tionship and wanting to get at 



the truth -bottom of things at 
once I asked, “Something wrong, 
Dan?” 

The lower half of his face 
crashed open like a scoop ready 
to dip. “Yoops,” he said in the 
funny grating way sound always 
came out of him when he was 
upset. “Sompin’ wroong.” 
“What’s wrong then, Dan?” 
“At’s Noona. I bea woontin’ 
her. Ever since I saw her in a 
shoop, yesterday when we strool- 
ed, I bea woontin’ her.” 

“But Dan!” I said, amused 
and alarmed at the same time. 
“Is this Noona someone like 
you?” 

“Noops. She’s a — a — well, I 
guess yoo’d say she’s a goorl.” 



150 



"Sure, of course. But is she — 
well, is she a manufactured ar- 
ticle like you? I mean, Dan, is 
«he mechanical?” 

Dan’s protruding eyes that 
usually glowed a kind of deep 
red when he was feeling right 
changed to purple-blue. With 
those weird beams he looked 
straight at me. He didn’t answer 
my question, but he laughed a 
screechy laugh that sent shivers 
over my body. “Heepa heepa 
heepa,” it sounded. 

“Change the air, Dan!” I 
shouted to reestablish my mas- 
tery. “Set the needle on tired 
man’s roll, the way you know I 
always want it when I’m done 
with businessman’s come-home.” 
He moved sluggishly toward the 
pumps. 

“Brisk, Dan!” I snapped. “Get 
it done.” He moved then with 
speed that rattled the floor. 
“And another thing, Dan. Re- 
member, you and I have been 
tiie perfect relationship for four 
years now. Or, in other words, 
ever since I obtained you from 
the government robot pool and 
started to work at the state 
wafer factory. Through all the 
working day I help make wafers 
to feed your ever-demanding 
power maw; you burn those 
wafers to serve me. Most of the 
human emotions are gone from 
me now. Thank God you never 
had any. We live the great life,

Dan, we function. Why should 
we be cluttering the works with 
this Noona?” 

“Amoosement,” grated Dan. 
“Foon. Loove, too. Besides I 
get loonesome when you’re oop 
at the wafer factoory all day.” 

“Dan!” I almost screamed, so 
surprised was I that he should 
speak so. “Do we not play chess 
or checkers every night, emo- 
tionless games that give our 
steel-sharp minds a chance to 
function? Do I not let you sit 
in the rolling soof-air chair when 
you want to? Though for the life 
of me I don’t know why you, 
with your steel shell, want to. 
Do I not feed you your power 
wafers every day promptly at 
the hour we begin our evening? 
In short, Dan, are you not one 
of the best-cared-for robots in 
town?” 

“Need Noona!” he bellowed 
his reply. “Saw her inna shoop 
yesterday when we strooled. Saw 
that loovely name in raised 
loomps on her chest! Saw her 
firm hoord legs as she bent to 
pick up a sack, yesterday when 
we passed.” 

Then he started making the 
gestures that always brought me 
to my feet. He raised up the 
hinged section of his chest and 
threatened to tear out his heart, 
or, more specifically, the core 
where the power wafers digest- 
ed. “Don’t Dan,” I pleaded, as 



151 



I always did. “That would kill 
you. And I need you — need you 
to give my life a meaning. Or 
more accurately, perhaps, I re- 
quire your presence to make my 
life’s non-meaning bearable. 
Anyway — ” 

“Goo see Noona,” he suggested 
as a kind of ultimatum while 
his steel fingers played with the 
core where the wafers digested. 

“Go see Noona,” I promised, 
not knowing how else to save 
Dan. “Tomorrow. I’ll take off 
work.” 

XT ext morning I arose from my 
* ^ bed that had the roko-pulse 
mattress with the exciting big 
spongy knobs and the tingly- 
lined holes, and I went to see 
Dan who was standing like a 
steel rock, firmly planted beside 
the soof-air chair. I feared that 
he had stood all night there in 
a kind of trance, dreaming metal 
dreams of Noona. 

“Good morning, Dan,” I said, 
checking his power unit. 

He replied, “Goob morning,” 
in a normal voice that made me 
have hopes that we would not 
have to go see his girl friend 
after all. But near the end of 
my breakfast Dan clumped over 
to stand beside me. “Goo see?” 
he asked, letting metal fingers 
idly flicker up and down past 
the place where his chest would 
come open. 



“Yes Dan,” I said, trying to 
smile, “a promise is a promise. 
And of course I want to see 
Noona too.” 

“Goob. I like you.” And he 
caused his fingers to stop mak- 
ing those threats. 

After breakfast I pushed the 
emergency leave button for time 
off from work, and the wafer 
factory sent up a green positive- 
reply flare from the Time-Clock 
building. So we started, led by 
Dan. 

He clumped and rattled along 
almost at a run. He seemed en- 
tirely confident of his direction 
as we went past the power wafer 
plants, the rocket mills and 
many factories where machines 
were being whammed together 
by other machines at terrific 
pace amidst great noise. I did 
not remember going past these 
places yesterday, but Dan did 
not seem to be lost. And when 
we got to the place he sought, 
a shop in the big-number streets 
far from the main part of town, 
I understood. We had been 
there yesterday, but we had 
come by a different route. 

“No woonderin’ by the river 
and woostin’ time this time,” 
said Dan. “I coom today by the 
way I like. Short.” 

We went into a littered place 
where a small man sat by him- 
self. There was something de- 
feated in the way the arms pull- 



152 



GALAXY 



ed the shoulders down and trail- 
ed along the chair sides, dumping 
hands toward the floor. His eyes 
were tragic, and when he spoke 
it was in a voice that hurried 
to have done with what it had 
to say. 

“Hear noise?” 

We heard it, a tappity-rap and 
rattle sound surely locked in a 
closet somewhere, or maybe in 
a basement under us. “When 
you don’t hear it, it’ll be all 
over. Don’t care. Did all I could. 
Wouldn’t listen.” 

“Who? What?” I blurted. 

“Noona,” he cried. “Commit- 
ting suicide. Now. Hammering 
at the locks I put on. She’ll get 
them. Nothing can seem to stop 
the crazy force she’s working 
for now. But I don’t care now.” 

“But why? What?” 

“Something from yesterday. 
Couldn’t understand. Good up 
to then, good functional. Helped 
in this parts store. Helped me 
to prosper. I could buy more 
wafers. She could help me more. 
It was a good arrangement. Then 
yesterday — Something passed 
in the street! 

“Noona!” Dan shrieked. 
“Don’t do it. Here’s loove!” And 
he pounded across to a place in 
the floor and stamped hard on 
the boards. A hidden door sprang 
up. “Don’t!” Dan screamed 
again, and he went to his knees 
to peer into the dark basement 



hole. But the pounding contin- 
ued that sounded like a ham- 
mer tapping a chisel. 

I could see that each tap tore 
at Dan’s power core and almost 
ripped him apart. I felt sorry 
for Dan the Can then, but soon 
I admired him. For once he had 
made his decision he hardly 
wasted a tick. He leaped through 
the air like a dedicated being 
and fell several feet to the ce- 
ment floor of that basement 
hole. I heard him hit, and it 
sounded like dumping scrap at 
tiie mill. I shuddered. 

When the noise of Dan’s de- 
scent cleared away, the tapping 
noise seemed louder for a mo- 
ment. Then it stopped altogeth- 
er. New sounds took its place, 
the smallest of scratchy noises 
down in that basement dark, like 
metal sections being tenderly 
opened on hinges that made al- 
most no noise. Through this 
were the two soft words, Danny 
— Noona, said with a strange 
metallic tenderness. Then they 
came up in each others arms. 

The shopowner could hardly 
believe what he saw. His eyes 
became strangely bright when he 
saw them embrace. , 

Then a petty anger shond 
through the tragedy in them, 
“Worse than death!” he scream- 
ed at Noona, who definitely was 
a girl robot with steel ringlets 
to her head and roundness at 



LET ME CALL HER SWEETCORE 



153 



places. “Worse than if you’d torn 
out your power wafers!” 

“Did doo,” said Noona smil- 
ing a simperish, half -embarrass- 
ed smile out of her square, shin- 
ing face. 

“Did too,” echoed Dan smil- 
ing worse than a bridegroom as 
he raised his chest’s hinged part. 
“We’re soo much a part of each 
oother.” 

Then I saw what they had 
done! They had exchanged pow- 
er cores. 

“Well, whatta ya know!” I 
blurted, and the shopowner yell- 
ed, “Hell’s hinges, this will kill 
them both.” 

XToona of course came home 

^ to live with Dan and me, 
since the shopowner said he no 
longer had any use for her, 
couldn’t trust her now anyway. 

In the days that followed I 
saw how much the man was right 
in predicting disaster for the 
metal lovebirds. Noona and Dan, 
after a few weeks of dallying 
and toying with each other’s 
metal sections and being enam- 
ored with each other’s nearness, 
became, like almost any other 
married pair, bored and snap- 
pish with each other. And I, 
remembering my own less-than- 
successful marriage of many 
years ago, watched with bitter 
amusement as these two, with 
desires horribly mixed, tried to 



dominate one another.. I knew 
something must soon give way. 

It happened one cold March 
evening, about six months after 
the nuptials of Noona and Dan. 

I had called eight times for 
Dan to come change the chair 
massage from businessman’s 
come-home to home-owner’s 
bounce-around, and he hadn’t 
obeyed. I went after him. I met 
him coming from the back beige 
room where he and Noona had 
quarters; his scoop-shaped face 
was twitching so that it shook 
his eyes. “I hate hate hate her!” 
he screamed. “But she has noo 
power power oover anything 
noow. I’m glad.” He was clutch- 
ing his power core in his metal 
fingers, having ripped it from 
Noona’s chest! “I’m my own can 
now!” 

“But Dan,” I cried, “you can’t 
use two! Take Noona back her 
power; then we’ll turn her out 
of this house. We’ll go back to 
our functional living. We’ll be 
through with emotion and this 
silly love-and-stuff.” 

“Noo,” shrieked Dan as he 
ripped her power from his chest. 
He clapped in his own and threw 
hers out the window; it landed 
in a garbage pail. “Damn 
Noona!” he continued, still 
shrieking. “She’s rooned my life. 
But I have looved her — I could 
never stand to see her with an- 
oother.” 



154 



GALAXY 



“Let’s go adjust the massage 
and be like old times,” I sug- 
gested. 

So we did, after awhile. And 
after many weeks Dan seemed 
almost to forget that tragic pe- 
riod when he had been slave to 
Noona and love’s sickening emo- 
tions. Now our days are spent, 
much the same as before Noona, 
among the clean-cut little vic- 
tories of functional living. Eight 
hours I work at the power wafer 
factory so that I may earn 
enough wafers to power Dan the 
can for eight hours of game- 
playing and care in the soof-air 
chair. Eight hours I sleep. And 
Noona just lies in the back beige 
room, cold, alone, without any 
power, waiting for some master 
tinkerer in robots I suppose to 
come and repair her. Dan and 



I hardly ever mention her name 
as we grow quietly older, so 
assured, so unbothered, coolly 
living our never changing func- 
tional routine. 

But sometimes when the moon 
shines down a certain way on 
the wafer factory roofs and there 
is a soft touch of valentine wea- 
ther in a pink and peaceful time, 
and steel lovers sing to their 
steel ladies in the big entertain- 
ment panels of the wall, I see 
Dan get that funny look. Then 
I say, “Dan, you’ve been work- 
ing too hard again, Dan; time 
for your vacation again, Dan.” 
And before he can react to stop 
me I rush over to jerk out his 
power wafers — to save him 
from — well, to save him from 
his foolish foolish self.

FORECAST 

Next issue brings long stories by Cordwainer Smith, J. T. McIntosh and 
James H. Schmitz, as well as shorts by — well, well see how many we can 
fit in. We think it will be a rather outstanding issue, in terms of its fiction 
content. But what we want to tell you about right now is not the fiction 
but the features. 

Feature one: The next Willy Ley column 'is produced at the suggestion 
and special request of Betsy Curtis, herself a first-rate writer. "What," she 
asked us recently, "are all those different kinds of things called orreries 
that I see in museums and shops?" We fielded the question neatly by 
passing it on to Willy; and the result is his upcoming column, which will 
tell you rather more than you thought there was to know about orreries 
(otherwise known as the poor man's planetarium) and their successor 
devices for portraying planetary orbits. 

Feature two: Next issue we bring back our regular book review column, 
an event which we have postponed until we were able to find the reviewer 
we liked best. We've got him now. His name is Algis Budrys.

Men were dead, but they had left 
mourners behind . determined 



to track down 



I 

T Tate spewed across the gal- 

-*• axy in a high crusade. Metal 
ships leaped from world to 
world and hurtled across space 
to farther and farther stars. 
Planets surrendered their ores 
to sky-reaching cities, built 
around fortress temples and 
supported by vast networks of 
technology. Then more ships 
were spawned, armed with in- 
credible weapons, and sent forth 
in the eternal search for an ene- 
my. 

In the teeming cities and 
aboard the questing ships, soul- 
wrenching music was composed, 
epic fiction and supernal poetry 
wfere written, and great paint- 
ings and sculpture were devel- 
oped, to be forgotten as later 
and nobler work was done. Sci- 
ence strove for the ultimate lim- 



their murderers I 



it of understanding, fought 
against that limit, and surged 
past it to limitless possibilities. 

But behind all the arts and 
sciences lay the drive of reli- 
gion. And the religion was one of 
ancient anger and dedicat- 
ed hate. 

The ships filled the galaxy un- 
til every world was conquered. 
For a time they hesitated, pre- 
paring for the great leap out- 
ward. Then the armadas sailed 
again, across thousands and mil- 
lions of light-years toward the 
beckoning galaxies beyond. 

With each ship went the holy 
image of their faith and the un- 
sated and insatiable hunger of 
their hate . 

II 

Hphe cat-track labored up the 
rough road over the crater 



156 



wall, topped the last rise and be- 
gan humming its way down into 
Aristarchus. As it dipped 
into the ink black of its own 
shadow from the sun behind, its 
headlights flashed on. Around 
it, the jagged rocky walls scintil- 
lated in a riot of reflected colors 
from crystal fractures that had 
never been dulled by wind or 
rain. 

Inside the cab, the driver’s 
seat groaned protestingly at the 
robot’s weight as Sam shifted his 
six hundred terrestrial pounds 
forward. Coming home was al- 
ways a good time. He switched 
lenses in his eyes and began 
scanning the crater floor for the 
first sight of the Lunar Base 
Dome, though he knew it was 
still hidden around a twist of 
the trail. 

“You don’t have to be quite so 
all-fired anxious to get back, 
Sam,” Hal Norman complained. 
But the little selenologist was al- 
so gazing forward eagerly. “You 
might show some appreciation 
for the time I’ve spent answer- 
ing your fool questions and try- 
ing to pound sense into your tin 
head. Anybody’d think you 
didn’t like my company,” he 
pouted humorously. 

Sam made the sound of a hu- 
man chuckle as he had taught 
himself to acknowledge all the 
verbal nonsense men called hu- 
mor. But truth compelled him to 



answer seriously. “I like your 
company very much, Hal.” 

He had always liked the com- 
pany of the men he’d met on 
Earth or during his many years 
on the Moon. Humans, he had 
decided long ago, were wonder- 
ful. He had enjoyed the long 
field trip with Hal Norman 
while they collected data from 
the automatic recorders scat- 
tered over the lunar surface. But 
it would still be good to get back 
to the dome, where the men had 
given him the unique privilege 
of joining them. There he could 
listen to the often inexplicable 
but always fascinating conversa- 
tion of forty men. And there, 
perhaps, he could join them in 
their singing. 

Music and reading were the 
chief recreations of the men 
here. There were thousands of 
microbooks in the dome library, 
brought in a few at a time by 
many men over the long years. 
They were one of the few taboos. 
It was against orders for Sam to 
read any of them, and a man 
had once told him that it was to 
save him from unnecessary con- 
fusion. But the collection of mu- 
sic was not forbidden, and he 
was often permitted to join in 
their singing. All the robots had 
perfect pitch, of course. But 
only Sam had learned to sing ac- 
ceptably enough to win a place 
in the dome. 



TO AVENGE MAN 



157 



In anticipation, he began 
humming a chanty about the sea 
he had never seen. The cat-track 
hummed downward between the 
walls of the road that had been 
crudely bulldozed from the rub- 
ble of the crater. Then they 
broke out into the open, and he 
could see the dome and the ter- 
ritory around it 

Hal grunted in surprise. 
“That’s odd. I hoped the supply 
rocket would be in. But what 
are those three ships doing 
here?” 

Sam cut off the headlights and 
switched back to wide-angle 
lenses. Now most of the crater 
was visible, until it vanished 
against the horizon, giving place 
to the blackness of the sky and 
the myriad colored pinpoints of 
the stars. Ahead lay the low 
dome that roofed the Base, with 
its biphase microwave antenna 
tracking the manned space plat- 
form that circled Earth. Half a 
mile beyond it stood three ships, 
bulky with exposed tanks and 
each carrying a huge passenger 
globe encased in bracing girders. 
They didn’t look like supply 
rockets. 

Sam’s eyes swept across the 
crater floor, almost to the hori- 
zon. There he could make out 
the crumpled wreck of an early 
ship, still surrounded by the 
supply capsules that had been 
sent on automatic control to 

158 



keep the stranded crew alive un- 
til rescue could be sent. The 
three ships bore a striking re- 
semblance to the one that had 
crashed. The only other such 
ships were those used in the 
third expedition. But they had 
been parked in orbit around 
Earth after the end of the third 
expedition fifty years ago. Once 
the Base was established, their 
capacity had no longer been 
needed, and they were inefficient 
for routine supply shipment and 
the rotation of the men stationed 
here. 

T)efore he could comment 
on the ships, the buzzer 
sounded, indicating that Base 
had spotted the cat-track. Sam 
flipped the switch and acknowl- 
edged the call. 

“Hi, Sam.” It was the voice of 
Dr. Robert Smithers, the leader 
of Lunar Base. “Butt out, will 
you? I want to talk to Hal.” 

Sam could have tuned in on 
the communication frequency 
with his own receptors, since 
the signal was strong enough at 
this distance. But he obeyed the 
order to avoid listening as Hal 
reached for the handset. There 
was no way to detune his audio 
receptors, however. 

He heard Hal’s greeting. 
Then there was silence for at 
least a minute. 

Hal’s face was shocked and 

GALAXY 



serious when he finally spoke 
again. “But that’s damned non- 
sense, Chief! Earth got over such 
insanity half a century ago. 
There hasn’t been a sign of . 
Yes, sir . All right, sir. Thanks 
for not taking off without me.” 
He hung up the handset, shak- 
ing his head. When he faced 
Sam, his expression was unread- 
able. “Full speed, Sam.” 

“There’s trouble,” Sam 
guessed. He threw the cat-track 
into its top speed of thirty miles 
an hour, fighting and straining 
with the controls. Only a robot 
could manage the tricky ma- 
chine at such a rate over the 
crude road, and it required his 
full attention. 

Hal’s voice was strange and 
harsh. “We’re being sent back to 
Earth. Big trouble, Sam. But 
what can you know of war and 
rumors of war?” 

“War was a dangerous form of 
political insanity, outlawed at 
the conference of 1983,” Sam 
quoted from a speech that had 
come over the radio. “Human 
warfare has now become un- 
thinkable.” 

“Yeah. Human war.” Hal 
made a rough sound in his 
throat. “But not cruel and inhu- 
man war, it seems . Oh, hell. 
Stop looking so gloomy; it’s not 
your problem.” 

Sam decided against chuck- 
ling this time, though reference 



to his set, unsmiling expression 
was usually meant to be a form 
of humor. He filed the puzzling 
words away in his permanent 
memory for later consideration. 

The terminator was rushing 
across the lunar surface. It 
would soon be night. More than 
half of the near crater was al- 
ready hidden in blackness, 
though sunlight was still reach- 
ing the Base, and the territory 
beyond was in glaring white 
light. But the undiffused sha- 
dows stretched long behind ev- 
ery projection in the road. See- 
ing was hard as they neared the 
dome, and all Sam’s attention 
had to be directed to his driving. 
Behind him, he heard Hal get- 
ting into the moonsuit to leave 
the cab. 

Sam brought the cat-track to a 
halt to let Hal out at the en- 
trance to the sealed un- 
derground hemisphere of lunar 
rock that was the true dome — 
The light upper structure was 
simply a shield against the heat 
of the sun. He drove the ma- 
chine under that and shut off 
the motor. 

As he emerged from the air- 
lock, air gushed out of small ca- 
vities of his body and made a 
haze of glittering crystals that 
fell slowly to the surface. But he 
felt no discomfort. There was 
only the faint click as a pressure 
sensitive piezzo-electric switch 



TO AVENGE MAN 



159 



activated a relay inside his torso. 
That switch was designed as an 
emergency measure, to turn his 
power on if there should be a 
puncture of the dome wh:?e he 
was inactivated, and now it 
merely indicated the pressure 
drop. Maybe one of the reasons 
the men liked having him in- 
side was the existence of that 
switch, since it could save their 
lives — though he hoped there 
were other explanations. There 
had been no room in the Mark 
Three robots for such devices. 

He saw some of the Mark 
Threes waiting just beyond the 
entrance as he approached. 
There were tracks in the lunar 
dust leading to the space ships, 
but whatever ferrying they had 
done was obviously finished, and 
they were merely standing in 
readiness. They were totally un- 
like him. 

S am bulked over the tiny 
black robots. One of them, 
directly in his path, slipped un- 
der his raised arm to make room 
for him, moving with a light 
gracefulness that he couldn’t ap- 
proximate. He was bulky and 
mechanical, designed only for 
fuhction, in the early days when 
men needed help on the Moon. 
The Mark Threes were almost 
childlike, under their dark ena- 
mel, and their size and weight 
had been pared down to less 



than that of a man. There had' 
been thirty of the model origin- 
ally, but accidents had left only 
a few more than twenty. And of 
the original Mark Ones, only 
Sam was still functioning. 

“When dc we leave?” he 
called to one of the little robots 
over the radio circuit. 

The black head turned slowly 
toward him. “We do not know. 
The men did not tell us.” 

“Didn’t you ask them?” he 
called. But he had no need of 
their denial. They had not been 
told to ask. 

They were still unformed, less 
than five years old, and their 
thoughts were tied to the educa- 
tion given by the computers in 
the creche. They lacked more 
than twenty years of his intimate 
association with men. But some- 
times he wondered whether they 
would ever learn enough, or 
whether they had been too 
strongly repressed in training. 
Men were afraid of robots back 
on Earth, as Hal Norman had 
once told him, which was why 
they were still being used only 
on the Moon. 

He turned away from them 
and went down the entrance to 
the inner dome. The entrance 
led to the great community 
room, and the men were all ga- 
thered there, wearing moon- 
suits. They were arguing with 
Hal as he began emerging from 



160 



GALAXY 



NX 




TO AVENGE MAN 



the lock, but at sight of Sam the 
words were cut off. He stared 
about in the silence, feeling sud- 
denly awkward. 

“Hello, Sam,” Dr. Smithers 
said finally. He was a tall, spare 
man of barely thirty, but seven 
years of responsibility here had 
etched deep lines into his face 
and put gray in his mustache, 
though his other hair was still 
jet black. “All right, Hal. Your 
things are on the ship. I cut it 
fine waiting for you, so we’re 
leaving at once. No more argu- 
ments. Get out there!” 

“Go to hell!” Hal told him. “I 
don’t desert my friends.” 

Other men began moving out. 
Sam stepped aside to let them 
pass, but they seemed to avoid 
looking at him. 

Smithers sighed wearily. 
“Hal, I can’t argue this with 
you. You’ll go if I have to chain 
you. Do you think I like this? 
But we’re under military orders 
now. They’re going crazy back 
there. They didn’t find out about 
the expected attack until a week 
ago, as near as I can learn, but 
they’ve already canceled space. 
Damn it, I can’t take him! We’re 
at the ragged limit of available 
lift now, and he represents six 
hundred pounds of mass — more 
than four of the others,” he raised 
his arms slightly. 

Hal gestured sharply toward 
the outside. “Then leave four of 



those behind. He’s worth more 
than the whole lot of them.” 

“Yeah. He is. But my orders 
specify that all men and the 
maximum possible number of 
robots must be returned.” Smith- 
ers twisted his lips savagely and 
suddenly turned to face the ro- 
bot. “Sam, I’ll give it to you 
straight. I can’t take you with 
us. We have to leave you here 
alone. I’m sorry, but that’s how 
it has to be.” 

“You won’t be alone, Sam,” 
Hal Norman said. “I’m staying.” 

Sam stood silently for a mo- 
ment, letting it register. His cir- 
cuits found it hard to integrate. 
He had never thought of being 
separated from these men who 
had been his life. Going back to 
Earth had been easy to accept; 
he’d gone back there once be- 
fore. Little hopes and future-pic- 
tures he hadn’t known were in 
his mind began to appear. 

But with those came memor- 
ies of Hal Norman’s expressed 
hopes and dreams. The man had 
showed Sam a picture of his fu- 
ture wife and tried to describe 
all that such a creature meant to 
a man. He’d spoken of green 
fields and the sea. He’d raved 
about Earth too often during the 
days they were together. 

Sam moved forward toward 
Hal. The man saw him coming 
and began to back away, but he 
was no match for the robot. Sam 



162

held his arms and closed the 
moonsuit, then gathered the 
man up carefully. Hal was strug- 
gling, but it did no good against 
Sam’s determination. 

“All right, Dr. Smithers. We 
can go now,” Sam told the Chief. 

r T''hey were the last to leave 
the dome. The little black 
robots were already marching 
across the surface, with the men 
straggling along behind them. 
Smithers fell into step with Sam, 
moving as if the burden was on 
his back instead of in the arms 
of the robot. Hal had ceased 
struggling. He lay outwardly 
quiet; but through the suit, 
Sam’s body receptors picked up 
sounds that he had heard only 
twice before on occasions he 
tried not to remember. They 
were the sounds of a man trying 
to control his weeping. 

Half way to the ships, faint 
words came over the radio. “Put 
me down, Sam. I’ll go quietly.” 

Sam obeyed, and the three 
moved on together. Smithers’ 
hand touched Sam’s shoulder, 
and the man’s words came 
through his suit. “Thanks, Sam. 
Handling Hal was a favor I no 
longer had the right to ask erf 
you. Well, it looks as if you’re 
going to have a lot of time to 
kill. And we . .” 

He didn’t finish the thought. 
Sam mulled over the words he 



could understand, and even they 
made no sense. With the men all 
gone, there would be no spare 
time. There would be more than 
he could possibly find time to 
accomplish. The great solar ob- 
servatory across the crater would 
need tending, the selenographs 
would have to be checked and 
at least the routine reports from 
all instruments would have to be 
sent off weekly. He should have 
had hours of instructions, but 
now it looked as if there would 
be no time for more than hasty 
orders. 

By the time the three reached 
the nearest ship, the other men 
and the little robots were all 
aboard. The Chief motioned Hal 
up the ramp. For a moment the 
younger man hesitated. He 
turned toward Sam, started to 
make a motion, and then swung 
away and dashed into the ship, 
his shoulders shaking convul- 
sively. 

Smithers still stood after the 
other had disappeared. The ra- 
dio brought the sound of a sigh, 
before the man moved. But there 
were no words. 

“You haven’t given me my or- 
ders,” Sam reminded him. 

Smithers shook his head, as if 
coming out of some deeper 
thoughts ef his own. His lips 
twitched into what might have 
been a smile. “No, Sam. There 
are no orders. All orders, past. 



TO AVENGE MAN

present or future — all are can- 
celed. There is no more work. 
Space is finished!” 

He put his foot on the ramp 
and turned partly away from 
Sam. Then abruptly he swung 
back. 

“Good-by, Sam,” he said thick- 
ly. His right hand lifted in a 
brief gesture. “Don’t forget the 

books!” 

A moment later, he was 
through the entrance to the ship. 
The ramp was drawn in after 
him, and the great outer seal of 
the rocket ship began to close. 

Ill 

Cam ran back to the en- 
^ trance to the dome, to avoid 
the blast. As he ran, he realized 
slowly the meaning of what 
Smithers had said. 

No orders! There hadn’t even 
been orders left for him to come 
back here, back to the place men 
had left. Yet his feet went on 
moving, as if acting on some 
strange orders of their own. 

The edge of darkness had 
touched the dome now, leaving 
the rocket standing in the last 
light as he turned back. He 
Watched the takeoff of the three 
heavily laden ships. They stag- 
gered up slowly on great tails of 
flame. They rose on sharper jets 
until they were above the crater 
walls and against the black of 



space, carrying the men toward 
the rendezvous with Earth’s or- 
bital station. Sam watched until 
they were beyond the range of 
his strongest vision. Then, with- 
out orders or knowledge of why 
he acted, he turned into the 
dome. It was silent and empty 
around him. 

He stared at the clock on the 
wall and at the calendar that 
they had kept marked off. He 
hadn’t found how long they 
would be gone. But Smithers’ 
words gave a vague answer — he 
would have a lot of time to kill. 
That could mean anywhere from 
one month to most of a year, 
judging by the application of 
similar phrases in the past. He 
looked at the shelves filled with 
microbooks for a few moments. 
Then he went outside, to stare 
up at the Earth in the sky above 
him. There were spots of light 
in the dark areas that he knew 
to be the cities of men. There 
were men there, a quarter of a 
million miles away, and there 
must be speech and man-laugh- 
ter and singing. 

He stood there a long time, 
staring upwards. Finally he went 
back inside, to tidy up the mess 
the men had made in their hasty 
leaving. He folded the few spare 
clothes and put them away, 
cleaned the cooking equipment 
and straightened up as best he 
could. Hal had left the picture 



164 



GALAXY 



of the female man about whom 
he’d spoken so often, and Sam 
stared at it, trying again to un- 
derstand. At last, he put it care- 
fully into a drawer, closing it 
away from view. 

The microbooks Hal had liked 
to keep near him were in the 
same drawer, and they reminded 
Sam of Smithers’ last words. 

“Don’t forget the books!” The 
words seemed needless, since 
Sam could never forget unless 
ordered to do so. And the Chief 
had said there were no orders. 
There wasn’t even an order 
against reading the books now. 

And that, Sam realized, might 
have been what Smithers was in- 
dicating to him in those final 
words. 

The second day after the take- 
off of the ship, Sam was watch- 
ing the dark areas of Earth 
again when some of them grew 
suddenly brighter. New spots of 
brightness rose and decayed dur- 
ing the hours he watched. They 
were far brighter than any city 
should have been. Other spots 
glowed where no cities had been 
before. But eventually, they all 
faded. After that, there were no 
bright areas at all. 

As Earth turned slowly, he saw 
that all the cities on Earth were 
now dark. 

It was a mystery for which he 
had no explanation. He went in- 
side to try the radio that brought 



news and entertainment from 
the relay on the orbital station, 
but no signal was coming 
through. He debated calling 
them, but initiating such a call 
was reserved for Smithers. And 
he was gone. 

He was outside again, staring 
at Earth the next time the famil- 
iar spots that should have been 
cities swam into the darkened 
side of Earth. There were still 
no spots of lights. Even with the 
small telescope used for the in- 
frequent observations of Earth, 
he could detect no sign of the 
cities. There was only the hint 
of a dull glow in a few places, 
too diffuse to be from normal 
lights. And the radio was silent. 

T T e paced about, trying to 
-*■ force his eyes to see what 
was not there to see. Men had to 
be there! And the lights of their 
cities would be the proof of it 
— the assurance that men were 
still talking and making what 
they called jokes and singing, 
even if they were beyond his 
hearing. Now suddenly, he 
needed that proof, and there was 
no evidence! It was as if all men 
had disappeared with the going 
of the few from the Moon! 

Through all the fifth day, he 
waited before the radio with the 
gain turned up to its maximum. 
The men who had left here 
should have arrived at their des- 



TO AVENGE MAN 



165 



tination now. He knew there was 
no reason to expect such a call; 
men were not obligated to report 
to a robot, as they would have 
reported to other men. But his 
brain circuits had been filled 
with odd future-pictures that 
drove him to the set and kept 
him there for long hours after 
he knew there would be no sig- 
nal for him. 

Finally, he knew there would 
be no call. He got up and went 
into the empty room where the 
men had spent so much of their 
time. 

Eventually his pacing led him 
to the music player. They had let 
him use it at times, and he 
turned to it now, to fill the emp- 
tiness of the room and of his 
mind with sound. He found a 
tape that was one of his favorites 
and threaded it. But when the fi- 
nal chorus of Beethoven’s Ninth 
reached its end, the dome 
seemed more empty and silent 
than ever. He found another 
tape, without voices this time. 
And that was followed by an- 
other. It helped a little, but it 
was not enough. 

It was then that he turned to 
the books, taking one at ran- 
dom. It was something about 
Mars, by a human named Edgar 
Rice Burroughs, and he started 
to put it back. He had already 
learned enough about astronomy 
from the education machine. 



But at last he threaded it into 
the microreader and sat down 
to read. 

It started well enough, and it 
was about some strange kind of 
man, not about astronomy. But 
then 

Sam made a strange sound, 
only slowly realizing that he had 
imitated the groan of a man for 
the first time in his existence. It 
was all madness! 

He knew men had never 
reached Mars — and couldn’t 
reach this Mars, because the 
planet was totally unlike what 
he knew existed. It must be some 
strange form of human humor. 
Or else there were men unlike 
any he had known and facts that 
had been kept from him. The 
latter seemed more probable. 

He struggled through it, to 
groan again when it ended and 
he still didn’t know what had 
happened to the strange female 
man who was a princess and who 
laid highly impossible eggs. But 
by then he had begun to like 
John Carter. He wanted to read 
more. He was confused — but 
even more curious than puzzled. 
Eventually, he found the whole 
series and read them all. 

It was much later that one of 
the books solved some of the puz- 
zle for him. There was a small 
note before the book really be- 
gan: This is a work of specula- 
tive fiction; any resemblance to 



166 



GALAXY 



present-day persons or events is 
entirely coincidental. He looked 
up fiction in the dictionary he 
had seen the men use and felt 
better afterwards. It wasn’t quite 
like humor, but it wasn’t fact, 
either. It was a game of some 
kind, where the rules of life were 
all changed about in idiosyncra- 
tic ways. The writer might pre- 
tend that men liked to kill each 
other or were afraid of women, 
or some other ridiculous idea; 
then he tried to show what might 
happen. It was obviously taboo 
to pretend about real people and 
events, though some of the books 
had stories that used names and 
backgrounds that had the same 
names as those in reality. 

The best fiction of all some- 
times looked like books of fact, 
if the writer was clever enough. 
“History” was mostly that. There 
was a whole imaginary world 
called Rome, for instance. It was 
fortunate that Sam had been 
taught the simple facts of man’s 
progress by the education ma- 
chine before reading such books. 
Men, it was true, had sometimes 
been violent, but not when they 
understood all the facts or could 
help it. 

I n the end he evolved a sim- 
ple classification. If a book 
made him think hard and forced 
him to strain to follow it, it was 
fact; if it made him read faster 



and think less as he went 
through it, it was fiction. 

There was one book that was 
hardest of all to classify. It was 
an old book, written before men 
had gone out into space. Yet it 
was full of carefully documented 
and related facts about an inva- 
sion of flying saucers from far 
in space. Eventually he was 
forced to decide from the inter- 
nal evidence that it was fact; but 
it left him disturbed and unhap- 
py- 

Hal Norman had referred to 
inhuman war, and Dr. Smithers 
had mentioned an attack. Could 
it be that the strange ships from 
somewhere had struck Earth? 

He remembered the brilliant 
lights over the cities, so much 
like the great ray weapons des- 
cribed in some of the fiction 
about space war. Sometimes 
there were elements of truth 
even in fiction. There had been 
a book about men who went back 
in time and fought totally im- 
possible monsters — and then he 
had discovered that there really 
had been dinosaurs of that size 
and kind. 

There was a book about those 
who spoke for Boskone, and puz- 
zling suggestions that the evil 
men who seemed to have exist- 
ed were agents of that Boskone, 
or of the Eich. It would at least 
explain why the probably fic- 
tional Hitler could be treated as 



TO AVENGE MAN 



167 



fact, in books that otherwise did 
not seem to be fiction. 

If invaders had come in great 
ships to fight against Earth, it 
might take men longer than Sam 
cared to think about to fight 
them off. If there were flying 
saucers or ships of the Eich at- 
tacking Earth, some of his men 
might never come back at all! 
And there was nothing Sam 
could do here to help them. 

He went outside to stare at the 
sky. Earth still showed no sign 
of cities. They must be blacked 
out, as they would be if flying 
saucers were in their skies. He 
searched the space over the 
Moon, but he could find no 
strange craft. Then he went back 
inside to read through the mi- 
crobooks again. 

It was poetry that somehow 
finally shoved the worry from 
his mind. He had tried poetry 
before, and given up, unable to 
follow it. But this time he made 
a discovery. He tried reading it 
aloud, until it began to beat at 
him and force its rhythm on 
him. He was reading Swin- 
burne’s Hymn of Man, attracted 
by the title, and suddenly the 
words and something besides be- 
gan to sing their way into his 
deepest mind. 

He went back over four lines 
again and again, until they were 
music, or all that music had 
tried to say and had failed: 



“ In the gray beginning of things 
that began, 

“The word of the earth in the 
ears of the world, was it God? 
was it man?" 

Sam went up and down the 
dome for most of that day, 
chanting to himself that the 
word of the earth in the ears of 
the world was man! Then he 
turned back to other poetry. 

None quite equaled that one 
experience, but most of it stirred 
his circuits in strange ways. A 
book of limericks even surprised 
him twice to the point where he 
chuckled, without realizing that 
he had never done that spontan- 
eously before. 

There were slightly over four 
thousand volumes in the little li- 
brary, including the technical 
books. He timed them carefully, 
stretching them by rereading his 
favorites, until he finished the 
last at exactly midnight on the 
eve of the takeoff anniversary. 

The next twenty-four hours he 
spent outside the dome, watching 
the sky and staring at Earth, 
while his radio receptors 
scanned all the frequencies. 

It had been a lot of time al- 
ready killed. But there was no 
signal, and no rocket ship blast- 
ed down, bringing back the men. 

At midnight he gave a sighing 
sound and went back inside the 
dome. In the technical section. 



168

be unlocked the controls for the 
atomic generator and turned it 
down to its lowest idling rate. 
He came back, turning the now 
dim lights off as he moved. In 
the main room, he put his favor- 
ite tape on the player and the 
copy of Swinburne in the micro- 
reader. But he did not turn them 
on. Instead, he dropped his 
heavy body quietly onto the 
floor before the entrance, where 
the men would be sure to see him 
when they finally returned. 

Then one hand reached up 
firmly, and he turned himself 
off. 

IV 

Cam’s eyes turned toward 
the entrance as conscious- 
ness snapped on again. There 
was no sign of men there. He 
stood up, staring about the dome, 
then hastened outside to stare 
across the floor of the crater. It 
lay bare, except for the old 
wrecked rocket ship. 

Men had not come back. 

Inside again, he looked for 
something that might have fall- 
en and hit his switch. The switch 
itself was still in the off position, 
however. And when he turned 
on the tape player, no sound 
came. It was confirmation 
enough. Something had hap- 
pened to the air in the dome, 
and his internal switch had gone 



into operation to turn him on 
automatically. 

A few minutes later he found 
the hole. A meteoroid the size of 
an egg must have hit the surface 
above. It had struck with 
enough force to blast a tiny cra- 
terlet almost completely through 
the dome, and internal pressure 
had done the rest 

He secured patching material 
and began automatically mak- 
ing the repairs. There was still 
more than enough air in 
the tanks to fill the dome again. 

Sam sighed as the first whis- 
per of sound reached him from 
the tape player. He flipped his 
switch back to on position before 
the rising pressure negated the 
emergency circuit. He still had 
to get back to the entrance to 
resume his vigil. It had simply 
been bad luck that had aroused 
him before the men could re- 
turn. 

He moved back through the 
dome, hardly looking. But his 
eyes were open, and his mind 
gradually began to add the evi- 
dence. There was no way to tell 
how long he had been uncon- 
scious; he had no feeling of any 
time. But there was dust over 
everything — dust that had been 
disturbed by the outrushing air, 
but that had still patina-plated 
itself on metal firmly enough to 
remain. And some of the metal 
showed traces of corrosion. That 



TO AVENGE MAN 



169 



must have taken years! 

He stopped abruptly, checking 
his battery power. The cobalt- 
platinum cell had been fully 
charged when he lay down. Now 
it was at less than half charge. 
Such batteries had an extremely 
slow leakage. Even allowing for 
residual conductance through 
his circuits, it would have taken 
at least thirty years for such a 
loss! 

Thirty years! And the men 
had not come back. 

\ groan came to his ears, 
and he turned quickly. But 
it had only been his own voice. 
And now he began shouting. He 
was still trying to shout in the 
airless void as he reached the 
surface. He caught himself, brac- 
ing his back against the dome as 
his balance circuits reacted to 
some wild impulse from his 
brain. 

Men would never desert him. 
They had to come back to the 
Moon to finish their work, and 
the first thing they would do 
would be to find him. Men 
couldn’t just leave him there! 
Only in the wild fiction could 
that happen, and even there only 
the postulated evil men would 
do 'such a thing. His men would 
never dream of it! 

He stared up at Earth. The 
dome was in night again, and 
Earth was a great orb in the 



sky, glowing blue and white, 
with touches of brown in a few 
places. He saw the outline of 
continents through the cloud 
cover, and reorganized the great 
cities that must lie within the 
thin darkened area. There should 
have been lights visible there, 
even against the contrast of 
brighter Earthlight. 

But there was no light. 

He sighed soundlessly again, 
and now he felt himself relaxing. 
The attackers must still be hov- 
ering there! The dangerous Ufo- 
things from space. Men were still 
embattled and unable to return 
to him. Thirty years of that for 
them, and here he was losing 
balance over what had been only 
a year of his conscious time! 

He faced the worst of possi- 
bilities more calmly now. He 
even forced himself to admit 
that men might have been so 
badly crippled by the war that 
they could not return to him — 
perhaps not for more time than 
he could think of. Smithers had 
said they were abandoning 
space, at a time when the attack 
had not yet come. How long 
would it take to recover and re- 
gain their lost territory? 

He went back into the dome, 
but the radio was silent. Hesi- 
tantly, he initiated a call to the 
orbital station. After half an 
hour, he gave up. The men there, 
if men were still there, must be 



170 



GALAXY 



keeping strict radio silence. 

“All right,” he said slowly in- 
to the silence of the dome. “All 
right, face it. Men aren’t coming 
back for a robot. Ever!” 

It was a speech out of the fic- 
tion he had read, rather than out 
of rationality. But somehow say- 
ing it loudly made it easier to 
face. Men could not come to him. 
He wasn’t that valuable to them. 

He shook his head over that, 
remembering the time he had 
been taken back to Earth after 
twenty years out of the creche 
and on the Moon. The Mark One 
robots had all been destroyed in 
the accidents and difficulties of 
getting the Base established, ex- 
cept for Sam. Supposedly better 
Mark Two robots were sent to 
replace them, but they had been 
beset by some circuit flaws that 
made them more prone to acci- 
dent and less useful than the 
first models. More than a hun- 
dred had been sent in all — and 
none had remained. It was then 
they called Sam back to study 
him. 

nphere, deep in the security- 
hidden underground robot 
development workshops, he had 
been tested in every way they 
knew to help them in designing 
the Mark Three robots. And 
there old Stephen DeMatre had 
interviewed him for three whole 
days. At the end of that time, the 



man who had first introduced 
him to his place with men had 
put a hand on his metal shoul- 
der and smiled at him. 

“You’re unique, Sam,” he’d 
said. “A lucky combination of 
all the wild guesses we used in 
making each Mark One individ- 
ually, as well as some unique 
conditioning among that first 
Base staff. We don’t dare dupli- 
cate you yet, but some day the 
circuit control computer is go- 
ing to want to get your pattern 
in full for later brains. So take 
good care of yourself. I’d keep 
you here, but ... You take care 
of yourself, Sam. You hear me?” 

Sam had nodded. “Yes, sir. Do 
you mean you can make other 
brains exactly like mine?” 

“Technically, the control 
computer can duplicate your de- 
sign,” DeMatre had answered. 
“It won’t be just like your brain 
— too many random factors in 
any really advanced mechanical 
mind unit — but with similar ca- 
pabilities. That’s why you’re 
worth more money than this 
whole project without you. 
You’re worth quite a few mil- 
lion dollars, and it’s up to you 
to see valuable property like 
that isn’t destroyed. Right, 
Sam?” 

Sam had agreed and been 
shipped back to the Moon, along 
with the first of the Mark Three 
robots. And maybe his trip back 



TO AVENGE MAN 



171 



had been of some use, since the 
new models worked as well as 
their limitations permitted. 
They were far better than the 
preceding models. 

Maybe he wasn’t valuable 
enough to men for them to come 
for him now. But by DeMatre’s 
own words, he was one of their 
most valuable possessions. If it 
was up to him to see that he 
wasn’t destroyed, then it was up 
to him also to see that he wasn’t 
lost to men. 

If they couldn’t come for him, 
he had to go to them. 

The question was: How? He 
couldn’t project himself by 
mind power like John Carter. 
He had to have a rocket! 

With the thought, he went 
dashing out through the en- 
trance and heading toward the 
old wreck. It stood exactly as it 
had after the landing that had 
ruined it, with half its hull plat- 
ing ripped off and most of its 
rocket motors broken. It could 
never be flown again. Nor could 
the old supply capsules. They 
had burned out their tubes in 
getting here, being of minimum 
construction. There wasn’t even 
room inside one for him. 

Sam considered it, making 
measurements and doing the 
hardest thinking of his exis- 
ence. Without the long study of 
all the technical manuals of the 
dome library, he could never 



have found an answer. But even- 
tually he nodded. 

A motor from the big shop 
could be fitted to a capsule. It 
would be barely strong enough. 
But the plating could be re- 
moved to lighten the little ship; 
Sam needed no protection from 
space. And the automatic guid- 
ance system could be removed to 
make enough room for him. He 
could operate it manually, since 
his reaction and integrating 
times were faster than that of 
even the system. 

Fuel would be a problem, 
though there was enough oxy- 
gen in the dome storage tanks. It 
would have to be hydrogen, 
since he could find rocks from 
which that could be released by 
the power of the generator. For- 
tunately, lunar gravity was 
easier to escape than that of 
Earth. 

He went back to the dome and 
found paper and pencil. He was 
humming softly to himself as he 
began laying out his plan. It 
wasn’t easy. He might not be 
skilled enough to pilot the 
strange craft to the station. And 
it would take a great deal of 
time. But Sam was going to the 
men who wouldn’t come to him! 

V 

I t takes experience to turn

GALAXY 



practice. Almost three years had 
passed since Sam’s awakening 
before the orbital station swam 
slowly into view before him. 
And the erratic takeoff and 
flight had been one that no hu- 
man body could have stood. But 
now he sighted on the huge met- 
al doughnut before him, estimat- 
ing its orbit carefully. There 
were only a few gallons of fuel 
remaining in the tanks behind 
him, and he had to reach the 
landing net at the first try. 

His first calculations seemed 
wrong. He glanced down at the 
huge orb of Earth and flipped 
sun filters over his eyes. Some- 
thing was wrong. The station 
was not holding its bottom point- 
ed exactly at the center of Earth 
as it should have done; it was 
turning very slowly, and even 
its spin was uneven, as if the wa- 
ter used to balance it against 
wobbling had not been distribu- 
ted properly. Beside it, the little 
ferry ship used between station 
and ships from Earth was jerk- 
ing slightly on the silicone-plas- 
tic line that held it. 

Sam felt an unpleasant stir- 
ring in his chest where most of 
his brain circuits lay. But he 
forced it down and computed his 
blast for all the factors. He had 
learned something of the behav- 
ior of his capsule during the 
minutes of takeoff and the later 
approach to the station. His fin- 



gers moved delicately, and fuel 
metered out to the cranky little 
motor. 

It was not a perfect match, but 
he managed to catch himself in 
the net around the entrance to 
the hub. He pulled himself free, 
as the capsule drifted off, and 
began scrambling up to the lock. 
A moment later, he was stand- 
ing in the weightlessness of the 
receiving section. And from the 
sounds of his feet, there was still 
air in the station. 

He froze motionless as he let 
himself realize he had made it. 
Then he began looking for the 
men who should have seen his 
approach and be coming to ques- 
tion him. 

There was no sound of steps or 
of any other activity, except for 
his own movements. Nor was 
there any light from the bulbs 
above him. The only illumina- 
tion was from a thick quarts 
port that faced directly into the 
sun. 

Sam cut on the lamp built in- 
to his chest, and began sweeping 
the sections of the hub with its 
light. Dust had formed a patina 
here, too. He sighed softly into 
the air. Then he moved toward 
the outer sections, his step de- 
termined. 

Half-way down the tube that 
ran from the hub to the outer 
hull, Sam stopped and cut off 
his light. Ahead of him there 



TO AVENGE MAN

was a glow! Lights were still 
burning! 

T Te let out a yell to call the 
men and began running, ad- 
justing for the increasing feeling 
of weight as he moved outward. 
Then he was under the bulb. 

He stared up at it — a single 
bulb burning among several oth- 
ers that were black, though they 
were on the same circuit. How 
long did it take for these bulbs 
to burn out? Years surely, and 
probably decades. Yet most of 
the station was in darkness, 
though there was still power 
from the atomic generator. 

He found a few other bulbs 
burning in the outer station, but 
not many. The great reception 
and recreation room was empty. 
Beyond that, the offices were 
mostly open and vacant. Some 
held a litter of paper and other 
stuff, as if someone had gone 
through carelessly, not bother- 
ing to put anything back in 
place. The living section with its 
tiny sleeping cubicles was worse. 
Some of the rooms were simply 
bare, but others were in com- 
plete disorder. Four showed 
signs of long occupancy, with 
the sleeping nets worn almost 
through and not replaced. But 
nothing showed how recent- 
ly they had been left. 

He went through another sec- 
tion devoted to station machin- 



ery and came to a big room that 
was apparently now used for 
storage. Sam had seen a plan of 
the station in one of the older 
books in the dome. He placed 
this room as one designed as a 
storage for hydrogen bombs 
once. But that had been from 
the pre-civilized days of men, 
and the bombs had been dis- 
mantled and destroyed more 
than sixty years before. 

It was in the hydroponics 
room that he was forced to face 
the truth. The plants there had 
been the means of replacing the 
oxygen in the air for the men, 
and now the tanks were dry and 
the vegetation had been dead so 
long that only dessicated stalks 
remained. There could be no 
men here. He didn’t need the 
sight of the bare food section for 
confirmation. Some men had 
stayed here until the food was 
gone before they left the un- 
tended plants to die. It must 
have been many years ago that 
they had abandoned the station. 

Sam shook his head in anger • 
at himself. He should have 
guessed it when he saw that there 
were none of the winged rocket 
ships waiting outside the station. 
So long as men were here, they 
would have kept some means for 
return to Earth. 

The observatory was dark, 
but there was still power for the 
electronic telescope. The screen 



174 



GALAXY 



lighted at his touch, showing 
only empty space. He had to 
wait nearly two hours before the 
slow tumble of the station 
brought Earth into full view. 

Most of it was in daylight, and 
there was only a thin cloud cov- 
er. Once a thousand cities could 
have been scanned plainly from 
here. When seeing was best, even 
streams of moving cars could be 
seen. But now there were no 
cities and no signs of movement! 

Sam emitted a harsh gasping 
sound as he scanned the contin- 
ent of North America. He had 
seen pictures of New York, Chi- 
cago and several other city com- 
plexes from this view. Now there 
was only dark ruin showing 
where they had been. It came to 
him with an almost physical 
shock that perhaps millions of 
human beings had died in those 
wrecks of cities. 

There were still smaller towns 
where he could make out the 
pattern of houses. But there was 
no movement, even there. 

He cut power from the tele- 
scope with an angry flick of his 
finger, trying to blot the things 
he had seen from his memory. A 
moment later, he had power on 
again and was hunting down 
roadways and rivers for signs of 
movement. But there was no evi- 
dence of man. And all of the 
ruins looked old and weathered, 
as if there had been no man to 



fight on for a great many years. 

He sagged against the tele- 
scope, his mind filled with pic- 
tures he could not control. Great 
ships ravening out of space, car- 
rying savage alien monsters and 
bringing planet-wrecking rays 
against Earth. There had been 
no Lens, no miracle to save 
Earth. There had been only the 
ruin of all man’s achievements. 
And man had been gone before 
Sam had finished his first year 
of waiting. 

T T e shook off his imaginings 
by force of will. There had 
been men here on the station. 
They must have left some rec- 
ords. 

He moved rapidly away from 
the observatory, hunting for the 
communications section. It was 
in worse shape than most other 
places when he found it. It 
looked as if some man had de- 
liberately tried to wreck the ma- 
chinery. A hammer lay tangled 
in a maze of ruin that must once 
have been the main receiver. 
There was something that looked 
like dried blood on a metal cab- 
inet, with a dent that might have 
fitted a human fist. 

The floor was littered with 
tape that should have held a rec- 
ord of all the communications 
received and sent, and the drive 
capstan on the tape player was 
bent into uselessness. Sam lift- 



176 



GALAXY 



ed a section of tape and placed it 
in the slot that gave his face a 
sad caricature of a mouth. The 
tape sensors moved into place, 
and he began scanning the bit of 
plastic. It was blank, probably 
wiped of any message by time 
and the unshielded transformer 
that was still humming below 
the contnpl panel. 

Most of the tape cabinet was 
empty, and there was nothing 
on tapes within. Sam ripped 
open drawers, hunting for some 
evidence. He finally found a sin- 
gle tape in the cabinet dented by 
a fistprint, lying at the back 
with the reel broken as if it had 
been hurled savagely into the 
drawer. Most of the impression 
on the tape was a garble of sta- 
tic; stray fields had gotten to it, 
even through the metal of the 
cabinet. But towards the end, a 
few words could barely be picked 
out from the noise.

from the blast. Thought we’d

vor. I must be. For God’s sake,

The noise grew worse then, to- 
tally ruining intelligibility. Sam 
caught bits of what might have 
been sentences, but they made no 
sense to him; they seemed to be 
pure gibberish. Then suddenly a 
small section of the tape against 
the hub became almost clear. 

The voice was high-pitched 
now, and overmodulated, as if 
the words had been too loud to 
be carried by the transmitter. 
There was a strange, unpleasant 
quality that Sam had never 
heard in a human voice before.

it couldn’t fool me. I knew it was

there, waiting for me to come out.

They’re clever now, they won’t 
let me see them. But when I 
turn my back, I can feel . 

The tape came to an end. 

Sam could make no sense of it, 
though he replayed it all again 
in hopes of finding some other 
clue. He gave up and reached 
down to shut off the power in 
the transformer. It was amazing 
that the wreckage hadn’t already 
blown all the fuses for this sec- 
tion. He groped for the switch 
and flipped it, just as his eyes 
spotted something under the 
transformer shelf. 

It was a fountain pen, gold and 
black enamel. 

Sam had seen one like it 
countless times, and now he 



TO AVENGE MAN 



177 



turned it over in his hands, to 
see familiar lettering engraved 
on the barrel: RPS. Those were 
the initials of Dr. Smithers, and 
the pen could only have been 
his. He’d been one of those who 
had reached the station, proba- 
bly one who had waited there to 
receive that strange message 
from Earth. The Moon ships 
had made it safely, and Smithers 
had stayed on here until the food 
was gone. Then he must have re- 
turned to Earth where the tape 
indicated at least one man still 
survived, after the attack was 
over. 

The telescope had showed no 
sign of men. But if there were 
only a few men left on the im- 
mense face of the planet below, 
the chance of finding any evi- 
dence of them was too slight to 
determine. 

The search must be made from 
the surface of Earth, not from 
this useless station in the sky. 

I n theory, getting back to 
Earth from the station 
wasn’t too difficult. A small ret- 
ro-thrust from a rocket could 
slow its speed and change its or- 
bit enough to bring it down to 
the atmosphere. Then any 
winged craft with shallow 
enough an angle of glide could 
be maneuvered down slowly to 
avoid burning from the friction 
of the air. 

178 



There was more than enough 
sheet metal in the sheathing of 
the station to provide modifica- 
tions to the little ferry, and there 
were books that showed most de- 
tails of the design of the regu- 
lar landing craft. There was even 
enough fuel; the emergency 
tanks in the station were half 
filled with the monopropellant 
suited for the little rocket motor 
in the ferry. 

Sam had allowed himself per- 
haps a month to complete the 
task. But at the end of that time, 
he was swearing, using unpro- 
fane but colorful words he had 
learned from a score of histori- 
cal novels. By then he was be- 
ginning to realize that the gap 
between theory and practice was 
enormous. He would be lucky to 
finish his work in a year, and 
then the results would be crude 
and uncertain. 

The sheet metal was already 
all work-hardened, and there 
was no annealing oven to pre- 
pare it for reshaping. There was 
no press or large sheet metal 
brake in the tiny shop provided 
in the station. Even the welders 
were designed only for small re- 
pair. No transformer was suit- 
able for constructing a larger 
welder, and he was forced to re- 
wind one of the power cores, 
hoping that it would carry the 
amperage he needed. 

Tt took two weeks of hard work 

GALAXY 



to draw in the ferry, tie it down 
firmly to the hub against the 
wobbling of the station, and con- 
struct a crude scaffolding around 
it. Then he discovered that the 
hub was in the shadow of the 
station too much of the time, 
making metal there brittle with 
cold. The whole job had to be 
undone, the ferry moved to the 
top of the station and the en- 
tire scaffolding rebuilt. 

The framework for his wings, 
controls and nose cone had to be 
built up by welding together a 
network of small plumbing 
pipes; they were too heavy and 
he was forced to build another 
framework through the walls of 
the ferry and across most of the 
small cabin. It left him barely 
room for himself. Then he dis- 
covered by bitter trial that there 
was no way to form the sheet 
metal around the frame without 
so much welding that air turbu- 
lence would have made atmo- 
spheric maneuvering quite im- 
possible. 

He finally was forced to hand 
form his wing covering on a 
crude mold built on the main 
deck of the station, fighting to 
force the sheets into their prop- 
er curves by repeated careful 
hammering. When finally fin- 
ished, they were too large to 
move through the halls, and he 
was forced to cut a new path out 
through the station. It was made 



possible only because he had no 
need of air to breathe. 

Even the fuel turned out to be 
a problem. Thirty years of sit- 
ting in the tanks had started a 
slow process that resulted in 
small tarry filaments through- 
out. Pint by slow pint, it had to 
be filtered and refiltered until it 
was clear enough to pass 
through the tiny nozzle of the 
injector on the motor. By then 
he knew it would have been sim- 
pler to centrifuge it. But at last 
it was done.

Qurprisingly, the modified 
^ ferry behaved far better 
than Sam had dared to hope. It 
heated badly at the first touches 
of atmosphere, but the tempera- 
ture remained within the limits 
he and the craft could stand. He 
learned slowly to control the 
descent to a glide neither too 
shallow for stability nor too 
steep to avoid overheating. By 
the time he was down to thirty 
miles above the surface, he was 
almost pleased with the way it 
handled. 

He had set his course to reach 
the underground creche that had 
been his home at awakening and 
during the first three years of 
his education, before they sent 
him to the Moon. It was the only 
home he knew on Earth. 



TO AVENGE MAN 



179 



Now he saw that he could nev- 
er make it. The first fifteen min- 
utes in the upper layers of at- 
mosphere had been at too steep 
a glide angle, and he could nev- 
er reach far inland. He might 
even have trouble reaching the 
shore at all, he realized; when 
the clouds thinned, he could see 
nothing but ocean under him. 

He opened the rocket motor 
behind him gently, letting its 
thrust raise his speed to the 
highest his little craft could take 
at this altitude. But there was too 
little fuel left to help much. It 
might have given him an extra 
twenty miles of glide, but not 
more. 

Sam considered the prospects 
of landing in the water with 
grim foreboding. He could exist 
in it for a while, even at fair 
depths. If he landed near the 
shore, he might work his way 
out. But within a limited period 
of time, the water would pene- 
trate through his body to some 
of the vital wiring. Once that was 
shorted, he would cease to exist. 

He came down under the 
clouds, fighting for every inch of 
altitude. Then, far ahead, he 
could see the shore. There were 
no islands here, so it had to be 
the mainland. Once there, he 
"could reach the creche in a sin- 
gle day. 

He passed over the shoreline 
at a height of five hundred feet 



There was a short stretch of sand, 
some woods, and then a long ex- 
panse of green that must be 
grass. He eased the control for- 
ward, then back again. 

The little ship came skim- 
ming down at two hundred miles 
an hour. Its skids touched the 
surface, and it bounced upwards. 
Sam fought the controls to keep 
it from nosing over. Again it 
touched, jerking with decelera- 
tion. This time it seemed to have 
struck right. Then a hummock of 
ground caught against one skid. 
The craft slithered sideways and 
flipped over. Sam braced him- 
self as the ship began coming to 
pieces around him. 

IT e pulled himself out, star- 
-*• -*■ ing at the wreckage. It was 
a shame that it was ruined, he 
thought. But it couldn’t be made 
as strong as he was and still glide 
through the air. 

He turned to study the world 
around him. The grass was knee- 
high, moving gently in the wind. 
Beyond it lay woods. Sam had 
seen only pictures of trees like 
that before. He moved toward 
them, noticing the thickness of 
the underbrush around them. 
Below them, the dirt was dark 
and moist. He lifted a pinch to 
his face, moving his smell re- 
ceptors forward in his mouth 
slit. It was a rich smell, richer 
than the stuff in the hydroponic 



180 



GALAXY 



tanks. He lifted his head to look 
for the birds he expected, but he 
could see no sign of them. There 
were only insects, buzzing and 
humming. 

The sun had already set, he 
noticed. Yet it was not yet dark. 
There was a paling of the light, 
and a soft diffusion. He shook 
his head. Above him, tiny twink- 
ling spots began to appear. He 
had read that stars twinkled, but 
he had thought it only fiction. 
He had never been under the 
open sky of Earth before. 

Then a soft murmur of sound 
reached him. He started away, to 
be drawn back to it. Slowly he 
realized it was a sound like the 
description of that heard near 
the sea. He had never seen an 
ocean, either. And now one lay 
no more than a mile away. 

He stumbled through the 
woods in the growing darkness. 
For some reason, he was reluc- 
tant to turn on his light. Even- 
tually he learned to make his 
way through the brush and 
around the trees. The sound 
grew louder as he progressed. 

It was dark when he reached 
the seashore, but there was a 
hint of faint light to the east. As 
he watched, it increased. A pale 
white arc appeared over the hor- 
izon and grew to a large circle. 
The Moon, he realized finally. 

The waves rose and fell, boom- 
ing into surf. And far out 



across the sea, the Moon seemed 
to ride on the waves, casting a 
silver road of light over the wa- 
ter. 

Sam had read the word. Now 
for the first time, he found an 
understanding of it. This was 
Beauty. 

He sighed as he heaved him- 
self from the sand and began 
heading along the shore in 
search of a road that would take 
him westward. No wonder men 
wanted to come back to defend 
a world where something like 
this could be seen. 

The moon rose higher as he 
moved on, its light now bright 
enough to give him clear vision. 
He came over a small rise in the 
ground and spotted what seemed 
to be a road beyond it. Beside 
the road was a house. It was dark 
and quiet, but he swung aside, 
going through a copse of woods 
to reach it and search for any 
evidence of humanity. 

The windows were mostly 
broken he saw as he ap- 
proached. And weeds had 
grown up around it. There was a 
detached building beside it that 
held a small car, by what he 
could see through the single 
dusty window. He skirted that 
and reached the door of the 
house; it opened at his touch, its 
hinges protesting rustily. 

Inside, the moonlight shone 
through the broken windows on 



TO AVENGE MAN 



181 



a jumble of furniture that was 
overturned and scattered in no 
order Sam could see. And there 
were other things — white things 
that lay sprawled about on the 
floor. 

IT e recognized them from 

^ the pictures in the books — 
skeletons of human beings. Two 
small skeletons were tangled in 
one comer with their skulls 
bashed in. A male skeleton lay 
near them, with the rusty shape 
of a knife shoved through a 
scrap of clothing between two 
ribs. There was a revolver near 
one hand. Across the room, a fe- 
male skeleton was a jumbled 
pile of bones, with a small hole 
in the skull that could have 
come from a bullet. 

Sam backed out of the room. 
He knew the meaning of anoth- 
er word now. He had seen Mad- 
ness. 

Men had learned to build 
good machines. The car motor 
barely turned over after Sam 
had figured out the controls, but 
it caught and began running 
with only a slight sputtering. 
The tires were slightly soft, but 
they took the bumps of the rut- 
ted little rail. Later, when Sam 
found a better road, they lasted 
under he punishment of high 
speed. Most of the road was 
clear. There were few vehicles 
along its way, and most of those 



seemed to have drifted to the 
shoulder before they stopped or 
crashed. 

The sun was just rising when 
Sam located the place where the 
factory and warehouse had 
served as a legitimate cover for 
the secret underground robot 
project. Fire and weather had 
left only gutted ruins and rusty 
things that had once been ma- 
chines. But the section that 

housed the creche entrance now 
stood apart from the rest, almost 
unharmed. 

Sam moved into it and to the 
metal door openly concealed 

among other such doors. He 

should probably not have known 
the combination, but men were 
often careless among robots. He 
had been curious enough to note 
the details, and Sam did not for- 
get. He bent to what seemed to 
be an ornamental grille and 

called out a series of numbers. 

The door seemed to stick a lit- 
tle, but then it moved aside. Be- 
yond lay the elevator, and that 
operated smoothly at the com- 
bination he punched. Power was 
still on, at least. There was no 
light, but the bulbs sprang into 
life as he found a switch. 

He called out once, but he no 
longer expected to find men so 
easily. The place had the feel of 
abandonment. And while it could 
have protected its workers from 
almost anything, there had been 



182 



GALAXY 



only enough food and water 
stocked here for two weeks. 
There were a few signs that it 
had been used for a shelter, but 
most of it was still in very good 
order. 

He moved past offices and la- 
boratories toward the back. The 
real creche, with its playrooms 
and learning devices was empty, 
he saw. No robots had been re- 
ceiving post- awakening training. 
Sam was not surprised. Most of 
the work here had been devoted 
to research or the possibilities 
of robots. Actual construction 
was only a necessary sideline. 
Usually the brain complexes had 
been created and tested without 
bodies, and then extinguished be- 
fore there had been a full 
awakening. 

He started toward the educator 
computer out of his old habits. 
But it was only a machine that 
had programmed his progress 
from prepared tapes and memory 
circuits. It could not help him 
now. 

Beyond the creche lay the 
heart of the whole affair. Here 
the brain complexes were as- 
sembled from components ac- 
cording to esoteric calculations. 
This was work that required a 
computer that was itself intelli- 
gent to some extent. It had to 
make sense out of the desirable 
options given it by men, then 
form the brain paths needed. 



either during construction or 
during the initial period before 
awakening. Everything that Sam 
had been before awakening had 
come from this. That pattern 
would still be recorded, along 
with what the great computer 
had learned of him during his 
return here five years before 
men abandoned the Moon. 

Cam moved toward the ma- 
^2 chine, gazing in surprise at 
the amount of work lying about. 
There were boxes of robot bodies 
crammed into every storage 
space. They could never have 
been assembled in such numbers 
here during the period he re- 
membered. And beyond lay 
shelves jammed with the com- 
ponents for the brain complexes. 
With such supplies, enough ro- 
bots could be made to supply 
the Lunar Base needs for genera- 
tions. 

The computer itself was large- 
ly hidden far below, but its panel 
came to life at his touch. It 
waited. 

“This is Robot Ninety-Three, 
Mark One,” Sam said. “You 
have authorization on file.” 

The authorization from Dr. 
DeMatre should have been can- 
celed. But the machine did not 
switch on alarm circuits. A thin 
cable of filaments reached out 
and passed into Sam’s mouth slit. 
It retracted, and the speaker 



TO AVENGE MAN 



183 



came to life. “There is authori- 
zation. What is wanted?” 

“What is the correct date?” 
Sam asked. Then he grunted as 
the answer came from the ma- 
chine’s isotope clock. 

It had been more than thirty- 
seven years since the men had 
left the Moon. He shook his 
head, and the robot bodies caught 
his attention again. “Why are so 
many robots being built?” 

“Orders were received for one 
thousand robots trained to fly 
missiles. Orders were suspended 
by Director DeMatre. No orders 
have been received for removing 
parts.” 

“Do you know what happened 
to the men?” Sam had little hope 
of finding an easy answer any 
more, but he had to ask. 

The machine seemed to hesi- 
tate. “Insufficient data. Orders 
were given by Director DeMatre 
to monitor broadcasts. Broad- 
casts were monitored. Analysis 
is incomplete. Data of doubtful 
coherence. Requests for more 
data were broadcast on all fre- 
quencies for six hours. Relevant 
replies were not received. Re- 
quest further information if avail- 
able.” 

“Never mind,” Sam told it. 
“Can you teach me how to fly 
a plane?” 

“Robot Ninety-Three, Mark 
One, was programmed with es- 
tablished ability to control all 



vehicles. Further instruction not 
necessary.” 

Sam grunted in amazement. 
He’d been surprised at how well 
he had controlled the landing 
craft and then the car. But it 
had never occurred to him that 
such knowledge had been built 
in. 

“All right,” he decided. “Start 
broadcasting again on all the 
frequencies you can handle. If 
you get any answers, find where 
the sender is and record it. If 
anyone asks who is calling, say 
you’re calling for me and take 
any message. Tell them I’ll be 
back in one month.” He started 
to turn away, then remembered. 
“Finished for now.” 

The machine darkened. Sam 
headed out to find a field some- 
where that might still have an 
operable plane. But he was al- 
ready beginning to suspect what 
he would find.

rass grew and flowers bloom- 
'-J ed. Ants built nests and 
crickets chirped in the soft sum- 
mer night. The seas swarmed 
with marine life of most kinds. 
And reptiles sunned themselves 
on rocks, or retired to their holes 
when the sun was too hot. 

But on all the Earth, no warm- 
blooded animal could be found. 

The Earth of man was without 



184 



GALAXY 



form and void. The cities were 
slag heaps from which radioac- 
tivity still radiated. No fires 
burned on the hearthstones of 
the most isolated houses. The 
villages were usually burned, 
sometimes apparently by acci- 
dent, but often as if they had 
been fired deliberately by their 
owners. 

The Moon was a thing of glory 
over Lake Michigan. It was the 
only glorious thing for six hun- 
dred miles. Four returned winged 
rockets rested on a field in Flori- 
da, but there was no sign of what 
had become of the men who 
rode down from the station in 
them. One winged craft stood 
forlornly outside Denver, and 
there was a scrawl in crayon in- 
side its port that spelled the 
worst obscenity in the English 
language. 

There was a library still stand- 
ing in Phoenix, and the last 
newspaper had the dateline of 
the day when Sam had seen the 
lights brighten over the cities of 
Earth. Most of the front page 
was occupied by a large box 
which advised its readers that 
the government had taken over 
all radio communications during 
the crisis and would broadcast 
significant news on the hour. The 
paper was cooperating with the 
government in making all such 
news available by broadcast 
only. The same box appeared in 



the nine preceding issues. Be- 
fore that, the major news seemed 
to involve a political campaign 
in United South Africa. 

Other scattered small libraries 
had papers that were no differ- 
ent Yet the only clue was in 
one of those places. It was a 
piece of paper resting under the 
hand of a skeleton that was scat- 
tered before bound copies of a 
technical journal. The paper was 
covered with doodles and stained 
in what might have been blood. 
But the words were legible: 

“Lesson for the day. Assign 
to all students. Politics: Men 
could not win such a war and 
that is obvious. Chemistry: Their 
nerve gas was similar to one we 
tested in small quantities. It 
seemed safe. Yet when they 
dropped it over us in both 
Northern and Southern hemi- 
spheres, it did not settle out as 
the test batches had done. 
Proved, that aerosols must be 
tested in massive quantities. 
Medicine: Bonny was in the 
shelter with me three weeks, yet 
there was still enough in the air 
to make her die in the ecstasty 
of a theophany. Geography: The 
wind patterns have been known 
for years. In three weeks, they 
reach all the Earth. Psychology: 
I am mad. But my madness is 
that I am become only cold 
logic without a soul. Therefore, 
I must kill myself. Religion: 



TO AVENGE MAN 



185 



Nothing matters. I am mad. God 
is — ” 

That was all. 

r T''he creche was still the same, 
of course. Sam sat before the 
entrance three nights after his 
return to his only home on Earth, 
staring at the Moon that was 
rising over the horizon. 

It was a full Moon again, and 
there was beauty to it, even here. 
But he was only vaguely aware 
of that. Below him, the great 
computer was quiescent now. It 
had taken all the mass of tiny 
details he had gathered and had 
integrated them with all of the 
millions of facts it already knew. 
Such a job had taken time, even 
for such a machine. But a few 
hours after his return it called 
him over the radio frequencies to 
issue its report. 

“All data correlated,” was its 
announcement. “Data not fully 
coherent with previous data. De- 
gree of relevancy approaches 
zero. Data insufficient for con- 
clusion.” 

Then it had gone back to 
stand-by, while Sam had sought 
the sight of living plants and in- 
sects outside the creche. 

He had expected little else 
from the computer. He had 
known there was too little for a 
logical conclusion. 

But his own conclusion was 
drawn now. As he sat under the 



light of the Moon, staring at the 
sky from which evil had come, 
there was a coldness in his brain 
complex that seemed deeper than 
the reaches of space. 

Men were gone. He had faced 
that fact during the early days 
of his search, and now he was 
learning to live with it. There 
were no more of his creators. He 
would go on searching for them, 
of course, in the faint hope that 
a paltry few might have survived 
somehow, somewhere. But he was 
certain that the search would be 
in vain. 

They had come from some- 
where out there, he thought bit- 
terly. The Eich, the minions of 
Boskone, or some other horror 
equally evil had appeared more 
than a century before and 
snooped and sniffed at Earth in 
their various saucers, only to 
leave. Now they had come back, 
giving Earth only a week’s warn- 
ing of their approach. They had 
struck all Earth with glowing 
bombs or radiation that ruined 
the cities of men. And when men 
still survived in spite of their 
rain of destruction, they had re- 
sorted to a deadly mist of in- 
sanity that was borne by the 
winds to every part of the planet. 
“They dropped it over us,” the 
note had said. And the wonder- 
ful race Sam had known had 
died in madness, usually of some 
destructive kind.

There had not even been a 
purpose to it. They hadn’t want- 
ed the Earth for themselves. 
They had simply come and 
slaughtered, to depart as sense- 
lessly as they had departed be- 
fore. 

Sam beat his fist against his 
leg until the metal clanged 
through the night. Then he lifted 
his other fist toward the stars 
and shook it. 

It was wrong that the alien in- 
vaders should escape from pun- 
ishment. 

They had come with fire and 
pestilence, and they should be 
found and overcome with all that 
they had meted out of mankind. 
He had supposed that evil was 
something found only in fiction. 
But now evil was ruler of the uni- 
verse. It should be met as it was 
usually met in fiction. It should 
be wiped from existence in a 
suffering as great as it had af- 
flicted. But such justice was ap- 
parently the one great lie of fic- 
tion. 

He beat his fists resoundingly 
against his legs again and shouted 
at the Moon, but there was no 
relief for what was burning deep 
in him. 

Then his ears picked up a new 
sound and he stopped all mo- 
tion to listen. It came again, 
very weakly and from very far 
away. 

“Help!” 



Tie shouted back audibly and 
* -*-by radio and was on his feet, 
running toward the sound. His 
feet crashed through the brush 
and he leaped over the rubble, 
making no effort to find the 
easy path. As he stopped to listen 
again, he heard the sound, di- 
rectly ahead, but even weaker. 
A minute later he almost stum- 
bled over the caller. 

It was a robot. Once it had 
been slim and neat, covered with 
black enamel. Now it was bent 
and bare metal was exposed. But 
it was still a Mark Three. It lay 
without motion, only a whisper 
coming from its speaker. 

Sam felt disappointment strike 
through all his brain complex, 
but he bent over the prone figure, 
testing quickly. It was power 
failure, he saw at once. He rip- 
ped a spare battery from the 
pack that had been with him 
during his long search and slam- 
med it quickly into place, re- 
placing the corroded one that 
had been there. 

The little robot sat up and be- 
gan trying to get to its feet. Sam 
reached out a helping hand, star- 
ing down at the worn, battered 
legs that seemed beyond any 
hope of functioning. 

“You need help,” he admitted. 
“You need a whole new body. 
Well, there are a thousand new 



TO AVENGE MAN 



187 



ones going to waste in the creche, 
ready for you to use. What’s 
your number?” 

It had to be one of the robots 
from the Moon. Men had never 
permitted any robots to remain 
on Earth. 

The robot teetered for a mo- 
ment, then seemed to gain some 
mastery over its legs. “Joe. They 
called me Joe. I’m glad I 
heard your signal over the radio 
weeks ago, but it was a long 
way. My transmitter is broken. 
I couldn’t answer you. A long 
way, and I was afraid I would 
fail before I could reach here. 
But now hurry. We can’t waste 
time here.” 

“We’ll hurry. But that way,” 
Sam told him, pointing toward 
the creche. 

Joe shook his head, making 
a creaking, horrible sound of it. 
“No, Sam. He can’t wait. I think 
he’s dying! He was sick when I 
heard the call from you, but he 
insisted I bring him here. He — ” 

“Sick? Dying? There’s a man 
with you?” 

Joe nodded jerkily and point- 
ed. 

S am scooped the light figure 
up in his arms. Even on 
Earth, it was no great load for 
his larger body, and they could 
make much better time than by 
letting the other try to run. Hal, 
Sam thought. It was probably 



Hal. Hal had been the youngest 
Hal would be only fifty-nine, or 
something like that. That wasn’t 
too old for a man, from what he 
had learned. 

He flicked his light on, unable 
to maintain full speed by the 
moonlight. The pointing finger 
of the other guided him down 
the slope to a worn, weed-cover- 
ed trail. It was already more 
than five miles from the entrance 
to the creche. 

“He was worried you might 
leave here before we could reach 
you,” Joe explained. “He knew 
the month was almost up, and 
it might take too long for me to 
bring him. He ordered me to 
leave him and go ahead alone. 
Sometimes now it is hard to 
know whether he means what he 
says, but this was a clear order.” 

“You’d have been wiser to 
stick to the car and drive all 
the way with him,” Sam sug- 
gested. He was forcing his way 
through a tangle of underbrush, 
wondering how much farther 
they had to go. 

“There was no car,” Joe said. 
“I can’t drive one now. My arms 
sometimes stop working, and it 
would be dangerous to drive. I 
found a little wagon and drag- 
ged him behind me on that un- 
til we got here.” 

Sam took his eyes off the trail 
to stare at Joe’s battered legs. 
Joe had almost worn out his 



188 



GALAXY 



body. But in other ways, he must 
have developed a great deal since 
the days on the Moon. Time, 
experience and the companion- 
ship of men had shaped him far 
beyond what Sam remembered. 

Then they were in a little 
hollow beside a brook, and 
there was a small tent pitched 
beside a cart. Sam released Joe 
and headed for the shelter. 
Moonlight broke through the 
trees and fell on the drawn suf- 
fering of a human face just in- 
side the tent. 

It took long study to find 
familiar features. At first nothing 
seemed right. Then Sam traced 
the jawline behind the long 
beard and gasped in recognition. 
“Dr. Smithers!” 

“Hello, Sam.” The eyes open- 
ed slowly, and a pain-racked 
smile stretched the lips briefly. 
“I was just dreaming about you. 
Thought you and Hal got lost 
in a crater. Better go shine up 
now. We’ll want you to sing for 
us tonight. You’re a good man, 
Sam, even if you are a robot. 
But you stay away too long out 
on those field trips.” 

Sam sighed softly. This was 
another reality he could recog- 
nize only from fiction. But he 
nodded. “Yes, Chief. It’s all 
right now.” 

He began singing softly, the 
song about a Lady Greensleeves. 
A smile flickered over Smithers’ 



lips again, and the eyes closed. 

Then abruptly they snapped 
open, and Smithers tried to sit 
up. “Sam! You really are Sami 
How’d you get here?” 

J oe had been fussing over a 
little fire, drawing supplies 
from the cart. Now he hobbled 
up with a bowl of some broth 
and began trying to feed the 
man. Smithers swallowed a few 
mouthfuls dutifully, but his eyes 
remained on Sam. And he nod- 
ded as he heard the summary 
of the long struggle back to 
Earth. But when Sam told of 
the landing, he slumped back 
onto his pad. 

“I’m glad you made it. Glad 
I got a chance to see you again 
before I give up the last ghost 
on Earth. I couldn’t figure that 
radio signal Joe heard. Knew it 
couldn’t be a human call, but I 
never thought of you making it 
back to Earth. Should have had 
a brass band to welcome you.” 
He closed his eyes, but the 
weak voice went on. “Hal and 
Randy died. Pete suicided. I’m 
the only one left, Sam. We wait- 
ed up in the station three years, 
guessing what had happened 
here. Then we came down and 
tried to find somebody — any- 
body — to start the race over. 
But there weren’t any left. We 
covered every continent for thir- 
ty years. The robots got busted. 



TO AVENGE MAN 



189 



except for Joe here. Then we 
came back. And now I’m the 
last man. The last man on Earth 
heard a knock on the door — 
and it was Sam. It’s a better 
ending on the story than I ex- 
pected.” 

He slept fitfully after that, 
though Sam could hear him moan 
at times. It was cancer, according 
to what Joe knew, and there was 
no hope. 

Somehow, Joe had found a hos- 
pital with its equipment intact 
and books to study. The robot 
had taken Smithers there and 
tried to treat him with the equip- 
men, but it had been a losing 
battle. Then, when the mes- 
sage came, broadcast by the 
computer at Sam’s orders, Smith- 
ers had insisted on leaving. They 
had no radio capable of answer- 
ing, and little hope of finding a 
working transmitter in time, so 
Smithers had insisted they must 
come in person. In the hospital, 
the treatment might have given 
him a year more of life; but he 
had ordered Joe to leave, know- 
ing that he might not survive 
the trip. And now only his will 
seemed to keep the man alive. 
Joe had a few drugs to ease the 
pain, but that was all the help 
that could be given. 

During the long night, Joe told 
more of the long search for sur- 
vivors. It had been thorough. 
But they had found no trace of 



another living human being. The 
nerve gas had produced even- 
tual death by nerve damage, as 
well as the initial insanity that 
had killed many. 

“Who?” Sam asked bitterly. 
“What race did this?” 

J oe made a gesture of uncer- 
tainty. “They talked about 
that. Mr. Norman told me about 
it, too. He explained that men 
killed each other off. One side 
attacked this side, and then our 
side had to hit back, until no- 
body was left. But I don’t under- 
stand it.” 

“Do you believe it?” 

“No,” Joe answered. “Mr. 
Norman was always saying things 
I found he didn’t really mean. 
No man would do anything like 
this.” 

Sam nodded, and began telling 
his theories. At first Joe was 
doubtful. Then the little robot 
seemed convinced. He dredged 
up small confirming bits of in- 
formation from the long years 
of search. They weren’t impor- 
tant by themselves, but a few 
seemed to add to the total pic- 
ture. A sign cursed the “sky 
devils” in Borneo. There were 
odd bits from a sermon printed 
in Louisianna. And there were 
other vague hints at doom from 
beyond the Earth. 

Twice during the long night 
Smithers wakened, but he was ir- 



190 



GALAXY 



rational. Sam soothed him and 
sang to him, while Joe tried to 
give him nourishment that was 
loaded with morphine. Now even 
Sam could see that the man was 
near death. The pulse was 
thready and the breathing 
seemed too much for the worn 
body. 

In the morning, however, 
Smithers was rational again. He 
managed a smile. “Man goeth to 
his long home, and the mourn- 
ers won’t go about the streets this 
time. There won’t be any mourn- 
ers.” 

“There will be two,” Sam told 
him. 

“Yes.” Smithers thought it 
over and nodded. “That’s good, 
somehow. A man hates not be- 
ing missed. I guess you two will 
have to take on all the debts of 
the human race now.” 

His breath caught sharply in 
his throat, and he retched weak- 
ly. But he forced himself up on 
his elbows and looked out 
through the flap of the tent to- 
ward the hills that showed 
through the shrubbery and the 
blue of the sky beyond. 

“There are a lot of debts and 
a lot of broken promises, Sam, 
Joe.” he said. “Man had prom- 
ised to write some great things 
into the future of this universe. 
He was going to conquer the stars 
and even make a better scheme 
for everything. But he failed. 



He’s finished. He dies, and the 
universe won’t even know he’s 
gone.” 

“We’ll know,” Joe said softly. 

Smithers dropped back onto 
the pad. “Yeah. Maybe that 
helps. We had our faults, but I 
guess there must have been a 
lot of good in us, too — there had 
to be, if we could make two 
people like you. God, I’m tired!” 

He closed his eyes. A few min- 
utes later, Sam knew he was 
dead. 

nphe two robots waited to be 
sure, and then wrapped the 
body in the tent and buried it, 
while Sam recited the scraps of 
the burial service he had picked 
up from his reading. 

Sam sat down then where 
Smithers had died, staring at the 
world where no man would ever 
live again. And the knot in his 
brain complex grew stronger and 
colder. He could not see the stars 
in the light of the day. But he 
knew they were there. And some- 
where out there was the debt 
Smithers had given him — a debt 
of justice that had to be paid. 

Saucers, Boskone, the Eich — 
whatever they were, the evil 
alien monsters must be repaid to 
the last full measure for the foul- 
ness they had done and which 
man could no longer settle with 
them. 

Anger and hate grew slowly in 

191 



TO AVENGE MAN 



him against the enemy from the 
stars, until he could no longer 
contain his emotions. His radio 
message was almost a scream as 
he roused the computer. 

“You’ve got a thousand robot 
bodies waiting. Can you build 
brains for them, modelled after 
the records of my brain? Can you 
build them without the limits you 
used for later models? Do you 
have materials for that?” 

“Such a program is feasible,” 
the machine answered. 

“Then start — ” Sam began. But 
his eyes fell on the wreck of 
Joe’s body, and he modified his 
order. “No, save one body to re- 
place another robot I’ll bring you. 
Start work at once on all the 
others.” 

“The program is begun,” the 
machine agreed. 

Nine hundred and ninety-nine 
should be enough. They wouldn’t 
be just like him, Sam realized; 
DeMatre had said there was a 
random factor. But they would 
do. The first group could find 
raw materials for ten thousand 
more, and those for still more. 
There would be robots enough to 
study all the books men had left, 
and to begin the long trip out in- 
to space. 

This time, there would be more 
than a tape education for them. 
Sam would be there to tell them 
the story of man, the glory of 
the race, and the savage treach- 



ery that had robbed the universe 
of that rac$. They would learn 
that the universe held an enemy, 
a race of technological monsters 
that must be sought among the 
stars and exterminated to the 
last individual. 

They would comb the entire 
galaxy for that enemy if they 
had to. And someday, mankind’s 
debt of justice would be paid. 
Man would be avenged. 

Sam looked up at the sky and 
foreswore all robots for all time 
to that debt of vengeance.

T Tate spewed across the uni- 
verse in a high crusade. 
Metal ships leaped from star to 
star and hurtled across the im- 
mensities between the far-flung 
galaxies. The ships spawned in- 
cessantly, and with each went 
the holy image of their faith and 
the unsated and insatiable hun- 
ger of their hate. 

A thousand stars yielded the 
dead and ancient wreckage of 
races that had once achieved 
technology. Five hundred suns 
gave light to intelligent races — 
quiet, peaceful races with back- 
ward cultures. The great ships 
dropped onto their worlds and 
went away again, leaving peoples 
throughout the galaxies filled 
with gratitude and paying hom- 
age to the incredibly beautiful 



192 



GALAXY 



images of the supernal be : ng 
called Man. But still the quest 
went on. 

I n a great temple palace on the 
capital world of the Androm- 
eda Galaxy, Sam stared down 
at a long table piled with little 
scraps of evidence. One graceful 
finger of his lithe seventeenth 
body stirred some of the scraps 
and he bent closer to read what 
was left of the ancient writing. 
Then he looked up and across 
at the great scientist who had 
just returned from the ancient 
mother world of Earth, incred- 
ible light-years away. 

“That is how the human race 
died?” Sam asked quietly. “You 
are quite sure?” 

The scientist nodded. “Quite 
sure. Even with a hundred mil- 
lion workers, it took us fifty years 
to gather all this on Earth. It 
has been so badly scattered, so 
nearly ruined. But no truth from 
the past can be completely con- 
cealed from our present methods 
of research. Man died as I said.” 
Sam sighed softly and moved 
to the window. Outside it was 
summer, and the trees were in 
blossom, competing with the 
bright plumage of the birds 
brought from far Deneb. The 
gardens were a poem of color. 
He bent forward, sniffing the 
blended fragrance of the flowers. 
Strains of music came from the 



great Hall of Art that lifted its 
fairy beauty across the park. It 
was the eighth opus of their 
greatest living composer — an 
early work, but still magnificent 
in its reach and its ambition. 

For the moment his shoulders 
slumped faintly. His emotions 
blended with the half -bitter 
memories of other discoveries. 
There had been the first visit to 
Mars — a Mars where no John 
Carter could ever have fought 
green men for the hand of the 
incredible Dejah Thoris. There 
had been star after star, with no 
friendly Arisians, no gallant 
dragon-folk to join against the 
undiscovered menace of Boskone. 
And for a thousand years, as fic- 
tion paled before reality, there 
had been the growing doubt in 
his mind. Now the last effort to 
make himself believe the legend 
he had created was spent. 

“There is no Enemy now,” the 
scientist said from behind him. 
“There can be no doubt. Man 
was his own destroyer. He killed 
himself. In a sense, his race was 
the one we are sworn to kill.” 

S am leaned further out the win- 
dow. Below, the throng of 
busy, laughing people looked up 
at him and cheered. There were 
a dozen races in the park, min- 
gled with a majority of his 
people. He smiled and lifted his 
hand to them, then bent further 



TO AVENGE MAN

out, until he could just see the 
great statue of Man that reared 
heavenward over the central part 
of the temple palace. He sighed 
again and inclined his head, be- 
fore backing from the window. 

“How many know this besides 
you, Robert?” he asked. 

“None. It was gathered in too 
small fragments, until I could 
assemble it into a meaningful 
pattern.” 

Sam smiled at him. “Your 
work was well done, and there 
will be ways to reward you for it 
properly. But now I suggest that 
we bum this evidence.” 

“Burn it!” Robert’s voice rose. 
“Burn this evidence and shackle 
our race to superstition forever? 
Our entire lives have been 
shaped to fit a cult of vengeance. 
Now we can free ourselves. This 
is our heritage, Sam — we can 
be ourselves!” 

Sam ran his finger through the 
evidence again. There was pity 
in his mind for the scientist, but 
more for the strange race of man 
whose true nature had finally 
been revealed in fact. Man had 
missed owning the universe by 
so little! But the fates of that 
universe had conspired against 
him. The fates had offered two 
roads to intelligence. In one, 
there was the quiet growth that 
led to pastoral life and gentle 
pleasures, but somehow never 
got beyond its native planet. In 

194 



the other, chosen by man, intel- 
ligence grew from the aggression* 
of savagery and thrust the race 
ahead to great discoveries — while 
building the means to the inevit- 
able final aggression that must 
destroy itself utterly. 

Man had failed, like all other 
races grown from killing strains 
of animal life. But in dying, he 
had passed on part of his soul to 
another race that had been de- 
signed without his mighty pas- 
sions. Somehow he had passed 
on the driving anger of his spirit 
of his true children, the robots. 

And they had carried on. 

The robots had been a created 
race, a race designed only to 
serve, able to live in perfect 
peace and without ambition. 
They had owned no heritage. 
But through an accident of fic- 
tion and a few dying words, men 
had left them a rich heritage. 

Anger had carried them 
throughout the stars, and hatred 
had bridged the spaces between 
the galaxies. 

“You’re mistaken, Robert,” 
Sam said. “Vengeance is our her- 
itage. Burn .the evidence.” 

Most of the material was tin- 
der dry, and it caught fire at 
the first spark. For a few seconds, 
it was a seething pillar of 
flame. Then there was only a 
dark scar on the wood to show 
the true death of man.
