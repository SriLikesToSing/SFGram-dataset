HIT OR MYTH? 



TVTO DOUBT you don’t own a 

^ book called Foremost Films 
of 1938, assembled by Frank 
Vreeland and published by Pit- 
man. I do and I can’t account 
for it. Why 1938? Why not 1937 
or 1939? But that’s not the puz- 
zle. Since you don’t have a copy, 
I’ll give some listings that hint 
at the awesome secret I detect 
here. 

The Buccaneer (pirate Jean 
Lafitte and Andrew Jackson at 
New Orleans in the War of 
1812), with Fredric March, Akim 
Tamiroff, Walter Brennan. 

In Old Chicago (Mrs. O’Leary 
and her cow — name of Daisy, 
in case you’ve wondered — and 
the Chicago fire of 1871), star- 
ring Tyrone Power, Don Ameche, 
Brian Donlevy; Daisy gets no 
screen credit. 

Algiers (come wiz me to ze 
Casbah), with Charles Boyer, 
Hedy La Marr. 

Love Finds Andy Hardy (love 
finds Andy Hardy), with Mickey 
Rooney, Judy Garland and Lana 
Turner. 

Storm In A Teacup (a fight 
over an unlicensed mongrel 
changes the views of a dicta- 
torial candidate for Parliament 
and brings a couple together), 
with Vivien Leigh and Rex Har- 
rison. 



The Beachcomber (the rummy 
son of a vicar and the prim 
daughter of a drunkard convert 
each other and marry), with 
Charles Laughton, Elsa Lan- 
chester and Robert Newton. 

Happy Landing (American 
bandleader dances twice with 
Norwegian girl, which means 
they are engaged, according to 
local custom; he flees, she fol- 
lows, guess what), starring Sonja 
Henie, Don Ameche again, Ethel 
Merman, Cesar Romero. 

Mannequin (I’d need more 
than two pages to go into this 
plot!), with Joan Crawford and 
Spencer Tracy. 

Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars 
(one of the very few science fic- 
tion items in the book and it’s 
not hard to understand why; 
Mars is swiping the nitrogen from 
our atmosphere and reversing 
Genesis by turning people to 
clay), starring — who else? — 
Buster Crabbe. 

I realize this list sounds like a 
do-you-remember session, but 
that isn’t what I’m after at all. 
Though the plots have some sig- 
nificance, what I really want you 
to note is how many of these 
stars are around today, 17 years 
later! 

You don’t get the point? Well,

A Ticket to Tranai 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

Illustrated by CAVAT 



O NE FINE day in June, 
a tall, thin, intent, sober- 
ly dressed young man 
walked into the offices of the 
Transstellar Travel Agency. With- 
out a glance, he marched past 
the gaudy travel poster depicting 
the Harvest Feast on Mars. The 
enormous photomural of danc- 
ing forests on Triganium didn’t 
catch his eye. He ignored the 
somewhat suggestive painting of 
dawn-rites on Opiuchus II, and 
arrived at the desk of the book- 
ing agent. 

“I would like to book passage 
to Tranai,” the young man said. 

The agent closed his copy 
of Necessary Inventions and 
frowned. “Tranai? Tranai? Is 
that one of the moons of Kent 
IV?” 

“It is not,” the young man 
said. “Tranai is a planet, revolv- 
ing around a sun of the same 
name. I want to book passage 
there.” 

“Never heard of it.” The agent

Goodman found that Tranai was a certified 
genuine utopia. All its problems had been 
solved . but with what devastating logic!

pulled down a star catalogue, a 
simplified star chart, and a copy 
of Lesser Space Routes. 

“Well, now,” he said finally. 
“You learn something new every 
day. You want to book passage 
to Tranai, Mister — ” 

“Goodman. Marvin Goodman.” 
“Goodman. Well, it seems that 
Tranai is about as far from Earth 
as one can get and still be in the 
Milky Way. Nobody goes there.” 
“I know. Can you arrange pas- 
sage for me?” Goodman asked, 
with a hint of suppressed excite- 
ment in his voice. 

The agent shook his head. “Not 
a chance. Even the non-skeds 
don’t go that far.” 

“How close can you get me?” 

T HE AGENT gave him a win- 
ning smile. “Why bother? I 
can send you to a world that’ll 
have everything this Tranai place 
has, with the additional advan- 
tages of proximity, bargain rates, 
decent hotels, tours — ” 

“I’m going to Tranai,” Good- 
man said grimly. 

“But there’s no way of getting 
there,” the agent explained pa- 
tiently. “What is it you expected 
to find? Perhaps I could help.” 
“You can help by booking me 
as far as — ” 

“Is it adventure?” the agent 
asked, quickly sizing up Good- 
man’s unathletic build and schol- 
arly stoop. “Let me suggest Afri- 

8 



canus II, a dawn-age world filled 
with savage tribes, saber-tooths, 
man-eating ferns, quicksand, ac- 
tive volcanoes, pterodactyls and 
all the rest. Expeditions leave 
New York every five days and 
they combine the utmost in dan- 
ger with absolute safety. A dino- 
saur head guaranteed or your 
money refunded.” 

“Tranai,” Goodman said. 
“Hmm.” The clerk looked ap- 
praisingly at Goodman’s set ,’ips 
and uncompromising eyes. “Per- 
haps you are tired of the puri- 
tanical restrictions of Earth? 
Then let me suggest a trip to 
Almagordo III, the Pearl of the 
Southern Ridge Belt. Our ten 
day all-expense plan includes a 
trip through the mysterious Al- 
magordian Casbah, visits to eight 
nightclubs (first drink on us), a 
trip to a zintal factory, where 
you can buy genuine zintal belts, 
shoes and pocketbooks at phe- 
nomenal savings, and a tour 
through two distilleries. The girls 
of Almagordo are beautiful, viva- 
cious and refreshingly naive. 
They consider the Tourist the 
highest and most desirable type 
of human being. Also — ” 

“Tranai,” Goodman said. “How 
close can you get me?” 

Sullenly the clerk extracted a 
strip of tickets. “You can take 
the Constellation Queen as far as 
Legis II and transfer to the Ga- 
lactic Splendor, which will take 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you to Oume. Then you’ll have 
to board a local, which, after stop- 
ping at Machang, Inchang, Pank- 
ang, Lekung and Oyster, will 
leave you at Tung-Bradar IV, if 
it doesn’t break down en route. 
Then a non-sked will transport 
you past the Galactic Whirl (if 
it gets past) to Aloomsridgia, 
from which the mail ship will 
take you to Bellismoranti. I be- 
lieve the mail ship is still func- 
tioning. That brings you about 
halfway. After that, you’re on 
your own.” 

“Fine,” Goodman said. “Can 
you have my forms made out by 
this afternoon?” 

The clerk nodded. “Mr. Good- 
man,” he asked in despair, “just 
what sort of place is this Tranai 
supposed to be?” 

Goodman smiled a beatific 
smile. “A utopia,” he said. 

IVJARVIN Goodman had lived 
most of his life in Seakirk, 
New Jersey, a town controlled by 
one political boss or another for 
close to fifty years. Most of Sea- 
kirk’s inhabitants were indiffer- 
ent to the spectacle of corruption 
in high places and low, the 
gambling, the gang wars, the teen- 
age drinking. They were used to 
the sight of their roads crumbl- 
ing, their ancient water mains 
bursting, their power plants 
breaking down, their decrepit old 
buildings falling apart, while the 



bosses built bigger homes, longer 
swimming pools and warmer 
stables. People were used to it. 
But not Goodman. 

A natural-born crusader, he 
wrote expose articles that were 
never published, sent letters to 
Congress that were never read, 
stumped for honest candidates 
who were never elected, and or- 
ganized the League for Civic 
Improvement, the People Against 
Gangsterism, the Citizen’s Union 
for an Honest Police Force, the 
Association Against Gambling, 
the Committee for Equal Job 
Opportunities for Women, and a 
dozen others. 

Nothing came of his efforts. 
The people were too apathetic 
to care. The politicoes simply 
laughed at him, and Goodman 
couldn’t stand being laughed at. 
Then, to add to his troubles, his 
fiancee jilted him for a noisy 
young man in a loud sports 
jacket who had no redeeming 
feature other than a controlling 
interest in the Seakirk Construc- 
tion Corporation. 

It was a shattering blow. The 
girl seemed unaffected by the 
fact that the SCC used dispro- 
portionate amounts of sand in 
their concrete and shaved whole 
inches from the width of their 
steel girders. As she put it, “Gee 
whiz, Marvie, so what? That’s 
how things are. You gotta be 
realistic.” 



A TICKET TO TRANA

Goodman had no intention of 
being realistic. He immediately 
repaired to Eddie’s Moonlight 
Bar, where, between drinks, he 
began to contemplate the attrac- 
tions of a grass shack in the green 
hell of Venus. 

An erect, hawk-faced old man 
entered the bar. Goodman could 
tell he was a spacer by his grav- 
ity-bound gait, his pallor, his radi- 
ation scars and his far-piercing 
gray eyes. 

“A Tranai Special, Sam,” the 
old spacer told the bartender. 

“Coming right up, Captain 
Savage, sir,” the bartender said. 

“Tranai?” Goodman murmured 
involuntarily. 

“Tranai,” the captain said. 
“Never heard of it, did you, 
sonny?” 

“No, sir,” Goodman confessed. 

“Well, sonny,” Captain Savage 
said, “I’m feeling a mite wordy 
tonight, so I’ll tell you a tale of 
Tranai the Blessed, out past the 
Galactic Whirl.” 

The captain’s eyes grew misty 
and a smile softened the grim 
line of his lips. 

“We were iron men in steel 
ships in those days. Me and 
Johnny Cavanaugh and Frog 
Larsen would have blasted to hell 
itself for half a load of terganium. 
Aye, and shanghaied Beelzebub 
for a wiper if we were short of 
men. Those were the days when 
space scurvy took every third 

10 



man, and the ghost of Big Dan 
McClintock haunted the space- 
ways. Moll Gann still operated 
the Red Rooster Inn out on 
Asteroid 342-AA, asking five hun- 
dred Earth dollars for a glass of 
beer, and getting it too, there 
being no other place within ten 
billion miles. In those days, the 
Scarbies were still cutting up 
along Star Ridge and ships bound 
for Prodengum had to run the 
Swayback Gantlet. So you can 
imagine how I felt, sonny, when 
one fine day I came upon Tranai.” 

G OODMAN listened as the old 
captain limned a picture of 
the great days, of frail ships 
against an iron sky, ships outward 
bound, forever outward, to the 
far limits of the Galaxy. 

And there, at the edge of the 
Great Nothing, was Tranai. 

Tranai, where The Way had 
been found and men were no 
longer bound to The Wheel! 
Tranai the Bountiful, a peaceful, 
creative, happy society, not saints 
or ascetics, not intellectuals, but 
ordinary people who had achieved 
utopia. 

For an hour, Captain Savage 
spoke of the multiform marvels 
of Tranai. After finishing his 
story, he complained of a dry 
throat. Space throat, he called it, 
and Goodman ordered him an- 
other Tranai Special and one for 
himself. Sipping the exotic, green- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gray mixture, Goodman too was 
lost in the dream. 

Finally, very gently, he asked, 
“Why don’t you go back, Cap- 
tain?” 

The old man shook his head. 
“Space gout. I’m grounded for 
good. We didn’t know much 
about modern medicine in those 
days. All I’m good for now is a 
landsman’s job.” 

“What job do you have?” 

“I’m a foreman for the Seakirk 
Construction Corporation,” the 
old man sighed. “Me, that once 
commanded a fifty-tube clipper. 
The way those people make con- 
crete. Shall we - have another 
short one in honor of beautiful 
Tranai?” 

They had several short ones. 
When Goodman left the bar, his 
mind was made up. Somewhere 
in the Universe, the modus vi- 
vendi had been found, the work- 
ing solution to Man’s old dream 
of perfection. 

He could settle for nothing 
less. 

The next day, he quit his job 
as designer at the East Coast 
Robot Works and drew his life 
savings out of the bank. 

He was going to Tranai. 

E BOARDED the Constella- 
tion Queen for Legis II and 
took the Galactic Splendor to

ang, Inchang, Pankang, Lekung 

A TICKET TO TRANAI 



and Oyster — dreary little places 
— he reached Tung-Bradar IV. 
Without incident, he passed the 
Galactic Whirl and finally 
reached Bellismoranti, where the 
influence of Terra ended. 

For an exorbitant fee, a local 
spaceline took him to Dvasta II. 
From there, a freighter trans- 
ported him past Seves, Olgo and 
Mi, to the double planet Mvanti. 
There he was bogged down for 
three months and used the time 
to take a hypnopedic course in 
the Tranaian language. At last 
he hired a bush pilot to take him 
to Ding. 

On Ding, he was arrested as a 
Higastomeritreian , spy, but man- 
aged to escape in the cargo of 
an ore rocket bound for g’Moree. 
At g’Moree, he was treated for 
frostbite, heat poisoning and su- 
perficial radiation burns, and at 
last arranged passage to Tranai. 

He could hardly believe it 
when the ship slipped past the 
moons Doe and Ri, to land at 
Port Tranai. 

After the airlocks opened, 
Goodman found himself in a state 
of profound depression. Part of 
it was plain letdown, inevitable 
after a journey such as his. But 
more than that, he was suddenly 
terrified that Tranai might turn 
out to be a fraud. 

He had crossed the Galaxy on 
the basis of an old spaceman’s 
yarn. But now it all seemed less 

11 




likely. Eldorado was a more prob- 
able place than the Tranai he 
expected to find. 

He disembarked. Port Tranai 
seemed a pleasant enough town. 
The streets were filled with peo- 
ple and the shops were piled high 
with goods. The men he passed 
looked much like humans any- 
where. The women were quite 
attractive. 

But there was something 
strange here, something subtly 
yet definitely wrong, something 
alien. It took a moment before 
he could puzzle it out. 

Then he realized that there 
were at least ten men for every 
woman in sight. And stranger 
still, practically all the women he 
saw apparently were under eight- 
een or over thirty-five. 

What had happened to the 
nineteen-to-thirty-five age group? 
Was there a taboo on their ap- 
pearing in public? Had a plague 
struck them? 

He would just have to wait 
and find out. 

He went to the Idrig Build- 
ing, where all Tranai’s govern- 
mental functions were carried 
out, and presented himself at the 
office of the Extraterrestrials 
Minister. He was admitted at 
once. 

The office was small and clut- 
tered, with strange blue blotches 
on the wallpaper. What struck 
Goodman at once was a high- 

12 



powered rifle complete with si- 
lencer and telescopic sight, hang- 
ing ominously from one wall. He 
had no time to speculate on this, 
for the Minister bounded out of 
his chair and vigorously shook 
Goodman’s hand. 

r I ''HE MINISTER was a stout, 
jolly man of about fifty. 
Around his neck he wore a small 
medallion stamped with the 
Tranian seal — a bolt of light- 
ning splitting an ear of corn. 
Goodman assumed, correctly, 
that this was an official seal of 
office. 

“Welcome to Tranai,” the 
minister said heartily. He pushed 
a pile of papers from a chair and 
motioned Goodman to sit down. 

“Mister Minister — ” Goodman 
began, in formal Tranian. 

“Den Melith is the name. Call 
me Den. “We’re all quite infor- 
mal around here. Put your feet 
up on the desk and make your- 
self at home. Cigar?” 

“No, thank you,” Goodman 
said, somewhat taken back. “Mis- 
ter — ah — Den, I have come 
from Terra, a planet you may 
have heard of.” 

“Sure I have,” said Melith. 
“Nervous, hustling sort of place, 
isn’t it? No offense intended, of 
course.” 

“Of course. That’s exactly how 
I feel about it. The reason I came 
here — ” Goodman hesitated, hop- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing he wouldn’t sound too ridicu- 
lous. “Well, I heard certain stories 
about Tranai. Thinking them 
over now, they seem preposter- 
ous. But if you don’t mind, I’d 
like to ask you — ” 

“Ask anything,” Melith said 
expansively. “You’ll get a straight 
answer.” 

“Thank you. I heard that there 
has been no war of any sort on 
Tranai for four hundred years.” 
“Six hundred,” Melith correct- 
ed. “And none in sight.” 

“Someone told me that there 
is no crime on Tranai.” 

“None whatsoever.” 

“And therefore no police force 
or courts, no judges, sheriffs, 
marshals, executioners, truant of- 
ficers or government investiga- 
tors. No prisons, reformatories or 
other places of detention.” 

“We have no need of them,” 
Melith explained, “since we have 
no crime.” 

“I have heard,” said Goodman, 
“that there is no poverty on 
Tranai.” 

“None that I ever heard of,” 
Melith said cheerfully. “Are you 
sure you won’t have a cigar?” 
“No, thank you.” Goodman 
was leaning forward eagerly now. 
“I understand that you have 
achieved a stable economy with- 
out resorting to socialistic, com- 
munistic, fascistic or bureaucratic 
practices.” 

“Certainly,” Melith said. 



“That yours is, in fact, a free 
enterprise society, where individ- 
ual initiative flourishes and gov- 
ernmental functions are kept to 
an absolute minimum.” 

M ELITH nodded. “By and 
large, the government con- 
cerns itself with minor regulatory 
matters, care of the aged and 
beautifying the landscape.” 

“Is it true that you have dis- 
covered a method of wealth dis- 
tribution without resorting to 
governmental intervention, with- 
out even taxation, based entirely 
upon individual choice?” Good- 
man challenged. 

“Oh, yes, absolutely.” 

“Is it true that there is no cor- 
ruption in any phase of the 
Tranaian government?” 

“None,” Melith said. “I sup- 
pose that’s why we have a hard 
time finding men to hold public 
office.” 

“Then Captain Savage was 
right!” Goodman cried, unable to 
control himself any longer. “This 
is utopia!” 

“We like it,” Melith said. 
Goodman took a deep breath 
and asked, “May I stay here?” 
“Why not?” Melith pulled out 
a form. “We have no restrictions 
on immigration. Tell me, what is 
your occupation?” 

“On Earth, I was a robot de- 
signer.” 

“Plenty of openings in that.” 



A TICKET TO TRANAI

Melith started to fill in the form. 
His pen emitted a blob of ink. 
Casually, the minister threw the 
pen against the wall, where it 
shattered, adding another blue 
blotch to the wallpaper. 

“We’ll make out the paper 
some other time,” he said. “I’m 
not in the mood now.” He leaned 
back in his chair. “Let me give 
you a word of advice. Here on 
Tranai, we feel that we have 
come pretty close to utopia, as 
you call it. But ours is not a 
highly organized state. We have 
no complicated set of laws. We 
live by observance of a number 
of unwritten laws, or customs, as 
you might call them. You will 
discover what they are. You 
would be advised — although 
certainly not ordered — to fol- 
low them." 

“Of course I will,” Goodman 
exclaimed. “I can assure you, sir, 
I have no intention of endanger- 
ing any phase of your paradise.” 

“Oh, I wasn’t worried about 
us,” Melith said with an amused 
smile. “It was your own safety I 
was considering. Perhaps my 
wife has some further advice for 
you.” 

TIE PUSHED a large red but- 
ton on his desk. Immediate- 
ly there was a bluish haze. The 
haze solidified, and in a moment 
Goodman saw a handsome young 
woman standing before him. 

14 



“Good morning, my dear,” she 
said to Melith. 

“It’s afternoon,” Melith in- 
formed her. “My dear, this young 
man came all the way from Earth 
to live on Tranai. I gave him the 
usual advice. Is there anything 
else we can do for him?” 

Mrs. Melith thought for a mo- 
ment, then asked Goodman, “Are 
you married?” 

“No, ma’am,” Goodman an- 
swered. 

“In that case, he should meet 
a nice girl,” Mrs. Melith told her 
husband. “Bachelordom is not en- 
couraged on Tranai, although 
certainly not prohibited. Let me 
see. How about that cute Dri- 
ganti girl?” 

“She’s engaged,” Melith said. 

“Really? Have I been in stasis 
that long? My dear, it’s not too 
thoughtful of you.” 

“I was busy,” Melith said 
apologetically. 

“How about Mihna Vensis?” 

“Not his type.” 

“Janna Vley?” 

“Perfect!” Melith winked at 
Goodman. “A most attractive 
little lady.” He found a new pen 
in his desk, scribbled an address 
and handed it to Goodman. “My 
wife will telephone her to be 
expecting you tomorrow eve- 
ning.” 

“And do come around for din- 
ner some night,” said Mrs. Melith. 

“Delighted,” Goodman replied, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in a complete daze. 

“It’s been nice meeting you,” 
Mrs. Melith said. Her husband 
pushed the red button. The blue 
haze formed and Mrs. Melith 
vanished. 

“Have to close up now,” said 
Melith, glancing at his watch. 
“Can’t work overtime — people 
might start talking. Drop in some 
day and we’ll make out those 
forms. You really should call on 
Supreme President Borg, too, at 
the National Mansion. Or possi- 
bly he’ll call on you. Don’t let 
the old fox put anything over on 
you. And don’t forget about 
Janna.” He winked roguishly and 
escorted Goodman to the door. 

In a few moments, Goodman 
found himself alone on the side- 
walk. He had reached utopia, he 
told himself, a real, genuine, sure- 
enough utopia. 

But there were some very puz- 
zling things about it. 

G OODMAN ate dinner at a 
small restaurant and checked 
in at a nearby hotel. A cheerful 
bellhop showed him to his room, 
where Goodman stretched out 
immediately on the bed. Wearily 
he rubbed his eyes, trying to sort 
out his impressions. 

So much had happened to him, 
all in one day! And so much was 
bothering him. The ratio of men 
to women, for example. He had 
meant to ask Melith about that. 



But Melith might not be the 
man to ask, for there were some 
curious things about him. Like 
throwing his pen against the wall. 
Was that the act of a mature, 
responsible official? And Melith’s 
wife . 

Goodman knew that Mrs. Me- 
lith had come out of a derrsin 
stasis field; he had recognized 
the characteristic blue haze. The 
derrsin was used on Terra, too. 
Sometimes there were good medi- 
cal reasons for suspending all 
activity, all growth, all decay. 
Suppose a patient had a desper- 
ate need for a certain serum, pro- 
curable only on Mars. Simply 
project the person into stasis 
until the serum could arrive. 

But on Terra, only a licensed 
doctor could operate the field. 
There were strict penalties for 
its misuse. 

He had never heard of keep- 
ing one’s wife in one. 

Still, if all the wives on Tranai 
were kept in stasis, that would 
explain the absence of the nine- 
teen-to-thirty-five age group and 
would account for the ten-to-one 
ratio of men to women. 

But what was the reason for 
this technological purdah? 

And something else was on 
Goodman’s mind, something quite 
insignificant, but bothersome all 
the same. 

That rifle on Melith’s wall. 

Did he hunt game with it? 



A TICKET TO TRANA 



15 



Pretty big game, then. Target 
practice? Not with a telescopic 
sight. Why the silencer? Why 
did he keep it in his office? 

But these were minor matters, 
Goodman decided, little local 
idiosyncracies which would be- 
come clear when he had lived a 
while on Tranai. He couldn’t ex- 
pect immediate and complete 
comprehension of what was, after 
all, an alien planet. 

E WAS JUST beginning to 
doze off when he heard a 
knock at his door. 

“Come in,” he called. 

A small, furtive, gray-faced 
man hurried in and closed the 
door behind him. “You’re the 
man from Terra, aren’t you?” 
“That’s right.” 

“I figured you’d come here,” 
the little man said, with a pleased 
smile. “Hit it right the first time. 
Going to stay on Tranai?” 

“I’m here for good.” 

“Fine,” the man said. “How 
would you like to become Su- 
preme President?” 

“Huh?” 

“Good pay, easy hours, only 
a one-year term. You look like a 
public-spirited type,” the man 
said sunnily. “How about it?” 
Goodman hardly knew what 
to answer. “Do you mean,” he 
asked incredulously, “that you 
offer the highest office in the land 
so casually?” 

16 



“What do you mean, casually?” 
the little man spluttered. “Do you 
think we offer the Supreme 
Presidency to just anybody? It’s 
a great honor to be asked.” 

“I didn’t mean — ” 

“And you, as a Terran, are 
uniquely suited.” 

“Why?” 

“Well, it’s common knowledge 
that Terrans derive pleasure from 
ruling. We Tranians don’t, that’s 
all. Too much trouble.” 

As simple as that. The re- 
former blood in Goodman began 
to boil. Ideal as Tranai was, there 
was undoubtedly room for im- 
provement. He had a sudden 
vision of himself as ruler of 
utopia, doing the great task of 
making perfection even better. 
But caution stopped him from 
agreeing at once. Perhaps the 
man was a crackpot. 

“Thank you for asking me,” 
Goodman said. “I’ll have to think 
it over. Perhaps I should talk 
with the present incumbent and 
find out something about the na- 
ture of the work.” 

“Well, why do you think I’m 
here?” the little man demanded. 
“I’m Supreme President Borg.” 
Only then did Goodman notice 
the official medallion around the 
little man’s neck. 

“Let me know your decision. 
I’ll be at the National Mansion.” 
He shook Goodman’s hand, and 
left. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Goodman waited five minutes, 
then rang for the bellhop. “Who 
was that man?” 

“That was Supreme President 
Borg,” the bellhop told him. “Did 
you take the job?” 

Goodman shook his head slow- 
ly. He suddenly realized that he 
had a great deal to learn about 
Tranai. 

HE NEXT morning, Good- 
man listed the various robot 
factories of Port Tranai in alpha- 
betical order and went out in 
search of a job. To his amaze- 
ment, he found one with no 
trouble at all, at the very first 
place he looked. The great Abbag 
Home Robot Works signed him 
on after only a cursory glance at 
his credentials. 

His new employer, Mr. Abbag, 
was short and fierce-looking, with 
a great mane of white hair and 
an air of tremendous personal 
energy. 

“Glad to have a Terran on 
board,” Abbag said. “I understand 
you’re an ingenious people and 
we certainly need some ingenuity 
around here. I’ll be honest with 
you, Goodman — I’m hoping to 
profit by your alien viewpoint. 
We’ve reached an impasse.” 

“Is it a production problem?” 
Goodman asked. 

“I’ll show you.” Abbag led 
Goodman through the factory, 
around the Stamping Room, 

A TICKET TO TRANAI 



Heat-Treat, X-ray Analysis, Final 
Assembly and to the Testing 
Room. This room was laid out 
like a combination kitchen-living 
room. A dozen robots were lined 
up against one wall. 

“Try one out,” Abbag said. 

Goodman walked up to the 
nearest robot and looked at its 
controls. They were simple 
enough; self-explanatory, in fact. 
He put the machine through a 
standard repertoire : picking up 
objects, washing pots and pans, 
setting a table. The robot’s re- 
sponses were correct enough, but 
maddeningly slow. On Earth, 
such sluggishness had been ironed 
out a hundred years ago. Appar- 
ently they were behind the times 
here on Tranai. 

“Seems pretty slow,” Goodman 
commented cautiously. 

“You’re right,” Abbag said. 
“Damned slow. Personally, I 
think it’s about right. But Con- 
sumer Research indicates that 
our customers want it slower 
still.” 

“Huh?” 

“Ridiculous, isn’t it?” Abbag 
asked moodily. “We’ll lose money 
if we slow it down any more. 
Take a look at its guts.” 

Goodman opened the back 
panel and blinked at the maze 
of wiring within. After a moment, 
he was able to figure it out. The 
robot was built like a modern 
Earth machine, with the usual 

17 




V 



inexpensive high-speed circuits. 
But special signal-delay relays, 
impulse-rejection units and step- 
down gears had been installed. 

“Just tell me,” Abbag demand- 
ed angrily, “how can we slow it 
down any more without building 
the thing a third bigger and twice 
as expensive? I don’t know what 
kind of a disimprovement they’ll 
be asking for next.” 

G OODMAN was trying to ad- 
just his thinking to the con- 
cept of disimproving a machine. 

On Earth, the plants were 
always trying to build robots 
with faster, smoother, more accu- 
rate responses. He had never 
found any reason to question the 
wisdom of this. He still didn’t. 

“And as if that weren’t 
enough,” Abbag complained, “the 
new plastic we developed for this 
particular model has catalyzed or 
some damned thing. Watch.” 

He drew back his foot and 
kicked the robot in the middle. 
The plastic bent like a sheet of 
tin. He kicked again. The plastic 
bent still further and the robot 
began to click and flash pathetic- 
ally. A third kick shattered the 
case. The robot’s innards explod- 
ed in spectacular fashion, scat- 
tering over the floor. 

“Pretty flimsy,” Goodman said. 
“Not flimsy enough. It’s sup- 
posed to fly apart on the first 
kick. Our customers won’t get 



any satisfaction out of stubbing 
their toes on its stomach all day. 
But tell me, how am I supposed 
to produce a plastic that’ll take 
normal wear and tear — we don’t 
want these things falling apart 
accidentally — and still go to 
pieces when a customer wants it 
to?” 

“Wait a minute,” Goodman 
protested. “Let me get this 
straight. You purposely slow 
these robots down so they will 
irritate people enough to destroy 
them?” 

Abbag raised both eyebrows. 
“Of course!” 

“Why?” 

“You are new here,” Abbag 
said. “Any child knows that. It’s 
fundamental.” 

“I’d appreciate it if you’d ex- 
plain.” 

Abbag sighed. “Well, first of 
all, you are undoubtedly aware 
that any mechanical contrivance 
is a source of irritation. Human- 
kind has a deep and abiding dis- 
trust of machines. Psychologists 
call it the instinctive reaction of 
life to pseudo-life. Will you go 
along with me on that?” 

1%/T ARVIN Goodman remem- 
bered all the anxious litera- 
ture he had read about machines 
revolting, cybernetic brains tak- 
ing over the world, androids on 
the march, and the like.'' He 
thought of humorous little news- 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



paper items about a man shoot- 
ing his television set, smashing 
his toaster against the wall, “get- 
ting even” with his car. He re- 
membered all the robot jokes, 
with their undertone of deep 
hostility. 

“I guess I can go along on 
that,” said Goodman. 

“Then allow me to restate the 
proposition,” Abbag said pedan- 
tically. “Any machine is a source 
of irritation. The better a ma- 
chine operates, the stronger the 
irritation. So, by extension, a per- 
fectly operating machine is a 
focal point for frustration, loss of 
self-esteem, undirected resent- 
ment — ■” 

“Hold on there!” Goodman ob- 
jected. “I won’t go that far!” 

“ — and schizophrenic fanta- 
sies,” Abbag continued inexorably. 
“But machines are necessary to 
an advanced economy. Therefore 
the best human solution is to 
have malfunctioning ones.” 

“I don’t see that at all.” 

“It’s obvious. On Terra, your 
gadgets work close to the opti- 
mum, producing inferiority feel- 
ings in their operators. But 
unfortunately you have a masoch- 
istic tribal tabu against destroy- 
ing them. Result? Generalized 
anxiety in the presence of the 
sacrosanct and unhumanly effi- 
cient Machine, and a search for 
an aggression-object, usually a 
wife or friend. A very poor state 



of affairs. Oh, it’s efficient, I sup- 
pose, in terms of robot-hour 
production, but very inefficient 
in terms of long-range health and 
well-being.” 

“I’m not sure — ” 

“The human is an anxious 
beast. Here on Tranai, we direct 
anxiety toward this particular 
point and let it serve as an outlet 
for a lot of other frustrations as 
well. A man’s had enough — 
blam! He kicks hell out of his 
robot. There’s an immediate and 
therapeutic discharge of feeling, 
a valuable — and valid — sense 
of superiority over mere machin- 
ery, a lessening of general tension, 
a healthy flow of adrenin into the 
bloodstream, and a boost to the 
industrial economy of Tranai, 
since he’ll go right out and buy 
another robot. And what, after 
all, has he done? He hasn’t beaten 
his wife, suicided, declared a war, 
invented a new weapon, or in- 
dulged in any of the other more 
common modes of aggression- 
resolution. He has simply 
smashed an inexpensive robot 
which he can replace immedi- 
ately.” 

“I guess it’ll take me a little 
time to understand,” Goodman 
admitted. 

“Of course it will. I’m sure 
you’re going to be a valuable 
man here, Goodman. Think over 
what I’ve said and try to figure 
out some inexpensive way of dis- 



A TICKET TO TRANAI 



T9 



improving this robot.” 

Goodman pondered the prob- 
lem for the rest of the day, but 
he couldn’t immediately adjust 
his thinking to the idea of pro- 
ducing an inferior machine. It 
seemed vaguely blasphemous. He 
knocked off work at five-thirty, 
dissatisfied with himself, but de- 
termined to do better — or worse, 
depending on viewpoint and con- 
ditioning. 

A FTER A quick and lonely 
supper, Goodman decided to 
call on Janna Vley. He didn’t 
want to spend the evening alone 
with his thoughts and he was in 
desperate need of finding some- 
thing pleasant, simple and un- 
complicated in this complex 
utopia. Perhaps this Janna would 
be the answer. 

The Vley home was only a 
dozen blocks away and he de- 
cided to walk. 

The basic trouble was that he 
had had his own idea of what 
utopia would be like and it was 
difficult adjusting his thinking to 
the real thing. He had imagined 
a pastoral setting, a planetful of 
people in small, quaint villages, 
walking around in flowing robes 
and being very wise and gentle 
and understanding. Children who 
played in the golden sunlight, 
young folk danced in the village 
square . 

Ridiculous! He had pictured a 



tableau rather than a scene, a 
series of stylized postures instead 
of the ceaseless movement of life. 
Humans could never live that 
way, even assuming they wanted 
to. If they could, they would no 
longer be humans. 

He reached the Vley house 
and paused irresolutely outside. 
What was he getting himself into 
now? What alien — although in- 
dubitably utopian — customs 
would he run into? 

He almost turned away. But 
the prospect of a long night alone 
in his hotel room was singularly 
unappealing. Gritting his teeth, 
he rattg the bell. 

A red-haired, middle-aged man 
of medium height opened the 
door. “Oh, you must be that Ter- 
ran fellow. Janna’s getting ready. , 
Come in and meet the wife.” 

He escorted Goodman into a 
pleasantly furnished living room 
and pushed a red button on the 
wall. Goodman wasn’t startled 
this time by the bluish derrsin 
haze. After all, the manner in 
which Tranaians treated their 
women was their own business. 

A handsome woman of about 
twenty-eight appeared from the 
haze. 

“My dear,” Vley said, “this is 
the Terran, Mr. Goodman.” 

“So pleased to meet you,” Mrs. 
Vley said. “Can I get you a 
drink?” 

Goodman nodded. Vley point- 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ed out a comfortable chair. In a 
moment, Mrs. Vley brought in a 
tray of frosted drinks and sat 
down. 

“So you’re from Terra,” said 
Mr. Vley. “Nervous, hustling sort 
of place, isn’t it? People always 
on the go?” 

“Yes, I suppose it is,” Good- 
man replied. 

“Well, you’ll like it here. We 
know how to live. It’s all a matter 
of — ” 

There was a rustle of skirts on 
the stairs. Goodman got to his 
feet. 

“Mr. Goodman, this is our 
daughter Janna,” Mrs. Vley said. 

G OODMAN noted at once that 
Janna’s hair was the exact 
color of the supernova in Circe, 
her eyes were that deep, unbe- 
lievable blue of the autumn sky 
over Algo II, her lips were the 
tender pink of a Scarsclott- 
Turner jet stream, her nose — 
But he had run out of as- 
tronomical comparisons, which 
weren’t suitable anyhow. Janna 
was a slender and amazingly 
pretty blonde girl and Goodman 
was suddenly very glad he had 
crossed the Galaxy and come to 
Tranai. 

“Have a good time, children,” 
Mrs. Vley said. 

“Don’t come in too late,” Mr. 
Vley told Janna. 

Exactly as parents said on 



Earth to their children. 

There was nothing exotic about 
the date. They went to an inex- 
pensive night club, danced, drank 
a little, talked a lot. Goodman 
was amazed at their immediate 
rapport. Janna agreed with every- 
thing he said. It was refreshing 
to find intelligence in so pretty 
a girl. 

She was impressed, almost 
overwhelmed, by the dangers he 
had faced in crossing the Galaxy. 
She had always known that Ter- 
rans were adventurous (though 
nervous) types, but the risks 
Goodman had taken passed all 
understanding. 

She shuddered when he spoke 
of the deadly Galactic Whirl and 
listened wide-eyed to his tales of 
running the notorious Swayback 
Gantlet, past the bloodthirsty 
Scarbies who were still cutting 
up along Star Ridge and infesting 
the hell holes of Prodengum. As 
Goodman put it, Terrans were 
iron men in steel ships, exploring 
the edges of the Great Nothing. 

Janna didn’t even speak until 
Goodman told of paying five 
hundred Terran dollars for a 
glass of beer at Moll Gann’s Red 
Rooster Inn on Asteroid 342-AA. 

“You must have been very 
thirsty,” she said thoughtfully. 

“Not particularly,” Goodman 
said. “Money just didn’t mean 
much out there.” 

“Oh. But wouldn’t it have been 



A TICKET TO TRANAI 



21 



better to have saved it? I mean 
someday you might have a wife 
and children — ” She blushed. 

Goodman said coolly, “Well, 
that part of my life is over. I’m 
going to marry and settle down 
right here on Tranai.” 

“How nice!” she cried. 

It was a most successful eve- 
ning. 

Goodman returned Janna to 
her home at a respectable hour 
and arranged a date for the fol- 
lowing evening. Made bold by 
his own tales, he kissed her on 
the cheek. She didn’t really seem 
to mind, but Goodman didn’t try 
to press his advantage. 

“Till tomorrow then,” she said, 
smiled at him, and closed the 
door. 

"tTE WALKED away feeling 
light-headed. Janna! Janna! 
Was it conceivable that he was 
in love already? Why not? Love 
at first sight was a proven psycho- 
physiological possibility and, as 
such, was perfectly respectable. 
Love in utopia! How wonderful 
it was that here, upon a perfect 
planet, he had found the perfect 
girl! 

A man stepped out of the 
shadows and blocked his path. 
Goodman noted that he was 
wearing a black silk mask which 
covered everything except his 
eyes. He was carrying a large 
and powerful-looking blaster, and 

22 



it was pointed steadily at Good- 
man’s stomach. 

“Okay, buddy,” the man said, 
“gimme all your money.” 

“What?” Goodman gasped. 

“You heard me. Your money. 
Hand it over.” 

“You can’t do this,” Goodman 
said, too startled to think coher- 
ently. “There’s no crime on 
Tranai!” 

“Who said there was?” the man 
asked quietly. “I’m merely ask- 
ing you for your money. Are you 
going to hand it over peacefully 
or do I have to club it out of 
you?” 

“You can’t get away with this! 
Crime does not pay!” 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” the man 
said. He hefted the heavy blaster. 

“All right. Don’t get excited.” 
Goodman pulled out his billfold, 
which contained all he had in the 
world, and gave its contents to 
the masked man. 

The man counted it, and he 
seemed impressed. “Better than 
I expected. Thanks, buddy. Take 
it easy now.” 

He hurried away down a dark 
street. 

Goodman looked wildly around 
for a policeman, until he remem- 
bered that there were no police 
on Tranai. He saw a small cock- 
tail lounge on the corner with a 
neon sign saying Kitty Kat Bar. 
He hurried into it. 

Inside, there was only a bar- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tender, somberly wiping glasses. 

“I’ve been robbed!” Goodman 
shouted at him. 

“So?” the bartender said, not 
even looking up. 

“But I thought there wasn’t 
any crime on Tranai.” 

“There isn’t.” 

“But I was robbed.” 

“You must be new here,” the 
bartender said, finally looking at 
him. 

“I just came in from Terra.” 

“Terra? Nervous, hustling sort 
of—” 

“Yes, yes,” Goodman said. He 
was getting a little tired of that 
stereotype. “But how can there 
be no crime on Tranai if I was 
robbed?” 

“That should be obvious. On 
Tranai, robbery is no crime.” 

“But robbery is always a 
crime!” 

“What color mask was he 
wearing?” 

Goodman thought for a mo- 
ment. “Black. Black silk.” 

The bartender nodded. “Then 
he was a government tax col- 
lector.” 

“That’s a ridiculous way to 
collect taxes,” Goodman snapped. 

T HE BARTENDER set a 
Tranai Special in front of 
Goodman. “Try to see this in 
terms of the general welfare. The 
government has to have some 
money. By collecting it this way, 



we can avoid the necessity of an 
income tax, with all its compli- 
cated legal and legislative ap- 
paratus. And in terms of mental 
health, it’s far better to extract 
money in a short, quick, painless 
operation than to permit the citi- 
zen to worry all year long about 
paying at a specific date.” 

Goodman downed his drink 
and the bartender set up another. 

“But,” Goodman said, “I 
thought this was a society based 
upon the concepts of free will 
and individual initiative.” 

“It is,” the bartender told him. 
“Then surely the government, 
what little there is of it, has the 
same right to free will as any 
private citizen, hasn’t it?” 

Goodman couldn’t quite figure 
that out, so he finished his second 
drink. “Could I have another of 
those? I’ll pay you as soon as I 
can.” 

“Sure, sure,” the bartender said 
good-naturedly, pouring another 
drink and one for himself. 

Goodman said, “You asked me 
what color his mask was. Why?” 
“Black is the government mask 
color. Private citizens wear white 
masks.” 

“You mean that private citi- 
zens commit robbery also?” 
“Well, certainly! That’s our 
method of wealth distribution. 
Money is equalized without gov- 
ernment intervention, without 
even taxation, entirely in terms

of individual initiative.” The bar- 
tender nodded emphatically. 
“And it works perfectly, too. Rob- 
bery is a great leveler, you know.” 
“I suppose it is,” Goodman ad- 
mitted, finishing his third drink. 
“If I understand correctly, then, 
any citizen can pack a blaster, 
put on a mask, and go out and 
rob.” 

“Exactly,” the bartender said. 
“Within limits, of course.” 

Goodman snorted. “If that’s 
how it works, I can play that way. 
Could you loan me a mask? And 
a gun?” 

The bartender reached under 
the bar. “Be sure to return them, 

24 



though. Family heirlooms.” 

“I’ll return them,” Goodman 
promised. “And when I come 
back, I’ll pay for my drinks.” 

He slipped the blaster into his 
belt, donned the mask and left 
the bar. If this was how things 
worked on Tranai, he could ad- 
just all right. Rob him, would 
they? He’d rob them right back 
and then some! 

OTE FOUND a suitably dark 
street corner and huddled 
in the shadows, waiting. Present- 
ly he heard footsteps and, peer- 
ing around the corner, saw a 
portly, well-dressed Tranaian 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




hurrying down the street. 

Goodman stepped in front of 
him, snarling, “Hold it, buddy.” 
The Tranaian stopped and 
looked at Goodman’s blaster. 
“Hmmm. Using a wide-aperture 
Drog 3, eh? Rather an old-fash- 
ioned weapon. How do you like 
it?” 

“It’s fine,” Goodman said. 
“Hand over your — ” 

“Slow trigger action, though,” 
the Tranian mused. “Personally, 
I recommend a Mils-Sleeven 
needier. As it happens, I’m a sales 
representative for Sleeven Arms. 
I could get you a very good price 
on a trade-in — ” 



“Hand over your money,” 
Goodman barked. 

The portly Tranaian smiled. 
“The basic defect of your Drog 
3 is the fact that it won’t fire at 
all unless you release the safety 
lock.” He reached out and slap- 
ped the gun out of Goodman’s 
hand. “You see? You couldn’t 
have done a thing about it.” He 
started to walk away. 

Goodman scooped up the 
blaster, found the safety lock, re- 
leased it and hurried after the 
Tranaian. 

“Stick up your hands,” Good- 
man ordered, beginning to feel 
slightly desperate. 

“No, no, my good man,” the 
Tranian said, not even looking 
back. “Only one try to a custo- 
mer. Mustn’t break the unwritten 
law, you know.” 

Goodman stood and watched 
until the man turned a corner 
and was gone. He checked the 
Drog 3 carefully and made sure 
that all safeties were off. Then 
he resumed his post. 

After an hour’s wait, he heard 
footsteps again. He tightened his 
grip on the blaster. This time he 
was going to rob and nothing 
was going to stop him. 

“Okay, buddy,” he said, “hands 
up!” 

The victim this time was a 
short, stocky Tranaian, dressed in 
old workman’s clothes. He gaped 
at the gun in Goodman’s hand. 



A TICKET TO TRANAI 



25 



“Don’t shoot, mister,” the 
Tranaian pleaded. 

T HAT WAS more like it! 

Goodman felt a glow of deep 
satisfaction. 

“Just don’t move,” he warned. 
“I’ve got all safeties off.” 

“I can see that,” the stocky man 
said cringing. “Be careful with 
that cannon, mister. I ain’t mov- 
ing a hair.” 

“You’d better not. Hand over 
your money.” 

“Money?” 

“Yes, your money, and be 
quick about it.” 

“I don’t have any money,” the 
man whined. “Mister, I’m a poor 
man. I’m poverty-stricken.” 

“There is no poverty on 
Tranai,” Goodman said senten- 
tiously. 

“I know. But you can get so 
close to it, you wouldn’t know 
the difference. Give me a break, 
mister.” 

“Haven’t you any initiative?” 
Goodman asked. “If you’re poor, 
why don’t you go out and rob 
like everybody else?” 

“I just haven’t had a chance. 
First the kid got the whooping 
cough and I was up every night 
with her. Then the derrsin broke 
down, so I had the wife yakking 
at me all day long. I say there 
oughta be a spare derrsin in 
every house! So she decided to 
clean the place while the derrsin 

26 



generator was being fixed and 
she put my blaster somewhere 
and she can’t remember where. 
So I was all set to borrow a 
friend’s blaster when — ” 

“That’s enough,” Goodman 
said. “This is a robbery and I’m 
going to rob you of something. 
Hand over your wallet.” 

The man snuffled miserably 
and gave Goodman a worn bill- 
fold. Inside it, Goodman found 
one deeglo, the equivalent of a 
Terran dollar. 

“It’s all I got,” the man 
snuffled miserably, “but you’re 
welcome to it. I know how it is, 
standing on a drafty street corner 
all night — ” 

“Keep it,” Goodman said, hand- 
ing the billfold back to the man 
and walking off. 

“Gee, thanks, mister!” 
Goodman didn’t answer. Dis- 
consolately, he returned to the 
Kitty Kat Bar and gave back the 
bartender’s blaster and mask. 
When he explained what had 
happened, the bartender burst in- 
to rude laughter. 

“Didn’t have any money! Man, 
that’s the oldest trick in the 
books. Everybody carries a fake 
wallet for robberies — sometimes 
two or even three. Did you search 
him?” 

“No,” Goodman confessed. 
“Brother, are you a greenhorn!” 
“I guess I am. Look, I really 
will pay you for those drinks as 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



soon as I can make some money.” 
“Sure, sure,” the bartender 
said. “You better go home and 
get some sleep. You had a busy 
night.” 

Goodman agreed. Wearily he 
returned to his hotel room and 
was asleep as soon as his head 
hit the pillow. 

H E REPORTED at the Abbag 
Home Robot Works and 
manfully grappled with the prob- 
lem of disimproving automata. 
Even in unhuman work such as 
this, Terran ingenuity began to 
tell. 

Goodman began to develop a 
new plastic for the robot’s case. 
It was a silicone, a relative of 
the “silly putty” that had ap- 
peared on Earth a long while 
back. It had the desired proper- 
ties of toughness, resiliency and 
long wear; it would stand a lot 
of abuse, too. But the case would 
shatter immediately and with 
spectacular effect upon receiving 
a kick delivered with an impact 
of thirty pounds or more. 

His employer praised him for 
this development, gave him a 
bonus (which he sorely needed), 
and told him to keep working on 
the idea and, if possible, to bring 
the needed impact down to 
twenty-three pounds. This, the 
research department told them, 
was the average frustration kick. 
He was kept so busy that he

had practically no time to explore 
further the mores and folkways 
of Tranai. He did manage to see 
the Citizen’s Booth. This unique- 
ly Tranaian institution was 
housed in a small building on a 
quiet back street. 

Upon entering, he was con- 
fronted by a large board, upon 
which was listed the names of 
the present officeholders of 
Tranai, and their titles. Beside 
each name was a button. The 
attendant told Goodman that, by 
pressing a button, a citizen ex- 
pressed his disapproval of that 
official’s acts. The pressed button 
was automatically registered in 
History Hall and was a perman- 
ent mark against the officeholder. 

No minors were allowed to 
press the buttons, of course. 

Goodman considered this some- 
what ineffectual; but perhaps, he 
told himself, officials on Tranai 
were differently motivated from 
those on Earth. 

He saw Janna almost every 
evening and together they ex- 
plored the many cultural aspects 
of Tranai: the cocktail lounges 
and movies, the concert halls, the 
art exhibitions, the science mu- 
seum, the fairs and festivals. 
Goodman carried a blaster and, 
after several unsuccessful at- 
tempts, robbed a merchant of 
nearly five hundred deeglo. 

Janna was ecstatic over the 
achievement, as any sensible 

27 



Tranaian girl would be, and they 
celebrated at the Kitty Kat Bar. 
Janna’s parents agreed that Good- 
man seemed to be a good pro- 
vider. 

The following night, the five 
hundred deeglo — plus some of 
Goodman’s bonus money — was 
robbed back, by a man of ap- 
proximately the size and build of 
the bartender at the Kitty Kat, 
carrying an ancient Drog 3 
blaster. 

Goodman consoled himself 
with the thought that the money 
was circulating freely, as the 
system had intended. 

T HEN he had another triumph. 

One day at the Abbag Home 
Robot Works, he discovered a 
completely new process for mak- 
ing a robot’s case. It was a spe- 
cial plastic, impervious even to 
serious bumps and falls. The 
robot owner had to wear special 
shoes, with a catalytic agent im- 
bedded in the heels. When he 
kicked the robot, the catalyst 
came in contact with the plastic 
case, with immediate and gratify- 
ing effect. 

Abbag was a little uncertain at 
first; it seemed too gimmicky. 
But the thing caught on like wild- 
fire and the Home Robot Works 
went into the shoe business as 
a subsidiary, selling at least one 
pair with every robot. 

This horizontal industrial de- 



velopment was very gratifying to 
the plant’s stockholders and was 
really more important than the 
original catalyst-plastic discov- 
ery. Goodman received a substan- 
tial raise in pay and a generous 
bonus. 

On the crest of his triumphant 
wave, he proposed to Janna and 
was instantly accepted. Her par- 
ents favored the match; all that 
remained was to obtain official 
sanction from the government, 
since Goodman was still technic- 
ally an alien. 

Accordingly, he took a day off 
from work and walked down to 
the Idrig Building to see Melith. 
It was a glorious spring day of 
the sort that Tranai has for ten 
months out of the year, and 
Goodman walked with a light 
and springy step. He was in love, 
a success in business, and soon 
to become a citizen of utopia. 

Of course, utopia could use 
some changes, for even Tranai 
wasn’t quite perfect. Possibly he 
should accept the Supreme Presi- 
dency, in order to make the need- 
ed reforms. But there was no 
rush. 

“Hey, mister,” a voice said, 
“can you spare a deeglo?” 

Goodman looked down and 
saw, squatting on the pavement, 
an unwashed old man, dressed 
in rags, holding out a tin cup. 

“What?” Goodman asked. 

“Can you spare a deeglo, 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



brother?” the man repeated in a 
wheedling voice. “Help a poor 
man buy a cup of oglo? Haven’t 
eaten in two days, mister.” 

“This is disgraceful! Why don’t 
you get a blaster and go out and 
rob someone?” 

“I’m too old,” the man whimp- 
ered. “My victims just laugh at 
me.” 

“Are you sure you aren’t just 
lazy?” Goodman asked sternly. 

“I’m not, sir!” the beggar said. 
“Just look how my hands shake!” 

He held out both dirty paws; 
they trembled. 

G oodman took out his bill- 
fold and gave the old man 
a deeglo. “I thought there was no 
poverty on Tranai. I understood 
that the government took care of 
the aged.” 

“The government does,” said 
the old man. “Look.” He held out 
his cup. Engraved on its side was: 
Government Authorized Beggar, 
Number DJ3-43241-3. 

“You mean the government 
makes you do this?” 

“The government lets me do 
it,” the old man told him. “Beg- 
ging is a government job and is 
reserved for the aged and infirm.” 
“Why, that’s disgraceful!” 

“You must be a stranger here.” 
“I’m a Terr an.” 

“Aha! Nervous, hustling sort of 
people, aren’t you?” 

“Our government does not let 



people beg,” Goodman said. 

“No? What do the old people 
do? Live off their children? Or 
sit in some home for the aged 
and wait for death by boredom? 
Not here, young man. On Tranai, 
every old man is assured of a 
government job, and one for 
which he needs no particular 
skill, although skill helps. Some 
apply for indoor work, within the 
churches and theatres. Others 
like the excitement of fairs and 
carnivals. Personally, I like it out- 
doors. My job keeps me out in 
the sunlight and fresh air, gives 
me mild exercise, and helps me 
meet many strange and interest- 
ing people, such as yourself.” 

“But begging!” 

“What other work would I be 
suited for?” 

“I don’t know. But — but look 
at you! Dirty, unwashed, in filthy 
clothes — ” 

“These are my working 
clothes,” the government beggar 
said. “You should see me on Sun- 
day.” 

“You have other clothes?” 

“I certainly do, and a pleasant 
little apartment, and a season box 
at the opera, and two Home 
Robots, and probably more 
money in the bank than you’ve 
seen in your life. It’s been pleas- 
ant talking to you, young man, 
and thanks for your contribution. 
But now I must return to work 
and suggest you do likewise.”

Goodman walked away, glanc- 
ing over his shoulder at the gov- 
ernment beggar. He observed 
that the old man seemed to be 
doing a thriving business. 

But begging! 

Really, that sort of thing 
should be stopped. If he ever 
assumed the Presidency — and 
quite obviously he should — he 
would look into the whole matter 
more carefully. 

It seemed to him that there 
had to be a more dignified an- 
swer. 

T THE Idrig Building, Good- 
man told Melith about his 
marriage plans. 

The immigrations minister was 
enthusiastic. 

“Wonderful, absolutely won- 
derful,” he said. “I’ve known the 
Vley family for a long time. 
They’re splendid people. And 
Janna is a girl any man would 
be proud of.” 

“Aren’t there some formalities 
I should go through?” Goodman 
asked. “I mean being an alien 
and all — ” 

“None whatsoever. I’ve decid- 
ed to dispense with the formali- 
ties. You can become a citizen 
of Tranai, if you wish, by merely 
stating your intention verbally. 
Or you can retain Terran citizen- 
ship, with no hard feelings. Or 
you can do both — be a citizen 
of Terra and Tranai. If Terra 

30 



doesn’t mind, we certainly don’t.” 

“I think I’d like to become a 
citizen of Tranai,” Goodman said. 

“It’s entirely up to you. But if 
you’re thinking about the Presi- 
dency, you can retain Terran 
status and still hold office. We 
aren’t at all stuffy about that sort 
of thing. One of our most suc- 
cessful Supreme Presidents was 
a lizard-evolved chap from Aqua- 
rella XI.” 

“What an enlightened atti- 
tude!” 

“Sure, give everybody a 
chance, that’s our motto. Now as 
to your marriage — any govern- 
ment employee can perform the 
ceremonies. Supreme President 
Borg would be happy to do it, 
this afternoon if you like.” Melith 
winked. “The old codger likes to 
kiss the bride. But I think he’s 
genuinely fond of you.” , 

“This afternoon?” Goodman 
said. “Yes, I would like to be 
married this afternoon, if it’s all 
right with Janna.” 

“It probably will be,” Melith 
assured him. “Next, where are you 
going to live after the honey- 
moon? A hotel room is hardly 
suitable.” He thought for a mo- 
ment. “Tell you what — I’ve got 
a little house on the edge of town. 
Why don’t you move in there, 
until you find something better? 
Or stay permanently, if you like 
it.” 

“Really,” Goodman protested, 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“you’re too generous - — ” 

“Think nothing of it. Have you 
ever thought of becoming the 
next immigrations minister? You 
might like the work. No red tape, 
short hours, good pay — No? 
Got your eye on the Supreme 
Presidency, eh? Can’t blame you, 
I suppose.” 

Melith dug in his pockets and 
found two keys. “This is for the 
front door and this is for the 
back. The address is stamped 
right on them. The place is fully 
equipped, including a brand-new 
derrsin field generator.” 

“A derrsin?” 

“Certainly. No home on Tranai 
is complete without a derrsin 
stasis field generator.” 

C LEARING his throat, Good- 
man said carefully, “I’ve 
been meaning to ask you — 
exactly what is the stasis field 
used for?” 

“Why, to keep one’s wife in,” 
Melith answered. “I thought you 
knew.” 

“I did,” said Goodman. “But 
why?” 

“Why?” Melith frowned. Ap- 
parently the question had never 
entered his head. “Why does one 
do anything? It’s the custom, 
that’s all. And very logical, too. 
You wouldn’t want a woman 
chattering around you all the 
time, night and day.” 

Goodman blushed, because 



ever since he had met Janna, he 
had been thinking how pleasant 
it would be to have her around 
him all the time, night and day. 

“It hardly seems fair to the 
women,” Goodman pointed out. 

Melith laughed. “My dear 
friend, are you preaching the doc- 
trine of equality of the sexes? 
Really, it’s a completely dis- 
proved theory. Men and women 
just aren’t the same. They’re dif- 
ferent, no matter what you’ve 
been told on Terra. What’s good 
for men isn’t necessarily — or 
even usually — good for women.” 
“Therefore you treat them as 
inferiors,” Goodman said, his re- 
former’s blood beginning to boil. 

“Not at all. We treat them in 
a different manner from men, but 
not in an inferior manner. Any- 
how, they don’t object.” 

“That’s because they haven’t 
been allowed to know any better. 
Is there any law that requires 
me to keep my wife in the derr- 
sin field?” 

“Of course not. The custom 
simply suggests that you keep 
her out of stasis for a certain 
minimum amount of time every 
week. No fair incarcerating the 
little woman, you know.” 

“Of course not,” Goodman said 
sarcastically. “Must let her live 
some of the time.” 

“Exactly,” Melith said, seeing 
no sarcasm in what Goodman 
said. “You’ll catch on.”

Goodman stood up. “Is that 
all?” 

“I guess that’s about it. Good 
luck and all that.” 

“Thank you,” Goodman said 
stiffly, turned sharply and left. 

T HAT afternoon, Supreme 
President Borg performed 
the simple Tranaian marriage 
rites at the National Mansion 
and afterward kissed the bride 
with zeal. It was a beautiful cere- 
mony and was marred by only 
one thing. 

Hanging on Borg’s wall was a 
rifle, complete with telescopic 
sight and silencer. It was a twin 
to Melith’s and just as inexplica- 
ble. 

Borg took Goodman to one 
side and asked, “Have you given 
any further thought to the Su- 
preme Presidency?” 

“I’m still considering it,” Good- 
man said. “I don’t really want to 
hold public office — ” 

“No one does.” 

“ — but there are certain re- 
forms that Tranai needs badly. I 
think it may be my duty to bring 
them to the attention of the peo- 
ple.” 

“That’s the spirit,” Borg said 
approvingly. “We haven’t had a 
really enterprising Supreme 
President for some time. Why 
don’t you take office right now? 
Then you could have your 
honeymoon in the National Man- 

32 



sion with complete privacy.” 

Goodman was tempted. But he 
didn’t want to be bothered by 
affairs of state on his honeymoon, 
which was all arranged anyhow. 
Since Tranai had lasted so long 
in its present near-utopian condi- 
tion, it would undoubtedly keep 
for a few weeks more. 

“I’ll consider it when I come 
back,” Goodman said. 

Borg shrugged. “Well, I guess 
I can bear the burden a while 
longer. Oh, here.” He handed 
Goodman a sealed envelope. 

“What’s this?” 

“Just the standard advice,” 
Borg said. “Hurry, your bride’s 
waiting for you!” 

“Come on, Marvin!” Janna 
called. “We don’t want to be late 
for the spaceship.” 

Goodman hurried after her, in- 
to the spaceport limousine. 

“Good luck!” her parents cried. 

“Good luck!” Borg shouted. 

“Good luck!” added Melith 
and his wife, and all the guests. 

On the way to the spaceport, 
Goodman opened the envelope 
and read the printed sheet with- 
in: 

ADVICE TO A NEW HUSBAND 

You have just been married 
and you expect, quite naturally, 
a lifetime of connubial bliss. This 
is perfectly proper, for a happy 
marriage is the foundation of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



good government. But you must 
do more than merely wish tor it. 
Good marriage is not yours by 
divine right. A good marriage 
must be worked tor! 

Remember that your wife is a 
human being. She should be al- 
lowed a certain measure of free- 
dom as her inalienable right. We 
suggest you take her out of stasis 
at least once a week. Too long in 
stasis is bad for her orientation. 
Too much stasis is bad for her 
complexion and this will be your 
loss as well as hers. 

At intervals, such as vacations 
and holidays, it’s customary to 
let your wife remain out of stasis 
for an entire day at a time, or 
even two or three days. It will 
do no harm and the novelty will 
do wonders for her state of mind. 

Keep in mind these few com- 
mon-sense rules and you can be 
assured of a happy marriage. 

— By the Government 
Marriage Council 

G OODMAN slowly tore the 
card into little bits, and let 
them drop to the floor of the 
limousine. His reforming spirit 
was now thoroughly aroused. He 
had known that Tranai was too 
good to be true. Someone had to 
pay for perfection. In this case, 
it was the women. 

He had found the first serious 
flaw in paradise. 

“What was that, dear?” Janna 



asked, looking at the bits of 
paper. 

“That was some very foolish 
advice.” Goodman said. “Dear, 
have you ever thought — really 
thought — about the marriage 
customs of this planet of yours?” 
“I don’t think I have. Aren’t 
they all right?” 

“They are wrong, completely 
wrong. They treat women like 
toys, like little dolls that one 
puts away when one is finished 
playing. Can’t you see that?” 

“I never thought about it.” 
“Well, you can think about it 
now,” Goodman told her, “be- 
cause some changes are going to 
be made and they’re going to 
start in our home.” 

“Whatever you think best, 
darling,” Janna said dutifully. 
She squeezed his arm. He kissed 
her. 

And then the limousine 
reached the spaceport and they 
got aboard the ship. 

Their honeymoon on Doe was 
like a brief sojourn in a flawless 
paradise. The wonders of Tranai’s 
little moon had been built for 
lovers, and for lovers only. No 
businessman came to Doe for a 
quick rest; no predatory bachelor 
prowled the paths. The tired, the 
disillusioned, the lewdly hopeful 
all had to find other hunting 
grounds. The single rule on Doe, 
strictly enforced, was two by 
two, joyous and in love, and in 



A TICKET TO TRANAI 



33 



no other state admitted. 

This was one Tranaian custom 
that Goodman had no trouble 
appreciating. 

On the little moon, there were 
meadows of tall grass and deep, 
green forests for walking and 
cool black lakes in the forests 
and jagged, spectacular moun- 
tains that begged to be climbed. 
Lovers were continually getting 
lost in the forests, to their great 
satisfaction; but not too lost, for 
one could circle the whole moon 
in a day. Thanks, to the gentle 
gravity, no . one could drown in 
the black lakes, and a fall from 
a mountaintop was frightening, 
but hardly dangerous. 

There were, at strategic loca- 
tions, little hotels with dimly lit 
cocktail lounges run by friendly, 
white-haired bartenders. There 
were gloomy caves which ran 
deep (but never too deep) into 
phosphorescent caverns glittering 
with ice, past sluggish under- 
ground rivers in which swam 
great luminous fish with fiery 
eyes. 

The Government Marriage 
Council had considered these 
simple attractions sufficient and 
hadn’t bothered putting in a golf 
course, swimming pool, horse 
track or shuffleboard court. It 
was felt that once a couple de- 
sired these things, the honey- 
moon was over. 

Goodman and his bride spent 



an enchanted week on Doe and 
at last returned to Tranai. 

A FTER carrying his bride 
across the threshold of their 
new home, Goodman’s first act 
was to unplug the derrsin genera- 
tor. 

“My dear,” he said, “up to now, 
I have followed all the customs 
of Tranai, even when they 
seemed ridiculous to me. But this 
is one thing I will not sanction. 
On Terra, I was the founder of 
the Committee for Equal Job 
Opportunities for Women. On 
Terra, we treat our women as 
equals, as companions, as part- 
ners in the adventure of life.” 
“What a strange concept,” 
Janna said, a frown clouding her 
pretty face. 

“Think about it,” Goodman 
urged. “Our life will be far more 
satisfying in this companionable 
manner than if I shut you up in 
the purdah of the derrsin field. 
Don’t you agree?” 

“You know far more than I, 
dear. You’ve traveled all over 
the Galaxy, and I’ve never been 
out of Port Tranai. If you say 
it’s the best way, then it must be.” 
Past a doubt, Goodman 
thought, she was the most per- 
fect of women. 

He returned to his work at the 
Abbag Home Robot Works and 
was soon deep in another disim- 
provement project. This time, he

conceived the bright idea of mak- 
ing the robot’s joints squeak and 
grind. The noise would increase 
the robot’s irritation value, there- 
by making its destruction more 
pleasing and psychologically 
more valuable. Mr. Abbag was 
overjoyed with the idea, gave 
him another pay raise, and asked 
him to have the disimprovement 
ready for early production. 

Goodman’s first plan was sim- 
ply to remove some of the lubri- 
cation ducts. But he found that 
friction would then wear out vital 
parts too soon. That naturally 
could not be sanctioned. 

He began to draw up plans 
for a built-in squeak-and-grind 
unit. It had to be absolutely life- 
like and yet cause no real wear. 
It had to be inexpensive and it 
had to be small, because the 
robot’s interior was already 
packed with disimprovements. 

But Goodman found that small 
squeak-producing units sounded 
artificial. Larger units were too 
costly to manufacture or couldn’t 
be fitted inside the robot’s case. 
He began working several eve- 
nings a week, lost weight, and 
his temper grew edgy. 

J ANNA became a good, de- 
pendable wife. His meals were 
always ready on time and she 
invariably had a cheerful word 
for him in the evenings and a 
sympathetic ear for his difficul- 



ties. During the day, she super- 
vised the cleaning of the house 
by the Home Robots. This took 
less than an hour and afterward 
she read books, baked pies, knit- 
ted, and destroyed robots. 

Goodman was a little alarmed 
at this, because Janna destroyed 
them at the rate of three or four 
a week. Still, everyone had to 
have a hobby. He could afford to 
indulge her, since he got the ma- 
chines at cost. 

Goodman had reached a com- 
plete impasse when another de- 
signer, a man named Dath Hergo, 
came up with a novel control. 
This was based upon a counter- 
gyroscopic principle and allowed 
a robot to enter a room at a ten- 
degree list. (Ten degrees, the 
research department said, was 
the most irritating angle of list 
a robot could assume.) More- 
over, by employing a random 
selection principle, the robot 
would lurch, drunkenly, annoy- 
ingly, at irregular intervals — 
never dropping anything, but al- 
ways on the verge of it. 

This development was, quite 
naturally, hailed as a great ad- 
vance in disimprovement engi- 
neering. And Goodman found 
that he could center his built-in 
squeak-and-grind unit right in 
the lurch control. His name was 
mentioned in the engineering 
journals next to that of Dath 
Hergo.

The new line of Abbag Home 
Robots was a sensation. 

At this time, Goodman decid- 
ed to take a leave of absence 
from his job and assume the 
Supreme Presidency of Tranai. 
He felt he owed it to the people. 
If Terran ingenuity and know- 
how could bring out improve- 
ments in disimprovements, they 
would do even better improving 
improvements. Tranai was a near- 
utopia. With his hand on the 
reins, they could go the rest of 
the way to perfection. 

He went down to Melith’s of- 
fice to talk it over. 

“I suppose there’s always room 
for change,” Melith said thought- 
fully. The immigration chief was 
seated by the window, idly watch- 
ing people pass by. “Of course, 
our present system has been 
working for quite some time and 
working very well. I don’t know 
what you’d improve. There’s no 
crime, for example — ” 

“Because you’ve legalized it,” 
Goodman declared. “You’ve sim- 
ply evaded the issue.” 

“We don’t see it that way. 
There’s no poverty — ” 

“Because everybody steals. 
And there’s no trouble with old 
people because the government 
turns them into beggars. Really, 
there’s plenty of room for change 
and improvement.” 

“Well, perhaps,” Melith said. 
“But I think — ” he stopped sud- 



denly, rushed over to the wall 
and pulled down the rifle. “There 
he is!” 

G oodman looked out the 

window. A man, apparently 
no different from anyone else, 
was walking past. He heard a 
muffled click and saw the man 
stagger, then drop to the pave- 
ment. 

Melith had shot him with the 
silenced rifle. 

“What did you do that for?” 
Goodman gasped. 

“Potential murderer,” Melith 
said. 

“What?” 

“Of course. We don’t have any 
out-and-out crime here, but, be- 
ing human, we have to deal with 
the potentiality.” 

“What did he do to make him 
a potential murderer?” 

“Killed five people,” Melith 
stated. 

“But — damn it, man, this 
isn’t fair! You didn’t arrest him, 
give him a trial, the benefit of 
counsel — ” 

“How could I?” Melith asked, 
slightly annoyed. “We don’t have 
any police to arrest people with 
and we don’t have any legal sys- 
tem. Good Lord, you didn’t ex- 
pect me to just let him go on, 
did you? Our definition of a 
murderer is a killer of ten and 
he was well on his way. I couldn’t 
just sit idly by. It’s my duty to 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



protect the people. I can assure 
you, I made careful inquiries.” 
“It isn’t just!” Goodman shout- 
ed. 

“Who ever said it was?” 
Melith shouted back. “What has 
justice got to do with utopia?” 
“Everything!” Goodman had 
calmed himself with an effort. 
“Justice is the basis of human 
dignity, human desire — ” 

“Now you’re just using words,” 
Melith said, with his usual good- 
natured smile. “Try to be realis- 
tic. We have created a utopia 
for human beings, not for saints 
who don’t need one. We must 
accept the deficiencies of the hu- 
man character, not pretend they 
don’t exist. To our way of think- 
ing, a police apparatus and a 
legal-judicial system all tend to 
create an atmosphere for crime 
and an acceptance of crime. It’s 
better, believe me, not to accept 
the possibility of crime at all. 
The vast majority of the people 
will go along with you.” 

“But when crime does turn 
up, as it inevitably does — ” 
“Only the potentiality turns 
up,” Melith insisted stubbornly. 
“And even that is much rarer than 
you would think. When it shows 
up, we deal with it, quickly and 
simply.” 

“Suppose you get the wrong 
man?” 

“We can’t get the wrong man. 
Not a chance of it.” 

A TICKET TO TRAN A i 



“Why not?” 

“Because,” Melith said, “any- 
one disposed of by a government 
official is, by definition and by 
unwritten law, a potential crimi- 
nal.” 

"V/|" ARVIN Goodman was silent 
-‘-"-l for a while. Then he said, 
“I see that the government has 
more power than I thought at 
first.” 

“It does,” Melith said. “But 
not as much as you now imagine.” 
Goodman smiled ironically. 
“And is the Supreme Presidency 
still mine for the asking?” 

“Of course. And with no strings 
attached. Do you want it?” 

Goodman thought deeply for a 
moment. Did he really want it? 
Well, someone had to rule. Some- 
one had to protect the people. 
Someone had to make a few re- 
forms in this utopian madhouse. 

“Yes, I want it,” Goodman 
said. 

The door burst open and Su- 
preme President Borg rushed in. 
“Wonderful! Perfectly wonderful! 
You can move into the National 
Mansion today. I’ve been packed 
for a week, waiting for you to 
make up your mind.” 

“There must be certain for- 
malities to go through — ” 

“No formalities,” Borg said, his 
face shining with perspiration. 
“None whatsoever. All we do is 
hand over the Presidential Seal; 

37 




then I’ll go down and take my 
name off the rolls and put yours 
on.” 

Goodman looked at Melith. 
The immigration minister’s round 
face was expressionless. 

“All right,” Goodman said. 



threw it over Borg’s head. Good- 
man backed to a chair and fell 
into it. His mouth opened, but 
no words came out. 

“It’s really a pity,” Melith 
said. “He was so near the end of 
his term. I warned him against 



Borg reached for the Presiden- 
tial Seal, started to remove it 
from his neck — 

It exploded suddenly and vio- 
lently. 

Goodman found himself star- 
ing in horror at Borg’s red, 
ruined head. The Supreme Presi- 
dent tottered for a moment, then 
slid to the floor. 

Melith took off his jacket and 



licensing that new spaceport. The 
citizens won’t approve, I told 
him. But he was sure they would 
like to have two spaceports. Well, 
he was wrong.” 

“Do you mean — I mean — 
how — what — ” 

“All government officials,” Me- 
lith explained, “wear the badge 
of office, which contains a tradi- 
tional amount of tessium, an ex- 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




plosive you may have heard of. 
The charge is radio-controlled 
from the Citizens Booth. Any 
citizen has access to the Booth, 
for the purpose of expressing his 
disapproval of the government.” 
Melith sighed. “This will go 




down as a permanent black mark 
against poor Borg’s record.” 

LET the people ex- 
press their disapproval by 
blowing up officials?” Goodman 
croaked, appalled. 

“It’s the only way that means 
anything,” said Melith. “Check 
and balance. Just as the people 
are in our hands, so we are in 



the people’s hands.” 

“And that’s why he wanted 
me to take over his term. Why 
didn’t anyone tell me?” 

“You didn’t ask,” Melith said, 
with the suspicion of a smile. 
“Don’t look so horrified. Assassi- 
nation is always possible, you 
know, on any planet, under any 
government. We try to make it 
a constructive thing. Under this 
system, the people never lose 
touch with the government, and 
the government never tries to 
assume dictatorial powers. And, 
since everyone knows he can 
turn to the Citizens Booth, you’d 
be surprised how sparingly it’s 
used. Of course, there are always 
hotheads — ” 

Goodman got to his feet and 
started to the door, not looking 
at Borg’s body. 

“Don’t you still want the Presi- 
dency?” asked Melith. 

“No!” 

“That’s so like you Terrans,” 
Melith remarked sadly. “You 
want responsibility only if it 
doesn’t incur risk. That’s the 
wrong attitude for running a 
government.” 

“You may be right,” Goodman 
said. “I’m just glad I found out 
in time.” 

He hurried home. 

His mind was in a complete 
turmoil when he entered his 
house. Was Tranai a utopia or a 
planetwide insane asylum? Was

39 



there much difference? For the 
first time in his life, Goodman 
was wondering if utopia was 
worth having. Wasn’t it better to 
strive for perfection than to pos- 
sess it? To have ideals rather 
than to live by them? If justice 
was a fallacy, wasn’t the fallacy 
better than the truth? 

Or was it? Goodman was a 
sadly confused young man when 
he shuffled into his house and 
found his wife in the arms of 
another man. 

T HE SCENE had a terrible 
slow-motion clarity in his 
eyes. It seemed to take Janna 
forever to rise to her feet, 

straighten her disarranged cloth- 
ing and stare at him open- 
mouthed. The man — a tall, 
good-looking fellow whom Good- 
man had never before seen — 
appeared too startled to speak. 
He made small, aimless gestures, 
brushing the lapel of his jacket, 
pulling down his cuffs. 

Then, tentatively, the man 

smiled. 

“Well!” Goodman said. It was 
feeble enough, under the circum- 
stances, but it had its effect. 

Janna started to cry. 

“Terribly sorry,” the man mur- 
mured. “Didn’t expect you home 
for hours. This must come as a 
shock to you. I’m terribly sorry.” 
The one thing Goodman hadn’t 
expected or wanted was sym- 

40 



pathy from his wife’s lover. He 
ignored the man and stared at 
the weeping Janna. 

“Well, what did you expect?” 
Janna screamed at him suddenly. 
“I had to! You didn’t love me!” 

“Didn’t love you! How can 
you say that?” 

“Because of the way you treat- 
ed me.” 

“I loved you very much, 
Janna,” he said softly. 

“You didn’t!” she shril'ed, 
throwing back her head. “Just 
look at the way you treated me. 
You kept me around all day, 
every day, doing housework, 
cooking, sitting. Marvin, I could 
feel myself aging. Day after day, 
the same weary, stupid routine. 
And most of the time, when you 
came home, you were too tired 
to even notice me. All you could 
talk about was your stupid 
robots! I was being wasted, Mar- 
vin, wasted!" 

It suddenly occurred to Good- 
man that his wife was unhinged. 
Very gently he said, “But, Janna, 
that’s how life is. A husband and 
wife settle into a companionable 
situation. They age together side 
by side. It can’t all be high 
spots — ” 

“But of course it can! Try to 
understand, Marvin. It can, on 
Tranai — for a woman!” 

“It’s impossible,” Goodman 
said. 

“On Tranai, a woman expects 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a life of enjoyment and pleasure. 
It’s her right, just as men have 
their rights. She expects to come 
out of stasis and find a little 
party prepared, or a walk in the 
moonlight, or a swim, or a movie.” 
She began to cry again. “But you 
were so smart. You had to change 
it. I should have known better 
than to trust a Terran.” 

The other man sighed and 
lighted a cigarette. 

“I know you can’t help being 
an alien, Marvin,” Janna said. 
“But I do want you to under- 
stand. Love isn’t everything. A 
woman must be practical, too. 
The way things were going, I 
would have been an old woman 
while all my friends were still 
young.” 

?<?CTILL YOUNG?” Goodman 
^ repeated blankly. 

“Of course,” the man said. “A 
woman doesn’t age in the derrsin 
field.” 

“But the whole thing is ghast- 
ly,” said Goodman. “My wife 
would still be a young woman 
when I was old.” 

“That’s just when you’d appre- 
ciate a young woman,” Janna 
said. 

“But how about you?” Good- 
man asked. “Would you appre- 
ciate an old man?” 

“He still doesn’t understand,” 
the man said. 

“Marvin, try. Isn’t it clear yet? 



Throughout your life, you would 
have a young and beautiful 
woman whose only desire would 
be to please you. And when you 
died — don’t look shocked, dear; 
everybody dies — when you 
died, I would still be young, and 
by law I’d inherit all your 
money.” 

“I’m beginning to see,” Good- 
man said. “I suppose that’s an- 
other accepted phase of Tranaian 
life — the wealthy young widow 
who can pursue her own pleas- 
ures.” 

“Naturally. In this way, every- 
thing is for the best for every- 
body. The man has a young wife 
whom he sees only when he 
wishes. He has his complete free- 
dom and a nice home as well. 
The woman is relieved of all the 
dullness of ordinary living and, 
while she can still enjoy it, is 
well provided for.” 

“You should have told me,” 
Goodman complained. 

“I thought you knew,” Janna 
said, “since you thought you had 
a better way. But I can see that 
you would never have under- 
stood, because you’re so naive — 
though I must admit it’s one of 
your charms.” She smiled wist- 
fully. “Besides, if I told you, I 
would never have met Rondo.” 

The man bowed slightly. “I 
was leaving samples of Greah’s 
Confections. You can imagine my 
surprise when I found this lovely

young woman out of stasis. I 
mean it was like a storybook tale 
come true. One never expects 
old legends to happen, so you 
must admit that there’s a certain 
appeal when they do.” 

“Do you love him?” Goodman 
asked heavily. 

“Yes,” said Janna. “Rondo 
cares for me. He’s going to keep 
me in stasis long enough to make 
up for the time I’ve lost. It’s a 
sacrifice on his part, but Rondo 
has a generous nature.” 

“If that’s how it is,” Goodman 
said glumly, “I certainly won’t 
stand in your way. I am a civil- 
ized being, after all. You may 
have a divorce.” 

TT E FOLDED his arms across 
his chest, feeling quite noble. 
But he was dimly aware that his 
decision stemmed not so much 
from nobility as from a sudden, 
violent distaste for all things 
Tranaian. 

“We have no divorce on 
Tranai,” Rondo said. 

“No?” Goodman felt a cold 
chill run down his spine. 

A blaster appeared in Rondo’s 
hand. “It would be too unsettling, 
you know, if people were always 
swapping around. There’s only 
one way to change a marital 
status.” 

“But this is revolting!” Good- 
man blurted, backing away. “It’s 
against all decency!” 

42 



“Not if the wife desires it. And 
that, by the by, is another excel- 
lent reason for keeping one’s 
spouse in stasis. Have I your 
permission, my dear?” 

“Forgive me, Marvin,” Janna 
said. She closed her eyes. “Yes!” 

Rondo leveled the blaster. 
Without a moment’s hesitation, 
Goodman dived head-first out the 
nearest window. Rondo’s shot 
fanned right over him. 

“See here!” Rondo called. 
“Show some spirit, man. Stand 
up to it!” 

Goodman had landed heavily 
on his shoulder. He was up at 
once, sprinting, and Rondo’s 
second shot scorched his arm. 
Then he ducked behind a house 
and was momentarily safe. He 
didn’t stop to think about it. 
Running for all he was worth, he 
headed for the spaceport. 

Fortunately, a ship was pre- 
paring for blastoff and took him 
to g’Moree. From there he wired 
to Tranai for his funds and 
bought passage to Higastomeri- 
treia, where the authorities ac- 
cused him of being a Ding spy. 
The charge couldn’t stick, since 
the Dingans were an amphibious 
race, and Goodman almost 
drowned proving to everyone’s 
satisfaction that he could breathe 
only air. 

A drone transport took him to 
the double planet Mvanti, past 
Seves, Olgo and Mi. He hired a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bush pilot to take him to Bellis- 
moranti, where the influence of 
Terra began. From there, a local 
spaceline transported him past 
the Galactic Whirl and, after 
stopping at Oyster, Lekung, 
Pankang, Inchang and Machang, 
arrived at Tung-Bradar IV. 

His money was now gone, but 
he was practically next door to 
Terra, as astronomical distances 
go. He was able to work his pas- 
sage to Oume, and from Oume 
to Legis II. There the Interstellar 
Travelers Aid Society arranged 
a berth for him and at last he 
arrived back on Earth. 

G OODMAN has settled down 
in Seakirk, New Jersey, 
where a man is perfectly safe as 
long as he pays his taxes. He 
holds the post of Chief Robotic 
Technician for the Seakirk Con- 
struction Corporation and has 



married a small, dark, quiet girl, 
who obviously adores him, al- 
though he rarely lets her out of 
the house. 

He and old Captain Savage go 
frequently to Eddie’s Moonlight 
Bar, drink Tranai Specials, and 
talk of Tranai the Blessed, where 
The Way has been found and 
Man is no longer bound to The 
Wheel. On such occasions, Good- 
man complains of a touch of 
space malaria — because of it, 
he can never go back into space, 
can never return to Tranai. 

There is always an admiring 
audience on these nights. 

Goodman has recently organ- 
ized, with Captain Savage’s help, 
the Seakirk League to Take the 
Vote from Wonien. They are its 
only members, but as Goodman 
puts it, when did that ever stop 
a crusader?

The Discovery 
of Morniel Mathaway 

By WILLIAM TENN 

Let posterity be the judge, 
eh? And come up with a mess 
of an odd tangle like this? 



E veryone is astonished 

at the change in Morniel 
Mathaway since he was 
discovered, everyone but me. 
They remember him as an un- 
bathed and untalented Green- 
wich Village painter who began 
almost every second sentence 
with “I” and ended every third 

Illustrated 



one with “me.” He had all the 
pushing, half-frightened conceit 
of the man who secretly suspects 
himself to be a second-rater or 
worse, and any half-hour conver- 
sation with him made your ears 
droop with the boastful yells he 
threw at them. 

I understand the change in

him, the soft-spoken self-depre- 
ciation as well as the sudden 
overwhelming success. But then, 
I was there the day he was “dis- 
covered” — except that isn’t the 
right way to put it. To tell you 
the truth, I don’t know how to 
put it, really, considering the ab- 
solute impossibility — yes, I said 
impossibility, not improbability 

— of the whole business. All I 
know for sure is that trying to 
make sense out of it gives me 
belly-yammers and the biggest 
headache this side of calculus. 

We were talking about his dis- 
covery that day. I was sitting, 
carefully balanced, on the one 
wooden chair in his cold little 
Bleecker Street studio, because I 
was too sophisticated to sit in 
the easy chair. 

Morniel practically paid the 
rent on his studio with that easy 
chair. It was a broken-down 
tangle of filthy upholstery that 
was high in the front of the seat 
and very low in the back. When 
you sat in it, things began sliding 
out of your pockets — loose 
change, keys, wallets, anything 

— and into the jungle of rusty 
springs and rotting woodwork 
below. 

Whenever newcomers came to 
the place, Morniel would make 
a big fuss about showing them to 
“the comfortable chair.” And as 
they twisted about painfully try- 
ing to find a spot between the 



springs, his eyes would gleam 
and he’d get all lit up with good 
cheer. Because the more they 
moved about, the more would fall 
out of their pockets. 

After a party, he’d take the 
chair apart and start counting 
the receipts, like a store owner 
hitting the cash register the eve- 
ning after a fire sale. 

The only trouble was, to sit 
in the wooden chair, you had to 
concentrate, since it teetered. 

Morniel couldn’t lose — he 
always sat on the bed. 

46T CAN’T WAIT for the day,” 
he was saying, “when some 
dealer, some critic, with an ounce 
of brain in his head sees my 
work. I can’t miss, Dave, I know 
I can’t miss; I’m just too good. 
Sometimes I get frightened at 
how good I am — it’s almost too 
much talent for one man.” 

“Well,” I said, “there’s always 
the — ” 

“Not that it’s too much talent 
for me,” he went on, fearful that 
I might have misunderstood him. 
“I’m big enough to carry it, for- 
tunately; I’m large enough of 
soul. But another, lesser guy 
would be destroyed by this much 
totality of perception, this com- 
prehension of the spiritual ges- 
talt, as I like to put it. His mind 
would just crack wide open under 
the load. Not me, though, Dave, 
not me.”

“Do you know what I was

fast — you know, the old the-hand- 
is-quicker-than-the-eye Morniel 
— and I started to think about 
the state of modern painting. I 
think about that a lot, Dave. It 
troubles me.” 

“You do?” I said. “Well, I tend 
to — ” 

“I walked down Bleecker 
Street, then I swung into Wash- 
ington Square Park, and while I 
walked, I was thinking: Who is 
doing really important work in 
painting today who is really and 
unquestionably great? I could 
think of only three names: 
Picasso, Roualt — and me. 
There’s nobody else doing any- 
thing worthwhile and original 
nowadays. Just three names out 
of the whole host of people paint- 
ing all over the world at this 
moment: just three names, no 
more. It made me feel very lone- 
ly, Dave.” 

“I can see that,” I said. “But 
then, you — ” 

“And then I asked myself, why 
is this so? Has absolute genius 
always been so rare, is there an 



essential statistical limitation on 
it in every period, or is there 
another reason, peculiar to our 
own time? And why has my im- 
pending discovery been delayed 
so long? I thought about it for a 
long time, Dave. I thought about 
it humbly, carefully, because it’s 
an important question. And this 
is the answer I came up with.” 

I gave up. I just sat back in 
my chair — not too far back, of 
course — and listened to him 
expound a theory of esthetics I’d 
heard at least a dozen times be- 
fore, from a dozen other painters 
in the Village. The only point of 
difference between them was on 
the question of exactly who was 
the culmination and the most 
perfect living example of this 
esthetic. Morniel, you will prob- 
ably not be amazed to learn, felt 
it was himself.

from Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-

for hours, in the accents that 
sound like movie Brooklynese, 
but are actually pure Pittsburgh,

plicity.

League and grown his first strag- 
gly blond beard. Recently, he 
had developed his own technique 
which he called smudge-on- 
smudge. 

He was bad, and there were 
no two ways about it. I say that 
not only from my opinion — and 
I’ve roomed with two modern 
painters and been married for a 
year to another — but from the 
opinions of pretty knowing peo- 
ple who, having no personal axe 
to grind, looked his work over 
carefully. 

One of them, a fine critic of 
modern art, said after staring 
slack-jawed at a painting which 
Morniel had insisted on giving 
me and which, in spite of my pro- 
tests, he had personally hung 
over my fireplace: “It’s not just 
that he doesn’t say anything of 
any significance, graphically, but 
he doesn’t even set himself what 
you might call painterly prob- 
lems. White-on-white, smudge-on- 
smudge, non-objectivism, neo-ab- 
stractionism, call it what you like, 
there’s nothing there, nothing! 
He’s just another of these loud- 
mouth, frowzy, frustrated dilet- 
tantes that infest the Village.” 

So why did I spend time with 
Morniel? Well, he lived right 
around the corner. He was slight- 
ly colorful, in his own sick way. 
And when I’d sat up all night, 
trying to work on a poem that 
simply wouldn’t be worked, I of- 



ten felt it would be relaxing to 
drift around to his studio for a 
spot of conversation that wouldn’t 
have anything to do with litera- 
ture. 

The only trouble — and the 
thing I always forgot — was that 
it almost never was a conversa- 
tion. It was a monologue that I 
barely managed to break in on 
from time to time. 

You see, the difference be- 
tween us was that I’d been pub- 
lished, even if it was only in 
badly printed experimental maga- 
zines that paid off in subscrip- 
tions. He’d never been exhibited 
— not once. 

T HERE WAS another reason 
for my maintaining a friend- 
ly relationship with the man. And 
that had to do with the one 
talent he really had. 

I barely get by, so far as living 
expenses are concerned. Things 
like good paper to write on, fine 
books for my library, are stuff I 
yearn for all the time, but are 
way out of my reach financially. 
When the yearning gets too great 
— for a newly published collec- 
tion by Wallace Stevens, for ex- 
ample — I meander over to 
Morniel’s and tell him about it. 

Then we go out to the book- 
store — entering it separately. I 
start a conversation with the pro- 
prietor about some very expen- 
sive, out-of-print item that I’m 



THE DISCOVERY OF MORNIEL MATHAWAY

thinking of ordering and, once 
I’ve got all of his attention, 
Morniel snaffles the Stevens — 
which I intend to pay for, of 
course, as soon as I’m a little 
ahead. 

He’s absolutely wonderful at 
it. I’ve never seen him so much 
as suspected, let alone caught. 
Of course, I have to pay for the 



it’s not worth is the thumping 
boredom I have to suffer through 
in listening to the guy, or my 
conscience bothering me because 
I know he never intends to pay 
for those things. Okay, so I will, 
when I can. 

“I can’t be as unique as I feel 
I am,” he was saying now. “Other 
people must be born with the 




favor by going through the same 
routine in an art-supply store, so 
that Morniel can replenish his 
stock of canvas, paint and 
brushes, but it’s worth it to me 
in the long run. The only thing 



potential of such great talent, but 
it’s destroyed in them before they 
can reach artistic maturity. Why? 
How? Well, let’s examine the 
role that society — ” 

And that’s exactly when I first 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



saw it. Just as he got to the word 
“society,” I saw this purplish rip- 
ple in the wall opposite me, the 
strange, shimmering outline of a 
box with a strange, shimmering 
outline of a man inside the box. 
It was about five feet off the 
floor and it looked like colored 
heat waves. Then there was noth- 
ing on the wall. 

But it was too late in the year 
for heat waves. And I’ve never 
had optical illusions. It could be, 
I decided, that I had seen the 
beginnings of a new crack in 
Morniel’s wall. The place wasn’t 
really a studio, just a drafty cold- 
water flat that some old occupant 
had cleared so as to make one 
long room. It was on the top 
floor and the roof leaked occa- 
sionally; the walls were covered 
with thick, wavy lines in memory 
of the paths followed by the trick- 
ling water. 

But why purple? And why the 
outline of a man inside a box? 
That was pretty tricky, for a sim- 
ple crack in the wall. And where 
had it gone? 

“ — the eternal conflict with 
the individual who insists on his 
individuality,” Morniel pointed 
out. “Not to mention — ” 

A SERIES OF high musical 
notes sounded, one after the 
other, rapidly. And then, in the 
center of the room, about two 
feet above the floor this time, 



the purple lines reappeared — 
still hazy, still transparent and 
still with the outline of a man 
inside. 

Morniel swung his feet off the 
bed and stared up at it. “What 
the — ” he began. 

Once more, the outfit disap- 
peared. 

“W-what — ” Morniel stuttered. 
“What’s going on?” 

“I don’t know,” I told him. 
“But whatever it is, I’d say 
they’re slowly zeroing in.” 

Again those high musical notes. 
And the purple box came into 
view with its bottom resting on 
the floor. It got darker, darker 
and more substantial. The notes 
kept climbing up the scale and 
getting fainter and fainter until, 
when the box was no longer 
transparent, they faded away al- 
together. 

A door slid back in the box. 
A man stepped out, wearing cloth- 
ing that seemed to end every- 
where in curlicues. 

He looked first at me, then at 
Morniel. 

“Morniel Mathaway?” he in- 
quired. 

“Ye-es,” Morniel said, backing 
away toward his refrigerator. 

“Morniel Mathaway,” the man 
from the box said, “my name is 
Glescu. I bring you greetings 
from 2487 A.D.” 

Neither of us could think of 
a topper for that one, so we let

it lie there. I got up and stood 
beside Morniel, feeling obscurely 
that I wanted to get as close as 
possible to something I was fa- 
miliar with. 

And we all held that position 
for a while. Tableau. 

2487 A.D., I thought to myself. 
I’d never seen anyone dressed 
like that. Even more, I’d never 
imagined anyone dressed like 
that and my imagination can run 
pretty wild. The clothing was not 
exactly transparent and yet not 
quite opaque. Prismatic is the 
word for it, different colors that 
constantly chased themselves in 
and out and around the curlicues. 
There seemed to be a pattern to 
it, but nothing that my eyes 
could hold down and identify. 

And the man himself, this Mr. 
Glescu, was about the same 
height as Morniel and me and 
he seemed to be not very much 
older. But there was a something 
about him — I don’t know, call 
it quality, true and tremendous 
quality — that would have cowed 
the Duke of Wellington. Civil- 
ized, maybe that’s the word: he 
was the most civilized-looking 
man I’d ever seen. 

He stepped forward. “We will 
now,” he said in a rich, wonder- 
fully resonant voice, “indulge in 
the twentieth-century custom of 
shaking hands.” 

So we indulged in the twenti- 
eth-century custom of shaking 

50 



hands with him. First Morniel, 
then me — - and both very gin- 
gerly. Mr. Glescu shook hands 
with a peculiar awkwardness that 
made me think of the way an 
Iowan farmer might eat with 
chopsticks for the first time. 

The ceremony over, he stood 
there and beamed at us. Or, 
rather, at Morniel. 

“What a moment, eh?” he said. 
“What a supreme moment!” 

1%/TORNIEL took a deep breath 
and I knew that all those 
years of meeting process servers 
unexpectedly on the stairs had 
begun to pay off. He was recov- 
ering; his mind was beginning to 
work again. 

“How do you mean ‘what a 
moment’?” he asked. “What’s so 
special about it? Are you the — 
the inventor of time travel?” 

Mr. Glescu twinkled with 
laughter. “Me? An inventor? Oh, 
no. No, no! Time travel was in- 
vented by Antoinette Ingeborg 
in — but that was after your 
time. Hardly worth going into at 
the moment, especially since I 
only have half an hour.” 

“Why half an hour?” I asked, 
not so much because I was curi- 
ous as because it seemed like a 
good question. 

“The skindrom can only be 
maintained that long,” he eluci- 
dated. “The skindrom is — well, 
call it the transmitting device 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that enables me to appear in 
your period. There is such an 
enormous expenditure of power 
required that a trip into the past 
is made only once every fifty 
years. The privilege is awarded 
as a sort of Gobel. I hope I have 
the word right. It is Gobel, isn’t 
it? The award made in your 
time?” 

I had a flash. “You wouldn’t 
mean Nobel, by any chance? The 
Nobel Prize?” 

He nodded his head enthusi- 
astically. “That’s it! The Nobel 
Prize. The trip is awarded to out- 
standing scholars as a kind of 
Nobel Prize. Once every fifty 
years — the man selected by the 
gardunax as the most pre-emi- 
nent — that sort of thing. Up to 
now, of course, it’s always gone 
to historians and they’ve frittered 
it away on the Siege of Troy, the 
first atom-bomb explosion at Los 
Alamos, the discovery of America 
— things like that. But this 
year — ” 

“Yes?” Morniel broke in, his 
voice quavering. We were both 
suddenly remembering that Mr. 
Glescu had known his name. 
“What kind of scholar are you?” 

Mr. Glescu made us a slight 
bow with his head, “I am an art 
scholar. My specialty is art his- 
tory. And my special field in art 
history is . .” 

“What?” Morniel demanded, 
his voice no longer quavering, 



but positively screechy. “What is 
your special field?” 

Again a slight bow from Mr. 
Glescu’s head. “You, Mr. Math- 
away. In my own period, I may 
say without much fear of contra- 
diction, I am the greatest living 
authority on the life and works 
of Morniel Mathaway. My spe- 
cial field is you.” 

Morniel went white. He groped 
his way to the bed and sat down 
as if his hips were made of glass. 
He opened his mouth several 
times and couldn’t seem to get 
a sound out. Finally, he gulped, 
clenched his fists and got a grip 
on himself. 

“Do — do you mean,” he man- 
aged to croak at last, “that I’m 
famous? That famous?” 

“Famous? You, my dear sir, 
are beyond fame. You are one of 
the immortals the human race 
has produced. As I put it — 
rather well if I may say so — in 
my last book, Mathaway, the 
Man Who Shaped the Future: 
‘How rarely has it fallen to the 
lot of individual human endeavor 
to — ’” 

“That famous.” The blond 
beard worked the way a child’s 
face does when it’s about to cry. 
“That famous!” 

Hr ■ iHAT famous!” Mr. Glescu 
A assured him. “Who is the 
man with whom modern painting, 
in its full glory, is said to have 



THE DISCOVERY OF MORNIEL MATHAWAY 



51 



definitely begun? Who is the man 
whose designs and special ma- 
nipulations of color have domin- 
ated architecture for the past five 
centuries, who is responsible for 
the arrangement of our cities, the 
shape of our every artifact, the 
very texture of our clothing.” 

“Me?” Morniel inquired weak- 
ly- 

“You! No other man in the 
history of art has exerted such 
a massive influence over design 
or over so wide an area of art for 
so long a period of time. To 
whom can I compare you, sir? 
To what other artist in history 
can I compare you?” 

“Rembrandt?” Morniel sug- 
gested. He seemed to be trying 
to be helpful. “Da Vinci?” 

Mr. Glescu sneered. “Rem- 
brandt and Da Vinci in the same 
breath as you? Ridiculous! They 
lacked your universality, your 
taste for the cosmic, your sense 
of the all-encompassing. No, to 
relate you properly to an equal, 
one must go outside painting, to 
literature, possibly. Shakespeare, 
with his vast breadth of under- 
standing, with the resounding 
organ notes of his poetry and 
with his tremendous influence on 
the later English language — but 
even Shakespeare, I’m afraid, 
even Shakespeare — ” He shook 
his head sadly. 

“Wow!” breathed Morniel 
Mathaway. 

52 



“Speaking of Shakespeare,” I 
broke in, “do you happen to know 
of a poet named David Dant- 
ziger? Did much of his work sur- 
vive?” 

“Is that you?” 

“Yes,” I told the man from 
2487 A.D. eagerly. “That’s me, 
Dave Dantziger.” 

He wrinkled his forehead. “I 
don’t seem to remember any — 
What school of poetry do you 
belong to?” 

“Well, they call it by various 
names. Anti-imagist is the most 
usual one. Anti-imagist or post- 
imagist.” 

“No,” said Mr. Glescu after 
thinking for a while. “The only 
poet I can remember for this 
time and this part of the world is 
Peter Tedd.” 

“Who is Peter Tedd? Never 
heard of him.” 

“Then this must be before he 
was discovered. But please re- 
member, I am an art scholar, not 
a literary one. It is entirely possi- 
ble,” he went on soothingly, “that 
were you to mention your name 
to a specialist in the field of 
minor twentieth-century versifi- 
ers, he could place you with a 
minimum of difficulty. Entirely 
possible.” 

I glanced at Morniel, and he 
was grinning at me from the bed. 
He had entirely recovered by 
now and was beginning to soak 
the situation in through his pores. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The whole situation. His stand- 
ing. Mine. 

I decided I hated every single 
one of his guts. 

HY DID it have to be some- 
one like Morniel Matha- 
way that got that kind of nod 
from fate? There were so many 
painters who were decent human 
beings, and yet this bragging 
slug . 

And all the time, a big part of 
my mind was wandering around 
in circles. It just proved, I kept 
saying to myself, that you need 
the perspective of history to 
properly evaluate anything in art. 
You think of all the men who 
were big guns in their time and 
today are forgotten — that con- 
temporary of Beethoven’s, for 
example, who, while he was alive, 
was considered much the greater 
man, and whose name is known 
today only to musicologists. But 
still — 

Mr. Glescu glanced at the fore- 
finger of his right hand where a 
little black dot constantly ex- 
panded and contracted. “My time 
is getting short,” he said. “And 
while it is an ineffable, over- 
whelming delight for me to be 
standing in your studio, Mr. 
Mathaway, and looking at you at 
last in the flesh, I wonder if you 
would mind obliging me with a 
small favor?” 

“Sure,” Morniel nodded, get- 



ting up. “You name it. Nothing’s 
too good for you. What do you 
want?” 

Mr. Glescu swallowed as if he 
were about to bring himself to 
knock on the gates of Paradise. 
“I wonder — I’m sure you don’t 
mind — could you possibly let 
me look at the painting you’re 
working on at the moment? The 
idea of seeing a Mathaway in an 
unfinished state, with the paint 
still wet upon it — ” He shut his 
eyes, as if he couldn’t believe 
that all this were really happen- 
ing to him. 

Morniel gestured urbanely and 
strode to his easel. He pulled the 
tarp off. “I intend to call this — ” 
and his voice had grown as oily 
as the subsoil of Texas — “Fig- 
ured Figurines No. 29.” 

Slowly, tastingly, Mr. Glescu 
opened his eyes and leaned for- 
ward. “But — ” he said, after a 
long silence. “Surely this isn’t 
your work, Mr. Mathaway?” 
Morniel turned around in sur- 
prise and considered the painting. 
“It’s my work, all right. Figured 
Figurines No. 29. Recognize it?” 
“No,” said Mr. Glescu. “I do 
not recognize it. And that is a 
fact for which I am extremely 
grateful. Could I see something 
else, please? Something a little 
later?” 

“That’s the latest,” Morniel 
told him a little uncertainly. 
“Everything else is earlier. Here, 




THE DISCOVERY OF MORNIEL MATHAWAY

you might like this.” He pulled 
a painting out of the rack. “I call 
this Figured Figurines No. 22. I 
think it’s the best of my early 
period.” 

1VTR. GLESCU shuddered. “It 
-*-*-*■ looks like smears of paint 
on top of other smears of paint.” 

“Right! Only I call it smudge- 
on-smudge. But you probably 
know all that, being such an 
authority on me. And here’s Fig- 
ured Figurines No. — ” 

“Do you mind leaving these 
— these figurines, Mr. Matha- 
way?” Glescu begged. “I’d like 
to see something of yours with 
color. With color and with form!” 

Morniel scratched his head. “I 
haven’t done any real color work 
for a long time. Oh, wait!” He 
brightened and began to search 
in the back of the rack. He came 
out with an old canvas. “This is 
one of the few examples of my 
mauve-and-mottled period that 
I’ve kept.” 

“I can’t imagine why,” Mr. 
Glescu murmured, mostly to him- 
self. “It’s positively — ” He 
brought his shoulders up to his 
ears in the kind of shrug that 
anyone who’s ever seen an art 
critic in action can immediately 
recognize. You don’t need words 
after that shrug; if you’re a paint- 
er whose work he’s looking at, 
you don’t want words. 

About this time, Morniel be- 



gan pulling paintings out frantic- 
ally. He’d show them to Glescu, 
who would gurgle as if he were 
forcing down a retch, and pull 
out some more paintings. 

“I don’t understand it,” Mr. 
Glescu said, staring at the floor, 
which was strewn with canvases 
tacked to their wooden stretchers. 
“This was obviously before you 
discovered yourself and your true 
technique. But I’m looking for a 
sign, a hint, of the genius that is 
to come. And I find — ” He shook 
his head dazedly. 

“How about this one?” Morniel 
asked, breathing hard. 

Mr. Glescu shoved at it with 
both hands. “Please take it away!” 
He looked at his forefinger again. 
I noticed the black dot was ex- 
panding and contracting much 
more slowly. “I’ll have to leave 
soon,” he said. “And I don’t under- 
stand at all. Let me show you 
something, gentlemen.” 

H E WALKED into the purple 
box and came out with a 
book. He beckoned to us. Morniel 
and I moved around behind him 
and stared over his shoulder. The 
pages tinkled peculiarly as they 
were turned; one thing I knew 
for sure — they weren’t made out 
of paper. And the title-page . 

The Complete Paintings of 
Morniel Mathaway, 1928-1996. 

“Were you born in 1928?” I 
demanded. 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Morniel nodded. “May 23, 
1928.” And he was silent. I knew 
what he was thinking about and 
did a little quick figuring. Sixty- 
eight years. It’s not given to many 
men to know exactly how much 
time they have. Sixty-eight years 
— that wasn’t so bad. 

Mr. Glescu turned to the first 
of the paintings. 

Even now, when I remember 
my initial sight of it, my knees 
get weak and bend inward. It 
was an abstraction in full color, 
but such an abstraction as I’d 
never imagined before. As if all 
the work of all the abstraction- 
ists up to this point had been an 
appenticeship on the kindergarten 
level. 

You had to like it — so 
long as you had eyes — whether 
or not your appreciation had 
been limited to representational 
painting until now; even if, in 
fact, you’d never particularly 
cared about painting of any 
school. 

I don’t want to sound maudlin, 
but I actually felt tears in my 
eyes. Anyone who was at all sen- 
sitive to beauty would have re- 
acted the same way. 

Not Morniel, though. “Oh, that 
kind of stuff,” he said as if a great 
light had broken on him. “Why 
didn’t you tell me you wanted 
that kind of stuff?” 

Mr. Glescu clutched at Mor- 
niel’s dirty tee-shirt. “Do you 



mean you have paintings like 
this, too?” 

“Not paintings — painting. 
Just one. I did it last week as a 
sort of experiment, but I wasn’t 
satisfied with the way it turned 
out, so I gave it to the girl down- 
stairs. Care to take a look at it?” 
“Oh, yes! Very, very much!” 
Morniel reached for the book 
and tossed it casually on the bed. 
“Okay,” he said. “Come on. It 
won’t take more than a minute 
or two.” 

A S WE trooped downstairs, I 
found myself boiling with 
perplexity. One thing I was sure 
of — as sure as of the fact that 
Geoffrey Chaucer had lived be- 
fore Algernon Swinburne — noth- 
ing that Morniel had ever done 
or had the capacity of ever doing 
could come within a million es- 
thetic miles of the reproduction 
in that book. And for all of his 
boasting, for all of his seemingly 
inexhaustible conceit, I was cer- 
tain that he also knew it. 

He stopped before a door two 
floors below and rapped on it. 
There was no answer. He waited 
a few seconds and knocked again. 
Still no answer. 

“Damn,” he said. “She isn’t 
home. And I did want you to see 
that one.” 

“I want to see it,” Mr. Glescu 
told him earnestly. “I want to 
see anything that looks like your 



THE DISCOVERY OF MORNIEL MATHAWAY

mature work. But time is grow- 
ing so short — ■” 

Morniel snapped his fingers. 
“Tell you what. Anita has a 
couple of cats she asks me to 
feed whenever she’s away for a 
while, so she’s given me a key 
to her apartment. Suppose I whip 
upstairs and get it?” 

“Fine!” Mr. Glescu said happi- 
ly, taking a quick look at his 
forefinger. “But please hurry.” 
“Will do.” And then, as Mor- 
niel turned to go up the stairs, 
he caught my eye. And he gave 
me the signal, the one we use 
whenever we go “shopping.” It 
meant: “Talk to the man. Keep 
him interested.” 

I got it. The book. I’d seen 
Morniel in action far too many 
times not to remember that casu- 
al gesture of tossing it on the bed 
as anything but a casual gesture. 
He’d just put it where he could 
find it when he wanted it — fast. 
He was going upstairs to hide it 
in some unlikely spot and when 
Mr. Glescu had to take off for 
his own time — well, the book 
would just not be available. 

Smooth? Very pretty damned 
smooth, I’d say. And Morniel 
Mathaway would paint the paint- 
ings of Morniel Mathaway. Only 
he wouldn’t paint them. 

He’d copy them. 

Meanwhile, the signal snapped 
my mouth open and automatic- 
ally started me talking.

“Do you paint yourself, Mr. 
Glescu?” I asked. I knew that 
would be a good gambit. 

“Oh, no! Of course, I wanted 
to be an artist when I was a boy 
— I imagine every critic starts 
out that way — and I even com- 
mitted a few daubs of my own. 
But they were very bad, very 
bad indeed! I found it far easier 
to write about paintings than to 
do them. Once I began reading 
the life of Morniel Mathaway, I 
knew I’d found my field. Not only 
did I empathize closely with his 
paintings, but he seemed so much 
like a person I could have known 
and liked. That’s one of the 
things that puzzles me. He’s 
quite different from what I 
imagined.” 

I nodded. “I bet he is.” 

“Of course history has a way 
of adding stature and romance to 
any important figure. And I can 
see several things about his per- 
sonality that the glamorizing pro- 
cess of the centuries could — 
but I shouldn’t go on in this 
fashion, Mr. Dantziger. You’re 
his friend.” 

“About as much of a friend as 
he’s got in the world,” I told 
him, “which isn’t saying much.” 

A ND ALL the time I was try- 
ing to figure it out. But the 
more I figured, the more confused 
I got. The paradoxes in the thing. 
How could Morniel Mathaway 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



become famous five hundred 
years from now by painting pic- 
tures that he first saw in a book 
published five hundred years 
from now? Who painted the pic- 
tures? Morniel Mathaway? The 
book said so, and with the book 
in his possession, he would cer- 
tainly do them. But he’d be copy- 
ing them out of the book. So who 
painted the original pictures? 

Mr. Glescu looked worriedly at 
his forefinger. “I’m running out 
of time — practically none left!” 

He sped up the stairs, with me 
behind him. When we burst into 
the studio, I braced myself for 
the argument over the book. I 
wasn’t too happy about it, be- 
cause I liked Mr. Glescu. 

The book wasn’t there; the bed 
was empty. And two other things 
weren’t there — the time ma- 
chine and Morniel Mathaway. 

•“He left in it!” Mr. Glescu 
gasped. “He stranded me here! 
He must have figured out that 
getting inside and closing the 
door made it return!” 

“Yeah, he’s a great figurer,” I 
said bitterly. This I hadn’t bar- 
gained for. This I wouldn’t have 
helped to bring about. “And he’ll 
probably figure out a very plausi- 
ble story to tell the people in 
your time to explain how the 
whole thing happened. Why- 
should he work his head off in 
the twentieth century when he 
can be an outstanding, hero-wor- 



shipped celebrity in the twenty- 
fifth?” 

“But what will happen if they 
ask him to paint merely one pic- 
ture — ” 

“He’ll probably tell them he’s 
already done his work and feels 
he can no longer add anything 
of importance to it. He’ll no doubt 
end up giving lectures on himself. 
Don’t worry, he’ll make out. It’s 
you I’m worried about. You’re 
stuck here. Are they likely to 
send a rescue party after you?” 

Mr. Glescu shook his head 
miserably. “Every scholar who 
wins the award has to sign a 
waiver of responsibility, in case 
he doesn’t return. The machine 
may be used only once in fifty 
years — and by that time, some 
other scholar will claim and be 
given the right to witness the 
storming of the Bastille, the birth 
of Gautama Buddha or some- 
thing of the sort. No, I’m stuck 
here, as you phrased it. Is it very 
bad, living in this period?” 

I slapped him on the shoulder. 
I was feeling very guilty. “Not 
so bad. Of course, you’ll need a 
social security card, and I don’t 
know how you go about getting 
one at your age. And possibly — 
I don’t know for sure — the 
F.B.I. or Immigration authorities 
may want to question you, since 
you’re an illegal alien, kind of.” 

He looked appalled. “Oh, dear! 
That’s quite bad enough!” 



THE DISCOVERY OF MORNIEL MATHAWAY 



57 



A ND THEN I got the idea. 

“No, it needn’t be. Tell you 
what. Morniel has a social secur- 
ity card — he had a job a couple 
of years ago. And he keeps his 
birth certificate in that bureau 
drawer along with other personal 
papers. Why don’t you just as- 
sume his identity? He’ll never 
show you up as an imposter!” 
“Do you think I could? Won’t 
I be — won’t his friends — his 
relatives — ” 

“Parents both dead, no relatives 
I ever heard about. And I told 
you I’m the closest thing to a 
friend he’s got.” I examined Mr. 
Glescu thoughtfully. “You could 
get away with it. Maybe grow a 
beard and dye it blond. Things 
like that. Naturally, the big prob- 
lem would be earning a living. 
Being a specialist on Mathaway 
and the art movements that de- 
rived from him wouldn’t get you 
fed an awful lot right now.” 

He grabbed at me. “I could 
paint! I’ve always dreamed of 
being a painter! I don’t have 
much talent, but there are all 
sorts of artistic novelties I know 
about, all kinds of graphic inno- 
vations that don’t exist in your 
time. Surely that would be 
enough — even without talent 
— to make a living for me on 
some third- or fourth-rate level!” 
It was. It certainly was. But 
not on the third- or fourth-rate 
level. On the first. Mr. Glescu- 

58 



Morniel Mathaway is the finest 
painter alive today. And the un- 
happiest. 

“What’s the matter with these 
people?” he asked me wildly af- 
ter his last exhibition. “Praising 
me like that! I don’t have an 
ounce of real talent in me; all my 
work, all, is completely deriva- 
tive. I’ve tried to do something, 
anything, that was completely my 
own, but I’m so steeped in Matha- 
way that I just can’t seem to 
make my own personality come 
through. And those idiotic critics 
go on raving about me — and 
the work isn’t even my own!” 

“Then whose is it?” I wanted 
to know. 

“Mathaway’s, of course,” he 
said bitterly. “We thought there 
couldn’t be a time paradox — I 
wish you could read all the scien- 
tific papers on the subject; they 
fill whole libraries — because it 
isn’t possible, the time specialists 
argue, for a painting, say, to be 
copied from a future reproduc- 
tion and so have no original artist. 
But that’s what I’m doing! I’m 
copying from that book by 
memory!” 9 

I wish I could tell him the 
truth — he’s such a nice guy, 
especially compared to the real 
fake of a Mathaway, and he suf- 
fers so much. 

But I can’t. 

You see, he’s deliberately try- 
ing not to copy those paintings. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He’s working so hard at it that 
he refuses to think about that 
book or even discuss it. I finally 
got him to recently, for a few 
sentences, and you know what? 
He doesn’t actually remember, 
except pretty hazily! 

Of course he wouldn’t — he’s 
the real Morniel Mathaway and 
there is no paradox. But if I ever 



told him that he was actually 
painting the pictures instead of 
merely copying them from mem- 
ory, he’d lose whatever little self- 
confidence he has. So I have to 
let him think he’s a phony when 
he’s nothing of the sort. 

“Forget it,” I go on telling him. 
“A buck’s a buck.”

FORECAST 

An editor who holds his breath until a James H. Schmitz story is delivered is apt to 
turn pretty blue in the face, for he is one of the most meticulous writers in the business. 
That's why the announcement of his two-part serial THE TIES OF EARTH, starting in next 
month's issue, is important news. It's a literary sizzler, with lots of deadly action going 
on all the time — or is it? That, you see, is why you'll sweat with Commager, who is 
— or is he? — experiencing these confusing and terrifying catastrophes. What was 
happening to him did worse than make no sense; it made altogether too much sense! 
But what was true and what was not? 

There'll be no less than one nove'et, WITH REDFERN ON CAPELLA XII by Charles 
Satterfield. Like most of us, Redfern is a properly wary fellow, especially on a world as 
dangerous as the twelfth planet of Capella, as who wouldn't be? Well, the people he 
falls in with, for instance, literally almost over his own dead body. But the lesson Redfern 
passes on to us is a valuable one: Don't get mixed up with fearless adventurers cast in 
the heroic mold; they can really put on the squeeze! 

Short stories, of course — all we can cram into the issue; Willy Ley's FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION; editorial and — well, let Groff Conklin tell you himself: "And so, friends, 
after five years of reviewing for Galaxy, I say 'Au revoir.' I'm off for a long trip to the 
West Coast and then down to the Virgin Islands, where I am now, by gar, a bloated 
landowner! (The land isn't bloated by any means, being only fifteen gorgeous acres; I 
am — by pride and satisfaction.) It's been a fine five years, but now I turn the column 
over to Floyd C. Gale; he did some s-f writing years back and a great deal of reading 
since about 1929, has excellent taste and an easy, witty style. You'll like him. I do."

THE HOW OF SPACE TRAVEL 

D URING THE interval 
which must elapse be- 
tween the writing of this 
column and its appearance on 
the newsstands, Walt Disney’s 
Man in Space will have had its 
second showing on television. 
Naturally I do not know how 
many viewers will tune in on the 
repeat showing, but the audience 
for the premiere, in March of this 
year, was around forty million. 
This, I may add in the very

in which Willy Ley explains the principle of the instrument 
carrier to artists Svendsen and O'Connor, was used in the film. 



strictest confidence, was higher 
than we thought it would be 
while we were planning and mak- 
ing the film. 

As far as I am concerned, it 
began with a long distance call 
from Hollywood — just as in the 
movies — asking me to come out 
and act as adviser. No notice 
was offered, but I did have to 
ask for three days because I was 
slated to appear at a cocktail 



party given by the New York 
Herald Tribune where I was to 
receive the prize my book Engi- 
neers’ Dreams had just won. 

The timing of flights was such, 
at that time, that I could not 
attend the party, go home for 
my luggage and catch the non- 
stop transcontinental DC-7 after- 
ward. What I could do was to 
take a flight from LaGuardia to 
Chicago and catch a non-stop

DC-7 for the West Coast at mid- 
flight in Chicago. Needless to say, 
flying all night, even as a passen- 
ger, is not conducive to alertness. 

W/'HEN I SAT in the beauti- 
ful air-conditioned studios 
of Walt Disney Productions in 
Burbank, California, I mentally 
weighed the problems involved. 
A nationwide network television 
show would have millions of 

62 



viewers — especially if it had 
Disney’s name attached to it — 
which meant that we must take 
nothing for granted. Writing such 
a script — at that moment, I 
still thought a script had to be 
written — would be entirely dif- 
ferent from writing for publica- 
tion, where you can take some 
things for granted. 

A man who spends five dollars 
for a book is obviously willing 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and probably eager to read it. 
Furthermore, he is reasonably 
solvent — or, if not, he is all the 
more interested in the subject 
matter — and he must have had 
a fair amount of education, for 
very few uneducated people buy 
books. Similarly, in writing this 
column, I can assume that every 
reader is interested in science 
and science fiction. But with a 
television audience of millions, 
all getting a free show, no such 
assumption could be made. Ob- 
viously everything had to be ex- 
plained right from scratch. 

On the other hand, the most 
instructive device invented so far 
was at our disposal: the animated 
cartoon. We would not have to 
explain with words, as I do in 
lectures; we could show how 
things work. As a means of visual 
instruction, this was superior 
even to ordinary film. 

Sitting down with Ward Kim- 
ball, the director of the film, and 
his group of artists, I had the 
procedure explained to me. They 
don’t have “scripts” at Disney’s, 
at least not in the customary 
meaning of the word. 

The “working scripts” are story 
boards, as they are called, large 
boards in wooden frames on 
which the sequence to be shown 
is pinned up with push pins. 
What goes on the first story board 
may be almost anything, quick 
sketches, photographs if they

happen to be around, even pic- 
tures clipped from magazines. 
The boards are gradually refined 
and improved, the words which 
may be on the sound track are 
written down and also pinned 
up, and after what looks like a 
minimum of a thousand changes 
and after approval by Walt Dis- 
ney, this narration finally does 
become a kind of script. It is 
actually typed out to be recorded 
on the sound track. 

The very first problem was 
not so much what to put on the 
story boards, but what to leave 
out. At first, the idea had been 
to show the present concept of 
the Universe and of the Solar

System in particular, then to 
trace the story of the idea of 
space travel in old science fiction 
to the present, and finally to tell 
how today’s experts think space 



travel can be brought about, the 
climax being a rocket flight to 
the Moon or to Mars. 

’l/'ERY LITTLE of these first 
" story boards survived the dis- 
cussions with the experts, not be- 
cause it was wrong in any way, 
but because each expert dumped 
an hours’ worth of additional in- 
formation into the debate. 

Dr. Heinz Haber delivered 
several fine lectures on problems 
of space medicine. Dr. Wernher 
von Braun, when turned loose on 
engineering detail, could go on 
until stopped by darkness or 
other appointments. As for me, I 
talked for about a week on the 
history of rocket research and 
the fundamental principles in- 
volved. I don’t know just what 
had been expected of the experts 
before they arrived; what we 
did do was to turn offices and 
sketch rooms into classrooms and 
apparently everybody was very 
pleased. 

The result of this large-scale 
influx of information was that 
Walt Disney first split the origi- 
nal first show into two and then 
authorized another split so that 
we worked on three shows in- 
stead of one. 

The first, Man in Space, com- 
prised history up to now, the 
problems of space medicine — 
the section where the Disney 
crew really let fly, it being the

only section where humor was 
possible — and the immediate 
future, as embodied in the von 
Braun plan. The second film will 
show the building of the space 
station and the trip around the 
Moon (without landing). The 
trip to Mars, at first thought to 
be merely the climax of the pic- 
ture, will be a show in itself. 

When it came to the more de- 
tailed story boards, a new set of 
problems arose. The history was 
comparatively simple. Of the 
earliest Chinese rockets of 1230 



A.D. and thereafter, not much 
more is known than that they 
existed. This left free rein for 
Ward Kimball and his crew to 
draw entertaining pictures. Of the 
later rockets, contemporary pic- 
tures are available, so we used 
these, although they often had to 
be redrawn to show up well on 
a television screen. (Let me in- 
sert here that the original film is 
in color, for foreign releases and 
possible theatrical showing in 
this country.) Of the most mod- 
ern rockets, films are available,

though they are sometimes not 
easy to come by. 

An interesting little item was 
a film showing the (unsuccess- 
ful) takeoff of one of the earliest 
V-2 rockets at Peenemiinde, Ger- 
many. When we screened the 
section, Wernher von Braun nat- 
urally recognized the film, for he 
had been there when it was taken. 
But he had been certain that this 
had been a silent film and yet 
the typical thunder of the V-2 
motor came out of the loudspeak- 
er. The solution of the puzzle 



was very simple, of course — 
one V-2 sounds like another and 
the sound was “courtesy White 
Sands Proving Grounds.” 

T>UT I WAS speaking about 
the problems of explaining 
fundamentals. The most basic 
point of space travel is, of course, 
that the thrust of a rocket is in- 
dependent of its surroundings; in 
other words, that the rocket will 
work in air, under water and also 
in a vacuum. 

The rocket does not move be-

66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




cause the exhaust blast “pushes 
against the air.” Then again, you 
can’t say that it does not “push 
against the air,” for if there is 
air around, it obviously cannot 
help doing so. The point is that 
this is not what causes the mo- 
tion. What does cause the mo- 
tion is that backward thrust pro- 
duces forward movement. But 
how to show this? 

Now it is a fact that you can 
propel yourself in a canoe on a 
quiet lake if you have a supply 
of rocks with you and throw them 
as hard as you can to the rear. 
But we were not sure whether 
this would make a good picture. 

Another obvious fact is that a 
gun kicks back and that there is 
no reason to think that it wouldn’t 
kick back when fired in a vacuum. 
One of the early story boards 
contained sketches of a machine 
gun mounted on a small railroad 
car, the machine gun firing over 
the tail end of the car, accelerat- 
ing it in the opposite direction. 
Then somebody pinned up a 
sketch of a little dog sneezing 
violently. This one was used, 
along with a general explanation 
of “action” and “reaction” by 
means of the animated cartoon. 

It all made two other prob- 
lems which I know to be “tough” 
from lecture experience easy to 
explain. 

In the solid fuel rocket, you 
have a stick of powder that 



burns off, producing quantities of 
exhaust gases that escape at high 
speed through the rearward noz- 
zle like millions of molecular 
bullets, producing thrust. The 
tube that houses the powder 
stick must naturally be able to 
stand the strain and the heat of 
combustion. It does so mostly by 
virtue of the fact that the burn- 
ing time of a solid-fuel rocket is 
usually less than a second. 

But in the liquid-fuel rocket, 
this compact device has been, so 
to speak, taken apart. In place 
of the powder mixture, you have 
two liquids in separate tanks, one 
the fuel proper, the other a liquid 
providing oxygen for combustion. 
Instead of burning the fuel in the 
tank which contains it, it has to 
be forced into a combustion 
chamber either by gas pressure 
on the liquids or else by means 
of fuel pumps. 

So far, there is no special prob- 
lem. But the liquid-fuel rocket 
motor has to last for a full minute 
or more and the flame produced 
by the liquid fuels is usually hot- 
ter than that of solid fuels. At 
any event, the temperature of the 
flame is far above the melting 
point of the metal. 

The way out of this dilemma 
is to put a cooling jacket around 
the combustion chamber and the 
exhaust nozzle and to send one 
of the two liquids, usually the 
fuel, through this cooling jacket 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



67 



before it is injected into the 
motor for burning. 

AS I SAID, I know from lec- 
J -*- ture experience that a non- 
technical audience has a good 
deal of trouble understanding 
this solution. I don’t know 
whether it is the idea of using a 
fuel for cooling that is so novel 
— after all, anybody should 
know that a drum of gasoline 
left in the garage on a cold win- 
ter’s night is mighty cold and 
yet is still fuel. Or possibly a 
non-technical audience just can- 
not visualize how the liquid flows 
from the tank through the pumps 
into the distributing pipes and 
the cooling jacket to the injec- 
tion nozzles. 

But when it was shown in ani- 
mated diagrams on the screen, 
nobody failed to grasp it literally 
at a glance. 

The other “tough” problem 
has to do with the artificial satel- 
lite. A Viking rocket will climb 
to 158 miles and then fall back. 
The WAC Corporal rocket of 
“Project Bumper” climbed to 250 
miles and then fell back. But the 
artificial satellite is supposed to 
stay in space, and when you say 
this, you get the inevitable ques- 
tion, “What holds it up?” 

The correct and truthful an- 
swer is that the artificial satel- 
lite will stay in space because it 
is a satellite, but that does not 



sound like an answer to most 
people. In explanation by word 
of mouth, you usually have to 
resort to the comparison of a 
stone tied to a string swinging in 
a circle and say that centrifugal 
force counter balances the Earth’s 
gravitational attraction. 

In the film, we could show 
what happens — namely, that it 
is the Earth’s gravitational pull 
which keeps the artificial satellite 
in a closed orbit. We first showed 
what would happen if the Earth’s 
gravity did not exist: The rocket, 
rising at a slant, would simply 
keep going and escape into space. 
But then a set of lines represent- 
ing gravity was drawn in, show- 
ing how gravity bends the other- 
wise straight line of the rocket’s 
path into a closed orbit. 

A NOTHER “toughie” which 
belonged in Dr. Heinz Ha- 
ber’s sequence on space medicine 
also has to do with gravity. With 
only a negligible number of ex- 
ceptions, all citizens, resident 
aliens and temporary visitors are 
convinced that they can feel 
gravity. The plain truth is that 
they can’t. 

What they feel when standing 
up or sitting down is the effect 
of resisting the pull of gravity 
which appears in the sensation 
of weight. If they did not resist, 
they would, of course, fall, but 
while falling they’d feel weight- 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



less. Which proves two things, 
first that you can be deep in a 
powerful gravitational field and 
still feel weightless, and second 
that you cannot feel the gravity 
itself, but only the effect of re- 
sisting its pull. 

On the screen, this was shown 
in the form of an outline eleva- 
tor happily occupied by Mr. 
Average Man who, to his great 
surprise, begins to feel weightless 
and float as Fate, represented by 
a huge pair of scissors, cuts the 
ropes. 

Having told the history of 
rockets, shown the rockets prob- 
ing beyond the stratosphere, ex- 
plained why a rocket will work 
in empty space, demonstrated 
what happens in a rocket motor, 
illustrated the principle of the 
artificial satellite and given a 
quick course in space medicine, 
our next job was to go into the 
future for just a few years. 

The first goal of liquid-fuel 
rocket research was to make one 
rise off the ground. Once that 
was accomplished, the goal may 
be called the altitude record, al- 
though I am fully aware that this 
is a gross oversimplication and 
that the actual altitude record is 
merely a part, and not the most 
important part, of the goal. The 
unmanned artificial satellite will 
be the next long step forward, 
but the ultimate goal is to get 
Man into space. 



The first steps have already 
been made. Pilots have flown 
twice the speed of sound at high 
altitudes and piloted rocket-pro- 
pelled airplanes have beaten the 
high-altitude record held for so 
many years by the manned 
stratosphere balloon Explorer II. 
In fact, it has now been revealed 
that a piloted plane has gone to 
100,000 feet, a height where no 
rudder, elevator or aileron does 
much good any more. Space, 
however, is beyond that. And to 
go that far, the rocket-propelled 
airplane will need rocket boost- 
ers. 

A GAIN, the medium of the 
animated cartoon made it 
easy to show just how such a 
project would be approached. If 
you have the finished rocket ship 
in mind, the work begins at the 
top of the whole thing. The top 
is a rocket-propelled airplane 
with sealed cabin. It would be 
built first and go through the 
customary series of tests, being 
towed by a big jet plane, with- 
out using any power of its own. 
Having been disconnected from 
the towing plane, the pilot would 
make glide landings. 

After all this has worked to 
everybody’s full satisfaction, a 
takeoff must be made with one 
rocket booster, followed by pow- 
ered flight, unpowered glide and 
landing. Then the plane, which 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



69 



by then has become the top stage 
of a multi-stage rocket ship, 
would make a rather long flight 
with two rocket boosters pushing 
it in succession. 

Finally, the whole ship would 
be assembled and be readied for 
“the flight” — the flight into 
space where the top stage (the 
“plane”) circles the Earth a few 
times until the pilot reduces its 
speed by firing the forward rocket 
motors. The reduced speed will 
then make it change to another 
orbit, part of which is inside the 
atmosphere. And once the ship 
has entered the atmosphere, air 
resistance will reduce the speed 
more and more. 

I want to interrupt my story 
here for two explanations. The 
rocket ship (Fig. 4 shows a photo- 
graph of the model) used in the 
film is Dr. Wernher von Braun’s 
most recent design and consti- 
tutes a decided improvement 
over the original three-stage ship 
which he first described in his 
book The Mars Project. 

It is not only lighter and small- 
er than the first design, but also 
differs in concept in several re- 
spects. However, I can’t dwell on 
questions of detail until the de- 
signer has published it himself 
in a professional journal first. 

The other thing I want to point 
out has to do with the meeting 
in space of this ship with the 
nose cone of the instrument- 

70 



carrying rocket. 

The meeting as shown in the 
film is correct insofar as the in- 
strument carrier was stated to 
have been put into an orbit lead- 
ing over both poles of the Earth. 
The manned ship was assumed 
to circle the Earth temporarily 
in the same orbit in which the 
space station is to be built at a 
later date. This would put the 
ship at a distance of 1075 miles 
from the ground. And though 
there may be an instrument car- 
rier at that distance, it would 
not be the first one, which would 
be sent into an orbit much nearer 
the ground. 

T HE DETAILS of that first 
flight were worked out with 
all the care of which everybody 
involved was capable. A lot of 
data that would never show in 
the film was worked out just the 
same to see where it would lead. 

At one point, von Braun and 
I forgot in an interesting manner 
what we were really doing. It had 
been suggested that ground con- 
trol should have an instrument 
which would show the position 
of the manned ship at any time 
during its flight. The instrument, 
somebody said, might be a globe 
of the Earth, with a ring of trans- 
parent plastic around it, repre- 
senting the orbit. But this ring 
should touch the ground, for it 
was to show takeoff and landing, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



too. The position of the ship 
could be indicated by a moving 
spot of light in the ring of trans- 
parent plastic. 

This sounded fine and von 
Braun mused, “Now how would 
one build that?” whereupon we 
started debating how one might 
go about it. After a few minutes, 
one of the artists brought us down 
to sea level with the remark: 
“You know, here at Disney’s, we 
just draw things.” 

Well, this-- is the story of how 
a very large portion of the public 
of the United States and Canada 



got to see a first lesson in the 
principles of space travel, or 
rather of the beginnings of space 
travel, the first step outside the 
atmosphere. 

I am quite sure that a decade 
from now, lecturers will rent 
copies of the film to explain to 
their audiences how prediction 
differed from reality. 

I hope they won’t forget to 
mention that prediction is one 
of the causes of reality. That’s 
true of research. It’s also true of 
science fiction.

Bolden's Pets 

By F. L. WALLACE 

The price of life was a life 
for a life — which was all the 
reward the victim looked for! 



H IS HANDS were shaking 
as he exhibited the gifts. 
If he were on Earth, he 
would be certain it was the flu; 
in the Centaurus system, krank- 
en. But this was Van Daamas, 
so Lee Bolden couldn’t say what 
he had. Man hadn’t been here 
long enough to investigate the 
diseases with any degree of thor- 
oughness. There were always dif- 
ferent hazards to overcome as 
new planets were settled. 

But whatever infection he had, 
Bolden was not greatly concerned 
as he counted out the gifts. He 



had felt the onset of illness per- 
haps an hour before. When he 
got back to the settlement he’d 
be taken care of. That was half 
a day’s flight from here. The base 
was equipped with the best medi- 
cal facilities that had been de- 
vised. 

He stacked up the gifts to 
make an impressive show: five 
pairs of radar goggles, seven 
high-velocity carbines, seven 
boxes of ammunition. This was 
the natives’ own rule and was 
never to be disregarded — it 
had to be an odd number of gifts.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The Van Daamas native gazed 
impassively at the heap. He car- 
ried a rather strange bow and a 
quiver was strapped to his thigh. 
With one exception, the arrows 
were brightly colored, mostly red 
and yellow. Bolden supposed this 
was for easy recovery in case the 
shot missed. But there was al- 
ways one arrow that was stained 
dark blue. Bolden had observed 
this before — no native was ever 
without that one somber-looking 
arrow. 

The man of Van Daamas stood 
there and the thin robe that was 
no protection against the ele- 
ments rippled slightly in the chill 
current of air that flowed down 
the mountainside. “I will go talk 
with the others,” he said in Eng- 
lish. 

“Go talk,” said Bolden, trying 
not to shiver. He replied in native 
speech, but a few words ex- 
hausted his knowledge and he 
had to revert to his own lan- 
guage. “Take the gifts with you. 
They are yours, no matter what 
you decide.” 

The native nodded and reached 
for a pair of goggles. He tried 
them on, looking out over fog 
and mist-shrouded slopes. These 
people of Van Daamas needed 
radar less than any race Bolden 
knew of. Living by preference in 
mountains, they had developed a 
keenness of vision that enabled 
them to see through the perpetual 



fog and mist far better than any 
Earthman. Paradoxically it was 
the goggles they appreciated 
most. Extending their sight 
seemed more precious to them 
than powerful carbines. 

The native shoved the goggles 
up on his forehead, smiling with 
pleasure. Noticing that Bolden 
was shivering, he took his hands 
and examined them. “Hands 
sick?” he queried. 

“A little,” said Bolden. “I’ll be 
all right in the morning.” 

The . native gathered up the 
gifts. “Go talk,” he repeated as 
he went away. 

T EE BOLDEN sat in the cop- 
ter and waited. He didn’t 
know how much influence this 
native had with his people. He 
had come to negotiate, but this 
might have been because he un- 
derstood English somewhat better 
than the others. 

A council of the natives would 
make the decision about working 
for the Earthmen’s settlement. If 
they approved of the gifts, they 
probably would. There was noth- 
ing to do now but wait — and 
shiver. His hands were getting 
numb and his feet weren’t much 
better. 

Presently the native came out 
of the fog carrying a rectangular 
wicker basket. Bolden was de- 
pressed when he saw it. One gift 
in return for goggles, carbines, 



BOLDEN'S PETS 



73 



ammunition. The rate of ex- 
change was not favorable. Neither 
would the reply be. 

The man set the basket down 
and waited for Bolden to speak. 
“The people have talked?” asked 
Bolden. 

“We have talked to come,” said 
the native, holding out his fingers. 
“In five or seven days, we come.” 

It was a surprise, a pleasant 
one. Did one wicker basket equal 
so many fine products of superla- 
tive technology? Apparently it 
did. The natives had different 
values. To them, one pair of gog- 
gles was worth more than three 
carbines, a package of needles 
easily the equivalent of a box of 
ammunition. 

“It’s good you will come. I will 
leave at once to tell them at the 
settlement,” said Bolden. There 
was something moving in the 
basket, but the weave was close 
and he couldn’t see through it. 

“Stay,” the man advised. “A 
storm blows through the moun- 
tains.” 

“I will fly around the storm,” 
said Bolden. 

If he hadn’t been sick he might 
have accepted the offer. But he 
had to get back to the settlement 
for treatment. On a strange 
planet you never could tell what 
might develop from a seemingly 
minor ailment. Besides he’d al- 
ready been gone two days search- 
ing for this tribe in the inter- 

74 



minable fog that hung over the 
mountains. Those waiting at the 
base would want him back as 
soon as he could get there. 

“Fly far around,” said the man. 
“It is a big storm.” He took up 
the basket and held it level with 
the cabin, opening the top. An 
animal squirmed out and disap- 
peared inside. 

Bolden looked askance at the 
eyes that glowed in the dim in- 
terior. He hadn’t seen clearly 
what the creature was and he 
didn’t like the idea of having it 
loose in the cabin, particularly if 
he had to fly through a storm. 
The man should have left it in 
the basket. But the basket plus 
the animal would have been two 
gifts — and the natives never 
considered anything in even num- 
bers. 

“It will not hurt,” said the man. 
“A gentle pet.” 

A S FAR as he knew, there 
were no pets and very few 
domesticated animals. Bolden 
snapped on the cabin light. It 
was one of those mysterious crea- 
tures every tribe kept in cages 
near the outskirts of their camps. 
What they did with them no one 
knew and the natives either found 
it impossible to explain or did 
not care to do so. 

It seemed unlikely that the 
creatures were used for food and 
certainly they were not work ani- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mals. And in spite of what this 
man said, they were not pets 
either. No Earthman had ever 
seen a native touch them nor had 
the creatures ever been seen 
wandering at large in the camp. 
And until now, none had been 
permitted to pass into Earth’s 
possession. The scientists at the 
settlement would regard this ac- 
quisition with delight. 

“Touch it,” said the native. 

Bolden held out his trembling 
hand and the animal came to him 
with alert and friendly yellow 
eyes. It was about the size of a 
rather small dog, but it didn’t 
look much like one. It resembled 
more closely a tiny slender bear 
with a glossy and shaggy cinna- 
mon coat. Bolden ran his hands 
through the clean-smelling fur 
and the touch warmed his fingers. 
The animal squirmed and licked 
his fingers. 

“It has got your taste,” said 
the native. “Be all right now. It 
is yours.” He turned and walked 
into the mist. 

Bolden got in and started the 
motors while the animal climbed 
into the seat beside him. It was 
a friendly thing and he couldn’t 
understand why the natives al- 
ways kept it caged. 

He headed straight up, looking 
for a way over the mountains to 
avoid the impending storm. Fog 
made it difficult to tell where the 
peaks were and he had to drop 



lower, following meandering val- 
leys. He flew as swiftly as limited 
visibility would allow, but he 
hadn’t gone far when the storm 
broke. He tried to go over the 
top of it, but this storm seemed 
to have no top. The region was 
incompletely mapped and even 
radar wasn’t much help in the 
tremendous electrical display 
that raged around the ship. 

His arms ached as he clung to 
the controls. His hands weren’t 
actually cold, they were numb. 
His legs were leaden. The crea- 
ture crept closer to him and he 
had to nudge it away. Momen- 
tarily the distraction cleared his 
head. He couldn’t put it off any 
longer. He had to land and wait 
out the storm — if he could find 
a place to land. 

Flexing his hands until he 
worked some feeling into them, 
he inched the ship lower. A can- 
yon wall loomed at one side and 
he had to veer away and keep on 
looking. 

Eventually he found his refuge 
— a narrow valley where the 
force of the winds was not ex- 
treme — and he set the land 
anchor. Unless something drastic 
happened, it would hold. 

H E MADE the seat into a bed, 
decided he was too tired to 
eat, and went directly to sleep. 
When he awakened, the storm 
was still raging and the little ani- 



BOLDEN'S PETS 



75 



mal was snoozing by his side. 

He felt well enough to eat. The 
native hadn’t explained what the 
animal should be fed, but it ac- 
cepted everything Bolden offered. 
Apparently it was as omniverous 
as Man. Before lying down again, 
he made the other seat into a bed, 
although it didn’t seem to matter. 
The creature preferred being as 
close to him as it could get and 
he didn’t object. The warmth 
was comforting. 

Alternately dozing and waking 
he waited out the storm. It lasted 
a day and a half. Finally the 
sun was shining. This was two 
days since he had first fallen ill, 
four days after leaving the settle- 
ment. 

Bolden felt much improved. 
His hands were nearly normal 
and his vision wasn’t blurred. He 
looked at the little animal curled 
in his lap, gazing up at him with 
solemn yellow eyes. If he gave it 
encouragement it would probably 
be crawling all over him. How- 
ever, he couldn’t have it frisking 
around while he was flying. 
“Come, Pet,” he said — there 
wasn’t anything else to call it — 
“you’re going places.” 

Picking it up, half-carrying and 
half-dragging it, he took it to the 
rear of the compartment, impro- 
vising a narrow cage back there. 
He was satisfied it would hold. 
He should have done this in the 
beginning. Of course he hadn’t 

76 



felt like it then and he hadn’t 
had the time — and anyway the 
native would have resented such 
treatment of a gift. Probably it 
was best he had waited. 

His pet didn’t like confinement. 
It whined softly for a while. The 
noise stopped when the motors 
roared. Bolden headed straight 
up, until he was high enough to 
establish communication over the 
peaks. He made a brief report 
about the natives’ agreement and 
his own illness, then he started 
home. 

He flew at top speed for ten 
hours. He satisfied his hunger by 
nibbling concentrated rations 
from time to time. The animal 
whined occasionally, but Bolden 
had learned to identify the 
sounds it made. It was neither 
hungry nor thirsty. If merely 
wanted to be near him. And all 
he wanted was to reach the base. 

The raw sprawling settlement 
looked good as he sat the copter 
down. Mechanics came running 
from the hangars. They opened 
the door and he stepped out. 

And fell on his face. There was 
no feeling in his hands and none 
in his legs. He hadn’t recovered. 

T'|OCTOR Kessler peered at 
him through the microscreen. 
It gave his face a narrow insub- 
stantial appearance. The micro- 
screen was a hemispherical force 
field enclosing his head. It origi- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nated in a tubular circlet that 
snapped around his throat at the 
top of the decontagion suit. The 
field killed all microlife that 
passed through it or came in con- 
tact with it. The decontagion suit 
was non-porous and imperme- 
able, covering completely the rest 
of his body. The material was 
thinner over his hands and thick- 
er at the soles. 

Bolden took in the details at 
a glance. “Is it serious?” he asked, 
his voice cracking with the effort. 

“Merely a precaution,” said the 
doctor hollowly. The microscreen 
distorted sound as well as sight. 
“Merely a precaution. We know 
what it is, but we’re not sure of 
the best way to treat it.” 

Bolden grunted to himself. The 
microscreen and decontagion suit 
were strong precautions. 

The doctor wheeled a small 
machine from the wall and placed 
Bolden’s hand in a narrow trough 
that held it steady. The eyepiece 
slid into the microscreen and, 
starting at the finger tips, Kessler 
examined the arm, traveling slow- 
ly upward. At last he stopped. 
“Is this where feeling ends?” 

“I think so. Touch it. Yeah. 
It’s dead below there.” 

“Good. Then we’ve got it 
pegged. It’s the Bubble Death.” 
Bolden showed concern and 
the doctor laughed. “Don’t worry. 
It’s called that because of the 
way it looks through the X-ray 



microscope. It’s true that it killed 
the scouting expedition that dis- 
covered the planet, but it won’t 
get you.” 

“They had antibiotics. Neobi- 
otics, too.” 

“Sure. But they had only a few 
standard kinds. Their knowledge 
was more limited and they 
lacked the equipment we now 
have.” 

The doctor made it sound com- 
forting. But Bolden wasn’t com- 
forted. Not just yet. 

“Sit up and take a look,” said 
Kessler, bending the eyepiece 
around so Bolden could use it. 
“The dark filamented lines are 
nerves. See what surrounds 
them?” 

Bolden watched as the doctor 
adjusted the focus for him. Each 
filament was covered with count- 
less tiny spheres that isolated and 
insulated the nerve from contact. 
That’s why he couldn’t feel any- 
thing. The spherical microbes did 
look like bubbles. As yet they 
didn’t seem to have attacked the 
nerves directly. 

While he watched, the doctor 
swiveled out another eyepiece for 
his own use and turned a knob 
on the side of the machine. From 
the lens next to his arm an almost 
invisible needle slid out and en- 
tered his flesh. Bolden could see 
it come into the field of view. It 
didn’t hurt. Slowly it approached 
the dark branching filament, 



BOLDEN'S PETS 



77 



never quite touching it. 

The needle was hollow and as 
Kessler squeezed the knob it 
sucked in the spheres. The needle 
extended a snout which crept 
along the nerve, vacuuming in 
microbes as it moved. When a 
section had been cleansed, the 
snout was retracted. Bolden could 
feel the needle then. 

W HEN the doctor finished, he 
laid Bolden’s hand back at 
his side and wheeled the machine 
to the wall, extracting a small 
capsule which he dropped into a 
slot that led to the outside. He 
came back and sat down. 

“Is that what you’re going to 
do?” asked Bolden. “Scrape them 
off?” 

“Hardly. There are too many 
nerves. If we had ten machines 
and enough people to operate 
them, we might check the advance 
in one arm. That’s all.” The doc- 
tor leaned back in the chair. “No. 
I was collecting a few more sam- 
ples. We’re trying to find out 
what the microbes react to.” 
“More samples? Then you 
must have taken others.” 

“Certainly. We put you out 
for a while to let you rest.” The 
chair came down on four legs. 
“You’ve got a mild case. Either 
that or you have a strong natural 
immunity. It’s now been three 
days since you reported the first 
symptoms and it isn’t very ad- 



vanced. It killed the entire scout- 
ing expedition in less time than 
that.” 

Bolden looked at the ceiling. 
Eventually they’d find a cure. 
But would he be alive that long? 

“I suspect what you’re think- 
ing,” said the doctor. “Don’t over- 
look our special equipment. We 
already have specimens in the 
sonic accelerator. We’ve been 
able to speed up the life processes 
of the microbes about ten times. 
Before the day is over we’ll know 
which of our anti and neobiotics 
they like the least. Tough little 
things so far — unbelievably 
tough — but you can be sure 
we’ll smack them.” 

His mind was active, but out- 
wardly Bolden was quiescent as 
the doctor continued his explana- 
tion. 

The disease attacked the 
superficial nervous system, be- 
ginning with the extremities. The 
bodies of the crew of the scouting 
expedition had been in an ad- 
vanced state of decomposition 
when the medical rescue team 
reached them and the microbes 
were no longer active. Neverthe- 
less it was a reasonable supposi- 
tion that death had come shortly 
after the invading bacteria had 
reached the brain. Until then, 
though nerves were the route 
along which the microbes trav- 
eled, no irreparable damage had 
been done. 



BOLDEN'S PETS 



79 



rpHIS MUCH was good news. 

Either he would recover com- 
pletely or he would die. He would 
not be crippled permanently. An- 
other factor in his favor was the 
sonic accelerator. By finding the 
natural resonance of the one- 
celled creature and gradually in- 
creasing the tempo of the sound 
field, the doctor could grow and 
test ten generations in the labora- 
tory while one generation was 
breeding in the body. Bolden was 
the first patient actually being 
observed with the disease, but 
the time element wasn’t as bad 
as he had thought. 

“That’s where you are,” con- 
cluded Kessler. “Now, among 
other things, we’ve got to find 
where you’ve been.” 

“The ship has an automatic 
log,” said Bolden. “It indicates 
every place I landed.” 

“True, but our grid coordin- 
ates are not exact. It will be a 
few years before we’re able to 
look at a log and locate within 
ten feet of where a ship has been.” 
The doctor spread out a large 
photomap. There were several 
marks on it. He fastened a stere- 
scope viewer over Bolden’s eyes 
and handed him a pencil. “Can 
you use this?” 

“I think so.” His fingers were 
stiff and he couldn’t feel, but he 
could mark with the pencil. Kess- 
ler moved the map nearer and 
the terrain sprang up in detail. 

80 



In some cases, he could see it 
more clearly than when he had 
been there, because on the map 
there was no fog. Bolden made 
a few corrections and the doctor 
took the map away and removed 
the viewer. 

“We’ll have to stay away from 
these places until we get a cure. 
Did you notice anything peculiar 
in any of the places you went?” 

“It was all mountainous coun- 
try.” 

“Which probably means that 
we’re safe on the plain. Were 
there any animals?” 

“Nothing that came close. 
Birds maybe.” 

“More likely it was an insect. 
Well, we’ll worry about the host 
and how it is transmitted. Try 
not to be upset. You’re as safe 
as you would be on Earth.” 

“Yeah,” said Bolden. “Where’s 
the pet?” 

The doctor laughed. “You did 
very well on that one. The biolo- 
gists have been curious about the 
animal since the day they saw 
one in a native camp.” 

“They can look at it as much 
as they want,” said Bolden. 
“Nothing more on this one, 
though. It’s a personal gift.” 

“You’re sure it’s personal?” 

“The native said it was.” 

The doctor sighed. “I’ll tell 
them. They won’t like it, but we 
can’t argue with the natives if 
we want their cooperation.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION f 



Bolden smiled. The animal was 
safe for at least six months. He 
could understand the biologists’ 
curiosity, but there was enough 
to keep them curious for a long 
time on a new planet. And it 
was his. In a remarkably short 
time, he had become attached to 
it. It was one of those rare things 
that Man happened across occa- 
sionally — about once in every 
five planets. Useless, completely 
useless, the creature had one vir- 
tue. It liked Man and Man liked 
it. It was a pet. “Okay,” he said. 
“But you didn’t tell me where 
it is.” 

The doctor shrugged, but the 
gesture was lost in the shapeless 
decontagion suit. “Do you think 
we’re letting it run in the streets? 
It’s in the next room, under ob- 
servation.” 

The doctor was more con- 
cerned than he was letting on. 
The hospital was small and ani- 
mals were never kept in it. “It’s 
not the carrier. I was sick before 
it was given to me.” 

“You had something, we know 
that much, but was it this? Even 
granting that you’re right, it was 
in contact with you and may 
now be infected.” 

“I think life on this planet 
isn’t bothered by the disease. The 
natives have been every place I 
went and none of them seemed 
to have it.” 

“Didn’t they?” said the doctor, 



going to the door. “Maybe. It’s 
too early to say.” He reeled a 
cord out of the wall and plugged 
it into the decontagion suit. He 
spread his legs and held his arms 
away from his sides. In an instant, 
the suit glowed white hot. Only 
for an instant, and it was insu- 
lated inside. Even so it must be 
uncomfortable — and the pro- 
cess would be repeated outside. 
The doctor wasn’t taking any 
chances. “Try to sleep,” he said. 
“Ring if there’s a change in your 
condition — even if you think 
it’s insignificant.” 

“I’ll ring,” said Bolden. In a 
short time he fell asleep. It was 
easy to sleep. 

f I^HE NURSE entered as quiet- 
ly as she could in the decon- 
tagion outfit. It awakened Bolden. 
It was evening. He had slept most 
of the day, “Which one are you?” 
he asked. “The pretty one?” 

“All nurses are pretty if you 
get well. Here. Swallow this.” 

It was Peggy. He looked doubt- 
fully at what she held out. “All 
of it?” 

“Certainly. You get it down 
and I’ll see that it comes back 
up. The string won’t hurt you.” 
She passed a small instrument 
over his body, reading the dial 
she held in the other hand. The 
information, he knew, was being 
recorded elsewhere on a master 
chart. Apparently the instrument 



BOLDEN'S PETS 



81 



measured neural currents and 
hence indirectly the progress of 
the disease. Already they had 
evolved new diagnostic tech- 
niques. He wished they’d made 
the same advance in treatment. 

After expertly reeling out the 
instrument he had swallowed, the 
nurse read it and deposited it in 
a receptacle in the wall. She 
brought a tray and told him to 
eat. He wanted to question her, 
but she was insistent about it so 
he ate. Allowance had been made 
for his partial paralysis. The food 
was liquid. It was probably nutri- 
tious, but he didn’t care for the 
taste. 

She took the tray away and 
came back and sat beside him. 
“Now we can talk,” she said. 

“What’s going on?” he said 
bluntly. “When do I start getting 
shots? Nothing’s been done for 
me so far.” 

“I don’t know what the doc- 
tor’s working out for you. I’m 
just the nurse.” 

“Don’t try to tell me that,” he 
said. “You’re a doctor yourself. 
In a pinch you could take Kess- 
ler’s place.” » 

“And I get my share of 
pinches,” she said brightly. “Okay, 
so I’m a doctor, but only on 
Earth. Until I complete my off- 
planet internship here, I’m not 
allowed to practice.” 

“You know as much about Van 
Daamas as anyone does.” 

82 



“That may be,” she said. “Now 
don’t be alarmed, but the truth 
ought to be obvious. None of our 
anti or neobiotics or combina- 
tions of them have a positive 
effect. We’re looking for some- 
thing new.” 

It should have been obvious; 
he had, been hoping against that, 
though. He looked at the shape- 
less figure sitting beside him and 
remembered Peggy as she usually 
looked. He wondered if they were 
any longer concerned with him 
as an individual. They must be 
working mainly to keep the di- 
sease from spreading. “What are 
my chances?” 

“Better than you think. We’re 
looking for an additive that will 
make the biotics effective.” 

ITE HADN’T thought of that, 
though it was often used, par- 
ticularly on newly settled planets. 
He had heard of a virus infection 
common to Centaurus that could 
be completely controlled by a 
shot of neobiotics plus aspirin, 
though separately neither was of 
any value. But the discovery of 
what substance should be added 
to what antibiotic was largely 
one of trial and error. That took 
time and there wasn’t much time. 
“What else?” he said. 

“That’s about it. We’re not try- 
ing to make you believe this 
isn’t serious. But don’t forget 
we’re working ten times as fast 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



as the disease can multiply. We 
expect a break any moment.” She 
got up. “Want a sedative for the 
night?” 

“I’ve got a sedative inside me. 
Looks like it will be permanent.” 

“That’s what I like about you, 
you’re so cheerful,” she said, lean- 
ing over and clipping something 
around his throat. “In case you’re 
wondering, we’re going to be busy 
tonight checking the microbe. We 
can put someone in with you, but 
we thought you’d rather have all 
of us working on it.” 

“Sure,” he said. 

“This is a body monitor. If you 
want anything just call and we’ll 
be here within minutes.” 

“Thanks,” he said. “I won’t 
panic tonight.” 

She plugged in the decontagion 
uniform, flashed it on and then 
left the room. After she was gone, 
the body monitor no longer 
seemed reassuring. It was going 
to take something positive to pull 
him through. 

They were going to work 
through the night, but did they 
actually hope for success. What 
had Peggy said? None of the anti 
or neobiotics had a positive reac- 
tion. Unknowingly she had let it 
slip. The reaction was negative; 
the bubble microbes actually 
grew faster in the medium that 
was supposed to stop them. It 
happened occasionally on strange 
planets. It was his bad luck that 



it was happening to him. 

He pushed the thoughts out of 
his mind and tried to sleep. He 
did for a time. When he awak- 
ened he thought, at first, it was 
his arms that had aroused him. 
They seemed to be on fire, deep 
inside. To a limited extent, he 
still had control. He could move 
them though there was no sur- 
face sensation. Interior nerves 
had not been greatly affected un- 
til now. But outside the infection 
had crept up. It was no longer 
just above the wrists. It had 
reached his elbows and passed 
beyond. A few inches below his 
shoulder he could feel nothing. 
The illness was accelerating. If 
they had ever thought of ampu- 
tation, it was too late, now. 

TTE RESISTED an impulse to 
cry out. A nurse would come 
and sit beside him, but he would 
be taking her from work that 
might save his life. The infection 
would reach his shoulders and 
move across his chest and back. 
It would travel up his throat and 
he wouldn’t be able to move his 
lips. It would paralyze his eye- 
lids so that he couldn’t blink. 
Maybe it would blind him, too. 
And then it would find ingress 
to his brain. 

The result would be a meta- 
bolic explosion. Swiftly each 
bodily function would stop alto- 
gether or race wildly as the cen-

tral nervous system was invaded, 
one regulatory center after the 
other blanking out. His body 
would be aflame or it would 
smolder and flicker out. Death 
might be spectacular or it could 
come very quietly. 

That was one reason he didn’t 
call the nurse. 

The other was the noise. 

It was a low sound, half purr, 
half a coaxing growl. It was the 
animal the native had given him, 
confined in the next room. 
Bolden was not sure why he did 
what he did next. Instinct or 
reason may have governed his 
actions. But instinct and reason 
are divisive concepts that cannot 
apply to the human mind, which 
is actually indivisible. 

He got out of bed. Unable to 
stand, he rolled to the floor. He 
couldn’t crawl very well because 
his hands wouldn’t support his 
weight so he crept along on his 
knees and elbows. It didn’t hurt. 
Nothing hurt except the fire in 
his bones. He reached the door 
and straightened up on his knees. 
He raised his hand to the handle, 
but couldn’t grasp it. After sev- 
eral trials, he abandoned the 
attempt and hooked his chin on 
the handles, pulling it down. The 
door opened and he was in the 
next room. The animal was whin- 
ing louder now that he was near. 
Yellow eyes glowed at him from 
the corner. He crept to the cage. 

84 



It was latched. The animal 
shivered eagerly, pressing against 
the side, striving to reach him. 
His hands were numb and he 
couldn’t work the latch. The ani- 
mal licked his fingers. 

It was easier after that. He 
couldn’t feel what he was doing, 
but somehow he managed to un- 
latch it. The door swung open 
and the animal bounded out, 
knocking him to the floor. 

He didn’t mind at all because 
now he was sure he was right. 
The natives had given him the 
animal for a purpose. Their own 
existence was meager, near the 
edge of extinction. They could 
not afford to keep something that 
wasn’t useful. And this creature 
was useful. Tiny blue sparks 
crackled from the fur as it rubbed 
against him in the darkness. It 
was not whining. It rumbled and 
purred as it licked his hands and 
arms and rolled against his legs. 

After a while he was strong 
enough to crawl back to bed, 
leaning against the animal for 
support. He lifted himself up and 
fell across the bed in exhaustion. 
Blood didn’t circulate well in his 
crippled body. The animal 
bounded up and tried to melt 
itself into his body. He couldn’t 
push it away if he wanted. He 
didn’t want to. He stirred and 
got himself into a more comfort- 
able position. He wasn’t going to 
die. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I N THE morning, Bolden was 
awake long before the doctor 
came in. Kessler’s face was hag- 
gard and the smile was something 
he assumed solely for the pa- 
tient’s benefit. If he could have 
seen what 'the expression looked 
like after filtering through the 
microscreen, he would have aban- 
doned it. “I see you’re holding 
your own,” he said with hollow 
cheerfulness. “We’re doing quite 
well ourselves.” 

“I’ll bet,” said Bolden. “Maybe 
you’ve got to the point where one 
of the antibiotics doesn’t actually 
stimulate the growth of the mi- 
crobes?” 

“I was afraid you’d find it out,” 
sighed the doctor. “We can’t keep 
everything from you.” 

“You could have given me a 
shot of plasma and said it was 
a powerful new drug.” 

“That idea went out of medical 
treatment a couple of hundred 
years ago,” said the doctor. 
“You’d feel worse when you 
failed to show improvement. Set- 
tling a planet isn’t easy and the 
dangers aren’t imaginary. You’ve 
got to be able to face facts as 
they come.” 

He peered uncertainly at 
Bolden. The microscreen dis- 
torted his vision, too. “We’re mak- 
ing progress though it may not 
seem so to you. When a mixture 
of a calcium salt plus two anti- 
histamines is added to a certain 



neobiotic, the result is that the 
microbe grows no faster than it 
should. Switching the ingredients 
here and there — maybe it ought 
to be a potassium salt — and the 
first thing you know we’ll have 
it stopped cold.” 

“I doubt the effectiveness of 
those results,” said Bolden. “In 
fact, I think you’re on the wrong 
track. Try investigating the ef- 
fects of neural induction.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
said the doctor, coming closer 
and glancing suspiciously at the 
lump beside Bolden. “Do you 
feel dizzy? Is there anything else 
unusual that you notice?” 

“Don’t shout at the patient.” 
Bolden waggled his finger reprov- 
ingly. He was proud of the finger. 
He couldn’t feel what he was 
doing, but he had control over it. 
“You, Kessler, should face the 
fact that a doctor can learn from 
a patient what the patient learned 
from the natives.” 

But Kessler didn’t hear what 
he said. He was looking at the 
upraised hand. “You’re moving 
almost normally,” he said. “Your 
own immunity factor is control- 
ling the disease.” 

“Sure. I’ve got an immunity 
factor,” said Bolden. “The same 
one the natives have. Only it’s 
not inside my body.” He rested 
his hand on the animal beneath 
the covers. It never wanted to 
leave him. It wouldn’t have to. 



BOLDEN'S PETS 



85 



“I can set your mind at rest on 
one thing, Doctor. Natives are 
susceptible to the disease, too. 
That’s why they were able to 
recognize I had it. They gave me 
the cure and told me what it was, 
but I was unable to see it until 
it was nearly too late. Here it is.” 
He turned back the covers and 
the exposed animal sleeping 
peacefully on his legs which 
raised its head and licked his 
fingers. He felt that. 

A FTER AN explanation the 
doctor tempered his disap- 
proval. It was an unsanitary prac- 
tice, but he had to admit that 
the patient was much improved. 
Kessler verified the state of 
Bolden’s health by extensive use 
of the X-ray microscope. Reluct- 
antly he wheeled the machine to 
the wall and covered it up. 

“The infection is definitely re- 
ceding,” he said. “There are previ- 
ously infected areas in which I 
find it difficult to locate a single 
microbe. What I can’t understand 
is how it’s done. According to 
you, the animal doesn’t break the 
skin with its tongue and there- 
fore nothing is released into the 
bloodstream. All that seems 
necessary is that the animal be 
near you.” He shook his head 
behind the microscreen. “I don’t 
think much of the electrical 
analogy you used.” 

“I said the first thing I thought 



of. I don’t know if that’s the way 
it works, but it seems to me like 
a pretty fair guess.” 

“The microbes do cluster 
around nerves,” said the doctor. 
“We know that neural activity is 
partly electrical. If the level of 
that activity can be increased, the 
bacteria might be killed by ionic 
dissociation.” He glanced specu- 
latively at Bolden and the ani- 
mal. “Perhaps you do borrow 
nervous energy from the animal. 
We might also find it possible to 
control the disease with an elec- 
trical current.” 

“Don’t try to find out on me,” 
said Bolden. “I’ve been an ex- 
perimental specimen long enough. 
Take somebody who’s healthy. 
I’ll stick with the natives’ 
method.” 

“I wasn’t thinking of experi- 
ments in your condition. You’re 
still not out of danger.” Never- 
theless he showed his real opinion 
when he left the room. He failed 
to plug in and flash the deconta- 
gion suit. 

Bolden smiled at the doctor’s 
omission and ran his hand 
through the fur. He was going to 
get well. 

T>UT HIS progress was some- 
what slower than he’d antici- 
pated though it seemed to satisfy 
the doctor who went on with his 
experiments. The offending bac- 
teria could be killed electrically. 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But the current was dangerously 
large and there was no practical 
way to apply the treatment to 
humans. The animal was the only 
effective method. 

Kessler discovered the microbe 
required an intermediate host. A 
tick or a mosquito seemed indi- 
cated. It would take a protracted 
search of the mountains to de- 
termine just what insect was the 
carrier. In any event the elabor- 
ate sanitary precautions were 
unnecessary. Microscreens came 
down and decontagion suits were 
no longer worn. Bolden could not 
pass the disease on to anyone 
else. 

Neither could the animal. It 
seemed wholely without para- 
'sites. It was clean and affection- 
ate, warm to the touch. Bolden 
was fortunate that there was such 
a simple cure for the most dread- 
ed disease on Van Daamas. 

It was several days before he 
was ready to leave the small 
hospital at the edge of the settle- 
ment. At first he sat up in bed 
and then he was allowed to walk 
across the room. As his activity 
increased, the animal became 
more and more content to lie on 
the bed and follow him with its 
eyes. It no longer frisked about 
as it had in the beginning. As 
Bolden told the nurse, it was be- 
coming housebroken. 

The time came when the doc- 
tor failed to find a single microbe. 



Bolden’s newly returned strength 
and the sensitivity of his skin 
where before there had been 
numbness confirmed the diag- 
nosis. He was well. Peggy came 
to walk him home. It was pleas- 
ant to have her near. 

“I see you’re ready,” she said, 
laughing at his eagerness. 

“Except for one thing,” he 
said. “Come, Pet.” The animal 
raised its head from the bed 
where it slept. 

“Pet?” she said quizzically. 
“You ought to give it a name. 
You’ve had it long enough to 
decide on something.” 

“Pet’s a name,” he said. “What 
can I call it? Doc? Hero?” 

She made a face. “I can’t say 
I care for either choice, although 
it did save your life.” 

“Yes, but that’s an attribute it 
can’t help. The important thing 
is that if you listed what you 
expect of a pet you’d find it in 
this creature. Docile, gentle, live- 
ly at times; all it wants is to be 
near you, to have you touch it. 
And it’s very clean.” 

“All right, call it Pet if you 
want,” said Peggy. “Come on, 
Pet.” 

It paid no attention to her. It 
came when Bolden called, getting 
slowly off the bed. It stayed as 
close as it could get to Bolden. 
He was still weak so they didn’t 
walk fast and, at first, the animal 
was able to keep up. 



BOLDEN'S PETS 



87 



T T WAS almost noon when they 

went out. The sun was bril- 
liant and Van Daamas seemed 
wonderful place to be alive in. 
Yes, with death behind him, it 
was a very wonderful place. 
Bolden chatted gaily with Peggy. 
She was fine company. 

And then Bolden saw the na- 
tive who had given him the ani- 
mal. Five to seven days, and he 
had arrived on time. The rest of 
the tribe must be elsewhere in 
the settlement. Bolden smiled in 
recognition while the man was 
still at some distance. For an an- 
swer the native shifted the bow 
in his hand and glanced behind 
the couple, in the direction of 
the hospital. 

The movement with the bow 
might have been menacing, but 
Bolden ignored that gesture. It 
was the sense that something was 
missing that caused him to look 
down. The animal was not at his 
side. He turned around. 

The creature was struggling in 
the dust. It got to its feet and 
wobbled toward him, staggering 
crazily as it tried to reach him. 
It spun around, saw him, and 
came on again. The tongue lolled 
out and it whined once. Then the 
native shot it through the heart, 
pinning it to the ground. The 
short tail thumped and then it 
died. 

Bolden couldn’t move. Peggy 
clutched his arm. The native 

88 



walked over to the animal and 
looked down. He was silent for 
• moment. “Die anyway soon,” 
ne said to Bolden. “Burned out 
inside.” 

He bent over. The bright 
yellow eyes had faded to nothing- 
ness in the sunlight. “Gave you 
its health,” said the man of Van 
Daamas respectfully as he broke 
off the protruding arrow. 

It was a dark blue arrow. 

1VT OW EVERY settlement on 
^ the planet has Bolden’s pets. 
They have been given a more 
scientific name, but nobody re- 
members what it is. The animals 
are kept in pens, exactly as is 
done by the natives, on one side 
of town, not too near any habita- 
tion. 

For a while, there was talk 
that it was unscientific to use the 
animal. It was thought that an 
electrical treatment could be de- 
veloped to replace it. Perhaps 
this was true. But settling a 
planet is a big task. As long as 
one method works there isn’t 
time for research. And it works 
— the percentage of recovery is 
as high as in other common ail- 
ments. 

But in any case the animal 
can never become a pet, though 
it may be in the small but bright 
spark of consciousness that is all 
the little yellow-eyed creature 
wants. The quality that makes it 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



so valuable is the final disquali- 
fication. Strength can be a weak- 
ness. Its nervous system is too 
powerful for a man in good 
health, upsetting the delicate bal- 
ance of the human body in a 
variety of unusual ways. How 
the energy-transfer takes place 
has never been determined exact- 
ly, but it does occur. 

It is only when he is stricken 
with the Bubble Death and needs 
additional energy to drive the 
invading microbes from the tissue 
around his nerves that the patient 
is allowed to have one of Bolden’s 
pets. 

In the end, it is the animal 
that dies. As the natives knew, 



it is kindness to kill it quickly. 

It is highly regarded and re- 
spectfully spoken of. Children 
play as close as they can get, but 
are kept well away from the pens 
by a high, sturdy fence. Adults 
walk by and nod kindly to it. 

Bolden never goes there nor 
will he speak of it. His friends say 
he’s unhappy about being the 
first Earthman to discover the 
usefulness of the little animal. 
They are right. It is a distinction 
he doesn’t care for. He still has 
the blue arrow. There are local 
craftsmen who can mend it, but 
he has refused their services. He 
wants to keep it as it is.

Jack of No Trades 



By EVELYN E. SMITH 



I was psick of Psi powers, not 
having any. Or didn't I? Maybe 
they'd psee otherwise psomeday! 



I WALKED into the dining 
room and collided with a 
floating mass of fabric, which 
promptly draped itself over me 
like a sentient shroud. 

“Oh, for God’s sake, Kevin!” 
my middle brother’s voice came 
muffled through the folds. “If 
you can’t help, at least don’t 
hinder!” 

I managed to struggle out of 
the tablecloth, even though it 
seemed to be trying to wrap it- 
self around me. When Danny got 
excited, he lost his mental grip. 

“I could help,” I yelled as soon 
as I got my head free, “if any- 
body would let me and, what’s

more, I could set the table a 
damn sight faster by hand than 
you do with ’kinesis.” 

Just then Father appeared at 
the head of the table. He could 
as easily have walked downstairs 
as teleported, but I belonged to 
a family of exhibitionists. And 
Father tended to show off as if 
he were still a kid. Not that he 
looked his age — he was big and 
blond, like Danny and Tim and 
me, and could have passed for 
our older brother. 

“Boys, boys!” he reproved us. 
“Danny, you ought to be ashamed 
of yourself — picking on poor 
Kev.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Even if it hadn’t been Danny’s 
fault, he would still nave been 
blamed. 

Nobody was ever supposed to 
raise a voice or a hand or a 
thought to poor afflicted Kev, be- 
cause nature had picked on me 
enough. And the nicer everybody 
was to me, the nastier I became, 
since only when they lost their 
tempers could I get — or so I 
believed — their true attitude 
toward me. 

How else could I tell? 

“Sorry, fella,” Dan apologized 
to me. The tablecloth spread it- 
self out on the table. “Wrinkles,” 
he grumbled to himself. “Wrin- 
kles. And I had it so nice and 
smooth before. Mother will be 
furious.” 

“If she were going to be furi- 
ous, she’d be furious already,” 
Father reminded him sadly. It 
must be tough to be married to 
a deep-probe telepath, I thought, 
and I felt a sudden wave of sym- 
pathy for him. It was so seldom 
I got the chance to feel sorry for 
anyone except myself. “But I 
think you’ll find she understands.” 

“She knows, all right,” Danny 
remarked as he went on into the 
kitchen,' “but I’m not sure she 
always understands.” 

I was surprised to find him so 
perceptive on the abstract level, 
because he wasn’t what you might 
call an understanding person, 
either. 



1 1 HERE are tensions in this 
room,” my sister an- 
nounced as she slouched in, not 
quite awake yet, “and hatred. I 
could feel them all the way up- 
stairs. And today I’m working on 
the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so 
I must feel absolutely tranquil. 
Everyone will think beautiful 
thoughts, please.” 

She sat down just as a glass of 
orange juice was arriving at her 
place; Danny apparently didn’t 
know she’d come in already. The 
glass bumped into the back of 
her neck, tilted and poured its 
contents over her shoulder and 
down her very considerable de- 
colletage. Being a mere primitive, 
I couldn’t help laughing. 

“Danny, you fumbler!” she 
screamed. 

Danny erupted from the kit- 
chen. “How many times have I 
asked all of you not to sit down 
until I’ve got everything on the 
table? Always a lot of interfering 
busybodies getting in the way.” 
“I don’t see why you have to 
set the table at all,” she retorted. 
“A robot could do it better and 
faster than you. Even Kev could.” 
She turned quickly toward me. 
“Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.” 

I didn’t say anything; I was too 
busy pressing my hands down on 
the back of the chair to make my 
knuckles turn white. 

Sylvia’s face turned even whit- 
er. “Father, stop him — stop him! 



JACK OF NO TRADES 



91 



He’s hating again! I can’t stand 
it!” 

Father looked at me, then at 
her. “I don’t think he can help it, 
Sylvia.” 

I grinned. “That’s right — I’m 
just a poor atavism with no con- 
trol over myself a-tall.” 

Finally my mother came in 
from the kitchen; she was an old- 
fashioned woman and didn’t hold 
with robocooks. One quick glance 
at me gave her the complete de- 
tails, even though I quickly pro- 
tested, “It’s illegal to probe any- 
one without permission.” 

“I used to probe you to find 
out when you needed your dia- 
pers changed,” she said tartly, 
“and I’ll probe you now. You 
should watch yourself, Sylvia — 
poor Kevin isn’t responsible.” 

She didn’t need to probe to 
get the blast of naked emotion 
that spurted out from me. My 
sister screamed and even Father 
looked uncomfortable. Danny 
stomped back into the kitchen, 
muttering to himself. 

Mother’s lips tightened. “Syl- 
via, go upstairs and change your 
dress. Kevin, do I have to make 
an appointment for you at the 
clinic again?” A psychiatrist never 
diagnosed members of his own 
family — that is, not officially; 
they couldn’t help offering thumb- 
nail diagnoses any more than 
they could help having thumb- 
nails.

“No use,” I said, deciding it 
was safe to drop into my chair. 
“Who can adjust me to an envi- 
ronment to which I’m funda- 
mentally unsuited?” 

“Maybe there is something 
physically wrong with him, Amy,” 
my father suggested hopefully. 
“Maybe you should make an ap- 
pointment for him at the cure- 
all?” 

Mother shook her neatly 
coiffed head. “He’s been to it 
dozens of times and he always 
checks out in splendid shape. 
None of us can spare the time to 
go with him again, just on an off- 
chance, and he could hardly be 
allowed to make such a long trip 
all by himself. Pity there isn’t a 
machine in every community, 
but, then, we don’t really need 
them.” 

TVTOW THAT the virus diseases 

’ had been licked, people 
hardly ever got sick any more 
and, when they did, it was mostly 
psychosomatic. Life was so well 
organized that there weren’t even 
many accidents these days. It was 
a safe, orderly existence for those 
who fitted into it — which ac- 
counted for more than ninety- 
five per cent of the population. 
The only ones who didn’t adjust 
were those who couldn’t, like me 
— psi-deficients, throwbacks to 
an earlier era. There were no 
physical cripples, because any- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



body could have a new arm or 
a new leg grafted on, but you 
couldn’t graft psi powers onto an 
atavism or, if you could, the tech- 
nique hadn’t been developed yet. 

“I feel a sense of impending 
doom brooding over this house- 
hold,” my youngest brother re- 
marked cheerfully as he vaulted 
into his chair. 

“You always do, Timothy,” my 
mother said, unfolding her nap- 
kin. “And I must say it’s not in 
good taste, especially at break- 
fast.” 

He reached for his juice. 
“Guess this is a doomed house- 
hold. And what was all that emo- 
tional uproar about?” 

“The usual,” Sylvia said from 
the doorway before anyone else 
could answer. She slid warily in- 
to her chair. “Hey, Dan, I’m 
here!” she called. “If anything 
else comes in, it comes in manu- 
ally, understand?” 

“Oh, all right.” Dan emerged 
from the kitchen with a tray of 
food floating ahead of him. 

“The usual? Trouble with 
Kev?” Tim looked at me nar- 
rowly. “Somehow my sense of 
ominousness is connected with 
him.” 

“Well, that’s perfectly natural 
— ” Sylvia began, then stopped 
as Mother caught her eye. 

“I didn’t mean that,” Tim 
said. “I still say Kev’s got some- 
thing we can’t figure out.” 



“You’ve been saying that for 
years,” Danny protested, “and 
he’s been tested for every faculty 
under the Sun. He can’t telepath 
or teleport or telekinesthesize or 
even teletype. He can’t precog- 
nize or prefix or prepossess. He 
can’t — ” 

“Strictly a bundle of no-talent, 
that’s me,” I interrupted, trying 
to keep my animal feelings from 
getting the better of me. That 
was how my family thought of 
me, I knew — as an animal, and 
not a very lovable one, either. 

“No,” Tim said, “he’s just got 
something we haven’t developed 
a test for. It’ll come out some 
day, you’ll see.” He smiled at me. 

1 SMILED at him gratefully; 

he was the only member of 
my family who really seemed to 
like me in spite of my handicap. 
“It won’t work, Tim. I know 
you’re trying to be kind, but — ” 
“He’s not saying it just to be 
kind,” my mother put in. “He 
means it. Not that I want to 
arouse false hopes, Kevin,” she 
added with grim scrupulousness. 
“Tim’s awfully young yet and I 
wouldn’t trust his extracurricular 
prognostications too far.” 

Nonetheless, I couldn’t help 
feeling a feeble renewal of old 
hopes. After all, young or not, 
Tim was a hell of a good prog- 
nosticator; he wouldn’t have risen 
so rapidly to the position he held

in the Weather Bureau if he 
hadn’t been pretty near tops in 
foreboding. 

Mother smiled sadly at my 
thoughts, but I didn’t let that 
discourage me. As Danny had 
said, she knew but she didn’t 
really understand. Nobody, for 
all of his or her psi power, really 
understood me. 

B REAKFAST was finally over 
and the rest of my family 
dispersed to their various jobs. 
Father simply took his briefcase 
and disappeared — he was a 
traveling salesman and he had a 
morning appointment clear across 
the continent. The others, not 
having his particular gift, had to 
take the helibus to their different 
destinations. Mother, as I said, 
was a psychiatrist. Sylvia wrote 
advertising copy. Tim was a 
meteorologist. Dan was a junior 
executive in a furniture moving 
company and expected a promo- 
tion to senior rank as soon as he 
achieved a better mental grip on 
pianos. 

Only I had no job, no profes- 
sion, no place in life. Of course 
there were certain menial tasks 
a psi-negative could perform, but 
my parents would have none of 
them — partly for my sake, but 
mostly for the sake of their own 
community standing. 

“We don’t need what little 
money Kev could bring in,” my 



father always said. “I can afford 
to support my family. He can 
stay home and take care of the 
house.” 

And that’s what I did. Not that 
there was much to do except call 
a techno whenever one of the 
servomechanisms missed a beat. 
True enough, those things had to 
be watched mighty carefully be- 
cause, if they broke down, it 
sometimes took days before the 
repair and/or replacement robots 
could come. There never were 
enough of them because ours was 
a constructive society. Still, being 
a machine-sitter isn’t very much 
of a career. And every function 
that wasn’t the prerogative of a 
machine could be done ten times 
more quickly and efficiently by 
some member of my family than 
I could do it. If I went ahead 
and did something anyway, they 
would just do it all over again 
when they got home. 

So I had nothing to do all day. 
I had a special dispensation to 
take books out of the local 
Archives, because I was a defi- 
cient and couldn’t receive the 
tellie programs. Almost every- 
body on Earth was telepathic to 
some degree and could get the 
amplified projections even if he 
couldn’t transmit or receive with 
his natural powers. But I got 
nothing. I had to derive all my 
recreation from reading, and you 
can get awfully tired of books, 



JACK OF NO TRADES

especially when they’re all at 
least a hundred years old and 
written by primitives. I could 
borrow sound tapes, but they also 
bored me after a while. 

I thought maybe I could de- 
velop a talent for composing or 
painting, which would classify me 
as a telesensitive — artistic abil- 
ity being considered as the oldest, 
if least important, psi power — 
but I couldn’t even do anything 
like that. 

About all there was left for me 
was to take long walks. Athletics 
were out of the question; I 
couldn’t compete with psi-boys 
and they didn’t want to compete 
with me. All the people in the 
neighborhood knew me and were 
nice to me, but I didn’t need to 
be a ’path to tell what they were 
saying to one another when I 
hove into sight. “There’s that old- 
est Faraday boy. Pity, such a 
talented family, to have a defec- 
tive.” 

I didn’t have a girl, either. Al- 
though some of them were sort 
of attracted to me — I could see 
that — they could hardly go out 
with me without exposing them- 
selves to ridicule. In their sandals, 
I would have done the same 
thing, but that didn’t stop me 
from hating them. 

WISHED I had been born a 
couple of hundred years ago 
— before people started playing 



around with nuclear energy and 
filling the air with radiations that 
they were afraid would turn hu- 
man beings into hideous mon- 
sters. Instead, they developed the 
psi powers that had always been 
latent in the species until we de- 
veloped into a race of supermen. 
I don’t know why I say we — in 
1960 or so, I might have been 
considered superior, but in 2102 
I was just the Faradays’ idiot boy. 

Exploring space should have 
been my hope. If there had been 
anything useful or interesting on 
any of the other planets, I might 
have found a niche for myself 
there. In totally new surround- 
ings, the psi powers geared to 
another environment might not 
be an advantage. But by the time 
I was ten, it was discovered that 
the other planets were just barren 
hunks of rock, with pressures and 
climates and atmospheres dras- 
tically unsuited to human life. A 
year or so before, the hyperdrive 
had been developed on Earth and 
ships had been sent out to explore 
the stars, but I had no hope left 
in that direction any more. 

I was an atavism in a world of 
peace and plenty. Peace, because 
people couldn’t indulge in war or 
even crime with so many tele- 
paths running around — not be- 
cause, I told myself, the capacity 
for primitive behavior wasn’t just 
as latent in everybody else as the 
psi talent seemed latent in me.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Tim must be right, I thought — 
I must have some undreamed-of 
power that only the right circum- 
stances would bring out. But 
what was that power? 

For years I had speculated on 
what my potential talent might 
be, explored every wild possibil- 
ity I could conceive of and found 
none productive of even an am- 
biguous result with which I could 
fool myself. As I approached 
adulthood, I began to concede 
that I was probably nothing more 
than what I seemed to be — a 
simple psi-negative. Yet, from 
time to time, hope surged up 
again, as it had today, in spite of 
my knowledge that my hope was 
an impossibility. Who ever heard 
of latent psi powers showing 
themselves in an individual as 
old as twenty-six? 

I was almost alone in the parks 
where I used to walk, because 
people liked to commune with 
one another those days rather 
than with nature. Even garden- 
ing had very little popularity. 
But I found myself most at home 
in those woodland — or, rather, 
pseudo - woodland — surround- 
ings, able to identify more readily 
with the trees and flowers than 
I could with my own kind. A 
fallen tree or a broken blossom 
would excite more sympathy 
from me than the minor catastro- 
phes that will beset any house- 
hold, no matter how gifted, and 



I would shy away from bloody 
noses or cut fingers, thus giving 
myself a reputation for callous- 
ness as well as extrasensory im- 
becility. 

However, I was no more cal- 
lous in steering clear of human 
breakdowns than I was in not 
shedding tears over the house- 
hold machines when they broke 
down, for I felt no more closely 
akin to my parents and siblings 
than I did to the mechanisms 
that served and, sometimes, failed 
us. 

O N THAT DAY, I walked 
farther than I had intended 
and, by the time I got back home, 
I found the rest of my family had 
returned before me. They seemed 
to be excited about something 
and were surprised to see me so 
calm. 

“Aren’t you even interested in 
anything outside your own imme- 
diate concerns, Kev?” Sylvia de- 
manded, despite Father’s efforts 
to shush her. 

“Can’t you remember that Kev 
isn’t able to receive the tellies?” 
Tim shot back at her. “He prob- 
ably doesn’t even know what’s 
happened.” 

“Well, what did happen?” I 
asked, trying not to snap. 

“One starship got back from 
Alpha Centauri,” Danny said ex- 
citedly. “There are two inhabited 
Earth-type planets there!” 



JACK OF NO TRADES 



97 



This was for me; this was it at 
last! I tried not to show my en- 
thusiasm, though I knew that was 
futile. My relatives could keep 
their thoughts and emotions from 
me; I couldn’t keep mine from 
them. “What kind of life inhabits 
them? Humanoid?” 

“Uh-uh.” Danny shook his 
head. “And hostile. The crew of 
the starship says they were at- 
tacked immediately on landing. 
When they turned and left, they 
were followed here by one of the 
alien ships. Must be a pretty 
advanced race to have spaceships. 
Anyhow, the extraterrestrial ship 
headed back as soon as it got a 
fix on where ours was going.” 
“But if they’re hostile,” I said 
thoughtfully, “it might mean war.” 
“Of course. That’s why every- 
body’s so wrought up. We hope 
it’s peace, but we’ll have to pre- 
pare for war just in case.” 

There hadn’t been a war on 
Earth for well over a hundred 
years, but we hadn’t been so 
foolish as to obliterate all knowl- 
edge of military techniques and 
weapons. The alien ship wouldn’t 
be able to come back with rein- 
forcements — if such were its 
intention — in less than six 
months. This meant time to get 
together a stockpile of weapons, 
though we had no idea of how 
effective our defenses would be 
against the aliens’ armament. 
They might have strange and 



terrible weapons against which 
we would be powerless. On the 
other hand, our side would have 
the benefits of telekinetically 
guided missiles, teleported sabo- 
teurs, telepaths to pick up the 
alien strategy, and prognostica- 
tors to determine the outcome of 
each battle and see whether it 
was worth fighting in the first 
place. 

Everybody on Earth hoped for 
peace. Everybody, that is, except 
me. I had been unable to achieve 
any sense of identity with the 
world in which I lived, and it 
was almost worth the loss of per- 
sonal survival to know that my 
own smug species could look silly 
against a still more talented race. 

<*4TT ISN’T so much our de- 
fense that worries me,” my 
mother muttered, “as lack of ade- 
quate medical machinery. War is 
bound to mean casualties and 
there aren’t enough cure-alls on 
the planet to take care of them. 
It’s useless to expect the govern- 
ment to build more right now; 
they’ll be too busy producing 
weapons. Sylvia, you’d better 
take a leave of absence from 
your job and come down to Psy- 
cho Center to learn first-aid tech- 
niques. And you too, Kevin,” she 
added, obviously a little surprised 
herself at what she was saying. 
“Probably you’d be even better 
at it than Sylvia since you aren’t 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sensitive to other people’s pain.” 

I looked at her. 

“It is an ill wind,” she agreed, 
smiling wryly, “but don’t let me 
catch you thinking that way, 
Kevin. Can’t you see it would be 
better that there should be no 
war and you should remain use- 
less?” 

I couldn’t see it, of course, and 
she knew that, with her wretched 
talent for stripping away my 
feeble attempts at privacy. Psi- 
powers usually included some 
ability to form a mental shield; 
being without one, I was neces- 
sarily devoid of the other. 

My attitude didn’t matter, 
though, because it was definitely 
war. The aliens came back with 
a fleet clearly bent on our annihi- 
lation — even the ’paths couldn’t 
figure out their motives, for the 
thought pattern was entirely dif- 
ferent from ours — and the war 
was on. 

I had enjoyed learning first- 
aid; it was the first time I had 
ever worked with people as an 
equal. And I was good at it be- 
cause psi-powers aren’t much of 
an advantage there. Telekinesis 
maybe a little, but I was big 
enough to lift anybody without 
needing any superhuman abilities 
— normal human abilities, rather. 

“Gee, Mr. Faraday,” one of the 
other students breathed, “you’re 
so strong. And without ’kinesis 
or anything.” 



I looked at her and liked what 
I saw. She was blonde and pretty. 
“My name’s not Mr. Faraday,” I 
said. “It’s Kevin.” 

“My name’s Lucy,” she gig- 
gled. 

No girl had ever giggled at me 
in that way before. Immediately 
I started to envision a beautiful 
future for the two of us, then 
flushed when I realized that she 
might be a telepath. But she was 
winding a tourniquet around the 
arm of another member of the 
class with apparent unconcern. 

“Hey, quit that!” the windee 
yelled. “You’re making it too 
tight! I’ll be mortified!” 

So Lucy was obviously not a 
telepath. Later I found out she 
was only a low-grade telesensitive 
— just a poetess — so I had 
nothing to worry about as far as 
having my thoughts read went. I 
was a little afraid of Sylvia’s 
kidding me about my first ro- 
mance, but, as it happened, she 
got interested in one of the guys 
who was taking the class with 
us, and she was not only too busy 
to be bothered with me, but in 
too vulnerable a position herself. 

However, when the actual 
bombs — or their alien equiva- 
lent — struck near our town, I 
wasn’t nearly so happy, especial- 
ly after they started carrying the 
wounded into the Psycho Center, 
which had been turned into a 
hospital for the duration. I took 



JACK OF NO TRADES 



99 



one look at the gory scene — I 
had never seen anybody really 
injured before; few people had, 
as a matter of fact — and started 
for the door. But Mother was 
already blocking the way. It was 
easy to see from which side of 
the family Tim had got his talent 
for prognostication. 

“If the telepaths who can pick 
up all the pain can stand this, 
Kevin,” she said, “you certainly 
can.” And there was no kindness 
at all in the you. 

She gave me a shove toward 
the nearest stretcher. “Go on — 
now’s your chance to show you’re 
of some use in this world.” 

RITTING my teeth, I turned 
to the man on the stretcher. 
Something had pretty near torn 
half his face away. It was all 
there, but not in the right place, 
and it wasn’t pretty. I turned 
away, caught my mother’s eye, 
and then I didn’t even dare to 
throw up. I looked at that 
smashed face again and all the 
first-aid lessons I’d had flew out 
of my head as if some super-psi 
had plucked them from me. 

The man was bleeding terribly. 
I had never seen blood pouring 
out like that before. The first 
thing to do, I figured sickly, was 
mop it up. I wet a sponge and 
dabbed gingerly at the face, but 
my hands were shaking so hard 
that the sponge slipped and my 



fingers were on the raw gaping 
wound. I could feel the warm vis- 
cosity of the blood and nothing, 
not even my mother, could keep 
my meal down this time, I 
thought. 

Mother had uttered a sound of 
exasperation as I dropped the 
sponge. I could hear her coming 
toward me. Then I heard her 
gasp. I looked at my patient and 
my mouth dropped open. For 
suddenly there was no wound, no 
wound at all — just a little blood 
and the fellow’s face was whole 
again. Not even a scar. 

“Wha — wha happened?” he 
asked. “It doesn’t hurt any more!” 

He touched his cheek and 
looked up at me with frightened 
eyes. And I was frightened, too 
— too frightened to be sick, too 
frightened to do anything but 
stare witlessly at him. 

“Touch some of the others, 
quick!” my mother commanded, 
pushing astounded attendants 
away from stretchers. 

I touched broken limbs and 
torn bodies and shattered heads, 
and they were whole again right 
away. Everybody in the room 
was looking at me in the way I 
had always dreamed of being 
looked at. Lucy was opening and 
shutting her beautiful mouth like 
a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole 
thing was just like a dream, ex- 
cept that I was awake. I couldn’t 
have imagined all those horrors. 




TOO 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But the horrors soon weren’t 
horrors any more. I began to find 
them almost pleasing; the worse 
a wound was, the more I appre- 
ciated it. There was so much 
more satisfaction, virtually an es- 
thetic thrill, in seeing a horrible 
jagged tear smooth away, heal, 
not in days, as it would have 
done under the cure-all, but in 
seconds. 

“Timothy was right,” my 
mother said, her eyes filled with 
tears, “and I was wrong ever to 
have doubted. You have a gift, 
son — ” and she said the word 
son loud and clear so that every- 
body could hear it — “the great- 
est gift of all, that of healing.” 
She looked at me proudly. And 
Lucy and the others looked at 
me as if I were a god or some- 
thing. 

I felt . well, good. 

WONDER why we never 
thought of healing as a po- 
tential psi-power,” my mother 
said to me later, when I was 
catching a snatch of rest and she 
was lighting cigarettes and offer- 
ing me cups of coffee in an at- 
tempt to make up twenty-six 
years of indifference, perhaps dis- 
like, all at once. “The ability to 
heal is recorded in history, only 
we never paid much attention to 
it.” 

“Recorded?” I asked a little 
jealously. 



“Of course,” she smiled. “Re- 
member the King’s Evil?” 

I should have known without 
her reminding me, after all the 
old books I had read. “Scrofula, 
wasn’t it? They called it that be- 
cause the touch of certain kings 
was supposed to cure it . and 
other diseases, too, I guess.” 

She nodded. “Certain people 
must have had the healing power 
and that’s probably why they 
originally got to be the rulers.” 

In a very short time, I became 
a pretty important person. All 
the other deficients in the world 
were tested for the healing power 
and all of them turned out nega- 
tive. I proved to be the only 
human healer alive, and not only 
that, I could work a thousand 
times more efficiently and effec- 
tively than any of the machines. 
The government built a hospital 
just for my work! Wounded peo- 
ple were ferried there from all 
over the world and I cured them. 
I could do practically everything 
except raise the dead and some- 
times I wondered whether, with 
a little practice, I wouldn’t be 
able to do even that. 

When I came to my new office, 
whom did I find waiting there for 
me but Lucy, her trim figure en- 
hanced by a snug blue and white 
uniform. “I’m your assistant, 
Kev,” she said shyly. 

I looked at her. “You are?” 

“I — I hope you want me,” 



JACK OF NO TRADES 



101 



she went on, coyness now mixing 
with apprehension. 

I gave her shoulder a squeeze. 
“I do want you, Lucy. More than 
I can tell you now. After all this 
is over, there’s something more I 
want to say. But right now — ” I 
clapped her arm — “there’s a 
job to be done.” 

“Yes, Kevin,” she said, glaring 
at me for some reason I didn’t 
have time to investigate or in- 
terpret at the moment. My pa- 
tients were waiting for me. 

They gave me everything else 
I could possibly need, except 
enough sleep, and I myself didn’t 
want that. I wanted to heal. I 
wanted to show my fellow human 
beings that, though I couldn’t re- 
ceive or transmit thoughts or fore- 
tell the future or move things 
with my mind, all those powers 
were useless without life, and 
that was what I could give. 

I took pride in my work. It 
was good to stop pain and ugli- 
ness, to know that, if it weren’t 
for me, these people would be 
dead or permanently disfigured. 
In a sense, they were — well, my 
children; I felt a warm glow of 
affection toward them. 

They felt the same way toward 
me. I knew because the secret of 
the hospital soon leaked out — 
during all those years of peace, 
the government had lost what- 
ever facility it had for keeping 
secrets — and people used to 



come in droves, hoping for a 
glimpse of me. 

r I 'HE government pointed out 
that such crowds outside the 
building might attract the ene- 
my’s attention. I was the most 
important individual on Earth, 
they told my followers, and my 
safety couldn’t be risked. The 
human race at this stage was 
pretty docile. The crowds went 
away. And it was right that they 
should; I didn’t want to be risked 
any more than they wanted to 
risk me. 

Plenty of people did come to 
see me officially — the President, 
generals, all kinds of big wheels, 
bringing citations, medals and 
other obsolete honors they’d re- 
vived primarily for me. It was 
wonderful. I began to love every- 
body. 

“Don’t you think you’re putting 
too much of yourself into this, 
Kev?” Lucy asked me one day. 

I gave her an incredulous 
glance. “You mean I shouldn’t 
help people?” 

“Of course you should help 
them. I didn’t mean anything 
like that. Just . well, you’re 
getting too bound up in your 
work.” 

“Why shouldn’t I be?” Then 
the truth, as I thought, dawned 
on me. “Are you jealous, Lucy?” 

She lowered her eyes. “Not 
only that, but the war’s bound 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to come to an end, you know, 
and — ” 

It was the first part of her 
sentence that interested me. 
“Why, do you mean — ” 

And just then a fresh batch of 
casualties arrived and I had to 
tend to them. For the next few 
days, I was so busy, I didn’t get 
the chance to have the long talk 
with Lucy I’d wanted ... 

Then, after only four months, 
the war suddenly stopped. It 
seemed that the aliens’ weapons, 
despite their undeniable mysteri- 
ousness, were not equal to ours. 
And they had the added disad- 
vantage of being light-years away 
from home base. So the remnant 
of their fleet took off and blew 
itself up just outside of . Mars, 
which we understood to be the 
equivalent of unconditional sur- 
render. And it was; we never 
heard from the Centaurians again. 

Peace once more. I had a little 
mopping up to do at the hospital; 
then I collected my possessions 
and went back home after a dig- 
nitary — only the Vice President 
this time — had thanked me on 
behalf of a grateful country. I 
wasn’t needed any more. 

T^OR A WHILE, I was glad to 
be back home. I was a cel- 
ebrity. People dropped in from 
all around to see me and talk to 
me. And my family, basking in 
the reflection of glory, was nice 



to me ... for a while. 

“I don’t have any trouble mak- 
ing appointments with any firm,” 
my father boasted, “when I tell 
’em I’m the father of Kevin Fara- 
day.” 

Mother smiled approvingly — 
Tim, a little sadly. He was the 
only one who didn’t seem pleased 
by what had happened to me, 
even though he’d prophesied it. 

Sylvia slipped her arm through 
mine. “The agency wondered 
whether you wouldn’t give them 
a testimonial for Panacetic Pills, 
Kev,” she said, squeezing my 
arm. “They’d pay a lot, and the 
rest of the family sure could use 
the money if you’re too high- 
minded to accept it.” 

“I couldn’t do a thing like that, 
Sylvia. It wouldn’t be ethical.” 
“Why wouldn’t it be?” She 
dropped my arm. “The pills 
couldn’t possibly hurt anybody. 
Maybe take a little business away 
from Mother, but Mother doesn’t 
mind, do you, dear?” 

Mother frowned. 

“But people would think the 
pills had my healing powers,” I 
explained. “I would be breaking 
faith with myself if I shilled for 
them.” 

Sylvia snorted. “Breaking faith 
with himself. Look who’s talking!” 
“Sylvia,” my mother said. 
“Please.” 

But Sylvia went on — she was 
in an overwrought state because 



JACK OF NO TRADES 



103 



her guy hadn’t called her, though 
that was no reason to take it out 
on me. “Who needs healing 
power now? The machines can 
cope with all peacetime ailments. 
Better take your loot while the 
getting’s good, Kev.” 

“Nevertheless, Kevin is right, 
Sylvia,” my mother said. “He 
mustn’t prostitute his talent.” 

“And we don’t actually need 
the money the testimonial could 
bring in, no matter how much it 
is,” my father said a little wist- 
fully. “I can support my family.” 

Tim sighed. 

The months went on. Once 
again there was nothing for me 
to do, only it was worse for me 
now because I had tasted useful- 
ness and fame. People did come 
for a while with their headaches 
and cut fingers for me to heal, 
and I was happy healing them 
until I realized they were just 
coming to make me feel good. 
They didn’t really need me. Any- 
body who had anything seriously 
wrong with him went to a psy- 
chiatrist or a machine, same as 
always. I healed them too quickly 
for them to have time to take 
pleasure in it. They couldn’t talk 
for days about a three-second 
operation. 

T> Y AND BY, even the cut 
fingers didn’t come. Maybe 
I hadn’t been exactly gracious 
toward the end. Maybe the whole 

704 



thing was my fault. Even the 
Lucy business. My mother said 
it was, anyhow. 

You see, Lucy lived quite a 
distance away and we couldn’t 
call each other up because of my 
not being able to use the tellies. 
We wrote and I went to see her 
a few times, and then she came 
to meet my family. Once. 

It was a ghastly evening. We 
all sat around stiffly, my family 
being excessively polite to her, 
thinking, I knew, that this was 
my only chance to get myself a 
wife and so they’d better be nice 
to the girl, no matter what she 
was like. And seeing her with 
what I fancied to be their eyes, 
I realized that she wasn’t out- 
standingly pretty, particularly 
bright, or even very talented. 

And what was she thinking? 
That she had got herself virtually 
engaged to a useless half-sense 
because he had had a brief mo- 
ment of glory as a war hero? 
Trapped with this imbecile and 
his dull, stuffy family, and not 
being able to get out of it with- 
out being cruel? 

What were they actually think- 
ing? I didn’t know. But they did 
— Mother knew what everybody 
was thinking, right down to the 
last convolution of the subcon- 
scious mind and Sylvia knew 
what everyone else was feeling, 
and the others . they knew or 
at least sensed part of what was

t 



going on. But I was impercipient, 
I couldn’t tell anything, I was 
excluded — out in the cold — 
and, being unable ever really to 
know, was forced to draw the 
worst conclusions. 

I took Lucy home that eve- 
ning. They had to trust me that 
far alone because it would have 
looked absurd for Danny or Tim 
to come along as chaperone, and 
anyway I had been there alone 
before, when I had gone to see 
her. 

“Lucy,” I said as we stood awk- 
wardly before her door, “I don’t 
want you to feel, just because of 
what might have happened in a 
burst of — of patriotic fervor, 
that you’re bound or — ” 

“No, Kevin,” she murmured, 
without looking at me. “I under- 
stand. I don’t feel bound or — 
committed in any way. And you 
mustn’t feel bound, either.” 

“That’s good.” I felt a deep 
sense of sorrow working its way 
down to settle in my viscera and, 
if she’d had much perceptiveness, 
things might have been different 
then. But she hadn’t. I took a 
deep breath, determined to carry 
my heartbreak off with dignity. 
“Well, good-by, Lucy.” 

A LTHOUGH she had never 
J -*- really been close to me — in 
fact, I had nevef so much as 
kissed her — I felt lonelier now, 
without even the hope of her, 



than I ever had before. I began 
to take my long walks in the 
park again, brooding over the 
power that might have been mine, 
if only I hadn’t been such a damn 
fool as to give freely without ask- 
ing anything in return. During the 
war, I could have got anything 
I wanted in exchange for what 
I’d done, or, rather, for what I 
could do, but I’d been too busy 
healing. Now it was too late for 
asking. 

Nature, being all I had left, 
became closer to me than ever 
before. And one morning, after a 
violent storm the night before, I 
mourned over the fallen trees and 
smashed flowers as I had never 
mourned over fallen and smashed 
men — first, because I hadn’t 
cared, and then because I had 
known I could help. 

Come to think of it, how did 
I know it was only people I could 
help? 

“Mother,” I said eagerly when 
I came home that evening, “I can 
heal other things besides people! 
Trees and shrubs and — ” 

“That’s nice, dear. Perhaps we 
can get you a job with the Park 
Department if you’re tired of sit- 
ting home, and in the meantime 
you’d better comb those leaves 
out of your hair. Sylvia, did you 
call that techno?” 

“Yes, Mother,” Sylvia said 
gloomily. Her guy still hadn’t 
called. Knowing now how she 



JACK OF NO TRADES

must feel, I could feel sorry for 
her. “It said it’ll be over as soon 
as it can, but that it might take 
days.” 

“We’ll have to eat synthetics 
for dinner if that stove isn’t fixed 
soon,” my mother said fretfully, 
and went off into the kitchen to 
mess around with the machinery 
and thus make certain the techno 
had a real hard job on its hands 
when it finally did show up. 

Oh, the devil with it, I thought. 
No use hoping to interest the 
family in any extension of my 
gift that had no practical value 
except for nature lovers. I might 
as well seize such meager chances 
as were still open to me. I wasn’t 
going to be an idealistic idiot any 
longer. 

“Sylvie,” I said to my sister, 
“I’ve changed my mind about 
that testimonial.” 

She looked blankly at me out 
of her reverie. “What testi- 
monial?” 

“The — you know, the Panace- 
tic Pills.” 

She laughed and patted me on 
the shoulder, not unkindly, be- 
cause she could probably feel a 
sympathy in me now that she 
never could before. “Too late for 
that, honey. Your name wouldn’t 
mean a thing any more.” 

So many of them owed their 
lives to me — and yet they had 
forgotten me. 

Tim looked at me. “Be careful, 

106 



Kev,” he said anxiously. 

“Careful of what?” 

“I don’t know exactly.” He ran 
his hand through his hair. “But 
be careful, won’t you?” 

Just at that moment, an easy 
chair floated in from the next 
room, banged into me, swerved, 
and crashed into a table. Danny, 
who had been thinking of going 
into interior decoration as a side- 
line to his business, had been 
making the furniture leap with- 
out looking first. 

1 GAVE TIM a reproachful 
glance as I used my gift to 
heal my bruised shin. “You might 
have been a little more explicit,” 
I complained. “I’m no ’path.” 

“I didn’t mean — ” But Danny 
caromed into Tim on his way to 
inspect the damage. My whole 
family was so used to relying on 
their psi powers that they were 
pretty clumsy when it came to 
using the merely physical ones. 

Danny looked sadly at the 
wreckage. The chair was only 
nicked, but the table was pretty 
well smashed. “Gee, Kev,” he said 
mournfully, “if only you could 
fix furniture the way you fix up 
people.” 

“I can heal trees,” I said. “And 
they’re wood.” 

“So try the table,” Sylvia pro- 
posed. “It’s going to cost you 
anything?” 

Danny looked at me hopefully. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I went over and touched the 
table. At first nothing happened. 
And then the shattered bits of 
wood sort of shimmered together 
and it was whole again. 

Danny’s and Sylvia’s eyes 
bugged out. So did mine, as a 
matter of fact. Only Tim didn’t 
look surprised, just a little sadder. 

Mother appeared from the 
kitchen so fast, you’d think she’d 
caught teleportation from Father. 
“Kevin!” she cried, her eyes shin- 
ing with an enthusiasm that my 
healing of people had never 
evoked in her. She was a con- 
scientious psychiatrist, but a pas- 
sionate cook. “Come in here and 
see what you can do with this 
stove.” 

My siblings treading on my 
heels, I went in and fixed it. Like 
that. She looked at me with genu- 
ine mother love in her eyes. “My 
boy,” she breathed adoringly. 

“Pianos!” Danny yelped sud- 
denly. Everybody looked at him. 
“If you worked along with me, 
Kev,” he explained, “nobody 
would ever have to know if I 
dropped ’em. I could be a senior 
executive and no questions 
asked.” 

“But that wouldn’t be ethical,” 
Sylvia suggested, with a sidelong 
glance at me. 

“My ethical values have come 
down to Earth,” I said. “Be glad 
to help you out, Dan. And the 
same goes for you, Sylvie. ‘Use 



Kevin Faraday. A Million Times 
More Efficient than Glue.’ Noth- 
ing for nothing any more, though 
— I have to be as professional 
as everybody and I’ve got a ca- 
reer to get started.” 

Sylvia sighed. “I wish there 
were other things you could fix 
besides people and furniture. In- 
tangibles.” 

“Like broken hearts, maybe?” 

She smiled. “Maybe.” 

“I’ll try,” I said, and I con- 
centrated. 

Just then, the telliebell rang 
and Tim, being youngest, went 
to answer it. When he came back, 
he was smiling. “For you, Sylvie. 
Lennie.” 

“Lennie!” Sylvia yelped joy- 
ously. She ran toward the tellie, 
dashed back, planted a wet kiss 
on my cheek, and scurried off to 
the booth. 

“Well, gosh!” Danny said. 

“Maybe it’s going to be all 
right,” Tim said, precognizing 
hard. “Power doesn’t necessarily 
corrupt.” 

“You could make that part of 
your service, Kev,” Danny sug- 
gested. “Mending broken hearts, 
I mean, not corrupting. Hey, 
where are you going?” 

“To catch a helibus,” I said. 
“There’s a broken heart that 
needs fixing immediately. And 
it’s for me, so nothing for nothing 
still goes.”

it is not to be missed! The Space

This story of our civilization

Now read what has happened to 
GEORGE ADAMSKI since he wrote 
the famous incidents in Flying 

Saucers Have Landed INSIDE THE SPACE 

SHIPS is Adamski's own story of what has happened to him since 
that memorable November 20, 1952, when he first made personal 
contact with a man from another world . since December 13, 
1952, when he took the first photographs of the same saucer that 
brought his original visitor. 




• Now he tells of his first meeting, a 
few months later, with a second man 
from another world— his first meeting 
with one who speaks to him. This 
second visitor brings him to a Venu- 
sian Scout (flying saucer) and this, in 
turn, brings him to a mother ship. 
Later he is conveyed in both a Satur- 
nian Scout and a Saturnian mother 
ship. Adamski tells us what trans- 
pires in these space craft and what 
the men and women from other 
worlds have told him. 



• Adamski's photographs of flying 
saucers, originally published in FLY- 
ING SAUCERS HAVE LANDED, have 
since become world-famous as other 
witnesses in other parts of the world 
have succeeded in taking photographs 
identical with his. 



• Now, in INSIDE THE SPACE SHIPS, 
Adamski gives us 16 photographs and 
other illustrations, not only of the 
flying saucers, but of the great space 
ships from which they are launched. 
The main group of these photographs 
was taken in April, 1955— and neither 
the photographs nor a description of 
them has ever before been published!

copied the pseudo-hail-fellow- 
well-met verbiage of the male 
side of advertising; and in view 
of what the protagonist has to 
report, the parody is almost ach- 
ingly funny — and sometimes 
mighty bawdy. 

The book makes 1984 look 
like a funeral march (which, of 
course, it was). In a way, this 
one is too — but with guffaws! 

GLADIATOR AT LAW by 
Frederik Pohl and C. M. Korn- 
bluth. Ballantine Books, $2.00 
Cloth and 35c Paper 

HE THIRD Pohl-Kornbluth 
collaboration to see book 
publication is entirely different 
from Gravy Planet (otherwise 
known as The Space Merchants ), 
but nevertheless it is a good 
swift anti-utopia in something of 
the same tradition. Galaxy 
readers will remember the story: 
how the descendants of the in- 
ventor of the Perfect House fin- 
ally win their rights through the 
skills and daring of a small-time 
lawyer, helped by some child 
gangs and, of course, by chance. 

In this world of tomorrow, to- 
day’s suburbs have become un- 
speakable slums; the economy is 
divided (as in The Space Mer- 
chants ) between huge monopo- 
lies; and the “bread and circuses” 
of the Romans are back in newer, 
shinier and crueler form as means 

no 



of popular entertainment. 

The circuses are — well, if you 
read the serial, you’ll shudder as 
you remember; if not, read this 
book and gnaw your knuckles. 

As a matter of fact, you’ll want 
to read the book again even if 
you’ve read it in serial form. It’s 
a grimly unforgettable item that 
delivers an extra punch on a 
second reading. 

A WAY HOME by Theodore 
Sturgeon. Funk & W agnails Co., 
$3.50 

O UTSIDE of a rather stuffy 
introduction by your re- 
viewer, this book is pure gold. 
It’s Sturgeon’s third short story 
collection, and the first which 
is predominantly science fiction 
rather than fantasy. There is not 
a lemon among the eleven items 
included; indeed, for my money 
(but I must note that I am a 
fall-guy for Sturgeon’s work) 
there is nothing rating less than 
A. 

Many of the items are already 
well-known: “The Hurkle Is a 
Happy Beast,” “Mewhu’s Jet,” 
“Thunder and Roses,” “Tiny and 
the Monster,” and “Minority Re- 
port” — all hitherto anthologized. 

Others are either very recent 
or not so well known and are 
new to book form: “Hurricane 
Trio,” “Bulkhead” (originally 
called “Who?”), “Special Apti- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tude” (originally called “Last 
Laugh), “And My Fear Is Great,” 
and “A Way Home.” 

The book exhibits almost every 
facet of Sturgeon’s rich endow- 
ments in imagination, storytell- 
ing ability, mood evocation, idea 
development, humor, and just 
plain brilliant writing. 

If you want to introduce liter- 
ate people who are science fiction 
novices to our favorite form of 
reading, this is the book for them. 

Of course, it’s for you, too! 

ADDRESS : CENTAURI by 
F. L. Wallace. Gnome Press, 
$3.00 

A NYONE WHO remembers 
Wallace’s “Accidental Flight” 
from a 1952 Galaxy will cer- 
tainly want this book. It carries 
that superb tale to its logical 
conclusion in another star system. 

For those who did not read 
the original story, let it be said 
that it — and the novel growing 
from it — are both based on a 
uniquely powerful concept: a fu- 
ture world in which disease is 
conquered but accidents are not. 

People badly disfigured by ac- 
cidents or malformation are 
brought back to life, all right, but 
they are not allowed to live on 
Earth, where everyone is now 
beautiful. They have a planetoid 
of their own — and a number 
of remarkable skills, too. 



The story relates how these 
“accidentals” turn their little 
planet into a gravity-propelled 
spaceship and take it out to the 
Centauri system, where they find 
themselves a habitable planet of 
their own. 

It sounds simple, I know, but 
Wallace has so enriched the idea 
with a memorably colorful set of 
characters and melodramatic cir- 
cumstances that it becomes an 
unforgettable tale. 

CITY OF GLASS by Noel 
Loomis. Columbia Publications, 
35c 

T’M SORRY to have to report 

that Noel Loomis’ first pub- 
lished novel (serialized in 1942) 
is a pretty poor job. Its charac- 
ters are wooden and its style 
sometimes unbearably amateur. 
The plot has its ingenious points, 
but it also is hardly breathtaking 
in its originality. 

The story is about a crew of 
three humans who return to 
Earth from the first near-light- 
speed journey in space to find 
(natch) the world is a lot older 
than it was when they left a few 
weeks before. The old mass-time 
paradox, you know. As a matter 
of fact, it’s 800,000 years older 
and an odd race of “Glass- Men” 
are fighting off the attacks of 
some bestial remnants of human- 
ity who live in caves.

Loomis has an active imagina- 
tion and if only the book were 
better conceived and written, it 
could be recommended as a good, 
though minor, addition to science 
fiction’s dreams of the far-distant 
future. 

As it is, I can only suggest 
that you won’t, at the price, lose 
much by trying it. 

THE MARTIAN WAY AND 
OTHER STORIES by Isaac Asi- 
mov. Doubleday & Co., $2.95 

T HIS collection is actually a 
careful selection and is, of 
course, a worthwhile item — as 
is almost everything that Mr. 
Asimov turns out. 

Two novelets from Galaxy 
(the title story and “The Deep”), 
one from Astounding (“Sucker 
Bait”), and another (“Youth”) 
from one of Space Publication’s 
magazines make up the 222-page 
collection. 

Asimov addicts will have to 
have it. And those who are new 
to his work will find it an excel- 
lent introduction to the style and 
the imagination of one of science 
fiction’s important writers. 

There’s a thriller on Martian 
colonization and a water short- 
age; another on invaders from 
space which carries a terrific 
kicker in its tail; a different sort 
of invasion story in which the 
people of a far planet make con- 

112 



tact with an Earth human (who 
doesn’t know it!) for lifesaving 
purposes; and a galactic explora- 
tion novelet in which a most 
annoying young man with an in- 
satiable curiosity and an eidetic 
memory saves the lives of the 
spaceship crew very much against 
their wills. 

Four science fiction adventures 
at the top of Asimov’s best. 

UNDER THE TRIPLE SUNS 
by Stanton A. Coblentz. Fantasy 
Press, $3.00 

T HE JACKET says, “A brand 
new science novel never pub- 
lished before in any form,” and 
I cannot say I’m surprised by 
that fact. Any story that uses the 
word “orbs” as a synonym for 
eyes puts itself pretty well be- 
hind the eight ball as far as I 
am concerned. 

If the tale had any striking 
originality, I might forgive the 
Victorian style, but it has noth- 
ing new or even interesting to 
offer, at least to me. 

The world’s been destroyed by 
a “Cosmic Blight,” no less, and 
three humans — boy, girl, boy 
— escape to an alien planet, 
where they help to save a race 
of birdlike people called Lilbro 
from a race of monsters known 
as Ugwugs. 

You can take it from there.

The Lights 
on Precipice Peak 

By STEPHEN TALL 

Illustrated by NEWMAN 

How warm should a handshake 
be? The answer may be more 
vital than you could guess! 



T HE THREE young men 
sat quietly and watched 
the faint eerie glow. It 
was ruddy and small, a spot of 
dull red color. For perhaps five 
or six minutes it showed, moving 
slowly along what seemed to be 



the lip of Bighorn Glacier, six 
miles away and seven thousand 
feet up in the thin cold air. Then 
it vanished. 

John Drinkard lowered his 
binoculars. “Well, that’s that. You 
can see it, but still you can’t. The

glasses don’t help a bit.” 

“Spooks!” said Chuck Evers. 
He wriggled his muscular shoul- 
ders, slipped down onto the small 
of his back in the chair, and 
propped long legs on the porch 
railing. 

“Spooks?” Carl Royston’s brow 
wrinkled puzzedly. Drinkard and 
Evers both watched with sup- 
pressed amusement as his face 
suddenly cleared and he almost 
smiled. “Ah, yes, apparitions.” 
“Haunts,” Chuck said. “Hob- 
goblins. Ghosts. Banshees.” 

“Banshees wail,” said Drinkard. 
Royston’s pale eyes glowed 
with interest. “This you can say 
for the lights of Precipice Peak 
— they are quiet.” 

“Are you sure?” John Drink- 
ard asked. “How do you know 
that every coyote you hear is a 
coyote?” 

“At any rate,” said Royston, 
“if they make sounds, they are 
the sounds of the country.” He 
shivered slightly. “A miserable 
country.” he added. 

John Drinkard was thick and 
blocky, with big hands and a 
square chin. Chuck Evers was 
long and sinewy. Beside them, 
Royston seemed a pale, slight 
figure, his thin face sallow, his 
shoulders ever hunched against 
the crisp western air. 

“You are speaking of the land 
I love,” said Chuck Evers. “If you 
don’t like it, why stay around?” 

114 



TJOYSTON shrugged. “It is 
supposed to make me a man 
of vigor, with red corpuscles and 
a need for cold shower baths. 
Actually, there is nothing wrong 
with me. I was simply born to 
sit and watch while great louts 
like you run and wrestle and 
climb and sweat.” He shifted his 
gaze to the peak, now a dark sil- 
houette against the ice-clear stars. 
“There, the light shows again.” 

Slowly the red glow progressed 
along a cliff face, much higher 
than it had before. For minutes 
it moved along steadily, then 
faded. 

“That thing,” said Evers sud- 
denly, “was goin’ along Fifth 
Avenue. Spooks don’t need a 
route of ascent, even up Preci- 
pice. All of a sudden, the lights 
of Precipice Peak are gettin’ 
solid. I got a feelin’ they’ll leave 
sign.” 

“Sign?” Royston’s voice went 
up in the darkness. There was 
the familiar pause, then Royston’s 
satisfied tone: “Ah, yes, traces.” 

“Right — traces, tracks, spoor. 
Only mystery about those lights 
is, we don’t know who makes 
them. But they’re gettin’ to be a 
tourist attraction. Maybe that’s 
a lead.” 

“How many trips have there 
been up Precipice this season?” 
Royston queried softly. 

“Fifteen or so,” John Drinkard 
said, “and the boy has some- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing. Any sign on Fifth Avenue 
or across Bighorn would have 
been seen by now. There’ve been 
some good mountain men on the 
Peak this summer. Some of ’em 
don’t miss much.” 

Royston hugged his narrow 
shoulders and made himself 
small in his chair, shivering again 
as the chill mountain breeze blew 
across the porch of the Lodge. 

“Over the swamps of my native 
Louisiana, where I wish I now 
was, I have seen balls of fire go 
drifting. It is swamp gas, me- 
thane, slowly oxidizing and glow- 
ing. Could this on the mountain 
be something like?” 

“It’s almost impossible,” said 
Evers. “And anyhow,” he added 
stubbornly, “balls of gases 
wouldn’t follow a trail. Those 
blasted lights do.” 

John Drinkard rose easily, 
stretched his thick arms wide. 

“Tomorrow, Chuck, tomor- 
row!” he reminded. “Take it easy, 
boy. Tomorrow you can look for 
yourself, remember? At < day- 
break, we go up to solve the 
mystery of the lights.” 

“Ghastly,” said Royston. “To 
go out at dawn is as bad as eating 
raw flesh. But tap on my cabin 
door when you go by. I will wave 
to you from the window.” 

J OHN DRINKARD swung his 
nailed short boots along the 
trail with a steady, satisfying 



rhythm. Ahead of him, Chuck 
Evers set the pace, an easy, loose- 
jointed shamble that ate up the 
mountain miles. They were a 
good team. They felt the trail 
alike. 

Drinkard swelled his big chest, 
then exhaled gustily, as though 
to expel the last of the tainted 
air of the settlements below. He 
warmed slowly to a climb ap- 
proach and he would have liked 
a breather. Ahead, the trail 
switched back sharply. 

At the switchback, Evers broke 
his stride, swung the packsack 
from his shoulders and leaned 
his long frame against a boulder. 

“Break,” he said. “I heard you 
heave like a foundered mule.” 

John Drinkard grinned. He 
shrugged off his own pack. “It’ll 
be good to enjoy the view and 
not have to look at your silly 
hat.” 

Chuck tilted the Swiss moun- 
taineer’s hat, complete with eagle 
feather. 

“These are the Alps of Ameri- 
ca,” he observed, “so my hat is 
fitting.” 

“It doesn’t even fit you,” said 
Drinkard. 

Forests of lodgepole pine and 
spruce lay below them. Already 
the resort town seemed a toy 
settlement at the edge of the 
valley, and the sagebrush world 
stretched away east to the hori- 
zon. To the north, the big peaks

of the range tumbled in a mas- 
sive, orderly row, with lakes flash- 
ing along their bases and a vast 
and timbered plateau rearing up 
beyond. 

It was West, good American 
West, twentieth century and 
solid, with clean cold mountain 
air, yellow sunlight on the cliffs 
and snowfields above. As if by 
signal, both men turned their 
gazes upward. The cutback was 
a vantage point from which could 
be seen the jumble of ridges and 
crags surmounted by the glisten- 
ing white expanse of Bighorn 
Glacier and, higher still, the 
seamed front of the eastern face 
of the mountain, tapering upward 
to the pinnacle of the peak. 

The men swung up their pack- 
sacks and shook hands. 

“Good luck, friend,” said John 
Drinkard. “Let’s go and see if 
our names are still on the register 
up there.” 

“Good luck,” said Evers. “To- 
night we’ll be up where the lights 
are. Punch me if you see one 
first.” 

“Lights, nuts,” John Drinkard 
said. “There’ll be none while 
we’re on the peak. Five bucks 
says so.” 

Evers raised his eyebrows. “I’m 
not a rich man, but I love a 
sporting chance. Here’s my five. 
Where’ll we put ’em?” 

Drinkard fumbled in his jacket 
pocket, brought out a tobacco tin. 

116 



He poured the remaining tobacco 
into a pouch and held out the tin. 

“Stick it in there,” he said. 
“Here’s mine.” 

A few paces off the trail, John 
Drinkard pried up a stone, slip- 
ped the tin underneath. 

“Lights, yours; no lights, mine. 
Right?” 

“Right,” said Evers, and he 
grinned at the little added spice 
for the two days ahead. 

* I "'HEIR steady plodding pas- 
sage up the ever-dimming 
trail was an appreciative one. Go- 
ing into the world above the 
trees was one of the good things 
of a peak climb. Hoary marmots 
whistled from their rocks, conies 
scurried, brown- and gray-barred 
ptarmigan crouched almost in- 
visibly among the gaudy alpine 
fields of avens and mountain sun- 
flowers and tiny forget-me-nots. 

At near dusk, they laid out 
their bedrolls on a level bit of 
tundra in the lee of a massive 
outcrop near Bighorn Glacier. A 
small fire of dead branches of 
firs and pines that literally 
crawled on their bellies at this 
altitude cooked a kettle of stew 
and heated the water for tea. 

The men went through the 
simple chores of an evening 
camp with the ease that comes 
when things have been done 
many times. And when Chuck 
Evers walked a few paces from 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the fire, stepped on a small stone 
that rolled with his weight, he 
felt with a sort of irritated sur- 
prise the little thread of pain that 
ran through his ankle. Tentative- 
ly he tested the foot, then hob- 
bled back to the fire. He knew 
that he wouldn’t climb the peak 
in the morning. 

He said nothing to big John 
until he had stripped off the boot 
and heavy sock. Then, as Drink- 
ard came back to the fire with 
more wood, he held out the bal- 
looning ankle. 

“How are you at taping, 
friend?” he asked casually. 

Drinkard looked at the foot, 
already purpling as it swelled. 
He reached for his first-aid kit. 

“Well, anyway,” he said re- 
signedly, “you got close enough 
to watch for lights.” 

Evers set his teeth as Drink- 
ard’s big fingers probed the 
sprain. 

“We’ll pack ice on it,” Drinkard 
decided, “then tape it in an hour. 
Maybe it’s a simple twist.” 

“You know it isn’t.” 

“Sure,” admitted Drinkard. “I 
thought you wanted to be cheer- 
ful, that’s all. It’s like when I 
broke three ribs climbing to look 
into a bird’s nest the day before 
we were tackling the East Face 
of Long’s. Then you were chin- 
up.” 

“That was different,” said 
Evers. “I wasn’t hurting.” 



THE LIGHTS ON PRECIPICE PEAK 



117 



When the stars were out and 
the quarter moon rose from the 
plains, John Drinkard got up 
from his bedroll seat by the fire. 
The two men had sat talking 
quietly for an hour. Evers’ ankle 
was taped and he was easing it 
before him as best he could. 

“I’m going to have a look be- 
fore I turn in,” said Drinkard. 
“My five still says there won’t 
be lights, but the technical crew 
may be monkeying around some- 
where.” 

“Take it easy,” Chuck Evers 
said. 

“I’ll just skirt along the edge 
of the glacier. Back in half an 
hour. You take it easy!” 

"T|RINKARD knew Bighorn 
Glacier. Its crevasses were 
so consistent that they were 
shown on maps. He carried his 
ice axe, but had no mind to use 
it. Only after he had worked his 
way for a number of minutes 
along the edge of the moonlit ice 
sheet did the whim to cross it 
seize him. The glacier had a good 
snow covering. The going was 
easy and the view was something 
few men see. 

Drinkard automatically avoid- 
ed the big ice cracks, then slipped 
through a snow roof into a shal- 
low, temporary one. He wasn’t 
hurt. The moonlight from the 
crack above showed his ice axe 
beside him. It was a lucky fall, 

118 



except for the fact that he 
couldn’t get out again. 

Time after time, he tried to 
dig hand- and foot-holes into the 
splintery icewall. But he was 
freezing his fingers and making 
no headway. He was stoutly but 
not heavily clothed. The cold be- 
gan to bite into him. He settled 
himself on his heels quietly and 
tried to decide what to do. 

After an hour, Chuck Evers be- 
gan to call. John Drinkard knew 
that if he answered, Chuck would 
probably attempt the ice himself. 
Evers’ voice came now in meas- 
ured, regular yips. And, while 
John wavered, from the crags 
above the glacier he was an- 
swered. It was a strange voice, 
yet oddly not unfamiliar. To 
John Drinkard it was muffled, but 
it had a reassuring sound. 

Drinkard waited in silence. 
Not many minutes later, a dark 
silhouette showed in the narrow 
crack of sky above. From the 
voice’s first call, Drinkard had 
realized that they had been 
watched, probably all day. 

“Are you injured?” asked the 
man’s odd voice. 

“I’m okay,” Drinkard said. 
“Just drop me a rope and I can 
walk up the wall. Mind the snow 
ledge. I didn’t — and look at me.” 

The man chuckled. “A joke,” 
he said, almost tentatively. “Here 
is the rope.” 

John Drinkard caught the loop 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lowered to him. Its texture was 
strange to his mountaineer’s 
hands. It was down-soft, warm to 
the touch, and he felt its strength 
instinctively. He climbed it easi- 
ly, hand over hand. The stranger 
stood three strides back from the 
crevasse lip, negligently holding 
the rope with one heavy-gaunt- 
leted hand — yet he was slender, 
slight of build, and when Drink- 
ard rose to his feet, he towered 
over his rescuer. 

Big John thrust out his hand. 
“Well, thanks. Lucky for me 
somebody has sense enough to 
walk around ice cracks.” 

The man seemed to hesitate, 
then extended his own gloved 
hand. 

“You must not mind the glove,” 
he said. “It is for your protection. 
The hand has not yet cooled.” 

J OHN DRINKARD was glad 
of the dimness of the moon- 
light, for his jaw dropped. But 
the man turned promptly away. 

“Come,” he said, “I have made 
an easy way. The one with the 
swollen foot is concerned for 
you.” 

John Drinkard, who had 
climbed scores of peaks up and 
down the Rockies, followed and 
felt like a tenderfoot. The man’s 
odd voice and stilted phrases 
tantalized him, yet he knew they 
were not entirely strange. And 
the matter of the hot hand . 



Drinkard dropped back a 
couple of paces. The man was 
setting his booted feet into a line 
of holes that had not been on 
the glacier earlier; Drinkard 
would have sworn to that. They 
made the traverse of the ice field 
a simple matter. 

As they approached the gla- 
cier’s edge, Drinkard realized 
that he could see his companion 
with an amazing clarity. He 
seemed limned with a dim red 
glow, which grew brighter with 
each step. In a few moments, he 
became as a man outlined in 
flame, and Drinkard could feel a 
warmth radiating from him. Yet 
the snow did not melt under his 
tread. 

“It is the boots,” said his guide, 
just as though Drinkard had 
spoken his thoughts aloud. “They 
insulate.” 

John Drinkard held onto his 
poise with something of an effort. 

“Thank you,” he managed 
drily. “Not only do you light up, 
but you pick brains. They’re both 
good tricks.” 

The man ahead chuckled ten- 
tatively. “A joke,” he said, but it 
was almost a question. 

“He really doesn’t know,” 
thought John Drinkard in aston- 
ishment. 

“That is true,” admitted his 
guide. “Everything else I under- 
stand with ease. Even the many 
kinds of speech are not difficult. 



THE LIGHTS ON PRECIPICE PEAK 



119 



But only on Earth are there 
jokes. We can never be sure 
about them.” 

“We, huh? I thought a gag 
like this would take cooperation. 
How many of you boys are in 
on it?” 

They had left the ice and were 
threading along the little ledge 
that gave onto the boulder field. 

“We are four,” said the man. 
He seemed to sense no sarcasm 
in the question. Drinkard noted, 
almost without surprise, that the 
ruddy glow had faded completely 
and that the man was simply a 
dark silhouette ahead. 

T HEY REACHED the tundra 
and Chuck Evers’ voice 
hailed them from close by. He 
sat near the tiny fire, the taped 
foot and ankle eased on a pack- 
sack before him. 

“Well,” said Evers, “you took 
your time.” 

“I fell in a crevasse,” John 
Drinkard said, “and I owe you 
five bucks.” 

“You should put the more im- 
portant statement first, but we 
can take that up later. I see we 
have company.” 

“I’m sorry.” His rescue from 
the crevasse and the little trek 
back across the glacier had been 
like something from a dream to 
John Drinkard. But now, with 
the familiar figure of Chuck 
across the fire, things suddenly 

120 



assumed their proper proportions 
again. 

He faced his guide, who 
stood silently by. 

“This is Chuck Evers. I’m 
afraid I didn’t catch your name.” 

The man’s thin face showed 
palely from the peaked hood that 
covered his head and disap- 
peared into the bulky collar of 
his stout, steel-smooth jacket. 

“I am called Dzell,” he said 
quietly. 

The two men stared at him, 
and he returned their looks with 
composure. 

“It’s different, anyway,” said 
Chuck finally. 

“Yes,” agreed the man. “That 
is because I am different.” 

“He can read your head like 
a crystal ball and light up like 
a neon sign,” John Drinkard 
heard himself babbling. 

Evers, though he sensed the 
strangeness of the situation, 
turned to Drinkard with concern. 
“Easy, boy,” he said soothingly. 
“You’ve slipped on the ice be- 
fore. Sit down and let’s quit be- 
ing funny.” 

The stranger smiled, but his 
curving lips seemed more a 
studied imitation than any indi- 
cation of mirth. “Let us all sit 
and I will tell you why I am 
Dzell. I will do it because I know, 
when you repeat my words, that 
you will not be believed.” 

Evers started to speak, thought 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



better of it, and closed his mouth 
with an exaggerated snap of teeth. 
John Drinkard sat wearily on 
the soft tundra vegetation. 

“You came up to climb the 
peak,” said the man Dzell, “but 
also you came to see what caused 
the lights. If you had not had 
misfortune, you would have 
climbed the peak, but there 
would have been no lights.” 

TT E GLANCED away, up and 
across the rocky ride and to 
the upper reaches of the glacier. 
A dull red glow moved down the 
route he and John Drinkard had 
recently taken. Keen eyes could 
readily see that it had the shape 
of a man. 

“That is Dzorr,” said Dzell. 
“We grew in the same membrane. 
He is erasing our trail across the 
ice, John Drinkard.” 

Drinkard watched the glow 
until it slowly faded. “Very 
smart. We can tell tales, but there 
won’t be any proof, eh?” 

“That is correct,” said the 
strange man. He turned to Chuck 
Evers. “You wonder about the 
statement that we grew in the 
same membrane. I should have 
said that we are twins.” 

Evers caught his breath. 
“Telepathy,” he breathed. “John 
wasn’t out of his head.” 

The chill night wind rippled 
across the alpine field. The little 
fire flickered and glowed. Over- 



head, the stars were blue and red 
and yellow ice. 

“The truth is simple,” said the 
man called Dzell. “We have told 
it before, but no one believed, 
and it has not seemed wise to 
support our facts. We, Dzorr and 
I, with our companions Dzinn 
and Dzett, are explorers.” 

John Drinkard slapped his 
hand against the boulder beside 
him and seemed reassured by its 
solidity. He shook his head to 
clear it. 

“I don’t get it,” he objected. 
“Chuck and I could call ourselves 
explorers, too, if rambling around 
the mountains every chance we 
get falls under that heading.” 
“We do not explore the moun- 
tains,” said Dzell. “Here we rest 
and allow ourselves to behave 
normally. We explore in the 
towns and in the cities, where 
people gather. It is strenuous,” he 
added, with a sound almost like 
a sigh. “We cannot tolerate it for 
long. Then we must go into seclu- 
sion and renew ourselves.” 

Keen interest was replacing 
puzzlement in both Evers and 
Drinkard. They smiled now and 
Chuck said: “I know what you 
mean. Ten days in Denver — a 
fine town, mind you — and I feel 
like I’d been staked with a short 
rope.” 

“You do not exactly know 
what I mean,” said Dzell. “Your 
problems are simply matters of 



THE LIGHTS ON PRECIPICE PEAK 



12T 



preference. Ours are physiologi- 
cal. We cannot long maintain 
metabolic balance in the com- 
pany of people. Thus, Dzinn and 
Dzett are now in the world you 
inhabit. When they must rest, 
then our turn comes.” 

T4 ZELL HAD gathered a pile 
of small flat stones and he 
sat sorting them with his gaunt- 
leted fingers. They were simply 
flakes of weathering gneiss, fire- 
and pressure-derived from some 
granite as ancient as the range. 
Neither man noticed the idle 
movements until Dzell raised a 
piece to his mouth and bit into 
it with a grinding sound, like a 
man cracking nuts. His teeth 
were large and square, and they 
had a metallic gleam. They made 
short work of the gneiss. Dzell 
flexed his fingers, selected an- 
other piece of the rock. 

“Among people,” he observed, 
“this would be conspicuous. You 
are not adapted to get oxygen 
from quartz. We are.” 

“You make Houdini look like 
a piker,” big John told him ad- 
miringly. “I admit that’s tougher 
cereal than I’d want to try. But 
the point of the gag still escapes 
me.” 

“I am aware of that,” said the 
strange man. “You cannot com- 
prehend because your mind is 
shackled. Yet it must be evident 
that we are not too much alike.” 

122 



He rose to his feet. 

“There is the matter of the 
body glow. I can control my body 
temperature, raising and lower- 
ing it as I choose. The greatest 
difficulty when I am among peo- 
ple is to keep it down to human 
body heat. Normally it is very 
much higher than yours. And 
when, due to exercise and meta- 
bolic speed-up, excess energy is 
accumulated, it is satisfying to us 
to radiate it. You get the same 
release by deep sighs, by long 
breaths, by stretching your limbs. 
Unfortunately, when we radiate 
rapidly in air, we glow. It has 
made us conspicuous.” 

“We all have our hobbies,” 
said Evers, shifting his swollen 
ankle and wincing. “Did you ever 
hear of the Liars’ Club? If you 
like to hold office, you could be 
President.” 

Dzell did not appear offended. 
“I said you would not believe. 
When it is again my turn to ex- 
plore, I will search for your Liars’ 
Club. I can see from your 
thoughts that it is concerned with 
jokes. And this is the one thing 
about you that we have not mas- 
tered. Other explorers have also 
felt baffled. The function of odd 
misstatement escapes us.” 

“ ‘Other explorers’?” Evers’ 
voice lost its note of ridicule, and 
Drinkard leaned forward with 
new interest. “You mean there 
are a lot of incandescent guys 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



like you prowling about?” 

Dzell shrugged. “All are not 
from my environment. Many are 
so unlike you that they cannot 
mingle and so must observe from 
hiding. Others cannot exist in 
your atmosphere without artifi- 
cial help. We contact them con- 
stantly. Your unawareness is a 
marvel to us all. For creatures 
so well supplied with adaptations 
for sensation, you are indeed 
blind.” 

C HUCK EVERS drew a long 
breath. “If I could radiate, I’d 
be lit up like a theater marquee. 
You sound like an old professor 
I had once. I didn’t understand 
him, either.” 

Had Dzell comprehended hu- 
mor, he would have smiled. But 
he simply turned away with fin- 
ality. 

“Dzorr is waiting by the gla- 
cier,” he said. “We have plans for 
this time. When you return to 
the settlements below, it would 
perhaps be wisest not to attempt 
to explain the lights.” 

The next instant, he was gone 
without a sound. 

The two young men sat silent- 
ly by the dying fire. A few min- 
utes later, both looked up, as 
though by signal, toward the up- 
per reaches of the glacier. Two 
glowing spots, dull cherry red, 
moved steadily across the ice. 
They were visible for brief min- 



utes, then slowly faded. 

Chuck Evers shifted restlessly. 
He shook his head as though a 
bee were buzzing inside it. 

“Did you hear something?” he 
asked. 

“Not with my ears,” said 
Drinkard. “But as plain as a 
voice, Dzell just said to my brain 
‘Good luck, boys!’ in good Ameri- 
can.” 

“Now I know I’m nuts,” grunt- 
ed Chuck Evers. “That’s what he 
said to me.” 

To descend Precipice Peak, 
even if only from Bighorn Gla- 
cier, is no fit task for a cripple. 
Still, Evers and Drinkard knew 
it had to be done, so, in the early 
morning, they set about it with- 
out haste and without complaint. 

Where the going allowed it, 
big John simply back-packed 
Evers. They made use of every 
ledge, for Chuck could rappel 
himself down spots he could - not 
climb or be carried. Both were 
mountain men and tough, but by 
mid-afternoon they knew they 
had had enough. 

So nothing had ever looked 
better than the cheerful figure of 
Heine Kolb, slouched in the sad- 
dle of his dainty-footed pinto 
mare, and leading two pack 
horses loaded with fish panniers. 
The ranger was headed down. 

“The complete Samaritan, 
that’s me,” said Heine. “I haul 
fish up and Poor Fish down. Two 



THE LIGHTS ON PRECIPICE PEAK 



123 



loads for the price of one.” 

“We will accept your insults 
along with the ride,” Chuck 
Evers said wearily. “I never knew 
what a pretty thing a horse could 
be!” 

Heine dropped his fish cans, 
helped to hoist Evers onto one 
of the pack horses. Drinkard 
climbed aboard the other. 

“What happened?” asked the 
ranger. “I saw by the head- 
quarters record that you were 
going up.” 

Evers shrugged and John 
Drinkard said, “The boy here was 
playing rockchuck on the stretch 
below the glacier and one rolled 
with him.” Evers grinned wryly, 
and John added, “It could hap- 
pen to anybody, but it’s the kind 
of thing that’s partial to tender- 
feet.” 

“Next time,” said Evers humb- 
ly, “just leave me up there. I- 
ain’t worth saving.” 

They stopped only once. At 
the big switchback, John Drink- 
ard swung from his horse, pried 
up a stone, tossed the tobacco 
can to Evers without a word. The 
ranger only raised his eyebrows. 

T> ACK AT their tent camp on 
the lake shore, Evers and 
Drinkard were not disturbed by 
questions. When men fail on the 
peaks, they tell their own stories 
in their own time. Chuck’s ankle 
showed quick improvement and 



in a couple of days he was hob- 
bling about. Only young Royston 
came to visit. 

“You have not been back to 
the Lodge,” he said. “Perhaps 
you are afraid to show your 
faces?” 

“People talk your arm off up 
there,” said Drinkard. He grinned 
at the pale young man. “Not 
many of ’em have the gall to 
come snooping down here!” 

Royston sat composedly on a 
boulder. “You cannot offend me. 
I was concerned for you, I was 
interested, so I came. Did you 
see the lights?” 

“Nary a light,” said Chuck 
cheerfully. He sat in a canvas 
chair with his foot propped up. 
“I told you they wouldn’t show 
when anybody was up there.” 

Drinkard turned on him. “You 
collected five bucks from me by 
being on the other side of the 
fence. You were the man who 
was sure there would be some 
sign.” 

Royston looked at them with 
pale eyes. 

“You are both muddling the 
watets. And you are both lying. 
There were lights on the peak 
when you were there and I have 
a feeling you saw them. They 
were quite a show from here.” 

“Then this is the place to see 
them from,” said Chuck. “Closer 
up, you lose perspective.” 

Royston rose from his seat on 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the rock. “Friendship means noth- 
ing to you, so I will take my 
small hike back to the Lodge 
again. Actually, I came to say 
that tomorrow I leave this miser- 
able place and go home. I have 
endured all the health I can 
stand.” 

“Now that,” said Chuck, “is a 
different story. We’re sorry to see 
you go, fella.” 

“Our regards to the swamps,” 
John Drinkard put in. “Ten to 
one, when you get there, you’ll 
wish you were back.” 

Carl Royston showed his big 
teeth in a mirthless smile. 

“This,” he said, “I very much 
doubt.” 

They watched him go around 
the turn in the trail. Then Drink- 
ard took two strides to the rock 
where Royston had sat. He 
touched a finger tentatively to 
the stone and snatched it away. 

“I thought so,” he said. “He 
really liked us, but this time he 
was careful not to shake hands. 
In spite of himself, he has 
reached his limit of control. His 
temperature is going up.” 

Evers looked on with puzzled 
eyes. 



“He never could see a joke and 
he’d wait to pick our brains for 
a new word,” Drinkard pointed 
out. 

“Royston — ” 

“ — is a name out of a hat,” 
said John Drinkard. “When that 
lad really goes home, he’ll go 
with his buddies up there on the 
peak. I wonder which he is — 
Dzinn or Dzett.”

The Game of 

Rat and Dragon 

By CORDWAINER SMITH 

Only partners could fight this deadliest of 
wars — and the one way to dissolve the 
partnership was to be personally dissolved! 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE TABLE 

P INLIGHTING is a hell of 
a way to earn a living. 
Underhill was furious as 
he closed the door behind him- 
self. It didn’t make much sense 
to wear a uniform and look like 
a soldier if people didn’t appre- 
ciate what you did. 

He sat down in his chair, laid 
his head back in the headrest 
and pulled the helmet down over 
his forehead. 

As he waited for the pin-set to 
warm up, he remembered the 



girl in the outer corridor. She had 
looked at it, then looked at him 
scornfully. 

“Meow.” That was all she had 
said. Yet it had cut him like a 
knife. 

What did she think he was — 
a fool, a loafer, a uniformed non- 
entity? Didn’t she know that for 
every half hour of pinlighting, he 
got a minimum of two months’ 
recuperation in the hospital? 

By now the set was warm. He 
felt the squares of space around 
him, sensed himself at the mid- 
dle of an immense grid, a cubic 



THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON 



127 



grid, full of nothing. Out in that 
nothingness, he could sense the 
hollow aching horror of space it- 
self and could feel the terrible 
anxiety which his mind encoun- 
tered whenever it met the faint- 
est trace of inert dust. 

As he relaxed, the comforting 
solidity of the Sun, the clock- 
work of the familiar planets and 
the Moon rang in on him. Our 
own solar system was as charm- 
ing and as simple as an ancient 
cuckoo clock filled with familiar 
ticking and with reassuring noises. 
The odd little moons of Mars 
swung around their planet like 
frantic mice, yet their regularity 
was itself an assurance that all 
was well. Far above the plane of 
the ecliptic, he could feel half 
a ton of dust more or less drifting 
outside the lanes of human travel. 

Here there was nothing to 
fight, nothing to challenge the 
mind, to tear the living soul out 
of a body with its roots dripping 
in effluvium as tangible as blood. 

Nothing ever moved in on the 
Solar System. He could wear the 
pin-set forever and be nothing 
more than a sort of telepathic 
astronomer, a man who could 
feel the hot, warm protection of 
the Sun throbbing and burning 
against his living mind. 

W OODLEY came in. 

“Same old ticking world,” 
said Underhill. “Nothing to re- 

128 



port. No wonder they didn’t de- 
velop the pin-set until they began 
to planoform. Down here with 
the hot Sun around us, it feels so 
good and so quiet. You can feel 
everything spinning and turning. 
It’s nice and sharp and compact. 
It’s sort of like sitting around 
home.” 

Woodley grunted. He was not 
much given to flights of fantasy. 

Undeterred, Underhill went on, 
“It must have been pretty good 
to have been an Ancient Man. I 
wonder why they burned up their 
world with war. They didn’t have 
to planoform. They didn’t have 
to go out to earn their livings 
among the stars. They didn’t have 
to dodge the Rats or play the 
Game. They couldn’t have in- 
vented pinlighting because they 
didn’t have any need of it, did 
they, Woodley?” 

Woodley grunted, “Uh-huh.” 
Woodley was twenty-six years 
old and due to retire in one more 
year. He already had a farm 
picked out. He had gotten 
through ten years of hard work 
pinlighting with the best of them. 
He had kept his sanity by not 
thinking very much about his 
job, meeting the strains of the 
task whenever he had to meet 
them and thinking nothing more 
about his duties until the next 
emergency arose. 

Woodley never made a point 
of getting popular among the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Partners. None of the Partners 
liked him very much. Some of 
them even resented him. He was 
suspected of thinking ugly 
thoughts of the Partners on occa- 
sion, but since none of the Part- 
ners ever thought a complaint in 
articulate form, the other pin- 
lighters and the Chiefs of the 
Instrumentality left him alone. 

Underhill was still full of the 
wonder of their job. Happily he 
babbled on, “What does happen 
to us when we planoform? Do 
you think it’s sort of like dying? 
Did you ever see anybody who 
had his soul pulled out?” 

“Pulling souls is just a way of 
talking about it,” said Woodley. 
“After all these years, nobody 
knows whether we have souls or 
not.” 

“But I saw one once. I saw 
what Dogwood looked like when 
he came apart. There was some- 
thing funny. It looked wet and 
sort of sticky as if it were bleed- 
ing and it went out of him — and 
you know what they did to Dog- 
wood? They took him away, up 
in that part of the hospital where 
you and I never go — way up at 
the top part where the others are, 
where the others always have to 
go if they are alive after the Rats 
of the Up-and-Out have gotten 
them.” 

Woodley sat down and lit an 
ancient pipe. He was burning 
something called tobacco in it. 



It was a dirty sort of habit, but 
it made him look very dashing 
and adventurous. 

“Look here, youngster. You 
don’t have to worry about that 
stuff. Pinlighting is getting better 
all the time. The Partners are 
getting better. I’ve seen them pin- 
light two Rats forty-six million 
miles apart in one and a half 
milliseconds. As long as people 
had to try to work the pin-sets 
themselves, there was always the 
chance that with a minimum of 
four hundred milliseconds for the 
human mind to set a pinlight, we 
wouldn’t light the Rats up fast 
enough to protect our pianoform- 
ing ships. The Partners have 
changed all that. Once they get 
going, they’re faster than Rats. 
And they always will be. I know 
it’s not easy, letting a Partner 
share your mind — ” 

“It’s not easy for them, either,” 
said Underhill. 

“Don’t worry about them. 
They’re not human. Let them 
take care of themselves. I’ve seen 
more pinlighters go crazy from 
monkeying around with Partners 
than I have ever seen caught by 
the Rats. How many do you actu- 
ally know of them that got grab- 
bed by Rats?” 

T T NDERHILL looked down at 
his fingers, which shone green 
and purple in the vivid light 
thrown by the tuned-in pin-set, 



THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON

and counted ships. The thumb 
for the Andromeda, lost with crew 
and passengers, the index finger 
and the middle finger for Release 
Ships 43 and 56, found with 
their pin-sets burned out and 
every man, woman, and child on 
board dead or insane. The ring 
finger, the little finger, and the 
thumb of the other hand were 
the first three battleships to be 
lost to the Rats — lost as people 
realized that there was something 
out there underneath space it- 
self which was alive, capricious 
and malevolent. 

Pianoforming was sort of 
funny. It felt like — 

Like nothing much. 

Like the twinge of a mild elec- 
tric shock. 

Like the ache of a sore tooth 
bitten on for the first time. 

Like a slightly painful flash of 
light against the eyes. 

Yet in that time, a forty-thou- 
sand-ton ship lifting free above 
Earth disappeared somehow or 
other into two dimensions and 
appeared half a light-year or 
fifty light-years off. 

At one moment, he would be 
sitting in the Fighting Room, the 
pin-set ready and the familiar 
Solar System ticking around in- 
side his head. For a second or a 
year (he could never tell how 
long it really was, subjectively), 
the funny little flash went through 
him and then he was loose in the 

130 



Up-and-Out, the terrible open 
spaces between the stars, where 
the stars themselves felt like pim- 
ples on his telepathic mind and 
the planets were too far away to 
be sensed or read. 

Somewhere in this outer space, 
a gruesome death awaited, death 
and horror of a kind which Man 
had never encountered until he 
reached out for interstellar space 
itself. Apparently the light of the 
suns kept the Dragons away. 

T'kRAGONS. That was what 
people called them. To ordi- 
nary people, there was nothing, 
nothing except the shiver of pian- 
oforming and the hammer blow 
of sudden death or the dark spas- 
tic note of lunacy descending into 
their minds. 

But to the telepaths, they were 
Dragons. 

In the fraction of a second be- 
tween the telepaths’ awareness of 
a hostile something out in the 
black, hollow nothingness of 
space and the impact of a fero- 
cious, ruinous psychic blow 
against all living things within 
the ship, the telepaths had sensed 
entities something like the 
Dragons of ancient human lore, 
beasts more clever than beasts, 
demons more tangible than de- 
mons, hungry vortices of alive- 
ness and hate compounded by 
unknown means out of the thin 
tenuous matter between the stars. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It took a surviving ship to 
bring back the news — a ship in 
which, by sheer chance, a tele- 
path had a light beam ready, 
turning it out at the innocent dust 
so that, within the panorama of 
his mind, the Dragon dissolved 
into nothing at all and the other 
passengers, themselves non-tele- 
pathic, went about their way not 
realizing that their own immedi- 
ate deaths had been averted. 

From then on, it was easy — 
almost. 

T3LANOFQRMING ships al- 
ways carried telepaths. Tele- 
paths had their sensitiveness 
enlarged to an immense range by 
the pin-sets, which were tele- 
pathic amplifiers adapted to the 
mammal mind. The pin-sets in 
turn were electronically geared 
into small dirigible light bombs. 
Light did it. 

Light broke up the Dragons, 
allowed the ships to reform three- 
dimensionally, skip, skip, skip, as 
they moved from star to star. 

The odds suddenly moved 
down from a hundred to one 
against mankind to sixty to forty 
in mankind’s favor. 

This was not enough. The tele- 
paths were trained to become 
ultrasensitive, trained to become 
aware of the Dragons in less than 
a millisecond. 

But it was found that the 
Dragons could move a million 



miles in just under two milli- 
seconds and that this was not 
enough for the human mind to 
activate the light beams. 

Attempts had been made to 
sheath the ships in light at all 
times. 

This defense wore out. 

As mankind learned about the 
Dragons, so too, apparently, the 
Dragons learned about mankind. 
Somehow they flattened their 
own bulk and came in on ex- 
tremely flat trajectories very 
quickly. 

Intense light was needed, light 
of sunlike intensity. This could 
be provided only by light bombs. 
Pinlighting came into existence. 

Pinlighting consisted of the de- 
tonation of ultra-vivid miniature 
photonuclear bombs, which con- 
verted a few ounces of a mag- 
nesium isotope into pure visible 
radiance. 

The odds kept coming down 
in mankind’s favor, yet ships were 
being lost. 

It became so bad that people 
didn’t even want to find the ships 
because the rescuers knew what 
they would see. It was sad to 
bring back to Earth three hun- 
dred bodies ready for burial and 
two hundred or three hundred 
lunatics, damaged beyond repair, 
to be wakened, and fed, and 
cleaned, and put to sleep, wak- 
ened and fed again until their 
lives were ended. 



THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON

r 1 1 ELEPATHS tried to reach 
into the minds of the psy- 
chotics who had been damaged 
"by the Dragons, but they found 
nothing there beyond vivid spout- 
ing columns of fiery terror burst- 
ing from the primordial id itself, 
the volcanic source of life. 

Then came the Partners. 

Man and Partner could do to- 
gether what Man could not do 
alone. Men had the intellect. 
Partners had the speed. 

The Partners rode their tiny 
craft, no larger than footballs, 
outside the spaceships. They 
planoformed with the ships. They 
rode beside them in their six- 
pound craft ready to attack. 

The tiny ships of the Partners 
were swift. Each carried a dozen 



pinlights, bombs no bigger than 
thimbles. 

The pinlighters threw the Part- 
ners — quite literally threw — 
by means of mind-to-firing relays 
direct at the Dragons. 

What seemed to be Dragons 
to the human mind appeared in 
the form of gigantic Rats in the 
minds of the Partners. 

Out in the pitiless nothingness 
of space, the Partners’ minds re- 
sponded to an instinct as old as 
life. The Partners attacked, strik- 
ing with a speed faster than 
Man’s, going from attack to at- 
tack until the Rats or themselves 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



were destroyed. Almost all the 
time, it was the Partners who 
won. 

With the safety of the inter- 
stellar skip, skip, skip of the 
ships, commerce increased im- 
mensely, the population of all the 
colonies went up, and the demand 
for trained Partners increased. 

Underhill and Woodley were 
a part of the third generation of 
pinlighters and yet, to them, it 
seemed as though their craft had 
endured forever. 

Gearing space into minds by 
means of the pin-set, adding the 
Partners to those minds, keying 
up the mind for the tension of a 




fight on which all depended — 
this was more than human syn- 
apses could stand for long. Under- 
hill needed his two months’ rest 
after half an hour of fighting. 
Woodley needed his retirement 
after ten years of service. They 
were young. They were good. 
But they had limitations. 

So much depended on the 
choice of Partners, so much on 
the sheer luck of who drew whom. 

THE SHUFFLE 

F ATHER Moontree and the 
little girl named West en- 
tered the room. They were the 
other two pinlighters. The hu- 
man complement of the Fighting 
Room was now complete. 

Father Moontree was a red- 




THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON 



133 



faced man of forty-five who had 
lived the peaceful life" of a farmer 
until he reached his fortieth year. 
Only then, belatedly, did the 
authorities find he was telepathic 
and agree to let him late in life 
enter upon the career of pin- 
lighter. He did well at it, but he 
was fantastically old for this kind 
of business. 

Father Moontree looked at the 
glum Woodley and the musing 
Underhill. “How’re the young- 
sters today? Ready for a good 
fight?” 

“Father always wants a fight,” 
giggled the little girl named West. 
She was such a little little girl. 
Her giggle was high and childish. 
She looked like the last person 
in the world one would expect 
to find in the rough, sharp dueling 
of pinlighting. 

Underhill had been amused 
one time when he found one of 
the most sluggish of the Partners 
coming away happy from con- 
tact with the mind of the girl 
named West. 

Usually the Partners didn’t 
care much about the human 
minds with which they were 
paired for the journey. The Part- 
ners seemed to take the attitude 
that human minds were complex 
and fouled up beyond belief, any- 
how. No Partner ever questioned 
the superiority of the human 
mind, though very few of the 
Partners were much impressed 

134 



by that superiority. 

The Partners liked people. 
They were willing to fight with 
them. They were even willing to 
die for them. But when a Partner 
liked an individual the way, for 
example, that Captain Wow or 
the Lady May liked Underhill, 
the liking had nothing to do with 
intellect. It was a matter of tem- 
perament, of feel. 

Underhill knew perfectly well 
that Captain Wow regarded his, 
Underhill’s, brains as silly. What 
Captain Wow liked was Under- 
hill’s friendly emotional structure, 
the cheerfulness and glint of 
wicked amusement that shot 
through ■'-Underhill’s unconscious 
thought patterns, and the gaiety 
with which Underhill faced dan- 
ger. The words, the history books, 
the ideas, the science — Under- 
hill could sense all that in his 
own mind, reflected back from 
Captain Wow’s mind, as so much 
rubbish. 

Miss West looked at Underhill. 
“I bet you’ve put stickum on the 
stones.” 

“I did not!” 

Underhill felt his ears grow red 
with embarrassment. During his 
novitiate, he had tried to cheat 
in the lottery because he got par- 
ticularly fond of a special Part- 
ner, a lovely young mother named 
Murr. It was so much easier to 
operate with Murr and she was 
so affectionate toward him that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he forgot pinlighting was hard 
work and that he was not in- 
structed to have a good time with 
his Partner. They were both de- 
signed and prepared to go into 
deadly battle together. 

One cheating had been enough. 
They had found him out and he 
had been laughed at for years. 

Father Moon tree picked up 
the imitation-leather cup and 
shook the stone dice which as- 
signed them their Partners for 
the trip. By senior rights, he took 
first draw. 

H E GRIMACED. He had 
drawn a greedy old charac- 
ter, a tough old male whose mind 
was full of slobbering thoughts of 
food, veritable oceans full of half- 
spoiled fish. Father Moontree had 
once said that he burped cod liver 
oil for weeks after drawing that 
particular glutton, so strongly had 
the telepathic image of fish im- 
pressed itself upon his mind. Yet 
the glutton was a glutton for dan- 
ger as well as for fish. He had 
killed sixty-three Dragons, more 
than any other Partner in the 
service, and was quite literally 
worth his weight in gold. 

The little girl West came next. 
She drew Captain Wow. When 
she saw who it was, she smiled. 

“I like him,” she said. “He’s 
such fun to fight with. He feels 
so nice and cuddly in my mind.” 
“Cuddly, hell,” said Woodley. 



“I’ve been in his mind, too. It’s 
the most leering mind in this ship, 
bar none.” 

“Nasty man,” said the little 
girl. She said it declaratively, 
without reproach. 

Underhill, looking at her, shiv- 
ered. 

He didn’t see how she could 
take Captain Wow so calmly. 
Captain Wow’s mind did leer. 
When Captain Wow got excited 
in the middle of a battle, con- 
fused images of Dragons, deadly 
Rats, luscious beds, the smell of 
fish, and the shock of space all 
scrambled together in his mind 
as he and Captain Wow, their 
consciousnesses linked together 
through the pin-set, became a 
fantastic composite of human 
being and Persian cat. 

That’s the trouble with work- 
ing with cats, thought Underhill. 
It’s a pity that nothing else any- 
where will serve as Partner. Cats 
were all right once you got in 
touch with them telepathically. 
They were smart enough to meet 
the needs of the fight, but their 
motives and desires were cer- 
tainly different from those of 
humans. 

They were companionable 
enough as long as you thought 
tangible images at them, but their 
minds just closed up and went to 
sleep when you recited Shake- 
speare or Colegrove, or if you 
tried to tell them what space was. 



THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON 



135 



It was sort of funny realizing 
that the Partners who were so 
grim and mature out here in 
space were the same cute little 
animals that people had used as 
pets for thousands of years back 
on Earth. He had embarrassed 
himself more than once while on 
the ground saluting perfectly 
ordinary non-telepathic cats be- 
cause he had forgotten for the 
moment that they were not Part- 
ners. 

He picked up the cup and 
shook out his stone dice. 

He was lucky — he drew the 
Lady May. 

T HE LADY MAY was the 
most thoughtful Partner he 
had ever met. In her, the finely 
bred pedigree mind of a Persian 
cat had reached one of its high- 
est peaks of development. She 
was more complex than any hu- 
man woman, but the complexity 
was all one of emotions, memory, 
hope and discriminated experi- 
ence — experience sorted through 
without benefit of words. 

When he had first come into 
contact with her mind, he was 
astonished at its clarity. With her 
he remembered her kittenhood. 
He remembered every mating 
experience she had ever had. He 
saw in a half-recognizable gallery 
all the other pinlighters with 
whom she had been paired for 
the fight. And he' saw himself 



radiant, cheerful and desirable. 

He even thought he caught the 
edge of a longing — 

A very flattering and yearning 
thought: What a pity he is not 
a cat. 

Woodley picked up the last 
stone. He drew what he deserved 
— a sullen, scared old tomcat 
with none of the verve of Cap- 
tain Wow. Woodley’s Partner was 
the most animal of all the cats 
on the ship, a low, brutish type 
with a dull mind. Even telepathy 
had not refined his character. His 
ears were half chewed off from 
the first fights in which he had 
engaged. 

He was a serviceable fighter, 
nothing more. 

Woodley grunted. 

Underhill glanced at him odd- 
ly. Didn’t Woodley ever do any- 
thing but grunt? 

Father Moontree looked at the 
other three. “You might as well 
get your Partners now. I’ll let 
the Scanner know we’re ready to 
go into the Up-and-Out.” 

THE DEAL 

U NDERHILL spun the com- 
bination lock on the Lady 
May’s cage. He woke her gently 
and took her into his arms. She 
humped her back luxuriously, 
stretched her claws, started to 
purr, thought better of it, and 
licked him on the wrist instead. 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He did not have the pin-set on, 
so their minds were closed to 
each other, but in the angle of 
her mustache and in the move- 
ment of her ears, he caught some 
sense of gratification she experi- 
enced in finding him as her 
Partner. 

He talked to her in human 
speech, even though speech 
meant nothing to a cat when the 
pin-set was not on. 

“It’s a damn shame, sending 
a sweet little thing like you whirl- 
ing around in the coldness of 
nothing to hunt for Rats that are 
bigger and deadlier than all of 
us put together. You didn’t ask 
for this kind of fight, did you?” 

For answer, she licked his 
hand, purred, tickled his cheek 
with her long fluffy tail, turned 
around and faced him, golden 
eyes shining. 

For a moment, they stared at 
each other, man squatting, cat 
standing erect on her hind legs, 
front claws digging into his knee. 
Human eyes and cat eyes looked 
across an immensity which no 
words could meet, but which af- 
fection spanned in a single glance. 

“Time to get in,” he said. 

She walked docilely into her 
spheroid carrier. She climbed in. 
He saw to it that her miniature 
pin-set rested firmly and com- 
fortably against the base of her 
brain. He made sure that her 
claws were padded so that she 



could not tear herself in the ex- 
citement of battle. 

Softly he said to her, “Ready?” 

For answer, she preened her 
back as much as her harness 
would permit and purred softly 
within the confines of the frame 
that held her. 

He slapped down the lid and 
watched the sealant ooze around 
the seam. For a few hours, she 
was welded into her projectile 
until a workman with a short 
cutting arc would remove her 
after she had done her duty. 

TIE PICKED up the entire pro- 
jectile and slipped it into 
the ejection tube. He closed the 
door of the tube, spun the lock, 
seated himself in his chair, and 
put his own pin-set on. 

Once again he flung the switch. 

He sat in a small room, small, 
small, warm, warm, the bodies of 
the other three people moving 
close around him, the tangible 
lights in the ceiling bright and 
heavy against his closed eyelids. 

As the pin-set warmed, the 
room fell away. The other people 
ceased to be people and became 
small glowing heaps of fire, em- 
bers, dark red fire, with the con- 
sciousness of life burning like old 
red coals in a country fireplace. 

As the pin-set warmed a little 
more, he felt Earth just below 
him, felt the ship slipping away, 
felt the turning Moon as it swung 



THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON 



137 



THE PLAY 



on the far side of the world, felt 
the planets and the hot, clear 
goodness of the Sun which kept 
the Dragons so far from man- 
kind’s native ground. 

Finally, he reached complete 
awareness. 

He was telepathically alive to 
a range of millions of miles. He 
felt the dust which he had noticed 
earlier high above the ecliptic. 
With a thrill of warmth and ten- 
derness, he felt the consciousness 
of the Lady May pouring over 
into his own. Her consciousness 
was as gentle and clear and yet 
sharp to the taste of his mind as 
if it were scented oil. It felt re- 
laxing and reassuring. He could 
sense her welcome of him. It was 
scarcely a thought, just a raw 
emotion of greeting. 

At last they were one again. 

In a tiny remote corner of his 
mind, as tiny as the smallest toy 
he had ever seen in his childhood, 
he was still aware of the room 
and the ship, and of Father Moon- 
tree picking up a telephone and 
speaking to a Scanner captain in 
charge of the ship. 

His telepathic mind caught the 
idea long before his ears could 
frame the words. The actual 
sound followed the idea the way 
that thunder on an ocean beach 
follows the lightning inward from 
far out over the seas. 

“The Fighting Room is ready. 
Clear to planoform, sir.” 



U NDERHILL was always a 
little exasperated the way 
that Lady May experienced 
things before he did. 

He was braced for the quick 
vinegar thrill of pianoforming, 
but he caught her report of it 
before his own nerves could 
register what happened. 

Earth had fallen so far away 
that he groped for several milli- 
seconds before he found the Sun 
in the upper rear right-hand 
corner of his telepathic mind. 

That was a good jump, he 
thought. This way we’ll get there 
in four or five skips. 

A few hundred miles outside 
the ship, the Lady May thought 
back at him, “O warm, O gener- 
ous, O gigantic man! O brave, O 
friendly, O tender and huge Part- 
ner! O wonderful with you, with 
you so good, good, good, warm, 
warm, now to fight, now to go, 
good with you. 

He knew that she was not 
thinking words, that his mind 
took the clear amiable babble of 
her cat intellect and translated it 
into images which his own think- 
ing could record and understand. 

Neither one of them was ab- 
sorbed in the game of mutual 
greetings. He reached out far be- 
yond her range of perception to 
see if there was anything near 
the ship. It was funny how it was 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



possible to do two things at once. 
He could scan space with his pin- 
set mind and yet at the same 
time catch a vagrant thought of 
hers, a lovely, affectionate 
thought about a son who had had 
a golden face and a chest covered 
with soft, incredibly downy white 
fur. 

While he was still searching, 
he caught the warning from her. 

We jump again! 

And so they had. The ship had 
moved to a second planoform. 
The stars were different. The Sun 
was immeasurably far behind. 
Even the nearest stars were bare- 
ly in contact. This was good 
Dragon country, this open, nasty, 
hollow kind of space. He reached 
farther, faster, sensing and look- 
ing for danger, ready to fling the 
Lady May at danger wherever 
he found it. 

Terror blazed up in his mind, 
so sharp, so clear, that it came 
through as a physical wrench. 

The little girl named West had 
found something — something 
immense, long, black, sharp, 
greedy, horrific. She flung Cap- 
tain Wow at it. 

Underhill tried to keep his own 
mind clear. “Watch out!” he 
shouted telepathically at the 
others, trying to move the Lady 
May around. 

At one corner of the battle, he 
felt the lustful rage of Captain 
Wow as the big Persian tomcat 



detonated lights while he ap- 
proached the streak of dust which 
threatened the ship and the peo- 
ple within. 

The lights scored near-misses. 

The dust flattened itself, 
changing from the shape of a 
sting-ray into the shape of a 
spear. 

Not three milliseconds had 
elapsed. 

T^ATHER Moontree was talk- 
ing human words and was 
saying in a voice that moved like 
cold molasses out of a heavy jar, 
“C - A - P - T - A - I - N.” Under- 
hill knew that the sentence was 
going to be “Captain, move fast!” 

The battle would be fought 
and finished before Father Moon- 
tree got through talking. 

Now, fractions of a millisecond 
later, the Lady May was directly 
in line. 

Here was where the skill and 
speed of the Partners came in. 
She could react faster than he. 
She could see the threat as an 
immense Rat coming direct at 
her. 

She could fire the light- 
bombs with a discrimination 
which he might miss. 

He was connected with her 
mind, but he could not follow it. 

His consciousness absorbed the 
tearing wound inflicted by the 
alien enemy. It was like no 
wound on Earth — raw, crazy 



THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON 



139 




pain which started like a burn at 
his navel. He began to writhe in 
his chair. 

Actually he had not yet had 
time to move a muscle when the 
Lady May struck back at their 
enemy. 

Five evenly spaced photonu- 
clear bombs blazed out across a 
hundred thousand miles. 

The pain in his mind and body 
vanished. 

He felt a moment of fierce, 
terrible, feral elation running 



through the mind of the Lady 
May as she finished her kill. It 
was always disappointing to the 
cats to find out that their ene- 
mies whom they sensed as gigan- 
tic space Rats disappeared at the 
moment of destruction. 

Then he felt her hurt, the pain 
and the fear that swept over both 
of them as the battle, quicker 
than the movement of an eyelid, 
had come and gone. In the same

instant, there came the sharp and 
acid twinge of planoform. 

Once more the ship went skip. 

He could hear Woodley think- 
ing at him. “You don’t have to 
bother much. This old son of a 
gun and I will take over for a 
while.” 

Twice again the twinge, the 
skip. 

He had no idea where he was 
until the lights of the Caledonia 
space board shone below. 

With a weariness that lay al- 



most beyond the limits of 
thought, he threw his mind back 
into rapport with the pin-set, fix- 
ing the Lady May’s projectile 
gently and neatly in its launching 
tube. 

She was half dead with 
fatigue, but he could feel the beat 
of her heart, could listen to her 
panting, and he grasped the grate- 
ful edge of a thanks reaching 
from her mind to his.

THE SCORE 

HP HEY PUT him in the hospi- 
tal at Caledonia. 

The doctor was friendly but 
firm. “You actually got touched 
by that Dragon. That’s as close 
a shave as I’ve ever seen. It’s all 
so quick that it’ll be a long time 
before we know what happened 
scientifically, but I suppose you’d 
be ready for the insane asylum 
now if the contact had lasted 
several tenths of a millisecond 
longer. What kind of cat did you 
have out in front of you?” 

Underhill felt the words com- 
ing out of him slowly. Words 
were such a lot of trouble com- 
pared with the speed and the 
joy of thinking, fast and sharp 
and clear, mind to mind! But 
words were all that could reach 
ordinary people like this doctor. 

His mouth moved heavily as 
he articulated words, “Don’t call 
our Partners cats. The right thing 
to call them is Partners. They 
fight for us in a team. You ought 
to know we call them Partners, 
not cats. How is mine?” 

“I don’t know,” said the doctor 
contritely. “We’ll find out for you. 
Meanwhile, old man, you take it 
easy. There’s nothing but rest 
that can help you. Can you make 
yourself sleep, or would you like 
us to give you some kind of 
sedative?” 

“I can sleep,” said Underhill. 



“I just want to know about the 
Lady May.” 

The nurse joined in. She was a 
little antagonistic. “Don’t you 
want to know about the other 
people?” 

“They’re okay,” said Underhill. 
“I knew that before I came in 
here.” 

He stretched his arms and 
sighed and grinned at them. He 
could see they were relaxing and 
were beginning to treat him as a 
person instead of a patient. 

“I’m all right,” he said. “Just 
let me know when I can go see 
my Partner.” 

A new thought struck him. He 
looked wildly at the doctor. 
“They didn’t send her off with 
the ship, did they?” 

“I’ll find out right away,” said 
the doctor. He gave Underhill a 
reassuring squeeze of the shoulder 
and left the room. 

The nurse took a napkin off 
a goblet of chilled fruit juice. 

f T NDERHILL tried to smile at 
her. There seemed to be 
something wrong with the girl. 
He wished she would go away. 
First she had started to be friend- 
ly and now she was distant again. 
It’s a nuisance being telepathic, 
he thought. You keep trying to 
reach even when you are not 
making contact. 

Suddenly she swung around on 
him.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You pinlighters! You and 
your damn cats!” 

Just as she stamped out, he 
burst into her mind. He saw him- 
self a radiant hero, clad in his 
smooth suede uniform, the pin-set 
crown shining like ancient royal 
jewels around his head. He saw 
his own face, handsome and mas- 
culine, shining out of her mind. 
He saw himself very far away 
and he saw himself as she hated 
him. 

She hated him in the secrecy 
of her own mind. She hated him 
because he was — she thought 
— proud, and strange, and rich, 



better and more beautiful than 
people like her. 

He cut off the sight of her mind 
and, as he buried his face in the 
pillow, he caught an image of the 
Lady May. 

“She is a cat,” he thought. 
“That’s all she is — a cat!” 

But that was not how his mind 
saw her — quick beyond all 
dreams of speed, sharp, clever, 
unbelievably graceful, beautiful, 
wordless and undemanding. 

Where would he ever find a 
woman who could compare with 
her?

look at it this way: 

We all know how clever film 
makeup men are — but maybe 
we’ve got a reverse idea of their 
job. Instead of covering wrinkles, 
perhaps they’re putting them in! 

Yes, I’m aware that it’s a 

shocking notion, that this is very 
skimpy data to base it on, that all 
it can be called, actually, is specu- 
lation. Yet what other conclusion 
can be drawn? 

I think I can explain best by 
an imaginary scene in the office 
of Manny Wolverine, head of 
Infinitesimal Films, Inc. He is 

negotiating a new contract with 
Sweetpea Beauregard, whose 
horizontal walk was what made 
wide-screen necessary. 

Manny: (through cigar smoke) 
Well, kiddo, you’re packinm in 

atta box office and that means 

you rate a deal. 

Sweetpea: (squeals) Why, Man- 
ny sugah! Ah could nevah have 
done it without the mahvelous 
help of the cameramen and — 
Manny: For always dollying in 
behind ya? Take the credit, kid- 
do — ya got what every guy 
would like to take. Here (hands 
her contract), take a look at this. 
Sweetpea: (reads, finishes, blinks) 
Why, Manny sugah, this calls for 
less money! 

Manny: More money, kiddo, but 
there’s a special charge. See? 
Right there. 

144 



Sweetpea: (gasps in 3D) You 

— you mean — ? 

Manny: (smugly) Yeah. Now 

what’s more important? 
Sweetpea: This, of cohse! But I 

— I never even suspected! 

Manny: Natch. Nobody does. 
Sweetpea: (still dazzled) But 

when did it all staht? 

Manny: Twenny, twenny-fi years. 
It’s colossally bettern it was then, 
but it was terrific and sensational 
even back there. 

Sweetpea: (blinking thoughtful- 
ly) But what about the ones 
who — ? 

Manny: Oh, them. Big sendoff, 
lotsa publicity — for re-releases, 
see — then pour on the juice 
real hard. A little plastic surgery 
and they’re ready to start over. 
Sweetpea: But — why? 

Manny: Why take chances on 
new ones? Same goes for writers 

— if they know nothing kills a 
film fastern a fresh plot, they get 
this special contract. 

Sweetpea: Oh, Manny sugah, I’m 
so flattered you’re giving it to me! 
Manny: Again, you mean. 
Sweetpea: (blankly) Again? 
Manny: Sure, kiddo. After you 
sign, I’ll show you who you used 
to be. 

Nothing but speculation, I ad- 
mit, but I’ll bet you’ve often 
wondered. And the facts all seem 
to fit. What do you think, kiddo 
or sugar, as the case may be?
