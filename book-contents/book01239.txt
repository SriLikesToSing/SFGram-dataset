LANDING ON HERMES — The Moon's exploratory ship (November IF) has 
effected a safe landing on Hermes. Engineers will probe it for possible valuable 
ores and minerals. Earth is seen in the distance. Spherical or irregular in 
shape, asteroids are supposed to have their origin in the break-ups or ex- 
plosions of larger planets. Earth's chances of being struck by one of the thou- 
sands of asteroids which whirl through our solar system are infinitesimal. 




FREE SAMPLE LESSON 


you’re that man, here’s something that will 
interest you. 

Not a magic formula — not a get-rich-quick 
scheme — but something more substantial, more 
practical. 

Of course, you need something more than just 
the desire to be an accountant. You've got to pay 
the price — be willing to study earnestly, thoroughly. 

Still, wouldn't it be worth your while to sacri- 
fice some of your leisure in favor of interesting 
home study — over a comparatively brief period? 
Always provided that the rewards were good — a 
salary of $4,000 to $10,000? 

An accountant’s duties are interesting, varied 
and of real worth to his employers. He has standing! 

Do you feel that such things aren’t for you? 
Well, don’t be too sure. Very possibly they can be! 

Why not, like so many before you, investigate 
LaSalle’s modern Problem Method of training for 
an accountancy, position? 

Just suppose you were permitted to work in a 
large accounting house under the personal super- 
vision of an expert accountant. Suppose, with his 
aid, you studied accounting principles and solved 
problems day by day — easy ones at first — then 
more difficult ones. If you could do this — and 
could turn to him for advice as the problems be- 
came complex — soon you’d master them all. 

That’s the training you follow in principle un- 
der the LaSalle Problem Method. 

You cover accountancy from the basic Prin- 
ciples right up through Accountancy Systems and 
Income Tax Procedure. Then you add C. P. A. 
Training and prepare for the C. P. A. examina- 
tions. 

As you go along, you absorb the principles of 
Auditing, Cost Accounting, Business Law, Sta- 


tistical Control, Organization, Management and 
Finance. 

Your progress is as speedy as you care to make 
it — depending on your own eagerness to learn 
and the time you spend in study. 

Will recognition come? The only answer, as 
you know, is that success does come to the man 
who is really trained. It’s possible your employers 
will notice your improvement in a very few weeks 
or months. Indeed, many LaSalle graduates have 
paid for their training — with increased earnings 
— before they have completed it! For accountants, 
who are trained in organization and management, 
are the executives of the future.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

NOT SO LONG ago, an AP dis- 
patch from Washington, D.G., re- 
ported that the Federation of 
American Scientists had proposed 
a “six point revision” of govern- 
ment standards regarding security. 
This eminent group of scientists de- 
clared “there is a need for a new 
approach to security” because “loy- 
al people at all levels of responsi- 
bility in the atomic energy program, 
including the commissioners them- 
selves, might well be indicted by the 
same kind of standards as were ap- 
plied to Dr Oppenheimer.” 

One of the six points offered 
was: 

“Although association with a 
large number of reputedly disloyal 
persons might be a ground for a 
finding of disloyalty or flagrant in- 
descretion,” the scientists contended 
that “when a few such associations 
can outweigh all other evidence of 
discretion and loyalty, the security 
system is in danger of becoming 


monstrous.” 

From this it seems that these 
scientists think the ruling was un- 
fair and that loyalty can be diluted. 
In other words, it reads to me like 
you can associate with four or five 
disloyal persons and be subject to 
a mere reprimand, while it would 
require association with thirty or 
forty or fifty disloyal persons to be 
found guilty of complete disloyalty. 

All I know about such top drawer 
operations of the government is 
what I read in the newspapers. But 
from what I have read in the news- 
papers about the Oppenheimer 
case, it seems that the Government 
was fair and just and right in de- 
claring Dr. Oppenheimer a security 
risk. 

Loyalty is something you can’t 
divide. It has to be 100% or noth- 
ing. If you are ninety-eight per cent 
loyal, you’re still short as far as a 
vital seourity risk is concerned. That 
other two per cent is enough to give 
an enemy agent all he wants. “Few 
such associations” are a few such 
associations too many, regardless of 
evidence of other loyalty or discre- 
tion. One single indiscretion with 
one single spy can wreck the coun- 
try. History has too many such 
cases to ignore them. And the 
United States Government leans 
over backwards in an effort to be 
fair towards spies, subversives and 
disloyal persons. I think this is 
rather obvious. Dr. Oppenheimer 
admitted associating with Com- 
munists, and he had failed to ad- 
here strictly to security rules and 
other factors. In Russia they would 
have kept him under 24-hour guard 
and the only person he could talk to 
would have been himself or one of 
the Kremlin dogs. If he had es- 


4 



caped his keepers and had been 
found mingling with a bunch of 
U.S. capitalists, they would have 
shot him. 

Now and then, as in any law, 
there are shades of guilt or inno- 
cence, but in a verdict there can be 
only black and white — guilty or 
not guilty. The security of a nation 
is too big a thing to gamble with. 
And while these brilliant men feel 
they are doing the right thing in 
proposing that standards pertain- 
ing to our national security be re- 
vised, let’s remember one thing: 
not one of them, nor the group, is 
more important than the nation 
they serve. Therefore, whether se- 
curity regulations seem right or 
wrong, they have submitted them- 
selves to its dictates and decrees by 
becoming the eminent scientists 
they are. 

WELL, I FINALLY went and did it. 

For seven or eight years I have 
repeatedly convinced myself that I 
would never become such an addict 
as I have seen other people become. 
And I have reserved a great deal 
of sympathy for those stricken with 
this particular habit. Now, all that’s 
changed. A few days ago I became 
a full fledged member of that new 
social order that has taken the con- 
versation gambit away from the 
fishermen and the hunters and the 
skiers and golfers and others. And 
it looks like I shall become an ad- 
dict too — because I obtained a 
gadget or an instrument or device 
or whatever it is that causes people 
to re-do their living habits more 
than any other invention of modern 
times. Because of this gadget or in- 
strument I find that I shall spend 
several times its cost in partitioning 

A CHAT WITH THE EDITOR 


off a room, putting in a couple of 
doors, laying some sort of floor and 
decorating the joint. Then I shall 
get chairs and ash trays and peanut 
bowls and special lights. I shall put 
in a stock of liquid refreshments 
and nicknacks and short order 
stuff. I shall have to adjust my eat- 
ing habits, my reading habits and 
my sleeping hours. I shall get quite 
used to unexpected telephone calls 
from people whose gadgets have 
gone out of order. I shall get used 
to unexpected people showing up 
at the door with the excuse that 
they just happened to be passing 
my way at a certain time. I shall 
become used to considerable irrita- 
tion and susceptible to ulcers be- 
cause it isn’t working right; or 
because somebody else wants some- 
thing I don’t want or vice versa. I 
shall view corn served a hundred 
different ways and cuss myself for 
wasting time and sleep and go right 
back and do it again the next night. 
I shall tell bald face lies — that will 
out-do those of the most ardent 
fishermen — about how good my 
gadget works. I shall discuss and 
argue about certain electronic de- 
vices, politics, personalities, sports, 
parts and installations with the 
greatest authority — when I don’t 
know a damn thing about them. I 
shall dwell in the dark, shutting out 
the good daylight and the wonder- 
ful view of the Catskill Mountains 
and the fresh air of the four sea- 
sons. 

I shall spend all my free time, 
and a lot of time that isn’t free, 
slouched in a chair down below the 
ground in my cellar . 

For that is where my new tele- 
vision set is located.

THE JUNGLE 


Mbarara was Austin s city, his dream, a civilization carved 
from the screaming depths of the Jungle . The culture 
and sciences of his people would see that it lived. And the 
“magic” of old Bohawah would see that it died . 


BY CHARLES BEAUMONT 


S UDDENLY it was there. On 
foxfeet, invisibly, it had crept, 
past all the fences and traps he had 
laid, past all the barriers. And now 
it sat inside his mind, a part of him, 
like his pulse, like the steady beat 
of his heart. 

Richard Austin became rigid in 
the chair. He closed his eyes and 



strained the muscles in his body 
until they were silent and un- 
moving as granite; and he listened 
to the thing that had come again, 
taking him by surprise even while 
he had been waiting. He listened 
to it grow — it seemed to grow; he 
couldn’t be sure: perhaps he was 
merely bringing it into sharper 
focus by filtering out the other 
constant sounds : the winds that 
whispered through the foliage of 
balloon-topped trees the murmur- 
ous insect-drone of all the ma- 
chines that produced this wind and 
pumped blood through the city 
from their stations far beneath the 
night-heavy streets. Or, perhaps, it 
was because he was searching, try- 
ing to lay hands on it that the 
thing seemed to be different to- 
night, stronger, surer. Or — what 
did it matter? 

He sat in the darkened room and 
listened to the drums; to the even, 
steady throb that really neither rose 
nor diminished, but held to that 
slow dignified tempo with which 
he’d become so familiar. 

Then quickly he rose from the 
chair and shook his head. The 
sounds died and became an in- 
distinguishable part of the silence. 
It was only concentration, he 
thought, and the desire to hear 
them that gave them life . 

Richard Austin released a jagged 
breath from his swollen lungs, pain- 
fully. He walked to the bar and 
poured some whiskey into a glass 
and drank most of it in a single 
swallow: it went down his dry 

throat like knives, forcing the sal- 
ivary glands back into action. 

He shook his head again, turned 
and walked back across the living 
room to the far door. It swung out 

8 


noiselessly as his hand touched the 
ornamented circle of hammered 
brass. 

The figure of his wife lay per- 
fectly still under the black light, 
still and pale, as she had lain three 
hours before. He walked toward 
her, feeling his nostrils dilate at 
the acrid medicine smells, harshly 
bitter and new to his senses. He 
blinked away the hot tears that 
had rushed, stinging, to his eyes; 
and stood for a time, quietly, try- 
ing not to think of the drums. 

Then he whispered: “Mag . 
Mag, don’t die tonight!” 

Imbecile words! He clenched his 
fists and stared down at the face 
that was so full of pain, so twisted 
with defeat, that now you could not 
believe it had once been different, 
a young face, full of laughter and 
innocence and courage. 

The color had gone completely. 
From the burning splotchy scarlet 
of last week to this stiff white mask, 
lifeless, brittle as drying paste. And 
covered over with perspiration that 
glistened above her mouth in cold 
wet buttons and over her face like 
oil on white stone. The bedding 
under and around her was drenched 
gray. 

Austin looked at the bandage 
that covered his wife’s head, and 
forced away the memory, brutally. 
The memory of her long silver 
hair and how it had fallen away 
in clumps in his hands with a week 
after she had been stricken . 

But the thoughts danced out of 
control, and he found himself re- 
membering all the terrible steps 
in this nightmare. 

The scientists had thought it 
malaria, judging from the symp- 
toms, which were identical. But 

CHARLES BEAUMONT 



that was difficult to accept, for 
malaria had been effectively con- 
quered — powerful new discoveries 
in vaccines having been adminis- 
tered first, and then the primary 
cause of the disease itself — the Ano- 
pheles mosquitoe — destroyed com- 
pletely. And the liquid alloys which 
formed the foundations for this 
new city eliminated all the likely 
breeding places, the bogs and 
marshlands and rivers. No instance 
of re-occurrence of the disease 
had been reported for half a cent- 
ury. Yet — malarial parasites were 
discovered in the bloodstreams of 
those first victims, unmistakable 
parasites that multiplied at a swift 
rate and worked their destruction 
of the red corpuscles. And the 
chemists immediately had to go 
about the business of mixing med- 
icines from now ancient prescrip- 
tions, frantically working against 
time. A disquieting, even a fright- 
ening thing; but without terror for 
the builders of the new city; not 
sufficient to make them abandon 
their work or to spark mass evacua- 
tions. Panic was by now so for- 
gotten by most that it had become 
a new emotion, to be learned all 
over again. 

It had not taken very long to re- 
learn, Austin recalled. Terror had 
come soon enough. The stricken — 
some thirty husky workmen, en- 
gineers, planners — had rallied un- 
der the drugs and seemed to be out 
of critical condition when, one 
night, they had all suffered re- 
lapses, fallen into fevered comas 
and proceeded to alternate between 
unconsciousness and delirium. The 
scientists were baffled. They tried 
frenziedly to arrest the parasites, 
but without success. Their med- 


icines were useless, their drugs and 
radium treatments and innova- 
tions — all, useless. Finally, they 
could only look on as the disease 
took new turns, developed strange 
characteristics, changed altogether 
from what they had taken to be 
malaria to something utterly for- 
eign. It began to assume a horrible 
regular pattern: from prolonged 
delirium to catatonia, whereby the 
victim’s respiratory system and 
heartbeat diminished to a condi- 
tion only barely distinguishable 
from death. And then, the most 
hideous part: the swift decomposi- 
tion of the body cells, the destruc- 
tion of the tissues . 

Richard Austin carefully con- 
trolled a shudder as he thought of 
those weeks that had been the be- 
ginning. He fingered out a cigarette 
from his pocket, started to strike 
it, then broke the cylinder and 
ground its bright red flakes into his 
palms. 

No other real hint had been 
given, then : only the disease. Some- 
one had nicknamed it “Jungle Rot” 
— cruel, but apt. The victims were 
rotting alive, the flesh falling from 
them like rain-soaked rags; and 
they did not die wholly, ever, until 
they had been transformed into al- 
most unrecognizable mounds of 
putrescence . 

He put out a hand and laid it 
gently against his wife’s cheek. The 
perspiration was chill and greasy 
to his touch, like the stagnant 
water of slew banks. Instinctively 
his fingers recoiled and balled back 
into fists. He forced them open 
again and stared at the tiny dottles 
of flesh that clung to them. 

“Mag!” It had started already! 
Wildly, he touched her arm, ap- 

9 


THE JUNGLE 



plying very slight pressure. The 
outer skin crumbled away, leaving 
a small wet gray patch. Austin’s 
heart raced; an involuntary move- 
ment caused his fingers to pinch his 
own wrists, hard. A wrinkled spot 
appeared and disappeared, a small, 
fading red line. 

She’s dying, he thought. Very 
surely, very slowly, she’s begun to 
die — Mag. Soon her body will turn 
gray and then it will come loose; 
the weight of the sheet will be 
enough to tear big strips of it away 
. She’ll begin to rot, and her 
brain will know it — they had dis- 
covered that much : the victims 
were never completely comatose, 
could not be adequately drugged 
— she will know that she is mould- 
ering even while she lives and 
thinks . 

And why? His head ached, throb- 
bed. Why? 

The years, these past months, 
the room with its stink of decay — 
everything rushed up, suddenly, 
filling Austin’s mind. 

If I had agreed to leave with the 
rest he thought, to run away, then 
Mag would be well and full of life. 
But — I didn’t agree . 

He had stayed on to fight. And 
Mag would not leave without him. 
Now she was dying and that was 
the end of it. 

Or — he turned slowly — was it? 
He walked out to the balcony. The 
forced air was soft and cool; it 
moved in little patches through the 
streets of the city. Mbarara, his 
city; the one he’d dreamed about 
and then planned and designed 
and pushed into existence ; the 
place built to pamper five hundred 
thousand people. 

Empty, now, and deserted as a 

10 


gigantic churchyard 

Dimly he recognized the sound 
of the drums, with their slow muf- 
fled rhythm, directionless as al- 
ways, seeming to come from every- 
where and from nowhere. Speaking 
to him. Whispering. 

Austin lit a cigarette and sucked 
the calming smoke into his lungs. 
He remained motionless until the 
cigarette was down to the cork. 

Then he walked back into the 
bedroom, opened a cabinet and 
took a heavy silver pistol. 

He loaded it carefully. 

Mag lay still; almost, it seemed 
to Austin, expectant, waiting. So 
very still and pale. 

He pointed the barrel of the pis- 
tol at his wife’s forehead and curled 
his finger around the trigger. An- 
other slight pressure and it would 
be over. Her suffering would be 
over. Just a slight pressure! 

The drums droned louder until 
they were exploding in the quiet 
room. 

Austin tensed and fought the 
trembling, gripped the pistol with 
his other hand to steady it. 

But his finger refused to move 
on the curved trigger. 

After a long moment, he lowered 
his arm and dropped the gun into 
his pocket. 

“No.” He said it quietly, un- 
dramatically. The word hit a bar- 
rier of mucus and came out high- 
pitched and child-like. 

He coughed. 

That was what they wanted him 
to do — he could tell, from the 
drums. That’s what so many of the 
others had done. Panicked. 

“No.” 

He walked quickly out of the 
room, through the hall, to the ele- 

CHARLES BEAUMONT 



vator. It lowered instantly but he 
did not wait for it to reach bottom 
before he leapt off and ran across 
the floor to the barricaded front 
door. 

He tore at the locks. Then the 
door swung open and he was out- 
side; for the first time in three 
weeks — outside, alone, in the city. 

He paused, fascinated by the 
strangeness of it. Impossible to be- 
lieve that he was the only white 
man left in the entire city. 

He strode to a high-speed walk- 
way, halted it and stepped on. Set- 
ting the power at half with his 
passkey, he pressed the control but- 
ton and sagged against the rail as 
the belt whispered into movement. 

He knew where he was going. 
Perhaps he even knew why. But 
he didn’t think about that; instead, 
he looked at the buildings that slid 
by silently, the vast rolling spheres 
and columns of colored stone, the 
balanced shapes that existed now 
and that had once existed only in 
his mind. And he listened to the 
drums, wondering why the sound 
of them seemed natural and his 
buildings suddenly so unnatural, so 
strange and disjointed. 

Like green balloons on yellow 
sticks, the cultured “Grant Wood” 
trees slipped by, uniform and 
straight, arranged in aesthetically 
pleasing designs on the stone is- 
lands between belts. Austin smiled: 
The touch of nature. Toy trees, 
ruffling in artificial winds ... It 
all looked, now, like the model he 
had presented to the Senators. 
About as real and lifelike. 

Austin moved like a carefully 
carved and painted figurine, in- 
credibly small and lonely-looking 
on the empty walkway. He thought 

THE JUNGLE 


about the years of preparation; the 
endless red tape and paper work 
that had preceeded the actual job. 
Then of the natives, how they had 
protested and petitioned to in- 
fluence the Five-Power govern- 
ments and how that had slowed 
them down. The problem of 
money, whipped only by pounding 
at the point of over-population, 
again and again, never letting up 
for a moment. The problem of 
workers. The problems, prob- 
lems . 

He could not recall when the 
work itself had actually begun — 
it was all so joined. Laying the first 
railroad could certainly not have 
been a particle as beset with diffi- 
culty. Because the tribes of the 
Kenya territory numbered into the 
millions; and they were all filled 
with hatred and fury, opposing the 
city at every turn. 

No explanation had satisfied 
them. They saw it as the destruc- 
tion of their world and so they 
fought. With guns and spears and 
arrows and darts, with every re- 
source at their disposal, refusing to 
capitulate, hunting like an army 
of mad ants scattered over the 
land. 

And, since they could not be con- 
trolled, they had to be destroyed. 
Like their forests and rivers and 
mountains, destroyed, to make 
room for the city. 

Though not, Austin remembered 
grimly, without loss. The white 
men had fine weapons, but none 
more fatal than machetes biting 
deep into neck flesh or sharp wood- 
en shafts coated with strange poi- 
sons. And they did not all escape. 
Some would wander too far, un- 
used to this green world where a 

11 



man could become hopelessly lost 
within three minutes. Others would 
forget their weapons. And a few 
were too brave. 

Austin thought of Joseph Fava, 
the engineer, who had been re- 
ported missing. And of how Fava 
had come running back to the camp 
after two days, running and scream- 
ing, a bright crimson nearly dead 
creature out of the worst dreams. 
He had been cleanly stripped of all 
his skin, except for the face, hands, 
and feet. 

But, the city had grown, im- 
placably, spreading its concrete and 
alloy fingers wider every day over 
the dark and feral country. Noth- 
ing could stop it. Mountains were 
stamped flat. Rivers were damned 
off or drained or put elsewhere. 
The marshes were filled. The ani- 
mals shot from the trees and then 
the trees cut down. And the big 
gray machines moved forward, 
gobbling up the jungle with their 
iron teeth, chewing it clean of its 
life and all its living things. 

Until it was no more. 

All of Kenya, and most of Tan- 
ganyika, leveled, smoothed as a 
highway is smoothed, its centuries 
choked beneath millions and mil- 
lions of tons of hardened stone. 

The birth of a city ... It had be- 
come the death of a world. 

And Richard Austin was its 
murderer. 

A S HE traveled, he thought of 
the shaman, the half-naked, 
toothless Bantu medicine man who 
had spoken for most of the tribes. 
“You have killed us, and we could 
not stop you. So now we will wait , 
until you have made your city and 

12 


others come to live here. Then you 
will know what it is to die. 39 Bo- 
kawah, who lived in superstition 
and fear, whom civilization had 
passed, along with the rest of his 
people. Who never spoke again 
after those words, and allowed him- 
self to be moved to the wide iron 
plateau that had been built for the 
surviving natives. 

Bokawah, the ignorant shaman, 
with his eternal smile . How 
distinct that smile was now! 

The walkway shuddered, sud- 
denly, and jarred to a noisy grind- 
ing stop. Austin pitched forward 
and grasped the railing in order to 
break his fall. 

Awareness of the silence came 
first. The eerie dead silence that 
hung like a pall. It meant that the 
central machines had ceased func- 
tioning. They had been designed 
to operate automatically and per- 
petually; it was unthinkable that 
these power sources could break 
down! 

As unthinkable as the drums that 
murmured to life again beyond the 
stainless towers, so loud now in the 
silence, so real. 

Austin gripped his pistol tightly 
and shook away the panic that had 
bubbled up like acid in his chest. 
It was merely that the power had 
gone off. Strike out impossible, in- 
sert improbable. Improbabilities 
happen. The evil spirits do not 
summon them, they happen. Like 
strange diseases. 

1 am fighting, he thought, a 
statistical paradox. That's all. A 
storage pile of coincidences . If I 
wait — he walked close to the sides 
of the buildings — and fight , the 
graph will change. The curve 
will . 


CHARLES BEAUMONT 




The drums roared out a wave of 
scattered sound, stopped, began 
again . 

He thought a bit further of 
charts; then the picture of Mag 
materialized, blocking out the thick 
ink lines, ascending and descending 
on their giant graphs. 

Thinking wasn’t going to help. 

He walked on. 

Presently, at the end of a curve 
in the city maze, the ‘village’ came 
into view, suspended overhead like 
a gigantic jeweled spider. It thrust 
out cold light. It was silent. 

Austin breathed deeply. By belt, 
his destination was only minutes 
away. But the minutes grew as he 
walked through the city, and when 
he had reached the lift, hot pains 
wrenched at his muscles. He stood 
by the crystal platform, working 
action back into numbed limbs. 

Then he remembered the silence, 
the dead machines. If they were 

THE JUNGLE 


not functioning, then the ele- 
vator — 

His finger touched a button, ex- 
perimentally. 

A glass door slid open with a 
pneumatic hiss. 

He walked inside, and tried not 
to think as the door closed and the 
bullet-shaped lift began to rise. 

Below, Mbarara grew small. The 
treated metals glowed in a dimming 
lace of light. And the city looked 
even more like the little clay model 
he had built with his hands. 

At last movement ceased. Austin 
waited for the door to slide open 
again, then he strode out onto the 
smooth floor. 

It was very dark. The artificial 
torches did not even smolder: their 
stubs, he noticed, were blackened 
and cold. 

But the gates to the village lay 
open. 

He looked past the entrance into 

13 




the frozen shadows. 

He heard the drums, throbbing 
from within, loud and distinct. But 
— ordinary drums, whose sound- 
waves would dissipate before ever 
reaching the city below. 

He walked into the village. 

The huts, like glass blisters on 
smooth flesh, sat silent. Somehow, 
they were obscene in the dark, to 
Austin. Built to incorporate the 
feel and the atmosphere of their 
originals and yet to include the 
civilized conveniences; planned 
from an artistic as well as a scien- 
tific standpoint — they were sud- 
denly obscene. 

Perhaps, Austin thought, as he 
walked, perhaps there was some- 
thing to what Barney had been 
saying . No — these people had 
elected to stay of their own free 
will. It would have been impossible 
to duplicate exactly the monstrous 
conditions under which they had 
lived. If not impossible, certainly 
wrong. 

Let them wallow in their back- 
ward filth? In their disease and 
corruption, let them die — merely 
because their culture had failed to 
absorb scientific progress? No. You 
do not permit a man to leap off the 
top of a hundred-story building 
just because he has been trained to 
believe it is the only way to get to 
the ground floor — even though you 
insult him and blaspheme against 
his gods through your intervention. 
You restrain him, at any cost. 
Then, much later, you show him 
the elevator. And because he is a 
man, with a brain no smaller than 
yours, he will understand. He will 
understand that a crushed supersti- 
tion is better than a crushed head. 
And he will thank you, eventually. 

14 


That is logic. 

Austin walked, letting these 
thoughts form a thick crust. He felt 
the slap of the pistol against his 
thigh and this, also, was comfort- 
ing. 

Where were they now? Inside 
the huts, asleep? All of them? Or 
had they, too, contracted the dis- 
ease and begun to die of it? . 

Far ahead, at the clearing which 
represented the tip of the design, a 
glow of light appeared. As he ap- 
proached, the drums grew louder, 
and other sounds — voices. How 
many voices? The air was at once 
murmurous and alive. 

He stopped before the clearing 
and leaned on the darkness and 
watched. 

Nearby a young woman was 
dancing. Her eyes were closed, 
tightly, and her arms were straight 
at her sides like black roots. She 
was in a state of possession, danc- 
ing in rhythm to the nearest drum. 
Her feet moved so fast they had 
become a blur, and her naked body 
wore a slick coat of perspiration. 

Beyond the dancing woman, 
Austin could see the crowd, squat- 
ted and standing, swaying; over a 
thousand of them — surely every na- 
tive in the village! 

A clot of brown skin and bright 
white paint and brilliant feathers, 
hunched in the firelight. 

An inner line of men sat over 
drums and hollow logs, beating 
these with their palms and with 
short sticks of wood. The sounds 
blended strangely into one — the 
one Austin had been hearing, it 
seemed, all his life. 

He watched, fascinated, even 
though he had witnessed Bantu 
ceremonies countless times in the 


CHARLES BEAUMONT 



past, even though he was perfectly 
familiar with the symbols. The little 
leather bags of hex-magic: nail- 
filings, photographs, specks of flesh ; 
the rubbing boards stained with 
fruit-skins ; the piles of bones at the 
feet of the men — old bones, very 
brittle and dry and old. 

Then he looked beyond the na- 
tives to the sensible clean crystal 
walls that rose majestically, cup- 
ping the area, giving it form. 

It sent a chill over him. 

He walked into the open. 

T HE THRONG quieted, instant- 
ly, like a scream cut off. The 
dancers caught their balance, 
blinked, drew in breath. The others 
lifted their heads, stared. 

All were turned to dark unmov- 
ing wax. 

Austin went past the gauntlet of 
eyes, to one of the painted men. 

“Where is Bokawah?” he said 
loudly, in precise Swahili. His voice 
regained its accustomed authority. 
“Bokawah. Take me to him.” 

No one moved. Hands lay on the 
air inches above drums, petrified. 
“I have come to talk!” 

From the corner of his eye, Aus- 
tin felt the slight disturbance. He 
waited a moment, then turned. 

A figure crouched beside him. A 
man, unbelievably old and tiny, 
sharp little bones jutting into loose 
flesh like pins, skin cross-hatched 
with a pattern of white paint, 
chalky as the substance some wid- 
ows of the tribes wore for a year 
after the death of their mates. His 
mouth was pulled into a shape not 
quite a smile, but resembling a 
smile. It revealed hardened tooth- 
less gums. 

THE JUNGLE 


The old man laughed, suddenly. 
The amulet around his chicken- 
neck bobbled. Then he stopped 
laughing and stared at Austin. 

“We have been waiting,” he said, 
softly, Austin started at the per- 
fect English. He had not heard 
English for a long time; and now, 
coming from this little man . 
Perhaps Bokawah had learned it. 
Why not? “Walk with me, Mr. 
Austin.” 

He followed the ancient shaman, 
dumbly, not having the slightest 
idea why he was doing so, to a 
square of moist soil. It was sur- 
rounded by natives. 

Bokawah looked once at Austin, 
then reached down and dipped his 
hands into the soil. The horny fin- 
gers scratched away the top-dirt, 
burrowed in like thin, nervous ani- 
mals, and emerged, finally, holding 
something. 

Austin gasped. It was a doll. 

It was Mag. 

He wanted to laugh, but it 
caught in his throat. He knew how 
the primitives would try to inflict 
evil upon an enemy by burying his 
effigy. As the effigy rotted, sym- 
bolically, so would . 

He snatched the doll away from 
the old man. It crumbled in his 
hands. 

“Mr. Austin,” Bokawah said, 
“I’m very sorry you did not come 
for this talk long ago.” The old 
man’s lips did not move. The voice 
was his and yet not his. 

Austin knew, suddenly, that he 
had not come to this place of his 
own accord. He had been sum- 
moned. 

The old man held a hyena’s tail 
in his right hand. He waved this 
and a slight wind seemed to come 

15 



up, throwing the flames of the fire 
into a neurotic dance. 

“You are not convinced, even 
now, Mr. Austin. Aiii. You have 
seen suffering and death, but you 
are not convinced.” Bokawah 
sighed. “I will try one last time.” 
He squatted on the smooth floor. 
“When you first came to our coun- 
try, and spoke your plans, I told 
you — even then — what must hap- 
pen. I told you that this city must 
not be. I told you that my people 
would fight, as your people would 
fight if we were to come to your 
land and build jungles. But you 
understood nothing of what I said.” 
He did not accuse; the voice was 
expressionless. “Now Mbarara lies 
silent and dead beneath you and 
still you do not wish to understand. 
What must we do, Mr. Austin? 
How shall we go about proving to 
you that this Mbarara of yours will 
always be silent and dead, that 
your people will never walk through 
it?” 

Austin thought of his old college 
friend Barney — and of what Bar- 
ney had once told him. Staring at 
Bokawah, at this scrawny, painted 
savage, he saw the big Texan clear- 
ly, and he remembered his wild 
undergraduate theories — exhuming 
the antique view of primitives and 
their religions, their magics. 

“Go on, pal, laugh at their 
tabus 33 Barney, who was an an- 
thropologist, used to be fond of 
saying, “sneer, while you throw 
salt over your shoulder . Laugh at 
their manas, while you blab about 
our own ‘geniuses 3 ! 33 

He had even gone beyond the 
point of believing that magic was 
important because it held together 
the fabric of culture among these 

16 


natives, because it — and their re- 
ligious superstitions — gave them a 
rule for behavior, therefore, in 
most cases, happiness. He had even 
come to believe that native magic 
was just another method of arriv- 
ing at physical truths. 

Of course, it was all semantic 
nonsense. It suggested that primi- 
tive magic could lift a ship into 
space or destroy disease or . 

That had been the trouble with 
Barney. You could never tell when 
he was serious. Even a social an- 
thropologist wouldn’t go so far as 
to think there was more than one 
law of gravity. 

“Mr. Austin, we have brought 
you here for a purpose. Do you 
know what that purpose is?” 

“I don’t know and I don’t — ” 
“Have you wondered why you, 
alone, of all your people, have been 
spared? Then — listen to me, very 
carefully. Because if you do not, 
then what has happened in your 
new city is merely the beginning. 
The winds of death will blow over 
Mbarara and it will be far more 
awful than what has been.” The 
medicine man stared down at the 
scattered piles of bones. Panther 
bones, Austin knew — a divination 
device. Their position on the 
ground told Bokawah much about 
the white people. 

“Go back to your chiefs. Tell 
them that they must forget this 
city. Tell them that death walks 
here and that it will always walk, 
and that their magic is powerful 
but not powerful enough. It cannot 
stand against the spirits from time 
who have been summoned to fight. 
Go and talk to your chiefs and tell 
them these things. Make them be- 
lieve you. Force them to under- 

CHARLES BEAUMONT 



stand that if they come to Mbarara, 
they will die, in ways they never 
dreamed, of sickness, in pain, slow- 
ly. Forever.” 

The old man’s eyes were closed. 
His mouth did not move at all and 
the voice was mechanical. 

“Tell them, Mr. Austin, that at 
first you thought it was a strange 
new disease that struck the work- 
ers. But then remind them that 
your greatest doctors were power- 
less against the contagion, that it 
spread and was not conquered. Say 
these things. And, perhaps, they 
will believe you. And be saved.” 

Bokawah studied the panther 
bones carefully, tracing their ar- 
rangement. 

Austin’s voice was mechanical, 
also. “You are forgetting some- 
thing,” he said. He refused to let 
the thoughts creep in. He refused 
to wonder about the voice that 
came through closed lips, about 
where the natives could have found 
soil or fresh panther bones or . 
“No one,” he said to the old man, 
“has fought back — yet.” 

“But why would you do that, Mr. 
Austin, since you do not believe in 
the existence of your enemy? 
Whom shall you fight?” Bokawah 
smiled. 

The crowd of natives remained 
quiet, unmoving, in the dying fire- 
light. 

“The only fear you hold for us,” 
Austin said, “is the fear that you 
may prove psychologically harm- 
ful.” He looked at the crushed doll 
at his feet. The face was whole; 
otherwise, it lay hideously disfig- 
ured. 

“Yes?” 

“Right now, Bokawah, my gov- 
ernment is sending men. They will 

THE JUNGLE 


arrive soon. Whey they do, they 
will study what has happened. If 
it is agreed that your rites — how- 
ever harmless in themselves — cause 
currents of fear — are in any way 
responsible for the disease — you 
will be given the opportunity to go 
elsewhere or — ” 

Or, Mr. Austin?” 

“ — you will be eliminated.” 
“Then people will come to 
Mbarara. Despite the warnings and 
the death, they will come?” 

“Your magic sticks aren’t going 
to scare away five hundred thou- 
sand men and women.” 

“Five hundred thousand . .” 
The old man looked at the bones, 
sighed, nodded his head. “You 
know your people very well,” he 
murmured. 

Austin smiled. “Yes, I do.” 
“Then I think there is little left 
for us to talk about.” 

Austin wanted to say, No, you’re 
wrong. We must talk about Mag! 
She’s dying and I want to keep her 
from dying. But he knew what 
these words would mean. They 
would sketch his real feelings, his 
fears and doubts. And everything 
would be lost. He could not admit 
that the doll was anything more 
than a doll. He must not! 

The old man picked up a cala- 
bash and ran water over his hands. 
“I am sorry,” he said, “that you 
must learn the way you must.” 

A slow chant rose from the na- 
tives. It sounded to Austin like 
Swahili, yet it was indistinct. He 
could recognize none of the words, 
except gonga and bagana. Medi- 
cine? The man with the medicine? 
It was a litany, not unlike the 
Gregorian chants he had once 
heard, full of overpowering melan- 

17 



choly. Calm and ethereal and sad 
as only the human voice can be 
sad. It rode on the stale air, swell- 
ing, diminishing, cutting through 
the stench of decay and rot with 
profound dignity. 

Austin felt the heaviness of his 
clothes. The broken machines had 
stopped pumping fresh breezes, so 
the air was like oil, opening the 
pores of his body, running coldly 
down his arms and legs. 

Bokawah made a motion with 
his hand and sank back onto the 
smooth floor. He breathed wrack- 
ingly, and groaned as if in pain. 
Then he straightened and looked 
at Austin and hobbled quickly 
away. 

The drums began. Movement 
eased back into the throng and 
soon the dancers were up, working 
themselves back into their pos- 
sessed states. 

Austin turned and walked quick- 
ly away from the ceremony. When 
he had reached the shadows, he 
ran. He did not stop running until 
he had reached the lift, even while 
his muscles, long dormant, unac- 
customed to this activity, turned to 
stone, numb and throbbing stone. 

He stabbed the button and closed 
his eyes, while his heart pumped 
and roared sound into his ears and 
colored fire into his mind. The plat- 
form descended slowly, unemotion- 
al and calm as its parts. 

Austin ran out and fell against a 
building, where he tried to push 
away the image of the black magic 
ceremony, and what he had felt 
there. 

He swallowed needles of pain 
into his parched throat. 

And the fear mounted and 
mounted, strangling him slowly . 

18 


T HE TOWERS of Mbarara 
loomed, suddenly, to Austin, 
more unreal and anachronistic 
than the tribal rites from which he 
had just come. Stalagmites of crys- 
tal pushing up to the night sky that 
bent above them; little squares and 
diamonds and circles of metal and 
stone. Office buildings; apartments; 
housing units; hat stores and ma- 
chine factories and restaurants; 
and, cobwebbing among them, all 
these blind and empty shells, the 
walkways, like colored ribbons, like 
infinitely long reptiles, sleeping 
now, dead, still. 

Or, were they only waiting, as 
he wanted to believe? 

Of course they’re waiting, he 
thought. People who know the an- 
swers will come to Mbarara to- 
morrow. Clear-headed scientists 
who have not been terrorized by a 
tribe of beaten primitives. And the 
scientists will find out what killed 
the workers, correct it, and people 
will follow. Five hundred thousand 
people, from all over the closet- 
crowded world, happy to have air 
to breathe once more — air that 
hasn’t had to travel down two- 
hundred feet — happy to know the 
Earth can yet sustain them. No 
more talk, then, of “population de- 
creases”— murder was a better 
word — ; no more government 
warnings screaming “depopulation” 
at you . 

The dream would come true, 
Austin told himself. Because it 
must. Because he’d promised Mag 
and they’d lived it all together, 
endless years, hoped and planned 
and fought for the city. With 
Mbarara, it would begin : the dark 
age of a sardine can world would 
end, and life would begin. It would 

CHARLES BEAUMONT 



be many years before the worry 
would begin all over — for half the 
earth lay fallow, wasted. Australia, 
Greenland, Iceland, Africa, the 
Poles . And perhaps then the 
population graph would change, as 
it had always changed before. And 
men would come out of their cav- 
erns and rat-holes and live as men. 

Yes. But only if Mbarara worked. 
If he could show them his success 
here . 

Austin cursed the men who had 
gone back and screamed the story 
of what had happened to the other 
engineers. God knew there were 
few enough available, few who had 
been odd enough to study a field 
for which there seemed little fur- 
ther use. 

If they’d only kept still about the 
disease! Then others would have 
come and . 

Died . The word came out in- 
stantly, uncalled, and vanished. 

Austin passed the Emperor, the 
playhouse he had thought of that 
night with Mag, ten years before. 
As he passed, he tried to visualize 
the foyer jammed with people in 
soup-and-fish and jeweled gowns, 
talking of whether the play had 
meat or not. Now, its marbled front 
putting out yellow glow, it looked 
foolish and pathetic. The placard 
case shone through newly gathered 
dust, empty. 

Austin tried to think of what 
had been on this spot originally. 
Thick jungle growth alone. Or had 
there been a native village — with 
monkeys climbing the trees and 
swinging on vines and white widows 
mourning under straw roofs? 

Now playing: JULIUS 
CAESAR. Admission: Three coco- 
nuts. 

THE JUNGLE 


Be still. You’ve stayed together 
all this time, he thought, you can 
hold out until tomorrow. Tchelet- 
chew will be here, sputtering under 
his beard, and they’ll fly Mag to a 
hospital and make her well and 
clear up this nonsense in a hurry. 

Just get home. Don’t think and 
get home and it will be all right. 

The city was actually without 
formal streets. Its plan did not in- 
clude the antiquated groundcars 
that survived here and there in old 
families. Therefore, Mbarara was 
literally a maze. A very pretty 
maze. Like an English estate — Aus- 
tin had admired these touches of 
vanished gentility — the areas were 
sometimes framed by green stone 
hedges, carved into functional 
shapes. 

He had no difficulty finding his 
way. It was all too fresh, even now, 
the hours of planning every small 
curve and design, carefully leaving 
no artistic ‘holes’ or useless places. 
He could have walked it blind- 
folded. 

But when he passed the food dis- 
pensary and turned the corner, he 
found that it did not lead to the 
’copter-park, as it should have. 
There were buildings there, but 
they were not the ones they ought 
to have been. 

Or else he’d turned the wrong — 
He retraced his steps to the point 
where he had gone left. The food 
dispensary was nowhere in sight. 
Instead he found himself looking 
at the general chemistry building. 

Austin paused and wiped his 
forehead. The excitement, of 
course. It had clouded his mind for 
a moment, making him lose his 
way. 

He began walking. Warm per- 

19 




spiration coursed across his body, 
turning his suit dark-wet, staining 
his jacket. 

He passed the food dispensary. 

Austin clenched his fists. It was 
impossible that he could have made 
a complete circle. He had built this 
city, he knew it intimately. He had 
walked through it without even 
thinking of direction, in the half- 
stages of construction, and never 
taken a wrong step. 

How could he be lost? 

Nerves. Nothing strange in it. 
Certainly enough had happened to 
jar loose his sense of direction. 

Calmly , now. Calmly. 

The air hung fetid and heavy. 
He had to pull it into his lungs, 
push it out. Of course, he could go 
below and open the valves — at 
least they could be operated by 
hand. He could, but why? It would 
mean hunching down in a dark 
shaft — damn, should have made 
that shaft larger! And, there were, 
after all, enough openings in the 
sealing-bubble to keep a breathable 
flow of oxygen in circulation. If the 
air was heavy and still outside the 
bubble, he could scarcely expect it 
to be different within . 

He looked up at the half-minar- 


20 


CHARLES BEAUMONT 



etted tower that was one of the 
’copter repair centers. It was lo- 
cated in exactly the opposite direc- 
tion to the one he thought he’d 
taken. 

Austin sank onto a stone bench. 
Images floated through his mind. 
He was lost; precisely as lost as if 
he had wandered into the jungle 
that had stood here before the 
building of Mbarara, and then 
tried to find his way back. 

He closed his eyes and saw a pic- 
ture, startlingly clear, of himself, 
running through the matted 
growths of dark green foliage, 
stumbling across roots, bumping 
trees, face grotesque with fear, and 
screaming . 

He opened his eyes quickly, 
shook away the vision. His brain 
was tired; that was why he saw 
such a picture. He must keep his 
eyes open. 

The city was unchanged. The 
park, designed for housewives who 
might wish to pause and rest or 
chat, perhaps feed squirrels, sur- 
rounded him. 

Across the boating lake was the 
university. 

Behind the university was home. 

Austin rose, weakly, and made 
his way down the grassy slope to 
the edge of the artificial lake. Cul- 
tured city trees dotted the banks: 
the lake threw back a geometrically 
perfect reflection. 

He knelt and splashed water into 
his face. Then he gulped some of it 
down and paused until the ripples 
spread to the center of the lake. 

He studied his image in the 
water carefully. White skin, smooth 
cheeks, iron-colored hair. Good 
clothes. A dolichocephalic head, 
evenly spaced, the head of a twen- 

THE JUNGLE 


ty-second century civilized . 

Above his reflection, Austin de- 
tected movement. He froze and 
blinked his eyes. As the water 
smoothed, the image of an animal 
appeared on the surface, wavering 
slightly. A small animal, something 
like a monkey. Like a monkey 
hanging from the branches of a 
tree. 

Austin whirled around. 

There was only the darkness, the 
golfing-green lawn, the cultured 
trees — smooth-barked, empty. 

He passed a hand through his 
hair. It was a trick of the lights. 
His subconscious fear, the shim- 
mering water . 

H E WALKED quickly to the 
darkened boathouse, across its 
floor, his footsteps ringing against 
the stone, echoing loudly. 

At the end of the miniature pier, 
he untied a small battery boat and 
jumped into it. He pulled a switch 
at the side, waited, forced himself 
to look back at the deserted bank. 

The boat moved slowly, with 
only a whisper of sound, through 
the water. 

Hurry , Austin thought. Hurry — 
Oh God, why are they so slow! 

The boat, whose tin flag pro- 
claimed its name to be Lucy, sliced 
the calm lake with its toy prow, 
and, after many minutes, reached 
the center. 

The glow was insufficient to 
make the approaching bank dis- 
tinct. It lay wrapped in darkness, 
a darkness that hid even the build- 
ings. 

Austin narrowed his eyes and 
stared. He blinked. It was the fuz- 
ziness of the luminescence, of 


21 



course, that gave movement to the 
bank. That made it seem to seethe 
with unseen life. 

It was only that his position to 
the shadows kept changing that 
made them turn into dark and 
feral shapes; trees, where buildings 
surely were, dense growth . 

It was the milky phosphorescence 
of the metals that rose like marsh- 
steam from the nearing water . 

He thought of stepping of! the 
boat into a jungle, a magical for- 
est, alive and waiting for him. 

He closed his eyes and gripped 
the sides of the boat. 

There was a scraping. Austin felt 
the cement guard, sighed, switched 
off the battery and leapt from the 
little boat. 

There was no jungle. Only the 
lime-colored city trees and the 
smooth lawn. 

The university sat ahead like a 
string of dropped pearls: blister- 
shaped, connected by elevated tun- 
nels, twisting, delicate strands of 
metal and alloy. 

Austin scrambled up the em- 
bankment. It must be very late 
now. Perhaps nearly morning. In a 
few hours, the others would arrive. 
And — 

He halted, every musde strain- 
ing. 

He listened. 

There were the drums. But not 
only the drums, now. 

Other sounds. 

He closed his eyes. The airless 
night pressed against him. He 
heard a rustling noise. Like some- 
thing traveling through dense 
brush. He heard, far away, tiny 
sounds, whistlings, chitterings. Like 
monkeys and birds. 

He fore open his eyes. Only the 

22 


park, the city. 

He went on. Now his feet were 
on stone and the park was behind 
him. He walked through the can- 
yons of the city again, the high 
buildings, metal and crystal and al- 
loy and stone. 

The rustling noises did not cease, 
however. They were behind him, 
growing nearer. Bodies, moving 
through leaves and tall grass. 

Austin suddenly remembered 
where he’d heard the sound before. 
Years ago, when he’d first visited 
this land. They had taken him on a 
hunting expedition, deep into the 
wild country. They were going to 
bag something — he forgot exactly 
what. Something strange. Yes; it 
was a wild pig. They had walked 
all day, searching, through the high 
tan grass, and then they had heard 
the rustling sounds. 

Exactly like the sound he heard 
now. 

Austin recalled the unbelievable 
fury of the boar, how it had dis- 
embowled two dogs with a couple 
of swipes of those razor-sharp fangs. 
He recalled clearly the angry black 
snout, curled over yellow teeth. 

He turned and stared into the 
darkness. The noises grew steadily 
louder, and were broken by yet an- 
other sound. Deep and guttural, 
like a cough. 

As the sound behind him came 
closer, he ran, stumbled and fell, 
pulled himself from the stone and 
ran until he had reached a flight 
of steps. 

The coughing noise was a fast, 
high-pitched scream now, a grunt- 
ing, snorting, a rush of tiny feet 
galloping across tamped earth, 
through dry grass. Austin stared 
blindly, covered his face with his 

CHARLES BEAUMONT 



arms and sank back until the sound 
was almost upon him. 

His nostrils quivered at the ani- 
mal smell. 

His breath stopped. 

He waited. 

It was gone. Fading in the dis- 
tance, the rustling, the coughing, 
and then there was the silence of 
the drums again. 

Austin pressed the bones of his 
wrist into his throbbing skull to 
quiet the ache. 

The panic drained off slowly. 
He rose, climbed the steps and 
walked through the shadowed 
courtyard onto the campus. 

It was a vast green plain, smooth 
and grassy. 

Across from it, in sight, was Aus- 
tin’s home. 

He gathered his reason about 
him like a shield, and decided 
against taking the other routes. If 
he had gotten lost before, it could 
happen again. Certainly now, with 
his imagination running wild. 

He must cross the campus. 

Then it would be all right. 

He began treading, timorously 
at first, listening with every square 
inch of his body. 

The shaman’s voice slithered into 
his mind. Chanting. “. you were 
destroying us against our will , Mr. 
Austin. Our world, our life. And 
such is your mind, and the mind 
of so-called ( civilized 3 men, that you 
could not see this was wrong. You 
have developed a culture and a 
social structure that pleased you, 
you were convinced that it was 
right; therefore, you could not un- 
derstand the existence of any that 
differed. You say us as ignorant 
savages — most of you did — and you 
were anxious to ‘ civilize ’ us. Not 


once did it occur to you that we, 
too, had our culture and our social 
structure ; that we knew right and 
wrong; that, perhaps, we might 
look upon you as backward and 
uncivilized . .” 

The sound of birds came to Aus- 
tin; birds calling in high trees, cir- 
cling impossibly in the night sky. 

. we have clung to our 
‘magic’, as you call it, and our ‘su- 
perstitions’ for longer than you 
have clung to yours. Because — as 
with your own — they have worked 
for us. Whether magic can be ex- 
plained in Roman numerals or not, 
what is the difference, so long as it 
works? Mr. Austin, there is not 
only one path to the Golden City — 
there are many. Your people are on 
one path — ” 

He heard the chatter of monkeys, 
some close, some far away, the 
sound of them swinging on vines, 
scolding, dropping to mounds of 
foliage, scrambling up other trees. 

— my people are on another. 
There is room in this world for 
both ways. But your failure to grasp 
this simple fact has killed many of 
us and it will kill many more of 
you. For we have been on our path 
longer. We are closer to the Golden 
City . .” 

Austin clapped his hands to his 
ears. But he did not stop walking. 

From the smooth stone streets, 
from the direction of the physics 
department, came the insane trum- 
peting of elephants, their immense 
bulks crashing against brittle bark, 
their huge feet crunching fallen 
limbs and branches . 

The shaman’s voice became the 
voice of Barney Chadfield . He 
spoke again of his theory that if 
one could only discover the unwrit- 


THE JUNGLE 


23 



ten bases of black magic and apply 
formulae to them, we would find 
that they were merely another form 
of science . perhaps less ad- 
vanced, perhaps more. 

The sounds piled up, and the 
feelings, and the sensations. Eyes 
firmly open, Austin thought of Mag 
and felt needled leaves slap in- 
visibly against his legs; he smelled 
the rot and the life, the heavy, wild 
air of the jungle, like animal steam; 
the odors of fresh blood and wet 
fur and decaying plants; the short 
rasping breath of a million differ- 
ent animals — the movement, all 
around him, the approaches, the 
retreats, the frenzied unseen . 

Eyes open he felt and smelled 
and heard all these things; and saw 
only the city. 

A pain shot through his right 
arm. He tried to move it: it would 
not move. He thought of an old 
man. The old man had a doll. The 
old man was crushing the doll’s 
arm, and laughing . He thought 
of reflexes and the reaction of re- 
flexes to emotional stimuli. 

He walked, ignoring the pain, 
not thinking about the arm at all. 

. tell them , Mr. Austin. Make 
them believe. Make them believe 
. Do not kill all these people . 

When he had passed the Law 
College, he felt a pain wrench at 
his leg. He heard another dry-grass 
rustle. But not behind him : in 
front. Going forward. 

Going toward his apartment. 

Austin broke into a run, without 
knowing exactly why. 

There was a pounding, a pant- 
ing at his heels: vaguely he was 
aware of this. He knew only that 
he must get inside, quickly, to the 
sanity of his home. Jaws snapped, 


clacked. Austin stumbled on a vine, 
his fingers pulled at air, he leapt 
away and heard the sound of some- 
thing landing where he had just 
been, something that screamed and 
hissed. 

He ran on. At the steps, his foot 
pressed onto something soft. It re- 
coiled madly. He slipped and fell 
again, and the feel of moist beaded 
skin whipped about his legs. The 
thunder was almost directly above. 
He reached out, clawed lose the 
thing around his leg and pulled 
himself forward. 

There was a swarming over his 
hands. He held them in front of 
his eyes, tried to see the ants that 
had to be there, slapped the invisi- 
ble creatures loose. 

The apartment door was only a 
few feet away now. Austin remem- 
bered his pistol, drew it out and 
fired it into the night until there 
were no more bullets left. 

He pulled himself into the lobby 
of the unit. 

The door hissed closed. 

He touched the lock, heard it 
spring together. 

And then the noises ceased. The 
drums and the animals, all the wild 
nightmare things — ceased to be. 
There was his breathing, and the 
pain that laced through his arm 
and leg. 

He waited, trembling, trying to 
pull breath in. 

Finally he rose and limped to 
the elevator. He did not even think 
about the broken machines. He 
knew it would work. 

It did. The glass doors whirred 
apart at his floor, and he went out 
into the hall. 

It was soundless.

THE $1000 PRIZE WINNING STORY 

in IFs College Science Fiction Contest 


And Gone 
Tomorrow 


BY ANDY OFFUT 


Here is the best story submitted in answer to the theme question: 
"What Will Life in America Be Like 100 Years From Now ?” 
. Written by an undergraduate at the University of Louis- 
ville, Louisville , Kentucky , it pictures the America of 2054 as 
part of a world empire run by an Italian dictator and very sim- 
ilar to that of the ancient Caesars and the early Roman Empire. 
There is one language, one religion and customs and laws have 
changed to stdt the times . But, basically, human nature hasn’t 
changed and there is the omnipresent clash of faction against 
faction. The theme is that a dictatorship is the only perfect 
form of government . If there is a moral, it is that there is no 

permanent form of government.

He looked up from the floor. 

“Well?” 

“So I’m a thinking man and an 
educated man. And what happens? 
I’m sapped. I’m shanghaied. I’m 
walking down Confederate Place to 
my old fraternity house at 1:00 in

middle. He’s Doctor Borley, of the 
University of Louisville Chemistry 
Department. There’s another man 
with him. A little fellow with thick 
glasses and a crew cut and eyes like 
the slits between closed Venetian 
blinds. He’s Doctor Schink, of the 
Psychology Department. They’re 
talking about me.” 

“Umn hmn. Now you’re begin- 
ning to sound normal. Doctors Bor-

1954. Do you know where you 
were?” 

“I told you. In some sort of steel

The man made an impatient ges- 
ture with his hand. “No, I mean 
where. You were in a steel chamber 
in the Daynolds Metals Plant. It 
stood on this spot in 1954. Two 
people knew — know — about that 
room.” 

“Doctor Borley and Doctor 
Schink?” 

“I’m glad you’ve calmed down. 
Now we can talk.” 

Jay wasn’t quite ready to calm 
down. “You stand there in that 
Roman outfit and talk about being 
calm. To me. To me, Jay Welch, a 
history major who took his AB from 
the University of Louisville in 
1950. Jay Welch, average guy, who

“Then you admit you’ve come

Ilaria cursed quietly. “But you’re

and psychology and geopolitics and

a bus driver or a steam-fitter. So?” 
“So here you are. 1954’s repre-

“Yes! And what happens tomor-

work? What happens in a few days 
when people find out I’ve disap- 
peared? What happens when they 
find out Julie was the last person I

“You’re getting yourself worked 
up again, Jay Welch. Don’t you 
think we have thought of those 
things? We’ve brought you across 
one hundred years, Jay Welch.” 
“Yes,” Jay said quietly, flatly. 
“Yes.” Then just as flatly, just as 
quietly he said, “Why?” 

“So you’ve remembered to won- 
der about that at last.” Uaria 
smiled. Jay noticed that the smile 
was one-sided and pulled back the 
left corner of Uaria’s mouth. He 
stood there and looked down at Jay 
Welch, who had forgotten that he 
was sitting on the floor. His tunic 
was white and there were three 
diamond-shaped silver pieces in a 
vertical line on each elbow-length 
sleeve. There was a wide blue stripe 
and a narrow silver stripe at the 
hem of his tunic and at his sleeves. 
He wore sandals. His belt was 
leather and there was a holstered 
pistol of some sort hanging at his 
left hip. In tiny blue script above 
his * left breast pocket were the 
words ‘Trib. Ilaria’. On the pocket 
was a red disk with the letters PR. 
A silver-worked blue cloak was 
flung over his shoulders. Except for 
the identification and the odd fab- 
ric of his clothes and the holstered 
gun he looked very like a young 
Roman of the first century. 

Ilaria’s slow smile pulled back 
the left corner of his mouth. “Be- 
cause you are who you are and 
what you are. Because you attended 
the University of Louisville and 

AND GONE TOMORROW 


Doctors Borley and Schink knew 
you. Because they chose you. Mere- 
ly because they chose you. They 
might’ve chosen anyone else. 

“We’ve your personality pretty 
well mapped out. We expected vio- 
lence. That’s why I’m here. I’m a 
psychologist and an anthropologist. 
I’m a fast-talker and I can convince 
people and place them at ease. I’m 
also big enough to handle you, Jay 
Welch.” 

From his position on the floor Jay 
looked up at Ilaria and decided 
the man from 2054 was big enough. 
Jay Welch was six feet one inch 
tall. He weighed one seventy-three 
and wore a 40-long suit. Kevin 
Ilaria was bigger. 

Jay was forced to grin. The tall 
blond man was a likeable guy, at 
that. A human being. 

“Who are you?” 

“Kevin Ilaria. Doctor of Psychol- 
ogy. That entitles me to the silver 
band on my tunic. Also a Tribune. 
That entitles me to the blue stripe 
and the three silver diamonds and 
the gun.” 

“A Tribune? In what? Of 
what?” 

“In the Forces. In the actual 
ranks, a Tribune commands 7,000 
men, 250 planes or a base, or 40 
tanks. But I’ve never had a chance 
to go into the field. There has been 
no cause to fight. Meantime I’m 
stationed at Standiford Field as sec- 
ond-in-command. A friend of mine 
named Rinaldi fills in for me. He’s 
a Sub-Tribune. 

“I’ve been specializing in the 
study of Time.” 

“The way you say Time it sounds 
as though it were capitalized. 
Where I come from Time with a 
capital T is a magazine.”

Kevin Ilaria laughed. He reached 
down a hand. “Get up,” he said, 
and, taking Jay’s forearm, helped 
him to his feet. 

“Let’s go,” he said. 

Jay didn’t bother to ask where 
they were going. He followed the 
Tribune out the door and into the 
hall. On the wall just outside the 
door, was a black box. Two squares 
cut into it shone with a faint white 
light. Ilaria paused and shielded the 
lighted areas a moment with his 
hand, and Jay saw the light go out 
in the room they had just left. Ilaria 
closed the door. As he turned, Jay 
saw the white letters PR embla- 
zoned on the back of his cloak. 

“This way,” he said. Jay noticed 
that Ilaria walked on his right, so 
that the Tribune’s gun was between 
them. 

“The way I said Time, it is capi- 
talized. It means all the Time since 
the beginning. It’s a corporation, 
like your Duo-Point. Only much 
larger, and much less known. Our 
job is to learn.” 

“That’s a big order,” Jay com- 
mented. “You learn by — borrowing 
— emissaries?” 

Ilaria laughed again. “Thanks 
for the phraseology, but it wouldn’t 
worry me if you called it ‘kidnap- 
ing’ or ‘shanghaiing.’ You’re right, 
of course. We learn by sending men 
from this age to other ones, and by 
pulling men from other ages to this 
one. Doctor Schink is our Emissary 
to 1954. His real name is Clyde 
Gabrinaldi. Borley is our contact 
there . rather, then.” 

“Well I’ll be damned! I’ve gone 
to Clyde a lot of times for advice.” 

The left corner of Uaria’s mouth 
pulled back as his grin widened. 
“Umn hmn. He’s married, too. 

32 


With a child. He’s there for good.” 
Jay was afraid to ask if emi^ 
saries from the past to 2054 were 
“there for good” too. He changed 
the subject. 

“You started to tell me before — ” 
“Oh, yes. I’m to be your teacher 
and companion. But I’ll try to give 
you a quick fill-in. Our world of 
2054 is quite different from yours. 
And, we hope, in better shape. 
We’ve proved that the only way to 
maintain world peace is by world 
government. And the only success- 
ful type of government is a dicta- 
torship.” 

Jay gasped. “You mean the en- 
tire world — has reverted to dicta- 
torship?” 

Ilaria laughed. “Not reverted . 
We finally accepted it as the only 
logical form of government for an 
entire world.” 

“What happens when the dicta- 
tor goes wild? He always has.” 
The smile was there again. 
“You’re not quite ready for that,” 
Ilaria told him. “But, it has been 
taken into consideration.” 

Out of the corner of his eye, Jay 
saw the slight puff of Ilaria’s chest, 
the self-satisfied square of his shoul- 
ders, the quick set of his jaw. He 
wondered what part Tribune Kevin 
Ilaria played in the ‘dictator con- 
trol’ this world had provided. 

“The system has worked and is 
working. See this?” 

They turned a corner in the cor- 
ridor and faced a great domed 
room. On the far wall hung a white 
tapestry of something like 40 x 40 
foot dimensions. On it, emblazoned 
in letters of red and yellow made 
to look like flame, were the charac- 
ters PpB. In the lower right-hand 
comer, in white outlined with blue, 

ANDY OFFUT 



was the same PR that Ilaria wore. 
Jay waited for the Tribune’s ex- 
planation. 

“PpB stands for Pax per Bello,” 
Ilaria explained. “Peace through 
War. That slogan was written in 
1967 by Julius and adapted in 1971 
as official.” 

“Julius?” 

“Yes. The first Dictator.” 

Things were beginning to click 
in Jay’s mind. 

“I think I know what PR stands 
for,” he said. “Pax Romana.” 

As always, Ilaria smiled. “That’s 
right,” he said. 

HE COMMAND-CAR marked 
with the PR symbol pulled over 
and stopped. 

“What is it? Who are you?” the 
driver demanded. 

The Captain on the seat beside 
him peered into the blackness and 
cursed. 

The man who had waved the 
vehicle to a halt walked away. 

“Here!” the Captain cried. 
“What in blazes is going on here? 
Why’d you stop us? Centurion! 
Stop that man!” 

The two Centurions in the back 
seat looked at the Captain for a 
moment, then they both jumped 
out and ran after the man. 

An ellipsoidal grey thing streaked 
out of the darkness, landed in the 
driver’s lap and thudded to the 
floor of the car. The Captain threw 
open his door and started to climb 
out. The driver bent over to see 
what it was. 

At that moment the driver, the 
command-car and the Captain blew 
up. 

The silence that followed was 


broken by the blast of a submachine 
gun as it struck down the two cen- 
turions. 

“Take their weapons,” said a 
brittle voice. 

The detachment of soldiers from 
the garrison at Tel Aviv stopped 
and looked around. 

“Sir, what is it?” asked a guard 
anxiously. 

“Terribly quiet out here; some- 
thing’s up,” the Lieutenant mut- 
tered calmly. 

There were seven of them. The 
Lieutenant, the Centurion, and five 
legionaries. They had grown ac- 
customed to the quiet life of gar- 
rison men in a calm, conquered 
city. When there is nothing tangi- 
ble to be guarded, a guard’s life is 
a dull one. The guns they carried 
were the symbol of their authority, 
and had never been used for any 
other purpose. 

They looked around. The dirty, 
once-white buildings rose close on 
either side. There was no moon. 
There was no sound. The darkness 
and the silence could have been cut 
with a knife. 

The Lieutenant grinned. He 
didn’t feel much like grinning. He 
spoke. He didn’t feel much like 
talking, either. 

“This darkness is thick,” he said. 
“You could cut it with a knife. 
Wish I had a knife.” 

He got a knife. The men had just 
started to laugh when the Lieuten- 
ant got it. 

Between his shoulder blades. 

As the Lieutenant toppled for- 
ward, the Centurion dodged close 
against the dirty stone wall and 
yelled “Spread out!” 

They killed a lot of the shadowy, 



AND GONE TOMORROW

green-clad attackers, but there were 
only six of them and they were cor- 
nered. When the enemy drove a 
tank into the alley and sprayed 
them with its mounted gun they 
died. 

“Take their weapons/’ said a 
quiet voice. 

The half-track rolled to a stop. 

“Where, Sir?” the driver wanted 
to know. 

“Beyond that big crater over 
there. The sun glinted on metal. 
I’m sure of it. Didn’t you see it?” 

“No, Sir.” The driver craned his 
neck. There was nothing but barren 
rubble and bomb craters and torn, 
twisted metal and ruined buildings. 

“There are all sorts of old auto- 
mobiles lying around out there, 
Sir,” the driver volunteered. 

“Yes, and they’ve been here long 
enough to get good and rusty,” the 
Captain snapped. “This is some- 
thing else.” 

The driver craned his neck. 
There was nothing but rubble. 

Eight men in the back of the 
half-track leaped to their feet when 
they heard the faint clicking of 
KCN-H2S04 guns and the buzz of 
an old gamma gun and the sharp 
bark of a very old sub machine- 
gun. But a grenade landed on the 
truck and another rolled under it. 

Another wreck was added to the 
rubble. 

“Take their weapons, if there are 
any left,” said a quiet voice. 

A ND IN the more peaceful city 
of Louisville, Jay Welch was 
introduced to Kevin Ilaria’s best 
friend, his adjutant at Standiford 
Field. 

34 


Jay took a liking to Sub-Tribune 
Jason Rinaldi the moment he felt 
the fellow’s firm grip. 

“Jason is adjutant,” Ilaria ex- 
plained. “And one of the few ‘field 
soldiers’ who manages to get along 
with Caesar’s Pretorian Prefect, 
Lamberti. How he does it, I don’t 
know. Lamberti’s absolutely un- 
bearable.” 

“Prejudice. Middle-class preju- 
dices,” Rinaldi grinned. He was 
short and very dark with a lot of 
black hair. 

Ilaria’s left cheek cracked into a 
long dimple as he smiled. “He picks 
on me because I’m a serious psy- 
chologist.” 

Rinaldi laughed. “As a psycholo- 
gist, Kevin, you’re an excellent 
bridge player. As a soldier — ” 

“Just remember who’s got three 
bars and who has two.” 

Rinaldi waved his hand and 
shrugged. “They pass ’em out to 
psych boys wholesale,” he said, and 
ducked Ilaria’s swing. “Slow re- 
flexes, too,” he added as he turned 
to go. ^ 

Ilaria stopped him at the door 
and murmured a few sentences. 

Jay caught something about 
sabotage at Standiford. Rinaldi 
seemed to be attributing it to the 
Commanding Officer there. 

“Nice guy,” Jay said as the door 
closed behind Rinaldi. 

“You said it. Good officer, too. 
He’ll root out the bird who’s play- 
ing around out there. Can’t figure 
out why it’s being done.” 

“Factions,” Jay said, “ — within 
factions.” 

“Little ones always exist, I guess. 
Have you finished with the history 
films?” 

“I’ve seen them, yes. I’m still try- 

ANDY OFFUT 



in g to digest them.” 

“The language give you much 
trouble?” 

“Quite a bit, but I think I got 
most of it. 

“One man,” Jay went on won- 
deringly. “One man. A Captain in 
the Italian Army. 

“The Communist forces in Indo- 
China had been driven back and 
Captain — then Major — Lollabrigi- 
da went in after them. 

“The defeat was becoming so ter- 
rible that the Kremlin dealt itself a 
playing hand rather than the dum- 
my it had been playing. Red forces 
came piling in. Lollabrigida and 
his Italian troops stopped them 
cold. Then he seemed to sway. 
And, when the Commies pounced 
for the kill, they were trapped, 
pocketed, and annihilated. 

“American newspapers and com- 
mentators began to call Major 
Julius Lollabrigida ‘Julius Caesar.’ 
Italy became big overnight. The 
Big Three became Russia, the 
United States, and Italy. Lolla- 
brigida appealed to America — 
sometime in there they made him 
a Colonel, but he was actually tell- 
ing the Generals and the Italian 
government what to do — for aid in 
going ahead aggressively. 

“And America turned him down. 
They were still playing ‘wait and 
see.’ They waited. They waited too 
long. The Commies got tired of 
waiting around and sent a couple 
of jet bombers with A-bombs.” 

“Now you’re telling me things,” 
Ilaria interrupted. “I’m pretty 
shady on that period myself.” 

Jay shrugged. “It was after my 
time. All I know is what the films 
show. Two planes, each with a 
seven-man crew, and each carry- 

AND GONE TOMORROW 


ing one atomic bomb, were dis- 
patched from an airbase somewhere 
near Juneau.” Jay stopped. 

“And?” 

The man from 1954 choked. It 
was hard to be objective about this. 
It wasn’t so easy for him to pass off 
as the film had done. 

“And — ” he hesitated. 

“It’s over, Jay. It’s done with. It 
doesn’t even concern you anymore. 
It belongs to a past era.” 

“One was headed for New York. 
The other struck farther inland . 
for Washington. The first one was 
shot down by an F-117 border pa- 
trol plane. The other one got 
through. It — it levelled the capitol. 
Almost completely. The White 
House and the Pentagon were de- 
stroyed.” 

Ilaria sat quietly and waited. Jay 
didn’t go on. 

“Thus removing the United 
States of America, as such, from a 
prominent position in the world 
picture,” Ilaria said. 

“Yes. I can’t understand it. 
Everything just folded up. SAC 
didn’t even get off the ground. And 
Colonel Lollabrigida, by then Com- 
mander-in-Chief of the UN forces, 
sent fifty planes, each with one 
A-bomb, over the Kremlin. One 
was shot down over Vladivostok, 
but the bombardier pulled the fir- 
ing pin as the ship crashed and 
most of Vladivostok was destroyed. 
Six other planes made it to their 
destinations and dropped their 
loads. I can’t remember the cities 
. one was a new super airbase 
near Moscow. Five of the planes 
returned. None had managed to 
reach Moscow. Half the world was 
in ruins. The Pope begged that the 
War be stopped.” 

35 



Ilaria snorted. “He knew they’d 
hit Rome!” 

Jay looked at him. “Is that what 
you think?” 

Ilaria shrugged and flashed that 
quick, winning smile. “There are 
no other motives, are there?” 

Jay stared. What changes had 
taken place in religious philosophy 
in this hard-bitten world of 2054? 

Kevin Ilaria shrugged, smiling. 
“That’s unimportant. Let’s go on 
with the history lesson. Then 
what?” 

“Uh-oh, yes. As I remember 
Julius Lollabrigida, to be trite, 
launched an ‘all-out offensive’ 
against Communist forces every- 
where. People were afraid of Rus- 
sia, but they were afraid of Lolla- 
brigida and Rome, too. So they 
joined him. Aid poured into the 


UN. Czechoslovakia was taken and 
Poland and Hungary and finally 
only the old Russia of pre World 
War II days was left. And in they 
went. 

“Then Lollabrigida’s saboteurs 
exploded an atomic bomb in the 
heart of Moscow. After that it was 
pretty easy sledding.” 

“Astounding how a nation seems 
to fall apart when its capitol and 
its leaders are gone,” Ilaria re- 
marked. 

“Everybody and everything 
folds,” Jay said. “Moral dies. 

“After the demolition of Mos- 
cow and other parts of the USSR, 
Italy stood at the top. General of 
the Armies Julius Lollabrigida 
marched back into Italy and into 
Rome and into the capitol and up 
on a pedestal. He stood as Italy’s 


36 


ANDY OFFUT 


utter ruler. His last name was lost 
and replaced by ‘Caesar II.’ He was 
named Dictator. 

“From mighty Rome, Caesar sent 
out linguists and anthropologists 
and ethnologists and psychologists 
and military men and others. In 
twenty years, twenty peaceful years, 
Italian had become the language 
of the world. A few minor uprisings 
in America and in Japan and were 
smashed. Julius Caesar II was 
World Dictator of the Republic of 
Earth. Someone in America denied 
him and was torn to pieces by the 
people. Someone in Italy spread 
literature of dissension and was 
hunted down and liquidated by 
Caesar’s personal police, the Pre- 
toriani. And so it went. 

“Caesar adopted a prominent Air 
Force Colonel who became Caesar 
III on Lollabrigida’s death. Each 
year on his birthday men were si- 
lent. No business was transacted. 
No one left his home. Except blue- 
and-silver clad soldiers, wearing 
PR armbands. Caesar’s Pretorians. 
No one dared venture out. 

“During the reign of Caesar III, 
every person in the world changed 
his last name to an Italian one. The 
Ali bens and the Chicos and the 
Andres and the Fritzes and the 
Johns became Marianos and Roc- 
cos and Caldinis and Campisanos 
and diManos.” 

There was silence for a moment. 

“The thing I can’t understand,” 
Jay mused, “is why in all these 
years there hasn’t been a ‘bad’ 
Caesar, or an uprising.” 

“What do you mean by ‘bad’ 
Caesar?” 

Jay shrugged. “In the first Pax 
Romana there was Caligula, who 
was insane. Nero, who preferred 

AND GONE TOMORROW 


artistic diversions to politics. There 
was Galba, who didn’t know what 
was going on. And so on. And on 
and on. Your three dictators so far 
seem to have done excellent jobs. 
They, seem to be damned conscien- 
tious leaders.” 

“When you re-create something,” 
Ilaria told him, “you try to elimi- 
nate its faults.” 

“Of course. But what if Caesar’s 
son or a Caesar’s adopted son goes 
bad?” Jay elucidated. 

“So far we haven’t had that 
problem to deal with. But we’re 
ready. Each time a new Dictator 
comes to power, one thousand top 
military men draw folded pieces of 
plastipaper from a ‘bowl.’ On 
twenty of these are X’s. The others 
contain O’s. The twenty X’s are a 
secret organization, sworn to kill 
the Dictator if it should become 
necessary. When Caesar, as you 
say, ‘goes bad’.” 

“Brilliant!” Jay breathed. “And 
he — Caesar — never knows who 
they are?” 

“No one ever knows,” Ilaria said. 
“Not even the members. They re- 
main in contact, but none ever 
knows who the others are.” 

Jay remembered Ilaria’ s previ- 
ous mention of the system, and the 
unconscious swelling of the Tri- 
bune’s chest at the time. “You’re 
one,” he said. 

Ilaria was caught off guard. “I 
— yes,” he said. “I won’t ask how 
you knew.” 

“A guess. Then you’ve been a — 
whatever it’s called — for nine years, 
during Caesar V’s reign.” 

“That’s right.” 

“And you don’t know any of the 
others?” 

“Only one. I found out acciden- 

37 * 



tally. He — ” Ilaria stopped. 

Jay shrugged. “I won’t ask any 
more questions along that line,” he 
promised. “But I still can’t believe 
there haven’t been any uprisings!” 
“None. Caesar II died of a heart 
attack. Caesar III had a brain 
tumor which we learned about too 
late. His son never had a chance to 
prove himself, other than that he 
was brave and foolish. He swam the 
Rubicon at its widest point, then 
walked to Rome in his shorts in 
the dead of winter. He died of 
pneumonia. Caesar V, our Dictator 
today, is strong and quiet. He holds 
the Empire firmly unified. But he 
does nothing extraordinary. And 
he is too lenient.” 

“I just can’t conceive of such 
perfection!” 

Kevin Ilaria smiled. He walked 
over to the window and peered 
out. “You couldn’t. But this is the 
perfect government. Everyone is 
satisfied. One ruler. One capitol. 
One army. One language. One na- 
tionality. One world. One religion.” 
“I realize — ” Jay halted. “One 
religion?” he demanded. 

“Yes.” 

“What is it?” He found himself 
afraid of the answer. The indica- 
tions were there, in plain sight. He 
guessed it before Kevin Ilaria 
turned from the window and said: 
“Caesarism.” 


T HE MAN called Gaius Julius 
Caesar Imperator V turned 
from the window and rubbed his 
hand over his graying hair. 

“This is the first time I’ve ever 
run into anything of this sort.” 

The President 1 of the Senate 
shrugged. He was an old man who 

38 


had been placed in the Senate by 
his father in 1980. So long ago that 
people wondered when he would 
die. They were tired of these old 
men dictating to their ruler, as 
many people before them had been 
tired. The rise of the President of 
the Senate to leadership of that 
revered group had not been mete- 
oric by any means. But his mainte- 
nance of the position had been 
tenacious. He was a careful man. 

The President of the Senate 
shrugged. “It is. It is the first time 
anything of this sort has ever come 
up, Julius. Therefore it is up to 
you to set an example.” 

Caesar glanced over at General 
Bonadella. The General nodded in 
agreement with Senator Chianti. 

“This sort of business can break 
up the Empire if it’s allowed to 
continue, Caesar,” he said, in his 
pompous military way. “I say 
death.” 

Major DeCosta nodded quietly. 

“Thumbs down all around, is 
it?” Caesar sat down behind his 
desk and picked up the speaker of 
his private cable to London. He 
looked at the three men. 

“Commander in charge of Gar- 
rison C,” he said. 

There was a silent moment. 

They looked up as Prefect Lam- 
berti of the Pretorians, the Im- 
perial personal bodyguard (it had 
progressed far beyond that. Its en- 
rollment was tremendous ; its power 
second only to the Dictator’s) came 
in. The Senator nodded. The two 
field soldiers turned quickly away. 
The men of the field did not get 
along with the Pretorian dandies. 

“Commander? This is the Dic- 
tator,” Caesar said unnecessarily. 
The garrison commander knew 

ANDY OFFUT 



that only one person could call him 
on that line. The phone would re- 
act to no voice other than Caesar’s. 

“Have you the fellow who was 
preaching dissension? I say one 
year in prison. You heard me. Yes, 
one year. What? No! No torture!” 
He severed connections and looked 
up at his advisers. 

Prefect Lamberti shook his head. 
Senator Chianti turned and stalked 
out. After a moment General Bon- 
adella followed. The Major turned 
away to stare out the window. He 
shook his head. 

“del Ponta? This is the Dictator,” 
that quiet, flat voice said behind 
him. Caesar was calling the under- 
chief of the Pretoriani. “I will 
speak tomorrow from the balcony. 
Yes. 1400. Of course. World-wide. 
That’s right. Oh, I suppose about 
a quarter ’til.” 

The man who ruled the world 
stood up and stared at Major De- 
Costa’s back. At forty-one, Caesar 
was a gaunt man with stooped 
shoulders and sad lines running 
from his nostrils to the corners of 
his mouth. His forehead was lined 
and re-lined, and the keen brown 
eyes were dulled with years of de- 
cisions and hard work. 

He was tired. 

They called him the Hound be- 
cause his face bore the same sad, 
quiet look worn by those dogs. And 
they called him weak because he* 
let offenders off too easily. 

DeCosta turned around. The 
young Major met his Chief’s gaze. 

“Well?” The voice of the Dic- 
tator was quiet and calm. 

DeCosta’s eyes flickered. He 
straightened militarily. He 
shrugged. 

“It is not for me to say, Sir.” 

AND GONE TOMORROW

A slow smile spread over those 
weary features. “And you, Farouk?” 
Lamberti stretched out his arm 
and balled his fist with the thumb 
extended and pointing down. “You 
know me, Caesar.” 

“I do. Even my best friend dis- 
agrees with my decisions now, after 
all these years of elbow-rubbing. 

“You are usually more out- 
spoken, Major DeCosta. Have you 
nothing more to say?” 

DeCosta’s reply was slow in com- 
ing but rapid in delivery. “I am 
around Caesar much of late,” he 
rapped out. His back was stiff and 
military as he strode out of the 
Dictator’s office. 

Prefect Lamberti’s gloved hand 
dropped to the butt of his gun, but 
Caesar shook his head in gentle 
negation. 

Julius Caesar Imperator V gazed 
sadly at the closed door. 

J AY HAD given up trying to rea- 
son with Ilaria about God. The 
man was intelligent as well as bril- 
liant — there’s a tremendous differ- 
ence — about everything else, but he 
was stubbornly obstinate to Jay’s 
arguments. At least in Jay’s ter- 
minology he was stubbornly obsti- 
nate. All faith is stubborn obstinacy. 
Kevin Ilaria’s faith was appalling. 
His arguments were beautiful. 
Flawless. Jay thought of his old 
friend, Father O’mare. Even that 
great psychologist-priest would be 
hard-put, he decided. 

So he quit. He didn’t give up. 
He just quit. 

Can you tell a man the Earth’s 
flat after he’s been up in a jet? 

Can you talk a bullet out of pur-

Can you reason with a Marxist? 

“If a man can conquer the great- 
est enemy the world has ever faced, 
is he not God? If he can turn from 
killing and soldiering to soothing 
and pacifying, is he not God? If he 
can make the world one, after 
twenty-two centuries of ‘world an- 
archism’ is he not God? If he can 
maintain the peace and keep the 
people happy and heal all sores is 
he not God? If he just looks at you 
when you call him ‘God’ or ‘Savior 5 
and smiles and say ‘I ? 5 is he not 
God? If he chooses the perfect man 
to continue in his place, is he not 
God ? 55 

“But that’s proof! Why die? 
Isn’t God immortal?” 

“Only God could realize that one 
man can’t continue to reign in- 
definitely. His ideas, yes. But he 
must create another to carry on 
his ideas. There must be variety 
and diversions.” 

Unshakeable. Unquestioning. Jay 
could never understand a person’s 
sticking to the claim ‘I’m a Chris- 
tian’ or ‘I’m a Moslem’ when he 
would be killed for it. Jay had al- 
ways figured he’d have said to 
Nero’s men ‘Me? Me? A filthy 
Christian? Not I. I love Jupiter 
and Juno. Step inside and see my 
altars . .’ 

Now he was seeing what sturdy, 
rock-firm martyr faith was like. 

So he quit. 

Instead he learned about the 
gyro- jet cars which hugged the 
roads like lovers on a honeymoon. 
He watched them sprout stubby 
wings and breathe flame and soar 
straight up. He learned about say- 
ing ‘Open’ to a lock and having the 
electronic device ‘recognize’ him 
and let him in. He learned about 

40 


personalphones which ‘recognized’ 
your voice. He learned about the 
tiny pellet of potassium cyanide 
and sulphuric acid with which the 
guns were loaded. The pellets struck 
and broke and the victim was dead 
in seconds. Very humane. No 
maimed or wounded. Just the dead. 

He learned about self-shaping 
sandals — the most comfortable and 
most sensible shoes man had ever 
worn — and air baths and soft- 
voiced alarm clocks which politely 
told you it was time to get up 
and about unbreakable ring-finger 
chronos and about atomic heating 
and flawless plumbing and he saw 
plastic, plastic, plastic. 

He learned about all of them. 
But his real delight was the depila- 
tory cream. This, above all others, 
was man’s greatest invention. 

“No shaving ... no silly damned 
socks or tight, hot shoes or tie . 
no battery stalling or flat tires . 
I guess this is paradise, Kevin!” 
“And the perfect government 
and the perfect religion! All one 
race! One religion! One nation! 
One language! One nationality! 
One God!” Ilaria added exuber- 
antly.” 

“That reminds me. How come I 
never see any coloreds?” 

“Haven’t you? By the way, no 
murderous car insurance or ali- 
mony laws, either. And no need for 
them. All marriages are ideal.” 

Jay was readily detoured to this 
new novelty. 

“Now, don’t let’s go too far. 
Identical religion and race and 
customs and ideals and opinions 
may lower the' divorce rate a lot, 
but there’s still ye olde sex angle. 
A couple can go together twenty 
years and break up on the wedding 

ANDY OFFUT 



night. Some are hot and some are 
cold and some are slow and some 
are fast. The only thing you could 
have improved on, is sex education. 
It’s astounding how many people 
of my time know nothing about the 
sexual part of marriage. The most 
important part! 

“Of course it’s doing what comes 
naturally; but what if two people 
have been taught from different 
viewpoints? Or if one hasn’t been 
taught at all? Some people are ac- 
tually ashamed or embarrassed. 
There are intelligent people who 
don’t even know the biological 
facts! Few — especially women, 

know about the pleasure and the 
habit-forming angle. That’s the 
one thing than can break up some- 
thing beautiful in ten minutes. 

“Education, maybe. Human na- 
ture, no.” 

“Whew!” 

“Excuse me, Kevin, for launch- 
ing into a Phillipic, but that’s long 
been my pet peeve. Atrocious, de- 
plorable, and all that.” 

“We don’t usually tamper with 
human nature, Jay. As a rule, that 
is. This is going to come as a shock 
to you, with your silly, ‘atrocious 
and deplorable’ 1954 ideas and 
morals. 

“A trial period. A pre-marital 
period of living together for a 
couple of weeks. If the couple isn’t 
sexually suited, they either attempt 
to have it remedied by a physician 
or break off.” 

“A shock, yes,” Jay murmured, 
slowly shaking his head. “How did 
it ever start? Anyone who’d pro- 
pound an idea like that in my time 
would be accused of being some 
sort of perverted sex-fiend! 

“A foolproof, flawless plan to in- 

AND GONE TOMORROW 


sure happy marriages!” 

ALF ACROSS the world a 
door swung open and a tall 
dark man with piercing black eyes 
and a twin-tufted beard came in. 
His dark-green garment, faintly re- 
sembling a trench-coat, was dou- 
ble-breasted and belted and mili- 
tary cut. His feet were encased in 
plastileather boots which clicked as 
he came to attention before the 
desk. 

The plate on the desk read 
“Praefectus Praetoriani.” 

“Major del Ponta, Sir.” 

The man behind the desk looked 
up. “At ease, Major.” 

Major Ali ben del Ponta relaxed 
and waited. 

The man behind the desk fin- 
ished scanning the sheet of micro- 
paper, marked something on it with 
a stylo, stuck it in the pneumatube 
on the corner of his desk, and 
pushed the button to close his desk 
drawer. He looked up at Major 
Ali bel del Ponta. 

“Well?” He put his hands to- 
gether, fingers touching. 

“It has begun, Prefect Lamberti. 
All over the world our local men 
are leading their followers in at- 
tack. Captain Abram Mazzoli has 
sent in his report from Tel Aviv. 
The city is in his hands. Captain 
Mahomet DiSanto’s ‘Raiders’ have 
complete control of the Sahara. 
Captain Arnaldi’s forces are firmly 
entrenched in the old Washington 
area of America. He will move 
northward to meet Colonel Mag- 
nani’s forces from Canada and 
Commander Campisano. They — ” 
“Campisano’s airborne ready to 
roll?” 



41 



“Yes, Sir. Arrangements have 
been made. The drop will be just 
outside New York.” 

“Alright. Then everything has 
gone off as scheduled?” 

“Yes, Sir.” 

Prefect Farouk Lamberti re- 
garded his deskchron thoughtfully. 

“And Caesar will make his speech 
in twenty-five hours and thirty- 
three minutes?” 

Major del Ponta glanced at his 
own chron, which was strapped to 
the third finger of his left hand. 
“Yes, Sir. At 1400, tomorrow.” 
“Have the twenty-foot Visor 
screen activated for public showing. 
Mount it outside as we’d planned.” 
“It’s being taken care of, Sir. 
The screen is on its way to the 
Square. There will be a crowd.” 
“Good. We all want to hear 
noble Caesar.” 

Del Ponta grinned. “Yes, Sir. We 
all do. Especially tomorrow.” 

“He doesn’t know? — or suspect?” 
“He shouldn’t Sir. Our men took 
over and began covering up at 
once. You know the atrocious con- 
dition of world communications 
systems. The Empire could fall and 
Rome might not hear of it for 
days.” 

“That’s what I was counting on 
. that and the Disturber. The 
degeneracy of the field military is 
terrible. They are allowing them- 
selves to get lazy and fat and care- 
less.” 

“Yes, Sir.” 

“Have my car ready to drive to 
the Square behind Caesar’s tomor- 
row. See that the covermen in the 
houses around the Square are dou- 
bled and double-checked. But when 
we go to the show, let’s not have 
too great an exhibition of Imperial 

42 


power. We don’t want this thing 
to backfire and cut our own 
throats.” 

“Yes, Sir.” Del Ponta’s grin wid- 
ened. 

“Dismissed.” 

Del Ponta came to attention, sa- 
luted and about-faced and left. 

Prefect Lamberti opened his desk 
drawer and took out his old serv- 
ice pistol. It was a gamma gun. He 
had not released any of the deadly, 
slow- acting rays from its chamber 
in seven years. But it was ready. 

He opened another drawer and 
took out a white cloak, marked 
across the back with a blue dove 
and the single word ‘Liberacione.* 

He checked the pistol. 

OES THE Emissary from 1954 
get to meet Caesar?” Jay 
wanted to know. 

“Later. He’s to make a speech 
tomorrow afternoon. It will be 
world-televised.” 

“He looks very old and very 
tired,” Jay ventured. He’d seen 
Caesar on transcriptions of old 
speeches and on old newsreels. 

“He’s about . forty, I think. 
Somewhat weak. Very lenient.” 

“I would’ve guessed him to be a 
good deal older.” Then “Why 
weak? Because he’s lenient?” 

Ilaria smiled. “Remember, Jay, 
‘Pax per Bello.’ Too much leniency 
leads one’s subjects to be bold. 
Over-bold.” 

“One man’s opinion?” 

The Tribune shrugged. “No. 
Caesar doesn’t get along with his 
advisors too well. They criticize 
him for being too ready to forgive 
and forget.” 

The more Jay saw of this per- 

ANDY OFFUT 




feet world, the more he realized 
how cruel and hard people must be 
to maintain a paradise. If everyone 
is to be happy, someone must be 
unhappy. 

The trouble is, people don’t like 
to be told “This is for your own 
good.” 

Jay said so. 

“But if they’re sat on hard 
enough,” Ilaria rebutted, “They 
don’t have a chance ever to try 
anything else which they might 
think is for their own good . .” 

Jay nodded. Very true. As Ilaria 
left the room Jay went to the win- 
dow and looked out at the Louis- 
ville of 2054. For the millionth 
time in the seven days he’d been 
here, he wished he had a cigarette. 
They had been outlawed as detri- 
mental to health long ago. 

The fact that it had been seven 
days reminded him of something 
else left behind. 

Julie. 

“You’re a fool,” he finally told 
himself. No wonder Julie’d been 
on edge and acting what he termed 
‘odd’ lately! She was scared. He’d 
been out of school three and a half 
years. He was twenty-five. He’d just 
bought a new Olds. He’d begun 
buying his clothes at The Store 
rather than a store. Hell, he 
should’ve been married long ago. 
His days here were full. There were 
meetings with scientists and his- 
torians and militarists and linguists 
and everyone else Kevin could think 
up. He talked and listened and dis- 
cussed and lectured. But he thought 
of her every night. Every morning 
before he rose. At times like this, 
when he was alone for a few min- 
utes. 

Of course it was love! He’d al- 


ways thought too many people 
threw the word around too much. 
He’d always been afraid to use it 
because he wasn’t sure of its mean- 
ing. He’s used it once. And he’d 
been kicked in the teeth by the girl. 
He hadn’t used it since. 

When was a guy ever sure? 

Hogwash! Now he knew that 
each man forms his own definition. 
True, too many people used the 
word love indiscriminately. It’s mis- 
treated. Kicked around. Assumed 
and taken off. Dragged through 
messes and scandals and law courts 
and through the mud. But to a 
man like Jay Welch, to a man who 
has been afraid — yes, afraid — to 
use it, it must be there when he be- 
gins thinking in those terms. 

Love. He’d had to come across 
one-hundred years to realize he’d 
found its meaning. To realize he’d 
known its meaning a long time. To 
realize that love is whatever you 
make it, what you, yourself, call it. 
You define it yourself. Then you 
apply it. 

It had been there all the time. 
You don’t include someone in 
everything you do and everything 
you think without it. You don’t try 
to change her and yourself. To 
make her perfect. To make your- 
self perfect with — and for — her 
without it. This business about “ac- 
cepting” little faults — as well as big 
ones — , he decided, is for the birds. 
It’s human nature to translate other 
people in terms of yourself and try 
to change them in terms of your- 
self. To argue and be proud and 
hate like hell to have to make up. 
But you don’t make a project of it 
with everyone. Not unless . 

He and Julie had a lot to talk 
about. 


AND GONE TOMORROW 


43 



Then he remembered where he 
was and when he was. He thought 
of Doctor Schink. And suddenly he 
was scared. He remembered what 
Ilaria had said about Schink. ‘He’s 
there for good . .’ 

“He’s never said a word about 
my going back!” 

“Neither have you,” came Ilaria’s 
voice, and Jay whirled around to 
see the big psychologist coming 
through the door. 

“We’d like to keep you here as 
long as possible. But not against 
your wishes, of course. You were 
shanghaied, not kidnaped.” The 
left comer of his wide mouth 
pulled back in that slow, reassur- 
ing smile. 

“I stand chastised. Now I’ve 
thought of it, though, I can hardly 
wait.” 

“The day after tomorrow? I 
want you to hear Caesar speak. 
Then I want to talk a good deal 
more.” 

“Early, the day after tomorrow.” 
Then, little-boyishly, Jay hurriedly 
added a couple of reasons. “I’m 
getting tired of talking and being 
questioned. I feel like a talking ani- 
mal in the zoo.” 

Ilaria nodded, smiling. “Julie? 

“I figured it would occur to you 
sooner or later. Just because you 
think a little more deeply and care- 
fully than most men of your time 
doesn’t make you immune to love. 
That belongs to all times. Good 
luck and a lot of children.” 

Jay grinned. He’d met Ilaria’s 
wife and five of his six children the 
night before. He turned to look out 
the window once more. 

Beautiful. The elevated streets, 
with gyro-cars hurtling along . 
the sky full of more winged gyros 

44 


and planes . the streets below 
full of happy, white-faced, white- 
clad people . 

White-faced! 

“Kevin, you avoided my ques- 
tion the day before yesterday. I’ve 
been almost afraiB to ask you 
again. Why no Negroes?” 

“It will be hard for you to ac- 
cept, with your antiquated demo- 
cratic ideas.” Ilaria breathed a deep 
sigh. “Certain elements of dissen- 
sion and unrest, Jay, are better 
eliminated. Coloreds have always 
bred both. People are just like that. 
Whites and yellows and tans and 
reds can get along, but not blacks.” 

Jay had gotten along with them 
all his life. “In ancient Rome there 
were slaves . .” he said, trying to 
understand. 

“Not in this Rome. I said, better 
eliminated, Jay.” Ilaria went to the 
window and looked down at the 
scene below. He explained: 

“We exterminated them.” 

A hammer crashed down. A door 
slammed. A glass shattered. A siren 
screeched. A punch caught Jay in 
the solar plexus. Jay had experi- 
enced all these. Ilaria’s flat state- 
ment was worse. 

“Exter— No! Oh, No!” He 
swung around to face the big psy- 
chologist. Ilaria’s usual smile was 
gone. He looked solemn and very 
grim. 

“You weren’t ready for it. I 
don’t think we can discuss it. Just 
remember this : When you’ve a 
bunch of dogs and they all get 
along with one another except one, 
you don’t leave them together and 
you don’t try to keep them sepa- 
rated by a chicken-wire fence. It’s 
too unpleasant. You get rid of the 
troublemaker.” 


ANDY OFFUT 



URING the night the rebel 
forces moved out of Tel Aviv 
and took over Israel. They captured 
the entire devastated Washington 
area, a series of ten cities ringing 
Rome, and hundreds of other key 
spots. The world’s largest airbase 
at Madrid, Spain, was taken. 
Forces sent to the aid of the base 
defenders were met by an onslaught 
of their own planes. The troops 
didn’t have a chance. 

Dr. Montmorency Trumperi’s 
Wave Disturber had been outlawed 
in 2001. The plans were carefully 
filed away and the machine’s com- 
ponent parts junked. But the Dis- 
turber suddenly reappeared on the 
night of June 9, 2054, and world 
communications were stopped. 
Lamberti’s scientists had come up 
with a counter-radio mechanism, 
of course, so that the Rebels were 
able to maintain contacts. 

Louisville was not attacked. 
Lamberti and his men knew about 
the emissary from the past shel- 
tered there, and informed their 
fifth columnists at Standiford they 
wanted both the Man From 1954 
and Tribune Kevin Ilaria alive. 

New York was attacked by land 
and air. Tokyo fell. Everywhere 
white flags with the blue Libera- 
cione and the picture of a dove flut- 
tered above smoking battlegrounds. 
Everywhere men were on the 
march. 

When Tribune Kevin Ilaria 
stormed in twelve hours later, Jay 
noticed his friend was wearing his 
gun again. The cyanide pistol had 
not swung at his hip since the day 
of Jay’s arrival. He was also sur- 
prised to note that Ilaria wore 
boots and carried a steel helmet 


under his arm. 

There was a new quality in his 
voice. Brittle, static. The soft tones 
of the psychologist were gone. 

Jay realized that this was Tri- 
bune Ilaria of the Forces, not Dr. 
Ilaria the psychologist. 

“You sure you want to leave here 
tomorrow?” he demanded curtly. 

Instantly Jay was on the defence. 
“I am,” he said coldly. 

Ilaria’s smile looked forced. “I’ve 
been authorized to offer you a Sub- 
Tribunate in the Forces.” 

“What?” 

“You’ve had experience. None 
of us have. You’ve been in actual 
combat, in the Air Force.” 

“Why? I don’t—” 

“War,” Ilaria said simply. “Re- 
bellion.” 

Jay stared at him. He couldn’t 
think of anything to say. 

Ilaria turned away. “Paradise. 
The Iron Hand. One religion and 
one language and all that. Utterly 
cock-sure. But . we were wrong. 
They’ve been getting ready. Train- 
ing and planning. Collecting men 
and arms. They began even before 
the empire was established.” — Jay 
noticed he said empire rather than 
republic — “All this time they’ve 
been preparing and planning and 
. waiting.” 

Jay was dumbfounded. “How 
big is it?” 

Kevin Ilaria spread his hands. 
“Big enough. Their attack seems 
to have been simultaneous all over 
the world. Something like com- 
mando or guerrilla tactics. Quick, 
quiet attacks on a small scale.” 

He told Jay about the Tel Aviv 
incident and about Captain Spag- 
noletti and a half-track disappear- 
ing in the rubble in the Washing- 

45 



AND GONE TOMORROW 



ton area and about intercontinental 
communication being shut off. 

“Bomb ’em out/’ Jay said, with- 
out thinking. 

“You don’t bomb out fifth col- 
umnists, Jay. 

“Last night they captured Lon- 
don and Tokyo and two-thirds of 
New York and they captured Lol- 
labrigida airbase in Madrid. 
They’re wearing PR uniforms and 
some kind of new uniform they’ve 
dreamed up. Most of them aren’t 
even uniformed. It’s a hell of a 
mess.” 

“How long do you think it’ll take 
to quell the thing?” 

“I have no idea. I’m to take 
command at Standiford Field. Rin- 
aldi solved the saboteur problem 
. it was Colonel Di Orio. Rinaldi 
and some of his boys caught the 
Colonel and a few of his men in 
the Radio Room on the special 
‘Liberacione’ wave length.” 

“In irons?” Jay wanted to know. 

“No. They put up a fight. They 
were killed.” 

“You’re flying?” 

“Doubt it. I’ll be one of those be- 
hind-the-scenes men. Supposed to 
be valuable. Only in a mess like 
this you can’t tell what’s behind 
the scenes and what’s front line. 
They’re liable to start on Louisville 
next.” 

Ilaria hitched self-consciously at 
his gun-belt. He twisted his helmet 
around a couple of times before he 
set it gingerly on his head. He 
turned and opened the door and 
went out. His head came back in 
and said: 

“I’m not sure it’s the sort of 
thing you quell, Jay.” 

“Kevin! Wait! What’m I sup- 
posed to — ” 

46 


He was gone. 

Jay thought only a moment. 
Then he switched on the phone. 
At least intercom systems were still 
in operation. The clerk at the desk 
upstairs looked at him from the 
screen. 

“This is the Man From 1954,” 
Jay said, using the name by which 
everyone called him. “Stop Tri- 
bune Ilaria as he goes out.” 

In an instant Kevin’s head ap- 
peared. 

“I’ll go with you. Shall I get my 
uniform before we go to Standiford 
or after?” 

Ilaria grinned. “After,” he said. 
“Grab the elevator and come on 

)5 

up. 

This isn’t your fight, Jay Welch, 
a voice told him as he opened the 
door. You don’t even belong here, 
Jay Welch, the voice told him as 
he ran out into the hall. You’re 
crazy to go to bat for these mon- 
sters, Jay Welch, the voice told him 
as he pushed the elevator button. 
You fought before for a bunch of 
people who didn’t appreciate it 
one damned bit, Jay Welch. Re- 
member about the Iron Hand and 
the Negroes, the voice told him 
as the doors opened and he stepped 
in. Remember you were shang- 
haied, it said, as the car shot up- 
ward and the bottom of his stom- 
ach felt as if it had been left 
behind. Remember you were go- 
ing back to Duo Point and Her- 
man’s and Joe Scaccia’s restaurant 
and Julie and tie and suit and 
Julie and the tight shoes and Julie 
and personal freedom and Julie 
and Jerry, the black guy you 
worked with and liked so well and 
Julie and the new Olds and Julie. 
Tomorrow you were going back. 

ANDY OFFUT 



The doors shot back. He stepped 
out on the roof. 

“Mister Welcci?” said the clerk. 
“That’s Tribune Ilaria’s plane over 
there.” 

He pointed to the little PR ship 
marked with the three silver dia- 
monds of a Tribune and the staff 
of psychology. Jay ran. Wind was 
whipping across the roof and their 
cloaks streamed out and fluttered. 
The three men came together. 

“This is Commander DeVito, 
Jay. Commander, Jay Welch, The 
Man From 1954.” The way Ilaria 
said it always made it sound capi- 
talized. 

They shook hands. They got into 
the plane and shot straight up and 
the city was a blur beneath them. 
In less than a minute the little flier 
dropped down faster than any 
elevator and landed at Standiford. 

“Sergeant, Sub-Tribune Welcci 
needs a uniform. A — ” 

“Forty long,” Jay suggested, then 
colored. Tunic and a hundred years 
made a difference in his size. He 
went with the supply- sergeant, who 
gave him a correct fit the first time 
-^-times have changed, Jay grunted 
— and fitted him with a helmet on 
the second try. He felt a tremor as 
he buckled on the pellet gun. With 
the cloak flapping about his heels 
and the gun banging his leg and 
the helmet biting his ear he ran to 
the elevator and down to the room 
Kevin had designated. The Tribune 
and Commander DeVito and five 
or six other officers were standing 
around a table in the steel-walled 
underground room. 

Before them was a gigantic map. 
They looked up as Jay burst in. 

“This is The Man From 1954,” 
Ilaria said. There were hand-shakes 


all around that reminded Jay of 
fraternity rush. DeVito and one 
of the others wore wings. Jay won- 
dered if that were still a pilot’s 
insignia. 

The red X’s on the map, they 
told him, were places under at- 
tack. The blue ones were areas 
taken by the fast-moving rebels. 
He learned that the messenger- jet 
they’d sent to Rome — they were 
lost without their instantaneous 
push-button communications sys- 
tem — hadn’t made it. More had 
been sent. Meanwhile they were on 
their own. 

The nearest major battle was at 
Chicago, where Cocuzzi Flight 
Base was located. Ilaria despatched 
Commander DeVito and something 
like fifty jet fighters to Chicago. 
The other man was in charge of a 
group of B-90 Stratosonic bomb- 
ers. They lifted their fists in stiff- 
armed salute and left. 

“The rest of the ships will re- 
main here, ready for instant take- 
off. I’ll command interception. 
Sub-Tribute Rinaldi will com- 
mand the base in case I have to go 
up. 

“I can’t understand why we 
haven’t been jumped yet. We must 
assume they’ll attack Louisville be- 
cause of Standiford and the Time 
Building. They’ll also be interested 
in you, Jay.” 

B Y 2 : 00 THAT afternoon Louis- 
ville had not yet been at- 
tacked. Abruptly at 1:59 world 
communications went into opera- 
tion. Everyone turned on his tele- 
vision set, wondering if Caesar’s 
talk would go on as sceduled. 

It did. There was a screaming 

47 


AND GONE TOMORROW 



crowd before the Capitol. On the 
high balcony stood the Dictator. 
At his side stood Senator Chianti 
and around them were ringed 
Caesar’s Pretorian Guards. The 
city was nearly empty of field sol- 
diers. They had gone out to meet 
the insurgents. 

“People of the Republic of 
Rome.” The noise subsided as Cae- 
sar raised his hands and spoke. 

“You have all heard of the re- 
volt now in progress against us 
throughout the Empire.” 

Ilaria nodded at the Caesar’s 
psychologically clever use of the 
word us. 

“With your aid, my people, we 
can put a quick end to this trea- 
son. You have seen better than 
half a century of peaceful, success- 
ful government. These traitors and 
conspirators would attempt to over- 
throw our government and put an 
end to this peace . this Peace of 
Rome. 

“The world is now in a state of 
emergency. If you, my people, will 
bear with me through this period 
of crisis we will return to our world 
of peace and serenity once more.” 

Cheers. Wild applause. 

“They believe him,” Jay mur- 
mured. 

Ilaria looked at him. “Of course,” 
he said. 

“For a long time our Empire 
has remained . .” 

Caesar’s face stiffened. The deep- 
set, weary eyes blazed and widened. 
His hand reached out for the rail- 
ing. Then he stiffened again and 
was limp as the bursting pellet of 
sulphuric acid and potassium cy- 
anide took effect. 

Caius Julius Caesar Imperator V 
fell.

There was uproar and clamor 
and shrieking. 

Jay and Ilaria stood, staring, as 
the Pretorian Guards levelled their 
guns and became a solid, surround- 
ing wall. The T-V cameramen were 
getting the scene of the century. 
“Lamberti!” Ilaria bit out. 

The Pretorian Prefect, his hands 
outspread, stood on the balcony 
over Caesar’s body. The white cloak 
with Liberacione on it fluttered 
about him. A couple of Pretorians 
came out with an amplifier. 

“Friends, Romans, Countrymen,” 
said Farouk Lamberti. 

“ — every available long-range 
ship to Rome,” Ilaria’s brittle voice 
was hacking out orders. “Every 
one. Contact every other base 
while communications are still 
working!” 

“. a noble man. But not the 
man to govern Earth. No, not he 
nor his government. I bring you a 
new government. I, Farouk Lam- 
berti, long his best friend, have 
done this not to him, but for him. 
For you. The Earth was not meant 
to be governed by a system of — ” 
“Yes, I said bomb Rome.” 
Sub-Tribune Rinaldi smiled. 
“But Kevin, my friend, we can’t 
bomb Lamberti just when he’s 
getting a good start.” 

Jay looked up. Kevin Ilaria spun 
around. “What?” 

“Never trust old friends, Kevin. 
Colonel Di Orio didn’t. He sur- 
prised us in the Radio Room and 
we were forced to put him out of 
the way. Also remember this: all 
members of the Liberacione carry 
gamma pistols.” 

Rinaldi pulled out his gamma 
gun and shot Ilaria through the 
middle. 


ANDY OFFUT 



Jay was horrified. He forgot 
where he was and when he was 
and what he was doing. All he 
knew was that there was a cyanide 
gun at his hip and that this man 
had shot Ilaria. His gun came up 
and sputtered. 

The pellet caught Rinaldi just 
under the chin and burst. Rinaldi 
collapsed. 

“Had a — gamma gun — not . 
deadly. Slow-acting . radio- 
activity. Hardly . burned me. 
Come on — we’ve got to . get 
back to the — Time building.” 

“Oh, no we won’t. You’re hurt. 
We—” 

“Don’t argue. Sergeant! Saaar- 
guunt!” Ilaria gasped at the ex- 
ertion of shouting. The Centurion 
ran in. 

“We’ve got to — get to the — Time 
building.” 

“Rinaldi shot the Tribune. Rin- 
aldi was a traitor,” Jay explained 
rapidly. 

Uaria’s gun clicked and the 
Centurion shuddered back and fell 
through the door. The gamma 
burst from his pistol hit the wall. 

“God! Is everyone a traitor?” 
Jay demanded of the Universe. 

P EOPLE ARE easily swayed. It 
didn’t take them long to espouse 
the new cause. They were helped 
along in their decision by the Liber- 
acione planes hovering overhead 
with loads of KCN-H2S04 bombs. 
The whispering campaign Lam- 
berti had carefully started about 
germ warfare helped, too. Those 
who didn’t switch over rapidly 
were jumped by the new forces. 
Tribune Ilaria in Louisville, Ken- 
tucky, in America held out as long 

AND GONE TOMORROW 


as he could. Then the bombers 
came. And the Tribune fled to the 
Time building. 

The building shook. A table shiv- 
ered and a lamp shattered. A jet 
fighter flew close by the window 
and the Centurion watched fear- 
fully as it flipped on one delta 
wing and fired a tracer burst into 
a PR ship. The defender exploded 
in mid-air. 

Ilaria looked twenty years older 
than the man who had smiled and 
welcomed Jay Welch to 2054. He 
and a young scientist were prepar- 
ing the machine to send the man 
from 1954 back to his own time. 

“You’ll have to leave the gun 
here, Jay.” Ilaria winced as he 
bent over a set of dials. 

“I’d like to keep the uniform.” 

“All right. Does that do it, 
Doctor?” 

The scientist nodded. He looked 
at Jay. “It’s ready,” he said. 

“This switch sets everything in 
motion, doesn’t it?” Ilaria asked. 

“Yes. That’s the final control.” 

“Then . I’ll do it. I’d like . 
to say something to Jay before he 
leaves.” 

The scientist hesitated a moment, 
then shrugged and left. The Cen- 
turion went to the door. He was a 
young man and fanatically loyal. 

“You all right, Tribune?” 

Ilaria smiled. “I’m ... all right, 
Sergeant.” 

The Centurion nodded and left. 

“Sit ... sit down in that chair. 
Jay, and do your best to relax.” 

Jay sat down. A bomber roared 
overhead. There was a blast nearby. 

“What will you do now, Kevin?” 

Ilaria shrugged. “Fight ’em ’til 
they come in and we’re sunk. Then

COMMUNITY PROPERTY 


The first successful non-Terrestrial divorce case! Fame for 
Legal Eagle Jose Ob anion for his generalship of 
a three-sexed, five Venusian history-shattering precedent! 
Habits are habits but — alas! — on Venus they differ . 


BY ALFRED COPPEL 


O NE OF these days an embit- 
tered lawyer is going to write 
a text on the effects of spaceflight 
on the divorce laws. This writer will 
be a Terrie, about five ten, with blue 
eyes, black hair — turning grey very 
fast, and the unlikely name of 
Jose Weinberg Obanion III. Me. 

I remember very well the day I 
was graduated from law school; 
the day my father gave me his 
version of the Obanion credo. All- 
ways remember you live in a com- 
munity property state — 

That simple phrase has kept 
three generations of Obanions in 
the divorce trade. And only I have 
had cause to regret it. 

Basically, I suppose, my troubles 
began the day the Subversive Party 
swept the Joe Macs out of Con- 


gress and repealed the Alien Re- 
striction Act of 1998. That bit of 
log-rolling gave the franchise to 
almost all resident aliens and re- 
sulted in a situation virtually de- 
stroying the sanctity of divorce as 
an institution. 

I’m a Joe Mac myself — politi- 
cally, I mean. Obanions have been 
voting the Joe Mac Party Ticket 
for more than a hundred years. 
Red is our color. There are even 
family legends that say an Obanion 
was with the first Joe Mac when he 
became President of that old unit 
the Euse of Aay. 

We have to rely on legends, un- 
fortunately, because the Joe Mac 
Party traditionally fed their rally 
bonfires with books, and when they 
won the election and took over the 


56 





Euse of Aay they had a rally to 
end all rallies and somehow the 
Government Archives — books, you 
see, as well as punch cards and the 
like — got taken over by some very 
zealous Party men. The records 
were always rather incomplete after 
that. Only word of mouth infor- 
mation was available during that 
first Joe Mac Administration, and 
that can be sketchy. For example, 
the party color is red. All we know 
is that first Joe Macs had some- 
thing to do with red. You see how 
it goes. 

What I mean by all this, is that 
I can see the faults in my own 
Party. I’m no diehard. Nor am I 
a bad loser. The Subs won control 
of Congress by a landslide, so I 
guess the people wanted that sort 
of slipshod government. Only they 
should have been more careful, 
dammit, when they started tamper- 
ing with the laws. 

I’m not antispacegook, either. 
I have my framed Legal Eagle’s 
Oath right over my desk and I 
live up to it. And if Congress sees 
fit to make any Tmm, Dccck, or 
Harry a citizen of our great Com- 
monwealth — I account it my duty 
to see to it that they are not denied 
the benefits of our Terrestrial di- 
vorce laws. 

But sometimes it can be very 
trying. 

The new Sub Administration 
and their rash repeal of Joe Mac 
laws has had the effect of putting 
reverse English on the Obanion 
credo. 

Always remember you live in a 
community property state . 

That wonderful phrase that en- 
compasses so many great truths 
— that ringing statement that has 


made me rich and kept me a bache- 
lor — now means something else. 
Confusion. Work. Yes, and even 
spacegook depravity. 

1 SHOULD go back and pick up 
the story at the beginning be- 
fore I get too upset. 

My name, as I said before, is 
Jose Obanion. I’m a licensed Legal 
Eagle, specializing in divorce law 
— and doing well at it. I have a 
good office on the 150th floor of 
the Needle Building, a damned 
fine address and a comfortable lay- 
out, too. A whole room to myself, 
a private visor service to the 
Municipal Law Library, and a lap- 
desk for my secretary, Thais Orlof. 

On the day it began I was walk- 
ing to work from the tube way 
station and feeling rather pleased 
with myself. My income was high 
and steady, my protein ration ac- 
count was in good shape and I 
was doing my bit as a civilized 
Terrestrial. 

The morning was remarkably 
clear. You could make out the disc 
of the sun quite nicely through the 
smog, and there was a smogbow 
gleaming with carbon particles in 
the sky. I felt alert, expectant. 
Something BIG was going to hap- 
pen to me. I could feel it. 

Even in the go-to-work press of 
people on Montgomery Street, I 
didn’t get shocked once. That’s 
the way my luck was running. And 
three characters brushed against 
me and got nipped by my new 
Keep-A-Way. 

There’s been talk about making 
Keep- A- Ways illegal. Just the sort 
of infringement on personal liberty 
the Subversives are famous for. In- 


58 


ALFRED COPPEL 



consistent, too. They pass laws 
letting every spacegook in the 
universe come here to live and 
then talk about taking away one 
of the things that makes the crowd- 
ing bearable. 

I made a point of arriving at the 
office a little early, hoping to catch 
Thais in the act of coming in late. 
My secretary was a hard girl to 
dock, but I never stopped trying. 
It was a game we played. If she 
came in late, I would be justified 
in docking a protein credit off her 
pay for every thirty seconds of 
office time she wasted. So far I 
had managed to keep her pay low 
enough so she couldn’t think of 
leaving my employ — though she 
was earning a few prots on the side 
by acting as correspondent in di- 
vorce cases that couldn’t be settled 
by Collusion Court and actually 
had to be tried before a judge and 
jury. 

Thais and I were still haggling 
over the price of her services as 
part-time mistress, too. I couldn’t 
see giving her her asking price, 
which was half again the regular 
market price. Thais knew the value 
of a prot, all right. And of an erg, 
too. “Take care of the ergs,” she 
would say, looking at me meaning- 
fully, “and the prots will take care 
of themselves.” Thais was a devout 
Ben Franklinist and she was full 
of aphorisms like that. 

I settled myself into my Lowfer 
and glanced over the desk calen- 
dar. A full, profitable day ahead. 
Tremmy Jessup and his new fian- 
cee were coming in at 0900 to sign 
the premarital divorce settlement. 
A wise couple, I thought approv- 
ingly. Save a lot of trouble later. 
At 1100 Truncott vs Truncott and 


Truncott. A multiple divorce case 
with two women involved. Very 
lucrative sort of case. And then at 
1200 Gleda Warick was coming 
in to have me validate her Inter- 
locutory decree. A formality. But 
I hoped to take her to lunch at the 
Palace where they were advertising 
a five ounce portion of genuine 
horsemeat on their five prot din- 
ner. That sort of thing would im- 
press Gleda and I rather hoped 
for great things from her. Not only 
that, she was spending 25,000 prots 
yearly on divorces. No Franklinist, 
she. 

It still lacked a minute to the 
hour so I switched on the TV to 
catch Honest Pancho’s commercial. 
Pancho was my most active com- 
petitor and he cost me plenty, but 
I couldn’t suppress a grudging ad- 
miration of his enterprise. He had 
Lyra Yves doing his stuff for him, 
and anyone as socko as Lyra was 
dangerous. Sweetheart of the West- 
ern Hemisphere is the way she was 
billed, and her agent wasn’t ex- 
aggerating too much. 

Lyra was singing his come-on 
backed by a quartet humming a 
steady whap rhythm and doing a 
slow twitch. The lights were play- 
ing her daring costume big, accent- 
ing the fact that she had one breast 
almost covered. I frowned. How 
come the League of Decency let 
her get away with anything as sug- 
gestive as an opaque breast cover- 
ing. Pancho must have friends in 
the censor’s office. It was just an- 
other sign of the increasing de- 
generacy of our times. Soon en- 
tertainers would be appearing 
clothed from head to foot, exploit- 
ing the erotic stimulation of im- 
agination. 


COMMUNITY PROPERTY

“ — whap me slap me baby doll,” 
Lyra was singing. “Beat my head 
against the wall — lover, I don’t 
care at all at all — Whap! Honest 
Pancho’s on the ball!” 

Now the announcer cut in with 
his insinuating voice explaining 
how you could get your divorces 
quicker, cheaper and twice as 
funny at Honest Pancho’s Big 
Splitzmart in the Flatiron Building, 
as well as his Legal Eaglery just 
down from the County Courthouse. 
“ — yes, friends — TWO big loca- 
tions to serve you. Come in and 
see Honest Pancho today!” And 
then Lyra again: “Whap! Honest 
Pancho’s on the baaalll! WHAP!” 
She faded doing a sinuous twitch. 
I turned the TV off feeling a little 
worse than when I turned it on. 

Maybe, I thought, I’ve been too 
conservative. Maybe I’d, better get 
on the baaaalll, too. Or else. I 
shrugged the thought aside just as 
Thais slipped through the door — 
exactly on time. 

I watched her strip off her smog 
mask and cinder cape — on office 
time — and place them carefully in 
the sterilizer. She was very careful 
not to smear the paint that was 
most of what she wore. I tapped 
a NoKanse alight and inhaled 
deeply. “Good morning, Thais,” I 
said. 

“Whap!” she said in return. “I 
heard the TV all the way down 
the hall.” 

She pulled a Lowfer out of the 
wall and settled down with her lap- 
desk across her knees. The tip of 
one sandal was just brushing my 
shin. The office, unfortunately, 
could have been bigger, but with 
sixteen million people living in the 
city, space was rather costly even 

60 


for a man with a better than 
average prot account. 

“New paint?” I asked. 

She smiled brilliantly at me. 
“Nice of you to notice, boss.” She 
fumbled in the pockets of the belt 
around her naked, cerise-painted 
middle and took out her pad and 
stylus. “On time and ready for 
work,” she said. “A calorie saved 
is a calorie earned.” 

But now, somehow, I didn’t feel 
like attacking the day’s schedule. 
Not quite yet. Pancho’s commercial 
had disturbed me. “Thais,” I said. 
“I wonder if I’m — well, slowing 
down — ” 

“You, boss?” She fluffed her 
green- tinted hair provocatively and 
raised an eyebrow at me. “I 
wouldn’t say so.” 

“I don’t mean that way,” I said. 
“I mean professionally. I wonder 
if I shouldn’t seek wider horizons.” 
“New cases? Different cases? 
Give up divorce work? Oh, Boss!” 
“Not give it up, Thais. Not that. 
I couldn’t. Divorce is my life. 
Could a doctor give up healing? 
Could a Freudist give up lobotomy? 
No, I didn’t mean that. Frankly, 
I meant should I get more aggres- 
sive. Go out and get cases that 
would have a certain advertising 
value.” I didn’t want to say I didn’t 
feel like spending good protein on 
the sort of advertising Pancho and 
some of the other Legal Eagles, an 
unethical lot really, were buying. 
Besides, we Obanions have always 
been rather frugal. 

Thais’ face had come radiantly 
alive. “Oh, Joe — ” 

Now, that should have been a 
tip-off, because she never called me 
anything but boss. But I blundered 
right ahead because she was look- 

ALFRED COPPEL 



ing at me as though I were 
Clarence Darrow or somebody. 

“I have a case. A real case. If 
you would — if you only would take 
it, you’d be famous. More famous, 
that is. You’d be really famous.” 

I knew that Thais had some 
rather questionable friends, being 
a Franklinist and all. And I knew 
too that some of them were space- 
gooks. But The combination of 
Lyra singing for Pancho and the 
way Thais was looking at me made 
me get careless. 

“Tell me about it,” I said in my 
best legal manner. 

Her face fell. “Non-terrestrial.” 
And then she brightened. “But 
that’s the whole point. These peo- 
ple are citizens of Terra now . 
and think of it — you will be the 
very first Legal Eagle to represent 
them in a divorce case tried under 
our laws.” 

Under our laws . Oh, I should 
have known. But almost all law is 
precedent. And I was blinded by 
trying a case that would set a prec- 
edent instead of follow one. Heav- 
en help me, I said yes. 

“Where are these spacegooks 
from? And what time can they be 
in the office tomorrow?” 

“The Llagoe Islands on Venus,” 
she said excitedly. “And they can 
be here anytime you say.” 

“Okay, ten hundred sharp. What 
do they do and how many people 
are involved?” 

“They’re musicians. And, uh, 
there are three. And two corre- 
spondents.” She looked rather 
sheepishly at me as I raised my 
eyebrows and commented that even 
in this day and age of easy morality 
that was quite a number of ‘peo- 
ple’ to be involved in one divorce 

COMMUNITY PROPERTY 


case. Too many, in fact. 

“Well, they are subject to our 
laws,” she said doubtfully. 

“Indeed they are — thanks to a 
Subversive Congress.” I made a 
few notations on my desk pad. 
“Five of them, eh? A multiple mar- 
riage.” 

Thais’ voice was very low. “Well, 
no. Not exactly.” 

“What then?” 

She looked at me resignedly. 
“Three sexes,” she said. 


1 GAVE UP my luncheon with 
Gleda; as much as I should 
have liked to split a five prot pony 
steak with her. Instead of the Pal- 
ace, I went to the library. The 
public library. And read about Ve- 
nerians. What I found out was 
interesting — and a little frighten- 
ing, too. They were trisexual sym- 
biotes. And they were only remotely 
humanoid. 

There were very few of them on 
Terra — mainly because they rel- 
ished their own planet’s formalde- 
hyde atmosphere so much they 
were extremely reluctant to leave 
it. When they did, . and this 
really interested me — they generally 
became very wealthy as entertain- 
ers. They were accomplished mu- 
sicians and — of all things — tum- 
blers. 

For reasons that were only hinted 
at in the staid Encyclopedia Ter - 
restria, Venerians never entertained 
through the mass media such as 
the Livies or TV. Their stuff was 
limited to small, elite gatherings 
and it cost plenty. 

I thought of Gleda Warick and 
the party she was planning for 
later in the week. She’d asked me 

61 



to be alert for some good enter- 
tainment. Her friends were getting 
weary of games like Lizzie Borden 
and Clobber. Too many people 
getting hurt and all. Venerian tum- 
blers and minisingers would be just 
the thing. And it would assure 
solvency on the part of my clients- 
to-be. Part of the Legal Eagle’s 
Oath binds us to be concerned 
over our customer’s finances. 

The next morning, promptly at 
ten hundred, I was treated to the 
first sight of my clients. Their 
names didn’t transliterate into any- 
thing remotely pronounceable, so 
they were going by the names of 
Vivian, Jean and Clare Jones. 

After the first shock of seeing 
them wore off, I wrote on my pad: 
“Names used by humans of both 
genders. Significant.” 

They spoke English, the current 
lingua franca , with only a trace of 
a sibilant accent and they smelled 
of formaldehyde. 

I explained their rights under 
our divorce laws. Did the best I 
could, that is, not being quite sure 
who was married to whom and un- 
der what conditions their marriage 
functioned — if at all. Finally I 
said, “Tell me all about it.” 

Clare, who seemed to be the 
spokesman for the group and there- 
fore assumed, in my mind, a male 
gender, waved a boneless arm ex- 
citedly. “Had we known we were 
becoming subject to your Terres- 
trial laws by residing here we would 
never have remained. Our situa- 
tion is desperate.” 

I wrote on my pad: “Situation 
desperate.” 

“Yes,” hissed Vivian breathlessly. 
“Desperate.” 

I underlined desperate . 

62 


“We are, as you may know,” 
Clare continued giving Vivian a 
dark look, “Trisexual symbiotes. 
You do not have any analogous 
situation among mammals on 
Terra.” 

I glanced at Thais. “We sure 
haven’t,” she said with feeling. 
“But it sounds fabulous.” 

“It is not, I assure you,” Clare 
said running a four-fingered hand 
over his scaly crest in what I took 
to be a Venerian gesture of dis- 
traction. “We are not married as 
you people understand the term — ” 

“Not married,” I wrote, under- 
scoring it heavily. 

“But your law enforcement agen- 
cies insist that our symbiosis is 
analogous to marriage and there- 
fore subject to the regulations gov- 
erning that odd institution.” 

“What a bore,” Thais said help- 
fully. 

“Our problem is this. The three 
of us live in what you might 
roughly call a connubial state. We 
— what is your word? — co-inhab- 
it?— ” 

“That’s close,” I said. 

“We live together, that is. But 
more than eroticism is involved, 
I assure you.” 

“Of course.” Now it began to 
sound like most of my other cases 
and I could get my teeth into it. 

“You seem doubtful,” the Vene- 
rian said with a sharp-toothed 
frown. “Let me reiterate that what 
I say is so. The three of us have 
spent a ygith together — that is more 
than fourteen of your long years. 
But now the ygith is over and we 
•must seek another — how would 
you say it? — liaison?” 

“This is essential?” I asked. 
“Not just a whim?” It is, you see, 

ALFRED COPPEL 



the duty of a Legal Eagle to make 
every effort to save a marriage. In 
view of the circumstances, I felt 
that surely this was a marriage 
unique and therefore worth saving. 

“No whim,” declared Clare em- 
phatically. “Each ygith — or what 
you Terrestrials would call ‘mat- 
ing period 5 — we must uh — realign. 
If we do not, deleterious effects are 
certain. Our health goes bad. We 
may even die . 55 

“My friends , 55 I said, “you have 
very little to worry about. There 
are many similar cases here on 
Terra. Just last week, for example, 
a divorce was granted in the case 
of Nork vs. Nork wherein it was 
established that the plaintiff, Mr. 
Nork was allergic to Mrs. Nork. A 
simple case, and not the first of its 
kind. I myself tried one such case 
wherein a wife broke out in a rash 
whenever her husband sought to 
question her about the household 
expenses. A divorce was granted 
on the grounds of basic incompat- 
ibility . 55 

“Ah , 55 Clare said sadly. “If it 
were only that simple. Our two cor- 
respondents, Gail and Evelyn, are 
ready to enter the realignment. 
But — 55 and here the Venerian 
glared at the smallest of the trio. 
“this ungrateful wretch is un- 
willing to adjust to the changed cir- 
cumstances . 55 

Great tears formed in Jean’s 
slotted eyes. “How can you speak 
that way to me? After we’ve been 
through so much together ? 55 

“Now, now — 55 Thais, who has 
a very soft heart, patted Jean in an 
effort to make he she or it feel 
better. 

“Get to the point, Clare , 55 Vivian 
said testily. 

COMMUNITY PROPERTY 


“It is our understanding that 
property held in joint tenancy by 
two contesting parties in a divorce 
case may be distributed at the dis- 
cretion of the court . 55 
“That’s correct , 55 I said. 

“We contend, therefore, that 
Jean — 55 Clare pointed a scaly 
finger at the small Venerian, “is 
community property. Vivian’s and 
mine. We wish to make an agree- 
ment between us for the disposal 
of it — 55 

“Wait a minute ” I said, shocked. 
“I don’t think you understand the 
community property laws at all. 
Jean is, by definition, a person. A 
person cannot be considered prop- 
erty or chattel. Oh, no — 55 

The small Venerian made a face 
at them. “I told you you couldn’t 
get away with it,” she said. “This 
isn’t Venus, you know.” 

“On Venus you would be prop- 
erty,” declared Vivian. And to me, 
he — she — I still get confused about 
this — added: “My sex was eman- 
cipated thirty ygiths ago at home. 
But Jean’s is still considered — what 
did you call it? — chattel. No vote. 
No rights. Nothing but symbiosis.” 
“And Clare’s is still the — uh — 
dominant one?” I asked hesitantly. 

“That’s the myth that’s per- 
petrated,” Clare declared acidly. 
“We guths do most of the work, if 
that means anything.” 

I wrote on my pad: “Guths — 
breadwinners.” 

“And who — well, forgive my in- 
delicacy, but — 55 I shrugged mun- 
danely, “who bears the children?” 
“We all do,” the three Vene- 
rians chorused at once. 

Well, that’s the way the inter- 
view went. When the three Vener- 
ians finally left I had a rough out- 

63 



line for the brief on my pad. Be- 
sides the other comments, I had the

See Gleda. 

And see Gleda I did. I asked her 
if she could use not two, not three, 
but FIVE Venerian entertainers. 
She could and would. At 1,000 
prots a head for an hour’s enter- 
tainment. That took care of that 
much, anyway. I was, I felt, well 
on the road to making legal history. 

T HE FOLLOWING day I made 
arrangements to meet Jean 
alone in a little bistro down on the 
Embarcadero. I felt the salt water 
air would make her-it feel more 
co-operative. But on the way down 
I became aware of someone fol- 
lowing me. Cinder-caped and 
smog-masked, the tail I was 
dragging was inconspicuous 
enough, but I figured the thing 
about right. It was a Government 

64 


man. There could be only one an- 
swer. Honest Pancho had tipped 
the TBI that I was doing some- 
thing illegal or immoral. I was an 
active Joe Mac and that would be 
enough to put the Witch Hunt Di- 
vision of TBI on me even without 
Pancho getting wind of my deal- 
ings with the spacegooks. 

The gimmick would be, of 
course, that I was taking advan- 
tage of them, violating their rights 
under the V Amendment of the 
World Constitution. Pure false- 
hood, but my previous unwise po- 
litical affiliations put me under 
suspicion. 

I looked up through the smog, 
and sure enough. An Eyespy hung 
in the air just over my head — a 
tiny transmitter about as big as a 
half erg piece. If I spit on the side- 
walk, I thought, they’ll haul me 
in on the double. 

This was bad enough, but when 
and if I actually got the Venerians 
an interlocutory decree, I’d really 
have to watch it — and them, to 
see that nothing went wrong. The 
WH boys would have Pancho right 
at their shoulder watching for the 
slightest excuse to invalidate the 
decree. 

I could get used to the Eyespy, 
and I thought I could convince 
Jean. And above all, I had to keep 
the Venerians from anything like 
sexual activity during the two day 
period of the decree. Nothing — but 
nothing — will invalidate a decree 
quicker than that. And an invali- 
dated decree is very bad for a Legal 
Eagle’s reputation. 

I was, I thought darkly, getting 
into this thing deeper than I 
thought. But the rewards would be 
worth it. Think of it. To Legal Ea-

gle the first extraterrestrial divorce 
case in the history of the world! 
Holy Protein, I’d be in song and 
story. 

I made my way through the 
press of people on the slidewalks, 
my Keep- A- Way crackling a jolly 
tune, and the Eyespy hovering over 
my head. 

San Francisco is a wonderful 
place. Full of excitement and bus- 
tle. It’s a port of entry, for one 
thing, with starliners letting down 
into the Bay from all over the 
Solar System. On the Embarcadero 
there were Sandies from Mars, 
Rooks from the Jovian System — 
every sort of spacegook there is. 
Except Venerians. And mingled 
with the crowd I could make out 
the distinctive cinder capes of the 
Longshoremen — absolute rulers of 
the district. 

The bistro I was looking for was 
a floating platform moored to the 
ancient wharves, the ones that 
were left after the tidal wave 
caused by the bomb back in ’59. 
It was a nautilus type joint, most 
of it under water, called the Deep 
Six. 

An attendant took my cape and 
smog mask at the door and bowed 
me along to the maitre d\ 

“A table, sir?” He clapped his 
hands for a waiter. “May I order 
you something? A morphine syr- 
ette? Phenobarb? We have a par- 
ticularly fine aphrodisiac cocktail, 
sir. Or shall I just send the hostess 
to you and you can order later?” 

I eyed the line up of girls re- 
gretfully. They were all lovely, all 
almost fully clothed — and what 
flesh was exposed was completely 
unpainted. If Thais looked like 
that, I thought sadly, I wouldn’t 

COMMUNITY PROPERTY 


haggle about her price. But that 
was sheer depravity, I told myself 
sternly. That’s what comes of as- 
sociating with triple sexed space- 
gooks — I was here on business. Not 
pleasure. 

“I’m meeting someone,” I said. 
“A spaceg — a Venerian uh — lady. 
Miss Jones.” 

The maitre shrugged. “Every- 
one to his taste. The person you 
wish is at the corner table, sir. 
Near the window.” And sure 
enough, there was Jean, her crest 
waving agitatedly as she pressed 
her three nostrilled nose against 
the glass watching the sandsharks 
swimming gracefully among the 
mossy pilings outside. 

“Oh, Joe — just like home ” she 
hissed softly as I sat down. She 
was very strong of formaldehyde 
today, I thought. 

I didn’t quite know how to be- 
gin with her. I had to make her 
see reason, but she seemed to be 
unwilling to pay any attention to 
me at all except to comment that 
Clare and Vivian were very cruel 
to her. “And after I’ve given them 
the best ygith of my life.” Then 
she returned to her melancholy 
contemplation of the underseascape 
beyond the glass. 

I ordered an alkie-and-treacle 
and sipped it thoughtfully watch- 
ing Jean. An amber tear had 
formed in the outer corner of each 
slotted eye and was oozing gela- 
tinously down her pale green 
cheeks. 

It was like someone turning on 
a light in my brain. The answer 
was plain as day. Jean was home- 
sick. Miserable. And a miserable 
woman — or man — or — well, does 
it matter? — a miserable person was 

65 



always contrary. Remove the mis- 
ery and voila — gentle as a lamb. 

“Jean / 5 I said, “this case is 
important to me. You must help 
me get the decree. If you do — I’ll 
do something nice for you.” 

Over my head the Eyespy clucked 
reproachfully, but I ignored it. 

“Agree to the divorce. We can 
settle it in Collusion Court. And 
I’ll see to it you get passage back 
to Venus on the first available 
starliner. How’s that?” 

“Back to Venus? Back Home?” 
Her eyes gleamed redly. 

“That’s a promise,” I said. This 
would cost me plenty of prots, but 
the fame would be worth it. You 
can see how far gone I was on this 
case. 

“Just one thing,” I added 
thoughtfully. “What will become 
of the rest after the divorce? I 
mean, can two of each sex get 
along without a third? It sounds, 
well, almost unvenerian, if you 
know what I mean.” 

“The mating wouldn’t be a very 
high-type experience,” Jean said 
loftily, “without an ith — but it 
can take place. It’s just the sort of 
disgusting business you could ex- 
pect from people like Clare and 
Vivian. And those other two — well 
— you haven’t met them, but 
really — ” 

“Then you’ll do as I ask?” 

Jean waved her crest at me se- 
ductively. “Joe Obanion, you’re 
really very nice.” 

I backed away and swallowed 
hard as Jean laid a slick, webbed 
hand on my wrist. “How about 
it? Agreed?” 

“You know,” Jean said dreamily, 
“you remind me of a warth I 
used to know back home. He and 

66 


I and a really divine guth called 
Charlie had the most marvelous 
ygith together. I wonder if he re- 
members little me — ?” 

“I’m sure he does. How could 
she forget you?” I asked warily. 

Jean blinked her slotted eyes at 
me and her thin lips split into a 
tusky smile. “You say the nicest 
things, Joe. Yes, baby, I’ll do as 
you ask. I won’t contest the di- 
vorce.” 

“Jean,” I said with feeling, 
“you’ll never regret this.” 

And the Eyespy clucked dis- 
approvingly. Drop dead, Pancho, 
I thought. Drop dead twice. I had 
made it. 


LEDA WARICK’S house- 
mansion, really, lay sprawled 
over most of the Twin Peaks Area. 
From her Lunar Room you could 
see the whole of the city stretched 
out as if for inspection. To the 
east, the bay and the floating 
housing developments, wharves and 
night spots on and under the water. 
To the west the transocean high- 
ways, ribbons of plastic floating 
on the still Pacific. No one could 
afford to run ships now and almost 
all surface commerce was run over 
the highways in caravans of atomic 
trucks. To the Orient, to Alaska, to 
the Pacific islands. A steady string 
of lights moving at two hundred 
miles per hour. Rocket trails 
streaked the sky as starliners 
splashed into the bay and burbled 
to the surface, hissing and steam- 
ing. Market Street — all seven levels 
of it — ran from the base of the 
hills to the bay, a multilevel slid- 
way jammed with people. The 
view from Gleda’s place was mag- 

ALFRED COPPEL 




nificent because of the infra-red 
antismog windows she had installed 
in the Lunar Room at a cost, in- 
cidentally, of 100,000 prots. 

She had three rooms and a 
kitchenette. You entered her place 
and almost had an attack of agora- 
phobia. It was that big. 

The place was overrun with 
people. I’d brought Thais, of 
course, resplendent in red and 
silver paint. Lyra Yves appeared 
in a solid coat of gilt, with that 
one breast and her left arm 
sheathed in flexible vinyl. Thais 
nudged me. “Look at that. I think 
it’s disgusting. 55 

I did look. I couldn’t help my- 
self. That shiny vinyl caught the 
eye of every man in the room. 
“Depraved,” Thais sniffed. 

Honest Pancho came in with an 
older man who was pointed out to 
me as an ethnologist from the Uni- 
versity of California across the bay. 
A Professor Cripps. 

Pancho, dressed in his customary 
green and orange enamel and em- 
broidered cowboy boots, stumped 
across the room to give me the big 
hello. 

“Jose, my boy! Good to see you 
. He glanced up at the Eye- 
spy. “Trouble with the Witch 
Hunters? Tsk tsk — 55 

“As if you didn t know, 55 I 
snapped. 

“You think I’d do a thing like 
that to a friend ?” 

“Yes.” 

He grinned a big toothy smile 
at me. “As a matter of fact, you’re 
right. I hear you’ve got a big case. 
Non-terrie. Worth a lot to a Legal 
Eagle to be the first with a non- 
terrie case — 55 

“You’re too late, you vulture,” 
COMMUNITY PROPERTY 


I said. “Interlocutory decree 
granted.” I tapped my pouch. 
“Right here.” 

He shrugged. “Hope nothing 
happens to void it, old sport.” 

He winked at his silent compan- 
ion, the staid and seemingly dumb 
professor. He turned back to me. 
“Sorry. Should have introduced 
you. Prof Cripps — this is my friend 
and competitor, Jose Obanion.” 
“Pleased,” the Professor said, 
looking fearfully at the Govern- 
ment Eyespy over my head. His 
fingers went automatically to the 
engraved tablet he wore on a chain 
round his neck — a validated Loyal- 
ty Oath — as though to show the 
unseen TBI observers he wasn’t 
really a friend of this Joe Mac’s. 

“The Prof,” Honest Pancho 
said softly, “is a specialist in Ve- 
nerian ethnology. He’d like to meet 
your clients.” 

That gave me a start. “He’ll 
meet them. They’re going to sing 
tonight.” 

The Professor’s eyes widened. 
They looked shocked in his yellow 
painted face. “And dance?” 

I smirked happily at Pancho. 
“And dance. At 1,000 prots each.” 
If Pancho had any reply for 
that, I don’t know, for Gleda came 
in. She was wearing her hair blue 
and she wore a really striking pat- 
tern of iridescent blue paint with 
a double snake pattern coiling up 
her legs and torso. 

The party got under way very 
quickly. Gleda supplied the alkie 
and treacle and everyone nibbled 
their own synthetic protein out of 
their pouches. The combination 
soon had an hilarious effect on the 
gathering and a couple that I didn’t 
know, a boy and girl in particolored 

67 



green and blue, starting throwing 
small articles of furniture at the 
Eyespy over my head. 

Couldn’t hurt the Eye, of course, 
but I was kept pretty busy dodging. 
Then Thais suggested a quick game 
of Clobber. I must confess, not 
without satisfaction, that I cheated 
a little and peeked through the 
bandage so I could land a real lulu 
on Pancho’s long pointed nose. 

When Gleda stopped the bleed- 
ing and he was on his feet, some- 
one asked Lyra for a song and the 
cry was taken up by all. I caught a 
glimpse of the five Venerians’ round 
eyes peering at us out of the kitch- 
enette. But Gleda was saving them 
for the last — the piece de resis- 
tance. 

Lyra tore down a drapery and 
staggering a bit from two or three 
too many alkie-and-treacles, 
wrapped herself in it from head to 
foot. There was a shocked sort of 
gasp from the watchers. Professor 
Cripps turned red under his yellow 
paint. 

Gleda put a tape on the Musi- 
Kall and Lyra went into her act. 
I’ve never seen anything like it. 
Swaying like a cobra, her bare feet 
pounding out the beat on the 
plastic floor, she raised the tem- 
perature about ten degrees in that 
room. Her green painted lips 
twisted in agony, her eyes rolled 
in the chromatic mask of her face. 
An old folk tune — not the sort 
of thing she generally did. Some- 
thing that really tore at the heart- 
strings. A song that dated centuries 
back. History and the sense of our 
way of life lived in that room for 
a few short moments. Her voice 
was a blood-stirring trumpet — 

“Mairzy Doats and Lammsy 

68 


Doats 

And little kiddsie Divy — 

A Kiddlee Tivy Tooo Wouldn’t 
you — ?” 

When it was over, there was a 
breathless hush in the room. I won- 
dered where in the world Gleda 
had gotten that MusiKall tape — 
It had probably cost her plenty. 

There was only one thing, I 
thought, that could top that. 
“Gleda,” I said. “Now” Besides if 
the gooks didn’t earn their prots, 
what about my fee? I was already 
losing protein on this deal. Passage 
to Venus isn’t cheap. 

The Venerians trooped in and 
squatted on the floor while Gleda 
made the introductions. The room 
began to smell very like an em- 
balming room must smell. 

“May I present Clare, Vivian, 
Gail, Evelyn and little Jean. 
They’re going to sing for us.” 
Cheers from the guests. I glanced 
triumphantly at Pancho. The Pro- 
fessor seemed fascinated. “And,” 
added Gleda archly, “they may 
even tumble for us.” The Vene- 
rians looked at one another, tittered 
and flushed dark green. I was glad 
to see they were all on friendly 
terms with Jean. 

Clare struck an attitude, crest 
erect, and waited until everyone 
quit shuffling around. Presently, 
they sang. I think it was singing. 
Very cultural. Very esoteric. Also 
very noisy. It sounded rather like 
they were all in pain. 

After what seemed to me a very 
long time, they grew silent. There 
was a smattering of discontented 
applause. Gleda glared at me. I 
looked at Thais in dismay. “They 
also dance,” she said weakly. 

“Yes,” Pancho said. “Let’s see 

ALFRED COPPEL 



them dance!” 

“By all means/’ Gleda said, still 
eyeing me. 

“Dance, fellows,” I said hope- 
fully. 

Jean came over to me and 
whispered: “Are you sure it will 
be all right?” 

“Do you want to ruin me? 
Dance. Tumble. Do -something.” 

Jean shrugged and went back to 
where the Venerians squatted. “He 
says dance.” 

Evelyn and Gail stepped prop- 
erly, I should say primly, aside and 
the other three began stomping 
about. The rhythm was infectious. 
The movements became more 
heated and shouts of approval be- 
gan to ring out. 

“Dance, Gookie!” 

“ Whapperoonie ! ” 

“Go go go Gook!” 

I was delighted. So was every- 
one else. The dance grew more and 
more violent. There was a great 
deal of body contact in it. Evelyn 
and Gail looked longingly at the 
gyrating three, but kept out of it. 
I wondered why — never knowing 
that the Venerians are a very con- 
ventional people. 

Pancho was delighted. So was 
the Professor. In the middle of it, 
the prof raised his hands and made 
a signal. An earsplitting clangor 
broke from the Eye spy. 

The Venerians stopped. 

Everyone stared at the Eye. 

And at me. 

The Professor stepped forward 
and flipped his Loyalty Oath over, 
it opened like a poison-ring. The 
engraving inside said TBI Morals 
Division. 

“The Interlocutory Decree, if 
you please,” he commanded. 

COMMUNITY PROPERTY 


Stunned, I fished it out and 
handed it over. 

He glanced at it. “You realize of 
course that this is immediately in- 
validated.” 

“What?” I couldn’t believe my 
ears. 

“You know — as any Legal Eagle 
should know — that any restablish- 
ment of — uh — connubial rights ab- 
rogates an interlocutory.” 

“Of course I know that.” 

He glanced at Honest Pancho 
and smiled. There was triumph 
flashing between them like a shut- 
tlecock. “You Joe Macs never 
learn. The law is the law. What 
do you think your clients were just 
doing — and in front of a roomful 
of witnesses?” 

I felt my heart sink. “You 
mean — ?” 

Cripps nodded. 

“That?” I asked weakly. 

“That” he said, and tore up the 
paper. 

I watched my future as a Legal 
Eagle flutter down to the floor. 
“And I thought they were danc- 
ing,” Thais said sadly. 

Well, the story doesn’t end quite 
there. Gleda and I were arrested 
for running an obscene show. Gleda 
doesn’t speak to me anymore. Nor 
do any of the people who were 
there that night. Lyra and Gleda 
get all their divorces at Pancho’ s 
Splitzmart now. It took most of 
my prot account to bail us out and 
pay our fines. Thais is with me. 
We’re married and we haven’t a 
prot between us for a divorce, so 
we’ll just have to stay married. 

The Venerians came out all 

right though. They were deported.

George Dolan had four immediate problems:

the time -translator, a beautiful, out-of-this-world girl named 
Moirta, the gun runners and his life . A situation in which 

he finally triumphed . But what can you do with a victory 
that lies at the other end of a bridge 10,000 years long? 


BY RALPH WILLIAMS 


HE GUN RUNNERS were 
professionals, and except for 
one minor detail the operation had 
been very well planned. 

The middle twentieth century 
was chosen as a source of supply 
after a careful survey of all factors 
pro and con. The gun-runners did 
not want the mass weapons of their 
own day, they wanted selective 
weapons which could be used for 
private murder. In the mid-twen- 
tieth century, the level of tech- 
nology was such that well-made 
and reliable weapons were avail- 
able; and at the same time, social 
control was still sketchy enough to 


permit quiet procurement of such 
merchandise, if one knew how to 
go about it and was suitably fi- 
nanced. 

The gun runners, two men and 
a woman, knew how to go about it, 
and they were suitably financed. 
The profits in their business were 
commensurate with the risks — 
which were not small. 

In their world unauthorized time 
travel was highly illegal, because 
of certain possible undesirable 
effects on the total space-time con- 
tinuum, and was severely punished. 
Moreover, it was personally un- 
comfortable and dangerous.

They came from an old ingrow- 
ing world which had never reached 
the stars, where there were only 
men and their works, no blade of 
grass or micro-organism or spar- 
row which did not directly serve 
men. In their time, hereditary traits 
which had meant untimely and cer- 
tain death in earlier times had per- 
sisted and multiplied. Immunities 
and instincts which had fitted men 
to live with tigers and streptococci, 
and seek their food in the wilder- 
ness, had atrophied. 

The twentieth century was a 
dangerous environment for these 
people, more so perhaps than the 
Eocene would have been for homo 
sapiens. In preparation for their 
venture, it had been necessary for 
them to undergo a drastic and 
painful series of tests, inoculations, 
conditionings and plastic surgery. 

Unfortunately, it had not oc- 
curred to them that their time ma- 
chine might need similar protec- 
tion. The equipment was basically 
electronic, and the power leads 
were encased in a new insulation, 
a synthetic protein which in very 
thin films afforded a near perfect 
dielectric. It was also, as it hap- 
pened, an almost perfect culture 
medium for certain bacilli, non- 
existent in the sterile future, but 
healthy and thriving and full of 
appetite in the twentieth century. 

When the gun runners prepared 
to return to their own time with 
their cargo of contraband there 
were small flashes of fire, and 
smoke curled briefly from various 
parts of the equipment. Their tem- 
poral environment remained un- 
changed. 

The gun runners were not tech- 
nicians, they were specialists in 

72 


other fields. They pulled and prod- 
ded uncertainly here and there, 
pushed the buttons again. 

Nothing happened. 

The senior gun runner, a man 
who wore in this century the ap- 
pearance of a quiet, gray-haired 
professional man, and who wore in 
any century the habit of command, 
came to a decision. He spoke in 
their own language, a language 
time had pruned to telegraphic 
brevity: 

“If tamper, make worse. Elec- 
tronics technicians this era. Use.” 
The second man raised an eye- 
brow. “Knowledge adequate? Time 
travel not simple.” 

The older man shrugged. 
“Theory not simple, machine sim- 
ple. Savages clever fingers. Ade- 
quate stimulus, can solve.” 

“And after? Disposition?” 
“Displacement effect. Or — ” the 
senior gun runner sketched a quick 
gesture of pulling a trigger. 

The younger man nodded slow- 
ly, still dubious — which was proper, 
it was his function to be suspicious 
and questioning, as it was the 
other’s to command. “Stimulus?” 
“Profit. Curiosity. And . 
Moirta.” 

Both men turned and looked ap- 
praisingly at the woman, who had 
not yet entered the discussion. She 
was a very narrow specialist, with- 
in the wider specialty of gun-run- 
ning and murder. Now she moved 
her shoulders uneasily. “Displace- 
ment effect,” she suggested, “near 
limit. If caught — ” she made an 
unpleasantly suggestive spastic ges- 
ture. 

The chief gun runner shrugged 
again. “If caught,” he repeated the 
gesture she had made, “in any case. 

RALPH WILLIAMS 



No choice. Find technician now.” 


G EORGE DOLAN studied his 
visitors thoughtfully. 

“Well, actually,” he said, “our 
work is design, not repair. I sup- 
pose I could send a man out to look 
over your job and recommend a 
firm to handle it. Is that what you 
want?” 

“Mr. Dolan,” the gray-haired 
man said earnestly, “I am afraid 
you still misunderstand me. The 
work we wish done is small in scale, 
but very intricate and delicate, and 
highly confidential. We have inves- 
tigated your qualifications, and you 
are the man we want to handle it, 
you personally. We do not want you 
to mention this work to any other 
person — not even your wife.” 

“I don’t have a wife,” Dolan 
said. “That’s no problem.” He hesi- 
tated. “Do I need security clear- 
ance? That’ll take time.” 

“No security clearance. This is 
private work.” 

Dolan frowned. Private work, 
money no object, -very secret — there 
were implications to this offer 
which he did not like. 

On the other hand — 

His eye strayed to the young 
woman who sat quietly beside the 
man, silently exercising her spe- 
cialty. The plastic surgeons of her 
era had done a beautiful and near- 
ly perfect job on her body; but 
bone- deep, in ways an observant 
man could sense, she was still not 
a twentieth century woman. In a 
city full of women who made a pro- 
fession of being young and hand- 
some, she too was young and hand- 
some, but different. 

Dolan was an observant man, 

THE GUN RUNNERS 


and a curious one. 

He looked back at Brown. “If 
you could just give me some idea 
— ” he said tentatively. 

“The equipment, as I have said, 
is very intricate, and we are not 
technicians. We prefer that you 
make your own diagnosis.” 

Dolan pursed his lips uncertain- 
ly. He glanced again at the girl. 

“OK,” he said at last, “I’ll look 
at it. I can’t promise anything.” 

He punched a button on the 
desk intercom. “Betty, I’m going 
out to look at a job with Mr. Brown 
and Miss — uh — ” he glanced at the 
girl. 

“Jones,” the gray-haired man 
said. “Miss Jones.” 

“Oh, yes, excuse me.” Dolan 
smiled at the girl and drew a brief 
quirk of the lips in response. “ — 
with Mr. Brown and Miss Jones,” 
he continued. “Be back some time 
this afternoon.” 

“OK,” he said to his clients. 
“Let’s go see this intricate and 
delicate problem.” 

For reasons compatible with the 
profession of gun-running and the 
nature of time travel, the time 
translator had been located outside 
of urban limits — the city was to be 
rather systematically bombed in the 
near future — on a secluded and 
stable granite dike, within the shell 
of a frame cottage. Dolan observed 
all this without comment. 

They were met outside the cot- 
tage by a man about Dolan’s age. 

“This is my colleague, Mr. 
Smith,” Brown introduced him. 

Mr. Smith offered his hand. As 
he turned to lead them inside, 
Dolan noticed that the light sum- 
mer jacket Smith wore did not 

73 



drape well over the right hip 
pocket. He filed this fact also for 
future reference. 

“And here/’ Brown said, “is the 
machine we wish repaired.” 

In the center of the room was an 
orderly jumble of shiny black geo- 
metric solids, laced together with 
wires and bars of silver, the whole 
mounted on a polished ebony plat- 
form. It was handsome, in a bizarre 
sort of way; but certainly it did not 
look like any electronic gear Dolan 
had ever seen, and he had seen al- 
most all there was, at one time or 
another. 

He studied it carefully, turning 
it this way and that in his mind, 
trying to find some familiar feature 
to grasp it by. There was none. 

“Well,” he asked skeptically, 
“what is it? What does it do?” 

Brown shook his head. “The 
purpose of the machine must re- 
main secret,” he said firmly. “We 
think the trouble may be super- 
ficial, some minor thing an expert 
could quickly repair; and we wish 
you to work on it from that view- 
point, without inquiring into its 
purpose.” 

“I see,” Dolan said noncommit- 
tally. The whole business was 
screwy. For two cents, he thought — 

He glanced at the girl. She sat 
quietly on a chair, hands folded 
demurely in her lap, watching him, 
practising her specialty. Well, may- 
be, he thought, it wouldn’t hurt to 
look, as long as he was here any- 
way. 

He walked over to the equipment 
and bent to examine it. The silver 
conductors seemed to be uninsu- 
lated, although in places they were 
closely paired. He frowned and 
scratched tentatively at one with 

74 


his fingernail. The metal showed 
bright. There was a slight tarnish, 
that was all, no insulation. 

He noticed something else. Back 
of the equipment, at an angle un- 
noticeable from the side he had 
first approached, were several cut 
and dangling wires, some of which 
had been partially replaced by 
quite ordinary high tension cable. 
Spread about on the floor were 
lengths and coils of wire. 

“You’ve been working on it 
yourselves?” he asked Brown. 

“No, no. As I told you, we are 
not technicians. Before we con- 
tacted you, we had already tried 
another man. He proved unsatis- 
factory. We, uh, paid him off and 
sought a better qualified person.” 

“Unsatisfactory, eh? Umm, I 
see.” Dolan’s eyes moved thought- 
fully to Smith, who lounged care- 
lessly just inside the door. The coat 
now hung smoothly, it was only 
when Smith moved that the hint 
of a bulge showed. 

Dolan was a curious man, but 
also a prudent and thoughtful one. 
He decided he did not want this 
job, it was time to get out. “I’ll 
have to go back for some equip- 
ment,” he said casually. “Gan you 
drive me in?” 

He knew immediately that it was 
not going over. Brown frowned and 
sucked thoughtfully at his lower 
lip. 

“If you could make a list,” 
Brown offered, “I could get it for 
you. You could then be making a 
preliminary survey while I am 
gone. There is a question of time 
involved, we wish these repairs 
made as quickly as possible.” 

“Well . I’m not sure . .” 

“Miss Jones,” Brown said per- 

RALPH WILLIAMS 



suasively, “is as well-versed as any 
of us in the operation of the equip- 
ment. She could answer any ques- 
tions you might have.” 

The girl smiled and nodded. 
Smith, lounging by the door, casual- 
ly moved his hand to his belt, 
sweeping back his unbuttoned 
jacket slightly. Brown stood wait- 
ing. 

Dolan studied them silently for 
a moment. They couldn’t force him 
to take the job, he could simply 
turn them down and walk out. Or 
could he? For some reason he did 
not quite understand, he was just 
a little reluctant to test the idea. 

“OK,” he said shortly. He took 
his notebook and began to scribble 
a list of equipment on a blank 
page. A message, he wondered, like 
they do it in the movies? A request, 
maybe, for some outrageous piece 
of equipment that would tip off the 
boys in the shop? No good, they 
weren’t that smart, and for that 
matter neither was he. Besides, 
what did he really know? Nothing, 
except that he just didn’t want this 
job very much. 

He tore the page out of the note- 
book and handed it to Brown. 
Brown slipped it in his pocket and 
went out. 

Dolan turned to the girl. “OK, 
Miss Jones,” he said. “Now let’s 
see what we can figure out about 
this gear.” He strolled completely 
around it, eyeing it from all sides. 

“Well . he said dubiously. 
“First, I guess, control. How do 
you start it up, make it go?” 

“We push these buttons, in this 
sequence,” the girl told him. Shfe 
moved her fingers lightly over a 
series of studs set in a small cube. 

“OK, push ’em. Let’s see what 

THE GUN RUNNERS 


happens.” 

“Nothing happens,” the girl said. 
“The machine just doesn’t work.” 

“Well, then, what’s supposed to 
happen?” 

The girl looked unhappy. “I’m 
sorry,” she said finally, “didn’t Mr. 
Brown say you weren’t to ask such 
questions?” 

“OK,” Dolan said resignedly, 
“we’ll let that go then. How about 
this : What indications do you have 
when it is operating normally? Any- 
thing light up, move, buzz, hum, 
spin around?” 

The girl frowned thoughtfully 
and shook her head. “Nothing 
lights up, moves, buzzes, hums, 
spins around. When the machine 
works, it . well, it just works, and 
that’s all.” She studied him with 
troubled eyes. “You are an expert, 
it seems to me an expert should be 
able to look at a machine and see 
what parts are faulty, isn’t that 
true? Why must you know what 
the machine does?” 

Dolan leaned back against the 
machine and lit a cigarette. He 
squinted thoughtfully at her 
through the smoke. Well, what the 
hell, with looks like that, why 
should she need brains? 

“Miss Jones,” he said patiently, 
“I gather that you aren’t a tech- 
nical person?” 

“Not with machines, no.” 

It was an odd sort of answer. 
Did it imply that she had a tech- 
nical knowledge of something other 
than machines? Dolan considered 
it briefly and decided to pass it up 
for now. 

“I am a technically trained per- 
son,” he said, “an expert as you 
say; and I can tell you this: ma- 
chinery, electronic gear, anything 

75 



like that, is built to do a specific 
job. Before you can design, build, 
or repair such equipment, the very 
first thing you have to know is: 
what do you want it to do? For all I 
know, this machine here may just 
be an overgrown coffee percolator. 
Now, suppose I go ahead and fix 
it with that in mind, and when I 
get done it makes beautiful coffee, 
but it turn out you wanted all along 
for it to get television programs, 
you’re going to be terribly disap- 
pointed. You see now why I have 
to know what it does?” 

The girl nodded seriously. “Yes,” 
she admitted, “I can see that; but 
I’m sorry, I still cannot tell you the 
purpose of the machine.” She 
glanced uncertainly at Smith. He 
shook his head minutely. “Per- 
haps,” she said, “when Mr. Brown 
returns — ” 

B ROWN, however, did not con- 
vince easy. 

Dolan puffed angrily at a ciga- 
rette, while Brown and the girl 
watched him impassively. 

“Damn it,” he said, “it just won’t 
work like this, that’s all there is to 
it.” He kicked savagely at the base 
of the machine. “All I’m doing is 
chasing my tail in circles. I know 
what part of the trouble is now, 
somehow you’ve lost the insulation 
on your conductors — burned up, 
evaporated, blew away, God knows 
what. Anyway, it’s gone. But I can’t 
just spray some gunk back on and 
have it work like new, we just 
haven’t got that kind of insulation. 
Where’ d you get that stuff, anyway. 
Can’t you get some more?” 

“It was specially made for us,” 
Brown told him. “We cannot get 

76 


more at . present.” 

“I see.” There had been a very 
slight accent on the “present”. Did 
it mean anything? And if so, what? 
“Well, I can rewire it for you, use 
standard stuff, it won’t look pretty 
but it might work, only what should 
I use? I don’t know what it needs 
— high voltage cable, or bell wire; 
shielded or open. I’ve got to know 
what you’ve got in these black boxes 
here — ” he pounded gently on one, 
“before I know what to feed them.” 
He snapped his cigarette into a 
corner, gloomily watched the smoke 
curl up from it for a moment, then 
walked over and stepped heavily on 
it. “So that’s it,” he said definitely. 
“I’ve been fooling with this thing 
all day, and that’s just exactly as 
far as I can go. It’s up to you peo- 
ple, you can give me the dope, I 
can’t promise anything even then, 
except just to try; or you might as 
well pay me off. I can hang around 
here and put in more time, but you 
won’t be getting anything out of 
it.” 

Brown studied his fingernails ab- 
sently. “Perhaps you are right,” he 
said slowly, “However, I cannot act 
without consulting with Mr. Smith, 
and he has gone into town to get 
some food for you, I am sure you 
must be hungry. When he returns, 
I will let you know our decision.” 
“OK.” Dolan mopped at his face 
with his handkerchief. “God, it’s 
hot as an oven in this shack,” he 
said. Miss Jones smiled in sym- 
pathy, though she looked cool 
enough. 

“Come on, Miss Jones, let’s get 
outside and cool off a bit.” 

“I think that would be nice,” she 
agreed. 

It was just turning dusk outside, 

RALPH WILLIAMS 



and there was an agreeable breeze 
coming up the valley. They walked 
over and sat down on a rocky ledge. 

“Tell me, Miss Jones,” he said 
suddenly, “do you like it here?” 
“It’s very pretty,” she said. She 
looked out toward the ridge with 
the sunset colors fading behind it. 
“Much nicer than the city.” 

“No, no,” he said brusquely, 
“that’s not what I mean. I mean, 
do you like it here , in our world?” 
“I don’t think I understand you.” 
“I mean here, now, on this 
planet, in this time. Do you like it 
as well as your own . place?” 
She stared up at him with wide 
puzzled eyes. “My own place? 
What other planet or time do you 
think I might know?” 

“I don’t know, Miss Jones, I just 
. He was not quite sure exactly 
what he had been driving at, him- 
self. “Forget it. Tust a stupid idea.” 
He leaned back and let his eye fol- 
low the shadows up the valley. A 
faint whiff of perfume reached him. 

“Miss Jones,” he said. “That’s 
rather an awkward thing to call 
you. Do you have a first name?” 
“Jane Jones, naturally,” she said, 
and smiled. “What else?” 

“No good,” he said firmly. “I 
might call you Mary, that’s a nice 
anonymous tag, and sounds better 
too ... or you could tell me your 
real name, just the first name, that 
wouldn’t give much away.” 

She considered silently. “Moirta,” 
she said finally. “My name is 
Moirta.” She accented the sylla- 
bles evenly. 

“Moirta,” he repeated. “Moir- 
ta.” He rolled the “r” slightly, as 
she had done. “That’s much better, 
it fits you now, Moirta, and it fits 
the cool shades of evenin’.” 


He looked down at her. 

“Moirta,” he said soberly. “It’s 
a lovely name, truly.” 

He leaned forward and kissed 
her. Her lips met his, not coldly, 
and not demandingly or fiercely, 
but gently and firmly, in the exact 
measure he desired. He put his 
arms about her, and she came into 
them, supple but not limp, as a 
beautifully trained dancer follows 
a lead. For a very long moment 
they remained thus, lip to lip and 
breast to breast, the yearning and 
response in each rising in swift 
even balance. 

And then Brown opened the 
door, casting a shaft of light past 
them in the dusk. 

“Oh, Moirta,” he called. “Are 
you there? Could you come here 
a moment, please — ” 

The two male gun runners had 
stepped outside the cottage while 
Moirta served Dolan his dinner. 
They found the smells and sounds 
of summer night, the darkness it- 
self — in their world there was no 
darkness except in closed rooms — 
disturbing, but preferable to watch- 
ing and hearing Dolan eat. 

“For primitive, natural,” the 
senior gun-runner said, “but — ” 
he winced, “teeth!” 

“Gnawing!” the other agreed. 
He clicked his own non-functional 
dentures experimentally, examined 
his fingers with fascinated revulsion. 
Tender flesh, white teeth — ugh! 

“Moirta,” he said thoughtfully, 
“seems not to mind.” 

The senior gun runner cringed 
as a bat fluttered by. “Her specialty, 
he said absently, “not to mind.” 
He strained his eyes to see into the 
darkness. Was that a mouse rustling 

77 


THE GUN RUNNERS 



in the grass? Or worse yet, a 
snake? 

“Progress?” the younger man 
asked. 

“Motivation set. Next, focus on 
problem. Pressure.” It was some- 
thing, something small and alive, 
coming toward him. “Move nearer 
door,” he said abruptly. “Light.” 

“Mr. Smith and I have discussed 
the matter,” Brown said, “and we 
have decided to be completely 
frank with you.” He paused, watch- 
ing Dolan. “The machine is a time 
translator,” he said. 

Dolan looked back at him, poker- 
faced. “So?” 

Brown frowned slightly. Perhaps 
he had expected more of a reaction. 
“We are from a time very far in 
your future,” he continued. “The 
machine has the apparent effect of 
transferring our physical bodies to 
this age. I say ‘apparent’ effect, 
because the mechanism of this 
time translation is not fully under- 
stood. There are certain anomalies, 
the displacement effect for example 
— but that is immaterial, for all 
practical purposes we can move at 
will to and from any time in our 
past, though not into our future — 
when the machine is working. 

“Naturally, such time travel must 
be kept secret, if it were not, sev- 
eral undesirable consequences 
might arise. It is very closely reg- 
ulated, and may be used only for 
bona fide historical research by 
responsible persons.” 

He looked inquiringly at Dolan. 
“I am not really sure I can tell you 
much more about the machine, I 
am not a technician, as you know. 
Does what I have told you help 
any?” 

78 


“I don’t know,” Dolan said. “Let 
me think about it a minute.” He 
was not really much surprised at 
the disclosure. In terms of the 
technology he knew, the machine 
was almost completely meaning- 
less. From the beginning, there had 
only been two possibilities — either 
it was the product of an alien cul- 
ture, or it was an elaborate hoax. 
He had already decided it was not 
a hoax. He had not, he realized, 
allowed himself to explore fully 
the implications of the other pos- 
sibility. He did so now, and some 
of the implications were — in- 
triguing. 

Historical research, eh? Well, 
maybe. He would reserve judgment 
on that. 

But a time machine? There was 
no such thing. And yet, if there 
were — 

He looked at the jumble of 
equipment speculatively. 

“I still don’t know how a time 
machine might work,” he said 
finally. “Do you have any sort of 
handbook, operating manual, any- 
thing like that? Or do they have 
such things in your time?” 

“Operating manual? I don’t 
think so. There are some pictures 
— ” Brown stepped over to the 
machine and touched a large flat- 
tened sphere which grew out of the 
base. “This is the power unit. If 
you press these studs, various pic- 
tures — ‘schematics’, I believe you 
would call them — are projected on 
the surface. Is that what you 
want?” 

“That sounds like it,” Dolan said. 
“But I did press those studs. Noth- 
ing happened.” 

“That is because the power unit 
is not operating. It does not come 

RALPH WILLIAMS 



on* as it should, when we press this 
button.” He indicated a stud on the 
cubicle control unit. “That, I sup- 
pose, is one of the major things 
wrong with the machine.” 

“Ummm, yeah, I see,” Dolan 
said. He squatted and examined 
the power unit more closely. “One 
of these pairs now — ” he traced 
them with his finger up to the 
control unit, “must be the control 
pair.” He took a piece of chalk 
and began numbering the terminals 
rapidly. 

“Now,” he said, “if the control 
pair is shorted, the power should 
be on, but there must be overload 
protection of some kind, that’s 
probably kicked out, so let’s just cut 
all this junk loose and then short 
the possible control pairs one at a 
time, see what happens then.” 

He reached for a pair of side- 
cutters. The three gun-runners 
looked at each other. Brown nodded 
slightly. They moved quickly back 
out of Dolan’s way. 

“OK,” Dolan said half an hour 
later. “We’ve got the power unit 
perking, and we’ve got the pictures. 
Now what do they mean? This 
block interwiring diagram now, it 
seems to be what I’m looking for, 
but I can’t read the tags they’ve 
got on it. You know which block 
in the diagram corresponds to which 
piece of equipment?” 

Brown studied the luminous 
white lines against the black pol- 
ished background. He put a well- 
manicured finger on one square. 
“According to the lettering,” he 
said, “this is the control unity, the 
small cube at the top with the but- 
tons. This other, I do not know, 
it says: ‘temporal re-integrator.’ I 

THE GUN RUNNERS 


do not know what that might be.” 

Dolan frowned doubtfully. 
“ ‘Temporal re-integrator’,” he re- 
peated. “Could be anything. What 
do the others say?” Among the 
litter the first electrician had left, 
there was a short length of lead- 
shielded two-conductor number 14 
wire. He picked it up and began 
to run it absently through his fin- 
gers, straightening it. Someone had 
apparently amused themselves by 
clipping idly at it with a pair of 
side-cutters, it was irregularly 
nicked along its length. 

“This,” Brown continued, “is 
something called a ‘selective res- 
onator’, and this, well, the term 
does not translate, it is a — ” he 
pronounced carefully, as if un- 
familiar with the word, “ ‘bractor- 
quatic’ — ” 

There was something peculiar 
about the indentations in the wire, 
Dolan realized, a pattern — He 
pulled it unobtrusively through his 
fingers again, letting his thumb- 
nail run over the nicks. It was 
Morse: K-I-T-T-E . kitten? . 
no, it must be American Morse 
. K-I-L-L-E-R . killers hs 
end rvr rd 

Killers in the house at the end 
of River Road. 

This was the house at the end 
of River Road. 

Brown had stopped speaking and 
was looking at him questioningly. 

“Uh, yeah,” Dolan said hastily. 
“Well, that still doesn’t tell me too 
much.” He carefully rolled the 
length of wire and hung it on a 
projecting piece of the time trans- 
lator. His hands were damp, and 
he was sure he was moving awk- 
wardly and unnaturally. Dolan was 
not an easily flustered person, but 

79 



things were coming a little fast — 
mysterious aliens, time machines, 
and now — murder, or hint of it. 
He needed time to think. 

“It’s getting pretty late,” he said, 
hoping his voice sounded natural. 
“Let’s just knock off for now, I’ll 
study it over, maybe I’ll have some- 
thing figured by tomorrow.” 
Historical research, huh? Some 
professors all right, this bunch — 
The thing to do was to stall, not 
let them know he suspected any- 
thing. 

“I tell you,” he said casually, 
“do you have some place I could 
bed down here? Save me a trip 
into town and 'back.” 

Was it his imagination, or did 
Brown relax slightly? 

“Why, yes, we do have a spare 
cot in Mr. Smith’s room,” Brown 
$aid. “Would that be good 
enough?” 

“Sounds fine,” Dolan said. He 
snapped the lid of his tool-box 
shut. “Let’s go see what it looks 
like.” 


HE TWO MALE gun runners 
held a council of war while 
Dolan was eating his breakfast. 

“Subject’s attention diverted,” 
the senior gun runner said. “Un- 
known factor. Annoying.” 

Smith clucked his tongue in sym- 
pathy. He thought for a moment. 
“Raise threshold to override?” he 
suggested. 

“Must. Moirta.” 

Smith nodded and went out. He 
returned in a moment with the 
female gun runner. Brown ex- 
plained the problem to her in the 
sarfie few words he had used to 
Smith. 

80 


She shrugged. She did not bother 
to practise her specialty on her 
colleagues — they were, for one 
thing, almost immune, they had 
grown up in a civilization where 
her specialty was over-crowded. 
For another, in the nature of her 
specialty, she found it hard to 
concentrate on more than one sub- 
ject at a time. “Doing best,” she 
said indifferently. 

Brown studied her shrewdly. 
“Supplies short,” he said mildly. 
“One-half larger than one-third. 
Each must pay way.” 

His voice was mild, but Moirta 
understood the threat quite clearly. 
“Suggestions?” she asked coldly. 

Brown nodded equably — he was 
used to temperament in this mem- 
ber of his team — and told her what 
he wanted her to do. She would 
obey, he knew. She would also 
double-cross him, if the occasion 
offered; but he did not intend that 
the occasion should offer. 

There was a foot-path leading up 
the ridge back of the cabin. Dolan 
did not ordinarily feel the need of 
an after-breakfast stroll, but today 
he was looking for something. He 
was not quite sure what it would 
be, but he thought he would rec- 
ognize it if he saw it. He walked 
slowly up the foot-path, letting his 
eyes roam. Perhaps fifty yards from 
the cottage, the grass was trampled 
and the brush bent where someone 
had left the path. 

This might be it. 

He followed the trampled trail 
off the path, searching carefully 
now. Three or four steps along it, 
he found what he had been look- 
ing for — two empty .45 caliber 
cartridges lying in the grass. 

RALPH WILLIAMS 




He picked them up and juggled 
them in his hand, looking specu- 
latively about. Angling off to the 
left was an opening in the under- 
growth. 

He walked that way and found 
himself standing on the lip of a 
sharply eroded gully. Someone or 
something had kicked the bank 
down recently, there was a great 
pile of new earth in the bottom of 
the gully. He kicked around in the 
leaves and mold at his feet. There 
was a dark crusted substance on 
the leaves. 

The door of the cottage slammed. 
He slipped the empty cartridges 
in his pocket and stepped hastily 
back to the path, listening. 

Were those footsteps hurrying 
toward him? 

He began to stroll slowly back 
toward the cottage. Around the 
first turn he met Moirta. 

The girl now, he thought, where 
does she really fit? Possible ally? 
Enemy? Or neutral? 

She came up to him a little 
breathless and took his hand. “Were 
you going back to the house?” she 
asked. 

“Not specially. Just walking 
around.” 

“Let’s not go back just yet, then,” 
she said. They turned and walked 
slowly back up the path, hand-in- 
hand. After a while they came out 
on an open shoulder from which 
they could look down, catching 
glimpses of the path they had 
climbed here and there, and at its 
end the cottage. They sat down 
close together, leaning back against 
a large tree, not speaking at first. 

After a while the girl sighed. “I 
shall feel verv sorry when we leave 
this time,” she said. 

THE GUN RUNNERS 


“Me, too.” He kissed her. 

After a moment she pulled away 
and looked at him searchingly. 
“There is something bothering 
you?” she asked. She flushed a lit- 
tle. “That was not very . ardent.” 
Dolan looked away, feeling 
foolish. “I guess not,” he said. 

She took his hand and squeezed 
it. “Poor George. It must be very 
confusing for you. Can I help?” 
Perhaps she could, he thought. 
“Look here,” he said cautiously, 
“what happens when I get this 
thing fixed, if I do? You folks go 
on back to your own time, I sup- 
pose, but what happens to me?” 
She hesitated. “I don’t think 
I understand,” she said. “Mr. 
Brown pays you for your work, I 
suppose, and you stay here, that’s 
all. Should there be more?” 

Dolan smiled grimly. “Like the 
first technician, huh?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I mean, Brown pays me, and I 
stay here, like the first technician.” 
He took his hand out of his pocket 
with the two empty cartridge cases 
in it and rolled them gently back 
and forth in his open palm. 

Moirta stared at them fascinated. 
“Oh,” she said faintly, “I didn’t 
know. I thought ... I didn’t 
know . .” 

“Well, you know now,” he said. 
“And your job is to keep me 
cheered up and plugging away at 
the job until payday comes. Right?” 
“No,” she said. “Oh, no. Please, 
George. They wouldn’t do that . 
that is, I don’t think ... it’s so 
unnecessary.” 

“Unnecessary?” 

“Yes. You see — I shouldn’t tell 
you this, but I can’t have you think- 
ing . you see, after we are gone, 

81 



you will forget all this. Why should 
they kill you when there’s no 
reason?” 

She did not seem very strongly 
convinced herself, Dolan thought. 

“How do you mean, I’ll forget 
it? You mean they’ll hypnotize me, 
something like that?” 

She shook her head. “No, they 
won’t have to do anything. It’s 
the displacement effect. You see, 
we are not really here, in a way, 
it is a sort of illusion, but more real 
for us than for you. When we re- 
turn to our own time, we will re- 
member all that happened, but you 
will remember nothing, since the 
translator does not really exist in 
your time. You will just forget, it 
will be as if none of this had ever 
happened, as if you had never met 
me, never heard of a ‘time-trans- 
lator’.” 

It sounded plausible, in a way, 
but there was a flaw in the logic. 

“If everybody in this time for- 
gets, why so much to-do about 
secrecy? Won’t anyone else I tell 
forget too?” 

“There is a limit to the possible 
displacement. If the limit is ex- 
ceeded, according to the Alwyn 
hypothesis the continuum itself may 
be altered, and one of the ways 
in which it might change would 
be to eliminate the irritant — in 
other words, all of us concerned 
directly.” 

“I see. So they figured two of us 
put too much of a strain on the dis- 
placement, that’s why they killed 
this other joker — what was his 
name, anyway?” 

“Nelson. Perhaps,” she said un- 
certainly, “that might be it.” 

“And maybe they figure even 
one is too much strain, better to be 

82 


safe than sorry, huh?” 

“No, I don’t think so. Killing 
requires even more displacement 
than . loss of memory. Really, I 
don’t understand it, you see, I am 
just a sort of employee, they don’t 
confide in me. If they knew I had 
been talking to you about these 
things like this — ” she shuddered 
and smiled wryly. “Perhaps I too 
know too much, perhaps I should 
be worrying about the pros and 
cons of various types of displace- 
ment for myself.” 

Dolan looked at her thought- 
fully. “This displacement thing,” 
he said gently, “I’ll forget you too?” 
She nodded. “You will forget 
me. But I will remember you — 
for a long time, I am afraid.” 

He frowned and kicked at a tuft 
of sod. “I don’t want to forget you. 
Do you have to leave with the 
others? Couldn’t you stay? For a 
little while anyway? You haven’t 
really had a good chance to see our 
world yet.” 

“No. They would never trust me 
out of their control. If I refused 
to go . well . .” she shrugged. 

“And I don’t suppose I could go 
back with you to your world, spend 
some time there, either?” 

“No, that would be to travel into 
your own future, which cannot be 
done.” 

“I see.” Dolan leaned back 
against the tree, thinking. 

“Well, there’s one thing sure,” 
he said. “If the machine can’t be 
fixed, it can’t be fixed, there isn’t 
much they can do about it. You may 
all stay in this time yet.” 

She shook her head gently. “Not 
all. At least, not all alive. There 
would be no displacement, and the 
only hope they would have to avoid 

RALPH WILLIAMS 



the Alwyn action would be to pre- 
serve absolute secrecy. You have a 
saying, I believe: ‘dead men — 5 ” 
She hesitated. “Even if you and I 
could find a way to escape, even 
if they told me I might leave, I 
could not trust them. They are 
very dangerous men. As long as we 
and they are both in this time, there 
would be no safety for me, nor for 
you.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” Dolan 
said reluctantly. He looked down 
at her searchingly. “What do you 
want to do?” he asked. “Do you 
want to stay with me, or do you 
want me to forget you?” 

“I want to be with you,” she 
said softly. “Always.” 

“And I, with you,” he said. He 
bent his head toward hers. 

Below, the door of the cottage 
opened. Smith’s figure appeared. 
He glanced around and then came 
plodding up the path. 

Moirta pulled away and got to 
her feet. “We might as well start 
back, I suppose,” she said un- 
enthusiastically. 

“Let’s go back in the woods, he 
won’t find us there.” 

She hesitated and then shook her 
head. “No. We have both been 
very indiscreet today, and they are 
suspicious men. It is important in 
their trade to be suspicious. It 
would not be wise to let them think 
we are avoiding them.” 

“OK, I suppose not,” he ac- 
knowledged glumly. He rose and 
followed her down the path. 

L IKE ALL true artists, Moirta 
tended to submerge herself com- 
pletely in her role, a failing which 
the senior gun runner recognized 

THE GUN RUNNERS 


and allowed for in his calculations. 

In the following days, Dolan held 
her hand often, and kissed her 
sometimes, and talked with her 
frequently, and took her in his arms 
for short periods; but at the crucial 
moment Smith or Brown always 
casually appeared upon the scene. 
Dolan suspected, accurately, that 
they were deliberately permitting 
him just enough contact with her 
to keep him constantly on edge, 
keep his mind off other matters. 

They made no overt threats, but 
he was constantly aware of the 
body in the gully, the bulge in 
Smith’s pocket, Brown’s cold eyes 
studying him. Dolan was not a 
submissive person, and under the 
pressure a cold malevolence toward 
the two gun-runners began to de- 
velop in him. He concealed it, as 
well as he could, under a shell of 
impassivity. 

His time would come. The sketch 
of a plan was beginning to form 
in his mind, it was not very solid 
yet, but if it worked out they 
would be laughing on the other side 
of their faces. 

What was it Moirta had said? 
There would be danger “as long 
as we and they are both in this 
time.” The answer to that was 
simple. Eliminate “they” and elim- 
inate the danger. 

In his work, Dolan kept running 
into reminders of the first tech- 
nician, and the matter bothered 
him. The man seemed to have been 
making progress, and surely he 
would not have been such a fool 
as simply to refuse to work, the 
message he had left showed he un- 
derstood quite clearly his danger. 
He asked Moirta about this, and 
got another shock. 


83 



“That was a mistake,” she said. 
“We did not fully understand your 
world then. In our time, medical 
science is very exact. There are 
no incomplete men or incomplete 
women. We assumed that because 
this man . person . looked like 
a man, and seemed to be a man, 
he was one. However, we have 
since discovered that this is not 
always true, and it was not in this 
case. We could not allow him to 
work on the machine, since we 
could not predict his reactions ad- 
equately.” 

Not predict his reactions? There 
was an obvious corollary — 

Dolan’s lips tightened. “But you 
can predict mine, is that it?” 
Moirta ran her fingers lightly 
along the back of his hand, study- 
ing his knuckles with the tips of 
them. “Of course,” she said idly, 
“Why not? There is nothing wrong 
with your reactions, George dear.” 
He flung her hand away vio- 
lently. “Why not? So you push the 
buttons, and I react as predicted, 
and you sit back and laugh at me 
while I fix your machine, and then 
you all go tootling off to find more 
suckers, while I hold the bag. That’s 
it, isn’t it? Boy, I bet you’ve been 
getting a big charge out of this. I 
thought it was mighty coincidental 
the way one of your boyfriends al- 
ways pops up as soon as we’re alone 
for five minutes. Not taking any 
chances on the reaction getting out 
of hand, are you?” 

She stared up at him in shocked 
surprise. “No,” she said, “no. Oh, 
poor George. How stupid of me. 
You see, I am not really very wise, 
I know only one thing, how to be a 
woman. I keep forgetting that you 
do not think as we do. Because we 

84 


can predict a reaction, does that 
make it less real?” 

“But you used me, you knew this 
would happen.” 

There were tears in her eyes. “I 
used you,” she admitted, “and I 
used myself, and Brown used both 
you and me. 

“And you used me, also. Do you 
wish me to think that when you 
hold a woman’s hand, and say 
certain things to her, and look at 
her in a certain way; you are en- 
tirely innocent, you do not guess 
what may happen?” 

“I didn’t force you,” he said 
stubbornly, “the choice was yours 
to make.” 

“Nor did I force you. But I knew 
what your choice would be, and 
further, I knew what my choice 
would be. Emotion is my trade, as 
electronics is yours. Electrons, I 
have been told, have a certain free- 
dom of choice, or appear to have. 
Yet you know with quite high 
probability which choice they will 
make under the influence of cer- 
tain physical fields. In the same 
way, I know what choice to ex- 
pect of a man or a woman, under 
the influence of certain emotional 
fields.” 

“You didn’t want me, though, 
you just wanted a technician. The 
first man would have done just as 
well for you, if he had ‘reacted.’ ” 

“That is true. And I am the first 
woman you have ever made love 
to?” 

“No, of course not. But I’ve 
never felt the same about them as 
I do about you.” 

“I, the same. George, I think you 
still do not understand me. In your 
time there are women who get 
things from men by seeming to 

RALPH WILLIAMS 




promise more than they intend to 
give, for simulating emotions they 
do not feel. You think I am one 
of those . no, please don’t in- 
terrupt ... I am not. In my time 
there are no such women, people 
understand each other too well, 
they are too hard to fool. 

“Instead, there are women like 
me, women who are peculiarly at- 
tractive to men, and peculiarly sus- 
ceptible to men — honestly so. Be- 
lieve me, it is not an easy way to 
make a living. A woman has only 
so much honest emotion to give. Do 
you understand now?” She looked 
up at him appealingly. 

He did not understand, but he 
believed. 

He could not doubt that this was 
as important to her as to him, that 
regardless of the motives behind it, 
her feeling was deep and honest. 
And yet, it was impossible to un- 
derstand, impossible for him to 
visualize a world in which people 

THE GUN RUNNERS 


knew accurately the feeling others 
held for them; and yet still loved, 
disliked, or were indifferent. It was, 
he thought, a little like a caveman 
trying to understand the complex- 
ities and compulsions of polite ur- 
ban society. 

He slumped back down beside 
her. “I don’t know,” he said 
glumly. “You’re right, I suppose, 
it all sounds logical; but I still don’t 
understand.” 

She drew him to her. “Poor 
George,” she said with her mouth 
against his ear. “Poor George, I 
know only one way to console you, 
and only one way to console my- 
self.” She sighed. “And it seems 
they will not permit that, I sup- 
pose the ‘reaction,’ she smiled 
wryly, “would not fit with their 
plans.” 

Dolan straightened and looked 
at her sharply. Her remark had re- 
minded him of something else he 
needed to know. “How do they 

85 


know just when to break us up/’ 
he asked, “just when to drop in 
‘accidentally’ on us? Can they read 
my mind?” 

She shook her head. “No, they 
are not mind-readers. It is just that 
they know so much about what to 
expect of people — remember that 
for thousands of years there has 
been nothing so important to us 
as what other people do, in my 
time men of science no longer 
study physical things, all that is 
known, they study people. In any 
given situation, they can predict 
quite accurately what action a 
given individual will take.” 

“You think they know what 
we’re talking about now?” 

“Not in detail. But in general, 
yes — and I suppose it must serve 
their purpose in some way for us 
to worry about these things, what 
will become of you and me, or they 
would not permit it. In a matter 
such as this, they do nothing with- 
out a purpose.” 

“Well, that’s fair enough,” Dolan 
said grimly. “As long as they aren’t 
actually mind-readers, they can 
guess all they want to.” 

Moirta shook her head. “It is 
not guessing, that is what I have 
been trying to tell. you. Whatever 
you plan, they will have foreseen 
it, perhaps not the exact thing you 
wish to do ; but all the possible 
things you can do, and the most 
likely thing you will do. 

“Really, it will not be so bad, you 
will finish the translator, and we 
will go, and you will forget us, and 
. well, in time I suppose I will 
forget you also.” 

“No.” He squeezed her hard 
against him. “I don’t intend to for- 
get you, and I don’t intend you to 

86 


forget me.” He grinned down at 
her. “In this time, the boy always 
gets the girl, and they live happily 
ever after. It’s a natural law, like 
gravitation. 

“Brown and Smith aren’t infalli- 
ble. They may know people, but I 
know machines. Don’t forget, the 
time translator is the key, the big 
item in this mess. And that’s in my 
bailiwick.” 


OLAN went back to work. 

He left it to Brown to satisfy 
the people at the shop, and appar- 
ently Brown satisfied them, they 
sent along the equipment and sup- 
plies he requested without com- 
ment. 

He still had no idea why the time 
translator worked, but he was be- 
ginning to know quite a bit about 
how it worked, in the sense of func- 
tional operation, the input/output 
relations of the black boxes. A time 
came when he could have activated 
the machine by making a few 
minor connections. 

He did not do so. 

With the knowledge that he had 
the technical problem whipped, 
some of his urgency faded. He 
could take time to amplify and 
clarify his knowledge. Quite prob- 
ably the time translator could never 
be duplicated by twentieth century 
technology. At the same time, only 
a fool would pass up a chance to 
learn what he could, it was too big 
a thing, even with the limitations 
under which it seemed to operate. 
Also, familiarity with the transla- 
tor was a weapon, knowledge 
Brown did not have — a weapon he 
was grimly intent on using. 

He kept testing and checking, 

RALPH WILLIAMS 




varying inputs and measuring out- 
puts. 

Remembering what Moirta had 
said about losing his memory — he 
did not think he would, if his plans 
worked out, but there was always 
the chance of something going 
wrong — he kept careful notes. 
Brown watched this activity bland- 
ly. Thinking it over, Dolan saw 
that this was only logical. There 
were always fires for notes. 

So, as an extra precaution, he 
made copies of the most important 
data in secrecy and stored them in 
a glass jar under a rock back of the 
cottage. Then it occurred to him 
that he might forget about the jar 
— or he might not be around to re- 
member it, there was still the gully 
to keep in mind. Well, what had 
worked once should work again. 
He nicked a code message in a 
piece of wire, showing the location 
of the notes, and left it in his tool- 
box. 

Also, he made certain changes in 
the time-machine. 

Finally, he told Brown the ma- 
chine was ready. 

“You want to test-hop it?” he 
asked. “I’m pretty sure it’ll work 
now, but it’s still a haywire job, I 
could be wrong.” 

Brown shook his head. “Not 
necessary. If the machine works, 
we will be . home. If not, well, 
you will just have to tinker with it 
some more.” It was not sound rea- 
soning, from Dolan’s viewpoint, but 
consistent with what he had come 
to expect from these people in tech- 
nical matters. He had counted 
heavily on such a reaction. 

“OK,” he said. “Then she’s 
ready to go.” 

Brown nodded and tossed a key 
THE GUN RUNNERS 


to Smith, speaking curtly in a lan- 
guage strange to Dolan. Dolan had 
noticed long before that the back 
bedroom door was always locked, 
and the windows securely boarded 
up. Artifacts of historical interest, 
Brown had told him. It seemed like 
rather extreme precaution to take 
for security of such material. 

Brown turned back to Dolan. 
“You had better move your equip- 
ment out of range of the machine 
now, if you wish to keep it,” he 
said. 

Dolan carried his equipment out- 
side. When he returned the three 
aliens were carrying small heavy 
boxes out of the back room, stow- 
ing them in a tight circle about the 
machine. Moirta was straining at 
a heavy case with neatly dove- 
tailed corners, marked “Reming- 
ton”. 

So that was what it was all 
about. 

It suddenly occurred to him to 
wonder how, if the machine could 
not move a person into the future, 
if it had no real existence in this 
time, they expected to move guns 
and ammunition. Did the laws of 
time operate differently for living 
organisms and inanimate things? 
What was it someone had once 
said about life — ‘islands of reverse 
entropy’? But that was only a fig- 
ure of speech, men were still made 
up of the same elements as steel 
and brass — 

Well, it could wait, there were 
more important things right now. 
“You need a hand?” he asked 
Moirta. 

She smiled and nodded breath- 
lessly. 

As he stooped to help lift the 
box, their heads almost touched. 


87 



“Listen!” he whispered, “be on 
your toes, now. I’m going to try 
something. Stay on this side of the 
machine, no matter what happens, 
and do just as I say.” 

She looked startled, but nodded. 
With four of them working, it 
did not take long to pile the cargo 
in place. Brown checked it over 
with his eye and then turned to 
study Dolan. 

“Well,” he said slowly, “I sup- 
pose we are ready to go. No doubt 
you wish your payment now, eh, 
Mr. Dolan?” 

This was the critical point. Dolan 
tensed as Smith stepped clear and 
lifted an inquiring eyebrow at 
Brown, his hand in his hip-pocket; 
but the senior gun runner shook his 
head. “Don’t be stupid,” he said 
quietly. “I think we have a few 
negotiations to make now.” He 
looked at Dolan inquiringly. 

Dolan hoped his relief did not 
show too clearly. He had been rea- 
sonably sure Brown would be too 
acute to kill him off-hand, but it 
had been a tricky moment, just the 
same. Now, he thought, play it 
cagey, make them lay it out on the 
table, get it moving — 

“I’m no good at guessing games,” 
he said. “You’ll have to come down 
to my level on this.” 

Brown nodded. “Of course. Ex- 
cuse me. I will be more explicit. 
Mr. Smith wants to kill you and 
get you out of the way immediate- 
ly; he does not trust you. I do not 
trust you completely myself, I do 
not trust anyone completely; and 
for that exact reason I feel it would 
be stupid and dangerous to kill you. 
I am quite sure you will have 
booby-trapped the machine against 
just such a contingency.” 

88 


“Booby-trapped?” Dolan asked 
blankly. 

“Yes,” Brown said patiently. “I 
mean the machine will not work 
satisfactorily if you are killed. It 
will blow up, burn out, or some 
such thing. Is that not true?” 

Dolan considered the question 
for a moment. He was acutely 
aware that the most devious plot 
would probably seem simple and 
•childish to a man like Brown. “Sup- 
pose it were?” he said cautiously. 
“Then what?” 

“Then we shall negotiate, like 
reasonable people. What do you 
need to convince you of our good 
faith. Your money?” Brown 
reached in his jacket pocket and 
brought out a slip of paper. “Here,” 
he said, “I think you will find this 
satisfactory.” He handed it to 
Dolan. 

Dolan looked absently at the 
check. It was more than satisfac- 
tory — for a purely business trans- 
action. But this was no longer just 
a business transaction. 

“It’s not enough,” he said flatly. 

Brown raised an eyebrow. “The 
girl? No.” He shook his head firm- 
ly. “We must have Moirta for a 
hostage, a guarantee of your good 
faith. She goes with us. Afterward, 
perhaps, if she wishes to return—” 
he shrugged. 

Dolan studied him, trying to de- 
cide just how much Brown’s word 
was worth. Just as much as it suited 
him to make it worth, probably. He 
glanced at Moirta. She shook her 
head, a tiny almost imperceptible 
jerk, confirming his own thought. 
There was no particular reason to 
expect that Brown would really let 
her return — Moirta probably was 
not important to him, but the 

RALPH WILLIAMS 



whereabouts of the time-translator 
was. 

He turned back to Brown. 
“You’ll promise not to stop her?” 
Brown smiled indulgently. “I 
promise.” Dolan felt an almost un- 
controllable urge to smash the 
smug smile with his fist. He bottled 
it up. This was no time to get ex- 
cited. 

“OK,” he said shortly. He 
stepped to the machine and care- 
fully bent a wire just so, while 
Brown watched alertly. 

“Also,” Brown said, “the notes.” 
“Notes?” 

“Exactly. The notes you kept on 
the operation of the machine. Give 
them to me, please.” 

Dolan shrugged. He had not 
really expected to keep the notes. 
“They’re out in my briefcase,” he 
said. Brown looked at Smith, who 
went out and returned in a mo- 
ment with the briefcase. Dolan 
took out a folder and handed it to 
Brown. Brown riffled through the 
pages, nodded and tossed the folder 
on the pile of boxes. 

He studied Dolan speculatively. 
“The other notes, too, please,” he 
said. “The secret notes.” 

The man was guessing, of course. 
Dolan had not even mentioned the 
other notes to Moirta. “You’ve got 
all the notes I made,” he said. 

Brown stepped forward and 
grasped his arm. “Walk!” he com- 
manded. 

Dolan twisted to look at him, 
startled. “What—?” 

“The notes,” Brown said coldly. 
“Walk.” He gave a little shove, and 
Dolan found himself walking, with 
Brown holding his arm in a firm 
even grasp, a look of preoccupation 
on his face. 


“This way,” Brown said. They 
went out the door. 

“The notes,” Brown repeated in- 
sistently. “Keep walking, keep 
walking.” They zigzagged rapidly 
across the yard, Brown still guiding 
Dolan by the arm, Smith coming 
behind with his hand in his pocket. 
Brown paused. “Here, I think,” he 
said to Smith. “Look under that 
rock.” 

Dolan watched in helpless rage 
as Smith dug the jar out and 
handed it to Brown. Was Brown a 
mind-reader, after all? How else — ? 

Well, of course, he thought, mus- 
cular tension, the old ‘mind-read- 
ing’ trick. He should have caught 
on sooner; but Brown was good at 
it, no doubt about that. 

Brown smashed the jar against 
the rock and stuffed the notes in 
his pocket. They went back in to 
the time machine. 

Brown bent over the control box 
and studied it carefully. He ex- 
amined the wire Dolan had ad- 
justed. For the first time, there was 
a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. 

“Well,” he said absently. “I sup- 
pose — ” he looked comprehensively 
around, checking the position of 
the cargo. “There is something — ” 
He punched the power button, 
moved his hand to start the ma- 
chine. 

Dolan glanced at Moirta. She 
sat on one of the boxes on the far 
side of the machine, watching him. 

This was the time, now — 

He stepped forward and opened 
his mouth to shout. 

He never did. Something went 
suddenly wrong. Brown flicked a 
thumb, Smith moved like light- 
ning, and before Dolan realized 
what was happening, he found him- 

89 


THE GUN RUNNERS 



self flat on his back, wondering 
numbly what had happened. 

Brown snapped a syllable at 
Moirta. She answered with a shrug 
and a word. He frowned momen- 
tarily and then his face lightened. 

“Ah,” he said softly. “I think I 
see, now. You were going to shout 
to Moirta to run out of range of 
the machine, while you jumped in 
and activated it, isn’t that so? Real- 
ly, it would have done no good, we 
could still have returned, and be- 
sides Moirta — ” he frowned sud- 
denly. “Oh could we have re- 
turned?” 

He bit delicately at his lower 
lip. “Moirta,” he said. “Step a lit- 
tle closer to the machine, please.” 

“Now,” he turned back to Dolan, 
“I am going to push the buttons, 
with Moirta quite close to the ma- 
chine. Are there any last-minute 
changes you wish to make?” 

Dolan hesitated, studying both 
Moirta’s and the men’s positions, 
and then nodded sullenly. 

“I thought there might be,” 
Brown said with satisfaction. “Mr. 
Smith, help Mr. Dolan up to the 
machine.” 

Dolan reached out unsteadily, 
leaning on Smith, and reversed 
two connections. “That’s it,” he 
mumbled. 

“Thank you, Mr. Dolan. Now, 
Mr. Smith, if you will just carry 
Mr. Dolan over there into the cor- 
ner, well away from the machine, 
and immobilize him — no, no, just 
temporarily. We may still need him 
again, Mr. Dolan is a very tricky 
sort of person.” 

Dolan felt Smith’s fingers touch 
his neck lightly, there was a sud- 
den blazing pain, and that was all. 
He blanked out. 


T HE FIRST thing he knew after 
that was that fingers were work- 
ing gently at his neck, massaging it. 
His head was resting on something 
soft. He opened his eyes and saw 
that he was lying with his head 
pillowed on Moirta’s lap. 

“George?” she said sharply. “Are 
you all right, George?” 

“I’m all right,” he said. He raised 
his head and looked around. The 
machine was gone, and Smith and 
Brown were gone, and half the 
boxes were gone. The end ones in 
the little semicircle were broken, 
and from them a pile of brass cart- 
ridges had spilled through the hole 
in the floor where the others had 
been. 

“Wise jerks,” he mumbled with 
grim satisfaction. “See how they 
like it now.” 

Moirta stared at him. “What 
happened, George? I don’t under- 
stand what happened.” 

“I gimmicked the machine. 
That’s what happened. Surprise, 
huh? I’ll bet they were plenty sur- 
prised too.” 

“But I thought — ” 

Dolan sat up and felt tenderly 
of his throat. He nodded. “I know,” 
he said. “You thought they had me 
licked. So did they. That was just 
smoke-screen, a little diversion. I 
knew they could out-smart me if I 
tried to pull anything foxy, that’s 
their trade. But they weren’t really 
mind-readers, you told me that, 
and the business with the notes 
cinched it. 

“And they didn’t think like tech- 
nicians. They could see I might dis- 
able the machine, or booby-trap it ; 
but they couldn’t see I could fix it 
so it would work, only just a little 
different.

“All I had to do was to keep 
their minds on their own specialty, 
let them wear out their suspicion 
on the little foxy tricks they ex- 
pected, so they wouldn’t notice 
what I was really doing. See?” 

She shook her head. “No,” she 
said. “I do not see. I suppose I’m 
stupid, too — ” 

“Not stupid. Just not technically 
minded. You understand, this ma- 
chine works by setting up a field 
around itself, ordinarily that field’s 
circular, it takes in everything in a 
certain radius. But it doesn’t have 
to be, that’s just because it’s the 
easiest way, more convenient. So I 
just distorted the field a little, made 
it lopsided. Then I went through 
all that other business to keep their 
minds on me, keep them off your 
position, and make sure they both 
stayed over on my side.” He smiled 
at her. “I told you, remember, in 
this time the villains always get it 
in the neck, the boy gets the girl, 
and they live happily ever after.” 

She shook her head. “No,” she 
said gently. “I’m sorry, for you and 
me there will not be any ever 
after. You forget the displacement 
effect.” 

“Displacement effect?” 

“Yes,” she said. “I am afraid I 
did not explain that fully to you, I 
thought it would only hurt you to 
do so. You understand, the past is 
really immutable, we only seem to 
change it. For the time that the 
time-translator exists at any given 
time in the past, a sort of enclave, 
a self-supporting bubble, is estab- 
lished which permits apparent 
changes. When the time translator 
returns to its normal existence in 
mv era, that bubble dissolves. I do 
not know, in terms of our present 

THE GUN RUNNERS 


subjective time, just how long the 
displacement will hold, but when 
it vanishes we, you and I, will no 
longer exist.” 

“But that would be a change in 
the past, in itself.” 

“Not exactly. What I told you 
about forgetting was true, it was 
just not the whole truth. There will 
be, in my time, a Moirta who exists 
normally up to the time she is 
translated to the past. And there 
will be, in your time, a George 
Dolan who never met Mr. Brown 
or Miss Jones. But you and I, as 
we exist at this moment, will not 
have been.” 

“I see,” Dolan said. “It’s too bad 
I didn’t know about this sooner. I 
think we still may have a chance, 
though. You see, I had to worry 
about the possibility that Smith and 
Brown might think it worth while 
to come back after you. So I 
changed the switches, too. The 
time translator isn’t going into the 
future, it’s gone into the past, and 
then it’s fixed to burn out again, a 
long way in the past, where there 
aren’t any electronics technicians, 
no people at all. How about that?” 

“The past? I don’t know,” she 
said doubtfully. I am not a tem- 
poral technician, I know only 
about the displacement effect as it 
operates in our usual translations. 
Perhaps, in that case, the bubble 
might continue to exist, as a sort 
of permanent side-track. I really 
don’t know.” 

She laughed suddenly, as the full 
implications of what he had said 
struck her. “The past? Oh, poor 
Smith. And poor Brown. A long 
way in the past, where there are no 
people at all, just dinosaurs and 
snakes — and they hate such things 

91 



so.” She laughed helplessly, tears 
rolling down her cheeks. “And poor 
George, and poor Moirta. All with 
their clever little plans, their tricks 
to outsmart each other. Everyone 
has outsmarted everyone else, and 
we all lose now, don’t we?” 

Dolan stared at her narrowly. 
“We all lose?” 

She nodded — 

T HE SENIOR gun runner had 
been quite confident of victory. 
It took him a rather long mo- 
ment to assimilate the fact of de- 
feat; but in that moment he did 
assimilate it, as fully and complete- 
ly as he took in the implications of 
any other situation. 

He examined the wreckage of 
the time translator curiously, tried 
and failed to make sense of the er- 
ratic pattern in which their cargo 
had accompanied them, the absence 
of Moirta. He straightened and 
looked about. There were no dino- 
saurs, the range of the time ma- 
chine did not extend that far; but 
over on a ledge of rock a large cat 
with hyper-trophied eyeteeth squat- 
ted, switching its stub of a tail, 
startled by their sudden appear- 
ance. 

He sighed and turned toward the 
other gun runner. “Old, old, time,” 
he said. He nodded toward the cat. 
“Bad for us. No chance rescue. 
Supplies short.” 

The other said nothing, watching 
him narrowly, hand in back pocket. 
Down in the valley below, some- 
thing trumpeted, a hoarse grunt- 
ing roar. The senior gun runner 
started nervously. It was getting 
dark. 

He held out his hand. “Older 


first,” he said simply. The younger 
man laid the gun in his hand; and 
the senior gun runner, without hesi- 
tation or farewell, raised it to his 
head and pulled the trigger. 

“ — yes, everyone,” Moirta said. 
She wiped at her eyes. “I’m sorry, 
George. I will die very quickly in 
this time, whether the displacement 
operates or not.” 

“But you said — !” 

“I know. I was so sure there was 
nothing you could do, and I said 
what I thought would make you 
happy. And I did want to stay 
with you, in a way, even though I 
knew it would kill me . and in 
another way, I wanted to go back, 
to return to my own time, and you 
were my means to that . oh, it’s 
so mixed up, really, it is funny, 
everyone so sure of themselves, and 
now . this . .” 

Dolan shook his head helplessly. 
“I never thought. You seemed so 
. so . .” 

“So human?” her lips curled wry- 
ly. “I was made to seem human, 
twentieth-century human, it was 
part of my job. I’m not. And soon, 
I shall not even seem human, with- 
out the things I need — things that 
won’t even be invented for ten 
thousand years — cancer inhibitors, 
blood clotting agents, insulin sur- 
rogate, vaccines, serums, antibiotics 
— why, I can’t even eat your food!” 
She shook her head sadly. “You 
had better just leave me, it will not 
be nice, you will not like me at all.” 
And yet, even with the game 
played out, she could not forget her 
trade, her specialty, for it was bred 
into her as deeply as the tendency 
to leukemia, the hemophilia, the

A Cold Night for Crying 

BY M I LTON LESSER 


HE SNOW sifted silently down, 
clouds of white confetti in the 
glare of the street lamps, mantling 
the streets with white, spilling 
softly from laden, wind-stirred 
branches, drifting with the wind 
and embanking the scars and 
stumps of buildings that remained 
of what had been the city. 

Mr. Friedlander trudged across 
the wide, quiet avenues, his bare, 
balding head burrowed low in his 
tattered collar for warmth, chin 
against chest, wet feet numb and 
stinging with cold inside his torn 
overshoes which could not be re- 
placed until next winter, and then 
only if the Karadi did not decrease 
the clothing ration still further.* 
All the way home, he conjured 
fantasies from the white, multi- 
shaped exhalations of his breath. 


Here it was the smoke of a good 
Havana-rolled cigar and there the 
warm hissing steam from a radiator 
valve and later the magic-carpet 
clouds from the funnel of an ocean 
liner that might take him to far, 
warm places the Karadi had not 
reached. Almost, he thought he 
heard the great sonorous drone of 
the ship’s whistle, but it was the 
toot of an automobile horn as the 
sleek vehicle came skidding around 
a corner, almost running down Mr. 
Friedlander before it disappeared 
in the swirling flurries of snow. He 
thought if he followed the tire 
tracks before the snow could cover 
them he would discover in which 
section of the city these particular 
Karadi lived, but he shook his fist 
instead, knowing the gesture would 
bring, at worst, a reprimand. 



94 




In the dim hallway of his tene- 
ment, smelling pungently of cab- 
bage and turnips — and from some- 
where way in back the faint, un- 
mistakable aroma of beef — Mr. 
Friedlander shook the snow from 
his coat and stamped his numb 
feet before he climbed the three 
dark flights to his apartment. At 
each landing he would pause and 
look with longing and resentment 
at the door of the unused elevator 
shaft, then shrug and wonder why 
the Karadi had denied man even 
this simple luxury. 

On the floor below his own, Mr. 
Friedlander heard the unmistak- 
able crackling sound of a short- 
wave radio receiver. The fools! He 
wasn’t going to talk, he lost no love 
on the Karadi. But there were 
others. There were neighbors, 
friends, brothers, even wives, there 
were the obvious quislings you 
shunned and the less obvious ones 
you didn’t suspect until it was too 
late. One thing you never did was 
listen to the short-wave radio so 
defiantly its crackling could be 
heard not merely on the other side 
of the door but all the way out on 
the landing. The punishment was 
death. 

Mr. Friedlander paused in front 
of his own door, where the odor of 
strong yellow turnips assailed his 
nostrils. It was so unsatisfyingly fa- 
miliar, he almost gagged. The new 
generation hardly remembered the 
delightful old foods, but if Mr. 
Friedlander shut his eyes and 
thought, he could clearly smell 
steak and roast chicken and broiled 
lobster swimming in butter and a 
dry red wine to wash everything 
down slowly, so slowly he could 
taste every tiny morsel. 



95 


He pushed open the door and 
began to shrug off his worn coat. 
“I’m home,” he said to the scabby 
walls, the gas range which had been 
converted to wood when the Kara- 
di suspended all public utilities, to 
the bubbling pot which exuded 
the turnip smell, to the drab sofa, 
the two wooden chairs, the table he 
had constructed from two old saw 
horses and the planking he had 
found long ago after the Fourteenth 
Street Bomb. 

From the small bedroom, he 
heard sobbing. 

RS. FRIEDLANDER blinked 
red-rimmed eyes at him and 
squeezed his hand, wringing it as if 
it had been a wet rag. She was 
forty-four years old, six years 
younger than Mr. Friedlander, with 
a face which once had been comely 
but now was lined, gaunt and big- 
pored. She was even thinner than 
Mr. Friedlander, but looked shape- 
less in her thick woolen sweater 
and the baggy work trousers he 
had stolen from the quartermaster 
store of the plant where he worked. 

“Try to tell me, Martha,” he 
^aid. “It’s good to talk.” 

She looked at him mutely, open- 
ing her mouth to talk but swallow- 
ing instead. 

“You tell me, Martha. There 
now.” 

She managed to get the words 
out. “It’s Freddie.” 

Mr. Friedlander placed a tired 
arm about her shoulder. The feel- 
ing had started in the pit of his 
stomach, like when their son 
George had died of pneumonia two 
years ago this month. The Karadi 
had outlawed all wonder drugs, all 


hospitals, all medical schools. Help- 
less, they had watched George die, 
his big child eyes not understand- 
ing, asking for help. Mr. Fried- 
lander always wondered if he had 
died hating them. 

“People die and you see them. 
You know,” Mrs. Friedlander 
said. “They are sick and you can’t 
do anything but try to nurse them, 
anyway. Or the big Karadi cars 
run them down and you see the 
broken body. You see them. Alive. 
Then dead. It’s hard, so hard you 
want to stop living too, but there’s 
God and God shows you they are 
dead and you have the memories, 
all the sweet ones. You know 
they’re dead because you see them 
dying. You can forget. In time, you 
forget. You have to forget because 
otherwise you don’t want to live, 
but you . hold me. Hold me 
tight.” 

Mr. Friedlander patted her hair 
awkwardly. The Karadi not only 
condoned but encouraged displays 
of simple emotion and for that rea- 
son Mr. Friedlander tried to avoid 
them. “What are you trying to tell 
me?” he asked. 

“Freddie. Freddie. His plane was 
shot down over the mountains, they 
told me. Freddie is dead. Freddie.” 

Mr. Friedlander stopped patting 
his wife’s hair, stopped stroking the 
tangles into a smooth glossiness. He 
bent down and carefully unbuckled 
his torn overshoes, placing them 
carefully in a corner of the room. 
Then he walked to the window and 
stared out at the snow sparkling in 
wind-blown puffs under the street 
lamp which remained only because 
the Karadi liked to drive their con- 
fiscated autos at night. “What are 
you saying?” he asked his wife. 

MILTON LESSER

“Just because they tell us Fred- 
die is dead — ” 

“Stop it. Don’t say that.” 
“Freddie is dead. Because they 
tell us, that’s no reason to believe. 
How can we believe? We saw 
Freddie alive, but now they tell us 
Freddie is dead. Far away, two 
thousand miles. Over the moun- 
tains. Did we see him die? He’s 
dead. Oh, he’s dead. But we’ll 
never learn to live with it. Don’t 
you see? How can we believe? How 
can we know? We saw him alive. 
Now he’s dead.” 

Freddie was flying a Karadi 
plane against the last strongholds 
of free man in the Rocky Moun- 
tains. Not because Freddie had 
wanted to pilot the dart-swift craft 
particularly, but because they had 
made him. The Karadi announced 
their own human losses readily, al- 
most as if they took great pleasure 
in the impressive figures. “They 
told you this?” Mr. Friedlander 
asked. 

“That Freddie’s plane was shot 
down. That he is assumed dead.” 
“You saw nothing in writing?” 
“They sent a man.” 

“You knew him?” 

“No. He wore good clothing. He 
drove up in a sleek Karadi car.” 
“Quisling.” 

“Freddie died a hero’s death, he 
said. Against the rebels.” 

“Rebels? Trying to preserve their 
own freedom? Freedom which we 
lost because the bombed cities 
couldn’t survive?” 

“I only know what the man told 

me, but how can we how . 

all my life, always, forever, I will 
be praying and waiting for Fred- 
die to walk in, right behind you, 
through that door. We never saw 

A COLD NIGHT FOR CRYING 


him die. They should at least send 
something. Some proof. Anything 
to make me understand he is dead.” 

Mr. Friedlander had been think- 
ing the same thing. If you loved 
someone, your son, all his life and 
then a stranger came and said he 
was dead you could forget the 
stranger came and go on thinking 
of that someone, your son, alive 
and not dead, but too busy to come 
and see you, eating the food you 
could only dream about, sleeping 
in a warm bed, in some clean place 
far away. Only it was like the cat 
he once had read about. You took 
the cat and gave it food, catnip, 
but every time it ate you also fed it 
electricity, a shock. It wanted to 
eat but it was afraid of the elec- 
tricity, the shock. It starved to death 
screeching from hunger in a room 
full of food. If that was what the 
Karadi wanted, he would say Fred- 
die was dead. He would believe and 
laugh everytime he saw them be- 
cause they thought he was screech- 
ing from hunger in a room full of 
food. 

“Stop it,” Mr. Friedlander told 
his wife. “You stop that. If they 
say so, then Freddie is dead. We 
must put an announcement in the 
Karadi newspaper and make plans 
for a funeral.” 

“In all this snow? It’s so cold.” 

“Anyway.” 

Mrs. Friedlander walked to the 
stove and stirred the bubblying tur- 
nip water. “You come and eat your 
supper,” she said. “We’ll talk about 
Freddie later.” 

“There’s nothing to talk about. 
Only the funeral.” 

“Maybe he was lying. The stran- 

5 ) 

ger. 

“Stop; that. It’s what they want. 

97 



They want us to be animals. They 
want us never to know. Always 
doubting. Always clean in dirty 
places, working hard, using all our 
energy to be only a little better than 
animals. Every time you see a Ka- 
radi, you won’t hate him. You’ll 
think maybe he’s going to tell you 
some good news about Freddie. It 
was all a mistake. They want that, 
too. They feed on our sorrow and 
despair and confusion. There is a 
word for them and their invasion 
and why they are here. They don’t 
need us, our resources. They feed 
on what we feel. They are a — a 
sadistic fungi.” 

“Fred! Eat your supper and 
you’ll feel better. You must be half 
frozen.” 

“It’s warmer in here.” 

Mrs. Friedlander shivered, al- 
though she stood near the stove. 
“It’s still cold. I hope it’s warm 
where Freddie is.” 

He slapped her and was glad 
when she cried, then sorry, then 
glad again when she came into his 
arms, sobbing. They would make 
funeral arrangements in the morn- 
ing. 

After supper a man from the 
Karadi newspaper visited them. 
He wore a new overcoat and shin- 
ing plastic overshoes and a bright 
scarf of red wool around his neck. 
His face was plump, his cheeks 
rosy, his well-groomed hair smelling 
of some expensive perfume when 
he removed hat and earlaps. 

“Mr. and Mrs. Friedlander,” he 
said, his voice like the dimly re- 
membered taste of pure maple 
syrup, “I bring you the heartfelt 
sympathies of the Karadi News- 
paper. If it is any consolation, know 
that your son, Freddie Friedlander, 

98 


Jr., died a hero’s death against the 
barbarians of the mountains.” His 
nose was running with the cold; he 
padded it daintily with a pale blue 
silk handkerchief. He offered Mr. 
Friedlander a small, dry-crackling 
cigar, took one himself and touched 
flame to them with a monogramed 
lighter. Mr. Friedlander inhaled 
gratefully, allowing the unfamiliar 
smoke to sear his lungs painfully 
before he exhaled a long blue 
plume at the ceiling. For Mrs. 
Friedlander the man from the Ka- 
radi Newspaper had a small box of 
candy, the chocolate frozen over 
with powdery white but, by the ex- 
pression on Mrs. Friedlander’s face, 
succulent nevertheless. 

“At times like this,” the man 
from the Karadi Newspaper said 
after he had politely refused what 
was left of the yellow turnip mash, 
“it is customary to place an ad in 
the newspaper in memory of the 
departed. The cost, in such cases, 
is quite reasonable — benevolent, 
you might say. Seven days of over- 
time for Mr. Friedlander.” 

“But,” said Mrs. Friedlander, “if 
we place the announcement in the 
Karadi Newspaper, don’t you see? 
We are admitting Freddie is dead.” 
The man from the Karadi News- 
paper cocked an eyebrow in prac- 
ticed surprise. “He is quite dead, 
Mrs. Friedlander.” 

“What my wife means is that, 
well, we didn’t see him die.” 

“Then you don’t believe the Ka- 
radi?” 

“That’s not it at all,” said Mr. 
Friedlander. “If Freddie is dead, it 
is unhealthy not to believe. We 
want to believe. We find it diffi- 
cult.” 

“I understand,” the man said. 

MILTON LESSER 



“I would suggest a large ad in that 
case. Two weeks overtime, Mr. 
Friedlander. Write it yourself. 
Don’t use any of the forms. Write 
it from your heart, from what you 
feel deep inside.” 

“I suppose that is best,” Mr. 
Friedlander admitted, secretly 
amazed at his own objective reac- 
tion to his son’s passing. The sor- 
row would come later, he told him- 
self. The grief, when it came, would 
be good. It would wash them clean 
so they could live again. Even at 
the funeral. He guessed, they 
would walk slowly with measured 
tread and be sad, but they would 
expect Freddie to join them in their 
sadness, as if it were a funeral but 
not his funeral at all. Mr. Fried- 
lander was about to tell this to the 
man from the Karadi Newspaper 
because he thought it was a great 
truth and he had discovered it, 
when there was a knock on the 
door. 

It was Mr. Davidson from down- 
stairs on the second floor, a small 
old man, just bones and clothing 
and a high voice, who lived alone 
in the apartment where his wife 
had died four years before of old 
age. It was said the Karadi wanted 
old men like Mr. Davidson to go 
on living because they were unpro- 
ductive and had to be cared for by 
younger people who could hardly 
make ends meet, thus lowering the 
standard of living. Everyone in the 
tenament took turns inviting Mr. 
Davidson in for dinner. 

“Beautiful snow, isn’t it?” Mr. 
Davidson demanded, puckering his 
dry lips in a toothless grin. “Have 
you heard about Freddie? Have 
you heard the news?” 

He seemed spitefully cheerful, 

A COLD NIGHT FOR CRYING 


Mr. Friedlander thought. Happy 
because he had outlived a man two 
generations his junior? If, indeed, 
it was such a case of sadistic glee — 
so like the Karadi themselves — Mr. 
Friedlander made a mental note to 
stop inviting the old man to share 
their dinner. 

“Yes, sir, great news,” chirped 
Mr. Davidson. Then: “Who’s your 
friend?” 

“He’s from the Karadi News- 
paper,” Mrs. Friedlander ex- 
plained. “Here to see about plac- 
ing an announcement in the pa- 
per. 

“Damned quisling,” spat Mr. 
Davidson. The old folks certainly 
had privileges. That remark would 
mean a month of overtime for Mr. 
Friedlander, who turned earthen- 
ware kitchen pots on an archaic 
wheel. All it earned Mr. Davidson 
was a scowl from the man from 
the Karadi Newspaper. 

“What great news are you talk- 
ing about?” the man wanted to 
know. 

“Great news? Who said anything 
about great news? Why don’t you 
mind your own business, anyway?” 

“You said it, old man. Great 
news, you said. I want to know.” 

“Maybe I did and maybe I 
didn’t.” 

“You did.” 

“Don’t always remember. Just 
what were we talking about? Fred- 
die Friedlander, wasn’t it?” 

“Yes.” 

“Like I said, great news. We all 
don’t get to die a hero’s death. No, 
sir. Lookit me, now. Die in bed one 
of these nights, just like that.” 
Claw-like fingers snapped and 
made a singularly dry sound. 
“Who’ll care? Who’ll know until I 


99 



don’t show up for dinner one 
night? Great news. Great thing to 
die a hero’s death, I always say.” 

The man from the Karadi News- 
paper smiled. “I certainly misun- 
derstood you, old timer. I like your 
attitude. If the boy is dead, let’s 
look at the bright side of the pic- 
ture.” 

All at once, Mrs. Friedlander 
wailed Freddie’s name and cupped 
her face in coarse, work-hardened 
hands. “Freddie’s dead,” she 
sobbed. “Dead, dead, dead . 

Mr. Friedlander gulped and 
turned away. If he touched her 
now he would break down too. He 
plopped a fork in the turnip mash 
and made little tracks with the 
tines, criss-crossing them like the 
tracks in the deserted railroad 
yards down by the river. 

“You see,” the man from the 
Karadi Newspaper said, “that’s ex- 
actly what I said. The announce- 
ment is good for you. Let other peo- 
ple know about Freddie and you’ll 
be able to live with your terrible 
loss. This man has been very help- 
ful.” 

“Please,” Mr. Friedlander told 
him. “Not now.” 

“But now is exactly the time.” 
The man explored through his 
pockets and found an announce- 
ment blank for Mr. Friedlander, a 
stiff yellow sheet of paper folded 
over crisply three times, with words 
printed in upper case letters and 
many blank lines to be filled in. 
Mr. Friedlander read it, handed it 
back to the man from the Karadi 
Newspaper, who then asked ques- 
tions and filled in the blanks with a 
precise hand as Mr. Friedlander 
answered him. 

The man stood up, giving Mr. 


Friedlander another small cigar 
and giving two of them to Mr. 
Davidson. “Karadi blessings on 
you,” he said. “You’ll be notified 
at work about your overtime, Mr. 
Friedlander.” 

“When will we see it in the news- 
paper?” 

“Tomorrow. Afternoon edition. 
Karadi blessings.” 

The man was gone. 

HERE,” said Mr. Friedlander. 
“Go ahead and cry. It will do 
you good. Cry all you want.” 
“Young jackass,” muttered Mr. 
Davidson. “Thought he’d never 
leave. And don’t you cry, young 
lady. Laugh. Sing. Jump for joy. I 
couldn’t tell you the great news 
about Freddie while that man was 
here.” 

“We heard about Freddie,” Mr. 
Friedlander said in a chill voice. 
“Will you please go downstairs?” 
“You heard baloney, or you 
wouldn’t be talking like that. Fred- 
die ain’t dead.” 

“What did you say?” Mr. Fried- 
lander stood perfectly still, in the 
center of the room, his back to the 
stove, trying to peer through the 
window which by now had frosted 
over. Mrs. Friedlander had stopped 
her crying, hands clasped in front of 
her, below her waist, in an obse- 
quious Oriental pose which the 
Karadi promoted. 

“I said Freddie ain’t dead.” 
“What are you talking about?” 
“Heard it on the short-wave, by 
God. Wouldn’t kid about a thing 
like this. I came busting in here to 
tell you, only that quisling was here 
and I had to wait.” 

“You mean it’s you who owns

the short-wave set downstairs?” de- 
manded Mr. Friedlander. “I never 
stopped on the landing. I always 
ran upstairs. You see, I didn’t want 
to know who owned the short- 
wave, who listened to the — ” 

“The free radio, other side of 
the Rockies? Go ahead, say it. 
Listen to me, Mr. Friedlander. 
Those Karadi ain’t here to stay. If 
you stopped to think of it a min- 
ute, you’d understand like the rest 
of us.” 

“The rest of you?” 

“Well, a lot of us, anyway. They 
don’t need us. We have nothing 
they want. They enjoy making us 
knuckle under, is all. Something 
in their makeup, I don’t know 
what. They won’t stay here for- 
ever, though some of us won’t be 
around long enough to see them

go. 

“What’s all that got to do 
with . ?” 

“With Freddie and the short- 
wave? He’s been captured, Mr. 
Friedlander! By the free folk. He’s 
on their side now, the side all of 
us want to be on but can’t be. He’s 
alive, you understand?” 

“You wouldn’t just be saying 
this? You’re sure?” 

“Wouldn’t you trust the word of 
your own people, the people who 
saw him come down by parachute, 
who took him in, got his name and 
beamed it back here so you, his 
folks, wouldn’t have to worry none? 
Well, wouldn’t you?” 

“Yes!” Mrs. Friedlander cried in 
a tremulous voice. “Oh, yes . .” 
“Sensible girl,” said Mr. David- 
son. 

Walking to the window and wip- 
ing away a circle of frost with his 
hand, Mr. Friedlander felt a spring 

A COLD NIGHT FOR CRYING 


in his step he hadn’t felt for twenty 
years, since the day the Karadi 
came swooping down from space 
and caught the world in a tired 
breathing spell in World War III. 
Freddie was alive — and safe. Fred- 
die was free. He must tell everyone. 
He must shout it now, to all the 
neighbors, and shout it again at 
work tomorrow, and withdraw his 
announcement from the Karadi 
Newspaper and a hundred other 
things. He lifted the warped win- 
dow, with cardboard replacing two 
of the shattered panes, and 
breathed in the crisp, cold night 
air. “I’ll visit the newspaper in the 
morning,” he said. “Tell them to 
forget all about the announce- 
ment.” He turned around and 
faced his wife and Mr. Davidson. 
“What are you crying for? Stop 
crying.” 

“I’m so happy, Fred.” 

“Maybe I can get down to the 
newspaper now and see their night 
man.” 

“Hold on there,” Mr. Davidson 
said. “Are you crazy or something, 
young feller? Want to fit the noose 
around my neck yourself? Not just 
me, but all the others. Think I’m 
the only one? There’s Mr. and Mrs. 
Peters, and the Schwartz’s, the 
McDonalds, the Kopaks. You’re 
just slow catching on, that’s all.” 

“You mean they all have short- 
waves, all those people?” 

“That’s exactly what I mean. 
We have to find freedom our own 
way. Oh, we conform. We cry 
when we’re supposed to, and laugh. 
But at night we listen to the radio 
and learn some of the truth, so 
that when the Karadi get bored 
with us and decide to leave, we 
can take our places in a free world. 

101 



Took me two years to build that 
short-wave out of spare parts, but 
it was worth every minute.” 

“What do you do when they 
come around hunting?” Mr. Fried- 
lander asked. 

“Hide it, of course. Son, you’re 
afraid of your own shadow.” 

“I am not. I just didn’t know.” 
“For a time we were worried 
about you. Thought maybe you was 
a quisling. Now I had to take the 
chance. I just had to tell you. Lis- 
ten, here’s the thing. Here’s what 
we’ll do. We’ll let the announce- 
ment stick in the paper. Got to 
make them think we believe. Then 
we’ll have ourselves a real solemn 
funeral out to the graveyard near 
92nd Street. Know a preacher 
who’ll wring every last tear out of 
all of us. I mean all. We’ll all go. 
The Kopaks, the Schwartz’s, the 
Peters, everyone who heard in on 
the short-wave about Freddie and 
how he’s alive and everything. The 
sadder we look, the happier we’ll 
feel, later on. Then we’ll have our- 
selves a real old fashioned cele- 
bration, like before the Karadi 
came. Mr. McDonald says he has a 
bottle of real champagne he was 
saving for when his girl Betty got 
married, but I talked him into let- 
ting us use it. Son, we’ll pull out 
all the stops. Of course, you can’t 
really get looped on an ounce or 
so of champagne, but we sure can 
try! Well, see you at the funeral.” 
And Mr. Davidson went down- 
stairs, cackling and whistling the 
dirge from Beethoven’s Eroica. 

“Well,” said Mr. Friedlander to 
his wife, “what do you think?” 

“I think it’s wonderful. That 
nice man, going to all that trouble.” 

102 


“I’m not so sure. What do we 
know about Mr. Davidson? Maybe 
he’s lying. Maybe he’s — ” 

“He wouldn’t lie, not about a 
thing like that.” 

“I know how you feel. I felt that 
way at first, too. Free and — well, 
relaxed for the first time in so long 
I can’t remember. But then I got 
to thinking. What if he’s senile? 
What if he imagined the whole 
thing? It would be a sin to cele- 
brate, with Freddie dead.” 

“We could ask Mr. Peters, or the 
others. And Freddie’s not dead!” 
“That’s what you want to be- 
lieve. It’s what I want to believe, 
too.” Mr. Friedlander walked to 
the window again, where the pane 
was frosting over once more, giving 
a ghostlike quality to the street, the 
lamps, the facades of the other 
tenaments, the snow-laden trees 
outside. He wanted to believe. But 
he had wanted to believe, in his 
youth, that the killing war would 
one day end. When it did, the Ka- 
radi had come, with talk of peace 
— although with their invincible 
weapons they had disarmed all the 
world’s armies and, instead of re- 
building, had made a shambles of 
our civilization. Every day the Ka- 
radi told lies and told you to be- 
lieve. And planted spies to see that 
you did. And visited you at unex- 
pected moments to see that you 
conformed. And trained your chil- 
dren to fight against free people, 
free people who they said were 
your enemies. And gave extra 
clothing rations to a spy, to a be- 
liever, to a man in the Karadi 
image. 

“We can’t ask the others,” Mr. 
Friedlander said. “What if Mr. 
Davidson was lying, or making it 

MILTON LESSER 



all up? You can’t go around talk- 
ing about short-waves and things. 
It isn’t safe.” 

“We have to know!” 

“Do you want to be turned in as 
an undesirable? Is that what you 
want? We already know. The Ka- 
radi told us.” The more he spoke, 
the easier it was to convince him- 
self. You couldn’t live with doubt. 
The Karadi fostered doubt and 
taught you that: you had to avoid 
it. You had to know. This is so, 
this is not so — if this other thing 
may or may not be so, I don’t want 
to talk about it. Alternative A or 
alternative B. Simple. Concise. 
What did old Mr. Davidson know, 
anyway, listening to his subversive 
radio? Why should the barbarians 
in the mountains tell the truth any 
more than the Karadi or their 
agents? The barbarians are our 
enemies. It’s propaganda. Maybe 
Mr. Davidson is a saboteur for 
them. 

“Is that clear?” Mr. Friedlander 
demanded. “Is that quite, quite 
clear? Cry if you want. Freddie is 
dead. Freddie is dead. Dead. You 
can’t believe all the wild stories you 
hear.” 

Mrs. Friedlander was smiling at 
him through her tears, wiping them 
away, assuming again the Oriental 
pose. “You believe what you want,” 
she said. “We won’t celebrate. We 
won’t pretend. We’ll say Freddie is 
dead. But I’ll believe — what I be- 
lieve. And I’m thankful to Mr. 
Davidson.” 

“So you can live in doubt all the 
rest of your life? For that you’re 
thankful?” 

“I’m thankful for a crumb when 
I expected nothing. Where are you 
going?” 

A COLD NIGHT FOR CRYING 


Mr. Friedlander was buckling his 
worn overcoat and forcing his shoes 
into wet overshoes. “Out for a 
walk,” he said. “I want to think.” 
“It’s a cold night.” 

“I don’t care.” 


O UTSIDE, with the snow still 
falling, drifting down in un- 
hurried silence, he found himself 
hating Mr. Davidson. The man 
should have minded his own busi- 
ness. Old meddler. He was a men- 
ace to the community, too. Whose 
side was he on, anyway? A senile 
old man? An agent provocateur for 
the barbarians in the western 
mountains? Was his self-appointed 
mission in life to see to it that peo- 
ple like poor Mrs. Friedlander 
never knew another moment of 
peace all the rest of their lives? 

The short-wave radio — all lies. It 
had to be lies. If it weren’t lies you 
could understand nothing. Black 
is white or white is black. Everyone 
saying something else. You don’t 
know. You never know. 

He didn’t want to start any trou- 
ble. He wasn’t looking for trouble. 
He was only a good, Karadi-fearing 
citizen who knew his place. But 
Mr., Davidson had made a revela- 
tion to him. If all the others, if all 
those people Mr. Davidson had 
named, chuckling over each name, 
taking secret delight in each one 
as if he, the patriarch of the tena- 
ment had converted them, one at a 
time or in groups, into clandestine 
outlaws, if all those people were 
subversive, thought Mr. Fried- 
lander, why should he suffer along 
with them? Was it fair that he re- 
ceived the same inadequate food, 
the same squalid lodging, the same 

103 



menial jobs to perform? He knew 
his place. 

But they had told him about 
Freddie — or Mr. Davidson, their 
spokesman, had — and he owed 
them something for that, for the 
one brief moment in which they 
had shoved back the snow, the 
grim cold winter, the bleak build- 
ing and the smell of turnips, as a 
curtain, and revealed his own youth 
to him, sparkling with hope, with 
promise, with a life unfulfilled. 

No! 

Even that had been unkind. Pre- 
meditated? His lot would be all the 
more unpleasant for it. And Mrs. 


Friedlander’s. They’d sealed her in 
a half-mourning, half-hoping fu- 
ture. They’d ruined her whole life. 

He’d have to move, of course, 
with his wife. But perhaps they’d 
earn the right to a better neighbor- 
hood. He walked up the six snow- 
covered steps to the police station, 
went inside, sat down and started 
telling the uniformed figure at the 
desk about the subversives in his 
building who owned short-wave 
radios, starting with Mr. Davidson 
and going right on down the list. 
He hoped the Karadi would come 
and take them away before the 
funeral. • • •

AND GONE TOMORROW (Continued from page 49) 


I’ll join ’em. Why — why die a 
martyr’s death?” 

Of course, Jay told himself. Logi- 
cal. But Kevin had been so con- 
vinced. So utterly sure. Now he 
looked and sounded like a disil- 
lusioned old man. 

“Kevin, I’m not trying to rub it 
in. But — ” 

“I know what you’re going to 
say. I was so sure. Paradise. I was 
a firm disciple. Convinced. I be- 
lieved in all of it. I — thought it 
would last forever. The perfect 
government. A permanently work- 
able government.” 

Jay sat quietly. Ilaria reached 
for the switch. 

“For God’s sake,” came the voice 
of 1954, “what is the perfect work- 
able government?” 

Ilaria closed the switch and the 
light blinded Jay. He felt as if 
someone had slugged him in the 


stomach. Slowly the machine pre- 
pared to send him back one-hun- 
dred years. It warmed up like a jet 
on a runway. 

The light faded and Jay opened 
his eyes. The building rocked. 
There was a terrific explosion and 
part of the steel wall buckled. 
Somewhere a woman screamed. A 
squadron of fighters hurtled past, 
spitting fire and death. A bomber 
fell, exploding as it crashed into 
a tall apartment building. Jay’s 
stomach twisted and he knew he 
was on his way. Ilaria took his gun 
from his holster and calmly placed 
its ugly snout against his own face. 

“. the perfect workable gov- 
vemment?” Jay’s question of a mo- 
ment ago reached his ears as he 
began to slip back, minute by 
minute, picking up momentum. 
Ilaria’s reply came dimly. 

“There is none.” • • •

LES MACHINES 


There are human beings who junction “like machines” and 
there are machines which seem to be “almost human”. So — 
the problem in this case was not murder, or who committed it 
but who was the “machine” and who was the “human being”. 


BY JOE LOVE 


O N JANUARY 5, 1997 Isobel 
Smith became Isobel Smith 
d’Larte. On November 13, 1997 
Isobel Smith d’Larte gave birth to 
a boy-child who died. And on 
March 20, 1998 Isobel Smith 

d’Larte was placed on trial for the 
willful and premeditated murder 
of her husband Arnaud d’Larte. 


“Not Isobel,” said her friends. 
“Not Isobel. Too mousey. So quiet. 
Surely it wasn’t Isobel.” 

“But it’s the quiet type you’ve 
got to watch out for,” said others. 
“Probably has a lover somewhere. 
She was younger than her husband 
you know. Much younger. Too 
much younger.”

“Killed him for his money/’ 
said the people on the street. “Read 
where she likes art and museums, 
stuff like that. Must be a queer one 
that Isobel d’Larte.” 

The accusations piled high 
against Isobel, but she said noth- 
ing. She sat in court, a tiny figure 
in black saying nothing, seemingly 
not even listening to the accusa- 
tions of the Prosecutor. 

“We will prove willful and pre- 
meditated murder,” the Prosecu- 
tor thundered. 

“Easily done,” an old woman in 
the audience murmured spitefully. 
“Young wife, old husband. Rich 
husband. Murder! Easily proved.” 

“First witness,” the Prosecutor 
called. “Sergeant Melot.” 

Sergeant Melot took the stand. 
The witness chair creaked under 
his weight. He answered a loud, “I 
do,” when the clerk swore him in. 

“Tell us about finding the body,” 
the Prosecutor said. “Miss no de- 
tails.” 

“A Mrs. Watson, servant of Ar- 
naud d’Larte, called us at nine 
five P.M. on March 15. Her 
master was dead, she said. When 
we answered her call we found Mr. 
d’Larte’s body in his bedroom. He 
had been dead for about an hour.” 

“The cause?” 

“Beaten to death. Beaten with an 
iron statue of Venus. Evidence of 
a struggle. Twenty wounds on his 
head.” 

“Twenty wounds, Sergeant Me- 
lot?” 

“Twenty. The first, or second, 
would have been enough to kill 
him. But there were twenty.” 

The audience gasped and the 
Prosecutor smiled. “And where 
was Mrs. d’Larte?” he asked. 


“Locked in her bedroom. Had 
to break the door down to get to 
her.” 

“Did you speak to her?” 

“We spoke to her, but she didn’t 
speak to us.” 

The audience laughed and the 
judge rapped for silence. 

“The iron statue of Venus, the 
one found near Mr. d’Larte’s body, 
you found fingerprints on it, did 
you not?” Sergeant Melot nodded. 
“Whose fingerprints were they, 
Sergeant Melot?” 

“Mrs. d’Larte’s.” 

“Your witness,” the Prosecutor 
told the Defense. 

“No questions,” said the Defense. 
“Why ask questions,” a specta- 
tor commented. “She’s guilty.” 
“Next witness.” 

“Mrs. Abby Watson to the stand 
please.” 

Abby Watson strode to the wit- 
ness chair. Her shrew-like eyes 
flicked sharply towards Isobel 
d’Larte then away. Her answer to 
the clerk who swore her in was 
sharp and positive. 

“How long have you worked for 
Mr. d’Larte?” the Prosecutor asked. 
“Fifteen years.” 

“In your opinion Mr. d’Larte 
was a good employer?” 

“The best. A wonderful man, but 
a lonely one. That woman tricked 
him into marriage. Played on his 
loneliness.” 

“Objection.” 

“Objection sustained. Confine 
yourself to the questions please.” 
“Mr. d’Larte was older than his 
wife?” the Prosecutor asked. 
“Eighteen years older.” 

“Was it a happy marriage?” 

“At first, at least on his part. He 
was contented, but she seemed 


106 


JOE LOVE 



restless. Always wanted to go to 
museums and see paintings, or 
playing her silly antique records all 
day. Not content with the govern- 
ment ‘Do-It-Yourself’ kits. Called 
them mechanical and expression- 
less. She insulted Mr. d’Larte’s 
friends time and again. Called 
them frauds. Said their paintings, 
books and plays were terrible. Said 
that real talent was dead. 

“You said she spent a lot of time 
in museums?” 

“I didn’t say it, but she did. 
Every chance she got. She’d be 
gone for hours.” 

“Which museum? The one com- 
memorating the wars? The Mu- 
seum of Mechanics?” 

“None of those. She’d go to the 
old one on the hill. That horrible 
thing with the relics of the past in 
it. The one run by the robots. The 
one run by the government to re- 
mind us of the past when only a 
few were allowed talent and not 
everybody like today. But I think 
she went to the museum for an- 
other reason. No one could really 
be interested in those things they 
have there.” 

“What do you think she went 
for, Mrs. Watson?” 

“To meet her lover. Shortly be- 
fore he was killed Mr. d’Larte con- 
fessed to me that he was of the 
same opinion.” 

“See, I told you she had a lover,” 
someone whispered. “Old husband, 
young wife. I just knew there was 
a lover.” 

“Objection,” said the Defense. 
“There is no proof that Mrs. 
d’Larte went to the museum to 
meet a lover. There are only opin- 
ions, guesses.” 

“If your honor will permit me 
LES MACHINES 


to call my next witness I think I 
can prove that there was a lover,” 
the Prosecutor said. 

The judge leaned forward in 
eager anticipation. “Call your wit- 
ness.” 

“Bella Whychek.” 

A fat, dumpy, flame-haired wom- 
an made her way to the witness 
stand. As she was sworn in she 
tugged self-consciously at her too 
tight girdle. 

“Miss Whychek—” 

“Mrs. I’m a widow.” 

“Mrs. Whychek, would you tell 
us where you are employed.” 
“Timon’s and Sons. I’m a secre- 
tary there.” 

“And where is your office lo- 
cated.” 

“In the building just across the 
street from the Museum of the 
Past — the one you were just talk- 
ing about to that other woman.” 
“Mrs. Whychek, do you recog- 
nize the woman sitting over there?” 
the Prosecutor asked as he pointed 
to Isobel d’Larte. 

“Indeed I do. I saw her most 
everyday.” 

“Would you tell us the circum- 
stances.” 

“Well, from the window in my 
office I have a very good view of 
the park that is next to the mu- 
seum. About a month ago I began 
noticing that woman in the park. 
I couldn’t help but notice her, she 
came so often.” 

“Alone, Mrs. Whychek?” 

“At first yes. She’d go into the 
museum, stay about two hours or 
so, then come out and sit in the 
park. She never did anything but 
sit.” 

“Was she always alone?” 

“I was just coming to that. After 

107 



about a week I noticed that a man 
would come and sit with her in the 
park.” 

“Could you describe the man?” 
“No, I’m afraid I couldn’t. He 
always wore a long overcoat and a 
hat pulled down over his face. Both 
the overcoat and the hat were very 
old though. I did notice that. They 
looked like they might have dated 
from around 1950.” 

“And what did this man and 
Mrs. d’Larte do in the park?” 
“Just sat. Talked I guess. I never 
saw them kiss or anything if that’s 
what you mean. Of course many 
times they would still be sitting 
there when I left work. What they 
did after that I don’t know.” 

“But Mrs. d’Larte definitely did 
meet a man in the park.” 

“Oh, yes. She met him nearly 
every day for almost a month.” 
“Thank you. Your witness.” 

The Defense rose slowly and 
walked over to where Mrs. Why- 
chek sat. 

“Remember you are under oath, 
Mrs. Whychek,” he said. “You say 
Mrs. d’Larte and this man merely 
sat and talked?” 

“As far as I could tell that’s all 
they did. Of course I didn’t watch 
them every minute.” 

“Then you can say that they 
never did anything out of the way, 
that their meetings, if they were 
that, were innocent?” 

“As far as I could tell they 
were.” 

“Could you say whether the 
meetings were prearranged?” 

“I really couldn’t, but — ” 

“That will be all, thank you,” 
the Defense interrupted. 

So the first day of the trial went. 
There seemed no doubt that Isobel 


d’Larte was guilty. Her friends ad- 
mitted loudly that poor Isobel had 
scandalized them to the core. The 
papers labeled Isobel queer and 
hinted that her lover, whoever he 
might be, killed Mr. d’Larte for 
her. Old fashioned Isobel, they 
called her. Some had other names 
for her. 

O N THE SECOND day of the 
trial the Defense called its wit- 
nesses. There were only three. Two 
were character witnesses who hesi- 
tantly assured the court that Isobel 
d’Larte could not have killed her 
husband. She really was a good 
woman. 

The third witness was Isobel her- 
self. When she was called she rose 
very slowly and walked to the wit- 
ness stand. She was sworn in and 
seated herself in the witness chair. 
Her face and hands were chalk 
white against the blackness of her 
dress. 

“Mrs. d’Larte, did you kill your 
husband?” the Defense asked. 
“No.” 

“Do you know who did kill your 
husband?” 

“No.” 

“Why did you lock yourself in 
your bedroom the night he was 
killed.” 

“I wanted to be alone.” 

The spectators giggled. 

“Could you explain how your 
fingerprints came to be on the iron 
statue of Venus? The statue that 
killed your husband.” 

“It was my statue. It is quite 
possible that my fingerprints would 
be on it.” 

“And you heard nothing, no 
sounds of struggle, the night your 

JOE LOVE 


108 



husband was killed?” 

“No. I slept awhile that night. I 
was tired so I locked my door and 
slept. I heard nothing.” 

“Do you know who would want 
to kill your husband?” 

“An enemy I suppose.” 

“Did your husband have any 
enemies?” 

“Of course, everyone does. Even 
God has enemies.” 

That shocked the spectators, but 
then Isobel had meant it to. Quite 
suddenly she found herself hating 
those in the packed court room. 
Hating these upright citizens who 
had come to delight in her mis- 
fortune. Who sat in smug holier- 
than-thou attitudes and hoped for 
the worst. Not one among them 
really cared what happened to her 
— as long as it entertained them. 
Isobel shivered. 

“Could you be more specific 
about your husband’s enemies?” 
the Defense asked. 

“No. He never confided in me. 
He was only interested in his mu- 
nitions factories. In machines. He 
loved machines. He particularly 
loved destructive machines. Some 
hated him for that.” 

“The man Mrs. Whychek said 
you met in the park. Was there 
such a man?” 

Isobel twisted her handkerchief. 
It was a thin, white snake in her 
hands. 

“Was there a man, Mrs. 
d’Larte?” the Defense repeated. 
“There was a man.” 

“Could you tell us his name?” 

“I do not know his name. He 
was a man I met in the park. He 
was a kind and gentle man. We 
talked about art, music — the beau- 
tiful old art and music. He was 


well informed about such things. 
We talked a lot, but I don’t know 
his name. We just talked.” 

“Were you in love with this man, 
or he with you?” 

“No! No!” 

“You definitely were not lovers?” 
“We were not!” 

“Thank you, Mrs. d’Larte. Your 
witness.” 

The Prosecutor approached the 
witness stand. “Mrs. d’Larte, you 
do not like the ‘Do-It-Yourself’ kits 
the government has put out, do 
you?” 

“I do not.” 

“You do not approve or recog- 
nize the fact that today everyone is 
conceded to have talent, do you?” 
“I do not.” 

“Why, Mrs. d’Larte?” 

“Anyone can paint, but everyone 
isn’t an artist. Anyone can write, 
but everyone isn’t an author. Any- 
one can do anything, but everyone 
does not have talent.” 

“So you spent a great deal of 
your time in the Museum of the 
Past looking at the so-called art 
treasures there?” 

“Yes. They were worth looking 
at.” 

“And you did not use that to 
cover up the fact that you met your 
lover at the museum?” 

“I do not have a lover.” 

“The man you met in the park, 
you just talked to him?” 

“We talked about the wonderful, 
the beautiful things in the museum. 
He knew about them and loved 
them as I did. There was no one 
else I could talk to about them.” 
“Naturally,” the Prosecutor 
sneered. “Everyone else knows what 
frauds they are.” 

The spectators laughed.

“Then I like the frauds,” Isobel 
said quietly. 

“You claim you were in your 
bedroom with the door locked and 
asleep when Mr. d’Larte was killed. 
Is that right?” 

“That is right.” 

“And even though your bedroom 
is right next to Mr. d’Larte’s you 
heard nothing. Is that right?” 
“Yes.” 

“Your husband struggled, strug- 
gled hard before he died, Mrs. 
d’Larte. You’ll forgive me if I seem 
skeptical of the fact that you heard 
nothing.” 

“I was asleep. I heard nothing.” 
“No cry? No crashes?” 

“I heard nothing!” 

“And the man in the park — he 
was not your lover?” 

“He was not my lover.” 

The Prosecutor turned to the 
judge with a grim smile. “Your 
honor, I request a recess so that I 
may bring in a new witness.” 

“This witness is not in the court 
room?” 

“No. I myself only learned of 
him a few minutes ago. It will take 
about a half-hour to bring him 
here.” 

“And this witness is important?” 
“Yes. I believe he can prove that 
Mrs. d’Larte is lying.” 

“Then this court is recessed un- 
til the prosecution brings in the 
new witness.” 

The spectators buzzed and jib- 
bered excitedly. A new witness. A 
surprise witness. The trial was real- 
ly becoming interesting. 

“I hate to leave. I really hate to 
leave,” one said to her companion. 
“I’ll never get back in if I leave. 
But one must eat. I hate to leave.” 
“No need. No need to leave,” 


the companion assured her. “See, 
I brought sandwiches. Always bring 
something to eat to things like this. 
People crowd so. It’s really terrible. 
Have an egg?” 

“Pretty good trial,” an old man 
with a white beard told the person 
next to him. “Not as good as the 
Bronson trial, but pretty good.” 

“You’ve seen a lot of trials?” the 
figure next to him asked. 

“Seen all the good ones,” the one 
with the beard said proudly. “Saw 
the Bronson trial in ’96, the Trea- 
mont trial in ’94. Saw a lot of trials. 
First time that I’ve seen one where 
a wife killed her husband. Most of 
the others involved infanticide. 
Good trials, you understand, but 
disappointing. All the verdicts were 
not guilty.” 

“Naturally. With over-population 
infanticide isn’t a crime. Rather’ 
more like a good deed these days.” 

“Understand they are going to 
legalize the killing of unwanted 
children.” 

“Should have been done long 

___ 

ago. 

“People should be more careful. 
If they don’t want children, they 
should be more careful.” 

“If you know you can get rid of 
them, why be careful?” 

A woman fanned herself with 
her pocketbook and glanced at her 
companion. “Have another sand- 
wich, dear?” 

“No, on a diet you know.” The 
companion sighed. “It’s too bad 
that they abolished capital punish- 
ment. Believe me, this d’Larte hussy 
deserves it.” 

“But it’s so much better the way 
they do it now, I mean sending the 
guilty to the wars to fight in the 
front lines. Might as well get some 

JOE LOVE 


no 



use out of them.” 

“True. But why bother killing a 
husband? Divorcing them is so 
much easier. Only takes a day and 
you get half the husband’s earn- 
ings” 

“You should know, dear. You’ve 
done it enough.” 

“Only seven times.” 

“I thought it was eight?” 

“I don’t count Rodger. The lout 
killed himself so he wouldn’t have 
to pay me a settlement. Ah, here 
comes the judge.” 

T HE SPECTATORS stood lazi- 
ly as the judge entered, then re- 
seated themselves and buzzed in 
anticipation. 

“Your witness has arrived?” the 
judge asked. 

“Yes, Your Honor,” the Prosecu- 
tor replied. 

“Then call him.” 

The witness was called and 
sworn in as the spectators gawked 
at him eagerly. 

“Good looking. Dark. Evil eyes 
though. Black eyes. I like dark eyes, 
don’t you?” 

“Dark blue coat. Lime green 
sports shirt. Nice combination. 
Must have a suit made with those 
colors.” 

“Nasty look about that fellow. 
Wouldn’t trust him.” 

“Who is he?” 

“Shhhhhhhhhh !” 

Isobel d’Larte stared at the wit- 
ness in fear. 

“Your name, please,” the Prose- 
cutor demanded of the witness. 
“Andy Kirk.” 

“You are Mr. d’Larte’s nephew?” 
“Yep.” 

“What do you do for a living, 
LES MACHINES 


Mr. Kirk?” 

“Anything, but basically I’m an 
artist.” 

“Is that what you are doing at 
the present time, Mr. Kirk?” 

“No. Everybody’s an artist today. 
No room for a good one, a real 
one.” 

“Then what do you do, Mr. 
Kirk?” the Prosecutor asked in ex- 
asperation. 

“Don’t shout. I didn’t ask to 
come here.” 

“What do you do for a living?” 
the Prosecutor asked quietly. 

“Arnaud — Mr. d’Larte — paid me 
to follow his wife. To spy on her. 
He paid very well.” 

The spectators gasped happily. 
“Now we’ll hear something,” some- 
one said in a stage whisper. The 
judge rapped for silence. 

“Why did Mr. d’Larte pay you 
to follow his wife?” 

“He thought she had a lover.” 
“But you heard Mrs. d’Larte 
claim that she did not have a 
lover.” 

“No, I didn’t. How could I? I 
wasn’t here.” 

Laughter rippled through the 
crowded room and the judge 
rapped for silence. 

The Prosecutor frowned angrily. 
“Mrs. d’Larte said under oath that 
she did not have a lover.” 

“She lied.” 

“Can you prove that she lied?” 
“I suppose so.” 

“And they were really lovers?” 
“Mrs. d’Larte told me that she 
loved him.” 

“And he loved her I suppose.” 
“Mrs. d’Larte loved him.” 

“How long were they lovers?” 
“Nearly a month.” 

“I repeat, can you prove it?” 


Ill 



“I can tell you who her lover is.” 

“Then by all means do so.” 

“No! Please, no,” Isobel d’Larte 
cried. “I killed my husband.” 

When order had been restored 
in the court the judge stared down 
at Isobel. 

“Am I to understand that you 
confess to the murder of Arnaud 
d’Larte?” 

“Yes,” Isobel said softly. “I hated 
him and I killed him. I killed with 
the iron statue of Venus. I hit him 
with it till he died and I hit him 
with it after he was dead. I killed 
him.” 

Andy Kirk smiled. 

It only took a short time to bring 
in a verdict of guilty against Isobel 
d’Larte. She accepted the verdict 
silently and without flinching. In 
like manner she accepted her sen- 
tence. She was to be sent to fight 
in the front lines of the war in 
Asia. 

“I declare this court adjourned,” 
the judge said and banged his gavel 
down authoritatively. 

As Isobel d’Larte was taken from 
the room she was led passed Andy 
Kirk. Seeing him, she stopped and 
stared at him coldly. 

“Why did you do this to me?” 
she asked. 

“To help you. If the trial had 
continued the way it had you would 
have been judged insane and exe- 
cuted here in the States. In Asia 
you may have a chance.” 

“Does it make a difference if I 
have a chance? No one really 
cares.” 

“You may find what you’ve been 
looking for over there.” 

“You think so?” 

“I hope so.” 

“I don’t understand you, Andy.” 


“Sometimes one must do bad to 
do good.” 

Isobel stared at him not under- 
standing his words, then the guard 
led her away. Isobel d’Larte spent 
the night in jail, and the next 
morning, along with twenty other 
prisoners, was taken to the rocket- 
port to be sent to Asia. At the 
rocket-port the prisoners were al- 
lowed to say their goodbyes to their 
families without the benefit of 
guards. Isobel stood alone watch- 
ing the tearful farewells, then 
walked slowly into the cafeteria. As 
she sat alone at the corner table 
drinking coffee a tall man dressed 
in an old fashioned top coat and 
with an old fashioned hat pulled 
down over his face walked up to 
the table and sat down opposite 
her. Isobel looked at the figure hap- 
pily. 

“I knew you would come.” 

“Why did you confess?” 

“I did not want them to know 
about us. They would have made 
it all so ugly sounding. They would 
have made it sound vile . and it 
wasn’t.” Isobel reached out a hand 
towards the figure and a metal hand 
closed over hers. “I didn’t want 
them to harm you.” 

“You did it for me?” 

“Yes. I love you.” 

“I’m a robot. A machine. An un- 
feeling thing of iron and steel. How 
can you love me?” 

“My husband was the machine. 
He ate at the same time everyday, 
dressed at the same time, went to 
work at the same time. He did the 
same things, thought the same 
things everyday of his life.” 

“But he had emotion.” 

“Only those he had been taught 
to feel and those only at the proper 

JOE LOVE 


112 



times. He was mad when he should 
be mad and happy when he should 
be happy, nothing more. He was 
much more of a machine than 
you.” 

“But I cannot return your love. 
I do not know what emotion is.” 

“I had to have someone,” Isobel 
cried. “I had to have someone who 
was kind to me. You liked what I 
liked. You could talk to me of 
something besides machines. Ma- 
chines do everything now. But you 
could talk to me of art, music, 
beauty.” 

“My creator taught me those 
things. Taught me to care for those 
things in the museum. I would miss 
them if they were taken away.” 

“Yes.” Sudden tears stung Iso- 
bel’s eyes. No one would miss her. 
No one would care about her. 

“I will miss you too, Isobel. I 
will miss you very much.” * 


“As much as the things in the 
museum?” 

“As much as those. More.” 

Isobel stood up, leaned over and 
kissed the metal cheek of the one 
opposite her. “Then it was worth 
it.” 

“All prisoners assemble on the 
runway,” a harsh voice boomed 
over the loudspeaker. 

“Perhaps someday I call learn to 
return love,” the robot said. 

“You have done more than that. 
You have made me happy.” 

“Come back safely, Isobel.” 
Isobel d’Larte ran to the runway 
and joined the other prisoners. 
They looked at her strangely not 
understanding her smile. Isobel 
barely noticed them, for she was 
happy. Someone cared for her. 
That was the important thing. 
Someone cared. • • • 


THE JUNGLE (Continued from page 24) 


He stood by the door, listening 
to his heart rattle crazily in his 
chest. 

He opened the door. 

The apartment was calm, silent. 
The walls glowed around the 
framed Miros and Mondrians and 
Picassos. The furniture sat func- 
tionally on the silky white rug, 
black thin-legged chairs and ta- 
bles . 

Austin started to laugh, care- 
fully checked himself. He knew he 
probably would not be able to stop. 

He thought strongly about 
Tcheletchew, and of the men who 
would come to Mbarara in the 
morning. He thought of the city 

LES MACHINES 


teeming with life. Of the daylight 
streaming onto the streets of peo- 
ple, the shops, the churches, the 
schools. His work. His dream . 

He walked across the rug to the 
bedroom door. 

It was slightly ajar. 

He pushed it, went inside, closed 
it softly. 

“Mag,” he whispered. “Mag — ” 

There was a noise. A low, throaty 
rumble. Not of anger; of warning. 

Richard Austin came close to 
the bed, adjusted his eyes to the 
black light. 

Then he screamed. 

It was the first time he had ever 
watched a lion feeding. • • •

SCIENCE 




Strange aircraft you may be see- 
ing any day now are not Martian. 
British designers have come up with 
a radical new wing design — the 
crescent shaped wing — different 
from anything now breaking the 
sound barrier. Used either curving 
forward or curving toward the 
back of the ship they make a 
strange spectacle indeed. But claims 
are that they make for much less 
wind resistance . and much more 
stability. 

Summer vacation clothes may soon 
include disposable bathing suits. A 
specially processed wall paper has 
been found to have high “wet 
strength” and several feminine 
bathing suits have been made of it 
and are undergoing strenuous tests 
this year. 

Transoceanic information radioed 
from one punch card to another 
will be an invaluable business bless- 
ing in the near future. A recent ex- 
periment had information originat- 
ing in North Africa received in 
Washington, D.G. faster, more ac- 
curately and more economically 
than any previous system of trans- 
mitting such detailed statistical 
data. A machine operator loaded a 
data tranceiver with cards contain- 
ing information recorded as 

114 


punched holes in the cards. As the 
tranceiver “read” the cards, it gen- 
erated electronic impulses represent- 
ing the holes. The impulses sent by 
radio actuated the punching mech- 
anism of a tranceiver set up in 
Washington which created exact 
duplicates of the cards fed into the 
North African machine; thus sup- 
plying a punch card immediately 
available for machine processing, 
and eliminating several steps in ac- 
counting procedure. 

Moving coal, iron ore and other 
raw materials may someday be 
done by a system of endless belts 
set up across the country. A work- 
ing model of just such a belt con- 
veyor has already been designed to 
link Lake Erie with the Ohio River 
one hundred miles away. If legis- 
lation can be passed to give the belt 
the status of a common carrier, it 
will be built to shuttle iron ore and 
coal from river barges to Great 
Lake carriers or to storage bins. 

Travelling employees may get an 

earful or instructions in the future 
through a new vest pocket radio 
that resembles a hearing aid. Pow- 
ered by two pen-sized flashlight 
cells that work for a month, and 
with a loud-speaker that is worn 
like a hearing aid earpiece, this 
midget marvel can be tuned to “re- 
ceive” certain wavelengths. The 
boss can “broadcast” instructions 
without interference; and channels 
could be modified to decimal 
places so that there would be no 
crossed instructions possible. 

The key to future immortality may 
not lie in drugs, beneficial rays or 
electrical vibrations but in austerity. 
Science has been making some 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



rather extensive tests that seem to 
prove that abstinence from such 
vices as smoking, drinking of alco- 
holic beverages and tea and coffee, 
sweet and fatty foods and sexual 
activity prolongs the life of in- 
dividuals. 

Electrical companies may be own- 
ing and operating their own atomic 
power plants within the next ten 
years. Introduction of the light 
water-moderated and cooled boiling 
reactor and the graphite-moderated 
water-cooled reactor have made 
early effective competition with 
conventional fuel plants both very 
possible and much more economi- 
cal. 

Remote areas of the world may 
someday be the sites of atomic age 
pyramids. Such “tombs” would be 
the burial grounds of radioactive 
waste fission products from atomic 
power plants. Assuming that atomic 
power will be coming into wide- 
spread use by the end of the cen- 
tury, there would be three tons of 
“hot” waste from the many reactors 
to be disposed of each day. Science 
believes that we shall need to iso- 
late and control such waste in des- 
ert “burial grounds” to solve the 
menace that this type of waste 
poses. 

Space explorers may find that the 
canals of Mars are really long nar- 
row drifts of volcanic ash. Accord- 
ing to a new theory based on a pat- 
tern of the prevailing winds on 
Mars, the dark green markings may 
be streaks of drifts made by the 
winds during the Martian summers. 
Such ash would be green because 
of the dry oxygen-poor atmosphere. 
The theory further expounds the 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 


idea that such conditions would cor- 
respond to early stages in the de- 
velopment of Earth; and the red 
planet may possibly be one on 
which oceans have yet to form, and 
which life has yet to appear. 

Cities of the future may be hiring 
electronic watchmen. One already 
in operation in New York City is 
concentrating its tubes and wires 
upon the changing demands for 
electrical power. It takes into con- 
sideration short time demands that 
come and go continuously and in- 
creases power generation as the 
sustained load goes up. All of this 
is done automatically, efficiently 
and economically. Other “watch- 
men” for a myriad number of 
other jobs of the same type are un- 
der serious consideration. 

A look at the future of atomic 
power indicates that power plants 
will run on liquid metals which will 
supply fuel, control the reaction 
and transfer the heat out where it 
can be utilized. Lead, bismuth and 
tin or combinations of these 
“lighter” metals will be used. 
Studies are now being made to 
work out a method whereby the 
liquids would clean themselves of 
“ashes” of debris. This new kind 
of atomic power plant would not 
only use uranium for power, but 
would constantly provide uranium 
anew from less valuable Thorium, 
which can be bred into U 233 and 
then fissioned. 

Weather forecasts “untouched by 
human hands” are part of a plan 
for the future. Some weathermen 
foresee a time when required data 
on winds, temperatures and pres- 
sures will be automatically record- 

115 



ed, then relayed by radio directly 
to a computer for calculation of 
forthcoming weather. Using nu- 
merical weather prediction a giant 
brain could then make forecasts as 
far in advance as thirty days. 

A mechanical cougher, which oper- 
ates like two vacuum cleaners alter- 
nately blowing air into the lungs 
and sucking it out again, may some- 
day be used to save thousands of 
lives. An experimental working 
model has already been tried on 
babies, older children and grown-, 
ups who accidentally inhaled but- 
tons, pins, fishbones and so on. This 
new “cougher” has the advantage 
over the bronchoscope now in use in 
that it can reach places inaccessible 
to the instruments now used. 

The toughest armor of all was 

given to Earth by Mother Nature. 
It is air — plain everyday air — the 
kind we breathe. And here’s how 
it performs the function of the 
“world’s toughest armor.” 

Millions of potentially devastat- 
ing “bombs” from outer space shoot 
with deathly force and incredible 
speed at the face of the Earth. 
These “bombs” are meteors, be- 
lieved to be debris from comets, 
which head for Earth at speeds up 


to 50 miles per second and in such 
masses that an entire city could be 
destroyed. However, as the bom- 
bardment of meteors hits the 
Earth’s atmosphere, about 200 
miles up, the resistance is too much 
and the meteors disintegrate, break- 
ing up into fractions of their orig- 
inal size and burning themselves 
out in tails of fire. The biggest 
known meteorite (as they are 
called after they land) to hit the 
Earth landed in Kansas in 1930. It 
weighed 820 pounds; other pieces 
of the same meteorite found in that 
area weighed up to 80 pounds. 

Hoarseness is not to be taken too 
lightly. According to a report from 
the Illinois State Medical Society, 
it can be caused by more than 100 
different diseases which affect the 
delicate vocal cords. Hoarseness is 
symtomatic of a number of things, 
such as colds, cheering or talking 
long and loud, too much smoking, 
or any of a number of ordinary 
causes. It can also be the signal 
that a malignancy has developed — 
tuberculosis, tumor or cancer. Seri- 
ous hoarseness can be associated 
with diseases of the heart and brain. 
So if you have a case of hoarseness 
that hangs on unduly long, see your 
doctor.

WORTH CITING 

1 An international language whose words and sounds could be | 
1 understood by all men, regardless of the native tongue they speak | 

| every day, has long been a goal. Over three hundred such lan- | 

| guages have been invented in the last century, but none has be- | 

| come a real tool for communication and understanding between 1 

| nations. | 

1 Now, a new tool is making it’s debut. Not really new in the | 
| words it uses, it has its roots in many languages. It uses the vo- 1 

| cabulary of science and technology, which is common to almost | 

1 all world languages. It uses English root words where they are | 

| common to other languages and it has borrowed from the Ro- 1 

| mance languages, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, etc. The | 

| troublesome intricacies of grammar have been discarded. There § 

| is only one word form in each tense; and nouns, adjectives and 1 

| verbs do not agree as they must in more complex tongues. Mil- | 

1 lions will find the vocabulary basically familiar, for it is not a | 

| new artificial language but one that uses the tools already at hand f 

| in simple uncomplicated ways. ! 

| For those who feel that peace in the world will come closer 1 
1 if people talk to one another in a language all mankind can un- | 

| derstand, this “breaking” of the language barrier has a very great | 

| appeal. So this month we cite 1NTERL1NGU A, a new auxiliary \ 

1 language for all the world. A natural language that has its roots | 

| in the national tongues of all nations. |
