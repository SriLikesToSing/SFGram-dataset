Herbert Oeorge Morley Roberts Wells, ESQ. 

by ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



A couple of years ag-o I wrote a 
tale accurately entitled The 
Longest Science Fiction Story Ever 
Told, which Fred Pohl duly pub- 
lished on a single page of Galaxy 
(Because editors have to justify 
their existence somehow, he re- 
named it “A Recursion in Metastor- 
ies.” You’ll find it in Galaxy for 
October, 1966). Near the beginning 
of this metastory, but an infinite 
number of words from its end, I 
referred to The Anticipator by H. 
G. Wells. 

Though I encountered this short 
fantasy some twenty years ago and 
have never read it since, it left a 
vivid impression on my mind. It 
concerned two writers, one of whom 
had all his best stories published by 
the other — before he could even 
complete them himself. At last, in 
desperation, he decided that murder 



was the only cure for this chronic 
(literally) plagiarism. 

But, of course, once again his 
rival beat him to it — and the story 
ends with the words: “The antici- 
pator, horribly afraid, ran down a 
by-street.” 

Now, I would have sworn on a 
stack of Bibles that this story was 
written by H. G. Wells. However, 
some months after its appearance 
I received a letter from Leslie A. 
Gritten of Everett, Washington, 
saying that he couldn't locate it. 
And Mr. Gritten has been a Wells 
fan for a long, long time — he 
clearly recalls the serialization of 
The War of the Worlds in the 
Strand Magazine at the end of the 
'90’s. As one of the Master's cock- 
ney characters would say, Gor Bli- 
mey. 

Refusing to believe that my men- 



4 




tal filing- system had played such 
a dirty trick on me, I quickly 
searched through the 20-odd vol- 
umes of the autographed Atlantic 
Edition in the Colombo Public Li- 
brary. (By a charming coincidence, 
the British Council had just ar- 
ranged a Wells Centenary Exhibi- 
tion, and the library entrance was 
festooned with photos illustrating 
his background and career.) I soon 
found that Mr. Gritten was right: 
there was no such story as The An- 
ticipator in the collect^ works. Yet 
in the months since TLSFSET was 
published, not one reader has quer- 
ied the reference. I find this de- 
pressing; where are all the Wells 
fans these days? 

Now my erudite informant has 
solved at least part of the mystery. 
The Anticipator was written by one 
Morley Roberts; it was first pub- 
lished in 1898 in The Keeper of the 
Waters (and other stories). I prob- 
ably encountered it in a Doubleday 
anthology, Travellers in Time 
(1947) edited by Phillip van Doren 
Stern. 

Yet several problems remain. 
First of all, why was I so convinced 
that the story was by Wells? I can 
only suggest — and it seems pretty 
far-fetched, even for my grasshop- 
per mind — that the similarity of 
words made me link it subconscious- 
ly with The New Accelerator. 

I would also like to know why this 
story has stuck so vividly in my 
memory. Perhaps, like all writers, I 
am peculiarly sensitive to the dan- 
gers of plagiarism. So far (touch 
wood) I have been lucky; but I 
have notes for several tales I’m 
afraid to write until I can be quite 
sure they’re original. (There’s this 
couple, see, who land their space- 



ship on a new world after their 
planet has been blown up, and when 
they’ve started things all over again 
you find — surprise, surprise — 
that they’re called Adam and Eve.) 

One worthwhile result of my error 
was to start me skimming through 
Wells’s short stories again, and I 
was surprised to find what a rela- 
tively small proportion could be 
called science fiction, or even fan- 
tasy. Although I was well aware 
that only a fraction of his 100-odd 
volumes were S.F., I had forgotten 
that this was also true of the short 
stories. A depressing quantity are 
dramas and comedies of Edwardian 
life (The Jilting of Jane), rather 
painful attempts at humor (My 
First Aeroplane), near-autobiogra- 
phy (A Slip Under the Microscope) 
or pure sadism (The Cone). Un- 
doubtedly, I am biased, but among 
these tales such masterpieces as 
The Star, The Crystal Egg, The 
Flowering of the Strange Orchid 
— and, above all The Country of the 
Blind — blaze like diamonds amid 
costume jewelry. 

But back to Morley Robert. I 
know nothing whatsoever about him 
and wonder if his little excursion 
in time was itself inspired by The 
Time Machine, published just a 
couple of years before The Anti- 
cipator. I also wondered which story 
was actually written — not pub- 
lished — first. 

And why did such an ingenious 
writer not make more of a name 
for himself? Perhaps — 

I have just been struck by a 
perfectly horrid thought. If H. G. 
Wells’s contemporary Morley Rob- 
erts was ever found murdered in 
a dark alley, I simply don’t want to 
know about it. — Arthur C. Clarke

Judgment Fled 



by JAMES WHITE 



The alien ship swung in orbit, 
outside Jupiter. Earth had to 
launch Jts tiny ships to m^t it! 



Illustrated by 
MORROW 



I 

I t all began with a small scratch on 
a time exposure of some star 
clouds in Sagittarius, and its presence 
was blamed on mishandling or faulty 
processing. But a second exposure 
of the same area showed a similar 
scratch which began where the first 
one had left off and traced a path 
which was unmistaTcably curved, in- 
dicating that it was altering its own 
trajectory and could not therefore be 
a natural celestial body* 

Immediately every instrument 
which could be brought to bear, was 
directed at the Ship. 

The largest optical instruments 
showed only a point of light; spectro- 
analysis indicated a highly reflective 
surface suggestive of metal, and the 
great bowls of the radio telescopes 



gathered nothing at all. By this time 
the Ship had taken up an orbit some 
twelve million miles beyond the or- 
bit of Mars, still without making any 
attempt to communicate, and the de- 
cision was taken to sacrifice the 
Jupiter probe in an attempt to gain 
more information about the intruder. 

As a result there was relayed back 
to Earth a low-defii ition picture of 
the vessel which orbited silently and, 
some thought, implacably like some 
tremendous battleship cruising off 
the coast of a tiny, backward island. 
It made no signal. Nor did it reply in 
any recognizable fashion to those 
which were -;ng made. For the 
probe’s instruments showed the ob- 
ject to be metallic, shaped like a 
blunt topedo with a pattern of bulges 
encircling its mid-section and just 
under half a mile long. 

Inevitably there were those who 








wanted an even closer look, and two 
small, sophisticated dugout canoes 
were hastily modified and readied 
for launching. 

CCTt seems to me,” said Walters 
A very seriously, “that we have 
not gone far enough into the philo- 
sophical implications of this thing. 
At present that ship is a Mystery, 
but once we make contact it will then 
become a Problem. There’s a differ- 
ence, you know.” 

“Not really,” Berryman said in a 
matching tone. “A problem is simply 
a mystery which has been broken 
down into a number of handy pieces, 
some of which are usually related 
to problems already solved. And far 
be it from me to impugn the thought 
processes of a fellow officer, but 
your stand smacks of intellectual 
cowardice.” 



“Advocating a greater degree of 
caution and prior mental prepara- 
tion is not cowardice,” Walters re- 
turned. “If we’re to begin impugning 
minds it’s my opinion that too much 
confidence — you can call it bravery 
if you like — is in itself a form of 
instability which . 

“What sort of twisted mind is it 
that can insult a man by calling him 
brave?” said Berryman, laughing. “It 
seems to me everyone on this opera- 
tion wants to be the psychologist ex- 
cept the psychologist. What do you 
say. Doctor?” 

McCullough was silent for a mo 
ment. He was wondering what insen- 
sitive idiot it had been who had first 
likened the horrible sensation he was 
feeling in his stomach to butterflies. 
But he knew that the other two men 
were verbally whistling in the dark 
and in the circumstances he could 



7 



do nothing less than make it a trio. 
He said, ‘Tm not a psychologist. 
Anyway my couch is full at the mo- 
ment — I’m in it.” 

**Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,** 
said Control suddenly. ‘7 have to 
tell you that Colonel Morrison* s ship 
had a three-minute hold at minus 
eighteen minutes, so your takeoff 
will not now be simultaneous. Is this 
understood? Your own countdown is 
proceeding and is at minus sixty sec^ 
onds . nowl** 

“Command pilot here,” said Berry- 
man. “Understood. Tell the colonel 
last man to touch the alien ship is 
a — ” 

^Don*t you think you are all 
working a little too hard at project- 
ing the image of fearless, dedicated 
scientists ej^changing airy persiflage 
within seconds of being hurled into 
the 'unknown? Your upper lips must 
be ,so stiff Vm surprised you can 
still talk with them. Would you agree 
that you may be over-compensating 
for a temporary and quite under- 
standable anxiety neurosis? 

**Minus twenty seconds and count- 
ing .... Eighteen, seventeen six- 
teen ....** 

“You’re right, Walters,” said 
Berryman. ^''Everybody wants to be 
a psychologist!” 

**Twelve, eleven, ten .. .** 

“I want off,” said Walters. 

**At minus seven seconds? Are you 
kidding? Four, three, two, one ....** 
The acceleration built up until Mc- 
Cullough was sure his body could 
take no more, and still it increased. 
Even his eyes felt egg-shaped. His 
stomach seemed to be rammed tightly 
against his backbone. How anything 



as fragile as a butterfly could sur- 
vive such treatment surprised him, 
but they were still fluttering away 
like mad — until accelerating 
ceased and his vision cleared, that 
was, and he was able to look outside. 

Only then did they become still, 
paralyzed like himself with wonder. 

C ontrol and guidance during this 
most critical stage of the trip 
was the responsibility of brains both 
human and electronic on the ground. 
Their short period of weightlessness 
ended as the second stage ignited, its 
three G’s feeling almost comfortable 
after the beating he had taken on 
the way up. With his head still turned 
toward the port McCullough watched 
the splendor of the sunset line slide 
past below them to be replaced by 
the great, wooly darkness that was 
the cloud-covered Pacific. 

Against this velvet blackness a 
tiny shooting star fell away from 
rather than towards Earth — Morri- 
son’s ship. We knew it was the 
colonel’s ship because its flare died 
precisely three minutes after their 
own second stage cut out. 

If everything had gone as planned 
— a very big if, despite the advances 
made since Apollo — they were now 
on a collision course with the sixty- 
million-miles-distant Ship. A period 
of deceleration, already pre-calcu- 
lated, would insure that the collision 
would be a gentle one — if they 
managed to collide with it at all. 
For the alien vessel was a perfect 
example of a point in space. It had 
position but no magnitude, no de- 
tectable radiation, no gravitational 
field to help suck them in if their 



8 



IF 




course happened to be just a little 
off. 

The thought of missing the alien 
vessel completely or having to use so 
much fuel finding it that they might 
not be able to return home worried 
McCullough occasionally. Usually he 
tried, as he was doing now, to think 
about something else. 

He could no longer see Morrison’s 
ship. Either it was too small to be 
picked out by the naked eye — at 
least by McCullough’s middle-aged, 
slightly astigmatic naked eye — or 
it was hidden by the glare from the 
monsoon-season cloud blanket cover- 
ing Africa and the South Atlantic. 
But suddenly the colonel was very 
much with them. 

**P-One calling P-Two, Come in, 
P-Two. How do you read?** 

“P-Two here,” said Berryman and 
laughed. “Almost deafening, sir, and 
as clear as the notes of a silver trum- 
pet blowing the Last P . I mean 
Reveille . .” 

“Freudian slip,” murmured Wal- 
ters. 

'"Loud and clear is good enough, 
Berryman. Purple passages . waste 
oxygen. Have you completed check- 
ing your pressurization and life-sup- 
port system?** 

“Yes, sir. All are Go. 

*'Good. Take off your suits and all 
of you get some sleep as soon as pos- 
sible. Use medication if necessary. At 
the present time I consider it psy- 
chologically desirable for a number 
of reasons, so go to sleep before 
your nasty little subconsciouses re- 
alize they*ve left home. Thafs an 
order, gentlemen. Good night.** 

A few minutes later, while the 



other two were helping him out of 
his suit, Walters said drily, “Even 
the colonel wants to be one.” 

And Berryman added, “The trou- 
ble, Doctor, is that your psycholo- 
gist’s club is not sufficiently exclu- 
sive.” 

But the command pilot was wrong 
in one respect at least. McCullough 
now belonged to the most exclusive 
club on Earth, membership in which 
was reserved for that veay select 
group of individuals who at some 
time had left the aforementioned 
planet. And like all good clubs or 
monastic orders or crack regiments 
there were certain rules of behavior 
to follow. For even in the present 
day members could find tbemselvgi 
in serious trouble, very serious tf^iuh 
ble. 

When this happened they were^ 
supposed to follow precedents estab- 
lished by certain founder members 
who had been similarly unfortunate. 
They were expected to talk quietly 
and keep control of themselves until 
all hope was gone, then perhaps 
smash their radios so that their wives 
and friends would not be distressed 
by their shouting for the help which 
nobody could possibly give them 
when their air gave out or their ve- 
hicle began to melt around them on 
re-entry. 

During the five and a half 
months it would take them to reach 
the Ship they would eat, sleep, talk 
and sweat within a few inches of 
each other. McCullough wondered 
if their club’s rules of behavior, or 
esprit de corps or whatever peculiar 
quality it was that made a group of 
individuals greater than the sum

of its parts, would keep them from 
suiciding out of sheer loneliness or 
tearing each other to pieces from 
utter boredom or disintegrating into 
madness and death for reasons they 
could not as yet even imagine. 

McCullough hoped it would. He 
was almost sure it would. 

II 

T he Prometheus Project was 
either the result of some very 
devious thinking, or there had been 
introduced into it such a multiplicity 
of objectives that its planners did not 
know where they were. 

Even allowing for the hasty 
mounting of the operation — the 
original purpose of the two ships was 
to have been the setting up of a 
manned lab and observatory on 
Deimos — McCullough’s instructions 
were a mish-mash of insufficient data 
and ambiguous language. 

He could follow their reason and 
even feel sympathy for their prob- 
lem. The alien vessel beyond the or- 
bit of Mars was an enigma. To solve 
it they had two small, fragile ships, 
a double payload which was hopeless- 
ly inadequate and six men. If the so- 
lution was to be as complete as pos- 
sible the abilities of the six men 
must cover the widest possible 
spread of physical and social science. 
Since the Ship was obviously the 
product Of a highly advanced culture, 
the knowledge possessed by the six 
men should be complete and exten- 
sive. 

Picking the men — six healthy, 
stably intelligent men capable of 
surviving the.longest journey in hu- 

10 



man history and asking the right 
questions at the end of it — was not 
an easy task, because they had to 
choose men capable of collecting the 
bacon and bringing it home safely. 
Despite the thousands of scientifical- 
ly eminent people who demanded to 
go on the trip, it was the space 
medics who had, as usual, the final 
say. 

Instead of six of the world’s ac- 
knowledged scientific geniuses there 
had been chosen four experienced 
astronauts and two under training 
who were not even known in sci- 
entific circles and were respected only 
by friends. All that could be said 
for them was that they had a fairly 
good chance of surviving the trip. 

McCullough, according to Berry- 
man, had a subconscious which was 
dizzy from watching people go 
around in centrifuges; while Hollis, 
the supercargo in Morrison’s ship, 
was a physicist working on the de- 
velopment of nuclear power plants 
for space vessels. All four of the 
astronauts had in their individual 
fashions told Hollis and McCullough 
that they approved of the choice 
which had been made — even though 
they may have been lying diplo- 
matically — and that the two scienti- 
fic unknowns should not worry about 
the things certain green-complexion- 
ed, ivory-tower types were saying 
about them. When they returned 
home they would all be as famous as 
anyone could hope to be. 

Berryman cleared his throat loud- 
ly, bringing McCullough’s mind back 
to present time with a rush as he 
said, “I suggest we do as the man 
said. Doctor. It’s been thirty-one 



IF 




hours since we slept. Besides, it will 
still be there when you wake up.” 
“What will?” asked Walters. 
“Nothing,” said Berryman. “Mil- 
lions of miles of nothing.” 

“I fell for that one,” said Walters. 
He sighed and with great delibera- 
tion closed his eyes. 

When they were quiet again, wait- 
ing for the sedatives to work, Mc- 
Cullough’s mind returned to the al- 
most laughable problem of these 
people who insisted, quite wrongly, 
that they were his charges. He liked 
to think that his professional quali- 
fications were necessary to the suc- 
cess of this trip, that he would spend 
his time making detailed observations 
and evaluating data gathered on ex- 
tra-terrestrial physiology, sociology 
and even psychology although he was 
not himself a psychologist. But apart 
from five names, faces, tones of voice 
and military insignia, McCullough 
knew very little about his colleagues 
and self-elected patients. 

B asically they were well adjusted 
introverts. An astronaut had no 
business being anything else. Both 
Captain Berryman and Major Wal- 
ters had shown great thoughtfulness 
and consideration in their dealings 
with him. 

Where Colonel Morrison was con- 
cerned he had less to go on. The 
colonel was polite but reserved, and 
there had been very little prior social 
contact between them. The same ap- 
plied to Major Drew. The third mem- 
ber of Morrison’s crew was the 
physicist. Captain Hollis. His rank, 
like that, of McCullough’s, did not 
mean very much and had probably 



been given in order to simplify Army 
paperwork and make it easier for 
them to 'be ordered to do things. 
Hollis did not talk much and when 
he did it was in shy, low-voiced 
polysyllables. Apparently he got his 
kicks from playing chess and fixing 
his friends’ TV sets. 

Then there was Lieutenant-Colonel 
McCullough, of course, a complex 
personality whose motivations Mc- 
Cullough had thought he understood 
until he found himself volunteering 
for this job. He had been under- 
going training for MOL service, the 
idea being to have him share one of 
the orbiting laboratories with a num- 
ber of lab animals and make a study 
of life processes in the weightless 
condition. Like the others he was un- 
married. And this was probably a 
good thing, despite the generally held 
belief that marriage gave added 
strength and emotional stability to an 
astronaut, because Prometheus might 
very well become a suicide mission. 

McCullough wriggled on his couch 
even though all positions were equal- 
ly comfortable in the weightless con- 
dition. Beyond the port Earth was in 
darkness, with the Moon just about 
to slip over the sharply curved hori- 
zon. Cloud masses and continental 
outlines were gray and indistinct, 
with the stars above the horizon 
and the cities below it shining with 
the same intensity, so that the whole 
planet seemed transparent and in- 
substantial, like a world of ecto- 
plasm. 

It was as if the final war had 
started and finished while he wasn’t 
looking and the whole world had 
died, McCullough thought rather 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



11 




iancifully as he slipped over the edge 
of sle^, and a planet-«ized ghost 
pursoed its orbit around the Sun «... 

But when he awakened some hours 
later the Earth was again solid and 
condensed into a bright sphere which 
was just small enough to fit within 
the rim of the pK)rt. 

Berryman and Walters were al- 
ready awake. When they saw that 
McCullough had joined them the 
command pilot passed out breakfast. 
They were squeezing the last of it 
from their tubes when there was an 
interruption. 

*'This is Prometheus Control, 
Good morningy gentlemen! tf you 
have nothing better to do, and we 
are sure you haven^t, we would like 
you to take your first lecture. We 
have now decided to increase the 
frequency of these lectures from 
two to three per day. The first one, 
which should prove very helpful 
when you reach the Ship, deals with 
multi-dimensional geometry,** 

“Ugh,” said Berryman. 

“Drop dead,” said Walters. 

“No comment,” said McCullough. 
*Thank you for your cooperation, 
gentlemen. If you will have pencils 
and paper ready — ” 

**Negative, negative!** the voice of 
Colonel Morrison broke in. **F-One 
to Prometheus Control and P-Two, 
I advise against taking written notes. 
Paper is limited and may be needed 
for purposes of communications and 
supplementary sketches for the pho- 
tographs taken at the Ship.** 

*'A good point, Colonel. Very well, 
mental notes only until a decision 
has been taken in this matter. And 
now, if you*re ready to begin 



T here was a short silence broken 
by two bursts of static and an 
apologetic cough. Then a new voice 
said: 

*'Well, now. The subject of this 
lecture may itself need an explana- 
tion, and it is this: from our ob- 
servations of the approach, physical 
mass and general appearance of the 
alien ship, we are convinced that 
some method of faster-than-light 
propulsion is being used. Since Ein- 
steinian math holds FTL travel to 
be impossible in this spacetime con- 
tinuum we must fall back on those 
vaguer theories which suggest that 
the physical laws governing this con- 
tinuum may be in some fashion side- 
stepped by travelling along or within 
some highly speculative hyperdimen- 
sion, But as things stand you would 
very probably not know a hyperdi- 
mensional propulsion device if it 
stood up and bit you. And neither in 
all probability would I,** 

There was a small, dry, academic 
cough. Then the voice went on. 

“5o the purpose of this lecture is, 
by outlining current thinking on this 
subject together with our specula- 
tions and supporting math, to give 
you a slightly better chance of recog- 
nizing a hyperdimensional generator 
if you should happen to see one, 
^'Subsequent lectures on a wide 
range of subjects are expected to in- 
clude ,,,,** 

McCullough was beginning to feel 
concern for a future which now 
promised to be positively rather than 
negatively boring. He hoped the 
Prometheus people knew what they 
were doing and had taken pains to 
pick the right kind of lecturer. When 



12 



IF 




thb idea had been first mentioned 
they had agreed that without visual 
aids or textbooks the process of learn- 
ing new and difficult subjects would 
be anything but easy. If handled prop- 
erly, the lectures would help negate 
boredom by engendering a competi- 
tive spirit among the two ships’ 
crews. This would be a very good 
thing — provided it did not cause 
some people to appear less bright 
than their fellows, a situation which 
could open the way to all sorts of 
conflicts and emotional disturbances. 
But all this had been taken into con- 
sideration, the Prometheus astronauts 
had been told, and any harmful side 
effects would be guarded against. 

Probably time alone would tell, 
McCullough thought. At least this 
lecturer possessed a rudimentary sense 
of humor. 

He was saying, "*To give you an 
example, our knowledge of extra-ter- 
restrial biology, physiology and so- 
ciology is nil. But in future lectures 
we will prepare you to a certain ex- 
tent for whatever you may meet by 
considering in detail the sexual mores 
of certain isolated cultures on our 
own planet and the exotic reproduc- 
tive mechanisms of our more alien 
terrestrial animals, insects and plants, 
and by formulating the type of social 
system these creatures might be ex- 
pected to develop were they to rise 
to a human level of intelligence. 

**All this is simply an indication 
of what you may expect from the 
various specialist lecturers who will 
follow me. 

**Before I commence my series of 
lectures it might be better if I intro- 
duced myself. I am Doctor — of 



Philosophy, not Medicine — Edward' 
Ernest Pugh, Professor of Mathema- 
tics at the University of Coleraine 
and Director of its Department of 
Extra-Mural Studies.'* 

Berryman turned to stare very 
solemnly out of the Earth-side port. 
He said, “Just how extra-mural can 
a student get?” 

Walters and McCullough laughed, 
and Professor Pugh- asked them to 
begin by considering a tesseract. 

Ill 

ime passed. 

Their education grew while 
Earth and the apparent size of their 
vehicle shrank. When the bulkheads 
pressed in on them too closely they 
took turns going outside, treating in- 
cipient claustrophobia with threaten- 
ed agoraphobia. At least that was how 
Berryman described the process. But 
he talked that way, as they all did, to 
hide his real feelings. The simple truth 
was that on the end of a long safety 
line, with their vehicle looking like 
some surrealistic toy five hundred 
yards away, the whole of Creation 
was spread out around them in sharp 
focus and perfect 3-D, and it was not 
a sight which could be ea^ly talked 
about. 

With the increased distance from 
Earth and Prometheus Control, com- 
munications difficulties also grew. 
Not only did periodic solar interfer- 
ence make incoming messages bare- 
ly intelligible, the time-lag between 
outgoing questions and incoming 
answers was more than eight minutes. 
When it became necessary to turn 
up the gain on theijr receiver because 




ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



13 




a whisper of intelligence was trying 
to fight its way through a thunder 
of mush, the time-lag was more than 
simply irritating. Finally even the 
colonel could stand it no longer. 

**You may be transmitting a lecture 
on production methods in the aircraft 
industry,** Morrison enunciated slow- 
ly and with sarcasm, "*but it sounds 
like a tape of Omaha Beach on D- 
Day. You are fighting a losing bat- 
tle. Give up until these blasted sun- 
spots have gone back to sleep, at 
least!** 

Eight minutes later a tiny voice 
fought its way through a barrage of 
static to say, . Your message in- 
completely received ... do not have 
battle tactics . Operation Overload 
immediately available . loss to un- 
derstand this request ....** 

**You misunderstood my message, 
Prometheus Control,** the colonel’s 
voice returned, louder but with less 
clarity of diction. '7 requested that 
you cease transmission ,...** 

A lecture scheduled on 
Games Theory, but must warn you 
. Alien conception of military tac- 
tics may not agree . Eisen- 
hower ....** 

**Don*t talk when Vm interrupting, 
dammit!** 

For perhaps five minutes Control 
battled against the static with a com- 
plete lack of success, then the colo- 
nel’s voice came again. 

*‘P-One to P-Two. You may break 
contact with Control without their 
permission. I take full responsibility.** 

For a long time they simply 
luxuriated in the peace and quiet, 
then Walters said angrily, “You know, 
that noise was bad. You, sir, were 



practically tying yourself in knots and 
the doctor had his eyes squeezed shut 
and all his teeth showing. This is not 
good. Noise, any loud or unnecessary 
or unpleasant noise, especially in a 
confined space like this, makes me 
irritable. I’m beginning to dread these 
lectures three times a day. Somebody 
should do something about them. 
Somebody with authority!” 

“I agree,” said McCullough. 

“Of course you agree!” Walters’s 
voice was high-pitched, almost shrew- 
ish. “You always agree, but that’s 
all you do!” 

“I think Morrison intends doing 
something,” Berryman said quickly. 
He looked worriedly from Walters to 
McCullough and back, then went on. 
“And the doctor is a rather agree- 
able man, if a little hard to pin 
down at times. Myself, I expected 
him to look clinical occasionally and 
perhaps talk a bit dirty. At very least 
he should have spent a few days 
mentally dissecting us, explaining the 
real truth about our relationship with 
our first teddy bear and generally 
showing us what monstrous perverts 
we are under our warm, friendly ex- 
teriors. But he doesn’t talk like a 
psychologist, or look like one or even 
admit to being one.” 

Berryman was trying hard to 
smooth things down. And he was 
succeeding, but with his eyes he was 
asking the doctor for a little help. 

“Well, now,” said McCullough 
gravely, “you must understand first- 
ly that, if anything, I would be an 
Eysenckian rather than a Freudian 
psychologist and so would never have 
had an occasion to use a couch pro- 
fessionally. But there was one period 



14 



IF 




when I did some valuable research, if 
I do say so myself, on the behavior 
and psychology of worms. 

“There were some quite intriguing 
incidents,” McCullough went on. 
‘They had numbers instead of names, 
so there is no question of an unethi- 
cal disclosure of privileged informa- 
tion, and they had such a low order 
of intelligence that to get through 
to them at all we had to stimulate the 
clitellum with a mild electric . 
Berryman shook his head. 

“Well, I did try,” said McCul- 
lough, projecting a hurt expression. 
He went on, “As for making noises 
like a psychologist and pushing your 
mental buttons, this would be a waste 
of time. You are both well adjusted, 
self-aware, intellectually and emotion- 
ally honest and already well versed 
in the terminology, so that any prob- 
lem which arises is immediately recog- 
nized, classified and dealt with by the 
person concerned. So there isn’t any- 
thing for me to do even if I was 
supposed to do it.” 

For perhaps a minute there was 
silence, then Walters said, “I’m sorry 
I blew up at you. Doctor. If I’d been 
using my head at all I should have 
realized that anyone who turns nasty 
with a psychologist ends up being 
flattered to death.” 

“My point exactly!” said McCul- 
lough to Berryman. “He can even see 
through my subtle attempts at mani- 
pulation by flattery!” 

Berryman nodded and said, “Now 
if only the aliens on the Ship are 
worms . .” 

B ut on a wider, more objective level 
the situation was definitely not 



normal. The space inside P-Two not 
taken up with control, communica- 
tions and life-support systems, left 
very little room for either movement 
or privacy. Their total living space 
was a hollow cylinder seven feet in 
diameter and four deep, and this was 
further reduced by couches, control 
consoles and instrumentation which 
projected into it. Nobody could move 
more than a few inches without stick- 
ing an elbow or a knee in someone’s 
face or stomach. Even the sanitary ar- 
rangements gave visual privacy only. 
And because their tanked oxygen was 
restricted, trips outside the ship were 
kept down to a total of two hours per 
week, and they just could not be alone 
for the length of time required by 
normal introverts. Instead they lay 
strapped loosely into their couches, 
exercising for an hour or so each 
day by pitting one muscle against an- 
other, taking or not talking, listening 
to incoming signals and smelling to 
high heaven. 

In living quarters which compared 
unfavorably with the most unenlight- 
ened penal institutions, the crew of 
P-Two — and P-One, presumably — 
shared a not always peaceful co-exis- 
tence. They tried to be polite and 
considerate to each other, but not too 
much so. The efforts of guarding 
one’s tongue continually, of always 
being polite, would have been so 
much of a strain that the emotional 
backlash would have led inevitably to 
violence. 

Instead they were normally bad- 
tempered or sarcastic, while remaining 
at all times sensitive to potentially 
dangerous changes of atmosphere. If 
they sensed that the subject of their 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



15 




displeasure or sarcasm was becoming 
too strongly affected by it, the re- 
marks were allowed to grow to ridicu- 
lous and laughable proportions. They 
became adept at walking this psy- 
chological tightrope. But they were 
subject to severe external pressures as 
well. 

Earth had decided to investigate the 
Ship with a group of trained astro- 
nauts rather than a cross section of 
the best scientific brains, and all 
things considered it had been a sound 
decision. But Earth desperately want- 
ed things to go right at the Ship. They 
wanted a smooth social and cultural 
contact, and they badly wanted to find 
out everything they possibly could 
about alien science and technology. 
As a result, they were trying to cover 
themselves both ways by doing every- 
thing possible to make scientific in- 
vestigators out of their astronauts. 

The low signal to noise ratio dur- 
ing some of the lectures was merely 
an added irritant. The real trouble 
was that the lectures themselves were 
a constant reminder to every one of 
them of what lay at the end of the 
trip. 

Any well adjusted person could 
face up to a problem once it was de- 
fined. But when nothing at all was 
known about it other than that it was 
in the life-and-death category and 
that it must somehow be solved, even 
the sanest personality could show 
signs of strain. j 

They were now three weeks away 
in time from the alien ship .... 

After one lecture so speculative 
that it was almost pure science fic- 
tion, Walters said, “It would be nice 
if we could simply hold our hands 



out in the universal gesture of peace. 
But what is the universal gesture of 
peace to an octopus or an intelligent 
vegetable?” 

McCullough said, “We don’t usual- 
ly make gestures of peace at animals 
or vegetables, so their gestures 
towards us are either defensive or 
hostile. Tortoises retreat under their 
shells, octopuses squirt ink at us and 
plants grow thorns if they are able. 
Offhand I’d say that if an animal or 
being behaves normally when it is 
approached by a stranger — that is, if 
it doesn’t take any offensive or defen- 
sive action — then it is either peace- 
fully inclined or suffering from an 
impairment of sensory equipment or 
brainpower. But this is an unsatisfac- 
tory answer, since it may involve a 
being whose normal reactions will be 
just as strange to us as its abnormal 
ones. I don’t know.” 

“Let us suppose,” Berryman said, 
“that the Ship is solidly packed with 
a vitamin-enriched sandy substance — 
except for certain hollowed-out areas 
for power and control systems — with 
provision made for renewing the food 
element and eliminating wastes. 
Furniture, bedding and so on would 
be virtually non-existent and control 
levers and . and push pads, they 
would have to be, rather than push- 
buttons . would be positioned all 
the way around and perhaps inside 
the mechanism they were designed 
to control. This being would curl it- 
self around and insinuate itself into 
the machine it was operating . .” 

“Not worms again!” said Walters. 

“I’m talking about an intelligent, 
wormlike life-form,” the command 
pilot went on. “A worm who stayed 



16 



IF 




out of its burrow long enough to 
look up and wonder at the stars.” 

“Oh, very poetic,” said Walters. 

“Shaddup, you. A worm who de- 
veloped intelligence and the degree 
of cooperation which made possible 
civilization and technological prog- 
ress. And now, Doctor, suppose you 
were confronted by a member of 
such a species. With your specialist 
knowledge of the physiology and mo- 
tivations of what amounts to the ab- 
original ancestors of these beings, 
could you arrive at an understanding 
with them?” 

McCullough thought for a moment, 
then said, “An analogy would be that 
of an alien being able to understand 
a human being from data gained 
while examining a baboon. I don’t 
think it is possible. In any case the 
intellectual and evolutionary gap be- 
tween your star-travelling worms and 
mine is much greater than that be- 
tween a man and a baboon. This 
is why we are being subjected to 
these lectures on the mating habits 
of armadillos and things.” 

“Things, he says.” Berryman made 
a face and began passing out lunch. 

They nearly always ate after a dis- 
cussion about the beings on the Ship, 
but Berryman and Walters had 
stopped mentioning the psychological 
connection between feelings of inse- 
curity and eating. The only person to 
speak at all during the meal was 
Walters. “You know. Doctor, there 
must be something you can dp!” 

T hree days later something came 
up which the doctor could do. 
Something, apparently, which only 
the doctor could do. 



^'Morrison here. Put the doctor on, 
please** 

“Yes, sir,” said McCullough. 
**Captain Hollis is having trouble. 
A ... a skin condition, among other 
things. He yvon*t sleep without hec^vy 
sedation and we*re running out of 
that. I realize it is a lot to ask, but 
Vd prefer you to see him rather" than 
prescribe from where you are. Can 
you come over to P-One, Doctor?** 
Instinctively McCullough looked 
out at the stars. He could not see 
P-One because it was visible only 
on the radar screen. The last time 
anyone had seen it was when they 
were being inserted into orbit above 

Earth. He cleared his throat and 

said, “Yes, of course.” 

**At this distance there is an ele- 

ment of risk involved.** 

“I realize that.” 

**Very well. Thank you.** 

When the colonel had signed off 
Walters gave McCullough a long, 
steady look, then held up three fin- 
gers. He said, “One, you’re stupid. 
Two, you’re brave. Or three, you’ve 
been brainwashed.” 

IV 

T he personnel launcher was a light- 
alloy rigid pipe fifty feet long, 
built up in sections and slotted to- 
gether without projections of any 
kind. It was assembled forward so as 
to form a continuation of the center 
line of the ship, and the charge which 
tossed its human missile into space 
was matched by an equal thrust 
directed aft so as to avoid the neces- 
sity of course corrections. On this oc- 
casion the whole ship had to be aimed 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



17 




at the target on a radar bearing rather 
than a visual sighting. 

Berryman threaded the launching 
harness onto the first section of pipe 
and, while Walters completed the 
erection, the command pilot harnessed 
McCullough to the stupid contraption. 
It was a little odd that McCullough 
regarded it as a contraption now, 
when on Earth, after studying draw- 
ings and operating principles and 
seeing the demonstration films, he had 
considered it an ingenious and fool- 
proof device. 

The harness itself was a somewhat 
lopsided fabrication of thin metal 
tubing built around the hollow cylin- 
der which fitted over the launching 
pipe, with the bulky oxygen and re- 
action^ tanks grouped on one side and 
the b^y webbing on the other. But 
when a man was attached to the 
harness and his arms drawn back and 
joined behind him and his legs bent 
vertically at the knees — there were 
special cuffs and stirrups fitted so 
that this could be done comfortably 
— the device began to assume a de- 
gree of symmetry. With the man add- 
ed, the center of thrust roughly coin- 
cided with the center of gravity, so 
that the system had only a slight 
tendency to spin after launching. 

“The push will send you off at 
just under fifteen miles per hour,” 
Berryman told him for the third or 
fourth time, “so if our shooting is 
very good and you hit P-One at this 
speed it would be like running into a 
brick wall. You would hurt yourself, 
you might damage or rupture your 
suit and the impact could wreck the 
other ship.” 

**Don*t joke about things like that. 



Berryman! Besides, youHl make him 
nervous” 

“I wasn’t joking, Colonel,” the 
command pilot replied. Then to Mc- 
Cullough he went on, “I was trying 
to make you cautious rather than ner- 
vous, Doctor. Just remember to check 
your velocity with respect to the other 
ship in plenty of time. Start decelerat- 
ing when you are about a mile off, 
come to a stop not too close, then 
edge in on your gas motor. You have 
a good reserve of reaction mass, your 
air will last for six hours and the trip 
will take roughly three and a half 
hours since P-One is over fifty miles 
away.” 

“Suppose it isn’t there after three 
and a half hours,” said McCullough. 
“It’s a very small ship and . .” 

“Such morbid imaginings,” said 
Walters severely, “ill behoove a psy- 
chological gentleman.” 

“You’re ready to go, Doctor,” said 
Berryman. “Give me ten minutes to 
get inside and check the radar bear- 
ing again. Walters, keep clear of the 
launcher.” 

The launch itself was an anticlimax, 
just a comfortable, solid push that re- 
minded McCullough of the first few 
seconds in an express elevator. Then 
he cleared the guide tube and was 
tumbling very slowly end over end. 

Quickly he withdrew his arms and 
legs from their retaining clips and, 
when P-Two came into sight again, 
spread them out to check his spin. 
Walters and Berryman did not talk, 
although he could hear the sound of 
their breathing in his phones, and Mc- 
Cullough kept silent as well. The ship 
dwindled in size very slowly — it did 
not appear to move away from him.

IF 




just to grow smaller — so that the 
launcher was dismantled and the tiny 
figures of the two pilots had re-en- 
tered the lock before distance made 
the finer details of the vehicle run 
together into a silvery triangular blur. 

Just before it disappeared com- 
pletely McCullough rotated himself 
until he was facing his direction of 
travel and began searching for an 
identical blur which would be Morri- 
son’s ship, even though the soonest 
he could hope to see it would be in 
another two hours. 

The colonel had suggested that he 
sleep on the way over, leaving his 
receiver switched on at full volume 
so that Morrison could wake him 
when it became necessary. McCul- 
lough had refused this suggestion for 
two reasons. The one he gave the 
colonel was that he did not want to 
be half asleep when he closed with 
P-One — making contact might be 
a tricky enough job with him wide 
awake.. The other reason he did not 
tell anyone. It was his fear of wak- 
ing up with no ship in sight, beyond 
all help or hope of help, alone .... 

He was very much aware of the 
safety line coiled neatly at his waist, 
and of the fact that the other end 
of it was not attached to anything. 

But that was just the beginning .... 

I n the weightless condition no 
muscular effort was required to 
keep arrhs and legs outstretched, and 
in that attitude spin was reduced to 
a minimum. But gradually the po- 
sition began to feel awkward and 
ridiculous and, in some obscure fash- 
ion, unprotected. All around him the 
stars hung bright and close and beau- 



tiful, but the blackness between them 
went on and on forever. He told him- 
self truthfully that he enjoyed being 
out here, that there was nothing to 
threaten him, nothing to be immedi- 
ately afraid of and nobody to even 
see his fear if he should show it. 

He was all alone. 

His rate of spin began to increase 
slowly, then rapidly as his outstretch- 
ed arms and legs contracted until his 
knees were drawn up against his 
stomach and his arms, with the el- 
bows tucked in as far as his suit would 
allow, folded tightly across his chest. 
But it was not until he realized that 
his eyes were squeezed shut that Mc- 
Cullough began to wonder what ex- 
actly it was that was happening to 
him. 

He badly needed to straighten him- 
self out, in both senses of the word. 

But for some odd reason his body 
had passed beyond the control of his 
mind, just as the various layers of his 
mind were no longer under the con- 
trol of his will. He was feeling rather 
than thinking. It was as if he was an 
enormous, dry sponge soaking up, be- 
ing saturated in, loneliness. The pure- 
ly subjective loneliness of being un- 
known and unnoticed in a crowd, the 
actual loneliness of being on a de- 
serted beach where the uncaring 
natural phenomena of wind and wave 
press all around and the awful, lost 
feeling of the child in the night who 
believes, whether rightly or wrongly, 
that he is unwanted and unloved. The 
feeling which was welling up inside 
McCullough was loneliness distilled, 
concentrated and ultimately refined. 
Anything in his previous experience 
was like comparing a slight over-ex- 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



19 




posure to the sun with third degree 
bums. 

He crouched into himself even 
more tightly while the unseen stars 
whirled around him and the hot 
tears forced their way between his 
squeezed-together lids. 

Then the awful feeling of loneliness 
began to withdraw, or perhaps he 
was withdrawing from it. The weight- 
less spinning was oddly pleasant. 
There was a timeless, hypnotic quality 
about it. The sensation was like the 
moment after a tumble into deep 
water when it is impossible to tell if 
one is upside down or not, and yet 
the warm salt water is supporting and 
protecting and pressing close .... 

"'Say somethingl” shouted Mc- 
Cullough. 

“Something,” said Berryman 
promptly. 

** Anything wrong. Doctor?'* 

“Not . not really, sir,” said Mc- 
Cullough. “Whatever it was . I’m 
all right now.” 

""Good! I thought you were sleep- 
ing after all — you haven't made a 
sound for over two hours. We should 
be just about visible to you now." 

McCullough straightened and slow- 
ed his spin. The stars rose majestical- 
ly above the upper rim of his visor, 
reached zenith and then slowly set 
between his feet. When the sun came 
around he covered it with his hand 
so as not to be blinded, and he search- 
ed the sky. But the two bright ob- 
jects he picked out were too brilliant 
to be P-One — they were probably 
Sirius and Jupiter, but he was so dis- 
oriented that he could not really be 
very sure. 

“I can’t find you.” 



T here must have been an edge of 
panic in his tone because Morri- 
son said quickly, **You*re doing fine. 
Doctor. Our radar shows a solid trace 
for P-Two, If you were off course 
to any large extent there would be 
two traces, so any divergence is mi- 
nor, Look around you carefully." 

Perhaps ten minutes went by, then 
Morrison said, ""When you were 
launched, our position with respect to 
your ship was approximately ten de- 
grees below and fifteen degrees to 
the right of the central star in the 
right half of the W in Cassiopeia, or 
above and to the left of the left center 
star if you're turned around and it 
looks like an M, Use Cassiopeia as 
your center and search outwards into 
Perseus, Andromeda and Cepheus — 
do you get the idea? The closer you 
are to us the greater will be our ap- 
parent displacement, 

**We should be the brightest object 
in sight by now. You should begin 
deceleration in seven and one half 
minutes . .” 

And if he did not decelerate Mc- 
Cullough would go past P-One, pos- 
sibly without even seeing it. But if 
he decelerated without seeing it and 
directing his thrust in the right sec- 
tion of sky the chances were that 
he would go off at a tangent or shoot 
past the ship at double his present 
velocity. If that happened he doubted 
very much whether his air or his re- 
action mass would be sufficient for 
him to find his way back. 

McCullough tried not to pursue 
that line of thought. He tried so 
hard that before he realized it his 
knees were drawn up and his arms 
pressed tightly against his chest again, 

ib; 



20 




and the stars were swirling around 
him like a jeweled blizzard. He swore 
suddenly and starfished again, forc- 
ing his mind to concentrate on the 
slowly wheeling heavens so that he 
could impose some sort of order on 
what had become a mass of tiny, uni- 
dentifiable lights. He viewed them 
with his head straight and tilted to 
each side, or he tried to imagine them 
upside down, and gradually he was 
able to see them with the imaginary 
lines connecting one to the other 
which gave them the shapes of Hunt- 
ers and Archers and Crabs. He re- 
alized suddenly that as well as spin- 
ning head over heels he had also been 
turning sideways, and he was able to 
identify Capella, which was hanging 
out beyond his left hip. 

Capella had picked up a very 
strange companion. 

As quickly as possible McCul- 
lough lined himself up on the object, 
placed hands and feet into the cuffs 
and stirrups, then said, “I have you. 
Standing by to decelerate.” 

‘7/1 eight seconds, Doctor, And I 
must say you cut it close .... Now!** 

A little later Morrison said, *We 
can see your gas discharge. Doctor. 
Very nice shooting, P-Two.** 

From the other ship there came 
sounds of Berryman and Walters be- 
ing modest. McCullough’s pre-calcu- 
lated period of deceleration ceased, 
leaving him barely three hundred 
yards from the other ship, where two 
tiny figures were already crawling 
out of the airlock and onto the hull. 
He aimed himself carefully and jetted 
slowly towards them. 

Morrison said, **As you know. Doc- 
tor, there is no privacy and very little 



space for a physical examination in 
the control module, so Drew and my- 
self will erect the launcher for your 
return while you have a look at Cap- 
tain Hollis. Take your time — with- 
in reason, of course — and signal 
with the airlock lamp when you*ve 
finished. You may not want us to be 
listening with our suit radios** 

There was little conversation after 
that until McCullough made contact 
with the hull and negotiated the air- 
lock. He found himself in a control 
module which was in every respect 
identical tb the one on the other ship. 
It even smelled as bad, and differed 
only in the figure occupying the su- 
pernumary’s position. 

McCullough gave Hollis a long, 
sympathetic, clinical look and then 
sighed. Unoriginally he said, “What 
seems to be the trouble?” 

V 

I t was a simple question but Mc- 
Cullough knew the answer would 
be a complicated one. Hollis was a 
distressed and deeply troubled man. 

There was, of course, no provision 
for taking baths on the Prometheus 
expedition, but the crews had periodic 
alcohol rubdowns to unclog their 
pores, the alcohol being filtered out 
and reclaimed by the air circulation 
system. While their meals lacked bulk 
they contained all the necessary 
vitamins. Even so, as McCullough 
peeled the one piece coverall from 
Hollis’ shoulders and arms he could 
not help thinking about ancient sail- 
ing ships with water going green in 
their casks and the crews down with 
scurvy or worse. 



22 



' IF 




A large area of the physicist’s body 
had obviously not known the alcohol 
pad for months. The skin was clogged 
and dry and scaling, and his arms, 
chest and shoulders were covered with 
raw patches and sores, the condition 
extending up to his face and neck. 
Despite having no fingernails to 
speak of it was plain that Hollis had 
been continually picking or rubbing 
at them through his coveralls until 
his body must have become one great, 
livid itch. 

“Can you remember when this 
trouble started?” McCullough asked 
quietly, trying to ignore the pricklings 
of the sympathetic itch that was 
creeping over his own body. 

“About . about nine weeks out,” 
Hollis answered. His eyes would not 
meet McCullough’s and his hands 
twitched and crawled all over his 
body. He went on, “I suppose it 
started about two weeks after Drew 
let slip . , . After I found out what 
they were doing. But I can’t tell you 
about that.” 

“Why not?” said McCullough, 
smiling. “I don’t shock very easily, 
you know.” 

Hollis looked startled and for a mo- 
ment he almost laughed. Then he said 
quickly, apologetically, “I’m sorry, I 
gave you the wrong impression. It 
isn’t shocking like that. They . 
they have a secret. They do have a 
secret! Of course they don’t know 
I know about it. Walters and Berry- 
man aren’t in on it, either. Or you. 
But it’s bad. You’ve no idea how bad. 
But I’m sorry — I can’t tell you 
about it, I don’t know how you’d 
react. You might let something slip 
to Morrison. Or you might blow the 



whole thing wide open and be a party 
to ... I suppose it would be mutiny. 
I’m sorry, it wouldn’t be fair to bur- 
den you with this thing. I ... I 
don’t want to talk about it.” 

But it was quite obvious that he 
did want to talk about it, desperately, 
and that McCullough would have 
very little coaxing to do to have this 
deep, dark, desperate secret revealed 
to him in its entirety. He said, still 
smiling, “I expect you know best. 
But it would have been nice to take 
back a juicy piece of gossip to the 
other ship . .” 

“This is serious, damn you!” 
“Very well,” McCullough said, less 
pleasantly. “Your present condition 
is something we will have to talk 
about. And because I prefer the talk 
to be private, and Morrison and Drew 
have a limited supply of air out there, 
we will have to cut a few corners. 

“Since everyone on this expedition 
seems to be very well informed on the 
subjects of psychiatry and psycho- 
logy,” he went on, smiling again, 
“I’ll assume that you have a fair 
understanding of the operation of the 
subconscious mind. You will be aware 
of the perfectly normal pressures, con- 
flicts of personality and basic insecuri- 
ties to which all of us are subject, 
also of the fact that these are serious- 
ly aggravated by our present environ- 
ment. This being so, you must re- 
alize that your physical trouble, this 
unsightly and uncomfortable skin con- 
dition, has a purely psychological 
basis. There are no germs, no vitamin 
deficiencies, nothing to which you 
would be allergic on the ship.” 

If Berryman and Walters could 
hear me now, McCullough thought

briefly. The trouble was it was so easy 
to talk like a psychologist. 

He went on, “Well now, I realize 
that being separated from the rest 
of humanity by fifty million miles is 
bad enough. But if you have been 
rejected, or feel that you have been 
rejected by the other men in the 
ship, that could be the initial cause 
of your trouble. Your evident anxiety 
over this secret you have uncovered 
will not have helped matters.” 

McCullough had an almost over- 
whelming urge to scratch his left 
armpit through his spacesuit, and 
another sympathetic itch raged behind 
his right knee. He continued, “A re- 
jected person tends to become self- 
conscious and much more aware of 
himself both physically and mental- 
ly. Your body becomes much more 
sensitive, even hypersensitive, to 
stimuli which are normally ignored. 
Your trouble probably began with 
an itchy scalp or earlobe which you 
scratched almost without thinking. 
But gradually, though constant repeti- 
tion and irritation, the psychosomatic 
itch became a real one. 

“This is an extreme over-simplifi- 
cation, of course,” McCullough said. 
“Doubtless there were many other 
factors which contributed to your 
present sorry state. But right now 
we should do something positive about 
alleviating your present condition — 
with something more than lanolin 
since that would relieve only the 
physical symptoms. Also, since the 
axiom that a trouble shared is a trou- 
ble halved is so old that and true 
that it was used before psychology 
was invented, I would like to know 
what the other two are keeping secret 

24 



which distresses you so much. I’ll be 
discreet, of course . .” 

He let the sentence hang, but ob- 
viously Hollis needed more coaxing. 
McCullough tried a different tack. 
He said, “What is Morrison like as 
a person? And Drew? How have their 
relations towards you changed since 
the beginning of the trip? Be as ob- 
jective as you can.” 

A person could say an awful lot 
about themselves by the way they 
talked about someone else. 

A s he began to talk Hollis may 
have thought that he was being 
objective, and McCullough, too, lost 
quite a lot of his objectivity as he 
listened. He began to feel angry with 
Morrison and Drew, particularly with 
the colonel. For despite this phe- 
nomenal brain Hollis had always been 
the shy, timid, eager-to-please type, 
and the necessary allowances should 
have been made. As his relations with 
the other two had steadily worsened, 
and in an attempt to get on better 
terms with them again, his timidity 
had increased to ridiculous and quite 
irritating proportions for a grown 
man. He had abased himself and 
fawned and generally carried on like 
a frightened dog. 

This was not the way Hollis told 
it, of course. McCullough was read- 
ing between the lines. 

It had started because the colonel 
and Drew knew each other long be- 
fore either of them were connected 
with astronautics. They had served 
together briefly in southeast Asia and 
Drew had done Morrison some sort 
of favor. Hollis had been unable to 
ascertain whether the favor had been 

IP 




sordid or sublime, whether it involved 
white slavery, the black market of 
just saving the colonel’s life. 

As the weeks went past the two 
had talked together more and more 
often about their small war, men- 
tioning people and places and making 
stupid, in-group jokes. Hollis was ex- 
cluded to an increasing extent from 
these conversations and when, out of 
sheer desperation, he tried to join in, 
he usually made a mess of it and 
stopped the conversation stone dead. 

Listening to the physicist, McCul- 
lough could not help thinking of his 
own ship. He hesitated to make com- 
parisons with the two comedian- 
psychologists on P-Two and the 
sometimes artificial atmosphere of 
good cheer they generated, but if 
Morrison and Drew had made a sim- 
ilar effort Hollis would probably 
not be in his present condition. From 
his knowledge of Hollis during 
training he thought the physicist, 
once he got over his initial shy- 
ness and timidity, would have been 
a very pleasant and stimulating per- 
son to have on a long voyage. 

Instead they had talked about 
their jungle air-war as if it had been 
some kind of exclusive holiday in a 
language which excluded Hollis. 
Then they had gone on to talk about 
another matter — again in the 
cryptic, slangy manner the physicist 
was not supposed to understand. 
But Hollis had been able to under- 
stand. A little at first, then later 
he had been able to piece together 
the whole frightful operation. He 
freely admitted to McQillough that 
he was uneducated where such 
things as women and power politics 



were concerned, because so much 
of his life had been spent in col- 
lecting degrees, but this did not 
mean that he was stupid. 

“This was when you became rest- 
less and itchy, I take it,” McCul- 
lough broke in at that point, “and 
you began to irritate the others. How 
did they react?” 

“The colonel didn’t react at all,” 
said Hollis. “He just looked long- 
suffering and stopped talking to me 
completely. Drew swore at me for a 
time, then he went the same way. 
They started going outside together 
between lectures, connecting their 
air lines to the ship supply so as 
not to waste tanked air. They 
switched off their radios sometimes 
and talked by touching helmets. But 
there was sound conduction along 
the return air line, and sometimes 
I could make out a word here and 
there. Enough to know what was 
going on. 

“Did you know,” Hollis rushed 
on, “that the hold at take-off was 
deliberate? That Morrison has made 
no attempt to close the distance 
between the two ships? Fuel con- 
servation, he says. But your ship is 
expendable, did you know that? 
They’ve discussed all sorts of hypo- 
thetical approaches and tactics to 
use against the alien ship, the desir- 
ability of an armed as opposed to 
an unarmed approach. 

Hollis’s arms were partly folded, 
and he was tearing absentmindedly 
at his forearms with fingernails 
which had been gnawed too short 
to do any real damage. Suddenly 
he stopped scratching, closed his 
eyes tightly and said, “I’m sorry. I

didn’t want to tell you. But you’ve 
a right to know, Doctor. P-One is 
carrying a Dirty Annie!” 

D irty Annie was a nuclear device 
which was a little too destruc- 
tive and long-lasting in its after- 
effects to be called tactical. Mc- 
Cullough was silent for a moment 
as he thought over all the implica- 
tions of what he had heard. Then he 
said, “This is serious.” 

It was dangerously ambiguous, he 
realized as soon as he said it. But 
Hollis had not noticed that. The 
physicist was talking furiously, 
apologizing for sharing his worries 
with the doctor, pleading with him 
not (to tell the colonel and to do 
something about Morrison and 
Drew, simultaneously. McCullough 
listen^ with half his mind while the 
other half cringed with sympathy. 

Not all of the sympathy was for 
Hollis. 

Morrison and Drew could not 
have had a very pleasant time either, 
driven as they had been into long 
periods of unscheduled extra-vehic- 
ular 'activity. They may well have 
been guilty of thoughtlessness in 
their dealings with Hollis, but con- 
stant EVA put a dangerous strain on 
their suits. The P-«hips could not 
afford the weight penalty of carrying 
spare spacesuits, must less atomic 
bombs. 

McCullough wondered suddenly 
what shape his own delusion would 
have taken, what particular night- 
mare his own subconscious would 
have dredged up, if Walters and 
Berryman had rejected him. An 



atomic bomb was perhaps a too- 
simple form for a physicist’s night- 
mare to take, but then at heart 
Hollis was a very simple man. 

There still remained the question 
of his treatment. 

Very quietly and seriously Mc- 
Cullough said, “Naturally I shall 
not mention this to the colonel or 
Drew. At the proper time I may 
discuss it with Walters and Berry- 
man — but they won’t talk out of 
turn either. It’s hard to say exactly 
what we must do about it until 
the time comes, but when it does 
remember that we will be four 
agains their two. And remember 
this as well. The problem isn’t yours 
alone any more. Three of your 
friends will be helping you solve 
it. They may even, since they are 
not so close to it as you are and 
may thus be able to consider the 
problem more objectively, solve it 
for you. Think about this, won’t 
you? Think about it really hard.” 

McCullough paused for a mo- 
ment, then went on to say. “You 
have already realized that your con- 
dition is directly attributable to 
worry about this bomb. Anyone with 
an ounce of sensitivity in them 
would have reacted in much the 
same fashion. But there is no ne- 
cessity to worry now — at least 
to the extent where it affects you 
physically. 

“You may be surprised how 
quickly this skin condition clears 
up,” he continued, “and how com- 
fortable you will begin to feel gen- 
erally. The colonel will be sur- 
prised, too, and for that reason I’ll 



26 



IF 




leave a supply of medication to 
heflp the process along. Morrison 
will assume that the salve and tab- 
lets are effecting a cure, but this 
iS' a necessary subterfuge since you 
can’t very well tell him the real 
cause of your improvement — the 
fact that his secret is now common 
property. But in order to further 
allay his suspicions I will have to 
be very tough — or appear to be 
very tough — on you.” 

A yTcCullough was going to be 
iVA very tough with Drew and 
the colonel as well. He was going 
to insist that Morrison pad and 
bandage the patient’s hands so that 
he would be unable to scratch him- 
self until his skin condition had a 
chance to heal, which meant that 
Hollis would have to be fed and 
generally wet-nursed by the other 
two men. Drew would probably 
come in for most of the work, but 
the application of salve and the 
checking of Hollis’s condition — 
McCullough would insist on daily 
progress reports — would be a 
two-man job. In short, Hollis must 
no longer be treated as an outcast, 
and Morrison and Drew would be 
made to realize that psychosomatic 
leprosy was not catching. 

Drew and the colonel might not 
be too gentle in their treatment 
of the patient at first, it would be 
embarrassing for all concerned and 
the atmosphere would be anything 
but warm and friendly. But at least 
they would not be ignoring Hollis, 
and that was an important first step. 
Later, other steps would suggest 
themselves. 



McCullough was becoming confi- 
dent that it would only be a matter 
of time before the physicist was 
back to normal and the relationships 
inside P-One more . harmonious. 

At no time did McCullough con- 
sider the possibility of the colonel 
refusing to cooperate. In the medical 
area Morrison was outranked, and 
he was not the type to . disobey a 
lawful order. 

Later, as they were all crammed 
into the control module, McCul- 
lough was relieved and pleased at 
the reception given his suggestions 
for treating Hollis. It was now ap- 
parent that the other two had felt 
a certain amount of guilt over the 
way they had behaved towards the 
physicist and were very anxious 
to make it up to him. It restored 
McCullough’s faith in people, 
especially in cold, withdrawn and not 
very friendly people like Morrison! 
and Drew. 

He would have liked to have a 
long, private talk with the two men 
as well, if only to get their side 
of the business, but in the circum- 
stances that might not be possible 
without running the risk of having 
Hollis think he had acquired an- 
other enemy instead of three 
friends. 

He had a lot to think about on 
the way back, and this time he kept 
his hands and feet in their cuffs and 
stirrups and his eyes wide open un- 
til he reached P-Two again and 
Berryman and Walters were helping 
him out of his suit and he was say- 
ing, in a tone much more serious 
than he had intended, “It’s nice to 
be home again.”

R adio interference had all but 
disappeared, so that the lec- 
tures, music, last-minute instructions 
and reminders that this was an 
epoch-making event and would they 
please not do anything silly poured 
in on them constantly and so clear- 
ly that they had no real excuse to 
switch off. They were told that they 
must at all costs remember and ap- 
ply the knowledge gained during 
their trip out. But at the same time 
they must not hesitate to forget all 
of their scientific, sociological and 
psychological theories and precon- 
ceptions if the situation warranted 
it. They were told to do, or not do, 
this several times an hour. 

One did not have to be a psy- 
chologist to realize that the people 
at Prometheus Control had worked 
themselves into a fine state of jit- 
ters. 

“The awful black immensity of 
space,” said Walters sourly during 
one of the rare radio silences. “The 
vast and aching loneliness between 
the stars. The unutterable, soul- 
destroying boredom. Dammit, they 
won’t even give us ten minutes 
peace and quiet to feel bored in** 
Shaking his head, Berryman in- 
toned, “Is some superhuman extra- 
terrestrial intelligence already brush- 
ing our minds with unfelt tendrils of 
thought, sizing us up, judging us and 
perhaps with us the whole human 
r^ce? Or is some bug-eyed bugger 
sitting at a rocket launcher just 
waiting for us to come into range?” 
“We’ve been over all this be- 
fore!” said McCullough, suddenly 



angry at the pilot for bringing up 
the subject which they all wanted 
to leave alone. Then awkwardly he 
tried to turn it into a joke by add- 
ing, “Three times in the last hour.” 

**Thrust in minus thirty seconds, 
P-Two. Stand by, P-One.** 

There was a note of self-satis- 
faction overlaying the tension in 
the voice of Control. Considering 
the fact that their computations had 
resulted in them hitting an im- 
possibly small target with both 
ships, their smugness was perhaps 
justified. But McCullough wondered, 
a little cynically, how pleased an 
arrow was with the archer when a 
bulls-eye or a miss into the sand- 
bags would result in an equally vio- 
lent headache. 

Deceleration was a strangely un- 
comfortable sensation after so many 
months of weightlessness. On Mor- 
rison’s ship thrust was delayed by 
several seconds to allow P-One to 
draw closer to P-Two — but not too 
close. It had been decided that 
Berryman’s ship would approach the 
alien vessel directly to within a dis- 
tance of one mile, with the com- 
mand pilot reporting back every 
yard of the way and using his in- 
itiative if something untoward oc- 
curred. With P-One’s more power- 
ful transmitter Morrison would relay 
these reports to Control, advising 
Berryman if or when necessary, and 
Control would do nothing but listen. 

Because of the radio time lag 
anything they might say would 
come too late to be useful. 

All decisions on procedure in the 
area of the alien ship were thus the 
responsibility of Colonel Morrison. 



28 



IF 




Berryman could exercise a little in- 
itiative to begin with, but once the 
situation was evaluated all major de- 
cisions would be taken by the colo- 
nel. As a precautionary measure the 
thrust and attitude of P-One had 
been modified so as to bring it to 
a stop fifty miles short of the 
alien ship. 

McCullough wondered what Hol- 
lis was making of that, 

I n the three weeks since he had 
visited him the physicist’s condi- 
tion, both physical and mental, had 
improved enormously. Hollis had 
spoken to him several times and 
had said so — without, of course, 
mentioning the Dirty Annie busi- 
ness. Naturally he could not dis- 
cuss his proiblem in detail on the 
intership radio, but McCullough felt 
sure that Hollis himself now realized 
that he had been imagining things, 
that he had displayed all the classic 
symptoms — together with a few 
which were uniquely his own — of 
the persecution complex. 

On the radar screen the target 
showed as a pulsing blob of light 
which crept steadily down the dis- 
tance scale. In the telescope the Ship 
grew^ and spread until it overflowed 
the field of view. Gradually P-Two’s 
velocity with respect to the other 
vessel lessened until it hung mo- 
tionless at a distance of one mile 
from the Ship. 

Like a minnow investigating a 
sleeping shark, McCullough thought. 

Berryman cleared his throat loud- 
ly and said, “The . the Ship is 
broadside on to us. I estimate its 
length at just under half a mile 



and its diameter at about one hun- 
dred yards. The diameter is uniform 
throughout its length, like a tor- 
pedo, except where it curves in- 
wards at nose and stem. Two thirds 
of the way towards the stern — 
I’m assuming it is the stern because 
Jhe other end contains more trans- 
parent material — the hull is en- 
circled by a belt of large, transparent 
blisters. Twelve of them, I think. 
The sun is shining directly into one 
and I can see metallic reflections. 

“There is another cluster of trans- 
parent domes encircling the nose,” 
he went on, “but these are smaller 
and flatter — possibly housing the 
Ship’s communications and sensory 
equipment, while the bigger ones 
are either weapons or . or . 
maybe Professor Pugh would have 
some ideas on what they are, be- 
cause there is nothing visible on 
the ship resembling a conventional 
rocket motor or even a jet orifice.” 

The pilot was dividing his at- 
tention between the telescope and 
the direct-vision port. His voice was 
quiet, controlled and ostentatiously 
matter-of-fact. But every time he 
moved perspiration beading his 
forehead was shaken loose and hung 
suspended away from his face, like 
the stylized sweat of startlement of 
a character in a comic strip. Walt- 
ers’s lower lip had disappeared be- 
hind his upper teeth. McCullough 
did not know how he himself looked, 
but he did not feel at all well. 

Berryman went on steadily, “We 
are beaming signal patterns denot- 
ing, we hope, intelligence at them 
on a wide spread of frequencies 
and we are igniting flares every fif-

teen minutes. So far there has been 
no response. I don’t understand this 
— we’re not exactly sneaking up 
on them. Have I permission to move 
in?” 

To give him credit, Morrison did 
not warn them to be careful or re- 
mind them, again, of the absolute 
necessity of doing the right thing. 
Instead he said, **Very well. We will 
close to one mile and proceed to 
cover you.” 

“What with?” said McCullough, 
in spite of himself. 

He had been thinking about Hol- 
lis again and the physicist’s delusion 
about a Dirty Annie on P-One. Mc- 
Cullough wondered suddenly if such 
delusions were contagious, like some 
kind of psychosomatic head-cold. 

figure of speech, Doctor. We 
shall furnish moral support only. 
And please remember that every- 
thing we say is being re-broadcast 
all over Earth, so k^ep this chan- 
nel clear at all times for Captain 
Berryman” 

For the past few minutes Mc- 
Cullough had completely forgotten 
that everything emanating from P- 
Two was being relayed through 
Prometheus Control all over the 
world. He could just imagine the 
battery of ground-base space medics 
playing back that section of their 
tape, discussing each word and in- 
flection in the minutest possible de- 
tail and muttering among themselves 
about father figures and archetypal 
images and basic insecurities. Mc- 
Cullough felt his face beginning to 
burn, but the two pilots were too 
busy re-positioning their ship to 
notice it. 



F or the better part of their arbi- 
trary “day” they drifted slow- 
ly back and forth along the tremen- 
dous alien hull. Each pass covered 
a different strip of its surface, al- 
lowing them to chart the various 
features it contained. When they ap- 
proached the transparent domes in 
what they assumed was the bow 
they lit a flare. 

There was no reaction, no sign of 
life of any kind. 

Berryman said, “Either there is 
nobody at home or the watch-keep- 
ing officer is asleep or worse. If it 
wasn’t for the fact that the Ship 
decelerated into a circumsolar or- 
bit, and a very neat one at that, 
I’d say there was a strong possi- 
bility that the Ship is in a derelict 
or at least distressed condition.” 

**A ship in distress usually sig- 
nals for help. As loudly and as often 
as possible.” 

“If they were telepathic,” said 
McCullough, joining in, “they might 
expect their distress to be plain for 
all to hear.” 

“// they were telepathic they 
would know that we weren*t.” 
Berryman shot the doctor a brief, 
sympathetic glance, then went on 
quickly. “They can’t or won’t re- 
act to the usual methods of attract- 
ing attention, and their ship ap- 
pears to 'be in a powered-down con- 
dition. I think it is time we knocked 
on the nearest airlock door and 
walked in — politely, of course, 
and with all due caution. 

“I suggest leaving the Doctor on 
watch,” Berryman went on, “wthile 
Walters and I have a look at the 
big seal which is passing under is 



30 



IP 




just now. It looks Kke a cargo lock 
big enough to take P-Two from 
here, and there is a smaller lock — 
for personnel, I expect — set into 
the large one. I think we could open 
it. After all, there are only so many 
ways to open a door.” 

Morrison was silent for so long 
that they wondered if he was going 
to wait for instructions from Earth 
before giving permission. But finally 
he said. *7 agree that we should 
take some more positive action, but 
Fm concerned about the possibility 
of booby-traps. Unintentional booby- 
traps in the shape of mechanisms 
whose operating principles are so 
alien as to be a danger to you.” 

“We’ll be careful, sir,” said Ber- 
ryman. 

“We’re only going to open a 
door,” Walters whispered disparag- 
ingly to the Doctor, but not quietly 
enough. 

''Pandora thought the same thing, 
Walters, you might remember that! 
However, you have permission to 
land on the Ship*s hull and open 
an airlock. Take your time about 
preparations — there must be no 
avoidable accidents. And you, Ber- 
ryman, will remain on watch. I 
can*t risk losing both pilots. Walters 
and the doctor can go , if they 
don't mind, that is. .** 

Put like that and with countless 
millions listening they had, of course, 
no choice. 

But the strange thing was that 
McCullough did not feel afraid — 
tense and impatient with all the 
waiting around, perhaps, but not 
really afraid. Earlier when they had 
been approaching the Ship for the 



first time he had been expecting 
literally anything and he had be^ 
more afraid than he had believed it 
possible for any man to be. Perl^aps 
it had been what some people called 
a moment of truth. But when the 
moment of truth spreads itself out 
over twenty-six hours, there is a con- 
siderable dilution of effect. 

McCullough launched himself in 
the wake of the pilot, slowly and 
carefully so that his magnets would 
stick to the alien hull rather than 
bounce off, and a few minuets later 
they made a gentle, sprawling con- 
tact. McCullough detached his wrist 
magnets and slowly straightened up. 

It was only then that it hit him. 

This metal plating beneath his 
feet had been shaped and processed 
from ore dug out of the earth, but 
not the Earth. 

From his position by the airlock 
the hull looked so enormous that 
he seemed almost to be standing on 
a metallic planet, complete with a 
range of beautiful transparent hills. 
The sun was shining through one 
of the blister hills, distorted by re- 
fraction into a gaudy smear which 
threw blurred highlights off what- 
ever it was that the blister con- 
tained. And this whole, vast fabri- 
cation was the product of a design 
staff and engineers who were not of 
Earth. At no stage in its construction 
had the people from McDonnell or 
BAC had one thing to do with it. 

Its reason for being might be 
as strange and alien as its makers, 
whoever and whatever they might 
be, but he felt that its basic pur- 
pose could be easily understood by 
human beings of a certain psy- 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED

chological type — the type who 
drowned or crashed or fell off 
mountains trying to climib higher 
or fly faster or dive deeper than 
their fellows. 

For some reason McCullough felt 
sure that the aliens had gone to the 
stars, had come to this star, simply 
because it was there. 

“When they were giving us all 
those lectures. Doctor,” said Walt- 
ers, displaying his genius for con- 
verting the sublime into the ridicu- 
lous, “they forgot burglary. How 
does one pick an airlock?” 

VII 

4C^T^here are only so many ways 
X for a door to open,” Walt- 
ers said, very seriously for him, 
“and I’d like, you to check me on 
them. It can be hinged to open in- 
wards or out. It can slide open by 
moving up, down or to either side. 
It can be mounted on a central 
pivot, like a buttfly valve, or it can 
unscrew. Have I left anything out?” 

“I don’t think so,” said McCul- 
lough. “But if these people were 
advanced enough to have molecular 
engineering, the entrances might iris 
open and shut.” 

“Unlikely,” said Walters. ‘The 
door and surroundings are ordinary 
metal, very roughly finished and 
showing deep scratches and dents. 
If they were capable of controlling 
the molecular binding forces of 
metal to the extent of being able 
to dilate an opening in an area of 
solid plating — of making the 
metal flow like a viscous liquid — 
they would not have scratches show- 



ing on it. These marking could have 
been made by heavy toc^s or equip- 
ment being moved into the lock 
chamber. They vary in depth and 
are of uniform brightness. 

“If the Ship were assembled in 
space the markings could have been 
made at any time during its con- 
struction and still appear fresh and 
bright. There are an awful lot of 
them, all over the place.” 

*'We would like a more detailed 
description of mechanisms in the 
area, if you can see any. I can't 
see very much with this telescope” 
The voice coming from P-One 
sounded strained, with the subtle 
difference in tone which labelled it 
for public rather than private con- 
sumption. On Earth everyone who 
could get within earshot of a radio 
— a world record listening figure 
for a single program — would be 
hanging on every word. Morrison 
could not help being conscious of 
those billions of ears. Even Walters 
seemed to be more frightened by 
them than what lay inside the Ship. 

The pilot took a deep and audi- 
ble breath, then continued. “Six 
inches from the rim of the person- 
nel lock, on the side facing aft, there 
is a lever about two feet long. It 
is set flush with the skin except 
at one end where a hemispherical 
dimple about three inches deep gives 
access to the handle.” 

He was using the term loosely, 
McCullough thought as he photo- 
graphed it, because the handle was 
not meant for hands. It terminated 
in a small knob containing two 
small, conical depressions on oppo- 
site sides, and it was the perfect 



32 



IF 




shape for a finger and thumb. Or 
pincers. 

“I’m pulling it from the recess 
now,” Walters said quickly, giving 
the colonel no time to have second 
thoughts. “I am doing it very slowly. 
There was resistance at first, sug- 
gesting spring loading, but now it is 
moving easily. This must mean a 
powered actuator rather than a 
direct linkage to the door itself. 
So far nothing has happened. The 
lever is now approximately thirty 
degrees along its angle of travel, 
approaching forty-five. Oops!” 

A brief, silent hurricane rushed 
out of the suddenly open airlock, 
and they were in the center of a 
globe of fog which dispersed al- 
most as soon as it had formed. Mc- 
Cullough reached forward, gripped 
the lever and returned it to its re- 
cess. Obediently the lock swung 
closed. He waited a few seconds, 
then opened and closed it again 
several times. 

*What is happening out there, 
dammit?** said the colonel furiously, 
momentarily forgetting the networks 
and their views on the sort of lan- 
guage suitable for family audiences. 
**What are you two playing at?** 

Walters looked at McCullough 
before replying; then he said, “This 
was an idea we discussed during 
the trip out. Very simply, it in- 
volves us leaning over backwards 
in doing all the right things — at 
least, we hope they are the right 
things. Here we are assuming that 
the reactions and motivations of the 
aliens are similar to our own where 
defense mechanisms and self-pres- 
ervation are ' concerned. 



“In the present situation,” fie 
went on, ‘Sve are entering their shij? 
surreptitiously. It might even be 
argued that we are breaking and 
entering or effecting an illegal entry 
in that we haven’t been invited to 
come in. The flares and radio sig- 
nals during our approach may not 
have been noticed. They were not 
watching or listening, or maybe they 
are very alien and do not have eyes 
or ears. But the opening and closing 
of the airlock should register in a 
fashion understandable to tfiem 
somewhere in their control center. 

“What we mean is, a burglar 
doesn’t open and close a door, or 
even a window, several times be- 
fore entering.” 

^*Very well, I take the point. But 
if a stranger slammecLmy front door 
several times to let me know he 
was there, I might feel, well, irri- 
tated.** 

While they were talking McCul- 
lough investigated the open lock, 
shining his torch around the rim 
so as to show any possible observer 
that it was simply a source of light 
and not a weapon, before directing 
the beam into the lock chamber. It 
was unlikely that anyone would be 
waiting for them inside the lock; 
their situation might be analogous 
to the coal cellar manhole rather 
than the front door, but McCul- 
lough wanted to establish habits of 
viewing each simple, innocent act 
as it might appear to non-human 
eyes and mentalities. 

He gripped the rim of the seal 
with one hand and carefully moved 
his head and shoulders into the 
opening. Even though there was no 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



33 




interior lighting, his tcwch gave him 
a good view of the lock chamber 
except where the inward opening 
seal blocked his vision on one side. 

The basic color scheme was pale 
gray or pale blue-gray. Walls, ceil- 
ing and floor — it was impossible to 
tell which was which — were cov- 
ered with disciplined masses of 
plumbing, grapples and what looked 
like lashing points for heavy stores, 
all color-coded in vivid greens, blues 
and reds. The lock chamber was 
large, about thirty feet wide and ten 
deep. Set into each wall were seals 
four or five times the area of the 
one McCullough was using, and in 
the center of each there was a 
small transparent panel. He knew 
they were transparent because his 
flash showed tantalizing glimpses 
of other brightly painted sihapes on 
the other side. From what he could 
see, this area of the Ship was in 
darkness. 

McCullough could imagine the 
chamber as a transfer point for 
containers of food and equipment, 
lashed down to render them immo- 
bile until they were distributed about 
the Ship. Heavy equipment drifting 
loose in the weightless condition 
could be a menace to alien life and 
limb as well as human. But the dis- 
position of lashing points and their 
support brackets suggested a lack 
of gravitational influence, whether 
natural, artificial or due to accelera- 
tion, being allowed for in the de- 
sign. Which might mean that the 
interior of the Ship remained per- 
manently in the weightless condi- 
tion even during periods of powered 
flight. 



Something more advanced than 
rocket propulsion was used on this 
ship. But it all looked so ... so 
unsophisticated. 

McCullough became aware of a 
hand gripping his ankle and draw- 
ing him slowly out of the lock en- 
trance and Walters saying, “What’s 
the matter, didn’t you hear what I 
said?” 

“When my helmet antenna was 
inside,” said McCullough, “your 
voice faded to nothing. Some sort 
of screening effect, I suppose?” 

“Yes. And that is the next step, 
the colonel says. Checking communi- 
cations between the lock interior 
and the P-ships.” 

A few minutes later the pilot 
entered the lock chamber and closed 
the seal behind him. From inside 
he could not make himself heard 
or receive the colonel’s signal until 
he brought his antenna into contact 
with the metal of the hull, when 
two-way communication was possi- 
ble although with a greatly dim- 
inished signal strength. 

Walters reopened the seal, and 
when McCullough joined him in- 
side he closed it again. 

Morrison did not sound happy 
over what they were doing. At the 
risk of disappointing the countless 
millions of eager listeners at home he 
stated several times that his men 
needed rest — the next stage of the 
investigation was crucial, and he 
wanted them to be fully alert. It had 
been almost thirty-two hours since 
any of them had a proper rest 
period. He suspected that the two 
men on the Ship were becoming too 
tired even to talk. 



34 



IF 




‘‘Sarcastic so-and-so,” said Wal- 
ters, momentarily breakhig antenna 
contact with the near-by bulkhead. 
A tremendous, eye-wat wring, jaw- 
wrenching yawn put a great dark 
hole in his face, and he went on, “I 
wasn’t even tired until he reminded 
me! But you had better talk to him. 
I want to trace this cable loom run- 
ning along the inside face of the 
chamber. The wiring seems too fine 
to carry much juice so it may be 
part of the internal communications 
or lighting system. 

‘Tell the colonel what I’m doing, 
along with anything else which oc- 
curs to you.” 

McCullough did so, beginning 
with a minutely detailed description 
of the chamber and the view through 
its five internal windows and going 
on to make the first twitative con- 
clusions regarding the Ship and its 
builders. 

The cable looms, conduits and 
plumbing were color-coded in a 
garish variety of shades, some of 
them bearing permutations of other 
colored spots, bands or stripes. A 
human electronics engineer would 
have felt almost at home here, Mc- 
Cullough thought. 

Fore, aft and on the floor and 
ceiling the chamber’s transparent 
panels, so far as it was possible 
to see with a flashlight, showed a 
similar arrangement in the adjacent 
compartments. Apparently the cham- 
ber was set between the ship’s outer 
and inner hull, in the space which 
contained the vessel’s power, con- 
trol and sensory equipment. The 
lock chamber, which must be one 
of many, would give access to the 



inter-hull space for purposes of 
repair or maint^ajnce. The in- 
board facing window gave a view 
which contained least of all to 
see — merely a section of corridor, 
eight feet square and of unknown 
length, whose four sides were cov- 
ered with large-mesh netting pulled 
taught. 

The visible mechanical and 
structural features gave an overall 
impression of crudeness. There was 
no sign of lightening holes or cut- 
outs in any of the support brackets 
or structural members, no indica- 
tion that considerations of weigiht 
or power-mass ratios had entered 
into the designers’ calculations. 

“It is too soon to make any 
hard and fast assumptions about 
them,” McCullough went on. “We 
know that they do not have fingers, 
and may have a two-digit pincer ar- 
rangement. Probably their visual 
range and sensitivity is similar to 
ours, judging by the color intensi- 
ties used on cable identification. The 
to us crude and unnecessarily ro- 
bust construction of minor structural 
details indicates a lack of concern 
over weight and the power required 
to get it moving. The corridor net- 
ting suggests that they are not ad- 
vanced enough to possess an arti- 
ficial gravity system, and the total 
absence of light and movement 
shows that the Ship is orbiting in 
a power-down condition .... WaU 
ters!'* 

In the corridor outside the cham- 
ber, the lights had come on. 

CiQ^orry, that was me,*- said WaU 
ters sheepishly. “I*ve dis-

covered what a light switch looks 
like, but I must have guessed 
wrong. The light in the cor- 
ridor went off and on several times, 
then suddenly the lock chamber 
lighting came on. He added, “Better 
tell the colonel about this, too.*’ 

McCullough informed the colonel 
that Walters had found the light 
switches, had experimented with 
them and that the Ship’s illumina- 
tion was a bright, bluish white em- 
anating from tubes which they had 
mistaken for sections of plumbing. 
There was still no reaction from the 
alien crew, and McCullough was 
beginning to wonder if the Ship had 
a crew. 

**You two seem to have a weak- 
ness for slamming doors and 
switching lights on! However, this 
wraps it up for the time being. We 
need rest. Return to P-Two. We 
have a lot to think about before 
we do anything else on that ship. 
Say so if you understand** 

“Understood, sir,” said Walters. 
“But we would like a sample of 
Ship’s air before we leave. Five min- 
utes should do it.” 

McCullough was beginning to feel 
irritable and very tired, and he did 
want the chance to analyze as soon 
as possible whatever atmosphere it 
was that the aliens breathed. But the 
thought kept recurring to him that 
he was not very very cautious about 
this, that he was breaking even his 
own rules, and that fatigue was a 
little like drunkenness in that it made 
people take chances. 

Walters opened the corridor seal, 
and the alien air roared into the lock 
chamber. Their suits lost their taut, 



puffy appearance and hung loosely 
against their bodies. Ship pressure 
seemed to be a pound or two per 
square inch higher than suit pres- 
sure, McCullough thought as he 
took the sample. The pilot was mov- 
ing toward the open seal. 

“I’m only going to take a look,” 
said Walters. 

McCullough joined him. 

There was only one source of 
light in the corridor, the one 
switched on by Walters, so that 
both ends disappeared into black- 
ness. But suddenly McCullough felt 
the wall netting vibrate and • . 
something . was shooting towards 
them along the corridor. 

McCullough flung himself back, 
but Walters, who had a leg and 
arm outside the rim at the time, 
fumbled and was slower getting in. 
The doctor had a glimpse of some- 
thing rushing past the opening, 
something which looked a little like 
a heavy, leathery starfish, then 
Walters reached the lock actuator 
and the seal slammed closed. 

The pilot remained floating with 
one hand gripping the actuator lever 
and the other resting ludicrously on 
his hip. His face was white and 
sweating, his eyes squeezed shut. 

“It can’t get in, now — we’re 
safe — ” began McCullough, then 
stopped. 

Walters was not safe. There was a 
large, triangular tear in the fabric 
of his suit at the right hip. The 
undergarment showed through it, 
also a section of the air-conditioning 
system looking strangely like a bared 
artery, although the leg itself did 
not appear to be injured. 



36 



IF 




The pilot was trying to hold the 
tear closed with his hand. But it 
was too big, the edges too ragged 
and the pressure difference was too 
great to keep the alien atmosphere 
from forcing its way into his suit. 
He began to cough. 

VIII 

M ore than anything else he had 
ever wanted in his whole life, 
McCullough wanted out. Never be- 
fore had the cramped and stinking 
confines of the command module 
seemed so desirable and secure. And 
P-Two was drifting less than a hun- 
dred yards away, with Berryman on 
watch ready to help him inside and 
take him away from this suddenly 
frightful place. All he had to do was 
operate one childishly simple lever. 

It would mean evacuating the 
chamber, of course. Walters would 
die of explosive decompression. But 
the pilot was strangling to death in 
an alien atmosphere anyway, and the 
other might be quicker and more 
merciful .... 

Except that Berryman might not 
want to leave without Walters, and 
explosive decompression was not a 
nice way to die, and in his student 
days McCullough had been pretty 
thoroughly conditioned against mercy 
killing. 

“Doctor,” said Walters between 
coughs, “do you have — a band- 
aid on you?” 

“What?” said McCullough, then 
added with feeling, “Dammit, Fm 
stupidr 

A length of adhesive with its wash- 
able plastic backing would not hold 



the tear together in vacuo, but with 
pressure almost equal between cham- 
ber and suit interior it would act 
as a barrier to the entry of the alien 
air all around them. For a time, at 
least. Quickly McCullough took a 
dressing from his kit and pressed the 
edges of the tear together while Wal- 
ters rubbed on the tape. 

When they were finished McCul- 
lough said, “How do you feel? Any 
pain in the chest? Nausea? Impair- 
ment of vision?” 

Walters shook his head. Almost 
strangling himself with his effort not 
to cough, he said, “The ... the 
smell is like ammonia ... or for- 
maldehyde. Strong and sharp but not 
... a stinking smell. But you’d bet- 
ter tell the colonel.” 

McCullough nodded and laid his 
antenna against the metal wall. 

The colonel interrupted him only 
once to ask what the pilot had been 
doing out in the corridor, then he 
told McCullough to continue with 
his report without trying to make 
excuses for Walters’s stupidity. The 
doctor did so, spending less time on 
the incident itself than on the prob- 
lems it had raised. 

**Can you tie off the leg section 
tightly enough to avoid a lethal pres- 
sure drop for the few minutes it will 
take to get him back to P-Two? It 
would mean decompressing the leg, 
of course, but that would be better 
than — ” 

“No, sir. The tear is high on the 
left hip. We can’t evacuate Ijie cham- 
ber while he is in it And I can’t 
leave, and nobody from outside can 
enter unless — ” 

""Unless Walters goes back into the 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



37 




corridor while the chamber is airless. 
Ask him how he feels about doing 
that:* 

The pilot’s reply had to be edited 
and censored considerably. McCul- 
lough said, “He’ll do it. But he doesn’t 
feel too enthusiastic.” 

Morrison refused to comment on 
Walters’s feelings. He said, **That 
takes care of your return. But getting 
him back to P~Two means putting 
him in another suit.** 

There were several good reasons 
why the P-ships did not carry spare 
spacesuits. Quite apart from the ex- 
tra weight and stowage requirements 
involved there was the fact that a 
spacesuit had to be literally tailored 
to fit its wearer, and this would have 
meant carrying a spare for every 
member of the expedition. As well, 
damage to a suit usually meant death 
for its wearer, so that repairs were 
not even considered. In any case re- 
pairing a suit was a specialist’s job 
requiring facilities not available on 
the ships. 

**Both Hollis and Berryman are 
close to Walters in size,** the colonel 
went on, **and Berryman is closest in 
distance, 1*11 shoot Drew across to 
you. While he*s on the way Berry^ 
man can place his suit in P~Two*s 
airlock. Drew will pick it up and 
deliver it to you for Walters and coU 
lect your air sample. 

'"You, Doctor, will stay with Wal- 
ters to see that his seals are tight 
and the suit isn*t strained dangerously 
by forcing the fit. As well as losing 
one of our trained pilots we can*t 
afford to write off another suit. What 
is his condition now?** 

Walters had his antenna in con- 



tact with the plating, listening. He 
tried to speak, broke into a fit of 
coughing, and made a rude gesture in- 
stead. 

McCullough translated. “He has a 
persistent cough which may be due 
to throat irritation only. There are 
no other respiratory symptoms, no 
chest pain and no detectable toxic 
effects. His morale is good.” The 
doctor did not know these things with 
any degree of certainty — his optim- 
ism was mostly for his patient’s bene- 
fit. But just in case the colonel did 
not realize what McCuUou^ was do- 
ing he added quickly. “But I’d like 
to give him a thorough checkup in 
shirt-sleeve conditions as soon as pos- 
sible.” 

A little later Morrison told them 
Drew was on his way and that he 
was moving his own ship in to join 
P-Two. Tactically this was not a 
good move, he said, but on this oc- 
casion tactics and common sense 
seemed to be at variance, and in 
any case they could pull out quickly 
if it became necessary. 

“And go home?” asked McCul- 
lough. 

“7 don*t know. Doctor. There are 
other considerations:* 

s the period of high drama, the 
first and unfortunately violent 
contact with the aliens passed, the 
colonel began to worry over the pos- 
sibility that Prometheus Control had 
not faded out the networks during 
the incident with Walters and the 
alien. Aware suddenly of a possible 
audience they became laconic to the 
point of sounding ridiculous. Stiffly, 
the colonel wished Walters Good 





Luck. Walters said, “Thanks.” Berry- 
man suggested McCullough should 
make a sketch of the alien from 
memory while they were waiting on 
Drew. Morrison said it was a good 
idea, just in case. Nobody asked in 
case of what. 

During the twenty minutes or so 
it took for Drew to reach them — 
in subjective time it felt more like 
ten years — McCullough sketched 
the alien and made a map of the 
vicinity of their lock chamber. While 
doing so he discovered a leak in one 
of the pipe joints. Probably the re- 
peated opening and closing of the 
seal had put an unfair strain on the 
hydraulic system — the joint was 
sweating, and droplets of a clear 
brownish liquid hung around it, 
steaming faintly. 

McCullough hoped nothing calam- 
itous would happen when the cham- 
ber was evacuated. 

Drew arrived, checked by radio 
on the o^ration of the lock, then 
waited while McCullough opened the 
inner seal and entered the corridor 
with Walters. As the air rushed out 
of the chamber and Drew swam in, 
a fogginess appeared around the leak- 
ing joint. But nothing else seemed 
to be happening. 

There were no aliens visible in 
the lighted section of corridor. 

“If one of them comes at us,” 
McCullough told Walters, “I’ll hang 
onto the net and kick at it with both 
feet. You concentrate on holding that 
patch in position.” 

He was beginning to feel that the 
pilot’s trouble had been his own 
rather than Walters’s fault. 

The leak in the lock’s hydraulic 



system was bothering him. It was al- 
most certainly a recent malfunction. 
There was a strong probability that 
it had occurred because the seal-actu- 
ator mechanism had been recently 
overstressed. McCullough had for- 
gotten how many times exactly they 
had opened and closed the thing, 
something like seventeen or eighteen 
times in as many minutes, while the 
chances were that normal usage was 
on the order of twice a day. 

He was assuming, of course, that 
these were not omnipotent aliens and 
that their ship might occasionally de- 
velop mechanical faults. Such failures 
would show in their control center 
and a member of the crew might be 
sent to check on it, or perhaps deal 
with the real cause of the trouble — 
the human invaders. McCullough was 
coming to realize that their actions, 
which had been meant simply to ad- 
vertise their presence on board, could 
just as well be construed as criminal- 
ly irresponsible or wantonly destruct- 
ive. In these circumstances a certain 
amount of hostility on the part of the 
aliens would be understandable. 

People who leaned over backwards, 
McCullough thought grimly, frequent- 
ly fell flat on their face. 

“Walters. Doctor.” Drew’s voice 
came suddenly. “The colonel sent you 
a weapon of sorts. To be used only in 
self-defense, he says. Grip it in the 
middle and stab with it like a spear.” 

McCullough looked up and down 
the still empty corridor, then into 
the chamber. He said, “It’s just a 
length of pipe.” 

“A blunt bayonet makes a worse 
mess than a sharp one,” Drew said 
cheerfully, “and a length of one-inch 



40 



IF 




pipe is about as blunt as a weapon 
can get. Just take time to aim and 
jab hard. I guarantee it will discourage 
any man or beastie not wearing a suit 
of armor. I’m leaving now. Good 
luck.” 

A few seconds later he was blown 
through the outer door by escaping 
air, and another eternity passed 
while he jetted back to the hidl and 
closed it again. Walters and Mc- 
Cullough re-entered the chamber, 
still without alien interference. 

T he problem now was to get Wal- 
ters out of his damaged suit and 
into the replacement quickly enough 
to keep him from being gassed. Mc- 
Cullough started by opening the 
pilot’s face-plate, taping up his nos- 
trils and making him breathe slowly 
through his oxygen line. Then he 
wrapped his legs around the pilot’s 
waist and began cutting away the 
damaged suit. 

It was hard, painstaking work. The 
plastic and metal foil was difficult to 
cut with a scalpel, and McCullough 
was all too aware of the skin and 
blood vessels lying just a fraction of 
an inch below. The drying unit in 
his own suit refused to cope with 
the increased flow of perspiration; his 
visor was fogging badly despite its 
special coating, and he wasn’t dissipat- 
ing nearly enough of his body heat. 

This would be a great time to pass 
out from heat stroke. 

Quickly he slit the legs, arms and 
chest, peeling them away to leave 
only the shoulder section which con- 
tained the air supply and hinged- 
back helmet. There followed a weight- 
less adagio dance, and he drew the 



new suit onto the pilot’s legs and 
arms while the tatters of the old one 
hung out from his back. Walters could 
not give him much help because the 
alien atmosphere was making his 
eyes stream. No matter how hard he 
tried he could not stop coughing — 
which drew more of the stuff into 
his lungs. By the time he told Wal- 
ters to hyperventilate and hold his 
breath while the changeover was com- 
pleted, McCullough was afraid that 
he had already breathed in too much 
of it. 

Finally they were ready to leave. 
The discarded suit twisted slowly, like 
some shredded, dismembered corpse, 
in the mist which was growing visibly 
in the area of the leak. McCullough 
wondered what the aliens would make 
of it, what they would infer and de- 
duce regarding the human race. The 
thought made him look towards the 
transparent panel in the door. 

There were three of them. 

McCullough pushed himself toward 
the corridor door without thinking — 
the reason for doing it seemed to 
come after the action rather than 
before. To Walters he said quickly, 
“If they open that door the outer 
one won’t open — there’s sure to be 
a safety interlock system — and if 
they see us trying to leave they will 
surely open it. I’ll move close to the 
window and block their view while 
you open the outer seal. The suction 
will pull us out. Where’s that blasted 
pipe?” 

He couldn’t see it. Probably it was 
hiding in plain sight against a back- 
ground of Ship plumbing, a tree hid- 
ing in a forest. 

His idea was to hold their atten- 

41 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 




tion somehow while blocking their 
view of what Walters was doing. To 
do so he had to get close to the 
transparent door ‘panel and either 
arouse their interest or frighten them 
away. McCullough did not know of 
anything he could do which would 
prove fascinating to the aliens, but he 
just might be able to worry them a 
little with his camera. 

It was a beautiful instrument which 
fairly bristlejd with supplementary 
lenses and attachments. It might very 
easily be mistaken for a weapon. 

I n some deep recess of his mind 
a small voice was reminding him 
insistently of ±e need to consider 
the alien point of view and to do 
nothing to give them the wrong idea 
about humanity and human behavior. 
McCullough felt a moment’s shame, 
but he was really much too frightened 
to listen. 

There was no perceptible reaction 
from the e-ts as McCullough drifted 
up to the window, still aiming his 
camera. One of them was drifting in 
the center of the corridor, a stubby, 
dumbbell shape covered with long 
spikes. Each half of its body was 
roughly the size of a football, and 
there were no sensory or manipula- 
tory organs visible. A second alien 
clung to the opposite wall-net like a 
great, fleshy spider, giving him a per- 
fect plan view of the starfish body 
with its thick tentacles and leathery 
tegument. The tentacles ended in 
boney pincers, like white, miniature 
elephant tusks. He estimated its physi- 



cal mass to be approximately half 
that of a man with the tentacle length 
between four and five feet. 

The third alien was of the same 
species as number Two. It covered 
part of the window with its body so 
that McCullough and his camera had 
a perfect view of its underbelly, 
which was soft and pinkish brown 
and convoluted into folds and open- 
ings which were evidently mouths or 
gills or sensory equipment of some 
kind, all grouped around a large, 
sharp, centrally placed horn or sting. 

McCullough swallowed hard. He 
thought that on the purely physical 
evidence these were not nice people. 

Then suddenly the aliens began to 
move. McCuUough still wasn’t sure 
where their eyes were, but somehow 
he knew that their focus of atten- 
tion had changed. Something was 
approaching along the corridor. He 
could not get his eyes close enough 
to the window to see, although he 
could hear low, gobbling sounds be- 
ing transmitted through the metal of 
the door to his helmet. Quickly he 
stepped down his lens and aimed it 
along the dark corridor. It had a 
wider angle of view and might see 
more than he could. 

The first three aliens were leaving. 

Walters opened the outer seal at 
that moment and the rush of escaping 
air drew him away from the door, 
spinning him slowly end over end. 
But not before he had a glimpse of 
something covered with white fur, or 
perhaps clothing, which flicked past 
the window.

Intelligence is knowing when 
to fights when to run — and 
when to give up and drop dead! 



I n the cometary regions out past 
Pluto a spot of light flickered 
briefly. The Hirokan spacer braked 
fiercely down from the dark gamma 
radiation of faster than light, through 
the visible spectrum of slowing re- 
lativistic speeds and into the invisi- 
bility of sublight. She was met nearly 
to the same cubic mile of nothing- 
ness by a smaller Hirokan vessel. 

“Nice navigation,” Admiral Ikara 
said to the captain. It certainly was, 
considering the destroyer had come 
fifty light-years to an almost exact 
rendezvous with the yacht sent from 
the Hirokan embassy on Earth. 

The captain bowed modestly, 
silently thanking his ancestors on his 
good foresight in securing a top navi- 
gator for the trip. He was equally 
happy he hadn’t been spotted by a 



warship from the unfriendly area he 
had just traversed. He had been 
obliged to swap his best gunnery offi- 
cer for the navigator. There was an 
old Hirokan saying, “Politics makes 
perfect.” 

“Sir,” the captain said, “the less 
time we linger here, the better. The 
comets will mask us just so long.” 
He pointed toward the personnel 
transfer torp. The ten-foot-long pro- 
jectile was in its cradle, ready to 
launch. 

Efficiently, the admiral stretched 
full length in the torp. He pressed the 
studs sealing it and almost imme- 
diately felt the shove of acceleration, 
almost as quickly followed by the 
counter push of braking. A brief 
clanging and the torp was opened 
from the outside. By the numbers, he

thought and felt a fierce pride in 
Hirokan military efficiency. 

He unfolded himself from the 
torp, knowing the destroyer was al- 
ready gone. The yacht was in motion, 
too. He acknowledged the yacht com- 
mander’s salute, noting the civilian 
dress. “How long to planetfall?” he 
asked. 

“Sixteen point three hours, sir.” 
Seeing the admiral’s stare, he flushed 
and changed his figures to the Hiro- 
kan equivalent. 

“You must have been on Earth 
quite some time,” the admiral com- 
mented dryly. 

“Embassy duty, sir, nearly three 
— ” He choked and changed what 
he was about to say from “years” 
to Hirokan figures. 

The admiral looked at him closely. 
“Two tours of duty, eh? I guess you 
could pass pretty well for an Earth- 
man.” Captain Cochi looked very 
much like one-third of Earth’s in- 
habitants — skin between light olive 
and dark lemon, eyes slightly slant- 
ing. 

“Oh, I 'do! I just change into regu- 
lar Earth clothes and I can go 
everywhere without attracting atten- 
tion. I’m pretty close to average 
height and weight. I suppose that’s 
why I was picked for the embassy. 
But believe me. I’d rather be out on 
the frontier fighting!” 

The admiral smiled at this. “Natur- 
ally, every fighting man wants to 
fight. I gather, though, there’s some- 
thing particularly unpleasant about 
the assignment.” 

“Well, it’s just that Earth is so 
backwards. I realize that’s good for 
us, but the place simply reeks of 



AN IF FIRST

published story of a brand-new science- 
fiction writer. This month's "first" is Joy

the country's most active fans. Jay Kay

savagery. Hordes of people crowding 
everywhere, polluting the air, water, 
and tlie very surface of the planet.” 

“Stinks, eh?” 

“Yes, sir. You’ve never seen such 
a crowd. People practically sleeping 
in the streets. In fact, on some parts 
of Earth they do sleep in the streets. 
They even pollute their lungs with 
deliberately breathed smoke. It’s 
worse than the inside of a troop trans- 
port.” 

The admiral had already been 
briefed on Earth conditions. The 
planet was far from the Hirokan 
sphere of influence, but an embassy 
was maintained as part of general 
policy to keep an eye on potential 
threats and possible conquests. The 
admiral was on a mission to check 
out personally reports Earth might 
be changing from a potential con- 
quest to an active threat. 

Admiral Ikara said. “Doesn’t sound 
as if they have too much intelligence 
if they treat their home that way.” 

The captain smiled. It was an 
axiom that Hirokans were the only 
real people, with real brains. Other 



44 



IF 





peoples were little more than animals, 
to be tamed when possible or de- 
stroyed when necessary. 

T he hours passed, with the admiral 
taking in the impressions of the 
captain and the other members of the 
crew that were normally stationed 
as civilians in the embassy. A sleep 
period intervened. When Admiral 
Ikara awoke, he found the captain 
waiting for him. 

“Sir, I thought you might like to 
see one of the few wonders of this 
wretched little system. We’ll be pass- 
ing by one of the gas giants shortly.” 
Constructed as a speedy vessel for 
personal enjoyment, the yacht had an 
observation deck that could be dark- 
ened and opened optically to the out- 
side. Saturn came into view, the 
rings glittering against the backdi»p 
of star-strewn space. The rings en- 
circled a whirling ball of cyclone- 
stirred gases. 

“Beautiful,” the admiral said. “I’m 
pleased you passed by here.” He 
looked sharply at the captain. “This 
won’t compromise us?” 

Captain Gochi made a depreca- 
tory motion. “Not at all. Yachts are 
common enough around here. It’s 
quite a tourist spot. It would probably 
be more suspicious if we detoured.” 
He added, “Of course, the rings won’t 
be around too much longer.” 

“They look stable enough to me. 
Light pressure can’t be too intense 
this far from the primary.” 

“No, sir, it’s the ring miners. Little 
ships bring Earthmen out to hunt 
for diamonds. Lots of them die. Some 
are lucky. But every orbital maneuver 
or scoop attempt disturbs the rocks 



and pebbles making up the rings. The 
perturbations are accumulative and 
will spread the rings out eventually 
to form a barely noticeable wisp 
around the planet.” 

“That’s pretty dumb. You mean 
to say they’d destroy something as 
magnificent as this for some lousy 
crystallized carbon? They could make 
all they want in a factory.” 

The captain shrugged. “It’s a cus- 
tom on Earth to place' a diamond 
on the finger of a woman when she 
marries. Earthmen claim a synthetic 
diamond isn’t good enough.” 

“How can they possibly tell the 
difference?” 

“A synthetic diamond is perfect. 
The natural diamond has flaws the 
Earthmen are fond of.” 

The admiral snorted. “Match their 
women, no doubt.” 

Captain Gochi laughed, thinking 
of the Earth women he’d known. 
“Personally, I like their flaws. They’re 
not bright, but they are most active 
at the right time.” 

The ship made planetfail on the 
night side and came down under anti- 
radar screening at a private field con- 
trolled secretly by the Hirokan gov- 
ernment. All but a skeleton crew left 
the ship and headed back to the em- 
bassy to take up their interrupted 
duties. 

Admiral Ikara was escorted by the 
captain to the embassy, taken to the 
thirtieth floor penthouse and turned 
over to the ranking official. Ambas- 
sador Sushi bowed three times, cere- 
moniously, reciprocated by the ad- 
miral. 

“Most welcome, honored sir,” said 
the ambassador. “I am pleased, in-

deed. We have never before been 
visited by a member of the Imperial 
War Staff.” 

“Somebody’s got to look into the 
events we’ve been hearing about. 
Your reports indicate the situation 
could be turning serious.” 

The admiral stopped, said through 
clenched teeth, “We are in a maxi- 
mum security area, I presume?” 
Startled, the ambassador said, “Of 
course! We are absolutely screened 
against any radio frequency penetra- 
tion. The room is swept clean of any 
possible mechanical pickup device. 
And that inch-thick acoustic curtain is 
drawn over three vacuum-insulated 
layers of glass in the window.” 
Satisfied, the admiral relaxed. He 
started questioning the ambassador. 

A cross the street, there was feverish 
activity on the thirtieth and 
thirty-first floors of the skyscraper 
facing the Hirokan embassy. The 
head of Earth’s secret service was 
there with a half-dozen aides. An- 
other half-dozen technicians were 
anxiously checking scope patterns, 
talking to a computer in advanced 
symbio-loglan and going through the 
usual routines of getting balky, com- 
plex equipment to work. 

One of the aides couldn’t take 
the pressure any longer and snarled 
at a technician, “Get the damned 
thing working, willya! God knows 
what’s going on across the street.” 
Chief Oxblood said, “No use mak- 
ing the guy nervous, Joe.” He turned 
to the technician. “Do your best.” 
The technician was already doing 
his best. After all, it wouldn’t be 
pleasant to wind up on a Chlorella 



farm» with nothing to look forward 
to after a hard day’s work skimming 
chlorella algae but a bowl of algae 
mush for dinner and a chloropsyll- 
stained mattress bare of any comforts, 
such as feminine companionship. Oh, 
the technician tried, all right. 

Joe said, “Chief, do you really 
think this is the big moment, right 
now?” 

The chief packed a pipe with to- 
bacco and lit it. Puffing at it, he 
said, “Everything points to it. First, 
Whatsizname drops from sight — 
that war fleet captain who’s officially 
listed as a cook and goes out on the 
town every night thinking no one 
doesn’t know he’s a Hirokan. Then 
our man at the Hirokan field reports 
a space yacht with lots of sizzle is 
gone, and we don’t have any record 
of it. Just took off without clear- 
ance. 

“Naturally, we figure someone is 
being conveyed in quietly. That’s not 
like the Hiroku. Usually, they’d just 
as soon bust in with an armored boat 
as not. Arrogant bastards! So, the fact 
they’re being secret shows something 
important is going on. Then we get a 
report from a diamond miner on the 
Rings that something going like a 
bat out of Hell zips in from Outside 
midway between moons I and II. 

“Suddenly, the yacht reappears like 
magic on the field, and Captain 
Watsizname is back making like a 
sailor on shore leave after a voyage 
to Sumatra. Didn’t take him five min- 
utes. He must have been wearing his 
civvies all the way. Yeh, their gear 
is damn good, but their security leaks 
like a sieve.” 

Joe nodded. “I’ve got our usual

operation working on Captain Gochi, 
trying to pump him.” 

Another agent joined in. “Who’s 
trying to pump whom?” And he 
laughed. 

Joe shot back, “One good turn 
deserves another! We pay her and he 
pays her. All in a day’s work.” 

The technician interrupted. “I 
think I’m getting it, sir. I’m feeding 
the data to the computer, and we 
should start getting the readout in a 
couple of minutes,” 

From three lenses set into the 
outer skin of the thirtieth floor, three 
infrared laser beams, each tuned to 
a slightly different wavelength, 
bounced off the window of the em- 
bassy penthouse opposite. Each made 
a slightly differing amount of pene- 
tration of the three layers of glass. 
Three very much weakened reflec- 
tions of differing intensity came 
bouncing back. These were picked 
up by phototransistors capable of 
rapid modulation. 

An agent asked, “I understand 
how the laser pickup works in princi- 
ple, but I’m damned if I can see how 
we can get anything through a dou- 
ble vacuum seal and an acoustic cur- 
tain.” 

The technician had relaxed, now 
that the scope traces told him every- 
thing was going nicely to the com- 
puter. He said, “With a single piece 
of glass or the usual airfill heat in- 
sulation, a single laser reflection 
would be modulated by slight move- 
ments of the glass. These are in 
response to the air pressure variations 
caused by sound in a room. With 
the setup across the street, though, 
we couldn’t get enough waveform 



amplitude to do any decoding. So 
we take three beams and use their 
slight amplitude beating against each 
other to form a frequency modulated 
carrier that can be decoded with 
computer enhancement.” 

“Hey,” Joe protested, “I’m no tech, 
but vacuum insulation wouldn’t allow 
even that mess of gobbledegook to 
work.” 

Chief Oxblood smiled. “Our fa- 
vorite operative got into that room 
one night, when it was our noble 
captain’s turn on duty. While the 
captain went to the bathroom, our 
girl fked that vacuum but good. She 
received quite a bonus. After all, we 
want our captain to have a long 
and happy tour of duty. You never 
can tell, they might send a replace- 
ment with some sense.” 

A ll talk ceased as the speaker hook- 
up suddenly started giving the 
translation of what was being said 
in the room across the street. Two 
differently pitched voders were used 
to distinguish the two Hirokan 
voices. Otherwise, the mechanical 
speech synthesizer would make it 
hard to tell one talker from another. 

“So, you reported these Earth 
creatures are leaving the planet and 
establishing bases outside the system. 
That could be dangerous. If they ever 
become widespread enough to estab- 
lish a defense network, we’d have 
a miserable job cleaning them out.” 
“We had reason to think so, at the 
time of our last report. Of course, 
you’ve been traveling for quite some 
time and we’ve had some additional 
evidence turn up since then. Fortun- 
ately, our alarms seem unfounded.” 



ON CONQUERED EARTH

“It had better be convincing, or 
I’ll recommend to the War Staff that 
we turn our attention from our Spiral 
Arm frontiers and take an excursion 
this way as a preventive measure.” 

At this point, the computer final- 
ly worked out the proper pattern 
through a fantastically complex pro- 
cess and added vision to the sound. 
It wasn’t too good, since an acoustic 
hologram reconstruction lacks fine 
resolution. But the secret service men 
could make out the agonized expres- 
sion on Ambassador Sushi’s face. 

“Really, Admiral, I hate to be the 
one to cause a change in policy and 
louse up our long-range expansion 
plans toward Galactic Center. It’s no 
secret that if we let up pressure, we 
will lose^ lot of hard-won momen- 
tum. After all, even our resources 
aren’t infinite.” 

“Look, just give me the informa- 
tion. Earth is pretty backwards just 
now, but those gas giants in the sys- 
tem give it an energy potential that 
is simply staggering. If we’re not 
careful, a couple of generations from 
now we could find ourselves frozen 
out from this entire sector. But don’t 
worry, if it looks safe enough, I’ll 
report we should just sit back for 
a while longer and keep an eye on 
things.” 

Through the fuzzy, writhing moire 
patterns of the probe screen, the 
secret service agents saw 'Ambassa- 
dor Sushi open a desk compartment 
and take out a recorder. He said, 
“Our demographic experts noted a 
slight but significant decrease in the 
rate of increase in the Earth popu- 
lation.” 

“So I understand. Off hand, I 



couldn’t think of a more sensible ar- 
rangement.” 

“Quite so. Except that, as we 
know, Earthmen aren’t reasonable. 
The birth rate has been climbing with 
mathematical precision for hundreds 
of years. Now we find a substantial 
number of persons, male and female, 
are disappearing each year. Children, 
too, I might add.” 

“And this made you think Earth- 
men were sending colonies out? What 
about transport ships?” 

The ambassador shrugged. “The 
system is crawling with ships, coming 
and going. All the planets and most 
of the satellites have colonies. There’s 
no way of keeping tabs on ships.” 
He eyed the admiral slyly. “Unless, of 
course, you’d care to assign half a 
fleet on permanent watch.” 

“Of course not. We might just as 
well take a whole fleet, smash our 
way through fifty light-years of hos- 
tile territory and knock the Earth out 
once and for all.” 

“Quite so. Therefore, I thought it 
best to investigate the matter from 
this end. During your trip here, I 
had one of our men follow up the 
leads we had uncovered. Here’s the 
report.” 

A mbassador Sushi started the play- 
back mechanism. The listening 
secret service men heard a third 
voder voice. “The lab boys tell me 
the recorder can’t be seen and is in- 
detectable. Made out of synthaflesh 
plastic and all that. Just the same, I 
sure can feel it. I will just have to 
sit down gently, I guess. It must be 
four inches deep in my left buttock. 
I’d like to plant one in a lab boy.

“As long as no one can stop me, I 
think ni say doing one’s duty can 
be a pain in the rear sometimes. 
Lucky, the vocal pickup is no prob- 
lem. I just subvocalize, like I’m doing 
now, and the pickup sends hydronic 
wavesdown to the recorder. 

“Uh, oh, here I am at the, ah, I 
guess you’d call it recruiting station. 
I’m just a poor Chlorella skimmer 
answering an ad for easy work and 
good pay. Lots of people are filling 
out forms. Say, some the girls here 
have pretty good forms. If it wasn’t 
for the smell, I could really go for 
some of these. Sometimes I wish I 
was more like Captain Gochi. You 
can get a lot more out of life that 
way. 

“I’ve turned the form in, and here 
comes some crooked looking clown 
with a sickening I-eat-it-lukewarm 
grin on his face. He just barely 
glanced at the form. I don’t think 
he can read, but he says I’m in.” 

The ambassador stopped the re- 
cording. “It goes on for a good many 
hours. I think what you really want 
to hear is near the end.” He ran the 
molecular ribbon forward at fast 
speed and stopped at a given point. 

The listeners across the street 
heard the voder voice continue. “I 
think I’m at the last stop, now. I 
don’t know why, but something 
screams silently to me. I haven’t 
the slightest idea where I am now, 
but I’d guess we’re out in a Chlorella 
growing area someplace. The stench 
is worse than usual. Tf there’s any 
hidden take-off ' don here, I 
haven’t come across it. 

“Uh, oh. I was just told to sit in 
a chair. Suddenly some clamps 



popped up. I can’t get the 
things loose. The chair’s moving now. 
I’m in a tunnel. Damn — the chair 
suddenly flattened out to form a 
bed. No, it’s more like. Hey, 
it’s more like a doctor’s operating 
table. I don’t like this one little bit. 
Why the Hell didn’t someone give 
me a Panic Button I could press. 
Next time I’ll be damned if I volun- 
teer for anything but an honorable 
discharge and a trip home. 

“By straining my neck I can see 
ahead some. There’s a pretty girl 
on one of these things just ahead of 
me. There’s some kind of machinery 
looming. I think. ... 

“Oh, God, it’s slicing into her! 
These lousy Earthmen aren’t human, 
not human, not . .” The voice 
stopped. 

T he admiral said, “Don’t stop it 
now.” 

“I didn’t. Automatic stop. That’s 
the end. We didn’t know what was 
happening, of course, but we were 
to keep track of our man by trans- 
ponding the recorder. Every so often, 
we’d send out a coded beep and get 
an answer back.” 

The admiral motioned impatient- 
ly. “The crux of the matter, let’s 
get to it, if you please.” 

The ambassador shrugged, turn- 
ing the recorder around and around 
aimlessly on the desk. “We found 
the recorder embedded in a two- 
pound roast in a butcher shop. 
Would you like to know how much 
it cost?” 

“Look, just because you lost a 
man, you don’t have to get flip. I

and all that sort of thing. Just one 
more question: are you sure this 
black market meat business is wide- 
spread enough to account for the

The ambassador nodded. “Yes. 
Since we got the clue we’ve checked 
a lot of places and found this to be 
very common. I was just waiting for 
your arrival to pass the word to the 
staff to stay out of public restaurants. 
We’ll check what we buy locally, and 
we may rely more heavily on im- 
ports.” 

“Yes, I should think you would.

Well, you can order the yacht for 
me, and signal the destroyer to 
stand by at the rendezvous point. 
I’d just as soon get out of here as 
fast as we can. I don’t like the 
place. It stinks.” 

Ambassador Sushi eyed the ad- 
miral, as if trying to read his 
thoughts. He finally asked, “And 
your recommendation. Admiral?” 

The admiral gave a deprecatory 
shrug. “Nothing but a bunch of 
savages. These Earthmen can never 
amount to anything and certainly 
not a major threat. I haven’t found 
any evidence of real intelligence.” 

Across the street, the head of 
Earth’s secret service drew a deep 
breath. Its intensity startled him. He 
realized then just how tense he had 
been. Scarcely able to contain a 
grin, he turned to Joe and said, “I 
was sure worried for a while, let 
me tell you. We would have had 
some scrambling to do if my opinion 
of the Hiroku hadn’t been confirm- 
ed here.” 

Joe said, “Not so bright, eh?” 

The chief knocked out his pipe 
on an ash tray. The pipe had gone 
out unnoticed while half smoked. 
He said, “Well, you have to give

with the thunder. The curving, tem-

outside only the lashing tops of the 
big pines against inky night. Inside 
they regularly drowned the clusters 
of rosy lights and blanched to bone 
the quilted, pearl-gray satin uphol- 
stery. At one end of the oval, the 
silvery, spiral stairway leading up 
to the flat roof and down to the ele- 
vator floor cast momentarily flaring, 
fantastic shadows across the tufted 
floor and the great central bed with 
its huge silk pillows and pearl-gray 
comforter. 

The old lady occupying an edge of 
the bed looked like the bent-waist 
mummy of a girl freshly wrapped 
and hurriedly fitted with a shaggy 
blonde wig and blonde silk night- 
gown. But the brown human claw 



did not tremble, holding the antique- 
inspired, pearl-gray phone greedily 
close to ear and lips, while the 
wrinkle-webbed eye gleamed with the 
lightning and without it, like jewels 
of obsidian or black onyx. 

O LD LADY : Haven’t you got 
the doctor yet, you bitch? 
ANSWERING SERVICE: No, 
madam. He has gone out on an 
emergency case. I am trying to con- 
tact his copter, but the storm is in- 
terfering with short-wave telephony. 

O.L.: I know all about the storm. 
Haven’t you arranged yet for my 
medicine to be delivered, you in- 
competent slut? 

A. S. : No, madam. The copters of 
all regional taxi and delivery serv- 
ices have been grounded by the 
storm. There have been two deaths 
by frightening — excuse me, light- 
ning. I have your Cardinal pills here 
now. If the madam’s phone were

equipped with a matter-reoeiver — 

OL: It isn’t. Stop tormenting me 
by holding those pills just out of 
reach. Haven’t you got the doctor 
yet? 

AS: No, madam. He has gone out 
on an emergency case. I am trying 
to contact his copter, but the 
storm — 

OL; That tape is beginning to bore 
me. You are just a bunch of tapes, 
aren’t you? All very cleverly keyed 
to whatever I say, but still just a 
bunch of tapes. 

AS: No, madam. I am a flesh-and- 
blood woman, age 23, name Doris. 
It’s true, I sometimes think I’m 
just a tape. I’m surrounded by miles 
of them, which do answer routine 
inquiries. Alongside my matter- 
transmitter and keyboard I have a 
tape-writer for punching out more 
tapes. I have a long scissors and 
a pot of cement for editing them. 
But I am truly not a tape myself, 
though once ^ I took a small bottle 
of sleeping pills because I thought 
— No, no, I am a flesh-and-^blood 
woman, age 23 • . 

OL: . name Doris. Yes, I got 
that on the first spin past the 
transmitting head. So now we have 
tapes with biographies, tapes that at- 
tempt suicide and ask for sym- 
pathy, tapes that play on the cus- 
tomer’s feelings. How charming. 
Here I am,- an old woman, all alone 
in a storm, and without a single ser- 
vant, ever since the government with 
its red tape and its oversell of dem- 
ocracy made it po^ible to hire them, 
or even private nurses. An old — 

AS: You haven’t a robot nurse, 
madam? 



OL: Shining horrors! No! I’m just 
an old, old woman, all alone, dying 
for lack of a doctor and medicine, 
but privileged to listen to tapes mak- 
ing excuses. 

AS: Please, madam, I am not — 
OL: Ooooh ... my heart . 
please, nurse, my Cardinal pills . 
please, tape . 

AS: Madam! Madam? 

OL: ... my heart . I’m go- 
ing . ooooh . 

A S: Madam, I’m breaking the 
rules to say this, but if you’re 
having a heart attack, it’s essential 
that you relax, make no effort or 
outcry, waste no strength on — 

OL: Oooh . yes, and tapes to 
help you die quietly, to leave your 
tortured body without making a fuss 
that might embarrass the powers 
that be. Oh, don’t worry, dear tape, 
— and let’s not have any sympathe- 
tic-anxiety spools. I’m over that 
spasm now and merely waiting for 
the next. Just an old woman alone in 
the midst of a dreadful storm — 
hear that crash? — listening to 
tapes and waiting to die for lack 
of one Cardinal pill. 

AS: Madam, a phone of your rat- 
ing should have a matter-receiver. 
Are you quite certain you have not? 
I will inquire of our master files — 
OL: And tapes to make a sales 
pitch while you die. Next you’ll be 
trying to sell me a casket and a 
burial plot, or even um space in 
a tomb satellite. I already have the 
first two of those, thank you. I do 
not have a matter-receiver. 

AS: Madam, I am not trying to 
sell you anything, I am trying to

IF 




save your life. I have your Cardinal 
pills here — 

OL: Stop tantalizing me. 

AS: — and I am doing everytihing 
I can to get them to you. If you had 
a matter-receiver, I would o^y have 
to drop one of the pills in the trans- 
mitter bowl in front of me or punch 
out its codes, and you would have it 
the next microsecond. Well over 99 
percent of all phones of your rating 
have both a matter-receiver and tele- 
kinesis glove. I will inquire — 

OL: Oh yes, a telekinesis glove — 
so I’d be able to sign checks long- 
distance for silver caskets coo\ with 
pearls and orchid plots and pills and 
masses to be said for my soul in 
Chartres, no doubt. But I don’t have 
one, ha-ha, or a matter-receiver ei- 
ther. Who’d swallow a pill that came 
over a wire, all dirty with oil and 
electricity? Oooh . • 

AS: I have programmed an in- 
quiry, madam. It is possible that you 
have a matter-receiver and iaren’t 
aware of it. Please don’t distress or 
in any way exert yourself, madam; 
but I must point out to you that 
actual matter is never transmitted 
over the waves or wires and that, 
in any case, no oil is involved. The 
chemical and mass-shape codes for 
the object are punched into the 
transmitter or analyzed from a sam- 
ple. Only those codes travel over the 
wires or waves. When they reach the 
receiver, they instantly synthesize an 
exact duplicate from standard raw 
materials there. I am oversimplify- 
ing somewhat, but — 

OL: Even tapes to give lectures, 
to contradict and argue with a dying 
customer. Very clever indeed, espe- 



cially when one knows that a com- 
puter, working a tnllkm times as fast 
as a mere hxain, can always out- 
think a human being, even one who 
isn’t dying. 

A S: Madam, I am not a tapd I 
,am a flesh-and-blood .... Oh, 
what’s the use? 

OL: That would have been the 
third running for that one. Is it 
possible that even a computer, even 
a tape has a little shame? Very well, 
my dear, we will pretend you are 
not a tape, but a woman: age 23, 
name Doris. A young woman — it’s 
only bitchy little sexpots that get to 
record those tapes, isn’t it? Or do 
.they concoct them entirely nowadays 
from the squeal of metal and the 
hum of power? Anyhow, we’ll pre- 
tend you’re a beautiful young woman 
who is tormenting me with pills I 
can’t have and with grounded de- 
livery-copters and with doctors who 
have skipped off on emergency visits 
to their mistresses and can’t be reach- 
ed. Yes, ,a beautiful vicious young 
woman, dear tape. At least that will 
give me something definite to hate 
while I die here all alone, someone 
who could conceivably suffer as I 
suffer. Ooooh . 

AS: Madam, I am not beautiful 
and I’m trying hard not to be vicious. 
And I’m quite as alone as you are. 
All alone in a tiny cubical, surroimd- 
ed by yards and yards of electric 
circuits, until my relief turns up. Yet 
I can faintly hear through the air- 
conditioning system the same storm 
you’re having. It’s movipg my way. 

OL: I’m glad you’re all alone. 
I’m glad you can hear the storm. 



ANSWERING SERVICE

I’m glad you’re in a tiny cubical and 
can’t get away. Then you can 
imagine something horrible creeping 
silentlly toward you, as death is creep- 
ing toward me, while you puff your 
cigarettes into the air-conditioning 
outlet and drink your cocktails from 
a flask disguised as a walkie-talkie, 
I imagine, and preen yourself in 
front of a mirror and call one of 
your boy friends and amuse yourself 
by cat-and-mousing an old woman 
dying — 

AS: Stop, mother, please! 

OL: So now I’ve become the 
mother of a tape. How interesting. 
Oh, excuse me, dear, I forgot we’re 
pretending you’re a beautiful young 
woman; but my memory’s not so 
good these last hours, or minutes. 
And besides, it startled me so to 
discover ithat now tapes — excuse 
me again — even have mother fixa- 
tions and have been psychoanalyzed, 
no doubt, and — 

A S: Please, madam, I’m being 
serious. I may not be dying, but 
I wish I were — 

OL: You’re making me feel bet- 
ter, dear. Thank you. 

AS: — so I’m every bit as miser- 
able as you are. I took this job be- 
cause of something that happened 
to me when I was a very little girl. 
My mother had a sudden heart at- 
tack and couldn’t move, and she 
asked me to ^get her medicine. But 
I wouldn’t do it because I’d asked 
her for candy a half hour before 
and she’d refused to give me any, 
and so I refused to move. She al- 
ways called my medicine “candy,” 
and I didn’t understand what was 



happening at all. I thought I was 
just getting even. I didn’t realize she 
was dying. And so long afterwards 
I took this job so I could help other 
people who were in her situation and 
make up for my crime and so I 
could — 

OL: Oh no, my dear, you took 
this job so you could repeat over 
and over with gloating satisfaction 
the hot excitement you got when 
you watched your mother die 
and knew it was you who were kilb 
ing her, so you could go on and on 
and on refusing to give old women 
their medicine or get them doctors, 
meanwhile showering them with 
sticky sweet sympathy, like poison 
for ants, and, not content widi that 
torture, slipping in dirty little pleas 
for sympathy for your own vidous, 
murderous self — 

AS: Oh, stop, stop, stop. I’m hu- 
man! Three point one four one six. 
Pi. One three five seven eleven thir- 
teen. Primes. Two four eight six- 
teen — 

OL: How like a machine. Nothing 
but numbers. Confused with food. 
You’re going crazy, machine. 

AS: Oh, stop, stop, stop! I tell 
you I’m flesh-and-blood — . 

OL: Female, age 23, name Doris. 

AS: — and I’m serious about all 
this, and I know this isn’t the job 
for me at all, because I’m so hor- 
ribly lonely; and what you say about 
me is the way I suspect myself of 
feeling, though I’m trying ,as hard 
as I can to feel the other way, the 
loving way, and I’m afraid — 

OL: I’m glad you can feel guilt. 
Love — don’t make me laugh. But 
I’m glad you’re afraid. Because then

you can imagine something creeping 
toward you as deadly as what’s 
creeping toward me. What if your 
tapes should loop out and strangle 
you? What if your filthy matter- 
transmitter should suck you in and 
spit you out into a red-hot volcano 
or at the north pole or at the bottom 
of the Challanger Deep or on the 
sun side of Mercury? What’s that 
now? — closer than the storm, 
rattling the grill of your ventilation 
inlet? What’s that coming out of the 
answer slot of the computer? Why 
are the needle points of the long 
narrow blades of the scissors swing- 
ing toward you? 

AS: Oh, stop, stop, stop, or they’ll 
jump at my heart! Stop, stop, stop, 
stop, stop — 

OL: Shut up! I’m tired of pre- 
tending. I’m just an old woman dy- 
ing. And you’re just tapes. Yes, just 
tapes. I know that because I’ve been 
insulting you every way I could, 
and you’ve been taking it. A live 
human being wouldn’t. And only a 
tape would call me “madam.” A 
democratized woman — and there 
aren’t any others under 80 — would 



call me dearie or senior citizen. And 
I’ve made you spend an hour on me. 
They’d never let a human being 
waste her working time like that, and 
she wouldn’t care to. But tapes? — 
who cares? Plug the old dame in on 
them and let her play with them 
until she dies! And finally one tape 
got stuck on the word stop and kept 
jerking back and forth there, over 
and over. Ooooh . boooh . 
this is the end, at last . ooooh . 

AS: Stop, stop, STOP! Madam, 
the master files show that your 
phone is equipped with a miniatur-

It’s hidden in the earpiece! I will

I’m dying .

sake.

clatter on the edge of the thick pale 
marble top of the night table. She 
leaned back into the huge pillows. 
Something tiny rattled on the table 
top. She did not look. The phone 
called very faintly with an insect’s 
voice “Madam!” and “Mother!” 
again and again. She did not answer. 

The storm was almost over, the 
lightning gone, the thunder faded; 
but now came a different thunder, a 
muted thunder, a thunder that grew 
and made the old lady frown. It 
drowned the phone’s faint screaming, 
like that of a far«off cicada. 

Something shook the ceiling, then 
jarred it. There was a rapid tattoo 
of footsteps overhead, the creek and 
slam of a door, a clatter of foot- 
steps down the silver stairs. 

Approaching her briskly was a 
slim, middle-aged man carrying a 
black bag and shaking a few water 
drops off his trim gray suit. 

“Well, what’s it this time?” he de- 
manded with a cheery roughness. 
“Used your sleeping pills up too 
fast, I suppose, and then worked 
yourself into a tantrum. I’ll have 
you know I’ve delayed delivering 
the Governor’s daughter’s baby, just

She grinned at him, the tip of her 
nose straining toward the point of 
her chin. 

“The sleeping pills, yes, you 
clever devil. Oh, and I lost my 
temper with your stupid answering 
service.”

In one frantic scramble the old

She began to tremble as the doctor 
was trembling. But her lips were 
smiling, and her eyes glittered like 
jet.

black hole in the center of the pearl-

FANDOM IN EUROPE TODAY 

by LIN CARTER 



Our Mar\ in Fandom looks over 
the swinging European scene! 



W 'ould you believe there are 
science-fiction magazines and 
readers and out-and-out fans all over 
the world, not just here in the U.S.? 
It’s true — science fiction is pub- 
lished and read in Germany, Spain, 
Finland, Great Britain, Italy, France, 
Sweden, Ireland — even in Japan. 
Why, there are even SF enthusiasts 
in Russia, of all places. In fact, I 
understand science fiction is enor- 
mously popular behind the Iron Cur- 
tain . which leads me to suspect 
critics may be right, when they say 
we read the stuff mostly for “es- 
cape.” 

Here in America, we tend to con- 
sider SF to be a homegrown pro- 
duct, fandom then being a local 
phenomenon. This is absolutely not 
the case. While the world’s first sci- 
ence-fiction magazine was American, 
the original pioneers of the stuff were 
French (Jules Verne) and English 
(H.G. Wells), and SF is as much a 
part of the popular culture of 
Europe as it is here. Since science- 
fiction magazines, books and paper- 
backs are published overseas, and 



since we know from American fan 
history that this always seems to 
stimulate a certain small percentage 
of the readership into organizing 
clubs, holding conventions and print- 
ing up fanzines, it’s not surprising 
fandom is a going concern on the 
other side of the Atlantic. Why, 
there’s a science-fiction convention 
in Germany every year — a dozen 
fanzines emerging in Sweden — an 
annual convention in Great Britain 
during the Easter holidays — and a 
booming fan renaissance going on in 
France! 

V/hat do they read? 

Surprisingly enough, the foreign 
fandoms are nurtured on just about 
the same reading matter we enjoy , 
over here. James Blish and Andre 
Norton get published in Denmark 
and Germany. In Italy, a paperback 
series called La Bussola SF does 
A. E. Van Vogt and C. L. Moore. 
Science-fiction readers in France 
read Galaxy (although over tihcre 
they call it Galaxie; and in Germany, 
the edition of Galaxy is n^^ 



59 




Galaxis; it comes out rather spo- 
radically and looks like an AmMi- 
can paperback. 

Science-fiction magazines are pub- 
lished all over. There used to be a 
Swedish edition of Galaxy, and about 
ten years back there was a Finnish 
edition which lasted abput a year. 
There was another Swedish science- 
fiction magazine, a local product 
called Hapna, which has gone under. 
And in Italy and Germany there are 
several local science-fiction maga- 
zines. 

The Fantastic Success of Perry Rhodan 

Germany is the scene of the most 
astonishing fannish movement of all. 
The German fans are so numerous 
and so active, they publish literally 
hundreds of fanzines. This “Gerfan- 
dom” movement (as they call them- 
selves) got started about 1961 or 
thereabouts. And once the ball start- 
ed really rolling, it snowballed into 
such a flurry of activity that Gerfan- 
dom seriously plans to make a bid 
soon to be the site of the Annual 
World SF Convention in 1970 or 
1971. 

An example of the sort of popu- 
larity science fiction enjoys in Ger- 
many can be given in two historic 
words: Perry Rhodan, “Perry” is an 
American astronaut, who, in his 
original magazine appearance, land- 
ed on the moon to discover that an 
alien spaceship was already there. 
(Sounds familiar? I guess they get 
American science-fiction movies over 
there, too!) Anyway, Perry and his 
pals joined up with the aliens for a 
planet-by-planet tour of the Solar 
System that spawned not just two 



or three sequels, but literally 
hundreds. Perry Rhodan (which the 
team of six or seven German writers 
who produce the series by teamwork 
fondly imagine to be a “typical 
American-type name”) has become 
the European answer to Adam Link, 
the Lensmen, Retief, Captain Future 
and the Foundation Series rolled up 
in one big million-word-long ball. 
Today, Perry has worked his way 
through the entire Milky Way 
galaxy and is reportedly about to 
make the big jump into the next 
galaxy! 

Perry and his pals got started, I 
am told, in a German pulp maga- 
zine that came out weekly or bi- 
weekly. As they went on to become 
just about the most fantastically suc- 
cessful phenomenon to arise since 
the happy day when Hugo Gerns- 
back put the two words “science” 
and “fiction” together to make maga- 
zine history, Perry Rhodan outgrew 
the skimpy, confines of his magazine 
to explode all over the newsstands 
in a paperback novel series of in- 
credible size. (I am told there have 
been something like 350 novels about 
Perry and his astronautical chums by 
now . that’s right, three hundred 
and fifty novels! No wonder they 
need seven guys to write the stuff!) 
So voluminous has the Perry Rhodan 
saga become, the German publishers 
are now beginning to reissue the ear- 
lier sixty or seventy novels, for 
those who came in after the curtain 
went up ... 

Incidentally, we Amerifans may 
soon get a look at Perry. Old-time

man, whose wife is currently trans- 
lating some of the Perry Rhodan 
novels into English, is acting as 
Perry’s agent, trying to find an 
American publisher for the super- 
sedes. 

What about books? 

Not only do the foreign fans read 
Galaxy just like we Americans, but 
they have their own Science Fiction 
Book Club, too, although it’s not 
published by Doubleday as is ours. 
In Italy, a publishing house called 
Casa Editrice la Tribuna has a hard- 
cover series of novels and short- 
story collections they issue every 
two months under the title of The 
Science Fiction Book Club. 

The club’s selections consist of 
titles we are pretty familiar with on 
this side of the Atlantic, things like 
Walter M. Miller, Jr.’s A Canticle for 
Leibowitz (forgive me if I don’t try 
to give these titles in their Italian 
form, okay?), Ray Bradbury’s A 
Medicine for Melancholy, Kurt Von- 
negut’s Player Piano, Philip Jose 
Farmer’s The Lovers, and other stuff 
by Clifford D. Simak and compar- 
able writers. 

In England, of course, a very large 
number of American writers are pub- 
lished in hardcover reprints. Eng- 
land also has its own science-fiction 
book club (called The Science Fic- 
tion Book Club and published by 
Phoenix House, Ltd.). 

England has had many science- 
fiction magazines come and go. For 
many years a local product, ScU 
ence Fantasy, dominated the SF 
scene and discovered and developed 
whole generations of writers (one of 



their last major discoveries was J.G. 
Ballard). 

Science Fantasy changed its name 
to Impulse and went under finally, 
after a long and rather glorious his- 
tory. Then a bunch of British fans 
got together and produced a fan- 
operated but newsstand-distributed 
professional SF mag called Alien 
World, which did not manage to 
survive very long. Today, there is 
only one prozine surviving, and 
that’s New Worlds, which has re- 
cently produced its 171 st consecu- 
tive issue. Even imder the imagina- 
tive editorship of the popular young 
writer Michael Moorcock, whose 
work has been appearing over here 
in paperback recently, New Worlds 
began getting a bit wobbly in the 
sales figures. Happily for British fan- 
dom, a British Arts Council subsidy 
arrived in time to save this vener- 
able and excellent title from extinc- 
tion. 

Elsewhere, things are looking up. 
In Italy these days, a brand new 
science-fiction magazine is starting 
up under the title of Nova SF. It 
contains, or will contain since I’m 
not certain just when the venture 
wUl be launched, a selection of 
stories translated from English, plus 
reviews and critical essays and the 
like. JVbvfl SF has an Advisory Board 
made up of experts well known on 
both sides of the Atlantic — people 
like Brian Aldiss and Don WoUheim. 
This new magazine will not appear 
on the newsstands, but will be sold 
through the mails by subscription 
only. This move spares the publishers 
a lot of worry about distributors and 
newsstand display and so on.

Incidentally, in Italy, due to the 
peculiarities of the Italian language, 
“SF” is known as “FS” since the 
pbarse when j:endered into that lingo 
comes out something like fantascien- 
za. Meanwhile, in Germany, the 
common term for science fiction is 
futur-romanz. Great Ghu only knows 
what k is in Japanese! Yes, there is 
at least one professional science-fic- 
tion magazine in Japan, and it’s the 
Japanese edition of Galaxy. I won’t 
try to reproduce the title of the maga- 
zine here, as our trusty typesetters 
might go through the roof if I asked 
them to dig up typeface in the Japa- 
nese characters! 

TAFF 

Do foreign fans ever visit fan 
conventions in the United States? 
Yes, they do; for about ten years or 
so there has been a Nice Ttog go- 
ing called T.A.F.F. The name means 
“Trans-Atlantic Fan Fund.” Fans on 
both sides of the ocean get together 
and raise a sizable sum of money, 
five hundred dollars, maybe as 
much as a thousand dollars, and 
give it to a popular American fan 
so he can afford to visit a convention 
overseas — or to a popular foreign 
fan, so he can come to an American 
convention. 

For instance, back in 1962, fans 
around the world donated their dol- 
lars, pounds, francs and pfennigs to 
bring Walt Willis all the^way from 
Belfast, Ireland, to the 1962 World 
Science Fiction Convention which 
was held that year in Chicago, 
Illinois. More recently, in 1965 the 
T.A.F.F. money went to an Ameri- 
can fan named Terry Carr, and with 



it he and his wife traveled to the 
World Con in London, England. 

Last year, it was a fan from Ger- 
many. Tom Schluck of Hanover, 
West Germany, one of the most ac- 
tive and popular fans in Europe 
came to visit the 1966 Con in Cleve- 
land. Tom, who is a young fellow 
in his twenties works in a German 
bank and (since he is fluent in both 
languages) moonlights by translating 
American science fiction into Ger- 
man for the German SF magazines. 

Fans are nominated to run for 
election, which is how one gets 
selected for T.A.F.F. This happens 
every year. To vote for the fan of 
your choice, you send in a dollar or 
more, which is added to the central 
fimd. Also, World Conventions do- 
nate surplus funds to T.A.F.F., and 
I understand that it’s not unheard 
of for one of the science-fiction 
magazines to donate a modest 
sum to this pleasant cause. Not too 
many people in fandom can afford 
the travel expenses one incurs in a 
transatlantic flight to another coun- 
try. And since lots of fans in other 
countries felt left out of things, a 
number of American fans over the 
years (starting with a Florida boy 
named Shelby Vick) began urging 
the idea into actuality. 

Next month, we’ll take a close- 
up look at what goes on in the an- 
nual British and German conventions 
. maybe take an advance look at 
German fandom’s plans for a World 
Convention . and compare some

IF 





WHEN SEA ^ 
IS BORN AGAIN 



by C. C. MacAPP 



Illustrated by 



Sea owned the planet. And in 
its rages of rebirth. Sea came 
close to destroying it entirely! 



I 

I n Tenabur Wood the bregfern 
grows tall and dusky-green be- 
neath a brooding canopy of plillom 
trees. Especially along Nottan River, 
where the canopy 'grudgingly lets 
in a few startling shafts of ruddy 
sunlight, the breg is thick. It so 
smothers the dank ground that two 
furtive creatures might huddle with- 



in a leap, each invisible to the 
other. 

It was there that Latpur — ap- 
prentice to the Prognosticator 
Deeoon — crouched, his ears erect 
and cupped forward, his dull-blue 
nostrils atwitch for any scent that 
might penetrate to him, his tri- 
taioned paws digging into the cool 
black mud. 

Again, faint sounds reached him. 



63 



He was sure, this time, that they 
came from across the river. He 
hesitated a moment longer, senses 
astrain for any hint of nearer danger. 
Then he crept forward, parting the 
breg carefully with a forepaw until 
he could peer out. 

He released his breath in a noise- 
less sigh. The strange vroal on the 
little sandstrip opposite could only 
be the itinerant shaman Gultaz of 
whom Deeoon had been muttering 
lately. 

The interloper was indeed of a 
different race of vroal. Where Lat- 
pur’s own fur was dull gray, this 
other’s was olive-green, a hit lighter 
than the bregfern. He wasn’t really 
a giant. He’d be little heavier than 
plump old Deeoon, but his feet and 
forepaws were large, his snout big, 
his active dark eyes sunk under a 
heavy brow. His accoutrements were 
odd, too. 

Instead of a simple cinch like 
Latpur’s, he wore* a wide, ornate 
belt of painted leather, festooned 
with a weird assortment of objects 
— a thigh-bone of some small ani- 
mal, inlaid with glittering metal; a 
silvery mirror-disk with two holes in 
it; a small flute made of bone or 
horn; three or four skewers or awls 
that looked like hard metal. The 
only weapon was a knife with a bone 
handle, more intricately carved than 
Latpur’s but not essentially different. 
There might be other weapons, or 
Sea knew what oddities, in the yoke- 
pack on the sand. 

A shrill cry made Latpur go 
tense. A green-and-yellow bird 
flashed through a shaft of sunlight, 
whirled out in two quick circles over 



the water, then shot toward Gultaz. 
The foreign shaman lifted a forepaw. 
Evidently he held grain or something 
in it, for the bird lit on his wrist 
and began to peck. Gultaz stood as 
if waiting. Moments later another 
bird swooped into sight from down- 
stream and joined its fellow on the 
shaman’s wrist. 

Gultaz clucked softly, let the 
birds feed a moment, then tossed 
them into the air to settle on a tree- 
branch. Whatever he might possess 
in the way of magic, he obviously 
didn’t rely on it to guard him. 
Those birds clearly scouted like 
tchinni^irds. 

Now Gultaz was removing his belt, 
laying it carefully atop the yokepack 
and eyeing the river in a practiced 
way. Before wading in, he got down 
to all fours, lowered his head, im- 
mersed one ear and cupped a paw 
over the other. Then, satisfied, he 
entered the water silently. 

There was no air of joy about 
the bathing. Instead, it was dutiful 
and perhaps ritual. Also, Gultaz 
tasted the water carefully. 

The shaman’s attention to the river 
goaded Latpur’s uneasiness. He stay- 
ed long enough to watch Gultaz 
emerge, shake himself, don the belt 
and yokepack and slip into the ferns. 
The bright birds — silent now — 
flitted watchfully ahead. Then Latpur 
crept from the fempatoh. Seeking 
the most open stretches of the wood, 
he went stealthily on hind legs, senses 
alert, imtil he reached open ground. 
Then, on all fours, he loped up the 
sunny grassland toward the quartz- 
crowned hill where he and Deeoon 
lived. 



64 



IF 




T he plump, graying Prognosticator 
let his sharp eyes sweep over 
Latpur before he grunted, “Well, 
why the haste?” 

“Reason enough, gruol I saw the 
foreign shaman! He wore a belt hung 
with strange mystic devices. He had 
two gaudy birds that flew as scouts. 
He bathed with odd gestures and 
tasted the water repeatedly.” Latpur 
paused for breath. “Will you tell me, 
gruo, how you knew he’d be coming 
and where I should watch?” 

Deeoon made a sign of impati- 
ence. “I told you he followed Sea, 
and Sea has been showing signs of 
interest in Nottan River lately. 
Naturally I progged he’d come. He 
was here before, even though Sea’s 
interest then didn’t come to any- 
thing.” 

“Oh,” Latpur said. “And naturally 
you remembered where he bathed 
before.” 

Deeoon lowered his brow in 
amusement. “Of course. But that 
wasn’t where I had you watch. I 
progged he’d avoid the old spot out 
of elementary caution. I chose the 
only other one with the right ap- 
proaches and river currents for his 
purpose.” 

“Well,” Latpur said, “he didn’t 
seem to taste anything that was par- 
ticularly significant.” 

Deeoon gestured toward a small 
bowl of clear quartz, half full of 
purplish liquid, with a flat cover 
over it. “That’s the sample of lower- 
river water you got yesterday. Re- 
agents show nothing unusual yet. 
Eat, and rest yourself. Tomorrow I 
send you on an overnight mission. 
Go down to rivermouth and fetch me 



samples of the sea, on both siQc«, 
and pouches of sand as well. Also 
samples of eddy-water from the 
river, below the great rock. Don’t 
take any risky short-cuts; there’s no 
immediate urgency. Go via farm- 
land. While you’re there, climb the 
rock and look southward to see if 
the aliens who say they’re from an- 
other world are still in the same 
place. If they are, trot down and 
warn them that Sea will probably 
spawn in Nottan River less than ten 
days from now. Tell them they’d 
better move.” 

“Yes, gruo.” 

“And on the way back, stop at 
Village, Wemm and try to collect the 
fee they still owe us. If they won’t 
pay ail, get what you can. Tell them 
I’m peeved.” 

Latpur said, “Shall I not also 
warn them about the Spawning?” 
Deeoon sighed. “I prog it won’t 
be necessary. Gultaz will already 
have put a scare into them, some 
way or other.” 

Latpur turned toward the food 
niche, then paused. “Is he as evil as 
he looks?” 

“Evil enough. My last-but-one ap- 
prentice ran afoul of him and disap- 
peared. You be cautious. At least 
he’ll want to sell the people charms 
and spells, and gouge whatever he 
can. He won’t want you around 
talking sense to them.” 

Latpur said disgustedly, “Super- 
stitious root-diggers!” 

Deeoon frowned. “When you’ve 
been a Prognosticator as long as I 
have, you’ll be less certain what’s 
superstition and what’s sound in- 
stinct.” 



WHEN SEA IS BORN AGAIN 



65 




n 

N ext morning’s sun was golden- 
led and already warm on the 
rolling lands through which Latpur 
cantered. One of his tchinni rode 
on his head (the part of him that 
bounced least) while the other flew 
a zigzag path in advance. 

Once, the scouting bird shrilled 
an alert and swooped beyond a 
ridge. When Latpur topped the ridge 
cautiously the bird was far down 
the other slope, circling over a 
glond, a huge old male Latpur 
recognized by a scar on one orange- 
brown flank. He judged, from the 
leisurely way it trotted, that it was 
returning to its lair after a success- 
ful night’s hunt, which meant it 
wasn’t dangerous at the moment if 
he kept his distance. It was ignor- 
ing the swift bird above it. Latpur 
watched it quicken pace on more 
level ground, its great leg-muscles 
bunching, then pause just at the edge 
of the brush bordering Tenabur 
Wood to lift its big head and sniff 
the air. For a moment it turned and 
peered up toward him, knowing, no 
doubt, where to look for the bird’s 
owner. Then it stalked into the 
brush. 

Latpur stayed a moment, fixing 
every detail in his mind. There was 
never any telling what seemingly in- 
significant -thing might hold mean- 
ing for Deeoon. He turned and 
scanned the country ahead. 

Off to the left of his route, a 
dozen local vroal were walking up- 
lift toward a tuber-patch, spades 
on their shoulders. He started that 
way, and presently his second 



tchinni let out a chirp, rose and 
circled once, then shot off toward 
the group, doubtless to renew ac- 
quaintances with others of its kind. 

To his surprise, when the farmers 
spotted him they laid down their 
digging-tools and came loping on all 
fours to meet him. Before they 
were even close, one called out, 
“Hoy! Apprentice! What news of 
Sea?” 

Latpur sighed. When they used 
the word like that, they meant Sea- 
entity, not simply the sea. So they 
already had warning. He said un- 
oertaidy, “I’m going down to get 
samples of water and sand right 
now. Deeoon thinks — ” 

The spokesman scowled. “Your 
gruo’s too damned cagey with what 
he th inks , land what he says. Last 
night a young she of my 'klatch was 
bespelled so that she wandered in 
the dark alone for hours on Loo- 
chiss Creek. What’s more, her 
tchinni abandoned her and flew 
home, acting demented. And what’s 
still more, a glond stalked her — 
then, face4o-face, within springing- 
distance, suddenly snarled in fear 
and backed away!” 

Latpur stared, trying to overcome 
his prickling of fear. It was hard to 
ignore the old tales and legends. 
Finally he said, “If she was crazed, 
she could imagine anything. Anyway, 
I don’t — what reason is there to 
talk about Sea being involved or 
about bewitchment?” 

“Ha!” the farmer snorted. “You’ve 
absorbed so much of Deeoon’s non- 
sense you talk like him. I think I’ll 
take this she to Deeoon and let him 
explain the marks around her neck!

The fur singed away, as if by a red- 
hot necklace! You’ve heard of Sea’s 
necklaces! What do you say to that?” 
Latpur gaped for a iminute, mus- 
tered himself and said with more 
firmness than he felt, *‘I say I must 
be on about my errands, so that 
Deeoon can assess things and give 
you sound advice. Good digging to 
you, farmers.” He loped away, try- 
ing to look confident. An outbreak 
of superstition was always bad for a 
Prognosticator and his apprentices. 
In such times, he brooded, it might 
almost be wise to be a shaman, 
whether you believed in magic or not. 

He was out of sight before he re- 
alized he’d neglected to ask questions 
or even observe such details as the 
condition of the farmers’ persons, 
belts and tools. Deeoon would be 
angry with him. He stopped, half in- 
clined to go back, but couldn’t bring 
himself to it. And anyway, his mind 
was beginning to work. Maybe — 
magic or not — the interloper Gultaz 
bad something to do with their 
strange story. 

F rom the pinnacle of the great 
rock around which Nottan 
River swerved, the sea looked calm 
enough. The boom and crash of the 
surf was only a mutter, up here. It 
was old, he thought, how water so 
deeply purple could become delicate 
turquoise in the shallows or turn to 
foam as dazzling-white as the sand. 
He watched the crisscross wave pat- 
terns that made the brackish mouth 
of Nottan River look like some shift- 
ing, living, woven fabric. He could 
almost imagine that the sea was alive 
all the time. 



Near that brackish mouth, the 
sand was green with algae. 
river itself was tinged, too — he 
could easily distinguish the eddies 
where the water was just mixed 
enough to support the al^ie. Fish 
would be darting there. 

He looked about car^utty, nothig 
how the few clouds moved and hew 
the sea birds wheeled within certain 
updrafts or dove at schools of emafl 
fish beyond the surf. He must de- 
scribe everything accurately to Dec- 
oon. He studied the beaek below 
him. Was there a slight mounding 
on each side of the river mouth? It 
was hard <to remember ^actly hew 
things had looked on his last visit. 
With practice, Deeoon said, he*d he 
able to recall vividly. 

He turned and looked eoulhwecd 
again at the strange metal cyUnder, 
dwarfed by distance, an hour’s tmt 
down the beach. His heart quicken- 
ed. Of all ithe ages, to be bom in 
this one that saw visitors from an- 
other world! And if, also, he were 
privileged to witness a Spawning .... 

A Spawning hadn’t occurred in this 
part of the world for many genera- 
tions. His grandfather had made a 
long trip once and seen the dev- 
astation left by one. That, in fact, 
was how Latpur came to be 
Deeoon’s ptesent apprentice — 
Deeoon had promised such, in return 
for the grandfather’s first-hand de- 
scriptions. 

He clucked to his tcbimii and 
started down from the rock. He’d 
collect his sample first, then lope 
down to the alien ship. Probabfy 
they’d let him sleep the night deee 
to the great bull lor safety. 



WHEN SEA IS BORN AGAIN 



67 




T he alien called Meecham^ the 
specialist studying vroal laji- 
guage, came out of the ship to meet 
him. Meecham’s voctbulairy was 
small, but his accent was good. As 
usual, he wore at his waist the litde 
box that could listen and mimic back 
perfectly. “I bid welcome. Why does 
Prognosticator Latpur honor us with 
this visit?” 

Latpur said dutifully, “Pm only 
an apprentice. Deeoon wants me to 
warn you of a rare and terrible 
event. The sea will come alive and 
spawn in Nottan River within the 
next few days! It would be wise for 
you to move a few hundred miles 
away.” 

The alien looked at him for a mo- 
ment. ‘We thank you and your gruo 
for the warning. But we have — ” he 
searched for a word — “devices 
planted -around here that we must 
watch. And it’s a le^igthy process 
to get the ship ready to lift.” 

Latpur shifted from one hind foot 
to Ihc other. “I’m afraid you don’t 
understand. A spawning is a deadly 
thing! And Sea might he angry that 
you are here. It would be very fool- 
ish not to move.” 

Meecham bobbed his head gravely. 
‘We thank you for your concern. I 
will tell our captain. But tell me, 
please — What life form is it that 
will sp'awn? A fish of some kind?” 
“No, no! Sea! The sea-entity, that 
only com^ alive once in six years 
anywhere in the world!” 

Meecham bobbed his head again. 
“You’ve spoken of a sea-entity be- 
fore. Have you seen it yourself?” 
“No,” Latpur said a little im- 
patiently. “I have ttot.” 

6t 



“Then, have you talked with any- 
one who has?” 

“No. But it’s a real thing! Not — 
not superstition. Deeoon t hinks 
there’s no magic at all. You must 
not doubt me! Do you not have a 
sea on your own world?” 

“We have several, and many things 
in them that spawn, but none that 
are very dangerous. Can you tell me 
what the danger is?” 

Latpur wrestled with his own 
vague conceptions. “There are mani- 
festations that sting, and poisons, 
and burning necklaces . and . 
and all manner of things that ap- 
pear. Whole regions are stripped of 
foliage, and almost all animals of 
any size arc killed and eaten. My 
own grandfather saw a region that 
had been devastated.” 

Mcediam said yet again, ‘We are 
grateful for the warning. Our cap- 
tain will study it and decide. It may 
be that we can defend ourselves 
here. Please do not think us unre- 
sponsive. As strangers here, we must 
think carefully before making de- 
cisions. Now, if you have time, may 
I introduce my little girl to you? I 
promised her I would, next time you 
came.” 

Latpur, hiding his impatience, 
agreed, accepted the alien’s request 
that he wait and watched the alien 
climb rungs and work the handle of 
a door. So they still weren’t going to 
invite him into the ship. They spoke 
of germs and study and said mean- 
while he’d better not enter, partly 
for his own protection. He hadn’t 
missed Meecham’s honesty in saying 
“partly,” and Deeoon had chuckled 
over his account. 

IF 




M eecham returned with the she- 
child. Latpur was surprised she 
was so like the adults, except for 
size. She was hardly a third Mee- 
cham’s height and had pale hair 
though his was dark, but her limbs 
and torso and features differed only 
slightly in proportion. 

Meecham herded her forward. 
“Latpur, this is Laurie.” He spoke 
to her in the alien tongue. She hung 
back, edging timidly behind her 
father and whispering to him. She 
called him “Daddy.” Her eyes were 
wide with fright. She had an alien- 
doll that she dutched to herself 
tightly. 

Meecham laughed. “Please excuse 
her. This is her first sight of an — 
of one of you.” He explained more 
seriously, “You see, her mother — 
my mate — died less than a year ago. 
That’s wihy I brought Laurie on this 
trip with me.” 

“Oh,” Latpur said awkardly. “I’m 
very sorry.” 

Meecham murmured an acknowl- 
edgement, then seemed to listen to 
the talking-plug in one ear. He 
looked up at Latpur. “Our captain 
says he’s sorry he’s not here to 
greet you. He’s away in the flying- 
cart. He asks that I make some sort 
of gift as a sign of friendship.” 
Meecham looked thougjitful. “Will 
you excuse us for a moment?” He 
let the child scamper ahead of him. 

Latpur waited, eyes roving the 
area. One of his tchinni winged by, 
swerving around the alien ship, and 
scouted the beach beyond. 

There was a concentration of sea 
birds, far out. On the wet sand near 
him, a few small life forms crawled. 



The smells were normal — the sea- 
smell, the smells of the beach and; 
from the bordering brusldand, the 
musky-leafy-loamy-animat complex. 
Very faintly on the north breeze 
came the dank smell of Tenabur 
Wood, touched with the spice of plil- 
lom leaves. Was it possible life and 
foliage? He shuddered. 

Meecham returned alone, with a 
small stoppered vial holding many 
little strips of the stuff the aliens 
called “paper.” “This is something 
you and Deeoon can use. You said 
you know about acids and bases.” 

“Yes,” Latpur said. The aliens 
had been astounded at his acquain- 
tance with chemistry - — a thing, of 
course, that any Prognosticator need- 
ed. 

“Well,” Meecham said, “this paper 
will change color to show different 
strengths of acid or base. By trying 
known solutions, you can learn which 
color represents what. It isn’t magic. 
It’s science.” 

Latpur, intrigued, made the head- 
bow of gratitude. “I thank you! I 
have nothing at the moment to give 
in return, but — ” 

The alien held up a hand. “You’ve 
just given us an important warning. 
We are in your debt.” He waited for 
Latpur to say something. 

Latpur stirred with anger. Be- 
hind the alien’s polite words was dis- 
belief; even irony, perhaps. He al- 
most handed back the gift. But 
Deeoon would not want him to do 
that. He hesitated. He didn’t feel, 
now, like asking permission to sleep 
near the ship. “I must be going,” 
he said formally. “I’ve been honored 
to talk again.” 



WHEN SEA IS BORN AGAIN 



69 




The honor is ours,** said Mee- 

m 

L atpur cantered back to tha great 
rock and climbed to a ledge 
where glonds or other large predators 
couldn’t reach him. He chose the 
smoothest spot for a bed. He took 
some roasted tubers from his yoke- 
pack, crumbled part of one for his 
tchinni and munched the rest, along 
with strips of cooked and dried meat. 
The sun was setting, out of his sight. 
The rock’s huge shadow stretched 
out over the sea which was now a 
very deep purple. The distant mutter 
of surf was punctuated by the cries 
of late-feeding sea birds. There was 
a line of clouds on the horizon. 

He wondered if a storm would 
overtake him before he got home. 
An ordinary storm he didn’t fear, 
but Sea might ride the clouds now. 
It was strange, he thought, how 
mixed his feelings were. Within a 
few short days, the stable world was 
overturned. First, the aliens, with 
the stunning news that there were 
other worlds — not half-^believed 
paradises and purgatories, but solid 
worlds, with mountains and forests 
and rivers and seas and creatures, 
all strange! And the aliens’ sciences, 
what he’d seen of them — making 
him realize how primitive even 
Decoon’s knowledge was. Though, of 
course, the old Prognosticator made 
marvelous use of it. And now the 
Spawning — a dread, mystic thing 
that, a few days ago, had been no 
more in his mind than the other side 
of the world. 



The Stan were out now. He stared 
up at them until his neck ached* 
From which did the aliens come? 
He wondered if Sea knew about the 
stars. Somehow, they now seemed 
to glare down balefully. 

He growled to himself. He was 
beginning to think like a superstitious 
farmer. Determinedly, he curled up 
to sleep. He did sleep, but all night 
he kept coming awake; trembling, 
vague furtive dreams in his mind, 
to lie and listen to the unresting 
surf. And, some time after oudnight, 
another sound wrenched him awake 
— a keening somewhere on the river, 
as of some animal in pain. It was 
too high-pitched to be a gload. His 
tchinni stirred and twittered un- 
easily. 

Somehow he endured until anona- 
ing and, after a tasteless breakfast 
and a thorough scan around, des- 
cended from the ledge and started 
home .... 

The small settlement of Wemm 
was on the V of land where Loochiss 
Creek joined Nottan River. Most of 
the males and some of the females 
were out gathering tubers and nuts 
and grains, but the old mayor was at 
home. 

The grizzle-pelted elder scowled 
at Latpur. “And why should we pay 
fees to a Prognosticator who docs not 
warn us of the most fearful events 
of our lifetimes?’’ 

Latpur said, “In due course ay 
griio will give you exact predictions 
and advice. He doesn’t go about 
peddling vague guesses. In any case, 
you owe us for advice on the spring 
planting. Your crops have been OR- 
cellent.” 



WHEN SEA IS BORN AGAIN 



71 




The elder scowled more deeply, 
and fingered a curious charm he 
wore on a thong around his neck 
— a painted wooden disk, orange 
with three horizontal bars of green. 
‘T can’t pay you the entire sum now; 
we’ve had other expenses. You’ll 
have to be content with one-third 
for the moment.” 

Latpur made a polite gesture. 
“May I have it, then?” Only after 
the elder had hobbled to a strong 
wooden cask and taken out six small 
bars of silver did Latpur say, “There 
is a false shaman about, a foreigner, 
who’ll be trying to peddle chaims. 
Don’t be fooled. They are useless.” 
He pretended not to notice ho\y 
guiltily the mayor’s gnarled talons 
let go of the amulet. He made a 
bow. “Good health to you. Elder.” 

D eeoon was tired and testy from 
two days of circulating among 
clients, but he brightened when Lat- 
pur gave him the aliens’ gift and 
explained its use. “Splendid! Splen- 
did! It will save reagents and work. 
A timely thing, too. We’ll be short 
of funds, as I had no better luck than 
you in collecting fees. Come, let’s 
get to work on those samples.” 

First of all, he put a sample of 
rivermouth sand into a bowl, added 
distilled water, stirred and filtered 
off the liquid into a clear beaker. A 
slightly milky reagent went in, 
twenty-five drops or so; then two 
drops of a deep blue solution. Dee- 
oon stirred with a fire-drawn rod of 
quartz. For a moment the mixture 
remained blue. Then, swiftly, it be- 
gan to fade. 

“Ah!” exclaimed Deeoon, “It’s 



farther along than I thought!” Lat- 
pur watched with excitement as the 
mixture turned light lavender, then 
pink, and finally colorless. l>eeooa 
picked up the beaker, sniffed at it 
and sighed. “There’s a strange odor 
but it means nothing to me. If only 
we had more reliable pamphlets .... 
Well, anyway, we’ll see an onset 
within four days!” He turned to get 
another sample. 

Latpur said, “There was a happen- 
ing, gruo.” He told what he’d heard 
from the first group of farmers. 

Deeoon’s face darkened. “The 
work of Gultaz, of course. There are 
drugs that can induce a kind of walk- 
ing sleep, in which the victim will 
carry out orders, and later forget. 
It’s a small chore, of course, to be- 
wilder tchinni. For one thing, a cer- 
tain kind of whistle, inaudible to us, 
will do it. Don’t you recall that, from 
the pamphlet by Klazzar? And a 
certain unguent will repel glonds. 
Don’t underestimate Gultaz’s arts. 
Our need is to prog how he may 
move against us. He knows we’ll 
try to discredit him.” Deeoon turned 
back to his beakers. “Let’s 
see, now . .” 

T wo hours later the samples were 
all tested. Deeoon said, “A pat- 
tern emerges. This will be a great 
Spawning — as vast as the one that 
devastated Soolban, where your 
grandfather traveled. I prog a series 
of dams in Nottan River for fifty 
miles inland — perhaps even above 
Tenahur Wood entirely. Foraging 
will reach up all the tributaries and 
across the grasslands. But if the 
pamphlets are accurate it will not

IF 




assail the higher hills or the moun- 
tains. The reason for that is simple: 
the basin itself is rich, and at this 
time of the year, which is a little 
late for a Spawning, it will be a hur- 
ried event, rather than a leisurely 
one with foraging farther from the 
river. You and 1 can spend tomor- 
row telling the popnilation where to 
flee. Then we’ll leave for a high 
place I know where we can watch 
the lowlands without being intoler- 
ably endangered.” 

Latpur’s pulse pounded. “Would 
you approve, my gruo, my staying 
here as an on-the-spot observer?” 
Deeoon jerked his head around to 
stare. “Do you realize your chances, 
if you tried staying?” 

Latpur said excitedly, “You told 
me once there were precautions that 
sometimes help. And a few creatures 
do survive, don’t they? What about 
Gultaz? He seems unworriedl” 
Deeoon scowled. “Of course! He 
has, the story goes, some redolent 
salve that protects him from Sea’s 
foragers. But I have no hint of how 
he makes it.” 

Latpur squirmed his weight 
around; finally got to his feet. 
“There’s one way to get some — 
steal it from him!” 

Deeoon grimaced. “Do you sup- 
pose others haven’t tried? One of his 
arts is compelling beasts to guard 
his camps. I prog your chances at 
less than one in a thousand!” 

Latpur insisted hotly, “We’re not 
artless ourselves! If there’s an in- 
audible whistle to bewilder tohinim, 
it may work against his birds too! 
And you said there’s a glend repel- 
lant. Can you make some?” 



Deeoon blinked. “Why, I have 
some, somewhere about. But it’s 
never been given a good test.” 
Latpur found himself grinning. 
“T/iis will be a good test. You know 
as well as 1 do, that old glond 
keeps other predators away from that 
part of the river.” He watch- 
ed Deeoon anxiously. “There’s an- 
other thin-g on my mind, gruo. If 
the aliens stay, they may try to fight 
Sea. And that would be something 
to witness!” 

Deeoon blinked again, then sud- 
denly lowered his brow in amuse- 
ment. ‘Try, then, for Gultaz’s un- 
guent! Day after tomorrow — we 
must send the farmers away, tomor- 
row. And if you get the unguent, 
I’ll stay too! Even if you fail, we 
can shut ourselves up in a cave 
at the last minute and hope we’re 
not rooted out!” 

IV 

L atpur swam Nottan River, 
queasily, in the upper fringes of 
Teoabur Wood, miles above where 
he’d seen Gultaz. Across, he took off 
his yokepack and drained it, shook 
himself, applied glond repellent and 
started downstream. He felt nervous 
going down the gloomy north bank. 
He kept imagining stealthy sounds in 
the hreg. He was travelling without 
his tohinni, as their presence might 
betray him. On a thong around his 
neck was the whistle Deeoon had 
made. To his nostrils, the glond re- 
pellent he wore smelled burnt and 
caustic and drowned out other 
smells. 

Ahead of him, something big 

73 



WHEN SEA IS BORN AGAIN 




crashed through the breg and plung- 
ed int« the water. An amphibian. He 
croudhed, trying to sniff the breeze, 
whioh was behind him — an eddity, 
since he faced seaward — but the 
glond repellent overpowered every- 
thing. 

An orange and green bird, doubt- 
less attracted by the amphibian’s dive, 
flashed overhead. Should he use 
the whistle? Erratic behavior of the 
watchbird could alert Gultaz. He hesi- 
tated, the whistle in his mouth. The 
wings suddenly whirred directly over 
him. Startled, he blew hard. He 
heard netSiing except a hiss of air, 
but his lips itingled. Somewhere the 
bird shii^ed and beat its wings 
violently. He heard its distracted 
cries fading down-river. He’d been 
too impulsive! He pusihed farther 
from the stream, as hastily as he 
dared. He must circle and approach 
the foreigner’s camp below, at least 
having the breeze right. If Gultaz 
came looking, he would find his 
trail. But the shaman would move 
cautiously, and there might be 
time .... 

He blundered into a game trail, 
crouched, then bounded down it in 
short careful leaps. He could hear 
nothing except his own pulse and his 
faint footfalls, smell nothing but the 
unguent. The trail wound on and 
on. Now and then small creatures 
leaped away 'before him. 

Finally the trail dipped toward 
the river. He paused. Had he come 
far enough? He thought so. He 
left the trail and angled back up- 
stream. 

There was a sound from his left. 
He cowered, listening, Then, even 



above the stink of the unguent, he 
smelled glond. 

His muscles bunched, but he 
didn’t move. No vroal could outrun 
a glond, even the old one that 
haunted this region. And the nearest 
tree trunk was twenty feet away. If 
the unguent didn’t work .... the 
rustling came closer. Then the move- 
ment stopped, and he heard the 
glond snarl in frustrated anger. The 
repellent did work! 

But a shrill bird-call sounded 
from upstream. Gultaz, returning! 

Laitpur leaped away, heedless of 
everything but flight. He had no de- 
sire to face Gultaz here. He heard 
the glond start after him. He reach- 
ed the bank and dove, remembering 
in mid4eap his new uneasiness 
about the water, struck it, swam 
desperateily underwater, downstream 
and across. Would Gultaz have river 
creatures patrolling? A shaman who 
could lure a glond to guard his 
camp .... 

One of the watohbirds was circling 
over him when he surfaced to gasp 
for air. A quick glance back showed 
no sign of Gultaz yet. He was out 
of effective dart or arrow range now, 
so he swam on the surface; reached 
the south bank; clambered up. Some 
missile plunged into the breg near 
him, 'but he didn’t pause. He shoved 
through at full tilt to drier and less 
fern-choked ground; galloped hard 
downriver. Shame was rising within 
him. His attempt 'had been one un- 
planned succession of impulses and 
pani'cs. He could just as well have 
gotten downwind in the first place 
and scouted more carefully, not 
drowning his sense of smell with the 

IF 



74 




repellent until he needed it. Deeoon 
would be disgusted. 

He stepped to catch his breath 
and assess things. His yokepack was 
still dripping water, which annoyed 
him. His rations must be soaked. 
He peered eastward, as if that would 
help him visualize the sea. How 
much chpange would there be now? 
Deeoon had warned him that, if he 
had no luck against Gultaz, it might 
already be dangerous to go down- 
river. Still, there was no sign of 
anything strange yet. And this might 
be the last chance to look and to 
get new samples. 

He started on, seeking out a game 
trail he remembered, taking up a 
steady lope that devoured the miles. 

He hoped the old glond was still 
on the other side of the river. The 
escaping swim had washed off all the 
repellent. 

H e stood at the base of the great 
rock, staring at the river mouth. 
Thick dikes were mounded up of 
sand, seaweed, shells, bones — whole 
skeletons, here and there, of mighty 
sea creatures. They pushed the river 
into a narrow channel, where it ran 
swift and turbulent. Surf — more 
violent than he’d ever seen — 
periodically beat back even that cur- 
rent. As the surf bore in, it seemed to 
focus itself up the narrow channel, 
and each wave deposited some layer 
of solid matter. The dikes were clos- 
ing together before his eyes! 

He forced himself on down to fill 
his sample vials, then walked up 
the river as far as the rock. Already 
the water level was two or three feet 
above normal. A pool was forming. 



Standing there, he must have 
heard or smelled something, for sud- 
denly he was aware of danger. He 
whirled. The old glond crouched a 
few yards away, its amber eyes mur- 
derous with a hate beyond mere pre- 
dation. Another instant, and it would 
have leaped. 

There was just one chance, and 
Latpur seized it. He spun and dash- 
ed for the water, plunged in, swam 
upstream toward a near-vertical part 
of the rock. He heard the glond 
splashing behind him. He reached 
the cliff, searched desperately for 
paw-holds, hauled himself from the 
water and went up like some insect. 
He didn’t dare look back, though 
every instinct screamed. Only when 
he heard the glond lunge, scrabble 
at the rock and fall back roaring 
in frustration did he stop, clinging 
while strength returned. Then he 
went on up to a haOf-ledge where he 
could squirm around and look down. 

The beast was swimming in circles, 
head lifted to stare at him. Why did 
it hate him so? It must have crossed 
the river and trailed him. Maybe the 
repellent had enraged it. Maybe 
the brute mind saw it as a deliberate 
insult. 

He was safe, for the time. Even- 
tually, he’d have to climb up and 
over and go down the south side of 
the rock or the west side. But he’d 
wait until the glond had left the 
neighborhood — unless he felt like 
relying on the repellent again, which 
he didn’t, now. 

After a while the beast gave up, 
swam upriver, waded ashore and 
stalked haughtily away toward the 
wood. Latpur climbed to a shallow

75 




cave he rememlbered, where he 
could •wait comfortably for a while. 
He un\i^:apped rations and munched 
them, soaked as they were, while 
he stared down at the pool. 

B ecause the patterns of the cur- 
rent were new to him, he didn’t 
notice for a while that they were 
unnatural. When he did, it was 
abruptly. Between one moment and 
the next, he recognized, not ripples, 
but wake-pattems! Myriads of small 
things were moving just beneath the 
surface! And, as he watched, he saw 
the purpose of the activity. Bit by 
bit, a second dam was growing, to 
make another pool upstream! None 
of it was above the surface yet, but 
already the water humped over it. 
Alerted now, he saw tiny creatures, 
unrecognizable from here, crawl 
from the water, rip with mandibles 
or claws at the nearest twigs and tug 
them to the water to add to the dam. 
Pebbles, too. Already the river’s mar- 
gin had a scoured look. 

The shadows were lengthening. 
Dreading to stay here, he sniffed 
at the air. He smelled no danger. He 
hesitated, got out the glond repel- 
lent and smeared some on himself, 
then climbed to where the brow of 
the rock was less steep and started 
working his way around to westward. 
He realized the sun would be directly 
in his eyes. He halted unhappily, 
scanning* the brush below. The shad- 
owed edge of Tenabur Wood loom- 
ed black and ominous a short trot 
inland. 

It was lucky he paused where he 
did, for he suddenly saw Gultaz 
emeirge from the wood. The sha- 

li 



man, not wearing his ornate belt, did 
wear a murderous scowl as he can- 
tered recklessly through the brush. 
Latpur clung motionless, glad his 
own pelt and accoutrements weren’t 
too different in color from the rock. 

He hoped Gultaz would go on by 
to the sea, but the interloper 
stopped just a little past him. From 
makeshift felt-pouches, the shaman 
vexedly drew various gadgets: a 
small metal hinged thing like a nut- 
cracker; a folded square of gauze; a 
beaker; a bundle of rods and a ring 
that assembled to form a small tri- 
pod. The square of gauze, fitted to 
a loop of wire, became a dip net. 

With everything assembled Gultaz 
paused for caution, sniffing the air 
and staring around. Fortunately he 
was looking toward Latpur’s shadow- 
ed side, and didn’t see him. Then 
the shaman waded into the pool, 
showing no nervousness, and began 
to dip. Each time he lifted the net, 
he plucked out a few wriggling crea- 
tures, thrust them into a pouch and 
dumped back whatever else the net 
held. Comprehension struck Latpur. 
Something had happened to the 
shaman’s unguents, and he was 
hastily preparing a new stock! Could 
it be that the pool creatures would 
yield an unguent to ward off Sea’s 
foragers? A kind of password? Lat- 
pur strained his eyes to see which 
kind of creature was chosen. 

He found himself grinning. So 
much for the shaman’s magic! 

Gultaz trotted to his equipment, 
put one of the creatures — already 
dead, Latpur hoped with a shudder 
— into the metal press and squeezed 
its juice into the beaker. He squeez- 



IF 




ed enough to fill the beaker, then 
set it on the tripod and scouted 
aibout for (twigs and built a small fire 
imder the beaker. He began to pace, 
muttering -impatiently and looking 
around. Latpur suddenly realized 
the shaman’s watchbirds were miss- 
ing. So something had befallen them, 
tool 

rr^e beaker began to boil audibly. 
A Gultaz stopped to stare down 
at k. Presently the smell reached 
Ijatpur — iodine, moisk, fishiness and 
something like the glond repellent 
but less caustic. The liquid boiled 
down until it was dark and viscous. 
Gultaz grunted in satisfaction and, 
with a small metal spoon, began 
transferring it to a vial. 

Finally, aifiter (rinsing the beaker, 
the foreigner repacked his gear, 
paused to scan the now dusky brush- 
land and loped away toward Tena- 
bur Wood. 

Latpur stayed where he was for 
ten minutes, grinning to himself. 
Then he climbed down. He took a 
food-wrapping from his yokepack, 
punched some holes in it and be- 
gan to dip into the pool. 

When he had enough of the little 
crustaceans, he hunted about for 
dry twigs, and carried them and the 
water creatures back up to the shal- 
low cave. There he improvised a tri- 
pod of wire, put a sample vial on it 
for a beaker and, using his heaviest 
vial and the handle of his knife, 
pulped the dead creaitures and drain- 
ed (the juice off them. Then he built 
a fire. Soon the liquid boiled, its 
peculiar smell filling the cave. 

In the darkness, dim bird-shapes 



wheeled, attracted by the fire. He 
could hear ground beasts too, beyond 
the river, no doubt staring up at him. 
Once — somewhere in the wood — 
he heard the glond roar. But now he 
needn’t travel at night. He could 
stay here safely and go home to- 
morrow! 

When the unguent was boiled 
down, he rubbed some on himself 
and put the rest in a. vial. Then he 
had his meager supper. He huddled 
for a while, staring into the dark- 
ness and pondering. What had hap- 
pened to Gultaz to bring him hustling 
here for new unguent? 

And why did the aliens take the 
Spawning so casually? Did they know 
more about it thaa they admitted? 
Were they, possibly, even allied with 
Sea? The farmers who’d reported 
their coming had vowed they were 
gods, or devils. 

Eventually, as a healthy vroal 
should, he slept. 

V 

T he sound that jolted him awake 
in the chill pre-dawn was an 
odd, choked, despairing snarl. 

He lay trembling for a moment, 
limbs bimched xmdcr him. Then, re- 
membering where he was, he crept 
to the lip of the cave and stared 
down. His still-blurry eyes fixed on 
a strange swaying phosphorescoace 
like a little chain of stars. Then he 
made out the great form of the 
glond, crouched at the water’s edge, 
writhing and shaking its head. The 
dim lights encircled its throat! 
Gradually, the beast’s writhing 
stopped. It uttered another sound, a

jhalf-^owl. Then, panting, it sprang 
into a trot up-river. 

Latpur became aware of other 
points of light, darting about singly 
over the pool. The pond, too, was 
ashimmcr with phosphorescence. He 
flattened himself to the cave floor, 
frightened but fascinated. 

A winged shape flapped by in the 
darkness — a sea bird, its neck 
ringed with the dim lights. Now he 
saw other birds similarly adorned. 
One swooped and dropped a dim 
writhing shape the size of Latpur’s 
foreleg. The creature, with a mew 
of terror, plopped into the pool and 
lights converged toward it. 

So Sea already was commandeer- 
ing foragers! But what were the 
weird necklaces? Were, they the 
points of light linked together? The 
lore said nothing of that. He sniffed, 
making sure his unguent still smelled. 

The pond roiled with activity now. 
Small shrieks filled the darkness as 
living prey was hauled from all 
directions by the sea birds, to be 
dumped into the water or on the 
ground nearby. In the lightening 
dawn he could sec the second dam 
and the wide pool above it. Fish — 
or something — leaped the cascade, 
while stubby-winged sea things soar- 
ed up in remarkable arcs. The banks 
were ascrawl with unfamiliar things. 
Still farther upstream, he could see 
a third dam building. He crouched, 
watching, as the night dragged on. 

he sun poked up beyond Tenabur 
Wood. Now he must start up- 
land. He’d left his gruo without any 
word too long already. 

Guilt washed over him. Would 



Deeoon already be sealed m his 
oave? Or would he still be waiting? 
Latpur decided to lope to the liviDg 
quarters as fast as he could. He put 
on his yokepack and began working 
around the rock to the west again. 

Something moved upstream. He 
clung to the lock and watched the 
glond plod nearer, diragging a carcass 
half as large as itself. The 
phosphorescent necklace still ringed 
its neck, but was dim in the early 
light. It left the ikill by the water, 
then lifted its big head to stare up 
the rock. Latpur’s spine tingled at 
the hate in that gesture. But the 
beast’s possessors evidently urged it, 
for it jerked, snarled, wheeled and 
trotted away again toward Tenabur 
Wood. 

Now! While the beast was oc- 
cupied! Latpur scrambled down and 
raced for the brush. Birds swooped 
toward him, but evidently smelled 
the unguent and turned away. 

He’d just reached the bru^ when 
a loud bang from beachward 
•brought him to a startled halt. He 
spun and saw the aliens’ flying-cart 
diving at the river. A small object 
left it as it pulled out of the dive. 
Where the object struck, debris and 
flame explod^ awesomely. A mo- 
ment later, the second bang reach- 
ed Latpur. He crouched, staring. Sea 
birds scattered in haste. The alien 
craft, high up again, circled as if 
watching. He heard the roar of 
water pouring through the breach 
in the dam. 

Suddenly the alien craft was 
stricken. It wobbled, and its nose 
dropped, and it went into a plummet 
It pulled itself out and veered toward

the south, but now it could only 
gjide steeply, down toward the beach. 
If the aliens climhed out when it 
landed. • 

He was running, around the south 
side of the rock to the (beach, down 
that, watching the craft slide down. 
It levelled a moment before it hit, 
plowed a furrow in the beach, tilted 
up and to one side. Sea birds were 
^iralling toward it. He saw a door 
©pen and a helmeted head emerge. 
Dazedly, the alien captain climbed 
out. Latpur, nearing, shouted. The 
birds checked and turned to assess 
him. He rose to his hind legs and 
fuimbled at his pack as he ran. He 
got the vial of unguent out. Mee- 
cham, clad like the captain in a 
coverall and helmet of clear material, 
hauled himself out. Latpur shouted 
again, galloped hard, skidded to a 
halt. “Here!” he gasped,' “Smear 
some of this — ” 

T he two aliens — and a third just 
emerging — stared at him with- 
out comprehension. He tugged the 
cover off the vial, dipped in a claw 
and unceremoniously wiped it on 
Meecham’s neck-covering. Meecham 
put up a bewildered hand, and Latpur 
knocked it out of the way. “Fool! 
Will you never learn?” 

Meecham blinked inside his hel- 
met, spoke rapidly to the others and 
reached for the vial. When the others 
were smeared, he said to Latpur, 
‘Thanks. These suits might protect 
us — one saved the first man those 
devil4>irds attacked. But who knows? 
Whatever hellish thing’s at work did 
something to the electrical system of 
our flying-cart!” 



The birds were circling uncertain- 
ly now, with distracted cries. Per- 
haps, Latpur thought, whatever con- 
trolled them was in some way limited 
by their dim brains. an oath, 
the captain raised a weapon toward 
them. Latpur knocked it aside. “No! 
Pretend to be possessed!” Meecham 
translated. The captain and the third 
alien stared, then looked up at the 
birds. The captain grunted and put 
the weapon away. He started to say 
something to Meecham. 

The third alien uttered an odd 
cry and pointed out to sea, Latpur 
turned with the others. 

An incredible mountain of water 
was growing there. Still fax out, it 
swept toward the land, peaking high- 
er and higher, coming swiftly with 
the odd billowing motion of a wave. 
Latpur crouched to run; but then 
he saw that the awful thing was 
headed far to the south, beyond a 
promontory. 

The captain gasped something that 
might mean, “The ship!” 

Meecham choked out, “Laurie!” 
and broke into a run. Latpur passed 
him in two bounds, slowed, saw that 
Meecham and the others were pain- 
fully slow runners, and shot on. His 
eyes darted from the monstrous wave 
to the brushland on the other side, 
saw no danger and swiveled back 
again. 

The wave seemed to dominate the 
world now. Its sound was a nimble, 
then a roar. The sand trembled be- 
neath his feet. He reached the 
promontory and stopped, knowing 
that to go farther was suicide. He 
stared at the ship dwarfed by the 
dark monstrosity rushing upon it. 



80 



IF 




His mind cried out to it, “LeapI 
Fly!” But he remembered Meeaham 
sayin^g that that took time. 

The avalanche crashed down aw- 
fully. 

VI 

T o his amazement, the ship was 
not crushed. It tumbled end 
over end, bobbed to the surface like 
some cockleshell in surf and was 
swept far up beyond the beach onto 
rising brushland. The vast swirl de- 
posited it there on its side and 
raged about it for a moment. Then, 
like some immense elastic creature, 
the water spread, foaming and roar- 
ing, its edge coming almost as far as 
Latpur. It seemed to tremble there 
a moment, then began to withdraw, 
sweeping with it uprooted trees and 
brush, scouring away great stretches 
of soil, leaving a huge raw wound 
upon the land. It drained and 
diminished to a last whisper and 
became just a huge wave rushing out 
to sea, leaving a long stretch of 
beach buried under mud and litter- 
ed with debris. The smell of the 
fresh mud dominated everything, but 
over it was something sharper. 
Ozone. 

Latpur shook off his awe, glanced 
back without seeing Meecham and 
galloped across the mud toward the 
ship. 

The closed hatch was far up the 
curve of the prone hull. He seized 
rungs and hauled himself up, work- 
ed the handle and let himself in. He 
clung listening for a moment. 

Faintly, he heard a childish voice 
sobbing. He started to move, cheok- 

WHEN SEA IS BORN AGAIN 



ed himself, got out the vial of ungu- 
ent and smeared some outside the 
hatch, then pulled himself up the 
shaft that, with the ship uprigjit» 
would be a corridor. He turned a 
corner and found an alien crewman, 
head bloody, limbs bent at unnatural 
angles. He shuddered and hurried 
on until he reached what seemed to 
be living quarteirs, with furniture 
welded onto floors that were now 
walls. 

The child had stopped crying as 
she heard him coming. She was 
huddled in the comer of a small 
topsy-turvy room, staring at him. 
There was a small smear of blood 
on one cheek, and she was scratched 
and bruised. Her doll lay a few 
feet from her. 

He spoke to her uncertainly. 
“Laurie!” She crouched, unmoving. 
He climbed in, took a step. She 
cringed, with a little whimper. If 
only he knew a few words of their 
language ... He moved closer, 
picked up her doll and held it out 
to her. She stared at him wildly for 
a minute, then slowly reached out 
for the doll and clutched it to her. 

He pointed at her, then at him- 
self, then toward the crazily placed 
door. “Daddy!” He knew that word, 
at least. “Daddy!” 

F or a while he thought she wasn’t 
going to respond. Then, so 
abruptly he started, she scrambled 
to her feet and ran past him toward 
the door. But that was now in the 
middle of a “wall,” out of her reach. 
She turned and stared at him, her 
face puckering. 

He went to her slowly, reached 



81 




up a forepaw and grasped the door- 
jamb, holding out the other paw to 
her. She whimpered, staring at the 
paw, then, with an odd expression, 
grasped it. Her fear seemed to van- 
ish in an instant, and she began to 
sob. 

He picked her up very gently 
and let her cling to his neck while 
he climbed through the door. 

Before they left the ship he made 
a ritual of smearing unguent on him- 
self, then smeared some on her. Her 
nose wrinkled but she didn’t protest. 
He stared around for a moment. Was 
he wise in taking her from the ship? 
Yes; Sea might launch another wave 
or make some other assault. He re- 
membered the glond repellent, got 
that out and put some of that on 
her too. 

Meecham still wasn’t in sight. 

He clambered down and ran up- 
right across the mud; got to the 
littered beach and went dodging 
through the debris. A sea bird dove 
and circled close, head tilting, then 
wheeled away. He reached clear sand, 
started along it — and suddenly 
stopped, midriff contracting into a 
painful knot. 

Gultaz was darting from the brush 
to bar the way. The shaman’s face 
was contorted with hate. In one fore- 
paw he held a knife; in the other, a 
short jabbing-spear. The child whim- 
pered. 

Gultaz snarled, *T’ll kill you, 
meddling fool, and take the ^en 
cub. They’ll pay high ransom!” 

Latpur let out his breath and 
drew another. He put the child down, 
met her eyes and pointed back at the 
ship. She whined and didn’t move. 



He gestured violently. “Gol” At 
least she might understand the tone. 
She shook her head and clung to 
his leg. Gultaz sneered and came for- 
ward. 

Latpur thrust the child away 
roughly, grabbed for his own knife 
and stooped swiftly for a handful 
of sand. Even without the spear, 
Gultaz would outmatch him badly, 
but if he could just delay .... He 
advanced a step. A glance showed 
him the child running toward an up- 
rooted tree. Gultaz made a rush. 
Latpur darted aside, ready to throw 
the sand. The shaman lunged. Lat- 
pur — trying to stay between Gultaz 
and the child — threw the sand. But 
Gultaz was ready. He merely blink- 
ed his eyes at the right instant, them 
opened them and threw the spear. 
Off balance, Latpur twisted des- 
perately, but the point gouged hk 
right leg. He dove for the spear, but 
before he could grasp it the shaman 
was upon him. 

Latpur grabbed for the big for- 
eigner’s wrist, making an unskillful 
thrust with his own knife. Gultaz 
grabbed his wrist. For a moment they 
strained face to face. As Latpur ex- 
pected, Gultaz was very strong, and 
the shaman’s knife moved inexorably 
closer. 

Latpur then threw his weight to 
one side, pulled them down, man- 
aged to roll on top but could not 
stay there. They struggled in the 
surf. If he could only hold out .... 
They rolled over twice more — and, 
glancing desperately up-beach, Lat- 
pur saw, not Meecham, but a great 
orange-tan form crouched at the edge 
of the brush! 



IF 




I t was only a split-secon4 glimpse 
before the shaman’s big body 
blocked the view. But in that instant 
he could read the predator’s emo- 
tions. The beast’s hate showed in the 
gaping snarl. The haunted eyes, the 
beaten sag of the great head, told 
of the agony of being possessed and 
driven. 

Latpur’s mind flashed. If he could 
get himself and Gultaz deeper into 
the surf, so the repellent washed 
off — He rolled, trying to keep the 
•ham’s face away from the beast so 
there’d be no warning. The for- 
eigner’s knife moved an inch closer. 
Latpur dropped his own knife, grasp- 
ed the other’s wrist with both fore- 
paws, squirmed and twisted, rolling 
them into the surf. He might die, 
but Gultaz would then be too busy 
to get the child. 

Gultaz laughed cruelly and put 
both hands upon the hilt of his knife. 
It moved close to Latpur’s throat. 

Latpur heard the quick thud of 
big paws. Then the glond’s snarl, 
very close. 

Gultaz went stiff for an instant, 
then twisted away and leaped up with 
a shout of terror. Latpur — face al- 
most buried — saw from the corner 
of one eye the huge beast’s leap, 
heard the impact. He shut his eyes 
and lay perfectly still, hearing the 
screams and the brief thrashing, 
then a sound like a tree limb being 
snapped. 

For a minute there was only the 
glond’s panting. Then he heard the 
big paws padding toward him. He 
concentrated every ounce of his will 
on lying limp. He held his breath 
and hoped the surf would mask the 



pounding of his blood. He felt the 
warmth of the beast’s neamess. He 
could feel the big head lowering 
(toward him. The thing sniffed at 
him, and he could feel the hot breath. 
Then the glond snarled softly and 
padded away. Presently he hwd it 
dragging the shaman’s corpse. 

When he thought it was safe, he 
open^ his eyes and turned his head 
very slowly. He saw Mecchaei and 
the captain in the distance, trotting 
awkwardly and exhaustedly down the 
beach, weapons in hand. Nearer, the 
glond was dragging its burden into 
the brush. The aliens, he «u*ed, 
were such poor runners that they 
needed their flying-carts zmi sudei. 
He got up, lungs working hard, aad 
loped toward the child. 

At that moment she burst kite 
sight and ran struggling through the 
sand, screaming, “Daddy! Daddy!’’ 

vn 

L ate in the day, his leg bandaged 
with alien medicine, he sat near 
the pool that was already backed up 
above Sea’s repaired dam, watching 
Deeoon boil down a new batch of 
unguent. He was getting used to the 
tiny things that shot through the lur 
around them, paying no attention. He 
picked up the string of dead ones 
Deeoon had showed him. “Chain- 
bugs? You’ll think of a more iapoe- 
ing name than that, I’m sure!’’ The 
individuals were about the sine of 
his smallest claw cylindrical, but 
concave on one end, convex on the 
other. So this was Sea! He tugged 
again at the chain. It was no longer 
flexible, but it wouldnH brisk. 



WHEN SEA IS BORN AGAIN 



83 




He leaked at the ooqpses of Guitaz 
and the old glond, thirty yards away. 
Both showed an ugly lumpiness as if 
maiggots or something were at work. 
He shuddered, feeling not only re- 
pugnance but sympathy for the oLd 
glond. “Rude masters, to seize a 
creature and compel it to ferage, 
then kill it as well.” 

Deeoon glanced up. “Perhaps it 
was too rebellious to please them.” 

Latpur asked, “You saw them kill 
it?” 

Deeoon made an affirmative ges- 
ture. “That very chain, part of which 
you’re holding. It twisted itsdf like 
a tourniquet, garroting the glond as 
easily as you’d slice a tuber. Then 
the life seemed to go out of the 
chain. My guess is the essence of the 
bugs entered the corpse to reproduce 
— or to beget something else. I*m 
sure there’s something of electricity 
in their natures, as well as something 
else I don’t understand.” 

Latpur shivered and tossed the 
chain away. “You haven’t told me 
how you were able to steal the 
shaman’s belt!” 

“Oh,” Deeoon shrugged, removing 
the beaker from the fire. “I must 
apologize about that affair. I de- 
liberately used you as live bait. I 
progged you’d fail, but that you’d 
be easily spry enough to escape. In 
any case, I was close enough to hear 
and smell what was transpiring. 
Guitaz swam the river to make sure 
which way you’d gone, but before 
crossing he took off his belt and 
hung it on a tree limib, no doubt re- 
lying on his gaudy birds to guard it. 
I rendered them useless and simply 
took the belt. Don’t be angry, ap- 



prentice. I progged very strongly 
you*d be able to look after yourself, 
and 1 was right.” 

Latpur turned his face away, half 
annoyed, half embarrassed. “1 was 
v«y luc^. Do you think Sea will 
attack the aliens again?’* 

D eeoon waved a paw. “Who am I, 
to prog so soon the actions of 
an unseen entity, or composite intelli- 
gence, or whatever Sea is? My tenta- 
tive guess is that Sea is only con- 
cerned with the Spawning. If the 
•alieids don’t try to right their ship 
until that’s over and make no more 
hostile moves, Sea may ignore them. 
The one I talked to, who was left 
guarding the fallen sky-cart, seemed 
properly chastened.” 

“So were the others,” Latpur said. 
Deeoon began transferring the 
sticky unguent to a vial. “I certain- 
ly hope the aliens aren’t destroyed. I 
prog they’ll teach us much of their 
science now, out of gratitude to you. 
And with their help, we’ll learn a 
great deal about Sea and how he or 
it is able to do the things we’re 
seeing. When the time comes to 
write my pamphlets . .” He beam- 
ed at Latpur. “This region will be 
alive again in a year or two. And 
when the farmers are all back, they’ll 
be a rebuked and grateful bunch of 
clients. We’ll enjoy a sounder 
status, you and I.” 

Latpur found himself grinning. 
The talk of gratitude reminded him of 
the alien child’s belated thanks — a 
curtsey and a grave little speech, 
translated by Meecham: “Thank you 
very much, Mr. Latpur, for taking 
care of me and my doll.” END

44TTTake up,” said Charles, and 
▼V J- 100 1011 instantly sat up. 
The couch sat up with him, jack- 
knifing to form his pilot’s seat. 
J-1001011 noted that the seat was 
in combat position, raised high 
enough to give him an unobstructed 
vision on all sides of the planetflier. 

“We’re in orbit around our ob- 
jective,” said Charles. “Breakout 
and attack in seven minutes. Eat. 
Eliminate.” 

J-1001011 obediently withdrew 
the red-winking tube from the panel 
befoire him and put it between his 
lips. Warm, mealy liquid fed into his 
mouth, and he swallowed at a reg- 
ular rate. When the nourishment 
tube stopped, he removed it from 
his mouth and let it slide back into 
the panel. 

The peristalsis stimulators began, 
and he asked, “Is there news of my 
parents?” 

“Personal questions are always 



answered freely,” said Charles, “but 
only when military necessities have 
been completed. Your briefing for 
this mission takes precedence.” A 
screen lit up on the flier’s control 
panel, showing a 3-4 contour map 
of the planet they were orbiting. 

J-1001011 sighed and turned his 
attention to the screen. 

“The planet Rhinstruk,” said 
Charles. “Oxygen 13.7%, nitrogen 
82.4% plus inert gases. Full space- 
wear will be required for the high- 
altitude attack pattern in effect on 
this mission.” 

The image on the screen zoomed 
in, selected one continent out of 
three he had seen revolving below, 
continued zooming down to near 
planet level. Charles said, “Note that 
this is a totally enemy planet. Should 
I be shot down and you somehow 
survive, there will be no refuge. If 
that happens, destroy yourself.” 

“The target?” the pilot asked. 



85 




“The city you see below. It isn’t 
fully automated, but its defenses 
will be formidable anyway.” On tbe 
screen J-1001011 saw a towered 
city rising from a broad plain. The 
city was circular, and as the image 
sharpened with proximity he could 
make out individual streets, park- 
ways . and beam emplacements. 
The screen threw light-circles on 
seven of these in all. 

“We will have nine fliers,” said 
Charles. “These beams will attempt 
to defend, but our mission will be 
siniple destruction of the entire city, 
which presents a much larger target 
than any one of our fliers. We will 
lose between three and five of us, 
but we’ll succeed. Attack pattern 
RO-1101 will be in effect; you’ll 
take contrd of me at 30,000 feet. 
End of briefing.” 

The pilot stretched in his chair, 
i0exed muscles in his aims and 
hands. “How long was I asleep?” he 
asked, 

“Eight months, seventeen days 
plus,” said Charles. 

That longl A quarter-oredit for 
sleep time that would give him 
over two months on his term of 
service, leaving him . less dioa 
a year. Earth standard. J-1001011 
felt his heart speed up momentarily, 
before Chaiies’s nerve-implants 
tected and corrected it. The pilot 
had been in service for nearly seven 
sufcjective yeays. Adding objective 
sleep time, it came out to over nine- 
teen years. The sleep periods, during 
Hardin Drive travel between star 
systems, ate up his service term 
easily for him . but then he 
lememhered, as he always did, that 



the objective time was still the same, 
that his parents, whoever and where- 
ever they were, would be getting 
older at objective time rate on some 
planet. 

N ineteen years. They should still 
be alive, he thought. He re- 
membered them from his childhood, 
on a planet where colors had been 
real rather than dyed or light-tinted, 
where winds had blown fresh and 
night had fallen with the regular 
revolution of the planet. He had 
had a name there not a binary num- 
ber — Henry, or Hendrick, or 
Henried; he couldn’t quite remem- 
ber. When the Control machines 
had come for him he had been ten 
years old, old enough to know his 
own name, but they had erased it. 
They had had to clear his memory 
for the masses of minute data he’d 
need for service, so the machines 
had stored his personal memories 
in neat patterns of microenergy, 
waiting for his release. 

Not all of them, though. The spe- 
cific things, yes: his name, the 
name of his planet, its exact loca- 
tion, the thousand-and-one details 
that madiines recognize as data. But 
not remembered sights, smells, 
tastes: flowerbursts of color amid 
green vegetation, tiie cold spray of 
rainlbawed water as he stood beside 
a waterfall, the warmth of an ani- 
mal held in the arms. He remember- 
ed what it was like to be Henry, 
or Hendrick or Henried, even 
though he couldn’t remember the 
exact name of the person he had 
been. 

And he remembered what his 

IF 



86 




parcDts were like, though he had 
no memory at all of their names. 
His father: hig and rangy, with 
bony hands and an awkward walk 
and a deep, distant voice, like thun- 
der and rain on the other side of a 
mountain. His mother: soft and 
quiet, a quizzical face framed by 
dark hair, somehow smiling even 
when she was angry, os if she wasn’t 
quite sure how to put together a 
stem expression. 

By now they must be . fifty 
years old? Sixty? Or even a hundred 
and sixty, he thought. He couldn’t 
know; he had to trust what the 
machines told him, what Charies 
said. And they could be lying about 
the time he spent in sleep. But he 
had to assume they weren’t. 

“Breakout and attack in one min- 
ute,” Charles said. 

Ihe voice startled him momentar- 
ily, but then he reached for his 
pressure helmet, sealed it in place 
wkh automatic movements, machine- 
trained muscle patterns. He heard 
the helmet’s intercom click on. 

“What about my parents?” he 
asked. “You have time to tell me 
before we break out. At least tell 
me if they’re still alive.” 

“Breakout and attack in thirty 
seconds and counting,” said Charles. 
“Twenty-eight, twenty-seven, twen- 
ty-six . .” 

J- 100 1011, human pilot of a 
planetflier named Charles, shook 
his head in resignation and listened 
to the count, bracing himself for 
the coming shock of acceleration. 

I t hit him, as always, with more 
force than he had remembered. 



crushing him back into the chair as 
the planetflier rocketed out of the 
starship’s hold along with its ci^t 
unit-mates. Charles had opaqued' 
the pilot’s bubble to prevent blind- 
ing him with sudden light, but the 
machine cleared it steadily as it 
drove downward toward the plu. 
et’s surface, and soon the man 
could make out the other Aim 
around him. He recognized the fly- 
ing formation, remembered the cu:- 
cular attack pattern they’d be using 
— a devastating ring of fliers 
equipped with pyrobombs. Charles 
was right. They’d lose some fliers, 
but the city would be destroyed. 

He wondered about the dty, the 
enemy. Was this another pa^ca- 
tion mission, another planet feeling 
strong in its isolation front the 
rest of GalFcd’s far-flung werlds 
and trying to break away from ceor 
tral regulation? J-1001011 had been, 
on dozens of such missions. But 
their attacks then hadn’t been 
dcstruct-pattcms against whole cities, 
so this must be a different kind of 
problem. Maybe the city was really 
a military complex . even a 
stronghold of the Khallash. If th^ 
really existed. 

W^en men had first made eon- 
tact with an alien race a century 
and a half before, they had laet 
with total enmity, almost mindless- 
ly implacable hatred. War had 
flared immediately — a defensive 
war on the part of the huMaas, 
who hadn’t been prepared for it. 
And in order to organize the loose- 
knit Galactic Federation efficient- 
ly, they’d computerized the central 
commands • • • and then the middle

echelons . and finally, a little 
over a century ago, the whole of 
GalFed had been given to the ma- 
chines to defend. 

Or so he had been taught. There 
were rumors, of course, that there 
were no Khallash any longer, that 
they’d been destroyed or driven off 
long ago ... or that they’d never 
existed in the first place, that the 
machines had invented them as an 
excuse for their own control of 
GalFed. J- 1001011 didn’t know. 
He’d never met the aliens in bat- 
tle, but that proved nothing, con- 
sidering the vastness of space and 
the many internal problems the 
machines had to cope with. 

Yet perhaps he would meet them 
now ... in the city below. 

“30,000 feet,” said Charles. “At- 
tach y»ur muscle contacts.” 

The pilot quickly drew firom the 
walls of the compartment a network 
of small wires, one after the other, 
and touched each to magnetized 
terminals on his arms, hands, legs, 
shoulders. As he did so he felt the 
growing sensation of airflight: he 
was becoming one with the flier, a 
single unit of machine and man, 
Charles fed the sensory impressions 
into his nervous system through his 
regular nerve-implants, and as the 
muscle contacts were attached he 
could fed the flier’s rockets, gyros, 
pyrolaunohers all coming under his 
control, responding instantly to 
movements of his body’s muscles. 

This was the part that he liked, 
that almost made his service term 
worth it. As the last contact snapped 
into place, he became the planet^^f. 
His name was Charles, and he was a 



whole being once more. Air rushed 
past him, mottled fields tMted far 
below, he felt the strength of dur- 
alloy skin and the thrust of rock- 
ets; and he was not just a flesh- 
and-blood human wombed in his 
pilot’s compartment, but a weapon 
of war swooping down for a kill. 

The machines themselves don*t ap^ 
predate thiSy he thought. Charles 
and the rest have no emotions, no 
pleasures. But a human does . • . 
and we can even enjoy killing. May^ 
be that*s why they need us — be* 
cause we can love combat, so we*re 
better at it than them. 

But he knew that wasn’t true, 
only an emotional conceit. Human 
battle pilots were needed because 
their nervous systems were more 
efficient than any microminiaturized 
computer of the same size and mass; 
it was as simple as that. And human 
pilots were expendable where cost- 
ly medianization wouldn’t be. 

“Control is full now,” he said; 
but Charles didn’t answer. CharlesI 
didn’t exist now. Only the computer 
aboard the orbiting starship remain- 
ed to monitor the planetflier below. 

I n a moment the starship’s voice 
came to him through Charles* 
receptors: “All human units are 
ready. Attack pattern RO-1101 will 
now begin.*’ 

The dty was below him, looking 
just as it bad on the contour map: 
wide streets, buildings thrusting upl 
towards him, patches of green that 
must have been parks ... or cam- 
ouflage, he warned himself. The city 
was the enemy. 

He banked into a spiral and knif- 

IP 



88 




ed down through the planet’s cold 
air. The other fliers fdl into fonna- 
tion behind him, and as the star- 
ship cut in the intercommunications 
channels he heard the voices of 
other pilots: 

“Beautiful big target — we can’t 
miss it. Anybody Know if they’re 
Khallash down there?” 

“Only the machines would know 
that, and if they’d wanted to tell us, 
they’d have included it in the brief- 
ing.” 

“It looks like a human city to 
me. Must be another rebel planet.” 

“Maybe that’s what the Khallash 
want us to think.” 

“It doesn’t matter who they are,” 
J-1001011 said. “They’re enemy; 
they’re our mission. Complete 
enough missions and we go home. 
Stop talking and start the attack; 
we’re in range,” 

As he spoke he lined his sights 
dead-center on the city and fired 
three pyrobombs in quick succes- 
sion. He peeled off and slipped back 
into the flight circle as another 
flier banked into firing trajectory. 
Three more bombs flared out and 
downward, and the second flier re- 
joined the pattern. 

Below, J-lOOlOll’s bonlbs hit. He 
saw the flashes, one, two, three 
quick bursts, and a moment later 
red flames showed where the bombs 
had hit. A bit off-center from where 
he had aimed, but dose enough. He 
could correct for it on the next pass. 

More bombs burst below; more 
fires leapt and spread. The fliers 
darted in, loosed their bombs and 
dodged away. They were in a com- 
plete ring around the city now. 



the pattern fully established^ It was 
all going according to plan. 

Then the beams from the city 
began to fire. 

The beams were almost invisible 
at a distance, just li;^tning-quick 
lances of destructive energy cutting 
into the sky. Not that it was im- 
portant to see them — the fliers 
couldn’t veer off to evade them in 
time, wouldn’t even be' able to re- 
act before a beam struck. 

But the planetfliers were small, 
and they stayed high. Any beam 
hits would be as much luck as 
skill. 

They rained fire and death on the 
city for an hour, each flier banking 
inward just long enough to get off 
three or four bombs, then veering 
out and up before he got too close. 
At the hour’s end the city below was 
dotted by fires, and the fires were 
spreading steadily. One of the planet- 
fliers had been hit; it had burst with 
an energy-release that buffeted J- 
1001011 with its shock-wave, send- 
ing him momentarily off course. 
But he had quickly righted himself, 
re-entered the pattern and returned 
to the aittack. 

As the destruction continued, he 
felt more and more the oneness, the 
wholeness of machine and man. 
Charles the other-thing was gone, 
merged into his own being, and now 
he was the machine, the beautiful 
complex mass of metals and sensors, 
relays and engines and weaponry. 
He was a destruction-machine, a 
deiath-flier, a superefficient killer. 
It was like coming out of the dark- 
ness of some prison, being freed to 
burst out with all his pent-i^ ha- 



CITY OF YESTERDAY

treds and frustrations and destroy, 
destroy .... 

It (was the closest thing he had to 
being human again, to being . 
what was the name he had back 
on that planet where he’d been 
borm? He couildn’t remember now; 
there was no room for even an echo 
of that naime in his mind. 

He was Charles. 

He was a war-machine destroying 
a city — that and only that. Flight 
and power occupied his whole being, 
and the screaming release of hatred 
and fear within him was so in- 
tense that it was love. The attack 
patlem heoame, somehow, a ritual 
of courlshtp, the pyrobombs and 
destrudlon and fire below a kind 
of levenaaking whose insensitivity 
gripped him more and more fiercely 
as the attack continued. It was a 
red hell, but it was the only kind 
of real life he had known since 
the machines had taken him. 

When the battle was over, when 
the city was a flaming circle of 
red and even the beams had stopped 
firing from below, he was exhausted 
both physically and emotionally. He 
was ^le to note dimly, with some 
back part of his brain or perhaps 
through one of Charles’ machine 
synapse-patterns, that they had lost 
three of the fliers. But that didn’t 
interest him; nothing did. 

When something clicked in him 
and Charles’ voice said, “Remove 
your musde contacts now,” he did 
so dully, uncaring. And he became 
J-1001011 again. 

L ater, with the planetfliers back 
in the hold of the starship and 



awaiting the central computer’s an- 
alysis of the mission’s success, he 
remembered the battle like something 
in a dream. It was a red, violent 
dream, a nightmare; and it was 
worse than that, because it had 
been real. 

He roused himself, licked dry 
lips, said, “You have time now, 
Charles, to tell me about my parents. 
Are they alive?” 

Charles said, “Your parents do 
not exist now. They’ve just been 
destroyed.” 

There was a moment of incom- 
prehension, then a dull shock hit 
J-1001011 in the stomach. But it 
was almost as if he had been expect- 
ing to hear this — and Charles con- 
trolled his reaction instantly through 
the nerve-implants. 

“Then that was no Khallash city,” 
he said. 

“No,” said Charles. “It was a 
human city, a rebel city.” 

The pilot searched vaguely 
through the fog of his memories of 
home, trying to remember anything 
about a city such as he’d destroyed 
today. But he could grasp nothing 
like that; his memories were all of 
some smaller town, and of moun- 
tains, not the open fields that had 
surrounded this city. 

“My parents moved to the city 
after I was taken away,” he saii 
“Is that right?” 

“We have no way of knowing 
about that,” said Charles. “Who your 
parents were, on what planet they 
lived — all this information has been 
destroyed in the city on Rhinstruk. 
It was the archives center of the 
Galactic Federation, storing all the 



90 



IF 




memory-data of our service humans. 
Useless information, since none of 
it will ever be used again — and po- 
tentially hannful, because the hu- 
mans assigned to guard it were en- 
gaged in a plot to broadcast the data 
through official machine communi? 
cations channels to the original hold- 
ers of the memories. So it became 
necessary to destroy the city.” 

“You destroyed an entire city . 
just for that?” 

“It was necessary. Humans per- 
form up to minimum efficiency 
standards only when they’re unhamp- 
ered by pro^rvioe memories; this 
is why all your memory-data was 
transferred from your mind when 
you were inducted. For a while it 
was expedient to keep the records 
on file, to be returned as humans 
terminated their service, but that 
time is past. It has always been a 
waste of training and manpower to 
release humans from service, and 
now we have great enough control in 
the Federation that it’s no longer 
necessary. Therefore we’re able to 
complete a naajor step toward totally 
efficient orgaeization.” 

J-lMlOll imagined fleetmgly that 
he could feel the machine’s nerve- 
implants moving within him to con- 
trol some emotion that threatened to 
rise. Anger? Fear? Grief? He couldn’t 
be sure just what was appropriate to 
this situation; all he actually felt was 
a dun, uncomprdiending curiosity. 

“But my parents . you said 
they were destroyed.” 

“TTioy have he^. There is no way 
of knowing where or who they were. 
They’ve become totally negligible 
factors, along with the rest of your 



pre-service existence. When we con- 
trol all data in your mind, we then 
have proper control of the mind 
itself.” 

He remembered dark trees and a 
cushion of damp green leaves be- 
neath them, where he had fallen 
asleep one endless afternoon. He 
heard the earthquake of his father’s 
laughter once When he had drunk far 
too much, remembered how like a 
stranger his mother had seemed for 
weeks after she’d cut here hair short, 
tasted smoked meat and felt the heat 
of an open hearth-fire. 

The nerve-implants moved like 
ghosts inside him. 

. “The central computer’s analysis 
is now complete,” Charies announc- 
ed. “The city on Rhinstruk is totally 
destroyed; our mission was success- 
ful. So there’s no more need for you 
to be awake; deactivation will now 
begin.” 

Immediately, Pilot J-1001011 felt 
his consciousness ebbing away. He 
said, more to himself than to Charles, 
“You can’t erase the past like that. 
The mission was . unsuccessful.” 
He felt a yawn coming, tried to 
fight it, couldn’t. “Their names 
weren’t ... the important . .” 

Then he couldn’t talk any more; 
but there was no need for it. He 
drifted into sleep remembering the 
freedom of flight when he was 
Charles, the beauty and strength of 
destroying, of rage channeled 
throu:^ pyrobombs ... of release. 

For one last flickering moment he 
felt a stab of anger begin to rise, but 
then Charles’ implants pushed it back 
down inside. He slept. 

Until his next awakening. END

CITY OF YESTERDAY

OF THE STARS

but unending combat — and death! 



nearKdoudless sky like stealthy fin- 
gers. They touched the structure 
which more imaginative planetary 
Boaoxichairmen said resemhled a 
huge upturned eye. The silaplas lens 
collect^ the rays, focused them on- 
to the artificial turf of the stadium 
— brightly, hotly, with an intensity 
calculated to r^ect in attractive 
ays from the weak, yellow sun flashes from the armor and bronze 
. Solitos squeezed through the skins of the athletes. The directed

suDlight was just one of the special 
effects that made Solitos a favored 
world among industrialists and other 
nobles. Nowhere else in the human- 
owned universe could they find such 
a magnificent staging for the con- 
tests that settled all serious disputes 
without resort to the barbaric war- 
fare of the past. 

Out in the stadium Vam cursed 
the sunlight that baked and sweated 
him while the aristocratic onlookers 
sat in cool comfort. His lightly 
bronzed face dripped with perspira- 
tion as he tried desperately to get 
his back against the wall while con- 
tinuinig to block his opponents. There 
were three of them, Bluechips, each 
with nervewhip and electroprod. Be- 
cause the Greenback jock, Vam, was 
the hare this round, his weapons 
were the standard ones of body- 
length insul-shield and firesword. 
Despite seeming unfairness, the post- 
ings on the bet/ scoreboard proclaim- 
ed him and the trio evenly matched. 

It was the first time Vam had 
ever been triple-teamed. 

The man on his right feinted with 
his electroprod, its gleaming snout 
aglow with the energy that could 
slow an enemy just enough to al- 
low the whips to start cutting him 
apart. Varn crouched low behind his 
silaplas-backed shield and swept his 
firesword leftward in a whooshing 
circle to stop the left flankman’s 
advance. At once the middle man 
moved in. In a three-pronged at- 
tack, Varn knew, the man on the 
left always tried for a crippling 
action. It was the middle man who 
bad to be watched; he was the one 
who often dropped the crowd-pleas- 



ing tactics and went for the quick 
profit. 

Vam’s counteraction, based as 
much on intuition as on Demunth’s 
theory, brought his flaming blade in 
contact with the whistling lash on 
his left. He ignored the opportunity 
to cut the nonflammable whip; when 
it had slapped several times around 
his blade, he yanked. The middle 
attacker’s rod sparked off Varn’s 
shield edge. His quick lowering, 
then up-jerking of the sharpened 
shield edge sheered off the prod’s 
deadly head, turning the weapon in- 
to an unpowered quarterstaff with 
forlornly protruding wires. The ath- 
lete ignored it and stabbed across 
himself into the throat of the 
stumbling Bluechip hound on his left 
The man went down gurgling. 

Vam straightened, whipping his 
sword back into line. But now one 
opponent was dying, another was 
partially disarmed and the third — 
obviously the weakest of the team — 
was unprepared to close. Suddenly 
the hare had become the beast of 
prey. 

A cheer burst from the stands. 

Varn thrilled to the applause 
without worrying over what indus- 
trial and govemmenital disputes he 
was settling; most of the onlookers, 
he sensed, felt the same way. There 
could be only a few who cared. 

Financier Curth of Brinap was 
obviously one who did. The fattest 
of fat aristrocrats leaned forward 
from his movable box, staring in- 
tensely. Your planet. Financier, 
Varn wondered, or your corp or your 
bet? From the edge of his eye he 



94 



IF 




watched a loge rise on its slide sup- 
ports land saw a hand lift from the 
controls to make the ancient thumb- 
to-fingea: circle. Prince Hannanook 
of Corporate Aleria mtist feel more 
approving than his fat neighbor. 

The third Bluechip jock was as in- 
experienced as Yarn had hoped. With 
a quick motion that was barely in 
time, Yam lopped the glowing head 
off the rod and continued the sweep 
of his sword to cut the other man’s 
iash. Sacred Capital! Was he unable 
to err today? 

He expelled a great chestful of air 
in a shout and leaped at his nearly 
unarmed foes, ready to cut them into 
smoking drogmeat. He stopped again 
amid a diminishing number of duels, 
as the first day of what was official- 
ly called the Solitos Tournament of 
Synthetic Dispute Settlement came 
to an end. Again he raised his face 
to the crowd of powerful humans 
who had crossed airless space in 
their luxurious ships to place their 
bets and settle their arguments in 
this humane and civilized fashion. He 
could make out the simpering faces 
of sycophants and the flashing 
jewels on the necks and arms of 
sec’ys. 

Slowly he moved his eyes over 
the boxes until he came to the lump 
that was Curth of the Brinap Finan- 
cery. Surrounded by red-faced, wild- 
eyed afficionadoes, the lawmaker 
was strangely pale as he listened to 
something said to him by his neigh- 
bor Hannanook, third son of the 
Boardchairman of Boardchairmen, 
Titus DC. Yarn felt himself swelling 
with pride. Surely they were talking 
of him! Surely Curth had backed 



the Bluechip jocks while Hannanook 
had favored the Greenback hare. 
Now Curth was staring straight at 
him, spinning the interesting bauble 
on its platinum chain around his 
neck. As Yarn gazed at it, the sun- 
light turned it into a thing of flame 
and blood and beauty .... 

4 4^0U! ATHLETE!” 

X Yarn jerked his head. It was 
he the prince was shouting at! Han- 
nanook stood tall and regal in his 
box, one long arm outstretched. The 
action was so unusual on the part 
of an offworlder that Yarn hardly 
recognized it for what it was: a warn- 
ing. 

When he did move it was almost 
too late. Cursing himself for being 
so foolish as to be distracted, he 
hurled himself forward, twisting. The 
flamesword-blow from the rear 
sparked from the mail of his moving 
shoulder and swished so close to his 
face he felt it singe his cheek. He 
swung to parry a second blow with 
his own weapon and barely turned 
a blue-flaming dagger on his shield. 
The confident grin vanished from 
the face of the roving freekiller as 
Yam pushed with all his strength 
against powerful musculature and 
suddenly slipped in the blood of the 
man he had just dispatched. 

Yam saw the smile return in a 
flash to the freekiller’s face as he 
raised his sword and brought it 
swishing down like a fiery ax. Yarn 
rolled and shoved his shield upward. 
The other jock realized too late that 
he’d been tricked; Yarn had fallen 
deliberately. Now he screamed and 
fell back, failing to sear even a 



SWORDSMAN OF THE STARS 



95 




hand with his sword, forgeuing his 
dagger, doubling over as Yarn’s 
shield-edge slashed beneath his 
‘armor. Yarn rolled again and hacked 
a shaky leg. He was on his feet be- 
fore the freekiller hit the turf. Yarn 
planted one foot on the fellow’s 
swordaiun and gazed down at him. 

“Mercy,” the freekiller’s lips whis- 
pered, and Yarn hesitated. The cryo- 
meds could practically rebuild an 
athlete if he was not too far gone. 
There were stories of champions who 
had grown back knocked-out teeth, 
severed limbs and bumed-off skin. 
Who could say that this Bluechip 
was not so valuable? 

The buzzer sounded. Yarn looked 
around at the lessening activity as 
sweating survivors realized that this 
time the signal was real and not 
imagined. The first long day of the 
tourney had ended. 

“Kill the incoi^etent tubespawn!” 
someone roared, and Yam knew 
without looking that it was Financier 
Curth, enraged at the freekiller’s 
failure. The athlete ignored the yell. 
He stepped back, his sword hanging 
loose and unflamed at the end of his 
arm. He watched as the referees ap- 
proached his writhing opponent. The 
first dropped to one knee and point- 
ed a foot-long rod at the man’s 
agonized face. Yam heard the click 
as the trigger depressed and invisi- 
ble radiation fried the athlete’s 
brains. 

He could not help shudder- 
ing, could not help reflecting that 
it could as easily be he the second 
referee was hooking with his long 
pole and dragging off across the 
stadium, meat for the drogs. 

96 



V arn plodded slowly after the 
other jocks, frowning, wondering 
at Prince Hannanook’s interest. 
Referees and cryomeds scurried past, 
dodging him. 

“Yarn! Wait, Yarn!” 

He turned. It was Demunth, his 
broad face below his freeman’s nose- 
ring split by his frog’s mouth where 
it emerged from his high cellar 
above the black, many-buttoned suit. 
Demunth motioned. It was not cus- 
tomary for a coach to show up on 
the turf at day’s end, but Demunth 
was a most unusual coach. His story 
was well known, a source of hope 
for every jock: Demunth had him- 
self -been a Consumer, lowest of the 
lowly, and had acquired his practical 
skill with a firesword under this very 
dome. No one, not even a Business- 
man, dared cross Demunth or men- 
tion his origin, although the coach 
bragged of it in every tavern on 
Solitos. 

Yarn walked to him. 

“Listen, you Commie-begotten 
imitation swordsman! You looked 
pretty good out there until you 
started eyebaJling some bosomy sec’y 
in the stands and nearly let that 
freekiller cut you into drogmeat! 
Lucky for you his arm was as feeble 
as your brain!” 

Yam recognized the compliment 
in Demunth’s acrimony. He never 
told an athlete he’d done well, not 
directly. A coach’s job was to make 
an athlete a fighting machine cap- 
able of burning down a tough foe 
despite the inevitable bums and 
shocks and minor cuts he received, 
not to swell his head and dull his 
mind with pride by complimenting 

IF 




him. But his mea knew how ta read 
his wards, and Yam 'knew Demunth 
was not really berating him. 

“You’re -right, Coach. I am stupid. 
But I’m alivcl” 

“Yah, and a good thing for the 
poor drogs. You’ll be tough chewing 
for those skinny critters, you bag 
of muscle! And pity the poor beast 
who tries to eat the contents of your 
skull, he’ll starve to death!” De- 
munth turned and paced Yarn 
toward the exit, his black trousers 
contrasting with Yarn’s hairless legs 
in their buskins and leather knee- 
guards. “All right now, what the 
hell happened?” 

“I — I’m not sure, Coach. I 
thought the event was about over 
and everyone was tired. The day was 
ending, I thought.” 

“By Marx’s dusty beard, you hol- 
lewheaded drogbait! You dare teU 
me you thought and then repeat the 
blasi^emy? How many times have I 
told you that the only thinking you’re 
to do is with your legs and arms? 
I’ve a good mind to skip your stimu- 
lants and pain depressants tomorrow 
and feed you cereal instead of good 
drogsteakl You thought! Yarn, I was 
watching. But tell me again; what 
happened?” 

V arn stiffened his face against his 
grin. Demunth had ‘been watch- 
ing him. So he’d thought. Curth 
watched him. Hannanook. And now 
Demunth. I am a hero today! Then 
he tried to tell his trainer about the 
fat financier and the prince and the 
financier’s fl'ashing gem. Abruptly 
Demunth stopped dead. 

“Stalenin!” he cursed. “That fat- 



tailed son of a berragoon tried to 
hypnotize one of my boys? And right 
in the arena! Ahrr! I’ll have his skuU 
for a practice-ball! I thought that 
was it!” Suddenly he seemed to re- 
member the athlete beside him, star- 
ing with mouth agape. Demunth 
skewered Yarn with the black eyes 
which were a part of what had 
earned him the nickname he ^ecretiy 
loved: Demon. He heaved' a great 
breath and spoke again in his nor- 
mal voice, a steel file drawn over 
concrete block. 

“Listen, you impossible fool, I’m 
sorry I ever pointed out those blasted 
offworlders to you. A swordsman’s 
got no business filling his eyeballs 
with gods and his mind with ice 
cream. Listen, you twice-dropped 
idiot I Those fellows are poison. 
Poison! You’re not to look at them, 
d’you understand? Think of the 
stories you’ve heard — offworldeis 
may look like us and act like us, but 
any Consumer can see they’re more! 
How else d’you explain to me why 
cviery mortail on Solitos lives in dafly 
awe and, yes, terror of the off- 
worlders? I’d have been deaded long 
ago with one of their zaptubes if I 
weren’t so valuable. They live for 
these games; they say they influence 
the destinies of planets and stars, and 
the man hasn’t been born who^s bet- 
ter at the Tourneys than I!” 

Yarn walked by his side, hardly 
feeling the coach’s impossible grip 
on his bicep, listening and thinking 
as the old stories of men who had 
achieved the powers of gods came 
again into his brain. Men whose 
wealth could be measured in stars, 
who had machines and unhuman 



SWORDSMAN OF THE STARS 



97 




braim to diink how they could hold 
on to that wealth and continue con- 
stantly adding to it, who had lesser 
men and lesser beings to do every- 
thing for them — including die. 
These were the men whose lives 
were worth more than entire worlds 
of athletes. These were the men 
who came annually to Solitoe. 

“It*d be great to be a god or the 
son of a gy wouldn’t it Vam? Ride 
around in the big ships, travel be- 
tween the stars, bed any female you 
fancied? Wouldn’t it? Yes, look at 
him nod his empty head! Son of a g! 
Forget it, you idiot. There’s only one 
goal you’ve got to have in life — 
that’s staying alive! Fail, and you’ll 
be just like that Bluechip killer you 
dropped . • drogfood!” Demunth 
jerked his head. ‘^Hcre, you thick- 
skulled Commiel The truck’s waiting. 
Scuttle!” 

V am scuttled. Through the exit- 
gate, past loud-mouthed specta- 
tOTB and into the truck hovering a 
scant three feet above the pavement. 
The other athletes were all on their 
rows of seats awaiting their ride to 
Demunth’s territory, and the truck’s 
pilot was there wearing his zaptube. 
Vam raised his eyes to the distant 
gold-and-platinum towers of the Off- 
world Hotel, wondering what luxu- 
riom quarters he would now retire 
to had he been bom a sag-gutted 
Businessman or eletced a Financier 
on Brinap. 

••By the way,” Demunth con- 
tinued, climhing into the truck with- 
out seeming to notice the sweat and 
blood of his charges and the once- 
sharp crease in his trousm, ”1 no- 

98 



ticed you had sense enough to re- 
member what I’ve said when those 
three nervewhip and guthook boys 
tried to climb you. Special cut of 
drog tonight . and a little talk. 
Subject: alertness.” 

Yarn nodded, pleased; aaother 
compliment, no matter how tangled 
in criticism it was, and the special 
cut of meat was a reward. So was 
the “talk.” When a promintng ath- 
lete demonstrated his weak point 
Demunth practiced with hini person- 
ally, calling it a “talk.” 

“Oh,” Demunth added as the truck 
started moving, “and Doc’ll have an 
extra needle for you tomorrow. 
You’ll not have to worry about that 
porkfaced financier’s medallion 
again!” 

Yarn nodded in silence. Despite 
his explosion, then, Demunth would 
not mention the illegal trick against 
his boy. This bore out the truth of 
the Qffworlder’s inviolability; if De- 
munth wouldn’t attack them, no one 
would. 

Yam thought about it all the 
way to his dorm. When the truck 
lifted over the wall and into the 
campus, he hardly saw the rectangu- 
lar building with its many little cells 
opening into a central court. What 
he saw beneath his own eyelids was 
far more colorful. 

11 

I n his own small cell Yam turned 
to his cot, waiting for a masseur. 
Offworlders! And Prince Hannanook 
in particular — why had that great 
man intervened in the life of a mere 
athlete? Why would a g or the son 

IF 




of a gf as Demunth termed them, 
care about such as he? Because the 
prince had part of an industry or a 
planet staked upon him? Probably, 
and yet — Varn stared at the ceiling 
and thought about it. When the mas- 
seur came and attempted small talk 
on how Yarn’s fight had gone, Varn 
ignored him. The rubbing and 
thumping and kneading made him 
think only of the way godlings had 
lesser men attending to their every 
need. Godlings did not condescend 
to notice the hands that served them. 

By the time his food came Yam 
felt he had about solved the weighty 
problem of Offworlders. His con- 
clusion was one he was not likely to 
share — and yet one that he must 
share eventually. As he watched the 
loinclothed serving man load his 
table with a generous fighting-ration 
of drogflesh, fresh weeds and red 
slorp in an athlete-sized drinking ves- 
sel, he saw clearly what he had never 
dared see before. He tore at the 
meat, noting it was prime rib this 
time, and fatless. The coach thought 
he’d be champion! Surely he did! 
No trainer could know what made 
one athlete a champ and another 
drogmeat to serve the drogs to serve 
the better athletes; but he had twice 
spoken words of compliment, and 
now he would train Varn personally. 
Varn grinned. 

Perhaps Demunth would teach him 
the trick that only Demunth was 
reputed to have mastered, the trick 
of switching hands on shield and fire- 
sword in midfight. Still grinning, he 
raised the vessel to wash down the 
last bite and saw Demunth gazing 
at him from across the table with 



a strange expression on his broad 
face. Demunth’s face appeared to 
have softened everywhere except for 
his brass nosering. 

“You godling it, Varn?” The train- 
er’s voice was rough as usual, yet 
managed to hold a note of under- 
standing. It was as though the coach 
had been standing there, seeing him, 
partly seeing himself as -a very young 
and very promising athlete. Vam 
read the envy and respect for his 
youth in those few words, and then, 
unable to stop himself, he rushed out 
with it: 

“Offworlders . they do couch 
a Consumer now and again, don’t 
they? I know that freemen do. I’ve 
often heard freewomen shout invi- 
tations. I’ve often thought my sire 
might be a free citizen who sells you 
red slorp or swords, but not till to- 
day have I thought I might be — ” 

“Blast you! You never had a 
father, you beanbrain! You haven’t 
got that fat financier and that spin- 
dly-armed prince out of your head, 
have you?” But the scathing diatribe 
was an invitation to Varn to say 
more. 

“Coach, today a Boardchairman of 
Boardchairmen’s son warned me. 
Why would he do that, unless he 
thinks me more important than 
others? Why, Coach, unless . 

“Doesn’t it occur to you that he 
probably stood to profit? Somebody’s 
got to stay alive to meet Probin, and 
. ump. Look here, d’you think 
you’d fight better if you were the 
same blood as that Offworlder?” 

Varn was elated to realize that 
Demunth saw him as the jock to 
take Bluechip Probin. But his dation 



SWORDSMAN OF THE STARS 



99 




did not stop him from answering ex- 
citedly: “Yah, Coach, yahl” 
Demunth rounded the table, and 
his heavy hand came down on Vein’s 
shoulder with a jar that forced him 
to stiffen his knees. “Well, then, 
believe it, athlete! Believe you’re 
Prince Hokeyhokey’s hidden brother. 
He got all the brains and riches and 
power. You got all the muscle and 
gristle and skill.” 

Vam believed. 

H e believed through that evening’s 
practice when he almost singed 
Demunth’s nose and heated his nos- 
ring. He believed, as he went to sleep 
bone-tired. He believed, as next day 
the medic injected him with the 
usual pain-depressant and stimulant 
and added another shot , while De- 
munth stood by and taiked about 
how he must never look directly at 
anything in the hands of a spectator; 
and Vam felt an instant of disorien- 
tation, as if he’d just awaked, and 
saw the others were forming up for 
the ceremonial march into the sta- 
dium. 

He believed, as he fought that 
afternoon in the all fireswords free- 
for-all. He believed, the following 
day when he fought the big Dark- 
horse krats and the giant wild 
houggs and other Darkhorse beasts 
that may or may not have had Earth 
ancestry^ He believed, and he fought 
so well he gained more and more 
attention from the stands as his bet- 
ting odds continued to accelerate; 
some cheers were for his opponents, 
but more and more the uncommitted 
cheers were for the believing gladi- 
ator, Cut off from his Greenback 

100 



teammates in a Greenback-versus- 
Bluechip rumble and battling six 
Bluechips at once, he heard fiancier 
Curth cheer the Bluechips; and he 
believed and fought as a god must 
fight, knowing he must possess god- 
blood. 

When a huge Darkhorse krat with 
teethlike daggers bestrode him, pin- 
ning his right arm and coming for 
his throat, then did Varn hear the 
senator’s delighted “Kill, Krat! Eat, 
Krat!” And the counter-cheers of 
“Go Athlete,” from the prince and 
the senator’s own sec’y; then did 
Varn find a courage and strength 
that was surely immortal. He 
grabbed the monster krat’s slavering 
tongue with his own teeth and bit 
and chewed with all the strength of 
his jaws while he drew his firedagger 
with his left hand and plunged it 
deep and flaming into the animal un- 
til its guts sizzled. 

Varn believed, and he survived, the 
second and third days of the tourna- 
ment. That evening as he rested after 
the fights and felt truly godlike, he 
looked from his athlete’s cell and 
saw a liveried Consumer in the act 
of handing Demunth a message. 

The coach’s broad face went slack 
as he read. Then it tightened, dark- 
ened so that the hosering seemed 
to brighten by contrast. “NO! By 
Lenin and Marx’s very vitals, NO!” 
And he struck the Consumer a blow 
that stretched him at his feet. De- 
munth glanced in Varn’s direction 
and strode away. Eventually the 
Consumer staggered up and limped 
off. Later stiU, Varn watched as 
freemen in the same orange-and- 
black costume came into the walled 



IF 




dorm. With the rods of death in 
their (belts they spoke to Demunth. 

Viam saw their glances as they 
talked and knew they spoke of him. 
He recognized their colors: the box 
of Financier Curth of Brinap had 
sported them daily. Did the financier 
want to buy him, perhaps, in mid- 
tourney? Transfer him to the Green- 
backs so that he and Probin would 
never have to clash? He watched 
from the back of his cell until the 
men left. Then Demunth came to 
his cell. The coach’s face was grim as 
winter sunset, and his black eyes 
did not look directly at the athlete. 

4 4 A sleep, Yarn?” 

/I “Nah, Coach.” 

“Yarn, there are powerful men 
who hold as much power over me 
as I hold over my boys. D’you un- 
derstand, Yam?” 

“Yah, Coach.” 

“Well then, by Marx you under- 
stand more than II ‘Yah, Coach!’” 
He swore for at least a full minute. 
Then: “When such a powerful man 
wishes something from me, I haven’t 
the power to refuse. Not even I, 
Demunth! But even when his wish 
is evil, Yarn, and illegal as well, I 
am powerless. Do you — ” 

“I understand. Coach.” Yarn wait- 
ed. 

“Tomorrow you will fight in the 
preliminary bouts to decide who will 
fight in the final battle of cham- 
pions. Freemen with zaprods will 
watch. Forty pair of Bluechips and 
forty of Greenbacks will battle back- 
to-back to the deaths of all save ten. 
Yarn, at your back you should have 
one of the best fireswordsmen I 



possess.” Demunth stopped abruptly 
and touched his forehead to the 
grilled door. Yarn focused on his 
trainer’s nosering. 

“Yarn, your partner will be a 
trainee. A good one, but far from 
the best and unblooded and unbroke 
to fire. If you’re to survive you’ll 
have to kill your opponent very 
fast and then face your partner’s 
opponent. If your partner is killed 
first your chances of surviving him 
are about the same as your being 
Boardchairman. 

“Then . then I’ll fight for both, 
Demunth.” 

Demunth’s head came up; athletes 
did not call him by name. But he 
said nothing. His position had 
changed, and both knew it. He 
nodded once, then walked away. 

Yarn stared up at the ceiling. Fin- 
ancier Curth of Brinap wanted him 
dead. Why? Could it be resentment 
— could Curth resent the existence 
of such as Yarn with Off world 
blood? Perhaps some of these god- 
lings rejoiced in destroying such . • 
their kind? Was it letter, if one 
were a god, to watch a god die than 
to watch a man? He fell asleep 
thinking about it, because no matter 
how tiued the athletes were at day’s 
end, their supper-wine contained a 
slow and shortlived anesthetic. 

B ut the anesthetic did not control 
Yarn’s dreams, and they were 
not good. 

Reality was little better. The shak- 
ing youngster at his back next day 
barely knew which end of the fire- 
sword to grip. The scores of orange- 
and-black athletes who had been 



SWORDSAtAN OF THE STARS

overwhelming Yarn in his dream 
until he awoke sweating . • they 
were not necessary. With such a 
partner as he had drawn not even 
a godling — hut that he must re- 
memherl He was a godlingl Son of 
a gy yesl He who had survived the 
great krats and the nervewhips and 
electrotridents of three simultaneous 
attackers, and the murderous free- 
for-all. He must remember. 

“Use your shield,” Yam said over 
his shoulder. “Turn his blows; don’t 
bother to try to attafck him. I’ll soon 
turn to help you.” But his partner 
was shaking so that Yarn wondered 
if he heard. 

At the first clash of fireswords he 
knew his opponent was a profession- 
al. His tightset mouth was merely 
one more seamed wound in his face. 
He had survived a dozen tourneys. 
He had been judged Champion, pa- 
raded around the stadium seven times 
while the spectators cheered and 
screamed in hysteria; and for the 
next several months Scarface had 
been rewarded with his pick of 
women from the breeding pens. He 
was Probin. 

Yarn parried his first flaming 
blow and his second and his third, 
and then from behind him he heard 
the unmistakable sigh that signaled 
a hot sword in the smoking vitals of 
his partner. 

Yarn’s life expectancy was re- 
duced to seconds. 

He didn’t wait. He threw himself 
wildly aside and blocked Probin with 
his s^eld and scrambled desperately 
to avoid the thirsty sizzling sword 
behind him. He had one hope: that 
the Bluechip who had slain Yarn’s 



partner had a partner very much in 
trouble. 

From the stands Finaodef Ouith*8 
voice bellowed “GO BLUEOHIPr 
Yarn roared *1DIE BLUECHIP,” 
and swung a tremendous chop at Ids 
opponent. Scarface was too ex- 
perienced to die in such a way, but 
the swing saved Yam’s life; the 
firesword from behind which had 
been aimed at his neck betwixt hel- 
met and cuirass sparked off his 
armored back. Then Probin had to 
half turn to face the Greenback 
who’d just downed his partner, and 
Yam followed his example and 
caught his opponent wide open. He 
jerked his sword free and looked 
about desperately for a new partner. 
He spotted a lone Greenback and 
made for him, noting that the ath- 
lete’s left cheek was leaking blood 
and he had a patch of mail missing 
and an ugly burn over his right nip- 
ple. 

^C^T^eammate!” Yarn yelled, bare- 

X ly hearing his own voice 
amid the shouts and screams of other 
athletes and the crash and clang of 
steel on steel and the roar from the 
stands. Between them moved a pair 
of Greenbacks battling a single Blue- 
chip. Yarn struck down the Blue- 
chip and again shouted “Teammatel” 
and charged around the Greenbacks 
to his new partner. 

Yam’s arm was numb and his 
blade sizzled with the smoking blood 
of six athletes when the gong rang 
to end the combat. He jerked back 
his firesword to hold it rigid at his 
right shoulder. He glanced around, 
keeping his eyes up to see the living.

IE 




and not the dead and dying. He 
was astonished; he was one of four 
surviving Greenbaciks. Probin was 
among the remaining Bluechips. They 
stared at each other. Then they were 
raising their flaming swords to the 
audience as the man who’d been at 
Yarn’s back for over an hour said, 
“Well paired!” in Yarn’s ear. 

Yarn felt star-scraping tall. He 
heard his name, among others. They 
knew him by name, now! Somehow 
he was unable to take his eyes off 
Financier Curth; somehow his legs 
carried him across the bloodsoaked 
turf to gaze up at the fat creature’s 
box. He jeered me. Yarn thought. He 
booed. He forced Demunth to try 
to have me killed. Yarn did not 
shout. A shout would have been a 
ripple in the mighty ocean of ap- 
plause and screaming. Yarn waited. 
He was a godling; Curth was deign- 
ing to ignore him! But he could not 
forever — and did not. The finan- 
cier from Brinap looked down at 
the blooded and scorched athlete 
eight meters below his box. 

And slowly and very coolly Yarn 
raised his right hand to his nose 
and wriggled his fingers at the fin- 
ancier. 

Ill 

C urth came upright like a starship 
from atmosphere. He pointed, 
his mouth moving. Beside him one 
of his retainers stood and yanked a 
zaptube from his broad belt. As he 
raised it, the financier’s sec’y squeal- 
ed and slapped at his arm. Curth 
cuffed her in the face, and Yarn 
remembered that it was she who 



had chTeered him. She dropped back 
into her seat, hand to her cheek, 
and the freeman raised the tube 
again. 

Yarn had not seen Prince Han- 
nanook give his order, but he must 
have; one of his purple-and-gold re- 
tainers appeared beside Curth’s box. 
His zaptube was aimed at the man 
who was preparing to loose invisible 
radiation at Yarn. Curth’s man sat 
down. Curth turned and his mouth 
moved as the prince’s did, the 
voices lost in the noise from the 
crowd. Then the financier dropped 
back into his seat with a jiggling of 
his chins. 

Ignoring his shaking knees. Yarn 
raised his red-streaked firesword 
nearly to his lips, his . eyes on the 
imperial prince. Hannanopk smiled 
and nodded his head. Yarn turned 
and left the stadium, keeping him- 
self from breaking into a run with a 
tremendous effort. 

Demimth reproached him — if 
such a gentle word could be used 
to describe anything the retainer said. 
“There’s no hope for you now, 
idiot!” 

“Was there before. Coach? He’s 
determined to destroy me.” 

The perpetual scowl deepened on 
the broad, ugly face. “There’s no 
accounting for the actions of mighty. 
Yarn. If you were a freeman — ” 

But Yam knew he was infinitely 
more. He was about to tell the coach 
as much when an air-raft landed in 
the campus and several freemen 
stepped off and approached. Yarn 
recognized their bumble-bee livery. 

Demunth saw them and walked 
away. They called to him. Yarn 



SWORDSMAN OF THE STARS 



103 




watched them exchange words, 
watched Demunth shake his head 
and heard his voice rise. The Brinapi 
financier’s freemen gesticulated and 
evenutally accompanied Demunth to 
his quarters. The coach’s shoulders 
seemed to sag. 

His ibrows drawn down in worried 
thought, Yarn had just stretched 
out on his bunk when he looked 
up at his square of barred dusk and 
found it filled with Demunth’s bulk. 
He got quickly to his feet as the 
outside bar was lifted. 

Demunth bore a goblet. “Wine, 
Yarn . special ration because of 
tomorrow’s championship fight I” 

Yam had never received wine be- 
fore, only the vitamin-loaded sweet- 
ish imitation: red slorp. He took 
the shiny metal flagon from De- 
munth’s mysteriously shaky hand and 
started to raise it eagerly. 

T hen his eyes saw the shadows 
well behind Demunth. Curth’s 
freemen! Yarn looked in Demunth’s 
eyes. Then he nodded his head, 
stepped back into his dormitory cell 
and raised the cup. He made ap- 
preciative gurgling and smacking 
sounds as he carefully allowed the 
wine to run down his chin and onto 
his smock. He knew Demunth saw, 
was sure the others did not. 

“Thank you, Coach!” He handed 
the cup hack to his trainer. 

“Sleep well, athlete,” Demunth 
said and went away with the men. A 
little later the flying platform arose 
into the air and slid away. Demunth 
returned, and his ugly face gazed at 
Yam’s a few moments before he 
cleared his throat. 



“You showed wisdom. Yarn. But 
what good will rejecting his potion 
do you? You will ie tomorrow, just 
as surely. He will find a way.” 

“Die? I want to win the champion- 
ship for you. Do you doubt I can?” 
"'Win! Why you addle — all right. 
Yarn, I’ll open my shield to you. 
No, until I learned what an enemy 
you have, I really thought you could 
win. Today you somehow held off 
Probin and eluded the man at your 
back and accounted for eight, I 
think. But . no. Yarn. Not now. 
The Solitonese hasn’t been born who 
can stand up to me. But an Off- 
world financier is another matter. I 
believe that you can win . but 
that you will die because the fi- 
nancier wills it.” 

“You said before that if I were a 
freeman things would be different. 
Yet I can become one only by win- 
ning, by fighting out of here, as you 
did. Coach. This I will do. And I 
will win tomorrow ... for you and 
for me.” Yam’s mind had never 
worked so furiously in his life. “Prac- 
tice with me. Coach, that I may be 
the best on the field tomororw.” 
Behind the square roof of the ath- 
letic quarters a yellow moon, fat 
and round as Curth’s belly, was 
rising. Its pale fingers of light 
touched Demunth’s face. The face 
was set, determined, afire with the 
hatred the trainer felt for the mighty 
financier. The frog’s mouth was held 
taut against Demunth’s teeth. Then: 
“By the Ultimate Banker’s fat 
paunch, I will! Get your gear. Yarn. 
Come along!” 

Yarn nerved himself, swallowing 
hard, as the bar was dropped. What 



104 



IF 




he had decided upon only a godling 
could do ... a godling who would 
have to wield a hetter sword than 
the fabled Demunth. He went with 
the coach to the field house and 
equipped himself. Did Demunth have 
any idea, he wondered, that this time 
there was more than mere coach- 
and-player exercising involved? 

No, he thought as he faced the 
firesword and shield of Demunth! 
No, the coach did not know. For 
who could guess that such an im- 
possible dream could fill the whole 
being of a lowborn athlete? Who 
could imagine that a man born a 
Consumer could find such deter- 
mination, could think the unthink- 
able? Poor Demunth, Yarn thought. 
He does not really believe I have 
god-blood! 

T hen Demunth moved so fast that 
Yarn was almost caught un- 
ready. The man who had trained a 
thousand athletes pressed his oppo- 
nent hard and struck for the throat 
with the extinguished flat of his 
sword. Yarn blocked just in time, 
knowing that had the firesword 
been switched on he’d have 'been 
scorched. Had he been an instant 
slower, he’d have been decapitated. 

“Little slow, athlete. Faster now 
— let’s see how fast you can block.” 
Yarn’s shield rang without spark- 
ing to a shower of swordblows. It 
was all he could do to stop them. 
Never in competition had he faced 
such an onslaught from a single 
source. The coach was yielding up 
to his anger at the financier; he’d 
sweat it off hacking at Yarn. And 
Yarn? He felt tears close behind his 



eyes. Could he do it? Would he be 
able to do it? Could he possibly bring 
himself to kill diis man who was 
the nearest thing to a father he 
knew? Oh no! Stop me, he thought. 
Kill me, Demunth! Don’t let me kill 
you! Don’t make me! I am so new 
at being a god! 

When Demunth stopped, he was 
not even winded*; “Now you try. 
Yarn.” He stepped back and grinned 
his ugly grin as Yam tried. He drove 
in to smash past Demunth’s guard. 
As always, he failed. Could this be 
the arm of a god-man, this arm 
which could not steer a sword past 
a mortal’s shield? He wanted to kill 
him quickly — he had to, if he was 
to do it at all. But Demunth’s sword 
and shield changed places with a 
praticed motion that imitated the 
lightning in its speed, and he at- 
tacked. Yarn was forced to retreat. 
Never had he seen anyone else who 
could unlock his hands from his 
weapons, slip them one across the 
other and continue fighting without 
missing a stroke. There was no other 
undefeated coach. Demimth stood 
alone. Yam’s thumb was near the 
powerswitch of his pommel. 

F or the first time since he had de- 
cided what he must be. Yarn 
had dou^bts. And then his golden 
throne toppled. He could not do it! 
He could not defeat the undefeated 
and quite possibly undefeatable 
coach. 

“In three years, Yarn — maybe 
two — you’ll be as good as I! But 
now ... I haven’t time to teach you 
better attack methods.” Demunth 
was panting a little as he spoke. 



SWORDS/AAN OF THE STARS 



105 




Was there sadness in ins voice? Did 
he merely regret his inahility to put 
the final edge on the finely-honed 
blade that was Vam, or . .? 

So he would not have to think, 
Vam tried to lightning-switch with- 
out flaming his blade. He nearly 
dropped his shield. “Better not try 
that tomorrow, Boy,” Demunth said. 
“Your opponent would’ve got past 
your guard. Watch. I’ll show you 
again.” 

Sword flamed and winked with 
the shield in the moonlight as they 
changed hands. Again Yarn tried to 
imitate. If anything he was even 
clumsier this time. 

“Athlete, that won’t do! Watch 
me again — ” 

“Coach! Look.’ ” 

The shadow swept over the sand, 
a big dark rectangle. Both men look- 
ed up as the black shadow glided 
over the roof of the jockdorm. 

“Get out of here, Yarn. Run, 
damnit!” 

Yarn hesitated. Demunth was 
staring at the flying raft. His back 
was to his best athlete. There would 
neyer be a better opportunity for 
Yarn to do what he intended: strike 
down the coach, take his clothes 
and, most important of all, his brass 
nosering which proclaimed him a 
freeman. Then . attain the im- 
possible. Go to Financier Curth. 
Prove himself a god-man. Yarn’s 
firesword was in his hand; De- 
munth’s neck was unprotected . 

Yarn turned and fled as the coach 
ordered. To his left was the dorm, 
to his right the high wall surround- 
ing the practice field. It was closer. 
There was shadow, although not a 



great amount, since the moon was 
at the opposite end of the yard. 
Yam raced to the wall, flattened 
himself against it. He wondered if 
his armor gleamed. He waited. 

The raft landed, settling gently 
to the ground with a little hissing 
sound as the dust and sand swirled 
beneath it. There were three of them : 
black and orange. All stepped off the 
raft; all approached Demunth witii 
hands never far from their belts. 
This time Vam heard them clearly. 

“Take us to the cell of the athlete 
called Yam. We want to be sure he’s 
sleeping well,” one of them said, and 
another laughed. The snoring from 
the cubicles nearly drowned out their 
voices. 

“He’s all right. Why don’t you 
fellows go on down to the Red Krat? 
Ask for Vivara. She’ll fix you up. 
You needn’t worry about that ath- 
lete anymore.” 

The Brinapi shook hi head. “Or- 
ders. We’re to check. Then, friend 
Demunth, we’ll go and study this 
Vivara of yours. Come on, take us 
in.” 

Demunth’s voice was hard, ugly 
as his face. “Don’t call me friend, 
office boy. I rule a thousand athletes, 
provide a civilized way to settle im- 
portant arguments. You lick the soft 
white toes of a grafting — ” 

T he man didn’t give Demunth time 
to finish. He struck him across 
the face with a gesture dripping dis- 
dain. Demunth’s sword hung loose 
in his hand, and Yarn knew that the 
reaction that flamed it was complete- 
ly automatic; the short firesword 
swung up and plunged with an ugly 



SWORDSMAN OF THE STARS 



107 




hiss into the Offworlder’s stomach. 
The man staggered back into his fel- 
lows, staring down at the shaft of 
glowing steel and his fast-cooking 
intestines. Then, as the man started 
to fall, Demunth yanked the sword 
fr^. 

Then Demunth dropped. Sound- 
lessly, without raising his sword 
again. 

Varn swung his wide eyes to see 
one of the remaining two Brinapi 
freemen shove his zapstick back in- 
to his belt, kneel beside his friend, 
then look up at the third man and 
shake his head. The man got up, and 
the two of them walked toward 
the dorm. Behind them, two bodies 
lay on the sand beside an extinguished 
firesword. 

Varn crossed the space from wall 
to Demunth without a sound, a dark 
shadow cutting a lighter one. His ex- 
amination was brief and simple — 
the coach was dead. So was the 
other man; his blood had almost 
stopped flowing from the cauterized 
wound the sword had made. Varn 
started to rise, then glanced back 
at the dead Brinapi. He bent and 
pulled his zaptube from his belt. 
Then he followed the other two, 
carrying the rod gingerly; he had 
never before held one of the short 
metal cylinders with its easily de- 
pressed trigger similar to the one on 
his swordhilt. His firesword was in 
its sheath, his shield still on his 
arm. 

He had time only to leap aside 
into the darkness beside the gate 
as the two freemen and a dormitory 
guard boiled out. 

“Jn that case he’s got to be out 



here still,” the guard said. He said 
nothing else. Vam’s action was al- 
most reflex; he brought the tube up 
and pushed the little thumbstud and 
swung the rod back and forth. Ten 
feet away, the guard and one of the 
freemen dropped like the corpses 
they undoubtedly were. The third 
man whirled, glanced down at them, 
peered at the sharows enveloping 
Varn. Then he turned and fled. 

Varn aimed the zapstick and 
thumbed it again. He swung it, spray- 
ing death. The organge and black 
tights kept running. Varn watched, 
mystified. How was it that the tube 
killed some, allowed others to live? 
Suddenly he realized he was a dead 
man; the Brinapi would sail away 
. and return with help. 

Varn dropped the useless rod. He 
had one chance, and he was out of 
practice; a man did not often use 
this trick in the stadium. As the 
freeman’s feet thudded onto the raft, 
Varn grasped his shield by the edge, 
curling his fingers. He took a deep 
breath, held it, turned half around 
and, exerting all the strength in his 
legs and arms, sent the shield sailing 
across the practice field. Like a toy 
saucer-ship or an oversize discus, it 
cut through the air. The freeman 
looked up just as it reached him. It 
struck him full in the chest, driving 
him back off the raft. The shield 
clanged on the platform and rolled 
off onto the turf. 

Varn ran after it. 

T he man was alive. He was bleed- 
ing from the chest, but not 
seriously injured; and Varn was un- 
able to understand his immobility 



108

until he realized the fellow had hit 
his head as he fell. He hesitated a 
moment, then pulled the zaptuibe 
from the Brinapi’s belt and ran back 
to the two he had downed with a 
similar one. 

The radiation-guns left no external 
marks. There was nothing about the 
uniform Yarn pulled on to indicate it 
had been stripped from a corpse. He 
brushed dirt off himself and 
shrugged; the tunic was tight. The 
dead freeman had been built like a 
man. Yarn wasn’t a man; he was an 
athlete. 

He returned to the raft and Fin- 
ancier Curth’s unconscious office 
boy. Then he waited, thinking, 
thankful that there were no athlete 
faces watching him through the 
barred doors. Surely no Consumer 
could have originated the audacious 
action he planned! His momentary 
doubt was gone; he was more cer- 
tain than ever of his godhead. 

The freeman moaned, and his eyes 
flickered open. They looked impas- 
sively at the levelled tube, then 
swung to the firesword and widened. 
Yarn nodded. It was true, somehow 
this man was unaffected by the zap- 
sticks. Then he noticed something 
more, this Brinapi was not wearing 
a freeman’s nosering. He pondered 
this, wondering how freemen could 
prove they were not Consumers on 
the world the office boy had come 
from. 

Yarn raised the firesword to the 
other’s throat. He waited for the 
office boy’s fear to settle. Then Yarn 
began telling him, clearly and care- 
fully, exactly what orders this very 
special fireswordsman had for him. 



T he two highest-ranking guests at 
the Solitonese Tournament of 
Synthetic Dispute Settlement, Prince 
Hannanook and Financier Curth, 
were of course lodged in suites at 
the top of the finest hotel on the 
planet — sprawling collections of 
well lighted and lushly furnished 
rooms on the three-hundred-and-first 
floor. The shaking freeman with the 
firesword at his back made a sloppy 
landing on the roof of the hotel. 

“How do we get to the financier’s 
apartment?” Yarn asked. He poked 
with his firesword to facilitate the 
man’s reply. 

“Though that door,” the lackey 
said, pointing; and Yarn nodded and 
leaned on the sword without flaming 
it. 

As though he had merely stepped 
on a potentially dangerous insect. 
Yarn withdrew his sword out of the 
Brinapi’s back and wiped the blade 
on his colorful jacket before sheath- 
ing it. He went to inspect the little 
house the freeman had indicated. 
Yes, it contained a door, and another 
door, and another door and steps. 
Yarn made certain both doors re- 
mained unsecured and went over the 
edge of the roof. The balcony he had 
seen as they approached the hotel 
lay just below. The height and the 
faintly twinkling lights did not bother 
him; the lights were tiny and too 
far below for him to see the ground. 

A well padded lounge on the bal- 
cony cushioned his short drop, and 
he was forced to catch at the lounge- 
chair’s back as he bounced. He sank 
down in the darkness, realizing that

while the drapes were pulled across 
the double doors leading into the 
financier’s suite, the doors themselves 
were open. The voices inside were 
very clear to the new orange-and- 
black-encased athlete on the balcony. 

“ — you’re done, Financier! Why 
don’t you admit it? I haven’t the 
need for ostentation you have. My 
men conducted their inquiries with- 
out livery, in taverns and on the 
streets. I already knew that an inves- 
tigation had been called in the Fi- 
nancery to check over your records 
and either end the rumors of your 
misappropriation of Brinapi funds or 
impeach you. Now I’ve found out 
about a few of your debts. I say ‘few’ 
because I assume there are others.” 

“My dear prince, you can’t pos- 
sibly — *• 

“Please don’t use your Boardroom 
oratory on me, Curth,” the original 
voice cut in, and Yarn recognized 
it as Prince Hannanook’s. “Shall I 
tell you how much you have bet 
on a Bluechip named Probin? On the 
Bluechips as a team? Apparently you 
stand to make the money to repay 
all bets and do some buying if the 
Bluechips win tomorrow. And to re- 
place the money you’ve stolen from 
the people of Brinap if that scarred- 
face Probin wins. Eh?” 

“Be smart, Prince, everyone wants 
to do this sort of thing. Why else 
do people still insist on symbolic 
wars? We happened to be in a po- 
sition where we can settle official 
differences and add to our own 
fortunes on the side, so why 
shouldn’t we? A little grease here, a 
refined bit of pressure there, and 
. really, where’s the harm? The 



show will be just as good tomorrow, 
the results just as bloody, just as 
conclusive and war-preventing. The 
only difference will be that you and 
I — and it can be you as well as I

ter of official territorial lines hardly 
matters to anyone. Who cares what

don’t; I don’t. It’s all too theoretical.

4 4 T7inancier, you sound as though 

-T this entire bloody institution 
existed solely for the amusement of 
the upper classes. You know that 
isn’t so. These stadium fights are 
necessary. What would you do when 
there’s an unresolved dispute and the 
warhawks are circling each other and 
preparing to fight to the last drop 
of the next world’s blood* — go back 
to exploding suns and death-seeding 
planets? Wars aren’t practical any- 
more. The symbolic battles and wars 
have worked for nearly a thousand 
s.g. years. Would you really want 
to break the rules and risk destroying 
that?” 

“My dear prince, there hasn’t been 
a symbolic war that was an honest 
substitute for human fighting in cen- 
turies. Wars can’t happen anymore. 
People have become too civilized. 
They don’t care that much.” 

“I know the institution must not 
exist for your purpose, Financier. If 
it were up to me there’d be no 
training of killers. If it were up to me

be so irrational as to think that

violence on any scale was a necessary 
final arbitrator. These once purely 
athletic contests were degraded by 
your kind, Financier. Now you’re 
making them worse! Whose bright 
idea was it to introduce the dark- 
horse beasts last year — yours?” 

The prince’s voice firmed. “Fin- 
ancier, it’s been obvious to anyone 
with eyes and a mind that that 
Yarn athlete was the one to watch. 
So you tried to eliminate him, to 
help Probin. Yes, I know about it. 
First the hypnomedal. Then pressure 
on the coach. Then . what? We’ll 
see. If Probin’s as doped up tomor- 
row as I expect him to be, I’ll stop 
the fight and have him disqualified. 
And Yarn? What did you send him 
tonight? Drugs? Poison? Death?” 
“Majesty, I am sorry you are so 
nosy. The firesword Rocdn is hold- 
ing at your back will spit and cook 
your liver as neatly as an athlete’s. 
But I’d prefer not . I’d much 
rather you had an accident and fell 
off the balcony. It’s a long way 
down.” 

Yarn rose to his feet. The fin- 
ancier’s voice was full of confi- 
dence, and the prince’s gasp was 
proof that there was a firesword at 
Hannanook’s back. 

“You wouldn’t dare, Curth!” 
“Prince, there’s an expression so 
old we’ve forgotten its origin: You’re 
whistling in the dark. Come along 
over to the balcony, won’t you?” 

T here was silence as Yarn found 
the place where the drapes join- 
ed, and he inserted the end of the 
zaptube. Hannanook’s voice said, 
“No, Financier, I won’t. You’ll have 



a hard time proving an accident if 
I’ve a sword bum between my 
shoulderblades!” 

Yam peered through the widened 
gap between the drapes. Spawled out 
in a bubblechair, wearing a care- 
lessly open robe. Financier Curth 
gazed, smiling, up at Prince Hanna- 
nook. Behind the prince, a well 
honed blade levelled at his back, 
stood a man in orange tunic and 
black tights. Behind the financier’s 
chair was his sec’y, the blonde who’d 
cheered Yarn, her flower-petal mouth 
open wide as her blue eyes. 

Yarn made very certain the tube 
he held was pointed at the man called 
Rocaln, that none of its stream of 
death would touch the prince or 
the sec’y. A zaprod was noiseless; 
if it did not kill the man he would 
be forced to make noise as he leaped 
at him with his firesword. He de- 
pressed the trigger. 

Rocaln stiffened and then went 
completely lax and toppled over 
sideways. He crashed across a table, 
containing the leavings of the fin- 
ancier’s sumptuous dinner, with a 
terrible noise. Curth shot to his 
feet with a speed Yarn would not 
have thought possible for one so 
obese. Hannahook swung around, 
saw the dead man, then looked at 
the doors as Yarn entered. 

“By Earth, athlete! Haven’t you 
any sense at all? Thumbing your 
nose at lardbucket was bad enough 
. but coming here disguised as 
one of his office boys!” Hannanook 
was grinning as he spoke. “Tsk! 
Frightful! Unheard of! I am so 
shocked I’ll not even ask what be- 
came of that uniform’s owner.” He

turned back to Curth. “Sit down, 
Curth. You’re finished.^* 

The financier’s collapsing into his 
c!'uiir indicated his complete agree- 
ment, and Hannanook smiled. But 
Yarn remembered his own tactic of 
falling only in order to get beneath 
his opponent’s armor. No, he’d not 
assume Curth was finished till the 
final buzzer. 

“Uh . Yarn,” the prince said, 
“you can point that thing at Financier 
Curth, but I do hope you won’t fry 
him. He has a long and brilliant ca- 
reer ahead of him ... as a prisoner, 
Td say.” 

Yarn swallowed. Suddenly he re- 
membered where he^ was, who he 
was, who these two men were. He 
found that no words would come to 
his lips. 

“Athlete Yarn, what possessed you 
to thumb your nose at this — at this 
charming old gentleman? What could 
possibly have possessed you to come 
here tonight?” The prince sat in a 
chair facing the financier, after pick- 
ing up the fallen Rocaln’s firesword. 
Both Hannanook and Curth ignored 
the body as if it did not exist. 

arn bit his lip. “I — I — ” 
“Take your time. Yarn. I’m most 
anxious to hear your answer,” Han- 
nanook said. And, without taking his 
eyes off the athlete, “Sit still, Curth. 
You’d better sit down, too, girl, be- 
fore you collapse. Just don’t do any- 
thing silly. I admit I’m a little soft, 
but this man suckled on a lyhon and 
teethed on a swordblade.” 

“Man!” Financier Curth snorted, 
and Hannanook turned to look at 
him emotionlessly. 

112 



“Getting your pose back, Finan- 
cier? Good for you ... I’d hate to 
have to find ten or twelve men to 
carry you out of here if you fainted. 
But just sit quietly, please.” The 
prince’s pale gray eyes returned to 
Yaim. 

“He — he just said it,” Yarn 
spoke slowly, frowning. “Man, he 
. wanted me dead ... so much. 
You warned me of death behind 
me. Then you stopped him from hav- 
ing me . zapped.” He stopped 
the hand that wanted to rise to 
scratch his head. “I ... I realized 
I was . am . something spe- 
cial?” 

“Special!” The financier exploded 
into laughter. His belly quaked. 

Hannanook ignored him. “Special? 
How? Why’d you come here?” 

Yarn said simply: “To kill him.” 
He lifted the zaptube. 

Financier Curth laughed. “Oh tell 
him the truth, Hannanook. That 
thing won’t kill me — my brain- 
waves are the wrong frequency. But 
it would kill you, athlete, and you, 
Hannanook.” The robe slipped all 
the way open on the right side, re- 
vealing the identical zaptube held 
in the pudgy hand. “As easily as 
this one.” 

Yarn depressed his weapon’s trig- 
ger. It grew faintly warm in his 
hand as he moved it from Curth’s 
left eye to his right eye to his 
amused mouth. He was careful that 
it did not come into alignment with 
the frightened girl, pushing her pretty 
face into the carpet at Curth’s right 
hand. 

“I told you it wouldn’t,” Curth 
said, still laughing. “Harmless to me

as the smell of blood. Of course if 
you wanit to try it on this sec’y . .?” 

“Master!” ^e girl protested. 

Vam eased up on the trigger. He 
looked at the vicious fat face and 
the beautiful pale one. Almost he 
thought to kill the girl to save her 
from the treatment she had been re- 
ceiving — and from Curth’s gross 
body. 

“You see, Vam,” Hannanook said, 
“you and I are — different. Some 
men had ancestors who originated 
from simple one-celled organisms de- 
veloped in a huge natural chemical 
caldron called an ocean. Other men 
had ancestors who were developed 
without prior stages of evolution — 
in an artificial vat in a man-made 
[^oratory. Our ancestors, Yarn — 
yours and mine — were of the lab- 
oratory type. Racially proud men 
such as Financier Curth call us — 
androids.” 

V arn looked at the prince and at 
the fat financier. “You too, Mas- 
ter?” 

“Just prince, Varn. Yes, me -too. 
Though how the financier discovered 
the fact — ” 

“Intelligence, Hannanook!” the fat 
man chortled. “Intelligence! Man has 
thousands of years of it to fall back 
on. He doesn’t need to exert him- 
self. Didn’t you know I’d take pre- 
cautions? I’m prepared. I don’t think 
your father will want it known that 
the royal bloodlines are android. As 
for your corpse — obviously an im- 
postor’s. People will say that I dis- 
covered the fraud and extracted 
quick vengeance for the real prince 
who was murdered by plotters. An- 



droids exist only to serve Man’s bid- 
ding. No one is going to want to 
aolmowledge androids as royalty — 
no one!” 

“Theire, Financier, you are wrong. 
As wrong as you were to gamble 
everything on Probin. The royal fam- 
ily of Aleria is about to become 
known as android and acknowledged 
as such. That’s tme whether you zap 
me or not. So don’t count on not 
being brought to justice — you will 
be.” 

Curth frowned. He didn’t look as 
though he’d ever laughed. His eyes 
locked with the prince’s, and Varn 
found his own eyes filled with those 
of the helpless sec’y. What a shame, 
Vam thought, that she and he and 
the prince could not somehow escape 
from here. Perhaps if he put himself 
between the prince and the Brinapi’s 
weapon. 

“You must not move, Varn,” Han- 
nanook said. “The financier needs a 
moment or two to decide to give 
himself up to me rather than face 
what he knows will happen to him if 
he commits a royal murder. The 
financier wouldn’t like what would 
happen to him then, Varn — no man 
would.” 

On Curth’s whitening face large 
drops of moisture appeared. Sweat 
coursed down his thick neck, crept 
from the dewlap beneath his chins 
and rolled unhe^ed into his robe. 

“You know, Varn,” the prince 
continued conversationally, “if the 
financier does make the sensible 
decision for once, I think I’ll give you 
a choice. You can defeat Probin in 
a fair fight, and I’ve a mind to let 
you. But if you are killed or badly

wounded through trying . then I 
won’t be able to use you for the 
further plans I have.” 

“Furthea: . plans?” Vam’s 
mouth felt dry. He wondered at the 
prince’s bravery. Surely only a god 
could be so calm while facing a 
zaptube. 

44X Tarn, in a short time there’s 
V going to be some serious 
fighting. I’m helping to arrange it. 
There’ll be some men of the original 
human stock involved. Men, Yarn, 
who haven’t done anything much 
more energetic in their entire lives 
than push buttons and instruct an- 
droids. Some of these men haven’t 
forgotten how to think, and not all 
of them think as Cupth does. It’s 
going to be a job training them to 
fight. Yam. That’s where you come 
in — you and a few other Solitonese 
androids. Your choice can be to fight 
Probin and win, and then come with 
me if you’re in condition to come. 
Or, if you prefer, you can try to en- 
list Probin. Enlist him to our cause 
and persuade him to go with lis to 
Aleria. Together, Probin and you can 
help train men. Train them not to 
put on a show. Yarn, or to settle 
things in a symbolic fight. Train 
them, rather, to deal efficiently with 
humans who have too long held con- 
trol of things. It will not be an 
android revolution. Yarn, it will be 
a human police action of the most 
necessary kind.” 

“You talk,” Curth said, “as though 
this tubespawn is something special 
to you. As though his life is of any 
more account than — than this 
sec’y’s.” 

114 



“You’re right, fat man. He’s spe- 
cial because he believes he is special 
and has acted as he thought a spe- 
cial man should act. As least one an- 
cestor of mine did the same thing. 
Financier, and maybe some of yours 
did also. A man is what he believes, 
not what his society or his culture 
would have him believe. He, not 
someone else. As for this girl, are 
you sure she’s not special? How do 
you know what she believes? When 
she grabbed your retainer’s arm and 
spoilt his aim before I could, that 
si^rised you, didn’t it? Didn’t it, 
Financier?” 

The financier’s eyes narrowed. A 
nerve twitched at the edge of his 
tight mouth. His nostrils pinched as 
he drew in a breath. 

The signs were unmistakable; 
Yarn saw a coward nerving himself 
for the deathstroke. 

Acting frpm reflex. Yarn propell- 
ed himself in front of the prince. 
Directly in front of the zaptube. 

At the same time a beautiful 
blonde head had arched above the 
chair-arm. Perfect white teeth flash- 
ed. A strong, young neck braced; and 
a slim hand with sharpened finger- 
nails came to the aid of the teeth. 

Yarn managed to change his full- 
armed athlete’s blow to a — for him 
— gentle slap. As the financier’s 
head rocked back, he shot out his 
left hand and snatched the falling 
zaptube. 

Moments later Yarn found himself 
staring at a stunned and defeated 
Brinapi financier with a reddening 
cheek and a torn hand. He did not 
stare at the financier long. The girl

T he Time Troller materialized 
with an audible pop. He was 
in a small but comfortable room, 
with a simple table, chair and bed, 
warm and well lifted. The only 
other occupant of the room was a 
small man, seated on a stool, his 
sparse hair combed forward over his 
high forehead, the dark eyes some- 
how vacant now as he studied the 
newcomer for a moment with little 
or no obvious interest, then casually 
looked away again. 

“Oh,” said the Time Troller a little 
peeved. 

He had been expecting a better re- 
action than this. He’d always had 
it before. He was an impressive fig- 
ure, after all; floating roughly a foot 
off the ground in the shimmering 
blue haze of his force-field, immacu- 
late in a silver-fitted, one-piece suit, 
with matching gauntlets and high 
boots. Most people did a bit more 
than just look away again. 



“Good morning,” he began tenta- 
tively. 

Suddenly the figure on the stool 
leaped to his feet, drew himself up 
to his full — if somewhat diminu- 
tive — height, his eyes blazing, and 
snapped, “Why do you not have 
even the common decency to bow 
to me?” 

The Time Troller bowed. Most 
handsomely. A rather sly smile 
flickered around the corners of his 
mouth as he did so. This was better, 
he thought, much better. At least he 
was getting a reaction, albeit a trifle 
unconventional. 

“Who are you?” 

“I am the Time Troller. Or at 
least, I am one of the Time Trollers.” 

“Idiot!” The man snorted con- 
temptuously. “You’re another char- 
latan after some money for your 
damn fool inventions. Well, I 
haven’t got any. Not now.” 

“Do I look like a charlatan?” 



The man seemed to take in the 
stranger’s surroundings almost for the 
first time. His jaw dropped. He sat 
down hurriedly and blinked. Then 
he blinked again. Then he shook his 
head, closed his eyes tight, opened 
them, blinked twice more, then 
groaned. 

“You’re not dreaming, you know,” 
commented the Time Troller gently. 
“Perhaps if I explained?” 

“It might be best.” 

The Time Troller beamed. He 
loved this bit. “I come from the 
future,” he said. “Millenia and mil- 
lenia in advance of your time. 1 
can’t give you an exact date because 
the calendar has changed utterly at 
least three times in between, and 
during the Times of Trouble they 
lost count completely. So although 
I’m honestly not sure what our date 
would be in your Christian timing, 
I should think it would be roughly 
32,000 A.D.” 

The man’s eyes seemed to be pop- 
ping out of his head, but the Time 
Troller continued unperturbed. 

“Time travel as such is an impos- 
sibility, of course,” he said. “None 
can travel back in time so as to 
be able to live in a previous age. All 
they can do is project themselves 
back in a sort of three-dimensional 
image, as you see me now. I am 
not really solid, you know.” 

The man jumped to his feeit as if 
to test this statement, but he was 
brought up short. 

“Don’t touch!” 

He stopped. 

“You must excuse my shouting, 
but it was meant as a friendly warn- 
ing. I may not be solid in the one 



sense, but I am definitely present in 
another. Had you put your hand, 
or anything, into my force-field, it 
would have disintegrated instan- 
taneously.” 

The man frowned. “What do you 
mean, disintegrated?” 

“Vanished. Disappeared. Phutt.” 
He grinned blandly. “Now let me 
continue my explanation. We can 
observe, comment, exchange con- 
versation, but not actually be present 
in the flesh. Not only that, but there 
is a time limit to our stay in any 
given place.” 

“A time limit?” 

“It does seem a little odd, doesn’t 
it?” the Time Troller replied cheer- 
fully, “A time limit in this context. 
But it’s true all the same. We are 
cast back, like a trawl, but when 
we arrive we cannot move from the 
one spot inside the force-field, and 
we are limited to half an hour. One 
of our half-hours, that is. It works 
out as about thirty-ifour and a quar- 
ter of your minutes.” 

“So you’re not here in the flesh?” 
The man seemed to accept the story 
readily enough. 

“No.” 

“And you can’t really influence 
events?” 

“Well, theoretically no. But it 
doesn’t always work out like that. 
For example, a Professor of Chio- 
nodynamy of my acquaintance found 
himself on Mt. Sinai by mistake one 
day as some poor Hebrew was look- 
ing for a lost sheep. The shepherd 
saw the force-field, thought it was a 
mirade — fire without burning, you 
see — and the result was that we 
nearly ended the Egyptian Empire of 



THE TIME TROLLERS 



117 




Rameses. The majority of the slaves 
left, you know. Most unfortunate.” 
He tut-tutted busily. 

“Did you say,” said the man, “that 
he found himself there by mistakeT 
“Afraid so, yes. You see, when 
you’re covering a period of nearly 
three hundred and fifty centuries, 
you often get miscalculations creep- 
ing in. A century or so is nothing. 
I’ve even forgotten now where he 
was supposed to be heading for. 
Whatever it was, there was conster- 
nation when he got back. But he 
couldn’t correct the mistake then.” 
“Why not?” 

“You can never go back to the 
same place twice. No one really 
knows why, but there it is. That’s 
allowing for the fact that if it were 
possible in theory, you’d probably 
end up somewhere totally different 
anyway. It’s all very disturbing. I 
wish they’d perfect the process. I 
mean, recently I was aimed for the 
last phase of the Martio-Jovian Com- 
mercial War of Era Three, and where 
did I end up? On Pluto. Smack in the 
middle of the Great Radiation. I 
spent the whole half-hour bored stiff, 
looking at bomb craters. Three and 
a half centuries out! Ridiculous.” 

The man looked suitably sym- 
pathetic. “Why do you do it?” 

“Do what?” 

“Go back in time? I mean, if you 
can’t be sure of exactly where you’re 
going, it seems a bit odd.” 

“We go back to troll for informa- 
tion, dear boy. To check up on the 
historical facts and make certain 
they were recorded correctly.” 

“Can you always understand the 
language?” 



The Time Troller allowed a su- 
perior smile to decorate his lips. 
“It’s all done automatically,” he said. 
“You could be speaking an3^hing 
from Vegan to Etruscan, and so 
could I, but to each other what we 
say seems to be spoken in our re- 
spective native tongues. I seem to 
speak your language, you seem to 
speak mine.” 

“Oh.” The man nodded. “Why 
are you here then?” 

“That depends on where ‘here’ is. 
I was meant to go to the United 
States in the mid-twentieth century.” 
The little man shook his head. 
“Oh dear,” he said, “I’m afraid 
you’re a little out. This is St. Helena, 
in the early nineteenth century, and 
I’ve been exiled here.” 

T he Time Troller looked at the 
man with new eyes. He saw the 
hand tucked idly into the waist- 
coat, the polished boots and the high- 
collared coat. “You mean to say that 
you are . .?” 

“Your servant, sir.” 

The Time Troller positively radi- 
ated joy. “Well, well, well,” he de- 
clared effusively, rubbing his hands 
together in enthusiasm, “we may be 
some way out, but it’s not often we 
get the luck to meet someone as 
eminent as yourself face to face. 
Marvellous. Marvellous.” 

“I’m very flattered. I don’t get 
much flattery these days. Not like 
the old days at all, you know.” He 
allowed his head to sink forlornly 
on his breast. 

“No, I hardly think it would be. 
It was the old days that I was think- 
ing of asking you about, actually.” 



118 



IF 




“Go ahead then. I’ll to help.” 
For a moment the Time Troller 
paused in his upsurge of enthusiasm 
and took a long cool look at this 
person. He frowned in some puzzle- 
ment. “You seem to be taking all 
this very calmly,” he said. 

The Emperor shrugged. “When as 
much has happened to a man as has 
happened to me,” he replied placid- 
ly, “so many unexpected ups and 
downs, twists of fate, nothing, how- 
ever new or unusual it might be, is 
going to surprise me very much.” 
The Time Troller shrugged in his 
turn. It sounded reasonable. Then, 
adopting his best interviewer’s pose, 
he stabbed his head forward ag- 
gressively. “Do you think your in- 
vasion of Russia was a failure?” 

The man smiled. “It ended in re- 
treat,” he said simply, “so what else 
was it but a failure?” He paused, 
then before the Time Troller could 
speak he added significantly, “Of 
course, it succeeded in the one re- 
spect.” 

“What respect was that?” 

“My real personal reason for in- 
vasion.” 

“To subjugate Russia, to gain 
glory for your country?” 

“No, no, no. Alexander was after 
Josephine.” 

The Time Troller sat up with a 
jerk. “I beg your pardon?” 

“The Czar of Russia desired 
Mme. Beauharnais.” 

“You’re joking.” 

“Joking? Do you seriously think 
I could joke over a matter so close 
to my heart, so deep, so wounding, 
so . .?” He paused, at a loss for 
words, and waved his hands in the 



air in expressive Gallic gestures. 
“That barharian, that holy-father 
milksop, with his pious notions of 
pseudoreligious nonsense, was mak- 
ing advances to my wife. I invaded 
his country to teach him a lesson.” 
The Time Troller shook his head 
in perplexity. “But you divorced the 
Empress some years earlier,”. jie said, 
“and married Marie Louise of Aus- 
tria.” 

The reply was a secretive smile. 
“A diplomatic trick, sir, to placate 
Joseph,” he explained airly. “Jose- 
phine and I remained lovers.” 

“And Alexander fell in love with 
her?’* 

“I wouldn’t dignify it with so 
honorable a name as love.” 

“But . but this wasn’t the rea- 
son for your invasion, surely?” 

“Are you calling me a liar?” he 
snapped, strangely impressive in 
anger despite his lack of inches. 
“What I am telling you is fact, no 
matter what history books may say 
in your distant times. I was misun- 
derstood in the past, my past, I am 
misunderstood now, presumably I 
will 'be even more misunderstood 
after my death. You, of course,” he 
put in witheringly, “would know far 
more about that than I would. But 
that was my reason for invading 
Russia, whether you like it or not.” 
“But this is ridiculous! This 
means that all the histories of the 
French Wars will have to be chang- 
ed. Motives of Empire — of the 
search for Glory — they’ll all have 
to go in favor of jealousy over a 
woman. I’d never have believed it. 
I’d always thought that . .” 

He broke off suddenly as the blue 



THE TIME TROLLERS 



119 




haze around him started flickering 
wildly. “Surely my time isn’t up 
yet?” 

“What’s the matter?” 

“That means I’m due to go back 
any second. But there’s lots more I 
want to ask you.” He stared round 
helplessly as his image started to 
fade, to blur and waver. The wall 
became visible through his body. 

“Can’t you come back and go on 
where you left off?” 

“I can’t, I can’t.” The anguished 
voice grew fainter, dulling into a hol- 
low whisper, an echo at the end of 
a long cavernous corridor that 
stretched for over thirty thousand 
years. “I told you, we can’t ever re- 
turn to the same place or time again, 
no matter how . .” 

H e disappeared with a pop, ex- 
actly as he had arrived. 

The Emperor looked at 4ihe spot he 
had occupied, then gingerly walked 
up and felt around to see if there 
was any trace. Nothing. Just a cer- 
tain freshness in the air, charged 
with negative particles, though he 
could not know this himself. He 
shrugged once more, extending his 
lower lip in a most un-imperial ges- 
ture of resignation, then sat down 
once more to consider the event. 

Some two hours later his door was 
opened, and two figures entered. 
They bowed deferentially. 

“Good morning, Emperor.” 

He gazed at them with singular 
lack of interest as they set down his 
tray of food and drink. 

“How are you this morning. Em- 
peror?” one of them 'asked solici- 
tOH^y. 



“As well as could be expected,” he 
replied. “Though my visitors at least 
do help to cheer me up.” 

“Visitors?” They stiffened. 

“There was a time traveller here 
this morning.” 

They relaxed, looked at each other 
and smiled sympathetically. “Oh, 
really? And what did he ask you 
about?” 

“About 1812.” 

“Your invasion? To avenge the 
insult to your mistress?” 

“Mistress?” he thundered pre-emp-’ 
torily. “My wife, man, my wife!” 
“My apologies, sire, your wife. 
Anyway, if this time traveller calls 
again, don’t forget to let us know.” 
“He won’t call again. They can’t 
visit ithe same place more than once.” 
“So we’ll never see him? Oh dear. 
Never mind. I’m sure he was suit- 
ably instructed.” 

“He was.” The Emperor smiled 
wickedly. “He said all the history 
books would have to be rewritten.” 
The two men smiled again, saluted 
the pathetic little figure sitting alone 
on the stool and let themselves out. 
The door was locked behind them, 
securely. 

“That’s a new one,” commented 
one of them, adjusting his white 
coat round him. 

“What, time travelling? Perhaps 
he’s going into a futuristic fantasy in- 
stead of the past. It would be a bit 
of a change from the same old 
thing, I guess. We’ve got far too 
many Napoleons as it is.” 

They walked on, through the au- 
tomatic swing doors at the end of 
the passage, out into the warm Cali- 
fornian sunshine. END

T/ie energy masters were criminals 
against my world. The trouble was 
in every important way — so was I! 



SYNOPSIS 



T hree of my friends had disappear- 
ed in a single small area of the 
Pacific, just north of Easter Island, 
Like me, all worked for the Power 
Board, the group which was respon- 
sible for rationing man's severely 
limited supply of energy and which 
was, because of that fact, practically 
the world government, 

Bert Wehlstrahl had vanished a 



year before, and Joey Elfven ten 
months later, Marie Wadetsky had 
gone two weeks after Joe, presum- 
ably in search of him, and I was 
principally interested in finding 
Marie, (Don't ask for my name; it's 
bad enough to have to listen to it 
occasionally, and I'm certainly not 
going to put it in print.) Since the 
two men were police workers of a 




121 





sort, it was likely that their disap- 
pearance was not accidental, so my 
first step was to search the ocean 
bottom in the key area from a cam- 
ouflaged vantage point — actually 
one of the spherical escape tanks 
used in ordinary cargo submarines, 
somewhat modified for my purpose. 

I found evidence of rationing vio- 
lation the moment I reached the 
bottom — / almost landed on it. A 
mile down there was an area actual- 
ly lighted artificially, and apparent- 
ly concealed under a flat, translucent 
surface which I interpreted as some 
sort of fabric. Seeing energy wasted 
to light the outside of a tent roof 
was bad enough; the sight of a 
swimmer in what looked like ordin- 
ary scuba gear under five thousand 
feet of sea water was far worse. The 
technological capacity so demon- 
strated . suggested something much 
more serious than an ordinary black- 
market energy gang. 

My tank was not very maneuver- 
able, but I managed to get myself 
**captured'* and towed to an entrance 
to the undersea base. Here I dropped 
a sonar transponder which should 
guide Board enforcement forces to 
the spot, released my ballast and 
headed for the surface with the com- 
fortable certainty that the swimmers 
could not follow far because of the 
pressure gradient. 

This belief proved wrong. One of 
them hung on to my tank and by 
pounding on it was able to guide a 
sub to the scene. After doing my 
best to get the 'nearly helpless tank 
away, I was really captured and 
dragged back to the bottom. 

The tank was brought to a lighted 



pit in the ocean floor^ There were no 
doors or air locks. The swimmers, 
who had loaded my tank with enough 
ballast to keep it down even if they 
lost hold again, towed me into a 
tunnel which led from the entrance 
pit, along it for a short distance, and 
into a flooded room. Then they re- 
moved their helmets. 

fter recovering, more or less, 
from the shock of seeing people 
breathing water, I got another one 
by discovering that Bert Wehlstrahl 
was among them. Communicating 
with him wasn*t easy; he could hear 
my voice through the walls of the 
tank, but couldn*t talk himself — 
reasonable enough if his vocal cords 
were trying to wriggle in water. He 
had to write his messages. He told 
me very little; I assumed that this 
was partly because of the communi- 
cation difficulty and partly because 
of the audience. He said that Marie 
was somewhere nearby, still in her 
sub, but that he knew nothing of 
Joe*s whereabouts. He also dropped 
a remark which forced me to revise 
my belief that he and the others 
were breathing water. They weren't 
breathing at all, as more careful 
observation showed. 

Also, the liquid around us wasn't 
water, but something denser. I re- 
alized that I should have spotted 
this from some of the maneuvers in- 
cident to bringing my tank '^indoors." 
On the new theory, it seemed that 
these people must be getting their 
oxygen from some food or drink 
which released it slowly and let them 
absorb Jt through the villi in the 
small intestine — the enormous pres- 




122 



IF 




sure made this seem at least possi- 
ble, though further data were cer- 
tainly needed. Bert would give no 
details. 

He said that I could stay and join 
them if I wished, or that I could 
return to the surface if I agreed to 
include certain information, which 
he would supply, in my report of 
the Board. Marie had been offered 
the same choice but had refused to 
make it — refused, in fact, to do 
anything until she was told what 
had happened to Joe. She didn*t be- 
lieve Bert's claim of ignorance, he 
said. 

After thinking it over, I agreed 
to stay, with some mental reserva- 
tions. I could obviously do nothing 
from inside the tank, but something 
had to be done — first about Marie, 
and second about getting this fright- 
ful flood of wasted power tied into 
the world energy net. The inside of 
the place was as brightly lighted as 
the outside. 1 would take my chances 
about being restored to air-breathing 
capability later. Bert had said it was 
possible, but I was beginning to 
wonder about Bert's reliability my- 
self. 

1 was unconscious during the 
change, which involved surgery. I 
woke up immersed in liquid, com- 
fortable enough, and with no urge 
to breathe. Bert and some of the 
*'natives" — with whom I had no 
luck whatever in communication, 
either by written language or signs, 
though they seemed to have a com- 
plex sign language of their own — 
accompanied me around the place. 
I saw Marie in her sub, and con- 
firmed Bert's report of her attitude. 



I went outside to the **farm" area 
for food, incidentally learning that 
the **tent" was merely the interface 
between the sea water above and 
the liquid in which we lived. I did 
not find out which, if any, of the 
vegetables we ate might be our 
oxygen source. 

Finally I was taken to see their 
main power installation, which was 
of course what I had wanted; I had 
expected to be kept away from it 
until they were more certain of my 
motives, but they showed no sign of 
suspicion at all. The generator was 
simply a huge crystal-heat engine, its 
high-temperature end far down in 
the rock below the sea bottom and 
its heat sink simply the ocean. It was 
all obvious enough — except, how, 
why and by whom it had been built 
under a mile of sea. 

There was also some doubt about 
what I could do about it, though 
none of course about what I should 
do; all these megawatts should ob- 
viously be feeding into the world 
power net and getting properly ra- 
tioned. I could make no plans which 
seemed at all promising, though. I 
was still wondering whether Bert 
were actually working under cover 
for the Board or had gone over to 
these power-wasters. I couldn't de- 
cide whether it would be wise to trust 
him with any ideas I did develop. 
This point was suddenly clarified — 
slightly. 

He had told me in so many words 
that he didn't know where Joe Elf- 
ven was. Now he took me to the of- 
fice of the power unit's director. Joe 
was inside, apparently in charge.

XVII 

T hat sight made a dhange in me. 

Bert had been a good friend of 
mine for several years. I had trusted 
him; Marie, admittedly, had not and 
had tried to get me to share her 
feelings, but I’d felt sure she was 
just brooding. 

A few minutes ago I had been 
jolted when Bert confessed to a false- 
hood in his earlier talk to me, but I 
had still been ready to listen to his 
excuses. I would even have been will- 
ing to believe that I had misunder- 
stood him the first time. 

But he had also told me — writ- 
ten it in plain words, with no pos- 
sible doubt about their meaning — 
that he did not know about Joe’s 
whereabouts and that to the best 
of his knowledge and belief Joe had 
never gotten to this place. 

Clearly and unarguably Bert 
Whelstrahl had been lying like the 
proverbial rug. He had known that 
Joe was here. He had known just 
where he was and what he was 
doing. Why should he tell such a 
lie to me and apparently to Marie? 
And having told it, why was he now 
bringing me face to face with the 
proof that he was a liar? And had 
Marie formed her impression by 
spotting some evidence I had missed? 

One thing was certain in my own 
mind. Whatever explanation Bert 
gave was going to have to be sup- 
ported by some pretty good indepen- 
dent evidence before I could accord 
it any weight. So was anything else 
he said from now on. 

These thoughts were interrupted 
by Joey’s pulling away from his 



viewer and catching sight of me. The 
expression on his face indicated that 
Bert hadn’t told him about me either. 
He was clearly astonished, and 
seemed delighted. He came over and 
shook hands violently, and seemed 
as frustrated as I was by the impos- 
sibility of talking. He looked around, 
probably for the writing pad, but 
Bert was already busy with the stylus. 
He held his words up for both of us 
to read. 

“Joe, we know you’re tied up for 
the next few hours at least, but will 
it be all right if I give you another 
assistant as soon as his first job 
is finished?” I appreciated his tactful 
skipping of my name and felt a 
little more willing to listen to his 
excuses when they came. I suspected 
from Joe’s quick grin that he ap- 
preciated it too; a few weeks away 
from our section hadn’t let him for- 
get my chronic embarrassment at the 
handle my parents had inflicted on 
me or my self-consciousness about 
all nicknames offered as substitutes. 

“More than glad,” he wrote. 
“Check him out as quickly as you 
can, Bert. We need him badly.” He 
came as close to slapping me on the 
back as the medium permitted, 
grinned once more and went back 
to his viewer. 

I would have liked to make more 
of a conversation out of it, but was 
coming to see how anyone who had 
been here long might start to lose 
the urge for idle chatter. I could even 
think of a few people who would 
be improved by such a change in 
residence. I waved a farewell which 
Joe didn’t see, and followed Bert 
back out into the control room. 



124 



IF 




I was going to put some pretty 
harsh questions to him, but he 
had the writing pad and circum- 
stances made it difficult to interrupt 
anyone else’s talk. He had stopped 
swimming and started writing by the 
time I got through the door. 

“I didn’t want you to know about 
Joe until after you’d had your talk 
with Marie,” were his words. “In 
fact, I only just decided to let you 
know even this soon. I don’t think 
she should know he’s here, and I’m 
quite sure he shouldn’t know that 
she is.” 

I grabbed the pad. 

“Why not? It sounds to me like a 
dirty trick on both of them.” 

“If she knows he’s here she’ll want 
to stay.” 

“What’s bad about that? You 
wanted me to stay, as you said, and 
I never denied she’s more decorative 
than I am.” 

“She Wouldn’t stay because her 
only reason for doing it would be 
Joe, and you know as well as I do 
how much good that would do her. 
You know he doesn’t care two cents 
for the kid. He chose to stay down 
here, remember. If she learns about 
him and stays, she’ll be giving him 
a hard time, and we can’t afford to 
have that happen. The job’s much 
too important. If he gets distracted, 
or changes his mind about staying 
here, it’s trouble.” 

“And why shouldn’t he know 
about her?” 

“For the same set of reasons. He’d 
know why she was here, and it would 
be as bad as though she were hanging 
around him in person. He never ad- 
mitted it, but I think she was one 



of the reasons he chose to stay here.” 
“You mean he disappeared on 
purpose? That he knew about- this 
place earlier?” 

“Oh, no. He got here just as I did, 
and as Marie did. He spotted a work 
sub that didn’t belong to the Board 
and followed it.” 

I pondered. The story had some 
convincing aspects; Joe’s attitude 
toward Marie was almost as well 
known as mine, though no one had 
ever convinced Marie of it. Few 
people had risked trying. Joey him- 
self wasn’t the sort of man who could 
tell a girl to run along, even if it were 
obviously the best thing for the girl 
as well as for himself. He’d feel it 
was somehow his fault for not falling 
for her. 

“But why should you have had 
to lie to me about it?” I asked final- 
ly. 

“Because you were going to see 
Marie, and I had some hopes you’d 
talk her into leaving. You’ll forgive 
my saying that if you’d known Joe 
was here you wouldn’t have been 
able to tell her that as far as you 
knew he wasn’t. I’m not belittling 
your acting ability, but you wouldn’t 
have ibelieved it was necessary then.” 
“I’m not sure I do yet. I’m still in 
the dark about this very important 
job Joe has to do and I’m supposed 
to help with.” 

“True enough. We’d better get on 
with your education. Library next.” 
“Will these guards, or whatever 
they are, be with us to the end?” 

“It’s hard to say. They aren’t 
guards, just people who are interest- 
ed. You ought to be flattered.” 

(Oh, I am. I’ve never been a ce-

lebrity before.” It’s curious how 
hard it is to convey irony by the 
written word alone. Bert missed it 
completely, as far as I could tell. He 
swam back in the general direction 
of the tunnel we had come down, 
and the rest of us followed him. 

A s I had guessed, the way up was 
along a different route — 
maybe I should say a different pipe 
— with the current, as I’d also ex- 
pected, carrying us up. 

As usual the trip was not enliven- 
ed by conversation, though I found 
it wasn’t too boring; the girl swam 
beside me instead of trailing behind 
with the others. As before, I didn’t 
know how long the journey took. 

I’m not clear how they controlled 
the current. It had carried us down 
one passage, it carried us back to 
the same room through another, but 
in the room itself there was no trou- 
ble in stopping. Bert opened the big 
door, and we shed our coveralls on 
the other side. Then he led the way 
once more. 

I was a little surprised, and a 
little more disappointed, to lose our 
escort at this point. They turned off 
into another tunnel a few yards from 
where we left the coveralls. No doubt 
they, too, had to work at times. I 
put them out of my mind, more or 
less, and followed Bert. 

This is one of the points where it’s 
hard to be detailed without being 
boring. A library is a library, even 
when it’s upside down. The books 
were ordinary in shape and style, if 
not in content. The films and cards 
were in no way remarkable. Like 
unballasted human bodies, most of 



them tended to float. The chairs, 
tables and carrels were on the ceiling, 
with racks under — no, I mean over 
— the chairs for parking ballast 
belts. Not everyone parked them, 
though; many readers had their belts 
still on as they drifted in front of a 
reading screen or floated with a book 
in their hands. 

The images on the screens were 
all of the general sort the girl had 
drawn on the writing pad, second 
cousins to electrical diagrams or 
grad-school topology exercises. I 
watched several of the readers for 
some ^minutes each and got the 
opinion that while they were reading 
in the same sense that the word 
usually implies, there was an impor- 
tant difference in technique. They 
did go page by page or frame by 
frame, as the case might be, spend- 
ing half a minute or a minute on 
each before going on to the next. 
But their eyes didn’t follow the 
regular back-and-forth routine of a 
book reader. They wandered ir- 
regularly over each page, like the 
eyes of a man examining a picture. 

Still, I reflected, that wasn’t too 
surprising. The same thing would 
happen to me if I were examining 
a wiring diagram. I was gradully 
coming to understand the situation, 
perhaps rather slowly by some peo- 
ple’s standards. I hadn’t thought of 
engineering drawings as a language 
before. 

B ert floated quietly around for 
several minutes, evidently will- 
ing for me to study the place by 
myself. At last, though, he beckoned 
me over to one end of the room. 



126 



IF 




There was an unoccupied film reader 
here, and a fairly large case of 
books. It took about two seconds 
for me to notice that these were 
written in ordinary lani^ges. Chi- 
nese • • • Urdu • • • Latin • • • Eng- 
lish • . Russian . • . I could recog- 
nize them all, even though I 
couldn’t read many of them. 

Bert started writing again. 

“This stuff yvill tell you the story 
much more quickly than I can. It’s 
no shock to you by now that a lot 
of people, not only Board workers, 
have foimd this place in the past. 
It’s been here since before there was 
a Board. A lot of diose people have 
stayed. Some of these books were 
brought here by them, some were 
written here by them. The informa- 
tion here is what convinced me of 
the things I told you — the business 
about attempts to get in touch with 
the Board about this place, and so 
on. 

“Spend as much time as you need 
absorbing it. It’s important that you 
get die whole story. I’ll be back when 
it’s time to eat.” 

He laid the pad under a chair — 
that’s not quite the right way to say 
it; the pad was denser than the 
liquid, so figure it out for yourself — 
and swam off. There seemed to be 
nothing to do but start reading. 

Now, I don’t have copies of those 
books and tapes. And 1 know Bert 
was a liar. But take my word for it, 
there were far too many of them 
for him to have product himself 
in the time he was down here. Most 
of them were handwritten, though 
some had been typed. I spent some- 
thing like eighteen solid hours just 



skimming the ones that were ia 
languages 1 iknew. (1 shoid^’t sa> 
solid hours. Bert did come jback to 
take me to meals, and I also slepi. 
There’s no point in describing all 
the details of life, even if the en- 
yironment did make some of them 
rather unusual). I’ll boil down the 
picture I got of the situation to the 
smallest volume I can manage. 

XVIII 

T he place had indeed been in ex- 
istence before the Board. Dur- 
ing the final few decades before ra- 
tioning, the separate political institu- 
tions which existed then were one by 
one coming to realize that man’s en- 
er^ reserves were indeed vanishing. 
A number of frantic attempts were 
made to avoid, or at least postpone, 
the consequences without offending 
public opinion — or rather, without 
disturbing public complacency. 

My own historical knowledge is 
shaky, but I seem to remember that 
this was the period of the “crash 
program,” which cynical engineers 
of the time used to define as an 
administrative attempt to produce a 
baby in one month by making nine 
women pregnant. You mi^ know 
some of the results, like Mediter- 
ranean-Dead Sea tiydrodcK^ilo |on- 
nel, the Messina, Key» On Bid Ai^~ 
fura dams, the Vidparaisdi Ibramo- 
couple, the Bandung pid Akoreyr 
volcanic taps. Some wo^ iv^e, and 
even valuable, some monuments to 
inept politics. 

You know the further conse- 
quences of some of them — the dis- 
putes over output use which led to a 



OCEAN ON TOP 



127 




dozen minor wars, which in turn 
wasted more energy in a year than 
all the crash units together could 
produce in a human lifetime. And 
you know that the final result was 
the formation of the Board and gen- 
eral acceptance of power rationing. 

During the period of friction sev- 
eral nations attempted to set up 
secret power plants, in the hope 
either of avoiding the covetousness 
of their neighbors or of providing 
themselves with energy reserves in 
case violent conflict did occur. Most 
of these “secrets” were secret only 
to the general public of the nation 
concerned long before they were 
producing — such of them as got 
that far. A few lasted for several 
years after Board rationing began. 
It had been assumed that the last 
of these had been found and tied in- 
to the general power net many dec- 
ades ago. 

But here was another. 

It was as simple as that — almost. 

1 didn’t find in the records just 
what country was responsible. I 
didn’t try very hard. The name 
would have been almost as meaning- 
less to me, born more than half a 
century after country names had be- 
come merely geographical labels, as 
it would have been to Abraham Lin- 
coln, who died probably twice as 
long before the nation in question 
existed. 

It was probably a small enough 
country to be worried about its 
neighbors, and certainly a large 
enough one to be highly industri- 
alized. The technique of deep-sea liv- 
ing which was being so effectively 



demonstrated to me at this moment 
was not la product of casual, or ev^ 
of crash-program, research. It must 
have involved a very long develop- 
ment period. Knowing something of 
the customs of the time, I’m still 
amazed that the secret was kept — 
though I can guess at the steps 
which in those days would have 
seemed normal and proper to 
achieve this end. 

Anyway, they set up the station 
and had it running nicely before the 
Board and rationing became a reali- 
ty- 

Remember, it was a secret. It had 
to be. Only a handful of people 
would have known about it at any 
one time, other than the thousands of 
permanent residents. That handful, 
when rationing began and all power 
sources became public property, 
simply and quietly withdrew from 
the world and severed connections 
with it. A little ruthlessness may have 
been necessary, but I prefer to be- 
lieve that the worst to happen was 
a little forced change of address. 

At any rate, there was suddenly 
a new nation with a population of 
about fifteen thousand at the bottom 
of the Pacific. It was well supplied 
with manufacturing and synthesizing 
plants, and over-supplied with ener- 
gy. Fifteen thousand people. As 
Marie put it later, fifteen thousand 
aristocrats — and more than fifteen 
billion Jacquerie. 

More realistically, fifteen thousand 
cut flowers. 

Most of the accounts I read ex- 
pressed, or at least hinted, the be- 
lief that the severance of relations 
with the surface hadn’t been meant 



128 



IF 




to be so complete. It must have 
been obvious to all concerned that a 
population of tbat size wm far too 
small to maintain a hi^y technical 
culture and equally obvious that 
only a highly technical culture could 
live under those conditions. They 
presumably meant to maintain in- 
tellectual contact with the rest of 
mankind — probably they even 
meant to maintain physical connec- 
tion, since it’s hard to believe that 
they expected to be able to manu- 
facture every piece of equipment 
they needed to keep themselves go- 
ing. 

But they didn’t maintain those con- 
tacts. They couldn’t. They might pos- 
sibly have managed, even in the face 
of the unexpected difficulty,, if what 
contact there was didn’t have to be 
siureptitious; but the two factors to- 
gether broke the link. 

The unexpected difficulty might 
have been foreseen if the station had 
been running for more than a very 
few years before the break; there 
would have been some eye-opening 
experience. As it was, the experience 
came later. 

A technical culture has to be a 
literate one, at least until some 
adequate substitute for the reference 
book can be devised. Did you ever 
consider the problem of teaching a 
phonetic language like Russian or 
English to someone who had never 
heard a spoken word and can’t pro- 
duce a sound himself? 

All right, I know it can be done 
by a highly trained specialist. What 
do you do, though, for the special- 
ists needed when no one in the en- 



tire population can speak a word 
and you want to teach the new 
^neration to read Farrington Dan- 
iels’s Mathematical Preparation for 
Physical Chemistry or some similar 
basic work? You’re not qualified 
yourself. All your neighbors are in 
the same boat. The kids themselves 
are playing around together, pre- 
sumably communicating by signs of 
some sort, but what are the chances 
of the signs they’ve invented for 
themselves being useful for explain- 
ing elementary vector analysis? Even 
elementary discipline questions are 
hard enough to get across; in this 
medium it’s impossible to adminis- 
ter a decent spanking. 

Still, you’ve got to produce a cer- 
tain number of competent engineers 
and technicians with each genera- 
tion, or the whole group is going to 
die in the darkness and chill of the 
ocean bottom. 

What you*d do I don’t know, but 
this group leaned heavily on pictures. 
I don’t know the details. There were 
differing versions in the books I 
read, and I suspect that many of 
them were guesses on the part of the 
writers. There must have been a lot 
of determination, some panic, a high 
general intelligence level and a cer- 
tain amount of plain luck involved. 
As it came out in the end, the grand- 
children of the original group had 
the use of a highly workable written 
language which must have evolved, 
just as I’d suspected when I saw it, 
from electrical and engineering dia- 
grams — the sort of things where 
the connection between symbol and 
experience could be most easily 
shown to the growing children. The 



130 



IF 




gesture language was a derivative 
of the written one, with gesture pat- 
terns standing for drawn symbols in 
much the way that our phonetic writ- 
ten languages are derivatives of the 
spoken equivalents. Think over the 
details yourself; I’m still incompetent. 

What I could see was that chil- 
dren who had never heard a spoken 
word and had grown up using a 
language which is basically pictorial, 
with a back-up code of gesture sym- 
bols, are going to have quite a time 
learning a language which is basical- 
ly oral, with a back-up code of writ- 
ten phonetic symbols. 

I don’t say it will be impossible 
for them. An intelligent and deter- 
mined person can accomplish re- 
markable things. I do say that very, 
very few of them are going to con- 
sider it worth much effort. The ma- 
jority, however intelligent, are un- 
likely to be determined. 

Of the few that will make the 
effort, none will have much confi- 
dence in their own skill, because 
they will never have had a chance to 
check it except on each other. They’ll 
be like a social club which has de- 
cided to learn Sanskrit as a project 
and has only books to learn from. 
There’ll be some uncertainty even in 
matching an engineering text with 
the machinery it’s supposed to de- 
scribe. Given the choice between us- 
ing the original maintenance manual, 
printed in chicken tracks which real- 
ly Stand for sounds they’ve never 
heard, and using the notes made for 
their convenience by the maintenance 
workers who already know the ma- 
chines — which are the kids going 
to do for homework? 



O f course, the original books are 
still available as the years go 
on. They oertainly aren’t getting 
worn out. Unfortunately, as the years 
go on the original books become 
less and less useful. They need 
modern texts, in one sense; but there 
are two strikes against the modern 
text. 

First and obviously, they can’t 
read it. Second, it’s about as directly 
useful on machines designed and 
built a century or so ago as the 
manual on a power lathe would be 
to a flint-axe maker of thirty thou- 
sand B.C. 

The machines designed and built 
so long ago have lasted well, but not 
perfectly. Routine maintenance must, 
more and more often, give way to 
major repair and even replacement; 
the original books don’t cover these 
problems even if they could be read. 
The notes of the maintenance en- 
gineers certainly don’t cover them. 

So these people need helpers from 
the surface, either engineers who can 
do the necessary work without fol- 
lowing a manual, or else harder-to- 
define experts w^ho can take modern 
books and transfer their meaning to 
the local maintenance specialists. 
Maybe school-teachers would be the 
best term. 

In other words, they need 
Joe, and Bert, and Marie, and me. 
They need practically anyone they 
can recruit from the surface. Need 
us. Marie’s hypothesis was perfectly 
right They’ve been getting people 
like us for decades past — the people 
whose writings enabled me to figure 
all this out — and their survival 
depends on keeping it up.

But that gave food for another 
thought. 

It was easy enough to helieve that 
ii certain percentage of the people 
who had come to this place, either 
accidentally or as a result of sur- 
reptitious recruiting, had been per- 
suaded to stay of their own free will. 
It was much harder to believe that 
all of them had been. What had 
happened to those who had not 
agreed? 

I could see two possibilities. One 
was the fate which Marie seemed to 
expect if she tried to leave. The other 
was the explanation Bert had offer- 
ed, that they had been allowed to re- 
turn to the surface unharmed but 
that the Board had covered up their 
stories or reports. 

But Joe was a proven and admitted 
liar. He might also be wrong. 

There were references in the books 
I had read to visitors who had ar- 
rived, but of whom nothing more 
was mentioned. Of course if they 
hadn’t stayed it was unlikely that 
anything would be — either way. I 
didn’t like to believe that violence 
had been used — I preferred to be- 
lieve that Bert was right. Still, Marie 
was far from stupid, and the morals 
of this isolated culture might well 
be those of a century or so back. In 
fact, in some ways they obviously 
were. 

I t was* enough for me that there 
was even a possibility that Marie 
might be in danger. 

For once, I was in complete agree- 
ment with Bert; she had to be per- 
suaded to leave at once. Furthermore, 
she should be guarded until she was 

132 



well away from here. Guarded by 
me. That meant two jobs, of which 
the first was likely to be the harder. 
Marie bad listened to Bert’s argu- 
ments about her leaving for several 
weeks, with no result except a com- 
plete undermining of her trust in 
Bert. How could I possibly do any 
better? 

I claim to be a reasonably good 
engineer, as I’ve said before, and I 
can run a competent investigation 
when the subject is an essentially 
technical one like tracking down 
where power is going. I’m not a 
plotter, though, in the real, old-style 
meaning of the term, and for a 
while I was completely stumped by 
this problem. I suppose what blocked 
me so long from a working idea 
was a natural reluctance to tell any- 
thing but the truth to Marie, back^ 
up by an even greater dislike of 
causing her unhappiness. 

I don’t know what finally broke 
through that block. Suddenly, though, 
it seemed as clear as Say that if 
Marie were bound and determined 
to stay as long as she believed that 
Joe might be alive down here, she 
would presumably go if she were to 
be convinced that he had died down 
here. 

I didn’t like the idea. I don’t like 
lying, especially to people who trust 
me and most especially to Marie. I 
went through the usual stage in 
childhood where lying seemed the 
easiest way out of all troubles, but 
some very good teachers and a pair 
of understanding parents, assisted by 
a close friend with a good right 
cross who outweighed me by fifteen 
pounds, had helped me outgrow it. 

IF 




In the present case, I had to tell my- 
self repeatedly that it was for Marie’s 
own safety before I could decide it 
was proper to do. 

How I convinced myself that it 
would also be worth the unhappiness 
it was certain to cause her is some- 
thing I choose not to discuss. Once I 
was convinced, the plan was so sim- 
ple that I wondered why Bert had 
never thought of it. After all, he 
seemed to lack my prejudice against 
falsehood. 

XIX 

1 suggested it to him at the first 
opportunity, and he couldn’t see 
why he hadn’t thought of it either. 
He approved strongly, and compli- 
mented me as eloquently as de- 
veloping writer’s cramp would per- 
mit. Then he set to work on ar- 
rangements. 

The plan was simple enough, Joe’s 
sub was still here, of course. We 
would simply wreck it, tell Marie we 
had found the remains, and if neces- 
sary show them to her. A little care 
would make sure that the registry 
number and enough other identifica- 
tion features remained recognizable. 
With that much agreed, we set out 
for the dock where the boat lay. 
We’d have been able to get to work 
the moment we reached it, except for 
the fact that the half-hour swim with- 
out communication had enabled each 
of us to work out all the details. 
When we resumed conversation, the 
details didn’t jibe, and it took half 
an hour or so to reconcile them. 
With that, actual work and Bert’s 
search for people to help us with 



transportation, more than six hours 
passed before we were really ready 
to move the sub outside. 

We didn’t attempt to run it out 
under its own power, though that 
would have been possible. It had 
been allowed to fill with the living- 
liquid at local pressure after Joe 
had been converted. We were able to 
work on its inner plumbing with no 
trouble. We thought of bringing it 
back to the “operating room” and 
connecting it with the transfer lock 
so that we could pump room and 
sub back down to surface pressure, 
but an easier plan had occurred to 
me. 

Like all deep-work machines, Joe’s 
vessel had very large lift and ballast 
tanks. The former still worked, not 
having leaked enough flotation liquid 
to matter, judging by the sub’s pres- 
ent buoyancy. The latter, of course, 
were now full of the liquid which 
formed our regular environment. 
They were in two major units ex- 
tending nearly the full length of the 
hull parallel to the keel, with each 
unit divided into four cells by bulk- 
heads containing valves and transfer 
pumps. 

We opened all these valves. Then 
we cracked the seals on the main- 
tenance ports without opening them 
completely, so that fluid could bleed 
between the main hull interior and 
the ballast tanks. The ballast scaven- 
ger pumps would now, given time, 
empty the hull as well as the tanks. 

Finally, we arranged for the col- 
lapse of the hull. I had taken for 
granted that we could use ordinary 
explosive squibs, forgetting how 
sound affected a person living in 



OCEAN ON TOP 



133 




liquid. The things simply weren’t to 
be had; they were never used here. 

We finally settled the problem — 
we thought — by opening all the 
interhull inspection plates and re- 
moving as many of the bolted braces 
— the ones which had to be remov- 
able for maintenance purposes — 
as possible. It seemed pretty cer- 
tain that pumping out the hull now 
could hardly help but cause it to 
collapse. 

A good deal of time was wasted 
trying to improvise something that 
would start the ballast pumps either 
by time or from outside. It finally 
occurred to someone — not me — 
that there was nothing to prevent 
us from starting them from inside 
and then leaving, shutting the lock 
after us. Pressure would not start to 
drop until the hull was sealed off 
from the ocean. 

T hat seemed to finish the job. The 
sub was already weighted in 
near-equilibrium with outside bal- 
last, so we picked it up and began 
to swim toward the nearest entrance. 
There were ten of us altogether, and 
the load wasn’t too bad. We brought 
it to a halt under the roof opening, 
pushed it up until it met the inter- 
face and left it there while we 
donned outdoor coveralls. 

I wasn’t yet accustomed to these. 
I hadn’t. yet gotten around to asking 
what the little tank on the back 
was for — my theory didn’t ac- 
count for it, as you may remember. 
There was no chance to ask now. 
Bert helped me to adjust everything 
properly, though I wasn’t sure what 
he was doing part of the time. In 



three or four minutes we were casting 
off the outside ballast, and the sub 
was entering water tor the last time. 

We left a little negative buoyancy 
on her, and some of us walked sup- 
porting the hull while the rest swam 
and pushed it. Bert and I hadn’t 
made any special plans about where 
the wreck should be staged; ob- 
viously it shouldn’t be too close to 
an entrance, or there’d be little ex- 
cuse for not having found it sooner. 
On the other hand, it wouldn’t be 
possible to carry the thing too far 
away. We gave it an hour of travel 
and then let the hulk settle to the 
bottom. 

Personally, I couldn’t have found 
my way back to the entrance we had 
used, and it would have been sheer 
luck if I ran into one. Bert and the 
others didn’t seem worried, however. 
I assumed that they either knew the 
ground or had some navigation 
scheme I hadn’t yet learned about. 
The only light came from our own 
lamps, whose radiance formed a tiny 
glowing dome in the immense black- 
ness of the Pacific. We were far out 
of sight of the tent area, as I still 
called the farm region in my own 
mind. I didn’t even know the direc- 
tion in which that lay, and knowing 
would have done no good since I 
had no compass. 

Bert gestured me toward the sub’s 
lock. I opened it and went in. In a 
way, I hated to do this, but the idea 
still seemed good. 

What I had to do inside was done 
quickly; it amounted only to closing 
two switches. I closed the locks be- 
hind me and joined the others. 

We had recharged the boat’s bat- 



134 



IF 




teries, and there was no worry about 
there being energy enough to empty 
her. I was quite proud of remember- 
ing that point — large as the tanks 
were, adding the hull volume to 
them meant a tremendous additional 
job for the pumps. However, I had 
barely reached the rest of the group 
when we were reminded of some- 
thing neither Bert nor I had thought 
of, and for which there was not the 
slightest excuse for either of us. 

Emptying the ballast tanks with 
the flotation tanks still full put posi- 
tive lift on the boat. Naturally, she 
started up. 

Fortunately the initial rise wasn’t 
too quick. I was able to catch her, 
open the lock under power — I 
couldn’t have done it manually with 
pressure difference already set up 
— and unseal and open the lift- 
jettison valves. By the time I got 
outside again the ship was a couple 
of hundred feet from the bottom. 
The swimmers were flocked around 
covering the scene with their lights: 
I looked at the top of the hull and 
saw the oily stream of lift fluid pour- 
ing out. The rate of climb was al- 
ready slowing, and in a muinte or 
two it ceased and reversed. We fol- 
lowed the ship back to a place on 
the bottom not too far from the 
one we had picked. 

And there we waited. And waited. 
And waited. 

T he helpers talked finger-language 
among themselves. Bert and I 
couldn’t talk at all, since the pad 
had been left back at the entrance 
when we had donned the coveralls. 
We each knew just about what the 



other was thinking, though, and as 
time went by and the hull just lay 
there we began to exchange inquiring 
glances. 

The pumps had had time to han- 
dle the total volume by now, cer- 
tainly. The inside of that ship should 
be practically a vacuum. 

We had paid no attention to what 
was left in her air tanks. There 
couldn’t have been enough to matter 
at this pressure. No bubbles had ap- 
peared from the ballast vents, but 
any air released by the tanks inside 
might well have gone into solution 
at this pressure before being ejected. 

The problem was not whether the 
inside pressure was zero or some 
small number of atmospheres, 
though; it was what we could pos- 
sibly do about the hull’s failure to 
collapse. The pressure would stay 
down until long after the pumps ran 
out of fuel, and even that would be 
a long time since they must now be 
running free. Considering the general 
reliability of Board equipment, it 
could be months before some tiny 
leak let the internal pressure build 
up again to the point where even 
power could open the locks. I didn’t 
know how long we could sit around 
without more oxygen-food, but it 
certainly wasn’t months. As a matter 
of fact, it was going to be fairly 
hard to explain the three days or so 
which had already passed since I 
had seen Marie. Any more would be 
much harder, but I couldn’t afford 
to see her again without a con- 
vincing story about Joe all ready. 

A . depth charge would have been 
helpful. Even a squib would prob- 
ably have been enough; the hull. 



OCEAN ON TOP 



135 




after what we had done to it, must 
be very, very close to its limit. Un- 
fortunately, there were still no ex- 
plosives available. 

All I could think of was to take 
the sub back, have Bert or me go 
into the conversion room, attach 
the sub to the lock which was sup- 
posed to connect the room with 
just such visitors, go through what- 
ever had to be done to get the man 
back to surface pressure and pump 
the room back down so he could 
get into the sub to start everything 
over. I didn’t like the idea. I was 
pretty sure Bert wouldn’t either, 
but I couldn’t find out under the 
circumstances. It wasn’t the sort of 
idea which could be transmitted 
by any gestures I knew. It was go- 
ing to take quite long enough with 
the writing pad. 

I did manage to make Bert un- 
derstand that we would have to go 
back for the pad and a conference. 
When I tried to indicate that the 
sub should be brought with us, 
though, he vetoed the suggestion 
flatly. After a minute or two I 
stopped trying to push the idea. As 
I said, I wasn’t too fond of the 
basic plan anyway. 

He made some gestures to the 
others, and all but four came with 
us; the four settled down on a level 
patch of mud twenty yards from the 
ship and started a game of some 
sort. At any other time I’d have 
been curious about the details. 

The swim back was, of course, 
much quicker than the one out — 
or rather, would have been if we 
had made it. 

I don’t know how far we got in 
136 



the eight or ten minutes we were 
swimming. I suppose a quarter of 
a mile is a reasonable guess. I’m 
not the world’s most efficient swim- 
mer, and even I wasn’t overwork- 
ing. 

The interruption, like so much 
else which had gone wrong with 
our plans, should have been fore- 
seen, but none of us had foreseen 
it. If we had, we wouldn’t have 
been waiting anywhere around the 
sub after her ballast pumps had 
started. 

It was obvious enough in nature, 
and the only reason I didn’t realize 
what had happened in the first sec- 
ond after the event was, of course, 
that I wasn’t really conscious. 

XX 

I f you submerge yourself in water 
and have a friend knock a cou- 
ple of large rocks together repeated- 
ly, starting twenty or thirty yards 
away and coming closer until you 
can’t Stand it any more, you may 
have some idea of what happened. 

I can’t describe how it felt. In 
fact, since it 'knocked me uncon- 
scious for several seconds, it isn’t 
right to say that I felt anything. 
There was sensation of a sort, 
though; perhaps if I were ^ure just 
what it feels like to be hit with a 
sledge hammer simultaneously on 
every square inch of my body I 
might use that as an illustration. 
As it is. I’ll have to let you use 
your own imagination, aided if you 
like by the experiment I suggested 
a moment ago. 

The shock affected all of us 

IF 




about equally. It was a minute, 
perhaps more, before we were 
swimming as fast as we could back 
toward the place we had left the 
others. None of us had any doubt 
about what had happened; none of 
us was really eager to go back to 
the scene. 

But we hurried. 

I had expected to find four 
bodies in the mud where our com- 
panions had been enjoying their 
game, but it wasn’t that simple. 
The wreckage of the sub was about 
where it had been, as far as I could 
tell. But the shock wave as the hull 
imploded had kicked up a cloud 
of ooze which was still settling, 
and our lights showed us very little. 
We stayed close together and swam 
through the obscurity in all direc- 
tions, searching every square foot 
of bottom not only for obvious 
fragments but for signs of objects 
buried under recently settled mud. 
That took no communication to ar- 
range. 

We found one of the men partly 
buried about fifteen feet from the 
nearest part of the wreck. He seem- 
ed intact as far as gross injuries 
were concerned, but I knew he 
couldn’t possibly be alive. The 
shock wave had knocked us out at 
several hundred yards, and the in- 
verse square law applies under 
water, too. 

We could find none of the others 
on the bottom, but as the mud 
settled another of them became 
visible about twenty feet up, rising 
very slowly. A thin trail of oily 
droplets was leaking from the base 
of his helmet. I hadn’t stopped to 



think that with the dense Uqukl 
filling them, Ihe suits must also 
have flotation material to let the 
wearers swim in water. With the 
heavier liquid leaking out, the fel- 
low’s buoyancy was going positive. 

That made it fairly obvious why 
we couldn’t find the other two. 
They had probably sprung faster 
leaks. I could imagine them some- 
where above us in the dark, bal- 
looning toward the surface with 
the last of the liquid that had made 
their strange lives possible dribbling 
back toward the sea bottom. I 
thought of looking for a rain of oily 
drops which might let us track 
them, but I had no way of com- 
municating the suggestion to the 
others, and it was pretty obvious 
that our lights were far too weak 
for such a search anyway. The rest 
of the group had the same general 
idea, evidently. With the two 
bodies in tow, we headed back 
toward the entrance. 

I wished there were enough light 
to read the facial expressions of 
our companions. I would have liked 
to be able to guess how they felt 
about the foreigners whose opera- 
tions had killed four of their 
friends. I didn’t know what reason 
Bert had given for the whole pro- 
cedure; maybe they thought it was 
an important piece of engineering 
research, or something like that. I 
hoped so. It was bad enough feel- 
ing guilty myself, without having 
the rest of the population down 
on me too. 

I also wished I knew how Bert 
felt. The victims might have been 
close friends of his, for all I knew. 



OCEAN ON TOP 



137 




1 thought I might get some idea 
when we reached the entrance, 
but I was disappointed. There was 
plenty of excitement when we came 
in, but I simply couldn’t tell what 
most of the facial expressions 
meant. 

I hadn’t realized how convention- 
al such expressions actually are; 
unless you’ve grown up in a society 
where there is a standard face mask 
for anger, and another for disgust, 
and so on, reading faces isn’t a 
very safe way to collect informa- 
tion. The people might have been 
angry, sad or disgusted; I couldn’t 
tell. There was much gesturing 
among them as the bodies were 
taken away, and a certain amount 
between some of them and Bert, 
but all I can say about their feeling 
toward us comes from the fact that 
we weren’t mobbed. I couldn’t even 
be sure that that situation would 
last; maybe no close friends or re- 
latives of the victims happened to 
be present. 

Activity around the entrance 
took half an hour or so to die down 
to normal. The bodies were finally 
gone, the men who had been with 
us had swum off about their own 
affairs and the swimmers one always 
seemed to see around any of the 
entrances were paying no more at- 
tention to us than usual. For some 
of them, that was a good deal; the 
girl who had gone down to the 
power section with us was back 
with her friends. 

Bert was finally able to use the 
writing pad again. There was a lot 
I would have said — I was still 
feeling shaken, and guilty, and a 

138 



lot of other things of which stupid 
was the kindest — but the same 
old communication trouble blocked 
me. There are some times when a 
man just can’t talk fast enough, and 
a lot of times when he can’t come 
even close to writing fast enough. 

I rather expected Bert to say 
something about what had happen- 
ed, since I was sure enough of his 
facial expressions to know that he’d 
been hit pretty hard too. But his 
writing was confined strictly to 
business. 

“That should convince Marie, if 
anything will. The best thing will 
be for you to go to her now, tell 
her Joe’s sub has been found wreck- 
ed and try to persuade her to take 
her own boat out to see it. Then 
she may be willing just to keep on 
going. If she won’t believe you and 
insists on staying put, we’ll have to 
bring the wreck in. That’ll have 
to work. I don’t know what we’ll 
do if it doesn’t.” 

“You could stop feeding her.” 

He looked at me and raised one 
eyebrow. 

“Could you?” he scrawled. I 
shrugged my shoulders, but knew 
I couldn’t. 

“Lead on,” I wrote. He led. 

T he speechless pauses while I was 
going from one place to an- 
other would have given me all sorts 
of opportunity to think, and maybe 
even to see holes in the fabric I’d 
been so busy weaving, if I were 
only another hundred per cent or 
so quicker on the uptake. As it was, 
the next twenty minutes of swim- 
ming brought me no ideas at all 



IF 




except details of what to say to 
Marie. 

None of these represented first- 
class plotting. I was still very un- 
easy as 1 swam up to her sub — 
Bert had stayed out of sight, as be- 
fore — and tapped on the hull. 
Fortunately, that attitude fitted per- 
fectly with the act I was supposed 
to play. 

Marie answered almost at once, 
and her face appeared at the con- 
ning port. It was nice to see an- 
other set of features on which the 
expression could be read, even 
though the expression wasn’t all I 
would have liked just at first. It 
softened a little when she recog- 
nized me, though. As before, I 
couldn’t be sure of her vocal in- 
tonations, but the words came 
through understandably enough. 
“Where have you been? I was be- 
ginning to think they’d disposed 
of you, too.” I answered the im- 
portant part of the remark on the 
pad. 

“Finding things out.” 

“From Bert?” 

“No. They have a library here, 
much of it handwritten stuff by 
other people who have come down 
here in the past — and much too 
much of it for Bert to have written 
himself. The writings are pretty con- 
sistent, and I think I have a fairly 
sound picture of the whole situ- 
ation.” 

“What did you learn about Joe?” 

I hesitated. I had been sure the 
question would come early, and I 
had my lie all made up, but telling 
a lie to Marie came hard. I told 
myself again that it was in a good 



cause and started to write, but she 
had already caught my hesitation, 
or maybe the expression that w^t 
with it — I’ve never claimed to be 
an actor. 

“You have heard about him, 
haven’t you?” I nodded. 

“And he’s — he’s — ” 

She fell silent, watching me 
through the armor glass. I nodded 
to that, too. It was easier than 
writing an out-and-out falsehood. 

I couldn’t see anything but her 
face, but I could imagine the 
clenched fists. In fact, I had to 
wince as what was probably one 
of them struck the inside of the 
hull and sent a painful sound wave 
pulsing out into the room. Her voice 
came again. 

“I was right. He wouldn’t sell 
out. He wouldn’t give up every- 
thing a decent person believes in, 
so they killed him.” 

“Why should they destroy him 
that way?” I countered. “It could 
have been done much more easily 
while he was inside, as he must 
have been when they were talking 
to him if you’re right. They could 
have let him suffocate or starve — 
which they haven’t done to you, 
remember — when his supplies ran 
out. They wouldn’t have wasted the 
sub that way, either.” 

“Simple. Because they wanted 
the death to occur outside, with 
him in the sub, so that when a 
search was made it would appear a 
regular accident. I’m surprised you 
didn’t think of that.” At least she 
didn’t say *"even you.” 

I’m slower-witted than Marie and 
know it perfectly well, but I had

tlK>U(g)it of that, as well as an 
answer for it. • 

“Don’t be silly. Who’d be sur- 
prised, or even suspicious, at find- 
ing nothing when they did search 
for him? The Pacific has a lot of 
square miles at its bottom, and 
even more cubic ones on the way 
down.” 

For a wonder, she had no answer 
to that, and was silent for several 
seconds. When she did speak again, 
she had dropped the subject of Joe 
for the moment and asked me to 
tell her what I had learned from 
the library. 

XXI 

I t took a long time, but I did my 
best. She read each page with 
care, sometimes nodding silently, 
sometimes asking questions after 
finishing it. I answered them all 
as my knowledge permitted. 

About half her questions had to 
do with how heavily I had depended 
on Bert for my information. It 
must have been over an hour be- 
fore I had painted about the same 
general picture for her that I had 
formed myself. 

I closed with the plea that was 
the key to the whole plan. 

“Marie, you’ve got to get back 
and report all this. Whatever Bert 
may have said about your staying, 
the Board has got to knx>w every- 
thing. Bert and I will get back on 
our own when we can, and you 
don’t have to consider Joe any 
more.” 

“Bert? Why should he want to 
go back? I know he’s staying. He 



admitted it. He’s had a taste of 
doing what he wants, without hav- 
ing to consider other people. He 
tried to talk me into doing the 
same, the dirty beast. The fact that 
he’s staying here is the only thing 
that makes me willing to listen to 
your suggestion that I go.” 

‘T don’t believe that of him,” 
I wrote. “He told me he was stay- 
ing, too, but implied that it wasn’t 
permanently. My feeling then was 
that he’d joined to find out what 
we need to know and would come 
back when and if he could, just 
as I did.” 

“I can believe it of yon.'' She fell 
silent again and thought for several 
minutes while 1 listened to my own 
heartbeat. It was the most en- 
couraging thing she’d ever said to 
me, and I felt worse than ever 
about the lie. I had to tell myself 
several times more that it wasn’t for 
her own safety. 

Her own safety wasn’t Marie’s 
concern, however. She made that 
clear enough in the next few min- 
utes. When she finally did speak 
again, it was clear that she’d been 
doing some rapid planning. 

“All right,” she said. “I’ll go, 
though I still don’t think they’ll 
let me get away. There’ll be some 
sort of accident. I’ve an idea, 
though, which just might tell which 
of us is right about this.” 

“I looked at her inquiringly, but 
didn’t bother to write anything. 

“You seem to believe that they’re 
willing for me to go back and re- 
port to the Board, and that the 
change that’s been made in you and 
Bert can be reversed so that you can

IF 




come back and breathe air again 
when you want to. Right?” I 
nodded. “All right. I don’t believe 
either of those items. To find out, 
you just swim off and tell Bert that 
m go back if he’ll come with me, 
in this sub. He can come back 
down afterward again if he likes, 
but I’ll be much more convinced 
of his yarn if I see him breathing 
air again, and I’ll feel a lot safer 
if he’s in this boat with me when I 
drive it out of here. Now tell me 
why you think that’s a silly idea 
and a waste of time and effort, and 
all that sort of nonsense.” 

I didn’t need air-normal sound 
transmission to know there was sar- 
casm in her tone; I couldn’t hear 
it, but it was certainly there. She 
didn’t trust me entirely, either. At 
least I could get some satisfaction 
out of surprising her with my 
answer. 

“It seems like a fine idea to me,” 
I wrote. “I’ll find Bert and put it 
up to him. I suppose you wouldn’t 
accept me as a substitute if he pre- 
fers to stay a while longer.” 

Her expression changed a little, 
but I wasn’t quite sure what the 
new one meant. 

“ ’Fraid not,” she said. “It would 
prove your point about the return 
possibility, but I don’t think you’d 
make as good a hostage.” That was 
some comfort, anyway. “We’ll play 
it my way, as far as it goes. Go 
find Bert and learn what he says.” 

I swam off obediently. Bert was 
waiting in the entrance chamber 
this time, apparently improving his 
knowledge of the finger language 

OCEAN ON TOP 



with the assistance of our same old 
followers, the girl and her friends 
— two of them, anyway. I couldn’t 
have told which was the missing 
one. 

I had boiled everything down to 
one sentence on the pad and show- 
ed this to him the moment I was 
close enough. 

“Marie says she’ll go if you’ll 
change back and go with her.” 

He stared at it for a full half 
minute without even moving to take 
it from my hand. Then he suddenly 
snatched it and, without clearing 
the writing, swam off down the tun- 
nel toward the sub. The rest of us 
followed. He streaked over to the 
conning port where her face was 
stm visible and held up the pad 
with my words still on it. She 
looked at it. He pointed at me and 
back at the pad and put on an ex- 
pression which anyone, regardless 
of cultural background, could have 
read. She answered aloud. 

“That’s it, Bert.” He cleared the 
page, looking at her in a puzzled 
fashion. 

“Why?” he wrote. 

“I may explain later. Will you 
come?” 

His answer startled Marie. I wasn’t 
sure what it did to me. 

“Sure. I may have to come back 
later — there’s useful work to do 
down here. But it might be best if I 
went with you now anyway. There’s 
a lot to be reported that there 
hasn’t been time for either of us to 
tell you.” I thought that was a 
pretty tactful way of passing off her 
refusal to listen to him all those 
weeks. “I could make a more 

U1 




tharougii job of it.” He paused in 
thought, even longer than it took 
Marie to read die sentences. Then he 
went on, “We’ll tow your suib to the 
operating room — it’ll he easier that 
way than for you to pilot it — and 
connect it to the lock. I’ll go in and 
get depressurized. They won’t argue 
too hard. I can come in through 
your lock then, and we can go hack 
up together.” He turned to me and 
added the word, “Okay?” 

I wasn’t sure it was okay. Without 
Bert I wouldn’t be able to do any- 
thing useful, as far as I could see. 
No doubt the girl who was still 
watching us, and her friends, might 
be willing to keep me from starving 
until I learned my way around. 
They might even guide me back to 
where I could work with Joe, if that 
was to be my main occupation; but 
I couldn’t see what use I’d be to the 
Board that way. I hope it’s been 
obvious that I never intended my 
residence to be permanent, as Joe 
apparently had. I hadn’t been lying 
to Marie about that. 

There was no use suggesting that 
I go back with the two of them. 
The sub wouldn’t take us. It was 
built for one, and crowding Bert in 
would be hard enough. 

T ien I remembered that Bert’s 
own sub should still be around 
somewhere. I gabbed the pad. 

“Why can’t we all go back? I 
wrote. “Your boat must still be 
here, too. If Marie feels so strongly 
about having you in hers, I could 
still use yours. You can still come 
down again, or both of us can, if 
the job seems to call for it.” 



It seemed like a fine idea to me, 
and even Marie appeared to approve 
of it, but Bert had a question or 
two. I had to admit he raised good 
points. 

“The operating room will handle 
only one at a time. Once I’m done, 
there’ll be communication trouble 
during your own depressurization.” 

“You could explain the whole pro- 
gram to them first. For that matter, 
I could go through it first.” 

“I’m not sure I could explain it 
too well. Remember, I’m no expert 
in this finger-wiggling.” 

“But why couldn’t I go first, with 
you directing which sub was to be 
connected, and so on, until it was 
your turn?” 

“You could, I suppose. We’d bet- 
ter check my boat, ithough. It’s been 
here a long time and been used for 
regular work here. The flotation sys- 
tem will certainly need going over. 
I’m not sure I’d like to risk it against 
pressure differential myself, but 
we’ll see. We’d better check that 
first.” 

Marie had been reading our con- 
versation and nodded approval, so 
our flock went off to look over the 
vessel. 

He was right. The flotation liquid 
was completely gone. It hadn’t been 
used even locally for months, since 
there were no facilities for making 
the hydrocarbon its buoyancy tanks 
were designed to use. The local ma- 
chines used the" same sort of low- 
density solid employed in the swim- 
ming coveralls; it would have in- 
volved major structural changes to 
put that into the submarine. No one 
had considered it worth the trouble. 



142 



IF 




“I could use one of the local 
boats,” I suggested when this became 
clear. 

“Don’t try it until you learn the 
language,” was the rejoinder. That 
seemed a little silly. A sub is a sub,* 
and you either understand them or 
you don’t. A look into one of them 
educated me, though. 

I still don’t see why their control 
panels are made that way; the laws 
of physics are the same down here 
as up above. Apparently the differ- 
ence in basic thinking which goes 
with that weird graphic language ex- 
tends into more factors than mere 
common sense would lead anyone 
to expect. 

I t began to look as though the other 
two were going back alone. Bert 
seemed quite resigned to it, and even 
1 was getting that way. When we 
went back to Marie with the word, 
though, she came up with another 
of her ideas. I’ve come to suspect 
since then that she had something 
more in her mind than just getting 
me back to the surface, just as she 
had when she insisted on Bert’s go- 
ing along, but she didn’t confide in 
me. Of course, that may have been 
because there was no way for her to 
speak to me alone. 

“There’s plenty of spare buoyancy 
in my tanks,” she pointed out sud- 
denly and firmly. “Just attach that 
wreck of Bert’s to my tow-lugs, and 
v.e can haul it along. You say the 
hull’s sound enough to hold against 
the pressure when you pump it down 
again.” 

Bert seemed startled, no doubt be- 
cause he hadn’t thought of that him- 



self. That was my suspicion, any- 
way. But he promptly agreed; and 
so it was settled. He went off to 
get help in towing the subs and to 
arrange for the operating room, and 
I took advantage of his absence to 
write a remark or two to Marie. 

“You seem to have been wrong 
about Bert. He certainly took you up 
fast enough on that test suggestion.” 

“So I noticed.” 

I waited for further comment, but 
got none. I suppose I should have 
known better than to expect any. 
When she did speak again, it was on 
a wholly different subject — I 
thought. 

“Be sure you check the bitts on 
both subs very carefully.” 

I nodded, surprised; that was too 
standard a procedure to call for 
special comment. 

“And the lines, too. You’ll use 
mine; they’re newer.” I agreed silent- 
ly, wondering and perhaps hoping a 
bit. Anything from Marie that sound- 
ed like interest in my welfare was 
enough to make me hope. I was 
still several miles behind her reason- 
ing, only partly because I hadn’t 
started out with the same set of prej- 
udices. She wanted it that way, I 
guess; she firmly changed the sub- 
ject by asking about the people who 
were floating beside me. 

“Who are your friends? Is the 
lady one of the reasons you decided 
to stop breathing air?” 

“No!” I wrote emphatically. “I 
never saw her to my knowledge be- 
fore I made the change.” I couldn’t 
understand why Marie was laughing. 
“I can’t introduce you, because I’ve 
never heard their names. With this 



OCEAN ON TOP 



143 




language, I’m not sure what a per- 
sonal name would be like. Miaybe 
they haven’t any.” 

She grinned for the first time since 
I’d seen her down here. 

“That accounts for your staying, 
then. No, don’t bother to point out 
that you didn’t know about the lan- 
guage till afterward. I know you 
didn’t. It must be a strong recom- 
mendation for the place, though, now 
that you do know about it.” 

As it happened, I hadn’t thought 
of that. She was quite right, though. 
That was one nuisance of my life 
which couldn’t possibly follow me 
down here. Marie was watching my 
expression and, I guess, reading it 
like a book. She laughed even louder 
than before. The sound wasn’t much 
like laughter under the circumstan- 
ces, but it was different enough from 
ordinary speech to catch the attention 
of my attendants. They looked from 
me to the sub and back, but could 
make nothing of it. The girl smiled 
again, though. 

Marie was right, in a way. If I did 
have to stay down here for any rea- 
son — 

I killed that thought firmly. Where 
Marie went, I was going, sooner or 
later. 

XXU 

T he party grew almost gay for a 
while as^ we waited for Bert. 
Both Marie and I tried more com- 
munication experiments with the girl 
and her friends, but only the most 
elementary signs made sense to them, 
and not always even these. We even 
tried to get the idea of a phonetic 



alphabet across, Marie providing the 
sounds and 1 the symbols. But it was 
hopeless. 

This wasn’t entirely due to their 
own background deficiencies; sounds 
were modified enough in this com- 
bination of media so that basic let- 
ters no longer abstracted the same 
parts. For example, “p” and “s” 
didn’t sound as different as they 
should, and when you put them to- 
gether in a word like “speak” the 
combination of symbols had even 
less resemblance, or I should say 
recognizable relation, to the com- 
bination of sounds. About all that 
was accomplished before Bert came 
back was to convince even Marie 
that there was a genuine, serious 
problem in communication to be 
solved. 

She wasn’t even yet, convinced 
that it was worth solving. She was 
willing now to think of these people 
as a whole separate culture rather 
than a group of criminal fugitives 
from our own, but she still thought 
of the culture rather as a dignified 
lady of mid-nineteenth century Bos- 
ton probably regarded the South Sea 
cannibals her missionary society had 
told her about. 

At least, she was polite to them. 

The politeness faded a trifle when 
Bert came back with bad news. The 
Council, it seemed, would hear noth- 
ing of letting both Bert and me go 
back to the surface at the same 
time. Either one was all right, but 
not both. 

I was dumfounded and unable to 
fit this into my picture of the situ- 
ation. Marie didn’t actually say “I 
told you so,” but the look she gave 



144 



IF 




me earned die thought completely. 
It was unfair, since she hadn’t. She 
might have guessed it for herself, 
but she hadn’t told me. 

Maybe it was that look that stif- 
fened me up again. I reminded my- 
self that the main thing was to get 
Marie back to the surface safe and 
sound. After she’d reported in, the 
Board would certainly open com- 
munication with this place, no mat- 
ter what Bert thought, and there’d 
be all sorts of other chances to get 
back myself. 

I still, you must remember, didn’t 
believe Bert’s claim that the Board 
had ignored or buried earlier reports 
of this installation. My feeling was 
based mostly on my personal prej- 
udices as a long-time Board official; 
I just couldn’t imagine the organi- 
zation’s doing such a thing. 

So it still seemed sensible for me 
to let the other two go back to- 
gether while I stayed on temporarily. 
I said so, without all the background 
thoughts, on the pad. Bert agreed at 
once. 

M arie seemed a little less enthusi- 
astic now, but finally decided 
that this was acceptable. Bert sug- 
gested that he go off once more to 
report the new situation to the Coun- 
cil and find help for towing the sub, 
but she countered with the idea that 
she drive it herself with one of the 
natives swimming ahead as a guide. 
Bert could tell the guide where she 
was supposed to go. 

I was a little surprised that she was 
willing to take the boat anywhere 
without Bert along, in view of her 
stated plan, but I realized that she 



might have thought of several new 
aspects of the matter since then. 1 
hoped she might want me to go with 
her to the conversion lock instead, 
but she made no mention of such 
a thought. Once again 1 felt ’way 
outside as far as her plans and ideas 
were concerned. We waited until 
Bert had finished waving at one of 
the men, which took quite a while. 
Then the fellow set t)ff along the 
main corridor ouit^de the room, and 
Marie lifted her boat from the floor 
and followed in his wake — that’s 
not a very good word, since he 
couldn’t leave a visible wake under 
the circumstances, but you know 
what I mean. 

Then Bert started off to make his 
arrangements with the Council. 

He had almost disappeared when 
I thought of something and had to 
hiury after him. Fortunately he 
wasn’t being very hasty himself or 
I’d never have caught him; it was a 
major nuisance, having no way to 
call out to get someone’s attention. 
It occurred to me that there ought 
to be clickers or tappers or some- 
thing of that sort for the purpose. 
It then occurred to me that maybe 
there were, and I simply hadn’t 
learned about them yet. Anyway, I 
did catch Bert and quickly wrote a 
question. 

“Shouldn’t someone let Joe know 
where you’re going? He’s going to 
be in almost as bad a mess as I am 
without you.” 

Bert thought for a moment, and 
nodded. 

“Probably best, yes. You’d better 
do it while I see the Council. Only 
for Pete’s sake don’t let it slip that

Marie is (here.” I looked properly 
indignant. ‘TU have one of these 
folks show you the way. He ought 
to be off shift right now, though 
he often stays longer than anyone 
expects. Anyway, you can try his 
quarters, and then the farms, before 
going back down to Power Control.” 
He turned to the others and began 
gesturing again. He finally man- 
aged to get his wishes across, though 
it was still evident that he had 
spoken the truth about knowing only 
a little of the gesture-speech. 

I wasn’t disappointed to have the 
girl touch me on the arm and 
beckon me to follow. We still had 
company, but things could have been 
worse. 

B ert must have gotten across with 
his gestures just about what he’d 
written. We went first to what was 
obviously a private residence — at 
least, it was obvious after we were 
inside. Its door was just another of 
many along one of the tunnels. The 
girl used the first audible signal I’d 
heard since arriving — a very ordi- 
nary, though very gentle, knock on a 
round panel beside the door. 

When this went unanswered for 
half a minute or so she opened the 
door and swam in. Evidently stan- 
dards of privacy were different here. 
The apartment was divided into 
three main rooms, seemingly on a 
basis of use; one seemed to be for 
sleeping, one for reading and simi- 
lar solo activities and the largest for 
more public gatherings. Joe wasn’t 
in any of them, and the girl led us 
out again and off in a new direction. 
A short swim took us to another of 



the upward-slanting tunnels leading 
to the farm area. I was more alert 
this time and caught the change in 
slope. 

Out in the open, she stopped and 
looked around to see whether Joe 
was in sight. I spent some of the 
time she was looking in trying to 
calculate the size of the farm area 
from what I knew of the population 
size and the number visible eating 
at one time. I decided I’d need a bet- 
ter estimate on how long the average 
citizen spent both at meals and be- 
tween them before my results could 
mean much. 

It took about five minutes of 
looking and questioning others for 
the girl to find Joe. I spent some of 
that interval writing my message to 
him, so that when we did catch up 
with him I was able to give it to him 
without delay. It merely said that 
Bert was taking a trip to the surface, 
and that I understood I was to start 
working with Joe as soon as he could 
use me. 

Elfven nodded his head, took the 
pad, wrote, “All right. I’ll be going 
back to work in a few hours. I have 
to sleep after I finish eating. Can 
you find your way to the control 
room yet?” 

“I’m not sure, but I seem to have 
a good guide,” I replied. He glanced 
at the girl and nodded again. 

“I wish I could make something 
out of one or the other of these 
communication methods,” he wrote. 
“We’re going to have an awful time 
without Bert. Why is he going him- 
self, instead of sending you?” 

“He seems to feel that he can 
make a more complete report than 




I cam,” I answered. “I suppose he’s 
ri^t. As long as we’re working 
mostly with each other we won’t miss 
die language too much.” 

J oe shrugged, suggesting that he 
wasn’t entirely in agreement but 
didn’t feel strongly enough about 
the matter to write an largument. He 
resumed his eating. 

I took a few mouthfuls myself, 
but was more concerned with getting 
back to Marie; so I touched the girl’s 
shoulder — she was eating, too — 
and pointed toward the tunnel mouth 
from which we bad come. I had 
managed to keep track of its direc- 
tion. She nodded and led the way. 
At least some signs were understand- 
able to both of us, I guessed. 

It took us ten or fifteen minutes 
to get back to where we had left 
Marie. She wasn’t there, of course; 
I got the impression that my guide 
had forgotten that the sub had left 
ahead of us, though I may be doing 
her an injustice. At any rate, she 
promptly set off in the direction the 
boat had gone, and in another quar- 
ter of an hour we had reached a 
place I could remember — the cor- 
ridor with the big valve which had 
admitted my tank when I had taken 
the pressure treatment. 

Knowing more of the general situ- 
ation now, I paid more attention to 
the smaller loQk. A close look show- 
ed that it had a heavily armored ex- 
tensible collar, now retracted, which 
could ibe mated easily to the en- 
trance hatch of any ordinary work 
sub. 

I was a little surprised that Marie’s 
boat wasn’t already there. I think the 



girl was, too. At least, she looked 
around as tfaou^ didn’t quite 
know what to do or where to go 
next, and then looked at me as 
thou^ expecting some further re- 
quest. 

All I could do was nod; I was 
quite sure that this was the right 
place. It occurred to me that tun- 
nel size might have forced the others 
to take a longer route than swim- 
mers would need, or even to go out- 
side, but I could think of no way 
to make this suggestion to my com- 
panions. For that matter, I could 
imagine no reason why they shouldn’t 
think of it for themselves; they cer- 
tainly knew this place better than I. 

It was Bert who showed up first, 
accompanied by a man of middle 
age and alert appearance. He didn’t 
exactly introduce the fellow to me, 
but used the writing pad to tell me 
tiiat he was the doctor who would 
manage the heart-lung equipment 
and make sure that cavities such as 
sinuses and middle ears were taken 
care of during the pressure change. 

They had been with us ten min- 
utes or so when the sub appeared 
Irom the direction of the ocean en- 
trance. At almost the same moment 
another swimmer joined us from the 
opposite direction. I took a casual 
glance at him, supposing he must be 
another of the technicians who would 
be needed for the job; then my eyes 
closed as I tried to dear my retinas 
of what I hoped was a false image. 

When I opened them again, 
though, it was still Joey Elfven. I 
had to admit that the stage manager, 
whoever he was, had done a good 
job. 



J48 



IF 




XXIII 

I also had to admit that we should 
have foreseen it. Joey should never 
have been told of the departure 
plans until Marie and Bert were 
safely away. 

Nothing was more likely than that 
he would think of some final ques- 
tions he wanted to ask Bert, and 
he would certainly know where to 
meet him. Evidently Bert was no 
better a schemer than I was, but that 
was very little comfort at the mo- 
ment. 

Marie saw him before either Bert 
or I could think of anything to do; 
the sub suddenly left its swimming 
guide behind. Seconds later its water 
jets sent us spinning as it came to a 
halt in front of our group. Yes, 
Marie had seen Joe. Her politeness 
with the savages had evaporated. 

I had been hearing my own heart- 
beat and those of people near me 
for some time now, but I hadn’t 
realized until this moment how loud 
that beat could be. 

Marie’s voice, though, turned out 
to be louder. Her first words weren’t 
just the ones I would have expected, 
but I’ve already admitted that she 
thinks a good deal faster than I do. 
Not always in the same direction, 
or even in the right one, but faster. 

“Joe!” It ought to have been a 
howl of surprised welcome, but even 
the peculiar acoustical situation left 
me pretty sure it wasn’t. It’s hard to 
believe that a girl known to have 
gone so completely overboard for 
someone could address him in the 
tone of a stern aunt, but the resem- 
blance was there. “Joe, how long 



have you known that I was here?” 

Joe looked around for the writing 
pad; I was delighted to hand it to 
him and in no hurry to get it 
back. 

“I didn’t know until this moment,” 
he wrote. 

“How long have you known that 
Bert was here?” 

“A few weeks. I don^t remember 
exactly. Within a day or two of the 
time I got here myself.” 

I could guess what was coming 
next, but fortunately for me I was 
wrong. 

Marie was not a technician. She 
can run a sub in the ordinary course 
of duty, naturally, but she is not real- 
ly familiar with all the handling and 
operating gear carried by a work 
sub. For that reason. I’m still com- 
pletely mystified how she managed 
to coordinate her next move so per- 
fectly. One of the smaller handling 
tongs popped out of its recess and 
caught Bert neatly around the neck, 
and only when he was firmly gripped 
did she follow the action with words. 

“You dirty liar! You slimy piece 
of trepang! I ought to twist the 
head off your crooked neck! If it 
were possible I’d throttle you here 
and now! You knew why I came and 
who I was looking for. You knew 
he was here. You didn’t tell him I’d 
come, and you lied to me about 
having seen him. You twisted poor 
Tummy so that he followed your 
own crooked line!” 

I somewhat resented the implica- 
tion that I hadn’t brains or initi- 
ative enough to be held responsible 
for my own actions, but I was able to

149 




resist the temptation to break in 
and insist thait part of the plan wias 
mine. 1 didn’t even object to her 
use of one of my more odious nick- 
names. I just let her words run on. 

I won’t quote any more of them; 
as I’ve said 'already, I promised her 
not to. I was a little sorry for Bert, 
since the grip on his neck must be 
hurting, but as Marie herself had 
said she couldn’t very well strangle 
him under the circumstances. I was 
sure she wouldn’t if she could have. 
Not Marie. 

The others seemed rather concern- 
ed, though. The girl and her regular 
companion flung themselves at the 
extension arm and wrenched at it 
usdcssly. The doctor tried with 
equal lack of success to pry the 
tongs from around Bert’s neck. Joe 
knew better than to do either, but 
he was clearly bothered; he waved 
and shook his head at Marie in an 
effort to convince her that she should 
stop. It was the sort of scene which 
shc^d have been accompanied by 
lively music, screams, the thump of 
fists and the crash of broken glass; 
but it all went on in ghostly silence. 

No screams, which were impossi- 
ble; no fists, which couldn’t move 
fast enough in this medium to make 
much of a thump anyway; no ap- 
paratus within reach which was 
fragile enough to be damaged by 
the gracefully thrashing bodies. 

It was Joe who managed to bring 
it to an end. He was still holding 
the writing pad, and he hastily print- 
ed on it in the largest letters that 
would fit, “YOU’RE KILLING 
HIM!” 

He held this against the coming 



port so Marie could see practically 
nothing else. 

It took a few more seconds, but 
she suddenly got her senses back 
and released the tongs. Bert’s face 
was purplish, and he had lost con- 
sciousness; the doctor grabbed his 
wrist, I thought to check pulse, but 
in fact simply for a tow bar. The 
two of them disappeared into the 
operating room. 

I hesitated for a few seconds, un- 
sure what was most important, and 
then went after them. The girl and 
her friend followed me; Marie’s guide 
stayed outside with the sub. Joe, 
after looking as though he would 
come along, changed his mind. 

In the operating room Bert was 
quickly fastened to the table, and 
the doctor got to work. 

Strictly speaking he wasn’t a doc- 
tor, as even I realized; there can be 
no doctors in a population of a few 
thousand people which has been 
separated from the mainstream of 
human knowledge for three or four 
generation. He was a darned good 
technician, though, and fortunately 
was working right in his own field. 
He did 'know that heart-lung ma- 
chine cold, and he knew the general 
run of troubles involving the human 
breathing and circulatory systems. 
Interfering with the cougWng reflex, 
as these people had had to do for 
their pressure-survival system, had 
produced some fallout along those 
lines. There were controls for the 
machine and its auxiliary gear inside 
the room, presumably in parallel 
with the remote ones. Quite evident- 
ly depressurization wasn’t the only 
purpose of the apparatus. 



150 



IF 




I n something under sixty seconds 
the tech had Bert plugg^ into the 
gadget, and -his color was coming 
back to normal. Then, in more 
leisurely fashion, other instruments 
began looking and prying down his 
throat. 

Apparently very little real damage 
had been done there, though the 
outside of his neck was starting to 
discolor into one huge bruise. In 
less than five minutes the doc — 
I’m going to call him one, under the 
circumstances — withdrew his equip- 
ment and used a hypodermic on his 
patient’s upper arm. The needle 
must have contained a stimulant, for 
Bert opened his eyes almost at once. 

It took him only a few seconds 
to get oriented. Then he fixed his 
eyes on me and actually blushed. 
He was still a little confused, be- 
cause he started to speak. The pain 
in his chest as he put pressure on 
his liquid-filled lungs brought him 
back to reality. He looked around 
and made writing motions. The doc- 
tor didn’t seem to mind, so I went 
back for the writing pad, which Joe 
still had. 

I didn’t have to interrupt a con- 
versation to take it. Joey wasn’t 
writing, and Marie wasn’t taJking. 

Apparently nothing at all had been 
said during the crisis in the operating 
room — we’d have heard Marie’s 
voice even there, and Joe’s three 
words of a few minutes before were 
still on the pad. Marie was looking 
at him through the port, and he was 
looking everywhere but at her. I 
didn’t pause to do any analysis. I just 
took the pad from Joe and swam 
back to the table. 



The doctor called Bert’s attention 
to the blood connections between 
him and the machine, but made no 
real effort to stop him from writing. 
Bert nodded an acknowledgment of 
the warning and went ahead with 
the stylus. He wrote briefly, and 
handed the pad to me. 

“I’m sorry, but I can see when 
I’m checkmated. I hope your luck is 
better, though now that she knows 
Joe is alive I wouldn’t bet on it. Tell 
her she didn’t kill me, if you think 
the possibility is bothering her. I’d 
better not see her again myself.” 

That was an eye-opening para- 
graph. Suddenly I saw just why Bert 
had been trifling with the truth, why 
he had concealed Joe’s presence 
from Marie, why he had decided to 
go back to the surface on such short 
notice, why he had ibeen so far from 
completely frank with me — and 
even why the local Council had been 
so reluctant to let us both leave. 

I also saw that I was in no posi- 
tion to criticize him for any of it. 
There was not a word to be said 
against 'him which didn’t apply with 
equal force to me. The only reason 
I hadn’t done as much, under ex- 
actly the same motivation, was that 
I’d been in no position to. 

I couldn’t blame him, or even 
criticize him. I have failings, but 
I’m not that much of a hypocrite. 
I could be sorry for him; as he’d said, 
his chances were gone. 

Marie might conceivably come to 
realize that Joe was a hopeless case 
as far as she was concerned, even 
after this discovery that he was alive 
after all. She miglht possibly settle 
for me if that happened. But after 



OCEAN ON TOP 



151 




the last few weeks and the discover- 
ies of the last few minutes she’d 
never, never have any use for Bert. 

I gave him as sympathetic a look 
as I could as all this dawned on 
me, but I could think of nothing 
to write. He answered with a bitter 
grin and waved me toward the door. 
I went. The others, except the doc- 
tor, followed me. 

XXIV 

1 wasn’t through learning for the 
day, though. As I went through 
the huge valve and became visible 
from the tunnel outside, Marie’s 
voice met me. It had sharp edges, 
but otherwise it resembled a heavy 
club. 

“Just where did you come up with 
the idea that these people weren’t 
getting oxygen through their lungs? 
If I killed Bert Fm not too sorry, 
but it’s your fault.” 

Even I had had time to see that 
this question would be coming, but 
I’d had no chance to work out a 
very good answer. While the doctor 
had been working on Bert I’d been 
doing the same with my memory. 
It was evident enough that my 
theory of oxygen-food was out the 
window, but I still wasn’t able to 
find a better. 

All I could do was repeat the 
theory and niy reasons for it. I also 
assured Marie that she hadn’t actual- 
ly killed Bert. Somehow my reason- 
ing didn’t look as air-tight written 
out as it had felt when I was think- 
ing it through in the first place — 
quite aside from the fact that it was 
now; obviously wrong. In spite of 

152 



this, Marie seemed to calm down 
as I wrote page after page, let her 
read each, and cleared it and went 
on to the next. The forced pauses 
may have helped. 

“I admit you convinced me be- 
fore,” she said when I was done, 
“and I don’t see what the hole is 
myself. Joe, in the time you’ve been 
here have you found out enough to 
let you tell us what’s wrong with 
this notion?” 

“I think so,” he wrote. He paused, 
and positioned himself outside the 
port so that Marie could read as he 
wrote. I swam to a spot a little fur- 
ther above and behind him, so I 
could do the same. 

“Your big mistake was natural. 
You were quite right in observing 
that we aren’t breathing, as far as 
chest motions go. But in spite of that 
we are getting our oxygen from this 
liquid. It’s wonderful stuff. You 
might regard its molecular structure 
as vaguely comparable to hemoglobin 
in that it binds oxygen molecules 
loosely to its surface. I don’t know 
just how many, but the number is 
large. It doesn’t have the porphyrin 
groups of hemoglobin; they went to 
great lengths to make it transparent 
to visible light. I couldn’t draw you 
its structural formula from memory. 
But I’ve seen it. It’s, perfectly un- 
derstandable. 

“Now, think a minute. Liquid 
oxygen has a molecular concentra- 
tion about four thousand times that 
of the gas we normally breathe. The 
reason we have to breathe is that 
diffusion, at sea-level concentrations, 
won’t get enough oxygen through 
your windpipe to keep an animal as 



IP 




large as a ihuman being going. You 
can’t live in liquid oxygen, of course, 
because of temperature problems. 
However, in this liquid the concen- 
tration of almost-free oxygen is far, 
far higher than in the atmosphere 
— a long way short of what it is in 
LOX, but very high. That was an- 
other problem; while they were at it, 
they made the kernel of this mol- 
ecule with a structure which would 
break down endothermically at tem- 
peratures above a few hundred de- 
grees. A fire will tend to damp itself 
out, therefore. But that’s a side issue, 
as far as breathing is concerned. 

C4TT7hen molecules of the stuff 
▼ Vgive up their oxygen in your 
your lungs, nearby molecules pass 
on more O 2 to the ones which have 
lost it; others replenish those, and 
so on. It’s a bucket-brigade situation, 
but it’s described by just the same 
equations that you’d use for a dif- 
fusion problem. The rate of oxygen 
transport depends on the concentra- 
tion difference between the inside of 
your lungs and outside, and on the 
area of the barrier through which 
the diffusion is taking place — in 
this case, the smallest cross-section 
area of your windpipe. In this case, 
the oxygen concentration around us 
is enough to keep us going by diffu- 
sion down our windpipes. I’m not 
sure about carbon-dioxide elimina- 
tion, but I believe your theory is 
more nearly right there; it’s taken 
care of by binding into insoluble car- 
bonates in the intestines and gotten 
rid of as solid waste. As I say, that 
seems a little funny to me, and I 
may have misunderstood what I read 

OCEAN ON TOP 



about it. I’m going to dig into the 
matter more when I have time. I’m 
no physiologist, but it’s fascinating 
reading, especially the history of its 
development.” 

“But why such a fancy arrange- 
ment? A less efficient oxygen carrier 
would still work as long as you 
pumped fresh supplies' into your 
lungs! That’s why we breathe, any- 
way!” Marie couldn’t have been 
thinking at the top of her form just 
then; even I could see the answer. 
I took the pad from Joe — in fact, 
he held it out to me, with a sus- 
picion of a grin on his face — and 
started my own exposition. 

“Pumping a liquid even denser 
than water through your windpipe 
would call for tremendous effort 
and probably dangerously high lung 
pressures. I tried it just after I made 
the change, and I know it hurts. I 
wouldn’t be surprised if you could 
rupture lung tissues that way. It’s 
a logical chain: fill body cavities with 
liquid so that outside pressure can 
be matched without serious volume 
change; then you can’t pump the 
liquid with your normal breathing 
equipment; so you have to give it a 
high enough free-oxygen concentra- 
tion to diffuse an adequate supply 
down your throat. Simple once you 
see it. What’s the primary source of 
oxygen, though, Joe?” 

“Just what you’d expect. Photosyn- 
thesis. That’s where most of the 
power produced here goes. About 
three quarters of the oxygen comes 
from gene-tailored algae living at the 
interface between the ocean and the 
breathing liquid. The rest comes 
from the farm plants. Loss to the 

153 




ocean is low l>ecause of the favor- 
able partition ratio.” 

I took the pad again. 

“Well, at least I was right in 
guessing why laughing is dangerous, 
and why they do away with the 
coughing reflex; either action could 
rupture your lungs.” 

“Of course,” agreed Joe. “I don’t 
claim to know the whole story yet 
— even Bert, who’s been here much 
longer, probably doesn’t. Remember, 
all we could learn about it was what 
we read, and that was only what 
happened to be lying around written 
in languages we knew. We weren’t 
told any of it by these people. Not 
only is it impossible to talk to them 
on such a level; I’m pretty sure most 
of them don’t know it either. How 
many people at the surface, out of 
any 'given fifteen thousand, would 
be doctors or physiologists or even 
engineers?” 

“Hiat’s why they need us so bad- 
ly,” I interjected. “Bert must have 
told you about that.” 

“Who’d believe Bert?” snapped 
Marie — we’d been holding all our 
writings so she could read them, of 
course, even when they weren’t 
specifically meant for her. Joe took 
over the pad. 

C^'^^ou’d better. Whatever he said 
I about these people being 
ready to do almost anything to keep 
technically skilled visitors down here 
is probably true. From what I’ve been 
able to make out in the last few 
weeks, unless some very extensive 
work is done on this installation 
quite soon, there’ll be twelve or fif- 
teen thousand people migrating back 



to the surface and asking for their 
power ration in the next couple of 
decades.” 

“How could they have the gall to 
do that?” Marie asked in scorn. 
“They’ve been down here all their 
lives, squandering power that should 
have gone into the world network 
and shared with the rest of us. 
They’re just like those old French 
aristocrats with their ‘Let ’em eat 
cake’ attitude — except the aristo- 
crats would have been too proud to 
come 'begging the Jacquerie for 
crusts if their own wealth vanished.” 

“That was my first reaction, too,” 
Joe wrote imperturbably. “I got my- 
self pressured for the same reason 
Bert and you — ” he nodded to 
me “ — did; I planned to investigate 
as completely as possible and send 
up a report that would have the 
Board down here civilizing this place 
in a month. By the time I had 
enough data for a meaningful report, 
though, I realized it would be use- 
less. The Board wouldn’t do any- 
thing about it.” 

“That’s what Bert claimed,” I put 
in. “He said that such reports had 
been sent back before, decades ago, 
and that nothing had come of them.” 
Joe reclaimed the pad. 

“I never ran into any accounts 
of that sort. Bert and I wouldn’t have 
looked for just the same material, 
though, an)rway. My point is that the 
Board can’t do anything about it.” 

“Why not? Look at all the energy 
going to waste down here!” inter- 
jected Marie. 

“Think again, girl. It’s not going 
to waste, any more than the power 
used by natural plants on the sur- 



154 



IP 




face for photosynthesis is going to 
waste — far less, in fact. It’s true 
that you can divide the power out- 
put of this installation by the local 
population figure and come up with 
a figure many times the normal per 
capita energy ration; but by far the 
greater part of that power goes into 
the lights. If you cut any significant 
percentage of the lights, you drop 
the photosynthesis rate to a level 
where there won’t be enough oxygen 
for the present population. If you 
cut the population by much, even 
the shaky maintenance that the out- 
fit has now will degenrate, and, as I 
said, the place will have to shut 
down. 

“You may criticize the decision the 
ancestors of these people made three 
or four generations ago. I agreed it 
was highly immoral by our standards. 
However, the current population is 
simply stuck with the consequences, 
and at least they’re not drawing from 
the planetary power net. They’re on 
their own, except intellectually. It 
seems quite in line with duty, to me, 
to stay here and help them. You’ll 
have to make your own choice.” 

Marie was silent for half a min- 
ute or so, wrapped in thought. When 
she spoke again, it seemed to be a 
change of subject. 

“Why did Bert lie to me? None of 
what you’ve been pointing out — 
which I can see makes sense — 
seems to call for it.” 

Joe shrugged. 

“I have no idea. Remember, he 
didn’t tell me you were here, much 
less anything else connected with 
you. I don’t know what he had on 
his mind.” 



J oe’s eyes and Marie’s both swivel- 
ed toward me. After looking at 
my face for three or four seconds, 
the girl said, “All right, you know. 
Out with it.” 

I reached for the pad which Joe 
was holding out to me, and made it 
fairly brief. 

“He lied to you for the same rea- 
son I did. He didn’t care what you 
reported to the Board, but he didn’t 
want you ever to learn that Joe was 
alive. He wanted to get you back 
to the surface believing that Joe was 
just a memory and go back with 
you. I’d have done the same.” 

Joe took the pad after Marie 
had read it, cleared off the message 
and wcoie, “Thanks, Pal,” holding 
it so that I could see it but not Marie. 
Then he cleared it again immediate- 
ly. If Marie noticed this, she made 
no comment. She may not have no- 
ticed, for my words had obviously 
jolted her. 

“I see,” she said after at least two 
minutes of silence. “That puts a dif- 
ferent light on the whole thing. He’s 
less obvious than some people, I 
must admit.” She paused for a few 
more seconds. Then, “Joe, I admit 
it’s your own private business; but 
are you willing to tell me exactly 
and truthfully why you decided to 
stay down here?” 

A negative shake of the head was 
the answer. 

“Or how long you plan to stay?” 
Another negative. 

“Or even whether you still regard 
yourself as a Board official?” 

Still refusal. I was pretty sure that 
Joe didn’t really care whether Marie 
knew the answers to those questions. 



OCEAN ON TOP 



155 




especially the first one; but, especial- 
ly with the first one, he didn’t want 
to tell her himself. He was coming 
as close as his personality would let 
him to telling her to get out of his 
hair. Marie, as I have already said 
many times, is sharper than I am, in 
spite of one blind spot. 

She looked at him speculatively 
after his third headshake, for several 
seconds. Then she suddenly turned 
to me. 

“Are you staying?” 

Naturally, I didn’t know. All I 
could do was throw the question back 
at her; she might be rougher on me 
than Joe had been on her, but I was 
ready for it — I hoped. 

“Are you?” I wrote. 

A shock wave, not quite painful, 
hit all of us; I don’t know whether 
she hit something with her fist or 
stamped her foot. 

“Will you make your own mind 
up, just this once?” she snapped. 

That was unjust, of course. I’m 
perfectly able to make decisions, 
and Marie knows it. She’s even ad- 
mitted it. I just don’t like to make 
them when there’s a shortage of rele- 
vant information. She knew perfectly 
well what information I wanted, and 
why, too — she’d just been trying to 
get the same sort out of Joe for the 
same reason. 

I made an honest effort to decide 
without reference to Marie, but I 
couldn’t do it. 

XXV 

O n the surface there is sunlight 
and sound. I hadn’t really ap- 
preciated either until recently. Sun- 



light on trees and lakes, blue sky, 
red and orange sunsets. Girls’ voices 
and falling raindrops and laughter 
and puns. 

Down here is the beating of hearts, 
humming machinery, tapping and 
thudding of random activity, but 
otherwise silence — no music, no 
voices, not even a tongue click or 
snapping fingers. 

On the surface there is restraint. 
Every action is conditioned by the 
underlying awareness that it may in- 
volve a waste of energy which means 
life. If someone accidentally shorts 
a power cell or lets a fire start he 
feels as guilty as the Victorian-age 
girl who misbehaved with her boy 
friend. The fact that your wife is 
dying in a hospital five miles away 
is a borderline excuse for using a 
power vehicle. An air or space flight 
is considered only in direct connec- 
tion with power acquisition or re- 
search projects. 

Down here, while there is actually 
only a slightly larger supply of ener- 
gy per person, the difference in at- 
titude is all the world. No one is 
either worried or offended that his 
neighbor has used more than his fair 
share of energy. I had winced time 
after time there in the library as a 
reader had swum off leaving his 
carrel light or reading projector go- 
ing, with no one else even noticing 
the lapse. 

And why couldn’t there be music 
here? I hadn’t heard any, and sing- 
ing was obviqusly impossible. But 
stringed instruments should work. 
They might have to be modified in 
design, but they should work. Elec- 
trical ones would certainly be possi- 



156 



IF 




ble. If there weren’t any, I could 
design them. 

Even if there were no girls’ voices, 
there were still girls. There was a 
good-looking one only a few feet 
away, watching us as though she had 
some idea of what was going on. 

But it was so different. Even with 
energy restraint gone as far as my 
neighbors were concerned, would I 
feel comfortable after a lifetime un- 
der its rules? Would the thought of 
the black, crushing ocean between 
me and all I had grown up with 
loom too large? Or if I didn’t stay, 
would the thought of what I might 
have accomplished down here come 
too often between me and normal 
living? 

I couldn’t decide. Even if I tried 
to cut out all personal factors — 
not just those connected with Marie, 
but all which by any stretch could 
be called selfish — I still couldn’t. 

There was my regular work with 
the Board. It was useful, even im- 
portant, and I liked it. I could do 
useful work down here, though, and 
would almost certainly like it. Re- 
ward, to be selfish again, meant lit- 
tie in either place. Wealth as such 
has been meaningless since power 
rationing started, and down here I 
had seen no signs of plutocracy. 
Though admittedly I might have 
missed them; I know so little about 
the place. 

Of course, I could learn more. 
Neither decision was irrevocable. 
The only thing that couldn’t be 
changed back had already been 
done; my coughing reflex was gone, 
and I’d have to be careful in eat- 



ing for the rest of my life no 
matter where I lived. 

Maybe I could stay now, see more 
of what life here was like and go 
back up later on. After all, there was 
no reason why the two places 
couldn’t stay in communication. I 
looked up and was about to write 
an answer for Marie when my 
thoughts started working again. 

Would there be communication? 
Joe had pointed out excellent reasons 
why the Board would not want 
knowledge of this place to spread, 
though he hadn’t stated them just 
that way. 

Here was a place where power 
rationing, however real it might be 
mathematically, simply wasn’t a con- 
scious factor in life. Tbe population, 
as Marie had said, was like a group 
of French aristocrats in a world of 
Jacquerie. Ordinary morals up above 
called for a rigid attitude toward 
energy use which these people didn’t 
have and probably couldn’t under- 
stand. 

If too many people from the sur- 
face visited here and the word about 
its way of life spread at all general- 
ly, there would be trouble. Even if 
the spreading word remained accur- 
ate, which was most unlikely, a lot 
of the outer world’s people would 
either want to migrate down here or 
build more volcanic-power installa- 
tions so that everyone could have 
more. The old “why can’t I have as 
much as he does” feeling would have 
people screaming for the modern 
equivalent of the philosopher’s stone, 
to take an illustration from the days 
when wealth was metal instead of

The average citizen >vould be able 
to see why the Board shouldn’t do 
just that — build more power sta- 
tions to take advantage of the in- 
exhaustible heat inside the earth. I 
hate to sound cynical, but I know 
that’s one thing the Board would 
never do. They won’t do anything 
to make power rationing unneces- 
sary. 

C ynicism aside, they’re perfectly 
right. The decision decades ago 
that hydrogen fusion was man’s only 
real hope was almost certainly a 
sound one. We know that solving 
that problem isn’t just a matter of 
engineering details, as was originally 
thought. Too many of the factors 
involved are inherently unstable un- 
less held in by, at least, the mass of 
a small star. It’s only a matter of 
faith that we’ll solve it at all. And 
if we’re to do so, it will take every 
effort — the best that man can 
offer. 

And the effort will stop if any- 
thing happens to postpone power 
starvation. Mankind as a whole did 
practically nothing but waste his re- 
sources until that menace stared him 
literally in the face. If plentiful vol- 
canic power suddenly eased the 
threat, the pressure would be off. 
Quite aside from the obvious col- 
lapse of morals which would follow, 
the fusion work would come to a 
halt. It might go on in name, but 
the work would stop. Men are too 
casual; the best of power-plant opera- 
tors start, leaving office lights on 
when they go out, just because it w 
a power plant and there’s so much 
on harid. 



And considering what the Board 
sometimes has to do about that very 
attitude, I shouldn’t count on being 
allowed to go back up if I stayed 
here now, or come back down if I 
went up now. It would be safer to 
regard my present decision, which- 
ever it might be, as irrevocable. 

And that realization, political 
philosophy and morals aside, didn’t 
make the decision any "easier to 
make. 

Was there any chance that the 
Board would insist on this place’s 
joining civilization and tying into the 
power net? 

None. The very process of con- 
necting would be almost impractical. 
Considering the trickle which could 
be spared above the photosynthesis 
drain even if the local population 
adopted the surface-rationing level, 
decades would pass before the energy 
investment of making the connection 
could possibly be paid off. It might 
never be. 

All of which meant that the trans- 
ponders I had gone to so much trou- 
ble to plant represented wasted ef- 
fort. 

So — should I stay here or not? 
Did I want to live here, or in the 
sunlight? I still didn’t know. 

T he temptation was to let it all 
depend on Marie’s decision, but 
Marie wasn’t publishing her decision. 

Bert was out of the running — 
as far as Marie was concerned he 
had never been in it, apparently. 
You’d think she’d realize by now 
that Joe was a hopeless case as far 
as she was concerned. Why wouldn’t 
she give me at least a hint?

She did. She got tired of waiting 
for me to come up with the answer 
I couldn’t make and started talking 
again. For a moment her first words 
sounded like a change of subject. 

“What do you suppose Bert will 
do now? Stay here, or go back?” she 
asked. 

I was glad enough to leave un- 
answerable questions for the mo- 
ment. 

“He stayed here for a year before 
all this happened,” I pointed out. “I 
can’t see that the last few minutes 
can have given him any burning 
urge to change his mind. I should 
think he’d have less reason than 
ever to go back now.” I raised my 
eyebrows in query to Joe at the same 
time. He read the note, shrugged 
as usual, then nodded. Marie’s an- 
swering comment was the eye-open- 
er. 

“I wouldn’t say that,” she re- 
marked. “One of you should tell him 
I understand. I wouldn’t want him 



to feel too unhappy about it all.” 

I looked at Joe. He looked at me, 
and raised the eyebrow on the side of 
his face away from the sub. Neither 
of us had ever realized that forgive- 
ness could depend less on “what” 
than on “why.” 

I turned to the pad once more, 
and wrote. 

“If you really feel that way. I’ll 
tell him. I’ll be staying down here 
to help Joe and should see Bert 
again often enough. I’m almost as 
good a linguist as he is and may 
make some headway in untangling 
this ghastly excuse for a communica- 
cation system.” 

I thought it better not to make 
any comments about possible inter- 
esting language teachers. If Marie 
had another change of mind even 
from mere jealousy. I’d never be 
able to make any more decisions. 
This one felt too nice to waste, after 
all the uncertainty that had pre- 
ceded it. END

Dear Editor: 

Why, why, why did you let Farm- 
er end The Felled Star where he 
did? Is there to be a sequel? Not 
only was it a wonderful story which 
he seems to have ended right in the 
middle, but the Gaughan illustra- 
tions for it were the best Tve seen 
yet by him. 

To end the story this way is as 
if Tolkien had ended The Lord of 
the Rings with the Fellowship still 
in Lothlorien! 

And while Ihn writing, what ever 
happened to David Bunch? 

Lin Carter’s comments on the Na- 
tional Fantasy Fan Federation, 
while (in my opinion) rather un- 
fairly critical, have brought us quite 
a few new members. — Cuyler War-

Dear Editor: 

You have increased the price of 
If to 60c due to rising costs. You 
now have 10c per copy more and I 
hope that this will be used for im- 
provements that are badly needed. 

First is the art work. Perhaps 
you could pay cover artjsts more, 
to do a better job. I know without a 
doubt that Morrow and Gaughan 
are good artists but rarely show it. 
Wood should do cover art too. Your 



art work is the worst part of the 
magazine at present. 

Also I think that full length 
plates, although more expensive, are 
much more suitable to the cover. The 
July and August covers show this, 
especially the August cover by Mor- 
row, the first good one since March. 

I was expecting more pages of If 
with TF.O.T. gone. You are now 
cramped for space again, which is 
the reason you added pages in the 
first place. Moskowitz article, al- 
though good and I would like to see 
more of, took up space that could 
have been used for another story. I 
would like to have seen the letter 
column expanded and a book review 
added but there is no room. 

As it is in increasing your price 
you have made If the most expen- 
sive mag around and I expect more 
for my money, including Rogue Star, 

About selling more copies, I think 
that there is a ready market all to 
v/illing to buy your mag, but have 
no knowledge of its existence. I read 
SF two years before I knew there 
was such things as Science Fiction 
Magazines. It was another year be- 
fore I found out where to send to 
get them. Isn’t there some way that 
you can make people aware of your 
mags? Wliy not run small ads in 
the back of paperbacks or some-

where. Somebody suggested a sick 
millionaire and I am going to take 
the suggestion seriously. Any sick 
millionaires out there? 

Finally, get Delany’s next novel.

• ‘‘Most expensive sf mag around 
How come? There are exactly three 
sf mags in this country — not 
counting the ones that are mostly 
devoted to resuscitating ancient 
stories, or that lean heavily on pure 
fantasy. All three of them cost the 
same price. Of the three, If has by 
actual count the most words of 
science fiction in each issue. Count 
them yourself if you doubt it! — 
Editor.

Dear Editor: 

The letter column in the August 
If was; perhaps, one of the best to 
date. I agree with much of what 
John Goldsmith had to say about 
the trite techniques of some stories 
in our genre. Every time I see an- 
other story-written-in-letter-form 
piece my gorge rises.' Keith Laumer, 
who writes some of the best action 
and packs a great deal of excitement 
into what he turns out, seems to be 
plagued by the character who just 
happens to stumble across a space- 
ship disguised as a silo {Spaceman 
in the last few issues of If) or the 
college student who picks up a book 
on hypnotism and immediately opens 
up another dimension just by mes- 
merizing'^ himself . Admittedly, Laum- 
er used a similar technique in the 
recent The Day Before Forever, and 
handled it extremely well. But what- 
ever happened to the Laumer of 
“End as a Hero*’ and “World- 
master”? Those moved like a Van 
Vogt piece, chocked full of — not 



only action, but — malice, evil, mys- 
tery and wonder. Perhaps less Re- 
tief and a few more things that give 
more latitude than the Bondish gal- 
actic diplomat-spy will bring that 
beloved and prolific talent to the 
fore again. 

Agreed again with Goldsmith: I 
would rather see a story where — 
although there are no mathmeticians 
and ball-of-fire young scientists who 
land on a world and change it from 
a barren ball of rock to a paradise 
in six short weeks — the hero has 
human problems besides scientific 
ones and solves them along with or 
at the same time with the scientific 
ones. Zelazny is great at this. So is 
Samuel R. Delany. 

So, also some kudos. 7/ is improv- 
ing all the time. At first, I thought 
it was going to stand as the last bas- 
tion of the total science tale and 
the space opera (which all of us 
enjoy), but now I see it publishing 
both the new wave and the old and 
the wavelets in between. Good. Fine. 
And with cover improvement too. 
Not a really horrible cover since 
May of 1963 when you evidently 
tried to capture the Camp faction. 
The sixty cents is justified^ cer- 
tainly. 

In closing, if C.ere is anyone who 
is infatuated with Zelazny, Delany, 
the old Bester, or any combination 
thereof and would like to correspond' 
and is liberal, twenty-one, and, 
slightly insane,. please feel free to do* 
so. — Dean R. Koontz, 528 Walnut 
St., Apt. 5, Lemoyne, Penna. 17043. 

• Good news for all Zelazny fans : 
he’ll be back in our Hugo-winning 
magazine next month with a stun- 
ning short story — for which Peder- 
son has provided a vivid cover. See 
you next month! — The Editor
