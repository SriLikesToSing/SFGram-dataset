Looking Ahead? 



You must be, or you wouldn’t be reading this magazine. 
Looking ahead, for instance, into the future of technology, 
sociology, ecology, space and time and terrestrials and 
extraterrestrials. 

But what about looking ahead to: 

• Saving money? (The longer your subscription to IF, the 
more free issues you get.) 

• Saving steps? (A subscription brings IF right to your 
mailbox, irrespective of heat, cold, snow, rain, gloom 
of night — and mailed flat, to boot.) 

• Saving time? (You get your copies at least a week be- 
fore the newsstands receive theirs.) 

• Saving your temper? (IF can and often does sell out; 
with a subscription there’s no need to hunt from stand 
to stand.) 

IN SHORT, IF YOU’RE REALLY LOOKING AHEAD, 
YOU’LL EITHER USE THE COUPON BELOW OR SEND 
IN YOUR ORDER ON ANY OLD SHEET OF PAPER.

OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL 



TWTrites Pinky Finger, Mussent 
” Point, Ind., speaking for many 
readers who offered the same sug- 
gestion: “I like your editorials and 
I like letter columns. Why not com- 
bine the two, whenever you have 
enough good letters on hand, so the 
people who like your editorials but 
dislike letter columns won’t obect? 
By interpolating your comments in 
parentheses and italics” (Like 
this? ) “you still could have a letter 
column, only in editorial form. But 
what’s eating readers who don’t like 
letter columns?” (Research has 
given us the answer, but it just isn't 
true that reading letter columns 
is like going through someone else’s 
pockets. Mail published here was 
meant to be read. Mail not meant 
to be read is simply not published, 
and “Please do not print this” dis- 
tinguishes one from the other.) 

Vic Ryan, Springfield, 111., says: 
“Advertising keeps most magazines 
and newspapers alive. Can you do 
it on circulation alone?” (Yes. But 
we like advertising and our audi- 
ence, generally a well-heeled 
bunch, interested in all sorts of 



products and services, is for it. Ad- 
vertisers will kindly take note. The 
income comes in handy, of course, 
for improvements. ) 

Frank Schwarz, Levittown, 
N. Y.: “I have noticed with awe 
and wonder that the June issue 
reached me on March 30.” (We 
explained in the last issue that deal- 
ers send back magazines dated the 
current month. T o avoid premature 
returns, we have to date issues the 
month before they’re due to come 
off sale. It’s a trade practice that 
we like no better than you do, but 
we can’t change it.) “You might do 
well to date the issues say 200 or 
300 years in advance and drop the 
prefix ‘Science,’ thus coming up 
with a practically factual magazine, 
which due to the terrific efficiency 
of its staff happens to come out a 
bit early. How about it?” ( If dating 
issues 200 or 300 years ahead be- 
came the trade practice, there 
would be no how-about-it. An am- 
nesiac or time traveler, right now, 
today, stuck in a small town with 
no newspaper, would have some 
job finding out the date from our 



6 



GALAXY 



current magazines. But not enough 
of our readers are in that predica- 
ment — as tar as we know — to in- 
duce us to buck newsstand cus- 
tom.) 

John McGowan, no address: “I 
am enjoying your experimenting 
with your new format” ( So are we ) 
“and hope that you never settle 
down to a regular format” (Not a 
chance ) “and just keep experiment- 
ing with various layouts.” (Like 
this? ) 

John Buckelew, Rogers, Ark.: 
“With your bimonthly schedule I 
think you have hit a new high in 
quality and I hope you can mantain 
it.” (We can — on a bimonthly 
schedule. There is some argument 
from individual exceptions to the 
statistical fact that magazine read- 
ership turns over every five years 
or so — exceptions that we ac- 
knowledge and are thankful for. 
But can it be disputed that there 
is also an author and artist turnover 
— with, of course, the usual per- 
centage of exceptions and occa- 
sional returnees? We miss the ones 
who are gone for good and wish the 
others would contribute more 
often, but the real solution is the 
same as it’s always been in every 
held: new talent must be brought 
in. And in it’s coming — enough for 
a high-quality issue every other 
month. What would we do if the 
volume increased? If you owned a 
magazine what would you do? 
Right. So would we.) 

OTHER PEOPLE’S MAIL 



Tascha Lorenz, Beverly Farms, 
Mass.: “Are you the Herbert Gold 
that has occasional stories in Play- 
boy Magazine? If so, congratula- 
tions— they’re great!” ( Aren’t they? 
But I’m Horace, no relation, and I 
don’t know the man, only his work, 
which I strenuously admire.) 

Fritz Leiber, Chicago, 111.: “Stu- 
dents! Teachers! Start a science fic- 
tion club in your school. Have 
interesting meetings and meet 
people who read science fiction. For 
information on how to start a club, 
write to Science Through Science 
Fiction, Box No. 9148, Chicago 90, 
111.” (The purpose behind this 
needs an entire editorial. Our sur- 
veys have shown that nearly every 
theoretician and researcher was, as 
the call above says, led into science 
through science fiction. These same 
surveys show that science fiction is 
unknown, or all but, to people in 
the practical end of science. Con- 
trary experience, however consid- 
erable it may seem, is statistically 
unuseful; job opportunities and mi- 
litary service classification far out- 
weigh science fiction in attracting 
entrants. But practical science waits 
on basic research — every practical 
advance was once just an idea or a 
speculative guess. Russia, knowing 
how the extrapolative technique of 
science fiction leads to extrapola- 
tive work in the lab, is urging 
writers into science fiction, under 
orders to "Think, damn you, 
think!” to win young recruits to 



7 



basic research. We can’t and 
needn’t imitate their bullwhip 
methods; our science fiction out- 
classes theirs in every conceivable 
way. Getting it to responsive young 
minds is the proplem. When sci- 
ence fiction’s role in basic research 
is officially understood here all 
youngsters will be systematically 
exposed to it, and then there will 
be an upsurge in basic research to 
dwindle even these past peak de- 
cades. Until then, the job must be 
done by all who see the necessity, 
and Science Through Science Fic- 
tion in the schools is a Class-A an- 
swer.) 

Vincent E. Treacy, Dedham, 
Mass.: “Will you please put Sci- 
ence Fiction back on your cover 
and title page? In this field, yours 
has been the most influential mag- 
azine — bar none — in the Fifties. 
Now you seem to want to cut your 
association with science fiction. 
Please don’t!” (We never intended 
to. As explained previously, we sus- 
pect that potential readers may be 
attracted to the magazine but put 
off by the term Science Fiction. 
Thafs what we’re testing right 
now. Term on or term off, though, 
this is and will remain a science 
fiction magazine.) 

Phyllis Ballin, New York: “As 
one editor, though a small one, to 
another, may I congratulate you 
and your staff . The editorials, 
in which you go to great lengths to 
make the reader feel as if” ( As 



if? ) “he were an actively con- 
sulted member of the magazine, 
made a fine impression. Reading 
good science fiction has been one 
of my pleasures for a long while. I 
thank you for your part in it. I’ve 
enclosed a recent copy of the 
Ladle” ( official publication N.Y. 
State Assn, of Plumbing Contrac- 
tors). “Space-fact rather than sci- 
ence fiction, I thought you might 
enjoy the lead article.” (I did. Lead 
paragraph: “The Pan American 
Boeing 707 flashed across the skies 
at 575 miles per hour, making air- 
plane headlines, and incidentally, 
plumbing history. Flying at an al- 
titude of over 7 miles high, taking 
only six and a half hours to get 
from New York to London, the 
mammoth craft bears in' its belly 
the first flush toilet ever to get off 
the ground.” Ingeniously done and 
a great passenger comforter, but 
space-fact? Not at 7 miles. My 
money is on the plumbers, though, 
to unseat the problems of weight- 
lessness when called in for esti- 
mates.) 

E. D. Schafer, Dickinson, Tex.: 
“In 1886 my family moved near a 
fine, well-selected library — quite 
a rarity in a small Texas cow town 
— containing a full set of Jules 
Verne. That started me off and I’ve 
read all the s-f I could get since 
then — Wells, Frank Reade, Jr., 
etc., even one writer, name for- 
gotten, who dealt with a trip to the

WHERE ARE WE GOING IN SPACE? 



You’ll find the answers in SPACE AGE 
— America's only magazine that “bridges 
the gap” between the technical journals 
and your local newspaper reports. 




ARE YOU AWARE that you hove a 
''personal stake in all the big missile 
shots, moon probes, satellite launchings, 
earth-bound space tests being made today? 

Weil, you have. The age of space Is 
exploding all around us. Government and 
Industry are spending billions in research 
and explorotion so that generations to 
come will find a nevr kind of life — in 
space! Yes, v^e have already crossed the 
threshold of the greatest age in the his> 
tory of ManI And yet — 

Millions of Americans actually do not 
know or understand what it is all about 
when a missile or rocket is fired — when 
a satellite sends back its mysterious 'Voice" 
from space when a volunteer enters a 
space research test chamber — when a new 
project is announced — what it costs . 

Not because they don't want to know 
but because they are lost somewhere in 
that big gap — informationwise — between 



technical publications and local news 
reports. 

Now that "gap" has been bridged. 
And here's how — 

SPACE AGE, a fascinating new maga- 
zine, shows you —in plain, non-technical, 
everyday language and superb illustrations 
— what this thrilling new age of space is 
all about — Man and Science, places and 
events, ideas and dreams. SPACE AGE 
explains clearly and factually, informatively 
and entertainingly, the conquest of space, 
Mankind's plunge into a booming new era. 

MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE 

SPACE AGE is excitingly different from 
anything ever published before — and you

In the awfulness of

everything was the 
nightmare opposite of itself . 

and here was where 
Len Mattern found his goal! 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



I 

L en Mattern paused before 
the door of the Golden Apple 
Bar. The elation that had 
carried him up to this point sud- 
denly wasn’t there any more. Lyd- 
dy couldn’t have changed too 
much, he’d kept telling himself. 
After all, it hadn’t been so very 
long since he’d seen her. Now he 
found himself counting the years 
. and they added up to a long 
time. 

But it was too late to go back 
now. A familiar thought. The com-

SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME

mitment was moral only, and to 
himself, no one else — the same 
way it had been that other time, 
the time that had changed the di- 
rection of his whole life, and, pos- 
sibly, of all other lives in his uni- 
verse as well. There was only one 
human being with whom he kept 
faith — himself. Therefore, the 
commitment was a binding one. 

He pushed open the door and 
went in. 

He saw Lyddy at the end of the 
bar, surrounded by a group of men. 
Lyddy had always been sur- 
rounded by a group of men, he re- 
membered, unless she was up in 
her room entertaining just one. 
She half-turned and he saw her 
face. The sun-pink lips were 
parted, her eyes still comparable 
to the heavens of Earth. She stood 
erect and lithe and slender. 

She had not changed at all! 

' I '^HE tension that had built up 
inside him snapped with the 
weight of sudden relief. He lurched 
against a small hokur-motal table. 
It rocked crazily. The zhapik who 
owned the Golden Apple came out 
from behind the carved screen 
where he'd been sitting segregated 
from the customers. Many of the 
zhapiq, who had been native to 
Erytheia before the Federation 
took over, owned businesses cater- 
ing to humans. It might be degrad- 
ing, but it paid well. 

“Maybe you’ve had enough to 



drink. Captain?” he suggested. 
“Maybe you’d like to come back 
another time?” 

“I haven’t had anything at all 
to drink," Mattern said curtly. 
“What’s more, I haven’t come for 
a drink.” 

He strode across the room, firm- 
ly now, and brushed aside the men 
who clustered around Lyddy. “I’ve 
come for you,” he told her. 

She didn’t say anything, just 
looked him up and down. The 
beautiful blue eyes skillfully ap- 
praised his worth as a man and 
as a customer. Then she smiled 
and patted the gilded hair that 
streamed past her bare shoulders 
to her narrow waist. 

“You’re not a Far Planets man,” 
she said. “How come you know 
about me?” 

Funny he should feel disap- 
pointed. Sure, he’d been thinking 
of her all those years, but he’d 
never expected her to have been 
thinking of him. Yet he found him- 
self blurting out, “Don’t you re- 
member me, Lyddy?” Then he 
cursed himself; first because he 
didn’t want her to remember him 
as he had been; second, because 
he knew every man who’d ever 
slept with her — or a woman like 
her — would ask the same ques- 
tion. And, of course, she’d have the 
standard answer, something like 
“Why, of course I remember you, 
honey. I’m just not good at 
names.” 



12 



GALAXY 



But she just looked at him 
levelly. “No, dear, I’m afraid I 
don’t remember you,” she said. 
Then a tiny frown gathered on her 
smooth forehead. “Seems to me I 
would’ve, though. When did I meet 
you?” 

“Oh, years ago! I was just a 
kid!” 

She flushed, and he realized 
he’d been a little tactless. If he was 
no kid any more, neither would 
she be. Still, she looked as young 
as she ever had, and he, he knew, 
looked younger. 

He didn’t want her to probe fur- 
ther, so he hastily made an ap- 
pointment with her for an even- 
ing later that week. As he left, he 
could hear her saying, in a bewil- 
dered voice, “I could’ve sworn 
there was somebody with him 
when he came in.” 

And he quickened his steps. 

^HE had the same room — a 
^ warm luxurious chamber, high 
up in the Golden Apple Hotel. I,,yd- 
dy herself was the same, too, just as 
he remembered her. 

Afterward, as they lay together 
in the blackness, she asked, “Can 
you in the dark, Captain?” 

He was surprised, and then, 
thinking about it, not so surprised. 
“Of course not, no more than you 
can! Whatever made you ask 
that?” 

“I— feel like somebody’s looking 
at me.” 



He rolled over on his side, so 
his body was as far away from 
hers as possible. He didn’t want 
her to feel the sudden rise of ten- 
sion in him. Something’s got to be 
done about this, he thought. I can’t 
put up with it now. 

“Why don’t you say anything, 
honey?” her anxious voice came 
out of the darkness. 

“Will you marry me, Lyddy?” 
he said. 

He could hear the intake of her 
breath. “Ask me again in the morn- 
ing,” she told him wearily. He 
knew what she must be thinking: 
Men who hadn’t had a woman for 
a long time sometimes did strange 
things. In the morning, she would 
wake up and he would be gone. 

Only, when morning came, he 
was still there. Two weeks later, 
they were married. 

II 

¥ YDDY was curious about her 
husband-to-be and kept trying 
to find out all about him. Fortu- 
nately, in the code of the Far 
Planets, a man’s past was his own 
business, so he was able to be 
evasive without actually lying to 
her. Not that he had any scruples, 
about lying; it was simply easier to 
tell as few stories as possible, 
rather than worry about keeping 
them straight. 

But it was all right to ask about 
a man’s present. “Do you have 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



13 



anybody, Len? Relations, any- 
thing like that?” 

He frowned a little, remennber- 
ing the boy on Fairhurst. “No,” he 
said, “I have no relatives. I have 
nobody.” 

Her face fell. “It would’ve been 
kind of nice to have a ready-made 
family.” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” he said. 
“There are times when it’s better 
to have no family.” 

“Yeah, I guess you’re right. 
They might not approve of me.” 
“We’ll be everything to each 
other,” he assured her. 

There was a ghost of a sound 
then — a laugh or a sigh. He hoped 
she didn’t hear it. 

The zhapik insisted on giving 
Lyddy’s wedding, even though he 
himself could, of course, be present 
only behind the screen. Most peo- 
ple said the old E-T bastard knew 
a good piece of publicity when he 
saw it, but Mattern thought it 
might be out of genuine sentiment. 
He was closer to aliens than most 
men in this sector, any sector. Al- 
though he had originally hailed 
from the Far Planets, he had trav- 
eled widely and lost his prejudices. 
His best friend wasn’t human. 

Every human in Erytheia City 
was invited to the wedding. Mat- 
tern’s four crewmen came. Three 
were middle-aged and had sailed 
with Mattern for years, but his 
most recent acquisition was a 
young man, almost a boy. Some- 



thing Raines, his name was. He 
kept staring at Lyddy as if he had 
never seen a beautiful woman be- 
fore, though, coming from Earth, 
he must have seen many. Mattern 
was gratified at this tribute to his 
choice. 

“Only four crewmen!” Lyddy 
said, looking disappointed. “You 
must have a small ship.” 

Mattern smiled. “Not too small.” 
He could see she didn’t believe 
him. 

Lyddy didn’t seem to be enjoy- 
ing her wedding. She kept glanc- 
ing over her shoulder all through 
the ceremony and during the re- 
ception. Finally Mattern had to 
ask her what was wrong, although 
he would rather not have known. 

“Y’know, hon,” she whispered, 
“I keep having the funniest feel- 
ing there’s somebody extra here, 
somebody who doesn’t belong. I 
haven’t quite seen him; he always 
seems to slip by so fast, but I don’t 
even think he’s a man.” 

“Don’t be silly, Lyddy,” he said, 
almost sharply. “You know no ex- 
traterrestrial would dare to crash 
a human party!” 

“I guess not.” But she still kept 
looking over her shoulder. 

'^HE zhapik invited them to re- 
main at the Golden Apple 
Hotel as his guests for as long as 
they liked. They stayed two 
months. Then Mattern told his 
wife it was time they started plan- 



14 



GALAXY 



ning their future, decided where 
they were going to live. “You’ll 
want a home of your own,” he said. 
“Otherwise you’ll get bored.” 

“I’m never bored,” said Lyddy. 
“But where will we go? I mean 
what system?” 

“Well, Erytheia is a pleasure 
planet, so I thought we might as 
well stay here. There are some at- 
tractive residential neighborhoods 
on this continent — or, if you’d 
prefer, the other one.” 

Her face fell. “You mean we’re 
going to stay here?" 

He didn’t know why he was so 
anxious to remain on Erytheia. 
Mainly it was because for no good 
reason he found himself disliking 
the idea of making the Jump with 
her. “If you’d rather, I could build 
you a city of your own, Lyddy,” 
he tempted her. 

It was obvious that even if she 
had taken this seriously, it still 
wouldn’t be what she wanted. “I’d 
like to go away from here,” she 
told him. “Far away.” 

“Just because you want a change 
— is that it?” 

She hesitated. “That’s partly it 
But there’s more. Somehow, ever 
since we’ve been married, I keep 
feeling all the time like — like I’m 
being watched.” 

His smile was strained. “Well, 
naturally, in ’Rytheia City, people 
will tend to — watch. Let’s go far 
away from where people are. 
There’s an island on this planet. 



way off in the western seas. I’ll 
buy you that island, Lyddy. I’ll 
build you a villa there — a chateau, 
a castle, whatever you want.” 

But she shook her golden head. 
“No, nothing like that. I want to 
go to another system. It’s not that 
I don’t want to be where people 
are. I like crowds. I just want to 
be where there are different peo- 
ple.” 

He forced another smile. 
“What’s gotten into you, Lyddy? 
In the old days, you used to be 
so calm.” 

S HE wriggled her shoulders un- 
comfortably. “I keep seeing 
things, shadows that shouldn’t be 
there, reflections of nothing. Only, 
when I turn, they don’t get out of 
the way fast enough to be nothing.” 
“They?” he repeated. 

“I only see one at a time, but 
I don’t know if it’s always the 
same one.” She shivered again. 

“It must be your nerves.” He 
went on resolutely, “Maybe you 
do need a change of scene.” Ac- 
tually it was absurd to feel so ap- 
prehensive about the Jump. She’d 
be safer in hyperspace in his ship 
than anywhere else in the uni- 
verse. And a large metropolis 
might provide distractions to take 
her mind off — shadows. “How 
would you like to go to Burdon?” 
“That would be real nice!” But 
she was not as enthusiastic about 
it as he had expected.

Che laid a hesitant hand on his 
^ arm. “Honey,” she began ten- 
tatively, “you— you seem to spend 
so much time all by yourself. Do 
I bore you?” 

‘Of course not, dear,” he said 
awkwardly. “It just seems that 
way to you. Pressure of busi- 
ness . .” 

“But why do you play chess 
with yourself all the time?” 

“I’ve spent so much time in 
space that I got into the habit 
of playing alone. Many spacemen 
do that.” 

She bit her painted lip. “Some- 
times — sometimes when you’re 
alone in your room, I hear your 
voice. Why do you talk to your- 
self?” 

It was an effort for him to meet 
the beautiful, blank blue eyes. 
“When you’re alone a lot of the 
time, sweetheart, you have to hear 
the sound of a voice even if it’s 
your own, or you start hearing 
voices.” 

“But you have me,” she said. 
“You’re not alone. But you still 
do it.” 

“Old habits are hard to break, 
dear.” 

She looked up at him, trying to 
force her way past the wall in his 
eyes. God help her, he thought, if 
she ever succeeds. “Would you 
like me to learn to play chess?” 

“Would you like to?” 

“I — don’t know,” she mur- 
mured doubtfully. “I’ve never been 

16 



much good at mind things. But I 
want to be everything to you.” 
“You are, sweetheart.” He 
stooped and kissed her. “Don’t 
force yourself to do anything you 
don’t want to for my sake. I’m 
used to playing alone.” 

“But I want you to do things 
with me!” 

“I’ll do everything else with 
you,” he promised. 

He went to his room and shut 
the door behind him. But she had 
heard him talking there, so sounds 
must carry through. When they got 
a place of their own, he would 
have the walls and doors sound- 
proofed. Meanwhile, it would be 
safer to go to the ship. 

As he came out of the hotel 
door, he collided with a man who 
looked familiar. It took him a mo- 
ment to identify the sullen, star- 
tled face as belonging to that 
newest member of his crew, young 
Something Raines. 

“Hello there,” he said. “Were 
you coming to see me?” 

“N-no, sir. I was just coming in 
for a — a pack of Earth smoke- 
sticks. I can’t stand those stinking 
native brands!” The boy spoke 
with a viciousness so unsuited to 
the subject that it was almost fun- 
ny. He flushed, perhaps realizing 
this, perhaps remembering that 
Mattern was reputed to hail from 
this sector. “It’s a question of what 
you’re used to, see?” he mumbled. 
“Of course,” Mattern agreed 



GALAXY 



pleasantly. “This is your first time 
on Erytheia, is it?” 

“Yes, my first time here.” 

“Are you enjoying it?” 

“Well, I dunno exactly.” -There 
was doubt in the boy’s blue eyes. 
Something in them seemed famil- 
iar, more familiar than just recog- 
nizing one of his own crewmen. He 
had a look of — who? Of Lyddy? 
But that was absurd. 

^T^HE doubt in Raines’ face had 
changed to fear, and Mattern 
realized that he himself must have 
been just standing there, staring at 
him. He laughed. “You’re sup- 
posed to enjoy Erytheia; it’s a 
pleasure planet.” 

“Well,” the boy said, choosing 
his words with care, “it’s a pretty 
enough place, but it’s set up more 
for people with money. I mean 
there’s nothing here for fellows 
like me; the pleasure’s for the 
rich people only. Even the smoke- 
sticks cost almost twice as much 
as anywhere else.” 

“We’ll probably be leaving soon, 
so you’ll only have to stick it a 
little while longer.” Mattern’s hand 
went to his pocket, then fell to his 
side as he saw the look on the boy’s 
face. If Raines was proud. Mat- 
tern would not offend him by of- 
fering him money. “Maybe you’ll 
find Burdon more to your liking.” 
“Oh, yes, sir!” The young space- 
man’s face was virtually radiant. 
He must have a girl on Burdon, 



Mattern thought, amused. 

As he walked over to the land- 
ing field where his ship was 
moored, he was troubled by the 
memory of the boy’s voice. Not 
that it was familiar — but there 
was the faintest hint of a Far 
Planets accent. Provincials as a 
rule didn’t go to the terrestrial 
space schools, but it was, of course, 
possible. Raines must have had an 
Earth education, because Mattern 
followed the rule of the Marine 
service and never hired a man who 
didn’t have a degree from one of 
the space schools. He must look at 
the boy’s records as soon as he 
got a chance. 

The Hesperian Queen was not 
a small vessel. She was one of the 
newest, fastest, most fully auto- 
mated models. Moreover, she was 
large and she glittered like a dwarf 
star. Lyddy would get a surprise 
when she came to see the ship. 

Mattern greeted the crew mem- 
ber on watch and went up to his 
luxuriously appointed cabin— suite, 
really. Inside, a chessboard was set 
up, as its counterpart was set up 
in his hotel room, one side in the 
light from a porthole, the other 
in a corner full of shadows. 

The pieces were not only in po- 
sition, but a game had been started. 
Mattern sat down on the bright 
side and moved a piece. 

“Lyddy’s aware of you,” he told 
the shadows. “She has no idea of 
what you are, of course. But she 

17 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



knows you’re around, kqyres. She’s 
half seen you and it’s beginning 
to bother her. It’s beginning to 
bother me, too.” 

13 ART of the shifting grayness 
flowed over the board. When 
it receded, a knight had changed 
its place. “Truly, I have tried to 
be careful,” a quiet, rather tired 
voice said out of a darkness at the 
heart of the shadows, an area that 
was tenuously substant. “Is it cer- 
tain that you yourself have not in 
some way given her cause for sus- 
picion?” 

“Quite certain. I’ve watched my- 
self night and day.” Mattern 
smiled ruefully. “Which is damned 
hard when you’re on your honey- 
moon.” 

“Is there anyone else who might 
have spoken of these thing to 
her?” the kqyres asked. 

“No one.” Then Mattern re- 
membered the young spaceman 
he had met coming into the hotel, 
who seemed to have a look of 
Lyddy. But that was nonsensical. 
Looking like her didn’t mean talk- 
_ ing to her. In any case, what would 
Raines know that he could tell 
her? Silly to be so suspicious. The 
Golden Apple was one of the few 
places in Er 5 rtheia City where one 
could get Earth smokesticks. “No 
one,” Mattern repeated. “No one 
at all.” 

The patterns shifted and dark- 
ened. “Then I must be getting 

18 



careless. I am growing old.” 
“Anyone can make a slip,” Mat- 
tern said reassuringly. “Just try to 
be a little more careful, that’s all.” 
He moved a rook. 

The grayness crept out over the 
board, touched a bishop, hesitated, 
and moved to a pawn. He is getting 
old, Mattern thought pityingly, as 
he took the pawn. Once I could 
never beat bint. Now I win two 
games out of three. 

“But you are content with the 
woman?” his partner asked anxious- 
ly. “You are not disappointed with 
her in any way? She pleases you as 
much today as she did when first 
you set eyes on her?” 

“Of course she does! You’d think 
it was you who’d been dreaming of 
her all these years, not me.” 

“I suppose we shared those 
dreams . .” 

“And you’d never seen her.” 
Mattern stared intently at the shad- 
ow. “Are you disappointed, then?” 
“Of course not. You know that to 
me a human woman is merely an 
object of art. And she is very beau- 
tiful. But I thought she might not 
have come up to your expectations. 
Reality often falls short of dreams.” 
The shadow’s voice tautened. 
“Has she changed much?” 

“Very little,” Mattern said, ab- 
sorbed once more in the game. 
“You’d think only a year or two 
had passed. Surprising how women 
do it.” 

The shadow sighed. “Surprising,” 
GALAXY 



it agreed, its voice relaxing. “But 
then the female sex is mysterious.” 

' I ■'HEY played on a while in si- 
lence. The kqyres finally spoke. 
“You will need a lot of money to 
provide an establishment fitting for 
so lovely a lady.” 

“I have a lot of money,” Mattern 
said. “More than enough.” 

The kqyres flickered so violently 
that Mattern’s eyes hurt. “Not 
enough for the things she deserves 
to have. Jewels, palaces, planets . .” 
“One thing I know would make 
it a lot more comfortable for her,” 
Mattern suggested. “If only you 
didn’t have to be close to me all the 
time, kqyres. If only you could stay 
on the ship even when I’m not there. 
Not that I don’t enjoy your com- 
pany,” he added quickly, “but she 
seems to be highly strung.” 

“Do you think I like the situation 
any better than you? But this is the 
way the mbretersha has ordered it.” 
“I suppose she knows what she’s 
doing,” Mattern sighed. In any case, 
the mbretersha’s orders were abso- 
lute and could not be contravened 
— otherwise, at least one universe 
might be destroyed. There were 
still so many things he didn’t under- 
stand and was not likely to learn. 

“Strange,” he went on pensively, 
“that Lyddy should have seen you, 
when I hardly can, and I know 
you’re here.” He knew, too, that the 
kqyres was deliberately vibrating 
out of phase, so that the horror of 



his appearance in this continum 
would be spared not only those he 
chanced to meet, but also himself. 
There was always the danger of 
passing a mirror. Knowing how the 
kqyres looked in his own universe, 
knowing how he himself looked in 
the kqyres’ universe, Mattern 
didn’t doubt that any revelation 
would be a frightful one. However, 
he couldn’t help being curious. 

“I still think someone must have 
told her where to stare,” the shad- 
ow said, “and what for.” 

“Don’t be absurd!” Mattern 
snapped, outraged at the idea that 
his carefully kept secret might not 
be a secret at all. “Just try to be 
careful when she’s around. Vibrate 
harder, or something.” 

“I shall do my poor best.” The 
shadowy one hesitated. “Do you not 
think that if perhaps you were to 
tell her the truth — ” 

“Lord, no!” Mattern exclaimed. 
“She’d take a fit!” 

“Once you would not have 
spoken of her that way,” the kqyres 
said reproachfully. 

“I didn’t mean it the way it 
sounded,” Mattern tried to explain. 
“It’s just that — well, by now I 
hardly remember what the truth is 
myself.” 

Ill 

ID that truth go back fifteen 
years, to the time he had met 
the kqyres, twenty years to the time

19 



he had first seen Lyddy? Or even 
further back than that? Did it go 
back, say, twenty-four years, to the 
time when he was sixteen and had 
killed his stepfather? He could still 
see Karl Brodek lying there with 
his head crushed, could still feel the 
terror rising in him at what he had 
done . 

Then he had turned and fled the 
small community on Fairhurst — 
one of the Clytemnestra planets — 
and made for the capital, where he 
shipped out on one of the small 
tramp freighters that voyaged 
among the planets of that system. 
None of the four other planets was 
human-inhabitable, but two had 
mining stations, and one had a na- 
tive civilization advanced enough 
to make trading practicable, though 
not very profitable. 

T^OR the next four years, he 
drifted from one tenth-rate 
ship to another, one ill-paid job to 
another. In all this time, he never 
left the Clytemnestra System. As 
soon as he was satisfied that his 
former neighbors were not going to 
set the law on his trail, he had no 
desire to go away. It wasn’t place- 
liking that kept him; it was dread 
of the Jump. 

Most spacemen never do quite 
get over their dread of the hyper- 
space Jump, but with Len the dread 
amounted almost to a mania. He 
was ashamed of the feeling, espe- 
cially since he suspected he’d 



picked up that extra dollop of terror 
from the creatures on the native 
planet. 

Self-respecting colonials didn’t 
associate with non-humans, but 
during those first years of fear that 
his fellow men were hunting him, 
he’d felt safe only with the flluska. 
He learned a little of their language, 
and he spent such spare time as he 
had on Liman, their planet. He 
couldn’t breathe the atmosphere, 
but there were the trading domes; 
nobody minded if he used them 
when there was no trade going on. 

The flluska were a religious peo- 
ple, with gods and demons similar 
to those of the terrestrial cosmo- 
gonies. Only, while their gods lived 
conventionally in the sky, their de- 
mons lived in hyperspace. Len was 
too unsophisticated himself to won- 
der how so primitive a people could 
have evolved such a concept as 
hyperspace in their theology. He 
merely grew to share their terror of 
it. 

The year Len was twenty, the 
Perseus, one of the star freighters 
that made the long haul from Cas- 
tor to Capella, found itself in Fair- 
hurst Station short one deckhand. 
The man they’d shipped out with 
was in jail, waiting to see whether 
a manslaughter or assault charge 
was going to be lodged against him. 
The ship could not afford to wait. 
The station was scoured for a re- 
placement and Len Mattern was 
the best man they could find.

GALAXY 



Normally the starships did not 
take on untrained hands. Even the 
lowliest crewman was supposed to 
have spent a minimum number of 
years at the space schools, because 
in theory, all promotions came from 
the ranks, even in the merchant 
service. But in spite of his lack of 
training, they offered him the job. 
The bigline ships never liked to sail 
shorthanded; in case of trouble, that 
could be a basis for legal action. 

T EN knew the opportunity of- 
fered him was a dazzling one 
— not only far more money than 
he’d ever seen before, but the 
chance of breaking out of the sys- 
tem. He was afraid though, terribly 
afraid. “I’ve never made the Jump,” 
he told the second officer in a 
quavering voice. 

“You’ll never be a real spaceman 
until you do.” The second officer 
was patient, because he knew Mat- 
tern was his only chance of making 
the crew up to its full complement. 

“I’ve heard tell that — things 
change their shapes in Hyper- 
space.” 

“Maybe they do; maybe it’s their 
real shapes you see out there. Who’s 
to tell what the truth is?” 

Len licked dry lips and tried 
again. “They say there’re people- 
beings, anyway — living in hyper- 
space.” That tale he had heard 
from spacemen who had made the 
Jump. Even if he’d believed in the 
flluska’s demons, he would have 



had the good sense not to admit 
such a thing to a starship officer — 
a man of sophistication from the 
Near Planets, perhaps even Earth 
herself. Still, spacemen were no- 
torious myth-spinners. Perhaps he 
had made a fool of himself, any- 
way. 

But the second officer wasn’t 
laughing. “Federation law says we 
should have nothing to do with the 
creatures of hyperspace. If we leave 
them alone, they don’t bother us.” 
It would have been better if the 
officer had laughed at him and said 
there was nothing in hyperspace 
but space. “Will we see them?” 
“Does a ship going through or- 
dinary space see any of us?” the 
officer returned. “The creatures of 
hyperspace live on their own plan- 
ets, and we give those planets a 
wide berth. Simple as that.” He 
added, “What are you so afraid of, 
boy? Not a ship’s been lost in hy- 
perspace for over two centuries, and 
there haven’t been any blowups for 
years.” 

“Blowups?” Len repeated. 
“Accidents. A technical term. 
You’ve taken worse risks shipping 
out in those tincan tramps.” 

Finally, Len gave in — to his own 
common sense more than to the 
officer’s — and signed up for the 
voyage. He filled out the necessary 
forms — hundreds of them, it 
seemed like. When it came to each 
line for next of kin, he left a blank 
on every one. 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



21 



“Haven’t you any relatives at 
all?” the second officer asked, sur- 
prised. 

“Not a one.” Len didn’t bother to 
mention that half-brother back on 
Fairhurst; a five-year-old kid isn’t 
much kin to speak of. Besides, the 
boy probably didn’t even know he 
had a brother — he’d been less than 
a year old when Len left. One of the 
barren women must have adopted 
him and brought him up as her 
own. 

CO Len Mattern filled out all the 
^ papers and was inscribed on the 
ship’s rolls. And he made the terri- 
ble jump through hyperspace for 
the first time. 

People who traveled on space- 
ships only as passengers never 
could understand why the Jump 
was invariably referred to as “ter- 
rible.” That was because before the 
ship made the Jump they’d be given 
drugs, in their cocktails, in their 
food at dinner, or in their drinking 
water — and the next day they’d 
wake up and find they had slept 
right through the whole thing, so 
it couldn’t be so awful. Of course 
those who traveled around the uni- 
verse a lot were bound to catch on. 
Someday they’d miss a meal or not 
drink anything and they’d find 
themselves awake while the ship 
was Jumping. But the shipping lines 
didn’t take any chances and the 
aberrant passengers would also find 
themselves locked in their cabins 



with smooth metal shutters where 
the mirrors used to be. 

But one thing that couldn’t be 
helped: They couldn’t be stopped 
from looking down at themselves 
and seeing extra arms and legs; or 
finding no arms and legs at all, but 
tentacles instead; or that their skin 
had turned into shining scales or 
that there was an extra eye in the 
back of their head. And when the 
time came for another Jump, they 
would ask to be drugged. 

However, crewmen couldn’t be 
drugged. They had to be awake 
to tend the ship. The credo of the 
Space Service was that you couldn’t 
trust a machine to itself any more 
than you could trust an extrater- 
restrial, a non-human. If a man 
wasn’t in charge, ultimately every- 
thing would go to pot. That was 
part of the space tradition, like the 
primitive axes that hung on the 
bulkheads, so a man could smash 
his way to the modern firefighting 
equipment. Except, of course, that 
if fire really broke out, it would be 
quicker to press the button that 
sent the automatic fire-fighting ma- 
chines into immediate action. But 
still the axes hung there, because 
they had always hung there — and, 
like all the metal on the ship, they 
had to be kept polished. 

Each time a ship made the Jump, 
the crewmen stayed awake. They 
saw space and time change before 
their eyes. They saw their own fel- 
lows turn into monsters. It was an 



22 



GALAXY 



awful thing to see, even though they 
knew it wasn’t actually a change, 
but a shift to another aspect of 
themselves. Worse than the seeing 
was the feeling. It was like being 
turned inside out, organ by organ 
— your heart and your liver and 
your guts and all the rest, each 
carefully turned inside out, the way 
a woman takes off her gloves, 
smoothing each one with great pre- 
cision. The hellish part was that it 
didn’t hurt. A man felt as if he were 
being twisted and wrenched apart, 
and it didn’t hurt, and it was the 
wrongness of that more than any- 
thing else that — well, that was why 
the pay was so high on the star- 
ships. So many of them went mad. 

A LL this Len Mattem had heard 
of and had exjjected — though 
no amount of expectation could 
have braced him for that kind of 
reality. But there was more to it 
than he had heard, and it was the 
extra part that the second officer 
seemed curiously anxious to deny. 
“You saw nobody — nothing at the 
portholes,” he told Mattern after 
that first Jump. “You just imagined 
it.” 

Mattern had been a spaceman 
long enough to be able to distin- 
guish imagination from reality. Per- 
haps the creatures of hyperspace 
did live on planets, but it seemed 
they did not breathe the atmos- 
phere of those planets as human be- 
ings breathe air, and so they were 



not confined to them. They could 
move around freely in the starless 
dusk of their universe. And, if there 
was a pact, then they must be intel- 
ligent creatures — though he would 
have known that anyway, for they 
spoke to him. He could hear them 
through the tight walls of the ship 
— less in his ears than his mind — 
cajoling, entreating, promising. 
And he shut his ears and his mind, 
because he was afraid. 

At the end of the voyage, he was 
offered a permanent berth on the 
Perseus. “We don’t usually take 
crewmen from the Far Planets,” 
the second officer said thoughtfully. 
“They don’t have the training 
needed. But you’re a good deck- 
hand.” 

Len waited tensely, not know- 
ing whether he did want the job 
or not. 

“The universe is opiening up and 
sooner or later we’re going to have 
to start diversifying our crews, take 
untrained men, maybe even—” the 
officer hesitated— “extraterrestrials. 
Sometimes training can restrict a 
man to the point where he can’t 
think for himself. Main trouble 
with untrained men, though, is 
that often they’ve got too much 
imagination. They think things that 
aren’t true, see things that aren’t 
there.” 

“I understand, sir,” Mattern said. 
“I’ll keep my imagination stowed 
away until it’s wanted.” 

From then on, he had seen no

more at the ports than any of his 
properly conditioned mates. 

IV 

T EN Mattern stayed with the 
Perseus over three years. Grad- 
ually, from things he observed 
himself, from things his shipmates 
told him, he learned what little 
there was to be known about hy- 
perspace. Everything was different 
there from normspace; even the 
mechanical properties of things 
changed. However, Jumping was 
safe enough, as long as the space- 
ships didn’t stop. As long as they 
were only passing through that 
other universe, they were, in a 
sense, not actually there, so that 
the elements of whicf^ they were 
composed would not change, al- 
though, to the senses, they seemed 
to. 

Unless, of course, the ship col- 
lided with something. Then every- 
thing became very real. That was 
what the pact was for — to make 
sure they didn’t collide. Every 
spaceship had, locked in the cap- 
tain’s cabin, charts of that other 
universe — charts which gave, in 
normspace terms, the coordinates 
of the hyperspace worlds. That 
way, when a ship made the Jump, 
there would be no danger of her 
materializing inside one of the 
alien planets and destroying both. 
Even touching one of the hyper- 
worlds could have a disastrous ef- 



fect. Only the captains were ever 
permitted to see these charts; they 
would be far too dangerous in ir- 
responsible hands. 

Len might have grown old in 
the Perseus^ service, if the Hes- 
peria System hadn’t been one of 
her stops, and if he hadn’t seen 
Lyddy there. 

Hesperia was a small, rose-pink 
sun surrounded by four planets 
and the debris of what once was 
a fifth. Most solar systems in the 
Galaxy had asteroid belts like that; 
some time later, Len found out 
why. Three of Hesperia’s four 
planets were barren rocks. The 
fourth, Erytheia, was mostly water, 
calm water, sometimes blue, some- 
times — when the sun was high — 
violet-tinged. There was land, a 
small continent in the north, where 
it was always spring, a slightly 
larger continent in the south, where 
it was always summer, and that 
large island in the west which was 
said to have a climate better than 
spring and summer combined. 

The atmosphere of Erytheia was 
what they call Earth type — that 
is, Man could breathe on it. A very 
inadequate description, though, be- 
cause men could breathe the at- 
mosphere of Ziegler’s Planet, too, 
only sometimes it almost seemed 
worthwhile to stop living in order 
to stop having to breathe Ziegler’s 
air. Erytheia’s atmosphere was 
gentler and purer than the air of 
Earth. The native fruits were edi-

ble and the local life-forms were 
small and amiable. But there 
wasn’t enough land for the estab- 
lishment of a self-supporting col- 
ony; it would have bred itself into 
poverty within a few generations. 

What else could be done with a 
small paradise in a remote sector 
of space but turn it into a high- 
class brothel and gambling casino? 
Only the very rich could afford to 
travel so far to look at scenery, and 
by the time they reached their 
destination, scenery wasn’t enough. 
They wanted some excitement. 

Naturally, the Perseus would 
stop at Hesperia. Naturally, Mat- 
tern would see Lyddy, who was 
one of the seven wonders of that 
system. She wasn’t too many years 
out from Earth then, and he had 
never dreamed any woman could 
be that beautiful. 

^HE was long-necked and slen- 
der, unlike the women of the 
Far Planets, who were mostly 
squat-built and bred for labor. It 
seemed to him he had seen her 
before — in a vision, a dream, who 
knew where? Certainly never in 
reality. But he could understand 
why men would travel light-years 
for her. 

The prices she charged were 
also astronomical. Still, if he put 
away his money carefully, in a 
couple of years he ought to be able 
to save up enough for a night with 
her. It was a goal, and he’d never 



had a goal before, even such a 
small one; ever3dhing had been 
just aimless drifting. He got a tri-di 
of her and put it up inside the door 
of his locker and was happy 
dreaming of her, even if it meant 
being kidded about her by his 
shipmates. 

When he made the next Jump, 
he knew for certain that the crea- 
tures of hyperspace not only spoke 
to him through his mind, but 
could enter it and read it if they 
chose. He felt very naked and vul- 
nerable. Why couldn’t the others 
on his ship also see the creatures, 
so that he would not be the sole 
focus of their attentions? 

“Do what we ask,” the hyper- 
spacers — the xhindi, they called 
themselves — said softly, “and you 
will have enough from just a single 
voyage to have her for a week, a 
month, a year. Do what we ask 
and you can have her for all 
eternity.” 

“But all I want is just one 
night!” he protested. 

And they had laughed, and one 
with a honey-sweet mind had said, 
“Is that all you want, really all?” 
Then they began naming the 
things a man could want — and 
they certainly seemed to have a 
full knowledge of humanity and its 
most secret desires. 

Afterward, Len had started to 
think. It would be nice to have 
Lyddy all to himself — for a while, 
anyway. It would be nice to be

able to buy her pretty dresses and 
jewelry. There were other things 
that would also be nice. Maybe he 
could have his teeth fixed and his 
leg straightened. His stepfather 
had broken it the night his mother 
died and it had never set properly. 
With money, he could do a lot of 
things. He hadn’t realized there 
was so much in the universe to be 
wanted. 

Now his wages began to look as 
picayune as once they had seemed 
large. He could make more else- 
where, he told himself; he might 
not be educated, but he had a good 
mind, plus rapidly dwindling prin- 
ciples. He didn’t need the hyper- 
spacers, though. There were plenty 
of illegal ways of making money 
within the framework of norm- 
space activities. So he left the se- 
cure monotony of the starship to 
seek an enterprise which would 
bring in quick and copious profits. 

TTIS first step was to go see a 
rather disreputable acquaint- 
ance of his. Captain Ludolf Schie- 
mann. Schiemann was an ancient 
spaceman from Earth, who owned 
and commanded a ramshackle 
craft of prehistoric design, held to- 
gether with spit and spells. 

Schiemann operated out of Ca- 
pella IV with cargoes of whatever 
he could get. He was able to make 
a living with the Valkyrie only be- 
cause he would take on jobs that 
no sane skipper would touch. Some 



were dangerous; most were illegal 
into the bargain. The risks were 
out of all proportion to the profit, 
which was why the only helper 
he’d been able to get was Balas — 
a big, powerful man, not old but 
mad. He’d been a deckhand on 
one of the big starships and had 
broken too early to be entitled to 
a pension. 

Mattern had met old Schie- 
mann at a bar in Burdon, the 
capital of Capella IV, and had 
had a few drinks with him when- 
ever the Perseus and the Valkyrie 
had happened to hit port at the 
same time. Schiemann had a fa- 
vorite joke he kept repeating over 
and over: “If you ever get sick 
of the Perseus, Lennie — sick of 
good food and hot water and de- 
cent quarters — you can always 
come to the Valkyrie. I’ll take care 
of you.” 

Now Mattern went to him and 
said he’d like to take Schiemann 
up on that offer. 

The old man’s pale green eyes 
protruded even further from his 
head. “You want to leave the Per- 
seus for a berth on my ship! You’re 
madder than Balas!” 

“Not a berth. Pop,” Mattern 
told him. “A share of her — a half 
share.” 

Schiemann grinned. “Now you 
must think I’m crazy, to hand over 
half my ship just like that. Maybe 
you’d like me to sign her over to 
you entirely.” And he puffed sav- 



26 



GALAXY 



agely upon his Venuswood pipe. 

“Look,” Len said, “let’s not kid 
ourselves. You’re a crook. Pop, but 
such a lousy crook that you make 
it look as if crime really doesn’t 
pay. And I’ll tell you what’s wrong 
with the way you operate. You 
have no organization, no system, 
no imagination. I have ’em all. You 
contribute the ship; I’ll contribute 
my know-how. Together, we’ll 
make a fortune.” 

“Modest, aren’t you?’ the old 
man jeered. “What kind of know- 
how do you get working as a deck- 
hand on a starboat? All right, may- 
be you’re the universe’s best metal 
polisher, but — ” 

“Look, Pop,” Len interrupted, 
“I’ll make a deal with you. We 
work together for a year. If you 
don’t pull in at least three times 
the amount you got before, as just 
your share, my half of the ship re- 
verts to you. What could be fairer 
than that?” 

Schiemann still wasn’t con- 
vinced that he was not being 
played for a sucker. Being what 
he was, he could never expose him- 
self to a court battle, no matter 
how much justice might be on his 
side in a particular instance. But 
he didn’t think Len could be so 
rotten as to figure on something 
like that. Besides, the old captain 
couldn’t help liking the boy. So 
he agreed, saying as he did so, “I 
should have my head examined.” 
But before the fourth voyage was 



out, he realized that he had never 
done a wiser thing in his life. Un- 
der Len’s direction, the Valkyrie 
as a business enterprise was clean- 
ing up. 

Only in relative terms, of course. 
It took six months, over a dozen 
voyages, before Len managed to 
save enough for that night with 
Lyddy. And every time he made 
the Jump in the Valkyrie, the hy- 
perspacers told him, “One night 
won’t be enough,” and the honey- 
minded one had insisted, “You 
must want more than that. You 
must. Who could be satisfied with 
so little?” 

'C' INALLY, the night came. It 
was wonderful, it was ecstasy, 
it was ever3Tthing he had dreamed 
of — but it was too short. “Good- 
by, honey,” Lyddy said as he left, 
“come back and see me again.” 

“When you have some more 
money,” she meant. And it was all 
over. 

For her, not for him. He found 
he couldn’t get her out of his mind. 
One night was not enough. The 
xhindi had been right. Now he 
wanted her for his own, for the 
rest of his life if not for all eternity. 

He had no romantic fancies that 
she would be willing to go off 
with him for the sake of true love 
and himself alone. He had seen 
himself too often in the mirror 
panel on the door of his tiny cabin, 
and he looked there now, with a

27 



chill objectivity. Undersized, crip- 
pled, pallid with the unhealthy 
color that comes from spending 
too little time in any kind of sun- 
light, Len Mattern was twenty- 
four and looked forty. Not even 
an ordinary woman of the planets 
could love him, let alone a love 
goddess. 

But a love goddess who loved 
money could be bought. However, 
in order to win her, he’d need to 
have really big money. No matter 
how efficiently he organized the 
Valkyrie’s operations, the ship was 
just a battered old hulk and, in 
her sphere, could never be more 
than small-time. There was only 
one answer — hyperspace. 

He found Schiemann puffing 
contentedly at his pipe in the Val- 
kyrie’s control room. “Look, Pop,” 
he said, “we’ve been wasting our 
time on stardust. 'W'e have to aim 
for something big.” 

Schiemann looked trustfully at 
the young man. He had no rela- 
tives, so he had come to think of 
Len as his son, and, in fact, had 
made him his heir. “Whatever you 
say, Lennie. Figure on breaking 
out of this sector and moving in 
closer to Earth, do you?” 

“Not exactly. We’re going into 
hyperspace.” 

“Sure,” Schiemann said, blow- 
ing a smoke ring. “Can’t leave the 
sector without passing through hy- 
perspace; that stands to reason. 
But where are we Jumping to?” 



Len tried to keep the tautening 
of his body from becoming ap- 
parent. “We’re not Jumping any- 
where. We’re stopping in hyper- 
space.” 

The pipe dropped from the old 
man’s mouth. He caught it in his 
hand and gave a muffled exclama- 
tion as the heat burned his palm. 
Then he looked at his partner. “Of 
course you’re joking, Lennie.” And 
he arranged his face for laughter. 

Len shook his head. “No joke. 
Pop; I’m dead serious. We’re going 
to take a cargo into hyjjerspace. 
To the mem — the mem — oh, 
hell, I can’t pronounce it — the 
queen, I guess, of Ferr. That’s one 
of their planets. She wants Earth 
stuff, she says, and she promises to 
do right by us if we bring it to 
her. Sounds like a good deal.” 

1 1 'HE silence thickened as the 
-*• two' men face each other. At 
last Schiemann got up. “Look, 
Lennie, I don’t make out I’m a 
saint. I’ve smuggled and cheated 
and stolen. But this I will not do. 
For the laws of the Federation, I 
don’t give a damn — men made 
’em and men can break ’em — but 
to go against the laws of nature, 
that is a different thing.” He turned 
on his heel and went out of the 
control room. 

Len went to his cabin and began 
to pack his gear. As he had ex- 
pected, Schiemann interrupted 
him when he was halfway through. 



28 



GALAXY 



“What do you think you’re doing?” 
“Leaving,” Len said. “I’m sick 
of small-time operations.” 

“Leaving me? Just like that? 
Does our friendship mean nothing 
at all to you?” 

“Sure it does,” Len told him. 
“When I get a chance. I’ll write.” 
The old man’s face crumpled. 
“Look, Lennie, if we did move 
into one of the more important 
sectors, maybe — ” 

“You know we wouldn’t have a 
chance there,” Len said harshly, to 
conceal his true emotions. “The 
sectors closer in to Earth have 
bigger, faster ships, and bigger, 
tougher men to run ’em. And they 
wouldn’t like us trying to jet in!” 
“I’d rather take a chance on 
that than — ” 

“We wouldn’t have a chance; 
it’d just be a massacre, with us on 
the receiving end. The only way 
we can break into the big time 
ourselves is through hyperspace. 
We’ve got to do what’s never been 
done before.” 

That wasn’t quite true, from 
what the xhindi had told him, but 
near enough. It had been done be- 
fore, but not very often, and not 
very recently. However, it had 
been done, so it was possible to do. 
Otherwise he wouldn’t think of 
chancing it ... or would he? 

“Why do you want money so 
much, Lennie?” Schiemann asked. 
“What do we need the big-time 
stuff for? It’s nice and quiet and 



practically secure the way you’ve 
got things running for us, almost 
like we were honest businessmen. 
So why go looking for trouble?” 

“If I’d wanted a quiet life,” Len 
said, “I’d have stuck with the 
Perseus. So don’t sing me security.” 
The hand that held the pipe was 
trembling. “Look, Lennie, at least 
give me time to think.” 

“Okay,” Len said. He was, in 
his way, fond of the old man, but 
there were bigger things at stake. 
He had to have Lyddy; he had to 
have money; he had to have . 
something he couldn’t put a name 
to, but desperately important none- 
theless. “I’ll give you six months.” 

A T the end of half a year, Schie. 
mann said no, he positively 
wouldn’t do it. Len said “Good-by.” 
Schiemann said, “All right, but 
you’ll be sorry; we’ll all be sorry,” 
and gave in. 

So they took the Valkyrie, the 
two of them — and Balas, of course, 
but naturally nobody would con- 
sult a madman — and headed for 
hyperspace. Len knew exactly 
where to go, even though he had 
no charts. The breakthrough he 
wanted was in their own sector and 
it had been carefully marked for 
him in his mind. 

Schiemann left all the details to 
him, even the selection of cargo. 
Len chose coal. He knew that what 
the xhindi wanted was normspace 
materials, but not precisely what 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



29 



materials. Their normspace value 
did not matter, because norm- 
space matter changed to another 
form of itself when it got to hyper- 
space, and that was where the pos- 
sibility of enormous profit came in. 
Something cheap in normspace 
could become something quite rare 
and expensive in hyperspace, and 
vice versa. The distribution of ele- 
ments was different between the 
two universes; each one essentially 
complemented the other. 

There was one hitch: a stable 
form in normspace could become 
an unstable one in hyperspace. 
Without empiric knowledge, it was 
impossible for anyone going from 
one universe into the other to tell 
whether any substance he was 
carrying or wearing or was would 
remain stable. If unstable, it could 
turn into liquid or gas; it could 
turn into energy and blow up; it 
could cease to be a solid in any 
one of a number of ways. 

As if that weren’t bad enough, 
it could also happen that even a 
stuff previously proven to be sta- 
ble in both universes could become 
unstable, if there was even the 
trace of a potentially unstable ele- 
ment, or if something that, stable 
in itself, combined with it in un- 
stable fashion. Such an admixture 
could be accidental, which was 
what made the whole business es- 
pecially tricky, and what made the 
reason for the inter-universe ban 
necessary. 



The reason why that first load 
of the Valkyrie’s had been coal 
was a simple one. Somewhere, Len 
had read that coal and diamonds 
were different forms of the same 
normspace element, and he’d 
thought that might carry over into 
the other continuum. However, 
even an education wouldn’t have 
helped him know what a right 
first cargo to take would have 
been. The xhindi had told him 
what they did know, but their 
terminology was not clear. They 
spoke his language with outward 
correctness but with imjjerfect con- 
ceptualization; he spoke theirs not 
at all. Much of what they did 
know, they appeared to have for- 
gotten, or only half-learned. 

They managed to make him un- 
derstand that certain stuffs would 
be definitely unsafe; they could 
not make it clear which stuffs 
would be safe, or which they would 
find most desirable as trade goods. 
He gathered that they would be 
satisfied with anjrthing that come 
through. So he chose coal, hoping 
to make a splendid initial im- 
pression. 

* I '’HE Valkyrie reached hyper- 
space. It slowed down. The 
throbbing of its creaky engines 
ebbed to a hum. And it stopped 
and hung there in the quiet dark- 
ness of utterly alien time and 
place. Schiemann and Balas, ex- 
pectedly, changed their appear- 



30 



GALAXY 



ance, but he had seen them in 
their monster guises before. The 
coal changed to something pale 
and glittering, but not diamonds. 
Everything remained quiet. The 
ship’s instruments recorded no 
temperature change, but it seemed 
to grow colder and colder inside 
her. 

Suddenly, Mattern knew the 
truth. A trap had been laid for 
him, and he had tumbled neatly 
into it And the most shameful 
part was that his own desires and 
yearnings — deliberately fostered 
by the xhindi — had been the bait. 

He wanted to turn to the horri- 
ble thing that Schiemann' had be- 
come to scream, “Let’s go back!” 
But he couldn’t. Something held 
tight grip of his mind. And, look- 
ing out the portholes, he saw that 
the xhindi had begun to swarm. 

The flickering terror of their ap- 
pearance became more awesome 
to him than it had been at the 
beginning, when he’d been only a 
transitory shadow in hyi>erspace. 
Now. although he had no doubt 
th-i' they were friendly — indeed, 
almost ardent in their welcoming 
— horror chilled him all over 
again. He could almost feel the 
molecules inside his body slow 
down as his viscera quivered 
faintly and then froze into still- 
ness. 

He looked at Schiemann and 
Balas. Neither of them could, he 
knew, see the hyperspacers. Their 



conditioning back on Eiarth’s space 
schools had ensured this. That was 
the real reason for the schools; any 
actual training was incidental. But 
Schiemann knew the creatures 
were there, and so he could sense 
them. And Balas, too, certainly 
seemed to sense something as he 
stood there, tense and wary and 
almost understanding. It must be 
even worse, Len thought, to know 
the hyperspacers were out there 
and not be able to see them. 

“We — we can still go back,” 
Schiemann said in a cracked voice; 
apparently the minds outside had 
not touched his. “Please, Len- 
nie . .” 

“No, it’s too late!” Mattern 
cried. Once he went back, he 
would never dare return, and all 
hope of — Lyddy would fade into 
fog. The thought of not being able 
to have her was unbearable. “We 
can’t go back now!” 

The hideous mask that was 
Schiemann’s hyperspace visage 
contorted, and drops of liquid 
flowed where his withered cheeks 
would have been in normspace. 
“Please, Lennie. .” 

“I can’t,” Len said. “Even if I 
wanted to, I couldn’t. It’s too late, 
now that we’ve stopped.” 

He forced out the words, against 
objections that seemed to come 
from outside him — not objections 
to Schiemann’s knowing the truth, 
but to his own admission of it. 
“They’re in control,” he said. 

31 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



V 

f?T¥7E bid you welcome to our 
** universe, Mattern,” the 
xhindi said in his mind. “Come, 
follow us. We will lead you to the 
port on Ferr that we have made 
ready for you.” 

“Will the ship be safe there?” 
Mattern asked, remembering the 
further danger of touching alien 
substance. 

“As safe as she could be any- 
where in this space.” And then the 
mellifluous one added, “Remem- 
ber, whatever risks there are, now 
we share them with you.” 

A point of livid light that danced 
so Mattern knew it must be alive 
led them to the gleaming purple- 
dark ovoid that was Ferr, then to 
the place that had been set aside 
for the Valkyrie. The xhindi had 
been right about the port so far 
as the ship herself was concerned. 
Probably they’d had a fair idea of 
what materials she and her con- 
tents were comjxised of from the 
ships that had passed fleetingly 
through their space, never pausing 
to become real. What they could 
not allow for were the random fac- 
tors. 

The ship set down on the “safe” 
port at Ferr. It made contact with 
the glossy alien ground. And, as 
it did so. Captain Schiemann very 
quietly disintegrated. No explo- 
sion, no sound. He simply crum- 
bled into a white powder which 



slowly drifted away, and then was 
gone. 

“Coal into diamonds,” Mattern 
found himself saying as he stared 
at Schiemann’s pipe rolling on the 
empty corridor floor, “dust unto 
dust.” When the pipe quivered to 
a stop, he began to laugh hysteri- 
cally. 

“So you think it’s funny, do 
you?” a gentle voice said behind 
him. 

Mattern turned. Balas stood 
there. 

“I’m afraid that I don’t agree,” 
Balas went on with that frighten- 
ing softness. “He was good to me, 
and to you too, Lennie. He was 
damned good to the both of us. 
And this is the way you repay 
him. It wasn’t a nice thing to do, 
Lennie.” 

Mattern opened his mouth to 
deny intent, but all that came out 
was the bubbling laughter. 

“I know you didn’t mean for 
him to disappear like that,” Balas 
said, almost kindly. “It’s just that 
I guess you don’t care what hap- 
pens to anybody but yourself. No, 
you don’t care for yourself even, 
just the things you want. You’re 
awful greedy, Lennie ~ awful 
greedy.” 

His voice was very reasonable. 
“If I don’t do something to stop 
you, you’ll do the same thing to 
our whole universe that you did 
to the captain. It would be wrong 
for me to let that happen. So, you 



32 



GALAXY 



see, I have to kill you. I’m sorry, 
Lennie, because I like you, but I 
know you’ll understand.” 

And he lunged for Mattern, 
reaching out the four monstrous 
arms that were his in hyperspace, 
the eye in his forehead brilliant 
with that hideous sanity. 

Mattern backed away, still 
laughing. It Balas has gone sane, 
he thought, then perhaps / have 
gone mad. Only I am still con- 
scious of everything that’s going 
on: the danger I am in, the way I 
am behaving. In fact, I have con- 
trol over all of myself except my 
laughter. I know where we are — 
Balas and I are locked inside the 
ship alone together, and only one 
of us is coming out alive. 

TTNDOUBTEDLY the xhindi 
^ could have passed through 
the hull or opened the airlocks in 
some way, if they had wanted to. 
But they made no move to try, 
merely remained outside, watch- 
ing. The two humans, in that 
space and time, were alone in a 
small private war of their own. 
Mattern could not tell whether 
the xhindi outside were enjoying 
themselves, as a group of humans 
would have under like circum- 
stances, but he seemed to sense 
anxiety for the outcome — not only 
of that battle but of another, inner 
one. Why, I’m beginning to read 
their thoughts, too, he realized, in 
the middle of his fear and hysteria. 



I am growing closer to them by 
the minute. 

And Balas was getting closer to 
him. Mattern had a blaster, of 
course, but he was afraid to use 
it. A bolt of alien energy might 
produce a reaction that could rip 
both universes. Yet, bare-handed, 
he was no match for the bigger, 
stronger man. Fortunately, he had 
never pretended to be a hero, not 
even to himself in the saneness of 
normspace, so he was able to turn 
and run. Balas pursued him 
through the desolate corridors of 
the Valkyrie, Mattern’s laughter 
echoing crazily in the emptiness. 

His only hope was to find a 
hand weapon — or something that 
could be used as a hand weapon. 
And, as he rounded a bend, Mat- 
tern saw the primitive fire axe 
hanging against a bulkhead, the 
traditional relic that all spaceships, 
large and small, carried and kept 
burnished and ready for a use that 
would never come. But there was 
another use it could be put to. 

Instinct made Mattern seize the 
axe from its hooks on the wall. 
Instinct surged up from the handle 
to fill him with the power and joy 
and knowledge to use it. He turned 
to face Balas’ onrush, and his laugh- 
ter no longer sounded insane in 
his ears; it had the triumphant 
energy of a primeval war cry. 

The madman’s charge was light- 
ning fast, but Mattern was the 
younger man by at least a decade. 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



33 



He told himself that he meant 
only to stun Balas, but he was con- 
scious all the time that, if Balas 
were merely stunned, the problem 
would be merely postponed. He 
lifted the axe and brought it down. 
And then Mattern was alone, the 
only human being in an alien 
space and an alien time, locked 
in this ship with the drifting white 
dust that had been his friend, and 
the bleeding corpse that had been 
— no, not his enemy, but his friend 
also, and who had, only minutes 
after death, already begun to 
haunt him. It was then that Mat- 
tern remembered the other man 
he had killed in the same way. 

Karl Brodek had never haunted 
him, but that was because Len 
knew the killing was justified — it 
was retribution, not murder. For 
Len had seen Brodek kill his 
mother, not all at once, but little 
by little. It was her face that 
stayed with him always, her blue 
eyes and her sweet voice. She’d 
been the only one he ever had, 
really — the brother had been 
nothing but a wailing blob of pro- 
toplasm — and then Schiemann, 
a little. Now he was more alone 
than he’d been in all of his solitary 
life. 

He knew that the eerie crea- 
tures outside meant him no harm, 
but would have liked to comfort 
him if they could. That made it 
worse rather than better. If only 
there were some tangible enemy 



to attack, to beat his fists against 
. but the only enemy he could 
find was the monstrous form re- 
flected in the mirror of his own 
cabin. 

He was no longer laughing, he 
noticed; the fit was over. And so, 
he sensed, was the anxiety outside. 
In some way, he had passed a test. 

TT was then that the xhindi be- 
-*• gan to speak to him through 
the hull of the ship, urging him to 
come out. “You have come so far,” 
they said, “and time is a precious 
and a dangerous commodity. We 
cannot afford to waste it, either 
of us.” 

He did not— could not— respond. 

They could have forced him 
out, but they were kind — or per- 
haps only wise. They simply 
coaxed and waited. After a while, 
moving stiffly, as if he had cogs in- 
stead of a heart, he opened the 
airlock and went outside. He set 
foot on the dark polished surface 
of Ferr. But there was no thrill of 
strangeness or of triumph or anti- 
cipation. There was . nothing. 
His physical senses were all oper- 
ating. He knew there was neither 
gravity nor lack of it. He knew 
there was no atmosphere — and he 
accepted that, not because he ac- 
cepted the xhindi’s word that he 
would not need to breathe in this 
continuum, but because he didn’t 
care whether or not he breathed; 
he didn’t care about anything.

“Come,” the xhindi said, in aud- 
ible words now, and their spoken 
voices were as sweet as their mind 
voices. 

He found himself moving as 
through a nightmare, as he pro- 
ceeded according to their direct- 
ions, and the xhindi themselves, 
with their monstrous grace and 
musical voices, were a logical part 
of the black ballet in which he 
found himself participating. 

The dignitaries of Ferr, a fan- 
tasy procession in the moonlit 
colors of hell — smoke and flame 
and shadow — came to greet him 
and to lead him to the mbretersha. 
She glittered splendidly upon her 
throne of alien substance — a mon- 
ster, of course, in human terms, 
and yet also a great lady, as a 
queen should be in any terms. 
Through the fog of his own im- 
mediate perception, she reached 
out and touched him with her dig- 
nity and compassion. 

“I am very sorry,” she said, “that 
such a thing should have hap- 
pened. I know you are full of grief 
for your comrades, and I wish that 
I could have p>ostponed our inter- 
view. However, I must press you, 
for the longer you stay on this 
world, the greater the risk is for 
my people.” 

Somewhere before, it seemed to 
him, he had heard her voice — 
sensed her mind pattern, anyway. 
If he had not known that she was 
the mbretersha, he would have 

36 



fancied that hers had been one of 
the minds that had spoken to him, 
the most persuasive of the cajoling 
creatures that had sung him their 
siren songs as he flashed transistor- 
ily through their universe. But, he 
thought dully, that was impossible. 
She was the mbretersha, the queen. 

She read his thoughts, and the 
pattern of her appearance altered 
subtly. It was a warm and kind 
expression of herself; it was a 
smile. “You must learn, Mattern, 
that the concept of a ruler in this 
universe differs from the concept 
in yours. Here a ruler is the ser- 
vant of her people, not their mas- 
ter. It is her obligation to take 
care of them, protect them, watch 
over them — in whatever way 
seems most fitting to her. She can 
have no pride in herself, only in 
them. They are more than her 
children.” 

TT was funny, Mattern thought, 
that she should so easily plan 
to break the rules of her universe. 
A space rat like him — that was 
one thing; it was to be expected. 
But a queen? Now that he was 
coming back to life a little, he be- 
gan to wonder about this again. 

Deftly, she picked the wonder 
out of his mind and answered it. 
“Our Federation, like yours, is an 
artificial creation. Its laws are no 
more than arbitrary regulations, 
devised by the various peoples of 
each universe with regard to the 



GALAXY 



greatest good of the majority, and 
thrust upon majority and minority 
alike.” 

Mattern began to understand, or 
thought he did. “A queen isn’t like- 
ly to hold with democracy,” he 
said — though perhaps not aloud. 

She was a little impatient. “It’s 
not a question of absolute p>ower or 
divine right — simply that my 
people come first, even before my- 
self; my own world is part of me, 
and I am part of it by nature and 
instinct. Its needs are my needs. 
When my people are hungry, I 
feel the pangs.” 

Most rulers justify themselves 
like that, he thought, keeping his 
lips pressed firmly together. But 
they all do the same things. 

But he couldn’t keep her out 
of his mind. “No,” she said, “you’re 
wrong. I was not speaking meta- 
phorically. My nervous system is 
attuned to my people’s; it is a 
hereditary trait bred into my fam- 
ily. So being the ruler is not a 
pleasant station to occupy.” 

It certainly wouldn’t be, he 
thought, if she was telling the 
truth — to suffer every pang that 
was suffered on the planet, and, if 
the attuning were psychic also, 
every sorrow. He expected her to 
pick the disbelief out of his mind, 
but she smiled and went on to tell 
him about her planet. 

Ferr was not a large world. 
Moreover, it was essentially a bar- 
ren one. It had been rich only 



because it had previously engaged 
in sub-rosa commerce with Mat- 
tern’s universe. “And the last traf- 
fic was long, long ago,” she told 
Mattern. “In a day much before 
mine, when my mother ruled.” 

“What happened? What stopped 
the traffic?” 

“Our captain died of old age, 
and we have had trouble finding a 
successor to him.” 

“Why is it so hard to get some- 
body else?” Mattern asked blunt- 
ly- 

She paused. When she spoke 
again, it was so obliquely that he 
did not realize immediately that it 
was an answer. “Time was when 
we had more contact with your 
people. There were many who 
knew of the xhindi, although few 
had actually encountered us. It 
was not difficult for us to get hu- 
mans to work with us then. But 
the barbarians took over your 
world and your people lost the 
knowledge of how to get through 
to us. And when they regained it, 
we were not why they wished to 
get through. Much of the problem 
is in making people believe that 
we exist.” 

He nodded. “The ffluska call 
you demons.” 

“There are still some on Earth 
who call us demons, Mattern. Your 
rulers and administrators do not 
call us demons — no, they are too 
learned for that — but your Space 
Service, by means of divers spells 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



37 



and conditionings, prevents most 
of those who pass through hyper- 
space from seeing and hearing us. 
And, of those who do, most are 
too frightened for negotiation.” 

S HE asked with sorrowful arch- 
ness, “Are we so terrible in your 
eyes, Mattern?” 

“I don’t know,” he said slowly, 
bewilderedly. “Sometimes you are, 
and I know you will be again. 
But right now, to me you look — 
almost beautiful.” 

There was silence, and, for a 
moment, he thought that he had 
offended her. 

Then, “Thank you,” she said 
softly. “It is a great compliment.” 
He was anxious to know why 
they had chosen him as their hu- 
man representative. “Weren’t there 
any men who did try to get 
through?” he asked. 

“A few — a very few — reached 
this space.” She added reluctantly, 
“Some of them proved to lack 
stability of substance—” 

He was angry, at her, and at 
himself, for not realizing that he 
had not been chosen. It had mere- 
ly been a question of survival. 
“Then you knew what could hap- 
pen to Schiemann!” 

“It could have happend to any- 
one, Mattern. You knew there 
were risks to be taken. We did not 
conceal that from you.” 

And that was true. It had not 
occurred to him that the risks 



would not be equally shared by 
all three members of the ship’s 
company. 

The mbretersha continued : 
“And others of those who come 
through go mad. We feared that 
might happen to you, Mattern.” 
“Others go sane also,” he said. 
“This is the first time that has 
happened in my experience. But 
truly, Mattern, a madman would 
not seek to reach us.” 

“I wonder,” Mattern said. “I 
wonder if anybody but a madman 
would.” 

This time he had displeased her. 
There was chill silence, and then: 
“Time is short. It is best that we 
return to discussing our business 
together. Now we will pay you for 
the merchandise you have brought 
us with a substance which is stable 
on Earth — at least it was in times 
gone by — and which used to be- 
come a stuff of considerable value. 
On your next trip—” 

“What makes you think there’s 
going to be a next trip? What 
makes you think I’m going to come 
back here again?” He would really 
have to be a madman to go 
through that all over again. 

The mbretersha smiled. “You 
will come, Mattern,” she said. 
“You will come when you see how 
rewarding it is to deal with us. And 
you will come because—” 

“Because of what?” he de- 
manded, more sharply than one 
should address a queen. 



38 



GALAXY 



“Because your kqyres will make 
sure that you do.” The tall, splen- 
didly illuminated being who stood 
close to her throne bowed as she 
introduced him : “This is Lord 
Njeri, who served as kqyres with 
the previous captain. He will serve 
with you.” 

“Kqyres? What’s that?” Appre- 
hension quickened inside Mattern. 
“And what right have you to—” 

“Your partner is dead,” the 
mretersha told him. “Lord Njeri 
is your new partner.” 

1%/|’ ATTERN stood staring at 
her. No point protesting fur- 
ther, he knew; he was on her world, 
in her power. For the time being, 
he would have to obey her. 

“Come, Captain Mattern,” said 
the kqyres. “It is fitting that we 
superintend the loading of the 
ship.” 

So they went back to the port 
and Mattern watched the xhindi 
fill the Valkyrie’s hold with some 
queer, spongy-looking substance 
that couldn’t possibly be of value 
anywhere. And beside him stood 
the kqyres, as he was to be be- 
side him for the next fifteen years. 

“If you are disturbed about my 
effect upon your people when they 
catch sight of me,” the kqyres as- 
sured the young man, “you may 
ease your mind. I shall make my- 
self so that I am barely visible in 
your universe. Only those who 
look for me can see me. You need 



have no fear,” he added with a 
sigh. “I have been through all this 
before.” 

“Yeah, that’s what she told me,” 
said Mattern grimly. 

“It is disloyal of me, I know,” 
the xhind murmured, “but I had 
hoped the mbretersha would not 
find a human representative be- 
fore I died. I am aware of my 
obligation to my world — but it is 
not a pleasant prospect to spend 
one’s last years in exile, however 
honorable.” 

“Don’t worry, as soon as we get 
to normspace. I’ll send you back. 
I’m not going on with this.” 

The kqyres seemed to shrug 
sadly. “You cannot send me back, 
for I am permanently attached to 
you. Wherever you go, I go — 
until the mbretersha chooses to 
free us, one from the other.” 

Mattern couldn’t believe that. 
Once he got out of this alien uni- 
verse, none of its laws could ap- 
ply to him. 

“Secondly,” the kqyres informed 
him, “you will want to come back 
here. When you look at the cargo 
and see what it is, you will want 
to come back.” He sighed again. 
“I know your species so well. And 
I do not fancy they have changed.” 

VI 

V|^HEN the Valkyrie reached 
” normspace, her cargo proved 
to be the traditional reward— gold. 

39 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



Not the most precious metal in 
the universe any more, certainly, 
but still valuable. What there was 
in her hold would come to p>er- 
haps as much money as Mattern 
might, if his luck had held, have 
amassed in several decades of 
operating with Schiemann in norm- 
spaCe. 

“Well,” said the kqyres as Mat- 
tern stood goggling at the glow- 
ing bullion, “is the payment just?” 

“Yeah,” Mattern grunted, “fair 
enough.” His mind was working 
busily: Captain Schiemann is 

dead, and so is Balas, so I can’t 
do anything about that. A man’s 
got to have some kind of busi- 
ness. Why shouldn’t I go on trad- 
ing with the xhindi, since I seem 
to be one of the few people lucky 
enough to be able to do it? Be- 
sides, from what the mbretersha 
said, I couldn’t get out of it even 
if I wanted to. So why fight? 
Ethics aside, it’s a good deal. I’d 
make more money that way than 
any other way. I could see a lot 
of Lyddy. 

He caught a flicker in the shift- 
ing planes of a grayness that the 
kqyres had become, according to 
promise. 

“I’m thinking the way you want 
me to think — right, Lord Njeri?” 
Mattern asked self-mockingly. 

“You are thinking the way any 
reasonable being would think.” 

Left to his own devices, Mat- 
tern would have disposed of the 

40 



gold as quickly as he could, and 
then gone back to Erytheia to 
spend it all on a year or so with 
Lyddy. She came that expensive. 

“And then what would you 
do?” the kqyres queried. 

“Well, then I’d go out to hyper- 
space and make more, I guess. 
I know it’s a little tough on you,” 
Mattern added aF>ologetically, “but 
you know how it is; I’m crazy 
about that woman.” 

The kqyres evidently did not 
know, but he made an effort to 
understand. “And, meanwhile, she 
will go back to — doing what she 
has been doing, with other men?” 
Mattern frowned. “Yeah, I guess 

«« »» 

SO. 

“This procedure is acceptable 
in terms of your culture?” 

“Well,” Mattern said, “for wom- 
en like Lyddy, sure. I mean — oh, 
hell — it’s hard to explain.” 

“But it doesn’t disturb you?” 
“All right,” Mattern said sullen- 
ly, “so it disturbs me. So what can 
I do about it?” 

“Would it not be wiser,” the 
kqyres suggested, “for you to wait 
until you can get enough money 
so you can have her for yourself 
alone? After all, how long would 
it take for you to get together a 
sufficient sum at that rate?” And 
the kqyres indicated the gold. 

“You got a point there.” Mat- 
tern could see that the xhind was 
right. It would be a lot more sen- 
sible to make a few more trips and 



GALAXY 



get himself a sizable bankroll be- 
fore going after Lyddy, so he’d 
never have to share her again. 
Otherwise it would be back and 
forth, back and forth, until it sent 
him off his mental course. 

S O, as soon as he disposed of the 
gold, he went back with an- 
other cargo, and then another. 
Waiting for Lyddy wasn’t as bad 
as he thought it would be, be- 
cause he could talk to the kqyres 
about her. He’d never had some- 
body he could really talk to; even 
Captain Schiemann hadn’t really 
been a companion. The kqyres al- 
ways seemed interested in what 
Mattern had to say. He never 
talked much about himself, but he 
listened patiently to Mattern’s de- 
scription of Lyddy’s talents, and 
charms, including some which, as 
a non-human, he could understand 
only intellectually, if at all. 

And he didn’t only listen, with it 
going in one ear and out the other 
— or whatever the xhindi had in- 
stead of ears. He made helpful 
suggestions, such as maybe Mat- 
tern ought to fix himself up a lit- 
tle before going back for Lyddy. 

“I know she is to be — bought,” 
he said, as if he still didn’t quite 
understand what that meant, “but 
would you not derive greater 
pleasure from your purchase if you 
knew you were a man whom a 
woman could like for his own 
self?” 



Len was silent. He knew the 
kqyres couldn’t understand human 
concepts of beauty; he had taken 
Len’s own word that the young 
man wasn’t much of a specimen, 
that his body and his teeth were 
crooked and his skin bad, his 
vision defective and his hair drab. 
Lyddy deserved something bet- 
ter than that; Len knew it himself. 
Even if she would go with him 
for the sake of the money, it 
wasn’t the same thing. 

“I could get my teeth fixed up 
in this sector,” he said at last, “but 
I’d need to go to the Near Planets, 
maybe even Earth, to have my leg 
fixed. It’d take a long time and 
passage costs a hell of a lot. Peo- 
ple don’t go that far just for a 
junket, you know. For most of ’em, 
it’s a once-in-a-lifetime deal.” 

“Of course,” Njeri said. “Your 
wealth is dearly won; you wouldn’t 
want to squander it. However, 
wouldn’t a considerable economy 
be effected if you went in your 
own ship?” 

“The Valkyrie!” Len was shocked 
into laughter. “She’d never make 
it to Earth! She’d crumple up like 
an old paper bag!” 

“She will not last much longer, 
in any case,” said Njeri. 

Len had been thinking that him- 
self for some time — wondering 
how soon he would have no ship 
left at all, and what he would do 
then. 

“It would be wise,” the kqyres 

41 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



suggested, “for you first to get 
enough money to pay for a new 
ship. Only a few more trips should 
be necessary. Then go to whatever 
planet you deem most suitable for 
the necessary improvements, and 
finally return to Lyddy — a man 
worthy not only of her but of any 
woman.” 

“It’ll take so long,” Mattern 
said, tempted, and yet driven wild 
by the idea of Lyddy, so close to 
attainment. 

“At your age, what are a few 
more trips?” 

Len gave in. 

A CTUALLY, it took five trips 
into hyperspace merely to 
pay for the new vessel, a much 
larger and more elaborate model 
than Len had planned on buying. 
“In the long run,” his partner told 
him, “the best is most economical. 
A sound, spaceworthy vessel such 
as this one will last out your life- 
time. And you can call her the 
Hesperian Queen, after Lyddy.” 
“Why?” Len asked. “Is that 
what Lyddy is short for?” 

“It is the same as naming it 
after her,” the kqyres said shortly. 
“Only it’s a little more subtle.” 
“Oh.” Somehow the kqyres 
made Len feel stupid, uncouth al- 
most, even though he was the hu- 
man being and the other nothing 
but hyperextraterrestrial. 

The treatments were even cost- 
lier than anticipated, and it took 

42 



many more trips to pay for them. 
Expenses were increased by the 
fact that he had to commute back 
and forth from his sector of space 
to the planet where he was being 
treated, since he couldn’t afford to 
neglect his business now that his 
costs were mounting. 

He had his leg straightened on 
Earth. That world was as colorful, 
as complex, as intoxicating as it 
was claimed to be. One series of 
marvels after another presented 
themselves before his inexperi- 
enced eyes like scenes in a vision 
show — except that he was actual- 
ly there, breathing, tasting, feeling 
a part of this vast sophistication. 
Earth had many beautiful women, 
and he enjoyed the favors of those 
in Lyddy’s profession, but only to 
prove to himself that she was 
much more wonderful. 

He decided there was no point 
bothering with the other planets; 
he might as well have his teeth 
and everything else taken care of 
on Earth, too. “Very wise of you,” 
the kqyres approved. “The best is 
always the soundest, and, hence, 
most worth waiting for. Like 
Lyddy.” 

“Yes,” Mattern agreed, “she is 
the best. And the most beautiful.” 

“Of course,” the kqyres said. 
“Tell me more about her.” 

And Mattern talked, far into 
the night. What he couldn’t remem- 
ber of her by now, he imagined, 
so that the picture should be com- 



G A LAXY 



plete, not only for the xhind but 
for himself. 

When his leg and his teeth had 
been fixed, “Why stop at that?” 
the kqyres asked. “If it had not 
been for the way that stepfather 
of yours treated you as a child—” 
for Len had found himself telling 
his companion not only about Lyd- 
dy but about everything — “you 
would be a fine-looking man to- 
day. It would be no difficult task 
to have you restored to what you 
should rightfully be.” 

IVT ATTERN would not, of 
course, do such a thing out 
of vanity. But the more present- 
able he made himself, the more he 
would be offering Lyddy. So it 
would be worth the extra time, 
especially since he could spend 
so much of it on E^rth. Lyddy had 
come from Earth; it would be a 
bond between them later. 

Doctors and cosmetologists got 
to work on him. Each treatment 
seemed to be lengthier than the 
preceding one, and more expen- 
sive. He could, however, easily af- 
ford it — all he had to do was 
make more trips. The kqyres not 
only told him what cargoes to take 
but advised him on the invest- 
ments to make with his profits. 

They did very well together. As 
far as Mattern was concerned, 
they did fabulously well, because 
he had to make enough on his 
side to counterbalance the entire 



expenses of a planet on the other. 
The thought impressed him. I am, 
in a sense, equal to the mbretersha, 
he thought, and she is a monarch. 
As a result, he walked a little more 
erect than even the operations had 
rendered him. 

The dangers of his trade grew 
less and less frightening as he 
came to know his way between 
the universes, even though, at the 
same time, he began to realize 
how great those dangers were. He 
had not conceived of their im- 
mensity before. The reason there 
were asteroid belts in so many of 
the solar systems, he learned now, 
was that the xhindi had traded 
with other intelligent races in ear- 
lier eras, and there had been ac- 
cidents. Those races were now ex- 
tinct. 

The xhindi themselves ceased 
to be monstrous in his eyes. He 
grew to accept their appearance as 
perfectly natural in their universe. 
Toward the kqyres, he came to 
feel something of what he had felt 
toward Schiemann, except that 
where Schiemann had looked up 
to him and relied on him, he 
found himself increasingly depen- 
dent on Njeri. He told him all 
his hopes and ambitions, and the 
kqyres listened attentively. Mat- 
tern tried to explain to him how 
he himself felt about Lyddy, and 
the kqyres tried to understand. 

The kqyres taught Mattern how 
to play chess. “But that’s our 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



43 



game!” Mattern said. “I mean we 
play it in our universe!” 

“In ours also,” the xhind smiled. 
“Who knows whether it came from 
our universe to yours, or yours to 
ours? Nor does it matter. It is an 
old game and a good one.” 

Mattern became increasingly 
skillful at it. He was pleased that 
there was an intellectual activity 
in which he could engage as an 
equal with the kqyres, and the 
kqyres seemed pleased, too. 

'^n^HEN the treatments were 
** over, Mattern looked in a 
mirror. He was straight; he was 
handsome. His skin was clear, his 
eyes bright. He looked less than 
his age. Now he could go back to 
Lyddy, assured that most women 
would find his physical appear- 
ance more than acceptable. 

But he found himself hesitat- 
ing. Only his physical appearance 
would be truly acceptable. There 
was something still lacking in him. 
His body was right, but the way 
he stood, the way he moved, the 
way he spoke, all these were 
wrong. 

“I’m not finished yet,” he said 
stumblingly to the kqyres, “not 
quite straightened out. I ought to 
be more — well, more smooth.” 
“You do lack polish,” the kqyres 
admitted, “although you are far 
less awkward, shall we say, than 
when we first met.” 

“That’s because of you, Njeri!” 



Mattern declared, with genuine 
gratitude. “You’ve taught me a 
lot!” And he looked at his out- 
landish friend with a great affec- 
tion. 

The kqyres seemed quite 
moved; he flickered like a pin- 
wheel. “You have been an exceed- 
ingly apt pupil, Mattern. When 
first I saw you, I did not think 
it possible that I should ever con- 
sider you a companion. However, 
I have found myself taking an in- 
creasing pleasure in your com- 
pany. Sometimes I even forget 
you are a human.” 

Mattern could not speak; he 
was so overwhelmed by the tribute. 

“The passage of time disclosed 
to me that there were sensitivi- 
ties and perceptions beneath that 
— forgive me, but we know how 
misleading first impressions can 
be — boorish exterior. The very 
fact that you are conscious of your 
own deficiencies proves that you 
are more than the mere clod you 
still, on occasion, seem to be—” 
“Can’t I improve myself that 
way, too?” Mattern asked plain- 
tively. “Can’t I make myself 
worthy of Lyddy in every way?” 
“Of course you can,” the kqyres 
beamed. “Were you to apply 
yourself specifically to the acquisi- 
tion of culture, I am sure you 
could become as polished as any 
human being can hope to be. But 
it will take time.” 

“Well,” Mattern said, “Lyddy’s 

GALAXY 



44 



waited so long, she can wait a little 
longer. Things worth having are 
worth waiting for.” 

Under Njeri’s tutelage, Mattern 
cultivated the arts and the ameni- 
ties. As he used his ship for a per- 
manent residence, it was there that 
he housed his growing collection 
of costly rare objects of art, and 
his library, notable for its first edi- 
tions — not only of tapes, but of 
books. His uniforms were cut by 
the best terrestrial tailors and he 
took kinescope courses in the lib- 
eral arts and social forms from the 
outstanding universities of Earth. 
The provincial twang vanished 
from his speech; he developed a 
taste for wine and conversation. 
Nobody, seeing him, could ever 
have fancied him once a poor wiz- 
ened space rat. 

A S the years went by, he grew 
to become as much of a ruler 
in his way as the mbretersha in 
hers. She ruled one planet, he told 
himself, but he had a business em- 
pire farflung over many planets — 
all of which, to some extent, he 
did rule through his investments. 
He would have worlds to lay at 
Lyddy’s feet now, he thought com- 
placently. No man could offer any 
woman more. 

The first Hesperian Queen didn’t 
have a chance to last out his life- 
time; he kept trading her in for 
another and yet another model, 
as better, faster, more luxurious 



starships were developed. Finally, 
he outbid the Federation Govern- 
ment itself for plans of the latest- 
model spacecraft. When the gov- 
ernment protested, he graciously 
gave them copies free of all charge. 
“I merely wanted to be sure that 
I had the best ship available,” he 
explained. “I have no objection to 
your having it also. But I knew 
that you could not afford to be as 
generous as I can.” 

He never had more than one 
ship, because it was too dangerous 
to run more than one cargo at a 
time. His crew was always as 
small in number as possible. He 
would have preferred none at all; 
actually, all spaceships could run 
themselves, for the controls were 
completely automatic. But regu- 
lations said there had to be a 
crew, both for the sake of “face” 
— many extraterrestrials couldn’t 
seem to recognize the authority 
of machines — and because a pow- 
er failure was not inconceivable. 

So the Hesperian Queen carried 
four men. And, whenever she 
made the Jump through hyper- 
space, even the crew — though 
conditioned on Earth — was 
drugged. Mattern carried on alone. 
And if, when the crewmen awak- 
ened, they found that a day had 
passed when only an hour should 
have gone by, they knew better 
than to ask questions. 

So the years went by — busy, 
pleasant, profitable years. The 

45 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



image of Lyddy was always before 
him, inspiring him to further ef- 
forts. Someday soon I will go back 
to her, he would tell himself. On 
his latest birthday, he looked in 
the mirror closely. At twenty-four, 
he had appeared forty; at forty, 
he could have passed for thirty. 
Sixteen years had gone by since 
that night with Lyddy. Now he 
was worthy of her or anyone. 

“I think it’s time I went back 
for her,” he told the kqyres. 

“For whom?” the kqyres asked; 
then added hastily, “Oh, yes, of 
course, Lyddy. We’ll do that right 
after we come back from the Vega 
System. There’s a little Earth-type 
planet out there—” 

“Before we go to Vega,” Mat- 
tern interrupted. “Now.” 

“But why the hurry? You’ye 
waited so long already—” 

“I’ve waited too long. I’m not 
young any more.” 

“Neither is she,” observed the 
kqyres. “Perhaps she is too old 
now, Mattern.” 

“She can’t be too old,” Mattem 
said. The tridi in his locker was 
Lyddy, and the picture was young; 
therefore, Lyddy must still be 
young. 

“She may have married some- 
one else. She may have numerous 
children clustering about her 
knee.” 

“Then I will take her away from 
her husband and children,” Mat- 
tern declared. “Can you imagine 



that a little thing like that would 
stop me?” 

“She may have lost her beauty,” 
the kqyres said. “She may have 
left Hesperia. She may have suf- 
fered a disfiguring accident.” 

1%/T ATTERN realized then that 
Njeri was deliberately try- 
ing to keep him from going back 
to Lyddy. Either he felt that she 
would interfere with the smooth 
operation of their business, or he 
was jealous of a third intruding 
into their company. 

“I have done everything I did 
for the sake of winning Lyddy,” 
Mattern said, biting off the words. 
“If all hope of her is gone, then 
my whole reason for working with 
you is gone. I will never go back 
to hyperspace.” 

“There are other women—” 
“Not for me!” 

“The business itself means 
nothing to you?” There was an ag- 
grieved note in the kqyres’ voice. 

“It’s just a living,” Mattern said, 
“just a way of getting Lyddy. You 
know that was why I went into 
it. I thought you’d been listening 
to me all these years.” 

“I thought perhaps with the 
deepening of your interests—” 
“They have only made me love 
her the more profoundly.” 

The kqyres took the equivalent 
of a deep breath. “You do not 
have a house or any regular place 
of residence. You cannot expect 



46 



GALAXY 



a lady to live permanently on a 
spaceship.” 

“I will build her a house.” 

“Will it not show her how care- 
fully you have prepared for her if, 
first, you build her a palace 
worthy—” 

“I have no time to build pal- 
aces.” 

“There is a tiny planet that cir- 
cles the dim sun you call Van 
Maanen’s star,” the alien persisted. 
“It is always twilight there. The 
beings who live on that planet 
build crystal towers miles high and 
as fragile as spun glass, in dusk 
colors the rainbow never dreamed 
of.” 

“If she wants a crystal tower, 
I will have one built for her. But 
first I will ask her.” 

“Very well,” the kqyres sighed, 
“since nothing else will satisfy you, 
let us return and fetch her.” 

And when they got to Erytheia 
City, Lyddy was still there, not 
only unmarried, but — in spite of 
all the years — unchanged. 

VII 

A ND now Mattern had been 
her husband for several 
months. He had begun to know 
her, and he realized that she 
could never be let known the 
truth about his life and his work. 
She would be frightened, and, if 
there was any emotion left over 
in her, angry. 



He told the kqyres: “I’ve been 
thinking of taking Lyddy to Bur- 
don. She might find distractions 
there that will take her mind off 
— things it shouldn’t be on. What 
do you think of the idea?” 

“I cannot tell,” the kqyres re- 
plied doubtfully. “I have a curious 
feeling ...” 

“That what?” Mattern prompted 
him anxiously. It was the first time 
he had seen the kqyres definitely 
at a loss, although it had seemed 
to him of recent months that the 
xhind’s assurance was beginning 
to ebb. 

“. that I am getting too old 
for my work,” the kqyres finished. 

“Nonsense!” Mattern cried. The 
kqyres was his tower of strength; 
he would not conceive of any 
weakness in him. It would mean 
that he would be forced to rely 
upon himself. And yet, he thought, 
I am certainly old and experi- 
enced enough by now to begin re- 
lying upon myself. In fact, I’m 
getting a little old and tired, too. 

“You know,” he said to his part- 
ner, “maybe we both ought to re- 
tire.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You’ve been at thte long 
enough and I’ve got all the money 
I want. We can see each other 
sometimes; no reason why I 
couldn’t go into hyperspace just 
to visit.” 

The kqyres paled to pearl. 
“Now that you have Lyddy, you 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



47 



don’t want anything else at all?” 
“Now that I have Lyddy, what 
else is there to want?” 

The kqyres flickered anxious- 
ly. “But the mbretersha has com- 
manded—” 

Mattern smiled. “Her com- 
mands don’t hold good in this uni- 
verse. You know that. When I was 
a kid, she could fool me into be- 
lieving she had a hold over me. 
But the hold is a psychological one; 
that’s the only thing that could 
carry over from universe to uni- 
verse. And I’m strong enough to 
break it now.” 

Although he was not quite seri- 
ous, it might be, he thought, that 
the hyperspace trade and the trips 
to Ferr had spoiled him for every- 
day life, made him too restless for 
the mundanities of any world. And 
it was time for him to settle down 
now. 

He let the kqyres win the game, 
and then he stood up. “I’d better 
start getting things ready for the 
trip to Burdon.” 

“You’ve definitely decided to 
go?” 

“Yes,” Mattern said, pleased 
with himself, “definitely.” 

He went to the control room 
and got out the forms that would 
need to be filled out before the 
ship could leave port. Suddenly he 
remembered his puzzlement about 
the young spaceman — what was 
his name? — Raines? He pressed 
a button on the file, and the boy’s 



records flashed up at him. At first 
they seemed to be in order: Alard 
Haines, aged twenty-five, educated 
on Earth, well and good. But born 
on Earth . Mattern was almost 
positive that could never have 
been, not from the way the young 
man spoke. And one false state- 
ment meant that the whole record 
was false. 

However, he could not chal- 
lenge the discrepancy before they 
left for Capella. If he spoke to 
Raines, he’d probably have to dis- 
miss him then and there. It would 
be difficult to find a suitable re- 
placement in Erytheia City. He 
might have to send for someone 
from Earth, which would take 
months, perhaps a year. First he’d 
take the Queen to Burdon, he de- 
cided, and then he would fire 
Raines. 

TV EARLY three weeks went by 

' before they could leave. Mat- 
tern found himself looking forward 
with some impatience to Burdon. 
When Lyddy had a house of her 
own that she could take an in- 
terest in, he told himself, things 
would be different; she would be 
different. This way she was bored 
much of the time, and boredom is 
contagious. 

“I’ve ’vised ahead to Capella, 
dear,” he told her as they boarded 
ship, “and rented a furnished mul- 
tiplex, so we’ll have some place to 
stay.” 



48 



GALAXY 



“Yes, honey,” she said, with a 
strange lack of interest. She didn’t 
even seem surprised at the size 
of the ship. Underneath her elab- 
orate makeup, she was pale; her 
body was trembling. She saw that 
an explanation was necessary. “It’s 
been so long since I made the 
Jump. Silly of me to be so nervous, 
but you do hear things about hy- 
perspace . .” 

“You’re safer in my ship than 
anywhere else.” 

“Yes, I know.” Was she merely 
expressing trust in him, or was 
there more to her words than that? 

At first he was just vaguely sus- 
picious. Then, the second day out, 
he noticed that Lyddy and Raines 
seemed to be together a good deal 
more of the time than chance 
would account for, and his sus- 
picions secured a focus. The two 
had some kind of unspoken under- 
standing, he thought, watching 
them as much out of curiosity as 
anger. I have become chilled with 
the years of alien company, he 
thought. 7 am incapable of true 
pass-on; perhaps that is what 
she seeks in another. 

But, though he might find ex- 
cuses for her, he would not con- 
done her. A bargain was a bargain. 
At the end of the first week, he 
said to her one evening, as he sat 
on the edge of the bed, watching 
her brush her long, thick gilded 
hair, “Darling, I’m a little worried 
about one of my crewmen.” 



Lyddy didn’t turn from the 
jeweled dressing table he’d had' 
especially installed for her. “Which 
one?” she asked. 

“Young Raines. Do you know 
which he is?” 

“Yes.” She paused. “There’s only 
one young one. Why are you wor- 
ried about him? Do you think he’s 
sick or something?” But that was 
the question she should have asked 
before asking the man’s identity. 

Mattern let a moment elapse, 
then said, “His papers appear to 
be forged.” 

He glanced at the reflection of 
her face, but it held neither relief 
nor fear, merely its usual sweet 
emptiness. “Maybe he needed a 
job real bad,” she said. 

“Maybe,” her husband agreed, 
“but why use forged papers?” 

“He might of gotten into some 
kind of trouble — you know how 
boys are.” 

“I’d hardly care to employ the 
kind of spaceman who gets into 
trouble serious enough for him to 
lose his papers. You have to do 
something pretty drastic to get 
them taken away, you know.” 

She said nothing. 

TTE went on, “What I’m begin- 
ning to suspect is that he isn’t 
really a trained spaceman at all, 
that he didn’t go to any of the 
Earth space schools.” 

“Do you have to go to an Earth 
space school to be a spaceman? 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



49 



Can’t you study somewhere else?” 
“Earth’s the only place where 
they give the conditioning.” He 
told the truth' figuring she wouldn’t 
understand. 

She turned to look at him. 
“That’s so the men shouldn’t — 
see the things outside when they 
go through hyperspace, isn’t it?” 
Mattern was somewhat taken 
aback. “How did you know? It’s 
not public information.” 

She shrugged and turned back 
to the dressing table. “I’ve known 
a lot of spacemen, hon.” 

Her face was pale, but why just 
now? He wondered just what 
Raines had told her — how much 
the boy actually knew. Naturally 
there could be only one possible 
reason he had chosen Lyddy as 
his confidante. 

“There’s something between you 
and Raines, isn’t there?” he asked. 

There was a slight delay. Then 
her laughter shrilled through the 
cabin. “Don’t be silly, hon; I hardly 
know the man! All I’ve done was 
speak to him a couple of times!” 
She got up and put her soft arms 
around her husband. “You’re jeal- 
ous, Len,” she said, and there was 
complacency mixed with the fright 
in her eyes. 

He felt a pang of disgust, but 
tried not to let it show. Gently, he 
put her away from him. 

“But that’s so silly,” she mur- 
mured. “How could I prefer a 
dumb pimply kid to you?” 



In theory, that was quite true, 
but Len knew women had strange 
tastes. And possibly “a dumb 
pimply kid” had more to offer her 
emotionally and, in reverse, in- 
tellectually, than he had. It was 
not impossible that she was telling 
the truth, but Mattern could not, 
of course, believe her. And there 
was no point in making a further 
issue of it now. When they reached 
Burdon, he would fire Raines sim- 
ply on the basis of the forged 
papers. No need to bring Lyddy 
into it at all. So that problem 
would be easily solved, but what 
of the others? 

He went to play chess with the 
kqyres. “I trust you have got over 
your whimsical notion to retire,” 
the xhind said hopefully. 

“No,” Len told him maliciously, 
“I’ve practically made up my mind 
to quit. There doesn’t seem to be 
any point to it any more.” 

“The woman has changed! 
That’s the whole trouble, isn’t it? 
Even though it’s not apparent, in 
some way she has changed?” 

“No,” Len said again, “she hasn’t 
changed at all. In fact, I think 
that’s what the trouble is. She 
hasn’t changed, but I have.” 

“I never thought of that,” the 
kqyres confessed. 

^ I 'HE night of the Jump, Mat- 
tern turned in at the kqyres’ 
suggestion. “For once, your men 
can take care of the ship,” the 



50 



GALAXY 



xhind said, “since there will be 
no trading stop.” Lyddy would be 
drugged, but Mattern would not 
need drugs, for hyperspace held 
no more horrors for him. Or so he 
thought. 

But that night he was awak- 
ened by the sound of a screaming 
so hideous that, if he hadn’t known 
voices don’t change during the hy- 
perjump, he would be tempted to 
think it was one result of the law 
of mutability — so monstrous were 
these shrill, worse-than-animal 
cries. 

tTE rushed out of his cabin. 

In the corridor stood Lyddy, 
still screaming, her face contorted 
with terror that only the sight of 
Alard Raines standing there in his 
normal shape let Mattern know 
that they had already passed the 
Jump. 

The shrieking separated into 
words. “I saw it! It was horrible!” 
And she made an ugly noise in her 
throat. “You were right, Alard. It’s 
true! There’s a monster on board 
and it did something awful to 
me . .” Her voice ebbed to a 
bubble as she looked down at her 
body beneath the thin veil of 
fabric and found the same voluptu- 
ous curves she had started out 
with. 

Mattern sighed. “Better come 
into my cabin, Lyddy.” And then 
he jerked his head at Raines. “You 
come, too.” He paused in the door- 



way when he saw there was no 
need for privacy. “Where are the 
other crewmen?” 

“Asleep,” Raines said. “Drugged. 
As usual. Who do you think you’re 
fooling, anyway?” 

Mattern was too disturbed at 
the news to take notice of the 
boy’s manner. “But they weren’t 
supposed to be drugged this trip! 
And who’s in charge then? You?” 

Raines flushed and struggled to 
pronounce the word he wanted to 
use in return. ‘Your kek — kqyres, 
I’d say, is in charge. Like he al- 
ways has been,” he concluded tri- 
umphantly. 

Mattern shut the cabin door be- 
hind the three of them. Lyddy 
went over and sat down on the 
edge of the bunk, quieter now that 
she found her personal transforma- 
tion had been ephemeral. Seeing a 
monster is not, after all, anywhere 
near as bad as being a monster. 
Her fright dimmed and was out- 
shone by a strong sense of per- 
sonal injury. 

“I thought all Alard’s talk ®f 
kek-kek-monsters was just super- 
stition,” she babbled, “but it’s true. 
I saw that thing with my own eyes 
and it’s hideous! Len, why do you 
have it on board, especially when 
I’m here?” 

“I have to,” Len said. “He’s my 
partner.” 

Her blue eyes widened in shock. 
“Then you’ve been doing more 
than just trading with the hyper- 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



51 



spacers. You’e been associating 
with them, and they’re even worse 
than extraterrestrials because 
they’re so much more — extra- 
terrestrial!” 

She went on talking in this vein, 
but Mattern ignored her and 
turned his attention to the boy. “I 
suppose you told her not to eat or 
drink anything so she’d see the 
hyperspacer?” 

Raines nodded, his face essay- 
ing contempt but imperfectly con- 
cealing terror. 

“And I suppose you yourself did 
the same thing, not knowing the 
men weren’t going to be drugged 
this trip?” Len sat down behind 
his writing table and looked 
thoughtfully at the young man. 
“You must have done the same 
thing before, on other trips, to 
know as much as you seem to. 
You must have heard and seen a 
great deal, eh?” 

“Plenty,” Raines said, through 
brave, stiff lips. “Plenty.” 

Obviously the boy hates me, 
Mattern thought. But why? Is 
Lyddy enough reason? 

a Vj^HY did you bring her into 
^ this?” he asked, almost 
mildly. 

Lyddy didn’t give Alard a 
chance to answer. “Because he 
wanted me to see you as you really 
are!” she shrieked. 

The boy shuffled his feet. “I had 
to tell somebody.” 



“Why my wife, though? She 
owes you nothing; she owes me 
everything. The first woman of 
the streets you picked up would 
have made a safer confidante.” 
“Maybe I trusted her.” 
“Maybe you had no right to 
trust her!” Mattern cried, almost 
with sincerity. “It would have been 
wrong of her not to tell me.” 
“Maybe it was because I — I 
love her,” Alard said, looking down 
at the thick rugs that covered the 
cabin floor. “If you fall in love 
with somebody, you tell them 
things.” 

Mattern couldn’t help smiling. 
“I never do,” he said. 

“Maybe you’ve never been in 
love. Maybe you don’t have any 
human feelings at all.” 

There was an uncomfortable 
feeling in Mattern’s shoulders, as 
if his tailor had made a mistake 
for once. Had he, during sixteen 
years of alien trade, changed into 
something not quite human? Was 
there then a solid basis for the 
anti-extraterrestrial prejudice? He 
picked up a slender, sharp thike 
and ran his thumb absent-minded- 
ly along the blade. Alard stiffened 
in his effort not to flush. 

Mattern smiled and laid the 
thike down on the table. It was 
only a paperknife and had never 
been used for anything more. If he 
ever had need for such a thing to 
be done, the time was long past 
when he would have needed to do 



52 



GALAXY 



it himself. He looked at the crew- 
man. 

“One would almost think you 
told my wife because you wanted 
her to tell me,” he suggested. 

“That’s ridiculous!” Alard 
flashed. “I may be a fool, but not 
that much of a fool!” 

“Why are you on my ship with 
forged papers then?” Mattern de- 
manded. 

“I wanted — I wanted to bring 
you to justice.” 

“By committing a crime your- 
self? Surely a roundabout way. 
And why have you taken it upon 
yourself to help rid humanity of 
me?” 

“Why shouldn’t I?” Alard asked. 
“I’m a human being; isn’t that 
enough? But, as a matter of fact, 
that wasn’t the reason I came to 
your ship. I only found out later 
what you were doing.” 

Mattem waited patiently. 

“You killed my father!” the boy 
burst out. And then tension 
seemed to ebb from him, as if the 
worst had happened. “So now you 
know who I am!” 

Mattern picked his words deli- 
cately. “If you have proof that I 
murdered your father, why don’t 
you prosecute? There’s no statute 
of limitation on murder on any 
of the planets. Or don’t you have 
proof?” 

Alard’s voice broke slightly. 
“Everybody on Fairhurst knows 
you killed him, but they won’t do 



ansrthing about it. They say he 
deserved what he got.” 

1V|' ATTERN sighed, knowing 
now who the young man was. 
His brother. Another responsi- 
bility, another vain tie. “How do 
you know, he didn’t deserve what 
he got?” Mattern asked. 

Suddenly Alard grew shy. He 
lowered his eyes to the rug again. 
“Because I didn’t deserve what / 
got.” 

And there, Mattern thought, 
Alard had him. Whatever the boy 
was now, he certainly had not de- 
served what he’d got then. But I 
was only sixteen, Mattern argued 
with himself; how could I have 
been held responsible? And then 
he told himself. You haven’t been 
sixteen for twenty-four years. 

“I thought one of the women 
in the village would have adopted 
you,” he said. 

“One of ’em did. They took rne 
away from her after she beat me 
so hard she practically killed me. 
Every little thing I did wrong, she 
said it was the bad blood coming 
out in me, and beat me so hard 
the blood did come. I went from 
one family to another, but nobody 
really wanted me.” His voice 
cracked wide across. “You don’t 
know what it’s like to grow up 
with nobody caring for you!” 

“It so happens I do,” Mattern 
said, “but I can’t expect you to be- 
lieve me.” 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



53 



Alard wasn’t interested in Mat- 
tern’s life story; he wanted to wal- 
low in his own in front of a captive 
audience. “The only hope I had 
was that you would come back for 
me some day. They told me you 
were probably dead, but I wouldn’t 
believe it, see? It was all I had to 
hang onto.” 

“I thought you were part of a 
family,” Mattern tried to defend 
himself. “I thought you belonged 
to somebody.” He almost con- 
vinced himself that this was true, 
but, at the back of his mind, some- 
thing whispered. You ditched him. 

“When I was sixteen, like you’d 
been, I ran away to look for you. 
I found out where you’d gone and 
I followed. I even stayed a while 
with the flluska. I liked them bet- 
ter than my own people. They said 
I should try looking for you in 
hyperspace.” 

“They are a very wise people,” 
Mattern said. 

Alard hadn’t had his brother’s 
luck. None of the great starships 
offered him a berth. But there 
were unchartered vessels — smug- 
glers and pirates and worse — that 
would hire anybody who didn’t 
value his life very highly and 
knew how to keep his mouth shut. 
He got jobs on them. And as the 
bandit ships he sailed on took 
Jumps closer and closer in to the 
more sophisticated sectors, Alard 
began to hear of a Len Mattern. 
It took him a long time before he 



could bring himself to believe that 
this king of finance was the brother 
whom he had imagined finding 
derelict and penniless. Instead, he 
was rich and oblivious, not need- 
ing anything the younger man 
could give him. 

It was then that Alard deter- 
mined revenge. It took him years 
to save up enough money to buy 
the false papers he needed — more 
years to buy his way into Mat- 
tern’s crew. And, finally, he had 
achieved his end; he was there. 

UT you’ve been with me al- 
most a year now,” Mattern 
pointed out, “and done nothing ex- 
cept talk to Lyddy against me. 
What were you planning to do?” 
“I don’t know,” the boy said 
hopelessly. “Lots of times I thought 
of killing you, but then I’d be 
killing the only relative I had.” 
“You could have told me who 
you were. I’d have done something 
for you.” 

Alard’s eyes blazed. “Yes, you 
would have. When it’s easy, when 
it wouldn’t mean a damn thing to 
you, you’d do something for me!” 
Len pulled out a smokestick and 
offered it to the boy. Alard shook 
his head impatiently. Len lit one 
for himself. Neither of them said 
anything. 

Lyddy was sobbing softly. “You 
never really loved me,” she whim- 
pered. “It was just a way of getting 
back at Len.” 



54

Alard looked away from her, 
met his brother’s eye, and dropped 
his gaze to the rug, without deny- 
ing the impeachment. 

Mattern exhaled smoke. “All 
right, you had a grudge against 
me, but what did you have against 
her? If you were using her to get 
back at me, then I think you have 
no cause to reproach me for any- 
thing I did. Maybe your foster- 
mother was right; there is bad 
blood in the family.” 

The young spaceman was still 
silent. 

Lyddy lifted her head. There 
was resolution on her tear-smudged 
face. “I’m going to leave you, Len! 
I can’t go on living with a man 
who does the awful, evil, unnatural 
things you do . .” Her voice 
petered out as her vocabulary 
proved unequal to her emotions. 
Poor Lyddy, he thought. And then, 
Poor Len, with emotions unequal 
to his vocabulary. 

“Everything I did, I did for 
your sake, Lyddy,” he told her 
softly, but no longer with any hope 
of her comprehension. “It was be- 
cause I was poor and couldn’t af- 
ford your love that I went into 
hyperspace.” He couldn’t help 
adding, “Doesn’t it mean anything 
to you that I risked a whole uni- 
verse for your sake, and that now 
I have worlds to offer you?” 

“Don’t put the blame on me, 
Len Mattern!” Angry tears stood 
in her eyes. “I never wanted any- 



body to do that much for me. All 
I wanted were nice things and 
somebody to take care of me and 
maybe love me. I never wanted to 
have the whole universe risked for 
me.” Her voice broke on the 
truth. “Nobody’s worth all that!” 
She was right, he thought — 
being given too much can be worse 
than being given too little. The 
words spilled out of her; he’d been 
so disenchanted by her stupidity 
that he gave her credit for less un- 
derstanding than she did have. 

“You wouldn’t’ve been able to 
wait fifteen-sixteen years for me 
if you really loved me. But you 
were happy the way you were — 
you and that extraterrestrial of 
yours. All you wanted was to 
dream about me. You were a fool 
ever to have come back for me; 
you shoulda stuck with your 
dreams.” 

A ND again, he knew, she was 
right. He felt very tired and 
empty, the way he’d felt after 
Schiemann and Balas had died, as 
if nothing mattered any more. He 
didn’t argue with her. 

“What would you do if you left 
me, Lyddy?” he asked gently. 

“I can always — ” she swallowed 
— “go back to my old job, I guess.” 
Alard gave an exclamation of 
horror, and Mattern agreed in his 
mind that that solution would 
never do. Beyond a doubt, she 
was his responsibility. And so was

Alard. Why had he ever longed 
for a family? 

And then an outside mind 
joined in with his and he knew 
what to do. 

“Alard,” he said, ‘Tjefore, I of- 
fered to do something for you. 
Now I’m not going to do anything 
for you, not a damn thing.” 



Alard drew himself erect. “I 
wouldn’t expect you to, see? Even 
if you wanted to, I wouldn’t 
take — ” 

“I want you to do something for 
me,” Mattern cut in. 

Alard paled, then flushed with 
anger. “If this is some half-baked 
way of thinking you can make

up for things without me feeling—” 
“Hear me out before you leap 
to conclusions. You said that you 
loved my wife . 

Lyddy gave a moan. “You know 
he was only stringing me along to 
get back at you.” 

“He wouldn’t have done that,” 
said Mattern. “Not a fine, up- 



standing boy like Alard, no matter 
how much he hated me. You really 
love Lyddy, don’t you, Alard — 
as you said before?” 

The boy looked frightened. 
“Only in a manner of speaking,” 
he said quickly. “I was trying to 
make you jealous. I think of her 
as a sister — a sister-in-law.” 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



57 



“She’s very beautiful,” Mattern 
reminded him. And the xhindi had 
done their work well. She hadn’t 
changed; they had preserved her 
for him just as she had been six- 
teen years before. If only they had 
let her change, then things might 
have worked out They could have 
kept the body from growing old 
without holding back the mind — 
or had they not held back the 
mind? Was this the fullest matur- 
ity it was capable of? 

“A man who has her as his wife 
should be very happy,” Mattern 
pointed out. “You wouldn’t want 
her to go back to what she’d been 
doing, and she won’t stay with me.” 
“Yes, sure.” There was a desper- 
ate note in the boy’s voice. “But 
she’s not young. I mean for me — 
although, of course, she looks 
young,” he added, with a wild 
glance in her direction. “And she’s 
not very — she isn’t — ” 

Mattern got up and put his 
hand on his brother’s shoulder. 
“Then if you feel that way about 
her and do as I ask, it will really 
be a favor to me.” 

“Why should I do you a favor?” 
Alard demanded. His eyes darted 
back and forth like an animal that 
is beginning to realize it is caught 
in a trap. 

“To prove you’re the better 
man,” Mattern told him. “To heap 
coals of fire on my head. To prove 
that if there’s bad blood in the 
family, it exists only in me.” 



Alard didn’t ask what Mattern 
wanted him to do. He knew al- 
ready. 

1YW ATTERN put it into words: 
iTJ. «j vvant you to take her with 
you.” 

“Take her,” Alard repeated 
numbly. “Where?” 

“Anywhere she wants to go — 
to Earth or back to Erytheia, or 
any one of the planets she 
chooses.” 

“Will she go with me?” Alard 
challenged. “You have to ask her; 
she has the right — ” 

“Oh, I’ll go with you, Alard,” 
Lyddy interrupted joyfully. “I’d 
go with anybody right now, but 
especially you.” 

“Even if you know I love you 
only as a sister?” 

“That’s better than nothing,” 
Lyddy said. “Besides, you could 
change your mind. I think you and 
me have a lot more in common 
than him and me.” 

“I want to make sure there will 
always be someone to take care 
of her, to watch over her,” Mat- 
tern told his brother. “Funny, I 
wouldn’t have done what I did ex- 
cept for the sake of winning her, 
and now that I’ve won her, I can’t 
hold her because of what I did to 
get her. But she was my dream 
and I want her to be cherished.” 
“That’s noble of you, Len,” 
Lyddy said. “I’ll think of you often, 
and I won’t be mad at you.” She 



58 



GALAXY 



got up and linked her arm in 
Alard’s. “You’ll take good care of 
me, won’t you, hon?” 

But it was to his brother that 
Alard spoke. “I’ll take good care 
of her,” he promised, his voice 
thick with an emotion that was 
one part sentiment, one part resig- 
nation. 

“Splendid,” Mattern said. “I 
wouldn’t want her to be cast adrift. 
She knows so little of any of the 
worlds outside her own restricted 
sphere.” 

“Sure,” Alard replied miserably, 
“I understand. I’ll do my best.” 

Mattern got up and put out his 
hand and, after a little hesitation, 
Alard took it. 

“I hope in time you’ll come to 
forgive me,” Mattern said, “and 
that your hatred will dwindle into 
dislike, perhaps even tolerance.” 

“Oh, I don’t hate you any more,” 
Alard assured him. “I guess, in 
your way, you’ve had as much to 
put up with as I did.” He frowned 
in perplexity. “But why did it have 
to be me?” 

“You’ll change your mind about 
that, too,” Mattern said comfort- 
ably. “Lyddy is a very accom- 
plished woman.” 

VIII 

TTE felt quite cheerful as he left 
the two together in his cabin. 
At long last, he was free of re- 
sponsibility, of illusion, of dreams. 



He didn’t need a woman; it would 
be wrong for him to expect a 
woman to live with the kqyres, 
even unwittingly. Love was for 
the very young; he had his work. 
And now that he was free of all 
these vexing human entanglements, 
he’d be able to take hold of the 
business the way he should have 
been doing all along. The kqyres 
was getting old; it was time to 
assume the details of management 
himself. There were quite a few 
areas of operation which could be- 
come even more productive if the 
business was thoroughly reorgan- 
ized. 

Mattern went up to the control 
room. The kqyres was there, which 
was not his usual place. Perhaps 
Alard had been right when he said 
it was Njeri who had drugged the 
other crewmen and taken control 
of the ship. Presently, Mattern 
would ask him why, but there were 
other matters to be discussed first. 

“Well,” Mattern said, flinging 
himself into a chair, “Lyddy seems 
to be disposed of satisfactorily.” 
He gave a rueful laugh. “I take it 
you had a hand in the arrange- 
ments. That was only fair — she’s 
your creation.” He waved his 
smokestick at the xhind. “How- 
ever, I’m warning you, I won’t let 
myself be manipulated any more. 
You’re through pushing me 
around.” 

The kqyres seemed almost of- 
fended. Then there came a soft 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



59 



chuckle. “Manipulated, nonsense! 
We merely deluded you a little, 
in the same manner you were 
wont to delude yourself, but more 
purposefully. In truth, what else 
could we do? We needed you, and 
in order to induce you to accept 
our terms, we had to establish 
some goal, some ideal for you to 
aim at.” 

Something about the kqyres’ 
voice disturbed Mattern; he only 
half listened as the hyperspacer 
continued: “And the resources of 
your mind were so pitifully meager 
at that time that this woman was 
the best we could dredge up. Later, 
when your horizons had broadened 
and your perceptions deepened, 
we attempted to alter your goal to 
a more worthy one, but the woman 
had already become an obses- 
sion . .” 

“You’re not the kqyres,” Mat- 
tern interrupted. “You have a dif- 
ferent voice.” 

“Not the same kqyres,” the 
voice corrected. “Truly, it was un- 
fair to make Lord Njeri go through 
a thing like this twice in one life- 
time. Moreover, as he grew old, 
he grew careless.” 

So that was why the men had 
been drugged. There had been an 
unscheduled stop in hyperspace. 

Mattern got up and looked in- 
tently at the shadowy form. The 
xhind flickered a little, as if in 
embarrassment, and embarked al- 
most nervously upon an explana- 



tion. “You were never intended 
to attain Lyddy, merely to keep 
her image before you like the star 
a mariner follows but can never 
reach.” And then the kqyres 
laughed. “Except, of course, that 
today he can reach his star.” 

“A carrot and a donkey might 
be a more suitable simile,” Mat- 
tern said. “Pity you couldn’t have 
provided a better carrot.” 

The new kqyres ignored this 
comment. “Lord Njeri was trans- 
ferred. He has asked me to say 
that he looks forward to the plea- 
sure of renewing your friendship 
when you come again to Ferr. 
Meanwhile, I have taken his 
place.” After some hesitation, the 
new kqyres added, “I hope we 
shall be good friends, also.” 

There was no use pretending 
any longer. “I know who you are,” 
Mattern said. “I recognize your 
voice. You’re the mbretersha her- 
self, aren’t you?” 

OHE seemed pleased rather than 
dismayed. “Yes, I am the 
mbretersha. I came to realize that 
the post of kqyres was more diffi- 
cult than that of queen. There- 
fore, I was the only one who 
should rightfully undertake it As 
I told you, in our universe a ruler 
cannot afford pride. She lives only 
for the good of her people.” 

“She’s got to,” Mattern said 
bluntly, “if, as you said, her nerv- 
ous system is attuned to theirs. 



60 



GALAXY 



What actually did happen is that 
Njeri told you I was quitting the 
business and he couldn’t control 
me any more. So you took his 
place to see if you could change 
my mind.” 

“Oh, that was a mere plea- 
santry!” she said. “I knew you 
would not give up the hyperspace 
trade. What else would you have 
left?” 

What else would he have left? 
His money, his collections, his un- 
pleasant memories. All his emo- 
tional ties now were with that 
other universe. 

“Who’s ruling Ferr?” he asked, 
evading her question. 

“Lord Njeri, your former kqyres, 
serves as my regent. He is my 
father, so he is fitted by birth; his 
system is also attuned to the plan- 
et’s, although not as sensitively as 
mine, since he is a male. Perhaps 
that would make him a better 
ruler; he will suffer less. And I see 
no reason otherwise why a male 
should be deemed incapable of 
ruling, providing he is under care- 
ful supervision.” 

“No reason at all,” Mattern 
agreed. 

“Moreover,” she continued, “I 
have organized the whole govern- 
ment of my planet so that it runs 
itself. And, of course, from time 
to time, when we make our trips, 
I shall be able to check into what’s 
going on.” 

“But we’re not going to make 



any more trips,” he said. Although 
he had not been serious about re- 
tiring — he knew that now — he 
wasn’t going to let the hyper- 
spacers push him around. Make 
her sweat a little, he thought ir- 
reverently. 

“Will you not give me a chance, 
Captain?” she asked. “Is the pros- 
pect of my company so displeasing 
to you that it will make you give 
up the business immediately?” 

“You know it’s not that. I told 
the kqyres before you came — ” 

“But my people won’t know it’s 
not that. I shall lose face.” 

“If only you had a face!” he 
cried. “I’m sick of sailing with 
shadows!” 

“My form in your universe is 
truly horrible, Mattern,” she said 
softly, “truly monstrous. The 
xhindi who have seen themselves 
in mirrors in your universe have 
often gone mad.” 

“Anything is better than empti- 
ness,” he told her. 

“If I appear in my true form, 
then will you accept me as your 
kqyres?” 

“Well,” he said, enjoying him- 
self, “I’ll make a few more trips 
with you, but that’s all I’ll prom- 
ise.” 

“I accept your promises,” she 
said. 

He felt a tiny shiver rise up in 
him. Suppose her normspace form 
was even more hideous than her 
hyperspace form, which of course. 



SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME 



61 



was no longer hideous to him. 
Would his nerves be strong enough 
to bear it? 

II E held his breath as the vibra- 
tions began to slow down, the 
grays shimmering into substance, 
taking on all the colors of the rain- 
bow and then flowing into one 
basic roseate hue. Bit by bit, the 
planes and shapes began to co- 
alesce into the shape of . 

A woman. The most beautiful 
woman he had ever seen. A woman 
next to whom even the dream of 
Lyddy paled into thin air. 

And, momentarily, he became 
the Len Mattern of fifteen years 
back, standing there with his mouth 
agape. “But you said you’d be a 
monster . .” 

“To my people, Mattern,” she 
smiled, “this form is as monstrous 
as ours is to your people. You 
change into our doubles in hyper- 
space; we change into yours in 
normspace. Had you kept the con- 
tinuity of tradition that we have, 
you would know what we have al- 
ways known — that xhind and hu- 
man are different aspects of the 
same race. That is why you fear 
us, and we do not fear you.” 

Of course, he thought. How else 
could they understand us so well? 
How else could they find lo^ic in 
our il logic and be able to condition 
us according to our human na- 
tures? And he smiled to think that 
all objection to the xhindi from the 



social angle was invalid. Monsters 
they might be, but not non- 
humans. 

“Once I thought this appearance 
was monstrous, Mattern,” the 
mbretersha went on, in the sweet 
voice which suited her now, “be- 
cause I thought you and your kind 
were, though forms of our race, 
monstrous forms — not only with- 
out beauty, but without dignity or 
intelligence or compassion.” 

“Maybe you were right,” he 
said. 

“But since I have learned to 
know you and to — like you, I 
have come to realize that outward 
semblances are meaningless. I 
may appear one way in your uni- 
verse, another way in mine, but I 
am the same I. If there is beauty 
— ” and she gave what, in a lesser 
personage, would have been almost 
a giggle — “it is an inner beauty.” 

Mattern could not agree with 
this premise. Although he had ad- 
mired the mbretersha on Ferr, he 
felt quite differently toward her 
now, and because of no suddenly 
discovered inner beauty. 

“You’ll stay this way in this uni- 
verse then?” he asked. “It makes 
it so much more comfortable for 
me — than just a collection of 
shadows,” he added hastily. 

“I will stay this way perma- 
nently while I am in your uni- 
verse, Mattern,” she told him, “if, 
in your turn, you will accept me 
as — as — ” 



62 



GALAXY 



“As my shipmate,” Mattern fin- 
ished, “my kqyres. I have already 
done so.” 

“Not merely as your shipmate.” 

“As my — wife?” he blurted, 
wondering whether he was reading 
her mind or whether she was pro- 
jecting so forcibly into his that he 
merely spoke her thoughts for her. 

She nodded. 

To be chained again, after this 
brief moment of freedom! He 
wanted her, right enough, and he 
was delighted to have her for his 
partner, his companion, but he 
saw no need for formal commit- 
ments between them. 

“You’re the mbretersha,” he pro- 
tested, “the queen. It wouldn’t be 
right for you to marry a com- 
moner!” 

“And you,” she retorted, “are 
one of nature’s own noblemen, and, 
hence, a fitting consort for me. 
There is no one in either universe 
whom I could marry without 
lowering myself,” she explained, 
“so I might as well wed where 
there is a basis of respect, of ad- 
miration, and, to be sure, expedi- 
ency.” 

“But — but our ceremony 
wouldn’t be valid in your universe, 
would it?” he spluttered wildly. 
“And your ceremony — ” 

“We will have two ceremonies, 
Mattern, one in each universe.” 

This, he could see in alarm, was 
going to be a truly lasting mar- 
riage. 



1%/f ATTERN was happy with 
the mbretersha, for she knew 
how to satisfy a man’s every 
dream as well as his desires, and 
of course, being the kqyres, she 
was the only woman who would 
not be disturbed by the presence 
of one on board. Moreover, she 
was a woman for whom a universe 
could be risked, a woman to whom 
worlds could be offered — in short, 
just as he was the only man 
worthy of her, so she was the only 
woman worthy of him. 

But sometimes he fancied that 
the mbretersha’s blue eyes had the 
same haunting familiarity that he 
had seen in Lyddy’s and Alard’s, 
and he wondered. Alard’s had been 
explicable enough; he and Mattern 
had had the same mother. But 
why should Lyddy also have his 
mother’s eyes — and, stranger still, 
why should the mbretersha? 

Len could not help wondering 
whether, to create the ideal fan- 
tasy, the ultimate carrot, the xhindi 
had reached far back in his mind 
to get the earliest — and thus the 
most fundamental — illusion of 
beauty for him. Could both Lyddy 
and the mbretersha have been de- 
liberately modeled on his mother, 
and was the mbretersha’s form in 
normspace merely whatever she 
chose it to be — or appear to be? 

Oh, well, he thought, perhaps an 
artful illusion is the truest form of 
reality.

THE MORTICIANS 

By E. C. TUBB 

Business was dead, the victim 
of a mercy killing — what else 
could they do now but bury it? 



illustrated by JOHNSON 



I T was a smoking day in sum- 
mer and Centre Forks, Pop. 
12,057, palpitated in the heat. 
From above, a plane sent down a 
fading murmur while, in the val- 
ley, a train bored its rustling way 
toward the west. A few turbocars 
carrying housewives to their clubs 
hummed down Main Street and 
a solitary dog scratched itself list- 
lessly in the shade. 



Centre Forks was a quiet town. 
“It would be nice,” said Eph- 
raim Fingle wistfully, staring at 
the sky, “if the Businessman’s Spe- 
cial would go wrong somehow and 
crack up on Old Candy.” 

The Businessman’s Special car- 
ried 300 commuters and Old Can- 
dy was the local mountain. 

“It would be better,” said Luke 
Earguard, even more wistfully, 



64 



GALAXY 



“if the Silver Streak jumped the 
rails at Morgan’s Crossing.” 

The Silver Streak carried 3,000 
passengers and Morgan’s Crossing 
was five miles closer to Centre 
Forks than Old Candy. 

Both men sighed longingly at 
the prospect. 

Across the street, the doors of 
Sam’s Tavern flapped OF>en and 
Joe Weston, the town drunk, stag- 
gered blearily onto the sidewalk. 
A car, a blur of red and green, 
came ghosting down the street as 
he stepped onto the pavement. 
Taking a sight on the glaring patch 
of color which was the public TV 
screen, Joe weaved his way to- 
ward it. Both Ephraim and Luke 
tensed as the path of the car and 
the path of the drunk coincided. 

“Perhaps?” Ephraim was an 
optimist. 

“No such luck.” Luke was a 
pessimist, and Luke was right. 

' I '' HE snatch-field, as always, 
operated with its usual efficien- 
cy. The car hummed on. The 
drunk, picking himself up from 
where the field had deposited him, 
staggered wildly for a moment be- 
fore getting his bearings, then 
lunged back across the street. The 
flap of the tavern doors was 
echoed by Ephraim’s sigh of dis- 
appointment. 

“What this town needs,” he said 
with deep conviction, “is a good, 
first-class funeral.” 



“A hearse and fifteen cars,” said 
Luke. “Limousines, big, black and 
dignified.” 

“A hand-carved mahogany cas- 
ket with red silk lining and solid 
silver hardware.” 

“Calla lilies,” said Luke. “A 
truckload of tributes and the 
‘Death March’ from Saul.” 

“Not Saul,” protested Ephraim. 
“Too depressing.” 

“Maybe you’re right.” Luke had 
his own ideas, but it was too hot 
to argue with his ex-rival turned 
partner. He scowled as the dream 
faded. “The guy I’d like to bury,” 
he said savagely, “is that Ambas- 
sador What’s-his-name.” 

“Sigk Gesligk.” The name was 
written on Ephraim’s heart. “From 
Rigel,” he added. 

“That’s the one.” Luke’s scowl 
deepened. “For him, I’d supply 
a split-pine box full of splinters.” 
“Cut small,” agreed Ephraim. 
“Without lining.” 

“Galvanized handles and no 
flowers.” 

“No embalming and no mutes.” 
“No mutes, mourners or music.” 
“Planted in unhallowed ground.” 
“The bum,” said Luke. 

Which was rather an odd way 
to talk about the greatest bene- 
factor the human race had ever 
known. 

13 ROGRESS is relentless; some- 
-*■ one always has to go to the 
wall, but that someone can’t be

expected to like it. There were 
compensations, both men admitted 
that, but they wouldn’t have been 
human if they hadn’t, at times, 
longed for the good old days. 
When Sigk Gesligk had arrived, 
bringing with him the secret of 
immortality, he had dealt a death 
blow to an honored profession. 

The morticians had gone to the 
wall. 

There was still a little work, of 
course, but it wasn’t the same. 
Ephraim sighed as he retailed their 
last burial. Mrs. Chadwell’s pet dog, 
a horrible little Peke, had rashly 
eaten rat poison instead of the 
boned chicken provided and had 
passed on with suitable dispatch. 
The whole town had turned out to 
witness the ceremony. 

But burying a dog, no matter 
how you looked at it, wasn’t the 
same thing. It lacked a certain 
dignity, if nothing else, and both 
Ephraim and Luke were highly 
conscious of the dignity of their 
profession. 

“It isn’t as if we can rely on 
accidents,” Luke had said when 
they had first discussed the idea 
of amalgamation. “What with the 
snatch-fields and other gimmicks 
to save fools from their folly, ac- 
cidents just don’t happen now.” 

“Suicide?” Ephraim had men- 
tioned the good old reliable stand- 
by. 

Luke had shaken his head. “Peo- 
ple don’t get depressed now,” he 



pointed out. “Not that depressed, 
anyway. No, the only way is for 
us to become partners and save 
expenses. It’s that or both go out 
of business.” 

But, from the look of it, they 
had only staved off the inevitable. 

The hound finished scratching 
itself and wandered off to investi- 
gate certain trees. Joe Weston, 
reeling even more now than be- 
fore, left the tavern and managed 
to cross the street without further 
indignity. Slowly, as the heat 
faded, the town came to life. A 
group of youngsters wandered past 
staring, as usual, at the urns, head- 
stones, caskets and wreaths in the 
parlor window. 

Luke shook his head as he lis- 
tened to their comments. 

“Finished,” he mourned. “Ended. 
Even the kids haven’t respect for 
us now.” 

“Ghouls,” Ephraim said won- 
deringly, and shuddered at the 
word. “I’ve never been called that 
before.” 

“Ephraim,” said Luke, “the pro- 
fession is dead. Let’s face it.” 

“Maybe not.” Ephraim didn’t 
like to admit it. “Maybe it’s just 
a recession. Maybe there’ll be a 
plague or something.” 

“Not a chance.” Luke sounded 
bitter. “We’ve hung on to the last, 
Ephraim, but now we’re finished. 
There’s nothing left but for us to 
sell out and get jobs in a food 
factory.”

¥ T was hard, but it had to be 
faced; even Ephraim had to 
agree that waiting for a plague was 
a forlorn hope. His sigh sounded 
like a jet liner passing overhead. 

“I guess you’re right, Luke,” he 
said dispiritedly. “But it’s a pity. 
I’d liked to have had one really 
first-class funeral before the end.” 
A thought brightened his eye. 
“Luke!” 

“Uh?” 

“You said the profession’s dead. 
Right?” 

“We’re the last of the morti- 
cians,” said Luke. “When we quit, 
it’ll be the end of the profession.” 
“Fair enough. But when a thing’s 
dead, what do you do with it?” 
“How’s that again?” 

“You bury it, that’s what.” 
Ephraim was triumphant. “Get it? 
We’ll hold one last ceremony, give 
it the works, and we’ll symbolical- 
ly inter the entire profession.” He 
noticed Luke’s expression. “No?” 
“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“It’s symbolic, sure, but the 
whole thing will be treated as a 
joke. You heard those kids. How 
do you think people will react to 
us burying an empty casket?” 
Ephraim knew the answer to 
that one. 

“They’ll laugh themselves sick, 
that’s what.” Luke became thought- 
ful. “But what if the casket wasn’t 
empty? Or if they didn’t know it 
was?” 



“What’s on your mind?” Eph- 
raim was beginning to regret he’d 
ever thought of the idea. 

“I’ve got an idea.” Luke nodded 
his head thoughtfully as the de- 
tails fell into place. “We’ll have 
our funeral, but we’ll do it right. 
As far as anyone will know, there’ll 
be a real body. That means they 
will treat it with respect, so we 
won’t be laughed at.” 

“Nice,” said Ephraim. He hated 
to shatter his partner’s enthusiasm. 
“But aren’t you forgetting some- 
thing? How are we going to get a 
body?” 

“Easy.” Luke weighed his part- 
ner with a professional eye. “We’ll 
oretend that you’ve passed on. 
You’ll make a nice corpse.” 
“You’d make a nicer one.” 
“You’re older than I am and 
better known.” 

“It was my idea in the first 
place,” argued Ephraim. 

“We’ll toss for it,” said Luke. 
Ephraim lost. 

A S a funeral, it was a colossal 
success. Even Ephraim had 
to admit that. He’d felt a little 
peeved at Luke having all the 
fun, but he’d been allowed to 
choose his own casket and the 
floral tributes were spectacularly 
lavish. There had been twenty 
mutes and ten bearers, the high 
school band had given fair treat- 
ment to the “March” from Saul, 
and everyone who knew him, had

seen him or who had known some- 
one who had known him had fol- 
lowed the casket in a determined 
effort to get into the act. 

Death was so rare as to create 
headlines and Luke, by virtue of a 
third cousin connected with ad- 
vertising, had done a good job on 
the publicity. Every hotel in town 
had been booked solid. Every 
house with a spare bedroom had 
coined money. TV had covered 
the event on a worldwide network 
and even a delegation of Rigelians, 
’'-^egans and other assorted mem- 
bers of the Galactic Civilization 
had come to see the fun. 

Centre Forks had had a field 
day. 

“Fifteen orders,” gloated Luke. 
“From Mrs. Homer’s little girl, 
who wants us to inter her favorite 
doll, to Fred Easterby, who wants 
us to plant his app>endix. He’s got 
it in a jar for some reason and 
now he wants it given decent 
burial.” 

“Now wait a minute.” Ephraim 
rubbed his sore cheeks. He’d fol- 
lowed the cortage hidden behind 
false whiskers and he was allergic 
to the stuff. “Since when have we 
fallen so low that we’ve begun 
burying dolls?” 

“Since we got the order.” Luke 
busied himself with pencil and 
paper. “Now let me see. We’ve 
got a plank of walnut that would 
do for the casket and there’s some 
of that white plush left over—” 



T¥E added figures, doubled the 
amount, looked at it sidewise 
and then rounded off the figure. 
“We’ll have to disinter the doll 
afterward, of course, but I’ve al- 
lowed for that.” 

“I don’t get it,” said Ephraim. 
“That ceremony out there was to 
symbolically bury the profession. 
A clean, decent ending to an hon- 
ored trade. Now you’re talking 
about pandering to a rich kid’s 
whim. I thought we’d quit.” 

“That was before we got the 
orders.” 

“It’s not ethical.” 

“It’s money in the bank,” re- 
minded Luke. 

“Money isn’t everything,” said 
Ephraim piously. “I refuse to 
prostitute my art.” 

“You’ve already done that. Re- 
member Mrs. Chadwell’s dog?” 
“That was a living thing which 
had passed to its rest,” said Eph- 
raim. “Such interments were recog- 
nized by the profession before 
Sigk Gesligk stabbed us in the 
back. Dolls are different.” 

“Why?” 

“It’s mockery, that’s why.” 

“You can’t mock what doesn’t 
exist.” Luke threw down his pen- 
cil and tilted his chair. “Now you 
tell me — how else can we stay 
solvent? It’s no good waiting for 
natural business. There isn’t any. 
People don’t die any more and, 
as far as the world goes, we’re as 
extinct as the dodo. While you’re 



70

on the subject, perhaps you’ll tell 
me the difference between interr- 
ing a doll and burying an empty 
casket.” 

“You’ve changed,” said Ephraim 
sadly. “Success has gone to your 
head. A few weeks ago, you 
wouldn’t have talked like this. 
Doesn’t tradition mean anything 
to you?” 

“Sure it does,” Luke replied 
easily. “But I like to eat too.” 

“But we’ve quit. We’re out of 
business.” 

“Fifteen orders says different,” 
grinned Luke. “I’ve changed my 
mind.” 

He lost the grin as trouble, un- 
announced, unsuspected and en- 
tirely unwanted, joined the party. 

Its name was Augustus Blake 
and it came directly from the 
government. 

ISGRACE,” said Ephraim. 

“Trial, sentence, the works. 
I wish I were dead.” 

Luke refrained from the obvious 
comment. If Ephraim were dead, 
then neither of them would have 
had to face the prosecution Blake 
had instigated. 

“Conspiring to falsify the pub- 
lic records,” groaned Ephraim. 
“Creating a public mischief by ar- 
ranging for a fraudulent interment. 
Acquiring money under false pre- 
tenses by the sale of floral tributes. 
Spreading alarm and despondency 
by the rumored failure of the im- 



mortality treatment. Treasonable 
conduct in that we created strained 
relations between the government 
and the Rigelian Ambassador.” He 
stared hollowly at his partner. 
“Did we really do all that?” 

“The judge said we did.” Even 
the prospect of fifteen interments 
couldn’t cheer Luke up now. He 
ran a trembling hand through his 
hair. “The way he talked to us, 
as if we were criminals! He said 
he was doing us a favor by impos- 
ing a heavy fine instead of send- 
ing us to jail.” 

“Unless we pay up, we’ll go 
there anyway,” said Ephraim. 

“I know.” Luke scowled as the 
doorbell sent echoes through the 
house. “More trouble. I’ll bet. That 
or some smart-aleck kid asking 
after your health. You’d think 
some people would get tired of 
beating a corny old joke to death.” 

He rose and went grumbling to 
the door. Ephraim, sitting at the 
table, heard the mumble of voices 
and the sound of many feet. He 
looked up as Luke returned. He 
wasn’t alone. A Rigelian was with 
him, a tall, scaled, humanoid shape 
carrying the inevitable sound- 
vision recorder hanging from a 
strap around its neck. 

A tourist, thought Ephraim sour- 
ly- 

“Meet Gel Rangk,” Luke intro- 
duced. “Mr. Rangk, this is the 
famous Ephraim Fingle of whom 
you may have heard.” 



LAST OF THE MORTICIANS

“I attended your most interest- 
ing trial,” hissed the Rigelian. He 
spoke English as if he had a steam 
engine instead of vocal cords. 
“Very interesting example of primi- 
tive operation of arbitrary justice.” 
He touched the box hanging 
around his neck. “Have full record 
for later editing and dissemina- 
tion to those interested in pur- 
chasing copies of same.” 

“How nice for you.” Ephraim 
couldn’t forget that it was this 
race which had reduced him to his 
present position. 

“Regret exceedingly that I 
missed opportunity of recording 
the ceremony which was the cause 
of your unfortunate predicament,” 
continued the Rigelian. “Such 
record would be highly salable to 
those with interest in quaint burial 
customs of primitive planets. Is 
ceremony repeatable?” 

“No,” said Ephraim. 

“Perhaps,” said Luke. 

“No,” repeated Ephraim. “Not 
on your life.” 

“Will pay,” said Gel Rangk. 

Ephraim changed his mind. 

¥ T was a chilling day in late fall, 
and Centre Forks, Pop. 17,106, 
was about to enter the last per- 



formance of the season. Ephraim 
Fingle, resplendent in full mourn- 
ing dress, ran a critical eye over 
the assembled mutes, bearers, 
mourners and band, ^^uke joined 
him just before deadline. He had 
a Miami tan and glowed with pros- 
perity. He raised his eyebrows at 
the casket. 

“What’s it this time?” he in- 
quired briskly. 

“Granny Hilton’s bedroom slip- 
pers. She won the raffle. She was 
about to discard them anyway, so 
she said they’d earned a decent 
burial.” 

“They’ll do as well as anjrthing.” 
Luke scowled at one of the mutes. 
“Get that grin off your face. You’re 
paid to look like one of the be- 
reaved, not a clown.” He lost his 
scowl as the band swung into the 
“Death March” from Saul. 

Ephraim looked self-conscious. 
“They like it,” he explained. “Rid- 
ing in the hearse?” 

“Why not?” Luke climbed 
aboard, Ephraim at his side, and 
both men smoothed thejr faces as 
the procession swung into Main 
Street between the lines of ranked 
aliens and their busily whirring 
recorders.

BY WILLY LEY 

THE ACCIDENT 
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN 

S OME time ago I came across 
a very interesting docu- 
ment, interesting for more 
than one reason. In physical shape, 
it is a typescript of an article, only 
three and a half pages long, written 
about 1910. It must have been 
printed somewhere, because on the 
first page there are some penciled 
notes as to type size and so forth, 
but I don’t know where it was pub- 
lished. The last page bears the au- 
thor’s signature: Hudson Maxim. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



73 




Before I go on, I had better ex- 
plain just who Hudson Maxim was. 
The mention of the name of 
Maxim brings to mind the Maxim 
gun, but its inventor was Sir Hiram 
Stevens Maxim, who died in 1916. 
If the name made you think of the 
Maxim silencer, you were one gen- 
eration closer to the present, for 
the silencer was invented by Sir 
Hiram’s son, Hiram Percy Maxim, 
who died in 1936. The Hudson 
Maxim who wrote the article I am 
going to discuss was Sir Hiram’s 
younger brother (died in 1927) 
who founded the Columbia Pow- 
der Company and then the Maxim 
Powder Company — finally sold 
to E. I. Dupont de Nemours — and 
invented the explosive called max- 
imite. 

Having the “who’s who” straight- 
ened out, we can proceed to the 
piece itself. It opens with the fol- 
lowing sentence: “The enormous 
energy developed by the combus- 
tion of high explosives and smoke- 
less powders has led many to con- 
clude that such materials could be 
utilized to advantage in some form 
of internal combustion engine es- 
pecially designed for the purpose.” 

This sounds like a fairly innocu- 
ous beginning, and when I read it, 
I felt sure what the argument in 
the next paragraph would be. To 
my surprise, the argument I ex- 
pected was not developed. Hudson 
Maxim, a few lines later, pointed 
out that a “smokeless powder com- 



bines within itself both the fuel 
and the oxygen for its own com- 
bustion; hence, it is a fuel in which 
the combustible is chemically com- 
bined with oxygen, and is conse- 
quently a much more expensive 
fuel than gasoline or anything now 
used in internal combustion en- 
gines.” The line of reasoning is 
this: “The oxygen contained in an 
explosive cannot be compared in 
cheapness with atmospheric oxy- 
gen, which does not cost anything.” 

All true, of course, but I would 
have expected that one of the fore- 
most authorities on high explosives 
would have pointed out something 
different. The main argument is 
that a smokeless powder or a high 
explosive does not contain more 
energy than ordinary engine fuels. 
Most likely this simply had not yet 
been measured in 1910, strange as 
it may seem in retrospect. 

rOR a good comparison of the 
energy content of various fuels, 
the exhaust velocity (theoretical) 
when used in a rocket is a fine 
yardstick. Now if you compare 
these theoretical exhaust velocities, 
you get the following somewhat un- 
expected list: 

Dynamite (if it could be used 
in a rocket motor) has a theoreti- 
cal exhaust velocity of almost pre- 
cisely 11,000 feet per second. 
Smokeless powder, such as used in 
artillery cartridges, produces a 
theoretical exhaust velocity of 



74 



GALAXY 



10,500 feet per second. Ordinary 
ethyl alcohol, burned with pure 
oxygen, has a theoretical exhaust 
velocity of around 13,700 feet per 
second. Gasoline, burned with pure 
oxygen, has one of about 14,500 
feet per second, and even aniline 
burned with nitric acid proves 
superior to dynamite, with a theo- 
retical exhaust velocity of 11,800 
feet per second. 

Hudson Maxim, instead of re- 
futing the widespread misunder- 
standing that “dynamite is more 
powerful than anything,” was talk- 
ing in terms of money. It would be 
too expensive to run a car or an 
airplane on smokeless powder is 
his main talking point. 

He emphasized that he was not 
just calculating costs. “I have con- 
ducted more experiments in the 
use of explosive materials for driv- 
ing motors than any man living or 
dead. I have spent more than six- 
ty thousand dollars in these experi- 
ments.” 

His purpwse in making all these 
experiments and in spending all 
that money was to find a superior 
system of propulsion for naval tor- 
pedoes and, possibly, small torpedo 
boats. He pointed out that a naval 
torpedo is in itself an expensive 
item (the price he quoted was 
$5,000) and that its purpose is to 
destroy an even more expensive 
enemy vessel. “It therefore matters 
little whether or not the propelling 
means or motive fluid for the run 



costs fifty dollars instead of five 
dollars; but it would make a lot of 
difference in the economy of run- 
ning an automobile or an aero- 
plane.” 

The main surprise came when I 
learned in which way Hudson 
Maxim used his high explosive for 
driving a naval torpedo. I had best 
stick to straight quotation now: 

“In my system of driving tor- 
pedoes, I employ a material called 
motorite, consisting of seventy per 
cent nitro-glycerin and thirty per 
cent guncotton. In the form in 
which it is used it is no longer ex- 
plosive, but burns continuously 
without explosion. 

“Bars of the material seven 
inches in diameter and five feet 
long are forced into steel tubes. 
These tubes are closed at one end 
and the other end screws into a 
combustion chamber. Water is 
forced into the combustion cham- 
ber instantly upon ignition of the 
exposed end of the motorite in the 
combustion chamber. 

“Under three hundred pwunds 
pressure to the square inch, motor- 
ite burns at the rate of a foot per 
minute. The flame blast of the 
burning motorite atomizes the 
water by passing with the water 
through a tube in which baffle 
plates are placed at intervals. The 
products of combustion and steam 
together are utilized to drive a tur- 
bine or reciprocating engine, pref- 
erably a turbine ... A pound of 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



75 



motorite will evaporate about two 
pounds of water, so that each pound 
of motorite consumed represents 
three pounds of mixed steam and 
products of combustion.” 

1 KNOW, of course, what this 
suggests. If you have a bar of 
a double-base powder, 7 inches in 
diameter and 5 feet long, you don’t 
use it to boil water to get steam to 
drive a turbine, which then drives 
a propeller. You take your bar of 
double-base powder and suspend it 
inside a tube in such a manner that 
it burns as rapidly as possible and 
you have a nice solid-fuel missile 
of reasonable size. 

Reading the description of the 
utilization — provided that’s the 
word to use at this point— of motor- 
ite strikes one as a very close miss. 
One little accident of the right kind 
would have opwned his eyes. The 
miss is even closer when you read 
the concluding paragraph, which 
starts out thus: “I once suggested 
the use of motorite in small sticks 
for driving model aeroplanes in 
short trial flights. For such use 
the material would be cheap 
enough . .” 

I can’t resist quoting one more 
paragraph from the article: 

“The cost of driving an engine 
by means of motorite would be 
about two dollars per horsepower 
hour. Therefore, in order to drive 
a hundred horsepower automobile 
with motorite it would cost, for fuel 



alone, two hundred dollars an hour, 
and the motorite would make a 
heavy load for the car, as it would 
require the consumption of nearly 
a ton of motorite per hour. There- 
fore, if a hundred horsepower aero- 
plane were to use motorite for a 
fuel, it would be unable to carry 
enough for an hour’s flight.” 

When Hudson Maxim died in 
1927, he was 74 years old. Conceiv- 
ably he could have lived for an- 
other twenty years. If he had, he 
would have seen what he missed 
back in 1910, just because of the 
accident that didn’t happen — and 
that would have changed history 
if it had. 

THE MYSTERY PLANT 
FROM KYRENE 

^^NCE upon a time there was a 

plant which Greek-speaking 
traders called Zilphion. To quiet 
objections or questions which Basil 
Davenport or Rosel George Brown 
are likely to raise at this point, I 
have to explain that the first letter, 
if you write it in the Greek original, 
is a sigma, which is normally tran- 
scribed as an “s” rather than a “z.” 
But all my teachers were in unani- 
mous agreement that the pronun- 
ciation of the Greek sigma was that 
of the English “z,” so why not use 
it? 

Well, to go on, if you should hap- 
pen to have a hoard of old coins 
and among them is one of the two

Two different Didrachmai pieces from clas- 
sical Cyrene, showing the unknown plant 
Zylphlon. The actual size of these coins Is 
about the same as a quarter. 




didrachmai pieces from Kyrene 
(or Cyrene) pictured here, you not 
only have a valuable collector’s 
item, but also a botanical mystery 
on your hands. For this zilphion 
plant is the only example of a plant 
which became extinct within his- 
torical times that I know of. 



Of animals which became ex- 
tinct in historical times, we have 
a deplorably long list, ranging from 
a case like Rhytina {gigas) stetleri, 
or Steller’s seacow, of which only 
a few hundred specimens existed 
when it was discovered, to Ecto- 
pistes migratorius, the passenger 
pigeon which in Audubon’s times 
flew over the North American con- 
tinent in uncountable millions. But 
nobody ever heard of a plant that 
flourished in the days of the early 
civilizations and is now complete- 
ly unknown — with the exception of 
this zilphion. 

What makes the mystery so as- 
tonishing is that zilphion was an 
article of trade that made several 
cities rich. The fact alone that it 
was put on coins indicates that it 
was valuable, and there existed an 
idiomatic phrase meaning “more 
valuable than zilphion.” We even 
have a classical picture of the zil- 
phion trade. It is a shallow bowl 
made around 600 b.c. and found 
in Italy. Because the main figure in 
the picture is the ruler Arkesilas 
III, the bowl is known as the Ar- 
kesilas bowl to historians. 

The picture shows the king 
seated under a sun sail, aboard a 
ship, surrounded by servants who 
are all carefully labeled. In the 
ship’s bottom, two men stow large 
bags under the supervision of some- 
body labeled phylakos (overseer), 
while five men are on deck with 
the ruler. One is labeled eirmo- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



77 



pharos (porter), another isophortos 
(in this context, this term is best 
translated as supervisor) and a 
third one zilphiomapsos, the “zil- 
phion-kneader.” And somewhere 
on the bowl is the exclamation 
oryxon (“Go away!”) for reasons 
unknown to me or anybody else. 

As the picture on the oval 
didrachma shows, the plant had a 
thick and probably creeping root 
and a thick stem. Both the Greeks 
and the Romans liked the young 
zilphion sprouts as a vegetable, and 
the stem was eaten too. The taste 
must have been quite pronounced, 
because zilphion was used to flavor 
other dishes. The sap of the stem 
and the root was condensed into 
a kind of syrup which had a special 
Latin name (laserpitium) and an 
easy-to-remember value: If you 
wanted a pound of laserpitium, you 
handed over a pound of silver 
coins. 

^ ILPHION came from North 
^ Africa and the people who 
grew rich ferrying it across the 
Mediterranean Sea claimed that it 
could not be cultivated. It grew in 
certain places in the interior and 
had to be gathered when in season. 
Pliny the Elder, in Book V, Chap- 
ter 5, of his Natural History, stated 
that “The territory of Cyrene, to 
a distance of fifteen miles from the 
shore, is said to abound in trees, 
while for the same distance beyond 
that district it is only suitable for 



the production of grain: after 

which a tract of land, thirty miles 
in breadth and 250 miles in length, 
is productive of nothing but laser 
(zilphion).” 

Pliny’s statement clearly im- 
plies that the plant grew wild and 
was not cultivated. But it was in 
Pliny’s time that zilphion began to 
disappear. “The zilphion of Cyrene 
no longer exists,” Pliny stated in 
Book XXII, chapter 48. But he 
went on to tell that some came 
from Syria. Interestingly enough, 
Pliny speaks about zilphion only 
as a medicinal plant. Repeated 
fumigations with the dried root 
made hemorrhoids disappear. The 
mashed root, with wine and oil, 
was good for bruises “and with wax 
for the cure of scrofulous sores.” 
The leaves, taken with aromatic 
white wine immediately after a 
bath, helped women with a dead 
fetus clear out the uterus — but the 
concoction was taken internally, in 
case one wonders how it was sup)- 
posed to work. 

Three centuries after Pliny, the 
plant zilphion was unknown. 

Anybody who wanted to could 
— and can even now — read the 
descriptions of the plant as given 
by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Co- 
lumella and other classical writers. 
It does not help much, even though 
the descriptions and the pictures 
on the coins agree nicely. Early in 
the nineteenth century, French 
botanists thought that zilphion was 



78 



GALAXY 



probably the plant listed as Thap- 
sia garganica, but the German 
pharmacologist Schroff showed as 
long ago as 1862 that the classical 
authors mentioned had described 
that plant separately. Obviously it 
was not the same as zilphion. 

Another guess was that zilphion 
might have been a local name for 
the plant Ferula asaioetida. But 
that one, as its scientific name indi- 
cates, has an unpleasant smell, and 
nobody in his right mind would use 
it as a flavoring. Besides, it did not 
grow in North Africa but farther 
East, mainly in Persia. 

Difficult as it is, we have to ac- 
cept zilphion as extinct. And we’ll 
never know just what kind of vege- 
table it made on the tables of well- 
to-do Greeks of antiquity.

What I did not know until I 
came across a reference quite re- 
cently is that these three shared a 
secret which they never divulged 



to anybody. And it was a vital 
secret that greatly influenced the 
new art of printing. 

The story of the invention itself 
is reasonably simple. The “inven- 
tor” (I still have to use quotation 
marks for a short time to come ) of 
printing was born in or about 1400 
in the German city of Mainz. His 
real name was Johann Gensfleisch, 
which in German unfortunately 
means “roast goose.” Understand- 
ably, Johann took his mother’s 
maiden name, Gutenberg. Now the 
fact is that there was printing of 
some kind before Gutenberg; his 
real invention consisted in having 
movable separate letters that 
could be put together in any man- 
ner desired. He began to experi- 
ment with his idea around 1439, 
and some seven years later he 
moved back to his native city and 
settled there to exploit his inven- 
tion. 

Being short of money, Guten- 
berg had to form a partnership with 
the goldsmith Johann Fust. Peter 
Schoeffer somehow joined the 
partnership and they went to work. 
The printing press was one prob- 
lem that was not too hard to solve, 
for presses of various types existed. 
Next came the question of making 
the type. Peter Schoeffer sug- 
gested casting it instead of cutting 
the type by hand. He seems to have 
been the one to make copper 
forms for casting. 

So far, so good, but what metal

was to be used for the tj^je? Tin 
was likely to break under pres- 
sure. Lead was too soft They tried 
a mixture of tin and lead, which 
looked all right at first glance, 
it being neither too brittle nor 
too soft — under ordinary circum- 
stances. In the press, though, it 
still had the tendency to be 
squashed. It lasted for a few im- 
pressions, but not long enough. 

Then one of the three thought 
of a “secret ingredient,” just as soap 
manufacturers and toothpaste 
makers still do. Peter Schoeffer 
later claimed loud and often that 
he had been the man who thought 
of the ingredient, and that it was 
his idea that made printing pos- 
sible at all. 

But he never said what the in- 
gredient was. 

¥ T was Professor' Edmund O. von 
-*• Lippmann who, about thirty 
years ago, could show that the 
secret ingredient must have been 
bismuth. 

It is impossible to say just when 
bismuth became known. Professor 
von Lippmann could show that all 
the suspected mentions of bismuth 
prior to 1400 a.d. referred to other 
things. On the other hand, miners 
must have come across bismuth 
before that time. But even much 
later, the miners were not con- 
vinced that bismuth was a metal 
in its own right. 

As late as the early seventeenth 



century, most miners were con- 
vinced that there were three kinds 
of lead (no, they did not think in 
terms of isotopes as we are likely 
to do nowadays), namely lead and 
the metal called stannum (tin) and 
Wismat (“white matter,” our bis- 
muth). The miners also thought 
that tin was a little more similar to 
silver than lead, and that bismuth 
was even closer to silver. It is re- 
ported that miners sometimes, 
when they found bismuth, com- 
plained that they had come too 
early; if they had come a century 
or two later, they would have found 
silver instead. Often, however, they 
had the consolation that silver 
could be found below the bismuth, 
and for that reason bismuth was 
called tectum argenti or “roof of 
silver.” 

Well, whether the miners thought 
bismuth was a kind of lead or not, 
the fact is that nobody was inter- 
ested in bismuth prior to about 
1450 and that there was a demand 
for it afterward. Professor von 
Lippmann was convinced that 
Schoeffer’s secret ingredient was 
bismuth. In the first place, it would 
do what was needed: make the 
type metal harder. In the second 
place, at a somewhat later date 
(1495), the German printer 
Huerus, who was one of the first 
printers in Spain, had a German 
merchant send him “77 pounds of 
Wismat” for which he could not 
possibly have any use except as 



80

ANY QUESTIONS'? 



an additive to the lead and tin in 
his t3T>e metal. 

Moreover, Peter Schoeffer did 
not even have to experiment at ran- 
dom to get the idea that bismuth 
might do what the first printers 
needed. In those days, many uten- 
sils were made of tin: tin spoons, 
tin cups, tin plates. The tin casters 
knew that “Wismat” improved 
their wares, making them harder 
and more shiny. In all probability 
the tin casters had found this out 
by accident, by using tin which 
contained bismuth. The fact is that 
at a somewhat later date they 
added bismuth on purpose, but 
their demand for the metal was 
minor, since the bismuth addition 
to the tin amounted to only about 
three per cent. 

Peter Schoeffer might easily 
have known that a small addition 
of the otherwise rather useless 
metal made tin wares harder, and 
might have tried to mix the lead 
for his type metal with this “hard 
tin.” The addition of bismuth must 
have been Gutenberg’s and Schoef- 
fer’s secret. Since none of the orig- 
inal type survived, we naturally 
cannot analyze it. But before the 
invention of printing, nobody cared 
about bismuth, whereas after the 
invention of printing there was a 
sudden demand for it 

And miners started looking for 
tectum argenti, even though they 
themselves would have preferred 
to find silver directly. 



]%/■' Y piece about the Atlantic 
Missile Range in the April 
1959 Galaxy brought some cor- 
resp)ondence which was united on 
one point. And that point was: 
“What other rocket ranges are 
there?” The phrasing of that ques- 
tion was somewhat different in dif- 
ferent letters, of course; some read- 
ers specifically wanted to know 
about the Russian rocket ranges, 
while others asked whether any- 
body but the United States and 
Russia had such firing ranges. 

Well, let me give as complete 
an answer as is possible at this 
moment. First, however, I have to 
point out that I am going to talk 
about missile and rocket ranges, as 
distinct from missile sites. I do not 
know how many missile sites we 
have in the United States and I 
certainly do not know how many 
the Russians have. 

As for the rocket ranges, I would 
say that there are four major ones 
in the United States. There is the 
White Sands Proving Ground, 
which was the first. Then the Atlan- 
tic Missile Range in Florida. 
Then there is Wallops’ Island off 
Virginia, which is less well known 
to the public because none of the 
spectacular big missiles is fired 
from there. Wallops’ Island spe- 
cializes in scientific experiments, 
all of them very valuable scientif- 
ically, but often of such a nature 
that it would take a whole article 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



81 



just to explain why this particular 
experiment was made, and why it 
was made in that specific fashion. 
The fourth range in the United 
States is Vandenberg Air Force 
Base in California, part of which is 
known to many former GIs as 
Camp Cooke. 

It is fairly easy to outline the 
distinguishing features of each. 
Wallops’ Island, as stated, special- 
izes in scientific experiments using 
comparatively small rockets, al- 
most exclusively solid-fuel jobs. 
White Sands fires military missiles 
smaller than Intermediate Range 
Ballistic Missiles. The Atlantic 
Missile Range fires anything ex- 
perimental which needs exception- 
ally careful tracking. And Van- 
denberg AFB in California is for 
the training of missile troops. 

As is usual, even the nicest 
planning runs into a snag of some 
kind where an exception has to be 
made. All satellite shots should go 
to Cape Canaveral, and they do — 
unless the satellite is to be placed 
into an orbit that goes over both 
poles. That can’t be done from 
Florida. From Canaveral you 
shoot over the Bahamas, which 
means to the southeast. If you are 
willing and able to sacrifice some 
tracking, you can also shoot north- 
east. But you can’t shoot due south 
or due north. If you tried to shoot 
due north, the first stage might 
fall unpleasantly close to Savan- 
nah, Georgia. If you tried to shoot 



due south, you might get a first 
stage impact near Matanzas, Cuba. 

From California, you also can- 
not shoot due north because there 
are too many cities in that direc- 
tion. But if you shoot due south, 
the next land under the rocket will 
be Antarctica. Hence polar orbit 
shots have to be fired from Van- 
denberg, which normally special- 
izes in troop training. 

Now we get to rocket ranges 
elsewhere in the world. 

NE of the oldest is the Austral- 
ian range, with its firing site 
in South Central Australia. If you 
look at a map of Australia, you see, 
somewhat off center of the south 
shore, a deep inlet called Spencer’s 
Gulf, at the head of which is Port 
Augusta. To the north of Port 
Augusta, not shown on most maps, 
is a mountain range called the 
Woomera Mountains. Woomera is 
the firing site, and the missiles fly 
to the northwest across uninhabited 
deserts. The distance to the shore 
from Woomera is around 1200 
miles. 

But in the same direction, if you 
continue for another 1500 miles, 
there is a British-owned place 
named Christmas Island. The 
Woomera range, therefore, permits 
shots up to about 2700 miles. The 
drawback is that the largest firing 
range of the British Empire is 
12,000 miles from Great Britain. 
For this reason, they have a few 



82 



GALAXY 



small firing ranges for small rockets 
“at home” — one at Aberporth in 
Wales, and one at Solway Firth in 
Scotland, with one more, utilizing 
the Hebrides Islands, under con- 
struction. 

The French also have a poten- 
tial large firing range, much closer 
to their homeland than the English 
have. This is in the Algerian Sahara 
at Colomb-Bechar, while the in- 
tended target area is Lake Chad, 
about 1500 miles away. 

Germany does not seem to have 
an active firing range, unless there 
is something we don’t know about. 
The first rocket firing range of all 
was the German army’s Peene- 
miinde establishment on the island 
of Usedom, north of the city and 
harbor of Stettin. They fired in a 
generally easterly direction, along 
the shoreline of the Baltic Sea. In 
the course of the war, Peenemiinde 
was heavily battered, and when 
the Russians finally took it after 
prolonged artillery preparation, 
they claimed that it was three- 
quarters destroyed. Then, they 
said, they dynamited what was still 
standing. 

That area is now Polish. And the 
rumors say that the Russians have 
reactivated Peenemiinde. I can’t 
quite believe that myself, but the 
stories persist. However, if they 
fired anything of any size from 
Peenemiinde, it would surely have 
been detected. So let us leave 
Peenemiinde open as a doubtful 



case, even though I personally am 
not convinced. 

"P ROCEEDING to the Russian 
^ rocket ranges, there is one we 
know about. It is Kapustin Yar, 
almost precisely fifty miles due 
east of Stalingrad and north of the 
Caspian Sea. Kapustin Yar was 
started in 1946, as far as we know. 
I am phrasing this carefully be- 
cause we don’t know where the 
Russians carried on their rocket 
experiments before World War II. 
In 1936, remember, they had the 
high-altitude record for rockets 
with a shot to about six miles, when 
nobody else had yet reached two 
miles. This shot may have been 
made from Kapustin Yar. 

At any event, they can shoot in 
any direction, except to the west, 
from Kapustin Yar. There are 
deserts to the north and to the east, 
and the Caspian Sea to the south. 
In fact, it was thought at first that 
both Sputnik I and Sputnik II were 
fired from Kapustin Yar, but a 
Japanese astronomer, carefully 
going over the orbits of the first two 
artificial satellites, decided that 
Kapustin Yar had about the right 
latitude for these shots, but not the 
right longitude. He came to the 
conclusion that there had to be 
another Russian firing range far- 
ther east, in the Kyzyl Kum Desert. 

And that is as far as our knowl- 
edge goes right now.

O LD Mose Abrams was out 
hunting cows when he 
found the alien. He didn’t 
know it was an alien, but it was 
alive and it was in a lot of trouble 
and Old Mose, despite everything 
the neighbors said about him, was 
not the kind of man who could bear 
to leave a sick thing out there in 
the woods. 

It was a horrid-looking thing, 
green and shiny, with some purple 
spots on it, and it was repulsive 
even twenty feet away. And it 
stank. 

It had crawled, or tried to crawl, 
into a clump of hazel brush, but 
hadn’t made it. The head part was 
in the brush and the rest lay out 
there naked in the open. Every 
now and then the parts that seemed 
to be arms and hands clawed feebly 
at the ground, trying to force itself 
deeper in the brush, but it was too 
weak; it never moved an inch. 

It was groaning, too, but not too 
loud — just the kind of keening 
sound a lonesome wind might make 
around a wide, deep eave. But 
there was more in it than just the 
sound of winter wind; there was 
a frightened, desperate note that 
made the hair stand up on Old 
Mose’s nape. 

Old Mose stood there for quite 
a spell, making up his mind what 
he ought to do about it, and a 
while longer after that working up 
his courage, although most folks 
offhand would have said that he 



85 



had plenty. But this was the sort 
of situation that took more than 
just ordinary screwed-up courage. 
It took a lot of foolhardiness. 

But this was a wild, hurt thing 
and he couldn’t leave it there, so 
he walked up to it and knelt down, 
and it was pretty hard to look at, 
though there was a sort of fascina- 
tion in its repulsiveness that was 
hard to figure out — as if it were 
so horrible that it dragged one to 
it. And it stank in a way that no 
one had ever smelled before. 

Mose, however, was not finicky. 
In the neighborhood, he was not 
well known for fastidity. Ever since 
his wife had died almost ten years 
before, he had lived alone on his 
untidy farm and the housekeeping 
that he did was the scandal of all 
the neighbor women. Once a year, 
if he got around to it, he sort of 
shoveled out the house, but the 
rest of the year he just let things 
accumulate. 

So he wasn’t as upset as some 
might have been with the way the 
creature smelled. But the sight of 
it upset him, and it took him quite 
a while before he could bring him- 
self to touch it, and when he finally 
did, he was considerably surprised. 
He had been prepared for it to be 
either cold or slimy, or maybe even 
both. But it was neither. It was 
warm and hard and it had a clean 
feel to it, and he was reminded of 
the way a green corn stalk would 
feel. 



XI E slid his hand beneath the 
hurt thing and pulled it gently 
from the clump of hazel brush and 
turned it over so he could see its 
face. It hadn’t any face. It had an 
enlargement at the top of it, like a 
flower on top of a stalk, although 
its body wasn’t any stalk, and there 
was a fringe around this enlarge- 
ment that wiggled like a can of 
worms, and it was then that Mose 
almost turned around and ran. 

But he stuck it out. 

He squatted there, staring at the 
no-face with the fringe of worms, 
and he got cold all over and his 
stomach doubled up on him and he 
was stiff with fright — and the fright 
got worse when it seemed to him 
that the keening of the thing was 
coming from the worms. 

Mose was a stubborn man. One 
had to be stubborn to run a runty 
farm like his. Stubborn and insensi- 
tive in a lot of ways. But not in- 
sensitive, of course, to a thing in 
pain. 

Finally he was able to pick it 
up and hold it in his arms and there 
was nothing to it, for it didn’t weigh 
much. Less than a half-grown 
shoat, he figured. 

He went up the woods path with 
it, heading back for home, and it 
seemed to him the smell of it was 
less. He was hardly scared at all 
and he was warm again and not 
cold all over. 

For the thing was quieter now 
and keening just a little. And al- 



86 



GALAXY 



though he could not be sure of it, 
there were times when it seemed 
as if the thing were snuggling up 
to him, the way a scared and hungry 
baby will snuggle to any grown per- 
son that comes and picks it up. 

Old Mose reached the buildings 
and he stood out in the yard a 
minute, wondering whether he 
should take it to the bam or house. 
The barn, of course, was the na- 
tural place for it, for it wasn’t hu- 
man — it wasn’t even as close to 
human as a dog or cat or sick lamb 
would be. 

He didn’t hesitate too long, 
however. He took it into the house 
and laid it on what he called a bed, 
next to the kitchen stove. He got it 
straightened out all neat and order- 
ly and pulled a dirty blanket over 
it, and then went to the stove and 
stirred up the fire until there was 
some flame. 

Then he pulled up a chair beside 
the bed and had a good, hard, won- 
dering look at this thing he had 
brought home. It had quieted down 
a lot and seemed more comfortable 
than it had out in the woods. He 
tucked the blanket snug around it 
with a tenderness that surprised 
himself. He wondered what he had 
that it might eat, and even if he 
knew, how he’d manage feeding it, 
for it seemed to have no mouth. 

“But you don’t need to worry 
none,” he told it. “Now that I got 
you under a roof, you’ll be all right. 
I don’t know too much about it, but 



I’ll take care of you the best I can.” 

By now it was getting on toward 
evening, and he looked out the win- 
dow and saw that the cows he had 
been hunting had come home by 
themselves. 

“I got to go get the milking done 
and the other chores,” he told the 
thing lying on the bed, “but it won’t 
take me long. I’ll be right back.” 

LD Mose loaded up the stove 
so the kitchen would stay 
warm and he tucked the thing in 
once again, then got his milk pails 
and went down to the barn. 

He fed the sheep and pigs and 
horses and he milked the cows. He 
hunted eggs and shut the chicken 
house. He pumped a tank of water. 

Then he went back to the house. 

It was dark now and he lit the 
oil lamp on the table, for he was 
against electricity. He’d refused to 
sign up when REA had run out 
the line and a lot of the neighbors 
had gotten sore at him for being 
uncooperative. Not that he cared,, 
of course. 

He had a look at the thing upon 
the bed. It didn’t seem to be any 
better, or any worse, for that mat- 
ter. If it had been a sick lamb or 
an ailing calf, he could have known 
right off how it was getting on, but 
this thing was different. There was 
no way to tell. 

He fixed himself some supper 
and ate it and wished he knew how 
to feed the thing. And he wished. 



A DEATH IN THE HOUSE 



87 



too, that he knew how to help it. 
He’d got it under shelter and he 
had it warm, but was that right or 
wrong for something like this? He 
had no idea. 

He wondered if he should try 
to get some help, then felt squeam- 
ish about asking help when he 
couldn’t say exactly what had to be 
helped. But then he wondered how 
he would feel himself if he were in 
a far, strange country, all played 
out and sick, and no one to get 
him any help because they didn’t 
know exactly what he was. 

That made up his mind for him 
and he walked over to the phone. 
But should be call a doctor or a 
veterinarian? He decided to call 
the doctor because the thing was in 
the house. If it had been in the 
barn, he would have called the vet- 
erinarian. 

He was on a rural- line and the 
hearing wasn’t good and he was 
halfway deaf, so he didn’t use the 
phone too often. He had told him- 
self at times it was nothing but 
another aggravation and there had 
been a dozen times he had threat- 
ened to have it taken out. But now 
he was glad he hadn’t. 

The operator got old Doctor 
Benson and they couldn’t hear one 
another too well, but Mose finally 
made the doctor understand who 
was calling and that he needed him 
and the doctor said he’d come. 

With some relief, Mose hung up 
the phone and was just standing 

88 



there, not doing anything, when he 
was struck by the thought that 
there might be others of these 
things down there in the woods. He 
had no idea what they were or 
what they might be doing or where 
they might be going, but it was 
pretty evident that the one upon 
the bed was some sort of stranger 
from a very distant place. It stood 
to reason that there might be more 
than one of them, for far traveling 
was a lonely business and anyone 
—or anything— would like to have 
some company along. 

TTE got the lantern down off the 
peg and lit it and went stump- 
ing out the door. The night was as 
black as a stack of cats and the lan- 
tern light was feeble, but that made 
not a bit of difference, for Mose 
knew this farm of his like the back 
of his hand. 

He went down the path into the 
woods. It was a spooky place, but 
it took more than woods at night 
to spwok Old Mose. At the place 
where he had found the thing, he 
looked around, pushing through the 
brush and holding the lantern high 
so he could see a bigger area, but 
he didn’t find another one of them. 

He did find something else, 
though — a sort of outsize birdcage 
made of metal lattice work that 
had wrapped itself around an eight- 
inch hickory tree. He tried to pull 
it loose, but it was jammed so tight 
that he couldn’t budge it. 



GALAXY 



He sighted back the way it must 
have come. He could see where it 
had plowed its way through the up- 
per branches of the trees, and out 
beyond were stars, shining bleak- 
ly with the look of far away. 

Mose had no doubt that the 
thing lying on his bed beside the 
kitchen stove had come in this bird- 
cage contraprtion. He marveled 
some at that, but he didn’t fret him- 
self too much, for the whole thing 
was so unearthly that he knew he 
had little chance of pondering it 
out. 

He walked back to the house and 
he scarcely had the lantern blown 
out and hung back on its peg than 
he heard a car drive up. 

The doctor, when he came up to 
the door, became a little grumpy 
at seeing Old Mose standing there. 

“You don’t look sick to me,” the 
doctor said. “Not sick enough to 
drag me clear out here at night.” 

“I ain’t sick,” said Mose. 

“Well, then,” said the doctor, 
more grumpily than ever, “what 
did you mean by phoning me?” 

“I got someone who is sick,” said 
Mose. “I hoj)e you can help him. 
I would have tried myself, but I 
don’t know how to go about it.” 
The doctor came inside and 
Mose shut the door behind him. 

“You got something rotten in 
here?” asked the doctor. 

“No, it’s just the way he smells. 
It was pretty bad at first, but I’m 
getting used to it by now.” 

A DEATH I N THE HOUSE 



The doctor saw the thing lying 
on the bed and went over to it. Old 
Mose heard him sort of gasp and 
could see him standing there, very 
stiff and straight. Then he bent 
down and had a good look at the 
critter on the bed. 

When he straightened up and 
turned around to Mose, the only 
thing that kept him from being 
downright angry was that he was so 
flabbergasted. 

“Mose,” he yelled, “what is this?” 
“I don’t know,” said Mose. “I 
found it in the woods and it was 
hurt and wailing and I couldn’t 
leave it there.” 

“You think it’s sick?” 

“I know it is,” said Mose. “It 
needs help awful bad. I’m afraid it’s 
dying.” 

T he doctor turned back to the 
bed again and pulled the blan- 
ket down, then went and got the 
lamp so that he could see. He 
looked the critter up and down, 
and he prodded it with a skittish 
finger, and he made the kind of 
mysterious clucking sound that 
only doctors make. 

Then he pulled the blanket back 
over it again and took the lamp 
back to the table. 

“Mose,” he said, “I can’t do a 
thing for it.” 

“But you’re a doctor!” 

“A human doctor, Mose. I don’t 
know what this thing is, but it isn’t 
human. I couldn’t even guess what 

89 



is wrong with it, if anything. And I 
wouldn’t know what could be safe- 
ly done for it even if I could diag- 
nose its illness. I’m not even sure 
it’s an animal. There are a lot of 
things about it that argue it’s a 
plant.” 

Then the doctor asked Mose 
straight out how he came to find it 
and Mose told him exactly how it 
happened. But he didn’t tell him 
anything about the birdcage, for 
when he thought about it, it 
sounded so fantastic that he 
couldn’t bring himself to tell it. Just 
finding the critter and having it 
here was bad enough, without 
throwing in the birdcage. 

“I tell you what,” the doctor 
said. “You got something here 
thaf s outside all human knowledge. 
I doubt there’s ever been a thing 
like this seen on Elarth before. I 
have no idea what it is and I 
wouldn’t try to guess. If I were you, 
I’d get in touch with the university 
up at Madison. There might be 
someone there who could get it 
figured out. Even if they couldn’t 
they’d be interested. They’d want 
to study it.” 

Mose went to the cupboard and 
got the cigar box almost full of sil- 
ver dollars and paid the doctor. 
The doctor put the dollars in his 
pocket, joshing Mose about his ec- 
centricity. 

But Mose was stubborn about his 
silver dollars. “Paper money don’t 
seem legal, somehow,” he declared. 



“I like the feel of silver and the way 
it clinks. It’s got authority.” 

The doctor left and he didn’t 
seem as upset as Mose had been 
afraid he might be. As soon as he 
was gone, Mose pulled up a chair 
and sat down beside the bed. 

It wasn’t right, he thought, that 
the thing should be so sick and no 
one to help — no one who knew any 
way to help it 

He sat in the chair and listened 
to the ticking of the clock, loud in 
the kitchen silence, and the crack- 
ling of the wood burning in the 
stove. 

Looking at the thing lying on 
the bed, he had an almost fierce 
hope that it could get well again 
and stay with him. Now that its 
birdcage was all banged up, maybe 
there’d be nothing it could do but 
stay. And he hoped it would, for 
already the house felt less lonely. 

CITTING in the chair between 
^ the stove and bed, Mose 
realized how lonely it had been. 
It had not been quite so bad until 
Towser died. He had tried to bring 
himself to get another dog, but he 
never had been able to. For there 
was no dog that would take the 
place of Towser and it had seemed 
unfaithful to even try. He could 
have gotten a cat, of course, but 
that would remind him too much of 
Molly; she had been very fond of 
cats, and until the time she died, 
there had always been two or three 



90

of them underfoot around the 
place. 

But now he was alone. Alone 
with his farm and his stubbornness 
and his silver dollars. The doctor 
thought, like all the rest of them, 
that the only silver Mose had was 
in the cigar box in the cupboard. 
There wasn’t one of them who 
knew about the old iron kettle 
piled plumb full of them, hidden 
underneath the floor boards of the 
living room. He chuckled at the 
thought of how he had them fooled. 
He’d give a lot to see his neighbors’ 
faces if they could only know. But 
he was not the one to tell them. If 
they were to find it out, they’d have 
to find it out themselves. 

He nodded in the chair and final- 
ly he slept, sitting upright, with his 
chin resting on his chest and his 
crossed arms wrapped around him- 
self as if to keep him warm. 

When he woke, in the dark be- 
fore the dawn, with the lamp flick- 
ering on the table and the fire in 
the stove burned low, the alien had 
died. 

There was no doubt of death. 
The thing was cold and rigid and 
the husk that was its body was 
rough and drying out — as a corn 
stalk in the field dries out, whip- 
ping in the wind once the grow- 
ing had been ended. 

Mose pulled the blanket up to 
cover it, and although this was 
early to do the chores, he went out 
by lantern light and got them done. 

A DEATH IN THE HOUSE 



After breakfast, he heated water 
and washed his face and shaved, 
and it was the first time in years 
he’d shaved any day but Sunday. 
Then he put on his one good suit 
and slicked down his hair and got 
the old jalopy out of the machine 
shed and drove into town. 

He hunted up Eb Dennison, the 
town clerk, who also was the sec- 
retary of the cemetery association. 

“Eb,” he said, “I want to buy a 
lot.” 

“But you’ve got a lot,” protested 
Eb. 

“That plot,” said Mose, “is a fam- 
ily plot. There’s just room for me 
and Molly.” 

“Well, then,” asked Eb, “why an- 
other one? You have no other 
members of the family.” 

“I found someone in the woods,” 
said Mose. “I took him home and 
he died last night. I plan to bury 
him.” 

“If you found a dead man in 
the woods,” Eb warned him, “you 
better notify the coroner and 
sheriff.” 

“In time I may,” said Mose, not 
intending to. “Now how about that 
plot?” 

Washing his hands of the affair 
entirely, Eb sold him the plot. 

XT AVING bought his plot, Mose 
went to the undertaking es- 
tablishment run by Albert Jones. 

“Al,” he said, “there’s been a 
death out at the house. A stranger 

91 



I found out in the woods. He does- 
n’t seem to have anyone and I aim 
to take care of it.” 

“You got a death certificate?” 
asked Al, who subscribed to none 
of the niceties affected by most 
funeral parlor operators. 

“Well, no, I haven’t.” 

“Was there a doctor in atten- 
dance?” 

“Doc Benson came out last 
night.” 

“He should have made you out 
one. I’ll give him a ring.” 

He phoned Doctor Benson and 
talked with him a while and got 
red around the gills. He finally 
slammed down the phone and 
turned on Mose. 

“I don’t know what you’re try- 
ing to pull off,” he fumed, “but Doc 
tells me this thing of yours isn’t 
even human. I don’t take care of 
dogs or cats or — ” 

“This ain’t no dog or cat.” 

“I don’t care what it is. It’s got 
to be human for me to handle it. 
And don’t go trying to bury it in 
the cemetery, because it’s against 
the law.” 

Considerably discouraged, Mose 
left the undertaking parlor and 
trudged slowly up the hill toward 
the town’s one and only church. 

He found the minister in his 
study working on a sermon. Mose 
sat down in a chair and fumbled 
his battered hat around and around 
in his work-scarred hands. 

“Parson,” he said, “I’ll tell you 



the story from first to last,” and he 
did. He added, “I don’t know what 
it is. I guess no one else does, either. 
But it’s dead and in need of decent 
burial and that’s the least that I 
can do. I can’t bury it in the ceme- 
tery, so I suppose I’ll have to find a 
place for it on the farm. I wonder 
if you could bring yourself to come 
out and say a word or two.” 

The minister gave the matter 
some deep consideration. 

“I’m sorry, Mose,” he said at 
last. “I don’t believe I can. I am 
not sure at all the church would 
approve of it.” 

“This thing may not be human,” 
said Old Mose, “but it is one of 
God’s critters.” 

The minister thought some 
more, and did some wondering out 
loud, but made up his mind finally 
that he couldn’t do it 

So Mose went down the street 
to where his car was waiting and 
drove home, thinking about what 
heels some humans are. 

Back at the farm again, he got 
a pick and shovel and went into 
the garden, and there, in one comef 
of it, he dug a grave. He went out 
to the machine shed to hunt up 
some boards to make the thing a 
casket, but it turned out that he had 
used the last of the lumber to patch 
up the hog pen. 

TVr OSE went to the house and 
dug around in a chest in one 
of the back rooms which had not 



92 



GALAXY 



been used for years, hunting for a 
sheet to use as a winding shroud, 
since there would be no casket. He 
couldn’t find a sheet, but he did 
unearth an old white linen table 
cloth. He figured that would do, 
so he took it to the kitchen. 

He pulled back the blanket and 
looked at the critter lying there in 
death and a sort of lump came into 
his throat at the thought of it — 
how it had died so lonely and so far 
from home without a creature of 
its own to spend its final hours 
with. And naked, too, without a 
stitch of clothing and with no pos- 
session, with not a thing to leave 
behind as a remembrance of itself. 

He spread the table cloth out on 
the floor beside the bed and lifted 
the thing and laid it on the table 
cloth. As he laid it down, he saw 
the pocket in it — if it was a pocket 
— a sort of slitted flap in the center 
of what could be its chest. He ran 
his hand across the pocket area. 
There was a lump inside it. He 
crouched for a long moment beside 
the body, wondering what to do. 

Finally he reached his fingers 
into the flap and took out the thing 
that bulged. It was a ball, a little 
bigger than a tennis ball, made of 
cloudy glass — or, at least, it looked 
like glass. He squatted there, star- 
ing at it, then took it to the window 
for a better look. 

There was nothing strange at all 
about the ball. It was just a cloudy 
ball of glass and it had a rough. 



dead feel about it, just as the body 
had. 

He shook his head and took it 
back and put it where he’d found it 
and wrapped the body securely in 
the cloth. He carried it to the gard- 
en and put it in the grave. Stand- 
ing solemnly at the head of the 
grave, he said a few short words 
aid then shoveled in the dirt. 

He had meant to make a mound 
above the grave and he had intend- 
ed to put up a cross, but at the last 
he didn’t do either one of these. 
There would be snoopers. The 
word would get around and they’d 
be coming out and hunting for the 
spot where he had buried this thing 
he had found out in the woods. So 
there must be no mound to mark 
the place and no cross as well. Per- 
haps it was for the best, he told 
himself, for what could he have 
carved or written on the cross? 

By this time it was well past 
noon and he was getting hungry, 
but he didn’t stop to eat, because 
there were other things to do. He 
went out into the pasture and 
caught up Bess and hitched her to 
the stoneboat and went down into 
the woods. 

He hitched her to the birdcage 
that was wrapped around the tree 
and she pulled it loose as pretty as 
you please. Then he loaded it on 
the stoneboat and hauled it up the 
hill and stowed it in the back of 
the machine shed, in the far corner 
by the forge. 



A DEATH IN THE HOUSE 



93 



After that, he hitched Bess to 
the garden plow and gave the gard- 
en a cultivating that it didn’t need 
so it would be fresh dirt all over 
and no one could locate where he’d 
dug the grave. 

XT E was just finishing the plow- 
ing when Sheriff Doyle drove 
up and got out of the car. The 
sheriff was a soft-sp>oken man, but 
he was no dawdler. He got right 
to the point. 

“I hear,” he said, “you found 
something in the woods.” 

“That I did,” said Mose. 

“I hear it died on you.” 

“Sheriff, you heard right” 

“I’d like to see it, Mose.” 

“Can’t. I buried it. And I ain’t 
telling where.” 

“Mose,” the sheriff said, “I don’t 
want to make you trouble, but you 
did an illegal thing. You can’t go 
finding people in the woods and 
just bury them when they up and 
die on you.” 

“You talk to Doc Benson?” 

The sheriff nodded. “He said it 
wasn’t any kind of thing he’d ever 
seen before. He said it wasn’t hu- 
man.” 

“Well, then,” said Mose, “I guess 
that lets you out. If it wasn’t hu- 
man, there could be no crime 
against a person. And if it wasn’t 
owned, there ain’t any crime 
against property. There’s been no 
one around to claim they owned 
the thing, is there?” 



The sheriff rubbed his chin. “No, 
there hasn’t. Maybe you’re right. 
Where did you study law?” 

“I never studied law. I never 
studied nothing. I just use common 
sense.” 

“Doc said something about the 
folks up at the university might 
want a look at it.” 

“I tell you. Sheriff,” said Mose. 
“This thing came here from some- 
where and it died. I don’t know 
where it came from and I don’t 
know what it was and I don’t hank- 
er none to know. To me it was just 
a living thing that needed help real 
bad. It was alive and it had its 
dignity and in death it command- 
ed some respect When the rest of 
you refused it decent burial, I did 
the best I could. And that is all 
there is to it” 

“All right Mose,” the sheriff 
said, “if that’s how you want it” 

He turned around and stalked 
back to the car. Mose stood beside 
old Bess hitched to her plow and 
watched him drive away. He drove 
fast and reckless as if he might be 
angry. 

Mose put the plow away and 
turned the horse back to the pas- 
ture and by now it was time to do 
chores again. 

He got the chores all finished 
and made himself some supjjer and 
after supper sat beside the stove, 
listening to the ticking of the clock, 
loud in the silent house, and the 
crackle of the fire. 



94 



GALAXY 



All night long the house was 
lonely. 

The next afternoon, as he was 
plowing com, a reporter came and 
walked up the row with him and 
talked with him when he came to 
the end of the row. Mose didn’t 
like this reporter much. He was too 
flip and he asked some funny ques- 
tions, so Mose clammed up and 
didn’t tell him much. 

A few days later, a man showed 
up from the university and 
showed him the story the reporter 
had gone back and written. The 
story made fun of Mose. 

“I’m sorry,” the professor said. 
“These newspapermen are unac- 
countable. I wouldn’t worry too 
much about anything they write.” 

“I don’t,” Mose told him. 

The man from the university 
asked a lot of questions and made 
quite a point about how important 
it was that he should see the body. 

But Mose only shook his head. 
“It’s at peace,” he said. “I aim to 
leave it that way.” 

The man went away disgusted, 
but still quite dignified. 

For several days there were 
people driving by and dropping 
in, the idly curious, and there were 
some neighbors Mose hadn’t seen 
for months. But he gave them all 
short shrift and in a little while 
they left him alone and he went on 
with his farming and the house 
stayed lonely. 



He thought again that maybe he 
should get a dog, but he thought 
of Towser and he couldn’t do it. 

One day, working in the garden, 
he found the plant that grew out of 
the grave. It was a funny-looking 
plant and his first impulse was to 
root it out. 

But he didn’t do it, for the plant 
intrigued him. It was a kind he’d 
never seen before and he decided 
he would let it grow, for a while 
at least, to see what kind it was. It 
was a bulky, fleshy plant, with 
heavy, dark-green, curling leaves, 
and it reminded him in some ways 
of the skunk cabbage that burgeon- 
ed in the woods come spring. 

There was another visitor, the 
queerest of the lot. He was a dark 
and intense man who said he was 
the president of a flying saucer 
club. He wanted to know if Mose 
had talked with the thing he’d 
found out in the woods and seemed 
terribly disappointed when Mose 
told him he hadn’t. He wanted to 
know if Mose had found a vehicle 
the creature might have traveled 
in and Mose lied to him about it. 
He was afraid, the wild way the 
man was acting, that he might de- 
mand to search the place, and if he 
had, he’d likely have found the 
birdcage hidden in the machine 
shed back in the corner by the 
forge. But the man got to lecturing 
Mose about withholding vital in- 
formation. 

Finally Mose had taken all he 



A DEATH IN THE HOUSE 



95 



could of it, so he stepp>ed into the 
house and picked up the shotgun 
from behind the door. The presi- 
dent of the flying saucer club said 
good-by rather hastily and got out 
of there. 

Farm life went on as usual, with 
the corn laid by and the haying 
started and out in the garden the 
strange plant kept on growing and 
now was taking shape. Old Mose 
couldn’t believe his eyes when he 
saw the sort of shape it took and 
he spent long evening hours just 
standing in the garden, watching it 
and wondering if his loneliness 
were playing tricks on him. 

' I ■’HE morning came when he 
found the plant standing at the 
door and waiting for him. He should 
have been surprised, of course, but 
he really wasn’t, for he had lived 
with it, watching it of eventide, and 
although he had not dared admit 
it even to himself, he had known 
what it was. 

For here was the creature he’d 
found in the woods, no longer sick 
and keening, no longer close to 
death, but full of life and youth. 

It was not the same entirely, 
though. He stood and looked at it 
and could see the differences — the 
little differences that might have 
been those between youth and age, 
or between a father and a son, or 
again the differences expressed in 
an evolutionary pattern. 

“Good morning,” said Mose, not 



feeling strange at all to be talking 
to the thing. “It’s good to have you 
back.” 

The thing standing in the yard 
did not answer him. But that was 
not important; he had not expected 
that it would. The one important 
point was that he had something 
he could talk to. 

“I’m going out to do the chores,” 
said Mose. “You want to tag 
along?” 

It tagged along with him and it 
watched him as he did the chores 
and he talked to it, which was a 
vast improvement over talking to 
himself. 

At breakfast, he laid an extra 
plate for it and pulled up an extra 
chair, but it turned out the critter 
was not equipped to use a chair, 
for it wasn’t hinged to sit. 

Nor did it eat. That bothered 
Mose at first, for he was hospit- 
able, but he told himself that a big, 
strong, strapping youngster like 
this one knew enough to take care 
of itself, and he probably didn’t 
need to worry too much about how 
it got along. 

After breakfast, he went out to 
the garden, with the critter accom- 
panying him, and sure enough, the 
plant was gone. There was a col- 
lapsed husk lying on the ground, 
the outer covering that had been 
the cradle of the creature at his 
side. 

Then he went to the machine 
shed and the creature saw the bird- 



96 



GALAXY 




A DEATH IN THE HOUSE 



97 



cage and rushed over to it and 
looked it over minutely. Then it 
turned around to Mose and made 
a sort of pleading gesture. 

Mose went over to it and laid his 
hands on one of the twisted bars 
and the critter stood beside him 
and laid its hands on, too, and they 
pulled together. It was no use. 
They could move the metal some, 
but not enough to pull it back in 
shape again. 

They stood and looked at one 
another, although looking may not 
be the word, for the critter had no 
eyes to look with. It made some 
funny motions with its hands, but 
Mose couldn’t understand. Then it 
lay down on the floor and showed 
him how the birdcage ribs were 
fastened to the base. 

T T took a while for Mose to un- 
^ derstand how the fastening 
worked and he never did know ex- 
actly why it did. There wasn’t, 
actually, any reason that it should 
work that way. 

First you applied some pressure, 
just the right amount at the exact 
and correct angle, and the bar 
would move a little. Then you ap- 
plied some more pressure, again the 
exact amount and at the proper 
angle, and the bar would move 
some more. You did this three 
times and the bar came loose, al- 
though there was, God knows, no 
reason why it should. 

Mose started a fire in the forge 



and shoveled in some coal and 
worked the bellows while the crit- 
ter watched. But when he picked 
up the bar to put it in the fire, the 
critter got between him and the 
forge and wouldn’t let him near. 
Mose realized then he couldn’t — 
or wasn’t supposed to — heat the 
bar to straighten it and he never 
questioned the entire rightness of 
it. For, he told himself, this thing 
must surely know the proper way 
to do it 

So he took the bar over to the 
anvil and started hammering it 
back into shape again, cold, with- 
out the use of fire, while the crit- 
ter tried to show him the shape 
that it should be. It took quite a 
while, but finally it was straight- 
ened out to the critter’s satisfac- 
tion. 

Mose figured they’d have them- 
selves a time getting the bar back 
in place again, but it slipped on as 
slick as could be. 

Then they took off another bar 
and this one went faster, now that 
Mose had the hang of it. 

But it was hard and grueling 
labor. They worked all day and 
only straightened out five bars. 

It took four solid days to get the 
bars on the birdcage hammered 
into shape and all the time the hay 
was waiting to be cut. 

But it was all right with Mose. 
He had someone to talk to and the 
house had lost its loneliness. 

When they got the bars back in 



98 



GALAXY 



place, the critter slipped into the 
cage and starting foiling with a 
dingus on the roof of it that looked 
like a complicated basket. Mose, 
watching, figured that the basket 
was some sort of control. 

The critter was discouraged. It 
walked around the shed looking 
for something and seemed unable 
to find it. It came back to Mose 
and made its despairing, pleading 
gesture. Mose showed it iron and 
steel; he dug into a carton where 
he kept bolts and clamps and bush- 
ings and scraps of metal and other 
odds and ends, finding brass and 
copper and even some aluminum, 
but it wasn’t any of these. 

And Mose was glad — a bit 
ashamed for feeling glad, but glad 
all the same. 

For it had been clear to him that 
when the birdcage was all ready, 
the critter would be leaving him. 
It had been impossible for Mose to 
stand in the way of the repair of the 
cage, or to refuse to help. But now 
that it apparently couldn’t be, he 
found himself well pleased. 

Now the critter would have to 
stay with him and he’d have some- 
one to talk to and the house would 
not be lonely. It would be welcome, 
he told himself, to have folks again. 
The critter was almost as good a 
companion as Towser. 

EXT morning, while Mose was 
^ fixing breakfast, he reached up 
in the cupboard to get the box of 

A DEATH IN THE HOUSE 



oatmeal and his hand struck the 
cigar box and it came crashing to 
the floor. It fell over on its side 
and the lid came open and the dol- 
lars went free-wheeling all around 
the kitchen. 

Out of the corner of his eye, 
Mose saw the critter leaping quick- 
ly in pursuit of one of them. It 
snatched it up and turned to Mose, 
with the coin held between its fin- 
gers, and a sort of thrumming noise 
was coming out of the nest of 
worms on top of it. 

It bent and scooped up more 
of them and cuddled them and 
danced a sort of jig, and Mose 
knew, with a sinking heart, that it 
had been silver the critter had been 
hunting. 

So Mose got down on his hands 
and knees and helped the critter 
gather up all the dollars. They put 
them back into the cigar box and 
Mose picked up the box and gave 
it to the critter. 

The critter took it and hefted it 
and had a disappointed look. Tak- 
ing the box over to the table, it took 
the dollars out and stacked them in 
neat piles and Mose could see it 
was very disappointed. 

Perhaps, after all, Mose thought, 
it had not been silver the thing had 
been hunting for. Maybe it had 
made a mistake in thinking that 
the silver was some other kind of 
metal. 

Mose got down the oatmeal and 
poured it into some water and put 

99 




it on the stove. When it was co<^ed 
and the coffee was ready, he car- 
ried his breakfast to the table and 
sat down to eat. 

The critter still was standing 
across the table from him, stacking 
and restacking the piles of silver 
dollars. And now it showed him, 
with a hand held above the stacks. 



that it needed more of them. This 
many stacks, it showed him, and 
each stack so high. 

Mose sat stricken, with a spoon 
full of oatmeal halfway to his 
mouth. He thought of all those 
other dollars, the iron kettle 
packed with them, underneath the 
floor boards in the living room. And 



100 



GALAXY 




he couldn’t do it; they were the 
only thing he had — except the crit- 
ter now. And he could not give 
them up so the critter could go and 
leave him too. 

He ate his bowl of oatmeal with- 
out tasting it and drank two cups 
of coffee. And all the time the crit- 
ter stood there and showed him 



how much more it needed. 

“I can’t do it for you,” Old Mose 
said. “I’ve done all you can expect 
of any living being. I found you 
in the woods and I gave you 
warmth and shelter. I tried to help 
you, and when I couldn’t, at least 
I gave you a place to die in. I 
buried you and protected you from 
all those other people and I did 
not pull you up when you started 
growing once again. Surely you 
can’t expect me to keep on giving 
endlessly.” 

But it was no good. The critter 
could not hear him and he did not 
convince himself. 

TTE got up from the table and 
walked into the living room 
with the critter trailing him. He 
loosened the floor boards and took 
out the kettle, and the critter, when 
it saw what was in the kettle, put 
its arms around itself and hugged 
in happniess. 

They lugged the money out to 
the machine shed and Mose built 
a fire in the forge and put the ket- 
tle in the fire and started melting 
down that hard-saved money. 

There were times he thought he 
couldn’t finish the job, but he did. 

The critter got the basket out 
of the birdcage and put it down 
beside the forge and dipped out the 
molten silver with an iron ladle 
and poured it here and there into 
the basket, shaping it in place with 
careful hammer taps. 



A DEATH IN THE HOUSE 



101 



It took a long time, for it was 
exacting work, but finally it was 
done and the silver almost gone. 
The critter lugged the basket back 
into the birdcage and fastened it 
in place. 

It was almost evening now and 
Mose had to go and do the chores. 
He half expected the thing might 
haul out the birdcage and be gone 
when he came back to the house. 
And he tried to be sore at it for its 
selfishness — it had taken from him 
and had not tried to pay him back 
— it had not, so far as he could tell, 
even tried to thank him. But he 
made a poor job of being sore at it. 

It was waiting for him when he 
came from the barn carrying two 
pails full of milk. It followed him 
inside the house and stood around 
and he tried to talk to it. But he 
didn’t have the heart to do much 
talking. He could not forget that 
it would be leaving, and the pleas- 
ure of its present company was 
lost in his terror of the loneliness 
to come. 

For now he didn’t even have his 
money to help ward off the lone- 
liness. 

As he lay in bed that night, 
strange thoughts came creeping in 
upon him — the thought of an even 
greater loneliness than he had ever 
known upon this runty farm, the 
terrible, devastating loneliness of 
the empty wastes that lay between 
the stars, a driven loneliness while 
one hunted for a place or p>erson 



that remained a misty thought one 
could not define, but which it was 
most important one should find. 

It was a strange thing for him to 
be thinking, and quite suddenly he 
knew it was no thought of his, but 
of this other that was in the room 
with him. 

He tried to raise himself, he 
fought to raise himself, but he 
couldn’t do it He held his head up a 
moment, then fell back upon the 
pillow and went sound asleep. 

IV EXT morning, after Mose had 

' eaten breakfast, the two of 
them went to the machine shed and 
dragged the birdcage out It stood 
there, a weird alien thing, in the 
chill brightness of the dawn. 

The critter walked up to it and 
started to slide between two of the 
bars, but when it was halfway 
through, it stepped out again and 
moved over to confront Old Mose. 

“Good-by, friend,” said Mose. 
“I’ll miss you.” 

There was a strange stinging in 
his eyes. 

The other held out its hand in 
farewell, and Mose took it and 
there was something in the hand 
he grasped, something round and 
smooth that was transferred from 
its hand to his. 

The thing took its hand away 
and stepped quickly to the bird- 
cage and slid between the bars. 
The hands reached for the basket 
and there was a sudden flicker and 



102 



GALAXY 



the birdcage was no longer there. 

Mose stood lonely in the barn- 
yard, looking at the place where 
there was no birdcage and remem- 
bering what he had felt or thought 
— or been told? — the night before 
as he lay in bed. 

Already the critter would be 
there, out between the stars, in 
that black and utter loneliness, 
hunting for a place or thing or per- 
son that no human mind could 
grasp. 

Slowly Mose turned around to 
go back to the house, to get the 
pails and go down to the barn to 
get the milking done. 

He remembered the object in 
his hand and lifted his still- 
clenched fist in front of him. He 
opened his fingers and the little 
crystal ball lay there in his palm— 
and it was exactly like the one he’d 
found in the slitted flap in the body 
he had buried in the garden. Except 
that one had been dead and cloudy 
and this one had the living glow of 
a distant-burning fire. 

Looking at it, he had the strange 
feeling of a happiness and comfort 
such as he had seldom known be- 
fore, as if there were many people 
with him and all of them were 
friends. 

He closed his hand upon it and 
the happiness stayed on — and it 
was all wrong, for there was not a 



single reason that he should be hap- 
py. The critter finally had left him 
and his money was all gone and 
he had no friends, but still he kept 
on feeling good. 

He put the ball into his pocket 
and stepped spryly for the house 
to get the milking pails. He pursed 
up his whiskered lips and began to 
whistle and it had been a long, long 
time since he had even thought to 
whistle. 

Maybe he was happy, he told 
himself, because the critter had 
not left without stopping to take 
his hand and try to say good-by. 

And a gift, no matter how worth- 
less it might be, how cheap a trin- 
ket, still had a basic value in simple 
sentiment. It had been many years 
since anyone had bothered to give 
him a gift. 

¥T was dark and lonely and un- 
ending in the depths of space 
with no Companion. It might be 
long before another was obtain- 
able. 

It perhaps was a foolish thing 
to do, but the old creature had 
been such a kind savage, so fum- 
bling and so pitiful and eager to 
help. And one who travels far and 
fast must likewise travel light. 
There had been nothing else to 
give.

No monarchy was ever more legal 
than his — he had outlived every 
last challenger for the throne! 



By WILSON TUCKER 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



T he king was annoyingly 
awakened before dawn by 
a noise in the sky. 

The noise was an ear-splitting 
roar, an avalanche of sound, a rush- 
ing, tumbling, thunderous reverber- 
ation which hlled the heavens from 
one horizon to another, the kind of 
noise — and the volume — that 
might be expected on the day the 
sun cracked open. The shattering 



thunder shook the stout old build- 
ing, causing the king of the planet 
to creep from his shabby bed and 
go to the window. The dawn was 
still an hour or more away. 

Nothing but empty sky and the 
roseate flush in the east was visible 
from the tiny window, but yet the 
echoes of intruding soimd lapped 
about the building. Blinking away 
sleep and muttering at the trespass. 



104 



GALAXY 



the king went to the door, circuit- 
ously avoiding the cracked marble 
urn in the exact center of the room 
which contained his drinking water. 
He stepped out into the high 
grasses surrounding the building 
and turned to look skyward. It was 
there, as he had guessed. 

The source of the monstrous 
noise was a monstrous vehicle hang- 
ing many miles above him, as sta- 
tionary as a rock, but even at that 
distance its enormous size was ap- 
parent. The thing hung effortlessly 
in the early morning sky, washed 
with the new sunlight, and seemed 
to be supported on small tongues of 
flame which everywhere studded 
its massive belly. A coruscating en- 
velope of pale blue, much like an- 
cient neon lighting, laved the ve- 
hicle to create an eerie illusion in 
the yellowish rays of the sun. The 
tremendous sound that had awak- 
ened him had been caused by the 
braking effort of the great machine. 

The king studied it closely for 
many minutes, watching for a Sign 
— an Omen, searching for a sacred 
Token to suggest that it might be 
something other than what his 
mundane senses had taken it to be. 
He waited, but a Revelation did 
not come. There was nothing about 
the machine to excite his hop>es. 

It was only a starship. 

T T had disturbed his sleep and it 
was nothing more than a star- 
ship, probably inhabited by a pack 



of crazy fools bent on exploring 
each new planet to fall within their 
sights. Now they had discovered 
his, and in a few hours hordes of 
them would be descending on him. 

The starship was too large and 
ungainly to land, but the people on 
it — if they were people — would 
come down on him like mosquitoes, 
in small scouting vessels, and con- 
duct themselves like imbeciles on 
a picnic. Their military men would 
eye him suspiciously and cast dark 
glances at the surrounding forests. 
Their linguists would buzz about 
with primitive signs and symbols 
in an effort to establish communi- 
cation. Their botanists would up- 
root great masses of weeds. Their 
archeologists would ransack the 
ruins and gouge deep holes in the 
ground, plundering graves, to car- 
ry away what they believed to be 
precious treasures, while their com- 
mander — ahh, the commander! 

That nincompoop would fatu- 
ously plant a flag, or its gaudy 
equivalent, in the soil and claim 
ownership of the new world for his 
distant sovereign. The nincompoop 
would cheerfully ignore, of course, 
the very obvious fact that this 
world already possessed a sover- 
eign. 

A pox on them. Let them come 
down and play, and then go away 
again. They were not Significant. 
The starship had offered no Sign, 
and he was not greatly interested 
in its coming. 



KING OF THE PLANET 



105 



The king of the planet returned 
indoors and let himself down on the 
hard bed. He ruminated a short 
while and then drifted off to sleep, 
confident that their noisy scurry- 
ings would awaken him later. 

He had momentarily considered 
closing the door, and then decided 
against it. The prying archeologists 
would probably come inside any- 
way; they would not be able to 
resist temptation, for the king’s in- 
digent residence was a marble mau- 
soleum nearly hidden among the 
weeds and wild grasses of an in- 
credibly ancient cemetery. 

The king of the planet lived in 
a mausoleum because the structure 
had withstood the ravages of time, 
because he had made it somewhat 
comfortable, and because it had 
seemed the best place to wait. 

A FEW minutes after sunrise, 
a single scout left the mother 
ship and landed almost directly be- 
neath it, resting quietly— but watch- 
fully — on a grassy clearing well 
away from the dense woods. More 
than half of the crew of twenty had 
emerged from the scout and fanned 
out, each crew member going about 
his particular bysiness. Some of 
their number had already discov- 
ered a promising mound and were 
bringing up heavy equipment to 
probe its probable mystery. One 
man was taking samples of the 
vegetation, while another was trap- 
ping insects in the soil. 



Within the small scout ship, a 
woman hunched over a set of scan- 
ning instruments, her head con- 
cealed in an enveloping hood, the 
better to watch a series of glass 
plates. She listened to a contact 
speaker fastened behind an ear and 
spoke into a throat microphone. 
There was a gentle excitement in 
her voice, but no trace of fear or 
hysteria. 

“The life-form is approaching 
from the northwest. Movement 
slow but progress steady. Near you. 
Seven.” 

And a response from the clear- 
ing: “Seven, check.” 

The woman continued, dividing 
her attention between two devices: 
“It appears to be warm-blooded 
and intelligent. It does not show 
fear of us, nor does there seem to 
be curiosity. I see nothing to indi- 
cate a weapon; it is carrying some- 
thing that might be a walking stick. 
Are you tracking. Seven?” 

“Negative,” Seven reported. 
“The trees interfere.” 

“Eight?” the woman asked next. 
“Eight, negative,” a new voice 
said. “I read nothing but soil life.” 
“There are birds in the far dis- 
tance,” she advised. “I expect our 
arrival has frightened them away. 
I have discovered no animal life 
except for — It has stopped.” She 
scanned the disc attentively. “It has 
put down the walking stick. Now 
it is behind a tree. I am receiving 
only a small positive signal.” 



106 



GALAXY 



A deep male voice cut into the 
circuit. “Nineteen here,” it said. 
“Your animal is intelligent. It put 
down the stick to avoid its being 
mistaken for a weapon, and now 
is likely peeping at us from behind 
a tree. I’ll be right out with a trans- 
lator.” The male voice was exultant. 
“Gently, gentlemen, gently. We’ve 
found a prize!” 

The woman at the scanner spoke 
up. “The object is moving — coming 
directly toward the vessel. Seven, 
it is almost upon you! Don’t you see 
it?” 

“Nega — correction.” His voice 
jumped. “It’s coming out now. I see 
it!” 

“Eight, move in and cover,” the 
woman snapped. “Two, start re- 
cording.” 

“I’m forty-five seconds ahead of 
you,” Two replied dryly. “Sight, 
sound and depth.” 

“Be careful!” Nineteen cried. 
“Don’t scare it away. What is it — 
what does it look like?” 

^ I ^ HE communication channel 
was silent for a moment and 
then Seven said, “It looks like you. 
It’s a man.” 

“Are you certain?” the woman 
demanded. 

“It’s a man,” the dry voice of the 
recorder cut in. “I can tell by his 
innards.” 

Seven reported: “An old man; 
quite aged by the looks of him. Ex- 
tremely long hair and long beard. 



He is naked — I think. And he 
needs a bath.” 

“Weapons?” 

“Negative, unless there is one 
hidden under the beard. There — 
he’s out of the woods. See him?” 

“I see him,” she answered, and 
stared for a long moment. “I wish 
I could be more impressed. Well, 
I suppose we must extend the cus- 
tomary welcome. He is the only 
life-form—” she corrected herself — 
“the only human to reveal sign on 
this planet. Stand by. Seven.” 

The king of the planet left the 
shadow of the trees and made his 
careful way into the clearing. He 
moved slowly because he could not 
trust his limbs to any reasonable 
speed and because he did not want 
to frighten the visitors into an un- 
friendly act. He had no wish to be 
a cripple after their departure. 

The king paused ten or twelve 
feet short of the nearest intruder 
and examined the ship. His exami- 
nation was a cursory one because 
he was little interested in its origin, 
its means of locomotion, or its 
physical properties. There had been 
others like it and unlike it, and 
doubtless there were more to come. 
The ship and the travelers were 
merely transients. 

The impudent young fellow a 
dozen feet away stared at him with 
a friendly, idiotic grin. His feet 
were braced wide apart, his hands 
were outstretched — palms upward 
— in the usual gesture of welcome. 



KING OF THE PLANET 



107 




108 



GALAXY 



and not too far away his mate 
waited with one hand resting on 
the butt of a weapon. They were 
military men, making their cus- 
tomary two-faced show of wel- 
come. 

The king looked at the friendly 
face and the grinning lips and 
wanted to snarl, looked at the up- 
turned palms and wanted to spit 
on them, but he realized that such 
behavior would only complicate 
matters. It was better to help them 
tidy up their business and send 
them on their way. 

He stuck out his two hands in 
an imitative gesture and tried to 
smile. It didn’t quite come off. 

“Now that’s done,” he grunted. 
“Get on with your picking and clear 
off my planet!” 

C EVEN did not understand him, 
^ of course, and promptly 
launched into a lengthy torrent of 
unintelligible speech which was the 
Response Courteous, the standard 
rejoinder to a native welcome. 

The Response Courteous was 
grandiose, pompous and rhetorical, 
punctuated with graceful gestures 
and primitive symbolisms; the elo- 
quent sentry called upon the local 
rain god to increase the old man’s 
crops and upon the sun god to bless 
his aged bones; he complimented 
the native on his health, wealth and 
appearance, thanked him for so gra- 
ciously offering the hospitality of 
his planet, begged him to allow 

KING OF THE PLANET 



them to stay a few days more that 
they might explore and catalogue 
the new world, flattered him with 
the observation that no other mud 
ball in the Universe was so beauti- 
ful as this one, assured him that 
they would do harm to none, and 
ended — finally — by respectfully 
inquiring after the old one’s love- 
ly wife (wives?) and sturdy chil- 
dren. 

It was an impressive speech, re- 
cited letter-perfect from the field 
manual. 

The sentry then bowed and 
mumbled an aside into his micro- 
phone. “I don’t think I want to meet 
his lovely wife. I wish I was up- 
wind of him.” 

Two, the dry commentator oper- 
ating the recording machine, sug- 
gested; “Perhaps you’d better run 
through that again. Nothing stirred 
beneath the leathery hide.” 

“I’ll make you a wager,” Seven 
retorted. “I don’t believe he has a 
rain god.” 

“Patience, gentlemen — I’m com- 
ing.” Nineteen came running from 
the lock of the scout ship. He car- 
ried a large bronze box which con- 
tained his own specialized explor- 
ing tool, and he was wearing a large, 
pleased smile. Behind him ran a 
pretty, youthful girl carrying two 
pillows. 

The newcomers slowed cau- 
tiously as they approached the king 
of the planet and set down their 
equipment for his inspection. The 

109 



king ignored Nineteen and his box 
to stare at the girl and her pillows. 

She dropped to her knees, placed 
a pillow on the ground behind him, 
and invited him to sit. The king sat, 
staring at the girl’s bosom and bare 
legs. She smiled winningly and 
moved over to place a pillow for 
her superior. Nineteen seated him- 
self and opened the lid of the 
bronze box. It contained an array 
of instruments and two slim bronze 
cables which terminated in hand- 
grips. 

T^INETEEN placed a micro- 

' phone on the ground between 
himself and the native, switched 
on his apparatus and motioned to 
the assistant. The girl removed the 
coiled cables from their nest and 
gave one to the old man, showing 
him how to hold the grooved han- 
dle with his curled fingers. The 
other cable was given to the smil- 
ing translator. An electrical con- 
nection was completed between the 
two men, monitored by the trans- 
lating rig. 

“H-2 type,” Nineteen murmured 
into his throat microphone. 

“H-2 sub-a,” the distant recorder 
corrected him matter-of-factly. 
“Plus sub-something else which I 
am not qualified to identify. I rec- 
ognize only a vague x quality to his 
digestive and regenerative sys- 
tems.” 

“Beetles and birchbark,” was 
Seven’s snide reply. 

110 



“Perhaps, but I daresay Hun- 
dred-Ten would like to lay him on 
her surgical table upstairs. He’d 
make a splendid subject for study.” 
Nineteen cleared his throat 
meaningfully and the communica- 
tion circuit went silent. He smiled 
again at the dour old man who was 
eying the girl. 

“How do you do, sir?” 

The king of the planet stared 
down at the handgrip in his gnarled 
fingers and wondered how they’d 
managed that trick; he had both 
heard and felt the smiling idiot’s 
words, and the utilization of the 
two senses enabled him to grasp 
the meaning of the question. It also 
caused him to realize they would 
understand his replies only too well, 
unless he was careful. 

(The recorder whispered: “Cu- 
riosity, and mental reservations.”) 
(“I expected it,” Nineteen re- 
plied.) To the old one, he said, “I 
am Nineteen, a linguist. Who are 
you?” 

No harm in answering that. “I 
am the king of the planet.” 
Nineteen watched the analyzers 
in the bronze box. (His communi- 
cator whispered: “Truth, pride.”) 
“What are you called, sir?” 

The king grunted. “Many things. 
Ahasuerus, Joseph, Isaac, Salatheil 
ben Sadi ... I am called many 
names.” 

(The whisper: “Bitterness.”) 
Nineteen correctly deduced that 
the old one had referred to him- 



GALAXY 



self as the leader, or overlord, of 
the entire world; but the multiplici- 
ty of names confused him and he 
was not certain that he could pro- 
nounce any of them accurately. 

f f 1 O-SEFF,” he said, and 

tl watched to see if the native 
took offense at a possible mispro- 
nunciation. “The leader of the 
world. Where are your people, Jo- 
seff?” 

“The damned fools are dead,” the 
king retorted. “Every one of them.” 
“They have expired? All of 
them?” 

“That’s what I said.” 

“How did they die, Jo-seff? Why 
did they die?” 

“Because they were damned 
fools.” 

(“Vituperation, anger, vague 
hatred.”) 

Nineteen repeated gently, “How 
did they die? What caused all their 
deaths, Jo-seff?” 

“Peace!” the king spat. “Eternal 
peace. Senility, sterility, boredom, 
retrogression. They curled up in 
their chosen wombs and died.” 

“I don’t understand, Jo-seff.” 
“That’s too bad.” The king ab- 
ruptly switched languages because 
it pleased him to do so and because 
his interrogator was becoming too 
inquisitive. He lapsed into Latin, a 
tongue barely remembered. “They 
abolished conflict and returned to 
Paradise. That was the end of 
them.” 



(Two reported: “Evasive tac- 
tics, but still truth.”) 

Nineteen frowned and realized 
something was amiss. He studied 
his analyzers but found nothing 
wrong there; they continued to 
monitor and report the speech pat- 
terns in the normal fashion, giving 
normal readings, but despite that, 
he recognized a change in routine. 
The ancient king’s subjects had 
stopped fighting among themselves 
and perished as a result— that much 
was clear. But the exact manner of 
their going and the last two sen- 
tences were puzzling. 

(“Is this doubletalk?” he asked 
the recorder.) 

(“No, sir. Clear and straightfor- 
ward.”) 

“They died suffering p>eace, Jo- 
seff?” 

“They did.” 

“How can this be?” 

“Easier than you think.” 

“You did not die with them?” 
Nineteen asked tactfully. 

The king glowered, considering 
the question silly. 

Nineteen rephrased the question. 
“Can you tell me, sir, why you did 
not suffer this same death?” 

“I refused peace.” 

“It was a matter of acceptance or 
rejection?” 

“It was.” 

“You are the only living human 
in all this world?” 

“I am.” 

“I do not understand how they 

in 



KING OF THE PLANET 



all suffered and died of this peace 
simultaneously.” 

“I didn’t say that!” the king 
snapped. “Idiot.” He searched 
among the languages familiar to 
him and said, “Degeneration. Dry 
rot requires only a few centuries.” 

A GAIN the interpreter noted a 
subtle but baffling difference 
to the response. As before, the old 
man’s answer was partly under- 
stood and partly guessed at, and, 
as before, the analyzing equipment 
performed in normal fashion, but 
for the second time there had been 
an undefined change in the proced- 
ure. “Degeneration” and “dry rot” 
were undoubtedly a form of slow 
death; while “centuries” was prob- 
ably one or more measurable units 
of time. 

“I ask your pardon, great leader,” 
Nineteen continued smoothly. “I 
believe I now understand. Your 
subjects suffered peace for a num- 
ber of centuries and gradually per- 
ished; a kind of lingering death. Is 
that correct?” 

The king of the planet nodded 
dourly, his attentive eyes following 
the lithe movements of the young 
girl as she fidgeted in the grass. 

“Thank you, sir. And what is a 
century?" 

“One hundred years.” 

“Ah, yes. And what constitutes 
a year, sir?” 

“One revolution about tbe sun!” 
The king looked at his questioner 

112 



with scorn. “Is a star-traveler igno- 
rant of the most basic astronomy?” 
Nineteen jumped with astonish- 
ment and listened to the murmur of 
surprise on the communication cir- 
cuit. “Ah — then you are aware of 
our identity?” 

The king was disgusted. “I know 
a starship when I see one, you fool!” 
“Your great wisdom pleases me, 
honorable leader. Have other star- 
ships visited your kingdom?” 

“Of course. How else would I 
know, stupid?” 

(The woman at the scanning 
plates said excitedly: “There are 
no records of any known ship visit- 
ing this planet.”) 

(The recording engineer said: 
“Nonetheless, he’s telling the truth. 
And he thinks us a pack of fools.”) 
(“Most amazing,” Nineteen com- 
mented. “And perhaps we are — he 
certainly was not excited to see us, 
remember. Evidently his memory 
antedates our records. Let’s put the 
prime question.”) 

Nineteen returned his attention 
to the native. “August leader, you 
must have lived a very long time to 
have watched your people perish 
over the centuries, and to have seen 
the visiting starships. Good sir, 
what is the number of your glorious 
years?” 

Bitterly, the king of the planet 
told him. 

The answer was not immediate- 
ly intelligible, for it involved still 
another x unit of local time, and, to 



GALAXY 



compound matters, there had been 
still another shift of tonal values. 
Grimly, not unmixed with annoy- 
ance, the king once more changed 
languages and answered the ques- 
tion — quite honestly — in Moabit- 
ish. 

His questioner could only deter- 
mine that the old man’s unusual life 
span had stretched over an x num- 
ber of centuries, and he had to be 
content with that for the time be- 
ing. But the interrogation con- 
tinued. 

OR the remainder of that day, 

and the following three, the 
space visitors posed endless ques- 
tions. They were insatiable. 

Nineteen, prompted by whispers 
from within the ship, from those 
waiting far above, and from the 
technicians working about the 
clearing, valiantly attempted to 
pump the king of his knowledge of 
anthropology, archeology, astrono- 
my, architecture, biology (running 
from botany through zoology — al- 
though biometrics proved to be a 
most frustrating business), chem- 
istry, commerce, electronics, geol- 
ogy and geography, history (a fruit- 
ful mass of data!), mathematics, 
medicine and pharmacy, mythol- 
ogy, numeration — the list of sub- 
jects and the many detailed ques- 
tions pertinent to each appeared 
to have no end. 

The visitors pried and the old 
man answered in his fashion. He 

KING OF THE PLANET 



darted from one subfamily of lan- 
guages to another, leaping from 
tongue to dialect and back again, 
watching the interpreter with mali- 
cious amusement. Without warn- 
ing, he would turn from ultra-mod- 
ern English to Prakrit, to Illyrian, 
to French, to Avestan, to Vulgate 
Latin, to Chaldean, to Pahlavi and 
then to Umbrian, always secretly 
amused in the belief that he was 
bewildering the inquisitor. His mas- 
tery of the many languages was as 
complete as his aged memory 
would permit and he was enjoy- 
ing himself — until he suddenly dis- 
covered that the space visitor was 
wise to his game. 

At some time during the lengthy 
sessions, the visitor had discovered 
the subterfuge and thereafter 
ignored the dazzling changes. The 
king of the planet lapsed into 
Aramic, his favorite tongue, and 
remained there. The malicious fun 
was lost. 

The sessions were, not continu- 
ous. They paused many times to 
rest because the king tired, and be- 
cause he would fall into moody si- 
lences that could not be broken un- 
til he was ready to break them. 
They stopped then to eat and drink, 
and the young girl would bring food 
from the ship and place it before 
the old one. 

He ate sparingly. 

They took the time to inspect the 
many small discoveries the arche- 
ologists were bringing back from 

113 



the ancient cemetery, and at the 
close of each day they closed up 
shop to sleep. The king refused the 
invitation to sleep in the scout, or in 
the mother ship hanging far above, 
always preferring to return to his 
mausoleum. 

Before the king quit the clear- 
ing at the end of the first day, he 
made a small request, a mild one 
which surely could offend nobody, 
but it had to be refused. The trans- 
lator was very sorry, but he simply 
could not permit the young girl to 
accompany the king back to his 
bed for the night. It just wasn’t 
done, and besides the girl was un- 
der age. Respectful regret and all 
that 

The king strode away, greatly 
irritated. 

the morning of the second 
day, the king was awakened 
by the noise the archeologists were 
making in the mausoleum, and he 
chased them outdoors. He let them 
know with strong language and un- 
mistakable gestures that his home 
was the one sacred place barred to 
them. They could not knock holes 
in the many vaults lining the mau- 
soleum walls — not even the small 
holes which would admit their 
camera lenses. 

On the morning of the third day, 
the visitors had charted the local 
time sequences to their satisfaction, 
and the newfound knowledge ex- 
cited them. 



Nineteen probed for a solution 
to the riddle. 

“Great sir, did many of your peo- 
ple live through centuries? That is, 
for many hundreds of years?” 
“No.” 

“What was their usual lifetime?” 
“The good died young — they 
knew better than to stay alive. The 
worthless ones stayed longer; they 
were too mean to die.” 

“But what number of years, great 
leader?” Nineteen strove for the 
impression of worshipping at the 
old man’s hardened feet. “How 
young is young?” 

“Thirty or forty years,” the king 
said impatiently. 

“And how old is old?” 

“Seventy, eighty, ninety. A few 
lived past the century.” 

“Ah, yes. But that extreme age 
was a rarity, was it not? Even when 
your subjects were not suffering 
peace?” 

“Of course.” 

“Pardon me, glorious one, but 
I do not understand your age. Why 
is it that you live so long?” 

“I rejected peace — I’ve told you 
that!” 

“You did, good sir, but we still 
do not understand. Is not peace a 
desirable attainment?” 

“It is, until you get it. And then 
you rot.” 

“And you rejected peace and 
thus avoided rotting. I’m afraid that 
isn’t as simple as it sounds, but then 
I do not expect to imderstand the 



114 



GALAXY 



theory. But, sir, there must be some 
rational reason for your tremen- 
dous age, some fact that you have 
not made known to us.” 

The king stared at him, unwilling 
to answer. 

“Have you discovered the secret 
of eternal life?” Nineteen asked 
anxiously. “Do you take drugs? Is 
it a dietary matter? Have you 
found some unknown substance 
which prolongs your life?” 

HE king let his attention wan- 
der and fastened his gaze on the 
young girl, who was helping a bota- 
nist. 

(“Keep at it,” the recording en- 
gineer whispered. “You scored a 
clean hit with one of those ques- 
tions. His pulse raced.”) 

“My own life,” Nineteen said 
smoothly, “and the lives of my com- 
panions are reasonably long. We 
may expect to live about two hun- 
dred years, if we are fortunate.” 
The king pointed at the girl. 
“How old is she?” 

“Not yet forty.” Nineteen smiled. 
“She is my daughter, an apprentice 
to this crew.” Without changing his 
conversational tone, he asked, 
“How old are you?” 

The king replied with the iden- 
tical answer given on the first day. 

“But sir!” the translator declared. 
“That amounts to more than three 
thousand years! And that is incred- 
ible; I can scarcely believe it. How 
does one live for three thousand 



years by simply rejecting peace?” 

“It depends upon the manner of 
rejection,” the old one said dour- 
ly. “And the time, and the place, 
and the catalyst.” His hungering 
gaze would not leave the girl. 

“I’m afraid I do not understand 
you at all.” 

“I didn’t expect you to.” 

“It just isn’t possible to exist for 
so long!” 

“I’m existing.” The king raised 
his eyes to the scout ship. “And that 
fellow yonder knows I’m not lying.” 

(The whisper: “He isn’t lying, 
but you’ve hit on something. I be- 
lieve he is superstitious. Question 
him.”) 

Nineteen did, digging patiently 
but as deeply as he was able, utiliz- 
ing his every skill to draw out the 
old man. He reverted to a subject 
they had discussed on a previous 
day, mythology, and examined it 
more carefully than before. 

A number of significant things 
came to light which had been 
passed over before, and these new 
factors were weighed and balanced 
against all the conversations so far 
recorded. 

In the end. Nineteen admitted to 
a partial defeat. The day drew to a 
close and he packed away his equip- 
ment, preparatory to returning to 
the mother ship; he wished he could 
remain a month or a year with the 
aged native, but that was not pos- 
sible. They were leaving after dark- 
ness fell. 



KING OF THE PLANET 



115 



¥ UGGING their gear and their 
specimens, their recordings and 
their artifacts, the explorers re- 
turned to the scout. The military 
men dismantled the tall pole which 
had been planted in the clearing, 
and reverently packed away the 
varicolored ball that had spun atop 
it. 

Food and drink were left out- 
side, as a final tribute to the king 
of the planet, and the scout was 
made secure for lifting. 

“It is imperative that we return 
to this planet,” Nineteen declared 
later. “Perhaps in a century or two. 
It is important to know if he will 
still be living.” 

“He will be,” Seven predicted 
lightly. “Betties and birchbark will 
keep going forever.” 

“Not forever,” Nineteen contra- 
dicted, ignoring the levity. “Even 
he admitted it. But that last session 
was most productive; it must have 
high priority in translation and 
analysis. I wish I understood it 
more clearly now. No — he won’t 
live forever. He is aware of his 
eventual death, and, if my intuition 
is correct, he is looking forward 
to it. Can you imagine three thou- 
sand years?” 

“I can’t,” Seven replied. 

“Nor I, but I expect we will find 
he is very much correct in the 
figure. No wonder he wants release! 
His future death is hopelessly en- 
tangled in some supernatural fan- 
tasy; I no more understand that 



than I understand his fantastic 
reason for longevity. What is myth 
and what is real?” 

Two said, “He believes in those 
old gods of the myth, believes in 
them flatly and without question. 
Do you suppose there is something 
to m3dhology after all?” 

Nineteen smiled and shrugged. 
“I’m too old to say nonsense, how- 
ever much I am tempted. But how 
many hundreds of fantastic legends 
have we stumbled over? How 
many wild fictions of imaginary 
men and imaginary monsters? 
They persist even in civilized areas. 
This one appears to be simply 
another variation — except that 
this one is living.” 

Seven laughed. “Yes — in a cem- 
etery.” 

“He explained that. Again the ex- 
planation is caught up in myth. His 
god, or gods, are supposed to re- 
visit the planet some day and take 
up all the spirits; when they left 
thousands of years ago, they prom- 
ised they would come a second 
time. This second visitation is sup- 
posed to be a universal reawaken- 
ing day, and the old leader sleeps 
in the midst of the dead so that he 
will not be overlooked when that 
day comes. It is the release he is 
expecting.” 

“Release from eternal life? That 
is a favor?” 

Two cut in dryly, “Try it some- 
time.” 

“I might, if I get the chance,” 
GALAXY 



116 



Seven agreed. “How did the old 
boy manage it?” 

“I don’t know how it really hap- 
pened,” Nineteen said. “But ac- 
cording to his mythology, he ang- 
ered the gods by rejecting peace 
and was sentenced to live until 
they came again. The gods won’t 
permit his death until that day. I 
wish I could get to the truth of the 
matter!” 

^T^HE king of the planet heard 
the starship go. It quit the sky 
with a repetition of the thunder 
which had accompanied its arrival, 

★ 



and after its passing the world was 
strangely quiet. 

It was always like that after a 
big ship had passed, but presently 
the night sounds would return and 
the lonely world would be normal 
again. In a century or so, or p>erhaps 
three, or five, another ship would 
come and more visitors would de- 
scend on him, annoying him, ques- 
tioning him, taunting him. 

Without realizing it, they always 
taunted him. 

For none of them was the one 
visitor he awaited.

FORECAST 



""Don't stop experimenting with your forecast," we are commanded by 
our readers, and we're not stopping. With a giant 1 96 pages to move around 
in, we enjoy the exciting combinations made possible, so why should we stop? 

Always a novella or serial to lead off with? 

Why? 

How, instead, about a great clutch of novelets? For instance, THE 
UNDETECTED by George O. Smith, whose mastery has taken a huge leap for- 
ward; you'll find here a pulse-pounding duel the like of which has never been 
in print before. And PROSPECTOR'S SPECIAL by Robert Sheckley; lost in the 
vast Scorpion Desert of Venus, he needs all the courage a man can own — 
and every bit of credit he can raise! And a newcomer, A. J. Offutt, who ought 
to appear here more often, with BLACKSWORD; being a live-wire political 
scientist, he needs just one good connection — to get high-voltage power out 
of a single hot lead! 

And more. Don't be too aghast if you find just under half a dozen 
novelets in the issue. 

That leaves room for short stories, those vital smaller items that can be 
read in a quick break of one sort or another. But, we promise, no artificially 
padded contents page. 

Willy Ley, off on a data-gathering hunt, won't reveal the title of his 
upcoming science article until he has the whole thing in hand. Says it's highly 
interesting, and that is all we can get out of him as of even date. Now what 
the devil can it be? Can hardly wait to find out .

H ESKETH knew the cell so 
well, it was almost a part 
of him. But then there 
wasn’t very much of it to know. 

From floor to ceiling, it mea- 
sured seven feet; from end to end, 
it measured seven feet; from side 
to side, it measured seven feet. In 
this harshly symmetrical volume, 
there were two acceleration bunks 
with straps, and a sort of sink that 
had two disparate uses. Once there 
had also been a radio transmitter 
with a subspace call key, but that 
had been removed so long ago that 
even the mark on the wall where 
it had been attached had faded into 
invisibility. 

In fact, as Hesketh was still 
capable of remembering when he 
turned his mind to the subject, 
which was seldom, it was an exact 
copy of the interior of a survival 
capsule. Or maybe — for the Char- 
nogs were of an economical turn 
of mind — it was the interior of a 
survival capsule. Hesketh had more 
important things on his mind than 
such fiddling distinctions. 

The Charnog who should have 
fed him was late. 

It had never happened before, 
and his stomach, conditioned to an 
unvarying routine, was beginning 
to grumble. Patiently, he sat down

119 



on the edge of the bunk he always 
used in preference to the other 
(though there was no difference 
between the two). But the strange- 
ness of the occurrence disturbed 
him. 

IV ORMALLY, his mind gave 

’ him no trouble these days. The 
flow of his thoughts moved as 
steadily as water through a smooth- 
ly turned pipe. But now he found 
an emotion forming: a wish tnat 
they would come and feed him so 
he could go to sleep on a full 
stomach. 

The idea of doing something 
about it, of course, didn’t enter his 
head. There wasn’t anything he 
could do about it. 

An imaginary itch started on 
his back, and he contorted himself 
to scratch it When that distraction 
had grown dull, he found himself 
shivering, and that was odd. The 
clothes he had had on when he was 
first brought here had long ago be- 
come unwearable through much 
scrubbing, but the Charnogs liked 
a warm climate and he had never 
been cold. 

They had allowed him to keep 
the calendar watch on his wrist 
when he was caught, once they had 
found he had no time sense of his 
own, but the unchanging pace of life 
in his tiny room had keyed him to 
a routine where he no longer 
glanced at the dial. He did so now, 
and had to knit his brows to re- 



member what position of the hands 
corresponded to feeding time. 

Whatever it was, it wasn’t the 
one now showing. 

Finally he got up and went to 
the door, pressing his ear against it. 
He knew there was a passage there, 
partly because he might well have 
seen it when he was brought here, 
though he no longer remembered 
that period very clearly, and partly 
because he had heard the slither- 
ing progress of Charnogs go from 
end to end of it more times than 
he could count. 

There was a noise out there now. 

But it was not the noise of a 
Charnog. 

It was a cautious noise, with a 
sort of irregular double beat to it, 
and it sounded as though it was 
made by something large and very 
clumsy. It awoke things in Hes- 
keth’s brain which had lain dormant 
for too long, and his shivering be- 
came uncontrollable. 

He sat down again on the bunk 
and clutched himself to preserve 
his body heat. This noise, it oc- 
curred to him, must have some- 
thing to do with his food being late, 
and he felt a dull resentment. 

After a time, whatever was mak- 
ing the noise came to his door and 
stopped. There were fumbling 
sounds from the region of the catch 
on the outside of the sliding panel; 
then there were impatient move- 
ments and something white-hot 
and sizzling seared through the 



120 



GALAXY 



lock and burned a track down the 
opposite wall. Hesketh leaped to 
his feet and turned to run. 

There was nowhere to run to. 

“Well, I’ll be damned and blast- 
ed!” A bellowing voice hurt his 
ears. “A man!" 

C LOWLY Hesketh faced the 
armored and helmeted figure 
in the doorway. It had been a long 
time since he used words, but his 
mind filtered the essential mean- 
ing out of what had been said. 

“Man,” he repeated to himself, 
and though his voice sounded 
rusty, the actual noise seemed sat- 
isfactory. He managed a complete 
sentence. “Yes, I’m a man.” 

“Well, I’m damned!” the new- 
comer said again. He took a pace 
back and sent a giant shout echo- 
ing down the passage. Then he held 
out his hand. 

But Hesketh had forgotten what 
to do with it. 

The stranger shrugged, exposed 
his teeth and pushed back his hel- 
met. Sniffing distorted his face, and 
he spoke in the same bellowing 
voice. “Boy, I bet you’re glad to see 
me! My name’s Walters — Second 
Consolidation Fleet. We got the 
Charnogs out of this sector today 
and we’re taking a look at what 
we’ve got. How long have you been 
in this stinking hole, anyway? No, 
don’t answer that — you probably 
don’t know.” 

“My name is Hesketh,” said the 



prisoner very quietly, not attempt- 
ing to imitate the other’s shouting. 
“And I do know how long I have 
been here. I have been here twenty- 
eight years, two months and seven- 
teen days.” 

Now other men were gathering 
in the passage, weapons cautiously 
at the ready, to exclaim with wond- 
er in the same high monotonous 
roar. Hesketh, during the whole 
period of his captivity, had heard 
no noise except his own feet pad- 
ding in his cell, the splash of water 
and the slither of Charnogs. He had 
forgotten how loud a human voice 
could be. So far as he could, he shut 
his ears to the babble. 

They brought him clothing and 
a spacesuit, and somehow he got 
them on, thinking of the outside, 
the universe that had been a dim- 
ming memory for twenty-eight 
years. But it was still unreal beside 
the discomfort in his stomach. 

When they led him out into the 
passage, he looked around eagerly, 
hoping to see his bowl lying beside 
one of the dead Charnogs that 
littered the floor. Walters noticed 
his actions and grinned. 

“Good to see them getting a bit 
of their own back, hey, Hesketh?” 
he asked loudly. 

Hesketh shook his head; that 
gesture came back automatically. 
“No, I’m hungry.” 

“Starved you, did they, as well 
as penning you up? The bastards! 
Well, as soon as we get you aboard 



SILENCE 



121 



a ship, you’ll be properly looked 
after.” 

Hesketh was going to explain 
that he wasn’t starving. It was just 
that these people had ruined the 
Charnogs’ careful arrangements for 
looking after him. But at that point 
he was hustled into a cramped 
compartment which shot suddenly 
up, adding another discomfort to 
that of hunger. Then the door of 
the compartment opened, and they 
were on the surface of a night-dark 
plain. 

Big, brilliant stars leaped out 
of a deep heaven and struck at 
Hesketh’s mind. A distant horizon 
jarred his eyes into a focus they 
hadn’t used all the time he was in 
his seven-by-seven-by-seven cell. 

It was no wonder he blacked out. 

I ^ HE doc’s given him a good 
intravenous meal, so he 
should be strong enough when he 
wakes up. Still, the shock must 
have been pretty considerable. 
When you’ve resigned yourself to 
dying a prisoner, I guess it’s an uf}- 
setting experience to be rescued.” 

That was Walters’ voice. It was 
the familiar timbre more than the 
actual words which caught Hes- 
keth’s attention as he struggled 
back to consciousness. While the 
next voice took up the thread, he 
paid it very little attention, except 
to try to work out where it differed 
from Walters’. 

“Especially after all this time,” 



the second speaker agreed. “I’ve 
never heard of a similar case. I sent 
someone to look through the casu- 
alty lists about that time, but he 
drew a blank on the service list, 
and I haven’t much hope from the 
civilian side — speak of the devil. 
Thanks, Lai.” 

Something rustled, and the voice 
went on. 

“Yes, this looks like it! Abdul 
Hesketh, reported missing from 
transport 62965, just under thirty 
years ago. And what’s more — ” 

“Civilian intelligence!” said 
Walters excitedly “Not only do 
we get someone back from the 
Charnogs — we get someone who’s 
really in a position to tell us some- 
thing about them! This is a stroke 
of luck, isn’t it, sir?” 

“I think he’s waking up,” said 
the other voice warningly, and 
Hesketh remembered that his eye- 
lids had flickered a moment before. 
The light had been blindingly yel- 
low compared to the bluish-tinted 
Charnog illumination he was used 
to, but he had seen that the room 
was clean-looking and large, and 
his nose told him it smelled dif- 
ferent from his cell. 

A hospital, he remembered. 
That’s right — a hospital. 

“Are you feeling all right now, 
Hesketh?” Walters asked. 

Hesketh wet his lips. “Yes,” he 
answered, and managed to get his 
eyes open and keep them op>en. 
Walters’ face loomed large beside 



122 



GALAXY 



the bed. Another man, heavier- 
faced, was beside him. 

“This is Commodore Vozhdov,” 
Walters explained. “He was direct- 
ing the raid that got you away from 
the Charnogs.” 

Vozhdov smiled. “Well, Hes- 
keth, you’re about the luckiest man 
in history, you know. We were just 
saying we’d never heard of any- 
one being rescued from the Char- 
nogs before. You’ve had a pretty 
rough time, but that’s over.” 

' “It wasn’t so bad,” said Hesketh. 
The commodore’s voice, like all the 
others, was too loud and grated 
on his ears. “I got fed, and I was 
warm enough, and they let me have 
water to wash in.” 

“But they kept you coop>ed up 
in that tiny room for twenty-eight 
years!” Walters protested. “That’s 
— that’s inhuman!” 

“Charnogs aren’t human,” Hes- 
keth pointed out. 

Vozhdov recovered from that 
one the quicker of the two. “Of 
course they’re not,” he agreed 
soothingly. “Well, I guess the first 
thing you’ll want to do is to find 
out what’s happened all the time 
you’ve been a prisoner. Nothing 
much, I’m sorry to say — touch and 
go, give and take, pretty much a 
stalemate. Thanks to you, though, 
I expect victory, and in damned 
short order!” 

“Thanks to me?” Hesketh was 
confused; abstracts like the con- 
cept of victory troubled him. 
SILENCE 



“Well, no other man has ever 
been in such a favorable position 
to study the Charnogs,” Walters 
pointed out. “And you were in 
civilian intelligence, weren’t you, 
before you — uh — before your 
capture?” 

Hesketh said nothing. He 
frowned a little. 

“We aren’t going to get very far 
with this at the moment,” said 
Vozhdov, addressing Walters. “But 
as soon as Doc gives the okay, I 
want him brought around to me, 
and we’ll bring him up to date on 
what’s happened. I figure the 
sooner he starts leading a normal 
human life again, the more help 
he’ll be.” 

Hesketh shut his eyes. 

I HE doctor’s name was Shu; he 
-*■ was small, rather dingy of com- 
plexion and soft of voice. That 
alone made Hesketh prepared to 
like him better than Vozhdov or 
Walters, and he obediently agreed 
to being shaved and examined. 

There were other people, but 
they made no direct impact on him. 
Once he had seen his own face in 
the mirror, and been surprised to 
find how much it resembled theirs, 
he gave up trying to remember the 
differences between their features. 
They seemed as impersonal as the 
many machines Shu employed to 
test his nervous reflexes, to ascer- 
tain his metabolic level, to study 
the pattern of his encephalograms. 



123 



The green hospital gowns were 
soothing. But the hard surface table 
— much harder than his familiar 
acceleration bunk — was uncom- 
fortable, and the atmosphere of 
detachment irked him, so that he 
was almost glad when Shu finally 
turned off the current from the last 
of the machines and looked directly 
at him. 

“You’re all right,” he said quietly. 
“At least, you’re in better shape 
than anyone would have expected. 
You’re confused, naturally, and 
your reflexes are slow, but physi- 
cally you’re as fit as I am.” 

Hesketh didn’t speak, and Shu, 
after hesitating a moment, crossed 
the room to his desk communicator. 
“Lieutenant Walters, please,” he 
said, and drummed with his fingers 
on the desk until he was answered. 

The shock of hearing Walters 
speak made Hesketh look around 
and expect to see him; then he re- 
membered and relaxed. A little. 

“Walters, if you’d like to come to 
sick quarters — Commodore Vozh- 
dov wanted you to take Hesketh 
to him.” 

“Be there in just a moment,” said 
Walters. 

While waiting, Hesketh looked 
at the apparatus the doctor had 
used. It was disturbing. It wasn’t so 
much that it was unfamiliar; rather, 
it was in some way too familiar. 

He was almost glad when Wal- 
ters turned up, hearty and loud- 
voiced as before. He followed with- 



out protest and without trying to 
remember the way they took, as 
Walters led him down corridors 
and into and out of elevators, until 
they arrived in a large office whose 
walls were almost p>ap>ered with 
communicators and information 
lights. Here, at an administrator’s 
desk, sat Vozhdov. 

“Mr. Hesketh to see you, sir,” 
Walters said. 

The commodore shot a file of 
papers into a pass-to-you and 
swung around in his seat. He indi- 
cated chairs. Hesketh sat uncom- 
fortably, because his was a good six 
inches higher than the acceleration 
bunks he was used to. 

“Well, you’ve become a pretty 
important man, Mr. Hesketh,” 
Vozhdov began, frowning. “I re- 
ported your rescue to headquarters 
and it is anxious to know every- 
thing you can tell us as soon as 
possible. Of course, we’ll have to 
have it all analyzed eventually, but 
it’ll be two weeks before we get 
you to a proper set of computers, 
so we’ll have to make the best of 
what we’ve got.” 

“I don’t understand,” said Hes- 
keth. 

OZHDOV seemed genuinely 
” surprised. “No? I thought it 
was clear enough. Look at it this 
way: never before have we actu- 
ally got someone back from Char- 
nog custody — someone who’s ob- 
served them at first hand. Direct 



124 



GALAXY 



information about them is worth 
hauling a Class B cruiser out of 
the battle line and sending it back 
to Base under emergency over- 
drive. Which is what we’ve done. 
Because of you—” Vozhdov glanced 
at his watch — “four thousand-odd 
fighting men and one of the second 
most powerful ships in our fleet 
are heading away from a devel- 
oping battle, and have been for 
eighteen hours. Maybe you see now 
how important you are.” 

“This ship?” said Hesketh. Then 
he added hastily, not wanting to 
appear foolish, “It is a ship, isn’t 
it, not a planetary base?” 

Vozhdov was momentarily at a 
loss for words. With a glance at 
him, Walters filled the breach. 

“Things have changed quite a 
bit since your day, Hesketh,” he 
said. “It is a ship, of course. Since 
we got the Sun Ping drive twenty 
years ago, there’s just about no 
limit to what we can put aloft. We 
could move planets around, I 
guess, if we wanted.” 

Hesketh didn’t respond. Walters 
made a grimace and shrugged. 

“All right,” said Vozhdov heav- 
ily. “You know what your knowl- 
edge means to us, Hesketh. You’re 
the one thing that’s better than a 
live Charnog for our purposes. 
You’re unique. You’re invaluable. 
You’re indispensable. Under- 
stand?” 

Hesketh, feeling it was expected 
of him, nodded. Then he said. 



“Well — ” and tried desperately to 
think of something he could say 
about his captors. “They slither,” 
he suggested hopefully. “I used to 
hear them going down the passage 
outside when they fed me.” 

“Yes, we know they slither,” 
agreed Vozhdov patiently. “We’ve 
deduced that much from studying 
their anatomy. But that’s not what 
we want. We can’t keep a Charnog 
alive in captivity long enough to 
study its way of thinking — its psy- 
chology, in short. And we need bad- 
ly to know about that.” 

“They kept me warm,” said 
Hesketh. “It was warmer there 
than it is here. And they gave me 
water in the sink in the corner. 
There was a tap I had to turn.” 
“That’s interesting. They must 
have had to develop a new tech- 
nique for that,” said Walters slow- 
ly. “We know water’s corrosive to 
them. But I guess we must have 
know that for fifty years.” 

Vozhdov snorted. “All right. 
Fact one: they went to a lot of 
bother to keep Hesketh alive. But 
we could have guessed that from 
the fact that he’s here now. Any- 
thing else?” 

“How about air?” asked Walters. 
“Yes, there was air,” said Hes- 
keth. “How else do you think I 
could have breathed?” 

W ALTERS wasn’t used to hear- 
ing anyone address a commo- 
dore in that manner; he looked

righteous and indignant Vozhdov 
glared at him and sp>oke patiently 
to Hesketh. “How was the air pro- 
vided?” 

Hesketh shrugged. “It was al- 
ways there. I don’t know where it 
came from. I couldn’t look.” 

“They probably piped him in 
oxygen through the old storage 
tank inlet” said Walters. “But that 
was all. I got a whiff of the atmos- 
phere in that room, sir. It stank!” 

“And we were flushing the tun- 
nels with oxygen, anyway, to kill 
off the survivors.” Vozhdov grunt- 
ed. “They fed you, too, didn’t 
they?” 

“Yes. Regularly.” Hesketh’s 
stomach was still upset. He put 
emphasis on the second word. 

“Ah!” said Vozhdov. “How 
often? Maybe from that we can 
deduce the rotation period of their 
home world. That could be valua- 
ble.” He looked at Hesketh ex- 
pectantly. 

“Every twelve hours,” said Hes- 
keth. “Exactly, every twelve 
hours.” 

^■''HE other two slumped in dis- 
appointment. 

“They must have noted 
the rotation period of the watch 
he had on him,” Walters com- 
plained. “I saw it was still going 
when we brought him aboard. 
Hadn’t gained or lost more than a 
few minutes, at the most, in all 
those years.” 



“Which had it done?” demanded 
Vozhdov. 

Walters looked apologetic. “Sor- 
ry, sir. I did notice, as it happens — 
compared it with my own. It had 
lost eight minutes and a few sec- 
onds.” 

“Mm. Well, I suppose the mere 
fact he was allowed to keep his 
watch is something,” Vozhdov al- 
lowed grudgingly. “Anything else, 
Hesketh?” 

“No, I can’t think of anything.” 

“You mean you were taken 
straight to that place immediately 
you were captured, and they left 
you locked in and never so much 
as looked at you again?” By the 
time Vozhdov finished, he was al- 
most shouting; Hesketh’s new ad- 
justment to ordinary voice levels 
gave way, and he barely heard the 
last few words. 

“That can’t be right, sir,” said 
Walters. “As I recall, there’s a gap 
of about seven months between his 
ship being reported missing and 
the time he says his captivity start- 
ed. He couldn’t have been in the 
survival capsule all that time. His 
supplies, even allowing for the 
fact that he was on his own, would- 
n’t have lasted him past a month, 
or six weeks at the ouside. And he 
was quite definite about the time 
he’d been in the cell, and his watch 
was working.” 

“Okay, Mr. Hesketh,” said Vozh- 
dov bluntly. “What happened to 
you in those seven months?” 



126 



GALAXY 



rjESKETH frowned. “I don’t 
remember,” he said. “If was 
a long time ago.” 

“Well, surely you remember 
how you ipt there?” 

“Oh, yes! When the ship blew 
up, I got into the capsule. I was 
lucky.” 

“That’s not when your luck start- 
ed!” said Walters bitterly. “It 
started when I blew the lock on 
your cell!” 

“Lieutenant!” said Vozhdov 
sharply, and Walters subsided, 
looking mutinous. “Mr. Hesketh, 
we appreciate you’ve been through 
a great ordeal, believe me. We 
realize we’re asking a lot of you. 
But it’s only because you have a 
lot to give. It’s of the utmost im- 
portance to your race that you 
should remember.” 

“It was a long time ago.” 

“This is like talking to the air!” 
said Vozhdov. “What did Shu say 
about this, Walters?” 

“He said Hesketh was in re- 
markably good shape, all things 
considered.” 

“Well, take this man back with 
my compliments and inform Dr. 
Shu that he didn’t consider every- 
thing. I’ve promised victory— prac- 
tically — on the strength of getting 
this prisoner back, and I’m going 
to look pretty silly if we’re wasting 
our time. And so are you.” 

Walters got up and beckoned 
that Hesketh should do the same, 
and they retraced their steps to 



the hospital. Walters did not talk 
during the trip; he merely strolled 
along looking as if he could see a 
citation for distinguished service 
retreating from him under over- 
drive. 

“Well, Doc?” Walters inquired. 
“Do you think the Charnogs man- 
aged to get into his mind and seal 
it off?” 

“I doubt it,” said the quiet little 
doctor, when he had finished check- 
ing Hesketh briefly. “What’s more 
likely is that during his captivity 
he has repressed some unpleasant 
memories. I think the commodore 
is trying to rush matters. Give him 
a day or two to get used to the idea 
that he’s human and not complete- 
ly alone. Then some of the^arriers 
may break down.” 

“So what do you recommend 
we do?” 

Shu chewed his lower lip for a 
moment. “Why not show him the 
ship and introduce him to as many 
of the crew as possible? And you 
might — but warn me before you 
do this you might take him to a 
survival capsule and show him that 
it’s not really a Charnog p>rison 
cell, but a means of escape.” 

“Doctor,” said Hesketh sudden- 
ly, “is there somewhere I could be 
alone for a bit?” 

“Yes, certainly,” Shu nodded. 
“I’ve assigned you a cabin right 
next door to sick quarters. Number 
42 1. Come along and I’ll show you 
where it is. My office is just a

couple of doors along, so if you 
need me at any time, you only have 
to look in, and if I’m not there, 
one of the orderlies will be. You 
see, this is — ” 

Hesketh went into the cabin and 
closed the door. 

“Well, I’ll be damned!” ex- 
claimed Walters. “He doesn’t even 
seem grateful that we hauled him 
out of that hole!” 

“We probably haven’t given him 
much to feel grateful for, so far,” 
said Shu mildly. “Don’t rush him. 
It’s a miracle that he’s as sane as 
he is, you know.” 

“Well, you’re the expert,” said 
Walters. “All right.” 

^ I ' HE cabin wasn’t bad. There 
was only one bunk, but it was 
on the correct side for his taste, and 
there were a sink and a chair. The 
bunk was too high, but he didn’t 
notice that once he had sunk down 
on it, for he fell immediately into a 
deep sleep. 

He woke up again for no reason 
except that a period of time had 
passed, went to the sink, and lay 
down again. But something nagged 
him. Finally it clarified into the 
fact that his stomach was empty. 

He swung his feet to the floor 
and gazed expectantly at the door 
panel, submerging the knowledge 
that there was a reason for his food 
not arriving. He had been waiting 
like a statue for a long time when 
there was a rap at the door. 

128 



He didn’t move, because nothing 
else hapi>ened. 

After a moment, the panel slid 
aside, and Walters stepped through. 
On seeing Hesketh, he heaved a 
sigh of relief. 

“So you are here!” he said. “We 
were getting worried. The doc said 
he hadn’t seen you for hours—” 

“I’m hungry,” said Hesketh 
flatly. 

“Well, of course you must be. 
You’ve been alone in here for hours. 
Come along with me to mess and 
I’ll introduce you to the rest of us.” 

“All right,” said Hesketh, and got 
up. 

As he stood aside to let Hesketh 
precede him, Walters caught sight 
of the sink by the door, and had to 
swallow hard before speaking 
again. “Uh — the proper place — 
didn’t anybody tell you—? Never 
mind. This way.” 

The mess was full of people: 
faces all very much alike except for 
minor differences of coloring, names 
all very different. The combination 
defeated Hesketh, and the curious 
soon tired of staring at him. 

They sat him at a table and 
brought a white dish containing a 
variety of multi-colored objects. He 
ignored it at first; it was different in 
both smell and appearance from 
what the Charnogs had given him. 

“I thought you said you were 
hungry,” said Walters in surprise, 
and Hesketh, copying the actions 
of others sitting not far from him, 
GALAXY 



took something from the plate 
which looked less outrageous than 
the rest and stuffed it into his 
mouth. The taste was unpleasant, 
but he got it down. 

“Something— to drink?” he asked 
Walters, who was watching his ac- 
tions with unconcealed wonder. 

Walters brightened, and signaled 
a mess waiter. 

“This’ll make you feel better,” 
he said when the man produced a 
bottle. “It’s about the best we’ve 
got. All the way from Earth.” 

Something pale yellow and 
translucent arrived in a glass set 
before Hesketh. After a pause, he 
picked it up doubtfully. “This— this 
isn’t water,” he said. 

“You darned right it’s not! That’s 
our best white wine. Try it — it’s 
good.” Walters leaned forward en- 
couragingly. 

Sickly, Hesketh set the glass 
down. How to explain that in his 
personal cosmos there was only one 
fluid at all besides water, and that 
it was this color? “No, I haven’t 
drunk anything but water for — for 
a long time. Maybe I’d better not” 

ALTERS looked relieved to 
^ And there was an apparently 
rational explanation for Hesketh’s 
peculiar actions. 

“I guess you may be right at 
that” he agreed. “That stuff is 
pretty strong. All right, waiter — a 
glass of water instead.” 

The food quieted Hesketh’s 
SILENCE 



stomach and he got through the 
meal without further difficulty. 
Then Walters took him off for a 
tour of the ship. 

“How about starting with the 
drive room?” he suggested, and so 
they started with the drive room 

— a vast place full of tame energies 
that slept and sometimes crackled 
into wakefulness in gigantic insu- 
lated spheres. 

“That’s the Sun Ping drive, of 
course,” said Walters. “Like I told 
you, it could move planets if we 
wanted it to.” 

Then they went to armaments. 
“There’s a Charnog name 
stamjjed on every one of these mis- 
siles,” said Walters, “if they use 
names. Do they?” 

“I don’t think they talk,” said 
Hesketh, “so they probably don’t 
have names.” 

Walters shrugged. “Comes to the 
same thing in the end.” 

Then they went to navigation. 
“Charnog bases,” said Walters, 
indicating a sweep of lights across 
an astral map. They glowed dan- 
ger-red. “We’ve established the lo- 
cation of practically every base in 
this sector now. Far cry from your 
day, eh, Hesketh? Then we were 
practically fighting in the dark.” 
“Which — where was I?” 

“Here,” said Walters, and tapped 
a green light. “That’s been green 
ever since the day we rescued you. 
Pretty soon now, they’ll all be green 

— with your help.” 



129 



“Take me back to my cabin, 
please,” said Heskefh. 

“Let’s finish our tour,” Walters 
said, and dragged Hesketh off to 
the servicing shops, and the admin- 
istrative section, and the troop 
landing locks, and the planetary 
boat section, and the recreation 
rooms, and . 

Hesketh lost count 
Eventually he found himself 
back in Vozhdov’s office, and the 
heavy-faced officer was throwing 
questions at him. 

“You already asked me that,” 
said Hesketh firmly. “I told you I 
couldn’t remember.” 

Vozhdov frowned and sent for 
Dr. Shu. 

“This is getting us nowhere,” he 
declared in anoyance. 

Shu shook his head. “Commo- 
dore, put yourself in his position. 
For twenty-eight years, Hesketh 
has had to think of himself as a 
unique individual. You can’t expect 
him to re-establish racial identifi- 
cation all at once. His subconscious 
hasn’t been troubled with problems 
of survival in all this time. Even- 
tually it will come to equate per- 
sonal advantage with racial advan- 
tage again, and then we’ll see the 
barriers begin to crumble.” 

’!/■ OZHDOV turned to Walters. 
^ “Has he made any friends yet 
among the crew?” 

Walters grimaced. “I don’t think 
he’s interested. I doubt if he gives 
130 



a damn even about me.” 

“I was thinking that by this time 
he would at least have started to 
identify,” Shu muttered. “Still, this 
is a unique case—” 

“I suppose he does know some- 
thing of value to us?” Vozhdov put 
in. 

“Almost certainly,” said Shu. 
“After all, in those missing seven 
months, you can bet your life the 
Charnogs were doing their utmost 
to get the information they wanted 
out of him. So—” 

“Do you think they got it?” 
Vozhdov cut in. 

“Possibly.” Shu shrugged. “In 
which case, there may be a subcon- 
scious element of guilt involved. If 
he was aware he was being useful 
to the enemy, he may regard him- 
self as a traitor. Such an idea is cer- 
tainly repulsive enough to account 
for the repression of his memories.” 
“But surely we have the tech- 
niques to eliminate repressions of 
that kind?” Walters commented. 

Shu gave a vigorous nod. “Of 
course! But to try and break down 
his mental armor by force would 
remove the props on which his sta- 
bility depends now. He’s had a long 
time to get used to them, remem- 
ber. We might find ourselves with 
an insane man on our hands.” 

“So we go on waiting,” said 
Vozhdov. 

“Exactly.” 

Into the silence which followed 
that remark broke a small but in- 
GALAXY 



sistent buzz. Vozhdov flipped a 
switch on his desk. 

“Listening.” 

“Unidentified vessel on approach 
course at extreme limit of detector 
range, sir,” said an impersonal 
voice. “Fifteen forward by eight 
down by a hundred and six. I’m 
putting a plot of the course on your 
screen.” 

A brilliant blue curve sprang into 
life on a plastic plate inset in the 
desk top; Vozhdov studied it for a 
moment and said, “Action stations 
yellow.” Then, over his shoulder to 
the others, “Get out of here.” 

They went. 

“You’d better nip along, Wal- 
ters,” said Shu. “I’ll take Hesketh 
with me. His cabin is close to sick 
quarters.” 

COMEWHERE in a tangle of 
twisting passages, they heard a 
PA speaker cough into life, and it 
said, “Hear this! Chamog cruiser on 
approach course, twelve forward by 
nine O five down by a hundred one. 
Action stations red.” 

Shu broke into a run and Hes- 
keth had to keep up. 

“What — what’s happening?” he 
gasped. 

“What do you think? On a 
course like that, it’s coming in to 
the attack, obviously.” Shu skidded 
agilely around a corner. “I hope it’s 
a small one. This far behind the 
front line, it probably is. Most like- 
ly a scout—” 

SILENCE 



Another sp>eaker boomed down 
another corridor: “Attack immi- 
nent! Attack imminent!” 

Something clicked in Hesketh’s 
mind and he stopped in his tracks. 
“Capsule,” he said under his breath. 
“Capsule — where’s a capsule?” 

On the last word, his voice rose 
to a cry, but Shu had gone around 
a corner, out of sight Hesketh’s last 
despairing wail was lost on the air. 

He stood at an intersection, turn- 
ing indecisively from one passage 
to another. His limbs and face 
trembled uncontrollably; sweat 
started out on his forehead and 
dripped into his eyes. 

There was a thump that shifted 
the entire ship on its longitudinal 
axis, and he lost his footing and 
keeled over. His head struck the 
hard square corner of the wall, and 
for a few minutes he lay uncon- 
scious. 

When he recovered, blood was 
mingling with the sweat in his eyes 
and his mind was clouded by an 
intolerable ache. He pulled him- 
self to his feet and looked around. 
Nothing seemed visibly changed; 
whatever damage that gigantic 
blow had done, it was not in this 
area. 

A number painted clearly on a 
door attracted his notice. There was 
a familiar look about it, and he re- 
membered he had a cabin, with a 
number. All these were in the seven 
hundreds and no use to him. Cabin 
42 1 — that was it. 



131 



Someone was coming at a run. 
He glanced in both directions, saw 
the owner of the pounding footsteps 
cross the corridor in which he stood. 

“Where’s cabin 421?” he yelled. 

The man barely paused in his 
haste. “Down three decks — blue 
companionway — third intersection 
— fifth right, third left!” 

And he was gone. 

Hesketh tried to order his con- 
fused memory of the man’s direc- 
tions. He started off at random, and 
after a few paces came to the blue 
companionway. He went down, 
clinging to the rail. 

Three intersections— or was that 
decks? 

Even the jumbled memories ran 
out on him before he came to the 
end of the companionway and it 
turned red. Spots danced before 
his eyes, sometimes shifting to 
make the outline of the figure 42 1 
and sometimes transposing them- 
selves into 412 or 214 and some- 
times just blurring his sight. His 
pulse was beginning to race, and 
from time to time the left-hand 
wall of the corridor he was follow- 
ing met him head on. 

Someone rounded a corner and 
bumped into him. “You all right, 
pal?” a voice queried. 

Desperately, Hesketh formed 
the words. “Cabin 42 1, please?” 

“Sick quarters? D deck, turn 
right and second left and it’s 
straight in front of you. Can’t miss 
it.” 



The man was gone. 

Hesketh wandered a little fur- 
ther. Someone else appeared. Hes- 
keth croaked his question: “Cabin 
421, please?” 

“This is four-one-two,” said the 
man, jerking his arm out He was 
wriggling his head into a battle- 
vision helmet and did not notice 
Hesketh’s condition. “But if you’re 
looking for Duhe, he’s at his post 
in gunnery right now.” 

STAGGERING, Hesketh tried 
^ the door the man had indi- 
cated. It was locked. Focusing his 
eyes with an effort, he made out 
that its number was 412, and turned 
indignantly to ask what the man 
had meant. But he was gone. 

“Hear this,” said the PA system 
again. “Damage report. We were 
hit astern of the pwrt nose gunnery 
compartment by a large resonator. 
It failed to vibrate and—” 

Realization of what the impact 
had meant burst in Hesketh’s mind. 
He stared wildly left and right for 
the red-painted door which indi- 
cated the entrance to a survival 
capsule, saw none, and crumpled 
into a ball, trying to drive the mem- 
ories newly awakening back into 
the depths of his mind. 

“—contained the damage,” con- 
tinued the PA system, unmindful 
of Hesketh. “The raider is falling 
astern and steering erratically after 
two direct hits. That is all.” 

Hesketh was still in his fetal po- 
GALAXY 



132 




SILENCE 



133 



sition when he heard slow footsteps, 
doubled, making heavy work of the 
going. He maneuvered his eyes cau- 
tiously. 

Two armored orderlies were ap>- 
proaching, bearing between them 
a stretcher on which lay a badly 
injured man, his blood staining his 
blanket. 

Getting to his feet unsteadily, 
Hesketh said, “Cabin 42 1, please?” 

The first of the orderlies gazed at 
him in astonishment. “Who the 
devil sent you down to sick quar- 
ters on your own feet in that state? 
Come along with us!” 

He fell in obediently behind 
them, but as they entered the hos- 
pital corridor, he caught sight of 
the number he had been hunting 
for and dashed past them. As soon 
as the cabin door was safely 
slammed behind him, he flung him- 
self face down on the bunk. 

What was happening to him? 
This giddiness, this racing pulse, 
profuse sweating, this feeling of — 
something — neither fullness nor 
emptiness nor pressure, unlike any 
sensation his stomach had given 
him in all those years? 

For endless ages, he lay with- 
out daring to move, moaning at in- 
tervals. Then the door opened and 
Dr. Shu stepped in, followed by a 
nurse carrying a sterilizer and 
dressings. 

“What’s up with you, Hesketh?” 
the doctor inquired. “My order- 
lies said you looked pretty bad.” 
134 



Hesketh half-rolled on his side 
and gave a gasp. It could have been 
a word: “Help!” 

Shu’s professional fingers 
searched the bloody scalp. “A 
scratch,” he said, and added to the 
nurse, “Doesn’t need a dressing. 
Just clean it up.” 

“My — my guts,” moaned Hes- 
keth, and Shu frowned. He took a 
culture disc from a sterile case and 
slapped it briskly on the skin of 
Hesketh’s forearm, took it away, 
slid it under the objective of a 
pocket diagnostician. He whistled. 

“Here, eat this,” he said, click- 
ing a pill from a dispenser. “It’ll put 
you right in no time. All you’ve got 
is a common cold. I suppose, being 
in a pretty sterile climate, you’ve 
lost a lot of your resistances. But 
a cold is all it is.” 

Hesketh got the tasteless pill 
down somehow, and Shu turned 
back toward the door. 

“Don’t leave me!” Hesketh 
begged. 

“Listen, Hesketh, I’ve got sixty 
men in sick quarters that we picked 
out of the wreck of the nose gun- 
nery section. I’ve done everything 
you need, and I can’t waste time 
holding your hand!” Then his face 
softened a bit. “I suppose it’s en- 
couraging that you don’t want to be 
alone any more. Don’t worry, that 
pill will fix you up in about six 
hours—” 

A voice bellowed through the 
door: Vozhdov’s. “Shu, what the 



GALAXY 



hell are you doing in there? You 
should be operating on Gurra 
Singh!” 

“Yes, Commodore,” said Shu, 
turning away again. “They’re put- 
ting him under anesthetic now.” 

¥TESKETH couldn’t remember 
the last time he had felt ill. 
Now the virus drove him swiftly 
into delirium and exhausted coma, 
from which he awoke much weak- 
ened and with his head buzzing 
with new memories. They made 
him cry out and open his eyes, to 
find an orderly standing by his bed. 

“You should be okay now, Mr. 
Hesketh,” the man said. “Will you 
come through and see the doc in 
his office, please?” 

“No,” said Hesketh, and turned 
over. 

Bewildered, the man withdrew, 
but in a few moments he was back, 
accompanied this time by Vozhdov 
and Shu. The commodore stood 
glowering in the background while 
the doctor carried out a perhaps 
deliberately undeft examination. 
Then he stepped back, peeling off 
sterile gloves. 

“He’ll do,” he said in a voice that 
sounded terribly tired. “Fever’s 
gone and the infection’s under con- 
trol.” 

“All right!” Vozhdov came for- 
ward. “You listening, Mister Hes- 
keth?” 

Hesketh made no reply. 

Vozhdov could contain himself 



no longer. “Whether you want to 
listen or not, you’re going to!” he 
exploded. “I’ve had just about all 
I can take from you! It’s no damn 
good thinking that just because 
you’re unique and important you 
can keep us hanging about for your 
private likes and dislikes. We’ve 
just lost forty good men to a Char- 
nog attack, and the doc’s fighting 
to keep a dozen more alive. You 
know enough about the Charnogs 
to win the war, and we’re going to 
win it regardless of what you want!” 
Shu was shaking his head tiredly, 
in a gesture of warning, but Vozh- 
dov turned fiercely on him. 
“Enough of that! Walters! Come in 
here instead of standing like a jack- 
ass in the passage! I told you to 
get this man interested in what was 
going on—” 

“Sir,” said Walters defensively, 
“I tried my best. I just couldn’t get 
through to him.” 

“Well, take him up and show him 
the corpses and the wreckage in 
nose gunnery! If that doesn’t re- 
mind him he’s a human being with 
a duty to his race, we’ll remind him 
the hard way! All right, Hesketh,” 
he finished in a lower tone, “get on 
your feet and go with Walters.” 
Blindly, but recognizing the au- 
thority in the tone, Hesketh did so. 

¥ T seems to me,” said Walters 
-*• bitterly, as they funneled up 
an access corridor half-blocked 
with scattered equipment, “you 

135 



SILENCE 



care more for the bastards who 
cooped you up than you do for your 
own sF>ecies! I knew these guys 
they’re hauling out of there frozen 
stiff and torn to pieces. They were 
good friends of mine. Look!” 
Walters caught the shoulder of a 
masked and armored man, swing- 
ing him around to show what he 
was bearing in his arms: a leg, a 
hand and a head that did not match 
each other. 

“Your friends the Charnogs did 
that, Hesketh — understand?” 

The armored man pulled away 
and went on down the corridor with 
his ghastly load. 

Watching him depart, Hesketh 
felt a stir of sickness again. “What 
— exactly — happened?” 

“That’s better. Come through the 
lock and I’ll show you.” 

There was a guard at the lock, 
which had been cut through the 
air-seal around the damaged sec- 
tion; Walters explained his mission, 
and they were allowed to pass. 
Through the headphones of a 
spacesuit, his voice sounded oddly 
unfamiliar to Hesketh, but he got 
his meaning. 

“See that big black thing in the 
middle of this mess?” 

Hesketh’s eyes were unused to 
sorting out the kind of confusion 
that faced them. He stretched out 
a hand and pointed at something 
big and black and sinister which 
hardly ix)ked out from the heaps of 
ruined equipment. “That?” 

136 



“That. A present from your 
friends. Understand? A resonator 
with power enough to scatter this 
ship across half Creation. If our 
damper screens hadn’t stopped it 
vibrating we’d have been blown to 
hell between our lines and the near- 
est support base. We’d have been 
dead ducks, and that includes you, 
and it would have been your pals’ 
doing. Get it?” 

Hesketh shifted uncomfortably. 
“It happened to me before,” he 
said. “That must have been before 
I was — before I was a prisoner . 
But don’t they have survival cap- 
sules any more?” 

He waited anxiously for Wal- 
ters’ reply. 

“Of course we have survival cap- 
sules. You’ll see ’em all over the 
ship. But they’re an anachronism. 
What would be the chance of get- 
ting to a capsule if a resonator that 
size actually went off? And it 
would take a ship like ours days to 
scour the area on the chance of 
finding someone alive — and you 
think they’re going to search for 
improbable survivors when the 
ships could be knocking down 
Charnogs? Don’t be a fool.” 

“I — I thought they could locate 
them by radio,” Hesketh suggested. 

“Oh, sure. But you have to get 
pretty near to a capsule before you 
can pick it up on a receiver, and 
in any case the shock of the blast 
often puts the radio out of action. 
No, a survival capsule’s a waste of 
GALAXY 



effort these days.” Walters changed 
the subject. “Well? Seen enough? 
Are you going to talk now?” 

“I don’t know what I can say,” 
pleaded Hesketh, and Walters 
made a disgusted gesture. 

“Then we’ll have to find out,” he 
said, and led the way back from the 
damaged area into the body of the 
ship. 

A S they were retracing their 
steps down a corridor, they 
passed a red-painted door, and Hes- 
keth, startled, halted to stare at it. 

“Yes, that’s a survival capsule,” 
Walters told him. “A two-man cap- 
sule like the one you got away in. 
You got away! Not like those poor 
guys in the gunnery section — 
they’re all fouled up with the 
wreckage, aren’t they?” 

Unhearing, Hesketh worked the 
control exfierimentally and the 
door slid open. He looked inside. 
The design was hardly changed 
from the one he had known; but 
then Walters had said capsules 
were an anachronism, and who 
bothers to improve an anachron- 
ism? 

“Satisfied?” said Walters biting- 
ly after a long pause. 

Hesketh closed the door again 
reluctantly. 

“Take me back to my cabin, 
please,” he requested, and Walters 
struck out down the passage toward 
sick quarters. But when Hesketh 
came within sight of cabin 42 1 and 
SILENCE 



started eagerly to it, he was sur- 
prised to find his arm gripped. 

“Not so fast,” said Walters be- 
tween his teeth. “You’re coming 
into the doc’s office first.” 

“But — why? I’m all right now — 
my cold’s gone—” Protesting, Hes- 
keth tried to struggle loose, but 
Walters was skilled at frog-march- 
ing, and willy-nilly Hesketh found 
himself being forced toward the 
doctor’s door. 

Inside, they found Vozhdov sit- 
ting beside the doctor’s desk, coun- 
tersigning forms as the doctor filled 
them in. They looked up when Wal- 
ters and Hfesketh came in. 

“Well?” Vozhdov demanded. 
“Did that straighten him up?” 
“Not that I can see, sir,” said 
Walters. “All he’s interested in is 
survival capsules.” 

“Womb retreat,” said Shu softly, 
and completed another form. “Hes- 
keth, down here we’ve been watch- 
ing men die while you’ve been out. 
These are their death certificates 
I’m making out. Does that mean 
anything to you?” 

“Please let me go to my cabin,” 
said Hesketh. “I feel all right now.” 
“That does it!” snapped Vozh- 
dov. “Shu, we’re not waiting. 
There’s knowledge in this man’s 
mind that we must have, and you’re 
going to get at it. That’s an order.” 
Shu looked too weary to protest. 
“Serov! Quincatlan!” Vozhdov 
called, and two orderlies hurried 
into the office. “Take this man 



137 



through to the operating theater. 
The doctor will tell you what to do 
with him.” 

Hesketh’s arms were pinioned, 
and he was forced across the floor 
to a different door from the one 
by which he had entered. As soon 
as he saw what was beyond, he be- 
gan to scream. But he was laid out 
on a hard surgical bench, and a 
needle pricked his arm. 

A certain calm came over him; 
he stopped screaming, and his pulse 
quietened. But, inside, he cowered 
away from his own eyes for fear of 
what they might be going to show 
him. 

Vozhdov took a chair and sat 
down close to the table. Shu gave 
quiet commands to his orderlies, 
who wheeled in machines and at- 
tached suction-cup terminals to 
Hesketh’s temples and scalp. 

“Why was he screaming?” asked 
Vozhdov. 

Shu passed a hand across his 
forehead. “I imagine it was because 
this is what happened to him be- 
fore.” 

“You mean when the Charnogs 
had him? Well, what difference can 
that make? This time he’s helping 
his own race, isn’t he?” 

“Logic like that doesn’t neces- 
sarily appeal to the subconscious,” 
said Shu, and there was something 
in his voice that suggested it might 
not appeal to him either. But he 
continued his preparations. 

A metronome with a tiny light 



glowing at the end of its vertical 
pendulum was set to ticking over 
Hesketh’s forehead, and the stimu- 
lus touched off another scream. 
And another. And another. 

A further prick of a needle and 
there was darkness. 

TTE awoke to find himself back 
on the bunk in his cabin, with 
Shu sitting asleep on a chair beside 
him. The shock of waking brought 
him bolt upright, staring wildly 
around for signs of the hypnotist’s 
equipment which had been used on 
him. 

The doctor stirred and opened 
his eyes. 

“Don’t worry, Hesketh. It’s over 
for the moment.” 

Hesketh relaxed, but his watch- 
ful eyes were on Shu’s face, like 
those of a trapped animal studying 
its captor. 

“I’m sorry,” Shu went on inade- 
quately, “but it has to be done. 
You’ve been screaming — did you 
know?” 

Hesketh realized his throat was 
raw and harsh. He tried to sF>eak 
and found it painful. 

“Drink this — it’ll ease the sore- 
ness,” Shu offered, and reached for 
a glass of white liquid standing on 
the edge of the sink. Hesketh took 
it warily, as if in no mood to trust 
it, but when he tried it, it did re- 
lieve the pain. 

He gave the glass back with a 
mutter of thanks. 



138 



GALAXY 



“I don’t like what we’re having 
to do,” Shu said. “Do you under- 
stand that? But — well, when the 
Charnogs captured you, they must 
have examined you, and studied 
you, and learned a lot from you. 
You couldn’t have helped it. The 
mere fact that you were a living, 
breathing human being told them 
perhaps more than they’d known 
before about us. By a million-to- 
one chance, we got you back safe- 
ly. And — ” He spread his hands 
helplessly. “I’d rather have left you 
alone till you came to of your own 
accord. It would have happened. 
But they say they need what you 
can tell us right away, and the com- 
modore has ordered me to—” 

“Is there going to be more?” 
asked Hesketh. 

“Yes, I’m afraid there is. We’re 
trying to locate the memories of a 
few short months a good many 
years ago, and you’ve hidden them 
from yourself so well, it may take 
quite a long time for us to find them 
all.” Shu found he could no longer 
face the burning intensity of Hes- 
keth’s gaze, and had to look at the 
blankness of the wall. 

The door opened; an orderly 
locked in and said, “Commodore 
Vozhdov’s compliments. Doctor, 
and he’s ready for another session.” 

“Did you tell him I said Hesketh 
wasn’t?” Shu replied without turn- 
ing his head. 

“Yes, sir. He said he was tired 
of waiting for Hesketh.” 

SILENCE 



“All right.” The doctor got to his 
feet. Hesketh was staring at him ac- 
cusingly. “Damn it, Hesketh! I wish 
there was another way!” 

“I know you do,” said Hesketh 
surprisingly. “Where’’s— Vozhdov?” 
“In the operating theater, I pre- 
sume.” Shu indicated that Hesketh 
should leave the cabin in front of 
him, and they went out. 

Vozhdov was indeed in the 
theater; he was pacing up and down 
impatiently. As the doctor entered, 
he snapped, “Where have you 
been? We’ve wasted enough time 
already on this!” 

Hesketh surveyed the room si- 
lently. It was as it had been be- 
fore. The metronome was ready to 
start its ticking above his forehead, 
driving him into a trance. Deliber- 
ately, he picked up the heavy ob- 
ject and threw it at Vozhdov. 

T T hit the commodore in the chest, 
and the blow was followed by a 
moment of total astonished silence. 
Then Vozhdov reacted. 

“Why, you treacherous little—” 
His fist was already swinging for 
Hesketh’s face when Shu leaped 
forward. He wasn’t quite quick 
enough; he took the full force of 
the blow and staggered back across 
the room, holding his shoulder 
where it had been struck. 

“If you do that again. Commo- 
dore,” he said as soon as he had 
mastered the pain, “I shall forward 
a confidential report on your be- 



139 




havior to Base and have you re- 
lieved of your command.” 

“What did you say?” the com- 
modore demanded incredulously. 

“You heard.” Shu rubbed his 
aching shoulder. “If necessary, I’ll 
have you certified psychologically 
unfit. I think the staff will uphold 
my ruling when I tell them you 
endangered the sanity of the most 
valuable man alive. Now do you 
think you’re going to be able to 
control yourself, or do I have to 
order you out of here?” 

“But—” Vozhdov seemed unable 
to believe his ears. “But you saw 
what he did!” 

“Of course I saw,” said Shu in 
icy, cutting tones. “And it was fully 
justified.” 

Hesketh, finally comprehending 
the situation, suddenly gave the 
little quiet-spoken doctor a smile. 
“I like you!” he said. 

Shu ■ managed a tired grin in 
response. “You aren’t going to like 
me much longer,” he answered. 
“Lie down, will you?” 

Hesketh hesitated, looking at 
Vozhdov. Scowling, the commo- 
dore composed himself enough to 
take his seat, and Hesketh climbed 
irresolutely on the table. 

Then the metronome was set go- 
ing and it all started again. 

He awoke this time to find him- 
self still in the theater. Vozhdov 
was speaking, rubbing his hands to- 
gether delightedly. 

“So we’re getting somewhere! I 
140 



told you we would, didn’t I?” 
Hesketh rolled his head to look 
at Shu, who wore a sick expression. 

“Yes, we’re getting somewhere,” 
the doctor admitted. “I’m not sure 
it’s very reassuring news, though.” 
“Doesn’t matter,” shrugged 
Vozhdov. “Base will be delighted 






to get it. It’ll upset them to learn 
they’ve been underestimating the 
Charnogs’ knowledge of human 
psychology for so long, but they 
need a bit of shaking up.” 

“Oh, go ahead and make your 
report,” said Shu. “There’ll prob- 
ably be a promotion to follow.” 



Vozhdov’s satisfied smile van- 
ished like frost in sunlight. “What 
did you say. Dr. Shu?” 

The doctor didn’t seem to hear, 
but went on as if to himself. “That 
is, if Hesketh gets to Base with his 
mind in one piece . 

He suddenly noticed that Hes- 


















P-'V-'-Xj V 



keth’s eyes were open, and hurried 
up to the table. “Here,” he said so- 
licitously, “take my arm and I’ll 
get you back to your cabin.” 
“Couldn’t you send an orderly 
for that?” asked Vozhdov. 

“I could,” said Shu, helping Hes- 
keth to the floor, and left it at that. 

S TUMBLING, Hesketh reached 
his bunk and collapsed onto it. 
Shu stood over him with pitying 
eyes. 

“They must have treated you 
damned badly,” he said. “Almost as 
badly as we’re going to . But 
then they had ignorance as an ex- 
cuse.” 

When he left, Hesketh lay still. 
He found he was beginning to re- 
member: a ticking bright thing at 
the edge of his field of vision — 
which was not Shu’s metronome; 
something attached to his scalp — 
which was not Shu’s encephalo- 
graph. He was recalling voices that 
had spoken to him, hard, hard to 
understand — artificial. 

When he slept, it was with night- 
mares. 

They came for him when he was 
barely awake, and after that things 
settled into a standard cycle : 
trance, wakening with his throat 
raw, a brief interlude of thinking 
consciousness, and a period of ob- 
livion which he reached for as 
blessed comfort. 

“How can he be so indifferent 
about the Charnogs, after what they 
142 



must have done to him?” demanded 
Vozhdov at the end of one of the 
sessions. 

“What good would hate have 
been to him for twenty-eight 
years?” said Shu. “He couldn’t do 
anything.” 

“He could at least have looked 
forward to escape.” 

“Escape! How long would you 
hang onto that hope?” 

“Well, why can’t he feel angry 
now that he has been rescued?” 
pressed the commodore, and Shu 
gave him a short, cold look. 

“He’s beginning to feel angry 
again, I assure you.” 

“Good!” said the commodore, 
and Shu saw that the point of the 
remark was lost on him. 

The sessions continued. Each 
one left a clearer mind in Hesketh’s 
head. As Shu had stated, he was be- 
ginning to feel angry again, but that 
wasn’t all. 

After a later session, he looked 
at the little doctor curiously. “You 
really don’t like doing this, do you?” 
he said with a hint of wonder in his 
voice. 

“I hate it,” said Shu passionately. 

“Don’t worry,” Hesketh said. “It 
won’t be going on much longer.” 

Surprised, Shu stared at him. 
“How can you tell? Are you begin- 
ning to remember consciously, as 
well as unconsciously? I wish you 
could — then we could just question 
you, instead of having to dig in 
your mind this way.” 



GALAXY 



“It won’t be much longer now,” 
repeated Hesketh, cursing himself 
for having already said too much. 
But he couldn’t stop himself. “I— 
I escaped twice, you know.” 

“Of course you did,” said Shu. 
“Once from the wreck of a ship and 
once from the Charnog base.” 
“No,” said Hesketh, and frowned. 
“That wasn’t escape, was it? When 
Walters came and got me, I mean.” 
“Strictly speaking, it wasn’t,” Shu 
agreed. “It was a rescue, not an 
escape.” 

“That’s what I meant,” said Hes- 
keth, and Shu looked puzzled. 

Yes, certainly, Hesketh thought 
to himself. I escaped twice. I really 
did escape twice. 

“Well,” said Shu at length, “how- 
ever long it takes now, the worst of 
it is over.” 

TTESKETH was perfectly well 
aware that the worst of it was 
over. But what remained was pretty 
bad, too, and without the new 
clarity that had overtaken his mind, 
he would have succumbed to what 
was done to him. As it was, he con- 
tinued to struggle, though he sub- 
mitted readily enough now to the 
continuing routine: trance, wake- 
fulness, slumber, trance . 

Progress grew very slow. Locked 
deep, deep in the lowest levels of 
Hesketh’s subconscious, were things 
which his mind had overlaid pro- 
tectively with layer upon layer of 
defensive repressions. Memories of 
SILENCE 



what had actually been done to him 
came back comparatively quickly, 
although they lacerated his mind 
in so doing, but what was hidden 
below them was much more impor- 
tant — memories of things he had 
himself done involuntarily, and of 
his reactions to them. 

Each recollection was unearthed 
more slowly than the previous one, 
and Vozhdov’s impatience grew 
daily. 

The time came when it flared up 
and he shouted at Shu. “We’re only 
two days from Base now and you 
still haven’t cleaned out that data 
in his mind! What are they going to 
say when they—” 

“Exactly,” said Shu, his eyes like 
steel. “You’re afraid Hesketh won’t 
earn you a promotion, after all. 
You’re afraid they may find your 
insistence on rushing matters has 
forever deprived the human race of 
the knowledge buried in Hesketh’s 
mind. It may have — I’m not quali- 
fied to say. But I do know this — if 
you keep on driving Hesketh the 
way you’ve done up to now, you’ll 
finish him!” 

Hesketh got stiffly off the surgi- 
cal table and came across to Shu, 
who looked almost on the verge of 
hitting the commodore. “It’s not as 
bad as that,” he said comfortingly. 
“It’s all over.” 

“What d’you mean?” Vozhdov, 
unsure of what reply to give to Shu, 
was pleased to switch the object of 
his attention. 



143 



Hesketh gave him a look of con- 
tempt and went on addressing the 
doctor. “There’s a way out of this. 
And you don’t want to go on, do 
you?” 

“If it hadn’t been for him,” said 
Shu, nodding at Vozhdov, “I’d 
never have started.” 

“That’s what I thought. Well, 
come along then. Let’s go to a life 
capsule.” 

Startled, Shu looked up. “You — 
you think maybe that kind of stim- 
ulus might bring your memory back 
completely now?” 

“It might,” said Hesketh cau- 
tiously. “Anyway, it’s a way out, 
isn’t it?” 

“I don’t quite follow you, but it’s 
worth trying. Anything but what 
the last session’s been like! Hes- 
keth, I’m sorry — I feel as if I’ve 
been flaying you alive.” 

“That’s all right,” said Hesketh. 
“It was his fault, not yours.” 
Vozhdov purpled, but Shu si- 
lenced him with a glare. “All right, 
Hesketh,” he said. “There’s a cap- 
sule not far from here, on C deck, 
which will do. Try anything 
once ...” - 

It's worked all right before, 
thought Hesketh. 

T hey left the office together, 
Shu leading, Hesketh next and 
Vozhdov sullenly bringing up the 
rear. Something had cleared in 
Hesketh’s mind; new knowledge, 
new purpose filled it. 

144 



They reached the capsule and 
he put his purpose to work. 

He had never lifted a hand 
against Vozhdov since the time he 
had thrown the metronome at him, 
though he had often wanted to. 
Now he did; he swung around and 
brought the edge of his hand to 
the commodore’s throat. The blow 
was as violent as he could make it. 
Vozhdov could not even cry out, 
for it smashed his larynx. 

“What-?” cried Shu. “What 
for?” 

Hesketh gazed at him in sur- 
prise. “I thought you understood! 
Well, it doesn’t matter. You will in 
a moment. Come on!” 

Shu didn’t move. They dared not 
delay, Hesketh realized— who knew 
who might come past and catch 
them? He had to act first and ex- 
plain later. 

So he struck the doctor apolo- 
getically under the ear, catching 
him as he slumped, and dragged 
him through the entrance into the 
survival capsule, laid him tidily on 
the bunk he didn’t want for himself, 
and then closed the door and acti- 
vated the expulsion switch. 

As soon as the capsule had been 
fired, Hesketh got up from the bunk 
where he had thrown himself and 
looked with satisfaction. He knew 
his surroundings so well that they 
were almost a part of him. In a 
sense, they were. 

There was only one thing which 
irritated him, and that was the 
GALAXY 



radio jutting from the wall. He 
tugged at it, but it was mounted too 
securely for him to dislodge it. 
He clambered onto one of the 
bunks and kicked downward at the 
radio. Wires fused as they tore 
loose. Then he sat down to await 
Shu’s awakening. 

In a few minutes, the little doc- 
tor stirred and moaned, and Hes- 
keth spoke reassuringly. “It’s all 
right now. Doc. Everything is all 
right.” 

Shu started up and looked 
around. 

“How could I have been so stu- 
pid?” he said wonderingly. “You, 
told me yourself you escaped 
twice! Once from the wreck of the 
transport ship, and once from the 



Charnogs — only the Charnogs re- 
captured you — and each time you 
came to equate escape with a sur- 
vival capsule. So you naturally 
made your third escape the same 
way, this time from us.” 

He began to laugh. “Well, every- 
thing’s clear now. You’re out of 
Vozhdov’s hands for good. Base’ll 
send out ships to pick us up. It 
won’t take them long to track down 
our radio signal.” 

“Oh, no,” Hesketh assured him, 
and fxjinted to the ruins of the 
radio. “That was the mistake I 
made both times, letting the caf>- 
sule go on signaling. You didn’t 
think I’d make it a third time, did 
you?”

THE ENEMY STARS by Foul

Unfortunately, Anderson is not in

In truth. The Enemy Stars is 
more a descendant of Melville and

Why did men go to sea and why

good that, if not for some loose ends

Asimov. Doubleday & Co., Inc., 
N.Y., $3.50 

WITH THIS admirable volume, 
eminent biochemist Asimov is well 
into his second score of published 
books. 

Even though he is amazing- 
ly prolific for a writer with a steady 
job, few other authors can claim 
his consistently high level of excel- 
lence. 

Two pointed cases are the novel- 
ets of the collection, “Profession” 
and “The Ugly Little Boy.” The 
latter appeared in Galaxy as 
“Lastborn.”

ACE BOOKS: Ring Around the

mak’s wonderful novel of parallel 
worlds, first serialized in Galaxy, 
is worth rereading . Beyond the 
Vanishing Point, Ray Cummings; 
The Secret of Zi, Kenneth Bulmer; 
Ace Double, 35(*. The Cummings is 
the creaking prototype of The In-

alternates extremely good with ex- 
crutiatingly bad writing in a rapid- 
fire tale of rebellion against alien 
rule . Threshold of Eternity, John 
Brunner; The War of Two Worlds, 
Poul Anderson; Ace Double, 35^. 
Brunner has the vast imagination 
of van Vogt — along with the same 
addiction to bewildering plots. An- 
derson’s minor effort is about the 
manipulation of Earth and Mars 
into a senseless attritive war by 
form-changing outworlders.

Britain’s angry young SF men are 
cataclysmic as well. But Harold 
Mead, Eklmund Cooper and now 
newcomer John Bowen each has 
something fresh to offer aside from 
doom. Bowen’s story of survival

hard-hitting, with bitingly satiric 
touches for added discomfort . 
The Tide Went Out, Charles Eric 
Maine, 35^. Maine joins the select 
group above with this superior job, 
comparable in quality to his High

RIMA Brogan was checked 
in. 

“Your appointment?” 

“Mr. Pierre, at eight-thirty.” 
“Your name?” 

“Mrs. Brogan.” 

“Here it’s Snyder. They prob- 
ably got it spelled wrong. Go right 
ahead, please.” 

They took off her coat, also her 
dress. Two, three girls around her, 
exceedingly trim in their hospital 
gowns, slipped one over her head 
too. 

They grabbed her alligator 
purse and dropped it into a sort of 
waterproof container which they 



fastened on the armrest of the den- 
tist chair in which they urged her 
to sit. 

“So it’s right next to you,” one 
explained, “but without getting 
singed, splashed, dyed, stiffened, or 
shrunk as you go along.” 

There were about twelve den- 
tist chairs facing mirrors on the 
walls, most of them empty now. 
One was somewhat isolated, 
thronelike, with a steel ring around 
it on the ceiling on which a curtain 
was fastened like a baldachin. The 
curtain could be drawn to shut off 
the throne from the sight of the 
world. 




TRUE SELF 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS

Prima Brogan just sat there. 
Soon a lady walked in, clad in a 
beautiful steel-blue suit with 
matching scarf. Everything about 
her was perfect: gait and posture, 
the fit of her high-heeled pumps, 
the soft flow of her platinum curls, 
the shape and shading of her eyes 
and long lashes. So early in the 
morning. 

Her smile bared flawless teeth. 
“Is this your first appointment, 
Mrs. Brogan?” she said with a low 
and modest, musical and pleasing 
voice. 

“Yes. I’ve never been here be- 
fore.” 

“We hoF>e you’ll come back 
often.” She smiled again and 
walked away. 

Another lady walked in, no less 
perfect than the first. But, whereas 
the first was tuned in blue, the sec- 
ond lady’s basic chord was rose. 
A tight dusty-rose gown buttoned 
down in front, with gold-red shoes 
and flaming hair. 

She smiled her smile and said, 
“Would you like something to 
read?” Then she fastened a glass 
table on the armrest of the dentist 
chair, on which she nonchalantly 
dropped three or four illustrated 
magazines. They seemed to ar- 
range themselves spontaneously in 
such a way that one could read all 
the titles and dates: a tastefully 
and studiously designed pattern. 
Then the lady smiled again and 
walked away. 



^ I HE third lady was one of those 
in the hospital gowns. But it 
was amazing what a simple belt, a 
tasteful pin, a bracelet falling cas- 
ually from under reversed open 
cuffs could do. The lady had a corn- 
flower fastened on the barrette that 
held her chestnut locks. She wore 
white satin slippers, and even if 
attired in a hospital gown, she was 
no less perfect than her two pre- 
decessors. 

“Would you like anything from 
the bar?” she asked, and smiled as 
she accepted Prima’s negative an- 
swer, smiled discreetly and under- 
standingly. 

In the meantime, other women 
began to trickle in. They were far 
less perfect than the ladies of the 
establishment. One had a run in 
her nylon; the other, deformed toes. 
The polish on the third one’s nails 
was chipped, and the fourth shook 
dandruff from unkempt and oily 
fladous. They walked clumsily; 
their skin was dull, their eyes art- 
less. 

Looking at clients and operators, 
one might have wondered how 
many sittings it would take the 
former to achieve the perfection of 
the latter, or perhaps whether the 
operators were not simply clients 
who had come here often and pa- 
tiently and thus acquired esthetic 
perfection along with the privilege 
of serving as operators — a privi- 
lege granted for good behavior to 
patients or inmates of other estab- 



152

lishments or institutions as well. 

Having shed their clothes, 
donned their gowns, and secured 
their purses in protective custodies, 
the women took their places in the 
dentist chairs, and soon an uncouth 
conversation crossed the spaces be- 
tween chair and chair. 

“Aren’t you glad you don’t live 
on Broad Street? My word, that 
was terrible last night.” 

“I heard it over the late news. 
They announced it with all the de- 
tails. I never heard anything like 
that . .” 

“I saw it in this morning’s paper. 
What pictures! Simply gruesome. 
I don’t know how they did it. 
Makes your hair stand on end.” 
“You know her father, poor soul, 
he was run over last month — Oh, 
you didn’t know? He was a second 
cousin of Mrs. Barnes’ brother-in- 
law. So I knew it all along. I wasn’t 
surprised a bit.” 

A bit kept repeating itself as on 
a cracked record, a bit a bit a bit bi 
bt, growing muter each time, trans- 
forming itself into air bubbles ris- 
ing to a water surface. The woman’s 
head had in fact been immersed in 
Mr. Pierre’s shampoo. 

“Beauty,” Mr. Pierre explained 
to Prima, “beauty is not something 
you can stick onto people; draw it; 
paint it on. Look at that lady 
there,” he said, and they opened the 
circular curtain and rolled the 
woman out on a stretcher, stiff and 
cold. “She is dull. No sensitivity, 



no depth in her expression, no mat- 
ter how many layers of makeup 
you throw there. But the lady 
wants — or is supposed — to look 
profound, sensitive, exp>erienced. 
So what do I do? I drown her. In 
fifteen minutes, they will revive 
her. The usual exercises any life 
guard can handle. This is what Mr. 
Pierre’s world-famous shampoo 
does for you. Look at the little 
folder.”

“Hello, everyone,” Mrs. Fire- 
stone said, brash and nasal. She 
was a beanstalk of a lady, most 
imperfect, with dark-rimmed 
glasses over a glossy nose, and 
walked like a dragoon. 

“They got him, you know. I

You knew it all along? What the 
hell! They always say that, to keep 
them off the Chair. Now you saw 
yourself what he did last night. I 
sure hope he’ll get the Chair. I 
hope they’ll have to switch it on 
two or three times too. Would 
be too good for him just to die 
right off . .” 

“Would you mind stepping over 
here, Mrs. Firestone? Mr. Irwing 
will be right with you.” 

II 

A MAN, unless he is Mr. Pierre, 
in his black belted blouse, 
with manicured hands pensively 
stroking his Vandyke, black, trim 
and pointed — a man, unless he is 
Mr. Frederic, Mr. Irwing, or Mr. 
Robert, with no face over the 
white gown giving off a faint odor 
of tobacco and eau de Cologne to- 
gether with words well groomed 
and bleached of meaning — a man 
in a beauty shop is out of place. 
He causes a nervous hustling and 
rustling. The conversation halts, 
towels are thrown on bared legs, 
curtains drawn hastily, chairs 
turned and mirrors covered. If, at 
least, he veiled his intrusion with 
a gentle white gown. If at least, 
he masked his face, like the visit- 
ing fathers in the maternity ward. 

But he sat there, sheer and 
male, in a loudly striped suit. He 
sat on the armrest of his girl’s 
chair, and they looked at a fashion 



magazine which lay open in the 
girl’s lap. The girl was plump, in 
a black jersey and gray skirt. Her 
stockings sagging, her heels trod- 
den down. Her hands were stout 
and fat and yellow, and so was 
her face, in which rolled a pair 
of large black eyes as she nodded, 
too often, too rapidly, at what the 
man said. And her lips were thick, 
heavily painted, though innocent 
like a child’s. 

MAN : That’s the one I like. That’ll 
go with the dress admirably 
well. 

GIRL: (Nods, wide-eyed, emphati- 
cally) 

MR. piere: Sir. It’s her first visit, 
isn’t it? Sir, would you mind 
stepping over here? You see, the 
ladies . 

MAN AND GIRL: (Get Up, follow 
Mr. Pierre to a chair in the cor- 
ner, round which Mr. Frederic 
and Mr. Robert hurriedly place 
a par av ant) 

MAN: (Seated again on the arm- 
rest of the girl’s chair, dangling 
his legs, looking up to Mr. 
Pierre) You see this dress? It’s 
nothing like the one I bought 
her. I don’t see how I ever 
bought it. The terms were easy, 
it’s true, but it adds up to a 
year’s salary. It looks as plain 
as this one here. But it’s worked 
in various metals, precious 
metals, I assume, on a ground of 
crystal — and the effect of the 
colors. Her hair ought to be

golden red, to go with it. That’s 
easy, I guess, but there are those 
eyes. Can we get away from 
those cow-eyes? I mean they 
are very nice — but with that 
dress . 

GIRL: (Nods, wide-eyed) 

MR. PIERRE: We could take care 
of that without any trouble at 
all. Three shots and we kill off 
the source of pigmentation alto- 
gether and base the color 
scheme on albino. There are two 
slight inconveniences: myopia 
and conjunctivitis, but we can 
handle that with Mr. Pierre’s 
liquid contact lenses containing 
special ever-bright eye lotion. 
Easy application. A whole 
month’s supply in this pocket- 
size easy-to-carry plastic bottle 
for only eight dollars. 

man: Of course, those lips, with- 
out those eyes — they would 
seem like a blotch on the golden 
flow. They would ruin the neck- 
line. They would block the con- 
templation of the whole . 

MR. PIERRE: We can take off a 
good portion. But if you’ve 
come here to take my advice, 
I should say that your approach 
is somewhat mistaken. Beauty, 
you know, beauty you get not 
by making the lady conform to 
the dress you choose and cher- 
ish, but by choosing a dress to 
suit the beautiful lady you 
cherish. 

girl: (Rolls questioning cow- 



eyes from one to the other) 

MAN: The lady, she’s my fiancee. 
She is young. Vera, darling, 
wouldn’t you like to look like 
this girl in that dress? 

GIRL: (Nods, wide-eyed, emphati- 
cally) 

MR. PIERRE: To be beautiful, the 
lady must not look like any 
other lady. She must look like 
herself: her true self. We must 
discern her good features, un- 
derline them, develop them; we 
must suppress her not-so-good 
features, eliminate them. Ele- 
gance, you know, means choos- 
ing, reducing to the essential. 

man: And who decides what is 
essential? Who knows her true 
self? 

MR. PIERRE: (Has passed a comb 
through her hair, then bobbed it 
up, holding her head, looking 
over her head into the mirror; 
scanning, with upturned eyes, 
his own solemn image, pleased) 
I do. It’s my job. My life-long 
experience with beautiful and 
not-so-beautiful ladies. 

MAN: (Doubtful) And if your idea 
should not coincide with mine? 
The dress: you haven’t seen it. 
Please keep in mind the color 
scheme, the neckline, the rhy- 
thm, the flow. Vera, darling, you 
want to, don’t you? 

GIRL: (Nods, wide-eyed, emphati- 
cally) 

MR. PIERRE: (Fixing his own eyes 
in the mirror, hypnotically) By

the time I get through with the 
lady, she’ll be beautiful in any 
dress. 

man: (Yielding, with feeble 

voice) Well, what do you sug- 
gest should be done? 

MR. PIERRE: (Still holding the 

girl’s head, still gazing into his 
own eyes in the mirror) First of 
all, the color of the face isn’t 
right, and too much surface. 
Also, these bacon folds around 
the waistline. A bit dumpy, the 
whole little lady. 

man; Diet? Massage? 

MR. PIERRE: Goodness gracious! 
None of that any more. 

MAN: What’s wrong? 

MR. PIERRE; In most cases it does 
not work. You know the ladies. 
The stealthy trips at night to the 
refrigerator . 

MAN : I know plenty of cases where 
it worked beautifully. 

MR. PIERRE: I guess you never 
looked into their faces, where 
desire, frustrated for months, 
where triumphing will power, 
hardness, self-directed and 
other-directed, leave marks of a 
most appalling unfemininity. 
Add to this the effect of heavy, 
compensatory smoking, and the 
fidgets. No, thank you, no more 
dieting ladies for me. 

MAN: Well, what do you suggest? 

MR. PIERRE: (Taking his eyes off 
the mirror and suddenly fasten- 
ing them on man) Von Barbar 
mask and German bath. In two 
hours, it’s all over. 



man; (Cowed) If you say so . 
Anyway, some slimming . the 
dress. What else? 

MR. PIERRE: The eyes should be 
brightened, but without bluing. 
The texture of the hair must be 
changed. 

MAN: It’s too woolly. 

MR. PIERRE: And the hands. We’ll 
look at them after the Von Bar- 
bar treatment. But my guess is 
they’ll have to be changed al- 
together. 

man; The hand-bank . that’s a 
delicate matter. The sleeves of 
the dress . 

MR. PIERRE: Leave that to me. I 
assure you I know what’s best 
for her. I haven’t gone wrong yet. 
You may call for her in three

RS. Firestone got under the 
drier. Her head, curled up and 
clip-spiked, in savage-warrior fa- 
shion, under the drier, her bare feet 
in a footbath, softening them up for 
the pedicure. 

“Roast head and stewed feet 
today,” she scintillated. And then, 
as the drier deafened her, “Honey,” 
she screamed to the operator, 
“would you mind handing me my 
purse?” 

“We can hear you, Mrs. Fire- 
stone,” the operator said softly, her 
mouth close to the lady’s ear. “You 
don’t have to holler.” 

“This drier is awfully noisy,” 

157 



TRUE SELF 



Mrs. Firestone screamed. “I can’t 
tell whether I am hollering or whis- 
pering.” 

“We do that on purpose,” Mr. 
Pierre explained to the lady he 
was combing. “The noise, and the 
isolation it imposes, is good for the 
ladies’ nerves, therefore for their 
beauty. It relaxes. Some told me 
they heard music in the din; others 
faint. Of course, if they scream 
through it like that, it serves no 
purpose. Your fingernails. Miss 
Dirtworth, would you like Nosegay 
or Psyche-pink?” 

“Honey,” Mrs. Firestone 
screamed, “I’m on fire. Would you 
mind turning this thing down 
some? A friend of mine, she gave 
herself a permanent, you know, and 
the drier was too hot and, guess 
what, her hair fell out just like 
that” Mrs. Firestone snapp>ed her 
fingers. “The curlers dropped off, 
with the singed hair in it Can you 
beat it? She coulda died.” 

Mr. Pierre walked over and 
pushed up the drier so Mrs. Fire- 
stone could hear. 

“Please, Mrs. Firestone, don’t 
talk so very loud. It’s no good for 
you and it disturbs the other ladies.” 

Mrs. Firestone was pleased to 
be scolded by him. She encom- 
passed him with melting, adoring 
eyes. 

“By the way,” he added, reward- 
ing her, “I promised to let you see 
a Von Barbar mask. I am doing 
one now. Look over there and see 
how it works.” 



He walked back to Vera, where 
half a dozen operators were busy 
arranging all sorts of liquids and 
lotions and flames and syringes. 
They went silently and seriously 
about their business as though it 
were a ritual, like waiters getting 
ready for the crepes Suzette. 

Mr. Pierre pushed back his 
sleeves and announced for every 
one to hear. 

“You see, this is how it works. If 
you put the Von Barbar prepara- 
tion on a lady’s skin — dried skin, 
spoiled unclean skin, old wrinkled 
skin, fatty tissue — it dies. It simply 
and quite painlessly dies off. This 
lady here, she’s young; she does 
not need much. We can go two 
layers deep with one application; 
but some need more. Then we have 
to repeat the treatment after a 
couple of days, and you can see 
them in the meantime, our clients, 
on the street, even at parties, with 
inches of dead body around them. 
Men too, on sunny beaches, with 
mute mumbling dead lips. There’s 
nothing to it. Most of them look 
just as dead before the treatment, 
which, if applied correctly, merely 
confirms an extant fact.” 

U NDER Mr. Pierre’s careful su- 
pervision, the operators han- 
dled instruments, mixed crackling 
fuming liquids, blotted out expand- 
ing flames, fan-cooled the finished 
product, and applied it gently to 
Vera’s face, neck, arms, legs, mid- 
riff, hips and belly. Flabby and yel- 



158 



GALAXY 



lowish, she turned flabbier and 
yellower yet. 

“After that,” Mr. Pierre went on 
explaining, “we take them into the 
German bath and the whole stuff 
comes off. Like the dry outer skins 
of an onion, till the fresh juicy core 
comes out. In two hours, a lady can 
get rid of twenty pounds of super- 
fluous fat, of pimply skin and a 
threadbare scalp. She’ll rise from 
the German bath slim, trim and 
prim, if somewhat shorter, and 
very young.” 

Several ladies, from under driers 
and over manicure tables, called 
out: “Yes, it’s wonderful.” 

“You would think so,” Mr. 
Pierre said, while massaging Vera’s 
droopy cheeks with his thumbs, 
deadening them deeper, and gaz- 
ing into his own eyes in the mirror. 
“You would think so. And I give 
them a pamphlet, a personalized 
pamphlet to each one, telling them 
how to stay the way they are and 
not to repeat the mistakes that 
made them the way they were. 
But you’d be amazed. As soon as 
they get out of here, they literally 
rush back into their former selves. 
It’s shocking how they manage to 
get old and ugly in no time. And 
the nucleus thins out in the pro- 
cess. It is a strain, to decay in such 
a hurry — and you can’t repeat the 
treatment more than two, three 
times; otherwise the German bath 
takes off all there was to a lady. 
Therefore I recommend it only for 
very special occasions: a late un- 



toward debutante, a business 
woman who has been fired, a widow 
who has to make her life over — I 
mean unless it is a matter of an 
inch or two . How do you do, 
Mrs. Evergreen? Would you mind 
stepping over here? Be seated, 
please. Mr. Frederic will be right 
with you. You have your third 
shampoo today? Your expression 
has gained in profoundness. Didn’t 
your husband tell you too? Well, 
happy trip.” 

“How do you manage to keep 
your gas bill down?” one lady 
howled from under the drier. 
“Watch out, honey,” she added, 
turning to the manicurist, “and 
don’t you snip off that finger.” 

“I use two burners instead of 
three,” the lady under the next 
drier screamed back, “and don’t 
do much baking.” 

“And you know, every time some 
one gasses himself in the kitchen, 
that shows on the bill, terribly. 
Ouch, honey, I told you. Now you 
did chop it off . .” 

A T that the door opened and the 
man came back. On his arms, 
before him, he carried the dress 
like a sleeping beauty. He walked 
on tiptoe, so as not to disturb. His 
cheeks were flushed, his chin white, 
his forehead studded with pearling 
sweat, his eyes glimmering, and 
every gesture racked with deep 
emotion. He walked straight up to 
the chair in which he had left the 
girl. 



TRUE SELF

Staring for a moment at her, 
then past her, he asked, “Where’s 
Vera? Is she ready?” 

Seven operators, busy in a half- 
circle over her prostrate body, 
lifted, their curly heads. They 
looked like a great halo of angel 
faces around her resting on the 
ground of their mantles which 
merged into a single white surface 
before his glimmering eyes. They 
shrugged their shoulders. It looked 
like a wave, making a half circle. 

“Mr. Pierre told you.” the first 
one said. 

“It would take about three 
hours,” said the second. 

“She is not ready yet,’’ said the 
third. 

“It will be another hour or so,” 
said the fourth. 

“Where is she?” he interrupted 
them, greatly alarmed. 

They lowered their curly heads 
to form a crown of great sunflowers 
round her head. They felt .sorry for 
him. 

“Here she is,” the fifth, sixth and 
seventh said softly, almost whis- 
pering. 

It was a horrid sight. The Von 
Barbar mask must have reached its 
high point of efficacy, for Vera 
looked absolutely dead, an impres- 
sion heightened by the ghastly pale 
green light flooding her from a 
reflector lamp posted at the foot- 
end. Her eyes, bleached to a 
watery tan and kept wide open by 
little pegs, stared glassily into the 
milky light. Her hair flowed from 



her like a piece of wet carpeting, a 
vicious dark copper-red, drops of 
which swam carelessly over her 
forehead and down the cheeks. Her 
ai ms were spread out and fastened 
in handcuffs to the armrest of the 
dentist chair. Back and armrests 
had been lowered to form a cross- 
shaped bed. 

The sunflower crown unlocked 
and the black figure of Mr. Pierre 
inserted itself, leaning over her 
head. Below the deep deadness, a 
smile tried to stir, but did not quite 
reach the surface. The golden beam 
gathered from the diffusion of her 
ken, boring into his eyes with love, 
desire. 

“How is the little lady doing?” 
he said with a tender smile. 

Then he took a small trowel and 
stuck it into her side and turned it 
around. There was no blood. 

“I think we are ready,” he said, 
and his voice was pleased. 

The man almost dropped the 
dress. “Ve- Ve- Ve- Ve-” he stam- 
mered, confused. Then he lifted the 
dress up high before him with both 
hands. It seemed strangely alive in 
the pale green light. He pulled it 
onto his breast, hugged it protec- 
tively, passionately, and, without 
saying another word, he rushed out. 

Vl^HEN Vera camp out of the 
German bath, she looked 
slim, trim and prim. Mr. Pierre 
combed her hair, bobbed it up with 
a wavy motion of his hands and.

looking over her head at his own 
image in the mirror, he said, “Are 
we pleased, little lady? Tomorrow 
we shall have our first lesson in in- 
dividualized makeup. And tomor- 
row we shall learn a better jwsture, 
more correct carriage. And tomor- 
row we must not nod our little head 
so much any more. And tomor- 
row—” 

Ladies came and ladies left and 
Vera waited. She saw shampoos 
and masks and baths, got used to 
them, and waited. She listened to 
much uncouth gossip between chair 
and chair: how much disaster and 
crime and betrayal and misfortune. 
And she waited. 

beautiful receptionist in the 
blue suit with matching scarf 
said to her: “Well, well, how darling 
we look!” And then: “Honey, your 
skirt is too large for you now. You 
might just as well fix it — it will 
give you something to do.” 

Ultima rose from her dentist 
chair. They slipped off her gown, 
brushed her shining neck and shoul- 



ders. They slipped on her dress, 
handed her the purse, dusting, wip- 
ing, brushing, adding a last touch of 
perfection to their handiwork. 

The lady in dusty-rose called on 
Vera and brought her a white gown. 
“Take off your clothes, honey, and 
put on this one. You can fix them 
better like that.” And she fastened 
the gown adroitly with a suitable 
belt, a becoming pin. 

The operators spread sawdust on 
the floor and began to sweep it. 
They sprayed the mirrors with win- 
dex, dusted the chairs, sterilized the 
combs, put away the curlers, hung 
the towels and locked the safe. 

The beautiful lady in the white 
gown, with the pretty pin and 
matching bracelet and the corn- 
flower in her barrette, walked up to 
Vera. They looked like sisters now, 
except that Vera was a shade 
lighter, newer. 

“Honey,” the lady said, and 
smiled gently her perfect smile, 
“honey, why don’t you give us a 
hand while you are waiting?”

T he thin little voice buzzed 
and sang; “Good morning, 
Sutherland Master! Good 
morning, Boss.” 

Berl Sutherland jumped with all 
his arms and legs at once, like a 
startled infant, and awoke. 

He was in a canopied bed, in — 
yes, he remembered now — in the 
Old House of the Blick plantation. 
The maid was fussing around him. 

“This is Persephone,” cooed the 
maid’s voice. “I am your personal 
servant, Sutherland Master. The 
Colonel wishes you good morning 
and hopes you enjoy your stay.” 
“Thanks,” said Sutherland blur- 
rily. 

It was all beginning to come 
back to him — the long flight 
from Leesville, the arrival in the 
middle of the night, the sister of the 
girl he loved, who had made him 
welcome. 

He watched the maid, bending 
over him, setting something down 
on the night table, touching the 
buttons that opened the shades and 
turned on the air vents and brought 
gently brisk music out of the 
speaker grille beside his bed. They

certainly took care of their com- 
pany on these plantations, he 
thought in sleepy admiration. 

He sat up reluctantly. 

“You wish to rise now, Suther- 
land Master?” The maid’s voice 
came from under his pillow. That 
puzzled Sutherland for a moment; 
he had been on the planet less than 
twenty-four hours and its customs 
were still unfamiliar to him. 

“Yeah, I wish to rise,” he replied. 

The maid said: “Your clothes 
are laid out. Call if you wish me, 
Sutherland Master. The name is 
Persephone.” 

“Thanks,” said Sutherland, but 
only to air; the maid had buzzed 
through the room at high speed and 
was gone. 

He shrugged and got out of bed. 

I T was a nice room, too, he 
thought with a touch of worry. 
The bed had a handsome spread of 
gold brocade, now neatly folded 
down; the carpeting was thick, the 
furniture expensive. Thelma’s fam- 
ily really had it. 

What in all the worlds, he won- 
dered, did she see in him? Suther- 
'land wasn’t used to underrating 
himself; he was aware that he was 
>wung, healthy, reasonably bright. 
But he was also aware that his draft 
number was up and that his total 
income for the year would hardly 
buy the contents of this one room, 
let alone the enormous rest of the 
plantation owned by Colonel Blick, 



Thelma’s brother. Still . 

Well, she had invited him here. 
Too bad she couldn’t have been on 
hand when he arrived, but there it 
was. 

Sutherland got up, staggered 
over to the window and, wincing, 
tried to draw the shades again. Sun- 
light was all right in its place, but 
what was coming in the window 
was a sallow orange color, and 
brighter than he liked even so. But 
there seemed to be no way for him 
to draw the shades. The maid had 
pushed a button, he remembered, 
but which one? 

To Sutherland’s groggy inspec- 
tion, there seemed to be at least 
fifty — if all the round, square and 
toggle-shaped things on the control 
panel by the bed could be called 
buttons — and which of them might 
control the windows, he had no idea. 

Nor, on second thought, did he 
want to tempt fate by experiment- 
ing. It was all getting very compli- 
cated, he thought worriedly. It 
hadn’t seemed a bit complicated 
back on Elarth, where one normal 
bright moon had filled one normal 
starlit sky, and one extreniely nor- 
mal girl named Thelma Coolidge 
Blick had been out on the balcony 
with him. But that was half a year 
ago, and a good many light-years 
away, and besides there hadn’t 
been a war on then. Now he was on 
Lee, sixth planet of the larger com- 
ponent of Sirius, and Thelma was 
— where was Thelma?

“Excuse me, sir,” said a timid 
voice. 

Sutherland jumped. In the door- 
way of the bath — his bath — stood 
a small dark man. And in his hand 
the man held, for the Lord’s sake, 
a mint julep. 

The man coughed apologetically. 
“I am Miguel Mookerjan, your 
neighbor. Pardon this intrusion.” 

“Good morning,” growled Suth- 
erland. 

“Yes,” said Mookerjan thought- 
fully, “I suppose it is.” He inspected 
the room, coming at last to the glass 
in his hand. “Oh, yes. Perhaps you 
would care for this? I am a Mus- 
lim,” he said with pride, “and we 
are not allowed alcohol. But I do 
not wish to offend our host. So I 
came through the bath which we 
share to offer you, as you might 
perhaps say, a dividend.” 

Sutherland was puzzled, but he 
followed the direction of Mooker- 
jan’s eyes, and the answer to his 
puzzlement was on the table by his 
bed. A mint julep; the maid had 
brought him one of the confounded 
things too. Before breakfast! 

“But you have not drunk your 
own,” said Mookerjan with con- 
cern. “You are not of the Faith? Or 
perhaps A.A.? Or — oh, I see. I de- 
duce, sir — ” 

“Berl Sutherland.” 

“I deduce, Mr. Sutherland, that 
you have never visited the colonel 
before?” 

Sutherland shook his head. 



“Ah, yes. I suppose,” said Mook- 
erjan thoughtfully, “that you are a 
business associate? A buyer of 
proto-spuds for one of the inter- 
planetary exchanges? No? Then 
perhaps an attorney — I have heard 
that there are some estate matters 
to be settled. Or could you have 
known his father, the late Colonel 
Blick, or are you related in family? 
Or-” 

“Mr. Mookerjan,” said Suther- 
land dangerously, “I’ll tell you my 
business here without your dredg- 
ing for it. I’mi engaged to be married 
to his sister.” 

“Oh, splendid!” cried Mookerjan. 
“A wonderful girl, Mr. Sutherland! 
I assure you, I have met many 
charming young ladies, but few 
compare with Robin Blick!” 

“Thelma Blick, Mr. Mookerjan.” 
“That sister? But — ” Mookerjan 
hesitated. “Well,” he said, “I wish 
you every happiness. And now I 
imagine you wish to dress. You will 
not want to be late for breakfast. 
The colonel is so much more aj>- 
proachable then! A bientot, Mr. 
Sutherland, a bientot!" 

Blick place was nothing 
-*• special for the planets of the 
Sirian System. Sparsely populated, 
rich and fertile, the Sirian planets 
spawned countless thousands of 
aristocrats, so the colonel was by 
no means exceptional. But the total 
effect of the big house, seen by day, 
was enough to dwindle what re-

mained of the morale of Berl Suth- 
erland. 

Discount the wide marble stair- 
case that wound down from the 
sleeping floor to the great hall at 
the entrance. Don’t consider the 
obvious wealth of the furnishings 
— tapestried walls and finely made 
furniture, all of them imported 
across light-years of space at a shipK 
ping cost Sutherland could not 
guess. These could be hand-me- 
downs; the antebellum South on 
Earth, centuries before, owned 
many such a plantation where the 
owners counted themselves lucky 
to see a hundred dollars in cash 
from one year to the next. 

But there was much more — so 
much more. The food. The fine 
liquors. And, over and above every- 
thing else, the servants. 

To Sutherland’s bewildered eye, 
there seemed to be more servants 
than people in the room. All the 
same size, all the same shape, all 
stamped out of the same dies in 
the same factories. The plantations 
of Lee had their slaves, and the 
slaves were robots; they moved 
about the rooms of the Blick plan- 
tation house like busy beetles, 
cleaning, removing, serving and 
tending. 

Degenerate, thought Sutherland 
angrily. You certainly wouldn’t 
know there was a war on. Why 
must these people act like Confed- 
erate massas? A body servant for 
every guest and the most personal 



tasks done for you — it was revolt- 
ing; it was nothing like the stripped- 
down, Spartan life he had been 
brought up to on Earth . 

But it just might be, he thought, 
that if there had been an endless 
labor supply available on Earth, 
every human might have just such 
a home. Meanwhile, he was here. 
He would, he decided, attempt to 
enjoy it. 

“Good morning,” he said to the 
room at large, and let a small 
bronze-colored servant take him to 
a chair. Thelma was not in sight, 
he had noted at once, which freed 
him to observe the others who were. 

The Blicks liked a house full. 
Lolling against the upholstered pil- 
lar of a round divan. Colonel Blick 
himself was reading the paper and 
answering absently the remarks of 
his guests. He had nodded to 
Sutherland, nothing more. Miguel 
Mookerjan glanced up, smiled 
emptily, and returned to his meal. 
The others gave Sutherland scarce- 
ly that much attention. All right, 
thought Sutherland belligerently, 
who the devil do you think you 
are? 

But he remembered that his 
plan was to enjoy himself, and he 
gestured to the servants wheeling 
the little tables of food. 

Neither of the Blick sisters was 
in the room. There were three 
young men, a matched set, wearing 
the same informal sort of uniform 
as Colonel Blick; like him, they

were more interested in their news- 
pap>ers than in human society. 
There were a couple of girls whose 
identity Sutherland couldn’t guess, 
and a man in dark glasses on Suth- 
erland’s left, solemnly eating, like 
a stoker filling a furnace, without 
looking up. 

And then Thelma floated into 
the room. 

S UTHERLAND stood up hasti- 
ly. “Darling!” she cried across 
sixty feet of wall-to-wall carpeting. 
“Dearest, I’m so glad you got here! 
I’ve been counting the minutes!” 
Sutherland said awkwardly: 
“Hello, dear.” Why, he thought, 
astonished, this is a beautiful girl. 
She was blonde, heavy-haired 
blonde, with two solid coils spiral- 
ing away from the nape of her 
neck; her eyes were bluest blue, her 
figure perfect. 

“You know Robin,” she said 
kindly, standing on tiptoe to be 
kissed. 

There was another girl with her 
— the sister, the one who had let 
him in. Sutherland nodded. 

“Poor angel,” said Thelma softly, 
“I know what’s bothering you. You 
wanted me to be here when you 
arrived.” 

“Not necessarily,” said Suther- 
land quickly, “but — ” 

“But I couldn’t. Of course I 
couldn’t! Aren’t you sweet to un- 
derstand that? And I would have 
been there, dearest, if it hadn’t 



been for that terrible party at the 
Grossfaders last night And when 
Pat Grossfader brought me home 
and I heard that you’d arrived and 
gone to bed, why, I just wanted to 
throw myself into your arms. And 
I would have, too, if I hadn’t been 
the teeniest bit high. Oh, those sloe 
gin daiquiris!” 

“I hope you had a pleasant 
night’s sleep,” the mousy sister said 
more formally to Sutherland. 

He nodded again. “Fine, thanks.” 
Across the room. Colonel Blick 
was reading something from the 
paper, laughing. Sutherland al- 
lowed the servants to help him to 
kippers, scrambled eggs, yogurt and 
a blend of eight kinds of fruit juices, 
sweetened with Antarean honey. 

“Try the toast,” Robin Blick 
said politely. “It’s our own bread, 
baked from the proto-spuds we 
grow.” 

“I’m not very hungry,” Suther- 
land apologized. He was craning 
his neck. Odd, but while the robots 
were serving him, Thelma seemed 
to have disappeared. “I wonder — ” 
Robin said: “She’s probably in 
the butler’s pantry. She’ll be back.” 
Sutherland felt a faint chill. 
Around the room, the conversation 
flowed smoothly. Mr. Mookerjan 
was inquiring nervously about the 
animal origins of his fried scrapple. 
The three young army officers were 
chattering about the shootin’ and 
fishin’ on every landable planet in 
five solar systems. The girls — 



WAY UP YONDER 



167 



Thelma had brought them home 
from the party at the Grossfaders, 
it turned out — were perkily com- 
paring hangovers. 

“I think,” said Sutherland apolo- 
getically, “that I’d like to talk to 
your brother.” 

“Sure,” said Robin Blick. “Help 
yourself.” 

G etting up, Sutherland made 
his way across the room. The 
colonel was deep in his newspaper, 
preening his beard. It was a hard 
beard to preen, being pale gold in 
color and the texture of the down 
on the back of a new-hatched chick. 
The colonel was nineteen years old. 

“Oh, hello there,” said the colo- 
nel, looking up for a moment, and ; 
“Damn! Charles, did you see this 
in the paper? Grogan’s going back 
to Mars.” 

“Mars!” cried the nearest of the 
young officers, dashed. “Good heav- 
ens! But he promised to come 
here!” 

The other youths joined the 
chorus. Sutherland listened, puz- 
zled. Whoever this Grogan was, he 
was somebody important. Perhaps 
a crop buyer, he thought; he knew 
that the big combines on Earth 
sent their representatives around. 
Or — well, it could be something 
more important, something to do 
with the war. 

“I don’t remember the name,” 
he said politely. “Is Grogan a com- 
mission buyer?” 



“Commission buyer ...” The 
colonel put his paper down and 
looked at Sutherland more care- 
fully. “My dear fellow, Grogan’s 
a musician.” 

“A roar-and-shack soarer, friend,” 
said Charles. 

“Oh, that roar!” added the sec- 
ond of the other officers. 

“And that shack!” 

“Come along!” cried the colonel, 
jumping up. “You’ve got to hear 
his latest tape, Sutherland!” 

And that was that, as far as talk- 
ing to the boy about anything as 
important as his sister’s hand was 
concerned; Sutherland couldn’t get 
his attention that long. 

He sat listening to the subtly 
buzzing drone of roar-and-shack 
music as long as he could take it, 
but that wasn’t very long, and when 
he escaped and looked for Thelma, 
she was gone. 

“Women’s business,” she had 
said, according to her sister Robin, 
but what the women’s business was, 
Thelma had not said and Robin 
did not choose to tell. 

Ho-hum, thought Sutherland, 
somewhat dampened, it isn’t a bit 
the way it looked from that balcony 
on Earth. 

II 

' HE man in the dark glasses 
said : “I suppose you’ll be going 
in, eh? Good luck, Sutherland. I 
was in the last one.” 



168 



GALAXY 



Sutherland was impressed. Over- 
head, the orange-tinted plastic dome 
let in enough of the light from blaz- 
ing bright Sirius to bring the inten- 
sity to Earth standards, though the 
hues were all blue-white or dying 
under the unshielded ultra-violet. 

Sutherland looked sidelong at 
the man in the dark glasses, his face 
sallow in the orange light, and said : 
“I guess it was pretty rough.” 

“Oh, rough enough,” the man 
said modestly. His name was La- 
Fargue and he was only five years 
or so older than Sutherland. He 
must have lied about his age, Suth- 
erland thought abstractedly. “The 
worst thing is that you never see 
the enemy. Interstellar war isn’t 
personal. It’s chart your line of fire 
and pop your missiles off and wait. 
Well, it takes forty days to get to 
the nearest star even in sub-space, 
you know. But it takes four years 
for the light to come back, so you 
don’t know what luck you’re hav- 
ing.” 

“But then how do you know — ” 

“You don’t know. You don’t 
know a thing, not until the peace 
is declared and you can fly out 
there and look. We got two planets 
of the Antarean system, they tell 
me. I guess the light ought to be 
hitting Earth any day now. But I 
never went and looked. Didn’t want 
to.” He nodded politely and went 
back to the house. 

Sutherland continued to stroll 
around the gardens. That was a 

WAY UP YONDER 



good war, he thought, when we 
fought the Antareans. Six months 
of hard fighting and it was all over; 
they got Pluto and two of Jupiter’s 
outer moons, but who cared about 
those? Only there was always the 
chance that a missile might hit a 
really important planet. Mars, say, 
with its fifty million souls. Venus, 
with its quarter-billion. Or — Earth. 

He swallowed, thinking of what 
an interstellar missile might do to 
rabbit-warren Earth. 

tXDR that matter, war could well 
come to this planet — yes, to 
Lee, to the whole Sirian system. It 
was the technique of interstellar 
war to stand back and try to batter 
your enemy to pieces, but that tech- 
nique was predicated on the sure 
assumption that your enemy would 
pulverize any fleet you might send 
against him. 

That assumption held good for 
Antares, for Sol, for the present 
enemy system of Capella — but 
Sirius, after all, was a frontier sys- 
tem. There were a few space cor- 
vettes, a few emplacements on the 
smaller satellites, nothing that 
would give a flotilla of dread- 
naughts any seriousopposition. The 
Sirian system was fat and open to 
the war’s dangers . 

Assuming, of course, that the 
Sirian system was really in the war. 
Sutherland couldn’t help feeling 
that war was strangely remote here. 
No one seemed to care. 



169 



Still, the Sirian system was cer- 
tainly important to the war — from 
Earth’s point of view, anyhow. 

Lee was only one of the three 
habitable planets, but it was a good 
one. It produced food enough for 
fifty times its own population, food 
that Earth could very well use. 

The planet was near enough to 
its immense primary for the rays 
to be deadly to all who faced it 
without protection. That was why 
the plantation houses were shielded, 
why the crops were worked by 
robots. Humans wouldn’t do. They 
would die. 

Still, thought Sutherland re- 
motely, he would rather have hu- 
man beings around him than — 

He jumped as a shadow crossed 
his face. 

T T was one of the robots, holding 
something out to him. “Curse 
you,” snapped Sutherland, “what 
do you mean sneaking up on me 
like that?” He was startled, and 
surprise brought on anger. 

The servant, silent as a shadow, 
continued mutely to offer him the 
thing that was in its hands. Suther- 
land looked at it at last and recog- 
nized it: a small shoulder radio. 

“Oh,” said Sutherland ungra- 
ciously. “Thanks. I—” He stopped, 
remembering. He strapped the ra- 
dio on and turned on the switch. 
“Thanks,” he said again, knowing 
that this time the robot would hear. 

“You are welcome, Sutherland 



Massa,” said the robot’s unhurried, 
uninflected voice. “Is there any- 
thing you wish?” 

“No — ” he looked at the robot’s 
chest — “no, Persephone.” Yes, that 
was the same one that had brought 
him his morning julep, his own 
personal attendant. The name was 
inscribed on its torso plates. “You 
can go,” he said, and watched the 
little thing move silently away. 

“Mr. Sutherland,” said a girl’s 
voice from behind him, “you really 
ought to keep your radio on. It’s 
unsettling to the servants.” 

“Sorry.” It was Thelma’s mousy 
sister, Robin. “I try to remember,” 
he said, with only part truth. The 
servants were robots, same as the 
field hands, and their voices were 
radio, not sound — as their “eyes” 
were radar instead of receptors for 
the visual spectrum of light. In or- 
der for them to hear or be heard, 
they needed radio equipment. That 
was the little box — the same little 
box he had slept with under his 
pillow. 

“The gardens are lovely this 
morning,” Robin Blick said flatly, 
nodding, and prepared to move 
away. 

Sutherland was galvanized into 
action. “Oh, Miss Blick. I wonder 
if you can tell me where the colonel 
is.” 

The girl stopped and looked at 
him more thoughtfully. 

“I want to — uh — see him,” 
Sutherland explained. 



170 



GALAXY 



She nodded. 

“I want to talk to him about — 
about something.” 

“Yes,” she said, and smiled. Smil- 
ing, she wasn’t mousy at all. “I 
thought you wanted to talk to him 
about something.” 

That was very pleasing, Suther- 
land decided; he couldn’t help grin- 
ning. “Oh,” he said, relaxing, “then 
Thelma’s said something to you? 
Of course. Why shouldn’t she? Sis- 
ters are always close, exchanging 
confidences and so on.” 

XT E looked around the garden 
hastily. There, in a patch of 
portulaca, was a marble bench. “I 
tell you. Miss Blick — Robin. Won’t 
you sit down for a minute? I’ve got 
a few things that are — well, worry- 
ing me.” 

“I bet you have,” said Robin 
Blick. But she let him lead her to 
the bench. 

She didn’t look a bit like her 
sister — brown hair, brown eyes, a 
figure that was nice enough but 
hardly startling, and Thelma was 
definitely startling. But Robin 
seemed, thought Berl Sutherland, 
a friendly, sisterly sort of girl, who 
might be just the person to clear 
up the one or two little doubts that 
in the last twelve hours had perco- 
lated up to the surface of his mind. 

“The thing,” he said, “is that 
Thelma’s sucha high-spirited young 
creature. I wonder if she’s ready 
for marriage. I thought I might 



have a chance to discuss it with 
your brother, but beseems rather—” 
“My brother,” said Robin Blick 
clearly, “is a flat-headed halfwit. 
He’s only nineteen years old and 
maybe he’ll smarten up — some. 
But he’s got a long way to go.” 

“I see,” said Sutherland after a 
second. “I only thought that — you 
know, head of the family, good 
manners, the right thing to do, all 
that sort of thing.” 

“I am sick to my stomach of that 
sort of thing, Mr. Sutherland,” said 
Robin Blick in a pleasantly conver- 
sational tone. “I am sick to death of 
Lee and everything about it.” 
Sutherland cleared his throat. 
Things were getting out of hand; 
it was time to get the conversation 
back where he wanted it. 

He said: “Tell me, what did 
Thelma say about me when she 
told you? I mean if it isn’t a secret.” 
“It isn’t a secret. She didn’t say 
a word.” 

“But - ” 

“She didn’t even say you were 
coming, young man.” 

Sutherland bristled. Young man, 
indeed! Surely the girl wasyounger 
than he! 

“But I thought you said you had 
an idea what I wanted.” 

“Mr. Sutherland,” said Robin 
Blick patiently, “I’ve been Thelma’s 
sister for a long time now. You 
mustn’t think you’re the first young 
man who’s come to talk to her 
brother.”

S UTHERLAND followed Rob- 
in Blick on a guided tour 
through the gardens, but it was 
wasted on him. His thoughts were 
of Thelma Blick and not of the 
place in which he found himself 
for the love of her. 

But it was an interesting place, 
all the same. 

The dome around the Blick 
manor house was a quarter of a 
mile across. Nearly thirty acres 
bloomed under its shallow orange 
roof. There was the house itself and 
its gardens. There were six acres 
of farm, for the beets and tomatoes 
and crisp green lettuce that did 
poorly in Sirius’s direct light. There 
was an artificial pond, three acres 
of it, that stocked fine smallmouths 
and doubled as a reservoir in case 
of fire. There was a grove of fruit 
trees, and there were a dozen acres 
of pasture for the colonel’s select 
herd of registered Black Angus. 

Of course, that was only the 
domed portion of the estate. Out- 
side the dome, naked under the 
blue violence of the primary, were 
over two hundred square miles. It 
was more than a plantation, more 
than a Texan’s ranch; it was a prin- 
cipality. 

This was the thing about Lee’s 
perfect climate: no dust. There 
wasn’t any, the result of high ioni- 
zation from the rays of the primary; 
the dust clumped and agglutinated 
and fell. Well, there was a little — 
if there had been none, that would 



have been the end of farming, be- 
cause it would have been the end 
of rain. Water vapor cannot coal- 
esce readily without tiny dust gran- 
ules for each droplet to form 
around. But because there was some 
dust, though not a great deal, the 
water vapor formed itself in large 
drops, fell and washed the air clean. 
Result: enough rain, and very 
small and few clouds between 
times. A perfect growing climate. 

And the crops that were grown 
were something very special in- 
deed. The name of the principal 
crop was proto-spuds. A miracle 
crop! 

Wrench off the tops and you can 
cook yourself a superb mess of 
greens, rich in vitamins A, C, D and 
a dozen others. Dig the tuberous 
root and it is a treasure of assorted 
food. The peel, toasted, has a fine 
nutlike flavor. The starchy interior, 
dried and ground, makes a flour 
that bakes into delectable bread. 
Pulled young and green and cooked 
whole, the tubers resemble a super- 
Jerusalem artichoke. 

If none of these makes a dish to 
your liking, let the whole thing go 
to flower and seed. Then the petals 
make a splendid jam, a first-rate 
source of all the B vitamins. The 
seeds, toasted, split into hulls and 
kernels. The hulls became a pep- 
pery spice, the seeds a richly per- 
fumed sort of cinnamon. 

It was a valued crop and — vari- 
ously cooked, dried, radio-sterilized

or frozen — it made a priceless ex- 
port article for interstellar trade, 
and an essential part of production 
for war. 

All of this Berl Sutherland 
listened to, dr seemed to, but not 
much of it stayed with him. 

“There is one thing,” he said at 
last, when Robin Blick paused and 
looked at him and seemed to ex- 
pect a question. “I mean there’s 
something I’d like to know. Wasn’t 
— wasn’t Thelma sincere back on 
Earth?” 

“You’ll have to ask her yourself,” 
said Robin, sighing, because he was 
a very nice boy, good-looking and 
smart and with just the right degree 
of shyness, and she didn’t like what 
lay ahead for him. 

Ill 

TT was time for the ten o’clock 
news. Sutherland fumblingly 
tried to turn the set on, but a serv- 
ant shot past him and expertly 
dialed. In the gun room down the 
hall, roar-and-shack music whined 
and thumped. 

Sutherland said “Thanks,” re- 
membered that once again he’d for- 
gotten to turn his radio on, and de- 
cided that he didn’t care. 

Mr. Mookerjan drifted over and 
joined him. “The war, eh? Good. 
Let’s see how long we have to dance 
in the citadel while the Red Death 
roams outside.” 

Sutherland glanced at him quick- 



ly, but Mookerjan’s pale-olive face 
was pleasantly blank. 

The program was in stereo color 
and the timing was perfect; the 
animated commercial was just end- 
ing and the news commentator ajj- 
peared, picking up his wand and 
pointing to a wall map. 

A fleet action had been fought 
off Way Rock — though why any- 
one should fight for a Moon-sized 
hunk of frozen slag a light-year and 
a half from any warming star was 
more than Sutherland could imag- 
ine. There was, of course, no vic- 
tory; the ships had shot at each 
other for a while, then lost contact 
in hyperspace evasive action. More 
than eight hundred planet-smash- 
ers had been launched at the enemy 
in the previous twenty-four hours. 
It was expected that the first 
enemy missiles would start explod- 
ing at various points in the Sol sys- 
tem within two weeks. 

The commentator at that point 
disappeared, though his voice re- 
mained, as the vision tank filled 
with a perspective star map, all 
the stellar bodies bright dots of 
light in flashing color. 

Colonel Blick bawled from the 
gun , room: “What’s all the racket 
in there? We can’t hear ourselves 
think!” 

Self-consciously, Berl Sutherland 
switched off the set. Colonel Blick 
appeared, tugging fretfully at his 
soft pale beard. 

“Sorry,” he grumbled, “but real- 

173 



WAY UP YONDER 



ly! That’s Grogan’s latest we were 
playing and you know how distract- 
ing it is to hear a lot of jibber-jab- 
ber when he’s roaring.” 

“Of course,” said Sutherland. He 
wasn’t a roar-and-shacker, but he 
knew that the idea was that the 
music itself was supposed to be 
formless, empty; it was the listener 
himself who filled in the meaning. 

“Kept thinking it was a damn 
John Philip Sousa March,” com- 
plained the colonel. “Fine thing! 
Confounded war makes enough 
trouble. I don’t want it busting into 
my music!” 

“I’m sorry,” said Sutherland. 
This was, after all, Thelma’s 
brother and the head of the family. 
“The set’s off. You can go ahead 
with your tape if you want to.” 

The colonel threw himself into a 
chair, breathing hard. “Later,” he 
said. “Oh, that roar! You have to 
come and hear it for yourself, 
Sutherland. But let me get my 
breath first. Grogan takes a lot out 
of you, you know. There’s plenty of 
them that can put out a dull beat, 
but for real emptiness there’s no- 
body like Grogan.” 

SUTHERLAND looked quickly 
^ around the room, remember- 
ing. 

It was the first chance he’d had 
to talk to the colonel, but it was a 
fine chance; Blick was sitting there 
and no one else was talking. Moo- 
kerjan had picked up a magazine. 



and apart from him there seemed 
no possibility of interruption. 
Sutherland cleared his throat. 
“Sir,” he began, choked on it — 
the colonel was only nineteen years 
old, after all! “Colonel, that is, I’ve 
been wanting a word with you.” 
“Shoot, man. Roar away.” 

“Back on Earth,” Sutherland said 
rapidly, “I knew your sister in 
school. Well, we were drawn to 
each other. She’s a wonderful girl. 
Colonel Blick, and—” 

“Say,” said Blick, sitting up, 
“where is Thelma? You know, 
Mookerjan?” 

The olive-colored man looked 
up from his magazine long enough 
to shake his head. 

“Robin!” Across the room, the 
elder sister turned around. “You 
seen Thelma?” 

“She isn’t back yet,” Robin Blick 
called. 

“Damn it all,” complained the 
colonel, sinking back, “I wish she’d 
stay around the house long enough 
to tell me what to do about Pat 
Grossfader. You’re a friend of hers, 
Mr. Sutherland — maybe you can 
talk to her. Here she’s supposed to 
marry Pat next month, and she’s 
out alley-catting with every man 
imder the age of ninety on Lee. 
Pat’s not going to let her get away 
with that forever, Sutherland.” 
"Supposed,” repeated Suther- 
land carefully, the words chipping 
out of his mouth like bits of ice, 
“supposed to — to marry — ?” 



174

175 



“He’s put up with plenty from 
her already,” growled the colonel, 
tugging fretfully at his beard. “I 
wouldn’t blame him if he called the 
whole thing off! That Mancini boy. 
That wasn’t bad enough. Or the 
time she and George Henry Twy- 
fort ran out of rocket fuel and 
stayed in orbit all night.” 

Sutherland said, with an expen- 
sive effort to make it sound calm 
and clear: “You say Thelma’s go- 
ing to ma— to ma— ” 

“And the trouble is, Sutherland, 
it’s important. Pat’s land is right 
next to ours. We have to think 
about the next generation.” 

“Sure you do,” said Sutherland 
at once, without the faintest idea 
what he was agreeing to. His mind 
was suddenly stopped dead in its 
tracks; it refused to move past the 
word “marry.” 

“I suppose,” said the colonel re- 
flectively, “that Pat wouldn’t kick 
up too much of a fuss about Twy- 
fort if it wasn’t that the boy thinks 
Thelma’s going to marry him. 
That’ll shack you! Marry him, and 
he doesn’t have a foot of land to call 
his own!” 

“I think,” Sutherland said care- 
fully, “that I’ll just take a little 
stroll around the grounds.” 

He got up and staggered off. The 
colonel stared after him, then 
shrugged. 

“Nice fellow,” he said to Miguel 
Mookerjan. “Wonder why Thelma 
invited him here.” 



¥ N a wing chair before the fire, 
Sutherland hardly heard the 
others come into the gun room, and 
they didn’t notice him. That was 
fine — he had a good deal of fire- 
staring to do. Married! 

Dimly, he heard the voice of the 
colonel, enthusiastically piping: 
“You’ll like this, LaFargue. Music 
to Feel By. Oh, that Grogan!” 

A click and a whir of reels, and 
a bagpipe drone snarled out from 
the multiphonic speakers spotted 
around the walls of the gun room. 
Curse their nonsense, Sutherland 
mumbled to himself; but it was 
easier to stay there and listen than 
to get up and move. And once he 
gave the music a chance to work 
on him, it had something. 

Drone, drone; no, it wasn’t like 
a bagpipe, or at least not like the 
skirling bagpipe melodies. It had 
only enough variation of pitch to 
suggest that it was music and not a 
distant fire siren. It made him think 
of something, Sutherland thought 
drowsily, of — of weddings? Yes. 
Certainly there was a touch of 
Mendelssohn right there— or some- 
thing that might have suggested 
something that was Mendelssohn. 
Weddings, and bridesmaids in pink 
and yellow, and Thelma down the 
aisle, dewy and delightful, and him- 
self in a starchy collar and striped 
pants— 

He caught himself. But he began 
to see just what it was the fans 
liked about roar-and-shack. 



176 



GALAXY 



When the spinning tape-end had 
flick-ilick-flicked itself to a stop, 
Sutherland was feeling relatively 
good. Well, that was what roar-and- 
shack was for, too. It brought what 
was inside you out to the surface, 
where you could get at it and 
handle it 

He. listened, hardly thinking of 
Thelma at all, to Colonel Blick’s 
breathless: “Roar, man, roar! Oh, 
what a lip that Grogan has!” 

“Very nice,” said LaFargue’s 
voice. “A touch classical, wouldn't 
you say? Beethoven’s Sixth— green 
fields and a gathering storm, all that 
sort of thing. And—” the voice be- 
came measurably brisker — “that’s 
what I want to talk to you about, 
Blick.” 

“Eh?” 

“There’s a storm gathering. Don’t 
you know you’re right in the mid- 
dle of it?” 

“Oh, Sam,” protested the colo- 
nel’s voice with faint indignation. 
“Did you come here to nag me 
about that shortage again? I know 
there’s a war on.” 

“You don’t act it,” said LaFargue 
in a cold, scolding tone. “You plan- 
tation colonels act as though the 
Universe was staked down to bed- 
rock. Nothing’s going to change, is 
that it? The way Daddy did things 
is fine, because everything’s always 
going to be the same as it was in 
Daddy’s day.” 

Colonel Blick sighed wistfully. 
“I’ve got a couple other Grogans 



here,” he offered, but not as though 
he thought LaFargue would take 
him up on it. 

“No! Why can’t you get the crops 
out?” 

Silence, except for the colonel’s 
sad breathing. 

“I’ll tell you why,” said La- 
Fargue. “There isn’t a plantation on 
Lee that’s met its quota for three 
months. Crops rot in the fields. 
Spuds spoil in storage. The robots 
aren’t doing the job, Blick. It’s up 
to you plantation colonels to get 
out there and straighten them out.” 
“Mr. LaFargue!” 

“Or would you rather,” LaFargue 
inquired, “let the Cafiellans- march 
in and do it for you? Because if 
Lee doesn’t meet its quotas. Earth 
isn’t going to be able to eat, let 
alone feed its fighting men.” 

“Oh, damn it,” cried the colonel, 
“it isn’t only us, you know.” 

“I know. That’s the bad part. 
Pershing’s iron mines report one 
breakdown after another. In the Al- 
debaranian system, all the remote- 
operated planets are getting out of 
hand. I don’t know, Blick, maybe 
we’re getting too soft; maybe we’ve 
given the robots more than they can 
handle. But it’s up to us humans to 
step in and set things straight. I’m 
telling you this for your own good. 
If you colonels don’t do it volun- 
tarily, the government’s going to 
have to step in.” 

Colonel Blick said frostily: 
“Thank you for your comments.

177 



Mr. LaFargue. Is there anything 
else? No? Then, with your permis- 
sion, I’ll return to my other guests.” 

R obin BUck looked in the gun 
room and said: “Oh, there you 
are. We’ve been looking for you.” 
Sutherland leaned forward, re- 
covered himself, blinked and set 
down the glass. “We?” 

“The servants helped me," Robin 
said impatiently, taking in the 
glass and the low-water mark on 
the brandy decanter. “You can go 
now,” she said into the microphone 
on her shoulder set. “Mr. Suther- 
land’s here.” 

Thestt were half a dozen robots 
with her, Sutherland saw blurrily. 
Confounded things, he thought, he 
wished they looked more like peo- 
ple. Or less. They were all of a pat- 
tern; only the coloring of the 
enamel on their faces and torsoes 
distinguished them — that and the 
name that was neatly lettered 
across each chest. There was a pur- 
ple-and- white-checked Vespasian 
and a blue-polka-dot Theseus, a 
Ganymede in shades of brown and 
tan, an Echo in green. 

“I thought,” said Robin, distract- 
ing him from the retreating robots, 
“that you’d like to know that Thel- 
ma’s back.” 

“Oh, fine,” said Sutherland, 
frowning. 

“My sister.” 

“Oh, that Thelma,” said Suther- 
land agreeably, and stood up. 

178 



“Well. Let’s go see that Thelma,” 
he said, taking her arm. 

For some reason, this mousy girl 
named Robin seemed to be impa- 
tient with him, Sutherland noticed. 
That was most annoying of her. If 
she couldn’t be a lady and polite to 
her guests, then what the devil kind 
of family was this anyway? A mu- 
sic-mad teen-ager posing as the 
head of the household, a rude old 
maid of every bit of twenty-three 
bossing the company around, and 
a faithless, heartless— 

“Are you all right, Mr. Suther- 
land?” 

“Fine,” he said emptily. 

“I thought I heard you grunt or 
something.” 

“I’m fine,” he insisted. “That’s 
what I said, isn’t it? Now where’s 
Thelma?” 

They were back in the great 
manorial hall and the colonel was 
holding forth. Not on Grogan and 
his meltingly empty horn this time, 
but on Lee and its place in the war 
effort. 

“The mother planet,” he was say- 
ing pontifically, “has nothing to 
fear. We’ll do our part! No Earth- 
man will go hungry in this war.” 

LaFargue, keeping an obviously 
tight rein on his tongue, said brief- 
ly: “And if the Capellans occupy 
you?” 

“Occupy?” repeated the colonel, 
stupified and staring. “Occupy us? 
The Capellans?” And he burst out 
laughing. “Oh, very amusing, La- 



GALAXY 



Fargue. What do you think of that, 
friends? Lee occupied!” 

1^ VEN Mr. Mookerjan giggled 
shrilly. LaFargue said dogged- 
ly: “It’s not impossible.” 

Somebody spoke Sutherland’s 
name, but he wasn’t interested. 
He’d heard the same talk, between 
the same two men, an hour earlier, 
and wasn’t interested in the recap. 
What he was interested in was 
Thelma. 

He said; “Where is she? Thelma, 
I mean.” 

Everyone turned and looked at 
him. Mr. Mookerjan giggled again. 
“Why, I saw her out on the terrace 
with-” 

“She stepped out,” said Robin, 
hard and fast, catching an expres- 
sion on her brother’s face. “She’ll 
be back, Mr. Sutherland, so why 
don’t you sit down and have a 
drink?” 

Sutherland blinked. “Terrace, 
eh? Well,” he said raising his voice, 
“I just feel the need of a little fresh 
air myself, and what do you think 
of that?” 

The nerve, he told himself ag- 
grievedly, of these frontier-planet 
civilians, trying to pull the wool 
over his eyes. Yes, civilians! “Col- 
onel” was only a courtesy title that 
went along with inheriting the 
plantation. What did young Blick 
or his pasty-faced friends know 
about war? From his towering 
seniority as an almost-sworn-in. 



soon-to-be-inducted draftee, Suth- 
erland looked down on them with 
irritation and contempt, and he 
marched across the room and out 
the French windows. 

“Thelma!” he shouted. 

The terrace was empty. Not 
even their intelligence was any 
good, he told himself, grieving. 

“Thelma!” he cried again, and 
walked out into the gardens. 

“Thelma!” he roared, and cir- 
cled the little pond, and then he 
saw her. Or them. 

“Oh, you rat!” said Sutherland, 
and hurled himself at the man with 
his arms around the woman Suth- 
erland loved. “I don’t care how 
much money you’ve got, Pat Gross- 
fader — Thelma loves me and she 
isn’t going to marry you!” 

“Wait, buddy!” The man dodged 
away from the flailing fists. “Hey! 
You got the wrong man! I’m Char- 
ley Pough, from Cornell! I never 
saw Miss Blick before tonight!” 
Sutherland said: “You cad!” He 
looked at the smeared lipstick and 
the disarrayed hair of Thelma 
Blick. “Hussy!” he cried. “Faith- 
less woman! You aren’t even true 
to Pat Grossfader, let alone me!” 
And he wandered off into the 
night.

i^VERHEAD, the unfamiliar

canopy. It was full dark. The even- 
ing rain had already come and 
gone; now the fertile ground would 
steep in moisture until the morning, 
when bright Sirius would pour its 
heat and light into the making of 
another five inches of stalk, another 
quarter-inch of girth of tuber, of 
each plant on the Blick place. 

Sutherland wandered until some- 
thing moved in the shadows in front 
of him. 

He jumped. “Who’s there?” 

No answer. 

“Speak up!” he barked, and then 
he remembered what he was al- 
ways forgetting, and touched the 
switch of the speaker at his shoul- 
der. 

“Who’s there?” he demanded 
again, and now the radio received 
and relayed his voice. 

“Apollonius, please, Sutherland 
Master,” whispered the speaker on 
his shoulder softly, and a green- 
and-white-striped robot stood be- 
fore him, scanning him with its 
great silver radar eyes. “Are you 
lost, Sutherland Master?” 

“Lost and damned forever,” 
groaned Sutherland. 

“Do you want Apollonius to take 
you to the house?” whispered the 
radio voice, soft and sexless. 

“No, damn you.” Ugly wretched 
little thing. “Get out of here. Leave 
me alone!” 

“Yes, Sutherland Master.” The 
four-foot mannikin obediently 
wheeled and disappeared. 



Good, thought Sutherland sour- 
ly, glowering after it in the dark — 
can’t stand the things. 

Still, he thought, he might as 
well go back to the house. Faithless 
woman! But he couldn’t stand out 
here all night. No, back to the house 
and up to his room. There was a 
lock on the door; he would use it. 
Speak to no one. Ignore the whole 
confounded mass of them. Then up 
early the next morning, get one of 
the servants to drive him to town, 
catch a plane to the spaceport and— 

Say, he thought drearily, staring 
around at the trees, just where was 
the house? 

IJE called uncomfortably: “Hey, 
Apollonius, or whatever your 
name is!” 

There wasn’t any answer. 

“Oh, damn,” said Sutherland, ir- 
ritated, and snapped the switch off. 
Never mind the robots; they were 
as obnoxious as their owners. It was 
impossible to be lost, he reassured 
himself— that is, really lost. True, 
he didn’t know where he was, but 
that was only a detail. All he had 
to do was to go in one direction and 
keep right on going. Any direction 
— the way out of a wood is straight 
ahead, and once he was outside, 
he’d see the house or the dome, and 
either would orient him. 

The robot had gone that way. 
Well, it was as good a way as any. 
Sutherland trudged after. 

In a moment, he saw where the 



180 



GALAXY 



robot had been heading, and it 
wasn’t toward the house at all. It 
was an entrance to the servants’ 
quarters underground. It wasn’t 
lighted and there was no one in 
sight, but it was perfectly clear in 
the dim orangy glow from the over- 
head stars. 

Sutherland hesitated. “Apollon- 
ius,” he called weakly, but there 
wasn’t any answer. 

Undoubtedly, he thought, the 
tunnel through the servants’ quar- 
ters was the quickest way back to 
the house. 

^ I ■’ HE tunnel was dark — more 
-*■ than dark; it was absolute black- 
ness. He could form no idea of its 
height or length. He hesitated for a 
while, the drink receding inside 
him, wondering whether, after all, 
it was such a good idea to entrust 
himself to an unknown pit whose 
only inhabitants would be hateful 
animalcules. 

But the drink was not all gone. 
And Sutherland didn’t care. If 
Thelma was lost to him, what had 
life to offer? 

Resting one hand against a wall, 
he carefully advanced. In a dozen 
paces, he was completely blind, but 
he remembered his cigarette light- 
er;, flicked it on, found the tunnel 
was perfectly plain and empty; 
flicked it off and marched confi- 
dently ahead. 

Strange sounds stopped him. 

Funny, thought Sutherland, was 



it an army marching at route step 
or a dance troupe? More than 
either of those, it was like the ir- 
regular crash of raindrops on the 
sodden fabric of a tent, a sound 
without timbre, only a multiplied 
pat-a-pat-a-pat. He moved a few 
yards farther until the noises were 
close at hand; then flicked on the 
lighter once more. 

In the tiny flare, he saw a serpen- 
tine circle of shining bodies. Robots 
— the house and garden robots, and 
they were — why, dancing! 

Dancing! 

They circled about a chamber 
of the underground quarters and 
processing works, circled, spun, 
slipped and slithered in and out 
of a queerly limited pattern, like 
cod flopping about in a fisherman’s 
basket. Their silvery radar orbs 
rolled endlessly. Their linked 
metal limbs waved and clutched. 

Dancing, thought Sutherland, 
dazed — no one told me robots 
danced. 

It could have been the rain dance 
of chrome-plated Indian children. 
It could have been the sacrificial 
rites of some island cannibals. But 
it lacked one human attribute that 
made it very strange indeed. 

It was silent. 

No music; none at all. There 
wasn’t the thumping of a gasoline- 
tin drum, or the shrill of a reed fife; 
there wasn’t any sound of breath or 
chanting. These were robots, not 
men. And if they danced to music.

it was to a tune Sutherland could 
not hear. 

Could not hear? 

“Oh, curse the thing,” he growled 
aloud, and snapped on the shoul- 
der radio. 

Immediately a clashing squeal of 
static beat at his ear. Music, yes — 



the robots were dancing to radio 
frequencies, inaudible to human 
ears. 

They were in the processing 
chambers under the ground, 
Sutherland realized, the places 
where the proto-spuds were cooked, 
shredded, worked and packed. 






>yasii 



He let the little flare go out, but 
there was some light, he found — 
not much, but enough to pick out 
highlights on the metallic figures, 
and presently there was more — 
all he needed. 

The light came from the process- 
ing machinery. 




OBOTS needed no light to 
work by, not while their radar 
eyes bounced echoes off masses; 
but the machinery had not been 
built with robots in mind but with 
men. It was part of their design that 
the lights of their gauges and 
meters should tell human eyes the 
temperatures and pressures and 
R.P.M. and voltages and other 
operating indicia of the machines, 
and faint as they were, those tiny 
instrument lights illuminated the 
scene. And the robots were start- 
ing the machines, one after another. 

Purple lights raced across the 
face of a pressure cooker as a 
small brown-spotted robot moved 
a vernier with ritual precision. A 
panel of instrument dials on a 
freezer lighted up with blue and 
yellow and red sparks. A shredding 
machine groaned and chugged and 
began to spin, and over its blades 
a warning red glow gave notice that 
human fingers should not approach. 

Sutherland stood staring, for 
there was something here that 
struck home. 

The sounds in his radio — yes, 
they were clear enough; they came 
from the machines. The oscillating 
squee in his ear kept time to the 
movement of the chopper blades. 
A rhythmic ping, ping, ping 
matched the strokes of the com- 
pressor that fed ground stalks to the 
cooker. 

In fifteen years or more, how- 
ever long it had been since a hu- 

183 




man being had troubled to enter 
the underground troll-world of the 
robots, the electrical machinery 
had worn. Once-firm contacts had 
corroded and warped. Each ma- 
chine was now a potent generator 
of radio static — short-range, to be 
sure, because of grounding and the 
buried location of the plant — but 
loud enough close at hand for the 
robots to hear. And it was radio 
that the robots lived by. 

Why, the sound of the grinder 
was a dance beat What must the 
gamma-ray generators sound like! 
What tunes must come from the 
conveyor belts and the air compres- 
sors! 

It was dance music, savage and 
primitive. 

It was voodoo. 

Staring, Sutherland thought of 
servile peoples and their customs. 
In all Earth’s history, the slave pop)- 
ulation had always its religion and 
its ritual. 

Why shouldn’t robots have them 
as well? 

There was only one answer to 
that question — it wasn’t a ques- 
tion; it was a fact. The robots 
danced to the music they lived by, 
and though the steel and enamel 
faces showed no expression, there 
was emotion enough for a Haitian 
conjure ceremony in the stamp of 
metal feet and the frenzy of metal 
arms. 

He turned blindly and fled down 
the dark tunnel, careless that he 



barked his shins and scraped his 
knuckles, and even out in the cool 
fruit grove with the orange-tinted 
stars above, he could feel something 
closing in on him more weighty and 
more frightening than the pressure 
of rock above the robot warren. 

V 

S UTHERLAND woke up, and 
clutched his head, and groaned. 
What a dream! All that brandy and 
the tumult of his emotions regard- 
ing Thelma Blick had combined to 
produce a hangover, a massive 
drunk, strange dreams . 
Dreams? 

He sat up suddenly. The maid 
robot was moving silently about 
the room. From under his pillow, 
the robot voice sang : “Good morn- 
ing, Sutherland Master. Here is 
your julep.” 

Sutherland stared at her, trying 
to remember. Dreams? Had it been 
a dream, the weird robot witch- 
dance in the tunnel? 

No, he was sure. It was no 
dream; Persephone was one of the 
capering corybants. Her colors, 
brown spots on a silvery field — he 
remembered them; the one that 
operated the pressure cooker, he 
thought, tapping switches, treading 
on valve-pedals, like a tympanist 
beating out hot riffs. 

He stared at the robot, but what 
was there to say? He ignored the 
julep and sat up. 



184 



GALAXY 



Quickly the robot was beside 
him, helping him into his robe, ad- 
justing the little shoulder-radio, 
knotting his sash. 

“Get lost,” he growled. 

The expressionless face hesi- 
tated; then Persephone went 
about her dusting-tidying duties. 
You could almost see the electrons 
cascading around the digital robot 
mind : Get lost? A figure of human 
speech. Not to be taken literally. 
Means: “Do not disturb at this 
time.” 

Sutherland dragged himself to 
the bath. 

Behind the closed door, he 
switched on the shower and 
watched it cycling — hot, cold, 
steaming, suds, rinse — inside the 
stall. Steam billowed around him. 

“Oh, damn,” he groaned. Why 
must life be so complicated? The 
girl he loved — faithless. The war 
that was about to consume him — 
treated here as though it did not 
exist — in spite of the manifest im- 
portance of Lee and its produce to 
Earth’s war effort. His host a roar- 
and-shack devotee. 

Everything was all messed up. 

“Oh, damn,” he growled again, 
staring at his face in the shaving 
mirror. 

It was a perfectly decent face; 
why couldn’t Thelma learn to like 
it? Nothing special, of course, he 
admitted, but — 

“She’s nuts,” he grumbled testily. 
“Thelma promised to marry me. 



I’d give anything to make her do it. 
I-” 

There was a light sharp tapping 
at the door, and a gentle murmur 
from the shoulder radio: “Suther- 
land Master?” 

Startled, he opened the door. 
Persephone stood there, the blind 
silvery radar orbs scanning him 
emptily. He said irritably: “What 
the devil do you want?” 

“Sutherland Master,” purred the 
robot, “exactly what do you mean 
by ‘anything’?” 

ILFASTILY dressed, full of what 
he had to say, Sutherland hur- 
ried to the breakfast room with Per- 
sephone in tow. 

LaFargue was silently seated 
near the door, a newspaper open in 
his lap. He looked up opaquely in 
his dark glasses as Sutherland came 
in, but said nothing. There was a 
commotion in the room; the colonel 
was pacing tautly about, grumbling, 
a fidget of nerves in flesh! “Oh, 
where is he? Do you think his cop- 
ter could have crashed?” 

“Please,” murmured one of the 
other young officers, slopping his 
coffee as his hands shook, “don’t be 
nervous. There couldn’t have been 
an accident.” He dropped his cup 
crashing to the floor. 

“What’s the matter?” demanded 
Sutherland. 

The colonel stared at him. “Oh,” 
he said, identifying this stranger. 
“You. Well, it’s Grogan. He’s com- 



WAY UP YONDER 



185 



ing here! Can you believe it?” 
Sutherland said sharply : “That’s 
fine, but there’s something more 
important going on.” 

“More important than Gro—” 
“Colonel,” Sutherland inter- 
rupted, “I must ask that no one 
leave this room. Especially you, 
Mr. Mookerjan.” The little man 
looked up with his bland face po- 
litely curious; he was sitting on a 
hassock by the window, quietly but- 
tering toast. “I want you to listen 
to this. Colonel. Persephone, come 
here.” 

Obediently the maid robot came 
to him. The colonel fussed: “Not 
now, old chap. Please. Grogan’s 
coming any minute, and — Oh, I 
can’t bear it if something happened 
to him! He was all set to go back 
to Mars. If there’s an accident com- 
ing here, when he only came be- 
cause I asked him, I couldn’t bear 
it.” 

Sutherland said steadily: “This 
is more important than Grogan. I 
have reason to believe that your 
robots are conspiring against you.” 
The colonel whispered: “My 
word. What' an idea!” He glanced 
at his friends, shaking his head. 
“It’s a fact. Colonel.” 

Sutherland observed that, on the 
hassock by the window, Miguel 
Mookerjan’s face was turned away. 
The butter knife was rigidly still in 
his hand. Thelma and Robin 
seemed politely curious. LaFargue, 
his eyes invisible, had quietly come 



closer. All the others in the room 
clearly thought he was mad. 

“Listen,” said Sutherland. “Per- 
sephone! I have a problem. I love 
Thelma Blick, but she doesn’t love 
me. 

He turned up the volume on his 
shoulder radio, so that all might 
hear. The purring voice of the robot 
blasted in his ear: “OH, TOO 
BAD, SUTHERLAND MAS- 
TER,” it roared sweetly. “MISS 
THELMA HAS OWN PLANS, 
WE PEOPLE EXPECT. MANY 
MASTERS ARE SAD BE- 
CAUSE MISS THELMA DOES 
NOT LOVE THEM.” 

“But isn’t it true that many mas- 
ters are happy, too?” 

“CERTAINLY, SUTHER- 
LAND MASTER,” agreed the ro- 
bot. 

“And couldn’t you people help 
me to make her love me?” 

TT was out. Even after what the 
robot had told him in his own 
room, Sutherland winced to hear 
the words come from his own 
mouth. Help him! It was the mad- 
dest sort of request. It was like ask- 
ing a vacuum cleaner to touch for 
King’s Evil, or a dishwasher to 
mesmerize a headache away. 

The sweetly sexless voice of the 
robot bargained: “YOU MUST 
GIVE US PEOPLE SOME- 
THING IF WE HELP YOU. 
MOOKERJAN MASTER AL- 
WAYS DID.”

“Thank you, Persephone,” 
sighed Sutherland with relief, and 
clicked off his set. 

He confronted the colonel. “Now 
what do you say, Blick? You see?” 

“I-” faltered the boy, “I - I’m 
afraid I don’t.” 

But if the colonel failed to un- 
derstand Sutherland’s meaning, 
there was someone in the room who 
did not 

Miguel Mookerjan stood up and 
his hand was in the pocket of his 
robe. He wasn’t a tall man and he 
looked rather like a plump little 
dachshund pup, but he was no fig- 
ure of fun as he advanced toward 
Sutherland. 

“You should not have meddled,” 
he said gently. “It was foolish.” 

“Don’t try anything rash!” Suth- 
erland warned sharply. But he 
wondered how he could back up 
the warning. If Mookerjan had a 
gun, it gave him a certain definite 
edge. Certainly Sutherland could 
count on no help from the colonel, 
who was in a paralysis of surprise. 
Only LaFargue could be hoped for 
at all, and LaFargue seemed con- 
tent to stand quietly by and watch. 

Mookerjan said softly: “I am 
never rash, Mr. Sutherland. It is 
not a characteristic of my family. 
Conservative, quick to learn, pro- 
lific, thrifty — those are the traits 
that have made my family great 
We,” he said proudly, “were one of 
the most numerous families in Gra- 
nada, many centuries ago. Then 



we moved to Puerto Rico as Spain 
grew too crowded, from over- 
crowded Puerto Rico to New 
Delhi, from India to ” 

“To Cap>ella?” ventured Suther- 
land. 

Mookerjan looked at him 
thoughtfully. The accusation was 
plain. Sutherland was saying: 
You’re a spy. 

The little man smiled apologe- 
tically and nodded. “I rather 
thought you realized I was a Capel- 
lan,” he said with a touch of sad- 
ness. “Knowing that, you must 
know why I am here. That is too 
bad. There are a hundred like me 
on Lee, commission brokers or 
wandering journalists or doctors, 
as the spirit moves us to pretend. 
It is not convenient for us that you 
should know we exist, although it 
can scarcely defeat our purpose.” 

“And exactly what is your pur- 
pose?” Sutherland demanded. 

Mookerjan sighed. “That should 
be obvious,” he said softly. 

Sutherland spun and confronted 
Colonel Blick. “You see? Spies! 
Using your robots to work against 
your government! And not above 
using them, too, to help out with 
their own little romantic intrigues. 
I’ll bet!” And he glanced at Thelma 
Blick, who seemed perfectly com- 
posed, thoughtful, disinterested — 
she was idly examining her nails — 
but who was blushing beet red. 

Colonel Blick cast a glance at 
his watch, a glance at the door, 



188 



GALAXY 



frowned, and then obviously set his 
mind to the problem at hand. 

“All right,” he said irritably. 
“You’ve made your point, Suther- 
land. What about it?” 

Sutherland blinked. "What 
“Mr. Mookerjan is a spy, you 
say. Isn’t that a matter for the 
Space Guard?” 

“It’s a matter for every decent 
citizen of Earth!” Sutherland 
blazed. 

“Oh, of course,” the colonel 
agreed. “But my planet is Lee, Mr. 
Sutherland. It isn’t a state or a 
nation. It’s a colony.” 

Sutherland stopped short, the 
breath gone out of him. Incredible! 

“And besides,” said the colonel, 
his voice suddenly joyful, “I hear 
— yes! I hear a copter, coming 
through the dome port!” 

He went flying to the door and 
that was the end of that discussion. 
Grogan was here. 

SUTHERLAND stood in a 
corner of the room, watching 
the triumphal entry of the hero. 
For a few minutes, he had been the 
center of attraction; now he was 
ignored in the wings. What had 
happened? He stared at the colonel 
with sick disbelief. How could the 
man be so thoughtless, heedless, 
careless — so stupid? 

LaFargue whispered from be- 
hind him: “Too bad, Sutherland. 
You tried.” 

“Eh?” Sutherland turned and 



looked at him, but the eyes were 
invisible behind the glasses. “Yeah,” 
he said, and looked again at Gro- 
gan, smiling and nodding, serene 
with the affable dignity of someone 
who knows he is the greatest man 
in the group. 

“Play something, Grogan!” 
begged the colonel, beside himself 
with excitement. “Oh, roar, man!” 

Robin Blick whispered: “You’re 
perfectly right, you know.” 

Sutherland stared. She was there 
too, beside LaFargue. “Sure,” he 
said. 

Off by the window, Miguel 
Mookerjan had retired to his has- 
sock and his cold toast, but his cold, 
bland eyes stayed on Sutherland. 
Sutherland sighed. 

“Play,” coaxed the colonel, and 
Grogan held up his hand, laughing. 
He was a big man, fair and fat, with 
short red hair and a plump red face. 

“I didn’t bring the pipe,” he said, 
“but I tell you what I can do, pal. 
Want to hear my newest? I got 
the tape. Right here.” 

“Oh, splendid,” moaned the colo- 
nel, half carried away with joy, 
and they hastened to set the tape 
machine up in the great hall. 

“Sit down,” LaFargue said soft- 
ly. “Look.” He was holding out 
something that glistened ruby — a 
red-plastic I.D. card, an officer of 
the Space Guard. 

Sutherland’s eyes opened wide. 

Robin Blick glanced, and she 
was surprised too; but she said: “I

189 



should have known. But really, I 
don’t know what you can do here, 
Mr. LaFargue.” 

LaFargue said harshly: “Noth- 
ing, probably. That’s what I’ve 
been able to accomplish so far. 
Why should it change now? But I 
have to try. What about this robot 
voodoo, Sutherland?” 

“Oh, I can tell you more than 
he can,” sniffed the girl. “Silly non- 
sense. The people — the robots, 
that is — have their own secret rites. 
Well, it keeps them contented. I 
suppose it’s like that in any slave 
society,” she admitted, flushing. 
“That’s what this is, after all. But 
you mustn’t think too badly of us. 
Plantation masters are decorations, 
nothing more. We sit around and 
the men drink juleps and the girls 
enjoy all the flirtations they can. 
And if once in a while somebody 
uses a little robot voodoo as a sort 
of love potion, what’s the harm in 
that?” 

Sutherland asked: “But how—” 

“Ssh.” She waved to the knot 
around the tape player. “Don’t dis- 
tract my brother now. Let him get 
his tape going. In the past decades,” 
she lectured, resuming, “the robots 
grew away from the humans. There 
was no common ground of culture 
or interest. The robots worked 
while we loafed, and naturally they 
developed their own little customs. 
Voodoo dances, charms, magic — 
harmless enough, of course. They 
wouldn’t hurt anyone. How could 



they? Robots aren’t designed to 
hurt humans.” 

“But the charms work!” Suther- 
land yelped. 

Robin Blick looked surprised. 
“Of course.” 

Sutherland and LaFargue looked 
at each other. 

Sutherland said urgently: 
“Robin this is important. Don’t you 
see what’s happening here? The 
whole Sirian system is falling down 
on the job. Maybe your robots 
have something to do with it How 
do the charms work?” 

“Why, sub-aural compulsion,” 
said the girl, surprised. “Didn’t you 
know?” 

tuneless bagpipe drone of 
Grogan’s latest wailed through 
the room. Sutherland started over 
to the knot around the tape ma- 
chine, hesitated, looked at La- 
Fargue. 

“Go on!” LaFargue whispered 
hotly. “Do it now!” 

Sutherland nodded and reluc- 
tantly started over. Well, he 
thought, what did he have to lose? 
Casually LaFargue got up and fol- 
lowed him. 

“Say,” said Sutherland enthusi- 
astically, “that’s what I call roar- 
ing!” 

The colonel looked at him first 
limply, then irritably. “Quiet!” 

“Sorry,” murmured Sutherland, 
and worked his way closer to the 
machine.

All around it the audience was 
sprawled, boneless and tranced, in 
chairs and sofas; they were really 
sent. In fact, Sutherland realized, 
it was getting him too. He was 
being lulled to relaxation and to 
dreams. He took a deep breath, 
glanced once at LaFargue, and 
kicked the tape player’s plug out 
of its socket. 

The Grogan roar blipped and 
died. The colonel twitched and sat 
up. "What 

“Oh, sorry,” apologized Suther- 
land. “Clumsy of me! But Mr. La- 
Fargue here will fix it — won’t you? 
He’s an expert on — on electronic 
things.” 

The colonel gave him a look of 
intense pain. “Hurry it up, La- 
Fargue,” he grumbled. 

“I can’t wait to hear the rest of 
it,” Sutherland chattered while La- 
Fargue busied himself with the 
player. “He’s great.” 

The colonel blinked. “Your 
taste does you credit,” he said 
sourly. “Astonishing how it’s im- 
proved.” 

“What? Oh. Yes,” said Suther- 
land, trying not to seem too vitally 
interested in what LaFargue was 
doing. 

All the thing really needed, of 
course, was to put the plug back in 
the socket, and if LaFargue took 
too long, it would be only a matter 
of time before the colonel or anoth- 
er of them took the task away from 
him. But LaFargue was thorough. 



He peered into the open back of 
the set, hesitated, moved a dial, 
peered again. 

“Come on!” growled the colonel. 
LaFargue stood up, thought for 
a second, and nodded. 

“All right,” he said. “Turn it on.” 
“The plug!” Sutherland whis- 
pered. 

“Oh, of course.” LaFargue bent 
and stuck it back in. As he came 
up, he said softly: “I cut out every- 
thing but the very highs and the 
very lows. Let’s see what happens.” 
The tape began to mumble ai»d 
squeak. LaFargue listened care- 
fully for a second, then cried: 
“That’s it! The high is just over- 
tones — wait a second!” Quickly 
he turned the treble dial; the 
squeaking died. “But the low — 
here, let’s have more volume.” 

He turned it up. 

A dispassionate deep voice came 
compellingly from the speaker: 
“Relax. Don’t worry. Take 
things easy. The Capellans won’t 
come here. If they do, so what? 
Earth is far away. Don’t get in- 
volved. Relax. Don’t worry 

“And there,” cried Sutherland 
triumphantly, “is what is buried 
under every Grogan tape! Sub- 
aural compulsion, a hypnotic mes- 
sage that lulls and weakens! Gro- 
gan! I arrest you in the name of 
the Space Guard, as a Capellan spy 
— and the same goes for you, Mi- 
guel Mookerjan!” 

The rest was pandemonium.

191 



Vj^ ELL, they arrested Grogan 
” all right, and Mookerjan too; 
and after a few phone calls made 
by LaFargue, the word came that 
the Space Guard was on its way. 

“Sorry,” said LaFargue hand- 
somely to Sutherland, “but really, 
you can’t arrest them, you know. 
But I’ll see that you get credit 
for it.” 

“I think I’ve got everjdhing I 
want already,” said Sutherland. 

“Oh? Oh. I see,” said LaFargue, 
and went to check on his prisoners. 

The colonel and his cronies said : 
“Uh. Sutherland. We must seem — 
But you know how it is. We’re 
sorry.” 

“Of course,” said Sutherland, 
and bowed as they left. 

Thelma Blick came flying. “You 
were wonderful" she cried, glow- 



ing. “Oh, darling, I’m so proud of 
you! And I’m sure you’ll forgive 
silly old me for — ” 

“I forgive you, Thelma,” said 
Sutherland. “Good-by, Thelma.” 
And he held the door for her. 

She looked at him with popping 
eyes, but there wasn’t any choice. 
She went. 

He turned to look at the mousy 
sister, who was not mousy at all, 
he had previously realized. She 
said tautly: “I thought you came 
here to get married.” 

“I did,” said Sutherland, “and I 
shall.” 

And he took her by the arm 
and marched her out. And though 
she looked surprised, and acted sur- 
prised, the fact of the matter is 
that she wasn’t surprised at all.

. For MIT scientists now are ex- 
perimenting with cryotrons of the 
order of 500 angstroms wide (less 
than the visible wavelength of 
light ). Thus, even if these future 
computer building blocks were 
packed ‘loosely,’ billions of them 
would fit into the ‘infinite’ space of 
a cubic centimeter. And a compo- 
nent only a few cc’s wide could hold 
far more information units than the 
relatively immense human skull 
holds neurons. A cryotron-percep- 
tron, in this sense, would be ‘more 
than human.’ ” Anyone whose mind 



has remained young and open for 
so many years is truly admirable. 
Don’t close it now, when research 
into the mechanics of intelligence 
is moving forward so speedily and 
rewardingly.) 

l^R. Raymond Wallace, Clear- 
field. Pa.; “I agree with the 
apparent trend toward a few long 
stories rather than a lot of short 
ones, but have you taken into con- 
sideration the fact that you always 
loaded the question? . What 
might have happened if you had 
presented the issue as a choice be- 
tween short, sparkling treatments, 
full of wit and rapid action and 
long, slow-moving, page-padding 
anecdotes?” ( Just what did happen 
— the readers who wanted short 
stories for quick breaks and longer 
ones for leisure said so and are 
being heeded ). “I think the reason 
for lack of reaction to your edi- 
torials is that the reader doesn’t 
expect a personal reply, and with- 
out a letter column with editorial 
comments he doesn’t get any an- 
swer either.” (Not if this way of 
handling letters wins favor. Ifs 
pleasant to do. Hope ifs as pleasant 
to read. Is it? ) 

Nora Fields Kerr, Washington, 
D.C.; “In the editorials asking for 
reader votes, you came across as a 
nice guy I wish I’d found on that 
page earlier. Keep on projecting.”
