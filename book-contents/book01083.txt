THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

TRUNK TO TAIL 



XT’S a dismaying lot of years 
^ since I first said, “I’m psick 
of psi pstories,” and yet the pstuff 
pstill comes out of authors. 

This isn’t personal. I would 
fight just as strenuously against 
a takeover by any one theme, 
whatever it might be, at the 
expense of all the others that 
science fiction should explore. 
And I did. There are cycles in 
themes — ypu can get robots 
until you can’t look another in 
the photocell eye, and then comes 
time travel and you wish you had 
some robot stories on hand, and 
so forth. 

An editor who wants science 
fiction to .do its proper job — 
extrapolate into every aspect of 
civilization — sometimes has a 
bit of doing to do. For if the 
cycle is allowed to continue too 
long, science fiction would not 
continue. 

Psi is threatening to do just 
that. Back when it was clear that 
this was no cycle, that it was 
being hauled out of writers, I 
thought, “All right, let’s go get 
smashers that nobody can top! 
Maybe that will bulldoze it out 
of the way so science fiction can 
go forward instead of being made 
to stand still!” Alfred Hester’s 
The Demolished Man should 
have knocked down the wall. It 
did not. Neither did his The Stars 



My Destination nor others that 
ran in Galaxy, going far beyond 
mill-rim psi pstories. And here 
it’s still with us, shoving other 
themes aside. 

Of course psi is a legitimate 
theme and I would run good 
examples of it with no more 
argument than any other. And of 
course I’ve had my share of psi 
experiences. Like what? 

Well, back in World War II, 
there came the Battle of the 
Bulge and our CO gave us the 
“Men, this is it!” talk. As orienta- 
tion man, I had to know the score 
and I, without minimizing the 
seriousness of the Bulge, said it 
was a hopeless military move. 
Our top sergeant, a lovable fel- 
low named Moore, said, “Aw- 
right, wise guy, when is the war 
gonna end?” I felt a ghastly ten- 
sion and out came the words: 
“April 30th.” He demanded a 
bet and $2.50 was the best I 
could scrape up. The war ended 
in Europe May 8th. Moore col- 
lected, but he had to do some of 
his lovable barking not to get 
ganged up on because, at that dis- 
tance, I had been only a week off. 

We were heading for the 
Pacific in a Hog Islander built 
in 1917, too slow for a convoy, 
nothing but a terrier of a de- 
stroyer escort to protect us, and

There had to be a way for Sub-Archivist Clarey to get up in

the world — but this way was right out of the tri-di dramas. 



that reclassification could be 
only in one direction. The ma- 
chine had not originally given 
him a job commensurate with 
his talents; why should it sud- 
denly recognize them? He’d 
known of people who had been 
reclassified — always downward. 
I’m a perfectly competent Sub- 
Archivist, he told himself; I’ll 
fight. 

But he knew fighting wouldn’t 
help. All he had was the right 



SEN T R Y O F T H E SKY 



C LAREY had checked in 
at - Classification Center 
so many times that he 
came now more out of habit than 
hope. He didn’t even look at the 
card that the test machine 
dropped into his hand until he 
was almost to the portway. And 
then he stopped. “Report to 
Room 33 for reclassification,” it 
said. 

Ten years before, Clarey 
would have been ecstatic, sure 



7 



to refuse any job he could claim 
was not in his line; the govern- 
ment would then be obligated to 
continue his existence. There 
were many people who did sub- 
sist on the government dole: the 
aged and the deficient and the 
defective — and creative artists 
who refused to trammel their 
spirits and chose to be ranked 
as Unemployables. Clarey didn’t 
fit into those categories. 

Dispiritedly, he passed along 
innumerable winding corridors 
and up and down ramps that 
twisted and turned to lead into 
other ramps and corridors. That 
was the way all public buildings 
were designed. It was forbidden 
for the government to make any 
law-abiding individual think the 
way it wanted him to think. But 
it could move him in any direc- 
tion it chose, and sometimes that 
served its purpose as well as the 
reorientation machines. 

So the corridors he passed 
through were in constant eddy- 
ing movement, with a variety of 
individuals bent on a variety of 
objectives. For the most part, 
they were of Low Echelon status, 
though occasionally an Upper 
Echelon flashed his peremptory 
way past. Even though most 
L-Es attempted to ape the U-E 
dress and manner, you could al- 
ways tell the difference. You 
could tell the difference among 
the different levels of L-E, too — 



and there was no mistaking the 
Unemployables in their sober 
gray habits, devoid of ornament. 
It was, Clarey sometimes 
thought when guilt feelings 
bothered him, the most esthetic 
of costumes. 

^ I ’’HE machine in Room 33 ex- 
tracted whatever information 
it was set to receive, then spewed 
Clarey out and sent him on his 
way to Rooms 34, 35, and 36, 
where other machines repeated 
the same process. Room 37 
proved to be that rare thing in 
the hierarchy of rooms — a des- 
tination. There was a human 
Employment Commissioner in 
it, splendidly garbed in crimson 
silvet and alexandrites — very 
Upper Echelon, indeed. He 
wore a gold mask, a common 
practice with celebrities who 
were afraid of being over- 
whelmed by -their admirers, an 
even more common practice 
with U-E non-celebrities who en- 
joyed the thrill of distinguished 
anonymity. 

Then Clarey stopped looking 
at the Commissioner. There was 
a girl sitting next to him, on a 
high-backed chair like his. 
Clarey had never seen a U-E 
girl so close before. Only the 
Greater Archivists had direct 
contact with the public, and 
Clarey wasn’t likely to meet a 
U-E socially, even if he’d had a 



8 



GALAXY 



social life. The girl was too fabu- 
lous for him to think of her as 
a woman, a female; but he would 
have liked to _ have her in his 
archives, in the glass case with 
the rare editions. 

“Good morning, Sub-Archivist 
Clarey,” the man said mellowly. 
“Good of you to come in. There’s 
rather an unusual position open 
and the machines tell us you’re 
the one man who can fill it. 
Please sit down.” He indicated a 
small, hard stool. 

Clarey remained standing. 
“I’ve been a perfectly competent 
Sub-Archivist,” he declared. “If 
MacFingal has — if there have 
been any complaints, I should 
have been told first.” 

“There have been no com- 
plaints. The reclassification is 
upward.” 

“You mean I’ve made it as 
a Musician!” Clarey cried, sink- 
ing to the hard little stool in 
joyful atony. 

“Well, no, not exactly a Musi- 
cian. But it’s a highly artistic 
type of job with possible musical 
overtones.” 

Clarey became a hollow man 
once more. No matter what it 
was, if it wasn’t as duly accred- 
ited Musician, it didn’t matter. 
The machine could keep him 
from putting his symphonies 
down on tape, but it couldn’t 
keep them from coursing in his 
head. That it could never take 



away from him. Or the resultant 
headache, either. 

“What is the job, then?” he 
asked dully. 

“A very important position, 
Sub-Archivist. In fact, the future 
welfare of this planet may de- 
pend on it.” 

“It’s a trick to make me take 
a job nobody else wants,” Clarey 
sneered. “And it must be a pretty 
rotten job for you to go to so 
much trouble.” 

The girl, whom he’d almost 
forgotten, gave a little laugh. Her 
eyes, he noticed, were hazel. 
There were L-E girls, he sup- 
posed, who also had hazel eyes 
— but a different hazel. 

4;i>ERHAPS this will con- 
vince you of the job’s sig- 
nificance,” the interviewer said 
huffily. He took off his mask and 
looked at Clarey with anticipa- 
tion. He had a sleek, ordinary, 
middle-aged-to-elderly face. 

There was an awkward inter- 
val. “Don’t you recognize me?” 
he demanded. 

Clarey shook his head. The 
girl laughed again. 

“A blow to my ego, but proof 
that you’re the right man for 
this job.^’m General Spano. And 
this is my Mistress, Secretary 
Han Vollard.” 

The girl inclined her head. 

“At least you must know my 
name?” Spano said querulously. 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



9 



“I’ve heard it,” Clarey admit- 
ted. “ “The Fiend of Fomalhaut,’ 
they call you,” he went on before 
he could catch himself and stop 
the words. 

The girl clapped her hand 
over her mouth, but the laughter 
spilled out over and around it, 
pretty U-E laughter. 

Spano finally laughed, too. 
“It’s a phrase that might be used 
about any military man. One 
carries out one’s orders to the 
best of one’s ability.” 

“Besides,” Clarey observed in 
a non-Archivistic manner, “what 
concern have I with your mili- 
tary morality?” 

“He’s absolutely perfect for 
the job, Steff!” she cried. “I 
didn’t think the machines were 
that good!” 

“We mustn’t underestimate 
the machines, Han,” Spano said. 
“They’re efficient, very efficient. 
Someday they’ll take over from 
us.” 

“There’re some things they’ll 
never be able to do,” she said. 
Her hazel eyes lingered on 
Clarey’s. “Aren’t you glad, Archi- 
vist?” 

“Sub-Archivist,” he corrected 
her frostily. “And I hadn’t really 
thought about it.” 

“That’s not what the machines 
say, Sub-Archivist,” she told 
him, her voice candy-sweet. 
“They deep-probed your mind. 
You don’t do anything, but 



you’ve thought about it a lot, 
haven’t you?” 

Clarey felt the blood surge 
up. “My thoughts are my own 
concern. You haven’t the right 
to use them to taunt me.” 

“But I think you’re attractive,” 
she protested. “Honestly I do. In 
a different way. Just go to a good 
tailor, put on a little weight, dye 
your hair, and — ” 

“And I wouldn’t be different 
any more,” Clarey finished. That 
wasn’t true; he would always be 
different. Not that he was de- 
formed, just unappealing. He 
was below average height and 
his eyes and hair and skin were 
too light. In the past, he knew, 
there had been pale races and 
dark races on Earth. With the 
discovery of other intelligent 
life-forms to discriminate against 
together, the different races had 
fused into a swarthy unity. Of 
course he could hide his etiola- 
tion with dye and cosmetics, but 
those of really good quality cost 
more than he could afford, and 
cheap maquillage was worse 
than none. Besides, why should 
his appearance mean anything 
to anybody but himself? He’d 
had enough beating around the 
bush! “Would you mind telling 
me exactly what the job is?” 

“Intelligence agent,” said 
Spano. 

“Isn’t it exciting?” she put in. 
“Aren’t you thrilled?” 



10 



GALAXY 



^LAREY bounced angrily 
^ from his chair. “I won’t sit 
here and be ridiculed!” 

“Why ridiculed?” Spano 
asked. “Don’t you consider your- 
self an intelligent man?” 

“Being an intelligence, agent 
has nothing to do with intelli- 
gence!” Clarey said furiously. 
“The whole thing’s silly, straight 
out of the tri-dis.” 

“What do you have against 
the tri-dis. Sub- Archivist?” 

Spano’s voice was very quiet. 

“Don’t you like any of them?” 
the girl said. “I just adore Sen- 
tries of the Sky!” Her enthusiasm 
was tinged, obscurely, with warn- 
ing. 

‘Well, I enjoy it, too,” Clarey 
said, sinking back to the stool. 
“It’s very entertaining, but I’m 
sure it isn’t meant to be taken 
seriously.” 

“Oh, but it is, Sub-Archivist 
Clarey,” Spano said. “Sentries of 
the Sky happens to be produced 
by my bureau. We want the pub- 
lic to know all about our opera- 
tions — or as much as it’s good 
for them to know — and they 
find it more palatable in fiction- 
alized form.” 

“Documentaries always get 
low ratings,” the girl said. “And 
you can’t really blame the pub- 
lic — documentaries are dull. 
Myself, I like a love interest.” 
Her eyes rested lingeringly on 
Clarey’s. 



They must think I’m a fool, 
Clarey thought; yet why would 
they bother to fool me? “But I 
am given to understand,” he said 
to Spano, “even by the tri-dis, 
that an intelligence agent needs 
special training, special qualifi- 
cations.” 

“In this case, the special qual- 
ifications outweigh the training. 
And you have the qualifications 
we need for Damorlan.” 

“According to the machines, 
all I’m qualified for is human 
filing cabinet. Is that what you 
want?” 

Spano was growing impatient. 
“Look, Clarey, the machines 
have decided that you are not a 
Musician. Do you want to re- 
main a Sub-Archivist for the rest 
of your days or will you take 
this other road? Once you’re on 
a U-E level, you can fight the 
machines; tape your own music 
if you like.” 

Clarey said nothing, but his 
initial hostility was ebbing slow- 
ly away. 

“I wanted to be a writer,” 
Spano said. “The machines said 
no. So I became a soldier, rose 
to the top. Now — this is in 
strictest confidence — I write 
most of the episodes of Sentries 
of the Sky myself. There’s al- 
ways another route for the man 
with guts and vision, and, above 
all, faith. Why don’t we continue 
the discussion over lunch?” 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



11 



TT was almost unthinkable for 

L-E and U-E to eat together. 
For Clarey this was an honor — 
too great an honor — and there 
was no way out of it. Spano and 
the girl put on their masks; the 
general touched a section of the 
wall and it slid back. There was 
a car waiting for them outside. 
It skimmed over the delicately 
wrought, immensely strong 
bridges that, together with the 
tunnels, linked the great glitter- 
ing metropolis into a vast effi- 
cient whole. 

Spano was not really broad- 
minded. Although they went 
to the Aurora Borealis, it was 
through a side door, and they 
were served in a private dining 
room. Clarey was glad and 
nettled at th^e same time. 

The first few mouthfuls of the 
food tasted ambrosial; then it 
cloyed and Clarey had to force 
it down with a thin, almost as- 
tringent pale blue liquid. In it- 
self, the liquor had only a mild, 
slightly pungent taste, but it 
made everything else increasing- 
ly delightful — the warm, lux- 
urious little room, the perfume 
that wafted from the air-condi- 
tioning ducts, Han Vollard. 

“Martian mountain wine,” she 
warned him. “Rather overwhelm- 
ing if you’re not used to it, and 
sometimes even if you are . .” 
Her eyes rested on the general. 

“But there are no mountains 



on Mars,” Clarey said, startled. 

“That’s it!” Spano chortled. 
“When you’ve drunk it, you see 
mountains!” And he filled his 
glass again. 

While they ate, he told Clarey 
about Damorlan — its beautiful 
climate, light gravity, intelligent 
and civilized natives. Though 
the planet had been known for 
two decades, no one from Earth 
had ever been there except a 
few selected government offi- 
cials, and, of course, the regular 
staff posted there. 

“You mean it hasn’t been 
colonized yet?” Clarey was re- 
lieved, because he felt he should, 
as an Archivist, have known 
more about the planet than its 
name and coordinates. “Why? It 
sounds like a splendid place for 
a colony.” 

“The natives,” Spano said. 

“There were natives on a lot 
of the planets we colonized. You 
disposed of them somehow.” 

“By co-existence in most cases, 
Sub-Archivist,” Spano said drily. 
“We’ve found it best for Terrans 
and natives to live side by side 
in harmony. We dispose of a 
race only when it’s necessary for 
the greatest good. And we would 
especially dislike having to dis- 
pose of the Damorlanti.” 

“What’s wrong with them?” 
Clarey asked, pushing away his 
half-finished creme brulee a la 
Betelgeuse with a sigh. “Are they 



12 



GALAXY 



excessively belligerent, then?” 
“No more belligerent than any 
intelligent life-form which has 
pulled itself up by its boot- 
straps.” 

“Rigid?” Clarey suggested. 
“Unadaptable? Intolerant? In- 
dolent? Personally offensive?” 

OPANO smiled. He leaned 
^ back with half-shut eyes, as 
if this were a guessing game. 
“None of those.” 

“Then why consider disposing 
of them?” Clarey asked. “They 
sound pretty decent for natives. 
Don’t wipe them out; even an ilf 
has a right to live.” 

“Clarey,” the girl said, “you’re 
drunk.” 

“I’m in full command of my 
faculties,” he assured her. “My 
wits are all about me, moving 
me to ask how you could pos- 
sibly expect to use a secret agent 
on Damorlan if there are no 
colonists. What would he dis- 
guise himself as — a touring 
Earth official?” He laughed with 
modest triumph. 

Spano smiled. “He could dis- 
guise himself as one of them. 
They’re humanoid.” 

“That humanoid?” 

“That humanoid. So there you 
have the problem in a nutshell.” 
But Clarey still couldn’t see 
that there was a problem. “I 
thought we — the human race, 
that is — were supposed to be 



the very apotheosis of life 
species.” 

“So we are. And that’s the im- 
pression we’ve conveyed to such 
other intelligent life-forms as 
we’ve taken under our aegis. 
What we’re afraid of is that the 
other ilfs might become . con- 
fused when they see the Damor- 
lanti, think they’re the ruling 
race.” Leaning forward, he 
pounded so loudly on the table 
both the others jumped. “This is 
our galaxy and we don’t intend 
that anyone, humanoid or other- 
wise, is going to forget it!” 

“You’re drunk, too, Steff,” the 
girl said. She had changed com- 
pletely; her coquetry had drop- 
ped as if it were another mask. 
And it had been, Clarey thought 
— an advertising mask. An offer 
had been made, and, if he ac- 
cepted it, he would get probably 
not Han herself but a reasonable 
facsimile. 

He tried to sort things out in 
his whizzing brain. “But why 
should the other ilfs ever see a 
Damorlant?” he asked, enunciat- 
ing very precisely. “I’ve never 
seen another life-form to speak 
of. I thought the others weren’t 
allowed off-planet — except the 
Baluts, and there’s no mistaking 
them, is there?” For the Baluts, 
although charming, were unmis- 
takably non-human, being pur- 
plish, amiable, and octopoid. 

“We don’t forbid the ilfs to go 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



13 



off-planet,” Spano proclaimed. 
“That would be tyrannical. We 
simply don’t allow them passage 
in our spaceships. Since they 
don’t have any of their own, they 
can’t leave.” 

“Then you’re afraid the Dam- 
orlanti will develop space travel 
on their own,” Clarey cried. 
“Superior race — seeking after 
knowledge — spread their wings 
and soar to the stars.” He flapped 
his arms and fell off the stool. 

“Really, Steff,” Han said, mo- 
tioning for the servo-mechanism 
to pick Clarey up, “this is no way 
to conduct an interview.” 

“I am a creative artist,” the 
general said thickly. “I believe 
in suiting the interview to the 
occasion. Clarey understands, for 
he, too, is an artist.” The general 
sneezed and rubbed his nose 
with his silver sleeve. “Listen to 
me, boy. The Damorlanti are a 
fine, creative, productive race. It 
isn’t generally known, but they 
developed the op fastener for 
evening wear, two of the new 
scents on the roster come from 
Damorlan, and the snettis is an 
adaptation of a Damorlant orig- 
inal. Would you want a species 
as artistic as that to be annihi- 
lated by an epidemic?” 

“Do our germs work on 
them?” Clarey wanted to know. 

“That hasn’t been established 
yet. But .their germs certainly 
work on us.” The general sneezed 



again. “That’s where I got this 
sinus trouble, last voyage to 
Damorlan. But you’ll be inocu- 
lated, of course. Now we know 
what to watch out for, so you’ll 
be perfectly safe. That is, as far 
as disease is concerned.” 

T1~IS FACE assumed a stern, 
noble aspect. “Naturally, if 
you’re discovered as a spy, we’ll 
have to repudiate you. You must 
know that from the tri-dis.” 

“But I haven’t said I would 
go!” Clarey howled. “And I can’t 
see why you’d want me, anyway!” 
“Modest,” the general said, 
lighting a smoke-stick. “An ad- 
mirable trait in a young intelli- 
gence operatii^e — or, indeed, 
anyone. Have a smoke-stick?” 
Clarey hesitated. He had 
never tried one; he had always 
wanted to. 

“Don’t, Clarey,” the girl ad- 
vised. “You’ll be sick.” 

She spoke with authority and 
reason. Clarey shook his head. 

The general inhaled and ex- 
haled a cloud of smoke in the 
' shape of a bunnit. “The Damor- 
lanti look like us, but because 
they look like us, that doesn’t 
mean they think like us. They 
may not have the least idea of 
developing space travel, simply 
be interested in developing 
thought, art, ideals, splendid 
cultural things like that. We 
don’t know enough about them;

we may be making mountains 
out of molehills.” 

“Martian molehills,” Clarey 
snickered. 

“Precisely,” the general agreed. 
“Except that there are no moles 
on Mars either.” 

“But I still can’t understand. 
Why me?” 

The general leaned forward 
and said in a confidential tone, 
“We want to understand the true 
Damorlan. Our observations 
have been too superficial; 
couldn’t help being. There we 
come, blasting out of the skies 
with the devil of a noise, running 
all over the planet as if we owned 
it. You know how those skyboys 
throw their gravity around.” 

Clarey nodded. Sentries of the 
Sky had kept him well informed 
on such matters. 

“So what we want is a man 
who can go to Damorlan for five 
or ten years and become a Dam- 
orlant in everything but basic 
loyalties. A man who will absorb 
the very spirit of the culture, but 
in terms our machines can under- 
stand and interpret.” Spano stood 
erect. “You, Clarey, are that 
man!” 

The girl applauded. “Well 
done, Steff! You finally got it 
right side up!” 

“But I’ve lived twenty-eight 
years on this planet and I’m not 
a part of its culture,” Clarey pro- 
tested. “I’m a lonely, friendless 



man — you must know that if 
you’ve deep-probed me — so 
why should I put up a front and 
be brave and proud about it?” 

^ I ■'HEN HE gave a short, bitter 
laugh. “I see. That’s the rea- 
son you want me. I have no roots, 
no ties; I belong nowhere. No- 
body loves me. Who else, you 
think, but a man like me would 
spend ten years on an alien 
planet as an alien?” 

“A patriot, Sub-Archivist,” the 
general said sternly. “By God, 
sir, a patriot!” 

“There’s nothing I’d like better 
than to see Terra and all its 
colonies go up in smoke. Mind 
you,” Clarey added quickly, for 
he was not as drunk as all that, 
“I’ve nothing against the govern- 
ment. It’s a purely personal 
grievance.” 

The general unsteadily patted 
his arm. “You’re detached, m’boy. 
You can examine an alien planet 
objectively, without trying to 
project your own cultural iden- 
tity upon it, because you have no 
cultural identity.” 

“How about physical iden- 
tity?” Clarey asked. “They can’t 
be ex-exactly like us. Against 
the laws of nature.” 

“The laws of man are higher 
than the laws of nature,” the 
general said, waving his arm. A 
gout of smoke curled around his 
head and became a hdlo. “Very

slight matter of plastic surgery. 
And we’ll change you back as 
soon as you return.” Then he sat 
down heavily. “How many young 
men in your position get an op- 
portunity like this? Permanent 
U-E status, a hundred thousand 
credits a year and, of course, on 
Damorlan you’d be on an ex- 
pense account; our money’s no 
good there. By the time you got 
back, there’d be about a million 
and a half waiting for you, with 
interest. You could buy all the 
instruments and tape all the 
music you wanted. And, if the 
Musicians’ Guild puts up a fuss, 
you could buy it, too. Don’t let 
anybody kid you about the 
wheel, son; money was man- 
kind’s first significant invention.” 
“But ten years. That’s a long 
time away from home.” 

“Home is where the heart is, 
and you wanting to see your own 
planet go up in a puff of smoke 

— why, even an ilf wouldn’t say 
a thing like that!” Spano shook 
his head. “That’s too detached for 
me to understand. You’ll find the 
years will pass quickly on Dam- 
orlan. You’ll have stimulating 
work to do; every moment will 
be a challenge. When it’s all 
over, you’ll be only thirty -eight 

— the very prime of life. You 
won’t have aged even that much, 
because you’ll be entitled to 
longevity treatments at regular 
intervals. 



“So think it over, m’boy.” He 
rose waveringly and clapped 
Clarey on the shoulder. “And 
take the rest of the afternoon off; 
I’ll fix it with Archives. We 
wouldn’t want you coming back 
from Classification intoxicated.” 
He winked. “Make a very bad 
impression on your co-workers.” 

Han masked herself and es- 
corted Clarey to the restaurant 
portway. “Don’t believe every- 
thing he says. But I think you’d 
better accept the offer.” 

“I don’t have to,” Clarey said. 

“No,” she agreed, “you don’t. 
But you’d better.” 

^LAREY TOOK the cheap 
^ underground route home. His 
antiseptic little two-room apart- 
ment seemed even bleaker than 
usual. He dialed a dyspep pill 
from the auto-spensor; the lunch 
was beginning to tell on him. 
And that evening he couldn’t 
even talce an interest in Sentries 
of the Sky, which, though he’d 
never have admitted it, was his 
favorite program. He had no 
friends; nobody would miss him 
if he left Earth or died or any- 
thing. The general’s right, he 
thought; I might as well be an 
alien on an alien planet. At least ; 
I’ll be paid better. And he won- 
dered whether, in lighter gravity, 
his spirits might not get a lift. 

He dragged himself to work 
the next day. He found someone 



16 



GALAXY 



did care after all. ‘Well, Sub- 
Archivist Clarey,” Chief Section 
Archivist MacFingal snarled, “I 
would have expected to see more 
sparkle in your eye, more pep in 
your step, after a whole day of 
nothing but sweet rest.” 

“But — but General Spano 
said it would be all right if I 
didn’t report back in the after- 
noon.” 

“Oh, it is all right, Sub- 
Archivist, no question of that. 
How could I dare to complain 
about a man who has such 
powerful friends? I suppose if I 
gave you the Sagittarius files to 
reorganize, you’d go running to 
your friend General Spano, sniv- 
eling about cruel and unfair 
treatment.” 

So Clarey started reorganizing 
the Sagittarius files — a sicken- 
ingly dull task which should by 
rights have gone to a junior 
archivist. All morning he couldn’t 
help thinking about Damorlan — 
its invigorating atmosphere, its 
pleasant climate, its presumed 
absence of archives and archiv- 
ists. During his lunchstop he 
looked up the planet in the files. 
There was only a small part of a 
tape on it. There might be more 
in the Classified Files. It was, of 
course, forbidden to view se- 
cretapes without a direct order 
from the Chief Archivist, but the 
tapes were locked by the same 
code as the rare editions. After 

SENTRY OF THE SKY 



all, he told himself, I have a 
legitimate need for the informa- 
tion. 

So he punched for Damorlan 
in the secret files. He put the 
tape in the viewer. He saw the 
natives. Cold shock filled him, 
and then hot fury. They were 
humanoid all right — pallid, 
pale-haired creatures. Objective 
viewpoint, he thought furiously; 
detachment be damned! I was 
picked because I look like one of 
them! 

He was wrenched away from 
the viewer. “Sub-Archivist 
Clarey, what is the meaning of 
this?” Chief Section Archivist 
MacFingal demanded. “You 
know what taking a secretape 
out without permission means?” 

Clarey knew. The reorienta- 
tion machine. “Ask General 
Spano,” he said in a constricted 
voice. “He’ll tell you it’s all right.” 

/GENERAL Spano said that it 
^^was, indeed, all right. “I’m so 
glad to hear you’ve decided to 
join us. Splendid career for an 
enterprising young man. Smoke- 
stick?” 

Clarey refused; he no longer 
had any interest in trying one. 

“Don’t look so grim,” Spano 
said jovially. “You’ll like the 
Damorlanti once you get to 
know them. Very affectionate 
people. Haven’t had any major 
wars for several generations. Cur- 



17 



rently there are just a few 
skirmishes at the poles and you 
ought to be able to keep away 
from those easily. And they’ll 
simply love you.” 

“But I don’t like anyone,” 
Clarey said. “And I don’t see why 
the Damorlanti should like me,” 
he added fairly. 

“I’ll tell you why! Because it’ll 
be your job to make them like 
you. You’ve got to be friendly 
and outgoing if it kills you. Any- 
one can develop a winning per- 
sonality if he sets his mind to it. 
I though you said you watched 
the tri-dis!” 

“I — I don’t always watch the 
commercials,” Clarey admitted. 

“Oh, well, we all have our little 
failings.” Spano leaned forward, 
his voice now pitched to per- 
suasive decibels. “Normally, of 
course,, you wouldn’t stoop to 
hypocrisy to gain friends, and 
quite right, too — people should 
accept you as you are or they 
wouldn’t be worthy of becoming 
your friends. But this is different. 
You have to be what they want, 
because you want something 
from them. You’ll have to suffer 
rebuffs and humiliations and 
never show resentment.” 

“In other words,” Clarey said, 
“a secret agent is supposed to 
forget all about such concepts as 
self-respect.” 

“If necessary, yes. But here 
self-respect doesn’t enter into it. 



These aren’t people and they 
don’t, really matter. You wouldn’t 
be humiliated, would you, if you 
tried to pat a dog and it snarled 
at you?” 

“Steff, he’s got to think of 
them as people until he’s defin- 
itely given them a clean bill of 
health,” Han Vollard protested. 
“Otherwise, the whole thing 
won’t work.” 

“Well,” the general temporized, 
“think of them as people, then, 
but as inferior people. Let them 
snoop and pry and sneer. Always, 
at the back of your mind, you’ll 
have the knowledge that this is 
all a sham, that someday they’ll 
get whatever it is they deserve. 
You might even think of it as a 
game, Clarey — no more per- 
sonal than when you fail to get 
the gardip ball into the loop.” 

“I don’t happen to play gardip. 
General,” Clarey reminded him 
coldly. Gardip was strictly a U-E 
pastime. And, in any case, Clarey 
was not a gamesman. 

He was put through intensive 
indoctrination, given accelerated 
courses in the total secret agent 
curriculum: Self-Defense and 

Electronics, Decoding and Re- 
sourcefulness, Xenopsychology 
and Acting. 

“There are eight cardinal rules 
of acting,” the robocoach told 
him. “The first is: Never Identify. 
You’ll never be able to become 
the character you’re playing, be- 



18 



GALAXY 



cause you aren’t that character 
— the playwright gave birth to 
him, not your mother. There- 
fore — ” 

“But I’m only going to play 
one role,” Clarey broke in. “All I 
need to know is how to play that 
role well and convincingly. My 
life may depend on it.” 

“I teach acting,” the robo- 
coach said loftily. “I don’t run a 
charm school. If you come to me, 
you learn — or, at least, are ex- 
posed to — all I have to offer. I 
refuse to tailor my art to any 
occasional need. Now, the second 
cardinal rule ...” 

^LAREY was glad he could 
^ absorb the languages and 
social structure of the planet 
through the impersonal hypno- 
tapes. He had to learn more than 
one language because the planet 
was divided into several national 
units, each speaking a different 
tongue. Inefficient as far as 
planetary operation went, but 
advantageous to him, Han Vol- 
lard pointed out, because, though 
he’d work in Vangtor, he would 
be supposed to have originated 
in Ventimor; hence his accent. 

“Work?” Clarey asked. “I 
thought I was going to be an 
undercover agent.” 

“You’ll have a cover job,” she 
explained wearily. “You can’t 
just wander around with no 
visible source of income, unless 



you’re a member of the nobility, 
and it would be risky to elevate 
you to the peerage.” 

“What kind of a job will I 
have?” Clarey asked, brightening 
a little at the idea of possibly 
having something interesting to 
do. 

“They call it librarian. I’m 
not exactly sure what it is, but 
Colonel Blynn — he’s our chief 
officer on the planet — says that 
after indoctrination you ought to 
be able to handle it.” 

Clarey already knew that jobs 
on Damorlan weren’t officially 
assigned, but that employer and 
employee somehow managed to 
find each other and work out 
arrangements themselves. Some- 
times, Han now explained, em- 
ployers would advertise for 
employees. Colonel Blynn had 
answered such a job in Vangtor 
on his behalf from an accommo- 
dation address in Ventimor. 
“You were hired sight unseen, 
because you came cheap. So they 
probably won’t check your ref- 
erences. Let’s hope not, anyway.” 

^1 ^HE TRIP to Damorlan was 
one long aching agony. Since 
luxury liners naturally didn’t 
touch on Damorlan, he was sent 
out on a service freighter, built 
for maximum stowage rather 
than comfort. Most of the time 
he was spacesick. The only thing 
that comforted him was that it 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



19 



would be ten years before he’d 
have to go back. 

They landed on the Earth- 
men’s spaceport — the only 
spaceport, of course — at Bar- 
shwat, and he was hustled off to 
Earth Headquarters in an ani- 
mal-drawn cart that made him 
realize there were other ailments 
besides spacesickness. 

“Afraid you’re going to have to 
hole up in my suite while you’re 
with us,” Colonel Blynn apolo- 
gized when Clarey was safely 
inside. “The rest of the establish- 
ment is crawling with native 
servants — daytimes, anyway; 
they sleep out — but they have 
orders never to come near my 
quarters.” 

He looked interestedly at 
Clarey. “Amazing how the plasto- 
surgeons got you to look exactly 
like a native. Those boys really 
know their stuff. Maybe I will 
have my nose fixed next time I 
go Earthside.” 

Clarey glared venomously at 
the tall, handsome, dark young 
officer. 

“Don’t worry,” Blynn soothed 
him. “I’m sure when you go back 
they’ll be able to make you look 
exactly the way you were before.” 

He gave Clarey a general 
briefing and explained to him 
that the additional allowance 
he’d be receiving — since he 
couldn’t be expected to live on a 
Damorlant salary — would 



come from an alleged rich aunt 
in Barshwat. 

“Where’ll you get the native 
currency?” Clarey asked. 

“We do some restricted trad- 
ing with the natives, bring 
materials that’re in short supply; 
salt, breakfast cereals, pigments, 
thread — stuff like that. Nothing 
strategic, nothing they could 
possibly use against us . unless 
they decide to strangle us with 
our own string.” He guffawed ear- 
splittingly. 

/^NE RAINY evening a couple 
of Earth officers hustled 
Clarey into a hax-cart. A little 
later, equipped with a native kit, 
an itinerary, and a ticket pur- 
chased in Ventimor, he was left 
a short distance from a large 
track-car station. 

He was so numb with fright 
he had to force himself to move 
in the right direction leg by leg. 
He gained a little confidence 
when he was able to find the 
terminus without needing to ask 
directions; he even managed to 
find the right chain of cars and 
a place to sit in one of them. He 
didn’t realize that this was some- 
thing of an achievement until he 
discovered that certain later 
arrivals had to stand. He won- 
dered why more tickets were 
issued than there were seats 
available, then realized the 
answer was simple — primitives 



20 



GALAXY 



couldn’t count very accurately. 

Creakily and slowly, the chain 
got imder way. Clarey’s terror 
mounted. Here he was, wearing 
strange clothes, on a strange 
world, surroxmded by strange 
creatures. They aren’t really re- 
pulsive, he told himself; they 



look like people; they look like 
me. 

Some of the natives seemed to 
be staring at him. His heart 
began to beat loudly. Could they 
hear it? Did their hearts beat 
the same way? Was their hearing 
more acute than his? The tapes 





had seemed so full of informa- 
tion; now he saw how full of 
holes they’d been. Then he no- 
ticed that the natives were star- 
ing at each other. His heart 
quieted. Only a local custom. 
After a while, little conversa- 
tional groups formed. No one 
spoke to him, for he spoke to no 
one. He was not yet ready to 
thrust himself upon them; he 
had enough to do to reach his 
destination successfully. 

He tried to follow the con- 
versations for practice and to 
keep his mind off his fears. The 
male next to him was talking to 
the male opposite about the 
weather and its effect on the 
sirtles. The three females on his 
other side were telling each other 
how their respective offspring 
were doing in school. Some 
voices he couldn’t identify with 
owners were complaining how 
much sagor and titulwirt cost 
these days. I don’t know why the 
government is so worried, he 
thought; they’re not really very 
human at all. 

The chain had been scheduled 
to reach the end of its run in 
three hours. It took closer to 
five. He got off at what would 
have been around midnight on 
Earth, and the terminus where he 
was supposed to take the next 
chain was almost empty of peo- 
ple, completely empty of cars. 
Although it was still a few min- 



utes before his car was due, he 
was worried. Finally, he ap- 
proached a native. 

“Is this — is this not where 
the 39:12 to Zrig is destined to 
appear?” he asked, conscious as 
he uttered Vangtort aloud for the 
first time that his phrasing was 
not entirely colloquial. 

The native stared at him with 
small pale eyes and bit his mid- 
dle finger. “Stranger, eh?” he 
asked in a small pale voice. 

“Yes.” The native waited. “I 
come from Ventimor,” Clarey 
told him. Nosy native, he thought 
furiously; prying primitive. 

“You don’t hafta shout,” the 
native said. “I’m not deef.” 

Clarey realized what he hadn’t 
noted consciously before — the 
natives spoke much more softly 
than Earthmen. Local custom 
two. 

“You’ll be finding things a lot 
different here in Vangtor,” the 
native told him. “Livelier, more 
up to date. F’rinstance, do the 
cars always run on time in Ven- 
timor?” 

“Yes,” Clarey said firmly. 

“Well, they don’t here. Know 
why? That’s because we’ve got 
more’n one chain of ’em.” He 
made a noise like a wounded 
turshi. He was laughing. 

^LAREY smiled until his gums 
^ ached. “About the 39:12? 
It is rather important to me, as 



22 



GALAXY 



I understand the next chain does 
not leave for several days.” 

The native lifted a chrono- 
meter hanging around his neck. 
“Ought to get in around 40 or so,” 
he said. “Whyn’t you get yourself 
a female or a bite to eat?” He 
waved his hand toward the two 
trade booths that were still open 
for business. 

Clarey was very hungry. But, 
as he got near the food booth, the 
stench and the sight of the uten- 
sils were too much for him. He 
went back to the carways and 
sat huddled on a banquette until 
his chain came in at 40:91. 

The car he picked was empty, 
so he stretched out on the seat 
and slept until it got to Zrig, very 
early in the morning. When he 
got out, day was dawning and a 
food booth hadn’t had time to ac- 
cumulate odors so he climbed to 
one of the perches and pointed 
to something that looked like a 
lopsided pie and something else 
that looked like coffee. Neither 
was what it appeared to be, but 
the pseudo-pie was edible and 
the pseudo-coffee was good. 
Somehow, the food seemed to 
diminish his fright; it made the 
world less strange. 

“Where you going, stranger?” 
the native asked, resting his arms 
on the top of the booth. 

“Katund,” Clarey said. The 
other looked puzzled. “It is a vil- 
lage near Zrig.” 



“That a fact?” The native bit 
his little finger. “You look like a 
city feller to me.” 

“That is correct,” Clarey said 
patiently. “I come from Qytet. It 
is a place of some size.” He 
waited a decent interval before 
collapsing his smile. 

“Now, why would a smart- 
looking young fellow like you 
want to go to a place like this 
Katund, eh?” 

Clarey started to shrug, then 
remembered that was not a Da- 
morlant gesture. “I have received 
employment there.” 

“I should think you’d be able 
to do better’n that.” The native 
nibbled at his thumb. “What did 
you say you worked at?” 

“I didn’t. I am a librarian.” 
The native turned away and 
began to rinse his utensils. “In 
that case, I guess Katund’s as 
good a place as any.” 

Surely, Clarey thought, even 
a Damorlant would at this point 
rise up and smite the food mer- 
chant with one of his own plat- 
ters. Then he forgot his anger 
in apprehension. What in the 
name of whatever gods they wor- 
shipped on this planet could a 
librarian possibly be? 

He got up and was about to 
go. Then he remembered to be 
friendly and outgoing. “I have 
never tasted better food,” he told 
the native. “Not even in Bar- 
shwat.” 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



23 






The native picked up the coin 
Clarey had left by way of tip 
and bit it. Apparently it passed 
the test. “Stop here next time 
you’re passing this way,” he ad- 
vised, “and I’ll really serve you 
something to write home about!” 

'T'HE OMNIBUS for Katund 
proved to be nothing but a 
large cart drawn by a team of 
hax. Clarey waited for internal 
manifestations as he rode. None 
came. I’ve found my land legs, he 
thought, or, rather, my land stom- 
ach. And with the hax jogging 
along the quiet lanes of Vangtor, 
he found himself almost at peace. 

Earth was completely urban- 
ized: there were the great metro- 
polises; there were the parks; 
there were the oceans. That was 
all. So to him the Vangtort coun- 
tryside looked like a huge park, 
with grass and trees and flowers 
that were slightly unrealistic in 
color, but beautiful just the same 
— even more, perhaps. It was 
idyllic. There’s bound to be some 
catch, he thought. 

The other passengers, who’d 
been talking together in low 
tones, turned toward Clarey. 
“You’ll be the new librarian, I 
take it?” the tallest observed. He 
was a bulky creature, wearing a 
rich but sober cloak that came 
down to his ankles. 

For a moment Clarey couldn’t 
understand him; the local dia- 



lect seemed to thicken the words. 
“Why, yes. How did you know 
that?” 

The native wiggled his ears. 
“Not many folks come to Katund 
and a new librarian’s expected, 
so it wasn’t hard to figure. Ex- 
cept you don’t look my idea of a 
librarian.” 

Clarey nervously smoothed 
the dark red cloak that covered 
him from shoulder to mid-calf. 
Was it too loud? Too quiet? Too 
short? 

“What give you the idea of 
cornin’ to Katund?” the oldest 
and smallest of the three asked 
in a whistling voice. “It’s no place 
anybody who wasn’t born here’d 
choose.” 

“Most young fellers favor the 
city,” the third — a barrel-shaped 
individual — agreed. “I’d of gone 
there myself when I was a lad, if 
Dad hadn’t needed somebody to 
take over the Purple Furbush 
when he was gone.” 

“Maybe he’s runnin’ away,” the 
ancient sibilated. “When I was a 
boy, there was a feller from the 
city came here; turned out to be 
a thief.” All three stared at 
Clarey. 

“I — I replied to an advertise- 
ment in the Dordolec District 
Bulletin,” he said carefully. “I 
wished for a position that was 
peaceful and quiet. I am recover- 
ing from an overset of the ner- 
vous system.” 



24 



GALAXY 



The oldest one said, “That’d 
account for it right enough.” 

Clarey gritted his teeth and 
beamed at them. 

“Typical idiot smile,” the an- 
cient whispered. “Noticed it my- 
self right off, but I didn’t like to 
say.” 

“Is it right to have a librarian 
that isn’t all there?” the proprie- 
tor of the Furbush asked. “For- 
eigner, too. I mean to say — the 
young ones use him more’n most.” 

“We’ve got to take what we 
can get,” the biggest native said. 
“Katund’s funds are running 
mighty low.” 

“What can you expect when 
you ballot yourself a salary raise 
every year?” the old one whis- 
tled. The other two made animal 
noises. Clarey must not jump; he 
must learn to laugh like a turshi 
if he hoped to be the life of any 
Damorlant party. 

HE BIG ONE stood up as 
well as he could in the sway- 
ing cart. “Guess I’d better 
interduce myself,” he said, hold- 
ing out a sturdily shod foot. “I’m 
Malesor, headman of Katund. 
This is Piq; he deals in blots and 
snarls. And Hanxi here’s the inn- 
keeper.” 

“My name is Balt,” Clarey said. 
“I am honored by this meeting.” 
And he went through the con- 
ventional toe-touching with each 
one. 



“Guess you’ll be putting up 
with me imtil you’ve found 
permanent quarters, Til Balt,” 
Hanxi said. “Not that you could 
do much better than make your 
permanent home at the Purple 
Furbush. You’ll find life more 
comfortable than if you lodge 
with a private fam’ly. Bein’ 
a young unmarried man — ” he 
twisted his nose suggestively 
— “you’d naturally want a bit of 
freedom, excitement.” 

“Remember he’s a librarian,” 
Piq whistled. “He might not ap- 
preciate as good a time as most 
young fellers.” 

Clarey was glad when a cluster 
of domes appearing over the 
horizon indicated that they’d 
reached Katund. He looked 
about him curiously. The country- 
side he’d been able to equate 
with a park, but this small 
aggregate of detached dwellings 
bore no relationship to anything 
in his experience. 

His kit was dexterously re- 
moved from his hand. “Guess 
you’ll want to check in first,” 
Hanxi said, “so I’ll just take your 
gear over to the inn for you.^' 

He pointed out a small dome 
shading from lavender at the 
bottom to rose pink on top. Over 
the door were glittering symbols 
which Clarey was able to de- 
cipher after a moment’s concen- 
tration as “Dordonec District 
Public Library — Katund

Branch,” and underneath, in 
smaller letters, “Please Blow 
Nose Before Entering.” 

Hesitantly, he touched the 
screen that covered the portway. 
It rolled back. He went inside. 

At his first sight of what filled 
the shelves from floor to topmost 
curve of the dome, Clarey be- 
came charged with fury. The 
ancient books in the glass cases 
back on Earth were of a different 
shape and substance, but, “My 
God,” he cried aloud, “it’s nothing 
but another archive!” 

The female in charge glared 
at him. “Silence, please!” 

Suddenly the anger left him,^ 
and the fear. He was no longer a 
stranger on a strange world. He 
was an archivist in an archive. 

She took a better look at him 
and " the local equivalent of a 
bright smile shone on her face. 
“May I help you, til?” she asked 
in a softer, sweeter voice. 

“I am Balt, tial,” he said, “I 
am the new librarian.” 

She came out from behind the 
desk to offer the ceremonial toe 
touch. “I’m Embelsira, the head 
librarian, and I am very glad to 
see you!” Her tone was warm; 
she really seemed to mean it. 
“Everything’s in such a mess,” 
she went on. “I’ve needed help 
so very badly, so very long,” She 
looked up at him, for she was a 
good deal shorter than he. “So 
glad,” she murmured, “so very. 



very glad to see you, really.” 

“Well, now you have help,” he 
said with quiet strength. “Where 
are the files?” 

They were written instead of 
punched, of alien design, in an 
alien language, arranged accord- 
ing to alien patterns, but he 
understood them at a glance. 
“These will need to be re- 
organized from top to bottom,” 
he said. 

“Yes, Til Balt,” she said de- 
murely. “Whatever you say.” 

/^NCE EVERY six months, 
^ Clarey went for a long week- 
end to visit his “Aunt Askidush” 
in Barshwat. Barshwat was the 
largest city on Darmorlan; it 
was the capital of Vintnor — 
the greatest nation. Earthmen, 
Clarey thought, as he traveled 
there in the comparative luxury 
of a first-class compartment — 
as a rich nephew, he saw no real 
reason to travel third-class — 
were disgustingly obvious. 

That first time, he was five 
hours late, and Blynn was a 
nervous wreck. “I was afraid 
you’d been killed or discovered 
or God knows,” he babbled, 
practically embracing Clarey in 
a fervency of relief. “I was 
afraid — ” 

“Come, come. Colonel,” Clarey 
interrupted, striding past him, 
“you know how inefficient Dam- 
orlant transport is, and I had to 



26 



GALAXY 



make two chain connections.” 
“Of course,” the colonel said, 
wiping the perspiration off his 
forehead. “Of course. And you 
must be dead tired. Sit down; let 
me take your cloak - — ” 

“How about the servants?” 
Clarey asked. 

“This is their weekend off.” 
Blynn pulled himself together. 
“Really, my dear fellow, I’ve 
been in this business longer than 
you. I know what precautions to 
take.” 

“Never can be too careful.” 

“I see you’ve got yourself an- 
other cloak,” the colonel said as 
he hung it in the guest snap. 
“Very handsome. I’ve never seen 
one like it.” 

“Yes. As a matter of fact, 
several people on the chains 
wanted to know where I’d got it” 
“Where did you get it?” asked 
Blynn, feeling the material. 
“Might go well as an export.” 
“Afraid it couldn’t be exported. 
It’s a custom job, you see. Hand- 
woven, hand-decorated. It was a 
birthday present.” 

The colonel stared at him. 
“Well,” Clarey said, “if you 
didn’t expect me to get birthday 
presents, you shouldn’t have put 
a birth date on my identity 
papers. My boss baked me a 
melxhane — ” 

“Your boss!” 

“The relationship between em- 
ployer and employee is much 



different from the way it is on 
Earth,” Clarey explained. Reach- 
ing over, he flipped the switch 
on the recorder and repeated the 
statement, adding, “Embelsira is 
kind, considerate, helpful; she 
can’t do enough for me.” He put 
his mouth close to the mech- 
anism. “Be sure to tell MacFingal 
that.” 

“Now, now,” the colonel said, 
turning the switch off. He pushed 
a small tea wagon over to 
Clarey. “You must be starving. 
Have some sandwiches and 
coffee. I’m sure you’ll be glad to 
taste good Earth food again.” 

“Yes, indeed,” Clarey said, try- 
ing not to make a face. “Er — 
shouldn’t we start recording 
while everything’s fresh in my 
mind?” 

“Might as well,” the colonel 
said, flipping the switch again. 
“Pity we don’t have a probe here. 
Would save so much time. But, 
of course, it’s an expensive instal- 
lation. All right, Clarey, over to 
you.” 

^LAREY choked on a mouth- 
^ ful of sandwich and hesitated. 
“Begin with your very first im- 
pressions,” the colonel urged. 

“Well, the archives — the 
library — was in a real mess. 
Took me over two weeks to get it 
in even roughly decent shape. 
Three different systems of classi- 
fication and, added to that — ” 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



27 



“Not so much the library, old 
chap. Leave the technical stuff 
for later. What I meant was yoiu- 
first impressions of the natives 
. Is something wrong with the 
coffee? And you’ve hardly 
touched your sandwich. Maybe 
you’d like another kind. I have 
several varieties here — ham 
and cheese and — ” 

“Oh, no,” Clarey protested. 
“The one I have is fine. It’s just 
that I’m — well, to tell you the 
truth,” he confessed, “I’ve grown 
accustomed to Damorlant food.” 
“Don’t see how you could,” the 
colonel said. “Nauseating stuff — 
to my way of thinking,” he added 
politely. He opened a sandwich 
and inspected the filling. 

“You’ve only eaten at public 
places. Even the better restau- 
rants don’t put themselves out 
for Earthmen, say they have no 
— palates, I guess the word 
would be. But you ought to taste 
my landlady’s cooking!” 

“All this is being taped, you 
know. They’ll have to listen to 
every word on Earth.” 

“If only I could convey the 
true picture through words. Her 
ragouts are rhapsodies, her souf- 
fles symphonies — I’m using 
rough Terrestrial equivalents, of 
course — ” 

“The cuisine comes later, 
please. Over-all impressions first.” 
“Well,” Clarey began again, “at 
first I was a bit surprised that 



you’d stuck me in a quarter-credit 
place like Katund. Naturally in 
a village the people’d be more 
backward than in the cities, so 
you’d have a poorer idea of how 
they were developing. Then I 
realized that you couldn’t help 
putting me there, that you prob- 
ably couldn’t write a letter good 
enough to get me a job in any of 
the big centers. Embelsira said 
she was surprised to find me so 
much more literate than she 
would have expected from the 
letter.” 

The colonel sat erect huffily. 
“I’ve never pretended to be a 
philologist. And, anyway, Dam- 
orlan isn’t like Earth. Here the 
heartbeat of the planet is in its 
villages.” 

“Earth hasn’t any villages, so 
the comparison doesn’t apply.” 
Clarey cleared his throat. “Don’t 
you have anything to drink ex- 
cept coffee?” 

“Tea?” 

“That would be better. Do you 
know the Katundi have a special 
variety of tea, or something very 
like it, which is — ” 

“Tell me what they think of 
Earthmen,” the colonel inter- 
rupted desperately. 

“Not much. What I mean is, 
nobody in Katund’s actually had 
any contact with them, though 
they’ve heard of them, of course. 
Every now and then there’s a 
little article in the Dordonec Bul- 



28 



GALAXY 



letin from their Barshwat corres- 
pondent, and sometimes, if there 
isn’t any real news, he gives a 
couple of inches to the Earth- 
men.” 

“Exactly how do they regard 
us?” the colonel asked as he 
spooned tea into the pot. “Demi- 
gods? Superior beings? Are they 
in great awe of us?” 

“They regard us as visitors 
from another planet,” Clarey 
said. “They don’t realize from 
quite how far away we hail, 
think it’s only a matter of a solar 
system or two, but they’ve got 
the general idea. Don’t forget, 
they may not be a mechanical 
people, but they do have some 
idea of astronomy. They’re not 
illiterate clods.” 

“What do they think of our 
spaceships? Great silver birds, 
something like that?” 

SIGHING deeply, Clarey said, 
“They think our spaceships 
are cars that fly through the sky 
without tracks. And they think 
it’s silly, our having machines to 
fly in the sky and none to go on 
the ground. There’s an old 
Dordonec proverb: ‘One must 
run before one must fly.’ Origin- 
ally applied to birds, but — ” 
“But what else do they think 
about us?” 

Clarey was hurt. “That’s what 
I was getting to, if you’ll only 
give me time. After all, I’ve been 



speaking Vangtort for six months 
and it’s a little hard to go back 
to Terran and organize my 
thoughts at the same time.” 
“Terribly sorry,” the colonel 
apologized, handing him a cup 
of tea. “Carry on.” 

“Thank you. They say if you 
— if we — are so smart, why do 
we use hax or the chains like 
anybody else? They think some- 
body else must have given us the 
starships, or else we stole them. 
That’s mostly Piq’s idea; he’s the 
village lawyer and, of course, 
lawyers are apt to think in terms 
like that.” 

“Um,” the colonel said. “We 
didn’t think it would be a good 
idea to introduce ground cars. 
Upset their traffic and cause 
dissatisfied yearnings.” 

“They’re satisfied with their 
hax carts. The3^re not in any 
hurry to get anywhere. But 
Katund’s a village. Attitudes 
may be different in the cities.” 
“You stick with your village, 
old chap. If you feel a wild urge 
for city life, you can always take 
a weekend trip to Zrig. Stay at 
the Zrig Grasht; it’s the only 
decent inn. By the way, you 
spoke of a landlady. Do you 
mean at the inn?” 

No, Clarey told him, at first he 
had put up at the inn, but he 
found the place noisy, the cook- 
ing poor, and the pallet covers 
dirty. Besides, Hanxi had kept 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



29 



importuning him to go on visits 
to a nearby township where he 
promised him a good time. 

“I was wondering, though,” 
Clarey finished, “if it would be 
possible for an Earthman and a 
Damarlent to — er — have a 
good time together.” 

“Been wondering myself!” the 
colonel said eagerly. “I didn’t 
dare ask on my own behalf, but 
it’s your job, isn’t it? I’ll check 
back with the X-T boys on 
Earth. Go on with your story.” 

ASA RESIDENT of the inn, 
Clarey told Colonel Blynn, 
he’d found that he was expected 
to join the men in the bar parlor 
every evening, where they’d drink 
and exchange appropriate stories. 
But he’d choked on the squfur 
and was insufficiently familiar 
with the local mores to be able 
to appreciate the stories, let 
alone tell any. He’d concentrated 
on smiling and agreeing with 
whatever anybody said, with the 
result that the others began to 
agree with Piq that he was a bit 
cracked. “They were, for the 
most part, polite enough to me, 
but I could sense the gulf. I was 
a stranger, a city man, and prob- 
ably a bit of a lunatic.” 

A few of the younger ones 
hadn’t even been polite. “They 
used to insult me obliquely,” 
Clarey went on, “and whisper 
things I only half-heard. I pre- 



tended I didn’t hear at all. I 
stood them drinks and told them 
what a lovely place Katund was, 
so much cleaner and prettier and 
friendlier than the city. That just 
seemed to confirm their impres- 
sion that I was an idiot.” 

He stopped, took a sip of tea, 
and continued, “The females 
were friendly enough, though. 
Every time they came into the 
library they’d always stop for a 
chat. And they were very hos- 
pitable — invited me to outdoor 
luncheons, temple gatherings, 
things like that. Embelsira — 
she’s the chief librarian — got 
quite annoyed because she said 
they made so much noise when 
they all gathered round my 
desk.” 

He paused and blushed. “I 
have an idea that — well, the 
ladies don’t find me unattractive. 
I mean they’re not really ladies. 
That is, they’re perfect ladies; 
they’re just not women.” 

“I’m not a bit surprised,” the 
colonel nodded sagely. “Very 
well-set-up young fellow for a 
native — only natural they 
should take a liking to you. And 
only natural the men shouldn’t.” 

Clarey gave an embarrassed 
grin. “One evening I was sitting 
in the bar-parlor, talking to 
Kuqal and Gazmor, two of the 
older men. And then Mundes 
camo^^ in; he’s the town muscle 
boy. You know the type — one

in every tri-di series. He was 
rather unpleasant. I pretended to 
think he was joking. I’ve learned 
to laugh like one of them. Listen.” 
He gave a creditable imitation of 
an agonized turshi. 

T he colonel shuddered. “I’m 
sure if anything would con- 
vince the chaps back on Earth 
that the Damorlanti aren’t 
human, that would do it. What 
then?” 

“Finally he made a remark 
impugning the virility of librar- 
ians that I simply could not 
ignore, so I emptied my mug of 
squfur in his face.” 

“Stout fellow!” 

“I knew he’d attack me and 
probably beat me up, but I 
thought that perhaps if I put up 
a show of courage they’d respect 
me. There was something like 
that in Sentries of the Sky a year 
or so ago — but of course you’d 
have missed that episode; you 
were up here. Anyhow, as I ex- 
pected, he hit me. And then I hit 
him ...” He smiled reminis- 
cently into his cup of tea. 

“And then?” 

“I beat him,” Clarey said 
simply. “I still can’t figure out 
how I did it. I think it must be 
because my muscles are heavier- 
gravity type.” He smiled again. 
“And I beat him good. He 
couldn’t dance at the temple for 
weeks.” 

SENTRY OF THE SKY 



The colonel’s jaw dropped. 
“He’s a temple dancer?” 

“Chief temple dancer. I was a 
little worried about that, because 
I didn’t want to get in bad 
theologically. So I went to the 
priest and apologized for any 
inconvenience I might have 
caused. He said not to worry; 
Mundes had had it coming to 
him for a long time and his one 
regret was that he hadn’t been 
there to see it. Then we touched 
toes and he said he liked to see 
a young fellow with brawn who 
also took an interest in cultural 
pursuits like reading. He trusted 
I’d have a beneficial effect on the 
youth of the village. And then he 
asked me to fill in for Mundes as 
chief temple dancer until he — 
ah — recovered. It’s a great 
honor, you know!” he said 
sharply, as the colonel seemed 
more moved to mirth than awe. 
“But I’ve never been much of a 
dancing man and that’s what I 
told him.” 

“Very well done,” the colonel 
said approvingly. “But you still 
haven’t explained where you got 
lodgings and a landlady.” 

“She’s Embelsira’s mother. I 
was invited over for dinner from 
time to time . It’s a local 
custom,” he explained as Blynn’s 
eyebrows went up. “So, when 
Embelsira told me her mother 
happened to have a compart- 
ment to let with meals included, 

31

I jumped at it. Blynn, you really 
ought to taste those pastries of 
hers!” 

The colonel managed to di- 
vert him onto some of the other 
aspects of Katundut life. When 
he’d finished taping everything 
he had to say, the colonel gave 
him a list of artifacts and small- 
sized flora and fauna the special- 
ists on Earth wanted him to 
collect for his next trip, providing 
he could do so without arousing 
attention or violating tabus. 

They shook hands. “Clarey,” 
the colonel said, “you’ve done 



splendidly. Earth will be proud 
of you. And you might bring 
along one or two of those 
pastries, by the way.” 

\1THEN Clarey got back to 
Katund, Embelsira and her 
mother gave a little welcome 
home party for him. “Nothing 
elaborate,” the widow said. “Just 
a few neighbors and friends, 
some simple refreshments.” 

The tiny residential dome was 
packed with people; the refresh- 
ments, Clarey thought, as he 
munched industriously, were 



magnificent. But then he’d been 
forced to live on Earth food for 
a weekend, so he was no judge. 

After they’d finished eating, 
the young people folded the 
furniture, and, while one of the 
boys played upon a curious in- 
strument that was string and 
percussion and brass all at once, 
the others danced. 

Clarey made no attempt to 
participate. In his early youth, 
he’d flopped at the Earth hops — 
and the Damorlanti had a 
distinctly more Dionysian cul- 
ture than his home world. He 



stood and watched them leaping 
and twirling. When they’d drop- 
ped, temporarily exhausted, he 
made his way over to the 
musician, whom he recognized as 
one of Piq’s numerous grandsons; 
this one was Rini, he thought. 

“Is that difficult to learn?” he 
asked, touching the instrument. 

“The ulerin is extremely diffi- 
cult,” the boy said importantly. 
“It takes years and years of 
practice. And you’ve got to have 
the touch to begin with. Not 
many do. All our family have the 
touch, my brother Irik most of 



I ;

all. He’s in Barshwat, studying 
to be a famous musician.” 

Clarey looked at the ulerin 
with unmistakable wistfulness. 

“Care to try it?” the boy asked. 
“But, mind, you have to pay for 
any bladders you burst.” 

“I shall be very careful,” 
Clarey said, taking the instru- 
ment reverently in his hands. He 
had never touched a musical 
instrument before — an Earth 
instrument would have been no 
less unfamiliar, no more wonder- 
ful. Gently he began to pluck 
and bang and blow, in imitation 
of the way the boy had done, 
and, though the sounds that 
came out didn’t have the same 
smoothness, still they didn’t fall 
harshly on his ears. The others 
stopped talking and listened; it 
would have been difficult for 
them to do otherwise, as he was 
unable to find the muting device. 

“Sounds like the death wail of 
a hix,” Piq sibilated, but he 
added grudgingly, “Foreigner or 
not, I have to say this for him — 
he’s got the touch.” 

“Yes, he’s got the touch,” 
others agreed. “You always can 
tell.” 

Rini smiled at Clarey. “I be- 
lieve you do. I’ll teach you to 
play, if you like.” 

“I would, very much.” Clarey 
was about to offer to pay for the 
lessons; then he remembered 
that, though this would have 



been the right thing on Earth, it 
would be wrong on Damorlan. 
“If it is not too much trouble,” he 
finished. 

“It’s the kind of trouble I like.” 
The boy twisted his nose at 
Clarey. “Sometime you can hide 
the reserved books for me.” 

A FTER the guests had gone, 
Clarey insisted on helping 
the women with the putting 
away. “Well, as long as Embel- 
sira has a pair of brawny arms 
to help her,” the widow yawned, 
“I might as well be getting along 
to my pallet. I seem to get more 
and more tired these days — old 
age, I expect. One day I’ll be so 
tired I’ll never wake up and 
Embelsira’ll be alone and what’ll 
she do, ^oor thing? Who can 
live on a librarian’s salary? Now, 
on two librarians’ salaries — ” 

“Mother,” Embelsira inter- 
rupted furiously, “you go to bed!” 

She did, hurriedly. 

“Don’t worry, Embelsira,” 
Clarey said. “She will be weaving 
away for decades yet. Everybody 
says she’s the best weaver in the 
district,” he added, to change the 
subject. 

“Yes,” Embelsira said as they 
gathered all the oddments the 
guests had left, “she’s been of- 
fered a lot of money to go work 
in Zrig. But she won’t leave 
Katund; she was born here, and 
so were her parents.”

r 



“I do not blame her for want- 
ing to stay,” he said. “It’s a very 
— homelike place.” 

She sighed. “To us it is, but I 
I don’t suppose someone who’s 
city born and bred would feel 
the same way. I know you won’t 
let yourself stay buried here 
forever, and what will I — what 
j will Mother and I ever do with- 
out you?” 

“It is — very kind of you to 
, say so,” he replied. “I am 
honored.” 

The girl — she was still young 
enough to be called a girl, though 
, no longer in her first youth — 

, looked up at him. Blue eyes 
could be pleasing in their way. 
“Why are you always so stiff, 
so cold?” 

“I am not cold,” he said 
honestly. “I am — afraid.” 

“There is nothing to be afraid 
■ of. You’re safe, among friends, 
no matter what you may have 
done back where you came 
from.” 

“But I have done nothing back 
there,” he said. “Nothing at all. 

I Perhaps that is the trouble with 
me. 

She looked up at him and then 
away. “Then isn’t it about time 
you started to do something?” 

^^HE NEXT time he went to 

Barshwat he took a lot of 
luggage with him, because, be- 
sides the artifacts and the flora 



and fauna, he brought cold 
pastries for the colonel. The 
colonel ate one in silence, then 
said, “Try to get the recipe.” 

“By the way,” said Clarey, 
“the X-T boys made a few 
mistakes. The bugg isn’t an 
insect; it’s a bird. And the 
lule isn’t a bird; it’s a flower. 
And the paparun isn’t a flower; 
it’s an insect.” 

“Oh, well, I guess they’ll be 
able to straighten that out,” the 
colonel said, licking crumbs from 
his thick fingers. “We do our jobs 
and they do theirs.” He reached 
for another pastry. 

“Take good care of the bugg,” 
Clarey said. “He likes his morn- 
ing seed mixed with milk; his 
evening seed with wine. His 
name is Mirti. He’s very tame 
and affectionate. I — said I was 
bringing him to my aunt ...” 
He paused. “You are going to 
take him back alive, aren’t you? 
You’d get so much more informa- 
tion that way.” 

“Wouldn’t dream of hurting a 
hair — a feather — no, it is 
a hair, isn’t it? — of the little 
fellow’s head.” 

Clarey looked out of the win- 
dow at the purple night sky. 
Then he turned back to the 
colonel. “I’ve been taking music 
lessons,” he said defiantly. 

“Fine! Every man should have 
a hobby!” 

“But I’ve no music license.”

“Come now, Clarey. You still 
don’t seem to realize you’re 
on Damorlan, not Earth. Not a 
blooded intelligence man yet! 
There aren’t any guilds on Dam- 
orlan, so enjoy yourself.” 

“Speaking of that, did you find 
out about — er — Earthmen 
and — ” 

“Yes, I’d meant to drop you a 
note, but it seemed rather odd 
information for your aunt to be 
giving you. It’s absolutely all 
right, old chap. Go ahead, have 
your bit of fun.” 

Clarey was unreasonably an- 
noyed. “I wasn’t thinking of what 
you’re thinking. I mean — well, 
Katund is a village and the na- 
tive morality is very strict in 
these matters.” 

“Afraid I don’t quite follow 
you.” 

Clarey bit his finger. “Well,” 
he finally admitted, “the truth of 
the matter is I’d like to get 
married.” 

The colonel was extremely 
surprised. “A legal arrangement! 
Is it absolutely necessary? How 
about the females that the inn- 
keeper’s so anxious to have you 
— ah — meet?” 

C LAREY didn’t know how to 
explain. “I'heir standards of 
cleanliness ...” he began, and 
stopped. Then he started again: 
“I suppose I’d like a permanent 
companion.” 

36 



“I don’t suppose there’s any 
real reason why you shouldn’t 
enter into a legal liaison while 
you’re here,” said the colonel. 
“After all, it isn’t as if the two 
races could interbreed. That 
could be decidedly awkward. 
Who’s the lucky little lady?” 
“My landlady’s daughter,” 
Clarey said. 

“Your boss, eh? Flying high, 
aren’t you, old chap?” His mas- 
sive hand descended on Clarey’s 
shoulder. Then he grew serious. 
“Can she cook like her mother?” 
“Even better.” 

“My boy,” the colonel said 
solemnly, “you have my unquali- 
fied blessing. And when I ask you 
to save me a piece of the wed- 
ding cake, I ask from the heart.” 
So, when Clarey went back to 
Katund, he asked Embelsira to 
marry him and she accepted. The 
whole village turned out for the 
wedding. Clarey managed to take 
some vocpix of the ceremonies 
for the X-Ts with a finger unit. 
I ought to get a handsome wed- 
ding present for this, he thought. 

And, to his surprise, on the 
wedding day, an elaborate jewel- 
studded toilet service did arrive 
from Barshwat — with the affec- 
tionate regards of his aunt, who 
was too ill to travel. They tie up 
everything, he thought, but he 
knew it was a little more than 
simply remembering to pick up 
a loose end. The toilet set was 

GALAXY 



vulgar, ostentatious, hideous — 
obviously selected with loving 
care and Terrestrial taste. 

Everybody in Katund and a 
lot of people from the surround- 
ing country came to look at it. It 
seemed to establish his eligibility 
beyond a doubt. “Never thought 
’Belsira’d do it, and at her age, 
too,” Piq was heard to comment. 
“But it looks like she really got 
herself a catch. What’s a little 
weakness in the dome-top when 
there’s money, too?” 

^T^HE FIRST three years of 
Clarey’s marriage were happy 
ones. He and Embelsira got on 
very nicely together and, since 
he was fond of her mother, he 
didn’t mind her constant pres- 
ence too much. Once a week he 
took a ulerin lesson from Rini. 
He practiced assiduously and 
made progress that he himself 
could see was sensational. He did 
wish that Rini would accept 
money; it would have been so 
much less of a nuisance than 
replacing the music books the 
boy stole from the library, but 
he couldn’t expect local customs 
to coincide with his own. The 
money, of course, didn’t matter; 
he still wasn’t living up to his 
allowance, although he was be- 
ginning to spread himself on 
elaborate custom-made cloaks 
and tunics. On Earth he had 
dressed soberly, according to his 

SENTRY OF THE SKY 



status, but here he felt entitled 
to cut a dash. 

At the colonel’s request, on 
his next trip to Barshwat he 
brought his ulerin and taped 
some native melodies. “I like 
’em,” the colonel said, nodding 
his head emphatically. “Catchy, 
very catchy. Hope the X-Ts ap- 
preciate them; they don’t usually 
like music if it sounds at all 
human.” And, catching the look 
on Clarey’s face, “Well, you know 
what I mean. To them, if a tune 
can be hummed, it isn’t au- 
thentic.” 

News of Clarey’s skill on the 
ulerin spread through the 
countryside. When he played in 
the temple concerts, people 
sometimes came from as far 
away as Zrig to hear him. Clarey 
was a little disturbed about this, 
because he didn’t subscribe to 
the local faith. But the high 
priest said, “My son, music 
knows no religious boundaries. 
Besides, when you play, we al- 
ways get three times as much in 
the collection nets.” 

At the time Clarey got word 
from Barshwat that General 
Spano and the staff ship were 
expected shortly, he had risen to 
the post of chief librarian. Em- 
belsira had retired to keep dome 
and wait for the young ones who 
would, of course, never come. 
Clarey had hired a hixhead of an 
assistant from Zrig to assist him; 



37 



he saw now why the village had 
originally been grateful to get 
even a foreigner of doubtful 
background for the job. 

“I’m going to have to stay at 
least a week with Aunt Askush 
this time,” he told his wife. “Legal 
matters. I think she’s drawing up 
a will or some such,” he added, 
hoping that this would keep 
Embelsira happy and convinced. 

Maybe it worked too well. 
“But why can’t I come with you? 
I’ve always wanted so much to 
meet her.” 

“I keep telling you her illness 
is a disfiguring one; she won’t 
meet strangers. And don’t say 
you’re not a stranger — you’d 
understand, but she’s the one 
who wouldn’t. Please don’t nag 
me, Belsir.” 

“Sometimes I think you’re a 
stranger, Balt,” Embelsira de- 
clared emotionally. 

“Yes, dear, I’m a stranger, any- 
thing you say, but let me get 
packed.” He started folding a 
robe crookedly, hoping it would 
distract her into taking over the 
job. 

But she leaned against the 
lintel, staring at him. “Balt, 
sometimes I wonder if you 
really have an aunt.” 

The only thing he allowed 
himself to do was put down the 
robe he was holding. “Do you 
think I send expensive toilet sets 
to myself? You must think Piq’s 



right — I’m just plain crazy.” 
“Piq doesn’t think you’re crazy 
any more. He and the other old 
ones say you have a woman in 
Barshwat. But I don’t believe 
that!” 

“Maybe I do, Embelsira. A 
man’s a man, even if he is a 
librarian.” 

“I know it isn’t true. I think 
it’s . something else entirely. 
You’re so strange sometimes, 
Balt. How could somebody who 
comes only from the other side 
of the same world be so strange?” 

TTE forced a grin. “Suddenly 
you’ve become very cosmic. 
What do you know of our — of 
the world? It’s a big place. And 
nobody else in Katund seems to 
be so impressed by my strange- 
ness; they think a foreigner’s 
entitled to his queer ways.” 
“Nobody in Katund knows 
you as well as I do. And I’ve 
seen foreigners before. They’re 
not different in the way you are.” 
She looked intently at him. “It’s 
not a shameful kind of strange- 
ness, just a . strange kind of 
strangeness. Fascinating in its 
way — I don’t want you to think 
I just married the first stranger 
who came along ...” 

“I’m sure you had many offers, 
dear. Come, help me fold this 
cloak or I’ll never make the bus.” 
“You know what I’m reminded 
of?” she said, coming forward 



38 



GALAXY 



and taking the cloak. “Of the old 
tale about the lovely village 
maiden who marries the hand- 
some stranger and promises 
she’ll never look into his eyes. 
And then one day she forgets 
and looks into his eyes and 
sees — ” 

“What does she see?” 

“The worst thing of all, the 
greatest horror. She sees nothing. 
She sees emptiness.” 

He laughed. “The moral’s 
clear. She shouldn’t have looked 
into his eyes.” 

“But how can you help looking 
into the eyes of the man you 
love? Maybe that’s the moral — 
that it was an impossible task he 
set her.” 

“In those tales it’s always the 
man’s fault, isn’t it? Not much 
doubt who made them up. Now, 
Belsir, please, I’ve got to finish 
packing. It’ll be just my luck to 
have today be the day the bus to 
Zrig’s on time.” 

“A couple of weeks ago I was 
in Zrig shopping and I saw an 
Earthman,” she said, folding his 
cloak into the kit. “The way he 
walked, the way he moved, re- 
minded me a little of you.” 

It was a long moment before 
he could speak. “Do I look to 
you like a dark-faced, dark- 
haired, brown-eyed — ” 

“I didn’t say you were an 
Earthman! But if Earthmen can 
travel through the sky, they 



might be able to do other things, 
too; maybe even change the way 
a man looks.” 

He snapped the kit-fastener. 
“If you really believe that, you 
should be careful. Creatures as 
clever as that might be able to 
pluck your words from my 
brain.” 

“What if they did? I’m not 
ashamed. Or afraid, either.” 

He reached out and patted her 
arm. Maybe she wasn’t afraid, 
but he was. For her. And for the 
people of Damorlan. If there was 
a deep-probe on the staff ship . 
If only something could happen 
to him, so he could never reach 
Barshwat . Spano wouldn’t 
know. He might guess, but he 
wouldn’t know. He’d have to 
start all over again — and 
maybe things would turn out 
better next time. 

ENERAL SPANO and his 
secretary were waiting in 
Blynn’s office. Clarey stretched 
out his foot in greeting, then 
recollected himself and reached 
out his hand. “You see, sir,” he 
said with a too-hearty laugh, 
“I’m really living my part.” 

spano beamed. “Damorlan 
certainly seems to agree with 
you, my boy. You look positively 
blooming. Doesn’t he, Han?” 

She nodded grave agreement. 
The general sniffed. “What’s 
that you two are smoking?” 




SENTRY OF THE SKY

“Marac leaves,” Clarey said. 
“A native product. Care to try 
one?” He extended his pouch to 
Spano. 

“Don’t mind if I do,” the 
general said, taking a roll. 
“Which part do you light? And 
why don’t you offer one to 
Secretary Vollard?” 

“Oh, sorry; I didn’t think of it. 
The women here don’t use it. 
Care to try one. Secretary?” As 
she took a roll, she looked at 
him searchingly. She was still 
beautiful in an Amazonian way, 
but he preferred Embelsira’s way. 
He could never imagine Han Vol- 
lard warm and tender. 

“Well, Clarey,” Spano said, 
“you seem to be doing a splendid 
job. I’ve been absolutely en- 
thralled by your reports.” He 
settled himself behind Blynn’s 
desk. “Pity the information’s top 
secret. It could make a fortvme 
on the tri-dis.” 

Clarey bowed. 

“And those musictapes you 
sent back created quite a stir. 
We’ve brought along some su- 
perior equipment. The rig here is 
gpod enough for routine work, 
but we need better fidelity for 
this. And it would be appreciated 
if the colonel didn’t beat time 
with his foot while you played 
— no offense, Blynn.” 

He turned back to Clarey. “Do 
you think you can pick up some 
of those what-do-you-call-’ems 



— ulerins — for us, too, or is 
there a tabu of some kind?” 

“Not ulerins,” Clarey cor- 
rected, “uleran. And you can 
walk up to any marketplace and 
get as many as you like — pro- 
viding you have the cash, of 
course.” 

“I told you the job had 
musical overtones. I’ll bet that 
makes up for some of the dis- 
comforts and privations.” 

“It’s not too uncomfortable.” 
“There speaks a true patriot!” 
Spano approved. 

Han measured Clarey with her 
eyes. “You’re quiet. Secretary,” 
he said nervously. “You used to 
talk a lot more.” 

Blynn stared at him. She 
smiled. “You’re the one who has 
things to tell now, Clarey.” 

“And show,” the general said, 
almost licking his lips. “Every 
one of your tapes made my 
mouth fairly water. I trust you 
brought an ample and varied 
supply of those delicacies.” 
Clarey’s smile was unforced 
this time. “I got your message 
and I brought along a large 
hamparful, but it’ll be hard to 
make the people back home 
keep thinking my aunt’s an in- 
valid if she eats like a team of 
hax. My wife baked some 
pastries, which I especially rec- 
ommend to your attention.” 

“I think we ought to get 
business over before we start on 



40 



GALAXY 



refreshments,” Han suggested. 

“Yes,” Spano agreed reluc- 
tantly. “I suppose you had better 
be deep-probed first, Clarey . 
Not even one taste beforehand, 
Han? . Well, I suppose not.” 
Clarey tensed. “You’ve got a 
probe on the ship?” he asked, as 
if the possibility had never 
occurred to him. 

“That’s right,” Han Vollard 
said. ‘Tt’s an up-to-date model. 
The whole thing’ll take you less 
than an hour, and we’ll have the 
information collated by morning.” 
“I — I would prefer not to be 
deep-probed. You never can tell: 
it might upset all the condition- 
ing I’ve received here; it — ” 
“Let us worry about that, 
Clarey,” she said. 

T¥E DIDN’T sleep that night. 

He sat looking out of the 
window, knowing there was 
nothing he could do. Embelsira 
was in danger — her people 
were in danger — and he 
couldn’t lift a finger to save 
them. 

When he came down to break- 
fast, he saw that the reports had 
been collated and read. “So your 
wife suspects, does she?” the 
general asked. “Shrewd little 
creature. You must have picked 
one of the more intelligent ones.” 
Clarey struggled on the pin. 
“Wives often have strange fan- 
cies about their husbands. You 



mustn’t take it too seriously.” 
“How often have you been 
married, Clarey?” Han asked. 
“Or even linked in liaison? How 
many married people did you 
know well back on Earth?” 
There was no need to answer; 
she knew all the answers. 

“I think Clarey did a rattling 
good job,” Blynn said stoutly. “It 
wasn’t his fault that she sus- 
pects.” 

“Of course not!” the general 
agreed. “Feminine intuition isn’t 
restricted to human females. In 
fact, in some female ilfs it’s even 
stronger than in humans. The 
precognitive faculties in the grua, 
for example — ” 

“What are you going to do?” 
Clarey interrupted bluntly. 

Han Vollard answered him: 
“Nothing yet. You’ve got us a lot 
of information, but it’s not 
enough. You’ll have to keep on 
as you are for another three 
years or so.” 

It was all Clarey could do to 
keep from trembling visibly with 
relief. 

“It doesn’t even matter too 
much that one of the natives 
suspects,” Han went on, “as long 
as she doesn’t definitely know.” 
“She doesn’t,” Clarey said, 
“and she won’t. And she won’t 
tell anybody; she’d be afraid for 
me.” But he wasn’t all that sure. 
The Damorlanti didn’t hate 
Earthmen and they didn’t fear 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



41 



them, and so Embelsira wouldn’t 
think it was a shameful thing to 
be. He was glad he’d already 
been deep-probed. At least this 
thought would be safe for three 
years or so. 

“At any rate, they don’t seem 
antagonistic toward Earthmen,” 
the general said, almost as if he’d 
read part of Clarey’s mind. “I 
think that’s nice.” 

Han Vollard looked at him. 
“It’s not their attitude toward us 
that matters. They couldn’t do 
anything if they tried. It’s what 
they are that matters, what they 
will be that matters even more.” 
“I take back what I said be- 
fore!” Clarey flared. “You talk 
too damn much!” 

There was a chilling silence. 
“Nerves,” said Blynn nerv- 
ously. “Every agent lets go when 
he’s back among his own kind. 
Nothing but release of tension.” 

OEVERAL days later the staff 
^ship was ready to go back to 
Earth. “Don’t forget to tell your 
wife how much I enjoyed the 
pies,” Spano said; then, “Oh, I 
was forgetting; you could hardly 
do that. But do see if you can 
work out something with the 
dehydro-freeze. I’d hate to have 
to wait three years before tasting 
them again. You can keep your 
marac rolls, though; I’ll take my 
smoke-sticks.” 

“Try not to get any more in- 



volved, Clarey,” Han Vollard 
said as they stood outside the 
airlock. “Maybe you ought to 
move on — to a city, perhaps, 
another country — ” 

“When I want your advice. I’ll 
ask for it!” he snapped. 

After they’d gone, Blynn 
turned on him. “Man, you must 
be out of your mind, talking to 
Secretary Vollard like that.” 
“Why does she have to keep 
meddling? It’s none of her bus- 
iness — ” 

“None of her business! Secre- 
tary of the Space Service, and 
you say it’s none of her busi- 
ness?” 

Clarey blinked. “I thought she 
was Spano’s secretary.” 

Blynn laughed until the tears 
dampened his dark cheeks. 
“Spano’s only Head of Intelli- 
gence. She’s his Mistress.” 

“Of course — mistress, femi- 
nine of master! I should have 
realized that before.” Then 
Clarey laughed, too. “I’m a real 
all-round alien. I can’t even 
understand my own language.” 
On the way back home he 
couldn’t help thinking that Han 
Vollard might be right. It could 
be the best thing for him to 
disappear now; the best thing 
for himself, the best thing for 
Embelsira. He could pretend to 
desert her — better yet, Blynn 
could fake some kind of accident, 
so her feelings wouldn’t be hurt.

A pension of some kind would 
be arranged. She could marry 
again, have the children she 
wanted so much. If he waited the 
full ten years, she might never be 
able to have them. He had no 
idea at what age Damorlant 
females ceased to be fertile. 

But she wasn’t just a Damor- 
lant female — she was his wife. 
He didn’t want to leave her. 
Maybe he never would have to. 
Hadn’t Spano said that when his 
term was over he could pick 
his planet? He would pick 
Damorlan. 

wi^HEN Clarey came home 
** from Barshwat, Embelsira 
said nothing more about her sus- 
picions, but greeted him affec- 
tionately and prepared a special 
supper for him. Afterward, he 
wondered if making love to an 
Earth girl could be as pleasant. 
He wondered how it would be to 
make love to Han Vollard. 

The days passed and he forgot 
about Han Vollard. After much 
persuasion, he agreed to give a 
series of concerts at Zrig, but 
only on condition that Rini 
played with him and had one 
solo each performance. He was 
embarrassed at having so far out- 
stripped his teacher, but Rini 
seemed unperturbed. 

“My technique’s still better 
than yours will ever be,” he said. 
“It’s this new style of yours that 



gets ’em. I understand it’s spread- 
ing; it’s reached as far as Bar- 
shwat. You should see the angry 
letters Irik writes about it!” Rini 
chuckled. “And he hasn’t the 
least idea it started right here in 
his own home village that he’s 
always sneered at for being so 
backward!” 

Clarey smiled and clapped the 
boy on the neck. If it made Rini 
feel better to think Clarey had 
a new style rather than that 
Clarey played better than he did, 
Clarey had no objection. 

Clarey was offered the post of 
head librarian at Zrig, but 
Embelsira didn’t want to leave 
Katund, and, when he thought 
about it, he really didn’t want 
to either. So he refused the job 
and didn’t bother mentioning the 
matter to Headquarters. 

As he grew more sure of him- 
self and his position, he allowed 
his wealth to show. He and 
Embelsira moved into a larger 
dome. Instead of sending to Zrig 
or even Barshwat for the furnish- 
ings, they hired local talent. 
Tavan, the carpenter, made them 
some exquisite blackwood pieces 
inlaid with opalescent stone that 
everyone said was the equal of 
anything in Barshwat. A talented 
nephew of Hanxi’s painted glow- 
ing murals; Embelsira’s mother 
wove rugs and draperies in 
muted water-tones. The dome 
became the district showplace. 



SENTRY OF THE SKY

Clarey realized he now had a 
position to keep up, but some- 
times it annoyed him when 
perfect strangers asked to see the 
place. 

He was invited to run against 
Malesor as headman but de- 
clined. He didn’t want to be 
brought into undue prominence. 
Trouble was, as he became pop- 
ular, he also aroused animosity. 
There were the girls who felt he 
should have married them in- 
stead of Embelsira, and their 
mothers and subsequent hus- 
bands. A lot of people resented 
Clarey because they felt he 
should have decorated his house 
differently, dressed differently, 
spent his money differently. 

A man can live ignored by 
everyone, he discovered, but he 
can’t be liked by some without 
finding himself disliked by 
others. 

■jl/TATTERS came to a head in 
his fourth spring there. He 
thought of it as spring, although 
on Damorlan the seasons had no 
separate identities; they blended 
into one another, without its ever 
being very hot or very cold, very 
rainy or very dry. The reason he 
called this time of the year spring 
was that it seemed closest to 
perfection. 

It was less perfect that year. 
Because it was then that Rini’s 
brother Irik came back from 



Barshwat, after a six years’ ab- 
sence. He was very much the city 
man, far more so than anyone 
Clarey had seen in Barshwat it- 
self. His tunics were shorter than 
his fellow villagers’, and his 
cloaks iridesced restlessly from 
one vivid color to another. He 
wore a great deal of jewelry and 
perfume, neither of the best 
quality, and the toes of his boots 
were divided. 

Clarey described this in detail 
to Embelsira the night Irik put 
in his first appearance at the 
Fur bush. “You should have seen 
the little horror!” 



“That’s the way 


city 


men 


dress,” Embelsira told 


him. 


“It’s 


fashionable.” 






“But, dear, I’ve 


been 


to 


Barshwat.” 







“You don’t have an eye for 
clothes. You never notice when 
I put on anything new. And I 
think it’s unfair to take a dislike 
to Irik just because you don’t 
care for the way he dresses.” 
“It’s more than that, Belsira.” 
And yet how could he explain to 
her what he couldn’t quite under- 
stand himself, that Irik was vain, 
stupid, hostile; hence, dangerous? 

“I swear to you, Balt,” Embel- 
sira said demurely, “that what- 
ever there was between me and 
Irik, it all ended six years ago.” 
Clarey gave a start and then 
held back a smile. “I believe you, 
dear.” And he kissed her nose.

TRIK held forth in the Furbush 

every evening of his stay in 
Katund. He had grievances and 
he aired them generously. He 
hated everything — the govern- 
ment, taxes, modern music, and 
Earthmen, whom he seemed to 
consider in some way responsible 
for the modern music, or at least 
its popularization. “Barbarians 
— slept completely through my 
concerts.” 

“But people are always falling 
asleep during concerts, Irik,” 
Malesor pointed out reasonably. 
“And how could you expect bar- 
barians to appreciate good 
music? What do you care for 
Earthmen’s opinions as long as 
your sown people like your 
music?” 

Irik hesitated. “But the Earth- 
men have taken up the new kind 
of music; they stay awake during 
that. And — a lot of people seem 
to think that whatever’s strange 
is good, so whatever the Earth- 
men like eventually becomes 
fashionable.” 

Hanxi wiggled his ears. “Fash- 
ions change. Well, who’s ready 
to have his mug refilled?” 

“But the Earthmen will keep 
on setting the fashions,” Irik 
snarled. “Many people think the 
Earthmen know everything, just 
because they’re aloof and have 
sky cars.” 

“Well,” Malesor said, “the sky 
cars certainly prove they know 



something we don’t. Better stick 
to your music, boy.” 

The smoky little bar-parlor re- 
sounded with laughter and Irik’s 
face turned a nasty red. “They 
don’t know anything about music 
and they don’t know everything 
about machinery. We might sur- 
prise them yet. A friend of mine 
knows Guhak, the fellow who 
invented that new brake for the 
track car a few years ago.” 

“We know about that brake,” 
Piq observed. “It stops a car so 
good, the chains are twice as late 
nowadays as they used to be, and 
you couldn’t strictly say they 
were ever on time.” 

Everybody laughed again. Irik 
quivered with anger. “Guhak has 
invented a car that doesn’t need 
to go on tracks. It can run when- 
ever it wants wherever it wants. 
And one car will be able to go 
faster than three hax teams.” 
“That I’ll believe when I’ve 
ridden on it,” Kuqal grinned. 
“Even the chains aren’t that 
fast.” The others bit their thumbs 
and nodded — except Clarey, 
who was rigidly keeping out of 
the conversation. He forced squ- 
fur down his tightening throat and 
said nothing. 

“You’re backward clods!” Irik 
raged. “If the Earthmen can have 
cars that go through the sky with- 
out tracks why shouldn’t we have 
cars that run on the ground the 
same way? Have we tried?”

GALAXY 



“Doesn’t seem to me it’s worth 
the effort,” Malesor said. “Our 
cars can get us where we’re going 
as fast as we need to go already, 
why bother?” 

“Whatever an Earthman can 
do, we can do better! Soon Guhak 
will get his ground cars on the 
road. After that, it’ll only be a 
short step to cars that go in the 
sky. Then we’ll find out where the 
Earthmen come from and why 
they’re here. We’ll be as powerful 
as they are. We’ll get rid of them 
and their rotten music.” 

The bar parlor was silent, ex- 
cept for the clink as Clarey put 
his mug on the table. If he held 
it an instant longer, he was afraid 
he would spill it. One or two of 
the men looked at him uneasily 
out of the corners of their eyes. 
Malesor spoke: “In the first place, 
you don’t know how powerful 
Earthmen are. In the second 
place, who wants to be poWrful, 
anyway? The Earthmen haven’t 
done us any harm and they’re a 
good thing for the economy. My 
cousin in Zrig tells me one of ’em 
come into his store a coupla 
months ago and bought out his 
whole stock, every bolt of cloth. 
Paid twice what it was worth, too. 
Live and let live, I say.” 

The others murmured restless- 
ly- 

“If there are ways of doing 
things better,” Rini suggested, 
“why shouldn’t we have them. 



too?” His eyes darted quickly 
toward Clarey’s and then as 
quickly away. 

Irik turned his head and 
looked directly at Clarey for the 
first time. “You’re silent, stranger. 
What do you think of the Earth- 
men?” 

^LAREY picked up his drink, 
^ finished the squfur and set 
the mug back down on the table. 
“I don’t know much about Earth- 
men. An ugly-looking lot, true, 
but there doesn’t seem to be any 
harm in them. Of course, living 
in Barshwat, you probably know 
a lot more about them than I do.” 
“I doubt that,” Irik said. “You 
have an aimt in Barshwat.” 
Clarey allowed himself to look 
surprised before he said courte- 
ously, “I’m glad you find riie and 
my family so interesting. Yes, it 
so happens I do have an aunt 
there, but she’s rather advanced 
in years and doesn’t enjoy hang- 
ing around the starship field the 
way the children do.” 

Irik’s face darkened. ‘What is 
your aunt’s name?” 

This time everyone looked sur- 
prised. The question' itself was not 
too out-of-the-way, but his tone 
decidedly was. 

“She’s a great-grandmother,” 
Clarey said. “She would be too 
old for you. And I assure you it’s 
difficult to part her from her 
money. I’ve tried.” 



SENTRY OF THE SKY

Everybody laughed. Irik was 
furious. “I understand that your 
aunt lives very close to Earth 
Headquarters ! ” 

Somebody must have followed 
him on one or more of his trips to 
Barshwat, Clarey realized. “If the 
Earthmen chose to establish 
themselves in the best residential 
section of Barshwat, then prob- 
ably my aunt does live near them. 
She’s not the type to leave a 
comfortable dome simply because 
foreigners move into the neigh- 
borhood.” 

“Perhaps she has more than 
neighborhood in common with 
Earthmen.” 

The room was suddenly very 
quiet again. 

“She does sometimes go to 
sleep at concerts,” Clarey con- 
ceded. 

Irik opened his mouth. Male- 
sor held up a hand. “Before you 
say anything more against the 
Earthmen, Irik,” he advised, “you 
oughta find out more about them. 
Their cars move faster and higher 
than ours. Maybe their catapults 
do, too.” 

No one looked at Clarey. Male- 
sor had averted a showdown, he 
knew, but this was the beginning 
of the end. And he had a suspicion 
who was responsible — innocently 
perhaps, perhaps not. Love does 
not always imply trust. And when 
he told Embelsira what had hap- 
pened in the Furbush, she, too. 



couldn’t meet his eye. ‘That 
Irik,” she said, “I never liked 
him.” 

“I wonder how he knows so 
much about me.” 

“Rini writes him very often,” 
she babbled. “He must have told 
him you were responsible for 
the new music. That would make 
him hate you. Rini likes to irri- 
tate Irik, because he’s always 
been jealous of him. But the 
whole thing’s silly. How could 
you possibly make over the 
world’s music, even if you were 
— ” Her voice ran down. 

“An* Earthman?” he finished 
coldly. “I suppose you went 
around telling everybody your 
suspicions, and Rini wrote that 
to Irik, too?” 

66T DIDN’T tell anybody!” she 
protested indignantly. “Not 
a soul!” She met his eye. “Except 
Mother, of course.” 

“Your mother! You might as 
well have published it in the Dis- 
trict Bulletin!” 

“You have no right to speak 
of Mother like that, even if it’s 
true!” Embelsira began to sob. 
“I had to tell her, Balt — she 
kept asking why there weren’t 
any young ones.” 

“You could’ve told her to mind 
her own business!” he snapped, 
before he could catch himself. 
Five years, and he still made 
slips. It was her business. On 



48 



GALAXY 



Damorlan, it was a woman’s duty 
not only to have children but to 
see that her children had children 
and their children had children. 

He made himself look grave 
and self-reproachful. “I have a 
confession to make, Belsir. I 
should have told you when I mar- 
ried you. I can’t have children.” 

“I never heard of such a thing! 
Everybody has children — un- 
less they’re not married, of 
course,” she added primly. 

“It’s an affliction sent by the 
gods.” 

“The gods would never do any- 
thing like that!” she declared 
confidently. 

How primitive she is, he 
thought, and, then, angrily, how 
provincial I am! He had never 
stopped to think about it, but he 
knew of no married couple who 
had not at least one offspring; he 
and Embelsira were the only 
ones. It hadn’t occurred to the 
X-T specialists that a species 
whose biological assets were 
roughly the same might have 
different handicaps. Apparently 
there was no such thing as steril- 
ity on Damorlan. 

“Are you really an Earthman, 
then, Balt?” she asked timidly. 

She had spread the news 
around, ruined him, ruined the 
work Earth had been doing, per- 
haps ruined even more than that 
— and she hadn’t even been sure 
to begin with. But it was too late 



for recriminations. He had to 
salvage what little he could — 
time, maybe; that was all. 

“Are you going to tell?” he 
asked. 

She hesitated. “Do you swear 
you don’t mean my people any 
harm?” 

“I swear,” he said. 

‘Then I swear not to tell,” she 
said. 

He kissed her. After all, he 
thought, it isn’t a lie. I don’t 
mean her people any harm. Be- 
sides, sooner or later, her mother 
will get it out of her, so she won’t 
be keeping her part of the bar- 
gain. 

^I^HE NEXT time he went to 
Barshwat he knew he would 
be followed. He tried to shake 
the follower or followers off, but 
he couldn’t be sure he’d suc- 
ceeded. 

He found the colonel looking 
out of the window with an ex- 
pression of quiet melancholy. If 
there had been any Earthwomen 
on Damorlan, Clarey would have 
thought he’d been crossed in 
love. 

“Things are taking a bad turn, 
Clarey,” Blynn said. “There have 
been certain manifestations of 
hostility from the natives. Get 
any hint of it?” 

“No,” Clarey said, taking his 
usual chair, “not a whisper.” 

The colonel sat down heavily. 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



49 



“Katund’s too ouf- of the way. 
We should’ve moved you to a 
city once you’d got the feel of 
things. But you do go to Zrig 
occasionally. Haven’t you heard 
anjrthing there?” 

“Only that an Earthman 
bought out a cloth merchant’s 
entire stock at one blow.” 

Blynn grinned weakly. “Maybe 
it was rather an ostentatious 
thing to do, but the fabric’s 
beautiful stuff.” 

He rubbed his nose reflectively. 
“Fact is, I’ve been hearing dis- 
turbing rumors. They say some 
fellow named Kuhak’s invented a 
ground car that can run without 
tracks.” 

Clarey almost said “Guhak,” 
but caught himself in time. “Non- 
sense,” he scoffed. “The more I 
know of them, the more surprised 
I am they ever got as far as 
inventing the chains.” 

“But they did, no getting 
around that. This is what Earth’s 
afraid of, you know,” he reminded 
Clarey — unnecessarily. “This is 
why you were sent here. And, if 
the rumor’s true, it looks as if 
you weren’t needed at all. I got 
the bad news by myself.” 

“But why should it be that up- 
setting?” Clarey tried to laugh. 
“You look as if it were the end 
of the world.” 

The colonel gave him a long, 
level look. “I consider that re- 
mark in the worst of taste.” 



Clarey stopped laughing. 

“Remember,” the colonel re- 
minded Clarey, again unneces- 
sarily, “this is the way we our- 
selves got started.” 

“But the Damorlanti don’t 
have to move in the same direc- 
tion. They may look human and 
even act human, but they don’t 
think human.” 

The colonel clasped his hands 
behind his head and sighed. 
“There have been articles against 
us in the paper, and whenever 
we go out in the street people — 
natives, I mean — make nasty 
remarks and sometimes even 
faces at us. And what have we 
done to them? Carefully minded 
our own business, avoided all cul- 
tural contacts except for trade 
purposes, paid them much more 
than the going price for their 
goods, and gave them one or two 
tips on health and sanitation. As 
a result, they’re beginning to 
hate us.” 

“But if you send a report, it’ll 
bring the staff ship in ahead of 
time. Maybe the whole thing’ll 
blow over. This way, you’re not 
giving it a chance to.” 

The colonel chewed his lip. 
“Well,” he finally said, “I might 
as well wait and see if the rumor’s 
verified before I report it.” 

^LAREY went back to Katund. 

The months went by. The 
friendly atmosphere in the Fur- 



50 



GALAXY 



bush had vanished, and not as 
many people stopped and chatted 
when they came to the library. 
But there wasn’t any actual in- 
cident until the evening Clarey 
was walking home after late night 
at the library and a stone struck 
him between the shoulder-blades. 
“Dirty Earthman!” a voice called, 
and several pairs of feet scuttled 
off. 

He didn’t mention the incident 
to Embelsira, not wanting to 
worry her, but the next morning 
he went to the Village Dome and 
informed Malesor. “Very bad,” 
the headman muttered. “Very 
bad. Whoever did it will be pun- 
ished.” 

“You won’t be able to catch 
them,” Clarey said, “and there’d 
be no point in punishment, any- 
way. Look at it like this, Mai. 
Suppose I had been an Earth- 
man, don’t you see how danger- 
ous this would be, not for me but 
for you? Can’t you imagine the 
inevitable results?” 

Malesor nodded. “The Earth- 
men’s catapults do go farther and 
faster, then?” 

“And maybe deeper,” Clarey 
agreed, pretending not to notice 
that it had been a question. “Af- 
ter the way Irik talked, I could- 
n’t help drifting over to the star- 
field when I was in Barshwat and 
watching an Earth ship come. 
You’ve no idea how incredibly 
powerful a thing it was. Anyone 



who has power in one direction 
is likely to have it in another.” 
“I wonder if the Earthmen al- 
ways had power,” Malesor 
mused, “if they weren’t like us 
once. If, given time, we couldn’t 
be like them ...” 

Clarey didn’t say anything. 
Malesor’s pale face turned 
gray “You mean we might not 
be given time?” 

Clarey wiggled his ears. “Who 
can tell what’s in the mind of an 
Earthman?” 

Malesor looked directly at 
him. “Why do you tell me this?” 
“Because I’m one of you,” 
Clarey said stoutly. 

Malesor shook his head. 
“You’re not. You never can be. 
But thanks for the warning — 
stranger.” 

Never identify, the robocoach 
had said. You’ll never be able 
to become the character yot/re 
trying to play. He was talking 
only of the stage, Clarey told 
himself angrily, as he left the 
Dome. 

Reports trickled in from the 
cities. Earthmen had been stoned 
twice in Zrig, more often than 
that in Barshwat. Clarey got an 
agitated letter from his aunt. 
“Watch out for yourself. Neph- 
ew,” she warned. “They may 
take it into their heads to attack 
all foreigners. Remember, come 
what may, you’ll always have a 
home with me.” 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



51 



Then everything broke open. A 
group of natives attacked Earth 
Headquarters in Barshwat. The 
Earthmen sprayed them with ‘a 
gas which made the attackers 
lose consciousness without harm- 
ing them; that is, it was intended 
to work that way. However, one 
of them hit his head on the wall 
when he fell, and he died the next 
day. 

The people of Vintnor were 
aroused. They milled angrily 
around Earth Headquarters car- 
rying banners that said, “Go 
home. Earth murderers!” The 
headman of Barshwat called 
upon Colonel Blynn. The colo- 
nel courteously refused to with- 
draw his men from the planet. 
“I’m under orders, old chap,” he 
said, “but I’ll report your request 
back to Earth.” 

“It isn’t a request,” the head- 
man said. 

Colonel Blynn smiled and said, 
“We’ll treat it as one, shall we?” 

Clarey knew what happened, 
because the headman gave a re- 
port of the conversation to the 
Barshwat Prime Bulletin. He also 
got a letter from his aunt de- 
scribing the incident as vividly 
as if she had been there herself. 
The Barshwat Prime ran a 
series of increasingly intemper- 
ate editorials calling upon all 
the nations of Damorlan to 
unite against the Earthmen; it 
was spirit that counted, it said. 



rather than technology. Malesor 
wrote a letter asking how su- 
perior spiritual values could 
compete against presumably su- 
perior weapons. He read it aloud 
in the Purple Furbush before he 
sent it to the editor of the Bar- 
shwat Prime, which was lucky, 
because the Prime never printed 
it, although the Dordonec Bul- 
letin ran a copy. 

TTOWEVER, the Barshwat 
Prime did print letters from 
editors in different countries. All 
of them pledged firm moral sup- 
port. It also printed a letter from 
an anonymous correspondent in 
Katund which alleged that there 
was an Earth spy in that village, 
disguised as a Damorlant, and 
it was this spy who was person- 
ally responsible for the decline 
of musical taste on the whole 
planet. But the Bulletin seemed 
to consider this merely as an 
emanation from the lunatic 
fringe: “It would be as easy to 
disguise a hix as one of us as an 
Earthman. And, although we 
could certainly not minimize the 
importance of music in our cul- 
ture, it is hardly likely that 
Earth would be attempting to 
achieve fell purposes through un- 
dermining that art. No, the de- 
cline in musical taste represents 
part of the general decline in 
public morality which has left 
us an easy prey.”

Irik went back to Barshwat to 
help riot, but he left the Katundi 
convinced that Clarey was, if not 
actually an Earthman, at least 
a traitor. When he came into the 
Furbush, everybody got up and 
left. Nobody patronized the 
branch library any more. The 
constant readers went to the main 
library at Zrig, and, since the 
trip was expensive, their books 
were usually overdue and they 
had to pay substantial fines. 
Sometimes they never returned 
the books at all and messengers 
had to be sent from the city. 
Finally the chief librarian at 
Zrig issued a regulation that only 
those resident within the city 
limits could take books out; all 
others in the district had to read 
them on the premises. The Ka- 
tundi blamed that on Clarey, too. 
One night they broke into his 
library and stole all the best- 
sellers. 

A couple of days later, he 
came home and found all the 
windows of his dome broken. 
Best-sellers are often disappoint- 
ing, he thought. He found a note 
from Embelsira, saying, “I have 
gone home to Mother.” 

He knew she expected him to 
go after her, but he wrote her a 
note saying he was going to see 
his aunt who was terrified by all 
the riots, and put it in the mail, 
so she wouldn’t get it too soon. 
He packed his kit with his most 

SENTRY OF THE SKY 



important possessions and he 
took his ulerin under his arm. 

When he reached Barshwat, he 
had some difficulty getting 
through the crowd in front of 
Earth Headquarters. All the 
windows were boarded up 
and the garbage hadn’t been col- 
lected for a considerable length 
of time. Just as he reached the 
door, a familiar voice called, 
“That’s the Earth spy!” 

“Don’t be silly!” another voice 
said. “He’s obviously one of us!” 
“But a traitor!” cried another 
voice. “Otherwise why go in 
there?” Stones splattered against 
the door, followed by impartial 
cries of “Spy!' . Traitor! 

. Fool!” the last seemingly ad- 
dressed to each other, rather than 
Clarey. 

Blynn was haggard and anx- 
ious-looking “I’ve been wondering 
when you’d show up. Afraid 
maybe they’d got you — ” 

“I’m all right,” Clarey inter- 
rupted. “But what are we going 
to do?” 

Blynn laughed without stop>- 
ping for a full minute. “Do? I’ll 
tell you what 'we’re going to do. 
We’re going to sit tight and wait 
for the staff ship.” 

Two months later the staff 
ship came. Blynn radioed for the 
general and the secretary to come 
in a closed ground car. 

“But why?” the general’s voice 
crackled plaintively over the 



53 



corn-unit. “I thought we didn’t 
want them to know about ground 
cars — ” 

“They know,” Blynn said 
crisply. “They’ve got one of 
their own now, maybe more. 
Crazy-looking thing, but it works. 
You’ll see it outside Headquarters 
when you get here. The letters 
on the side mean ‘Earthmen, 
Go!’ Form imperative impolite 
emphatic.” 

Han Vollard strode into Head- 
quarters, eyes ablaze. “Why 
didn’t you send a report before 
trouble started? How could you 
allow an emergency situation to 
happen?” 

Neither Blynn nor Carey said 
anything. 

“Very distressing thing,.” Spano 
declared. “Maybe it hit them so 
suddenly they didn’t know it was 
building.” 

“You and Blynn get over to 
the ship right away for deep- 
probing,” Han Vollard ordered, as 
both began to speak at once. 
“It’s the only way I’ll be able to 
get a coherent report.” 

After the results came through, 
her anger was cold, searing, un- 
womanly. “You knew a year ago 
that things were beginning to go 
wrong and you didn’t even men- 
tion it on the tapes! I could have 
both of you broken for this.” 

“If only that were all there was 
to worry about,” Clarey sighed 
wistfully. 




54 



CHE WHIRLED on him. “Stop 
^ feeling sorry for yourself!” 
The sudden loss of control in 
that dark amazon was more 
threatening than anything that 
had happened yet. 

“I’m not feeling sorry for my- 
self,” he said. “It’s the Damor- 
lanti I feel sorry for.” 

“You feel sorry for them be- 
cause you identify with them. 
That makes you sorry for your- 
self.” 

She misunderstood his motives 
as she misunderstood everything 
he did or said, but their rapport 
wasn’t at stake now. “What are 
you going to do?” he forced him- 
self to ask. 

“The decision will have to be 
made on Earth. Unless you mean 
what’s going to happen to you? 
That’s simple — you’ll go back 
with us. Blynn will stay here, 
pending orders.” 

The colonel saluted. 

“But I thought I was going to 
stay here ten years,” said Clarey. 

“Five to ten years,” she cor- 
rected. “Apparently five was 
enough — ” She cut herself short. 
“What’s the matter with me?” 
she suddenly exclaimed. “I’ve 
been letting myself think in the 
same woolly way you do.” 

Suddenly, almost frighteningly, 
she smiled. “Clarey, you did the 
job we sent you out to do! You 
did it better than we expected! 
What threw me off was that we 



sent you out to act as an observer. 
Instead, you became a catalyst!” 

She seized his hand and wrung 
it warmly. “Clarey, I apologize. 
You’ve done a splendid job!” 

He wrenched his hand from 
her grasp. “I didn’t act as a 
catalyst! It would have happened 
anyway.” His voice rang in his 
own horrified ears — a voice 
begging for reassurance. 

And she was a woman; she 
had maternal instincts; she re- 
assured him. “It would have hap- 
pened anyway,” she said sooth- 
ingly, “but it would have dragged 
on for years, cost the taxpayers 
billions.” 

“And now,” he whispered, still 
unable to believe that the thing 
had really happened, “will you . 
dispose of everyone on Damor- 
lant?” 

She smiled and threw herself 
into a chair, her body limp and 
tired and contended-looking. 
“Come, Clarey, we’re not that 
ruthless. Some kind of quarantine 
will probably be worked out. We 
just made the whole thing sound 
more drastic to appeal to your 
patriotism.” 

The general beamed. “So 
everything has worked out all 
right, after all? I knew it would. 
I always had the utmost con- 
fidence in you, Clarey.” 

She was busily planning. “We’ll 
arrange some kind of heroic ac- 
cident ... I have it! You died 



56 



GALAXY 






saving your aunt from the 
flames.” 

“What flames?” 

“The flames of the fire that 
burned down her house. She died 
of the local equivalent of shock. 
Embelsira will be rich, so she’ll 
want to believe the story. She’ll 
be able to find herself another 
husband; she’ll have children. 
She’ll be better off, Clarey.” 

He looked at her, his misery 
welling out of his eyes. 

“Oh, I don’t mean it that way, 
man! All I meant was that you’re 
a human being; she’s not. I’m not 
saying one is better than the 
other. I’m saying they’re differ- 
ent.” 

“But I felt less different with 
her, with the Damorlanti, than 
with anyone on Earth,” he said. 

She walked across to the win- 
dow and looked out at the 
Damorlanti rioting ineptly be- 
low. “Most of us are happier 
in our dream world,” she said at 
last, “but society couldn’t func- 
tion if we were allowed to stay 
there.” 

“Damorlan wasn’t a dream 
world.” 

“But it will be,” she said. 

A ND SO Clarey went back to 
Earth on the staff ship. Once 
its luxury would have given him 
pleasure; now the cabin with its 
taps that gave out plain water, 
salt water, mineral water, and 



assorted cordials held no charm; 
neither did the self-contained 
tri-di projector-receiver. The only 
reason he stayed there most of 
the time was to avoid the others. 
However, he couldn’t avoid turn- 
ing up in the dining salon for 
meals. The greater his sorrow, 
the greater his appetite. 

One day after lunch, Han stop- 
ped him forcibly, grasping his 
arm. “I’ve got to talk to you. 
Afterward you can go off and sulk 
if you want to. But we’re going 
to make planetfall in a few days. 
It’s necessary to discuss your 
future now.” 

“I have no future,” he said. 

“Come this way, Clarey. That’s 
an order!” 

Obediently, he followed her 
into a lounge that was a dazzle 
of color and splendor. There were 
eight pseudo-windows, each fram- 
ing a pseudo-scene of a different 
planet at a different season. The 
harsh, barren summer of Mars, 
the cold, bleak winter of Ksud, 
the gentle green spring of Earth 
... It must be a park, he knew; 
in no other place on Earth could 
spring be manifest — and yet it 
gave him a little pang to look 
at it. He tore his eyes away to 
turn them toward the others, and 
then up at the domed ceiling, 
fashioned to resemble a blue sky 
with clouds drifting across it. A 
domed ceiling . and he thought 
of the domes of Damorlan, light- 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



57 



years away among the stars . 

“I’m afraid the decor’s a bit 
gaudy,” Han apologized. “We 
didn’t check the decorator’s past 
performance until it was too late. 
But it’s comfortable, anyway. 
Try one of these chairs. They 
accommodate themselves to the 
form.” 

She threw herself on a chaise 
lounge that accommodated itself 
perfectly to her form. She wasn’t 
wearing her usual opulent secre- 
tarial garb, but something simple 
of clinging stuff that occasionally 
went transparent. So we’re back 
to the first movement, Clarey 
though wearily. 

He made sure that the chair 
opposite her was old-style before 
he lowered himself into it. 
“Where’s the general? I thought 
he always sat in on these con- 
ferences.” 

“The formalities are over 
now,” she said, smiling up at 
him. “Besides,” she added, “if he 
doesn’t take a nap after lunch, it 
wreaks havoc with his digestion. 
Afraid to be alone with me, 
Clarey?” she asked huskily. 

“Yes,” he said, rising, “as a 
matter of fact, I am, now that 
you mention it.” 

She sat up. “Sit down!” 

He sat down. 

She didn’t recline again. Her 
dress went opaque, but her voice 
grew silken once more. “Listen, 
Clarey, I don’t want you to think 



we’re cheating you out of any-; I 
thing we promised. Even though 
you stayed only five years, you’re i 
going to have it all. You’ll have | 
U-E status — ” ? 

“What do I want that for?” | 
“Doesn’t it mean anything to { 
you any more, Clarey? It used to ! 
mean a lot, though you denied | 
it even to yourself.” 

“Did it?” He forced his 
thoughts back through time. “I 
suppose it did. But I’ve changed. 
You know, those five years on 
Damorlan seem like — ” 

“Like a lifetime,” she finished. 
“Couldn’t we dispense with the ) 
cliches?” j 

“On Damorlan the things I said I 
were fresh and interesting. On | 
Damorlan I was somebody pretty j 
special. I’d rather be a big { 
second-hand fish in a small prim- j 
itive puddle. Isn’t there some 1 
way — ” 

“No way at all, Clarey! The 
puddle’s drying up. We’ve got a 
nice aquarium ready for you. 
Why not dive in gracefully?” 

“It was my puddle,” he said, a 
“I belonged.” 

^HE CLOSED her eyes and 
^ sank back into the chair which - 
arched to meet the arch of her 
body. Lying down, she didn’t look 
nearly as tall. “All right, let’s 
give the whole opera one final ‘ 
run-through. Nobody cared for i 
you on Earth; on Damorlan your

friends liked you; your wife loved 
you. On Earth you never felt 
welcome and/or appreciated; on 
Damorlan you felt both welcome 
and appreciated. On Earth — ” 
He was stung out of his apathy. 
“That’s right! I’m not saying I’m 
unique, only that I fitted — ” 
“How about trying to look at 
it from another point of view? 
Did it ever occur to you that, if 
the Damorlanti accepted you, so 
might your own people, if you 
approached them in the same 
way? Did you ever try to make 
friends on Earth?” 

“But on Earth I shouldn’t have 
to. They were my own people.” 
“Aha!” she cried gleefully. 

“I mean — well. General 
Spano said it would be wrong to 
stoop to hypocrisy to win the 
friendship of my own people; 
that, if I did, their friendship 
wouldn’t be worth anything. You 
can’t buy friendship.” 

“You bought your ulerin. Does 
it play any the worse because you 
paid for it? Does it mean any the 
less to you?” 

“What you’re getting at,” he 
said cautiously, “is that that’s the 
way to make friends? By being 
a hypocrite?” 

“Was it a sham with the Dam- 
orlanti?” 

He had to stop for a moment 
before he could bring out an 
answer. “It started out as a sham 
— but I really got to like them 



afterward. Then it was real.” 
“So then you weren’t a hypo- 
crite, Clarey.” Her voice grew 
more resonant. “Open yourself to 
people, show them that you want 
to be friends. Basically, every- 
body’s shy and timid inside.” 
“Like you?” he said, casting an 
ironical glance at her dress. 

“That’s still the outside,” she 
smiled, making, no move to ad- 
just it. “Listen to me, Clarey, and 
don’t go off on sidetracks: The 
people of Earth are your own 
people. Your loyalties have al- 
ways been with them.” 

She had almost had him con- 
vinced, but this he couldn’t 
swallow. “If my loyalties had 
been with Earth, I would have 
sent back reports of the trouble. 
But I didn’t. I tried to stop it 
from happening. There just 
wasn’t anything I could do.” 

“The deep-probe never lies, 
Clarey. You didn’t really try to 
stop it.” She paused, and then 
went on deliberately: “Because 
you could have stopped it, you 
know quite easily.” 

. “There was nothing I could 
have done,” he stated. “Nothing.” 
“Remember the first time the 
staff ship came? Just before you 
left for Barshwat, the woman told 
you she suspected you were an 
Earthman. You were afraid for 
her. Do you remember that?” 

He nodded. Yes, he remem- 
bered how terrified he had been 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



59 



then, how relieved afterward, 
thinking everything was going to 
be all right. Lucky he hadn’t 
realized the truth, or he wouldn’t 
have had those extra years of 
happiness. 

¥TAN WENT on remorselessly: 
“And you thought if only 
something would happen to you 
en route, she would be safe. We 
might guess why it had happened, 
but we couldn’t know for sure. 
We’d have had to start all over 
again.” 

He couldn’t move, couldn’t 
speak, couldn’t think. She spaced 
each word carefully, sweetly. 
“You were quite right. Because 
you were the only man on Earth, 
Clarey, who had the particular 
physical requirements and the 
particular kind of mental insta- 
bility that we needed for the job. 
You just said you weren’t unique, 
Clarey. You were too modest; 
you are. If you’d killed yourself 
then, your death would have 
served a purpose; you would have 
died a hero. Kill yourself now 
and you die a coward.” 

“But at least I’d be dead. I 
wouldn’t have to live with a 
coward for the rest of my life.” 

“You’re not a coward, Clarey,” 
she said. “You wouldn’t admit it, 
but you are and always have been 
a patriot. To you. Earth came 
first. It’s as simple as that.” 

She had deep-probed his mind. 



She must know his true feelings. 
There was no gainsaying that. He 
could know only his surface 
thoughts; she knew what lay be- 
hind and beneath. And, he re- 
minded himself, at the end the 
Damorlanti were actually turn- 
ing on him. 

“Try to think of the whole 
thing as a course in charm that 
you’ve passed with flying colors,” 
she said. 

“It seems rather an expensive 
way of making me charming,” he 
couldn’t help saying, with the last 
struggle of something that was 
dying in him, something alien 
that perhaps should never have 
been there in the first place. 

“Whole civilizations have been 
sacrificed for nothing at all. This 
one will not be sacrificed, only 
quarantined. But its contribution 
could be of cosmic magnitude.” 

“Now what are you going to 
try to sell me?” he asked drearily. 
“Are you saying that the essence 
of the Damorlant civilization is 
going to live on in me, that I 
carry its heritage inside myself, 
and so I have a tremendous re- 
sponsibility to the Damorlanti on 
my shoulders?” 

She laughed. “You’re really 
getting sharp, Clarey. If you 
stayed in the service, you could 
be one of our best operatives. But 
you’re not going to stay in the 
service. Yours is a higher destiny. 
Here, catch!”

She tossed him something that 
glittered as it arched through the 
air. 

It was a U-E identcube, made 
out in his name. He had only seen 
them at a distance, and now he 
was holding one warm and 
gleaming in his hand, with his 
name and his face in it. His face 
. and yet not his face. 
“That’s what you’re going to 
look like when the plasto- 
surgeons get through,” she ex- 
plained. “They’ll pigment your 
eyes and skin and hair, and they 
may be able to add a few inches 
to your height. Though I think 
you actually have grown a little. 
Something about the air, or, more 
likely, the food.” 

“Embelsira thought I was 
handsome the way I was. Em- 
belsira . .” But Embelsira was 
light-years away. Embelsira was 
part of a fading dream — and 
he was awakening now to reality. 

“Look at the cube. Look at 
your status symbol.” 

He looked at it, and he kept on 
looking at it. He couldn’t tear 
his eyes away. He was hypnotized 
by the golden glitter of it, the 
golden meaning of it. “Musician,” 
he said aloud. “Musician. ...” A 
dream word, a magic word. He 
hadn’t thought of it for years, 
but this he didn’t have to reach 
back for. Once touched on, it 
surged over him, complete with 
its memories. 



T>UT SHE had made it mean- 
ingless, too. He managed to 
tear a laugh out of his throat. 
“Spano said I’d be able to buy 
the Musicians’ Guild when I had 
my million and a half. Apparently 
you’ve been able to bargain them 
down.” 

“This cost nothing except the 
standard initiation fee,” she told 
him. “You came by it honestly 

— through your music, nothing 
else. And you have more than a 
million and a half credits, Clarey 

— nearly ten times that, with 
more pouring iii' every day.” 

She touched a boss on the side 
of her chair and white light hazed 
around them. “I think we’re close 
enough to Earth to get some of 
the high-power tri-dis,” she said, 
“although we can’t expect perfect 
reception.” 

Blurrily, a show formed — a 
variety show. At first it seemed 
the same sort of thing that he 
remembered dimly, more interest- 
ing now because it had almost 
the character of novelty. Then an 
ornate young man appeared and 
it took deeper significance. He 
was carrying a musical instru- 
ment — refined, machined, care- 
fully pitched. He played music 
on the ulerin while a trio sang 
insipid Terrestrial words. “Love 
Is a Guiding Star” they called it, 
but that didn’t matter. It was 
one of the tunes Clarey had 
taped. 



SENTRY OF THE SKY 



61 



She touched another boss. The 
blur reformed to a symphony 
orchestra, playing as background 
music to a soloist with another 
ulerin. “That’s your First Ulerin 
Concerto,” she said. “There are 
three more.” 

Another program was begin- 
ning, an account of the tribula- 
tions of an unfortunate Plutonian 
family. It faded in to the strains 
of ulerin music, to a tune of 
Clarey’s. If they could have en- 
dured it to the end, she told him, 
it would have faded out the same 
way. “Every time they play it,” 
she said, “somewhere on Earth 
a cash register rings for you. And 
this one’s a daily program.” 

He watched transfixed and 
transfigured as program after 
program featured his music, his 
ulerin. 

“Not just on Earth,” Han said, 
“but on all the civilized planets, 
even in a few of the more so- 
phisticated primitive ones. Y ou’re 
a famous man, Clarey. Earth is 
waiting for you, literally and 
figuratively. There’ll be ulerin 
orchestras to greet you at the 
field; we sent a relay ahead to let 
them know you were coming.” 

But his mind was slowly alert- 
ing itself. “And where am I sup- 
posed to be coming from, then, 
since they’re never to hear about 
Damorlan?” 

“They’ve been told that you 
retired to a lonely asteroid to 



work — to perfect your art and 
its instrument.” 

Of course they couldn’t divulge 
the truth about Damorlan. “It 
seems a little unfair, though,” he 
said. 

“Why unfair? After all, Cla- 
rey, the music is yours. You 
took Damorlan’s melodies and 
made them into music. You took 
their ulerin and made it into a 
musical instrument. They’re all 
yours, every note and bladder 
of them.” 

She reached over and put out 
a hand to him. “And I’m yours, 
too, Clarey, if you want me,” she 
breathed. There was obviously 
no doubt in her mind that he 
did want her. And in his, too. 
One didn’t reject the Secretary 
of Space. 

He took the chilly hand in his. 
The skin was odd in texture. I’m 
imagining things, he thought. It’s 
a long time since I touched a 
human female’s hand. 

“I must be a very important 
Musician,” he said aloud. 

QHE NODDED, not pretend- 
^ ing to misunderstand. “Yes, 
important enough to rate the 
original and not a reasonable 
facsimile. You’re a lucky man, 
Clarey.” And then she smiled up 
at him. “I can be warm and 
tender, I assure you.” 

It took him a moment to re- 
alize what she meant. For a 



62 



GALAXY 



moment he had that pang again. 
She would never be the same as 
Embelsira, but a man needed 
change to develop. 

He was still troubled, though. 
“I want to do something. Even 
an empty gesture’s better than 
none at all. The last few months, 
I started putting together a 
longer thing; I guess it could be 
a symphony. When I finish it. 
I’d like to call it the ‘Damorlant 
Symphony.’ ” 

“Why not?” she said. He 
thought she was humoring him, 
but she added, “They’ll think 
you just picked the name from 
an astrogation chart.” 

In a final burst of irony he 
dedicated the “Damorlant Sym- 
phony” to the human race, but, 
as usual, he was misunderstood. 
In fact, one of the music critics 
— all of whom were enthusi- 
astic over the new work — 
wrote, “At last we have a great 
musician who is also a great 
humanist.” 

Eventually Clarey forgot his 
original intent and came to be- 
lieve it himself.

for his 

other star — and this miserable 
contraption bucked right backl 



By KEITH LAUMER 
Illustrated by RITTER 



S TEADYING his elbow on 
the kitchen table serving 
as desk, Brigadier General 
Straut leveled his binoculars and 
stared out through the second- 
floor window of the farmhouse 
at the bulky object lying canted 
at the edge of the wood lot. He 
watched the figures moving over 
around the gray mass, then 
flipped the lever on the field 
telephone at his elbow. 



“How are your boys doing, 
Major?” 

“General, since that box this 
morning — ” 

“I know all about the box. Bill. 
So does Washington by now. 
What have you got that’s new?” 

“Sir, I haven’t got anything to 
report yet. I have four crews on 
it, and she still looks impervious 
as hell.” 

“Still getting the sounds from 
inside?” 

“Intermittently, General.” 

“I’m giving you one more hour. 
Major. I want that thing 
cracked.” 

The general dropped the 
phone back on its cradle and 
peeled the cellophane from a 
cigar absently. He had moved 
fast, he reflected, after the State 
Police notified him at nine forty- 
one last night. He had his men 
on the spot, the area evacuated 
of civilians, and a preliminary 
report on its way to Washington 
by midnight. At two thirty-six, 
they had discovered the four- 
inch cube lying on the ground 
fifteen feet from the huge object 
— missile, capsule, bomb — 
whatever it was. But now — 
several hours later — nothing 
new. 

The field phone jangled. Straut 
grabbed it up. 

“General, we’ve discovered a 
thin spot up on the top side. All 



we can tell so far is that the wall 
thickness falls off there . .” 

“Air right. Keep after it. Bill.” 

This was more like it. If Briga- 
dier General Straut could have 
this thing wrapped up by the 
time Washington awoke to the 
fact that it was something big — 
well, he’d been waiting a long 
time for that second star. This 
was his chance, and he would 
damn well make the most of 
it. 

TTE looked across the field at 
the thing. It was half in and 
half out of the woods, flat-sided, 
round-ended, featureless. Maybe 
he should go over and give it a 
closer look personally. He might 
spot something the others were 
missing. It might blow them all 
to kingdom come any second; 
but what the hell, he had earned 
his star on sheer guts in Norman- 
dy. He still had ’em. 

He keyed the phone. “I’m com- 
ing down. Bill,” he told the Ma- 
jor. On impulse, he strapped a 
pistol belt on. Not much use 
against a house-sized bomb, but 
the heft of it felt good. 

The thing looked bigger than 
ever as the jeep approached it, 
bumping across the muck of the 
freshly plowed field. From here 
he could see a faint line running 
around, just below the juncture 
of side and top.^ Major Greer

hadn’t mentioned that. The line 
was quite obvious; in fact, it was 
more of a crack. 

With a sound like a baseball 
smacking the catcher’s glove, the 
crack opened, the upper half til- 
ted, men sliding — then impos- 
sibly it stood open, vibrating, like 
the roof of a house suddenly 
lifted. The driver gunned the 
jeep. There were cries, and a 
ragged shrilling that set Straut’s 
teeth on edge. The men were 
running back now, two of them 
dragging a third. 

Major Greer emerged from be- 
hind the object, looked about, 
ran toward General Straut shout- 
ing. “ a man dead. It snap- 
ped; we weren’t expecting it . .” 

Straut jumped out beside the 
men, who had stopped now and 
were looking back. The under- 
side of the gaping lid was an ir- 
idescent black. The shrill noise 
sounded thinly across the field. 
Greer arrived, panting. 

“What happened?” Straut 
snapped. 

“I was ... checking over that 
thin spot. General. The first thing 
I knew it was . coming up 
under me. I fell; Tate was at the 
other side. He held on and it 
snapped him loose, against a tree. 
His skull — ” 

“What the devil’s that racket?” 

“That’s the sound we were 
getting from inside before. Gen- 



eral. There’s something in there, 
alive — ” 

“All right, pull yourself to- 
gether, Major. We’re not unpre- 
pared. Bring your half-tracks into 
position. The tanks will be here 
soon.” 

Straut glanced at the men 
standing about. He would show 
them what leadership meant. 

“You men keep back,” he said. 
He puffed his cigar calmly as he 
walked toward the looming ob- 
ject. The noise stopped sudden- 
ly; that was a relief. There was 
a faint and curious odor in the 
air, something like chlorine . 
or seaweed ... or iodine. 

There were no marks in the 
ground surrounding the thing. It 
had apparently dropped straight 
in to its present position. It was 
heavy, too — the soft soil was 
displaced m a mound a foot high 
all along the side. 

Behind him, Straut heard a 
yell. He whirled. The men were 
pointing; the jeep started up, 
churned toward him, wheels spin- 
ning. He looked up. Over the 
edge of the gray wall, six feet 
above his head, a great reddish 
limb, like the claw of a crab, 
moved, groping. 

Straut yanked the .45 from 
its holster, jacked the action and 
fired. Soft matter spattered, and 
the claw jerked back. The 
screeching started up again an- 
grily, then was drowned in the

engine roar as the jeep slid to 
a stop. 

Straut stooped, grabbed up a 
leaf to which a quivering lump 
adhered, jumped into the vehicle 
as it leaped forward; then a shock 
and they were going into a spin 
and . 

i6T UCKY it was soft ground,” 
-■-^somebody said. And some- 
body else asked, “What about the 
driver?” 

Silence. Straut opened his 
eyes. “What . about . .” 

A stranger was looking down 
at him, an ordinary-looking fel- 
low of about thirty-five. 

“Easy, now. General Straut. 
You’ve had a bad spill. Every- 
thing is all right. I’m Professor 
Lieberman, from the University.” 
“The driver,” Straut said with 
an effort. 

“He was killed when the jeep 
went over.” 

“Went . over?” 

“The creature lashed out with 
a member resembling a scorpion’s 
stinger. It struck the jeep and 
flipped it. You were thrown clear. 
The driver jumped and the jeep 
rolled on him.” 

Straut pushed himself up. 
“Where’s Greer?” 

“I’m right here, sir.” Major 
Greer stepped up, stood atten- 
tively. 

“Those tanks here yet?” 

“No, sir. I had a call from 



General Margrave; there’s some 
sort of holdup. Something about 
not destroying scientific mate- 
rial. I did get the mortars over 
from the base.” 

Straut got to his feet. The 
stranger took his arm. “You 
ought to lie down. General — ” 

“Who the hell is going to make 
me? Greer, get those mortars in 
place, spaced between your 
tracks.” 

The telephone rang. Straut 
seized it. “General Straut.” 

“General Margrave here, 
Straut. I’m glad you’re back on 
your feet. There’ll be some sci- 
entists from the State Univer- 
sity coming over. Cooperate with 
them. You’re going to have to 
hold things together at least until 
I can get another man in there 
to — ” 

“Another man? General Mar- 
grave, I’m not incapacitated. The 
situation is under complete con- 
trol — ” 

“It is, is it? I understand you’ve 
got still another casualty. What’s 
happened to your defensive ca- 
pabilities?” 

“That was an accident, sir. The 
jeep — ” 

“We’ll review that matter at a 
later date. What I’m calling 
about is more important right 
now. The code men have made 
some headway on that box of 
yours. It’s putting out a sort of 
transmission.” 



DOORSTEP

“What kind, sir?” 

“Half the message — it’s only 
twenty seconds long, repeated — 
is in English. It’s a fragment of a 
recording from a daytime radio 
program; one of the network men 
here identified it. The rest is gib- 
berish. They’re still working over 
it.” 

“What — ” 

“Bryant tells me he thinks 
there may be some sort of cor- 
respondence between the two 
parts of the message. I wouldn’t 
know, myself. In my opinion, it’s 
a threat of some sort.” 

“I agree. General. An ultima- 
tum.” 

“Right. Keep your men back 
at a safe distance from now on. 
I want no more casualities.” 

S TRAUT cursed his luck as he 
hung up the phone. Margrave 
was ready to relieve him, after 
he had exercised every precau- 
tion. He had to do something 
fast, before this opportunity for 
promotion slipped out of. his 
hands. 

He looked at Major Greer. 
“I’m neutralizing this thing once 
and for all. There’ll be no more 
men killed.” 

Lieberman stood up. “General! 
I must protest any attack against 
this—” 

Straut whirled. “I’m handling 
this. Professor. I don’t know who 



let you in here or why but 
I’ll make the decisions. I’m stop- 
ping this man-killer before it 
comes out of its nest, maybe gets 
into that village beyond the 
woods. There are four thousand 
civilians there. It’s my job to 
protect them.” He jerked his 
head at Greer, strode out of the 
room. 

Lieberman followed, pleading. 
“The creature has shown no 
signs of aggressiveness. General 
Straut — ” 

“With two men dead?” 

“You should have kept them 
back — ” 

“Oh, it was my fault, was it?” 
Straut stared at Lieberman with 
cold fury. This civilian pushed 
his way in here, then had the in- 
fernal gall to accuse him. Briga- 
dier General Straut, of causing 
the death of his own men. If he 
had the fellow in uniform for five 
minutes . 

“You’re not well, General. 
That fall — ” 

“Keep out of my way. Pro- 
fessor,” Straut said. He turned 
and went on down the stairs. 
The present foul-up could ruin 
his career; and now this egghead 
interference . 

With Greer at his side, Straut 
moved out to the edge of the 
field. 

“All right. Major. Open up 
with your .50 calibers.” 



Greer called a command and a 
staccato rattle started up. The 
smell of cordite and the blue 
haze of gunsmoke — this was 
more like it. He was in command 
here. 

Lieberman came up to Straut. 
“General, I appeal to you in the 
name of science. Hold off a little 
longer; at least until we learn 
what the message is about.” 

“Get back from the firing line. 
Professor.” Straut turned his back 
on the civilian, raised the glasses 
to observe the effect of the re- 
coilless rifle. There was a tre- 
mendous smack of displaced air, 
and a thunderous boom as the 
explosive shell struck. Straut saw 
the gray shape jump, the raised 
lid waver. Dust rose from about 
it. There was no other effect. 

“Keep firing, Greer,” Straut 
snapped, almost with a feeling 
of triumph. The thing was im- 
pervious to artillery; now who 
was going to say it was no threat? 

“How about the mortars, sir?” 
Greer said. “We can drop a few 
rounds right inside it.” 

“All right, try that before the 
lid drops.” 

And what we’ll try next, I 
don’t know, he thought. 

^T^HE mortar fired with a muf- 
fled thud. Straut watched 
tensely. Five seconds later, the 
object erupted in a gout of pale 
pink debris. The lid rocked, pink- . 



ish fluid running down its opal- 
escent surface. A second burst, 
and a third. A great fragment of 
the menacing claw hung from the 
branch of a tree a hundred feet 
from the ship. 

Straut grabbed up the phone. 
“Cease fire!” 

Lieberman stared in horror at 
the carnage. 

The telephone rang. Straut 
picked it up. 

“General Straut,” he said. His 
voice was firm. He had put an 
end to the threat. 

“Straut, we’ve broken the mes- 
sage,” General Margrave said ex- 
citedly. “It’s the damnedest thing 
I ever . .” 

Straut wanted to interrupt, an- 
nounce his victory, but Margrave 
was droning on. 

“. strange sort of reasoning, 
but there was a certain analogy. 
In any event, I’m assured the 
translation is accurate. Here’s 
how it reads in English . .” 

Straut listened. Then he care- 
fully placed the receiver back on 
the hook. 

Lieberman stared at him. 

“What did it say?” 

Straut cleared his throat. He 
turned and looked at Lieberman 
for a long moment before an- 
swering. 

“It said, ‘Please take good care 
of my little girl.’ ”

LET’S DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE WEATHER. 

J UST seventy years ago 
General Robert Dyrenforth 
traveled from Washington, 
D. C., to Texas to spend nearly 
$9,000 on gunpowder and high 
explosives. He was not heading 
a military expedition of some 
kind and the powder and explo- 
sives were not expended against 
outlaws, Indians or Mexicans. 
This was research for which 
Congress had appropriated the 
sum mentioned. General Dyren-

forth by that time was no longer 
an active military man but repre- 
sented the Department of Agri- 
culture. And the explosions were 
set off to influence the weather, 
to cause rain if it could be done. 
It was the first instance of large- 
scale research on weather control. 

Did it work? 

It did rain occasionally after 
a few barrels of gunpowder had 
been set off. But if some Texan 
who stood around and watched 
the activities claimed that it 
would have rained anyway, there 
wasn’t much General Dyrenforth 
or anybody else could say in 
reply. The increase in rainfall 
was not decisive. 

The whole experiment had 
been an outgrowth of a story, 
revived by the Civil War, that 
had started in Europe a century 
01 so earlier. Veterans of' the 
Seven Years’ War told anybody 
willing to listen how every big 
battle had been followed by a 
downpour. After the Napoleonic 
wars the story was revived, and 
again after the Civil War in the 
Western Hemisphere. 

By 1869 an American engineer 
by the name of Powers decided 
to collect all stories of this kind 
— of course not all the stories 
were purely military; some of 
them related to rains following 
the accidental explosion of 
powder magazines — and to 
check on their accuracy as far 



as this could be done. Powers was 
so convinced that the stories 
were accurate that he titled his 
book War and Weather. It ap- 
peared in 1871 and was the ulti- 
mate reason for the appropriation 
of $9,000 to the Department of 
Agriculture. 

I 3 OWERS’ book was not the 
first work to say that human 
activities, voluntary and invol- 
untary, influenced the weather. In 
1841 another American, James 
Pollard Espy, had published a 
book with the title Philosophy of 
Storms. In this book he explained 
that rainfall was often caused by 
large fires, as for example forest 
fires. He reasoned that the air 
heated by the fire would rise, 
other air had to rush in laterally, 
and a fire which lasted for some 
time would therefore produce 
convection currents leading to 
the formation of cumulus clouds 
from which it would rain. It 
should be said right now that 
this does happen, but not every 
time. 

The adherents of the “gun- 
powder theory” did not claim 
that explosions caused the clouds 
but felt that the shock waves 
caused by the explosions induced 
the clouds to shed their moisture. 
At a later date this theory was 
somewhat amended by saying 
that the solid particles released 
into the atmosphere in the form

of smoke acted as “condensation 
kernels” on which the water 
vapor of the clouds could con- 
dense. 

Parallel with the belief that 
the gunfire of a battle caused 
rain to fall, another belief grew 
up which does not seem to have 
made its way to the New World 
and which cannot be traced in 
detail even in Europe, where it 
was confined to the countries to 
the north of the Alps. That was 
the belief that shooting, even if 
it did not produce rain, at least 
would prevent hail. Many town- 
ships, especially in agricultural 
regions, bought cannon and held 
them ready to fire oversized 
charges but without projectiles 
whenever a cloud which looked 
as if it might ruin the crops with 
hail appeared in the sky. Whether 
it actually did any good is 
doubted by all meteorologists, but 
at the time it certainly looked as 
if it were effective. In the first 
place, not every black cloud is a 
hail cloud. In the second place, 
the hail cloud might sail on, and 
who cared about hail in the next 
region? In the meantime the hail 
cannon got all the credit. 

To return to scientific reason- 
ing: during the period from, say, 
1875 to 1890, it was realized that 
some cooling effects in the clouds 
must have had something to do 
with the onset of precipitation. 
Well, if such was the case it 



might be possible to help the cool- 
ing along. Somebody by the 
name of Louis Gathmann is on 
record as having been the first 
man to suggest (in 1891) shoot- 
ing liquid carbon dioxide into re- 
luctant rain clouds. 

^T^HERE are scattered records 
of some early experiments 
with what we now call “cloud 
seeding” performed prior to the 
First World War. Each and 
every one of these experiments 
seems to have been severely un- 
derfinanced and none of them 
was conclusive. Besides, the expe- 
rimenters did not yet know the 
necessary details; modern cloud 
seeding looks for clouds which 
are already supercooled and just 
tries to trigger them. The early 
experimenters apparently tried 
to make clouds by cooling the air 
with their carbon dioxide or 
liquid air. It isn’t completely im- 
possible that this may be made to 
work, but it would require enor- 
mous quantities of cooling agents, 
and if it could be made to work, 
it certainly would not pay. 

The first modern experiments 
along those lines were performed 
in 1930 in Holland by Augustus 
W. Veraart and they do sound 
“modern.” To begin with, he used 
an airplane. And he seeded clouds 
with “dry ice” and with a mixture 
of “dry ice” (frozen carbon 
dioxide) and supercooled normal 



74 



GALAXY 



T 

ice crystals. While the experi- 
jnents themselves were quite 
scientific, Veraart’s presentation 
of them apparently was not. He 
is said to have made such exag- 
gerated claims that he annoyed 
people just by the way he made 
them. At any event the Royal 
Dutch Ministry of Agriculture as 
well as the Royal Dutch Meteoro- 
logical Society publicly washed 
their hands of the whole affair, 
with the result that other re- 
searchers did not even bother to 
read Veraart’s articles, which 
were written in Dutch. 

There followed some theoreti- 
cal work. In 1933 the Swedish 
meteorologist T or Bergeron stated 
that it should be possible to re- 
lease rain from existing clouds 
by introducing ice crystals into 
them. Five years later the Ger- 
man physicist Walter Findeisen 
went over the problem mathe- 
matically and especially empha- 
sized the need for the natural 
presence of supercooled water 
droplets while the ice crystals 
were being introduced. As often 
happens in science, Bergeron’s 
and Findeisen’s works were 
later lumped under the name of 
the “Bergeron-Findeisen Theory” 
which makes it sound as if they 
had cooperated in the formula- 
tion. 

The next chapter in the story 
bears the name of a company: 
General Electric. It was one of 



those stories which would sound 
pretty weak if it were fiction, but 
in reality things happen that way 
sometimes. It began with a 
request by the Chemical Warfare 
Board to find out just how the 
filters in gas masks do their work. 

General Electric’s chief scien- 
tist, Dr. Irving Langmuir, assisted 
by Dr. Vincent J. Schaefer, went 
to work. Now if you want to test 
filters, you must test them on 
something. So Langmuir and 
Schaefer started producing all 
kinds of “smokes,” which led to 
research on smoke screens in all 
kinds of weather. Cold-weather 
research prompted them to inves- 
tigate aircraft icing. The icing 
of an airplane wing obviously 
builds up from particles in the 
cloud, hence the next point was 
to investigate how ice particles in 
clouds grew. 

CCHAEPER found that crystals 
of dry ice did cause super- 
cooled clouds (small laboratory 
type) to form water ice crystals. 
Bergeron and Findeisen had been 
right. The next problem was 
somewhat different. The tiny ice 
crystals would stay aloft with the 
cloud. Would they grow large 
enough to fall out of the cloud, 
melting into raindrops before 
they hit the ground? This had to 
be tested in the open and in 
November 1946 Dr. Schaefer 
started scattering dry ice pellets

into clouds from above. Yes, the 
ice crystals did grow large enough 
to fall from the cloud. 

Soon afterward another re- 
searcher, Dr. Bernard Vonnegut, 
discovered that microscopic silver 
iodide crystals — one of the 
“smokes” that had been made — 
were more efficient than ice or 
dry ice. For some reason silver 
iodide crystals will cause ice to 
form at higher temperatures than 
either dry ice or water ice. 

Once it had been established 
that something could be done, 
several branches of the govern- 
ment started specific projects. 
One was Project Cirrus, paid for 
by the Army and Navy with 
airplanes supplied by the Air 
Force. Another was the Cloud 
Physics Project, sponsored by the 
Weather Bureau, the Air Force, 
the National Advisory Committee 
for Aeronautics (NACA, now 
NASA) with Navy equipment. 
Then came the Department of 
Defense’s Artificial Cloud Nu- 
cleation Project. 

The result of all this work can 
be summed up in one sentence: 
You can make it rain if the right 
kind of cloud is available. 

A hundred years ago this would 
have been acclaimed as a fan- 
tastic achievement. But now you 
hear voices saying, “Is that all? 
Can’t we really do something 
about the weather? Can’t we at 
least prevent or stop a hurricane?” 



And you hear complaints like, I 
“Why doesn’t anybody think big * 
any more? Why don’t they try to 
melt the polar icecap? It would 
be so simple. And whatever hap. 
pened to the suggestion by the 
Russian fellow who wants to put 
a ring around the Earth like that ' 
of the planet Saturn?” 

As for hurricanes, a big re- 
search program is on the way. 
Before anybody can suggest what ’ 
might be done, he has to know , 
with as much detail as possible 
what is going on. No doctor can 
prescribe a remedy or a treat- 
ment if he does not know what is 
wrong with his patient. The medi- 
cal comparison may be unjust, 
but one of my teachers (the pro- 
fessor of zoology who had started 
out as a medical student) told us 
with a smile that when he was a 
student his teacher faced a medi- 
cal riddle. There were elderly 
people among his patients, mar- 
ried for 30 years or more, having 
slept in the same double bed all 
these years. One was sick, the 
other was not: why didn’t they 
infect each other? The answer, to 
us, is quite simple: the patients 
were diabetics! 

What I mean to say is that 
we haven’t really diagnosed a 
hurricane yet. That nothing can 
be done about one which is in 
force is clear — the Weather 
Bureau estimates that a full- , 
fledged hurricane develops about 



the energy of ten plutonium 
bombs per second. But once we 
know enough, we might be able 
to prevent one from developing. 
Or it might be possible to deflect 
one into areas where it will do 
the least harm. 

N OW let’s have a quick look 
at the “big thoughts,” begin- 
ning with the arctic icecap. Ice 
and snow reflect sunlight well — 
they have, to use astronomical 
language, a very high albedo. If 
you dusted the ice over with 
something dark, like coal dust, 
the albedo would be very strongly 
reduced, the sunlight of the arctic 
summer would be utilized and 
the ice would be melte.d. Let us 
assume for a moment that it 
could be done, all climatologists, 
meteorologists and a good num- 
ber of economists would form a 
united front saying that it cannot 
be taken for granted that this 
would be a wise and beneficial 
move. 

We don’t have to worry about 
the wisdom, however, because Dr. 
H. Wexler, director of meteoro- 
logical research of the U. S. 
Weather Bureau, indulged in a 
little arithmetic {Science, Oct. 
31, 1958) running as follows. The 
layer of coal dust would not 
have to be thick to do its job. 
One-tenth of a millimeter would 
prabably be enough. But the total 
area of the arctic ice pack north of 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



latitude 65 °N. and of the adjacent 
snowfields is 24 • lO” square kilo- 
meters. This calls for 1500 mil- 
lion tons of coal dust. Using 
C-124 Globemasters which could 
carry 10 tons per sortie, it would 
take 150 million sorties to lay 
down the absorbing layer. Natu- 
rally this would take a little time 
to do and in the meantime there 
should be no winds to interfere 
with the experiment and, of 
course, no fresh snow must fall 
on the areas already dusted, 
which is also difficult. 

The idea published by some 
Russian about a ring around the 
Earth has precisely the same set 
of drawbacks. If the Earth had 
a ring like Saturn, the arctic and 
antarctic nights would be illumi- 
nated and somewhat warmed. In 
fact, no night would ever be com- 
pletely black again; there would 
always be about as much light as 
would be shed by half a dozen 
full moons. Unlike the natural 
ring of Saturn, the artificial ring 
should be inclined to the equator; 
an inclination of about 45° would 
probably give the best results if 
the lessening of polar winter 
nights were the main objective. 
Whether this would do more good 
than harm is again a question we 
can’t answer yet. Nobody can say 
at the moment what this steady 
influx of additional if reflected 
sunlight would do to the Earth’s 
climate in general.

^UPPOSE it were mainly good, 
^ what are the logistics of the 
operation? I don’t know the Rus- 
sian figures; I don’t even know 
whether any figures were pub- 
lished. Therefore I had to devise 
my own. I assumed that the ring 
would start 1600 kilometers 
(1000 miles) above sea level and 
that it would be 1000 kilometers 
(about 600 miles) wide. I as- 
sumed a thickness of one kilo- 
meter mostly for the reason that 
it would be very hard to make 
it any thinner. That all this is in 
the area of the inner Van Allen 
belt is relatively unimportant; the 
rockets which lay down the ring 
do not have to be manned. The 
material would best be ice crys- 
tals (Saturn’s natural ring mostly 
consists of ice crystals, too) since 
they reflect the sunlight well and 
do not cost much. 

The area of the ring then be- 
comes in round figures 53 million 
square kilometers. Since it is 
assumed to be one kilometer 
thick, its volume is the same 
figure in cubic kilometers. If we 
allot one milligram of water per 
cubic meter of ring volume, the 
calculations become quite simple. 
One metric ton (2204 lbs. if you 
insist on the measurements of the 
old merchant guilds) weighs 1000 
million milligrams. And one cubic 
kilometer contains 1000 million 
cubic meters. Making the ring, 
therefore, requires as many tons 



of water as its volume in cubic 
kilometers; 53 million metric 
tons. 

But since a milligram of water 
in the form of ice crystals can 
form more than one crystal, we 
might be able to cut down the 
necessary weight somewhat. Let’s 
have just one ice crystal per cubic 
meter, instead of a milligram of 
ice crystals for that volume. If 
we say that each crystal, on the 
average, would weigh one-tenth 
of a milligram, the total amount 
of water would drop to 5.3 million 
tons. If, with super-accurate guid- 
ance, the ring can be made half a 
kilometer (a mere 1640 feet) in 
thickness, we need only 2.6 mil- 
lion tons. 

Had enough of big thoughts? 

Of course we still should try to 
do something about the weather. 
But first we have to learn much 
more about it. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Do meteorites hit the Moon? If 
so, why is there no evidence? 
Astronomers have assured me 
that, so far as we know, meteorites 
must hit the Moon at about the 
same rate ( allowing for the 
smaller size of Luna ) they hit 
the Earth. But if they do, they 
should pockmark the surfaces of 
the maria with craters; they 
should also stir up dust or pumice 
clouds momentarily. In either 



78 



GALAXY 



case we might not be able to see 
the impact but we should see the 
result. When the Moon is dark, 
the smash of a meteorite on stone 
should certainly set up a spark of 
light which would be visible (com- 
paratively speaking) as a match 
lit a long way off on a dark night. 
Finally it seems reasonable that, 
at one time or another, since 
Galilei, the Moon must have 
been clobbered by a big meteor 
on the facing side. This would 
leave a new crater . but ap- 
parently no change in the Moon’s 
surface has ever been discovered. 
Can you explain this odd situa- 
tion? 

Boyd Hill 

Playa del Rey, Calif. 

Well, I can try to explain it. 
But before I go on, I want to go 
on record that this reply is being 
typed on August 10, 1960, just in 
case the Moon is struck by a 
colossal body the next day and 
the whole answer becomes negli- 
gible, superfluous and obsolete. 

First let us be clear about one 
point. The gravitational field of a 
planet (or large moon) is of very 
minor, if any, importance with 
regard to the number of meteor- 
ites striking it. The meteorites 
are simply in orbits around the 
sun and sometimes a planet and 
a meteorite happen to be on 
collision courses. The gravita- 
tional field of the Earth might 



help in changing an “almost col- 
lision course” (near miss of a 
quarter-mile) into a collision 
course, but that is all. 

Therefore, in a comparison be- 
tween the number of solid parti- 
cles which either the Earth or 
the Moon will sweep out of space, 
we don’t have to wonder about 
the comparison of their gravita- 
tional field. All that counts are 
their cross sections — the size of 
the “target,” so to speak. 

The Earth’s diameter is abbut 
7950 miles, that of the Moon 
about 2160. The area of “Target 
Earth” is, therefore, a little more 
than fourteen times that of 
“Target Moon.” All you have to 
do is to compare the squares of 
the diameters, or of the radii. 
Since we know, or can estimate, 
the number of particles swept up 
by the Earth, the number swept 
up by the Moon would be about 
l/14th of the figure for the Earth. 
But since we can see only about 
one-half of the lunar surface, the 
number of impacts that might be 
seen would be only 1/2 8th of 
what we get for the whole Earth. 
To simplify life a bit, let’s say 
that the Earth will sustain 30 
times as many hits as the visible 
hemisphere of the Moon. 

No actual count of what hits 
the Earth is possible, but the 
generally accepted estimate is a 
total of 7500 million particles 
during a 24-hour period. Of this 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



79 



number about 6500 million parti- 
cles have a diameter smaller than 
half a millimeter. Some 20,000 
per 24-hour period will have a 
size of half an inch or larger. Half 
a dozen will be fist-sized or even 
larger. What our Earth sweeps 
out of space in the course of a 
day has been labeled “a very large 
dump truck of dust with a few 
pebbles in it.” 

How will this look to an ob- 
server? Well, everything smaller 
than one millimeter in diameter 
will simply be invisible. The ones 
one millimeter in diameter could 
be made out as a faint “shooting 
star” on a dark night. Those which 
are larger than an inch will be 
“rather bright,” while those of the 
size of a man’s fist would light up 
the landscape as they pass over- 
head. 

Offhand, I would guess that a 
meteorite which hits the Moon 
would have to weigh at least 25 
pounds to make an impact that 
could be seen from Earth if it 
hits the dark portion of the Moon 
and if somebody happens to be 
looking through a reasonably 
powerful telescope. Earth may 
collect one per month, which 
means that the visible portion of 
the Moon would collect one every 
three years. But remember the 
other requirements: somebody 

would have to look through a 
telescope at the dark portion of 
the Moon (which is not too cus- 



tomary) at the right time. Still, j 
every once in a while an observer 
has reported a spot of light; in : 
some cases it might have been a 
meteoric impact. 

Not even a 50-pounder would 
produce a crater which would be 
visible from Earth, even through 
a powerful telescope. We don’t 
know just how much would be 
needed, but the Russian payload 
that did hit the Moon gives a 
basis for a few guesses. The 
weight of that payload was 
around 800 pounds and the Rus- 
sians fired for the center of the 
visible half of the Moon. Natu- 
rally they timed their shot so 
they would be able to observe the 
impact — of course when they 
have night, we have daylight. 
They claim they could observe 
the dust cloud caused by the 
impact. They calculated that the 
impact of the lunar probe itself 
would have caused a crater 600 
feet in diameter and the impact 
of the top stage of their rocket a 
crater 850 feet in diameter, pro- 
vided they struck a thick dust 
layer. For striking solid rock, the 
crater diameters would have been 
33 feet for the probe and 50 feet 
for the rocket. They must have 
struck solid rock, because so far 
no photographs of the two new 
craters could be produced. 

Since small lunar formations 
are pinpointed by their shadows 
at sunrise and sunset rather than 

GALAXY 



by direct visibility, the failure to 
find the impact craters of the 
Russian moonshot is not surpris- 
ing. At the very best they would 
be at the limit of detectability, if 
they had struck in an otherwise 
featureless plain. Obviously they 
did not. Equally obviously a 1000- 
pound meteorite would not pro- 
duce a conspicuous crater. 

One more point to be 
considered is the question of for 
how long we have good lunar 
maps. We can’t count from the 
invention of the telescope — some 
of the names proposed by the 
Italian Riccioli for lunar forma- 
tions are not in use now for the 
simple reason that modern astron- 
omers are not sure just which 
formations Riccioli had in mind. 
We can say that we have maps 
which might be good enough to 
help in spotting a new crater for 
only the past 80 years. It is easily 
possible that nothing big enough 
struck the Moon on the visible 
hemisphere during that time. 

On Earth we had two known 
meteorite falls of sufficient size in 
this period, both striking in 
Siberia. One was in 1908, the 
other a dozen years ago. (Of 
course a few more big ones might 
have fallen into the oceans, or in 
Greenland, or in Antarctica, 
though no trace has been found.) 
But considering the ratio of about 
30 to 1, it isn’t at all surprising 
that no new crater has appeared

on the Moon during the last 80 
years. 

Why wouldn’t it be a good idea 
to build some sort of catapult for 
getting our larger rockets off the 
ground? 

(Name withheld ) 

San Francisco, Calif. 

I am withholding the name be- 
cause I ■ had to reply to my 
correspondent that (A) it is not 
a good idea, that (B) I get this 
question about once a week and 
that (C) the Space Agency 
(NASA) gets it twice a day, if 
not more often. This constant 
stream of the same question 
has, incidentally, been reinforced 
by some magazine writer who 
claimed to know that this was the 
way the Russians got their satel- 
lites into orbit. I may insert here 
that it is just possible that this 
is one more of the many trans- 
lators’ mistakes which have been 
plaguing us recently. The Russian 
word for catapult is the same as 
ours (it is one of those interna- 
tional words which are the same 
in most languages, like “radio,” 
“airplane,” “transistor” and so 
forth) and it is conceivable that 
the word is applied to a booster 
rocket. 

But I still have to explain why 
it is not a good idea. 

If you want to accelerate a 
rocket initially by means of a 



80 



81 



catapult, you deal with several 
factors. The first one is how fast 
you want your rocket to be going 
at the instant it leaves the cata- 
pult; or, phrased differently, how 
much velocity you want the cata- 
pult to supply. The second factor 
is the length of travel of the 
catapult — through what distance 
does it move? Both these factors 
together tell you what the accel- 
eration will have to be. 

Now the solid-fuel booster of 
the old Aerobee rocket supplied 
just short of 1000 feet per second, 
or 300 meters, since 300 meters 
equal 984 feet. To supply any less 
than this velocity would not be 
worth the effort, so let’s stick to 
this figure. 

The three factors in question 
are tied together by the simple 
equation: a=vV2s. In this equa- 
tion “a” stands for the acceleration 
which will result, “v '” is the square 
of the velocity desired, while “s” 
is the distance traveled in the 
course of producing the desired 
velocity. Now let us check the 
values with this velocity in mind. 
First doing the righthand portion 
of the equation, we have to 
assume a value for “s” and for a 
first attempt we make “s” equal 
to 984 feet too, or 300 meters. 
Then vV2s reads 90,000 divided 
by 600, which is 150. This figure 
stands for the mean acceleration 
the rocket would have to stand. 
One g in the metric system is 

82 



9.81 m/sec“ so that this figure of 
150 means just about 1-1/2 g. 

Well, this is fine. The rocket 
will be able to stand an accelera- 
tion of 1-1/2 g. Yes, but no cata- 
pult is a thousand feet tall. In 
reality we’d probably have to be 
satisfied with a hundred feet, in 
which case our rocket would have 
to undergo an acceleration of 15 
g. Some of the smaller solid-fuel 
jobs might be able to take this 
without being deformed (and 
blowing up) in the process. But 
a liquid-fuel rocket just could not 
stand this acceleration, and cer- 
tainly not a big one. 

So things boil down to the 
following choices: You provide 
only 100 or 200 feet per second. 
In this case it isn’t worth the 
trouble. Or else you strengthen 
the rocket to withstand the high 
acceleration, in which case you 
have more dead weight in the 
rocket itself and you pay a higher 
penalty for the dead weight than 
you gain by even a thousand feet 
per second. 

With all this we haven’t yet 
touched another point, a rather 
sore one, namely the expense of 
the catapult — and its own 
weight. If you want to help an 
Atlas off the ground, you have 
to accelerate (in round figures) 
100 tons. The moving portion of 
the catapult would have to weigh 
at least 10 tons. And you have 
to move these ten tons too. This

will cost fuel of some kind. The 

V same amount of fuel will do more 
■ good if it is incorporated in the 

rocket itself — and you save the 
price of the catapult. 

For the Puzzle Addicts 

I am sorry I forgot to give the 
explanation (as quite a number 
of readers reminded me) of the 
problem of the two Dutchmen 
with only one bike. What you 
need here is not mathematics but 
logic. No matter how the course 
is broken up, each one gets to 
ride a total of half the total 
distance. So, obviously, they save 
travel time — as one reader 
proved by the use of integral 
equations. 

Now here is another one, crib- 
bed from -a friendly European 
magazine the name of which will 
be revealed with the answer in 
the next issue. The sequence of 
the first nine whole numbers is, 
of course, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 
9. You must leave them in this 
sequence. But between them you 
may insert plus and minus signs, 

, or multiplication signs or dividing 
signs. You may use the figures in 
the forrrT (3 + 4+5) or (3 
times 4) or even in the form 23 
or 56. All that is needed is that 
they remain in their natural se- 
quence. No fractions permitted 
(like 234/56), nor figures of the 
type of 3‘. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



The result must be 100. 

I’ll add that it can be done in 
several ways. 

Is This Your Real Name? 

^1 ■'HINKING about a concluding 
item for this column, the fact 
that the last two words always 
are my name reminded me of the 
most surprising question I ever 
got after a lecture. It was in 
Chicago and the custom of the 
particular group which sponsored 
my lecture was to admit written 
questions only, “to avoid speeches 
from the floor.” One of these 
written questions read: “Is this 
your real name?” 

I first asked back to find out 
whether the question concerned 
my own name and I heard a 
timid “yes,” followed by the ques- 
tion whether it should not be 
Wilhelm or William. Since others 
may have worried about the same 
important problem. I’ll give an 
answer here (as I did in the 
lecture hall) hoping that this will 
end the discussion. 

No, my first name is not 
Wilhelm or William, it is Willy, 
as stated on the certificate of 
birth, the certificate of baptism, 
the certificate of confirmation and 
my old (German) passport. Willy 
(in this spelling and this spelling 
only) is a separate, full-fledged 
and officially recognized name. 
Contemporaries who have the 

83 



same name are Willy Brandt, the 
mayor of West Berlin, and Prof. 
Willy Messerschmitt, the airplane 
designer. Actually I was named 
after Prof. Willy Stdwer, a 
painter who around the time of 
my birth had the pleasure of 
knowing that reproductions of his 
paintings could be found in any 
German home. They were of 
ships, usually the High Seas Fleet. 

As for my last name, it means 
“cliff” or “rock” (e.g., Loreley, the 
first part of that designation being 
spelled “lure” in English). I prob- 
ably had an unfortunate ancestor 
who was the unproud owner of 
land full of big rocks. I recently 
came across an English name 
with the same meaning: Stone- 
acre. But for those who are likely 
to check with books on the origin 
of names, I wish to add that I 
have done so myself. Both works 



I checked — one about fifty years 
older than the other — agree: 
Ley, “rock” or “cliff,” or else de- 
rived from St. Eligius. 

I didn’t think the St. Eligius 
part could possibly apply to me, 
but just on principle I checked 
on St. Eligius and learned that 
he is the patron saint of the 
blacksmiths. Now I’m not sure 
which is which. My father’s father 
was a blacksmith (until he 
opened a tavern) and he told me 
that his smithy had been family 
property for generations. In fact, 
he believed that his ancestors had 
settled in East Prussia as ar- 
morers to the Teutonic Knights. 

In that case, I won’t have to 
pity the unknown ancestor who 
was stuck with rocky land but can 
sign off in the knowledge that my 
name is really Smith.

W HEN he was alone in 
his office with the pris- 
oner, the director said: 
“Now, what is this secret you can 
reveal to my ears alone?” 

“Are you sure none of them 
are listening?” The prisoner was 
a young man with seedy clothing 
and an odd haircut. As he spoke, 
he managed to grin in a con- 
spiratorial way, as if he already 
shared some vital and amusing 
secret with Director Ahlgren.

And this is about the average 
of the Underground, thought the 
director, studying his victim with 
distaste. And in the next room 
Barbara waited her turn at being 
interrogated. How could she 
have ever become connected, 
however indirectly, ' with the 
ideals or people of this Under- 
ground represented before him? 

“None of them are listening,” 
said the director, who took daily 
steps to discourage that sort of 
thing among his subordinates. It 
was not entirely unheard of for 
a Party member to turn traitor 
and join the Underground. 
“Quickly now, what have you to 
tell me?” 

“This — I will act as a double 
agent for you,” volunteered the 
young wretch, in a stage whisper, 
maintaining the idiotic grin. He 
sat propped erect in his chair by 
a stiff pillow the director kept 
handy for such use, his voluntary 
muscles still mainly paralyzed 
from the stun pistols of the 
Political Police. 

Director Ahlgren frowned 
thoughtfully. He took a cigarette 
from a box on his plain but 
highly polished desk. “Care for 
one?” 

“No, no. Do you understand 
what I am offering you? I am a 
highly trained agent, and I will 
betray them all to you, because 
you are the strongest here, and 
I must serve the strongest.” The 



young man nodded earnestly as 
if he hoped the director would 
imitate the movement and so 
agree with him. 

The director puffed smoke. 
“Very well, I accept. Now you 
must show me that you will 
really do what you say. Tell me 
the address of your contact 
cell.” 

T^HE YOUNG rebel contorted 
his forehead, in an apparent 
effort to conceive a stroke of 
Machiavellian strategy. 

Ahlgren pursued him. “I know 
each cell of the Underground has 
its contact with the rest of the 
organization through one other 
cell and that you know the 
address of yours. How can I 
trust you as a double agent if 
you won’t tell me that much?” 
“Wouldn’t any of the others 
tell you? My dear comrades 
from my own cell?” 

All the dear comrades seemed 
to have taken memory-scram- 
bling drugs, as captured rebels 
often did, though the director 
sometimes thought it a super- 
fluous action on their part. 

“None of the others offered to 
act as a double agent.” Ahlgren 
was trying to humor this babbler 
out of the one piece of valuable 
information he was likely to 
possess. 

“Our comrades in the contact 
cell will have heard about the 

GALAXY 



arrests this morning,” said the 
prisoner, with a sudden happy 
thought. “They’ll have moved 
already anyway.” 

Quite likely true, Director 
Ahlgren knew. “So it can’t hurt 
them if you tell me,” he en- 
couraged. 

The prisoner pondered a mo- 
ment longer, then named an 
address in a quiet residential 
section about a mile from the 
Party Building. 

“Anything else you can tell 
me?” 

Careful consideration. “No.” 

PolPol Chief Lazar and a 
couple of guards came into the 
office quickly after the director 
touched the signal button. 

“Take him down to Condition- 
ing,” said the director, leaning 
back in his chair. He felt his 
head beginning to ache. 

The rebel screamed and rolled 
his head, about the most violent 
motion he could make, as the 
two PolPol guards caught him 
gently by the arms and lifted 
him from his chair. 

“Traitor! You are the traitor, 
not I! You have betrayed my 
confidence, your own honor, you 
— ” He seemed suddenly to 
realize what was going to happen 
to him. “Conditioning! No, not 
my mind, not my mind! Can’t 
you beat me or something in- 
stead? I won’t be meee any 
lonnnggerrrr ...” 

VOLUME PAA-PYX 



The screaming died away 
down the corridor outside the 
office. 

“Careful with him,” Lazar 
called sharply to the guards, 
from the doorway. “Don’t let his 
legs bump, there. You bruised 
that man this morning; we want 
no more of that.” 

He came back into the office, 
closing the door, viewing Ahl- 
gren with the proper expression 
of respect. “Would you like me 
to conduct the next interview, 
sir?” 

“No. Why do you ask?” 

“I thought you might feel a 
certain reluctance, sir. I under- 
stand you knew the young lady 
years ago.” 

“Before I joined the Party. 
Yes, quite right, I did.” The di- 
rector arose from his chair and 
walked toward the wide window, 
past the bookshelves that almost 
filled one wall, giving the office 
the air of a study and concealing 
his secret exit. 

Tj^ROM the window he looked 
out upon the sunset that red- 
dened the sky over his prosper- 
ous city where bright lights 
were coming on against the dusk. 

I understand Lazar, he 
thought, because he is ambitious, 
as I am, or as I was. Under one 
of the old dictatorships, I would 
have had to fear such ambition 
in a subordinate and consider 



86 



87 



taking steps against him. But I 
need not fear Lazar, because the 
Party claims his perfect loyalty, 
and he can do nothing against 
me until I begin to fail the 
Party. And is that time perhaps 
drawing near? Will my secret 
exit always be only a private 
joke? 

Watching his own eyes in the 
half-mirror of the window, the 
director told himself: Someone 
must govern the people; some- 
one always has. The worldwide 
Party does better than the old 
governrnents. There are no wars. 
There is no corruption and no 
real struggle for power among 
Party members, because there is 
practically no disobedience in 
the carefully chosen ranks. The 
mass of the citizens seem content 
with their bread and circuses. 
There is only the Underground, 
and maybe some kind of Under- 
ground is necessary in any so- 
ciety. 

“Lazar.” 

“Sir?” 

“How do we do it? How do 
we attain such perfection of 
power that the essence of power 
is enough, that we have no need 
to constantly threaten or stupefy 
the citizens?” 

The gay and active city below 
was now brightening itself 
against the gathering night. No 
giant signs proclaimed the glories 
of the Party. No monolithic 



statues deified the World Di- 
rectors, past or present. The 
Party was invisible. 

Lazar seemed a bit shocked at 
the question. “The selfless obedi- 
ence of each individual is the life 
and strength of the Party, sir.” 
A phrase from the catechism. 

“Of course . but look, Lazar. 
That Citizens Policeman direct- 
ing traffic down there. He’s prob- 
ably never even thought of join- 
ing the Party. He wears a stun 
pistol, because of the non-polit- 
ical criminals he must sometimes 
deal with; but if one of your 
PolPol agents were to walk up to 
him and arrest him, the odds are 
he would offer no resistance. 
Now why? The Citizens Police 
are as well armed and I think 
more numerous than your men.” 
Lazar studied the traffic cop 
below through narrowed eyes. “I 
can’t remember when we’ve had 
to arrest a Citizens Policeman.” 
“Neither can I. The point is — 
how do we do it?” 

“Superior dedication and dis- 
cipline will prevail, sir.” 

“Yes.” But the parroted 
phrases were no real answer. 
The Citizens Police were pre- 
sumably disciplined and dedi- 
cated, too. Lazar was unwilling 
or unable to really discuss the 
subject. 

Such questions had not oc- 
curred to Ahlgren himself until 
recently. He could not remember 



88 



GALAXY 



ever seriously considering the 
possibility of himself opposing 
the Party in any way, even be- 
fore that day five years ago when 
he had been accepted as a 
member. 

“And we of the Party control 
the means of Conditioning,” said 
Lazar. 

“Conditioning, yes.” Barbara. 
He had to fight to keep anything 
from showing in his face. It was 
hard. 

He knew there was not one 
person in the gay and bright-lit 
city before him who could not 
be brought to the basement of 
this building at any time, at a 
word from himself, to undergo 
Conditioning. The Ultimate Pain, 
he had heard it called by Party 
theorists. But it needed no dram- 
atization. 

The citizens had a slang term 
for it that he had heard some- 
where: brain-boiling. 

The office intercom sounded 
on the director’s desk. “Chief La- 
zar’s office would like him to 
come in, if possible.” Tight se- 
curity. No details would be 
spoken unnecessarily over even 
the director’s line. No risks would 
be taken at all. 

He was faintly relieved. “Your 
office wants you for something; 
I won’t need you here any longer. 
Good job today.” 

“Thank you, sir.” Lazar was 
gone in a moment. 



A HLGREN was alone in his 
soft-lit office. His eyes 
ranged along the bookshelves. 
The Party put no restrictions on 
reading. Aquinas — some of the 
Eastern philosophers — Thomas 
Paine — Russell. The encyclo- 
pedia, with the gap where that 
one volume had been missing 
for a week. Volume P. What the 
devil could have happened to it? 
Was there a kleptomaniac on his 
staff? It seemed absurd for any- 
one to steal an ordinary book. 

But he was only procrastina- 
ting. He went to sit again at his 
desk, leafed through papers. 
Bulky contracts and specifica- 
tions for the new water supply 
for his city. And the Citizens 
Council had voted a new tax; he 
would have to hire collectors. 
Too much non-political work, as 
usual, and now the Underground 
flaring up again, and — 

He keyed the intercom and 
ordered, “Bring the girl in,” with- 
out giving himself any more time 
to think about what he was going 
to have to do. 

He sat waiting, his head ach- 
ing, trying to hold nerves and 
face and hands steady. The Pol- 
Pol report on Barbara was on 
his desk, mixed up now with the 
waterworks, and he read it for 
the hundredth time. She had 
spoken in public against the 
Party this morning in the pres- 
ence of a PolPol officer.

She came into the office quiet- 
ly, between the blank-faced uni- 
formed PolPol women. She 
walked unaided and Ahlgren 
felt a faint, smothered gladness 
that it had not been necessary 
to stun her. 

“Leave us,” he told the guards, 
who instantly obeyed. Would it 
look suspicious for him to want 
to be alone with another prison- 
er? It didn’t matter — in a few 
minutes he would send her to 
Conditioning, because he had to 
send her; there was nothing else 
the Party could do with her. He 
felt his heart sinking. 

He met her eyes for the first 
time and was vastly grateful to 
see no terror in them. 

“Sit down, Barbara.” 

She sat without speaking and 
watched him as if more sorry 
for him than for herself. It was 
her look of that day years ago, 
when he had told her of losing 
a job ... If I had married her in 
those days, he thought, as I al- 
most did, and never joined the 
Party, I would now be sitting 
in some outer office waiting, des- 
perate to do anything to spare 
her the Pain, but helpless. Now 
I sit here, representing the Party, 
still helpless. But no, if I had 
married her I would have found 
some way to keep her from this. 

“I’m sorry, Barbara,” he said 
finally. “You know what I must 
do.” 



The waiting, unchanging sym- 
pathy of her eyes wrenched at 
him. She had never been beauti- 
ful, really, but so utterly alive. 

“I — would like you to come 
back when you are — recovered,” 
he heard himself maundering. 
“You’ll be all — ” 

“Will you be able to marry me 
then?” Her first words to him 
burst out in a voice near break- 
ing, like a question held in too 
long, that she had not meant to 
speak aloud. 

He sat up straight in his chair, 
feeling as if the world had sud- 
denly shaken beneath him. “How 
can you ask me that? You know 
I can’t marry — I have chosen 
the Party!” He gripped the desk 
to stop his hands from trem- 
bling; then he realized that she 
must be only making a desperate 
attempt to save herself from 
Conditioning. 

6iTN THE name of the Party, 
sir,” said City PolPol Chief 
Lazar in a hushed and slightly 
awed voice, shaking the hand 
thrust toward him by District 
Director Perkins. They stood in 
a small room in the basement 
of the Party Building in Ahl- 
gren’s city. One-way glass in a 
wall showed a view of a Treat- 
ment Room where Conditioning 
was sometimes practiced. 

“Lazar. I’ve studied your rec- 
ord.” Perkins’ handshake was 



90 



GALAXY

massive, like his bearing. “I think 
you may be taking over in this 
city very soon, so I had you 
called down here to watch some- 
thing. The doctors called me in 
the District Capital last night 
about Ahlgren and we’ve ar- 
ranged a little test for him to- 
day — he doesn’t know I’m 
here, of course. We should be 
able to see the climax, if things 
go as planned.” 

“I — I hardly know what to 
say, sir.” 

Perkins eyed him shrewdly. 
“Think maybe you’re the one be- 
ing tested? No, son, not today. 
But it won’t hurt you to see this.” 
He frowned. “Ahlgren started out 
well in the Party, too. Seemed 
to have a fine future ahead of 




him. Now . Perkins shook 
his head. 

A door leading to a corridor 
opened and a man dressed in 
the green smock of a doctor 
stuck his head into the room. 
“Would you mind if I watched 
from here, sir?” 

“No, no, come in. Lazar, this 
is Citizen Schmidt. Doctor 
Schmidt, I should say, eh?” 
Lazar acknowledged the intro- 
duction perfunctorily. A loyal 
non-Party citizen was neither a 
political danger nor a competitor 
for advancement, and therefore 
almost totally uninteresting. 

Lazar turned to study the 
Treatment Room through the 
one-way glass. It was not im- 
pressive, except for the treatment 
table in the center, a low mon- 
strous thing of wires and power. 
There were soft lights, chairs, a 
desk in one corner, and above the 
desk a small bookshelf. Lazar 
could see that one book had been 
placed behind the others, as if 
someone had tried to hide it. 
Looking closer, he made out that 
it was part of an encyclopedia. 
Volume Paa-Pyx. 

A HLGREN was holding Bar- 
■^^bara by the wrists; he pulled 
her across the desk and kissed 
her. His decision had been made 
with no real struggle at all. May- 
be he had made the decision 
weeks or months ago, without 



knowing, and had just beeiil 
traveling with the Party on inJ 
ertia. Barbara trembled and tried, 
to pull back and then let herself 
go against him. She was not only, 
acting to save herself now; she 
could not be. 

“They say life can be good 
again after Conditioning, Bar- 
bara,” he whispered to her. “They 
say many regain full normal in- 
telligence. They say — no, I 
could never send you to that! 
Not you, not that!” 

“Oh, Jim, Jim.” Years since 
anyone had called him by that 
name. Or was it so long? A half- 
memory came disturbingly and 1 
fled before he could grasp it. But ' 
a real memory came plainly to 
him, bringing with it a plan of 
action that was at least better 
than nothing: the memory of the 
address the young rebel had 
spoken to his ears alone. 

“Listen!” He grabbed Bar- 
bara’s arm and held her away 
from him. “There may be one 
chance, just one small chance for 
us.‘’ 

“What?” 

“The Underground. I have an 
address.” 

“No, Jim. You can’t do that.” 
She backed away, looking toward 
the door as if she heard the 
guards coming to seize them 
both. 

“Why not? Don’t you under- 
stand what Conditioning means? 



Don’t you understand what you 
are facing?” 

“Yes, but . .” Indecision 
showed in her voice and manner. 
“I don’t know if I should try to 
tell you.” 

“Tell me what? Don’t you 
realize what you’re facing?” 

“Yes, but you . .” 

“Me?” So she could think of 
his welfare first, even while she 
faced the Ultimate Pain. She 
roust have loved him all these 
years. “I’ve had enough of the 
Party anyway.” The words came 
so easily and sincerely to his 
lips that he was surprised as if 
at hypocrisy in himself, but it 
was not that. Somehow in the 
past few minutes his whole out- 
look on the world had shifted 
abruptly; the change must have 
been building for a long time. 

His mind raced ahead, plan- 
ning, while Barbara watched his 
face intently, one hand held up 
to her mouth. 

He pulled a stun pistol out of 
his desk, checked the charge and 
thrust it into his belt. “Follow 
me. Quickly.” 

A section of the bookcase 
swung outward at his touch. He 
led Barbara into the narrow pas- 
sage in the wall and indicated an 
unmarked phone set into a small 
niche. “Private line to District 
HQ. This may buy us a little 
time.” 

She reached out tentatively 



to restrain him, clenched her fin- 
gers and made no objection. 

He picked up the phone and 
waited until he heard someone 
on the other end, then said: “Ahl- 
gren here. Rebel plot. They’ve in- 
filtrated. I must flee.” He hung 
up. Of course District HQ would 
doubt the message, but it should 
divide at least for a time the 
energies of the Party that would 
now be arrayed against him — 
and against the frightened girl 
he now led toward the tiny se- 
cret elevator that would take 
them down to street level. In his 
revolt against the authority he 
had accepted for so long, he felt 
less alone than he had for years. 

>^HEY emerged into open air 
by coming out of the wall in 
a little-used entrance to a rather 
shabby apartment house a block 
from the Party Building, after 
Ahlgren had studied the glow- 
panel-lit hallway through a peep- 
hole to make sure it was unoc- 
cupied. 

He had discarded his uniform 
belt and insignia inside the se- 
cret passage; his jacket l^id the 
butt of the pistol in his belt. If 
no one looked too closely at him, 
he might pass in the half-dark 
streets for a plainly dressed citi- 
zen. 

They walked the side streets 
toward the Underground ad- 
dress, not going fast enough to

attract attention. Barbara held 
his arm and from time to time 
looked back over her shoulder 
until he whispered to her to stop 
it. Other couples strolled past 
them and beside them; the nor- 
mal evening life of the city pro- 
gressed around them as if the 
Party and the Underground were 
no more than fairy stories. 

The young rebel might have 
told someone else the address be- 
fore or after Conditioning had 
wrenched and battered his mind 
out of human shape. Ahlgren 
could not rely on the place be- 
ing even temporarily safe. Bar- 
bara and he could only pause 
there in their flight, warn any 
Underground people they could 
find, and try to flee with them 
to some place of slightly less 
danger, if any existed. It was a 
weak chance, but their only one. 
There had been no time at all 
to plan anything better. Rebel- 
lion against the Party had burst 
in Ahlgren with the suddenness 
of a PolPol raid. His very lack of 
preparation for this step and his 
good record to date might make 
District think for a long time 
that he was indeed the victim of 
infiltrating Underground plotters. 

The address proved to be that 
of a middle-sized, unremarkable 
building in a lower-class residen- 
tial area, two or three apartments 
over a quiet-looking small tavern. 
A single front entrance divided 



inside, where stairs led up to the) 
apartments and two steps led 
down to the level of the tavern. 

A couple of male patrons 
looked around from the bar with 
mild interest as Ahlgren and the 
girl entered. They and the bar- 
tender seemed nothing but solid 
citizen types. 

While Ahlgren hesitated, un- 
certain of what to say or whether 
to speak at all, the bartender 
said suddenly: “Oh, that bunch. 
They’re upstairs.” The man’s 
face assumed an unhappy look, 

Ahlgren took no time to worry 
over whether he and Barbara 
were such obvious rebels already, 
or how the bartender fitted in. 
The PolPol might be right on 
their heels. He only nodded and 
led Barbara up the stairs. 

There were two doors at the 
top; he chose at random and 
knocked. No answer. He tried 
the other. After at least a minute 
of feverishly quiet rapping on 
both doors, one opened enough 
to reveal a thin man with a blank 
suspicious stare. 

“Let us in,” Ahlgren whispered 
desperately. “It is vital to the 
Underground.” The PolPol might 
close in at any moment; he had 
to take the chance and speak 
plainly. His hand was under his 
jacket on the butt of his stun 
pistol and his foot was in the 
door. 

“I don’t know what you mean,” 
GALAXY 



said the thin man tonelessly. 

“Look at me! I am the director 
of this city. I have deserted the 
party.” 

T he man’s eyes widened and 
there were excited whisper- 
ings in the room behind him. 
“Let them in, Otto,” said a voice. 

Ahlgren pushed his way into 
the room, dragging Barbara with 
him. A fat man sat at a table 
with a bottle and glasses before 
him, and a little pile of dingy 
books and folders on the floor at 
his feet. A pair of unwholesome- 
looking women sat on a sagging 
couch along one wall. A door 
with a homemade look in an- 
other wall seemed to lead into 
the other apartment. Evidently 
the Underground used the whole 
second floor. 

Ahlgren wasted no time with 
preliminaries. “Listen to me. The 
PolPol may be on their way here 
now. Get out while you can and 
take us with you. Have you some 
place to run to?” 

The fat man regarded Ahlgren 
owlishly and belched. “Not so 
fast. How do we know — ” 

There was a glare of search- 
lights against the dirty windows, 
through the drawn shades, and 
a booming amplified voice: “Ahl- 
gren, come out peacefully. We 
know you’re there. Ahlgren, come 
out.” 

He gripped Barbara and 
VOLUME PAA-PYX 



looked into her eyes. “Try to 
remember me after the Pain.” 
“Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, you don’t 
know, you don’t understand!” 

He dragged her downstairs, 
seeking a way out of the trap. 
The PolPol would have the 
building surrounded, of course, 
but they would expect him to 
flee upward, to try to fight them 
off on the stairs, and perhaps try 
to escape over the roofs, as rebels 
often did. 

The four Underground people 
had burst into passionate argu- 
ment, but were doing nothing 
purposeful. 

The lights were out in the 
tavern downstairs. The two pa- 
trons were standing behind the 
bar, the attitude of their vague 
shapes suggesting that they were 
waiting as interested spectators. 
The windows here too glared 
wfth searchlights, and the bar- 
keep stood in the middle of the 
room glaring at Ahlgren. 

“Ahlgren! Come out peacefully 
and no one will be hurt! Your 
case will be fairly heard!” 

“Why don’t you just do like 
the man says?” the barkeep sug- 
gested angrily. 

What was wrong with these 
people? Didn’t they realize — 
but he had no time. 

“Shut up. Where does that 
back door lead?” 

“Nowhere. I keep it locked.” 
The barkeep swore. “Hope they

don’t smash the place, but they 
sure as hell will if you don’t go 
out. Sure, they say, we pay com- 
pensation, but look how long it 
takes. Sure, the glass they put 
in won’t cut nobody, but I gotta 
sweep it up and put up pl3rwood 
panels. Why don’t you just go 
out?” 

“Take it easy, Sam,” said one 
of the patrons behind the bar, 
with a chuckle. Barbara was bab- 
bling, too, something she was sor- 
ry for, or sorry about. 

A window smashed in and a 
PolPol officer stood outlined in 
the frame, flashlight in one hand 
sweeping the room. The director 
shot first. The invisible soundless 
stun beam doubled up the man; 
the flashlight spun crazily 
through the room as he dropped 
it. Ahlgren picked up a stool to 
batter at the rear door. It was 
the only way left. 

“That don’t go nowhere, I told 
ya! Stop! Why did I ever sign 
up?” the barkeep moaned, grab- 
bing at Ahlgren to keep him from 
smashing at the door with the 
stool. 

Ahlgren let him have the stun 
beam at close range. 

It didn’t bother the man in 
the least. 

“Not on me, friend not on me. 
Tickle all you want,” the barkeep 
said in obscure triumph, pulling 
the stool from Ahlgren’s grip, 
which loosened from surprise. 



The director felt the paralyz- 
ing tickle of a beam stab his own 
side; he had time to see Lazar 
grinning in at a window before 
sinking to the floor and into un- 
consciousness. 

TTE WAS slumped in a chair 
-^propped up by a stiff pillow 
when awareness returned. There 
was a sense of strangeness in his 
mind that he could not fully ac- 
count for by what he remem- 
bered happening. Drugs? They 
were seldom used on anyone. 

It was a Treatment Room; 
they were not going to waste 
any time. Lazar’s face looked 
down at him, grinning, as he had 
seen it at the tavern window. 
Two or three of the green- 
smocked doctors who always ad- 
ministered Conditioning stood 
beside the monstrous table, 
watching him and waiting. And 
Barbara. She stood free in the 
background, not stunned or re- 
strained in any way. 

Lazar caught the direction of 
his gaze. 

“Oh, yes, the young lady has 
been most helpful to us, future 
Citizen Ahlgren. It was in large 
part her idea — ” 

“Please.” The doctor’s voice 
had an edge to it. “I must insist, 
sir, that you not interfere with 
treatment.” 

“Very well.” Lazar’s grin was 
wider than ever. He touched Ahl- 



VOLUME PAA-PYX 



97 




gren’s shoulder as one might pat 
a dog about to be gassed. “I was 
comfortably set to watch this 
show when you made me get up 
and work for it. But it’ll be worth 
the trouble. Good luck in your 
new life.” He went out jauntily. 

Ahlgren let his eyelids close; 
he could not look at Barbara. 
She was whispering with a doc- 
tor. He prayed to the God of 
his childhood for the Pain to 
come quickly and bring complete 
forgetfulness. 

A doctor was in front of Ahl- 
gren. “Open your eyes. Look at 
me. Trust me. Never mind who’s 
watching or that you think you’ve 
been betrayed. We didn’t plan 
that, but it can’t be helped now. 
I want you to do something and 
it won’t hurt. Will you try?” 

The doctor’s eyes burned 
down. His voice compelled. 

Ahlgren was held. “Try what?” 
he asked. 

“What do you think it is I 
want?” the doctor asked with 
calm patience. “Try to remem- 
ber.” 

Remember? What was there 
to remember? Ahlgren’s eye 
roved about the room, fell upon 
the little bookshelf above the 
desk in one corner, and slid away 
again. But he supposed there was 
no escape from — what? 

“You can get up now if you 
like, Jim. Move around.” 

He tried. His legs pushed him 



w 



erect. His arms functioned. Sur- 
prisingly, he could move; it took 
an effort but was not painful. 
How long had he been out from 
the stunning? 

He found himself approaching 
the little bookshelf, while the 
doctors and Barbara watched 
silently. She was crying quietly; 
too late now. But he couldn’t 
hate her. 

/^BEYING AN impulse, he 
reached behind the little row 
of books and pulled out what he 
saw with a shock was Volume 
P. 

“Who hid this here?” he de- 
manded. “I’ve been looking for 
it.” 

“Don’t you remember, Jim?” 
asked a doctor gently. “You 
pushed it back there the last 
time. Now shall we try reading 
some things again?” 

The sense of strangeness deep- 
ened until there was no stand- 
ard left to judge the strange- 
ness by. That doctor had a 
cursed familiar way of talking 
to the director of a city, even 
an arrested director, but the di- 
rector opened the book. He 
would show them; there was no 
subject he couldn’t read about. 

He found the place he thought 
they wanted and began to read 
aloud, “Pain, the Ultimate,” but 
all that followed was “see Con- 
ditioning.” 

GALAXY 



“No, Jim. Turn further back. 
Let’s try again Where we were 
last time. Do you remember?” 

Ahlgren turned pages, sudden- 
ly fearful that something was 
coming that he could not face. 
Paine, Thomas. Lucky man, 
bound up safe in a book. 

“Party, the?” he asked, look- 
ing around at the doctors. He 
thought he remembered reading 
this article once; much of it had 
been only a vague jumble of 
nonsense. High-priced encyclo- 
pedia, too. 

“No, we won’t try that one 
today. Turn further back to 
where we were last time. Re- 
member?” 

Ahlgren knew it had to be 
done. For some reason. His hands 
began to tremble as he turned 
the pages. Pe. Pi. He was getting 
closer to something he didn’t 
want to find. 

Po. He dropped the book, but 
made himself pick it up again. 
Barbara gave him a violent nod 
of encouragement. She was stilh 
almost crying over something. 
Women. But this time she was 
here to help him and he was go- 
ing to succeed. 

He turned a few more pages 
and there it was. Something he 
had tried to face before — how 
many times? — and had always 
forgotten about after failure. His 
eyes scanned the clearly printed 
symbols, but something in his 

VOLUME PAA-PYX 



brain fought against interpreting 
them. 

“I can’t read it. It’s all blurry.” 
He had said that before. 

Barbara whispered: “Try, Jim. 
Try hard.” 

Ahlgren stared at the page in 
an immense effort, failed, and 
relaxed for a moment. The title 
of the article suddenly leaped 
into focus for him: 

POSSEMANIA 

TJE HELD up the book and 
began to read aloud in a 
quavery voice: “ — from the 
Latin, posse power, plus mania. 
Of all mental diseases doubtless 
the most evil, in terms of the 
total suffering inflicted upon 
humanity throughout history; 
and one of the most resistant to 
even modern therapy.” 

Why had they wanted him to 
read this? Why had it been diffi- 
cult? An awful idea loomed on 
the horizon . 

“ “Unique among diseases in 
that its effects are put to practi- 
cal use by society, it in fact forms 
the basis of modern government 
fsee Party, the).’ ” 

Ahlgren faltered and looked 
around him uncertainly. He felt 
sweat beginning to bead his fore- 
head. The article went on to 
great length, but he flipped pages 
rapidly back to find Party, the. 

He skimmed rapidly through 



98 



99 



a few paragraphs, then read 
aloud in an impersonal, shrill, 
hurried tone: “ ‘Those with this 
abnormal lust for power over 
ethers generally find means to 
satisfy it in any society; ours is 
the first to maintain effective 
control over its members who are 
so afflicted. Now, the victims of 
the disease are necessarily de- 
tected during the compulsory an- 
nual psychological examination. 
If immediate therapy fails to 
effect a cure, as it usually does, 
mental Conditioning is applied 
to initiate or strengthen the de- 
lusions, welcomed by the patient, 
that the Party has the rest of 
the citizenry at its mercy and — ’ ” 

“Take your time, Jim.” 

“ ‘ — and that — that Con- 
ditioning is a painful and often 
crippling punishment employed 
by the Party itself, to erase 
thoughts of political opposition. 

The world was turning under 
Ahlgren. He forced himself to 
read on slowly and sanely. Could 
this be truth? 

“ ‘Following what is now to 
him the only practical course, the 
victim is guided to apply for 
Party membership as those found 
to be compulsive rebels and/or 
punishment-seekers are . shuttled 
to the complementary organiza- 
tion (see Underground, the). He 
is of course invariably accepted 
and assigned, depending on his 
skills, to the Administration or 



the Political Police (see Pol- 
Pol).’” 

Again pages fluttered under 
Ahlgren’s fingers. PolPol. 

“ ‘ — stun pistols locked at 
low neural frequencies that pro- 
duce only a tickling sensation, 
to which all Party and Under- 
ground members are Conditioned 
to respond by going into psychic 
paralysis, unless in a situation 
where it would be physically 
dangerous to do so — ’ ” 

Ahlgren skipped from article 
to article, his mind grabbing 
recklessly at the words that had 
been forbidden him. 

“ ‘ — most people generally 
ignore the activities of both Par- 
ty and Underground, except as 
occasional sources of unexpected 
amusement — ’ ” 

“ ‘ — Underground members 
captured by the Party are quick- 
ly turned over to the government 
doctors for Conditioning. They 
are given treatments and sent 
out again to a different area, be- 
lieving themselves rebel couriers 
or escapees. At each capture they 
are tested to see if their disease 
has abated to within the reach of 
therapy — ’ ” 

“ ‘ — the PolPol raid the 
same houses over and over, be- 
ing Conditioned to remember no 
such addresses and to keep no 
records of them. Property own- 
ers are compensated for damage 
incurred. Personal injury in these

GALAXY 



cases is of course extremely rare 
and accidental, when it does oc- 
cur, due to the Conditioning of 
both Party and Underground 
people against it — ’ ” 

“ ‘ — Party members compos- 
ing the Administration perform 
most of our essential government 
functions, being constrained by 
their Conditioning against any 
abuse of power, corruption or 
dishonesty . ’ ” 

A HLGREN felt cold sweat all 
over him. His headache was 
gone, but his throat felt raw. 
How long had he been reading 
aloud? 

“That’s fine, Jim, that’s fine!” 
a doctor said. “Can you go on a 
little further?” 

It took a giant’s effort. Yet it 
was something that must be 
done. 

“ ‘By the interaction of Condi- 
tioning with , the disease, the 
victim is prevented from appre- 
hending the true state of affairs. 
He is, for example, unable to 
read this very article with any 
true comprehension. If read 
aloud to him, it will not make 
sense to his mind; he will in- 
terpret it to suit, the needs of 
the moment, then quickly forget 
it. Indeed, this article, and 
similar writings, are frequently 
used as tests to determine a 
patient’s progress. .’ ” 

Ahlgren’s hand holding the 



book dropped to his side. He 
stood swaying on his feet, utterly 
weary. He only wanted sleep, ob- 
livion, forgetfulness. 

A doctor carefully took the 
book from him, found the place, 
and read: “ ‘When continued 

therapy has brought a Party 
member near the point of cure, 
as is finally possible in about half 
of all cases, a realization of the 
true state of affairs becomes pos- 
sible for the patient’ . That’s 
you now, Jim. You’re over the 
hump. Understand me? You’re 
getting well!” 

Director Ahlgren was weeping 
quietly, as if from weakness and 
exhaustion. He sat down on the 
edge of the treatment table and 
the doctors gathered around him 
and began to fit the attachments 
of the table to him. He helped 
them; he was familiar with the 
process. 

“I think this’ll be the last, Jim. 
We’re going to de-Condition you 
this time. Then one more sub- 
conscious therapy — ” The doc- 
tor’s voice came through speak- 
ers . 

. into the next room, where 
Perkins, Lazar, and Doctor 
Schmidt watched and listened. 

Lazar stared through the one- 
way glass, gripped by vast ela- 
tion. The director’s chair was his! 
The girl in the Treatment Room 
had thrown her arms about Ahl- 
gren; perhaps she regretted that 



VOLUME PAA-PYX 



101 



she had been used against him. 
She should be grateful. It was 
not often that a mere citizen had 
such a chance to help the Party. 

Doctor Schmidt was saying 
something to Lazar. “What?” 

“I said, would you tell me 
what you thought of the material 
the former director read aloud 
just now?” 

Lazar frowned. Why, it had 
been something — unpleasant. 
He turned to Perkins, giving up 
the problem with relief to his 
superior. 

“What he read was a lot of 
subversive nonsense,” Perkins 
rumbled, after a thoughtful 
pause. “It amounted to a con- 
fession of guilt.” 

“I see,” said Doctor Schmidt. 
He looked a little sad. “Thank 
you, gentlemen. Shall we go?” 
Perkins was staring with 
bright and hungry eyes at the 
motionless form of former Di- 
rector Ahlgren on the table. 

“Too bad we have to inflict 
such pain,” he said. 

HE WAS coming out of pleasant 
sleep, and the first thing he did 
was to reach out and find her 
hand. He looked up at her face. 
He remembered now — she d 
said she’d wait ... five years 
before. 

“Was it your idea,” he asked, 
“to help last night yourself?” 
“No, the doctors suggested it. 



darling. -They thought you were 
approaching a crisis . but it’s 
all right now.” 

“Then stop crying,” he told 
her. “Every time I look at you, 
you’re crying. Think I want to 
watch you cry all the time?” But 
she was half laughing, too, so it 
really was all right. 

He lay in peace. Mountains 
had been lifted off him. 

H IS mother was bending over 
him anxiously. He saw there 
was morning light coming into a 
hospital room. 

“Son, are you all right?” 
“I’m fine. Mother. No, no 
pain.” Barbara was still there, 
looking happy. 

His father came in, a little 
older and grayer than he remem- 
bered, shaking his head in the 
familiar way at his mother’s ig- 
norant worry about the supposed 
pain of Conditioning. 

“It was on the Party news just 
now,” his father said, grinning. 
“You were denounced for traitor- 
ous activity yesterday and 
purged last night. The usual ap- 
peal — for the citizenry to treat 
you kindly and not blame your 
new personality for your acts of 
treason. I think we can manage 
that somehow.” 

Jim Ahlgren looked around at 
the three of them. He said softly: 
“I’ve been gone a long time.”

A mos parry, a regional

a few minutes early and was

Barnes arrived. He saw that

soothing small talk before saying, 
“Frank, Sales is beginning to push

tion it to me yet. But I think 
we’d better light a fire under

How many men do you have

“Well, two helping with routine 
work, but I’ve done most of it 
myself, evenings and weekends. 
I didn’t want anybody to know 
too much about it. Mr. Parry, 
I’m worried about it.” 

‘Worried? How do you mean?” 
‘Well — let me show you the 
litter we’ve been testing it on.” 
The pigs were in pens outside 
the lab. Amos had seen figures 
on weight gain and general 
health (the latter was what 
promised to be sensational) but

hadn’t seen the animals for two 
weeks. He eyed the first bunch. 
“How old is that boar pig?” 
“Not quite four months.” 
Amos was no expert, but he’d 
spent many hours on customers’ 
farms and he thought the animal 
looked more mature than that. 
So did the shoats in the same 
pen, though they tended more to 
fat. All of the group had an odd 
look, certainly not normal for 
Yorkshires of their age. He 
thought of wild hogs. “Is it just 
the general health factor?” he 
asked. 

“I don’t think so, Mr. Parry. 
You remember I told you this 
wasn’t actually a hormone.” 

“I know. You wanted to call

“Yes, sir, but I didn’t tell you 
what it really was. Mr. Parry, 
are you familiar with hypnotics? 
Mescaline, especially?” 

“No, I’m not, Frank.” 

“Well, it’s a drug that causes 
strong hallucinations. This is a 
chemical derivative of it.” 

Amos grinned again. “Pipe 
dreams for hogs?” 

He quit grinning as implica- 
tions struck him. If this thing 
didn’t pan out, after the money 
they’d spent and the rumors that 
had seeped out, there’d be some 
nasty questions from Buffalo. 
And if it did, and they began 
selling it . 

“What would it do to human 
beings?” asked Amos. 

Barnes avoided his eyes. 
“That’s one of the things I’m wor- 
ried about,” he said. “I want to 
show you another pig.” 

This one was isolated in its 
own pen, and it looked even 
stranger than its siblings. In the 
first place, its hair was thicker, 
and black. There was an oddness 
in its shape and a vaguely 
familiar sinuousness in the way 
it moved that made Amos skin 
prickle. 

“What’s wrong with it?” he 
asked. 

“It’s healthy except for the 
way it looks and acts.” 

“Same litter and dosage?” 
“Yes, sir — all of them got 



just one dose. The effects seem 
to be permanent.” 

They were leaning over the 
fence and the animal was look- 
ing up at them. There was an 
oddity in its eyes; not intelligence 
exactly, but something unpiglike. 
Abruptly, it stood up on its hind 
legs, putting its forefeet against 
the fence and raising its head 
toward them. It squealed as if 
begging for attention. Amos knew 
that pigs made affectionate pets. 
Drawn to it as well as repelled, 
he reached down and patted it, 
and the squealing stopped. 

It was standing too easily in 
that position, and suddenly Amos 
recognized what was familiar 
about it. He jerked his hand 
away, feeling a strong desire for 
soap and water. “How long’s it 
been this way?” 

“It’s changed fast in the last 
week.” 

Amos looked toward the door- 
way of the lab, just inside of 
which a large black tomcat sat 
watching them. “Is the cat out 
here a lot?” 

Barnes’ eyes went to the cat, 
widened, and turned back to the 
pig. He looked as ill as Amos 
felt. 

W HEN Amos got to his office, 
his sales manager was al- 
ready waiting. His mind only half 
present, Amos sized up the stuf- 
fed briefcase and the wider-than- 



106

necessary smile as he responded 
automatically to the amenities. 
“Just get back?” he asked. 

“Early train. Darned planes 
grounded again.” Detrick looked 
full of energy, though he’d un- 
doubtedly rushed home, shaved, 
showered and changed, and hur- 
ried to the office with no rest. 
He sat down, extracted papers 
from the briefcase, and beamed, 
“Wrote up the Peach Association.” 
He’ll give me the good news 
first, Amos thought. “Fine, fine,” 
he said. “The whole year?” 

“Yep. Got a check from the 
Almond Growers, too. All paid 
up now.” 

“Good,” said Amos, and waited. 
It came. “Say, I was talking to 
Frank Barnes about that new 
hormone he’s got and he seemed 
a little negative about it. When 
do you think we can have it?” 

It was a temptation to answer 
with false optimisms and duck 
the issue for a while, but Amos 
said, “The slowest thing will be 
State and Federal testing and 
registration. I’d say not less than 
a year.” 

Detrick nodded. “Competi- 

tion’s selling more and more stuff 
that’s not registered.” 

“Fly-by-night , outfits and 
they’re always getting caught.” 
Detrick smiled. “Every night 
they fly away with more busi- 
ness.” 

Amos managed a smile. 



though the argument was old and 
weary. “We’ll put it up to Buffalo 
if you want to, Bill. You know I 
can’t okay it myself.” 

Detrick dropped the subject, 
not being a man to beat his head 
against a stone wall if there were 
ways around it, and for the next 
hour Amos had to listen to the 
troubles; competition had cut 
prices on this, upped active in- 
gredients in that, put such and 
such a new product on the 
market (Whelan’s factories and 
warehouses already groaned 
under a crippling diversity of 
products but Sales didn’t feel 
that was their problem) and even 
the credit policies needed revis- 
ing. But the worst of all was a 
fifteen-thousand-dollar claim for 
damage to pear trees, caused by 
a bad batch of Whelan’s arsenical 
insecticide. 

Amos got rid of Detrick with 
a few definite concessions, some 
tentative ones, and some stand- 
offs. He made sure no one was 
waiting to see him and told his 
secretary he didn’t want to be 
bothered before lunch. 

He had a lunch date with a 
customer and dreaded it — it 
meant three or four highballs 
and overeating and an upset 
stomach later. Before then, 
though, he had a few minutes to 
try to get his mind straightened 
out. He mixed a glassful of the 
stuff he was supposed to take 

GALAXY 



about now. The Compleat Ex- 
ecutive, he thought; with physi- 
cian and prescription attached. 
It didn’t seem possible that this 
same body had once breezed 
through anything from football 
to fried potatoes. 

Mechanically, his mind on the 
lab’s pigs, he got a small bag of 
grain- out of a desk drawer. He 
hoped nobody (except his sec- 
retary, of course ) knew he wasted 
time feeding pigeons, but it 
helped his nerves, and he felt he 
had a right to one or two 
eccentricities. 

They were already waiting. 
Some of them knew him and 
didn’t shoo off when he opened 
the window and scattered grain 
on the ledge outside. A few ate 
from his hand. 

It was a crisp day, but the 
sun slanting into the window was 
warm. He leaned there, watching 
the birds — more were circling 
in now — and looking out over 
the industrial part of the city. 
The rude shapes were softened 
by haze and there was nothing 
noisy close by. He could almost 
imagine it as some country land- 
scape. 

He looked at his watch, 
sighed, pulled his head in and 
shut the window. The air condi- 
tioner’s hiss replaced the outside 
sounds. 

Not even imagination could 
get rid of the city for long. 

TH E D R U G 



OING through the outer office, 
'-^he saw that Alice Grant, his 
secretary, already had her lunch 
out on her desk. She was a young 
thirty, not very tall and just in- 
clined to plumpness. She wore 
her blonde hair pulled back into 
a knot that didn’t succeed in 
making her look severe, and her 
features were well-formed and 
regular, if plain. Amos noticed a 
new bruise on one cheek and 
wondered how long she’d stay 
with her sot of a husband. There 
were no children to hold her. 

“I’ll probably be back late,” he 
said. “Anything for this after- 
noon?” 

“Just Jim at two-thirty and the 
union agent at three.” 

The lunch didn’t go too badly, 
lubricated as the customer liked 
it, and Amos was feeling only 
hazily uneasy when he got back. 

A stormy session with his plant 
superintendent jarred him into 
the normal disquiet. Jim Glover 
was furious at having to take 
the fifteen-thousand-dollar claim, 
though it was clearly a factory 
error. He also fought a stubborn 
delaying action before giving 
Amos a well-hedged estimate of 
fifty thousand to equip for the 
new drug. He complained that 
Frank Barnes hadn’t given him 
enough information. 

Amos was still trembling from 
that encounter when the union 
business agent arrived. The lunch 

109 



108 



was beginning to lump up and 
he didn’t spar effectively. Not 
that it made much difference. 
The union was going to have a 
raise or else. By the time he d 
squirmed through that interview, 
then dictated a few letters, it 
was time to go home. 

He hoped his wife would be 
out so he could take some of his 
prescription and relax, but she 
met him at the door with a verbal 
barrage. Their son, nominally a 
resident of the house, had gotten 
ticketed with the college crowd 
for drunken driving and Amos 
was to get it fixed; the Temple- 
tons were coming for the week- 
end; her brother’s boy was 
graduating and thought he might 
accept a position with Amos. 

She paused and studied him. 
“I hope this isn’t one of your 
grumpy evenings. The Ashtons 
are coming for bridge.” 

His control slipped a little and 
he expressed himself pungently 
on Wednesday night bridge, after 
a nightclub party on Tuesday 
and a formless affair at some- 
body’s house on Monday. 

She stared at him without 
compassion or comprehension. 
“Well, they’re all business associ- 
ates of yours. I wonder where 
you think you’d be without a 
wife who was willing to enter- 
tain.” 

He’d been getting a lot of 
that lately; she was squeezing 



the role of Executive’s Wife for 
the last drop of satisfactioa 
Well, since he couldn’t relax 
with his indigestion there was 
only one thing to do. He headed 
for the bar. 

“Now don’t get tipsy before 
dinner,” she called after him. 

He got through the evening 
well enough, doused with mar- 
tinis, and the night that followed 
was no worse than most. 






A t nine the next morning, 
the call he’d been expecting 
from Buffalo came through. 
“Hello, Stu,” he said to the pres- 
ident of the company. 

“Hello, Amos. Still morning 
out there, eh? How’s the family? 
Good. Say, Amos; couple of 
things. This big factory charge. 
Production’s screaming.” 

“It was definitely a bad batch, 
Stu.” 

“Well, that’s it, then. Question 
is, how’d it happen?” 

“Jim Glover says he needs an- 
other control chemist.” 

“Hope you’re not practicing 
false economy out there.” 

“We wanted to hire another 
man, Stu, but Buffalo turned it 
down.” 

“You should have brought it 
to me personally if it was that 
important. It’s going to take a 
big bite out of your year’s profit 
Been able to get your margin up 
any?” 



no 



GALAXY 



Amos didn’t feel up to point- 
ing out that Sales wanted lower 
prices and the union wanted 
higher wages, so that the margin 
would get even worse. He de- 
scribed a couple of minor econo- 
mies he’d been able to find, then 
mentioned the contract with the 
Peach Association. 

“Yes, I heard about that,” 
said the president of the 
company. “Nice piece of busi- 
ness. By the way, how you com- 
ing on that animal hormone?” 
That was the main reason for 
the call, of course. Detrick had 
undoubtedly phoned east and in- 
timated that Amos was dragging 
his feet on a potential bonanza. 
T was going to call you on that, 
Stu. It’ll take a year to test and 
get registered and — ” 

“Amos, I hope you’re not turn- 
ing conservative on us.” 

The message was plain; Amos 
countered automatically. “You 
know me better than that, Stu. 
It’s the Legal Department I’m 
worried about. If they set up a 
lot of roadblocks, we may need 
you to run interference.” 

“You know I’m always right 
behind you, Amos.” 

That’s true, thought Amos as 
he hung up. Right behind me. A 
hell of a place to run interfer- 
ence. 

He knew exactly what to 
expect. If he tried to cut corners, 
the Legal Department would 



scream about proper testing and 
registration. Production would 
say he was pushing Jim Glover 
unreasonably, and everyone who 
could would assume highly moral 
positions astraddle the fence. A 
ton of paperwork would go to 
Buffalo to be distributed among 
fifty desks and expertly stalled. 

Not to mention that this was 
no ordinary product. He realized 
for the first time that the Govern- 
ment might not let him produce 
it, let alone sell it. Even as a 
minute percentage in feeds. If it 
was a narcotic, it could be mis- 
used. 

TTIS BUZZER sounded, and he 
was surprised when Mrs. 
Grant announced Frank Barnes. 
It was out of character for 
Frank not to make a formal 
appointment first. 

One look told Amos what was 
coming. He listened to Frank’s 
resignation with a fraction of his 
mind while the rest of it mused 
upon the purposeful way things 
were converging. 

Barnes stopped talking and 
Amos said mechanically, “You’ve 
been part of the team for a long 
time, Frank. It’s especially awk- 
ward to lose you just now.” It 
was banal, but it didn’t matter; 
he wasn’t going to change the 
man’s mind anjrway. He looked 
closer. The timidity was gone. 
So were the eyeglasses. A fright- 



TH E DRUG 



111 



ening thought struck him. “You’ve 
taken some of that drug.” 

Barnes grinned and handed a 
small vial full of powder across 
the desk, along with a file folder. 
“Last night,” he said. “Between 
frustration with the job and 
curiosity about this stuff, I 
yielded to temptation.” 

Amos took the vial and folder. 
“What are these for?” 

“So you can destroy them if 
you want to. I’ve doctored up 
the lab records to make the whole 
thing look like a false alarm. 
You’re holding all that’s left of 
the whole program.” 

Amos looked for signs of ir- 
rationality and saw none. “Do 
you feel all right?” 

“Better than you can imagine. 
But let me tell you what you’re 
up against. I can at least do that 
for you, Mr. Parry.” 

“Thanks. Don’t you suppose 
you could call me Amos now?” 
“Sure, Amos. First of all, you 
were right about that pig trying 
to imitate the cat. He couldn’t 
do much because he only had a 
pig’s brain to work with.” He 
stopped and grinned, evidently at 
Amos’ expression. “I’ll try to ex- 
plain. What is an animal? 
Physically, I mean?” 

Amos shook his head. “You’ve 
got the floor.” 

“All right. An animal is a 
colony of cells. Different kinds 
of cells form organs and do dif- 



ferent things for the colony, but 
each cell has a life of its own, 
too. When it dies a new one of 
the same kind takes over. But 
what regulates the colony? What 
maintains the pattern?” 

Amos waited. 

“Part of it’s automatic replace- 
ment, cell for cell. But beyond 
that there’s a control; and it’s the 
unconscious mind.” He paused 
and studied Amos. “You think 
I’m theorizing. I’m not. That 
drug broke down some barriers, 
and I see all this as you see your 
own fingers moving.” 

Amos remembered the men- 
tion of hallucinations. 

T> ARNES grinned again. “Let’s 
say it’s only one per cent 
awake and walled off from the 
conscious mind. What would hap- 
pen if something removed the 
wall and woke up the other 
ninety-nine per cent?” 

Remembering the pig, it was 
impossible not to feel a cold 
seed of belief. Amos dreaded 
what was coming next; clearly, 
it would be a demonstration. 

Barnes held out his hand, palm 
up. In a few seconds a pink spot 
appeared. It turned red, oozed 
dismayingly, and became a small 
pool of blood. Barnes let it stay 
for a moment, then wiped it off 
with a handkerchief. There was 
no more bleeding. “That’s some- 
thing I can do fast,” he said. “I

opened the pores, directed blood 
to them, then closed them again. 
Amos, do you believe in were- 
wolves?” 

Amos wanted to jump up and 
shout, “No! You’re insane!” but 
he could only sit staring. 

“I could move that thumb 
around to the other side of my 
hand,” Barnes said thoughtfully. 
“I’m still exploring, but I don’t 
think even the bone would take 
too long. You’ll notice I don’t 
need glasses any more.” 

The buzzer buzzed. Amos 
jumped, and from habit an- 
swered. “Bill Detrick and that 
customer are here, Mr. Parry,” 
came Alice Grant’s voice. 

“I — ask them to wait,” he 
managed. 

His mind was a muddle; he 
needed time. ‘Y'ou — Frank — 
will you stay for a few days?” 

“Sure. I’m in no hurry now. 
And while you’re thinking, let 
me give you a few hints. No 
more cripples or disease. No ugly 
people, unless they choose to be. 
And no law.” 

“No — law?” 

“How would you police such a 
world? A man could change his 
face at will, or his fingerprints. 
Even his teeth. Probably he 
could do things I can’t imagine 
yet.” 

The buzzer went again, with 
Mrs. Grant’s subtle urgency. 
Amos ignored it, yet he hardly 



knew when Frank left the room. 

He realized the chemist had 
done him a favor. The selfish 
thing would have been to keep 
the secret and the boon all to 
himself; instead, he’d given Amos 
the choice. 

But what was the choice? 
Suppressing the drug would cost 
him his job. There was no doubt 
about that. 

He was standing with his back 
to the door when he heard it 
open. He turned and faced 
Detrick’s annoyed frown. “Amos, 
we can’t keep this man waiting. 
He’s — ” 

All of Amos’ frustration and 
the new burden coalesced into 
rage. He ran toward Detrick. 
“You baboon-faced huckster!” he 
yelled. “Get out! Get out! I’ll tell 
you when you can come in here!” 
He barely caught his upraised 
fist in time. 

Detrick stood petrified, his 
face ludicrous. Then he came to 
life, ducked out, and pulled the 
door shut behind him. 

Amos waited no longer; if he 
had to decide, he wanted the data 
first-hand. He spread out the file 
Barnes had left him and looked 
through it for dosages. Appar- 
ently it wasn’t critical, so he 
poured a little of the p>owder 
into a tumbler, added water and 
threw it down. There was a mild 
alkaline taste, which he washed 
out of his mouth with more

water. Then he sat down to wait. 

A MONOTONE seemed to be 
rattling off trivia; almost 
faster than he could grasp it, 
even though it was in his head 
and not in his ears ; ‘ Paris

The last thought shocked his 
intellect awake. “Hey!” Intellect 
demanded. “What’s going on 
here?” 

“Oh; you’ve broken through,” 
said Unconscious. “That was fast. 
Fifteen minutes and twenty-

“Hold up a minute!” cried 
Intellect. 

“You want me to stop scan- 
ning?” 

“Is that what you’re doing? 
Scanning what?” 



“Memory banks, of course. 
Don’t you remember the book we 
read three years ago? Human 
brain estimated — ’ Oh, all right; 
I’ll slow down. You could follow 
me better if you’d let me grow 
some permanent direct connec- 
tions.” 

“Am I stopping you?” 

“Well, not you, exactly. I’ll 
show you.” Unconsicous began 
directing the growth of certain 
nerve tendrils in the brain. Amos 
could only follow it vaguely. 

“Fear!” screamed a soimdless 
voice. “Stop!” 

“What was that?” Intellect 
asked, startled. 

“That was Id. He always fights 
any improvements, and I can’t 
override him.” 

“Can 7?” 

“Of course; that’s mainly what 
you’re for. Wait till I get these 
connections finished and you 11 
see the whole setup.” 

“FEAR!” shrieked Id. “STOP! 
NO CHANGE!” 

“SHUT UP!” yelled Intellect 
It was strange being integrated; 
Amos found he was aware on two 
levels simultaneously. While he 
responded normally to his ex- 
ternal environment, a lightning 
inner vision saw everything in 
vastly greater detail. The blink 
of an eye, for instance, was an 
amazing project. Even as com- 
mands flashed out and before 
the muscles started to respond. 



extra blood was rushing into the 
area to nourish the working parts. 
Reports flowed back like battle 
assessments: these three muscles 
were on schedule; this was lag- 
ging; that was pulling too hard. 
An infinitesimal twinge of pain 
marked some minor accident, 
and correction began at once. A 
censor watched the whole opera- 
tion and labeled each incoming 
report: trivial, do not record; 
trivial, do not record; trivial, do 
not record; worth watching, re- 
cord in temporary banks; trivial, 
do not . 

He felt now that he could 
look forward to permanent health, 
and so far he didn’t seem to be 
losing his identity or becoming a 
moral monster (though certain 
previously buried urges — to- 
ward Alice Grant, for instance 
— were now rather embarrass- 
ingly uncovered). He was not, 
like Frank Barnes, inclined to 
slip out of the situation at once. 
He still felt the responsibility 
to make the decision. 

He carried the vial of powder 
and the lab records home with 
him, smuggled them past his 
wife’s garrulity (it didn’t bother 
him now) and hid them. He went 
out with her cheerfully to visit 
some people he didn’t like, and 
found himself amused at them 
instead of annoyed. In general, 
he felt buoyant, and they stayed 
quite late. 



VK/HEN they did get home, an 

” urgent message was waiting 
on the telephone recorder, and 
it jolted him. He grabbed up the 
hat and coat he’d just laid down. 

“What is it?” his wife de- 
manded. 

“I’ve got to go down to the 
plant.” He hesitated; it was hard 
to say the words that were 
charged with personal signifi- 
cance. “The watchman found 
Frank Barnes dead in the 
laboratory.” 

“Who?” 

“Frank Barnes! My chief 
chemist!” 

“Oh.” She looked at him, 
obviously concerned only with 
what effect, if any, it might have 
on her own circumstances. “Why 
do you have to get mixed up in 
it?” 

“I’m the boss, damn it!” He 
left her standing there and ran 
for the garage. 

The police were already at the 
plant when he arrived. Fred’s 
body lay on the floor of his 
office, in a corner behind some 
file cabinets, face up. 

“What was it?” Amos asked 
the man from the coroner’s of- 
fice, dreading the answer he 
expected. 

The answer wasn’t the one he 
expected. “Heart attack.” 

Amos wondered if they were 
mistaken. He looked around the 
office. Things weren’t disarrayed 



THE DRUG 



115 



in any way; it looked as if Frank 
had simply lain down and died. 
“When did you find him?” he 
asked the watchman. 

“A little after one. The door 
was closed and the lights were 
out, but I heard the cat yowling 
in here, so I came in to let it out, 
and saw the body.” 

“Any family?” one of the city 
men asked. 

“No,” said Amos slowly, “he 
lived alone. I guess you might as 
well take him to the . morgue. 
When can I call about the 
autopsy?” 

“Try after lunch.” 

Amos watched them carry 
Frank away. Then he put out 
the lights and closed up the 
laboratory. He told the watch- 
man he’d be around for a while, 
and went to his office to think. 

As nearly as he knew, Frank 
had taken the drug less than 
twenty-four hours before he had. 
Death had come late at night, 
which meant Frank had been 
working overtime. Why? And 
why hadn’t he been able to save 
himself? 

“Not logical,” his unconscious 
stated firmly. “He should have 
felt it coming and made repairs.” 
“This whole thing’s a delu- 
sion,” said Amos dully, aloud. 

“No, it isn’t,” said a peculiar 
voice behind him. 

He whirled and saw the black 
tomcat grinning up at him. He 



gasped, wondering if he were 
completely insane, but in a flash 
understanding came. “Frank!” 
“Well, don’t act so surprised. 
I can tell that you took some 
yourself.” 

“Yes — but how — ” 

“I thought it would be an easy 
life and I want to stay around 
here and watch things for a while. 
There ought to be fun.” 

“But how?” 

“I anesthetized the cat and 
grew a bridge into his skull. It 
took five hours to transfer the 
bulk of my personality. It’s odd, 
but it blended right in with his.” 
“But — your speech!” 

“I’ve made some changes. I’m 
omnivorous now, too, not just 
carnivorous — or will be in a 
few more hours. I can go into 
the hills and live on grass, or 
grow back into a man, or what- 
ever I like.” 

Amos consulted his own in- 
wardness again. “Is this possible? 
Can a human mind be com- 
pressed into a cat’s brain?” 
“Sure,” said Unconscious, “if 
you’re willing to junk all the 
excess.” 

He thought about it. “So you’re 
going to stay around and watch,” 
he said to the cat — no, Frank. 
“An intriguing idea. My family’s 
taken care of, and nobody’ll 
really miss me.” 

“Except Alice Grant,” said 
Frank cattily. “I’ve seen the way 



116 



GALAXY 



F 

you look at her. 'i'he cat part of 
me has, I mean. And she looks 
back, too, when you aren’t watch- 
ing.” 

“Well,” said Amos. “Hm. May- 
be we can do something there 
too.” 

TTIS OWN metamorphosis took 
a lot longer than five hours; 
he had a much bigger job of 
alterations to finish. It was 
nearly two months before he got 
back to the plant. 

He peered in through the 
window at Detrick, who’d in- 
herited Amos’ old office. Detrick 
was chewing out a salesman. 
Amos knew what would be hap- 
pening now; Detrick’s ambitious 
but unsound expansion would 
have gotten the division all 
tangled up. In fact, with his 
sharp new eyes, Amos could read 
part of a letter from Buffalo that 
lay on the desk. It was quite 
critical of Detrick’s margin of 
profit. 

The salesman Detrick had on 
the carpet was a good man, and 
Amos wondered if he was to 
blame for whatever it was about. 



Maybe Detrick was just prepar- 
ing to throw him to the wolves. 
A man could hang on a long 
time like that, shifting the blame 
to his subordinates. 

The salesman was finally ex- 
cused, and Detrick sat alone 
with all the frustration and selfish 
scheming plain on his face. No, 
Amos thought, I’m not going to 
turn this drug loose on the world 
for a while. Not while there are 
people like Detrick around. 

There were no other pigeons 
on the window ledge except 
himself and Alice; the rest had 
stopped coming when Amos dis- 
appeared and the feeding ended. 
For that matter, they tended to 
avoid him and Alice, possibly 
because of the abnormal size, 
especially around the head, and 
the other differences. 

He noticed that Alice was 
changing the color of her feet 
again. Just like a woman, he 
thought fondly. 

“Come on. Pigeon,” he said, 
“let’s go somewhere else. This 
tightwad Detrick isn’t going to 
give us anjrthing to eat.”

AN HONORABLE 
~ DEATH 



F rom the arboretum at 
the far end of the patio to 
the landing stage of the 
transporter itself, the whole 
household was at sixes and 
sevens over the business of pre- 
paring the party for the celebra- 
tion. As usual, Carter was having 
to oversee everything himself, 
otherwise it would not have gone 
right; and this was all the harder 
in that, of late, his enthusiasms 
seemed to have run down some- 
what. He was conscious of a 
vague distaste for life as he 
found it, and all its parts. He 
would be forty-seven this fall. 
Could it be the imminent ap- 
proach of middle age, seeking 
him out even in the quiet back- 



water of this small, suburban 
planet? Whatever it was, things 
were moving even more slowly 
than usual this year. He had not 
even had time to get into his 
costume of a full dress suit 
(19th-20th cent.), with tails, 
which he had chosen as not too 
dramatic, and yet kinder than 
most dress-ups to his tall, rather 
awkward figure — when the 
chime sounded, announcing the 
first arrival. 

Dropping the suit on his bed, 
he went out, cutting across the 
patio toward the gathering room, 
where the landing stage of the 
transporter was — and almost 
ran headlong into one of the 
original native inhabitants of the

planet, standing like a lean and 
bluish post with absolute rigidity 
in the center of the pretty little 
flagstone path. 

“What are you doing here?” 
cried Carter. 

The narrow, indigo, horselike 
face leaned confidentially down 
, toward Carter’s own. And then 
Carter recognized the great mass 
j' of apple blossoms, like a swarm- 
■/i ing of creamy-winged moths, 
held to the inky chest. 

“Oh — ” began Carter, on a 
■ note of fury. Then he threw up 
his hands and took the mass of 
' branches. Peering around the im- 
movable alien and wincing, he 
got a glimpse of his imported 
apple tree. But it was not as 

^ A N HONORABLE DEATH 



badly violated as he had feared. 
“Thank you. Thank you,” he said, 
and waved the native out of the 
way. 

"OUT THE native remained. 

Carter stared — then saw 
that in addition to the apple 
blossoms the thin and hairless 
creature, though no more dressed 
than his kind ever were, had in 
this instance contrived belts, gar- 
lands, and bracelets of native 
flowers for himself. The colors 
and patterns would be arranged 
to convey some special meaning 
— they always did. But right at 
the moment Carter was too an- 
noyed and entirely too rushed to 
figure them out, though he did 

119 






think it a little unusual the na- 
tive should be holding a slim 
shaft of dark wood with a fire- 
hardened point. Hunting was 
most expressly forbidden to the 
natives. 

“Now what?” said Carter. The 
native (a local chief, Carter sud- 
denly recognized) lifted the 
spear and unexpectedly made 
several slow, stately hops, with 
his long legs flicking up and 
down above the scrubbed white 
of the flagstones — like an 
Earthly crane at its mating. “Oh, 
now, don’t tell me you want to 
dance!” 

The native chief ceased his 
movements and went back to be- 
ing a post again, staring out over 
Carter’s head as if at some 
horizon, lost and invisible be- 
yond the iridescences of Carter’s 
dwelling walls. Carter groaned, 
pondered, and glanced anxiously 
ahead toward the gathering 
room, from which he could now 
hear the voice of Ona, already 
greeting the first guest with 
female twitters. 

“All right,” he told the chief. 
“All right — this once. But only 
because it’s Escape Day Anniver- 
sary. And you’ll have to wait 
until after dinner.” 

The native stepped aside and 
became rigid again. Carter hur- 
ried past into the gathering 
room, clutching the apple blos- 
soms. His wife was talking to a 



short, brown-bearded man with 
an ivory-tinted guitar hanging by 
a broad, tan band over one 
red-and-white, checked-shirted 
shoulder. 

“Ramy!” called Carter, hurry- 
ing up to them. The landing 
stage of the transporter, standing 
in the middle of the room, 
chimed again. “Oh, take these 
will you, dear?” He thrust the 
apple blossoms into Ona’s plump, 
bare arms. “The chief. In honor 
of the day. You know how they 
are — and I had to promise he 
could dance after dinner.” She 
stared, her soft, pale face up- 
turned to him. “I couldn’t help 
it.” 

He turned and hurried to the 
landing stage, from the small 
round platform of which were 
now stepping down a short, 
academic, elderly man with 
wispy gray hair and a rather fat, 
button-nosed woman of the same 
age, both wearing the ancient 
Ionian chiton as their costume. 
Carter had warned Ona against 
wearing a chiton, for the very 
reason that these two might show 
up in the same dress. He allowed 
himself a small twinge of satis- 
faction at the thought of her 
ballroom gown as he went hastily 
now to greet them. 

“Doctor!” he said. “Lidi! Here 
you are!” He shook hands with 
the doctor. “Happy Escape Day 
to both of you.” 



120 



GALAXY 



“I was sure we’d be late,” said 
Lidi, holding firmly to the folds 
of her chiton with both hands. 
“The public terminal on Arcturus 
Five was so crowded. And the 
doctor won’t hurry no matter 
what I say — ” She looked over 
at her husband, but he, busy 
greeting Ona, ignored her. 

tT^HE CHIME sounded again 
and two women, quite obvi- 
ously sisters in spite of the fact 
that they were wearing dissimilar 
costumes, appeared on the plat- 
form. One was dressed in a per- 
fectly ordinary everyday kilt 
and tunic — no costume at all. 
The other wore a close, unidenti- 
fiable sort of suit of some gray 
material and made straight for 
Carter. 

“Cart!” she cried, taking one of 
his hands in both of her own and 
pumping it heartily. “Happy 
Escape Day.” She beamed at 
him from a somewhat plain, 
strong-featured face, sharply 
made up. “Ani and I — ” She 
looked around for her sister and 
saw the kilt and tunic already 
drifting in rather dreamlike and 
unconscious fashion toward the 
perambulating bar at the far end 
of the room. “I,” she corrected 
herself hastily, “couldn’t wait to 
get here. Who else is coming?” 

“Just what you see, Totsa,” 
said Carter, indicating those pres- 
ent with a wide-flung hand. “We 



thought a small party this year 
— a little, quiet gathering — ” 
“So nice! And what do you 
think of my costume?” She re- 
volved slowly for his appraisal. 
“Why — good, very good.” 
“Now!” Totsa came back to 
face him. “You can’t guess what 
it is at all.” 

“Of course I can,” said Carter 
heartily. 

“Well, then, what is it?” 

“Oh, well, perhaps I won’t tell 
you, then,” said Carter. 

A small head with wispy gray 
hair intruded into the circle of 
their conversation. “An artistic 
rendering of the space suitings 
worn by those two intrepid 
pioneers who this day, four 
hundred and twenty years ago, 
burst free in their tiny ship from 
the iron grip of Earth’s prisoning 
gravitation?” 

Totsa shouted in triumph. “I 
knew you’d know, Doctor! Trust 
a philosophical researcher to 
catch on. Carter hadn’t the 
slightest notion. Not an inkling!” 
“A host is a host is a host,” 
said Carter. “Excuse me. I’ve got 
to get into my own costume.” 

He went out again and back 
across the patio. The outer air 
felt pleasantly cool on his warm 
face. He hoped that the implica- 
tions of his last remark — that 
he had merely been being polite 
in pretending to be baffled by the 
significance of her costume — 



AN HONORABLE DEATH 



121 



had got across to Totsa, but 
probably it had not. She would 
interpret it as an attempt to 
cover up his failure to recognize 
her costume by being cryptic. 
The rapier was wasted on the 
thick hide of such a woman. And 
to think he once . you had to 
use a club. And the worst of it 
was, he had grasped the meaning 
of her costume immediately. He 
had merely been being playful in 
refusing to admit it . 

The native chief was still 
standing unmoved where Carter 
had left him, still waiting for his 
moment. 

“Get out of the way, can’t 
you?” said Carter irritably, as he 
shouldered by. 

The chief retreated one long 
ostrichlike step until he stood 
half-obscured in the shadow of a 
trellis of roses. Carter went on 
into the bedroom. 

TTIS SUIT was laid out for him 
and he climbed into the 
clumsy garments, his mind busy 
on the schedule of the evening 
ahead. The local star that 
served as this planet’s sun (one 
of the Pleiades, Asterope) 
would be down in an hour and 
a half, but the luminosity of 
the interstellar space in this gal- 
actic region made the sky bright 
for hours after a setting, and the 
fireworks could not possibly go 
on until that died down. 



Carter had designed the set 
piece for the finale himself — a 
vintage space rocket curving up 
from a representation of the 
Earth, into a firmament of stars, 
and changing into a star itself 
as it dwindled. It would be un- 
thinkable to waste this against 
a broad band of glowing rarefied 
matter just above the western 
horizon. 

Accordingly, there was really 
no choice about the schedule. At 
least five hours before the 
thought of fireworks could be 
entertained. Carter, hooking his 
tie into place around his neck 
before a section of his bedroom 
wall set on reflection, computed 
in his head. The cocktail session 
now starting would be good for 
two and a half, possibly three 
hours. He dared not stretch it 
out any longer than that or Ani 
would be sure to get drunk. As 
it was, it would be bad enough 
with a full cocktail session and 
wine with the dinner. But per- 
haps Totsa could keep her under 
control. At any rate — three, 
and an hour and a half for din- 
ner. No matter how it was fig- 
ured, there would be half an hour 
or more to fill in there. 

Well — Carter worked his 
way into his dress coat — he 
could make his usual small 
speech in honor of the occasion. 
And — oh, yes, of course — 
there was the chief. The native 



122 



GALAXY 



dances were actually meaning- 
less, boring things, though Carter 
had been quite interested in 
them at first, but then his was the 
inquiring type of mind. Still, the 
others might find it funny 
enough, or interesting for a single 
performance. 

Buttoning up his coat, he went 
back out across the patio, feeling 
more kindly toward the native 
than he had since the moment of 
his first appearance. Passing him 
this time. Carter thought to stop 
and ask, “Would you like some- 
thing to eat?” 

Remote, shiny, mottled by the 
shadow of the rose leaves, the 
native neither moved nor an- 
swered, and Carter hurried on 
with a distinct feeling of relief. 
He had always made it a point 
to keep some native food on 
hand for just such an emergency 
as this — after all, they got 
hungry, too. But it was a definite 
godsend not to have to stop now, 
when he was so busy, and see 
the stuff properly prepared and 
provided for this uninvited and 
unexpected guest. 

^1 ■'HE HUMANS had all moved 
out of the gathering room by 
the time he reached it and into 
the main lounge with its more 
complete bar and mobile chairs. 
On entering, he saw that they 
had already split up into three 
different and, in a way, inevitable 



groups. His wife and the doctor’s 
were at gossip in a corner; Ramy 
was playing his guitar and sing- 
ing in a low, not unpleasant, 
though hoarse voice to Ani, who 
sat drink in hand, gazing past 
him with a half-smile into the 
changing colors of the wall be- 
hind him. Totsa and the doctor 
were in a discussion at the bar. 
Carter joined them. 

“ — and I’m quite prepared to 
believe it,” the doctor was saying 
in his gentle, precise tones as 
Carter came up. “Well, very 
good. Cart.” He nodded at 
Carter’s costume. 

“You think so?” said Carter, 
feeling his face warm pleasantly. 
“Awkward get-up, but — I don’t 
know, it just struck me this year.” 
He punched for a lime brandy 
and watched with pleasure as the 
bar disgorged the brimming glass 
by his waiting hand. 

“You look armored in it. Cart,” 
Totsa said. 

“Thrice-armed is he — ” 
Carter acknowledged the compli- 
ment and sipped on his glass. 
He glanced at the doctor to see 
if the quotation had registered, 
but the doctor was already lean- 
ing over to receive a refill in his 
own glass. 

“Have you any idea what this 
man’s been telling me?” de- 
manded Totsa, swiveling toward 
Carter. “He insists we’re doomed. 
Literally doomed!” 



AN HONORABLE DEATH 



123 



“I’ve no doubt we are — ” 
began Carter. But before he 
could expand on this agreement 
with the explanation that he 
meant it in the larger sense, she 
wa^ foaming over him in a tidal 
wave of conversation. 

“Well, I don’t pretend to be 
unobjective about it. After all, 
who are we to survive? But 
really — how ridiculous! And 
you back him up just like that, 
blindly, without the slightest no- 
tion of what he’s been talking 
about!” 

“A theory only, Totsa,” said 
the doctor, quite unruffled. 

“I wouldn’t honor ft by even 
calling it a theory!” 

“Perhaps,” said Carter, sipping 
on his lime brandy, “if I knew a 
little more about what you two 
were — ” 

“The point,” said the doctor, 
turning a little, politely, toward 
Carter, “has to do with the ques- 
tion of why, on all these worlds 
we’ve take over, we’ve found no 
other race comparable to our 
own. We may,” he smiled, “of 
course be unique in the universe. 
But this theory supposes that 
any contact between races of 
differing intelligences must in- 
evitably result in the death of 
the inferior race. Consequently, 
if we met our superiors — ” He 
gave a graceful wave of his hand. 

“I imagine it could,” said 
Carter. 



“Ridiculous!” said Totsa. “As 
if we couldn’t just avoid contact 
altogether if we wanted to!” 
“That’s a point,” said Carter. 
“I imagine negotiations — ” 
“We,” said Totsa, “who burst 
the bonds of our Earthly home, 
who have spread out among the 
stars in a scant four hundred 
years, are hardly the type to 
turn up our toes and just die!” 

6iTT’S ALL based on an as- 
-*-sumption. Cart” — the doctor 
put his glass down on the bar 
and clasped his small hands be- 
fore him — “that the racial will 
to live is dependent upon what 
might be called a certain amount 
of emotional self-respect. A race 
of lesser intelligence or scientific 
ability could hardly be a threat 
to us. But a greater race, the 
theory goes, must inevitably gen- 
erate a sort of death-wish in all 
of us. We’re too used to being 
top dog. We must conquer 
or — ” 

“Absolutely nonsense!” said 
Totsa. 

“Well, now, you can’t just con- 
demn the idea offhand like that,” 
Carter said. “Naturally, I can’t 
imagine a human like myself 
ever giving up, either. We’re too 
hard, too wolfish, too much the 
last-ditch fighters. But I imagine 
a theory like this might well hold 
true for other, lesser races.” He 
cleared his throat. “For example. 



¥ 

V I’ve had quite a bit of contact 
I since we came here with the 
I natives which were the dominant 
I life-form on this world in its 
natural state — ” 

“Oh, natives!” snapped Totsa 
scornfully. 

“You might be surprised, 
Totsa!” said Carter, heating up a 
little. An inspiration took hold of 
him. “And, in fact, I’ve arranged 
for you to do just that. I’ve in- 
vited the local native chief to 
dance for us after dinner. You 
might just find it very illumina- 
ting.” 

“Illuminating? How?” pounced 
Totsa. 

“That,” said Carter, putting his 
glass down on the bar with a 
very slight flourish, “I’ll leave 
you to find out for yourself. And 
now, if you don’t mind, I’m going 
to have to make my hostly 
rounds of the other guests.” 

He walked away, glowing with 
a different kind of inner warmth. 
He was smiling as he came up to 
Ramy, who was still singing bal- 
lads and playing his guitar for 
Totsa’s sister. 

“Excellent,” Carter said, clap- 
ping his hands briefly and 
sitting down with them as the 
song ended. “What was that?” 

“Richard the Lion-heart wrote 
ft,” said Ramy hoarsely. He 
turned to the woman. “Another 
drink, Ani?” 

Carter tried to signal the bal- 



ladeer with his eyes, but Ramy 
had already pressed the buttons 
on the table beside their chairs, 
and a little moto unit from the 
bar was already on its way to 
them with the drinks emerging 
from its interior. Carter sighed 
inaudibly and leaned back in his 
chair. He could warn Totsa to 
keep an eye on Ani a little later. 

He accepted another drink 
himself. The sound of voices in 
the room was rising as more 
alcohol was consumed. The only 
quiet one was Ani. She sat, en- 
gaged in the single-minded busi- 
ness of imbibing, and listened to 
the conversation between Ramy 
and himself, as if she was — 
thought Carter suddenly — per- 
haps one step removed, beyond 
some glasslike wall, where the 
real sound and movement of life 
came muted, if at all. The poetry 
of this flash of insight — for 
Carter could think of no other 
way to describe it — operated 
so strongly upon his emotions 
that he completely lost the 
thread of what Ramy was saying 
and was reduced to noncom- 
mittal noises by way of comment. 

I should take up my writing 
again, he thought to himself. 

A S SOON as a convenient 
opportunity presented itself, 
he excused himself and got up. 
He went over to the corner where 
the women were talking.

“ — Earth,” Lidi was saying, 
“the doctor and I will never for- 
get it. Oh, Cart — ” She twisted 
around to him as he sat down in 
a chair opposite. “You must take 
this girl to Earth sometime. 
Really.” 

“Do you think she’s the t?ack- 
to-nature type?” said Carter, with 
a smile. 

“No, stop it!” Lidi turned back 
to Ona. “Make him take you!” 

“I’ve mentioned it to him. 
Several times,” said Ona, putting 
down the glass in her hand with 
a helpless gesture on the end- 
table beside her. 

“Well, you know what they 
say,” smiled Carter. “Everyone 



talks about Earth but nobody 
ever goes there any more.” 

“The doctor and I went. And 
it was memorable. It’s not what 
you see, of course, but the insight 
you bring to it. I’m only five 
generations removed from people 
living right there on the North 
American continent. And the 
doctor had cousins in Turkey 
when he was a boy. Say what 
you like, the true stock thins out 
as generation succeeds genera- 
tion away from the home world.” 
“And it’s not the expense any 
more,” put in Ona. “Everyone’s 
rich nowadays.” 

“Rich! What an uncomfortable 
word!” said Lidi. “You should 



capable, dear. Remember, 
riches are merely the product 
of our science, which is the fruit 
of our own capabilities.” 

“Oh, you know what I mean!” 
said Ona. “The point is. Cart 
won’t go. He just won’t.” 

“I’m a simple man,” Carter 
said. “I have my writing, my 
music, my horticulture, right 
here. I feel no urge to roam — ” 
he stood up — “except to the 
kitchen right now, to check on 
the caterers. If you’ll excuse 
me — 

“But you haven’t given your 
wife an answer about taking her 
to Earth one of these days!” cried 
Lidi. 



“Oh, we’ll go, we’ll go,” said 
Carter, walking off with a good- 
humored wave of his hand. 

As he walked through the west 
sunroom to the dining area and 
the kitchen (homey word!) be- 
yond, his cheerfulness dwindled 
somewhat. It was always a tick- 
lish job handling the caterers, 
now that they were all artists 
doing the work for the love of it 
and not to be controlled by the 
price they were paid. Carter 
would have liked to wash his 
hands of that end of the party 
altogether and just leave them 
to operate on their own. But 
what if he failed to check and 
then something went wrong? It

was his own artistic conscience 
operating, he thought, that would 
not give him any rest. 

rpHE DINING room was al- 

ready set up in classic style 
with long table and individual 
chairs. He passed the gleam of 
its tableware and went on 
through the light-screen into the 
kitchen area. The master caterer 
was just in the process of direct- 
ing his two apprentices to set up 
the heating tray on which the 
whole roast boar, papered and 
gilded, would be kept warm in 
the centerpiece position on the 
table during the meal. He did 
not see Carter enter; and Carter 
himself stopped to admire, with 
a sigh of relief, the boar itself. It 
was a master-work of the carver’s 
art and had been built up so 
skillfully from its component 
chunks of meat that no one could 
have suspected it was not the 
actual animal itself. 

Looking up at this moment, 
the caterer caught sight of him 
and came over to see what he 
wanted. Carter advanced a few 
small, tentative suggestions, but 
the response was so artificially 
polite that after a short while 
Carter was glad to leave him to 
his work. 

Carter wandered back through 
the house without returning di- 
rectly to the lounge. With the 
change of the mood that the 



encounter with the caterer had 
engendered, his earlier feelings of 
distaste with life — a sort of 
melancholy — had come over 
him. He thought of the people 
he had invited almost with dis- 
gust. Twenty years ago, he would 
not have thought himself capable 
of belonging to such a crowd. 
Where were the great friends, 
the true friends, that as a young- 
ster he had intended to acquire? 
Not that it was the fault of those 
in the lounge. They could not 
help being what they were. It 
was the fault of the times, which 
made life too easy for every- 
body; and — yes, he would be 
honest — his own fault, too. 

His wanderings had brought 
him back to the patio. He re- 
membered the chief and peered 
through the light dusk at the 
trellis under the light arch of 
which the native stood. 

Beyond, the house was be- 
tween the semi-enclosed patio 
and the fading band of brilliance 
in the west. Deep shadow lay 
upon the trellis itself and the 
native under it. He was almost 
obscured by it, but a darkly pale, 
vertical line of reflection from 
his upright spear showed that he 
had made no move. A gush of 
emotion burst within Carter. He 
took a single step toward the 
chief, with the abrupt, sponta- 
neous urge to thank him for 
coming and offering to dance. 



But at that moment, through the 
open doorway of his bedroom, 
sounded the small, metallic 
chimes of his bedside clock, an- 
nouncing the twenty-first hour, 
and he turned hastily and 
crossed through the gathering 
room, into the lounge. 

“Hors-d’oeuvres! Hors-d’oeuv- 
res!” he called cheerfully, flinging 
the lounge door wide. “Hors- 
d’oeuvres, everybody! Time to 
come and get it!" 

D inner could not go off 
otherwise than well. Every- 
one was half-tight and hungry. 
Everyone was talkative. Even 
Ani had thrown off her habitual 
introversion and was smiling and 
nodding, quite soberly, anyone 
would swear. She was listening 
to Ona and Lidi talking about 
Lidi’s grown-up son when he had 
been a baby. The doctor was in 
high spirits, and Ramy, having 
gotten his guitar-playing out of 
his system earlier with Ani, was 
ready to be companionable. By 
the time they had finished the 
rum-and-butter pie, everyone 
was in a good mood, and even 
the caterer, peering through a 
momentary transparency of the 
kitchen wall, exchanged a beam 
with Carter. 

Carter glanced at his watch. 
Only twenty minutes more! The 
time had happily flown, and, far 
from having to fill it in, he would 



have to cut his own speech a 
little short. If it were not for the 
fact that he had already an- 
nounced it, he would have elim- 
inated the chief’s dance — no, 
that would not have done, either. 
He had always made a point of 
getting along with the natives of 
this world. “It’s their home, too, 
after all,” he had always said. 

He tinkled on a wine glass 
with a spoon and rose to his 
feet. 

Faces turned toward him and 
conversation came to a reluctant 
halt around the table. He smiled 
at his assembled guests. 

“As you know,” said Carter, 
“it has always been my custom 
at these little gatherings — and 
old customs are the best — to 
say a few — ” he held up a 
disarming hand — “a very few 
words. Tonight I will be even 
briefer than usual.” He stopped 
and took a sip of water from 
the glass before him. 

“On this present occasion, the 
quadricentennial of our great 
race’s Escape into the limitless 
bounds of the universe, I am 
reminded of the far road we 
have come; and the far road — 
undoubtedly — we have yet to 
go. I am thinking at the moment,” 
he smiled, to indicate that what 
he was about to say was merely 
said in good-fellowship, “of a new 
theory expressed by our good 
doctor here tonight. This theory

postulates that when a lesser 
race meets a greater, the lesser 
must inevitably go to the wall. 
And that, since it is pretty 
generally accepted that the laws 
of chance ensure our race eventu- 
ally meeting its superior, we 
must inevitably and eventually 
go to the wall.” 

He paused and warmed them 
again with the tolerance of his 
smile. 

“May I say nonsense! 

“Now, let no one retort that I 
am merely taking refuge in the 
blind attitude that reacts with 
the cry, ‘It can’t happen to us.’ 
Let me say I believe it could 
happen to us, but it won’t. And 
why not? I will answer that with 
one word. Civilization. 

“These overmen — if indeed 
they ever show up — must, even 
as we, be civilized. Civilized. 
Think of what that word means! 
Look at the seven of us here. 
Are we not educated, kindly, 
sympathetic people? And how do 
we treat the races inferior to us 
that we have run across? 

“I’m going to let you answer 
these questions for yourselves, 
because I now invite you to the 
patio for cognac and coffee — 
and to see one of the natives of 
this planet, who has expressed a 
desire to dance for you. Look at 
him as he dances, observe him, 
consider what human gentleness 
and consideration are involved in 



the gesture that includes him in 
this great festival of ours.” Carter 
paused. “And consider one other 
great statement that has echoed 
down the corridors of time — As 
ye have done to others, so shall 
ye be done by!” 

^ARTER sat down, flushed 
and glowing, to applause, 
then rose immediately to pre- 
cede his guests, who were getting 
up to stream toward the patio. 
Walking rapidly, he outdistanced 
them as they passed the gather- 
ing room. 

For a second, as he burst out 
through the patio doorway, his 
eyes were befuddled by the 
sudden darkness. Then his vision 
cleared as the others came 
through the doorway behind him 
and he was able to make out the 
inky shadow of the chief, still 
barely visible under the trellis. 

Leaving Ona to superintend 
the seating arrangements in the 
central courtyard of the patio, 
he hurried toward the trellis. The 
native was there waiting for him. 

“Now,” said Carter, a little 
breathlessly, “it must be a short 
dance, a very short dance.” 

The chief lowered his long, 
narrow head, looking down at 
Carter with what seemed to be 
an aloofness, a sad dignity, and 
suddenly Carter felt uncomfort- 
able. 

“Um — well,” he muttered. 



130 



GALAXY 



^ “you don’t have to cut it too 
■; short.” 

Carter turned and went back 
to the guests. Under Ona’s direc- 
tion, they had seated themselves 
in a small semicircle of chairs, 
with snifter glasses and coffee 
cups. A chair had been left for 
Carter in the middle. He took it 
and accepted a glass of cognac 
from his wife. 

“Now?” asked Totsa, leaning 
toward him. 

“Yes — yes, here he comes,” 
said Carter, and directed their 
attention toward the trellis. 

The lights had been turned up 
around the edge of the court- 
yard, and as the chief advanced 
into them from the darkness, he 
seerqed to step all at once out 
of a wall of night. 

“My,” said Lidi, a little behind 
and to the left of Carter, “isn’t he 
big!” 

“Tall, rather,” said the doctor, 
and coughed dryly at her side. 

The chief came on into the 
center of the lighted courtyard. 
He carried his spear upright in 
one hand before him, the arm 
half-bent at the elbow and half- 
extended, advancing with exag- 
geratedly long steps and on tip- 
toe — in a manner unfortunately 
almost exactly reminiscent of the 
classical husband sneaking home 
late at night. There was a sudden 
titter from Totsa, behind Carter. 
Carter flushed. 

AN HONORABLE DEATH 



Arrived in the center of the 
patio before them, the chief 
halted, probed at the empty air 
with his spear in several direc- 
tions, and began to shuffle about 
with his head bent toward the 
ground. 

Behind Carter, Ramy said 
something in a low voice. There 
was a strangled chuckle and the 
strings of the guitar plinked 
quietly on several idle notes. 

“Please,” said Carter, without 
turning his head. 

There was a pause, some more 
indistinguishable murmuring from 
Ramy, followed again by his low, 
hoarse, and smothered chuckle. 

“Perhaps — ” said Carter, rais- 
ing his voice slightly, “perhaps I 
ought to translate the dance as 
he does it. All these dances are 
stories acted out. This one is 
apparently called ‘An Honorable 
Death.’ ” 

TTE PAUSED to clear his 
throat. No one said anything. 
Out in the center of the patio, 
the chief was standing crouched, 
peering to right and left, his 
neck craned like a chicken’s. 

“You see him now on the trail,” 
Carter went on. “The silver- 
colored flowers on his right arm 
denote the fact that it is a story 
of death that he is dancing. The 
fact that they are below the 
elbow indicates it is an honorable, 
rather than dishonorable, death. 



131 



But the fact that he wears 
nothing at all on the other arm 
below the elbow tells us this is 
the full and only story of the 
dance.” 

Carter found himself forced to 
clear his throat again. He took a 
sip from his snifter glass. 

“As I say,” he continued, “we 
see him now on the trail, alone. 
The chief had now begun to take 
several cautious steps forward, 
and then alternate ones in re- 
treat, with some evidence of ten- 
sion and excitement. He is 
happy at the moment because 
he is on the track of a large 
herd of local game. Watch 
the slope of his spear as he holds 
it in his hand. The more it ap- 
proaches the vertical, the happier 

he is feeling — ” 

Rami murmured again and his 
coarse chuckle rasped on Carters 
ears. It was echoed by a giggle 
from Totsa and even a small, dry 
bark of a laugh from the doctor. 

“ — the happier he is feeling,” 
repeated Carter loudly. “Except 
that, paradoxically, the line of 
the absolute vertical represents 
the deepest tragedy and sorrow. 
In a little paper I did on the 
symbolism behind these dance 
movements, I advanced the 
theory that when a native strikes 
up with his spear from the abso- 
lute vertical position, it is be- 
cause some carnivore too large 
for him to handle has already 



downed him. He’s a dead man. 

The chief had gone into a 
flurry of movement. 

“Ah,” said Carter, on a note of 
satisfaction. The others were 
quiet now. He let his voice roll 
out a little. “He has made his 
kill. He hastens home with it. He 
is very happy. W’hy shouldn t he 
be? He is successful, young, 
strong. His mate, his progeny, his 
home await him. Even now it 
comes into sight.” 

The chief froze. His spear 

point dropped. 

“But what is this?” cried 
Carter, straightening up dramat- 
ically in his chair. “What has 
happened? He sees a stranger in 
the doorway. It is the Man of 
Seven Spears who — this is a 
superstition, of course — ” Carter 
interrupted himself — “who has, 
in addition to liis own spear, six 
other magic spears which will 
fly from him on command and 
kill anything that stands in his 
way. What is this unconquerable 
being doing inside the entrance 
of the chief’s home without being 
invited?” 

The wooden spear point drop- 
ped abruptly, almost to the 
ground. 

“The Man of Seven Spears 
tells him,” said Carter. “He, the 
Man of Seven Spears, has chosen 
to desire the flowers about our 
chief’s house. Therefore he has 
taken the house, killing all within 



132 



galaxy 



it — the mate and the little ones 

— that their touch may be 
cleansed from flowers that are 
his. Everything is now his.” 

^1 ^HE SOFT, tumbling sound of 
liquid being poured filled in 
the second of Carter’s pause. 

“Not too much — ” whispered 
someone. 

“What can our chief do?” said 
Carter sharply. The chief was 
standing rigid with his head bent 
forward and his forehead pressed 
against the perfectly vertical 
shaft of his spear, now held 
upright before him. “He is sick 

— we would say he is weeping, 
in human terms. All that meant 
anything to him is now gone. He 
cannot even revenge himself on 
the Man of Seven Spears, whose 
magic weapons make him invin- 
cible.” Carter, moved by the 
pathos in his own voice, felt his 
throat tighten on the last words. 

“Ona, dear, do you have an 
antacid tablet?” the doctor’s 
wife whispered behind him. 

“He stands where he has stop- 
ped!” cried Carter fiercely. “He 
has no place else to go. The Man 
of Seven Spears ignores him, 
playing with the flowers. For 
eventually, without moving, with- 
out food or drink, he will collapse 
and die, as all of the Man of 
Seven Spears’ enemies have died. 
For one, two, three days he 
stands there in his sorrow; and 



late on the third day the plan 
for revenge he has longed for 
comes to him. He cannot con- 
quer his enemy — but he can 
eternally shame him, so that the 
Man of Seven Spears, in his turn, 
will be forced to die. 

“He goes into the house.” The 
chief was moving again. “The 
Man of Seven Spears sees him 
enter, but pays no attention to 
him, for he is beneath notice. 
And it’s a good thing for our 
chief this is so — or else the Man 
of Seven Spears would call upon 
all his magic weapons and kill 
him on the spot. But he is play- 
ing with his new flowers and pays 
no attention. 

“Carrying his single spear,” 
went on Carter, “the chief goes 
in to the heart of his house. Each 
house has a heart, which is the 
most important place in it. For if 
the heart is destroyed, the house 
dies, and all within it. Having 
come to the heart of the house, 
w/hich is before its hearth fire, the 
chief places his spear butt down 
on the ground and holds it up- 
right in the position of greatest 
grief. He stands there pridefully. 
We can imagine the Man of 
Seven Spears, suddenly realizing 
the shame to be put upon him, 
rushing wildly to interfere. But 
he and all of his seven spears are 
too slow. The chief leaps into 
the air — ” 

Carter checked himself. The 



AN HONORABLE DEATH 



133 





chief was still standing with his 
forehead pressed against the 
spear shaft. 

“He leaps into the air,” re- 
peated Carter, a little louder. 

And at that moment the na- 
tive did bound upward, his long 
legs flailing, to an astonishing | 

height. For a second he seemed 
to float above the tip of his spear, 
still grasping it — and then he 
descended like some great, dark, 
stricken bird, heavily upon the 
patio. The thin shaft trembled 
and shook, upright, above his 
fallen figure. 

ly/fULTIPLE screams exploded

the spear from between the arm 
and side in which he had cleverly 
caught it while falling; and, tak- 
ing it in his other hand, he 
stalked off into the shadows 
toward the house. 

A babble of talk burst out be- 
hind Carter. Over all the other 
voices, Lidi’s rose like a half- 
choked fountain. 

“ — absolutely! Heart failure! 

I never was so upset in my 
life — ” 

“Cart!” said Ona bitterly. 

“Well, Cart,” spoke Totsa 
triumphantly in his ear. “What’s 
the application of all this to what 
you told me earlier?” I 

Carter, who had been sitting 



135 



stunned, exploded roughly out of 
his chair. 

“Oh, don’t be such a fool!” He 
jerked himself away from them 
into the tree-bound shadows be- 
yond the patio. 

Behind him — after some few 
minutes — the voices lowered to 
a less excited level, and then he 
heard a woman’s footsteps ap- 
proaching him in the dark. 

“Cart?” said his wife’s voice 
hesitantly. 

“What?” asked Carter, not 
moving. 

“Aren’t you coming back?” 

“In a while.” 

There was a pause. 

“Cart?” 

“What?” 

“Don’t you think — ” 

“No, I don’t think!” snarled 
Carter. “She can go to bloody 
hell!” 

“But you can’t just call her 
a fool — ” 

“She is a fool! They’re all fools 
— every one of them! I’m a fool, 
too, but I’m not a stupid damn 
bloody fool like all of them!” 

“Just because of some silly 
native dance!” said Ona, almost 
crying. 

“Silly?” said Carter. “At least 
it’s something. He’s got a dance 
to do. That’s more than the rest 
of them in there have. And it just 
so happens that dance is pretty 
important to him. You’d think 
they might like to learn some- 



thing about that, instead of sit- 
ting back making their stupid 
jokes!” 

His little explosion went off 
into the darkness and fell un- 
answered. 

“Please come back. Cart,” Ona 
said, after a long moment. 

“At least he has something,” 
said Carter. “At least there’s that 
for him.” 

“I just can’t face them if you 
don’t come back.” 

“All right, goddammit,” said 
Carter. “I’ll go back.” 

^^HEY returned in grim fashion 

to the patio. The chair tables 
had been cleared and rearranged 
in a small circle. Ramy was 
singing a song and they were all 
listening politely. 

“Well, Cart, sit down here!” 
invited the doctor heartily as 
Carter and Ona came up, indicat- 
ing the chair between himself 
and Totsa. Carter dropped into 
it. 

“This is one of those old sea 
ballads. Cart,” said Totsa. 

“Oh?” asked Carter, clearing 
his throat. “Is it?*” 

He sat back, punched for a 
drink and listened to the song. It 
echoed out heartily over the 
patio with its refrain of “Haul 
away, Joe!” but he could not 
bring himself to like it. 

Ramy ended and began an- 
other song. Lidi, her old self 



136

again, excused herself a moment 
and trotted back into the house. 

“Are you really thinking of 
taking a trip Earthside — ” the 
doctor began, leaning confiden- 
tially toward Carter — and was 
cut short by an ear-splitting 
scream from within the house. 

Ramy broke off his singing. 
The screams continued and all of 
them scrambled to their feet and 
went crowding toward the house. 

They saw Lidi — just outside 
the dark entrance to the gather- 
ing room — small, fat and stiffly 
standing, and screaming again 
and again, with her head thrown 
back. Almost at her feet lay the 
chief, with the slim shaft of the 
spear sticking up from his body. 
Only, this time, it was actually 
through him. 

The rest flooded around Lidi 
and she was led away, still 
screaming, by the doctor. Every- 
one else gathered in horrified 
fascination about the native 
corpse. The head was twisted on 
one side and Carter could just 
see one dead eye staring up, it 
seemed, at him alone, with a 
gleam of sly and savage triumph. 

“Horrible!” breathed Totsa, 
her lips parted. “Horrible!” 

But Carter was still staring at 
that dead eye. Possibly, the 
thought came to him, the hor- 
rendous happenings of the day 
had sandpapered his perceptions 
to an unusually suspicious aware- 



ness. But just possibly . 

Quietly, and without attracting 
undue attention from the others, 
he slipped past the group and 
into the dimness of the gathering 
room, where the lights had been 
turned off. Easing quietly along 
the wall until he came to the 
windows overlooking the patio, 
he peered out through them. 

A considerable number of the 
inky natives were emerging 
from the greenery of the garden 
and the orchard beyond and ap- 
proaching the house. A long, slim, 
fire-hardened spear gleamed in 
the hand of each. It occurred to 
Carter like a blow that they had 
probably moved into position 
surrounding the house while the 
humans’ attention was all fo- 
cused on the dancing of their 
chief. 

His mind clicking at a rate 
that surprised even him. Carter 
withdrew noiselessly from the 
window and turned about. Be- 
hind him was the transporter, 
bulky in the dimness. As silently 
as the natives outside, he stole 
across the floor and mounted 
onto its platform. The trans- 
porter could move him to any- 
where in the civilized area of 
the Galaxy at a second’s notice. 
And one of the possible destina- 
tions was the emergency room of 
Police Headquarters on Earth it- 
self. Return, with armed men.

could be equally instantaneous. 
Much better this way, thought 
Carter with a clarity he had 
never in his life experienced be- 
fore; much better than giving the 
alarm to the people within, who 
would undoubtedly panic and 
cause a confusion that could get 
them all killed. 

Quietly, operating by feel in 
the darkness. Carter set the 
controls for Police Headquarters. 
He pressed the Send button. 

Nothing happened. 

He stared at the machine in 



the impalpable darkness. A 
darker spot upon the thin 
laquered panel that covered its 
front and matched it to the 
room’s decor caught his eye^ He 
bent down to investigate. 

It was a hole. Something like 
a ritual thrust of a fire-hardened 
wooden spear appeared to have 
gone through the panel and into 
the vitals of the transporter. The 
machine’s delicate mechanism 
was shattered and broken and 
pierced.

FORECAST 

April's a triple-treat month for us, with a line-up that includes Fritz 
Leiber, J. T. McIntosh and Theodore Sturgeon ... not to mention half a 
dozen or so other top-ranking science-fiction writers who have given us 
stories with excitement and impact. (Sorry, but we can't tell you just now 
who the others are-depends on how the type sets, as alxvays.) 

The Leiber is a beautiful short job. Leiber says we don't have to go to 
the stars for aliens. He says the aliens are right here among us-licking 
their paws and living their secret lives-and he says it in Kreativify for Kafs. 

McIntosh's yarn is 1 Can Do Anything, and that's exactly what his 
hero can do. The trouble starts when he has to prove it . and does. 

Then we come to the Sturgeon— Tandy's Story— and the only thing 
that can be better than being able to tell you this one is coming up in 
April is to be able to tell you (which we can!) that this is only the first of 
many. You'll love Tandy, a perfectly charming little girl who loves to 
build doll-houses. 

But not for dolls. n li 

What else? Well, a great deal else (Poul Anderson, Frederik Pohl, 
Frank Herbert, Mack Reynolds, Jack Vance and just about everybody else 
is in inventory), but as mentioned we can't yet be sure just which. We're 
sure of Willy Ley, of course. And we're sure of the other regular features. 
And we're surest of all that April's a month you shouldn't miss!

SF HAS evolved enormously 
since the early Thirties. Today’s

PFEIFFER’S PROSE is reminis- 
cent of the poetry of Carson’s 
The Sea Around Us. By un- 
failingly choosing the most dra- 
matic and communicative effect, 
his story of the gigantic sweep 
of the evolution of galaxies and 
life is as gripping as a novel. 

“We exist in an enormous near- 
nothingness, a universe which 



just barely falls short of com- 
plete emptiness.” 

“Information contained in a 
set of genes is enormous. Com- 
pared with Nature’s feat of 
cramming messages into DNA 
molecules, engraving the Lord’s 
Prayer on the head of a pin is 
sky writing.” 

And wonder of wonders, “Sex 
appears early in the history of 
life. It has even been observed in 
bacteria.”

GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER 
of N.Y. has gone on record ad- 
vocating bomb shelters for the 
common man. Roshwald’s book 
is an extension of this idea of 
escape into a grave. Although 
the theme has been done to 
death in SF, the subject book is 
a clinical study of the psy- 
chology of the principals in- 
volved in modern push-button 
warfare. 

The nominal hero (no name — 
just Push-Button Officer X127) 
has received training exclusively 
for the purpose of pushing the 
buttons required for retaliation 
against attack. He and three 
other PBX officers are the rea- 
son for “Level 7,” a complex of 
500 souls, 4400 feet underground,

All are buried for life, whether 
or not they are called upon to 
button push, in this safest of all

the adjustment of X127 and his 
male and female companions to 
their strange life has the weird

THE UNPLEASANT PROFES- 
SION OF JONATHAN HOAG 
by Robert A. Heinlein. Gnome 
Press, Hicksville, N.Y., $3.50 

THE TITLE story, a long nov- 
ella from Unknown, vintage 1942, 
should shock present-day Hein- 
lein lovers with a brand of fan- 
tasy-mystery they would never 
associate with him. 

Hoag, though well-heeled, has 
no idea of his profession or day- 
time activity. A doctor tosses 
him out in horror after analyz- 
ing the filth from under his 
fingernails. A husband-wife de- 
tective team, retained by him to 
uncover his alter ego, become 
ensnared in impossible happen- 
ings, the distaff half losing her 
soul in escrow to an organization 
called the Sons of the Bird. They 
walk through mirrors. 

Fantasy always reads silly in 



synopsis, doesn’t it? But Hein- 
lein’s skill makes his ding-dong 
story credible. Several free bo- 
nuses also: “They,” “He Built a 
Crooked House,” “All You Zom- 
bies,” “Our Fair City” and the 
wonderfully titled “The Man 
Who Traveled in Elephants” 
round out this delightful book.

TO STOP by Constantine Fitz- 
Gibbon. W.W. Norton & Co., Inc., 
N.Y., $3.95 



ENGLAND UNDER the heel of 
Russian communism is hardly a 
virgin theme. However, Fitzgib- 
bon is concerned with cause 
rather than effect, with the events 
that might conceivably lead to a 
Russian coup. 

Unfortunately for comfort of 
mind, his logic is based on close- 
fetched possibilities — a general 
election in which almost all 
elected candidates run on an 
Anti-Nuclear-Bomb platform. 
Committed to disarmament, the 
new government must force the 
U. S. to dismantle all air- and 
rocket-bases and evacuate all 
troops. 

Key officials can then unlock 
the Trojan gates, first to a Rus- 
sian Inspectorate, then to police 
forces, called by the government 
to help quell an internal dis- 
turbance. 

As for story plotting, there are 
a romantic triangle, a quadrangle, 
a tragic interracial affair, a homo- 
sexual, a working-stiff nobleman, 
a Jewish banker turned Catholic, 
but not a single individual on 
which to hang reader-identifica- 
tion.

THE STORY OF CHEMISTRY 
by Georg Lockemann. Philo- 
sophical Library, N. Y., $4.75 

A MORE apt title would be 
The History of Chemistry, for 
this is not narrative in style or 
intent. Rather, it is a concen- 
trated encyclopedia of chemical 
events and personae. Some nine 
hundred names stucco its pages, 
each with complete chronology. 

For the average layman, the 
book is a rubble of names and 
dates, but for the specialist or 
information seeker, it is a rich 
vein of lore. 

INVADERS FROM RIGEL by 
Fletcher Pratt. Avalon Books, 
N. Y., $2.95 

EVEN WHEN I first read the 
magazine version as a lad back 
in ’31, the story seemed utterly 



improbable. On rereading, I have 
to revise my estimate utterward. 

Rigellian invaders wipe out 
all but a selected few humans 
by intensive radiation which con- 
verts flesh to metal and turns 
the survivors into wonderfully 
fabricated mechanisms. Machina 
ex deus, sort of. 

But the Rigellians behave with 
unbelievable stupidity and the 
metal humans with their built-in 
stiff upper lips are too flip and 
glib, considering that only forty- 
odd Americans survive the holo- 
caust. 

Pratt’s reputation rests secure 
on much better ground than this 
bog.

By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 

Illustrated by Harrington 



Civilizations must make sense 
somehow. But was this one the 
gaudy, impossible exception? 

A S THE dust drifted clear 
of the ship’s landing skids, 
at least two things became 
obvious ; 

One — although they had 
missed the city (if that’s what it 
was) by miles, they had never- 
theless managed to slam down 
near one of the numerous rural 
estates. 

Two — the landscape would 
be crawling with Zaortian Fuzzy 
Tails for a long while to come. 
They were still pouring out of 
hatches sprung open by the 
crunching impact. 

Kent Cassidy untangled him- 
self from the control column and 
plucked one of the Fuzzy Tails 
from his neck. The creature 
scampered around until it found 
the ruptured hatch, then scur- 
ried through to join the squeal- 
ing zoological exodus. 

144 




I 



“There goes ten thousand 
credits’ worth of cargo,” groaned 
Gene Mason. His stout form 
slumped in dejection before the 
view port. 

Cassidy sniffed the refreshing 
air that was drifting into the 
ship. “Any idea where we are?” 
“After the directional stabil- 
izer blew, we made three blind 
jumps, all in the direction of 
Galactic Center. We could be 
anywhere between Zaort Seven 
and the Far Rim.” 

“Hey, look,” said Cassidy. 

From the hatchway, the sump- 
tuous estate sprawled nearby, its 
many gabled manor closed off be- 
hind a high wire fence. Cassidy 
squinted, but failed to recognize 
the bold, flowing architectural 
style. 

A small, bent figure clung to 
the wire netting of the fence. He 
was shouting at the ship, but his 
excited words were no match 
for the decompression hisses of 
the auxiliary drive. 

“Humanoid?” Mason suggested. 
“Human, I’d say.” Cassidy ges- 
tured toward the gear locker. 
“Better break out the translator.” 
In baggy trousers and sagging 
blouse, the man raced back and 
forth behind the fence — the 
picture of frustrated anger. How- 
ever, large, doleful eyes, comple- 
mented by a bald head and huge, 
pendulous ear lobes, belied his 
furious actions. 



Presently the squeals of the 
Fuzzy Tails trailed off in the 
distance and the auxiliary drive 
quieted with a final sigh. And 
now the native’s shouts rang out 
distinct and loud : 

“Quick! From here get you! 
Shoo! Scram! Or out there I’ll 
come and apart tear you!” 

“It’s English!” Mason ex- 
claimed. 

“Of a sort. Archaic, but under- 
standable. And not at all 
friendly.” 

Mason scratched his blunt 
chin. “Guess we’re not too far 
off the beaten star paths, eh?” 
Cassidy could find no grounds 
for challenging this observation 
as they started down the ladder 
— not until he looked overhead 
and saw three suns shining in 
the same sky. As far as he knew, 
there were no settled trinary 
systems. 

Beyond the fence the native, 
a wisp of a man was still fuming. 
“The hell away from here get! 
You I’m warning — no closer 
come!” 

Mason displayed a half frown. 
“He’s sure a sour cuss.” 

“You stay with the ship,” said 
Cassidy. “I’ll see what’s fouling 
his tubes.” 

B efore Cassidy , reached the 
fence, his pet Fuzzy Tail 
came scampering from behind a 
bush. It clambered up his 

GALAXY 



• trousers and wrapp>ed itself 
around his neck. This encouraged 
the speculation that perhaps the 
shipment of Tails could be 
bartered for repairs to the 
stabilizer — if there was a local 
space technology, and if they 
could corral the animals. 

The native grew even more 
frenzied now as Cassidy drew 
up before him. 

“Trespasser! Back get! My 
property this be! Scram! You I’ll 
kill!” 

The Fuzzy Tail uncoiled it- 
self from around Cassidy’s neck. 
Perching on his shoulder, it 
fussed back at the native in 
chirping, excited tones. It not 
only acted at times as though it 
owned Cassidy, but it also exer- 
cised a personal responsibility 
for his welfare. 

“Quiet!” Cassidy snapped out. 

It caught both the Fuzzy Tail 
and the old man by surprise. The 
animal bounded for cover while 
the native rocked back on his 
heels. 

“Be you not just a — little bit 
afraid?” His eyebrows mounted 
; the wrinkled expanse of his fore- 
head. 

The nearby hedge rustled and 
parted to let through a dark- 
■ haired girl whose tanned skin 
suggested accustomed exp>osure 
to the multiple sunlight. Wearing 
a belted tunic that lacked inches 
of reaching her knees, she con- 

l^THE CHASERS 



fronted the old man calmly. 

“It’s all about what. Papa?” 
she asked, with a trace of an 
amused smile. 

“Trespassers! On our property, 
Riva! The alarm sound! Scat! To 
the woods take! Or a dead duck 
you be!” 

“Now, Papa,” she chided. 
Then, through the fence, “Him 
you musn’t mind. It’s only his 
duty he’s attending to.” 

From the distance, Cassidy 
had suspected the man was of 
Terran descent. Now, with Riva 
in the picture, he was certain 
this world was stocked either by 
intent or accident with true hu- 
mans. 

“We’re from Terra,” he said. 

She frowned. “Ter-ra?” 

“Earth. The original world — ” 

Incomprehension flooded her 
even features. But her confusion 
was only temporary. “Let’s play.” 

It seemed like an altogether 
acceptable suggestion, Cassidy 
thought, eying the attractive girl. 
But he went on, “This is our 
ship and — ” 

“Ship?” Then she chased away 
her puzzlement with a sudden 
smile. “Some nice games I know.” 

There was no space technol- 
ogy on this planet, Cassidy 
decided. They’d be strictly on 
their own as far as repairing the 
directional stabilizer was con- 
cerned. 

By this time Papa, his eyes 



146 



147 



focused afar, had exploded again. 
“Charge!” he roared. “After him! 
Wa-hoo! Away don’t let him get!” 
He was gripping the fence and 
straining toward the field. 

Cassidy turned and saw, in the 
distance, a skimmer vehicle float- 
ing along several feet off the 
ground. In full pursuit was a 
shouting youth who paused oc- 
casionally to seize a rock and 
hurl it at the craft. 

The old man turned toward 
his daughter. “A good chase that 
be. Bet he wins.” 

“Not a chance.” The girl 
frowned. “That be Nedal. Not so 
swift is he. Loses interest too 
quick, he does.” 

She surveyed Cassidy. “Be 
you a chaser?” 

“No, but I could do with a 
couple of stiff shots.” 

This drew Papa’s attention 
back to the matter at hand. 
“Trespassers! The road hit! Scat! 
Some dust kick up!” 

“Quiet!” Cassidy shouted. “Will 
you listen a minute? I — ” 

Two loyal Fuzzy Tails came 
charging up to the fence and 
added their raucous chatter to 
Papa’s screeching diatribe, which 
had continued unchecked despite 
Cassidy’s loud, desperate plea. 

In the next instant, though, it 
seemed that a dam had burst 
overhead. Materializing from no- 
where, at least a ton of water 
poured down on the agile- 



tongued native, the two Fuzzy 
Tails, Riva and Cassidy himself, 
bringing an abrupt end to all the 
commotion. 

The animals streaked for the 
safety of the bushes while Papa 
and the girl dived back through 
the hedge. Bedraggled, Cassidy 
headed for the ship, wondering 
what sort of meteorological quirk 
he had encountered. 

46]VO, SIR,” he said some time 
’ later as he attacked the di- 
rectional selector with pliers and a 
screwdriver, “I don’t like the 
setup. I don’t like it worth a 
damn.” 

Mason traced the power lead 
to the junction box beside the 
hatch. “Maybe they aren’t all like 
that.” 

“In this sort of place, chances 
are that the first people you run 
into are typical. I’m afraid — ” 

“Say!” Mason interrupted, 
staring outside. “Look at this!” 

Cassidy went over to the hatch 
and watched a dozen or so men 
sprinting across the field, their 
voices rising in excited waves. A 
lithe young woman was in full 
flight before them. But she was 
screaming in delight as she 
turned now and then to beckon 
them on. One overtook her and 
brought her down with a waist 
tackle. She rebounded to her 
feet, however, and took off again. 

Two of the pursuers collided 



148 



GALAXY 



and sprawled on the ground. They 
sprang up and tore into each 
other. Unconcerned with the 
personal dispute, the chase 
struck off in a new direction, 
heading toward the ship as it 
paralleled one of the nearby 
fenced-in estates. 

Behind the wire mesh, a burly 
young man came charging down 
the main steps of the manor and 
raced along with the others. 

“That be the way!” he yelled 
encouragement. “Her go get! It’s 
gaining you are! Hurry!” 

He drew up in time to avoid 
crashing into the side fence, then 
stood there watching the chase 
recede in the distance. 

Within a hundred feet of the 
ship, one of the men fell out 
of the group, panting. He squinted 
at the vessel, then crept forward, 
circling to the right. Within arm’s 
reach, he walked back and forth 
alongside the hull, giving it a 
close inspection. Finally he 
paused and fumbled with his 
clothes. 

Cassidy started. “Look what 
he’s doing!” 

“Against the side of the ship, 
too!” said Mason. 

Hearing them, the native 
jerked his head up toward the 
hatch, then backed off for a 
better view. 

“Stinkers!” he yelled, shaking 
his fist. “Out here come and 
fight! Take you both on I can!” 



When they only gaped, he 
whirled and sped off to rejoin 
the chase. 

“You see?” said Cassidy. “Now 
what do you think?” 

“I think we’d better get that 
directional stabilizer working.” 

TT TOOK more than an hour to 
locate the trouble. “The recti- 
fier circuit’s shot,” Cassidy said 
finally. “But maybe we can patch 
it up. Some of the amplifiers I 
suppose we can do without. But 
a hyper-oscillator we’ve got to 
have.” 

“Say, you’re doing it too,” said 
Mason. 

“What?” 

“Talking like the natives.” 
Cassidy looked up. “Guess it’s 
something that grows on you. 
Well, what do we do now?” 
“Maybe the natives can help 
us.” 

“If they don’t even know where 
they’re from, they probably left 
their volts and amps behind too. 
But that’s only an assumption.” 
“In that case,” Mason said with 
a sigh, “there’s only one thing 
left to do — take Riva up on 
her invitation to, ah, play.” 

“Funny,” Cassidy grunted, 
heading for the hatch. 

“I was only joking.” 

“I’m not. If we can get in that 
house, we’ll know for sure whether 
or not they’ve developed elec- 
tronic devices.” 



THE CHASERS 



149 



Halfway across the field, they 
were almost run down by the 
laughing girl and her retinue of 
galloping suitors, if that’s what 
they were. She was a well-pro- 
portioned blonde whose wind- 
frothed tresses suggested a nymph 
in flight. 

At the fence, they were 
confronted by Riva, who smiled 
up at Cassidy and said, “You I 
was just going to come and get. 
Ready to play yet you are?” 

He looked away and cleared 
his throat. “Not quite, Riva. We’d 
like to visit your house.” 

“It’s some interesting games I 
know. Enjoying them you’d 
surely be.” Her smile, revealing 
even teeth that contrasted ruddy 
cheeks, was as persistent as her 
intent on playing. 

Staring at the girl, Cassidy 
wrestled with a pang of wistful 
envy over the Olympian life he 
had witnessed thus far on this 
world. Maybe they were all ir- 
responsible and childlike. But 
was that bad? 

■p^ASON pointed in alarm to- 
ward the meadow in front 
of the next estate. An ominous- 
looking, furry thing, supported 
on six or eight spindly legs, was 
racing across their field of vision. 

“Hurt you he won’t,” the girl 
assured them, noticing their ap- 
prehension. “Nothing to be afraid 
of there is.” 



“What is it?” Cassidy was still 
trying to determine whether it 
was an overgrown spider or a 
dry-land octopus. 

“Look!” Mason exclaimed. “It’s 
on a leash!” 

And Cassidy noticed the thong 
that extended from the creature 
to the human who was running 
along behind it. 

“To Wolruf he belongs,” the 
girl explained. “One of them I 
can get for you too — if you 
want.” 

Her slender hand reached out 
through the fence and tugged at 
Cassidy’s sleeve. “To chase me 
wouldn’t you like?” she asked, 
pouting. 

Glancing behind her, Cassidy 
spotted the girl’s father bearing 
down on them in a sprint that 
was nothing short of phenomenal 
for his age. He began shouting 
with the last few strides and 
was in full lung when he hurled 
himself at the fence. “Git! Out! 
Away! I’ll — ” 

Riva moved back and glanced 
overhead and Papa, seeing some 
hidden significance in her gesture, 
lowered his voice. 

“You I’ll tear into and apart 
I’ll rip!” he went on in a menac- 
ing whisper. “Your limbs I’ll 
scatter like — ” 

“Papa, it’s not afraid of you 
they are.” 

“They’re not?” He was disap- 
pointed.

“The house they want to come 
in and see.” 

He began working up a rage 
again, but caught himself and 
. looked up into his daughter’s 
face. “Mean you — my house 
they want to see?” 

When she nodded Papa seized 
the lowest strand of wire and 
lifted the fence high enough for 
f Cassidy and Mason to crawl 
* under. “Why, arranged it can be, 
I think.” 

, Its architectural prominences 
i rendered shadowless in the tri- 
solar light, the manor was even 
^ more imposing close at hand. Of 
I stone construction, it flaunted 
{ millwork and beams whose rich 
i carvings would have been wel- 
come on any mansion in the 
known Galaxy. 

Mounting the steps. Mason 
^ observed, “Nice little layout 
t they’ve got here.” 

Riva moved closer to Cassidy. 
- “Inside is cozy,” she said behind 
^ a coy smile. “Play we can really 
, in there.” 

; Papa had been at the door for 
j some time, fumbling with the 

i lock. In a burst of impatience, he 
drew off and gave it a solid kick. 
Then he went back and tried 
j rattling the handle. After a while 
j there was a click and it swung 
|; open. 

Cassidy followed him into a 
blaze of iridescent color and un- 
familiar form. The huge, circular 



room was like a vast diorama 
and it was impossible to tell 
exactly where the solid objects 
blended in with the jumbled 
geometric pattern of the wall. 

He walked across a carpet of 
undulant fibers that reached well 
above his ankles. And he tripped 
across a padded, Z-shaped slab 
that protruded from the wall 
but slithered into a U and re- 
tracted as soon as it received the 
burden of his weight. 

Laughing, Riva helped him up 
and he paused for a closer visual 
inspection of his outlandish sur- 
roundings. Objects of weird 
shapes and unguessable purposes 
hung from the ceiling, some 
changing form and size as he 
watched. Scattered about were 
articles of furniture (he guessed) 
that resembled giant starfish sup- 
ported at their centers and ex- 
tremities by coiled springs. Only, 
each arm was shaped like a 
trough that ran into the bowl-like 
central depression of the piece. 

A GLEEFUL scream sounded 
■^behind them and Papa went 
tearing by. With a running leap, 
he landed on an arm of one of 
the starfish. Its supporting spring 
contracted under the weight, then 
catapulted him ceilingward. 
When he came down again, it 
was on an arm of another star- 
fish, then another. 

The fourth collapsed, deposit-

ing him on the floor, and its 
spring went twanging across the 
room. Struggling to his feet, he 
staggered into something resem- 
bling a clothes tree, knocked it 
over and sprawled beside it. 

He roared with delight as he 
snapped the stem of the thing 
across his knee and hurled the 
pieces at the ceiling. They scored 
direct hits on one of the bulky 
objects suspended overhead and 
it came crashing down with a 
twinkling roar amid a shower of 
sparks. 

“Yow-ee!” he exuberated. “So 
much fun I never had!” 

Riva helped him up. “Papa, 
it’s control yourself you must. 
The last time — remember?” 

But he only shook her off and 
went bounding through an arch- 
way. His hectic progress through 
the house was punctuated by 
sounds of crashing destruction. 

“Honestly,” Riva said, spread- 
ing her hands, “what to do with 
him I don’t know.” 

Cassidy continued staring in 
the direction the old man had 
gone. “He’s wrecking the place!” 

“That he is,” she admitted 
sighing. “And such a nice joint it 
be, too.” 

“He’s just plain nuts!” said 
Mason. 

Riva smiled. “But it’s so much 
fun he has.” 

Cassidy moved away to get a 
better view of a silvery gray 



screen set in the wall and flanked 
by twin rows of dials and knobs. 

“You got stereovision, Riva?” 
he asked. 

Mason went over and twisted 
several of the controls until a 
soft light began suffusing the 
screen. 

“Ster-eo-what?” the girl asked. 

“Video, television — pictures 
with sound.” 

Her face brightened. “Pictures 
we got — sounds too. Right in 
that little window.” 

Just then Papa, uninhibited as 
ever, came storming back into 
the room with a lusty “Ya-hoo!” 
He lost his footing and crashed 
against the screen. Sparks shot 
out and the picture that was be- 
ginning to take shape faded into 
obscurity. 

“It that settles. Papa!” Riva 
said, exasperated. “Outside I’m 
going and for what happens to 
you I’m not responsible!” 

At the door, she paused and 
smiled at Cassidy. “It’ll have to 
be out there that we play, but 
no less fun will we have. Put on 
my best cavorting clothes I’m 
going to.” 

Mason turned the knobs again, 
but produced nothing more than 
the smell of burning insulation 
and a few snickers from Papa. 

“At least,” Cassidy observed, 
“they evidently do know some- 
thing about electronics. All we 
have to do now is run down one 



THE CHASERS 



153 



of the technicians and we might 
get the parts we need for the 
stabilizer.” 

i^UTSIDE Mason dropped 
^^down on the steps and sat 
with his shoulders slumping. 
‘‘Damnedest thing I’ve ever 
seen,” he mumbled. 

Cassidy paced to the edge of 
the porch and stared out over 
the field. A monstrous skimmer 
craft appeared in the distance, 
floating over toward what seemed 
to be a pile of trash in front of 
one of the estates. Twin beams 
of crimson light darted from the 
nose of the vehicle and played 
over the mound. In seconds, the 
heap had melted away and the 
skimmer floated on. 

Wolruf was still walking his 
octopus-spider pet. There were 
now two packs of youths out 
chasing girls. And another skim- 
mer car was having no difficulty 
surviving the stone-throwing as- 
sault of not one, but two 
dedicated pursuers. Outside of 
that, Cassidy noted, things ap- 
peared quite normal. 

Mason slapped his thighs and 
rose. “You go see if Riva knows 
how we can contact the author- 
ities. I’m going back and stay 
with the ship.” 

Cassidy watched him crawl 
under the fence, then went 
around the side of the house. 
When he caught sight of the 



girl, she was just disappearing 
into a smaller structure that 
might have been a guest house 
or garage. 

Following, he knocked on the 
door and called out her name 
anxiously. 

“To play are you ready?” 
There was an eager note in her 
voice as it came through the 
panel. “In come on. It’s all set 
I’ll be in a jiffy.” 

He turned the knob, stepped 
half into the room, lurched back 
outside and slammed the door 
behind him. “Riva!” 

The door started to open, then 
closed again as the girl laughed. 
“Oh, all right. Funny you be. It’s 
to play you want, don’t you?” 

He assured her that he did 
and added, “But there’s some- 
thing we have to talk about now, 
Riva.” 

“Talk, talk, talk. And it gets 
you where? Only wastes time, it 
does.” 

A moment later the door 
opened and she stood there 
smiling, with legs apart and 
hands on her hips. But he hardly 
had time to react to the skimpi- 
ness of her halter and skirt. 

“Now,” she urged as she sprang 
up on her toes and kissed him 
full on the lips, “like a chaser 
make! To the races we’re off!” 

With that, she whirled and 
went streaking through the next 
room.

TTE SURVEYED his surround- 
ings. It was an ordinary 
bedroom with conventional fur- 
nishings — perhaps a bit crude 
even for a culture without any 
space technology. But, then, it 
didn’t seem uncharacteristic, 
considering the circumstances. 

Recognizing the contrast be- 
tween this guest house and the 
manor, he frowned as he started 
off in search of the girl. A worri- 
some suspicion dogged his 
thoughts — there had to be sense 
to Riva and her father and this 
sumptuous estate, natives who 
made sport of chasing skimmer 
craft and voluptuous women 
when they weren’t otherwise 
indiscreetly occupied. But what? 

In the kitchen, he discovered 
Riva’s shapely leg protruding 
from behind a cabinet. He sus- 
pected the exposure was not as 
accidental as she wanted him to 
believe. He was certain of that 
when, as he seized her ankle, 
she crawled out laughing. 

Now she stood before him, un- 
smiling and impatient, and her 
slender arms reached out for his 
shoulders. 

“Riva, this is serious!” He 
forced her hands down again. 
“I’m in trouble. I need help.” 

“It’s to help you I’ve been 
trying all along.” 

“I’ve got to get in touch with 
the authorities — your govern- 
ment.” 



She looked blank. 

He simplified it, “Your 
leaders.” 

“Oh, it’s easy that is. There be 
Aline and Clio and Leah and — 
but that Leah! It’s the cake she 
takes! Thirty chasers she led on 
the best drag-out of all. Two 
whole days it lasted!” 

“No, Riva! Not that kind of 
leader. I mean — well, someone 
who get things done. The kind 
who gets behind things and — ” 
“That be Leanc. Behind those 
floating cars he’s getting all the 
time. And how he can throw so 
many rocks I’ll never know!” 

He mussed his hair in frustra- 
tion, then composed himself. 
“How do I get to the city?” 

“That crowded place with all 
the big houses?” When he nod- 
ded, she went on, “It’s never 
been there I have. Now we play?” 
He drew in a hopeless breath. 
“All right. Now we play. You go 
hide.” 

She radiated a warm eagerness 
as she initiated the game all over 
again with a kiss and then went 
sprinting toward the front of the 
house. He watched her disappear 
through the next room, then went 
out the nearest door, heading for 
the fence and his ship beyond. 
It had required no small degree 
of restraint not to go racing off 
after her. 

At the comer of the manor he 
was bowled over bv a shouting

Papa who was in full flight as he 
shot out around a hedge, head- 
ing for the guest house. 

“All your fault it is!” he cried, 
recovering his balance and plung- 
ing on. “You it be who caused 
this! that I’ll remember!” 

Cassidy sat up, arms resting 
on his updrawn knees, and stared 
after the old man. 

“Ow! Rival Ouch!” Papa 
clutched his rear as he neared 
the cottage. “Help! Oh, my ach- 
ing back!” 

C ASSIDY found Mason frozen 
in the shadow of the ship, 
fascinated by another girl chase 
that was in progress nearby. 

The swirl of action swerved 
toward him and Mason tensed, 
shifting from one foot to the 
other. With -the wind pressing 
her clothes in revealing tightness 
about her, the flaxen-haired sprite 
swept past and he lunged for 
her. 

“Mason!” Cassidy shouted. 
“Seemed like a good idea,” 
Mason explained, checking him- 
self. “Wonder what it takes to 
get in on that chase.” 

Cassidy forced a fetching 
thought of Riva out of his mind. 
“What we ought to be wondering 
is how soon we can blast off.” 
“But if we get spaceborne be- 
fore the stabilizer’s working, 
we’ll only be floundering around 
again.” 



Cassidy started for the ladder. 
“There’s one thing we can do — 
patch up the hatches and jump 
over to another spot on this 
planet. Maybe we’ll find some- 
body who’s normal, at least.” 

But Mason caught his arm and 
pointed toward Riva’s estate 
where a skimmer car was now 
parked on the side of the manor 
opposite the guest house. 

“Anybody who can drive one 
of those things,” he suggested, 
“must know something about the 
city and how to get there. Maybe 
he’ll even give us a lift.” 

M ason circled the skimmer 
craft. “It’s a fine piece of 
workmanship,” he said in admira- 
tion. 

“I’ll say,” Cassidy agreed. “If 
we can find out where that was 
made, I’m sure we’ll — ” 

His vision was suddenly cut 
off by a pair of hands that came 
around his head from behind and 
clamped themselves over his 
eyes. If he had any doubt as to 
the identity of their owner, it was 
soon cleared up by a soft voice 
next to his ear; 

“Not right this is. ’It’s chasing 
me you’re supposed to be.” 

“Riva,” he said, facing her, 
“we’d like to meet the person 
who came here iii that skimmer.” 
“Excuses, excuses,” she com- 
plained. “Always something more 
important than a chase it is.”

“Take us to the driver of that 
thing,” Mason prompted. “We — ” 

But he tensed and stared up 
in alarm toward the field. Cas- 
sidy followed his gaze to the 
skimmer vehicle that had earlier 
reduced a pile of trash to noth- 
ing. The craft was just now 
floating up to their ship. 

Its two beams of sizzling red 
light swept over the hull from 
stem to stern, again and again — 
until there was nothing left of 
their ship but incandescent mol- 
ten metal. 

Mason displayed a sickened, 
then resigned expression, thrust 
his hands in his pockets and 
shuffled off toward the field. 

“Getting in on one of those 
chases I think I’ll be,” he said. 

But he paused outside the 
fence, turned to say something, 
then lurched back. “Cassidy! 
Watch out! There’s orte of those 
things!” 

The spider-octopus came into 
view from around the rear of the 
manor and crawled leisurely to- 
ward the guest house. Its body, 
covered with a multitude of eyes 
and an unkempt mat of fuzz, was 



like a coal-black knob perched 
atop hairy stilts. 

Evidently, Cassidy guessed as 
he dived behind a hedge and 
pulled the girl with him, the 
thing had gotten away from its 
master, for it was trailing its 
leash in the dust. 

“It’s hurt you he won’t,” Riva 
assured, quite puzzled over his 
apprehension. “He belongs to — ” 

But Cassidy clamped a hand 
over her mouth. 

The thing reached the guest 
house and made a queer noise in 
front of the door. 

Papa came outside on the 
' double. 

The spider-octopus picked up 
the other end of the thong and 
clamped its braceletlike device 
around the old man’s wrist. 

Grinning, Papa pulled toward 
the gate, straining at the leash. 

Eventually, Cassidy was aware 
of Riva’s smiling, inquisitive face 
in front of his. 

“Play?” she invited. 

And, glancing back at the 
charred remains of his ship, he 
didn’t see why not.

The game of life hadn't quite 
been played out — it still had 
that last little catch in it. 



AUTO- 

DA- 

By DAMON KNIGHT Hi Illustrated by RITTER 



T he king of the world sat 
on a balcony, listening to 
the wind blow around his 
tower. He was drunk. He would 
get drunker still, and then he 
would be sick, and the dogs 
would take care of him. By to- 
morrow afternoon, he would be 
drunk and sick again. 



The dog Roland lay near his 
feet — not quite near enough for 
a kick. The man felt his patient 
gaze like an itch, like the scab 
of an ill-healed wound that he 
could not scratch. 

He glanced down at the dog, 
and saw the grizzled fur above 
the great bloodshot eyes, the 



158 



GALAXY 



hanging dewlaps, the yellow 
teeth. You’re old too, my lad, he 
thought with bitter satisfaction. 
You won’t last another century. 

Dogs and men, they all died 
eventually. The dogs lived five 
hundred years at most; all the 
art of their masters had not been 
able to give them more. But the 
race of dogs was not finished yet; 
the race of man was. 

There were fifty-nine dogs left, 
fifty-eight females, one male. 

There was one man, who could 
call himself the king of the world, 
or the Dalai Lama, or an5d:hing 
he liked, because there was no 
one left to dispute the honor with 
him. No one to talk to; no one 
to remember. 

He was nine thousand and 
some odd hundreds of years old. 
Long ago, in the first fraction of 
that life-span, he had been given 
the organic catalysts that slowed 
down the process of maturity and 
decay almost to zero . not 
quite. At the age of one thousand, 
he had been a man of thirty, at 
two thousand, not quite forty. 
The golden years of full matur- 
ity, full powers, were multiplied 
until it had seemed they would 
never end. 

But the years of decay were 
multiplied too. He had been a 
very old man for over a millen- 
nium. For a thousand years he 
had been dying. 

The dogs kept him alive. They 



tended the machines, served him, 
did the work he was too feeble 
to do. The clever dogs, the faith- 
ful dogs, who would still be alive 
when he was dead. 

He thought with bitter regret 
of his mother. He barely remem- 
bered her; she had died four 
thousand years ago. She could 
have had a daughter, he told him- 
self. She needn’t have left me to 
finish it all alone! 

Perhaps she had tried. He 
thought he remembered that she 
had, that there had been miscar- 
riages. The human strain was 
grown thin and sickly with too 
much care. He himself might 
have been incapable of fathering 
a child, even in his years of 
strength: now it was too late to 
wonder. 

Not like the dogs, he told 
himself somberly. Bred for use, 
not for their own pleasure. I 
never wanted a child when I was 
young. They think of nothing 
else. 

He glanced again at Roland, 
and the dog’s tail thumped 
against the paved floor. 

A knot of pain gathered ab- 
ruptly in the man’s chest. He 
could well imagine the big- 
skulled whelps gathered around 
a fire in the evening, listening 
and looking while the older dogs 
told them of Man. He imagined 
their howls of dismay when they

159 



learned there were no more men 
in the world. 

Century after century . per- 
haps in time they would forget 
there had ever been a race of 
masters. Perhaps their sorrow 
and their loss would turn to a 
vague sadness, a restless urge 
that would drive them as Man’s 
restless seeking had driven him. 
In time they might be great. 

And then all the works of Man 
would be forgotten, lost to eter- 
nity — merely the unimportant 
prelude to the reign of Dog. 

The thought sharpened his 
pain intolerably. He picked up 
the cool tube of the tankard that 
lay on the table beside him and 
drew a long draft. The liquor lay 
heavily in him now. He was going 
to be sick soon. 

He drank again and sucked 
air. He threw the tankard petu- 
lantly over the balustrade. “The 
tankard’s empty,” he said. “Fetch 
me another.” 

Roland was up instantly, wag- 
ging his foolish tail. “Yes, mas- 
ter,” and he was away, the 
tankard clutched in his clumsy 
fingers. 

T>OLAND hurried, ignoring the 
tight band of pain at the 
base of his spine, the complaining 
twinges in his legs. However al- 
tered and bred, the canine body 
was not designed to walk erect. 
You took the gift and you gloried 



in it, but you paid for it. That 
was where old age first struck: 
very old dogs could not stand 
at all, but crept miserably on all 
fours, and the shame of it, Ro- 
land thought, shortened their 
lives. 

The real agony came when 
duty pointed two ways at once; 
all else was of little account. For 
it was one thing to know what 
was best for the master — even 
to understand, in a dim corner of 
the mind, that the master was 
foolish, bitter, jealous, cruel. It 
was another thing to do what was 
best when the master ordered 
otherwise. To obey was joy and 
utter necessity; if the master 
commanded, “Kill me!” — though 
the heart burst with remorse, a 
dog would obey. 

Thus it was joy to fill the tank- 
ard, to serve, and it was pain, 
for the liquor was a slow poison. 
And even this was nothing. There 
was the question of breeding, 
which must be settled soon now. 

Roland was the last male of 
his line. He knew how the others 
had died, one for clumsiness, one 
for a tail too big, others for a 
habit of drooling or for the wrong 
pattern of spots, or simply be- 
cause the master was in a rage. 

But Roland was coming to the 
end of his potent term, and still 
the order to breed had not been 
given. The food machine was still 
dropping, into every morsel of 



160 



GALAXY 



food the dogs ate, the chemical 
agent that kept them sterile. 

The youngest bitch now living 
could not survive more than 
another three hundred years. The 
master, if he were well served, 
could live another thousand. 

As it had many times before, 
Roland’s mind skirted around the 
unvoiced thought of the death 
that would^ be the master’s — 
the lonely, miserable death of an 
outcast cur . 

The dogs must breed. The 
master must give the order. 

He filled the tankard and 
climbed the ramp, panting as the 
strain told on his tired legs. Near 
the doorway stood one of the 
females, waiting for him. She did 
not speak, but there was a ques- 
tion in her anxious eyes. 

Roland shook his head sor- 
rowfully and passed on. 

He put the tankard on the 
little table, laid the drinking tube 
near the master’s hand. The 
master did not appear to see him. 
Slumped among the cushions that 
filled the ebon and argent throne, 
he was gazing out into the sky. 
His bitter face was relaxed, al- 
most peaceful. 

pERHAPS he was thinking of 
the days of his youth, when 
he had roamed the whole world 
and made it his. Perhaps he was 
musing on the greatness his an- 
cestors had known — the globe- 



girdling engines, the mighty 
cities, the depth and daring of 
intellect that had plumbed the 
last secrets of the universe. 

It was a good time; Roland 
dared delay no longer. His heart 
was thudding painfully and his 
throat was dry as he said, “Mas- 
ter, may I speak?” 

The man turned his head 
slowly and his red-rimmed eyes 
focused with surprise on Roland’s 
face. “You back?” he asked heav- 
ily. “Where’s the tankard?” 

“Here, master,” said Roland, 
moving it forward. He waited 
while the man picked up the 
tube and drank. Then he said 
again, “Master, may I speak?” 
The man belched and wiped 
his crusted lips with his hand. 
“All right, what is it?” 

The words tumbled out in con- 
fusion. “Master, I am the last 
male dog. I am near the end of 
my breeding time. If we do not 
breed, you will be left unattend- 
ed when this generation is gone.” 
The man looked at him with 
open hostility in his narrow eyes. 
“Well, breed, then,” he said. 
“Don’t come to me for permission 
to play your dirty little games.” 
Roland’s throat was hot with 
shame. “Master, to breed, I must 
stop the chemical in the food.” 
“Stop it.” 

They were playing a game, 
Roland knew. The master’s mem- 
ory was bad, but not this bad. 



AUTO-DA-FE 



161 



His spirits lifted a little, even 
though he had little hope. If it 
was a game, then it gave the 
master pleasure. He said, “Mas- 
ter, that is done by an automatic 
machine. The control cylinder is 
under your seal.” 

The man stared at him silently 
for a moment, and scrubbed the 
bristles on his chin with one 
splotched and bony hand. “So 
that’s it, is it?” he said. “You 
want me to unlock the cylinder 
so you can make another gen- 
eration of whining, dirty pups.” 
“Yes, master.” 

“You want your whelps to out- 
live me.” 

“No, master!” 

Volumes of unutterable things 
contended in Roland’s mind. He 
felt shame, and horror, and a 
bottomless despair; and at the 
same time he knew that these 
were the things he was intended 
to feel, and he was glad. For a 
dog, however fine, is a dog; a 
man, however base, is a man. 

The master said slowly, “What 
do you want then, Roland?” 

“I want you to live,” said the 
dog, ^nd his voice broke. The 
slow, seldom tears of his race 
coursed down his cheeks. 

The man was silent for a mo- 
ment; then he turned away. “All 
right, bring it here to me,” he 
said. 

THE FEMALE was waiting 



halfway down the ramp; two 
more were behind her. They 
shrank timidly at his approach, 
but their eagerness hel^ them. He 
had no heart to reprimand them 
as they deserved. 

“Did he — ?” 

“Yes!” said Roland. He hurried 
down the ramp, and the females 
followed him. More of them ap- 
peared at each stage of the de- 
scent, some racing ahead of him, 
some clustering behind. The cor- 
ridor was filled with their invol- 
untary yelps and whimpers of 
delight. 

In the food room, a dozen of 
them were waiting for him, 
grouped around a cabinet against 
the far wall. They made a lane 
for him as he approached, and 
carefully, with ceremony, he un- 
locked the case and drew out 
the long cylinder, bound around 
with the wire and wax of the 
master’s seal. 

TN his throne of ebony and sil- 
-*■ ver, the king of the world sat 
and stared at the blank, mean- 
ingless face of the sky. Behind 
him, down the ramp that always 
smelled of dog no matter how it 
was disinfected, he heard the 
faint far echo of canine glee. 

Roland had told them all 
about it, he thought, and paused. 
He felt hurried, cheated of his 
chance of decision. It was neces- 
sary to give them renewed life.

he knew; he would suffer, other- 
wise; he would die painfully and 
alone. 

But he could not prolong his 
life without sparing them also; 



and that was bitter as gall. Bet- 
ter to end all at once, dog and 
man . 

Roland came in, breathless, joy 
in his eyes, holding the cylinder 



carefully in his hands. Wordless, 
he held it out. 

The man took it — a slender 
tube of silvery metal, dotted with 
line-up slots and the sockets of 



other components, and laced 
about with wire and the red wax 
of his own seal. 

How long ago had he done 
that? A hundred, two hundred

years — he had known even then 
that this day must come. 

He glanced at the waiting dog 
— and remembered to his as- 
tonishment that in the days of 
his youth, this dog’s ancestor and 
image had been his dear friend. 
They had been closer than broth- 
ers. He had mourned for years 
after that dog’s death. 

How was it possible that things 
had so changed? He looked at 
Roland again, saw the broad, 
crinkled brow, the worshipful 
eyes. There had been no change 
here. It was incredible, to think 
how faithful that race had been. 
Millennium upon millennium, 
from the dawn of history until 
this day — all the thrown sticks 
retrieved, the households guard- 
ed, the blows accepted without 
anger. The weight of that loyalty 
seemed to him abruptly a crush- 
ing thing. ^Afhat had his kind 
done to deserve it? And how 
could they ever repay? 

The dogs were worthier . 

And would survive. 

In an instant that vision of 
the dog world that had forgotten 
Man came back to him, and his 
guilt receded, twisted upon itself, 
became a slow, bitter wrath. 

He clutched the control cylin- 
der in his hands, as if their feeble 
strength could break it. 

“Master — said Roland fal- 
teringly. “Is anything wrong?” 



“Wrong?” he said. “Not for 
you. Your whelps will inherit the 
Earth. A bunch of dirty, flea- 
bitten, mangy dogs." 



T he words were not enough; 

they came out in the quaver- 
ing, impotent whine of an old 
man. He raised the cylinder, per- 
haps to strike; he did not know 
what he meant to do. 

“Master? You will unseal the 
cylinder?” 

Tears of rage leaked from the 
man’s eye-corners. He said thick- 
ly, “Here’s your damned cylinder. 
Catch it and you can have it!” 
And then the thing was done; 
he had flung out his arm with 
all its waning strength, and the 
cylinder was turning in the air, 
beyond the parapet. 

Roland acted without thought. 
His hands and feet scrabbled on 
the flagstones, his muscles 
bunched in a pattern as old as 
the race; then he felt the smooth 
ivory of the balustrade for an 
instant under his feet. 

He snapped once, vainly, at 
the cylinder as its arc passed 
him. Then there was nothing but 
the rushing wind around him. 

The king of the world sat on 
his throne and listened to the 
bitches howl.

BY MURRAY LEINSTER 

Illustrated by FINLAY 

Suddenly the biggest thing in 



the universe was the very tiniest. 



T here were suns, which 
were nearby, and there 
were stars which were so 
far away that no way of telling 
their distance had any meaning. 
The suns had planets, most of 
which did not matter, but the 
ones that did count had seas and 
continents, and the continents 
had cities and highways and 
spaceports. And people. 

The people paid no attention 
to their insignificance. They 
built ships which went through 
emptiness beyond imagining, 
and they landed upon planets 
and rebuilt them to their own 
liking. Suns flamed terribly, re- 




senting their impertinence, and 
storms swept across the planets 
they preempted, but the people 
built more strongly and were se- 
cure. Everything in the universe 
was bigger or stronger than the 
people, but they ignored the 
fact. They went about the bus- 
inesses they had contrived for 
themselves. 

They were not afraid of any- 
thing until somewhere on a cer- 
tain small planet an infinitesimal 
single molecule changed itself. 

It was one molecule among 
unthinkably many, upon one 
planet of one solar system 
among uncountable star clusters. 
It was not exactly alive, but it 
acted as if it were, in which it 
was like all the important mat- 
ter of the cosmos. It was actually 
a combination of two compli- 
cated substances not too firmly 
joined together. When one of 
the parts changed, it became a 
new molecule. But, like the orig- 
inal one, it was still capable of a 
process called autocatalysis. It 
practiced that process and cata- 
lyzed other molecules into exis- 
tence, which in each case were 
duplicates of itself. Then man- 
kind had to take notice, though 
it ignored flaming suns and mon- 
strous storms and emptiness past 
belief. 

Men called the new molecule 
a virus and gave it a name. They 
called it and its duplicates 



“chlorophage.” And chloro- 
phage was, to people, the most 
terrifying thing in the universe. 

TN A strictly temporary orbit 

around the planet Altaira, 
the Star Queen floated, while 
lift-ships brought passengers and 
cargo up to it. The ship was too 
large to be landed economically 
at an unimportant spaceport 
like Altaira. It was a very mod- 
ern ship and it made the Regu- 
lus-to-Cassim run, which is five 
hundred light-years, in only fifty 
days of Earthtime. 

Now the lift-ships were busy. 
There was an unusual number 
of passengers to board the Star 
Queen at Altaira and an unusual 
number of them were women 
and children. The children tend- 
ed to pudginess and the women 
had the dieted look of the wives 
of well-to-do men. Most of 
them looked red-eyed, as if they 
had been crying. 

One by one the lift-ships 
hooked onto the airlock of the 
Star Queen and delivered pas- 
sengers and cargo to the ship. 
Presently the last of them was 
hooked on, and the last batch of 
passengers came through to the 
liner, and the ship’s doctor 
watched them stream past him. 

His air was negligent, but he 
was actually impatient. Like most 
doctors, Nordenfeld approved of 
lean children and wiry women. 



170 



GALAXY 



They had fewer things wrong 
with them and they responded 
1 better to treatment. Well, he was 
the doctor of the Star Queen and 
he had much authority. He’d ex- 
erted it back on Regulus to insist 
that a shipment of botanical 
specimens for Cassim travel in 
quarantine — to be exact, in the 
ship’s practically unused hos- 
pital compartment — and he was 
prepared to exercise authority 
over the passengers. 

He had a sheaf of health slips 
from the examiners on the 
ground below. There was one 
slip for each passenger. It certi- 
fied that so-and-so had been ex- 
amined and could safely be ad- 
mitted to the Star Queen’s air, 
her four restaurants, her two 
swimming pools, her recreation 
areas and the six levels of pas- 
senger cabins the ship contained. 

He impatiently watched the 
people go by. Health slips or no 
health slips, he looked them 
over. A characteristic gait or a 
typical complexion tint, or even 
a certain lack of hair .luster, 
could tell him things that ground 
physicians might miss. In such a 
case the passenger would go 
back down again. It was not de- 
sirable to have deaths on a liner 
in space. Of course nobody was 
ever refused passage because of 
chlorophage. If it were ever dis- 
covered, the discovery would al- 
ready be too late. But the 



health regulations for space tra- 
vel were very, very strict. 

He looked twice at a young 
woman as she passed. Despite 
applied complexion, there was a 
trace of waxiness in her skin. 
Nordenfeld had never actually 
seen a case of chlorophage. No 
doctor alive ever had. The best 
authorities were those who’d 
been in Patrol ships during the 
quarantine of Kamerun when 
chlorophage was loose on that 
planet. They’d seen beamed-up 
pictures of patients, but not pa- 
tients themselves. The Patrol 
ships stayed in orbit while the 
planet died. Most doctors, and 
Nordenfeld was among them, 
had only seen pictures of the 
screens which showed the pa- 
tients. 

TJE looked sharply at the young 
woman. Then he glanced 
at her hands. They were normal. 
The young woman went on, un- 
aware that for the fraction of an 
instant there had been the pos- 
sibility of the landing of the 
Star Queen on Altaira, and the 
destruction of her space drive, 
and the establishment of a quar- 
antine which, if justified, would 
mean that nobody could ever 
leave Altaira again, but must 
wait there to die. Which would 
not be a long wait. 

A fat man puffed past. The 
gravity on Altaira was some five

per cent under ship-normal and 
he felt the difference at once. 
But the veins at his temples 
were ungorged. Nordenfeld let 
him go by. 

There appeared a white- 
haired, space-tanned man with a 
briefcase under his arm. He saw 
Nordenfeld and lifted a hand in 
greeting. The doctor knew him. 
He stepped aside from the pas- 
sengers and stood there. His 
name was Jensen, and he repre- 
sented a fund which invested 
the surplus money of insurance 
companies. He traveled a great 
deal to check on the business in- 
terests of that organization. 

The doctor grunted, “What’re 
you doing here? I thought you’d 
be on the far side of the cluster.” 
“Oh, I get about,” said Jensen. 
His manner was not quite nor- 
mal. He was tense. “I got here 
two weeks ago on a Q-and-C 
tramp from Regulus. We were a 
ship load of salt meat. There’s 
romance for you! Salt meat by 
the spaceship load!” 

The doctor grunted again. All 
sorts of things moved through 
space, naturally. The Star Queen 
carried a botanical collection 
for a museum and pig-beryllium 
and furs and enzymes and a list 
of items no man could remem- 
ber. He watched the passengers 
go by, automatically counting 
them against the number of 
health slips in his hand. 



“Lots of passengers this trip,” 
said Jensen. 

“Yes,” said the doctor, watch- 
ing a man with a limp. “Why?” 

Jensen shrugged and did not 
answer. He was uneasy, the doc- 
tor noted. He and Jensen were 
as much unlike as two men 
could very well be, but Jensen 
was good company. A ship’s doc- 
tor does not have much congen- 
ial society. 

The file of passengers ended 
abruptly. There was no one in 
the Star Queen’s airlock, but the 
“Connected” lights still burned 
and the doctor could look 
through into the small lift-ship 
from the planet down below. He 
frowned. He fingered the sheaf 
of papers. 

“Unless I missed count,” he 
said annoyedly, “there’s sup- 
posed to be one more passenger. 
I don’t see — ” 

A door opened far back in the 
lift-ship. A small figure appeared. 
It was a little girl perhaps ten 
years old. She was very neatly 
dressed, though not quite the 
way a mother would have done 
it. She wore the carefully com- 
posed expression of a child with 
no adult in charge of her. She 
walked precisely from the lift- 
ship into the Star Queen’s lock. 
The opening closed briskly be- 
hind her. There was the rumb- 
ling of seals making themselves 
tight. The lights flickered for 



172 



GALAXY 



“Disconnect” and then “All 
Clear.” They went out, and the 
lift-ship had pulled away from 
the Star Queen. 

“There’s my missing passen- 
ger,” said the doctor. 

^^HE child looked soberly 
about. She saw him. “Excuse 
me,” she s^id very politely. “Is 
this the way I’m supposed to 
go?” 

“Through that door,” said the 
doctor gruffly. 

“Thank you,” said the little 
girl. She followed his direction. 
She vanished through the door. 
It closed. 

There came a deep, droning 
sound, which was the interplan- 
etary drive of the Star Queen, 
building up that directional 
stress in space which had 
seemed such a triumph when it 
was first contrived. The ship 
swung gently. It would be turn- 
ing out from orbit around Al- 
taira. It swung again. The doctor 
knew that its astrogators were 
feeling for the incredibly exact 
pointing of its nose toward the 
next port which modern com- 
mercial ship operation required. 
An error of fractional seconds of 
arc would mean valuable time 
lost in making port some ' ten 
light-years of distance away. The 
drive droned and droned, build- 
ing up velocity while the ship’s 



aiming was refined and re-refined. 

The drive cut off abruptly. 
Jensen turned white. 

The doctor said impatiently, 
“There’s nothing wrong. Probab- 
ly a message or a report should 
have been beamed down to the 
planet and somebody forgot. 
We’ll go on in a minute.” 

But Jensen stood frozen. He 
was very pale. The interplane- 
tary drive stayed off. Thirty 
seconds. A minute. Jensen 
swallowed audibly. Two min- 
utes. Three. 

The steady, monotonous 
drone began again. It continued 
interminably, as if while it was 
off the ship’s head had swung 
wide of its destination and the 
whole business of lining up for a 
jump in overdrive had to be 
done all over again. 

Then there came that 
“Ping-g-g-g!” and the sensation of 
spiral fall which meant over- 
drive. The droning ceased. 

Jensen breathed again. The 
ship’s doctor looked at him 
sharply. Jensen had been taut. 
Now the tensions had left his 
body, but he looked as if he 
were going to shiver. Instead, he 
mopped a suddenly streaming 
forehead. 

“I think,” said Jensen in a 
strange voice, “that I’ll have a 
drink. Or several. Will you join 
me?” 

Nordenfeld searched his face. 



DOCTOR 



173 



A ship’s doctor has many duties 
in space. Passengers can have 
many things wrong with them, 
and in the absolute isolation of 
overdrive they can be remark- 
ably affected by each other. 

“I’ll be at the fourth-level bar 
in twenty minutes,” said Norden- 
feld. “Can you wait that long?” 

“I probably won’t wait to have 
a drink,” said Jensen. “But I’ll 
be there.” 

The doctor nodded curtly. He 
went away. He made no guesses, 
though he’d just observed the 
new passengers carefully and 
was fully aware of the strict 
health regulations that affect 
space travel. As a physician he 
knew that the most deadly 
thing in the universe was chloro- 
phage and that the planet Kam- 
erun was only one solar system 
away. It had been a stop for the 
Star Queen until four years ago. 
He puzzled over Jensen’s tense- 
ness and the relief he’d dis- 
played when the overdrive field 
came on. But he didn’t guess. 
Chlorophage didn’t enter his 
mind. 

Not until later. 

T¥E SAW the little girl who’d 
come out of the airlock last 
of all the passengers. She sat on 
a sofa as if someone had told 
her to wait there until something 
or other was arranged. Doctor 
Nordenfeld barely glanced at 



her. He’d known Jensen for a 
considerable time. Jensen had 
been a passenger on the Star 
Queen half a dozen times, and 
he shouldn’t have been upset by 
the temporary stoppage of an 
interplanetary drive. Nordenfeld 
divided people into two classes, 
those who were not and those 
who were worth talking to. 
There weren’t many of the lat- 
ter. Jensen was. 

He filed away the health slips. 
Then, thinking of Jensen’s pal- 
lor, he asked what had happened 
to make the Star Queen inter- 
rupt her slow-speed drive away 
from orbit around Altaira. 

The purser told him. But the 
purser was fussily concerned be- 
cause there were so many extra 
passengers from Altaira. He 
might not be able to take on the 
expected number of passengers 
at the next stop-over point. It 
would be bad business to have 
to refuse passengers! It would 
give the space line a bad name. 

Then the air officer stopped 
Nordenfeld as he was about to 
join Jensen in the fourth-level 
bar. It was time for a medical 
inspection of the quarter-acre of 
Banthyan jungle which purified 
and renewed the air of the ship. 
Nordenfeld was expected to 
check the complex ecological 
system of the air room. Specif- 
ically, he was expected to look 
for and identify any patches of 



174 



GALAXY 






colorlessness appearing on the 
foliage of the jungle plants the 
Star Queen carried through 
space. 

The air officer was discreet 
and Nordenfeld was silent about 
the ultimate reason for the in- 
spection. Nobody liked to think 
about it. But if a particular kind 
of bleaching appeared, as if the 
chlorophyll of the leaves were 
being devoured by something too 
small to be seen by an optical 
microscope — why, that would 
be chlorophage. It would also be 
a death sentence for the Star 
Queen and everybody in her. 

But the jungle passed medical 
inspection. The plants grew 
lushly in soil which periodically 
was flushed with hydroponic so- 
lution and then drained away 
again. The UV lamps were 
properly distributed and the dif- 
ferent quarters of the air room 
were alternately lighted and 
darkened. And there were no 
colorless patches. A steady wind 
blew through the air room and 
had its excess moisture and un- 
pleasing smells wrung out before 
it recirculated through the ship. 
Doctor Nordenfeld authorized 
the trimming of some liana-like 
growths which were developing 
woody tissue at the expense of 
leaves. 

The air officer also told him 
about the reason for the turning 
off of the interplanetary drive. 



He considered it a very curious 
happening. 

The doctor left the air room 
and passed the place where the 
little girl — the last passenger 
to board the Star Queen — 
waited patiently for somebody to 
arrange something. Doctor Nor- 
denfeld took a lift to the fourth 
level and went into the bar 
where Jensen should be waiting. 

He was. He had an empty 
glass before him. Nordenfeld sat 
down and dialed for a drink. He 
had an indefinite feeling that 
something was wrong, but he 
couldn’t put his finger on it. 
There are always things going 
wrong for a ship’s doctor, though. 
There are so many demands on 
his patience that he is usually 
short of it. 

Jensen watched him sip at his 
drink. 

“A bad day?” he asked. He’d 
gotten over his own tension. 

l^ORDENFELD shrugged, but 
his scowl deepened. “There 
are a lot of new passengers.” He 
realized that he was trying to 
explain his feelings to himself. 
“They’ll come to me feeling mis- 
erable. I have to tell each one 
that if they feel heavy and de- 
pressed, it may be the gravity- 
constant of the ship, which is 
greater than their home planet. 
If they feel light-headed and 
giddy, it may be because the 



DOCTOR 



175 



gravity-constant of the ship is 
less than they’re used to. But it 
doesn’t make them feel better, so 
they come back for a second 
assurance. I’ll be overwhelmed 
with such complaints within two 
hours.” 

Jensen waited. Then he said 
casually — too casually, “Does 
anybody ever suspect chloro- 
phage?” 

“No,” said Nordenfeld shortly. 
Jensen fidgeted. He sipped. 
Then he said, “What’s the news 
from Kamerun, anyhow?” 

“There isn’t any,” said Nor- 
denfeld. “Naturally! Why ask?” 
“I just wondered,” said Jensen. 
After a moment: “What was the 
last news?” 

“There hasn’t been a message 
from Kamerun in two years,” 
said Nordenfeld curtly. “There’s 
no sign of anything green any- 
where on the planet. It’s con- 
sidered to be — uninhabited.” 
Jensen licked his lips. “That’s 
what I understood. Yes.” 

Nordenfeld drank half his 
drink and said unpleasantly, 
“There were thirty million peo- 
ple on Kamerun when the 
chlorophage appeared. At first 
it was apparently a virus which 
fed on the chlorophyll of plants. 
They died. Then it was discov- 
ered that it could also feed on 
hemoglobin, which is chemically 
close to chlorophyll. Hemoglobin 
is the red coloring matter of the 



blood. When the virus consumed 
it, people began to die. Kamerun 
doctors found that the chloro- 
phage virus was transmitted by 
contact, by inhalation, by inges- 
tion. It traveled as dust particles 
and on the feet of insects, and it 
was in drinking water and the 
air one breathed. The doctors on 
Kamerun warned spaceships off 
and the Patrol put a quarantine 
fleet in orbit around it to keep 
anybody from leaving. And no- 
body left. And everybody died. 
And so did every living thing 
that had chlorophyll in its leaves 
or hemoglobin in its blood, or 
that needed plant or animal tis- 
sues to feed on. There’s not a 
person left alive on Kamerun, 
nor an animal or bird or insect, 
nor a fish nor a tree, or plant or 
weed or blade of grass. There’s 
no longer a quarantine fleet 
there. Nobody’ll go there and 
there’s nobody left to leave. But 
there are beacon satellites to 
record any calls and to warn 
any fool against landing. If the 
chlorophage got loose and was 
carried about by spaceships, it 
could kill the other forty billion 
humans in the galaxy, together 
with every green plant or animal 
with hemoglobin in its blood.” 
“That,” said Jensen, and tried 
to smile, “sounds final.” 

“It isn’t,” Nordenfeld told him. 
“If there’s something in the 
universe which can kill every 



176 



GALAXY 



living thing except its maker, 
that something should be killed. 
There should be research going 
on about the chlorophage. It 
would be deadly dangerous 
work, but it should be done. A 
quarantine won’t stop contagion. 
It can only hinder it. That’s use- 
ful, but not enough.” 

Jensen moistened his lips. 

Nordenfeld said abruptly, 
“I’ve answered your questions. 
Now what’s on your mind and 
what has it to do with chloro- 
phage?” 

Jensen started. He went very 
pale. 

“It’s too late to do anything 
about it,” said Nordenfeld. “It’s 
1 probably nonsense anyhow. But 
I what is it?” 

Jensen stammered out his 
story. It explained why there 
were so many passengers for the 
Star Queen. It even explained 
his departure from Altaira. But 
it was only a rumor — the kind 
of rumor that starts up untrace- 
ably and can never be verified. 
This one was officially denied by 
the Altairan planetary govern- 
: ment. But it was widely believed 

by the sort of people who usually 
^ were well-informed. Those who 
, could sent their families up to 
the Star Queen. And that was 
why Jensen had been tense and 
■worried until the liner had actu- 
ally left Altaira behind. Then he 
felt safe. 



Nordenfeld’s jaw set as Jensen 
told his tale. He made no com- 
ment, but when Jensen was 
through he nodded and went 
away, leaving his drink unfin- 
ished. Jensen couldn’t see his 
face; it was hard as granite. 

And Nordenfeld, the ship’s 
doctor of the Star Queen, went 
into the nearest bathroom and 
was violently sick. It was a re- 
action to what he’d just learned. 

^ I "'HERE WERE stars which 
were so far away that their 
distance didn’t mean anything. 
There were planets beyond 
counting in a single star cluster, 
let alone the galaxy. There were 
comets and gas clouds in space, 
and worlds where there was life, 
and other worlds where life was 
impossible. The quantity of mat- 
ter which was associated with 
life was infinitesimal, and the 
quantity associated with con- 
sciousness — animal life — was 
so much less that the difference 
couldn’t be expressed. But the 
amount of animal life which 
could reason was so minute by 
comparison that the nearest ratio 
would be that of a single atom 
to a sun. Mankind, in fact, was 
the least impressive fraction of 
the smallest category of sub- 
stance in the galaxy. 

But. men did curious things. 

There was the cutting off of 
the Star Queen’s short-distance 



DOCTOR 



177 



drive before she’d gotten well 
away from Altaira. There had 
been a lift-ship locked to the 
liner’s passenger airlock. When 
the last passenger entered the 
big ship — a little girl — the 
airlocks disconnected and the. 
lift-ship pulled swiftly away. 

It was not quite two miles 
from the Star Queen when its 
emergency airlocks opened and 
spacesuited figures plunged out 
of it to emptiness. Simultane- 
ously, the ports of the lift-ship 
glowed and almost immediately 
the whole plating turned cherry- 
red, crimson, and then orange, 
from unlimited heat developed 
within it. 

The lift-ship went incandes- 
cent and ruptured and there was 
a spout of white-hot air, and 
then it turned blue-white and 
puffed itself to nothing in metal- 
lic steam. Where it had been 
there was only shining gas, which 
cooled. Beyond it there were 
figures in spacesuits which tried 
to swim away from it. 

The Star Queen’s control 
room, obviously, saw the happen- 
ing. The lift-ship’s atomic pile 
had flared out of control and 
melted down the ship. It had 
developed something like sixty 
thousand degrees Fahrenheit 
when it ceased to flare. It did 
not blow up; it only vaporized. 
But the process must have be- 
gun within seconds after the 



lift-ship broke contact with the 
Star Queen. 

In automatic reaction, the man 
in - control of the liner cut her 
drive and offered to turn back 
and pick up the spacesuited 
figures in emptiness. The offer 
was declined with almost hyster- 
ical haste. In fact, it was barely 
made before the other lift-ships 
moved in on rescue missions. 
They had waited. And they were 
picking up castaways before the 
Star Queen resumed its merely 
interplanetary drive and the 
process of aiming for a solar 
system some thirty light-years 
away. 

When the liner flicked into 
overdrive, more than half the 
floating figures had been re- 
covered, which was remarkable. 
It was almost as remarkable as 
the flare-up of the lift-ship’s 
atomic pile. One has to know 
exactly what to do to make a 
properly designed atomic pile 
vaporize metal. Somebody had 
known. Somebody had done it. 
And the other lift-ships were 
waiting to pick up the destroyed 
lift-ship’s crew when it hap- 
pened. 

The matter of the lift-ship’s 
destruction was fresh in Norden- 
feld’s mind when Jensen had 
told his story. The two items 
fitted together with an appalling 
completeness. They left little 
doubt or hof)e. 



178 



GALAXY 



l^ORDENFELD consulted the 
^ passenger records and pres- 
ently was engaged in conver- 
sation with the sober-faced, 
composed little girl on a sofa in 
one of the cabin levels of the 
Star Queen. 

“You’re Kathy Brand, I be- 
lieve,” he said matter-of-factly. 
“I understand you’ve been hav- 
ing a rather bad time of it.” 

She seemed to consider. 

“It hasn’t been too bad,” she 
assured him. “At least I’ve been 
seeing new things. I got dread- 
fully tired of seeing the same 
things all the time.” 

“What things?” asked Norden- 
feld. His expression was not 
stern now, though his inner 
sensations were not pleasant. He 
needed to talk to this child, and 
he had learned how to talk to 
children. The secret is to talk 
exactly as to an adult, with 
respect and interest. 

“There weren’t any windows,” 
she explained, “and my father 
couldn’t play with me, and all 
the toys and books were ruined 
by the water. It was dreadfully 
tedious. There weren’t any other 
children, you see. And presently 
there weren’t any grownups but 
my father.” 

Nordenfeld only looked more 
interested. He’d been almost 
sure ever since knowing of the 
lift-ship’s destruction and listen- 
ing to Jensen’s account of the 



rumor the government of Altaira 
denied. He was horribly sure 
now. 

“How long were you in the 
place that hadn’t any windows?” 

“Oh, dreadfully long!” she 
said. “Since I was only six years 
old! Almost half my life!” She 
smiled brightly at him. “I re- 
member looking out of windows 
and even playing out-of-doors, 
but my father and mother said I 
had to live in this place. My 
father talked to me often and 
often. He was very nice. But he 
had to wear that funny suit and 
keep the glass over his face be- 
cause he didn’t live in the room. 
The glass was because he went 
under the water, you know.” 

Nordenfeld asked carefully 
conversational-sounding ques- 
tions. Kathy Brand, now aged 
ten, had been taken by her 
father to live in a big room with- 
out any windows. It hadn’t any 
doors, either. There were plants 
in it, and there were bluish lights 
to shine on the plants, and there 
was a place in one corner where 
there was water. When her 
father came in to talk to her, he 
came up out of the water wear- 
ing the funny suit with glass 
over his face. He went out the 
same way. There was a place in 
the wall where she could look 
out into another room, and at 
first her mother used to come 
and smile at her through the 



DOCTOR 



179 



glass, and she talked into some- 
thing she held in her hand, and 
her voice came inside. But later 
she stopped coming. 

^ I ■'HERE was only one possible 
kind of place which would 
answer Kathy’s description. 
When she was six years old she 
had been put into some univer- 
sity’s aseptic-environment room. 
And she had stayed there. Such 
rooms were designed for biolog- 
ical research. They were built 
and then made sterile of all 
bacterial life and afterward en- 
tered through a tank of antisep- 
tic. Anyone who entered wore a 
suit which was made germ-free 
by its passage through the anti- 
septic, and he did not breathe 
the air of the aseptic room, but 
air which was supplied him 
through a hose, the exhaled-air 
hose also passing under the 
antiseptic outside. No germ or 
microbe or virus could possibly 
get into such a room without 
being bathed in corrosive fluid 
which would kill it. So long as 
there was someone alive outside 
to take care of her, a little girl 
could live there and defy even 
chlorophage. 

And Kathy Brand had done 
it. But, on the other hand, 
Kamerun was the only planet 
where it would be necessary, 
and it was the only world from 
which a father would land his 



small daughter on another plan- 
et’s spaceport. There was no 
doubt. Nordenfeld grimly im- 
agined someone — he would 
have had to be a microbiologist 
even to attempt it — fighting to 
survive and defeat the chloro- 
phage while he kept his little 
girl in an aseptic-environment 
room. 

She explained quite pleasantly 
as Nordenfeld asked more ques- 
tions. There had been other 
people besides her father, but 
for a long time there had been 
only him. And Nordenfeld com- 
puted that somehow she’d been 
kept alive on the dead planet 
Kamerun for four long years. 

Recently, though — very re- 
cently — her father told her 
that they were leaving. Wearing 
his funny, antiseptic-wetted suit, 
he’d enclosed her in a plastic 
bag with a tank attached to it. 
Air flowed from the tank into 
the bag and out through a hose 
that was all wetted inside. She 
breathed quite comfortably. 

It made sense. An air tank 
could be heated and its contents 
sterilized to supply germ-free — 
or virus-free — air. And Kathy’s 
father took an axe and chopped 
away a wall of the room. He 
picked her up, still inside the 
plastic bag, and carried her out. 
There was nobody about. There 
was no grass. There were no 
trees. Nothing moved. 



180 



GALAXY 



Here Kathy’s account was 
vague, but Nordenfeld could 
guess at the strangeness of a 
dead planet, to the child who 
barely remembered anything but 
the walls of an aseptic-environ- 
ment room. 

Her father carried her to a 
little ship, said Kathy, and they 
talked a lot after the ship took 
off. He told her that he was 
taking her to a place where she 
could run about outdoors and 
play, but he had to go some- 
where else. He did mysterious 
things which to Nordenfeld 
meant a most scrupulous decon- 
tamination of a small spaceship’s 
interior and its airlock. Its outer 
surface would reach a tem- 
perature at which no organic 
material could remain uncooked. 

And finally, said Kathy, her 
father had opened a door and 
told her to step out and good-by, 
and she did, and the ship went 
away — her father still wearing 
his funny suit — and people 
came and asked her questions 
she did not understand. 

I^ATHY’S narrative fitted per- 
■*"^fectly into the rumor Jensen 
said circulated among usually 
well-informed people on Altaira. 
They believed, said Jensen, that 
a small spaceship had appeared 
in the sky above Altaira’s space- 
port. It ignored all calls, landed 
swiftly, opened an airlock and 



let someone out, and plunged for 
the sky again. And the story said 
that radar telescopes immedi- 
ately searched for and found the 
ship in space. They trailed it, 
calling vainly for it to identify 
itself, while it drove at top speed 
for Altaira’s sun. 

It reached the sun and dived 
in. 

Nordenfeld reached the skip- 
per on intercom vision-phone. 
Jensen had been called there to 
repeat his tale to the skipper. 

“I’ve talked to the child,” said 
Nordenfeld grimly, “and I’m 
putting her into isolation quar- 
ters in the hospital compartment. 
She’s from Kamerun. She was 
kept in an aseptic-environment 
room at some university or other. 
She says her father looked after 
her. I get an impression of a 
last-ditch fight by microbiologists 
against the chlorophage. They 
lost it. Apparently h°r father 
landed her on Altaira and dived 
into the sun. From her story, he 
took every possible precaution 
to keep her from contagion or 
carrying contagion with her to 
Altaira. Maybe he succeeded. 
There’s no way to tell — yet.” 

The skipper listened in silence. 

Jensen said thinly, “Then the 
story about the landing was 
true.” 

“Yes. The authorities isolated 
her, and then shipped her off on 
the Star Queen. Your well-in- 



DOCTOR

formed friends, Jensen, didn’t 
know what their government was 
going to do!” Nordenfeld paused, 
and said more coldly still, “They 
didn’t handle it right. They 
should have killed her, painlessly 
hilt at once. Her body should 
have been immersed, with every- 
thing that had touched it, in 
full-strength nitric acid. The 
same acid should have saturated 
the place where the ship landed 
and every place she walked. 
Every room she entered, and 
every hall she passed through, 
should have been doused with 
nitric and then burned. It would 
still not have been all one could 
wish. The air she breathed 
couldn’t be recaptured and 
heated white-hot. But the 
chances for Altaira’s population 
to go on living would be im- 
proved. Instead, they isolated 
her and they shipped her off 
with us — and thought they 
were accomplishing something 
by destroying the lift-ship that 
had her in an airtight compart- 
ment until she walked into the 
Star Queen’s lock!” 

The skipper said heavily, “Do 
you think she’s brought chloro- 
phage'on board?” 

“I’ve no idea,” said Norden- 
feld. “If she did, it’s too late to 
do anything but drive the Star 
Queen into the nearest sun . 
No. Before that, one should give 
warning that she was aground 



on Altaira. No ship should land 
there. No ship should take off. 
Altaira should be blocked off 
from the rest of the galaxy like 
Kamerun was. And to the same 
end result.” 

Jensen said unsteadily; 
“There’ll be trouble if this is 
known on the ship. There’ll be 
some unwilling to sacrifice them- 
selves.” 

“Sacrifice?” said Nordenfeld. 
“They’re dead! But before they 
lie down, they can keep every- 
body they care about from dying 
too! Would you want to land 
and have your wife and family 
die of it?” 

The skipper said in the same 
heavy voice, “What are the prob- 
abilities? You say there was an 
effort to keep her from conta- 
gion. What are the odds?” 

“Bad,” said Nordenfeld. “The 
man tried, for the child’s sake. 
But I doubt he managed to 
make a completely aseptic trans- 
fer from the room she lived in 
to the spaceport on Altaira. The 
authorities on Altaira should 
have known it. They should 
have killed her and destroyed 
everything she’d touched. And 
still the odds would have been 
bad!” 

Jensen said, “But you can’t do 
that, Nordenfeld! Not now!” 

“I shall take every measure 
that seems likely to be useful.” 
Then Nordenfeld snapped, “Dam-

nation, man! Do you realize that 
this chlorophage can wipe out the 
human race if it really gets 
loose? Do you think I’ll let sen- 
timent keep me from doing what 
has to be done?” 

He flicked off the vision- 
phone. 

^T^HE Star Queen came out of 
overdrive. Her skipper ar- 
ranged it to be done at the time 
when the largest possible num- 
ber of her passengers and crew 
would be- asleep. Those who 
were awake, of course, felt 
the peculiar inaudible sensation 
which one subjectively trans- 
lated into sound. They felt the 
momentary giddiness which — 
having no natural parallel — 
feels like the sensation of tread- 
ing on a stair-step that isn’t 
there, combined with a twisting 
sensation so it is like a spiral 
fall. The passengers who were 
awake were mostly in the bars, 
and the bartenders explained 
that the ship had shifted over- 
drive generators and there was 
nothing to it. 

Those who were asleep started 
awake, but there was nothing in 
their surroundings to cause 
alarm. Some blinked in the 
darkness of their cabins and per- 
haps turned on the cabin lights, 
but everything seemed normal. 
They turned off the lights again. 
Some babies cried and had to be 



soothed. But there was nothing 
except wakening to alarm any- 
body. Babies went back to sleep 
and mothers returned to their 
beds and — such awakenings 
being customary — went back 
to sleep also. 

It was natural enough. There 
were vague and commonplace 
noises, together making an in- 
definite hum. Fans circulated the 
ship’s purified and reinvigorated 
air. Service motors turned in re- 
mote parts of the hull. Cooks 
and bakers moved about in the 
kitchens. Nobody could tell by 
any physical sensation that the 
Star Queen was not in overdrive, 
except in the control room. 

There the stars could be seen. 
They were unthinkably remote. 
The ship was light-years from 
any place where humans lived. 
She did not drive. Her skipper 
had a family on Cassim. He 
would not land a plague ship 
which might destroy them. The 
executive officer had a small son. 
If his return meant that small 
son’s death as well as his own, 
he -would not return. All through 
the ship, the officers who had to 
know the situation recognized 
that if chlorophage had gotten 
into the Star Queen, the ship 
must not land anywhere. No- 
body could survive. Nobody 
must attempt it. 

So the huge liner hung in the 
emptiness between the stars. 



DOCTOR

waiting until it could be known 
definitely that chlorophage was 
aboard or that with absolute 
certainty it was absent. The 
question was up to Doctor 
Nordenfeld. 

He had isolated himself with 
Kathy in the ship’s hospital 
compartment. Since the ship was 
built it had been used once by a 
grown man who developed 
mumps, and once by an adoles- 
cent boy who developed a raging 
fever which antibiotics stopped. 
Health measures for space travel 
were strict. The hosoital com- 
partment had only been used 
those two times. 

THIS voyage it had been 
used to contain an assort- 
ment of botanical specimens 
from a planet seventy light-years 
beyond Regulus. They were on 
their way to the botanical re- 
search laboratory on Cassim. As 
a routine precaution they’d been 
placed in the hospital, which 
could be fumigated when they 
were taken out. Now the doctor 
had piled them in one side of 
the compartment, which he had 
divided in half with a trans- 
parent plastic sheet. He stayed 
in that side. Kathy occupied the 
other. 

She had some flowering plants 
to look at and admire. They’d 
come from the air room and she 
was delighted with their coloring 



184 



GALAXY 





and beauty. But Doctor Norden- 
feld had put them there as a 
continuing test for chlorophage. 
If Kathy carried that murderous 
virus on her person, the flower- 
ing plants would die of it — 
probably even before she did. 

It was a scrupulously scientific 
test for the deadly stuff. Com- 
pletely sealed off except for a 
circulator to freshen the air she 
breathed, Kathy was settled 
with toys and picture books. It 
was an improvised but well-de- 
signed germproof room. The air 
for Kathy to breathe was steril- 
ized before it reached her. The 
air she had breathed was steril- 
ized as it left her plastic-sided res- 
idence. It should be the perfec- 
tion of protection for the ship — 
if it was not already too late. 

The vision-phone buzzed. Doc- 
tor Nordenfeld stirred in his 
chair and flipped the switch. The 
Star Queen’s skipper looked at 
him out of the screen. 

“I’ve cut the overdrive,” said 
the skipper. “The passengers 
haven’t been told.” 

“Very sensible,” said the 
doctor. 

“When will we know?” 

“That we can go on living? 
When the other possibility is 
exhausted.” 

“Then, how will we know?” 
asked skipper stonily. 

Doctor Nordenfeld ticked off 
the possibilities. He bent down 



a finger. “One, her father took 
great pains. Maybe he did man- 
age an aseptic transfer from a 
germ-free room to Altaira. Kathy 
may not have been exposed to 
the chlorophage. If she hasn’t, 
no bleached spots will show up 
on the air-room foliage or among 
the flowering plants in the room 
with her. Nobody in the crew 
or among the passengers will die.” 
He bent down a second finger. 
“It is probably more likely that 
white spots will appear on the 
plants in the air room and here, 
and people will start to die. That 
will mean Kathy brought conta- 
gion here the instant she arrived, 
and almost certainly that Altaira 
will become like Kamerun — 
uninhabited. In such a case we 
are finished.” 

1"rE BENT down a third finger. 
iX SO likely, but prefer- 

able, white spots may appear on 
the foliage inside the plastic with 
Kathy, but not in the ship’s air 
room. In that case she was ex- 
posed, but the virus was incuba- 
ting when she came on board, 
and only developed and spread 
after she was isolated. Possibly, 
in such a case, we can save the 
passengers and crew, but the 
ship will probably have to be 
melted down in space. It would 
be tricky, but it might be done.” 
The skipper hesitated. “If that 
last happened, she — ” 



186 



GALAXY 



“I will take whatever meas- 
ures are necessary,” said Doctor 
Nordenfeld. “To save your con- 
science, we won’t discuss them. 
They should have been taken on 
Altaira.” 

He reached over and flipped 
off the phone. Then he looked 
up and into the other part 
of the ship’s hospital space. 
Kathy came out from behind a 
screen, where she’d made ready 
for bed. She was beaming. She 
had a large picture book under 
one arm and a doll under the 
other. 

“It’s all right for me to have 
these with me, isn’t it. Doctor 
Nordenfeld?” she asked hope- 
fully. “I didn’t have any picture 
books but one, and it got worn 
out. And my doll — it was 
dreadful how shabby she was!” 

The doctor frowned. She 
smiled at him. He said, “After 
all, picture books are made to be 
looked at and dolls to be played 
with.” 

She skipped to the tiny hos- 
pital bed on the far side of the 
presumably virusproof partition. 
She climbed into it and zestfully 
arranged the doll to share it. She 
placed the book within’ easy 
reach. 

She said, “I think my father 
would say you were very nice. 
Doctor Nordenfeld, to look after 
me so well.” 

“No-o-o-o,” said the doctor in 



a detached voice. “I’m just doing 
what anybody ought to do.” 

She snuggled down under the 
covers. He looked at his watch 
and shmgged. It was very easy 
to confuse official night with 
official day, in space. Everybody 
else was asleep. He’d been put- 
ting Kathy through tests which 
began with measurements of 
pulse and respiration and tem- 
perature and went on from 
there. Kathy managed them her- 
self, under his direction. 

He settled down with one of 
the medical books he’d brought 
into the isolation section with 
him. Its title was Decontamina- 
tion of Infectious Material from 
Different Planets. He read it 
grimly. 

^1 'HE TIME came when the 
Star Queen should have 
come out of overdrive with the 
sun Circe blazing fiercely near- 
by, and a green planet with ice 
caps to be approached on inter- 
planetary drive. There should 
have been droning, comforting 
drive noises to assure the pas- 
sengers — who naturally could 
not see beyond the ship’s steel 
walls — that they were within 
a mere few million miles of a 
world where sunshine was 
normal, and skies were higher 
than ship’s ceilings, and there 
were fascinating things to see 
and do. 



DOCTOR

Some of the passengers 
packed their luggage and put it 
outside their cabins to be picked 
up for landing. But no stewards 
came for it. Presently there was 
an explanation. The ship had 
run under maximum speed and 
the planetfall would be delayed. 

The passengers were disap- 
pointed but not concerned. The 
luggage vanished into cabins 
again. 

The Star Queen floated in 
space among a thousand thou- 
sand million stars. Her astroga- 
tors had computed a course to 
the nearest star into which to 
drive the Star Queen, but it 
would not be used unless there 
was mutiny among the crew. It 
would be better to go in remote 
orbit around Circe III and give 
the news of chlorophage on 
Altaira, if Doctor Nordenfeld re- 
ported it on the ship. 

Time passed. One day. Two. 
Three. Then Jensen called the 
hospital compartment on vision- 
phone. His expression was dazed. 
Nordenfeld saw the interior of 
the control room behind Jensen. 
He said, “You’re a passenger, 
Jensen. How is it you’re in the 
control room?” 

Jensen moistened his lips. 
“The skipper thought I’d bet- 
ter not associate with the other 
passengers. I’ve stayed with the 
officers the past few days. We — 
the ones who know what’s in 



prospect — we’re keeping sep- 
arate from the others so — no- 
body will let anything out by 
accident.” 

“Very wise. When the skipper 
comes back on duty, ask him to 
call me. I’ve something interest- 
ing to tell him.” 

“He’s — checking something 
now,” said Jensen. His voice was 
thin and reedy. “The — air offi- 
cer reports there are white 
patches on the plants in the air 
room. They’re growing. Fast. 
He told me to tell you. He’s — 
gone to make sure.” 

“No need,” said Nordenfeld 
bitterly. 

He swung the vision-screen. 
It faced that part of the hospital 
space beyond the plastic sheet- 
ing. There were potted flower- 
ing plants there. They had 
pleased Kathy. They shared her 
air. And there were white patch- 
es on their leaves. 

“I thought,” said Nordenfeld 
with an odd mirthless levity, 
“that the skipper’d be interested. 
It is of no importance whatever 
now, but I accomplished some- 
thing remarkable. Kathy’s fa- 
ther didn’t manage an aseptic 
transfer. She brought the chlor- 
ophage with her. But I confined 
it. The plants on the far side of 
that plastic sheet show the chlor- 
ophage patches plainly. I expect 
Kathy to show signs of anemia 
shortly. I’d decided that drastic 



188 



GALAXY 



measures would have to be tak- 
en, and it looked like they might 
work, because I’ve confined the 
virus. It’s there where Kathy is, 
but it isn’t where I am. All the 
botanical specimens on my side 
of the sheet are untouched. The 
phage hasn’t hit them. It is re- 
markable. But it doesn’t matter 
a damn if the air room’s infect- 
ed. And I was so proud!” 

Jensen did not respond. 

lyrORDENFELD said ironi- 
' cally, “Look what I accom- 
plished! I protected the air plants 
on my side See? They’re 
beautifully green! No sign of in- 
fection! It means that a man can 
work with chlorophage! A labor- 
atory ship could land on 
Kamerun and keep itself the 
equivalent of an aseptic-environ- 
ment room while the damned 
chlorophage was investigated 
and ultimately whipped! And it 
doesn’t matter!” 

Jensen said numbly, “We 
can’t ever make port. We ought 
— we ought to — ” 

“We’ll take the necessary 
measures,” Nordenfeld told him. 
“Very quietly and very efficient- 
ly, with neither the crew nor the 
passengers knowing that Altaira 
sent the chlorophage on board 
the Star Queen in the hope of 
banishing it from there. The 
passengers won’t know that their 
own officials shipped it off with 



them as they tried to run away 
. And I was so proud that I’d 
improvised an aseptic room to 
keep Kathy in! I sterilized the 
air that went in to her, and I 
sterilized — ” 

Then he stopped. He stopped 
quite short. He stared at the air 
unit, set up and with two pipes 
passing through the plastic par- 
tition which cut the hospital 
space in two. He turned utterly 
white. He went roughly to the 
air machine. He jerked back its 
cover. He put his hand inside. 

Minutes later he faced back to 
the vision-screen from which 
Jensen looked apathetically at 
him. 

“Tell the skipper to call me,” 
he said in a savage tone. “Tell 
him to call me instantly he 
comes back! Before he issues 
any orders at all!” 

He bent over the sterilizing 
equipment and very carefully 
began to disassemble it. He had 
it completely apart when Kathy 
waked. She peered at him 
through the plastic separation 
sheet. 

“Good morning. Doctor Nor- 
denfeld,” she said cheerfully. 

The doctor grunted. Kathy 
smiled at him. She had gotten 
on very good terms with the 
doctor, since she’d been kept in 
the ship’s hospital. She did not 
feel that she was isolated. In 
having the doctor where she 



DOCTOR 



189 



could talk to him at any time, 
she had much more company 
than ever before. She had read 
her entire picture book to him 
and discussed her doll at length. 
She took it for granted that when 
he did not answer or frowned that 
he was simply busy. But he was 
company because she could see 
him. 

Doctor Nordenfeld put the air 
apparatus together with an ex- 
tremely peculiar expression on 
his face. It had been built for 
Kathy’s special isolation by a 
ship’s mechanic. It should steri- 
lize the used air going into 
Kathy’s part of the compartment, 
and it should sterilize the used air 
pushed out by the supplied fresh 
air. The hospital itself was an in- 
dependent sealed unit, with its 
own chemical air freshener, and 
it had been divided into two. The 
air freshener was where Doctor 
Nordenfeld could attend to it, 
and the sterilizer pump simply 
shared the freshening with 
Kathy. But — 

But the pipe that pumped air 
to Kathy was brown and dis- 
colored from having been used 
for sterilizing, and the pipe that 
brought air back was not. It was 
cold. It had never been heated. 

So Doctor Nordenfeld had 
been exposed to any contagion 
Kathy could spread. He hadn’t 
been protected at all. Yet the 
potted plants on Kathy’s side of 



the barrier wtere marked with 
great white splotches which 
grew almost as one looked, while 
the botanical specimens in the 
doctor’s part of the hospital — 
as much infected as Kathy’s 
could have been, by failure of 
the ship’s mechanic to build the 
sterilizer to work two ways: the 
stacked plants, the alien plants, 
the strange plants from seventy 
light-years beyond Regulus — 
they were vividly green. There 
was no trace of chlorophage on 
them. Yet they had been as 
thoroughly exposed as Doctor 
Nordenfeld himself! 

The doctor’s hands shook. His 
eyes burned. He took out a sur- 
geon’s scalpel and ripped the 
plastic partition from floor to 
ceiling. Kathy watched interest- 
edly. 

“Why did you do that. Doctor 
Nordenfeld?” she asked. 

He said in an emotionless, un- 
natural voice, “I’m going to do 
something that it was very stu- 
pid of me not to do before. It 
should have been done when 
you were six years old, Kathy. It 
should have been done on Kam- 
erun, and after that on Altaira. 
Now we’re going to do it here. 
You can help me.” 

^ I ■'HE Star Queen had floated 
out of overdrive long enough 
to throw all distance computa- 
tions off. But she swung about.

and swam back, and presently 
she was not too far from the 
world where she was now many 
days overdue. Lift-ships started 
up from the planet’s surface. But 
i the Star Queen ordered them 
^ back. 

0 “Get your spaceport health of- 

1 ficer on the vision-phone,” or- 
I dered the Star Queen’s skipper. 

► “We’ve had chlorophage on 
board.” 

There was panic. Even at a 
distance of a hundred thousand 
miles, chlorophage could strike 
stark terror into anybody. But 
: presently the image of the space- 

port health officer appeared on 
I the Star Queen’s screen. 

' “We’re not landing,” said Doc- 
i tor Nordenfeld. “There’s almost 
certainly an outbreak of chloro- 
I phage on Altaira, and we’re go- 
' ing back to do something about 
1 it. It got on our ship with pas- 
sengers from there. We’ve 

> whipped it, but we may need 
[ some help.” 

' The image of the health offi- 
I cer aground was a mask of 
horror for seconds after Norden- 
j feld’s last statement. Then his 
i expression became incredulous, 
though still horrified. 

' “We came on to here,” said 
Doctor Nordenfeld, “to get you 
to send word by the first other 
' ship to the Patrol that a quaran- 
! tine has to be set up on Altaira, 
and we need to be inspected for 



recovery from chlorophage in- 
fection. And we need to pass on, 
officially, the discovery that 
whipped the contagion on this 
ship. We were carrying botani- 
cal specimens to Cassim and we 
discovered that they were im- 
mune to chlorophage. That’s 
absurd, of course. Their green 
coloring is the same substance 
as in plants under Sol-type suns 
anywhere. They couldn’t be 
immune to chlorophage. So 
there had to be something else.” 

“Was — was there?” asked 
the health officer. 

“There was. Those specimens 
came from somewhere beyond 
Regulus. They carried, as normal 
symbiotes on their foliage, mi- 
croorganisms unknown both on 
Kamerun and Altaira. The alien 
bugs are almost the size of virus 
particles, feed on virus particles, 
and are carried by contact, air, 
and so on, as readily as virus 
particles themselves. We dis- 
covered that those microorgan- 
isms devoured chlorophage. We 
washed them off the leaves of 
the plants, sprayed them in our 
air-room jungle, and they multi- 
plied faster than the chloro- 
phage. Our whole air supply is 
now loaded with an airborne 
antichlorophage organism which 
has made our crew and passen- 
gers immune. We’re heading 
back to Altaira to turn loose our 
merry little bugs on that planet. 



DOCTOR 



191 



It appears that they grow on 
certain vegetation, but they’ll 
live anywhere there’s phage to 
eat. We’re keeping some chloro- 
phage cultures alive so our mi- 
croorganisms don’t die out for 
lack of food!” 

The medical officer on the 
ground gasped. “Keeping phage 
alive?” 

i6T HOPE you’ve recorded 

•^this,” said Nordenfeld. “It’s 
rather important. This trick 
should have been tried on Kam- 
erun and Altaira and every- 
where else new diseases have 
turned up. When there’s a bug on 
one planet that’s deadly to us, 
there’s bound to be a bug on 
some other planet that’s deadly 
to it! The same goes for any 
pests or vermin — the principle 
of natural enemies. All we have 
to do is find the enemies!” 

There was more communica- 
tion between the Star Queen and 
the spaceport on Circe III, which 
the Star Queen would not make 
other contact with on this trip, 
and presently the big liner head- 
ed back to Altaira. It was nec- 
essary for official as well as hu- 
manitarian reasons. There 
would need to be a health exam- 
ination of the Star Queen to cer- 



tify that it was safe for passen- 
gers to breathe her air and eat 
in her restaurants and swim in 
her swimming pools and occupy 
the six levels of passenger cab- 
ins she contained. This would 
have to be done by a Patrol 
ship, which would turn up at Al- 
taira. 

The Star Queen’s skipper 
would be praised by his owners 
for not having driven the liner 
into a star, and the purser would 
be forgiven for the confusion in 
his records due to off-schedule 
operations of the big ship, and 
Jensen would find in the ending 
of all terror of chlorophage an 
excellent reason to look for ap- 
preciation in the value of the 
investments he was checking up. 
And Doctor Nordenfeld . 

He talked very gravely to 
Kathy. “I’m afraid,” he told her, 
“that your father isn’t coming 
back. What would you like to 
do?” 

She smiled at him hopefully. 
“Could I be your little girl?” she 
asked. Doctor Nordenfeld 
grunted. “Hm . I’ll think 
about it.” 

But he smiled at her. She 
grinned at him. And it was 
settled.

we lost our rudder. It all sounds 
funny — like our boiler going 
out and being reconnected to the 
scuttlebutt, which, for those who 
haven’t had the pleasure, is a 
drinking fountain, and our ack- 
ack and the DE’s practicing on 
helium-filled balloons and not 
downing a single one, while, a day 
ahead of us, a cruiser was sunk 
— but funny it wasn’t in waters 
like those, with more than a 
sufficiency of sharks and Portu- 
guese men-of-war all around. 

Up came our lovable top 
sergeant with the same challenge, 
when the chant was “Golden 
Gate in ’48!” Again there was 
that awful clench and I said, 
“August 13th.” But this time I 
was a bit smarter; I got 2-to-l 
odds and a leeway of a month in 
either direction. I was off by only 
a day. 

With the war over, I was beset 
by buddies wanting to know 
when they would be going home. 
I told them I didn’t know about 
them, but I was leaving in 
February. Until recently, I 
thought I left in March. I didn’t. 
It was February. 

For those who collect such 
documented instances, please 
leave me out of it and hound the 
1294th Combat Engineers for 
confirmation. 

And, yes, I had my run-ins 
with telepathy as well as pre- 



cognition. I have had no personal 
experience with the other pisi 
factors, if any of them actually 
exist. And I have to get to my 
point in a rather round-about 
fashion. 

Some time back, poker hunger 
brought me into contact with odd 
lots of people — writers and 
artists and editors, of course, but 
also composers, musicians, cloth- 
ing manufacturers, a whole cross- 
section that eventually led to 
psychoanalysts — -two, to be 
exact. One always looked green 
and ill; if you feel like laughing, 
hold on a moment — the evi- 
dence seems to indicate that only 
the sick can truly abide sickness. 

^The other analyst was big and 
bouncy — he had clearly been 
told in his analysis to be bouncy. 
He kicked off his shoes as soon 
as he' entered, flung himself at 
furniture and women, and tried 
infuriatingly to play wild games. 
Traits aside, he’s the one who 
counts here. He needed a Ph.D. 
thesis and asked if I had an idea. 
I did. 

Camille Flammarion, a French 
astronomer of the 19th century, 
spent — as far as I know — his 
last years checking out reports 
of fisher folk knowing when their 
men were drowning at sea. Vivid 
dreams, sudden frightening vi- 
sions, that sort of thing. Flam- 
marion found that these were all 
but universal in the fishing vil-

lages whenever the men put out. 
Only the ones that proved true 
were remembered. He naturally 
drew the wrong conclusion. 

In the psych journals today, 
analysts are mooning around 
with startling examples of tele- 
pathy and foreknowledge in 
their patients, and, like Flam- 
marion, drawing wrong conclu- 
sions, but for opposite reasons 
— the ones that have held psi in 
an iron grip since Odd John. 

Olaf Stapledon, the author of 
Odd John, confessed even before 
being asked that he was not a 
storyteller, as if that weren’t 
completely apparent. He came 
closest to telling a story in this 
book, however, and of course I 
used it as a Galaxy Novel — I’m 
a professional editor, which 
means I put aside my convictions 
if they get in the way of a story. 
But as a professional editor, had 
Stapledon been alive, I would 
have had him do two things: 

— Tell the story entirely 
through the narrator, without 
once quoting Odd John. If he’s 
that much beyond sapiens, John 
would be as incomprehensible, 
barring a handful of phrases, as 
a man to a dog. Instead, he 
sounds like a jackass, and an 
unforgivably wordy one. 

— For the love of plain com- 
mon sense, make that whole last 
section add up! Why go to all 
that trouble if that colony of 



psis, gathered with such care and 
secrecy, suddenly knows it is 
endangered — and goes under 
rather than disperse at once to 
protect its precious alleged 
genes? 

But those two changes would 
be for story, nothing else. The 
common denominator would not 
be involved. Nor would it be now 
if that suction pump would get 
out of authors’ typewriters. For 
psi must revert to just another 
theme, to be explored from all 
angles, not frozen to the belief 
that it is a superior faculty, or 
blasted out of our path. 

Flammarion was the first to 
note that psi does not hold up 
under statistical conditions. But 
he was in the right place — the 
common denominator is anxiety. 

Anyone who thinks that anx- 
iety is a necessary or even useful 
human condition should envy 
Pavlov’s dogs — anxiety is pre- 
cisely what he was inducing and 
the pathetic creatures were do- 
ing their canine best to read him. 
They didn’t do very well — and 
neither do humans; the accuracy 
is spottily startling, nothing to 
bet on as a whole. 

Think back on the overwhelm- 
ings that temporarily made you 
a ham radio in a pstatic pstorm. 
Y ou were functioning at your 
best? Higher faculty, huh?
