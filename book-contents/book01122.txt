YET STILL IT MOVES 



Tn the history of science there 

are many heroes. Galileo, Gi- 
ordano Bruno, John Tyndall . 
the roll is endless. Everyone 
knows the story of Galileo, for in- 
stance — how he wrote his Dia- 
logue on the T wo World Systems, 
was called to account by the Ro- 
man Inquisition for saying that 
the Earth moved around the sun, 
was compelled to recant on threat 
of burning and, all the same, 
whispered under his breath, “Ep- 
pur si muove” - - - “Yet still it 
moves!” 

Of course, there’s some doubt 
that Galileo really said that; it’s 
the sort of story that, if it didn’t 
really happen, it would have been 
necessary to invent, and as a mat- 
ter of fact it seems that someone 
did invent that particular sotto- 
voce remark, because it can’t be 
traced back much before a cen- 
tury after the event. But there 
can’t be any question about Gior- 
dano Bruno. He was a Copemi- 
can — that is, he held the radical 
view that the Earth moved 
around the sun, rather than the 
orthodox, Ptolemaic view that the 
Earth stood still while the sun 
moved around it. He was sum- 



moned before that same Inquisi- 
tion. He did refuse to recant. And 
he was in fact burned at the stake 
as a heretic. 

John Tyndall, on the other 
hand, got off lightly, though he 
must have had some exciting mo- 
ments for a while. His sin against 
orthodoxy was to say (at a meet- 
ing of the British Royal Society) 
that there were no limits to what 
science could discover about the 
universe; whereupon a Londoner 
began an action for blasphemy 
against him. That was less than a 
century ago, in Queen Victoria’s 
enlightened time, and probably 
no one was more surprised than 
Tyndall at the prosecution. But 
he was acquitted, after all, and 
no harm done. 

Still, he stood up for what he be- 
lieved, and fairly deserves a place 
among those heroes who cham- 
pioned truth against Error .... 

Or did they? 

Well, there’s a little problem 
there. As a matter of fact, things 
weren’t quite that way. Giordano 
Bruno? They burned him as a 
heretic, all right. But not for his 
astronomy. He was, after all, a 
Dominican monk before he was

an astronomer; he spent as much 
time arguing transubstantiation 
as planetary orbits, and the par- 
ticular heresies for which he went 
to the stake were purely theolo- 
gical — they blamed his books 
for their science, but they burned 
his body for questions about the 
nature of the Trinity. 

And Galileo, it is true, was 
called to account for saying the 
Earth moved around the sun. 
The Inquisition called that notion 
“philosophically false” and in 
other ways both wrongheaded 
and dangerous. It was not, how- 
ever, specifically contrary to 
Scripture, and so it was not here- 
sy- 

What was contrary to Scrip- 
ture, and therefore heretical, and 
therefore good grounds for an 
auto-da-fe, was Galileo’s insis- 
tence that the Sun was at rest. 
He could say the Earth moved 
if he liked, ruled the Inquisition; 
pernicious as it was, it was not 
actionable. But if he said the Sun 
stood still, and refused to recant, 
he would have to be abandoned 
to the secular arm, for that was 
heresy. 

And the interesting thing about 
that, of course, is that, heresy or 
not, Galileo was wrong. The sun 
does move. It moves, like every 
other particle in our revolving 
galaxy, at speeds and in direc- 
tions that the Inquisitors never 
dreamed of and even Galileo 



could not have guessed. But if 
he had stood by his faith, refused 
to recant and. burned . what 
he would have burned for was as 
wrong as the views he opposed. 

\ re these paragraphs an at- 
tempt to prove the essential 
wisdom of the Inquisition, or to 
justify the supression of unpopu- 
lar beliefs? 

Not at all. We do think there’s 
a moral to be drawn, but that’s 
not it. 

Right or wrong, Galileo was 
less wrong than his Inquisitors in 
his attitudes, is not in all of his 
facts. For his attitude was that 
there is order in the universe, and 
that Man can, through his own 
senses and intellect, discover what 
it is, without the guidance of Di- 
vine Writ or the approval of 
authorities. 

The cause for which Giordano 
Bruno burned and Galileo served 
his penance was not Right with 
a capital “R”; it was a right — 
the right to dissent — the right to 
oppose authority when authority 
seems in error. 

That strikes us as a particular- 
ly precious right, and basic to 
most other rights, and one which 
has been often threatened in the 
history of the human race — 
more recently than the 16th cen- 
tury, and closer at hand than 
Rome.

GOBLIN

RESERVATION 



Illustrated by MORROW 



In this tomorrow-world, goblins, gnomes 
and ghosts were perfectly normal — but a 
man returned from death surely was not! 



I 

Tnspector Drayton sat, solidly 
planted behind the desk and 
waited. He was a rawboned man 
with a face that looked as if it 
might have been hacked, by a 
dull hatchet, out of a block of 
gnarled wood. His eyes were 
points of flint, and at times they 
seemed to glitter and he was an- 



gry and upset. But such a man, 
Peter Maxwell knew, would never 
give way to any kind of anger. 
There was, behind that anger, a 
bulldog quality that would go 
plodding on, undisturbed by an- 
ger. 

And this was just the situation, 
Maxwell told himself, that he had 
hoped would not come about. Al- 
though, as now was evident, it 



8 



had been too much to hope. He 
had known, of course, that his 
failure to arrive at his proper 
destination, some six weeks be- 
fore, would have created some 
consternation back here on the 
Earth; the thought that he might 
be able to slip home unobserved 
had not been realistic. And now 
here he was, facing this man 
across the desk. He’d have to 
take it easy. 

He said to the man behind the 
desk: “I don’t believe I entirely 
understand why my return to 
Earth should be a matter for 
Security. My name is Peter Max- 
well, and I’m a member of the 
faculty of the College of Super- 
natural Phenomena on Wiscon- 
sin Campus. You have seen my 
papers . 

“I am quite satisfied,” said 
Drayton, “as to who you are. 
Puzzled, perhaps, but entirely 
satisfied. It’s something else that 
bothers me. Professor Maxwell, 
would you mind telling me ex- 
actly where you’ve been?” 

“There’s not very much that I 
can tell you,” Peter Maxwell said. 
“I was on a planet, but I don’t 
know its name or its co-ordinates. 
It may be closer than a light- 
year or out beyond the Rim.” 

“In any event,” said Drayton, 
“you did not arrive at the destina- 
tion you indicated on your travel 
ticket.” 

“I did not,” said Maxwell. 

GOBLIN RESERVATION 



“Can you explain what hap- 
pened?” 

“I can only guess. I thought 
that perhaps my wave pattern 
was diverted, perhaps intercepted 
and then diverted. At first I 
thought there had been transmit- 
ter error, but that seems impos- 
sible. The transmitters have been 
in use for hundreds of years. All 
the bugs should have been ironed 
out of them by now.” 

“You mean that you were kid- 
napped?” 

“If you want to put it that 
way.” 

“And still will tell me nothing 7 ” 

“I have explained there’s not 
much to tell.” 

“Could this planet have any- 
thing to do with the Wheelers?” 

A /Taxwell shook his head. “I 
couldn’t say for sure, but 
I don’t believe it did. Certainly 
there was none of them around. 
There was no indication they had 
anything to do with it.” 

“Professor Maxwell, have you 
ever seen a Wheeler?” 

“Once. Several years ago. One 
of them spent a month or two at 
Time. I caught sight of it one 
day.” 

“So you would know a Wheeler, 
if you saw one?” 

“Yes, indeed,” said Maxwell. 

“I see you started out for one 
of the planets in the Coonskin 
system.”

“There was the rumor of a 
dragon,” Maxwell told him. “Not 
substantiated. In fact, the evi- 
dence was quite sketchy. But I 
decided it might be worth in- 
vestigating.” 

Drayton cocked an eyebrow. 
“A dragon?” he demanded some- 
what sarcastically. 

“I suppose,” said Maxwell, 
“that it may be hard for some- 
one outside my field to grasp the 
importance of a dragon. But the 
fact of the matter is that there 
is no scrap of evidence to suggest 
such a creature at any time exist- 
ed. This despite the fact that the 
dragon legend is solidly embed- 
ded in the folklore of the Earth 
and some of the other planets. 
Fairies, goblins, trolls, banshees 
— we have all of these, in the 
actual flesh. Or what passes for 
flesh. But no trace of a dragon. 
The funny thing about it is that 
the legend here on Earth is not 
basically a human legend. The 
Little Folk have the dragon leg- 
end as well. I sometimes think 
they may have been the ones 
who transmitted it to us. But the 
legend only. There is no evi- 
dence . ” 

He stopped, feeling a little silly. 
What could this stolid policeman 
who sat across the desk care 
about the dragon legend? 

“I’m sorry, Inspector,” he said. 
“I let my enthusiasm for a favo- 
rite subject run away with me.” 
10 



“I have heard it said that the 
dragon legend might have risen 
from ancestral memories of the 
dinosaur.” 

“I have heard it, too,” said 
Maxwell, “but it seems impossi- 
ble. The dinosaurs were extinct 
long before mankind had evolv- 
ed.” 

“Then the Little Folk . ” 

“Possibly,” said Maxwell. “But 
it seems unlikely. I know the 
Little Folk and have talked with 
them about it. They are ancient, 
certainly much more ancient than 
we humans, but there is no indi- 
cation they go back as far as the 
Cretaceous. Or if they do, they 
have no memory of it. And I 
would think that their legends 
and folk tales would easily carry 
over some millions of years. They 
are extremely long-lived, not 
quite immortal, but almost, and 
in a situation such as that, mouth- 
to-mouth tradition would be 
most persistent.” 

Drayton gestured, brushing 
away the dragons and the Little 
Folk. “You started for the Coon- 
skin,” he said, “and you didn’t 
get there.” 

“That is right. There was this 
other planet. A roofed-in, crystal 
planet.” 

“Crystal?” 

“Some sort of stone. Quartz, 
perhaps. Although I can’t be sure. 
It could be metal. There was 
some metal there.” 



GALAXY 



D rayton asked smoothly. “You 
wouldn’t have known when 
you started out that you’d wind 
up on this planet?” 

“If it’s collusion you have in 
mind,” said Maxwell, “you’re 
very far afield. I was quite sur- 
prised. But it seems you aren’t. 
You were waiting here for me.” 
“Not particularly surprised,” 
said Drayton. “It has happened 
twice before.” 

“Then you probably know 
about the planet.” 

“Nothing about it,” said Dray- 
ton. “Simply that there’s a planet 
out there somewhere, operating 
an unregistered transmitter and 
receiver, and communicating by 
an unlisted signal. When the oper- 
ator here at Wisconsin Station 
picked up their signal for trans- 
mittal, he signaled them to wait, 
that the receivers all were busy. 
Then he got in touch with me.” 
“The other two?” 

“Both of them right here. Both 
tabbed for Wisconsin Station.” 
“But if they got back . ” 
“That’s the thing,” said Dray- 
ton. “They didn’t. Oh, I guess 
you could say they did, but we 
couldn’t talk with them. The 
wave pattern turned out faulty. 
They were put back together 
wrong. They were all messed up. 
Both of them were aliens, but 
so tangled up we had a hard time 
learning who they might have 
been. We’re still not positive.” 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



“Dead?” 

“Dead? Certainly. A rather 
frightful business. You’re a lucky 
man.” 

Maxwell, with some difficulty, 
suppressed a shudder.. “Yes, I 
suppose I am,” he said. 

“You’d think,” said Drayton, 
“that anyone who messed around 
with matter transmission would 
make sure they knew how it is 
done. There’s no telling how 
many they may have picked up 
who came out wrong in their re- 
ceiving station.” 

“But you would know,” Max- 
well pointed out. “You’d know if 
there had been any losses. A sta- 
tion would report back immedi- 
ately if a traveler failed to arrive 
on schedule.” 

“That’s the funny thing about 
it,” Drayton told him. “There 
have been no losses. We’re pretty 
sure the two aliens who came 
back dead to us got where they 
were going, for there’s no one 
missing.” 

“But I started out for Coon- 
skin. Surely they reported . ” 

Then he stopped as the thought 
struck him, struck him straight 
between the eyes. 

Drayton nodded slowly. “I 
thought you would catch on. 
Peter Maxwell — one Peter Max- 
well — got to the Coonskin sys- 
tem and came back to Earth al- 
most a month ago.” 

“There must be some mistake.” 

11 



■ For it was unthinkable that 
there should be two of him, that 
another Peter Maxwell, identical 
in all details, existed on the 
Earth. 

“No mistake,” said Drayton. 
“Not the way we have it figured. 
This other planet doesn’t divert 
the pattern. What it does is copy 
it.” 

“Then there could be two of 
me! There could be — ” 

“Not any more,” said Drayton. 
“You’re the only one. About a 
week after he returned, there was 
an accident. Peter Maxwell’s 
dead.” 

II 

A round the comer from the tiny 

■ room where he’d met with 
Drayton, Maxwell found a va- 
cant row of seats. He sat down 
in one of them carefully, placing 
his single piece of luggage on the 
floor beside him. 

It was incredible, he told him- 
self. Incredible that there should 
have been two Pete Maxwells and 
now one of those Maxwells dead. 
Incredible that the crystal planet 
could have had equipment that 
would reach out and copy a wave 
pattern traveling faster than the 
speed of light — much faster than 
the speed of light, for at no point 
in the galaxy so far linked by the 
matter transmitters was there any 
noticeable lag between the time 
12 



of transmittal and arrival. Diver- 
sion — yes, perhaps there could 
be diversion, a reaching out and 
a snatching of the pattern, but 
the task of copying such a pattern 
would be something else entirely. 

Two incredibles, he thought. 
Two things that should not have 
happened. Although if one of 
them had happened, the other 
surely followed. If the pattern 
had been copied, there would, 
quite necessarily, have been two 
of him, the one who went to the 
Coonskin system and the other 
who’d gone to the crystal planet. 
But if this other Peter Maxwell 
had really gone to Coonskin. he 
should still be there or only now 
returning. He had planned a six 
weeks’ stay at least, longer if 
more time seemed necessary to 
run down the dragon business. 

He found that his hands were 
shaking. Ashamed, he clasped 
them hard together and held them 
in his lap. 

He couldn’t go to pieces, he 
told himself. No matter what 
might be facing him, he had to 
see it through. And there was no 
evidence, no solid evidence. All 
that he had was what a member 
of Security had told him, and he 
couldn’t count on that. It could 
be no more than a clumsy piece 
of police trickery designed to 
shake him into talking. Although 
it could have happened. It just 
could have happened! 



GALAXY 



But even if it had happened, 
he still had to see it through. For 
he had a job to do, and one he 
must not bungle. 

Now the job might be made 
the harder by someone watching 
him, although he could not be 
sure there’d be someone watch- 
ing. It might not make any differ- 
ence. His hardest job would be 
to get an appointment with An- 
drew Arnold. The president of a 
planetary university would not 
be an easy man to see. He would 
have more with which to concern 
himself than listening to what an 
associate professor had to say. 
Especially when that professor 
could not spell out in advance 
detail what he wished to talk 
about. 

His hands had stopped trem- 
bling, but he still kept them tight- 
ly clasped. In just a little while 
he’d get out of here and go down 
to the roadway, where he’d find 
himself a seat on one of the inner, 
faster belts. In an hour or so he’d 
be back on the old home campus 
and then he’d soon find out if 
what Drayton said was true. And 
he’d be back with friends again 
— with Alley Oop and Ghost, 
with Harlow Sharp and Allen 
Preston and all the rest of them. 
There’d be rowdy midnight 
drinking bouts at the Pig 85 Whis- 
tle and long, slow walks along the 
shaded malls and canoeing on the 
lake. There’d be discussion and 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



argument and the telling of old 
tales, and the leisurely academic 
routine that gave one time to live. 

TTe found himself looking for- 
-*■ ^ ward to the trip, for the road- 
way ran along the hills of Goblin 
Reservation. Not that there were 
only goblins there. There were 
many other kinds of the Little 
Folk, and they all were friends 
of his. Or at least most of them 
were friends. Trolls at times could 
be exasperating. And it was rough 
to build up any real and lasting 
friendship with a creature like a 
banshee. 

This time of year, he thought, 
the hills would be beautiful. It 
had been late summer when he’d 
left for the Coonskin system, and 
the hills still had worn their 
mantle of dark green; but now, in 
the middle of October, they would 
have burst into the full color of 
their autumn dress. There’d be 
the winy red of oak and the bril- 
liant red and yellow of the ma- 
ples, and here and there the flam- 
ing scarlet of creeping vines 
would run like a thread through 
all the other colors, and the air 
would smell like cider, that 
strange, intoxicating scent that 
came upon the woods only with 
the dying of the leaves. 

He sat there, thinking of the 
time, just two summers past, 
when he and Mr. O’Toole had 
gone on a canoe trip up the 

13 



river, into the northern wilder- 
ness* hoping that somewhere 
along the way they might make 
some sort of contact with the 
spirits recorded in the old Ojib- 
way legends. They had floated 
on the glass-clear waters and 
built their fires at night on the 
edges of the dark pine forests; 
they had caught their fish for 
supper and hunted down the wild 
flowers hidden in the forest glades 
and spied on many animals and 
birds and had a good vacation. 
But they had seen no spirits, 
which was not surprising. Very 
few contacts had been made with 
the Little Folk of North America, 
for' they were truly creatures of 
the wilds, unlike the semi-civil- 
ized, human-accustomed sprites 
of Europe. 

The chair in which he sat faced 
the West, and through the tower- 
ing walls of glass he could see 
across the river to the bluffs that 
rose along the border of the an- 
cient state of Iowa — great, dark 
purple masses rimmed by a pale 
blue autumn sky. Atop one of the 
bluffs he could make out the 
lighter bulk of the College of 
Thaumaturgy, staffed in large 
part by the octopoid creatures 
from Centaurus. Looking at those 
faint outlines of the buildings, he 
recalled that he had often prom- 
ised himself he’d attend one of 
their summer seminars, but had 
never got around to doing it.

He reached out and shifted his 
luggage, preparing to get up, but 
he stayed sitting there. He still 
was a little short of breath, and 
his legs seemed weak. What 
Drayton had told him, he realiz- 
ed, had hit him harder than he’d 
thought. It still was hitting him 
in a series of delayed reactions. 
He’d have to take it easy, he told 
himself. He couldn’t get the wind 
up. It might not be true; it prob- 
ably wasn’t true. There was no 
sense in getting too concerned 
about it until he’d had the chance 
to find out for himself. 

Slowly he got to his feet and 
reached down to pick up his lug- 
gage, but hesitated for a moment 
to plunge into the hurried con- 
fusion of the waiting room. Peo- 
ple — alien and human — were 
hurrying purposefully or stood 
about in little knots and clusters. 
An old, white-bearded man, 
dressed in stately black — a pro- 
fessor by the looks of him, 
thought Maxwell — was sur- 
rounded by a group of students 
who had to come to see him off. 
A family of reptilians sprawled in 
a group of loungers set aside for 
people such as they, not built for 
sitting. The two adults lay quiet- 
ly, facing one another and talking 
softly, with the hissing overtones 
that marked reptilian speech, 
while the youngsters crawled over 
and under the loungers and 
sprawled on the floor in play. In 

GALAXY 



one comer of a tiny alcove a beer- 
barrel creature, lying on its side, 
rolled gently back and forth, 
from one wall to the other, roll- 
ing back and forth in the same 
spirit, and perhaps for the same 
purpose, a man would pace the 
floor. Two spidery creatures, 
their bodies more like grotesque 
matchstick creations than honest 
flesh and blood, squatted facing 
one another. They had marked 
off upon the floor, with a piece of 
chalk, some sort of crude game- 
board and had placed about upon 
it a number of strangely shaped 
pieces, which they were moving 
rapidly about, squeaking in ex- 
citement as the game developed. 

Wheelers? Drayton had asked. 
Was there any tie-up with the 
crystal planet and the Wheelers? 

Tt always was the Wheelers, 
■^•thought Ma*well. An obsession 
with the Wheelers. And perhaps 
with reason, although one could 
not be sure. For there was little 
known of them. They loomed 
darkly, far in space, another great 
cultural group pushing out across 
the galaxy, coming into ragged 
contact along a far-flung frontier 
line with the punishing human 
culture. 

Standing there, he recalled that 
first and only time he had ever 
seen a Wheeler — a student who 
had come from the College of 
Comparative Anatomy in Rio de 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



Janeiro for a two-week seminar 
at Time College. Wisconsin Cam- 
pus, he remembered, had been 
quietly agog. There had been a 
lot of talk, but very little oppor- 
tunity to gain a glimpse of the 
fabled creature, since it stayed 
closely within the seminar con- 
fines. He had met it, trundling 
along a corridor, when he’d gone 
across the mall to have lunch 
with Harlow Sharp, and he re- 
called that he’d been shocked. 

It had been the wheels, he told 
himself. No other creature in the 
known galaxy came equipped 
with wheels. It had been a pudgy 
creature, a roly-poly suspended 
between two wheels, the hubs of 
which projected from its body 
somewhere near its middle. The 
wheels were encased in fur, and 
the rims of them were homy 
callouses. The downward bulge 
of the roly-poly body sagged be- 
neath the axle of the wheels like 
a bulging sack. But the worst of 
it, he saw when he came nearer, 
was that this sagging portion of 
the body was transparent and 
filled with a mass of writhing 
things which made one think Of 
a pail of gaily colored worms. 

And those writhing objects in 
that obscene and ebese belly, 
Maxwell knew, were, if not 
worms, at least some kind of in- 
sect, or a form of life which could 
equate with that form of life on 
Earth which men knew as insects. 

15 



For the Wheelers were a hive 
mechanism, a culture made up of 
many such hive’ mechanisms, a 
population of colonies of insects, 
or at least the equivalent of in- 
sects. 

And with a population of that 
sort, the tales of terror which 
came from the far and rough 
frontier about the Wheelers were 
not hard to understand. And if 
these horror tales were true, then 
man here faced, for the first time 
since his drive out into space, that 
hypothetical enemy which it al- 
ways had been presumed would 
be met somewhere in space. 



'Throughout the galaxy, man 
-*■ had met many other strange 
and, at times, fearsome creatures. 
But none could match fearsome- 
ness with a creature that was a 
wheel-driven hive of insects. 
There was something about the 
whole idea that made one want 
to gag. 

Today outlandish creatures 
flocked to the Earth in thousands, 
to attend the many colleges, to 
staff the faculties that made up 
that great galactic university 
which had taken over Earth. And 
in time, perhaps, the Wheelers 
might be added to this galactic 
population which swarmed the 
colleges of Earth — if only there 
could be some kind of under- 
standing contact. But so far there 
hadn’t been. 

16 



Why was it, Maxwell wondered, 
that the very idea of the Wheelers 
went against the grain when man 
and all the other creatures in the 
galaxy contacted by the humans 
had learned to live with one an- 
other? 

Here, in this waiting room, one 
could see a cross-section of them 
— the hoppers, the creepers, the 
crawlers, the wrigglers and rollers 
that came from the many planets 
from so many stars. Earth was 
the galactic melting pot, he 
thought, a place where beings 
from the thousand stars met and 
mingled to share their thoughts 
and cultures. 

“Number 5692,” shrilled the 
loudspeaker. “Passenger No. 56- 
92, your departure time is only 
five minutes from now. Cubicle 
37. Passenger 5692, please report 
immediately to Cubicle 37.” 

And where, Maxwell wondered, 
might No. 5692 be bound? To the 
jungles of Headache No. 2, to the 
grim, wind-swept glacial cities of 
Misery IV, to the desert planets 
of the Slaughter Suns, or to any 
of the other of the thousands of 
planets, all less than a heartbeat 
away from this very spot he 
stood, now linked by the trans- 
mitter system, but representing 
in the past long years of explora- 
tory effort as discovery ships beat 
through the dark of everlasting 
space. As they, were beating out 
there even now, slowly and pain- 

GALAXY 



fully expanding the perimeter of 
man’s known universe. 

The sounds of the waiting room 
boomed and muttered, with the 
frantic paging of late or missing 
passengers, with the hollow buzz 
of a hundred different tongues 
spoken in a thousand different 
throats, with the shuffling or the 
clicking or the clop of feet across 
the floor. 

He reached down and picked 
up his luggage, turned toward the 
entrance. 

After no more than three steps, 
he was halted to make way for 
a truck carrying a tank filled with 
a murky liquid. Through the 
cloudiness of the liquid, he 
caught a suggestion of the out- 
rageous shape that lurked within 
the tank — some creature from 
one of the liquid planets, perhaps, 
and one where the liquid was not 
water. Here, more than likely, 
as a visiting professor, perhaps 
to one of the colleges of philoso- 
phy, or maybe one of the science 
institutes. 

The truck and its tank out of 
the way, he went on and reached 
the entrance, stepped through the 
opening onto the beautifully 
paved and terraced esplanade, 
along the bottom of which ran the 
roadway belts. He was gratified 
to notice that there were no wait- 
ing lines, as often was the case, 
recently.. 

He drew a deep breath of air 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



into his lungs — clean, pure air 
with the sharp tang of frosty 
autumn in it. It was a welcome 
thing after the weeks of dead and 
musty air upon the crystal planet. 

T T e turned to go down the steps, 
-*■ A and as he did he saw the 
sign-board just beyond the gate 
to the roadway belts. The sign 
was large, and the lettering was 
in Old English, screaming with 
solid dignity:

“Maxwell,” someone shouted, 
and he swung around. A man was 
running toward him from the en- 
trance. 

Maxwell put down his luggage, 
half-raised his hand in greeting 
and acknowledgment, then slowly 
dropped it, for he realized that 
he did not recognize the man. 

The man slowed to a trot, then 
a rapid walk. 

“Professor Maxwell, isn’t it?” 
he asked as he came up. “I’m 
sure I’m not mistaken.” 

Maxwell nodded stiffly, just a 
bit embarrassed. 

“Monty Churchill,” said the 
man, thrusting out his hand. “We 
met, a year or so ago. At one of 
Nancy Clayton’s bashes.” 

17 



Ill 



“How are you, Churchill?” 
Maxwell asked, a little frostily. 

For now he did recognize the 
man, the nam£~at least if not the 
face. A lawyer, he supposed, but 
he wasn’t sure. Doing business, 
if he recalled correctly, as a pub- 
lic relations man, a fixer. One of 
that tribe which handled things 
for clients, for anyone who could 
put up a fee. 

“Why, I’m fine,” said Church- 
ill, happily. “Just back from a 
trip. A short one. But it’s good 
to be back again. There’s nothing 
quite like home. That’s why I 
yelled out at you. First familiar 
face I’ve seen for several weeks, 
at least.” 

“I’m glad you did,” said Max- 
well. 

“You going back to the cam- 
pus?” 

“Yes. I was heading for the 
roadway.” 

“No need of that,” said Church- 
ill. “I have my flier here. Parked 
on the strip out back. There’s 
room for both of us. Get there 
a good deal faster.” 

Maxwell hesitated. He didn’t 
like the man, but what Churchill 
said was true; they would get 
there faster. And he was anxious 
to get back as quickly as he 
could, for there were things that 
needed checking out. 

“That’s very kind of you,” he 
said. “If you’re sure you have the 
room.” 

18 



r T''he motor sputtered and went 
dead. The jets hummed for 
a second and then fell silent. The 
air sighed shrilly against the met- 
al hide. 

Maxwell glanced swiftly at the 
man beside him. Churchill sat 
stiff — perhaps in fear, perhaps 
only in astonishment. For even 
Maxwell realized that a thing 
like this should not have happen- 
ed. In fact, it was unthinkable. 
Fliers such as the one in which 
they rode were foolproof. 

Below them lay the jagged 
rocks of the craggy cliffs, the 
spearlike, upthrusting branches of 
the forest covering the hills, cling- 
ing to the rocks. To the left the 
river ran, a silver ribbon through 
the wooded bottom lands. 

Time seemed to drag, to 
lengthen out, as if by some 
strange magic each second had 
become a minute. And with the 
lengthening of time came a quiet 
awareness of what was about to 
happen as if it might be happen- 
ing to someone else. Maxwell told 
himself, and not to him, a factual 
and dispassionate assessment of 
the situation by an observer who 
was not involved. And even as 
he knew this, he also knew, in a 
dim, far corner of his mind, panic 
would come later; and when that 
came, time would take up its usu- 
al pace again as the flier rushed 

GALAXY 



down to meet the forest and the 
rock. 

Leaning forward, he scanned 
the terrain that stretched ahead, 
and as he did he caught sight of 
the tiny opening in the forest, a 
rift in the dark ranks of the trees 
and the hint of green beneath. 

He nudged Churchill, pointing. 
Churchill, looking where he 
pointed, nodded and moved the 
wheel, slowly, carefully, tenta- 
tively, as if he were feeling for 
some response of the craft, trying 
to determine if it would respond. 

The flier tilted slightly, wheeled 
and swung, still falling slowly, 
but jockeying for position. For a 
moment it seemed to balk at the 
controls, then slid sidewise, los- 
ing altitude more rapidly, but 
gliding down toward the rift be- 
tween the trees. 

Now the trees rushed upward 
at them and, close above them. 
Maxwell could see the autumn 
color of them — no longer simply 
dark, but a mass of red and gold 
and brown. Long, slender spears 
of red reached up to stab them, 
claw-like hands of gold grasped 
at them with an angry clutch. 

The plane brushed the topmost 
branches of an oak, seemed to 
hesitate, almost to hang there in 
midair, then was gliding in, mush- 
ing toward a landing on the small 
greensward that lay within the 
forest. 

A fairy green Maxwell told 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



himself — a dancing place for 
fairies. But now a landing field. 

He switched his head sidewise 
for a second, saw Churchill 
crouched at the controls, then 
switched back again and watched 
the green come up. 

It should be smooth, he told 
himself. There should be no 
bumps or holes or hummocks. 
For at the time the green had 
been laid down the blueprints 
would have called for smoothness. 

The craft hit and bounced and 
for a terrifying moment teetered 
in the air. Then it was down 
again and running smoothly on 
the green. The trees at the far 
end of the grass were rushing at 
them, coming up too fast. 

“Hang on!” Churchill shouted 
and even as he shouted, the plane 
swung and pivoted, skidding. It 
came to rest a dozen feet from 
the woods that rimmed the green. 

'T'hey sat in deadly silence, a 
silence that seemed to be 
closing in on them from the col- 
ored forest and the rocky bluffs. 

Churchill spoke out of the si- 
lence. “That was close,” he said. 

He reached up and slid back 
the canopy and got out. Maxwell 
followed him. 

“I can’t understand what hap- 
pened,” Churchill said. “This job 
has more fail-safe circuitry built 
into it than you can imagine. 
Get hit by lightning, sure; run 

19 



into a mountain, yes, you can do 
that; get caught in turbulence 
and bounced around, all of this 
could happen, but the motor 
never quits. The only way to stop 
it is to turn it off.” 

He lifted his arm and mopped 
his brow with his already soggy 
shirt sleeve. 

“Did you know about this 
place?” he asked. 

Maxwell shook his head. “Not 
this particular place. I knew there 
were such places. When the res- 
ervation was laid out and land- 
scaped, the planning called for 
greens. Places where the fairies 
dance, you know. I wasn’t look- 
ing for anything, exactly, but 
when I saw the opening in the 
trees I could guess what might 
be down here.” 

“When you showed it to me,” 
said Churchill, “I just hoped you 
knew what you were doing. There 
seemed to be no place else to go, 
so I did some gambling — ” 

Maxwell raised his hand to 
silence him. “What was that?” he 
asked. 

“Sounds like a horse,” said 
Churchill. “Who in the world 
would be out here with a horse? 
It comes from up that way.” 

The clattering and the clopping 
was coming closer. 

They stepped around the flier 
and when, they did, they saw the 
trail that led up to a sharp and 
narrow ridge, with the massive 
20 



bulk of a ruined castle perched 
atop the ridge. 

The horse was coming down 
the trail at a sloppy gallop. Be- 
striding it was a small and dumpy 
figure that bounced most amaz- 
ingly with each motion of its 
mount. It was a far from grace- 
ful rider, with its elbows thrust 
out on either side of it, flapping 
like a pair of wings. 

The horse came tearing down 
the slope and swung out on the 
green. It was no more graceful 
than its rider; but a shaggy plow 
horse and its mighty hoofs, beat- 
ing like great hammers, tore up 
clods of turf and flung them far 
behind it. It came straight at 
the flier, almost as if intent on 
running over it, then at the last 
moment wheeled clumsily and 
came to a shuddering halt, to 
stand with its sides heaving in 
and out like bellows and snort- 
ing through its flabby nostrils. 

Its rider slid awkwardly off 
its back and, when he hit the 
ground, exploded in a gust of 
wrath. 

“It is them no-good bum- 
mers!” he shouted. “It is them 
lousy trolls. I’ve told them and 
I’ve told them to leave them 
broomsticks be. But no, they will 
not listen. They always make the 
joke. They put enchantment on 
them.” 

“Mr. O’Toole,” Maxwell shout- 
ed. “You remember me?” 



GALAXY 



'nphe goblin swung around and 
squinted at him with red- 
filmed, near-sighted eyes. 

“The professor!” he screamed. 
“The good friend of all of us. 
Oh, what an awful shame! I tell 
you, professor, the hides of them 
trolls I shall nail upon the door 
and pin their ears on trees.” 
“Enchantment?” Churchill ask- 
ed. “Do you say enchantment?” 
“What other would it be?” Mr. 
O’Toole fumed. “What else would 
bring a broomstick down out of 
the sky?” 

He ambled closer to Maxwell 
and peered anxiously at him. 
“Can it be really you?” he asked, 
with some solicitude. “In the hon- 
est flesh? We had word that you 
had died. We sent the wreath of 
mistletoe and holly to express 
our deepest grief.” 

“It is I, most truly,” said Max- 
well, slipping easily into the idi- 
om of the Little Folk. “You heard 
rumor only.” 

“Then for sheer joy,” cried Mr. 
O’Toole, “we three shall down 
great tankards of October ale. 
The new batch is ready for the 
running off, and I invite you gen- 
tlemen most cordially to share 
the first of it with me.” 

Other goblins, a half dozen of 
them, were running down the 
path, and Mr. O’Toole waved 
lustily to hurry them along. 

“Always late,” he lamented. 
“Never on the ball. Always show- 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



ing up, but always somewhat 
slightly late. Good boys, all of 
them, with hearts correctly plac- 
ed, but lacking the alertness that 
is the hallmark of true goblins 
such as I.” 

The goblins came loping and 
panting down onto the green, 
ranged themselves expectantly in 
front of Mr. O’Toole. 

“I have jobs for you,” he told 
them. “First you go down to the 
bridge and you tell them trolls 
no more enchantments they shall 
make. They are to cease and de- 
sist entirely. Tell them this is 
their one last chance. If they do 
such things again that bridge we 
shall tear apart, stone by mossy 
stone, and those stones we shall 
scatter far and wide, so there 
never is a chance of upbuilding 
that bridge yet again. And they 
are to uplift the enchantment 
from this fallen broomstick so it 
flies as good as new. 

“And some others of you I 
want to seek the fairies out and 
explain to them the defacement 
of their green, being sure to lay 
all blame for such upon them dir- 
ty trolls and promising the turf 
shall be all fixed smooth and 
lovely for their next dancing 
when the moon is full.” 

“And yet another of you must 
take care of Dobbin, making sure 
his clumsy self does no more 
damage to the green, but letting 
him crop, perchance, a mouthful 

21 



or two of the longer grass if it 
can be found. The poor beast 
does not often get the chance to 
regale himself with pasturage 
such as this.” 

He turned back to Maxwell 
and Churchill, dusting his hands 
together in symbolism of a job 
well done. 

“And now, gentlemen,” he said, 
“you please to climb the hill with 
me, and we will essay what can 
be done with sweet October ale. 
I beg you, however, to go slowly 
in very pity of me, since this 
paunch of mine seems grown 
large of late, and I suffer most 
exceedingly from the shortness of 
the breath.” 

“Lead on, old friend,” said 
Maxwell. “We shall match our 
steps with yours most willingly. 
It has been too long since we 
have quaffed October ale to- 
gether.” 

“Yes, by all means,” said 
Churchill, somewhat weakly. 

Hphey started up the path. Be- 
fore them, looming on the 
ridge, the ruined castle stood 
gaunt against the paleness of the 
sky. 

“I must beforehand apologize,” 
said Mr. O’Toole, “for the con- 
dition of the castle. It is a very 
drafty place, conducive to colds 
and sinus infections and other 
varied miseries. The winds blow 
through it wickedly, and it smells 
22 



of damp and mold. I do not un- 
derstand in fullness why you hu- 
mans, once you build the castles 
for us, do not make them 
weathertight and comfortable. 
Because we, beforetimes, dwelt 
in ruins does not necessarily 
mean that we have forsook all 
comfort and convenience. We 
dwelt in them, forsooth, because 
they were the best poor Europe 
had to offer.” 

He paused to gulp for breath, 
then went on again. “I can well 
recall, two thousand years ago or 
more, we dwelt in brand-new 
castles, poor enough, of course, 
for the rude humans of that time 
could not build the better, being 
all thumbs and without proper 
tools and no machinery at all 
and being, in general, a slab- 
sided race of people. And us forc- 
ed to hide in the nooks and cran- 
nies of the castles since the be- 
nighted humans of that day fear- 
ed and detested us in all their 
ignorance and sought to erect 
great spells against us. 

“Although,” he said, with some 
satisfaction, “mere humans were 
not proficient with the spells. We, 
with no raising of the sweat, 
could afford them spades and 
clubs and beat their spells, hands 
down.” 

“Two thousand years?” asked 
Churchill. “You don’t mean to 
say . .” 

Maxwell made a quick motion 

GALAXY 



of his head in an attempt to 
silence him. 

Mr. O’Toole stopped in the 
middle of the path and threw 
Churchill a withering glance. 

“I can recall,” he said, “when 
the barbarians first came, most 
rudely, from that fenny forest 
you now call Central Europe to 
knock with the hilts of their 
crude iron swords upon the very 
gates of Rome. We heard of it 
in the forest depths where we 
made our homes; and there were 
others then, but dead long since, 
who had heard the news, some 
weeks after its transpirance, from 
Thermopylae.” 

“I am sorry,” Maxwell said. 
“Not every one is as well ac- 
quainted with the Little Folk 

it 

“Please,” said Mr. O’Toole, 
“you acquaint him, then.” 

tCTt’s the truth,” Maxwell said 

-■•to Churchill, “or, at least, it 
could be. Not immortal, for they 
eventually do die. But long-lived 
beyond anything we know. Births 
are few — very few, indeed, for 
if they weren’t there’d not be 
room for them on Earth. But 
they live to an extremely ripe 
old age. 

“It is,” said Mr. O’Toole, “be- 
cause we burrow deep to the 
heart of nature and do not waste 
precious vitality of spirit upon 
those petty concerns which make 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



wreckage of the lives and hopes 
of humans.” 

“But these,” he said, “are dol- 
orous topics on which to waste 
so glorious an autumn afternoon. 
So let us fasten our thoughts, 
rather, with great steadfastness, 
upon the foaming ale that awaits 
us on the hilltop.” 

He lapsed into silence and 
started up the path again at a 
more rapid pace than he had set 
before. 

Scuttling down the path toward 
them came a tiny goblin, his 
multicolored, too - large shirt 
whipping in the wind of his head- 
long running. 

“The ale!” he screamed. “The 
ale!” 

He skidded to a halt in front 
of the three toiling up the path. 

“What of the ale?” panted Mr. 
O’Toole. “Do you mean to con- 
fess to me that you have been 
the sampling of it?” 

“It has gone sour,” wailed the 
little goblin. “The whole bewitch- 
ed mess of it is sour.” 

“But ale can’t go sour,” pro- 
tested Maxwell, grasping some 
sense of the tragedy that had 
taken place. 

Mr. O’Toole bounced upon the 
path in devastating anger. His 
face turned from brown to red to 
purple. His breath came gushing 
out in wheezing gasps. 

“It can, bedamned,” he shout- 
ed, “with a spell of wizardry!” 

23 



He turned around and started 
rapidly down the path, trailed by 
the little goblin. 

“Leave me at them filthy 
trolls!” shouted Mr. O’Toole. 
“Leave me wrap my paws around 
their guzzles. I will dig them out 
with these two hands and hang 
them in the sun to dry. I will 
skin them all entire. I will teach 
them lessons they never will un- 
learn!” 

His bellowing dwindled with 
distance to unintelligible rum- 
bling as he scrambled swiftly 
down the path, heading for the 
bridge beneath which the trolls 
hung out. 

The two humans stood watch- 
ing, filled with admiration and 
wonder at such ponderous, tower- 
ing wrath. 

“Well,” said Churchill, “there 
goes our chance at sweet October 
ale.” 

IV 

'T'he clock in Music Hall began 
striking the hour of six as 
Maxwell reached the outskirts of 
the campus, riding from the air- 
port on one of the slower, outer 
belts of the roadway. Churchill 
had taken another roadway, and 
Maxwell had been glad of that. 
Not only that he felt a faint dis- 
taste for the man, but from the 
wish to be alone. He wanted to 
ride slowly, with the windshield 
24 



down, in silence, without the need 
of conversation, to soak up the 
sight and feel of those few square 
miles of buildings and of malls — 
coming home again to the one 
place that he loved. 

Dusk sifted through the cam- 
pus like a mist of benediction, 
softening the outlines of the 
buildings, turning the malls into 
areas that could have been ro- 
mantic etchings out of story 
books. 

Knots of students stood about 
the malls, talking quietly, carry- 
ing their satchels or with books 
tucked beneath their arms. A 
white-haired man sat on a bench, 
watching a pair of squirrels play- 
ing on the lawn. Two reptilian 
aliens hunched along one of the 
misty walks, moving slowly and 
engrossed in talk. A human stu- 
dent strode smartly along the 
sidewalk, whistling as he went, 
the whistle waking echoes in the 
quiet angles of the buildings. 
Meeting and passing the reptiles, 
he lifted an arm in grave salute. 
And everywhere were the trees, 
great and ancient elms that had 
stood since time forgotten, the 
sturdy sentinels of many gen- 
erations. 

Then the great clock started 
the ringing of the hour, the bronze 
clangor of it beating far across 
the land, and it seemed to Max- 
well that in the clock the campus 
was bidding him hello. The clock 

GALAXY 



was a friend, he thought — not 
to him alone, but to all within 
the hearing of it, the voice of the 
campus. Lying in bed, before he 
went to sleep, he had listened, 
night after night, to its chiming, 
its ringing out of time. And more, 
perhaps, than the ringing out of 
time. Rather a watchman in the 
night crying all was well. 

Ahead of him the mighty com- 
plex of Time College loomed out 
of the dusk — looming up to 
dwarf the roadway and the mall, 
great blocks of plastic and glass, 
with lights burning in many of 
its windows. Squatted at the base 
of the complex, crouched the 
museum and across its front 
Maxwell saw the wind-fluttered 
whiteness of a sign painted on 
white fabric. In the dusk and dis- 
tance he could make out only 
one word: SHAKESPEARE. 

T T e grinned to himself, thinking 
of it. English Lit would be 
beside itself. Old Chenery and all 
the rest of them had never quite 
forgiven Time for establishing, 
two or three years ago, that the 
Earl of Oxford, not Shakespeare, 
had been the author of the plays. 
And this personal appearance of 
the man from Stratford-on-Avon 
would be rubbing salt into 
wounds that were far from healed. 

Far ahead, sitting on its hill at 
the west end of the campus, Max- 
well could make out the great 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



dark hulk of the administration 
section, etched darkly against the 
last faint brushing of red in the 
western sky. 

The belt moved on, past Time 
College and its squatting museum 
with the sign fluttering in the 
wind. The clock ended its telling 
of the time, the last notes of the 
chimes fading far into the dis- 
tance. 

Six o’clock. In another few 
minutes he would be getting off 
the belt and heading for the Win- 
ston Arms, which had been his 
home for the last four — no, the 
last five years. He put his hand 
into the right-hand pocket of his 
jacket, and his fingers traced the 
hard outlines of the small ring of 
keys tucked into the small key 
pocket inside the jacket pocket. 

Now, for the first time since 
he’d left Wisconsin Station, the 
story of that other Peter Maxwell 
forged to the forefront of his 
thoughts. It could be true, of 
course — although it didn’t seem 
too likely. It would be very much 
the kind of trick Security might 
play to crack a man wide open. 
But if it were not true, why had 
there been no report from Coon- 
skin of his failure to arrive? Al- 
though, he realized, that piece of 
information also had come from 
Inspector Drayton, as well as the 
further information that the same 
thing had happened twice before. 
If Drayton could be suspect on 

25 







one story, he also was suspect on 
the other two. If there had been 
other beings picked up by the 
crystal planet, he had certainly 
not been told of them when he 
had been there. But that also, 
Maxwell reminded himself, was 
no trustworthy evidence. Un- 
doubtedly the creatures on the 
crystal planet had told him only 
those things they wanted him to 
know. 

The thing that bothered him 
the most, come to think of it, 
26 



was not what Drayton had said, 
but what Mr. O’Toole had told 
him: We sent the wreath of mis- 
tletoe and holly to express our 
deepest grief. If events had turn- 
ed out differently, he would have 
^talked with his goblin friend 
about it, but the way things went, 
there had been no chance to talk 
of anything at all. 

Tt all could wait, he told him- 
-*• self. In just a little while, once 
he had gotten home, he’d pick 
up a phone and make a call — to 
any one of many people — and 
then he’d know the truth. Who 
should he call? he wondered. 
There was Harlow Sharp, at 
Time, or Dallas Gregg, chairman 
of his own department, or maybe 
Xigmu Maon Tyre, the old Eri- 
danean with the snow-white fur 
and the brooding violet eyes who 
had spent a long lifetime in his 
tiny cubbyhole of an office work- 
ing out an analysis of the struc- 
turing of myths. Or maybe Allen 
Preston, friend and attorney. 
Preston, probably, he told him- 
self, for if what Drayton had told 
him should happen to be true, 
there might be some nasty legal 
questions stemming out of it. 

Impatiently, he snarled at him- 
self. He was believing it, he was 
beginning to believe it; if he kept 
on like this, he could argue him- 
self into thinking that it might 
be true. 



GALAXY 



The Winston Arms was just 
down the street. He got up from 
his seat, picked up his bag and 
stepped to the barely moving 
outer belt. He got off in front of 
the Winston Arms. 

No one was in sight as he 
climbed the broad stone stairs 
and went into the foyer. Fum- 
bling in his pocket, he took out 
the key ring and found the key 
that unlocked the outer door. 
An elevator stood waiting, and he 
got into it and pressed the button 
for the seventh floor. 

The key slid smoothly into the 
lock of his apartment and when 
he twisted it the door came open. 
He stepped into the darkened 
room. Behind him the door swung 
shut automatically, with a snick- 
ing of the lock, and he reached 
out his hand toward the panel 
to snap on the light. 

But with his hand poised to 
press, he stopped. For there was 
something wrong. A feeling, a 
sense of something, a certain 
smell, perhaps. That was it — a 
smell. The faint, delicate odor 
of a strange perfume. 

He smashed his hand against 
the panel, and the lights came up. 

The room was not the same. 
The furniture was different. And 
the screaming paintings on the 
wall — he had never had, he 
would never have paintings such 
as that! 

Behind him the lock snicked 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



again, and he spun around. The 
door swung open and a saber- 
tooth tiger stalked in. 

At the sight of Maxwell, the 
big cat dropped into a crouch 
and snarled, exposing six-inch 
stabbing fangs. 

Gingerly, Maxwell backed 
away. The cat crept closer by a 
foot, still snarling. Maxwell took 
another backward step, felt the 
sudden blow above the ankle, 
tried to twist away, but was un- 
able to, and knew that he was 
falling. He had seen the hassock, 
he should have remembered it 
was there — but he hadn’t. He’d 
backed into it and tripped him- 
self and now he was going over 
flat upon his back. He tried to 
force his body to relax against 
striking on the floor — but he 
didn’t hit the floor. His back 
smashed down into a yielding 
softness, and he knew he’d landed 
on the couch that stood behind 
the hassock. 

The cat was sailing through the 
air in a graceful leap, its ears 
laid back, its mouth half open, 
its massive paws outstretched to 
form a battering ram. Maxwell 
raised his arms in a swift defen- 
sive gesture, but they were brush- 
ed aside as if they’d not been 
there, and the paws smashed 
down into his chest, pinning him 
against the couch. The great cat’s 
head, with its gleaming fangs, 
hung just above his face. Slowly, 

27 



almost gently, the cat lowered its 
head, and a long pink tongue 
came out and slathered, rasping- 
ly, across Maxwell’s face. 

The cat began to purr. 

C £ Qylvester!” cried a voice from 
^ the doorway. “Sylvester, cut 
that out!’’ 

. The cat raked Maxwell’s face 
once again with its moist and 
rasping tongue, then sat back up- 
on its haunches, with a half-grin 
on its face and its ears tipped 
forward, regarding Maxwell with 
a friendly and enthusiastic in- 
terest. 

Maxwell struggled to a half- 
sitting posture, with the small of 
his back resting on the seat cush- 
ions and his shoulders propped 
against the couch’s back. 

“And who might you be?” 
asked the girl standing in the 
doorway. 

“Why, I ” 

“You’ve got your nerve,” she 
said. 

Sylvester purred loudly. 

, “I’m sorry, miss,” said Max- 
well. “But I live here. Or at least, 
I did. Isn’t this 721?” 

“It is, indeed,” she said. “I 
rented it just a week ago.” 
Maxwell shook his head. “I 
•should have known,” he said. 
“The furniture was wrong.” 

“I had the landlord throw out 
the old stuff,” she said. “It simply 
was atrocious.” 

28 



“Let me guess,” said Maxwell. 
“An old green lounger, somewhat 
the worse for wear . ” 

“And a walnut liquor cabinet,” 
said the girl, “and a monstrous 
seascape and . ” 

Maxwell lifted his head wearily. 
“That’s enough,” he said. “That 
was my stuff that you had 
thrown out.” 

“I don’t understand,” said the 
girl. “The landlord said the form- 
er occupant was dead. An acci- 
dent, I think.” 

Maxwell got slowly to his feet. 
The big cat stood up, moved 
closer, rubbed affectionately 
against his legs. 

“Stop that, Sylvester,” said the 
girl. 

Sylvester went on rubbing. 

“You mustn’t mind him,” she 
said. “He’s just a great big baby.” 

“A bio-mech?” 

She nodded. “The cutest thing 
alive. He goes everywhere with 
me. He seldom is a bother. I 
don’t know what’s got into him. 
It seems that he must like you.” 

She had been looking at the 
cat, but now she glanced up 
sharply. 

“Is there something wrong with 
you?” she asked. 

Maxwell shook his head. 

“You’re sort of frosty around 
the gills.” 

“A bit of shock,” he told her. 
“I suppose that’s it. What I told 
you was the truth. I did, at one 

GALAXY 



time, live here. Up until a few 
weeks ago. There was a mix-up 
somehow . ” 

“Sit down,” she said. “Could 
you use a drink?” 

“I suspect I could,” he said. 
“My name is Peter Maxwell, and 
I’m a member of the faculty . .” 
“Wait a moment. You said 
Maxwell? Peter Maxwell. I re- 
member now. That’s the name.” 
“Yes, I know,” said Maxwell. 
“Of the man who died.” 

He sat down carefully on the 
couch. 

“I’ll get the drink,” the girl 
said. 

Qylvester slid closer and gently 
^ laid his massive head in Max- 
well’s lap. Maxwell scratched him 
behind an ear; and, purring loud- 
ly, Sylvester turned his head a 
bit to show Maxwell where it 
itched. 

The girl came with the drink 
and sat down beside him. 

“I still don’t understand,” she 
told him. “If you’re the man 
who — ” 

“The whole thing,” Maxwell 
told her, “becomes somewhat 
complicated.” 

“I must say you’re taking it 
rather well. Shaken up a bit, per- 
haps. But not stricken in a heap.” 
“Well, the fact of the matter 
is,” said Maxwell, “that I half- 
way knew it. I’d been told, you 
see, but I didn’t quite believe it. 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



I suppose the truth is that I 
wouldn’t let myself believe it.” 
He raised the glass. “You’re 
not drinking?” 

“If you’re all right,” she said. 
“If you feel okay, I’ll get one for 
myself.” 

“Oh, I’m all right,” said Max- 
well. “I’ll manage to survive.” 
He looked at her and for the 
first time really saw her — sleek 
and trim, with bobbed black hair, 
long eyelashes, high cheekbones 
and eyes that smiled at him. 
“What’s your name?” he asked. 
“I am Carol Hampton. A his- 
torian at Time.” 

He said, “Miss Hampton, I 
apologize for the situation. I have 
been away — off planet. Just re- 
turned. And I had a key, and 
it fit the door and when I’d left 
it had been my place.” 

“No need to explain,” she said. 
“We’ll have the drink,” he said. 
“Then I’ll get up and go. Un- 
less — ” 

“Unless what?” 

“Unless you’d be willing to 
have dinner with me. Let’s call 
it a way for me to repay your 
understanding. You could have 
run out shrieking.” 

“If this was all a pitch!” die 
said. “If you — ” 

“It couldn’t be,” he said. “I’d 
be too stupid to get it figured 
out. And, besides, how come I 
had the key?” 

She looked at him for a mo- 

29 



ment, then said, “It was silly of 
me. But Sylvester will have to 
go with us. He won’t be left 
alone.” 

“Why,” said Maxwell, “I 
wouldn’t think of leaving him. 
He and I are pals.” 

“It’ll cost you a steak,” she 
warned. “He is always hungry 
and he eats nothing but good 
steaks. Big ones. Raw.” 

V 

*T*he Pig 8s Whistle was dark 
and clamorous and smoky. 
The tables were jammed together, 
with narrow lanes between them. 
Candles burned with flickering 
flames. The murmurous din of 
many voices, seemingly talking 
all at once, filled the low-ceil- 
inged room. 

Maxwell stopped and peered, 
trying to locate a table that might 
be vacant. There wasn’t any. But 
he wanted to eat here. The place 
was a hangout of students and 
some members of the faculty; it 
spelled the campus to him. 

He said to Carol Hampton, 
“Perhaps we should go some- 
where else.” 

“There’ll be someone along in 
just a minute,” she said, “to show 
us to a table. Everyone seems .so 
busy. There must have been a 
rush — Sylvester! Cut that out!” 

She spoke appealingly to the 
people at the table beside which 
30 



they stood. “You’ll excuse him, 
please. He has no manners, none 
at all. Especially table manners. 
He snatches everything in sight.” 
Sylvester licked his chops, 
looking satisfied. 

“Think nothing of it, miss,” 
said the man with the bushy 
beard. “I really didn’t want it. 
To order steak is just compul- 
sive with me.” 

Someone shouted- across the 
room. “Pete! Pete Maxwell!” 
Maxwell peered into the gloom. 
At a far table, inserted in a cor- 
ner, someone had risen and was 
waving his arms. Maxwell finally 
made him out. It was Alley Oop, 
and beside him sat the white- 
shrouded figure of Ghost. 

“Friends of yours?” asked Car- 
ol. 

“Yes. Apparently they want us 
to join them. Do you mind?” 
“The Neanderthaler?” she ask- 
ed. 

“You know him?” 

“No. I just see him around at 
times. But I’d like to meet him. 
And that is the Ghost?” 

“The two are inseparable,” said 
Maxwell. 

“Well, let’s go over, then.” 

“We can say hello and go 
somewhere else.” 

“Not on your life,” she said. 
“This place looks interesting.” 
“You’ve never been here be- 
fore?” 

“I’ve never dared,” she said. 

GALAXY 



“I’ll break the path,” he told 
her. 

He forged slowly among the 
tables, trailed by the girl and 
cat. 

A lley Oop lunged out into the 
aisle to meet him, flung his 
arms around him, hugged him, 
then grasped him by the shoul- 
ders and thrust him out at arms- 
length to stare into his face. 

“You are Old Pete?” he asked. 
“You aren’t fooling us?” 

“I am Pete,” said Maxwell. 
“Who do you think I am?” 

“Well, what I want to know 
then,” said Oop, “is who in hell 
it was we buried three weeks ago 
last Thursday. Both me and 
Ghost were there. And you owe 
us twenty bucks refund on the 
flowers we sent. That is what 
they cost us.” 

“Let us sit down,” said Max- 
well. 

“Afraid of creating a scene,” 
said Oop. “Hell, this place is 
made for scenes. There are fist 
fights every hour, and there’s al- 
ways someone jumping up on a 
table and making a speech.” 

“Oop,” said Maxwell, “there is 
a lady present, and I want you to 
tame down and get civilized. Miss 
Carol Hampton, this great oaf is 
Alley Oop.” 

“I am delighted to meet you, 
Miss Hampton,” said Alley Oop. 
“And what it that you have there 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



with you? As I live and breathe, 
a saber-toother! I’ll have to tell 
you about the time, during a bliz- 
zard, I sought shelter in a cave 
and this big cat was there and 
me with nothing but a dull stone 
knife. I had lost my club, you 
see, when I met the bear, and — ” 

“Some other time,” said Max- 
well. “At least, let us sit down. 
We are hungry. We don’t want 
to get thrown out.” 

“Pete,” said Alley Oop, “it is 
a matter of some large distinc- 
tion to be heaved out of this joint. 
You ain’t arrived socially other- 
wise.” 

But, muttering under his 
breath, he led the way back to 
the table and held a chair for 
Carol. Sylvester planted himself 
between Maxwell and Carol, 
propped his chin on the table 
and glared balefully at Oop. 

“That cat don’t like me,” Oop 
declared. “Probably he knows 
how many of his ancestors I 
wiped out back in the Old Stone 
Age.” 

“He’s only a bio-mech,” said 
Carol. “He couldn’t possibly.” 

“I don’t believe a word of it,” 
said Oop. “That critter is no bio- 
mech. He’s got the dirty mean- 
ness in his eyes all saber -toothers 
have.” 

“Please, Oop,” said Maxwell 
“Just a moment, please. Miss 
Hampton, this gentleman is 
Ghost A long-time friend.” 

31 



“I am pleased to meet you, 
Mr. Ghost,” said Carol. 

“Not mister,” said Ghost. “Just 
plain Ghost. That is all I am. 
And the terrible thing about it is 
that I don’t know who I am the 
ghost of. I’m most pleased to 
meet you. It is so comfortable 
with four around the table. There 
is something nice and balanced 
in the number four.” 

“Well, now,” said Oop, “that 
we know one another, leave us 
proceed to business. Let us do 
some drinking. It’s lonesome for 
a man to drink all by himself. I 
love Ghost, of course, for his 
many sterling qualities, but I hate 
a man who doesn’t drink.” 

tC'V/'ou know I can’t drink,” 
^ said Ghost. “Nor eat, 
either. Or smoke. There’s not 
much a ghost can do. But I wish 
you wouldn’t keep pointing it out 
to everyone we meet.” 

Oop said to Carol, “You seem 
to be surprised that a barbaric 
Neanderthaler can sling the lan- 
guage around with the facility I 
command.” 

“Not surprised,” said Carol. 
“Astounded.” 

“Oop,” Maxwell told her, “has 
soaked up more education in the 
last twelve years than most or- 
dinary men. Started out virtually 
in kindergarten and now is work- 
ing on his doctorate. And the 
thing about it is that he intends 
32 



to keep right on. You might say 
he is one of our most notable 
professional students.” 

Oop raised his arm and waved 
it, bellowing at a waiter. “Over 
here,” he shouted. “There are 
people here who wish to patron- 
ize you. All dying of slow thirst.” 
“The thing,” said Ghost, “I 
have always admired about him 
is his shy, retiring nature.” 

“I keep on studying,” said Oop, 
“not so much that I hunger after 
knowledge as for the enjoyment 
I get from the incredulous aston- 
ishment on the faces of those 
stuffed-shirt professors and those 
goofy students. Not,” he said to 
Maxwell, “that I maintain all 
professors are stuffed shirts.” 
“Thank you,” Maxwell said. 
“There are those who seem to 
think,” said Oop, “that Homo 
sapien neanderthalensis can be 
nothing other than a stupid brute. 
After all, he became extinct, he 
couldn’t hold his own — which 
in itself is prime evidence that he 
was very second rate. I’m afraid 
that I’ll continue to devote my 
life to proving — ” 

The waiter appeared at Oop’s 
elbow. “It’s you again,” he said. 
“I might have known when you 
yelled at me. You have no breed- 
ing, Oop.” 

“We have a man here,” Oop 
told him, ignoring the insult, “who 
has come back from the dead. 
I think it would be fitting that 

GALAXY 



we should celebrate his resur- 
rection with a flourish of good 
fellowship.” 

“You want something to drink, 
I take it.” 

“Why,” said Oop, “don’t you 
simply bring a bottle of good 
booze, a bucket of ice and four 
— no, three glasses. Ghost doesn’t 
drink, you know.” 

“I know,” the waiter said. 
“That is,” said Oop, “unless 
Miss Hampton wants one of these 
fancy drinks . ” 

“Who am I to gum up the 
works?” asked Carol. “What is it 
you are drinking?” 

“Bourbon,” said Oop. “Pete 
and I have a lousy taste in li- 
quor.” 

“Bourbon let it be,” said Carol. 
“I take it,” said the waiter, 
“that when I lug the bottle over 
here, you’ll have the cash to pay 
for it. I remember the time — ” 
“Whatever I may lack,” said 
Oop, “will be forthcoming from 
Old Pete.” 

“Pete?” The waiter glanced at 
Maxwell. “Professor!” he ex- 
claimed. “I had heard that 
you — ” 

“That’s what I been trying to 
tell you,” said Oop. “That’s what 
we’re celebrating. He came back 
from the dead.” 

“But I don’t understand.” 
“You don’t need to,” said Oop. 
“Just rustle up the booze.” 

The waiter scurried off. 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



“And now,” said Ghost to Max- 
well, “please tell us what you 
are. You are no ghost, apparent- 
ly. Or if you are, there’s been a 
vast improvement in procedure 
since the man I represent shuffled 
off his mortal coil.” 

VI 

4 4 Tt seems,” Maxwell told them, 
-*■ “that I’m a split personality. 
One of me, I understand, got in 
an, accident and died.” 

“But that’s impossible,” said 
Carol. “Split personality in the 
mental sense — sure, that can be 
understood. But physically — ” 
“There’s nothing in heaven or 
Earth,” said Ghost, “that is im- 
possible.” 

“That’s a bad quotation,” said 
Oop, “and, besides, you misquot- 
ed it.” 

He put a hand to his hairy 
chest and scratched vigorously 
with blunt fingers. 

“You needn’t look so horrified,” 
he said to Carol. “I itch. I’m a 
brute creature of nature, there- 
fore I scratch. And I’m not nak- 
ed, either. I have a pair of shorts 
on.” 

“He’s house-broken,” said 
Maxwell, “but just barely.” 

“To get back to this split per- 
sonality,” said the girl, “can you 
tell us what actually did hap- 
pen?” 

“I set out for one of the Coon- 

33 



skin planets,” said Maxwell, “and 
along the way somehow my wave 
pattern duplicated itself, and I 
wound up in two places.” 

“You mean there were two Pete 
Maxwells?” 

“That’s the way of it.” 

“If I were you,” said Oop, “I’d 
sue them. These Transportation 
people get away with murder. 
You could shake them down for 
plenty. Me and Ghost could tes- 
tify for you. We went to your 
funeral. 

“As a matter of fact,” he said, 
“I think Ghost and I should sue 
as well. For mental anguish. Our 
best friend cold and rigid in his 
casket and us prostrate with 
grief.” 

“We really were, you know,” 
said Ghost. 

“I have no doubt of it,” said 
Maxwell. 

“I must say,” said Coral, “that 
all three of you take it rather 
lightly.” 

“What do you want of us?” 
demanded Oop. “Sing hallelujahs, 
perhaps? Or bug out our eyes 
and be filled with the wonder of 
it? We lost a pal, and now he’s 
back again.” 

“But one of him is dead!” 

“Well,” said Oop, “so far as we 
were concerned, there was never 
more than one of him. And may- 
be this is better. Imagine the em- 
barrassing situations that could 
develop if there were two of him/’ 
34 



Carol turned to Maxwell. “And 
you?” she asked. 

Lie shook his head. “In a day 
or two, I’ll take some seri- 
ous thought of it. Right now, I 
guess, I’m putting off thinking 
about it. To tell you the truth, 
when I do think about it, I get 
a little numb. But tonight I’ve 
got a pretty girl and two old 
friends and a great big pussy 
cat and a bottle of liquor to get 
rid of and later on some food.” 

He grinned at her. She shrug- 
ged. 

“I never saw such a crazy 
bunch,” she said. “I believe I like 
it.” 

“I like it, too,” said Oop. “Say 
whatever you will of it, this civ- 
ilization of yours is a vast im- 
provement over the days of yore. 
It was the luckiest day of my 
life when a Time team snatched 
me hence just at the point when 
some of my loving brother tribes- 
men were about to make a meal 
of me. Not that I blame them 
particularly, you understand. It 
had been a long, hard winter and 
the snow was deep and the game 
had been very scarce. And there 
were certain members of the tribe 
who felt they had a score or two 
to settle with me. And I’ll not 
kid you; they may have had a 
score. I was about to be knocked 
upon the head and, so to speak, 
dumped into the pot.”

“Cannibalism!” Carol said, 
horrified. 

“Why, naturally,” he told her. 
“In those rough and ready days, 
it was quite acceptable. But, of 
course, you wouldn’t understand. 
You’ve never been really hungry, 
I take it. Gut hungry. So shrivel- 
ed up with hunger — ” 

He halted his talk and looked 
around. 

“The thing that is most com- 
forting about this culture,” he 
declared, “is the abundance of 
the food. Back in the old days 
we had our ups and downs. We’d 
bag a mastodon and we’d eat 
until we vomited and then we’d 
eat some more.” 

Ghost said, warningly, “I 
doubt that this is a proper sub- 
ject for dinner conversation.” 

Oop glanced at Carol. 

“You must say this much for 
me,” he insisted. “I’m honest. 
When I mean vomit, I say vomit 
and not regurgitate.” 

The waiter brought the liquor, 
thumping the bottle and the ice 
bucket down upon the table. 

“You want to order now?” he 
asked. 

“We ain’t decided yet,” said 
Oop, “if we’re going to eat in this 
crummy joint. It’s all right to get 
liquored up in, but — ” 

“Then, sir,” the waiter said, 
and laid down the check. 

Oop dug into his pockets and 
came up with cash. Maxwell pull- 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



ed the bucket and the bottle close 
and began fixing drinks. 

“We’re going to eat here, aren’t 
we?” asked Carol. “If Sylvester 
doesn’t get that steak you prom- 
ised him, I don’t know what will 
happen. He’s been so patient and 
so good, with the smell of all 
the food . ” 

“He’s already had one steak,” 
Maxwell pointed out. “How much 
can he eat?” 

“An unlimited amount,” said 
Oop. “In the old days one of 
them monsters would polish off 
an elk in a single sitting. Did I 
ever tell you — ” 

“Yes,” said Ghost. 

“But that was a cooked steak,” 
protested Carol, “and he likes 
them raw. Besides, it was a small 
one.” 

“Oop,” said Maxwell, “get 
that waiter back here. You are 
good at it. You have the voice 
for it.” 

/~\op signaled with a brawny 
arm and bellowed. He waited 
for a moment, then bellowed once 
again, without results. 

“He won’t pay attention to 
me,” Oop growled. “Maybe it’s 
not our waiter. I never am able 
to tell them monkeys apart. They 
all look alike to me.” 

“I don’t like the crowd to- 
night,” said Ghost. “I have been 
watching it. There’s trouble in 
the air.”

“What is wrong with it?” asked 
Maxwell. 

“There are an awful lot of 
creeps from English Lit. This is 
not their hangout. Mostly the 
crowd here are Time and Super- 
natural. 

“You mean this Shakespeare 
business?” 

“That might be it,” said Ghost. 

Maxwell handed Carol her 
drink, pushed another across the 
table to Oop. 

"It seems a shame,” Carol said 
to Ghost, “not to give you one. 
Couldn’t you even sniff it, just 
a little.” 

“Don’t let it bother you,” said 
Oop. “The guy gets drunk on 
moonbeams. He can dance on 
rainbows. He has a lot of advan- 
tages you and I don’t have. For 
one thing, he’s immortal. What 
could kill a ghost?” 

“I’m not sure of that,” said 
Ghost. 

“There’s one thing that bothers 
me,” said Carol. “You don’t 
mind, do you?” 

“Not at all,” said Ghost. 

“It’s this business of you not 
knowing who you are the ghost 
of. Is that true or is it just a 
joke?” 

“It is true,” said Ghost. “And 
I don’t mind telling you, it’s em- 
barrassing and confusing. But 
I’ve just plain forgotten. From 
England — that much, at least, 
I know. But the name I can’t 
36 



recall. I would suspect most other 
ghosts would know that much.” 

“We have no other ghosts,” 
said Maxwell. “Contacts with 
other ghosts, of course, and con- 
versations and interviews with 
them. But no other ghost has 
ever come to live with us. Why 
did you do it, Ghost — come to 
live with us?” 

“He’s a natural chiseler,” said 
Oop. “Always figuring out the 
angles.” 

“You’re wrong there,” Maxwell 
said. “It’s damned little we can 
do for Ghost.” 

Said Ghost, “You give me a 
sense of reality.” 

“Well, no matter what the rea- 
son,” said Maxwell, “I am glad 
you did it.” 

“The three of you,” said Carol, 
“have been friends for a long, 
long time.” 

“And it seems strange to you?” 
asked Oop. 

“Well, yes, maybe it does,” 
she said. 

Qounds of scuffling came from 
^the front of the place. Carol 
and Maxwell turned around in 
their chairs to look toward it, but 
there wasn’t much that one could 
see. 

A man suddenly loomed on top 
of the table and began to sing: 

“Hurrah for Old Bill Shakes- 
peare, 

“He never wrote them plays. 

GALAXY 



“He stayed at home and, chas- 
ing girls, 

Sang dirty rondelays!” 

Jeers and catcalls broke out 
from over the room, and someone 
threw something that went sail- 
ing past the singer. Part of the 
crowd took up the song: 

“Hurrah for Old Bill Shakes- 
peare; 

“He never wrote them . 

Someone with a bull voice 
howled: “To hell with Old Bill 
Shakespeare!” 

The room exploded into action. 
Chairs went over. There were 
other people on top of tables. 
Shouts reverberated, and there 
was shoving and pushing. Fists 
began to fly. Various items went 
sailing through the air. 

Maxwell sprang to his feet, 
reached out an arm and swept it 
back, shoving Carol behind him. 
Oop came charging across the 
table top with a wild warwhoop. 
His foot caught the bucket and 
sent the ice cubes flying. 

“I’ll mow ’em down,” he yelled 
at Maxwell. “You pile ’em to one 
side!” 

Maxwell saw a fist coming at 
him out of nowhere and ducked 
to one side, bringing his own fist 
up in a vicious jab, hitting out at 
nothing, but aiming in the direc- 
tion from which the fist had 
come. Over his shoulder came 
Oop’s brawny arm, with a mas- 
sive fist attached. It smacked in- 
38 



to a face with a splattering sound, 
and out beyond the table a figure 
went slumping to the floor. 

Something heavy and travel- 
ing fast caught Maxwell behind 
the ear, and he went down. Feet 
surged all around him. Someone 
stepped on his hand. Someone 
fell on top of him. Above him, 
seemingly from a long ways off, 
he heard Oop’s wild whooping. 

Twisting around, he shoved off 
the body that had fallen across 
him and staggered to his feet. 

A hand grabbed him by the 
elbow and twisted him around. 

“Let’s get out of here,” said 
Oop. “Someone will get hurt.” 

Carol was backed against the 
table, bent over, with her hands 
clutching the scruff of Sylvester’s 
neck. Sylvester was standing on 
his hind legs and pawing the air 
with his forelegs. Snarls were 
rumbling in his throat, and his 
long fangs gleamed. 

“If we don’t get him out of 
here,” said Oop, “that cat will 
get his steak.” 

He swooped down and wrap- 
ped an arm around the cat, lifting 
him by the middle, hugging him 
tight against his chest. 

“Take care of the girl,” Oop 
told Maxwell. “There’s a back 
door around here somewhere. 
And don’t leave that bottle be- 
hind. We’ll need it later on.” 

Maxwell reached out and grab- 
bed the bottle. 



GALAXY 



There was no sign of Ghost. 
VII 

CCT’m a coward,” Ghost con- 
■“•fessed. “I admit that I turn 
chicken at the sight of violence.” 
“And you,” said Oop, “the one 
guy in the world no one can lay 
a mitt on.” 

They sat at the rude, square, 
rickety table that Oop once, in 
a moment of housekeeping ener- 
gy, had knocked together from 
rough boards. Carol pushed away 
her plate. “I was starved,” she 
said, “but not any more.” 

“You’re not the only one,” said 
Oop. “Look at our putty cat.” 
Sylvester was curled up in 
front of the fireplace, his bobbed 
tail clamped down tight against 
his rump, his furry paws cover- 
ing his nose. His whiskers stirred 
gently as his breath went in and 
out. 

“That’s the first time in my 
life,” said Oop, “I ever saw a 
saber-toother have more than he 
could eat.” 

He reached out for the bottle 
and shook it. It had an empty 
sound. He lumbered to his feet 
and went across the floor, knelt 
and raised a small door set into 
the floor, reaching down with 
his arm and searching in the 
space underneath the door. He 
brought up a glass fruit jar and 
set it to one side. He brought 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



up a second fruit jar and set it 
beside the first. Finally he came 
up triumphantly with a bottle. 

He put the fruit jars back and 
closed the door. Back at the table, 
he snapped the sealer off the bot- 
tle and reached out to pour 
drinks. 

“You guys don’t want ice,” he 
said. “It just dilutes the booze. 
Besides, I haven’t any.” 

He jerked a thumb back to- 
ward the door hidden in the floor. 
“My cache,” he said. “I keep a 
jug or two hid out. Some day I 
might break a leg or something 
and the doc would say I couldn’t 
drink.” 

“Not because of a broken leg,” 
said Ghost. 

“Well, then, something else,” 
said Oop. 

They sat contentedly with their 
drinks. Ghost staring at the fire. 
Outside a rising wind worried 
at the shack. 

“I’ve never had a better meal,” 
said Carol. “First time I ever 
cooked my own steak stuck on 
a stick above an open fire.” 

Oop belched contentedly. 
“That’s the way we did it back 
in the Old Stone Age. That, or 
eat it raw, like the saber-toother. 
We didn’t have no stoves or 
ovens or fancy things like that.” 

“I have the feeling,” said Max- 
well, “that it would be better not 
to ask, but where did you get 
that rack of ribs? I imagine all 

39 



the butcher shops were closed.” 
“Well, they were,” admitted 
Oop, “but there was this one with 
a back door that had this itty 
bitty padlock . ” 

“Some day,” said Ghost, “you’ll 
get into trouble.” 

/^\op shook his head. “I don’t 
think so. Not this time. 
Primal necessity — no, I guess 
that’s not the phrase. When a 
man is hungry he has a right to 
food anywhere he finds it. That 
was the law back in prehistoric 
days. I imagine you still might 
make a case of it in a court of 
law. Besides, tomorrow I’ll go 
back and explain what happened. 
By the way,” he said to Maxwell, 
“have you any money?” 

“I’m loaded,” Maxwell told 
him. “I carried expense money 
for the Coonskin trip and I never 
spent a cent of it.” 

“On this other planet you were 
a guest,” said Carol. 

“I suppose I was,” said Max- 
well. “I never did figure out our 
exact relationship.” 

“They were nice people?” 
“Well. Yes, nice — but people, 
I don’t know.” 

He turned to Oop. “How much 
will you need?” 

“I figure a hundred ought to 
settle it. There is the meat and 
the busted door, not to mention 
the bruised feelings of our friend, 
the butcher.” 



Maxwell took his billfold from 
his pocket and, counting out 
some bills, handed them to Oop. 

“Thanks,” said Oop. “Some 
day I’ll pay you back.” 

“No,” said Maxwell. “The par- 
ty is on me. I started out to take 
Carol to dinner, and things got 
somewhat upset.” 

On the hearth, Sylvester 
stretched and yawned, then went 
back to sleep, lying on his back 
now, with his legs sticking in the 
air. 

Ghost asked, “You’re on a visit 
here, Miss Hampton?” 

“No,” said Carol, surprised. “I 
work here. What gave you that 
idea?” 

“The tiger,” said Ghost. “A 
bio-mech, you said. I thought, 
naturally, you were with Bio- 
mech.” 

“I see,” said Carol. “Vienna 
or New York.” 

“There is a center also,” said 
Ghost, “somewhere in Asia. Ulan 
Bator, if my memory is correct.” 

“You’ve been there?” 

“No,” said Ghost. “I only heard 
of it.” 

“But he could,” said Oop. “He 
can go anywhere. In the blinking 
of an eyelash. That’s why the 
folks at Supernatural continue to 
put up with him. They hope that 
some day they can come up with 
whatever he has got. But Old 
Ghost is cagey. He’s not telling 
them.”

up something for yourself, it 
costs money to have something 
like that saber-toother.” 

‘‘Oh, I see,” said Carol. “I 
guess there’s truth in that. They 
do cost a lot of money. But I 
haven’t got that kind of money. 
My father, before he retired, was 
in Bio-mech. New York. Sylvest- 
er was a joint project of a semin- 
ar he headed. The students gave 
him to my Dad.” 

“I still don’t believe,” said Oop, 
“that cat’s a bio-mech. He’s got 
that dirty glitter in his eyes when 
he looks at me.” 

“As a matter of fact,” Carol 
told him, “there is a lot more 
bio than mech in all of them to- 
day. The name originated when 
what amounted to a highly so- 
phisticated electronic brain and 
nervous system was housed in 
specific protoplasms. But today 
about the only mechanical things 
about them are those organs that 
are likely to wear out if they were 
made of tissue. The heart, the 
kidneys, the lungs, things like 
that. What is being done at Bio- 
mech today is the actual crea- 
tions of specific life forms — but 
you all know that, of course.” 
“There are some strange stor- 
ies,” Maxwell said. “A group of 
supermen, kept under lock and 
key. You have heard of that?” 
“Yes, heard of it,” she said. 
“There are always rumors.” 
“The best one that I’ve heard 

41 



“The real reason for his si- 
lence,” said Maxwell, “is that 
he’s on Transport payroll. It’s 
worth their while to keep him 
quiet. If he revealed his travel- 
ing techniques, Transport would 
go broke. No more need of them. 
People just up and go anywhere 
they wished, on their own — a 
mile or a million light-years.” 
“And he’s the soul of tact,” 
said Oop. “What he was getting 
at back there was that unless you 
are in Bio-mech and can cook 



in recent days,” said Oop, “really 
is a lulu. Someone told me Super- 
natural has made contact with 
the Devil. How about that, Pete?” 

tCT wouldn’t know,” said Max- 

^ well. “I suppose someone 
has tried. I’m almost sure some- 
one must have tried. It’s such an 
obvious thing for one to have 
a go at.” 

“You mean,” asked Carol, 
“that there might really be a 
Devil?” 

“Two centuries ago,” said 
Maxwell, “people asked, in exact- 
ly the same tone of voice you are 
now, if there actually were such 
things as trolls and goblins.” 

“And ghosts,” said Ghost. 

“You’re serious!” Carol cried. 

“Not serious,” said Maxwell. 
“Just not ready to foreclose even 
on the Devil.” 

“This is a marvelous age,” de- 
clared Oop, “as I am sure you’ve 
heard me indicate before. You’ve 
done away with superstition and 
old wives’ tales. You search in 
them for truth. But my people 
knew there were trolls and gob- 
lins and all the rest of them. The 
stories of them, you understand, 
were always based on fact. Ex- 
cept that later on, when he out- 
grew his savage simplicity, if you 
can call it that, man denied the 
fact; could not allow himself to 
believe these things that he knew 
were true. So he varnished them 
42 



over and hid them safe away in 
the legend and the myth and 
when the human population kept 
on increasing, these creatures 
went into deep hiding. As well 
they might have, for there was 
a time when they were not the 
engaging creatures you seem to 
think they are today.” 

Ghost asked: “And the Devil?” 
“I’m not sure,” said Oop. 
“Maybe. But I can’t be sure. 
There were all these things you 
have lured out and rediscovered 
and sent to live on their reserva- 
tions. But there were many more. 
Some fearful, all a nuisance.” 
“You don’t seem to have liked 
them very well,” Carol observed. 

“Miss,” said Oop, “I didn’t. I 
hated the little bastards’ guts.” 
“It would seem to me,” said 
Ghost, “that this would be a fer- 
tile field for some Time investi- 
gation. Apparently there were 
many different kinds of these — 
would you call them primates?” 
“I think you might,” said Max- 
well. 

“Primates of a different stripe 
than the apes and man.” 

“Of a very different stripe,” 
said Oop. “Vicious little stink- 
ers. 

“Some day, I m sure,” said 
Carol, “Time will get around to 
it. They know it, of course?” 
“They should,” said Oop. “I’ve 
told them often enough, with ap- 
propriate description.” 



GALAXY 



“Time has too much to do,” 
Maxwell reminded them. “Too 
many areas of interest And the 
entire past to cover.” 

“And no money to do it with,” 
said Carol. 

“There,” declared Maxwell, 
“speaks a loyal Time staff mem- 
ber.” 

CCT) u t it’s true,” she cried. “The 
other disciplines could 
learn so much by time investiga- 
tion. You can’t rely on written 
history. It turns out, in many 
cases, to be different than it ac- 
tually was. A matter of emphasis 
or bias or of just poor interpreta- 
tion, embalmed forever in the 
written form. But do these other 
departments provide any funds 
for time investigations? I’ll an- 
swer that. They don’t. A few of 
them, of course. The College of 
Law has co-operated splendidly, 
but not many of the others. 
They’re afraid. They don’t want 
their comfortable little worlds up- 
set. Take this matter of Shake- 
speare, for example. You’d think 
English Lit would be grateful to 
find that Oxford wrote the plays. 
After all, it had been a question 
which had been talked about for 
many years — who really wrote 
the plays? But, after all of that, 
they resented it when Time found 
out.” 

“And now,” said Maxwell, 
“Time is bringing Shakespeare 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



forward to lecture about how he 
didn’t write the plays. Don’t you 
think that’s rubbing it in just a 
bit too much?” 

“That’s not the point of it, at 
all,” said Carol. “The point is 
that Time is forced to make a 
sideshow out of history to earn 
a little money. That’s the way it 
is all the time. All sorts of 
schemes for raising money. Earn- 
ing a lousy reputation as a bunch 
of clowns. You can’t believe Dean 
Sharp enjoys — ” 

“I know Harlow Sharp,” said 
Maxwell. “Believe me, he enjoys 
every minute of it.” 

“That is blasphemy,” Oop said, 
in mock horror. “Don’t you know 
that you can be crucified for 
blabbing off like that?” 

“You’re making fun of me,” 
said Carol. “You make fun of 
everyone, of everything. You, too, 
Peter Maxwell.” 

“I apologize for them,” said 
Ghost, “since neither one of them 
could summon up the grace to 
apologize, themselves. You have 
to live with them for ten or fif- 
teen years to understand they 
really mean no harm.” 

“But the day will come,” said 
Carol, “when Time will have the 
funds to do whatever it may 
want. All their pet projects and 
to hell with all the other colleges. 
When the deal goes — ” 

She stopped abruptly. She sat 
frozen, not moving. One could 

43 



sense that she wanted to put her 
hand up to her mouth and was 
refraining from it only by iron 
will. 

4 4TX7'hat deal?” asked Max- 
VV well. 

‘‘I think I know,” said Oop. “I 
heard a rumor, just a tiny little 
rumor and I paid no attention to 
it. Although, come to think of it, 
these dirty little rumors are the 
ones that turn out to be true. The 
great big, ugly, noisy ones — ” 
“Oop, not a speech,” said 
Ghost. “Just tell us what you 
heard.” 

“It’s incredible,” said Oop. 
“You never would believe it. Not 
in all your born days.” 

“Oh, stop it!” Carol exclaimed. 
They all looked at her and 
waited. 

“I made a slip,” she said “I 
got all worked up and made a 
slip. Can I ask the three of you 
just please to forget it? I’m not 
even sure it’s true.” 

“Certainly,” said Maxwell. 
“You’ve been exposed this eve- 
ning to rough company and ill 
manners and . ” 

She shook her head. “No,” she 
said. “No, it’s not any good to 
ask. I have no right to ask. I’ll 
simply have to tell you and trust 
to your discretion. And I’m pretty 
sure it’s true. Time has made an 
offer for the Artifact.” 

Silence reverberated in the 
44 



room as the other three sat mo- 
tionless, scarcely breathing. She 
looked from one to the other of 
them, not quite understanding. 

Finally Ghost stirred slightly, 
and there was a rustling in the 
silence of the room, as if his white 
sheet had been an actual sheet 
that rustled when he moved. 

“You do not comprehend,” he 
said, “the attachment that we 
three hold to the Artifact.” 

“You struck us in a heap,” said 
Oop. 

“The Artifact,” said Maxwell, 
softly. “The Artifact, the one 
great mystery, the one thing in 

the world that has baffled every- 

_ _ _ » 

one .... 

“A funny stone,” said Oop. 

“Not a stone,” said Ghost. 

“Then, perhaps,” said Carol, 
“you’ll tell me what it is.” 

And that was the one thing, 
Maxwell told himself, that Ghost 
nor no one else could do. Discov- 
ered ten years or so ago by Time 
investigators on a hilltop in the 
Jurassic Age, it had been brought 
back to the present at a great ex- 
penditure of funds and ingenuity. 
Its weight had demanded energy 
far beyond anything so far en- 
countered to kick it forward into 
time, an energy requirement 
which had made necessary the 
projection backward in time of a 
portable nuclear generator, 
transported in many pieces and 
assembled on the site. And then 

GALAXY 



the further task of bringing back 
the generator, since nothing of 
that sort, as a matter of simple 
ethics, could be abandoned in the 
past — even in the past of the 
far Jurassic. 

“I cannot tell you,” said Ghost. 
“There is no one who can tell 
you.” 

Ghost was right. No one had 
been able to make any sense of 
it at all. A massive block of some 
sort of material that now ap- 
peared to be neither stone nor 
metal, although at one time it 
had been thought to be a stone, 
and later on, a metal. It had de- 
fied all investigation. Six feet 
long, four feet on each side, it 
was a mass of blackness that ab- 
sorbed no energy and emitted 
none, that bounced all light and 
other radiation from its surface, 
that could not be cut or dented, 
stopping a laser beam as neatly 
as if the beam had not existed. 
There was nothing that could 
scratch it, nothing that could 
probe it. It gave up no informa- 
tion of any sort at all. It rested 
on its raised base in the forecourt 
of Time Museum, the one thing 
in the world about which no one 
could even make a valid guess. 

“Then,” asked Carol, “why the 
consternation?” 

“Because,” said Oop, “Pete 
here has the hunch it may, at 
one time, have been the god of 
the Little Folk. That is, if the 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



lousy little stinkers had the ca- 
pacity to recognize a god.” 

“I’m sorry,” Carol said. “I am 
truly sorry. I didn’t know. Per- 
haps if Time knew . 

“There’s not enough data,” 
Maxwell said, “to make any talk 
about it. Just a hunch is all. Just 
a feeling from certain things I’ve 
heard among the Little Folk. But 
even they don’t know. It was bo 
long ago.” 

So long ago, he thought. For 
the love of God, almost two 
hundred million years ago!

CC'Tphis Oop,” said Carol. “I 
can’t get over him. That 
funny house he has out at the 
end of nowhere.” 

“He’d be offended,” said Max- 
well, “if he heard you calling it 
a house. It’s a shack, and he’s 
proud of it — as a shack. The 
jump from cave to house would 
have been too great for him. He’d 
have felt uncomfortable.” 

“A cave? He really lived in a 
cave?” 

“Let me tell you something 
about old friend Oop,” said Max- 
well. “He is an awful liar. You 
can’t believe all the stories that 
he tells. The cannibalism, for in- 
stance . .” 

“That makes me feel a little 
better. People eating one an- 
other!” 

45 



“Oh, there was cannibalism, all 
right. There is no doubt of that. 
But whether Oop himself was 
headed for the pot is another 
matter. On items of general in- 
formation, he is reliable enough. 
It’s only when he gets to yarn- 
ing about his personal experiences 
that you should begin to doubt 
him.” 

“It’s funny,” said Carol. “I’ve 
seen him around and have won- 
dered a bit about him, but I 
never thought I’d meet him. 
Never really wanted to, in fact. 
Certain people I can draw a line 
at, and he was one of them. I 
imagined he would be un- 
couth — ” 

“Oh, he’s uncouth,” said Max- 
well. 

“But charming, too,” said Car- 
ol. 

Clear autumn stars shone frost- 
ily deep in the darkened sky. The 
roadway, almost unoccupied, 
wound its way along the ridge. 
Far below gleamed the far- 
spreading campus lights. The 
wind, blowing up the ridge, car- 
ried the faint smell of burning 
leaves. 

“The fire was nice,” said Carol. 
“Why is it, Peter, that we don’t 
have fires? It would be so simple. 
A fireplace wouldn’t be so hard 
to build.” 

“There was a time, several 
hundred years ago,” said Max- 
well, “when every house, or al- 

46 



most every house, had at least 
one fireplace. Sometimes several. 
The whole thing of having fires 
was a throwback, of course. Back 
to the days when fire was a pro- 
tection and a warmth. But final- 
ly we outgrew it.” 

( L T don’t think we did,” she 
-*• said. “We just walked away, 
is all. Turned our back upon this 
one segment of our past. We still 
have need of fire. A psychological 
need, perhaps. I found that out 
tonight. It was so exciting and so 
comfortable. Primal, maybe, but 
there still must be some of the 
primal in us.” 

“Oop,” he told her, “couldn’t 
live without a fire. The lack of a 
fire was the thing that bugged 
him most when Time brought 
him back. He had to be held cap- 
tive for a time, of course, when 
he first was brought here — close- 
ly watched over if not actually 
confined. But when he became 
his own master, so to speak, he 
got hold of a piece of land out at 
the edge of the campus and built 
himself the shack. Rough, the 
way he wanted it. And, of course, 
a fireplace. And a garden. You 
should see his garden. The idea 
of growing food was something 
new to him. Something that no 
one back in his day had ever 
thought about. Nails and saws 
and hammers, and even lumber, 
also were new to him, as was 

GALAXY 



everything. But he was highly 
adaptable. He took to the new 
tools and ideas without a single 
hitch. Nothing astonished him. 
He used hammer and saw and 
lumber and all the rest of it 
to build the shack. But I think 
it was the garden that seemed 
the most wonderful to him — to 
grow one’s food and not hunt for 
it. I suppose you noticed — even 
now he is impressed with the 
sheer bulk and the easy availa- 
bility of food.” 

“And of liquor,” said Carol. 
Maxwell laughed. “Another 
new idea that he took to. A hob- 
by of his, you might almost say. 
He makes his own. He’s got a 
still out in the back of his wood- 
shed, and he runs off some of 
the worst moonshine that ever 
trickled down your throat. Pretty 
vile stuff.” 

“But not to guests,” said Carol. 
“That was whiskey tonight.” 
“You have to be a friend of 
his,” said Maxwell, “before he’ll 
allow you to drink his moon. 
Those fruit jars he set out . ” 
“I wondered about those. They 
seemed to have nothing in them.” 
“Clear, rotgut moonshine, that 
was what was in them.” 

“You said he was a captive 
once. And now? Just how closely 
is he tied to Time?” 

“A ward of the college. Not 
really tied at all. But you couldn’t 
drive him off. He’s a more loyal 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



partisan of Time than you are.” 
“And Ghost? He lives here at 
Supernatural? He’s a ward of 
Supernatural?” 

“Hardly. Ghost is a stray cat 
He goes anywhere he wishes. He’s 
got friends all over the planet. 
He’s big stuff, I understand, at 
the College of Comparative Re- 
ligions on the Himalayan Cam- 
pus. But he manages to drop in 
here on a fairly regular basis. He 
and Oop hit it off from the mo- 
ment Supernatural made its first 
contact with Ghost.” 

“Pete, you call hirfi Ghost. 
What is he, really?” 

“Why, he is a ghost.” 

“But what’s a ghost?” 

“I don’t know. I don’t think 
anybody does.” 

“But you’re with Supernatu- 
ral.” 

“Oh, sure, but all my work has 
been with the Little Folk, with 
emphasis on goblins, although I 
have an interest in every one of 
them. Even banshees, and there’s 
nothing that comes meaner or 
more unreasonable than a ban- 
shee.” 

“There must be specialists in 
ghosts, then. What do they have 
to say about it?” 

“I guess they have a few ideas. 
There are tons of literature on 
spookery, but I’ve never had the 
time to go into it. I know that 
back in the early ages it was be- 
lieved that everyone, when they 

47 



died, turned into a ghost, but 
now, I understand, that no longer 
is believed. There are certain 
special circumstances that give 
rise to ghosts, but I don’t know 
what they are.” 

“That face of his,” said Carol. 
“A little spooky, maybe, but 
somehow fascinating. I had a 
hard time to keep from staring 
at him. Just a dark blankness 
folded inside his sheet which, I 
suppose, is not a sheet. And at 
times a hint of eyes. Little lights 
that could be eyes. Or was I 
imagining?” 

“No. I’ve imagined them my- 
self.” 

“Will you,” asked Carol, “grab 
hold of that fool oat and pull 
him in a foot or so. He’s slipping 
out onto the faster belt. He has 
no sense whatever. He’ll go to 
sleep any time, at any place. Eat 
and sleep is all he thinks about.” 

A X axwell reached down and 
tugged Sylvester back into 
his original position. Sylvester 
growled and mumbled in his 
sleep. 

Maxwell straightened and 
leaned back into his chair, look- 
ing up into the sky. 

“Look at the stars,” he said. 
“There is nothing like the skies 
of Earth. I’m glad to be back 
again.” 

“And now that you’re back?” 

“After I see you safely home 



and pick up my luggage, I’m go- 
ing back to Oop’s. He’ll have one 
of those fruit jars all unscrewed 
and we’ll do some drinking and 
sit and talk till dawn, then I’ll get 
into the bed he has for guests, 
and he’ll curl up on his pile of 
leaves . .” 

“I saw those leaves over in the 
comer and was consumed with 
curiosity. But I didn’t ask.” 

“He sleeps there all the time. 
Not comfortable in a bed. After 
all, when for .many years a pile 
of leaves has been the height of 
luxury — ” 

“You’re trying to make a fool 
of me again.” 

“No, I’m not,” said Maxwell. 
“I’m telling you the truth.” 

“I didn’t mean what will you 
do tonight. I mean what will you 
do? You are dead, remember?” 
“I’ll explain,” said Maxwell. 
“I’ll continually explain. Every- 
where I go there’ll be people 
who’ll want to know what hap- 
pened. There might even be an 
investigation of some sort. I sin- 
cerely hope there won’t, but I 
suppose there may have to be.” 
“I’m sorry,” Carol said, “but, 
then, I’m also glad. How fortun- 
ate that there were two of you.” 
“If Transport could work it 
out,” said Maxwell, “they might 
have something they could sell. 
All of us could keep a second one 
of us stashed away somewhere 
against emergency.”

“But it wouldn’t work,” Carol 
pointed out. “Not personally. 
This other Peter Maxwell was a 
second person and — oh, I don’t 
know. It’s too late at night to 
get it figured out. But I’m sure it 
wouldn’t work.” 

“No,” said Maxwell. “No, I 
guess it wouldn’t. It was a bad 
idea.” 

“It was a nice evening,” said 
Carol. “I thank you so much for 
it. I had a lot of fun.” 

“And Sylvester had a lot of 
steak.” 

“Yes, he did. He’ll not forget 
you. He loves folks who give him 
steak. He’s nothing but a glut- 
ton.” 

“There is just one thing,” said 
Maxwell. “One thing you didn’t 
tell us. Who was it that made 
the offer for the Artifact?” 

“I don’t know. Just that there 
was an offer. Good enough, I 
gather, for Time to consider it. 
I simply overheard a snatch of 
conversation I was not supposed 
to hear. Does it make a differ- 
ence?” 

“It could,” said Maxwell. 

“I remember now,” she said. 
“There was another name. Not 
the one who meant to buy it, or 
I don’t think it was. Just some- 
one who was involved. It had 
slipped my mind till now. Some- 
one by the name of Churchill. 
Does that mean anything to 
you?” 

GOBLIN RESERVATION 



/'"'vop was sitting in front of the 
fireplace, paring his toenails 
with a large jackknife, when 
Maxwell returned, carrying his 
bag. 

Oop gestured with the knife 
toward the bed. “Sling it over 
there and then come and sit down 
with me. I’ve just put a couple 
of new logs on the fire and I have 
a jug half finished and a couple 
more hid out.” 

“Where’s Ghost?” asked Max- 
well. 

“Oh, he disappeared. I don’t 
know where he went; he never 
tells me. But he’ll be back again. 
He never is gone long.” 

Maxwell put the bag on the 
bed, went over to the fireplace 
and sat down, leaning against its 
rough stone face. 

“You played the clown to- 
night,” he said, “somewhat better 
than you usually manage. What 
was the big idea?” 

“Those big eyes of hers,” said 
Oop, grinning. “And just begging 
to be shocked. I am sorry, Pete. 
I simply couldn’t help it.” 

“All that talk about cannibal- 
ism and vomiting,” said Maxwell. 
“That was pretty God damned 
low.” 

“Well,” said Oop, “I guess I 
just got carried away. That’s the 
way folks expect a crummy Ne- 
anderthal to act.” 

49 



“The girl’s no fool,” said Max- 
well. “She planted that story 
about the Artifact as neatly as I 
have ever seen it done.” 

“Planted it?” 

“Sure, planted it. You don’t 
think it just slipped out, do you, 
the way she pretended that it 
did?” 

“I hadn’t thought of that,” said 
Oop. “Maybe she did. But if she 
did, why do you think she did it?” 

“I would guess she doesn’t want 
it sold. Figured that if she told 
it to a blabbermouth like you it 
would be all over the campus be- 
fore noon tomorrow. A lot of talk 
about it, She might figure, would 
help to kill the deal.” 

“But you know, Pete, that I’m 
no blabbermouth.” 

“I know it. But you acted like 
one tonight.” 

Oop closed the jackknife and 
slid it in his pocket, picked up the 
half-empty fruit jar and handed 
it to Maxwell. Maxwell put it to 
his mouth and drank. The fiery 
liquid slashed like a knife along 
his throat, and he choked. He 
wished, he thought, that for once 
he could drink the stuff without 
choking on it. He took it down 
and sat there, gasping for breath. 

“Potent stuff,” said Oop. “Best 
batch I’ve run off for quite a 
while. Did you see the bead on 
it?” 

Maxwell, unable to speak, 
nodded. 

50 



Oop reached out and took the 
jar, tilted it up, lowered its level 
by an inch or more. He took it 
down and held it lovingly against 
his hairy chest. He let out his 
breath in a whoosh that made 
the flames in the fireplace dance. 
He patted the bottle with his free 
hand. 

“First rate stuff,” he said. 

He wiped his mouth with the 
the back of his hand and sat, 
staring at the fire. 

CtQhe couldn’t, certainly, have 
taken you for a blabber- 
mouth,” he finally said. “I notice 
that you did some fancy skating 
of your own tonight. All around 
the truth.” 

“Maybe because I don’t entire- 
ly know the truth myself,” said 
Maxwell. “Or what to do about 
it. You set to do some listening?” 
“Any time,” said Oop. “If that 
is what you want. Although you 
don’t need to tell me. Not out 
of friendship. You know we’ll still 
be friends if you tell me nothing. 
We don’t even need to talk about 
it. There are a lot of other things 
we could talk about.” 

Maxwell shook his head. “I 
have to tell you, Oop. I have to 
tell someone, and you’re the only 
one I would dare to tell. There’s 
too much of it for me to go on 
carrying it alone.” 

Oop handed him the fruit jar. 
“Take another slug of that, then 

GALAXY 



start any time you want. What 
I can’t figure out is the goof by 
Transport. I don’t believe it hap- 
pened. I would make a guess that 
it was something else.” 

“And you’d be right,” said 
Maxwell. There’s a planet out 
there somewhere. Fairly close, I’d 
guess. A free-wheeling planet, not 
tied to any sun, although I gather 
that it could insert itself into a 
solar system any time it wishes.” 

“That would take some doing. 
It would mess up the orbits of 
all the other planets.” 

“Not necessarily,” said Max- 
well. “It wouldn’t have to take 
an orbit in the same plane as 
the other planets. That would 
hold down the effect of its being 
there.” 

He lifted the fruit jar, shut 
his eyes, and took a healthy gulp. 
The top of his head came off, and 
his stomach bounced. He lowered 
the jar and leaned back against 
the roughness of the masonry. 
A wind was mewing in the chim- 
ney — a lonely sound, shut out- 
side by the rough board walls. 
A log fell in the fireplace and sent 
up a shower of sparks. The flames 
danced high, and flickering sha- 
dows chased one another all 
about the room. 

Oop reached out and took the 
jar out of Maxwell’s hands, but 
did not drink immediately. He 
held it cuddled in his lap. 

“So this other planet reached 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



out and copied your wave pat- 
tern,” he said, “and there were 
two of you.” 

“How did you know that?” 
“Deduction. It was the most 
logical way for it to happen. I 
know there were two of you. 
There was this other one who 
came back before you did. I 
talked with him, and he was you. 
He said there was no dragon; the 
Coonskin business had been a 
wild goose chase and so he came 
home ahead of his schedule.” 
“So that was it,” said Maxwell. 
“I had wondered why he came 
back early.” 

“I’m hard put to it,” said Oop, 
“to decide if I should rejoice or 
mourn. Perhaps a bit of both, 
leaving some room for wonder- 
ment at the strange workings of 
human destiny. This other man 
was you, and now he’s dead and 
I have lost a friend. For he was 
a human being and a personality, 
and that humanity and personali- 
ty came to an end with death. 
But now there’s you. And if, be- 
fore, I’d lost a friend, now I have 
regained that lost friend, for you 
are as truly Peter Maxwell as 
that other one.” 

“I was told an accident.” 

tCT’m not so sure,” said Oop. 

“I’ve been doing some 
thinking about it. Since you came 
back, I’m not so sure at all. He 
was getting off a roadway and he 

51 



tripped and fell, hit his head 

l> 

“You don’t trip when you’re 
getting off a roadway. Unless 
you’re drunk or crippled up or 
awkward. That outside belt is 
barely crawling.” 

“I know,” said Oop. “That’s 
what the police thought, too. But 
there was no other explanation, 
and the police, as you well know, 
require some sort of explanation, 
so they can close the file. It was 
in a lonely place. About halfway 
between here and Goblin Reser- 
vation. No one saw it. Must have 
happened when there was almost 
no one traveling, maybe at night. 
He was found about ten o’clock 
in the morning. There would 
have been people traveling from 
six o’clock on, but probably 
they’d have been on the inner, 
faster belts. They wouldn’t have 
seen too much on the outside of 
the belt. The body could have 
been lying there for a long time 
before it was found.” 

“You think it wasn’t an acci- 
dent? It may have been murder?” 

“I don’t know. The thought 
has occurred to me. There was 
one funny thing about it — some- 
thing that never was explained. 
There was a funny smell about 
the body and the area. A strange 
sort of odor, like nothing no one 
had ever smelled before. Maybe 
someone found out that there 
were two of you. For some rea- 
52 



son, someone may not have want- 
ed two of you . ” 

“But who could have known 
there were two of me?” 

“The people on that other plan- 
et. If there were people.” 

“There were people,” Maxwell 
said. “It was a most amazing 
place.” 

It all came back as he sat there 
talking, almost as if he were there 
again. A crystal place — or that 
had been what it had looked to 
be when he first had seen it. An 
extensive crystal plain that ran 
on and on and a crystal sky with 
pillars reaching from the plain 
and upward, apparently to the 
sky, although the tops of them 
were lost in the milkiness of sky 
— pillars soaring upward to hold 
the sky in place. An empty place, 
to make one think of a deserted 
ballroom of extensive size, all 
cleaned and polished for a ball, 
waiting for the music and the 
dancers who had never come and 
now would never come, leaving 
the ballroom empty through all 
eternity, shining in all its polished 
glitter and its wasted gracious- 
ness. 

A ballroom, but a ballroom 
without any walls, running on 
and on, not to a horizon, for there 
seemed to be no horizon, but to 
a point where that strange, milk- 
glass sky came down to meet the 
crystal floor. 

He stood astounded in the vast 

GALAXY 



immensity, an immensity not of 
boundless sky, for the sky was 
far from boundless, nor from 
great distances, for the distances 
were not great, but immensity 
that was measured as a room 
would be, as if one were in a 
giant’s house and lost and were 
looking for a door, and without 
a clue as to where a door might 
be. A place with no distinguish- 
ing features, with each pillar like 
the next, with no cloud in the sky 
(if it were a sky), with each foot, 
each mile like every other foot 
and mile, level and paved with a 
crystal paving that stretched out 
in all directions. 

He wanted to cry out, to ask 
if anyone were there, but was 
afraid to cry out — perhaps in 
the fear, although he did not rea- 
lize it then and only thought it 
later, that a single sound would 
send all this cold and shining 
splendor shimmering into a cloud 
of frosty dust. For the place was 
silent, with no slightest whisper 
of a sound. Silent and cold and 
lonely, all its splendor and its 
whiteness lost in the loneliness. 

Slowly, carefully, fearing that 
the scuff of his moving feet might 
bring this whole world into dust, 
he pivoted, and out of the corner 
of his eye he caught a glimpse — 
not of motion, but the flickering 
sense of motion, as if something 
had been there, but had moved 
so fast that his eyes had failed 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



to catch it. He halted, the short 
hairs prickling on the back of his 
neck, engulfed by the sense of 
utter strangeness rather than of 
actual danger, apprehensive of a 
strangeness so distorted and so 
twisted out of the normal human 
context that a man gazing at it 
might go mad before he had a 
chance to jerk his eyes away. 

Nothing happened. 

He moved again, pivoting inch 
by cautious inch, and now he saw 
that he had been standing with 
his back turned on what appeared 
to be an assemblage of some sort 
— an engine? An instrument? A 
machine? 

\ nd all at once he knew. Here 
was the strange contraption 
that had brought him here, this 
crazy crystal world’s equivalent 
of matter transmitter and re- 
ceiver. 

But this, he knew at once, was 
not the Coonskin system. It was 
no place he had ever heard of. 

Nowhere in the known universe 
was there a place like this. Some- 
thing had gone wrong. He had 
been hurled, not to the Coon- 
skin planet which had been his 
destination, but to some far, for- 
gotten comer of the universe, to 
some area, perhaps, where man 
would not penetrate for another 
million years, so far away from 
EartK that the distances involved 
became unimaginable. 

53 



Now again there were flicker- 
ing motions, as if living shadows 
moved against the crystal back- 
ground. As he watched, the flick- 
ering flowed into shifting shape 
and form, and he could see that 
there were many moving shapes, 
all of them, strangely, separate 
entities that seemed to hold, with- 
in the flicker of them, individual 
personalities. As if, he thought 
in horror, they were things that 
had once been people. As if they 
might be alien ghosts. 

“And I accepted them,” he said 
to Oop. “I accepted them — on 
faith, perhaps. It was either that, 
or reject them and be left there, 
standing all alone upon that crys- 
tal plain. A man of a century ago, 
perhaps, would not have accepted 
them. He would have been inclin- 
ed to sweep them out of his mind 
as pure imagination. But I had 
spent too many hours with Ghost 
to 'gag at the thought of ghosts. 
I had worked too long with su- 
pernatural phenomena to quibble 
at the idea of creatures and of 
events beyond the human pale. 

“And the strange thing about 
it, the comforting thing about it, 
is that they sensed that I accept- 
ed them.” 

“And that is it?” asked Oop. 
“A planet full of ghosts?” 

Maxwell nodded, “Perhaps 
that’s one way of looking at it. 
But let me ask you — what real- 
ly is a ghost?” 

54 



“A spook,” said Oop. “A spir- 
it.” 

“I know,” said Oop, regretfully. 
“I was being a bit facetious, and 
there was no excuse for it. We 
don’t know what a ghost is. Even 
Ghost doesn’t know exactly what 
he is. He simply knows that he 
exists — and if anyone should 
know, he should. He has mulled 
over it a lot. He’s thought about 
it deeply. He has communed with 
fellow ghosts, and there is no evi- 
dence. So you fall back upon the 
supernatural — ” 

“Which is not understood,” 
said Maxwell. 

“A mutation of some sort,” 
suggested Oop. 

“Collins thought so,” said Max- 
well. “But he stood alone. I know 
I didn’t agree with him, but that 
was before I was on the crystal 
planet. Now I’m not so sure. 
What happens when a race 
reaches an end, when, as a race, 
it has passed through childhood 
and middle age and now has 
reached old age? A race dying 
as a man does, dying of old age. 
What does it do, then? It could 
die, of course. That’s what one 
would expect of it. But suppose 
there was a reason that it couldn’t 
die, suppose it had to hang on, 
had to stay alive for some over- 
riding reason, that it could not 
allow itself to die?” 

“If ghostliness really is a mu- 
tation,” said Oop, “if they knew 

GALAXY 



it was a mutation, if they were 
so far advanced they could con- 
trol mutation . ” 

He stopped and looked at 
Maxwell. “You think that’s what 
might have happened?” 

“I think it might,” said Max- 
well. “I am beginning to think 
very much it might.” 

Oop handed across the fruit 
jar. “You need a drink,” he said. 
“And when you’re through with 
it, I’ll have one myself.” 

X 

A /Taxwell took the jar, holding 
it, not drinking right away. 
Oop reached out to the stack of 
wood, lifted a chunk in one mas- 
sive fist and threw it on the fire. 
A spray of sparks gushed up the 
chimney. Outside the night wind 
moaned along the eaves. 

Maxwell lifted the jar and 
drank. He choked, wishing that 
he could drink the stuff, just 
once, without choking on it. He 
handed the jar back to Oop. Oop 
lifted it, then took it down again 
without drinking. He squinted 
across its rim at Maxwell. 

“You said something to live 
for. Some reason that they 
couldn’t die — that they had to 
keep on existing, any way they 
could.” 

“That’s right,” said Maxwell. 
“Information. Knowledge. A 
planet crammed with knowledge. 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



A storehouse of knowledge — and 
I would doubt that a tenth of it 
duplicates our own. The rest of 
it is new, unknown. Some of it 
material we have never dreamed 
of. Knowledge that we may not 
ferret out short of a million years, 
if we ever ferret it. It is stored 
electronically, I suppose — ar- 
ranging atoms in such a manner 
that each atom carries a bit of 
information. Stored in metal 
sheets, like the pages of a book, 
stacked in great heaps and piles, 
and each layer of atoms — yes, 
they are arranged in layers — 
carries separate information. You 
read the first layer and then go 
down to the second layer. Again, 
like pages in a book, each layer 
of atoms a page, one stacked atop 
the other. Each sheet of metal — 
don’t ask me, I can’t even guess, 
how many layers of atoms in each 
metal sheet. Hundreds of thou- 
sands, I would suspect.” 

Oop lifted the jar hastily, took 
a tremendous gulp, part of the 
liquor spraying out across his 
woolly chest. He let out his 
breath in a lusty belch. 

“They can’t abandon this 
knowledge,” said Maxwell. “They 
have to pass it on to someone who 
can use it. They have to stay 
alive, somehow, until they pass 
it on. And that, for the love of 
God, is where I come in. They 
commissioned me to sell it for 
them.” 

55 



“Sell it for them! A bunch of 
ghosts, hanging on by their very 
toenails! What would they want? 
What’s the price they ask?” 
Maxwell put up his hand and 
wiped his forehead, which had 
sprouted a sudden mist of sweat. 
“I don’t know,” 'he said. 

“Don’t know? How can you 
sell a thing if you don’t know 
what it’s worth, if you don’t have 
an asking price?” 

“They said they would tell me 
later. They said to get someone 
interested and they’d get word 
to me on what the price would 
be.” 

Ctnphat,” said Oop, disgusted, 
“is a hell of a way to 
make a business deal.” 

“Yes, I know,” said Maxwell. 
“You have no hint of price?” 
“Not the faintest. I tried to ex- 
plain to them, and they couldn’t 
understand. Maybe they refused 
to understand. And since then I 
have gone over it and over it and 
there’s no way I can know. It all 
boils down, of course, to what a 
gang like that might want. And 
for the life of me, I can’t think 
of a thing they’d want” 

“Well,” said Oop, “they picked 
the right place to make their sales 
pitch.. How do you plan to go 
about it?” 

“I’ll go up and talk to Arnold.” 
“You pick them tough,” said 
Oop. 

56 



“Look, I have to talk with 
Arnold and no one else. This 
can’t go up through channels. 
Can’t have a word of it leak out. 
On the surface, it sounds hare- 
brained. If the communications 
media or the gossip-mongers got 
hold of it, the University wouldn’t 
dare to touch it. If it were known 
and they did consider it and the 
deal fell through — and, believe 
me, working in the dark, as I 
have to work, the deal could well 
fall through — there’d be just 
one loud guffaw all the way from 
here clear out to the Rim. It 
would be Arnold’s neck and my 
neck.” 

“Pete, Arnold is nothing but a 
big stuffed shirt. You know that 
as well as I do. He’s an adminis- 
trator. He’s running the business 
end of this University. I don’t 
care if he has the title of presi- 
dent or not, he’s just the man- 
ager. He doesn’t give a damn 
about the academic end of it. He 
won’t stick out his neck for three 
planets full of knowledge.” 

“The president of the universi- 
ty has to be an administrator . .” 

“If it could have come at any 
other time,” mourned Oop, “you 
might have had a chance. But as 
it stands right now, Arnold is 
walking on a crate of eggs. Mov- 
ing the administration from New 
York to this jerkwater campus.” 

“A campus,” put in Maxwell, 
“with a great liberal tradition.” 

GALAXY 



“University politics,” declared 
Oop, “doesn’t care about liberal 
traditions or any other kind of 
traditions.” 

“I suppose not,” said Maxwell, 
“but Arnold’s the man I have to 
see. I could wish it were someone 
else. I have no admiration for the 
man, but he’s the one I have to 
work with.” 

“You could have turned it 
down.” 

“The job of negotiator? No, I 
couldn’t, Oop. No man could 
have. They’d have had to find 
someone else and they might get 
someone who’d bungle it. Not 
that I’m sure I won’t bungle it. 
But at least I’ll try. And it’s not 
only for us, it’s for them I’m try- 
ing as well.” 

“You got to like these people?” 

“I’m not sure just how much 
I liked them. Admired them, 
maybe. Felt sorry for them, may- 
be. They’re doing what they can. 
They hunted for so long to find 
somone they could pass the 
knowledge on to.” 

“Pass it on? You said it was 
for sale.” 

“Only because there is some- 
thing that they want. Or need. 
I wish I could figure out what it 
is. It would make everything 
so much easier for everyone con- 
cerned.” 

“Minor question — you talked 
with them. How did you go about 
it?” 

GOBLIN RESERVATION 



tC'T'he tablets,” said Maxwell. 

“I told you about the tab- 
lets. The sheets of metal that 
carried information. They talked 
with me with tablets, and I talked 
with them the same way.” 

“But how could you read — ” 
“They gave me a contraption, 
like a pair of goggles, but big. 
It was a sort of bulky thing. I 
suppose it had a lot of mechan- 
ism in it. I’d put it on and then 
I could read the tablets. No 
script, just little jiggles in the 
metal. It’s hard to explain. But 
you looked at the jiggles through 
the contraption that you wore 
and you knew what the jiggles 
said. It was adjustable, I found 
out later, so you could read the 
different atomic layers. But to 
start with, they only wrote me 
messages, if wrote is the word to 
use. Like kids writing back and 
forth to one another on slates. I 
wrote back to them by thinking 
into another contraption that was 
tied into the pair of goggles that 
I wore.” 

“A translator,” said Oop. 

“I suppose that’s what it was. 
A two-way translator.” 

“We’ve tried to work one out,” 
said Oop. “By ‘we’ I mean the 
combined ingenuity not only of 
the Earth, but of what we laugh- 
ingly call the known galaxy.” 
“Yes, I know,” said Maxwell. 
“And these folks had one. 
These ghosts of yours.” 

57 



“They have a whole lot more,” 
said Maxwell. “I don’t know 
what they have. I sampled some 
of what they had. At random. 
Just enough to convince myself 
they had what they said.” 

“One thing still bugs me,” said 
Oop. “You said a planet. What 
about a star.” 

“The planet is roofed over. 
There was a star, I gather, but 
you couldn’t see it, not from the 
surface. The point is, of course, 
that there needn’t be a star. You 
are acquainted, I think, with the 
concept of the oscillating uni- 
verse.” 

“The yo-yo universe,” said 
Oop. “The one that goes bang, 
and then bang, bang again.” 

C tnphat’s right,” said Maxwell. 

“And now we can quit 
wondering about it. It happens 
to be true. The crystal planet 
comes from the universe that ex- 
isted before the present universe 
was formed. They had it figured 
out, you see. They knew the time 
would come when all the energy 
would be gone and all the dead 
matter would start moving slowly 
back to form another cosmic egg, 
so that the egg could explode 
again and give birth to yet an- 
other universe. They knew they 
were approaching the death of 
the universe and that unless 
something were done, it would be 
death for them as well. So they 
58 



launched a project. A planetary 
project. They sucked in energy 
and stored it — don’t ask me 
how they extracted it from where- 
ever they extracted it or how 
they stored it. Stored somehow in 
the very material of the planet, 
so that when the rest of the uni- 
verse went black and dead, they 
still had energy. They roofed the 
planet in, they made a house of 
it. They worked out propulsion 
mechanisms so they could move 
their planet, so that they would 
be an independent body moving 
independently through space. 
And before the inward drifting 
of the dead matter of the uni- 
verse began, they left their star, 
a dead and blackened cinder by 
this time, and set out on their 
own. That’s the way they have 
been since then, a holdover pop- 
ulation riding on a planetary 
spaceship. They saw the old uni- 
verse die, the one before this one. 
They were left alone in space, 
in space that had no hint of life, 
no glint of light no quiver of en- 
ergy. It may be — I don’t know 
— that they saw the formation 
of the brand new cosmic egg. 
They could have been very far 
from it and seen it. And if they 
saw it, they saw the explosion 
that marked the beginning of this 
universe we live in, the blinding 
flash, far off, that sent the ener- 
gy streaking into space. They saw 
the first stars glow red; they saw 

GALAXY 



the galaxies take shape. And 
When the galaxies had formed, 
they joined this new universe. 
•They could go to any galaxy 
they chose, set up an orbit about 
any star they wished. They could 
move any time they wanted to. 
They were universal gypsies. But 
the end is nearing now. The plan- 
et, I suppose, could keep on and 
on, for the energy machinery 
must still be operative. I imagine 
there might be a limit to the plan- 
et, but they’re not even close to 
that. But the race is dying out, 
and they have stored in their 
records the knowledge of two 
universes.” 

“Fifty billion years,” said Oop. 
“Fifty billion years of learning.” 

“At least that much,” said 
Maxwell. “It could be a great 
deal more.” 

They sat, silent, thinking of 
those fifty billion years. The fire 
mumbled in the chimney’s throat. 
From far off came the chiming 
of the clock in Music Hall, count- 
ing off the time. 

XI 

A /T axwell awoke. Oop was shak- 
ing him. “Someone here to 
see you.” 

Maxwell threw back the cov- 
ers, hoisted his feet out on the 
floor, groped blindly for his 
trousers. Oop handed them to 
him. 

GOBLIN RESERVATION 



“Who is it?” he asked Oop. 
“Said his name was Longfellow. 
Nasty, high-nosed gent. He’s 
waiting outside for you. You 
could see he wouldn’t risk con- 
tamination by stepping in the 
shack.” 

“Then to hell with him,” said 
Maxwell, starting to crawl back 
into bed. 

“No, no,” protested Oop. “I 
don’t mind. I’m above insult.” 
Maxwell struggled into his 
trousers, slid his feet into his 
shoes and kicked them on. 

“Any idea who this fellow is?” 
“None at all,” said Oop. 
Maxwell stumbled across the 
room to the bench set against the 
wall, spilled water from the buck- 
et standing there into a wash 
basin, bent and sloshed water on 
his face. 

“What time is it?” he asked. 

“A little after seven.” 

“Mr. Longfellow must have 
been in a hurry to see me.” 

“He’s out there now, pacing 
up and down. Impatient.” 
Longfellow was impatient. 

As Maxwell came out of the 
door, he hurried up to him and 
held out a hand. 

“Professor Maxwell,” he said, 
“I’m so glad I found you. It was 
quite a job. Someone told me you 
might be here — ” he glanced at 
the shack, and his long nose crin- 
kled just a trifle — “so I took 
the chance/’ 

59 



“Oop,” said Maxwell quietly, 
“is an old and valued friend.” 
“Could we perhaps take a 
stroll?” suggested Longfellow. “It 
is an unusually fine morning. 
Have you breakfasted yet? No, 
I don’t suppose you have.” 

“It might help,” said Maxwell, 
“if you told me who you are.” 
“I’m in administration. Stephen 
Longfellow is the name. Appoint- 
ments secretary to the president.” 
“Then you’re just the man I 
want to see,” said Maxwell. “I 
need an appointment with the 
president as soon as possible.” 
Longfellow shook his head. “I 
would say offhand that is quite 
impossible.” 

nphey fell into step and walked 
along the path that led down 
toward the roadway. Leaves of 
wondrous, shining yellow fell 
slowly through the air from a 
thick-branched walnut tree that 
stood beside the path. Down by 
the roadway a maple tree was a 
blaze of scarlet against the blue- 
ness of the morning sky. And far 
in that sky streamed a V-shaped 
flock of ducks heading south- 
ward. 

“Impossible,” said Maxwell. 
“You make it sound final. As if 
you’d thought about it and come 
to your decision.” 

“If you wish to communicate 
with Dr. Arnold,” Longfellow 
told him coldly, “there are proper 
60 



channels. You must understand 
the president is a busy man.” 

“I understand all that,” said 
Maxwell, “and I understand as 
well about the channels. Innum- 
erable delays, a request passed on 
from hand to hand and the 
knowledge of one’s communica- 
tion spread among so many peo- 
ple — ” 

“Professor Maxwell,” Longfel- 
low said, “there is no use, it 
seems, to beat about the bush. 
You’re a persistent man and, I 
suspect, a rather stubborn one, 
and with a man of that bent it 
is often best to lay it on the line. 
The president won’t see you. He 
can’t afford to see you.” 

“Because there seems to have 
been two of me? Because one of 
me is dead?” 

“The press will be full of it 
this morning. All the headlines 
shouting about a man come back 
from the dead. Have you heard 
the radio, perhaps, or watched 
television?” 

“No,” Maxwell said, “I 
haven’t.” 

“Well, when you get around to 
it you’ll find that you’ve been 
made a three-ring circus. I don’t 
mind telling you that it is em- 
barrassing.” 

“You mean a scandal?” 

“I suppose you could call it 
that. And administration has 
trouble enough without identify- 
ing itself with a situation such as 

GALAXY 



yours. There is this matter of 
Shakespeare, for example. We 
can’t duck that one, but we can 
duck you.” • 

“But surely,” said Maxwell, 
“administration can’t be too con- 
cerned with Shakespeare and my- 
self as compared to all the other 
problems that it faces. There is 
the uproar over the revival of 
dueling at Heidelberg and the 
dispute over the ethics of em- 
ploying certain alien students on 
the football squads and — ” 

“But can’t you see,” wailed 
Longfellow, “that what happens 
on this particular campus are the 
things that matter?” 

“Because administration was 
transferred here? When Oxford 
and California and Harvard and 
half a dozen others — ” 

“If you ask me,” Longfellow 
declared, stiffly, “it was a piece 
of poor judgment on the part 
of the board of regents. It has 
made things very difficult for 
administration.” 

“What would happen,” asked 
Maxwell, “if I just walked up the 
hill and into administration and 
started pounding desks?” 

“You know well enough. You’d 
be thrown out.” 

“But if I brought along a corps 
of the newspaper and television 
boys and they were outside 
watching?” 

“I suppose then you wouldn’t 
be thrown out. You might even 

GOBLIN RESERVATION 



get to see the president. But I 
can assure you that under cir- 
cumstances such as those you’d 
not get whatever it may be yeu 
want,” 

“So,” said Maxwell, “I’d lose, 
no matter how I went about it.” 
“As a matter of fact,” Longfel- 
low told him, “I had come this 
morning on quite a different mis- 
sion. I was bringing happy news.” 
“I can imagine that you were,” 
said Maxwell. “What kind of sop 
are you prepared to throw me to 
make me disappear?” 

“Not a sop,” said Longfellow, 
much aggrieved. “I was told to 
offer you the post of dean at the 
experimental college the universi- 
ty is establishing out on Gothic 
IV.” 

“You mean that planet with 
all the witches and the war- 
locks?” 

“It would be a splendid oppor- 
tunity for a man in your field,” 
Longfellow insisted. “A planet 
where wizardry developed with- 
out the intervention of other in- 
telligences, as is the case on 
Earth.” 

“A hundred and fifty light- 
years distant,” said Maxwell. 
“Somewhat remote and I would 
think it might be dreary. But I 
suppose the salary’d be good.” 
“Very good, indeed.” 

“No, thanks,” said Maxwell. 
I’m satisfied with my job, right 
here.” 

61 



“What job?” asked Longfellow. 

“Why, yes. I’m on the faculty.” 

Longfellow shook his head. 
“Not any longer,” he said. “Have 
you, by any chance, forgotten? 
You died more than three weeks 
ago. We can’t let vacancies go 
unfilled.” 

“You mean I’ve been replac- 
ed?” 

“Why, most certainly,” Long- 
fellow told him, nastily. “As it 
stands right now, you are unem- 
ployed.” 

XII 

Mphe waiter brought the scram- 
bled eggs and bacon, poured 
the coffee, then went away and 
left Maxwell at the table. 
Through the wide expanse of 
window, Lake Mendota stretched 
away, a sheet of glassy blue, with 
the faint suggestion of purple 
hills on the other shore. A squir- 
rel ran down the bole of the 
gnarled oak tree that stood just 
outside the window and halted, 
head downward, to stare with 
beady eyes at the man sitting at 
the table. A brown and red oak 
leaf planed down deliberately, 
from branch to ground, wobbling 
in the tiny thermal currents of 
air. On the rocky shore a boy and 
girl walked slowly, hand in hand, 
through the lakeshore’s morning 
hush. 

It would have been civilized 

62 



and gracious, Maxwell told him- 
self, to have accepted Longfel- 
low’s invitation to eat breakfast 
with him. But he had had all that 
he could take of the appoint- 
ments secretary. All he wanted 
was to be alone, to gain a little 
time to sort out the situation and 
to do some thinking — although 
probably he could not afford the 
time for thinking. 

Oop had been right. It was ap- 
parent now that to see the uni- 
versity president would be no 
easy task, not only because of 
that official’s busy schedule and 
his staff’s obsession of doing 
things through channels, but be- 
cause for some reason, not entire- 
ly understood, this matter of 
twin Peter Maxwells had assum- 
ed the proportions of a scandal 
from which Arnold had the fer- 
vent wish to be disassociated. 
Maxwell wondered, sitting there 
and gazing out the window at the 
pop-eyed, staring squirrel, wheth- 
er this attitude of the adminis- 
tration might go back to the in- 
terview with Drayton. Had Se- 
curity zeroed in on Arnold? It 
didn’t seem likely. But it was a 
possibility. The depth of Arnold’s 
jittery attitude was emphasized 
by the hurried offer of the post 
on Gothic IV. Not only did ad- 
ministration want nothing to do 
with this second Peter Maxwell, it 
wanted him off the Earth as well, 
buried on a planet where in the 

GALAXY 



space of a little time he would 
be forgotten. 

It was understandable that his 
post at Supernatural had been 
filled after the death of the other 
Peter Maxwell. After all, classes 
must go on. Gaps could not be 
left in the faculty. But even so, 
there were other positions that 
could have been found for him. 
The fact that this had not been 
done, that the Gothic IV position 
had been so quickly offered, was 
evidence enough that he was not 
wanted on the Earth. 

X7'et it all was strange. Admin- 

-*■ istration could not have 
known until sometime yesterday 
that two Peter Maxwells had ex- 
isted. There could not have been 
a problem, there’d have been no 
basis for a problem, until that 
word had been received. Which 
meant, Maxwell told himself, 
that someone had gotten to ad- 
ministration fast — someone who 
wanted to get rid of him, some- 
one who was afraid that he would 
interfere. 

But interfere in what? And the 
answer to that seemed so glib 
and easy that he felt, instinctive- 
ly, that it must be wrong. But 
search as he might, there was one 
answer only — that someone else 
knew of the hoard of knowledge 
on the crystal planet and was 
working to get hold of it. 

There was one name to go on. 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



Carol had said Churchill — that 
Churchill somehow was involved 
in the offer that had been made 
to Time for the Artifact. Was it 
possible that the Artifact was the 
price of the crystal planet’s 
knowledge? One couldn’t count 
on that, of course, although it 
might be so, for no one knew 
what the Artifact might be. 

That Churchill was working on 
the deal was no surprise at all. 
Not for himself, of course, but 
for someone else. For someone 
who could not afford to have his 
identity revealed. It was in deals 
such as this that Churcljill might 
prove useful. The man was a pro- 
fessional fixer and knew his way 
around. He had contacts and 
through long years of operation 
undoubtedly had laid out vari- 
ous pipelines of information into 
many strange and powerful plac- 
es. 

And if such were the case, 
Maxwell’s job became much 
harder. Not only must he guard 
against the rumor-mongering 
that was implicit in administra- 
tion channels, he must now be 
doubly sure that none of his in- 
formation fell into other hands 
where it might be used against 
him. 

The squirrel had gone on down 
the tree trunk and now was busi- 
ly scrounging on the slope of 
lawn that ran down to the lake, 
rustling through the fallen leaves 

63 



in search of an acorn he might 
somehow have missed before. The 
boy and girl had walked out of 
sight and now a hesitant breeze 
was softly rumpling the surface 
of the lake. 

There were only a few others 
at breakfast in the room; most of 
those who had been there when 
Maxwell entered had finished 
now and left. From the floor 
above came the distant murmur- 
ing of voices, the scuffling of feet 
as the daily flow of students be- 
gan to fill the Union, the off- 
hours gathering place of under- 
graduates. 

The Union was one of the old- 
est structures on the campus and 
one of the finest. For over five 
hundred years it had been the 
meeting place, the refuge, the 
study hall of many generations. 
It had settled easily and comfort- 
ably into the functional tradition 
that made it a second home for 
many thousand students. Here 
could be found a quietness for re- 
flection or for study, here the 
cozy corners needed for good talk, 
here the game rooms for billiards 
or for chess, here the eating 
places, here the meeting halls, 
and tucked off in odd corners 
little reading rooms with their 
shelves of books. 

Maxwell pushed back his chair, 
but stayed sitting, finding him- 
self somehow reluctant to get up 
and leave — for once he left this 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



place, he knew, he’d plunge into 
the problems he must face. Out- 
side the window lay a golden 
autumn day, warming as the sun 
rose in the sky — a day for show- 
ers of golden leaves, for blue haze 
on the distant hills, for the solemn 
glory of chrysanthemums bedded 
in the garden, for the quiet glow 
of goldenrod and aster in the 
fields and vacant lots. 

From behind him he heard the 
scurrying of many hard-shod feet 
and when he swung around in his 
chair, he saw the owner of the 
feet advancing rapidly across the 
squared red tiles toward him. 

T t looked like an outsize; land- 

going shrimp, with its jointed 
legs, its strangely canted body 
with long, weird rods — apparent- 
ly sensory organs — extending 
outward from its tiny head. Ms 
color was an unhealthy white and 
its three globular black eyes bob- 
bed on the ends of long antennae. 

It came to a halt beside the 
table. The three antennae swivel- 
ed to aim the three eyes straight 
at Maxwell. 

It said in a high, piping voice, 
the skin of its throat fluttering 
rapidly beneath the seemingly 
inadequate head, “Informed I am 
that you be Professor Peter Max- 
well.” 

“The information happens to 
be right,” said Maxwell. “I am 
Peter Maxwell.” 

65 



“I be a creature out of the 
world you would name Spear- 
head 27. Name I have is of no 
interest to you. I appear before 
you carrying out commission by 
my employer. Perhaps you know 
it by designation of Miss Nancy 
Clayton.” 

“Indeed I do,” said Maxwell, 
thinking that it was very much 
like Nancy Clayton to employ 
an outlandish creature such as 
this as an errand boy. 

“I work myself through educa- 
tion,” explained the Shrimp, “do- 
ing anything I find.” 

“That’s commendable,” said 
Maxwell. 

“I train in mathematics of 
time,” declared the Shrimp. “I 
concentrate on world-line con- 
figurations. I am in tizzy over it.” 
The Shrimp didn’t look as if 
it were in any sort of tizzy. 

“Why all the interest?” Max- 
well asked. “Something in your 
background? Something in your 
cultural heritage?” 

“Oh, very much indeed. Is 
completely new idea. On my 
world, no thought of time, no 
appreciation such a thing as time. 
Am much shocked to learn of it. 
And excited, too. But I digress 
too greatly. I come here on an 
errand. Miss Clayton desires to 
know can you attend a party the 
evening of this day. Her place, 
eight by the clock.” 

“I believe I can,” said Maxwell. 
66 



“Tell her I always make a point 
of being at her parties.” 

“Overjoyed,” said the Shrimp. 
“She so much wants you there. 
You are talked concerning.” 

“I see,” said Maxwell. 

“You hard to find. I run hard , 
and fast. I ask in many places. 
Finally victorious.” 

“I am sorry,” Maxwell said, “I 
put you to such trouble.” 

He reached into his pocket and 
took out a bill. The creature ex- 
tended one of its forward legs 
and grasped the bill in a pair of 
pincers, folded it and refolded it 
and tucked it into a small pouch 
that extruded from its chest. 

“You kind beyond expecta- 
tion,” it piped. “There is one 
further information. Occasion for 
party is unveiling of painting, re- 
cently acquired. Painting lost and 
gone for very long. By Albert 
Lambert, Esquire. Great triumph 
for Miss Clayton.” 

“I just bet it is,” said Maxwell. 
“Miss Clayton is a specialist in 
triumphs.” 

“She, as employer, is gracious,” 
said the Shrimp, reprovingly. 

“I am sure of that,” said Max- 
well. 

The creature shifted swiftly 
and galloped from the room. Lis- 
tening to its departure, Maxwell 
heard it clatter up the stairs to 
the street level of the building. 

Maxwell got up and headed 
for the stairs himself. If he were 

GALAXY 



going to witness the unveiling of 
a painting, he told himself, he’d 
better bone up on the artist. 
Which was exactly, he thought 
with a grin, what almost every 
other person invited to Nancy’s 
party would be doing before the 
day was out. 

Lambert? The name held a 
slight ring of recognition. He had 
read somewhere about him, prob- 
ably long ago. An article in a 
magazine, perhaps, to help pass 
an idle hour. 

XIII 

axwell opened the book. 
“Albert Lambert,” said the 
opening page of text, “was bom 
in Chicago, Illinois, Jan. 11, 1973. 
Famed as a portrayer of grotes- 
que symbolism, his early years 
gave no promise of his great ac- 
complishments. His initial work 
was competent and showed a 
skillful craftsmanship and a deep 
insight into his subject matter, 
but it was not particularly out- 
standing. His grotesque period 
came after his fiftieth year. 
Rather than developing, it burst 
into full flower almost overnight, 
as if the artist had developed it 
secretly and did not show his 
canvasses of this period until he 
was satisfied with this new phase 
of his work. But there is no evi- 
dence that this actually was the 
case. Rather, there seems to be 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



some evidence that it was not” 

Maxwell flipped over the text 
pages to reach the color plates 
and leafed quickly through ex- 
amples of the artist’s early work. 
And there, in the space of one 
page to the next, the paintings 
changed — the artistic concept, 
the color, even, it seemed to Max- 
well, the very craftsmanship. As 
if the work had been that of two 
different artists, the first tied in- 
tellectually to some inner need 
of orderly expression, the second 
engulfed, obsessed, ridden by 
some soul-shaking experience of 
which he tried to cleanse himself 
by spreading it on canvas. 

Stark, dark, terrible beauty 
beat out of the page. In the dusky 
silence of the library reading 
room it seemed to Maxwell that 
he could hear the leathery whis- 
per of black wings. Outrageous 
creatures capered across an out- 
rageous landscape, and yet the 
landscape and the creatures, 
Maxwell sensed at once, were 
not mere fantasy, were no whim- 
sical product of a willful unhing- 
ing of the mind, but seemed to be 
solidly based upon some outre 
geometry predicated upon a logic 
and an outlook alien to anything 
he had ever seen. The form, the 
color, the approach and the atti- 
tude were not merely twisted hu- 
man values. One had the instant 
feeling that they might be, in- 
stead, the prosaic representation 

67 




of a situation in an area entirely 
outside any human value. Gro- 
tesque symbolism, the text had 
said, and it might be there, of 
course. But if so, Maxwell told 
himself, it was symbolism that 
could only be arrived at most 
tortuously after painful study. 

TTe turned the page. There it 
was again, that complete 
divergence from humanity — a 
different scene with different 
creatures against a different land- 
scape, but carrying, as had that 
first plate, the shattering impact 
of actuality, no figment of the 
artist’s mind, but the representa- 
tion of a scene he once had gazed 
upon and sought now to expur- 
gate from mind and memory. As 
a man might wash his hands, 
Maxwell thought, lathering them 
fiercely with a bar of strong, 
harsh soap, scrubbing them again 
and yet again, endlessly, in a des- 
perate attempt to remove by 
physical means a psychic stain 
that he had incurred. A scene 
that he had gazed upon, perhaps, 
not through human eyes, but 
through the alien optics of a lost 
and unguessed race. 

Maxwell sat fascinated, staring 
at the page, wanting to pull his 
eyes away, but unable to. He wa' 
trapped by the weird and awful 
beauty, by some terrible, hidden 
purpose that he could not under- 
stand. Time, the Shrimp had 
68 



said, was something that his race 
had never thought of, a universal 
factor that had not impinged up- 
on his culture. And here, captur- 
ed in these color plates, was 
something that man had never 
thought of, never dreamed of. 

He reached out his hand to 
grasp the book and close it, but 
he hesitated as if there were some 
reason he should not close the 
book, some compelling reason to 
continue staring at the plate. 

And in that hesitancy, he be- 
came aware of a certain strange- 
ness that might keep him staring 
at the page — a puzzling factor 
that he had not recognized con- 
sciously, but that had been nag- 
ging at him. 

He took his hands away and 
sat staring at the plate. Then 
slowly he turned the page. As he 
glanced at that third plate, the 
strangeness leaped out at him — 
a brushed-in flickering, an artis- 
tic technique that made an ap- 
parent flickering, as if some thing 
of substance were there and flick- 
ering, seen one moment, not quite 
seen the next. 

He sat, slack-jawed, and watch- 
ed the flickering. It was a trick 
of the eyes, most likely, encour- 
aged by the mastery of the artist 
over paint and brush. But trick 
of the eye or not, easy of recog- 
nition by anyone who had seen 
the ghostly race of the crystal 
planet. 



GALAXY 



And through the hushed silence 
of the dusky room one question 
hammered at him: How could 
Albert Lambert have known 
about the people of the crystal 
planet? 

CCT had heard about you,” Allen 

-*• Preston said. “It seemed in- 
credible, of course. But the source 
of my information seemed unim- 
peachable, and I made an effort 
to get in touch with you. I’m a bit 
worried over this situation, Pete. 
As an attorney, I’d say you were 
in trouble.” 

Maxwell sat down in the chair 
in front of Preston’s desk. “I 
suppose I am,” he said. “For one 
thing, it appears I’ve lost my job. 
Is there such a thing as tenure 
in a case like mine?” 

“A case like yours?” the attor- 
ney asked. “Just what is the 
situation? No one seems to know. 
Everyone is talking about it, but 
no one seems to know. I, my- 
self 

Maxwell grinned, wryly. “Sure. 
You’d like to know. You’re puz- 
zled and confused and not quite 
sure you’re sane. You sit there 
wondering if I’m really Peter 
Maxwell.” 

“Well, are you?” Preston asked. 

“I am sure I am. I wouldn’t 
blame you, or anyone, if you 
doubted it. There were two of us. 
Something happened to the wave 
pattern. One of us went to the 
GOBLIN RESERVATION 



Coonskin system, the other some- 
where else. The one who went to 
Coonskin came back to Earth 
and died. I came back yester- 
day.” 

’’And found that you were 
dead.” 

Maxwell nodded. “My apart- 
ment had been rented, my pos- 
sessions all are gone. The univer- 
sity tells me my position has been 
filled and I’m without a job.” 

Preston leaned back in his 
chair and squinted thoughtfully 
at Maxwell. “Legally,” he said, 
“I think we’d find that the uni- 
versity stands on solid ground. 
You are dead, you see. You have 
no tenure now. Not, at least, un- 
til it can be re-established.” 

“Through a long process at 
law?” 

“Yes, I would suspect so. I 
can’t give you an honest answer. 
There is no precedent. Oh, there 
are cases of mistaken identity — 
someone who is dead being mis- 
takenly identified as someone 
who is still alive. But with you, 
there’s no mistake. A man who 
undeniably was Peter Maxwell 
is undeniably dead. There is no 
precedent for that. We’d have to 
set our own precedent as we went 
along, a very laborious beating 
through the thickets of legal ar- 
gument. It might take years. To 
tell you the truth, I’m not sure 
where or how to start. Oh, it could 
be developed, it could be carried 

69 



forward, but it would take a lot 
of work and thought. First, qf 
course, we’d have to establish 
who you are.” 

“Who I really am? For God’s 
sake, Al! We know who I am.” 
“But the law doesn’t. The law 
wouldn’t recognize you as you are 
today. You have no legal being. 
Absolutely none. All your identi- 
fication cards have been turned in 
to Records and have been filed 
by now , . ” 

“But I have those cards,” said 
Maxwell quietly. “Right here in 
my pocket.” 

Preston stared at him. “Yes, 
come to think of it, I suppose you 
have. Oh Lord, what a mess!” 

T Te got up and walked across 
*■ the room, shaking his head. 
At the wall, he turned around 
and came back. He sat down 
again. 

“Let me think about it,” he 
said. “Give me a little time. I 
can dig up something. We have 
to dig up something. And there’s 
a lot to do. There’s the matter 
of your will . ” 

“My will? I’d forgot about the 
will. Never thought of it.” 

“It’s in probate. But I can get 
a stay of some sort.” 

“I willed everything to my 
brother, who’s with the Explora- 
tory Service. I could get in touch 
with him, although it might be 
quite a chore. He’s usually out 

70 



with the fleet. But the point is 
that there’ll be no trouble there, 
as soon as he knows what hap- 
pened.” 

“Not with him,” said' Preston. 
“But the court’s a different mat- 
ter. It can be done, of course, but 
it may take time. Until it’s clear- 
ed, you’ll have no claim to your 
estate. You own nothing except 
the clothes you stand in and what 
is in your pockets.” 

“The University offered me a 
post on Gothic IV. Dean of a re- 
search unit. But at the moment, 
I’m not about to take it.” 

“How are you fixed for cash?” 
“I’m all right. For the present. 
Oop took me in, and I have some 
money. If I had to, I could pick 
up some sort of job. Harlow 
Sharp would help me out if I 
needed something. Go on one of 
his field trips, if nothing else. I 
think I might like that.” 

“But don’t you have to have 
some sort of Time degree?” 

“Not if you go as a working 
member of the expedition. To 
hold a supervisory post of some 
sort, it would take one, I sup- 
pose.” 

“Before I start moving,” Pres- 
ton said, “I’ll have to know the 
details. Everything that happen- 
ed.” 

“I’ll write out a statement for 
you. Have it notarized. Anything 
you want.” 

“Seems, to me,” said Preston, 
GALAXY 



“we might file action against 
Transportation. They put you in 
this mess.” 

Maxwell hedged. “Not right 
now,” 'he said. “We can think of 
it later on.” 

“You get that statement put 
together,” Preston told him. “And 
in the meantime, I’ll do some 
thinking and look up some law. 
Then we can make a start. Have 
you seen the papers or looked at 
television?” 

Maxwell shook his head. “I 
haven’t had the time.” 

“They’re going wild,” said 
Preston. “It’s a wonder they 
haven’t cornered you. They must 
be looking for you. All they have 
as yet is conjecture. You were 
seen last night at the Pig 8c Whis- 
tle by a lot of people. The line 
right now is that you’ve come 
back from the dead. If I were 
you, I’d keep out of their way. 
If they should catch up with you, 
tell them absolutely nothing.” 

“I have no intention to,” said 
Maxwell. 

They sat in the quiet office, 
looking silently at one another. 

“What a mess!” said Preston, 
finally. “What a lovely mess! I 
believe, Pete, I might just enjoy 
this.” 

“By the way,” said Maxwell, 
“Nancy Clayton invited me to 
a party tonight. I’ve been won- 
dering if there might be some 
connection — although there 



needn’t be. Nancy used to invite 
me on occasion.” 

Preston grinned. “Why, you’re 
a celebrity. You’d be quite a 
catch for Nancy.” 

“I’m not too sure of that,” said 
Maxwell. “She must have heard 
I had shown up. She’d be curi- 
ous, of course.” 

“Yes,” said Preston, drily, “she 
would be curious.” 

XIV 

]V Maxwell expected that he 
might find newsmen lying in 
wait for him at Oop’s shack, but 
there was no one there. Apparent- 
ly the word hadn’t spread that 
he was staying there. 

The shack stood in the drowsi- 
ness of late afternoon, with the 
autumn sunlight pouring like 
molten gold over the weather- 
beaten lumber scraps of which it 
had been built. A few bees buzz- 
ed lazily in a bed of asters that 
grew outside the door and down 
the stretch of hillside above the 
roadway a few yellow butterflies 
drifted in the hazy afternoon. 

Maxwell opened the door and 
stuck in his head. There was no 
one there. Oop was off prowling 
somewhere, and there was no sign 
of Ghost. A banked fire glowed 
redly in the fireplace. 

Maxwell shut the door and sat 
down on the bench that stood 
before the shack. 



GOBLIN RESERVATION

Far to the west one of the cam- 
pus’ four lakes shone as a thin 
blue lens. The countryside was 
painted brown and yellow by 
dead sedges and dying grasses. 
Here and there little islands of 
color flared in scattered groups 
of trees. 

Warm and soft, thought Max- 
well. A land that one could dream 
in. Unlike those violent, gloomy 
landscapes that Lambert had 
painted so many years ago. 

He sat wondering why those 
landscapes should stick so tight- 
ly, like a burr against his mind. 
Wondering, too, how the artist 
could have known how the ghost- 
ly inhabitants of the crystal plan- 
et flickered. It could not be mere- 
ly happenstance; it was not the 
sort of thing a man might readily 
imagine. Reason said that Lam- 
bert must have known about 
those ghostly people; reason just 
as plainly said it was impossible. 

And what about all those other 
creatures, all those other gro- 
tesque monstrosities Lambert had 
spread with an insane, vicious 
brush across the canvasses? 
Where did they fit in? Where 
might they have come from? Or 
were they simply mad figments 
of imagination, tom raw and 
bleeding from a strangely tor- 
tured mind? Were the people of 
the crystal planet the only au- 
thentic creatures Lambert had 
depicted? It did not seem too 



likely. Somewhere or other, some- 
how or other, Lambert must have 
seen these other creatures, too. 
And was the landscape pure im- 
agination, brushed in to maintain 
the mood established by the crea- 
tures, or might it have been the 
landscape of the crystal planet 
at some other time, before it had 
been fixed forever in the floor 
and roof that shut it in against 
the universe? But that, he told 
himself, was impossible! The 
planet had 'been enclosed' before 
the present universe was bom. 
Ten billion years at least, per- 
haps as much as fifty billion. 

Maxwell stirred uneasily. It 
made no sense at all. None of 
it made any sort of sense. He had 
trouble enough, he told himself, 
without worrying about Lam- 
bert’s paintings. He had lost his 
job, his estate was locked in pro- 
bate, he didn’t have a legal stand- 
ing as a human being. 

But none of that mattered too 
much, not right now, anyhow. 
First came the matter of the 
hoard of knowledge on the crys- 
tal planet. It was a knowledge 
the University must have — a 
body of knowledge in the known 
galaxy. Some of it would dupli- 
cate what was already known, 
but there would be other huge 
areas of understanding wrtiich 
were yet unthought of. The little 
that he had had the time to see 
bolstered that belief. 



72 



GALAXY 



/"Vnce again, it seemed, he was 
^ hunkered down before the 
table, almost like a coffee table, 
on which he’d piled the metal 
sheets he had taken from the 
shelves, and with the contraption 
that was a reader, an interpreter, 
call it what one might, fastened 
to his head. 

There had been the sheet of 
metal that talked about the mind, 
not in metaphysical nor in philo- 
sophic terms, but as a mechan- 
ism, employing terms and con- 
cepts that he could not grasp. 
He had struggled with the term- 
inology, for he knew that here 
was understanding no human yet 
had touched, but it was beyond 
him. And there was that other 
piece of metal, a basic text on 
the application of certain math- 
ematical principles to the social 
sciences, although some of the 
social sciences that were men- 
tioned he could only guess at, 
groping after the concepts as a 
blind man might grope after flit- 
ting butterflies. There had been 
histories not of one universe, but 
two — and natural history which 
had told of life forms so fantas- 
tic in their basic principles and 
their functions that they seemed 
unbelievable, and a very thin 
sheet of metal, so thin it bent and 
twisted, like a sheet of paper, 
when he handled it, that had been 
so far beyond his understanding 
that he could not quite be sure 



what it was about And a thicker 
piece of metal, a much thicker 
piece, wherein he read the 
thoughts and philosophies of 
creatures and of cultures long 
since gone to dust that had sent 
him reeling back, frightened, dis- 
gusted, outraged and dismayed, 
but still full of a fearful wonder, 
at the utter inhumanity expressed 
in those philosophies. 

All that and more, much more, 
a trillion times more, was wait- 
ing out there on the crystal plan- 
et. 

It was important, he reminded 
himself, that he carry out the 
assignment that he had been giv- 
en. It was vital that the library 
of the crystal planet be attained, 
and quickly. For if he failed there 
was a good possibility that the 
planet would seek another mar- 
ket, offer what it had in another 
sector of the galaxy, or perhaps 
out of the galaxy entirely. 

The Artifact, he told himself, 
could be the price. 

A flight of blackbirds came 
swirling down out of the sky, 
skimming just above the roof of 
the shack, sailing over the road- 
way. Maxwell watched them set- 
tle into the dying vegetation of 
a stretch of marsh, balancing 
their bodies delicately on the 
bending stems of rank-growing 
weeds, come there to feed for an 
hour or so before flying off to 



GOBLIN RESERVATION 



73 



roost in some secluded woodland 
they had picked as bivouac on 
their migration southward. 

Maxwell got up and stretched. 
The peace and the quiet of the 
tawny afternoon had soaked into 
his body. He’d like a nap, he 
thought. After a time Oop would 
come back home and wake him 
and they’d have something to 
eat and talk for a while before 
he went off to Nancy’s. 

He opened the door and went 
into the shack, crossing the floor 
to sit upon the bed. Maybe, he 
thought, he ought to see if he 
still had a clean shirt and an 
extra pair of socks to don before 
the party. He reached out and 
hauled his bag off the floor and 
dumped it on the bed. 

Opening the catches, he threw 
back the lid and took out a pair 
qf trousers to get at the shirts 
that were packed beneath them. 
The shirts were there and so was 
something else, a contraption 
with a headband and two eye- 
pieces folded up against it. 

He stared at it in wonder, rec- 
ognizing it. It was the translator 
which he had used on the crystal 
planet to read the metal tablets. 
He lifted it out and let it dangle 
in his hand. Here was the band 
to clamp around the head, with 
the power pack in the back, and 
the two eyepieces one flipped 
down into position once the de- 
vice was fastened on the head. 

74 



He must have packed it by 
mistake, he thought, although he 
cpuld not, for the life of him, 
remember packing it. But there 
it was. Perhaps no harm was 
done. It might even be used at 
some future time to help sub- 
stantiate his claim he had been 
on the planet. It was not good 
evidence. It was just a gadget 
that had an ordinary look about 
it, although it might not seem so 
ordinary if someone poked 
around in the mechanism of it. 

A light tapping came from 
somewhere. Maxwell, surprised 
by so small a noise, stiffened and 
held himself rigid, listening. Per- 
haps a wind-blown branch, he 
thought, tapping on the roof, al- 
though it didn’t sound like a 
branoh against the roof. 

The tapping stopped and then 
began again, this time not a 
steady rapping, but rather like a 
code. Three quick taps and then 
a pause, followed by two rapid 
taps and then another pause, with 
the pattern of the tapping re- 
peated once again. 

It was someone at the door. 

1\ Taxwell got up from the bed 
and stood undecided. It 
might be newsmen who had fin- 
ally tracked him down. If that 
should be the case, it might be 
best to leave the door unanswer- 
ed. But the tapping didn’t seem 
boisterous enough, or demand- 

GALAXY 



ing enough, for a newsman who 
had finally run him to his lair. 
The taps were soft, almost ten- 
tative, the kind of tapping that 
might be done by someone who 
did not want to advertise his 
presence. 

The tapping took up again. 
Maxwell trudged to the door and 
threw it open. Outside stood the 
Shrimp, a ghostly, gleaming 
white in the wash of sunlight. 
Beneath one of his limbs, which 
now served as an arm rather than 
a leg, he clutched a paper-wrap- 
ped bundle tight against his body. 

“For the love of God, come in,” 
said Maxwell, sharply, “before 
someone sees you here.” 

The Shrimp came in. Maxwell 
closed the door, wondering what 
it was that had caused him to 
urge it in. 

“You need no apprehension,” 
said the Shrimp, “about news 
harvesters. I was careful and I 
noticed. No one followed me. I’m 
such a foolish-looking creature 
no one ever follows me. No one 
ever accords to me any purpose 
whatsoever.” 

“That is a fortunate thing to 
have,” said Maxwell. “I think 
that it is called protective color- 
ation.” 

“I appear again,” said Shrimp, 
“on behalf of Miss Nancy Clay- 
ton. She knows you carried little 
on your trip, have had no chance 
to shop or ‘have laundry done. 



No wish to embarrass — charging 
me to say this with goodly em- 
phasis — but wish to send you 
clothes to wear.” 

He took the bundle from un- 
derneath his arm and handed it 
to Maxwell. 

“That is nice of Nancy.” 

“She is a thoughtful person. 
She commissioned me to say 
further.” 

“Go ahead,” said Maxwell. 
“There will be wheeled vehicle 
to take you to the house.” 
“There is no need of that,” 
said Maxwell. “The roadway runs 
right past her place.” 

“Once again apology,” said the 
Shrimp, with firmness, “but she 
thinks it best. There is much 
hithering and thithering, by many 
types of creatures, to learn your 
whereabouts.” 

“Can you tell me,” asked Max- 
well. “how Miss Clayton knows 
my whereabouts?” 

Said the Shrimp, “I truly do 
not know.” 

“All right, then. You’ll thank 
Miss Clayton for me?” 

“With gladness,” said the 
Shrimp. 

XV 

tCT’ll take you around to the 
back,” the driver said. 
“There is a swarm of newsmen 
hanging around out front. They’ll 
be gone later on, but now they’re 



GOBLIN RESERVATION 



75 



there in droves. Miss Clayton 
suggested you might not want 
to meet them.” 

“Thank you,” Maxwell said. 
“It is thoughtful of you.” 

Nancy, he told himself, had 
taken over, as was her usual 
practice, viewing it as her pre- 
rogative to order people’s lives. 

Her house stood on the low 
bluff that hemmed in the western 
edge of the lake. Off to the left 
the water gleamed softly in the 
early moonlight. The front of the 
house was ablaze with light, but 
the back was dark. 

The car turned off the highway 
and climbed slowly along a nar- 
row driveway lined by massive 
oaks. A startled bird flew 
squawking across the roadway, 
a flurry of desperately beating 
wings caught for a moment in 
the headlights. A pair of dogs 
came raging down the hollow 
tunnel of the drive, split and 
swung on either side the car. 

The driver chuckled. “If you 
were walking, they’d eat you 
alive.” 

“But why?” asked Maxwell. 
“Why, all at once, must Nancy 
be guarded by a dog pack?” 

“Not Miss Clayton,” the driver 
said. “It is someone else.” 

The question came to Max- 
well’s tongue, but he choked it 
back. 

The driver swung the car into 
a curved driveway that ran be- 

76 



neath an open portico and pulled 
up to a halt. 

“In the back door,” the driver 
said. “You don’t need to knock. 
Then straight down the hall past 
the curved staircase. The party’s 
up in front.” 

Maxwell started to open the 
car door, then hesitated. 

“You need not mind the dogs,” 
the driver told him. “They rec- 
ognize the car. Anyone who steps 
out of it is okay with them.” 

There was, in fact, no sign of 
the dogs, and Maxwell went 
swiftly up the three steps of the 
stoop, opened the back door and 
stepped into the hall. 

The hall was dark. A little light 
filtered down the winding stair- 
case — someone apparently had 
left on a light on the second story. 
But that was all; there were no 
other lights. From somewhere in 
the front of the house came the 
muffled sound of revelry. 

T T e stood for a moment without 
-*• ^ moving. As his eyes became 
accustomed to the darkness he 
could see that the hall ran for 
some distance toward the center 
of the house, past the foot of the 
winding stairs and beyond. There 
was a door back there, or per- 
haps an abrupt turn in the hall, 
that would take him party-ward. 

It was strange, he told him- 
self. If Nancy had instructed the 
driver to bring him to the back, 



GALAXY 



she would have had someone 
there to greet him, or at least 
would have seen that there was 
a light so he could find his way. 

Strange, and very awkward, to 
arrive this way, to grope his way 
along the hall in search of the 
others who were there. For a mo- 
ment he considered turning about 
and leaving, making his way back 
to Oop’s place. Then he remem- 
bered the dogs. They would be 
out there and waiting and they 
looked like vicious brutes. 

This whole business, he told 
himself, was not at all like Nancy. 
Nancy wouldn’t do a thing like 
this. There was something very 
wrong, and he did not like it. 

He moved cautiously down the 
hall, alert for chair or table that 
might be there to trip him up. 
He could see a little better now, 
but the hall was still a tunnel 
without any details. 

He passed the stairs, skirting 
around their base, and now, with 
the light from the stairway par- 
tially cut off, the hall became 
darker than it was before. 

A voice asked, “Professor Max- 
well? Is that you, Professor?” 

Maxwell stopped in mid- 
stride, balancing on one leg, then 
carefully put his lifted foot down 
against the floor and stood, not 
stirring, while goose bumps prick- 
led on his skin. 

“Professor Maxwell,” said the 
voice, “I know that you’re there.” 



It was not a voice, actually, or 
it didn’t seem to be. There had 
been no sound, Maxwell could 
have sworn, yet he had heard 
the words, not so much, perhaps, 
in his ear, as somewhere in his 
brain. 

He felt the terror mounting in 
him and he tried to fight off, but 
it didn’t go away. It stayed, 
crouched somewhere out there in 
the dark, ready to rush in. 

He tried to speak and gulped 
instead. The voice said, “I’ve 
waited here for you, Professor. I 
want to communicate with you. 
It is to your interest as much as 
it is to mine.” 

“Where are you?” Maxwell 
asked. 

“Through the door just to your 
left.” 

“I do not see a door.” 

Good common sense hammer- 
ed hard at Maxwell. Break and 
run, it said. Get out of here as 
fast as you can go. 

But he couldn’t break and run. 
He couldn’t bring himself to do 
it. And if he ran, which way 
should he run? Not back to the 
door, for the dogs were waiting 
out there. Not clattering down 
the darkened hall, more than 
likely to bump into something 
and raise a terrible clatter, to 
alert the guests up there in front 
and to be found, when they in- 
vestigated, disheveled and bruis- 
ed and sweating with his fear.

For if he ran, he knew, fear would 
pounce upon him and he’d give 
way to it. 

It was bad enough sneaking in 
from the back door on a party 
without being found in a con- 
dition such as that. 

If it had been just a voice, any 
kind of voice, it would not have 
been so frightening, but it was a 
strange kind of voice — there 
was no intonation to it, and there 
was about it a certain raw, me- 
chanical, almost rasping quality. 

It was not a human voice, 
Maxwell told himself. There was 
an alien in that room. 

CC'Tphere is a door,” the flat, 
hard voice said. “Step 
slightly to your left and push 
against it.” 

The whole thing was becoming 
ridiculous, Maxwell told himself. 
Either he went through the door 
or he broke and ran. He might 
try to simply walk away, but he 
knew that the minute he turned 
his back upon that hidden door, 
he would run — not because he 
wanted to, but because he had 
to, running from the fear he had 
turned his back upon. 

He stepped to the left, found 
the door, and pushed. The room 
was dark, but from a lamp some- 
where in the yard outside, some 
light filtered through the win- 
dows, falling on a roly-poly crea- 
ture that stood in the center of 

78 



the room, its pudgy belly gleam- 
ing with a writhing phosphores- 
cence, as if a group of lumines- 
cent sea-dwellers had been pris- 
oned in a bowl. 

“Yes,” the creature said, “you 
are quite right. I am one of those 
beings that you call a Wheeler. 
For my visit here I have given 
myself a designation that falls 
easy on your mind. You may call 
me Mr. Marmaduke. For con- 
venience only, I suspect you un- 
derstand, for it’s not my name. 
In fact, none of us have names. 
They are unnecessary. Our per- 
sonal identity is achieved in an- 
other way.” 

“I am pleased to meet you, 
Mr. Marmaduke,” said Maxwell, 
speaking slowly, the only way he 
could, since his lips had become, 
like the rest of him, slightly 
stiff and frozen. 

“And I you, Professor.” 

“How did you know who I 
was?” asked Maxwell. “You 
seemed to have no doubt at all. 
You knew, of course, I’d be com- 
ing down the hall.” 

“Of course,” the Wheeler said. 

Now Maxwell could see the 
creature a bit more clearly, the 
bloated body supported on two 
wheels, the lower part of the body 
gleaming and twisting like a pail 
of worms. 

“You are Nancy’s guest?” he 
asked. 

“Yes,” said Mr. Marmaduke, 
GALAXY 



“certainly I am. The guest of 
honor, I believe, at this gather- 
ing.” 

“Then, perhaps, you should be 
out with the other guests.” 

“I pleaded tiredness,” said Mr. 
Marmaduke. “A slight prevarica- 
tion, I must admit, since I am 
never tired. So I went to rest a 
while . .” 

“And to wait for me?” 

“Precisely,” said Mr. Marma- 
duke. 

Nancy, Maxwell thought. No, 
Nancy, he was sure, wasn’t in on 
it. She had a frothy brain, and all 
she cared about were her ever- 
lasting parties, and She’d be in- 
capable of any kind of subtle in- 
trigue. 

“There is a subject we can 
talk about,” said Mr. Marma- 
duke, “with some profit, I pre- 
sume, to both of us. You are 
looking for a buyer for a large 
commodity. I might have some 
interest in that particular com- 
modity.” 

Maxwell moved back a step 
and tried to find an answer. But 
there was no ready answer. Al- 
though he should have known, 
he told himself, or have at least 
suspected. 

“You say nothing,” said Mr. 
Marmaduke. “I cannot be mis- 
taken. You are, without fail, the 
agent for the sale?” 

“Yes,” said Maxwell. “Yes, I 
am the agent.” 

GOBLIN RESERVATION 



nphcre was no use denying it, 
he knew. Somehow or other, 
this creature in the room knew 
about the other planet and the 
hoard of knowledge. And he 
might know the price as well. 
Could it have been the Wheeler, 
he wondered, who had made the 
offer for the Artifact? 

“Well, then,” said Mr. Mar- 
maduke, “let us proceed Imme- 
diately to business and a discus- 
sion of the terms. Not forgetting, 
in the course of it, to mention the 
commission that will be coming 
to you.” 

“I am afraid,” said Maxwell, 
“that is impossible at the mo- 
ment. I do not know the terms. 
You see, I was first to find a 
potential buyer and then — ” 
“No trouble whatsoever,” said 
Mr. Marmaduke, “for I have the 
knowledge that you lack.” 

“And you will pay the price?” 
“Oh, without any question,” 
said the Wheeler. “It will take 
just a little time. There are cer- 
tain negotiations which must be 
terminated. Once those are done, 
you and I can complete all busi- 
ness and the matter will be done, 
without any fuss or trouble. The 
only thing, it would appear to 
me, is a determination of the 
commission which you will have 
earned so richly.” 

“I would imagine,” said Max- 
well, bleakly, “that it might be 
a good commission.” 

79 



“We had in mind,” said Mr. 
Marmaduke, “naming you — 
shall we say librarian? — of the 
commodity we purchase. There 
will be much work working out 
the various commodities and 
codifying them. For work of this 
sort we will need a creature such 
as you, and I imagine that you 
might find the work highly in- 
teresting. And the salary — Pro- 
fessor Maxwell, we pray you 
name the salary and the condi- 
tions of employment.” 

“I would have to think about 
it.” 

“By all means,” said Mr. Mar- 
maduke. “In a procedure such as 
this, a little thought is good. You 
will not find us most disposed to 
generosity.” 

“That’s not what I meant,” 
said Maxwell. “I’ll have to think 
about the deal. Whether I’d be 
willing to arrange a sale for you.” 

“You doubt, perhaps, our 
worthiness to purchase the com- 
modity?” 

“That might be it,” said Max- 
well. 

"professor Maxwell,” said the 
Wheeler, “it would be ad- 
visable for you to lay aside your 
doubts. It is for the best that 
you entertain no doubt of us at 
all. For we are most determined 
that we shall obtain what you 
have to offer. So, in the best of 
grace, you should deal with us.” 



“Whether I want to or not?” 
asked Maxwell. 

“I,” said Mr. Marmaduke, 
“would have not put it quite so 
bluntly. But you state it most 
correctly.” 

“You are not in the best posi- 
tion,” Maxwell told him, “to 
speak in that tone of voice.” 

“You are not aware of the posi- 
tion that we hold,” the Wheeler 
said. “Your knowledge goes out 
to only a certain point in space. 
You cannot know what lies be- 
yond that point.” 

There was something in the 
words, something in the way that 
they were said, which sent a 
chill through Maxwell, as if from 
some unknown quarter of the un- 
iverse a sharp, frigid blast of 
wind had blown through the 
room. 

Your knowledge goes only to a 
certain point in space, Mr. Mar- 
maduke had said, and what lay 
beyond that point? No one could 
know, of course, except that in 
certain areas beyond the shadowy 
frontier of man’s probing it was 
known the Wheelers had staked 
out an empire. And seeping across 
that frontier came horror stories, 
such tales as any frontier might 
inspire, stemming from man’s 
wonder concerning that unknown 
which lay just a little way ahead. 

There had been little contact 
with the Wheelers, and almost 
nothing was known of them — 



80 



GALAXY 



and that in itself was bad. There 
was no thrusting out of hands, 
no gestures of good will, either 
from the Wheelers or from the 
humans and their friends and 
allies. The frontier lay there, in 
that one great sector out in space, 
a silent, sullen line that neither 
side had crossed. 

“I would be better able to 
come to some decision,” Maxwell 
said, “if my knowledge did ex- 
tend, if we could know more 
about you.” 

“You know that we are bugs,” 
said Mr. Marmaduke, and the 
words fairly dripped with scorn. 
“You are intolerant . ” 

“Not intolerant,” said Max- 
well, angrily, “and we do not 
think of you as bugs. We know 
you are what we would call hive 
mechanisms. We know each of 
you is a colony of creatures simi- 
lar to the life forms that here 
on Earth we think of as insects, 
and that sets us apart from you, 
of course, but no more distant 
from us than many other crea- 
tures from many other stars. I 
do not like the word ‘intolerant’, 
Mr. Marmaduke, because it im- 
plies that there is ground for 
tolerance, and there is no such 
thing — not for you, nor I, nor 
any other creature in the uni- 
verse.” 

He found that he was shaking 
with his anger and he wondered 
why he should suddenly become 



so angry at a single word. He 
could remain calm at the thought 
of the Wheeler buying the knowl- 
edge of the crystal planet, then 
flare with sudden anger at one 
specific word. Perhaps because, 
he told himself, with so many 
different races who must live 
together, both tolerance and in- 
tolerance had become dirty 
words. 

“You argue well and amiably,” 
said Mr. Marmaduke, “and you 
may not be intolerant — ” 
“Even were there such a thing 
as intolerance,” said Maxwell, “I 
cannot understand why you’d re- 
sent it so. It would be a reflection 
upon the one who had exhibited 
it rather than upon the one to- 
ward whom it was directed. Not 
only a reflection upon good man- 
ners, but upon one’s basic knowl- 
edge. There can be nothing quite 
so stupid as intolerance.” 

“Then if not intolerance,” ask- 
ed the Wheeler, “what makes 
you hesitate?” 

1 4 T would have to know how 
-*■ you meant to use the com- 
modity. I would want to know 
your purpose. I would need to 
know a great deal more about 
you.” 

“So that you could judge?” 

“I don’t know,” said Maxwell, 
bitterly. “How can one judge a 
situation such as this?” 

“We talk too much,” said Mr. 

81 



GOBLIN RESERVATION 



Marmaduke. “And the talk is 
meaningless. I perceive you have 
no intention to make a deal with 
us.” 

“At the moment,” Maxwell 
told him, “I would say that you 
were right.” 

“Then,” said Mr. Marmaduke, 
“we must find another way. You 
will cause us, by your refusal, a 
great deal of time and trouble 
and we’ll be most ungrateful to 
you.” 

“I have a feeling,” Maxwell 
said, “that I can bear up under 
your ingratitude.” 

“There is a certain advantage, 
sir," warned Mr. Marmaduke, “to 
being on the winning side.” 

Something big and moving 
swiftly brushed past Maxwell, 
and out of the comer of his eye 
he caught the sudden flash of 
gleaming teeth and the streak of 
tawny body. 

“No, Sylvester!” Maxwell 
shouted. “Leave him alone, Syl- 
vester!" 

Mr. Marmaduke moved swift- 
ly. His wheels blurred as he spun 
and swept in a quick half circle, 
skirting Sylvester’s rushing charge 
and heading for the door. Syl- 
vester’s claws screeched as he 
turned, swapping end for end. 
Maxwell, seeing the Wheeler 
bearing down upon him, ducked 
out of the way, but a wheel graz- 
ed his Shoulder and brushed him 
roughly to one side. With a 



swish, Mr. Marmaduke went 
streaking out the door. Behind 
him came Sylvester, long and 
lithe, a tawny shape that seemed 
to flow smoothly through the air. 

“No, Sylvester!” Maxwell 
screamed, flinging himself 
through the door and making a 
quick turn in the hall, his legs 
pumping rapidly as he skidded 
on the turn. 

Ahead of him the Wheeler 
rolling smoothly down the hall, 
with Sylvester close behind him. 
Maxwell wasted' no more breath 
in yelling at the cat, but drove 
his body forward in pursuit. 

At the far end of the hall, Mr. 
Marmaduke swung smoothly to 
the left; and Sylvester, almost on 
top of him, lost precious seconds 
as he fought, and failed, to make 
as smooth a turn. Warned of the 
turning in the hall, Maxwell took 
it in his stride and ahead of him 
he saw a lighted corridor that led 
to a short marble staircase and 
beyond the staircase a crowd of 
people standing about in little 
knots, with glasses in their hands. 

Mr. Marmaduke was heading 
for the staircase, going very fast. 
Sylvester was one leap ahead of 
Maxwell, perhaps three leaps be- 
hind the Wheeler.

A >Taxwell tried to yell a warn- 
ing, but he didn’t have the

breath and, in any case, events 
were moving much too fast at 
this point. 

The Wheeler hit the top step 
of the staircase, and Maxwell 
launched his body through the 
air, arms outstretched. He came 
down on top of the saber-tooth 
and wrapped his arms around its 
neck. The two of them sprawled 
to the floor; and out of the comer 
of his eye, as he and Sylvester 
cartwheeled down the corridor, 
Maxwell saw the Wheeler bounc- 
ing high on the second step and 
beginning to tip over. 

And then, suddenly, there was 
the screaming of frightened wom- 
en and the yells of startled men 
and the crash of breaking glasses. 
For once, thought Maxwell grim- 
ly, Nancy was getting a bigger 
boot out of her party than she 
had bargained for. 

He piled up against a wall, at 
the far edge of the staircase. 
Somehow or other, Sylvester was 
perched on top of him and reach- 
ing down to lap fondly at his 
face. 

“Sylvester,” he said, “this was 
the time you did it. You g(?t us 
in a mess.” 

Sylvester went on lapping, and 
a rasping purr rumbled in his 
chest. 

Maxwell pushed the cat away 
and managed to slide up the wall 
to a sitting position. 

Out on the floor of the room 



beyond the staircase Mr. Mar- 
maduke lay upon his side, both 
wheels spinning crazily, the fric- 
tion of the wheel that was bot- 
tom-most making him rotate 
lopsidedly. 

Carol came running up the 
steps and stopped, with fists 
firmly on her hips, to stare down 
at Maxwell and the cat. 

“The two of you!” she cried, 
then choked with anger. 

“We’re sorry,” Maxwell said 
apologetically. 

“The guest of honor,” she 
screamed at them, almost weep- 
ing. “The guest of honor and you 
two hunting him down the halls 
as if he were a moose.” 

“Apparently we didn’t hurt 
him much,” said Maxwell. “I see 
he is intact. I wouldn’t have been 
surprised if his belly broke and 
all those bugs of his were scatter- 
ed on the floor.” 

“What will Nancy think?” 
Carol asked accusingly. 

“I imagine,” Maxwell told her, 
“that she’ll be delighted. There 
hasn’t been this much ruckus at 
one of her parties since the time 
the fire-eating amphibian out of 
the Nettle system set the Christ- 
mas tree on fire.” 

“You make those things up,” 
said Carol. “I don’t believe it 
happened.” 

“Cross my heart,” said Max- 
well. “I was here and saw it. 
Helped put out the fire.”

/"vut on the floor some of the 
guests had laid hold of Mr. 
Marmaduke and were pulling 
him over to stand upright on his 
wheels. Little serving robotics 
were scurrying about, picking up 
the broken glass and mopping up 
the floor where the drinks had 
spilled. 

Maxwell got to his feet, and 
Sylvester moved over close be- 
side him, rubbing against his legs 
and purring. 

Nancy had arrived from some- 
where and was talking with Mr. 
Marmaduke. A large circle of 
guests stood around and listened 
to the talk. 

“If I were you,” suggested 
Carol, “I’d skin out of here the 
best way that I could. I can’t 
imagine that you’ll be welcome 
here." 

“On the contrary,” Maxwell 
told her. “I’m always welcome 
here.” 

He started walking down the 
staircase, with Sylvester pacing 
regally beside him. Nancy turned 
and saw him, broke through the 
circle and came across the floor 
to meet him. 

“Pete!” she cried. “Then it’s 
really true. You are back again.” 

“Why, of course,” said Max- 
well. 

“I saw it in the papers, but I 
didn’t quite believe it. I thought 
it was a hoax or a gag of some 
sort.” 



“But you invited me,” said 
Maxwell. 

“Invited you?” 

She wasn’t kidding him. He 
could see she wasn’t kidding. 

“You mean you didn’t send 
a Shrimp . 

“A Shrimp?” 

“Well, a thing that looked like 
an overgrown shrimp.” 

She shook her head, and 
watching her face, Maxwell saw, 
with something of a shock, that 
she was growing old. There were 
many tiny wrinkles around the 
comers of her eyes that cosmetics 
failed to hide. 

“A thing that looked like a 
shrimp,” he said. “Said it was 
running errands for you. It said 
I was invited to the party. It 
said a car would be sent to fetch 
me. It even brought me clothes, 
because it said . ” 

“Pete,” said Nancy, “please 
believe me. I did none of this. I 
did not invite you. But I’m glad 
you’re here.” 

She moved closer and laid a 
hand upon his arm. Her face 
crinkled in a giggle. “And I’ll be 
interested in hearing about what 
happened between you and Mr. 
Marmaduke.” 

“That I’m sorry about,” said 
Maxwell. 

“No need to be. He’s my guest, 
of course, and one must be con- 
siderate of guests, but he’s a real- 
ly terrible person. Pete, he’s bas-

ically a bore and a snob and . .” 
“Not now,” Maxwell warned 
her, softly. 

Mr. Marmaduke had disengag- 
ed himself from the circle of 
guests and was wheeling across 
the floor toward them. Nancy 
turned to face him. 

“You’re all right?” she asked. 
“You really are all right?” 
“Very right,” said Mr. Marma- 
duke. 

TTe wheeled close to Maxwell, 
-*• and an arm extruded from 
the top of his roly-poly body — 
a ropelike, flexible arm more like 
a tentacle than an arm, with three 
clawlike fingers on the end of it. 
He reached out with it and drap- 
ed it around Maxwell’s shoulders. 
At the pressure of it, Maxwell 
had the instinct to shrink away, 
but with an exercise of conscious 
will forced himself not to stir. 

“I thank you, sir,” said Mr. 
Marmaduke. “I am most grate- 
ful to you. You saved my life, 
perhaps. Just as I fell I saw you 
leap upon the beast. It was most 
heroic.” 

Pressed tight against Maxwell’s 
side, Sylvester lifted his head, 
dropped his lower jaw, exhibiting 
his fangs in a silent snarl. 

“He would not have hurt you, 
sir,” said Carol. “He’s as gentle 
as a kitten. If you had not run, 
he’d not have chased you. He had 
the fool idea that you were play- 



ing with him. Sylvester likes to 
play.” 

Sylvester yawned, with a fine 
display of teeth. 

“This play,” said Mr. Marma- 
duke, “I do not care about.” 
“When I saw you fall,” said 
Maxwell, “I was fearful for you. 
I thought for a moment you 
would burst wide open.” 

“Oh, no need of fear,” said Mr. 
Marmaduke. “I am extremely 
resilient. The body is rrtade of 
excellent material. It is strong 
and has a bouncing quality.” 

He removed his arm from Max- 
well’s shoulder, and it ran like an 
oily rope, writhing in the air, to 
plop back into his body. There 
was no mark on the body surface, 
Maxwell noticed, to indicate 
where it might have disappeared. 

“You’ll excuse me, please,” 
said Mr. Marmaduke. “There’s 
someone I must see.” He wheeled 
about and rolled rapidly away. 

Nancy shuddered. “He gives 
me the creeps,” she said. “Al- 
though I must admit he is a 
great attraction. It isn’t every 
hostess who can snag a Wheeler. 
I don’t mind telling you, Pete, 
that I pulled a lot of wires to get 
him for a house guest, and now I 
wish I hadn’t. There’s a slimy 
feel about him.” 

“Do you know why he’d be 
here — here on Earth, I mean?” 
“No, I don’t. I get the impres- 
sion that he’s a simple tourist. 



86 



GALAXY 



Although I don’t imagine such a 
creature could be a simple tour- 
ist.” 

“I think you’re right,” said 
Maxwell. 

“Pete,” she said, “tell me about 
yourself. The papers say . ” 

TTe grinned. “I know. That I 
-*• came back from the dead.” 
“But you didn’t, really. I know 
that’s not impossible. Who was 
that we buried? Everyone, you 
must understand, simply every- 
one, was at the funeral, and we 
all thought it was you. But it 
couldn’t have been you. What- 
ever could have — ” 

“Nancy," said Maxwell, “I 
came back only yesterday. I 
found that I was dead and that 
my apartment had been rented 
and that I had' lost my job.” 

“It seems impossible,” said 
Nancy. “Such things just don’t 
happen. I don’t see how this hap- 
pened.” 

“I’m not entirely clear about 
it all myself,” Maxwell told her. 
“Later, I suppose, I’ll find out 
more about it” 

“Anyway,” said Nancy, “you 
are here, and everything’s all 
right; and if you don’t want to 
talk about it, I’ll circulate the 
word that you would rather not.” 
“That’s kind of you,” said 
Maxwell, “but it wouldn’t work.” 
“You don’t need to worry 
about newspapermen,” said Nan- 



cy. “There are no newspaper peo- 
ple here. I used to let them come. 
A hand-picked few, ones I 
thought that I could trust. But 
you can’t trust any of them. I 
found that out the hard way. So 
you won’t be bothered.” 

“I understand you have a 
painting . ” 

“You know about the painting, 
then. Let’s go and look at it. It’s 
the proudest thing I have. Im- 
agine it, a Lambert! And one 
that had dropped entirely out of 
sight. I’ll tell you later how it 
happened to be found, but I 
won’t tell you what it cost me. 
I won’t tell anyone. I’m ashamed 
of what it cost me.” 

“Much or little?” 

“Much,” said Nancy, “and you 
have to be so careful. It’s so easy 
to be swindled. I wouldn’t even 
talk of buying it until I had it 
examined by an expert. In fact, 
two experts. One to check against 
the other, although I suppose 
that was unnecessary.” 

“But there’s no doubt it is a 
Lambert?” 

“No doubt at all. I was almost 
sure, myself. No one else ever 
painted quite like Lambert. But 
he could be copied, of course, and 
I had to be sure.” 

“What do you know about 
Lambert?” Maxwell asked. 
“Something more than the rest 
of us? Something that’s not 
found its way into books?”

“No. Really not a great deal. 
Not about the man himself. Why 
do you ask?” 

“Because you are so excited.” 
“Well, really! Just finding an 
unknown Lambert is enough, of 
course. I have two other paint- 
ings of his, but this one is some- 
thing special because it had been 
lost. Well, actually I don’t know 
if lost is the word or not. Never 
known, perhaps, would be better. 
No record of his ever painting it. 
No record that survived, at least. 
And it is one of his so-called 
grotesques. You would hardly 
think one of them could be lost 
or mislaid or whatever happened 
to it. One of his earlier ones, that 
might be understandable.” 

They worked their way across 
the floor, skirting the little clus- 
tered groups of guests. 

“Here it is,” said Nancy. 

T hey had pushed their way 
through a crowd that had 
been grouped in front of the wall 
on which the painting hung. Max- 
well tilted his head to stare up at 
it. 

It was somehow different than 
the color plates he had seen in 
the library that morning. This 
was because, he told himself, of 
the larger size of the painting, 
the brilliance and the clarity of 
color, some of which had been 
lost in the color plates. But this, 
he realized, was not all of it. 



The landscape was different, and 
so were the creatures in it. A 
more Earth-like landscape — the 
sweep of gray hills and the brown 
of the shrubby vegetation that 
lay upon the land, the squatty 
fem-like trees. A troop of crea- 
tures that could be gnomes wend- 
ed their way across a distant 
hill; a goblin-like creature sitting 
at the base of a tree leaned back 
against the bole, apparently 
asleep, with some sort of hat 
pulled down across his eyes. And 
others — fearsome, leering crea- 
tures, with obscene bodies and 
faces that made the blood run 
cold. 

On the crest of a distant, flat- 
topped hill, about the base of 
which clustered a large crowd of 
many kinds of creatures, a small 
black blob stood outlined against 
the grayness of the sky. 

Maxwell drew in his breath in 
a startled gasp, took a quick step 
closer, then halted and stood stiff 
and straight, afraid to give him- 
self away. 

It seemed impossible that no 
one else could have noticed it, 
he told himself. Although, per- 
haps, someone had but had not 
thought it worth the mention. 

But for Maxwell there could be 
no doubt. He was sure of what 
he saw. That small black blob 
on the distant hilltop was the 
Artifact!

wasn't exactly an accident 
worst effects were all on 




nphe Costellos, two great little 
-*■ people well under five feet 
tall, had moved out of the one- 
bedroom apartment to the left of 
mine, and my neighbors and I 
wondered apprehensively who 
would move in. I know it’s true 
that you can live in a Manhattan 
apartment house all your life and 
never know your neighbors, but 
the tenth floor of our building 
was lively proof that this needn’t 
be so, and we wanted it to con- 
tinue. 

Dick and Charlotte Fort (two 
bedrooms, to right of my apart- 
ment) were airily positive that 
we would assimilate whoever it 
might be. The Masons (three 



bedrooms, across the hall) could 
use another cheery sitter for their 
manic kids, for the Costellos had 
always been happy to oblige. 
Betty Snowden (one bedroom, 
left of the Masons) hoped the 
new tenant(s?) would like Max- 
well, her big, but big, cat. Being 
closest to the vacant apartment, 
I wished for somebody quiet who 
wouldn’t mind my typing late 
and might welcome an occasional 
visit, as everybody on the tenth 
floor did. 

After the painters were finish- 
ed, two men put down green wall- 
to-wall carpeting. Furniture was 
brought in. On the door under 
the peep-hole appeared an in- 



89 



scrutable nameplate: J. McGiv- 
ney. Bachelor? Divorcee? Cou- 
ple? The name gave us no clue. 

It happened to be my lot to 
find out. And the way I found 
out was this: I had just come up 
with the mail and was about to 
close the door when I noticed that 
the damnable top screw of my 
lock had worked its way loose 
again. So I was standing with the 
door half open and turning the 
screw with my thumbnail and 
the elevator came up to the tenth 
floor. A perfectly ordinary-seem- 
ing woman in her forties emerged 
and headed toward me, key in 
hand. 

“Hello,” I said brightly, in- 
troducing myself. “And you’re 
Mrs. McGivney?” 

“Miss,” she said flatly, looking 
at what I was doing. 

It did look pretty silly, and I 
found myself babbling, “The top 
screw keeps coming out, and I 
keep having to screw it back in. 
Doesn’t yours?” 

“I don’t know what you mean,” 
she said and unlocked her door 
and went in, followed by the 
sound of doublelocking and 
chaining it. 

When I reported this to the 
Forts, they laughed me out of my 
embarrassment and said they 
would thaw her out. They put a 
couple of bottles of wine and 
some glasses on a tray and invited 
me to come along and see. Out in 



the hall, they rang Miss McGiv- 
ney’s bell. The peephole opened, 
and an eye stared at us. 

“We’re the Welcome Wagon!” 
cried Charlotte Fort gaily. 

“I didn’t order any,” said Miss 
McGivney, closing the peephole. 

The Forts stood there for a 
long moment before soberly go- 
ing back to their apartment, and 
I went into mine. We didn’t think 
of drinking the wine ourselves. 

Qo far, this doesn’t sound like 
^ the start of a remarkable sci- 
entific discovery, but it was, re- 
quiring only time and more data. 
It was Charlotte’s destiny to add 
the next item. 

“I never go out to the inciner- 
ator,” she chattered later. “That’s 
Dick’s job. But we had the peo- 
ple from the office over, and he 
went to bed feeling sick, and I 
couldn’t face all the empty bot- 
tles that had accumulated.” She 
shuddered. “So there I was in 
the middle of the night, clutch- 
ing liquor bottles, and guess who 
came out.” 

“Miss McGivney?” I supplied. 

She nodded. “I was pretty high 
myself, but not after she watched 
me struggle to put the empties 
down the incinerator. I crept in- 
to bed, positively ill with embar- 
rassment, and tried to wake Dick, 
but no soap.” 

“That’s ridiculous,” said Dick 
heartily. “What’s more natural 



90 



GALAXY 



than dumping a few bottles down 
the incinerator at two in the 
morning?” 

“Fifteen,” said Charlotte. “And 
it was four-thirty.” 

Dick, the Masons and I laugh- 
ed her out of it, of course. Only 
I knew how she felt; the others 
hadn’t met Miss McGivney yet. 

Sometime that summer, the 
Masons boys came home from 
camp for the weekend on their 
way to a dude ranch. Let Mrs. 
Mason tell it: 

“Mike had brought back a 
snake from camp. It was a pretty 
little one; but he couldn’t keep 
it, obviously, and I told him to 
take it to the ranch and let it go. 
A few hours after they left, the 
police and firemen charged out of 
the elevators and made for Miss 
McGivney’s apartment, clubs 
and axes at the ready. When they 
came out, I asked what had hap- 
pened. A snake, they told me, 
had wound up in her bathtub!” 

“And for that she called the 
police and fire department?” ask- 
ed Dick Fort, stunned. 

“Not only that,” said Mrs. 
Mason, “she scrubbed every inch 
of the place on her hands and 
knees!” 

“But why?” asked Mr. Mason. 

“To kill any eggs it may have 
laid. I know it’s biological non- 
sense, but the poor woman was 
hysterical.” 

The Masons were visited by 

THE RICHES OF EMBARRASSMENT 



executives from the management 
office, who made it clear that 
Mrs. Mason should not have con- 
fessed so readily, and the item 
made the local newspaper. We 
laughed them out of their em- 
barrassment, but we noticed that 
it was getting harder and harder 
to do and also that we never 
seemed to meet Miss McGivney 
except under embarrassing con- 
ditions. Only Dick Fort and Betty 
Snowden disagreed. They said 
we were getting a bit paranoid. 

XTou might say it was Betty’s 
-*• turn next, though not in per- 
son. Her sixteen-year-old niece 
from Ohio was visiting her — 
sleeping on the sofa because Bet- 
ty, if you remember, had only 
one bedroom — and the girl got 
up early and, in her shortie night- 
gown, went out into the hall to 
get the Sunday Times that Betty 
had delivered to her, when the 
door blew shut behind the girl. 
She rang the bell and banged on 
the door, but Betty had the bed- 
room door closed and Flents in 
her ears, a longtime practice. So 
her niece philosophically sat 
down on the welcome mat and 
started looking at the ads. That 
was when Miss McGivney came 
out on her way to early Mass. 

The girl smiled up at her as 
she waited for the elevator and 
tried to explain what had hap- 
pened to her. 



91 



“I don’t recall asking,” said 
Miss McGivney, and took the 
elevator. 

“Damn it,” I said when Betty 
finished, “is it us or what? These 
are the kind of things that happen 
once in years to anybody, yet she 
walks right into them every 
time!” 

“It’s your own fault,” said 
Dick. “If you’d used a screw- 
driver instead of your thumbnail, 
or you, Charlotte, could have 
waited for me to get rid of the 
bottles the next day, or your 
niece, Betty, might have turned 
the lock before going after the 
paper — ” 

“But why does Miss McGivney 
always come along at just the 
wrong moment?” argued Mrs. 
Mason. 

“Pure happenstance,” said 
Dick. “And not thinking ahead.” 

“That’s because you haven’t 
had her walk in on you like we 
have,” said Charlotte, too an- 
noyed to watch her English. 

“And she never will,” Dick 
said. “I think before I act.” 

If life were dramatically logi- 
cal, he should have been the next 
victim, but he wasn’t. I was. The 
Forts had invited me to dinner, 
but let me finish my day’s work 
instead of joining their company 
for cocktails. Finished, I phoned 
to beg off, being so tired that I 
needed a nap. As always, Char- 
lotte was gracious about it, and 



I lay down with a good con- 
science. 

It was dark when I awoke, long 
past the Forts’ dinnertime. I took 
a shower, dressed and went to- 
ward the kitchen to open some 
cans and eat standing up. But a 
slip of paper on the floor near 
the front door seemed to have 
Charlotte’s handwriting on it. I 
picked it up and read: “Look 
outside before you ha-ha make 
dinner for yourself. Then come 
on in and join us.” 

I opened the door. Out in the 
hall, directly in front of my door, 
was a collection of plates contain- 
ing uncooked spaghetti, Char- 
lotte’s famous meat balls and 
meat sauce, salad and dressing, 
Italian bread, and shrimp cock- 
tail and dessert. Just as I bent 
over to take them in, Miss Mc- 
Givney’s door opened. I straight- 
ened and said hello, determined 
not to offer any explanation. 

Looking at the things on the 
floor, she said, “Some sort of rit- 
ual?” 

My nerve broke, and I was 
blathering away when the eleva- 
tor saved me from further embar- 
rassment. After morosely eating, 
,1 went next door, downed two 
highballs, and told Dick and 
Charlotte what had transpired. 

Dick shouted, “Listen to this, 
people!” and uproariously re- 
peated my story. It took me a 
long time to forgive him. As a 



92 



GALAXY 



matter of fact, it wasn’t until he 
met Miss McGivney face to face 
for the first time; he left for work 
before she did and came home 
earlier, so they just hadn’t crossed 
paths. 

This fateful morning, Dick had 
overslept. He threw on his clothes, 
yelling to Charlotte that he didn’t 
have time for breakfast, and was 
waiting for the elevator when he 
noticed that his zipper was open. 
He gave it a yank — and snagged 
his boxer shorts. 

Need I tell you who appeared 
at that very instant? 

A/Tuch stuff has flowed under 
the thing since then, includ- 
ing Miss McGivney and the Ma- 
sons and me moving away, and 
Betty’s cat died, so she took a 
sabbatical without feeling guilty, 
and though I still correspond 
with the Forts, we’ve stopped de- 
bating Miss McGivney and our 
awful moments. It’s all very 
clear, at least to me. 

As I said earlier, she led to a 
remarkable scientific discovery, 
and so she did. In years of cease- 
less research, I have never found 
any discussion, much less theory, 
concerning the power that Miss 
McGivney clearly possessed. This 



can therefore be counted a First. 
Here it is : 

Using a previously unknown 
and unsuspected ESP faculty of 
the mind, Miss McGivney un- 
consciously manufactured embar- 
rassing incidents. 

We on the tenth floor weren’t 
so much victims as puppets. That 
was bad enough — but can you 
imagine what life would be like 
if you had her power? Wherever 
you entered or exited, somebody 
would inevitably be doing some- 
thing that you much preferred 
not to witness, let alone have ex- 
plained unconvincingly to you. If 
you were devout, like her, 
thoughts in the form of prayers 
like these might race through 
your mind as you steel yourself 
to go out each morning: “Dear 
Lord, don’t let me see anything 
upsetting today! Save me from 
disgusting sights! Make people 
act like people instead of ani- 
mals!” 

And, naturally, these thoughts 
would create what you are pray- 
ing not to occur, and the harder 
you pray, the more inevitable 
they become. 

Poor Miss McGivney! Poor 
world of Miss McGivney!

Brain Drain 

by JOSEPH P. MARTINO 



We're the modern headhunters 
— and very particular about 
whose heads we want to hunt! 




Tt was a beautiful day. The sky 
was clear and had that dark 
blue color you usually see only 
in advertisements for summer re- 
sorts. The sun was pleasantly 
warm, and the breeze on my face 
was pleasantly cool. After six 
months of sweltering down on the 
Bangkok Plain, this was sheer 
heaven. I leaned back in the sad- 
dle of my Suzuki motor scooter 
and breathed deeply. 

But let me introduce myself. 
I’m Tom Harrison, and I work 
for Intelligence Imports Incor- 
porated. A year ago Triple-I pull- 
ed me out of Nigeria, where I had 
been working for over two years, 
put me through a crash course in 



Thai and sent me to Bangkok. 
I spent the next six months 
sloshing around in the paddy 
fields between Bangkok and Lop- 
buri, looking for bright young 
kids who could be recruited to go 
to work in the States. Not to 
mention swatting mosquitoes and 
getting rained on. Then the Com- 
pany decided that area was pretty 
well worked out and sent me up- 
country, to the Korat Plateau. 
It’s only about a hundred and 
sixty miles from Bangkok, but 
the thousand feet of altitude 
makes all the difference in the 
world. 

I don’t mind being shifted 
around like that, either. In fact, 
I like traveling. The only reason 
I resigned from the Special Forc- 



94 



es after five years was that they 
kept sending me to some pretty 
unfriendly places. But the places 
Triple-I sends me to are reason- 
ably friendly. Miserable, maybe, 
but friendly. 

So when they send me to a 
nice place like this, I make a 
point of enjoying it, and this was 
a place I could enjoy. The hills 
were steep and covered with 
green. The valley floors were 
covered with little stands of hard- 
wood trees, alternating with fields 
of com, almost ready for harvest- 
ing. I told myself if it weren’t for 
the occasional thatched huts, and 
the banana trees in the fore- 
ground, this place could easily be 
mistaken for eastern Pennsylvan- 
ia, around Susquehanna County. 
It was enough to make me home- 
sick. 

But my Suzuki suddenly yank- 
ed me back to Thailand, as the 
front wheel dropped into a chuck- 
hole and nearly pitched me out 
of the saddle. I recovered quick- 
ly and started paying more at- 
tention to the road. It was really 
nothing more than two parallel 
ruts made by hundreds of ox- 
carts over dozens of years. Two 
days ago I’d left Korat, the pro- 
vincial capital, and followed a 
paved road north to Non Tai, 
which is the equivalent of the 
County Seat. I’d spent the night 
there, then struck out across 
country by cart track, towards 



my destination, the village of 
Song Hong. 

After a few more miles, the 
thatched huts started getting 
closer together, and I figured I 
must be getting close to Song 
Hong. As I rode into a stand of 
trees, two stray dogs lying beside 
the road got up and barked at 
me. That was a pretty good sign 
the village was close. But the 
clincher came a hundred yards or 
so farther along. A cluster of 
small boys, too young to be in 
school, and stark naked except 
for T-shirts, started yelling “far- 
ang, farang" and followed me 
down the road. Sure enough, as I 
came out of the trees, there was 
the village. 

Qong Hong means, literally, two 
k "-' rooms. But evidently the vil- 
lage had grown some since it had 
been named. There must have ' 
been a couple of hundred people 
living in it. The main street was 
winding and crooked, as though 
it had originally been a cow- path, 
but it was wide enough for two 
ox-carts and was covered with 
gravel, so it would be usable even 
in the wet season. Along both 
sides of the street there were one- 
and two-story thatched huts, 
looking well built and in good 
repair. About halfway through 
the village was a wooden frame 
building, surrounded by a fence 
of bamboo poles. It was evidently 



BRAIN DRAIN 



95 



used as the town hall and police 
station, judging by the Thai flag 
flying from a pole in the court- 
yard. And off through the trees 
I could make out the orange and 
green tile roof of a Buddhist 
temple. 

I pulled off to the side of the 
street and dragged a map out of 
my saddlebag. I found the school 
on the map, about half a mile 
beyond the village. According to 
the records I’d examined in Non 
Tai, the school served a fairly 
large district. It had all twelve 
grades and almost five hundred 
students. I looked at my watch 
and decided that since it was just 
past noon. I’d eat lunch before 
I went to the school. 

By this time almost a dozen 
kids had gathered around me, 
just standing there silently and 
staring. I picked the biggest and 
asked him, in Thai, where the 
restaurant was located. He blink- 
ed at me, startled, then managed 
to get out that it was that way 
and around the comer. I guess 
he didn’t expect a fatang to 
speak Thai. As I started the 
scooter, the kids stepped aside 
to let me through, and I rode off. 
I spotted the restaurant with no 
trouble. I didn’t even need to 
read the sign out front. Almost 
invariably, in these small villages, 
the restaurant is in a two-story 
building. The proprietor lives up- 
stairs, and the downstairs is one 



big room, usually with at least 
one side completely open. This 
one was located on a comer of 
two streets, and there were two 
sides open. I parked my scooter 
out front, ducked to get my six- 
foot-six frame under the bamboo 
ceiling and sat down at the near- 
est table. The chair was too small 
for me, and my feet stuck out on 
the other side of the table, but 
by now I was used to that. 

There was a hand-written menu 
on the table, much battered and 
spotted, but still readable. I spot- 
ted fried noodles on the menu 
and was about to order them 
when I checked the price and 
thought about my expense ac- 
count. A dish of fried noodles 
went for ten baht, which is about 
fifty cents U.S. But Triple-I 
knows it doesn’t cost much to 
live out in the boondocks, and 
my expense account goes down 
accordingly. They’re a very cost- 
conscious outfit. So I settled for 
fried rice, for only five baht. By 
comparison with prices in the 
States, I consider these prices 
quite reasonable. But I’ve been 
told that they were much lower 
yet back in the late Sixties, be- 
fore the Air Force moved into the 
Base at Korat and drove the 
prices up. 

nphe proprietor came up and 
-*■ spoke to me in broken Eng- 
lish. When I answered him in 



96 



GALAXY 



Thai, he just beamed. Thailand 
doesn’t have any colonial history, 
so most of the people are friendly 
to Westerners anyway. But they 
really go overboard for a Wes- 
terner who’s taken the trouble to 
learn their language. I know that 
some of our competitors, like 
Brainpower Unlimited, don’t be- 
lieve in giving language training 
to their fieldmen. They claim 
that the time lost in retraining a 
man every time he moves to an- 
other country costs more than 
an interpreter. They may well 
be right. In this business, you 
have to be very cost-conscious. 
But Triple-I is as cost-conscious 
as the rest of them, if not more 
so, and still insists on language 
training. I’m in full agreement 
Things go much more smoothly 
if you don’t have to work through 
an interpreter. And I think it 
pays off for Triple-I, too. On the 
average, our fieldmen locate half 
again as many recruits as our 
competition. 

While I waited for my rice, I 
pulled out the photocopies I’d 
made of the school records in 
Non Tai. Here again, I felt, was 
one more advantage of not hav- 
ing to use an interpreter. I could 
read Thai well enough to search 
the records in the branch office 
of the Ministry of Education by 
myself. And instead of just look- 
ing for grades, I could base my 
judgments on the other informa- 

BRAIN DRAIN 



tion I found in the files as well. 

According to what I’d found, 
Manob Suravit, who was in his 
last year at the Song Hong high! 
school, was a very hot prospect. 
It wasn’t just his grades, which! 
were good but not all that out- 
standing. It was the whole pat- 
tern of his activities which caught 
my eye. I couldn’t tell you what 
made him stand out from the 
others, but I’ve found that since 
coming to work for Triple-I, I’ve 
developed a sort of sixth sense 
that’s rarely wrong in judging 
students. 

My meal finally came, a big 
platter of fried rice, covered with 
onion greens, and accompanied 
by a pot of hot black tea. I put 
Manob’s records back in my 
pocket and looked around me. I 
suddenly noticed that I was sur- 
rounded by a ring of small chil- 
dren, all staring solemnly at me. 

By now I was used to this sort 
of thing, though. They don’t often 
see Westerners, and the white 
skin fascinates them. (A "iatang," 
incidentally, is a Thai fruit with 
a white interior pulp.) And 
watching a Westerner eat is even 
more fascinating. But I figured 
I’d fool them. By now I could 
eat with chopsticks as well as 
with fork and spoon. I pulled the 
plate to me, pushed aside the 
onions (no sense risking a diges- 
tive disturbance from uncooked 
vegetables), and put some hot 

97 



sauce on the rice. That got an- 
other smile out of the proprietor. 
The Thais are very fond of hot 
sauces, but most Westerners 
never get past the burning and 
crying stage. Then I picked up 
my chopsticks and set to work. 
That ring of dark brown eyes 
followed my every move. Finally 
one of the kids spoke up. 

“ Farang come two days ago. 
You know him?” 

II 

T dropped my chopsticks. A 
Westerner here recently? 
Someone from Brainpower? Or 
one of the other outfits? I asked 
him for more information, but he 
couldn’t give any. Nor could the 
proprietor. I learned only that 
two days ago a farang had come 
through the village, talked to a 
few people, eaten at the restau- 
rant, and gone. Was he accom- 
panied by an interpreter? No, he 
wasn’t. That was some help, but 
not much. There was nothing to 
stop Brainpower, or any other of 
the outfits, from hiring someone 
who already knew Thai. Just as 
Triple-I had hired me, in part, 
because I’d learned Swahili in 
the Special Forces. 

I started to get up, then sat 
back down. If Brainpower had 
already sewed up Manob, there 
was nothing I could do about it. 
And if they hadn’t, then there 



« 

was no point in getting excited. 
So I finished my meal without 
hurrying, even though I was nag- 
ged by the question of whether 
I’d made this trip in vain. 

I pulled out some money to 
pay the bill and left the proprie- 
tor as big a tip as I thought my 
expense account could afford. 
Then I checked with him to make 
sure I had the right directions to 
the school and set out again on 
my mission. 

The school, too, was complete- 
ly typical. The floor was up on 
stilts, so the kids could play un- 
der the building when it rained. 
The one floor held all the class- 
rooms, which were separated by 
partitions. 

All around the outside 
was a balcony and a railing. I 
went up the stairs and around the 
balcony to the schoolmaster’s of- 
fice. I ducked my head to get 
through the doorway and went 
in. The schoolmaster was at his 
desk. 

I put my hands with the palms 
together, fingers straight and 
held just under my chin, bobbed 
my head and said “Sawatdi,” 
which can best be translated as 
“Good luck to you” and is used 
for good morning, good evening, 
good-bye and just about every- 
thing else. The schoolmaster rose 
and returned my greeting. We ex- 
changed some pleasantries, and 
he complimented me on my Thai.

Then I pulled out my authori- 
zation from the Ministry of Edu- 
cation to do educational recruit- 
ing (in the trade we call it a 
“headhunting permit”) and I 
showed it to him. He froze up 
immediately. 

That surprised me. In Nigeria 
I was used to having the village 
Communist denounce me as an 
agent of imperialism. But in 
Thailand I very rarely met any- 
thing this unfriendly. But there 
was no help for it. I had to go 
ahead. 

“I would like to see Mr. Manob 
Suravit.” 

“He is not here.” That was 
chilling. Maybe Brainpower had 
been here before me. 

“Has he been recruited by 
someone else?” 

“I do not know.” 

“Where is he?” 

“I do not know.” 

Oh, he was a cool one, the 
schoolmaster was. He wasn’t go- 
ing to defy me, since I could com- 
plain to the Ministry of Educa- 
tion and cause him a lot of trou- 
ble. But he wasn’t going to help 
me either. 

“I wish to inspect Mr. Manob’s 
records.” They would have to 
show whether he’d been recruited 
or not. 

“There is no one to help you 
find them.” 

“Help is not needed. I can read 
Thai.” 



nphat got him. He couldn’t re- 
fuse to let me look at the 
records. But they were no help, 
except to show that the boy had 
missed school three days in a 
row. But the additional informa- 
tion in them, which hadn’t been 
sent on to Non Tai, made me 
even more certain I wanted to 
sign him up. 

I turned back to the school- 
master. “Can you tell me where 
he lives?” 

“I do not know.” 

He was taking a risk with that 
statement. I felt sure he knew 
where one of his best students 
lived. If I could prove he was 
lying, I could put enough pres- 
sure on the Ministry to make him 
sorry for it But it wasn’t worth 
the trouble, and he probably 
knew that So I copied down the 
name of Manob’s father and took 
my leave of the schoolmaster. He 
didn’t reply to my polite farewell. 

I went back into Song Hong, 
to the police station, and inquired 
if they knew where Mr. Sakul 
Suravit lived. They searched the 
register and gave me directions. 
It was off the main cart track, 
a total of about five miles. Man- 
ob must have used a bicycle to 
get to and from school. It took 
me about an hour to find the 
place, and I nearly shook my 
teeth out on the last half mile of 
rough trail, before I got off my 
scooter and pushed it.

Finally I reached the Suravit 
home. It was a three-room 
thatched house, up on stilts, with 
some pigs and chickens under 
the house, avoiding the sun. 
There was a low fence around 
the house, probably to keep the 
chickens out of the fields. I 
wheeled my scooter through the 
gate and stopped. I didn’t have 
to wonder what to do next. A 
young man came down the ladder 
from the house and walked to 
meet me. I saw that he was wear- 
ing clean khaki shirt and pants, 
and a pair of Japanese rubber 
sandals. 

“ Sawatdi . I wish to see Mr. 
Manob Suravit” 

“Good afternoon, sir. I am 
Manob Suravit,” he answered in 
slightly accentd English. “What 
can I do for you?” 

“Is your father home, or your 
mother?” I asked. 

“My mother is sick, and I am 
staying home from school to care 
for the younger children while 
my father works in his fields. He 
is not here now, but will be home 
later.” 

“I would like to talk to them 
about you going to college, then 
working in America.” And I 
handed him my headhunting per- 
mit 

H e looked at the document, 
then nodded his head slowly. 
“The tarang who was here two 

100 



days ago had a paper like this 
one,” he said. “But he was from 
Brainpower Unlimited. He tried 
to get my father to sign his paper, 
but my father wanted to think 
about it. He told the man to 
come back the next day, but he 
did not. I have not seen him 
since.” 

“Do you still have his paper?” 

“He took it with him. However, 
I did read it, and I also read it 
to my father. My father went to 
school only two years, and does 
not read well. But,” he added 
proudly, “he is a very good farm- 
er and takes the advice of the 
man from the Ministry of Agri- 
culture.” 

“Very well,” I told him, “then 
you know what I want. When 
your father returns I will talk to 
him about signing my paper. But 
first I would like you to take 
some tests.” 

This was the key to whether I 
would offer to recruit him. 
Grades weren’t always reliable, 
since the quality of school sys- 
tems varied. And Triple-I wasn’t 
about to invest big money in 
someone just on the basis of my 
hunches about him. They insisted 
that he be given their tests, to 
determine his ability and poten- 
tial. So I unpacked my saddle- 
bags and brought out the test 
materials. 

Triple-I had spent a lot of 
money on the development of 

GALAXY 



these tests. They were so far be- 
yond the old IQ tests as to make 
comparisons ridiculous. They 
tested ability to learn, creativity, 
ability to make and use abstrac- 
tions, mechanical ability and all 
kinds of other things. And the 
beauty of it was that they were 
completely culture-free. They 
didn’t depend on reading skills 
peculiar to middle- class Ameri- 
can suburbia. I had used the 
same set of materials in Nigeria, 
and they would be equally use- 
ful in Westchester County or 
Harlem. 

The boy took three hours to 
finish, including a few interrup- 
tions to make some tea for his 
mother, to dust off a baby sister 
who’d fallen down, and a few 
other things. But when he was 
finished, I saw that my intuition 
had been right. He was one of 
the best I’d ever tested. He was 
no Einstein, but he was in the top 
one or two per cent of the human 
race. Triple-I just had to have 
him. We could get a placement 
bonus of at least fifteen thousand, 
over and above expenses, once 
his education was complete. 

J ust then the boy’s father ar- 
rived. I introduced myself, we 
chatted pleasantly for a while 
and then we got down to busi- 
ness. He suggested that we go in- 
side, so his wife could take part 
in the discussions too. So the 
BRAIN DRAIN 



three of us sat around a table, 
drinking tea. 

“Let me explain what I offer,” 
I started. “Your son is a very 
clever boy. He should go to the 
University after he has finished 
high school. We will pay his tui- 
tion and give him a living allow- 
ance while he is in school. He will 
go to Chulalongkom University, 
in Bangkok, until his education is 
completed. Then he will go to 
America. In America, he will 
make enough money to live well, 
and to pay us back for his educa- 
tion. And even to send some 
home to you.” I always added 
that last statement. It usually 
helped convince people, and in 
most cases the recruits actually 
did send remittances home. 

The mother spoke up quickly. 
“But that means he will go away 
from our home. We will not see 
him.” From her standpoint, this 
was a strong objection. Thai 
family bonds are strong. 

“At first he will not go far,” 1 
answered. “He will go to Chula- 
longkom for seven years. That is 
only a few hours ride by train 
from Korat. On holidays he can 
come home to see you.” 

“The train costs money,” the 
father objected. 

“True,” I replied, “but the liv- 
ing allowance we give him will 
include enough money for train 
fares.” That was strictly true, but 
since the boy would have to pay 

101 



back every penny of it, with in- 
terest, it was our experience that 
he would make fewer and fewer 
visits jbome as time went on. 

“ffcit then he will go to Amer- 
ica. That is too far away,” the 
mother interjected. 

“Even when he goes to Amer- 
ica,” I continued, “any time he 
wants to, he can fly back to Don 
Muang Airport, at Bangkok, and 
then take the train to see you.” 
That, too, was strictly true. He 
would have just as much oppor- 
tunity to travel as any other 
American citizen. But even tour- 
ist class fares on the Jumbo jets 
were enough to discourage his 
coming home very often. But I 
saw no point in mentioning that. 

“But I need the boy to help 
me in the fields after he finishes 
high school,” the father added. 
“I have other children to feed and 
to buy clothes for. If he goes 
there will be no one to help me.” 
“Surely,” I said, as smoothly 
as I could, “you wouldn’t let that 
stand in the way of your boy get- 
ting an education and bettering 
himself.” 

“Of course not,” the father re- 
plied. “What kind of a father do 
you think I am? It is just that I 
will have to hire a man to help 
me if he goes.” 

W ell, I thought, now we know 
what kind of a father you 
are. We’re just haggling over the 
102 



price. “How much will a hired 
man cost?” 

“About two hundred baht a 
month.” 

I thought for a moment. Ac- 
cording to what I had read, that 
was a bit high for the price of 
farm labor, but not much. It 
came to about ten dollars a 
month, US currency. “That is for 
a fully experienced' farmer. To 
hire a boy about your son’s age 
will cost only about one hundred 
fifty baht a month. And how 
many years will you need to keep 
hiring someone?” 

“My youngest daughter is five. 
I will need to hire farm help un- 
til she has finished school.” 

That was robbery, and I wasn’t 
about to hold still for it. “Does 
Manob have an older brother?” 
I knew he did, from the school 
records. 

“Yes, he does.” 

“Where is he?” 

“He lives with his wife, on the 
other side of Song Hong.” 

“How old was he when he was 
married?” 

“He was twenty two.” That 
checked with the records the po- 
lice had shown me. 

“Very well, I offer to pay you 
one hundred fifty baht a month, 
to hire a man to take Manob’s 
place, until Manob is twenty 
two.” 

“Manob will need clothes to 
go away to school,” the mother 

GALAXY 



spoke up. “He cannot wear the 
clothes he has now.” 

“Yes,” the father added, “the 
other man offered us two thou- 
sand baht to buy clothes for Man- 
ob.” 

I had wondered how soon I’d 
have to start outbidding Brain- 
power. Apparently the business 
of hiring a helper was something 
the father thought of only after 
the Brainpower field man had 
left. I decided to be a bit stub- 
born, just to let them know I 
wasn’t getting involved in an 
auction with Brainpower. 

“The other man did not come 
back, did he? Perhaps you would 
rather wait for him and his two 
thousand baht?” Actually, that 
was almost pure bluff. I had no 
intention of walking out of there 
without a signed contract, if I 
could possibly help it, no matter 
what I had to offer. However, it 
worked. 

“Well, perhaps he could get by 
on fewer clothes. How about one 
thousand baht?” That from the 
boy’s father. 

“No. I will not go above five 
hundred baht.” Now that I had 
the boy’s father on the non, I was 
going to keep him that way if I 
could. 

XITe haggled some more, about 
’ ’ the living allowance, train 
fares, postage for letters home 
and lots of other things. Thais 

BRAIN DRAIN 



learn to haggle shortly after they 
learn to talk, and they love to 
do it. 

After about an hour we ran out 
of things to haggle about. 

“Very well,” I said, “are we 
agreed on these terms?” Manob 
read back to his father what I’d 
written into the contract Both 
the parents finally agreed to 
every word. 

“Fine. Now here is the con- 
tract. You, as the boy’s father, 
sign here. The boy will sign over 
here.” 

After that, I left as soon as I 
could, with my copy of the con- 
tract safely in my pocket. I’d 
have to go by the school, to enter 
the contract on the boy’s records. 
Then I’d have to get back to Non 
Tai as quickly as possible and 
register the contract with the 
Ministry of Education. Then I’d 
mail the contract back to the 
home office and get busy track- 
ing down some more prospects. 
I walked the scooter beck to- 
wards the main road until the 
track was smooth enough to con- 
sider riding on. By then the sun 
was almost setting, so I hurried 
as fast as I could. It looked as 
though I’d have to spend the 
night in Song Hong. 

I rode through a grove of trees 
at near top speed. There were 
long shadows across the road, and 
I didn’t see the wire until just 
before I hit it.

Ill 



A 

Tf I had been just a few inches 
-*■ shorter, it would have broken 
my neck. As it was, it caught me 
high on my chest and spilled me 
off my scooter. I relaxed as I 
went over the back of the saddle, 
and while the fall knocked the 
wind out of me, nothing got brok- 
en. I lay there in the road on my 
back, a ring of pain around me 
just below my ribs. I tried to 
breathe in. Nothing. I tried to 
cough. Again nothing. I tried to 
squeeze my chest. Still nothing. 
Out of the comer of my eye I 
saw half a dozen men, waving 
clubs, run out of the trees. I 
heaved myself up on my elbows 
and worked my feet around 
towards them. Again I tried to 
suck in some air, and with the 
feeling that I’d broken through 
some kind of barrier, my chest 
muscles started working again. I 
coughed and sucked in another 
lungful. 

I craned my head up and took 
a look at the cluster of men 
standing a few feet away. They 
looked like big, husky farm boys. 
Probably the biggest in the vil- 
lage. If I had been standing up, 
the tallest might have come to my 
shoulder. But although they were 
tough-looking, they didn’t seem 
to know how to work together. 

Now that I could breathe again, 
I wasn’t worried. I hadn’t spent 

104 



five years in the Special Forces 
without learning how to take care 
of myself. As long as I could 
take them on one at a time, I 
figured I’d come out on top. 

They started to move up to 
me. I raised my knees slightly, 
and drew my feet back. As one of 
them came closer, I hooked my 
left foot behind his right leg. I 
slammed his right knee with the 
heel of my boot. But not too hard. 
I wasn’t interested in doing him 
any permanent damage. I just 
wanted him out of the fight for 
a while. He went over backwards, 
and I rolled aside to avoid a 
kick from another one of them. 
I bounced to my feet and scooped 
up the club my first victim had 
dropped. As one ran behind me 
I stepped forward, swung at an- 
other to discourage him from get- 
ting too close and turned around. 
The one who’d been behind me 
swung his club, but I was out of 
range. I stepped in and gave him 
a backhand swipe with my club 
as he went by. Two down. I turn- 
ed again, and the rest started to 
circle around me. I stepped to- 
ward one of them. He swung 
while I was still out of reach, 
then turned and ran. The other 
four followed him into the trees. 

I didn’t follow them. Twilight 
in the tropics is very short, and 
in a few minutes it was going to 
be pitch black. Besides, I had 
nothing to gain from either beat- 

GALAXY 



ing them up or turning them in. 

I righted my scooter, then stood 
and thought for a minute. Finally 
it hit me. 

The schoolmaster. This had to 
be his work. No one else knew 
for sure where I was except the 
police, and they wouldn’t have to 
go to this kind of subterfuge if 
they wanted to get rid of me. And 
it explained why the man from 
Brainpower hadn’t come back. 
He’d been scared off, or perhaps 
killed. Maybe I ought to be 
grateful to the schoolmaster for 
driving him off, so Triple-I could 
sew up Manob, but I didn’t think 
it was a good idea to encourage 
attacks on fieldmen. 

So I had a couple of score to 
settle with the schoolmaster. 

IT e was still in his office, which 
was the only lighted room in 
the school building. I didn’t wor- 
ry about him having anyone else 
around there. He was probably 
expecting his bully-boys to come 
back for their payoff, and he 
certainly wouldn’t want any wit- 
nesses to that. 

I stepped into his office and 
greeted him politely. “Sawatdi,” 
I said. “I met some friends of 
yours on the way over here, and 
I thought you’d like to know 
what happened to them. Two of 
them were still lying in the road 
when I left, and the rest were 
running into the woods.” 

BRAIN DRAIN 



He remained seated at his desk 
and stared at me with hate-filled 
eyes. Finally he spoke. “The other 
man was smart enough not to 
come back. If you come back 
again I will see that you don’t 
leave, if I have to kill you my- 
self.” 

I sat down and spoke as mild- 
ly as I could. “I’m glad to hear 
the man representing Brainpower 
Unlimited was not killed. If he 
had been, I would not rest until 
the Thai courts punished you for 
it. But since he’s still alive, he 
can take whatever action he wish- 
es to. Since I hurt your men 
worse than they hurt me, I bear 
no grudges. But would you mind 
telling me why you did it?” 

“You are leeches,” he grated 
out. “With this brain drain, you 
take away our brightest young 
people, the ones we need most 
for our future leaders.” 

“But,” I replied, “the Ministry 
of Education has approved our 
work. Do you think they would 
approve something which was 
harmful to Thailand?” 

“Bah!” he snorted. “Thailand 
has had corrupt governments in 
the past. I would not find it hard 
to believe that you have corrupt- 
ed this one, too.” 

“All right, so approval by the 
Ministry doesn’t impress you. 
Then would you tell me specifi- 
cally who we’re hurting, and 
how?” 

105 



“You hurt the men and women 
themselves. You sell them into 
slavery.” 

“What do you mean, slavery? 
I don’t think the average scien- 
tist or doctor in America is living 
in slavery. All we do is lend our 
recruits enough money to pay for 
their education. We’re a private, 
profit-making corporation, and 
we expect them to pay us back. 
I don’t call that slavery, either.” 
“Bat it's not just the cost of his 
education that you make him pay 
back. He has living expenses to 
pay back, too. You allow him to 
live in a very high style, much 
better than he would live at 
home; to induce him to leave 
home. You bribe him. And you 
bribe bis parents, too, with all 
kinds of payments. And the worst 
of it is that he has to pay you 
back for the bribe money.” 

IV 

T leaned forward and stuck my 
finger out at him. “Now you 
just wait a minute. Let’s be real- 
istic. Take this young man, Man- 
ob. Could he have gone to college 
without our help?” 

“No, of course not. His parents 
cannot send him. He took the 
scholarship exams and did well, 
but not well enough. There are 
just not enough scholarships, 
even for those who are qualified.” 
“Right,” I said. “Without our 
106 



help, he’d spend the rest of his 
life on the farm. Now to complete 
his education, including living 
costs, tuition, and what we pay 
his parents, will amount to about 
five thousand dollars in US 
money. When he’s employed in 
America, he’ll make at least twice 
that much a year. Our contract 
calls for him to pay back the 
loan, with interest, over a period 
of ten years. It’ll cost him under 
a thousand a year, including in- 
terest charges. That’s less than 
ten per cent of his salary. That 
sure beats running a farm out 
here in the boondocks.” 

He was silent for a moment. 
Then he spoke again. “Very well. 
Perhaps the boy does benefit. But 
how about Thailand? You are 
stealing our educated young men 
and women, men and women we 
will need as our country develops. 
Every year Chulalongkom grad- 
uates a hundred Ph.D.’s. But 
only twenty-five of those stay in 
Thailand. The rest go to America. 
You are taking college graduates 
from a country which has few 
of them and sending them to a 
country which has many al- 
ready.” 

I leaned back and sighed. This 
man was a hard nut to crack. 
“Okay, let’s look at the facts. It’s 
true we have more Ph.D.’s per 
capita in the US than you do in 
Thailand. But we still don’t have 
enough to fill our demand. So 

GALAXY 



we import them from you. But 
you’re not losing anything in the 
process. Educating our recruits 
won’t cost Thailand a single baht. 
We pay Chulalongkom Universi- 
ty not only the normal tuition 
and 1 fees for the students we put 
through there, but the full audit- 
ed cost, plus a bonus. The Uni- 
versity actually makes a profit 
on the students we send through, 
a profit which they can use to 
help make up their losses on their 
regular students.” 

4 4Hphat may be true,” he an- 
swered, “but we still have 
to maintain a University big 
enough for one hundred graduate 
students, just to get twenty-five 
a year for ourselves.” 

“But you’ve missed the whole 
point,” I protested. “Because of 
the large number of students put 
through by the various headhunt- 
ing outfits, Chulalongkom can 
take advantage of economies of 
scale. Administrative overhead 
can be spread over more students. 
And since you need more faculty 
members anyway, they can afford 
to specialize. One professor can 
teach three sections of the same 
course, instead of teaching three 
different courses. You have a bet- 
ter faculty than you would in a 
smaller school, and the students 
you will employ domestically are 
getting a better education than 
they would in a small school.” 
BRAIN DRAIN 



The schoolmaster seemed to 
have calmed down somewhat. 
The hatred and anger were gone. 
He still wasn’t convinced, but he 
was arguing rationally. “Despite 
all you say,” he said, “these are 
still people we need in Thailand. 
And you’re taking them away.” 
“No, I disagree,” I replied. 
"You can’t say we’re taking peo- 
ple you need domestically. You’re 
already training as many Ph.D.’s 
for domestic use as you can find 
jobs for. Or if you’re not, the 
answer is to provide more schol- 
arships for deserving students. 
But don’t criticize us for import- 
ing into the US some Ph.D.’s who 
would have stayed on the farm 
if it hadn’t been for our help.” 
“Look,” I went on, “picture it 
this way. What’s the ideal indus- 
try for an underdeveloped coun- 
try? One which calls for high la- 
bor input, low capital input, and 
low land input, right?” 

He nodded, slowly. I could see 
I was finally getting through. 
“Well,” I added, “that describes 
a University perfectly. About 
80% of Chulalongkom’s costs are 
pay of faculty and staff. The 
capital investment per student is 
small, and no raw materials are 
required. Producing Ph.D.’s for 
export, if managed properly, can 
be a very profitable enterprise 
for an underdeveloped country. 
And I think your Ministry of 
Education is seeing that it’s man- 

107 



aged properly. You don’t object 
to the export of oranges, or of 
corn. Both are big moneymakers 
for Thailand. Why do you object 
to raising Ph.D.’s for export?” 
The schoolmaster answered me 
in an almost friendly tone. “You 
have pointed to the big problem,” 
he said. “If we export oranges, 
the tree is sitill here to grow more. 
If we export com, we keep some 
seed com for the next crop. But 
men and women capable of earn- 
ing Ph.D.’s are not grown like 
oranges or com. They happen by 
chance. And' when we export 
them to America, their children 
are bom in America. Exporting 
Ph.D.’s lowers the average in- 
telligence of the next generation.” 

T replied slowly. “What you say 
-*• is true, as far as it goes. How- 
ever, look at the numbers. In 
Thailand this year there are 
about 800,000 eighteen-year-olds. 
We are interested in the top ten 
per cent of these, or about 80,000. 
Of these, we take less than a hun- 
dred. You lose more than that 
to fatal diseases and accidents. 
The genetic damage we do to 
Thailand by importing Ph.D.’s 
from you is negligible. And if you 
were really worried about it, you 
could make up for it by provid- 
ing some incentives for your do- 
mestically employed Ph.D.’s to 
have more children.” 

“I have to admit the force of 
108 



your arguments,” he finally an- 
swered. “Neither your recruits, 
nor Thailand, is hurt by your im- 
porting of Ph.D.’s. But why 
should we help you?” 

“Why, you benefit economical- 
ly. The benefits are already con- 
siderable. And the projections of 
the Ministry of Education show 
that in a decade, the export of 
Ph.D.’s will be your sixth largest 
source of foreign exchange. You 
ought to be cooperating with the 
program, instead of fighting it.” 
He looked thoughtful. “You 
are right,” he said. “I’ve been 
making a mistake. I’ll keep you 
in mind as a source of scholar- 
ships for my bright students who 
can’t find a way to go to college.” 
“Fine,” I said. “And we’ll even 
give you a bonus for every recruit 
you get for us. And don’t worry 
about it costing the student any- 
thing,” I added as his face started 
to cloud up. “It will cost the 
student less than if we’d had to 
go to the usual expense of having 
a fieldman recruit him. You’ll be 
doing a favor to all concerned, 
including yourself. Now if you’ll 
excuse me,” I said as I stood up, 
“I must find a place to stay to- 
night. I have a long way to go 
tomorrow, and more work to do.” 
He stood up and returned my 
farewell with a vigorous nod of 
his head. I left him sitting at his 
desk, wearing a smile on his face. 

— JOSEPH P. MARTINO 
GALAXY 




T ate in the afternoon of an ugly 
' * fall day, a forty-year-old top- 
ologist, employed to teach math- 
ematics at a university he des- 
pised, bored by his students and 
frightened that he had done 
everything of significance in his 
life that he would ever do, blun- 
dered head down into a group 
of students handing out flowers 
and handbills. Before he could 
retrieve his dropped book bag 
and move on to continue com- 
posing in his head a memorable 
letter of resignation, his eye had 
fallen on a grubby teenage girl, 
and he was hopelessly entrapped. 

Thinking to break the spell, he 
boldly said to her, “Aren’t you 



in my class in elementary top- 
ology?” 

She licked the raspberry snow 
cone she was holding and said, 
without a trace of a smile, “You 
must be mad. I’m not a student, 
just a wandering Gypsy fortune- 
teller.” She held out the snow 
cone for him to take a lick. “Do 
you have a place where we could 
go, and I would tell your for- 
tune?” 

The mathematician knew she 
was no Gypsy, for your modern, 
urban Romany never allow them- 
selves to be as dirty as she was. 
He was certain she was putting 
him on, but his mood of desper- 
ate boredom was such that he 



109 




said, “Cra-a-a-zy, Gypsy! Fall 
up to my pad, and we’ll tell for- 
tunes and other lies ’til the world 
melts.” 

They left hand in hand under 
the eyes of forty witnesses. With- 
in their own sub-culture, however, 
the rebel students conformed to 
a rigid code; and they would 
have died rather than give infor- 
mation to the fuzz or even to the 
Dean of the Faculty; so the pro- 
fessor’s absolute breach of pro- 
priety in picking up a student 
went unremarked and unreport- 
ed. 

When he had taken off her 
clothes, the girl was every bit as 
dirty as she appeared to be, but 
this only made him more de- 
termined to take advantage of 
her. Later, he persuaded her to 
shower by promising to bathe 
with her; and she looked, when 
she left, with her rum-colored 
hair in two long plaits, like a 
fresh-scrubbed Girl Scout. 

The crust turned out to be her 
equivalent of the make-up that 
squares use; when he came past 
the common the next day, she 
was as delectably grimy as ever, 
and she held a fresh snow cone 
purple with grape syrup. 

The two joined hands and went 
directly to his apartment. The 
young woman hardly spoke until 
late in the evening, after they 
had showered together. She was 
towelling her hair, and the infor- 
110 



mation came indistinctly. “I went 
to the Provost’s office today,” 
she said, “and told him about us.” 

Hphe professor was so uncharac- 
J teristically content he con- 
templated the ruin of his academ- 
ic career with pleasure. “All right, 
big mouth, how are we going to 
live?” 

“I’m not really a Gypsy,” she 
said, “but I really was in a car- 
nival once, when I ran away be- 
fore. I know how to dodge swords 
in a sword basket. Could you be 
an East Indian sword magician? 
We could pick up a show some- 
where and travel right along with 
them.” 

“By God,” cried the topologist. 
“I can do better than that! It’s 
been a long time since I did any 
engineering work, but I have a 
little laboratory curiosity that will 
just fill the bill. Come with me 
to the animal house in the base- 
ment of the Psychology Depart- 
ment, and I’ll show you some- 
thing you won’t believe.” 

“Try me, baby,” replied his 
inamorata. “You’d be surprised 
at what I can believe.” 

They repaired to the noisome 
cages in which the experimental 
animals were kept, and the pro- 
fessor secured a sturdy mouse. 
Selecting a few strips of clear 
plastic from a rack, he lit a 
burner and uncorked a container 
of plastic adhesive. In a few min- 

GALAXY 



utes, the topologist had cobbled 
up a container which defied the 
eye to define its exact shape, but 
which most often seemed to be 
a lumpy cylinder. In a trice, he 
thrust the mouse in and clapped 
the square top down. The mouse 
could be seen through the plastic, 
but he seemed to be in a single 
fixed position, floating in midair 
with his paws and tail extended 
just as when he was inserted. 

Heating a pointed rod, the pro- 
fessor pierced a hole first in one 
side of the bulgy cylinder, and 
then in the other. In a moment, 
when the long pin had cooled, he 
introduced its sharp point 
through the hole again, and hav-, 
ing located the mouse properly, 
skewered the rodent through the 
heart so that the point of the 
sharpened rod came out the sec- 
ond hole. Swinging the cylinder 
over the girl’s hand with a little 
shake, the professor deposited a 
tiny drop of bright arterial mouse 
blood on her wrist 

As She looked at the crimson 
drop, tears appeared, sparkling 
on her eyelids. “Big deal, big 
man,” she said. “Mouse murder. 
I don’t think a wild mouse would 
walk into that plastic pipe, do 
you?” 

C L T T eart of my heart,” he re- 
plied. “It’s not a pipe. It 
isn’t even a cylinder, and it cer- 
tainly isn’t a mousetrap. This is 
SWORD GAME 



a tesseract, as you would know 
if you had ever read a popular 
work on topology.” 

“Oh, all right, I know what a 
tesseract is: an expanded cube, 
a cube with a cube on each face. 
That mouse cage doesn’t look 
like six cubes surrounding a cube 
to me.” 

“No, otherwise our mouse 
would be dead all over. This is 
a tesseract which is a temporal 
illusion.” 

“A temporal illusion!” 

“Yes, my dear,” he said, “a 
temporal illusion. Topology 
teaches us that mathematical 
properties can be quite indepen- 
dent of apparent shape. A circle 
is still a circle, even though it 
looks like a scalloped pie crust — 
as it may, if it is drawn on a 
wavy surface. This mouse cage 
is a cubed cube which is partly 
displaced along the dimension of 
time. That’s why it appears form- 
less and shifting. Here, feel it.” 

Sure enough, to the touch, it 
was solid enough: a cube with a 
cube on each face; but even when 
held in the hand and sensed by 
touch, the object still appeared 
to be a rippling cylinder, and the 
mouse still appeared to be stock 
still. 

“This mouse looks dead. 
Eccch!” she said. 

Deftly the topologist withdrew 
the tiny sword, pried off the top, 
and shook Mr. Mouse out in his 

111 



hand, where the charming little 
fellow at once sat up on his 
haunches and waved his fore- 
paws, as if demanding cheese. 

“How did you do that?” cried 
the girl. 

“Simply, really,” replied the 
thinker. “The exterior flickers in 
and out of this moment of time, 
because of the subtle twist I im- 
parted to the shape when I made 
it; but the inside is fixed in time, 
because much of the internal 
mass is stretched all the way 
around the very large but finite 
continuum of space and time 
which is our universe. This little 
rascal’s ‘time’ has passed so slow- 
ly that the powerful regenerative 
and repair processes of his body 
have worked as if instantaneous- 
ly, and the apparently mortal 
wound dealt him was no more 
than a pin prick. Do you think 
you could get into a large tesser- 
act like this one and let me run 
a rapier through you . knowing 
it would do you no harm?” 

She clapped her hands in 
pleasure. “Oh yes, lover! That’ll 
be so much more of a mind buster 
than some old wicker basket that 
everybody knows I dodge the 
sword in.” 

S o they hied themselves to a 
plastic supply house and 
thence to a dog-and-pony show 
that was in the neighborhood, 
and for a long time, every thing 
112 



went like a guided trip with Tim 
Leary. Audiences were transfixed 
by the girl’s beauty. She was 
considerably cleaner under the 
difficult circumstances of carnival 
trouping than she had been when 
soap and water were conveniently 
to be had, and when the topolog- 
ist drove a sharpened fencing 
foil through her lovely body, clad 
as lightly as local ordinance al- 
lowed, the crowds gasped. When 
the box was rotated to show the 
point of the sword encamadined, 
strong men fainted. Later they 
would press forward and pay a 
dollar apiece to examine the tiny 
wound as it closed up and dis- 
appeared, usually midway up her 
delightfully articulated rib cage. 

Trouping the carnival together 
was an idyll. Still, even if forty 
years is not old, neither is it 
young; and the doctor of mathe- 
matics at last realized that he 
was bored again. The girl’s vo- 
cabulary never enlarged itself 
appreciably, and the snow cone 
remained her favorite confection. 
The difference in their ages was 
sufficient for their basic sex at- 
titudes to be irreconcilable. For 
him, a certain overtone of the 
forbidden gave carnal love its 
highest stimulation; but for her, 
sex was just another natural 
function, like perspiring or ex- 
creting, so that the level of their 
love-making remained at mere 
technical proficiency. 



GALAXY 



After the fashion her genera- 
tion had adopted, she was faith- 
ful. There might be others later, 
her manner implied by its play- 
fulness; but for now, she did not 
share her favors out. He was 
denied even the sour spice of 
jealousy. 

At the end of their last ap- 
pearance each evening, she was 
often wearing only transparent 
pantaloons and a shiny little 
brief, and when they had walked 
back to their quarters, she would 
hold up her arms and, stamping 
her naked feet softly like a har- 
em dancer, say, “Help me get 
ready for my bath, lover.” If he 
approached and began to roll 
down the waist band of her sa- 
teen pants, she would drop her 
arms and begin to undress him 
too. Later they would bathe each 
other. 

They had almost no other con- 
versation. 

\ t last the idyll became an en- 
-**■ slavement to the professor. 
He found some respite when he 
learned that a Hindu torture- 
man, their neighbor in the show, 
who slept on nails, poured boiling 
lead in his eyes, and so on, was 
a Failed M.A. in Mathematics 
from the University of Rawal- 
pundi. By talking to him, the top- 
ologist was able to keep from go- 
ing quite mad. Still, he was a 
little off. He loathed the girl and 
SWORD GAME 



dreamed only of what he would 
do when she left him; but she 
would not leave and continued 
to raise her arms to him and 
stamp her feet, as exquisitely ir- 
ritating as a kitten which contin- 
ues to claw one’s sock after one 
has done playing with it. 

He began to do everything bad- 
ly, even their turn in the show, 
which had never much interested 
him after he put the big tesseract 
together. Once he missed the hole 
with his thrust, and the plastic 
deflected the point of the foil in- 
to his toe. This was a real wound, 
in real time, not spread along the 
space-time continuum, and was 
extremely painful for a week. 
Each time he limped, the pain 
made him more resolved to be 
quit of her, until at last his fertile 
topological mind saw the way. 

He had a regular armorer’s 
store of swords with which he 
made play in their act, and one 
evening he laid handy, next to 
their bed, a very passable imita- 
tion of a Roman short sword. In 
its day, that design had been a 
great technological breakthrough 
for the weapons makers, and it 
was beautifully shaped to de- 
structive stabbing. 

When they came in that night, 
he skimmed off her tawdry cape 
with a flourish, and as she lifted 
her round arms and stamped one 
foot, he peeled the bottom of her 
costume off in one extravagant 

113 



gesture, and then gave her the 
pleasure of chasing him and tear- 
ing off his garments. As they were 
towelling each other after their 
ritual coupling and bathing, he 
kissed her, tender but preoccu- 
pied, as it were, and said, “My 
dear, would you mind letting me 
practice that last pass in the act? 
I just don’t seem to be putting 
that foil home right.” 

Qhe was so pleased to have him 
^ pleasant again that she scamp- 
ered into the spare tesseract they 
had in the quarters, a few drops 
from the bath still glistening on 
one flank. She turned her face up 
to him with a grin that almost 
made him reconsider the irrevers- 
ible act he had planned. Then he 
remembered the months of bore- 
dom and hardened his heart. De- 
cisively, he tapped the top home. 
Without a tremor, he put the 
Roman sword as nearly into her 
heart as he could judge its loca- 
tion through the subtle time shift- 
ing in the plastic. With that, he 
snapped off the blade, so that the 
sword also was within the spread, 
slowed effect of the moving time 
field; and gave the construction 
a knowledgeable kick or two 
which caused it to collapse into 
itself. Instead of a knobby cylin- 
der, as it had appeared when it 
was an expanded cube blurred 
by time, it now appeared to be a 
single cube about six inches on 
114 



a side, with an abstract pattern 
in each face. 

The collapsed cube was much 
heavier than it looked, but not 
nearly as heavy as the girl, for 
a substantial part of her mass 
was distributed along the whole 
of the cylindri-co-spherical space- 
time continuum. As he gazed at 
the mirror-like surface of one 
square face, an eye and eyebrow 
slowly spread flatly across the 
plane; but there was neither panic 
nor recognition in the eye as he 
stared into it. He realized that to 
the occupant of this peculiar box, 
his movements were so fast in ap- 
pearance as to be a mere blur. 
Whistling, the professor packed 
the weighty cube into his bag, 
and strolled off the lot, casually 
remarking to his Hindu neighbor, 
“So long, we’re jumping this flea 
circus.” 

By changing into one of his old 
natural shoulder suits at the bus 
station, he simply disappeared as 
Grax, the Swordsman of Time 
(his carnival billing), and rein- 
carnated himself as a topologist 
of considerable talent who had 
been vaguely on sabbatical for a 
while. 

nphe frustrations that had so 
nearly consumed him before 
his adventure seemed to have 
been burned and purged away. 
He settled with pleasure into a 
new academic routine and be- 

GALAXY 



came expert in its execution. 
Once in five years, perhaps, he 
had a really promising student; 
but the scarcity no longer both- 
ered him. As he advanced up the 
ladder of academic tenure and 
preferment, he was able to place 
a few brilliant people about him- 
self, and life was as good, he now 
knew, as it was ever going to be. 

The heavy cube was a paper- 
weight on the desk in his apart- 
ment. No one else ever recog- 
nized the shifting abstract pat- 
terns in its silvery sides as the 
topologized contours of a dead 
human being. At great intervals, 
there would drift across one face 
or another of the prism some 
recognizable anatomical feature 
with which the professor was in- 
timately acquainted, and he 
would feel a vague regret for his 
act and a light stirring, as of the 
ashes in a cold grate, of his ap- 
petite for the one adventure of 
his life. He would stuff his pipe, 
turn the pages of the Journal of 
Topology and immerse himself 
once more in the calm, sweet 
life of the university. 

When he was sixty years old 
and almost bald, there appeared 
in his classes the student of his 
dreams, who understood every- 
thing he said in his arcane spe- 
cialty and replied with fresh and 
elegant insights into the intuitive 
sort of math in which they both 
delighted. Objectively, he knew 
SWORD GAME 



the boy was neat and trim rather 
than handsome, yet subjectively 
(and privately, of course: he was 
very proper now), he always felt 
the boy was “good looking.” This 
feeling puzzled him until one day 
he had to move a stack of old 
college annuals and, browsing, as 
one will, he suddenly came on his 
own senior picture. His best stu- 
dent was enough like his youthful 
self to be a double, or at least a 
younger brother. 

Qhortly after that, the professor 
^ confided the story of his esca- 
pade to the boy. He could not 
have said why he did so, and it 
certainly was not wise; but the 
student was beginning to betray 
the same weird talent the pro- 
fessor had for translating topolo- 
gical abstractions into hardware 
that did peculiar things; and 
somehow the tale just told itself. 
He had become very fond indeed 
of his disciple. The boy, who af- 
fected the total amorality which 
was the fashion of his generation, 
was nevertheless shocked; but he 
was also intrigued. He picked up 
the box and shook it. “Maybe 
she’s alive,” he said. “After all, 
inside it’s only been an instant. 
Let’s unlock it.” 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” the pro- 
fessor said, taking the cube back 
and setting it on his desk in a 
definite manner. “In the first 
place, she’s not alive. While die’s 

115 



in the construction, there’s no 
evidence of the crime. Second, 
if she were alive, she might go 
to the ix) lice; or worse yet, she 
might expect me to take up that 
dreadful, boring liaison with her 
again. And in the third place, we 
can’t unlock it. That was the 
whole point of breaking the 
sword. The cube’s a closed sys- 
tem now, and no part of the in- 
terior is available to this aspect 
of time and space. Eventually 
she’ll be equally distributed 
through the entire universe. Ab- 
solutely not! I forbid you to think 
about it. When are you going to 
give me that paper on topologi- 
cal re-intervertebrates?” 
Conversation languished, and 
the student shortly took his leave. 
A day or two later, the professor 
found the boy fiddling the edges 
of the cube with a device made 
of mirrors, and they had a gen- 
uine quarrel, but gradually fell 
back almost into their former 
sympathetic teacher-student rela- 
tion. 

/"\ne day the student appeared 
^ in the professor’s apartment 
with a tiny glittering piece of 
metal in his hand, the shape of 
which was extraordinarily hard to 
see. The whole thing seemed to 
flicker in and out of the mathe- 
matician’s sight. “What the hell 
have you got there?” he asked 
the boy in irritation. 

• 116 



“It’s a chrome-plated, self- 
powered, retractable, inverted, 
universally jointed and fully 
gurgitated mobius strip,” the 
young man said. 

The professor laughed. Every 
schoolboy knows a mobius strip 
is a band' one end of which has 
been given a half twist before 
joining it to the other to make 
a circlet. The consequence of that 
little twist (try it) is that the 
mobius strip is a geometric figure 
which has only one side and one 
edge; though common sense, 
looking at it, can plainly discern 
two sides and two edges. How- 
ever, a pencil drawn down the 
center of “one side” will meet its 
own mark and there will then 
be seen to be a line drawn on 
“both sides” . because there is 
only one side, you see? 

But every schoolboy knows 
that’s all a mobius strip is: just a 
curiosity. Anything else you do 
to it changes it from being a mo- 
bius strip. So it can’t be improved 
by chroming it or powering it or 
anything else. The professor 
pointed all this out to his student 
in a rather overbearing manner. 
He finished by saying, “And I 
suppose you’re going to tell me 
it has some practical application.” 

“Yes,” said the boy, “it has.” 
And before the professor could 
stop him, he had reached across 
the desk, penetrated into the 
shiny cube with one half of the 

GALAXY 



glittering mobius strip and fished 
out the shattered remnant of a 
short Roman stabbing sword. 

In an instant, the old familiar 
bulgy cylinder was present on 
the desk, full size, and in another, 
a completely naked young wom- 
an had leaped out of it onto 
the floor. In stupefacation, the 
professor saw a pink, three-corn- 
ered scar, obviously just healing, 
on her rib cage, and noticed there 
were still drops of water glisten- 
ing on her flank. 

“Sweetheart!” she cried, “what 
was that butcher knife? I had to 
dodge like crazy!” And she en- 
gulfed the student in a squid- 
like embrace. A moment later she 
saw the professor and recoiled. 

“Who is this bald-headed old 
creep?” she said. “I draw the 
line at voyeurs, honey.” And with 
a wink and a nod, she and the 
student dumped the professor in- 



to the expanded cube and col- 
lapsed it about him. 

T7ven in the endless instant 
' which is the inside of his de- 
vice, time has begun to seem long 
to the topologist. He knows the 
girl and the student are long 
since dust in the whirling, kalei- 
doscopic world outside. He is be- 
ginning to be transparent, so he 
knows his substance is slowly 
plating out along the entire cy- 
lindrico-spherical space-time con- 
tinuum. He has realized that 
when he is fully distributed, the 
universe will be at an end; and 
he has composed a most astound- 
ing paper in his head explaining 
the whole phenomenon. His only 
regret is that he will never be 
able to send it to the Journal of 
Topology for publication.

THE 

DEVIL’S APPLES 

nphe scientific name of the po- 
tato plant is Solarium tuber- 
osum, and it is an entrenched 
opinion in Europe that the big- 
gest potatoes grow in the fields 
of the dumbest peasants. But if 
you want to quote this proverb 
within earshot of one of the afore- 
mentioned peasants you say that 
“the volume of the tubers of Sol- 



118 




anum tuberosum is inversely pro- 
portional to the intelligence of its 
producer.” 

The ordinary potato, like the 
sweet potato, is an American 
plant; and many years ago, in a 
description of Mexico, I read the 
statement that potatoes, when 
planted in Yucatan, begin to 
taste sweetish after the first gen- 
eration and have turned into 
sweet potatoes after the third 
generation. I don’t know who 
saddled the innocent visitor to 
Mexioo with that hoax. Factual- 
ly speaking the sweet potato is a 
member of the Convolvulus or 
morning glory family, while the 
ordinary potato is one of the 
nightshades. They are not at all 
related except that both are 
flowering plants. 

By now it must have become 
clear that this column is going to 
be about the potato, the lowly 
spud. That colloquial term, one 
can sometimes read, is supposed 
to have been derived from the 
initials of an anti-potato society 
said to have been in existence 
around the year 1880. The letters 
are supposed to stand for Society 
for the Prevention of Unwhole- 
some Diet. A nice story, but a 
“spud” actually is a special kind 
of narrow-bladed spade used for 
cutting roots — the name of the 
tool was transferred to what it 
brought to light. 

The early history of the potato 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



is fairly complicated, as will soon 
be seen; but let us dwell on the 
names of this useful vegetable for 
awhile. 

The potato had been “discov- 
ered” by the Spaniards in the 
realm of the Incas, where it went 
under the name of papa. The 
Spaniards could not adopt this 
name, which in their own lan- 
guage designates the pope. A trib- 
al dialect proved more useful by 
furnishing the word patata; we 
still use it in a little changed 
form. 

In Italy the new vegetable 
was called taratufllo or taratuf- 
foli; to the Frenchman Olivier de 
Serres this sounded clumsy, and 
he coined a French equivalent: 
cartoufle. However the French, 
when potatoes became common, 
used another name, pomme de 
terre, or “ earth apple." The Dutch 
adopted that name, in translation, 
of course, and called it Aardappel. 
The Germans, on the other hand, 
adopted the earlier French name, 
making it Kartollel, and the Rus- 
sians, who got their potatoes from 
Germany also took over the “Ger- 
man” name. The Hungarians 
seem to have imported their first 
potatoes from Burgandy because 
their word is still burgonya. 

'Tphe continent of origin of the 
cultivated potato is South 
America, specifically the West 
Coast of South America, and more 

119 



specifically the large island of 
Chiloe, located just off shore un- 
der 40° southern latitude. The 
outstanding expert on the history 
of cultivated plants, the late Pro- 
fessor Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov, 
considered the Chiloe strain to 
be the main ancestor of our po- 
tato for an interesting reason. The 
tropical versions, he said, were 
adapted to a climate where the 
length of the day does not vary 
much throughout the year. But 
Europe north of the Alps and 
Russia (and, of course, the United 
States north of 35° northern lati- 
tude) have long summer days. 
Under these conditions the tropi- 
cal South American forms fail to 
produce tubers. The Chiloe strain, 
however, was adapted to long 
summer days and became the 
most important for this reason. 

Potatoes reached Europe be- 
ginning about 1570, and older 
writers on cultivated plants in- 
variably assumed that they were 
brought in the familiar form of 
the tubers. More recently this 
assumption has been re-examined 
and proved wrong. The ships did 
not sail from, say, Antofagasta to 
Europe with a cargo of potatoes 
for the purpose of introducing 
the new plant. They sailed for 
many reasons, most of them lar- 
cenous by present-day standards, 
and they had no schedules. They 
stayed at sea for weeks at a time 
and then spent more weeks at 
120 



various stopover places, the whole 
voyage adding up to years. Po- 
tatoes, just dumped into barrels, 
simply do not last that long. In 
addition to the long travel times 
during which tubers would have 
rotted away or dried out, another 
factor speaks against the older 
assumption. Nobody then, from 
the simplest peasant to the most 
learned botanist-physician, had 
ever raised a plant from a piece 
of a tuber with an “eye” in it. 
Plants grew from seeds and some- 
times from a transplanted" root. 
Tubers were not known to these 
people; the only edible “under- 
ground” vegetables were beets 
and turnips, that had been plant- 
ed, and truffles, that just happen- 
ed without cultivation. 

In short: the potato must have 
traveled as seeds. 

Who carried those seeds? 

Since it is always easy to credit 
somebody whose name is famous 
for other reasons, Sir Walter Ra- 
leigh, Sir John Hawkins and Sir 
Francis Drake have all been hail- 
ed for the introduction of the po- 
tato. But the facts of history hap- 
pen to contradict. Sir Walter Ra- 
leigh could not have brought po- 
tatoes from Virginia in 1585 be- 
cause there were no potatoes in 
Virginia before 1700, or even 
later. And he never went to Peru 
where they were actually culti- 
vated in his time. 

As for Sir John Hawkins, it is 
GALAXY 



true that he brought something 
from America in 1565, but it was 
Ipomoea batatas, the sweet pota- 
to. Sir Francis Drake seems to 
have been credited just on prin- 
ciple; in Offenburg, southwest 
Germany, there even stands his 
statue with an inscription pro- 
claiming that he brought potatoes 
to Europe “in the Year of Our 
Lord 1580.” But there is no con- 
temporary record that he did. 
The ones who actually did are 
nameless, though it is certain that 



they were Spaniards, and it is 
likely that they were monks. And 
it may have been done because 
of suspected medicinal properties 
rather than because of the food 
value. 

Tt is known that Spaniards in 
what is now Colombia, Ecuador 
and Chile knew about potatoes 
around the middle of the six- 
teenth century but refused to eat 
them. On the other hand the place 
where potatoes were first eaten

in Europe was a hospital in Se- 
ville in 1573. That there was a 
medical aura around the new 
plant is shown by the fact that 
Philip II of Spain ordered pota- 
toes sent to him from Peru. After 
they had been harvested the king 
sent a number of tubers to the 
pope, and the pope passed them 
on to his ambassador to the Neth- 
erlands because he was sick. Some 
of them, in turn, were passed on 
to the Prefect of Mons, Philippe 
de Suvry, and he gave two to 
Jules Charles de l’Escluse (or 
Carolus Clusius, 1526-1609). Clu- 
sius received this gift because he 
was supervisor of the herb and 
flower gardens of Emperor Maxi- 
milian II of Austria. Clusius cul- 
tivated them in the Imperial Gar- 
dens of Vienna and Frankfurt am 
Main. Later, when he planned the 
Botanical Garden of Leyden 
(Holland), the potato took root 
there too, so that Clusius should 
be credited with the actual in- 
troduction of the potato in Con- 
tinental Europe. 

The main interest may have 
been medical, but the fact that 
the potato plant has very pretty 
flowers seems to have helped. Ru- 
dolph Jakob Camerarius, physi- 
cian and botanist, grew them in 
his garden at Numberg in 1588. 
Count von Helfenstein had pota- 
to plants in his garden in Silesia 
in 1595. The Landgrave of Hes- 
sen-Cassel cultivated them in 
122 



1590 and sent a bag of tubers to 
King Christian I of Saxony dur- 
ing the following year. That the 
pretty flower intrigued many is 
also shown by the fact that John 
Gerard of London had himself 
pictured on the title page of one 
of his works holding a potato 
flower. (Fig. 1.) 

John Gerard (1545-1607) was 
professionally what was then 
known as a “barber-surgeon,” but 
plants were his main interest. He 
had a famous garden himself and 
was also the supervisor of the

gardens of Lord Burleigh. His 
first literary work was a list and 
description of all the plants grow- 
ing in his own garden in Holborn; 
this was followed in 1597 by a 
much bigger work with the title, 
The Herball or Generali Historie 
of Plantes. It contains the first 
published picture of a potato 
plant. (Fig. 2.) 

nphis Herball, sad to relate, was 
not really John Gerard’s own 
work. It was a piece of literary 
shenanigans. A Dutchman, Rem- 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



bert Dodoens (Latinized as Do- 
donaeus, 1517-1585), who for a 
time had been court physician to 
Emperor Maximilian II, had 
written a book the medicinal 
“virtues” of plants that was pub- 
lished in 1554. It was written in 
Flemish, but Clusius immediately 
translated it into French as His- 
toire des plantes. This was fol- 
lowed by other plant books, and 
in 1563 the publisher van der Loe 
brought out a collection of Do- 
doens’s writings that became 
known as the Pemptade s. Then 

123 




the London publisher John Nor- 
ton requested a London physi- 
cian, Dr. Priest, to translate the 
Pemptade s into English, but Dr. 
Priest died before he finished his 
work. 

John Gerard said piously in the 
foreward to his Herball that Dr. 
Priest had started a translation, 
“but being prevented by death, 
his translation likewise perished.” 
Not so, barber-surgeon Gerard 1 

Actually Gerard had taken the 
translation, finished it, edited it 
and added a number of items. 
One of the added items was the 
picture of the potato plant. But 
as Gerard thought that it had 
come from Virginia, he named it 
accordingly. 

A much better description, and 
also a much better picture, was 
published in 1601 by Clusius 
(Fig. 3.) The book had the title 
RaiioTum Plantarum Historia — 
the history of rare plants. Actual- 
ly the potato was not rare any 
more in Europe at the time. Con- 
temporary chroniclers tell us that 
Silesian peasants made fires of 
straws and twigs and roasted the 
tubers in the ashes. But elsewhere 
in Europe the potato was suspect 
then and for many years to come. 
It had first been grown in herb 
gardens among many herbs 
known to be poisonous. It prob- 
ably was poisonous too, thought 
the suspicious Europeans, and be- 
sides there was a taint of magic

about something that grew under- 
ground. The peasants would have 
nothing to do with “the devil’s 
apples.” 

It needed a number of years 
with bad crops and famines (17- 
71-1774) to convince even the su- 
perstitious that these “apples” 
could be eaten without harm to 
body and soul. 

What could happen when you 
were dealing with a plant of

which the average man knew 
nothing is nicely illustrated by a 
story about the city councillors of 
Berlin. Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince 
of Brandenburg and known to his- 
tory as the Great Elector (1620- 
1688), had heard of the new veg- 
etable. There was a park in Ber- 
lin known as the Lust gar ten 
(pleasure garden), and in 1651 
he ordered the planting of pota- 
toes in it. When they were ready 
to be harvested he invited the city 
councillor^ to a meal; they were 
to tell him what they thought of 
potatoes. 

It is claimed that the cook who 
was to prepare the meal had 
never seen a potato plant before. 
He did not know about the tubers 

— or if he did he distrusted them 

— so he had the round green 
capsules containing the seeds 
picked for the meal. They felt 
pretty hard to him, so he sim- 
mered them for a long time with 
a pinch of salt. 

It so happens that the seed 
capsules have quite a bitter taste. 
The councillors took one bite and 
felt distressed. How could they 
thank their prince for this 
“treat”? 

Some reasoned that something 
might still have to be done, but 
additional salt and pepper only 



made it worse. Melted butter am- 
eliorated the situation to some 
extent — but not enough. Well, 
they had been asked to state their 
opinion, and this they had to do, 
even if the situation was unpleas- 
ant all around. They composed 
a careful document that began 
with an assertion of utmost loyal- 
ty and went on to say that none 
of those present had been pleased 
with the new vegetable. Its taste 
was bitter and tart, and it did not 
become palatable, not even when 
sugared. 

■fTThile the story of how the 
* ’ potato came to Europe is 
incomplete, the story of how it 
came to the United States is vir- 
tually nonexistent. The colonists 
in Virginia and Carolina may or 
may not have grown potatoes 
from seeds or tubers obtained 
from Spanish sea captains. The 
earliest authentic report from the 
United States says that potatoes 
were grown at Londonderry, N. 
H., in 1719, and that the plants 
had been brought over from Ire- 
land. 

And that's why the plant from 
the island of Chiloe off South 
America came to be called the 
Irish potato in North America.

in awhile, how often was that? 
The doctor he asked that ques- 
tion of shook his head. 

“No matter how long or how 



short a time you stay away, 
you’re going to run into diffi- 
culties,” he said. “You’ll be 
mighty uncomfortable on Earth 



TOUCH OF THE MOON 



127 



after living on Luna. Why not 
give it up, or else go back for 
good?” 

That was the problem, Earth 
or the Moon, you just couldn’t 
have both. 

“I got a girl there, that’s all,” 
said Martin. “She’s beautiful and 
good — ” 

“ — and can outwalk you and 
outrun you; hit harder than you 
and dance harder than you. 
You’re sagging; she’s bouncing. 
You’ve been outwitted by gravi- 
ty, son. Find yourself a Moon 
Maid.” 

Martin was anguished. He had 
a good job with the government 
on the Moon, and there were of- 
fice girls all around him who 
would jump at the chance to go 
with him anywhere. And when 
one uses the word jump, it is 
singularly appropriate. 

“We had a jumpin’ good time,” 
Martin’s office partner would say, 
for instance. “Mary and me.” On 
one particular occasion, he added 
casually, “By the way. I got a 
Mabel stacked away where I live 
who’s looking for a good-looking 
Geophile such as yourself. She’s 
homesick for stories about Earth. 
Why not give her a tumble?” 

Hard as it was for Martin to 
get Barbara off his mind, he did 
go dancing one night with Mabel 
and a bunch of other Slant-peo- 
ple. If you wonder about the 
term “Slant-people,” don’t. It’s 

128 



you and me when we’re on the 
Moon. On Earth when you walk 
you slant forward some but it’s 
not noticeable. On the Moon 
when you walk, it is: you slant 
forward a full thirty-five degrees. 
It’s a natural compensation for 
the low gravity. You unconscious- 
ly put yourself into a series of 
falling positions, much like the 
Moon itself as it falls around the 
Earth. That’s why dancing is 
popular on the Moon. You hold 
each other up, for the most part. 
People get tired of walking with 
their faces near the floor. 

Anyway, Mabel didn’t work 
out. She had a permanent crick 
in her neck from trying to keep 
her eyes level the five years she’d 
been here, and she was unable to 
dance in the vertical. This creat- 
ed' problems. He put pressure on 
the small of her back trying to 
force her to assume a better cen- 
ter of gravity, but she didn’t know 
what the problem was and 
couldn’t cooperate. He told her 
some stories about Earth, as it 
was three months ago when he 
left, but made it all so uninterest- 
ing, deliberately, that she decided 
to stay outside Earth the rest of 
her life like the medics told her 
she had to. 

A /fartin pursued his lonely 
-*-*-*■ course, every day going to 
the YMCA and vigorously per- 
forming his serious exercises. The 

GALAXY 



trouble was it was easy to chin 
yourself, so what were you gain- 
ing? You were exercising for the 
Moon’s gravity. There were, of 
course, machines which rotated 
you at one gee. They were not 
satisfactory, inasmuch as the cen- 
ter bar was only six feet away 
from his feet; simulated gravity 
fell off too fast. 

There were the sliding racks 
which whizzed you around the 
floor and the ceiling of the gym- 
nasium and pulled at you with 
one gee also. On these racks one 
could do regular sitting-up exer- 
cises and even lift weights. But 
it was hazardous considering that 
some of this was done upside- 
down. Besides, there were only 
two racks at the YMCA, and they 
were in demand. Other means of 
exercise included workouts from 
the masseurs, but one could not 
afford them all the time. 

Besides, it was all a very big 
bore. 

Martin went to his superior in 
cost-accounting and asked or 
begged for some kind of solution. 

“I’ve got this girl on Earth,” 
he began, “and she’s beautiful 
and good — ” 

“ — and can already outslug 
you,” said his superior in such a 
manner that Martin knew he had 
run into the oldest and corniest 
of Moon jokes: your Earth girl 
can wrap you into a pretzel and 
serve you with her beer. 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



“But I have to go back,” in- 
sisted Martin, “before it’s too 
late. I figure if you could let me 
have a month I could take a 
crash exercise course and build 
myself back up into the he-man 
I was. I think you understand 
the problem.” 

“I do indeed,” his superior said, 
shrugging. He opened the peri- 
scope on his desk, rotated the 
over-Moon viewer twenty de- 
grees and picked up Earth. 
“There it is,” he said, a note of 
sadness creeping into his voice. 
“I’ll never go there again, nor will 
my wife and children.” 

“You found it possible to give 
up Earth,” nodded Martin tragi- 
cally. 

“Had to, son. But my family 
stays with me wherever I go, so 
it isn’t too bad. Once a year I 
alternate jobs and go to Mars 
and spend a few months there. 
We run into old friends, scads of 
them, migrating back and forth 
for the same reason we do, to 
tone up our muscles and our 
nervous plexi with a shot of a 
heavier gravity, so we keep our 
Tarot packs hot. But my two 
boys — ” He chuckled, and ges- 
tured at Earth. 

“Look at it. There’s where my 
memories and all my nostalgias 
lie. But my two growing sons get 
the shivers from it, because it 
looks heavy. I don’t know wheth- 
er this is because they’ve been 

129 



studying Earth in school, or 
whether they know instinctively 
they aren’t built to live there. 
Such is life. 

“As for your request,” he said, 
opening the drawer in front of 
him and extracting some forms, 
“it’s a fairly common one. Take 
a month — take six weeks, if 
you want. Maybe you can talk 
your girl into taking the Govern- 
ment tests and get her on the 
Moon. That’s about the only 
solution I can see, unless you de- 
cide to do it the hard way and 
stay on Earth, which would be 
a pity. However, maybe you’ll 
decide your girl isn’t worth the 
sacrifice.” 

“Oh, she’s worth it, sir. She’s 
really worth any sacrifice. She’s 
beautiful and high-principled — 
and good. And,” he added, 
straignt-faced, “she can probably 
already outslug me.” 

M artin took the shuttle out of 
Luna City two days later. 
He took all his possessions with 
him, because of the uncertainty of 
his venture. He sat with the op- 
erator of the shuttle and brood- 
ingly watched Earth get larger. 
There was Home; there was 
where his emotions were rooted, 
and those emotions would never 
let go. But he would blossom so 
far beyond the actual soil of 
Terra that, some day, he could 
never return. This was man’s 
130 



destiny, to rain his seeds on the 
other worlds of the universe and 
always, achingly, to remember 
Earth. 

There was one other passenger 
aboard the shuttle, who came 
forward just once and got him- 
self introduced to Martin. This 
other passenger was a remark- 
able person, with the beautifully 
shaped head, the symmetrical 
and pleasing jawline, the forth- 
right expression, the massively 
formed hands and arms of a man 
bom to the military. He was 
Major Whit Randolph, USA re- 
tired, now attached to the United 
Nations.' 

“The UN won’t let me get 
trapped on the Moon or Mars 
and certainly not — ” he almost 
spat the name — “Enceladus. 
They give me two days on the 
Moon, no more. I make my in- 
spection of the Base and write 
my report and then come back 
to Earth, which I’m doing now. 
I won’t get off Earth again until 
after the next session of the UN. 
Then I go to Mars.” 

“That’s a bit longer away,” 
said Martin. “But the flights are 
all rotary gravitized, so I hear.” 

“By law,” nodded Randolph. 
“The gravity-terrace effect; you 
pick your own weight.” He pro- 
duced his card. “You’ve got a 
problem, so if you want, call me, 
if only to talk. Until the UN 
meets, however I can be talked 

GALAXY 



into anything. However, I do 
have a suggestion. Make an ap- 
plication when we land on the 
Platform to stay at the City 
Training-In Center — that’s the 
best-equipped and best-staffed 
rehabilitation center in the Amer- 
icas. I should know.” 

A massive fist rubbed at mas- 
sive jaw; his gaze fastened pen- 
sively and somewhat darkly on 
the inexorably looming planet of 
their birth. One could imagine 
his lips, half-curled, muttering a 
curse, for reasons unknown. He 
returned his full attention to 
Martin. 

“That’s another thing,” he said. 
“In any event, if anybody can 
crank you up to run like an 
Earth machine, they can.” He 
smiled. “By the time you get to 
Earth, Martin, you’ll know if 
you’ve been accepted — by the 
fact that you will or will not be 
met at the ship by an ambulance, 
which will take you direct to the 
Center. Once they decide to help 
you, they don’t want you walking 
even an inch on Earth without 
their supervision. It will cost you 
ninety dollars a day, but it’s 
worth it.” 

Martin treasured Randolph’s 
card and placed it carefully in his 
billfold. He was genuinely grate- 
ful to have a man of Randolph’s 
stature make this gesture toward 
him. He suspected, however, that 
Randolph was at loose ends and 
TOUCH OF THE MOON 



was making the gesture in hopes 
that Martin would call him. Mar- 
tin decided he would. 

II 

, T - 'he City Training-In Center, 
•*- which accepted Martin, and 
did indeed meet him with an 
ambulance and a stretcher at 
the space port, demonstrated 
its efficiency by never once al- 
lowing him to feel he was in- 
volved in the task of his own 
rehabilitation. He was lifted and 
rolled; he was turned over and 
floated. The medical staff cali- 
brated the responses of every 
muscle in his body. The exercises 
he was required to perform were 
aimed at specific muscles, but 
they were so programmed that he 
seemed to be merely at play. He 
was also given considerable help 
with precise machines which spun 
him, patted him, stretched him, 
bent him, beat him, fluff-dried 
him. So, on the third day, Martin 
called San Francisco and spoke 
to his girl, which turned out to 
be a mistake. 

“Well, no,” he said bemusedly, 
“I can’t come there now, don’t 
you see I should spend a week 
here to get used to Earth after 
being away three months? I’ve 
got four more days here.” 

“Well,” she said from three and 
a half thousand miles away, “that 
means you can’t get here until 

131 



Thursday, and I’ll be leaving for 
Japan Thursday. I have a de- 
manding job, Martin.” 

“Meet you at the Kobe office, 
then, Friday?” he said hopefully. 

“Not unless you want my boss 
to chaperone us twenty-three 
hours a day with phone calls, 
which he’s liable to do. I’ll tell 
you what. I’ll meet you there 
tomorrow morning, and we’ll have 
a few bewitched hours together. 
You’ve been gone too too long!” 
She gave him an address high 
over Park Avenue and made 
kissing sounds over the phone. 

“All right, hon,” he said slowly, 
and hung up. 

He hadn’t even seen her face; 
she hadn’t even thrown in the 
visio. 

Tomorrow morning, then. 

Dr. V. Weller, the Director of 
the City Training-In Center, was 
exasperated even before Martin 
finished explaining his position. 
“I know what you’re trying to 
say,” he said. “It’s very very ob- 
vious. Your fiancee has put you 
in a bind, and you don’t know 
how to refuse her. But three days 
isn’t enough, Martin, it just isn’t 
enough.” 

“I’ll be gone an hour!” said 
Martin. “That’s all!” 

“Phh. So you say.” The acid 
little man leaned back and shook 
his head. “How often we’ve had 
to explain to young men such as 
yourself that your ardor far out- 

132 



matches your capacity to per- 
form! Exactly what do you think 
you’ll be able to do with your 
girl once you’re with her?” 

“Well — well, what do you 
mean, "do?” Martin faltered. “You 
must understand that although 
we are — ” 

nphe other quieted him down, 
patting the air with an anti- 
septic white hand. “No, I mean 
just the simple act of meeting her. 
Of standing there. Of throwing 
your arms about her. Of grabbing 
her and kissing her. Do you un- 
derstand how much oxygen debt 
your muscles will build up from 
those simple acts? Your Moon- 
muscles?” 

Martin simply acted miserably 
dumb. “I don’t know what an 
oxygen debt is.” 

“Naturally not,” Dr. V. Weller 
said sarcastically, picking up 
Martin’s chart and glaring at it. 
“You young dancing Moon men 
never do. Why do you think we 
pick you up in an ambulance and 
handle you like a baby, once we 
accept you? Well, remember this 
if you can. Muscles work anero- 
bically. Without oxygen, that is.” 
“Anerobically,” said Martin, 
crestfallen. “I remember. There 
are some anerobes on Mars. On 
Earth too. I think.” 

“That’s another thing! Let me 
finish. Muscles contract anero- 
bically. The organism simply 

GALAXY 



draws upon a store of energy ac- 
cumulated by previous oxidative 
processes. But when that store of 
energy, an organic phosphate, be- 
gins to decline, the organism 
must supply new oxygen. My 
God, boy, by the time you get 
off your first kiss to your sweetie, 
you’ll be panting like a love- 
struck stud!” 

Martin sank lower in his wheel- 
chair. “That’s putting it rather 
crudely,” he said, “but it gives 
me a picture.” 

“It better give you a picture,” 
the little man said, waving Mar- 
tin’s chart fiercely. “The Lunar 
environment weakens the muscu- 
lar organ by giving the body an 
excuse not to manufacture any 
more adenosine triphosphate than 
it finds necessary. A valuable 
habit pattern is lost; the organ- 
ism has to learn all over again 
what is required of it on Earth, 
do you understand? In a manner 
of speaking, the organism has to 
learn it isn’t on the Moon any 
more. Oh, sure, you know you’re 
on Earth. But do your tissues? 
They don’t.” 

“I see that now,”, said Martin, 
his voice weak and yielding. Oh, 
boy, he thought, I shouldn’t have 
called her; now how am I going 
to keep that date? And he would 
have to keep it somehow, some- 
how. By proxy, maybe. 

The sudden idea straightened 
his backbone. He said, nodding 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



his chin with new force at the 
chart this unpleasant little man 
was glaring fiercely at, “I take it, 
then, that the doctors have found 
nothing serious.” 

“No, your health hasn’t been 
damaged seriously by your stay 
on the Moon. You have a minor 
calcium leakage from the osseous 
structures, but usually this clears 
up in the eight or nine days we 
keep you here. And your — ” 

“ Eight days? Nine days?” 
“Yes, that’s right,” the man 
said, running his fingers in a 
crooked line on the chart and 
frowning mightily. “In your case, 
maybe a total of nine days.” 

“Six more days,” said Martin, 
sliding down in the wheel chair 
and looking laxly at the ceiling. 
“And it was supposed to be four 
more days. Maybe you’ll decide 
it should be seven more days. Or 
ten more days. Or never. Maybe 
you’ll decide I’ve been on the 
Moon too long, that after all it’s 
still highly problematical that 
anybody can really have a full- 
time recovery, everything’s still 
in the experimental stage, at 
ninety dollars a day — ” 

Dr. V. Weller suddenly was on 
his feet. He said icily, “Mr. 
Beales, if you would like to term- 
inate our contract, be sure you 
will receive no bill from us. We 
accept money only from those we 
have been successful with. Now 
if you are implying — ” 



133 



Martin shook his head and 
managed a sick grin as he started 
to turn the chair. “You’ve told 
me what I wanted to know,” he 
said. 

“I hope so. You dried-up, danc- 
ing Moon-men who think you can 
come back to Earth and right 
away compete with those of us 
who’ve had the good sense — ” 
He sat down abruptly, throwing 
Martin’s chart aside and bury- 
ing his face in other papers. Mar- 
tin figured that Dr. V. Weller felt 
he had said too much, implied 
too much. Martin rolled out sour- 
ly. So everybody had problems. 

'T'hat evening he called Major 
Whit Randolph at his Wis- 
consin home and left a curious 
elation when he heard the man’s 
crisp, wide-awake voice. Then, 
as the visio strengthened, he saw 
with astonishment that Randolph 
was in pajamas, short hair, the 
color of a dried leaf, uncombed. 

“But you sounded wide- 
awake,” he exclaimed. 

“You have to be,” said Ran- 
dolph cryptically, lighting up. 
“I’ve been in a war and a half, 
you know.” He studied Martin 
forthrightly. “You made it to the 
Center,” he said. “But you’ve got 
problems. What’s up?” Smoke 
shot from the corner of his 
mouth. 

“I made the mistake of calling 
my girl before I was ready,” 

134 



Martin told him in embarrass- 
ment. “Now the director here 
says I don’t have what it takes 
to carry on a romance — any 
part of a romance, even — until 
I’ve put in nine days here. In the 
meantime, I’ve made a date with 
her here in New York, and she’s 
arriving tomorrow morning.” 
But Randolph was already 
nodding his head, coolly flicking 
ashes. 

“The difficulty falls into a 
common pattern,” he said. “The 
pattern being that you can’t ex- 
plain matters to her. When can 
you ever? Luckily, I was tubing 
to New York the day after to- 
morrow — I can’t stand that 
Loop shot, it’s always the tube 
for me — but I’ll change my 
plans and meet your girl for you. 
How does that sound?” 

His eyes, which had been mov- 
ing rather restlessly in his face, 
now beamed directly at Martin. 

“Why — why it sounds great,” 
said Martin, taken aback first by 
the offer and then by the direct 
and somehow challenging ques- 
tion appended to it. “It would — 
well, it would certainly take me 
off the hook, if you know what 
I mean. Are you sure — ?” 

“That it isn’t putting me out? 
Hardly! Just tell me when and 
where you’re supposed to meet 
your girl and what she likes to 
drink.” 

Martin awoke often that night. 

GALAXY 



Finally, he was staring out the 
window at the gray morning, and 
he felt baffled and constricted by 
the inanities of this universe he 
must necessarily live in. Here he 
was, weakened by a stay of a few 
short weeks on the Moon, and 
his pride in his feeling of man- 
hood had put him in the position 
of turning over his girl to another 
man; a drinking man, a military 
man. A man twenty years older 
than Barbara — but what was 
twenty years to a man of Ran- 
dolph’s vitality? 

T) ar bara called Martin two 
^-'nights later from Japan. 

“But it’s all right,” she trilled, 
laughing. “It was a wonderful 
idea. Darling, I’m so glad you 
let mfe meet the major. I wouldn’t 
have missed it for anything. And 
the places he took us — ” 

“Us?” Martin’s ears pricked 
up. 

“He had a date, of course. It 
was so unselfish of him to in- 
clude me. As it turns out, it was 
lucky for him, because his date 
got sick at the Earth Turn — 
we were sitting on the inside cir- 
cle near the tintinnabula, so 
there wasn’t that much spin — I 
just don’t know what hit her, ex- 
cept that she was a tiny little 
thing, all eyes, and so tired. Any- 
way, we took her back to her 
apartment and put her to bed. 
Naturally, I consoled your dar- 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



ling major by sharing another 
round of drinks.” She giggled 
from ten thousand miles away. 
“Oh, we really rode the mare!” 
“I imagine,” said Martin dryly. 
Gazing upon the pixie, freckled 
face of his beloved he was at 
once bedazzled and in a helpless 
muse. 

“And darling,” she rushed on, 
pointing her finger at him, and 
then pointing it again, sternly, 
“when we get married, and if the 
major is available, and especially 
if he’s married again by that 
time, we want to invite him to 
our house often. Let’s never let 
him go. He’s one of the people 
we simply must hang onto.” 

“But if we’re living on the 
Moon,” Martin hazarded, taking 
the boldest conversational plunge 
he had ever managed with Bar- 
bara. 

She interrupted him, her pixie 
dimples suddenly disappearing. 

“Who wants to live on the 
Moon?” she said coolly. “Except 
for two or three days at a time 
like the major does?” 

“That’s right, who does?” said 
Martin, his eyes straying away 
from her image to rest on the 
blank wall beyond the telephone. 

“Oh, now I’ve hurt your feel- 
ings! Darling, look at me.” So he 
returned his gaze, feeling quite 
hopeless about the whole thing, 
and not even fooled by the wor- 
ried tenderness which now ap- 

1.35 



peared in her eyes and lips. “Dar- 
ling,” she said softly, “we’ll solve 
the problem, honest we will. Let’s 
give it time.” 

“And now guess what? Major 
says he’s going to call you and 
make arrangements for us to 
double-date with him and his 
girl the day you get out of the 
hospital!” 

“It’s not a hospital,” Martin 
hurriedly interposed. 

"Whatever it is. Anyway, you’ll 
be well then — ” 

“I’m not sick!” yelled Martin. 

She stared, sitting abruptly 
back from the audio. “No,” she 
said icily. “I’ll say you’re not. 
But I won’t get mad. It’ll be too 
wonderful to see you again, dear.” 
She blew him many kisses, smiled 
dazzlingly and was gone as he 
stupidly said good night. 

Ill 

'T'he next day Martin was 
suspended in a device com- 
posed of several balloon-like 
structures which blew up and 
blew down as he breathed. The 
doctor in charge was making 
readings from an instrument 
which measured nervous energy 
input and output. 

“The solar plexus is the key to 
the nervous and emotional health 
of mammalian life forms,” the 
medical man told Martin. “The 
solar plexus — we call it the 

136 



celiac plexus — is a bundle of 
nervous and venous tissue which 
somehow manufactures nervous 
energy, which is then used by the 
body in its coordinative func- 
tions.” 

“Somehow?” said Martin. 

The doctor nodded. “You’ve 
got a point,” he admitted. “The 
best we can say is that the mech- 
anism which stimulates the celiac 
into manufacturing nervous ener- 
gy is the abdominal muscle called 
the diaphragm. When we breathe, 
the diaphragm massages the cel- 
iac; physical energy is transduced 
into nervous energy — somehow. 
Proper breathing therefore is es- 
sential to the production of prop- 
er amounts of nervous energy. 
Which is to say — what we’ve 
known all along from the year 
one — proper breathing is essen- 
tial to our nervous and emotional 
health.” 

“A phone call for you, sir,” an 
attendant said at this moment 
from the door. 

“He’ll take it out there, but 
give me a moment,” said the doc- 
tor, frowning at the chart. 

He continued: “On the Moon, 
Mr. Beales, some startling things 
happen to our nervous systems, 
our breathing, our emotions. At 
first, as you perhaps don’t re- 
member, the rate of breathing in- 
creases. Presumably the much 
lower gravitation and the con- 
sequent lessened demand on the 

GALAXY 



muscular organ creates some kind 
of emotional backlash which re- 
quires more nervous energy than 
on Earth; one may feel anxious, 
perhaps sad, or one may be driv- 
en into euphoria. Then, as time 
passes, the unconscious mechan- 
isms of the body learn what is 
required of them on the Moon. 
There is less emotional disturb- 
ance and consequently a need for 
less emotional energy ... if we 
consider emotions somewhat de- 
finable as the rate of flow of 
nervous energy. Breathing then 
slows down. Now when one re- 
turns to Earth — ” 

“Breathing speeds up,” said 
Martin, waiting for the axe to fall 
and at the same time glancing 
nervously at the waiting phone 
beyond the door. 

The doctor smiled. “You look 
scared. Don’t be. I’m giving you 
some good news. You were on the 
Moon just long enough for your 
breathing to come back up near 
Earth normal. On our scale of 
1.0 your breathing stands at .9. 
By the time you leave here Sat- 
urday your breathing should be 
back up to normal. And that’s 
very good. Now go talk to your 
girl.” And he turned away, still 
smiling. 

T t wasn’t Barbara. It was Major 
Whit Randolph. Randolph was 
wearing a splotchy green, a very 
gay smoking jacket, and fumes 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



were coming from a long black 
pipe in his mouth. Through the 
fumes, Martin saw a tintinnabula 
ball dancing on its air-needle and 
spinning randomly to give off its 
radioactive, edgy music. On an 
end-table was a half-finished 
glass of what looked like gin on 
the rocks, and on Randolph’s 
knee sat a very pretty girl. 

“Hi, old son,” drawled Ran- 
dolph. “Top o’ the afternoon to 
you too. Martin, I want you to 
meet my girl. Claudina, curtsy 
for the Moon-Man.” 

Claudina blushed painfully, 
and caught Martin’s eyes as if 
searching for help. She spread 
her tiny hands helplessly. 

“I’m supposed to curtsy, sitting 
on his knee and captive to the 
United Nations,” she said. “Any- 
way, I’m pleased. He — my — 
the major tells me you’re re- 
habilitating from being on the 
Moon?” 

“That’s what the doctors like 
to call it,” Martin told her, cap- 
tured unavoidably and startling- 
ly by the strange ivory purity of 
her skin. Cradle snatcher, he 
thought. And those big eyes, just 
like Barbara said, big dark brown 
eyes resting on his naively and 
a trifle sadly, so that he felt a 
tiny lump in his throat. What 
went on here, anyway? Just 
what? 

“She’s nice, huh, Martin?” 
Randolph murmured from some- 

137 



where in the background. “But 
she saw me first, believe me! So 
whaddya say? Did Barbara tell 
you? We’re gonna take this town 
apart, level by level and all the 
way down to the sub-levels! 
Game?” 

Martin tore his gaze away from 
Claudina. “Game for what?” he 
muttered. 

Randolph laughed and pulled 
Claudina roughly to him so that 
she buried her head in his shoul- 
der. “She is sweet, isn't she?” And 
his eyes beamed at Martin a sud- 
den hard glimmer which was as 
suddenly lost in great fogging 
clouds of pipe smoke. Randolph’s 
hand slowly stroked the pale ash 
of her hair. Then his voice came 
again, comfortably sure of itself. 

“You heard me,” he said. “Fri- 
day’s the night. You’ll be free of 
the Center, your girl will be free 
from her job, Claudina will be 
free, I’ll be free, all free like 
birds. We’re double-dating, old 
son, like Barbara told you. 

“Now that Barbara,” he rushed 
on, not allowing Martin to an- 
swer. “You picked yourself a real 
live one, Martin. I like her. And 
she’s all set. Tubing in from Ja- 
pan Friday. We’re gonna ride the 
mare!” 

Friday. Was it possible that 
Randolph didn’t know he 
shouldn’t leave here before Sat- 
urday? Martin started to bring 
that point up, then clamped his 

138 



lips as mutiny began. The doctor 
told him his breathing was al- 
ready up to .9. To hell with the 
rest. He was feeling fit. 

nphe idea of taking the town 
apart on his first return date 
with Barbara didn’t appeal to 
Martin, but he was committed — 
in fact, hogtied. When he saw 
Barbara, though, his pulse jump- 
ed. To his astonishment, when he 
kissed her he didn’t get dizzy 
and fall down. 

“Whew!” she said, straighten- 
ing her quarter -hat and leaning 
back in his arms so she could 
look up and closely inspect him. 
“They really did let you out of 
the cage, didn’t they? Darling, 
you look wonderful.” 

He did look wonderful, nothing 
too startling except subdued blue. 
His dull black tagalong shoes 
went with his half-hat, the latter 
being the current affection of 
young married people in this per- 
iod, and his bid to give an im- 
pression of maturity. 

“Come on,” he said, grinning 
down at her and slipping his arm 
around her bare waist, beyond 
which shimmery green Baghdads 
fell to hand-woven ankle armor. 
“We’re meeting the major and his 
girl at Fifth Avenue Top Level — 
that’s the name of the place so 
you can always find your way 
back in case you wanna get drunk 
there again.” 



GALAXY 



“Me get drunk?” demanded 
Barbara, leaning toward him as 
if irresistibly drawn and kissing 
him soundly. That’s ridiculous!” 

They grabbed a yellocopter 
and programmed it for the Top. 
Randolph and Claudina were 
waiting for them at possibly the 
best table in the house. Randolph 
grinned widely and rushed toward 
them and pumped Martin’s hand 
up and down. Then Randolph 
and Barbara threw their arms 
around each other and adminis- 
tered their social kiss. And so the 
evening began. 

“This is all on me,” Randolph 
said from the first. “My Code. 
Ah! The champagne. Ladies and 
gentlemen, Terra-Frenault, of the 
exact year 2000! Best year Cali- 
fornia ever had! Let’s drink to 
that!” 

Claudina sat gay and straight 
in a yard of very white lace edged 
with startling ribbons of red bro- 
cade, a veritable Valentine of a 
girl who immediately refused her 
first glass of champagne. 

“Daddy doesn’t like,” she said. 
“Not until I’m twenty-one. The 
rules are very strict.” Impudent- 
ly she smiled upon her date. “Un- 
less you can talk me into it.” 

Barbara laughed delightedly. 
“What a marvelous daddy!” she 
cried. Then she leaned toward 
Randolph and squeezed his hand. 
“Go ahead!” she coaxed. “See 
what you can think up.” 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



Randolph seemed taken aback. 
“Oh,” said he. “You want me to 
help you break the family rules. 
Hmm. You’re nineteen, aren’t 
you? Nineteen Earth years. But 
you were on one of the Saturnian 
moons for at least a couple of 
its swings around the Big One, 
and that makes you twenty-one 
in my Code. Drink up!” 

“Thank you, sir,” said Clau- 
dina, flirting her eyes at him in a 
most exaggerated manner as she 
slowly brought the champagne to 
her lips. 

And Martin, watching, saw the 
tiny white fingers holding the del- 
icate stem tremble. 

Now a waiter hovered about 
them, filling and refilling their 
glasses. There was much light 
laughter as the evening began to 
set in. There was a mutual ad- 
miration of the girls for each 
other’s astounding hats. There 
was a broadly smiling camara- 
derie between Randolph and 
Martin, which on Martin’s part 
was his way of indicating to 
everybody how wonderful it was 
to be free of the Training-In Cen- 
ter and to be an Earth-man 
again — a man among men. 

IV 

J ust when the evening began 
to go wrong Martin would 
never really know. 

After all, it couldn’t have been 

139 



the champagne, for who could ar- 
gue with Terra-Frenault 2000? 
It couldn’t have been the dinner, 
an elaborate procession of white 
wine sauces, Filet a la planete 
101, Chicken a la “perp” planete 
Plymouth, all this fenced in or 
further embellished with aperitifs, 
breads, vegetables and deserts 
involving hot clam tomato bisque, 
la belle brioche, asparagus in 
vinaigrette, Ohio dandelion, ice 
creme de cacao, and this followed 
or augmented by brandy Alexan- 
ders. And it couldn’t have been 
Martin’s first dance with Barbara. 

True, he was anxious about his 
first dance with Barbara, but it 
all went smoothly except that it 
was not the slow dreamy waltz 
he would have preferred with her 
for this intimate moment under 
the bombs. The other couples 
were jerkily lengthening and 
shortening shadows, shadows that 
often exploded as strange lights 
burst inches above their heads or 
almost in their faces. The tin- 
tinnabula, that marvelous instru- 
mental invention of just the year 
before, was borrowing its full or- 
chestral arrangement randomly 
from the heart of the uranium 
atom — and it was just too wild. 

But not wild enough to make 
the evening go wrong. 

Then Randolph was dancing 
with Barbara, and this time — 
somehow — the tintinnabula fill- 
ed the glistening rainbow air with 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



the music one would find in the 

heart of water, and it was all so 

liquid and strange that something 

in Martin told him he should 

• 

cry, and to cry out that it was all 
wrong, that something had gone 
wrong under the bombs, and there 
was only lovely Claudina floating 
dreamwise in his arms and he 
couldn’t even tell her how he 
felt. 

And he wasn’t drunk. Of that 
he was sure. 

“You’re thinking,” murmured 
Claudina, dreamwise and peace- 
ful against his chest. “Not sup- 
posed to think, Martin. Just clink. 
Like a good ol’ Earth machine.” 

Martin breathed. Was he 
breathing for Earth or the Moon? 
I’ll breathe faster, he thought. 
He felt like he might be breath- 
ing at about .7. But maybe 
breathing faster wouldn’t do it. 
The solar plexus was out of the 
habit of transducing enough nerv- 
ous energy; no matter how fast 
the pumping diaphragm massag- 
ed it, it would refuse to cooperate. 
He shouldn’t have left the hos- 
pital — not Friday, maybe not 
Saturday, maybe not even Sun- 
day. When then? 

TJombs burst, splattered light. 
^Martin put the tip of his in- 
dex finger under Claudina’s chin 
and tilted her head up. One eye 
of Claudina winked red, another 
winked blue. 



141 



“Claudina,” said Martin in a 
drum voice to get past the span- 
gled rainy cry of the tintinnabula, 
“you were on Enceladus, moon 
of Saturn. Right?” 

“Right, sir!” She saluted 
smartly. “You’ve found me out, 
sir. I won’t do it again, sir.” 
Martin nodded. “The major 
said it like a cuss-word the first 
time I met him,” he said. “How 
long?” 

“Too long, sir!” 

"And you were probably at the 
City Training- In Center before I 
was. But before that, you must 
have done a lot of planet-hopping 
— Pallas, Juno, Vesta, Hermes, 
probably Mars, in ascending or- 
ders of gravitation. Finally Earth, 
and the" Center.” 

“First the Moon,” she answer- 
ed, “and then Mars, and then 
Earth and the Center. Cost my 
daddy a pile of money, just get- 
ting me here on this dance floor.” 
She essayed a wide smile which 
crumbled into ruins. Her lips pull- 
ed down severely. Unkind lights 
danced between them to turn her 
saffron and blinking white. 

She gasped, “Oh, Martin I hate 
to think about it, in a way. I dis- 
obeyed my daddy’s orders and 
took a job on Enceladus. It took 
him a long time to find me — but 
it was beautiful, Martin, and ro- 
mantic, whizzing around Saturn 
every day and a third. I wasn’t 
very fit for Earth after that, 

142 



though, and the Government 
folders played that part down, 
about how it would affect you. 
Your nervous system mostly. I 
get very tired. I get so depressed.” 

She breathed for awhile, and 
they simply danced very slowly. 

“I just haven’t come out of it 
at all,” she said. “The doctors say 
give it time — you know the doc- 
tors. Dr. Weller said I’m breath- 
ing just fine!” 

She breathed hard against his 
neck, with a warm little puff of 
air that widened his eyes. “See?” 
She giggled a musical two-note 
which ended on a gasp. Worried, 
half-ashamed, her eyes sought 
his. They were hardly moving 
now. His arm tightened around 
her, halfway holding her up, and 
he remembered Mabel, who 
couldn’t find a proper center of 
gravity. There was no such trou- 
ble with Claudina. He thought 
bleakly, Claudina, Claudina, we 
should be dancing on the Moon; 
it’d be a helluva lot less trouble. 

“Martin — ” Claudina spoke 
his name against his chest. Then 
her head came up, fringes of her 
pale hair having come loose from 
her coiffure and partly shadow- 
ing eyes that glowed and novaed 
from random bomb-lights. She 
said timidly, “Martin — Martin, 
if we were dancing on the Moon 
— you know, one of those beauti- 
ful places under the Moon — if 
we were it would be so nice.” 

GALAXY 



“Yes, it would,” he said stead- 
ily. “What about the major?” 

“The major!” She laughed; her 
laugh was a dry sound, but full 
of air bubbles, a series of de- 
lighted gasps. “Oh, Martin,” she 
gasped. “Let’s just call the major 
an old friend of the family, shall 
we? A — a very old adored — 
friend.” 

Ohe was still smiling, half-laugh- 
^ ing, when they stopped danc- 
ing, as if by mutual consent, and 
wended back, through confetti 
streamers of brilliance seemingly 
borrowed from a distance star, 
toward their table with fingers 
loosely intertwined. They sat 
there, saying nothing, their glanc- 
es occasionally touching, then 
wandering away toward the danc- 
ers where the major and Barbara 
were part of the moving, voluptu- 
ous, pristine scene. 

Martin knew what had gone 
wrong, and it was very depress- 
ing. 

He watched as Randolph and 
Barbara came back. Barbara 
leaned over and pressed her 
smooth face hard against his, then 
pressed his nose in with her fin- 
ger. 

“You and Claudina stopped 
dancing,” she said. She took his 
hand. “Come on.” 

A real orchestra had taken the 
place of the tintinnabula. A 
thrumming, a humming, a very 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



adverse beat, called the splittable, 
underlay the surface gracefullness 
of an old waltz. Martin hesitated, 
then turned to Claudina to excuse 
himself. Claudina was drooping, 
her shoulders no longer erect, her 
face in shadow looking down at 
her drink. 

The major, not yet seated, saw 
this, too. His face wrenched 
strangely. But Claudina raised 
her head, raised her glass. “I’m all 
right,” she smiled. “Too much 
cerebration, not enough celebra- 
tion. We could dance now. Ma- 
jor.” She added, insisting, “I’m 
all right!” 

“No,” Randolph said shortly, 
sitting. “You stay there.” 

On the dance floor, Barbara 
wiped Martin’s forehead with his 
wrist handkerchief. “We don’t 
have to dance,” she said worried- 
ly. “It’s just that we haven’t 
danced three times already.” 

He smiled down at her. “How 
could we?” he asked lightly. “You 
and the major danced those 
dances. I think he likes you, 
Barbara-pal-lover-doll. I wouldn’t 
be surprised if he didn’t pay the 
tintinnabula operator to tune in 
on those radioactive numbers. 
They were wild!” 

Her pixie dimples were doing 
their disappearing act. She said, 
“You never had any trouble 
keeping up with anything the 
tintinnabula handed out before. 
No matter what the randomity 

143 



factor. Are you trying to tell 
me — ?” 

A colored globe burst between 
them. The contorting shadows of 
couples or triplets who elected to 
follow the fast, unpredictable, 
subterranean beat produced a 
weird stroboscopic effect which 
presented Barbara’s face to Mar- 
tin in jumping expressions which 
ranged from irritation, to resigna- 
tion, to anger, to disappointment. 

Martin said, “I’m only trying 
to tell you that the major likes 
you.” 

“And I like him!” she snapped. 
“So what?” 

Martin said patiently, “He 
knew I shouldn’t leave the Train- 
ing-In Center until tomorrow, 
but he made arrangements for 
tonight.” He paused and breathed 
for awhile. “You see what it’s 
doing to me. By the way. How 
did the major like Japan?” 

Qhe was silent a moment. “Ah,” 
^ she said. “So. The major was 
wining me, dining me, dancing 
me while I was working at a job 
that takes all the glucose out of 
my backbone. I think you and I 
better sit this one out. Come on, 
Martin, my beloved.” She took 
his hand and attempted to draw 
him off the floor. 

“No,” he said stubbornly. “You 
don’t get it yet, what he’s doing 
to us. He’s trying to break us up, 
Barbara. It’s so obvious! Clau- 



dina isn’t his girl, she’s just — 
somebody; somebody, an old 
friend of the family, a darling 
child he’s worried about. He’s 
throwing her at me so he can get 
you!” 

He felt his voice rising. Almost 
out of nowhere he felt her cool 
finger across his lips. She whis- 
pered, “Don’t you like her, Mar- 
tin?” 

“Who the hell could help but 
like her?” he almost yelled. 
“What’s that got to do with it?” 

“She was on a moon of Saturn, 
that’s what,” said Barbara 
through compressed lips. “Prob- 
ably too long for her own good. 
Now come on.” She renewed her 
grip on his hand, and they trailed 
back to the table. 

Major Whit Randolph stood 
up as they approached, smiling. 
But his eyes were beaming direct- 
ly at Martin; speculatively. As 
Martin approached the table, 
Randolph started to say some- 
thing, but Martin felt his hand 
turning into a rock. He hit Ran- 
dolph a solid, overhand blow on 
the jaw. The shock wave traveled 
through his numbed fist up his 
arm and into his shoulder and 
then, presumably, into his brain. 
He watched in surprised horror 
as the major, rather obviously, 
staggered back, then sank to the 
floor, shaking his head, and 
swearing under his breath, and 
working his jaw.

GALAXY 



Some couples nearby came to 
their feet or turned their heads 
slightly for better peripheral vis- 
ion. Three waiters, however, 
stopped what they were doing 
and unobtrusively ringed the 
scene and looked blandly off in- 
to nowhere. 

Barbara stood helplessly over 
Randolph, shaking her head. 
“You shouldn’t have done that, 
Martin,” she said. “You just 
shouldn’t.” She stooped as if to 
help Randolph but he waved her 
savagely away and came up on 
one elbow. 

“Never mind,” he said. “Let 
him think he’s got a punch.” 

A bomb skittered in from the 
heaving dance floor and burst 
near his face, lighting him in 
clown colors. It adequately show- 
ed eyes that were narrowed like 
gun emplacements in a fortress. 

“Martin — ” pacing his words 
as if each had a cannon behind 
it — “you called the turn. I did 
plot against you, from the first 
minute I saw you. You were my 
pigeon! Now why in hell don’t 
you wake up? You’ll never marry 
Barbara, because she’ll never let 
herself get trapped away from 
Earth. And you can’t live on 
Earth, any more than Claudina 
can. Now why in hell don’t you 
go back to the Moon and take 
my daughter with you!” 

Martin was staring hopelessly 
at the terrestrial fury of the bil- 

TOUCH OF THE MOON 



lowing dance floor. He saw that 
Barbara was watching him, try- 
ing to smile, losing the smile, 
bringing the smile back again. 
Martin thought: The darling pix- 
ie dimples I will never kiss again. 
She’s for Earth, and I’m for the 
Moon and the spaces beyond. 
And Claudina, too, trapped as he 
had been, only worse, on a Moon 
of Saturn. Darling Claudina, 
sweet, helpless Claudina, lost for- 
ever to Earth, spewed forever 
outward to walk the worlds of 
Canopus, Antares, Betelgeuse, 
Sirius. 

V 

r T~'he tips of their fingers in- 
tertwined, Claudina and 
Martin slowly entered the office 
of Dr. V. Weller, Director of the 
City Training-In Center. Weller 
was extremely cordial, all smiles, 
and held out chairs for them. 
Martin said, hesitantly, “I called 
you because I wanted to apol- 
ogize for running off as I did, 
and I also wanted to settle my 
bill.” 

Weller was leaning forward be- 
hind his desk, full of repressed 
curiosity. “This isn’t your girl,” 
he said finally. “Not the one you 
came to see. Not our Claudina!” 
Avidly he studied Martin. “What 
happened?” he demanded, and 
added as an afterthought, and 
very politely, “You see. young 

145 



man, in our work we are still 
groping. We need all the case 
histories we can get. For our files, 
you see? Now. What happened?” 
With a strange tenacity the Di- 
rector pumped both Martin and 
Claudina for even the personal 
details. Then his chair creaked 
as he threw back his head and 
laughed. The laugh, Martin noted 
sourly, was not a humorous one. 

“You kids!” the director said. 
“So now you’ll get married, set 
up housekeeping on the Moon 
and dance your lives away and 
call it love. Phh!” 

Martin started to get up. Clau- 
dina tented four fingers on his 
knee and held him down. 

She squinted at Weller, turn- 
ing her head sidewise, in mock 
reproval. “Dr. Weller,” she said 
firmly, “Martin and I are in love. 
My daddy wanted somebody 
nice to take care of me on the 
Moon, so he picked Martin, and 
. well, that’s it. His plans work- 
ed out.” 

“Kind of a military campaign,” 
grunted Weller. 

“With flanking movements 
and rearguard action,” nodded 
Claudina. “My daddy is a very 
smart man!” 

“Obviously,” said Weller sar- 
castically. “But who do you think 
was smarter. Mother Earth, that’s 
who!” 

“Mother Earth,” said Martin, 
looking hopelessly at the door. 

146 



“Certainly. She sucked the 
nervous energies out of you two 
so you had to fall in each other’s 
arms to stay on your feet. So 
that’s love! Is that what you’re 
going to use to build yourselves 
a happy life? Obviously it is.” 

T Tis thin lips were pulled tight 
in a watchful grin. The two 
faces he looked at across his desk 
were crestfallen and startled. 
Then Martin’s face began to turn 
red with confusion and anger. 
Weller’s chair scuttled back as 
he came quickly around the desk 
and leaned against it and put his 
hand on Martin’s shoulder, again 
keeping him down. 

“I meant no harm,” he said 
quickly. “On the contrary, I was 
hoping you could understand 
some of the forces that are work- 
ing on you ... as I am begin- 
ning to understand what forces 
work on me. You see — ” 

A strange agitation thinned his 
already thin face. 

• “You see, Martin, Claudina 

— ” his forehead shone damply 

— “we who live here and stay 
here on Earth, contrary to our 
boasts, may be the real fools. I’m 
beginning to see that we are liv- 
ing through a very traumatic ex- 
perience. This damned, heavy 
planet, pulling on our bones and 
our muscles and our organs and 
killing us years ahead of our 
time!” 



GALAXY 



He thrust out his antiseptic 
hand, where it quivered and 
shook minutely. 

“Tell me, you two, what’s mak- 
ing it shake like that? What’s 
making me lean against this desk 
instead of standing up like a 
man? What sends me to bed 
three hours before bedtime and 
makes me creak when I get up? 
What makes me the irrascible, 
unpleasant, arrogant pipsqueak 
that I am? What sucks the nerv- 
ous energies out of me?” 

He was grinding the words out 
and pushing himself to an up- 
right position. 

He dropped his hand, and his 
expression lightened, became 
even pleasant. “You see?” he 



said. “Now you know why you’re 
going back to the Moon. The 
Earth trauma. The Earth trauma 
— which you don’t really know 
about until you’ve been out there 
and back.” 

/'~ > ilaudina and Martin were mar- 
'- >4 ried on the Moon. One year 
later, Major Whit Randolph mar- 
ried Barbara. Four thousand 
years later their descendants 
swarmed the myriad worlds of 
the galaxy, of Canopus, Antares, 
Betelgeuse, Sirius. And all this 
time the matriachal Earth smiled, 
secretly proud of the devices she 
used to force her brood fluttering 
away from the nest.

THE 

DECEIVERS 

by 

LARRY NIVEN 

Lovely i deo, these 
restaurants without 
a human waiter .. • 
as long as nothing 
went wrong! 



\ waiter came to meet them as 
they landed. It crossed the 
restaurant like a chess pawn 
come to life, slid to a graceful 
stop on the carport balcony, hesi- 
tated long enough to be sure it 
had their attention, then moved 
inside at a slow walking pace. 

The sound of its motion was 
a gentle whisper of breeze from 
under the lip of its ground-effect 
skirt. It guided them across the 
floor of the Red Planet, between 
and around occupied tables, emp- 
ty tables, tables which displayed 
decorative meats and bowls of 
flowers, and other whispering 
robot waiters. At a table for two 
on the far side of the room, it 
deftly removed one chair to ac- 
comodate Lucas Garner’s travel 
chair. Somehow it had recognized 
Luke as a paraplegic. It held 



the other chair for Lloyd Masney 
to sit down. 

The murals on the restaurant 
walls were dull red and bright 
silver: a Ray Bradbury Mars, 
with the silver spires of an anci- 
ent Martian city nestling among 
red sands. A straight canal 
dwindled into the distance at 
both sides of the big room. Its 
silver waters actually crossed the 
floor and were in turn crossed 
by bridges. Attenuated, fragile 
Martians moved through the 
streets of the mural. Sometimes 
they looked curiously out at the 
customers, the human intruders 
in their make-believe world. 

“Strange place,” said Masney. 
He was a big, compact man with 
white hair and a bushy white 
moustache. 

Luke didn’t answer. When 






148 



Masney glanced up he was 
startled by his friend’s malevo- 
lent expression. “What’s wrong?” 
he asked, and turned to follow 
Luke’s eyes. 

Luke was glaring his extreme 
distaste at a target which could 
only have been the robot waiter. 

r T~'he waiter was a standard 
make. Below a blank spheri- 
cal head was a body cylindrical 
for most of its length. The arms 
it had used to adjust Masney’s 
chair for him had already van- 
ished into panels in its torso, to 
join other specialized arms and 
hands and interior shelves for 
carrying food. Like all the other 
waiters, it had been painted in an 
abstract pattern of dull red and 
bright silver to match the murals. 
The last foot of the robot’s cylin- 
drical torso was a short, flaring 
skirt. Like Luke’s travel chair, 
the waiter moved on a ground- 
effect air cushion. 

“What’s wrong?” Masney re- 
peated. 

“Nothing,” said Luke. He 
picked up the menu. 

The robot waited for their or- 
ders. Motionless, with all its arms 
retracted, it had become a pop- 
art barber pole. 

“Come on, Luke. Why were 
you looking at the waiter like 
that?” 

“I don’t like robot waiters.” 

“Mph? Why not?” 

THE DECEIVERS 



“You grew up with ’em. I 
didn’t. I’ve never got used to 
them.” 

“What’s to get used to? 
They’re waiters. They bring 
food.” 

“All right,” said Luke, study- 
ing the menu. 

He was old. It was not spinal 
injury that had cost him the use 
of his legs these past ten years. 
Too many spinal nerves had 
worn out with age. A goatee had 
once adorned his chin, but now 
his chin was as bald as his brows 
and scalp. His face, Satanic in 
its wrinkled age, attracted in- 
stant attention, so that his every 
vagrant thought seemed exag- 
gerated in his expression. The 
loose skin of his arms and shoul- 
ders half-hid the muscles of a 
wrestler: the only part of him 
that seemed young. 

“Every time I think I know 
you,” said Masney, “you surprise 
me. You’re a hundred and seven- 
ty-four now, aren’t you?” 

“You sent me a birthday card.” 

“Oh, I can count. But I can’t 
grasp it. You’re almost twice my 
age. How long ago did they in- 
vent robot waiters?” ~ 

“Waiters weren’t invented. 
They evolved, like computers.” 

“When?” 

“You were just learning to 
spell when the first all-auto^ 
mated restaurant opened in New 
York.” 



149 



Masney smiled and shook his 
head gently. “All that time, and 
you never got used to them. Con- 
servative, that’s you.” 

Luke put the menu down. “If 
you must know, something hap- 
pened to me once in connection 
with robot waiters. I had your 
job about then.” 

“Oh?” Lloyd Masney was 
Superintendent of Police for 
Greater Los Angeles. He’d taken 
his desk from Luke after Luke 
had resigned to become an Arm 
of the UN, forty years back. 

“I was just getting used to the 
job; I’d only held it a couple 
of years. When was it? I can’t re- 
member; around 2025, I think. 
They were just introducing auto- 
mated restaurants. They were 
just introducing a lot of things.” 
“Weren’t they always?” 



( ( \ T aturally, naturally. Quit 
interrupting. Around ten 
that morning I took a ciga- 
rette break. I had the habit of 
doing that every ten minutes. I 
was thinking about getting back 
to work when Dreamer Glass 
walked in. Old friend, Dreamer. 
I’d sent him up for a ten-year 
stretch for false advertising. 
He’d just got out and he was 
visiting some old friends.” 
“With a firegun?” 

Luke’s smile was a startling 
flash of new white teeth. “Oh, no. 
Dreamer was a nice guy. Little 
150 



too much imagination, that’s all. 
We put him away for telling tele- 
vision audiences that his brand 
of dishwashing liquid was good 
for the hands. We tested it, and 
it wasn’t. I always thought he 
got too stiff a sentence, but — 
well, the Intent-to-Deceive laws 
were new then, and we had to 
bear down hard on the test cases 
so John Q would know we meant 
it.” 

“Nowadays he’d get the organ 
banks.” 

“We didn’t put criminals in 
the organ banks in those days. 
I wish we’d never started. 

“So Dreamer went to jail on 
my evidence. Five years later I 
was Superintendent. Another two 
years and he was out on parole. 
I was no busier than usual the 
day he showed up, so I dug out 
the guests’ bottle, and we poured 
it in our coffee. And talked. 
Dreamer wanted me to fill him 
in on the last ten years. He’d 
been talking to other friends, so 
he knew something. But there 
were odd gaps that could have 
gotten him in trouble. He knew 
about the Jupiter probe, for in- 
stance, but he’d never heard of 
hard and soft plith. 

“I wish I’d never mentioned 
robot restaurants. 

“At first he thought I was talk- 
ing about a bigger and better 
automat. Then when he got the 
idea, he was wild to see it. 

GALAXY 



“So I took him to lunch at the 
Herr Ober, which was a few 
blocks from the old Police Head- 
quarters Building. Herr Ober was 
the first all-automated restaurant 
in Ellay. The only human be- 
ings involved were the mainten- 
ance crew, and they only show- 
ed up once a week. Everything 
else, from the kitchen to the hat- 
check girl, was machinery. I’d 
never eaten there — ” 

“Then how did you know so 
much about it?” 

tl \A/ e ’d had to chase a man 
’ ’in there a month earlier. 
He’d picked up a kid for ransom, 
and he still had her for a hos- 
tage. At least, we thought he did. 
Another story. Before I could 
figure how to get at him, I’d had 
to study the Herr Ober top to 
bottom.” Luke snorted. “Look at 
that metal idiot. He’s still waiting 
for our order. You! Get us two 
Vurguuz martinis.” The pop-art 
barber pole rose an inch from 
the floor and slid off. “Where 
was I? 

“Oh, yeah. The place wasn’t 
crowded, which was a break. We 
picked a table, and I showed 
Dreamer how to punch the sum- 
mons button to call a waiter. We 
already called them waiters, but 
they didn’t look anything like 
the ones here. They were nothing 
but double-decker serving trays 
on wheels, with senses and mo- 
THE DECEIVERS 



tors and a typewriter all packed 
into one end.” 

“Ran on wheels, too, I’ll bet.” 

“Yah. Noisy. But in those days 
it was impressive. Dreamer was 
bug-eyed. When that animated 
tray came for our orders he just 
stared. I ordered for both of us. 

“We downed our drinks and 
had another round. Dreamer told 
me about the Advertisers’ Club 
that somehow got formed in his 
cell block. The cigarette men 
could have controlled it to the 
eyes, there were so many of 
them, but they couldn’t agree on 
anything. What they really want- 
ed to do was form a convict’s 
lobby in Washington.” 

The waiter appeared with the 
martinis. 

“Anyway, we had our drinks 
and ordered. Identical meals, be- 
cause Dreamer still wasn’t cap- 
able of making a decision. He 
kept staring around, grinning. 

“The waiter brought us shrimp 
cocktails. While we were eating, 
Dreamer tried to pump me on 
who might have the advertising 
concession on the robots. Not on 
the restaurant, but on all the au- 
tomatic machinery. There he was, 
knowing nothing about compu- 
ters, but all ready to go out and 
sell them. I tried to tell him he’d 
picked a good way to get back 
in Quentin, but he wouldn’t list- 
en. 

“We finished the shrimp, and 

151 



the waiter brought us two more 
shrimp cocktails. Dreamer said, 
‘What’s this?’ 

“ ‘I must have typed wrong,’ 
I told him. ‘I wanted two lunch- 
es, but the damn thing is bring- 
ing us two lunches each.” 
“Dreamer laughed. ‘I’ll eat 
them both,’ he said, and did. 
‘Ten years is a long time between 
shrimp cocktails,’ he said. 

“The waiter took our empty 
cups away and brought us two 
more shrimp cocktails. 

“ ‘This is too much of a good 
thing,’ said Dreamer. ‘Where do 
I go to talk to the manager?’ 

“ ‘I told you, it’s all automatic. 
The manager’s a computer in the 
basement.’ 

“ ‘Does it have an audio circuit 
for complaints?’ 

“ ‘I think so.’ 

“ ‘Where do I find it?’ 

“I looked around, trying to re- 
member. ‘Over there. Past the 
payment counter. But I don’t — ’ 
“Dreamer got up. ‘I’ll be right 
back,’ he said. 

( C T T e was, too. He came back 
within seconds, and he 
was shaking. ‘I couldn’t get out 
of the dining room,’ he told me. 
‘The payment counter wouldn’t 
let me by. There was a barrier. 
I tried to give it some money, 
but nothing happened. When I 
tried to go over the barrier, I 
got an electric shock!’ 

152 



“ ‘That’s for deadbeats. It 
won’t let you by until you pay 
for your lunch. You can’t pay 
until you get a bill from the 
waiter.’ 

“ ‘Well, let’s pay and get out. 
This place scares me.’ 

“So I pushed the summons 
button, and the waiter came. Be- 
fore I could reach the typer it 
had given us two more shrimp 
cocktails and moved away. 

“ ‘This is ridiculous,’ said 
Dreamer. ‘Look, suppose I get 
up and stand around at the 
other side of the table. That way 
you can reach the typer when it 
delivers the next round, because 
I’ll be blocking it from leaving.’ 
“We tried it. The thing 
wouldn’t come to our table until 
Dreamer sat down. Didn’t recog- 
nize him standing up, maybe. 
Then it served two more shrimp 
cocktails, and Dreamer got up 
quick and moved behind it. I had 
my hands on the typer when it 
backed off and knocked Dreamer 
flat. 

“He got so mad, he stood up 
and kicked the first waiter that 
came by. The waiter shocked him 
good, and while he was getting 
up the thing tossed him a printed 
message to the effect that robot 
waiters were expensive and deli- 
cate and he shouldn’t do that.” 
“That’s true,” Masney said, 
deadpan. “He shouldn’t.” 

“I’d have been helping him 
GALAXY 



do it, but I wasn’t sure what 
those machines would do next. 
So I stayed in my seat and 
planned what I’d do to the guy 
who invented robot waiters, if I 
ever got out of there to track 
him down. 

“Dreamer got up shaking his 
head. Then he started trying to 
get help from the other diners. I 
could have told him that 
wouldn’t work. Nobody wanted 
to get involved. In the big cities 
they never do. Finally one of the 
waiters shot a slip at him that 
told him to stop bothering the 
other diners, only it was more 
polite than that. 

“He came back to our table, 
but this time he didn’t sit down. 
He looked scared. ‘Listen, Gar- 
ner,’ he said, ‘I’m going to try 
the kitchen. You stay here. I’ll 
bring help.’ And he turned and 
started away. 

“I yelled, ‘Come back here! 
We’ll be all right if — ’ But 
by that time he was out of ear- 
shot, heading for the kitchen 
door. I know he heard me shout. 
He just didn’t want to be 
stopped. 

“The door was only four feet 
tall, because it was built for 
robots. Dreamer ducked under it 
and was gone. I didn’t dare go 
after him. If he made it, fine, I’d 
have help. I didn’t think he 
would. 

“There was one more thing I 
THE DECEIVERS 



wanted to try. I pushed the sum- 
mons button, and when the waiter 
came with two more shrimp cock- 
tails I typed ‘Phone’ before it 
could get away.” 

“To phone Headquarters? You 
should have tried that earlier.” 

tCQure. But it didn’t work. 

^ The waiter scooted off and 
brought me another shrimp 
cocktail. 

“So I waited. By and by 
everyone disappeared, and I was 
alone in the Herr Ober. When- 
ever I got hungry enough I’d eat 
some crackers or a shrimp cock- 
tail. The waiter kept bringing me 
more water and more shrimp 
cocktails, so that was all right. 

“I left notes on some tables, 
so that when the dinnertime 
crowd showed up they’d be 
warned. But the waiters removed 
the notes as fast as I wrote them. 
Keeping things neat. I quit that 
and waited for rescue. 

“Nobody came to rescue me. 
Dreamer never came back. 

“Six o’clock, and the place fill- 
ed up again. Along about nine, 
three couples at a nearby table 
started getting an endless supply 
of canapes Lorenzo. I watched 
them. Eventually they got so 
mad that the six of them circled 
the waiter and picked it up. The 
waiter spun its wheels madly, 
and then it shocked them and 
they dropped it. It fell on one 

153 



man’s foot. Everyone in the place 
panicked. When the dust cleared 
there were only the seven of us 
left. 

“The others were trying to de- 
cide what to do about the guy 
with his foot under the waiter. 
They were afraid to touch the 
waiter, of course. It wouldn’t 
have taken my order, because I 
wasn’t at one of its tables, but I 
got one of the others to type an 
order for aspirin, and off it went. 

“So I got the six of them back 
to their table and told them not 
to move. One of the girls had 
sleeping pills. I fed three to the 
guy with the smashed foot. 

“And so we waited.” 

“I hate to ask,” said Masney, 
“but what were you waiting for?” 
“Closing time!” 

“Oh, of course. Then what?” 
“At two o’clock our waiters 
stopped bringing us shrimp cock- 
tails and canapes Lorenzo and 
brought us our bills. You 
wouldn’t believe what they 
charged me for all those shrimp 
cocktails .... We paid our bills 
and left, carrying the guy with 
the smashed foot. We took him to 
a hospital, and then we got to a 
phone and called everybody in 
sight. Next day the Herr Ober 
was closed for repairs. It never 
reopened.” 

“What about Dreamer?” 

“He’s one reason the place never 
reopened. Never found him.” 

154 



“He couldn’t just disappear.” 
“Couldn’t he?” 

“Could he?” 

“Sometimes I think he must 
have taken advantage of the pub- 
licity. Started life over some- 
where else, with no prison record. 
And then I remember that he 
went into a fully automated 
kitchen, through a door that 
wasn’t built for humans. That 
kitchen machinery could handle 
full-sized sides of beef. Dreamer 
obviously wasn’t a robot. What 
would the kitchen machinery 
take him for?” 

Masney thought about it. 

Tt came to Masney as they were 
finishing desert. 

“Mmmb!” he said. “Mmmb!” 
And he swallowed frantically. 
“You fink! You were sent straight 
from Homicide branch to super- 
intendent. You never had any- 
thing to do with the Intent to 
Deceive Branch!” 

“I thought you’d catch that.”

'lX7'hat is the matter with the 
^ ' times? Children no longer 
respect their parents, Church and 
State are at an intersection, and 
at times it is apparently bad to 
be against sin and for mother- 
hood. What is the matter with 
the times? Well, perhaps it would 
be useful to ask, “What is the

To look at me, you would 
never know the seething inside. 
I’d imagine that the same is true 
of you, but I can’t tell by looking 
at you. Nevertheless, I take it on 
faith that you’re like me — that 
it would take days and days to 
tell your life story the way it 
should be told, slashed with re- 
collections and injuries, dotted 
with moments of utter clarity, 
jammed with hard lessons learned 
on the instant. I don’t believe 
that such a thing as a true bio- 
graphy of anyone grown up is 
even remotely possible. If we 
tried to grasp all the things that 
were important to us, and if we 
tried to tell someone each and 
every one of them in the cor- 
rect order and with logic, we 
never would get past recounting 
the first hour of our first con- 
scious day. 

We’re chaos inside; a web of 
interlaced reactions, memories of 
actions, wants, needs, titillations, 
passions, horrors ... I seem to 
remember the hard lessons very 
vividly. 

Joy takes just a little more 
work to recollect. I hope it’s not 
that way for you, though I sus- 
pect it is. 

What, then, wouldn’t I do for 
some small comfort? I could use 
an indication that someone knows 
my sorrow. I’d have some hope 
tomorrow will be better. And 
you?

A l 'his is a review of a book called 
Dangerous Visions, edited to 
inflame by Harlan Ellison. Pub- 
lished by Doubleday, at $6.95, it 
contains over a quarter of a mil- 
lion words in the form of thirty- 
three stories by thirty-two sci- 
ence-fiction and fantasy writers 
of one kind or another. Several 
of them are science-fiction and 
fantasy writers you never heard 
of, but most of them are very 
familiar names. 

Ellison says: 

“What you hold in your hands 
is more than a book. If we are 
lucky it is a revolution. 

“This book, all two hundred 
and thirty-nine thousand words 
of it, the largest anthology of 
speculative fiction ever published 
of all original stories, and one of 
the largest of any kind, was con- 
structed along specific lines of 
revolution. It was intended to 
shake things up. It was conceived 
out of a need for new horizons, 
new forms, new styles, new chal- 
lenges in the literature of our 
times. If it was done properly, it 
will provide these new horizons 
and styles and forms and chal- 
lenges. If not, it is still one hell- 
uva good book full of entertain- 
ing stories.” 

You should buy this book im- 
mediately. If necessary, you 
should also spend the cab fare 
needed to get to the nearest book- 
store. You should do this because 



GALAXY 



this is a book that knows perfect- 
ly well that you are seething in- 
side. It represents the equivalent 
of a warm tender touch in the 
dark, just when you thought you 
were trapped in here with stran- 
gers. 

Your problem is going to be 
that, shortly after you make this 
discovery, another hand will 
reach you from another direction. 
And then another. And another. 
In a very short while, you are 
going to be in the middle of the 
damnest melee of would-be com- 
forters, and it is only to be hoped 
that, after shaking off the experi- 
ence, you are not driven to over- 
compensate by fleeing forthwith 
to a nunnery for the remainder 
of your natural life. 

What am I talking about? Well, 
to begin with, it sounds as if I’m 
talking about a great many 
things. But what I mean to say 
by them is that we are all human, 
and by the same token we are all 
to some extent frustrated. We 
have wanted things that we have 
not been able to get, and no 
matter what face we put on this 
when we go about our daily do- 
ings, the memory is blood red 
and clear in our minds inside. 
Somehow, in many cases, no 
amount of joy can overlay or di- 
lute this. 

We have been robbed, cheated, 
lied to and betrayed. It’s no com- 
fort to be told that this is mere- 



ly the result of the nature of the 
world and of human society. That 
happens to people in textbooks. 
What has happened to us has 
happened to us. It has happened 
to me, it has probably happened 
to you because you are like me, 
and it has most assuredly hap- 
pened to Harlan Ellison. 

Harlan is articulate, though not 
always coherent. He is vastly en- 
ergetic. He is a promotional gen- 
ius. And in consequence we have 
this book, which apparently rep- 
resents a gathering of people who 
are of like mind with Harlan, who 
may !be people like me, and may 
be people like you. 

Since a book cannot be a rev- 
olution, no matter what Harlan 
says, but can only reflect one, 
and since a book of fiction can 
provide nothing, but can only 
evoke responses to the things that 
it reflects, it follows that the rev- 
olution Harlan speaks of has been 
pre-existing within the writers he 
brings us here, is going on in the * 
field in which these writers work 
— in fact, is going on in the large 
world of which science-fiction is 
an intrinsic part — and may very 
well be going on inside you. 

Did you know? 

np»he immediately above is not 
-*■ as cute a question as it may 
at first glance seem. Harlan by 
habit and practice continually 
proclaims that he is blasting 

157 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



down the walls and smashing the 
barriers. This time he purports to 
have brought an entire wrecking 
crew with him. It is my theory 
that all of his hoohah about dy- 
namite and explosions is in fact 
Harlan’s way of saying gently: 
“Look out your windows.” If we 
take it like that, then what is it 
that waits for us outside our win- 
dows, and what is the vantage 
point from which we peek out 
through -them? 

The authors in this book would 
grace just about any table of con- 
tents they happened to appear 
upon. Lester del Rey, Robert 
Silverberg, Frederik Pohl, Philip 
Jose Fanner, Miriam Allen de- 
Ford, Robert Bloch, Brian W. 
Aldiss, a chap named Howard 
Rodman, which is called “The 
Niven, Fritz Leiber, Joe L. Hens- 
ley, Poul Anderson, David R. 
Bunch, a man named James 
Cross, a lady named Carol Emsh- 
willer, Damon Knight, Theodore 
Sturgeon, Larry Eisenberg, Henry 
Slesar, Sonya Dorman, a fellow 
named John T. Sladek, Jonathan 
Brand, Chris Neville, R. A. Laf- 
ferty, J. G. Ballard, John Brun- 
ner, Keith Laumer, Norman Spin- 
rad, Roger Zelazny, Samuel R. 
Delany and, somewhere in the 
middle but not least, Harlan Elli- 
son. 

That’s a hefty crew. Now one 
question one could usefully ask 
is what has brought them all to- 

158 



gether here, besides Harlan’s per- 
sistent energy? 

Well, to some, the reason is 
not connected with this book’s 
advance notices among sf writers. 
That would be James Cross and 
John T. Sladek. Their two stories 
were simply submitted by the 
authors’ literary agent when Har- 
lan got desperate for material. 
Cross’s “The Doll House” was 
written pretty much to one of 
Weird Tales’ formulas. Not that 
I think Cross decided to write a 
story to fit a market that’s been 
out of business for many many 
years. It’s just one of the standard 
fantasy notions, Cross did a pret- 
ty good job of writing it up, and 
when he was done he was finish- 
ed. This person is not in revolt. 

John T. Sladek doesn’t do a 
hell of a lot better in that wise. 
He says that the machine will 
reduce us all to ineffectual un- 
thinkers. Well, I hope not, but 
whether one hopes not or not 
this is not an exactly new idea, 
nor is it newly proposed, nor does 
it go to any new place. 

Harlan, standing back a little, 
would know that. He would also 
know that the story by Howard 
Rodman, which is called “The 
Man who Went to the Moon — 
Twice,” is a refiguration of Rob- 
ert Heinlein’s twenty-year-old 
story, “Columbus Was a Dope,” 
and that it is science fiction only 
by courtesy now, the same as it 

GALAXY 



was when Heinlein wrote it, but it 
isn’t by Heinlein, and it’s twenty 
years old. What it says, by the 
way, is that progress happens, 
but people find ways to make it 
commonplace. 

T think that’s a valid premise. I 
also think a lot of the cheaper 
rebellion in this book is created 
by a deliberate unawareness of 
progress, or an unwillingness to 
admit that progress can happen, 
because if progress can happen 
then one ought to be working a 
little bit harder to keep up with 
it or participate in it. It is much 
more pleasant simply to continue 
to spiral inward on the same old 
involution, the way Philip Jose 
Farmer does with “Riders of the 
Purple Wage.” If you are won- 
dering how it is possible to write 
more and more about less and 
less, Farmer can show you how 
to pile it higher and higher. From 
the first clue, of the free associa- 
tional title which will require 
some piece of blatant twisting 
somewhere in the story to justify 
it, to the last line, which by no 
means redeems the expenditure 
of thirty thousand words, this sa- 
tire on the father figure in Hein- 
lein’s stories, or this satire on 
Philip Jos6 Farmer, is the kind 
of exercise in self-indulgence you 
are going to get from some of the 
rebellious writers in our com- 
munity if you tell them that all 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



judgment will be suspended this 
one time. 

This process becomes even 
more obvious than it could have 
been. Each story is preceded by 
an editoral introduction, in which 
Harlan personalizes the daylights 
out of the author and his story. 
The story in turn is followed by 
an auctorial afterword, in which 
the author explains why he did 
what he just did. In some cases, 
you learn once more that the 
story now in your mind can not 
quite be what’s in the writer’s 
mind. In some cases, you learn 
that the writer is serious, thought- 
ful and educated. (You can also 
usually guess that from the sto- 
ry.) And in some cases, you can 
watch some pretty big people in- 
deed go crawling on their bellies 
like reptiles as they bend every- 
thing in sight to prove that they, 
they too, are “controversial,” 
while their stories give them the 
lie. 

And then we get “Faith of Our 
Fathers" by Philip K. Dick. This 
story is controversial as hell. It 
is controversial because the editor 
in his forward does everything in 
his power to make you believe 
that it is deliberately written 
while the author was up on drugs. 
A careful study of the wording 
indicates that he might not have 
been, which is just as well for his 
general welfare, I guess. But it 
is a fact, as some of you might 

159 



recall from The Three Stigmata 
of Palmer Eldritch, that Dick 
knows his hallucinogens very 
well, and that perhaps as a result 
of this he also writes very well 
about hallucinatory situations. In 
the case of Three Stigmata, su- 
perbly well; in the case of this 
story, he is somewhere beyond 
that point. 

He is to the point where he 
makes sense only to himself. This 
is a shame because the first three- 
quarters of this story appear to 
be very good. But if this is re- 
bellion — and I suppose it is — 
in fact, it certainly is — it is, 
again, involutional. 

it'T'he Jigsaw Man” by Larry 
Niven is an example of an- 
other kind of non-revolutionary 
revolutionary story — the one 
with the false basic premise. It 
says that if organ transplants turn 
out to be an effective therapeutic 
technique, then the demand will 
rise so high that we will begin 
legally killing people in great 
numbers in order to collect ma- 
terials to meet it. The death pen- 
alty, Niven says, might very well 
be applied in the end to a man 
who in the space of two years 
willfully drove through a total of 
six red lights and exceeded local 
speed limits .no less than ten 
times, once by as much as fifteen 
miles per hour. 

The story begins as a well writ- 

160 



ten hunk of action, has a number 
of emotionally effective moments, 
and winds up being almost purely 
polemical. Niven has told us an 
interesting story only up to the 
point where he had us hooked. 
Then he begins to lecture. His 
afterword takes off all the wraps 
and simply hammers away at 
these same points rather more en- 
ergetically. He seems to think 
that this terrible thing could hap- 
pen very soon. That it could real- 
ly happen. But it seems to me 
that for it to be happening in any 
foreseeable extension of our pres- 
ent culture, we would today have 
to be draining the blood of all 
those about to die anyhow — 
since there is a serious shortage of 
whole blood, plasma and other 
blood fractions. But we are not 
doing so. In the face of an urgent 
necessity, we are still bumbling 
along with the same old stupid, 
and sometimes lethal, sloppy col- 
lection system. 

It also seems to me that we 
should be doing something about 
making donation to “eye” and 
“ear” banks compulsory under 
certain circumstances. Too, in a 
very few more years, some re- 
spectable researchers predict and 
partly demonstrate, we will have 
beaten the sloughing problem, 
and therefore we ought to be 
stockpiling skin for grafts. We can 
use all the raw human bone we 
can get. But where are the charn- 

GALAXY 



el houses? No, in our culture you 
can kill ’em but you can’t eat ’em, 
and there is no sign that this is 
about to change. I think Niven 
looks a little ridiculous this time. 
It may be that he’s right, but 
there’s no sign of it within the 
context of his own work here, 
which is neither good lecture nor 
good story. 

( C F? utopia,” by Poul Anderson, 
telegraphs. It’s about one 
of the stock controversial subjects, 
and at first appears to have been 
well and thoughtfully written. 
But having telegraphed, it leaves 
itself free for examination as a 
hunk of story construction. And, 
as Fred Pohl said to me of one 
of mine in years past: ‘‘This is 
the kind of story in which the 
writer holds all the cards, and 
then he lays them down one at 
a time.” And this is true. I be- 
lieve this story is not written as 
well as Anderson would have 
handled a similar plot if he hadn’t 
had this college-controversial 
ending to look forward to. That’s 
a pretty tendentious judgment, 
because God knows what Ander- 
son would really have done. But 
off his record Anderson does bet- 
ter as a technician and as a story- 
teller when he is not also at- 
tempting to shock people. I think 
he could do best by contenting 
himself to lead people to think, as 
he has been doing for many years 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



now. That’s usually shock enough. 

But by now you are wondering 
why I told you to buy a book 
full of stories that I don’t hold 
with. Well, in the first place, I do 
hold with them, every one of 
them, even the bad ones, even the 
two(!) by David Bunch, because 
at least the appearance of this 
book indicates that there is some 
kind of ferment and that there 
are people willing to endorse it. 
We can take it as a matter of 
course that, like every revolution, 
this one has members who must 
be weeded out when success is 
achieved. But my other reason 
for telling you to buy this book 
is that it contains a number of 
extremely good stories. 

The best of them, the very 
best, one of the finest short stories 
I have ever read is “Sex and/or 
Mr. Morrison” by Carol Emsh- 
willer. It is a love story. It is not 
a story about any known form 
of physical sexual activity. It is 
a love story independent of the 
well known fact that there are 
two physical sexes. It is a story 
about love, pure, and the frus- 
tration and redemption that it of- 
fers. It is, though you might ar- 
gue, about little commonplace 
things that really do happen to 
you and me every day. “Sex 
and/or Mr. Morrison” is about 
the things that actually make 
things work. 

“If All Men Were Brothers, 



Would You Let One Marry Your 
Sister?” by Theodore Sturgeon, 
on the other hand, is about a very 
big subject. It’s about incest, and 
it is just plain terrible. It is a 
compendium of all the storytell- 
ing errors that Sturgeon avoided 
so brilliantly in writing Some of 
Your Blood. If he had to save 
them up someplace in order to 
write that latter novel, then read- 
ing this story is not too high a 
price to pay. But it’s interesting 
that Some of Your Blood is a 
straight novel, and it is here in 
the liberated “speculative fiction” 
format that Sturgeon falls down 
so badly. He falls down because 
he is not talking about the way 
the world is. He is talking about 
the way the world feels. And ac- 
tually he is talking about the way 
he says the world feels. Since he 
falls into the lecture form very 
soon, he is also trying to tell us 
what to do about the way the 
world feels. He is manipulating 
what he should be observing. And 
unfortunately for him, he is in 
the same book with “Sex and/or 
Mr. Morrison,” which if it is like 
anything that has gone before, is 
like Sturgeon. 

'T'here is a whole clutch of Sto- 
ries about God, as you might 
have expected. There is Lester 
del Rey’s “Evensong.” There is 
“Faith of Our Fathers.” There is 
a plain tale plainly told, “En- 

162 



counter With a Hick” by Jona- 
than Brand (and by extension in 
this same classification there is 
Fritz Leiber’s “Gonna Roll the 
Bones,” “Lord Randy, My Son” 
by Joe L. Hensley, and John 
Brunner’s sophomoric “Judas”). 

“Gonna Roll the Bones” and 
“Lord Randy, My Son” are both 
rather effective stories, outside 
the Judeo-Christian format, both 
strongly founded in folk beliefs. 
“Gonna Roll the Bones” has to 
do with the devil, gambling, wives 
and the hearth that is also a fur- 
nace, all good solid recurring 
symbols in folklore, and all very 
nicely utilized by Leiber in an 
effective and utterly noncontro- 
versial story. “Lord Randy, My 
Son” is about the neglected “re- 
tarded” child, whose psionic abil- 
ities are such that he is going to 
be most certainly a new Messiah. 

(Hensley, by the way, is made 
to sound like a boob and a boor 
in Ellison’s ingenuously affection- 
ate introduction. Hensley, a great 
gentleman, would never suggest 
to Harlan that his mouth has run 
away with him). 

The overt God stories are not 
so hot, even considering that Les- 
ter del Rey wrote “Evensong,” 
which is about the inherently in- 
credible situation in which God 
appears as the leading character 
in a science-fiction story. There 
are some stories that can’t be 
told, even when the author, editor 

GALAXY 



and publisher are all willing. Let 
Damon Knight, represented here 
by an old story out of his trunk, 
explain to you how this works: 

“The question asked in the 
story (‘Shall the Dust Praise 
Thee?’ in which Jehovah finds 
this message on a wasted Earth: 
‘We were here. Where were 
you?’) is a frivolous one to me, 
because I do not believe in Je- 
hovah, who strikes me as a most 
improbable person; but it seems 
to me for someone who believes, 
it’s an important question.” 

A If ost of the stories in this book 
-*■*-*■ serve only as examples. 
That’s okay, because some of 
them work — one or two of them, 
and that’s enough. Sturgeon con- 
tributes to the Emshwiller. 

It’s Kris Neville’s “From the 
Government Printing Office” that 
rounds out the book. Not that 
there aren’t some other good 
stories in it, many worth reading. 
The Neville just happens to touch 
on what this book, some of these 
stories, and what the whole “rev- 
olution” is about. You might call 
it “informational deprivation” or 
a “credibility gap” between this 
generation and the past. 

Not to put too fine a point on 
it, the Neville is about a time 
when kids are raised in accord- 
ance with a pedagogical program 
designed to create more scientists. 
This involves deliberate cruelty, 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



almost pathological misunder- 
standings and the withholding of 
honest answers; the fobbing off 
of fabrications such as folk-tales 
and folk-wisdom on the inquiring 
child, and the stunting of his at- 
tempts at self-expression. It also 
happens to be based on the re- 
sults of real biographical studies 
into the early lives of top re- 
searchers in our day. As a general 
thing, these studies tend to show, 
the people Who have made our 
world were made by what an- 
other day may well call mad- 
ness; before we have that other 
day, we might have a few inter- 
vening ones. (We get no answers, 
neither here, nor in anyone’s stud- 
ies, nor within ourselves, to such 
questions as whether a similar in- 
quiry into the childhood of the 
average working stiff, science- 
fiction writer or movie star would 
not reveal the same or similar 
madness. I think it might). 

There are some who say the 
problem has been brought to a 
peculiar point of acuity by the 
fact that we have now matured 
the first complete generation born 
into a world that could wink out, 
and knows it. I believe that, but 
it’s not important to the point 
here, which is that like all revolu- 
tions toward the future, this one 
is buried hip and thigh in the past 
... in the mad past, which gives 
birth to a mad new day.

THE WORLD 



Helpless, Thorinn watched his 
murderers end his life — and 
found a new one underground! 



Illustrated by ft 









Tn the days of King Alf, there 
was a house in windy Hoven- 
skar at the hub of the world, 
where the sky turns round the 
Pipe of Snorri. The house was of 
sods, with a stone roof, for no 
other sort of roof can stand 
against the winds that blow, this 



Hovenskar as the sky turns. 

Now Hovenskar is like a yellow 
bowl, and from one side of it to 
the other side is three days’ jour- 
ney. Long is the spoon with which 
the gods eat porridge from that 
bowl! To the north can be seen 
the half of Snorri’s Pipe, a gray- 
green column three leagues in 



165 





thickness, yet so tall that it seems 
to prick the sky like a needle; 
and around it the sky swings, 
half light and half dark. There- 
fore at high noon there is an eye 
of darkness peering over the rim 
of Hovenskar, and at midnight 
an eye of brightness. And the 
wind blows from the dark to the 
light, this way and that way over 
Hovenskar. 

In this unlucky place, in the 
days of King Alf, lived a man 
called Goryat and his three sons, 
who were outlaws driven out of 
Kjetsland. Goryat and the two 
elder sons were gray-skinned 
Lowlanders, four ells tall, with 
tusks like daggers; but the young- 
est son was pink as a Highland- 
man, and he stood no taller than 
Goryat’s belt-buckle. Nonethe- 
less he was sturdy and quick and 
could jump higher than his own 
head. Thus he was called Thor- 
inn, which is a kind of flea. 

Now it happened on the last 
day of King Alf (when a roof- 
tile dashed his brains out) that 
for thousands of leagues, even 
unto the land of the Skryllings, 
the earth became flat where it 
had formerly risen and arose 
where it had been flat. Rivers 
left their banks, lakes became 
marshes, the air was one black 
scream of birds, and everywhere 
cook-pots rolled out of kitchens, 
while the cooking wenches tum- 
bled after. 

166 



But of all this the four of Hov- 
enskar knew nothing. They knew 
only that Snorri’s Pipe had begun 
to roar, with a sound that thrum- 
med in the bones and could not 
be shut out, though they stopped 
their ears with their fingers; that 
their bodies had turned light, as 
in a dream; that there was an 
earth-shock that made men and 
horses dance on the ground like 
lice on a griddle, and that bits of 
the sky were falling like frost- 
flakes. 

Before they could gather their 
wits about them, one of the hors- 
es, a mare with foal, had broken 
her leg in the peat bog, and the 
rest were scattering up the high 
curve of the valley, from whence 
it was half a day’s work to drive 
them home again. 

\Tow this was a weighty matter. 

' It grew weightier still on the 
second day, when the other four 
mares went dry. Goryat took the 
finest of the remaining horses, a 
stallion of two summers, three 
ells high at the shoulder, and 
sacrificed him to Snorri. But the 
demon did not leave off roaring. 
Instead, as Goryat finished his 
prayers, there was a second earth- 
shock, and from the well nearby 
came the crack of stone breaking, 
and all the water ran away into 
the Underworld, leaving the well 
dry as a skull. 

Then the two elder sons urged 
GALAXY 



their father to leave Hovenskar 
and fare southward, but the old 
man, whose hand was still heavy 
though his mane had turned 
white as frost, would have none 
of it. “In all the Midworld there 
is no safety for me or those of 
my blood save in Hovenskar,” 
said Goryat to his sons. “Nor 
may Thorinn leave, for I have 
sworn by Wit and Bal to keep 
him.” Thus did the two sons learn 
from their father’s lips for the 
first time, though in truth it was 
plain to be seen, that Thorinn 
was no blood brother of theirs. 

“But if we sacrifice another 
horse, we may go empty-bellied 
through the winter,” said the eld- 
est son, whose name was With- 
inga. 

“Moreover, it’s plain enough 
that Snorri wants no horses.” 
Thus spoke the second son, whose 
name was Untha. “Is he the de- 
mon of waters, or not? When the 
horse was offered, he was vexed 
and broke our well.” 

“We must give him something 
better,” said Withinga. 

“Idle is boasting when the 
hands are empty,” Goryat an- 
swered. “What, must we fare to 
Skryllingsland and bring back a 
sacrifice?” 

“Not so far as that,” Withinga 
said. And he pointed his chin to- 
ward the hillside, where Thorinn 
was leading the horses to the 
nearest spring. 

THE WORLD AND THORINN 



Goryat said then, “Would you 
make me an oath-breaker? I tell 
you, I swore to keep the boy un- 
til Snorri takes him.” 

Untha rose and pointed at the 
black mouth of the well. “Then 
give him to Snorri.” 

So it was agreed. When Thor- 
inn came down, suspecting noth- 
ing, they said to him, “Go into 
the well, see whether it can be 
mended.” Then when he was in 
the well, they pulled up the 
bucket and covered the well- 
mouth with a great stone and 
prayed over it. 

'T'he Flea lay upon his back, 
-*• hands behind his head, one 
knee cocked over the other. The 
blades of the yellow grass formed 
a wall close around him, shield- 
ing his body from the wind that 
rustled overhead. Through half- 
shut eyes he could see the waver- 
ing patch of brightness that was 
the sky. Drowsy scents of grass 
and blossoms were in his nostrils, 
mingled with the faint but pun- 
gent smell of horse that clung to 
his leather garments. He could 
hear the stiff grass-blades crack- 
ling as insects crawled among 
them, the snort and stamp of the 
horses farther up the hillside and, 
more distantly, the unending 
drone of Snorri’s Pipe. 

Deliciously hidden and at ease, 
more than half asleep, he was 
daydreaming of distant moun- 

167 



tains and brightly dressed people, 
when a new sound roused him. 

He started up on one elbow 
and listened. There it came again. 
He pivoted with one hand on the 
matted grasses, sprang easily to 
his feet. Far below, over the thou- 
sand moving waves of yellow 
grass, he coud see Goryat’s stead- 
ing in the bright half of the valley 
— the house with its roof of gray 
stone and its thread of smoke 
bent by the wind, the horse barn, 
the meathouse, the tanyard, the 
well, all tiny as pebbles. Near the 
house a mannikin stood; its mane 
was only a dot of yellow. The 
arms were lifted; it shook a fist. 
After a second the hail came 
again: . oooTriii . 

Thorinn waved his arms in an- 
swer. The tiny figure below ges- 
tured with one hand, then turned 
away. It was already loping slow- 
ly toward the house when the 
sound arrived: . ooome dowww 

They had thought of some 
other task for him. That was 
only to be expected. 

Breathing the keen wind, Thor- 
inn forgot all disappointment as 
he raised his head. It was mid- 
morning. Where the tip of the 
Pipe touched the sky beyond the 
valley rim the dome was split by 
a clean arc that soared high over 
Thorinn’s head, dividing the sky 
into pale light and greenish dark- 
ness. Half the valley below was 
daylit. The other half lay still 
168 



in deep night, pricked here and 
there by the witchfires of fallen 
sky-stuff. Over in the peat-bog, 
wisps of night-mist were rising 
like ghosts; dew still sparkled in 
the grass along the daylight edge. 

As the day wore on, the arc 
in the sky would creep around 
the rim of the valley. One could 
almost see it move. Thorinn had 
lain many an hour on the wind- 
swept hill, watching it until, often 
as not, he fell fast asleep, and the 
horses roamed where they listed. 

Tits and fieldfares were busy 
in the cropped grass around the 
spring, quarreling and chirruping 
over the bits of grain they found 
in the horse droppings. Hawks 
were awheel over the high rim; 
but in the dark side, Thorinn 
knew, owls and nightjars were 
stirring. Northward from Hoven- 
skar, it was said, there were night 
creatures that never ventured in- 
to daylight, but followed the 
darkness eternally, around and 
around. Some day Thorinn would 
go ’and hunt them. Goryat would 
give him leave when he was a 
man. The world was good, though 
Snorri rumbled. 

Above him near the outcrop 
and the spring, the eleven giant 
horses turned their heads alertly. 
Thorinn filled his lungs and 
shouted. “Ho, Biter! Ho, Stone- 
head!” The horses snorted and 
tossed their manes; Stonehead, 
the old stallion, showed his wick- 

GALAXY 



ed span-long teeth. Thorinn 
bent his knees, leaped over the 
grasstops, came down two ells 
higher on the slope, leaped again. 
The horses, pretending fright, 
wheeled and lumbered away. 
Thorinn’s legs pumped furiously; 
he bounded, leaped like a grass- 
hopper after the soaring horses. 
He passed two stragglers, nervous 
young colts. The earth trembled, 
bouncing him higher. Blood burn- 
ed in his veins; the wind whipped 
his cheeks, made his eyes smart 
with tears. Head down, his mas- 
sive hindquarters bunching like 
fists, old Stonehead flew before. 
Stones and clots of turf spattered 
Thorinn like hail. He was flying, 
lungs afire. Into — the yellow — 
sea — and out. Ahead the stall- 
ion’s round eye glinted. The old 
horse turned, laboring up-slope. 
In two breaths Thorinn was be- 
side him; a final leap, and the 
rough mane was against his face, 
his arms and legs gripping the 
shaggy neck, while the world 
wheeled. 

'ITTinded and utterly happy, 
^ ’ Thorinn clung to the stal- 
lion’s neck. After a plunge or 
two, earth and sky steadied 
around him. Obedient to his will, 
the old stallion, who could have 
flung him five ells and broken his 
back if he chose, stood snorting 
and trembling. Thorinn reached 
up, grasped a thick hairy ear at 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



the root, pulled gently. The stal- 
lion dipped his huge head, turned 
and sprang. 

The other horses, standing at 
gaze a few hundred ells away, 
fell upward into distance. The 
steep yellow bowl of the valley 
came plunging up, the wind 
whined in his ears — down, with 
a bone-breaking jolt, another 
leap — down, another. Bounding 
below, the tiny shapes of the 
houses grew larger with each 
dizzy arc. The stallion’s neck 
strained against Thorinn’s cheek; 
they were flying like the wind; 
they would leap and never come 
down! 

The slope grew shallow; the 
hillside was behind them and the 
gray figure beside it. Thorinn re- 
cognized Withinga, tall as the 
house-eaves, in his stained leather 
jerkin and his belt studded with 
span-wide metal bosses. 

Obedient to Thorinn’s touch, 
Stonehead planted his hooves and 
slid to a bone-jarring halt. While 
Withinga watched sourly, Thor- 
inn vaulted to the ground, slap- 
ped the old stallion’s rump. 
Stonehead snorted, wheeled and 
bounded away toward the distant 
shapes of the other horses high 
on the hill. 

“Do you want to break your 
neck, Flea?” Withinga asked, 
taking a ponderous stride for- 
ward. 

“When Snorri calls, man must 

169 



answer,” said Thorinn. He step- 
ped back, half expecting a blow, 
but Withinga only stared at him 
for a moment, then said: ‘‘So it 
is. Come, the Old Man has a 
task for you.” 

Thorinn followed him around 
the moss-grown sods of the house. 
Under the weight of die roof, the 
sod walls had bulged year by 
year until the house lost all its 
squareness and was shaped like 
a cheese. In the dooryard beyond, 
Untha and old Goryat squatted 
at the well-curb, beside the emp- 
ty leather horse-trough. They 
looked up as Withinga and Thor- 
inn approached. Untha, who had 
been scratching the bare earth 
idly with his dagger, gaped wit- 
lessly, showing tusks as long as 
Thorinn’s thumb. His narrow 
blue eyes, slitted like a goat’s, 
stared at Thorinn as if he were 
a stranger. 

Without speaking, Withinga 
sank down beside the other two. 
Squatting in a row, the three star- 
ed at Thorinn. Their massive, 
yellow-maned heads were on a 
level with his. Beyond them, the 
split sky arched over the rim of 
Hovenskar. At last Goryat spoke. 
“The well is broken.” 

“Did you call me down here 
to tell me that?” asked Thorinn 
in honest surprise. 

“Hold your tongue and listen,” 
said Goryat. “It comes to my 
mind that the well may be mend- 
170 



ed. Therefore, jump into it and 
see.” 

Thorinn hopped to the well- 
curb and looked down. The deep 
shaft receded into darkness, past 
the leather thong and the dim 
round shape of the bucket. He 
could not see the bottom. 

“How shall we mend it?” he 
asked. 

“With stones,” grunted With- 
inga. “The fool asks; wise men 
must answer. Go down, Flea.” 

'nphorinn bent toward the dark 
*■ receding shaft, from which a 
faint cool breath arose; then a 
new thought struck him. “If this 
should be long in the doing,” he 
said, “who will cook the dinner?” 

The two brothers glanced at 
each other again, and Withinga 
stroked his chin with a taloned 
gray hand. “Well asked,” he said 
grudgingly. “Also, who will fetch 
peat for the fire and tend the 
horses?” 

“And milk the mares, suppos- 
ing they turn fresh again, and 
make cheese?” put in Untha, 
scowling and toying with his dag- 
ger. “That is no work for a man.” 

Thorinn stared from one to 
the other, for their words made 
little sense; but Goryat said, 
“Peace,” and gave them a hard 
look under his frosty brows. “Wit- 
lings have I for sons. The thing 
is decided.” He turned to Thor- 
inn. “Down with you, be quick.” 

GALAXY 



The three pairs of cold blue 
eyes were watching him. Thorinn 
hesitated uneasily; but Goryat’s 
brows were drawing together in 
a way he knew. He shrugged, 
bent and picked up the bucket 
thong. He tugged at the end of 
it, where it was knotted around 
one of the stones of the curb, 
found it secure, and backed over 
the rim of the well-mouth, lower- 
ing himself hand under hand. The 
three yellow-maned heads turned 
to watch him. They disappeared 
over the rim of the well, but a 
moment later, as he descended, 
they came back into view, peer- 
ing down. The three silhouetted 
figures seemed to rise and become 
foreshortened; the horizon sank; 
the ground bulged upward like 
water closing over his head. Clods 
and an occasional pebble, scraped 
loose by his feet, rebounded be- 
low. After a moment or two he 
heard something strike the bot- 
tom. Cold air breathed up past 
him. The edge of the leather 
bucket touched his thighs. Hold- 
ing the thong with one hand, he 
pulled the bucket up free of his 
legs, hung a moment and drop- 
ped. 

He was aware, as he fell, that 
his fall was unnaturally slow. 
That was because of the weight- 
loss that had come when Snorri 
began to rumble. The difference 
was not much, the tenth part per- 
haps of his eighty pounds, but 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



why should the sound of Snorri 
have taken away even an ounce? 
They four had all had to learn 
to walk over again, for their steps 
were so long that they tripped 
and bloodied their noses. The 
horses also. And it was comical 
to watch, the birds had not learn- 
ed even yet — their wing-thrash- 
ing when they tried to land car- 
ried them into the air again, over 
and over, and when they did fi- 
nally succeed in reaching the 
ground, they bounced and rolled, 
squawking, wings disheveled, then 
staggered to their feet, looking 
thunderstruck .... 

The bottom was near. Dimly 
he saw it, bent his knees, took 
the shock. But the bottom of the 
well was tipped beyond his ex- 
pectation, and it threw him 
against the side, making his head 
ring. 

TTe straightened himself and 
-*• breathed deep. How cold it 
was down here! And no wonder, 
for the water they got from the 
well, before it went dry, had been 
cold as ice. That was natural, for 
the deeper you went, the farther 
from the warmth-giving sky. 
Thus it was colder here on the 
floor of the ancient ocean than it 
was in the Highlands; colder 
again at the bottom of the well; 
and if you could dig deeper still 
into the earth, eventually you 
would come to the land of eternal 

171 



ice, the Underworld, where Snorri 
ruled. 

Thorinn crouched and felt for 
the source of the steady slow cur- 
rent that breathed up around his 
legs. Oddly, although the air was 
cool, it seemed warmer if any- 
thing than the earth and stones 
around him. His hands found an 
opening, half choked with mud. 
So far as he could tell, there had 
been a breaking of the rock table 
under the well, and he was now 
crouching on a tilted slab of it 
that had fallen and stuck. 

He heard a sound, twisted to 
look up. The mouth of the well 
was a disk of brightness, sur- 
rounded by concentric half-circles 
of gray reflected light. The sound 
was repeated, and Thorinn saw 
a tiny black dot rise to the well- 
mouth, bob and disappear. 

For a moment he could not 
believe it; then he stood hastily 
and shouted, “Hi! Don’t pull up 
the bucket! How am I to get up?” 

A maned head appeared, in 
silhouette against the sky, and 
looked down at him silently. It 
vanished; another appeared at a 
different place; then it, too, was 
gone. “Hi!” shouted Thorinn, 
hearing his voice boom up the 
shaft. 

He listened. Over the slow sigh- 
ing of the wind, a sound so famil- 
iar in Hovenskar that it was only 
when it changed, he caught the 
grumbling voice of Goryat. 

172 



“Lift your end! And hurry up.” 

Footsteps scraped on the peb- 
bles beside the well-curb. Then 
something dark came into view 
and hung suspended in the mid- 
dle of the disk. The broken circle 
of brightness around it flickered 
and vanished, the light down the 
well-walls turned gray and went 
out. A stony clang echoed down. 
The black air pressed close to 
Thorinn’s eyes and seemed as 
heavy to breathe as water. There 
was a long pause, then another 
clang. 

Thorinn’s heart was leaping 
with fear, but he reached for his 
wallet calmly enough, found the 
wooden light-box and uncovered 
the window of mica at one end. 
The pale witchfire of the sky- 
stuff inside brought his arms back 
in ghostly dimness, and a vague 
circle of dirt wall. But though he 
shielded it with his hand, it would 
not reach the top of the shaft — 
no, nor even four ells above his 
head, where the leather bucket 
ought to be hanging on its thong, 
waiting for him to jump and 
catch it and pull himself back to 
the surface. 

He waited, saying to himself, 
“It was a joke,” but in his belly 
he knew better. Not for any 
prank would glum Goryat or his 
lazy sons have lifted those two 
great stones, the broken slabs 
left over from the roofing, which 
had lain half-sunken in the earth 

GALAXY 



beside the house for as long as 
Thorinn could remember, and 
laid them one atop another across 
the mouth of the well. 

He listened. Dimly from above, 
vibrating through the slabs of 
stone, came the deep rising and 
falling tones of Goryat’s voice. 
Though he could not make out 
the words, the rhythm was famil- 
iar. What was it? Then he knew: 
the invocation to Snorri, the one 
Goryat had chanted when they 
had sacrificed the horse. 

It was neither joke nor mis- 
take; they meant him to remain 
in the well. 

II 

r I 'he knowledge of his own 
death came like icy water 
into Thorinn’s flesh. He leaned 
suddenly against the wall. All the 
things that had vaguely disturbed 
him before — the queer looks of 
Goryat and his sons, the odd 
things they had said — now be- 
came clear. 

The men of Hovenskar lived 
by their horses. For the mares to 
go dry was a disaster. A prudent 
man does not offend the gods, 
and therefore Goryat had sacri- 
ficed a stallion. When Snorri re- 
fused the gift, what more natural 
than to offer a man instead? 

But there had been no draw- 
ing of lots! The thing had been 
done by treachery; they had dealt 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 




with him like a stranger. Now he 
began to remember a thousand 
things: how they had always giv- 
en him the hardest tasks and the 
scraps from the kettle. He was 
no son or brother to them — only 
a beast to live or die at their will. 

The anger that flowed into him 
strengthened his limbs. Above, 
Goryat’s voice still rumbled dis- 
tantly through the stones over the 
well. He was not dead yet! He 
took a deep breath, another. The 
walls of earth around him were 
like a shirt laced too tight. He 
felt half smothered already, and 
yet he knew there was no lack 
of air. It was thirst that would 
kill him, and that would take 
days. To die of thirst in a well! 
Never mind, he had time, a pre- 
cious gift — three or four days, 
perhaps, before he grew too weak. 

What else? He had his short 
sword, really an old Yen-metal 
dagger of Goryat’s, in its leather 
scabbard; the broad leather belt 
it hung from, which might be use- 
ful in climbing; his wallet and 
its contents, which he now ex- 
amined — light-box, fire stick 
and tinder, a few crumbs of 
cheese, a strip of dried horse- 
meat and a few odds and ends, 
colored pebbles and the like, 
which he had picked up because 
he liked them. Then there were 
the clothes he wore, shirt and 
breeks of buckskin, horsehide 
shoes and the thongs that wrap- 



ped his calves. A rope of sorts 
might be made of all these things 
together. 

Thorinn shivered, staring up 
vainly into the darkness beyond 
his little light. Goryat’s distant 
voice paused, then began again. 
To climb the well would be no 
great matter, hands on one side 
and feet on the other, inching his 
way up to the top. But there 
were two things not to be for- 
gotten. 

The first, that if hand or foot 
slipped, he would fall and crush 
his bones at the bottom. Then, if 
the fall should not kill him out- 
right, his dying would be hard. 

The second, that even if he 
reached the top safely, he could 
neither lift the stones nor dig 
under them as he lay across the 
well. He must think of a way to 
make a sort of plaform near the 
top, on which he could stand 
while he dug with his sword .... 

But at this thought, he saw 
how hopeless his position was. 
For he had nothing to make such 
a platform of except the sword 
itself. 

C old and discouraged, Thorinn 
sat down on the floor of the 
well and hugged his knees for 
warmth. In the glow of the light- 
box, which he had placed on a 
stone beside him, he saw a sud- 
den flutter in the air. Something 
small and gray had darted up 



174 



GALAXY 



zigzag to vanish in the darkness. 

Thorinn stared upward, mouth 
open, then snatched the light and 
raised it over his head. 

At first he saw nothing. Then 
a small gray creature detached 
itself from the wall, spread a pair 
of membranous wings, and 
swooped erratically to the other 
side. It was a wingmouse, one of 
the darkness-loving creatures that 
sometimes flew out of the cave 
on the valley slope two leagues 
above. Where had it come from? 

He turned the light on the 
opening at his feet. This was a 
narrow black gash at the side of 
the well, no more than a span in 
width. But he saw dimly now that 
it widened below, undercutting 
the wall. 

Kneeling with his forehead 
pressed against the mud and peb- 
bles, he was able to see a shelf 
of muddy earth a few ells below. 
It did not extend all the way 
under the opening, however, for 
he could just make out an edge 
of blackness on the near side — 
a second deeper hole. Twisting, 
he put his arm down as far as it 
would reach. He groped in every 
direction, without finding any 
other obstruction. Mud and peb- 
bles, dislodged by his arm, cas- 
caded slowly down into the dark- 
ness. The current of moist air 
was feeble but steady against his 
fingers; it seemed to rise straight 
toward him. 

THE WORLD AND THORINN 



Thorinn sat up, feeling his 
heart beat. Who cannot ride must 
walk, as the saying was. If he 
could not go up, perhaps he could 
go down! If he could somehow 
reach the cave of the wingmice, 
and get out to the surface again 
.... let Goryat and his sons 
beware. 

He pulled out his sword, jabbed 
the point into the lip of earth 
over the opening. A wedge of 
dirt and stones came away and 
drifted down into the darkness; 
he listened, but did not hear it 
land. He pried loose another 
wedge, and another. When he 
had carved away enough of the 
shaft wall to admit his body, he 
paused and again looked down. 
This time, in the dim glow of the 
light-box, he could see a tumbled 
mass of muddy earth and stone, 
sloping downward like a funnel 
to a round black hole almost 
directly below him. 

After a moment’s thought, 
Thorinn unwrapped the thong 
from one leg of his breeks and 
tied it securely around the light- 
box. Kneeling again over the 
hole, he carefully lowered the 
box and swung it gently, until 
it was clear of the hole below, 
before he let it drop. He coiled 
up the thong and tossed it in 
after the box. 

Tn darkness now except for the 
•* glow that came up through the 

175 



hole in the well-bottom, he stood 
and listened. Goryat’s voice still 
rumbled overhead. He stared up- 
ward a moment silently in the 
darkness. Then he turned and 
lowered himself feet first into the 
hole. 

He hung for an instant with his 
chest and elbows on the lip of 
the opening, then let himself 
slide. As he floated down, he 
kicked forward, then back, 
strongly, at the moment his 
hands touched the lip. He 
straightened his body as he fell, 
landed easily on the slope be- 
side the second hole. 

A few bits of mud and gravel 
that had fallen along with him 
went pattering down the shaft 
below. Thorinn picked up his 
light-box and looked around. He 
was in a cavern with sloping 
walls, an irregular ceiling and 
floor, the whole splashed with 
mud in fantastic shapes. It was 
tall enough and to spare for him 
to stand erect here, but it rose 
and grew shallower in every di- 
rection. He could no longer hear 
Goryat’s voice. 

Holding the light-box, he lean- 
ed over and looked down. Cool 
air blew steadily and slowly in 
his face. The shaft, like a smaller 
well, dropped almost straight for 
perhaps five or six ells; then it 
seemed to curve slightly. Thor- 
inn saw the gleam of exposed 
stone at the lip and below that, 
176 



at no great distance, a faintly 
visible surface of which he could 
make out no details. 

Thorinn hesitated, not liking 
the look of this second descent. 
But the flow of air decided him. 
He unwrapped the thong from his 
other leg, tied it to its fellow: this 
gave him a rope nearly four ells 
in length. To this he added his 
belt for another ell. 

He lowered the light-box care- 
fully and this time had to lean 
down with his arm at full stretch 
before he saw the box touch bot- 
tom. It was mud and stones 
down there as well. He could see 
no more than that. He let the 
thong drop, watched it fall in 
coils below. 

He was too cautious to drop 
the sword. Instead, he held it flat 
to his thigh as he stepped off and 
fell, slowly at first, then faster, 
braking his descent a little with 
elbows and feet. He brought his 
feet together at the right moment, 
landed on the curving jut of rock 
at the lip. Pebbles and dirt rat- 
tled slowly down past him. He 
stood, turned lowered himself the 
small remaining distance. Crouch- 
ing, for there was no headroom 
here, he picked up the light-box 
and carefully brushed away the 
clods and gravel that had fallen 
on it. Then he looked around. 
The low dirt ceiling, porous and 
stained reddish-brown in places, 
formed an irregular dome; this 

GALAXY 



cavern was long and narrow. 
Here, too, ceiling, walls and floor 
were mud-splashed. Stones bigger 
than his head lay as if tossed 
about. The mound of mud and 
stones on which he crouched 
sloped away, channeled and rut- 
ted. In one direction it disappear- 
ed under a great tilted stone, 
leaving an opening no more than 
a span high; in the other across 
a wide pit which had drawn off 
the water like a funnel, the cav- 
ern stretched away level into the 
darkness. 

'T'horinn methodically wrapped 
the thongs around his calves 
again, cleaned his belt as well 
as he could and put it on, then 
hung his sword from it. Crouch- 
ing low on the slope, he wet his 
finger and held it first over the 
pit, then as far as he could reach 
toward the far end of the cavern. 
There was a current of air from 
both directions, though that from 
the pit was the stronger. Thorinn 
had no wish to go deeper, so he 
straddled the pit, clambered over 
and began inching his way along 
the level passage. 

After he had gone a few ells, 
the passage widened and the floor 
began to drop away sharply. The 
ceiling at first dipped down over- 
head as he descended, forcing 
him to crouch even more: then 
it leveled out abruptly, and he 
found himself able to stand erect. 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



Just over his head, tongues of 
some crusty reddish material 
hung from the ceiling. Thorinn 
tugged at one curiously and 
found that it was metal, rusted 
so thin that it broke in his hand. 
Below, the tunneled mound grew 
shallower and seemed to end in 
a level floor, with a few scattered 
boulders. 

Thorinn moved downward 
again. Here ceiling and walls 
formed one almost unbroken 
curve; it was as if he were in the 
bore of some giant earthworm, 
filled in with earth to half its 
depth. 

As he moved forward, the 
patches of rusty metal overhead 
grew larger and closer together, 
and he recognized others, twisted 
and broken, among the heaped 
earth and stones at his feet. Far- 
ther away, the arched roof of the 
tunnel glinted silvery through the 
rust. Thorinn moved along one 
wall, examining it as he went, 
and at last stopped in incredulous 
wonder. Between the dots and 
patches of rust, wall and floor 
alike gleamed with the silver- 
gray luster. The tunnel was lined 
with Yen-metal, the incorrupti- 
ble. Yet it had rusted away to 
nothing in places! How long had 
it been here, empty and unknown 
under the earth? 

The hair on the back of his 
neck began to prickle. He turned, 
swinging the light-box around. 

177 



Something hunched and gray 
darted behind a stone. The long 
shadow swallowed it. 

Thorinn cast the light this way 
and that, but saw nothing more. 
His heart was knocking in his 
chest. He held his breath, heard 
nothing. The thing he had glimp- 
sed had been half the size of a 
man, coarse-furred, running low 
to the ground. 

Thinking hard, he walked on 
a few paces, then paused and laid 
the light-box down. He dropped 
to one knee, as if examining the 
thong around his calf. His fingers 
plucked the knot loose; holding 
the thong in one hand, he seized 
the light-box in the other and 
pivoted. 

Another gray-furred shape 
darted behind a stone. This time 
it had been nearer. 

Thorinn clenched his teeth to 
stop his jaw’s trembling. Inside, 
he felt calm and cold; it was his 
body that was afraid. Holding 
the light-box under one arm, he 
made a sliding-knot in one end 
of the thong. 

This was an extremely danger- 
ous moment, for both hands were 
occupied as he fastened the light- 
box to his forearm. He made a 
second loop at the other end of 
the box, drew it tight, tested it 
and found it firm. 

He swung the light around 
again, turning as he walked, but 
saw nothing. 

178 



TTe realized abruptly that his 
ears, tuned to the faint slith- 
ers and squeaks around him, for 
some time had been hearing an- 
other sound: the distant, steady 
rush of water. He raised the light- 
box awkwardly head-high, but 
there was nothing in that direc- 
tion, only the tumbled waste of 
earth, stones and rubble. 

He followed the sound, hoping 
for some advantage from any 
change. The current of air grew 
stronger, the water sound louder. 
Dancing ahead, at last the glow 
of the light-box picked up a pale 
gleam in the earth. It was the 
far side of a great hole, ten ells 
across, that went down out of 
sight in undulating level stripes 
of brown and cream-colored 
stone. 

It was not the place he would 
have chosen; but at least, if he 
stood with the chasm at his back, 
the beasts could not attack from 
behind. He went closer, feeling 
uneasy. This might be the river 
Dan that disappeared into the 
ground three leagues from Gory- 
at’s steading; or perhaps it was 
the water that had escaped from 
the well, now rushing here under- 
ground toward some deeper 
chasm .... 

He stepped cautiously up to 
the lip, cast his light this way and 
that, then tilted it down and 
risked a glance. Deep down, be- 
yond the smooth-cut lip of stone, 

GALAXY 



the water rushed by smooth and 
fast. His light was too feeble to 
show more than the surface, but 
he knew that it was deep. The 
sound that came up out of the 
hole was partly the whispering 
rush of water, partly something 
else — a distant, hollow roar. He 
realized the sound had grown so 
loud that it might be difficult to 
hear any stealthy noises behind 
him. 

He turned, sweeping the light 
around, just in time to see a dark 
shape spread-eagled in the air 
before him. He saw the sharp 
snout, the pinkish-gray inside of 
the mouth gaping behind the long 
teeth, the outstretched dirty 
hands like a man’s. He struck 
clumsily with his sword, felt the 
jolt in his wrist, heard the thing 
shriek like a gutted horse. Two 
more were leaping at him from 
left and right. He stumbled back- 
ward, swinging wildly — the 
sword-tip touched one of the 
beasts in mid-leap, and there was 
another scream. 

Two hard bodies struck him, 
and he was down on his back, 
rolling, breathing their moldy 
stench. Cold pain slashed his 
cheek and arms. He realized dim- 
ly that it could happen; one could 
be killed, without time for more 
surprise than this .... A sharper 
pain stabbed his breast, making 
him cry out. His free hand was 
on the creature’s coarse-furred 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



throat, forcing it back, and in the 
stifled glow of the light-box he 
saw the snarling mouth with its 
tongue like a dry worm, the 
round, eyeless head. Then the 
stones under him dropped away, 
and he was falling. 

Below him the water roared. 

Ill 

T t was the distant, roaring of the 

water that brought him up out 
of darkness. He was sprawled on 
wet stone, retching feebly. His 
legs were still in the water, which 
lapped at his middle rhythmically 
and insistently, over and over in 
the same place. When he tried 
to crawl out of its reach, he 
found his legs too heavy to move. 
He belched up a watery surge of 
vomit against the stone. After a 
while, groaning, he managed to 
drag himself an ell or so away 
from the water and roll onto his 
back. 

The light-box was still clinging 
to his arm, but its glow was so 
feeble that he could barely make 
it out. When he looked up, the 
darkness pressed close against his 
open eyes. The sound of the 
water roared endlessly, off in the 
distance. The sound was hollow, 
echoing. 

He started, remembering 
coarse-furred stinking bodies, 
stabbing teeth ... his hand went 
to the pain in his breast and 

179 



found the leather shirt pierced as 
if by needles. He could remember 
the water plunging up over his 
head, the helpless motion, the 
falling .... 

His right hand lay empty 
against the stone. The sword was 
gone, of course. 

After an interval, some faint 
sound in the darkness brought 
him struggling up on one elbow. 
He listened with shock trembling 
along his nerves, but the sound 
was not repeated; he heard only 
the steady, tumultuous roaring 
of the water. 

On his right cheekbone there 
was a lump of a thumb’s thick- 
ness. Three deep slashes, still 
welling blood, curved down his 
cheek and neck. The pain in his 
breast was as sharp as if the 
needle-teeth still gripped him 
there, and he found himself run- 
ning his fingers over the pierced 
leather to reassure himself. 

A touch told him that the light- 
box was ruined. One end was 
split, the mica missing and all 
the sky-stuff washed out of the 
compartment except a few shreds 
clinging to the soaked wood. The 
dim glow came from these. 

The knots in the wet thong 
were too much for his fingers. At 
length he attacked them with his 
teeth, jerking at them with des- 
perate stubbornness until they 
loosened enough to slip the light- 
box free. Holding it with care in 
1B0 



both hands, he pried the wooden 
cap off the other end. The mica 
here was still whole. 

He unlatched the lid, raised it 
and probed delicately in the sec- 
ond compartment. It was half 
full of chill water, in which he 
could feel the sodden sky-stuff 
afloat. 

Thorinn let out the breath he 
had been holding. He fumbled 
over the stone with his free hand 
until he found a hollow place. 
He tilted the box over it, pressing 
the skystuff against the inside of 
the compartment and straining 
the water out between his fingers. 

He remembered that he must 
put aside a portion of the dark 
sky-stuff. He unfastened his wal- 
let and tipped the water out of 
it, then pinched up a good lump 
of sky-stuff between thumb and 
finger, and laid it carefully at the 
bottom of the wallet. 

Now, if there was enough of the 
bright sky-stuff left .... Thorinn 
scraped the inside of the ruined 
compartment with his forefinger, 
brought it up with the fingernail 
dimly glowing, and touched it 
firmly to the sodden mass of 
sky-stuff in the other half of the 
box. The moss bloomed into pale 
light, dim but beautiful to his 
eyes. 

H e shut the lid carefully upon 
it, then aimed the mica end 
of the box this way and that 

GALAXY 



around him. He was sitting on 
a smooth flat rock that sloped 
gently down to the water and 
ran away featureless into the 
darkness on every other side. 

Now that he had light, his first 
care was to recover the few 
strands of sky-stuff that had es- 
caped between his fingers when 
he poured the water out. He dip- 
ped them up out of the puddle 
one by one, dried them as best 
he could by shaking them gently 
and deposited them in the box 
again. 

Next he thought of his hurts. 
Dark sky-stuff, moistened and 
bound to a wound, was said to 
be healing; but he had none to 
spare, nor any other medicines. 

He climbed stiffly to his feet. 
His sopping garments clung to 
him. His shoes squelched when 
he took a step. Even his hair 
dripped cold down the back of 
his neck. He turned toward the 
distant roaring sound and slowly 
began to %valk along the edge of 
the water, holding the light-box 
ahead of him. 

After ten steps a black wall of 
rock gleamed out of the darkness. 
It went nearly to the water and 
rose overhead farther than his 
little light would reach. He turn- 
ed away from the water, up the 
slope. After a few steps the stone 
on which he had been walking 
ended and gave way to other 
slabs, more uneven, higher and 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



of a smaller size, while the wall 
curved gradually back, away 
from the roaring sound, until it 
ran parallel with the water. 

In thirty paces more, Thorinn 
came to a head-high shelf on 
which some leathery fans of fun- 
gus grew. He pulled them down, 
found them white and doughy 
inside, with a strong stale odor. 
He nibbled at one, found it palat- 
able and then, such was his hun- • 
ger, ate all the rest and looked 
for more. But he found no others 
of that size, only a mass of larger 
ones joined together in long rows, 
dead and just as hard as spear- 
wood. 

He turned away in disappoint- 
ment, but after a moment, think- 
ing better of it, went back and 
broke loose some of the dead 
fungus. It came away in a long 
staff, like a loaf of bread. He ex- 
amined the inner surface closely 
in the glow of the light-box. It 
was porous and tinder-dry. In- 
sects had tunneled through it, 
leaving portions of the mass so 
eaten away that they collapsed 
under his thumb. 

Thorinn felt a spark of excite- 
ment. He knelt on the cold stone, 
opened his wallet and got out 
his fire stick. The tinder was a 
sodden mass of fiber. Thorinn un- 
tied it and spread it out on the 
stone; it might dry enough to be 
of use, he supposed, but it would ’ 
take days. 

18 T ! 




H e dried his hands as well as 
he could by rubbing them 
along the rock, then picked up 
the staff of fungus again and be- 
gan to break off small pieces. But 
his touch dampened them in spite 
of all he could do, and at last 
he broke the staff into two parts 
and began rubbing the ends to- 
gether to grind off chunks and 
fragments. When he had a pile 
of these, he laid the rest of the 
fungus aside and picked up his 
fire stick. Like everything else 
he owned it was wet, but the 
plunger still slid freely enough 
in the cylinder. Thorinn took it 
apart and shook a few drops of 
moisture out of it. Then, holding 
it braced against the stone be- 
tween his legs, he sat patiently 
driving the plunger in, over and 
over, until the cylinder grew 
warm to the touch and the inside 
was dry. 

He opened the fire stick then, 
wedged the cylinder upright into 
a crack in the stone and used two 
shreds of fungus like fingers to 
pick up other shreds, preserving 
their dryness, and drop them into 
the fire stick. He put the plunger 
in, drove it down smartly, re- 
moved it. The shreds of fungus 
were glowing bright orange. 

He tipped them out carefully 
into a pile of the finest fragments 
and dust of the fungus. They 
glowed for a moment more, then 
went out. 

GALAXY 




On the third try, the little fire 
caught. Thorinn protected it with 
his cupped hands, blew gently 
on it, fed it sparingly with tiny 
splinters, then with bigger ones, 
and at last had whole chunks and 
staffs of fungus blazing yellow. 

The yellow light danced high, 
reflecting glints from the shelving 
rock wall for a distance of five 
or six ells, before it vanished into 
shadow. Peering up between his 
cupped hands, Thorinn thought 
he could make out a vague glim- 
mer that might be the ceiling, 
far overhead. 

He crouched to the fire, soak- 
ing up warmth greedily with 
hands and face, then stripped off 
his soaked clothing and stood 
near the flames, turning himself 
like meat on a spit until at length 
he was dry and warm. The blood 
that welled slowly from the 
wounds in his chest began to 
clot. 

Feeling stronger, Thorinn walk- 
ed along the wall of rock collect- 
ing more staffs of fungus, which 
he piled near the fire; then he 
turned his shirt and breeks in- 
side out and sat down to dry 
them. He emptied his wallet, put- 
ting the lump of sky-moss care- 
fully aside in a cranny of the 
rock and examining the rest of 
his belongings for the first time 
to make sure they were safe. He 
laid his possessions out carefully 
on the rock and propped the 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



wallet open to dry along with 
his shoes. 

'T''he leather of his shirt steamed 
and turned a lighter brown. 
He pulled it right side out again 
and put it on, then the breeks. 
They were not thoroughly dry, 
but they were warm inside. They 
would have to do. He chose a 
long, heavy staff of fungus, laid 
one end of it in the heart of the 
fire. His shoes were wet as ever, 
but he put them on, gathered his 
possessions into the wallet and 
hung it from his belt. 

By this time the end of the 
fungus staff was blazing, and he 
lifted it out of the fire. Yellow 
flames continued to curl around 
its tip, and when he held it over- 
head shading his eyes, it cast a 
ruddy light that made the cavern 
visible for a dozen ells or more 
on every side. 

The rock wall rose in one re- 
ceding shelf after another back 
into the shadows. Tipping his 
head back now, Thorinn could 
make out the broken rock surface 
of the cavern’s ceiling, dim in the 
distance. But although he walked 
down to the edge of the water 
and held the torch high, he could 
not see the other side — only the 
dark, glassy, faintly moving sur- 
face of the water and the dim 
slope of the bottom under it, 
shelving down into darkness. 

He turned away from the roar- 

183 



ing sound and followed the edge 
of the water in the other direc- 
tion. The rock wall curved closer, 
became broken and covered with 
gray nodules of fungus; the stone 
shelf underfoot narrowed until 
there was barely room to walk, 
then gave way to heaped boul- 
ders. The thunderous roaring re- 
ceded behind him, but another 
water-sound rose ahead. Holding 
his light out over the water, he 
saw the gleam of a swift current. 

Now the ceiling began to dip 
lower. Thorinn was picking his 
way from one water-rounded 
boulder to another at the foot of 
the sheer face of rock. The ceiling 
curved down, the shelf broadened 
out again into two flat stones . 
and between them the water ran 
in a curved dark torrent, brilliant 
as glass, into a narrow slot of 
darkness under the wall. 

On the other side of the outlet, 
the shelf broadened again, and 
behind it was a tumbled mass 
of boulders. Thorinn hesitated. 
The gap was only three ells 
across, half again his own height, 
but the thought of falling into 
that dark water made his knees 
turn weak. 

He screwed up his courage, 
leaped and landed safely. 

\ s well as he could judge, the 
cavern at this end was some 
twenty or thirty ells broad, and 
the ceiling might be as much as 

184 



thirty ells high in the center. On 
this side, the ceiling slanted 
sharply down to the talus slope 
of boulders at the base of which 
he stood. Fungi grew here and 
there on some of the larger stones. 
Thorinn picked all the smaller 
ones he saw, ate some and put 
the rest into his wallet. He found 
another long staff of dead fungus 
and tore it down for a spare 
torch. 

The roaring grew louder as he 
circled the lake. Out across the 
dark water, an orange spark leap- 
ed into view: it was his fire, on 
the other side. He watched it for 
what seemed like a long time, 
until it abruptly winked out 
again, and he realized he had 
passed the wall of rock that jut- 
ted out to the water. 

His torch was burning low. He 
paused to light the second one, 
and in its brighter flare, some- 
thing white and vast rose out of 
the darkness. 

The roaring filled the cavern 
now as he moved closer; it stuff- 
ed his ears with noise. He shouted 
and could not hear himself. The 
air was full of flying droplets, 
drifting in fairy arcs, winking and 
vanishing. The white water drop- 
ped thunderously into the lake, 
bursting into white mounds of 
spray. Thorinn could dimly make 
out the shapes of rocks like 
giants’ skulls behind the curtain 
of water. He could not see the 

GALAXY 



top of it, and his torch was smok- 
ing and dimming now as he tried 
to move nearer. The wet air was 
putting it out. Thorinn retreated 
until the torch burned brightly 
again, then began to climb the 
heaped boulders, working his way 
toward the waterfall. 

The air was less damp at this 
height, and he was able to ap- 
proach within twenty ells or so 
of the cataract. He was halfway 
up the cavern wall now, and the 
boulders would take him no 
higher. He raised the torch. The 
dim light glimmered back from 
a hole in the rocky ceiling, from 
which the torrent sprang out 
greenish-white and curved into 
space. 

One look, and he knew he could 
never get back up the way he 
had come down. 

IV 

A s he sat on a boulder, his eye 
was caught by a tiny glimmer 
of brightness under the dark 
water, far off toward the middle 
of the lake. He stared at it under 
his hand, and in a moment was 
almost sure that it was his lost 
sword. But it might as well have 
been at a thousand leagues’ dis- 
tance for all the good it was to 
him. Indeed, it seemed likely 
that he would never need it again. 

Weariness took him as he sat, 
and he began to think how good 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



it would be to lie and rest, near 
the fire for comfort, though in- 
deed, except for his wet shoes and 
breeks, he was comfortable 
enough. The air in this cavern 
was cool and fresh; there was no 
wind .... Here he began con- 
fusedly to imagine that the cavern 
had the ceaseless wind of Hoven- 
skar blowing through it and that 
the gray-maned horses were lift- 
ing their heads beyond Goryat’s 
stone-roofed house, which some- 
how was all mingled with the wall 
of the cavern, and the smoke as 
it rose from the smokehole lean- 
ing crooked in the air ... 

He came to himself with a 
start, to realize that he had all 
but dropped the smoldering torch 
out of his hand. The torch was 
half out, a black stub crawling 
with fire-worms. It’s thin, acrid 
smoke drifted aslant. 

Thorinn’s head rose to follow 
it. Indeed, since the air was fresh, 
there must be some way for it 
to come into the cavern! The two 
holes that he knew of were both 
filled by the moving water. 
Therefore there must be others. 

Stung to wakefulness, he rose 
and beagn to climb, following the 
dim path of the smoke from his 
torch. Questing along the top of 
the heap of boulders, in a few 
minutes he found a crevice in the 
wall into which a faint current 
of air was moving. But the crev- 
ice was no bigger than his fist. 

185 



His torch threatened to go out. 
He went looking for another, 
found it and took up the search 
again, working his way back the 
way he had come. He found two 
more crevices no larger than the 
first, then a fourth an ell in length 
but thinner than a finger. 

At the lower end of the cavern, 
where great slabs of the ceiling 
had fallen and lay heaped all 
anyhow, the thin smoke of his 
torch eddied and drifted. Stoop- 
ing to peer between two slabs, 
Thorinn felt cool air breathing 
on his face. He held the torch 
nearer, singeing his hair in his 
excitement. 

Behind the rock slabs, an irreg- 
ular passage ran away into the 
earth. It was two ells high to be- 
gin with and seemed to grow 
larger as it went. Thorinn put one 
arm in, tried to follow it with his 
head, but could not. 

He drew back, panting, and ex- 
amined the boulders. The smaller 
of the two was half buried by a 
clutter of other stones. The larger 
lay almost free on the slope, sup- 
ported only at its lower end by 
another slab. Thorinn got his fin- 
gers around the edge of the large 
stone, braced himself and pulled, 
without effect. He tried again, 
nearer the top, but it was no use. 
The stone weighed as much as 
a horse. 

He rested, feeling weak from 
hunger and exertion. The wounds 

186 



in his chest had opened and were 
bleeding again. If he only had a 
lever, a pole, anything, to pry 
the larger slab up and out, away 
from its support at the bottom! 

A thought came into his mind, 
but he pushed it aside. Never 
mind. Where there was one such 
passage there must be others. He 
smeared the stone with the stub 
of his old torch to mark it and 
patiently went on searching. He 
leaped the gap at the lake’s out- 
let, circled back to his starting 
point. 

His fire was gray ash and em- 
bers. He built it up again, then 
began to climb the terraces that 
sloped away behind. The rock 
wall here was full of promising 
oval shadows, but every one 
turned out to be no more than a 
niche in the rock. 

He made the whole circuit of 
the cavern once more before he 
was sure. 

There was no possible exit 
from the cavern except the one. 
He must somehow move that 
stone. 

TTe remembered his glimpse of 
-*• the sword, dim yellow under 
the water. If he could only get 
it back, that would be his lever. 
But the thought of going into 
that dark water turned him cold 
inside, and he pushed it away a 
second time. 

He prowled uselessly around 

GALAXY 



the heap of boulders for a while, 
then went down to the water’s 
edge and stared out over the 
black surface. The thought came 
back insistently. Lost in the dark- 
ness, the cataract roared. It had 
been roaring there, he supposed, 
since before he was bom, and 
would go on roaring long after 
he had left his bones beside the 
lake. 

Thorinn swallowed hard, turn- 
ed and walked toward the cata- 
ract, gathering dead fungus as 
he went. When the white moun- 
tains of spray showed in the light 
of his torch, he turned and began 
to climb. 

At the spot where the sword 
gleamed up at him from the bot- 
tom of the lake, he made a fire 
on the flat top of a boulder. He 
climbed down the slope a few ells, 
and made another fire; then he 
climbed up again to verify that 
the two fires, one behind an- 
other, pointed toward the sword 
in the lake. 

Grimly, thinking of the cold 
clasp of the water, he climbed 
down the slope and stood' at the 
lake. The water was as shallow 
here as on the other side, but it 
shelved away rapidly until within 
a few ells the light of his torch 
could no longer reach the bottom. 

Thorinn took off his shoes and 
breeks, then his belt and wallet, 
and laid them on a stone. The 
air was cool on his bare skin. He 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



stepped into the water, wincing. 
The stone was slippery. He took 
another step and was ankle-deep; 
another, calf -deep; another, cau- 
tiously, and his leg went in to the 
knee; there was no bottom under 
his foot. 

He staggered back, trying to 
turn. His foot went out from un- 
der him, and the cold water chok- 
ed off his yell. 

Smothered, gasping, he floun- 
dered up to shore again. He had 
tried to hold the torch above 
water as he fell, but the splash 
had put it out He was wet all 
over, as wet as he had been be- 
fore. 

Qome while later, hugging his 
'"-'misery, he sat staring out over 
the dark water. He had tried the 
other side and had found it as 
deep as this one. Another, more 
skilled or courageous than he, 
would have had the sword by 
now, while he must stay and die 
here for the want of it. 

The sword lay on the bottom, 
not more than fifteen ells from 
where he sat But it was too deep 
for wading; he could not swim; 
there was no boat, or anything to 
build one. If only the lake were 
solid rock .... 

Thorinn straightened and sat 
up. In his mind, he saw a level 
road of stones under the water, 
straight to where the sword lay. 
His heart bounded. He turned, 

187 



scanning the slope in the dim 
firelight for stones of a proper 
size. There were plenty of them, 
slabs level on top and bottom, 
about half an ell in thickness. 

The first three went easily 
enough; he laid them in a straight 
line out into the water, half an 
ell under the surface, so that 
when he walked on them, the 
water came only to his knees. 
The fourth was harder to carry. 
The fifth, though it was no bigger 
than the others, he could not 
even lift higher than his shanks. 
He staggered out with it never- 
theless, dropped it in place, lurch- 
ed back to shore. 

He rested, built up his two fires 
above on the slope and grimly 
went back to work. As the cause- 
way lengthened, instead of one 
stone he must put down two, one 
atop the other, to bring the top- 
most within half an ell of the 
surface. His first stones he had 
laid a span apart, but since he 
had begun to pile them one on 
another, each column must lean 
against the one before it, or it 
would fall. Even so, more than 
once the second stone slid off the 
first, either when he laid it down 
or when he tried to walk upon it. 

Then the bottom grew deeper 
still, and three stones in each col- 
umn were needed. Three times 
he tried to build a column of 
three stones, and three times it 
collapsed. Thorinn splashed back 
188 



to the shore cursing, and flung 
himself down on the cold stone 
trembling with weariness. But he 
got up again and laid two stones 
for a foundation, then one above, 
and a fourth stone on that. In 
this way he built another column, 
and another. 

'T'ime passed. The fires burnt 
-*• low, and he built them up 
again. Looking down from the 
height he could see his stone 
path straggling out into the water, 
less than halfway toward its goal. 

He lay down again to rest, 
dropped into exhausted sleep, 
and woke from dreams of eyeless 
goblins to find himself cold and 
in the dark. His fires had gone 
out. He collected fungus, drank 
a little water from the lake, re- 
lieved himself behind a boulder. 

The columns now must be four 
stones high: two stones, then two 
more above, then one, then one 
more. When he had built one 
such column of six stones, his 
arms were like lead, his breath 
burning his chest. It was impos- 
sible to go on. He lay cursing 
himself feebly, then got up and 
began another column. 

Now time had stopped, and 
there was only the pain of his 
labor. He counted the columns, 
and there were nineteen. The 
twentieth must be five stones 
high: he built it in courses of 
three stones, then two, then two, 

GALAXY 



then one, and one. So with the 
next, and the next. Each time he 
climbed the slope for more stones, 
he could look down at the cause- 
way and judge whether it was 
holding to the right direction or 
not. He slept and ate again. 

The twenty-sixth column was 
six courses tall — four stones, 
then three, three, two, two and 
one: fifteen stones, to advance 
his causeway the width of one 
stone. After another dazed inter- 
val, he counted the columns 
again, and there were twenty- 
nine. 

Thorinn trudged back along his 
underwater causeway. He pulled 
his torch out of a crevice, waded 
back out across the tops of the 
columns. He held the torch trem- 
bling over his head, peered down. 
There it was! Deep down, 
straight ahead, glimmering golden 
under the water. 

With tears of weakness start- 
ing from his eyes, Thorinn went 
back to shore, wedged the torch 
into its crevice again, climbed the 
slope for more rocks. He built his 
last column carefully — four 
stones, then four more, then three, 
three, three, two and two. The 
final course came above the sur- 
face of the water. Thorinn went 
back for a torch, wedged it in be- 
tween the two topmost stones, 
and he stared below. 

The sword gleamed up at him 
out of darkness as though it were 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



near enough to touch. He could 
see the wooden handle carved for 
a close grip, the dull place where 
the tang went into the hand- 
guard, the bright double edge. It 
lay on the smooth rock bottom 
among a few pebbles, waiting. 

Thorinn tied one end of his 
thong around one of the topmost 
stones, the other around his waist. 
His hands were like wood. He 
climbed gingerly down and 
around the last column, groping 
for footholds. The cold water 
stung his wounds. The water 
surged, lifted at his body, trying 
to upend and drown him. He 
clung desperately to the end of 
the causeway, pressed his cheek 
hard against the stone. What re- 
mained was such a little thing — 
to climb down another ell or so, 
take the sword, climb up again 
into the air. 

Thorinn filled his lungs, 
squeezed his eyes shut, lowered 
himself into the water. Water was 
in his eyes, his ears, blinding and 
deafening: the water lifted him, 
swung him helplessly while he 
struggled for his life. His hands 
found the thong. He pulled, came 
up choking and gasping. 

He climbed' up wearily and sat 
shivering on the end of the cause- 
way. 

Such a little thing — but he 
could not do it. In the torchlight, 
the sword gleamed up at him de- 
fiantly. 



189 



'T'he trouble was, perhaps, that 
he had tried to climb down 
the wall of stones as if it were 
in air, but the unfamiliar buoy- 
ancy of the water had tricked 
him and thrown him off balance. 
Then caution itself was his ene- 
my. He must throw himself bold- 
ly into the water, let himself sink 
to the bottom, trusting the thong 
— then take the sword and pull 
himself back to safety. 

It was harder to do it than to 
think of it. Twice he tried to 
throw himself off, twice his mus- 
cles refused him. At last he 
climbed down until the water was 
up to his chest, then closed his 
eyes as before and lunged for- 
ward. 

At once he found himself chok- 
ed, floundering, turning. He could 
neither sink nor rise. He pulled 
himself out again, coughing, 
spewing up water. 

He sat on his causeway and 
looked back at the length of it, 
dimly shining under water in the 
torchlight. What bitterness it 
would be to be defeated after 
such labors! But without the art 
of swimming, he could not move 
under water, even such a little 
distance. The treacherous stuff 
would not even let him sink. 

A thought came to him, and 
he stood up wearily, looking down 
at the stones of the causeway. He 
bent, seized one of them half un- 
der the water and hoisted it out, 
190 







grunting with effort. The wet 
stone weighed nearly as much as 
he did, and in his weakness he 
could barely hold it. Surely, if 
he threw himself into the water 
again, carrying such a stone in 
his arms, he must sink! 

He gave himself no time to 
consider. As he climbed awk- 
wardly around the last column, 
he slipped, felt himself falling. 
The water leaped past him. The 
stone was dragging him down; 
water was in his eyes, nose, ears 
. He felt a blow against his 
knuckles, knew he was on the 
bottom. His grip loosened and his 
body floated backward, but he 
seized the stone again. His lungs 
were bursting. He forced his eyes 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



open, saw a stinging blur, a 
gleam. Holding the stone with 
one hand, he reached out des- 
perately, felt his fingers close 
around wood and metal. 

Somehow he found the thong 
with his other hand, pulled, rose. 
He burst into air, breathed — 
he was alive! The sword, the 
sword — 

His heavy arm came up. And 
in his hand, streaming water, lay 
the bright metal. 

V 

T evered upward, the heavy 
-•—'slab trembled, moved a fin- 
ger’s breadth, then began to slide. 
Thorinn pulled the sword out of 

191 



the way and leaped back. Turn- 
ing majestically, the slab rumbled 
down the slope in a dancing cloud 
of smaller stones. It struck a 
boulder halfway down, tilted, 
came to rest. Stones pattered and 
fell silent. A haze of dust parti- 
cles hung in the air. 

Thorinn examined his sword 
anxiously, but the hard Yen-met- 
al had taken no hurt. The point 
was as sharp and straight as ever, 
and the double edge was not even 
nicked. 

Cool air breathed past him in- 
to the exposed passageway. In 
the light of the torch, it was 
curved, lusterless, smooth-walled, 
unequal in cross section — taper- 
ing almost to a point at ceiling 
and floor. It sloped gently up- 
ward out of sight. 

Thorinn turned for one last 
look out into the darkness of the 
cavern. He had slept, rested, eat- 
en all he could hold of the young 
fungus he had gathered. The rest 
— there was little enough — was 
in his wallet, and he had tied on 
his back a bundle of the long 
woody staves for torches. 

He entered the passage and 
gingerly began to work his way 
up it in the flickering torchlight. 
For the first twenty ells or so it 
was not bad. Then the passage 
narrowed so sharply that he had 
to crawl, pushing the torch ahead 
of him and dragging his burdens 
behind. The passage turned and 
192 



twisted like a serpent, this way 
and that, now left, now right. 
With each upward turn Thorinn’s 
spirits rose; but at last the pas- 
sage took a definite downward 
slope. 

He had used seven torches, and 
the last was half -burned when the 
passage abruptly widened again. 
Thorinn crawled out into a black 
echoing space — another cavern, 
much smaller than the last. The 
opposite wall gleamed in the 
torchlight, streaked and knobbed 
with some glassy substance that 
seemed to have melted like tal- 
low and hardened again on the 
stone. But when he touched it, 
it was the stone itself. What fire 
could have melted the living rock 
like a candle? 

A trickle of water came from 
somewhere above and dripped 
from the bottommost knob with 
a melancholy sound. Thorinn 
cupped his palm under it and 
drank a sip, but it was bitter. 

He held his torch up, marvel- 
ing. At the far end of the cavern 
he found two level passageways, 
one opposite the other, as if they 
were parts of a single tunnel that 
happened to intersect the cavern. 
Thorinn took the left-hand 
branch. His last torch burned his 
fingers, and he dropped it. He 
kept going, using the light-box. 
Almost at once the passage wid- 
ened, the ceiling rose and became 
a dome three ells high. In the 

GALAXY 



middle of the passageway lay 
something enormous, circular and 
dark. 

Hphorinn stared at it suspicious- 
ly. It made no move; neither 
did it have any eyes or limbs, so 
far as he could see. He ventured 
to touch it. It had the chill hard- 
ness of iron; it was wrought met- 
al, the largest piece he had ever 
seen — like a giant’s shield, ten 
spans across, having a circular 
hole pierced in it of three spans’ 
width. This hole was not in the 
center of the shield but to one 
side; through it he could see the 
brown, scuffed floor of the pas- 
sage. 

He knelt and laid his palm cur- 
iously on the metal near the rim 
of the hole. And the massive 
shield turned under his hand as 
if it were afloat. 

Thorinn sprang back, hand to 
his sword. But the shield was 
slowly rotating upon some hidden 
pivot, returning to its former 
place. When the hole was where 
it had been before, it stopped. 

A second time Thorinn bent 
forward, put his hand on the 
shield and felt it turn. When he 
took his hand away, it swung 
slowly back to rest. 

Thorinn settled back on his 
haunches and stared at the shield. 
He liked it very little. What 
could it be doing here, a thing 
apparently shaped by man, yet 
THE WORLD AND THORINN 



so cunningly pivoted that it 
seemed to have no weight? Surely 
it must be some springe or man- 
trap set by demons. 

As he hesitated, a sound came 
to his ears — the faintest of whis- 
pering or rustling noises; it seem- 
ed to come from beneath the 
shield. Cautiously he bent nearer. 

The sound died away, then re- 
turned. It was a sound like that 
of some small creature crawling, 
scraping along in the space under 
the shield ... no, not like that, 
but like some sound that he knew. 
It was a sound that made him 
think of Hovenskar .... Then 
he had it: wind in the grasses. 

The thing was impossible. Yet 
the more he listened, the more 
sure he grew. Using the tip of his 
scabbard, he prodded the shield. 
Under the circular hole, brown 
rock moved past, then a sudden 
glint of brightness. The wind 
sound grew louder: a warm 

breath of air arose. The bright 
lozenge expanded to a cramped 
circle, then filled up the hole. 

Thorinn’s breath had stopped. 
He was looking down into depths 
of silver light and brown-green 
shadow. There were stripes of 
darker brown, diminishing in a 
curiously painful way. At last he 
realized that they were tree 
trunks, gnarled and huge, that 
dropped darkening through space 
until they were tiny as needles’ 
ends at the bottom. 



193 



It was the Midworld down 
there; somehow in his wanderings 
down through the cavern, he had 
got above it, for there it lay be- 
low him. 

His luck was incredible! More- 
over, this must be the Highlands. 
Deep as it was, the gulf below 
him was nothing like so deep as 
the sky above Hovenskar. 

His mind was busy with the 
problem of reaching one of those 



giant trees and clambering down. 
It would be difficult and danger- 
ous, but in this moment of happi- 
ness he had no doubt that he 
would succeed. There it all was 
below him, the land he had 
dreamed of. In a few moments he 
would be standing there, breath- 
ing free; apd the life he had 
counted lost once more would 
begin.

FORECAST 



The next issue of Galaxy marks one of the happier occasions of our 
career. 

To begin with, we've got some good stories for you. Harlan Ellison is 
with us, with a piece called The Beast That Shouted "Love"! Damon 
Knight has another "Thorinn" novelette, taking up the tale of his far-future 
adventurer as he emerges from the caverns and finds himself in The Garden 
of Ease — lovely world, where no one ever needs work, and those who do 
find themselves not only outcasts but definitely injurious to all around them. 
And, of course, we'll have the conclusion of Cliff Simak's Goblin Reservation, 
about which we have few reservations. (It's his first long one in Galaxy 
since Here Gather the Stars. That one won him a Hugo, and we wouldn't 
be surprised to find this one in competition for the next set of Hugos.) 
The rest of the issue isn't quite as definite yet — depends on how the type 
sets — but it looks like we'll have a John Brunner, a Brian W. Aldiss, very 
likely another Ross Rocklynne, and of course the usual first-rate contribu- 
tions by Willy Ley and Algis Budrys. 

But what makes the June issue of Galaxy special in our book isn't the 
stories, but the fact that will be the last bi-monthly issue — or the first 
monthly issue — well, figure it how you wills with the next issue Galaxy 
goes monthly again. Same price. Same size. Same quality. Same all-star 
lineup of authors. The only difference is that from now we'll be doing it 
twelve times a year instead of six. And enjoying every minute of it.

Forgotten road to success in writing 



By J. D. Ratcliff 

I can’t imagine why more beginners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I’ve made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I've enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on assignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you — but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, 1 joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at home, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising or Business Writing.) 

You learn to write by writing. Our in- 
structors, themselves ail published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print in 
more than 100 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 



Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well — or offer other 
evidence of writing ability — you may enroll. 
However, there is no obligation to do so.- 




“Jack" Ratcliff is one of America’s highest paid 
free-lance writers. Although he works only 
four hours a day, he has had hundreds of articles 
published in top magazines, including over 
100 in Reader's Digest alone.
