What Strange Powers 

Did The Ancients Possess? 










PVERY important discovery relating 
^ to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to self' 
advancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and sue* 
cessful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature’s laws, accumulat' 
ed through the ages, is never lost: At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Thdr Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than 1/lOOth of 1% of the earth’s 
people were thought capable of receiv- 
ing basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general pubh'c; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which “whispers” to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weak' 
nesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example; The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and deep* 
ing. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in ufe. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of self* 
understanding and self'advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world’s 
oldest institutions, first known in Amer* 
ica in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosi' 
crucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the “Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis,” abbreviated by the ini- 
tials “AMORC.” The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a com- 
mercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, “The Mastery of Life.” 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
diat you write for your copy to: Scribe

T IKE any good story, science 
^ fiction or otherwise, the serial 
beginning in this issue. Gladiator 
at Law, operates on many levels 
besides plot: 

• It has a logically and exciting- 
ly constructed society. 

• Its characters are the inevitable 
products of that society. 

• The society itself is equally in- 
evitable if certain factors come 
about. As I’ve said before, we’re 
not concerned with whether they 
will, only with whether they may. 

In this serial, we have an ex- 
ploration of a theme that, as far 
as I know, has never been treated 
in science fiction — the effects of a 
dramatic advance in architecture. 

Our dwellings haven’t been the 
products of accident since we left 
the caves. Even those were chosen 
because of environment, being 
warmer, drier and easier to de- 
fend than anything primitive 
Man was able to construct. 

Warmth, shelter and defense — 
those have always been the pri- 
mary needs in housing. Some- 
times one or another becomes less 
important and others take their 
place — the mobility of nomad 
tents, the social prestige of orna- 
mentation in mansions and pal- 
aces, the spiritual awe of temples 
and cathedrals. But each of these 



tells us explicitly what the times 
and those who did the building 
were like, for architecture is as 
eloquent a form of communica- 
tion as literature, music or paint- 
ing. 

In many societies, defense was 
the first consideration. Tree- 
houses may not be very comfor- 
table, and they certainly attract 
insects, but they’re fine for stay- 
ing out of reach of predatory 
animals. Huts on stilts, far out in 
lakes, were dark and chilly — 
skulls of their owners indicate a 
high incidence of severe sinusitis 
— but they did keep off hostile 
tribes. 

Probably the most extreme sac- 
rifices to defense were Indian 
pueblos and medieval castles. 
Wherever possible, pueblo com- 
munities were built on sheer cliffs, 
which were scaled by ladders 
pulled up after the climbers — and 
so were the huts themselves, 
which had to be entered from the 
roof. Living in a castle is a con- 
tradiction in terms; every com- 
fort was subordinated to defense, 
from the stench of the moat to the 
thick-walled deep freeze to the 
musty ventilation of windows 
that were actually slitted battle 
stations. 

How far we’ve come from the

menaces of the past is told hilari- 
ously and outrageously by T. H. 
Robsjohn-Gibbings in Homes of 
the Brave (Knopf; $3.50) and 
illustrated even more outrage- 
ously by Mary Petty’s ruthlessly 
funny drawings. 

The chapter headings give a 
notion of the book’s tone: Ab- 
original “Modem,” Low-Life 
“Modern,” Movie “Modern,” In- 
terplanetary “Modern.” There is 
another heading, directly related 
to Gladiator at Law, that I’ll 
come right back to. 

Warmth, shelter, defense and 
all other past motives for hous- 
ing are mere adjuncts in Homes 
of the Brave to something entirely 
new — expression of the personal- 
ity. How personality is expressed 
— and whose, architect, contrac- 
tor, interior decorator or owner — 
is its ticklesome and yet down- 
right grave theme. What it re- 
duces to is that the personality 
expressed is laughable, pathetic 
or infuriating to the beholder. 

Robsjohn - Gibbings’ explana- 
tion is that “great architecture 
comes only with individual great- 
ness,” and the man he has in 
mind is the indisputably great 
Frank Lloyd Wright. As Voltaire 
said about something else en- 
tirely, it’s a noble theory,' con- 
tradicted only by the facts. 

No architect, however great, 
can make his ideas survive in the 
wrong historic or geographic en- 



vironment — not even Wright. 

For example, did you know 
you can buy a European castle 
for $3,000? There are no takers, 
of course — castles serve no pur- 
pose now. Thus dangerous ages 
produce fortress homes and it’s 
unreasonable to expect simplicity 
in a garish age, or lavishness in an 
austere one. 

The chapter Dome, Sweet 
Dome is the one related to 
Gladiator at Law. You’ll find 
bubble houses in the serial — 
though not the kind Mr. R-G re- 
jects as fit for termites, Eskimos 
and Victorian wax flowers. Re- 
member what Charles Fort said? 
Steam engines come along when 
it’s steam-engine time! That’s 
also true of architecture. 

Examine the homes of any 
given era and you’ll know the 
society they were an expression 
of and the personalities and prin- 
cipal needs of the people who 
built and lived in them. 

There are two ruinous features 
in ours — building techniques are 
still handicraft; our buildings be- 
gin to deteriorate the moment 
they are completed. Imagine what 
overcoming those handicaps 
would mean! 

That is just what Pohl and 
Kornbluth did. How does archi- 
tecture influence a story? Well, 
picture Morte D' Artur set in a 
housing development. You see?

T he accused was a tallow- 
faced weasel with Consti- 
tutional Psychopathic 
Inferior stamped all over him. He 
wailed to Charles Mundin, Ll.B., 
“You got to get me off! I’ve been 
up twice and this time they’ll 
condition me !’’ 

Mundin studied his first client 
with distaste. “You won’t plead 
guilty?” he asked again, hope- 
lessly. He had been appointed by 
the court and considered that the 
court had played him a low trick.

His stubborn client’s pore pat- 
terns were all over Exhibit A, a 
tin cashbox fishhooked from a 
ticket window at Monmouth Sta- 
dium. Modus operand! coincided 
with his two previous convictions. 
An alleged accomplice, who had 
kept the ticket clerk busy for al- 
most all of the necessary five 
minutes, was ready to take the 
witness stand — having made his 
deal with the prosecutor. And still 
the fool was refusing to cop a 
plea. 

Mundin tried again. “It won’t 
be so bad, you know. Just a 
couple of days in a hospital. It’s 
quite painless, and that’s not just 
talk. I’ve seen it with my own 
eyes. They took us around in 
Junior year — ’’ 

“Counselor, you just don’t un- 
derstand. If they condition me, 
.my God, I’ll actually have to go 
to work!” 

Mundin shrugged. “I’ll do what 
I can for you.” 

¥>UT the trial was over in a 
matter of minutes. Mundin 
objected that the moral character 
of the witness made his testimony 
inadmissible in a conditionable 
offense. The prosecutor, a gran- 
dee from Harvard Law, haught- 
ily smacked him down by 
pointing out that the essence of 
the conditionable offense lay in 
the motivation of the accused, not 
in the fact of commission which 



was all the accomplice had testi- 
fied to. He then cited a series of 
precedents. 

The judge’s eyes went blank 
and distant. Those inside the rail 
could hear confirmation of the 
precedents droning faintly into 
his ears through the headphones 
under his elaborate wig. He nod- 
ded and said to Mundin, “Over- 
ruled. Get on with it.” 

Mundin didn’t even bother to 
take an exception. 

The prosecution rested and 
Mundin got up, his throat dry. 
“May it please the Court,” he 
said. His Honor looked as though 
nothing bad pleased that court, 
ever. Mundin said to the jury 
box, “The defense, contending 
that no case has been made, will 
present no witnesses.” That, at 
any rate, would keep Harvard 
Law from letting tite jury know 
of the two previous convictions. 
“The defense rests.” 

Harvard Law, smiling coldly, 
delivered a thirty-second summa- 
tion which, in three razor-sharp 
syllogisms, demonstrated the fact 
that defendant was guilty as hell. 

The court clerk’s fingers clicked 
briskly on the tape-cutter, then 
poised expectantly as Mundin 
stood up. 

“May it please the Court,” said 
Mundin. That look again. “My 
client has not been a fortunate 
man. The product of a broken 
home and the gutters of Belly

Rave, he deserves justice as does 
every citizen. But in his case, I 
am impelled to add that the ends 
of justice can be served only by 
an admixture of mercy.” 

Judge and prosecutor were 
smiling openly. The devil with 
dignity! Mundin craned his neck 
to read the crisp yellow tape that 
came clicking out of the clerk’s 
encoding machine. He could read 
jury box code, more or less, if it 
were simple enough. 

The encoded transcript of his 
summation was simple enough. 
The tape read — 

o=:o . 0=0 . 0=0 . 

“Defense rests,” he mumbled, 
ignoring a despairing croak from 
his client. 

^HE judge said, “Mr. Clerk, 
-*■ present the case to the jury 
box.” 

The clerk briskly fed in the 
two tapes. The jury box hummed 
and twinkled. If you could only 
fix one of those things, Mundin 
thought savagely, staring at the 
big seal on it. Or if you could 
get one of those damned clerks 
to cut the tape — no, that was out, 
too. The clerks were voluntarily 
conditioned. Traded freedom for 
a sure living. 

The red window lit up. guilty 
AS CHARGED. 

“Work!” the thief bleated. 

The judge said, shifting his wig 
and showing a bit of earphone 



under it, “Mr. Bailiff, take charge 
of the prisoner. Sentencing to- 
morrow at eleven. Court’s ad- 
journed.” 

The thief moaned, “I hate them 
damn machines. Couldn’t you 
have got me a human jury, may- 
be get an injunction?” 

Mundin said wearily, “A hu- 
man jury would have crucified 
you. Why did you have to steal 
from the Stadium? Why not pick 
on something safe, like the 
Church, or the judge’s piggy 
bank?” He turned his back on 
the defendant and bumped into 
Harvard Law. 

“Nice try, young man,” the 
grandee smiled frostily. “Can’t 
win them all, can we?” 

Mundin replied rudely, “If 
you’re so smart, why aren’t you 
a corporation lawyer?” and 
stamped out of the courtroom. 

He was on the street before 
he regretted the crack. Harvard’s 
face had fallen satisfactorily, but 
the jibe was o=o if ever there was 
one. Why, indeed? For the same 
reason Mundin himself wasn’t, 
of course. He hadn’t inherited one 
of the great hereditary corpora- 
tion law practices. Even grinding 
through Harvard Law School 
couldn’t get you conveniently re- 
born into the proper families. And 
Mundin hadn’t gone to Harvard. 
Not for Harvard — or for Charles 
Mundin — the great reorganiza- 
tions, receiverships and debenture

issues. Not for them the mergers 
and protective committees. For 
them — the mechanical jury box 
and the trivia of criminal law. 

A morose, fifteen-minute walk 
through Monmouth’s sweltering, 
rutted streets brought him to his 
office building. Some cluck from 
the sheriff’s office was going to 
pick him up at 1400 for the rally. 
Besides being a member of the 
Criminal Bar, Charles Mundin, 
Ll.B., was foredoomed candidate 
for the Monmouth City Council 
on the Regular Republican ticket 
in the 27th Aldermanic District. 

His wallet-nerve twinged at the 
thought, then twinged again as 
his eye fell on the quietly proud 
little plaque beside the door of 
the building. It announced that 
its rental agents were sorry, but 
could offer no vacancies. Mundin 
hoped rentals would stay that 
way, at least as far as his own 
office was concerned. 

H e got an elevator to himself. 

“Sixteen,” he told it. He was 
thinking of his first client. At 
least he would get a fee — you got 
one on conditionable cases. The 
crook was terrified that he’d find 
himself unable to steal. Maybe 
Counselor Mundin himself might 
soon be driven to dangling a 
hook and line over the wall of a 
ticket window at Monmouth Sta- 
dium. 

Or he might get really desper- 



ate and find himself one of the 
contestants in the Field Day in- 
side. 

His mail hopper was empty, 
but his Sleepless Secretary — he 
was still paying for it — was blink- 
ing for his attention. The rental 
agents again? Lawbook salesman? 
Maybe even a client? “Go ahead,” 
he said. 

In its accurate voice, the ma- 
chine reported, “Telephone call. 
1205 hours. Mr. Mundin is out, 
madam. If you wish to leave a 
message, I will take it down.” 
Del Dworcas’ outraged bari- 
tone shouted, “Who the hell are 
you calling madam?” 

The secretary : “Gug-gug-^u^ 
— ow-wooh. Sir.” 

Dworcas: “What? Oh, one of 
those damn gadgets. Well, listen, 
Charlie, if you ever get this. I 
sent somebody over to see you. 
Named Bligh. Treat him right. 
And look me up at the rally. 
Something to talk about with 
you. And you better get that 
lousy machine fixed unless you 
want to lose some business.” 
The secretary, after a pause: 
“Is that the end of your message, 
madam?” 

Dworcas: “Yes! And stop call- 
ing me madam!” 

The secretary : “Gug-gug-^u^ 
— ow-wooh.” And click. 

Oh, fine, thought Mundin. Now 
Dworcas was sore at him, no 
doubt, and Dworcas was chair-

man of the Regular Republican 
County Committee. And the sec- 
retary’s confusion between the 
sexes and its banshee howl weren’t 
covered by the service contract. 

The mailtube popped while he 
was blaspheming the salesman 
who had flattered him into buy- 
ing the secretary. He eagerly 
flushed the letter from its hopper, 
but when he caught sight of the 
return address, he dropped it un- 
opened. It was from the Scholar- 
ship Realization Corporation. He 
knew he owed them the money 
and he knew, as a result of the 
law course they had paid for, 
that they couldn’t attach his hy- 
pothetical income. 

^^HERE was nothing to do until 
someone showed up — this 
Bligh or the man from the sher- 
iff’s office. Trying hard to think 
of the priceless publicity and con- 
tacts he was getting from his 
flier in politics, he took his ac- 
count book out and added it up. 
It made him wince. The price 
of the priceless publicity and 
contacts to date was $854.32. 

Of course, he reminded himself, 
the Party had laid out money, 
too. That TV time, for instance, 
when he was right there on the 
platform, must have cost a hunk 
of change. Of course, he hadn’t 
actually spoken. 

But his end included postage, 
stationery, truck rental, PA sys- 

GLADiATOR AT LAW 



tern rental, direct-mail fees, car- 
fare, banquet tickets, fight tickets, 
Field Day tickets, fund-raising 
lottery tickets, charities, dues and 
entertainment. Then the rivers of 
beer, which he didn’t enjoy, 
drunk with people he didn’t like. 
And the bhang, which scared hell 
out of him, sipped with the tee- 
total Muslims of the 27th Dis- 
trict. There was the way his 
doctor had tsk-tsked when he 
last stood in front of a fluoroscop>e 
with a barium meal coursing slug- 
gishly through him. 

And, of course, the certainty 
that he would be crushed like a 
bug on election day. And that 
The Boys — ^Dworcas was only one 
of The Boys — ^had played him for 
a sucker. 

Sing “Hey" for the life of a 
lawyer, gabbling at machines 
that, he naggingly suspected, 
thought him not as bright as they 
were. 

The Sleepless Secretary said, 
“Sir or madam, as the case may 
be. Gug-gug-^u^. Regret to ad- 
vise.” Mundin kicked it savagely. 
It burped and said : “A gentleman 
is in the outer office, Mrs. Mun- 
din.” 

“Come in!” Mundin yelled at 
the door. 

The man blinked at him and 
came in cautiously. He looked 
around and picked out a chair. 
He wore a hearing aid, Mundin 
noticed. Perhaps that was why 

11 



he cocked his head a little. 

He said, “My name’s Norvell 
Bligh. I — uh — asked Mr. Dwor- 
cas if he could recommend a first- 
class attorney and he — uh — he 
suggested you.” 

Mundin asked aloofly, “What 
can I do for you?” 

"OLIGH’S eyes roamed nervous- 
ly around the room. “My 
wife — that is, I would like to get 
some information on adoption. I 
have a stepdaughter — my wife’s 
daughter by her first marriage, 
you see — and, well, my wife 
thinks we should arrange about 
adopting her.” 

Good old Del Dworcas, Mun- 
din thought savagely. He knows I 
belong to the Criminal Bar, yet 
he goes right ahead . He said, 
“I’m sorry, Mr. Bligh. I can’t 
help you. You’ll have to find a 
civil attorney to handle that for 
you.” 

Bligh touched the control of 
his hearing aid. 

“Beg pardon?” 

"I— can't— do— it!" 

“Oh, I know you can’t,” 
Bligh said. “Mr. Dworcas ex- 
plained that. But he said that 
the civil attorneys would charge 
an awful lot, while you . That 
is, since you’re a friend of his 
and I’m a friend of his brother, 
it could be done on a friendly ba- 
sis. All I need to know, really, is 
what to do. I don’t think I’d 



have to have a lawyer in court, 
do you?” 

Mundin pondered hopefully. 
“Maybe not.” It was questionable 
practice, no doubt of it, and small 
thanks to Dworcas for getting 
him into it. Still, if it was just a 
matter of advice and information 
— thank God, the corporation 
boys didn’t have that sewed up. 

He leaned back, covertly look- 
ing Bligh over. Tolerably well 
dressed, certainly not a deadbeat. 
He’d be some kind of contract 
worker, no doubt, getting his reg- 
ular pay, living in a G-M-L 
house, suffering his wife’s obvious 
nagging. 

Mundin said, “Tell me the 
story. First of all, the court will 
want to be sure you can earn 
enough to support the child.” 

“Well, I’ve been supporting her 
for three years. Excuse me, Mr. 
Mundin, but can we keep this 
short? I’m on my lunch hour and 
Mr. Candella is very fussy about 
promptness.” 

“Certainly. Just give me the 
facts.” 

N orvell bligh coughed 

self-consciously. “I’m an as- 
sociate producer for General 
Recreations, in charge of Field 
Day procurement, mostly. My 
wife is named Virginia. She was 
married before I met her to a 
man named Tony Elliston. They 
didn’t get along too well — it was 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a pretty rough experience for her. 
They had one daughter, Alex- 
andra. Virginia’s first husband 
died. I have the pajjers here. Al- 
exandra is 14 now. An}rthing 
else?” 

Mundin scribbled rapidly — 
purely pretense, since the Sleep- 
less Secretary was recording the 
whole thing automatically. On 
second thought, he told himself, 
maybe not pretense at that, con- 
sidering the way it was acting. 
He put down his pencil. 

“That’s enough for the time 
being,” he said. “I’ll have to look 
up — have to discuss this matter 
with one of my colleagues. Come 
back Friday at this time.” 

As Bligh left, looking vaguely 
alarmed, the Sleepless Secretary 
said, “Pending the receipt. Ow- 
woooh. Mrs. Mundin is out of 
of town.” 

Mundin turned it off. 

Two clients in one day, he 
thought wonderingly. Anything 
was possible. Perhaps he would 
even win the election. Perhaps 
he wouldn’t, after all, have to 
let the finance company reclaim 
the secretary and the Scholarship 
people garnishee his income and 
the landlord toss him out on the 
street. 

Perhaps. 

RENTED sound truck, 
with the man from the sher- 
iff’s office driving, rolled slowly 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



past glowering red brick fronts 
and stone stoops crowded with 
liquid-eyed women and their 
skinny, brownish kids. Mvmdin 
didn’t like this neighborhood. It 
was on the outskirts of the city, 
too close to Belly Rave for safety, 
too close to the factories and the 
yards for comfort. But he didn’t 
have to live here, even if the 
miracle should happen and he got 
elected. 

He chanted wearily into the 
mike at the indifferent Ay-rabs 
of the 27th, “My friends, don’t 
miss the big free rally tonight 
at Republican Hall. Learn the 
truth, don’t be misled. The Regu- 
lar Republican Party promises 
inside plumbing for every family. 
We promise stockyard workers 
paid time off for noon prayers 
and doubling the bonus for hand- 
ling pork. My friends, don’t miss 
the big free rally. Don’t fail to 
miss the big free — ” 

“Hey!” the driver cried. 

Mundin put his hand over the 
mike. “Damn! Right out of my 
subconscious, that one.” He un- 
covered the mike and said, “Don’t 
miss the big free rally. The Regu- 
lar Republicans are the party of 
Lincoln, the party of Eisenhower. 
We stand for inside plumbing. 
Learn the truth at the big free 
rally . .” 

The liquid eyes stared entirely 
without interest. Mundin subsid- 
ed and turned on the sound tape. 

13 



The speaker horns began to blare 
You and Me and the Moon. 
Apathetically, he noted that one 
of the older Ay-rab women wore 
a veil. Unusual, nowadays. 

The driver leaned over and 
nudged him. “You’ll never get 
anjrwhere with the Ay-rabs, Mr. 
Mundin,” he said confidentially. 
“We had a good crowd in the 
27th before the war. Poles and 
Irish. The Poles voted Republi- 
can — you only had one Republi- 
can party then, you know. And 
the Irish voted Democrat. But 
then the packers began flying in 
the Ay-rabs and now you don’t 
know where you stand.” 

Mundin nodded indifferently. 

They passed somebody’s G-M- 
L bubble house, obviously an 
early model, before the corpora- 
tion figured out the bubble-city 
plan, and it was showing its age. 
Mundin could see the family tak- 
ing their ease in the living room. 
He chuckled. Their polarizer was 
out of order and they didn’t know 
it. 

But the driver was shocked. 
He stopped the truck and honked, 
pointing indignantly through the 
wall. The man heard the honking 
and hastily strode to a manual 
control. The wall opaqued. 

The truck rolled on. The driver 
muttered something about god- 
dam fishbowls. “Fm a married 
man,” he added indignantly and 
irrelevantly. 



“Yeah,” said Mundin. “Say, 
the hell with 85th Street. Turn 
around — let’s go back to the 
club.” 

He flicked off the speakers in 
mid-chorus. It made no differ- 
ence to the dark, liquid eyes : they 
followed the silent truck as un- 
caringly as they had the blaring 
horns. 

“My friends,” Mundin said to 
the dead microphone, “vote for 
my opponent. He’s as big a liar 
as I am, but he can afford this 
and I can’t.” 

Which was also irrelevant, for 
he was stuck with it now. 

II 

^^HIS fellow Mundin might not 
not be much of a lawyer, Nor- 
vie Bligh told himself on the way 
back to his office, but at least he 
probably wouldn’t charge much. 
Amie Dworcas had as much as 
promised him that. 

Anyway, who needed a legal 
eagle to put adoption papers 
through? The whole thing was 
downright silly. If only Ginny 
weren’t so touchy lately, you 
could explain to her that it was 
just an unwarranted expense, that 
nobody was going to take Alex- 
andra away from them, that there 
wasn’t any question about who’d 
inherit his contract status and 
bubble house if he died. 

He considered that for a mo- 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ment. Virginia had certainly 
seemed to take that part of it 
seriously, he thought. She had 
mentioned it half a dozen times. 
“Don’t forget to ask him about 
inheriting.” And, of course, he 
had forgotten. Well, there wbuld 
be another chance on Friday. 

You couldn’t really blame Vir- 
ginia if she felt a little — well, 
insecure. Life with that Tony 
must have been pure hell, living 
in Belly Rave from hand to 
mouth. That was why she was 
such a devoted wife. 

Of course she was a devoted 
wife, he told himself. 

Right now, though, the import- 
ant thing was whether Candella 
was going to say anything about 
his being fifteen minutes late. 
Candella was pretty difficult late- 
ly. Naturally, you couldn’t blame 
him for being jumpy, with the 
big Fall Field Day coming up 
and all. 

Of course you couldn’t blame 
Candella. Of course you couldn’t 
blame Virginia, or Arnie Dworcas 
when his promises didn’t jell, or 
Alexandra when she was a little 
touchy, like any 14-year-old, of 
course. 

Of course you couldn’t blame 
anybody for anything. Not if you 
were Norvell Bligh. 

Fortunately, Candella didn’t 
notice what time he came back 
from lunch. But in the middle of 
the afternoon, the boss’s secre- 



tary came hurrying out to Nor- 
vie’s desk and said, “Mr. Candella 
would like to discuss your Field 
Day program with you.” 

He went in with a feeling of un- 
easiness. 

Old man Candella slapped the 
papers down and roared. “Bligh, 
maybe you think a Field Day is 
a Boy Scout rally, where kids 
shoot arrows and run footraces 
around a tennis court. Maybe 
you think it’s a Ladies’ Aid pink 
tea. Maybe you just don’t know 
what a Field Day is supposed to 
be. Is that it?” 

N ORVIE bligh swallowed. 
“No, sir,” he whispered. 

“ ‘No, sir,’ ” Candella mimick- 
ed. “Well, if you do know what 
a Field Day is, why isn’t there 
at least one good, exciting idea 
in this whole bloody script? I 
take back that word ‘bloody.’ 
There might be some complaints 
in the other direction, but I guar- 
antee there wouldn’t be any com- 
plaints that there was too much 
blood.” 

He jabbed at the program with 
a hairy forefinger. “Listen to this. 
‘Opening pageant — procession of 
jeeps through gauntlet of spear- 
men. First spectacle — fifty girl 
wrestlers versus fifty male boxers. 
First duet — sixty-year-old men 
with blowtorches.’ Ah, what’s the 
use of going on? This is supposed 
to be the big event of the year. 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



15 



Bligh. It isn’t a Friday-night 
show in the off season. This is 
the one that counts. It’s got to 
be special." 

Nprvie Bligh shifted miserably. 
“Gosh, Mr. Candella, I — I 
thought it was. It’s a classical 
motif, don’t you see? It’s like — ’’ 

“I can tell what it’s like,” Can- 
della bellowed. “I’ve been pro- 
ducing these shows for fifteen 
years. I don’t need anybody to 
tell me whether a script will play 
or it won’t — and I’m telling you 
this one won’t!” 

He stabbed a button on his 
console. 

Norvie felt the seat lurch wam- 
ingly underneath him and barely 
managed to scramble to his feet 
as it disappeared into the wall. 

“Take this script away,” Can- 
della growled. “We’ve got to start 
casting on Monday. Let’s see if 
we can have something by tomor- 
row night.” He didn’t even look 
up as Norvie cringed out the door. 

Norvie dictated and erased five 
tapes. He sent his three assistants 
on three different errands of re- 
search, to find the best spectacles 
on the highest-rated Field Days 
in every major city. Nothing they 
brought back was any help. 

When Miss Dali came in to 
pick up the afternoon’s dictation 
and he had to face the fact that 
there was no afternoon’s dicta- 
tion, he grumbled to her, “What 
do they expect in that moldy gym 



they call a stadium here? Look at 
Pittsburgh — ^we’re twice as big 
and they have armored half- 
tracks.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Miss Dali. “Mr. 
Stimmens would like to see you.” 
“All right,” he replied ungra- 
ciously and dialed a chair for his 
junior scriptwriter. 

“Excuse me. Chief,” Stimmens 
said hesitantly. “Can I see you 
for a moment?” 

“You’re seeing me.” Norvie had 
picked that bon mot up from 
Candella the week before. 

S timmens hesitated, then 
blurted much too rapidly, 
“You’ve got a great organization 
here. Chief, and I’m proud to be 
a part of it. But I’m having a 
little trouble — you know, trying 
to get ahead, hah-hah — and I 
wonder if it wouldn’t be better for 
you. Chief, as well as me if . .” 
He went on through a tortuous 
story of a classification clerk’s 
mistakes when he had finished 
school, and an opening in Con- 
sumer Relations, and a girl who 
wouldn’t marry him until he got 
a Grade Fifteen rating. 

Long before Stimmens had 
come anywhere near the point, 
Norvie knew what he wanted and 
knew what the answer had to be. 
But Candella’s bruises were fresh 
on his back and he let Stimmens 
go on till he was dry. Then, 
briskly, “Stimmens, ii I’m not in 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



error, you signed the regular con- 
tract before you joined us.” 
“Well, yes, sir, but — ” 

“It has the usual provision for 
cancellation. I believe you know 
the company’s policy in regard to 
selling contracts. We simply can- 
not afford to sell unless the pur- 
chase price is high enough to re- 
imburse us for the employee’s 
training time — ^which, in your 
case, is all the time you’ve spent 
with us, since you have clearly 
failed to master your job. I’m 
surprised you should come to me 
with such a request.” 

Stimmens stared at him. “You 
won’t let me go?” 

“I can’t. You’re at liberty to 
cancel your contract.” 

“Cancel! And go back to Belly 
Rave? Mr. Bligh, have you ever 
been in Belly Rave?” He shook 
his head like a man dispelling a 
nightmare. “Well, sorry, Mr. 
Bligh. Anything else for me to do 
today?” 

Norvie looked at his watch. 
“Tomorrow,” he growled. As 
Stimmens slumped away, Norvie, 
already feeling ashamed of him- 
self, petulantly swept the chair 
back into the wall. 

It was almost quitting time. 

He made a phone call. “Mr. 
Arnold Dworcas, please . 
Arnie? Hello, how’re you? Fine. 
Say, I saw that attorney, Mun- 
din, today. Looks like everything 
will be all right . Uh-huh. 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



Thanks a lot, Arnie . This 
evening? Sure. I was hoping 
you’d ask me. All right if I go 
home first? Ginny’ll want to hear 
about the lawyer . About eight, 
then.” 

A rnie Dworcas had a way of 
chewing a topic interminably 
and regurgitating it in flavorless 
pellets of words. Lately he had 
been preoccupied with what he 
called the ingratitude of the bene- 
ficiaries of science. 

At their frequent get-togethers, 
he would snarl at Norvie, “Not 
that it matters to Us Engineers. 
Don’t think I take it personally, 
just because I happen to be es- 
sential to the happiness and com- 
fort of everybody in the city. No, 
Norvie, We Engineers don’t ex- 
pect a word of thanks. We En- 
gineers work because there’s a 
job to do, and we’re trained for 
it. But that doesn’t alter the fact 
that people are lousy ingrates.” 
At which point, Norvie would 
cock his head a little in the 
nervous reflex he had acquired 
with the hearing aid and agree, 
“Of course, Arnie. Hell, fifty years 
ago, when the first bubble cities 
went up, women used to burst out 
crying when they got a look at 
one. My mother did. Coming out 
of Belly Rave, knowing she’d 
never have to go back — ” 

“Yeah. Not that that’s evi- 
dence, as We Engineers under- 

17 



stand evidence. It’s just your un- 
trained recollection of what an 
untrained woman told you. But it 
gives you an idea of how those 
lousy ingrates settled down and 
got smug. They’d change their 
tune damn fast if We Engineers 
weren’t on the job. But you’re 
an artist, Norvell. You can’t be 
expected to understand.” And he 
would gloomily drink beer. 

Going home from work and 
looking forward to seeing his best 
friend later that night, Norvie 
was not so sure he didn’t under- 
stand. He even felt inclined to 
argue that he wasn’t an artist 
like some crackpot oil painter or 
novelist in a filthy Belly Rave 
hovel, but a technician in his 
own right. Well, kind of — his 
medium was the emotional fluxes 
of a Field Day crowd, rather 
than torques, forces and electrons. 

He had an important job, Nor- 
vie told himself — Associate Pro- 
ducer, Monmouth Stadium Field 
Days. Of course, Arnie far out- 
stripped him in title. Arnie was 
Engineer Supervising Rotary and 
Reciprocal Pump Installations 
and Maintenance for Monmouth 
G-M-L City. 

Not that Arnie was the kind of 
guy to stand on rank. Hell, look 
at how Arnie was always doing 
things for you — like finding you a 
lawyer when you needed one, and 
. Well, he was always doing 
things for you. 



It was a privilege to know a 
man like Arnie Dworcas. 

Ill 

C HARLES Mundin, Ll.B., just 
parked the truck for the 
sheriff’s man — he was too busy 
— and entered Republican Hall 
through the back way. 

He found Del Dworcas in the 
balcony — the Hall was a slightly 
remodeled movie house — telling 
the cameramen how to place their 
cameras, the sound men how to 
line up their parabolic mikes, the 
electricians how to use their 
lights. 

Mundin stood on the sidelines, 
faintly hoping one of the camera- 
men would extract a few of 
Dworcas’ front teeth with a tri- 
pod leg, but they kept their 
tempers admirably. He sighed 
and tapped the chairman on the 
shoulder. 

Dworcas gave him the big hello 
and asked him to wait in the 
manager’s office — he had to get 
these TV people squared away, 
but it wouldn’t take more than a 
few minutes. “Did you see that 
fellow Bligh?” he asked. “Yeah? 
Good. Soak him, Charley; you 
got to make a living, you know. 
Some friend of my brother 
Arnie’s. Now go on down to the 
office. Couple of people there for 
you to talk to.” He looked an- 
noyingly mysterious. 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Mundin sighed again. At the 
foot of the stairs, he yelled in 
astonishment, “Great God Al- 
mighty! Prince Wilhelm the 
Fourth!” 

William Choate IV jerked 
around and looked confused, then 
stuck out a hand for Mundin to 
grasp. He was a pudgy little man 
of Mundin’s age, a classmate 
from John Marshall Law School, 
heir to a mighty corporate prac- 
tice, a tidy dresser, former friend, 
solid citizen and four-star jerk. 
“Why, hello, Charles,” he said 
uncertainly. “Good to see you.” 

“Likewise. What are you doing 
here?” 

Choate made a mighty effort 
and produced a shrug. “Oh,” he 
said, “you know.” 

“Meaning that even a corpora- 
tion lawyer has political dealings 
once in a while?” Mundin helped 
him out. 

“That’s it exactly!” Choate was 
pleased. It was just like old times. 
Mundin had always helped him 
out, all the way through John 
Marshall Law. 

Mundin looked at his former 
proteg^ with emotions that were 
only distantly related to envy. 
“It’s a pleasure to run into you, 
Willie,” he said. “They keeping 
you busy?” 

“Busy? Whew! You’ll never 
know, Charles.” That was a 
very unfortunate remark, Mundin 
thought. “You know the I. G. 



Farben reorganization?” 

“By reputation,” Mundin said 
acidly. “I’m in criminal practice 
right now. Incidentally, I had an 
interesting case today — ” 

“Yes.” Choate said. “Well, you 
might say I’ve won my spurs. 
The old man made me counsel 
for the Group E Debenture Hold- 
er’s Protective Committee. Old 
Haskell died in harness, you 
know. Think of it — forty years 
as counsel for the Protective 
Committee! And with a hearing 
before the Referee in Receiver- 
ship coming up. Well, I won my 
spurs, as you might say. I argued 
before the referee this morning, 
and I got a four-year stay!” 
“Well,” Charles Mundin said. 
“To use a figure of speech, you 
certainly won your spurs, didn’t 
you?” 

C HOATE beamed. “I thought 
you’d see it that way. I sim- 
ply pointed out to old Roseheaver 
that rushing through an immedi- 
ate execution of receivership 
would work a hardship on the 
committee and I asked for more 
time to prepare our suits for the 
trust offices. Old Roseheaver 
thought it over and decided it 
would be in the public interest 
to grant a stay. And, Charles, he 
congratulated me on my presen- 
tation! He said he had never 
heard the argument read better!” 
“Well done,” said Mundin. It 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



19 



was impossible to resent this im- 
becile. A faint spark of technical 
interest made him ask, “How did 
you prove hardship?” 

Choate waved airily. “Oh, that 
was easy. We have this smart 
little fellow in the office, some 
kind of distant cousin of mine, I 
guess. He handles all the briefs. 
A real specialist — not much at the 
Big Picture, you know, but he 
could prove old man Winthrop 
was starving in the gutter if you 
told him to. I’m joking, of 
course,” he added hastily. 

Poor Willie, thought Mundin. 
Too dumb for Harvard Law, too 
dumb for Columbia, though he 
was rich enough to buy and sell 
them both. That was how he 
wound up at John Marshall, 
which had carried him for eight 
years of conditions and repeats 
until memorizing had worn 
grooves in his brain that carried 
him through his exams. Mun- 
din compassionately had written 
most of his papers. 

And poor dumb Willie glowed : 
“You know what that little job 
is worth? The firm’s putting in 
for two hundred and twenty-five 
thousand dollars, Charles! And as 
counsel of record, I get half!” 

That did it. Poor Willie 
thought he was just letting good 
old Charles know that the pro- 
t^g^ at last was a success on his 
own. But his kindly idiocy broke 
Mundin. 



“Willie,” he begged hoarsely, 
“give me a job. You know I’ve 
got the brains. You know you 
never would have got through 
school if it hadn’t been for me, 
and I never asked for a nickel. 
There were plenty of sharks 
around who would have soaked 
you plenty and still not got you 
through. Please, Willie. I can be 
a smart little fellow in your office 
just as well as somebody’s cousin. 
Give me a chance. Law clerk. The 
bottom. Anything!” 

W ILLIE said dismally, “Gosh, 
Charles, I don’t think we 
can do that. The old man 
wouldn’t understand at all if I 
asked for somebody who wasn’t 
in the family. Be fair, Charles. 
What would you do in my place?” 
Mundin hopelessly knew what 
he would do. He would keep the 
lucrative practice of corporate 
law right in the grip of the family. 
He would sit on top of his prac- 
tice with a shotgun in his lap. 

“I understand, Willie,” he said 
heavily. 

Willie glowed. “I knew you 
would, Charles. After all, it’s 
^ot to be a family affair. Why, 
with any luck. I’ll hand the 
Group E Debenture Holders’ 
Protective Committee down to 
William Choate the Fifth!” 
“Thank you, Willie,” Mundin 
said gently. “Must you go now?” 
“Must I? Oh. I guess I must. 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It’s been good seeing you, 
Charles. Keep up the good work.” 

Mundin stared impotently at 
his pudgy back. Then he turned 
wearily and went on to Dworcas’ 
office. 

Dworcas had still not arrived. 
The manager’s office, behind the 
closed-up ticket booth, was tiny 
and crowded with bales of litera- 
ture in Arabic and English. Two 
people were waiting there — a 
young man and a young woman 
— obviously brother and sister. 
Big sister, kid brother; they were 
maybe twenty-eight and twenty- 
two. 

The girl got up from behind 
one of the battered desks. No lip- 
stick, cropped hair, green slacks, 
a loose plaid shirt. 

“I’m Norma Lavin,’’ she said. 
“Mr. Mundin?’’ 

“Yes.” Why was good old Del 
passing this screwball on to him? 

“This is my brother Don.” 

Don Lavin had something 
weird and something familiar 
about him. His eyes drew the 
attention. Mundin had often read 
of “shining eyes” and accepted it 
as one of those things you read 
that don’t mean anything. Now 
he was disconcerted to find him- 
self looking into a pair of eyes 
that actually did shine. 

“Please sit down,” he invited 
uneasily. 

The girl said, “Mr. Dworcas 
tells us you’re a lawyer, Mr. 



Mundin, as well as our next 
councilman from the 27th Dis- 
trict.” 

]%^UNDIN automatically hand- 
ed her one of his fancy 
cards. Don Lavin looked a little 
as if he had been conditioned. 
That was it! Like a court clerk 
or one of the participants in a 
Field Day— or, he guessed, never 
having seen one, a criminal after 
the compulsory third-rap treat- 
ment. 

“I’m a lawyer,” he said. “I 
wouldn’t swear to that part about 
being councilman.” 

“You’re the best we can do, 
Mundin. We got nowhere in 
Washington, nowhere in Chicago, 
nowhere in New York. We’ll try 
local courts here. Dworcas passed 
us on to you. We have to start 
somewhere." 

“Somewhere,” her brother very 
dreamily agreed. 

“Look, Miss Lavin — 

“Just Lavin.” 

“Okay, Lavin, or Spike, or 
whatever you want me to call 
you. If you’re through with the 
insults, will you tell me what 
you want?” 

Del Dworcas stuck his head in 
the door. “You people getting 
along okay? Fine!” He vanished 
again. 

The girl said, “We want to re- 
tain you for a stockholders’ com- 
mittee — G-M-L Homes.” 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



21 



G - M - L Homes, Mundin 
thought, irritated. Why, that 
meant the bubble houses. The 
bubble cities, too. It meant real 
estate in practically continental 
lots. It meant the private roads, 
belt lines, power reactors . 

It wasn’t a very funny joke. 
The shiny-eyed boy said 
abruptly, “The ‘L’ stands for 
Lavin. Did you happen to know 
that?” 

Mundin tried to glower. He 
couldn’t. Suppose — just suppose 
— that maybe it wasn’t a joke. 
Ridiculous, of course, but just 
suppose — 

G-M-L Homes. 

Such things didn’t happen to 
Charles' Mundin, Ll.B. “I’m not 
licensed to practice corporate 
law,” he said flatly. “Try William 
Choate the Fourth.” 

“We just did. He said no.” " 
They made it sound real, Mun- 
din thought admiringly. Of 
course, it couldn’t be. Somewhere 
it was written — Charles Mundin 
will never get a fat case. There- 
fore, this thing would piffle out. 
“Well?” demanded the girl. 

“I said I’m not licensed to 
practice corporate law.” 

“Did you think we didn’t know 
that? We dug up an old banger 
who still has his license. He can’t 
work, but we can use his name 
as attorney of record.” 

“Well,” he began hazily, “it’s 
naturally interesting — ” 



“Yes or no?” 

Dworcas stuck his head in 
again. “Mundin, I’m awfully 
sorry, but I’ve got to have the 
office for a while. Why don’t you 
and your friends go over to Hus- 
sein’s for a cup of coffee?” 

“Sure, Del,” Mundin said 
dazedly. “Thanks. Ah — ^will I get 
any broadcast time?” 

“Afraid not this time, Charlie. 
They cut us down to fifteen min- 
utes and old man Ribicoff showed 
up and we had to give him five. 
You know how he is.” 

“Yeah. Thanks for trying, 
Del.” 

H USSEIN’S place, across the 
street, was pretty full, but 
they found a low table on the 
aisle. 

The old-timers in fezzes stared 
at the strange conditioned face of 
Don Lavin. The kids in scat hats 
with five-inch brims looked once 
and then away, quickly. 

Norma Lavin got no stares at 
all. Young and old, the Ay-rabs 
looked coldly through her. Mun- 
din suddenly realized that he was 
doing his political chances no 
good by being seen in public 
with her. The Ay-rabs blamed 
modem women — quite wrongly, 
as it happened — for the discon- 
certing way their own women 
were changing. 

Hussein himself came over. 
“Always a pleasure, Mr. Mun- 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



23 



din,” he beamed. “What will you 
have?” 

“Coffee, please,” Mundin said. 
Don Lavin shook his head ab- 
sently. Norma said nothing. 

“Majun for the lady?” Hus- 
sein asked blandly. “Fresh from 
Mexico this week. Very strong. 
Peppermint, raspberry, grape?” 

Norma Lavin icily said, “No.” 
Hussein went away, still beaming. 
He had delivered a complicated 
triple insult — ^by calling her a 
lady, offering her a narcotic and, 
at that, one traditionally beloved 
by Islamic women denied love by 
ugliness or age. 

Mundin masked his nervous- 
ness by studying his watch. “We 
have about ten minutes,” he said. 
“If you can give me an idea of 
what you have in mind — ” 

Somebody coming down the 
aisle stumbled over Don Lavin’s 
foot. 

“I beg your pardon,” Lavin 
said automatically. 

“What’s the idea of tripping 
me?” asked a bored voice. It was 
a cop — a big man with an in- 
telligent, good-humored face. 

“It was an accident. Officer,” 
Mundin said. 

“Here we go again,” Norma 
Lavin muttered. 

“I was talking to this gentle- 
man, I believe.” The cop asked 
Don Lavin again, “I said what’s 
the idea of tripping me? You a 
cop-hater or something?” 



“I’m really very sorry,” Lavin 
answered dreamily. “Please ac- 
cept my apology.” 

“He won’t,” Norma Lavin 
whispered angrily to Mundin. 

“Officer,” Mundin said sharply, 
“it was an accident. I’m Charles 
Mundin, candidate for the Coun- 
cil in the 27th, Regular Repub- 
lican. I’ll vouch for this gentle- 
man.” 

Ignoring him, the policeman 
said to Lavin, “Suppose we show 
some identification, cop-hater.” 

T AVIN took out a wallet and 
^ spilled cards on the table. 
The cop inspected them and 
growled, “Social Security account 
card says you’re Donald W. 
Lavin, but Selective Service reg- 
istration says you’re Don Lavin, 
no middle initial. And I see your 
draft registration is with an 
Omaha board, but you have a 
resident’s parking permit for 
Coshocton, Ohio.” 

Lavin said somnolently, “I’m 
extremely sorry. Officer.” 

The cop decisively scooped up 
the cards and said, “You’d better 
come along with me, Lavin. Your 
career of crime has gone far 
enough. It’s a lucky thing I 
tripped over you.” 

Mundin noted that he had 
dropped the pretense of being 
tripped. “Officer, I’m taking your 
shield number. I’m going to tell 
my very good friend Del Dworcas 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



about this nonsense. Shortly after 
that, you’ll find yourself on foot 
patrol in Belly Rave — ^the two- 
to-ten shift — unless you care to 
apologize and get the hell out of 
here.” 

The officer shrugged. “What 
can I do? When I see the law 
broken, I have my job to do. 
Come along. Dangerous Don.” 
Lavin smiled distantly at his 
sister, and went along. 

Mundin’s voice was shaking 
with anger. “Don’t worry,” he 
told Norma Lavin. “I’ll have him 
out of the station house right 
after the meeting. And that cop 
is going to wish he hadn’t been 
born.” 

“Never mind. I’ll get him out,” 
she said. “Five times in three 
weeks. I’m used to it.” 

“What’s the angle?” Mundin 
exploded. 

Hussein came up with coffee in 
little cups. “Nice fella, that Jim- 
my Lyons,” he said chattily. 
“For cop, that is.” 

“Who is he?” Mundin snapped. 
“Precinct captain’s man. Very 
good to know. The uniform is just 
patrolman, but when you talk to 
Jimmy Lyons, you talk right into 
precinct captain’s ear.” 

Norma Lavin stood up. “I’m 
going to get my brother sprung 
before they start shunting him 
around the precincts again.” Her 
voice was weary. “I suppose this 
is the end of the road, Mundin. 



But if you still want to consider 
taking our case, here’s the ad- 
dress. Unfortunately, there’s no 
phone.” She hesitated. “I hope 
you’ll — ” It was almost a cry for 
help. 

She bit off the words, dropped 
a coin and a card on the table and 
strode from the coffee shop. The 
Ay-rabs looked icily through her 
as she went. 

Mundin sat at the little table, 
bespelled, turning her card over 
in his fingers. G-M-L Homes, he 
thought. Corporate practice. It’s 
not generally known that the “L” 
stands for Lavin. 

And a cry for help. 

The card said Norma Lavin, 
with an address in Coshocton, 
Ohio, and a phone number. These 
were scratched out, and written 
in was 37598 Willowdale Crescent. 

An address in Belly Rave! 

Mundin shook his head in- 
voluntarily. But there had been 
a cry for help. 

^^HE big free rally, attended 
by perhaps eighty-five voters, 
went off on dreary schedule. 
Mundin managed to see Dworcas 
for a moment after things broke 
up. “Del, what’s with these Lavin 
people? What do you know about 
them?” 

“Not a hell of a lot, Charlie. 
I thought I was throwing some 
business your way. They men- 
tioned a stockholder’s suit. Are 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



25 



they phonies or crackpots?” 
“Maybe. I don’t know. But 
some cop named Jimmy Lyons 
picked the kid up in Hussein’s. 
No reason that I could see.” 
“Jimmy Lyons? He’s the cap- 
tain’s man. I’ll call and see what 
I can do about that, Charlie.” 

He called and came back, smil- 
ing. “The sister identified him. 
They held him a couple of hours 
to cool him off and let him go. 
Lyons just got sore because the 
kid gave him some lip. What the 
hell, cops are human. Charlie, 
maybe you’d better forget about 
these people. The desk man said 
the kid was conditioned or doped 
up or something.” 

“Conditioned, I think. The wise 
kids at Hussein’s kind of eyed 
him fast, if you know what I 
mean.” 

“Sure, Charlie, sure.” Del was 
beginning to look uncomfortable. 
Mundin let him go. 

IV 

TT HAD been a trying evening 
for Norvie Bligh. When he 
walked in on Virginia and her 
daughter, they had been perfectly 
normal — sullen. His news about 
the lawyer, Mundin, and the 
prospects of adopting Alexandra 
had produced the natural effects. 
“You forgot to ask about the 
inheritance.'” 

Before he finished dinner, he 



was driven to the point of shriek- 
ing at his wife, slapping the girl 
and slamming out of the house. 

But there was always Arnie 
Dworcas. 

He killed time for half an hour 
— Arnie didn’t like it if you got 
there too early — and then hur- 
ried. He was almost out of breath 
as he got to Dworcas’ door. 

And Arnie was warmly friend- 
ly. Norvell began at last to relax. 

It wasn’t just a matter of 
plenty of beer and the friendly 
feeling of being with someone you 
liked. Arnie was going out of his 
way, Norvell saw at once, to get 
at the roots of Norvell’s problem. 
As soon as they had had a couple 
of beers, he turned the conversa- 
tion to Norvell’s work. “They 
must be really beginning to roll 
on the Field Day,” he speculated. 

Norvell expanded. “Sure. I’ve 
got some pretty spectacular 
things lined up for it, too. Of 
course, Candella hasn’t given me 
the final go-ahead — ” he frowned 
at a submerged memory — “but 
it’s going to be quite a program. 
One gets a big charge out of do- 
ing one’s best on a big job, Arnie. 
I guess you know that. I remem- 
ber a couple of years ago — ” 

Dworcas interrupted. “More 
beer?” He dialed refills. “Your 
place has quite a good reputa- 
tion,” he said with sober approv- 
al. “This afternoon, in the shop. 
We Engineers were talking about 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the technical factors involved.” 
“You were?” Norvell was pleas- 
ed. “That’s interesting, Arnie. 
This time I was talking about — ” 
“Especially the big shows,” 
Dworcas went on. “The Field 
Days. You know what would be 
interesting, Norvell? Getting a 
couple of the fellows to go to one, 
to see just how the thing looked 
from the engineering viewpoint. 
I’d like to go myself — if I could 
get away, of course. We’re pretty 
busy these days. Might invite a 
few of the others in the shop to 
come along.” 

“You would?” Norvell cried. 
“Say, that would be fine. There’s 
a lot of engineering connected 
with a Field Day. Like this time 
a couple of years — ” 

“Excuse me,” Arnie interrupt- 
ed. “Beer. Be right back.” 

W HILE Dworcas was gone, 
Norvell felt actually cheer- 
ful. Arnie was concerned with his 
work. You didn’t find many 
friends like Arnie. Warmed by 
the beer, Norvell re-examined 
his recent blinding depression. 
Hell, things weren’t too bad. 

He had almost decided to have 
a swift cup of black coffee and go 
home when Arnie came back, 
beaming. “Well, what say. Emo- 
tional Engineer? Want a couple 
of real, live slide-rulers to look 
over your show?” 

“What? Oh, sure, Arnie. Just 



let me get this Field Day out of 
the way. We’ll throw a real party 
— one of the Friday-night shows. 
There’s a lot of complicated stuff 
under the stadium. You’d be in- 
terested — ” 

“I don’t know,” Dworcas said 
doubtfully, “whether the fellows 
would be interested in one of the 
second-rate shows. Maybe we 
ought to skip it.” 

“No, no! The regular shows are 
just as interesting technically. 
Why, just last week, we had a 
broken-field run — barbed wire 

and maimer mines and half 

an hour before the show started, 
the director came around, crying 
that he didn’t have enough men 
for the spectacle. Well, Candella 
— that is, we put in a quick call to 
the cops and they sent a squad 
down to Belly Rave. Got twenty- 
five volunteers in fifteen minutes. 
The orderlies lined ’em up and 
gave them million-unit injections 
of Bi.” He chuckled. “Arnie, you 
should have seen some of those 
guys when they sobered up. We 
had to — ” 

Arnie was shaking his head. 
“That sort of thing isn’t what We 
Engineers are interested in. It’s 
the big effects.” 

“Oh! You mean like in the 
Field Day next week.” Norvell 
thought vaguely about the Field 
Day. “Yeah,” he said uncertainly, 
“there certainly are plenty of 
headaches when you run a Field 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



27 



Day. Can I have another beer, 
please?” 

▲ S he dialed another glass, 
Dworcas said sunnily, “Sup- 
pose you fit us in, then. After all, 
you’ve got eighty thousand seats. 
There ought to be five somewhere 
that the man who runs the whole 
damn thing can give to a friend.” 
“Sure,” Norvell mumbled. “Uh 
— my turn. Excuse me, Arnie.” 
When he came back, the room 
wasn’t spinning quite so dizzily, 
but the warmth in his body was- 
n’t so gratifying, either. He stared 
so long at the glass of beer by his 
chair that Amie thought it was 
flat and pressed a replenishment 
button. 

“Oh, thanks,” Norvell said, 
startled. He picked up the glass 
and took a sip, then put it down 
hard. Half of it slopped over. 
Above the whistle of the suction 
cleaners draining the spilled beer, 
Norvell said with sudden misery, 
“Arnie, I’m in trouble.” 

Dworcas froze. He said care- 
fully, “Trouble?” 

“I swear to God, if it weren’t 
for people like you — if it weren’t 
for you personally — I don’t know 
what I’d do!” He told Dworcas 
about the grisly dinner with his 
wife and stepdaughter, about the 
countless run-ins with Candella, 
about all the fights and frustra- 
tions. “The worst was this morn- 
ing, just before I went to that 



lawyer. I was chewing out that 
little punk Stimmens when Can- 
della walked into the room. He 
must’ve heard every word I said, 
because when I turned around 
and saw him, he said, ‘Excellent 
advice, Mr. Bligh, I hope you’ll 
follow it yourself.’ And Stimmens 
just stood there, laughing at me. 
I couldn’t do a thing. For two 
cents, I would have gone in and 
asked for my contract.” 

Dworcas nodded precisely. 
“Perhaps you should have.” 
“What? Oh, no, Arnie, you 
don’t understand. General Recre- 
ations is lousy on that. They 
won’t sell unless they can get 
their pound of flesh, and plenty 
more besides. We had a vice pres- 
ident once, a couple of years ago, 
got in Dutch with the board and 
wanted out. Well, they set a price 
of four hundred thousand dollars 
on his contract. He killed himself. 
It was that or cancel.” 

“That’s a point to remember, 
Norvell. In any engineering prob- 
lem, there are always at least two 
components to any vector.” 

“I see what you mean. There’s 
no way out.” 

“No, Norvell, there are always 
two ways out, sometimes more.” 
“Well—” 

“At the shop,” Arnie said, lean- 
ing back, “these problems don’t 
arise, of course. Not like with 
you temperamental artists. But 
when I was a journeyman, I . 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Well, it was rough. I know just 
what it’s like. And, of course, 
I know what / would do.” 

“What?” 

“If it were my decision. I’d 
cancel.” 

l^ORVELL goggled. He was 
^ suddenly sober. “You’d can- 
cel?” 

“That’s right,” said Arnie. “I’d 
cancel.” 

Norvell looked at him unbe- 
lievingly, bur Dworcas’ gaze was 
calm and benign. 

“It’s a tough decision to make, 
Norvell. Heaven knows. I’d find 
it a hard one to make myself, 
without half an hour or more of 
serious thought. But what’s your 
alternative?” 

Norvell shifted uncomfortably 
in his chair. He put his beer down. 
Neither man said a word for a 
long time, while Norvell’s mind 
raced from Candella to Dworcas 
to the lawyer, Mundin, to Vir- 
ginia, to Stimmens, to a fire-red 
mystery marked “Belly Rave,” 
to the old man who had sat weep- 
ing while he waited for the brok- 
en-field event to start. 

“I don’t think I ought to,” Nor- 
vell said faintly. 

Dworcas inclined his head. “It’s 
your decision.” 

“I just don’t see how I can, 
Arnie. I’d lose the house, Virginia 
would raise holy — ” 

Arnie stopped him. “You may 



be right. Who knows? There’s 
certainly no security in the world 
for a man without a contract job. 
You’d have to leave your home, 
true, and move to the suburbs — ” 
Norvell blinked — “at least tem- 
porarily. It’s a hard life there, a 
constant challenge to prove your- 
self — to make your way in spite 
of hell or high water — or fall by 
the wayside.” He looked spec- 
ulatively at Norvell and dismis- 
sed the subject. “I just wanted to 
give you the benefit of my think- 
ing on the point. You do as you 
see fit. I guess you’ll want to be 
getting home.” 

“Sure,” Norvell said. “Oh, I 
meant to thank you for steering 
me to that lawyer. I don’t know 
what I would have — ” 

“Think nothing of it. I’m al- 
ways glad to do anything I can 
for you, you know that. You 
won’t forget about the tickets?” 

“Tickets?” Norvell asked va- 
cantly. 

“The tickets for the Field Day. 
Not general admission, you know. 
As close to the Master’s box as 
you can get them.” 

Norvell’s eyes opened wide. He 
said in a thin voice, “Arnie, you 
were bragging to your boss that 
you could get tickets, even though 
they’ve been sold out for six 
weeks. Isn’t that it?” They stared 
nakedly at each other; then Nor- 
vell’s eyes fell. “Just kidding,” 
he mumbled. “I’ll get them.” 



GLADIATOR AT LAW

"17IRGINIA was still awake, but 
* there was only a minor squab- 
ble over the music coming from 
behind Alexandra’s locked door. 
Norvell made the mistake of 
commenting that it was past mid- 
night and a 14-year-old -should 
be asleep. 

His wife said furiously, “Should 
be this, and should be that, and 
should do everthing Mr. Bligh 
wants her to. This whole house 
isn’t organized around you. It’s 
our home, too, and — ’’ 

Norvell had had all he could 
take. “It’s the company’s house 
and one more word out of you 
and I give it back to them. Then 
you two prize packages from Bel- 
ly Rave will be right back where 
you belong.” 

Virginia’s face stiffened in 
shocked surprise. Norvell stalked 
downstairs to the bar and poured 
himself a drink. 

He sat with it in his hand and 
looked in sudden wonder af the 
room around him. 

Was there so much difference 
between a G-M-L bubble house 
and Belly Rave? He decided he’d 
have to visit Belly Rave one of 
these days. Just to get a look. 
But what could the difference be? 

A house was a house. If you 
didn’t like the floor warm, you 
dialed it to cool. If you didn’t 
like the wall color or pattern, 
you turned the selector wheel 
to something else. If you didn’t 



like a room plan, you clipped the 
wall somewhere else. 

Norvell dialed a bed and set 
the house to full automatic. As 
he lay down, his pillow chimed 
softly, but he didn’t need sleepy 
music that night. He reached over 
his head and turned it off. 

In the copper plexus at the 
house’s core, transistors pulsed, 
solenoids barred the doors, micro- 
switches laid traps for intruders, 
thermocouples dried the incoming 
air and cooled it. Commutator 
points would boil the water 
for the coffee in the morning, heat 
the griddle for the eggs, set their 
breakfast dishes. 

Naturally — Norvell thought 
sleepily — that’s what a house was. 

V 

T?OUR taxi drivers flatly refus- 
ed to take Mundin to Belly 
Rave. The fifth was a reckless 
youngster. “Just took this job 
waiting for the draft call,” he 
confided. “How can I lose? You’re 
paying plenty and maybe I’ll 
get beat up so bad in this here 
Belly Rave place that they won’t 
draft me.” He laughed. “Fact is. 
I’ve never been out there, but I 
figure it can’t be as tough as they 
say.” 

Mundin did not contradict him, 
though he felt a lot less certain, 
and off they went. 

There was no sizable city that 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



did not have the equivalent of 
Belly Rave. Festering slums that 
had once been respectable subur- 
ban residential sections, like Belle 
Reve Estates, they had been 
abruptly made obsolete by the 
G-M-L bubble houses — good 
enough for derelicts to live in, 
not good enough to keep in re- 
pair. The battered streetlights, 
Mundin noticed, didn’t light; the 
yards were weed-grown; roofs 
were rotted through, walls sag- 
ging. 

To one who had always lived 
in bubble houses, the place was 
shocking. He had thought the 
early bubble houses were ludi- 
crous because the automatic con- 
trols sometimes went out of order 
and manual ones had to be used 
temporarily. But these primitive 
structures — even someone like 
himself, with no more than a lay- 
man’s knowledge, saw instantly 
that this old-style architecture 
must have taken an incredible 
number of man-hours just for 
upkeep. 

He asked himself indignantly 
why this architectural jungle was- 
n’t torn or burned down and bub- 
ble houses put up. He knew the 
answer, of course — G-M-L 
Homes. They could manufacture 
the units, but their advertising 
explained why they didn’t. Living 
in a bubble house was a mark 
of success. And so they limited 
production, maintained an arti- 



ficial scarcity value . and doom- 
ed people to Belly Raves, or 
whatever the local name was, in 
every city. 

Hell with it, Mundin thought 
in annoyance; he had his own 
troubles. He hadn’t come out to 
Belly Rave to worry about it; he 
was there on a job. // he was 
lucky and it turned into a real, 
honest-to-God case. 

There was life in Belly Rave — 
a furtive, crepuscular life called 
into being by the unpoliceable 
wilderness of tall weeds, wrecks 
of homes, endless miles of crum- 
bling pavement. Scatty little cars 
prowled the cracked roads, occa- 
sionally pulling to the curb when 
a dim figure swung a phospho- 
rescent handbag. 

r^HE taxi passed one block of 
houses that was a blaze of 
light and noise. A doorman trot- 
ted alongside the cab, urging, 
“Anything goes, mister. Spend 
the night for five bucks, all you 
can drink and smoke included. 
Why pay taxes, mister?” 

Sometimes, though not often, 
the Alcohol 86 Hemp Tax Unit 
raided such joints. 

The driver asked, “We any- 
where near 37598 Willowdale 
Crescent?” 

“What you need is a guide,” 
the doorman said promptly. 
“Jimmy!” Somebody jelled out 
of the dark. Mundin heard a fum- 



GIADI ATOR AT LAW 



31 



bling at the cab door. 

“Step on it!” he yelled at the 
driver, snapping the door lock. 
The driver stepped on it. 

Ambush left behind, they cau- 
tiously approached bag-swingers 
for directions and before long 
were on the 37,000 block of 
Willowdale Crescent, counting 
houses. 

“This must be it,” said the 
driver, no longer devil-may-care. 

“I guess so. Wait here, will 
you?” 

“No, sir! How do I know you 
ain’t going to slip through a 
back door? You pay me what’s 
on the clock and I’ll wait.” 



The meter read a whopping 
eight dollars. Mundin handed 
over a ten and started up the 
crumbled walk. 

The taxi zoomed away before 
he had taken half a dozen steps. 
Mundin cursed wearily and 
knocked on the door. He studied 
the boarded-up picture window 
while he waited. Like all the oth- 
ers, it was broken, boarded up. 
Inevitably, in the years that had 
gone by since they were eased and 
puttied carefully into place, the 
rock had been flung, or the door 
had been slammed, or the drunk 
had lurched into the living room. 

The man who came to the door

was old and visibly sick. 

“Is this the Lavin place?” 
Mundin asked, blinking against 
a light haze of wood-smoke. ‘Tm 
Charles Mundin. She asked me 
to call in connection with a legal 
matter. I’m an attorney.” 

The old man started at the 
word. “Come in. Counselor,” he 
said formally. “I am a member 



of the bar myself — ” 

He broke off into a fit of cough- 
ing that left him leaning against 
the door. 

l^TUNDIN half carried him into 
the living room and eased 
him into a sagging, overstuffed 
chair. A Coleman lamp, blowing 
badly, cast a metallic blue-green

glare into every corner of the 
room. A fire smoldered in the 
hearth, billowing against a closed 
register. A tinny radio was blar- 
ing, “ — ^was kept from spreading, 
though the four houses involved 
in the arson attempt were totally 
destroyed. Elsewhere in Belly 
Rave, warfare broke out between 
the Wabbits and the Goddams, 
rival junior gangs. One eight- 
year-old was killed instantly by 
a thrown — ” 

Mundin clicked it off and open- 
ed the register. The smoke began 
to clear from the room and the 
fire to flicker. The old man was 
still folded up in the chair, 
his parchment face mercilessly 
bleached by the flaring light. 
Mundin fiddled aimlessly with 
the valve and somehow got it to 
stop roaring. There was a green 
glass shade; he put it on and the 
room was suddenly no longer a 
corner of a surrealist hell, but 
simply a shabby room. 

“Thank you,” the old man 
muttered. “Counselor, would you 
please see if there is a small, 
round tin in the bathroom cab- 
inet?” 

The bathtub was full of split 
kindling and the cabinet shelves 
loaded with the smaller house- 
hold staples — salt, spices and 
such. There was an unmarked 
tin, which Mundin pried open. 
Small, gummy-looking pills and 
an unmistakable odor — yen pox! 



He shuddered and brought it out. 

The old man took it and slowly 
swallowed five of the opium pills. 
When he spoke, his voice was al- 
most steady. “Thank you. Coun- 
selor. And let this be a lesson to 
you. It’s weakening, humiliating. 
You said you had an appoint- 
ment with Norma? She should 
have been here hours ago. Nat- 
urally — this neighborhood — I’m 
worried. I’m Harry Ryan. Mem- 
ber of the S.E.C. Bar and other 
things. Of course — ” he stared at 
the tin of yen pox — “I’m retired 
from practice.” 

Mundin coughed. “Miss Lavin 
mentioned you, though not by 
name. You would be attorney of 
record and I’d do the legwork 
in some sort of stockholder’s suit, 
right?” 

Ryan nodded. Mundin hesitat- 
ed, then went on to tell the old 
man about the arrest in Hussein’s 
place. 

“VT’ES,” Ryan said matter-of- 
factly. “I told her it was a 
mistake to go to Mr. Dworcas. 
It is inconceivable that Green, 
Charlesworth would neglect to 
have an understanding with the 
Regular Republican Central 
Committee.” 

Green, Charlesworth was the 
name of an investment house us- 
ually mentioned in hushed and 
tremulous tones. Mundin said, 
“She told me it was connected 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with G-M-L Homes. How does 
Green, Charlesworth come into 
it?” 

Ryan chewed another opium 
pill. “Not in more than two dozen 
ways — that I know of.” He ac- 
tually smiled. “Raw materials, 
belt transport patents, real estate, 
insurance, plant financing — ” He 
heaved himself from the over- 
stuffed chair as the door knocker 
rattled. “I’ll get it,” he said. “It 
was just a temporary indisposi- 
tion. You needn’t mention it to 
. ” He jerked his chin at the 
door. 

He came back into the living 
room with Norma and Don Lav- 
in. 

“Hello, Mundin,” she said 
tonelessly. “I see you found us. 
Have you eaten?” 

“Yes, thanks.” 

“Then excuse us while we have 
something. The Caddy broke 
down five times on the way out 
here. I’m beat.” 

She and her brother morosely 
opened a couple of self-heating 
cans of goulash. They spooned 
them down in silence. 

“Now,” she said to Mundin, 
“the background. I’ll make it 
short. Don and I were born of 
rich but honest parents in Cosh- 
octon, Ohio. Daddy — Don, seni- 
or — was rather elderly when we 
came along. He spent the first 
fifty years of his life working. He 
started out as a plastics man 



with a small factory — bus bodies, 
fire trucks, that kind of thing. He 
happened to have gone to school 
with a man named Bernie Gor- 
man, who happened to have spe- 
cialized in electronics and electri- 
cal stuff. The two of them worked 
together, when they could find 
time, dreaming dreams and weav- 
ing visions. They were dedicated 
men. They invented, designed and 
constructed the first pilot model 
of the G-M-L Home, otherwise 
known as the bubble house.” 

Mundin said frostily, “I hap- 
pen to know a little about G-M- 
L, Miss Lavin. Wasn’t there a 
man named Moffatt involved?” 

“Not until later — much later. 
For almost thirty years. Daddy 
and Mr. Gorman starved them- 
selves, gave up everything for 
their dream. Mother said she 
scarcely saw Daddy from month’s 
end to month’s end. Mr. Gorman 
died a bachelor. They had de- 
signed the bubble house, they had 
built it, but they didn’t have the 
capital to put it on the market.” 

1%^UNDIN objected, “They 
■I-’-*- could have leased the 
rights.” 

“And had them bottled up,” 
she said. “Didn’t I tell you they 
were dedicated men? They had 
designed a home that was cheaper 
than the cheapest and better than 
the best. It was a breakthrough 
in housing, like nothing that had 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



35 



gone before except, perhaps the 
revolution in synthetic textiles. 
Don’t you see that even a million- 
aire could not have owned a bet- 
ter house? Daddy and Mr. 
Gorman wanted to give their 
dream to the people at a reason- 
able profit. They weren’t big busi- 
nessmen, Mundin — they were 
dreamers. They were out of their 
field. Then Moffatt came along 
with his plan.” 

Ryan stirred himself. “Most 
ingenious, really. By leasing man- 
ufacturing rights to large corp- 
orations, G-M-L avoided capital 
outlay: the cprporations gave 
their employees what could not 
be had elsewhere — and good-by to 
labor troubles. At first, G-M-L 
leased the rights for money. 
Later, when they got bigger, the 
consideration was blocks of stock, 
equities in the leasing firms.” 
The girl nodded soberly. 
“Within ten years, it owned siz- 
able shares of forty corporations, 
and Daddy and Mr. Gorman 
owned half of G-M-L. Then 
Daddy found out what was hap- 
pening. He told Mr. Gorman and 
I think it killed him — he was an 
old man by then, you see. Con- 
tract status. One word of back- 
talk and you get thrown out of 
your G-M-L house. Get thrown 
out of your G-M-L house and 
you find yourself — here.” 

Mundin said wonderingly, 
“But if your father was one of 



the owners of the company — ” 

“Only twenty-five per cent, 
Mundin. And Mr. Gorman’s 
twenty-five per cent went to dis- 
tant cousins. So there was Daddy, 
at sixty-five. His vision was a 
reality — his bubble homes housed 
a hundred million people. But 
they had become a weapon and 
he was frozen out of the firm.” 

Don Lavin said dreamily, 
“They gave the plant guards his 
picture. He was arrested for 
drunk and disorderly when he 
tried to go to the stockholders’ 
meeting. He hanged himself in 
his cell.” He stared absently at 
Mundin’s shoe. 

Mundin cleared his throat, 
“I’m sorry. Wasn’t there anything 
to be done at all?” 

T>YAN said, with a touch of 
professional admiration, 
“Very little, Mr. Mundin. Oh, he 
still had stock. They impounded 
it. A trumped-up creditors’ com- 
mittee got an order on his safe- 
deposit box against dissipation of 
assets when he died. They kept it 
impounded for twelve years. Then 
somebody got careless, or some- 
body quit or got fired, and the 
new man didn’t know what the 
impoundment was for. Anyway, 
the order expired. Norma and 
Don Lavin are twenty-five per 
cent owners of G-M-L.” 

Mundin looked around the 
shabby room and said nothing. 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“There’s just one little thing,” 
Norma said bitterly. “Don got 
the stock out of the box and 
put it away. Tell us where it is, 
Don.” 

The brother’s dreamy eyes 
widened. His face worked wildly. 
He said, “K-k-k-k-k-k” in a 
convulsion of stammering. The 
terrified stutter went on and on, 
and then Don Lavin began rasp- 
ingly to cry. Norma, stone-faced, 
patted him on the shoulder. 

OHE said to the appalled law- 
^ yer, “When we began making 
trouble, as they called it, Don 
was snatched. He was gone for 
three days. A doctor he went to 
says he must have got more than 
fifty hours of conditioning.” 

“That’s illegal! Private persons 
can’t use conditioning tech- 
niques!” 

“You’re our lawyer now — just 
straighten that out for us, will 
you? Get an injunction against 
G-M-L.” 

Mundin sat back. Habitual 
criminals — like his client earlier 
in the day — ^were conditioned in 
twenty hours of treatment spread 
over a week or more. Good God, 
fifty hours in three days! But 
proving it against G-M-L or any- 
one else — ^that was the hard part. 
The conditioned person was na- 
turally conditioned against tak- 
ing any action of the sort. 

He felt ill. “Sorry I was so 



stupid. So now you want to find 
the stock and Don doesn’t know 
where he put it.” 

Ryan looked at him with dis- 
gust. “I could manage to get 
duplicate certificates. Unfortun- 
ately, our position is not that 
simple. Donald, as the male heir, 
was the obvious person to con- 
duct a suit, so Norma signed an 
irrevocable proxy of interest to 
him. That was an error, as it 
turned out. Donald can’t bring 
suit. He can’t tell us where the 
stock is. He can’t even discuss it.” 
Mundin nodded sickly. “I see. 
You’re stymied.” 

Norma made a contemptuous 
noise. “Now that it’s established 
that we’re licked, we might as 
well lie down and die.” 

“I didn’t say that. Miss La- 
vin. We’ll do what we can.” He 
hesitated. “For instance, no 
doubt we can have your brother 
undergo a deconditioning course 
somewhere else. After all — ” 

“ ‘Private persons can’t use 
conditioning techniques,’ ” she 
quoted derisively. “Didn’t you 
say that just a moment ago?” 
“Well, yes, but surely someone 
will—” 

Norma seemed to collapse. 
She said to Ryan, “You tell him 
what he’s up against.” 

Ryan said, “G-M-L’s assets 
are not less than fourteen billion 
dollars, comprising cash in the 
bank, negotiable securities, plant 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



37 



and properties and equities, as 
of their last statement, in eight 
hundred and four corporations. 
I don’t say that they can break 
the law with impunity. Coun- 
selor, but they can sure as hell 
keep us from breaking it.” 

OURTEEN billion dollars! 
Mundin, trudging apprehen- 
sively through Belly Rave’s dark 
streets, felt very small, pitted 
against fourteen billion dollars. 

A mournful hooting from the 
shadows made him quicken his 
step, but no lurking thugs show- 
ed up. Mundin shivered uncom- 
fortably and turned up his coat 
collar. It had begun to rain. 

Luck was with him. He was 
neither mugged nor lured into 
one of the clip joints. The foot- 
pads were stalking other streets; 
the roving gangs of armed ado- 
lescents plotted in their cellars 
instead of braving the rain; the 
cab Mundin spotted, ran after 
and hailed was a legitimate cab, 
not a trap. 

The ride gave him time to 
think. But the thinking came to 
very little. The Lavins, he was 
convinced, had a legitimate 
claim. He had promised them he 
would work on it; he had tried 
to reassure them that things 
were not as hopeless as they 
seemed. He felt uncomfortably 
sure that the girl had seen 
through his empty words. 



The cab came at last to terri- 
tory he recognized and he stop- 
ped it at an all-night restaurant. 
Coffee might help, he thought. 
While he was waiting for it, he 
invested in a call to his office — 
you could never tell, maybe 
someone had phoned. 

Someone had. The Sleepless 
Secretary groaned and came 
across with the record of a fa- 
miliar, scared voice; “Mr. Mun- 
din — uh — this is Norvell Bligh. 
Can you come and get me out 
of jail?” 

VI 

I^ORVIE woke up with a 

' start. They were joggling 
him, with identical, contemptu- 
ous smiles. Even in the fog of 
sleep, he felt a little stab of 
pride at Virginia’s beauty, a 
twitch of unhappiness at the 
same lean beauty smothered be- 
neath the adolescent fat of her 
daughter. 

“What’s the matter?” he 
croaked. 

His voice sounded odd and he 
realized he wasn’t wearing his 
hearing aid. He groped for it be- 
side the bed. It wasn’t there. 
He sat up. 

He yelled at Alexandra, 
“Where is it? If you’ve hidden 
it again. I’ll break your neck!” 

Alexandra looked smugly 
shocked. She mouthed at him.

“Goodness, Norvell, you know I 
wouldn’t do that,” though he had 
repeatedly told her that exagger- 
ation made it impossible to read 
lips. 

Virginia tapped him on the 
shoulder and said something, 
stiff -lipped. He caught an “eep” 
and a “larm.” 

“What?” 

“I said you must have come in 
too drunk to set the alarm be- 
fore you went to sleep. Get up. 
You’re an hour late for work 
now.” 

He leaped from bed. An hour 
late on this day, of all days! 

He found the hearing aid — 
on the floor in the entrance hall, 
where he couldn’t have left it, 
any more than he could have 
failed to set the alarm. But he 
didn’t have time to take up these 
minor points. He depilated in 
ten seconds, bathed in five, dress- 
ed in fifteen and shot out of the 
house. 

Fortunately Candella wasn’t 
in. Norvie sent Miss Dali to 
round up his staff and began 
the tooling-up job for the inte- 
grator keyboard, while the pro- 
duction men busied themselves 
with their circuits and their ma- 
trices, and the job began. This 
was the part of Norvie’s work 
that made him, he confessed 
secretly to himself, feel most 
like God. He fed the directions 
to Stimmens, Stimmens fumb- 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



lingly set up the punch cards, the 
engineers translated the cards 
into phase fields and interferer 
circuits . and a World That 
Norvie Made appeared in minia- 
ture. 

He had once tried to explain 
his feelings to Arnie. Arnie had 
snarled something about the pre- 
sumptuous conceit of a mere 
pushbutton. All he did, Arnie 
explained over many glasses of 
beer, was to decide what forms 
and images he wanted to see; 
it was the Engineers who, in 
Their wisdom, transmuted empty 
imaginings into patterns of light 
and color that magically took 
the form and movement of tiny 
fighters and wrestlers and spear- 
carriers. The original thought, 
Arnie explained severely, was 
nothing; it was the tremendous 
technical skill that transformed 
the thought into visual reality 
that was important. And Nor- 
vell, perforce, humbly agreed. 

T?VEN now, he was deferential 
^ to the production men, those 
geniuses so well versed in the 
arts of connecting Circuit A to 
Terminal IV, for they were En- 
gineers. But his deference extend- 
ed only to the technical crew. 
“Stimmens!” he barked. “Hurry 
it up! Mr. Candella will be here 
any moment!” 

“Yessir,” said Stimmens, hope- 
lessly shuffling the stacks of 

39 



notes from Norvell’s hands. 

Stimmens was coming along, 
Norvell thought. A touch of the 
whip was good for him. 

It took twenty minutes and a 
bit more, and then Norvell’s 
whole design for a Field Day was 
on punch cards. While Stimmens 
was correcting his last batch of 
cards, the production men began 
the run-through. The little 
punched cards went through the 
scanners; the packed circuits 
measured voltages and spat elec- 
trons; and in the miniature 
mockup of the Stadium, tiny fi- 
gures of light appeared and 
moved and slew each other and 
left. 

They were Norvell’s own, fea- 
tureless and bright, tiny and in- 
substantial. Where Norvell’s 
script called for the bodies of 
forty javelin-throwers in the 
flesh, the visualizing apparatus 
showed forty sprites of light jab- 
bing at each other with lances of 
fire. No blood spilled; no bodies 
stained the floor of the Stadium; 
only the little bodiless fire-fi- 
gures that disappeared like any 
other pattern of excited ions when 
the current went off. 

Somehow, Norvell thought of 
the Field Days themselves as 
taking place here. He had heard 
the cries of the injured and seen 
the drawn faces of the next of' 
kin; but it was as mannikins that 
he thought of them, always. 




One of the production men said 
approvingly, “Looks like a good 
show, Mr. Bligh.” 

“Thanks,” said Norvell grate- 
fully. It was always a good sign 
when the technical crew hung 
over the miniature stadium this 
way, watching the mockup fig- 
ures go through their paces. 

Now the question was, what 
would Candella say? 

“T>LIGH, the upcoming Field 
Day is important,” was 
what Candella said to Norvie. 
“At least, it seems to me that 
everything we do is important. 
Don’t you think so?”

GLADIATOR AT LAW

Norvell said, “Well, of course!” 
“Our work is important, Bligh. 
It is a great and functional art 
form. It provides healthful en- 
tertainment, satisfying the needs 
of every man for some form of 
artistic expression. It provides 
escape — escape for the hard- 
working bubble-house class, 
escape for the masses of Belly 
Rave. It siphons off their aggres- 
sions. Allotments and Field Days 
— our society is built on them! 
You might call our work the very 
foundation of society. Do you 
agree?” 

“Yes, sir,” Norvie almost 
whispered. 

Candella looked politely apo- 
logetic. “I beg your pardon?” 
“Yes, sir!" Norvell, too late, 
found he was almost bellowing. 

Candella looked pained. “You 
needn’t shout. There is nothing 
wrong with my hearing.” Norvell 
winced. “Foundation of our so- 
ciety, but also an art form. The 
cultured classes appreciate our 
efforts on the artistic plane. The 
rabble of Belly Rave — with all 
respects, my dear Bligh, to the 
origin of your charming wife — 
need it on the glandular level. 
Every show we can produce is 
important. But the Field Day — ” 
His thick brows came down 
like the ragged anvils of thun- 
derclouds. “The Field Day, you 
tin-eared fumbler, is the biggest 
day of the year! Not just because 



it draws the biggest audience — 
but because that's the one I am 
judged by! The Board attends. 
The Mayor attends. The men 
from G-M-L attend. If they like 
it, good. If they don’t — ^that’s my 
neck on the line, Bligh!” 

Norvell opened his mouth. 
“Not a word! I want no ex- 
cuses. Your notion of what con- 
stituted a Field Day was, of 
course, uninspired. But I thought 
that, with patching and impro- 
vising, we might get by. I no ' 
longer think so — not since ex- 
amining the superb presentation 
that was handed me this morn- 
ing — by a member of your own 
staff, Bligh ! A brilliant boy whom 
you have evidently been holding 
down. Thank God he had the 
courage and sense to come to 
me with this masterpiece instead 
of permitting you to destroy it!” 
Norvell was able to croak, 
“Who?” 

“Stimmens.” 

Stimmens? Wet behind the 
ears, untried, simple research? 
Who didn’t even want to stay 
with the firm, who had the in- 
fernal gall to ask for a contract 
release? Stimmens? 

l^ORVELL’S hand stretched 
^ out for the punched cards 
and then he stopped, 

“Go ahead,” Candella said 
coldly. 

Bligh scanned them in aston- 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ishment. Why, he thought, this 
is imjxjssible — and this bit here, 
we can’t — 

“Mind if I play these, Mr. 
Candella?” he asked and, getting 
an ironic nod, fed the punch 
cards into Candella’s machine. 
The circuits scanned the punch- 
es and built a scene of electronic 
slaughter for him. He watched 
the little fire-figures in growing 
apprehension. 

When he looked up, he said, 
so bemused that he hardly re- 
membered to be fearful, “Why, 
it’s good!” 

“Of course it’s good!” 

“Really good, Mr. Candella.” 
He shook his head wonderingly. 
“Stimmens, eh? I never would 
have believed it. Of course, the 
emotional values need bringing 
out. The comedy stuff with the 
vitriol pistols ought to follow a 
tense thriller like Man Versus 
Scorpions, instead of another 
comedy number like the Octo- 
genarians with Flame-throwers. 
But that’s easy enough to fix. 
Race against Manmade Light- 
ning is out, too. Stimmens told 
me himself we couldn’t get the 
equipment from Schenectady. I 
suppose he forgot.” i 

Candella was looking at him 
with an indescribable expression, 
but Norvell raced on. “Real ori- 
ginality, Mr. Candella. I — 1 
must say I admire him. Piranhas 
in the aquatic meet — wonder- 

GLADI ATOR AT LAW 



ful! And the octogenarians are a 
terrific switch. Number after 
number I’ve never heard of! I 
have to admit it, Mr. Candella, 
that boy has talent.” 

“What the hell are you bab- 
bling about?” 

“Why, the — ^the originality, 
Mr. Candella. The freshness.” 
“Originality! Bligh, do you 
think I’m crazy enough to run 
untried novelties in a show like 
this? Every one of these features 
has been a smash success some- 
where in the country within the 
last ninety days.” 

“Oh, no! I’ve been getting all 
the reports and none of this stuff 
— Stimmens was doing the re- 
search himself. He ought to 
know!” 

^ANDELLA exploded. “Look, 
^ you fool!” He tossed a sheaf 
of reports at Norvell. 

They were all there — ^names, 
dates, places. Norvell looked up 
in horror. “It’s a doublecross! 
He wants a Fifteen rating. Just 
yesterday, he tried to get me to 
recommend remission of his con- 
tract. I wouldn’t do it. This is 
his way of getting even.” 

“Bligh, that’s a serious charge!” 
“Oh, I’ll prove it, Mr. Can- 
della. I’ve got the copies of his 
reports locked in my desk.” 
Candella stood up. “Show me,” 
he ordered. 

Ten minutes later, he was say- 

43 



ing grimly, “Thought I wouldn’t 
call your bluff, eh?’’ 

Norvell stared unbelievingly at 
the reports, face white as a sheet. 
They had been in his desk, lock- 
ed with his key. And they were 
not the reports he had seen. They 
sparkled with novelties — all the 
magnificent new concepts in 
Stimmens’ outline and more, 
much more. 

How? He couldn’t have left 
the desk unlocked. Nobody had 
a key but him and Miss Dali — 
and she had no reason to do such 
a thing. Had he gone mad? Was 
it some chemical prank, the re- 
ports he saw in disappearing ink, 
the substituted ones then com- 
ing to light? How? 

Over Norvell’s desk set, Can- 
della was calling Stimmens in. 
The boy appeared, looking awed 
and deferential. 

Mr. Candella said brief- 
ly, “Congratulations, Stimmens. 
You’re the head of the depart- 
ment as of now. Move into your 
office whenever you like — this is 
your office. And throw this bum 
out.” To Norvell: “Your contract 
is canceled for cause. Don’t ever 
try to get a job in this line again; 
you’ll waste your time.” He left 
without another word. 

Stimmens said uneasily, “I 
didn’t have the heart to go 
through with it. I had to give 
you a chance — you turned it 
down.” 



Norvell just stared. 

Stimmens went on defensively, 
“It isn’t as if I just walked into 
it. Believe me, I earned this. 
What do I know about Field 
Days? Sweat, sweat, sweat — I 
haven’t had a moment’s peace.” 
Miss Dali walked in and kiss- 
ed Stimmens, burbling, “Darl- 
ing, I just heard! You wonderful 
Grade Fifteen, you!” 

“Oh,” said Norvell in a sick 
voice. 

They said more, but he didn’t 
hear. It was as if his hearing 
aid were turned off, though, in 
this instance, the switch was not 
in his pocket, but in his mind. 
He was out on the street before 
he realized what he was doing — 
and what had happened to the 
contract career of Norvell Bligh. 

l^ORVELL came up to the 
’ problem of Virginia in his 
thinking and, like a thousand 
times before, he backed away 
from it. He ordered another 
drink. 

No contract status meant no 
bubble house. It also meant Bel- 
ly Rave. Norvell took a deep 
swallow. Still, what was so bad 
about Belly Rave? The allot- 
ments would take care of eating. 
His extra work — ^whatever it 
turned out to be — ^would give 
him a chance to save a little 
money, make a fresh start, may- 
be get back on contract and into 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a bubble house again. After all, 
he was a trained man — an En- 
gineer, in a way. 

He wished once again that he 
knew a little more about Belly 
Rave. Funny, considering that 
Virginia had been born there. 
But she had never wanted to 
talk about it. 

And there he was, back on the 
subject of Virginia. 

How would she take it? He 
really couldn’t guess. She had 
been so resolutely silent on the 
subject of Belly Rave and all it 
concerned. Her childhood, her 
parents, even her husband — ^the 
power-cycle stunter whose crash 
in a long-ago Field Day had left 
young Norvell Bligh with a 
tearless widow to jolly out of 
filing a claim. He had married 
her instead and Candella had 
made an unforgivable joke . 
No, he hadn’t married her — she 
had married, not Norvell Bligh, 
but a contract job and a G-M-L 
house. 

He dialed another drink. Well, 
there was still Arnie. He wasn’t 
the kind of friend to look the 
other way when you were a lit- 
tle down on your luck — not even 
that, really, just temporarily the 
victim of a professional misun- 
derstanding and a doublecross. 
Good old Arnie, Norvell thought 
sentimentally. 

He caught a glimpse of the 
time. Maybe he ought to have 



it out with Virginia, and then go 
over and spend some time with 
Arnie. The thought braced him. 

He swallowed his drink and 
slipped his wallet into the bar 
slot. Having it out with Virginia 
might not be so tough at that. 
The fact that she had been born 
in Belly Rave was an advantage, 
if he could only make her see 
it that way. She’d have friends 
there. She’d have some ideas 
about pleasant, useful work he 
could do to supplement the al- 
lotment until he got on his feet 
again — 

Something crushed his shoul- 
der and spun him around. 
“Whaddya think you’re up to?” 
the policeman demanded. He 
shook the wallet under Norvell 
Bligh’s nose. ‘‘You know the 
penalty for passing a bum pen- 
alty card? You Belly Ravers are 
all alike — find a lapsed card 
and a front and try to get a free 
load. Come along. The Captain 
wants to talk to you.” 

T>LIGH spent a long time try- 
ing to make them believe him 
down at the precinct, before he 
realized they did believe him — 
believed him and just didn’t 
care. 

It was close to dinner time 
and they put him in something 
they called ‘‘the Tank” until the 
desk sergeant got back from his 
meal. Norvell didn’t like the 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



45 



tank and he didn’t like the looks 
of the half-dozen other persons 
who occupied it with him. 

Still, it was only a question 
of his lapsed credit card — they 
could easily have added drunk 
and disorderly to the charge — or 
even no visible means of support, 
which meant getting a job in- 
stantly or being jugged for quite 
a while. And there was only one 
kind of job a man in police 
trouble could pick up a phone 
and get, every time. Usually you 
didn’t have to phone. The cops 
would drive you down to the 
Stadium’s service entrance them- 
selves. Norvell knew the process, 
having seen enough “volunteers” 
delivered. 

“Hey, Bligh.” 

Norvell said, “Yes, sir?” 

The cop opened the door. 
“This way.” They came to a 
dingy room. There was an em- 
barrassing process of holding 
your hands over your head while 
someone searched you. You 
couldn’t blame them, Norvell 
told himself ; they must have had 
plenty of desperate criminals 
here. There was a curiously in- 
teresting process of inking the 
fingers and rolling them across 
a piece of paper. There was a 
mildly painful process of look- 
ing into what seemed to be a 
binocular microscope; a light 
flashed, and Norvell had a little 
trouble seeing. 



While Norvell was blinking 
at the halo in his field of vision, 
the cop said something. Norvell 
said, “What?” 

“I said do you want to call 
your lawyer?” 

Norvell shook his head auto- 
matically. Then he remembered 
— he had a lawyer. “Why, yes,” 
he said. He found Mundin’s 
phone number in the book with 
some difficulty. It was after 
hours, but he was lucky enough 
to get an answer — though Mun- 
din himself wasn’t there and the 
person who answered seemed to 
be drunk or something. But 
Norvell left a message, and then 
there was nothing to do but wait. 

Curiously, the waiting was not 
unpleasant. Even the thought of 
what Virginia would say or do 
about this was not particularly 
terrifying. What worse could 
happen than had already? 

VII 

“r^HANK you very much, Mr. 

Mundin,” Norvell said. He 
looked back at the precinct 
house and shuddered. 

Mundin said, “Don’t thank 
me. I just put in a word with 
Del Dworcas and he put in a 
word with the precinct. Thank 
him.” 

Norvell brightened. “Oh, I in- 
tend to! I’ve wanted to meet 
Mr. Dworcas for a long time. 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



His brother Arnie is a very close 
friend of mine.” 

Mundin shrugged. “Come on, 
then. I’m going to the Hall any- 
how.” 

Mundin stalked sourly ahead 
of his client, his mind on G-M- 
L Homes. The hope kept 
hammering at his good sense — 
maybe he could pull it off. May- 
be .. 

Norvell followed contentedly 
enough through the rain. Every- 
thing was being ordered for him. 
He was out of a job, he had been 
in jail, he was hours and hours 
late for Virginia without a word 
of explanation — but none of it 
had been his own decision. 

Decisions would come later. 
That would be the hard part. 

Norvell stared around the Hall 
curiously. It wasn’t as impres- 
sive as one might expect — though 
maybe, he thought, you had to 
admire the Regular Republicans 
for their common touch. There 
was certainly nothing showy 
about the place. 

Norvell stopped, politely out 
of earshot, as Mundin spoke to 
a dark, sharp-featured man in 
shirt sleeves. Some kind of jani- 
tor, he guessed. He was aston- 
ished when Mundin called him 
over and introduced the man as 
Del Dworcas. 

Norvell said, “I’m really de- 
lighted to meet you, Mr. Dwor- 
cas. Your brother Arnie is very 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



proud of you. He and I are very 
good friends.” 

Dworcas asked irrelevantly, 
“Live around here?” 

“Oh, no. Quite some distance 
away, but — ” 

Dworcas seemed to lose in- 
terest. “Glad to meet you. You 
want to see Arnie, he’s in Hus- 
sein’s, across the street. Now, 
Charles, what was it you wanted 
to see me about?” 

Norvell was left standing with 
his hand extended. He blinked a 
little, but — after all, he remind- 
ed himself, Mr. Dworcas was a 
busy man. 

On the way downstairs, he 
caught a glimpse of the time. It 
was after eleven! 

A RNIE was at a table by him- 
self reading. He looked up as 
Norvell came close and hastily 
put the magazine away. 

Norvell smiled and slipped in- 
to a vacant seat. “Surprised to 
see me?” 

Arnie frowned. “What are you 
doing here?” 

Norvell lost his smile. “Can — 
can I have some coffee, Arnie? 
I came out without any money.” 
Arnie looked mildly outraged, 
but beckoned the grinning waiter. 

Then Norvell told him — about 
the jail, and Mundin, and Del 
Dworcas. 

“You’ve had a busy day,” Ar- 
nie said humorously. “I’m glad 

47 



you met Del, though — he’s a 
prince. Incidentally, I’ve taken 
the liberty of asking a couple of 
associates to the Field Day. So 
when you get the tickets — ” 
“Arnie — ” 

“When you get the tickets, will 
you pick up three extras?” 
“Arnie, listen to me. I can’t 
get the tickets.” 

“You what?” 

“I got fired today. That’s why 
I didn’t have any money.” 



There was a pause. Dworcas 
began looking through his pock- 
ets for a cigarette. He found the 
pack and put it absently on the 
table in front of him without 
lighting one. He said nothing. 

Norvell said apologetically, “It 
wasn’t my fault, Arnie. This rat 
Stimmens — ” He told what had 
happened at the office, conclud- 
ing, “It’s going to be all right, 
Arnie. Don’t worry about me. 
It’s like you said — maybe I 





should have canceled long ago. 
I’ll make a fresh start in Belly 
Rave. Virginia can help me; she 
knows her way around there. 
We’ll find some place that isn’t 
too bad, you know, and get it 
fixed up. Some of those old hous- 
es are pretty interesting. And it’s 
only a question of time until — ” 
“I see. You’ve taken an im- 
portant step, Norvell. Naturally, 
I wish you the best of luck.” 
“Thanks, Arnie,” Norvell said 
eagerly. “I don’t think it’ll be so 
bad. I—” 

“Of course,” Arnie went on 
meditatively, “it does put me in 
kind of a spot.” 

“You, Arnie?” Norvell cried, 
aghast. 

r|WORCAS shrugged. “It 
doesn’t matter, I suppose. 
It’s just that the fellows at the 
shop warned me that you were 
probably stringing me along 
about the tickets. I don’t know 
what I’ll tell them that won’t 
make you look pretty bad, Nor- 
vell.” 

Norvell squeezed his eyes shut. 
Loyal Arnie! Concerned about 
his status in the eyes of the other 
engineers! 

“Well, that’s the way the ball 
bounces, Norvell,” Arnie went 
on. “I can’t blame you for put- 
ting your own problems first.” 
He looked ostentatiously at his 
watch. “I’d better be getting back 

49 



to the Hall. My brother has 
something he wants to consult 
with me about.’-^ He dropped a 
bill on the table and piloted 
Norvell to the door. 

Under the dingy marquee, he 
patted Norvell’s shoulder. “Drop 
me a line once in a while, won’t 
you?” he urged. “I’m the world’s 
worst letter-writer, but I’ll al- 
ways be glad to hear how you’re 
getting along.” 

Norvell stopped. “Write you a 
letter, Arnie? I’ll be seeing you, 
won’t J?” 

“Of course you will.” Dwor- 
cas frowned at the rain. He said 
patiently, “It’s just that you 
naturally won’t want to make 
that trip from Belly Rave too 
often. For that matter. I’ll be 
kind of tied up evenings myself 
until I get this thing for my 
brother over with . Look, Nor- 
vell, no sense standing here. 
Drop me a line when you get a 
chance. And the best of luck, 
fellow!” 

Norvell nodded blankly and 
walked into the rain. With his 
credit card canceled and no cash- 
money in his pockets, it was a 
long, wet way home. After the 
second block, he thought of go- 
ing back and borrowing cab fare 
from Arnie. 

He decided not to. 

He needed plenty of time to 
rehearse what he was going to 
say to Virginia. 

50 



Tj^ORTUNATELY, Virginia’s 
daughter was asleep. Norvell 
changed his sopping clothes with- 
out a word to his wife, came 
down, looked her in the eye and 
told her — directly and brutally. 

Then he waited for the ex- 
plosion. Virginia sat there, blank- 
faced, and ran her fingers caress- 
ingly over the soft arms of the 
chair. She rose and wandered to 
the wall patterner. Typical of 
her sloppy housework, the morn- 
ing-cheer pattern was still on. 
With gentle fingers, she reset the 
wall to a glowing old rose and 
dimmed the lights to a roman- 
tic, intimate amber. She drifted 
to a wall and mirrorized it, look- 
ing long at herself. 

Norvell looked, too. Under 
the flattering lights, her skin was 
gold-touched and flawless, the 
harsh scowl lines magicked away. 

She sat on the warm, textured 
floor and began to sob. 

Norvell found himself squat- 
ting awkwardly beside her. 
“Please, honey. Please don’t cry.” 

She didn’t stop. But she didn’t 
push him away. He was cradling 
her uncomfortably in his arms, 
talking to her in a way he had 
never been able to before. Being 
without contract status would 
be hard, of course, but weren’t 
thousands of people standing it 
right now? Maybe things had 
been physically too easy for 
them, maybe it took pressure to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



weld two jjersonalities together, 
maybe their marriage would turn 
into shared toil and shared hap- 
piness and . 

Alexandra giggled from the 
head of the stairs. 

Norvell sat straight up. The 
girl tittered, “Well, excuse me! 
I didn’t dream there was any- 
thing intimate going on.” 
Virginia got quickly to her 
feet. 

He swallowed and made the 
effort. “Sandy,” he said gently, 
using her almost -forgotten pet 
name, “please come down. I have 
something to tell you.” 

Virginia stood tensely. Nor- 
vell knew she was trying and 
loved her for it. 

girl came down the 
stairs, her much too sophis- 
ticated dressing gown fastened 
with a careless pin. 

Norvell began firmly, “San- 
dy — ” 

Alexandra’s face was ancient 
and haughty. “Please,” she in- 
terrupted him. “You know how 
I feel about that humiliating 
nickname.” 

“I didn’t mean — ” 

“Of course you didn’t mean 
anything. You didn’t mean to 
wake me up with your drunken 
performance on the stairs, did 
you? You didn’t mean to keep 
Virginia and me in terror when 
you didn’t bother to let us know 



you’d be out late.” She shot a 
sly glance at her mother, fishing 
for approbation. 

Virginia’s hands were clenched 
in a tight knot. 

Norvell said hopelessly, “L on- 
ly wanted to tell you some- 
thing.” 

“Nothing you can say now 
would help.” 

“No?” Norvell yelled at her, 
restraint gone. “Well, listen any- 
way, damn it! We’re going to 
Belly Rave! All of us — ^tomor- 
row! Doesn’t that mean anything 
to you?” 

Virginia said at last, with a 
wiry edge to her voice, “You 
don’t have to shout at the poor 
child.” 

That was the ball game. He 
knew perfectly well she had 
meant nothing of the kind, but 
his glands answered for him. 
“So I don’t have to shout at her 
— because she isn’t deaf like me, 
is that it? My loyal wife! My 
loving family!” 

’‘I didn’t mean that!” Vir- 
ginia cried. 

“You never do!” Norvell bel- 
lowed over Alexandra’s shrill 
contribution. 

Virginia screamed, “You know 
I didn’t mean it, but I wish I 
had! You call yourself a hus- 
band! You can’t even take care 
of a family!” 

It went on and on almost until 
dawn.

C HARLES M u n d i n said, 
“Thanks for springing Bligh, 
Del.” 

Dworcas answered affably, 
“Hell, any time. Besides, he’s a 
friend of Arnie’s. Now what’s on 
your mind?” 

“G-M-L Homes. Del, I think 
you’ve put me onto something. 
If it works out — ^well, I won’t 
forget.” 

“Sure, Charles. Look, it’s get- 
ting late and I’ve got a couple of 
things to do.” 

“I’ll make it quick. This elec- 
tion, Del — let me out of it, will 
you? I mean I’ll take my licking 
at the polls and all that, but I 
want to get right on this G-M-L 
thing, not spend my time on a 
sound truck or waiting for a 
broadcast that never happens. 
Besides — honestly, Del, I can’t 
afford it. I’m busted.” 

“What’s the matter, Charles? 
The going getting rough?” 
Mundin said stubbornly, “You 
don’t give a damn whether I run 
or not and you know it. I’ve got 
no hard feelings. Just let me off 
the hook.” 

Dworcas made his decision. 
He grinned. “Why should I get in 
your way? Hop on this deal if it 
looks so good. I’m not saying it 
won’t leave me short-handed — 
I’ve even got Arnie helping out, 
though God knows he won’t be 



good for much. So you think this 
G-M-L deal is actually on the 
level?” 

Charles opened his mouth to 
answer, but one of Dworcas’ 
handymen stuck his head in the 
door. 

He whispered to Del. 

Dworcas apologized, “Sorry, 
Charles, but Jimmy Baker is 
here. Excuse me a minute.” 

It really wasn’t much more 
than a minute, even though, 
when Dworcas came back, he 
was walking slowly and he didn’t 
look at Mundin. “What was I 
asking? Oh, yeah — if you think 
the G-M-L deal is actually on 
the level.” 

“Yes, I do. At any rate. I’m 
going to give it a whirl.” 

“Wonder if you’re doing the 
right thing.” 

Mundin was startled. “How do 
you mean?” 

Dworcas shrugged. “It’s a 
pretty serious business, practi- 
cing a kind of law you aren’t 
trained for. It’s your affair, 
though. I just don’t want to see 
you getting into trouble.” 

“Wait a minute! What’s this 
about? It was your idea, wasn’t 
it?” 

Dworcas said coldly, “Wor- 
ried, Mundin? Trying to hang it 
on me?” He picked up his phone 
in a gesture of dismissal. “Take 
off, will you? I’ve got work to 
do.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



¥T bothered Mundin all the way 
home, and it bothered him 
the next morning when he woke 
up. 

It bothered him even more at 
the County Courthouse. He 
walked in with a nod to the duty 
cop and the cop looked right 
through him. He said to the as- 
sistant clerk at the counter, 
“What do you say, Abe? How 
are the kids?” And the clerk 
mumbled something and closed 
his window with a bang. 

By then, Mimdin began to 
catch on. He got sore and he got 
determined. He waited in line at 
the next window and asked for 
the records he wanted. He sent 
back the wrong folder they gave 
him first. He pointed out that 
half the papers were missing 
from the right folder when he got 
it. He sat in the County Clerk’s 
waiting room for two hours, un- 
til the secretary wandered in and 
said, with aggrieved hostility, 
“Mr. Cochrane has gone to 
lunch. He won’t be back today.” 

He wrote out a formal com- 
plaint on the sheet of paper she 
grudgingly gave him, alleging 
that he was being illegally and 
improperly hampered in his at- 
tempt to examine the corporate 
public-records files of G-M-L 
Homes, Inc., and he doggedly 
left it with her, knowing what 
would happen to the paper as 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



soon as he got out of the door. 

It fluttered into the waste- 
basket before he got out of the 
door and he turned angrily to 
object. 

The duty cop was standing 
right beside him, looking eager. 

Mundin went back to his office 
to think things over. 

Fourteen billion dollars . 

T>UT how the devil did they 
know so fast? Not from 
Dworcas, Mundin told himself. 
He could swear that Del hadn’t 
known the heat was on until 
Jimmy Baker had called him out 
of the room. And Dworcas had 
sent Mundin there in the first 
place. Because — Mundin flushed 
angrily at the thought, almost 
certain that it was right — ^be- 
cause Dworcas was pretty sure 
that a two-bit ambulance chaser 
like himself wouldn’t do them 
any good? Then what had 
changed his mind? 

Mundin kicked the Sleepless 
Secretary and went on pacing. 
In bell-like tones, the Secretary 
told him that Mrs. Mundin 
would remit the full balance due 
by Friday. 

He sat down at the desk. All 
right, so the going was going to 
be tough. That figured. What 
else could you expect? And the 
harder G-M-L Homes made it, 
the more scared they were — 

53 



didn’t that figure, too? And the 
more scared they were, the more 
chance that this whole impos- 
sible thing was on the level, 
that Charles Mundin, L1.B., 
stood on the threshold of cor- 
porate law. 

He took out a piece of paper 
and began to figure. They could 
make it rough, but they couldn’t 
stop him. He could get court 
orders to see the records. That 
was the obvious starting place, 
if only to make sure for himself 
that the Lavins were on the level. 
As long as Norma Lavin was 
willing to call him her attorney- 
in-fact, they couldn’t keep him 
out. 

There would be a slowdown 
in court, naturally, but it 
couldn’t take more than a couple 
of days. Meanwhile, he could get 
started on some of the other 
angles. Don’s conditioning — 
there might be a criminal charge 



in that somewhere, if he could 
manage to get names, dates and 
places. 

He reached for his model- 
forms book and began drafting 
a power of attorney for Norma 
Lavin to sign. She’d sign it, of 
course — she was an independent 
and difficult person, but she 
didn’t have much choice. Be- 
sides, he thought absently, a lot 
of that hardness was undoubted- 
ly protective armor. In circum- 
stances like hers, what could you 
expect? 

The phone rang. He cut out 
the Sleepless Secretary hastily 
and picked up the receiver. 
“Mundin,” he said. 

The voice was ancient and 
utterly lost. “This is Harry 
Ryan,” it quavered. “Better 
come out here, Mundin. I think 
they’ve snatched Norma!”

SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



B ut had he heard a voice? 
He couldn’t be sure. Re- 
constructing it a moment 
later, Joe Collins knew he had 
been lying on his bed, too tired 
even to take his waterlogged 
shoes off the blanket. He had 
been staring at the network of 
cracks in the muddy yellow ceil- 
ing, watching water drip slowly 
and mournfully through. 

It must have happened then. 
Collins caught a glimpse of metal 
beside his bed. He sat up. There 
was a machine on the floor, where 



no machine had been. 

In that first moment of sur- 
prise, Collins thought he heard a 
very distant voice say, “There! 
That does it!” 

He couldn’t be sure of the 
voice. But the machine was un- 
deniably there. 

Collins knelt to examine it. The 
machine was about three feet 
square and it was humming soft- 
ly. The crackle-gray surface was 
featureless, except for a red but- 
ton in one corner and a brass 
plate in the center. The plate 



SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 



55 



said, CLASS-A UTILIZER, 
SERIES AA-1256432. And un- 
derneath, WARNING! THIS 
MACHINE SHOULD BE 
USED ONLY BY CLASS-A 
RATINGS! 

That was all. 

rj^HERE were no knobs, dials, 
switches or any of the other 
attachments Collins associated 
with machines. Just the brass 
plate, the red button and the 
hum. 

“Where did you come from?” 
Collins asked. The Class-A Utili- 
zer continued to hum. He hadn’t 
really expected an answer. Sitting 
on the edge of his bed, he stared 
thoughtfully at the Utilizer. The 
question now was — ^what to do 
with it? 

He touched the red button 
warily, aware of his lack of ex- 
perience with machines that fell 
from nowhere. When he turned it 
on, would the floor open up? 
Would little green men drop from 
the ceiling? 

But he had slightly less than 
nothing to lose. He pressed the 
button lightly. 

Nothing happened. 

“All right— do something,” 

Collins said, feeling definitely let 
down. The Utilizer only contin- 
ued to hum softly. 

Well, he could always pawn it. 
Honest Charlie would give him 
at least a dollar for the metal. 



He tried to lift the Utilizer. It 
wouldn’t lift. He tried again, ex- 
erting all his strength, and suc- 
ceeded in raising one comer an 
inch from the floor. He released 
it and sat down on the bed, 
breathing heavily. 

“You should have sent a couple 
of men to help me,” Collins told 
the Utilizer. Immediately, the 
hum grew louder and the ma- 
chine started to vibrate. 

Collins watched, but still noth- 
ing happened. On a hunch, he 
reached out and stabbed the red 
button. 

Immediately, two bulky men 
appeared, dressed in rough work- 
clothes. They looked at the Util- 
izer appraisingly. One of them 
said, “Thank God, it’s the small 
model. The big ones is brutes 
to get a grip on.” 

The other man said, “It beats 
the marble quarry, don’t it?” 
They looked at Collins, who 
stared back. Finally the first man 
said, “Okay, Mac, we ain’t got 
all day. Where you want it?” 
“Who are you?” Collins man- 
aged to croak. 

“The moving men. Do we look 
like the Vanizaggi Sisters?” 
“But where do you come 
from?” Collins asked. “And 
why?" 

“We come from the Powha 
Minnile Movers, Incorporated,” 
the man said. “And we come be- 
cause you wanted movers, that’s 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



why. Now, where you want it?” 
“Go away,” Collins said. “I’ll 
call for you later.” 

The moving men shrugged 
their shoulders and vanished. For 
several minutes, Collins stared at 
the spot where they had been. 
Then he stared at the Class-A 
Utilizer, which was humming 
softly again. 

Utilizer? He could give it a 
better name. 

A Wishing Machine. 

Collins was not particularly 
shocked. When the miraculous 
occurs, only dull, workaday men- 
talities are unable to accept it. 
Collins was certainly not one of 
those. He had an excellent back- 
ground for acceptance. 

■jl/fOST of his life had been 
spent wishing, hoping, pray- 
ing that something marvelous 
would happen to him. In high 
school, he had dreamed of wak- 
ing up some morning with an 
ability to know his homework 
without the tedious necessity of 
studying it. In the army, he had 
wished for some witch or jinn to 
change his orders, putting him 
in charge of the Day Room, in- 
stead of forcing him to do close- 
order drill like everyone else. 

Out of the army, Collins had 
avoided work, for which he was 
psychologically unsuited. He had 
drifted around, hoping that some 
fabulously wealthy person would 



be induced to change his will, 
leaving him Everything. 

He had never really expected 
anything to happen. But he was 
prepared when it did. 

“I’d like a thousand dollars in 
small unmarked bills,” Collins 
said cautiously. When the hum 
grew louder, he pressed the but- 
ton. In front of him appeared a 
large mound of soiled singles, five 
and ten dollar bills. They were 
not crisp, but they certainly were 
money. 

Collins threw a handful in the 
air and watched it settle beauti- 
fully to the floor. He lay on his 
bed and began making plans. 

First, he would get the machine 
out of New York — upstate, per- 
haps — some place where he 
wouldn’t be bothered by nosy 
neighbors. The income tax would 
be tricky on this sort of thing. 
Perhaps, after he got organized, 
he should go to Central America, 
or . 

There was a suspicious noise 
in the room. 

Collins leaped to his feet. A 
hole was opening in the wall, and 
someone was forcing his way 
through. 

“Hey, I didn’t ask you any- 
thing!” Collins told the machine. 

The hole grew larger, and a 
large, red-faced man was half- 
way through, pushing angrily at 
the hole. 

At that moment, Collins re- 



SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 



57 




membered that machines usually 
have owners. Anyone who owned 
a wishing machine wouldn’t take 
kindly to having it gone. He 
would go to any lengths to re- 
cover it. Probably, he wouldn’t 
stop short of — 

“Protect me!’’ Collins shouted 
at the Utilizer, and stabbed the 
red button. 

▲ SMALL, bald man in loud 
pajamas appeared, yawning 
sleepily. “Sanisa Leek, Temporal 
Wall Protection Service,” he said, 
rubbing his eyes. “I’m Leek. 
What can I do for you?” 

“Get him out of here!” Collins 
screamed. The red-faced mart, 
waving his arms wildly, was al- 
most through the hole. 

Leek found a bit of bright 
metal in his pajamas pocket. The 
red-faced man shouted, “Wait! 
You don’t understand! That 
man — ” 

Leek pointed his piece of met- 
al. The red-faced man screamed 
and vanished. In another moment 
the hole had vanished too. 

“Did you kill him?” Collins 
asked. 

“Of course not,” Leek said, 
putting away the bit of metal. “I 
just veered him back through his 
glommatch. He won’t try that 
way again.” 

“You mean he’ll try some 
other way?” Collins asked. 

“It’s possible,” Leek said. “He 



could attempt a micro-transfer, 
or even an animation.” He look- 
ed sharply at Collins. “This is 
your Utilizer, isn’t" it?” 



58 



GALAXY SCIE.NCE FICTION 




“Of course,” Collins said, start- 
ing to perspire. 

“And you’re an A-rating?” 
“Naturally,” Collins told him. 



“If I wasn’t, what would I be 
doing with a Utilizer?” 

“No offense,” Leek said drow- 
sily, “just being friendly.” He 



SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 



59 



shook his head slowly. “How 
you As get around! I suppose 
you’ve come back here to do a 
history book?” 

Collins just smiled enigmati- 
cally. 

“I’ll be on my way,” Leek 
said, yawning copiously. “On the 
go, night and day. I’d be better 
off in a quarry.” 

And he vanished in the middle 
of a yawn. 

Rain was still beating against 
the ceiling. Across the airshaft, 
the snoring continued, undisturb- 
ed. Collins was alone again, with 
the machine. 

And with a thousand dollars in 
small bills scattered around the 
floor. 

He patted the Utilizer affec- 
tionately. Those A-ratings had it 
pretty good. Want something? 
Just ask for it and press a button. 
Undoubtedly, the real owner 
missed it. 

Leek had said that the man 
might try to get in some other 
way. What way? 

What did it matter? Collins 
gathered up the bills, whistling 
softly. As long as he had the wish- 
ing machine, he could take care 
of himself. 

rw^HE next few days marked a 
great change in Collins’ for- 
tunes. With the aid of the Powha 
Minnile Movers he took the Uti- 
lizer to upstate New York. There, 



he bought a medium-sized moun- 
tain in a neglected corner of the 
Adirondacks. Once the papers 
were in his hands, he walked to 
the center of his property, several 
miles from the highway. The two 
movers, sweating profusely, lug- 
ged the Utilizer behind him, 
cursing monotonously as they 
broke through the dense under- 
brush. 

“Set it down here and scram,” 
Collins said. The last few days 
had done a lot for his confidence. 

The moving men sighed weari- 
ly and vanished. Collins looked 
around. On all sides, as far as he 
could see, was closely spaced 
forest of birch and pine. The air 
was sweet and damp. Birds were 
chirping merrily in the treetops, 
and an occasional squirrel darted 
by. 

Nature! He had always loved 
nature. This would be the perfect 
spot to build a large, impressive 
house with swimming pool, tennis 
courts and, possibly, a small air- 
port. 

“I want a house,” Collins stated 
firmly, and pushed the red but- 
ton. 

A man in a neat gray business 
suit and pince-nez appeared. 
“Yes, sir,” he said, squinting at 
the trees, “but you really must 
be more specific. Do you want 
something classic, like a bunga- 
low, ranch, split-level, mansion, 
castle or palace? Or primitive, 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



like an igloo or hut? Since you are 
an A, you could have something 
up-to-the-minute, like a semi- 
face, an Extended New or a 
Sunken Miniature.” 

“Huh?” Collins said. “I don’t 
know. What would you suggest?” 

“Small mansion,” the man said 
promptly. “They usually start 
with that.” 

“They do?” 

“Oh, yes. Later, they move to 
a warm climate and build a pal- 
ace. 

Collins wanted to ask more 
questions, but he decided against 
it. Everything was going smooth- 
ly. These people thought he was 
an A, and the true owner of the 
Utilizer. There was no sense in 
disenchanting them. 

“You take care of it all,” he 
told the man. 

“Yes, sir,” the man said. “I 
usually do.” 

The rest of the day, Collins re- 
clined on a couch and drank iced 
beverages while the Maxima 
Olph Construction Company ma- 
terialized equipment and put up 
his house. 

It was a low-slung affair of 
some twenty rooms, which Col- 
lins considered quite modest un- 
der the circumstances. It was 
built only of the best materials, 
from a design of Mig of Degma, 
interior by Towige, a Mula swim- 
ming pool and formal gardens by 
Vierien. 



By evening, it was completed, 
and the small army of workmen 
packed up their equipment and 
vanished. 

ROLLINS allowed his chef to 
^ prepare a light supper for 
him. Afterward, he sat in his 
large, cool living room to think 
the whole thing over. In front of 
him, humming gently, sat the 
Utilizer. 

Collins lighted a cheroot and 
sniffed the aroma. First of all, he 
rejected any supernatural explan- 
ations. There were no demons or 
devils involved in this. His house 
had been built by ordinary hu- 
man beings, who swore and 
laughed and cursed like human 
beings. The Utilizer was simply 
a scientific gadget, which worked 
on principles he didn’t under- 
stand or care to understand. 

Could it have come from an- 
other planet? Not likely. They 
wouldn’t have learned English 
just for him. 

The Utilizer must have come 
from the Earth’s future. But 
how? 

Collins leaned back and puffed 
his cheroot. Accidents will hap- 
pen, he reminded himself. Why 
couldn’t the Utilizer have just 
slipped into the past? After all, 
it could create something from 
nothing, and that was much more 
complicated. 

What a wonderful future it 



SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 



61 



must be, he thought. Wishing ma- 
chines! How marvelously civil- 
ized! All a person had to do was 
think of something. Presto! There 
it was. In time, perhaps, they’d 
eliminate the red button. Then 
there’d be no manual labor in- 
volved. 

Of course, he’d have to watch 
his step. There was still the own- 
er — and the rest of the As. They 
would try to take the machine 
from him. Probably, they were 
a hereditary clique . 

A movement caught the edge 
of his eye and he looked up. The 
Utilizer was quivering like a leaf 
in a gale. 

Collins walked up to it, frown- 
ing blackly. A faint mist of steam 
surrounded the trembling Utili- 
zer. It seemed to be overheating. 

Could he have overworked it? 
Perhaps a bucket of water . 

Then he noticed that the Utili- 
zer was perceptibly smaller. It 
was no more than two feet square 
and shrinking before his eyes. 

The owner! Or perhaps the 
As! This must be the micro- 
transfer that Leek had talked 
about. If he didn’t do something 
quickly, Collins knew, his wish- 
ing machine would dwindle to 
nothingness and disappear. 

“Leek Protection Service,” Col- 
lins snapped. He punched the 
button and withdrew his hand 
quickly. The machine was very 
hot. 



Leek appeared in a corner of 
the room, wearing slacks and a 
sports shirt, and carrying a golf 
club. “Must I be disturbed every 
time I — ” 

“Do something!” Collins shout- 
ed, pointing to the Utilizer, which 
was now only a foot square and 
glowing a dull red. 

“Nothing I can do,” Leek said. 
“Temporal wall is all I’m licensed 
for. You want the microcontrol 
people.” He hefted his golf club 
and was gone. 

“IVIICROCONTROL’” Collins 
-L” said, and reached for the 
button. He withdrew his hand 
hastily. The Utilizer was only 
about four inches on a side now 
and glowing a hot cherry red. He 
could barely see the button, 
which was the size of a pin. 

Collins whirled around, grab- 
bed a cushion and punched down. 

A girl with horn-rimmed glass- 
es appeared, notebook in hand, 
pencil poised. “With whom did 
you wish to make an appoint- 
ment?” she asked sedately. 

“Get me help fast!” Collins 
roared, watching his precious 
Utilizer grow smaller and smaller. 

“Mr. Vergon is out to lunch,” 
the girl said, biting her pencil 
thoughtfully. “He’s de-zoned 
himself. I can’t reach him.” 

“Who can you reach?” 

She consulted her notebook. 
“Mr. Vis is in the Dieg Continu- 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



um and Mr. Elgis is doing field 
work in Paleolithic Europe. If 
you’re really in a rush, maybe 
you’d better call Transferpoint 
Control. They’re a smaller out- 
fit, but — ” 

“Transferpoint Control. Okay 
— scram.’’ He turned his full at- 
tention to the Utilizer and stab- 
bed down on it with the scorched 
pillow. Nothing happened. The 
Utilizer was barely half an inch 
square, and Collins realized that 
the cushion hadn’t been able to 
depress the almost invisible but- 
ton. 

For a moment Collins consid- 
ered letting the Utilizer go. May- 
be this was the time. He could 
sell the house, the furnishings, 
and still be pretty well off . 

No! He hadn’t wished for any- 
thing important yet! No one was 
going to take it from him without 
a struggle. 

He forced himself to keep his 
eyes open as he stabbed the 
white-hot button with a rigid 
forefinger. 

A thin, shabbily dressed old 
man appeared, holding something 
that looked like a gaily colored 
Easter egg. He threw it down. 
The egg burst and an orange 
smoke billowed out and was 
sucked directly into the infinites- 
imal Utilizer. A great billow of 
smoke went up, almost choking 
Collins. Then the Utilizer’s shape 
started to form again. Soon, it 



was normal size and apparently 
undamaged. The old man nodded 
curtly. 

“We’re not fancy,” he said, 
“but we’re reliable.” He nodded 
again and disappeared. 

Collins thought he could hear 
a distant shout of anger. 

Shakily, he sat down on the 
floor in front of the machine. His 
hand was throbbing painfully. 

“Fix me up,” he muttered 
through dry lips, and punched 
the button with his good hand. 

The Utilizer hummed louder 
for a moment, then was silent. 
The pain left his scorched finger 
and, looking down, Collins saw 
that there was no sign of a burn 
— not even scar tissue to mark 
where it had been. 

Collins poured himself a long 
shot of brandy and went directly 
to bed. That night, he dreamed he 
was being chased by a gigantic 
letter A, but he didn’t remember 
it in the morning. 

W ITHIN a week, Collins 
found that building his 
mansion in the woods had been 
precisely the wrong thing to do. 
He had to hire a platoon of 
guards to keep away sightseers, 
and hunters insisted on camping 
in his formal gardens. 

Also, the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue began to take a lively 
interest in his affairs. 

But, above all, Collins discov- 



SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 



63 



ered he wasn’t so fond of Nature 
after all. Birds and squirrels were 
all very well, but they hardly 
ranked as conversationalists. 
Trees, though quite ornamental, 
made poor drinking companions. 

Collins decided he was a city 
boy at heart. 

Therefore, with the aid of the 
Powha Minnile Movers, the 
Maxima Alph Construction 
Corporation, the Jagton Instan- 
taneous Travel Bureau and a 
great deal of money placed in 
the proper hands, Collins moved 
to a small Central American re- 
public. There, since the climate 
was warmer and Income Tax 
non-existent, he built a large, 
airy, ostentatious palace. 

It came equipped with the 
usual accessories — horses, dogs, 
peacocks, servants, maintenance 
men, guards, musicians, bevies of 
dancing girls and everything else 
a palace should have. Collins 
spent two weeks just exploring 
the place. 

Everything went along nicely 
for a while. 

One morning Collins ap- 
proached the Utilizer, with the 
vague intention of asking for a 
sports-car, or possibly a small 
herd of pedigreed cattle. He bent 
over the gray machine, reached 
for the red button . 

And the Utilizer backed away 
from him. 

For a moment, Collins thought 



he was seeing things, and he al- 
most decided to stop drinking 
champagne before breakfast. He 
took a step forward and reached 
for the red button. 

The Utilizer sidestepped him 
neatly and trotted out of the 
room. 

C OLLINS sprinted after it, 
cursing the owner and the 
As. This was probably the ani- 
mation that Leek had spoken 
about — somehow, the owner had 
managed to imbue the machine 
with mobility. It didn’t matter. 
All he had to do was catch up, 
punch the button and ask for the 
Animation Control people. 

The Utilizer raced down a hall, 
Collins close behind. An under- 
butler, polishing a solid gold 
doorknob, stared open-mouthed. 
. “Stop it!’’ Collins shouted. 

The under-butler moved clum- 
sily into the Utilizer’s path. The 
machine dodged him gracefully 
and sprinted toward the main 
door. 

Collins pushed a switch and 
the door slammed shut. 

The Utilizer gathered momen- 
tum and went right through it. 
Once in the open, it tripped over 
a garden hose, regained its bal- 
ance and headed toward the open 
countryside. 

Collins raced after it. If he 
could get just a little closer . 
The Utilizer suddenly leaped 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



into the air. It hung there for a 
long moment, then fell to the 
ground. Collins sprang at the 
button. 

The Utilizer rolled out of his 
way, took a short run and leaped 
again. For a moment, it hung 
twenty feet above his head — 
drifted a few feet straight up, 
stopped, twisted wildly and fell. 

Collins was afraid that, on a 
third jump, it would keep going 
up. When it drifted unwillingly 
back to the ground, he was 
ready. He feinted, then stabbed 
at the button. The Utilizer 
couldn’t duck fast enough. 

“Animation Control!’’ Collins 
roared triumphantly. 

There was a small explosion, 
and the Utilizer settled down 
docilely. There was no hint of 
animation left in it. 

Collins wiped his forehead and 
sat on the machine. Closer and 
closer. He’d better do some big 
wishing now, while he still had 
the chance. 

In rapid succession, he asked 
for five million dollars, three 
fuctioning oil wells, a motion- 
picture studio, perfect health, 
twenty-five more dancing girls, 
immortality, a sports-car and a 
herd of pedigreed cattle. 

He thought he heard someone 
snicker. He looked around. No 
one was there. 

When he turned back, the Util- 
izer had vanished. 



He just stared. And, in another 
moment, he vanished. 

■^F^HEN he opened his eyes, 
^ Collins found himself 
standing in front of a desk. On 
the other side was the large, red- 
faced man who had originally 
tried to break into his room 
The man didn’t appear angry. 
Rather, he appeared resigned, 
even melancholy. 

Collins stood for a moment in 
silence, sorry that the whole 
thing was over. The owner . and 
the As had finally caught him. 
But it had been glorious while 
it lasted. 

“Well,” Collins said directly, 
“you’ve got your machine back. 
Now, what else do you want?” 

“My machine?” the red-faced 
man said, looking up incredu- 
lously. “It’s not my machine, sir. 
Not at all.” 

Collins stared at him. “Don’t 
try to kid me, mister. You A- 
ratings want to protect your 
monopoly, don’t you?” 

The red-faced man put down 
his paper. “Mr. Collins,” he said 
stiffly, “my name is Flign. I am 
an agent for the Citizens Pro- 
tective Union, a non-profit or- 
ganization, whose aim is to pro- 
tect individuals such as yourself 
from errors of judgment.” 

“You mean you’re not one of 
the As?” 

“You are laboring under a 



SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 



65 



misapprehension, sir,” Flign said 
with quiet dignity. “The A-rating 
does not represent a social group, 
as you seem to believe. It is 
merely a credit rating.” 

“A what?” Collins asked slow- 
ly- 

“A credit rating.” Flign 
glanced at his watch. “We have- 
n’t much time, so I’ll make this 
as brief as possible. Ours is a 
decentralized age, Mr. Collins. 
Our businesses, industries and 
services are scattered through an 
appreciable portion of space and 
time. The utilization corporation 
is an essential link. It provides 
for the transfer of goods and serv- 
ices from point to point. Do you 
understand?” 

Collins nodded. 

“Credit is, of course, an auto- 
matic privilege. But, eventually, 
everything must be paid for.” 
Collins didn’t like the sound 
of that. Pay? This place wasn’t 
as civilized as he had thought. 
No one had mentioned paying. 
Why did they bring it up now? 

“Why didn’t someone stop 
me?” he asked desperately. 
“They must have known# I didn’t 
have a proper rating.” 

Flign shook his head. “The 
credit ratings are suggestions, not 
laws. In a civilized world, an in- 
dividual has the right to his own 
decisions. I’m very sorry, sir.” 
He glanced at his watch again 
and handed Collins the paper he 



had been reading. “Would you 
just glance at this bill and tell 
me whether it’s in order?” 

Collins took the paper and 
read : 

One Palace, with 

Accessories Cr. 450,000,000 

Services of Maxima 

Olph Movers 111,000 

122 Dancing Girls 122,000,000 

Perfect Health 888,234,031 

He scanned the rest of the list 
quickly. The total came to slight- 
ly better than eighteen billion 
Credits. 

“Wait a minute!” Collins 
shouted. “I can’t be held to this! 
The Utilizer just dropped into 
my room by accident!” 

“That’s the very fact I’m going 
to bring to their attention,” Flign 
said. “Who knows? Perhaps they 
will be reasonable. It does no 
harm to try.” 

Collins felt the room sway. 
Flign’s face began to melt before 
him. 

“Time’s up,” Flign said. “Good 
luck.” 

Collins closed his eyes. 

W HEN he opened them again, 
he was standing on a bleak 
plain, facing a range of stubby 
mountains. A cold wind lashed 
his face and the sky was the color 
of steel. 

A raggedly dressed man was 
standing beside him. “Here,” the 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



man said and handed Collins a 
pick. 

“What’s this?” 

“This is a pick,” the man said 
patiently. “And over there is a 
quarry, where you and I and a 
number of others will cut mar- 
ble.” 

“Marble?” 

“Sure. There’s always some 
idiot who wants a palace,” the 
man said with a wry grin. “You 
can call me Jang. We’ll be to- 
gether for some time.” 

Collins blinked stupidly. “How 
long?” 

“You work it out,” Jang said. 
“The rate is fifty credits a month 
until your debt is paid off.” 

The pick dropped from Col- 
lins’ hand. They couldn’t do this 
to him! The Utilization Corpora- 
tion must realize its mistake by 
now! They had been at fault, 
letting the machine slip into the 
past. Didn’t they realize that? 

“It’s all a mistake!” Collins 
said. 

“No mistake,” Jang said. 
“They’re very short of labor. 
Have to go recruiting all over for 
it. Come on. After the first thou- 
sand years you won’t mind it.” 

Collins started to follow Jang 
toward the quarry. He stopped. 

“The first thousand years? I 
won’t live that long!” 

“Sure you will,” Jang assured 
him. “You got immortality, 
didn’t you?” 



Yes, he had. He had wished 
for it, just before they took back 
the machine. Or had they taken 
back the machine after he wished 
for it? 

Collins remembered some- 
thing. Strange, but he didn’t re- 
member seeing immortality on 
the bill Flign had showed him. 

“How much did they charge 
me for immortality?” he asked. 

Jang looked at him and laugh- 
ed. “Don’t be naive, pal. You 
should have it figured out by 
now.” 

He led Collins toward the 
quarry. “Naturally, they give 
that away for nothing.”

My dearest Anne, 

Please forgive the delay in re- 
plying to your letters and cable. 
The truth is that I was quite un- 
able to write, anxious as I was to 
do so. It’s a rather long story, but 
I would like to explain just how 
this came to be and so prove how 
unfounded your suspicions were. 

You see, shortly after I arrived 
here, I ran into a Professor 
Phelps - Smythe Burdinghaugh, 
lately of England. Professor Bur- 



dinghaugh has been forced to re- 
sign from several universities in 
England because of the rather 
free manner in which he con- 
ducted his experiments. He ad- 
mitted that no less than 16 
physics laboratories have been de- 
molished through his own mis- 
calculations. 

At any rate, finding the atmos- 
phere in our country somewhat 
cool toward his continued re- 
searches, he came to New York, 
which, as you know, is inhabited 
wholly by wealthy eccentrics, 
tourists and boors. Such an en- 
vironment was eminently suited 
to the Professor’s needs and he 
settled here to work on an anti- 
gravity belt, his lifelong project. 

You may wonder, reasonably 
enough, what Professor Burding- 
haugh has to do with the delay in 
writing to you, but I assure you 
that, were it not for him, you 
would have heard from me much 
sooner. Much sooner indeed. 

It all began with a Scotch-and- 
water. The Professor and I were 
each having one and inevitably 
we struck up a conversation. We 
chatted on a great number of top- 
ics and I remember that he was 
quite impressed when I told him 
you were indeed the Chemicals 
Anne Harrodsbury. Not long 
after this, the old boy (he is fifty- 
ish and rather heavy) invited me 
in the flush of good comradeship 
(and good Scotch) to take part in

his latest experiment with his 
anti-gravity unit. Feeling rather 
light-headed, I heartily acclaimed 
his suggestion and we repaired to 
his laboratory. 

“My boy,” he said to me later, 
as he strapped a bulky belt 
around my waist. “My boy, you 
are about to witness a milestone 
in history. Most assuredly, a 
milestone.” 

I nodded, basking in the old 
boy’s magnificent confidence. 

“We are about to enter a new 
era,” he continued. “The Era of 
Space!” 

His voice dropped to a low, 
comradely whisper. “And I have 
chosen you, my boy, to assist me 
in forging this trail to new suns, 
new worlds, new civilizations! 
The whole Galaxy lies before us!” 

I could see only Professor Bur- 
dinghaugh’s massive girth before 
me, but I assumed he could see 
things much more clearly than I. 

The Professor filled our glasses 
from the bottle I had bought, 
then put his face close to mine. 
“Do you know why no one has 
ever invented an anti-gravity 
belt?” he confided. “I’ll tell you — 
it takes research, and research 
takes money. And money is very 
hard to get. Especially,” he add- 
ed, gazing somberly at his high- 
ball, “in my field of research.” 

He shrugged, then busied him- 
self with some adjustments on the 
belt he had wrapped around me. 



“There,” he said finally, stepping 
back, “it’s ready.” We went out- 
side to the garden behind his 
laboratory. 

“All my life,” he mused, “I’ve 
wanted to be the first to defy 
gravity, but — ” here a suspicious 
wetness glistened in his eyes — 
“my fondness for good food and 
good drink has paid its price. I 
am far too heavy for the belt. 
That’s why I am giving you this 
chance to roar to fame. You — you 
will have the glory, while I . .” 
He choked, then quickly drained 
his glass. 

“Enough! The stars are wait- 
ing! The experiment must begin!” 
He paused to refill his glass from 
the bottle he had brought out 
with him. 

“When I say, ‘Go!’ push this 
button on the belt,” he explained. 
“Ready?” 

I nodded. 

“A toast first!” he cried. Sober- 
ly, he gazed at his glass. “To 
Man,” he pronounced moment- 
ously, “and the Stars.” He took a 
sizable swallow, then fixed me 
with a feverish glare. 

“Go.'” 

I confess that never, before or 
since, have I felt such a strange 
sensation as when I pushed the 
button on the belt. Suddenly, I 
felt like a leaf, or a feather, float- 
ing on a soft warm curl of cloud. 
It was as if all the troubles, all 
the cares of the world had been

miraculously lifted from my 
shoulders. A glow of well-being 
seemed to pulse through my 
whole body. 

The sound of Professor Bur- 
dinghaugh’s voice brought an 
abrupt end to this strange light- 
ness of mind. The Professor was 
pointing at me with an intensity 
I rarely before have seen, mutter- 
ing, “It works — it worksV’ He 
seemed rather amazed. 

I looked down and, with a feel- 
ing I can only describe as giddi- 
ness, saw that indeed it was 
working. I was rising slowly from 
the ground and was then about 
a foot in the air. 

At this historical juncture, we 
looked at each other for a mo- 
ment, then began to laugh as 
success rushed to our heads. The 
Professor even did a mad little 
jig while, for my part, I gyrated 
in the air unrestrained. 

It was not until I was about ten 
feet off the ground that I began 
to feel uneasy. I was never one 
to stomach high altitudes, you 
might recall, and the sight of ten 
feet of emptiness beneath me was 
disquieting. 

“Professor,” I asked hesitantly, 
“how do I turn off the belt?” 

Burdinghaugh’s glass stopped 
an inch from his lips. “Turn it 
off?” he countered thickly. 

“Yes!” I shouted, now fifteen 
feet in the air. “How do I turn 
it off? How do I get down?” 



The Professor gazed up at me 
thoughtfully. “My boy,” he said 
at last, “I never thought about 
getting down — been much too 
concerned with getting jolly well 
up.” 

“Burdinghaugh!" I screamed. 
“Get me down\” I was now 
twenty feet above the ground. 

“I’m sorry, old boy, dread- 
fully sorry,” he called to me. “I 
can’t. But don’t think your life 
will have been spent in vain. In- 
deed not! I’ll see to it that you 
get proper credit as my assistant 
when the anti-gravity belt is 
perfected. You’ve been invalu- 
able, dear boy, invaluable!” His 
voice faded. 

“Professor!” I screamed futile- 
ly, but by then we were too far 
apart to make ourselves heard 
and, even as I wasted my breath, 
a gust of wind caught me and 
sent me soaring into the air, spin- 
ning like a top. But, just before 
I entered a cloud, I saw the Pro- 
fessor standing far below, his feet 
planted wide apart, his head 
thrown back while he watched 
my progress. I fancied that, as I 
disappeared into the mist, he 
waved a solemn good-by and 
drank my health. 

You can’t imagine the torture I 
went through as I sailed through 
the air. During those first few mo- 
ments, I had felt light, carefree, 
buoyant. But, in these higher alti- 
tudes, I was buffeted by strong 



HIGH MAN

winds, pelted by rain in enormous 
quantities and subjected to sud- 
den drops that had me gasping. 
How I managed to survive, I can’t 
understand. Surely, I would have 
died if I had floated completely 
out of the atmosphere but, luck- 
ily, the belt’s power to lift me 
leveled off at about 10,000 feet. 

For days, I drifted at that 
altitude, blown willy-nilly by the 
contrary winds, starved and bit- 
terly cold. Several times, I tried 
to steer myself — but to no avail. 
I was powerless to control my 
flight. My sense of direction left 
me and I had no idea where I 
was. Sometimes, I would look 
down through a rift in the clouds 
and see farmland, or perhaps 
cities. Once I glimpsed the sea — 
and shut my eyes. 

It was not until the sixth day 
of my flight that I noticed a 
change. I was sinking. Slowly but 
steadily, I was losing altitude. 
I was at a loss to explain this 
phenomenon at first, but then I 
remembered that the Professor 
had said the belt was powered by 
batteries. Obviously, the batteries 
were weakening. 

A few hours later, I landed 
gently, only a few blocks from 
where I had started my unwilling 
flight. During those six frightful 
days, I must have been blown 
around in circles. Weak, starved, 
shaken, sick, I was taken to a hos- 
pital, from which I have just been 



released. Needless to say, I imme- 
diately tried to locate Professor 
Burdinghaugh, but have been un- 
able to find a trace of him. You 
might say he has disappeared 
into thin air. 

You must be wondering, of 
course, what this singular ad- 
venture has to do with my not 
writing you earlier. However, I 
feel certain you understand now 
that writing was impossible under 
the circumstances. 

All the ink in my fountain pen 
leaked out when I reached the 
altitude of 10,000 feet — I have the 
kind of pen that writes under 
water — and I had to put my pen- 
cil between my teeth to keep 
them from chattering and knock- 
ing out my inlays. During my 
stay at the hospital, of course, I 
couldn’t write, as I was too weak 
even to flirt with the nurses — 
which, as you know, is very weak 
indeed. 

So, please forgive my unfortun- 
ate lapse in correspondence. Tru- 
ly, I would have written, had it 
been possible. 

Devotedly, 

Roger 

P.S. I resent your implication 
that I am engaged to you only 
because of your money. The fact 
that you are extremely wealthy

for you. I’m particularly hurt by 
your suspicion that I’d spend 
your money on other women. 
Really, I’m shocked that such a 
thing could even occur to you. 
And, now that you know why I 
haven’t written before, I trust 
you’ll restore my draw on your 
account at the bank. My funds 
are rather low. 

Roger 

London, W. 1 
May 1 

Dear Roger, 

I always sensed you were a 
despicable, smooth-talking gold- 
digger — but I didn’t really con- 
vince myself of it until I read 
your letter. Do you really expect 
me to believe that story? An anti- 
gravity belt! What do you take 
me for — one of your silly impres- 
sionable American women? 

Besides, I happen to have met 
your Professor Phelps-Smythe 
Burdinghaugh in London, only a 
few days ago, and he assured me 
that, while he had met you in 
New York, it was under very dif- 
ferent circumstances from those 
you described. He said you were 
with two women and that all 
three of you were quite drunk. He 
also said he had never invented 
an anti-gravity belt and seemed 
rather amused at the idea. 

Needless to say, he was sur- 
prised to learn that I was your 
fiancee. He was under the impres- 



sion that you were engaged to 
some American girl, he said, but 
he couldn’t tell which one. That 
was the last straw. 

This is the end, Roger. Our 
engagement is broken. I bear you 
no ill will — indeed. I’m glad it’s 
all over. The one thing I’m furi- 
ous about is the way you ma- 
ligned the Professor, trying to 
make me think he was responsible 
for your not writing. How per- 
fectly ridiculous! 

Really, Roger, you would do 
well to model yourself after the 
Professor. He is so charming, so 
cultured, so thoughtful! I’ll never 
forgive you for trying to blame 
him for your own shortcomings. 

Anne 

P.S. For obvious reasons, I shan’t 
restore your draw on my account 
at the bank. And that’s another 
thing. I thought you were awfully 
vague about what “business” you 
had in New York, and now I 
know. The Professor said you 
told him you were on vacation. 
Business trip indeed! Cad! 

Anne 

London, W. 1 
May 3 

My dear boy. 

Ever since I watched you dis- 
appear into that cloud, I have 
been trying to think of some way 
to make up to you the beastly 
suffering you must have experi- 
enced at my behest. At long last. 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I have discovered a way. 

Immediately after the experi- 
ment, I found it necessary to re- 
turn to London. While there, 
seeking funds to continue my re- 
searches, I happened to meet 
your fiancee. It was at this mo- 
ment that I conceived the plan 
for which I know you will be 
eternally thankful. 

I had been troubled by the fact 
that the world was being de- 
prived of your obvious natural 
brilliance in applied science — ^who 
else would have thought of need- 
ing a button to turn off the anti- 
gravity belt? — because of your 
ties to more material things. 
Namely, your fiancee. I therefore 
resolved to free you from your 
bonds — and hers — and give the 
world the benefit of your genius. 

Carrying out this plan was no 
easy task, however, and I am sure 
you will appreciate the problems 
involved. I first had to convince 
Anne that your story was pure 
rot, or else she would have hung 
on to you like a leech for the 
rest of your life. This I did by 
denying all particulars of your 
story — or, rather, by telling the 
truth about your activities in 
New York — and adding a few 
embellishments of my own. 

Of course, this was only tem- 
porary relief. I knew something 
more permanent had to be done 
to keep her from ruining your 
bright future. It was clear there 



was only one solution — I had to 
woo her myself. I may add that 
she has found me not unattrac- 
tive and so I have every reason to 
believe we shall be married within 
the fortnight. 

Thus, I have rid you of all en- 
tanglements and freed you to use 
your vast talents to advance the 
cause of science. At the same 
time, if I may return to a more 
materialistic plane, I have pro- 
vided myself with sufficient funds 
to carry on my researches, since 
Anne will gladly supply same. 

But please — do not feel in debt 
to me. I consider it a privilege to 
sacrifice myself to Anne for such 
a glorious cause. Then too, ladies 
of such obvious refinement — and 
means — always have appealed to 
me. 

I hope that in this small way I 
have in part repaid you for your 
invaluable contribution to my 
work. 

Sincerely, 

Phelps-Smythe Burdinghaugh 
P.S. Since, by marrying Anne, I 
shall become your creditor, I sug- 
gest you make arrangements with 
utmost despatch to repay the 
monies you borrowed from her. 
Shall we say thirty days, dear 
boy? 

My researches are quite ex- 
pensive. I do, you know, still 
have a quite genuine fondness for 
good food and drink.

My dear Burdinghaugh, 

You win. Anne is yours, for 
which I am glad. I may have for- 
gotten to tell you that nearly all 
of her funds are in untouchable 
trusts — not in bonds. 

In regard to the monies due 
you, my cheque will be in the 
mails this week. Such trifling 
amounts now mean nothing to 
me. 

As for your methods in usurp- 
ing my relationship with Anne, I 
have only admiration — speaking 
as one professional to another, of 
course. Unfortunately, however, 
in your eagerness to get your 
hands on Anne’s fortune, you 
quite overlooked one very im- 
portant item — the key item, in 
fact — the anti-gravity belt. 



It may be of interest to you 
that I have taken out a patent on 
the belt and am manufacturing 
small units for toy spaceships. 
The “gimmick,” as these Ameri- 
can subjects put it, is “hot” and 
the turnover is fantastic. The toy 
ships rise and rise into the sky 
and never come down and, as 
soon as they disappear, the junior 
rocketmen immediately start 
bawling for another one. It isn’t 
quite the Era of Space, but it’s 
considerably more profitable. 

Pity you hadn’t thought about 
patenting the belt — these Ameri- 
cans are so free with their dol- 
lars. 

But then, you have Anne. 
What could be fairer? 

Gratefully yours, 

Roger

Down Among 

The Dead Men 



By WILLIAM TENN 



I STOOD in front of The 
Junkyard’s outer gate and 
felt my stomach turn over 
slowly, grindingly, the way it had 
when I saw a whole terrestrial 
sub-fleet — close to 20,000 men — 
blown to bits in the Second Battle 
of Saturn, more than eleven years 
ago. But then there had been 
shattered fragments of ships in 
my visiplate and imagined 
screams of men in my mind, 
there had been the expanding 
images of the Eoti’s boxlike craft 
surging through the awful, drift- 
ing wreckage they had created, 
to account for the icy sweat that 
wound itself like a flat serpent 
around my forehead and my 
neck. 

Now there was nothing but a

large, plain building, very much 
like the hundreds of other factor-

Chicago, a manufacturing estab- 
lishment surrounded by a locked 
gate and spacious proving

grounds — The Junkyard. Yet the 
sweat on my skin was colder, the 
heave of my stomach more spas- 
tic than it had ever been in any of 
those countless, ruinous battles 
that had created this place. 

A ll of which was very under- 
standable, I told myself. 
What I was feeling was the great 
grandmother hag of all fears, the 
Ancient of Days, the most basic 
rejection and reluctance of which 
my flesh was capable. It was 
understandable — but that didn’t 
help any. I still couldn’t walk up 
to the sentry at the gate. 

I’d been almost all right until 
I’d seen the huge square can 
against the fence, the can with 
the slight stink coming out of it 
and the big colorful sign on top: 

DON’T WASTE WASTE 
PLACE ALL WASTE HERE 
REMEMBER— 

WHATEVER IS WORN CAN BE SHORN 
WHATEVER IS MAIMED CAN BE 
RECLAIMED 

WHATEVER IS USED CAN BE RE-USED 
PLACE ALL WASTE HERE 

— Conservation Police 

I’d seen those square, compart- 
mented cans and those signs in 
every barracks, every hospital, 
every recreation center, between 
here and the asteroids. But see- 
ing them now, in this place, gave 
them a different meaning. I won- 
dered if they had those other 
posters inside, the shorter ones. 



You know the kind of thing: 

We need all our resources to de- 
feat the enemy — and 

GARBAGE IS OUR BIGGEST 
NATURAL RESOURCE. 

Decorating the walls of this 
building with those posters would 
be downright ingenious. 

Whatever is maimed can be 
reclaimed ... I flexed my right 
arm inside my blue jumper 
sleeve. It felt like a part of me, 
always would feel like a part of 
me. And, in a couple of years, 
assuming that I lived that long, 
the thin white scar that circled 
the elbow joint would be com- 
pletely invisible. Sure — ^whatever 
is maimed can be reclaimed. All 
except one thing — the most im- 
portant thing. 

I now felt less like going in 
than ever. 

And then I saw this kid. The 
one from Arizona Base. 

He was standing right in front 
of the sentry box, paralyzed just 
like me. In the center of his uni- 
form cap was a brand-new, shiny- 
gold Y with a dot in the center — 
the insignia of a slingshot com- 
mander. He hadn’t been wearing 
it the day before at the briefing. 
That could only mean the com- 
mission had just come through. 
He looked real young and real 
scared. 

I remembered him from the 
briefing session. He was the one 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



whose hand had timidly gone up 
during the question period; the 
one who, when he was recognized, 
had half-risen, worked his mouth 
a couple of times and finally 
blurted out, “Excuse me, sir, but 
they don’t — they don’t smell at 
all badly, do they?’’ 

There had been a virtual cy- 
clone of laughter, the yelping 
laughter of men who themselves 
had been close to the torn edge 
of hysteria all afternoon and who 
were damned glad that someone 
had at last said something they 
could make believe was funny. 

And the white-haired briefing 
officer, who hadn’t so much as 
smiled, waited for the hysteria 
to work itself out, before saying 
gravely, “No, they don’t smell 
at all badly. Unless, that is, they 
don’t bathe. The same as with you 
gentlemen.” 

f I ’HAT shut us up. Even the 
kid, blushing his way back in- 
to his seat, set his jaw stiffly at 
that reminder. And it wasn’t un- 
til twenty minutes later, when 
we’d been dismissed, that I began 
to feel the ache in my own face 
from the unrelaxed muscles there. 

“The same as with you gentle- 
men . .” 

I shook myself hard and walk- 
ed over to the kid. “Hello, Com- 
mander,” I said, “been here 
long?” 

He managed a grin. “Over an 



hour. Commander. I caught the 
8:15 out of the Base. Most of the 
other fellows were still sleeping 
off last night’s party. I’d gone to 
bed early — I wanted to give my- 
self as much, time to get the feel 
of this thing as I could. Only — 
it doesn’t seem to have done 
much good.” 

“I know. Some things you can’t 
get used to. Some things you’re 
not supposed to get used to.” 

He looked at my chest. “I guess 
this isn’t your first slingshot com- 
mand?” 

My first? More like my twenty- 
first, son! But then I remember- 
ed that everyone tells me I look 
young for my medals, and what 
the hell, the kid seemed so pale 
under the chin. “No, not exactly 
my first. But I’ve never had a 
blob crew before. This is exactly 
as new to me as it is to you. Hey, 
listen. Commander — I’m having 
a hard time too. What say we 
bust through that gate together? 
Then the worst’ll be over.” 

The kid nodded violently. We 
linked arms and marched up to 
the sentry. We showed him our 
orders. He opened the gate and 
said, “Straight ahead. Any ele- 
vator on your left to the fifteenth 
floor.” 

So, still arm in arm, we walked 
into the main entrance of the 
large building, up a long flight of 
steps and under the sign that said 
in red and black: 



DOWN AMONG THE DEAD 



MEN 



81 



HUMAN PROTOPLASM RECLAMA- 
TION CENTER 

THIRD DISTRICT FINISHING PLANT 

There were some old-looking, 
but very erect, men walking along 
the main lobby and a lot of uni- 
formed, fairly pretty girls. I was 
pleased to note that most of the 
girls were pregnant. The first 
pleasing sight I had hit in almost 
a week. 

We turned into an elevator and 
told the girl, “Fifteen.” She 
punched a button and waited for 
it to fill up. She didn’t seem to 
be pregnant. I wondered what 
was the matter with her. 

I’d almost managed to get a 
good grip on my heaving imagi- 
nation when I got a close look at 
the shouldei patches each of the 
other passengers was wearing. 
That almost did for me right 
there. 

It was a circular red patch with 
the black letters TAF superim- 
posed on a white G-4. TAF 
for Terrestrial Armed Forces, of 
course — ^the letters were the basic 
insignia of all rear echelon out- 
fits. But why didn’t they use G-1, 
which represented the Personnel 
Division? G-4 stood for Supply. 
Supply! 

VTOU can always trust the 
TAF. Thousands of morale 
specialists in all kinds of ranks, 
working their educated heads off 



to keep up the spirits of the men 
in the fighting perimeters — but 
every damned time, the good old 
dependable TAF will pick the 
ugliest name, the one in the worst 
possible taste. 

Oh, sure, I told myself, you 
can’t fight a shattering, no-quar- 
ter interstellar war for twenty- 
five years and keep every pretty 
thought dewy-damp and intact. 
But not Supply, gentlemen. Not 
this place — ^not The Junkyard. 
Let’s at least try to keep up ap- 
pearances. 

Then we began going up, and 
while the elevator girl began an- 
nouncing floors, I had lots of oth- 
er things to think about. 

“Third Floor — Corpse Recep- 
tion and Classification,” the girl 
operator sung out. 

“Fifth Floor — Preliminary Or- 
gan Processing.” 

“Seventh Floor — ^Brain Recon- 
stitution and Neural Alignment.” 

“Ninth Floor — Cosmetics, Ele- 
mentary Reflexes and Muscular 
Control.” 

At this point, I forced myself 
to stop listening, the way you do 
when you’re on a heavy cruiser, 
say, and the rear engine room 
gets flicked by a bolt from an 
Eoti scrambler. After you’ve been 
around when it’s happened a cou- 
ple of times, you learn to kind 
of close your ears and say to 
yourself, “I don’t know anybody 
in that damned engine room, not

anybody, and in a few minutes 
everything will be nice and quiet 
again.” And, in a few minutes, 
it is. Only trouble is that then, 
like as not, you’ll be part of the 
detail that’s ordered into the 
steaming place to scrape the guck 
off the walls and get the jets fir- 
ing again. 

Same way now. Just as soon as 
I had that girl’s voice blocked 
out, there we were on the fifteenth 
floor — “Final Interviews and 
Shipping” — and the kid and I 
had to get out. 

He was real green. A definite 
sag around the knees, shoulders 
sloping forward like his clavicle 
had curled. Again, I was grate- 
ful to him. Nothing like having 
somebody to take care of. 

“Come on. Commander,” I 
whispered. “Up and at ’em. Look 
at it this way — for characters like 
us, this is practically a family 
reunion.” 

It was the wrong thing to say. 
He looked at me as if I’d punch- 
ed his face. “No thanks to you 
for the reminder, mister,” he said. 
Then he walked stiffly up to the 
receptionist. 

I could have bitten off my 
tongue. I hurried after him. “I’m 
sorry, kid,” I told him earnestly. 
“That damned word just slides 
out of my big mouth. But don’t 
get sore at me. Hell, I had to 
listen to myself say it too.” 

He thought about it a mo- 



ment and then nodded. Then he 
gave me a smile. “Okay — no hard 
feelings. It’s a rough war, isn’t 
it?” 

I smiled back. “Rough? Why, 
if you’re not careful, they tell me, 
you can get killed in it.” 

II 

T he receptionist was a soft 
little blonde with two wed- 
ding rings on one hand, and one 
wedding ring on the other. From 
what I knew of current planet- 
side customs, that meant she’d 
been widowed twice. 

She took our orders and read 
jauntily'into her desk mike, “At- 
tention, Final Conditioning. At- 
tention, Final Conditioning. Alert 
for immediate shipment the fol- 
lowing serial numbers — 70623152,

I was impressed. Almost the 
same procedure as when you go 
to Ordnance for a replacement 
set of stern exhaust tubes. 

She looked up and favored us 
with a lovely smile. “Your crews 
will be ready in a moment. Would 
you have a seat, gentlemen?”

After a while, she got up to 
take a folder out of a file cabinet 
set in the wall. As she came back 
to her desk, I noticed she was 
pregnant — only about the third 
or fourth month — and, naturally, 
I gave a little satisfied nod. Out 
of the corner of my eye, I saw 
the kid make the same kind of 
nod. We looked at each other and 
chuckled. “Yeah, it’s a rough, 
rough war,” he said. 

“Where are you from anyway?” 
I asked. “That doesn’t sound like 
a Third District accent to me.” 
“It isn’t. I was born in Scan- 
dinavia — Eleventh Military Dis- 
trict. My home town is Goteborg, 
Sweden. But, after I got my — my 
promotion, naturally I didn’t care 
to see the folks any more. So, I 
requested a transfer to the Third, 
and from now on until I hit a 
scrambler, this is where I’ll be 
spending my furloughs and 
Earthside hospitalizations.” 

I’d heard that a lot of the 
younger slingshotters felt that 
way. Personally, I never had a 
chance to find out how I’d feel 
about visiting the old folks at 
home. My father was knocked 
off in the suicidal attempt to re- 
take Neptune — ’way back when 
I was still in high school, learning 
elementary space combat — and 
my mother was Admiral Raguz- 
zi’s staff secretary when the flag- 
ship Thermopylae took a direct 
hit two years later, in the fa- 



mous defense of Ganymede. That 
was before the Breeding Regu- 
lations, of course, and women 
were still serving in administra- 
tive positions on the fighting pe- 
rimeters. 

O N the other hand, at least two 
of my brothers might still be 
alive. But I’d made no attempt 
to contact them since getting my 
dotted Y. So, I guessed I felt the 
same way as the kid — ^which was 
hardly surprising. 

“Are you from Sweden?” the 
blonde girl was asking. “My sec- 
ond husband was born in Sweden. 
Maybe you knew him — Sven 
Nossen? I understand he had a 
lot of relatives in Oslo.” 

The kid screwed up his eyes as 
if he was thinking real hard. You 
know, running down a list of all 
the Swedes in Oslo. Finally, he 
shook his head. “No, can’t say 
that I do. But I wasn’t out of 
Goteborg very often before I was 
called up.” 

She clucked sympathetically 
at his provincialism — ^the baby- 
faced blonde of classic anecdote. 
A real dumb babe. And yet — 
there were lots of very clever, 
high-pressure cuties around the 
inner planets these days, who had 
to content themselves with a one- 
fifth interest in some abysmal slob 
who boasted the barest modicum 
of maleness, or a certificate from 
the local sperm bank. Blondie

here was on her third full hus- 
band. 

Maybe, I thought, if I were 
looking for a wife myself, this is 
what I’d pick to take the stink 
of scrambler rays out of my nose 
and the yammer-yammer-yam- 
mer of Irvingles out of my ears. 
Maybe I’d want somebody pretty 
and simple to come back to from 
one of those complicated skirm- 
ishes with the Eoti, where you 
spend most of your conscious 
thoughts trying to figure out just 
what battle rhythm the filthy in- 
sects are using this time. Maybe, 
if I were going to get married, 
I’d find a well-stacked fluffhead 
like this more generally desirable 
than — oh, well, maybe. Consid- 
ered as a problem in psychology, 
it was interesting. 

I noticed she was talking to 
me. “You’ve never had a crew 
of this type before either, have 
you. Commander?” 

“Zombies, you mean? No, this 
is my first. I’m happy to say.” 
She made a disapproving pout 
with her mouth. It was fully as 
cute as her approving pouts. “We 
do not like that word.” 

“All right, blobs then.” 

“We don’t like bl — that word 
either. You are talking about 
human beings like yourself. Com- 
mander. Very much like your- 
self.” 

I began to get sore fast, just 
the way the kid had out in the 



hall. Then I realized she didn’t 
mean anything by it. She didn’t 
know. What the hell — it wasn’t 
on our orders. I relaxed. “You 
tell me. What do you call them 
here?” 

blonde sat up stiffly. “We 
refer to them as soldier sur- 
rogates. The epithet ‘zombie’ was 
used to describe the obsolete 
Model 21, which went out of 
production over five years ago. 
You will be supplied with indi- 
viduals based on Model 705 and 
706, which are practically perfect. 
In fact, in some respects — ” 

“No bluish skin? No slow-mo- 
tion sleepwalking?” 

She shook her head violently. 
Her eyes lit up. Evidently she’d 
digested all the promotional lit- 
erature. Not such a fluffhead, af- 
ter all — no great mind, but her 
husbands had evidently had 
someone to talk to at times. She 
rattled on enthusiastically. 

“The cyanosis was the result 
of bad Mood oxygenation — ^blood 
was our second most difficult tis- 
sue reconstruction problem. The

usually in the poorest shape of 
all, when the bodies arrive, we

able rebuilt heart. But let there 
be the teeniest battle damage to

to start right from scratch. And

then the troubles in reconstitu- 
tion! 

“My cousin Loma works in 
Neural Alignment, and she tells 
me all you need to make is just 
one wrong connection — ^you know 
how it is, Commander. At the 
end of the day your eyes are 
tired, and you’re kind of watch- 
ing the clock — just one wrong 
connection, and the reflexes in 
the finished individual turn out 
so bad that they just have to 
send him down to the third floor 
and begin all over again. But 
you don’t have to worry about 
that. Since Model 663, we’ve been 
using the two-team inspection 
system in Neural Alignment. 
And the 700 series— oh, they’ve 
just been wonderful.” 

“That good, eh? Better than 
the old-fashioned mother’s son 
type?” 

“Well-1-1.” She considered. 
“You’d really be amazed. Com- 
mander, if you could see the very 
latest performance charts. Of 
course, there is always that big 
deficiency, the one activity we’ve 
never been able to — ” 

“One thing / can’t understand,” 
the kid broke in. “Why do they 
have to use corpses? A body’s 
lived its life, fought its war — why 
not leave it alone? I know the 
Eoti can outbreed us merely by 
increasing the number of queens 
in their flagships, I know that 
manpower is the biggest single 



TAF problem — but we’ve been 
synthesizing protoplasm for a 
long, long time now. Why not 
synthesize the whole damn body, 
from toenails to frontal lobe, and 
turn out real honest-to-God an- 
droids that don’t wallop you with 
the stink of death when you meet 
them?” 

blonde got mad. “Our 
product does not stink! Cos- 
metics can now guarantee that the 
new models have even less of a 
body odor than you, young man! 
And we do not reactivate or revi- 
talize corpses. I’ll have you know. 
What we do is reclaim human 
protoplasm. We re-use worn-out 
and damaged human cellular ma- 
terial in the area where the great- 
est shortages currently occur, 
military personnel. You wouldn’t 
talk about corpses, I assure you, 
if you saw the condition that 
some of those bodies are in when 
they arrive. Why, sometimes, in 
an entire baling package — a bal- 
ing package contains twenty cas- 
ualities — we don’t find enough to 
make one good, whole kidney. 
Then we have to take a little in- 
testinal tissue here and a bit of 
spleen there, alter them, unite 
them carefully, activa — ” 

“That’s what I mean. If you go 
to all that trouble, why not start 
with real raW material?” 

“Like what, for example?” she 
asked him. 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



kid gestured with his 
black-gloved hands. “Basic 
elements — carbon, hydrogen, ox- 
ygen and so on.” 

“Basic elements have to come 
from somewhere,” I pointed out 
gently. “You might take your 
hydrogen and oxygen from air 
and water. But from where 
would you get your carbon?” 
“From the same place where 
the other synthetic manufactur- 
ers get it — coal, oil, cellulose.” 
The receptionist sat back and 
relaxed. “Those are organic sub- 
stances,” she reminded him. “If 
you’re going to use raw material 
that was once alive, why not use 
the kind that comes as close as 
possible to the end product you 
have in mind? It’s simple indus- 
trial economics. Commander, be- 
lieve me. The best and cheapest 
raw material for the manufac- 
ture of soldier surrogates are 
soldier bodies.” 

“Sure,” the kid said. “Makes 
sense. There’s no other use for 
dead, old, beaten-up soldier bod- 
ies. Better’n shoving them in the 
ground, where they’d be just 
waste, pure waste.” 

Our little blonde chum started 
to smile in agreement, then shot 
him an intense glance and 
changed her mind. She looked 
very uncertain all of a sudden. 
When the communicator on her 
desk buzzed, she bent over it 
eagerly. 



I watched her with approval. 
Definitely no fluffhead. Just very 
feminine. I sighed. You see, I 
judge plenty of people the wrong 
way, but only with women is my 
wrongness an all-the-time prop- 
osition. Proving again, that a 
hell of a lot of peculiar things 
turn out to have happened for 
the best. 

“Commander,” she was saying 
to the kid, “would you go to 
Room 1591? Your crew will be 
there in a moment.” She turned 
to me. “And Room 1524 for you, 
straight ahead, Commander, if 
you please.” 

The kid nodded and walked 
off, very straight and erect. I 
waited until the door had closed 
behind him, then I leaned close 
to the receptionist. “Wish they’d 
change the Breeding Regulations 
again,” I told her. “You’d make 
a damn fine rear-echelon orienta- 
tion officer. I got more feel of The 
Junkyard from you than in ten 
briefing sessions.” 

She examined my face anxious- 
ly. “I hope you mean that. Com- 
mander. You see, we’re all very 
deeply involved in this project. 
We’re extremely proud of the 
progress the Third District Fin- 
ishing Plant has made. We talk 
about the new developments all 
the time, everywhere — even in the 
cafeteria. It didn’t occur to me 
until too late that you gentlemen 
might — ” she blushed deep rich

red, the way only a blonde can 
blush — “might take what I said 
personally. I’m sorry if I — ” 
“Nothing to be sorry about,” 
I assured her. “All you did was 
talk shop. Like when I was in the 
hospital last month and heard 
two surgeons discussing how to 
repair a man’s arm, and making 
it sound as if they were going to 
nail a new arm back on an ex- 
pensive chair. Real interesting 
and 1 learned a lot.” 

I left her looking grateful, 
which is absolutely the only way 
to leave a woman, and barged on 
to Room 1524. 

Ill 

TT was evidently used as a class- 
room when reconverted human 
junk wasn’t being picked up. A 
bunch of chairs, a long black- 
board, a couple of charts. ® 
One of the charts was on the 
Eoti, the basic information list 
that contains all the limited in- 
formation we have been able to 
assemble on the bugs in the 
bloody quarter-century since they 
came busting in past Pluto to 
take over the Solar System. It 
hadn’t been changed much since 
the one I’d had to memorize in 
high school — the only difference 
was a slightly longer section on 
intelligence and motivation. Just 
theory, of course, but more care- 
fully thought-out theory than 



the stuff I’d learned. The big 
brains had now concluded that 
the reason all attempts at com- 
municating with them had failed 
was not because they were a 
conquest-crazy species, but be- 
cause they suffered from the same 
extreme xenophobia as their 
smaller, less intelligent commu- 
nal insect cousins here on Earth. 

That is, an ant wanders up to 
a strange ant hill — zok ! — no dis- 
cussion, he’s chopped down at 
the entrance. And the soldier ants 
react even faster if it’s a creature 
of another genus. So despite the 
Eoti science, which in far too 
many respects is more advanced 
than ours, they are psychological- 
ly incapable of the kind of mental 
projection or empathy necessary 
if one is to realize that a com- 
pletely alien-looking neighbor has 
intelligence, feelings — and rights! 
The same as oneself. Far too 
many humans lack this kind of 
empathy, for that matter. 

Well, it might be so. Mean- 
while, we were locked in a mur- 
derous stalemate with the Eoti 
on a perimeter of never-ending 
battle that sometimes expanded 
as far as Saturn and occasionally 
contracted as close as Jupiter. 
Barring the invention of a new 
weapon of such unimaginable 
power that we could wreck their 
fleet before they could duplicate 
the weapon — as they’d been man- 
aging to up to now — our only

hope was to somehow discover 
the stellar system from which 
they came, somehow build our- 
selves not one starship, but a fleet 
of them — and somehow wreck 
their home base or throw enough 
of a scare into it sd^that they’d 
pull back their expedition for 
defensive purposes. A lot of 
somehows. 

But, if we wanted to maintain 
our present position until the 
somehows started to roll, our 
birth announcements had to take 
longer to read than the casualty 
lists. For the last decade, this 
hadn’t been so, despite the more 
and more stringent Breeding Reg- 
ulations, which were steadily 
pulverizing every one of our mor- 
al codes and sociological ad- 
vances. Then, someone in the 
Conservation Police noticed that 
almost half our ships of the line 
had been fabricated from the 
metallic junk of previous battles. 
Where was the personnel that had 
manned those salvaged derelicts, 
he wondered . 

And thus arrived what Blondie, 
outside, and her co-workers were 
diplomatic enough to call soldier 
surrogates. 

T’D been a computer’s mate, 
second class, on the old Jeng- 
hiz Kahn when the first batch had 
come aboard as battle replace- 
ments. 

Let me tell you, we had 



real good reason for calling them 
zombies! Most of them were as 
blue as the uniforms they wore, 
their breathing was so noisy it 
made you think of asthmatics 
with built-in public address sys- 
tems, their eyes shone with all 
the intelligence of petroleum jel- 
ly — and the way they walked! 

My friend, Johnny Cruro, the 
first man to get knocked off in 
the Great Breakthrough of 2143, 
used to say that they walked as 
if they were trying to pick their 
way down a steep hill at the bot- 
tom of which was a large, open, 
family-size grave. Body held 
strained and tense — legs and arms 
moving slow, slow, until suddenly 
they’d finish with a jerk — creepy 
as hell. 

They weren’t good for any- 
thing but the drabbest fatigue de- 
tail. And even then ... If you 
told them to polish a gun mount- 
ing, you had to remember to 
come back in an hour and turn 
them off, or they might scrub 
their way ^clear through into 
empty space. Of course, they 
weren’t all that bad. Johnny 
Cruro used to say he’d met one 
or two who could achieve im- 
becility when they were feeling 
right. 

Combat was what finished 
them, so far as the TAF was 
concerned. Not that they broke 
under battle conditions — just the 
reverse. The old ship would be

rocking and screaming as it 
changed course every few seconds, 
every Irvingle, scrambler and nu- 
cleonic howitzer along the firing 
corridor turning bright golden 
yellow from the heat it was gen- 
erating, a hoarse, yelping voice 
from the bulkhead loudspeakers 
pouring out orders, men stagger- 
ing from one emergency station 
to another, everyone around you 
working like a blur and cursing 
and wondering out loud why the 
Eoti were taking so long to tag a 
target as big and as slow as the 
Khan. Then, suddenly, you’d see 
a zombie clutching a broom in 
his rubbery hands and sweeping 
the deck in the slack-jawed, mo- 
ronic and horribly earnest way 
they had . 

I remember whole gun crews 
going amuck and slamming into 
the zombies with long crowbars 
and metal-gloved fists. Once, 
even an officer, sprinting back to 
the control room, flipped out his 
side-arm and pumped bolt after 
bolt of jagged thunder at a blue- 
skin who’d been peacefully wip- 
ing a porthole while the bow of 
the ship was being burned away. 
And, as the zombie sagged un- 
comprehendingly and uncom- 
plainingly to the floor-plates, the 
young officer stood over him and 
chanted soothingly, the way you 
do to a boisterous dog, “Down, 
boy, down. Down, down, damn 
you, DOWN!" 




T^HAT was the reason the zom- 
bies were eventually pulled 
back. Not because of inefficiency 
— the incidence of battle psycho 
around them just shot up too 
high. Maybe, if it hadn’t been 
for that, we’d have gotten used 
to them eventually — God knows 
you get used to enough in com- 
bat. But the zombies belonged to 
something beyond mere war. 

They were so terribly, terribly 
unstirred by the prospect of dy- 
ing again! 

Well, everyone said the new 
models were a big improvement. 
They’d better be. A slingshot may

be one thin notch below an out- 
right suicide patrol, but you need 
peak performance from every 
man aboard if you’re going to 
complete its crazy mission, let 
alone return. And it’s an awful 
small ship, and the men have to 
kind of get along with each other 
in very close quarters. 

I heard feet, several pairs of 
them, rapping along the corridor. 
They stopped outside the door. 

They waited. I waited. My skin 
began to prickle. And then I 
heard that uncertain shuffling 
sound. They were nervous about 
meeting me! 



I walked over to the window 
and stared down at the drill field, 
where old veterans, whose minds 
and bodies were too worn-out to 
be repaired, taught fatigue-uni- 
formed zombies how to use their 
newly conditioned reflexes in 
close-order drill. 

And then, when the hands I’d 
clasped behind me had almost 
squeezed their blood back into 
my wrists, I heard the door open 
and four pairs of feet clatter into 
the room. The door closed, and 
four pairs of feet clicked to at- 
tention. 

I turned around. 



DOWN AMONG THE DEAD 



MEN

They were saluting me. Well, 
what the hell, I told myself, 
they’re supposed to be saluting 
me. I am their commanding of- 
ficer. I returned the salute and 
four arms whipped down smartly. 

I said, “At ease.” They snap- 
ped their legs apart, arms behind 
them. I thought about it and 
said, “Rest.” They relaxed their 
bodies slightly. I thought about 
it again. I said, “Hell, men, sit 
down and let’s meet each other.” 

They sprawled into chairs, and 
I hitched myself up on the in- 
structor’s desk. We stared back 
and forth. Their faces were rigid, 
watchful — they weren’t giving 
anything away. 

I wondered what my face look- 
ed like. In spite of all the orienta- 
tion lectures, in spite of all the 
preparation, I must admit that 
my first glimpse of them had hit 
me hard. They were glowing with 
health, normalcy and hard pur- 
pose. But that wasn’t it. 

That wasn’t it at all! 

What was making me want to 
run out of the door, out of the 
building, was something I’d been 
schooling myself to expect since 
that last briefing session in Ari- 
zona Base. Four dead men were 
staring at me. Four very famous 
dead men. 

The big man, lounging all over 
his chair, was Roger Grey, who 
had been killed over a year ago 
when he rammed his tiny scout- 



ship up the forward jets of an 
Eoti flagship. He’d split the flag- 
ship neatly in two. Almost every 
medal imaginable and the Solar 
Corona. Grey was to be my co- 
pilot. 

^^HE thin, alert man with the 
tight shock of black hair was 
Wang Hsi. He had been killed 
covering the retreat to the aster- 
oids after the Great Breakthrough 
of 2143. According to the fan- 
tastic story the observers told, 
his ship had still been firing after 
it had been scrambled three times. 
Almost every medal imaginable 
and the Solar Corona. Wang was 
to be my engineer. 

The darkish little fellow was 
Yussuf Lamehd. He’d been killed 
in a very minor skirmish off Ti- 
tan, but at the time of his death, 
he was the most decorated man 
in the entire TAF. A double Solar 
Corona. Lamehd was to be my 
gunner. 

The heavy one was Stanley 
Weinstein, the only prisoner of 
war ever to escape from the Eoti. 
There wasn’t much left of him 
by the time he’d arrived on Mars, 
but the ship he had come in was 
the first enemy craft that human- 
ity could study intact. There was 
no Solar Corona in his day for 
him to receive even posthumous- 
ly, but they’re still naming mili- 
tary academies after him. Wein- 
stein was to be my astrogator.

Then I shook myself back to 
reality. These weren’t the original 
heroes, probably didn’t have even 
one particle of Roger Grey’s 
blood or Wang Hsi’s flesh upon 
their reconstructed bones. They 
were just excellent and faithful 
copies, made to minute physical 
specifications which had been in 
the TAF medical files since Wang 
had been a cadet and Grey a 
young recruit. 

IV 

rpHERE were anywhere from 
a hundred to a thousand Yus- 
suf Lamehds and Stanley Wein- 
steins, I had to remind myself — 
and they had all come off an 
assembly line a few floors down. 
“Only the brave deserve the fu- 
ture,” was The Junkyard’s motto, 
and it was currently trying to 
assure that future for them by 
duplicating in quantity any TAF 
man who went out with especial 
heroism. 

There was that little gimmick 
of industrial efficiency again. If 
you’re using mass production 
methods, and The Junkyard was 
doing just that, it’s plain common 
sense to turn out a few standard- 
ized models, rather than have 
everyone different — like the stuff 
an individual creative craftsman 
might come up with. Well, if they 
are to be standardized models, 
why not use those that have posi- 



tive and relatively pleasant 
associations bound up with their 
appearance rather than anony- 
mous characters from the design- 
ers’ drawing boards? 

Another reason for using hero 
models was almost more impor- 
tant and harder to define. Ac- 
cording to the briefing officer 
yesterday, there was an obscure 
feeling — a superstitious feeling, 
almost — that, if you copied a 
hero’s features, musculature, 
metabolism and even his cortex 
wrinkles carefully enough, you 
might build yourself another hero. 
Of course, the original personality 
would never reappear — that had 
been produced by long years of 
environment and dozens of other 
very slippery factors — but it was 
distinctly possible, the bio-techs 
felt, that a modicum of useful 
courage resided in the body struc- 
ture alone. 

Well, at least these zombies 
didn’t look like zombies! For 
which I was grateful. 

On impulse, I plucked the roll- 
ed sheaf of papers containing our 
travel orders out of my pocket, 
pretended to study it and let it 
slip suddenly through my fingers. 
As the outspread sheaf spiraled to 
the floor in front of me, Roger 
Grey reached out and caught it. 
He handed it back to me with the 
same kind of easy yet snappy 
grace. I took it, feeling good. It 
was the way he moved. I like to

see a co-pilot move that way. 

“Thanks,” I said. 

He just nodded. 

T STUDIED Yussuf Lamehd 
next. Yes, he had it too. What- 
ever it is that makes a first-class 
gunner, he had it. It’s almost 
impossible to describe, but you 
walk into a bar in some rest area 
on Eros, say, and out of the five 
slingshotters hunched over the 
blowtop table, you know right off 
which is the gunner. It’s a sort of 
carefully bottled nervousness or 
a dead calm with a hair-trigger 
attachment. Whatever it is, it’s 
what you need. Lamehd had it so 
strong I’d have put money on 
him against any other gunner in 
the TAP I’d ever seen in action. 

Astrogators and engineers are 
different. You’ve got to see them 
work under pressure before you 
can begin to rate them. But, even 
so, I liked the calm and confident 
manner with which Wang Hsi 
and Weinstein sat under my ex- 
amination. And I liked them. 

Right then, I felt a hundred 
pounds slide off my chest. I felt 
relaxed for the first time in days. 
I really liked my crew, zombies 
or no. We’d make it. 

I decided to tell them. “Men,” 
I said, “I think we’ll really get 
along. I think we’ve got the mak- 
ings of a sweet, smooth slingshot. 
You’ll find me — ” 

And I stopped. That cold, 



slightly mocking look in their 
eyes. The way they had glanced 
at each other when I told them 
I thought we’d get along, glanced 
at each other and blown slightly 
through distended nostrils. I 
realized that none of them had 
said anything since they’d come 
in. They’d just been watching me 
and their eyes weren’t exactly 
warm. 

I stopped and let my mind take 
a long, deep breath. For the first 
time, it was occurring to me that 
I’d been worrying about just one 
end of the problem, maybe the 
least important end. I’d been 
worrying about how I’d react to 
them and how much I’d be able 
to accept them as shipmates. 
They were zombies, after all. It 
had never occurred to me to won- 
der how they’d feel about me. 

And there was evidently some- 
thing very wrong in how they 
felt about me. 

“What is it, men?” I asked. 
They all looked at me inquiring- 
ly. “What’s on your minds? 
What’s bothering you?” 

They kept looking at me. 
Weinstein pursed his lips and 
tilted his chair back and forth. It 
creaked. Nobody said anything. 

“Grey,” I said walking up and 
down in the front of the class- 
room. “You look as if you’ve got 
a great big knot inside you. Want 
to tell me about it?” 

“No, Commander,” he said 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



slowly and deliberately. “I do 
not want to tell you about it.” 

I grimaced. “If anyone wants 
to say anything — anything at 
all — it’ll be off the record — 
completely off the record. Also, 
for the moment, we’ll forget about 
such matters as rank and TAF 
regulations.” I waited. “Wang? 
Lamehd? How about you, Wein- 
stein?” They stared at me sil- 
ently. Weinstein’s chair creaked 
back and forth. 

TT had me baffled. What kind 
-*■ of gripe could they have 
against me? They’d never met me 
before. But I knew one thing — 
I wasn’t going to haul a crew 
nursing a sub-surface grudge as 
unanimous as this aboard a sling- 
shot. I wasn’t going to chop space 
with those eyes at my back. It 
would be more efficient for me to 
shove my head against an Ir- 
vingle lens and push the button. 

“Listen,” I told them, “I meant 
what I said about forgetting rank 
and TAF regulations. I want to 
run a happy ship, and I have to 
know what’s up. We’ll be living 
— the five of us — in the tightest, 
most cramped conditions Man 
has yet been able to devise. We’ll 
be operating a tiny ship whose 
only purpose is to dodge, at tre- 
mendous speed, through the fire- 
power and screening devices of 
the largest enemy craft and de- 
liver a single, crippling blast from 



a single, oversize Irvingle. If we 
don’t get along, if there’s any 
unspoken hostility getting in our 
way, the ship won’t operate at 
maximum efficiency. And that 
way, we’re through before we — ” 

“Commander,” Weinstein said 
suddenly, his chair coming down 
upon the floor with a solid whack, 
“I’d like to ask you a question.” 

“Sure,” I said and let out a 
gust of relief that was the size of 
a small hurricane. “Ask me any- 
thing.” 

“When you think about us. 
Commander, or when you talk 
about us, which word do you 
use?” 

I looked at him and shook my 
head. “Eh?” 

“When you talk about us. 
Commander, or when you think 
about us, do you call us zombies? 
Or do you call us blobs? That’s 
what I’d like to know. Com- 
mander. That’s what I’m curious 
about.” 

He’d spoken in such a polite, 
even tone that I was a long time 
getting the full significance of it. 

“Personally,” said Roger Grey 
in a voice that was just a little 
less polite, a little less even. 
“Personally, I think the Com- 
mander is the kind who refers 
to us as canned meat. Right, 
Commander?” 

Yussuf Lamehd folded his 
arms across his chest and seem- 
ed to consider the issue very 



DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN 



95 



thoughtfully. “I think you’re 
right, Rog. He’s the canned-meat 
type. Definitely the canned-meat 
type.” 

“No,” said Wang Hsi. “He 
doesn’t use that kind of language. 
Zombies, yes — canned meat, no. 
You can observe from the way he 
talks that he wouldn’t ever get 
mad enough to tell us to get back 
in the can. And I don’t think he’d 
call us blobs very often. He’s the 
kind of guy who’d buttonhole 
another slingshot commander and 
tell him, ‘Man, have I got the 
sweetest zombie crew you ever 
saw!’ That’s the way I figure 
him. Zombies.” 

And then they were sitting 
quietly, staring at me again. And 
it wasn’t mockery in their eyes. 
It was hatred. 

T WENT back to the desk and 
sat down. The room was very 
still. From the yard, fifteen floors 
down, the marching commands 
drifted up. Where did they latch 
on to this zombie — blob — 
canned-meat stuff? They were 
none of them more than six 
months old; they had none of 
them been outside the precincts 
of The Junkyard yet. Their con- 
ditioning, while mechanical and 
intensive, was supposed to be 
absolutely foolproof, producing 
hard, resilient and entirely hu- 
man minds, highly skilled in their 
various specialties and as far 



from any kind of imbalance as 
the latest psychiatric knowledge 
could push them. I knew they 
wouldn’t have gotten it in their 
conditioning. Then where . .? 

And then I heard it clearly for 
a moment. The word that was 
being used down in the drill field 
instead of Hup! That strange 
new word I had only heard in- 
distinctly through the window. 
Whoever was calling the cadence 
downstairs wasn’t saying, “Hup, 
two, three, four!” 

He was saying, “Blob, two, 
three, four! Blob, two, three 
four!” 

Wasn’t that just like the TAP, 
I asked myself? For that matter, 
like any army anywhere, any- 
time? To expend fortunes and 
the best minds producing a high- 
ly necessary product to exact 
specifications, and then, on the 
very first level of military use, 
doing something that might in- 
validate it completely! I visual- 
ized those TAP drill-hacks with 
their narrow, nasty minds, as jeal- 
ously proud of their prejudices 
as of their limited and painfully 
acquired military knowledge, giv- 
ing these youngsters before me 
their first taste of genuine bar- 
racks life, their first glimpse of 
the “outside.” It was so stupid! 

But was it? There .was another 
way of looking at it, beyond the 
fact that only soldiers too old 
physically and too ossified men- 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tally for any other duty could be 
spared for this place. And that 
was the simple pragmatism of 
army thinking. The fighting peri- 
meters were places of abiding 
horror and agony. The forward 
combat zones in which slingshots 
operated were even worse. If men 
or materials were going to col- 
lapse out there, it could be very 
costly. Let the collapses occur as 
close to the rear echelons as pos- 
sible. 

l^/rAYBE it made sense, I 
thought. Maybe it was logi- 
cal to make live men out of dead 
men’s flesh at such enormous ex- 
pense, and with the kind of care 
usually associated with things 
like cotton wool and the most 
delicate watchmakers’ tools, and 
then to turn around and subject 
them to the coarsest, ugliest 
environment possible, an environ- 
ment that perverted their care- 
fully instilled loyalty into hatred, 
their finely balanced psychologi- 
cal adjustment into neurotic sen- 
sitivity. 

I didn’t know if it was basically 
smart or dumb, or even if the 
problem had ever been really 
weighed as such by the upper, 
policy-making brass. All I could 
see was my own problem, and it 
looked awfully big to me. I 
thought of my attitude toward 
these men before meeting them, 
and I felt pretty sick. But the 



membry gave me an idea. 

“Hey, tell me something,” I 
suggested. “What would you call 
me?” 

They looked puzzled. 

“You want to know what I call 
you,” I explained. “Tell me first 
what you call people like me, 
people who are — who are born. 
You must have your own epi- 
thets.” 

Lamehd grinned so that his 
teeth showed a bright, mirthless 
white against his dark skin. 
“Realos,” he said. “We call you 
people realos. Sometimes realo 
trulos.” 

Then the rest spoke up. There 
were other- names, lots of other 
names. They wanted me to hear 
them all. They interrupted each 
other; they spat the words out as 
if they were missiles. They glared 
at my face, as they spat them out, 
to see how much impact they had. 
Some of the nicknames were 
funny, some of them were rather 
nasty. I was particularly charm- 
ed by utie and wombat. 

“All right,” I said after a while. 
“Feel better?” 

They were all breathing hard, 
but they felt better. I could tell 
it, and they knew it. The air in 
the room felt softer now. 

“First off,” I said, “I want 
you to notice that you are all big 
boys and, as such, can take care 
of yourselves. From here on out, 
if we walk into a> bar or a rec

camp together, and someone of 
approximately your rank says 
something that sounds like zom- 
bie to your acute ears, you are 
at liberty to walk up to him and 
start taking him apart — if you 
can. If he’s of approximately my 
rank, in all probability. I'll do 
the taking apart, simply because 
I’m a very sensitive commander. 
And any time you feel that I’m 
not treating you as human beings, 
one hundred per cent, full solar 
citizenship and all that, I give you 
permission to come up to me and 
say, ‘Now look here, you dirty 
utie, sir . .’ ” 

The four of them grinned. 
Warm grins. Then the grins faded 
away, very slowly, and the eyes 
grew cold again. They were look- 
ing at a man who was, after all, 
an outsider. 

“It’s not as simple as that. 
Commander,’’ Wang Hsi said. 
“Unfortunately. You can call us 
hundred per cent human beings, 
but we’re not. And anyone who 
wants to call us blobs or canned 
meat has a certain right. Because 
we’re not as good as — as you 
mothers’ sons, and we know it. 
And we’ll never be that good. 
Never!’’ 

“I don’t know about that,” I 
blustered. “Why, some of your 
performance charts . .” 

“Performance charts. Com- 
mander,” Wang Hsi said softly, 
“do not a human being make.” 



On his right, Weinstein gave 
a nod, thought a bit and added, 
“Nor groups of men a race.” 

V 

¥ KNEW where we were going 
now. And I wanted to smash 
my way out of that room, down 
the elevator and out of the build- 
ing before anybody said another 
word. This is it, I told myself. 
Here fve are, boy, here we are. 
I found myself squirming from 
corner to corner of the desk. I 
gave up, got off it and began 
walking again. 

Wang Hsi wouldn’t let go. I 
should have known he wouldn’t. 
“Soldier surrogates,” he went on, 
squinting as if he were taking a 
close look at the phrase for the 
first time. “Soldier surrogates, but 
not soldiers. We’re not soldiers, 
because soldiers are men. And 
we. Commander, are not men.” 
There was silence for a mo- 
ment, then a tremendous blast of 
sound boiled out of my mouth. 
“And what makes you think that 
you’re not men?” 

Wang Hsi was looking at me 
with astonishment, but his reply 
was still soft and calm. “You 
know why. You’ve seen our spe- 
cifications, Commander. We’re 
not men, real men, because we 
can’t reproduce ourselves.” 

I forced myself to sit down 
again and carefully placed my

shaking hands over my knees. 

“We’re as sterile,’’ I heard Yus- 
suf Lamehd say, “as boiling 
water.’’ 

“There have been lots of men,” 
I began, “who have been — ” 
“This isn’t a matter of lots of 
men,” Weinstein broke in. “This 
is a' matter of us — all of us.” 
“Blobs thou art,” Wang Hsi 
murmured, “and to blobs return- 
eth. They might have given at 
least a few of us a chance. The 
kids mightn’t have turned out so 
bad.” 

Roger Grey slammed his huge 
hand down on the arm of his 
chair. “That’s just the point, 
Wang,” he said savagely. “The 
kids might have turned out good 
— too good. Our kids might have 
turned out to be better than their 
kids — and where would that 
leave the proud and cocky, the 
goddam name-calling, the lealo 
trulo human race?” 

I sat staring at them once more, 
but now I was seeing a different 
picture. I wasn’t seeing conveyor 
belts moving slowly along, cov- 
ered with human tissues and or- 
gans on which earnest bio-techs 
performed their individual tasks. 
I wasn’t seeing a room filled with 
dozens of adult male bodies sus- 
pended in nutrient solution, each 
body connected to a conditioning 
machine which, day and night, 
clacked out whatever minimum 
information was necessary for the 



body to take the place of a man 
in the bloodiest part of the fight- 
ing perimeter. 

^^HIS time, I saw a barracks 
filled with heroes, many of 
them in duplicate and triplicate. 
And they were sitting around 
griping, as men will in any bar- 
racks on any planet, whether 
they looked like heroes or not. 
But their gripes concerned 
humiliations deeper than any sol- 
diers had hitherto known — humi- 
liations as basic as the fabric of 
human personality. 

“You believe, then,” and de- 
spite the sweat on my face, my 
voice was gentle, “that the re- 
productive power was deliberate- 
ly withheld?” 

Weinstein scowled. “Now Com- 
mander. Please. No bedtime 
stories.” 

“Doesn’t it occur to you at all 
that the whole problem of our 
species at the moment is repro- 
duction? Believe me, men, that’s 
all you hear about on the out- 
side. Grammar school debating 
teams kick current reproductive 
issues back and forth in the dis- 
trict medal competitions. Every 
month, scholars in archeology 
and the botany of fungi come out 
with books about it from their 
own special angle. Everyone 
knows that if we don’t lick the 
reproduction problem, the Eoti 
are going to lick us. Do you seri- 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ously think that, under such cir- 
cumstances, the reproductive 
powers of anyone would be in- 
tentionally impaired?” 

“What do a few male blobs 
matter, more or less?” Grey 
demanded. “According to the lat- 
est news bulletins, sperm bank de- 
posits are at their highest point 
in five years. They don’t need 
us.” 

“Commander,” Wang Hsi 
pointed his triangular chin at 
me, “let me ask you a few ques- 
tions. Do you honestly expect us 
to believe that a science capable 
of reconstructing a living, highly 
effective human body with a com- 
plex digestive system and a most 
delicate nervous system is in- 
capable of reconstructing the 
germ plasm in one single, soli- 
tary case?” 

“You have to believe it,” I 
told him, “because it’s so.” 

Wang sat back, and so did the 
other three. They stopped looking 
at me. 

“Haven’t you ever heard it 
said,” I pleaded with them, “that 
the germ plasm is more essen- 
tially the individual than any 
other part of him? That some 
whimsical biologists take the at- 
titude that our human bodies and 
all bodies are merely vehicles, or 
hosts, by means of which our 
germ plasm reproduces itself? It’s 
the most complex bio-technical 
riddle we have. Believe me, men,” 



I added passionately, “when I 
say that biology has not yet 
solved the germ plasm problem. 
I’m telling the truth. I know.” 
That got them. 

“Look,” I said. “We have one 
thing in common with the Eoti 
whom we’re fighting. Insects and 
warm-blooded animals differ 
amazingly. But only among the 
community-building insects and 
the community-building men are 
there individuals who, while tak- 
ing no part personally in the 
reproductive chain, are of funda- 
mental importance to their spe- 
cies. For example, you might 
have a female nursery-school- 
teacher who is barren, but who is 
of unquestionable value in shap- 
ing the personalities and even 
physiques of children in her care.” 
“Fourth Orientation Lecture 
for Soldier Surrogates,” Wein- 
stein said in a dry voice. “He got 
it right out of the book.” 

“I’ve been wounded,” I said. 
“I’ve been seriously wounded fif- 
teen times.” I stood before them 
and began rolling up my right 
sleeve. It was soaked with my 
perspiration. 

“ can tell you’ve been 

wounded. Commander,” 
Lamehd pointed out uncertainly. 
“We can tell from your medals. 
You don’t have to — ” 

“And every time I was wound- 
ed, they repaired me good as new. 



DOWN AMONG THE DEAD 



MEN 



101 



Better. Look at that arm.” I 
flexed it for them. “Before it was 
burned off in a small razzle six 
years ago, I could never build up 
a muscle that big. It’s a better 
arm that they built on the stump 
and, believe me, my reflexes never 
had it so good.’’ 

“What did you mean,” Wang 
Hsi started to ask me, “when you 
said before — ” 

“Fifteen times I was wounded,” 
my voice drowned him out, “and 
fourteen times the wound was re- 
paired. The fifteenth time — the 
fifteenth time — well, the fifteenth 
time it wasn’t a wound they could 
repair. They couldn’t help me one 
bit the fifteenth time.” 

Roger Grey opened his mouth. 

“Fortunately,” I whispered, 
“it wasn’t a wound that showed.” 

Weinstein started to ask me 
something, decided against it and 
sat back. But I had told him 
what he wanted to know. 

“A nucleonic howitzer. The 
way it was figured later, it had 
been a defective shell. Bad 
enough to kill half the men on 
our second-class cruiser. I wasn’t 
killed, but I was in range of the 
backblast.” 

“That backblast.” Lamehd was 
thinking aloud. “That backblast 
will sterilize anybody within two 
hundred feet, unless he’s wear- 
ing — ” 

“And I wasn’t.” I had stopped 
sweating. It was over. My crazy 



little precious secret was out. I 
took a deep breath. “So you 
see — well, anyway, I know they 
haven’t solved that problem yet.” 
Roger Grey stood up and said, 
“Hey!” He held out his hand. I 
shook it. It felt like any normal 
guy’s hand. Stronger, maybe. 

“Slingshot personnel,” I went 
on, “are all volunteers. Except for 
two categories — the command- 
ers and soldier surrogates.” 
“Figuring, I guess,” Weinstein 
asked, “that the human race can 
spare them most easily?” 

“Right,” I said. “Figuring that 
the human race can spare them 
most easily.” 

He nodded. 

“Well, I’ll be damned!” Yussuf 
Lamehd laughed as he got up 
and shook my hand too. “Wel- 
come to our city.” 

“Thanks,” I said, “son.” 

TTE seemed puzzled at the 
emphasis. 

“That’s the rest of it,” I ex- 
plained. “Never got married and 
was too busy getting drunk and 
tearing up the pavement on my 
leaves to visit a sperm bank.” 
“Oho,” Weinstein said, and 
gestured at the walls with a 
thick thumb. “So this is it.” 
“That’s right — this is it — the 
Family. The only one I’ll ever 
have. I’ve got almost enough of 
these — ” I tapped my medals 
— “to rate replacement. As a 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



slingshot commander, I’m sure 
of it.” 

“All you don’t know yet,” 
Lamehd pointed out, “is how high 
a percentage of replacement will 
be apportioned to your memory. 
That depends on how many more 
of those chest decorations you 
collect before you become an — 
ah, should I say raw matenal?" 

“Yeah,” I said, feeling crazily 
light and easy and relaxed. I’d 
gotten it all out, and I didn’t feel 
whipped any more by a billion 
years of reproduction and evolu- 
tion. 

And I’d started out to do a 
morale job on them! 



“Well, boys,” Lamehd said, 
“it seems to me we want the 
commander to get a lot more fruit 
salad. He’s a nice guy, and there 
should be more of him in the 
club.” 

They were all standing around 
me now — Weinstein, Lamehd, 
Grey, Wang Hsi. They looked 
real friendly and real capable. I 
began to feel we were going to 
have one of the best slingshots in 
. what did I mean, one of the 
best? The best, mister, the best. 

“Okay,” said Grey. “Wherever 
and whenever you want to, you 
start leading us — Pop.”

LARGEST OF THEIR KIND 

S OME time ago, I received a 
letter, not from an indivi- 
ual but from a whole high- 
school class in Kansas, asking for 
an article on the question of 
which mammal, bird, reptile, fish 
and so forth is the largest in its 
class, past or present. When I 
started looking things up, I be- 
gan to realize — as you will in a 
little while — ^that Kansas was as 
logical a place as Hollywood to 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ask this particular question. Kan- 
sas may not have any extremely 
large animals to offer at this 
moment, but it certainly is a 
state with a gigantic past! 

To begin somewhere, let’s start 
at the top, with the mammals. 
The largest land mammal of the 
present period is, by a comfort- 
able margin, Loxodon atricanus, 
the African elephant. An old bull 
will stand 11 feet tall and reach 
a weight of from six to eight tons. 
If one can put full trust in the 
reports of big-game hunters, bulls 
standing ll}/^ feet tall have been 
shot in Africa, but I’d feel much 
happier about these reports if the 
trophy had ended up in some 
museum where a measurement 
can be repeated in case of doubt. 
At any event, the African ele- 
phant is, on the average, half a 
foot taller and a ton heavier than 
the nearest runner-up, which is, 
of course, Elephas indicus, the 
Indian elephant. 

TN the not-too-remote past, 
however, it would have been 
the African elephant who would 
have been designated as runner- 
up. No, not to the mammoth — 
at least not to the Siberian mam- 
moth, which was smaller than the 
Indian elephant. But one Euro- 
pean variety of mammoth, found 
in Austria and now on exhibition 
in the Natural History Museum 
of Stuttgart, topped the African 



elephant by 30 inches, and an- 
other variety of extinct elephant, 
Elephas trogontherii, found in 
southwest Germany near Wies- 
baden, topped this giant by an- 
other 10 inches. 

Even this super-elephant, 
though, was not the largest land 
mammal of the past. The record, 
as far as present knowledge goes, 
is held by Baluchxtherium gran- 
geri, a “hornless rhinoceros’’ from 
the Tertiary period of southern 
Asia, which was 27 feet long and 
stood around 18 feet tall. The 
present Indian rhinoceros could 
have walked under a standing 
Baluchitherium without ducking. 

But mammals do not live on 
land only. The marine mammals 
of today hold the record not only 
over the land or marine mammals 
of the past, but also over every- 
thing else that ever moved, in- 
cluding the dinosaurs. 

The largest whale is probably 
the kind called the Blue Rorqual, 
Balaenoptera sibbaldii (or B. 
muscu/us). Even conservative 
naturalists grant this monster a 
body length of 80 to 85 feet. 
(Statements that can be found in 
print go as high as 101 feet.) 
The weight of a fully grown spe- 
cimen of this whale is estimated 
to be close to 150 tons. Even if this 
should be wrong by a couple of 
dozen tons or so, the large whales 
of today are considerably heavier 
than brontosaurus, which is cal-

105 



culated to have weighed in at 38 
tons on the hoof. The whales of 
the geological past, being far 
smaller than those of the present, 
would take at best fourth or fifth 
place. 

Proceeding to the birds, one at 
once gets into the dilemma of 
what to go by, linear dimensions 
or weight. The bird with the larg- 
est wing-spread of the present 
time is the Wandering Albatross, 
the albatros errante of the South 
Americans or Diomedea exulans 
of the ornithologists. The largest 
ever measured had a wing-spread 
of 12 feet and weighed 15 pounds. 
The condor, both South American 
and Californian, comes close with 
a maximum spread of just about 
11 feet, but it weighs as much as 
31 pounds. In the recent past, 
there was an even larger Cali- 
fornia condor that topped the 
wing-spread of the albatross and 
was probably heavier, too, than 
the existing type. 

Naturally, the flightless birds 
are the biggest, for ground instal- 
lations always weigh more than 
airborne equipment. The largest 
of today, the African ostrich, may 
look down at you from a height 
of eight feet and weigh 160 
pounds. 

/~kNLY a few centuries ago, 
however, the African ostrich 
would have been runner-up to 
several other bird giants. 



The biggest of the New Zealand 
moas, Dinornis maximus, was not 
a lot taller (probably just a 
matter of inches), but must have 
weighed more than twfice as 
much. This moa was certainly 
still alive in 1600, the date for 
which the giant ostrichlike bird of 
Madagascar is mentioned as still 
living, though only by hearsay, 
not from personal observation of 
the reporter. 

The Madagascar bird, Aepy- 
ornis ingens, stood 10 feet tall. 
It was of lighter build than 
Dinornis, but it did lay the big- 
gest bird egg known to science — 
almost 14 inches long, with a 
cubic content equal to that of 7 
ostrich eggs or 185 eggs of the 
kind that come by the dozen. 

The largest— or, rather, most 
massive — of extinct birds well 
known to paleontologists was 
Diatryma gigantea, from the low- 
er Eocene of Wyoming. This 
heavy bird, possibly related to 
the cranes of today, had a skull 
almost 20 inches long, with a beak 
to match. Some seven feet tall 
when standing erect, it must have 
weighed well over 300 pounds. 

We now come to the reptiles 
and there, as everybody knows, 
the past greatly outshines the 
present. But the present is not 
doing as badly as most people 
think. 

The large Indian crocodile, 
Crocodilus poTOsus, which shows 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a most remarkable preference for 
salt water and long swims in the 
ocean, would not look too much 
out of place in a Cretaceous land- 
scape. One specimen, of which the 
skull is in the British Museum, 
has been measured by Boulenger 
and found to be 33 feet long, with 
a circumference of 13 feet 8 
inches! 

The largest living turtle is a 
hefty animal, too. It is the leath- 
erback turtle (^Dermochelys) of 
the high seas, which grows to an 
overall length of nine feet, the 
carapace measuring 614 feet, and 
the weight of such a giant is an 
authenticated 1450 pounds. 

The largest living snake is the 
South American anaconda (£u- 
nectes murinus), of which many 
a wild tale has been told. Zoolo- 
gists usually say that this snake 
will reach a length of “well over 
20 feet” and generally will be 
willing to settle for 25 feet as the 
limit. But one reputable source 
mentions a specimen that meas- 
ured 30 feet. However, it was 
measured after death (under- 
standably so) and if you stretch 
a dead snake of such length for 
measuring, you may add one or 
two feet to its “live length” with- 
out meaning to. 

The largest lizardlike reptiles 
of today are, of course, the moni- 
tors. The East Indian Varanus 
Salvator grows to a length of 10 
feet, while the still larger Varanus 



komodoensis, from the small 
island of Komodo in the Sunda 
Sea, is two or three or maybe 
even four feet longer. Both are 
very long-tailed, so that these 
figures are slightly misleading. 
The heaviest Komodo monitor 
actually weighed was just about 
100 pounds. 

A LTHOUGH all these are re- 
spectable figures, they shrink 
by comparison with reptiles from 
former geological periods. The 
one exception is the Indian croco- 
dile. I don’t know of any extinct 
true crocodile that grew as big. 
But the monitors are just small 
leftovers. Only some 20,000 years 
ago, Australia had a monitor 
lizard that was more than 20 feet 
long and may have reached 30 
feet. 

The largest extinct reptiles 
were the sauropod dinosaurs of 
the type of the well-known bron- 
tosaurus. Diplodocus was prob- 
ably the longest because of an 
elongated tail; measurements lie 
between 70 and 75 feet from nose 
to tip of the tail. Not longer, but 
more massive by far, and prob- 
ably the heaviest of the dinosaurs 
was Brachiosaurus brancai from 
the Upper Jurassic period of East 
Africa. The length of the hu- 
merus (bone of the upper arm) of 
Brachiosaurus is 84 inches, as 
compared to 47 inches for the 
same bone in Diplodocus. Brach-

iosaurus could still breathe while 
walking along the bottom of a 
40-foot-deep lake! 

The largest leatherback turtle 
would also look quite small next 
to Archelon ischyros, from the 
Upper Cretaceous of Kansas. 
This marine turtle of some 60 
million years ago must have been 
13^ feet long when alive and 
heavy in proportion, presumably 
around 3500 pounds. Its armor 
had been somewhat reduced for 
the sake of mobility, but there is 
little need for armor in a turtle 



with a three-foot skull and a 
beak like a guillotine. 

For company, Archelon had 
20-foot mosasaurs, swimming 
reptiles with four big paddles, a 
flat tail and long teeth. 

Above the waters where Arche- 
lon and the mosasaurs competed 
for fish, the largest flying animal 
of all Earth’s history wheeled on 
leathery wings, also looking for 
fish. This was Pteranodon in^ens 
— mostly wings, with a ridicu- 
lously small body and legs, but 
with a large though paper-thin 
skull and a long sharp beak. The 
wing-spread of Specimen No. 
2514 has been computed at 26 
feet 9 inches. 

The amphibians of today are 
generally small. A 10-inch sala- 
mander is “big” and a two- 
pound toad something worth 
mentioning. Still, in Japan there 
lives a salamander, called Han- 
zaki and Hazekoi by the Jap- 
anese, which grows to slightly 
over five feet in length. This is 
Megalobatrachus maximus, the 
Japanese giant salamander that 
was discovered about 1825 by the 
German traveler von Siebold and 
caused a small sensation in scien- 
tific circles in its time — not only 
because it is the largest living 
amphibian, but also because it 
was the first case of an animal 
having been known in fossil form 
before being discovered alive. 

To find really large amphibians 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




in the geologic past, we have to 
go back to before the dinosaurs 
to encounter the labyrinthodons, 
so named because of the strange 
construction of their teeth. One 
especially familiar but excep- 
tionally badly named species 
was M astodonsaurus acuminatus, 
from the Triassic of northern 
Europe, with a three-foot skull 
and an overall length of about 
12 feet. 

fishes are another class 
where the present holds its 
own well as compared to the past, 
even though it has to be admitted 
that the record-holders belong to 
an ancient type — namely, the 
sharks. The basking shark (Se- 
lache maxima) is known to reach 
a length of 30 to 35 feet, while 
the whale shark {Rhineodon ty- 
pus), recently made famous by 
Thor Heyerdahl and his Kon- 
Tiki expedition, is well estab- 
lished with 45-foot specimens, 
and even 60 feet has been tenta- 
tively accepted as a possible max- 
imum size. 

Past geological periods have 
not yet furnished anything larger 
than the whale shark among the 
extinct fishes. A possible excep- 
tion is a fossil shark called Car- 
charodon megalodon, from the 
Miocene of the Vienna area. Only 
the teeth are known so far, and 
if the size of the shark was in 
proportion to the size of these 



teeth, it might have been larger 
than Rhineodon. 

Now don’t dismiss the inverte- 
brates as tiny. True, they usually 
are, for a one-inch beetle will be 
considered a big fellow and a six- 
inch earthworm “enormous” and 
the African snail Achatina fulica, 
which the Japanese spread over a 
large number of Pacific islands 
as a food supply during the Sec- 
ond World 'War, is known as the 
“giant snail.” Its shell is five 
inches long and its overall length 
nine inches; it is the second larg- 
est of the land snails of our era. 
(The largest, also African, is 
about a foot long.) But there are 
a number of other impressive ex- 
ceptions from the rule that most 
invertebrates are small. 

The largest clam of our time — 
and of the past, too, as far as is 
known — is Tridacna gigas, which 
occurs near the Philippines, on 
the Great Barrier Reef of Aus- 
tralia and generally in that area. 
It can reach a size of five feet 
and a weight of 500 pounds. 
Its virtually indestructible shells 
were brought to Europe for cen- 
turies and were often used as 
basins for holy water in small 
churches, especially in Bavaria 
and Austria. “Two-thirds of my 
class should make excellent nat- 
uralists; they have been baptized 
from Tridacna shells,” a south 
German zoology instructor once 
said to me.

The largest molluscs are the 
giant squid, the Kraken of the 
Norse, but unfortunately nobody 
can give any definite figures. One 
killed by the crew of the French 
corvette Alecton in 1861 could not 
be actually measured, since the 
crew of the ship, although they 
tried hard, failed to hoist it 
aboard. But the monster was di- 
rectly alongside the ship, so that 
a good and reliable estimate 
could be made — 50 feet without 
the tentacles! 

No giant fossils of a compar- 
able type are known, but armor- 
less octopi would hardly fossilize. 
They would be eaten by a large 
variety of marine creatures be- 
fore mud or sand could cover the 
body. However, some octopi pro- 
duce shells the way the living 
nautilus does and such shells fos- 
silize easily. You can see long 
rows of these ammonites in every 
museum. 

The largest known is, so to 
speak, a childhood friend of mine. 
“I knew him well,” of course, long 
after its discovery. The enormous 
thing was found in a quarry at a 
place named Seppenrade in West- 
phalia in 1895. Since pachys 
(Greek) means “thick,” it was 
promptly christened Pachydiscus 
seppenradensis. The diameter of 
the shell is 8% feet. The weight 
of the fossil, more precisely a 
steinkern or internal mold, is 
7700 pounds. And the octopus 




Pachydiscus seppenradensis 
Upper Cretaceous, West Germany 

that grew it lived during the 
Upper Cretaceous period. 

I^VEN something as unlikely to 
be gigantic as a jellyfish can 
grow to enormous size. At Na- 
hant. Mass., Prof. Louis Agassiz 
measured one in which the bell 
was 7]/^ feet across and the ten- 
tacles more than 120 feet long! In 
the southern Pacific, one kind 
seems to grow to a diameter 
(without tentacles) of three to 
four feet as a rule. At that size, 
it weighs about 90 pounds. 

A twelve-foot earthworm may 
sound as unlikely as a 90-pound 
jellyfish, but such earthworms 
exist in Australia. They have as 
many as 500 segments and are 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

fairly thin when extended, about 
yi inch. The handbook I con- 
sulted states that the only bird 
known to eat these earthworms is 
the Australian laughing kingfish- 
er. I can add one other — I saw a 
photograph of a domestic duck 
swallowing hard but successfully. 
Yet this is not the longest worm 
by any means. The “broad fish 
tapeworm” will reach a length of 
60 feet, with a width of ^ inches ! 
But a parasite is obviously a spe- 
cial case. 

When it comes to insects, onie 
has to ask, of course, “what 
kind?” The largest living butter- 
fly is a moth and so are the run- 
ners-up. The record is held by the 
South American owl moth with a 
span of 11 inches. The south Asi- 
atic Atlas moth measures 10 
inches in wing-spread, but has 
much wider wings than the owl 
moth. Our North American spe- 
cies do not compare too badly, 
the cecropia moth reaching 7^ 
and the polyphemus moth 6^ 
inches. 

Among the beetles, the elephant 
beetles of South America and the 
goliath beetles of Central Africa 
run in very close competition, 
both being four inches long in 
good specimens. The hercules 
beetles of tropical America meas- 
ure up to 61/^ inches in length, but 
much of this is just tlie long 
projecting horn. In actual length, 
a “walking stick” from Borneo 




Central African Goliath Beetle 
(Goliathus regius) 

probably wins with 1 1 inches, but 
it is quite thin. 

How about the insects of the 
past? In the far remote past, the 
Carboniferous period, insects like 
dragonflies were the largest. The 
biggest present-day dragonflies, 
from tropical America and Bor- 
neo, span between 61^ and 7 
inches maximum. Titanophasma, 
from the Carboniferous of Europe, 
had a wing-span of 18 inches. For 
quite some time, it was thought 
to be the largest, but then Proto- 
donata with a 2^-foot spread 
was found in the Permian of 
Kansas.

C rustaceans and, in gen- 
eral, arthropods still have to 
be mentioned. When the New 
England coast was first reached, 
stories of lobsters of incredible 
size went back to Europe. One 
famous natural history book of 
the sixteenth century, by the 
municipal physician of Zurich, 
Dr. Konrad Gesner, even con- 
tains a picture of a 6-foot lobster 
eating a man. Gesner stated that 
this is what he had been told, 
but neither he nor his artist had 
seen a lobster of such size. 

The fact is that the American 
lobster runs larger than the 
European lobster and that old 
specimens reach considerable size. 
The largest really established 
measured 23^4 inches and weighed 
34 pounds. 

In sheer size, a spider crab 
from the Japan Sea, Macrau- 
cheira kaempfferi, surpasses this 
lobster, since it stilts along over 
the ocean floor on legs spanning 
six feet. Its body, though, is not 
much larger than a fist. 

The largest arthropod known 
became extinct some 450 million 
years ago. It thrived during the 
Silurian period and is known to 
science as Pterygotus. The overall 
length was nine feet; it belonged 
to a completely extinct group 
called the eurypterids. We don’t 
know whether they lived in fresh 
water or salt water. But they were 
obviously carnivorous and the

terror of anything smaller that 
happened to come within reach. 

And there you have a con- 
densed record of the giants of the 
past and present. Incidentally, 
Man rightfully belongs on this 
list. Despite those who insist on 
viewing him as small and puny, 
he actually is a member in good 
standing of the one per cent or 
less of the Earth’s total life popu- 
lation that can be called giants! 
Figure it out for yourself — he 
averages 514 feet in height and 
130 pounds (extremes are 8^ 
feet and 600 pounds) with an 
arm-spread of 5 to 8 feet. What’s 
small about that? 

I’m sorry that this survey 
squeezed out the letter section 
this month. It will be back in 
next month’s department — ^which 
will be astronomical all the way 
through because of the close ap- 
proach of Mars at the end of 
June.

Seeing things? Don't go to an

if it doesn't find you first! 



W ELL, there was this 
song a few years back. 
You know the one. Phil 
Harris singing about a thing that 
you couldn’t get rid of, no matter 
what you did, a thing so repul- 



sive it made you a social outcast. 

Never thought I’d one, 

though. Dirty Pete found it. 

Don’t rush me. I’ll tell you 
about it. 

We’re hobos, understand? Now 



SEE? 



113 




a hobo is a different breed of cat 
than you think. Oh, people are 
getting educated to the idea that 
a hobo will work and move on, 
whereas a tramp will mooch and 
move on, and a bum will mooch 
and hang around, but you still 
find folks who are ignorant 
enough to call us bums. 

We’re aristocrats, yes sir. If 
it wasn’t for us, you wouldn’t 
enjoy half the little luxuries you 
do. Oh, don’t believe me — talk to 
your experts. They know that, 
without the migratory worker, 
most of the crops wouldn’t get 
harvested. And, if I talk high- 
falutin’ once in a while, don’t 
blame me. Associating with the 
Professor improves any man’s 
vocabulary, in spite of them- 
selves. 

^HERE was the four of us, 
* see? We’d been kicking 
around together for longer than 
I care to think about. There was 
the Professor and Dirty Pete and 
Sacks and Ekidie. I’m Eddie. 
Nicknames are funny things. 
Take the Professor — he was a 
real professor once, until he be- 
gan hitting the bottle. Well, he 
lost his job, his home, his family, 
and his rep. 

One morning, he wakes up on 
Skid Row without a nickel in his 
jeans and the great-granddaddy 
of all hangovers. He comes to a 
decision. Either he could make 



a man out of hisself, or he could 
die. Right then, dying looked like 
the easiest thing to do, but it 
took more guts that he had to 
jump off a bridge, so he went on 
the Road instead. 

After he got over his shakes 
— and he sure had ’em bad — he 
decided that, if he never took 
another drink, it’d be the best 
thing for him. So he didn’t. He 
had a kind of dignity, though, 
and he could really talk, so he 
and I teamed up during the wheat 
harvest in South Dakota. We 
made all the stops and, when 
we hit the peaches in California 
we picked up Sacks and Dirty 
Pete. 

Sacks got his monicker because 
he never wore shoes. He claimed 
that gunny-sacks, wrapped 
around his feet and shins, gave 
as much protection and more 
freedom, and they were more 
comfortable, besides costing nix. 
Since we mostly bought our shoes 
at the dumps, at four bits a pair, 
you might say he was stretching 
a point, but that’s one of the 
laws of the Road. You don’t step 
on the other guy’s corns, and he 
don’t step on yours. 

So guess why Dirty Pete was 
called that. Yeah. He hadn’t 
taken a bath since ’forty-six, 
when he got out of the army, and 
he didn’t figger on ever takin’ 
another. He was a damn’ good 
worker, though, and nobody’d 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ever try anything with him 
around. He wasn’t any bigger 
than a Mack truck. Besides, he 
was quiet. 

Oh, sure. You wanna know 
why I’m on the Road. Well, it 
happens I like whiskers. Trouble 
is, they’re not fashionable, unless 
you’re some kind of an artist, 
which I’m not. You know, social 
disapproval. I didn’t have the 
guts to face it, so I lit out. No- 
body cares on the Road what 
you do, so I was okay with my 
belt-length beard. 

A beard’s an enjoyable thing, 
too. There’s a certain kind of 
thrill you get from stroking it, 
and feeling its silkiness run 
through your fingers. And be- 
sides, combing it, and keeping it 
free of burrs, snarls and tangles, 
sort of keeps your spare moments 
so full that the devil don’t find 
any idle time to put your hands 
to work in. If you ask me, I 
think that the razor has been the 
downfall of society. And I’m will- 
ing to bet I have plenty of com- 
pany with the same opinion. 

Show me a man who doesn’t let 
his beard grow once in a while, 
even if it’s only for a day or so, 
and you’ve shown me a man who 
thinks more of social pressure 
than he does of his own comfort. 
And show me a man who says 
he likes to shave, and you’ve 
shown me a man who is either a 
liar or is asking for punishment. 



rwiHAT’S enough about us. Now 
to get on with the story. You 
know, if the Professor hadn’t been 
around, there would probably 
have been murder done over the 
Thing, or at least our little group 
would’ve split up, ’cause none of 
us had the brains to figure it out. 

Pete’s an expert scrounger. His 
eyes are sharp, and he’s always 
on the lookout for a salable piece 
of goods, even if he can only get 
a nickel for it. One night, we’re 
sitting in a jungle near Sacra- 
mento, trying to figure out whe- 
ther to go north for the grapes, 
or south for the grapes. They’re 
all over California, you know, 
and they pay pretty well. 

Pete, as usual, is out looking, 
and pretty soon he comes back 
into camp with this thing in his 
hand. He handles it like it was 
hot, but he’s pleased he’s found 
it, because he hopes to merchan- 
dise it. So he walks up to me, and 
says, “Hey, Eddie. What’ll you 
gimme for this, huh?’’ 

I say, “Get that to hell away 
from me! I’ll give you a swift 
kick in the pants if you don’t.” 
He looks real surprised. He 
says, “Huh, I thought maybe you 
could use it.” 

I get up on my feet. I say, real 
low and careful, because maybe 
he’s joking, “Look, Pete — you 
oughtta know by this time, I like 
my beard. Now will you go 
away?” 



SEE? 



115 



He mooches off, looking like 
I’d kicked him, and goes over 
to the Professor. I figure maybe 
the Professor could use it, so I 
listen. The Prof looks like he was 
being offered a live rattlesnake. 

“No, thanks, really, Pete. I 
have resolved never to touch it 
again. I hope you don’t mind.” 

Well, for some reason Pete 
don’t look pleased, and he’s real 
unhappy by this time, but he 
tries again. 

“Hey, Sacks, what’ll you gim- 
me for — ” 

He don’t get a chance to finish. 
I’m only listening with half an 
ear, but I’m so surprised I stand 
up like I been stuck with a pin. 
Sacks says, “Whatinell would I 
do with a left shoe? You know I 
don’t use ’em.” 

Pete looks at the thing in his 
hand, and the Prof and I go over 
there. 

The Professor looks at the 
thing real carefully and speaks 
up. “Say, Pete, look at that thing 
and tell me what it is.” 

“Why, it’s a brand new bar of 
soap, of course. I don’t use it, 
but one of you might want to. 
What’s all the beef about?” 

“Soap?” I say. “Why, you poor 
fish, something must have hap- 
pened to your eyes. When you 
offered me that straight razor, I 
thought you’d gone off your nut. 
Now I know it.” 

The Professor interrupts. He 



looks excited. “Wait a minute, 
Eddie. To me that item looks ex- 
actly like a full fifth of Old Har- 
vester, 100 proof. Used to be my 
favorite, before I became an ab- 
stainer. To Pete, it looks like soap. 
To you, it looks like a straight 
razor while, to Sacks, it resembles 
a shoe. Does that give you any 
ideas?” 

“Means we’re all having hal- 
lucinations,” I grunts. 

“Exactly. Pete, was there any- 
thing else in the location where 
you found this thing?” 

“Nothing but some scrap tin.” 
“Show us.” 

S O, the four of us wanders 
across the field and, sure 
enough, there was this silly look- 
ing object lying there. It was 
about eighteen or twenty feet 
across, and two feet thick, and I 
nearly made a fool of myself. I 
almost screamed when I saw six 
straight razors crawling out of 
a hole in its side. 

The Professor whistled. “Grab 
them, boys. We want them.” 
Well, Sacks sacrifices one of his 
sacks, and we rounded up fifteen 
of the useless things. We went 
back to the jungle, where the Prof 
explained it. 

“Look, fellows, suppose you 
were a being from another planet 
that wanted to take over here. 
Suppose, further, that you were 
rather small and relatively de- 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fenseless. To finish the supposi- 
tions, suppose you were a posi- 
tive telepath, with not only the 
ability to read minds, but also the 
ability to create visual and tactile 
hallucinations. How would you 
protect yourself?” 

A light began to dawn, but I 
didn’t say a word about it. 

The Professor continued. “If 
you could do all this, you’d make 
yourself look just as useless as 
possible. To Pete, you’d look like 
a bar of soap, because he never 
uses the stuff. To Sacks, you’d 
look like a shoe, because his dis- 
like for shoes is evident in his 
mind. To Ekldie, who is proud of 
his beard, you’d look like a razor, 
while to me, you’d look like a bot- 
tle of booze, because I dislike its 



effects intensely. In other words, 
you would assume an imposture 
that would assure you’d never be 
picked up, except by someone like 
Pete, who would see in you a 
salable item, even though not a 
usable one. It may be, Pete, that 
you have saved the world.” 

So, that’s the story. We’re all 
still on the Road, of course, but 
now we are the “Commission for 
the Investigation of Extraterres- 
trial Invasion.” Congress named 
us as that, when we got the data 
to them. 

Now, Mr. Mayor, you see our 
problem. Have your citizens seen 
anything around that they don’t 
want? If they have, we want to 
look at it.

NEW WORLD OF THE MIND 
by J. B. Rhine. William Sloane 
Associates, $3.75 

T CAME to this book — my first 
flyer into Rhine’s parapsycho- 
logical work — with enthusiasm 
and high curiosity. I put it down 
bothered, bewildered and de- 
pressed. Bothered by the thin 
evidence on which Dr. Rhine 
bases his claims, bewildered by 
the enormousness of those claims, 
and depressed by what I felt was 
an unnecessary attack on the 
natural sciences for their refusal 
to accept the evidence without 
question. 



The statistical evidence for 
clairvoyance, psychokinesis and 
precognition can be accepted, 
though one can doubt that sta- 
tistical mathematics has reached 
a point of infallibility that makes 
it impossible for the methodology 
to be in error. 

But I think we know far too 
little about the interactions of 
brain, ductless glands, nervous 
system and other somatic ele- 
ments that influence personality 
to permit us to throw the pos- 
sibility of a scientific explanation 
of parapsychology out of the 
window and revert forthwith to 
the ancient mystic dualism that 



118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



presupposes the existence of 
Mind separate from and inde- 
pendent of Brain. This is what 
Dr. Rhine does in his book. 

He argues that, since he cannot 
measure “psi energy” with a volt- 
meter, so to speak, it cannot be a 
property or function of matter- 
energy relations, but rather is a 
proof of the existence of the soul. 
To me, this is an unscientific 
argument. There are many things 
our instruments are incapable of 
measuring. 

Why not consider them spiri- 
tual phenomena, too? 

The book should be read by 
anyone interested in learning 
what actually is known about 
parapsychology, but its conclu- 
sions should be taken with a car- 
load of rock salt. 

A MIRROR FOR OBSERVERS 
by Edgar Pangborn. Doubleday 
& Co., $2.95 

TT’S a pity that this beautiful 
-*• and moving book has to be 
labeled science fiction, for it could 
show a much wider audience what 
is being done in this field — those, 
mainly, who are prejudiced by 
poor S-F films and memories of 
ghastly old stories read in their 
youth. 

Primarily, it is a study in the 
faltering ethics of Man: ethics 
which are fine in principle, but 
too often ignored in practice. Sec- 



ondarily, it is a good story — 
though in many ways more like 
a preliminary sketch of a much 
larger-scope novel than it actu- 
ally is. 

The tale tells of the conflict be- 
tween Observers and Abdicators, 
two groups of Martians living in 
four underground cities on Earth, 
for the soul of mankind. The Ab- 
dicators want Man to destroy 
himself; the Observers want to 
help him find his way to matur- 
ity. Both fail — the Abdicators 
completely, the Observers par- 
tially. The ending of the book is 
thus inconclusive, as it should be 
in any serious imagination of 
mankind’s future. 

Despite the bigness of the 
theme, the story is told in little 
details which make the tragedy 
all the more impressive. It is a 
distinguished job, even though in- 
completely developed. 

TOMORROW’S UNIVERSE, 
edited by H. J. Campbell. Panth- 
er Books, London, England. 
Available from Stephen’s Book 
Service, 45 As for Place, New 
York, N. Y., $2.50 

I^VEN the British are doing 
original anthologies of Ameri- 
can science fiction! A shame that 
this one is not particularly worth- 
while. 

Kris Neville, Chad Oliver and 
T. D. Hamm have entries that 






119 



rate reading; the other five tales 
are all in that portentous, fruity 
style the British seem to like — 
except one by Sprague de Camp, 
which is a passably amusing 
space opus. 

This is not one of science fic- 
tion’s Basic Books. 

SEARCH THE SKY by Fied- 
erik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth. 
Ballantine Books, $2.50 and 35^ 
(paper) 

^^HOUGH not quite up to the 
authors’ previous Space 
Merchants, this new one is a 
colorful and pointed melodrama 
of the decay of Man’s interstellar 
empire. Planetary civilizations 
have become frozen into genetic 
patterns that are leading them to- 
ward race suicide. 

Protagonist Ross sets out from 
Halsey’s Planet to find what has 
happened to certain civilizations 
that have faded out of communi- 
cation. After a variety of adven- 
tures, Ross, with three other 
people whom he has picked up 
during his travels, reaches Earth, 
where he finds a civilization ex- 
actly like that in Kornbluth’s 
“The Marching Morons” (GAL- 
AXY, April 1951). 

Here, however, he also finds 
the solution to the bitter dilemma 
into which the whole of mankind 
has worked itself. I think you’ll 
like it. I did. 



BORN LEADER by J. T. McIn- 
tosh. Doubleday & Co., $2.95 

W HERE Pohl and Kornbluth 
survey the terrifying effects 
of genetic inbreeding, McIntosh 
(ex-M’Intosh) here examines the 
results of social inbreeding. 

There are two small colonies on 
two planets of a sun 14 light- 
years from a dying Earth. One is 
imbued with the principles of co- 
operation and a compulsion never 
to mention, much less use, atomic 
energy. This group develops into 
an idyllic and practically stag- 
nant society. 

The other is militarist. It at- 
tempts to conquer the first. And 
in the ensuing conflict, the prob- 
lem is, of course, which will win? 
The working out of that problem 
gives the reader first-rate enter- 
tainment on one level, and food 
for soul-searching thought on 
another. 

TALES FROM GAVAGAN’S 
BAR by L. Sprague de Camp and 
Fletcher Pratt. Twayne Publish- 
ers, $3.00 

TT may not please the joint au- 
thors too much to hear it said, 
but I will make a private wager 
that this volume will be a lot 
more durable in the race for 
literary immortality than any- 
thing else either of them has 
written. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

These little whisky fantasies 
are completely enchanting — wise, 
mad, fantastic, funny, warmly 
human and often very moving. 

There are 23 items in the book, 
over half of which have never ap- 
peared in any magazine. No mat- 
ter how practical you may be, 
you will delight in these blithely 
improbable vignettes. 

THE LIGHTS IN THE SKY 
ARE STARS by Fredric Brown. 
E. P. Dutton & Co., $3.00 

rl'iHIS never-serialized, first-rate 
novel takes up space flight 
after the Moon, Mars and Venus 
have been reached, but before 
space travel has really been ac- 
cepted by Earth’s populations. It 
tells of the struggle to obtain 
financing for a Jupiter rocket. 

Its one defect — if it is a de- 
fect — is its fast pacing, its spare, 
almost skeletal style. Brown is 
telling a story that, for once in 
science fiction, is concerned more 
with character than with plot; 
and the novel of character almost 
requires rich and subtle develop- 
ment. There is some of this here, 
but it seems to me not quite 
enough. 

But that is a minor cavil, in 
a way. 

Even as it stands, the book 
is richly human, exciting, tragic, 
and, in the long run, inspiringly 
imaginative. 



TODAY'S REVOLUTION IN 
WEATHER by William J. Bax- 
ter. International Economic Re- 
search Bureau, $1.00 

A R E C E N T announcement 
that minimum average win- 
ter temperature levels in the New 
York City area were two degrees 
higher during the past thirty 
years than the previous thirty 
made me feel that I should at 
least call your attention to this 
odd, fact-packed but scientifical- 
ly eccentric book. 

It contains an enormous 
amount of data on recent changes 
in the world’s climate, though so 
scrambled in presentation that it 
is hard to arrive at any conclu- 
sions. 

The Partch drawings are de- 
lightful, the price is low, and 
therefore — despite the book’s 
melodramatic and unscientific ap- 
proach — I think you may find it 
worth looking over if you, too, 
wonder what is happening to the 
weather. 

RIDERS TO THE STARS by 
Curt Siodmak and Robert Smith. 
Ballantine Books, $2.50 and 35(^ 
{paper) 

TTERE’S another about Man’s 
first trip into space, this one 
boiling up with more sheer, un- 
diluted excitement than any other 
I can remember. It’s a noveliza- 



★ ★ * ★ ★ SHELF 



121 



tion (by Smith) of a screenplay 
(by Siodmak) and, though show- 
ing signs of haste in preparation, 
it still packs a terrific wallop. 

The plot deals with the pre- 
liminaries three guinea pig scien- 
tist-pilots go through before 
rocketing beyond the atmosphere 
to find out what is ruining other 
unmanned rockets that try flying 
into much deeper space, and with 
the actual flights themselves. 

The writing is undistinguished, 
the technology sketchy, and the 
characterizations two-dimension- 
al. But the suspense is terrific! 

PLANET OF LIGHT by Ray- 
mond F. Jones. John C. Winston 
Co., $2 

^^HIS sequel to Son of the Stars 
is just about the best of the 
Winston science fiction juveniles. 
Essentially, it is a study of the 
need for greater human under- 
standing of ethical values, though 
at the same time it is a rip-roar- 
ing adventure tale. 

It tells of the experiences of a 
small delegation (one family, 
actually) from Earth to a Con- 
ference of the Galactic Federa- 
tion. 

The problem: are they dele- 
gates or laboratory animals? 
What they really are, in the eyes 
of the Federation leaders, is not 
revealed until the very end. 

It is fine reading for all ages. 



ATTACK FROM ATLANTIS 
by Lester del Rey. John C. Win- 
ston Co., $2 

\ 

T^HOUGH not as meaningful as 

-*■ the Jones story, this tale has 
much the same merits of swift 
pacing, vivid imagination, real 
characters and absence of juvenile 
melodrama. It stands out from 
most of its watery predecessors 
as a believable and well-thought- 
out tale of an undersea civiliza- 
tion. 

The title is misleading, inci- 
dentally. It really should be De- 
fense by Atlantis, since it is 
our submarine that penetrates 
their mile-deep regions. 

BRIEF NOTES . ■ • Gnome Press 
has put three new ones on the 
market. C. L. Moore’s Shambleau 
and Others ($3.00) is a set of 
seven horror fantasies from Weird 
Tales; Nat Schachner’s Space 
Lawyer ($2.75) is space opera 
out of the bottom drawer of the 
pre-adult age of science fiction; 
and Robert E. Howard’s The 
Coming of Conan ($3.00) is 
fourth in a series of “colorful, 
action-filled” books about an 
imaginery prehistoric Hyborean 
civilization. 

Sprague de Camp’s The Tri- 
tonian Ring (Twayne, $2.95) is 
in the Conan tradition in every 
sense of the word, though better 
written.

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The British Book Center’s Fly- 
ini Saucers Have Landed (by 
Leslie and Adamski; $3.50) 
strikes me as being completely 
crackpot — if not actually a hoax. 
Miss it. 

Space Travel by Kenneth W. 
Gatland and Anthony M. Kun- 
esch (Philosophical Library, 
$4.75) looks like an excellent 
though unoriginal summary, on a 
high level of technical compe- 
tence, of knowledge on rocket re- 
search and allied fields. It will be 
of special interest to Americans 
who are interested in British and 



European researches, since the 
authors are British scientists with 
intimate knowledge of the work 
of the members of International 
Astronautic Federation, which has 
members from thirteen countries. 

For specialists, Homer E. 
Newell, Jr., has published High 
Altitude Rocket Research (Aca- 
demic Press, $7.50), said to be 
the first book dealing with upper- 
air research by means of rockets. 
The author is head of the Rocket- 
Sonde Research Branch of the 
Naval Research Laboratory.

T he police counselor leaned 
forward and tapped the 
small nameplate on his 
desk, which said: Val Borgenese. 
“That’s my name,” he said. “Who 
are you?” 

The man across the desk shook 
his head. “I don’t know,” he said 
indistinctly. 

“Sometimes a simple approach 
works,” said the counselor, shov- 
ing aside the nameplate. “But not 
often. We haven’t found any- 
thing that’s effective in more than 
a small percentage of cases.” He 
blinked thoughtfully. “Names are 
difficult. A name is like clothing, 
put on or taken off, recognizable 
but not part of the person — ^the 
first thing forgotten and the last 
remembered.” 

The man with no name said 
nothing. 

“Try pet names,” suggested 
Borgenese. “You don’t have to be 
sure — ^just say the first thing 
you think of. It may be some- 
thing your parents called you 
when you were a child.” 

The man stared vacantly, 
closed his eyes for a moment and 
then opened them and mumbled 
something. 

“What?” asked Borgenese. 
“Putsy,” said the man more 
distinctly. “The only thing I can 
think of is Putsy.” 

The counselor smiled. “That’s 
a pet name, of course, but it 
doesn’t help much. We can’t

trace it, and I don’t think you’d 
want it as a permanent name.” 
He saw the expression on the 
man’s face and added hastily: 
“We haven’t given up, if that’s 
what you’re thinking. But it’s not 
easy to determine your identity. 
The most important source of in- 
formation is your mind, and that 
was at the two year level when 
we found you. The fact that you 
recalled the word Putsy is an in- 
dication.” 

“Fingerprints,” said the man 
vaguely. “Can’t you trace me 
through fingerprints?” 

“That’s another clue,” said the 
counselor. “Not fingerprints, but 
the fact that you thought of 
them.” He jotted something 
down. “I’ll have to check those 
re-education tapes. They may be 
defective by now, we’ve run them 
so many times. Again, it may be 
merely that your mind refused to 
accept the proper information.” 

The man started to protest, but 
Borgenese cut him off. “Finger- 
prints were a fair means of iden- 
tification in the Twentieth 
Century, but this is the Twenty- 
second Century.” 

ri^HE counselor then sat back. 

“You’re confused now. You 
have a lot of information you 
don’t know how to use yet. It 
was given to you fast, and your 
mind hasn’t fully absorbed it and 
put it in order. Sometimes it 



helps if you talk out your prob- 
lems.” 

“I don’t know if I have a prob- 
lem.” The man brushed his hand 
slowly across his eyes. “Where do 
I start?” 

“Let me do it for you,” sug- 
gested Borgenese. “You ask ques- 
tions when you feel like it. It 
may help you.” 

He paused, “You were found 
two weeks ago in the Shelters. 
You know what those are?” 

The man nodded, and Borg- 
enese went on : “Shelter and food 
for anyone who wants or needs 
it. Nothing fancy, of course, but 
no one has to ask or apply; he 
just walks in and there’s a place 
to sleep and periodically food is 
provided. It’s a favorite place to 
put people who’ve been retroed.” 

The man looked up. “Re- 
troed?” 

“Slang,” said Borgenese. “The 
retrogression gun ionizes animal 
tissue, nerve cells particularly. 
Aim it at a man’s legs and the 
nerves in that area are drained of 
energy and his muscles won’t hold 
him up. He falls down. 

“Aim it at his head and give 
him the smallest charge the gun 
is adjustable to, and his most re- 
cent knowledge is subtracted from 
his memory. Give him the full 
charge, and he is swept back to 
a childish or infantile age level. 
The exact age he reaches is de- 
pendent on his physical and men- 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tal condition at the time he’s 
retroed. 

“Theoretically it’s possible to 
kill with the retrogression gun. 
The person can be taken back 
to a stage where there’s not 
enough nervous organization to 
sustain the life process. 

“However, life is tenacious. As 
the lower levels are reached, it 
takes increasing energy to sub- 
tract from anything that’s left. 
Most people who want to get rid 
of someone are satisfied to leave 
the victim somewhere between the 
mental ages of one and four. For 
practical purposes, the man they 
knew is dead— or retroed, as they 
say.” 

“Then that’s what they did to 
me,” said the man. “They re- 
troed me and left me in the 
Shelter. How long was I there?” 

■DORGENESE shrugged. “Who 
” knows? That’s what makes it 
difficult. A day, or two months. 
A child of two or three can feed 
himself, and no record is kept 
since the place is free. Also, it’s 
cleaned automatically.” 

“I know that now that you 
mention it,” said the man. “It’s 
just that it’s hard to remember.” 

“You see how it is,” said the 
counselor. “We can’t check our 
files against a date when someone 
disappeared, because we don’t 
know that date except within 
very broad limits.” He tapped 

FORGET ME NEARLY 



his pen on the desk. “Do you 
object to a question?” 

“Go ahead.” 

“How many people in the Solar 
System?” 

The man thought with quiet 
desperation. “Fourteen to sixteen 
billion.” 

The counselor was pleased. 
“That’s right. You’re beginning 
to use some of the information 
we’ve put back into your mind. 
Earth, Mars and Venus are the 
main population centers. But 
there are also Mercury and the 
satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, 
as well as the asteroids. We can 
check to see where you might 
have come from, but there are 
so many places and people that 
you can imagine the results.” 
“There must be some way,” the 
man said painfully. “Pictures, 
fingerprints, something.” 

“Something,” Borgenese nod- 
ded. “But probably not for quite 
a while. There’s another factor, 
you see. It’s a shock, but you’ve 
got to face it. And the funny 
thing is that you’ll never be bet- 
ter able to than now.” 

He rocked back. “Take the 
average person, full of unsus- 
pected anxiety, eveii the happiest 
and most successful. Expose him 
to the retrogression gun. Tensions 
and frustrations are drained 
away. 

“The structure of an adult is 
still there, but it’s empty, waiting 

127 



to be filled. Meanwhile the life 
of the organism goes on, but it’s 
not the same. Lines on the face 
disappear, the expression alters 
drastically, new cell growth oc- 
curs here and there throughout 
the body. Do you see what that 
means?” 

The man frowned. “I suppose 
no one can recognize me.” 

“That’s right. And it’s not only 
your face that changes. You may 
grow taller, but never shorter. If 
your hair was gray, it may dark- 
en, but not the reverse.” 

“Then I’m younger too?” 

“In a sense, though it’s actually 
not a rejuvenation process at all. 
The extra tension that everyone 
carries with him has been re- 
moved, and the body merely takes 
up the slack. 

“Generally, the apparent age is 
made less. A person of middle 
age or under seems to be three 
to fifteen years younger than be- 
fore. You appear to be about 
twenty-seven, but you may ac- 
tually be nearer forty. You see, 
we don’t even know what age 
group to check. 

“And it’s the same with finger- 
prints. They’ve been altered by 
the retrogression process. Not a 
great deal, but enough to make 
identification impossible.” 

nameless man stared 
around the room — at Val 
Borgenese, perhaps fifty, calm 

i2e 



and pleasant, more of a counselor 
than a policeman — out of the 
window at the skyline, and its 
cleanly defined levels of air traf- 
fic. 

Where was his place in this? 

“I guess it’s no use,” he said 
bleakly. “You’ll never find out 
who I am.” 

The counselor smiled. “I think 
we wfill. Directly, there’s not 
much we can do, but there are 
indirect methods. In the last two 
weeks we’ve exposed you to all 
the organized knowledge that can 
be put on tapes — physics, chem- 
istry, biology, math, astrogation, 
the works. 

“It’s easy to remember what 
you once knew. It isn’t learning; 
it’s actually relearning. One fact 
put in your mind triggers another 
into existence. There’s a limit, of 
course, but usually a person 
comes out of re-education with 
slightly more formal knowledge 
than he had in his prior exist- 
ence.” The counselor opened a 
folder on his desk. “We gave you 
a number of tests. You didn’t 
know the purpose, but I can tell 
you the results.” 

He leafed slowly through the 
sheets. “You may have been an 
entrepreneur of some sort. You 
have an excellent sense of power 
ethics. Additionally, we’ve found 
that you’re physically alert, and 
your reactions are well coor- 
dinated. This indicates you may 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have been an athlete or sports- 
man.” 

Val Borgenese laid down the 
tests. “In talking with you, I’ve 
learned more. The remark you 
made about fingerprints suggests 
you may have been a historian, 
specializing in the Twentieth 
Century. No one else is likely to 
know that there was a time in 
which fingerprints were a valid 
means of identification.” 

“I’m quite a guy, I suppose. 
Businessman, sportsman, histo- 
rian.” The man smiled bitterly. 
“All that . but I still don’t 
know who I am. And you can’t 
help me.” 

“Is it important?” asked the 
counselor softly. “This happens 
to many people, you know, and 
some of them do find out who 
they were, with or without our 
help. But this is not simple am- 
nesia. No one who’s been retroed 
can resume his former identity. 
Of course, if we had tapes of 
the factors which made each 
person what he is . .” He 
shrugged. “But those tapes don’t 
exist. Who knows, really, what 
caused him to develop as he has? 
Most of it isn’t at the conscious 
level. At best, if you should learn 
who you were, you’d have to pick 
up the thread of your former 
activities and acquaintances slow- 
ly and painfully. 

“Maybe it would be better if 
you start from where you are. 



You know as much as you once 
did, and the information is up 
to date, correct and undistorted. 
You’re younger, in a sense — in 
better physical condition, not so 
tense or nervous. Build up from 
that.” 

“But I don’t have a name.” 
“Choose one temporarily. You 
can have it made permanent if 
it suits you.” 

T he man was silent, thinking. 

He looked up, not in de- 
spair, but not accepting all that 
the counselor said either. “What 
name? All I know is yours, and 
those of historical figures.” 
“That’s deliberate. We don’t 
put names on tapes, because the 
effects can be misleading. Every- 
one has thousands of associations, 
and can mistake the name of a 
prominent scientist for his own. 
Names unconsciously arrived at 
are usually no help at all.” 
“What do I do?” the man said. 
“If I don’t know names, how can 
I choose one?” 

“We have a list made up for 
this purpose. Go through it slow- 
ly and consciously. When you 
come to something you like, take 
it. If you chance on one that stirs 
memories, or rather where mem- 
ories ought to be but aren’t, let 
me know. It may be a lead I can 
have traced.” 

The man gazed at the coun- 
selor. His thought processes were 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



129 



fast, but erratic. He could race 
along a chain of reasoning and 
then stumble over a simple fact. 
The counselor ought to know 
what he was talking about — this 
was no isolated occurrence. The 
police had a lot of experience to 
justify the treatment they were 
giving him. Still, he felt they were 
mistaken in ways he couldn’t 
formulate. 

“I’ll have to accept it, I sup- 
pose,’’ he said. “There’s nothing 
I can do to learn who I was.’’ 

The counselor shook his head. 
“Nothing that we can do. The 
clues are in the structure of your 
mind, and you have better access 
to it than we do. Read, think, 
look. Maybe you’ll run across 
your name. We can take it from 
there.” He paused. “That is, if 
you’re determined to go ahead.” 

That .was a strange thing for 
a police counselor to say. 

“Of course I want to know who 
I am,” he said in surprise. “Why 
shouldn’t I?” 

“I’d rather not mention this, 
but you ought to know.” Borg- 
enese shifted uncomfortably. 
“One third of the lost identity 
cases that we solve are self- 
inflicted. In other words, sui- 
cides.” 

TTIS head rumbled with names 
long after he had decided on 
one and put the list away. At- 
tractive names and odd ones — but 



which were significant he couldn’t 
say. There was more to living 
than the knowledge that could 
be put on tapes and played back. 
There was more than choosing a 
name. There was experience, and 
he lacked it. The world of per- 
sonal reactions * for him had 
started two weeks previously; it 
was not enough to help him know 
what he wanted to do. 

He sat down. The room was 
small but comfortable. As long 
as he stayed in retro-therapy, he 
couldn’t expect much freedom. 

He tried to weigh the factors. 
He could take a job and adapt 
himself to some mode of living. 

What kind of a job? 

He had the ordinary skills of 
the society — ^but no outstanding 
technical ability had been discov- 
ered in him. He had the ability 
of an entrepreneur — ^but without 
capital, that outlet was denied 
him. 

His mind and body were empty 
and waiting. In the next few 
months, no matter what he did, 
some of the urge to replace the 
missing sensations would be sat- 
isfied. 

The more he thought about 
that, the more powerfully he felt 
that he had to know who he was. 
Otherwise, proceeding to form 
impressions and opinions might 
result in a sort of betrayal of 
himself. 

Assume the worst, that he was 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a suicide. Maybe he had know- 
ingly and willingly stepped out 
of his former life. A suicide would 
cover himself — would make cer- 
tain that he could never trace 
himself back to his dangerous 
motive for the step. If he lived 
on Earth, he would go to Mars 
or Venus to strip himself of his 
unsatisfactory life. There were 
dozens of precautions anyone 
would take. 

But if it weren’t suicide, then 
who had retroed him and why.^ 
That was a question he couldn’t 
answer now, and didn’t need to. 
When he found out who he was, 
the motivation might be clear; if 
it wasn’t, at least he would have 
a basis on which to investigate 
that. 

If someone else had done it to 
him, deliberately or accidentally, 
that person would have taken 
precautions too. The difference 
was this: as a would-be suicide, 
he could travel freely to wherever 
he wished to start over again; 
while another person would have 
difficulty enticing him to a faroff 
place, or, assuming that the ac- 
tual retrogression had taken place 
elsewhere, wouldn’t find it easy to 
transport an inert and memory- 
less body any distance. 

So, if he weren’t a suicide, 
there was a good chance that 
there were clues in this city. He 
might as well start with that 
idea — it was all he had to go on. 



He was free to stay in retro- 
therapy indefinitely, but with the 
restricted freedom he didn’t want 
to. The first step was to get out. 
He made the decision and felt 
better. He switched on the screen. 

Borgenese looked up. “Hello. 
Have you decided?” 

“I think so.” 

“Good. Let’s have it. It’s bound 
to touch on your former life in 
some way, though perhaps so 
remotely we can’t trace it. At 
least, it’s something.” 

“Luis Obispo.” He spelled it 
out. 

t^HE police counselor looked 
dubious as he wrote the name 
down. “It’s not common, nor un- 
common either. The spelling of 
the first name is a little different, 
but there must be countless 
Obispos scattered over the Sys- 
tem.” 

It was curious. Now he almost 
did think of himself as Luis 
Obispo. He wanted to be that 
person. “Another thing,” he said. 
“Did I have any money when I 
was found?” 

“You’re thinking of leaving? A 
lot of them do.” Val Borgenese 
flipped open the folder again. 
“You did have money, an aver- 
age amount. It won’t set you up 
in business, if that’s what you’re 
thinking.” 

“I wasn’t. How do I get it?” 

“I didn’t think you were.” The 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



131 



counselor made another notation. 
*‘ril have the desk release it — 
you can get it any time. By 
the way, you get the full amount, 
no deductions for anything.” 

The news was welcome, con- 
sidering what he had ahead of 
him. 

Borgenese was still speaking. 
“Whatever you do, keep in touch 
with us. It’ll take time to run 
down this name, and maybe we’ll 
draw a blank. But something sig- 
nificant may show up. If you’re 
serious, and I think you are, it’s 
to your advantage to check back 
every day or so.” 

“I’m serious,” said Luis. “I’ll 
keep in touch.” 

There wasn’t much to pack. 
The clothing he wore had been 
supplied by the police. Ordinary 
enough; it would pass on the 
street without comment. It would 
do until he could afford to get 
better. 

He went down to the desk and 
picked up his money. It was more 
than he’d expected — the average 
man didn’t carry this much in 
his pocket. He wondered about 
it briefly as he signed the receipt 
and walked out of retro-therapy. 
The counselor had said it was an 
average amount, but it wasn’t. 

He stood in the street In the 
dusk trying to orient himself. 

Perhaps the money wasn’t so 
puzzling. An average amount for 
those brought into therapy for 



treatment, perhaps. Borgenese 
had said a high proportion were 
suicides. Such a person would 
want to start over again minus 
fears and frustrations, but not 
completely penniless. If he had 
money he’d want to take it with 
him, though not so much that it 
could be traced, since that would 
defeat the original purpose. 

The pattern was logical — sui- 
cides were those with a fair sum 
of money. This was the fact 
which inclined Borgenese to the 
view he obviously held. 

Luis Obispo stood there un- 
certainty. Did he want to find 
out? His lips thinned — he did. In 
spite of Borgenese, there were 
other ways to account for the 
money he had. One of them was 
this: he was an important man, 
accustomed to handling large 
sums of money. 

He started out. He was in a 
small city of a few hundred thou- 
sand on the extreme southern 
coast of California. In the last 
few days he’d studied maps of it; 
he knew where he was going. 

TJ^HEN he got there, the Shel- 
^ ters were dark. He didn’t 
know what he had expected, but 
it wasn’t this. Reflection showed 
him that he hadn’t thought about 
it clearly. The mere existence of 
Shelters indicated an economic 
level in which few people would 
either want or need to make use 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of that which was provided freely. 

He skirted the area. He’d been 
found in one of the Shelters — 
which one he didn’t know. Per- 
haps he should have checked the 
record before he came here. 

No, this was better. Clues, he 
was convinced, were almost non- 
existent. He had to rely on his 
body and mind; but not in the 
ordinary way. He was particular- 
ly sensitive to impressions he 
had received before; the way he 
had learned things in therapy 
proved that; but if he tried to 
force them, he could be led 
astray. The wisest thing was to 
react naturally, almost without, 
volition. He should be able to 
recognize the Shelter he’d been 
found in without trouble. From 
that, he could work back. 

That was the theory — but it 
wasn’t happening. He circled the 
area, and there was nothing to 
which he responded more than 
vaguely. 

He would have to go closer. 

He crossed the street. The plan 
of the Shelters was simple; an 
area two blocks long and one 
block wide, heavily planted with 
shrubs and small trees. In the 
center was an S-shaped continu- 
ous structure divided into a num- 
ber of small dwelling units. 

Luis walked along one wing 
of the building, turned at the 
corner and turned again. It was 
quite dark. He supposed that was 

FORGET ME NEARLY 



why he wasn’t reacting to any- 
thing. But his senses were sharp- 
er than he realized. There was 
a rustle behind him, and instinc- 
tively he flung himself forward, 
flat on the ground. 

A pink spot appeared, low on 
the wall next to him. It had been 
aimed at his legs. The paint 
crackled faintly and the pink spot 
faded. He rolled away fast. 

A dark body loomed past him 
and dropped where he’d been. 
There was an exclamation of 
surprise when the unknown found 
there was no one there. Luis 
grunted with satisfaction — this 
might be only a stickup, but he 
was getting action faster than 
he’d expected. He reached out 
and took hold of a leg and drew 
the assailant to him. A hard ob- 
ject clipped the side of his head, 
and he grasped that too. 

The shape of the gun was 
familiar. He tore it loose. This 
wasn’t any stickup! Once was 
enough to be retrogressed, and 
he’d had his share. Next time it 
was going to be the other guy. 
Physically, he was more than a 
match for his attacker. He twisted 
his body and pinned the strug- 
gling form to the ground. 

That was what it was — a form. 
A woman, very much so; even in 
the darkness he was conscious 
of her body. 

Now she was trying to get 
loose, and he leaned his weight 

133 



more heavily on her. Her cloth- 
ing was torn — he could feel her 
flesh against his face. He raised 
the gun butt, and then changed 
his mind and instead fumbled for 
a light. It wasn’t easy to find it 
and still keep her pinned. 

“Be quiet or I’ll clip you,” he 
growled. 

She lay still. 

TTE found the light and shone 
it on her face. It was good 
to look at, that face, but it wasn’t 
at all familiar. He had trouble 
keeping his eyes from straying. 



Her dress was torn, and what she 
wore underneath was tom too. 

“Seen enough?” she asked cold- 
ly- 

“Put that way, I haven’t.” He 
couldn’t force his voice to be 
matter-of-fact — it wouldn’t be- 
have. 

She stared angrily at the light 
in her eyes. “I knew you’d be 
back,” she said. “I thought I 
could get you before you got me, 
but you’re too fast.” Her mouth 
trembled. “This time make it 
permanent. I don’t want to be 
tormented again like this.” 




134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He let her go and sat up. He 
was trembling, too, but not for 
the same reason. He turned the 
light away from her eyes. 

' “Ever consider that you could 
be mistaken?” he asked. “You’re 
not the only one it happens to.” 

She lay there blinking at him, 
eyes adjusting to the changed 
light. She fumbled at the torn 
dress, which wouldn’t stay where 
she put it. “You too?” she said 
with a vast lack of surprise. 
“When?” 

“They found me here two 
weeks ago. This is the first time 
I’ve come back.” 

“Patterns,” she said. “There are 
always patterns in what we do.” 
Her attitude toward him had 
changed drastically, he could see 
it in her face. “I’ve been out 
three weeks longer.” She sat up 
and leaned closer. She didn’t 
seem to be thinking about the 
same things that had been on her 
mind only seconds before. 

He stood up and helped her to 
her feet. She was near and showed 
no inclination to move away. This 
was something Borgenese hadn’t 
mentioned, and there was noth- 
ing in his re-education to prepare 
him for this sensation, but he 
liked it. He couldn’t see her very 
well, now that the light was 
turned off, but she was almost 
touching him. 

“We’re in the same situation, I 
guess.” She sighed. “I’m lonely 



and a little afraid. Come into 
my place and we’ll talk.” 

He followed her. She turned 
into a dwelling that from the out- 
side seemed identical to the oth- 
ers. Inside, it wasn’t quite the 
same. He couldn’t say in what 
way it was different, but he didn’t 
think it was the one he’d been 
found in. 

That torn dress bothered him — 
not that he wanted her to pin it 
up. The tapes hadn’t been very 
explicit about the beauties of the 
female body, but he thought he 
knew what they’d left out. 

She was conscious of his gaze 
and smiled. It was not an in- 
vitation, it was a request, and 
he didn’t mind obeying. She slid 
into his arms and kissed him. He 
was glad about the limitations of 
re-education. There were some 
things a man ought to learn for 
himself. 

She looked up at him. “Maybe 
you should tell me your name,” 
she said. “Not that it means 
much in our case.” 

“Luis Obispo,” he said, holding 
her. 

“I had more trouble, I couldn’t 
choose until two days ago.” She 
kissed him again, hard and de- 
liberately. It gave her enough 
time to jerk the gun out of his 
pocket. 

She slammed it against his ribs. 
“Stand back,” she said, and 
meant it. 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



135 



L UIS stared bewilderedly at 
her. She was desirable, more 
than he had imagined and for a 
variety of reasons. Her emotions 
had been real, he was sure of 
that, not feigned for the purpose 
of taking the gun away. But she 
had changed again in a fraction 
of a second. Her face was twisted 
with an effort at self-control. 

“What’s the matter?’’ he asked. 
He tried to make his voice gentle, 
but it wouldn’t come out that 
way. The retrogression process 
had sharpened all his reactions — 
this one too. 

“The name I finally arrived at 
was — Luise Obispo,” she said. 

He started. The same as his, 
except feminine! This was more 
than he’d dared hope for. A clue 
— and this girl, who he suddenly 
realized, without any cynicism 
about “love at first sight,” be- 
cause the tapes hadn’t included 
it, meant something to him. 

“Maybe you’re my wife,” he 
said tentatively. 

“Don’t count on it,” she said 
wearily. “It would have been bet- 
' ter if we were strangers — then it 
wouldn’t matter what we did. 
Now there are too many factors, 
and I can’t choose.” 

“It has to be,” he argued. 
“Look — the same name, and so 
close together in time and place, 
and we were attracted instant- 
ly—” 

“Go away,” she said, and the 



gun didn’t waver. It was not a 
threat that he could ignl)re. He 
left. 

She was wrong in making him 
leave, completely wrong. He 
couldn’t say how he knew, but 
he was certain. But he couldn’t 
prove it, and she wasn’t likely 
to accept his unsubstantiated 
word. 

He leaned weakly against the 
door. It was like that. Retro- 
gression had left him with an 
adult body and sharper receptive- 
ness. And after that followed an 
urge to live fully. He had a lot 
of knowledge, but it didn’t ex- 
tend to this sphere of human 
behavior. 

Inside he could hear her mov- 
ing around faintly, an emotional 
anticlimax. It wasn’t just frus- 
trated sex desire, though that 
played a part. They had known 
each other previously — the in- 
stant attraction they’d had for 
each other was proof, leaving 
aside the names. Lord, he’d trade 
his unknown identity to have her. 
He should have taken another 
name — any other name would 
have been all right. 

It wasn’t because she was the 
first woman he’d seen, or the 
woman he had first re-seen. There 
had been nurses, some of them 
beautiful, and he’d paid no at- 
tention to them. But Luise Obispo 
was part of his former life — and 
he didn’t know what part. The 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



reactions were there, but until he 
could find out why, he was de- 
nied access to the satisfactions. 

From a very narrow angle, and 
only from that angle, he could 
see that there was still a light 
inside. It was dim, and if a per- 
son didn’t know, he might pass 
by and not notice it. 

His former observation about 
the Shelters was incorrect. Every 
dwelling might be occupied and 
he couldn’t tell unless he ex- 
amined them individually. 

He stirred. The woman was a 
clue to his problem, but the clue 
itself was a far more urgent prob- 
lem. Though his identity was im- 
portant, he could build another 
life without it and the new life 
might not be worse than the one 
from which he had been forcibly 
removed. 

Perhaps he was over-reacting, 
but he didn’t think so: his new 
life had to include this woman. 

He wasn’t equipped to handle 
the emotion. He stumbled away 
from the door and found an un- 
occupied dwelling and went in 
without turning on the lights and 
lay down on the bed. 

In the morning, he knew he had 
been here before. In the darkness 
he had chosen unknowingly but 
also unerringly. This was the 
place in which he had been retro- 
gressed. 

It was here that the police had 
picked him up. 

FORGET ME NEARLY 



F^HE counselor looked sleepily 
out of the screen. “I wish you 
people didn’t have so much en- 
ergy,” he complained. Then he 
looked again and the sleepiness 
vanished. “I see you found it the 
first time.” 

Luis knew it himself, because 
there was a difference from the 
dwelling Luise lived in — not 
much, but perceptible to him. 
The counselor, however, must 
have a phenomenal memory to 
distinguish it from hundreds of 
others almost like it. 

Borgenese noticed the expres- 
sion and smiled. “I’m not an 
eidetic, if that’s what you think. 
There’s a number on the set 
you’re calling from and it shows 
on my screen. You can’t see it.” 
They would have something 
like that, Luis thought. “Why 
didn’t you tell me this was it 
before I came?” 

“We were pretty sure you’d 
find it by yourself. People who’ve 
just been retroed usually do. It’s 
better to do it on your own. Our 
object is to have you recover your 
personality. If we knew who you 
were, we could set up a program 
to guide you to it faster. As it is, 
if we help you too much, you turn 
into a carbon copy of the man 
who’s advising you.” 

Luis nodded. Give a man his 
adult body and mind and turn 
him loose on the problems which 
confronted him, and he would 

137 



come up with adult solutions. It 
was better that way. 

But he hadn’t called to discuss 
that. “There’s another person 
living in the Shelters,’’ he said. 
“You found her three weeks be- 
fore you found me.’’ 

“So you’ve met her already? 
Fine. We were hoping you 
would.’’ Borgenese chuckled. 
“Let’s see if I can describe her. 
Apparent age, about twenty- 
three; that means that she was 
originally between twenty-six or 
thirty-eight, with the probability 
at the lower figure. A good body, 
as you are probably well aware, 
and a striking face. Somewhat 
oversexed at the moment, but 
that’s all right — so are you.” 

He saw the expression on Luis’s 
face and added quickly: “You 
needn’t worry. Draw a parallel 
with your own experience. There 
were pretty nurses all around 
you in retro-therapy, and I 
doubt that you noticed that they 
were female. That’s normal for a 
person in your position, and it’s 
the same with her. 

“It works this way: you’re 
both unsure of yourselves and 
can’t react to those who have 
some control over their emotions. 
When you meet each other, you 
can sense that neither has made 
the necessary adjustments, and 
so you are free to release your 
true feelings.” 

He smiled broadly. “At the 



moment, you two are the only 
ones who have been retroed re- 
cently. You won’t have any com- 
petition for six months or so, 
until you begin to feel comfort- 
able in your new life. By then, 
you should know how well you 
really like each other. 

“Of course tomorrow, or even 
today, we might find another 
person in the Shelter. If it’s a 
man, you’ll have to watch out; 
if a woman, you’ll have too much 
companionship. As it is, I think 
you’re very lucky.” 

Yeah, he was lucky — or would 
be if things were actually like 
that. Yesterday he would have 
denied it; but today, he’d be 
willing to settle for it, if he 
could get it. 

“I don’t think you under- 
stand,” he said. “She took the 
same name that I did.” 

Borgenese’s smile flipped over 
fast, and the other side was a 
frown. For a long time he sat 
there scowling out of the screen. 
“That’s a hell of a thing to tell 
me before breakfast,” he said. 
“Are you sure? She couldn’t de- 
cide on a name before she left.” 
“I’m sure,” said Luis, and re- 
lated all the details of last night. 

The counselor sat there and 
didn’t say anything. 

T UIS waited as long as he 
^ could. “You can trace us 
now,” he said. “One person might 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be difficult. But two of us with 
nearly the same name, that 
should stick out big, even in a 
population of sixteen billion. Two 
people are missing from some- 
where. You can find that.” 

The counselor’s face didn’t 
change. “You understand that if 
you were killed, we’d find the 
man who did it. I can’t tell you 
how, but you can be sure he 
wouldn’t escape. In the last hun- 
dred years there’s been no un- 
solved murder.” 

He coughed and turned away 
from the screen. When he turned 
back, his face was calm. “I’m not 
supposed to tell you this much. 
I’m breaking the rule because 
your case and that of the girl is 
different from any I’ve ever han- 
dled.” He was speaking careful- 
ly. “Listen. I’ll tell you once and 
won’t repeat it. If you ever ac- 
cuse me. I’ll deny I said it, and I 
have the entire police organiza- 
tion behind me to make it stick.” 
The counselor closed his eyes 
as if to see in his mind the prin- 
ciple he was formulating. “If we 
can catch a murderer, no matter 
how clever he may be, it ought 
to be easier to trace the identity 
of a person who is still alive. It 
is. But we never try. Though it’s 
all right if the victim does. 

“It I should ask the coopera- 
tion of other police departments, 
they wouldn't help. If the solu- 
tion lies within an area over 

FORGET ME NEARLY 



which I have jurisdiction and I 
find out who is responsible, I will 
be dismissed before I can prose- 
cute the man." 

Luis stared at the counselor in 
helpless amazement. “Then 
you’re not doing anything,” he 
said shakily. “You lied to me. 
You don’t intend to do any- 
thing.” 

“You’re overwrought,” said 
Borgenese politely. “If you could 
see how busy we are in your be- 
half — ” He sighed. “My advice is 
that if you can’t convince the 
girl, forget her. If the situation 
gets emotionally unbearable, let 
me know and I can arrange trans- 
portation to another city where 
there may be others who are — 
uh — more compatible.” 

“But she’s my wife,” he said 
stubbornly. 

“Are you sure?” 

Actually Luis wasn’t — ^but he 
wanted her to be, or any varia- 
tion thereof she would consent to. 
He explained. 

“As she says, there are a lot of 
factors,” commented the coun- 
selor. “I’d suggest an examina- 
tion. It may remove some of her 
objections.” 

He hadn’t thought of it, but 
he accepted it eagerly. “What will 
that do?” 

“Not much, unfortunately. It 
will prove that you two can have 
healthy normal children, but it 
won’t indicate that you’re not a 

139 



member of her genetic family. 
And, of course, it won’t touch on 
the question of legal family, 
brother-in-law and the like. I 
don’t suppose she’d accept that.” 

She wouldn’t. He’d seen her 
for only a brief time and yet he 
knew that much. He was in an 
ambiguous position; he could 
make snap decisions he was cer- 
tain were right, but he had to 
guess at facts. He and the girl 
were victims, and the police re- 
fused to help them in the only 
way that would do much good. 
And the police had, or thought 
they had, official reasons for 
their stand. 

Luis told the counselor just 
exactly what he thought of that. 

“It’s too bad,” agreed the 
counselor. “These things often 
have an extraordinary degree of 
permanency if they ever get 
started.” 

If they ever -got started! Luis 
reached out and turned off the 
screen. It flickered unsteadily — 
the counselor was trying to call 
him back. He didn’t want to talk 
to the man; it was painful, and 
Borgenese had nothing to add but 
platitudes, and fuel to his anger. 
He swung open the panel and 
jerked the wiring loose and the 
screen went blank. 

There was an object concealed 
in the mechanism he had exposed. 
It was a neat, vicious, little retro- 
gression gun. 



H e got it out and balanced it 
gingerly in his hand. Now he 
had something else to work on! 
It was the weapon, of course. It 
had been used on him and then 
hidden behind the screen. 

It was a good place to hide it. 
The screens never wore out or 
needed adjustment, and the 
cleaning robots that came out of 
the wall never cleaned there. The 
police should have found it, but 
they hadn’t looked. He smiled 
bitterly. They weren’t interested 
in solving crimes — merely in 
ameliorating the consequences. 

Though the police had failed, 
he hadn’t. It could be traced 
back to the man who owned it, 
and that person would have in- 
formation. He turned the retro 
gun over slowly; it was just a 
gun; there were countless others 
like it. 

He finished dressing and drop- 
ped the gun in his pocket. He 
went outside and looked across 
the court. He hesitated and then 
walked over and knocked. 

“Occupied,” said the door. 
“But the occupant is out. No def- 
inite time of return stated, but 
she will be back this evening. Is 
there any message?” 

“No message,” he said. “I’ll 
call back when she’s home.” 

He hoped she wouldn’t refuse 
to speak to him. She’d been away 
from retro-therapy longer than 
he and possibly had developed 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



her own leads — very likely she 
was investigating some of them 
now. Whatever she found would 
help him, and vice versa. The 
man who’d retroed her had done 
the same to him. They were ap- 
proaching the problem from dif- 
ferent angles. Between the two of 
them, they should come up with 
the correct solution. 

He walked away from the 
Shelters and caught the belt to 
the center of town; the journey 
didn’t take long. He stepped off, 
and wandered in the bright sun- 
shine, not quite aimlessly. At 
length he found an Electronic 
Arms store, and went inside. 

A ROBOT came to wait on 
him. “I’d like to speak to 
the manager,’’ he said and the 
robot went away. 

Pr( sently the manager appear- 
ed, middle aged, drowsy. “What 
can I do for you?’’ 

Luis laid the retrogression gun 
on the counter. “I’d like to know 
who this was sold to.’’ 

The manager coughed. “Well, 
there are millions of them, hun- 
dreds of millions.’’ 

“I know, but I have to find 
out.’’ 

The manager picked it up. 
“It’s a competitor’s make,” he 
said doubtfully. “Of course, as a 
courtesy to a customer . .” He 
fingered it thoughtfully. “Do you 
really want to know? It’s just a 

FORGET ME NEARLY 



freezer. Not at all dangerous.” 

Luis looked at it with concern. 
Just a freezer — not a retro gun 
at all ! Then it couldn’t have been 
the weapon used on him. 

Before he could take it back 
the manager broke it open. The 
drowsy expression vanished. 

“Why didn’t you say so?” ex- 
claimed the manager, examining 
it. “This gun has been illegally 
altered.” He bent over the ex- 
posed circuits and then glanced 
up happily at Luis. “Come here. 
I’ll show you.” 

Luis followed him to the small 
workshop in the back of the 
store. The manager closed the 
door behind them and fumbled 
among the equipment. He mount- 
ed the gun securely in a frame 
and pressed a button which pro- 
jected an image of the circuit 
onto a screen. 

The manager was enjoying 
himself. “Everybody’s entitled to 
self-protection,” he said. “That’s 
why we sell so many like these. 
They’re harmless, won’t hurt a 
baby. Fully charged, they’ll put 
a man out for half an hour, over- 
load his nervous system. At the 
weakest, they’ll still keep him out 
of action for ten minutes. Below 
that, they won’t work at all.” He 
looked up. “Are you sure you 
understand this?” 

It had been included in his 
re-education, but it didn’t come 
readily to his mind. “Perhaps 

141 



you’d better go over it for me.” 
The manager wagged his head. 
“As I said, the freezer is legal, 
won’t harm anyone. It’ll stop a 
man or an elephant in his tracks, 
freeze him, but beyond that will 
leave him intact. When he comes 
out of it, he’s just the same as 
before, nothing changed.” He 
seized a pointer and adjusted 
the controls so as to enlarge the 
image on the screen. “However, 
a freezer can be converted to a 
retrogression gun, and that’s il- 
legal.” He traced the connections 
with the pointer. “If this wire, 
instead of connecting as it does, 
is moved to here and here, the 
polarity is reversed. In addition, 
if these four wires are inter- 
changed, the freezer becomes a 
retrogressor. As I said, it’s illegal 
to do that.” 

^^HE manager scrutinized the 
circuits closely and grunted 
in disgust. “Whoever converted 
this did a sloppy job. Here.” He 
bent over the gun and began ma- 
nipulating micro-instruments. He 
worked rapidly and surely. A mo- 
ment later, he snapped the weap- 
on together and straightened up, 
handing it to Luis. “There,” he 
said proudly. “It’s a much more 
effective retrogressor than it was. 
Uses less power too.” 

Luis swallowed. Either he was 
mad or the man was, or perhaps 
it was the society he was trying 



to adjust to. “Aren’t you taking 
a chance, doing this for me?” 

The manager smiled. “You’re 
joking. A tenth of the freezers we 
sell are immediately converted 
into retrogressors. Who cares?” 
He became serious. “Do you still 
want to know who bought it?” 
Luis nodded — at the moment 
he didn’t trust his voice. 

“It will take several hours. No 
charge though, customer service. 
Tell me where I can reach you.” 
Luis jotted down the number of 
the screen at the Shelter and 
handed it to the manager. As he 
left, the manager whispered to 
him: “Remember, the next time 
you buy a freezer — ours can be 
converted easier than the one 
you have.” 

He went out into the sunlight. 
It didn’t seem the same. What 
kind of society was he living in? 
The reality didn’t fit with what 
he had re-learned. It had seemed 
an orderly and sane civilization, 
with little violence and vast re- 
spect for the law. 

But the fact was that any 
school child — well, not quite that 
young, perhaps — but anyone old- 
er could and did buy a freezer. 
And it was ridiculously easy to 
convert a freezer into something 
far more vicious. Of course, it 
was illegal, but no one paid any 
attention to that. 

This was wrong; it wasn’t the 
way he remembered . 



T42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He corrected himself : he didn’t 
actually remember anything. His 
knowledge came from tapes, and 
was obviously inadequate. Cer- 
tain things he just didn’t under- 
stand yet. 

He wanted to talk to someone 
— but who? The counselor had 



Before what? Before he had 
been retrogressed. He had beeh 
brought here from elsewhere, the 
same as Luise. 

He visited the spaceport. Again 
the evidence was negative; there 
was not a ship the sight of which 
tripped his memory. It had been 




given him all the information he 
intended to. The store manager 
had supplied some additional in- 
sight, but it only confused him. 
Luise — at the moment she was 
suspicious of him. 

There was nothing to do except 
to be as observant as he could. 
He wandered through the town, 
just looking. He saw nothing that 
seemed fam’iliar. Negative evi- 
dence, of course, but it indicated 
he hadn’t lived here before. 

FORGET ME NEARLY 



too much to hope for; if he had 
been brought in by spaceship, it 
wouldn’t still be around for him 
to recognize. 

Late in the afternoon, he head- 
ed toward the center of town. He 
was riding the belt when he saw 
Luise coming out of a tall office 
building. 

TTE hopped off and let her 
pass, boarding it again and 
following her at a distance. As 



143 



soon as they were out of the busi- 
ness district, he began to edge 
closer. 

A few blocks from the Shelter 
she got off the belt and waited, 
turning around and smiling di- 
rectly at him. In the interim her 
attitude toward him had changed, 
evidently — ^for the better, as far 
as he was concerned. He couldn’t 
ignore her and didn’t want to. He 
stepped off the belt. 

“Hello,” she said. “I think you 
were following me.” 

“I was. Do you mind?” 

“I guess I don’t.” She walked 
along with him. “Others followed 
me, but I discouraged them.” 
She was worth following, but it 
was not that which was strange. 
Now she seemed composed and 
extraordinarily friendly, a com- 
plete reversal from last night. 
Had she learned something dur- 
ing the day which changed her 
opinion of him? He hoped she 
had. 

She stopped at the edge of the 
Shelter area. “Do you live here?” 
Learned something? She seem- 
ed to have forgotten. 

He nodded. 

“For the same reason?” 

His throat tightened. He had 
told her all that last night. 
Couldn’t she remember? 

“Yes,” he said. 

“I thought so. That’s why I 
didn’t mind your following me.” 
Here was the attraction factor 



that Borgenese had spoken of; it 
was functioning again, for which 
he was grateful. But still, why? 
And why didn't she remember 
last night? 

They walked on until she came 
to her dwelling. She paused at 
the door. “I have a feeling I 
should know who you are, but 
I just can’t recall. Isn’t that ter- 
rible?” 

It was — frightening. Her iden- 
tity was apparently incompletely 
established; it kept slipping back- 
ward to a time she hadn’t met 
him. He couldn’t build an3rthing 
enduring on that; each meeting 
with her would begin as if noth- 
ing had happened before. 

Would the same be true of 
him? 

He looked at her. The torn 
dress hadn’t been repaired, as 
he’d thought at first; it had been 
replaced by the robots that came 
out of the wall at night. They’d 
done a good job fitting her, but 
with her body that was easy. 

It was frightening and it wasn’t. 
At least this time he didn’t have 
a handicap. He opened his mouth 
to tell her his name, and then 
closed it. He wasn’t going to 
make that mistake again. “I 
haven’t decided on a name,” he 
said. 

“It was that way with me too.” 
She gazed at him and he could 
feel his insides sloshing around. 
“Well, man with no name, do you 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



want to come in? We can have 
dinner together.” 

He entered. But dinner was 
late that night. He had known it 
would be. 

TN the morning light, he sat up 
-*■ and put his hand on her. She 
smiled in her sleep and squirmed 
closer. There were compensations 
for being nobody, he supposed, 
and this was one of them. He got 
up quietly and dressed without 
waking her. There were a number 
of things he wanted to discuss, 
but somehow there hadn’t been 
time last night. He would have to 
talk to her later today. 

He slipped out of the house 
and went across the court into 
his own. The screen he had rip- 
ped apart had been repaired and 
put back in place. A voice chimed 
out as he entered: “A call came 
while you were gone.” 

“Let’s have it.” 

The voice descended the scale 
and became that of the store 
manager. “The gun you brought 
in was sold six months ago to 
Dorn Starret, resident of Ceres 
and proprietor of a small gallium 
mine there. That’s all the infor- 
mation on record. I trust it will 
be satisfactory.” 

Luis sat down. It was. He could 
trace the man or have him traced, 
though the last might not be 
necessary. 

The name meant something to 



him — just what he couldn’t say. 
Dorn Starret, owner of a gallium 
mine on Ceres. The mine might 
or might not be, of consequence; 
gallium was used in a number of 
industrial processes, but beyond 
that was not particularly valu- 
able. 

He closed his eyes to concen- 
trate. The name slid into vacant 
nerve cells that were responsive; 
slowly a picture formed, nebulous 
and incomplete at first. There 
was a mouth and then there were 
eyes, each feature bringing others 
into focus, unfolding as a germ 
cell divides and grows, calling 
into existence an entire creature. 
The picture was nearly complete. 

Still with eyes closed, he look- 
ed at the man he remembered. 
Dorn Starret, five-eleven, one 
hundred and ninety, flesh that 
had once been muscular and firm. 
Age, thirty-seven; black hair that 
was beginning to recede from his 
forehead. The face was harder to 
define — strong, though slightly 
hard, it was perhaps good look- 
ing. It was the eyes which were 
at fault, Luis decided — glinting 
often — and there were lines on 
the face that ought not to be 
there. 

There was another thing that 
set the man apart. Not clothing; 
that was conventional, though 
better than average. Luis stared 
into his memory until he was 
able to see it. Unquestionably the 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



145 



man was left-handed. The pic- 
ture was too clear to permit a 
mistake on that detail. 

He knew the man, had seen 
him often. How and in what con- 
text? He waited, but nothing else 
came. 

Luis opened his eyes. He would 
recognize the man if he ever saw 
him. This was the man who own- 
ed the gun, presumably had shot 
him with it, and then had hidden 
it here in this room. 

He thought about it vainly. By 
itself, the name couldn’t take 
him back through all past associ- 
ations with the man, so he passed 
from the man to Ceres. Here he 
was better equipped; re-educa- 
tion tapes had replaced his for- 
mer knowledge of the subject. 

^T^HE asteroid belt was not 
rigidly policed; if there was a 
place in the System in which 
legal niceties were not strictly 
observed, it was there. What 
could he deduce from that? Noth- 
ing perhaps; there were many 
people living in the belt who were 
engaged in legitimate work : 
miners, prospectors, scientific in- 
vestigators. But with rising ex- 
citement, he realized that Dorn 
Starret was not one of these. 

He was a criminal. The gal- 
lium mine was merely an attempt 
to cover himself with respect- 
ability. How did Luis know that? 
He wasn’t sure; his thought pro- 



cesses were hidden and erratic; 
but he knew. 

Dorn Starret was a criminal — 
but the information wasn’t com- 
pletely satisfactory. What had 
caused the man to retrogress 
Luis and Luise Obispo? That 
still had to be determined. 

But it did suggest this: as a 
habitual criminal, the man was 
more than ordinarily dangerous. 

Luis sat there a while longer, 
but he had recalled everything 
that would come out of the origi- 
nal stimulus. If he wanted more, 
he would have to dig up other 
facts or make further contacts. 
But at least it wasn’t hopeless — 
even without the police, he had 
learned this much. 

He went over the room thor- 
oughly once more. If there was 
anything hidden, he couldn’t find 
it. 

He crossed the court to Luise’s 
dwelling. She was gone, but there 
was a note on the table. He pick- 
ed it up and read it: 

Dear man with no name: 

I suppose you were here last 
night, though I’m so mixed up I 
can’t be sure; there’s so little of 
memory or reality to base any- 
thing on. I wanted to talk to you 
before I left but I guess, like me, 
you’re out investigating. 

There’s always a danger that 
neither of us will like what we 
find. What if I’m married to an- 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



other person and the same with 
you? Suppose . but there are 
countless suppositions — these are 
the risks we take. It’s intolerable 
not to know who I am, especially 
since the knowledge is so close. 
But of course you know that. 

Anyway I’ll be out most of the 
day. I discovered a psychologist 
who specializes in restoring mem- 
ory; you can see the possibilities 
in that. I went there yesterday 
and have an appointment again 
today. It’s nice of him, consider- 
ing that I have no money, but he 
says I’m more or less an experi- 
mental subject. I can’t tell you 
when I’ll be back but it won’t be 
late. 

Luise. 

He crumpled the note in his 
hand. Memory expert. Her psy- 
chologist was that — in reverse. 
Yesterday he had taken a day out 
of her life, and that was why 
Luise hadn’t recognized him and 
might not a second time. 

TTE leaned against the table. 
-■■■*• After a moment, he straight- 
ened out the note. A second read- 
ing didn’t help. There it was, if 
he could make sense from it. 

Luise and himself, probably in 
that order. There was no proof, 
but it seemed likely that she had 
been retrogressed first, since she 
had been discovered first. 

There was also Dorn Starret, 



the criminal from Ceres who had 
hidden the gun in the Shelter 
that he, Luis, had been found in. 
And there was now a fourth per- 
son: the psychologist who spe- 
cialized in depriving retrogression 
victims of what few memories 
they had left. 

Luis grimaced. Here was in- 
formation which, if the police 
would act on it properly . but 
it was no use, they wouldn’t. Any 
solution which came out of this 
would have to arise out of his 
own efforts. 

He folded the note carefully. It 
would be handy to have if Luise 
came back and didn’t know who 
he was. 

Meanwhile, the psychologist. 
Luise hadn’t said who he was, but 
it shouldn’t be difficult to locate 
him. He went to the screen and 
dialed the directory. There were 
many psychologists in it, but no 
name that was familiar. 

He pondered. The person who 
had retroed Luise and himself — 
what would he do? First he would 
take them as far from familiar 
scenes as he could. That tied in 
with the facts. Dorn Starret came 
from Ceres. 

Then what? He would want to 
make certain that his victims did 
not trace their former lives. And 
he would be inconspicuous in so 
doing. 

Again Luis turned to the 
screen, but this time he dialed 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



147 



the news service. He found what 
he was looking for in the adver- 
tisements of an issue a month 
old. It was very neat: 

DO YOU REMEMBER 
EVERYTHING — or is 
your mind hazy? Perhaps 
my system can help you 
recall those little details 
you find it so annoying to 
forget. MEMORY LAB. 

That was all. No name. But 
there was an address. Hurriedly 
Luis scanned every succeeding 
issue. The advertisement was still 
there. 

He was coming closer, very 
close. The ad was clever; it would 
attract the attention of Luise and 
himself and others like them, and 
almost no one else. There was no 
mention of fees, no claim that it 
was operated by a psychologist, 
nothing that the police would in- 
vestigate. 

Night after night Luise had 
sat alone; sooner or later, watch- 
ing the screen, she had to see the 
ad. It was intriguing and she had 
answered it. Normally, so would 
he have: but now he was fore- 
warned. 

Part of the cleverness was this : 
that she went of her own voli- 
tion. She would have suspected 
an outright offer of help — but this 
seemed harmless. She went to 
him as she would to anyone in 



business. A very clever setup. 

But who was behind MEM- 
ORY LAB? Luis thought he 
knew. A trained psychologist 
with a legitimate purpose would 
attach his name to the advertise- 
ment. ■ 

Luis patted the retro gun in 
his pocket. Dorn Starret, crimi- 
nal, and inventor of a fictitious 
memory system, was going to 
have a visitor. It wasn’t necessary 
to go to Ceres to see him. 

¥T was the only conclusion that 
made sense. Dorn Starret had 
retroed him — the gtin proved 
that — and Luise as well. Until a 
few minutes ago, he had thought 
that she had been first and he 
later, but that was wrong. They 
had been retrogressed together 
and Dorn Starret had done it: 
now he had come back to make 
certain that they didn’t trace 
him. 

Neat — but it wasn’t going to 
work. Luis grinned wryly to him- 
self. He had a weapon in his 
pocket that was assurance it 
wouldn’t work. 

He got off the belt near the 
building he had seen Luise leav- 
ing yesterday. He went into the 
lobby and located MEMORY 
LAB. a suite on the top floor. It 
wasn’t necessary, but he checked 
rental dates. The lab had been 
there exactly three weeks. This 
tied in with Luise’s release from 



148 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



retro-therapy. Every connection 
he had anticipated was there. 

He rode up to the top floor. 
There wasn’t a chance that Star- 
ret would recognize him; physi- 
cally he must have changed too 
much since the criminal had last 
seen him. And while Luise hadn’t 
concealed that she was a retro 
and so had given herself away, 
he wasn’t going to make that 
mistake. 

The sign on the door stood out 
as he came near and disappeared 
as he went by. MEMORY LAB, 
that was all — no other name, even 
here. Naturally. A false name 
would be occasion for police ac- 
tion. The right one would evoke 
Luise’s and his own memories. 

He turned back and went into 
the waiting room. No robot re- 
ceptionist. He expected that; the 
man didn’t intend to be around 
very long. 

“Who’s there?” The voice came 
from a speaker in the wall; the 
screen beside it remained blank, 
though obviously the man was 
in the next room. For a commer- 
cial establishment, the LAB was 
not considerate of potential cli- 
ents. 

Luis smiled sourly and loosen- 
ed the weapon in his pocket. “I 
saw your advertisement,” he said. 
No name; let him guess. 

“I’m very busy. Can you come 
back tomorrow?” 

Luis frowned. This was not ac- 



cording to plan. First, he didn’t 
recognize the voice, though the 
speaker could account for that if 
it were intentionally distorted. 
Second, Luise was inside and he 
had to protect her. He could 
break in, but he preferred that 
the man come out. 

He thought swiftly. “I’m Chals 
Putsyn, gallium importer,” he 
called. “Tomorrow I’ll be away 
on business. Can you give me an 
appointment for another time?” 

There was- a long silence. 
“Wait. I’ll be out.” 

He’d thought the mention of 
gallium would do it. True, the 
mine Starret owned was prob- 
ably worthless, but he couldn’t 
restrain his curiosity. 

^^HE door swung open and a 
man stepped out, closing the 
door before Luis could see in- 
side. 

He had erred — the man was 
not Dorn Starret. 

The other eyed him keenly. 
“Mr. Chals Putsyn? Please sit 
down.” 

Luis did so slowly, giving him- 
self time to complete a mental in- 
ventory. The man had to be Dorn 
Starret — and yet he wasn’t. No 
disguise could be that effective. 
At least three inches shorter; the 
shape of his head was different; 
his body was slighter. Moreover, 
he was right-handed, not left, as 
Starret was. 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



149 



Luis had a story ready — names, 
dates, and circumstances. It 
sounded authentic even to him- 
self. 

The man listened impatiently. 
“I may not be able to help you,” 
he said, interrupting. “Oddly 
enough, light cases are hardest. 
It’s the serious memory blocks 
that I specialize in.” There was 
something strange about his eyes 
— his voice too. “However, if you 
can come back in two days, late 
in the afternoon. I’ll see what I 
can do.” 

Luis took the appointment 
card and found himself firmly 
ushered to the door. It was dis- 
turbing; Luise was in the next 
room, but the man gave him no 
opportunity to see her. 

He stood uncertainly in the 
hall. The whole interview had 
taken only a few minutes, and 
during that time all his previous 
ideas had been upset. If the man 
was not Dorn Starret, who was 
he and what was his connection? 
The criminal from Ceres was not 
so foolish as to attempt to solve 
his problems by assigning them 
to another person. This was a 
one-man job from beginning to 
end, or ought to be. 

Luis took the elevator to the 
ground floor and walked out aim- 
lessly on the street. There was 
something queer about the man 
on the top floor. It took time to 
discover what it was. 



The man was not Starret — but 
he was disguised. His irises were 
stained another color and the 
voice was not his own — or rather 
it was, but filtered through an 
artificial larynx inserted painful- 
ly in his throat. And his face had 
been recently swabbed with a 
chemical irritant which caused 
the tissues beneath his skin to 
swell, making his face appear 
plumper. 

Luis took a deep breath. Un- 
consciously he had noticed de- 
tails too slight for the average 
person to discern. This suggested 
something about his own past — 
that he was trained to recognize 
disguises. 

But more important was this: 
that the man was disguised at all. 
The reason was obvious — to 
avoid evoking memories. 

The man’s name — ^what was 
it? It hadn’t even been registered 
in the building — he’d asked on 
his way out. And Luise couldn’t 
tell him. She was no longer a re- 
liable source of information. He 
had to find out, and there was 
only one way that suggested it- 
self. 

Luise was still in there, but not 
in physical danger. The police 
were lax about other things, but 
not about murder, and the man 
knew that. She might lose her 
memories of the past few weeks; 
regrettable if it happened, but not 
a catastrophe.

But who was the man and 
what was his connection? 

He spent the rest of the day 
buying equipment — not much, 
but his money dwindled rapidly. 
He considered going back to the 
Shelter and then decided against 
it. By this time Luise would be 
back, and he would be tempted 
not to leave her. 

After dark, when the lights in 
the offices went out, he rented an 
aircar and set it down on the top 
of the building. 

TTE walked across the roof, es- 
timating the distances with 
practiced ease, as if he’d under- 



gone extensive training and the 
apprenticeship period had been 
forgotten and only the skill re- 
mained. He knelt and fused two 
small rods to a portion of the 
roof, and then readjusted the 
torch and cut a small circular 
hole. He listened, and when there 
was no alarm, lifted out the sec- 
tion. There was nothing but 
darkness below. 

He fastened a rope to the air- 
car. He dropped the rope through 
the hole and slid down. Unless he 
had miscalculated, he was where 
he wanted to be, having bypassed 
all alarm circuits. There were 
others inside, he was reasonably 



FORGET ME NEARLY

certain of that, but with ordinary 
precautions he could avoid them. 

He flashed on a tiny light. He 
had guessed right; this was 
MEMORY LAB— the room he’d 
wanted to see this afternoon but 
hadn’t been able to. In front of 
him was the door to the waiting 
room, and beyond that the hall. 
He swung the light in an arc, 
flashing it over a desk and a piece 
of equipment the nature of which 
he didn’t know. Behind him was 
still another door. 

The desk was locked, but he 
took out a small magnetic device 
and jiggled it expertly over the 
concealed mechanism and then it 
was unlocked. He went hurriedly 
through papers and documents, 
but there was nothing with a 
name on it. He rifled the desk 
thoroughly and then went to the 
machine. 

He didn’t expect to learn any- 
thing, but he might as well ex- 
amine it. There was a place for 
a patient to sit, and a metal hood 
to fit over the patient’s head. He 
snapped the hood open and peer- 
ed into it. It seemed to have two 
functions. One circuit was far 
larger and more complicated, and 
he couldn’t determine what it 
did. But he recognized the other 
circuit; essentially it was a retro- 
gressor, but whereas the gun was 
crude and couldn’t be regulated, 
this was capable of fine adjust- 
ment — enough, say, to slice a day 



out of the patient’s life, and no 
more. 

That fitted with what had hap- 
pened to Luise. She had been ex- 
perimented on in some way, and 
then the memory of that experi- 
ment had been erased. But the 
man had grown careless and had 
taken away one day too many. 

He snapped the mechanism 
closed. This was the method, but 
he still didn’t know who the man 
was nor why he found it neces- 
sary to do all this. 

There was a door behind him 
and the answer might lie beyond 
it. He listened carefully, then 
swung the door open and went 
through. 

The blow that hit him wasn’t 
physical; nothing mechanical 
could take his nerves and jerk 
them all at once. A freezer. As he 
fell to the floor, he was grateful 
it was that and not a retro gun. 

Lights flooded the place, and 
the man of the afternoon inter- 
view was grinning at him. 

“I thought you’d be back,” he 
said, pleased. “In fact, I knew 
you would.” 

S OMEWHERE he had blun- 
dered; but he didn’t know 
how. Experimentally he wriggled 
his fingers. They moved a frac- 
tion of an inch, but no more. He 
was helpless and couldn’t say 
anything. He wasn’t quite sure at 
the moment that he wanted to.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You were right, I didn’t rec- 
ognize you physically,” continued 
the man. “Nevertheless, you gave 
yourself away. The name you 
used this afternoon, Chals Put- 
syn, is my name. Do you re- 
member now?” 

Of course. He’d chosen Chals 
Putsyn at random, because he’d 
had to say something, and every- 
thing would have been all right 
— except it actually hadn’t been 
a random choice. The associa- 
tions had triggered the wrong 
words into existence. 

His mind flashed back to the 
time he’d discussed names with 
Borgenese. What had he said? 

Putsy. But it wasn’t Putsy — ^it 
was Putsyn. 

“You’re very much improved,” 
said the real Chals Putsyn, star- 
ing curiously at him. “Let me 
recommend the retro treatment 
to you. In fact I’d take it myself, 
but there are a few inconveni- 
ences.” 

Yeah, there were inconveni- 
ences — like starting over again 
and not knowing who you were. 

But Putsyn was right: he was 
physically improved. A freezer 
knocked a man down and kept 
him there for half an hour. But 
Luis had only been down a few 
minutes, and already he could 
move his feet, though he didn’t. 
It was a phenomenally fast re- 
covery, and perhaps Putsyn 
wasn’t aware of it. 



“The question is, what to do 
with you?” Putsyn seemed to be 
thinking aloud. “The police are 
intolerant of killing. Maybe if I 
disposed of every atom . He 
shook his head and sighed. “But 
that’s been tried, and it didn’t 
make any difference. So you’ll 
have to remain alive — ^though I 
don’t think you’ll approve of my 
treatment.” 

Luis didn’t approve — it would 
be the same kind of treatment 
that Luise had been exposed to, 
but more drastic in his case, be- 
cause he was aware of what was 
going on. 

Putsyn came close to drag him 
away. It was time to use the 
energy he’d been saving up, and 
he did. 

Startled, Putsyn fired the 
freezer, but he was aiming at a 
twisting target and the invisible 
energy only grazed Luis’s leg. 
The leg went limp and had no 
feeling, but his two hands were 
still good and that was all he 
needed. 

He tore the freezer away and 
put his other hand on Putsyn’s 
throat. He could feel the artificial 
larynx inside. He squeezed.* 

He lay there until Putsyn went 
limp. 

W HEN there was no longer 
any movement, he sat up 
and pried open the man’s jaws, 
thrusting his fingers into the 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



153 



mouth and jerking out the arti- 
ficial larynx. The next time he 
would hear Putsyn’s real voice, 
and maybe that would trigger 
his memory. 

He crawled to the door and 
pulled himself up, leaning against 
the wall. By the time Putsyn 
moved, he had regained partial 
use of his leg. 

“Now we’ll see,’’ he said. He 
didn’t try to put anger in his 
voice; it was there. “I don’t have 
to tell you that I can beat an- 
swers out of you.’’ 

“You don’t know?’’ Putsyn 
laughed and there was relief in 
the sound. “You can kick me 
around, but you won’t get your 
answers!’’ 

The man had physical cour- 
age, or thought he did, and some- 
times that amounted to the same 
thing. Luis shifted uneasily. It 
was the first time he’d heard 
Putsyn’s actual voice; it was dis- 
turbing, but it didn’t arouse con- 
crete memories. 

He stepped on the outstretched 
hand. “Think so?” he said. He 
could hear the fingers crackle. 

Putsyn paled, but didn’t cry 
out. “Don’t think you can kill 
me and get away with it,” he 
said. 

He didn’t sound too certain. 

Slightly sick, Luis stepped off 
the hand. He couldn’t kill the 
man — and not just because of 
the police. He just couldn’t do it. 



He felt for the other gun in his 
pocket. 

“This isn’t a freezer,” he said. 
“It’s been changed over. I think 
I’ll give you a sample.” 

Putsyn blinked. “And lose all 
chance of finding out? Go ahead.” 
Luis had thought of that; but 
he hadn’t expected Putsyn to. 

“You see, there’s nothing you 
can do,” said Putsyn. “A man has 
a right to protect his property, 
and I’ve got plenty of evidence 
that you broke in.” 

“I don’t think you’ll go to the 
police,” Luis said. 

“You think not? My memory 
system isn’t a fraud. Admittedly, 
I didn’t use it properly on Luise, 
but in a public demonstration I 
can prove that it does work.” 
Luis nodded wearily to him- 
self. He’d half suspected that it 
did work. Here he was, with the 
solution so close — this man knew 
his identity and that of Luise, 
and where Dorn Starret came 
into the tangle — and he couldn’t 
force Putsyn to tell. 

He couldn’t go to the police. 
They would ignore his charges, 
because they were based on un- 
provable suspicions . ignore 
him or arrest him for breaking 
and entering. 

“Everything’s in your favor,” 
he said, raising the gun. “But 
there’s one way to make you 
leave us alone.” 

“Wait,” cried Putsyn, covering 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his face with his uninjured hand, 
as if that would shield him. 
“Maybe we can work out an 
agreement.” 

Luis didn’t lower the gun. “I 
mean it,” he said. 

“I know you mean it — I can’t 
let you take away my life’s work.” 

“Talk fast,” Luis said, “and 
don’t lie.” 

He stood close and listened 
while Putsyn told his story. 

This is what had happened, he 
thought. This is what he’d tried 
so hard to learn. 

“I had to do it that way,” Put- 
syn finished. “But if you’re will- 
ing to listen to reason, I can cut 
you in — more money than you’ve 
dreamed of — and the girl too, if 
you want her.” 

Luis was silent. He wanted her 
— but now the thought was fool- 
ish. Hopeless. This must be the 
way people felt who stood in the 
blast area of a rocket — but for 
them the sensation lasted only an 
instant, while for him the feeling 
would last the rest of his life. 

“Get up,” he said. 

“Then it’s all right?” asked 
Putsyn nervously. “We’ll share 
it?” 

“Get up.” 

Putsyn got to his feet, and Luis 
hit him. He could have used the 
freezer, but that wasn’t personal 
enough. 

He let the body fall to the 
floor. 



He dragged the inert form into 
the waiting room and turned on 
the screen and talked to the po- 
lice. Then he turned off the screen 
and kicked open the door to the 
hall. He shouldered Putsyn and 
carried him up to the roof and 
put him in the aircar. 

T UISE was there, puzzled and 
sleepy. For reasons of his 
own, Borgenese had sent a squad 
to bring her in. Might as well 
have her here and get it over with, 
Luis thought. She smiled at him, 
and he knew that Putsyn hadn’t 
lied about that part. She remem- 
bered him and therefore Putsyn 
hadn’t had time to do much 
damage. 

Borgenese was at the desk as 
he walked in. Luis swung Putsyn 
off his shoulder and dropped him 
into a chair. The man was still 
unconscious, but wouldn’t be 
for long. 

“I see you brought a visitor,” 
remarked Borgenese pleasantly. 

“A customer,” he said. 

“Customers are welcome too,” 
said the police counselor. “Of 
course, it’s up to us to decide 
whether he is a customer.” 

Luise started to cross the room, 
but Borgenese motioned her back. 
“Let him alone. I think he’s go- 
ing to have a rough time.” 

“Yeah,” said Luis. 

It was nice to know that Luise 
liked him now — because she 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



155 



wouldn’t after this was over. 

He wiped the sweat off his 
forehead: all of it hadn’t come 
from physical exertion. 

“Putsyn here is a scientist,” he 
said. ‘‘He worked out a machine 
that reverses the effects of the 
retro gun. He intended to go to 
everyone who’d been retrogressed, 
and in return for giving them 
back their memory, they’d sign 
over most of their property to 
him. 

“Naturally, they’d agree. They 
all want to return to their former 
lives that bad, and, of course, 
they aren’t aware of how much 
money they had. He had it all 
his way. He could use the ma- 
chine to investigate them, and 
take only those who were really 
wealthy. He’d give them a par- 
tial recovery in the machine, and 
when he found out who they 
were, give them a quick shot of 
a built-in retro gun, taking them 
back to the time they’d just 
entered his office. They wouldn’t 
suspect a thing. 

“Those who measured up he’d 
sign an agreement with, and to 
the other poor devils he’d say 
that he was sorry but he couldn’t 
help them.” 

Putsyn was conscious now. “It’s 
not so,” he said sullenly. “He 
can’t prove it.” 

“I don’t think he’s trying to 
prove that,” said Borgenese, still 
calm. “Let him talk.” 



Luis took a deep breath. “He 
might have gotten away with it, 
but he’d hired a laboratory as- 
sistant to help him perfect the 
machine. She didn’t like his 
ideas; she thought a discovery 
like that should be given to the 
public. He didn’t particularly 
care what she thought, but now 
the trouble was that she could 
build it too, and since he couldn’t 
patent it and still keep it secret, 
she was a threat to his plans.” 
He paused. “Her name was Luise 
Obispo.” 

H e didn’t have to turn his 
head. From the corner of his 
eye, he could see startlement 
flash across her face. She’d got 
her name right; and it was he 
who had erred in choosing a 
name. 

“Putsyn hired a criminal, Dorn 
Starret, to get rid of her for him,” 
he said harshly. “That was the 
way Starret made his living. He 
was an expert at it. 

“Starret slugged her one night 
on Mars. He didn’t retro her at 
once. He loaded .her on a space- 
ship and brought her to Earth. 
During the passage, he talked to 
her and got to like her a lot. She 
wasn’t as developed as she is 
now, kind of mousy maybe, but 
you know how those things are 
— he liked her. He made love to 
her, but didn’t get very far. 

“He landed in another city on 



156 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Earth and left his spaceship 
there; he drugged her and brought 
her to the Shelter here and ret- 
roed her. That’s what he’d been 
paid to do. 

“Then he decided to stick 
around. Maybe she’d change her 
mind after retrogression. He stay- 
ed in a Shelter just across from 
the one she was in. And he made 
a mistake. He hid the retro gun 
behind the screen. 

“Putsyn came around to check 
up. He didn’t like Starret stay- 
ing there — a key word or a famil- 
iar face sometimes triggers the 
memory. He retroed Starret, who 
didn’t have a gun he could get 
to in a hurry. Maybe Putsyn had 
planned to do it all along. He’d 
built up an airtight alibi when 
Luise disappeared, so that no- 
body would connect him with 
that — and who’d miss a criminal 
like Starret? 

“Anyway, that was only part 
of it. He knew that people who’ve 
been retroed try to find out who 
they are, and that some of them 
succeed. He didn’t want that to 
happen. So he put an advertise- 
ment in the paper that she’d see 
and answer. When she did, he 
began to use his machine on her, 
intending to take her from the 
present to the past and back 
again so often that her mind 
would refuse to accept anything, 
past or present. 

“But he’d just started when 



Starret showed up, and he knew 
he had to get him too. So he pull- 
ed what looked like a deliberate 
slip and got Starret interested, 
intending to take care of both of 
them in the same way at the 
same time.’’ 

He leaned against the wall. It 
was over now and he knew what 
he could expect. 

“That’s all, but it didn’t work 
out the way Putsyn wanted it. 
Starret was a guy who knew how 
to look after his own interests.” 

Except the biggest and most 
important one; there he’d failed. 

Borgenese was tapping on the 
desk, but it wasn’t really tapping 
— he was pushing buttons. A po- 
liceman came in and the counse- 
lor motioned to Putsyn: “Put him 
in the pre-trial cells.” 

“You can’t prove it,” said Put- 
syn. His face was sunken and 
frightened. 

“I think we can,” said the 
counselor indifferently. “You 
don’t know the efficiency of our 
laboratories. You’ll talk.” 

W HEN Putsyn had been re- 
moved, Borgenese turned. 
“Very good work, Luis. I’m 
pleased with you. I think in time 
you’d make an excellent police- 
man. Retro detail, of course.” 
Luis stared at him. 

"Didn’t you listen?” he said. 
“I’m Dorn Starret, a cheap 
crook.” 



FORGET ME NEARLY 



157 



In that mental picture of Star- 
ret he’d had, he should have seen 
it at once. Left-handed? Not at 
all — that was the way a man 
normally saw himself in a mir- 
ror. And in mirror images, the 
right hand becomes the left. 

The counselor sat up straight, 
not gentle and easygoing any 
longer. “I’m afraid you can’t 
prove that,” he said. “Finger- 
prints? Will any of Starret’s past 
associates identify you? There’s 
Putsyn, but he won’t be around 
to testify.” He smiled. “As final 
evidence let me ask you this; 
when he offered you a share in 
his crooked scheme, did you ac- 
cept? You did not. Instead, you 
brought him in, though you 
thought you were heading into 
certain retrogression.” 

Luis blinked dazedly. “But — ” 
“There are no exceptions, Luis. 
For certain crimes there is a pre- 
scribed penalty, retrogression. 
The law makes no distinction as 
to how the penalty is applied, 
and for a good reason. If there 
was such a . person, Dorn Starret 
ceased to exist when Putsyn ret- 
roed him — and not only legally.” 
Counselor Borgenese stood up. 
“You see, retroing a person 
wipes him clean of almost every- 
thing he ever knew — right and 
wrong. It leaves him with an 
adult body, and we fill his mind 
with adult facts. Given hdlf a 
chance, he acts like an adult.” 



Borgenese walked slowly to 
stand in front of his desk. “We 
protect life. Everybody’s life. In- 
cluding those who are not yet 
victims. We don’t have the death 
penalty and don’t want it. The 
most we can do to anyone is give 
him a new chance, via retrogres- 
sion. We have the same penalty 
for those who deprive another of 
his memory as we do for those 
who kill — with this difference : 
the man who retrogresses another 
knows he has a good chance to 
get away with it. The murderer 
is certain that he won’t. 

“That’s an administrative rule, 
not a law — that we don’t try to 
trace retrogression victims. It 
channels anger and greed into 
non -destructive acts. There are a 
lot of unruly emotions floating 
around, and as long as there are, 
we have to have a safety valve 
for them. Retrogression is the 
perfect instrument for that.” 
Luise tried to speak, but he 
waved her into silence. 

“Do you know how many were 
killed last year?” he asked. 

Luis shook his head. 

“Four,” said the counselor. 
“Four murders in a population 
of sixteen billion. That’s quite a 
record, as anyone knows who 
reads Twentieth Century mystery 
novels.” He glanced humorously 
at Luis. “You did, didn’t you?” 
Luis nodded mutely. 

Borgenese grinned. “I thought 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



so. There are only three types of 
people who know about finger- 
prints today, historians and po- 
licemen being two. And I didn’t 
think you were either.” 

Luise finally broke in. “Won’t 
Putsyn’s machine change things?” 
“Will it?” The counselor pre- 
tended to frown. “Do you re- 
member how to build it?” 

“I’ve forgotten,” she confessed. 
“So you have,” said Borgenese, 
“And I assure you Putsyn is go- 
ing to forget too. As a convicted 
criminal, and he will be, we’ll 
provide him with a false memory 
that will prevent his prying into 
the past. 

“That’s one machine we don’t 
want until humans are fully and 
completely civilized. It’s been in- 
vented a dozen times in the last 
century, and it always gets lost.” 
He closed his eyes momentari- 
ly, and when he opened them, 
Luise was looking at Luis, who 
was staring at the floor. 

“You two can go now,” he 
said. “When you get ready, there 
are jobs for both of you in my de- 
partment. No hurry, though; we’ll 
keep them open.” 

Luis left, went out through the 
long corridors and into the night. 



OHE caught up with him when 
^ he was getting off the belt 
that had taken him back to the 
Shelters. 

“There’s not much you can 
say, I suppose,” she murmured. 
“What can you tell a girl when 
she learns you’ve stopped just 
short of killing her?” 

He didn’t know the answer 
either. 

They walked in silence. 

She stopped at her dwelling, 
but didn’t go in. “Still, it’s an in- 
dication of how you felt — that 
you forgot your own name and 
took mine.” She was smiling now. 
“I don’t see how I can do less 
for you.” 

Hope stirred and he moved 
closer. But he didn’t speak. She 
might not mean what he thought 
she did. 

“Luis and Luise Obispo,” she 
said softly. “Very little change 
for me — just add Mrs. to it.” She 
was gazing at him with familiar 
intensity. “Do you want to come 
in?” 

She opened the door. 

Crime was sometimes the road 
to opportunity, and retrogression 
could be kind.
