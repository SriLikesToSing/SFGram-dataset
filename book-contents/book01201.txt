THE BOOK OF STEPHEN FABIAN 



THE VERDICT IS IN ON THE BEST OF STEPHEN 
FABIAN. 

Here is whii the critics have said about the first col- 
lection from the pen and brush of this daz/ting artist! 



“You can't flip the pages of Galaxy with your 
eyes open and fail to notice that Fabian is great . 
There are 50 plates in this . folio ... All are superb 
... and the repro is as good as that in THE FANTAS- 
TIC ART OF FRANK FRAZETTA. 

“It’s available . only by writing Loompanics 
Unlimited . $12.50 a hit. Worth it. by me.” 

Spider Robinson, Galaxy 



“Fabian is my kind of artist ... It was a real treat 
to Iwk thru his Loompanics artfolio. It made my 
" Forrest j. Ackerman 



“Loompanics Unlimited has published THE BEST 
OF STEPHEN FABIAN . The book presents 35 of 
Steve's best previously-published work plus 15 origi- 
nal drawings done especially for this bwk . The 
fact that I own 6 of the 50 drawings should say some- 
thing about my feelings for the art. Steve Isa fantas- 
tic talent and my only regrets about this book are it is 
too short, and that I do not own all the 50 drawings!” 
Stuart David Schiff, Whiy)crs 



“I say the Loompanics book . provides a wide 
range of Steve’s styles and skills, including quite a few 
previously unpublished full-pagers.” 

—Richard E. Geis (Alter Ego), Siience Fiction Review 



“Where has the sense of worsder gone from sf art? 
A healthy chunk of it can be found in THE BEST OF 
STEPHEN FABIAN, published by Loompanics Un- 
limited. 

"The book is . beautifully printed on one side 
of fine heavy stock . 

“. many of the plates are presented consider- 
ably larger than they originally appeared . But Fa- 
bian Is one of the few illustrators whose work doesn't 
wffer from being seen full si/c. In the 50 plates 
irKluding 15 never-before-published pieces done es- 
pecially for this volume- he dem«)nstrates an admir- 
able and enviable technique, a strong sense of drama, 
a contrasting but balarKcd delicacy and strength in 
his rendering, and a superb feel for the genre. 

"Probably more than any other black-and-white 
illustrator presently working In the sf magazine field, 
Fabian has the power to revive the excitement that 
was so rnuch the appeal of the old pulps. He'd have 
been quite at home in the pages of Weird Tales and 
would have held his own in the company of the best. 

“His art is Immediate ar>d arresting and often un- 
forgettable . .Many an author has wished for better 
illustrators; on many occasions Fabian’s work has de- 
served better authors. 

. .. Stephen Fabian's art is admirably suited to 
the subject matter it illustrates. THE BEST OF STE- 
PHEN FABIAN is a beautiful book, and a fine tribute 
to a deserving talent.” 

-George Barr, De/op's F 4 SF Review 




THE BEST OF STEPHEN FABIAN contains fifty oi 
this brilliant artist's finest drawings from Galaxy, If, 
Whispers, The Occult Lovecraft, Amazing, Fantastic, 
The Miscast Barbarian, Outworlds, and more, more, 
more . Including fifteen never before published 
drawings, done especially for this book. 

Each drawing is printed on one side of 8)5 x 1 1 80 lb. 
paper, easily removable for framing. This beautiful 
book is truly a collector's item, to be treasured now 
and in the years to come. 

THE BEST OF STEPHEN FABIAN is exactly ihat-

the truth was far stranger.

lic attention oil the coast of Guam. 
They .stixjd quietlv on the sea bed, 
three of them abreast, facing west 
towards the Guam shore. Behind 
them, plunginj: away rapidly to the 
abyssal depths, lay the Mariana 
Trench. Faint sunlight fled about 
their shadowy sides as they stirred 
slowly in the cold, steady upwell- 
ing. 

To the startled eyes of Lin Maro 
as he cruised along in his new gillcd 
form, they seemed to be musing 
forward, slowly and purposisely 
breasting the lip of the coastal shelf 
and gliding steadily from the black 
deeps to the distant stusre. l.in

of training and bio-leedback con-

osertime, he surged one hundred 
and fifty feet to the surface and 
struck out wildly for the shore and 
safety A quick look back con- 
smceil him that they were pursuing 
him. 

His glance caught the large, lu- 
mimnis eyes and the ropy tendrils 
of thick floating hair that framed the 
brisad faces. He was in too much of 
a hiuTv to notice the steel weights 
that licld them firmly and re- 
morselessly on the sea bed. 

The reaction' onshore was some- 
where between amusement and 
tipathy. It was Lin Maro's first time 
out in a real en\in>nment with his 
gilled form, and everybody knew 
there was a big difference between 
sitnulation and the real thing. lit-

N' hen the siory went out over the 
Com.Sat connections, it was still a 
long way down the news lists, tor 
three hundred years, writers had 



imagined Monsters ot the Deep 
coming out ot the .Mariana Tamch 
and tackling human civili/ation in a 
variety ot' nasty ways. Silly season 
reports helped to tili the blanks he- 
tween lamines and the real crises, 
but they got scnmi interest from the 
news prol'essionals. Nobody re- 
ported panic along the coast, or fled 
to the high ground. 

The three monsters got the most 
interest from the Ctuam atjuariiim 
and vi\ariuni. party of marine 
biologists inspected them on the

The first lab examinations showed 
immediate anomalies. They were 
land animals, not marine forms: 
lung breathers, wiih tough outer 
skins and massive bone structure. 



Charles 



As a matter of routine, tissue mi- 
crotome samples were taken and a 
chromosome I.D. run for matches 
with known species. The patterns 
were transmitted to the central data 
banks. 

At that point every attention 
light on the planet, tiguratively 
speaking, went on, the whistles 
blew and the buzzers buzzed. The 
computer response was unambigu- 
ous and instantaneous. The chromo- 
some patterns were human. 

★ ★ ♦ 

The information that moves 
ceaselessly over the Earth, by cable, 
by ComSat Link, by Mattin Link, 
by laser and by microwave, is fo- 
cused and redistributed through a 
small number of nodes. At one of 
these nodes sits the Office of Form 
Control; and in this office, deli- 
cately feeling the vibrations and dis- 
turbances of the normal patterns that 
flow in along the strands of the in- 
formation web, sits Behrooz Wolf. 
The spider analogy would not dis- 
please him, though he would point 
out that his is only one of many 
webs, all interlocking. Not by any 
means the most important one: 
Population, Food and Space Sys- 
tems all have much bigger staffs 
and bigger webs. But he would 
argue that his problems have the 
shortest response times and need a 
reaction speed that the others can 
manage without. 

Take the Mariana Monsters — the 
Press’ dubbing — as an example. As 
soon as the chromosome patterns 
were revealed as human, the Form 
Control office was alerted. It looked 
as though a group of humans had 



been using the bio-feedback 
machines in unsuccessful form- 
change experiments. Were the ex- 
periments autnonzed, and were the 
resulting forms on the forbidden 
list? Was quick action needed to 
stop the appearance of a new illegal 
form? 

Behrooz Wolf sat in his office as 
the data began to flow in. None of 
the official and approved form- 
change experiments was anything 
like the one found off the shore of 
Guam. In addition, cell tests were 
looking strange in both chemistry 
and structure. The lungs were mod- 
ified, showing a change in alveolar 
patterns, as though the creatures 
were adapting to high pressure. And 
the big eyes, although sensitive to 
low light levels, were most sensitive 
in the near infrared wavelengths 
that are cut off almost completely 
under water. 

Bey Wolf liked to approach his 
job using very basic questions. 
What was the objective of a form? 
Where would it operate most effec- 
tively? From those answers, he 
could usually guess the next step in 
the form-change sequence. The 
Mariana Monsters were breaking the 
rules. They did not seem to be 
adapting to any environment at all. 

All right, let’s try another tack. 
The Monsters hadn’t got there by 
themselves. After they had died, 
apparently of asphyxiation, they had 
been weighted with steel, then 
dropped, probably from a ship, to 
the sea bed. Where had they come 
from? Bey had a complete list of 
the world’s form-change centers at 
his fingertips, especially the ones 
that were elaborate enough to need 
special life support systems. That 



6 



GALAXY 



offered no clues either. 

Wolfs unsuccessful initial prob- 
ing was interrupted by the anival of 
his assistant John Lai^, back from 
a routine meeting on the certification 
of new BEC forms. He poked his 
cheerful face in the door, then 
stopped, surprised by the mass of 
new listings and piles of form- 
change tabulations that had ap- 
peared in Bey Wolfs already clut- 
tered office. 

“Come in, John.” Wolf waved 
an arm. “What did you pick up at 
your meeting? Anything interest- 
ing?” 

Larsen dropped into a chair, 
pushing a pile of listings out of the 
way and marvelling as usual at 
Bey’s ability to operate cleanly and 
logically in the middle of such a 
mess. 

“Two good ones,” he replied. 
“C-forms, both of them, adapted 
for long periods in low gravity. 
They’ll revolutionize asteroid work. 
There were the usual formal protests 
from the Belter representatives.” 

“There’ll always be Luddites.” 
Bey Wolf had a weakness for out- 
moded historical references. “That 
law will have to change soon. The 
C-forms are so much better than the 
old ones that there’s no real compe- 
tition. Capman has changed space 
exploration forever, as soon as the 
Belters will let his work be ac- 
cepted. Here, let me fill you in on 
our latest headache.” 

He ran rapidly over the 
background to the Mariana discov- 
eries, finishing with the question of 
where they had come from. 

“I suspect that they got into the 
general area of the Marianas 
through one of the Mattin Links. 

LEGACY 



The question is, which one? We 
have twenty to choose from.” 

John La^n went over to the wall 
display, which was showing the lo- 
cations of the Mattin Link entry 
points. 

“We can rule out a few of them; 
they’re open ocean and only act as 
transfer points. Have you correlated 
the form-change lab locations with 
the Mattin Link entry points?” 

“I’m waiting for that to come 
back from the computer. I’ve also 
asked for an identification of the 
three individuals whose bodies were 
found on the sea bed. I don’t know 
why that’s taking so long. Central 
Records knows that it’s a high prior- 
ity item.” 

He joined Larsen at the wall 
charts, and they reviewed the loca- 
tions of the Mattin Links that serve 
as the twenty pivot points for the 
global transportation system. When 
the communicator screen beeped for 
attention Larsen went to it, leaving 
Wolf engrossed in the wall charts. 
He watched the first words of the 
message scroll onto the screen, then 
whistl^ softly. 

“Come and look at this, Bey. 
There’s the reason Records took a 
while to get us an I.D. from the 
chromosome pattern.” 

The message began: ‘I.D. Search 
completed and identification fol- 
lows: Individuals are: James Pear- 
son Manaur, age 34, nationality 
U.S.F.; Caperta Leferte, age 26, 
Nationality U.S.F.; Lao Sama Prek, 
age 30, Nationality U.S.F. 
Continue/Halt?’ 

Wolf hit ‘Continue’ and the de- 
tailed I.D. records appeared — 
education, work history, family. 
But their attention was already 

7 



elsewhere. The three dead men 
were all members of the United 
Space Federation; that spelled out a 
mystery. 

The United Space Federation had 
declared its sovereignty fifty years 
earlier, in 2142. With headquarters 
at the Tycho lunar base, it rep- 
resented the interests of all the hu- 
mans living off-Earth, in the Belt, 
on the Moon, and in the Earth- 
Moon Libration Point colonies. 
U.S.F. citizens were rarities on 
Earth, and the disappearance of 
three of them should have roused an 
outcry long before their changed 
bodies had been found off Guam. 

The two men looked at each 
other. Wolf nodded at Larsen’s 
puzzled expression. “It makes no 
sense. The U.S.F. has an out-and- 
out ban on form-changes. If they 
won’t accept the C-forms, it’s even 
less likely they’d be doing indepen- 
dent development of new forms. 
One thing is for sure. I’ll have to 
get a U.S.F. man in here — it’s too 
sensitive now.’’ 

He looked gloomy. The investiga- 
tion had just grown two orders of 
magnitude. There was no way to go 
further without involving U.S.F. 
representatives. Already they were 
on the verge of an interplanetary 
incident. 

The communicator continued to 
pump out information, in display 
and hard copy. Wolf noticed that it 
was giving the correlation he had 
asked for between form-change cen- 
ters and Mattin Link entry points. It 
was going to be a long and confus- 
ing day. 

Not surprisingly, BEC was get- 
ting into the act too. An incoming 
news release set out their official 



position on the Mariana Monsters. 

‘Biological tquipment Corpora- 
tion (BEC) today released a formal 
statement denying all knowledge of 
the human bodies discovered re- 
cently off the coast of Guam. A 
BEC representative said that the 
bodies had clearly been subject to 
form-change, but no BEC program 
developments, past or present, 
could lead to forms anything like 
those found. In an unusual proce- 
dure, BEC released records showing 
forms now under development in 
the Company and invited Govern- 
ment inspection of their facilities. 
BEC is fte pioneer in and world’s 
largest manufacturer of purposive 
form-change equipment utilizing 
biological feedback control 
methods.’ 

Bey read the release through and 
passed it to Larsen. 

“It looks as though BEC is in the 
clear but running scared. I’ve been 
waiting for them to plead innocent 
or guilty. That’s another prospect 
off the list of possibles.’’ 

* * * 

Larsen trailed out with yards of 
listings. Bey Wolf sat back again to 
wait for a pattern to emerge. The 
facts were suggestive. One name 
kept coming into his head, haunting 
him out of the past. Robert Cap- 
man, inventor of the C-forms, rec- 
ognized without dispute as the 
greatest-ever expert on form-change 
methods. Robert Capman, ex- 
Director of Central Hospital and ad- 
visor to the Planetary Coordinators. 
But also Robert Capman, branded 
as a mass murderer and officially 
dead for six years.

Top U.S.F. men, like top kanu 
players, are usually on the small 
skinny side. It was a surprise to 
greet a wrestler, two meters tall, 
and find he was the U.S.F. man as- 
signed to work with Form Control 
on the Guam case. Bey Wolf 
glanced up at him and bit back the 
question on the tip of his tongue. 

Park Green was regarding him 
closely, a smile on his big, baby 
face. 

“Go on, Mr. Wolf, ask me,” he 
said. “Most people do eventually. 
In fact, let me answer you in ad- 
vance. No, I don’t use the bio- 
feedback equipment and form- 
change myself this way. It’s com- 
pletely natural. But it makes life 
hard when you’re trying to act as 
representative to the U.S.F., and 
form-change is illegal off-Earth.” 

Bey Wolf nodded appreciatively. 
“On the marie. I didn’t think I was 
so easy to read.” 

; “I’ve had lots of practice on that 
question. Let me ask you some. 
What’s new on the Guam case? I’ve 
got to give a report back to Tycho 
City tonight. Do you know the time 
, and cause of death yet?” 
i “Three days ago. They all died 
I within about twelve hours of each 
' other, of asphyxiation — and here’s 
, the strange part. Their lungs were 
full of normal air. No gaseous 
poisons, no contaminants. They 
shouldn’t have choked. They were 
I dropped off Guam about twenty- 
I four hours after they died, almost 
1 certainly at night. My guess is that 
they died somewhere a long way 
from there.” 

“Excuse my ignorance of the 
case, but 1 don’t follow your 
logic.” 



“Well, it is conjectural. But I 
think they were intended for the 
bottom of the Mariana Trench. Five 
miles down, they’d never have been 
found. I think they were acci- 
dentally dropped a few miles too far 
west — by somebody who didn’t 
know the local geography too well. 
I’d say they died by accident, and 
somebody was keen to hide the evi- 
dence as far away as they could. 
You don’t look very surprised,” 
Wolf added, seeing that Green was 
slowly nodding agreement. 

The big man squeezed himself 
into a chair and rubbed his chin 
with an eleven-inch hand. 

“It fits with some of the things I 
know myself.” he replied. “What 
else did you find out about the tfiree 
dead men?” 

“Not much,’’ replied Wolf. 
“They were Belters, all off the 
same ship, the ‘Jason.’ They arrived 
here on Earth three weeks ago with 
plenty of money. Nobody heard of 
them again until they were found 
off Guam. We don’t trail U.S.F. 
citizens unless we get a request 
from you for it.” 

“That’s all correct as far as it 
goes,’’ agreed Green. “You are 
missing a few things that make a 
big difference. First, you say they 
were Belters, and technically you 
are right. But in U.S.F. wording, 
they were really Grabbers. They 
had been out in space on the ‘Jason’ 
for over two years — .”

Caperta Laferte, spotter for the 
U.S.F. Class B cargo ship ‘Jason,’ 
was watching the scope of the deep 
radar with mounting excitement. By

his left hand, the computer print-out 
was chattering with increasing speed 
as it perform^ the final orbit match 
and confirmed the tracking of the 
find. 

Laferte wiped the perspiration 
from his face with a dirty cloth. 

“It matches exactly,” he told the 
other two. "And it looks like a big 
one. I’ll be able to get us a radioac- 
tivity reading from it in a couple of 
minutes. But it’s a piece of old 
Loge, no doubt about it.” 

The others hovered about in im- 
potent excitement. Until they had 
matched and docked it was one 
man’s work and they could do noth- 
ing more useful than speculate on 
their trophy. Grimy and worn, all 
three locked like men who had en- 
dured more than two years of solar 
flares and radiation storms, celibacy 
and grinding boredom. It would all 
be worth it. If this were the big 
one, it would pay for all of it. 
Wine, women and song were on the 
way. 

“Radioactivity count coming in 
now,” announced Laferte. “I’ve 
tuned it for the 15 MeV dipole 
transition from Asfanium. Keep 
your eye on the counter. If it hits 
fo^ or better, it’s the jackpot.” 

The digital read-out was climbing 
steadily. At twenty they lost it for a 
second. Laferte swore, bent back 
over the control panel, and re- 
calibrated. It climbed again, past 
twenty, to thirty, to forty, and was 
still moving steadily upwards. They 
all shouted and James Manaur and 
Lao Sama Prek joined hands and 
began a curious Walrus-and- 
Carpenter dance. It was the best 
that could be managed in the com- 
bination of free-fall and confined 



space. The future was a rosy glow, 
full of wealth, high living and ex- 
citement. Old Loge had b«n gone a 
long time, but enough of him had 
come back to gladden a few hearts. 

* * * 

“ — looking for transuranics,” 
said Green. “Maybe you know, the 
only natural source in the Solar Sys- 
tem is still the fragments of Loge 
that come back into the System as 
long-period comets. The Grabbers 
just sit out there for years and 
monitor using deep radar. One de- 
cent find and they are made for life. 
The ‘Jason’ caught a good one 
about three months ago, packed 
with 112 and 114 Asfanium and 
Polkium. They extracted the trans- 
uranic elements from the fragment 
and rolled into Tycho City a month 
ago, rich as Katkov. They started to 
celebrate and three weeks ago they 
came to Earth to continue the spree. 
After that we lost touch with them 
and don’t know what they did. We 
expected them back when the 
fleshpots palled. Want me to make 
a guess on what they did?” 

Wolf nodded. “1 think I see 
where you are leading, but go on.” 

“They came to Earth,” continued 
Park Green. “Now, I saw them just 
before they left Tycho. They looked 
terrible. A couple of years of hard- 
ship in space, then a celebration 
that you wouldn’t believe when they 
reached the Moon. If you came to 
Earth in that condition, wouldn’t 
there be a big temptation to do 
something a bit illegal — and hook- 
up for an intensive session with a 
bio-feedback machine, set to get 
you back to tip-tc^ physical shape 



10 



GALAXY 



as fast as legally possible — or 
faster?” 

“There certainly would,” Wolf 
agreed. “I know a thousand places 
where it could be done. What you 
say makes perfect sense. Now let 
me pick up on my side of it.” 

He pressed the inter-office com- 
municator and asked John Larsen to 
join them. When Larsen entered the 
room, Bey Wolf turned again to 
Park Green. 

“Before I get John’s opinions, 
tell me what you know about 
Robert Capman. I assure you it’s 
relevant,” he added, seeing Green’s 
puzzled look. 

The big U.S.F. man thought for a 
moment before he replied. 

“All I can really tell you is what 
I’ve heard in Tycho City,” he said 
finally. “Capman was a great man 
here on Earth, a genius who in- 
vented the series of form-changes 
that we now call C-forms, adapted 
for life in space. He did it using 
human children as the subjects for 
form-change experiments. Some of 
them died. He was found out a few 
years ago and died himself trying 
to escape. Is there more to know?” 

“1 think there is, but I may be 
biased,” replied Wolf. “For one 
thing, it was John and 1 who han- 
dled the case and blew the whistle 
on Capman. Now let me ask you, 
do you have strong feelings about 
Capman, personally?” 

Green hesitated again. “That’s 
really a tough one. I £iow his repu- 
tation for great genius. And hon- 
estly, I don’t know enough to say if 
he was fairly treated when he was 
accused of using human children in 
his work. But I will tell you, as a 
representative of the U.S.F. I have 



to be against Capman. After all, he 
was the man who invented the 
forms that are supposed to make me 
and my fellows as obsolete for life 
in space as the dinosaurs — the 
forms he came up with don’t need 
much air, they’re radiation tolerant, 
and they can adapt to run at high or 
low metabolic rates. I’ve no reason 
to like the man, for those reasons 
alone. Why do you ask?” 

“I have a reason,” said Wolf. 
He turned to Larsen. “John, you 
were there when Capman died. Did 
he die?” 

“I thought so at the time.” John 
Larsen sighed and shrugged his 
shoulders. “Now, I’m not so sure.” 
He turned to the U.S.F. man. “Bey 
is convinced it was a set-up, and I 
must admit it had the makings of 
one. He hasn’t been heard of for the 
six years since then, but I’ll tell 
you, in the last day I’ve been think- 
ing about him. These Guam form- 
changes have just the marks of 
Capman.” 

Wolf looked at Larsen with relief 
and increased respect. “I’d been 
thinking that, John, myself, but it 
seemed too unlikely to come right 
out and say it.” He turned again to 
Park Green. “Now, you see how 
our thoughts have been running. 
Earth’s greatest expert ever on 
form-change, Robert Capman. 
Maybe still alive, in hiding, some- 
where on Earth. And along comes a 
set of form-changes that defy all 
logic, that conform to no known 
models. It could be Capman, up to 
his old tricks again. Either way, if 
Capman is alive, he’d be just the 
man to talk to about this. John or I 
could have added one other 
thing — neither of us ever met a 



LEGACY 



11 



man, before or since, who im- 
pressed us as much with his sheer 
intellectual power.” 

Green moved about uneasily in 
his seat. “It’s clear you’re selling 
me something, but 1 still don’t 
know what it is. What are you lead- 
ing up to?” 

Bey Wolf nodded vigorously. 
“Only this, 1 want to find Robert 
Capman. And 1 have a very strong 
suspicion of my own. I think he’s 
not on Earth — hasn’t been for the 
past six years. Will you help me 
reach him, if he’s somewhere in the 
U.S.F. territories? I don’t know if 
it’s the Moon, the Belt, the Libra- 
tion Colonies, or where — but I do 
know I can’t get messages out there 
without U.S.F. help!” 

Green looked speculative. ‘‘I 
can’t give you an instant answer,” 
he said. “I’ll have to discuss it in 
person with Ambassador Brodin, 
and he’s in Argentina.” He stood 
up. “What’s the best way to get me 
there?” 

“Through the Mattin Link sys- 
tem. There’s an entry point in cen- 
tral Argentina. We are only ten 
minutes away from the Madrid 
link — two jumps and you’ll be 
there. Come on. I’ll show you how 
to use it.” 

They hurried out, as Green ex- 
plained that he was having trouble 
getting used to the complexity of 
the Earth system. The Moon had 
only four link entry points. The 
Earth had twenty and he had heard 
there would be more added. Was 
that true? 

It was not, and it would never 
be. The Mattin Link system offers 
direct and instantaneous transmis- 
sion between any adjacent pair of 



entry points. But the number of 
entry points, and their placing, is 
very rigid. Since it requires perfect | 
symmetry of any entry point with j 
respect to all others, the configura- 
tion must fit one of the five regular ! 
solids. Plato would have loved it. ; 

The dodecahedral system, with 
twenty vertices on the surface of the 
Earth, is the biggest single system 
that can ever be made. The Lunar i 
system, with its four entry points at ^ 
the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, | 
is the simplest. And Mattin Links 
away from planetary surfaces are 
impractical because of changing dis- 
tances. 

Gerald Mattin, who had dreamed 
of a system for instantaneous 
energy-free transfer between any 
two points anywhere, died a disap- | 
pointed man. The present system is i 
far from energy-free — because the 
Earth is not a homogeneous perfect 
sphere, and space-time is slightly 
curved near it. Mattin had an 
energy-free solution defined for an 
exact geometry in a flat space-time. 
He died twenty years before the de- 
cision to build the first Mattin Link 
system, twenty-five years before the 
first university was named after 
him, thirty years before the first 
statue. 

* * * 

“We have a go-ahead, but 1 had 
to bargain my soul away to get an 
agreement from the Ambassador. 
Now, where do we go from here?” 

Park Green was back in Bey 
Wolfs office, shoes off, long legs 
stretched out and adding to the gen- 
eral appearance of confusion. Wolf 
and Larsen were again over by the 



12 



GALAXY 



wall display, plotting the Mattin 
Link paths from the Mariana Trench 
entry point and the Australia entry 
point near the spaceport where the 
crew of the ‘Jason’ had arrived on 
Earth. Wolf read off the results be- 
fore he replied to Park Green. 

“The North Australian entry 
point connects directly to the 
Marianas, Southern New Zealand 
and an Indian Ocean transfer point. 
The Mariana entry point connects 
directly to North China, Hawaii and 
back of course to North Australia. 
None of those connections looks 
promising, there’s no big form- 
change lab near any of them. So 
either my guess about the use of the 
Link system is wrong, or the people 
who moved the Monsters did more 
than one jump in the system. Two 
jumps takes us a lot further 
afield — to almost anywhere. Up to 
the North Pole, to Cap City at the 
South Pole, or into India, or up to 
western North America.’’ 

He looked over at Park Green. 
“It’s a mess. I’m more convinced 
than ever that we need to find 
Robert Capman and develop some 
idea what was happening when the 
three men died. They obviously 
started on some form-change pro- 
^m and somewhere along the line 
it got fouled up. How? I wish 1 
could ask Capman that question.’’ 

“So let me repeat my question,’’ 
said Green. “What do we do next, 
and where do we go from here? 
Advertising for Capman won’t solve 
the problem — he’ll be treated as a 
mass murderer if he ever does show 
up alive.” 

“I think 1 can produce a message 
that Capman will recognize and be 
intrigued by, but others won’t,” an- 



swered Wolf. “As for protecting 
him if he does show himself. I’m 
not worried about that. I’m sure that 
he’ll have found a way to cover 
himself in the past six years. I’ve 
got another worry of my own. We 
have no way of knowing how ur- 
gent this thing is. It could be a once 
in a lifetime accident or the start of 
a general plague. Until we know 
which I have to look on it as the 
hottest thing on my list of prob- 
lems. Let me take a cut at the mes- 
sage to Capman.” 

The final announcement was 
short and simple. It went out on a 
general broadcast over all media to 
the eight billion on Earth, and by 
special transmission to the scattered 
three million members of the United 
Space Federation. 

‘To R.C. I badly need the talents 
that caused me to pursue you six 
years ago through the by-ways of 
Old City. I promise you a problem 
worthy of your powers. Behrooz 
Wolf.’ 

it it It 

Troubles were mounting. Bey 
spent a couple of hours with a rep- 
resentative of BEC, who insisted on 
presenting more confidential records 
to prove that the company had no 
connection with the monster forms 
found in Guam. The Central Coor- 
dinators sent him a terse message, 
asking him if there would be other 
deaths of the same type, and if so, 
when and how many? Park Green 
was getting the same sort of pres- 
sure from the U.S.F. Unlike Bey 
Wolf, the big man wasn’t used to it 
and spent a good part of his time in 
Bey’s office, gloomily biting his 



LEGACY 



13 



nails and trying to construct posi- 
tively worded replies with no in- 
formation content. 

Two days of that brought a 
stronger response from Tycho City. 
Bey arrived in his office early and 
found a small, neatly dressed man 
standing by the communicator call- 
ing out U.S.F. personnel records. 
He turned at Bey’s entry, with no 
sign of embarrassment at his intru- 
sion, and looked at Bey for a sec- 
ond before he spoke. 

“Mr. Green?’’ The voice was 
like the man, small and precise. 

“He’ll be in later. I’m Behrooz 
Wolf, head of Form Control. What 
can I do for you?’’ Bey was some- 
what conscious of his own casual 
appearance and uncombed hair. 

The man drew himself up to his 
full height. “I am Karl Ling, spe- 
cial assistant to the U.S.F. Cabinet. 
Here are my credentials.” The tone 
was peppery and irascible. “I have 
been sent here to get some real an- 
swers about the deaths of three of 
our citizens here on Earth. 1 must 
tell you that we regard the expla- 
nations given so far by your office 
and Mr. Green as profoundly un- 
satisfactory.” 

“Arrogant bastard,” thought Bey, 
while he looked for a suitably con- 
ciliatory answer. 

“We have been doing our best to 
provide you with all the facts, Mr. 
Ling,” he said. “It seemed unwise 
to present theories until they can be 
definitely verified. I’m sure you re- 
alize that this case is complex and 
has features that we haven’t encoun- 
tered before.” 

“Apparently.” Karl Ling had 
taken a seat by the communicator 
and was tapping his thigh nervously 



with a well-manicured left hand. 
“For example, I see that you are 
giving the cause of death as asphyx- 
iation. But you tell us also that the 
dead men had plenty of air in their 
lungs, and that there were no 
poisonous constituents. Perhaps you 
would like to present your theory on 
that to me.” 

E>ealing in the past with officious 
government representatives, Bey 
had found an effective method of 
subduing them. He thought of it as 
his saturation technique. The trick 
was to flood the nuisance with so 
many facts, figures, reports and 
data that he was inundated and 
never seen again. He went over to 
his desk and took out a black record 
pad. 

“This has the data entry codes 
that will allow you to pull all the 
records on this case. 1 suggest that 
you use my office here and feel free 
to use my communicator to reach 
Central Files. Nothing will be hid- 
den from you. This machine has a 
full access code.” 

The little man stood up, a gleam 
in his eyes. He rubbed his hands 
together. 

“Excellent. Please arrange it so 
that I am not disturbed — but I do 
want to see Mr. Green when he ar- 
rives.” 

Far from being subdued. Ling 
was clearly delighted at the prospect 
of a flood of information. Bey es- 
caped with relief and went to give 
the bad news to Park Green. 

“Karl Ling?” Green looked im- 
pressed. “Oh, I know him — not 
personally, but by reputation. He’s 
the U.S.F. leading expert on Loge. 
He’s a fanatic on the subject, really. 
I saw a holovision program he made 



14 



GALAXY 



a couple of years ago where he 
traced the whole history of Loge. 
He began way back, five hundred 
years ago — 

* * * 

(Cameras move from model and 
back to Ling, standing.) 

“School-capsules give the 1970’s 
as the first date in Loge’s history. 
We can find him much further back 
than that. All the way back in 1766, 
when a German astronomer came 
up with a scheme to define the dis- 
tances of the planets from the Sun. 
Johann Titius’ work was picked up 
and made famous a few years later 
by another German, Johann Bode. 
The relation is called the Titius- 
Bode Law.” 

(Cut to framed lithograph of 
Bode, then to table of planetary dis- 
tances.) 

“Bode pointed out that there was 
a curious gap in the distance for- 
mula, between Mars and Jupiter. 
When William Herschel discovered 
Uranus in 1781 — ” 

(Cut to high resolution color 
image of Uranus, with image of 
Herschel as insert on upper left. Cut 
back to Ling.) 

“ — he found it fitted Bode’s law 
also. The search for a missing 
planet began. In 1800 the asteroid 
Ceres was discovered at the correct 
distance from the Sun. The first 
piece of Loge had been found.” 

(Cut to high resolution image of 
Ceres. Zoom in on Ceres City. Cut 
to diagram showing planetary dis- 
tances, then back to Ling.) 

“As more and more asteroids 
were found, the theory grew that 
they were fragments of a single 



planet. In 1972 the Canadian as- 
tronomer Ovenden provided the first ' 
real proof. Using the rates of 
change in the orbits of the planets, 
he showed they were consistent ; 
with the disappearance from the I 
Solar System of a body of planetary 
mass, roughly sixteen million years 
ago. He estimated that the missing 
planet was about ninety times the 
mass of the Earth. Loge was begin- 
ning to take on a definite shape.” 

(Cut to image of Ovenden, then i 
to artist’s impression of the size and • 
appearance of Loge, next to image • 
of the Earth on same scale.) i 

“The next part of the story came i 
just a few years later, in 1975. Van ; 
Flandem in America integrated the 
orbits of very long peri^ comets i 
backwards in time. They found that ; 
many of them had periods of about 
sixteen million years and had left ' 
from a particular part of the Solar 
System, between the orbits of Mars 
and Jupiter. Parts of Loge were 
coming home.” 

(Cut to diagram showing comet- 
ary orbits, intersecting Solar System 
diagram at point between Mars and 
Jupiter. Cut back to Ling.) 

“We now had the modem view 
of Loge. A large planet, a gas-giant 
about ninety E^h masses, disinte- 
grated about sixteen million years 
ago in a cataclysm beyond our imag- 
ining. Most of Loge was blown 
out of the Solar System forever. A 
few parts of the planetary cote re- 
main as the asteroids, other frag- 
ments from the outer crust drop 
back into the Solar System from 
time to time as long-period com- 
ets.” 

(Move in to close-up of Ling, 
face and shoulders only.) 



16 



GALAXY 



“That looked like the end of the 
story, until we picked up the first 
pieces of the long-period cometary 
fragments in the twenty-first century 
and found they were high in trans- 
uranic elements. The mystery of 
Lx)ge remains. Why should Loge, 
alone of all the Solar System, con- 
tain transuranic elements? Their 
half-lives are less than twenty mil- 
lion years. Were they formed in the 
explosion of Lxjge? If so, how? To 
those questions, we still do not have 
answers.” 

(Cut to image of Loge, feed in 
beginning of fade-out music, low 
volume.) 

“One final and tantalizing fact. 
Sixteen million years is like yester- 
day on the cosmic scale. When 
Loge disintegrated there were pri- 
mates already on the Earth. Did our 
early ancestors look into the skies 
one night, and see the fearful sight 
of Loge’s explosion? Will other 
planets ever suffer a similar fate?” 

(Fade out as image of Loge 
swells, changes color, breaks asun-

“ — but it puzzles me why Ling 
should be appointed to this investi- 
gation. He writes his own ticket, of 
course. Maybe he knew one of the 
dead Grabbers — he certainly knew 
everything and everyone connected 
with Loge in any way.” Green fell 
silent, then shodc his head. “1 sup- 
pose I’d better get in there and find 
out what he wants me to do. I hope 
I’m not being demoted to messenger 
boy.” 

Together Green and Wolf went 



back into Bey’s office. Karl Ling 
was oblivious of their entry, deeply 
engrossed in his review of autopsy 
records of the three dead crew 
members of the ‘Jason.’ Wolfs sat- 
uration technique didn’t work on 
Ling. He became aware of them 
only when Bey Wolf spoke. 

“Mr. Ling, we are ready to give 
you a briefing when you want it. 
This is Mr. Green, from U.S.F.” 

Ling looked up briefly, then re- 
turned his attention to the medical 
records. “Good. Answer one basic 
question for me. The three dead 
men have clearly been through a 
form-change process. Where are the 
bio-feedback machines located that 
were used for that?” 

“We don’t have an answer to 
that. Sir,” replied Wolf. “Though 
of course we recognize its impor- 
tance.” 

Ling looked up again. For some 
reason it seemed to be the response 
he was hoping for. “No answer, 
Mr. Wolf? I thought that might be 
the case. Would you like me to en- 
, lighten you?” 

Bey felt a minor urge to go over 
and choke Ling but managed a cool 
reply. “If you can. Though it is 
hard for me to imagine that you 
could have reached a conclusion on 
such a brief inspection of the rec- 
ords.” 

“1 did not. I knew before I left 
the Moon.” He smiled briefly and 
stood up. “You see, Mr. Wolf, I 
have no doubt that you and the 
other members of Form Control 
here on Earth are proficient in your 
work. But this particular situation 
requires something that by defini- 
tion you do not possess — the ability 
to think as a U.S.F. citizen. For

example, if you were a millionaire, 
where on Earth would you choose 
to go for your entertainment? Re- 
member, you may choose freely 
without thought of cost.” 

‘‘Probably to the Great Barrier 
Reef, in a gilled form.” 

‘‘Very good.” Karl Ling turned 
to Park Green. ‘‘You are a Belter, 
Mr. Green, and suddenly a mil- 
lionaire. Where on all of Earth 
would you want to go — what is the 
Belter’s dream of a place for all the 
most exotic delights?” 

Green scratched his chin thought- 
fully. ‘‘Why, I guess it would be 
Pleasure Dome. That’s the place we 
hear about, though I’ve never been 
there.” 

“Of course you haven’t,” re- 
sponded Ling impatiently, ‘‘and 
neither has anyone else who is not 
extremely rich. But it’s the Belter’s 
idea of Paradise — and part of the 
reason you would want to go there 
would be to prove how rich you 
were.” 

He went over to the large map 
display on the far wall and called 
out a South Polar projection. 

“Let’s take this a little further. 
Look at the geography. The crew of 
the ‘Jason’ landed here at the Aus- 
tralian space port. Within easy 
ground transport distance of the 
North Australian Mattin Link. One 
transfer gets them to New Zealand, 
a second one puts them to Cap City 
in Antarctica. Now Pleasure Dome, 
as 1 am sure you know, Mr. Wolf, 
though perhaps Mr. Green does not, 
lies directly l^neath Cap City in the 
Antarctic ice cap. Total travel time 
from the space port — an hour or 
less.” 

Park Green nodded slowly. “I 



guess so. I’m not yet used to the 
number of Link entry points you have 
here. I don’t see where that gets us, 
though. We need a place with sophis- 
ticated form-change equipment. I 
didn’t see Cap City or Pleasure Dome 
on any list of labs that Mr. Wolf 
showed me.” 

Karl Lin^ smiled ironically. “I’m 
sure you didn’t. You saw the legal 
list.” He turned to Bey, who had [ 
some idea what was coming and felt 
a growing excitement. “Pleasure 
Dome offers all pleasures, does it 
not, Mr. Wolf? Even the most exot- 
ic. Would it be safe to assume that 
a number of those pleasures involve 
the use of form-changes?” 

“It certainly would. We know 
there are illegal form-changes going ' 
on there, for some of the more de- 
bauched physical tastes. But we’ve | 
never had trouble with them, and ' 
they are very discreet. We keep a | 
kind of informal truce. I don’t have j 
to tell you, Mr. Ling, how much 
power the managers of Pleasure 
Dome have when it comes to silent | 
influence in high places.” 

Ling touched the map display 
control and a new image appeared. 
“Then this must be our next | 
stop — Cap City and Pleasure Dome. 

We still have not answered the 
basic question: how did those three 
men become three dead monsters? 

Mr. Green, you should remain here ; 
and be available to answer the in- ^ 
quiries from Earth and Moon au- 
thorities. Please make travel ar- 
rangements now for Mr. Wolf and 
myself. Don’t worry, Mr. Wolf,” ! 
he added, seeing Bey’s questioning I 
look. “1 can call on the full fman- j 
cial resources of the U.S.F. in pur- | 
suing this enquiry.” i 



18 



GALAXY 



“That’s not my worry at the 
moment, Mr. Ling. I was wonder- 
ing why the Mariana Trench was 
chosen to dispose of the bodies. 
Can you explain that also?” 

“I have a speculation, certainly. 
After the crew of the ‘Jason’ died, I 
think the proprietors of Pleasure 
Dome looked at their identifications 
and realized they were in trouble. 
They know the U.S.F. looks after 
its own. The plan was to get the 
bodies off-Earth. They were taken 
to Australia through the Mattin 
Link. When the Pleasure Dome 
people found that security regula- 
tions on space access are very tight, 
that plan was dropped and they 
were forced to improvise. One fur- 
ther transfer through the Link Sys- 
tem took them to the Marianas. 
Hasty planning — and an inadequate 
knowledge of local geography — led 
to a ’ootching of the disposal job.” 
Ling looked pleased with his 
analysis. ‘‘It is only a deductive ar- 
gument, 1 admit. But 1 suspect it 
has a very high probability of being 
right. 

“Now, quickly, have prepara- 
tions made and let us be on our 
way.” 

Green hurried out, but Wolf 
lingered a moment. Ling looked at 
him questioningly. 

‘‘You have further business, Mr. 
Wolf? I have a great deal of work 
still to do on the records and not 
much time to do it.” 

Bey nodded. “1 want to make 
one comment. I’ve spent my life 
studying form-change, and I believe 
I understand it as well as anyone. 
One man is my master in the 
theory, but when it comes to seeing 
through exterior changes 1 match 



myself against anyone. 1 believe 
that we have met before, Mr. Ling, 
and under very different cir- 
cumstances. I do not propose to do 
anything about it, but I want you to 
know that I can tell the lion by his 
paw.” 

Karl Ling’s acid look seemed to 
soften briefly. Bey Wolf thought 
there was the trace of a smile on his 
lips. “I’m sorry, Mr. Wolf, but I 
really have no idea what you are 
talking about. Would you please let 
me get down to this biological 
work — help me, if you wish. 1 want 
to be in Cap City four hours from 
now.” 

* ★ ★ 

After Bey Wolf and Karl Ling 
had left. Park Green and John Lar- 
sen went for a drink and a sharing 
of dissatisfaction. By the third one 
Larsen had become more morose 
and militant. 

“Just our luck. Those two go off 
to sample Pleasure Dome and leave 
us here to handle the brainless 
bureaucrats,” he complained. “It’s 
always the same, we get all the dog 
work, they get all the excitement.” 

He had never met or heard of 
Ling until that day, but fine points 
of logic were beneath him. 

“I’d like to show those two,” he 
went on. “I’d like to show them 
what we can do without them. 
Solve this whole thing while they’re 
gone.” He slid a little lower in his 
seat. “That would show them.” 

Green and Larsen had been going 
drink for drink, but with twice the 
body mass Green was in much bet- 
ter shape. He watched Larsen sink 
lower yet.

“Come on,” he said. “Let’s do 
it.’’ He lifted the limp figure of 
Larsen easily to a standing position 
and held him there while he paid 
the bill. “Just let’s get a shot of 
de-toxer in you and we’ll be all 
set. Let’s go and work over the full 
records and see if we can come up 
with something new. It would do 
me a lot of good to beat that 
smarmy supercilious midget to the 
answer.” 

Fifteen minutes later they were 
both cold sober and deep into the 
case records. 

There was a long period of sifting 
before John Larsen sat back, looked 
up at the ceiling for a spell and fi- 
nally said: 

“Question: what is there about 
the crew of the ‘Jason’ that made 
them very unusual? Answer: they 
had recently been handling large 
quantities of transuranic elements, 
probably experiencing high levels of 
radioactivity. So here is my second 
question: did the autopsies look for 
radioactivity in the bodies? My bet 
is that they didn’t. So, final ques- 
tion: is what happened the effects of 
transuranic elements in their central 
nervous systems? 1 doubt if anyone 
knows what a substantial amount of 
transuranics could do. It’s a long 
shot, but it’s a new line.” 

Green shrugged. “It’s a long 
shot, but we should check it. Do 
you know where the bodies are 
now?’ ’ 

“In the Form Control center in 
Manila.” 

Green stood up. “Come on. 
We’ll need authorization for another 
autopsy and a pathologist.”

The exit point from the Mattin 
Link system is in the upper levels 
of Cap City, almost at the surface 
itself. Bey Wolf and Karl Ling 
came out of the Link and looked 
about them for the elevators that 
would take them down to Pleasure 
E)ome, four thousand feet below in 
the polar ice. As they stood there, a 
soft voice spoke in their ears: 

‘Come to Pleasure Dome, satisfy 
your heart’s desires.’ 

Ling looked at Wolf and smiled. 
“An Omni projector. What a waste 
of a technology. We’d give millions 
for that system in Tycho Base.” 

The soft voice continued. ‘In 
Pleasure Dome, you can shed the 
cares of the world and feel free 
again. Visit the Caves of Ice and 
swim in the Pool of Lethe. Win a 
world in the great Xanadu Casino, 
or spend a day as part of the Cou- 
pling Loom. Be free, be with us in 
Pleasure Dome.’ 

Free, at a price, thought Wolf, as 
the Omni advertising went on. Fi- 
nally, a useful comment came. 

‘Follow the blue lights to the 
temple of earthly delights. ’ 
Following the blue lights as di- 
rected, they were soon dropping 
swiftly, deep into the polar cap. 
The entrance to Pleasure Dome was 
a great sparkling chamber, lined 
with perfect mirrors, like the inside 
of a giant multi-faceted diamond. 
The effect was shattering. Walls, 
floor and ceiling were all perfectly 
reflective. Images of the room 
marched off to infinity in every di- 
rection. Bey looked about him, 
struggling to orient himself. 

“Better get used to it, Mr. 
Wolf,” remarked Ling coolly. 
“Pleasure Dome is all like this.” 



20 



GALAXY 



“I didn’t realize you’d been here 
before.” 

“Long ago. These walls are a 
necessity, not a luxury, you know. 
When they cut this city beneath the 
ice cap, twenty years ago, the big 
problem was the heat. People pro- 
duce heat, from themselves and 
their equipment. The ice walls 
would have melted in no time. 
These walls — all the walls in Plea- 
sure Dome — are coated with 
Passivine. It’s perfectly reflecting 
and has a very low coefficient of 
thermal conductivity. A negligible 
amount of heat passes through to 
the ice walls, and a modest refriger- 
ation system takes care of that eas- 
ily.” 

Bey looked at Karl Ling ironi- 
cally. “For one who is from off- 
Earth, Mr. Ling, you have an amaz- 
ing knowledge of Earth affairs.” 

“The long lunar nights give us 
plenty of time for reading.” There 
was a definite hint of humor in 
Ling’s formal reply. Before Bey 
could comment further, a third per- 
son had joined them. 

“Welcome to Pleasure Dome, 
Sirs.” The speaker was a tall 
woman dressed all in white. Her 
skin was pale and flawless, her hair 
a fine white cloud. She looked at 
them quietly with cool grey eyes. A 
Snow Queen. Bey wondered how 
much of it was natural, and how 
much she owed to form-change. 

“1 will be your hostess and help 
you to arrange your pleasures. Do 
not be afraid to ask, whatever your 
tastes. There are few wishes that we 
cannot accommodate. Before we 
begin, there are a few formalities.” 

“You want our identifications?” 
asked Bey. 



“Only if you wish to give them. 
Sirs. We do need proof of adequate 
means, but that may be cash if you 
prefer to use it.” 

“We are together,” said Ling. 
“My credit will serve for both. E)o 
you have a bank connection?” 
“Here, Sir.” The Snow Queen 
produced a small silver box, onto 
which Ling placed his right index 
finger. In a few seconds, the l.D. 
was established and the central bank 
returned a credit rating. As she read 
the credit, the Snow Queen lost her 
composure for the first time and be- 
came a young woman. Bey sus- 
pected that Ling’s credit rating was 
that of the entire U.S.F. 

“What is your pleasure. Sirs?” 
Even her voice seemed changed. It 
was now uncertain, nervous, almost 
childish. With that much credit 
available, Bey realized, there was 
nothing, literally nothing, that could 
not be bought at Pleasure Dome. 
That included the body or soul of 
their hostess, and she knew it. It 
was dangerous to be in contact with 
such financial power. She could 
never know when one of Ling’s 
whims might include her as a pur- 
chased pleasure. 

Ling’s businesslike manner 
helped to reassure her. “We want 
to talk to the man who controls the 
form-change tanks. The one who 
handled the three off-worlders re- 
cently. Don’t worry, you may not 
know what I’m referring to, but he 
certainly will.” 

She hesitated. Ling’s request fell 
far outside the usual list of fancies. 
“One moment. Sirs.” 

She slipped quietly out through a 
glittering arch. Karl Ling looked at 
Bey quizzically.

“I thought the direct approach 
would be best,” Ling said. “If 
necessary, can you threaten these 
people enough to make them 
worried — say you’ll close down 
their illegal form-change services if 
they don’t cooperate?” 

“1 can threaten ail right — but I’m 
not sure what I can really do if the 
threats don’t work. With any luck 
they won’t want to find out either.” 
The Snow Queen had brought 
reinforcements. An equally striking 
blond haired man, again dressed in 
white. 

“Sirs, your credit is enough to 
purchase any pleasure,” he began. 
“But certain things in Pleasure 
Dome are not available at any price. 
The detail of our operations is one. 
Please state your wishes again, so 
that we can see if we are able to 
accommodate them.” 

“We have no intention of causing 
trouble here,” replied Ling. “But if 
we wished to do so there is no 
doubt that we could. This is 
Behrooz Wolf, the head of Form 
Control for Earth. I am Karl Ling, 
special assistant to the U.S.F. 
Cabinet. All we are looking for is 
information. Three men died re- 
cently during form-change. We be- 
lieve that they died here. We want 
to speak to the man in charge of 
that operation, and we want to see 
the full records of the monitors that 
were recording and supervising the 
form-changes.” 

The man made no attempt to 
deny the charge. He was silent for a 
few moments, then asked; 

“If we cooperate, you will take 
our involvement no further, here or 
elsewhere?’ ’ 

“You have our word.” 



“Then come with me.” The 
blond man smiled. “You should be 
pleased. You are obtaining a service 
free of charge. To my knowledge, 
this has never happened before 
since Pleasure Dome was first 
created.” 

The three men walked through a 
maze of ice caves, fairy grottoes lit 
by lights of different colors, and 
came at last to a door that led to an 
ordinary office with panelled walls 
and a functional looking desk. 

He motioned to them to sit down. 

“I will return in a moment. This, 
by the way, is the luxury that we 
aspire to in Pleasure Dome — normal 
walls and furniture, and privacy. 
Our lives here rarely permit us 
either.” 

He returned a few minutes later 
with his identical twin. That seemed 
to answer Bey’s question about the 
use of form-change on Pleasure 
Dome staff. The ultimate bondage: 
someone else dictated the shape of 
their bodies. 

Ling wanted the man to be at 
ease and displayed a new side of his 
personality — warmth and kindness. 
Bey noted it and marked up one 
more data point on a growing list. 
The examination began. The man 
was at first ill-at-ease, but soon re- 
laxed and became more talkative. 

“All those three wanted was a 
full-speed reconditioning program. 
The only thing we did for them here 
that is in any way illegal was the 
speed. We used the bio-feedback 
machines twenty-four hours a day, 
and provided nutrients intraven- 
ously. So it looked like a com- 
pletely straightforward request and 
we didn’t give them any special 
monitoring, the way we would if a 



22 



GALAXY 



customer was to come in and ask 
for a special change. The full pro- 
gram they’d asked for takes about a 
hundred and fifty hours, nearly a 
week of changing if you run it con- 
tinuously, the way we do.” 

“You’ve run this course many 
times before?” asked Ling. 

“Often, especially for off- 
worlders. Of course, we never ask 
their origins, but we can make a 
guess from clothing and speech. 
Since Capman’s form-change work, 
a straightforward program like this 
has been completely automatic. The 
tank has automatic monitors that 
control air supply and nutrient sup- 
ply and regulate the pace of the 
process. The subject has to be con- 
scious at some level, since it is pur- 
posive form-change that’s involved. 
But the unit’s completely self- 
contained and the only way we 
know what’s happening inside the 
tank is through looking at the auto- 
matic monitor tell-tales on the out- 
side.” 

“And how often do you do 
that?” 

“In a simple case like this, once 
a day. We never have anything to 
do, but we check anyway. In the 
case of these three off-worlders, 
they all began at the same time and 
they all asked for the same recondi- 
tioning program. Needed it, too. 
They looked done in when they ar- 
rived here. 

“The evening of the third day, 1 
took my routine look at the tell- 
tales. All three men were dead. I 
couldn’t believe it. At first 1 sus- 
pected the tell-tales were lying, or 
there’d been a programming error, 
or something. Then we opened the 
tanks. God, it was awful. Like a 



nightmare. They had changed, they 
weren’t men anymore. They were 
monsters, with great glowing eyes 
and thick skin, like a horror holo. 
We confirmed that they were dead, 
then we looked at their I.D.’s and 
realized they were off-worlders. 
Then everybody around here really 
panicked, and we tried to get them 
off-Earth. When we found we 
couldn’t do that, we tried to put 
them deep at sea. That apparently 
failed too.” 

The man fell silent and there was 
a long pause. 

Ling was too engrossed even to 
give Bey Wolf a look of triumph. 
He was bound in a spell of concen- 
tration so intense that he looked 
blind, his eyes unblinking and fo- 
cused on infinity. 

“Did you do any chemical 
analyses of the bodies?” he asked. 

“God, no. We wanted to get 
them out of here. But there will be 
records on the tapes that were made 
by the monitors and tell-tales, and 
there should be continuous monitor- 
ing of some cell chemistry and 
blood chemistry.” 

“Right. 1 want to examine those 
now. Bring them here or take me to 
them.” 

“We’ll get them. But they’ll be 
in raw form. Only a form-change 
expert can read them.” 

Ling caught Bey Wolf’s look. 
“Bring them in. We’ll manage 
somehow,” he said. “It’s a skill 
you never lose once you’ve mas- 
tered it completely.”

John Larsen looked at the spec- 
trograph output, then at Park Green.

“It’s not as much as I expected,” 
he said. “But there are traces of 
Asfanium in all three bodies. 
There’s slight radioactivity because 
of that, but it’s not enough to make 
a strong physical effect. 1 wonder, 
do you think that it could be a 
chemical effect of Asfanium that 
did it? We don’t have a good un- 
derstanding of that aspect of the 
transuranics in the island of stability 
up around element 114.” 

“That’s quite possible,” Green 
replied. “You know, we are still 
doing a lot of work on Asfanium 
and Folium and are finding some 
odd chemical properties, up in 
Lunar Base. One other thing occurs 
to me, the crew of the ‘Jason’ had 
never encountered form-change be- 
fore. Do you think that they let 
things get out of control, maybe, 
due to their inexperience? TTien they 
ran into something new, like the ef- 
fect of a trace of Asfanium?” 

Larsen slapped the spectrogram 
output sheet against his thigh. 
“Park, I bet you’re on to some- 
thing. With inexperienced people in 
purposive form-change, anything 
might happen. Now, we can test 
that. Asfanium concentrates in the 
thymus gland. If we take an extract 
from one of these three, we can 
conduct a controlled test and see if 
there is a tendency to form-change 
the way they did.” 

Park Green frowned. “1 didn’t 
realize you had suitable test ani- 
mals. Isn’t it true that humans alone 
can achieve purposive form-change? 
After all, that’s the basis of the hu- 
manity tests.” 

Larsen laughed confidently. 
“Exactly right. You want to see the 
test animal? Here it is.” He tapped 



himself on the chest. “Now, don’t 
get the wrong idea,” he added, as 
Park Green began a horrified pro- 
test. “One of the things we get in 
Form Control is many years of 
training in form-control methods. If 
anything starts to happen. I’ll have 
no trouble stopping it and reversing 
it. Don’t forget, it’s a purposive 
process. Come on, let’s get a 
thymus gland extract made here and 
then back to the form-change tanks 
at Headquarters. We’ll really have 
something to show Bey and your 
boss when they get back.” 

it it it 

The jaunt to Pleasure Dome was 
becoming a grind. The staff em- 
ployees looked on in amazement as 
Wolf and Ling worked their way 
through the monitor tapes at express 
speed, reading raw data, swapping 
comments and analyses as they 
went. The tapes contained a mixture 
of body physical parameters, such 
as subject temperature, pulse rate 
and skin conductivity, with nutrient 
rates. Programs in use as they were 
swapped in and out of the tank con- 
trol computer, plus chemical read- 
ings and brain activity, were re- 
corded in parallel on the same tape. 
Reading one required many years of 
experience, plus a full understand- 
ing of the processes — mental and 
physical — of the human body. Ling 
was tireless, and Bey was deter- 
mined not to be outdone. 

“Who is he?” whispered the 
Pleasure Dome form-change super- 
visor to Bey, at one of their brief 
halts. “I know you are head of 
Form Control, but where did he 
learn all this?” 



24 



GALAXY 



Bey looked across at Ling, who 
was deep in thought and probably 
would not have noticed an explo- 
sion in the room. 

“Maybe you should ask him 
yourself. I’ve had that conversation 
already.’’ 

Then more tapes arrived and the 
question was pushed aside. 

After thirty-six hours of intense 
work, the basic analysis was com- 
plete. They had an incredible array 
of facts available to them, but one 
of them dominated all others. The 
crew of the ‘Jason’ had died well 
before their form-change was com- 
plete. They had died because the 
forms they were becoming were un- 
able to live in and breathe normal 
air. The final form they would have 
become remained unknown. The rea- 
son why they were changing to 
those forms, under the control of a 
reconditioning program that had 
been used successfully a thousand 
times before, was equally unknown. 

Karl Ling sat motionless, as he 
had for the previous two hours. Oc- 
casionally he would ask Bey a ques- 
tion, or look again at a piece of 
data. Rather than disturb him Bey 
decided that he would go into 
another room to call back to Head- 
quarters and check with John Larsen 
on the general situation. Ling was 
voyaging on strange seas of 
thought, alone, and Bey Wolf had 
developed a profound respect for 
Karl Ling. 

Park Green answered the com- 
municator instead of Larsen. He 
looked very uncomfortable. 

“Where’s John?” 

“He’s been in a form-change 
tank since yesterday morning.” 

To Green’s great relief, Bey Wolf 



didn’t seem at all concerned. Even 
when he had explained the whole 
story to Bey, the latter seemed in- 
terested but not at all worried. 

“John’s been around form-change 
equipment for a long time. He 
knows how to handle it as well as 
anyone on Earth. But honestly. 
Park, I’m sceptical about his theory. 
Why, injured Belters have been 
using form-change equipment for 
years. They call it regeneration 
equipment. But it’s the same thing 
exactly. It’s only form-change to 
forms that are not your original 
shape that are illegal to off- 
Earthers.” 

Park Green looked as though a 
big weight had been lifted off him. 

“Thank God for that. I thought I 
might have let John talk me into a 
deal where he was taking a big risk. 

I don’t know enough about all this 
to argue with him. I’ll go off to the 
tanks, and see how things are com- 
ing along there.” 

Bey smiled at the honesty of the 
big man’s concern for Larsen and 
signed off. He strolled back to join 
Ling, who had now come out of his 
trance and accepted a cup of syn- 
caff, ‘compliments of Pleasure 
Dome.’ Having let them in free of 
charge, the st^f of Pleasure Dome 
seemed to have adopted them. Ling 
had just politely refused a Snow 
Queen’s offer of an age-old 
technique to relax him after all his 
hard work. He seemed mildly an- 
noyed when she made the same 
offer to Bey. 

“1 think I have it, Mr. Wolf, and 
it’s fascinating. More than I 
dreamed. If I’m right, this is a spe- 
cial day in history.” He sat back, 
relishing the moment.

“Well, Park Green and John Lar- 
sen think they have it too,” said 
Bey. “I just had video contact with 
them.” 

“They do? Without the evidence 
that we have here?” Ling was 
openly surprised. “What do they 
believe it is?” 

Bey sketched out Larsen's theory, 
and summarized the situation back 
in Headquarters. He mentioned fi- 
nally that Larsen was putting it to a 
practical test. 

“Larsen injected an extract from 
one of the dead men, and got into a 
form-change tank?” Ling’s self- 
possession had failed him, and he 
had turned white. “He’s a dead 
man. God, why didn’t they consult 
us here?” 

He sprang to his feet, hurled the 
papers to one side and grabbed his 
Jacket. 

“Come, Mr. Wolf. We have to 
get back to Headquarters as fast as 
we possibly can. If there is a 
chance now to save John Larsen’s 
life, it depends on our efforts.” 

He ran out of the room. Bey 
Wolf, bewildered and alarmed, fol- 
lowed him at top speed. When Karl 
Ling lost his dignity so completely, 
it was time to worry indeed. 

* * * 

In the elevator, on ground trans- 
port and through the Mattin Link, 
Ling explained the basics of his dis- 
coveries to Bey Wolf. By the time 
they reached Headquarters it was 
hard to say which man was the 
more frantic. They went at once to 
the form-change tanks. 

Park Green, alerted as they 
travelled, was waiting for them 



there. He looked at Ling in trepida- 
tion, expecting an outburst of insult 
and accusation. It did not come. 
Ling went at once to the tank con- 
taining John Larsen and began to 
read the tell-tales. After a couple of 
minutes he grunted with satisfac- 
tion. 

“So far everything is stable. If he 
follows the same pattern as the 
others, we have about twenty-four 
hours to do something for him. The 
one thing I daren’t do is stop this 
process in the middle. We’ll have to 
let the process run its course, keep 
him alive while it happens, and 
worry afterwards about reversing it. 
Bring me the tank schematics. I 
need to know how the circuits that 
control the nutrients and air supply 
work for this model.” 

Park Green went for them and 
came back in bewilderment. He 
took Bey Wolf to one side after he 
had given the schematics to Ling. 

“Mr. Wolf, does he know what 
he’s doing? He’s a Loge expert, he 
doesn’t know about this stuff, does 
he? Are we risking John’s life by 
letting him do this?” 

Wolf put his hand up on Green’s | 
shoulder. “Park, believe me he j 
does know what he’s doing. If any- { 
one can help John now, he can. 
Let’s help all we can here. I’ll tell 
you what my view is when this is 
all over.” 

Ling interrupted their conversa- 
tion. His voice had a reassuring au- 
thority and certainty. “One of you | 
come over here and make a note of 
the equipment changes we have to 
put on diis tank. I’ll read off set- 
tings as I find them on the charts. 
The other one of you, call BEC. I 
want their top man on interactive

form-change programs. Ramo Wold 
if he’s still with them, the best one 
they have if he isn’t. Top priority. 
Tell them it’s codeword circuits, if 
that’ll move them faster.” 

The equipment modification be- 
gan. At every stage. Ling rechecked 
the tell-tales. Larsen’s condition in- 
side the tank remained stable, but 
there were definite changes occur- 
ring. Pulse rate was down, and 
there was heavy demand on calcium 
and sodium in the nutrient supply. 
Skin properties were changing dras- 
tically. 

I “They would have noticed all 
1 this in Pleasure Dome if they’d 
i have looked closely,” grunted Ling, 
j “Give them their due, they had no 
reason in the world to expect any- 
thing peculiar. But look at that body 
mass indicator. It’s up to a hundred 
kilos. What’s Larsen’s usual 
weight?” 

“Eighty.” Bey was absorbed, 
watching the indicators. He longed 
to see inside the tank but there was 
no provision for that in the system. 

After many hours of equipment 
change and work on program mod- 
ification with the BEC program en- 
gineer, Ling finally declared that he 
' had done all he could. The real test 
i would come in a few hours’ time. 
The records of the crew of the ‘Ja- 
son’ had begun to go wild then. It 
remained to be seen if the equip- 
! ment changes would keep Larsen’s 
' condition stable as the change pro- 
ceeded further. 

J As Ling made the final checks on 
' the tell-tales, Bey realized the men- 
I tal anguish and confusion that Park 
Green was going through. 

“Mr. Ling, have we done all we 
I can here?” Bey asked. 



“For the moment. The rest is 
waiting.” 

“Then if you will, for my benefit 
and Mr. Green’s, I would ap- 
preciate it if you would explain this 
to us, from the beginning. I got a 
quick overview on the way here, 
but Park is still in the dark.” 

Ling looked at Green as though 
seeing him for the first time. He fi- 
nally nodded sympathetically. 

“From the beginning, eh? Well, 
that’s a long story and I’ll have to 
tell it the way I imagine it. Whether 
it is true or not is another matter.” 

He sat down and put his hands 
behind his head. 

“It begins sixteen million years 
ago, on the planet Loge. Loge was 
a giant, about ninety earth masses, 
and Loge was going to explode. 
Now for something you may find 
hard to accept. Loge had living on 
it a race of intelligent beings. 
Perhaps too intelligent. Maybe they 
were the reason that their planet dis- 
integrated. We’ll probably never 
know that. 

“The race had nuclear energy, 
but not spaceflight. How do I know 
that? Well, 1 know they had nuclear 
energy because they made trans- 
uranic elements. Any natural source 
of transuranics would have decayed 
by natural process in the past sev- 
eral billion years since the creation 
of the Solar System. The only way 
we could have a source of trans- 
uranics on Loge — and only on 
Loge — would be if they were being 
created there, by nuclear transmuta- 
tion. We can’t do that efficiently 
yet, so there’s good reason to be- 
lieve the Logians had an advanced 
nuclear technology — more than we 
have today. 



LEGACY

“How do I know they didn’t 
have spaceflight? That’s harder. The 
main reason: they couldn’t get off 
Loge, even though they knew it was 
going to disintegrate. They must 
have had some years’ warning and 
time to plan, so 1 imagine it wasn’t 
a nuclear war. Perhaps they had 
found a way of making large-scale 
interior adjustments to the planet, 
and lost control. Again, we’ll never 
know. 

“They looked around them in the 
Solar System. They were going to 
die, personally, but was there a way 
their race might survive? To a Lo- 
gian, the natural place for the survi- 
val of the race would be Jupiter or 
Saturn. They probably never even 
thought of Earth, a tiny planet, too 
hot, oxygen atmosphere, a metal 
ball crouched too near the Sun. No, 
Jupiter or Saturn was their hope. 
That’s where they turned those big 
luminous eyes — adapted for life in a 
methane-heavy atmosphere. 

“Their scientists calculated the 
force of the explosion and gave a 
grim report. No life form, even sin- 
gle celled ones, could survive it. 
Parts of Loge would be thrown in 
all directions. Some would undoubt- 
edly hit Jupiter and its satellites — 
and Earth too. Could anything sur- 
vive that transit? 

“If anything could, it would be a 
virus. There’s no ‘life-support sys- 
tem’ in a virus, it’s just a chunk of 
DNA. To grow and multiply, it 
needs a host cell. The Logians took 
a chance, and packed their genetic 
material as a viral form. 

“Maybe it worked. We’ve never 
had a ship down to the surface of 
Jupiter or Saturn, and perhaps there 
are Logians down there, created by 



viral growth of Loge genetic mate- 
rial in host bodies. We do know 
there are no Logians on the satel- 
lites of either planet. 

“Some of feat viral material was 
on fragments of Loge that were 
blown far out and became part of 
the long-period comets. That didn’t 
matter. A virus lasts indefinitely. 
Sixteen million years later, some of 
those fragments fell back into the 
Solar System and men began min- 
ing them — not for their Loge DNA, 
not at all. For their transuranic ele- 
ments. 

“Humans are very poor hosts for 
Loge development. The Loge virus 
could get into the human body eas- 
ily enough, and even take up resi- 
dence in the central nervous system. 
But it couldn’t thrive in such un- 
familiar surroundings. Wrong at- 
mosphere, wrong chemical balance, 
wrong shape.’’ 

Ling paused and looked at the 
other two. He had ceased to be the 
irritating special advisor and be- 
come the great scientist, lecturing to 
an audience of laymen. 

“You may find it hard to believe, 
but 1 was already convinced of the 
existence of a Loge civilization be- 
fore I ever came to Earth for this 
investigation. The transuranic ele- 
ments proved it, to my satisfaction. 
Otherwise 1 would never have been 
led down this train of thought so 
quickly. 

“The crew of the ‘Jason’ picked 
up Loge DNA from the Logian 
fragment. Nothing happened. TTien 
they came to Earth and got into the 
form-change machines; and at last 
the virus could begin to act. It 
stimulated their central nervous sys- , 
terns, and the purposive form- 



28 



GALAXY 



change began to create a form that 
was optimal — for Logians, not for 
Earthmen. When that change had 
proceeded to the point where the 
changed form could not survive in 
the atmosphere of Earth, the crea- 
tures died. Asphyxiated, in normal 
air.” 

Park Green was now looking in 
horror at the tank containing John 
Larsen. 

“Does that mean that will happen 
to John, too?” 

“It would have. He injected him- 
self with Loge DNA, along with the 
Asfanium. The work we’ve been 
doing this past day has been to 
modify the life-support system of 
the tank, so that it follows the needs 
of the organism inside it. If you go 
and look at the tell-tales now, you’ll 
find that the nutrients and the at- 
mosphere are ones that would kill a 



human.” 

Park Green hurried over to the 
tank. He looked quickly at the 
monitors and came back. 

“Body mass, one hundred and 
sixty kilos. Oxygen down to eight 
percent. Mr. Ling, will John live?” 

“I believe he will. Can we ever 
return him to the shape of John Lar- 
sen? That is a harder question. If 
we can, I suspect that it will not be 
for some time.” 

Karl Ling looked at Bey Wolf 
and caught a reflection of his own 
excitement. 

“We must look on the positive 
side,” he said. “We’ve dreamed 
for centuries about our first meeting 
with an alien race.” He nodded to- 
wards the tank. “The first represen- 
tative will be in that tank, ready to 
meet with us, a day or two from 
now.” ★ 




LEGACY

Part II of IV 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

K.EILA JEDRIK, a youtig Human 
female, has known only the desperate 
survival battle on the planet Dosadi 
where she lives a double life: in one 
persona a minor bureaucrat supervis- 
ing food distribution; in the other per- 
sona a secret warlord waiting to fidfill 
the function for which she was bred 
and trained. Her mandate is to lead 
rebellion against Dosadi’s imprison- 
ment, for this is no ordinary planet 
linked to all the other sentient federa- 
tions in the ConSentiency. Dosadi is 
locked behind a barrier ‘God Wall’ 
which dims its sun and isolates it from 
the rest of the universe. 

Dosadi’s two species, the frog-like 
Gowachin and the Humans, are de- 
scended from a population which sub- 
mitted to memory erasure after volun- 
teering to participate in a massive 
long-term psychological experiment. 
The descendants are supposed to be- 
lieve themselves alone in the universe. 
But the ancestors who bred for Keila 
Jedrik knew they were puppets dancing 
to outside whims and they saw that 
Dosadi was a hell, its plants and ani- 
mals poison to both Human and 
Gowachin unless raised in hydroponic 
isolation. 

The Dosadis know only the city of 
Chu where the food is relatively pure 
and the Rim where people are 
condemned to a teeming scramble for 
short existence. 

While Jedrik sets the stage for re- 
bellion, other forces muster in the 
ConSentiency. 

The Bureau of Sabotage, a 
sophisticated ombudsman-like ministry 
in the ConSentient government, has 



discovered that there is such a place as 
Dosadi and that unidentified Gowachin 
are behind it. Dosadi’s location and 
the precise nature of the experiment 
are not known, but BuSab learns that 
a Caleban is involved. 

Calebans, seen as stars in this uni- 
verse, provide the ConSentiency with 
jumpdoors. Through a jumpdoor, you 
can walk in one step from planet to 
planet. Calebans, called the “S’Eye 
People,” have been a nagging mystery 
for many generations. Either through 
design or semantic confusion, the 
Calebans have never explained how 
Jumpdoors work. This is a mystery on 
a l^ger scale but similar to the Con- 
Sentient involvement with Taprisiots, 
the stubby, logdike beings who provide 
instant mind-to-mind communications 
linkages across the parsecs. 

BuSab Agent Jorj X. McKie is as- 
signed to solve the Dosadi problem by 
Bureau Chief Bildoon, a member of 
the PanSpechi species who ape Human 
form but can pass one ego from person 
to person in a creche-family. 

McKie knows there is time pressure, 
that the Gowachin may obliterate 
Dosadi to conceal what they have 
done. 

Summoned to the Gowachin home 
planet of Tandaloor, the place of 
their mythological progenitor, Mrreg, 
McKie is confronted by Aritch, High 
M agister of the most important 
Gowachin Phylum, and by a deadly 
Wreave female, representative of one 
of the many other species in the Con- 
Sentiency. The Wreave shows by her 
myriad cheek pocks that she is linked 
to countless breeding triads of her 
species. McKie knows that if he 
offends her, he risks vendetta with all 
of that gigantic extended family. The 
Wreave, Ceylang by name, is being 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



31 



trained as a Legum, an adept in 
Gowachin Law. McKie is the only liv- 
ing non-Gowachin who has achieved 
Legum status. 

Aritch places the binding oath upon 
McKie, who now must represent the 
High Magister in any Gowachin legal 
action. In doing this, Aritch puts in 
McKie’s hands the Phylum box con- 
taining three sacred objects: a book, a 
knife and a rock. The book on ageless 
metal defines origins of Gowachin 
Law; the rock is for pounding on wood 
to call a Courtarena into session; the 
knife is to be used by the winning 
Legum to slay the loser. 

McKie stops the W reave from attack- 
ing him by revealing knowledge of 
other Gowachin sacred matters. 
Ceylang, frustrated, is warned by 
McKie that unless she sheds her 
Wreave skin she will never be a true 
Legum. 

These facts emerge: 

Dosadi’s imprisoned millions are in- 
creasingly immune to memory erasure 
and are, in Gowachin eyes, ‘mon- 
strous’ for reasons Aritch does not ex- 
plain. 

The Dosadis submit to a quasi- 
religious government under an Elector 
named Broey, who is a Gowachin of 
oddly Human habits and mannerisms. 

Anything is for sale on Dosadi- 
secret information, bodies, temporary 
protection, virtually unlimited services, 
food, armies. 

Broey is served by a pair of Human 
warlords. Gar and Gar’s daughter, 
Tria. This pair has a secret connection 
(which Jedrik knows) with attempts to 
start another city on Dosadi, an act 
proscribed by Broey ’s Convocation of 
the Heavenly Veil. 

Jedrik’s chauffeur, Havvy, tells her 
that a Jorj X. McKie is being sent in 



from the Rim, an infiltrator. Through 
her superb contacts with the Rim and 
intern^ espionage within the city, Jed- 
rik knows McKie comes from off 
planet. He is the key she needs to open 
the God WaU! 

Unknown to Jedrik, McKie carries 
the sophisticated tools of his employ- 
ment, highly dangerous weapons, plus 
a Taprisiot linkage which, should he 
be killed, is supposed to provide the 
next BuSab agent with all information 
McKie has learned up to the moment 
of death. 

Havvy tries to sell more information 
to Jedrik. She knows Havvy wasn’t 
born on Dosadi, that he was a flawed 
instrument, coming to her too late to 
use against the God Wall. She hates 
the powers of ‘X’ who have imprisoned 
Dosadi, but conceals this. Jedrik 
places her reliance on a simulation 
model of each person who opposes her 
(including Broey), a model she carries 
in her head and which enables her to 
anticipate her foes. She also has come 
to realize that Havvy and the others 
like him, these non-Dosadis who 
govern her planet, are dolts. When 
Havvy tells her McKie comes from be- 
yond the God Wall, it is too much. She 
already knew this, that McKie was 
walking into her trap. Havvy seemingly 
cannot learn the Dosadi lessons of 
concealment and personal hardness. 
He will have to die. Such incompe- 
tence cannot be permitted to breed. 

All persons act from beliefs they 
are conditioned not to question, 
from a set of deeply seated pre- 
judices. Therefore, whoever pre- 
sumes to judge must be asked: 
‘How are you affronted?’ And this 
judge must begin there to ques-

tion inwardly as well as out- 
wardly. 

— The Question’ 
from Ritual of the Courtarena 
Guide to Servants of the Box 



“One might suspect you of trying 
to speak under water,” McKie ac- 
cused. 

He still sat opposite Aritch in the 
High Magister’s sanctus and this 
near-insult was only one indicator 
marking the changed atmosphere be- 
tween them. The sun had dropped 
closer to the horizon and its 
spiritual ring no longer outlined 
Aritch’s head. The two of them 
were being more direct now, if not 
more candid, having explored indi- 
vidual capacities and found where 
profitable discourse might be di- 
rected. 

The High Magister flexed his 
thigh tendons. 

Knowing these people from long 
and close observation, McKie re- 
alized the old Gowachin was in pain 
from prolonged inactivity. That was 
an advantage to be exploited. 
McKie held up his left hand, enum- 
erated on his fingers: 

“You say the original volunteers 
on Dosadi submitted to memory 
erasure, but many of their descen- 
dants are immune to such erasure. 
The present population knows 
nothing about our ConSentient 
Universe.” 

“As far as the present Dosadi 
population comprehends, they are 
the only people on the only inhabi- 
ted planet in existence.” 

McKie found this hard to believe. 
He held up a third finger. 



Aritch stared with distaste at the 
displayed hand. There were no webs 
between the alien fingers! 

McKie said: “And you tell me 
that a DemoPol backed up by cer- 
tain religious injunctions is the 
primary tool of government there?” 
“An original condition of our ex- 
periment,” Aritch said. 

It was not a comprehensive an- 
swer, McKie observed. Original 
conditions invariably changed. 
McKie decided to come back to this 
after the High Magister had submit- 
ted to more muscle pain. 

“Do the Dosadi know the nature 
of the Caleban barrier which en- 
closes them?” 

“They’ve tried rocket probes, 
primitive electromagnetic projec- 
tions. They understand that those 
energies they can produce will not 
penetrate their ‘God Wall.’ ” 

“Is that what they call the bar- 
rier?” 

“That or ‘The Heavenly Veil.’ 
To some degree, these labels mea- 
sure their attitude toward the bar- 
rier.” 

“The DemoPol can serve many 
governmental forms,” McKie said. 
“What’s the basic form of their 
government?” 

Aritch considered this, then: 

“The form varies. They’ve em- 
ployed some eighty different 
governmental forms.” 

Another non-responsive answer. 
Aritch did not like to face the fact 
that their experiment had assumed 
warlord trappings. McKie thought 
about the DemoPol. In the hands of 
adepts and with a population re- 
sponsive to the software probes by 
which the computer data was as- 
sembled, the DemoPol represented 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



33 



an ultimate tool for manipulation of 
a populace. The ConSentiency out- 
lawed its use as an assault on indi- 
vidual rights and freedoms. The 
Gowachin had broken this prohibi- 
tion, yes, but a more interesting 
datum was surfacing: Dosadi had 
employed some eighty different 
governmental forms without reject- 
ing the DemoPol. That implied fre- 
quent changes. 

“How often have they changed 
their form of government?” 

“You can divide the numbers as 
easily as I,” Aritch said. His tone 
was petulant. 

McKie nodded. One thing had 
become quite clear. 

“Dosadi’s masses kno.w about the 
DemoPol but you won’t let them 
remove it!” 

Aritch had not expected this in- 
sight. He responded with revealing 
sharpness which was amplified by 
his muscle pains. 

“How did you learn that?” 

“You told me.” 

“I?” 

“Quite plainly. Such frequent 
change is responsive to an irritant 
— the DemoPol. They change the 
forms of government, but leave the 
irritant. Obviously, they cannot re- 
move the irritant. That was clearly 
part of your experiment — to raise a 
population resistant to the De- 
moPol.” 

“A resistant population, yes,” 
Aritch said. He shuddered. 

“You’ve fractured ConSentient 
Law in many places,” McKie said. 

“Does my Legum presume to 
judge me?” 

“No. But if I speak with a cer- 
tain bitterness, please recall that I 
am a Human. I embrace a profound 

34 



sympathy for the Gowachin, but I 
remain Human.” 

“Ahhhh, yes. We must not forget 
the long Human association with 
DemoPols.” 

“We survive by selecting the best 
decision makers,” McKie said. 

“And a DemoPol elevates 
mediocrity.” 

“Has that happened on Dosadi?” 

“No.” 

“But you wanted them to try 
many different governmental 
forms?” 

The High Magister shrugged, re- 
mained silent. 

“We Humans found that the De- 
moPol does profound damage to so- 
cial relationships. It destroys pre- 
selected portions of a society.” 

“And what could we hope to 
learn by damaging our Dosadi soci- 
ety?” 

“Have we arrived back at the 
question of expected benefits?” 

Aritch stretched his aching mus- 
cles. 

“You are persistent, McKie. I 
will say that.” 

McKie shook his head sadly. 

“The DemoPol was always held 
up to us as the ultimate equalizer, a 
source of decision-making miracles. 
It was supposed to produce a grow- 
ing body of knowledge about what 
a society really needed. It was 
thought to produce justice in all 
cases despite any odds.” 

Aritch was irritated. He leaned 
forward, wincing at the pain of his 
old muscles. 

“One might make the same ac- 
cusations about the law as practiced 
everywhere except on Gowachin 
worlds!” 

McKie suppressed a sharp re- 
GALAXY 




sponse. Gowachin training had 
forced him to question assumptions 
about the uses of law in the Con- 
Sentiency, about the inherent right- 
ness of any aristocracy, any power 
bloc whether majority or minority. 
It was a BuSab axiom that all 
power blocs tended toward aristo- 
cratic forms, that the descendants of 
decision makers dominated the 
power niches. BuSab never em- 
ployed offspring of their agents. 

Aritch repeated himself, a thing 
Gowachin seldom did. 

“Law is delusion and fakery, 
McKie, everywhere except on the 
Gowachin worlds! You give your 
law a theological aura. You ignore 
the ways it injures your societies. 
Just as with the DemoPol, you hold 
up your law as the unvarying source 
of justice. When you ...” 

“BuSab has . .” 

“No! If something’s wrong in 
your societies, what do you do? 
You create new law. You never 
think to remove law or disarm the 
law. You make more law! You 
create more legal professionals. We 
Gowachin sneer at you! We always 
strive to reduce the number of laws, 
the number of Legums. A Legum’s 
first duty is to avoid litigation. 
When we create new Legums, we 
always have specific problems in 
mind. We anticipate the ways the 
laws damage our society.” 

It was the opening McKie 
wanted. 

“Why are you training a 
Wreave?” 

Belatedly, Aritch realized he had 
been goaded into revealing more 
than he had wanted. 

“You are good, McKie. Very 
good.” 



“Why?” McKie persisted. “Why 
a Wreave?” 

“You will learn why in time.” 
McKie saw that Aritch would not 
expand on this answer, but there 
were other matters to consider now. 
It was clear that the Gowachin had 
trained him for a specific problem: 
Dosadi. To train a Wreave as 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



35 



Legum, they’d have an equally im- 
portani problem in mind . 
perhaps the same problem. A basic 
difference in the approach to law, 
species differentiated, had surfaced, 
however, and this could not be ig- 
nored. McKie well understood the 
Gowachin disdain for all legal sys- 
tems, including their own. They 
were educated from infancy to dis- 
trust any community of profession- 
als, especially legal professionals. A 
Legum could only tread their religi- 
ous path when he completely shared 
that distrust. 

Do / share that distrust? 

He thought he did. It came natu- 
rally to a BuSab agent. But most of 
the ConSentiency still held its pro- 
fessional communities in high es- 
teem, ignoring the nature of the in- 
tense competition for new 'achieve- 
ments which invariably overcame 
such communities: new achieve- 
ments, new recognition. But the 
new could be illusion in such com- 
munities because they always main- 
tained a peer review system nicely 
balanced with peer pressures for ego 
rewards. 

“Professional always means 
power,’’ the Gowachin said. 

The Gowachin distrusted power 
in all of its forms. They gave with 
one hand and took with the other. 
Legums faced death whenever they 
used the Law. To make new law in 
the Gowachin Courtarena was to 
bring about the elegant dissolution 
of old law with a concommittant 
application of justice. 

Not for the first time, McKie 
wondered about the unknown prob- 
lems a High Magister must face. It 
would have to be a delicate ex- 
istence indeed. McKie almost 



formed a question about this, 
thought better of it. He shifted in- 
stead to the unknowns about 
Dosadi. God Wall? Heavenly Veil? 

“Does Dosadi often accept a re- 
ligious oligarchy?’’ 

“As an outward form, yes. They 
currently are presided over by a 
supreme Elector, a Gowachin by the 
name of Broey.” 

“Have Humans ever held power 
equal to Broey’s?’’ 

“Frequently.” 

It was one of the most responsive 
exchanges that McKie had with 
Aritch. Although he knew he was fol- 
lowing the High Magister’s purpose, 
McKie decided to explore this. 

“Tell me about Dosadi’s social 
forms.” 

“They are the forms of a military 
organization under constant attack 
or threat of attack. They- form cer- 
tain cabals, certain power enclaves 
whose influences shift.” 

“Is there much violence?” 

“It is a world of constant vio- 
lence.” 

McKie absorbed this. Warlords. 
Military society. He knew he had 
Just lifted a comer of the real issue 
which had brought the Gowachin to 
the point of obliterating Dosadi. It 
was an area to be approached with 
extreme caution. McKie chose a 
flanking approach. 

"Aside from the military forms, 
what are the dominant occupations? 
.How do they perceive guilt and in- 
nocence? WTiat are their forms off 
punishment, of absolution. How dot 
they ...” I 

“You do not confuse me, I 
McKie. Consider, Legum: there are* 
better ways to answer such| 
questions.” 



36 



GALAXY 



Brought up short by the Magis- 
ter’s chiding tone, McKie fell into 
silence. He glanced out the oval 
window, realizing he’d been thrown 
onto the defensive with exquisite 
ease. McKie felt the nerves tingling 
along his spine. Danger! Tand- 
aloor’s golden sun had moved per- 
ceptibly closer to the horizon. That 
horizon was a blue-green line made 
hazy by kilometer after kilometer of 
hair trees whose slender female 
fronds waved and hunted in the air. 
Presently, McKie turned back to 
Aritch. 

Better ivays to answer such 
questions. 

It was obvious where the High 
Magister’s thoughts trended. The 
j experimenters would, of course, 

I have ways of watching their exper- 
i iment. They could also influence 
their experiment, but it was obvious 
there were limits to this influence. 

: A population resistant to outside in- 
fluences? The implied complications 
of this Dosadi problem daunted 
McKie. Oh, the circular dance the 
Gowachin always performed! 

Better ways. 

Aritch cleared his ventricle 
passages with a harsh exhalation, 
then: 

"Anticipating the possibility that 
others would censure us, we gave 
our test subjects the Primary.” 

Devils Jncarnate! The Gowachin 
set such store on their damned 
Primary! Of course all people were 
created unequal and had to find 
their own level! 

McKie knew he had no choice 
but to plunge into the maelstrom. 

“Did you also anticipate that 
you’d be charged with violating sen- 
tient rights on a massive scale?” 



Aritch shocked him by a brief 
puffing of jowls, the Gowachin 
shrug. 

McKie allowed himself a warning 
smile. 

“I remind the High Magister that 
he raised the issue of the Primary.” 

“Truth is truth.” 

McKie shook his head, sharply, 
not caring what this revealed. The 
High Magister couldn’t possibly 
have that low an estimation of his 
reasoning abilities. Truth indeed! 

‘Til give you truth: The ConSen- 
tiency has laws on this subject to 
which the Gowachin are sig- 
natories!” 

Even as the words fell from his 
lips, McKie realized this was pre- 
cisely where Aritch had wanted him 
to go. They’ve learned something 
from Dosadi! Something crucial! 

Aritch massaged the painful mus- 
cles of his thighs, said: “I remind 
you, Legum, that we peopled 
Dosadi with volunteers.” 

“Their descendants volunteered 
for nothing!” 

‘ ‘Ancestors always volunteer their 
descendants — for better or for 
worse. Sentient rights? Informed 
consent? The ConSentiency has 
been so busy building law upon 
law, creating its great illusion of 
rights, that you’ve almost lost sight 
of the Primary’s guiding principal: 
to develop our capacities. People 
who are never challenged never de- 
velop ramVa/ strengths!” 

Despite the perils, McKie knew 
he had to press for the answer to his 
original question: benefits. 

“What’ve you learned from your 
monster?” 

“You’ll soon have a complete 
answer to that question.” 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



37 



Again, the implication that he 
could actually watch Dosadi. But 
first it’d be well to disabuse Aritch 
of any suspicion that McKie was 
unaware of the root implications. 
The issue had to be met head on. 

“You’re not going to implicate 
me.’’ 

“Implicate you?” There was no 
mistaking Aritch’s surprise. 

“No matter how you use what 
you’ve learned from Dosadi, you’ll 
be suspected of evil intent. What- 
ever anyone learns from ...” 

“Oh, that. New data gives one 
power.” 

“And you do not confuse me, 
Aritch. In the history of every 
species there are many examples of 
places where new data has been 
gravely abused.” 

Aritch accepted this without ques- 
tion. They both knew the 
background. The Gowachin dis- 
trusted power in all of its forms, yet 
they used power with consummate 
skill. The trend of McKie’s 
thoughts lay heavily in this room 
now. To destroy Dosadi would be 
to hide whatever the Gowachin had 
learned there. McKie, a non- 
Gowachin, therefore, would learn 
those things, would share the man- 
tle of suspicion should it be cast. 
The historical abuses of new data 
occurred between the time that a 
few people learned the important 
thing and the time when that impor- 
tant thing became general knowl- 
edge. To the Gowachin and to 
BuSab it was the ‘Data Gap,’ a 
source of constant danger. 

“We would not try to hide what 
we’ve learned,” Aritch said, “only 
how we learned it.” 

“And it’s just an academic ques- 



tion whether you destroy an entire 
planet and every person on it!” 
“Ahh, yes: academic. What you 
don’t know, McKie, is that one of 
our test subjects on Dosadi has in- 
itiated, all on her own, a course of 
events which will destroy Dosadi 
very quickly whether we act or not ! 
You’ll leam all about this very soon 
when, like the good Legum we^ 
know you to be, you go there to 
experience this monster with your 
own flesh.” ' 



In the name of all that we to- 
gether hold holy I promise three 
things to the sacred congregation 
of people who are subject to my 
rule. In the first place, that the 
holy religion which we mutually 
espouse shall always preserve 
their freedom under my auspices; 
secondly, that | will temper every 
form of rapacity and inequity 
which may inflict itself upon us 
all; and thirdly, that I will com- 
mand swift mercy in all 
judgements, that to me and to 
you the gracious Lord may ex- 
tend His Recognition.

Broey arose from prayer, groped | 
behind him for the chair and sankj 
into it. Enclosed darkness sur-i 
rounded him. The room was a

Graluz. Pressure in the bubble 
excluded the water, but the space 
around Broey smelled reassuringly 
of the Graluz. This helped reinforce 
the mood he now required. 

Presently, the God spoke to him. 
Elation filled Broey. God spoke to 
him, only to him. Words hissed 
within his head. Scenes impinged 
themselves upon his vision centers. 

Yes! Yes! / keep the DemoPol! 

God was reassured and reflected 
that reassurance. 

Today, God showed him a ritual 
Broey had never seen before. The 
ritual was only for Gowachin. The 
ritual was called Laupuk. Broey 
saw the ritual in all of its gory de- 
tails, felt the rightness of it as 
though his very cells accepted it. 

Responsibility, expiation — these 
were the lessons of Laupuk. God 
approved when Broey expressed 
understanding. 

They communicated by words 
which Broey expressed silently in 
his thoughts, but there were other 
thoughts which God could not pex~ 
ceive. Just as God no doubt held 
thoughts which were not communi- 
cated to Broey. God used people, 
people used God. Divine interven- 
tion with cynical overtones. Broey 
had learned the Elector’s role 
through a long and painful appren- 
ticeship. 

I am your servant, God. 

As God admonished, Broey kept 
the secret of this private commu- 
nion. It suited his purpose to obey, 
as it obviously suited God’s pur- 
pose. There were times, though, 
when Broey wanted to shout it: 



“You fools! / speak with the 
voice of God!” 

Other Electors had made that mis- 
take. They’d soon fallen from the 
seat of power. Broey, drawing on 
several lifetimes of assembled ex- 
periences, knew he must keep ^s 
power if he ever were to escape 
from Dosadi. 

Anyway, the fools did his bid- 
ding (and therefore God’s) without 
divine admonition. All was well. 
One presented a selection of 
thoughts to God. .being careful 
always where and when one re- 
viewed private thoughts. There were 
times when Broey felt God within 
him when there’d been no prayer, 
no preparations here in the black- 
ness of this bubble room. God 
might peer out of Broey ’s eyes at 
any time — softly, quietly — 

examining His world and its works 
through mortal senses. 

“I guard My servant well.” 

The warmth of reassurance which 
flowed through Broey then was like 
the warmth of the Graluz when he’d 
still been a tad clinging to his 
mother’s back. It was a warmth and 
sense of safety which Broey tem- 
pered with a deep awareness of that 
other Graluz time: a giant grey- 
green adult male Gowachin raven- 
ing through the water, devouring 
those tads not swift enough, alert 
enough to escape. 

/ was one of the swift. 

Memory of that plunging, frantic 
flight in the Graluz had taught 
Broey how to behave with God. 

In his bubble room’s darkness, 
Broey shuddered. Yes, the ways of 
God were cruel. Thus armed, a ser- 
vant of God could be equally cruel, 
could surmount the fact that he

knew what it was to be both Human 
and Gowachin. He need only be the 
pure servant of God. This thou^t 
he shared. 

Beware, McKie. God has told me 
whence you come. I know your in- 
tentions. Hold fast to the narrow 
path, McKie. You risk my displea- 
sure.

Behavioral engineering in all of

it reduces all (manipulators and

achieve uniform behavioral re-

lie by many species but never 
with more telling effect than by 
the Gowachin on Dosadi. Here, 
they showed us the ‘Walden Fal-

plaining; "Given any species 
which reproduces by genetic

BuSab reference 



McKie walked through the 
jumpdoor and, as Aritch’s aides had 
said, found himself on sand at just 
past Dosadi’s midmorning. He 
looked up, seeking his first real- 
time view of the G^ Wall, wanting 
to share the Dosadi feeling of that 



enclosure. All he saw was a thin 
haze, faintly silver, disappointing. 
The sun circle was more defined 
than he’d expected and he knew 
from the holographic reproductions 
he’d seen that a few of the third 
magnitude stars would be filtered 
out at night. What else he’d ex- 
pected, McKie could not say, but 
somehow this milky veil was not it. 
Too thin, perhaps. It appeared in- 
substantial, too weak for the power 
it represented. 

The visible sun disk reminded 
him of another urgent necessity but 
he postponed that necessity while he 
examined his surroundings. 

A tall white rock? Yes, there it 
was on his left. 

They’d warned him to wait be- 
side that rock, that he’d be rela- 
tively safe there. Under no cir- 
cumstances was he to wander from 
this contact point. 

“We can tell you about the dan- 
gers of Dosadi but words are not 
enough. Besides, the place is al- 
ways developing new threats.” 

Things he’d learned in the brief- 
ing sessions over the past weeks 
reinforced the warning. The rock, 
twice as tall as a Human, stood 
only a few paces away, massive and 
forbidding. He went over and 
leaned against it. Sand grated be- 
neath his feet. He smelled unfamil- 
iar perfumes and acridities. The 
sun-warmed surface of the rock 
gave its energy to his flesh through 
the thin green coveralls they’d in- 
sisted he wear. 

McKie longed for his armored 
clothing and its devices to amplify 
muscles, but such things were not 
permitted. Only a reduced version 
of his toolkit had been allowed and

that reluctantly, a compromise. 
McKie had explained that the con- 
tents would be destroyed if anyone 
other than himself tried to pry into 
the kit’s secrets. Still, they’d 
warned him never to open the kit in 
the presence of a Dosadi native. 

“The most dangerous thing you 
can do is to underestimate any of 
the Dosadi.’’ 

McKie, staring around him, saw 
no Dosadi. 

Far off across a dusty landscape 
dotted with yellow bushes and 
brown rocks, he identified the hazy 
j spires of Chu rising out of its river 
I canyon. Heat waves dizzied the air 
; above the low scrub, giving the city 
: a magical appearance. 

McKie found it difficult to think 
j about Chu in the context of what 
I he’d learned during the crash course 
I the Gowachin had given him. Those 
! magical fluting spires reached 
heavenward from a muck where 
“you can buy anything . any- 
thing at all.” 

Aritch’s aides had sewn a large 
sum in Dosadi currency into the 
seams of his clothing but, at the 
same time, had forced him to digest 
hair-raising admonitions about “any 
show of unprotected wealth.” 

The jumpdoor attendants had re- 
capitulated many of the most urgent 
warnings, adding: 

“You may have a wait of several 
hours. We’re not sure. Just stay 
close to that rock where you’ll be 
relatively safe. We’ve made protec- 
tive arrangements which should 
work. Don’t eat or drink anything 
until you get into the city. You’ll be 
faintly sick with the diet change for 
a few days, but your body should 
adjust.” 



"Should adjust?” 

“Give it time.” 

He’d asked about specific dangers 
to which he should be most alert. 

“Stay clear of any Dosadi natives 
except your contacts. Above all, 
don’t even appear to threaten any- 
one.” 

“What if I get drowsy and take a 
nap?” 

They’d considered this, then: 

“You know, that might be the 
safest thing to do. Anyone who’d 
dare to nap out there would have to 
be damned well protected. There’d 
be some risk, of course, but there 
always is on Dosadi. But they’d be 
awfully leery of anyone casual 
enough to nap out there.” 

Again, McKie glanced around. 

Sharp whistlings and a low rasp 
like sand across wood came from 
behind the tall rock. Quietly, 
McKie worked his way around to 
where he could see the sources of 
these noises. The whistling was a 
yellow lizard almost the color of the 
bushes beneath which it crouched. 
The rasp came from a direction 
which commanded the lizard’s at- 
tention. Its source appeared to be a 
small hole beneath another bush. 
McKie thought he detected in the 
lizard only a faint curiosity about 
himself. Something about that hole 
and the noise issuing from it de- 
manded a great deal of concentrated 
attention. 

Something stirred in the hole’s 
blackness. 

The lizard crouched, continued to 
whistle. 

An ebony creature about the size 
of McKie’s fist emerged from the 
hole, darted forward, saw the 
lizard. Wings shot from the new- 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



41 



comer’s sides and it leaped upward 
but it was too late. With a swiftness 
which astonished McKie, the lizard 
shot forward, balled itself around its 
prey. A slit opened in the lizard’s 
stomach, surrounded the ebony crea- 
ture. With a final rasping, the 
black thing vanished into the lizard. 

All this time, the lizard continued 
to whistle. Still whistling, it 
crawled into the hole from which its 
prey had come. 

“Things are seldom what they 
seem to be on Dosadi,’’ McKie’s 
teachers had said. 

He wondered now what he had 
just seen. 

The whistling had stopped. 

The lizard and its prey reminded 
McKie that, as he’d been warned, 
there had not been time to prepare 
him for every new detail on Dosadi. 
He crouched now and, once more, 
studied his immediate surroundings. 

Tiny jumping things like insects 
inhabited the narrow line of shade 
at the base of the white rock. Green 
(blossoms?) opened and closed on 
the stems of the yellow bushes. The 
ground all around appeared to be a 
basic sand and clay but when he 
peered at it closely he saw veins 
and blue and red discoloration. He 
turned his back on the distant city, 
saw far away mountains: a purple 
graph line against silver sky. Rain 
had cut an arroyo in that direction. 
He saw touches of darker green 
reaching from the depths. The air 
tasted bitter. 

Once again, McKie made a 
sweeping study of his surroundings, 
seeking any sign of threat. Nothing 
he could identify. He palmed an in- 
strument from his toolkit, stood 
casually and stretched while he 



turned toward Chu. When he stole a 
glance at the instrument, it revealed 
a sonabarrier at the city. Absently 
scratching himself to conceal the 
motion, he returned the instrument 
to his kit. Birds floated in the silver 
sky above the sonabarrier. 

Why a sonabarrier? he won- 
dered. 

It would stop wild creatures, but 
not people. His teachers had said 
the sonabarrier excluded pests, ver- 
min. The explanation did not satisfy 
McKie. 

Things are seldom what they 
seem. 

Despite the God Wall, that sun 
was hot. McKie sought the shady 
side of the rock. Seated there, he 
glanced at the small white disk af- 
fixed to the green lapel at his left 
breast: OP40331-D404. It was stan- 
dard Galach script, the lingua franca 
of the ConSentiency. 

“They speak only Galach on 
Dosadi. They may detect an accent 
in your speech, but they won’t 
question it.’’ 

Aritch’s people had explained 
that this badge identified McKie as 
an open-contract worker, one with 
slightly above average skills in a 
particular field, but still part of the 
Labor Pool and subject to assign- 
ment outside his skill. 

“This puts you three hierarchical 
steps from the Rim,’’ they’d said. 

It’d been his own choice. The 
bottom of the social system always 
had its own communications chan- 
nels flowing with information based 
on accurate data, instinct, dream 
stuff and what was fed from the top 
with deliberate intent. Whatever 
happened here on Dosadi, its nature 
would be revealed in the uncon- 



42 



GALAXY 



scious processes of the Labor Pool. 
In the Labor Pool, he could tap that 
revealing flow. 

“I’ll be a weaver,” he’d said, 
explaining that it was a hobby he’d 
enjoyed for many years. 

The choice had amused his 
teachers. McKie had been unable to 
penetrate the reason for their 
amusement. 

“It is of no importance right 
now. One choice is as good as 
another.” 

They’d insisted he concentrate on 
what he’d been doing at the time, 
learning the signal mannerisms of 
Dosadi. Indeed, it’d been a hectic 
period on Tandaloor after Aritch’s 
insistence (with the most reasonable 
of arguments) that the best way for 
his Legum to proceed was to go 
personally to Dosadi. In retrospect, 
the arguments remained persuasive, 
but McKie had been surprised. For 
some reason which he could not 
now identify, he had expected a less 
involved overview of the experi- 
ment, watching through instruments 
and the spying abilities of the Cale- 
ban who guarded the place. 

McKie was still not certain how 
they expected him to pull this hot 
palip from the cooker but it was 
clear they expected it. Aritch had 
been mysteriously explicit: 

“You are Dosadi’s best chance 
for survival and our own best 
chance for . understanding.” 

They expected their Legum to 
save Dosadi while exonerating the 
Gowachin. It was a Legum’s task to 
win for his client, but these had to 
be the strangest circumstances with 
the client retaining the absolute 
power of destruction over the 
threatened planet. 



On Tandaloor, McKie had been 
allowed just time for short naps. 
Even then, his sleep had been rest- 
less, part of his mind infernally 
aware of where he lay; the bedog 
strange and not quite attuned to his 
needs, the odd noises beyond the 
walls — water gurgling somewhere, 
always water. 

When he’d trained there as a 
Legum that had been one of his first 
adjustments: the uncertain rhythms 
of disturbed water. Gowachin never 
strayed far from water. The 
Graluz — that central pool and 
sanctuary for females, the place 
where Gowachin raised those tads 
which survived the ravenous weed- 
ing by the male parent — The Graluz 
always remained a central fixation 
for the Gowachin. As the saying put 
it: 

“If you do not understand the 
Graluz you do not understand the 
Gowachin.” 

As such sayings went, it was ac- 
curate only up to a point. 

But there was always the water, 
contained water, the nervous slap- 
ping of wavelets against walls. The 
sound conveyed no fixed rhythms, 
but it was a profound clue to the 
Gowachin: contained, yet always 
different. 

For all short distances, swimming 
tubes connected Gowachin facilities. 
They traversed long distances by 
jumpdoor or in hissing jetcars which 
moved on magnetic cushions. The 
comings and goings of such cars 
had disturbed McKie’s sleep during 
the period of the crash course on 
Dosadi. Sometimes, desperately 
tired, his body demanding rest, he 
would find himself awakened by 
voices. And the subtle interference 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



43 



of the other sounds — the cars, the 
waves — made eavesdropping dif- 
ficult. Awake in the night, McKie 
would strain for meaning. He felt 
like a spy listening for vital clues, 
seeking every nuance in the casual 
conversations of people beyond his 
walls. Frustrated, always fmstrated, 
he had retreated into sleep. And 
when, as happened occasionally, all 
sound ceased, this brought him to 
full alert, heart pounding, wonder- 
ing what had gone wrong. 

And the odors! What memories 
they brought back to him. Graluz 
musk, the bitter pressing of exotic 
seeds, permeated every breath. Fern 
tree pollen intruded with its under- 
tones of citrus. And the caraeli, tiny 
frog-like pets, invaded your sleep 
at every dawning with their exquis- 
ite belling arias. 

During those earlier days of train- 
ing on Tandaloor, McKie had felt 
more than a little lost, hemmed in 
by threatening strangers, constantly 
aware of the important matters 
which rode on his success. But 
things were different after the inter- 
view with Aritch. McKie was now 
a trained, tested and proven Legum, 
not to mention a renowned agent of 
BuSab. Yet there were times when 
the mood of those earlier days in- 
truded. Such intrusions annoyed 
him with their implication that he 
was being maneuvered into peril 
against his will, that the Gowachin 
secretly laughed as they prepared 
him for some ultimate humiliation. 
They were not above such a jest. 
Common assessment of Gowachin 
by non-Gowachin said the Frog 
God’s people were so ultimately 
civilized they had come full circle 
into a form of primitive savagery. 



Look at the way Gowachin males 
slaughtered their own newborn tads! 

Once, during one of the rare naps 
Aritch’s people permitted him, 
McKie had awakened to sit up and 
try to shake off that depressing 
mood of doom. He told himself true 
things: that the Gowachin flattered 
him now, deferred to him, treated 
him with that quasi-religious respect 
which they paid to all Legums. But 
there was no evading another truth: 
the Gowachin had groomed him for 
their Dosadi problem over a long 
period of time and they were being 
less than candid with him about that 
long process and its intentions. 

There were always unfathomed 
mysteries when dealing with 
Gowachin. 

When he’d tried returning to 
sleep that time, it was to encounter 
disturbing dreams of massed sen- 
tient flesh (both pink and green), all 
naked and quite defenseless before 
the onslaught of gigantic Gowachin 
males. 

The dream’s message was clear. 
The Gowachin might very well de- 
stroy Dosadi in the way (and for 
similar reasons) that they winnowed 
their own tads — searching, endlessly 
searching for the strongest and most 
resilient survivors. 

The problem they’d dumped in 
his lap daunted McKie. If the 
slightest inkling of Dosadi leaked 
into common awareness without a 
concurrent justification, the 
Gowachin Federation would be 
hounded unmercifully. The 
Gowachin had clear and sufficient 
reason to destroy the evi- 
dence ... or to let the evidence de- 
stroy itself. 

Justification. 



44 



GALAXY 



Where was that to be found? In 
the elusive benefits which had 
moved the Gowachin to mount this 
experiment? 

Even if he found that justifica- 
tion, Dosadi would be an upheaval 
in the ConSentiency. It’d be the 
subject of high drama. More than 
twenty generations of Humans and 
Gowachin surfacing without warn- 
ing! Their lonely history would titil- 
late countless beings. The limits of 
language would be explored to 
wring the last drop of emotive es- 
sence from this revelation. 

No matter how explained, 
Gowachin motives would come in 
for uncounted explorations and sus- 
picions. 

Why did they really do it? What 
happened to their original volun- 
teers? 

People would look backward into 
their own ancestry — Human and 
Gowachin alike. “Is that what hap- 
pened to Uncle Elfred?” Gowachin 
phylum records would be explored. 
“Yes! Here are two — gone without 
record!” 

Aritch’s people admitted that “a 
very small minority” had mounted 
this project and kept the lid on it. 
Were they completely sane, this 
Gowachin cabal? 

McKie’s short naps were always 
disturbed by an obsequious 
Gowachin bowing over his bedog, 
begging him to return at once to the 
briefing sessions which prepared 
him for survival on Dosadi. 

Those briefing sessions! The im- 
plied prejudices hidden in every one 
raised more questions than were an- 
swered. McKie tried to retain a 
reasoned attitude, but irritants con- 
stantly assailed him. 



Why had the Gowachin of Dosadi 
taken on Human emotional charac- 
teristics? Why were Dosadi ’s Hu- 
mans aping Gowachin social com- 
pacts? Were the Dosadi truly aware 
of why they changed governmental 
forms so often? 

The bland answer to his frequent 
questions enraged McKie. 

“All will be made clear when 
you experience Dosadi for your- 
self” 

He’d finally fallen into a 

counter-irritant patter: 

“You don’t really know the an- 
swer, do you? You’re hoping I’ll 
find out for you!” . 

Some of the data recitals bored | 
McKie. While listening to a ( 

Gowachin explain what was known j 
about Rim relationships, he would ; 
find himself distracted by people ; 
passing in the multi-sentient access ‘ 
way outside the briefing area. , 

Once, Ceylang entered and sat on j 
the side of the room watching him I 
with a hungry silence which rubbed | 
McKie’s sensibilities to angry raw- j 
ness. He’d longed for the blue : 
metal box then, but once the solemn | 
investment had pulled the mantel of | 
Legumic protection around him, the | 
box had ^en removed to its sacred j 
niche. He’d not see it again unless | 
this issue entered the Courtarena. i 
Ceylang remained an unanswered { 
question among many. Why did that 
dangerous Wreave female haunt this ; 
room without contributing one 
thing? He suspected they allowed 
Ceylang to watch him through re- 
mote spy devices. Why did she 
choose that once to come in person? 
To let him know he was being ob- 
served? It had something to do with 
whatever had prompted the 



46 



GALAXY 



Gowachin to train a Wreave. They 
had some future problem which 
only a Wreave could solve. They 
were grooming this Wreave as 
they’d groomed him. Why? What 
Wreave capabilities attracted the 
Gowachin? How did this Wreave 
female differ from other Wreaves? 
Where were her loyalties? What 
was the ‘Wreave Bet’? 

This led McKie into another av- 
enue never sufficiently explored: 
What Human capabilities had led 
the Gowachin to him? Dogged per- 
sistence? A background in Human 
law? The essential individualism of 
the Human? 

There were no sure answers to 
these questions, no more than there 
were about the Wreave. Her pres- 
ence continued to fascinate him, 
however. McKie knew many things 
about Wreave society not in com- 
mon awareness outside the Wreave 
worlds. They were, after all, inte- 
gral and valued partners in BuSab. In 
shared tasks, a cameraderie de- 
veloped which often prcmipted inti- 
mate exchanges of information. Be- 
yond the fact that Wreaves required 
a breeding triad for reproduction, he 
knew that Wreaves had never dis- 
covered a way to determine in ad- 
vance which of the Triad would be 
capable of nursing the offspring. 
This formed an essential building 
stone in Wreave society. Periodi- 
cally, this person from the triad 
would be exchanged for a like per- 
son from another triad. This insured 
their form of genetic dispersion and, 
of equal importance, built countless 
linkages throughout their civiliza- 
tion. With each such linkage went 
requirements for unquestioning sup- 
port in times of trouble. 



A Wreave in the Bureau had tried 
to explain this: 

“Take, for example, the situation 
where a Wreave is murdered or, 
even worse, deprived of essential 
vanity. The guilty party would be 
answerable personally to millions 
upon millions of us. Wherever the 
triad exchange has linked us, we are 
^uired to respond intimately to the 
insult. The closest thing you have to 
this, as I understand it, is familial 
responsibility. We have this familial 
responsibility for vendetta where 
such affronts occur. You have no 
idea how difficult it was to release 
those of us in BuSab from 
this . this bondage, this network 
of responsibility.” 

The Gowachin would know this 
about the Wreaves, McKie thought. 
Had this characteristic attracted the 
Gowachin or had they chosen in 
spite of it, making their decision 
because of some other Wreave as- 
pect? Would a Wreave Legum con- 
tinue to share that network of famil- 
ial responsibility? How could that 
be? Wreave society could only 
offend a basic sensibility of the 
Gowachin. The Frog God’s people 
were even more . more exclusive 
and individual than Humans. To the 
Gowachin, family remained a pri- 
vate thing, walled off from stran- 
gers in an isolation which was aban- 
doned only when you entered your 
chosen phylum. 

As he waited beside the white 
rock on Dosadi, McKie reflected on 
these matters, biding his time, lis- 
tening. The alien heat, the smells 
and unfamiliar noises, disturbed 
him. He’d been told to listen for the 
sound of an internal combustion en- 
gine. Internal combustion! But the 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



47 



Dosadi used such devices outside 
the city because they were more 
powerful (although much larger) 
than the beamed impulse drivers 
which they used wjthin Chu’s walls. 

“The fuel is alcohol. Most of the 
raw materials come from the Rim. 
It doesn’t matter how much poison 
there is in such fuel. They ferment 
bushes, trees, ferns . anything 
the Rim supplies.” 

A sleepy quiet surrounded McKie 
now. For a long time he’d been 
girding himself to risk the thing he 
knew he would have to do once he 
was alone on Dosadi. He might 
never again be this alone 
here . probably not once he was 
into Chu’s warrens. He knew the 
futility of trying to contact his Tap- 
risiot monitor. Aritch, telling him 
the Gowachin knew that BuSab had 
invested in ‘Taprisiot insurance,’ 
had said: 

“Not even a Taprisiot call can 
penetrate the God Wall.” 

In the event of Dosadi’s destruc- 
tion, the Caleban contract ended. 
McKie’s Taprisiot might even have 
an instant to complete the death rec- 
ord of McKie’s memories. Might. 
That was academic to McKie in his 
present circumstances. The Cale- 
bans owed him a debt. McKie had 
removed the Whipping Star threat 
which had been as deadly to Cale- 
bans as to any other species which 
had ever used jumpdoors. Users of 
jumpdoors and the Caleban who 
controlled those jumpdoors had 
been doomed. The Caleban he knew 
by the pseudonym ‘Fannie Mae’ 
had expressed the debt to McKie in 
her own peculiar way: 

“The owing of me to thee con- 
nects to no ending.” 

48 



Aritch could have alerted his 
Dosadi guardian against any attempt 
by McKie to contact another Cale- 
ban. McKie doubted this. Aritch 
had specified a ban against Taprisiot 
calls. But all Calebans shared an 
awareness at some level. If Aritch 
and company had been lulled into a 
mistaken assumption about the se- 
curity of their barrier around 
Dosadi. 

Carefully, McKie cleared his 
mind of any thoughts about Tap- 
risiots. This wasn’t easy. It required 
a Sufi concentration upon a particu- 
lar void. There could be no acci- 
dental thrust of his mind at the Tap- 
risiot waiting in the safety of Cen- 
tral Central with its endless pa- 
tience. Everything must be blanked 
from awareness except a clear pro- 
jection toward Fannie Mae. 

McKie visualized her. She was 
visible in this universe as the star 
Thyone. He recalled their long 
hours of mental give and take. He 
projected the warmth of emotional 
attachment. As he had saved Fannie 
Mae, she had protected and saved 
him. The emotion was real. 

Presently, he closed his eyes, 
amplified that internal image which 
now suffused his mind. He felt his 
muscles relax. The warm rock 
against his back, the sand beneath 
him, faded from awareness. Only 
the glowing presence of a Caleban 
remained in his mind. 

“Who calls?” 

The words touched his auditory 
centers, but not his ears. 

“It’s McKie, friend of Fannie 
Mae. Are you the Caleban of the 
God Wall?” 

“I am the God Wall. Have you 
come to worship?” 



GALAXY 



McKie felt his thoughts stumble. 
Worship? The projection from this 
Caleban was echoing and porten- 
tous, not at all like the probing 
curiosity he always sensed in Fannie 
Mae. He fought to regain that first 
clear image. The inner glow of a 
Caleban contact returned. He sup- 
posed there might be something 
worshipful in this experience. You 
were never absolutely certain of a 
Caleban 's meaning. 

“It’s McKie, friend of Fannie 
Mae,” he repeated. 

The glow within McKie dimmed, 
then: “But you occupy a point upon 
Dosadi’s wave.” 

That was a familiar kind of 
communication, one to which 
McKie could apply previous experi- 
ence in the hope of a small under- 
standing, an approximation. 

“Does the God Wall permit me 
to contact Fannie Mae?” 

Words echoed in his head: 

“One Caleban, all Caleban.” 

“I wish to converse with Fannie 
Mae.” 

“You are not satisfied with your 
present body?” 

McKie felt his body then, the 
trembling flesh, the zombie-like 
trance state which went with Caleban 
or Taprisiot contact. The question 
had no meaning to him, but the 
body contact was real and it 
threatened to break off communica- 
tion. Slowly, McKie fought back to 
that tenuous mind-presence. 

“I am Jorj X. McKie. Calebans 
are in my debt.” 

“All Calebans know this debt.” 

“Then honor your debt.” 

He waited, trying not to grow 
tense. 

The glow within his head was re- 



placed by a new presence. It in- 
sinuated itself into McKie’s aware- 
ness with penetrating familiarity — 
not full mental contact but rather a 
playing upon those regions of his 
brain where sight and sound were 
interpreted. McKie recognized this 
new presence. 

“Fannie Mae!” 

“What does McKie require?” 

For a Caleban, it was quite a di- 
rect communication. McKie, noting 
this, responded more directly: 

“I require your help.” 

“Explain.” 

“I may be killed here. .ahh, 
have an end to my node here on 
Dosadi.” 

“Dosadi’s wave,” she corrected 
him. 

“Yes. And if that happens, if I 
die here, I have friends on Central 
Central. .on Central Central’s 
wave. .friends there who must 
learn everything that’s in my mind 
when I die.” 

“Only Taprisiot can do this. 
Dosadi contract forbids Taprisiots.” 
“But if Dosadi is destroyed. .” 
“Contract promise passes no end- 
ing, McKie.” 

“You cannot help me?” 

“You wish advice from Fannie 
Mae?” 

“Yes.” 

“Fannie Mae able to maintain 
contact with McKie while he oc- 
cupies Dosadi’s wave.” 

Constant trance? McKie was 
shocked. 

She caught this. 

“No trance. McKie’s nexus 
known to Fannie Mae.” 

“I think not. I can’t have any 
distractions here.” 

“Bad choice.”

She was petulant. 

“Could you provide me with a 
personal jumpdoor to. .” 

“Not with node ending close to 
ending for Dosadi wave.” 

“Fannie Mae, do you know what 
the Gowachin are doing here on 
Dosadi? This is. .” 

“Caleban contract, McKie.” 

Her displeasure was clear. You 
didn’t question the honor of a Cale- 
ban ’s word-writ. The Dosadi con- 
tract undoubtedly contained specific 
prohibitions against any revelations 
of what went on here. McKie was 
dismayed. He was tempted to leave 
Dosadi immediately. 

Fannie Mae' got his message, too. 
“McKie can leave now. Soon, 
McKie cannot leave in his own 
body/node.” 

“Body/node?” 

“Answers not permitted.” 

Not permitted! 

“I thought you were my friend, 
Fannie Mae!” 

Warmth suffused him. 

“Fannie Mae possesses friendship 
for McKie.” 

“Then why won’t you help me?” 
“You wish to leave Dosadi’s 
wave in this instant?” 

“No!” 

“Then Fannie Mae cannot help.” 
Angry, McKie began to break 
contact. 

Fannie Mae projected sensations 
of frustration and hurt. “Why does 
McKie refuse advice? Fannie Mae 
wishes. .” 

“I must go. You know I’m in a 
trance while we’re in contact. 
That’s dangerous here. We’ll speak 
another time. I appreciate your wish 
to help and your new clarity 
but. .” 



“Not clarity! Very small hole in 
understanding but Human keeps no 
more dimension!” 

Obvious unhappiness accom- 
panied this response but she broke 
the contact. McKie felt himself 
awakening, his fingers and toes 
trembling with cold. Caleban con- 
tact had slowed his metabolism to a 
dangerous low. He opened his eyes. 

A strange Gowachin clad in the 
yellow of an armored vehicle driver 
stood over him. A tracked machine 
rumbled and puffed in the 
background. Blue smoke enveloped 
it. McKie stared upward in shock. 

The Gowachin nodded com- 
panionably. 

“You are ill?”

as soon as the afternoon shadows

gloomed the depths of the city, Tria 
and six carefully chosen com- 
panions, all of them young Human 
males. She’d musked herself to key 
them up and she led them down 
dim byways where Broey’s spies 
had been eliminated. All of her 
troop was armored and armed in the 
fashion of an ordinary sortie team. 

There’d been rioting nearby an 
hour earlier, not sufficiently disrup- 
tive to attract large military atten- 
tion, but a small Gowachin salient 
had been eliminated from a Human 
enclave. A sortie team was the kind 
of thing this Warren could expect 
after such a specific species adjust- 
ment. Tria and her six companions 
were not likely to suffer attack. 
None of the rioters wanted a large 
scale mopping up in the area. 

A kind of hushed, suspenseful 
waiting pervaded the streets. 

, They crossed a wet intersection, 

! green and red ichor in the gutters. 

1 The smell of the dampness told her 
i that a graluz had been broached and 
its waters freed to wash through the 
streets. 

That would attract retaliation. 
Some Human children were certain 
to be killed in the days ahead. An 
old pattern. 

The troop crossed the riot area 
presently, noting the places where 
bodies had fallen, estimating casual- 
ties. All bodies had been removed. 
Not a scrap remained for the birds. 

They emerged from the Warrens 
soon afterward, passing through a 
Gowachin-guarded gate, Broey’s 
people. A few blocks along they 
went through another gate, Human 
guards, all in Gar’s pay. Broey 
would learn of her presence here 
soon, Tria knew, but she’d said she 



was going into the Warrens. She 
came presently to an alleyway 
across from a Second Rank build- 
ing. The windowless grey of the 
building’s lower floors presented a 
blank face broken only by the lat- 
tice armor of the entrance gate. Be- 
hind the gate lay a dimly lighted 
passage. Its deceptively plain walls 
concealed spy devices and auto- 
matic weapons. 

Holding back her companions 
with a hand motion, Tria waited in 
the dark while she studied the build- 
ing entrance across from her. The 
gate was on a simple latch. There 
was one doorguard in an alcove on 
the left near the door which was 
dimly visible beyond the armorwork 
of the gate. A building defense 
force stood ready to come at the 
doorguard’s summons or at the 
summons of those who watched 
through the spy devices. 

Tria’s informants said this was 
Jedrik’s bolt hole. Not in the War- 
rens at all. Clever, clever. But Tria 
had maintained an agent in this 
building for years as she kept agents 
in many buildings. A conventional 
precaution. Everything depended on 
timing now. Her agent in the build- 
ing was poised to eliminate the 
inner guards at the spy-device sta- 
tion. Only the doorguard would re- 
main. Tria waited for the agreed 
upon moment. 

The street around her smelled of 
sewage: an open reclamation line. 
Accident? Riot damage? Tria didn’t 
like the feeling of this place. What 
was Jedrik’s game? Were there un- 
known surprises built into this 
guarded building? Jedrik must know 
by now that she was suspected of 
inciting the riot. .and of other 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



51 



matters. But would she feel safe 
there in her own enclave? People 
tended to feel safe among their own 
people. She couldn’t have a very 
large force around her, though. 
Still, some private plot worked it- 
self through the devious pathways 
of Jedrik’s mind and Tria had not 
yet fathomed all of that plot. There 
were surface indicators enough to 
risk a confrontation, a parley. It 
was possible that Jedrik flaunted 
herself here to attract Tria. The po- 
tential in that possibility filled Tria 
with excitement. 

Together, we’d be unbeatable! 

Yes. .Jedrik fitted the image of 
a superb agent. With the proper or- 
ganization around her. 

Once more, Tria glanced left and 
right. The streets were appropriately 
empty. She checked the time. Her 
moment had come. With hand mo- 
tions, she sent flankers out left and 
right and another young male pro- 
bing straight across the street to the 
gate. When they were in place, she 
slipped across with her three re- 
maining companions in a triangular 
shield ahead. 

The doorguard was a Human with 
grey hair and a pale face which glis- 
tened yellow in the dim light of the 
passage. His lids were heavy with a 
recent dose of his personal drug 
which Tria’s agent had supplied. 

Tria opened the gate, saw that the 
guard carried a round dead-man 
switch in his right hand as ex- 
pected. His grin was gap-toothed as 
he held the switch toward her. She 
knew he’d recognized her. Much 
depended now on her agent’s accu- 
racy. 

“Do you want to die for the 
frogs?’’ Tria asked. 

52 



He knew about the rioting, the 
trouble in the streets. And he was 
Human with Human loyalties, bul 
he knew she worked for Broey, a 
Gowachin. The question was pre- 
cisely calculated to fill him with in- 
decision. Was she a turncoat? He 
had his Human loyalties and a fana- 
tic’s dependence upon this guard 
post which kept him out of the 
Warrens. And there was his per- 
sonal addiction. All doorguards 
were addicted to something, but this 
one took a drug which dulled his 
senses and made it difficult for him 
to correlate several lines of thought 
He wasn’t supposed to use his drug 
on duty and this troubled him now. 
There were so many matters to be 
judged and Tria had asked the righi 
question. He didn’t want to die for 
the frogs. 

She pointed to the dead-man 
switch, a question. 

“It’s only a signal relay,” he 
said. “No bomb in this one.” 

She remained silent, forcing him 
to focus on his doubts. 

The guard swallowed. “What do 
you. .” 

“Join us or die.” 

He peered past her at the others. 
Things such as this happened fre- 
quently in the Warrens, not verj 
often here on the slopes which led 
up to the heights. The guard was 
not a one trusted with full knowl- 
edge of who he guarded. He had 
explicit instructions and a dead-man 
relay to warn of intruders. Othen 
were charged with making the more 
subtle distinctions, the real deci- 
sions. That was this building’s weal 
point. 

“Join who?” he asked. 

There was false belligerency in 

GALAXY 



his voice and she knew she had him 
then. 

“Your own kind.” 

This locked his drug-dulled mind 
onto its primary fears. He knew 
what he was supposed to do: open 
his hand. That released the alarm 
device in the dead-man switch. He 
could do this of his own volition 
and it was supposed to deter attac- 
kers from killing him. A dead 
man’s hand opened anyway. But 
he’d been fed with suspicions to in- 
crease his doubts. The device in his 
hand might not be a simple signal 
transmitter. What if it actually were 
a bomb? He’d had many long hours 
to wonder about that. 

“We’ll treat you well,” Jedrik 
said. 

She put a companionable arm 
around his shoulder, letting him get 
the full effect of her musk while she 
held out her other hand to show that 
it carried no weapon. “Demonstrate 
to my companion here how you 
pass that to your relief.” 

One of the young males stepped 
forward. 

The guard showed how it was 
done, explaining slowly as he 
passed the device. “It’s easy once 
you get the trick of it.” 

When her companion had the 
thing finnly in hand, she raised her 
arm from the guard’s shoulder, 
touched his carotid artery with a 
poisoned needle concealed in a fin- 
gernail. The guard had only time to 
draw one gasping breath, his eyes 
gaping before he sank from her em- 
brace. 

“I treated him well,” she said. 

Her companions grinned. It was 
the kind of thing you learned to ex- 
pect from Tria. They dragged the 



body out of sight into the guard al- 
cove and the young male with the 
signal device took his place at the 
door. The others protected Tria with 
their bodies as they swept into the 
building. The whole operation had 
taken less than two minutes. Every- 
thing was working smoothly as 
Tria’s operations were expected to 
work. 

The lobby and its radiating hall- 
ways were empty. 

Good. 

Her agent in this building de- 
served a promotion. 

They took a stairway rather than 
trust an elevator. It was only three 
short flights. The upper hallway 
also was empty. Jedrik led the way 
to the designated door, used the key 
her agent had supplied. The door 
opened without a sound and they 
surged into the room. 

Inside, the shades had been 
pulled and there was no artificial il- 
lumination. Her companions took 
up their places at the closed door 
and along both flanking walls. This 
was the most dangerous moment, 
something only Tria could handle. 

Light came from thin strips where 
shades did not quite seal a south 
window. Tria discerned dim shapes 
of furniture, a bed with an indeter- 
minate blob of darkness on it. 

“Jedrik?” A whisper. 

Tria’s feet touched soft fabric, a 
sandal. 

“Jedrik?” 

Her shin touched the bed. She 
held a weapon ready while she felt 
for the dark blob. It was only a 
mound of bedding. She turned. 

The bathroom door was closed, 
but she could make out a thin slot 
of light at the bottom of the door. 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



53 



She skirted the clothing and sandal 
on the floor, stood at one side and 
motioned a companion to the other 
side. Thus far they had operated 
with a minimum of sound. 

Gently, she turned the knob, 
thrust open the door. There was 
water in a tub and a body face 
down, one arm hanging flaccidly 
over the edge, fingers dangling. A 
dark purple welt was visible behind 
and beneath the left ear. Tria lifted 
the head by the hair, stared at the 
face, lowered it gently to avoid 
splashing. It was her agent, the one 
she’d trusted for the intelligence to 
set up this operation. And the death 
was characteristic of a Gowachin 
ritual slaying . that welt under 
the ear. A Gowachin talon driven in 
there to silence the victim before 
drowning? Or had it just been made 
to appear like a Gowachin slaying? 

Tria felt the whole operation fal- 
ling apart around her, sensed the 
uneasiness of her companions. She 
considered calling Gar from where 
she stood but a feeling of fear and 
revulsion came over her. She 
stepped out into the bedroom before 
opening her communicator and 
thumbing the emergency signal. 
“Central.” The voice was tense. 
She Kept her own voice flat. 
“Our agent’s dead.” 

Silence. She could imagine them 
centering the locator on her trans- 
mission, then: “There?” 

“Yes. She’s been murdered.” 
Gar’s voice came on: “That can’t 
be. I talked to her less than an hour 
ago. She . .” 

“Drowned in a tub of water,” 
Tria said. “She was knocked out 
first . something sharp driven in 
under an ear.” 



There was silence again while 
Gar absorbed this data. He would 
have the same uncertainties as Tria. 

She glanced at her companions. 
They had taken up guard positions 
facing the doorway to the hall. Yes, 
if attack came, it would come from 
there. 

The channel to Gar remained 
open and now Tria heard a babble 
of terse orders with only a few 
words intelligible: ”... team 

. don’t let . time ...” 
Then, quite clearly: “They’ll pay 
for this!” 

Who will pay? Tria wondered. 

She was beginning to make a 
new assessment of Jedrik. 

Gar came back on: “Are you in 
immediate danger?” 

“I don’t know.” It was a reluc- 
tant admission. 

“Stay right where you are. We’ll 
send help. I’ve notified Broey.” 

So that was the way Gar saw it. 
Yes. That was most likely the pro- 
per way to handle this new de- 
velopment. Jedrik had eluded them. 
There was no sense in proceeding 
alone. It would have to be done 
Broey’s way now. 

Tria shuddered as she issued the 
necessary orders to her companions. 
They prepared to sell themselves 
dearly if an attack came, but Tria 
was beginning to doubt there’d be 
an immediate attack. This was 
another message from Jedrik. The 
trouble came when you tried to 
interpret the message.

— BuSab Manual, Chapter Five: 
“The Warlord Syndrome” 



McKie, awakening from the 
communications trance, realized 
how he must’ve appeared to this 
strange Gowachin towering over 
him. Of course a Dosadi Gowachin 
would think him ill. He’d been 
shivering and mumbling in the 
trance, perspiration rolling from 
him. McKie took a deep breath. 
“No, I’m not ill.” 

“Then it’s an addiction?” 
Recalling the many substances to 
which the Dosadi could be addicted, 
McKie almost used this excuse but 
thought better of it. This Gowachin 
might demand some of the addictive 
substance. 

“Not an addiction,” McKie said. 
He lifted himself to his feet, 
glanced around. The sun had moved 
perceptibly toward the horizon be- 
hind its .streaming veil. 

And something new had been 
added to the landscape — that gigan- 
tic tracked vehicle, which stood 
throbbing and puffing smoke from a 
vertical stack behind the Gowachin 
intmder. The Gowachin maintained 
a steady, intense concentration on 



McKie, disconcerting in its unwav- 
ering directness. McKie had to ask 
himself if this were some threat or 
his Dosadi contact? Aritch’s people 
had said a vehicle would be sent to 
the contact point, but . 

“Not ill, not an addiction,” the 
Gowachin said. “Is it some strange 
condition which only Humans 
have?” 

“I was ill,” McKie said. “But 
I’m recovered. The condition has 
passed.” 

“Do you often have such at- 
tacks?” 

“I can go years without a recur- 
rence.” 

“Years? What causes this 
. condition?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“I . ahhhh.” The Gowachin 
nodded, gestured upward with his 
chin. “An affliction of the Gods, 
perhaps.” 

“Perhaps.” 

“You were completely vulnera- 
ble.” 

McKie shrugged. Let the 
Gowachin make of that what he 
could. 

“You were not vulnerable?’’ 
Somehow, this amused the 
Gowachin, who added: “I am 
Bahrank. Perhaps that’s the luckiest 
thing which has ever happened to 
you.” 

Bahrank was the name Aritch’s 
aides had given as McKie’s first 
contact. 

“I am McKie.” 

“You fit the description, McKie, 
except for your, ahhhh, condition. 
Do you wish to say more?” 

McKie wondered what Bahrank 
expected. This was supposed to be 
a simple contact handing him on to 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



55 



more important people. Aritch was 
certain to have knowledgeable ob- 
servers on Dosadi, but B^rank was 
not supposed to be one of them. 
The warning about this Gowachin 
had been specific. 

“Bahrank doesn’t know about us. 
Be extremely careful what you re- 
veal to him. It’d be very dangerous 
to you if he were to learn that you 
came from beyond the God Veil.” 
The jumpdoor aides had rein- 
forced the warning. 

‘‘If the Dosadi penetrate your 
cover you’ll have to return to your 
pickup point on your own. We very 
much doubt that you could make it. 
Understand that we can give you lit- 
tle help once we’ve put you on 
Dosadi.” 

Bahrank visibly came to a deci- 
sion, nodding to himself. 

‘‘Jedrik expects you.” 

That was the other name Aritch’s 
people had provided. ‘‘Your cell 
leader. She’s been told that you’re a 
new infiltrator from the Rim. Jedrik 
doesn’t know your true origin.” 
“Who does know?” 

“We cannot tell you. If you 
don’t know then that information 
cannot be wrested from you. We 
assure you, though, that Jedrik isn’t 
one of our people.” 

McKie didn’t like the sound of 
that warning. ”... wrested from 
you.” As usual, BuSab sent you 
into the tiger’s mouth without a full 
briefing on the length of the tiger’s 
fangs. 

Bahrank gestured toward his 
tracked vehicle. “Shall we go?” 
McKie glanced at the machine. It 
was an obvious war device, heavily 
armored with slits in its metal cab, 
projectile weapons protruding at odd 



angles. It looked squat and deadly. 
Aritch’s people had mentioned such 
things. 

“We saw to it that they got only 
primitive armored vehicles, projec- 
tile weapons and relatively unimpor- 
tant explosives, that sort of thing. 
They’ve been quite resourceful in 
their adaptations of such weaponry, 
however.” 

Once more, Bahrank gestured 
toward his vehicle, obviously anx- 
ious to leave. 

McKie was forced to suppress an 
abrupt feeling of profound anxiety. 
What had he gotten himself into? 
He felt that he had awakened to 
find himself on a terrifying slide 
into peril, unable to control the least 
threat. The sensation passed but it 
left him shaken. He delayed while 
he continued to stare at the vehicle. 
It was about six meters long with 
heavy tracks plus other wheels 
faintly visible within the shadows 
behind the tracks. It sported a con- 
ventional antenna at the rear for 
tapping the power transmitter in 
orbit beneath the barrier veil, but 
there was a secondary system which 
burned a stinking fuel. The smoke 
of that fuel filled the air around 
them with acridity. 

“For what do we wait?” Bahrank 
demanded. He glared at McKie with 
obvious fear and suspicion. 

“We can go now,” McKie said. 

Bahrank turned and led the way 
swiftly, clambering up over the 
tracks and into a shadowed cab. 
McKie followed, found the interior 
a tightly cluttered place full of a bit- 
ter oily smell. There were two hard 
metal seats with curved backs 
higher than the head of a seated 
Human or Gowachin. Bahrank al- 



56 



GALAXY 



ready occupied the seat on the left, 
woiicing switches and dials. McKie 
dropped into the other seat. Folding 
arms locked across his chest and 
waist to hold him in place; a brace 
fitted itself to the back of his head. 
Bahrank threw a switch. The door 
through which they’d entered closed 
with a grinding of servomotors and 
the solid clank of locks. 

An ambivalent mood swept over 
McKie. He had always felt faint 
agoraphobia in open places such as 
the area around the rock. But the 
dim interior of this war machine 
with its savage reminders of primi- 
tive times touched an atavistic chord 
in his psyche and he fought an urge 
to claw his way outside. This was a 
trap! 

An odd observation helped him 
overcome the sensation. There was 
glass over the slits which gave them 
their view of the outside. Glass. He 
felt it. Yes, glass. It was common 
stuff in the ConSentiency — strong 
yet fragile. He could see that this 
glass wasn’t very thick. The fierce 
appearance of this machine had to 
be more show than actuality, then. 

Bahrank gave one swift sweeping 
glance to their surroundings, moved 
levers which set the vehicle into 
lurching motion. It emitted a grind- 
ing rumble with an overriding 
whine. 

A track of sorts led from the 
white rock toward the distant city. 
It showed the marks of this 
machine’s recent passage, a road- 
way to follow. Glittering reflections 
danced from bright rocks along the 
track. Bahrank apeared very busy 
with whatever he was doing to 
guide them toward Chu. 

McKie found his own thoughts 



returning to the briefings he’d re- 
ceived on Tandaloor. 

“Once you enter Jedrik’s cell 
you’re on your own.’’ 

Yes . .he felt very much alone, 
his mind a clutter of data which had 
little relationship to any previous 
experience. And this planet could 
die unless he made sense out of that 
data plus whatever else he might 
learn here. 

Alone, alone ... If Dosadi died 
there’d be few sentient watchers. 
The Caleban’s tempdcinetic barrier 
would contain most of that final de- 
structive flare. The Caleban would, 
in fact, feed upon the released 
energy. That was one of the things 
he’d learned from Fannie Mae. One 
consuming blast, a meal for a Cale- 
ban, and BuSab would get its final 
report from a dead agent, would be 
forced to start anew and without the 
most important piece of physical 
evidence — Dosadi . 

The machine beneath McKie 
thundered, rocked and skidded but 
always returned to the track which 
led toward Chu’s distant spires. 

McKie studied the driver covert- 
ly. Bahrank showed uncharacteristic 
behavior for a Gowachin . more 
direct . more Human. That was 
it! His Gowachin instincts had been 
contaminated by contact with Hu- 
mans. Aritch was sure to despise 
that, fear it. Bahrank drove with a 
casual expertise using a complex 
control system. McKie counted 
eight different levers and arms 
which the Gowachin employed. 
Some were actuated by knees, 
others by his head. His hands 
reached out while an elbow de- 
flected a lever. The war machine 
responded.

Bahrank spoke presently without 
taking his attention from driving. 

“We may come under fire on the 
second ledge. There was quite a 
police action down there earlier.” 

McKie stared at him. 

“I thought we had safe passage 
through.” 

“You Rimmers are always pres- 
sing.” 

McKie peered out the slits: 
bushes, barren ground, that lonely 
track they followed. 

Bahrank spoke. 

“You’re older than any Rimmer I 
ever saw before.” 

Aritch’s people had warned 
McKie about this as a basic flaw in 
his cover, the need to conceal the 
subtle signs of age. They’d pro- 
vided him with some geriatric assis- 
tance and an answer to give when 
challenged. He used that answer 
now. 

‘Tt ages you in a hurry out 
here.” 

“It must.” 

McKie felt that something in 
Bahrank’s response eluded him, but 
dared not pursue this. It was an un- 
productive exchange. And there was 
that reference to a ‘police action.’ 
McKie knew that the Rim Rabble, 
excluded from Chu, tried periodic 
raids, most often fruitless. Barbaric! 

“What excuses did you use to 
come out here?” McKie asked. 

Bahrank shot a probing glance at 
him, raised one webbed hand from 
the controls to indicate a handle in 
the roof over his head. The handle’s 
purpose was unknown to McKie 
and he feared he had already be- 
trayed too much ignorance. But 
Bahrank was speaking. 

“Officially, I’m scouting this 



area for any hidden surprises the 
Rimmers may have stored out here. 

I often do that. Unofficially, ev- 
eryone thinks I’ve a secret pond out 
here full of fertile females.” 

A pond ... not a graluz. Again, 
it was a relatively fruitless exchange 
with hidden overtones. 

McKie stared silently ahead 
through a slit. Their dusty track 
made a slow and wide sweep left, 
abruptly angled down onto a narrow 
ledge cut from red rock walls. 
Bahrank put them through a series 
of swift changes in speed: slow, 
fast, slow fast. The red rock walls 
raced past. McKie peered out and 
downward on his side. Far below 
lay jungle verdure and, in the dis- 
tance, the smoke and spires of 
Chu — fluted buildings ranked high 
over dim background cliffs. 

The speed changes appeared pur- 
poseless to McKie. And the dizzy 
drop off of the cliff on his side 
filled him with awe. This narrow 
ledge hugged the cliff, turning as 
the cliff turned — now into shadows 
and now into light. The machine 
roared and groaned around him. 
The smell of oil made his stomach 
heave. And the far away city 
seemed little closer than it had from 
the cliff top, except that it was tal- 
ler, more mysterious in its smoky 
obscurity. 

“Don’t expect any real trouble 
until we reach the first ledge,” 
Bahrank said. 

McKie glanced at him. First 
ledge? Yes, that’d be the first ele- 
vation outside the city’s walls. The 
gorge within which Chu had been 
raised came down to river level in 
broad steps, each one numbered. 
Chu had been anchored to island 



58 



GALAXY 



hills and flats where the river 
slowed and split into many arms. 
And the hills which had resisted the 
river were almost solid iron ore, as 
were many of the flanking ledges. 

“Glad to get off there,” Bahrank 
said. 

Their narrow ledge had turned at 
right angles away from the cliff 
onto a broad ramp which descended 
into grey-green jungle. The growth 
enclosed them in abrupt green 
shadows. McKie, looking out to the 
t side, identified hair fronds and 
broad leaf ficus, giant spikes of 
barbed red which he had never be- 
fore seen. Their track, like the 
' jungle floor, was grey mud. McKie 
looked from side to side: the growth 
appeared an almost equal mixture of 
Terran and Tandaloor interspersed 
[ with many strange plants. 

I Sunlight made him blink as they 
F raced out of the overhanging plants 
onto a plain of tall grass which had 
been trampled, blasted and burned 
by recent violence. He saw a pile of 
wrecked vehicles off to the left, 
twisted shards of metal with, here 
and there, a section of track or a 
wheel aimed at the sky. Some of 
the wrecks looked similar to the 
machine in which he now rode. 

Bahrank skirted a blast hole at an 
angle which gave McKie a view 
into the hole’s depths. Tom bodies 
lay there. Bahrank made no com- 
ment, seemed hardly to notice. 

Abruptly, McKie saw signs of 
movement in the jungle, the flitting 
presence of both Humans and 
Gowachin. Some carried what ap- 
peared to be small weapons — the 
glint of a metal tube, bandoliers of 
bulbous white objects around their 
necks. McKie had not tried to 



memorize all of Dosadi’s weaponry; 
it was, after all, primitive, but he 
reminded himself now that primitive 
weapons had created these scenes of 
destruction. 

Their track plunged again into 
overhanging growth, leaving the 
battlefield behind. Deep green 
shadows enclosed the lurching, 
rumbling machine. McKie, shaken 
from side to side against the 
restraints, carried an odor memory 
with him: deep, bloody musks and 
the beginnings of rot. Their shaded 
avenue made a sharp right turn, 
emerged onto another ledge slashed 
by a plunging cut into which 
Bahrank took them, turning onto 
another cliff-hugging ledge. 

McKie stared across Bahrank 
through the slits. The city was 
nearer now. Their rocking descent 
swept his gaze up and down Chu’s 
towers which lifted like silvery 
organ pipes out of the Council 
Hills. The far cliff was a series of 
misted steps fading into purple 
grey. Chu’s Warrens lay smokey 
and hazed all around the fluted tow- 
ers. And he could make out part of 
the city’s enclosing outer wall. 
Squat forts dotted the wall’s top, 
offset for enfilading fire. The city 
within the wall seemed so tall. 
McKie had not expected it to appear 
so tall . but that spoke of the 
population pressures in a way that 
could not be misunderstood. 

Their ledge ended at another 
battlefield plain strewn with bodies 
of metal and flesh, the death stink 
an inescapable vapor. Bahrank 
spun his vehicle left, right, dodged 
piles of torn equipment, avoided 
craters where mounds of flesh lay 
beneath insect blankets. Ferns and 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



59 



other low growth were beginning to 
spring upright after the monstrous 
trampling. Grey and yellow flying 
creatures sported in the ferntops, 
uncaring of all that death. Aritch’s 
aides had warned McKie that 
Dosadi’s life existed amidst brutal 
excesses, but the actuality sickened 
him. He identified both Gowachin 
and Human forms among the 
sprawled corpses. The sleek green 
skin of a young Gowachin female, 
orange fertility marks prominent 
along her arms, especially revolted 
him. McKie turned sharply away, 
found Bahrank studying him with 
tawny mockery in the shining 
Gowachin eyes. Bahrank spoke as 
he drove. 

“There’s informers everywhere, of 
course, and after this ...” His 
head nodded left and right. 
“. you’ll have to move with 
more caution than you might’ve an- 
ticipated.” 

A brittle explosion punctuated his 
words. Something struck the vehi- 
cle’s armor on McKie’s side. Again 
they were a target. And again. The 
clanging of metal against metal 
came thickly, striking all around 
them, even on the glass over the 
view slits. 

McKie suppressed his shock. 
That thin glass did not shatter. He 
knew about thick shields of tem- 
pered glass, but this put a new di- 
mension on what he’d been told 
about the Dosadi. Quite resourceful 
indeed! 

Bahrank drove with apparent un- 
concern. 

More explosive attack came from 
directly in front of them, flashes of 
orange in the jungle beyond the 
plain. 



“They’re testing,” Bahrank said. 
He pointed to one of the slits. 
“See? They don’t even leave a 
mark on that new glass.” 

McKie spoke from the depths of 
his bitterness. 

“Sometimes you wonder what all 
this proves except that our world 
runs on distrust.” 

“Who trusts?” 

Bahrank’s words had the sound 
of a catechism. 

McKie said: 

“I hope our friends know when 
to stop testing.” 

“They were told we couldn’t take 
more’n eighty millimeters.” 

“Didn’t they agree to pass us 
through?” 

“Even so, they’re expected to t^ 
a few shots if Just to keep me in 
good graces with my superiors.” 

Once more, Bahrank put them 
through a series of dazzling speed 
changes and turns for no apparent 
reason. McKie lurched against the 
restraints, felt bruising pain as an 
elbow hit the side of the cab. An 
explosion directly behind rocked 
them up onto the left track. As they 
bounced, Bahrank spun them left, 
avoided another blast which 
would’ve landed directly on them 
along their previous path. McKie, 
his ears ringing from the explo- 
sions, felt the machine bounce to a 
stop, reverse as more explosions 
erupted ahead. Bahrank spun them 
to the right, then left, once more 
charged full speed ahead right into 
an unbroken wall of jungle. With 
explosions all around, they crashed 
through greenery, turned to the right 
along another shadowed muddy 
track. McKie had lost all sense of 
direction, but the attack had ceased.

GALAXY 



Bahrank slowed them, took a 
deep breath through his ventricles. 

“I knew they’d try that.” 

He sounded both relieved and 
amused. 

McKie, shaken by the brush with 
death, couldn’t find his voice. 

Their shadowy' track snaked 
through the jungle for a space, giv- 
ing McKie time to recover. By 
then, he didn’t know what to say. 
He couldn’t understand Bahrank’s 
amusement, the lack of enduring 
concern' over such violent threat. 

Presently, they emerged onto an 
untouched sloping plain as smooth 
and green as a park lawn. It dipped 
gently downward into a thin screen 
of growth through which McKie 
could see a silver green tracery of 
river. What caught and held 
McKie’s attention, however, was a 
windowless, pock- walled grey for- 
tress which lifted from the plain in 
the middle distance. It towei^ over 
the growth screening the river. But- 
tressed arms reached toward them to 
enclose a black metal barrier. 

“That’s our gate,” Bahrank said. 

Bahrank turned them left, lined 
up with the center of the buttressed 
arms. “Gate Nine and we’re home 
through the tube,” he said. 

McKie nodded. Walls, tubes and 
gates: those were the keys to Chu’s 
defenses. They had “barrier and 
fortress minds” on Dosadi. This 
tube would run beneath the river. 
He tried to place it on the map 
which Aritch’s people had planted 
in his mind. He was supposed to 
know the geography of this place, 
its geology, religions, social pat- 
terns, the intimate layout .of each is- 
land’s walled defenses, but he 
found it hard to locate himself now

on that mental map. He leaned for- 
ward to the slit, peered upward as 
the machine began to gather speed, 
saw the great central spire with its 
horizontal clock. All the hours of 
map briefing snicked into place. 

“Yes, Gate Nine.” 

Bahrank, too busy driving, did 
not reply. 

McKie dropped his gaze to the 
fortress, stifled a gasp. 

The rumbling machine was plung- 
ing downslope at a frightening pace, 
aimed directly toward that black 
metal barrier. At the last instant, 
when it seemed they would crash 
into it, the barrier leaped upward. 
They shot through into a dimly il- 
luminated tube. The gate thundered 
closed behind them. Their machine 
made a racketing sound on metal 
grating beneath the tracks. 

Bahrank slowed them, shifted a 
lever beside him. The machine 
lifted onto wheels with an abrupt 
reduction in noise which made 
McKie feel that he’d been deafened. 
The feeling was heightened by the 
realization that Bahrank had said the 
same thing to him several times. 

“Jedrik says you come from be- 
yond the far mountains. Is that 
true?” 

“Jedrik says it.” He tried to 
make it sound wry, but it came out 
almost questioning. 

Bahrank was concentrating on a 
line of thought, however, as he 
drove them straight down the grat- 
ing floor of the dim tube. 

“There’s a rumor that you Rim- 
mers have started a secret settlement 
back there, that you’re trying to 
build your own city.” 

“An interesting rumor.” 

“Isn’t it, though?” 



The single line of overhead lights 
in the tufc left the cab’s interior 
darker than it’d been outside, il- 
luminated by only the faint reflec- 
tions from instruments and dials. 
But McKie had the odd sensation 
that Bahrank saw him clearly, was 
studying every expression, ^spite 
the impossibility of this, the thought 
persisted. What was behind 
Bahrank’ s probing? 

Why do I feel that he sees right 
through me? 

These disquieting conjectures 
ended as they emerged from the 
tube onto a Warren street. Bahrank 
spun them to the right along a nar- 
row alleyway in deep grey shadows. 

Although he’d seen many rep- 
resentations of these streets, the ac- 
tuality deepened McKie’s feelings 
of misgiving. 

So dirty . oppressive ... so 
many people. They were ev- 
erywhere! 

Bahrank drove slowly now on the 
silent wheels, the tracks raised off 
the paving. The big machine eased 
its way through narrow little streets, 
some paved with stone, some with 
great slabs of dark substance. All 
the streets where shaded by over- 
hanging upper stories whose height 
McKie could not judge through the 
slits. He saw shops barred and 
guarded. An occasional stairway, 
also guarded, led up or down into 
repellant darkness. Only Humans 
occupied these streets, and no 
casual, pedestrian expressions on 
any of them. Jaws were set on grim 
mouths. Hard questioning eyes 
peered at the passing vehicle. Both 
men and woman wore the universal 
dark, one-piece clothing of the 
Labor Pool.

GALAXY 



Noting McKie’s interest, Bahrank 
spoke. 

“This is a Human enclave and 
you have a Gowachin driver.” 

“Can they see us in here?” 

“They know. And there’s trouble 
coming.” 

“Trouble?” 

“Gowachin against Human.” 

This appalled McKie and he 
wondered if this were the source of 
those forebodings which Aritch and 
aides would not explain: destruction 
of Dosadi from within. But Bahrank 
continued: 

“There’s a growing separation 
between Humans and Gowachin, 
worse than it’s ever been. You may 
be the last Human to ride with 
me.” 

Aritch and company had prepared 
McKie for Dosadi’s violence, 
hunger and distrust, but they’d said 
nothing about species against 
species . only that someone they 
refused to name could destroy the 
place from within. What was 
Bahrank trying to say? McKie dared 
not expose his ignorance by probing 
and this inability dismayed him. 

Bahrank, meanwhile, nosed their 
machine out of a narrow passage 
onto a wider street which was 
crowded by carts, each piled with 
greenery. The carts moved aside 
slowly as the armored vehicle ap- 
proached, hatred plain in the eyes 
of the Humans who moved with the 
carts. The press of people as- 
tonished McKie: for every cart (and 
he lost count of them within a 
block) there were at least a hundred 
people crowding around, lifting 
arms high, shouting at the ring of 
people who stood shoulder to 
shoulder around each cart, their 



backs to the piled contents and ob- 
viously guarding those contents. 

McKie, .staring at the carts, re- 
alized with a shocked sense of rec- 
ognition that he was staring at carts 
piled with garbage. The crowds of 
people were buying garbage. 

Again, Bahrank acted the part of 
tour guide. 

“This is called the Street of the 
Hungry. That’s very select garbage, 
the best.” 

McKie recalled one of Aritch ’s 
aides saying there were restau- 
rants in Chu which specialized in 
garbage from particular areas of the 
city, that no poison-free food was 
wasted. 

The passing scene compelled 
McKie’s attention: hard faces, fur- 
tive movements, the hate and thinly 
suppressed violence, all of this im- 
mersed in a normal commercial op- 
eration based on garbage. And the 
numbers of these people! They were 
everywhere around: in doorways, 
guarding and pushing the carts, 
skipping out of Bahrank’s path. 
New smells assaulted McKie’s nos- 
trils, a fetid acridity, a stink such as 
he had never before experienced. 
Another thing surprised him: the 
appearance of antiquity in this War- 
ren. He wondered if all city popula- 
tions crowded by threats from out- 
side took on this ancient appear- 
ance. By Consentient standards, the 
population of Chu had lived here 
(Mily a few generations, but the city 
looked older than any he’d ever 
seen. 

With an abrupt rocking motion, 
Bahrank turned their machine down 
a narrow street, brought them to a 
stop. McKie, looking out the slit on 
his right, saw an arched entry in a 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



63 



f rimy building, a stairway leading 
ownward into gloom. 

“Down there’s where you meet 
Jedrik,’’ Bahrank said. “Down 
those stairs, second door on your 
left. It’s a restaurant.’’ 

“How’ll I know her?” 

“Didn’t they tell you?” 

“I . .” McKie broke off. He’d 
seen pictures of Jedrik during the 
Tandaloor briefings, realized now 
that he was trying to delay leaving 
Bahrank’s armored cocoon. 

Bahrank appeared to sense this. 
“Have no fear, McKie. Jedrik 
will know you. And McKie ...” 
McKie turned to face the 
Gowachin. 

“. go directly to the restau- 
rant, take a seat, wait for Jedrik. 
You’ll not survive long here without 
her protection. Your skin’s dark and 
some Humans prefer even the green 
to the dark in this quarter. They 
remember Pylash Gate here. Fifteen 
years isn’t long enough to erase that 
from their minds.” 

Nothing about a Pylash Gate had 
been included in McKie’s briefings 
and now he dared not ask. 

Bahrank moved the switch which 
opened McKie’s door. Immediately, 
the stink of the street was amplified 
to almost overpowering proportions. 
Bahrank, seeing him hesitate, spoke 
sharply. 

“Go quickly!” 

McKie descended in a kind of 
olafactory daze, found himself 
standing on the side of the street, 
the object of suspicious stares from 
all around. The sight of Bahrank 
driving away was the cutting of his 
last link to the ConSentiency and all 
the familiar things which might pro- 
tect him. 



Never in his long life had McKie 
felt this much alone.

Near sunset there was a fine rain 
which lasted well into darkness, then 
departed on the gorge wind which 
cleared Dosadi’s skies. It left the air 
crystalline, cornices dripping pud- 
dles in the streets. Even the omni- 
present Warren stink was diluted 
and Chu’s inhabitants showed a 
predatory lightness as they moved 
along the streets. 

Returning to headquarters in an 
armored troop carrier which carried 
only his most trusted Gowachin, 
Broey noted the clear air even while 
he wondered at the reports which 
had brought him racing from the 
Council Hills. When he entered the 
conference room, Broey saw that 
Gar already was there standing with 
his back to the dark window which 
looked out on the eastern cliffs. 
Broey wondered how long Gar had 
been there. No sign of recognition 
passed between Gowachin and Hu- 
man, but this only emphasized the 
growing separation of the species. 



64 



GALAXY 




They’d both seen the reports which 
contained that most disturbing 
datum: the killing of a Human dou- 
ble agent under circumstances 
which pointed at Broey himself. 

Broey crossed to the head of the 
conference table, flipped the toggle 
which activated his communicator, 
addressed the screen which only he 
could see. 

‘‘Assemble the Council and link 
for conference.” 

The response came as a distorted 
buzz filtered through scramblers and 
suppressed by a privacy cone. Gar, 
standing across the room, could 
make no sense out of the noises 
coming from the communicator. 

While he waited for the Council 
members to come on the conference 
link, Broey seated himself at the 
communicator, summoned a 
Gowachin aide to the screen and 



spoke in a low voice masked by the 
privacy cone. 

‘‘Start a security check on all 
Humans in positions where they 
might threaten us. Use Plan D.” 

Broey glanced up at Gar. The 
Human’s mouth worked silently. He 
was annoyed by the privacy cone 
and his inability to tell exactly what 
Broey was doing. Broey continued 
speaking to his aide. 

‘‘I’ll want the special force de- 
ployed as I told you earlier . 
Yes . .” 

Gar pointedly turned his back on 
his conversation, stared out at the 
night. 

Broey continued to address his 
aide in the screen. 

‘‘No! We must include even the 
Humans in this conference. Yes, 
that’s the report Gar made to me. 
Yes, I also received that informa- 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



65 




tion. Other Humans can be expected 
to riot and drive out their Gowachin 
neighbors and there’ll be retalia- 
tions. Yes, that was my thought 
when I saw the report.” 

Broey turned off the privacy cone 
and scrambler. Tria had just come 
onto his screen with an override, in- 
terrupting the conversation with his 
security aide. She spoke in a low, 
hurried voice with only a few words 
intelligible to Gar across the room. 
But Broey’s suspicions were becom- 
ing obvious. He heard Tria out, 
then: 

“Yes ... it would be logical to 
suppose that such a killing was 
made to look like Gowachin work 
for ... I see. But the scattered in- 
cidents which . Indeed? Well, 
under the circumstances ...” 

He left the thought incomplete, 
but his words drew a line between 
Human and Gowachin, even at the 
highest levels of his Advisory 
Council. 

“Tria, I must make my own de- 
cisions on this.” 

While Broey was speaking. Gar 
brought up a chair and placed it 
near the communicator, sat down. 
Broey had finished his conversation 
with Tria and restored the privacy 
circuits, however, and even though 
he sat nearby Gar could not pene- 
trate their protective screen. He was 
close enough now, though, to hear 
the buzzing of the privacy system 
and the sound annoyed Gar. He did 
not try to conceal his annoyance. 

Broey saw Gar but gave no indi- 
cation that he approved or disap- 
proved Gar’s nearness. 

“So I understand,” Broey said. 
“Yes . I’ll issue those orders as 
soon as I’ve finished here. 



No . Agreed. That would be 
best.” He closed the circuit. The 
annoying buzz stopped. 

“Jedrik means to set Gowachin 
against Human, Human against 
Gowachin,” Gar said. 

“If so, it’s been a long time in 
secret preparation,” Broey said. 

His words implied many things: 
that there was conspiracy in high 
places, that the situation had 
achieved dangerous momentum 
without being detected, that all of 
the inertial forces could not now 
be anticipated. 

“You expect it to get worse,” 
Gar said. 

“Hopefully.” 

Gar stared at him for a long 
period, then: 

“Yes.” 

It was clear that Broey wanted a 
well-defined condition to develop, 
one which would provide clear pre- 
dictions of the major consequences. 
He was prepared for this. When 
Broey understood the situation to 
his own satisfaction, he’d use his 
own undeniable powers to gain as 
much as possible during a period of 
upset. 

Gar broke the silence. 

“But if we’ve misunderstood Jed- 
rik’s intent ...” 

“It helps us when the innocent 
suffer,” Broey said, paraphrasing 
part of an old axiom which every 
Dosadi knew. 

Gar completed the thought for 
him. 

“But who’s innocent?” 

Before Broey could respond, his 
screen came alight with the assem- 
bled faces of his Council, each face 
in its own little square. Broey con- 
ducted the conference quickly, al-

lowing few interruptions. There 
were no house arrests, no direct ac- 
cusations, but his words and manner 
divided them by species. When he 
was through. Gar imagined the 
scrambling which must be going on 
right then in Chu while the power- 
ful assembled their defenses. 

Without knowing how he sensed 
this. Gar felt that this was exactly 
what Jedrik had wanted and that it’d 
been a mistake for Broey to in- 
crease the tensions. 

After turning off the com- 
municator, Broey sat back and ad- 
dressed himself to Gar with great 
care. 

“Tria tells me that Jedrik cannot 
be found.” 

“Didn’t we expect that?” 

“Perhaps.” Broey puffed his 
jowls. “What I don’t understand is 
how a simple Liaitor could elude 
my people and Tria.” 

“I think we’ve underestimated 
this Jedrik. What if she comes 
from ...” His chin jerked ceiling- 
ward. 

Broey considered this. He’d been 
supervising the interrogation of 
Bahrank at a secure post deep in the 
Council Hills when the summons to 
headquarters had interrupted. The 
accumulating reports indicated a 
kind of trouble ^u had known at 
various times, but never at this 
magnitude. And Bahrank’s informa- 
tion had been disappointing. He’d 
delivered this Rim iirfiltrator named 
McKie to such and such an address. 
(Security had been unable to check 
this in time because of the riots.) 
Bahrank’s beliefs were obvious. 
And perhaps the Rimmers were try- 
ing to build their own city beyond 
the mountains. Broey thought this 



unlikely. His sources in the Rim 
had proved generally trustworthy 
and his special source was always 
trustworthy. Besides, such a venture 
would require gigantic stocks of 
food, all of it subject to exposure in 
the regular accounting. That, after 
all, was the Liaitor function, why 
he had . No, that was not proba- 
ble. The Rim subsisted on the low- 
est of Chu’s leavings and whatever 
could be wrested from Dosadi’s 
poisonous soil. No . Bahrank 
was wrong. This McKie was pecul- 
iar, but in quite another way. And 
Jedrik must’ve knovvn this before 
anyone else . except himself. 
The paramount question remained: 
Who’d helped her? 

Broey sighed. 

“We have a long association. 
Gar. A person of your powers who 
has worked his way from the Rim 
through the Warrens ...” 

Gar understood. He was being 
told that Broey looked upon him 
with active suspicion. There’d never 
been any real trust between them, 
but this was something else: nothing 
openly spoken, nothing direct or 
specific, but the meaning clear. It 
was not even sly; it was merely 
Dosadi. 

For a moment. Gar didn’t know 
which way to turn. There’d always 
been this possibility in his relation- 
ship with Broey, but long accep- 
tance had lulled Gar into a danger- 
ous dependency. Tria had been his 
most valuable counter. He needed 
her now, but she had other, much 
more demanding, duties at this 
juncture. 

Gar realized now that he would 
have to precipitate his own plans, 
calling in all of the debts and de-

pendencies which were his due. He 
was distracted by the sound of 
many people hurrying past in the 
outer hall. Presumably, things were 
coming to a head faster than ex- 
pected. 

Gar stood up, stared vaguely out 
the windows at those dark shadows 
in the night which were the Rim 
cliffs. While waiting for Broey, Gar 
had watched darkness settle there, 
watched the spots of orange appear 
which were the Rim’s cookfires. 
Gar knew those cookfires, knew the 
taste of the food which came from 
them, knew the flesh-dragging dull- 
ness which dominated existence out 
there. Did Broey expect him to flee 
back to that? Broey would be as- 
tonished at the alternatives open to 
Gar. 

“I will leave you now,” Broey 
said. He arose and waddled from 
the room. What he meant was: 
“Don’t be here when I return.” 

Gar continued to stare out the 
windows. He seemed lost in angry 
reverie. Why hadn’t Tria reported 
yet? One of Broey’ s Gowachin 
aides came in, fussed over papers 
on a comer table. 

It was actually no more than five 
minutes that Gar remained standing 
thus. He shook himself presently, 
turned and let himself out of the 
room. 

Scarcely had he set foot in the 
outer passage than a troop of 
Broey’s Gowachin shouldered their 
way past him into the conference 
room. They’d been waiting for him 
to leave. 

Angry with himself for what he 
knew he must do. Gar turned left, 
strode down the hall to the room 
where he knew he’d find Broey. 



Three Gowachin wearing Security 
brassards followed him, but did not 
interfere. Two more Gowachin 
guarded Broey’s door but they hesi- 
tated to stop him. Gar’s power had 
been felt here too long. And Broey, 
not expecting Gar to follow, had 
failed to issue specific orders. Gar 
counted on this. 

Broey, instructing a group of 
Gowachin aides, stood over a table 
cluttered with charts. Yellow light 
from fixtures directly overhead 
played shifting shadows on the 
charts as the aides bent over the 
table and made notes. Broey broke 
off at the intrusion, his surprise ob- 
vious. 

Gar spoke before Broey could 
order him removed. 

“You still need me to keep you 
from making the worst mistake of 
your life.” 

Broey straightened, did not 
speak, but the invitation for Gar to 
continue was there. 

“Jedrik’s playing you like a fine 
instrument. You’re doing precisely 
what she wants you to do.” 

Broey’s cheeks puffed. The shrug 
angered Gar. 

“When I first came here, Broey, 
I took certain precautions to insure 
my continued health should you 
ever consider violence against me.” 

Again, Broey gave that madden- 
ing Gowachin shrug. This was all 
so mundane. Why else did this fool 
Human continue alive and at lib- 
erty? 

“You’ve never been able to dis- 
cover what I did to insure myself 
against you,” Gar said. “1 have no 
addictions. I’m a prudent person 
and, naturally, have means of dying 
before your experts on pain could 



68 



GALAXY 



overcome my reason. I’ve done all 
of the things you might expect of 
me . and something more, some- 
thing you now need desperately to 
know.” 

‘‘I have my own precautions. 
Gar.” 

“Of course, and I admit I don’t 
know what they are.” 

“So what do you propose?” 

Gar gave a little laugh, not quite 
gloating. 

“You know my terms.” 

Broey shook his head from side 
to side, an exquisitely Human ges- 
ture. 

“Share the rule? I’m astonished 
at you. Gar.” 

“Your astonishment hasn’t 
reached its limits. You don’t know 
what I’ve really done.” 

“Which is?” 

“Shall we retire to a more private 
place and discuss it?” 

Broey looked around at his aides, 
waved for them to leave. 

“We will talk here.” 

Gar waited until he heard the 
door close behind him on the last of 
the departing aides. 

“You probably know about the 
death fanatics we’ve groomed in the 
Human enclaves.” 

“We are prepared to deal with 
them.” 

“Properly motivated, fanatics can 
keep great secrets, Broey.” 

“No doubt. Are you now going 
to reveal such a secret?” 

“For years now, my fanatics 
have lived on reduc^ rations, pre- 
serving and exporting their surplus 
rations to the Rim. We have 
enough, megatons of food out there. 
With a whole planet in which to 
hide it, you’ll never find it. City 



food, every bit of it and we 
will . .” 

“Another city!” 

“More than that. Every weapon 
the city of Chu has, we have.” 

Broey ’s ventricle lips went almost 
green with anger. 

“So you never really left the 
Rim?” 

“The Rim-bom carmot forget.” 

“After aU that Chu has done for 
you . .” 

“I’m glad you didn’t mention 
blasphemy.” 

“But the Gods of the Veil gave 
us a mandate!” 

“Divide and rule, subdivide and 
rule even more powerfully, frag- 
ment and rule absolutely.” 

“That’s not what I meant.” 
Broey breathed deeply several times 
to restore his calm. “One city and 
only one city. That is our man- 
date.” 

“But the other city will be 
built.” 

“Will it?” 

“We’ve dug in the factories to 
provide our own weqrons arrd food. 
If you move ag^nst our pec^le in- 
side Chu, we’ll come at you ftom 
the outside, shatter your walls 
arrd . .” 

“What do you propose?” 

“Open cooperation for a separa- 
tion of the species, one city for 
Gowachin, one for Human. What 
you do in Chu will be your own 
business then, but I’ll tell you that 
we of the new City will rid our- 
selves of the Demopol and its aris- 
tocracy.” 

“You’d create another aristo- 
cracy?” 

“Perhaps. But my people will die 
for the vision of freedom we share. 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



69 



We no longer provide our bodies 
for Chu!” 

“So that’s why your fanatics are 
all Rim-bom.” 

“I see that you don’t yet under- 
stand, Broey. My people are not 
merely Rim-bom; they are willing, 
even eager to die for their vision.” 

Broey considered this. It was a 
difficult concept for a Gowachin, 
whose Graluz guilt was always 
transformed into a profound respect 
for the survival drive. But he saw 
where Gar’s words must lead and 
he built an image in his mind of 
fleshly Human waves throwing 
themselves onto all opposition with- 
out inhibitions about pain, death or 
survival in any respect. They might 
very well capture Chu. The idea 
that countless Rim immigrants lived 
within Chu’s walls in readiness for 
such sacrifice filled him with deep 
disquiet. It required strong self-con- 
trol to conceal this reaction. He did 
not for an instant doubt Gar’s story. 
It was just the kind of thing this 
dry-fleshed Rimmer would do. But 
why was Gar revealing this now? 

“Did Jedrik order you to prepare 
me for . .” 

“Jedrik isn’t part of our plan. 
She complicates matters for us, but 
the kind of upset she’s igniting is 
Just the sort of thing we can exploit 
better than you.” 

Broey weighted this with what he 
knew about Gar, found it valid as 
far as it went, but it still did not an- 
swer the basic question. 

“Why?” 

“I’m not ready to sacrifice my 
people,” Gar said. 

TTiat had the ring of partial tmth. 
Gar had shown many times that he 
could make hard decisions. But 



numbered among his fanatic hordes 
there doubtless were certain skills 
he’d prefer not losing . not yet. 
Yes, that was the way Gar’s mind 
worked. And Gar would know the 
profound respect for life which ma- 
tured in a Gowachin breast after the 
weeding frenzy. Gowachin, too, 
could make bloody decisions, but 
the guilt ... oh, the guilt . Gar 
counted on the guilt. Perhaps he 
counted too much. 

“Surely, you don’t expect me to 
take an open and active part in your 
Rim city project?” 

“If not open, then passive.” 
“And you insist on sharing the 
rule of Chu?” 

“For the interim.” 

“Impossible!” 

“In substance if not in name.” 
“You have been my advisor.” 
“Will you precipitate violence 
between us with Jedrik standing 
there to pick up whatever she can 
gain from us?” 

“Ahhhhhh ...” Broey nodded. 
So that was it! Gar was not part 
of this Jedrik thing. Gar was afraid 
of Jedrik, more rfraid of her than 
he was of Broey. This gave Broey 
cause for caution. Gar was not eas- 
ily made fearful. What did he know 
of this Jedrik that Broey did not 
know? But now there was a suffi- 
cient reason for compromise. The 
unanswered questions could be an- 
swered later. 

“You will continue as my chief 
advisor,” Broey said. 

It was acceptable. Gar signified 
his consent by a curt nod. 

The compromise left an empty 
feeling in Broey’s digestive nodes, 
though. Gar knew he’d been manip- 
ulate to reveal his fear of Jedrik. 



70 



GALAXY 



Gar could be certain that Broey 
would try to neutralize the Rim city 
project. But the magnitude of Gar’s 
plotting went far beyond expecta- 
tions, leaving too many unknowns. 
One could not make accurate deci- 
sions with insufficient data. Gar had 
given away information without re- 
ceiving an equal exchange. That 
was not like Gar. Or was that a cor- 
rect interpretation of what’d hap- 
pened here? Broey knew he had to 
explore this, risking one piece of 
accurate information as bait. 

“There’s been a recent increase 
of mystical experiences by 
Gowachin in the Warrens.” 

“You know better than try that 
religious nonsense on me!” 

Gar was actually angry. 

Broey concealed his amusement. 
Gar did not know then (or did not 
accept) that the God of the Veil 
sometimes spoke to his flock, that 
God spoke truly and accurately to 
his annointed and would answer 
some questions. 

Much had been revealed here, 
more than Gar suspected. Bahrank 
had been right. And Jedrik would 
have to know about Gar’s Rim city. 
It was possible that Jedrik wanted 
Broey to know and had maneuvered 
Gar into revealing the plot. If Gar 
saw this, that would be enough to 
make him fearful. 

Why didn’t the God reveal this to 
me? Broey wondered. Am I being 
tested? 

Yes, that had to be the answer, 
because there was one thing certain 
now: 

This time, I'll do what the God 
advises.

It required a moment after 
Bahrank drove away for McKie to 
recover his sense of purpose. The 
buildings rose tall and massive over 
him, but through a quirk of this 
Warren’s growth, an opening to the 
west allowed a spike of the silvery 
afternoon sunlight to slant into the 
narrow street. The light threw hard 
shadows on every object, accented 
the pressure of Human movement. 
McKie did not like the way people 
looked at him; as though everyone 
measured him for some private 
gain. 

Slowly, McKie pressed through 
the passing throng to the arched en- 
try, observing all he could without 
seeming to do so. After all those 
years in BuSab, all of the training 
and experience which had qualified 
him for such a delicately powerful 
agency, he possessed superb knowl- 
edge of the ConSentiency’s species. 
He drew on that knowledge now, 
sensing the powerful secrecy which 



OOSADI EXPERIMENT 



71 



governed these people. Unfortunate- 
ly, his experience also was replete 
with knowledge of what species 
could do to species, not to mention 
what a species could do to itself. 
The Humans around him reminded 
him of nothing more than a mob 
about to explode. 

Moving with a constant readiness 
to defend himself, he went down a 
short flight of stairs into cool 
shadows where the foot traffic was 
lighter but the smells of rot and 
mold were more pronounced. 

Second door on the left. 

He went to the doorway where 
Bahrank had directed him, peered 
into the opening: another stairway 
down. Somehow, this dismayed 
him. The picture of Chu growing in 
his mind was not at all what 
Aritch’s people had drawn. Had 
they deliberately misled him? If so, 
why? Was it possible they really 
didn’t understand their monster? The 
array of answers to his questions 
chilled him. What if a few of the 
observers sent here by Aritch’s 
people had chosen to capitalize on 
whatever power Dosadi provided? 

In all of his career, McKie had 
never before come across a world 
so completely cut off from the rest 
of the universe. This planet was 
alone, without many of the 
amenities which graced the other 
Consentient worlds: no common 
access to jumpdoors, no concourse 
of the known species, none of the 
refined pleasures nor the sophisti- 
cated traps which occupied the den- 
izens of other worlds. Dosadi had 
developed its own ways. And the 
instructors on Tandaloor had re- 
turned time and again to that con- 
stant note of warning — that these 



lonely primitives would take over 
the ConSentiency if released upon 
the universe. 

“Nothing restrains them. 
Nothing.’’ 

That was, perhaps, an overstate- 
ment. Some things did restrain the 
Dosadi physically. But they were 
not held back by the conventions or 
mores of the ConSentiency. Any- 
thing could be purchased here, any 
forbidden depravity which the im- 
agination might conceive. This idea 
haunted McKie. He thought of this 
and of the countless substances to 
which many Dosadi were addicted. 
The power leverage such things 
gave to the unprincipaled few was 
terrifying. 

He dared not pause here wrestling 
with his indecisions, though. McKie 
stepped into the stairwell with a 
boldness which he did not feel, fol- 
lowing Bahrank’s directions because 
he had no choice. The bottom land- 
ing was a wider space in deep 
shadows, one dim light on a black 
door. Two Humans dozed in chairs 
beside the door while a third squat- 
ted beside them with what appeared 
to be a crude projectile weapon in 
his hands. 

“Jedrik summoned me,’’ McKie 
said. 

The guard with the weapon nod- 
ded for him to proceed. 

McKie made his way past them, 
glanced at the weapon: a length of 
pipe with a metal box at the baek 
and a flat trigger atop the box held 
by the guard’s thumb. McKie al- 
most missed a step. The weapon 
was a dead-man bomb! Had to be. 
If that guard’s thumb relaxed for 
any reason, the thing no doubt 
would explode and kill everyone in 



72 



GALAXY 



the stairwell. McKie glanced at the 
two sleepers. How could they sleep 
in such circumstances? 

The black door with its one dim 
light commanded his attention now. 
A strong smell of highly seasoned 
cooking dominated the other stinks 
here. McKie saw that it was a 
heavy door with a glittering spyeye 
at face level. The door opened at 
his approach. He stepped through 
into a large low room crowded 
. jammed! with people seated 
on benches at trestle tables. There 
was barely room for passage be- 
tween the benches. And everywhere 
that McKie looked he saw people 
spooning food into their mouths 
from small bowls. Waiters and 
waitresses hurried through the nar- 
row spaces slapping down bowls 
and removing empties. 

The whole scene was presided 
over by a fat woman seated at a 
small desk on a platform at his left. 
She was positioned in such a way 
that she commanded the entry door, 
the entire room and swinging doors 
at the side through which the serv- 
ing people flowed back and forth. 
She was a monstrous woman and 
she sat her perch as though she had 
never been anywhere else. Indeed, 
it was easy for McKie to imagine 
that she could not move from her 
position. Her arms were bloated 
where they squeezed from the con- 
fines of short-sleeved green cov- 
eralls. Her ankles hung over her 
shoe tops in folds. 

Take a seat and wait. 

Bahrank’s warning had been clear. 

McKie looked for an opening on 
the benches. Before he could move, 
the fat woman spoke in a squeaky 
voice. 



“Your name?” 

McKie’ s gaze darted toward those 
beady eyes in their folds of fat. 

“McKie.” 

“Thought so.” 

She raised a dimpled finger. 
From somewhere in the crush a 
young boy came hurrying. He could 
not have been over nine years old 
but his eyes were cold with adult 
wisdom. He looked up to the fat 
woman for instructions. 

“This is the one. Guide him.” 

The boy turned and, without 
looking to see if McKie followed, 
hurried down the narrow pathway 
where the doors swung back and 
forth to permit the passage of serv- 
ing people. Twice, McKie was al- 
most run down by waiters. His 
guide was able to anticipate the 
opening of every door and skipped 
aside. 

At the end of this passage, there 
was another solid black door with 
spyeye. The door opened onto a 
short passage with closed doors on 
both sides, a blank wall at the end. 
The blank wall slid aside for them 
and they descended into a narrow, 
rock-lined way lighted by widely 
spaced bulbs overhead. The walls 
were damp and evil smelling. Occa- 
sionally, there were wide places 
with guards. They passed through 
several guarded doors, climbed up 
and went down. McKie lost track of 
the turns, the doors and guard 
posts. After a time, they climbed to 
another short hallway with doors 
along its sides. The boy opened the 
second door on the right, waited for 
McKie to enter, closed the door. It 
was all done without words. McKie 
heard the boy’s footsteps recede. 

The room was small and dimly 

73 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



lighted by windows high in the wall 
opposite the door. A trestle table 
about two meters long with benches 
down both sides and a chair at each 
end almost filled the space. The 
walls were grey stone and un- 
adorned. McKie worked his way 
around to the chair at the far end, 
sat down. He remained seated there 
silently for several minutes, absorb- 
ing this place. It was cold in the 
room: Gowachin temperature. One 
of the high windows behind him 
was open a crack and he could hear 
street noises: a heavy vehicle pass- 
ing, voices arguing, many feet. The 
sense of the Warren pressing in 
upon this room was very strong. 
Nearer at hand from beyond the 
single door, he heard crockery 
banging and an occasional hiss as of 
steam. 

Presently, the door opened and a 
tall, slender woman entered, slip- 
ping through the door at minimal 
opening. For a moment as she 
turned, the light from the windows 
concentrated on her face, then she 
sat down at the end of the right 
hand bench, dropping into the 
shadows. 

McKie had never before seen 
such hard features on a woman. She 
was brittle rock with ice crystal 
eyes of palest blue. Her black hair 
was closely cropped into a stiff bris- 
tle. He repressed a shudder. The 
rigidity of her body amplified the 
hard expression on her face. It was 
not the hardness of suffering, not 
that alone, but something far more 
determined, something anchored in 
a kind of agony which might 
explode at the slightest touch. On a 
Consentient world where the geriat- 
ric arts were available she could 



have been any age between thirty- 
five and one hundred and thirty- 
five. The dim light into which she 
had seated herself complicated his 
scrutiny but he suspected she was 
younger than thirty-five. 

“So you are McKie.” 

He nodded. 

‘‘You’re fortunate Adril’s people 
got my message. Broey’s already 
searching for you. I wasn’t warned 
that you were so dark.” 

He shrugged. 

‘‘Bahrank sent word that you 
could get us all killed if we’re not 
careful with you. He says you don’t 
have even rudimentary survival 
training.” 

This surprised McKie, but he 
held his silence. 

She sighed. ‘‘At least you have 
the good sense not to protest. 
Well . welcome to Dosadi, 
McKie. Periiaps I’ll be able to keep 
you alive long enough for you to be 
of some use to us.” 

Welcome to Dosadi! 

‘‘I’m Jedrik as you doubtless al- 
ready know.” 

‘‘I recognize you.” 

This was only partly true. None 
of the representations he’d seen had 
conveyed the ruthless brutality 
which radiated from her. 

A hard smite flickered on her 
lips, was gone. 

‘‘You don’t respond when I wel- 
come you to our planet.” 

McKie shook his head. Aritch’s 
people had been specific in their in- 
junction: 

“She doesn’t know your origin. 
Under no circumstances may you 
reveal to her that you come from 
beyond the God Wall. It could be 
immediately fatal.” 



74 



GALAXY 



McKie continued to stare silently 
at her. 

A colder look came over Jedrik’s 
features, something in the muscles 
at the corners of the mouth and 
eyes. 

“We shall see. Now: Bahrank 
says you carry a wallet of some 
kind and that you have currency 
sewn into your clothing. First, hand 
me the wallet.” 

My toolkit? 

She reached an open hand toward 
him. 

“I’ll warn you once, McKie. If I 
get up and walk out of here you’ll 
not live more than two minutes.” 

Every muscle quivering protest, 
he slipped the toolkit from its pock- 
et, extended it. 

“And I’ll warn you, Jedrik: I’m 
the only person who can open this 
without being killed and the con- 
tents destroyed.” 

She accepted the toolkit, turned 
its flat substance over in her hands. 

“Really?” 

McKie had begun to interest her 
in a new way. He was less than 
she’d expected, yet more. Naive, of 
course, incredibly naive. But she’d 
already known that of the people 
from beyond the God Wall. It was 
the most suitable explanation. 
Something was profoundly wrong in 
the Dosadi situation. The people 
beyond the Veil would have to send 
their best here. This McKie was 
their best? Astonishing. * 

She arose, went to the door, 
rapped once. 

McKie watched her pass the tool- 
kit to someone outside, heard a 
low-voiced conversation, neither 
half of it intelligible. In a flashing 
moment of indecision, he’d consid- 



ered trying for some of the toolkit’s 
protective contents. Something in 
Jedrik’s manner and the accumula- 
tion of unknowns all around had 
stopped him. 

Jedrik returned to her seat empty- 
handed. She stared at him a mo- 
ment, head cocked to once side, 
then: 

“I’ll say several things to you. In 
a way, this is a test. If you fail, I 
guarantee you’ll not survive long on 
Dosadi. Understood?” 

When McKie failed to respond, 
she pounded a fist on the table. 

“Understood?” 

“Say what you have to say.” 

“Very well. It’s obvious to me 
that those who instructed you about 
Dosadi warned you not to reveal 
your true origin. Yet, most of those 
who’ve seen you and all of those 
who’ve talked to you for more than 
a few seconds suspect you’re not 
one of us — not from Chu, not from 
the Rim, not from anywhere on 
Dosadi.” Her voice took on a new 
harshness. “But I know it. Let me 
tell you, McKie, that there’s not 
even a child among us who’s failed 
to realize that the people imprisoned 
on Dosadi did not originate here!” 

McKie stared at her, shocked. 

Imprisoned. 

As she spoke, he knew she was 
telling him the truth. Why hadn’t 
Aritch or the others warned him? 
Why hadn’t he seen this for him- 
self? Since Dosadi was poison to 
both Human and Gowachin, re- 
jected them, of course they’d know 
they hadn’t originated here. 

She gave him time to absorb this 
before continuing. 

“There are others among us from 
your realm, perhaps some we’ve not

identified, better trained. But I was 
taught to act only on certainty. Of 
you I’m certain. You do not origi- 
nate on Etosadi. I’ve put it to the 
question and I’ve the present con- 
firmation of my own senses. You 
come from beyond the God Wall. 
Your actions with Bahrank, with 
Adril, with me . .” She shook her 
head sadly. 

Aritch set me up for this! 

This thought brought back a re- 
current question which continued to 
nag McKie: BuSab’s discovery of 
the Dosadi experiment. Were the 
Gowachin that clumsy? Would they 
make such slips? The original plan 
to conceal this project must have 
been extensive. Yet, key facts had 
leaked to BuSab agents. McKie felt 
overwrought from asking himself 
the same questions over and over 
without satisfaction. And now, Jed- 
rik’s pressures compounded the 
burden. The only suitable answer 
was that Aritch’s people had done 
everything with the intent of putting 
him in this position. They’d delib- 
erately leaked information about 
Dosadi. And McKie was their 
target. 

To what purpose? 

“Can we be overheard?’’ he 
asked. 

“Not by my enemies on 
Dosadi.” 

He considered this. She’d left 
open the question of whether any- 
one from beyond the God Wall 
might eavesdrop. McKie pursed his 
lips with indecision. She’d taken his 
toolkit with such ridiculous 
ease . yet, what choice had he? 
They wouldn’t get anything from 
the kit and someone out there, one 
of Jedrik’s underlings, would die. 



That could have a useful effect on 
Jedrik. He decided to play for time. 

“There’re many things I could 
tell you. So many things. I hardly 
know where to begin.” 

“Begin by telling me how you 
came through the God Wall.” 

Yes, he might be able to confuse 
her with a loose description of 
Calebans and jumpdoors. Nothing 
in her Dosadi experience could’ve 
prepared Jedrik for such 
phenomena. McKie took a deep 
breath. Before he could speak there 
was a rap on the door. 

Jedrik raised a hand for silence, 
leaned over and opened the door. A 
skinny young man with large eyes 
beneath a high forehead and thin 
blonde hair slipped through, placed 
McKie’ s toolkit on the table in front 
of Jedrik. 

“It wasn’t very difficult,” he 
said. 

McKie stared at the kit in shock. 
It lay open with all of its contents 
displayed in perfect order. 

Jedrik gestured the youth to the 
seat opposite her. She reached for 
a raygen. 

McKie could no longer contain 
himself. 

“Careful! That’s dangerous!” 

“Be still, McKie. You know 
nothing of danger.” 

She removed the stim, examined 
it, replaced it neatly, looked at the 
young man. 

“All right, Stiggy. Tell me.” 

The youth begaii removing the 
items from the toolkit one by one, 
handling each with a knowledgeable 
correctness, speaking rapidly. 

McKie tried hard to follow the 
conversation, but it was in a code 
he could not understand. The ex- 



76 



GALAXY 



pressions on their faces were 
eloquent enough, however. They 
were elated. Whatever Stiggy was 
saying about the dangerous toys in 
McKie’s toolkit, his revelations pro- 
fited both of them. 

The uncertainties which had 
begun during McKie’s ride with 
Bahrank reached a new intensity. 
The feeling had built up in him 
like a sickness. He’d wondered for 
a time if he might be the victim 
of some new disease native to 
Dosadi. It could not be the planet’s 
food because he’d eaten nothing 
yet. The realization came over him 
as he watched Jedrik and Stiggy 
that his reactions were his own 
reasoning system trying to reject 
something, some assumption or set 
of assumptions which he’d accepted 
without question. He tried to empty 
his mind, not asking any questions 
in particular. Let come into his 
awareness what may. It would all 
have a fresh appraisal. 

Dosadi requires you to be coldly 
brutal in all of your decisions. No 
exceptions. 

Well . he’d let go of the tool- 
kit in the belief that someone would 
die trying to open it. But he’d is- 
sued a warning. That warning 
could’ve helped them. Probably did. 

/ must become exactly like them 
or I cannot survive ... let alone 
succeed. 

At last, McKie felt Aritch’s fear 
of Dosadi, understood the 
Gowachin desperation. What a ter- 
rible training ground for the recog- 
nition and use of power! 

Jedrik and Stiggy finished their 
coded conversation over the toolkit. 
Stiggy closed the kit, arose with it 
in one hand, speaking at last in 



words that McKie understood. 

“Yes, we must lose no time.’’ 

Stiggy left with the kit. 

Jedrik faced McKie. The toolkit 
and its contents had helped answer 
the most obvious question about 
McKie and his kind. The people 
beyond the God Wall were the de- 
generate descendants of those who’d 
invented such devices. It was the 
only workable explanation. She felt 
almost sorry for this poor fool. But 
that was not a permissable emotion. 
He must be made to understand that 
he had no choice but to obev her. 

“Now, McKie, you will answer 
all of my questions.’’ 

“Yes.” 

It was utter submission and she 
knew it. 

“When you’ve satisfied me in all 
matters,” she said, “then we’ll eat 
and I’ll take you to a place where 
you’ll be reasonably safe.”

DOSADI EXPERIMENT

An angry Broey, full out and un- 
inhibited anger, was something to 
see and quite a number of his 
Gowachin aides had seen this emo- 
tional display during the night. It 
was now barely dawn. Broey had 
not slept in two days; but the fourth 
group of his aides stood before him 
in the sanctum to receive the full 
spate of his displeasure. The word 
had already gone out through their 
ranks and they, like the others, did 
not try to hide their fear or their anx- 
ious eagerness to restore them- 
selves in Broey’s good graces. 

Broey stood near the end of the 
long table where, earlier, he had 
met with Gar and Tria. The only 
visible sign of his long sleepless 
hours was a slight pitting of the 
fatty nodes between his ventricles. 
His eyes were as sharp as ever and 
his voice had lost none of its bite. 

“What I’d like explained is how 
this could happen without a word of 
warning. And it’s not just that we 
failed to detect this, but that we 
continued to grind out complacent 
reports, reports which went exactly 
contrary to what actually was hap- 
pening.’’ 

The aides massed at the other end 
of the table, all standing, all fidget- 
ing, were not assuaged by Broey’s 
use of “we.’’ THEY heard him 
clearly. He was saying; “You! 
You! You!” 

“I will be satisfied by nothing 
less than an informant,’’ Broey 
said. “I want a Human informant, 
either from Qiu or from the Rim. I 
don’t care how you get this infor- 
mant. We must find that store of 
city food. We must find where they 
have started their blasphemous Rim 
city.” 



One of his aides, a slender young 
Gowachin in the front rank, ven- 
tured a cautious question which had 
been repeated several times by other 
chastened aides during the ni^t. 

“If we move too strongly against 
Humans in the Warrens won’t that 
feed the unrest that ...” 

“We’ll have more riots, more 
turning of Gowachin against Human 
and Human against Gowachin,” 
Broey agreed. “That’s a conse- 
quence we are prepared to accept.” 

This time they understood that 
Broey used the royal “we.” Broey 
would accept the consequences. 
Some of his aides, however, were 
not ready to accept a war between 
the species within the city’s walls. 
One of the aides farther back in the 
ranks raised an arm. 

“Perhaps we should use only 
Human troops in the Warrens. If 
we . .” 

“Who would that fool?” Broey 
demanded. “We have taken the 
proper steps to maintain our hold on 
Chu. You have one task and one 
task only: find that store of food 
and those hidden factories. Unless 
we find them we’re finished. Now, 
get out of here. I don’t want to see 
any of you until you can report suc- 
cess!” 

They filed out silently. 

Broey stood looking down at the 
blank screen of his communicator. 
Alone at last, he allowed his shoul- 
der to slump, breathed heavily 
through both mouth and ventricles. 

What a mess! What a terrible 
mess. 

He knew in his node of nodes 
that he was behaving precisely as 
Jedrik wanted him to behave. She 
had left him no alternatives. He 



78 



GALAXY 



could only admire her handling of 
the situation while he waited for the 
opening which he knew must come. 
But what a magnificent intellect op- 
erated in that Human head. And a 
female at that! Gowachin females 
never developed such qualities. 
Only on the Rim were Gowachin 
females used as other than breeders. 
Human females, on the other hand, 
never ceased to amaze him. This 
Jedrik possessed real leadership 
qualities. Whether she was the one 
to take over the Electorship re- 
mained to be seen. 

Broey found himself recalling 
those first moments of terrible 
awareness in the Graluz. Yes, this 
was the way of the world. If one 
chose the survivors by other than a 
terrible testing process, all would 
die. It would be the end of both 
species. At least, it would be the 
end of them on Dosadi and only 
Dosadi mattered. 

He felt bereft, though. He felt 
betrayed by his God. \V^y had God 
failed to warn him? And when 
questioned, how could God respond 
that only evil could penetrate the 
mind of a fanatic? Wasn’t God om- 
nipotent? Could any awareness be 
closed to God? How could God be 
God then? 

/ am your God! 

He could never forget that voice- 
less voice reverberating in his head. 

Was that a lie?

— From a clandestine document 
circulated on Dosadi 



It was dark when a disguised Jed- 
rik and undisguised McKie emerged 
onto the streets. She led them down 
narrow passages, her mind full of 
things McKie had revealed. Jedrik 
wore a blonde wig and puff-out dis- 
guise which made her appear heavy 
and hunched. 

As they passed an open court- 
yard, McKie heard music. He al- 
most stumbled. The music came 
from a small orchestra — delicate 
tympany, soft strings and a rich 
chorus of wind instruments. He did 
not recognize the melody, but it 
moved him more deeply than any 
other music of his experience. It 
was as though the music were 
played only for him. Aritch and 
company had said nothing about 
such magnificent music here. 

People still thronged the streets in 
numbers which astonished him. But 
now they appeared to pay him little 
notice. 

Jedrik kept part of her attention 
on McKie, noting the fools with 
their musical dalliance, noting how 
few people there were on the 
streets — little more than her own 
patrols in this quarter. She’d ex- 
pected that, but the actuality held an 
eerie mood in the dim and scattered 
illumination from lighted comers. 

79 



She had debated providing McKie 
with a crude disguise, but he ob- 
viously didn’t have the cunning to 
carry off the double deception she 
required. She’d begun to sense a 
real intelligence in him, though. 
McKie was an enigma. Why had he 
never encountered the opportunities 
to sharpen that intelligence? Sensing 
the sharpness in him, she could not 
put off the thought that she had 
missed something vital in his ac- 
counts of that social entity which he 
called the ConSentiency. Whether 
this failure came from actual con- 
cealment by McKie or through his in- 
adequacies she was not yet willing 
to judge. The enigma set her on 
edge. And the mood in the streets 
did nothing to ease her emotions. 
She was glad when they crossed the 
line into the area completely con- 
trolled by her own personal cell. 

The bait having been trailed 
through the streets by one who 
would appear a tame underling, Jed- 
rik allowed herself a slight relaxa- 
tion. Broey would have learned by 
this time about the killing of Tria’s 
double agent. He would react to 
that and to the new bait. It was al- 
most time for phase two of her de- 
sign for Broey. 

McKie followed her without 
question, acutely aware of every 
strange glance cast their way. He 
was emptied of all resistance, know- 
ing he could not survive if he failed 
to follow Jedrik through the smelly 
repel I ant darkness of her streets. 

The food from the restaurant sat 
heavily in his stomach. It had been 
tasty: a stew of odd shapes of 
shredded greenery, and steaming 
hot. But he could not shake the re- 
alization that his stew had been 



compounded of someone’s garbage. 

Jedrik had left him very little. 
She hadn’t learned of the Taprisiot 
or the bead in his stomach which 
might (or might not) link him to the 
powers of the ConSentiency if he 
died. She had not learned of the 
standard BuSab implantation de- 
vices which amplified his senses. 
And, oddly, she had not explored 
many of his revelations about 
BuSab. She’d seemed much more 
interested in the money hidden 
about his person and had taken pos- 
session of all of it. She’d examined 
the currency carefully. 

“This is real.’’ 

He wasn’t sure but he thought 
she’d been surprised. 

“This was given to you before 
you were sent to Dosadi?’’ 

“Yes.” 

She was a while absorbing the 
implications, but appeared satisfied. 
She’d given him a few small 
currency tokens from her own 
pockets. 

“Nobody’ll bother you for these. 
If you need anything, ask. We may 
be able to gratify some of your 
needs.” 

It was still dark, lighted only by 
illumination at comers, when they 
came to the address Jedrik sought. 
Grey light suffused the street. A 
young Human male of about ten 
squatted with his back against the 
stone wall at the building’s comer. 
As Jedrik and McKie approached, 
he sprang up, alert. He nodded once 
to Jedrik. 

She did not acknowledge, but by 
some hidden signal the boy knew 
she had received his message. He 
relaxed once more against the wall. 

When McKie looked back a few 



80 



GALAXY 



paces beyond where the boy had 
signalled, he was gone. No sound, 
no sign . just gone. 

Jedrik stopped at a shadowed 
entry way. It was barred by an 
openwork metal gate flanked by two 
armed guards. The guards opened 
the gate without words. Beyond the 
gate there was a large covered 
courtyard illuminated by glowing 
tubes on right and left. TTiree of its 
sides were piled to the courtyard 
cover with boxes of various 
sizes — some taller than a Human 
and narrow; others short and fat. 
Set into the stacks as though part of 
the courtyard’s walls was one 
narrow passage leading to a metal 
door opposite the gateway. 

McKie touched Jedrik’ s arm. 

“What’s in the boxes?” 

“Weapons.” She spoke as 
though to a cretin. 

The metal door was opened from 
within. Jedrik led McKie into a 
large room at least two stories tall. 
The door clanged shut behind them. 
McKie sensed several Humans 
along the courtyard wall on both 
sides of him but his attention had 
been captured by something else. 

Dominating the room was a 
gigantic cage suspended from the 
ceiling. Its bars sparkled and shim- 
mered with hidden energies. A sin- 
gle Gowachin male sat cross-legged 
in a hammock at the cage’s center. 
McKie had seldom seen a Consen- 
tient Gowachin that aged. His nose 
crest was fringed by flaking yellow 
crusts. Heavy wrinkles wormed 
their way beneath watery eyes be- 
ginning to glaze with the degenera- 
tion which often blinded Gowachin 
who lived too long away from wa- 
ter. His body had a slack appear- 



ance with loose muscles and pitted 
indentations along the nodes be- 
tween his ventricles. The hammock 
suspended him off the cage floor 
and that floor shimmered with vol- 
atile energies. 

Jedrik paused, divided her atten- 
tion between McKie and the old 
Gowachin. She seemed to expect a 
particular reaction from McKie, but 
he wasn’t certain she found what 
she sought. 

McKie stood a moment in silent 
examination of the Gowachin. Pris- 
oner? What was the significance of 
that cage and its shimmering ener- 
gies? Presently, he glanced around 
the room, recording the space. Six 
armed Human males flanked the 
door through which he and Jedrik 
had entered. A remarkable assort- 
ment of objects crammed the 
room’s walls, some with purpose 
unknown to him but many recog- 
nizable as weapons: spears and 
swords, flame-throwers, garrish ar- 
mor, bombs, pellet projectors. 

Jedrik moved a pace closer to the 
cage. The occupant stared back at 
her with faint interest. She cleared 
her throat. 

“Greetings, Pcharky. I have 
found my key to the God Wall.” 

The old Gowachin remained si- 
lent, but McKie thought he saw a 
sparkle of interest in the glazed 
eyes. 

Jedrik shook her head slowly, 
then: “I have a new datum, 
Pcharky. The Veil of Heaven was 
created by creatures called Cale- 
bans. They appear to us as suns.” 

Pcharky’s glance flickered to 
McKie, back to Jedrik. The 
Gowachin knew the source of her 
new datum. 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



81 



McKie renewed his speculations 
about the old Gowachin. That cage 
must be a prison, its walls enforced 
by dangerous energies. Bahrank had 
spoken of conflict between the 
species. Humans controlled this 
room. Why did they imprison a 
Gowachin? Or. .was this caged 
Gowachin, this Pcharky, another 
agent from Tandaloor? With a tight- 
ening of his throat, McKie won- 
dered if his own fate might be to 
live out his days in such a cage. 

Pcharky grunted, then: 

“The God Wall is like this cage 
but more powerful.” 

His voice was a husky croaking, 
the words clear Galach with an ob- 
vious Tandaloor accent. McKie, his 
fears reinforced, glanced at Jedrik, 
found her studying him. She spoke. 

“Pcharky has been with us for a 
long time, very long. There’s no 
telling how many people he has 
helped to escape from Dosadi. 
Soon, I may persuade him to be of 
service to me.” 

McKie found himself shocked to 
silence by the possibilities glimpsed 
through her words. Was Dosadi in 
fact an investigation of the Caleban 
mystery? Was that the secret 
Aritch’s people concealed here? 
McKie stared at the shimmering 
bars of Pcharky’s cage. Like the 
God Wall? But the God Wall was 
enforced by a Caleban. 

Once more, Jedrik looked at the 
caged Gowachin. 

“A sun confines enormous ener- 
gies, Pcharky. Are your energies 
inadequate?” 

But Pcharky’s attention was on 
McKie. The old voice croaked. 

“Human, tell me: Did you come 
here willingly?” 

82 



“Don’t answer him,” Jedrik 
snapped. 

Pcharky closed his eyes. Inter- 
view ended. 

Jedrik, accepting this, whirled 
and strode to the left around the 
cage. 

‘ ‘Come along, McKie. ’ ’ She didn’t 
look back, but continued speak- 
ing. “Does it interest you that 
Pcharky designed his own cage?” 

“He designed it? Is it a prison?” 

“Yes.” 

“If he designed it. .how does it 
hold him?” 

“He knew he’d have to serve my 
purposes were he to remain alive.” 

She had come to another door 
which opened onto a narrow stair- 
way. It climbed to the left around 
the cage room. They emerged into a 
long hallway lined with narrow 
doors dimly lighted by tiny over- 
head bulbs. Jedrik opened one of 
these doors and led the way into a 
carpeted room about four meters 
wide and six long. Dark wood 
panels reached from floor to waist 
level, shelves loaded with books 
above. McKie peered closely: books 
. .actual paper books. He tried to 
recall where he’d ever before seen 
such a collection of primitive. 
But, of course, these were not 
primitive. These were one of 
Dosadi’s strange recapitulations. 

Jedrik had removed her wig, 
stopped midway in the room to turn 
and face McKie. 

“This is my room. Toilet there.” 
She pointed to an opening between 
shelves. “That window. .” 
Again, she pointed, this time to an 
opening opposite the toilet door. 
“. .is one-way to admit light and 
it’s our best. As Dosadi measures 



GALAXY 



such things, this is a relatively se- 
cure place.” 

He swept his gaze around the 
room. 

Her room? 

McKie was struck by the amount 
of living space, a mark of power on 
Dosadi. .the absence of people in 
the hall. By the standards of this 
planet, JedrUc’s room, this building, 
represented a citadel of power. 

Jedrik spoke, an odd note of 
nervousness in voice and manner. 

“Until recently, I also had other 
quarters — a prestigious apartment on 
the slopes of the Council Hills. I 
was considered a climber with ex- 
cellent prospects, my own skitter 
and driver. I had access to all but 
the highest codes in the master 
banks, and that’s a powerful tool 
for those who can use it. Now. .” 
She gestured. “. .this is what I 
have chosen. I must eat swill with 
the lowest. No males of rank will 
pay the slightest attention to me. 
Broey thinks I’m cowering some- 
where, a pallet in the Warrens. But 
1 have this. .” Again, that sweep- 
ing gesture. “. .and this.” One 
finger tapped her head. ‘‘I need 
nothing more to bring those Council 
Hills crashing down.” 

She stared into McKie’s eyes. 

He found himself believing her. 

She was not through speaking. 

“You’re definitely male Human, 
McKie.” 

He didn’t know what to make of 
that, but her air of braggadocio 
fascinated him. 

“How did you lose that 
other . .” 

“1 didn’t lose it. I threw it away. 
1 no longer needed it. I’ve made 
things move faster than our precious 



Elector, or even your people, can 
anticipate. Broey thinks to wait for 
an opening against me?” She shook 
her head. 

Captivated, McKie watched her 
cross to the window, open a 
ventilator above it. She kicked a 
wooden knob below the adjoining 
bookshelves, pulled out a section of 
panelling which trailed a double 
bed. Standing across the bed from 
McKie, she began to undress. She 
dropped the wig to the floor, 
slipped off the coveralls, peeled the 
bulging inner disguise from her 
flesh. Her skin was pale cream. 

“McKie, I am your teacher.” 

He remained silent. She was 
long-waisted, slim and graceful. 
The creamy skin was marked by 
two faint scars to the left of the 
pubic wedge. 

“Take off your clothes,” she 
said. 

He swallowed. 

She shook her head. 

“McKie, McKie, to survive here 
you must become Dosadi. You 
don’t have much time. Get your 
clothes off.” 

Not knowing what to expect, 
McKie obeyed. 

She watched him carefully. 

“Your skin is lighter than 1 
expected where the sun has not 
darkened you. We will bleach the 
skin of your face and hands 
tomorrow.” 

McKie looked at his hands, at the 
sharp line where his cuffs had pro- 
tected his arms. Dark skin. He re- 
called Bahrank talking of dark skin 
and a place called Pylash Gate. To 
mask the unusual shyness he felt, 
he looked at Jedrik, asked about 
Pylash Gate. 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



83 



“So Bahrank mentioned that? 
Well, it was a stupid mistake. The 
Rim sent in shock troops and 
foolish orders were given for the 
gate’s defenses. Only one troop 
survived there, all dark skinned like 
you. The suspicion of treachery was 
natural.” 

“Oh.” 

He found his attention compelled 
toward the bed. A dark maroon 
spread covered it. 

Jedrik approached him around the 
foot of the bed. She stopped less 
than a handswidth away from 
him . creamy flesh, full breasts. 
He looked up into her eyes. She 
stood half a head over him, an 
expression of cold amusement on 
her face. 

McKie found the musky smell of 
her erotically stimulating. She 
looked down, saw this, laughed and 
abruptly hurled him onto the bed. 
She landed with him and her body 
was all over him, hot and hard and 
demanding. 

It was the strangest sexual exper- 
ience of McKie’s life. Not love- 
making, but violent attack. She 
groaned, bit at him, clawed. And 
when he tried to caress her, she be- 
came even more violent, frenzied. 
Through it all, she was oddly 
careful of his pleasure, watching his 
reactions, reading him. When it was 
over, he lay back, spent. Jedrik sat 
up on the edge of the bed. The 
blankets were a twisted mess. She. 
grabbed a blanket, threw it across 
the room, stood up, whirled back to 
look down at him. 

“You are very sly and tricky, 
McKie.” 

He drew in a trembling breath, 
remained silent. 



“You tried to catch me with 
softness,’’ she accused. “Better 
than you have tried that with me. It 
will not work.” 

McKie marshalled the energy to 
sit up and restore some order to the 
bed. His shoulder pained him where 
she’d scratched. He felt the ache of 
a bite on his neck. He crawled into 
the bed, pulled the blankets up to 
his chin. She was a madwoman, 
absolutely mad. Insane. 

Presently, Jedrik stopped looking 
at him. She recovered the blanket 
from across the room, spread it on 
the bed, joined him. He was acutely 
conscious of her staring at him with 
an openly puzzled frown. 

“Tell me about the relationships 
between men and women on your 
worlds.” 

He recounted a few of the love 
stories he knew, fighting all the 
while to stay awake. It was difficult 
to stifle the gaping yawns. She kept 
punching his shoulder. 

“I don’t believe it. You’re 
making this up.” 

“No ... no. It’s true.” 

“You have women of your own 
there?” 

“Women of my . Well, it’s 
not like that, not owner- 
ship . ahhh, not possession.” 

“What about children?” 

“What about them?” 

“How ’re they treated, educat- 
ed?” 

He sighed, sketched in some 
details from his own childhood. 

After a while she let him go to 
sleep. He awakened several times 
during the night, conscious of the 
strange room and bed, of Jedrik 
breathing softly beside him. Once, 
he thought he felt her shoulders

shaking with repressed sobs. 

Shortly before dawn there was a 
scream in the next block, a 
terrifying sound of agony loud 
enough to waken all but the most 
hardened or the most fatigued. 
McKie, awake and thinking, felt 
Jedrik’s breathing change. He lay 
tense and watchful, awaiting a 
repetition or another sound which 
might explain that eerie scream. A 
threatening silence gripped the 
night. McKie built an image in his 
mind of what could be happening in 
the buildings around them: some 
people starting from sleep not 
knowing (perhaps not caring) what 
had awakened them; lighter sleepers 
grumbling and sinking back into 
restless slumber. 

Finally, Mckie sat up, peered into 
the room’s shadows. His disquiet 
communicated itself to Jedrik. She 
rolled over, looked up at him in the 
pale dawn light now creeping into 
the shadows. 

“There are many noises in the 
Warrens that you learn to ignore.’’ 
Coming from her, it was almost 
conciliatory, almost a gesture of 
apology, of friendship. 

“Someone screamed,” he said. 

“I knew it must be something 
like that.” 

“How can you sleep through 
such a sound?” 

“I didn’t.” 

“But how can you ignore it?” 
“The sounds you ignore are those 
which aren’t immediately 
threatening to you . those which 
you can do nothing about.” 
“Someone was hurt.” 

“Very likely. But you must not 
burden your soul with things you 
cannot change.” 



“Don’t you want to 
change . that?” 

“I am changing it.” 

Her tone, her attitude were those 
of a lecturer in a schoolroom and 
now there was no doubt that she 
was being deliberately helpful. 
Well, she’d said she was his 
teacher. And he must become 
completely Dosadi to survive. 
“How’re you changing things?” 
“You’re not capable of 
understanding yet. 1 want you to 
take it one step at a time, one 
lesson at a time.” 

He couldn’t help asking himself 
then: 

What does she want from me 
now? 

He hoped it was not more sex. 
“Today,” she said, “I want you 
to meet the parents of three children 
who work in our cell.”

— The Dosadi Lesson: 
A Gowachin Assessment 



Aritch studied Ceylang carefully 
in the soft light of his green-walled 
relaxation room. She had come 
down immediately after the evening 
meal, responsive to his summons. 
They both knew the reason for that 
summons: to discuss the most recent 



DOSADI EXPERIMENT

report concerning McKie’s behavior 
on Dosadi. 

The old Gowachin waited for 
Ceylang to seat herself, observing 
how she pulled the red robe neatly 
about her lower extremities. Her 
features appeared composed, the 
fighting mandibles relaxed in their 
folds. She seemed altogether a fi- 
gure of secure competence, a 
Wreave of the ruling classes 
. not that Wreaves recognized 
such classes. It disturbed Aritch that 
Wreaves tested for survival only 
through a complex understanding of 
sentient behavior, rigid performance 
standards based on ancient ritual 
whose actual origins could only be 
guessed; there was no written re- 
cord. 

But that’s why we chose her. 

Aritch grunted, then: 

“What can you say about the re- 
port?” 

“McKie learns rapidly.” 

Her spoken Galach had a faint 
sibilance. 

Aritch nodded. 

“I would say rather that he 
adapts rapidly. It’s why we chose 
him.” 

“I’ve heard you say he’s more 
Gowachin than the Gowachin.” 

“I expect him soon to be more 
Dosadi than the Dosadi.” 

“If he survives.” 

“There’s that, yes. Do you still 
hate him?” 

“I have never hated him. You do 
not understand the spectrum of 
Wreave emotions.” 

“Enlighten me.” 

“He has violated my essential 
pride of self. This requires a 
specific reaction in kind. Hate 
would only dull my abilities.” 



“But 7 was the one who gave 
you the orders which had to be 
countermanded.” 

“My oath of service to the 
Gowachin contains a specific in- 
junction, that I cannot hold anyone 
of my teachers responsible for either 
understanding or obeying the 
Wreave protocols of courtesy. It is 
the same injunction which frees us 
to serve McKie’s Bureau.” 

“You do not consider McKie one 
of your teachers?” 

She studied him for a moment, 
then: 

“Not only do I exclude him, but 
I know him to be one who has 
learned much about our protocols.” 
Aritch studied her. 

“What if I were to say he is one 
of your teachers?” 

Again, she stared at him. 

“I would revise my estimations 
of him . and of you.” 

Aritch took a deep breath. 

“Yet, you must learn McKie as 
though you lived in his skin. 
Otherwise, you will fail us.” 

“I will not fail you. I know the 
reasons you chose me. Even McKie 
will know in time. He dares not 
spill my blood in the courtarena or 
even subject me to public shame. 
Were he to do either of these 
things, half the Wreave universe 
would go hunting him with death in 
their mandibles.” 

Aritch shook his head slowly 
from side to side. 

“Ceylang! Didn’t you hear him 
warn you that you must shed your 
Wreave skin?” 

She was a long time responding 
and he noted the subtle charac- 
teristics which he’d been told were 
the Wreave adjustments to anger — a

twitching of the jowls, tension in 
the pedal bifurcations . 

Presently, she said: 

“Tell me what that means. 
Teacher.” 

“You will be charged with per- 
forming under Gowachin Law, per- 
forming as though you were another 
McKie. He adapts! Haven’t you ob- 
served this? He is capable of defeat- 
ing you . and us in such a way, 
in such a way that your Wreave 
universe would shower him with 
adulation for his victory. That can- 
not be permitted. Too much is at 
stake.” 

Ceylang trembled and showed 
other signs of distress. 

“But I am Wreave!” 

“If it comes to the Courtarena, 
you no longer can be Wreave.” 

She inhaled several shallow 
breaths, composed herself. 



“If I become too much McKie 
aren’t you afraid I might hesitate to 
slay him?” 

“McKie would not hesitate.” 

She considered this. 

“Then there’s only one reason 
you chose me for this task.” 

He waited for her to say it. 

“Because we Wreaves are the 
best in the universe at learning the 
behavior of others — both overt and 
covert.” 

“And you dare not rely on any 
supposed inhibitions he may or may 
not have!” 

After a long pause, she said; 

“You are a better teacher than 
I’d suspected. Perhaps you’re even 
better than you suspected.”

MJW CALIFORNIA DISCOVER 
Europe? Will fusion power be used 
in the Light Water Reactor fission 
system? Whatever happened to 
super-heavy elements? 

I know, I know. Last month I 
promised a column on how to be- 
come a space colonist. That column 
will be duly written, but we inter- 
rupt the regularly scheduled pro- 
gram for a special bulletin — mostly 
because I forgot to look at my 
calendar before I wrote last month’s 
column. 

You see, every year the Council 
for the Advancement of Science 
Writing puts on a week-long series 
of briefings. This year’s was differ- 
ent in that the National Association 
of Science Writers received a 
generous grant from the Upjohn 
Company to let them bring in writ- 
ers who might not otherwise attend, 
and the NASW for unfathomable 
reasons thought it would be a Good 



Thing to have me come down and 
deliver my thoughts on creative 
techniques in science writing. 1 
doubt my contribution to the pro- 
gram was of much use; certainly 1 
learned more from my colleagues 
than I gave them. But the bottom 
line is that for a week I was in Gal- 
veston, Texas, in company with the 
top science writers of the US listen- 
ing to a series of background brief- 
ings on subjects ranging from Dr. 
Jonas Salk on influenza vaccination 
to Berkeley’s Albert Ghiorso on 
super-heavy elements. Thus I didn’t 
have time to do the research for the 
scheduled column. 

Besides, what’s the hurry? Jimmy 
Carter’s very first act was to rework 
the upcoming federal budget to 
stretch out the Shuttle program for 
at least two more years before first 
flight, so it will be at least that 
much longer before they’ll be need- 
ing American space colonists.

Until very recently we thought 
we understood the genesis of man: 
African origin, long period of 
evolution from ape to proto-man to 
Neanderthal Man; then, about 
32,000 years ago Cro-Magnan Man 
appeared in Europe, quickly displac- 
ing his Neanderthal cousins. Cro- 
Magnan or modem man then spread 
across the globe, and simulta- 
neously differentiated into races. 
Some 11,000 years ago mongoloid 
hunters crossed the land bridge from 
Asia to North America, and 500 
years ago came the Europeans and 
Africans; and here we are. 

It may not be that way at all. 

Dr. C. Ranier Berger, Professor 
of Anthropology, Geography, and 
Geophysics at UCLA, reports recent 
archeological finds that cast doubt 
on the Cro-Magnan aspects of this 
sequence, while Dr. George Todaro, 
who holds the unlikely (for making 
anthropological discoveries) position 
of (2hief of the Laboratory of Viral 
Carcinogenesis, National Cancer In- 
stitute, has evidence that mankind 
evolved first in Asia, not Africa. 
All rather disturbing, and if any of 
my readers are looking for a field in 
which to make really startling con- 
tributions, I suggest a career in an- 
thropology. The whole subject is 
due for a radical and fundamental 
restructuring. We really don’t know 
very much about man’s pre-history. 

First, let’s look at Dr. Berger and 
the North American Indians. You 



can pick up mammoth bones all 
over Southern California, some of 
them 50,000 years old and more, 
and anthropologists have often sus- 
pected that a few of these mammoth 
bones are from beasts that died vio- 
lent deaths at the hands of persons 
unknown; but until recently there 
was no real evidence of this. 

Out on Santa Rosa Island, a pri- 
vately owned ranch that was once 
connected to the mainland, one 
finds both mammoth bones and 
what can only be hearths. The 
bones are burnt, and were fairly ob- 
viously cooked for someone’s din- 
ner. Recent finds make that virtu- 
ally certain — and radiocarbon dating 
shows that both bones and hearths 
are more than 40,000 years old. 
The people associated with them are 
mongoloid and thus definitely mod- 
em man. So it spears the earliest 
evidence of what we call Cro- 
Magnon Man is now found, of all 
places, in California, leading natu- 
rally to the question, did the New 
World populate the Old? 

Alas, though, that’s not certain. 
What we have are some undatable 
chunks of human bone which seem 
to be of the same strata and age as 
the cooked mammoths; stone tools 
and cooking hearths definitely more 
than 40,(X)0 years old, but not the 
two together — yet. It would be very 
nice indeed if we could find their 
burial grounds; some remains of 
those Paleolithic hunters who slew 
wooly mammoths on Santa Rosa Is- 
land 40,(KX) years ago. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



89 



All right: modem man was in the 
New World well before we thought 
he ought to be. So what? Well, the 
problem is, how did he get here? 
The Asian land bridge across the 
Bering Straits opens and closes 
periodically with the advance and 
retreat of the glaciers during Ice 
Ages, and is the only really credible 
route, unless you credit the Eskimo 
with a far older culture and water- 
faring technology than anyone ever 
has dreamed of. Which of those 
temporary periods brought men 
from Asia to North America? There 
have never been any Neanderthal 
remains found over here. None at 
all. And at the moment the oldest 
remains of Modem Man we know 
of seem to be associated with 
California. Very interesting. 

Now back to viral cancer and 
human evolution. Pick one: vimses 
cause cancer; are caused by cancer, 
prevent cancer. Indeed, each of 
those statements is tme under cer- 
tain circumstances, and actually it’s 
more confusing than that: certain 
vimses certainly cause cancers, but 
those same infectious vimses are ac- 
tually generated, created, by 
healthy animals who are themselves 
more or less immune to that kind of 
viral cancer. The theory is that 
these animals have evolved the 
cancer- vims-creating mechanism as 
protection — a kind of self- 
vaccination process. That kind of 
evolution takes a long time. 

The worst offender is the ba- 
boon, some species of which con- 

90 



stantly contaminate their environ- 
ment with cancer vims. Fairly ob- 
viously any animal susceptible to 
that form of viral cancer has great 
incentive to evolve protective 
mechanisms; certainly a species 
that’s immune to baboon viral 
cancer has a better chance of survi- 
val. 

Now of the Great Apes, the 
gorilla and chimpanzee are the 
most closely related to man. This is 
not in dispute on scientific grounds 
except as part of a general attack on 
the whole evolutionary hypothesis 
mounted mostly by religious au- 
thorities. (The Catholic and most 
Orthodox churches have long ago 
come to accommodation with evolu- 
tion but many Protestant sects con- 
tinue to oppose the theory — and 
some of their spokesmen have ex- 
cellent scientific credentials; no, I 
don’t care to get into that discussion 
here.) If, though, you accept that 
man, the gorilla, and the chimpan- 
zee all had a common ancestor, as 
most evolutionary theorists do, the 
viral evidence becomes important: 
because the chimps and gorillas, 
alone of the Great Apes, have 
evolved defenses against African 
baboon viral cancer. Neither man, 
nor the gibbons, nor the orang- 
utans have done so. 

Baboon virus is infectious to 
man. New World monkeys, and 
Asian apes. Incidentally, the com- 
mon house cat has also come to 
terms with baboon virus, but not 
totally, arguing that the cats reached 



GALAXY 



Africa well before man, but not as 
long ago as gorillas and chimpan- 
zees. 

Dr. Todaro’s conclusion is that 
somewhere after man, the gorilla, 
and the chimpanzee differ- 
entiated — say 12 million years ago 
—gorilla and chimpanzee ances- 
tors made their way to Africa and 
stayed there. Man did not, but must 
have spent nearly the whole of the 
Pliocene Era, all that time until 
perhaps a million years ago, in 
Asia. The data, he says, “suggest 
that. .the older Australopithecines 
found in Africa, though clearly 
hominids, were probably, therefore, 
not in the main lineage to man, but 
rather, unsuccessful offshoots whose 
progeny have not endured to the 
present.” (Beneviste and Todaro, 
“Evolution of type C viral genes,” 
Nature Vol. 267.' 101, 13 May 
1976.) 

Which brings us back to my ear- 
lier statement, that if you’re looking 
for a field that needs some really 
new contributions, anthropology is 
ready for a new genius. 

★ ★ ★ 

So much for anthropology; now 
for something practical like energy. 
There were two speakers. Dr. 
Robert Thresher of Oregon State 
University who is part of an ERDA 
project on wind energy, and Dr. 
Moshe Lubin of the University of 
Rochester on fusion. 

There’s not much new data on 



wind — or far too much: that is, 
there is no startling new informa- 
tion, only a very great number of 
studies and experiments designed to 
inch our way forward to a time 
when wind might provide as much 
as 5% of our national electric 
power, and while 5% is respectable 
and very much worth worWng on, 
it’s not going to change the world. 

The largest windmill ever built 
was a 1.25 megaWatt machine on 
Grandapa’s Knob in Vermont. It 
was called the Smith-Putnam 
machine, it worked in the 40’ s, and 
it was a failure: it couldn’t compete 
economically with coal, and eventu- 
ally suffered a catastrophic accident. 
(Windpower experts study “loss of 
blade accidents” the same way that 
nuclear engineers study loss of 
coolant accidents in fission plants.) 

There was once a 200 kiloWatt 
machine working on the city island 
of Gentzer in Denmark; at present 
that mill is tethered, but the Danes 
are thinking of refurbishing it. 
What’s important are the numbers: a 
modern electric plant generates 
something like 1000 megaWatts; the 
biggest windmill ever made was 
1.25 megaWatts; and ERDA’s big 
new experimental windmill, the 
Mod Zero constructed near Cleve- 
land to study stresses and strains of 
putting all that much metal up in 
the sky, is a 100 kiloWatt device. It 
takes a lot of windmills to make 
significant amounts of power, which 
isn’t to say that windmills won’t be 
useful, particularly in remote windy

places far from other fuel sources. 

Fusion, on the other hand, is 
generating a bit more excitement. 
You’ll recall from previous columns 
that fusion has had its ups and 
downs: a few years ago, everyone 
thought it was the new hope of the 
future. Last year at the AAAS meet- 
ing you could cut the gloom with a 
knife. The present mood, according 
to Dr. Lubin (whose work at 
Rochester is in Laser fusion) is one 
of controlled optimism. 

First, nobody has changed their 
mind: fusion will not produce direct 
on-line power in significant amounts 
before the years 2010 to 2020, 
exactly as I’ve reported previously. 

Secondly, the national energy plan 
still calls for about 50% of US 
baseload electric power to come 
from nuclear fission by 1990; and 
thirdly, present uranium reserves 
cannot sustain nuclear fission power 
at that rate of consumption for more 
than forty years. 

That’s the energy dilemma: we 
need nuclear power. If you think 
strip mines are bad now, wait until 
1995 without nuclear, when there 
will be enormous freight trains run- 
ning about the country carrying noth- 
ing but coal; coal-slurry pipelines 
will cross the deserts and rivers and 
wild places; black-lung compensa- 
tion payments will be in the tens of 
billions of dollars a year. The pre- 
cipitated flyash and other waste 
products will accumulate in billions 
of tons, and must be disposed of 
somehow, and even then millions of 



tons of pollutants will get into the 
atmosphere even with the best 
cleanup technology. We need nu- 
clear power, which is to say fission 
power (the only kind we’ve got) to 
get to the end of the century: but 
the nuclear power fuels can’t last 
very long after that. 

Two ways to go. One is to make 
more nuclear fuel, which is to say 
breeders. I used to be a big en- 
thusiast for the fast breeder, and 
I’m still willing to argue the case 
for them; after all, breeder technol- 
ogy, which we invented, is now in 
use in England, France, and the 
Soviet Union although we’ve yet to 
build a commercial demonstration 
plant. However, the breeder has its 
problems. Plutonium is nasty stuff. 
The nuclear fuel cycle has vulnera- 
ble points in it, times when ter- 
rorists might be able to get their 
hands on weapons-grade plutonium, 
or at least manage to get something 
that could be chemically refined 
into a weapon. Nobody, deep down 
in his heart, loves plutonium (but 
nobody really loves blacklung and 
other coal side effects either, even 
though we put up with them). 

What would be really marvelous 
would be a system that lets us in- 
vest in conventional Light Water 
Reactors (LWR’s), a proven 
technology that we’ve got on the 
shelf, and operate them without 
nuclear fuel reprocessing. It turns 
out there may be two ways to do 
this. 

One is the “slow breeder”: 



92 



GALAXY 



Thorium, a relatively plentiful ele- 
ment, can be bred into U-233, 
which can then fuel conventional 
reactors. That’s relatively expensive 
power compared to burning natural 
uranium, but it has the advantage of 
being a nearly eternal source of 
energy. Alas, it also requires a new 
technology, including mining and 
refining techniques, and it doesn’t 
do anything with the truly mon- 
strous amounts of uranium we’ve al- 
ready mined. 

There is enough U-238 around in 
mine tailings, stockpiles, etc., to 
last the world at least a thousand 
years. U-238 won’t fission, though, 
and has to be bombarded with neu- 
trons to turn it into plutonium — and 
we’ve already discussed that. No- 
body wants all that plutonium. 

But suppose we could make the 
plutonium safe? Paradoxically, the 
best way to do that might be to 
make it more dangerous. That is, 
nobody in his right mind is going to 
try to steal spent fuel elements. 
“Used” fuel rods contain not only 
long-lived plutonium, but also vari- 
ous fission products, which are 
short-lived and thus very radioac- 
tive. You don’t want to get close to 
them, and if you have the technol- 
ogy to work with things like that, 
you don’t need to steal your fission- 
ables: it takes something with the 
resources of a wealthy govenunent 
to be able to make useful weapons 
out of spent fuel rods. The danger- 
ous part of the nuclear fuel cycle 
comes when the plutonium has been 



extracted and is lying about by it- 
self; that can be handled with only 
moderate care. 

So now comes the point. Fusion 
power systems produce neutrons. 
(For a lot more on this subject, see 
this column, “Fusion Without Ex- 
lax,” Galaxy October 1976.) When 
neutrons interact with U-238, they 
turn it into plutonium which can be 
used to power an ordinary LWR. 
Suppose we took spent fuel ele- 
ments, left them in the sealed rods, 
and inserted them into a “recharg- 
ing” system? Can we do that? 

According to Dr. loibin, we can. 

The current status of fusion re- 
search is summarized in Table One. 
You can see there are some prob- 
lems, but we’re moving toward get- 
ting useful power from fusion de- 
vices. However, as we pointed out 
here back in the October column, 
once you have achieved fusion you 
still do not have a useful power 
plant. What you’ve got is a lot of 
fast neutrons; they still must be 
caught and their energy extracted. 
You’ve still got to build turbines 
and generators or a big MHD 
(magneto-hydro-dynamics and don’t 
worry about it) tunnel, or some 
other very massive and very costly 
system for taking neutron energy 
and turning it into electricity. That 
can be a very large problem, al- 
though it hasn’t been emphasized 
much by fusion enthusiasts. 

But — fusion makes neutrons. 
Neutrons are what’s needed to “re- 
charge” spent fuel elements. Spent

fuel elements, whether “recharged” 
or not, are so dangerous that they’re 
safe: that is, they can be shipped 
about in huge containers stressed to 
withstand hundreds of g’s, and no- 
body is going to open one of those 
things. With “recharging” there is 
never a point in the fuel cycle 
where weapons-grade material ex- 
ists; the Pu concentration in a “re- 
charged” fuel element will be 
around 5% of the oxide (while 
weapons-grade is about 90% en- 
riched metallic) so that even if a 



demented terrorist group stole the 
fuel elements they’d be useless. 
(Oh, sure, they’d be dangerous, but 
so would the equivalent weight of 
TNT or plastique.) 

At any rate, the concept is fas- 
cinating, and provides one bit of 
evidence for my basic thesis: that 
we are not doomed, the Club of 
Rome is wrong, and mankind has a 
very good chance at “Survival With 
Style.”

Now, in keeping with the title of 
this column, let’s get far out. 

In Blish’s classic “Cities in 
Space’’ series one basic element 
was “anti-agathic” drugs: a phar- 
macology that cures death by re- 
versing the effects of aging. Now in 
principle such things are surely pos- 
sible: certainly it must be possible 
to take a human being at some ar- 
bitrary stage of development and 
stimulate continuous regeneration so 
the system never “wears out.” “In 
principle” is not practice, though; 
nobody knows how to do this. 

However, Dr. Allan Goldstein of 
the University of Texas Medical 
Branch, Galveston, may well have 
taken several giant steps down that 
road. Dr. Goldstein, with Dr. Abra- 
ham White at Albert Einstein 
University, some years ago began 
work on immunological deficiencies 
in humans. All our textbooks tell us 
that the thymus gland, that lump on 
the breastbone, has largely degener- 
ated by about age 40 to 50. The 
older textbooks say the function of 
the gland is unknown; bolder spirits 
even asserted that it was useless, 
something like a vermiform appen- 
dix. That turns out not to be the 
case. 

Human beings have two periods 
of severe danger: in childhood, be- 
fore the immune system develops; 
and in old age, when the immune 
system deteriorates. In both those 
times we are vulnerable to various 
cancers, infectious diseases, and 
auto-immune disorders. Next, let us

plot the levels of thymosin in the 
blood at various ages. (Thymosin is 
one of the secretions of the thymus 
gland.) 

The results are interesting: as the 
thymus gland vanishes (until at age 
40 only about 10% remains, and at 
age 80 it is virtually gone), the 
thymosin level falls, and our sus- 
ceptibility to diseases associated 
with aging — the very ones that were 
so dangerous to us in childhood be- 
fore the immune system 
developed — mounts rapidly. 

Dr. Goldstein has used thymosin 
to treat children with immune- 
system deficiencies. The results 
have been dramatic. Not many 
studies have been done: although 
several children were selected for 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

this treatment, most died before the 
FDA gave permission for this very 
new drug to be used in humans. 

The obvious next step is to try 
thymosin in persons age 40 and 
above, bringing the level up to what 
it was when they were 20 or so. 
That may take a while; it is esti- 
mated that it would cost $30 million 
in studies to get aspirin approved by 
the FDA today, even given what we 
already know about it; I wouldn’t 
care to estimate what the costs of 
getting thymosin approved might 
be. 

However, Dr. Goldstein has 
pretty well proved that the thymus 
gland is the “master gland’’ of the 
immune system, and that treatments 
with thymosin have been very use- 
ful for very young children with 
immunity disorders; that thymosin 
stimulates the development of cer- 
tain cells, called “T-cells,’’ which 
control phagocyte (white blood cell) 
cancer control activity. T-cells 
somehow detect cancerous muta- 
tions and secrete a substance that 
brings phagocytes to the area; the 
phagocytes then proceed to eat up 
the cancer cells before they can 
multiply. Dr. Goldstein is emphatic 
in stating that thymosin is not the 
“magic bullet’’ for curing old 
age — but he strongly suspects that it 
can be useful in letting one age 
gracefully, without many of the 
pains and ailments so common in 
those over sixty. 

He’s also rather excited about all 
the developments in biochemistry 

96 



and immunology. We are on the 
threshold of a new era in medicine. 
Understanding the immune systems 
will of course make transplant 
technology much more reliable; may 
provide the key to cancer, and al- 
most certainly will help keep pa- 
tients alive long enough for other 
cancer treatments to be effective; 
and may well be the means for all 
of us to stay alive gracefully at least 
to the biblical three score and ten. 

I have always had the view (not 
original with me) that the human 
organism is designed to self-destruct 
shortly after age 40. In a tribal so- 
ciety people ought to have the good 
grace to die when their children 
reach child-bearing age — with a few 
hanging around to be tribal elders, 
but most getting out of the way. 
Primitive communities that don’t 
have lots of old people have more 
food for young ones — and their 
tribes increase. 

But modem technology changes 
this. New technology may find a 
way to overcome the self-destruct 
mechanism; and I find it no surprise 
to discover that our immunological 
master gland quietly vanishes about 
the time we’re forty years old. 

I wonder if the FDA will ever let 
physicians give thymosin (which is 
already used in treatment of cancer 
patients and young children) to 
normal people of middle age? I sus- 
pect I could find a number of volun- 
teers. 

Stepping a bit further out, alas, 
we take a step backward. According 



GALAXY 



to Dr. Albert Ghiorso of Lawrence 
Bericeley Laboratories, we have not 
found element 126 and the “magic 
island of stability.” Pity. 

Dr. Ghiorso is probably the dis- 
coverer of element 104. I say prob- 
ably, because the Russians like to 
claim they found it first. (I haven’t 
space to review all the evidence.) 
The upshot is that an international 
committee has been appointed, three 
Soviets, three Americans, and three 
neutrals. The committee has never 
met, but it is supposed to decide 
who, the Americans or the Soviets, 
get to name 104. 

Meanwhile, Ghiorso has reviewed 
the evidence of the Florida 
State — Oak Ridge National 

Laboratory collaboration of Cahill 
and Gentry which had hoped to find 
element 126 in primordial samples 
(the Soviets were searching for it in 
very old stained-glass window 
leads) and found it wanting. Work- 
ing from the other direction — if you 
can’t find it in nature, can you 
make it? — Lawrence Laboratories 
and the Soviets at Dubna have been 
bombarding ^^^Curiumss with 
^*Calcium 2 o in an attempt to create 
super-heavies — and found none. 

It’s a great pity because I’ve just 
finished a science fiction novel 
whose plot depends on the discov- 
ery of super-heavies; but all is not 
lost. It’s true that we haven’t found 
any natural super-heavy elements, 
and best efforts haven’t made any, 
but the search is still on and they’re 
still theoretically possible. 



Finally: what makes the Sun 
shine? It does, you know. Some 
theorists now wish it didn’t. (Sure: 
that would kill us all, but doggone 
it, it sure wrecks a lot of good 
theories. .) 

Open any astrophysics or inter- 
mediate astronomy textbook, and 
you’ll see confidently asserted a 
series of equations showing where 
the Sun gets its energy. Take four 
protons (hydrogen nuclei) plus two 
positrons plus two neutrinos. Add- 
ing the mass/energies of the input 
protons and subtracting out the 
masses of the output discloses some 
mass missing: enough to generate 
25 million electron Volts, and thus 
the Sun shines. 

So, a number of years ago, 
theoretical astrophysicists devised 
an experiment which would confirm 
this so generally accepted theory. It 
wasn’t supposed to be an exciting 
experiment; after all, we know more 
about the Sun than any other star. 
Indeed, most of our astrophysics 
theories are deduced from stellar 
observations, most of which are of 
our own Sun. Besides, it always 
helps to have confirming experi- 
ments of basic theory: Hans Bethe 
settled it all theoretically back in 
1939, but it couldn’t hurt to do an 
actual experiment even if this was 
the best understood aspect of as- 
trophysics. 

So out in the old Homestake 
mine was installed 100,000 gallons 
of perchloroethylene, C 2 CI 4 , and a 
very elaborate system for counting 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

what happened when neutrinos 
struck the chlorine. (That generates 
argon and so gives us a method for 
counting neutrinos.) 

The ^’'Chlorine to ®^Argon reac- 
tion expected from solar neutrinos 
was worked out by Dr. John 
Bahcall, Professor of Natural Sci- 
ences, Institute for Advanced Study, 
about fifteen years ago. The unit is 
the “SNU” (pronounced “snoo”), 
about 10'®* captures per target atom 
per second; not very many, meaning 
that one needs a lot of *^C1 and a 
long time before you expect to see 
anything happen. 

Raymond Davis and John Evans 
of Brookhaven National Laboratory 
worked out the actual test equip- 
ment, which involves finding 15 
Argon atoms per month in that im- 
mense tank of cleaning fluid. They 
have also tested the procedure, in- 
jecting known numbers of Argon 
atoms into the system and recover- 
ing them. To the best of everyone’s 
knowledge that experiment ought to 
work, and the neutrino capture rate 
in the tank ought to be about 6 
SNU. 

The observed result: a maximum 
of 1.3 SNU, and possibly none at 
alL This is astounding. Has the Sun 
gone out? 

Dr. Bahcall is a careful man. He 
wanted it clearly understood that he 
still believes the textbook proton- 
alpha reaction is the explanation for 
why the Sun shines. However, 
when pressed, he will discuss what 
he calls “cocktail party” theories: 



that is, theories that a scientist 
might put forth in a cocktail party, 
but which one has no business pub- 
lishing in a serious journal. 

“Unfortunately,” Dr. Bahcall 
told us, “a lot of cocktail party 
theories have been published. .” 

There are three major classes of 
theories to explain why we have ob- 
served no solar neutrinos: those 
which horrify astronomers, those 
which horrify physicists, and those 
which drive both up the wall. 

The astronomers like to think 
something happens to the neutrinos 
on the way here: they’re produced 
all right, but they’re a lot less stable 
than physicists thought they were. 
After all, the only observations of 
neutrinos have been in paths from a 
few centimeters to a kilometer or so 
long; perhaps over longer distances 
they decay into something else. 
Most physicists don’t care much for 
that theory. 

Physicists, meanwhile, have al- 
ways felt that astronomers don’t re- 
ally understand stars as well as they 
think they do. Thus, Dr. Bahcall 
says, the failure of the standard 
theory just proves to physicists that 
they’re right in being skeptical 
about what astronomers say. (Not 
that Bahcall himself has this at- 
titude, but it is widespread.) 

Anyway, die result has been what 
Bahcall describes as a theoretical 
orgy of mostly “cocktail party” 
theories. 

Item; the Sun has “gone out” 
and periodically does so, reigniting 



98 



GALAXY 



after a period of gravitational 
collapse. Item: there’s a black hole 
consisting of around 1% of the 
Sun’s mass dead center in our star, 
the Sun shines because matter fall- 
ing into the hole gives off energy. 
There’s no fusion in there at all. 
Item (a theory that really drives as- 
tronomers nuts): suppose all the 
heavy elements in the Sun are con- 
centrated in the outer layers (for 
reasons no one can give); then the 
results would be consistent with 
neutrino observation. 

Whatever the explanation, there’s 
probably a Nobel Prize in it, which 
may explain why the Soviets are 
spending enormous sums, really a 
lot of money, on solar neutrino ex- 
periments. They’re scaling up the 
Davis experiment by a factor of 10 
in a tunnel under a mountain (these 
things need to he down deep to 
keep the cosmic ray counts low 
enough so that the solar neutrinos 
won’t be hidden in a fog of interac- 
tions). 

There’s one final possibility, 
strange, but not out of sight: 
that the Sun operates, not on the 
4P 4a -I- 2e^ -l-2vc + 25 meV 
reaction I described earlier, but 
through the PeP reaction: a proton 
plus an electron plus another proton 
yields deuterium (heavy hydrogen) 
plus one neutrino, ie., 

P -t- e' -t- P ^ *Di -f Ve, 
which as you can see produces just 
half the number of neutrinos (and 
they’re at a lower energy level too), 
so that the expected SNU should be 



about 0.3 — and that’s just consistent 
with the observed data. (NOTE: 
there’s no proof that we have found 
any solar neutrinos; but the likely 
level is in the order of 1 SNU.) 

Now the astronomers will not like 
it if the Sun turns out to run on 
PeP; but their unhappiness is as noth- 
ing compared to what will result 
if experiment shows no solar neu- 
trinos at all. Lower than 0.3 SNU 
requires something really far-out, 
strange, new, different, a theoretical 
restructuring along the lines of Ein- 
stein’s work. 

All of which proves that we don’t 
understand our universe quite as 
well as some of us think we do, and 
that shouldn’t be any surprise to 
Galaxy readers. Stand by. In an- 
thropology; immunology; even ag- 
riculture and plant chemistry which 
1 didn’t get to; energy technology; 
and astrophysics, all kinds of excit- 
ing things are happening. Like it or 
not, the Age of Marvels is not over 
by a long shot, and I confidently 
expect to find that about half the 
things I think I know will be obso- 
lete in five years. We don’t even 
know for sure what makes the Sun 
shine! 

Meanwhile, Jimmy Carter’s first 
budget action was to delay the Shut- 
tle. I wonder what will happen to 
the Large Space Telescope? 

It all seems symbolic, somehow, 
and a bit depressing; but at least 
there’s no urgency now about my 
column on how to be a space col- 
onist. ★

We must learn to 
love our enemies. 



There was in- here, and out-there. 
In-here was warm and safe — 
smelly, yes; damp, yes; but safe. 
Out-there . he’d spent half his 
life out-there. He could describe it 
easily, but he didn’t want to open 
his eyes. As long as they stayed 
shut, in-here was cut off from out- 
there, and the pictures — 

-Lieutenant, snap out of it, sir.- 
— the pictures were out-there, 
waiting for him to relax his guard 
and let his eyelids part. As soon as 
that happened, they would re- 
appear, and . and one picture 
would shrink him in stature and 
significance until even he could 
neither see nor feel himself. The 
last time, he’d resisted it with all 
his strength, but no matter how 
firmly he had said that he did have 
meaning, and that he’d proved it by 
gallantry under fire in a dozen en- 
counters with the enemy, it had 
squeezed him down to a pinprick of 
light that sparkled like a star seen 
through atmosphere. If the picture 
hadn’t faded away, it would eventu- 
ally have extinguished that light, 
and he would have been no more. 
But that wasn’t all: there was one 
that made him feel dirty, and dirt- 
ier, and dirtier still, and he was 



well on his way towards becoming 
the foulest thing in the universe, 
unquestionably deserving of eradica- 
tion . and the other, the one that 
had forced him back, step by step, 
until his soul was bared and it could 
break off bits of it and grind them 
with teeth that — 

-Lieutenant, sir, you’ve got to 
come out of it.- 

-He can’t hear you, Sarge.- 

“ You ’re wrong,” he wanted to 
say, but caution kept him silent. 
Outgoing sound waves would link 
in-here and out-there just as surely 
as incoming light waves would. He 
couldn’t bear to offer the pictures a 
bridge to cross, even if it meant that 
he could not respond to the voices. 
They were different from the pic- 
tures. The pictures had been 
. bad. They’d hurt him, and 
... he whimpered as a memory 
reared up menacingly. The voices, 
though, seemed to be on his side. 
They were angry at the pictures, 
probably because of what they’d 
done to him. Keeping his eyes 
squeezed tight, he listened to the 
murmurs at the back of his mind, 
to find out if they were still dis- 
cussing him. They were, so he 
eased towards them, ready to scuttle 
back to safety if he needed to. 

-Why? There’s work to be done, 
repairs to be made, and if he stays 
slumped in his chair like that, we’re 
all in trouble. - 

-He’s in shock, Sarge.- This one 
was gentler, more flexible, but 
metallic nonetheless. -Concussion, 
radiation overdose, TP attack — he’s 
a sick lad.- 

-But I have to be fixed! I can’t 
get us home unless he makes the 
repairs. And he’s got to start now. 



A MEETING OF AUNDS

because my life-support systems are 
shot to hell.- 

-He’s in no shape to do it, Sarge. 
He must recover, first. - 

-How long will that take, Doc?- 

-Who knows?- Its shrug was an 
impression rather than an occur- 
ence. -A week, two weeks, maybe 
longer. 1 haven’t had the opportun- 
ity to examine him thoroughly yet. 
The initial prognosis should be 
ready tomorrow. - 

-Doc- desperation lurked behind 
the voice -a week I can’t wait. The 
converter’s gone. There’s an 80- 
hour supply of air in the tanks. Two 
weeks worth of food, maybe a little 
more water. But even if those 
hadn’t been damaged, most of my 
reaction mass is gone. What the hell 
doldo?- 

-Find a planet with breathable air. 
We’ll let him recover there. Then 
he can fix you.- 

-Yeah.- Its tone was glum. -You 
know. Doc, this gives the mission a 
royal fuckover.- 

-I know. But for now, find the 
planet. We’ll worry about the mis- 
sion later. - 

The voices didn’t fall silent, 
exactly, but they did stop making 
words. A hum hovered l^hind his 
mind, reassuring him that he was 
not alone, urging him to relax, tell- 
ing him that when there were ideas 
to be expressed, the potential would 
be activated. He didn’t care. The 
words had been confusing anyway. 
The hum was nicer: it solaced, hut 
it didn’t bewilder. 

He felt his body drift against the 
left side of his shell, and interpreted 
the sensation as motion. He was 
being sent somewhere — or taken 
somewhere. It didn’t matter. The 



important thing was to keep his 
eyes shut so the pictures couldn’t 
return. Even the fingers peeling off 
his shell didn’t matter. Nor did the 
sudden numb warmth of a sub- 
cutaneous spray. What mattered was 
the cotton wool that was starting to 
fill the void between in-here and out- 
there — good cotton wool, nice cot- 
ton wool, protective cotton . 

★ ★ ★ 

. where was it going? He dug 
his fingers in it to hold it in place 
but it melted like cloudstuff and 
drifted away. With growing anxiety, 
he searched for a more solid patch 
in which to hide. There didn’t seem 
to be any. The hum at the base of 
his skull no longer reassured him, 
not when he was in the midst of 
losing his armor. Settling for rela- 
tive opacity, he curled himself in- 
side a large fluff, all the while curs- 
ing its flimsiness. 

— physically healed and 
adapted,- said the voice. -He can 
breathe the air, drink the water, eat 
the plants and animals — he’ll get 
along quite well.- 

-Was it really necessary to do all 
that to him, Doc?- 

-In my considered medical opin- 
ion,- said the first, somewhat huff- 
ily, -the Lieutenant’s psychic con- 
valescence will extend to a 
minimum eight weeks, and an inde- 
terminate maximum. As we cannot 
provide him with his own food or 
water, and as we cannot convert the 
native food or water, I could see no 
option but to adapt his biochemistry 
to this planet. And given that neces- 
sity it would have been silly not to 
adapt his physique as well.- 



102 



GALAXY 



-Enough bullshit. Doc. I get your 
point. But Base won’t be h^appy if 
we don’t return the same clean-cut 
warrior they sent out. Can you 
switch him back?- 
-Easily.- 

-Is he going to remember his 
stuff, once he’s recovered?- 
-I’m not certain. His knowledge 
was so extensive that some could 
well have been lost. Re-education 
might be necessary. - 
-Shit. That warship’s still up 
there. Doc, looking for us. It’s only 
a matter of time. When it gets in 
range. I’ll show up on its screens 
like a neon sign. You’ve got to get 
the Lieutenant’s mind healed damn 
quick. - 

-I’ll do what I can, Sarge, you 
know that — ah, he’s conscious. 
Good morning, sir — have a nice 
rest?- 

He shivered, less from the cold 
than from the attention. He didn’t 
want to be noticed. That could tell 
the pictures where he was. His 
eyelids screwed themselves together 
and colored lights exploded behind 
them. 

-Sir, everything’s fine, you’re 
safe. You can talk to us.- 
His tongue licked over dry lips. 
The air smelled strange. It wasn’t 
pure, it felt full of different ... he 
sniffed, and caught a whiff of vege- 
tation, and another of fur, and 
another ... it felt full of living 
things, that was the difference, liv- 
ing things and sunlight and fresh 
water. Sounds assailed his ears: the 
wind rustled, paws padded across a 
mud flat, branches creaked, birds 
called. His shoulders slumped as he 
realized that the bridge had been 
laid down; the pictures could cross 



it at any time. Self-restraint was 
now self-defeating. “Wa-water,” 
he croaked. 

-Outside, sir. There’s a stream.- 
-Doc, you can’t send him out- 
side, not in that state.- 
-We can’t transport the water for 
him, Sarge. Once he starts his re- 
covery, he can devise a pump, and 
integrate it with your life support 
systems, but for now ... he must 
do it on his own.- 

-But there were wild beasts out 

there, they could 

-Don’t worry. Your lasers will 
protect him, for one thing. For 
another, he can carry a hand laser. 
And for a third ... as soon as he 
steps outside. I’ll implement a TP 
net that will saturate the immediate 
vicinity.- 

-What the hell good will that do?- 
-Those ‘beasts’ out there are de- 
cision makers, so we’ll be able to 
read them. If any intend to attack 
the Lieutenant, we’ll know at the 
same moment they do. With that 
much advance warning, he’ll be 
safe.- 

-Yeah, well ... I don’t like it.- 
-No other option, Sarge. Besides, 
he has to go out for food, anyway.- 
-My lasers can kill enough in a 
minute to feed him for a year.- 
-Of course. But can you retrieve 
it? Or store it once it’s been re- 
trieved?- 
-Um . no.- 

-All right. So be quiet for a 
while, and don’t distract us. 
Lieutenant, it’s time to open your 
eyes.- 

He shook his head and, for em- 
phasis, laid his palms over his eyes. 
“N-no,” he gasped, “not that. 
Please?’’ 



A MEETING OF AUNDS 



103 



-You have to, sir. Come on, take 
your hands down — that’s a good 
Lieutenant — now open your eyes — 
lots of beautiful things to see — 
that’s it, relax those muscles, let 
them slide apart, easy now, let’s 
go — good!- 

A spear of light flew through his 
slitted eyelids, and tore into the soft 
flesh behind them. “Oh!” He fell to 
his knees, and brought his hands up 
again. “Hurts — enough — no more.” 
-You’ll get used to it, sir, it’ll 
only take a minute. Here, Sarge’ll 
turn down the lights — Sarge? — 
you’ll be okay. Lieutenant, just 
remove — ah, good.- 
The light had softened and no 
longer stung. He moved his head to 
the right, then to the left, back and 
forth, sweeping wider and wider 
each time, until he knew that no 
enemies had infiltrated the place of 
metal and glass. He sagged, and let 
his buttocks rest on his ankles. 
“Wa-water,” he repeated. 

-Yes, sir. It’s outside.- The light 
was growing stronger while it 
spoke. -Go to the door, sir, and 
step out, and I’ll direct you. It’s not 
far, sir.- 
-Doci- 

-Yes, Sarge?- 

-What about germs? Primitive 

places like this have 

-Do you suppose I wouldn’t have 
dealt with that while I was working 
on him? He is immune. - 

-Unh.- It was a grumble of con- 
cession. -Aren’t you at least going 
to give him some clothes?- 

-Why? It’s warm outside. He 
doesn’t need them. And he doesn’t 
remember how to control himself 
anyway — he’d spend half his time 
washing them.- 



-Hmm.- 

He found himself in the lock. 
Dim memories kept him patient 
while he waited for the doors to 
shuffle through their alternation. His 
tongue seemed thicker, seemed to 
fill his mouth and press annoyingly 
against his throat. Then the outer 
door slid back and bright green light 
made him squint. The ramp carried 
him gently to the ground as a 
chorus of high, soft voices 
awakened in his mind. 

-Sir?- Low, but very loud. -Can 
you hear me, sir?- 

“Yes,” he muttered. “Water?” 

-Straight ahead, sir. About two 
hundred paces. - 

Grasses brushed his legs as he 
strode through the field. A line of 
trees ahead indicated the nearer 
bank of the stream. Insects danced 
around him, landing on his shoul- 
ders, crawling on his chest. He ig- 
nored them all, except for the few 
that wriggled into the comers of his 
eyes. 

Another murmur arose and he 
identified it as the sound of water 
slipping over stones. He walked fas- 
ter, broke into a trot, and then into 
a full run. The ground dropped 
away beneath his feet and he tum- 
bled head over heels down the 
slope. A warm backwater broke his 
fall, a thousand slivers of silver 
bursting away from him. He drank. 

-He could have killed himself, 
Doc.- 

-What the hell, Sarge, I can’t 
control him! I can only talk to hitn.- 

-Well, you could have 

-Drop it, Sarge.- 

-Yes, sirl- 

He raised his head and let the 
water trickling from his hair caress

his skin. The sunshine was a com- 
fort, even if it did ricochet off the 
tiny wind waves and make him 
blink. Knees nesting in the soft 
riverbed, he listened to the animals 
that were staring at him.

-Doc, we’re running out of time. 
Not only is that warship still out 
there, another’s on the way. Say 
what you want about the enemy, 
they’re persistent bastards. With 
two of them searching, it won’t be 
much longer before they hit this 
place. When the hell is that kid 
going to be able to fix me? It’s his 
own life that’s at stake.- 
-Is it really that urgent, Sarge?- 
-Yeah, it is. We got maybe a 
month.- 

-Well . .- Reluctance permeated 
its tone. -His physical recovery has 
been complete, but mentally ... he 
has not made sufficient progress, 
Sarge.- 

-Sufficient for what?- 
-For resumption of his duties. I 
shall have to use the hypno-educator 
on him, but . .- it gave an elec- 
tronic sigh -that could further dis- 
orient his personality. - 
-Will it make him remember how 
to repair me?- 
-Oh, yes.- 

-Then do it, dammit, and worry 
about his personality later.- 
Another sigh. -Very well.- The 
volume increased as it pulsed its 
message into the TP net: -Lieuten- 
ant, come here, sir. Lieutenant, 
come here.- 

He was tempted to ignore the 
call, because he didn’t want to re- 
turn to the place of steel and glass. 




A MEETING OF MINDS 



the place where the pictures had had 
their way with him. But the voice 
surged through his mind like a wind 
through tree leaves, and he knew 
that it wouldn’t stop until he’d pre- 
sented himself. 

Bushes shook as he stepped back 
into the clearing. The spindly- 
legged creatures he’d been watching 
sprang high and low in the opposite 
direction, blue tails flicking a star- 
tled farewell. He waited until the 
last had disappeared; their beauty 
and grace laid a weight on his heart. 

Then he was running, because the 
voice was becoming more insistent. 
The smooth slick soil of the game 
trail slipped by under his toes. His 
bare legs, brown now from the days 
he’d spent drowsing on the sun- 
caressed creek bank, pumped easily, 
powerfully. They pushed and 
stretched and pulled; he jumped 
higher over fallen branches than he 
needed to, simply to revel in the 
pleasure of it. 

The days before were cloudy in 
his mind. Every time he tried to 
reach them, he split in two, and 
each half struggled with the other. 
He couldn’t go back in time much 
at all; he had to be content with the 
wispy scraps that floated through 
the elastic barrier. 

He knew that his body had once 
been different — smaller, for one 
thing, and not nearly so strong. 
Now it was long and rangy; he 
could see muscles ripple under skin 
that used to be tighter, firmer, more 
densely packed. 

He liked the new body, with its 
lungs that drew such large volumes 
of the clean light air so happily, 
with the powerful fingers that could 
grasp one tree branch after another. 



higher and higher, until the trunk 
swayed beneath his weight and he 
could lean fa-a-ar out and nearly 
touch the ground. 

It was a goody body, and most 
enjoyably so in die legs that could 
run quickly, effortlessly, continu- 
ously . for hours and hours, 
across all kinds of ground he could 
follow the skitterish, heart-thumping 
beasts of the field ... or flee from 
the soft-footed blood lust of the 
forest’s predators. 

Birds squawked their annoyance 
as he darted across the long grass of 
the clearing; they flurried away 
from their meals to study him from 
the treetops. 

-Come in. Lieutenant.- His image 
shuddered as the, gleaming door re- 
tracted. He ventured into the cube 
of cold light, felt it scrub his skin 
until it seemed that he, too, must be 
burnished smooth. To enter the 
place of glass and steel, one almost 
had to become a part of it. -Thank 
you, sir — please come in.- 
He stood by the door, reluctant to 
advance because the sleek black 
lines of the chair dominated the 
room, and it was in that chair 
that — The air was crisp, and dry, 
and dead. Enveloping him, it tow- 
eled him down, dried his tongue, 
put a feathery tickle at the base of 
his nose. “What do you want?” 

-To your right, sir.- 
A glossy plastic panel rose to ex- 
pose an alcove; his eyes narrowed 
at the sight. Faint memories stirred, 
but they were only bulges in a cur- 
tain. 

-Please go irt there, sir.- 
“I don’t want to.” 

-It won’t hurt, sir, really .- 
He caught the edges of words not 



106 



GALAXY 



meant for him: -Dammit, Doc, can’t 
you make him get in there?- 

-Impossible, Sarge. He is our 
CO, remember?- 

-Yeah, but 

-I can’t override my program- 
ming, Sarge, and I doubt if you can 
override yours. He’s boss no matter 
what shape he’s in. We have to 
coax him.- 

The voice was directed at him 
again, its center impacting on his 
face. -Sir, please go in there, we 
really need your help.- 

“If I do, will you let me go out- 
side again?” 

-Of course, sir.- 

“All right.” He stepped inside, 
ducking his head because the ceiling 
was so low. The panel fell like 
soundless night, and sealed itself. 
His skin began to creep. He licked 
his lips. The room was too small, 
too sleek. Its hard surfaces and 
sharp angles were threatening. He 
had to — 

*bleep’'‘ 

-What program are you running, 
Doc?- 

-Emergency Repairs, eventually, 
but I have started with Tool Han- 
dling. - 

-How long will it take?- 

-Two hours and thirty-seven min- 
utes.- 

-And then he’ll fix me?- 

The voice took pains not to mar 
the other’s bright eagerness. -I hope 
so, Sarge, 1 really hope so.- 

* * * 

He put down the welder. ‘‘Run a 
check on that, Sarge.” 



-Yes, sir.- A light glowed on the 
control panel, and something deep 
inside hummed peacefully. -That’s 
it, sir, 100%.- 
‘‘ Anything else?” 

-Not a thing, sir, not a thing. - 
The computer sounded as satisfied 
as a man who leaned back from a 
belt-loosening dinner. -Damn, but 
it’s good to have you back, sir.- 
‘ ‘Thanks.” He wound the cord 
into a tight coil, and stowed it with 
the other equipment in the tool 
chest. ‘‘It’s good to be out of that 
fog I was in.” 

-We’re ready for take-off any 
time, sir.- 

‘‘Oh?” He stretched, and let 
himself bask in the warmth of 
knowing that he’d done a difficult 
job well. Fatigue was settling in, 
slowly overwhelming the now un- 
necessary drive for perfection. 
‘‘Well, just let me out and you can 
go on about your business.” 

-Sir?- It appeared to squelch its 
surprise, and force itself to con- 
template the possibility of unsus- 
pected malfunctions. -I’m not sure I 
heard you correctly, sir.- 

‘‘I said open your door so 1 can 
get out — then go do what you 
want.” 

The voice started to sputter, and 
another cut in smoothly; -Do you 
plan to remain here, sir?- 
‘‘Well, sure. Doc.” He was puz- 
zled by their surprise; it seemed to 
him that they had once been more 
sensitive, less obtuse. Hadn’t he 
made himself clear? They’d asked 
him to fix them. He had, not letting 
his queasiness interfere. Now the 
job was done, and they could leave. 
‘‘You didn’t think I was going to 
go with you, did you?” 



A MEETING OF MINDS 



107 



-Frankly, sir, we had been ex- 
pecting it. Why do you wish to 
stay?- 

Bewildered, he gestured to the 
enclosing walls, the low-hanging 
ceiling. “Can’t you see?” he asked, 
thinking of the forest’s sprawl, with 
its hollows and hills and infinity of 
heights. 

-If it’s claustrophobia, sir, the 
hypno — - 

“No!” He winced as the shiny 
walls spat back his sharpness. He 
hadn’t meant to be abrupt; he’d 
only wanted to express distaste for 
the machine that planted spiked 
seeds in helpless minds. He 
wouldn’t go back into anything that 
opened the top of his skull, and 
toyed with the essence of his being. 
It had already changed him— 
although, luckily, in a good way — 
but he wouldn’t give it a second 
chance. 

He liked himself the way he was: 
free, natural, hone.st. The machines 
wanted to alter him, wanted to turn 
him into something closer to them- 
selves. To create their golem, they 
were as willing to mutilate his soul 
as the enemy was. 

People need room, and variety. 
They need winds that sometimes 
come through a pine forest, and 
sometimes blow straight off an ice- 
strewn sea. They need the billion 
sounds of life, the ever-changing 
textures of nature. They get none of 
those in a metal ball that rolls be- 
tween the stars. 

The machines knew that but they 
didn’t care. Ruthless in their refusal 
of independence, they insisted that a 
human hand hover over their metal 
skins. The hand’s yearning for free- 
dom meant nothing to them. Noise, 

108 



that was all. Run it through the 
modulators a few times, clear away 
the static, beam it where you will. 
If that meant tampering with the 
mind, well . 

With dreadful clarity, he saw 
how his allies mirrored his enemies: 
the one wanted slaves and the other 
wanted masters. Each was willing 
to shave off whatever intricacies, 
eccentricities wouldn’t fit into the 
form. Each hungered for a part of 
man; neither would take him whole 
and complete. 

“Let me out,” he said, fearing 
that if he stayed longer, subtle 
changes would begin to show in 
him, “let me out!” 

-Sir,- argued a voice, he didn't 
care any longer which, -the enemy 
is en route, and if they discover 
you — - 

“Let me out!” He hammered on 
the door. His lungs burned with air 
he wasn’t meant to breathe, air de- 
signed for machines, dry and cool 
and sterile. It would be a vacuum if 
they weren’t such masochists that 
they demanded to be subservient. 
“1 am ordering you to let me out!” 
-Open the door, Sarge.- 

-1 was going to, but 

-You cannot mutiny any more 
than 1 can; you will only destroy 
yourself if you attempt it.- 

-Doc, we have to take off ’cause 
they’re coming and they’ll spot us 
as soon as they scan this side of the 
planet, but Doc, he can’t survive 
here, not out in the woods without 
your TP net and all.- 
-We both know that, but he does 
not. And he is the CO. So just- 
wait. Can we play hide-and-seek 
with them?- 

-You mean keep the planet be- 
GALAXY 



tween us and them? Sure, no 
sweat. - 

-Give the Lieutenant a radio he 
can use to call us. After take-off, 
we will stay in this vicinity as long 
as possible.- 

The voices were cold mists at the 
back of his mind; he couldn’t clear 
them away and they wouldn’t leave. 
His fist was getting sore. His throat 
was raw. “Please,” he gasped, 
“please, open your door.” 

-If you take this radio, sir,- a 
compartment cover flew up and the 
radio glistened in its fluorescent 
lights -we will open the door. Use 
the radio if you want us to return to 
pick you up.- 

He hesitated. It could be a trap, 
a ... a Trojan Horse. Why would 
one machine urge him to take a 
second machine unless the second 
would make him more amenable to 
the demands of the first? But — he 
touched it tentatively, then moved 
his finger away — he could always 
throw it away once he was outside. 
“All right.” Picking it up, he con- 
cealed it in the palm of his hand. It 
lay as cool and silent as a pebble. 

The floor vibrated as the doors 
slid back. He stepped into the air- 
lock, eyes wary for a final attempt 
to detain him. His heart raced for 
the few seconds of solitary con- 
finement. Then honest light 
splashed across his cheeks and real 
air filled his lungs and he was down 
the ramp, running, forgetting the 
micro-transmitter, ignoring the si- 
lent upward thrust of the ship, run- 
ning . free.

bound with slender vines — didn’t 
stop the rain but did slow its head- 
long rush. The fire was going out 
again. He cursed, rummaged in the 
shadows for another length of dry 
wood, but came up empty. With 
another curse, he resigned himself 
to darkness. 

The forest was a different place 
with the TP net gone. Before, hear- 
ing all the animals, he could mea- 
sure their reactions to his smelt. 
He’d had plenty of warning the two 
or three times one had chosen to at- 
tack him. 

Now, without the machines that 
augmented his inherent sensitivity, 
they were only sounds in the night, 
odors on the wind. If one was hun- 
gry, he wouldn’t know it until the 
very last moment. 

Grinning skeletally into the 
forest, he realized that he was 



A MEETING OF MINDS 



109 



afraid. And in that moment he re- 
alized further that he was glad to be 
afraid, because for the first time in 
months his fear was of harm to his 
body. He could die there amid the 
rotting leaves and branches, but 
he’d die with his mind intact. 
Neither tooth nor claw could do 
more than still that mind. And no- 
thing else really mattered. 

The last ember crackled; the last 
tongue of flame spit and died. He’d 
have to wait for morning. He pulled 
deeper into his shelter, club in one 
hand, laser in the other. He re- 
minded himself to be sparing with 
the laser — it would soon exhaust its 
charge. 

His eyelids slipped down; he 
inched cautiously into the hazy mix of 
real and unreal that prefaces the 
truer illusions of sleep. A part of 
him played sentinel, ready to sound 
the alarm at the first carnivorous 
snarl, or even the first brush of fur 
against rain-soaked grasses. 

-Doc, we got real troubles. 
They’re on their way.- 
-So we play hide-and-seek, 
right?- 

-Wrong. Both ships are coming. 
We can dodge one of them easily 
enough, but not two. They’d pick 
up our emissions in a minute. - 
-So what do we do?- 
-We could make a dash for 
home 

-And leave the Lieutenant be- 
hind? Not a chance. - 
-I was afraid you’d say that. Our 
other choice is to set down on that 
moon and shut ourselves off.- 
-But should the Lieutenant call 
us 

-We can leave one low-power re- 
ceiver going; I’ve already written a 

no 



program that will wake us up when 
the Lieutenant’s signal comes in.- 

-Well, if you think — - 

-1 do.- 

-All right.- 

★ ★ ★ 

The uneasiness had been growing 
within him all day; he could no 
longer pretend that it sprang from 
changing atmospheric conditions, or 
from worry about the planet’s pred- 
ators. It was too strong, too famil- 
iar, too . 

... not evil, exactly. Something 
else, a deep and basic difference 
that the human soul could not ac- 
cept, had to reject without being 
able to explain its precise repug- 
nance. The propagandists, who’d 
never felt it for themselves, used 
the word evil all the time, but that 
blurred the fine distinction his mind 
was trying to make. 

Sitting on a sun-warmed rock he 
tried to pin it down. There was 
strength, puipose, and an acute in- 
telligence. But — and this spawned 
the uneasiness — all were different, 
all tangential to their human equiva- 
lents. 

Take their ships. Ungainly arrays 
of girder-laced pods, they were 
sealed units, with neither hatches not 
airlocks evident, as though they had 
been built around their pilots. Their 
armor made them all but invulnera- 
ble to lasers, yet the specialists 
who’d examined several derelicts of 
battle claimed there was no shield- 
ing between the engines and the 
bridge. And why had no one ever 
found a corpse, or even an empty 
spacesuit? 

The whole war had been a suc- 
GALAXY 



cession of such incomprehen- 
sibilities. First contact had com- 
menced with a blast from the alien’s 
lasers, and had ended with the 
evacuation of an entire system. The 
enemy had presented no demands, 
registered no protests. Revealing 
nothing of themselves they’d come 
upon humanity like a plague. Even 
after nine years of frequent skir- 
mishing the only thing known about 
them was that they built fast, tough, 
deadly ships. 

Like most humans, he reacted to 
the enemy as would a mastiff to the 
presence of a tiger: neck hairs bris- 
tling, belly tight, mind awash with 
the perception of the difference. 
The oppressiveness of their proxim- 
ity, like a spectre leaning over his 
shoulder, drove him to his feet. He 
stood uncertainly, his shadow cool 
black against the brown grasses of 
the hillside. 

Hiding would do no good. The 
enemy wasn’t searching for him 
physically — though its detection de- 
vices were superb, even they 
couldn’t single him out from all the 
other mammals — but it didn’t have 
to. Short of leaving the planet, he 
could not escape the pressure of its 
mind. 

Ah! It had noticed him now. 
Rather, it had just realized that it 
had been growing aware of his 
presence. He could feel its thoughts 
shifting, the focus of its attention 
kaleidoscoping until it peered down 
at him like a monstrous eye through 
a microscope lens. 

Leave. The order twisted through 
his brain like a worm through soil; 
its after-texture was of slime. 

He squinted into the dazzle of 
blue that was the sky, as if he 



thought he could spot the extra glint 
that came from its ship. I can’t, he 
said. 

It knew he spoke the truth, be- 
cause otherwise his lasers would 
have been stabbing at it. 

You leave. 

When we perceive the impetus, 
we shall. 

He interrupted quickly, in the 
hope that he could influence it be- 
fore its pride — was that the right 
word? wouldn’t “reflexes” be more 
accurate? — made it impossible for it 
to bypass him. In the interim, then, 
let us tolerate each other. 

Tolerate? 

He felt a spark of hope. In all the 
times he’d seen their tumbling craft 
on his screens, he’d never encoun- 
tered one willing to negotiate. Al- 
ways had the furious beams lanced 
out, as if hurled by an instant, in- 
evitable animosity. Let us not harm 
each other, he explained. 

Certainly. Cease your mental 
processes. 

I cannot. Is there no other way? 

No. You blur the vision. You 
twist definitions. Hatred began to 
writhe in the other’s thoughts. You 
impinge on our perceptions, and 
distort the reality. You must die. 

He knew then that reason was 
futile. Involved was no simple 
xenophobia, nor nationalistic squab- 
bles over spheres of exploitation. 
Madness was the issue. The races 
could not co-exist and retain their 
sanity. It would be like mixing 
steam and ice, and hoping that they 
would remain unchanged. 

But he didn’t want to fight. 
Death was one thing; it could be 
faced with near-equanimity because 
it would have to be experienced 



A MEETING OF MINDS 



111 



eventually. Personality disintegra- 
tion was different. To know that his 
body could live as the setting for a 
charred and tortured fragment of his 
soul was to know horror. 

And it was so damn painful. 

His hands were shaking. Unable 
to control them, he laid them flat on 
his thighs and pressed hard. A 
cloud slipped before the sun; he 
shivered as if it were an omen. 

He was being given no choice: 
the enemy would attack. His only 
alternatives lay within himself. He 
could let it ravage his being, or he 
could resist. If only he were 
stronger. If only he hadn’t lost the 
first engagement so decisively . 

Very well, he said slowly. I see 
that one of us must die. Be warned 
that I intend to survive. The bit of 
bravado was meant for himself, not 
for it. In a TP battle, beliefs, more 
so than actions, can be clung to like 
timbers in a storm-tossed sea. 

The attack began, gently enough, 
when the enemy exchanged its 
photosensitivity for his. Colors 
shifted, with violets fading and new 
reds seeping into the landscape. The 
purpose was disorientation. The ef- 
fect was of a surreal battlefield that 
stubbornly refused to drink the 
blood urged upon it. 

Rejecting the vision, he forced 
the spectrum back to its normal 
range. He sensed its disquiet. As 
his eyes roamed across the opposite 
bank, he intensified every hue. 

It retorted with a figure of a 
man — himself, he knew quickly, 
elicited from his mind by shrewd 
suggestion. The figure stood tall 
and proud. Though puzzled by the 
tactic, he was pleased by his appar- 
ent air of heroism. 



Then changes crept in. The focus 
sharpened to reveal a backdrop of 
stars, tiger eyes peering from im- 
penetrable night. The figure seemed 
smaller, its pose more pompous. 

Harsh, mocking laughter rang 
across the firmament. The. field, en- 
larging, shrank him proportionally. 
Loneliness rode a chill wind from 
space, a wind that whistled through 
his limbs and jeered at his solitude. 

He was alone, the wind told him, 
because his race didn’t want him. 
He had a power that made them 
edgy, a talent that made him pariah. 
They’d exiled him, murmured the 
wind, sent him away so their 
daughters would be safe, so their 
grandchildren would be normal. 
They’d dropped him into the empti- 
ness that swaddled the universe and 
they hoped that he’d never find his 
way home. 

And he, roared the wind’s bitter 
humor, had thought himself 
honored. He had believed he was 
needed. He, like all the other damn 
fools who cruised their chrome 
cages so far from scent and sound 
of their fellows, he had actually pic- 
tured himself as a hero. 

Lies, shrieked the wind, all lies. 

He was sagging, shoulders 
slumped and head hung low. It was 
telling the truth. He was an out- 
cast, he was a leper, he was 
... he was . 

The sun’s wami hand stroked his 
back; the wind’s gentle fingers 
brushed his hair. He shook himself, 
widened his eyes and grasped the 
rock’s gritty sides. 

Pinpricks of pain awakened in his 
palms. He squeezed harder, till the 
blood welled from a source of tiny 
punctures. It gave him something to

hold onto while he cleared his head. 

[ Then he was ready. You’re 
wrong! The image in his mind 
shuddered, split, fell into a heap of 
glittering rubble. That’s your life 
story, not mine. / am loved. To 
I reinforce his certainty, he dipped 
‘ briefly into memory: after his last 
de-briefing, he’d emerged into a 
hall jammed with friends, relatives, 
reporters, anxious well-wishers 
. there were cheers, hands to 
be shaken, microphones at every 
side, nubile young bodies curved 
I against his . I am loved, do you 
hear? Do you feel? It’s you who are 
not! 

He’d show it why. He’d prove it 
to it. His eyes criss-crossed the 
pools of sunlight, reached into the 
rambling shadows. There, on the 
I damp soil by the water — 



— now its ship from afar, zoom 
in on the control pod, peel back the 
armor. Abruptly show the pilot’s 
couch — 

— overflowing with dung and a 
million maggots. 

That sudden Juxtaposition should 
have jarred it, but it seemed 
stronger. It lashed out like a whip; 
he had to jump back. Retreating, he 
remembered the sequence from the 
earlier skirmish, and when the giant 
teeth snapped at him — 

— he decayed them into powder. 
That gave him time to launch a 
new onslaught: the enemy’s own 
people (empty outlines tinted with 
the signal that would trigger it into 
painting them in) drive the enemy 
into its ship, weld tight the last 
plate, send it on a kamikaze mis- 
sion — 



A MEETING OF MINDS 



113 



A mirror. Himself. The flesh of 
his face drooping, dripping, running 
like water from bones that glow — 
— alone in a tangle of machinery 
while a radioactive bulkhead spits — 
— his own hand fading into in- 
visibility — 

— stinking sealed tomb — 

— nothingness — 

— hate — 

His mind shook with the enemy’s 
violent, vehement negation. 

Then — he was too tired, too im- 
potent. His offensives had had no 
effect; his defenses were slipping 
rapidly — then go to them, damn 
you, join them, embrace them. Al- 
most idly, he transmitted the pattern 
of his remembered debriefing, leav- 
ing the details of appearance vague 
so that the alien could populate the 
scene with its own kind. He felt it 
sink in — 

— and was almost immediately 
blown off his rocky stool by a 
tsunami of shock and horror. Rub- 
bing the back of his head, he 
looked up in confusion. After- 
tremors of disgust continued to echo 
dirough the enemy’s mind. 

The setting sun raised bands of 
light sbo\e the horizon, as if they 
could slow its descent. Fur- 
feathered birds kawed past, gorging 
themselves on the insects that 
clouded the air. He watched them 
without seeing, while his mind 
probed the enemy that would shrivel 
it. 

And then he understood. 

After that, it was easy. He bad so 
many memories of togetherness 
... the only difficulty was in de- 
termining which to use. He chose a 
few at random, like an archer reach- 
ing blindly into his quiver, and shot 



them off one after another: affec- 
tionate relatives, passionate girl- 
friends, jubilant teammates . 

The enemy was radiating misery, 
but that wasn’t enough. He needed 
more. 

He looked at his hands, strong 
and capable. They rotated; they 
flexed. He made fists and fans and 
claws, multiplied them by a 
thousand, then by a million. 

All the hands in the universe 
reached for the enemy, straining to 
stroke it, aching to touch it. A 
forest of fingers, all — 

When he regained consciousness, 
his mind was quiet. The enemy was 
gone. 

Stiffly, he began to collect 
firewood. Night would be upon him 
soon, and with it the other pred- 
ators. The pile of kindling grew. 
Bats chittered as they made a feast 
of the insects he had disturbed. A 
weary restlessness turned each dry 
stick into an iron rod. 

At last he could sink dowg 
against the hard ground and let the 
roaring flames bring a flush to his 
face. The possibility that he might 
spend the rest of his life hauling no 
longer excited him and the laser’s 
charge was almost gone, which 
would make hunting even more dif- 
ficult. And the summer was already 
passing, cooling down into autumn. 

He had no business being 
planetside — he was a scoutship 
pilot. The life-choked forests weie 
meant for others, for people who 
needed a comfortable reality tangi- 
bly onmipresent, and in graspable 
sizes. 

But he didn’t. He thrived on 
emptiness, and on distances that ap 
proached infinity. That was his 



114 



GAlAXr 



element, and outside of it he was 
meaningless. 

Like a person watching a silent 
film, he tried to delve into his 
memories and discern the reason 
he’d wanted to leave his ship. What 
he found was one-dimensional, in- 
comprehensible: a running man who 
kept looking over his shoulder even 
though nothing chased him. The 
image elicited no sympathy, no un- 
derstanding of what had driven him. 
The two were completely different 
people. 

He thought he recalled approxi- 
mately where he’d left the micro- 
transmitter. In the morning he’d 
find it. 

★ ♦ ★ 

-Welcome aboard. Lieutenant. - 

“Thanks, Sarge.” He surveyed 
the small room with undisguised 
pleasure. “Are we ready for take- 
off?’’ 

-I would like to run a quick 
MedCheck first, sir,- said the other 
computer. -There are also a few 
physiological alterations that must 
be made to restore you to your orig- 
inal status. - 

“Oh, sure.’’ He crossed to the 
appropriate cubbyhole and waited 
for its panel to retract. “It won’t be 
long, will it?’’ 

-No time at all, sir.- The door 
hissed up, and a light shone invit- 
ingly. -Just step inside, please.- 

The sub-cutaneous spray stung 
his arm like a loving insect, and the 
anesthesia swirled in his veins. The 
world faded into mist, but the 
voices throbbed at the back of his 
head: 

-Your gamble paid off, Doc.- 



-Exactly as I predicted,- it re- 
plied, not a little smugly. 

They went on, but he stopped lis- 
tening. The drugs, by isolating his 
mind from his body, had freed 
something else to bob to the fore- 
front. It was a small notion that, 
having taken root in his subcon- 
scious the previous evening, was 
now beginning to flower in the il- 
lumination of his concentration. 

Remembered love had driven the 
enemy from the battlefield after 
hatred and fury had failed to budge 
it. The other scoutship pilots should 
know about that vulnerability. Base 
should he told at the earliest possi- 
ble opportunity. 

The insight had another facet, 
though, one that might have greater 
significance than its potential for 
destruction: it was a measure of the 
enemy’s alienness, of the great gulf 
that lay between them and humani- 
ty. As such, it could well say some- 
thing about the assumptions of 
mankind. 

If we shun loneliness while they 
flee togetherness, if we prize impor- 
tance while they yearn for insignifi- 
cance, if we pursue life with the 
same persistence that they seek 
death ... if our love is their 
hate . could our war have been 
their play? 

Maybe, he mused, as the 
MediMachine trimmed, transfused, 
and transformed him, we misun- 
derstood them from the beginning. 
Which means that they might have 
misunderstood us. Which means 
. my God, do they think we 
enjoy this? 

It was something he’d have to 
ask the next time he encountered 
the en — the others. ★ 



A MEETING OF MINDS 



115 



A computer’s loyalty Is 
to its programmer. 



Xhe first problem was with United 
Panacea’s version of the Pill. The 
pamphlet that had come with that 
month’s up-dated tapes had called it 
a breakthrough. UP had done away 
with all the old side effects by tak- 
ing a different tack: their drug at- 
tacked the pituitary, the master 
gland of the body. It jiggered the 
controls on the ovaries instead of 
aping their output. It altered hor- 
mone levels at the source. 

Dr. Luther Thistlebank had 
signed hundreds of prescriptions for 
the new drug without question. He 
had smiled and nodded when his 
female patients had thanked him for 
the freedom from headaches and 
swelling and fear of blood clots he 
had given them. He had congratu- 
lated himself on his astuteness when 
they sent their friends to him. And 
he had felt extremely satisfied 
whenever he had checked his bank 
balance. 



There was no doubt about it. This 
Pill was a wonder. 

Many of his Pill patients were 
young. They were healthy, 
smooth-skinned, and siUcen-voiced. 
Young mothers, career women, col- 
lege students. He didn’t see them 
often, but when he did he smiled to 
himself. They were a pleasure to 
examine. 

At least they had been. 

Polly Holmes had been one of his 
favorites, until the day she barged 
past Miss Epsolm into his office. 
He looked up from his desk and felt 
shock. Her face seemed grey, until 
he recognized the graininess of 
stubble. Her arms and legs seemed 
gaunt, until he saw past the loss of 
fat. She might have been exercising 
heavily, but her words belied that 
thought. 

“You bastard!’’ 

His mouth dropped open. Her 
voice was still silk, but there was 
gravel under the sheen. It held 
lumps and runs that he had never 
heard from her before. He stared as 
she leaned over his desk, pretty de- 
spite her rage, despite the words she 
spat at him. Despite the stubble. 

“You son of a bitch! Look what 
you’ve done to me!” She grabbed 
the hem of her skirt with one hand 
and yanked it up to her chin. The 
other hand burrowed under the 
waist of her panties and pulled 
downward. “Look!” 

He gasped. He leaned on his desk 
as he bent toward her to see. “My 
God! Miss Holmes!” Her clitoris 



HELP NOT WANTED 



117 



was three inches long, the prepuce 
fully developed. It hung limply over 
the bulge of her labia. He stretched 
out a hand to investigate it more 
fully, but she suddenly backed 
away, letting her skirt fall back into 
place. 

“It gets in .the way!” she 
screeched. “It gets hard! It sticks 
out! And it turned my boyfriend 
off!” 

Nonplussed, the doctor settled 
limply back into his chair. He 
stared at her furious face. Mas- 
culinized, surely. Whiskers. A 
changing voice. And he was sure 
there was more hair on her muscu- 
lar arms and legs. The Pill must 
have controlled the wrong hor- 
mones. 

He could say nothing, except, 
“Well, have you tried. ?” 

“Bastard!” She grabbed a jar of 
tongue depressors and heaved them 
at him. “That goddam pill’s the 
only pill I take.” Tears appeared in 
her eyes. “You bastard!’’ She 
spun on her heel, nearly tripped, 
and jerked the office door open. But 
before she left, she turned and 
screamed, “I’ll sue!” 

And she was only the first. 

★ ★ ★ 

The second was with UP’s new 
vaccine. The pamphlet had called it 
another breakthrough, a broad- 
spectrum vaccination. One shot 
would immunize a patient against 
almost everything, even many vir- 



uses. It was the answer to a child’s 
prayer, for it did away with all nee- 
dles but one. j 

It simplified things for Dr. j 
Thistlebank, too, but he wasn’t sure , 
he liked it all that much. It cut . 
down the number of trips a patient 
had to make, the number of times 
the patient could be charged, and in 
good conscience the doctor couldn’t 
charge more for this shot than he j 
did for any other. He consoled him- i 
self with the thought that at least he 
was serving humanity. As he was 
supposed to. 

The first hint of the problem ap- 
peared when Mrs. Diane Skelnick 
came to him. Short, buxom, black- 
haired, and anxious, she sat beside 
his desk and said, “Ever since Josie 
became a Jesus freak, and at the 
age of twelve yet. Ever since, 
we’ve lost her. We don’t have a 
daughter anymore.” She stared at 
the light blue computer cabinet, un- 
able to look at the doctor. 

He listened sympathetically. The 
current term was “godhead,” he 
thought. The city park was full of 
them. “She’s tripped right out of 
sight, then?” he asked. 

“Oh, not really,” the mother 
said. “She still lives with us. But ; 
she doesn’t share. She ignores us. 
She spends all her time with those 
people.” 

“There’s nothing you can do?” 

She shook her head. “The police 
can’t even help. They even warned 
us of her rights! And she’s too 
young to throw out of the house. 



118 



GALAXY 



Even if she doesn’t know it, she 
still needs us.” She hesitated. She 
shifted her gaze from the cabinet to 
the floor at her feet. Her hand tight- 
ened on the strap of her handbag. 
“But we thought. ...” 

Dr. Thistlebank murmured softly. 
When she didn’t respond, he added, 
“Yes?” 

“We thought we might try 
again.” She paused once more. 
“Have another baby, I mean.” 

“And?” 

“It’s not working.” She shrugged. 
“I’ve been on the Pill for years, 
even before Josie. And when we 
started her, she came right away, 
the first month. But now it’s been 
four months already, and nothing. 
Nothing.” 

“Well, that’s not unusual, Mrs. 
Skelnick. It can take a year, or 
more sometimes, for all the effects 
of the Pill to wear off.” He opened 
a drawer beside him and rummaged 
for a pamphlet. ‘‘You can read 
about it in this. You’ve nothing to 
worry about. Just keep trying.” 

She protested, but in the end she 
allowed herself to be ushered back 
into the waiting room, the pamphlet 
jutting from her bag. He was sure 
her anxiety was unfounded. She 
would catch in a few months. When 
the door closed behind her, he dis- 
missed her from his thoughts. 

But she returned to his mind 
when four more women made the 
same complaint. They were all try- 
ing to get pregnant, but it wasn’t 
working. He tried to reassure them, 



too, by telling them what he had 
told Mrs. Skelnick, that it took a 
while after going off the Pill, even 
the new one. 

But his line was spoiled when 
one insisted she had never been on 
the Pill. She had just married, and 
she was trying to start a family right 
away. And she still wasn’t getting 
pregnant. 

He had to take her seriously. He 
examined her. He gave her every 
test he knew, and the only clue 
came from the patch test he made 
with her husband’s sperm. She was 
immune to her mate; she could 
never get pregnant by him. 

She took the news calmly 
enough, though it was an obvious 
blow. Dr. Thistlebank offered to 
refer her to another man, one who 
dealt with artificial insemination, 
but she refused. The father of her 
children, she said, would be her 
husband or no one at all. 

But Dr. Thistlebank couldn’t let 
it rest there. He could do her no 
good, but he could look again into 
those other, similar Complaints. He 
was suspicious now. 

He called those patients in again. 
He checked them out too, and he 
found the same result in each. 
Every one of them was immune to 
her husband, and when, on a 
hunch, he gave them patch tests 
with other sperm samples, he found 
they were all immune to men in 
general. 

He didn’t break the news until he 
had had the computer examine their 



HELP NOT WANTED 



119 



records. He set it to look for com- 
mon factors, to pick out only those 
shared by all these patients. And 
there was only one that mattered: 
the vaccine. They had all had it. 

He sat late at his desk that night, 
his head in his hands. The right to 
give birth was holy. It was a large 
part of a GP’s practice to turn the 
body’s mechanisms on and off 
when the patient demanded it. To 
give her the choice that made the 
right meaningful. 

And he had botched it. God alone 
knew how many women he had 
sterilized. He could see the lawsuits 
coming. 

He wasn’t wrong. 

* * ■* 

The third was with the aspirin. 
Or what passed for aspirin in United 
Panacea’s pharmacopeia. They 
didn’t make anything so simple. They 
went to the roots of the problem, as 
usual, and their product, they 
claimed, was better. It eliminated 
pain by blocking the pathways that 
carried it to the brain. It interfered 
with the normal function of certain 
synapses, the nerve-to-nerve junc- 
tions. 

Dr. Thistlebank thought it effec- 
tive when it brought a smile to the 
face of a woman with migraines. 
He even grew enthusiastic when he 
saw it relieve the pain of a man 
with a badly burned arm. And he 
used it freely, as the computer pre- 
scribed it for everything from ar- 



thritis to sprains. It worked beauti 
fully. 

But relatives sued when the bun 
victim wound up in a ward foi 
schizophrenics. 

And the migraine patients staila 
looking for lawyers as soon as thej 
left the offices of their therapist 
and pyschiatrists. 

The news made Dr. Thistlebatl 
moan. It nearly made him cry. Whj 
did they have to blame him? Whl 
made them think it was the pill? A 
fifth of his patients would neej 
treatment anyway, sometime, foi 
something. But why now? He couM 
only hope they had prior histories. 
Only that could let him off ik 
hook. 

His belly ached. But he didn’i 
take a pill. 

★ ★ ★ 

The fourth was a super-antibiotic, 
one that killed all the bacteria in tht 
body, including the intestinal bac- 
teria that manufactured vitamin K 
Vitamin K is essential to the clot 
ting mechanisms, and Dr. Thistle- 
bank’s pneumonia patients turnel 
into hemophiliacs. 

This problem was relativel) 
minor, though. He managed to 
stave off the lawsuits by discovering 
it in time. Vitamin K supplements 
saved his patients. 

The fifth was an allergy shot tk 
desensitized the patient to every 
thing, even bacteria. 

The sixth was.

GALAX1 



The seventh. 

The disasters had come in quick 
succession, and as Dr. Thistlebank 
relived them, his shoulders 
slumped. His voice grew ragged. 
His fists clenched, and at the end, 
he cried, “Why me? Why did I lis- 
ten?” He was well dressed, heavy, 
soft. His watchband was platinum, 
his wedding ring half an ounce of 
yellow gold. He banged his fists to- 
gether, opened one, and began to 
finger the band. 

“You were greedy, Luther,” said 
Alvin Poindexter. The doctor and 
the lawyer had been friends for 
years, but they still seemed an ill- 
matched pair. Fat and thin, hot and 
cold, but the contrasts were only on 
the surface. They were both profes- 
sional men, they were both Lions, 
and they were both hungry. But the 
lawer was a specialist. “It was 
making a millionaire out of you. 
And I’ll bet you never cut your 
fees. It would have covered your 
ass, you know. Made you seem 
more caring, mote helpful.” 

The doctor looked away from his 
friend. No, he hadn’t. It hadn’t 
even occuired to him. Besides, the 
computer lease was expensive, and 
his wife had insisted immediately 
on buying a summer place, and — 

“Your bills weren’t that bad. 
Don’t make excuses for yourself.” 
Poindexter shook his head slowly. 

Dr. Thistlebank shifted in his 
seat. “It wasn’t all me, Al. It 
wasn’t. Everything was fine till the 
merger. It wasn’t till then that the 



computer began prescribing stuff 
from that poison factory.” 

“It won’t wash, Luther. United 
Panacea was a reputable phar- 
maceutical house, at least up to 
when UBM bought it out. Why 
should it change? Why should their 
products suddenly go bad?” 

“They didn’t.” Dr. Thistlebank 
shrugged awkwardly. “But that’s 
when the computer began prescrib- 
ing their products. If there were two 
brands of an antibiotic on the mar- 
ket, it wanted the one from UP, 
every time. I noticed it, but I didn’t 
care. They were all the same. They 
all worked. It was just the new prod- 
ucts that were bad.” 

“But why, Luther?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe UBM has 
enough clout to buy the FDA. 
Maybe their quality control went to 
hell. Maybe they hired an alchemist 
to head up their research division. I 
don’t know.” He glared at the win- 
dow over Poindexter’s head. He 
waved a hand at the cloud of smoke 
from the other’s cigarette. “That’s 
what I want you to find out. Pin it 
on them, somehow. Get me off the 
hook.” 

The snap in his voice didn’t af- 
fect his friend. Poindexter only 
nodded as he shifted his foot from 
his desk to the edge of the waste- 
basket. He stretched. “No sweat, 
Luther.” For the first time that af- 
ternoon, he smiled. “You’ve given 
me enough, I think. I might even be 
able to get everyone off the hook. 
Settle out of court.”

The doctor straightened in his 
chair. The weight seemed to slide 
from his shoulders. But the relief 
warred with his skepticism. His 
friend had a reputation for answers, 
but. ? He opened his mouth. 

Poindexter held up a hand. “No 
more, Luther,” he said. “Come 
back in a couple of days. I do have 
to check a few things out. Make a 
few phone calls. And we’ll see.” 

★ ★ ★ 

Forty-three patients had hired the 
best lawyer they could find to screw 
a hundred million dollars out of Dr. 
Luther Thistlebank. They had 
dropped lawsuits by the ton on him. 
They had sued the computer com- 
pany, the pharmaceutical company, 
and the FDA. The insurance com- 
pany was threatening to revoke his 
malpractice coverage. And the 
newspapers were crucifying him. 

There was no doubt about it. Dr. 
Thistlebank had shafted his patients 
but good. And he knew it, though 
he told himself repeatedly he hadn’t 
really done anything. He just hadn’t 
kept his eyes open. 

The first whisper of trouble had 
been enough to tell him he needed a 
lawyer, but he had delayed. He 
knew he wanted Alvin Poindexter, 
but at first he had felt too uncom- 
fortable to call. Ever since college, 
his friend had needed him. First, as 
roommate, to pay the rent. Later, as 
doctor, for checkups and pills and 
shots, and, once, to get an alcoholic 



wife into shape for a divorce. He 
hadn’t brought himself to admit the 
shoe was now on the other foot 
until the damages crossed the mil- 
lion mark. 

But his friend hadn’t dithered. 
“Oh, Jesus,” he had said. “You’re 
really in it, ain’t you? Well, look. 
I’m flying out of town this af- 
ternoon. A court date I can’t miss. 
But I’ll be back in a week. Can you 
come over Thursday, after lunch? 
You can tell me how it happened 
then.” 

The doctor waited, but not pa- 
tiently. He fretted, he paced, he 
didn’t sl^p. And every new lawsuit 
seemed to give him a new tic. 

The damages hit the hundred mil- 
lion figure on Thursday morning. 

★ * * 

“I’ll teU you how it happened!” 
screamed the doctor. He pouted as 
he slammed his briefcase on the 
desk with a crash. An ashtray, pre- 
cariously balanced on three con- 
tracts, fourteen summonses, and a 
will, fell to the floor. The mound of 
butts and bumt-out kitchen matches 
it had contained fanned across the 
carpet. 

Alvin Poindexter winced. 
Tennis-weathered wrinkles spread 
over his temples. He had kept his 
office at home for years, and 
though his housekeeper might be 
used to this sort of thing, he still 
wasn’t. He never would be. He 
pinched the bridge of his bony nose 



122

and sighed with a tiredness that 
came only partly from his trip. 
“Now, Luther,” he said. “You 
shouldn’t let a little lawsuit. .” 

“Little lawsuit, my ass!” Dr. 
Thistlebank kicked at an outlying 
cigarette butt and dropped his heavy 
body into an easy chair. He gritted 
his teeth and stared past his friend’s 
desk to the window beyond. “It’s 
just the biggest malpractice suit in 
the history of medicine! I’ll tell 
you!” 

Poindexter sighed again. He lit a 
cigarette and brushed a speck of ash 
from the lapel of his dark green 
suit. He raised a sandaled foot to 
the edge of his desk and propped a 
wrist across his knee. “I’d like you 
to, Luther,” he said softly. “I don’t 
know a thing yet. Though I did 
check with UBM and UP while I 
was gone.” 

“What did they tell you?” Dr. 
Thistlebank spoke sharply, suspici- 
ously. 

“Not much. But they did tell me 
to go ahead. To see what I can do. 
They know my reputation.” He 
touched the three contracts that had 
supported his ashtray with the filter 
of his cigarette. The ash crumbled 
and fell. He brushed it negligently 
to one side, adding, “The insurance 
company too.” 

The doctor combed his fingers 
through the blond hair above his 
ears. He licked his thick lips. “The 
bastards set me up!” he muttered. 

“I don’t believe it, Luther. Why 
should they?” 



“Well, it wasn’t my fault.” 

“So tell me whose fault it was. 
Tell me what happened.” The 
lawyer’s stare was intent, profes- 
sional. They were friends, but he 
wouldn’t let that keep him from 
learning all he could. 

“Mmmp.” Dr. Thistlebank 
squirmed. He gritted his teeth again 
and told himself he’d have to see a 
dentist soon. Unless Alvin found 
the answers even sooner. “Yeah. 
Well. It started nearly two years 
ago. .” 

* * * 

It had been a long day. The 
Memorial Day weekend had left 
him a heavy crop of skinned knees 
and sunburns, of poison ivy rashes 
and rusty nail holes. The only bless- 
ing was that the highway accidents 
and heart attacks had happened out 
of state. He wouldn’t have to worry 
about them until they came home. 
For now, they were someone else’s 
headaches. 

Dr. Thistlebank was looking for- 
ward to getting home. His wife 
would pour the sherry when she 
heard his car in the driveway. The 
paper would be waiting. And the 
kids would be haring around with 
their friends for another hour yet. 

Still sitting at his desk, he began 
to remove his white jacket, but 
paused with one sleeve half off. 
Completing the movement, he 
reached for his intercom. “Miss 
Epsolm. Is that all for today?” 



HELP NOT WANTED 



123 



The intercom crackled patiently 
back at him. “There’s one man still 
waiting, Doctor.” 

He grunted silently as he pictured 
his receptionist leaning forward, her 
blouse sagging from her withered 
chest, her eyes shifting from the 
waiting patient to the intercom and 
the snapshot of her sailor nephews 
behind it. “Very well. Send him 
in.” He struggled back into his 
sleeve and reached for a yellow rec- 
ord card. 

The first thing Dr. Thistlebank 
noticed about his visitor was the 
heavy case he swung before him, as 
if to test the air. The second was 
his startling tie, a broad, electric 
blue, pinned with a miniature saber. 
The last was the man himself, a 
slim and brown-haired fellow, dres- 
sed in a light grey suit. His manner 
was stamped by the broad grin of 
his fellowship. 

Dr. Thistlebank pushed the record 
card aside with a feeling of relief. 
No more patients after all, he 
thought. Just a salesman, and 
perhaps some samples, or another 
gadget. 

He stood and held out a hand. 
“What can I do for you?” 

The other’s handshake was vigor- 
ous. “Perhaps nothing. The real 
question is what I can do for you. 
Dr. Thistlebank. How many patients 
did you see today?” 

The doctor raised an eyebrow. 
The question was out of place. The 
answer was no concern of any 
salesman he had ever met before. 



But it was no secret either, 
“Perhaps twenty. Why?” 

“I may be able to double that fi- 
gure for you,” said the salesman. 
“Or more.” He took a chair and 
laid his case across his lap. “My 
name is Greg Mauser. I represent 
Universal Business Machines, and 
I’m selling efficiency.” He paused 
as if waiting for another question, 
but the doctor remained silent. He 
was curious, but he would let the 
spiel develop. “UBM is computers, 
Doctor. One of the biggest com- 
puter manufacturers on Earth. And 
the most innovative. We’re always 
looking for new ways to use out 
machines, and we now have a way 
that is of particular value to you.” 

The line was standard, though the 
product wasn’t. Mauser was selling 
a computerized diagnostic system, 
out of UBM by Harvard Medical 
School. He had a glossy brochure 
which showed a row of patients giv- 
ing pushbutton answers to television 
questions, an office that was as 
much a GP’s as Dr. Thistlebank’s 
own except for the teletypewriter at- 
tached to the desk. The equipmeni 
was precisely racked in a metal 
cabinet. 

The system would interview Dr. 
Thistlebank’s patients, collect theii 
histories, list their symptoms, and 
ask for whatever data it might still 
need. Though the interview was 
usually enough. And then it would 
print out the most probable diag- 
nosis, together with a prescriptior 
for the appropriate treatment, 



124 



GALAXl 



“That’s how confident we are, Doc- 
tor,’’ said Mauser. “All you have 
to do is tear it off and sign it.’’ 

And it could handle up to six pa- 
tients at once. Dr. Thistlebank was 
intrigued. He’d had a course or two 
on computers in medical school. He 
knew that something like this had 
been in the offing for years. And he 
j knew that more patients meant more 
money and a faster turnover meant 
more time for golf. 

Either way he couldn’t lose. 
Could he? 

When Mauser described the data 
base he almost capitulated on the 
spot. Specialists in every field of 
medicine had contributed. Others 
constantly reviewed the literature 
for new diagnostic clues and treat- 
ment methods. UBM itself made 
sure the latest drugs were listed, 
and it exchanged the system’s tapes 
every month for more up-to-date 
ones. But even when he learned that 
repairmen were on call twenty-four 
hours a day and that the rental 
would be covered by just five extra 
patients a day, he hesitated. Wisely, 
he said he would have to think 
about it. Mauser should come back 
in a week. 

“I really don’t know,’’ said the 
doctor. “It sounds fine. It sounds 
great. But how good is it, really? 
And even if it pays for itself, it’s a 
lot of money. And what if it 
doesn’t? What if the patients don’t 
take to it?’’ He shook his head. He 
really had his doubts. 

“They will. Dr. Thistlebank,’’ 



assured Mauser. “They will. This is 
an upper-bracket town, and half 
your patients work with computers 
everyday anyway. They’ll see noth- 
ing new. And you can tell the rest 
the new system gives you more 
time to discuss their cases with 
them. That’s true. It does. It takes 
over all the dreary detail work. It 
makes medicine more interesting. 
And you can use the time you used 
to spend on details to relate to your 
patients. To exercise your bedside 
manner. They’ll love you for it.” 

Dr. Thistlebank shook his head 
again. “I don’t know,” he said. 
“I’ll still have to think about it.” 

By the time he had seen Mauser 
out of the office, his hour was 
gone. His kids would be home. The 
paper would be rumpled from their 
search for the comics. His wife 
would be pissed. But maybe he 
could end that now. 

* ★ * 

Needless to say, he bought the 
system. He started with three of 
the grayish TV screens occupying 
the waiting room wall facing Miss 
Epsolm’s desk. She quickly learned 
enough to show the patients how to 
use the row of pushbuttons mounted 
along the lower edge of the ivory 
frame. The patients soon grew used 
to the new procedure, and the 
younger ones seemed enchanted at 
the very idea of talking to a com- 
puter. 

But Dr. Thistlebank did think of 



HELP NOT WANTED 



125 



himself as a cautious man. He de- 
liberately held to his doubts for 
months, insisted on checking and 
double-checking the computer. He 
refused to trust the machine’s diag- 
noses, would read the lists of 
symptoms and past diseases back to 
his patients to look for errors, 
would ply his stethoscope and 
tongue depressor as he always had, 
and even when the machine seemed 
right, would send out blood and 
urine samples for confirmation. 

He wasn’t really happy that he 
never caught the computer out. An 
interview, it seemed, was usually 
enough. If lab work was needed, 
the machine would say so in its 
printout, and once the results were 
fed back to the program, its diag- 
nosis was all that the doctor could 
have wished. The one time he 
thought the machine was wrong, it 
was his own diagnosis that proved 
faulty. 

Six months after the system was 
installed, he gave up his doubts. He 
had had to begin to trust. His 
checks and double-checks were ac- 
tually slowing him down. He was 
seeing fewer patients instead of 
more, and the system’s rent was 
coming out of his own pocket. 

Two months after that, he or- 
dered the other three patient termi- 
nals. His practice was booming, 
only partly because of the new Pill. 
His bank account was healthy 
again. Other doctors were complain- 
ing because their patients preferred 
the shorter wait he offered them. 



And he had less time for golf than 
ever. He couldn’t turn a patient 
away, could he? 

He couldn’t, and he hadn’t. And 
the disasters had struck, one after 
the other. Now he was faced with 
ruin. His only hope lay with his 
friend, and that hope was fragile. It 
was so fragile, in truth, that it didn’t 
survive the morning of his sec- 
ond visit to his friend’s office. 

The mailman broke it. He deli- 
vered a letter from Dr. Thistle- 
bank’s insurance company. The letter 
told him his malpractice insurance 
was hereby canceled. 

The cancellation would save him 
several thousand dollars a year, but 
it also meant that he would have to I 
close his office. A doctor who has * 
once been sued is ever after a 
target, and he didn’t dare keep his 
seat in the shooting gallery. 

He told Poindexter as much when 
he entered his office. “A penicillin 
reaction,” he said as he despon- 
dently took his chair. “A little thing 
like that, and I’d be bankrupt. I 
might as well cut my throat. What 
else can I do?” 

Poindexter cleared his throat 
softly. He shrugged. ‘T suppose 
they don’t want to get stung next 
time. They know you’re a target, 
too. And there’s not much I can do, 
unless these suits never come to 
court.” 

“There’s not much chance of 
that.” 

“Oh, I don’t know.” Poindexter 
grinned and reached for bis ashtray.

GALAXY 



His desk was clean now, except for 
a legal pad covered with his close 
scribble. The carpet showed no 
trace of the ashes the doctor had 
spilled three days before. “You 
may be off the hook.” 

Dr. Thistlebank made no attempt 
to conceal his startlement. He had 
hoped, but. “What do you 
mean?” 

“Well, for one thing, you’re not 
alone.” The lawyer paused as if for 
effect. Deliberately, he lit a 
cigarette and dragged out the first 
puff. But he returned to his speech 
when the other’s eyes began to nar- 
row. “UBM leased that diagnostic 
system to fifteen other doctors 
around the country, and they all had 
the same problems, Luther. Though 
not with as many people.” He 
didn’t say the others must have been 
more careful. They still hadn’t been 
as careful as the ten thousand others 
the system had been offered to. 
“They brought the total to about 
two hundred lawsuits. 

“But the side effects are their 
own solution.’ When Dr. This- 
tlebank looked blank, he sighed 
and added, “Look, your Pill pa- 
tients are suing you because you 
gave them a sex-change operation 
without their consent, essentially? 
Right?” 

The doctor nodded. 

“And sex-change operations go 
for about twenty grand. I’ve already 
got a clinic in Baltimore lined up to 
use the drug for that purpose. 
They’ll have to do some work to fig- 



ure out the right dosage, to make 
it work every time. After all, you 
only ran into the problem three 
times, out of how many?” 

“About seven hundred. By the 
end.” 

“Less than half a percent. Like I 
said, it needs woric. But it’ll help 
pay for the damage. And so will the 
others. The allergy shot wiped out 
the body’s defenses, which means 
it’s ideal for transplant surgery. The 
painkiller’s not much good for any- 
thing, but I did talk to a psychiatrist 
who thinks if it can make a guy go 
nuts, another version of it might 
make a nut go normal. He’s talking 
to UP now.” Poindexter stabbed the 
air intently with his cigarette as he 
spoke. He leaned over his desk as if 
to say, “You’re the doctor. Why 
didn’t you see this?” 

But Dr. Thistlebank was numb. 
He could only stare. He had ex- 
pected answers, but not ones so 
neat, so pat, so useful. At last, he 
murmured faintly, “But what about 
the vaccine?” 

“You think that’s the worst, do 
you?” He paused only long enough 
for the doctor to nod vaguely. “It 
sterilized your patients, right? Well, 
there’s your birth control. Perma- 
nent birth control. I talked to a fel- 
low at WHO. He said they could 
handle Bfty million bucks worth a 
year. To him, the stuffs a mira- 
cle.” 

Dr. Thistlebank got the pmnt. He 
should have seen it. He might have 
settled the lawsuits early by spotting 



HELP NOT WANTED 



127 



the glorious luck of the side effects. 
He could have become rich by mak- 
ing the right deals. Bought them out 
himself. 

But now it was too late. He 
stared at his knees. Dimly, he 
noticed that his fists were balling 
his trousers. “But ho^v does all this 
solve the problem now?” 

Poindexter snorted in disgust. “I 
worked that out last night. The pa- 
tients’ lawyers will let the insurance 
companies settle out of court. 
They’ll pay a nickel on the dollar, 
but everyone will be better off.” 

“How?” 

“They’ll pay off with UBM 
stock, which they’ll get cheap from 
UBM. And then they’ll buy every 
share they can for themselves. They 
don’t expect to lose a penny in the 
end. That stock’s going to go up 
like a rocket. Your patients will 
wind up with more than they’re 
suing you for. And the insurance 
companies will get all their money 
back and then some.” 

His tone relaxed as he finished. 
He stubbed his cigarette out. “It’s a 
damned good investment now, 
Luther. You should buy all you 
can. I’m going to, the fee from you 
and every penny I can get my hands 
on.” 

Dr. Thistlebank twitched. The 
message of his freedom had reached 
him, but he was still gripped by the 
threat of losing his practice, his in- 
come. He wasn’t very alert. 
“Fee?” he yelped. 

Poindexter stared at him calmly. 



“Sure. You charged me, didn’t 
you?” 

“But that was nickel and dime 
stuff!” The hurt was obvious in his 
voice. “Ten bucks a throw. I 
Not. Not. ...” j 

“Fifty grand is what I figure.” 

“But. .” Dr. Thistlebank 
paled. A narrow line of sweat i 
popped out on his forehead. 

“Look, you charge according to 
the size of your patients’ pockets. 
Well, so do I. No one comes to me 
unless they can afford me. And you 
can, Luther.” 

“But what will I live on when 
my savings are gone? I can’t prac- 
tice!” 

“I think you can. The computer 
system is what got you into trouble. 

It let your greed get out of hand. 
You never had any trouble before. 

If you get rid of it, I think you can 
get your coverage back. Though for 
a higher premium. After all, you’re 
a bigger risk now.” 

Dr. Thistlebank moaned. 

But six weeks later he was still 
practicing. The patients were still 
coming, though they were fewer. 
The waiting room was the same, 
except for the six patches of more 
lightly colored paint along one wall. 
The Epsolm salts still sat behind the 
intercom. 

The big differences were in his 
personal life. The summer place had 
been sold. And his wife had just 
filed for a divorce. 

She felt she would rather be mar- 
ried to Alvin Poindexter. ★

I AM A MEMBER of the OOTNO 
Society. 

In fact, it’s one of the most im- 
portant things I do with my life, a 
holy duty and a constant joy. It’s 
what Tm doing here, right here in 
front of your eyeballs when a part 
of me would much rather be writing 
that next novel. 

The world is full of many people, 
and these may be divided into 



BOOKSHELF 



129 



OOTNO and NOOTNO. You’re 
either one or the other: One Of The 
Nice Ones, or Not One Of The 
Nice Ones (well, there are border- 
line cases, but not nearly as many 
as you’d think). I conceive my duty 
as a member of the OOTNO Soci- 
ety to be to introduce OOTNOs to 
each other whenever feasible. We 
are locked in a titanic struggle for 
the fate of the world with the 
NOOTNOs, and communications 
are essential. Unhappily, we have 
yet to devise a uniform that the 
NOOTNOs can’t copy or 
counterfeit — we lack an Arisian 
Lens — and so we have to rely on 
recommendation. 

The NOOTNOs are pretty well 
organized, my friends — time we got 
it together. 

That’s why I’m here. Books, re- 
cords, any form of art, can also be 
subdivided into OOTNO and 
NOOTNO — or perhaps what I mean 
is that artists can be so classified, 
on the basis of their works. And 
turning folks on to good books and 
good writers is about the most fun 
you can have out of bed. 

So it is my great joy to tell you 
this month about a pack of beagles, 
none of which is a dog (although 
one of them is a wolf). 

★ ★ ★ 

You see, it was an obit in Locus 
that turned me on to Edgar 
Pangborn, one of the greatest 
OOTNO discoveries of my life. 



And that obit was written by Peter 
S. Beagle, and the things he had to 
say about Edgar had OOTNO writ- 
ten all over and through them. 

So I was in Bakka II, the new 
Yonge Street branch of Toronto’s 
Bakka (the best sf store — and 
mail-order service — I know; see 
Dec. 1976 “Bookshelf” for de- 
tails), and I said, “Tell me about 
Peter Beagle,” and they put The 
Last Unicorn and A Fine and Pri- 
vate Place in my hands and said, 
“OOTNO.” 

Many of you may already know 
The Last Unicom — I understand it 
is something of a “cult” book 
among many OOTNOi (so how 
come none of you turned me on?). 
But if you don’t. I’m here to tell 
you that you ought to — it’ll do your 
soul more good than a piping hot 
bath and ice-cold gin. It is the finest 
fantasy I’ve ever read, just plain 
one of the finest books I’ve ever 
read, and it’s almost scary to realize 
that it all came from one human 
heart. There’s magic in that book, 
and I mean that both kinds of liter- 
ally. 

It is the story of the last unicorn 
in all the world, and of her search 
for her vanished brothers and sis- 
ters, and of what befell her on the 
way. It is also the story of her 
companions, simple Molly Grue and 
Schmendrick the Nitwit Magician, 
of the Prince who loved die unicorn 
though he knew her not and the 
King who hated her though he knew 
her, and of the unspeakably terrible 



130 



Red Bull. It is a story of good and 
evil, of courage and fear, of hope 
and despair, and it will exhilarate 
and tear at your heart if you are any 
damn good at all. I don’t say that 
it’s a perfect book (I don’t suppose 
anyone read any book anywhen 
without feeling that he/she could 
have improved it here and there — 
that’s why some of us become writ- 
ers. Poetic justice, eh?) — but I do 
contend that if you finish this book 
and don’t like it, don’t value it, 
then you ain’t OOTNO. 

That’s a pretty heavy statement, 
but I’ll stand by it. 

And, the cover painting by Ger- 
vasio Gallardo is alone worth the 
$1.75 Ballantine is asking for it. 

★ ★ ★ 

Almost as highly recommended is 
A Fine and Private Place. 

Like Unicorn, it is a fantasy. 
And like Unicorn, it is one of those 
“fantasies” that seem truer than 
what we are generally pleased to 
call reality. It’s a love story — but 
not like any love story you ever 
read before. Two of the lovers, for 
instance, Michael and Laura, are 
dead. Another of them is an old 
man named Rebeck, who has lived 
undiscovered in a cemetery for over 
twenty years, talking only with the 
ghosts. Another is an irascible raven 
with a really sarcastic mouth on 
him, and he is surely the greatest 
and most constant lover in the 
book. 



Virtually the entire story takes 
place in the cemetery, and it has 
more life to it than a two-year-old’s 
birthday party. 

It’s not the same kind of book as 
Unicorn, and you may like it less. 
Death and Love is a somewhat 
weightier topic than Love and 
Death, and the overall tone is a hair 
too somber for my taste. But there’s 
humor aplenty, and a full measure 
of joy and hope, and when you 
think about it, the deadliest mistake 
he could have made with a theme 
like this would have been to come 
all over cute and heartwarming. 

Try Unicorn first, by all means. 
But having done so, don’t omit to 
read this one too. Needless advice: 
by the time you finish Unicorn 
you’ll find yourself wanting to read 
anything by Beagle — old shopping 
lists, term papers, notes to the 
milkman (are you out there, Mr. 
Beagle? I’m at R.R. #1, Hampton, 
Nova Scotia BOS ILO) . 

★ ★ ★ 

So Jeanne and I were visited re- 
cently by our friend Susan Ellison, 
who is definitely OOTNO, and 1 
can prove it because when she saw 
Unicorn on my desk (guests get to 
sleep on my desk) her eyes lit up 
and we spent the next hour grinning 
hugely and rapping about it. And a 
week or so after she disappeared 
back into The Smoke To The 
South, Lila the Werewolf appeared 
in my mailbox. 



BOOKSHELF 



131 



And a wondrous strange book it 
is. Here I just said I want to read 
anything by Beagle, and . hoo 
boy. How do I handle this one? 

Lila is one of the most depressing 
stories I have ever read, beginning 
and ending in despair. Its male 
lead, Fairel, is a young man selfish 
and stingy with his caring, who has 
abandoned all hope of joy and takes 
a dim pleasure in picking at the 
scabs that betrayal leaves on his 
soul. His only real gift is accept- 
ance, and so he accepts rather equa- 
bly the discovery that the woman 
who’s been sharing his apartment 
for the last month, Lila, is a 
werewolf. But he accepts only the 
parts that don’t threaten him, and is 
destroyed by this dishonesty. 

It is also one of the most wildly 
hilarious stories I have ever read, 
and I know that sounds 
contradictory — but it’s true. The 
damn thing is just sWe-splitting in 
spots. Yet if it may be said that 
there is such a thing as tears of 
laughter. Beagle’s humor in Lila is 
a laughter of tears. It is of a kind I 
think of as “hip-Jewish” laughter, 
bitter city laughter, a laughter that 
is supposed to dimly cloak the 
agony beneath. On examination I 
find the agony to be self-indulgent, 
self-inflicted and secretly enjoyed. 
Which would be all right if it were 
physically possible to hurt only one- 
self, which it is not. Despair (that 
is, the delusion that responsibility is 
abdicable) is seductive, and Parrel, 
if not Beagle, has seduced 



himself — surely a comic sight. It 
only hurts when you stop laughing. 

And in spite of this, I enjoyed 
Lila. It is exquisitely formed, beauti- 
ful in language and subtle in con- 
struction, and it has some immortal 
lines in it. I particularly liked the 
building superintendent, whose 
“eyes were aJmost purple, and they 
bulged a little, straining out — the 
terrible 'eyes of a herald angel struck 
dumb.’’ 

It’s a fascinating story — it’s just 
that the only slightest note of hope 
in it is when the neighbors chip in 
to pay the super’s fine for shooting 
silver bullets out of an unlicensed 
pistol. I’m deeply grateful to Susan 
for sending it, and terribly con- 
cerned for Peter Beagle. Ballan- 
tine’s newest promo sheet hints at 
an “upcoming major work’’ from 
Beagle. I look forward to it 
eagerly — but also, having read Lila, 
with some trepidation. 

I feel like sending the man a 
get- well card. 

★ ★ ★ 

What 1 didn’t mention about Lila, 
because it didn’t seem to fit any- 
where, was that it is all of 42 (ad- 
mittedly packed) pages long, no 
more than 10,000 words, and that it 
sells for $2.50. 

Huh? 

Well, it’s what you call a chap- 
book. That means “a pamphlet con- 
taining poems, ballads, stories or re- 
ligious tracts,” according to Ameri- 



132 



GALAXY 



can Heritage Dictionary. According 
to me it means “a short story that 
costs more than two Galaxy's.” 
Chapbooks get printed in small edi- 
tions by small publishers, and 
they’re a Very High Status item. 
Capra Press, which printed Lila, 
also has 17 other chapbooks avail- 
able, by heavyweights like Henry 
Miller (On Turning Eighty), Ray 
Bradbury (Zen and the Art of 
Writing — he oughta know), Anais 
Nin, Lawrence Durrell, and others. 
I think you have to show at least a 
B.A. to get one. 

Now, I can see worth in the no- 
tion of chapbooks. Maybe a really 
fine piece of writing shouldn’t have 
to be imbedded in a magazine or 
antho like a diamond in a pizza — 
I’d love to have a chapbook of The 
Man Who Traveled In Elephants. 
And the economics of small- 
publishing are such that, believe 
me, nobody’s getting rich at $2.50 
a hit. 

But there’s a little note in the 
back that says that 75 numbered 
handbound copies were signed by 
the author, and right there you start 
to slip over the line into the-book- 
as-artifact, into the-book-as- 
trading-card; and that’s where I start 
to get itchy, and that’s why 1 started 
this whole chap on rapbooks (keep 
going — pay no attention, you’ll only 
encourage him). Because there are 
two more chapbooks here on this 
month’s review pile, and they dis- 
turb me greatly. 

The Apocalypse Papers and Good 



Taste are the first two volumes of 
Apocalypse Press’s new Science 
Fiction Chapbook series. The 
former is by the Firesign Theatre 
zanies, the latter by Isaac Asimov. 
Let me quickly dispose of their con- 
tent, as stories: Firesigners 

Bergman, Proctor, Ossman and Au- 
stin (say that three times fast with 
marbles in your mouth and you’ll 
never need a dentist again) each 
offer a couple pages of vaguely 
science-fictional gibberish (much 
like this column, come to think) 
than which their dullest album is 
funnier — a total of 13 pages plus in- 
tros and biblio/discography. Dr. Ike 
presents a 31 -page story which is 
contrived (albeit well contrived) and 
cardboard, an overextended anec- 
dote resting entirely on its final 
telegraphed pun — fun, but not 
much. Understand — I love and as- 
siduously collect both The De- 
mented Four and The Prolific 
One — but this is some of their worst 
stuff, flatter’n a two-dollar tire. 

As such, neither is worth the 
space I’ve spent on them already. 
But here’s the meat. Each of these 
chapbooks was printed up in two 
editions of 500 copies apiece, 500 
“signed in the plate’’ and 500 indi- 
vidually autographed: the Regular 
and the Deluxe. Then they bound 
’em by hand with blue twine and 
destroyed the plates. Neither book 
“will ever again appear in print in 
this form,’’ publisher Alan R. 
Bechtold promises. 

Bechtold obviously noticed that 

133 



BOOKSHELF 



rare old copies of Weird Tales 
command incredible prices — not for 
their intrinsic worth, but as rare art- 
ifacts. So he created artificially rare 
artifacts. The lucky first thousand 
get autographed copies for five 
bones apiece (if 1 correctly under- 
stand this press release — the books 
have no price on ’em), and then 
comes Phase Two. Once they sell 
out (if they haven’t already — again, 
this press release is a little vague). 
Apocalypse Press promises to 
undertake a sort of mail-order 
auction service, whereby spec- 
ulators ... I mean, lovers of 
fine fiction can swap back and 
forth, jacking prices sky-high in a 
twinkling — minus a modest ten per- 
cent for Apocalypse as auctioneers. 

I’m glad neither of these pam- 
phlets is much worth the reading: 
suppose they were good . and 
available only to an elite composed 
of rich collectors? 

And the thing that horrifies me 
the most is that the third contribu- 
tion to this capitalistic ripoff venture 
will be by Harlan Ellison! With 
artwork by Ron Cobb! The last two 
people I’d have expected to go 
along with a scheme to artificially 
inflate the value of their work by 
restricting its availability. 

Frankly, fans. I’m aghast: this 
venture sounds NOOTNO to me, 
and I urge you not to support it. In 
fact. I’m not gonna print 
Apocalypse Press’s address. 

★ ★ ★ 



Ah, but here’s another OOTNO 
in the pile. 

Gerry de la Ree was, with his 
wife Helen, responsible for The 
Best of Stephen Fabian (see Nov. 
1976 “Bookshelf’ for the ravel a 
book I greatly liKed. So when I saw 
his name my eyes perked up. Then 
I saw the title. The Book of Virgil 
Finlay, and I knew I was in Fat 
City. 

I’ve seen a lot of collections of 
“SF Pulp Art From The Golden 
Age,’’ and frankly most of ’em 
bore me. There sure were some 
club-handed artists working in them 
days, and if you lack (as I do) the 
nostalgic glow of having grown up 
on them, they seem mostly em- 
barrassing today. 

But Finlay is timeless and eter- 
nal, a genuine genius — and even his 
staunchest fans may not appreciate 
the true extent of his genius until 
diey’ve seen this folio. Because one 
of his most amazing aspects was the 
phenomenal attention he gave to de- 
tail, his exquisitely painstaking 
work with cross-hatching and stip- 
ple, the amazing spectrum he 
wrought of “black and white’’ — all 
of which tend to drop out in pulp- 
paper reproduction. Finlay’s vision 
always came across — but with blur- 
red edges. 

The Book of Virgil Finlay has ex- 
quisite repro, and nearly all its 
plates are original-size (not as hard 
as it sounds: Finlay did his 
magazine illos “same-size,” the 
same size they would appear in 



134 



GALAXY 



print. This is extremely unusual — 
but think how much more detail 
would have been lost if his works 
had had to be shot down in size.). 
The excellent paper stock allows 
you to fully appreciate the insane 
difficulty of stipple work — and the 
incredible subtlety that makes it 
worthwhile. 

(Let me see if I can explain stip- 
ple. You want to indicate the 
shadows on a character’s face, 
okay? You could use the flat of 
your pencil, and lighten up on it 
where you want the shadow lighter. 
Or you could use an air-brush 
where you want it to lighten up. Or 
a dozen other ways. Or, you can 
stipple the way Finlay did. You dip 
the finest pen-point you can find in 
ink, and make a dot — allowing oniy 
the ink to touch paper. Then you 
wipe the point clean, dip it again 
and make another dot. Several 
hundred dots later, you have a 
shadow. You want lighter shadow? 
Maker smaller dots. 

Finlay sometimes did entire 
plates that way, using dots the way 
God uses molecules.) 

Finlay’s genius was best suited to 
occult and fantastic themes, and 
these predominate in this collection. 
Most of the plates originally ran in 
Weird Tales, and the stories they il- 
lumined are identified by title and 
author. They’re arranged in 
chronological order. But let me tell 
you the best part: there’re J20 of 
them! Furthermore the book can be 
had for a mere $4.95. Clearly, this

is the buy of the month. Even bet- 
ter, it may knock some of the ab- 
surdly inflated value offa those rare 
old copies of Weird Tales . 

Finlay’s 1971 death was un- 
timely, as is proved by the almost 
frightening excellence of the last 
two plates, illos for J.G. Ballard 
and Brian Aldiss stories. Hearty 
thanks to Beverly Finlay for allow- 
ing us to see this collection, and 
thanks to Gerry de la Ree for his 
excellent selection and for a moving 
and informative introduction. I shall

More OOTNO! My cheeks hurt 
from smiling. 

Sturgeon is the latest release from 
Alternate Worlds Recordings, which 
is as far as I know the only record 
company in the world that has yet 
to release a NOOTNO. This particu- 
lar disc is — oh, had you 

guessed? — Theodore Sturgeon read- 
ing from his own works, and it’s 
one of AWR’s most striking records 
yet. 

The first selection is “Bianca’s 
Hands,” one of Ted’s most incredi- 
ble stories. He himself tells an 
anecdote about an editor who read 
“Bianca’s Hands,” flung it across 
the desk and threw Ted out of his 
office, swearing that he would 
never so much as look at another 

136 



story by such a foul-minded pervert. 

It is clearly one of the most horrific 
horror stories of all time, and as 
with Lila I admire it tremendously 
but can’t exactly say I “enjoy” it. 
Creepy, man, and Ted’s soft, gentle 
reading really brings it j 
to . uh . life. i 

The second selection, “The i 
Hurkle Is A Happy Beast,” is also i 
one of Ted’s most famous stories, 
and I like it but not a whole lot. 

But the third piece is an excerpt 
from Ted’s long-awaited new novel, 
Godbody, a short segment he calls 
“Britt Svenglund” — and friends, it 
sounds like Godbody will have been 
well worth waiting for. This is the 
real Sturgeon, the man who has for 
nearly forty years been exploring all 
the forms and facets of human love. 
“Britt” is, as the liner notes say, 
“a poetic and lyrical celebration of 
art, of touching, and of love,” and 
it hints at a masterpiece. On the 
strength of it alone I recommend the 
album (write Alternate Worlds Re- 
cordings, 148 East 74th Street, New 
York NY 10021), and I’m dying to 
read the novel. 

Oh yeah, they’re also incom- 
prehensible liner notes by Samuel 
R. Delany, and the jacket illo is a 
reprint of the fabulous cover Ed 
Emshwiller did for Fantasy & Sci- 
ence Fiction’s all- Sturgeon issue 
— much nearer original size.

Eight books to go, and I can feel 
GALAXY 



that damned little black star (the 
one at the end of every column, 
turkey) creeping up on me. And 
that sort of reminds me of the new 
Larry Niven collection. 

Six of the nine stories in A Hole 
In Space are more or less gimmick 
stories, technological puzzles in 
which character-growth is subsidiary 
to plot. Nothing wrong with that, 
but in at least four of the stories the 
gimmick is identical: teleportation. 
Worse, the stories are #2-5, and by 
the last one you’ve heard some of 
the same speculations four times 
running. 

Larry had an essay in an earlier 
collection in which he outlined sev- 
eral story-gimmicks that would be 
inherent in any development of 
teleportation. These are them, 
faintly fleshed out, and by the 
fourth one I was wishing he’d just 
written a novel on the subject and 
had done with it. Ah well, they’re 
not bad stories, just sorta sketchy, 
and if they’d been scattered 
throughout the book I might not 
have minded so much. 

Also the collection has a splendid 
science fact essay, “Bigger Than 
Worlds,’’ which contains about a 
hundred more story ideas; and “The 
Hole Man,” an excellent yam with 
a powerful ending. On the other 
hand, there’s a short-short crime 
story, “$16,940.00,” which doesn’t 
belong in an sf collection and ain’t 
much of a story besides. 

On the other hand (sounds like 
Gil Hamilton), there’s “The Fourth 



Profession” (is that a lisping pun, 
Larry?), a 50- page novella which is 
among the best things Larry ever 
wrote (one of the few readable 
things I ever found in a Quark col- 
lection, its original appearance). It 
reminds me just enough of my own 
Callahan stories to tickle me — even 
though the resemblance is 
superficial — and it’s well-built. 

1 come up with 65% on the 
Spidermeter; I enjoyed it, but it’s 
by no means Larry’s best. 

★ ★ ★ 

The first story in A Hole In 
Space, “Rammer,” is also the first 
chapter of A World Out of Time, 
Larry’s newest novel. Both “Ram- 
mer” and the rest of the book have 
appeared in Galaxy (the latter as 
Children of the State a few months 
ago), so perhaps it is both redun- 
dant and unseemly to say much 
about the book here. I liked it, en- 
joyed it, admired parts of it tre- 
mendously, and kept turning pages 
until I was done. At that time I 
wished there’d been just a hair more 
emotional depth — but then it wasn’t 
meant to be that kind of a book. It 
rests on Larry’s gift for logical ex- 
trapolation, his incredibly fertile 
imagination, and his talent for teas- 
ing you along, and it rests there 
pretty comfortably at that. 

Oh yeah — ^Rick Stembach’s cover 
is — as always — beautiful. But they 
spelled his name wrong again. 

And now for the king-hell

blockbuster OOTNO of the year, a 
book that may literally change your 
life. 

It’s been a long time since I’ve 
read a book that impressed me on 
so many levels at once as Ze/i and 
the Art of Motorcycle Mainte- 
nance. The three solid pages of crit- 
ical raves in the front of my copy 
amuse me, because they remind me 
so much of the Twenty Blind Men 
who were introduced to an elephant; 
each quote seems to be talking 
about a completely different kind of 
book altogether, and they are all ac- 
curate. All 1 can say is, Zen is 
probably the most extraordinary 
thing I have ever read. It took me 
months to read it ... in fact, I be- 
lieve I’m still reading it. 

On one level it is simply what its 
title implies: an essay on motorcycle 
maintenance which emphasizes at- 
titudes as the mechanic’s most im- 
portant tool (“The study of the art 
of motorcycle maintenance is really 
a study of the art of rationality it- 
self. Working on a motorcycle, 
working well, caring, is to become 
part of a process, to achieve an 
inner peace of mind. The motorcy- 
cle is primarily a mental phenome- 
non.’’). 

On another level it is a philo- 
sophical exposition, which in 
Korzybskian tradition transcends 
Aristotle. On another level it is a to- 
tally rational proof of the existence 
of God. On another, the wrenching 
story of how arriving at that 
philosophical watershed drove Per- 



sig literally insane. On another, a 
psychological novel of a man trying 
desperately to relate to his son— to 
a son who was fathered by a per- 
sonality that no longer inhabits Per- 
sig’s Ixxly. 

In another sense it is the enor- 
mous and gripping science fiction 
story (in no way hampered by its 
literal truth) of how an entire 
species was condemned to confu- 
sion and misery (and perhaps de- 
struction) by the outcome of a 
power struggle between two schools 
of philosophy, centuries ago in an- 
cient Greece. 

It is, incidentally, a handbook for 
the staving off of that destruction, 
even now, in the eleventh hour; a 
guidebook for the resolution of the 
awful (and artificial) dichotomy be- 
tween man’s technological brain and 
his human heart and soul. 

Although Persig and certainly his 
publishers might be horrified to hear 
this, I maintain that Zen is sf, 
whether you take that to mean 
speculative or science fiction (or 
speculative or science /acr). It is a 
close look at the most basic assump- 
tions of science, and no one who 
claims to think or care about 
technology can safely ignore it. 1 
quoted it extensively in a panel at 
MidAmeriCon on “My Favorite 
World of Tomorrow” — it seemed to 
fit. 

Read it, and find out exactly what 
Quality, that mysterious, undefina- 
ble, every where-evident entity, re- 
ally is. With luck, it will turn your

world upside-down, the way it did 
Persig’s — and mine. 



I The bookracks are glutted with 
i Grand Classics From Da Golden 
I Age, all done up in new covers, 
! and you don’t need me to tell you 
that most of ’em are of interest only 
to historians and nostalgia-buffs 
(and English majors in need of a 
thesis). Here is a happy exception, 
one of those rare books that travels 
; so well through time that it will be 
; quite enjoyable in five hundred 
years. I’m not even a fantasy buff 
(in fact. I’m an admitted ignoramus 
about fantasy — a condition which 
Lin Carter has promised to cure), 
and I just love L. Sprague de Camp 
and Fletcher Pratt’s The Compleat 
Enchanter. 

The title is not precisely correct: 
three of the five novellae de Camp 
and Pratt wrote concerning Harold 
Shea are in this collection. The 
other two, “The Wall of Serpents’’ 
and “The Green Magician,’’ are al- 
ready available in book form, as 
Wall of Serpents. What this is, is 
the two once published in book 
form as The Incomplete Enchanter 
(I love triple puns), plus the original 
novella-length version of “The Cas- 
, tie of Iron’’ (also available in 
novel-length under the same title). 
Hence the new title. 

Puff, puff. Got that? 

Forget it. Just buy the book. I

ogy, Spenser’s Fairie Queene and 
Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso than a 
week in the library could have 
taught me, and I had a cracking 
good time along the way. Harold 
Shea is one of the most delightfully 
realized characters in sf — you feel 
you’d know him if you met him on 
the street — and he undergoes a pleas- 
ing and consistent growth in the course 
of the three novellae. Is anyone re- 
printing Wall of Serpents? I’d love 
to find out what happens to Harold 
next. (Do you know I’ve never read 
the Pratt/de Camp “Gavaghan’s 
Bar’’ series? Never seen a copy — is 
anyone reprinting them?) 

There’s also a fascinating af- 
terword by de Camp, “Fletcher and 



139 



I,” about Pratt and their collabora- 
tions, that definitely enhances the 
book. OOTNO all the way. 

★ ★ ★ 

Mail response has been good on 
sf-oriented poetry, and so for the 
second time I hand over the reins to 
my resident poet, friend and 
neighbor, Anne Trudell. When I 
gave her Aniara to review (see 
December, 1976 “Bookshelf”), she 
made the mistake of raving to me 
about a book called The Armies of 
the Moon, by Gwendolyn Mac- 
Ewen. “Okay, keed,” I said, “re- 
view that one too.” She’ll never 
learn. 

Here’s Annie: 

Some might quibble whether Mac- 
Ewen’s book is sf or not. 1 doubt 
that she intended it to be, but it is 
written in the shadow of the Ameri- 
can moon landing and many of its 
images would be more familiar to sf 
readers than to a reader of only 
mainstream fiction. 

What makes this a really great 
book of poetry? Well, I could read 
it about a hundred times and never 
get bored with it. It shakes the soul, 
mostly because it is about the soul, 
done not in the idiom of fields and 
flowers, but of moon walks, mad 
seamstresses, the Flat Earth Society, 
sea beasts, and buffets at the Sava- 
rin. Into the commonplace Mac- 
Ewen constantly injects an element 
of the cosmic, and surprises you 
into the realization that the world 



isn’t safe for doldrums after all. 
Sometimes she does this with 
humor, sometimes with a chill, but 
always with kaleidoscopic intensity. 

All of this makes for quite enter- 
taining poetry to be sure, but what 
makes one come back to the book 
again and again is the very real 
mysticism and metaphysics it con- 
tains. The cosmic is there in Mac- 
Ewen’s poetry not just for effect but 
because it is a part of man’s reality. 
Man’s rejection or ignoring of this 
does nothing to mitigate its effects 
or its expression in his acts: 

On the television screen 
Two ghostly blobs 
of men dissolve 
On the rim of 
a lunar crater 
And I know exactly 

what they’re hunting down 
Hour after hour 
in the seas without water 

And if nothing else, MacEwen’s 
poetry shows that the immensities 
of space are nothing beside the im- 
mensities within man: 

Computers map 
the territories 
of nether suns 
Where galaxies 
are graphic castles 
giants own 

Now up the weightless slopes 
of time he [the astronaut] climbs 
Through vacuous doorways 
to the gasping dark beyond

GALAXY 



Thanks again, Annie, and thanks 
to Gwendolyn MacEwen for sug- 
gesting that Galaxy is a graphic 
castle giants own — Mr. Abramson 
is flattered.

The little black star draws nearer, 
barely time for some minis (to foil 
charges of sex discrimination, next 
month I’m going to start calling them 
mickeys). 

The Deep, by John Crowley: 
quite a number of people have men- 
tioned this book in letters, and 
there’s a cover-blurb by Ursula Le- 
Guin that is highly complimentary. 
I’m sorry — I just couldn’t finish it. 
I found it turgid and confusing, fa- 
tally handicapped by the nearly iden- 
tical names which make it impossi- 
ble to recall who’s who, and boring 
even when 1 could figure out what 
was going on. 

You see. Red Senlin’s eldest son. 
Younger Redhand ... I mean. Red 
Senlin’s Son's son. Younger Red 
Senlin . no, no, Sennred ... I 
mean, Old Redhand’s son Sennred, 
who is actually younger than 
Younger Redhand . anyway, his 
brother Fauconred, see, is trying to 
steal the throne of Redred . 

I suggest you leave it Unred. 

Rocannon’s World, by Ursula K. 
LeGuin: the only thing I’ve ever 
read by Ms. LeGuin herself that I 
didn’t care for. The language is 
beauteous, some of the characters 
Just great — but the story itself limps 



and drags jerkily, and a really tre- 
mendous (when you think about it) 
ending comes across like an anti- 
climax. 

A genuine disappointment, I 
guess because of the height of my 
expectations. 

Sandworld, by Richard A. 
Lupoff: three convicts, a fat red- 
neck guard and a youngprettysexy 
social worker on their way to San 
Quentin drive straight into the 
Twilight Zone, and even the final 
“science fictional’’ explanations 
don’t get them out again. Alien 
vampires put me straight to sleep. A 
bionic turnip. 

By now some of you are ready to 
vote me out of the OOTNO 
Society — on account of six months 
ago I promised you a half-column 
on Harlan Ellison, and eight months 
ago I promised you a big spread on 
John Brunner, and I haven’t deliv- 
ered either one yet. Next month 
for sure. (This is a commitment as 
reliable as “The check is in the 
mail.’’) 

I know you’re expecting me to 
end with an atrocious pun, so I’ll 
just have to pass on the story of the 
young sf fan who once put on the 
top half of a pink satin tuxedo and 
threw a brick through the police sta- 
tion window. 

He offered no explanation for his 
behavior until the moment when he 
washed the ink from his fingertips 
and said:

WHO MURDERS, WHO DREAMS 
Jeffrey goddin 




Now and in the future, 
murderers are hunted 
by their dreams! 



RANTZ didn’t NOTICE 3S, with 
a deft touch, Phil dropped half-a- 
dozen tiny white spheres into his 
drink. He talked on and on. 

“You’ll think I’m old-fashioned, 
but this business of going from 
place to place in those damned plas- 
tic capsules. .’’ 

He stopped in mid-sentence, gave 
Phil a startled look. 

“Lehman, I feel. .’’ 

Then his body began to jerk. Phil 
avoided looking at Marantz’s fea- 
tures; they weren’t pretty, locked as 
they were in a typhoid grimace as 
the spasm shook him. It was over in 
ten seconds. The tiny spheres which 
Phil had dropped in Marantz’s drink 
were morphules, creatures that 
hatched in the warmth of the blood 
and immediately released a neuro- 
toxin as part of their growth process. 
They were a perfect murder 
weapon, thought Phil, as he slipped 
out of the booth and drew the cur- 
tain. The hydrochloric acid in 
Marantz’s stomach would have dis- 
solved the morphules by the time a 
■ patrol arrived. 

i Phil had left orders that they were 
not to be disturbed. The waiter 



probably assumed that they were 
lovers, since Philes were being en- 
couraged as a method of population 
control. 

He did not allow himself time to 
gloat over his victory, but searched 
quickly for a plasti-cab. Phil was 
lucky tonight. One of the tinted 
capsules, like the eye of a giant in- 
sect, came to rest almost as he 
stepped from the building. Phil rose 
into the cloud haze that covered the 
city and allowed the unerring 
machine to follow the coordinates 
that he punched into its driveface. 

The city was shrouded in thick 
fog where he came to rest. A river 
was being rejuvenated not far from 
his flat, and the atmosphere was 
pumped full of steam and carbon- 
dioxide to encourage plant growth 
along the banks. When the door slid 
back the low-oxygen air hit Phil’s 
lungs like a wet blanket. He knew 
that he must get home soon. It was 
a half-mile from the platform to his 
flat, and the combination of un- 
healthy atmosphere and the possibil- 
ity of derelicts haunting the fogs 
made him set off at a rapid pace. 

This was a mistake. Soon he was 
out of breath, and only half-way 
home. As he paused to rest two 
shapes loomed out of the fog. 

They were both dressed in tat- 
tered spacer uniforms, and both 
held small hand-stunners. He recog- 
nized the look in their eyes, the 
look of men who had failed to be 
re-conditioned to the Terran envi- 
ronment. He tried a bluff. 




[ WHO MURDERS, WHO DREAA« 



143 



“Name, rank, station!” 

“Elliot, thermal scientist second 
grade, Arctural satellite.” 

The other man smiled grimly and 
pushed his stunner into Phil’s 
stomach. 

“Your credits. All of them. 
Now!” 

As often when he went out at 
night, Phil was carrying a minimal 
amount of money. He knew that the 
man who hadn’t responded would 
be furious. But all he could do was 
hand over his thin wallet. 

The spacers grabbed the wallet 
out of his hand, emptied it. The in- 
stant that the taller man realized that 
Phil was no prize his foot lashed 
out in a plexis kick and Phil was 
down. 

As the spacers moved in to finish 
him off with their boots, the full 
irony of the thing hit Phil: Tonight, 
when he had disposed of his one 
enemy, the spacers would dispose 
of him. 

Phil Lehman closed his eyes and 
prepared to die. 

There came the sound of a scuf- 
fle, the ripping-cloth snarl of a 
stunner. Phil opened his eyes to see 
two patrol officers holding one of 
the spacers. The other was spread- 
eagled on the street, twitching 
spasmodically. 

“Are you all right, citizen?” 

Phil stood against the pain in his 
stomach, stumbled and grabbed one 
of the officers for support. Gradu- 
ally his head cleared. 

“Yes, yes, thank you.” 



‘We’ll accompany you to your 
residence.” 

★ ★ ★ 

Once inside Phil poured a stiff 
drink and flipped on the Environ- 
ment. It had been close, so 
close. He gratefully let his mind 
be carried away by the pictures that 
flowed across the quartzite ceiling, 
the music that flooded the room on 
a variety of comprehension levels. 
He had tuned in to one of the local 
stations, and the show would con- 
tinue until midnight. Afterward, for 
the more demanding citizens, the 
insomnia crowd, there would be 
complete dramas, or intellectual 
puzzles to decipher. 

He let his exterior mind follow 
the pictures, his nerves unwind into 
the threads of music. For the first 
time in months Phil felt truly 
happy. The man he had killed was a 
private agent who, due to the 
bounty system, would not have told 
anyone the identity of his suspect, 
Phil. Since the government had 
gone over to the bounty system as a 
more efficient means of tracking 
down its enemies, there were any 
number of private agents competing 
against one another. Phil’s anonym- 
ity was secure. 

As often in the past he let his 
mind seek out a half-dream that 
pleased him. He blacked out the 
walls and turned down the Envi- 
ronment. The images began to 
form.

She was tall, with long black hair 
and pale skin. Her eyes tilted up- 
ward slightly, and her lips were a 
trifle small, but perfectly formed. 
Together they were exploring the 
past through one of the new time- 
variable systems. They walked be- 
tween a dusty row of buildings 
where nothing moved but the 
wind — what they used to call a 
“ghost town.” Phil knew from his 
history tapes that these towns had 
sprung up in the early days of his 
country’s expansion in response to a 
mining industry which as often as 
not collapsed. Or they were on the 
trails where “cattle drives” once 
passed. The history techs had re- 
constructed their images so perfectly 
that a native of the era would not 
have known the difference. 

Some part of Phil’s fantasy mind 
had chosen one of these towns as a 
locale for the encounter. As always, 
the girl was beautiful. Each time, in 
fact, she seemed more lovely. He 
wore a gun, as befitted an irihabit- 
ant of the day, and now his hand 
rested on its butt as he searched the 
empty buildings. 

One of the structures caught his 
eye, and he stopped to investigate. 
TTie girl pressed up against him, her 
curiosity mingled with fear. Phil 
pulled his gun and kicked open the 
door. 

The building still had all of its 
furnishings, although the inhabitants 
had apparently abandoned the town. 
There were soft couches along the 
walls, elaborate candelabras above 




green gaming tables, a complete 
bar. He half-expected an old- 
fashioned “barkeep” to come out a 
side door and ask what they would 
have to drink. 

But no one appeared. Phil went 
and selected a liquor, filled glasses 
for them. They settled on one of the 
soft plush couches, drank until the 
bottle was empty, and then forgot 
about the bottle. 

Her lips were so soft, her long 
cool fingers so sensitive as they 
curled around his neck, her thin 
body so firm and eager. They 
stretched out on the wide couch and 
he drew her close.

WHO MURDERS, WHO DREAMS 



145 



Phil was awake in an instant. It 
seemed as though his dream had 
hardly begun. He checked the time. 
No, it was time to go to work all 
right. He quickly showered and 
shaved, then paused at the door. 

A message had been thrust under 
the door while. he slept. Phil un- 
folded the creamy paper and read, 
in neat script: 

I hope you know what you are 
doing, but I think not. You 
have severely misunderstood 
your cations and are thus mak- 
ing mistakes. I think we should 
get together in the MCL today 
for lunch and discuss the mat- 
ter. 

Phil broke out in a cold sweat. 
He did not recognize the writing. 
There was no signature, no indica- 
tion as to how he should recognize 
the man in the company cafeteria 
when he appeared. Had he been 
found out at last? He knew that 
Marantz had been close, but these 
people always worked alone. No, 
the only thing to do was to meet the 
fellow. For a moment Phil consid- 
ered taking some morphules along 
to lunch. He thought of their cool 
plastic container resting in the re- 
frigerator. No, and by the way. 
He got the morphules and flushed 
them, container and all, down the 
toilet. 

★ ♦ ★ 

Phil Lehman was a draftsman. He 
was good at his work. He was also 



rich, not from any recognition of 
his talents, but because he had sto- 
len several hundred thousand credits 
of Communitech funds four 
months earlier. He had done the 
job alone and, he thought, had left 
no traces — that is, until he had been 
contacted by Marantz. But it was 
too late to speculate on how he 
might have been found out. He 
could only move ahead. 

Lately Phil’s work had been more 
and more concerned with the area 
along the river. There were new 
spiralling apartments, needle-thin 
office buildings, the recreation areas 
with their characteristic mushroom 
shape, the greenery on top — all had 
sprung to life from Phil’s capable 
hands. 

It wasn’t that difficult. Structural 
stresses, basic proportional matters 
and weights were all in the comput- 
ers, as were the idiosyncracies of 
the different types of land in the 
vast city. All Phil had to do was 
add that touch, that creative element 
of adornment, of material texture, 
that human touch that would make 
the buildings each slightly different 
from all others of the type, and thus 
more livable. 

He worked hard that morning, 
and was surprised when it was time 
for lunch. He had actually forgotten 
his assignation. Should he keep it at 
all? The note was cryptic, and to 
answer it by his presence would be 
a kind of admission. But the alter- 
native? Constant watching and con- 
stant suspense. On his way through 



146 



GALAXY 



the outer office Phil decided. 

In a flash he was in the long 
blue-lit room where food was still 
prepared by hand for that, yes, that 
human touch. Phil assumed that his 
friend would find him, and he was 
not mistaken. 

He looked up from his martini to 
find a small, florid-faced tech grin- 
ning down at him. He pushed out 
the opposite chair with his foot, 
took another sip of the near-pure 
gin. 

“Mr. Lehman, Mr. Lehman, how 
good to finally make your acquain- 
tance! I am Engleman, Richard, and 
I have had the privilege of study- 
ing your work. You are,” he 
paused, “one of the best.” 

Phil examined the light green 
eyes that met his gaze above a large 
nose, small neatly trimmed mous- 
tache. The other’s speech inflection 
was just a shade off, despite the 
Germanic name. Not a Terran birth, 
Phil guessed. To the point: 

“Your note indicated something 
other than appreciation of my 
work.” 

“My note? Why, I sent you no 
note!” 

“This morning, under my 
door. .” Phil stopped. Was this 
Engleman being coy, or was this 
some dreadful mistake? He scanned 
the room: There were few people 
there, a cluster of female techs 
giggling in a corner, a few 
draftsmen from his own office, a 
dark girl seated alone near the food 
line. 

WHO MURDERS, WHO DREAMS 



Phil studied the girl for a mo- 
ment. She was pale, with long 
blue-black hair. He couldn’t see her 
eyes through the heavily tinted 
glasses that she wore. He wished 
frantically that he had looked more 
closely at the writing, but no, it had 
been in a kind of neutral script. 
And he had destroyed the note im- 
mediately. 

“Perhaps,” mused Engleman, 
“you have an unknown admirer.” 

“Perhaps.” 

“Mr. Lehman, how would you 
like to take on a small Job, outside 
of your Communitech work? I 
know,” it seemed as if he looked 
more closely at Phil, “that you do 
not have the highest paying trade in 
the city, although you may have 
something squirreled away. .” 

Phil searched Engleman’s smiling 
eyes. It was almost a hint, but not 
enough, that he knew about the 
theft. 

“Oh, but then it might have been 
you who stole all of those credits a 
few months ago.” 

Phil didn’t blink, and smiled 
wanly: 

“If I had. I’d have hardly stayed 
on Terra. But you spoke of a 
job. .” 

“I,” said Engleman, leaning 
closer, “am a man of business. I 
have, in fact, a very special busi- 
ness.” 

He flipped his lapel, a quick mo- 
tion, and Phil thought that he 
caught a tiny gleam of rainbow 
color. He leaned back, and sud- 

147 



denly, before his mind’s eye, there 
was a thickly foliated garden, with 
a mulatta wdking toward him with 
eyes like. 

A pleasure merchant! The long 
outlawed trade of the city, being 
plied by a tech! — if Engleman re- 
ally was a tech. In fact, if Phil had 
not himself frequented one of the 
gardens on the Moon, he would not 
have understood the image. But En- 
gleman had guessed that he would 
understand, and had been right. 

“But how, in the middle of the 
city. 

“This will not be built,” said 
Engleman, in a parent-to-child tone, 
“within the city. You are familiar 
with the wastes to the north of Me- 
tropolis A, where the radiation 
dumps were. .” 

Where the dumps were! They 
were still off-limits, as far as Phil 
knew. But this outlander seemed to 
know a lot. 

“Yes, you heard me correctly. 
There is no radiation there now. It 
suits the government to keep the 
land fallow, in the event that they 
might use it for one of their own 
schemes. And it is not patrolled, 
except on the perimeter.” 

“But how could customers. .” 

He could answer his own ques- 
tion. The customers would be very 
rich. They would have developed 
their tastes in the outworlds and 
would, quite probably, enjoy the 
thrill of a clandestine entry. 

It would be a daring operation 
indeed! 



“And you want me to design the 
actual garden?” 

“Precisely.” 

‘‘Do you know the trouble 1 
could get into?” 

“Of course. But you are a pru- 
dent man. And, I think, an avari- 
cious one.” 

Was tnis another veiled hint? 

“Yes, I suppose I am. Give me 
some time to think, to do some 
roughing out. 1 could meet 
you. .” 

“Next week, out at station A. 1 
might have something to show 
you.” 

★ ★ ★ 

During the week following his 
encounter with Engleman, Phil 
worked steadily and efficiently, and 
came home early each evening, that 
he might begin his dreaming earlier. 
He had grown very fond of the dark 
girl, and dreaded the time when his 
trained mind might reject her in the 
name of variety. 

On the very night before he was 
to again meet Engleman, Phil 
dreamed that he and the girl went to 
the seashore. He was not a water 
person, all air and intellect, but he 
chose the sea for its exotic implica- 
tions. He imagined the air flowing 
through her hair, the coolness of the 
night. 

They walked along the loose 
sand, his arm around her waist. She 
still wore the two-piece suit which 
she had worn that day. His hand 



148 



GALAXY 



marvelled at the firmness of her 
skin over her hips, the perfect in- 
curve of her waist. Suddenly she 
turned to face him, opened her 
strange violet eyes into his. He 
pressed her gently to his chest, feel- 
ing the downy coolness of her back 
as his hand trailed down to her 
hips. Her sharp breasts pierced his 
skin. 

Phil awakened with that strange 
feeling of anti-climax that his 
dreams had all been producing late- 
ly. No matter how early he fell 
asleep, the main dream simply would 
not be finished. He had even risked 
taking the time from normal 
tension-reducing dreams to flesh out 
his fantasy. He looked at the 
clock. What the Hell? It was barely 
midnight. Then he remembered his 
meeting with Engleman. 

II 

Phil took the plasti-cab to the 
northern sector of Metropolis A. 
Just before he landed a patrol flyer 
locked parallel with him and landed 
a few yards away. He got out, 
catching a series of strange scents 
on the night air, and stood to wait 
for the officers. 

The taller of the two demanded 
identification, which he had. Phil 
noticed that the other looked uneas- 
ily around as his identification was 
checked. It was indeed a rough part 
of the city, and a Friday night as 
well. There were a series of spacer 
bars here, where the least sophisti- 

WHO MURDERS, WHO DREAAAS 



cated segment of the population 
gathered for drinks and fights in the 
old pre-galactic style, but with 
off- world hand weapons. 

“What are you doing in this sec- 
tor, Draftsman? It’s not your kind 
of place.” 

“I have the need to loosen up, on 
occasion.” 

Phil debated bribing the officers, 
but, catching the smile of the taller 
one, he decided to proceed along 
this line. 

“One develops tastes, you 
see. .” 

“I understand,” said the officer, 
who Phil now saw had a long white 
scar from ear to chin, “But we’d 
hate to have to carry your body 
back tomorrow morning.” 

“I won’t stay long, just long 
enough. .” 

“Right. You’ve had your warn- 
ing.” 

The two officers disembarked 
quickly, leaving Phil in the open 
street. He fingered the small blaster 
in his pocket. It had taxed all of his 
ingenuity to get the weapon, and he 
thanked his stars that he had not 
been searched. Trust the company 
reputation. 

Three blocks. He passed the 
small bars lit with fluorescent guid- 
ers, green and purple predominat- 
ing. There were subliminal cues in 
those signs, but he firmly shut them 
out. The magistrates had decided 
that there could be one section of 
the city that would not be too 
strictly cleaned up, perhaps with the 

149 



hope that some of the superfluous 
population would eliminate itself. 
Phil walked quickly through the sec- 
tor. 

A beautiful mulatta beckoned 
from a doorway, a woman with the 
peculiar sandy tint of the Martian 
colony from another. No, nothing 
on the level of a Pleasure Garden 
here, simply dangerous old- 
fashioned booze, sex and drugs, 
witn me possibility of a really exot- 
ic disease thrown in. Perfect for the 
spacer tastes. 

Three young men staggered from 
one of the side streets, out into 
Phil’s path. He saw that their drunk- 
enness was feigned quickly 
looked around, saw no patrols, and 
pulled out his blaster. The trio 
froze, sized him up, then sidled 
away, muttering. 

Station A was the least sophisti- 
cated station in the city, which was 
ironic, since it had been the first to 
be established during the long re- 
construction of the city. Yet it still 
had the original diner, cab landing, 
bar. and even a few stores, clus- 
tered beneath the transparent shield 
that magnified the stars into shiver- 
ing globes of light. Phil walked 
down the dirty central corridor, 
through the heavy smells of stale 
urine and wine, found a bench and 
settled down to wait. 

Half-an-hour later Engleman ar- 
rived, dressed in a surveyor’s outfit. 
He even had a small clearance 
badge on his lapel. He carried a 
tight bundle under his arm. 



“Go into the restroom and put 
this on, quickly.’’ 

Phil went into the John and un- 
folded the bundle. He found an out- 
fit similar to Engleman’s, complete 
with security badge. He quickly 
slipped it on, bundling his own 
clothes back into the package. The 
blaster he slipped into one of the 
breast pockets of the uniform. 

“Ah yes,’’ said Engleman, as 
Phil emerged, “now we are ready. 
Follow me.’’ 

“Just a minute. Will these uni- 
forms. .’’ 

“Yes, they are real uniforms. Re- 
lax, Mr. Lehman, I’ve seen to ev- 
erything.’’ 

They walked through the station 
out to the perimeter. A high metal 
fence with its own power source 
threw a faint glow for several yards 
on each side. This was the visible 
boundary of “civilization.” 

They walked along the fence to 
the left for perhaps fifteen minutes 
in silence. A silvery figure came to 
view ahead, a figure that held a 
long-range blaster. 

“Halt. Identify.” 

“Surveyors First, two persons.” 

Engleman advanced and held out 
his identification. Phil slowly 
reached into the pocket of his cov- 
eralls and found his own. The guard 
noted the two luminescent badges. 

“What’s your business at this 
time of night?” 

“Periodical surveillance of the 
dumps,” said Engleman, as he held 
out a small recorder with visual at- 



150 



GALAXY 



tacbment which he had produced 
from his coveralls. “We’re check- 
ing luminosity as a measure of any 
residual radiation.” 

The guard stepped back. 

“Proceed.” 

A section of the fencing slid 
back, and the two men entered the 
waste sector. 

One of the first things that Phil 
became aware of was the weird 
fragrance of flowers. He couldn’t 
see them, but the scent was over- 
whelming, a mingling of spices and 
acid animal odors. Engleman pro- 
duced a pocket light and flashed it 
around. 

Rank vegetation filled the area, 
and over the top loomed blossoms 
unlike anything Phil had ever imag- 
ined. They were like baroque 
carvings, with huge dangling pistels 
and stamens protruding from vari- 
ously shaped clusters of petals. He 
noted one in particular, reddish, with 
petals like feathers, that seemed to 
be a vine running in around all of 
the others. He began slowly to ap- 
proach it, already distinguishing in 
his mind the carnal scent. 

“Mr. Lehman! Many of these 
plants are psychoactive, not to say 
outright dangerous, and the Escarlen 
vine that seems to have caught your 
attention is one of the most danger- 
ous. Needless to say, we will have 
to make certain protective provi- 
sions for our customers.” 

Customers. Immediately the diffi- 
culty of establishing a Pleasure Park 
out here began to assert itself. 



Could Engleman have lured him out 
here on a mere pretext? Was he, 
after all, Engleman’s quarry? But 
what could the man hope to gain by 
taking him out here? A confession, 
perhaps? 

“You’re wondering, of course, 
just how our customers will be able 
to get to the Garden? I happen to 
know that the government is con- 
sidering loosening the perimeter 
guards. They need the manpower in 
the city. And the few guards that 
stay could be bribed. The fence, of 
course, must stay, but there are 
ways around — or over — that.” 

A black path wound through the 
foliage, and Phil followed cau- 
tiously in Engleman’s steps. The 
thought crossed his mind that here, 
among these exotic flowers, would 
be an excellent place to eliminate 
his would-be associate. But then, 
how would he deal with the guard? 

They travelled perhaps two miles 
through the strangest terrain that 
Phil bad ever seen on Terra. The 
huge blossoms, oranges, reds, pur- 
ples and unearthly blues lined the 
path and seemed to beckon him off 
into the darkness. They were, of 
course, radiation mutants, but the 
dumps had long ceased to be active, 
while the mutants flourished and 
bred true. 

Suddenly the light failed to touch 
anything but blackness. Engleman 
switched it off, and Phil found that 
they were in a large clearing. He 
turned, and the lights of the city 
just paled the sky behind them. 



WHO MURDERS, WHO DREAAAS 



151 



“This clearing,” said Engleman, 
“is fifteen kilometers in length, two 
in width, covered mainly with ash. 
The actual layout, of course, I will 
leave to you. There is no real re- 
connaissance over this area, except- 
ing the bi-yearly geodetic check, 
and in two months we can have 
the gardens built and camou- 
flaged.” 

“But what will happen when they 
start to develop this area? 

“There are several reasons,” 
mused Engleman, “why they 
won’t, for many years to come. 
You’ve been working on the river 
project, I believe? Yes, inner-city 
problems are going to be of 
paramount importance for several 
years. And all of the crucial control 
centers are in the southern part of 
the city, near the new areas that I 
happen to know,” he laughed, 
“have been mapped out by the 
coordinator for the next expansion. 
By the time that this area is ready 
for development — or rather, by the 
time the government is ready — I 
will have made enough credits to 
more than justify my efforts, and 
yours. I will simply pull up and go 
elsewhere.” 

It was a convincing argument. 
Phil breathed the exotic fragrance of 
the night flowers, once again felt 
that subtle pull on his senses. 
Perhaps the flowers contributed to 
his curious state of mind. 

Because it suddenly became clear 
that, for all of his imagination and 
implied friends in high places, En- 



gleman was a fool. There were too 
many possibilities of discovery, be- 
yond the aereal survey teams and 
the perimeter guards. The patrons of 
the gardens might even be followed 
to the dumps. No, Phil became de- 
termined to extricate himself from 
the whole scheme. 

“So,” he could almost feel En- 
gleman’ s icy grin in the darkness, 
“you are going to help me?” 

“I don’t know. There are many 
loopholes, besides the need for me 
to find time to do the job.” 

“That could be easily arranged. I 
could have you transferred to the 
northern sector for. .hypothetical 
studies.” 

Phil did a mental flip. That much 
pull! He didn’t trust this little En- 
gleman at all. 

“No, I don’t think I’ll take the 
risk.” 

“After I took the risk of filling 
you in on all of my plans.” 

Engleman walked off a little way, 
played his light over the near wall 
of plants through which the two had 
walked. 

“I wasn’t going to mention this, 
but I really do need your services.” 
He approached Phil again. “I know 
who was responsible for that disap- 
pearance of funds four months 
ago. One of the easiest investiga- 
tions of my career. The guilty 
party, I might add, is not so very 
far from here. .” 

Before Phil had actually formu- 
lated the thought, his hand had 
found the small blaster and the 



152 



GALAXY 



night was heavy with the scent of 
burnt flesh. He picked up Engle- 
man’s light, flicked it off to test his 
night vision, then began to 
backtrack toward the fence. Phil felt 
a surge of exaltation, and quickly 
stifled it. He had to keep his mind 
clear and plan his every move for 
the rest of the night. 

There was still the guard to deal 
with. He walked slowly through the 
night, guiding by the stars above 
him. Soon he saw the faint 
luminescence of the fence ahead. 

At that moment there came a 
sharp pain in his left arm. Phil had 
strayed into the plants and one of 
them had tasted him. He shook his 
arm, testing the light numbness. 
There came a slight dizziness, 
which quickly passed. He moved 
ahead more slowly. 

Phil had only two choices; he 
could try and bluff his way out, ex- 
plaining Engleman’s absence as best 
he might, or he could take on the 
guard. 

There was a certain lucid mad- 
ness on him that night. Perhaps it 
was the plants. When he saw the 
guard just beyond the luminous 
fence he knew what he would do. 

“Guard, come here quickly, my 
friend’s hurt.” 

The sentry half-jumped, for Phil 
had come up without his light, 
wheeled around with blaster level- 
led. For a tense half-second Phil 
was sure the guard would shoot. 
Then: 

“What’s the matter with him?” 



“One of those damned mutant 
plants. It stunned him. 

The guard had himself been 
warned about the plants. He slid 
back the gate and moved forward, a 
light in his hand. When he saw Phil 
he paused a moment, then came 
forward. He had slung his blaster 
across his back. 

The light played across the brush. 
Weird flower heads nodded back in 
mock greeting, and that was all. 

“Where is he?” asked the guard, 
growing suspicious. 

“Here.” 

Phil shot him through the mouth 
and immediately turned away from 
the falling body. He then wiped his 
prints from the blaster and flung it 
deep into the mass of plants. 

★ ★ 

He moved as quickly as he dared 
through the northern sector. He had 
recovered his clothes and had tossed 
the disguise in the first incinerator 
he saw. There were officers patrol- 
ling by twos, and once he was 
stripped and frisked. He moved on. 

The sector was in full swing. 
Loud laughter, an occasional 
feminine voice lifted in outrage, 
eerie music from the garishly col- 
ored nightspots — all contributed to 
the carnival atmosphere. Phil de- 
cided that the best course would be 
to follow a couple of officers on 
their route, provided that they didn’t 
stop anywhere. 

He chose a likely-looking pair. In 

153 



WHO MURDERS, WHO DREAMS 



a few blocks they became aware 
that he was following them and 
turned back to frisk him. Finding 
him harmless, they gave him his 
third warning of the night and con- 
tinued on their way, while he fol- 
lowed at a more discrete distance. 

There was a cab station at the 
end of the sector, where the river 
made its most northemly loop. Two 
figures were just looming out of the 
shadows to Phil’s left as a plasti-cab 
came softly to rest. He rushed in 
and slammed the door. 

Now Phil let the primitive rush of 
joy overcome him. Once again he 
had foiled his enemy. The feeling 
, lasted and increased as he reached 
the flat. He immediately flipped on 
the Environment, took a quick 
shower, and lay down to let his 
mind unwind completely. He ex- 
pected great things from this night’s 
fantasy. 

By the time the system switched 
itself off he was adrift in a cloud of 
exquisite sensations, a mist of color 
with pale blues, silvers and 
magenta. He looked to die point in 
space where all of the colors 
seemed to converge, and suddenly 
there she was. 

She had never looked so beauti- 
ful. A faint breeze off of a nearby 
river floated her long black hair 
away behind her as those upward 
tilted eyes sought his. She was 
dressed in a gown of diaphanous 
black which clung to her boyish 
chest, her narrow waist, and blos- 
somed out around her long slender 



legs. He took her hand then, and 
they began to wander along the 
river. 

They came to a bridge of many 
spans that arched high over the wa- 
ter, lit by yellow arc lamps that 
have haloes in the fog. There on the 
bridge he kissed her, and their j 
kisses had all of the thrill of his I 
first boyish love. 

“We are going to my house,” i 
she whispered, as she gently took : 
his hand and led him across the old j 
bridge. i 

The section of town was old, in- 
deed. It had characteristics of the | 
British Georgian and Victorian I 
which he recognized from the his- 
tory books. They paused before a 
tall narrow place with two stacked 
balconies, barred by a high 
wrought-iron gate. 

Phil put his arm around her waist 
as they mounted the pale marble 
steps, threw back the wide panel- 
led doors. Inside was an opulent 
parlor of pearl grey, with light- 
colored wooden furniture and 
wainscotting. They sat on a long, 
low Victorian chaise lounge and she 
bent over him, brushing his brow 
lightly with her lips. In the light of 
green-shaded lamps she began to 
take on the aura of one of his more 
archaic fantasies, that of the vam- 
pire, the beautiful lover whose kiss 
is death, the exquisite lingering 
death of the true decadent. 

Phil ran his hands up her long 
cool arms, behind her neck. He 
reached for the top clasp of her 



154 



GALAXY 




bodice. She gently pulled away 
from him, teasing, but he took her 
more firmly and buried his face in 
her hair. 

Then, in his ecstasy, he began to 
talk to her, this beautiful figure of 
his dreams, to tell her of his life, of 
all that he had done. She could un- 
derstand, the terrible boredom, the 
thrill of his first theft, the double 
thrill of stalking his two enemies. 
She could understand, for her life 
was founded on the ecstasy of the 
unexpected, the challenge of erotic 
adventure. 

He told her of his all-consuming 
excitement at finally outwitting En- 
gleman, of the knowledge that he 
could never be caught, and he be- 
lieved that she really understood, 
for her face grew hot, her lips more 
lingering. 

Once again he reached out to take 
her. 

She stood, and smiled, the 
breathless smile of the true vampire. 
Her eyes bored into his with a fan- 
tastic pleasure, her small rounded 
lips half-parted, as if sharing in his 
triumph, and she bent to give him a 
burning vampire kiss that left him 
gasping for breath. She also reached 
into a small pocket in the back of 
her gown, between her buttocks, 
and took out a small long-barrelled 
blaster. 

“Philip Lehman,” she crooned, 
as the dream split like a shattered 
glass, “in the name of the Govern- 
ment of the City, 1 claim you as my 
prisoner.” ★

DIRECTIONS 



Dear Mr. Baen: 

I’m extremely puzzled by your December 
1976 Editorial Epistle to the Christians. 

You talk of the necessity of using "reli- 
gious impulses” to boost us off into space. 

Well now — from wide reading of other 
Editorials, Articles, letter columns, and Fan- 
zine discussions. I’ve gathered a fairly con- 
cise idea of what "religious impulses” are. ' 

“Religious impulses’’ are nothing more 
than senseless, superstitious archisms ^/c], 
founded in ignorance, upon the weakness of 
emotion, and maintained in blind, brain- 
washed faith. 

They are beliefs with no foundation, no 
support, no reasons, no facts behind them, 
only the status quo of miUenniums [s/c] of 
repeated assertion. 

Some people maintain such "religious im- 
pulses” because these beliefs were so deeply 
etched into the groves [s/c] of their brains in 
early childhood and reiterated and pounded 
deeper during growing up. 

When grown, they are unable, despite 
overwhelming evidence to the contrary, to 
throw off these shackling beliefs. 

Those who retain these “religious im- 
pulses” refuse to think for themselves. They 
will not see the world objectively, scientifi- 
cally, rationally. They simply ignore the 
cold, hard facts and inconvenient aspects of 
science in their incautious mania to believe 
the literal assertions of their illogical convic- 
tions. They are afraid to face life as it truly 
is. 

Surely, Mr. Baen, you must recognize, 
that in our enlightened, educated times, most 

156 



science fiction readers are mature, intelligent 
people, whom have no such primitive “re- 
ligious impulses” at all. 

They’ve grown up, as I say, and realize 
what “religious impulses” actually ate: just 
left-over superstitions formed back in times 
of ignorance and fear. 

I find your statement “Thus if God spoke 
unto the Prophets of Israel. .” most baf- 
fling. 

Who is this “God”? 

And what has he to do with us today, and 
our exploration of space, if he lived 
thousands of years ago in the “Late 
Neolithic”? And how in the universe could 
anything he said way back then be relevant 
to us today? 

How do you even know if he ever really 
existed? After all, there are no authentic rec- 
ords dating back that far. 

Please, would you explain this? 

What I really find so disturbing, shocking 
even, is your sixth paragraph. 

You instruct us to instigate subversion, in- 
surrection, and revolution, commit criminal ! 
acts, engage in treason, or do anything else 
necessary, if it serves to “further the prog- 
ress of humankind into space.” 

Do you realize the implications of what 
you’ve said? 

Can you visualize the results of application 
of your directive? 

How can you Justify what you’ve J 
suggested? j 

Also, you imply that we should go into 
space simply because this “God” says we 
should. 

Why should we let him dictate to us what 
we should do? 

Isn’t allowing this “God” to direct our ef- 
forts and lives contrary to human progress, 
and detrimental to the development of the 
human race? 

Surely, it is clear, anyone such as this 
“God,” who tries to restrain us, to control 
us, to decide for us, we must resist with all 
our might, and, if necessary, destroy. 

Isn’t this clear? 

We must fight for our freedom from Hint 
just as we have fought for our freedom from 
others before.

I think this is clear. 

Again, please, who is this “God”? 

Lee Smith 

Unlike religious beliefs, which arise out of 
them, religious impulses cannot be "founded 
in ignorance": they are a built-in facet of 
the human condition, like territoriality or the 
sex drive. And while they can indeed be per- 
verted, witness ritual cannibalism, claim- 
jumping and rape, they cannot be founded 
on perversion, since they are earlier in the 
scheme of things. 

And what is this "overwhelming evi- 
dence" to which you refer? Science is noth- 
ing more than a complex set of observa- 
tions and deductions based on the well 
tested but fundamentally unverifiable infer- 
ence that if condition ‘A’ leads to resultant 
‘B’ once, it will do so every single time unto 
the Final Trump, as it were. Or, to put it 
another way. Science is a modern religion 
whose single article of faith is that reality is 
consistent, and therefore its mechanisms can 
be understood through observation and de- 
duction. But it does not have a single thing 
to say about the underpinnings of that reali- 
ty! Ask a scientist "Why is Nature consis- 
tent?" and he can but look at you blankly — 
or answer you as a non-scientist. 

Finally, as for that especially dubious 
sixth paragraph, all the things you claim are 
being promulgated by it would further noth- 
ing but the disintegration of society, some- 
thing hardly conducive to a flourishing space 
technology. 

Dear Mr. Bacn, 

1 was quite disappointed by your editorial 
“Epistle to the Christians.” 1 too feel that 
God’s commandment “Be fruitfull, and mul- 
tiply, and replenish the earth. .” may have 
a greater meaning than it’s literal one. How- 
ever, if you were to limit population people 
would be more inclined to stay on the earth. 
Look around. There are very few idealists 
that want to “get off” and the rest will have 
no desire to leave as long as it is comfortable 
here. With a zero population growth things 
here are not likely to get much worse and 
will more probably make things even more 



comfortable for the individual. Things will 
have to get much worse before enough 
people will decide a change is in order. So 
by limiting population you would be accom- 
plishing the opposite of what you desire. 

Besides, so far God has not been very 
cooperative in our search for reasonable 
methods of reaching the stars. Perhaps if 
more of us would listen to His command- 
ments, instead of trying to suspend them. He 
would give us a hand. 

Sincerly,

Your view is curiously similar to that of doc- 
trinaire Marxists: that any amelioration of 
social inequities should be opposed on the 
ground that if the masses are made less mis- 
erable the day of revolution will be thereby 
postponed. It is my conviction that any such 
doctrine is pernicious to the core. On more 
practical grounds, only a relatively wealthy 
society is capable of diverting the requisite 
resources for the development of a full- 
fledged space economy. Also, I think you 
underestimate both human idealism and 
human contrariness: for example in the year 
2050 I imagine there will be at least one 
O’Neill colony manned solely by members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day 
Saints!
