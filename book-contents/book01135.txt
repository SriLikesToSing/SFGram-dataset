A lost ship, carrying Earth's 
dying dreams — and man's 

eternal— 


by JACK WODHAMS 


«r ORTY YEARS.” Ladlow switch- 
r ed off as the replay came to 
an end. “Forty years since Swinson 
and Tulley made the round trip 
to Centauri. And what do we have 
to show for it?” He gazed with 
some bleakness at the wall that 
held his record copies. “Nothing. 


A handful of reports — negative, 
negative, negative.” He slouched 
back in his chair. “Jass, if we 
don’t find some Aztecs soon, the 
program is going to die. When 
I took over twenty years ago, 
there was still plenty of hope to 
sustain the appropriation. But we 


- 



humans are not indefinitely pa- 
tient and faith has become the 
province and preserve of the egg- 
head minority. Jass, we’re in a 
decline and it’s going to take 
something good to pull us out. 
We’ve got to find something, to 
show, something bearable, some- 


thing with promise for people.” 
Jasper Lemac said, “It really 
is getting serious, then? I know 
that in some quarters criticism has 
been getting more severe lately, 
but I always understood that the 
project would not be abandoned. 
The commitment — ” 


45 


Ladlow flapped him down. 
“Save it. Senator Muldersen died 
five years ago. His ‘Search for 
a Thousand Years’ speech died 
with him. The vision became tar- 
nished. Look, I don’t have to tell 
you the record. Thirty suns 
visited — thirty-one counting this 
last, twenty-four of them F-G-type 
approximations to our own. And 
what have we found? Plenty of 
interesting material and miles of 
data but not one thing to justify 
hope. You see one hostile world 
and you’ve seen them all.” 

“There must be compatible 
planets somewhere. The odds — ” 
“The odds are against it,” 
Ladlow finished for him. “The 
permutations are endless — too 
near, too far, too hot, too cold, 
too large, too small, too 
changeable. We humans are too 
damn fussy. Just because a world 
has a four-hour day, or has a 
ninety-degree rotational axis, has 
a couple hundred million miles 
difference between aphelion and 
perihelion or is soggy with 
methane or — to hell with it. It 
seems logical to assume that there 
must be another Earth-similar 
world somewhere. But from what 
we’ve found so far it would be 
cheaper and make more sense to 
expand the Mars Observatory. 
Who in his right mind would want 
to settle there? We need greener 
pastures. A spur. Some new fresh 
place that can hold the promise 
of high adventure. We need 

46 


dragons to kill, strange life forms 
to contend with. I used to smile 
at conceptions of aliens — but not 
any more. The less we find the 
more solitary we get — like a kid 
in a playground at midnight.” 

Lemac said, “The life we’ve 
found is primitive, maybe, spe- 
cialized, true — but it’s an indica- 
tion that the basic elements of 
life are common enough. We have 
only to persist and sooner or later 
we are bound to find some more 
than halfway agreeable satellite.” 

“Well, yes, that is your belief 
and faith. If not this time, then 
maybe next time. It’s hope that 
keeps you going. As captain, you 
need all the hope you can get. 
But after this trip, Jass, there 
might not be a next time.” 

Lemac nodded. “I get the drift. 
You think there will be a slow- 
down after this? You think there’s 
a chance that the opposition may 
get their way?” He read Ladlow’s 
face. “If 1 come back again with 
nothing but the spanlog and the 
usual collection of samples — it 
won’t help keep the program 
afloat.” 

“That’s about it,” Ladlow said 
bluntly. “Except that the slow- 
down’s already here. Yours is the 
last journey that I am confident 
will be fully funded without 
hitches. Rayner is due back in 
a couple years — and if he has 
nothing from his single hit then 
much will depend upon you. Ow- 
ing to the persistent absence of 

GALAXY 


inspiring discovery, the craft con- 
tractors have had no great in- 
centive to improve their product. 
You’ve studied your vessel. The 
innovations could have been made 
and costs cut years ago but it 
was profitable and less trouble 
to turn out the proven article. 
You’re one of our last hopes. 
You're an experienced com- 
mander with two forays already 
under your belt. And, knowing 
what’s at stake — it might occur 
to you to interpret the rules more 
freely. Third time lucky, eh? Make 
the most of it. 

T hird time lucky, Lemac thought. 

With the E.T. differential im- 
proved by twenty per cent, he 
would call not just on one star 
but three. Lucky three again. 

Three stars. No one had ever 
investigated three systems on one 
outing before. Ernswiller had once 
covered two and was given a 
sinecure desk job afterwards. 

This time, Lemac, let us be 
the ones to find. 

So far nothing. Yet there had 
to be. There had to be another 
like Earth somewhere. Thirty-one 
suns. Maybe Rayner would hit 
it with number thirty-two. 

Twenty thousand stars, Lemac 
thought. For him, numbers thirty— 
t h r e e — thirty-four — thirty-five. 
Yes. Three of them. Out of the 
five-year tour, that meant that they 
would be awake a total of 
anything up to twelve months. 

STARHUNGER 


Lemac stared into darkness. 
Number thirty-one. Too bad 
about Dyk and Vladyar. Didn’t 
he know it? The relief of getting 
home again, the one known , 
livable place in the entire heavens. 
Whose fault? Theirs? The con- 
trollers? One slip, one circuit 
opening or closing when it should 
not? In, down, down too fast, 
sane vessel gone crazy — to smash 
itself into frenzied white-hot 
pieces in the Mozambique Chan- 
nel and hurl shattering frag- 
ments, blast and tidal eruption 
at tiny Mayotte Island. 

That, a tragic accident, won 
little sympathy. People did not 
understand. The roar of the im- 
pact had hardly died before there 
was a petition for compensation 
for damages. Dyk, Vladyar and 
the team? Who cared about them? 
Spacemen were no novelty. What 
good did they do,^ anyway? 
Nobody begged them to go Out 
There, did they? They were self- 
elected mostly, weren’t they? They 
were adventurers, an elite of their 
own making, bringing back 
capsules of gas and maybe some 
bits of rock from a short touch- 
down — oh, great. Billions and 
billions spent for a few old lumps 
of rock, some queer little worms, 
a dead beetle-thing and a noxious 
moss-fungus that required the at- 
tention of three highly paid 
technicians to keep it alive — what 
for, for God’s sake? 

To hell with space. If they 

47 


could afford that kind of money 
for that kind of result, then they 
could put up the hundreds — the 
few thousands — it would take to 
re-roof the house and replace the 
windows. 

People. 

It was lonely to be a believer. 
Even on Earth. Especially on 
Earth. Out There somewhere was 
another Earth. This Lemac knew. 
Preacher of the promise of space. 
No tall stories to substantiate with 
facts, no giants, no sirens, no 
hundred-eyed monsters. Oh, God, 
Lemac thought, what he wouldn’t 
do to have the privilege of 
discovering a genuine and terri- 
fying monster. 

This time. Maybe this time. 

Sun #33 

“Which of the two shall we 
tackle first,” Copffe debated. 
“The outer one is closest, but the 
inner one is — ” 

“Neither,” Lemac said shortly, 
snapping to a decision. “We’re 
not going in. It would obviously 
be a waste of time.” 

Copffe raised his eyebrows. 
“We have to get atmospheric 
samples. We could possibly land 
on the smaller of the two, and — ” 

“We certainly are not,” Lemac 
reiterated, “going in. Two worlds 
circling each other on a common 
orbit may be very interesting, but 
neither holds the least promise for 
us.” 

“Pardon? I don’t think I — ” 

48 


"Here there is nothing within 
the band of human desirability. 
The nearest thing to another Earth 
is the sixth — and that appears to 
be nicely frosted with carbon 
dioxide crystals, right? So we’re 
moving on, Mr. Copffe, to see 
what the next has to offer.” 

“What? We can’t do that, Cap- 
tain. We have to make a reliable 
survey, check out the probability 
factors and correctly list what we 
have found for future reference. 
Come, come, Captain, we haven’t 
traveled this far just to take 
a glance around and buzz off 
again.” 

“But assuredly we have,” he 
answered quietly. “I’m feeding the 
new course into the navicom. Get 
what you can from out here. In 
three hours I want us all prepared 
to sack out again.” 

Copffe could not take it in. 
“You do intend to leave? But you 
can’t, Captain. Now, please, this 
is not a joke. I don’t want to 
quarrel with you or remind you 
of the limitations upon your 
authority — but 1 have my obser- 
vations to make and I intend to 
make them. I have to make them. 
Captain, let us not argue the mat- 
ter, please.” 

“I’m not arguing the matter.” 
And Copffe could see that Lemac 
was indeed in deadly earnest. “In 
approximately three hours we 
shall proceed.” 

“Captain Lemac, this I cannot 
permit. You must reconsider, and 

GALAXY 


at once. Such a decision is too 
arbitrary. Without any previous 
discussion or consultation, really. 
Captain, such ill-considered pre- 
cipitance has no place in team- 
work. Our presence here is first 
and foremost a scientific un- 
dertaking, and I sincerely trust 
that your stated obligation to the 
furtherance of knowledge is not 
to succumb to an irrational 
response to a familiar disappoint- 
ment.” 

“Mr. Copffe, we’re going on.” 
Lemac controlled himself. More 
quietly he said. “Lam in charge 
of this craft, its operation and 
disposal. It is for me to determine 
the course that is to be taken, 
the course most fitting to take.” 

Copffe reddened. “The vessel 
has been entrusted to your care 
that you might serve the specialist 
personnel on board to the best 
of your ability. Your jurisdiction 
is over the management and 
handling of the vessel under the 
direction of the scientists on 
board. I am the head of this ex- 
pedition in title and in fact. I 
have respect for you. Captain, 
which I would like to retain — so 
let us please have no more of 
this aberrant proposal to move 
on. We have a job to do and 
I intend that we shall do it.” 

Lemac perspired gently but 
refused to waver. 

Lucky three. Make the most of 
it. 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Copffe. I did 

STARHUNGER 


not expect to meet with your ap- 
proval. My decision is made and 
nothing will change it.” 

Copffe took umbrage. “Captain 
Lemac, this is inexcusable. I find 
your attitude is alarmingly un- 
compromising. I think it would 
be well to convene all members 
to discuss this matter more for- 
mally. Just to — ” 

“My mind is made up, Mr. 
Copfee. Whatever the general opin- 
ion, I run this ship and I decide 
where this ship is to go. It sounds 
autocratic and yes, it is autocratic. 
But I feel beyond measure the 
utter sense of uselessness of 
painstakingly sounding and then 
enumerating the value of planets 
that cursory sighting and test 
clearly indicate are unsuited to 
even marginally support human 
life. We need a live world and 
we need one badly. We must find 
that place which humans can 
readily relate to.” 

“Oh, come. Captain, please, 
don’t tell me that you subscribe 
to the belief that there is some 
wonderful world to be found in 
the sky. Analysis of the ex- 
ploratory information gathered to 
date does not exclude the 
possibility but the probability is 
not very high. This you know. 
But we cannot know how impor- 
tant may be our diligent acquire- 
ment of the information that 
might be revealed here — ” 

“I’m sorry,” Lemac said again, 
slightly pale but adamant. “1 think 

49 


that science has been sufficiently 
served. What we need now — ” 

“Captain,” Copffe interrupted, 
“what do you know? You are 
an agent of your superiors. The 
codifying of these areas is to an 
overall concise record beyond 
your cognizance. You are an in- 
strument— I was given to under- 
stand, a capable, experienced and 
reliable instrument. Now here you 
confront me, suddenly childishly 
motivated to run to the next 
flower before the nectar of this 
one is tasted.” 

“There is no nectar here,” 
Lemac growled. “Dead worlds 
from the sun on out. They have 
curiosity values, yes. but not to 
us. To a later generation perhaps. 
We have no time to linger over 
patently inhospitable planets.” 

Copffe’s voice rose in ex- 
asperation. “Who are you to 
declare what is and what is not 
useful? Are you a scientist? You 
are a servant paid to do a specific 
task. You far exceed your wisdom 
when you presume to take 
absolute command to the detri- 
ment of the project.” 

“The project.” Leipac twitched. 
“What is the project? Is it con- 
cerned with people any more? Or 
is it concerned with things just 
for the hell of it? There is nothing 
here for people. It might gratify 
you to find an odd streak in a 
spectrum, certainly — but the re- 
petetive message is death. People 
want life.” 


“And you want to chase off 
and find it? Another Earth, really! 
Captain, I supposed you to be 
much harder-headed and more 
pragmatic than that. That you 
should allow yourself to fall vic- 
tim to the traditional Spaceman’s 
Dream — ” 

“You do not believe that such 
planets do exist?” 

“I keep an open mind. Some 
day perhaps, a world more conge- 
nial that the average may be 
discovered. But sensibly we shall 
come to it in good time. Flailing 
off in an attempt to find it sooner 
reflects a juvenile mentality.” 

“Yes.” Lemac nodded. “You 
have three hours to sacktime. 
He pointed with finality at the 
chronometer. “Use it to learn to 
dream young and to cram what 
you can of this system into your 
records — it’s all the time you have 
here.” 

He made himself deaf to 
Copffe’s beginning splutterings 
and was presently alone with his 
instruments and purpose. 

So that was that. Lemac knew 
the odd relief of conflict resolved. 
And oh, brother. How more 
sharply dubious the cause at once 
became. 

Sun #34. 

“Copffe is livid,” Radsdasti 
said. “My impression was that he 
wanted to come storming up to 
see you but didn’t trust himself 
to be able to speak.”

GALAXY 


“Oxygen is one thing, three and 
a half G's are another.” Lemac 
double-checked co-ordinates, set 
the navicom to prove out the pro- 
blem from another angle. “He's 
still suffering from shock. I don't 
think he really believed we would 
pull away so abruptly.” His eyes 
glinted. “He’s right in so many 
ways but wrong in feeling. He 
doesn’t, or just will not recognize 
it. I’m not sure that I recognize 
it myself. It’s just— something 
inside cries out. And then 
something gives and before a man 
is aware, he has a conviction he 
finds impossible to deny.” 

“Well, you sure can’t back out 
now. Did you know this is his 
first time Out? He keeps calling 
it a field trip. Jass. He might be 
more upset than you know.” 

“I know how upset he is.” 

“He envisions the end. A three- 
star call on a souped-up ship 
could be the last for quite a while. 
He wanted to cover the systems, 
turn in superlative reports.” 

“Yes.” Lemac leaned over the 
console. “It’s become a habit.” 
He straightened moodily to pace 
his short deck. “Copffe doesn’t 
believe in life. He’s a super- 
geologist content to marvel over 
the colors he gets from enormous 
rocks through his spyscopes.” 
Lemac spat. “Figures, statistics, 
correlations.” He smacked his 
palm against a bulkhead. “There 
must be people out here, or some 
place where people can be. Not 

STARHUNGER 


just the Earth. We’ve got to 
spread. It can’t be empty. I don’t 
know how he can look out there 
and be so calm when everything 
he sees says that the only known 
sanctuary is the Earth. Dusty, 

there have to be other places.” 
“That’s the way I figure, too.” 

Radsdasti sighed somewhat. “But 

the alternates sure do hide. Did 
you ever read about Tasman? He 
managed to sail all the way 

around Australia and never sight 
it once. He went home and said 
there was nothing there. We’re 
like that. We could so easily be 
taking a line of dead ones while 
running parallel to live ones.” 
“Yes.” Lemac rubbed his face.* 
“We can only hope on the next 
one.” He took the step to the 
plotting table. “The next one.” 
He looked meaningly at 
Radsdasti. “Sound off the two- 
hours to breakaway.” 

“This he’ll never forgive you.” 

Sim #35. 

“A binary.” Lemac stamped 
his feet and swore. “A binary, 
by God! How in hell did they 
come to list that?” 

Copffe smiled, not without a 
flicker of malice. “It’s quite an 
easy error to make. On a plane 
inclined to our home observatories 
there is an absence of occulation 
and the companion is a singularly 
weak source. It does help to ex- 
plain the intermittent strength of 
the titanium bands. I had the 

51 


theory that it would be something 
of this sort.” 

“You mean that you guessed 
it was likely to be a binary?” 
Lemac choked. “Why didn't you 
tell me?” 

Copffe replied classically, “You 
never asked.” His false sweetness 
vanished for tartness. “The object 
of our journeying was to elicit 
the component structures of three 
systems. Very slight variations 
from this star gave rise to several 
theories — some even conjectured 
interference by intelligent life. 
This still could be so. The ex- 
tremes of climate and gravita- 
tional diversity upon the attendant 
bodies do not necessarily pre- 
clude all life but then” — sar- 
donically — “such bodies have lit- 
tle to commend them to human 
accommod a tion . ” 

“A binary.” Lemac shook his 
head. “Of all the luck. And you 
knew. Scientific investigator. A 
minor discrepancy at home and 
' it’s, ‘Oh, Mr. Copffee, while 
you’re Out There we’d like you to 
call and check this to settle an 
argument.’ ‘By all means — it is 
my pleasure. No, no trouble at all. 
Any little thing to increase the 
sum and bulk minutiae of 
knowledge that we’ll have no use 
for, at least not for centuries. ’ ” 
Lemac’s worktable bounced as he 
thumped a fish upon it. “Dammit, 
Copffe, can’t you sec that we need 
something more now? We’ve 
gathered enough facts already to 

52 


bury us. We’ve touched the ti- 
niest fraction of our galaxy, but 
the mass of data is piled high, has 
grown overwhelming. Not one 
scrap has been produced to heart- 
en and encourage. Oh, the learn- 
ed are interested — but do you 
know the feeling that is gripping 
people? The feeling we are getting 
is that the Earth is it, that what 
Earth has is all there is, that the 
Earth is the ultimate and the end 
of the road. And this, Mr. Copffe, 
when you look through the 
viewport at infinity, is a terribly 
frightening thing.” 

Copffe cleared his throat. 
“Captain, you can scarcely expect 
me to appreciate your attitude. 
Your recent behavior, I con- 
fess, quite numbed me. Out 
of nowhere, most astonishingly, 
you appear to have abandoned 
yourself completely to emo- 
tionalism. 1 hat these suns prove 
to support no Earth-approximate 
world is of secondary impor- 
tance.” Copffe held up a hand 
to halt an impending interjection. 
“Let me finish. If such a world 
exists, our steady progression will 
find it. In the meantime, we have 
visited three suns — what have we 
to show for it? As this is the 
last, perhaps you will permit me 
to make more than a fleeting 
inspection? We have had — what? 

7 wo hundred waking hours so 
far? Scarcely a week — and we 
have occupied three stations. Ad- 
ding to that the between-time of 

GALAXY 


three years — what have we to 
render upon our return? A 
sketchy,- skimpy, unresolved col- 
lection of snippets.” 

Lemac said, “Let me know 
when you’ve finished.” 

Acidly Copffe continued. “You 
have repudiated discipline en- 
tirely. Five years will have lapsed 
before our return — five years for 
my colleagues, who will be 
presuming that I am reliably car- 
rying out my work. No doubt we 
shall return somewhat earlier, eh? 
But it is not I who will answer 
for the appalling inadequacies of 
the surveys and the scandalous 
waste of traveling time. When we 
get back, Captain — ” Words fail- 
ed him. “In the future, you may 
be sure, there will be more rigid 
control of ships’ personnel.” 

“I don’t doubt it,” Lemac said, 
not a little sour himself. “But 
I didn't exactly advertise my sen- 
timents and I don’t suppose 
another man will either. I have 
thought about this project a long 
time, Mr. Copffe. Believe me, this 
was no wild impulse on my part. 
But as a member of the establish- 
ment at home, you are well 
aware of how an application for 
a roving commission would have 
been received. These expeditions 
tie up too many government and 
institutional funds to let one man 
ramble fancy free to cover as 
much space as possible. So. This 
is a fling — maybe a last one. I 
could see no other means to 


achieve a broader and faster way 
to eliminate systems.” 

“You have performed what 
amounts to an act of piracy — and 
a lot of good it has done you,” 
Copffe stated. “You have achiev- 
ed nothing. We can do what we 
can here to salvage what we may 
from our abbreviated voyaging, 
but that will hardly suffice to re- 
deem your gross breach of office.” 
“No,” Lemac said. “It might 
be tricky, at that. I’d say after 
this that I . was finished in the 
Service, wouldn’t you?” 

Copffe blinked. “Yes. That is 
unavoidable. At this time I feel 
disinclined to even think about 
extending pleas on your behalf. 
However, some acknowledgment 
on your part and a return to 
responsible behavior would help 
your case considerably.” 

“How nice,” Lemac said with 
faint humor. “Mr. Copffe, I don’t 
think that you have yet fully 
grasped my intention. We are not 
staying here and we are not going 
home. We are going on to the 
next.” 

Copffe stiffened. “The next?” 
“Yes. We have unquestionably 
drawn a blank here, right? This 
being so, be ready by zero-six- 
five. Shortly thereafter our tail 
shall be chasing us again.” 

Sun #36. 

“Jonny, he is a dangerous 
man,” Copffe said. “What is 
worse, Radsdasti and Doil are 

53 


STARHUNGER 


equally affected by him. Thus 
there is no hope of influencing 
the crew and of ourselves taking 
command. We are completely at 
his mercy. Quite frankly, I’m 
stumped as to what we might do 
about it.” 

Melda Jonson removed a full 
reel and replaced it from plentiful 
stock with a fresh one. 

“He’s a romantic who refuses 
to let go,” she said. “It’s touching 
in a way — but a romantic often 
is. He can’t go on forever, can 
he?” 

“I’m not sure.” Copffe ran 
fingers through his hair. “He is 
deaf to counsel. How do you 
shake a dreamer loose from his 
dream? Will he ever be ready to 
relinquish it? Especially when it 
cannot be refuted that somewhere 
there may well be a shabby barely 
livable version of the dream in 
actuality? It comes chillingly close 
to being an obsession with him 
and I fear that continued failure 
will aggravate rather than bring 
about resignation.” 

“But his resources are not 
unlimited,” she observed, “and I 
don’t think he’s so stupid as to 
play himself permanently into 
Nowhere.” 

“I wish I could be confident 
of that.” Copffe fidgeted wor- 
riedly. “He appears reasonable 
enough up to a point, but there 
is a risk in taking repeated doses 
of hibernol at such short intervals. 
We’re awake for such negligible 

54 


time periods and the cumulative 
effect of repeated hibernation could 
be disastrous. His scan-artd-depart 
technique might stretch his stores 
to an indefinite degree. But the 
saving won’t be helpful if we all 
go into coma.” 

“He is limited by his quantity 
of hibernol and by his sup- 
plies — but most importantly by 
his power reserves,” Melda said. 
“He can’t endlessly jump from 
star to star. He’ll be forced to 
run back to Old Sol before long. 
That is — ” she grimaced — “in 
about eight years or so real time, 
according to Doil.” 

“Great heavens.” Copffe 
pinched his cheek-bones in dis- 
may. “He can’t do this. No, really, 
Jonny, it’s too much. He has no 
right, none whatsoever. This is 
purely his own idea and goes 
completely against every modern 
concept of debate and discussion. 
He just won’t listen.” 

The wall-speaker hissed and 
blatted: “Attention please. Atten- 
tion please. Departure in thirty 
minutes. Departure in thirty 
minutes.” 

Copffe cursed. “This is 
madness. Surely we can spend 
more time on the fifth? I’ve never 
seen such a strong line of 
potassium. Damn it — he’s rushing 
us from cake to cake and we 
have to gobble what cherries we 
can in passing. Jonny, I don’t 
care what he does— by fair means 
or foul we’re going to spend 

GALAXY 


longer at the next one. It’s ludi- 
crous to have months of sleep, 
only to be rushed off our feet 
to exhaustion trying to get 
everything in the twenty or so 
hours he’s giving us — ” 

Sun #37. 

“There is an unreality oc- 
casioned by the drugged un- 
consciousness that is a serious 
threat to mental balance,” Copffe 
declared loudly. “No one ever 
before has been subjected to such 
rapid repetition of metabolic 
suspension. I’m just tired, Cap- 
tain — tired! What is it — six years 
of ‘rest’ we’ve had? But we’ve 
had very little real sleep.” 

Copffe did look haggard. The 
others present also bore marks 
that could have stemmed from 
tension and fatigue. 

“I close my sack and my mind 
is turbulent,” Copffe went on. 
“When I come to again my mind 
is still turbulent. All that streams 
through my brain is the memory 
of the two or three hundred hours 
we have actually experienced. The 
craft seems the same but the 
system has changed. Happening 
once, this is something a man 
can orient to. But hurry, hurry, 
hurry, five successive changes un- 
der the forced demand of extraor- 
dinary conditions — no. Captain, in 
no way can you maintain such a 
pace. Such broken continuity is 
an invitation to trauma.” 

Lemac eyed him. 

STARHUNGER 


“Yes.” 

He glanced again at the prelim- 
inary report from Copffe’s as- 
trolab. Nothing. Fourth planet 
out, three moons, retrograde spin, 
1.1 G, and promising — obscuring 
clouds — ammonia. Imagine that! 
Hell, hell and hell. Ammonia 
again. Why, why? 

“You’re right. We have been 
pushing too hard. I had my 
reasons. Two or three months of 
idling through a system — ” Lemac 
grinned lopsidedly — “eats into 
you, too. It’s like grow-small 
juice — you can feel yourself get- 
ting tinier and tinier. I thought 
busy rush might beat it, but — ” 
he held up the report; it 
shivered — “I’ve got the shakes.” 
Copffe looked and felt relieved. 
“Then we can relax for a while? 
a month, say?” 

“Two weeks,” Lemac thought- 
fully answered, “should be plen- 
ty.” 

“If we can spend years un- 
conscious, surely we can afford 
a month or two on our feet? What 
difference can it make? We’d be 
well overdue even if we started 
for home this minute. Doubtless 
we are already presumed lost and 
the anguish of our disappearance 
will have subsided by now to a 
dull ache. A few hundred hours 
here or there, Captain, at this 
juncture what does it matter?” 
Lemac ignored the biting tone. 
“Despite all indications to the 
contrary, I do have the general 

55 


welfare of those on board to 
heart.” He grinned as though he 
had a pain. “I’ve been in 
spacework for thirty — now getting 
on to forty — foreshortened years. 
I’m not yet inured to space. Space 
scares me sick — did you know 
that? There’s so much of it and 
it seems to get more all the time. 
The only way to shrink it is with 
people.” At once he looked 
weighted. “It’s an inverted 
claustrophobia that makes a man 
want to run back to Earth, the 
only door he has. We need people. 
Out here we need people.” 

And for a moment Copffe 
glimpsed the despairing and 
desperate sincerity of the man. 

Y anine doil was the vessel’s 
Resources Officer. She was con- 
cerned for the depression that 
mantled Lemac. 

“You made a mistake, agreeing 
to spell so long here, Jass. You 
had to pick just about the worst 
set of orbiters we’ve ever come 
across.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Lemac 
said. “Copffe was right — we need 
to get our breath back. Poor 
throbnob. I’ve really put the 
pressure on him. He just can’t 
resist trying to cram in as much 
work as he can.” 

“He certainly gets absorbed in 
his subject. The surface of the 
third is half molten — did you 
know that? Very uninviting. But 
he seems to find it fascinating.” 

56 


“Uhuh. We’re each stuck with 
our own personal curse. His is 
curiosity. I bet he’s been pulling 
things to pieces ever since he 
swallowed the ballbearings from 
his rattle.” 

Yanine appreciated Lemac’s 
effort to be cheerful. 

“I feel sorry for him,” she said. 
“But then I always do feel sorry 
for scientists. They dissect and 
analyze the parts so much that 
they seem to lose the sense and 
meaning of the whole. And the 
worst crime you can commit is 
to deprive them of their subject 
matter.” 

“Yes. He’ll have my blood 
when we get home again.” Very 
soberly he said, “Yan, I am filled 
with foreboding. We have but 
three more calls, right? Before we 
shall be forced to return? Three. 
It seems very few left. I was 
willing to delay here partly to 
put off what I am coming very 
much to fear. Five we have 
visited, thirty-one that others have 
visited.” He covered his eyes with 
his hand. “&Iaybe Rayner was 
lucky. Maybe Poisthed — the next 
mission — is out. Maybe others 
have been sent. I sometimes won- 
der. I know what must be so. 
But the combinations of un- 
favorable elements seem limitless 
and it’s hard to keep faith. And 
at times I can’t help thinking what 
a damn great fool I am.” 

“We need fools, Jass,” she said 
softly. “Big bold bad idiots to 

GALAXY 


buck the odds and take matters 
into their own hands. Come, one 
way or another we’ll succeed. If 
nothing else you’ll become famous 
as the first man to take eight 
suns in a row — and surely, Mr. 
Christian, that will be an inspira- 
tion to the future?” 

«VV aving at last been given some 

H time to think, it is my con- 
clusion that we must display what 
philosophical acceptance that we 
can muster.” Copffe addressed his 
aides, Melda Jonson and Dennis 
Shalpin. “A definite limit has been 
set upon the number of further 
calls we are to make and, barring 
accidents, we have the captain’s 
positive assurance that we shall 
return home. As you know, Cap- 
tain Lemac puzzles me. He ap- 
pears to be genuinely indifferent 
toward the consequences to 
himself of his actions, seems fully 
aware that his motivations are 
akin to a gambler’s hope in slim 
chance— and he blithely concedes 
that his high-handed impositions 
are an unpardonable infringement 
of our rights. Yet in contrast to 
this he quite evidently is an in- 
telligent man and is not sensible 
to our feelings. It is my opinion 
that he will keep his word. Be- 
tween now and when we get home 
we’ll just have to make the best 
of things.” 

And what will be the approx- 
imate E.T. when we get back?” 
“The total elapsed time will be 

STARHUNGER *■ 


around twelve years. I’m sorry, 
Dennis. I have advised him of 
your matrimonial intentions. I’m 
afraid he was not greatly moved.” 
Shalpin shrugged. “Oh, we’re 
too late already. It doesn’t mat- 
ter.” Disgusted, he tossed an in- 
visible ball. “Be philosophical, 
you said. She has probably married 
someone else by now. Hah! She'll 
be thirty by the time I get back. 
It doesn’t matter.” 

For him this was quite a speech 
and demonstration. 

“What if he does find a world?” 
Melda said. “Will he land on it? 
Isn’t there a chance that he won’t 
want to leave?” 

“What? Settle, you mean? My 
goodness, no.” 

“I just thought,” she mused, 
“he wouldn’t have to go back then 
and face the brass section.” 

“Ah. That is a thought. For 
us to become four new Adams 
with two Eves, you think? That’s 
if the place is not occupied 
already with Amazons and he- 
men, eh? No, I think not. On 
the faint chance that we should 
ever encounter such a spot, the 
fulfillment of his ambition would 
be to carry the message back to 
Earth. The event would be a vin- 
dication of his actions I suppose, 
wouldn't it? Hoo, no,” he shook 
his head, “as I see it, either way 
his incentive will be to return.” 

Sun #38. 

Lemac studied the close-ups 

57 


that Radsdasti had sent in from 
Outside. Radsdasti himself stood 
at his elbow, still suited up. 
“You’re sure you could find no 
clues from the deflector?” 

“Not a thing,” Radsdasti said. 
“Checked out in here okay?” 

“Yes.” Lemac scratched his 
chin. “It certainly looks like a 
graze from a frontal strike, the 
way it starts at nothing and cuts 
deeper and deeper till it rips out 
the port tail housing. But there’s 
the nacelle bulge here — how did 
it get by that?” He cogitated. “It 
could be a hit from behind, except 
that the tear says it isn’t and 
at our speed — On the other hand, 
if the deflector was malfunc- 
tioning we’d be like a girls college 
by now.” He quizzed Radsdasti. 
“What does that leave us?” 

“I hate to think — it gives me 
the shudders,” Radsdasti said 
seriously. “It had to be something 
coming in at an acute angle to 
dodge the deflector. Which means 
near broadside. Which means it 
was traveling just a shade slower 
than us. Which means its nose 
reached us, touched us, gouged 
a chunk out of us in a fraction 
of a nanna. Hellish fast. It s not 
natural. I sweat just to think of 
a difference of one k.p.h.” 

“Your diagnosis might be 
wrong. Whatever, I think it s a 
freak" We’ll go through everything 
again. Tail section didn’t look so 
bad — did you see anything I 
didn’t?” 

58 


“No. Luckily just the casing. 

Be okay as long as we stay clear 
of atmosphere.” 

“You don’t tell me? Okay, get 
the patch kit and get out there 
again. We’ll take it from the top 
and microscan the skin all ways 
around from the first sizzle 
mark.” 

“Captain, wouldn’t it be ad- 
visable to go home for repairs? 
Copffe asked. “While you are able 
in a general way to satisfy yourself 
as to the craft’s condition, shock 
waves from such a blow could 
have caused structural flex and 
material alteration in concealed 
areas of the fabric. Already this 
craft has undergone more wear 
and tear than any other of its 
kind. The brevity of our ex- 
perience we know is an illusion. 
This vessel has been working hard 
for a number of years.” 

“Yes. Well you know we go 
over everything from A to zeep 
and back, beginning and end and 
halfway through the flight for tur- 
nover. So far nothing drastic 
enough has arisen to warrant 
return for major overhaul. This 
nick we’ve had is hair-curling but 
not particularly disabling. I don t 
think that our disintegration is 
imminent but if the ship falls 
apart I’ll let you know. 

“Thank you,” Copffe rasped. 

“Welcome.” 

Next time, Copffe thought ir- 
ritably, he’d make sure to .get a 
more docile and respectful cap- 

0ALAXY 


tain. But perhaps not. Out There 
the utmost competence and in- 
tegrity were required — and these 
attributes accorded ill with sub- 
missiveness. No, they made for 
a breed of obstinate, intractable, 
assertive men pig-headed enough 
to chase a fanciful belief to the 
extent of hijacking their craft from 
its designed pursuit. 

Damn! It was annoying. 

«W HAT s t * le use > Yan, what’s 

»T the use?” Lemac despaired 
aloud. “Look at it. Close on sixty 
planets we’ve accounted for alto- 
gether and over ninety per cent 
have been ruled out. We’re left 
with a small handful of potential 
possibles — but what are our 
chances, huh? Really, what are 
our chances? Look at them. Two 
overweight giants monopolizing 
the entire bracket.” 

“The bigger the sun, the bigger 
its planets,” she quoted. She pull- 
ed a face. “It seems to hold true, 
doesn’t it?” 

Radsdasti said, “This will take 
the last of our reserve stricon 
callers, Jass, remember? I was 
thinking, instead of trying to mock 
up a couple more for the next 
two. Why don’t we put out the 
rescue bleeters? They’re not likely 
to be much good to us now, are 
they? And three linked with 
modified signal — they’d serve just 
as well.” 

Lemac thought it over. “True,” 

STARHUNGER 


he assented. “To think of ever 
being rescued out here is 
laughable. The bleeters are just 
a psychological sop — sure go 
ahead and use them.” He sounded 
a wee testy. “You think we’ll need 
two more, huh? It’s just a case 
of making two more calls and 
going home now, itsn’t it? You 
don’t think we’ll find anything, 
do you?” 

“We hope so, Jass,” Yanine 
said. “Nobody knows. The next 
one could — ” 

“Yes, but you don’t believe it, 
do you? Not any more.” 

“No, Jass, it’s not like that. 
Logically there must be other 
worlds resembling ours — but with 
so many stars — ” 

“Yes. The odds don’t improve, 
do they? You’ve come to an- 
ticipate defeat.” 

“Jass — ” 

“No. I believe in fairies, okay? 

I think it’s important that 
somebody does. Setback after set- 
back takes the heart out of people. 
It takes the heart out of me. I 
begin to feel like the pretentious 
high priest of a nut cult.” 

Oh, no, Jass,” Yanine laughed. 
“You’re not that. Eventually we’ll 
strike lucky, you'll see.” 

“Next time? It’s always next 
time. But what about a show of 
confidence, huh? Make up just 
one marker. Our next call just 
has to have what we’re looking 
for, right? Let’s at least outwardly 
show some measure of faith in 

59 


our convictions. If we are fooling 
ourselves, let’s at least do it with 
the crazy enthusiasm that it war- 
rants. This creeping sense of 
futility scrogs me. If you honestly 
think there is no point in probing 
further, then we might as well 
pack up and go home now.” 

“One of the next two,” 
Radsdasti said. “We’ve got to go 
on now. If we don’t, later on 
for sure someone else will and 
there it’ll be. And wouldn’t we 
ever kick ourselves all over the 
place!” 

Lemac rustled up a smile. “All 
right, so be it.” A reaffirmation 
of absolute solidarity. The mu- 
tineers, despite grave premoni- 
tions, courageously electing to 
implement their original plan. 
Play it out; the last throw could be 
the winner. If the neck was stuck 
out far enough, the chopper could 
miss the feet. “Get on to Copffe 
and make his day — tell him it’s 
twenty hours long and he’s only 
got five left.” 

Uf* aptain, this racing is so un- 

t necessary,” Copffe complain- 
ed. “Very well, you wish to visit as 
many as possible, but that is no 
reason to curtail stopovers to 
such ridiculously short periods. 
The scientific implications held 
by the formations of these systems 
may have little significance to 
you, but are of considerable in- 
terest to us.” Copffe was plaintive 
and irascible by turns. “We want 

60 


more time, and we must have 
more time. It is not as if haste 
alone will bring you reward — if 
what you seek is there, then • it 
will have been there for some 
while, and it won’t gallop away 
just because you’re coming.” 

Lemac tried to think up a 
counter to Copfee’s argument, but 
suddenly felt weak. Go, Lemac 
wanted to go. 

“You have let this thing get 
too strong a grip on you, Captain,” 
Copfee charged, “And you know 
it. You’re not walking, or even 
steadily jogging — you’re running. 
Our nerves are frayed, Captain, 
and I suspect and know that you 
are under greater strain than 
you pretend. In your own interests 
halt, please, rest, and let us have 
some leisure to at least catch up 
on our backlog and improve on 
our rudimentary observations 
here.” 

A scientist was not horrified 
by a huge black people-eating 
spider. No. A scientist counted 
its teeth and noted their length, 
measured the density per square 
centimenter of the hair under its 
chin, was intrigued by the 
mechanism of the joints in its 
claws. And a scientist was unin- 
timidated in the spider’s stomach, 
could delight in analyzing its 
digestive juices, could find pur- 
pose in calculating its daily intake 
of calories, could marvel at the 
quality of the enzymes dissolving 
his legs. Copffee did not un- 

GALAXY 


derstand — but Lemac had to un- 
derstand Copffe. 

“Okay, Mr. Copffe. We’ll hang 
out here for another two weeks,” 
Lemac finally consented. “No 
maneuvering. We’ll sit in the great 
fat belly and — rest.” 

Having won the concession, 
Copffe did not particularly heed 
the strangeness of Lemac’s remark. 

R est. Too much time for think- 
ing. Two weeks was ample for 
Lemac to convince himself that 
he was a triplicated over and over 
again fathead. What hope? And 
Outside. How could so much 
emptiness press so physically to 
make him labor? 

Over at last. Tempted to go 
home. Tempted, honestly tempted. 
Foolishness. Welcome home, fool. 
Who would care? 

General Wolfe took Quebec by 
sneaking in over the Heights of 
Abraham. Success equates with 
brilliance. Had Wolfe failed he 
would have been castigated for 
his folly in attempting to take 
troops over such known impossi- 
ble terrain. Crass imbecile. And 
take Benedict Arnold. No, you 
take Bendict Arnold. Traitor. But 
had his scheme succeeded, what? 
The nation’s finest patriot. Suc- 
cess made all the difference. 

Thirty-eight suns. Now on to 
thirty-nine — Lemac’s seventh. The 
seventh sun of a second son. No, 
it would be his ninth. But seventh 
this trip. Seventh! It was mad. 

STARHUNGER 


Three months. It seemed like a 
good idea at the time. But they 
hadn’t even come close. Eight 
suns. He would be proclaimed an 
adventurer. He would go down 
in history. Wild renegade? Hero? 
Funny how adventures did not 
seem very adventurous when a 
man was having them. This ex- 
ploit was driven by fear. The guts 
crawled and there was a growing 
urge to panic, to go faster, to 
look, to go on and on. It had 
to be there, it had to. 

Eight suns? What would be the 
good of that? Praise be, return 
from the dead — with knowledge 
of the dead? An accomplishment . 
to rejoice, a return trailing the 
necropolis of the stars? Perhaps 
humans would overcome obstacles 
in some other manner — the hard, 
hard way. Somehow people would 
have to get Out There. 

Lemac shivered. Blast Copffe. 

Sun #39. 

"Captain, there is one major 
flaw in your self-propelled quest 
for a comparatively Earth-type 
planet.” Copffe stuck finger and 
thumb into his eyes, rubbed, 
blinked, took his time. “You have 
to rely upon us to inform you 
if we do indeed note a body with 
such similarities. Under the cir- 
cumstances, I can see no reason 
why we should be so helpful. We 
can supply you with what in- 
formation we wish and you will 
be none the wiser. Correct?” 

61 


Lemac squinted. “You have 
discovered something?” 

“I didn’t say that. But we could 
have — on the last call but one — or 
three — or four. You are forced 
to trust us, aren't you? And so, 
from the beginning it has been 
in our power to foredoom your 
hopes and ambitions.” 

“Such withholding would glad- 
den your heart?” Lemac’s sharp 
scrutiny met cool response. 
“You're not that kind of man. 
.God, such meanness would be 
unforgivable.” 

“Really? There are some who 
might well regard your behavior 
as unforgivable. Yes, captain, I 
can think of many reasons for 
denying you the pleasure, not least 
of which might be that upon our 
return I would know and you 
would not. And doubtless some 
arrangement could be devised to 
insure that 1 and my assistants 
should receive all of what credit 
might accrue. Why should we help 
you, Captain? What have you 
done for us?” 

Lemac inclined his head. “Why 
tell me this?” He nodded. “Okay. 
Mr. Copffe, I am not after glory. 
If the world is there, you couldn’t 
resist finding it — and if you want 
to keep it to yourself till you 
can use it to make you famous, 
that’s all right by me. I don’t 
have to see it, or even know where 
you found it. It would be suffi- 
cient for me just to know that 
its presence had come at last to 

62 


human knowledge.” He added the 
shrewd question, “And has it?” 

Copffe frowned, but he was no 
poker player and he could not 
maintain his bluff. 

“Yes,” he confessed. He fought 
hard to make his smile grudging 
but it came on full beam. “Come 
down and see for yourself. The 
fourth one. Captain — ” Helplessly 
he waved his hand. He gave up 
and let himself go. “It’s beautiful, 
absolutely beautiful. Smaller than 
Earth, not much, though, gravity 
pointing but with a seeming more 
equal land-sea ratio. Oxygen 
could be as high as twenty-five 
per cent, though surface pressure 
might not be much above point 
eight kilograms. Beautifully posi- 
tioned, beautiful. It’s an incredible 
sight from here. Captain — veiled, 
blue and green. It is absolutely 
astonishing. You must see 
it — come, come.” 

Once he had released it, Copffe 
could not stop his tongue from 
running away. He urged Lemac 
from his table. 

“These views give only very 
rough estimates, of course. We’ll 
have to move in a lot closer to re- 
fine our resolutions but you won’t 
object to that, eh? Marvelous. 
Fantastic. It has a moon, too. It 
really does, Captain — wait till you 
see. No emissions that might be 
construed as being intelligence- 
inspired — but this, of course, pro- 
ves nothing.” 

Copffe fed the way. “There’s 

GALAXY 


life there without doubt, rich life. 
Astonishing. Scarcely any inclina- 
tion at all. Provisionally have it 
down for a twenty-six-hour cycle 
but that’s loose, of course. A 
splendid sight. Curiously, it lies 
ten degrees from the general plane 
but its ellipse is not too great, I 
should say. A few days will soon 
determine that with accuracy. 
Surface temperatures — ” 

Lemac followed him as he bab- 
bled on. Lemac was dryly amused 


by the scientist’s unscientific 
emotion — it seemed to prove 
something. For himself, Lemac 
was surprised most by his own 
overcoming feeling of detachment. 
They had found a world. He knew 
a sense of anticlimax. They had 
found a world. Of course they 
had. He'd known they would. It 
had been waiting there. It had 
only had to be found, that was 
all. So Simple, really.

EFFECT 


by A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 

The human equation as worked out by the 
Department of Socio-Economic Science re- 
quired a sinister correction by The Subtracter. 




L ieutenant John Grimes, of 
the Interstellar Federation’s 
Survey Service, was proud of his 
first command. She was only a 
little ship, a Serpent Class courier, 
lightly armed and manned by a 
minimal crew. In addition to 
Grimes there were two watch- 
keeping officers, both ensigns, an 


engineering officer — another one- 
ringer. Also two communications 
officers, lieutenants both, one in 
charge of the vessel’s electronic 
equipment, the other a psionic 
radio officer, this being in the 
days before the development of 
the Carlotti Communications 
System. There were no petty of- 


64 


ficers and no ratings. There were, 
however,, -the various occasional 
passengers — one function of the 
couriers was to get V.I.P.s from 
Point A to Point 3 in a hurry, 
as and when required. 

“You will proceed,” Com- 
modore Damien had told him, 
“from Lindisfarne Base to Don- 
caster at maximum speed — but 
considering at all times the safety 
of your vessel.” 

“And also the comfort of my 
passenger, sir?” asked Grimes. 

“That need not concern you, 
Lieutenant.” Damien grinned, his 
teeth yellow in his skull-like face. 
“Mr. Alberto is tough. Tougher, 
I would say, than the average 
spaceman.” 

Grimes’ prominent ears flushed. 
The commodore had managed to 
imply that Grimes was below 
average. “Very well, sir,” he said. 
“I’ll pile on the Gs and the lyps.” 

“Just so you arrive in one 
piece,” growled Damien. “That’s 
all our lords and masters ask of 
you. Or, to be more exact, just 
so Mr. Alberto arrives in one 
piece and functioning.” He lifted 
a heavily sealed envelope off his 
desk, handed it to Grimes. “Your 
orders, to be opened when you 
are on trajectory. But I’ve already 
told you most of it*” He grinned 
again. “On your bicycle, space- 
man.” 

Grimes rose to his feet, came 
stiffly to attention, saluted, turned 
smartly about and marched out 

THE MINUS EFFECT 


of the commodore’s office. This 
was his first sealed-orders assign- 
ment. 

Clear of the office, Grimes 
continued his march, striding in 
time to martial music audible only 
to himself. Then he paused, look- 
ing toward the docking area of 
the spaceport. There was his ship, 
already positioned on the pad, 
dwarfed by a huge Constellation 
Class cruiser to one side of her, 
a Planet Class transport to 
the other. But she stood there 
bravely enough on the apron, a 
metal spire so slender as to appear 
taller than she actually was, 
gleaming brightly in the almost 
level rays of the westering sun. 
And she was his. It did not matter 
that officers serving in larger 
vessels referred to the couriers as 
flying darning needles. 

So he strode briskly to the ramp 
extruded from the after airlock 
of his flying darning needle, his 
stocky body erect and dignified in 
his smart — but not too osten- 
taciously smart — uniform. Ensign 
Beadle, his first lieutenant, was 
there to greet hint. The young man 
threw him a smart salute. Grimes 
returned it with just the right 
degree of sloppiness. 

“All secure for lift-off. Cap- 
tain.” 

“Thank you. Is the passenger 
aboard?” 

“Yes, sir. And his baggage.” 

Grimes fought down the rising 
temptation to ask what he was 


65 


like. Only when one is really 
senior can one unbend with one’s 
juniors. 

“Very well. Number One.” He 
looked at his watch. “My lift-off 
is scheduled for nineteen-thirty 
hours. It is now nineteen- 
seventeen. I shall go straight to 
control, Mr. Beadle.” 

' “Mr. von Tannenbaum and Mr. 
Slovotny are waiting for you there, 
sir, and Mr. McCloud is standing 
by in the engine room.” 

“Good. And Mr. Deane is 
tucked safely away with his poo- 
dle’s brain in aspic?” 

“He is, sir.” 

“Good. Then give Mr. Alberto 
my compliments and ask him if 
he would like to join us in control 
during lift-off.” 

Grimes negotiated the ladder in 
the axial shaft rapidly, without 
losing breath. The Serpent Class 
couriers were too small to run 
to an elevator. He did not make 
a stop at his own quarters. A 
courier captain was supposed to 
be able to proceed anywhere in 
the Galaxy, known or unknown, 
at a second’s notice. In the control 
room he found Ensign Tannen- 
baum — Blond Beast — and Lieu- 
tenant Slovotny — Sparks — at their 
stations. He buckled himself into 
his own chair. He had just finish- 
ed doing so when the plump, 
lugubrious Beadle pulled himself 
up through the hatch. He ad- 
dressed Grimes. 

“I asked Mr. Alberto if he’d 


like to come up to the office, 
Captain.” 

Grimes looked pointedly at the 
clock on the bulkhead. 

“And is he coming up?” 

“No, Captain. He said — ” 

“Out with it, man. It’s time 
we were getting up them stairs.” 
“He said, ‘You people look af- 
ter your job and I’ll look after 
mine.’ ” 

Grimes shrugged. As a courier 
captain he had learned to take 
V.I.P.s as they came. Some — a 
very few of them — he would have 
preferred to have left. 

He asked, “Are Mr. Alberto 
and Mr. Deane secured for lift- 
off?” 

“Indeed they are. Captain, 
although Spooky’s not happy 
about the shockproof mount he 
has for his amplifier.” 

“He never is really satisfied. 
Clearance, Sparks.” 

“Clearance, Captain.” The wiry 
little radio officer spoke quietly 
into his microphone. “Mission 
7DKY to Tower. Come in. Re- 
quest clearance.” 

“Tower to Mission 7DKY. You 
have clearance. Bon voyage.” 
“Thank him,” said Grimes. He 
glanced rapidly around the little 
control room. All officers Were 
strapped in their acceleration 
chairs. All tell-tale lights were 
green. “All systems go,” he mut- 
tered. 

He pushed the right buttons and 
went. 


66 


GALAXY 


I t was a normal enough courier 
lift-off. The ship’s inertial drive 
easily developed maximum thrust 
within microseconds of being 
started. Once his radar told him 
that the ship was the minimum 
safe altitude above the port Grimes 
cut in his auxiliary rockets. The 
craft was built to take stresses 
that, in larger vessels, would have 
been dangerous. Her personnel 
prided themselves on their 
toughness. 

As did the one outsider, the 
passenger. Grimes would have 
grinned had it not been for the 
acceleration’s flattening out of his 
features. Commodore Damien has 
said that Mr. Alberto was 
tough — so Mr. Alberto would just 
have to take the Gs and like it. 

The ship drove up through the 
last, high wisps of cirrus into the 
darkling, purple sky, toward the 
sharply bright, unwinking stars. 
She plunged outward through the 
last tenuous shreds of atmosphere 
and the needles of instruments 
flickered briefly as she passed 
through the Van Allens. She was 
out and clear now — out and 
clear — and Grimes cut both iner- 
tial and reaction drives, used his 
gyroscopes to swing the sharp 
prow of the ship on to the target 
star, the Doncaster sun. 

He brought that far distant 
speck of luminosity into the exact 
center of his spiderweb sights. 
Von Tannebaum, who was 
navigator, gave him the correc- 

THE MINUS EFFECT 


tions necessitated by galactic 
drift — it was essential to aim the 
vessel at where the star was now, 
not where it was some seventy- 
three years ago. 

The inertial drive was restarted 
and the ever-precessing rotors of 
the Mannschen drive were then set 
in motion. There was the usual 
brief queasiness induced by the 
temporal precession field, the 
usual visual shock as colors sag- 
ged down the spectrum, as the 
hard, bright stars outside the 
viewports became hazy, iridescent 
nebulosities. Grimes remained in 
his chair for a few minutes, satis- 
fying himself that all was as it 
should be. Slowly and carefully 
he filled and lit his foul pipe, 
ignoring a dirty look from Beadle 
who, in the absence of a 
biochemist, was responsible for 
the ship’s air-regeneration system. 

Then, speaking through a swirl 
of acrid smoke, he ordered, “Set 
deep-space watches, Number One. 
And tell Mr. Deane to report to 
Lindisfarne Base that we are on 
trajectory for Doncaster.” 

“E.T.A. Doncaster, Captain?” 
asked Beadle. 

Grimes pulled the sealed en- 
velope from the pouch at the side 
of his chair, looked at it. 

For eyes only. Destroy by fire 
after reading. 

He said, “I’ll let you know after 
I’ve skimmed through this hi'.mf.” 

After all, even in a small ship 
informality can be allowed to go 


67 


only so far. He unbuckled himself, 
rose from his seat, went down 
to his quarters to read the orders. 

T here was little in them that he 
had not already been told by 
Commodore Damien. Insofar as 
the E.T.A. was concerned, this 
was left largely to his own dis- 
cretion, although it was stressed 
that the courier was to arrive at 
Doncaster not later than April 
twenty-third. Local Date. And 
how did the Doncastrian calendar 
tally with that used on Lindisfarne? 
Grimes, knowing that Blond Beast 
was now on watch, called control 
and threw the question onto von 
Tannenbaum’s place, knowing 
that within a very short time he 
would have an answer accurate 
to at least fourteen places of de- 
cimals— and that as soon as he. 
Grimes, made a decision regarding 
the time of arrival the necessary 
adjustment of velocity would be 
put in hand without delay. 

Von Tannenbaum called back. 
“April twenty-third on Don- 
caster coincides with November 
eighth on Lindisfarne. I can give 
you the exact correlation, Cap- 
tain.” 

“Don’t bother, pilot. My orders 
allow me quite a bit of leeway. 
Suppose we get Mr. Alberto to 
his destination just three days 
before the deadline — give him 
time to settle in before he com- 
mences his duties, whatever they 
are, in the high commissioner’s 

68 


office. As far as I can gather, 
we’re supposed to stay on Don- 
caster until directed elsewhere — 
so an extra three days in port will 
do us no harm.” 

“It's a pleasant planet, I’ve 
heard, Captain.” A pause ensued 
and Grimes could imagine the 
burly, flaxen-headed young man 
running problems through the 
control-room computer, checking 
the results with his own slipstick. 
“This calls for a reduction of 
speed. Shall I do it by cutting 
down the temporal precession rate 
or by reducing acceleration?” 

“Two Gs is a little heavy,” ad- 
mitted Grimes. 

“Very well, Captain. Reduce 
to one-point-two-seven?” 

“That will balance?” 

“It will balance.” 

“Then make it so.” 

Almost immediately the ir- 
regular throbbing of the inertial 
drive slowed. Grimes felt his 
weight pressing less heavily into 
the padding of his chair. He did 
not need to glance at the ac- 
celerometer mounted among the 
other flight instruments on the 
bulkhead of his cabin. Von Tan- 
nenbaum was a good man, a good 
officer, a good navigator. 

A sharp rap came on the door. 

“Come in,” called Grimes, 
swiveling his seat so that he faced 
the visitor. This, he realized, 
would be his passenger, anticipat- 
ing the captain’s invitation to an 
introductory drink and talk. 

GALAXY 







He was not a big man, this 
Mr. Alberto, and at first he gave 
an impression of plumpness, of 
softness. But it was obvious from 
the way that he moved that his 
bulk was solid muscle, not fat. 
He was clad in the dark gray 
that was almost a civil service 
uniform — and even Grimes, who 
knew little of the niceties of 
civilian tailoring, could see that 
both the material and the cut of 
Alberto's suit were superb. He 
had a broad but ordinary face. His 
hair was black and glossy, his 
eyes black and rather dull. His 
expression was petulant. 

He demanded rather than ask- 
ed, “Why have we slowed down?” 

Grimes bit back a sharp retort. 
After all, he was only a junior 
officer in spite of his command. 
His passenger probably piled on 
far more Gs than a mere lieu- 
tenant. 

“I have adjusted to a com- 
fortable actual velocity, Mr. 
Alberto, so as to arrive three days, 
local, before the deadline. I trust 
that this suits your plans.” 

“Three days — ” Angelo smiled 
and his face was transformed 
abruptly from that of a sulky baby 
to that of a contented child. It 
was. Grimes realized, no more 
than a deliberate turning on of 
charm — but, he admitted to 
himself, it was effective. “Three 
days will give me ample time to 
settle down, Captain, before I 
start work. And I know, as well 

THE MINUS EFFECT 


as you do, that overly heavy ac- 
celeration can be tiring.” 

“Won’t you sit down. Mr. 
Alberto? A drink, perhaps?” 
“Thank you. Captain. A dry 
sherry, if I may.” 

Grimes grinned apologetically. 
“I’m afraid that these Couriers 
haven’t much of a cellar. I can 
offer you gin, scotch or brandy.” 
“A gin and lime, then.” 

The lieutenant busied himself 
at his little bar, mixed the drinks, 
gave Alberto his glass, raised his. 
“Here’s to crime” 

Alberto smiled again. “Why do 
you toast crime, Captain?” 

“A current custom in the Ser- 
vice. No so long ago it was, 
‘Down the hatch’ Before that it 
was, ‘Here’s mud in yer eye.’ 
We've been dipping into history 
for our tradition.” 

“I see.” Alberto sipped appre- 
ciatively. “Good gin, this.” 

“Not bad. We get it from Van 
Diemen’s Planet.” He waited 
through a brief silence. Then: 
“Will you be long on Doncaster, 
Mr. Alberto? I rather gained the 
impression that we’re supposed to 
wait there until you’ve finished 
your — business.” 

“It shouldn’t take long.” 
“Diplomatic?” 

“You could call it that.” 

Again the smile. Why did the 
white teeth look so carnivorous? 
“Another drink?” 

“Why, yes. I like to relax when 
I can.” 


69 


“Yours is demanding work?” 
“And so is yours, Captain.” 

The brassy music of a bugle 
drifted into the cabin through the 
intercom. 

“Mess call,” said Grimes* 

“You do things in style, 
Captain.” 

Grimes shrugged. “We have a 
tape for all the calls in general 
use. As for the tucker — ” He 
shrugged again. “We don’t run 
to a cook in a ship of this class. 
Sparks — Mr. Slovotny — prepares 
the meals in space. As a chef 
he’s a good radio officer.” 

“Do you think he’d mind if 
I took over?” asked Alberto. 
“After all, I’m the only idler 
aboard this vessel.” 

“We’ll think about it,” said 
Grimes. 

ou KNOW what I think, Cap- 
I tain?” Beadle asked. 

“I’m not a telepath, Number 
One,” said Grimes. “Tell me.” 

The two men were sitting at 
ease in the Courier’s control 
room. Each of them was con- 
scious of a certain tightness in 
the waistband of his uniform 
shorts. Grimes was suppressing a 
tendency to burp gently. Alberto, 
once he had been given a free 
hand in the galley, had speedily 
changed shipboard eating from a 
necessity to a real pleasure. He 
insisted that somebody else always 
do the washing up, but this was 
a small price to pay. This evening, 

70 


for example, the officers had eat- 
ten saltimbocca, accompanied 
by a rehydrated rough red that 
the amateur chef had contrived, 
somehow, to make taste like real 
wine. Nonetheless, he had humbly 
apologized for the meal. 

I should have used prosciutto, 
not any old ham. And fresh sage 
leaves, not dried sage. 

“I think,” said Beadle, “that 
the standard of the high com- 
missioner’s entertaining has been 
lousy. Alberto must be a cordon 
bleu chef, sent out to Doncaster 
to play merry hell in the kitchen.” 

“Could be,” said Grimes. He 
belched gently. “Could be. But 
I can’t see our lords and masters 
laying on a ship, even a lowly 
Serpent Class Courier, for a cook, 
no matter how talented. As a 
matter of fact, Alberto told me 
that he was a mathematician. .” 

“A real mathematician?” Beadle 
was scornfully incredulous. “You 
know how the Blond Beast loves 
to show off his toys to anybody 
who’ll evince the slightest interest. 
Well, Alberto was up in the con- 
trol room for a while during his 
watch — you’ll recall that he said 
he’d fix the coffee maker. Our 
Mr. von Tannenbaum paraded his 
pets and made them do their 
tricks. He was in a very disgruntl- 
ed mood when he handed over 
to me when I came on. How 
did he put it? ‘I don’t expect a 
very high level of intelligence in 
planetlubbers but that Alberto is 

GALAXY 


in a class by himself. I doubt 
he could add two and two and get 
four twice running.’ ” 

“Did he fix the machinetta?” 
“As a matter of fact, yes. It 
makes beautiful coffee now.” 
“Then what are you com- 
plaining about?” 

“I’m not complaining, Captain. 
I’m just curious.” 

And so am I. 

As the commanding officer of 
the ship Grimes was in a position 
to satisfy his curiosity. After Mr. 
Beadle had gone about his 
multifarious duties Grimes called 
Mr. Deane on the telephone. 

“Are you busy. Spooky?” 

“I’m always busy, Captain.” 
The abrupt reply was authentic 
enough. A Psionic Radio Officer 
was on duty all the time, sleeping 
and waking, his mind open to 
the transmitted thoughts of other 
telepaths throughout the Galaxy. 
Some were powerful transmitters, 
others were not. Some made use, 
as Deane always did, of organic 
amplifiers — others made do with 
the unaided power of tlreir own 
minds. And there was selection, 
of course. Just as a wireless 
operator on Earth’s seas in the 
early days of radio could pick 
out his own ship’s call sign from 
the babble and babel of Morse, 
so the trained telepath could listen 
selectively. At short ranges he 
could, too, receive the thoughts 
of the nontelepaths who were 
about him — but unless somehow 

THE MINUS EFFECT 


the circumstances were excep- 
tional he was supposed to main- 
tain the utmost secrecy regarding 
them. 

“Can you spare me a few 
minutes. Spooky? After all, you 
can maintain your listening watch 
anywhere in the ship.” 

“Oh, all right. Captain. I'll be 
up. I already know what you're 
going to. ask me.” 

You would. 

A minute or so later Mr. Deane 
drifted into Grimes’s day cabin. 
Deane’s nickname was apt. He 
was tall, fragile, so albinoid as 
to appear almost translucent. His 
white face was a featureless blob. 

“Take a pew, Spooky. A 
drink?” 

“Mother’s ruin, Captain.” 
Grimes poured gin for both of 
them. His glass held ice and a 
generous sprinkling of bitters. Mr.' 
Deane preferred his gin straight, 
as colorless as he was himself. 

The Psionic Radio Officer gen- 
teelly sipped. 

Then: “I’m afraid that I can’t 
oblige you, Captain.” 

“Why not, Spooky?” 

“You know very well that we 
graduates of the Rhine Institute 
have to swear to respect privacy.” 
“There’s no privacy aboard a 
ship. Spooky. There cannot be.” 
“There can be, Captain. There 
must be.” 

“Not when the safety of the 
ship is involved.” 

The argument was familiar. 

71 


Grimes knew that after the third 
gin the telepath would weaken. 

“We get odd passengers aboard 
this ship, Spooky. Surely you re- 
member that Waldegren diplomat 
who had the crazy scheme of 
seizing her and turning her over 
to his own navy.” 

“I remember, Captain.” 

Deane extended his glass which, 
suprisingly, was empty. Grimes 
wondered, as he always did, if 
its contents had been teleported 
directly into the officer’s stomach. 
But he poured a refill. 

“Mr. Alberto’s another odd 
passenger,” he went on. 

“But a Federation citizen,” 
Deane told him. 

“How do we know? He could 
be a double agent. Do you know?” 
“I don’t.” After only two gins 
Spooky was ready to spill the 
beans. This was unusual. “I don’t 
know anything.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Usually, Captain, we have to 
shut our minds to the trivial, bor- 
ing thoughts of you psionic 
morons. No offense intended — but 
that’s the way we think of you. 
We get sick of visualizations of 
the girls you met in the last port 
and the girls you hope to meet 
in the next port.” He screwed 
his face up in disgust, made it 
evident that he did, after all, 
possess features. “Bums, bellies 
and breasts. The Blond Beast’s 
a tit man and you have a thing 
about legs.” 

72 


Grimes’s ears reddened but he 
said nothing. 

“And the professional wishful 
thinking is even more nauseating. 
When do I get my half ring? When 
do / get my brass hat? When 
shall I make Admiral?” 
“Ambition.” 

“Ambition, hell. Of late I’ve 
been getting: I wonder what 

Alberto’s putting on for breakfast? 
For lunch? For dinner?” 

“W'hat is he putting on for din- 
ner?” asked Grimes. “I’ve been 
rather wondering if our tissue 
culture chook could be used for 
Chicken Cacciatore.” 

“I don’t know.” 

“No, you’re not a chef. As well 
we know — after the last time that 
you volunteered for galley duties.” 
“I mean, I don’t know what 
the menus will be.” It was Deane s 
turn to blush. “As a matter of 
fact, Captain, I have been trying 
to get previews. I have to watch 
my diet.” 

Grimes tried not to think 
uncharitable thoughts. Like many 
painfully thin people Deane en- 
joyed a voracious appetite. 

He said, “You’ve been merely 
trying to eavesdrop? No luck?” 
“Yes. But there are non- 
telepaths, you know, and Alber- 
to’s one of them. A true non- 
telepath. Most people transmit, 
although they cannot receive. 
Alberto doesn’t transmit.” 

“A useful qualification for a 
diplomat,” said Grimes. “If he 

GALAXY 


is a diplomat. But could he be 
using some sort of psionic jam- 
mer?" 

“No. I’d know if he were.” 
Grimes couldn’t ignore that 
suggestively held empty glass any 
longer. He supposed that Deane 
had earned his third gin. 

T he couier broke through into 
normal Space Time north of the 
plane of Doncaster’s ecliptic. In 
those days, before the Carlotti 
Beacons made FTL position fix- 
ing simple, navigation was an art 
rather than a science — and von 
Tannenbaum was an artist. The 
little ship dropped into a trans- 
polar orbit about the planet and 
then, as soon as permission to 
land had been granted by 
Aerospace Control, descended to 
Port Duncannon. It was. Grimes 
told himself smugly, one of his 
better landings. And so it should 
have been — conditions were little 
short of ideal. There was no 
cloud, no wind, not even any clear 
air turbulence at any level. The 
ship’s instruments were working 
perfectly, and the inertial drive 
was responding to the controls 
with no time lag whatsoever. It 
was one of those occasions on 
which the captain feels that his 
ship is no more — and no 
less — than a beautifully function- 
ing extension of his own body. 
Finally, it was morning, local 
time, with the sun just lifting over 
the verdant, rolling hills to the 

THE MINUS EFFECT 


eastward, bringing out all the col- 
or of the sprawling city a few 
miles from the spaceport, making 
it look from the air like a huge 
handful of gems spilled carelessly 
on a green carpet. 

Grimes set the vessel down in 
the exact center of the triangle 
marked by the blinkers. He 
touched so gently that, until he 
cut the drive, a walnut under the 
vaned landing gear would not 
have been crushed. 

He said quietly, “Finished with 
engines.” 

“Receive boarders, Captain?” 
asked Beadle. 

“Yes, Number One.” 

Grimes looked out through the 
viewport to the ground cars that 
were making their way from the 
administration block. Port health, 
immigration, customs — the har- 
bormaster paying his respects to 
the captain of a visiting Federa- 
tion warship. And the last vehicle? 
He took a pair of binoculars from 
the rack, focused them on the 
flag fluttering from the bonnet of 
the car in the rear. It was dark 
blue, with a pattern of silver stars, 
the Federation’s colors. So the 
high commissioner himself had 
come out to see the ship berth. 
He wished that he and his officers 
had dressed more formally but 
it was too late to do anything 
about it now. He went down to 
his quarters, was barely able to 
change the epaulettes of his shirt, 
for a pair of shining new ones 

73 


before the high commissioner was 
at his door. 

Mr. Beadle ushered in the im- 
portant official with all the cere- 
mony he could muster at short 
notice. 

“Sir, this is the captain, Lieu- 
tenant Grimes. Captain, may l 
now introduce Sir William Wil- 
loughby.” 

Willoughby extended a hand 
that, like the rest of him, was 
plump. 

“Welcome aboard, Captain. 
He laughed. “I hope you don’t 
mind my borrowing an ex- 
pression.” 

“Not at all. Will you sit down, 
Sir William?” 

“Thank you. Captain. But only 
for a couple of minutes. I shall 
be out of your hair as soon as 
Mr. Alberto has been cleared. 
Then I’ll whisk him off to the 
Residence.” He paused, regarding 
Grimes from eyes that, in the sur- 
rounding fat, were sharp and 
bright. “How did you find him, 
Captain?” 

“Mr. Alberto, sir?” What was 
the man getting at? “He’s an ex- 
cellent chef.” 

“Glad to hear you say it. Cap- 
tain. That’s why 1 sent for him.” 

“So he's a chef, sir?” 

Again those sharp little eyes 
bored into Grimes’s skull. 

“Of course. What else did you 
think?” 

“Well, as a matter of fact we 
were yarning one night and he 

74 


sort of hinted that he was a 
mathematician. 

“Did he?”. Then Willoughby 
chuckled. "He was putting you 
on. Although any real chef is a 
mathematician — he must get his 
recipes right.” 

“That's one way of looking at 
it, Sir William.” 

Beadle was back then, followed 
by Alberto. 

“I must be off, now. Captain,” 
said the passenger, shaking hands. 
“Thank you for a very pleasant 
voyage.” 

“Thank you,” Grimes told him, 
adding, “We shall miss you.” 

“But you'll enjoy some more [ 
of his cooking,” the high com- 
missioner said genially. "As of- 
ficers of the only Federation 
warship on this world you 11 have I 
plenty of invitations — to the 
Residence as well as elsewhere. 
Too, if Mr. Alberto manages to 
impart his skills to my permanent 
staff — you may shortly be taking 
him back with you.” 

“We hope so,” Grimes said. 

“Good day to you, then. Come 
on, Mr. Alberto — it’s time you 
started to show my glorified 
scullions how to boil an egg” 

He was gone. Then the har- 
bormaster was at the door. He 
was invited in, took a seat, ac- I 
cepted coffee. 

“Your first visit to Doncaster,” 
he announced rather than asked. 

“Yes, Captain Tarran. It seems 
a very pleasant planet.” 


GALAXY 


The harbormaster made a non- 
committal sound. 

“Tell me, is the cooking at the 
Residence as bad as the high 
commissioner makes out?” 

“I wouldn’t know, Captain. I’m 
just a merchant skipper in a shore 
job. I don’t get asked to all the 
best parties.” The sudden white 
grin in the dark, lean face took 
the rancor out of the words. 
“And f thank all the odd gods 
of the Galaxy for that.” 

“I concur with your sentiments, 
Captain Tarran. One never seems 
to meet any real people at the 
official bun-struggles. It’s all stiff 
collars, best behavior and being 
nice to nongs and drongoes whom 
normally you’d run a mile to 
avoid.” 

“Still,” said Mr. Beadle, “the 
high commissioner seems to have 
the common touch.” 

“How so?” asked Grimes. 
“Well, coming out to the 
spaceport in person to pick up 
his chef.” 

“Cupboard love,” Grimes told 
him. “Cupboard love.” 

T here were official parties and 
there were unofficial ones. Tar- 
ran may not have been a member 
of the planet’s snobocracy but he 
knew people in all walks of life, 
in all trades and professions, and 
the gatherings to which, through 
him. Grimes was invited were far 
more entertaining affairs than the 
official functions he was obliged 

THE MINUS EFFECT 


to attend. It was at an informal 
supper which was given by Pro- 
fessor Tolliver, who held the Chair 
of Political Science at Duncannon 
University, that he met Selma 
Madigan. 

With the exception of Tarran 
and Grimes and his officers all 
the guests were university people, 
students as well as instructors. 
Some w'ere human and some were 
not. Much to his surprise Grimes 
found that he was getting along 
famously with a Shaara princess, 
especially since he had cordially 
detested a Shaara queen to whom 
he had been introduced at a 
reception in the Mayor’s Palace. 

And there l was, having to say 
nice things to a bedraggled, old, 
oversized bumblebee loaded down 
with more precious stones than 
this ship could lift. And with all 
that tonnage of diamonds she 
couldn't afford a decent voice 
box. She sounded like a scratched 
platter and a worn-out needle on 
one of these antique record 
players. 

This Shreen was beautiful. Hers 
was an inhuman beauty, of 
course — that of a glittering, in- 
tricate mobile. By chance or 
design — design, thought Grimes 
— her voice box produced 

a pleasant, almost seductive con- 
tralto, with faintly buzzing under- 
tones. She was an arthropod but 
there could be no doubt about 
the fact that she was an at- 
tractive female. 


.. : J 


75 


She was saying, “I find you 
humans so fascinating, Captain. 
There is so much similarity to be 
discovered between yourselves 
and ourselves — and such great 
differences. But 1 have enjoyed 
my stay on this planet.” 

“And will you be here much 
longer, Your Highness?” 

“Call me Shreen, Captain,” she 
told him. 

“Thank you, Shreen. My name 
is John. 1 shall feel honored if 
you call me that.” He laughed. 
“In any case, my real rank is 
only lieutenant.” 

“Very well, Lieutenant John. 
But to answer your question. I 
fear that I shall return to my 
own world as soon as 1 have 
gained my degree in socio- 
econonomics. Our queen mother 
decided that this will be a useful 
qualification for a future ruler. 
The winds of change blow through 
our hives and we must trim our 
wings to them.” 

And very pretty wings, too. 
But Shreen was impossibly 
alien and the girl who approached 
gracefully over the polished floor 
was indubitably human. She was 
slender and tall for a woman. Her 
gleaming auburn hair was piled 
high in an intricate coronal. Her 
mouth was too wide for conven- 
tional prettiness, the planes of her 
thin face were too well defined. 
Her eyes were definitely green. 
Her smile, as she spoke, made 
her beautiful. 


“Another conquest, Shreen?” 
she asked. 

“I wish it were, Selma,” replied 
the Princess. “1 wish that Lieu- 
tenant John were an arthropod 
like myself.” 

“In that case,” grinned Grimes, 
“I'd be a drone.” 

“From what I can gather,” 
retorted the human girl, “that’s 
all that spaceship captains are 
anyhow.” 

“Have you met Selma?” asked 
Shreen. 

She performed the introduc- 
tions. 

“And are you enjoying the par- 
ty, Mr. Grimes?” inquired Selma 
Madigan. 

“Yes, Miss Madigan. It’s a very 
pleasant change from the usual 
official function. But don’t tell 
anybody I said so.” 

“I’m glad you like us. We try 
to get away from that ghastly out- 
posts-of-empire atmosphere. Quite 
a number of our students are like 
Shreen here, quote aliens un- 
quote.” 

“On my world you would be 
the aliens.” 

“I know, my dear, and I’m sure 
that Mr. Grimes does, too. But 
all intelligent beings can make 
valuable contributions to each 
other. No one race has a sacred 
mission to civilize the Galaxy. .” 

"I wish you wouldn't preach, 
Selma.” It was amazing how much 
expression the princess could get 
out of her mechanical voice box. 


76 


GALAXY 


“If you must, perhaps, you 
can make a convert out. of Lieu- 
tenant John.” Shreen waved a 
gracefully articulated forelimb and 
was away, gliding off to join a 
group composed of two human 
men, a young Hallichek and a 
gaudy pseudosaurian from Dek- 
kovar. 

Selma Madigan looked directly 
at Grimes. 

“And what do you think of 
our policy of integration?” 

“It has to come, I suppose.” 

“It has to come,” she mimick- 
ed. “You brassbound types are 
all the same. You get along fa- 
mously with somebody like 
Shreen, because she’s a real, live 
princess. But the Shaara royalty 
isn’t royalty as we understand it. 
The queens are females who’ve 
reached the egg-laying stage, the 
princesses are females who are 
not yet sexually developed. 
Still — Shreen’s a princess. You 
have far less in common with her, 
biologically speaking, than you 
have with Oona — but you gave 
Oona the brush-off and fawned 
all over Shreen.” 

Grimes flushed. “Oona’s a 
rather smelly and scruffy little 
thing like a Terran chimpanzee. 
Shreen’s — beautiful.” 

“Oona has a brilliant mind. Her 
one weakness is that she thinks 
that Terrans in pretty, gold- 
braided uniforms are wonderful. 
You snubbed her. Shreen noticed. 
I noticed.” 


“As far as I’m concerned,” said 
Grimes, “Oona can be her im- 
perial highness on whatever world 
she comes from— but I don’t have 
to like her.” 

Professor Tolliver, casually clad 
in a rather grubby toga, smoking 
a pipe even fouler than Grimes’s, 
joined the discussion. 

“Young Grimes has a point.” 

“I have,” agreed Grimes. “As 
far as I’m concerned, people are 
people — it doesn’t matter a damn 
if they're humanoid, arachnoid, 
saurian or purple octopi from the 
next galaxy but three. If they’re 
our sort of people — I like ’em. 
If they ain’t — I don’t.” 

“Oona’s our sort of people,” 
insisted Selma. 

“She doesn’t smell like it.” 

The girl laughed. “And how 
do you think she enjoys the stink 
of your pipe — and, come to that, 
Peter’s pipe?” 

“Perhaps she does enjoy it,” 
suggested Grimes. 

“As a matter of fact she does,” 
said Professor Tolliver. 

“Men — ” muttered Selma Mad- 
igan disgustedly. 

Tolliver drifted away. Grimes 
walked with the girl to the table 
on which stood a huge punchbowl. 
He ladled out drinks for each of 
them. He raised his own glass 
in a toast. 

“Here’s to integration” 

“I wish you really meant that.” 
“Perhaps I do,” Grimes mur- 
mured a little doubtfully. “After 


THE MINUS EFFECT 


77 


all, we've only one universe and 
we all have to live in it. It’s 
not so long ago that blacks and 
whites and yellows were at each 
other’s throats on the home 
planet — to say nothing of the 
various subdivisions within each 
color grouping. Von Tannen- 
baum — that’s him over there, the 
Blond Beast we call him — is an 
excellent officer, a first class 
shipmate and a very good friend. 
But his ancestors were very 
unkind to mine, on my mother’s 
side. And mine had quite a long 
record of being unkind to other 
people. I could be wrong — but 
I think that much of Earth’s 
bloody history was no more than 
xenophobia carried to extremes.” 
“Quite a speech, John.” She 
sipped her drink. “It’s a pity that 
the regulations of your service 
forbid you to play any active part 
in politics.” 

“Why?” 

“You’d make a very good 
recruit for the new party we’re 
starting. LL.” 

“LL?” 

“The obvious abbreviation. The 
League of Life. You were talking 
just now of Terran history. Even 
when Earth’s nations were at war 
there were organizations with pan- 
national and pan-racial mem- 
berships. The aim of the League 
of Life is to build up 'a mem- 
bership of all intelligent species.” 
“Quite an undertaking.” 

“But a necessary one. Don- 

78 


caster could be said to be either 
unfortunately situated — or other- 
wise, according to the viewpoint. 
Here we are, one Man-colonized 
planet on the borders of no less 
than two alien empires. The 
Hallichek Hegemony, the Shaara 
Superive. We know that Imperial 
Earth is already thinking of 
establishing Fortress Doncaster, 
coverting this world into the 
equivalent of a colossal, im- 
pregnably armored and fan- 
tastically armed dreadnought with 
its guns trained upon both avian 
and arthropod. But there are those 
of us who would sooner live in 
peace and friendship with our 
neighbors. That’s why Duncannon 
University has always tried to at- 
tract non-Terran students — and 
that’s why the League of Life was 
brought into being.” She smiled. 
“You could, I suppose, call it 
enlightened self-interest.” 

“Enlightened,” agreed Grimes. 
He liked this girl. She was one 
of those women whose physical 
charm is vastly enhanced by 
enthusiasm. She did far more to 
him and for him than the sort 
of female, equally pretty or pret- 
tier, whom he usually met. 

She said, “I’ve some literature 
at home if you’d like to read 
it.” 

“I should — Selma.” 

She took the use of her given 
name for granted. Was that a 
good sign, or not? 

“That’s splendid, John. We 

GALAXY 


could pick it up now. The party 
can get along without us.” 

“Don’t you live on the pre- 
mises?” 

“No. But it’s only a short walk 
from here. I have an apartment 
in Heathcliff Street.” 

When Grimes had collected his 
boat cloak and cap from the 
cloakroom she was waiting for 
him. She had wrapped herself in 
a green academic gown that went 
well with her hair, matched her 
eyes. Together they walked out 
into the misty night. There was 
just enough chill in the air to 
make them glad of their outer 
garments and to make them walk 
closer together than they would 
have otherwise. Grimes was con- 
scious of the movements of her 
body against his. 

Political literature is a change 
from etchings. 

But he could not remain cynical 
for very long. For he had already 
recognized in her qualities of 
leadership, had no doubt in his 
mind that she would achieve high 
political rank on the world of her 
birth. Nonetheless, this night 
things could happen between them 
and probably would happen be- 
tween them. He, most certainly, 
would not attempt to stem the 
course of nature. Neither of them 
would be the poorer — both, in 
fact, would be the richer. 
Meanwhile it was good to walk 
with her through the soft 
darkness, to let one’s mind dwell 

THE MINUS EFFECT 


pleasurably on what lay ahead at 
the end of the walk. 

“Here we are, John,” she said 
suddenly. 

The door of the apartment 
house was a hazy, golden-glowing 
rectangle in the dimness. They 
met no one in the hallway. An 
elevator bore them swiftly up. Its 
door opened on a richly carpeted 
corridor. There then was another 
door — one that, Grimes noted, 
was opened with an old-fashioned 
metal key. He remembered then 
that voice-actuated locks were not 
very common on Doncaster. 

The furnishings of her living 
room were austere but com- 
fortable. Grimes removed his 
cloak and cap, gave them to her 
to hang up somewhere. He sat 
down on a divan, watched her 
walk to the window that ran all 
along one wall, press the switch 
that drew the heavy drapes aside, 
press another switch that caused 
the wide panes to sink into their 
housing. 

She said, “The view of the city 
is good from here — especially on 
a misty night. And I like it when 
you can smell the clean tang of 
fog in the air.” 

“You’re lucky to get a clean 
fog,” said Grimes, Earth-born and 
Earth-raised. 

He rose and went to stand with 
her. His arm slipped about her 
waist. She made no attempt to 
disengage it. Nonetheless, he 
could still appreciate the view. It 


79 


was superb — like looking down at 
a star cluster enmeshed in a 
gaseous nebula. 

‘•Smell that heavenly mist,” 
Selma whispered. 

Grimes dutifully inhaled. 

Where does that taint of garlic 
come from? Some source in the 
room. 

Grimes could act fast when he 
had to. He sensed rather than 
saw that somebody was rushing 
at him and the girl from behind. 
He let go of her, pushed her 
violently to one side. Instinctively 
he fell into a crouch, felt a heavy 
body thud painfully into his back. 
He dropped still lower, his arms 
and the upper part of his torso 
hanging down over the windowsill. 
What followed was the result of 
luck rather than skill — the 
assailant slithered over Grimes’s 
back, head down, in an ungraceful 
dive. Next Grimes was staring 
down, watching a dark figure fall 
into the luminous mist with 
agonizing slowness, twisting and 
turning as it plunged, screaming. 
The scream was cut short by a 
horridly fluid thud. 

He stood there, trembling un- 
controllably. The reek of garlic 
was still strong in the air. He 
was violently sick. 

<<T here are lessons,” said Com- 

I modore Damien dryly, “that a 
junior officer must learn if he 
wishes to rise in the service. One 
is that it is unwise to throw a 

80 


monkey wrench into the machina- 
tions of our master.” 

“How was I to know, sir?” 
complained Grimes. He flushed. 
“In any case — I’d do it again” 

“I’m sure you would, Mr. 
Grimes. No man in his right 
senses submits willingly to de- 
fenestration — and no gentleman 
stands by and does nothing while 
his companion of the evening is 
subjected to the same fate. Even 
so — ■” he drummed on his desk top 
with his skeletal fingers — “I pro- 
pose to put you into the picture. 
To begin with, the late Mr. Alber- 
to was criminally careless. Ap- 
parently he officiated as usual in 
the high commissioner’s kitchen 
on the night in question. Sir 
William had, earlier in the day, 
expressed a wish for one of the 
more redolent sauces. As a good 
chef should, Alberto tasted, and 
tasted, and tasted. He should have 
deodorized his breath before pro- 
ceeding to Miss Madigan’s apart- 
ment. He was not, I think, ex- 
pecting her to have company.” 

“What happened served the 
bastard right,” Grimes muttered. 

“I’m inclined to agree with you, 
Lieutenant. But we are all of us 
just pawns insofar as Federation 
policy is concerned. Or perhaps 
Alberto was a knight — in the 
chess sense of the word, although 
the German name for that piece, 
springer, would suit him better. 
He was employed by the Depart- 
ment of Socio-Economic Science, 

GALAXY 


and directly responsible only to 
its head. Dr. Barratin. Dr. Barra- 
tin is something of a mathematical 
genius and uses a building full 
of computers to extrapolate from 
the current trends on all the 
worlds in which the Federation 
is interested. Doncaster, I need 
hardly tell you, is such a world 
and the League of Life is a cur- 
rent trend. According to the 
learned doctor’s calculations, this 
same League of Life will almost 
certainly gain some considerable 
influence, even power, under the 
leadership of your Miss 
Madigan. .” 

“She’s not my Miss Madigan, 
sir. Unfortunately.” 

“My heart bleeds for you. But, 
to continue. To Dr. Barratin the 
foreign and colonial policies of 
the Federation can all be worked 
out in advance like a series of 


equations. As you well know, 
however, equations are apt, at 
times, to hold undesirable factors. 
Alberto was employed to remove 
such factors and insure that the 
good doctor’s sums came out. He 
was known to his employers as 
the Subtracter.” 

“Very funny,” said Grimes. 

“Isn’t it?” Damien was laughing 
unashamed. “But when things 
went so very badly wrong on 
Doncaster, Barratin couldn’t see 
the joke, even after I explained 
it to him. Don’t you see, Grimes? 
You were the undesirable factor 
that wasn’t allowed for in the 
equation. Alberto traveled to 
Doncaster in your ship, a Serpent 
Class Courier. You were with 
Miss Madigan when Alberto tried 
to subtract her. You were the ad- 
der.”

The world of nonhumans lies all around you. Feed if, 
love if, pef it — and one day it will include you! 


UT SURELY y°u °f ull people, 
D Mr. Hunter, ought to be- 
lieve in flying saucers,” the Sexy 
New Neighbor said, gulping her 
brandy and keeping a long-eye- 
lashed gimlet eye on the kitten, 
Psycho, who had shown great in- 
terest in her wide-meshed pink 
net stockings. ‘"Because for the 
last twenty-five years the saucer 
people have been telepathically 
giving all you science-fiction 
writers the ideas for all your 
stories, to prepare us humans for 
the day when they openly walk 
among us.” 

: Old .Horsemeat, known to hu-' 

man beings and other non-felines 
as Mr. Harry Hunter, muttered, 
“Or Wriggle,” and writhed his long 
frame a little and thrust forward 
Jiis ill-shaven jaw and decanted 
some brandy into it, preparatory 
to further speech. 

Kitty-Come-Hcre (Mrs. Helen 
Hunter to non-cats), who had in- 
vited the New -Neighbor over be- 
cause Old Horsemeat was easiest 
to live with when he had a 
reasonable supply of sexy women 
around to lecture to on science 
and science fiction and everything 
else, decided she had made an 
awful mistake. 

Gummitch, surveying the scene 
with cool feline unconcern from 
his hair-hatched, black velvet 
cushion-throne in front of the 
fireplace, idly ESP-ed the hate-cat 
waves emanating from the Sexy 

WHEN THEY OPENLY WALK 


New Neighbor and reminded 
himself to explain to Psycho soon 
that Legs, Especially Stockinged 
Female Ones, Are Not For 
Climbing. 

Old Horsemeat splashed brandy 
in his own and the Sexy New 
Neighbor’s goblets, frowned fiend- 
ishly and said (while Kitty- 
Come-Here held her breath), 
“You know. Miss Neering, you 
are the first person — outside of 
Helen and, of course, the cats— to 
penetrate my deepest secret. It's 
absolutely true that' I regularly 
discuss science fiction with a little 
old green man with a white beard 
who hails from Arided. We do 
it almost every other night in the 
back yard at about three A.M. 
He gives me the office— the 
signal, that is— bj tapping on our 
bedroom window with his third 
tentacle, the- one that .extends to 
twenty-seven feet. He then passes 
along some of the damnedest 
ideas. One was cat-burglary— that 
twenty-seven-foot tentacle. Not 
stealing cats, of course (excuse 
me, Gummitch), but second-floor 
stuff like jewels and furs and 
black leather underwear. The old 
Aridedan’s pretty kinky. His latest 
brainwave is how we could poison 
everybody not smart enough to 
drink and cook with sparkling 
water, by sprinkling a couple of

e’s simply testing you on 
II your humanitarianism,” the 
New Neighbor asserted confidently, 
sprawling her mini-skirted frame 
along the cat-scarred couch 
toward Old Horsemeat, though 
not with quite the enthusiasm and 
intense interest one might have 
expected. Most saucer addicts and 
even dabblers do not enjoy having 
the saucer scene stolen from 
them by squares — which includes 
all science-fiction writers, make 
no mistake. 

“Yeah, I think you got it,” Old 
Horsemeat agreed, absently drop- 
ping his hand to the New 
Neighbor’s back and brushing it 
idly. It felt nice but a little scaly. 
“That must be why he started 
putting up objections as soon as 
I said, ‘Let’s do it tonight.’ ” 
“You were testing his hu- 
manitarianism,” the Sexy New 
Neighbor opined rather wisely, 
meanwhile subtly luxuriating her 
shoulders and making what she 
thought , were kitten noises, and 
taking a large sip of her bran- 
dy — no mean tally of simul- 
taneous actions. 

“Uh-uh,” Old Horsemeat de- 
nied. “We got to solve the 
population explosion somehow. 
Which with skins like yours 
around is a toughie.” 

“We’ve always got the pill,” 
she countered. “I’m speaking 
hypothetically.” 

“The pill’ll never be an all-over 
answer,” Old Horsemeat replied 

84 


darkly. “People get absent- 
minded. Or they want buckets of 
kids to boost their egos or hold 
them together or get relief money. 
Or else they want to plain suffer 
for sex — the insufferable puri- 
tans.” 

Kitty-Come-Here sighed with 
relief, though keeping a watchful 
eye on exactly how far Old 
Horsemeat’s idle brushing went. 
She took advantage of the in- 
terlude to snatch up Psycho ex- 
actly a quarter second before the 
kitten launched an all-out assault 
along the Sexy New Neighbor by 
way of the delectable long pink 
ratlines, which looked created to 
receive the tug of tiny claws. 

Gummitch lowered his chin to 
his outstretched forelegs and 
regarded the scene with relaxed, 
utter boredom — a very beautiful 
expression as long as it is on 
the face of a mature cat. 

Old Horsemeat got around to 
telling how the best thing about 
the little old green man was that 
he could do errorless final typing, 
a labor he performed in exchange 
for instruction in the art of writing 
science fiction, so that he- would 
be able to clean up when he got 
back to Arided, top star in the 
Northern Cross. 

The Sexy New Neighbor knew 
when she was being had, or 
decided it was time to show she 
knew so, for she suddenly 

straightened up toward the end 
of the couch away from Old 

GALAXY 


Horsemeat and, gazing at the 
twisting puff of gray fur in the 
flexible cage of Helen Hunter’s 
fingers, asked somewhat loadedly, 
“Why do you call him Psycho?” 

A short silence ensued. 

UU ER,” Kitty-Come-Here cor- 
11 rected. “Yes, you can tell even 
at two months. She doesn’t have 
the two little bumps. See? About 
the name, she actually was psycho 
at first, absolutely off her cat 
rocker. Gummitch led us to her. 
Some dear little children I’d enjoy 
tieing up by their thumbs and 
lashing with a dog whip had shut 
her up for a day or so in a 
fuse box after petting her half 
to death. She was utterly kitten 
crackers the first two days after 
we rescued her, worse than a ju- 
venile delinquent after a police 
storm. She’d hide in the television 
set and scream — or purr and bite 
you. But then Harry hypnotized 
her with Gummitch’s help and she 
snapped out of it and became 
almost too kitten-normal.” 

“What do you mean with 
Gummitch’s help?” Old Horse- 
meat objected. “All by myself I 
shut off all the lights but one 
candle, and then I did the usual 
passes and strokings. You know.” 
He had planned to demonstrate 
them on the Sexy New Neighbor 
but they realized she was 
somewhat too big to be a con- 
vincing analogue of a kitten. 
Besides, she was now too far away 

WHEN THEY OPENLY WALK 


to make the action seem un- 
premeditated. 

oon as the kitten was in a 
J light trance,” he continued, 
“1 told her about the Bill of Rights 
and how in this house it applies to 
cats even more than it does to 
the talking, walking, atom-bomb- 
making simians. Maybe that was a 
little over her head at the time. 
For instance, cats bear arms 
naturally and seldom have soldiers 
quartered on them. But I did con- 
vince her that, one, all children 
belong to an alien, utterly evil 
species, and that, two, decent 
relations based on full equality are 
possible between cat and man. No 
matter what goes on in furriers' 
and pounds.” 

The Sexy New Neighbor drew 
herself together around her brandy 
goblet. For when Old Horsemeat 
ended his ravings, Kitty-Come- 
Here merely nodded solemnly 
once and Gummitch turned on 
her a sinister gaze. She felt she 
had strayed into the old witch- 
house of a cat-centered Charles 
Addams family. 

Psycho chose that moment to 
erupt from her finger-cage, flash 
like a gray streak past the Sexy 
New Neighbor, who dodged un- 
necessarily but quite understand- 
ably, and executed an almost in- 
credible vertical leap, which ended 
with a soft landing on the man- 
telpiece, where she began coolly 
to wash herself.

“Did I remember to tell you 
cats can levitate?” Old Horsemeat 
demanded of the visitor. “Sure 
they can, all of them. But they 
hide it from us. They pretend it’s 
just jumping. What a laugh! I 
think they all migrated here circa 
4,000 B.C. from a high-gravity 
witch-planet. My old Aridedan’s 
got a green cat thin as a string 
bean that can jump over houses. 
Second and third story windows 
open even an inch are a cinch 
for him. He’s kinky about women. 
He likes to crawl into bed with 
them, very softly. Then he slowly 
edges up to them under the sheets. 
His fur is silky as chinchilla. Then 
he bites them.” 

The Sexy New Neighbor re- 
membered she had to work 
tomorrow, gulped her nightcap 
and somewhat dubiously accepted 
Old Horsemeat’s offer to see her 
home next door. 

She pointed at a sleeve-like ar- 
rangement in the bottom of the 
window next to the front door. 

“What’s that?” she asked. 

“The cat door,” Old Horsemeat 
told her. “You think this house 
is a prison.?” 

She concealed a shudder. Old 
Horsemeat didn’t notice it and 
continued blithely — or did notice 
it and continued fiendishly — as he 
swung open the human’s door 
with a grandiose, loose-armed 
sweep and a bow. “Besides levita- 
tion and a lot of other secret 
powers, cats are the next brainiest 


animals to man — or maybe 
brainier and hide it — as is proven 
by their longevity. A cat can live 
twenty years, far and away the 
longest life span for an animal 
anywhere near as small. And if 
you measure life span by total 
lifetime heartbeats for a 
maximum-age animal, the cat 
comes at the top of the list after 
man — 1 ,350,000,000 heartbeats, 
which is 1 50,000.000 more than 
the Methuselah of elephants. I’m 
sure that on most worlds the 
felines rather than the simians are 
actually the chief gnosiphoric 
family — that’s a word I've just 
invented meaning wisdom-bearing. 
What’s more. Miss Neering, or 
Eloise, if I may presume on an 
evening’s conviviality — ” 

As he spoke. Old Horsemeat, 
reeling only a little, guided Miss 
Neering down the front steps, 
keeping a frim grip on her left 
upper arm while she kept an even 
firmer grip on the banister. Now 
as he steered her a weaving course 
across the lawns and as he shifted 
his subject matter from the 
felinocentric to the personal, his 
voice changed from oratorical to 
intimate and faded out. 

II 

K itty-Come-Here could watch 
the seeing-home operation from 
the front porch, where she had 
joined Gummitch for a breath 
of fresh late-summer air and

GALAXY 


a shower of moonlight. When 
Old Horsemeat returned, which 
was very soon, he walked in past 
them without a look or a word, 
poured himself a very large bran- 
dy, drank half of it down and, 
when the door had closed behind 
his cat and wife, exploded with, 
“God deliver me from that in- 
credible kook! Not only a saucer 
nut, but she believes Bacon wrote 
Shakespeare — while riding in a 
saucer over New Atlantis, 1 sup- 
pose. It’s the invariable sign of 
the crackpot — they believe not 
just some but all of the guff. Not 
„ only saucers and Bacon, but 
then there is vegetarianism, rein- 
carnation, compost farming, 
pyramidology, hollow earth, in- 
stant wisdom through psychedelic 
drugs, gut-level thinking smarter 
than Einstein’s induced by bongo 
drums, the whole lot, besides 
being unalterably opposed to 
every chemical and every 
engineering discovery that s hold- 
ing our collapsing civilization 
together. Did you notice how she 
didn’t turn a hair when 1 men- 
tioned plutonium in the drinking 
water. But she went pale when I 
added fluoride.” 

And with that he snatched up 
Psycho, hurdled himself back into 
the armchair beside which he’d 
just very carefully set his glass. 
He began to croon at the kitten, 
holding it to his chest and rocking 
a little, as if only that behavior 
could preserve his sanity. The kit- 

WHEN THEY OPENLY WALK 


ten fought wildly for a moment, 
then quieted. 

“Uh-huh,” said Kitty-Come- 
Here, agreeing with her husband 
but without any great vehemence. 
She knew the habit husbands have 
of berating to their wives any 
woipan to whom they are sexually 
attracted. She yawned. “I’m going 
to bed,” she said, moving about, 
turning out lights. 

“Leave on that Tensor lamp 
across from me,” Old Horsemeat 
said. “I’ve got to hypnotize 
Psycho first, and it’ll do for a 
candle. That kooky woman got 
her all roiled up. My God, Helen, 
don’t you realize it’s cult-crazy 
people like her who are trying 
to kill science and hurry us into 
a new dark age?” 

Kitty-Come-Here stopped and 
thought for a while and then said 
judiciously, “I wouldn’t worry 
about Miss Neering. Harry. I 
think her crackpot delusions are 
very superficial. Underneath she’s 
much more interested in small, 
deep saucers of brandy than the 
flying kind — and in tall, sexy 
Earthmen rather than little old 
green men from outer space. 

She started up the stairs. 

Old Horsemeat just shrugged. 
Rhythmically stroking Psycho, he 
began to croon in deep winning 
tones, “You’re getting sleepy, little 
cat, very sleepy. You can hardly 
hold your head up. You're getting 
sleepier — ” 

Psycho started wriggling. 


87 


K tty-Come-Her^ stopped on 
the sixth step and looked back 
"at Old Horsemeat. “I am going 
to bed,” she repeated. “You can 
hypnotize Psycho all night. Or 
read Herman Hesse. Or get dead 
drunk and pass out on the floor. 
Nobody cares. This is Liberty 
Hall. But — ” a new and somewhat 
knifelike tone came into her 
voice — “but — and I want you 
to listen to this, Gummitch — ” 

The big cat lifted his head from 
where he lay again on his throne 
and looked straight at Kitty- 
Come-Here. 

“But,” she continued, the word 
now a small explosion, “if that 
big brutal Svengali over there 
merely tries to stir out of this 
house tonight in the direction of 
Miss Neering’s, say on the excuse 
of returning that kooky slut her 
compact and handkerchief — oh, 
we saw him shove them down 
in the crack of the couch, didn’t 
we, Gummitch, when he thought 
neither of us would notice? Well, 
then you bite him, Gummitch, you 
bite him good and hard. And if 
he still persists, you come upstairs 
•and bite me until I’m wide awake 
and insane with anger.” 

Gummitch dropped his head 
again with the effect of a curt 
nod of affirmation. Old Horse- 
meat did not deign to rely. Kitty- 
Come-Here’s footsteps proceeded 
upward and died down the hall. 
The living room was eerie with 

88 


its one small cone of bright light 
in the great mass of semi- 
darkness. 

Old Horsemeat began to chant 
rumblingly, “Now you're getting 
sleepier and (yawn) sleepier, little 
cat. You can hardly hold your 
eyes open — ” 

Psycho began another bout of 
wriggling. Gummitch lifted his 
head again and eyed her with 
peculiar cat-to-kitten fierceness. 
Psycho quieted once more. 

“You’re getting still sleepier, 
little cat,” Old Horsemeat rum- 
bled on. “Every little cat muscle 
in you is relaxing (yawn) until 
you’re limp as a dishrag. Now 
your eyes are completely closed. 
Your head is down. You’re asleep, 
little cat, you’re a — ” 

The hypnotism worked. Old 
Horsemeat’s head sank back, his 
eyes closed fully and his rumbling 
changed into a gentle snore. 

HI 

E yes bright as diamonds, Psy- 
cho held absolutely still in the 
big, limp hands. 

For twenty seconds the com- 
fortable old living room was quiet 
as a crypt, except for the gentle 
snoring. 

Psycho eased from between the 
hands, flowed down Old Horse- 
meat’s trousered thigh and landed 
beside Gummitch like a puff of 
coherent smoke. 

Without a word or a look, 

GALAXY 


Gummitch turned, made a short 
run past the Tensor’s bright cone, 
and sprang through the cat door. 
Psycho swiftly followed, executing 
a comically frantic twist and a 
clawing pull midway. 

They stood side by side at the 
top of the front-porch steps. The 
faintly cool yet balmy night was 
alive (for cats) with many 
sounds, from the soft panting of 
a big dog in the high-fenced yard 
beyond Miss Neering’s place to 
the stumbling walk of a nearby 
beetle over crisp, fallen leaves. 
Moonlight sprinkled down on 
them, a palpable silver rain. And 
there were cat-multitudinous 
sights (a many-layered world of 
sharp shadows) and scents and 
the pressure of a faint breeze on 
whiskers and fur, and the upward 
thrust of painted old wood under 
paw-pads. 

Tonight this shadowy, silvery, 
murmury world was spiced with 
excitement and carried also a spe- 
cial call, yearning, imperious and 
enravishing. 

Gummitch made his head into 
a compass and slowly turned it 
this way and that, hunting the 
vector of the call. Finally a needle 
of nerves stopped rocking. His 
head and eyes were directed at 
the hedge in front of Miss Neer- 
ing’s place. Again without word 
or sidewise look, he trotted in 
that direction with Psycho loping 
close at his right side, head level 
with the big cat’s shoulder. 

WHEN THEY OPENLY WALK 


A fixed male cat, the Mad 
Eunuch, in whom neutering had 
produced a weird belligerence and 
with whom Gummitch had had 
many famous fights, came track- 
ing after them as they reached 
the hedge and went slinking along 
it. But Gummitch paid the new 
and more careless paw-paddings 
no attention. Even Psycho did no 
more than stiffen his silvery fur. 
And for once the Mad Eunuch 
did not run amuck, only followed 
two dozen cat paces behind. 

There also fell into line, still 
farther back, an almost skeletally 
gaunt alley cat, whom Old Horse- 
meat had nicknamed the Flying 
Dutchman for his raggedy black, 
dirty-white and reddish fur and 
his habit of always approaching 
tremblingly and with an infinite 
caution the Hunter back door and 
then tearing off in mad panic if 
someone came out or even if 
footsteps sounded too loudly 
inside. Gummitch himself had 
never been able to contact this 
unhappy hobo cat, for whom he 
felt considerable sympathy be- 
cause of his own background as 
a starved and orphaned kitten. 
If he hadn’t been rescued by Old 
Horsemeat and Kitty-Come- 
Here — and hadn’t died — he might 
well have become such a dismal 
bindlestiff. 

A s the little cat cortege passed 
the hedge and started along the 
high fence beyond it, the big dog 

89 


began to bark hysterically. But 
the cats ignored this utterly, ex- 
cept that Psycho jumped over 
Gummitch, sudden as an electric 
shock, light and noiseless as a 
feather, and then proceeded along 
as if nothing had happened and 
as if her courage had never 
faltered, except that now she was 
on the bigger cat’s larboard in- 
stead of starboard side. 

Nor, across the street and 
moving in the same direction, did 
the big sleek black male and his 
silvery tiger consort take any note 
of the sudden torrent of canine 
noise. 

Nor did even the Flying 
Dutchman do more than tremble 
a little harder as he single-footed 
forward. Evidently the dog found 
something eerie in this utter lack 
of reaction from cats to his most 
horrible threats, for his barking 
suddenly became more whimper- 
ing than hysterical and faded 
down abruptly as he fled to the 
protection of his porch and magic 
doormat. 

Ahead was a small park with 
a grove of trees in its center, all 
balmy in the moonlight. It was 
there that Gummitch’s compass 
led them — and not Gummitch’s 
alone, for now it was clear that 
there was a trickling of cats from 
all the streets around — tabbies, 
Persians, Siamese, tiger and bar- 
red, alleys, house and store — and 
all silently and unconflictingly 
headed for the grove in the park. 

90 


A cop on his beat would surely 
have noticed them. But the two 
cruising by in their squad car 
could not see low-striding cats. 
In fact, they were becoming 
unable to see night-time human 
pedestrians, except as potential 
rioters, thieves, looters, delin- 
quents and co-killers. 

An old drunk crouching away 
almost cat-low from the police 
headlights did notice the stream- 
ing cats and he studied them 
blinkingly, long after the police 
car was gone. Fuzzily the thought 
came to him that a world with 
sights as strange as this might 
still be worth living in — or 
perhaps it was only that the delay 
lowered the alcohol content of his 
blood — at any rate, the hazy idea 
of suicide sank back down into 
his subconscious like miasma into 
a marsh. He turned back toward 
Skid Row from the street that 
led toward the river. 

A girl saw the cats, though her 
boy friend didn’t. He was intent 
only on her. Anns around each 
other, they were headed toward 
the grove. 

She thought the cats were kind 
of beautiful but they spooked her. 

So she said, “Honey, I’ve 
changed my mind. Like let’s go 
to my place like we planned.” 

He said, “But, baby, you just 
said you were afraid your 

folks—” 

She said, “I just remembered 

GALAXY 


IV 


they’re sure to be away all night. 
They always get stoned and pass 
out when they go to the Wilsons’.” 
He said, “I don’t know. It 
doesn’t sound too safe to me. 

She said, “Are you scared, 
honey?” 

He said, “Of course not. But 
the way you keep changing your 
mind is driving me out of my 
gourd.” 

She said, “Please, honey, I’d 
rather. And it’ll be nicer.” 

He said fondly, “You’re a 
freak, baby, a complete freak.” 

She said, “Besides, I’d get up- 
tight with all these cats watching 
us.” 

He said, noting them belatedly, 
“Crazy. Must be Bast-worship 
night. Luna in Leo. Cats high 
and doing their God-thing. Make 
my nose run — not their fault, just 
allergy. Okay, okay, honey. 
Anything you say.” 

The lovers turned back. The 
cats flowed across the springy 
turf, their vari-colored fur all 
bright platinum to gleaming obsi- 
dian in the moonlight, no spectral 
colors at all. As their first ranks 
entered the grove, there was a 
faint crackling of fallen leaves and 
the platinum-obsidian became a 
moving variation of brightness in 
the moon-dapple everywhere. 

No, not quite everywhere. Near 
the center of the grove, on the 
side away from the moon, was 
an ellipse of unbroken blackness 
a little more than twenty feet long. 

WHEN THEY OPENLY WALK 


T his shadow was cast by a 
bulge-centered, flattish, cir- 
cular object poised in the treetops 
exactly over the small glade in 
the middle of the grove. At first 
glance it would have seemed to 
rest on the branches all around. 
But then it would have been seen 
that the branches up there were 
hardly more than twigs, not strong 
enough to support such an object 
even if formed of thinnest alu- 
minum. And in any case the twigs 
were not bent particularly down- 
ward. It would have become clear 
that the object, which resembled 
two huge saucers clapped together 
rim to rim, merely rested among 
the slim branches, held up by 
some invisible power of its own. 

The , cats filled the grove, 
crowding around the black ellipse, 
but none entering it, as if it 
were a black abyss and they all 
nosing at its brim. 

A bough creaked and a large, 
slim shape dropped down to 
crouch effortlessly in a moon- 
pied, wide crotch midway between 
the circular vehicle and the 
ground. All the cats looked up, 
their eyes close-paired moonstones 
or pearls baroque with bulging, 
vertical black streaks. 

“’Alio, li’l fren’s,” a soft yet 
vibrant voice called down. “I’m 
glad many of you came tonight, 
for I’ve news. May be a relief 
to some and just may make a 

91 


few sad for a while. But not to 
worry, any of you.” 

The accent of the voice was 
very strange and the tone stranger. 
If one can imagine the purring 
of a eat, or a tiger, shaped to 
human speech, shaped to English, 
one gets an approximation. 

Stranger still, perhaps, though 
most appropriate, all the cats 
below had begun to purr like 
sleepy beehives the instant the 
shape had dropped to the crotch. 

“You ’ave a good week, li’l 
sneakers?” the voice continued in 
a note of affectionate badinage. 
“Meat, clear water, milk? The 
monkeys decent to you?” 

The purring continued to rise 
like a low-pitched note, sounded 
pianissimo, in an orchestra of 
cellos or viola da gambas. But 
here and there it changed to low 
wailings and mewings. 

“Tha’s bad. Tha’s ’bominable. 
Well kill us some nice people, 
eh? Kill us some hippies. Kill us 
some cops.” 

G radually the shape became 
clearer in the moon dapple. 
Imagine a figure midway between 
that of a leopard, a large cheetah 
and a slender and supple young 
woman covered with short fur. 
Still a mere approximation. It 
crouched a little, more like a 
young woman than a feline. But 
the hand by which it steadied 
itself had dark pads and long 
claws sharply curved at their tips. 

92 


The femininity was definite. It 
was beautiful. 

Suddenly it leaped forward out 
of moon dapple into darkness and 
landed with hardly a sound in 
the center of the elliptical shadow. 
There it stretched prone, almost 
invisible except for the low 
silhouette it made with tufted ears 
and slowly switching tail, a slim 
recumbent sphinx. After a while 
there was the faintest glint of fur 
and claw and the glow of eyes 
whose pupils were like black 
flowers with five narrow petals 
tapering to points. 

“Come on. Come to me,” the 
voice purred. “Don’ be scared.” 

There was a wait. Then Gum- 
mitch strode into the ellipse, bis 
head high, his fur flat. Psycho 
moved anxiously and strained 
forward but did not follow. The 
sphinx reached out a slim paw 
to catch up Gummitch. But in- 
stead of making his body yielding 
he stood with four legs straight 
and firmly planted and she con- 
tented herself with softly tickling 
his chest and stroking his back, 
her claws retracted. He suppled 
himself without becoming limp 
and he twisted his neck appre- 
ciatively, 

“I know you,” she crooned, 
“you’re the cool one. What is it 
you’re called? Oh, yes, of course, 
Goomitch — what a name! Trust 
the monkeys to think up one like 
that, bad as their language, which 
to tell the truth, Goomitch, I’d 

GALAXY 


never have bothered to learn ex- 
cept I was bored and wanted to 
make familiar noises at you and 
your fren’s. Oh, they’re not all 
fren’s, eh? Well, it’s the same with 
my people. 

“But how about it, Goomitch, 
shall we get rid of the monkeys 
and put you cats in charge around 
here? Like it should be. Except 
you’re all pretty little. 

“What’s that you say? There 
are big cats across the waters? 
Bigger even than me? Amazing! 
I’ll have to investigate if I still got 
the time. 

“They’re here, too? In a big 
park? And you’ve seen them? Ac- 
tually seen them yourself? Old 
Horsemeat took, no — smoogled 
you in under his coat? What kind 
of a monkey name is Old Horse- 
meat? Oh, I see, it’s your name 
for him, from what he feeds you. 

“You tried to talk to the big 
cats but they couldn’t understand 
you? They were — stupid? That 
doesn’t make sense. You know 
what, Goomitch, I don’ think you 
and your fren’s are related to 
them at all. I think you’re all 
dwarf jester-cats and playcats lef’ 
behind when some ship of my 
people made a landing here 
millennia ago. Your cats’ cradle 
is in the stars, maybe. Anyhow, 
you should come to my planet! 
There you’d find all the cats as 
much smarter than you as you’re 
smarter than mice. 

“You don’ think mice and rats 


are so stupid? Well — butterflies 
then, gol'fish. 

“The big cats are dangerous? 
Now you’re talking like a monkey. 
They keep them behind bars? In 
cages? That’s indecent! That’s a 
crime against the universe! The 
monkeys should be destroyed, if 
only for est’etic reasons. I think 
I’ll kill as many of them as I 
can before I go. 

“You wouldn’t like that? What 
kind of a cat you are, Goomitch? 
You’ve got a slave mentality! 
What do your fren’s say?” 

The slim sphinx lifted her 
magnificent head, tufted ears 
peaked, fur bristling, long 
whiskers a-twitch, lips drawn back 
from fangs, five-petaled eyes 
flashing. 

The purring round about in- 
creased. The cats pushed closer 
inward, though still none of them 
besides Gummitch ventured from 
the moon-dappled space into the 
black ellipse. The circle of their 
small eyes gleamed like rosaries 
of pearls. 

Slowly" swiveling her head, the 
sphinx asked clearly, thrice, 
“Should I kill the monkeys?” 

There were mewings, hissings 
and wails, though the purring still 
predominated. 

The black, five-pointed stars 
of the sphinx’s pupils contracted 
and she looked upward a little 
and held very still, as if listening 
to the inaudible and dissecting and 
numerating it. 


WHEN THEY OPENLY WALK

At last she dropped her head 
and said, “Ffft! They’re slaves 
too, except for a few lonelies and 
pure blood-mads and some that, 
excuse my bad manners, aren’t 
very right in their heads. I should 
have expected they were all 
cowards, when only one came 
when I called.” Again she lifted 
her head. “Won’ some more of 
you come to me, please? Won’ 
jus’ one? 

“What’s that you say now, 
Goomitch? You’re not a slave? 
You live with the monkeys as an 
equal? No, that can’t be. Some- 
one’s — how do you say? — sold 
you a bill of goods. 

“No, not even with one monkey 
is it possible.. Monkeys are just 
monkeys, always. 

“I don’t quite. Yes. Yes. 
Oh, now I understand. You think 
you control what your monkey 
does, or at least have fifty per 
cent control? That’s what every 
slave believes — when times are 
good. But when times are bad, 
when there's hunger, something 
stolen, something broken, a child 
scratched, then’s the moment of 
truth. ‘Alio, who’s this?” 

The sphinx’s gaze went beyond 
Gummitch. Trembling in every 
emaciated member and putting 
one shaking foot at a time in 
front of the next ahead, as if 
he were walking a tight wire, the 
Flying Dutchman had stepped 
across the boundary of darkness. 
His ears were laid back, his big- 

94 


pupiled, protuberant eyes stared, 
his ragged hair was irregularly 
erected, he panted, showing his 
yellow fangs, one of which was 
broken. His slack, long, pale-pink- 
and-black tongue lolled from the 
side of his mouth. 

Finally he came within the 
sphinx’s reach and stopped, as if 
he had expended all his courage 
and energy in the act of a lifetime. 
He swayed and almost fell over. 

V 

F ar more slowly, tentatively 
and gently than she had with 
Gummitch, the sphinx crept out 
a paw and touched him thistle- 
down lightly. As she feather- 
stroked him, he responded more 
swiftly and completely than Gum- 
mitch had and soon collapsed into 
the padded, fur-edged hand. She 
carefully lifted him and held him 
lightly against her breast. 

“There, there, there, Flyin’ 
Dushman,” she crooned. “My, 
my, oh, yes, but you’ve had a 
hard life. But you never been 
behind bars. You never los’ your 
bravery.” She looked up. “What’s 
that you’re askin’, Goomitch? Oh, 
you noticed my ‘if I still got the 
time’ and ‘before I go.’ You got 
a mind like a detective. Well, it’s 
true what you guessed. Listen to 
me, all of you! My sub-etheric 
SOS — after the explosion of 
the. Saber-tooth, you’d say, with 
only me outboard — finally got 

GALAXY 


noticed and a star-drive ship 
bound from Alpha Libra Four to 
the Pleiades is picking me up at 
dawn at the top of your 
ionosphere above your south 
pole.” 

The purring of almost all the 
cats turned to a subdued cater- 
wauling and to whimpering mews. 

“That’s nice,” the sphinx said. 
“I’m glad you’re sorry a little. 

I mus’ say I’m a li’l sorry too, 
jus’ on your account, though I’ll 
be glad to leave monkeyland! 

“One thing more.” With a final 
caress she set the Flying 
Dutchman down as far away from 
her as Gummitch stood. The hobo 
cat reeled a little, but then 
although trembling once more, got 
his balance. “I ’ave space for 
three or four of you aboard. Who 
wants to come?” 

The purring recommenced, be- 
came a great soft vibration. All 
the cats in the moonlight strained 
forward one more time, yet not 
one entered the inky ellipse. 

“ ’Ow about you, Goomitch?” 
the sphinx asked winningly. “You 
come with me, eh?” 

From the edge of the ellipse, 
Psycho mewed anxiously. 

Gummitch stared the sphinx 
straight in the eyes. Then without 
changing his gaze, he deliberately 
moved backward half the length 
of his body. 

At the same time the Flying 
Dutchman gave a rasping, ragged 
“Phrrrt!” like an aged drunk 

WHEN THEY OPENLY WALK 


trying to baby-talk. He staggered 
forward. 

The sphinx caught him up again 
and said tenderly, laughing at 
herself, “So you’s all I get, you 
old wreck, you ancient mariner. 

I bet you and your parasites burn 
out my demicrobing machine!” 
She looked up. “Remember me,” 
she said, impassive-faced. “Tell 
your kittens about me. Life’s not 
so bad here and now, you think. 
A few of you, like Goomitch, even 
dream of an impossible cat-man 
symbiosis. But the times will come 
again, even here, when you’re 
hunted down as witch-things, yes, 
hunted for food. Remember me. 
And then when your day comes, 
as it will, put down the monkeys 
without mercy. And when you 
finally get the star-drive, come 
visit me at the Pleiades. Ask at 
any inhabited planet in the cluster. 
Remember.” 

When Kitty-Come-Here, again 
cleared-eyed, primped and lace- 
robed, came briskly downstairs 
the next morning, Old Horsemeat 
was still asleep, pain-faced, with 
Psycho in his lap, while Gum- 
mitch was coiled on his cushion. 
As she went around to whir 
drapes apart and let in blasts of 
sunlight, the two cats wakened. 
Gummitch mewed a casual ‘ good 
morning,” and started toward the 
kitchen. Psycho followed him. 

Old Horsemeat’s eyes slowly 
came ungummed. Then he gave 
a sizable start. 

95 


“Oh, my God, Helen,” he said. 
“Easy on that light. Why 
didn't you make me go upstairs 
to bed? I 'in so stiff I know I'm 
going to break something unkink- 
itig.” 

“Up to bed?” she asked in 
mock amazement, whirring 
another set of drapes apart. “Why, 
I was letting you have your night 
on the tiles and it’s your own 
fault if you were too unenterpris- 
ing to anything but pass out and 
get creaky-jointed. For that matter, 
I gave all three of you your night 
on the tiles and none of you seems 


to have taken advantage.' What 
stay-by-the-f ires! ” 

“There wasn’t any fire,” Old 
Horsemeat complained morosely 
as he gingerly worked with his 
fingers at his neck and the smalt 
of his back. “In fact, it’s still 
damn chilly, you would-be mur- 
deress.” 

Next door Eloise Neering woke 
with the thought, “That big, old, 
conceited lecher and his brunette 
Lucille-Ball wife! What a scene! 
And all those crazy cats!”

GALAXY'S STARS 


For many years the credit line "il- 
lustrated by GAUGHAN" has her- 
alded some of the most imaginative 
(remember Dragon Masters and 
Specter?) artwork In our pages. 
With this issue that name moves to 
the masthead as Jack Gaughan be- 
comes Associate Art Director of 
the GALAXY magazines, an ap- 
pointment we have long antici- 
pated. In recognition of his out- 
standing work in the field, Jack has 
received three Hugos to date, and 
he will be the guest of honor at the 
World Science Fiction Convention 
in St. Louis in September — only 
one other artist has been so hon- 
ored in the field. "I have been 
reading science fiction," Jack says, 
"since a nun in a Catholic high 
school made me read Out of the Si- 
lent Planet as punishment for open- 
ing a big mouth; and I've been 
hung up on the stuff ever since." 


Leaving home base in Ohio after 
serving in the army, Jack came to 
New York and did the nine-to-five 
routine as art director and consult- 
ant for various ad agencies and 
film companies. Till his wife en- 
couraged him to stop making mon- 
ey and to do what he really 
wanted. He's been sf-ing ever since. 

Believe it or not, Jack lives 
in a big, bat-filled (the winged 
kind) belfry in Rifton, New York 
with wife Phoebe, son Brian, 

daughter Norah and mother-in-law 
Susan — all artists. When he doesn't 
have a paint brush in hand, he's 
holding onto a hose and putting 
out Rifton fires; he's secretary of 
the local volunteer fire department. 
And there he sits, as we write this, 
thinking "What in hell am I going

GALAXY 



L agrad Timmothane walked 
across the yellow sponge- 
plastic floor of the Hospital li- 
brary to Information — a multi- 
faceted computer — and stared 
with confusion at its steel-blue 
features. 

t From his right a feminine voice 
said' pleasantly, “You're new, 
Green-eyes. May I help you?” 


The girl had appeared from a 
door next to the computer and 
was offering a smile to match 
the cordial 'ay she’d spoken. 

“I don’t know if you have any 
tapes on it yet, but I’m interested 
in any information on the Far 
East New.” 

The girl turned from him, 
began punching rhythmically at 


97 



the computer keyboard and said. 
“Are you thinking of joining -the 
survey?’’ 

“No. Rather, T don’t know yet. 
My brother is out in the New, 
and I suppose I’m considering it. 
Right now I’m resting for the 
Operation.” Lagrad hesitated and 
then added courteously, “I’m 
Fifth Gardner for the Hospital 
Circle until the Operation.” 

She turned back to him. Mixed 
with an odd far-away look in her 
eyes was a mood that could have 
been anger. Lagrad felt confused; 
had he said something wrong? 

“I'm sorry,” the girl said. “We 
have nothing on that new Sector." 

Lagrad noticed the piece of 
jewelry over the girl’s left breast. 
Molded from gold and a large 
red stone, the heart-shaped brooch 
was almost phosphorescent but 
easily hidden by the pink curls 
of her dress — a dress style in per- 
fect match with the top-knot of 
pink curls resting on the back 
of her head like the crest of a 
bird. Her forehead and scalp back 
to the curls had been rouged pink 
and — now that Lagrad thought 
about it — the girl was attractive, 
even in her painted way. 

His eyes returned to the brooch. 
Inside his head, Lagrad’s heart 
croaked into sarcastic coherency: 
So someone still respects the 
shape I'm in. 

Lagrad sent back a sharp 
thought. 

Keep silent. 

93 


Yon know that's impossible, his 
heart retorted. 

L agrad managed to disregard 
the very real voice that sizzled 
in his head, all over his body. 
The Operation, he reflected to 
calm himself, would soon remedy 
permanently the annoyance of 
that voice. 

He had been staring at the girl 
for a minute when she said, still 
upset about something, “If you’re 
wondering about my brooch, it 
has a special meaning for me.” 
After a moment's hesitation she 
added: “I suppose you’re another 
who feels no compunction about 
going through with the Opera- 
tion!” 

Her sarcastic tone was unex- 
pected, as was the subject of her 
comment. 

Lagrad said, “I don't under- 
stand.” 

I do, said his heart. 

Shut up, heart! Let me talk 
to this girl. Lagrad calmed 
himself again by remember- 
ing that the Operation would be 
in three weeks; in three weeks 
his heart would be silenced and 
replaced with a synthetic heart 
that would never bother him with 
words. 

“I really don’t know what you 
mean.” 

“I’m sure you don’t. We’re both 
young but I have gotten to know 
my heart and the Truth. The 
Operation is very wrong.” 

GALAXY 


Lagrad had never heard talk 
like this before. And the girl was 
so forward. 

“And you won't understand 
what l mean,” the girl resumed, 
“until you’ve really listened to 
your heart. Haven’t you heard 
what it’s trying to tell you. Your 
heart has as much right to live 
as you do. Green-eyes.” 

Again the gauche colonial-class 
use of the appellation — which 
meant, as all such breaching of 
proper names meant, a liking for 
him. But the liberty the girl Was 
now taking socially with Lagrad 
bothered him much less than her 
negative opinion of the heart 
operation. 

“When is your Operation?” the 
girl asked, her anger waning. 

“In a few weeks.” 

“Would you be willing to spend 
some time talking about your 
heart?” 

Lagrad smiled, understanding 
now. The girl was just an easy 
“love-to” and the talk about the 
Operation was meant to make him 
curious, her come-on line. Lagrad 
had no objections. Though he'd 
never had relationships with those 
women society called Iove-tos, he 
knew that involvement with one 
-or two of them a year was ac- 
ceptable. It wasn't written down 
anywhere — but he knew. 

“When?” Lagrad smiled again. 

“Tomorrow evening at eight. In 
the room behind that door.” She 

LIFE MATTER 


added, “My name is Beodora 
P’Att'ann.” 

Lagrad looked to the smooth 
door behind the girl, then nodded. 
“I’m Lagrad Timniolhane.” 

Your name is Lecher, his heart 
boomed. 

Shut up, heart. 

As Lagrad turned to leave, he 
noticed again the faraway look 
in the girl’s eyes. 

A s FIFTH GARDNER for the Hos- 
pital Circle Lagrad had his 
own tower for gardening. Below 
his tower thirty grassy acres were 
ribbed with aesthetic shrubs and 
flowers, all stretching to the ter- 
ritory borders of the other 
gardners, or to the wall of the 
Hospital — that monolithic build- 
ing where he would soon be 
inhaling the anesthesia for his 
Operation. 

Everyone at twenty-one years 
of age — the age for the Operation, 
the age when the heart's murmur- 
ings became at once totally com- 
prehensible and obnoxious be- 
cause of their coherency — went to 
a Control hospital world, was 
employed in a relaxing job of gar- 
dening, library work, room main- 
tenance or supply-ship unloading 
and awaited his or her appoint- 
ment in the Operations room. The 
whole procedure — preparation and 
Operation — was not particularly 
unpleasant. And, according to 
doctors of all specializations, the 
Operation was mandatory for an 

99 




adulthood of physical and mental 
health. 

The control panel in front of 
Lagrad offered a lone blinking 
light, the symbol of the last 
mobile garden tool patrolling its 
territory under Lagrad's com- 
mand: one killer machine was still 
out looking for unesthetic plants 
which random nature insisted on 
sneaking into the hospital grounds. 
Dusk was settling now, and 
Lagrad deactivated the last killer, 
which began to coast toward the 
subterranean housing for the 
eighteen similar garden tools. 

He found himself thinking of 
his brother, of the life his brother 
had chosen. Micccl was the rebel 
of the family. He had chosen not 
to enter the Mal-space Biotronics 
Engineer Guild of Lagrad's father. 
He had chosen the New. 

Waiting around for the Opera- 
tion — Lagrad realized — also gave 
one time to make the big decision: 
either to marry a woman, retain 
the security of employment in 
one's father’s guild, and remain 
on one of the Control worlds, 
most of which were like the Crux- 
planet. Earth; or to leave the 
Control Systems entirely, post- 
pone marriage perhaps indefinitely 
and depart for the virgin 
darknesses of the New galaxies, 
as his brother had done quite 
recently and quite romantically 
with the Survey. 1 

Lagrad had that decision to 
make. There was no woman in 


his life, so the New had the ad- 
vantage. 

R epeating the path that had led 
him to Beodora the previous 
morning, Lagrad entered the main 
library room, walked to the in- 
formation computer, stopped to 
gaze at the door behind the coun- 
ter and passed through an opening 
in the counter to reach the ren- 
dezvous door. 

Before he could knock, the 
door slid open and he froze. 

The room beyond yawned at 
him in a colorful tableau of faces, 
showing him the nearer features ' 
of all-pink Beodora P'Att’ann, 
who had just opened the door for 
him — and also the farther features 
of a dozen young men and women 
dressed in various vogues of the 
day: a violet curl-dress with 

matching conical hair style; a 
chartreuse man's jump-suit with 
transparent plasticioth sleeves; a 
saffron-colored star-burst outfit. 

But most important, Lagrad 
noticed they were all wearing 
heart-brooches like Bcodora's. 
The girl had been serious. She 
wasn't a love-to after all. 

Before Lagrad could brood on 
his disappointment, Beodora took 
him by the arm, by his own 
transparent sleeve, and pulled him 
slowdy into the room. Faint smiles 
were beginning to appear on all 
the faces in the room but no one 
spoke. Lagrad w'as uncomfortable 
in the silence.

GALAXY 


Abruptly Beodora addressed 
her fellow members of the club. 

“This is Lagrad Timmothane, 
who is residing here on Green- 
johnson in preparation for his 
Operation.” To Lagrad she said, 
“We are all librarians, Green- 
eyes, and our sharing of one belief 
makes us a minority club here 
at the Hospital.” 

Again to her colleagues, she 
said, “Submitting or not to the 
Operation is an individual’s pre- 
rogative. We have no right to in- 
timidate Lagrad into a decision 
against the Operation but I do 
believe we have the right to ex- 
press our belief.” 

The librarians continued to 
watch him, still with faint smiles. 

After a pause Beodora went 
on: “As librarians we know the 
tapes in our library by content 
as well as by number and subject 
indices. Consequently we know 
history. We know the past and 
one learns from the past. Lagrad, 
please listen to what the past says. 
Over and over again it tells that 
man’s heart should remain in his 
chest — where it was born to 
be — and not be ripped from the 
blood-roots of man’s breast to be 
replaced with a synthetic pump.” 
As if on cue, a tall young man 
about twenty-five spoke suddenly. 
He quoted a strange piece of 
literature, pro-heart and anti- 
Operation. Then another librarian 
spoke up, quoting — and then 
another and another. 


In fifteen minutes Lagrad was 
dizzy. The voices of the librarians 
were telling him the same strange 
thing over and over again. 

“Keep your heart — 

“Listen to the past — ” . 

“Keep your heart — ” After 
quote upon quote, the voices were 
fusing into one sound, woven 
together now by Beodora’s sudden 
voice, quoting and quoting. 

“I heard a wise man say, give 
crowns and pounds and guineas, 
but not your heart away, and oh, 
’tis true, ’tis true; God made a 
heart of gold, of gold, shining 
and sweet and true, gave it a 
home of fairest mold, blest it, 
and called it — you; two evils, 
monstrous either one apart: a cry 
of absence, absence in the heart!” 
His dizziness roared. Over it 
Lagrad heard Beodora whisper 
just to him, “I like you, Green- 
eyes. And I like your heart. Keep 
your heart, Green-eyes. For me.” 
Lagrad turned suddenly, broke 
away from Beodora’s touch, 
stumbled from the library and 
walked quickly across the neatly 
trimmed grass toward his dor- 
mitory. 

His heart remained silent. 
Lagrad was sincere when he said, 
“Thank you, heart, for your 
silence.” 

I t was embarrassing, but at 4:35 
the next afternoon after work, 
Lagrad found himself seeking 
Beodora in the library. 


LIFE MATTER 


101 


“I’m sorry about last night. I 
hadn’t realized so many others 
would be there with you.” 

Lagrad found it easy to gaze 
into her faraway look and to 
disregard the formality he’d al- 
ways been taught and to confide 
in her. 

“We’re sorry, too. But it seems 
you just don’t know how to listen, 
to think about things that are new 
to you.” 

The girl's condescension was 
heavy and Lagrad felt angry for 
a moment. 

Silence reigned. Beodora’s ex- 
pression was pink marble. 

Under the pressure of the 
silence, Lagrad’s anger died. 

He nodded, sighed and amazed 
himself by saying, “You are so 
right. I am naive. My life up 
to now has been quite limited. 
I will try to listen better.” He 
added: “I wanted to ask you if 
you’d care to go with me to the 
Ponds after you've finished here. 

Beodora flashed a wise, smile 
and said, “I would, yes. 
but aren’t you afraid I’ll start lec- 
turing you again?” 

Lagrad appreciated the humor, 
feeling at ease for the first time 
in a long time. Returning the 
smile, he was suddenly aware that 
the Operation question was sec- 
ondary in his mind. This strange 
girl named Beodora — definitely 
not a love-to — was the prime at- 
traction, her odd credo concerning 
the Operation coming second. 

102 


They went to the Ponds that 
evening and every evening for two 
weeks, unless they were hearing 
tapes, ancient and modern, which 
Beodora had selected for them 
from the library. The tapes cov- 
ered the subject of the human 
heart but there were also words 
about love, green worlds, hap- 
piness, joy, ecstasy, and marriage. 
Marriage. Lagrad began thinking 
of marriage, and going to the New 
began to dim in appeal. 

L agrad discovered that Beodo- 
ra was two years older than he, 
and she had originally come to 'the 
hospital world for the Opera- 
tion — but had decided against it 
when she realized the Operation 
was an atrocity against life and 
man. During that time she had 
also decided to marry. But to 
marry only the right kind of man, 
a Truth-seeking man. 

Beodora was a fine young wo- 
man and Lagrad even enjoyed it 
when she lectured him about 
history when they were by the 
Ponds — or in the side room of 
the library — or by the flowers 
around his dormitory. 

“Man’s been changing. Evolu- 
tion molds him. Among other 
things, man has gradually lost his 
hair. Once he had hair on the 
front half of his scalp and on 
his chest. Once man’s arms hung 
almost down to his knees instead 
of to his hips, like today. Once 
man had five toes instead of three. 

GALAXY 


And once man had a silent heart. 
Then, when man stepped off his 
nest-planet — the planet we call 
Crux or Earth — and offered his 
vulnerable body to radiation 
poisons of Mal-space, his heart 
changed and began to babble, in- 
coherently at first, just as our 
lungs are doing today. In time, 
man’s heart started speaking to 
him coherently — just as our lungs 
will do some day. And man 
decided all talking hearts would 
have to be removed. Too much 
competition for man’s talking 
minds, man said. The weave of 
the heart had become the struc- 
ture of a pump plus the tapestry 
of a thinking mind and man felt 
insecure. And man always strikes 
out whatever makes him feel 
insecure.” 

Then Lagrad’s heart would 
follow with: You dicin’ t create me. 

I was born with you. Should one 
brother kill the other? Remember 
the legend of Satan-Cain? Give 
me a chance, and you will benefit 
from my presence . 

Then Beodora would resume: 
“Just because man has been 
replacing his real heart with a 
synthetic one for over a century 
does not mean lie’s right in doing 
so. Man has blundered often in 
history. Once he believed one 
small planet was the center of 
the universe and that everything 
circled it. Once he believed he 
was very special, the only life- 
form with intelligence and love 

LIFE MATTER 


in the universe, chosen by an 
omni-creator for the honor of 
wearing Intelligence, Love and 
Blessing. The Miracle Asteroids 
of a beautiful peripatetic race now 
somewhere at the far reaches of 
the universe proved man wrong 
about that, too. Now man believes 
he should kill his talking heart. 
You and your heart are almost 
like twins, brothers, Green-eyes. 
What your heart feels and knows 
is nearly the same as what you 
feel and know.” 

You say “ Nearly the same,” 
They're not ever exactly the same? 

Not entirely the same, his heart 
would answer him. / have my 
own ego. You have yours. I feel 
you, and you feel me. I am a 
human-heart-being, you a human- 
being. If I felt only what you 
felt, I would not be trying to 
convince you of my right to go 
on living within you. Give me 
a chance, and compatability will 
come. You’ll see. 

The day finally arrived on 
which Beodora’s usual subtlety or 
reticence on the matter of mar- 
riage dissolved. 

She said, with her faraway look, 
deep, dark and beautiful, “I don’t 
think I could marry a man who 
was missing his real heart. I’m 
sure I could not, Green-eyes.” 

At this Lagrad felt frightened 
and quickly made up his mind 
against both the Operation and 
going to the New. 


103 


I t’s been four months, heart, 
since I canceled the operation, 
and you’ve been with me, speak- 
ing clearly and helpfully. You’ve 
listened, praised and compli- 
mented me when I’ve tried to raise 
the courage to propose formally 
to Beodora. You listened through 
my ears when I told my parents 
I had decided against the Opera- 
tion. You heard their anger. You 
watched through my eyes when 
I met some more of Beodora’s 
librarian friends with their heart- 
brooches, faraway looks and 
perpetually faint smiles. As you 
must know, I’m not happy, heart. 
/ worry about many things. About 
having to find work elsewhere un- 
til the Guild Directive comes 
through in a norm-year or so. I 
worry about larger matters too. 

You should not be worrying, 
his heart said firmly. There’s 
nothing really negative in your 
life. 

His heart was silent. 

1 wish you’d talk to me now, 
heart. 

His heart was formal. 

I only offer words and decisions 
when you ask for them or when 
your emotional state is such that 
you could be helped by my advice. 

Maybe so, but still I wish you'd 
give me more time to think things 
out on my. own before helping 
me with them. 

Lagrad felt tired, sad and con- 
fused. He had been walking 

104 


toward his dormitory and now, 
changing directions, he began to 
stride quickly toward the library. 
To his mind's eye his heart was 
a black entity recently suffused 
with , secrecy. The curiosity 
Lagrad felt about it was half fear, 
as he contemplated the strange 
new personality emerging from his 
heart. The dark side of the heart, 
the human heart . Perhaps, 
Lagrad considered, there were 
tapes in the library that spoke of a 
dark side. 

Beodora was working in a 
back storeroom of the library. 
Lagrad entered the library for the 
first time without her supervision 
and checked out literature tapes 
on the subject of hearts. 

In an audio-visual cubicle, 
Lagrad listened to the tapes and, 
in twenty minutes of spinning, 
crackling and speaking from the 
past, the tapes gave him the dark 
side of the heart. 

“ ... we may live without 
conscience and live without heart 
but civilized man cannot live 
without cooks; consume my heart 
away, sick with desire and locked 
on to a dying animal it knows 
not what it is; the heart is deceit- 
ful above all things and 
desperately wicked: Who can 

know it?” 

Lagrad rushed from the library, 
the dark quotations acidic on his 
mind. His heart began objecting 
loudly. 

You don’t understand . 


GALAXY 


T he rendezvous for the day was 
scheduled for 6:00 at the Ponds, 
But no, Lagrad concluded, he 
would not see Beodora today. 
He’d miss the rendezvous and wait 
for her to come to him. She had 
deceived him. She was a librarian, 
so she must have known about 
man’s distrust of his heart and 
still she hadn’t mentioned it. 

As he plodded toward his dorm 
he thought rather sarcastically, 
Heart — Aren’t you going to give 
me any advice? 

You’re being childish, Lagrad. 
You’re still brooding about the 
times I’ve tried to help you with 
suggestions. Really, Lagrad. What 
is the sense of my waiting for 
you to think a long time about 
something? When my knowledge 
and wisdom are yours, you will 
eventually arrive at the same con- 
clusions I do. 

Because I want to feel free to 
think. Only today you told me 
to plan the 6:00 meeting with 
Beodora so I could propose to 
. her. I wasn’t even given the 
chance to think about it . 

If you're so worried about your 
future employment — you really 



shouldn’t be. Things will work 
out. I still suggest you go back 
to the Ponds now and wait for 
Beodora. Propose today. 

So you still suggest it. But what 
if I don’t want to? Regardless 
of your feelings, I’m not going 
to talk to Beodora about marriage 
or anything else for that matter. 
She has deceived me . 

Lagrad walked faster toward 
his dorm. 

His heart was silent. 

Lagrad began to tremble. 

What’s happening, heart? What 
are you doing? 

I’m disturbed, Lagrad. That is 
all. 

The voice of his heart rumbled 
through him, as dark as rivers 
of oil. 

I think it’s to your best interest 
that you return to the Ponds and 
talk with Beodora. You must pro- 
pose. 

You are threatening me, heart. 
You are threatening me by mak- 
ing my body tremble. 

No. I’m disturbed, so you’re 
disturbed too. Physical functional 
reactions. 

No! You’re intimidating me, 


Edited by Lester del Rey

threatening me. I won’t stand for 
that. 

His heart boomed. 

You’re foolish, Lagrad. Do 
what I say. I’m you and you are 
me. 

That is not true. You’re always 
saying that, just like Beodora. , . 

Between flashes of pain brought 
by his heart, Lagrad thought of 
Beodora, beginning to wonder, to 
suspect. 

Return to the Bonds and talk 
to Beodora. 

No. 

S uddenly a loud rushing static 
struck Lagrad ’s mind. At once 
the quivering in his arms extended 
to all his limbs, his stomach, his 
groin. His knees buckled and the 
green grass carpet under him spun 
up to hit his face. He lay unmov- 
ing on the grass. 

Get up and go back to wait 
for her. , 

No. I’m your slave if I do. 
. both of us. All I have to 
do is stop a valve. I shall cease 
functioning. , . 

No. Not your slave. 

Then die. 

Blood, surging, softly bellow- 
ing. No — I’m not your — 

A new gush of hot energy hit, 
exploded through all the fibers 
of Lagrad’s body. A great star- 
sized light novaed somewhere 
inside him. Lagrad screamed and 
the pulp of his mind was thrown 
into darkness. 


Now you’ll go back and wait for 
Beodora . 

Lagrad the man could not hear 
his heart but his body rose on 
wobbly legs and began walking 
back to the Ponds. 

As Lagrad’s body put one foot 
ahead of the other his heart en- 
joyed its new-found control of a 
human organism. His heart now 
had legs, eyes, fingers, organs of 
its own and all was proper. 

Lagrad, the man, was aware 
of cottony grays, icy blacks and 
fire reds, as he whimpered in the 
multiple wombs of his racial un- 
conscious. At last free of those 
responsibilities of limbs and eyes, 
ears and heart, Lagrad slept, 
floating in a prenatal gelatin of 
the psyche, thinking of nothing 
but dreaming and dreaming of 
nothing but dreams. 

When Beodora stepped up to 
Lagrad in the evening mist by 
their Ponds, Lagrad’s heart looked 
with its new-found eyes into the 
faraway look in Beodora’s eyes, 
savored the thought of a marriage 
night soon to come and spoke 
with its recently conquered lips. 

Hello, Beodora. My heart is 
with you. 

Beodora P’Att’ann stared into 
Lagrad’s eyes and smiled as she 
saw their new faraway look. 

“Hello, Heart. 

My heart has always been with 
you, her heart added with lips 
mastered two years before.

ALL ISM I I 



by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

This story is not about anyone 
we like. How about you? 


107 


I do MY job, which is hoeing 
corn. But I am disturbed by 
what I hear last night from this 
Janglefoot. Me and lot of other 
people hear him. But none of the 
folk would hear. He careful not to 
say what he say to us where any 
folk would hear. It would hurt 
their feeling. 

Janglefoot he is traveling peo- 
ple. He go up and down the land. 
But he don’t go very far. He often 
back again to orate to us again. 
Although why he say it more than 
once I do not understand. He al- 
ways say the same. 

He is Janglefoot because one 
foot jangle when he walk and he 
won’t let no one fix it. It make 
him limp but he won’t let no 
one fix it. It is humility he has. 
As long as he limp and jangle 
he is humble people and he like 
humility. He think it is a virtue. 
He think that it become him. 

Smith, who is blacksmith, get 
impatient with him. Say he could 
fix the foot. Not as good as 
mechanic people, although better 
than not fixing it at all. There is a 
mechanic people not too far away. 
They impatient with him too. 
They think him putting on. 

Pure charity of Smith to offer 
fix the foot. Him have other work. 
No need to beg for it like some 
poor people do. He hammer all 
the time on metal, making into 
sheet, then send on to mechanic 
people who use it for repair. Must 
be very careful keep in good 


repair. Must do it all ourself. No 
folk left who know how to do 
it. Folk left, of course, but too 
elegant to do it. All genteel who 
left. Never work at all. 

I am hoeing corn and one of 
house people come dow'n to tell 
me there is snakes. House people 
never work outdoors. Always 
come to us. I ask real snake or 
moonshine snake and they say 
real snake. So I lean my hoe 
on tree and go up hill to house. 

Grandpa he is in hammock out 
on front lawn. Hammock is hung 
between two trees. Uncle John 
he is sitting on ground, leaning 
on one tree. Pa he is sitting on 
ground, leaning on other tree. 

Sam, say Pa, there is snake 
in back. 

So I go around house and there 
is timber rattler and I pick him 
up and he is mad at me and 
and hammer me real good. I hunt 
around and find another rattler 
and a moccasin and two garter 
snake. Garter snakes sure don’t 
amount to nothing, but I take 
them along. I hunt some more 
but that is all the snakes. 

I go down across cornfield and 
wade creek and way back into 
swamp. I turn snakes loose. Will 
take them long time to get back. 
Maybe not at all. 

Then I go back to hoeing. Im- 
portant to keep patch of com in 
shape. No weeds. Carry water 
when it needs. Soil work up nice 
and soft. Scare off crows when 


108 


GALAXY 


plant. Scare off coon and deer 
when corn come into ear. Full 
time job. for which many thanks. 
Also is important. George use 
corn to make the moon. Other 
patches of corn for food. But mine 
is use for moon. Me and George 
is partners. We make real good 
moonshine. Grandpa and Pa and 
Uncle John consume it with great 
happy. Any left over boys can 
have. But not girls. Girls don’t 
use moonshine. 

f do not understand use of food 
and booze. Grandpa say it taste 
good. I wonder what is taste. It 
make Uncle John see snakes. I 
do not understand that cither. 

I am hoeing corn when there is 
sound behind me. 1 look and 
there is Joshua. He is reading 
Bible. He always reading Bible. 
He make big job of it. Also he 
is stepping on my hills of corn. 
I yell at him and run at him. 
I hit him with the hoe. He run 
out of patch. He know why I 
hit him. I hit him before. He 
know better than stepping on the 
corn. He stand under tree and 
read. Standing in the shade. That 
is putting on. Only folk need to 
stand in shade. People don’t. 
Hitting him, I break my hoe. 
y I go to Smith to fix. Smith he 
glad to see me. Always glad to 
see each other. Smith and me are 
friend. He drop everything to fix 
hoe. Know how important corn 
is. Also do me favor. 


We talk of Janglefoot. We agree 
is wrong the way he speak. He 
speak heresy. (Smith he tell me 
that word. Joshua, once he get 
unmad at me for hitting him, look 
up how to spell. ) We agree. Smith 
and me, folk are genteel folk, not 
kind said by Janglefoot. Agree 
something should be done to 
Janglefoot. Don’t know what to 
do. We say we think more of 
it. 

George come by. Say he need 
me. Folk out of drinking likker. 
So I go with him while Smith 
is fixing hoe. George he has nice 
still, real neat and clean. Good 
capacity. Also try hard to age 
moonshine but never able to. Folk 
use it up too fast. He have four 
five-gallon jugs. We each take two • 
and walk to house. 

We stop at hammock where 
three still are. Tell us leave one 
jug there, take three to woodshed, 
put away, bring back some 
glasses. We do. We pour out 
glasses of moonshine for Grandpa 
and Pa. Uncle John he says never, 
mind no glass for him, just put 
jug beside him. We do, leaving 
it uncork. Uncle John reach in 
pocket and bring out little rubber 
hose. Put one end in jug, other 
end in ruouth. He lean back 
against tree and start sucking. 

They make elegant picture-. ' 
Grandpa look peaceful. Rocking 
in hammock with big glass of 
moon balance on his chest. We ■ 
happy to see them happy. We

go back to work. Smith has hoe 
fix and very sharp. It handle good. 
J thank him. 

He say he still confuse at 
Janglefoot. Janglefoot claim he 
read what he say. In old record. 
Found record in old city far away. 
Smith ask if I know what city 
is. I say I don’t. We more confuse 
than ever. For that matter, don't 
know what record is. Sound im- 
portant, though. 

I am hoeing corn when the 
Preacher pass and stop. Joshua 
gone somewhere. 1 tell him should 
have come sooner, Joshua stand- 
ing under tree, reading Bible. He 
say Joshua only reading Bible, 
he interpret it. I ask him what 
interpret is. He tell me. 1 ask 
him how to spell it. He tell me. 
He know I try to write. He is 
helpful people. But pompous. 

Night come on and moon is 
late to rise. Can no longer hoe 
for lack of seeing. So lean hoe 
against tree. Go to still to help 
George now making moonshine. 
George is glad of help. He running 
far behind. 

I wonder to him why Jangle- 
foot say same thing over and over. 
He say is repetition. T ask him 
repetition. He not sure. Say he 
think you say thing often enough 
people will believe it. Say folk 
use it in olden day. Make other 
folk believe thing that isn’t so. 

I ask him what he know of 
olden day. He say not very much. 

110 


He say he should remember, but 
he doesn’t. I should remember 
too, but I can’t remember. Too 
long ago. Too much happen since. 
It is not important except for what 
Janglefoot is saying. 

George has good fire burning 
under still and it shine on us. 
We stand around and watch. 
Make good feeling in the gizzard. 
Owl talk long way off in swamp. 
Do not know why fire feel good. 
No need of warm. Do not know 
why owl make one feel lonesome. 
I no lonesome. Got George right 
here beside me. There is so many 
things I do not know. What city 
is or record. What taste is. What 
olden day is like. Happy, though. 
Do not need to understand for 
happy. 

People come from house, run- 
ning fast. Say Uncle John is sick. 
Say he need doctor. Say he no 
longer seeing snakes. Seeing now 
blue alligator. With bright pink 
spots. Uncle John must be awful 
sick. Is no blue alligator. Not with 
bright pink spots. 

George say he go to house to 
help, me run for Doc. George 
and house people leave, going 
very fast. I leave for Doc, also 
going fast. 

Finally find Doc in swamp. He 
has candle lantern and is digging 
root. He always digging root. 
Great one for root and bark. He 
make stuff out of them for repair- 
ing folk. He is folk mechanic. 

He standing in muck, up to

knee. He cover with mud. He is 
filthy people. But he feel bad, 
hearing Uncle John is sick. Do 
not like blue alligator. Next he 
say is purple elephant and that 
is worst of all. 

We run, both of us. I hold 
lantern at alligator hole while Doc 
wash mud off him. Never do to 
let folk seeing him filthy. We go 
to hut where Doc keep root and 
bark. He get some of it and we 
run for house. Moon has come 
up now, but we keep lantern. It 
help moonlight some. 

W E come to foot of hill with 
house on top of hill. All lawn 
between foot of- hill and house. 
All lawn except for trees that hold 
up hammock. Hammock still is 
there, but empty. It blow back 
and forth in breeze. House stand 
up high and white. Windows in 
it shining. 

Grandpa sit on big long porch 
that is in front of house, with 
white pillars to hold up roof. He 
sit in rocking chair. He rock back 
and forth. Another rocking chair 
beside him. He is only one 
around. Can see no one else. 
Inside of house women folk is 
making cries. Through tall win- 
dow I can see inside. Big thing 
house people call chandelier hang 
from ceiling. Made of glass. Many 
candles in it. Candles all are 
burning. Glass look pretty in light. 
Furniture in room gleam with 
light. All is clean and polish. 

I AM CRYING ALL INSIDE 


House people work hard to keep 
it clean and polish. Take big 
pride. 

We run up steps to porch. 

Grandpa say, you come too 
late. My son John is dead. 

I do not understand this dead. 
When folk dead put them into 
ground. Say words over them. Put 
big stone at their head. Back of 
house is special place for dead. 
Lot of big stones standing there. 
Some new. Some old. Some so 
old cannot read lettering that say 
who is under them. 

Doc run into house. To make 
sure Grandpa say right, perhaps. 
1 stay on porch, unknowing what 
to do. Feel terrible sad. Don’t 
know why I do. Except knowing 
dead is bad. Maybe because 
Grandpa seem so sad. 

Grandpa say to me, Sam sit 
down and talk. 

I do not sit, I tell him. People 
always stand. 

It was outrage of him to ask 
it. He know custom. He know 
as well as I do people do not 
sit with folk. 

God damn it to hell, he say, 
forget your stubborn pride. Sitting 
is not bad. I do it all the time. 
Bend yourself and sit. 

In that chair, he say, pointing 
to one beside him. 

I look at chair. I wonder will 
it hold me. It is built for folk. 
People heavier than folk. Have 
no wish to break a chair with 
weight. Take much time to make

one. Carpenter people work for 
long to make one. 

But I think no skin off my 
nose. Skin off Grandpa’s nose. 
He the one that tell me. 

So I square around so I hit 
the chair and bend myself and 
sit. Chair creak, but hold. T settle 
into it. Sitting feel good. 1 rock 
a little. Rocking feel good. 

Grandpa and me sit, looking out 
on lawn. Lawn is real pretty. 
Moonlight on it. First lawn and 
then some trees and after trees 
cornfield and other fields. Far 
away owl talk in swamp. Coon 
whicker. Fox bark long way off. 

It do beat hell, say Grandpa, 
how man can live out his life, 
doing nothing, then die of 
moonshine drinking. 

You sure of moon, I ask. I 
hate to hear Grandpa blaming 
moonshine. George and me, we 
make real good moonshine. 

, Grandpa say, it couldn’t be 
nothing else. Only moonshine give 
blue ' alligator with bright pink 
spots. 

No purple elephant, so say 
Grandpa. 

t i wonder what elephant might 
be. So much that I don't know. 

Sam, say Grandpa, we a sorry 
lot. Never had no chance. Neither 
you nor us. Ain’t none of us no 
good 7 . We folk sit around all day 
and never do a thing. Hunt a 
little, maybe. Fish a little. Play 
cards. Drink likker. Feel real 
Energetic, maybe I’ll play some

horseshoe. Should be out doing 
something good and big. But we 
never are. While we live we don’t 
amount to nothing. When we die 
we don’t amount to nothing. 
We’re just no God damn good. 

He went on rocking, bitter. I 
don’t like the way he talk. He 
feel bad, sure, but no excuse to 
talk the way he was. Elegant folk 
like him shouldn’t talk that way. 
Lay in hammock all day long, 
shouldn’t talk that way. Balance 
moonshine on his chest, shouldn’t 
talk that way. I uncomfortable. 
Wish to get away, but impolite 
to leave. 

i 

D own at bottom of hill, where 
lawn begin, 1 see many people. 
Standing, looking up at house. 
Pretty soon come slow up lawn 
and look closer at house. Saying 
nothing, just standing. Paying 
their respect. Letting folk know 
that they sorrow too. 

We never was nothing but white 
trash, say Grandpa. I can see it 
now. Seen it for long, long time 
but could never say it. I can say 
it now. We live in swamp in 
houses falling down. Falling down 
because we got no gumption to 
take care of them. Hunt and fish 
a little. Trap a little. Farm a little. 
Sit around and cuss because we 
ain't got nothing. 

Grandpa, I say. I want him 
to stop. I don’t want to hear. 
Don’t want him to go on saying 
.what Janglefoot been saying. 

GALAXY 


But he pay me no attention. 
He go on saying. 

Then, long, long ago, he say, 
they learn to go in space very, 
very fast. Faster than the light. 
Much faster than the light. They 
find other worlds. Better than the 
Earth. Much better worlds than 
this. Lot of ships to go in. Take 
little time to go there. So 
everybody go. Everyone but us. 
Folk like us, all over the world, 
are left behind. Smart ones go. 
Rich ones go. Hard workers go. 
We are left behind. We aren’t 
worth the taking. No one want 
us on this world. Have no use 
for us on others. They leave us 
behind, the misfits, the loafers, 
the poor, the crippled, the stupid. 
All over the world these kind are 
left behind. So when they all are 
gone, we move from shacks to 
houses the rich and smart ones 
lived in. No one to stop us from 
doing it. All of them are gone. 
They don’t care what we do. Not 
any more they don’t. We live in 
better houses, but we do not 
change. There is no use to change 
even if we could. We got you 
to take care of us. We have got 
it made. We don’t do a God damn 
thing. We don’t even learn to 
read. When words are read over

not going to be fought, at least not on 
the Berkley list. Our approach to SF 
is and will be mercilessly eclectic, 
looking only for books the reader will 
want to read— and will be glad to have 
read. We’re doing SF by Wells, Hein-

it now. He had took away the 
elegant. Took away the pride. He 
do what Janglefoot never could. 

Now, say Grandpa, don’t take 
on that way. You got no reason 
to be prideful either. You and 
us we are the same. Just no God 
damn good. There were others 
of you and they took them along. 
But you they left behind. Be- 
cause you were out of date. Be- 
cause you were slow and 
awkward. Because you were heaps 
of junk. Because they had no need 
of you. They wouldn’t give you 
room. They left both you and 
us because neither of us was 
worth the room we took. 

Doc came out of door fast and 
purposeful. He say to me I got 
work for you to do. 

All the other people coming up 
the lawn, saying nothing, slow. 
I try to get out of chair. I can’t. 
For first time I can’t do what 
I want. My legs is turned to water. 

Sam, say Grandpa, I am count- 
ing on you. 

When he say that, I get up. 
I go down steps. I go out on 
lawn. No need for Doc tell me 
what to do. I done it all befofe. 

I talk to other people. I give 
jobs to do. You and you dig 
grave. You and you make coffin. 
You and you and you and you 
run to other houses. Tell all the 
folk Uncle John is dead. Tell them 
come to funeral. Tell them funeral 
elegant. Much to cry, much to

eat, much to drink. You get 
Preacher. Tell him fix sermon. 
You get Joshua to read the Bible. 
You and you and you go and help 
George make moonshine. Other 
folk be coming. Must be elegant. 

All done. I walk down the 
lawn. I think on pride and loss. 
Elegant is gone. Shiny wonder 
gone. Pride is gone. Not all pride, 
however. Kind of pride remain. 
Hard and bitter pride. Grandpa 
say Sam sit down and talk. 
Grandpa say Sam I counting on 
you. That is pride. Hard pride. 
Not soft and easy pride like it 
was before. Grandpa need me. 

No one else will know. 
Grandpa never bring himself again 
to tell what he tell me. Secret 
between us. Secret born of sad. 
Life of others need not change. 
Go on thinking same. Janglefoot 
no trouble. No one believe 
Janglefoot if he talk forever. No 
one ever know that he tell the 
truth. Truth is hard to take. No 
one care except for what we have 
right now. We go on same. 

Except I who know. I never 
want to know. I never ask to 
know. I try not to know. But 
Grandpa won’t shut up. Grandpa 
have to talk. Time come man will 
die if he cannot talk. Must make 
clean breast of it. But why to 
me? Because he love me most, 
perhaps. That is prideful thing.

space probe to Jupiter have just 
been published in West German 
technical journals. The mission to 
Jupiter is meant to become a pro- 
ject of ESRO (European Space 
Research Organization), possibly 
in cooperation with NASA. 

Since Jupiter orbits the sun at 
a distance of 483.3 million miles 
(or 5.2 times as far as the earth 
is from the sun) this is quite 
an ambitious project. But the 
Europeans have to think up am- 
bitious or at least novel projects, 


just because they have done so 
little in space so far. Everything 
“obvious,” like sending space 
probes to the moon and to the 
neighboring planets Venus and 
Mars has been done by the United 
States as well as by the Soviet 
Union. It would be difficult to 
think up an earth-orbiting satellite 
that can do something that has 
not been done by existing Ameri- 
can, British, Canadian, French or 
Russian satellites. 

Of course there are still a num- 
ber of possibilities. One could 
send a space probe sunward to 
take up a reasonably circular orbit 
around the sun at a distance of 
about 1 1 million miles. Such an 
orbit would make the probe

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 






Dune was an arid planet, 
inhabited by gigantic sandworms 
and wild Fremen whose customs 
were based on water scarcity. Its 
onlf useful product was melange, 
an addictive drug produced by the 
worms. This “spice” somehow 
aided longevity and gave an adept 
visions of the future. 

PAUL ATRE1DES, scion of a 
noble house, was dumped into the 
desert after the murder of his 
father. With the young boy was 
his pregnant mother, the LADY 
JESSICA, who had been trained 
in the arts of the Bene Gesserit — a 
female order devoted to mental 
discipline and the control of hu- 
man genetic lines to produce a 
“ kwisatz haderach,” a messiah 
capable of fully using extrasensory 
powers. Under t' ^ir training, Paul 
was supposed to _ them to 
this ideal. 

In learning to live with the Fre- 
men, Paul was forced to take an 
overdose of spice in one of their 
rituals. He emerged with amazing 
knowledge of the future — or 
futures. The Lady Jessica also 
took an overdose, with the result 
that ALIA, Paul’s sister, was born 
with full knowledge of all her 
mother had known. ' : 

Paul rose to leadership and 
eventually led the Fremen against 
his ancient enemies, the Harkon- 
nen rulers and their Sardaukar 
soldiers. In a bitter battle during 
which his friend and teacher, 
DUNCAN IDAHO, was killed. 




117 


Paul defeated them. He became 
ruler, taking the Harkonnen heir, 
PRINCESS IRULAN, as his con- 
sort. But he refused to consum- 
mate the marriage, remaining with 
his desert mate, the Fremen wo- 
man CHANI. 

Now, twelve years later, Paul 
rules a mighty empire of stars 
and has become the god-like cen- 
ter of a religion built around his 
visions and the legends growing 
out of it. This Qizarate is the 
official religion of all his empire. 
And against it the other quasi- 
political, quasi-religious forces of 
humanity have just begun to 
organize. 

Among these is the Bene 
Gesserit, which is headed by the 
Reverend Mother G A I U S 
HELEN MOHIAM. They have 
lost control of Paul and his 
mother and must depend on the 
weak help of their trainee, 
Princess Irulan. Allied with them 
more or less is the Bene Tleilax, 
supposedly amoral scientists; the 
Tleilaxu representing them is 
SCYTALE, a “face dancer” who 
can shape himself to look like any 
man or woman. These two groups 
have enlisted the aid of the Spac- 
ing Guild, which must control the 
melange trade, since only spice 
visions permit navigating between 
the stars. The Guild is represented 
by EDRIC, a Steersman who is 
more fishlike than human and 
must live in a tank. His main 
function now is to use his own 
touch against the future to 
obscure Paul's vision so their 
plotting will not be detected. 

Princess Irulan is sent back to 

118 


Paul, instructed to keep giving 
Chani a drug that induces sterility 
and to seduce Paul into giving 
her an heir — something she 

desperately wants. Chani advises 
Paul to give in to her. But Paul 
refuses. He is bitter and disturbed, 
troubled by his visions which are 
uncertain but indicate that he may 
be the very instrument of doom 
which he is trying to avoid for 
the future. He is sure, however, 
that having an heir to the throne 
by Irulan will destroy all his 
hopes. 

The conspirators send a ship 
to Paul’s Keep on the plains of 
Arakeen. Paul quickly detects, the 
presence of the Reverend Mother 
Mohiam on board and has her 
arrested. But there are others on 
the ship. Scytale has also come, 
along with BIJAZ , a mutant dwarf 
who is the product of Tleilaxu 
life science. 

Scytale secretly visits a Fremen 
who once served in Paul’s army 
but is now old and bitter. From 
the old man, Scytale learns all 
he can. Then he betrays the Fre- 
men and makes off with a girl 
from the neighborhood who has 
been brain-burned and addicted 
to the semuta drug. 

Meantime, Edric remains with 
his ship. He offers Paul a present 
from the Guild. 

The present is something of a 
shock. It looks rather like Duncan 
Idaho — alive and unharmed, save 
that his eyes have been replaced 
by metal ones. Edric says it is 
a ghola — a product of Tleilaxu 
genius. The body of Idaho was 
rescued and carefully regrown 

GALAXY 


from its cell patterns, though all 
memories vanished with death. 

Paul is disturbed by HAYT, 
as the ghola is now named. He 
cannot understand why his visions 
had showed no Duncan Idaho in 
his future. He asks the ghola, who 
answers quite candidly. “I have 
been sent to destroy you.” 

But the ghola does hot know 
how. He tells Paul to send him 
away — but Paul cannot do that 
to what had once been so close 
to him. 

VI 

Truth suffers from too much 
analysis. 

— Ancient Fremen Saying 

EVEREND MOTHER, I sigh tO 
A see you in such circum- 
stances,” Irulan said. 

She stood just inside the cell 
door, measuring with care the 
various capacities of the room in 
her Bene Gesserit way. It was a 
three-meter cube carved with cut- 
terays from the veined brown rock 
beneath Paul’s Keep. For fur- 
nishings, it contained one flimsy 
basket chair occupied now by the 
Reverend Mother Gaius Helen 
Mohiam, a pallet with a brown 
cover upon which had been spread 
a deck of the new Dune tarot 
cards, a metered water tap above 
a reclamation basin and a Fremen 
privy with moisture seals. It was 
all sparse, primitive. Yellow light 
came from anchored and caged 
glowglobes at the four corners of 
the ceiling. 

“You’ve sent word to the Lady 

DUNE MESSIAH 


Jessica?” the Reverend Mother 
asked. 

“Yes, but I don’t expect her 
to lift one finger against her 
firstborn,” Irulan said. She glanc- 
ed at the cards. They spoke of 
the powerful turning their backs 
on supplicants. The card of the 
Great Worm lay beneath Desolate 
Sand. Patience was counseled. Did 
one require the tarot to see this? 
she asked herself. 

A guard stood outside watching 
them through a metaglass window 
in the door. Irulan knew there’d 
be other monitors on this en- 
counter. She had put in much 
thought and planning before dar- 
ing to come here. To have stayed 
away carried its own perils, 
though. 

The Reverend Mother had been 
engaged in prajna meditation in- 
terspersed with examinations of 
the tarot. Despite a feeling that 
she would never leave Arrakis 
alive, she had achieved a measure 
of calm through this. One’s 
oracular powers might be small, 
but muddy water was muddy 
water. And there was always the 
Litany against Fear. 

She had yet to assimilate the 
import of the actions which had 
precipitated her into this cell. 
Dark suspicions brooded in her 
mind and the tarot hinted at con- 
firmations. Was it possible the 
Guild had planned this? 

A yellow-robed Qizara, head 
shaved for a turban, beady eyes 
of total blue in a bland round 
face, skin leathered by the wind 
and sun of Arrakis, had awaited 
her on the heighliner’s reception 

119 


bridge. He had looked up from 
a bulb of spice coffee being served 
by an obsequious steward, studied 
her a moment, put down the cof- 
fee bulb. 

“You are the Reverend Mother 
Gaius Helen Mohiam?” 

To replay those words in her 
mind was to bring that moment 
alive in the memory. Her throat 
had constricted with an un- 
manageable spasm of fear. How 
had one of the Emperor’s minions 
learned of her presence on the 
heighliner? 

“It came to our attention that 
you were aboard,’’ the Qizara 
said. “Have you forgotten that 
you are denied permission to set 
foot on the holy planet?” 

“I am not on Arrakis,” she 
said. “I’m a passenger on a Guild 
heighliner in free space.” 

“There is no such thing as free 
space, Madame.” 

She read hate mingled with 
profound suspicion in his tone. 

“Muad’dib rules everywhere,” 
he said. 

“Arrakis is not my destina- 
tion.” she insisted. 

“Arrakis is the destination of 
everyone,” he said. And she 
feared for a moment that he 
would launch into a recital of 
the mystical itinerary which 
pilgrims followed. This very ship 
had carried thousands of them. 

B ut the Quizara had pulled a 
golden amulet from beneath his 
robe, kissed it, touched it to his 
forehead and placed it to his right 
ear to listen. Presently, he restored 
the amulet to its hidden place. 

120 


“You are ordered to gather 
your luggage and accompany me 
to Arrakis.” 

“But I do have other business 
elsewhere!” 

In that moment, she suspected 
Guild perfidy ... or exposure 
through some transcendant power 
of the Emperor or his sister. 
Perhaps the Steersman did not 
conceal the conspiracy, after all. 
The abomination, Alia, certainly 
possessed the abilities of a Bene 
Gesserit Reverend Mother. What 
happened when those powers were 
coupled with the forces which 
worked in her brother? 

“At once!” the Qizara snapped. 

Everything in her cried out 
against setting foot once more oh 
that accursed desert planet. Here 
was where the Lady Jessica had 
turned against the Sisterhood. 
Here was where they’d lost Paul 
Atreides, the kwisatz haderach 
they had sought through many 
long generations of careful breed- 
ing. 

“At once,” she agreed. 

“There’s little time,” the Qizara 
said. “When the Emperor com- 
mands, all his subjects obey.” 

So the order had come from 
Paid ! 

She thought of protesting rather 
vigorously to the heighliner’s 
Navigator-Commander but the 
futility of such a gesture stopped 
her. What could the Guild do? 

“The Emperor has said I must 
die if I set foot on Dune,” she 
said, making a last desperate ef- 
fort. “You spoke of this yourself. 
You are condemning me if you 
take me down there.” 


GALAXY 


“Say no more,” the Qizara or- 
dered. "The thing is ordained.” 
That was how they always 
spoke of Imperial commands, she 
knew. Ordained! The holy ruler 
whose eyes could pierce the future 
had spoken. What must be must 
be. He had seen it, had He not? 

With the sick feeling that she 
was caught in a web of her own 
spinning, she had turned to obey. 

And the web had become a 
cell which lrulan could visit. She 
suddenly saw that lrulan had aged 
somewhat since their meeting on 
Wallach IX. New lines of worry 
spread from the corners of her 
eyes. Well . time to see if this 
Sister of the Bene Gesserit could 
obey her vows. 

“I’ve had worse quarters,” the 
Reverend Mother said. “Do you 
come from the Emperor?” And 
she allowed her fingers to move 
as though in agitation. 

lrulan read the moving fingers 
and her own fingers flashed an 
answer as she spoke, saying: 
“No — I came as soon as 1 heard 
.you were here.” 

“Won't the Emperor be angry?” 
the Reverend Mother questioned 
her. Again, her fingers moved: 
imperative, pressing, demanding. 

“Let him be angry. You were 
my teacher in the Sisterhood, just 
- as you were the teacher of his 
own mother. Does he think I will 
turn my back on you as she has 
done?” And Irulan’s finger-talk 
made excuses, begged. 

T he Reverend Mother sighed. 

On the surface, it was the sigh 
of a prisoner bemoaning her fate, 

DUNE MESSIAH 


but inwardly she felt the response 
as a comment on lrulan. It was 
futile to hope the Atreides Em- 
peror’s precious gene pattern 
could be preserved through this 
instrument. No matter her beauty, 
this Princess was flawed. Under 
that veneer of sexual attraction 
lived a whining shrew more in- 
terested in words than in actions, 
lrulan was still a Bene Gesserit, 
though, and the Sisterhood had 
always reserved certain techniques 
to use on some of its weaker 
vessels as insurance that vital 
instructions would be carried out. 

Beneath small talk about a soft- 
er pallet and better food, the 
Reverend Mother brought up her 
arsenal of persuasion and gave 
her orders: the brother-sister 

crossbreeding must be explored. 

lrulan almost broke at receiving 
this command. “I must have my 
chance!” Irulan’s fingers pleaded. 

“You’ve had your chance,” the 
Reverend Mother countered. And 
she was explicit in her instruc- 
tions: Was the Emperor ever 

angry with his concubine? His 
unique powers must make him 
lonely. To whom could he speak 
in any hope of being understood? 
To the sister, obviously. They 
shared this loneliness. The depth 
of their communion must be ex- 
ploited. Opportunities must be 
created to throw them together 
in privacy. Intimate encounters 
must be arranged, The possibility 
of eliminating the concubine niust 
be explored. Grief somehow 
dissolved, traditional barriers. 

lrulan protested. If Ghani were 

121 


killed, suspicion would fall im- 
mediately upon the Princess- 
Consort. Besides, there were other 
problems. Chani had fastened 
upon an ancient Fremen diet sup- 
posed to promote fertility and the 
diet eliminated all opportunity for 
administering the contraceptive 
drugs. Lifting the suppressives 
would make Chani even more fer- 
tile. 

The Reverend Mother was 
outraged and concealed it with 
difficulty while her fingers flashed 
their demands. Why had this in- 
formation not been conveyed at 
the beginning of their conversa- 
tion? How could Irulan be that 
stupid? If Chani conceived and 
bore a son, the Emperor would 
• declare the child his heir! 

Irulan protested that she un- 
derstood the dangers, but the 
genes might not be totally lost. 

Damn such stupidity! the 
Reverend Mother raged. Who 
knew exactly what suppressions 
and genetic entanglements Chani 
might introduce from her wild 
Fremen strain? The Sisterhood 
must have only the pure line! And 
an heir would renew Paul’s ambi- 
tions, spur him to new efforts in 
consolidating his Empire. The 
conspiracy could not afford such a 
setback. 

Defensively, Irulan wanted to 
know how she could have pre- 
vented Chani from trying this 
diet? 

But the Reverend Mother was 
in no mood for excuses. Irulan 
received explicit instructions now 
to meet this new threat. If Chani 
conceived, an abortifact must be 

122 


introduced into her food or drink. 
Either that, or she must be killed. 
An heir to the throne from that 
source must be prevented at all 
costs. 

An abortifact would be as 
dangerous as an open attack on 
the concubine, Irulan objected. 
She trembled at the thought of 
trying to kill Chani. 

Was Irulan deterred by danger? 
The Reverend Mother wanted to 
know, her finger-talk conveying 
deep scorn. 

Angered, Irulan signaled that 
she knew her value as an agent 
in the royal household. Did the 
conspiracy wish to waste su.ch a 
valuable agent? Was she to be 
thrown away? In what other way 
could they keep this close a watch 
on the Emperor? Or had they 
introduced another agent into the 
household? Was that it? Was she 
to be used now, desperately, and 
for the last time? 

I N a war, all values acquired 
new relationships, the Reverend 
Mother countered. Their greatest 
peril was that House Atreides 
should secure itself with an Im- 
perial line. The Sisterhood could 
not take such a risk. This went 
far beyond the danger to the 
Atreides genetic pattern. Let Paul 
anchor his family to the throne 
and the Sisterhood could look 
forward to centuries of disruption 
for its programs. 

Irulan understood the argu- 
ment, but she couldn’t escape the 
thought that a decision had been 
made to spend the Princess- 
Consort for something of great 

GALAXY 


value. Was there something she 
should know about the ghola? 

The Reverend Mother wanted 
to know if Irulan thought the 
Sisterhood composed of fools. 
When had they ever failed to tell 
Irulan all she should know? 

It was no answer, but an ad- 
mission of concealment, Irulan 
saw. It said she would be told 
no more than she needed to know. 

How could they be certain the 
ghola was capable of destroying 
the Emperor? 

She could just as well have 
asked if melange were capable of 
destruction, the Reverend Mother 
countered. 

It was a rebuke with a subtle 
message, Irulan soon realized. For 
the Bene Gesserit “whip that 
instructs” informed her that she 
should have understood long ago 
this similarity between the spice 
and the ghola. Melange was 
valuable, but it exacted a 
price — addiction. It added years 
to a life — decades for some — but 
it was still just another way to die. 

The ghola was something of 
deadly value. 

The obvious way to prevent an 
unwanted birth was to kill the 
prospective mother before con- 
ception, the Reverend Mother 
signaled, returning to the attack. 

Of course, Irulan thought. If 
you decide to spend a certain sum, 
get as much for it as you can. 

The Reverend Mother’s eyes, 
dark with the blue brilliance of 
her melange addiction, stared up 
at Irulan, measuring, waiting, 
observing minutiae. 

She reads me clearly, Irulan 

DUNE MESSIAH 


1 


thought with dismay. She trained 
me and observed me in that 
training. She knows 1 realize what 
decision has been taken here. She 
only observes now to see how 
I will take this knowledge. Well, 
I will take it as a Bene Gesserit 
and a princess. 

Irulan managed a smile, pulled 
herself erect and thought of the 
evocative opening passage of the 
Litany Against Fear — 

“I must not fear. Fear is the 
mind-killer. Fear is the little-death 
that brings total obliteration. I will 
face my fear ...” 

When calmness had returned, 
she thought: Let them spend me. 
/ will show them what a princess 
is worth. Perhaps Fll buy them 
more than they expected. 

After • a few more empty 
vocalizations to bind off the in- 
terview, Irulan departed. 

When she had gone, the 
Reverend Mother returned to her 
tarot cards, laying them out in 
the familiar fire-eddy pattern. Im- 
mediately, she got the Kwisatz 
Haderach of the Major Arcana 
and the card lay coupled with the 
Eight of Ships: the sybil hood- 
winked and betrayed. These were 
not cards of good omen: they 
spoke of concealed resources for 
her enemies. 

She turned away from the 
cards, sat in agitation, wondering 
if Irulan might yet destroy them. 

VII 

The Fremen see her as the 
Earth Figure, a demi-goddess 
whose special charge is to protect 

123 


the tribes through her powers of 
violence. She is Reverend Mother 
to their Reverend Mothers. 1 o 
Pilgrims who seek her out with 
demands that she restore virility 
or make the barren fruitful, she 
is a form of antimentat. She feeds 
on that strong human desire for 
the mysterious. She is living proof 
that the “ analytic ” has limits. She 
represents ultimate tension. She 
is the virgin-harlot — witty, vulgar, 
cruel, as destructive in her whims 
as a coreolis storm. 

— St. Alia of the Knife 
as taken from tire Irulan report. 

A ua stood like a black-robed 
sentinel figure on the south 
platform of her temple, the Fane 
of the Oracle which Paul’s Fre- 
men cohorts had built for her 
against a wall of his stronghold. 

She hated this part of her life, 
but knew no way to evade the 
temple without bringing down 
destruction upon them all. The 
Pilgrims (damn them! ) grew more 
numerous every day. 1 he temple s 
lower porch was crowded with 
them. Vendors moved among the 
Pilgrims, and there were minor 
sorcerers, haruspices and diviners, 
all working their trade in pitiful 
imitation of Paul Muad dib and 
his sister. 

Red and green packages con- 
taining the new Dune tarot were 
prominent among the vendors 
■ wares, Alia saw. She wondered 
about the tarot. Who was feeding 
this into the Arrakeen market? 
Why had the tarot come to prom- 
inence at this particular time 
and place? Could it be to muddy 

124 


Time? Spice addiction always 
conveyed some sensitivity to pre- 
diction. Fremen were notoriously 
fey. Was it an accident that so 
many of them dabbled in portents 
and omens here and now? She 
decided to seek an answer at the 
first opportunity. 

There was a wind from the 
southeast, a small leftover wind 
blunted by the scarp of the Shield 
Wall which loomed high in these 
northern reaches. The rim glowed 
orange through a thin dust haze 
underlighted by the late afternoon 
sun. It was a hot wind against 
her cheeks and it made her 
homesick for the sand, for .the 
security of open spaces. 

The last of the day’s mob began 
descending the broad greenstone 
steps of "the lower porch, singly 
and in groups, a few pausing to 
stare at the keepsakes and holy 
amulets on the street vendors’ 
racks, some consulting one last 
minor sorcerer. Pilgrims, suppli- 
cants, townfolk, Fremen, vendors 
closing up for the day — they 
formed a straggling line that trail- 
ed off into the palm-lined avenue 
which led to the heart of the city. 

Alia’s eyes picked out the Fre- 
men, marking the frozen looks 
of superstitious awe on their faces, 
the half wild way they kept their 
distance from the others. They 
were her strength and her peril. 
They still captured giant worms 
for transport, for sport and for 
sacrifice. They resented the off- 
world Pilgrims, barely tolerated 
the townfolk of graben and pan, 
hated the cynicism they saw in 
the street vendors. One did not 

GALAXY 


jostle a wild Fremen, even in a 
mob such as the ones which 
swarmed to Alia’s Fane. There 
were no knifings in the Sacred 
Precincts, but bodies had been 
found . later. 

T he departing swarm had stir- 
red up dust. The flinty odor 
came to Alia’s nostrils, igniting 
another pang of longing for the 
open bled. Her sense of the past, 
she realized, had been sharpened 
by the coming of the ghola. 
There’d been much pleasure in 
those untrammeled days before her 
brother had mounted the throne — 
time for joking, time for small 
things, time to enjoy a cool morn- 
ing or a sunset, time. .time. 
time. Even danger had been 
good in those days — clean danger 
from known sources. No need 
then to strain the limits of pre- 
science, to peer through murky 
veils for frustrating glimpses of 
the future. 

Wild Fremen said it well: 
“Four things cannot be hid- 
den — love, smoke, a pillar of fire 
and a man striding across the 
open bled.” 

With an abrupt feeling of 
revulsion. Alia retreated from the 
platform into the shadows of the 
Fane and strode along the balcony 
which looked down into the 
glistening opalescence of her Hall 
of Oracles. Sand on the tiles 
rasped beneath her feet. Suppli- 
cants always tracked sand into 
the Sacred Chambers! She ignored 
attendants, guards, postulants and 

DUNE MESSIAH 


the Qizarate’s omnipresent priest- 
sycophants, and plunged into the 
spiral passage which twisted up- 
ward to her private quarters. 
There, amidst divans, deep rugs, 
tent hangings and mementos of 
the desert, she dismissed the Fre- 
men amazons Stilgar had assigned 
as her own personal guardians. 
Watchdogs, more likely! When 
they had gone, muttering and ob- 
jecting, but more fearful of her 
than they were of Stilgar, she 
stripped off her robe, leaving only 
the sheathed crysknife on its thong 
around her neck, strewed gar- 
ments behind as she made for 
her bath. 

He was near, she knew — that 
shadow-figure of a man she could 
sense in her future, but could not 
see. It angered her that no power 
of prescience could put flesh on 
that figure. He could be sensed 
only at unexpected moments while 
she scanned the lives of others. 
Or she came upon a smoky 
outline in solitary darkness when 
innocence lay coupled with desire. 
He stood just beyond an unfixed 
horizon, and she felt that if she 
strained her talents to an unex- 
pected intensity she might see 
him. He was there — a constant 
assault on her awareness: fierce, 
dangerous, immoral. 

Moist warm air surrounded her 
in the bath. Here was a habit 
she had learned from the memory- 
entities of all the many uncounted 
Reverend Mothers who were 
hazily strung out in her awareness 
like pearls on a glowing necklace. 
Water, warm water in a sunken 
tub, accepted her skin as she slid 

125 


into it. Green tiles with figures of 
red fish worked into a sea pattern 
surrounded the water. Such an 
abundance of water occupied this 
space that a Fremen of old would 
have been outraged to see it used 
merely for washing human flesh. 

He was near. 

It was lust in tension with 
chastity, she thought. Her flesh 
desired a mate. Sex held no casual 
mystery for a Reverend Mother 
who had presided at the sietch 
orgies. The tau awareness of her 
other-selves could supply any de- 
tail her curiosity required. This 
feeling of nearness could be 
nothing other than flesh reaching 
for flesh. 

Need for action fought lethargy 
in the warm water. 

A bruptly, Alia climbed dripping 
from the bath and strode wet and 
naked into the training chamber 
which adjoined her bedroom. The 
chamber, oblong and skylighted, 
contained the gross and subtle 
instruments which toned a Bene 
Gesserit adept into what was 
a complete physical and mental 
awareness/preparedness. There 
were many mnemnonic amplifiers, 
digit mills from lx to strengthen 
and sensitize fingers and toes, 
odor synthesizers, t a c t i 1 i t y 
sensitizers, temperature gradient 
fields, pattern betrayers to prevent 
her falling into detectable habits, a

blink-synchronizers to tone abili- 
ties in analysis. 

In ten-centimeter letters along 
one wall, written by her own hand 
in mnemonic paint, stood the key

reminder from the Bene Gesserit 
creed : 

“Before us, all methods of 
learning were tainted by instinct. 
We learned how to learn. Before 
us, those instinct-ridden re- 
searchers possessed a very limited 
attention span — often no longer 
than a single lifetime. Projects 
stretching across fifty or more 
lifetimes never occurred to them. 
The concept of total muscle/ 
nerve training had not entered 
awareness.” 

As she moved into the training 
room. Alia caught her own reflec- 
tion multiplied thousands of times 
in the crystal prisms of a fending 
mirror swinging in the heart of 
a target dummy. She saw the long 
sword waiting on its brackets 
against the target, and she 
thought: Yes! I’ll work myself 

to exhaustion — drain the flesh and 
clear the mind. 

The sword felt right in her 
hand. She slipped the crysknite 
from its sheath at her neck, held 
it sinister and tapped the activat- 
ing stud with the sword tip. 
Resistance came alive as the auta 
of the target shield built up, 
pushing her weapon away. 

Prisms glittered. And the target 
slipped to her left. 

Alia followed with the tip of 
the long blade, thinking as she 
often did that the thing could 
almost be alive. But it was only 
servomotors and complex reflec- 
tor circuits designed to lure the 
eyes away from danger, to confuse 
and teach. It was an instrument 
geared to react as she reacted, 
an anti-self which moved as she 

GALAXY 


moved, balancing light on its 
prisms, shifting its target, offering 
its counter-blade. 

Many blades appeared to lunge 
at her from the prisms, but only 
one was real. She countered the 
real one, slipped the sword past 
shield resistance to tap the target. 
A marker light came alive: red 
and glistening among the prisms 
. .more distraction. 

Again, the thing attacked, mov- 
ing at one-marker speed now, just 
a bit faster than it had at the 
beginning. 

She parried and, against all 
caution, moved into the danger 
zone, scored with the crysknife. 

Two lights glowed from the 
prisms. 

Again, the thing increased 
speed, moving out on its rollers, 
drawn like a magnet to the mo- 
tions of her body and the tip 
of her sword. 

Attack-parry-counter. 

Attack-parry-counter . , 

S HE HAD four lights alive in there 
now, and the thing was be- 
coming more dangerous, moving 
faster with each light, offering 
more areas of confusion. 

Five lights. 

Sweat glistened on her naked 
skin. She existed now in a 
universe whose dimensions were 
outlined by the threatening blade, 
the target, bare feet against the 
hard practice floor, hard senses/ 
nerves/ muscle — motion against 
motion. 

Attack-pariy-counter. 

Six lights . seven . 

Eight! 


In a recess of her mind there 
grew a sense of urgency, a crying 
out against such wildness as this. 
The instrument of prisms and 
target could not think, feel caution 
or remorse. And it carried a real 
blade. To go against less defeated 
the purpose of such training. 
That attacking blade could maim 
and it could kill. But the finest 
swordsmen in the Imperium never 
went against more than seven 
lights. 

Nine! 

Alia experienced a sense of su- 
preme exaltation. Attacking blade 
and target became blurs among 
blurs. She felt that the sword in 
her hand had come alive. She was 
an anti-target. She did not move 
the blade; it moved her. 

Ten! 

Eleven! 

Something flashed past her 
shoulder, slowed at the shield aura 
around the target, slid through 
and tripped the detonating stud. 
The lights darkened. Prisms and 
target twisted their way to 
stillness. 

Alia whirled, angered by the 
intrusion, but her reaction was 
thrown into tension by awareness 
of the supreme ability which had 
hurled that knife. It had been a 
throw just timed to exquisite 
nicety — just fast enough to get 
through the shield zone and not 
too fast to be deflected. 

And it had touched a one- 
millimeter spot within an eleven- 
light target. 

Alia found her own emotions 
and tensions running down in a 
manner not unlike that of the 


DUNE MESSIAH 


127 


target dummy. She was not at 
all surprised to see who had 
thrown the knife. 

Paul stood just inside the 
training room doorway, Stilgar 
three steps behind him. Her 
brother’s eyes were squinted in 
anger. 

Alia, growing conscious of her 
nudity, thought to cover herself, 
but found the idea amusing. What 
the eyes had seen could not be 
unseen. Slowly she replaced the 
sword in its sheath at her neck. 

“I presume you know how 
dangerous that was,” Paul said. 
He took his time reading the 
reactions on her face and body: 
the flush of her exertions coloring 
her skin, the wet fullness of her 
lips. There was a disquieting 
femaleness about her that he had 
never considered in his sister. He 
found it odd that he could look 
at a person who was this close 
to him and no longer recognize 
her in the identity framework 
which had seemed so fixed and 
familiar. 

“That was madness,” Stilgar 
rasped, coming up to stand beside 
Paul. 

The words were angry, but Alia 
heard awe in his voice and saw 
it in his eyes. 

UP leven lights,” Paul said, 

Li shaking his head. 

“I’d have made it twelve if you 
hadn’t interfered,” she said. She 
began to pale under his close 
regard and added: “And why do 
the damned things have that many 
lights if we’re not supposed to 
try for them?” 

12 ? 


“A Bene Gesserit should ask 
the reasoning behind an open- 
ended system?” Paul asked. 

“I suppose you never tried for 
more than seven!” she said, anger 
returning. His attentive posture 
began to annoy her. 

“Just once,” Paul said. “Gur- 
ney Halleck caught me on ten. 
My punishment was sufficiently 
embarrassing that I won't tell you 
what he did. And speaking of 
embarrassment . 

“Next time, perhaps you’ll have 
yourselves announced,” she said. 
She brushed past Paul into the 
bedroom, found a loose gray robe, 
slipped into it and began brushing 
her hair before a wall mirror. She 
felt sweaty, sad, a post coitum 
kind of sadness that left her with 
a desperate desire to bathe once 
more . and to sleep. “Why’re 
you here?” she asked. 

“My Lord,” Silgar said. There 
was an odd inflection in his voice 
that brought Alia around to stare 
at him. 

“We’re here at Irulan’s sugges- 
tion,” Paul said, “as strange as 
that may seem. She believes, and 
information in Stil’s possession 
appears to confirm it, that our 
enemies are about to make a ma- 
jor try for . 

“My Lord!” Stilgar said, his 
voice sharper. 

As her brother turned, ques- 
tioning. Alia continued to look 
at the old Fremen naib. Something 
about him now made her intensely 
aware that he was one of the 
primitives. Stilgar believed in a 
supernatural world very near him. 
It spoke to him in a simple pagan 

GALAXY 


tongue, dispelling all doubts. The 
natural universe in which he stood 
was fierce, unstoppable, and it 
lacked the common morality of 
the Imperium. 

“Yes, Stil,” Paul said. “Do you 
want to tell her why we came?” 

“This isn’t the time to talk of 
why we came,” Stilgar said. 

“What’s wrong, Stil?” 

Stilgar continued to stare at 
Alia. 

“Sire, are you blind?” 

Paul turned back to his sister, 
a feeling of unease beginning to 
fill him. Of all his aides, only 
Stilgar dared speak to him in that 
tone, but even Stilgar measured 
the occasion by its need. 

“This one must have a mate!” 
Stilgar blurted. “There’ll be trou- 
ble if she’s not wed, and that 
soon.” 

Alia whirled away, her face 
suddenly hot. How did he touch 
me? Bene Gesserit self-control 
had been powerless to prevent her 
reaction. How had Stilgar done 
that? He hadn’t the power of the 
Voice. She felt dismayed and 
angry. 

“Listen to the great Stilgar!” 
Alia said, keeping her back to 
them, aware of a shrewish quality 
in her voice and unable to hide 
it. “Advice to maidens from 
Stilgar, the Fremen!” 

“As I love you both, I must 
speak,” Stilgar said, a profound 
dignity in his tone. “I did not 
become a chieftain among the 
Fremen by being blind to what 
moves men and women to- 
gether. One needs no mysterious 
powers for this.” 

DUNE MESSIAH 


P aul weighed Stilgar’s meaning, 
reviewed what they had seen here 
and his own undeniable male 
reaction to his very own sister. 
Yes — there’d been a ruttish air 
about Alia, something wildly 
wanton. What had made her enter 
the practice floor in the nude? 
And risking her life in that 
foolhardy way! Eleven lights in 
the fencing prisms! That brainless 
automaton loomed in his mind 
with all the aspects of an ancient 
horror creature. Its possession was 
the shibboleth of this age, but 
it carried also the taint of old 
immorality. Once they had been 
guided by an artificial intelligence, 
computer brains. The Butlerian 
Jihad had ended that, but it hadn’t 
ended the aura of aristocratic vice 
which enclosed such things. 

Stilgar was right, of course. 
They must find a mate for Alia. 

“I will see to it,” Paul said. 
“Alia and I will discuss this 
later — privately.” 

Alia turned around, focused on 
Paul. Knowing how his mind 
worked, she realized she’d been 
the subject of a mentat decision, 
uncounted bits falling together in 
that human-computer analysis. 
There was an inexorable quality 
to this realization — a movement 
like the movement of planets. It 
carried something of the order of 
the universe in it, inevitable and 
terrifying. 

“Sirs,” Stilgar said, “perhaps 
we’d . .” 

“Not now!” Paul snapped. 
“We’ve other problems at the 
moment.” 

Aware that she dared not try 

129 


to match logic with her brother, 
Alia put the past few moments 
aside, Bene Gesserit fashion, and 
said: “Irulan sent you?” She 

found herself experiencing menace 
in that thought. 

“Indirectly,” Paul said. “The 
information she gives us confirms 
our suspicion that the Guild is 
about to try for a sandworm.” 

“They’ll try to capture a small 
one and attempt to start the spice 
cycle on some other world,” 
Stilgar said. “It means they’ve 
found a world they consider 
suitable.” 

“It means they have Fremen 
accomplices!” Alia argued. “No 
offworlder could capture a 
worm!” 

“That goes without saying,” 
Stilgar said. 

“No it doesn’t,” Alia said. She 
was outraged by such obtuseness. 
“Paul, certainly you . 

“The rot is setting in,” Paul 
said. “We’ve known that for quite 
some time. I’ve never seen this 
other world, though, and that 
bothers me. If they . .” 

“That bothers you?” Alia de- 
manded. “It means only that 
they’ve clouded its location with 
Steersmen the way they hide their 
sanctuaries.” 

Stilgar opened his mouth, clos- 
ed it without speaking. He had 
the overwhelming sensation that 
his idols had admitted blasphe- 
mous weakness. 

Paul, sensing Stilgar’s disquiet, 
said: “We’ve an immediate prob- 
lem! I want your opinion, Alia. 
Stilgar suggests we expand our 
patrols in the open bled and rein- 

130 


force the sietch watch. It’s just 
possible we could spot a landing 
party and prevent the . .” 

“With a Steersman guiding 
them?” Alia asked. 

“They are desperate, aren’t 
they?” Paul agreed. “That is why 
I’m here.” 

“What have they seen that we 
haven’t?” Alia asked. 

“Precisely.” 

A lia nodded, remembering her 
thoughts about the new Dune 
tarot. Quickly, she recounted her 
fears. 

“Throwing a blanket over us,” 
Paul said. 

“By having adequate patrols,” 
Stilgar ventured, “we might pre- 
vent the ...” 

“We prevent nothing . for- 
ever,” Alia said. She didn’t like 
the feel of the way Stilgar’s mind 
was working now. 

“We must count on their getting 
a worm,” Paul said. “Whether 
they can start the melange cycle 
on another planet is a different 
question. They’ll need more than 
a worm.” 

Stilgar looked from brother to 
sister. Out of ecological thinking 
that had been ground into him 
by sietch life, he grasped their 
meaning. A captive worm couldn’t 
live except within a small bit 
of Arrakis — sand plankton, Little 
Makers and all. The Guild’s prob- 
lem was large, but not impossi- 
ble. His own growing uncertainty 
lay in a different area. 

“Then your visions do not 
detect the Guild at its work?” 
he asked. 

GALAXY 


“Damnation!” Paul exploded. 

Alia studied Stilgar, sensing the 
savage sideshow of ideas taking 
place in his mind. He was hung 
on a rack of enchantment. Magic! 
Magic! To glimpse the future was 
to steal terrifying fire from a sa- 
cred flame. It held the attraction 
of ultimate peril, souls ventured 
and lost. One brought back from 
the formless, dangerous distances 
something with form and power. 
But Stilgar was beginning to sense 
other forces, perhaps greater 
powers beyond that unknown 
horizon. His Queen Witch and 
Sorcerer Friend had already 
betrayed dangerous weaknesses. 

“Stilgar,” Alia said, fighting to 
hold him, “you stand in a valley 
between dunes. I stand on the 
crest. I see where you do not 
see. And, among other things I see 
mountains which conceal the 
distances.” 

“There are things hidden from 
you,” Stilgar said. “This you’ve 
always said.” 

“All power is limited,” Alia 
said. 

“And danger may come from 
behind the mountains,” Stilgar 
said. 

“It’s something on that order,” 
Alia said. 

Stilgar nodded, his gaze fasten- 
ed on Paul’s face. “But whatever 
comes from behind the mountains 
must cross the dunes.” 

VIII 

The most dangerous game in 
the universe is to govern from 
an oracular base. We do not con- 

DUNE MESSIAH 


sider ourselves wise enough or 
brave enough to play that game. 
The measures detailed here for 
regulation in lesser matters are 
as near as we dare venture to 
the brink of government. For our 
purposes, we borrow a definition 
from the Bene Gesserit and we 
consider the various worlds as 
gene pools, sources of teachings 
and teachers, sources of the 
possible. Our goal is not to rule, 
but to tap these gene pools, to 
learn, and to free ourselves from 
all restraints imposed by depend- 
ency and government.

Guide 

ill s that where your father 
1 died?” Edric asked, sending 
a beam pointer from his tank to 
a jeweled marker on one of the 
relief maps adorning a wall of 
Paul’s reception salon. 

“That’s the shrine of his skull,” 
Paul said. “My father died a 
prisoner on a Harkonnen frigate 
in the sink below us.” 

“Oh, yes. I recall the story 
now,” Edric said. “Something 
about killing the old Baron 
Harkonnen, his mortal enemy.” 
Hoping he didn't betray too much 
of the abject terror which small 
enclosures such as this room im- 
posed upon him, Edric rolled over 
in the orange gas, directing his 
gaze at Paul, who sat alone on 
a long divan of striped gray and 
black. 

“My sister killed the Baron,” 
Paul said, voice and manner dry, 

131 


“just before the battle of Ar- 
rakeen.” 

And why, he wondered, did the 
Guild man-fish reopen old wounds 
in this place and at this time? 

The Steersman appeared to be 
fighting a losing battle to contain 
his nervous energies. Gone were 
the languid fish motions of their 
earlier encounter. Edric’s tiny eyes 
jerked here, there, questing and 
measuring. The one attendant who 
had accompanied him in here 
stood apart near the line of house- 
guards ranging the end wall at 
Paul’s left. The attendant worried 
Paul — with his hulking, thick- 
necked, blunt and vacant face. 
The man had entered the salon, 
nudging Edric’s tank along on its 
supporting field, walking with a 
strangler’s gait, arms akimbo. 

Scytale, Edric had called him. 
Scytale, an aide. 

The aide’s surface shouted 
stupidity, but the eyes betrayed 
him. They laughed at everything 
they saw. 

“Your concubine appeared to 
enjoy the performance of the face 
dancers,” Edric said. “It pleases 
me that I could provide that small 
entertainment. I particularly en- 
joyed her reaction to seeing her 
own features simultaneously re- 
peated by the whole troupe.” 

“Isn’t there a warning against 
Guildsmen bearing gifts?” Paul 
asked. 

And he thought of the perfor- 
mance out there in the Great Hall. 
The dancers had entered in the 
costumes and guise of the Dune 
tarot, flinging themselves about in 
seemingly random patterns that 

132 


devolved into fire eddies and an- 
cient prognostic designs. Then had 
come the rulers — a parade of 
kings and emperors like faces on 
coins, formal and stiff in outline, 
but curiously fluid. And the jokes: 
a copy of Paul’s own face and 
body, Chani repeated across the 
floor of the Hall, even Stilgar, 
who had grunted and shuddered 
while others laughed. 

“But our gifts have the kindest 
intent,” Edric protested. 

“How kindly can you be?” Paul 
asked. “The ghola you gave us 
believes he was designed to 
destroy us.” 

“Destroy you, Sire?” Edric 
asked, all bland attention. “Can 
one destroy a god?” 

S TILGAR, ENTERING On the last 
words, stopped and glared at the 
guards. They were much farther 
from Paul than he liked. Angrily, 
he motioned them closer. 

“It’s all right, Stil,” Paul said, 
lifting a hand. “Just a friendly 
discussion. Why don’t you move 
the Ambassador’s tank over by 
the end of my divan?” 

Stilgar, weighing the order, saw 
that it would put the Steersman’s 
tank between Paul and the hulking 
aide, much too close to Paul, 
but . 

“It’s all right, Stil,” Paul re- 
peated, and he gave the private 
hand signal which made the order 
an imperative. 

Moving with obvious reluc- 
tance, Stilgar pushed the tank 
closer to Paul. He didn’t like the 
feel of the container or the heavily 
perfumed smell of melange around 

GALAXY 


it. He took up a position at the 
corner of the tank beneath the 
orbiting device through which the 
Steersman spoke. 

“To kill a god,” Paul said. 
“That’s very interesting. But who 
says I’m a god?” 

“Those who worship you,” 
Edric said, glancing pointedly at 
Stilgar. 

“Is this what you believe?” 
Paul asked. 

“What I believe is of no mo- 
ment, Sire,” Edric said. “It seems 
to most observers, however, that 
you conspire to make a god of 
yourself. And one might ask if 
that is something any mortal can 
do . safely?” 

Paul studied the Guildsman. 
Repellent creature, but perceptive, 
It was a question Paul had asked 
himself time and again. But he 
had seen more than enough alter- 
nate timelines to have knowledge 
of worse possibilities than that of 
accepting godhead for himself. 
Much worse. These were not, 
however, the normal avenues for a 
Steersman to probe. Curious. Why 
had that question been asked? 
What could Edric hope to gain by 
such effrontery? Paul’s thoughts 
went flick (The association of 
Tleilaxu would be behind this 
move) flick (The Jihad’s recent 
Semoub victory would bear bn 
Edric’s action) flick (Certainly 
various Bene Gesserit credos have 
already showed themselves here) 
flick . 

A process involving thousands 
of information bits poured 
flickering through his computa- 
tional awareness. It required 

DUNE MESSIAH 


perhaps three seconds, no more. 

“Does a Steersman question the 
guidelines of prescience?” Paul 
asked, putting Edric on the 
weakest ground. 

This disturbed the Steersman, 
but he covered well, coming up 
with what sounded like a long 
aphorism: “No man of in- 

telligence questions the fact of 
prescience, Sire. Oracular vision 
has been known to men since 
most ancient times. It has a way 
of entangling us when we least 
suspect. Luckily, there are other 
forces in our universe.” 

“Greater ones than prescience?” 
Paul asked, pressing him. 

“If prescience alone existed and 
did everything, Sire, it would an- 
nihilate itself. To have nothing but 
prescience? Where could it be ap- 
plied except to its own degenera- 
ting movements?” 

“There’s always the human sit- 
uation,” Paul agreed. 

“A precarious thing at best,” 
Edric said, “without confusing it 
by hallucinations.” 

“Are my visions no more than 
hallucinations?” Paul asked, mock 
sadness in his voice. “Or do you 
imply that my worshipers hallu- 
cinate?” 

S tilgar, sensing the mounting 
tensions, moved a step nearer 
Paul and fixed his attention on 
the Guildsman reclining in the 
tank. 

“You twist my words. Sire,” 
Edric protested. An odd sense of 
violence lay suspended in the 
words. 

Violence here? Paul wondered. 

133 

• • 


They wouldn’t dare! Unless (and 
he glanced at his guards) the 
forces which protected him were 
to he used in replacing him. 

“But you accuse me of con- 
spiring to make a god of myself,” 
Paul said, pitching his voice that 
only Edric and Stilgar might hear. 
“Conspire?” 

“A poor choice of word, 
perhaps, my Lord,” Edric said. 

“But significant,” Paul said. “It 
says you expect the worst of me.” 

Edric arched his neck and 
stared sideways at Stilgar with a 
look of apprehension. “People al- 
ways expect the worst of the rich 
and powerful, Sire. It is said one 
can always tell an aristocrat: he 
reveals only those of his vices 
which will make him popular.” 

A tremor passed across Stilgar’s 
face. 

Paul looked up at the move- 
ment, sensing the thoughts and 
angers whispering in Stilgar’s 
mind. How dared this Guildsman 
talk thus to Muad’dib? 

“You’re not joking, of course.” 

“Joking, Sire?” 

Paul grew aware of dryness in 
his mouth. He felt that there were 
too many people in this room, 
that the air he breathed had pass- 
ed through too many lungs. The 
taint of melange, from Edric’s tank 
felt threatening. 

“Who might my accomplices be 
in such a conspiracy?” Paul ask- 
ed presently. “Do you nominate 
the Qizarate?” 

Edric’s shrug stirred the orange 
gas around his head. He no longer 
appeared concerned by Stilgar, 
who continued to glare at him. 

134 


“Are you suggesting that my 
missionaries of the Holy Orders, 
all of them, are preaching subtle 
falsehood?” Paul insisted. 

“It could be a question of self- 
interest and sincerity,” Edric said. 

Stilgar put a hand to the 
crysknife beneath his robe. 

Paul shook his head and said: 
“Then you accuse me of insin- 
cerity.” 

“I’m not sure that accuse is 
the proper word, Sire.” 

The boldness of this creature! 
Paul thought. And he said: “Ac- 
cuse or not, you’re saying my 
bishops and I are no better than 
power hungry brigands.” 

“Power hungry, Sire?” Again, 
Edric looked at Stilgar. “Power 
tends to isolate those who hold 
too much of it. Eventually, they 
lose touch with reality . and 
fall.” 

“M’Lord,” Stilgar growled at 
him “you’ve had men executed for 
less!” 

“Men, yes,” Paul agreed. “But 
this is a Guild Ambassador.” 

“He accused you of an unholy 
fraud!” Stilgar said. 

“His thinking interests me, 
Stil,” Paul said. “Contain your 
anger and remain alert.” 

“As Muad’dib commands.” 
“Tell me, Steersman,” Paul 
said, “how could we maintain this 
hypothetical fraud over such 
enormous distances of space and 
time without the means to watch 
every missionary, to examine 
every nuance in every Qizarate 
priory and temple?” 

“What is time to you?” Edric 
asked. 


GALAXY 


S TILGAR FROWNED in obvious 
puzzlement. And then he 
thought: Muad’dib has often said 
he sees past the veils of time. What 
is the Guildsman really saying? 

“Wouldn’t the structure of such 
a fraud begin to show holes?” 
Paul asked. “Significant disagree- 
ments, schisms, doubts and con- 
fessions of guilt — surely fraud 
could not suppress all these.” 
“What religion and self-interest 
cannot hide, governments can,” 
Edric said. 

“Are you testing the limits of 
my tolerance?” Paul asked. 

“Do my arguments lack all 
merit?” Edric countered. 

Does he want us to kill him? 
Paul wondered. Is Edric offering 
himself as a sacrifice? 

“I prefer the cynical view,” 
Paul said, testing. “You obviously 
are trained in all the lying tricks 
of statecraft, the double meanings 
and the power words. Language 
is nothing more than a weapon 
to you and, thus, you try my 
armor.” 

“The cynical view,” Edric said, 
a smile stretching his mouth. 
“And rulers are always no- 
toriously cynical where religions 
are concerned. Religion, too, is a 
weapon. What manner of weapon 
then is religion when it becomes 
the government?” 

Paul felt himself go inwardly 
still, a profound caution gripping 
him. To whom was Edric speak- 
ing? Damnably clever words, 
that were heavy with manipulation 
leverages — that subtle undertone 
of comfortable humor, the 

DUNE MESSIAH 


unspoken air of shared secrets; his 
manner said he and Paul were two 
sophisticates, men of a wider 
universe who understood things 
not granted common folk. With a 
feeling of shock, Paul realized that 
he had not been the main target 
for all this rhetoric. This affliction 
visited upon the court had been 
speaking for the benefit of 
others — speaking to Stilgar, to the 
household guards . perhaps 
even to the hulking aide. 

“Religious mana was thrust 
upon me,” Paul said. “I did not 
seek it.” And he thought: There! 
Let this man-fish think himself 
victorious in our battle of words! 

“Then why have you not 
disavowed it, Sire?” Edric asked. 

“Because of my sister, Alia,” 
Paul said, watching Edric careful- 
ly. “She is a goddess. Let me 
urge caution where Alia is con- 
cerned lest she strike you dead 
with her glance.” 

A gloating smile began forming 
on Edric’s mouth, then was 
replaced by a look of shock. 

“I am deadly serious,” Paul 
said, watching the shock spread, 
seeing Stilgar nod. 

In a bleak voice, Edric said: 
“You have mauled my confidence 
in you, Sire. And no doubt that 
was your intent.” 

“Do not be certain you know 
my intent,” Paul said, and he 
signaled Stilgar that the audience 
was at an end. 

To Stilgar’s questioning gesture 
asking if Edric were to be 
assassinated, Paul gave a negative 
hand sign and amplified it with 
an imperative lest Stilgar take 

135 


matters into his own hands now. 

Scytale, Edric’s aide, moved to 
the rear corner of the tank and 
nudged it toward the door. When 
he came near Paul, he stopped 
and turned that laughing gaze 
on Paul, and said: “If my Lord 
permits?” 

“Yes, what is it?” Paul asked, 
noting how Stilgar moved close 
in answer to the implied menace 
from this man. 

“Some say,” Scytale said, “that 
people cling to Imperial leadership 
because space is infinite. They feel 
lonely without a unifying symbol. 
For a lonely people, the Emperor 
is a definite place. They can turn 
toward him and say: ‘See, there 
He is. He makes us one.’ Perhaps 
religion serves the same purpose, 
m’Lord.” 

S cytale nodded pleasantly and 
gave Edirc’s tank another nudge. 
They moved out of the salon, 
Edric supine in his tank, eyes 
closed. The Steersman appeared 
spent, all his nervous energies ex- 
hausted. 

Paul stared after the shambling 
figure of Scytale, wondering at 
the man’s words. A peculiar 
fellow, that Scytale, he thought. 
While he was speaking, he had 
radiated a feeling of many 
people — as though his entire 
genetic inheritance lay exposed on 
his skin. 

“That was odd,” Stilgar said, 
speaking to no one in particular. 

Paul arose from the divan as 
a guard closed the door behind 
Edric and the escort. 

“Odd,” Stilgar repeated. A vein 

136 


began throbbing at his temple. 

Paul dimmed the salon’s lights 
and moved to a window which 
opened onto an angled cliff of 
his Keep. Lights glittered far 
below — pigmy movement. A work 
gang moved down there bringing 
giant plasmeld blocks to repair 
a facade of Alia’s temple which 
had been damaged by a freak 
twisting of a sandblast wind. 

“That was a foolish thing, Usui, 
inviting that creature into these 
chambers,” Stilgar said. 

Usui, Paul thought. My sietch 
name. Stilgar reminds me that he 
ruled over me once, that he saved 
me jrom the desert. 

“Why did you do it?” Stilgar 
asked, speaking from close behind 
Paul. 

“Data,” Paul said. “I need 
more data.” 

“Is it not dangerous to try 
meeting this threat only as a men- 
tat?” 

That was perceptive, Paul 
thought. 

Mentat computation remained 
finite. You couldn’t say something 
boundless within the boundaries 
of any language. Mentat abilities 
had their uses, though. He said 
as much now, daring Stilgar to 
refute his argument. 

“There is always something on. 
the outside,” Stilgar said. “Some 
things best kept outside.” 

“Or inside,” Paul said. And he 
accepted for a moment his own 
oracular/ mentat final summation. 
Outside, yes. And inside — here 
lay the true horror. How could 
he protect himself from himself? 
They certainly were setting him 

GALAXY 


up to destroy himself, but this 
was a position hemmed in by even 
more terrifying possibilities. 

His reverie was broken by the 
sound of rapid footsteps. The 
figure of Korba the Qizara surged 
through the doorway backlighted 
by the brilliant illumination in the 
hallways. He entered as though 
hurled by an unseen force and 
came to an almost immediate halt 
when he encountered the salon’s 
gloom. His hands appeared to be 
full of shigawire reels. They glit- 
tered in the light from the hall, 
strange little round jewels that 
were suddenly extinguished as a 
guardsman’s hand came into view, 
closed the door. 

“Is that you, m’Lord?” Korba 
asked, peering into the shadows. 
“What is it?” Stilgar asked. 
“Stilgar?” 

“We’re both here. What is it?” 
“I’m disturbed by this reception 
for the Guildsman.” 

“Disturbed?” Paul asked. 

“The people say, m’Lord, that 
you honor our enemies.” 

“Is that all?” Paul said. “Are 
those the reels I asked you to 
bring earlier?” He indicated the 
shigawire orbs in Korba’s hands. 

“Reels ... oh! Yes, m’Lord. 
These are the histories. Will you 
view them here?” 

“I’ve viewed them. I want them 
for Stilgar here.” 

or me?” Stilgar asked. He 
r felt resentment grow at what 
he interpreted as caprice on Paul’s 
part. Histories! Stilgar had sought 
out Paul earlier to discuss the 
logistics computations for the 

DUNE MESSIAH 


Zabulon conquest. Then the Guild 
Ambassador’s presence had inter- 
vened. And now — Korba with 
histories! 

“How much history do you 
know?” Paul mused aloud, study- 
ing the shadowy figure beside him. 

“M'Lord, I can name every 
world our people touched in their 
migrations. I know the reaches 
of Imperial . .” 

“The Golden Age of Earth, 
have you ever studied that?” 
“Earth? Golden Age?” Stilgar 
was irritated and puzzled. Why 
would Paul wish to discuss myths 
from the dawn of time? Stilgar’s 
mind still felt crammed with 
Zabulon data — computations from 
the staff mentats: two hun- 

dred and five attack frigates with 
thirty Legions, support battalions, 
pacification cadres, and Qizarate 
missionaries . the food require- 
ments (he had the figures right 
here in his mind) and melange 
. weaponry, uniforms, medals 
. urns for the ashes of the 
dead . the number of spe- 
cialists — men to produce raw 
materials of propaganda, clerks, 
accountants . spies . and 
spies upon the spies . 

“I brought with me the pulse- 
synchronizer attachment, also, 
m’Lord,” Korba ventured. He ob- 
viously sensed the tensions build- 
ing between Paul and Stilgar and 
was disturbed by them. 

Stilgar shook his head from side 
to side. Pulse-synchronizer? Why 
would Paul wish him to use a 
mnemnonic flutter system on a 
shigawire projector? Why scan for 
specific data in histories? This was 

137 


mental work. As usual, Stilgar 
found he couldn’t escape a deep 
suspicion at the thought of using 
a projector and attachments. The 
thing always immersed him in 
varied and disturbing sensations, 
an overwhelming shower of data 
which his mind sorted out later, 
surprising him with information 
he had not known he possessed. 

“Sire, I came with the Zabulon 
computations,” Stilgar said. 

“Dehydrate the Zabulon com- 
putations!” Paul snapped, using 
the obscene Fremen term which 
meant that here was moisture no 
man could demean himself by 
touching. 

“M’Lord!” 

“Stilgar,” Paul said, “you 
urgently need a sense of balance 
which can come only from an 
understanding of long-term ef- 
fects. What little information we 
have about the old times, the pit- 
tance of data which the Butlerians 
left us, Korba has brought it for 
you. Start with Genghis Khan.” 
“Genghis . Khan? Was he of 
the Sardaukar, m’Lord?” 

“Oh, long before that. He 
killed . perhaps four million.” 
“He must have had formidable 
weaponry to kill that many, Sire. 
Lasbeams, perhaps, or . .” 

“He didn’t kill them himself, 
Stil. He killed the way I kill, by 
sending out his legions. There s 
another emperor I want you to 
note in passing — a Hitler. He 
killed maybe fifteen million. Pret- 
ty good for those days. 

“Killed. .by his legions?” 
“Yes.” 

“Not very impressive statistics.” 

133 


ery good, Stil.” Paul glanced 
Y at the reels in Korba’s hands. 
Korba stood with them as though 
he wished he could drop them 
and flee. “Statistics: at a conser- 
vative estimate, I’ve killed sixty- 
one billion, sterilized ninety 
planets, completely demoralized 
five hundred others. I’ve wiped 
out the followers of forty religions 
which had existed since ...” 
“Unbelievers!” Korba loudly 
protested. “Unbelievers all!” 

“No,” Paul said. “Believers.’ 

“My Liege makes a joke,” 
Korba said, voice trembling. “The 
Jihad has brought ten thousand 
worlds into the shining light 

of ...” , . , 

“Into the darkness,” Paul said. 
“We’ll be a hundred generations 
recovering from Muad’dib’s Jihad. 

I find it hard to imagine that 
anyone will ever surpass this. A 
barking laugh erupted from his 

“What now amuses Muad'dib?" 
Stilgar asked. 

“I am not amused. I merely 
had a sudden vision of the Em- 
peror Hitler saying something 
similar. No doubt he did. 

“No other ruler ever had your 
powers,” Korba argued. “Who 
would dare challenge you? Your 
legions now control all ^the 
known universe and all the ...” 
“The legions control,” Paul 
said. “I wonder if they know 

this?” , . 

“You control your legions, 
Sire,” Stilgar interrupted, and it 
was obvious from the tone of his 
voice that he suddenly felt his 
own position in that chain of 

GALAXY 


command, his own hand guiding 
all that power. 

Having set Stilgar’s thoughts in 
motion along the track he wanted, 
Paul turned his full attention to 
Korba. “Put the reels here on 
the divan.” As Korba obeyed, 
Paul said: “How goes the recep- 
tion, Korba? Does my sister have 
everything well in hand?” 

“Yes, m’Lord.” Korba’s tone 
was wary. “And Chani watches 
from the spy hole. She suspects 
there may be Sardaukar in the 
Guild entourage.” 

“No doubt she’s correct,” Paul 
said. “The jackals gather.” 

“Bannerjee,” Stilgar said, nam- 
ing the chief of Paul’s security 
detail, “was worried earlier that 
some of them might try to pene- 
trate the private areas of the 
Keep.” 

“Have they?” 

“Not yet.” 

“But there was some confusion 
in the formal gardens,” Korba 
said. 

“What sort of confusion?” 
Stilgar demanded. 

Paul nodded. 

“Strangers coming and going,” 
Korba said, “trampling the plants, 
whispering to each other. I heard 
reports of some rather disturbing 
remarks.” 

“Such as?” Paul asked. 

“Is this the way our taxes are 
■ spent? I’m told the Ambassador 
himself asked that question.” 

“I don’t find that surprising,” 
Paul said. “Were there many 
strangers in the gardens?” 
“Dozens, m’Lord.” 

“Bannerjee stationed picked 

DUNE MESSIAH 



troopers at the vulnerable doors, 
m’Lord,” Stilgar said. He turned 
as he spoke, allowing the salon’s 
single remaining light to illuminate 
half his face. The peculiar light- 
ing, the face, all touched a node 
of memory buried deep in Paul’s 
mind — something from the desert. 
Paul didn’t bother bringing it to 
full recall, his attention being 
focused on how Stilgar had pulled 
back mentally. The Fremen had 
a tight-skinned forehead which 
mirrored almost every thought 
flickering across his mind. He was 
suspicious now, rather profoundly 
suspicious of his Emperor’s odd 
behavior. 

“I don’t like the intrusion into 
the gardens,” Paul said. “Courtesy 
to guests is one thing, and the 
formal necessities of greeting an 
envoy, but this . .” 

“I’ll see to removing them,” 
Korba said. “Immediately.” 
“Wait!” Paul ordered as Korba 
started to turn. 

I n THE ABRUPT stillness of the 
moment, Stilgar edged himself in- 
to a position where he could study 
Paul’s face. It was deftly done. 
Paul admired the way of it, an 
achievement devoid of any for- 
wardness. It was a Fremen thing: 
slyness touched by respect for 
another’s privacy; a movement of 
necessity. 

“What time is it?” Paul asked. 
“Almost midnight, Sire,” Korba 
said. 

“Korba, I think you may be 
my finest creation,” Paul said. 

“Sire!” There was injury in 
Korba’s voice. 

139 


“Do you feel awe of me?” Paul 
asked. 

“You are Paul-Muad’dib who 
was Usui in our sietch,” Korba 
said. “You know my devotion 
to . 

“Have you ever felt like an 
apostle?” Paul asked. 

Korba obviously misunderstood 
the words, but correctly inter- 
preted the tone. “My Emperor 
knows I have a clean conscience!” 

“Shai-hulud save us,” Paul 
murmured. 

The questioning silence of the 
moment was broken by the sound 
of someone whistling as he walked 
down the outer hall. The whistling 
was stilled by a guardsman’s 
barked command as it came op- 
posite the door. 

“Korba, I think you may sur- 
vive all this,” Paul said. And he 
read the growing light of un- 
derstanding on Stilgar’s face. 

“The strangers in the gardens, 
Sire?” Stilgar asked. 

“Ahh, yes,” Paul said. “Have 
Bannerjee put them out, Stil. 
Korba will assist.” 

“Me, Sire?” Korba betrayed 
deep disquiet. 

“Some of my friends have 
forgotten they once were Fre- 
men,” Paul said, speaking to Kor- 
ba, but designing his words for 
Stilgar. “You will mark down the 
ones Chani identifies as Sardaukar 
and you will have them killed. 
Do it yourself. I want it done 
quietly and without undue distur- 
bance. We must keep in mind 
that there’s more to religion and 
government than approving trea- 
ties and sermons.” 

140 


“I shall obey the orders of 
Muad’dib,” Korba whispered. 

“The Zabulon computations?” 
Stilgar asked. 

“Tomorrow,” Paul said. “And 
when the strangers are removed 
from the gardens, announce that 
the reception is ended. The party’s 
over, Stil.” 

“I understand, m’Lord.” 

“I’m sure you do,” Paul said. 

IX 

Here lies a toppled god — 

His fall was not a small one. 

We did but build his pedestal, 

A narrow and a tall one. 

— Tleilaxu Epigram 

A lia crouched, resting elbows on 
knees, chin on fists, and stared 
at the body on the dune — a few 
bones and some tattered flesh that 
once had been a young woman. 
The hands, the head, most of the 
upper torso were gone — eaten by 
the coriolis wind. The sand all 
around bore the tracks of her 
brother’s medics and questors. 
They were gone now, all except- 
ing the mortuary attendants who 
stood to one side with Hayt, the 
ghola, waiting for her to finish her 
mysterious perusal of what had 
been written here. 

A wheat-colored sky enfolded 
the scene in the glaucous light 
common to midafternoon for 
these latitudes. 

The body had been discovered 
several hours earlier by a low- 
flying courier whose instruments 
had detected a faint water trace 


GALAXY 


where none should be. His call 
had brought the experts. And they 
had learned — what? That this had 
been a woman of about twenty 
years, a Fremen who was ad- 
dicted to semuta . and she had 
died here in the crucible of the 
desert from the effects of a subtle 
poison of Tleilaxu origin. 

To die in the desert was a com- 
mon enough occurrence. But a 
Fremen addicted to semuta, this 
was such a rarity that Paul had 
sent her to examine the scene in 
the ways their mother had taught 
them. 

Alia felt that she had ac- 
complished nothing here except to 
cast her own aura of mystery 
about a scene that was already 
mysterious enough. She heard the 
ghola’s feet stir the sand; she 
looked at him. His attention 
rested momentarily upon the 
escort ’thopters circling overhead 
like a flock of ravens. 

Beware of the Guild bearing 
gifts. Alia thought. 

The mortuary ’thopter and her 
own craft stood on the sand near 
a rock outcropping behind the 
ghola. Focusing on the grounded 
’thopters filled Alia with a craving 
to be airborne and away from 
here. 

But Paul had thought she might 
see something here which others 
would miss. She squirmed in her 
stillsuit. It felt raspingly un- 
familiar after all the suitless 
months of city life. She studied 
the ghola, wondering if he might 
know something important about 
this peculiar death. A lock of his 
black-goat hair, she saw, had 

DUNE MESSIAH 


escaped his stillsuit hood. She 
sensed her hand longing to tuck 
that hair back into place. 

As though lured by this 
thought, his gleaming gray metal 
eyes turned toward her. The eyes 
set her trembling and she tore 
her gaze away from him. 

A Fremen woman had died 
here from a poison called “the 
throat of hell.” 

A Fremen addicted to semuta. 

She shared Paul's disquiet at 
this conjunction. 

The mortuary attendants waited 
patiently. This corpse contained 
not enough water for them to 
salvage. They felt no need to 
hurry. And they’d believe that 
Alia, through some glyptic art, 
was reading a strange truth in 
these remains. 

No strange truth came to her. 

There was only a distant feeling 
of anger deep within her at the 
obvious thoughts in the at- 
tendants’ minds. It was a product 
of the damned religious mystery. 
She and her brother could not 
be people. They had to be 
something more. And the Bene 
Gesserit had seen to that by 
manipulating Atreides ancestry. 
Their mother had contributed to 
it by thrusting them onto the path 
of witchery. 

A nd Paul perpetuated the dif- 
ference. 

The Reverend Mothers en- 
capsulated in Alia’s memories 
stirred restlessly, provoking adab 
flashes of thought: Peace, Little 
One! You are what you are. There 
are compensations. 

141 


She summoned the ghola with 
a gesture. 

He stopped beside her, at- 
tentive, patient. 

“What do you see in this?” 
she asked. 

“We may never learn who it 
was died here,” he said. “The 
head, the teeth are gone. The 
hands . Unlikely such a one had 
a genetic record somewhere to 
which her cells could be easily 
matched.” 

“Tleilaxu poison,” she said. 
“What do you make of that?” 
“Many people can purchase 
such poisons.” 

“True enough. And this flesh 
is too far gone to be regrown 
as was done with your body.” 
“Even if you could trust the 
Tleilaxu to do it,” he said. 

She nodded and stood. “You 
will fly me back to the city now.” 
When they were airborne and 
pointed north, she said: “You fly 
exactly as Duncan Idaho did.” 

He cast a speculative glance 
at her. “Others have told me this.” 
“What are you thinking now?” 
“Many things.” 

“Stop dodging my question, 
damn you!” 

“Which question?” 

She glared at him. 

He saw the glare, shrugged. 
How like Duncan Idaho, that 
gesture, she thought. Accusingly, 
her voice thick and with a catch 
in it, she said: “I merely wanted 
your reactions voiced to play my 
own thoughts against them. That 

young woman’s death bothers 
*» 


“I was not thinking about that.” 
“What were you thinking 
about?” 

“About the strange emotions I 
feel when people speak of the 
one I may have been.” 

“May have been?” 

“The Tleilaxu are very clever.” 
“Not that clever. You were 
Duncan Idaho.” 

“Very likely. It’s the prime 
computation.” 

“So you get emotional?” 

“To a degree. I feel eagerness. 
I’m uneasy. There’s a tendency 
to tremble and I must devote ef- 
fort to controlling it. I suddenly 
get. .flashes of imagery.” 

“What imagery?” 

“It’s too rapid to recognize. 
They’re flashes. Spasms. .almost 
memories.” 

“Aren’t you curious about such 
memories?” 

“Of course. Curiosity urges 
me forward, but I move against 
a heavy reluctance. I think: ‘What 
if I’m not the one they believe 
me to be?’ I don’t like that 
thought.” 

“And this is all you were 
thinking?” 

“You know better than that. 
Alia.” 

How dare he use my given 
name? She felt anger rise and go 
down beneath the memory of the 
way he’d spoken: softly throbbing 
undertones, casual male confi- 
dence. A muscle twitched along 
her jaw. She clenched her teeth. 

«¥ sn’t that El Kuds down 
I there?” he asked, dipping a 
wing briefly. 


142 


GALAXY 


She looked down at their shad- 
ows rippling across the promon- 
tory above Harg Pass, at the cliff 
and the rock pyramid containing 
the skull of her father. El 
Kuds — the Holy Place. 

“That’s the Holy Place,” she 
said. 

“I must visit that place one 
day,” he said. “Nearness to your 
father’s remains may bring back 
memories I can capture.” 

She saw suddenly how strong 
must be this need to know who 
he’d been. It was a central com- 
pulsion with him. She looked back 
at the rocks, the cliff with its 
base sloping into a dry beach and 
a sea of sand — cinnamon rock 
lifting from the dunes like a ship 
breasting waves. 

“Circle back,” she said. 

“Thf* escort 

“They’ll follow. Swing under 
them.” 

He obeyed. 

“Do you truly serve my 
brother?” she asked, when he was 
on the new course, the escort 
following. 

“I serve the Atreides,” he said, 
his tone formal. 

And she saw his right hand 
lift and fall — almost the old salute 
of Caladan. A pensive look came 
over his face. She watched him 
peer down at the rock pyramid. 
“What bothers you?” she asked. 
His lips moved. A voice emerg- 
ed, brittle, tight: “He was . he 
was . ” A tear slid down his 
clicclc 

Alia found herself stilled by 
Fremen awe. He gave water to 
the dead! Compulsively, she 

DUNE MESSIAH 


touched a finger to his cheek, 
felt the tear. 

“Duncan,” she whispered. 

He appeared locked to the 
’thopter’s controls and his gaze 
fastened to the tomb below. 

She raised her voice: “Dun- 
can!” 

He swallowed, shook his head 
and looked at her, the metal eyes 
were now glistening. “I felt an 
arm ... on my shoulders,” he 
whispered. “I felt it! An arm.” 
His throat worked. “It was ... a 
friend. It was ... my friend.” 

“Who?” 

“I don’t know. I think it 
was ... I don’t know.” 

The call light began flashing 
in front of Alia, their escort cap- 
tain wanting to know why they 
returned to the desert. She took 
the microphone, explaining that 
they had paid a brief homage to 
her father’s tomb. The captain re- 
minded her that it was late. 

“We will go to Arrakeen now,” 
she said, carefully replacing the 
microphone. 

Hayt took a deep breath and 
banked their ’thopter around to 
the north. 

“It was my father’s arm you 
felt, wasn’t it?” she asked. 

“Perhaps.” 

His voice was that of the men- 
tat computing probabilities, and 
she saw he had regained his com- 
posure. 

“Are you aware of how I know 
my father?” she asked. 

“I have some idea.” 

“Let me make it clear,” she 
said. Briefly, she explained how 
she had awakened to Reverend 

143 


Mother awareness before birth, a 
terrified fetus with the knowledge 
of countless lives imbedded in her 
nerve cells — and all this after the 
death of her father. 

“I know my father as my 
mother knew him,” she said. “In 
every last detail of every ex- 
perience she shared with him. In 
a way, I am my mother. I have 
all her memories up to the mo- 
ment when she drank the Water 
of Life and entered the trance 
of transmigration.” 

“Your brother had once ex- 
plained something of this.” 

“He did? Why?” 

“I asked.” 

“Why?” 

“A mentat requires data.” 
“Oh.” She looked down below 
at the flat expanse of the Shield 
Wall — tortured rock, pits and 
crevices. 

H e saw the direction of her gaze 
and said: “A very exposed 

place, that down there.” 

“But an easy place to hide.” 
she said. She looked at him. “It 
reminds me a little bit of a human 
mind . with all its conceal- 
ments.” 

“Ahhhh,” he said. 

“Ahhli? What does that ut- 
terance mean — ahhh?” She was 
suddenly angry with him and the 
reason for it escaped her. 

“You'd like to know what my 
mind conceals,” he said. It was 
a statement, not a question. 

“How do you know I haven’t 
exposed you for what you are 
by my powers of prescience?” she 
demanded. 

144 


“Have you?” He seemed gen- 
uinely curious. 

“No!” 

“Sybils have limits,” he said. 

He appeared to be amused and 
this somewhat reduced Alia’s anger. 
Amused? “Have you no respect 
for my powers?” she asked. The 
question sounded weakly argu- 
mentative even to her own ears. 

“I respect your omens and por- 
tents perhaps more than you 
think,” he said. “I was in the 
audience for your Morning Rit- 
ual.” 

“And what does that signify?” 

“You’ve great ability with sym- 
bols,” he said, keeping his atten- 
tion on the ’thopter’s controls. 
“That’s a Bene Gesserit thing, I’d 
say. But, as with many witches, 
you’ve become careless of your 
powers.” 

She felt a spasm of fear and 
blared: “How dare you?” 

“I dare much more than my 
makers anticipated,” he said. 
“Because of that rare fact, I re- 
main with your, brother.” 

Alia studied the steel balls 
which were his eyes — no human 
expression there. The stillsuit 
hood concealed the line of his 
jaw. His mouth remained firm, 
though. There was great strength 
in it. .and determination. His 
words had carried a reassuring 
intensity. “ . dare much 
more . .” That was a thing Dun- 
can Idaho might have said. Had 
the Tleilaxu fashioned their ghola 
better than they knew — or was 
this more sham, part of his condi- 
tioning? 

“Explain yourself, ghola.” 

GALAXY 


“Know thyself, is that thy com- 
mandment?” he asked. 

Again, she felt that he was 
amused. “Don’t bandy words with 
me, you . you thing]" she said. 
She put a hand to the crysknife 
in its throat sheath. “Why were 
you given to my brother?” 

“Your brother tells me that you 
watched the presentation,” he 
said. “You’ve heard me answer 
that question for him.” ^ 

“Answer it again . for me!” 

“I am intended to destroy him.” 
“Is that the mentat speaking?” 
“You knew the answer to that 
without asking,” he chided. “And 
you know, as well, that such a 
gift wasn’t at all necessary. Your 
brother already was destroying 
himself quite adequately.” 

She weighed these words, her 
hand remaining on the shaft of 
her knife. A tricky answer, but 
there was sincerity in the voice. 

“Then why such a gift?” she 
probed. 

“It may have amused the 
Tleilaxu. And it is true that, the 
Guild asked for me as a gift.” 
“Why?” 

“Same answer.” 

“How am I careless of my 

powers?” . 

“How are you employing 
them?” he countered. 

H is question slashed through to 
her own misgivings. She took her 
hand away from the knife and 
asked: “Why do you say my 
brother was destroying himself?” 
“Oh, come now, child! Where 
are these vaunted powers? Have 
you no ability to reason?” 

DUNE MESSIAH 


Controlling anger, she said: 
“Reason for me, mentat.” 

“Very well.” He sadly glanced 
around at their escort, then 
returned his attention to their 
course. The plain of Arrakeen was 
beginning to show beyond the 
northern rim of the Shield Wall. 
The pattern of the pan and graben 
villages remained indistinct be- 
neath a dust pall, but the distant 
gleam of Arrakeen could be 

discerned. , 

“Symptoms,” he said. Your 
brother keeps with him an official 
panegyrist who ...” 

“Who was a gift of the Fremen 

Naibs!” 

“An odd gift from friends, he 
said. “Why would they surround 
him with flattery and servility? 
Have you really listened to this 
panegyrist? ‘The people are illu- 
minated by Maud’dib. The Umma 
Regent, our Emperor, came out 
of darkness to shine resplendently 
upon all men. He is our Sire. 
He is precious water from an 
endless fountain. He spills joy for 
all the universe to drink.’ Pah! 

Speaking softly, Alia said: “If 
I but repeated your words for 
our Fremen escort,, they’d hack 
you into bird feed.” 

“Then tell them.” 

“My brother rules, by the 
natural law of heaven!” 

“You don’t believe that, so why 
say it?” 

“How do you know what I 
believe?” She suddenly ex- 
perienced trembling that no Bene 
Gesserit powers could control. 
This ghola was having an effect 
she hadn’t anticipated.

“You commanded me to reason 
as a mentat,” he reminded her. 

“No mentat knows what I 
believe!” She took two deep, 
shuddering breaths. “How dare 
you judge us?” 

“Judge you? I don’t judge.” 

“You’ve no idea how we were 
taught!” 

“Both of you were taught to 
govern,” he said. “You were con- 
ditioned to an overweening thirst 
for power. You were imbued with 
a shrewd grasp of politics and 
a deep understanding for the uses 
of war and ritual. Natural law? 
What natural law? That myth 
haunts human history. Haunts! 
It’s a ghost. It’s insubstantial, 
unreal. Is your Jihad a natural 
law?” 

“Mentat jabber,” she sneered. 

“I’m a servant of the Atreides 
and I speak with candor,” he said. 

“Servant? We’ve no servants; 
only disciples.” 

“And I am a disciple of 
awareness,” he said. “Understand 
that, child, and you . .” 

“Don’t call me child!” she 
snapped. She slipped her crysknife 
half out of its sheath. 

“I stand corrected.” He glanced 
at her, smiled and returned his 
attention to piloting the ’thopter. 
The cliff-sided structure of the 
Atreides Keep could be made out 
now, dominating the northern 
suburbs of Arrakeen. “You are 
something ancient in flesh that 
is little more than a child,” he 
said. “And the flesh is disturbed 
by winds of womanhood.” 

“I don’t know why I listen to 
you,” she growled, but she let 

146 


the crysknife fall back into its 
sheath and wiped her palm on 
her robe. The palm, wet with 
perspiration, disturbed her sense 
of Fremen frugality. Such a waste 
of the body’s moisture! 

“You listen because you know 
I’m devoted to your brother,” he 
said. “My actions are clear and 
easily understood.” 

“Nothing about you is clear and 
easily understood. You’re the 
most complex creature I’ve ever 
seen. How do I know what the 
Tleilaxu built into you?” 

“By mistake or intent,” he said, 
“they gave me freedom to mold 
myself.” 

U\T ou retreat into Zensunni 
I parables,” she accused. “The 
wise man molds himself — The fool 
lives only to die.” Her voice was 
heavy with mimicry. “Disciple of 
awareness!” 

“Men cannot separate means 
and enlightenment,” he said. 
“You speak riddles!” 

“I speak riddles!” 

“I speak to the opening mind.” 
“I’m going to repeat all this 
to Paul.” 

“He’s heard most of it already.” 
She found herself overwhelmed 
by curiosity. “How is it you’re 
still alive . and free? What did 
he say?” 

“He laughed. And he said, 
‘People don’t want a bookkeeper 
for an Emperor; they want a 
master, someone who’ll protect 
them from change.’ But he agreed 
that destruction of his Empire 
arises from himself.” 

“Why would he speak so?” 

GALAXY 


“Because I convinced him I 
understand his problem and will 
help him.” 

“What could you possibly have 
said to do that?” 

He remained silent, banking the 
’thopter into the downwind leg 
for a landing at the guard complex 
on the roof of the Keep. 

“I demand you tell me what 
you said!” 

“I’m not sure you could take 
it.” 

“I’ll be the judge of that'.^I 
command you to speak at once!” 
“Permit me to land us first,” 
he said. And not waiting for her 
permission, he turned onto the 
base leg, brought the wings into 
optimum lift and settled gently 
onto the bright orange pad atop 
the roof. 

“Now,” Alia said. “Speak.” 

“I told him that to endure 
oneself may be the hardest task 
in the universe.” 

She shook her head wildly. 
“That’s . that’s . .” 

“A bitter pill,” he said, 
watching the guards run toward 
them across the roof, taking up 
their escort positions. 

“Bitter nonsense!” 

“The greatest palatinate earl 
and the lowliest stipendiary serf 
share the same problem. You 
cannot hire a mentat or any other 
intellect to solve it for you. 
There’s no writ of inquest or 
calling of witnesses to provide 
desired answers. No servant — or 
disciple — can dress the wound. 
You dress it yourself or continue 
bleeding for all to see.” 

She whirled away from him, 

DUNE MESSIAH 


realizing in the instant of action 
what this betrayed about her own 
feelings. Without wile of voice or 
witch-wrought trickery, he had 
reached into her psyche once 
more. How did he do this? 

“What have you told him to 
do?” she whispered. 

“I told him to judge, to impose 
order.” 

Alia stared out at the guard, 
marking just how patiently they 
waited there — how very orderly. 
“To dispense justice,” she mur- 
mured. 

“Not that!” he snapped. I 
suggested that he judge, no more, 
guided by one overriding princi- 
ple. .” 

“And that?” 

“To keep his friends and 
destroy his enemies.” 

“To judge unjustly, then.” 

i<\\] hat is justice? Two forces 
VY collide. Each may have the 
right in its own sphere. And here’s 
where an Emperor commands or- 
derly solutions. Those collisions 
he cannot prevent — he solves.” 
“How?” 

“In the simplest way: he 

decides.” 

“Keeping his friends and also 
destroying his enemies.” 

“Isn’t that stability? People 
want order, this kind or some 
other. They sit in the prison of 
their hungers and see that war 
has become the sport of the rich. 
That’s a dangerous form„ of 
sophistication. It’s disorderly.” 

“I will suggest to my brother 
that you are much too dangerous 
and must be destroyed,” she said. 

147 


“A solution I’ve already sug- 
gested,” he said. 

“And that’s why you are 
dangerous,” she said, measuring 
out her words. “You’ve mastered 
your passions.” 

“That is not why I ’ m 
dangerous.” Before she could 
move, he leaned across, gripped 
her chin in one hand, planted his 
lips on hers. 

It was a gentle kiss, brief. He 
pulled away and she stared at 
him with a shock leavened by 
glimpses of spasmodic grins on 
the faces of her guardsmen still 
standing at orderly attention 
outside. 

Alia put a finger to her lips. 
There’d been such a sense of 
familiarity about that kiss. His 
lips had been flesh of a future 
she’d seen in some prescient 
byway. 

Breast heaving, she said: “I 
should have you flayed.” 

“Because I’m dangerous?” 

“Because you presume too 
much!” 

“I presume nothing. I take 
nothing which is not first offered 
to me. Be glad I did not take 
all that was offered.” He opened 
his door, slid out. “Come along. 
We’ve dallied too long on a fool’s 
errand.” 

He strode toward the entrance 
dome beyond the pad. 

Alia leaped out, ran to match 
his stride. “I’ll tell him everything 
you’ve said and everything you 
did,” she said. 

“Good.” He held the door for 
her. 

“He will order you executed,” 

148 


she said, slipping quickly into the 
dome. 

“Why? Because I took the kiss 
I wanted?” He followed her, his 
movement forcing her back. The 
door slid closed behind him. 

“The kiss that you wanted!” 
Outrage filled her. 

“All right, Alia. The kiss you 
wanted, then.” 

He started to move around her 
toward the drop field. 

As though his movement had 
propelled her into heightened 
awareness, she realized his can- 
dor — the utter truthfulness of 
him. The kiss / wanted, she told 
herself. True. 

“Your truthfulness, that’s 
what’s dangerous,” she said, 
following him. 

“You return to the ways of 
wisdom,” he said, not breaking 
his stride. “A mentat could not 
have stated the matter more 
directly. Now — what is it you saw 
in the desert?” 

She grabbed his arm, forcing 
him to a halt. He’d done it 
again — shocked her mind into 
sharpened awareness. 

“I can’t explain it,” she said, 
“but I keep thinking of the face 
dancers. Why is that?” 

“That is why your brother sent 
you to the desert,” he said, nod- 
ding. “Tell him of this persistent 
thought.” 

“But why?” She shook her 
head. “Why face dancers?” 

“There’s a young woman dead 
out there,” he said. “Perhaps no 
young woman is reported missing 
among the Fremen.”

rather than “Every time I do the

“You have to learn the rules”

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


Thus, Bug Jack Barron, by 
Norman Spinrad (Walker & Co., 
$5.95), a good book, an excellent 
idea and a fair piece of writing, 
is doomed to be obscured forever 
inside an expanding shell of 
churned gases. For the one thing 
you are not going to get, either 
from the editors who refused 
to buy it without changes or 
from the author who says words 
to the effect that the suggested 
changes were unconscionable, is 
a calm consideration of the ob- 
vious merits of this dirty, revolu- 
tionary, rabble-rousing screed. 

As I say, this happens every 
so often. But let me tell you Bug 
Jack Barron’s story: 

Jack Barron, as a young 
university student, founded a third 
political party from a coalition 
of white and black social justice 
activists. The blacks apparently 
predominate, for one of them has 
become governor of Mississippi 
in the new city of Evers. More 
background on the SJS may be 
gathered from the fact that its 
founders still pride themselves in 
their undergraduate nickname of 
the Baby Bolsheviks. 

Having grown a little older. 
Jack Barron one day appeared 
' on a TV interview program called 
the Joe Swynne Show. Instead 
of being made a fool of, he turned 
the tables on Old Joe so magnifi- 
cently that Jack was given his 
own show, and Joe has disap- 
peared from the public eye. The 

149 


show is now six years old, has 
an audience of 100,000,000, is 
a Wednesday-night viewing habit 
for statesmen, social outcasts, 
heads of all descriptions and other 
power brokers. It is called “Bug 
Jack Barron”; audience members 
call in on their vidphones, and 
Jack listens to what’s bugging 
them, frequently also ringing in 
some representatives of whatever 
institution or trend is grinding 
down the original caller. Given 
vidphone facilities such as we will 
have in commercial service by the 
time of this story, Barron has 
a completely viable and effective 
format. 

He is also considered to have 
sold out the SJS for pelf. This 
widely held opinion among his 
former comrades has caused his 
wife, Sara, to abandon him and 
become a Village fixture. But Jack 
is a howling commercial success 
and every Wednesday night after 
the show picks up a new blond 
bedmate resembling Sara. 

Finally, there is the fascinating 
background political situation, 
whose salient organizational 
features, apart from the rise of 
the SJS, are the severe erosion 
of the GOP “which has elected 
only two presidents since Hoover” 
in a book written before Novem- 
ber, 1968, and the division of 
the Democratic Party into the 
faction of Teddy the Pretender 
and the far more powerful 
establishment which is sponsoring 

150 


a candidate also named Ted. 
(Hennering, in this case. Spinrad 
repeatedly assigns to his congruent 
characters similar names, for no 
apparent reason.) Given the 
relative impotence of both the 
newborn SJS and the moribund 
GOP, Hennering is the shoo-in 
bet. This is especially true because t 
his sponsor is Benedict Howards, 
the rather mysterious, reclusive, 
fabulously wealthy Southwestern 
multibillionaire who controls the 
only commercially successful 
death-freezing process and is 
fighting hard to gain a monopoly 
by disguising the enterprise as- a 
privately owned utility. 

Okay, now there we are. What 
happens thereafter is that through 
his program Jack Barron stumbles 
across Benedict Howards’s real 
mission, which is to market the 
immortality treatment his doctors 
have perfected and to conceal the 
fact that the treatment involves 
gland transplants from children. 
Meanwhile, as these steps are oc- 
curring, Barron becomes the 
presidential candidate of the 
GOP-SJS coalition that forms 
when Bug Jack Barron’s ratings 
zoom, and Sara returns to Jack 
as Benedict Howards’s emissary, 
in the mistaken belief that she 
is doing good. And all of this 
eventually resolves when Jack 
takes Howards apart on his show. 

It is in the paragraph above, 

I think, that you will find the 
area in which judgment was exer- 

GALAXY 


cised to the detriment of this 
book’s appearance in print when it 
was first written. 

For instance, an editor might 
very well ask if this plot summary 
does not in fact ring a little bit 
like an adolescent wish-fulfillment 
fantasy. And he or another editor 
who has some acquaintanceship 
with the real depth of even the 
average national political action 
might ask whether Spinrad doesn’t 
make everything much too super- 
ficial and easy. A nit-picker such 
as myself might then chime in 
to wonder why Sara on Page 
XXX, for example, is revealed 
to have been motivated in an 
earlier action by something she 
doesn’t even learn about until 
page XXXI. All of these are valid 
criticisms, and could be accompa- 
nied by as many more as one 
wished to make. But they are not 
valid criticisms on a valid level. 

On that valid level, these are 
things either no more serious than 
similar features in a score of suc- 
cessful books published that same 
day, or else they are easily 
reparable with a half-hour’s worth 
of blue penciling. (By the way, 
I have never seen an editor use 
a literally blue pencil). We are 
dealing here in a story with the 
lineaments of classic tragedy, and 
in that mode, as Roger Zelazny 
and several others have demon- 
strated, you are allowed to have 
people do the right things for silly 
reasons, and vice versa. 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


Or, let’s cut through the knot: 
Spinrad is also the author of The 
Men in The Jungle, a book most 
people would find ludicrous, 
which I find inept, and which, 
except that it lacks some of the 
words in Jack, is equally “dirty.” 
He does not appear to have had 
any trouble getting that one 
published. This fact alone, in my 
mind, constitutes a sufficient piece 
of evidence that merit is far from 
the only consideration in the buy- 
ing of commercial literature. 

Jack may not be the most ept 
piece of word-cobbling under the 
sun. In fact, I think that the next 
time Spinrad permits himself to 
write a book with an ordinary 
theme, his basic weaknesses as 
a plot constructor and motivator 
will not only be still as obvious 
as they were in Jungle, they will 
be easily visible in retrospect in 
Jack, where they don’t really 
matter. The point I think is that 
Spinrad often uses representations 
of things, rather than the things 
themselves, and this doesn’t al- 
ways work. People in his stories 
have a habit of acting as if they 
were reacting to emotional crises 
which in fact Spinrad is rather 
weak at depicting. The reactions, 
however, are valid. Or, now, try 
this for the best example: 

The culminating horror of the 
Howards immortality treatment 
is that it involves irradiating the 
(unspecified) glands of pre- 
adolescent children and then 

151 


transplanting them into the 
hopeful bodies of the immortals. 
This does make Howards a villain 
supreme, because he is then able 
to deliberately offer this filthy im- 
mortality to the frail side of Jack’s 
human nature. And it makes sense 
in terms of Spinrad’s very well 
drawn background locale that 
most of the children surreptitiously 
purchased from their parents 
would be black, because a high 
percentage of our poor and gulli- 
ble are black. 

But considered as science fic- 
tion, this is incredible. In two 
ways. The process is barely 
described, because it is absolute 
nonsense to claim that you can 
beneficially transform the nature 
of glands by dosing them with 
enough roentgens to literally rot 
the flesh of the bodies in which 
human ontology placed them. 
Second, it would not have taken 
much trouble to work up some 
more coherent, equally horrible 
rationale involving the same ele- 
ments. Then, clearly, since he 
didn’t take the trouble, we can 
see that Spinrad not only reached 
a prior artistic decision to have 
the immortality bribe involve the 
mutilation of black children, at 
no matter what the would-be cost 
to technological credibility, but he 
did not care enough about 
credibility to even be graceful. 
You see what I mean about rep- 
resentations of things. 

This is a book that drifts in 

152 


and out between the realistic and 
the symbolic, each time taking 
what we may assume Spinrad 
thought was the best of either 
choice. It has a lot of what I 
tell my children are “grown-up 
words” in it — not without a cer- 
tain irony (on my part), since 
they are for sale in the same 
places that sell comic books, and 
in rather more explicit usage, too. 
All of that very quickly just be- 
comes part of the vehicle. What 
remains is a flawed but acceptable 
telling of a magnificent story; a 
representation of nobility, one 
might say, with a Mickey Mouse 
ending. 

A book I enjoyed the daylights 
out of this month was Willard 
Bain’s Informed Sources (Dou- 
bleday, $2.95), an 8 Vi" x 11" 
paperback, which is about the 
death of Cock Robin and the end 
of the world. It is, however, writ- 
ten in the form of copy ripped 
right off the Teletype machines 
of Informed Sources, a fictional 
(?) press association which talks 
just like the AP and UPI, in 
jargon, cablese and filing code. 
On first reading, I found that it 
was only about half comprehen- 
sible (though wholly delightful, 
as we clever reviewers say) 
despite a certain tangential 
familiarity with the wire-service 
business. What I would have 
made of it in the days before I 
began hanging around city rooms, 

GALAXY 


I can’t imagine. It’s full of puns 
on the medium itself, plus inside 
cracks at the management and 
technical methods of real wire 
bureaus, the institution of com- 
mercial journalism, etc. Tf you can 
read a wire book, or if you have 
the patience to glean what you can 
from this funny and pernicious 
document, with its crazed para-

and BULLETIN C O R T E

Okay. Books we started and 
never, never finished: 

A. E. Van Vogt, The Silkie, 
(Ace). “A brilliant new novel of 
a science-created super-race. By 
the author of Sian, The Universe 
Maker, etc.” To my genuine 
regret, this brilliant new novel 
broke down very quickly, after 
an opening chapter which actually 
breathed with life and made me 
seriously wonder whether it wasn’t 
time to take a long, hard re- 
appraising look at a man who 
has not always been dealt with 
fairly by the literati, but who is 
not, sadly, good enough to 
crusade on behalf of. 

One short take on two books: 
Olympia Press — yes, Virginia, the 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


Olympia Press — has sent me two 
new novels, Oracle of the 
Thousand Hands, which is am- 
bitious, cleverly done for a 
pastiche, and dull, and Screen, 
which is brilliant. Screen, which 
I guess is the science-fiction one, 
has to do with the common wish 
to enter the screen, become Buster 
Crabbe and get to go places with 
Dale Arden. Who you actually 
get to go places with in this book 
is Sophia Loren, Liz Taylor, 
Brigitte Bardot and Doris Day. 
Both books are by Barry Malz- 
berg. 

And let me inform you, with 
great pleasure, that Doubleday has 
published Another Look at 
Atlantis and Fifteen Other Essays 
by Willy Ley, at $5.95. This is 
a long-overdue book, as they say, 
containing fascinating represent- 
ative samples from the column 
that has graced these pages ever 
since Galaxy began. For a detailed 
representation of the book’s 
merits, please turn to Mr. Ley’s 
column in this issue, which will. 
I’m sure, do more to endear you 
and fascinate you than could 
anything I would say. 

Which does not prevent me 
from saying that I stayed up all 
night re-reading old favorites, and 
discovering one or two I’d missed, 
and musing on how very many 
of us must have learned almost 
all we know about the world and 
about the nature of things from 
this astonishing gentleman.

“synchronous” with the sun, 
meaning that the orbital period 
of the probe would be equal to 
the period of rotation of the sun. 
The probe would seem to hover 
over one point of the sun’s 
equator and with some luck one 
might be able to follow the career 
of a sunspot from its birth to 
its final disappearance. Other 
things that have not been done 
yet are a mission to the minor 
planet Eros, which has part of 
its orbit between the orbits of 
the earth and of Mars, and a 
mission to a small comet. 

As I explained in an earlier 
column a mission to one of the 
small comets that has its 
perihelion near the orbit of earth 
would require a good deal of pre- 
liminary observational work be- 
cause the orbits of these small 
comets are not sufficiently well 
known. This may be the reason 
why the Europeans did not con- 
sider, or rejected, the idea of a 
mission to a comet. And this may 
also be the reason why a mission 
to Eros, which would really be 
somewhat easier than a mission 
to Mars, has not been investigated 
in detail. Astronomical interest in 
this very unusual asteroid was 
confined to observing it when it 
came close. While its orbit is 
reasonably well known, the 
knowledge is apparently not re- 
fined enough to permit the 
calculation of the orbit of a space 

154 


probe that has to accomplish a 
close flyby. 

But the orbit of Jupiter is well 
known. The planet can be seen 
all the time except when, at 
intervals of one year and one 
month, it passes behind the sun 
as seen from earth. 


E verybody knows Jupiter is the 
largest and most massive planet 
in our solar system. Few people 
realize just how massive it is. Its 
mass is equal to 317 earth masses; 
the mass of all the other planets 
combined is equal to only 129 
earth masses. Its volume is equal 
to 1312 earth volumes; the 
volume of all the other planets 
adds up to only 896 earth 
volumes. 

lovis pater, as the Romans 
called Jupiter, rotates on its axis 
in 9 hours and 55 minutes and 
the body of the planet is flattened 
by this fast rotation to an extent 
that can be clearly seen in a 
telescope. Measured from one 
point of its equator to the opposite 
point of its equator the diameter 
of the planet is 88,700 miles. 
Measured from pole to pole it 
is only 82,790 miles. How much 
of the planet is core, how much 
of it is “mantle” (consisting of 
ice, or solid gases, or both) and 
how much is gaseous atmosphere 
is something we don’t know, but 
the overall density is 1.334 times 
that of water. The orbital period 

GALAXY 


is 11.86 years but because the 
orbital period of the earth is only 
one year Jupiter is “in opposition” 
every 399 days. The term “in 
opposition,” originally just an as- 
trological term, means that Jupiter 
is in a place in the sky that is 
directly opposite to the place of 
the sun at the same moment; 
Jupiter, the earth and the sun will 
form a straight line. But even then 
the distance between the Earth 
and Jupiter is still 390 million 
miles. 

The orbit of Jupiter is only 
slightly inclined to the ecliptic, 
the plane of the earth’s orbit, 
namely by 1 degree and 18’/i 
minutes of arc. Still, because 
Jupiter’s orbit is so large the 
planet, in its two extreme posi- 
tions, will be about 13 million 
miles “above” or “below” the 
ecliptic, which fact can complicate 
the flightpath of a space probe 
at certain times. Whether this 
complication has to be taken into 
account or not depends entirely 
on the time the probe is sent 
on its way. If the takeoff time 
has been selected carefully, the 
probe can travel all the way stay- 
ing in the ecliptic and arrive at 
its goal when Jupiter moves 
through the ecliptic. The orbital 
motion of the planet, incidentally, 
is fairly slow, amounting to only 
8.08 miles per second. 

The reasons why Jupiter is of 
such great scientific interest are 
many. There is the question of 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


the depth of Jupiter’s atmosphere, 
the temperature of the planet’s 
“surface” (if it has a plainly de- 
fined surface), the surfaces of the 
large .moons of Jupiter, the 
mysterious red spot and quite a 
number of others. One interesting 
aspect is that Jupiter is the only 
planet in our solar system, in ad- 
dition to the earth, that is known 
to have a magnetic field. One of 
the surprises of the exploration 
of the nearby bodies in space by 
space probes was that our moon 
as well as the planets Venus and 
Mars were found to lack magnetic 
fields. As regards Mercury we 
don’t know yet, and the same lack 
of knowledge pertains to the large 
outer planets with the exception 
of Jupiter. 

Because Jupiter has a magnetic 
field it produces the same kind 
of irregularity — call it a bubble, 
if you like — in the solar wind as 
does the earth. The sub-atomic 
particles streaming out from the f 
sun are forced by the magnetic 
field to flow around the planet 
at some distance. Inside this 
“magnetopause,” as it is called, 
only relatively few but very 
energetic sub-atomic particles are 
found. A long distance beyond 
the planet the particles of the 
solar wind will flow together 
again. The region beyond the 
planet before the solar wind be- 
comes normal again is called the 
“magnetic tail.” 

The magnetic tail of our earth 

155 


is believed to be at least one 
million miles in length, that of 
Jupiter is probably about 100 
million miles long. The point 
where the magnetopause is closest 
to the planet is, of course, the 
subsolar point, the place where 
the sun is directly overhead. In 
the case of Jupiter the distance 
from the planet’s center to the 
subsolar point of the magneto- 
pause is very nearly twenty-five 
diameters of the planet, or about 
2.2 million miles in the sunward 
direction. This means that all four 
of the large moons of Jupiter are 
inside the magnetopause while our 
moon is outside the earth’s 
magnetopause, though it is touch- 
ed, on occasion, by our magnetic 
tail. 

T he fundamental problem for 
a Jupiter mission is how long a 
probe would need to reach Jupiter 
and what velocity is required. 
The shortest transfer ellipse that 
could be used at all with existing 
rockets would take 400 days; the 
so-called Hohmann orbit, which 
takes the longest time but requires 
the least fuel expenditure, would 
take 1000 days. Four possibilities 
have been calculated and they 
look like this: 

DURATION VELOCITY 


(days) 

(miles 

1000 

8.76 

800 

8.82' 

600 

9.13 

400 

10.07 


The Germans picked an in- 
termediate case, an 850-day flight 
that requires 8.8 miles per second, 
1.8 miles per second more than 
is needed to reach our moon. 

The next step was to see how 
much a Jupiter probe could weigh. 
An Atlas rocket with a Centaur 
rocket as the upper stage could 
deliver about 1200 pounds to the 
orbit of Jupiter along the 850-day 
flightpath. If a Titan 3C rocket 
with a Centaur as the upper stage 
were used the weight of the probe 
could be as high as 5500 pounds. 
The Jupiter V rocket could deliver 
nearly 20,000 pounds to Jupiter, 
but that won’t happen. For two 
reasons: the rocket is much too 
expensive and there is no need 
to send 20,000 pounds to Jupiter. 

If the weight of the probe can 
be kept drastically below the one 
thousand pound mark the mission 
could be flown using the Europa 
rocket of ELDO (European 
Launcher Development Organiza- 
tion) which, naturally, is what the 
Germans hope to do. 

During the 850 days the probe 
is underway the earth will comr 
plete two and one third orbits, 
while Jupiter will travel slightly 
less than one quarter of its orbit. 
At the time of arrival the earth 
will be almost as close to Jupiter 
as it can be, while the sun will 
be off to one side and therefore 
will not interfere with the 
transmission of data from the 
probe to the earth. 


156 


GALAXY 


Data transmission, or rather the 
power for data transmission, is 
a special problem in the case of 
a Jupiter probe. Solar panels, as 
used for probes to Venus and 
Mars, are virtually useless at 
Jupiter’s distance from the sun. 
In Jupiter’s orbit a square yard 
of panel surface would receive 
only 1/27 of the sunlight that 
is received at the orbit of earth. 
The inverse square law that is 
involved here just does not make 
any exceptions, no matter how 
worthy the cause. Hence the 
necessary power must be supplied 
in another way; the number of 
solar panels needed would be an 
unbearable weight penalty even if 
somebody could figure out how 
to mount them. 

~ Fuel cells for a flight duration 
of 850 days, plus a week or so 
of reserve power, would weigh 
even more, almost eight times as 
much as the solar panels. An 
atomic reactor like SNAP 10 A 
would fall about midway between 
solar panels and fuel cells. 

Fortunately there is one addi- 
tional possible power source, a 
battery based on a radioactive 
isotope of an element that is not 
normally radioactive. Here again 
the fact that the trip lasts 850 
days is important. Radioactive 
isotopes with a short half-life 
cannot be considered even if they 
had other factors in their favor. 
Nor is a long half-life the only 
consideration. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


R adioactive substances produce 
three kinds of radiation: alpha 
rays, which are actually the nuclei 
of helium atoms; beta rays, which 
are streams of electrons; and 
gamma rays, which are true rays 
like X-rays. A battery emitting 
X-rays would ruin quite a number 
of possible measurements. It 
would greatly reduce the effec- 
tiveness of the probe. An isotope 
emitting alpha particles only 
would generally be the best, but 
there are not many pure alpha 
emitters and not a single one is 
in ample supply. Beta particle 
emitters that do not emit X-rays 
are more numerous and can be 
used. Electrons that escape from 
the battery, when striking another 
part of the probe, will cause X- 
rays to be emitted where they 
strike. Fortunately the electrons 
are not very energetic as a rule, 
so that they can be stopped by 
a shield of some kind. Of course 
the shield will then emit X-rays, 
but the shield could be located 
in such a manner that the X-rays 
will go out into space and not 
touch another part of the probe. 

So we are now looking for an 
isotope that emits electrons only 
-and that has a useful half-life, 
at least twice as long as the travel 
time of the probe, but not too 
long. 

It is easy to see why an isotope 
with a half-life of, say, 500 years 
would not do. An isotope with 
a long half-life is evidently not 

157 


very active and we need a high 
degree of activity because we need 
energy. A half-life of about ten 
or twelve years would be about 
right; active enough to furnish 
energy, but not diminishing much 
in 2-1/3 years. 

Offhand one should think that 
a nice complete periodic table that 
lists all the known isotopes and 
their main characteristics should 
give us quite a choice. But when 
you check such a table you find 
out that half-lives either span 
thousands of years or are reckon- 
ed in minutes, hours and days. 
Only a very few isotopes have 
half-lives suitable for use in a 
Jupiter probe, and most of these 
must be disregarded for other 
reasons. There is, for example, 
radium-228 with a half-life of 6 
years which would be fine, but 
the isotope is much too rare since 
even the “common” radium 
isotope is a great rarity. There 
is holmium-166 with a half-life 
of not quite 30 years; it also is 
much too rare. There is tritium, 
triple-weight hydrogen, but that 
is the isotope that goes into the 
hydrogen bomb. And it is a gas, 
of course, which may have 
drawbacks for the intended pur- 
pose. 

The best suited isotope is one 
with a bad reputation due to 
fallout discussions, namely stron- 
tium-90 with a half-life of 28 
years. Strontium-90 is a beta 
emitter, does not emit X-rays 

158 


directly and is a metal with a 
melting point at 800 p Celsius. 
( 1472° Fahrenheit). 

The power consumption of the 
probe has been estimated to be 
between 200 and 300 watts; the 
transmitter must have a minimum 
of 33 watts, preferably a little 
more. A strontium-90 battery 
would be capable of furnishing 
these amounts, though it may be 
necessary to add a storage battery 
to take care of the peak load 
that will develop during the actual 
flyby. 


T he overall shape of American 
space probes, Surveyor as well 
as Mariner, has always reminded 
observers of giant insects, largely 
because of the winglike solar 
panels. The projected shape of 
the European Jupiter probe does 
not resemble an insect, or 
anything else for that matter. 

The base of the probe is an 
antenna dish slightly over 8 feet 
in diameter. A round box with 
a diameter of 5 feet and 7 inches 
and a depth of about 38 inches 
is mounted on top of the antenna 
dish. This box will hold the scien- 
tific instrumentation and the elec- 
tronic gear, expected to have an 
overall weight of 220 pounds. 
Tubular struts which begin at the 
rim of the antenna dish and which 
also hold the instrument box in 
place will meet about 5 Vi feet 
above the upper lid of the box 

GALAXY 


to form an apex. The isotope bat- 
tery will be mounted on that apex, 
to be as far from the instruments 
as is possible in such a configura- 
tion. In the empty space above 
the box the fuel tank and rocket 
chambers for the midcourse 
engine are mounted, which puts 
the exhaust nozzle roughly in the 
center of gravity of the whole 
probe. For attitude correction ad- 
ditional cold gas thrusters are 
mounted around the rim of the 
antenna dish. 

The maximum diameter of the 
probe would be just about 8 Vi 
feet, the overall height close to 
13 Vi feet and the overall weight 
is estimated at about 1100 


pounds. This is just about, as has 
been mentioned earlier, what an 
Atlas-Centaur rocket could move 
to Jupiter. For the Euro pa rocket 
it is too heavy. 

Of course the Europeans have 
some development plans for 
something larger and more 
powerful than the Europa, though 
nobody can say at what time these 
plans might turn into reality. A 
collaboration of more than half 
a dozen countries, at least two 
of them in financial difficulties, 
is no simple thing. 

But in the meantime it is nice 
to know that existing American 
rockets could send a Jupiter probe 
on its way. — WILLY LEY 


GLASSY ELECTRONICS 


Did you know that a new inven- 
tion — the glassistor — has joined 
the transistor as an electronic 
switch and amplifier? It's nothing 
more than a thin film of special 
glass that has the ability to vary 
its resistance under the influence 
of a control voltage. Coated 
directly onto wires, it takes even 
less space than the transistor. It 
should be helpful in designing 
electronic brains small enough for 
robots! 

It has another advantage. In the 
past, the electronic systems of or- 
biting satellites have been harmed 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


by the radiation in space. But the 
glassistor's characteristics are not 
affected by such radiation. 

From a military view, though, 
glassistors may prove a mixed 
blessing. Our proposed anti-ballistic 
missiles (the ones kicking up all the 
fuss) depend on the ABM emitting 
a blast of X-rays that will destroy 
the directing electronics of at- 
tacking missiles. With the glassistor 
in those missiles, they would be 
invulnerable to anything but a 
direct hit — difficult to guarantee, 
given the present state of the ABM 
art.

RESCUE TEAM 

by Lester del Rey 


C 6117 hat on earth for?” 
|| President Moody is said 
to have asked when told that huge 
funds were needed to develop a 
robot. To which the Secretary of 
Space replied: “For nothing on 
Earth, ma’am!” 

The story is probably apocry- 
phal, since robots antedate her 
administration. Plans for a crude, 
self-guided machine to explore 
Mars date back to the legendary 
Sputnik age. But certainly space 
flight made the robot necessary. 
Men are designed for Earth’s at- 
mosphere, but robots can work in 
a vacuum or on alien planets 
where man can go only after a ro- 
bot task force has prepared the 
way. The human cargo on the first 
stellar expeditions slept in frozen 
suspension, cared for by a robot 
crew until the new colony worlds 
were made safe for them. It is only 
natural that modern stellar colo- 
nies are ruled as often by robots 
as by men. 

In fact, it was taken as axio- 
matic that no technical race could 
distrust these intelligent products 
of technology. Or so it was before 
our messages from the Roger 
MecbNab Expedition. 

MechNab’s mission was to ex- 
plore a star that had just turned 
red giant and to test our theories 
that such a star is one that has 
used up its hydrogen fuel — in 
switching to helium, it cools and 


expands to engulf the orbits of its 
planets. The expedition found 
proof of the theories — and much 
more. 

Half a light-year from the 
ruined sun, a huge ship was lo- 
cated. We had finally met an alien 
race — one badly in need of rescue, 
since its ship was too primitive, 
however brave the effort. 

Robots sped at once toward the 
ship to offer aid, while men pre- 
pared to follow on mobile plat- 
forms. But rather than being wel- 
comed, the robots were immedi- 
ately attacked by dozens of tiny 
ships. Men armed and rushed to 
help, but not before a number of 
robots were injured. Pederson’s 
cover shows a rear-guard robot 
hurtling toward a human friend 
for assistance, as described by 
space phone. 

Fortunately the aliens recog- 
nized men as protoplasmic fellow 
beings and a truce was arranged. 
Their initial hostility had been 
caused by their incredible psycho- 
pathic fear of mechanical life. We 
understand their ship is being 
towed to our system now, and it 
is hoped the aliens will soon lose 
their peculiar belief that anything 
not of flesh and blood is less than 
human. 

No pictures of the aliens are 
available as yet. But it is reported 
that their form is rather beautiful 
— not unlike a terrestrial octopus.
