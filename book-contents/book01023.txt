What Strange Powers 

Did The Ancients Possess? 















"EVERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to self- 
advancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and suc- 
cessful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of natures laws, accumulat- 
ed through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of 1% of the earth's 
people were thought capable of receiv- 
ing basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which “whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weak- 
nesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example: The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleep- 
ing. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of self- 
understanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world's 
oldest institutions, first known in Amer- 
ica in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosi- 
crucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the “Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the ini- 
tials “AMORC." The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a com- 
mercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, “The Mastery of Life.” 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe

ALL BUT THE SQUEAL 



INDITING GALAXY has some 
"rich rewards — copping all the 
International Fantasy Awards 
for 1954, for instance, and, in the 
four years since its birth, finding 
it has become the most widely 
read science fiction magazine in 
the world. 

On the other hand, getting the 
130 or so stories we present every 
year means slogging wearily 
through thousands of manu- 
scripts, eyes bloodshot, but hopes 
high that, somewhere in this 
mountain, there will be the rare 
gems that make the hunt worth 
while. 

They’re there, of course, as you 
see each month, for we make it 
our business to discover new tal- 
ent. 

Speaking of business, however, 
any really efficient one makes 
full use of its by-products. We’re 
losing out on that score. Remem- 
ber how kerosene refineries pour- 
ed away gasoline, gold mines 
dumped uranium and platinum, 
and slaughterers threw out glands 
along with liver and lights — all 
because no use was known for 
these now valuable items? 

I hate to confess it, but we’re 
doing the same wasteful thing. 
Let’s see if we can’t do a properly 
efficient job by closely examining 
the main categories and possibly 



finding a use for them. It should- 
n’t be too hard ; after all, we have 
our trained imaginations. 

• Here’s the plot in which the 
hero and heroine turn out to be 
Adam and Eve. 

• Ah, yes, the scientist who 
manufactures a miniature uni- 
verse in the lab and discovers 
life on a planet that is circling 
a tiny sun. His name, we learn, 
is Yah Veh. 

• The spaceship crew that comes 
upon an absolutely ideal world, 
where the inhabitants don’t know 
violence of any sort . and then 
leave hastily because, it seems, 
Man brings hatred and greed 
wherever he goes. Our boys hate 
to take off, naturally, but if they 
stay, they will inflict madness on 
the innocent natives. 

• The dictator-ridden society in 
which — you can fill it out from 
there. Everybody is downtrodden 
and miserable. Our herb, gener- 
ally with the aid of a sidekick 
and/or maiden, kicks over the 
entire society with a flick of the 
wrist-radio. Oddly, in spite of 
having been conditioned to their 
civilization from birth, the inhab- 
itants all react exactly as if they 
had been raised in ours. 

• This is a sub-division of the 
plot immediately above — a girl 
in a parthenogenetic society risks 



4 



GALAXY science fiction 




the death penalty because she 
obstinately insists on having a 
baby in the old-fashioned way. 
Does that sound reasonable? For 
one thing, any society inevitably 
creates attitudes; Huxley’s Brave 
New World gave one solution — 
“mother” became a word to snig- 
ger over. And how many women 
demand the right to beat their 
laundry on river stones instead of 
using soul -destroying washing 
machines? 

• Let’s not overlook the post- 
atomic mutation story in which 
kids are destroyed because, being 
freaks, they have only ten fingers 
and toes. 

• Oh, and there’s the yarn about 
the spectacularly advanced ex- 
traterrestrial race that very be- 
nevolently keeps us from having 
space flight until we are worthy 
of it. Seems we’ll spread greed 
and hatred wherever we go. (Re- 
member the innocent race that 
went mad when our crew landed 
on their world.) 

• Another sub-division — aliens, 
no less spectacularly advanced, 
have seen our A-bomb blasts, 
know we’ll have H-bombs and 
worse before long, will inexor- 
ably blow up our mudball . and 
in some way disrupt the fabric 
of the Universe, endangering peo- 
ple thousands of light-years 
away. I guess this makes sense, 
since so many writers have done 
the story, but why are bomb 



blasts more dangerous to this 
mystical fabric of the Universe 
than novas? 

• The super-computer that, given 
the problem of how to bring peace 
to the world, goes insane because 
it has no answer. That’s down- 
right silly. Go into any bar and 
you’ll get more answers than 
you’ll know what to do with. 

There are many others, but 
these ought to do as a starter. 
Can’t do everything at once, you 
know. Rome wasn’t built in a 
day, according to recent news 
dispatches, and our industries in 
many cases took years to learn 
how to use by-products, which, 
in case you’ve forgotten, was the 
purpose behind all this. 

As I mentioned, putting out 
GALAXY is rewarding, but it’s 
hardly a cinch. These and simi- 
lar stories, though, come in so 
relentlessly that we could pub- 
lish Greed & Hatred Science Fic- 
tion, Tales of Jehovah, Dictator 
Stories, Adams & Eves, Mother's 
Space Journal and so on weekly. 

There’s only one hitch: 

Enough writers turn out these 
things to support a magazine in 
each category, but would they 
be willing to read each other’s 
versions? 

No, I guess not. 

There probably is no use what- 
ever for this literary sludge. It’s 
a shame — there’s so much of it.

ALL BUT THE SQUEAL 



5 





ROBERT SHECKtEY 



Wanted: one man to do a totally impossible 
job. Salary: the knowledge that a planet's 
life depends upon his being able to do it! 



rliOM Fisher had no idea he was 
about to begin a criminal ca- 
reer. It was morning. The big red 
sun was just above the horizon, 
trailing its small yellow compan- 
ion. The village, tiny and precise, 
a unique white dot on the planet’s 
green expanse, glistened under its 
two midsummer suns. 

Tom was just waking up in- 
side his cottage. He was .a tall. 



tanned young man, with his fath- 
er’s oval eyes and his mother’s 
easygoing attitude toward exer- 
tion. He was in no hurry; there 
could be no fishing until the fall 
rains, and therefore no real work 
for a Fisher. Until fall, he was 
going to loaf and mend his fish- 
ing poles. 

“It’s supposed to have a red 
roof!” he heard Billy Painter 





shouting outside. 

“Churches never have red 
roofs!” Ed Weaver shouted back. 

Tom frowned. Not being in- 
volved, he had forgotten the 
changes that had come over the 
village in the last two weeks. He 
slipped on a pair of pants and 
sauntered out to the village 
square. 

The first thing he saw when he 
entered the square was a large 
new sign, reading: NO ALIENS 
ALLOWED WITHIN CITY 
LIMITS. There were no aliens 
on the entire planet of New Del- 
aware. There was nothing but 
forest, and this one village. The 
sign was purely a statement of 
policy. 

The square itself contained a 
Church, a Jail and a Post Office, 
all constructed in the last two 
frantic weeks and set in a aeat 
row facing the market. No one 
knew what to do with these build- 
ings; the village had gone along 
nicely without them for over two 
hundred years. But now, of 
course, they had to be built. 

IT'D Weaver was standing in 
front of the new Church, 
squinting upward. Billy Painter 
was balanced precariously on the 
Church’s steep roof, his blond 
mustache bristling indignantly. A 
small crowd had gathered. 

“Damn it, man,” Billy Painter 
was saying, “I tell you I was 



reading about it just last week. 
White roof, okay. Red roof, 
never.” 

“You’re mixing it up with 
something else,” Weaver said. 
“How about it, Tom?” 

Tom shrugged, having no 
opinion to offer. Just then, the 
Mayor bustled up, perspiring 
freely, his shirt flapping over his 
large paunch. 

“Come down,” he called to 
Billy. “I just looked it up. It’s 
the Little Red Schoolhouse, not 
Churchhouse.” 

Billy looked angry. He had 
always been moody; all Painters 
were. But since the Mayor made 
him Chief of Police last week, he 
had become downright tempera- 
mental. 

“We don’t have no Little 
Schoolhouse,” Billy argued, half- 
way down the ladder. 

“We’ll just have to build one,” 
the Mayor said. “We’ll have to 
hurry, too.” He glanced at the 
sky. Involuntarily, everyone in 
the crowd glanced upward. But 
there was still nothing in sight. 

“Where are the Carpenter 
boys?” the Mayor asked. “Sid, 
Sam, Marv — where are you?” 

Sid Carpenter’s head appeared 
through the crowd. He was still 
on crutches from last month when 
he had fallen out of a tree look- 
ing for threstle’s eggs; no Car- 
penter was worth a damn at tree- 
climbing.

“The other boys are at Ed 
Beer’s Tavern,” Sid said. 

“Where else would they be?” 
Mary Waterman called from the 
crowd. 

“Well, you gather them up,” 
the Mayor said. “They gotta 
build us a Little Schoolhouse, and 
quick. Tell them to put it up be- 
side the Jail.” He turned to Billy 
Painter, who was back on the 
ground. “Billy, you paint that 
Schoolhouse a good bright red, 
inside and out. It’s very impor- 
tant.” 

“When do I get a Police Chief 
badge?” Billy demanded. “I read 
that Police Chiefs always get 
badges.” 

“Make yourself one,” the 
Mayor said. He mopped his face 
with his shirt-tail. “Sure hot. 
Don’t know why that Inspector 
couldn’t have come in winter . 
Tom! Tom Fisher! Got an impor- 
tant job for you. Come on, I’ll 
tell you all about it.” 

He put an arm around Tom’s 
shoulders and they walked to the 
Mayor’s cottage past the empty 
market, along the village’s single 
paved road. In the old days, that 
road had been of packed dirt. 
But the old days had ended two 
weeks ago and now the road 
was paved with crushed rock. It 
made barefoot walking so un- 
comfortable that the villagers 
simply cut across each other’s 
lawns. The Mayor, though, walk- 



ed on it out of principle. 

“Now look, Mayor,” Tom pro- 
tested, “I’m on my vacation — ” 

“Can’t have any vacations 
now,” the Mayor said. “Not now. 
He’s due any day.” He ushered 
Tom inside his cottage and sat 
down in the big armchair, which 
had been pushed as close to the 
Interstellar Radio as possible. 

“Tom,” the Mayor said direct- 
ly, “how would you like to be a 
criminal?” 

“I don’t know,” said Tom. 
“What’s a Criminal?” 

OQUIRMING uncomfortably 
^ in his chair, the Mayor rested 
a hand on the Radio for author- 
ity. “It’s this way,” he said, and 
began to explain. 

Tom listened, but the more he 
heard, the less he liked. It was all 
the fault of that Interstellar 
Radio, he decided. Why hadn’t 
it really been broken? 

No one had believed it could 
work. It had gathered dust in 
the office of one Mayor after 
another, for generations, the last 
silent link with Mother Earth. 
Two hundred years ago, Earth 
talked with New Delaware, and 
with Ford IV, Alpha Centauri, 
Nueva Espana, and the other 
colonies that made up the United 
Democracies of Earth. Then all 
conversations stopped. 

There seemed to be a war on 
Earth. New Delaware, with its 



SKULKING PERMIT

one village, was too' small and 
too distant to take part. They 
waited for news, but no news 
came. And then plague struck 
the village, wiping out three- 
quarters of the inhabitants. 

Slowly the village healed. The 
villagers adopted their own ways 
of doing things. They forgot 
Earth. 

Two hundred years passed. 

And then, two weeks ago, the 
ancient Radio had coughed itself 
into life. For hours, it growled 
and spat static, while the inhab- 
itants of the village gathered 
around the Mayor’s cottage. 

Finally words came out: “. 
hear me. New Delaware? Do you 
hear me?” 

“Yes, yes, we hear you,” the 
Mayor said. 

“The colony is still there?” 

“It certainly is,” the Mayor 
said proudly. 

The voice became stern and of- 
ficial. “There has been no contact 
with the Outer Colonies for some 
time, due to unsettled conditions 
here. But that’s over, except for 
a little mopping up. You of 
New Delaware are still a colony 
of Imperial Earth and subject to 
her laws. Do you acknowledge 
the status?” 

The Mayor hesitated. All the 
books referred to Earth as the 
United Democracies. Well, in two 
centuries, names could change. 

“We are still loyal to Earth,” 



the Mayor said with dignity. 

“Excellent. That saves us the 
trouble of sending an expedition- 
ary force. A Resident Inspector 
will be dispatched to you from 
the nearest point, to ascertain 
whether you conform to the cus- 
toms, institutions and traditions 
of Earth.” 

“What?” the Mayor asked, 
worried. 

T HE stem voice became higher- 
pitched. “You realize, of 
course, that there is room for only 
one intelligent species in the Uni- 
verse — Man! All others must be 
suppressed, wiped out, annihil- 
ated. We can tolerate no aliens 
sneaking around us. I’m sure you 
understand, General.” 

“I’m not a General. I’m a 
Mayor.” 

“You’re in charge, aren’t you?” 
“Yes, but — ” 

“Then you are a General. Per- 
mit me to continue. In this gal- 
axy, there is no room for aliens. 
None! Nor is there room for de- 
viant human cultures, which, by, 
definition, are alien. It is impos- 
sible to administer an empire 
when everyone does as he pleases. 
There must be order, no matter 
what the cost.” 

The Mayor gulped hard and 
stared at the radio. 

“Be sure you’re running an 
Earth colony, General, with no 
radical departures from the norm, 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




such as free will, free love, free 
elections, or anything else on 
the proscribed list. Those things 
are alien, and we’re pretty rough 
on aliens. Get your colony in 
order, General. The Inspector 
will call in about two weeks. That 
is all.” 

The village held an immediate 
meeting, to determine how best 
to conform with the Earth man- 
date. All they could do was hast- 
ily model themselves upon the 
Earth pattern as shown in their 
ancient books. 

“I don’t see why there has to 
be a Criminal,” Tom said. 

“That’s a very important part 
of Earth society,” the Mayor ex- 
plained. “All the books agree on 
it. The Criminal is as important 
as the Postman, say, or the Police 
Chief. Unlike them, the Criminal 
is engaged in anti -social work. 
He works against society, Tom. 
If you don’t have people working 
against society, how can you have 
people working for it? There’d be 
no jobs for them to do.” 

Tom shook his head. “I just 
don’t see it.” 

“Be reasonable, Tom. We have 
to have Earthly things. Like 
Paved Roads. All the books men- 
tion that. And Churches, and 
Schoolhouses, and Jails. And all 
the books mention Crime.” 

“I won’t do it,” Tom said. 

“Put yourself in my position,” 
the Mayor begged. “This In- 



spector comes and meets Billy 
Painter, our Police Chief. He 
asks to see the jail. Then he says, 
‘No Prisoners?’ I answer, ‘Of 
course not. We don’t have any 
Crime here.’ ‘No Crime?’ he says. 
‘But Earth colonies always have 
Crime. You know that.’ ‘We 
don’t,’ I answer. ‘Didn’t even 
know what it was until we looked 
up the word last week.’ ‘Then 
why did you build a Jail?’ he 
asks me. ‘Why did you appoint 
a Police Chief?’ ” 

T HE Mayor paused for breath. 

“You see? The whole thing 
falls through. He sees at once 
that we’re not truly Earthlike. 
We’re faking it. We’re aliens!” 
“Hmm,” Tom said, impressed 
in spite of himself. 

“This way,” the Mayor went 
on quickly, “I can say, ‘Certainly 
we’ve got Crime here, just like 
on Earth. We’ve got a combina- 
tion Thief and Murderer. Poor 
fellow had a bad upbringing and 
he’s maladjusted. Our Police 
Chief has some clues, though. 
We expect an arrest within 24 
hours. We’ll lock him in the 
Jail, then Rehabilitate him.” 
“What’s Rehabilitate?” Tom 
asked. 

“I’m not sure. I’ll worry about 
that when I come to it. But now 
do you see how necessary crime 
is?” 

“I suppose so. But why me?” 



SKULKING PERMIT 



11 




“Can’t spare anyone else. And 
you’ve got narrow eyes. Crimin- 
als always have narrow eyes.” 
“They aren’t that narrow. 
They’re no narrower than Ed 
Weaver’s — ” 

“Tom, please,” the Mayor said. 
“We’re all doing our part. You 
want to help, don’t you?” 

“I suppose so,” Tom repeated 
wearily. 

“Fine. You're our Criminal. 
Here, this makes it legal.” 

He handed Tom a document. 
It read: SKULKING PERMIT. 
Know all Men by these Presents 
that Tom Fisher is a Duly Au- 
thorized Thief and Murderer. He 
is hereby required to Skulk in 
Dismal Alleys, Haunt Places of 
Low Repute, and Break the Law. 

Tom read it through twice, 
then asked, “What Law?” 

“I’ll let you know as fast as I 
make them up,” the Mayor said. 
“All Earth colonies have Laws.” 
“But what do I do?” 

“You Steal. And Kill. That 
should be easy enough.” The 
Mayor walked to his bookcase 
and took down ancient volumes 
entitled The Criminal and his 
Environment, Psychology of the 
Slayer, and Studies in Theft Mo- 
tivation. 

“These’ll give you everything 
you need to know. Steal as much 
as you like. One Murder should 
be enough, though. No sense 
overdoing it.” 



“Right,” Tom nodded. “I guess 
I’ll catch on.” 

He picked up the books and 
returned to his cottage. 

TT WAS very hot and all the 
talk about Crime had puzzled 
and wearied him. He lay down 
on his bed and began to go 
through the ancient books. 

There was a knock on his door. 

“Come in,” Tom called, rub- 
bing his tired eyes. 

Marv Carpenter, oldest and 
tallest of the red-headed Carpen- 
ter boys, came in, followed by 
old Jed Farmer. They were 
carrying a small sack. 

“You the town Criminal, 
Tom?” Marv asked. 

“Looks like it.” 

“Then this is for you.”* They 
put the sack on the floor and took 
from it a hatchet, two knives, a 
short spear, a club and a black- 
jack. 

“What’s all that?” Tom asked, 
sitting upright. 

“Weapons, of course,” Jed 
Farmer said testily. “You can’t 
be a real Criminal without weap- 
ons.” 

Tom scratched his head. “Is 
that a fact?” 

“You’d better start figuring 
these things out for yourself,” 
Farmer went on in his impatient 
voice. “Can’t expect us to do 
everything for you.” 

Marv Carpenter winked at 



12

Tom. “Jed’s sore because the 
Mayor made him our Postman.” 

“I’ll do my part,” Jed said. 
“I just don’t like having to write 
all those letters.” 

“Can’t be too hard,” Marv 
Carpenter said, grinning. “The 
Postmen do it on Earth and they 
got a lot more people there. 
Good luck, Tom.” 

They left. 

Tom bent down and examined 
the weapons. He knew what they 
were; the old books were full of 
them. But no one had ever ac- 
tually used a weapon on New 
Delaware. The only native ani- 
mals on the planet were small, 
furry, and confirmed eaters of 
grass. As for turning a weapon on 
a fellow villager — why would 
anybody want to do that? 

He picked up one of the knives. 
It was cold. He touched the point. 
It was sharp. 

Tom began to pace the floor, 
staring at the weapons. They 
gave him a queer sinking feeling 
in the pit of his stomach. He de- 
cided he had been hasty in ac- 
cepting the job. 

But there was no sense worry- 
ing about it yet. He still had 
those books to read. After that, 
perhaps he could make some 
sense out of the whole thing. 

TTE READ for several hours, 
stopping only to eat a light 
lunch. The books were under- 



standable enough; the various 
Criminal methods were clearly 
explained, sometimes with dia- 
grams. But the whole thing was 
unreasonable. What was the pur- 
pose of Crime? Whom did it 
benefit? What did people get out 
of it? 

The books didn’t explain that. 
He leafed through them, looking 
at the photographed faces of 
Criminals. They looked very seri- 
ous and dedicated, extremely 
conscious of the significance of 
their work to society. 

Tom wished he could find out 
what that significance was. It 
would probably make things 
much easier. 

“Tom?” he heard the Mayor 
call from outside. 

“I’m in here, Mayor,” Tom 
said. 

The door opened and the May- 
or peered in. Behind him were 
Jane Farmer, Mary Waterman 
and Alice Cook. 

“How about it, Tom?” the 
Mayor asked. 

“How about what?” 

“How about getting to work?” 

Tom grinned self-consciously. 
“I was going to,” he said. “I was 
reading these books, trying to 
figure out — ” 

The three middle-aged ladies 
glared at him, and Tom stopped 
in embarrassment. 

“You’re certainly taking your 
time reading,” Alice Cook said.

“Everyone else is outside work- 
ing,” said Jane Farmer. 

“What’s so hard about Steal- 
ing?” Mary Waterman challeng- 
ed. 

“It’s true,” the Mayor told 
him. “That Inspector might be 
here any day now and we don’t 
have a Crime to show him.” 

“All right, all right,” Tom said. 

He stuck a knife and a black- 



jack in his belt, put the sack 
in his pocket — for Loot — and 
stalked out. 

But where was he going? It 
was mid-afternoon. The market, 
which was the most logical place 
to rob, would be empty until eve- 
ning. Besides, he didn’t want to 



• • •:'*> - - 




commit a Robbery in daylight. It 
seemed unprofessional. 

He opened his Skulking Permit 



and read it through. Required to 
Haunt Places of Low Repute . 

That was it! He’d haunt a Low 
Repute Place. He could form 
some plans there, get into the 
mood of the thing. But unfortu- 
nately, the village didn’t have 
much to choose from. There was 
the Tiny Restaurant, run by the 
widowed Ames sisters, there was 
Jeff Hern’s Lounging Spot, and 
finally there was Ed Beer’s Tav- 
ern. 

Ed’s place would have to do. 



f J^HE Tavern was a cottage 
much like the other cottages 
in the village. It had one big 
room for guests, a kitchen, and 
family sleeping quarters. Ed’s 
wife did the cooking and kept the 
place as clean as she could, con- 
sidering her ailing back. Ed 
served the drinks. He was a pale, 
sleepy-eyed man with a talent for 
worrying. 

“Hello, Tom,” Ed said. “Hear 
you’re our Criminal.” 



SKULKING PERMIT

“That’s right,” said Tom. “I’ll 
take a perricola.” 

Ed Beer served him the non- 
alcoholic root extract and stood 
anxiously in front of Tom’s table. 
“How come you ain’t out Thiev- 
ing, Tom?” 

“I’m planning,” Tom said. 
“My Permit says I have to Haunt 
Places of Low Repute. That’s 
why I’m here.” 

“Is that nice?” Ed Beer asked 
sadly. “This is no Place of Low 
Repute, Tom.” 

“You serve the worst meals in 
town,” Tom pointed out. 

“I know. My wife can’t cook. 
But there’s a friendly atmosphere 
here. Folks like it.” 

“That’s all changed, Ed. I’m 
making this tavern my head- 
quarters.” 

Ed Beer’s shoulders drooped. 
“Try to keep a nice place,” he 
muttered. “A lot of thanks you 
get.” He returned to the bar. 

Tom proceeded to think. He 
found it amazingly difficult. The 
more he tried, the less came out. 
But he stuck grimly to it. 

An hour passed. Richie Farmer, 
Jed’s youngest son, stuck his head 
in the door. “You Steal anything 
yet, Tom?” 

“Not yet,” Tom told him, 
hunched over his table, still 
thinking. 

The scorching afternoon drift- 
ed slowly by. Patches of evening 
became visible through the Tav- 



ern’s small, not too clean win- 
dows. A cricket began to chirp 
outside, and the first whisper of 
night wind stirred the surround- 
ing forest. 

Big George Waterman and 
Max Weaver came in for a glass, 
of glava. They sat down beside 
Tom. 

“How’s it going?” George Wa- 
terman asked. 

“Not so good,” Tom said. 
“Can’t seem to get the hang of 
this Stealing.” 

“You’ll catch on,” Waterman 
said in his slow, ponderous, ear- 
nest fashion. “If anyone in this 
village could learn it, you can.” 

“We’ve got confidence in you, 
Tom,” Weaver assured him. 

Tom thanked them. They 
drank and left. He continued 
thinking, staring into his empty 
perricola glass. 

An hour later, Ed Beer clear- 
ed his throat apologetically. “It’s 
none of my business, Tom, but 
when are you going to Steal 
something?” 

“Right now,” Tom said. 

He stood up, made sure his 
weapons were securely in place, 
and strode out the door. 

N IGHTLY bartering had be- 
gun in the market. Goods 
were piled carelessly on benches, 
or spread over the grass on straw 
mats. There was no currency, no 
rate of exchange. Ten hand- 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




wrought nails were worth a pail 
of milk or two fish, or vice versa, 
depending on what you had to 
barter and needed at the moment. 
No one ever bothered keeping 
accounts. That was one Earth 
custom the Mayor was having 
difficulty introducing. 

As Tom Fisher walked down 
the square, everyone greeted him. 

“Stealing now, huh, Tom?” 

“Go to it, boy!” 

“You can do it!” 

No one in the village had ever 
witnessed an actual theft. They 
considered it an exotic custom of 
distant Earth and they wanted to 
see how it worked. They left 
their goods and followed Tom 
through the market, watching 
avidly. 

Tom found that his hands 
were trembling. He didn’t like 
having so many people watch 
him Steal. He decided he’d bet- 
ter work fast, while he still had 
the nerve. 

He stopped abruptly in front 
of Mrs. Miller’s fruit-laden 
bench. “Tasty-looking geefers,” 
he said casually. 

“They’re fresh,” Mrs. Miller 
told him. She was a small and 
bright-eyed old woman. Tom 
could remember long conversa- 
tions she had had with his moth- 
er, back when his parents were 
alive. 

“They look very tasty,” he 
said, wishing he had stopped 



somewhere else instead. 

“Oh, they are,” said Mrs. Mill- 
er. “I picked them just this af- 
ternoon.” 

“Is he going to Steal now?” 
someone whispered. 

“Sure he is. Watch him,” some- 
one whispered back. 

Tom picked up a bright green 
geefer and inspected it. The crowd 
became suddenly silent. 

“Certainly looks very tasty,” 
Tom said, carefully replacing the 
geefer. 

The crowd released a long- 
drawn sigh. 

Max Weaver and his wife and 
five children were at the next 
bench. Tonight they were dis- 
playing two blankets and a shirt. 
They all smiled shyly when Tom 
came over, followed by the crowd. 

“That shirt’s about your size,” 
Weaver informed him. He wished 
the people would go away and 
let Tom work. 

“Hmm,” Tom said, picking up 
the shirt. 

The crowd stirred expectantly. 
A girl began to giggle hysterical- 
ly. Tom gripped the shirt tightly 
and opened his Loot bag. 

“ ¥UST a moment!” Billy 
J Painter pushed his way 
through. He was wearing a badge 
now, an old Earth coin he had 
polished and pinned to his belt. 
The expression on his face was 
unmistakably official. 



SKULKING PERMIT

“What were you doing with 
that shirt, Tom?" Billy asked. 

“Why ... I was just looking 
at it.” 

“Just looking at it, huh?" Billy 
turned away, his hands clasped 
behind his back. Suddenly he 
whirled and extended a rigid 
forefinger. “I don’t think you 
were just looking at it, Tom. I 
think you were planning on Steal- 
ing it!” 

Tom didn’t answer. The tell- 
tale sack hung limply from one 
hand, the shirt from the other. 

“As Police Chief," Billy went 
on, “I’ve got a duty to protect 
these people. You’re a Suspicious 
Character. I think I’d better lock 
you up for further questioning." 

Tom hung his head. He hadn’t 
expected this, but it was just as 
well. 

Once he was in Jail, it would 
be all over. And when Billy re- 
leased him, he could get back to 
fishing. 

Suddenly the Mayor bounded 
through the crowd, his shirt flap- 
ping wildly around his waist. 

“Billy, what are you doing?” 

“Doing my duty, Mayor. Tom 
here is acting plenty suspicious. 
The book says—” 

“I know what the book says,” 
the Mayor told him. “I gave you 
the book. You can’t go arresting 
Tom. Not yet.” 

“But there’s no other Criminal 
in the village," Billy complained. 



“I can’t help that,” the Mayor 
said. 

Billy’s lips tightened. “The 
book talks about Preventive Po- 
lice Work. I’m supposed to stop 
Crime before it happens.” 

The Mayor raised his hands 
and dropped them wearily. “Bil- 
ly, don’t you understand? This 
village needs a Criminal record. 
You have to help, too.” 

Billy shrugged his shoulders. 
“All right, Mayor. I was just try- 
ing to do my job.” He turned to 
go. Then he whirled again on 
Tom. “I’ll still get you. Remem- 
ber — Crime Does Not Pay.” He 
stalked off. 

“He’s overambitious, Tom,” 
the Mayor explained. “Forget it. 
Go ahead and Steal something. 
Let’s get this job over with.” 

^TOM started to edge away to- 
-*• ward the green forest outside 
the village. 

“What’s wrong, Tom?” the 
Mayor asked worriedly. 

“I’m not in the mood any 
more,” Tom said. “Maybe to- 
morrow night — ” 

“No, right now,” the Mayor 
insisted. “You can’t go on put- 
ting it off. Come on, we’ll all 
help you.” 

“Sure we will,” Max Weaver 
said. “Steal the shirt, Tom. It’s 
your size anyhow.” 

“How about a nice water jug, 
Tom?” 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Look at these skeegee nuts 
over here.” 

Tom looked from bench to 
bench. As he reached for Wea- 
ver’s shirt, a knife slipped from 
his belt and dropped to the 
ground. The crowd clucked sym- 
pathetically. 

Tom replaced it, perspiring, 
knowing he looked like a butter- 
fingers. He reached out, took the 
shirt and stuffed it into the Loot 
Bag. The crowd cheered. 

Tom smiled faintly, feeling a 
bit better. “I think I’m getting 
the hang of it.” 

“Sure you are.” 

“We knew you could do it.” 

“Take something else, boy.” 

Tom walked down the market 
and helped himself to a length of 
rope, a handful of skeegee nuts 
and a grass hat. 

“I guess that’s enough,” he told 
the Mayor. 

“Enough for now,” the Mayor 
agreed. “This doesn’t really 
count, you know. This was the 
same as people giving it to you. 
Practice, you might say.” 

“Oh,” Tom said, disappointed. 

“But you know what you’re 
doing. The next time it’ll be just 
as easy.” 

“I suppose it will.” 

“And don’t forget that Mur- 
der.” 

“Is it really necessary?” Tom 
asked. 

“I wish it weren’t,” the Mayor 



said. “But this colony has been 
here for over two hundred years 
and we haven’t had a single Mur- 
der. Not one! According to the 
records, all the other colonies had 
lots.” 

“I suppose we should have 
one,” Tom admitted. “I’ll take 
care of it.” He headed for his 
cottage. The crowd gave a rous- 
ing cheer as he departed. 

A T home, Tom lighted a rush 
lamp and fixed himself sup- 
per. After eating, he sat for a 
long time in his big armchair. 
He was dissatisfied with himself. 
He had not really handled the 
Stealing well. All day he had 
worried and hesitated. People had 
practically had to put things in 
his hands before he could take 
them. 

A fine Thief he was! 

And there was no excuse for 
it. Stealing and Murdering were 
like any other necessary jobs. 
Just because he had never done 
them before, just because he could 
see no sense to them, that was no 
reason to bungle them. 

He walked to the door. It was 
a fine night, illuminated by a 
dozen nearby giant stars. The 
market was deserted again and 
the village lights were winking 
out. * 

This was the time to Steal! 

A thrill ran through him at the 
thought. He was proud of him- 



SKULKING PERMIT 



19 




self. That was how Criminals 
planned and this was how Steal- 
ing should be — skulking, late at 
night. 

Quickly Tom checked his 
weapons, emptied his Loot Sack 
and walked out. 

The last rush lights were ex- 
tinguished. Tom moved noise- 
lessly through the village. He 
came to Roger Waterman’s 
house. Big Roger had left his 
spade propped against a wall. 
Tom picked it up. Down the 
block, Mrs. Weaver’s water jug 
was in its usual place beside the 
front door. Tom took it. On his 
way home, he found a little wood- 
en horse that some child had 
forgotten. It went with the rest. 

He was pleasantly exhilarated, 
once the goods were safely home. 
He decided to make another haul. 

This time he returned with a 
bronze plaque from the Mayor’s 
house, Marv Carpenter’s best 
saw, and Jed Farmer’s sickle. 

“Not bad,” he told himself. He 
was catching on. One more load 
would constitute a good night’s 
work. 

This time he found a hammer 
and chisel in Ron Stone’s shed, 
and a reed basket at Alice Cook’s 
house. He was about to take Jeff 
Hern’s rake when he heard a faint 
noise. He flattened himself against 
a wall. 

Billy Painter came prowling 
quietly along, his badge gleaming 



in the starlight. In one hand, he 
carried a short, heavy club; in 
the other, a pair of homemade 
handcuffs. In the dim light, his 
face was ominous. It was the face 
of a man who had pledged him- 
self against Crime, even though 
he wasn’t really sure what it was. 

Tom held his breath as Billy 
Painter passed within ten feet of 
him. Slowly Tom backed away. 

The Loot Sack jingled. 

“Who’s there?” Billy yelled. 
When no one answered, he turned 
a slow circle, peering into the 
shadows. Tom was flattened 
against a wall again. He was 
fairly sure Billy wouldn’t see him. 
Billy had weak eyes because of 
the fumes of the paint he mixed. 
All Painters had weak eyes. It 
was one of the reasons they were 
moody. 

“Is that you, Tom?” Billy 
asked, in a friendly tone. Tom 
was about to answer, when he 
noticed that Billy’s club was 
raised in a striking position. He 
kept quiet. 

“I’ll get you yet!” Billy 
shouted. 

“Well, get him in the morn- 
ing!” Jeff Hern shouted from his 
bedroom window. “Some of us 
are trying to sleep.” 

Billy moved away. When he 
was gone, Tom hurried home and 
dumped his pile of Loot on the 
floor with the rest. He surveyed 
his haul proudly. It gave him the 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




sense of a job well done. 

After a cool drink of glava, 
Tom went to bed, falling at once 
into a peaceful, dreamless sleep. 

lYfEXT morning, Tom saunter- 

^ ed out to see how the Little 
Red Schoolhouse was progress- 
ing. The Carpenter boys were 
hard at work on it, helped by sev- 
eral villagers. 

“How’s it coming?” Tom called 
out cheerfully. 

“Fair,” Marv Carpenter said. 
“It’d come along better if I had 
my saw.” 

“Your saw?” Tom repeated 
blankly. 

After a moment, he remember- 
ed that he had stolen it last night. 
It hadn’t seemed to belong to 
anyone then. The saw and all 
the rest had been objects to be 
stolen. He had never given a 
thought to the fact that they 
might be used or needed. 

Marv Carpenter asked, “Do 
you suppose I could use the saw 
for a while? Just for an hour or 
so?” 

“I’m not sure,” Tom said, 
frowning. “It’s legally Stolen, you 
know.” 

“Of course it is. But if I could 
just borrow it — ” 

“You’d have to give it back.” 

“Well, naturally I’d give it 
back,” Marv said indignantly. “I 
wouldn’t keep anything that was 
legally stolen.” 



“It’s in the house with the rest 
of the Loot.” 

Marv thanked him and hurried 
after it. 

Tom began ' to stroll through 
the village. He reached the 
Mayor’s house. The Mayor was 
standing outside, staring at the 
sky. 

“Tom, did you take my bronze 
plaque?” he asked. 

“I certainly did,” Tom said 
belligerently. 

“Oh. Just wondering.” The 
Mayor pointed upward. “See it?” 
Tom looked. “What?” 

“Black dot near the rim of the 
small sun.” 

“Yes. What is it?” 

“I’ll bet it’s the Inspector’s 
ship. How’s your work coming?” 
“Fine,” Tom said, a trifle un- 
comfortably. 

“Got your Murder planned?” 
“I’ve been having a little trou- 
ble with that,” Tom confessed. 
“To tell the truth, I haven’t made 
any progress on it at all.” 

“Come on in, Tom. I want to 
talk to you.” 

TNSIDE the cool, shuttered liv- 
-*■ ing room, the Mayor poured 
two glasses of glava and motioned 
Tom to a chair. 

“Our time is running short,” 
the Mayor said gloomily. “The 
Inspector may land any hour 
now. And my hands are full.” He 
motioned at the Interstellar Ra- 



SKULKING PERMIT 



21 




dio. “ That has been talking 
again. Something about a revolt 
on Deng IV and all loyal Earth 
colonies are to prepare for con- 
scription, whatever that is. I 
never even heard of Deng IV, but 
I have to start worrying about it, 
in addition to everything else.” 

He fixed Tom with a stern 
stare. “Criminals on Earth com- 
mit dozens of Murders a day and 
never even think about it. All 
your village wants of you is one 
little Killing. Is that too much to 
ask?” 

Tom spread his hands nerv- 
ously. “Do you really think it’s 
necessary?” 

“You know it is,” the Mayor 
said. “If we’re going Earthly, we 
have to go all the way. This is 
the only thing holding us back. 
All the other projects are right 
on schedule.” 

Billy Painter entered, wearing 
a new official-blue shirt with 
bright metal buttons. He sank 
into a chair. 

“Kill anyone yet, Tom?” 

The Mayor said, “He wants to 
know if it’s necessary .” 

“Of course it is,” the Police 
Chief said. “Read any of the 
books. You’re not much of a 
Criminal if you don’t Commit a 
Murder.” 

“Who’ll it be, Tom?” the . 
Mayor asked. 

Tom squirmed uncomfortably 
in his chair. He rubbed his fin- 



gers together nervously. 

“Well?” 

“Oh, I’ll kill Jeff Hern,” Tom 
blurted. 

Billy Painter leaned forward 
quickly. “Why?” he asked. 
“Why? Why not?" 

“What’s your Motive?” 

“I thought you just wanted a 
Murder,” Tom retorted. “Who 
said anything about Motive?” 
“We can’t have a fake Mur- 
der,” the Police Chief explained. 
“It has to be done right. And that 
means you have to have a proper 
Motive.” 

Tom thought for a moment. 
“Well, I don’t know Jeff well. Is 
that a good enough motive?” 

The Mayor shook his head. 
“No, Tom, that won’t do. Better 
pick someone else.” 

“Let’s see,” Tom said. “How 
about George Waterman?” 
“What’s the Motive?” Billy 
asked immediately. 

“Oh . um . Well, I don’t 
like the way George walks. Never 
did. And he’s noisy sometimes.” 
The Mayor nodded approv- 
ingly. “Sounds good to me. What 
do you say, Billy?” 

“How am I supposed to de- 
duce a Motive like that?” Billy 
asked angrily. “No, that might be 
good enough for a Crime of Pas- 
sion. But you’re a legal Criminal, 
Tom. By definition, you’re Cold- 
blooded, Ruthless and Cunning. 
You can’t Kill someone just be- 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




cause you don’t like the way he 
walks. That’s silly." 

“I’d better think this whole 
thing over,” Tom said, standing 
up. 

“Don’t take too long,” the 
Mayor told him. “The sooner it’s 
done, the better.” 

Tom nodded and started out 
the door. 

“Oh, Tom!” Billy called. “Don’t 
forget to leave Clues. They’re 
very important.” 

“All right,” Tom said, and left. 

O UTSIDE, most of the vil- 
lagers were watching the sky. 
The black dot had grown im- 
mensely larger. • It covered most 
of the smaller sun. 

Tom went to his Place of Low 
Repute to think things out. Ed 
Beer had apparently changed his 
mind about the desirability of 
Criminal elements. The Tavern 
was redecorated. There was a 
large sign, reading: CRIMI- 

NAL’S LAIR. Inside, there were 
new, carefully soiled curtains on 
the windows, blocking the day- 
light and making the Tavern 
truly a Dismal Retreat. Weapons, 
hastily carved out of soft wood, 
hung on one wall. On another 
wall was a large red splotch, 
an ominous-looking thing, even 
though Tom knew it was only 
Billy Painter’s rootberry red 
paint. 

“Come right in, Tom,” Ed Beer 



said, and led him to the darkest 
corner in the room. Tom noticed 
that the Tavern was unusually 
filled for the time of day. People 
seemed to like the idea of being 
in a genuine Criminal’s Lair. 

Tom sipped a perricola and 
began to think. 

He had to Commit a Murder. 

He took out his Skulking Per- 
mit and looked it over. Unpleas- 
ant, unpalatable, something he 
wouldn’t normally do, ,but he did 
have the legal obligation. 

Tom drank his perricola and 
concentrated on Murder. He told 
himself he was going to kill some- 
one. He had to snuff out a life. 
He would make someone cease 
to exist. 

But the phrases didn’t contain 
the essence of the act. They 
were just words. To clarify his 
thoughts, he took big, red-headed 
Marv Carpenter as an example. 
Today, Marv was working on the 
Schoolhouse with his borrowed 
saw. If Tom killed Marv — well, 
Marv wouldn’t work any more. 

Tom shook his head impatient- 
ly. He still wasn’t grasping it. 

All right, here was Marv 
Carpenter, biggest and, many 
thought, the pleasantest of the 
Carpenter boys. He’d be planing 
down a piece of wood, grasping 
the plane firmly in his large frec- 
kled hands, squinting down the 
line he had drawn. Thirsty, 
undoubtedly, and with a small 



SKULKING PERMIT 



23 




pain in his left shoulder that 
Jan Druggist was unsuccessfully 
treating. 

That was Marv Carpente^. 

Then— 

Marv Carpenter sprawled on 
the ground, his eyes glaring open, 
limbs stiff, mouth twisted, no air 
going in or out his nostrils, no 
beat to his heart. Never again to 
hold a piece of wood in his large, 
freckled hands. Never again to 
feel the small and really unim- 
portant pain in his shoulder that 
Jan Druggist was — 

For just a moment, Tom 
glimpsed what Murder really 
was. The vision passed, but 
enough of a memory remained 
to make him feel sick. 

He could live with the Thiev- 
ing. But Murder, even in the best 
interests of the village . 

What would people think, after 
they saw what he had just imag- 
ined? How could he live with 
them? How could he live with 
himself afterward? 

And yet he had to kill. Every- 
body in the village had a job and 
that was his. 

But whom could he Murder? 

T HE excitement started later 
in the day when the Inter- 
stellar Radio was filled with 
angry voices. 

“Call that a colony? Where’s 
the capital?” 

“This is it,” the Mayor replied. 



“Where’s your landing field?” 
“I think it’s being used as a 
pasture,” the Mayor said. “I 
could look up where it was. No 
ship has landed here in over — ” 
“The main ship will stay aloft 
then. Assemble your officials. I 
am coming down immediately.” 
The entire village gathered 
around an open field that the In- 
spector designated. Tom strapped 
on his weapons and Skulked be- 
hind a tree, watching. 

A small ship detached itself 
from the big one and dropped 
swiftly down. It plummeted to- 
ward the field while the villagers 
held their breaths, certain it 
would crash. At the last moment, 
jets flared, scorching the grass, 
and the ship settled gently to the 
ground. 

The Mayor edged forward, fol- 
lowed by Billy Painter. A door 
in the ship opened, and four men 
marched out. They held shining 
metallic instruments that Tom 
knew were weapons. After them 
came a large, red-faced man 
dressed in black, wearing four 
bright medals. He was followed 
by a little man with a wrinkled 
face, also dressed in black. Four 
more uniformed men followed 
him. 

“Welcome to New Delaware,” 
the Mayor said. 

“Thank you, General,” the big 
man said, shaking the Mayor’s 
hand firmly. “I am Inspector 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Delumaine. This is Mr. Grent, 
my Political Adviser.” 

Grent nodded to the Mayor, 
ignoring his outstretched hand. 
He was looking at the villagers 
with an expression of mild dis- 
gust. 

“We will survey the village,” 
the Inspector said, glancing at 
Grent out of the comer of his 
eye. Grent nodded. The .uni- 
formed guards closed around 
them. 

Tom followed at a safe dis- 
tance, Skulking in true Criminal 
fashion. In the village, he hid 
behind a house to watch the 
Inspection. 

The Mayor pointed out, with 
pardonable pride, the Jail, the 
Post Office, the Church and the 
Little Red Schoolhouse. The In- 
spector seemed bewildered. Mr. 
Grent smiled unpleasantly and 
rubbed his jaw. 

“As I thought,” he told the 
Inspector. “A waste of time, fuel 
and a battle cruiser. This place 
has nothing of value.” 

“I’m not so sure,” the Inspector 
said. He turned to the Mayor. 
“But what did you build them 
for, General?” 

“Why, to be Earthly,” the 
Mayor said. “We’re doing our 
best, as you can see.” 

1%/TR. GRENT whispered some- 
thing in the Inspector’s ear. 

“Tell me,” the Inspector asked 



the Mayor, “how many young 
men are there in the village?” 

“I beg your pardon?” The 
Mayor said in polite bewilder- 
ment. 

“Young men between the ages 
of fifteen and sixty,” Mr. Grent 
explained. 

“You see, General, Imperial 
Mother Earth is engaged in a 
war. The colonists on Deng IV 
and some other colonies have 
turned against their birthright. 
They are revolting against the 
absolute authority of Mother 
Earth.” 

“I’m sorry to hear that,” the 
Mayor said sympathetically. 

“We need men for the Space 
Fleet,” the Inspector told him. 
“Good healthy fighting men. Our 
reserves are depleted — ”, 

“We wish,” Mr. Grent broke in 
smoothly, “to give all loyal Earth 
colonists a chance to fight for Im- 
perial Mother Earth. We are sure 
you won’t refuse.” 

“Oh, no,” the Mayor said. 
“Certainly not. I’m sure our 
young men will be glad — I mean 
they don’t know much about it, 
but they’re all bright boys. They 
can learn, I guess.” 

“You see?” the Inspector said 
to Mr. Grent. “Sixty, seventy, 
perhaps a hundred recruits. Not 
such a waste after all.” 

Mr. Grent still looked dubious. 
The Inspector and his Adviser 
went to the Mayor’s house for 



26

refreshment. Four soldiers ac- 
companied them. The other four 
walked around the village, help- 
ing themselves to anything they 
found. 

Tom hid in the woods nearby 
to think things over. In the early 
evening, Mrs. Ed Beer came fur- 
tively out of the village. She was 
a gaunt, grayish-blonde middle- 
aged woman, but she moved 
quite rapidly in spite of her case 
of housemaid’s knee. She had a 
basket with her, covered with a 
red checkered napkin. 

“Here’s your dinner,” she said, 
as soon as she found Tom. 

“Why . thanks,” said Tom, 
taken by surprise, “You didn’t 
have to do that.” 

“I certainly did. Our Tavern 
is your Place of Low Repute, 
isn’t it? We’re responsible for 
your well-being. And the Mayor 
sent you a message.” 

Tom looked up, his mouth full 
of food. “What is it?” 

“He said to hurry up with the 
Murder. He’s been stalling the 
Inspector and that nasty little 
Grent man. But they’re going to 
ask him. He’s sure of it.” 

Tom nodded. 

“When are you going to do it?” 
Mrs. Beer asked, cocking her 
head to one side. 

“I mustn’t tell you,” Tom said. 
“Of course you must. I’m a 
Criminal’s Accomplice.” Mrs. 
Beer leaned closer. 



“That’s true,” Tom admitted 
thoughtfully. “Well, I’m going to 
do it tonight. After dark. Tell 
Billy Painter I’ll leave all the 
fingerprints I can, and any other 
clues I think of.” 

“All right, Tom,” Mrs. Beer 
said. “Good luck.” 

r¥lOM waited for dark, mean- 
while watching the village. He 
noticed that most of the soldiers 
had been drinking. They swag- 
gered around as though the vil- 
lagers didn’t exist. One of them 
fired his weapon into the air, 
frightening all the small, furry 
grass-eaters for miles around. 

The Inspector and Mr. Grent 
were still in the Mayor’s house. 

Night came. Tom slipped into 
the village and stationed himself 
in an alley between two houses. 
He drew his knife and waited. 

Someone was approaching! He 
tried to remember his Criminal 
Methods, but nothing came. He 
knew he would just have to do 
the Murder as best he could, and 
fast. 

The person came up, his figure 
indistinct in the darkness. 

“Why, hello, Tom.” It was the 
Mayor. He looked at the knife. 
“What are you doing?” 

“You said there had to be a 
Murder, so—” 

“I didn’t mean me,” the Mayor 
said, backing away. “It can’t be 
me.” 



SKULKING PERMIT

“Why not?” Tom asked. 

“Well, for one thing, somebody 
has to talk to the Inspector. He’s 
waiting for me. Someone has to 
show him — ” 

“Billy Painter can do that,” 
said Tom. He grasped the Mayor 
by the shirt front, raised the knife 
and aimed for the throat. “No- 
thing personal, of course,” he 
added. 

“Wait!” the Mayor cried. “If 
there’s nothing personal, then 
you have no Motive!” 

Tom lowered the knife, but 
kept his grasp on the Mayor’s 
shirt. “I guess I can think of.one. 
I’ve been pretty sore about you 
appointing me Criminal.” 

“It was the Mayor who ap- 
pointed you, wasn’t it?” 

“Well, sure — ” 

The Mayor pulled Tom out of 
the shadows, into the bright star- 
light. “Look!” 

Tom gaped. The Mayor was 
dressed in long, sharply creased 
pants and a tunic resplendent 
with medals. On each shoulder 
was a double row of ten stars. His 
hat was thickly crusted with gold 
braid in the shape of comets. 

“You see, Tom? I’m not the 
Mayor any more. I’m a General!" . 

“What’s that got to do with it? 
You’re the same person, aren’t 
you?” 

“Not officially. You missed the 
ceremony this afternoon. The 
Inspector said that since I was 



officially a General, I had to wear 
a General’s uniform. It was a 
very friendly ceremony. All the 
Earthmen were grinning and 
winking at me and each other.” 

R AISING the knife again, Tom 
held it as he would to gut a 
fish. “Congratulations,” he said 
sincerely, “but you were the 
Mayor when you appointed me 
Criminal, so my Motive still 
holds.” 

“But you wouldn’t be Killing 
the Mayor! You’d be Killing a 
General! And that’s not Murder!” 
“It isn’t?” Tom asked. “What 
is . it then?” 

“Why, Killing a General is 
Mutiny!” 

“Oh.” Tom put down the knife. 
He released the Mayor. “Sorry.” 
“Quite all right,” the Mayor 
said. “Natural error. I’ve read up 
on it and you haven’t, of course 
— no need to.” He took a deep 
breath. “I’d better get back. The 
Inspector wants a list of the men 
he can Draft.” 

Tom called out, “Are you sure 
this Murder is necessary?” 

“Yes, absolutely,” the Mayor 
said, hurrying away. “Just not 
me.” 

Tom put the knife back in his 
belt. 

Not me, not me. Everyone 
would feel that way. Yet some- 
body had to be Murdered. Who? 
He couldn’t Kill himself. That 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




would be Suicide, which wouldn’t 
count. 

He began to shiver, trying not 
to think of the glimpse he’d had 
of the reality of Murder. The job 
had to be done. 

Someone else was coming! 

The person came nearer. Tom 
hunched down, his muscles tight- 
ening for the leap. 

It was Mrs. Miller, returning 
home with a bag of vegetables. 

Tom told himself that it didn’t 
matter whether it was Mrs. Miller 
or anybody else. But he couldn’t 
help remembering those conver- 
sations with his mother. They left 
him without a Motive for Killing 
Mrs. Miller. 

She passed by without seeing 
him. 

He waited for half an hour. 
Another person walked through 
the dark alley between the 
houses. Tom recognized him as 
Max Weaver. 

Tom had always liked him. 
But that didn’t mean there 
couldn’t be a Motive. All he 
could come up with, though, was 
that Max had a wife and five 
children who loved him and 
would miss him. Tom didn’t want 
Billy Painter to tell him that that 
was no Motive. He drew deeper 
into the shadow and le.t Max go 
safely by. 

The three Carpenter boys came 
along. Tom had painfully been 
through that already. He let them 



pass. Then Roger Waterman 
approached. 

He had no real Motive for 
Killing Roger, but he had never 
been especially friendly with him. 
Besides, Roger had no children 
and his wife wasn’t fond of him. 
Would that be enough for Billy 
Painter to work on? 

He knew it wouldn’t be . and 
the same was true of all the vil- 
lagers. He had grown up with 
these people, shared food and 
work and fun and grief with them. 
How could he possibly have a 
Motive for Killing any of them? 

But he had to Commit a Mur- 
der. His Skulking Permit required 
it. He couldn’t let the village 
down. But neither could he Kill 
the people he had known all his 
life. 

Wait, he told himself in sudden 
excitement. He could Kill the In- 
spector! 

1%/JOTIVE? Why, it would be an 
even more Heinous Crime 
than Murdering the Mayor — ex- 
cept that the Mayor was a Gen- 
eral now, of course, and that 
would only be Mutiny. But even 
if the Mayor were still Mayor, 
the Inspector would be a far more 
important Victim. Tom would be 
Killing for Glory, for Fame, for 
Notoriety. And the Murder would 
show Earth how Earthly the col- 
ony really was. They would say, 
“Crime is so bad on New Dela- 



SKULKING PERMIT 



29 




ware that it’s hardly safe to land 
there. A Criminal actually Killed 
our Inspector on the very first 
day! Worst Criminal we’ve come 
across in all space.” 

It would be the most spectacu- 
lar Crime he could Commit, Tom 
realized, just the sort of thing a 
Master Criminal would do. 

Feeling proud of himself for the 
first time in a long while, Tom 
hurried out of the alley and over 
to the Mayor’s house. He could 
hear conversation going on in- 
side. 

“. sufficiently passive popu- 
lation,” Mr. Grent was saying. 
“Sheeplike, in fact.” 

“Makes it rather boring,” the 
Inspector answered. “For the 
soldiers especially.” 

“Well, what do you expect from 
backward agrarians? At least 
we’re getting some recruits out of 
it.” Mr. Grent yawned audibly. 
“On your feet, guards. We’re go- 
ing back to the ship.” 

Guards! Tom had forgotten 
about them. He looked doubtfully 
at his knife. Even if he sprang at 
the Inspector, the guards would 
probably stop him before the 
Murder could be Committed. 
They must have been trained for 
just that sort of thing. 

But if he had one of their own 
weapons . 

He heard the shuffling of feet 
inside. Tom hurried back into the 
village. 



Near the market, he saw a 
soldier sitting on a doorstep, sing- 
ing drunkenly to himself. Two 
empty bottles lay at his feet and 
his weapon was slung sloppily 
over his shoulder. 

Tom crept up, drew his black- 
jack and took aim. 

The soldier must have glimpsed 
his shadow. He leaped to his feet, 
ducking the stroke of the black- 
jack. In the same motion, he 
jabbed with his slung rifle, catch- 
ing Tom in the ribs, tore the rifle 
from his shoulder and aimed. 
Tom closed his eyes and lashed 
out with both feet. 

He caught the soldier on the 
knee, knocking him over. Before 
he could get up, Tom swung the 
blackjack. 

Tom felt the soldier’s pulse — 
no sense Killing the wrong man — 
and found it satisfactory. He took 
the weapon, checked to make 
sure he knew which button to 
push, and hastened after the In- 
spector. 

TTALFWAY to the ship, he 
caught up with them. The 
Inspector and Grent were walking 
ahead, the soldiers straggling be- 
hind. 

Tom moved into the under- 
brush. He trotted silently along 
until he was opposite Grent and 
the Inspector. He took aim and 
his finger tightened on the trig- 
ger .. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

He didn’t want to Kill Grent, 
though. He was supposed to Com- 
mit only one Murder. 

He ran on, past the Inspector’s 
party, and came out on the road 
in front of them. His weapon 
was poised as the party reached 
him. 

“What’s this?” the Inspector 
demanded. 

“Stand still,” Tom said. “The 
rest of you drop your weapons 
and move out of the way.” 

The soldiers moved like men in 
shock. One by one they dropped 
their weapons and retreated to 
the underbrush. Grent held his 
ground. 

“What are you doing, boy?” 
he asked. 

“I’m the town Criminal,” Tom 
stated proudly. “I’m going to Kill 
the Inspector. Please move out of 
the way.” 

Grent stared at him. “Criminal? 
So that’s what the Mayor was 
prattling about.” 

“I know we haven’t had any 
Murder in two hundred years,” 
Tom explained, “but I’m chang- 
ing that right now. Move out of 
the way!” 

Grent leaped out of the line of 
fire. The Inspector stood alone, 
swaying slightly. 

Tom took aim, trying to think 
about the spectacular nature of 
his Crime and its social value. 
But he saw the Inspector on the 
ground, eyes glaring open, limbs 



stiff, mouth twisted, no air going 
in or out the nostrils, no beat to 
the heart. 

He tried to force his finger to 
close on the trigger. His mind 
could talk all it wished about the 
desirability of Crime; his hand 
knew better. 

“I can’t!” Tom shouted. 

He threw down the gun and 
sprinted into the underbrush. 

^TTHE Inspector wanted to send 
a search party out for Tom 
and hang him on the spot. Mr. 
Grent didn’t agree. New Dela- 
ware was all forest. Ten thousand 
men couldn’t have caught a fugi- 
tive in the forest, if he didn’t 
want to be caught. 

The Mayor and several villag- 
ers came out, to find out about 
the commotion. The soldiers 
formed a hollow square around 
the Inspector and Mr. Grent. 
They stood with weapons ready, 
their faces set and serious. 

And the Mayor explained 
everything. The village’s un- 
civilized lack of Crime. The job 
that Tom had been given. How 
ashamed they were that he had 
been unable to handle it. 

“Why did you give the assign- 
ment to that particular man?” 
Mr. Grent asked. 

“Well,” the Mayor said, “I fig- 
ured if anyone could Kill, Tom 
could. He’s a Fisher, you knoto. 
Pretty gory work.” 



SKULKING PERMIT 



31 




“Then the rest of you would be 
equally unable to kill?” 

“We wouldn’t even get as far as 
Tom did,” the Mayor admitted 
sadly. 

Mr. Grent and the Inspector 
looked at each other, then at the 
soldiers. The soldiers were staring 
at the villagers with wonder and 
respect. They started to whisper 
among themselves. 

“Attention!” the Inspector bel- 
lowed. He turned to Grent and 
said in a low voice, “We’d better 
get away from here. Men in our 
armies who can’t kill . .” 

“The morale,” Mr. Grent said. 
He shuddered. “The possibility of 
infection. One man in a key posi- 
tion endangering a ship — perhaps 
a fleet — because he can’t fire a 
weapon. It isn’t worth the risk.” 
They ordered the soldiers back 
to the ship. The soldiers seemed 
to march more slowly than usual, 
and they looked back at the vil- 
lage. They whispered together, 
even though the Inspector was 
bellowing orders. 

The small ship took off in a 
flurry of jets. Soon it was swal- 
lowed in the large ship. And then 
the large ship was gone. 

The edge of the enormous 
watery red sun was just above 
the horizon. 

“VT'OU can come out now,” the 
Mayor called. Tom emerged 
from the underbrush, where he 



had been hiding, watching every- 
thing. 

“I bungled it,” he said miser- 
ably. 

“Don’t feel bad about it,” Billy 
Painter told him. “It was an im- 
possible job.” 

“I’m afraid it was,” the Mayor 
said, as they walked back to the 
village. “I thought that just pos- 
sibly you could swing it. But you 
can’t be blamed. There’s not an- 
other man in the village who 
could have done the job even as 
well.” 

“What’ll we do with these 
buildings?” Billy Painter asked, 
motioning at the Jail, the Post 
Office, the Church, and the Little 
Red Schoolhouse. 

The Mayor thought deeply for 
a moment. “I know,” he said. 
“We’ll build a playground for the 
kids. Swings and slides and sand- 
boxes and things.” 

“ Another playground?” Tom 
asked. 

“Sure. Why not?” 

There was no reason, of course, 
why not. 

“I won’t be needing this any 
more, I guess,” Tom said, hand- 
ing the Skulking Permit to the 
Mayor. 

“No, I guess not,” said the 
Mayor. They watched him sor- 
rowfully as he tore it up. “Well, 
we did our best. It just wasn’t 
good enough.” 

“I had the chance,” Tom mut- 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tered, “and then I let you all 
down.” 

Billy Painter put a comforting 
hand on his shoulder. “It’s not 
your fault, Tom. It’s not the fault 
of any of us. It’s just what comes 
of not being civilized for two hun- 
dred years. Look how long it took 
Earth to get civilized. Thousands 
of years. And we were trying to 
do it in two weeks.” 

“Well, we’ll just have to go 
back to being uncivilized,” the 
Mayor said with a hollow at- 
tempt at cheerfulness. 

Tom yawned, waved, went 
home to catch up on lost sleep. 
Before entering, he glanced at the 
sky. 

Thick, swollen clouds had 
gathered overhead and every one 
of them had a black lining. The 
fall rains were almost here. Soon 
he could start fishing again. 

Now why couldn’t he have 
thought of the Inspector as a fish? 
He was too tired to examine that 
as a Motive. In any case, it was 
too late. Earth was gone from 
them and civilization had fled 
for no one knew how many cen- 
turies more. 

He slept very badly.

Play Back 

By j. t. McIntosh 



There was never tomorrow, only 
yesterday — and to Bert Siddon, 
it was the ideal arrangement! 



Illustrated by KRIGSTEIN 



T HINGS were very quiet. 
Bert Siddon was leaning on 
his arms on one side of the 
bar while the most regular of his 
regular customers kept the other 
side from falling down. The or- 
ders were given to Bert, but 
executed by Bill, his less-than- 
monosyllabic assistant. 

It was Monday night, and 
Monday in the Golden Swan gen- 
erally turned out to be discussion 
night. Someone unidentified had 
poked his head in, said disgust- 
edly, “For Pete’s sake, the 
Brains,” and disappeared again. 



It was usual on Monday nights 
for the paradoxes, stupidities and 
injustices of the world to be dis- 
covered between seven and eight- 
thirty p.m. and set right before 
nine-thirty to the satisfaction of 
everybody except Harry Smith, 
who was never satisfied, and the 
Professor, to whom nothing was 
as simple as that and very little 
was simple at all. 

“The wife would never believe 
we was talking about science and 
things,” said Jim Moir, marvel- 
ing at it himself. “She thinks that 
whenever men get together and 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




talk, it’s always sex or sports.” 
“Don’t mention women,” said 
Harry Smith gloomily. “They’re 
enough to drive you to drink.” He 
raised his glass. 

“I’ve |iven up women,” Alec 
Harper announced. “I’m getting 
old. No more whisky and women 
for me. I’m going to spend my 
money on chocolate from now on 
and enjoy myself.” 

Bert continued to lean on his 
arms and beam happily at the 
company. Bill continued to do all 
the work behind the bar, silently 
for the most part, but with an oc- 
casional caustic grunt to show he 
didn’t believe a word of any of it. 

“We know what you think 
about women, Bert,” said Moir 
enviously. “If my wife looked 
like Marilyn Monroe, maybe / 
would — ” 

“It’s not just looks,” said Bert 
contentedly. “My wife’s an angel.” 
“You’re lucky,” Smith grunted. 
“Mine’s still living.” 

H ARPER’S bellowing laugh 
rattled the bottles behind 
Bert. 

“You won’t believe what I’m 
going to tell you,” Bert re- 
marked. 

“Don’t suppose we will,” said 
Harper agreeably, “but let’s hear 
you just the same.” 

“If I could have my pick of 
all the women in the world,” said 
Bert, “I’d still choose Martha.” 



Considering the emphasis he 
put on it, his pronouncement fell 
rather flat. But then, they didn’t 
realize that he could have his pick 
of all the women in the world, 
in a way. That he could have 
anything he wanted. That what 
he had was all he did want. 

This time, anyway. 

Maybe the next time he 
would — 

“My round,” said Smith. “No 
whisky for you, Alec?” 

“Well . .” said Harper, and 
everybody laughed. 

It was established by argument 
and experiment that a pint glass 
full of beer could hold twenty- 
three pennies without spilling a 
drop. This advanced exercise in 
science and mathematics natur- 
ally led to bigger things. It was 
quite independent of Bert that 
the subject of time travel was 
reached. 

Bert didn’t mind. He couldn’t 
tell his friends about his gift (he 
had done that once, with very 
nearly disastrous results), but he 
didn’t mind hearing what they 
had to say about time travel. 

“Blooming nonsense,” said 
Smith. “It just ain’t possible and 
that’s all there is to it. Stands 
to reason.” 

“Nothing’s impossible,” argued 
Moir — firmly, for him. “Noth- 
ing’s ever impossible.” 

“Time travel is,” said Smith 
flatly.

35 




“Just as well,” Harper said, “or 
the government would take it 
over and lose money on it.” He 
bellowed with laughter again. 
Harper was a man who appre- 
ciated his own jokes. 

“Where’s the Professor?” he 
went on cheerfully. “Oh, there 
he is. He’s such a little fellow 
that when he takes his glasses 
off, you can scarcely see him at 
all. Professor, does it stand to 
reason that time travel’s impos- 
sible? Or is nothing ever impos- 
sible?” 

They looked at the Professor, 
who was not, of course, a pro- 
fessor except when he was in the 
Golden Swan. 

“The possibility or impossibil- 
ity of very few things actually 
stands to reason,” he said diffi- 
dently. “There are very few things 
of which one can confidently and 
conscientiously say, ‘It’s impos- 
sible and will always be impos- 
sible.’ ” 

But on the whole he thought 
time travel was more or less, to 
a great extent, and by and large, 
one of these things. Though he 
might be wrong, of course. 

Bert Siddon continued leaning 
on his arms and listening. 

npHEY considered the paradox 
of Beethoven writing the 
Moonlight Sonata and someone 
else taking it back a few weeks 
in time and playing it to him 



before he had written it. Who 
composed it? In Time Two, cer- 
tainly not Beethoven, for he had 
heard it played to him as a new 
piece of music, something he had 
never heard before. Having heard 
it, he might write it down, but 
he could no longer compose it. 

They discussed the question of 
a man going back in time and 
seeking himself out. Could there 
be two of him at the same time, 
or only one? Would he be able to 
meet and talk to himself, or 
would one of him automatically 
cease to exist when the other came 
into existence in the same time? 
Bill grunted disgustedly. 

“Look at this,” said Smith 
derisively. “Just look at it and 
tell me if it doesn’t prove the 
whole idea of time travel is plain 
damned nonsense. If time travel 
was possible, wouldn’t someone 
in the future have found out how 
to do it? And wouldn’t he have 
gone back to test it? Well, have 
you ever seen a time traveler?” 
“Hold on,” Harper objected. 
“How do you know I’m not from 
the twenty-third century? I’m not 
going to tell you I’m a time 
traveler, am I? I’d be thrown in 
an asylum or something. Well, 
the hell with it, I’ll take the 
risk. I’m from the twenty-third 
century, Harry.” 

Smith sniffed. 

“You don’t believe me? Maybe 
you wouldn’t believe the real time

traveler, either. And if you didn’t 
believe him when he told you, 
how the devil could you believe 
him when he didn’t?” 

Bert smiled, because he was the 
only man who knew anything 
about it. The only man in the 
world. 

He often leaned on his arms 
and smiled, whatever the conver- 
sation was about. If it was about 
football, he might happen to re- 
member who was going to beat 
whom 2-1 on Saturday, and he’d 
certainly remember the winners 
for the season. If it was about 
baseball, he’d know the pennant 
and series results. 

And though he never set him- 
self up as a prophet, it was fair 
enough to say casually, “Well, 
I’m not a betting man, but you 
watch Marbulla in the Derby,” 
or, “No, the Administration looks 
pretty safe to go back, but I 
think . .” 

He didn’t like to go further 
than that, knowing Marbulla was 
going to win the Derby and the 
opposition the next national elec- 
tion . having seen them do it, 
in fact. 

It was in much the same way 
that, in this discussion, he said 
at last judicially, “You all seem 
to be taking it for granted that 
if time travel could be done, you’d 
need a machine to do it. In all 
the stories, it’s always a time ma- 
chine of some kind — ” 



“Naturally it’s a machine,” said 
Smith. “What else could it be?” 
“A human being is a time ma- 
chine,” the Professor pointed out 
mildly. “He travels forward regu- 
larly through time. So is a build- 
ing, a book, a photograph record. 
Anything. Everything.” 

S MITH brushed that aside. 

“Talk sense. If you’re going 
to do any funny work with time — 
not that I’m saying you can — if 
you’re going to do any moving 
around in time, except just move 
forward at the usual speed, how 
are you going to do it except 
with a machine?” 

“You can move about the floor 
without a machine, can’t you?” 
asked Bert. “You don’t need a 
helicopter to get across to the 
dart board, do you?” 

“You think people can walk 
through time?” Smith sarcastic- 
ally wanted to know. 

“Why not? You can’t do it with 
a machine, can you? Well, why 
say that if it can ever be done, 
it must be /lone with a machine?” 
“That’s a good argument,” 
agreed the Professor. “A very 
good argument. But how would 
you — how could it be done, if it 
could be done, Mr. Siddon? Have 
you any ideas on that?” 

“If I knew that,” said Bert, en- 
joying this, “I’d be doing it, I 
suppose. But how’s this for an 
idea? Think about ten minutes

ago. If you can go back ten 
minutes, you can travel in time, 
can’t you? Well, concentrate on 
ten minutes ago. Jim Moir was 
talking, Harry was just finishing 
a pint, a car turned outside and 
its lights flashed in those mirrors 
there. Some of us can remember 
better than others. Some of us 
can only remember roughly what 
happened. Some of us can almost 
hear Jim talking and see the 
lights flashing.” 

Everybody tried to hear Jim 
talking and see the lights flash- 
ing. 

“Well, granted that some of us 
do it better than others,” Bert 
went on, “what if somebody could 
do it perfectly? Maybe he’d find 
Jim really was talking, the lights 
really were flashing — and it was 
actually ten minutes ago.” 

“Say that again,” said Jim 
Moir. 

Bert obliged. Of course, it 
would be more than just remem- 
bering. It would be — it was — 
something only one man could do. 
Otherwise, every time the clock 
was set back, everybody would 
know it had been set back. 

As it was, only one man knew. 
Only one man benefited. Only one 
knew what had happened. 

Only one man walked through 
time. 

But Bert didn’t tell them that, 
naturally. 

“If you can remember what 



happened well enough,” he sug- 
gested, “maybe you can make it 
happen again. And if it works for 
ten minutes, why shouldn’t it 
work for twenty years?” 

Bert wasn’t annoyed when a 
chorus of ridicule broke out, for 
Bert knew. It was like going back 
a few years, telling people about 
the atom bomb and jet planes and 
listening to them “proving” they 
were impossible. He’d done that, 
too. 

P RESENTLY, however, the 
Brains became interested in 
the thing, possible or not, and 
discussed what it would be like, 
independent of its improbability. 
The idea appealed particularly to 
Harper and the Professor. 

“You’d only be able to go back 
over your own life,” Smith re- 
marked. 

“Yes, you’d only be able to go 
back to the first thing you re- 
membered, and to times you re- 
membered well,” said Bert. “But 
after all, you could only do this 
if you had a better memory than 
anybody has, so that wouldn’t 
worry you.” 

“ You’ve got a pretty good 
memory, Bert,” Moir observed. 
“Better than anyone else I know. 
You can always — ” 

“You’d put everything else 
back each time,” the Professor 
mused. “Think of having a sec- 
ond chance at everything!”

The others also saw the pos- 
sibilities. 

“You could make a lot of 
money.” 

“Money? A fortune!” 

“Money’s only the start. You 
could do anything, if you knew 
what everybody else was going to 
do.” 

“You could rule the Earth!” 

“No, you couldn’t, because 
you’d still be ordinary.” 

“Ordinary? With all the money 
-you’d have from the horses, the 
pools, the stock exchange? You’d 
be the richest man in the world 
— and how could the richest man 
in the world be ordinary?” 

It was Bert who brought the 
discussion down to the level of 
sense and sobriety. 

“If it were me,” he said con- 
tentedly, “I don’t think I’d want 
anything more than I’ve got.” 

“Maybe not,” said Moir, jeal- 
ous again. “It’s all right for you 
to say that.” 

Bert knew what he meant. “I’d 
have to live quite a few extra 
lives before I found a girl like 
Martha.” 

“But you found her the first 
time.” 

“Yes,” Bert agreed blandly. 

“You’d always be able to do 
things better than anybody else,” 
said Harper. “Like darts.” 

He took the three darts and 
demonstrated humorously. He 
wasn’t the best darts player pres- 



ent, by any means. Nevertheless, 
with the first dart he scored a 
perfect treble twenty. 

“We’ll count that,” he declared, 
laughed and tried again. Treble 
one. 

He took back the dart, poised 
once more and said — “Time 
switch!” Single twenty. He tried 
again — “Time switch !” — and 
eventually, in eleven tries, scored 
three treble twenties. 

“There you are,” he said tri- 
umphantly. “Three darts — three 
treble twenties.” 

“That’s the only way you could 
ever win,” Smith grunted. 

“That’s how it would work,” 
Bert nodded. “It would be the 
same with most games. Suppose 
I was playing Bobby Locke . .” 

T HERE was a chorus of deri- 
sive laughter. They all knew 
Bert’s golf. 

“Still, I must admit he’s im- 
proving,” said Harper, like a man 
determined to be fair. “Last time 
I was out with him, he started 
with 12, 10, 11 at the first three 
holes — but then he tightened up 
after that.” 

“Suppose I was playing Bobby 
Locke,” persisted Bert with un- 
impaired good humor. “It might 
take three tries before I got a 
decent drive — ” 

“It might?” Harper asked, with 
a shout of laughter. 

“And I’d know I’d needed 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




three tries, but Bobby Locke 
wouldn’t. Then, for the second, I 
wouldn’t try anything spectacular 
— just onto the green.” 

There was another howl of 
laughter, in which Bert joined. 

“That might take about half a 
dozen shots,” he admitted, “but 
it would still only count two. 
And I’d hole out the next time 
for a three. Even Bobby Locke 
couldn’t stand up to that sort 
of competition for long.” 

“Of course,” said the Professor 
thoughtfully, “people might be a 
bit surprised at the end that you 
were so tired.” 

“Tired?” 

“Yes. You’d have played two 
or three hundred shots, though 
only fifty or sixty would count.” 
“No, I’d only have played fifty 
or sixty,” Bert declared. “See 
what would happen. I’d make a 
bad shot, then go back and do 
it again. I wouldn’t have to go 
for the ball. I’d be going back 
to before the shot was made — so 
even if I needed five thousand 
shots, I’d only have played fifty.” 
“But if that’s so,” argued the 
Professor, “they’d all be the 
same.” 

“No more than any two shots 
you take one after the other are 
the same. I’d know what I’d 
done the last time and I’d make 
any correction that was needed.” 
Some of them were a little lost, 
but most could see the idea, and 



they all had a great time imagin- 
ing how they could do what 
they’d always wanted to do. 

Even Harry Smith, the cynic, 
the pessimist, the unbeliever, 
joined in. “You could go back 
and live your life from twenty 
again.” 

“Why twenty?” the Professor 
objected. “Why not five and 
check on your whole education?” 

“Why not zero and make sure 
you were born right?” asked 
Harper. 

“Women, too,” said Moir. “You 
could keep trying with a girl 
until you found the right tech- 
nique. You’d know all about her 
and she wouldn’t know a thing 
about you. You could . .” 

This line of discussion natur- 
ally kept them all interested for 
a long time. 

“And then,” Bert remarked, “if 
you met a girl too late — well, you 
could always go back and meet 
her before it was too late, couldn’t 
you?” 

H E straightened up, taking the 
weight off his arms for the 
first time since the discussion 
started. Martha had been men- 
tioned several times — and he 
could never forget that nothing 
he could do could prevent her 
dying in five years. True, when 
that happened, he could put 
everything right back to when 
she was eighteen .

But in spite of that, the thought 
that she would die at twenty- 
nine — that she would always die 
at twenty-nine — made him anxi- 
ous to see her, to reassure him- 
self. He hadn’t seen her for two 
hours. 

“Can you manage, Bill?” he 
asked. 

No one saw anything funny in 
that, though Bill could probably 
do the entire work of the bar 
just as well in Bert’s absence as 
he had been doing it in his pres- 
ence. They were used to Bert. 

So Bert went to make sure 
Martha was all right, to kiss her 
on the back of the neck, to call 
her by the names that only he 
and she knew, to reassure her 
and be reassured. 

“Didn’t think Bert had the 
brains to think out things like 
that,” Smith observed. “Plain 
nonsense, of course. But all the 
same . .” 

“Granting the possibility of 
walking through time like that,” 
said the Professor, “all the rest 
we’ve been talking about follows. 
You could have all the money 
you wanted, and beat anybody at 
any game, and at least give your- 
self the opportunity to rule the 
world, and all the rest of it. But 
there’s another thing nobody’s 
mentioned.” 

“What’s that, Professor?” ask- 
ed Harper. 

“Time would stick. If anyone 



had this gift — well, he wouldn’t 
live forever, but he wouldn’t want 
to die, either. So he’d keep put- 
ting time back, over and over- 
again. Every time he was in dan- 
ger of dying, he’d snap time back. 
Time, henceforth, would be con- 
fined to the few years of this 
man’s life.” 

“God, yes!” exclaimed Harper. 
“Never thought of that. But sure- 
ly, sooner or later, he’d be in an 
accident and wouldn’t be able 
to—” 

“If he was careful, he could 
always have the fraction of a 
second he needed to snap time 
back a little. You see, he’d only 
have to put it far enough back 
for him to avoid the accident, and 
it might never happen that he 
didn’t get the instant of time he 
needed. He could go on and on 
and on, and for the rest of us, 
it wouldn’t be worthwhile plan- 
ning the future — because there 
wouldn’t be any future.” 

rpHE Professor and Harper were 
the only two in the company 
who really saw that point of view. 
At any rate, they were the only 
two who were really interested 
in it. And they took it in very 
different ways. 

Harper laughed boisterously at 
the idea of the closed circuit in 
time, a few years repeating and 
repeating themselves ad infini- 
tum. It was a cosmic joke. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The Professor frowned, dis- 
turbed, anxious and worried at 
the very idea of such a circuit, 
stopping all progress, all develop- 
ment, cutting off the future, mak- 
ing everything futile and insig- 
nificant merely because one man, 
by a chance in untold billions, 
could walk in time ... a man 
who, like all human beings, want- 
ed to live forever. 

They looked at each other, 
Harper laughing at the gargan- 



tuan joke of a universe stuck in a 
temporal closed circuit because 
of one man with a mighty gift, 
and the Professor stunned at the 
vast futility of it. 

However, it was only an idea. 

When Bert came back content- 
edly, having seen Martha and 
satisfied himself that she was all 
right and that she still loved him, 
the Brains were discussing Flying 
Saucers.

Forecast 

Next month, you're getting two high-voltage novelets . and probably 
a third, though it's a little hard to tell in advance; depends on how well 
the editorial shoehorn works. 

THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD by Frederik Pohl does a thorough and 
startling job of disproving the traditional test to see if you are dreaming. 
Pinching just doesn't work. Surgical instruments are much better . but a 
mechanic's kit is best of all! 

In Theodore Sturgeon's WHEN YOU'RE SMILING, there is a— no, the 
story can't be described except in terms of its own uncompromising realism 
and remarkable theme. You've never read science fiction like this before. 
It's a shock wave of terror— with a jolting, blinding conclusion. It's Sturgeon! 
If you think you can outguess him, just try. You may, if you're really shrewd, 
get all the facts . but you won't have the truth until it strikes like an 
unexpected slap that will leave handmarks on your mind for years to come. 

Naturally, there will be a handsome batch of short stories, Willy Ley's

similar to Fig. 2 of a device from 
the time of Christ. This device is 
taken to be a primitive “gal- 
vanic” battery, surprising as that 
may seem. As a matter of fact, 
it couldn’t be anything else 
known to Man! 

My correspondent stated that 
he knew, of course, that the 
ancient Greeks were acquainted 
with some of the phenomena of 
static electricity, but that he had 
never heard anything about an- 
cient batteries. He added that he 
thinks he should have heard 
about it, since he earned for him- 
self a degree in Electrical En- 
gineering. And he closed his letter 
with the question of how it was 



possible that such knowledge 
could become a “lost art.” 

That my correspondent had 
never heard about this is not at 
all surprising to me. This histor- 
ical item is not yet recorded in 
the introductory sections of text- 
books on electrical engineering. 
The reason is that the small 
amount of existing literature is 
rather scattered and the basic 
reports are of foreign origin. Con- 
sequently, it might be useful to 
write a reasonably comprehensive 
report on the Mesopotamian bat- 
teries of twenty centuries ago.

helm Konig and appeared in the 
weekly magazine section of the 
daily newspaper of the German 
heavy industries, the Deutsche 
Bergwerks-Zeitung, under the 
date of January 16, 1938. Konig 



was attached to the Iraq Museum 
in Baghdad, although he is not, 
by training, a scientist. 

Soon after the date just men- 
tioned, the climate of Iraq in 
general and of Baghdad in par- 
ticular got too much for Mr. 
Konig and he went home to Ger- 
many, where he used his spare 
time to write a book under the 
title Im verlorenen Paradies — 
Neun Jahre Irak, or, in transla- 
tion: In the ( area of) the Lost 
Paradise — Nine Years in Iraq. It 
was published in Berlin in 1940 
and copies of it can be found in 
American libraries. 

In this book, he told the story 
of the discovery of the ancient 
battery which in itself sounds a 
little like fiction. Baghdad is at

the Tigris river and, in 1936, the 
Tigris produced a major flood. 
The low-lying portions of Bagh- 
dad were covered by a few inches 
of water for a long time and these 
large and shallow puddles were 
extremely welcome to female 
mosquitoes as a place for de- 
positing their eggs. Draining the 
puddles was apparently impos- 
sible and it was decided to fill 
them in. However, there are no 
hills in the immediate vicinity of 
Baghdad and the material needed 
had to be taken from a small 
hill a few miles to the southeast 
of the city. That hill bore the 
local name of Khujut Rabu’a and 
happened to be conveniently lo- 
cated at the railroad track which 
leads from Baghdad to Khanaqin. 

As the workmen started load- 
ing their carts with sand and dirt 
from the hill, they came across 
ruins. Both the Iraq Museum and 
the government stepped in and 
their experts were unanimous in 
declaring that these were the rem- 
nants of a settlement from the 
time of the Parthian kingdom, 
which existed from 250 B.c. to 224 

A.D. 

I don’t know what happened 
to the mosquito-breeding puddles 
in the poorer sections of Baghdad. 
They were probably left to evap- 
orate. The digging at Khujut 
Rabu’a, however, turned into 
scientific excavations. 

Among the artifacts found was 



a vase or urn of whitish -yellow 
burned clay of a well-known type, 
differing from the standard mu- 
seum piece in that its neck had 
been knocked off a long time ago. 
In view of this handicap, the vase 
was shorter than usual, measur- 
ing 14 centimeters or 5.5 inches in 
height. Its largest diameter was 8 
centimeters or about 3 Vs inch. 
The hole at the top measured 3.3 
centimeters or slightly over 1 l A 
inch in diameter. There were 
traces of asphaltum all around 
the hole. 

TNSIDE the vase, the investiga- 
^ tors found a Cylinder of sheet 
copper, 26 millimeters (almost 
precisely one inch) in diameter 
and 9.8 centimeters (3% inch) 
tall. 

The cylinder had been formed 
by bending a piece of flat sheet 
copper around a dowel of some 
kind and soldering the ends to- 
gether. The bottom of the cylin- 
der was closed by a disc of sheet 
copper without soldering, the 
metal having been crimped to 
prevent the disc from falling 
through. 

At the upper end, the copper 
cylinder was closed by a thick 
plug of asphaltum which, in its 
center, held a rod of iron, about 
three inches in overall length and 
sticking out on top about y&th of 
an inch (10 millimeters). 

The iron rod was strongly oxi-

dized and tapered to a point at 
the time it was found. Quite pos- 
sibly it was longer originally and 
it might have rested on the bot- 
tom of the copper cylinder, but 
without touching the metal, be- 
cause there was a thin (3 milli- 
meter) layer of asphaltum on top 
of the copper disc. 

It was perhaps well that Wil- 
helm Konig was not a profes- 
sional archeologist, for he looked 
at the find with open eyes and 
decided that this, records or not, 
could have been an electric ele- 
ment and nothing else. * 

He had the various components 
analyzed. The copper turned out 



to be rather pure with only traces 
of zinc, lead and iron. (The 
report on the analysis was pub- 
lished in Forschungen und Fort- 
schritte, 1938, No. 1.) 

He then inquired of archeolo- 
gists whether anything like this 
had been mentioned in records; 
the answer was negative. 

The next inquiry was whether 
anything like it had been found 
earlier. Yes, at a somewhat earlier 
date, four similar vases had been 
found near Tel’ Omar, the ancient 
Seleucia-on-the-Tigris, some 25 
miles downriver from Baghdad, 
lying opposite Ctesiphon on the 
other bank. The Tel’ Omar speci- 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




mens lacked the iron cores and 
the copper cylinders were closed 
at both ends and were found, on 
opening, to be full of plant fibers. 
Their discoverer, at a loss what 
to think about it, had tentatively 
concluded that the plant fibers 
had originally been writing ma- 
terial which had fallen apart after 
twenty centuries of drying. Next 
to the urns, one thin, almost wire- 
like bronze rod and three wirelike 
iron rods were found. 

What gave the whole a special 
flavor was that these urns were 
not found in a grave, as the ex- 
cavating archeologists more or 
less expected, but were lying 
among the ruins of a house that 
was well away from the other set- 
tlements. Moreover, they were as- 
sociated with bowls that the 
experts proclaimed to have been 
magic paraphernalia. Obviously 
the separate building had been 
the warlock’s house, where 
strange things went on. 

¥>Y the end of 1938, nothing of 
all this had been published 
in any language other than Ger- 
man and, since nobody had writ- 
ten up even the bare facts in 
English, I did so in the form of 
two short reports. One was pub- 
lished in this country in Astound- 
ing, the other in England in 
Discovery, both, by coincidence, 
in the March issues of 1939. Prof. 
Gamow’s remarks in his own 



book must be based on one of 
these two pieces, which were both 
written and published before 
Konig’s own book appeared in 
1940, and which lack much detail 
I did not know until I read the 
book. 

Wilhelm Konig, as has been 
mentioned, queried archeologists 
about similar finds. When he went 
home to Germany, he was shown 
an unexhibited find in a museum 
in Berlin. It had been made in 
the ruins of Ctesiphon and dated 
from a somewhat more recent 
period, the Sassanian kingdom 
which lasted from 224-651 a.d. 
The find consisted of three fairly 
large clay vessels. One of them 
contained ten copper cylinders, 
the second had ten iron rods and 
the third held ten asphaltum 
plugs with holes in the centers. 

Ten elements ready for as- 
sembly, lacking only the clay 
urns which evidently could be 
bought from any potter in town. 

One thing Konig apparently 
did not do was to find out how 
well a reconstruction of such a 
battery would work. This was 
done in this country as a direct 
result 'of my first article. Mr. 
Willard F. M. Gray, an elec- 
trical engineer at the General 
Electric plant in Pittsfield, Mass- 
achusetts, wrote to me to obtain 
all the information available for 
the purpose of building a replica 
of the ancient battery. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

The dimensions had been given 
by Konig and the composition of 
the metals, established analytic- 
ally, was reasonably close to that 
of commercial sheet copper and 
iron rods of today, so there were 
no special difficulties as far as 
materials were concerned. The 
only unknown factor was the na- 
ture of the liquid electrolyte used 
by the “magicians” of the Par- 
thian and Sassanian kingdoms. 
This simply was not known, but 
the choice was somewhat nar- 
rowed down to substances that 
could have been in use then. 

Mr. Gray decided on a solution 
of copper sulphate as a likely 
electrolyte. He reported that this 
“worked quite well for a short 
time.” The reconstructed battery 
is now on exhibit at the Berk- 
shire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass. 

Nobody who knows all the 
facts doubts that they did have 
“galvanic” batteries in Baghdad 
at about the time of Christ and 
for a few centuries thereafter. 
But when it comes to the question 
of what was done with them, we 
still have to resort to conjecture. 
Such a battery is rather weak 
and even if the “magicians” 
learned the trick of using several 
of them in conjunction, the out- 
put of current is small. Of course 
you can “taste” it and this might 
have played a role in what might 
be called magical experiments. 
Maybe it was even used for an 



assumed curative value, since 
somebody might have had the 
idea that the “taste” was similar 
to medicinal herbs. 

A S for actual work, about the 
only thing you can do with 
such a weak current is the electro- 
plating of small objects. Wilhelm 
Konig pointed out that some of 
the metal bowls from that time 
show what look like traces of 
plating. Moreover, he discovered 
that the silversmiths of Baghdad 
still used a primitive method of 
gold-plating (Fig. 4) earlier in 
this century. They did not know 
when this method had been in- 
troduced. They merely knew that 
it was “old” which, unfortunate- 
ly, can mean anything that goes 
back prior to the birth of the 
speaker. 

That these silversmiths used a 
primitive gold-plating method 
very much their own had prob- 
ably been noticed by earlier trav- 
elers, but the obvious conclusion 
had been that they had imitated 
an early type of western device, 
lending it a local flavor by using 
home-made materials. 

Konig rather suspects that their 
device goes back in an uninter- 
rupted though devious line to the 
batteries of old Baghdad. This 
suspicion also answers Mr. Pace’s 
question of how such knowledge 
could ever become a “lost art.” 
It didn’t. It merely failed to do 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the one thing we expect any use- 
ful device and invention to do — 
it did not spread. 

That trade secrets stay con- 
fined to places or, sometimes, 
families and groups of families is 
not novel. The batteries of Bagh- 
dad merely represent an extreme 
case. 

But there are two things we 
still would like to have to con- 
sider the case definitely proved. 
One would be a two-thousand- 
year-old artifact which has been 
both electro-plated and well- 
preserved. The other would be a 
remark in some manuscript that 
the artisans or magicians of 
Baghdad could change bronze to 
silver and silver to gold. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Looking back through the 1953 
calendar, I noticed something that 
bothers me. On the 23 rd of De- 
cember (as a “ for instance /’ it 
seems to go this way all through 
the year), the Sun rose at 6:59 
and set at 4.59. The next day, it 
rose at the same time, but set at 
5:00 p.m. Can you explain why 
one time stays the same while 
the other jumps? 

Thom Perry 
4040 Calvert St. 
Lincoln 6, Nebraska 

This is something that has 
once been called by an astron- 
omer “The increase of the day 



during the afternoon only” and 
which has puzzled many people. 
The real reason is that the orbit 
of the Earth around the Sun is 
not a circle but an ellipse. 

If it were a circle, this ap- 
parent discrepancy would not 
take place. Since it is an ellipse, 
the Earth moves somewhat fast- 
N/ er along its orbital path when 
the northern hemisphere has 
winter because, at that season, 
the Earth is closest to the Sun. 
(The seasons are due not to the 
distance from the Sun but to 
the tilt of the Earth's axis and, 
of course, its equator.) 

The time needed for the daily 
rotation of the Earth stays the 
same, but because the Earth 
moves a longer distance during 
this time interval, the move- 
ment of the Sun across the sky 
seems to be different. 

If we adhered to the defini- 
tion of “noon” as the instant 
the Sun is highest in the sky, we 
would be forced to have days of 
somewhat different length for 
the different seasons. A sun dial 
will indicate such “proper 
noons,” but you cannot run in- 
dustry on sun dials. Hence, if 
you compare the sun dial to 
“standard time,” which makes 
the interval from midnight to 
midnight the same all year 
round, your sun dial will be 
“fast” some of the time and 
“slow” some of the time. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



51 




To be specific, the sun dial 
will be “fast” from April 16 to 
June 15 (as much as four min- 
utes in the middle of May) and 
“slow” from June 15 to Sep- 
tember 2nd with a maximum of 
a little more than six minutes 
on July 27). From September 
2nd until December 26, the 
sun dial will be “fast” (over 
1.6 minutes on November 4) 
and “slow” from then on until 
April 16, the slowest day being 
February 12th, with some 14 
minutes. 

All of this simply means that 
the “noon” of standard time 
coincides with the noon of the 
sun dial only four times per 
year— on April 16, June 15, 
September 2nd and December 
26. At all other times, the sun 
dial noon differs from standard 
noon and, during the first 
months of a year, the increase 
of daylight time is all added 
after the artificial standard 
noon. On a sun dial, equal time 
would be added before and 
after “noon,” but, as has been 
said, you cannot run industry 
by sun dials. 

In an old travel book, I found 
a statement about penguins living 
somewhere near Newfoundland. 
It cannot be a simple mistake, 
such as observation from a dis- 
tance, because it is mentioned 
that the sailors collected the pen- 



guin eggs tor food. I thought 
penguins lived only in the ant- 
arctic regions. Were there some 
in Newfoundland a few hundred 
years ago? 

Karl F. Seifert 

Emerson, Wise. 

Both you and the author of 
the old book you read are cor- 
rect; it is a case of transfer of 
names. The bird now called 
“penguin” is restricted to the 
area of Antarctica with one 
species which, having once been 
subject to extreme wanderlust, 
settled on the Galapagos Islands 
directly under the equator. 

The “penguins” of the New- 
foundland area were not pen- 
guins in our sense. They were 
auks — specifically, the Great 
Auk (scientific name: Alca im - 
pennis), which attained the size 
of penguins, had wings too 
small to be useful for flight and 
bore a general resemblance to 
penguins in coloration. 

The Great Auk originally in- 
habited the North European 
shores along the North Sea, Ice- 
land, the southern tip of Green- 
land and the eastern shore of 
the North American continent 
from Labrador to about the 
coast of Virginia, with single 
specimens and small .groups 
occurring as far south as north- 
ern Florida. It is now complete- 
ly extinct, having lasted longest 
on a few small rocky islands off 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Cape Reykjanes, south of Ice- 
land. 

It was this Great Auk that 
was the original hearer of the 
name of “penguin,” derived 
from “pen-gwyn”, meaning 
“white head”. The name re- 
ferred to two blinding white 
spots on an otherwise nearly 
black head. 

At the time this name was in 
use, the southern hemisphere 
penguins were still unknown. 
Sailors who were acquainted 
with the northern “pen-gwyn” 
simply transferred the name, 
much in the manner in which 
English settlers in North 
America began to call a North 
American thrush a “robin” be- 
cause of the similar coloration 
of the feathers on its chest, 
even though the two birds are 
neither related nor even of the 
same size. 

The great French naturalist, 
Count Buffon, was very much 
disturbed by such careless no- 
menclature and suggested that 
the southern penguins he called 
“manchots”. But only a few- 
learned men followed this sug- 
gestion and not for long. 

However, the confusion is 
minor, not only because the 
Great Auk is now extinct, hut 
because the two birds lived in 
different hemispheres. The 
Great Auk never got close to 
the Tropic of Cancer and the 



penguin — excepting the Gala- 
pagos variety — never reached 
the Tropic of Capricorn. 

Could an explosion ( like we've 
already had ) cause the Earth to 
deviate from its course? If so, 
will the deviation be toward or 
away from the Sun and how soon 
could it be detected? Would it 
need months or years? 

James A. Velazquez 
Far Rockaway, N. Y. 

Theoretically, any explosion 
will influence the course of the 
Earth to a small extent. The 
direction in which this influ- 
ence is exerted would depend 
on the time of the day. In the 
movement of the Earth around 
the Sun, the front side is the 
“dawn side”. Hence an explo- 
sion at dawn would retard the 
Earth slightly, while an explo- 
sion at dusk would accelerate it. 

If the Earth were accelerated 
by an explosion at dusk, it 
would drift “outward” in the 
Solar System and take up a new 
orbit slightly farther away from 
the Sun. If decelerated by an 
explosion at dawn, the Earth 
would drift “inward” and take 
up a new orbit somewhat closer 
to the Sun. 

But because of the enormous 
mass of the Earth, all this is 
just theoretical. Even if all the 
explosion of two World Wars 
and all atomic tests took place

simultaneously, the result might 
very well be too small to be 
detected. Most likely it would 
amount to far less than the 
“perturbations” suffered by the 
Earth as a result of the gravi- 
tational pull of its two neigh- 
bors in the Solar System, Mars 
and Venus. 

We are told that all motion will 
cease at absolute zero. Would the 
electrons around an atomic nuc- 
leus continue to revolve around 
it? 

John F. Schenck 

Rt. 1 

Mexico, N. Y. 

The statement that all mo- 
tion will cease at absolute zero 
is meant to apply to molecular 
motion only. Nothing is said 
about the motion of sub-atomic 
particles. 

I can understand to a certain 
extent how energy can be re- 
leased in a fission bomb such as 
the A-Bomb, but how is it re- 
leased in a fusion bomb? Please 
explain. 

William E. West 

Box 520 

Madison, So. Dakota 

In one respect, the two types 
of bombs* may be said to be 
alike — in both cases, some mat- 
ter is destroyed to appear as 
energy. 

In the fission bomb, the 



heavy atoms of either uranium- 
235 or of plutonium are made 
to fall apart. They break up 
into two heavy atoms of rough- 
ly equal mass plus a number of 
smaller “splinters”. The impor- 
tant point is that the total mass 
of the “splinters” of all sizes 
does not quite add up to the 
mass of the original atoms. The 
“missing mass” has been turn- 
ed into energy. 

In the fusion bomb, light 
atoms of individual masses 
smaller than “4” are made to 
reassemble into helium atoms. 
Again the resulting helium 
atoms do not quite have the 
mass of the atoms from which 
they were formed, the “sur- 
plus” being released as energy. 

This question may not really 
belong in Galaxy, but I wonder 
whether there is any truth in the 
legend of the vampires of Ro- 
mania. If so, is there any connec- 
tion between that legend and the 
vampire bats? 

Estelle Taylor 

P.O. Box 

Graymoor Village, N. Y. 

The answer, offhand, would 
be “no,” but there is a minor 
mystery, or perhaps just an in- 
teresting coincidence, connect- 
ed with the vampire legend. 

As far as one can tell, the 
vampire legend of various coun- 
tries on the Balkan peninsula is 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




quite old, though nobody has 
been able to pinpoint its age, 
for unfortunately the carbon-14 
method cannot he applied to 
legends. When it came to the 
shape of the vampire, folklore 
imagined something like a large 
hat. This folklore impression 
was strong enough to force its 
way into scientific zoology. 

When Central and South 
America became known, it was 
also learned that there were 
hlood-sucking bats in the New 
World. A few enormous hats 
which had been caught and 
preserved were at once suspect- 
ed to be the culprits (simply 
because of their size) and were 
catalogued as Vampyrus Spec- 
trum. 

Later, it turned out that 
this hat was a completely harm- 
less fruit-eater and that the 
actual hlood-sucking vampire 
was a small and insignificant 
bat which received the scientific 
name of Desmodus rujus. This 
was in about 1840. 

When it became known 
among European zoologists 
that a blood-sucking hat was a 
reality, they naturally jumped 
to the conclusion that the le- 
gendary bat-sliaped vampire of 
the Balkans was based on such 
a fact. 

But to this day, nobody has 
turned up a southeast Euro- 
pean bat with blood-sucking 



habits. No known species is 
even under suspicion. 

The present version of the 
vampire legend, much used in 
fantasy, where the vampire has 
human shape and is “undead,” 
seems to be fairly recent. 

As you know, the vampire is 
supposed to be immortal and 
only subject to the compound 
accident of suspicious peasants, 
zealous country priests and 
sharpened stakes. On the other 
hand, everybody who dies be- 
cause of a vampire is supposed 
to turn into one himself. 

Now if you start the chain 
with just one vampire, you may 
assume that, during the first 
year of its activity, one victim 
dies. By the end of the year, 
you have two vampires. If they 
each make one haul per year, 
the vampire population doubles 
every year. At the end of the 
tenth year, you’ll have 1,000 
full-fledged vampires — under 
the assumption that two dozen 
of them succumbed to attrition 
by stakes. After 15 years, you’ll 
have 32,000; after 20 years, 
over one million. 

After half a century, every- 
body would be a vampire! 

Having thus pulled a prop 
out from under a whole cate- 
gory of stories, I close this last 
column of the year with sinister 
glee.

Unde Tom's Planet 



By FINN O'DONNEVAN 



Illustrated by BARTH 



All up and down the whole 
galactic plantation, there 
were no old folks at home— 
until the Aingoes came along! 

O NE must remember that, 
in its sixty years of po- 
litical existence, the Ga- 
lactic Council has succeeded 
almost completely in destroying 
the institution of slavery. This 
accomplishment becomes even 
more remarkable when one con- 
siders that the anti-slavery laws 
had to be made acceptable to the 
differing mores of eight hundred 
and two independent governments 
of the Confederation. 



Because of this practical ne- 
cessity, the Slavery Act was 
based not on birth equality, but 
on the more expedient doctrine 
of relative inferiority. Thus, the 
inferiority of an enslaved race, 
relative to its enslaver, must be 
proven. The Council has always 
found grounds, even in the most 
backward of races, tor a grant of 
independence. 

Indeed, there is only a single 
instance where all the Council’s 
work has been in vain. This case, 
naturally, is an exceptional one. 
The Council unofficially approves 
of this particular enslavement! 

Morally, this would seem in- 
defensible; but a Galactic Coun- 
cil must take the long view. And 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




when one considers the unusual 
benefits accruing from this par- 
ticular enslavement . 

Aspects of Confederation, 
de M ant set 

T HE men aboard Council Cut- 
ter 8432 thought their radar 
was having hallucinations. Forty- 
two pips! It was impossible. Even 
Bill Sims, the Council agent, 
didn’t believe it when he ordered 
the pips intercepted. 

But there was no doubt, once 
the speedy little cutter came into 
range. There were forty-two Del- 
gen ships, spaced in regular or- 
der, running at close to top 
speed. 

Sims stared at them thought- 
fully. He was young and tall and 
his coloring marked him unmis- 
takably as a native Earthman. 
This patrolling assignment was 
his first. He didn’t want to make 
any mistakes. 

Especially, he didn’t want to 
make any mistakes with Delgens. 

He told the radioman to relay 
full information to Council Head- 
quarters, just in case. A fleet in 
space could be up to no good. 
Then he contacted the flagship of 
the fleet. 

“This is Council Cutter 8432,” 
he said. “I request permission to 
board you for a routine inspec- 
tion.” 

“Certainly you can board us,” 
the answer came promptly. “In- 



spect as much as you like, as long 
as we can maintain course.” 

That seemed reasonable — at 
the time — for a fleet burned a lot 
of fuel. 

“Request granted,” Sims said. 
“Please show a light at your tn- 
try port.” He hesitated, then add- 
ed, “The Galactic Council has 
been informed of this fleet move- 
ment.” 

“We were about to notify them 
ourselves. And this isn’t a fleet. 
It’s a rescue mission.” 

Sims exchanged a look with 
his radioman. Delgens weren’t 
known as rescuers. Just the op- 
posite, in fact. 

During the first great expan- 
sion wave from Earth, a small, 
tough core of colonists had push- 
ed forward until they found an 
ideal planet. The planet was 
Delge, in the extreme northeast 
quadrant of the Galaxy. And 
Delge was worth waiting for. 

The Earthmen — now Delgens 
— thrived on the planet’s perfect 
climate, its disease-free atmos- 
phere, and grew .rich on its fruit- 
ful soil. Adaptation and change 
came with startling speed, once 
Earth was left behind. But Delge 
was far off the mainstream and 
isolation can breed bad habits. 
Although the Delgens were physi- 
cally splendid, they left some- 
thing to be desired in the matter 
of ethics. 

Delge, in common with a num- 



UNCLE TOM'S PLANET 



57 




ber of other places, found that 
machinery was singularly un- 
yielding in its demands. Curse a 
machine and it ignores you. Re- 
fuse it shelter and it rusts. Feed 
it too little lubrication and it 
burns out. Run it too fast and 
it founders. Starve it for fuel 
and it quits. 

But slaves! Slaves can be work- 
ed under conditions that no ma- 
chine would tolerate. Slaves eat 
what there is, sleep where they 
can. When one dies, the task- 
master doesn’t suffer the deep 
monetary sadness he feels upon 
the demise of an expensive ma- 
chine — for slaves beget more 
slaves, which is more than can be 
said of machinery. 

Twice in ten years, Delge had 
violated the Slavery Act. Sims 
was thinking of this as he entered 
the Delgen flagship. 

A PAIR of big guards led him 
to the Captain’s quarters. 
The ship, with its massive con- 
struction and oversize appoint- 
ments, made him feel puny and 
out of place. Captain Olche in- 
tensified this feeling. Olche was a 
normal enough Delgen, but his 
ruddy seven-foot bulk and his 
air of genial superiority made 
Sims feel insignificant and, ac- 
cordingly, resentful. The Captain 
didn’t appear to notice. 

“I suppose you’re interested in 
the cargo holds?” he asked. 



“If you please.” 

“Of course.” The Captain es- 
corted Sims down a long corridor 
and opened a door. 

Sims stepped in — and caught 
his breath. 

The hold was packed with 
small and despondent-looking 
grayish-green creatures. 

“Did you ever see a sorrier 
bunch?” the Captain asked, as 
though discussing an inferior 
herd of cattle. “They call them- 
selves Aingoes.” 

At first, Sims thought they 
were stunted descendants of 
Earth. He quickly saw that he 
was mistaken. The Aingoes were 
non-humans, about four feet tall, 
skinny, with round alien heads 
and tiny, narrow bodies. They sat 
on the floor of the hold in com- 
plete and abnormal silence, as 
though all spirit had been drained 
out of them. 

“Every ship is filled with the 
things,” Captain Olche said. “I 
think we managed to remove 
every one of them from their 
scrubby little planet.” 

“For what purpose?” Sims ask- 
ed. 

The Captain raised both eye- 
brows. “Why, slavery, of course,” 
he stated, as though it were the 
most natural thing in the Uni- 
verse. 

Sims looked at the Captain 
with amazement. Sims was new 
in the Council service. Like most 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




agents, he had had personal ex- 
perience with slavers. As a boy, 
he had seen Anderson’s Apes 
working on Earth farms. The po- 
lite fiction was maintained that 
these mute, soft-eyed inhabitants 
of Anderson’s Planet were merely 
clever beasts. But the Council 
scientists proved their rationality 
and eventually they were eman- 
cipated. Sims had known it all 
along, had played with the young 
ones — until they were punished 
for playing with him — and the 
ruling came too late to mitigate 
his hatred of their owners. 

Sims had always thought that 
slavers were debased and furtive 
people, well aware of the wrong 
they were doing, but too greedy 
to stop. This Delgen, though, had 
a perfectly genuine conviction 
that slavery was the natural, in- 
evitable condition for a whole 
species! 

S IMS found this attitude dis- 
concerting. He took a form out 
of his pocket and began to fill in 
the pertinent data. 

The Captain watched for a 
while, then said, “We aren’t 
breaking any law, so what’s the 
point of acting as if we are?” 
“You’re violating the Slavery 
Act,” Sims said with flat-voiced 
violence, forcing his hand, which 
wanted to make a fist, to write 
steadily and clearly. 

The Captain shook his head. 

UNCLE TOM'S PLANET 



“Slavery is regulated by the rel- 
ative-inferiority ruling. Examine 
these creatures more closely. 
You’ll see right off that they’re 
about as inferior as anything can 
get and stay alive. Sure, we 
know we’ll have to get a court 
decision, but it’s only a formality 
in this case.” 

Sims wanted to retort, but he 
made himself continue writing his 
report. Legally, slavery was pos- 
sible; actually, nobody had ever 
been able to make inferiority 
stick. Tough, dedicated men, the 
Council agents stopped most at- 
tempts before they got started. 
Those that came to court were 
up against the equally dedicated 
thoroughness of Council scien- 
tists and the shrewd resourceful- 
ness of Council lawyers. 

Between them, the scientists 
and lawyers always won in court. 
They could prove every time that 
a tentacle was equal to a hand, 
disorganized functionality was 
every bit as good as a centralized 
nervous system, ten legs were 
more stable than two on rocky 
planets, rudimentary wings help- 
ed balance desert-runners, and a 
nose didn’t have to be used for 
smelling — or even exist in the 
case of anerobic life-forms. 

They could prove anything 
they had to prove. Not by trick- 
ery, but by proving that races in- 
tended for slavery were as well 
adapted to their environment as 



59 




the would-be slavers were to 
theirs. If the life-forms were re- 
pulsive in human terms, as they 
sometimes were, the lawyers 
could be counted on to build up 
sympathy for them. 

Knowing that no case had ever 
been lost, Sims relaxed and even 
let himself smile a little as he 
finished his report. The Delgens 
were- making a bold move, but it 
didn’t stand a chance. All prece- 
dent was against it, for there was 
no slavery in the entire Confed- 
eracy. 

And meanwhile, the Delgen 
fleet was moving at close to top 
speed toward the planet Moira II. 

Y OU imbecile!” Sims’ Chief 
roared, three days later, 
when Sims reported in. “You mo- 
ron! You complete and abysmal 
idiot! Didn’t you learn anything 
in training school?” 

Sims stood stiffly at attention. 
“I don’t understand, sir. What 
have I done wrong?” 

The Chief was an Earthman, 
like Sims, although from a differ- 
ent political subdivision of that 
venerable planet. Large, pale, 
fleshy, the Chief was famous for 
his relentless hatred of slavers. 

“I’ll tell you what you did 
wrong,” the Chief said. “You 
didn’t think. That can be fatal in 
the Service. You knew the Del- 
gens were going to make a court 
fight out of this?” 



“Yes, sir, and I reported — ” 

“You also knew, or should have 
known, how important it is for 
us to try our cases in friendly 
courts.” The Chief opened a 
chart of the Northeast sector. 
“You intersected them here. You 
should have ordered them to 
Danton IV, which was not only 
the nearest Confederacy planet, 
but it’s also strongly anti-slavery. 
Instead, you let them go into 
custody at Moira II.” 

“What’s wrong with that?” 
Sims asked. 

“Two years ago, we forcibly 
separated Moira II from their 
own little chattels, that’s what’s 
wrong.” 

“Oh,” Sims said. “Oh, Lord!” 

The Chief began to pace up 
and down the length of his small, 
cluttered office. “Not your fault. 
Someone at Headquarters should 
have told you. Well, it’s not ir- 
reparable. All we need is an air- 
tight case.” 

“That shouldn’t be difficult. 
There is no such thing as an in- 
ferior race.'* 

“They taught you that in 
school. Proving it is something 
else. All right, we might as well 
prepare a philosophical brief, to 
begin with.” 

He pressed two buttons on his 
desk. A stenographer hurried in, 
pad and pencil ready. She was 
followed by the interpreter, lead- 
ing an Aingo. 



UNCLE TOM'S PLANET 



61 




The Chief walked three com- 
plete circles around the sorry- 
looking little creature, frowning 
deeply. 

“Take it away,” he said to the 
interpreter. “What am I supposed 
to do with this? Take it away and 
bring me the biggest, fattest, hap- 
piest one you can find.” 

“This is the best of the bunch,” 
the interpreter said apologetical- 
ly. “That hangdog look is muscu- 
lar configuration, not emotional. 
And they all stoop like that. The 
snuffling seems to be a hereditary 
rather than — ” 

“All right,” the Chief cut in 
impatiently. “Let’s get on with it. 
Ask him how he feels about be- 
ing snatched off his planet.” 

rpHE interpreter questioned, 
they listened carefully to the 
Aingo’s answering squeal. “He 
says he feels very grateful, sir.” 
The Chief looked surprised. 
“No indignation, eh?” He turned 
to the stenographer. “Put down, 
‘Peaceful, cooperative attitude. A 
genuine sign of moral sufficiency.’ 
Now ask him why he’s grateful.” 
“He says he’s grateful because 
the Delgens made them stop 
fighting each other.” 

The Chief rubbed his bald 
head worriedly. “Do they fight 
often?” 

“All the time,” the interpreter 
replied sadly. 

The Chief said to the stenogra- 



pher, “Scratch that first out. 
Now write, ‘Bold, combative 
attitude, well suited to face in- 
dependently the problems of ev- 
eryday existence.” 

Sims cleared his throat. “Ask 
him if many are killed when they 
fight.” 

“No one is ever killed,” was the 
translation. “We don’t fight very 
well.” 

The Chief gave Sims a look of 
sheer bafflement. “Scratch it out,” 
he told the stenographer. “Ask 
the Aingo what it wants.” 

“Nothing,” was the answer. 

“Aha! Write, ‘Desire to be left 
in peace, to continue all-impor- 
tant spiritual growth.’ ” 

The Aingo squealed anxiously 
for several seconds. 

“But they don’t want to be 
left alone,” the interpreter said. 
“It seems they get very lonely 
and nervous.” 

“Do they want to be slaves?” 

The Aingo thought carefully 
before answering. 

“They don’t care,” the inter- 
preter said. 

The Chief said to the stenogra- 
pher, “Put down, ‘Passive re- 
sistance, an almost saintly spirit 
of gentle reproach against the 
overbearing Delgens, the culmi- 
nation of long years of — ” 

The Aingo squealed again. 

“He says they might like be- 
ing slaves,” the interpreter ex- 
plained. “He says the Delgens are 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




strong and masterful, and strong 
and masterful people should rule 
weak and inferior people.” 

“He said that, did he?” the 
Chief roared. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Get him out of here! Get him 
out before I brain him! These 
damned people want to be slaves. 
They deserve to be slaves. But 
they aren’t going to be slaves!” 
The stenographer asked, “Shall 
I type any of this?” 

“Throw it all out,” the Chief 
said. “Sims, get the specialists to 
work. This case comes up pretty 
sOon and we have to find some 
grounds for Aingo equality.” He 
turned to the interpreter, who was 
standing near the door. “Get that 
damned spiritless animal out of 
here! I don’t see what the Del- 
gens want them for!” 

The Aingo smiled as it was led 
out. It evidently enjoyed being 
shouted at. 

S IMS was given the job of or- 
ganizing the reports of the 
various specialists. Their findings 
were depressing. 

Physically, the Aingoes seemed 
to be an error of nature. They 
had poor eyesight and defective 
hearing, faulty coordination and 
inferior musculature. Almost any 
disease could floor them, and did. 
They matured rapidly — if their 
habitual state of imbecility could 
be called maturity — and died 



rapidly. They should have had a 
life span of twenty to thirty 
years. Instead, the average Aingo 
was fortunate if he lived five. 

Ecologically, the findings were 
all negative. On the one hand, the 
Aingoes seemed incapable of im- 
posing even the most rudimen- 
tary civilization on even the gen- 
tlest planet. On the other hand, 
they were unable to exist either 
independently, symbiotically or 
parasitically, in a natural state. 

Mentally, no test could be de- 
vised that would rate them above 
ingratiating imbecile. Their per- 
ceptions were slow. They had no 
true emotions except for a feeble 
antagonism toward their own 
kind. They had no ambition; that 
drive was replaced by a vague 
uneasiness and an evident desire 
to be taken care of. 

They had nothing resembling 
morals or morality. 

But Sims did discover what the 
Delgens wanted them for. 

It seemed that the Aingoes 
could climb trees and therefore 
pick fruit in the great orchards 
of Delge. 

“That’s everything,” Sims said, 
handing in the last of his reports. 

The Chief scanned it briefly 
and dropped it on his desk. 

“Is there anything we can 
use?” Sims asked. 

“Not a thing,” the Chief said. 
“We just don’t have a case.” 

“If I hadn’t let the Delgen fleet 



UNCLE TOM'S PLANET 



63 




go to the planet Moira — ” 

“It wouldn’t have made any 
difference. The law is still based 
on the relative-inferiority rulings. 
Any court, no matter how favor- 
ably disposed, would have to find 
against us.” 

But Sims couldn’t forgive him- 
self for the mistake he had made. 
Things might have been different 
on Danton IV. 

He went over the whole situa- 
tion again in his mind — the forty- 
two pips on the radar, the con- 
tact with the Delgen fleet, the talk 
with Captain Olche . 

“Wait a minute!” Sims burst 
out. “Isn’t there a law against re- 
moving an indigenous people 
from their planet for the purpose 
of exploitation?” 

“There is,” the Chief said. “But 
it’s easily circumvented. If the 
Delgens left a sizable percentage 
of Aingoes on the planet as I as- 
sume they did — ” 

“They claimed they didn’t!” 

“Hmm. Let’s see. The Delgens 
said that they rescued the Ain- 
goes. Their statement implies 
that conditions on the Aingo 
planet were too dangerous to sup- 
port life. If we can show other- 
wise, if we can prove unnatural 
interference — ” 

Sims stood up. “I’ll leave right 
now.” 

“The court sits tomorrow,” the 
Chief said. “I’ve asked for en- 
docrine readings. That should 



stall them for a few days.” 

“I’ll find something,” Sims 
promised. 

“You’d better,” the Chief told 
him. 

I N the Council Cutter, Sims ar- 
rived at LG 34232-2, the un- 
named planet of the Aingoes. He 
took photographs and readings 
of the Aingo sun and atmosphere 
readings of the planet. He radioed 
this data back to Headquarters, 
then swung low over the planet, 
searching for signs of habitation. 

The Aingo planet was smaller 
than Mars; it seemed to be al- 
most entirely ocean, bordered by 
jungle areas. He found no intel- 
ligent life. 

Sims conducted a painstaking 
search over the most temperate 
of the land masses. Still there was 
nothing to see except small, 
frightened animal and bird life. 

The Delgens had removed ev- 
ery one of the Aingoes. 

He landed the ship for a closer 
look at the planet. In the jungle, 
he found a profusion of animal 
and bird life and myriad insects. 
Nothing seemed particularly 
menacing. The vegetation was 
lush and varied; some of it, pre- 
sumably, was edible. 

He radioed the Chief. “This 
appears to be a completely liva- 
ble planet,” he reported. “A little 
hot and damp for comfort, but 
certainly not dangerous.” 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Have you found any signs of 
villages?” the Chief demanded. 
“I’m still looking.” 

“Good. You may come across 
something. We’ll need it, too. The 
court has ruled against any more 
physical evidence on the Aingoes. 
They say they’ve seen enough.” 
“Can you stall them any long- 
er?” 

“I couldn’t stall them at all. 
The case has been running for 
only two days, but it’s drawing to 
a close — against us. Still, the 
Council is hunting through all 
our data. They may pull some- 
thing out of the hat.” 

“I’ll let you know when I find 
something,” Sims said, and sign- 
ed off. 

He slept aboard his ship, and 
the next morning began a search 
of the temperate zone at treetop 
level. He found nothing. The 
next day he was out again. 

At noon, he spotted a little ir- 
regularity in the jungle, a patch 
less thick than the rest. He land- 
ed and went to it on foot. 

I T was jungle, like all the rest. 

But the growth was sparser, 
the trees smaller, greener, less 
massive. The patch had a certain 
regularity which was out of place 
in the irregular and asymetrical 
jungle. Looking it over, Sims felt 
sure that civilization had been re- 
sponsible for this growth, not na- 
ture. 



He walked to the center and- 
began to dig. 

Half a foot down, he found 
shards of pottery and a shattered 
gourd. These fragments appeared 
of very recent origin. 

Two feet down, he found a 
bronze fork. 

Five feet down, he found a 
piece of shiny blue plastic. He 
stared at it for a long time. 

Pottery, baked from clay, is a 
primitive skill. The production 
of bronze is not so simple. Tin 
and copper of some purity must 
be alloyed in the proper quanti- 
ties. Bronze marks the beginnings 
of the science of metallurgy. And 
plastics are even more complex. 
Before you can make a bit of 
shiny blue plastic, you must have 
a genuine technology. 

At some time in their history, 
the Aingoes had had this tech- 
nology! 

To judge by what he had 
found, they had retrogressed, 
sinking finally below the basic 
village stage. They had retreated 
from civilization. But perhaps 
the retreat had not been unaided. 

Someone like the Delgens, 
plowing the Aingo villagers un- 
der, assisting the rapid jungle to 
hide any evidence of former glo- 
ries or future promise. 

The standby on the radio blar- 
ed, and Sims hurried to answer 
it. 

“Sims,” the Chief said, “I want 



UNCLE TOM'S PLANET 



65 




you off that planet at once.” 

“I can’t leave yet,” Sims pro- 
tested. “I’ve found evidence of 
unnatural interference. It can’t 
be refuted. It’s absolutely — ” 

“I’m giving you a direct order. 
You are to leave immediately.” 

“But, Chief!” Sims cried. “The 
evidence — ” 

“We analyzed the data you 
sent on the Aingo sun. It’s pre- 
nova, Sims, and radiating like a 
bomb! It can flash at any mo- 
ment!” 

“Then the Delgen rescue mis- 
sion — ” 

“ Was technically a rescue mis- 
sion.” 

“And the case?” 

“It closed a few hours ago. The 
Moira courts declared the Ain- 
goes an inferior race, suitable for 
enslavement.” 

T>ACK at headquarters, Sims 
dumped all his evidence on 
the Chief’s desk. “Look at it! We 
can appeal, can’t we? Take the 
case to a higher court?” 

“We aren’t going to appeal,” 
the Chief said. 

“Rescuing a person doesn’t 
give anyone a right to enslave 
him,” Sims said angrily. “Now 
we’ve got something to base an 
appeal on.” 

“We aren’t going to appeal. 
That’s orders.” 

“Your orders?” 

“Orders from the Council. 



They checked all the physical 
data on the Aingoes and decided 
not to fight the case any further.” 
Sims was so shocked, he sat 
down without being asked. “But 
why?” he demanded. 

“Don’t ask me,” the Chief said 
gloomily. 

“Do they think the Aingoes 
really should be enslaved, that it 
would be best, under the circum- 
stances?” 

“The Council isn’t in the habit 
of explaining its decisions to its 
clerks, janitors, secretaries, or 
anybody else. Kindly stop asking 
me questions. You did a fine job, 
Sims. Now forget it.” 

“I resign,” Sims said. 

“I don’t accept your resigna- 
tion.” The Chief glared angrily 
at him. “Do you think the Ain- 
goes are the only race in the Gal- 
axy? It’s the others we’ve got to 
worry about, because there’s real- 
ly going to be trouble now. Get 
your ship checked out.” 

Sims saluted stiffly and hurried 
out to his ship. 

A SWARM of journalists de- 
scended on Delge IV and a 
flood of books was written on the 
first authorized slavery in the 
Confederacy. 

A steady stream of beautiful 
garden products continued to be 
shipped from Delge. 

If there is one thing typical of 
would-be slavers, it is that they 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




won’t sit back and envy a suc- 
cessful slaver’s good luck. All 
over the Confederacy, planets 
short of labor and without funds 
for machinery tried to turn the 
precedent into a rule, just as the 
Chief had predicted. 

The courts were choked with 
cases. Sims, along with the other 
Council agents, was furiously 
busy tracking down evidence to 
break them. ' 

“We can’t let another Aingo 
case happen again,” the Chief 
said. “If it does, we’re sunk. I 
want every single one smashed 
. and smashed flat!” 

It took trickery and sometimes 
bloodshed to get the evidence, 
but the agents brought it back. 
The Council scientists discovered 
and the Council lawyers proved 
example after example of drug- 
ging, hypnosis and memory-era- 
sure on a mass scale. 

The trick, of course, had been 
to make intended slave races as 
nearly like the Aingoes as possi- 
ble. The counter-measure was to 
find out how it was done in each 
instance. Knowing what to look 
for, the scientists won every time, 
though a few cases looked hope- 
less right up to the last moment. 

Sims was called back to Head- 
quarters. He was exhausted, but 
the Chief and the others looked 
close to collapse. They were all 
haggard, edgy, worried. 

“We can’t go on like this,” the 



Chief said. “The slavers know 
how busy we’re kept, so they’re 
increasing the pressure. We’re 
bound to slip up sooner or later 
and then they’ll have us.” 

“We could add more agents,” 
said Sims, “hire more scientists 
and lawyers.” 

“Budget,” the Chief replied 
wearily. “We don’t have the mon- 
ey. You can’t ask people to work 
for nothing.” 

“There are some who will.” 
The Chief looked unbelievingly 
at him. “Who, for instance?” 
“People we helped escape sla- 
very. Pick the smartest, train 
them — ” 

“I’m ahead of you,” said the 
Chief, jumping to his feet. “And 
I’ve got just the man to take 
charge of the training program.” 
“You have? Who?” 

“You,” the Chief said. 

“But I’m needed out in the 
field,” Sims objected. “My sector 
is falling behind schedule.” 

“We all are. Get busy and may- 
be we can beat back this damned 
assault.” 

S IMS pushed through whole 
classes of agents; the races 
that had escaped enslavement 
were eager to cooperate and many 
of their representatives were 
bright as well as eager. Some 
were not, though, and they were 
added as brawn, which was need- 
ed more and more as the battle 



UNCLE TOM'S PLANET. 



67 




grew tougher and more audaci- 
ous. The courts weren’t choked 
any more; they were nearly 
drowned in the tidal wave of 
cases. Sims had no solution for 
this, nor did anyone else. 

“That’s the loophole they’ll 
get us by,” said the Chief gloom- 
ily. “We’re through, or will be in 
a little while. I’ve been going on 
the principle that a good general 
never knows when he’s licked, 
but I’d have to be a complete 
idiot not to recognize an abso- 
lutely hopeless situation when I 
see one. I’m just praying the 
Dark Ages don’t last too long, 
once they descend on us.” 

It was then that a call came 
through from Delge. When the 
Chief took it, his face brightened 
and his back grew straight and 
proud again. 

“Get a ship ready, Sims,” he 
snapped out in his old brisk style. 
“There’s a petition for a change 
of status on Delge.” 

Sims rocked back, astonished. 
“You mean those miserable Ain- 
go runts are rioting?” 

“Worse,” the Chief grinned 
cheerfully. 

Sims was baffled all the way 
to Delge. 

Upon landing, they were met 
by a delegation of towering seven - 
foot Delgens. Even before they 
left the ship, the Delgens were 
shouting : 

“ — won’t stand for it!” 



“ — no justice in the Galaxy!” 
“— doublecrossed by the Coun- 
cil!” 

Then a solitary Aingo appeared 
— simply appeared — out of the 
empty air. Physically, he was the 
same as Sims remembered, but as 
tall now as the Delgens and there 
was something almost over- 
whelming about his confident 
bearing. 

“Quiet!” the Aingo ordered. 
The Delgens instantly became 
silent. 

“I beg forgiveness,” the Aingo 
said diplomatically. “I should 
have had them penned before 
your arrival. They’re such vo- 
ciferous beasts — ” 

“Penned?” Sims repeated 
blankly. 

“Of course. We keep the slaves 
penned when they aren’t work- 
ing. They taught us the practice 
when the situation was reversed.” 
“But I thought . What the 
hell has happened here?”. 

“I think your superior should 
explain that.” 

T HE Chief was grinning satis- 
fiedly. “You don’t get it?” 
“Am I supposed to?” Sims 
asked in confusion. 

“No. The Council didn’t, either, 
till the Aingoes radioed us for a 
change of status — ” 

“The Aingoes did?” 

“Sure. Their race was going 
through a period of high muta- 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tional change. It began as a retro- 
gression, a rapid sinking from civ- 
ilization to savagery, as a result 
of the radiation from their pre- 
nova sun. The Delgens found 
them at the absolute null.” 

“And then the mutation re- 
versed itself,” Sims finished daz- 
edly, “as soon as they were out 
of the radiation field. Well, 
there’s no problem. We just get 
the court to throw out the slavery 
decision.” 

“It’s not that simple,” said the 
Chief. “The Aingoes want to en- 
slave the Delgens now!” 

“What?” 

“All right, we made a mistake,” 
a Delgen plucked up enough 
courage to protest. “But that’s 
no reason to enslave us.” 

“You are an inferior race,” the 
Aingo pointed out. “Can you 
transpose instantaneously? Can 
you grommich? Can you stel?” 
The Delgen looked humiliated. 
“No, but still it’s wrong to en- 
slave us.” 

“Wrong? Oh, no question of it. 
But since it’s in a good cause, 
you will remain slaves until we 
decide otherwise — if we ever do. 
Now back to your pens!” 

The Aingo’s voice was stem, 
but Sims detected a note of 
amusement in it, a hint of un- 
vindictive humor. 

“So that’s the gag,” he said 
wryly, after the Delgens were 
penned and the Aingo returned. 



“The Aingoes are in on this with 
us.” 

“Of course,” grinned the Chief, 
enjoying it all. “They have no 
more use for slavery than the 
Council has. They just want to 
show what might happen to peo- 
ple who use the relative-inferi- 
ority rulings. Just like the 
Delgens now, they might find 
themselves trying to prove 
they’re no such thing one day.” 

“And the Council will play 
along?” 

“What do you think?” 

Sims looked anxiously at the 
Aingo. He received something 
very much like a good-natured 
wink. 

Smiling, Sims took a form out 
of his pocket and began to fill in 
the pertinent data. 

. when one considers the 
unusual benefits accruing from 
this particular enslavement, one 
can only approve the Council's 
course. The Delgens, at this writ- 
ing, have been twenty years fight- 
ing in the courts for their lost 
independence. This sorry state of 
affairs has given pause to the 
slave-minded. Indeed, the Aingo 
trick has done more to enforce the 
Slave Act than any conceivable 
number of Council Cutters might 
have done.

inevitably — the instant they came 
near Alcorn. 

Finding Kitty’s cool blonde 
loveliness projected so abruptly 
against the bleak polar plain of 
his waking dream, he knew how 
much more she was than either 
fiancee or secretary alone. She 
was a beacon of reassurance in a 
sea of uncertainty. 

“Thanks, darling,” he said, and 
looked at his watch. “I’d have 
woolgathered past my appoint- 
ment and it’s an important one.” 

He stood up. Kitty came closer 
and put both hands on his shoul- 
ders. 

“You’ve had another of those 
dreams, haven’t you? I wish 
you’d see a — a doctor about 
them.” 

He laughed, and if the sound 
rang hollow, she seemed not to 
notice. 

“That’s why I asked you to 
call me. I’ve made an appoint- 
ment with one.” 

S HE stood on tiptoe to kiss him. 

“I’m glad you’re decided. You 
haven’t been yourself at all for a 
week, Philip, and I couldn’t bear 
a honeymoon with a preoccupied 
husband!” 

He managed the appropriate 
leer, though he had never felt less 
like it. The apprehension that fol- 
lowed his daytime chimera was 
on him again, so strongly that 
what he wanted most to do was 



to take Kitty’s hand tightly, like 
a frightened child, and run head- 
long until he was beyond reach 
of whatever it was that threat- 
ened him. 

“Small chance,” he said, in- 
stead. “Any man who’d dream 
away a honeymoon with you is 
dead already.” 

She sighed placidly and turned 
back to the business at hand. 
“You won’t be late for your 16:00 
conference with our Mr. O’Don- 
nell and Director Mulhall of Ir- 
radiated Foods, will you? Poor 
Sean would be lost without you.” 
He felt the usual nagging dis- 
satisfaction with the peculiar tal- 
ent that had put him where he 
was in Consolidated Advertising. 
“He’d probably lose this case 
without my soothing presence and 
CA would pay its first unground- 
ed refund claim in — ” he counted 
back over the time he had been 
with Consolidated — “four years 
and eight months.” 

Kitty said wistfully, “Shall I 
see you tonight, Philip?” 

He frowned, searching for a 
way to ease the hurt she would 
feel later, and finding none. “That 
depends on the psychiatrist. If 
he can’t help me, I may fly up 
to my cabin in the Catskills and 
wrestle this thing out for myself.” 
Kitty moved to go, and then 
turned back. “I almost forgot. 
There was a call for you at noon 
from a secretary of Victor Jaffers’ 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




at Carter International. She 
seemed to know you’d be out and 
said that Mr. Jaffers would call 
again at 15:00.” 

“Victor Jaffers?” Alcorn re- 
peated. The name added a further 
premonitory depression. “I think 
I know what he wants. It’s hap- 
pened before.” 

When Kitty had gone, Alcorn 
took a restless turn about the 
room and was interrupted at once 
by the gentle buzzing of the rado- 
phone unit on his desk. He press- 
ed the receiving stud and found 
himself facing Victor Jaffers’ 
image. 

“Don’t bother to record this,” 
Jaffers said without preamble. 
“Complete arrangements have al- 
ready been made to prove that 
I’ve never spoken to you in my 
life.” 

J AFFERS was a small, still- 
faced man who might have 
been mistaken for a senior ac- 
countant’s clerk — until the chill 
force of his eyes made itself felt. 
Alcorn had seen the Carter Inter- 
national head before only in tele- 
print pictures, had heard and dis- 
counted the stories about the 
man’s studied ruthlessness. But 
those eyes and the blunt ap- 
proach made him wonder. 

“I’ve got a place in the contact 
branch of my organization for 
your particular talent, Alcorn,” 
Jaffers said flatly. “It will pay 



you five times what you earn with 
Consolidated. You understand 
why I’m taking you on.” 

“I know.” The arrogance wea- 
ried rather than angered Alcorn. 
“I have a gift for arranging fair 
settlements when both principals 
are present. Mr. Jaffers, I’ve never 
exploited my gift for personal 
profit. That’s a matter of self- 
protection as well as ethics — I 
don’t like trouble.” He reached 
for the canceling stud to end the 
interview. “Others have made the 
same offer before you and there’ll 
be others again. But I won’t use 
my ability unfairly.” 

Jaffers smiled, unamused. “You 
do go straight to the point, which 
saves argument. But you’ll work 
for me, Alcorn. Those others 
made the mistake of talking to 
you personally. I know that you 
can be reached as easily as any 
other man if my agents keep 
more than fifty feet away from 
you.” His eyes moved past Alcorn 
to the window. “Look at the win- 
dow across the street.” 

Alcorn, turning, felt his neck 
prickle. Across the narrow canyon 
of street, without pretense at con- 
cealing himself, a man in gray 
clothing watched him from an 
open office window. 

“I’ve had you under surveil- 
lance for days,” Jeffers’ voice said 
behind him. “I’ve located two 
others of your sort since my stat- 
isticians brought their existence

73 




to my attention, but somehow 
they slipped through my fingers 
this week. I’m taking no chances 
on you.” 

Alcorn whirled back incredu- 
lously. “You’ve found others? 
Where and — ” 

“I’ll tell you that when you’re 
on my payroll.” 

“It’s a trick,” Alcorn said angri- 
ly. “I searched for years before I 
settled down with Consolidated 
and I didn’t find a trace of any- 
body like myself. I don’t believe 
there are any.” 

“Most of them covered them- 
selves better.” Jaffers added, with 
cold finality, “I don’t haggle, Al- 
corn. You’ll work for me or for 
no one.” 

“^TiHE trouble is,” Alcorn said, 
“that I’m different from 
other people and I have to know 
why. I know how I’m different, 
but if I knew why, I’d never have 
come to a psychiatrist.” 

Dr. Hagen rattled the data 
sheet in his hands and blinked be- 
hind his pince-nez like a friendly 
beagle. He was a very puzzled 
man, being accustomed to ana- 
lyzing his own reactions as well 
as those of his patients. Alcorn 
could see him struggling to ac- 
count for the sudden serenity that 
had come over him the instant 
Alcorn entered the office — cer- 
tainly it was not the doctor’s 
usual frame of mind, from the 



first sour look of him — and fail- 
ing. 

“Different in what way, Mr. 
Alcorn?” 

“I soothe people,” Alcorn said. 
“There’s something about me that 
inspires trust and an eagerness to 
please. Everyone roughly within 
a radius of fifty feet — I’ve check- 
ed the limit a thousand times —

phoria. They’re as happy as so 
many children at a picnic and 
they can’t do enough for me or 
for each other.” 

Dr. Hagen blinked, but not with 
disbelief. 

“It affects psychiatrists, too,” 
Alcorn went on. “You’d cheer- 
fully waive the fee for this con- 
sultation if I asked it, or lend 
me fifty credits if I were strapped. 
The point is that people are never 
difficult when I’m around, be- 
cause I was born with the un- 
likely gift of making them happy. 
That gift is the most valuable 
asset I own, but I’ve never un- 
derstood it — and as long as I 
don’t understand it, there’s the 
chance that it may be a mixed 
blessing. I think it’s backfired on 
me already in one fashion and 
possibly in another.” 

He shook out a cigarette and 
the psychiatrist obligingly held 
a lighter to it. Dr. Hagen, Alcorn 
thought, must normally have 
been an exceptionally strong- 
willed man, for he hesitated no-

else you would not have con- 
tented yourself with your com- 
paratively minor job. But your 
profession as claims adjustor 
must impose a considerable strain 
upon your nervous organization. 
Add to this that you are a bache- 
lor at the age of thirty-three 
and the natural conclusion — ” 

I N spite of his mood, Alcorn 
laughed. “Wrong tack — re- 
member my gift! Besides, I’m en- 
gaged to be married next month 
and I’m quite happy with the 
prospect. This trouble of mine is 
something entirely different. It’s 
tied in somehow with my talent 
for soothing and it scares me.” 
He could have added that 
Jaffers’ hardly veiled threat on 
his life disturbed him as well, 
but saw no point in wasting time 
on the one danger he understood 
perfectly. 

“This vision,” Alcorn said, “and 
the sensory sharpness and con- 
viction of disaster that come with 
it — it’s no ordinary hallucination. 
It’s as real as my peculiar talent 
and represents a very real danger. 
It’s working some sort of change 
in me that I don’t like and I’ve 
got to find out what that change 
is or I’m done for. I feel that.” 
Obligingly, the psychiatrist 
said, “Describe your experience.” 
Talking about it made pers- 
piration stand out on Alcorn’s 
forehead. “First I’m seized with a 



sudden sense of abnormally 
sharpened perception, as if I were 
on the point of becoming aware 
of a great many things beyond 
my immediate awareness. I can 
feel the emotions of people about 
me and I have the conviction 
that, in another moment, I shall 
be able to feel their thoughts as 
well. 

“Then I seem to be standing 
alone on a frozen arctic plain, a 
polar wasteland that should be 
utterly deserted, but isn’t. I’ve 
no actual sensations of touch or 
hearing, yet the scene is visually 
sharp in every detail. 

“There’s a small village of cor- 
rugated sheet-metal houses just 
ahead, the sort that engineers on 
location might raise, and the 
streets between are packed with 
snow. Machines loaded with 
metal boxes crawl up and down 
those streets, but I’ve never seen 
their drivers. Until this morning, 
I never saw any people at all on 
the plain.” 

Dr. Hagen rattled his paper 
and nodded agreeably. “Go on. 
What are these people like?” 

“I can’t tell you that,” Alcorn 
said, “because their images were 
not complete. There seems to be 
a sort of relationship between 
them and myself — a threatening 
one — but I can’t guess what it 
may be. I can’t even tell you what 
racial type they belong to, be- 
cause they have no faces.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




TTE crushed out his cigarette 
and took a deep breath, get- 
ting to the worst of it. “I have a 
distinct conviction during each of 
these seizures that the people I 
see are not ordinary human be- 
ings, that they’re as different from 
me as I am from everyone else, 
though not in the same way. It’s 
the difference that makes me un- 
easy. I can feel the urgency and 
the resolution in them, as if they 
were determined to do — or had 
resigned themselves to doing — 
something desperately important. 
And then I know somehow that 
each of them has made some kind 
of decision recently, a decision 
that is responsible for his being 
what he is and where he is, and 
that I’ll have to make a similar 
one when the time comes. And 
the worst of it is that I know 
no matter which way my choice 
falls, I’m going to be hideously 
unhappy.” 

The psychiatrist asked tran- 
quilly, “You can’t guess what 
choice it is that you must make, 
or its alternative?” 

“I can’t. And that’s the hell of 
it — not knowing.” 

The icy chill of the polar plain 
touched him and with it came a 
deeper cold that had not been a 
part of the dream. At that in- 
stant, he might have identified its 
source, but was afraid to. 

“My fear has some relation to 
whatever it is these people are 



about to do,” he said. “I just 
realized that. But that doesn’t 
help, because I’ve no idea what 
it is.” 

He glanced at his strap watch, 
and the time made him stand up 
before the little psychiatrist could 
speak again. The hour was 15:57, 
and he saw in dismay that his 
16:00 appointment with Sean 
O’Donnell and the Irradiated 
Foods tycoon would be late. 

“I don’t expect an immediate 
opinion,” he said. “You couldn’t 
reach one as long as I’m here. 
Add up what I’ve told you, and 
if it makes any sort of sense you 
can radophone me tonight at 
19:00. If my apartment doesn’t 
answer, relay the call to my cabin 
in the Catskills — I’ve kept the 
location a secret, for privacy’s 
sake, but the number is on alter- 
nate listing.” 

He paused briefly at the door, 
touched with an uncharacteristic 
flash of sour humor. “And tele- 
stat your bill to me. If I asked 
for it now, you’d probably charge 
nothing.” 

J’T'HE mood vanished as soon as 
he was outside and saw the 
gray-suited Jaffers operative 
waiting with stolid patience on 
the ramp of a department store 
across the street. 

The shock of reminder brought 
on a giddy recurrence of his hal- 
lucination.

The polar plain yawned before 
him. The silent machines crept 
over their snow-packed ways, the 
faceless people stood in frozen 
groups. 

He emerged from the seizure, 
shaken and sweating, to find that 
the Jaffers man had crossed the 
street and was waiting a safe dis- 
tance behind. Alcorn fought down 
a panic desire to run away blind- 
ly only because Kitty would be 
waiting for him at Consolidated 
— Kitty, his bulwark of reassur- 
ance. 

The gray- suited man was a 
deliberate hundred feet behind 
him when he boarded a tube-car. 

Kitty was not in his office and 
there was no time to ring for her. 

Instead, he went through the 
long accounting room beyond, an- 
swering automatically the smiles 
of a suddenly genial staff and 
headed for O’Donnell’s office. 

He saw at once that he was too 
late. 

The CA manager’s door was 
open and O’Donnell and Mulhall 
of Irradiated Foods were emerg- 
ing. Both wore street jackets and 
both men had the unmistakable 
air of euphoric calm that came 
within seconds of Alcorn’s ap- 
proach. 

O’Donnell gave Alcorn his 
familiar long-lipped grin, look- 
ing, with his thin gentle face and 
rteat brush of ermine-white hair, 
like an aristocratic Irish saint. 



“You missed a pleasant meet- 
ing,” O’Donnell said. “I’ve just 
signed a refund release to Charlie 
here, and a pleasure it was.” 
The awareness that they had 
been calmed before he’d arrived 
left Alcorn speechless. 

“Really shouldn’t have ac- 
cepted,” Mulhall said sheepishly. 
Mulhall was a big, solid man, 
bald and paunchy and, when his 
normal instincts were controlled, 
an argumentative tyrant. “Nig- 
gling technicality, I say. Shouldn’t 
have taken a refund, but Sean 
here insisted.” 

They laughed together, like 
children sharing a joke. 

“The claim was justified,” 
O’Donnell said firmly. “Once 
Charlie’s secretary explained the 
case, there was no doubt.” 

Mulhall grinned at Alcorn. 
“Remarkable girl, Janice Wynn. 
She’s waiting in Sean’s office. 
Wants to meet you, Philip.” 
They went toward the lift with 
their arms about each other, shar- 
ing an all-too-brief moment of 
companionship. 

A LCORN hesitated in front of 
the closed door of O’Don- 
nell’s office. 

When he entered, Janice Wynn 
was standing at the window, 
watching the soundless rush of 
traffic in the street below. She 
was dark, not pretty in any con- 
ventional sense, but charged with 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




a controlled vitality that made 
physical beauty unimportant. 

Her face was anything but 
serene, the complex of emotions in 
her tilted green eyes far removed 
from the ready placidity he had 
learned to expect. There was an 
unmistakable impression of driv- 
ing urgency — the same urgency, 
Alcorn thought, that he had felt 
in the people of his waking dream. 

“You’re one,’’ he said. His face 
felt stiff. “After all these years, 
I’ve found another one like — ” 
“Like yourself,” she said. “But 
it’s I who have found you. Did 
you really think you were unique, 
Philip Alcorn?” 

He tried to answer and 
couldn’t. The meeting he had 
dreamed of all his life had come 
about with precisely the electric 
suddenness he had imagined, but 
he felt none of the elation he had 
anticipated. He felt, instead, a 
sudden panic. 

For behind Mulhall’s secretary, 
he had a shutter-swift glimpse of 
the frozen plain, starkly clear 
with its huddle of metal buildings 
and its faceless people clustered 
on the snow-packed street. 

J ANICE Wynn gave him no 
time to flounder for control. 
“You’re the last,” she said. 
“And the most stubborn of the 
lot. you’re lucky that we could 
find you in the little time we have 
left.” 



Alcorn said hoarsely, “I don’t 
know what you mean.” 

She looked more disappointed 
than surprised. “You’ve no ink- 
ling yet? I’ve known most of the 
truth for days, though I still 
haven’t made the change. Your 
conditioning must have been too 
thorough or — ” 

She caught the shift of Alcorn’s 
glance toward the window and 
turned quickly. The man in gray 
was watching them intently from 
the office across the street. 

“You’re under surveillance!” 
she said sharply. “By whom and 
for how long?” 

He told her of Jaffers’ call, and 
winced at the sudden dismay in 
her face. 

“At best you’ve killed an in- 
offensive psychiatrist with your 
problem,” she said. “At worst — ” 
She came around O’Donnell’s 
desk toward him, her manner 
abruptly decisive. “We’ve less 
time than I hoped. Come out of 
here, quickly.” 

In the corridor, she opened her 
handbag and took out a thick 
white envelope. “There’s no time 
now for explanations. The clip- 
pings will give you an idea of 
what you’re up against. Lose your 
spy if you can and don’t go near 
your apartment. I’ll be at your 
cabin tonight at 21:00. You’ll 
learn the rest then.” 

She pressed a stud at the ele- 
vator bank and chose an as-

cending lift. Alcorn realized that 
there would be a turbo-copter 
waiting for her on the roof. 

She faced Philip before enter- 
ing the cage. “You have no chance 
at all except with us. Remember 
that, or you’ll regret it for the 
rest of your very short life.” 

Alcorn made no attempt to fol- 
low. 

. except with us,” Janice 
Wynn had said. 

Us? 

She was like himself, gifted 
with his own talent. She was con- 
nected somehow with the faceless 
people of his hallucinations. 

Who were they, and where 
were they, and what did they 
want of him? 

H E was still groping for the 
answers when Kitty came to- 
ward him. She gave a little cry 
of dismay when she saw his face. 

“You look simply awful, 
Philip! Is it another of your — ” 
With Kitty’s arrival, Alcorn’s 
premonition of disaster returned. 
Something was going to happen 
to him, was happening to him, 
and unless he moved carefully, it 
could involve Kitty as well. He 
had to keep Kitty out of this, 
which meant that he must stay 
clear of her until he was safe. 

“It’s nothing,” he said hastily. 
“I’ll call you later, Kitty. I’ve 
another appointment now that 
can’t wait.” 



She put out a hesitant hand. 
“Philip . .” 

He wanted desperately to tell 
her the whole improbable story, 
to reveal his fears and get the 
reassurance she was able to give 
him. 

But he couldn’t risk involv- 
ing Kitty in any danger. 

“It’s nothing,” he repeated. He 
went down the lift quickly be- 
cause he knew that if he delayed 
to comfort her, he would never 
have the courage to go at all. 

His only clear thought, as he 
shouldered his way into the late- 
afternoon throng outside CA, had 
been to escape from Kitty and 
from the too-vivid memory of 
Janice Wynn. Now that he must 
choose a course, he was brought 
up short by the fact that, so. long 
as he was tailed by Jaffers’ men, 
there was literally no place for 
him to go. 

He could not go to his apart- 
ment because of Jaffers’ surveil- 
lance. He had no intention of 
meeting Janice Wynn at his Cat- 
skill cabin at 21:00. Her obvious 
knowledge — and, therefore, theirs 
— of the location ruled that out 
as a refuge. 

He looked about for the in- 
evitable man in gray and found 
him following at his careful hun- 
dred feet. The crowd caught and 
bore them both along like chips 
in a millrace, keeping the interval 
constant.

A LCORN let himself be carried 
along, feeling the slow release 
of tension that spread outward 
from him through the throng. 
The physical pressure was also 
eased. People slowed their dogged 
pace and smiled at utter strang- 
ers. 

He had wondered often how the 
people affected by his circle of 
calm accounted for their sudden 
change of mood. He had dreamed 
that one day he might walk in 
such a crowd and enter another 
island of serenity like his own 
and thus find another human be- 
ing gifted like himself. Someone 
with his own needs and longings, 
who would not melt into ready 
complaisance when he drew near, 
but who would speak honestly 
and clearly, who would under- 
stand how he felt and why. 

Ironically, when that moment 
had come in O’Donnell’s office, it 
hadn’t brought him the fulfill- 
ment he had expected. It had left, 
instead, a panic beyond belief. 
Why? What was he afraid of? 
There was nothing evil or dan- 
gerous in his own gift — why 
should he fear another possessing 
the same wild talent? Damn it, he 
thought, what sort of fate could 
be so terrible that its foreshadow- 
ing alone could throw him into 
such an anxious state? 

How could he be sure that the 
faceless people were hostile? If 
they were like Janice Wynn, and 



if Janice were like himself, it 
might follow naturally that — 
The rustle of the envelope in 
his pocket was like an answer, 
proving that his problem, if noth- 
ing else, was real. 

. for the rest of your very 
short life,” she had said. 

T HE sudden sharpening of 
awareness that preceded a new 
seizure rasped him again. He felt 
the tranquillity about him, and 
then the arctic montage swal- 
lowed it all, and once again he 
stood bodiless on the snow-pack- 
ed streets of the metal village. 

The faceless people moved pur- 
posefully now, and beyond them 
loomed the towering bulk of 
scaffolding erected about the pit 
where the great bronze cylinder 
of a ship lay . 

Pit? 

Scaffolding? 

Ship? 

He stopped so abruptly that a 
man behind him stumbled and 
regained balance only by clutch- 
ing Alcorn’s shoulder. 

“Sorry,” the man murmured, 
and moved on. 

The mirage vanished; the 
crowd behind pushed on, parting 
politely about Alcorn. The mass 
farther back surged restlessly, 
hurrying, grumbling like an im- 
patient corporate organism. The 
Jaffers agent, caught in the press, 
was borne helplessly nearer.

Alcorn realized his opportunity 
and stood fast, waiting while the 
tide of bodies flowed past. The 
man in gray saw his intention and 
struggled frantically to break free 
of the pinioning crowd. 

He failed. 

A sort of grim satisfaction fell 
upon Alcorn when the man’s 
face lost its urgency and settled 
into smiling unconcern. The gift 
was a weapon of sorts. The way 
to escape — at least from Jaffers’ 
surveillance — was open. 

He fell in beside the spy, pay- 
ing less attention now to the man 
himself than to the matter of dis- 
posing of him. The garish facade 
of a nearby joy-bar solved his 
problem. 

“Come with me,” Alcorn or- 
dered. 

rpHE joy-bar was less than half 
full at this early hour, but 
noisy enough for midnight. A 
concealed battery of robotics 
ground out a brassy blare of 
music, integrating random pitches 
— selected by electronic servo- 
computers — into the jarring min- 
or cacophony that had become 
the latest rage. 

The early patrons were intently 
watching the long telescreen 
above the bar when Alcorn came 
in. A quarterstaff bout — a frantic, 
bloody sport revived from God 
only knew how many centuries 
before — was 'in progress there, 



matching a heavily muscled Nor- 
dic with a sandy bristle of hair 
against a swarthy, hairless Eu- 
rasian. The Nordic, from his 
twisted stance, had a couple of 
broken ribs already; the Euras- 
ian’s right ear dangled redly. 

Alcorn seated himself opposite 
Jaffers’ operative in an isolated 
booth and fed the coin-slot for 
drinks. 

“Drink,” he said grimly. 
“You’re going to be drunker, my 
friend, than you’ve ever been in 
your inquisitive life.” 

The uproar died out before the 
drinks arrived. Only the blaring 
music machines and the blood- 
roar of the telescreen remained, 
and a suddenly placid bartender 
turned both down to a murmur. 

The rest was routine to Philip 
Alcorn’s experience. Men at the 
bar turned to each other like old 
friends, forgetting submerged 
frustrations as readily as they for- 
got the vicious slash -and -parry 
on the screen. The place drowsed 
in a slow and comfortable silence. 

The Jaffers man tossed off his 
drink and dialed another. Alcorn, 
raising his own, remembered 
Janice Wynn’s letter in his pocket 
and set the glass down, untasted. 

The clippings, she had said, 
would give him an idea of what 
he was up against. 

His hands shook so violently 
when he ripped open the envelope 
that he almost dropped it. 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




T7UGHT clippings were inside, 
■*-* small teleprinted scissorings 
from digest newssheets that were 
available at any street-corner 
dispenser. He read them quickly, 
and was more puzzled than be- 
fore until he realized that they 
fell into two general groups of 
interlocking similarities. 

Four were accounts of unex- 
plained disappearances. A mod- 
erately successful research chem- 
ist named Ellis had vanished 
from the offices of his New York 
chemical firm : a neighborhood 
pharmacist in Minneapolis, a 
spinster tea-shop proprietress in 
Atlanta and a female social work- 
er in Los Angeles had disappeared 
with equal thoroughness, com- 
pletely baffling the efforts of po- 
lice to find them. 

None of these people had been 
of more than minor importance, 
even in his own immediate circle. 
Alcorn felt that these events had 
been reported only because the 
efficiency of missing-persons bu- 
reaus made permanent disappear- 
ance next to impossible. Even so, 
only one clipping — that on Ellis, 
the New York chemist — bothered 
to run a photograph. ^ 

The other four accounts dealt 
with violent deaths, all rising 
from sudden outbreaks of mob 
hysteria. Two of the victims had 
been small-town clergymen, a 
profession which made their 
lynchings as startling as they were 



inexplicable; both had been re- 
spected members of their little 
communities until the day — the 
date was less than a week old — 
their congregations rose up en 
masse and tore them limb from 
limb. 

The remaining two of the sec- 
ond group had died in different 
fashions. A doctor in a Nevada 
mining hamlet, making a late call, 
had been set upon by the patient’s 
family, knocked unconscious and 
shot. A Girl Scout leader in Mis- 
sissippi had been thrown over a 
cliff by her young charges. 

A MORBID and pointless col- 
lection of horrors, Alcorn 
thought, until he saw the parallel 
that related them. 

The circumstances were strik- 
ingly similar in every case except 
that the four who disappeared 
were urbanites, while the mur- 
dered ones were all members of 
small and comparatively isolated 
communities. Not one of the eight 
had been over thirty-five; each 
had been well-liked; none was 
wealthy, yet all were in comfort- 
able circumstances from voca- 
tions that depended upon good 
will. 

A further similarity built up in 
Alcorn’s subconscious, but died 
unconsidered because at that mo- 
ment the quarterstaff bout on the 
screen ended and a brazen-voiced 
announcer gave the time. 



ASSIGNMENT'S END

It was 18:30. Dr. Hagen was to 
call him at his apartment at 
19:00. 

Alcorn, mulling over the cryp- 
tic half-knowledge gained from 
the clippings, wondered what the 
little psychiatrist might make of 
it. Hagen was capable in his field; 
even with so little to work on, he 
might possibly come up with the 
right answer. 

Alcorn decided that he could 
not run from a danger until he 
knew what the hazard was. He 
might as well face the issue 
squarely now and be done with it. 

The Jaffers operative, on his 
ninth drink, had relaxed into a 
smiling stupor. Alcorn left him 
snoring in the booth and headed 
for the public radophone unit be- 
yond the end of the bar. He could 
not be in his apartment to take 
Dr. Hagen’s call, but he could 
anticipate it. 

The telescreen announcer’s 
voice stopped him short. “ Have 
you seen this man? Sought by 
police for the murder earlier this 
evening of Dr. Bernard Hagen, 
prominent psychiatrist, he is 
thought to be at large somewhere 
in downtown ...” 

The screen showed an enlarged 
full-face photograph of Alcorn. 

TTE was responsible for Hagen’s 
death. But who had wanted 
the knowledge of Alcorn’s gift — 
or the suppression of that knowl- 



edge — badly enough to kill the 
psychiatrist for it? 

Jaffers, or the faceless people 
behind Janice Wynn? 

It had to be Jaffers, he decided, 
eliminating a possible source of 
opposition and at the same stroke 
placing himself still further on 
the defensive. 

Slowly, he became aware that 
the joy-bar had fallen quiet, that 
everyone in the place was watch- 
ing him with a sort of intent 
sympathy. The bartender left his 
place and came toward him, his 
heavy face a study in concern. 

“We know you couldn’t have 
done it,” the man said. The sway 
of Alcorn’s presence held him 
hypnotized. “Can we help?” 

Alcorn’s only thought was of 
flight. “Have you a turbo-cop- 
ter?” 

“On the roof,” the bartender 
said. “It’s yours.” 

Alcorn took him along to un- 
lock the controls. On the roof 
landing, a cool evening wind was 
blowing. There was a dim thin 
sickle of moon and a pale haze 
of stars, a wraithlike scattering of 
small white clouds that drifted in 
the reflected spectrum of the city’s 
multicolored glow. 

He sat in the turbo-copter with 
a feeling of incredulous unreality. 
The vast and shining breadth of 
the city was spread about him 
like a monstrous alien puzzle, a 
light-shot maze without meaning. 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Where, in that suddenly foreign 
tangle, could he go? 

He set the 'copter off at random, 
knowing that its owner would 
have the police on his heels the 
moment he recovered volition, 
Alcorn was still trying to settle 
upon a course when a seizure fell 
upon him again. 

First he had seen the city as 
something alien; now he felt it, 
a clamorous surf-roar of con- 
flicting individual emotions, an 
unresolved ant-hill scurrying of 
hates and hopes and endless frus- 
trations. 

Then he was on the polar plain. 
The pit and scaffolding were the 
same, but the enigmatic group- 
ings of people on the streets had 
changed. Four of them had faces 
now. Three were unfamiliar, but 
the fourth he recognized as Ellis, 
the research chemist who had dis- 
appeared from his laboratory in 
New York City. 

B Y the time Alcorn was com- 
posed, he discovered that he 
had chosen a course without con- 
scious intent. Dark, open country 
fled past beneath, pricked here 
and there with racing points of 
light that marked the main artery 
of northward surface traffic. 
Familiar mountain shapes loomed 
ahead, indicating where he was 
bound. 

He was heading, lemminglike, 
for his cabin in the Catskills. 

ASSIGNMENT'S END 



The knowledge made him won- 
der if he could trust the instinct 
that had decided him. Jaffers 
might or might not know of the 
cabin; certainly Janice Wynn 
knew, for she had said she would 
pick him up there at 21:00. 

Kitty, when he failed to call her 
as he had promised, would know 
at once where he had gone, and 
would either radophone him or 
come to him quickly. 

He frowned unhappily over the 
possibilities, caught between an 
eagerness to see Kitty and a 
dread of having her involved in 
his trouble. He considered taking 
Kitty and fleeing in his borrowed 
turbo-copter to some isolated 
place where the two of them 
might make a fresh start, and 
gave up the idea at once as worse 
than impractical. 

Jaffers would find him without 
difficulty, now that he knew what 
to look for. And there was the 
progressive reality of his visions 
— for he had ceased to think of 
them any more as hallucinations. 
The coming of Janice Wynn and 
the inexorable sharpening of his 
awareness proved that reality be- 
yond doubt. 

He found the twin-notched 
peak that landmarked his cabin. 
The cool of night and the moun- 
tain quiet, when he climbed out, 
were a tonic to his abraded nerves. 
There was a nostalgic calling of 
night-birds, the clean breath of 

85 




pines and, from some tangled 
rocky slope, the faint pervading 
perfume of wild honeysuckle. 

He had not guessed how sharp 
his awareness had become until 
he realized that someone was 
waiting for him inside the cabin. 

¥¥E halted outside, feeling like 
a man just recovering vision 
after a long blindness. Janice 
Wynn was in the cabin and she 
was alone. He knew that as cer- 
tainly as if he had seen her walk 
in. 

When he went in, she was 
standing before the wide cold 
mouth of the cabin’s fireplace. 
She wore the same quiet suit she 
had worn in O’Donnell’s office, 
and her tilted green eyes were 
at once relieved and anxious. 

“I was afraid you might have 
lost your head and run away,” she 
said. “It’s good you didn’t. There 
wouldn’t have been time to find 
you again — the change is too 
close on us both.” 

“Change?” 

She gave him a disappointed 
look. “I thought you’d have 
guessed by now the relation be- 
tween ourselves and those people 
in the clippings. You had another 
seizure in the ’copter, didn’t 
you?” 

He stared, too disconcerted to 
answer. 

“You saw four faces this time,” 
she went on, “where you had 



seen none before: And you recog- 
nized one.” 

“It was Ellis, the chemist,” Al- 
corn said. And with a numb pre- 
monition of the truth, he quietly 
asked, “How did you know that?” 
“You were broadcasting it like 
a beacon. We’re both in the last 
stages of the change. Now that 
our conditioning is lifting, we’re 
reverting to our original tele- 
pathic nature. That’s how they 
found you and me, as they found 
Ellis and the others — by tracking 
down our communication auras.” 
He said slowly, “Those four- 
why were they mobbed and kill- 
ed?” 

“Because the change caught 
them too suddenly for escape,” 
she said. “And because, in our 
natural state, we are incompat- 
ible with Man.” 

“With Man,” he repeated. 
“And what does that make us? 
Supermen or monsters?” 

“You’re still blinded by your 
conditioning,” she answered, “or 
you’d see that we’re neither, that 
we’re not even native to this 
planet. I don’t know a great deal 
more than that myself — I haven’t 
remembered it all yet, because 
the change isn’t complete . 

^HE broke off and, with both 
^ hands above the fireplace, 
gripped the rough stone of the 
mantelpiece. Her tilted green eyes 
burned with a contradictory play 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of emotions; the soft planes of 
her face seemed to shift and alter, 
seeking an impossible balance be- 
tween ecstasy and terror and a 
tearing, intolerable agony. 

“I’m learning the rest . now,” 
she whispered. “Sooner than . 
I thought.” 

He sensed the change that 
possessed her, the struggling of 
new emotions, the shattering of 
imposed concepts and condition- 
ings and their realigning to shape 
a new personality, a new person. 
He knew from that moment that 
she had been right, and that what 
he had feared from the beginning 
of his first seizure was about to 
happen to him. 

She closed her eyes briefly. 
When she opened them again, Al- 
corn drew back. Then resentment 
flared in him and he was sudden- 
ly furious, at the alteration of 
status that left him on the de- 
fensive. 

He remembered the clippings 
and understood something of the 
frustrated rage that must have 
gripped the howling mobs when 
they killed the two ministers and 
the Nevada doctor and the Girl 
Scout leader. 

Janice Wynn straightened from 
the fireplace, her head tilted as 
if she were listening to some 
sound beyond range of his own 
hearing. 

“Someone is coming,” she said. 
Her voice had changed as much 



as her face ; her eyes watched him 
with a remote yet curiously in- 
timate compassion. “Not our peo- 
ple. It isn’t time for them yet.” 

She was at the cabin door be- 
fore he realized that she had 
moved. 

“Stay here” she ordered. 
“Don’t open the door for anyone. 
For anyone, do you hear?” 

She was gone into the outside 
darkness. 

Alcorn felt it himself then, the 
indefinable certainty of approach. 
A turbo- copter, then another, 
slanting down toward his hide- 
away, two speeding machines 
filled with grimly intent men — 
Jaffers’ agents. 

The ’copters landed about a 
hundred yards away from the 
cabin. There was a dragging si- 
lence and then a booming, ampli- 
fied voice. 

“Alcorn, come out!” 

TTE stood fast, feeling above 
their tension the swift prog- 
ress of Janice Wynn through the 
darkness toward them. She was 
close to the nearer machine when 
he felt a sudden veering of her 
attention, followed the direction 
of her probing, and sensed an- 
other ’copter angling down out 
of the night. 

Her mental order was as urgent 
as a shout : Let no one in. No one! 

She moved on. The pilot of the 
third ’copter was only beginning

to assume identity to Alcorn’s 
sharpened senses when Janice 
Wynn drew within effective reach 
of the nearer grounded machine. 

The amplified voice was call- 
ing again: “Come out. Alcorn, or 
we’ll have to — ’’ 

It broke off short in a scream. 
There was a flurry of shots, a 
white flash in the darkness and a 
concussion that shook the cabin. 

He felt Janice turn and run 
purposefully through the dark- 
ness toward the second ’copter. 

The third machine was drop- 
ping in for landing when he iden- 
tified its pilot. 

“Kitty!” he breathed. “Dear 
God, Kitty!” 

She was at the door, the terror 
and tenderness of her crying over- 
whelming his flinching perception. 
“Philip, let me in! Philip darling, 
are you all right?” 

She was inside and in his arms 
before he could prevent it. 




She clung to him frantically 
until the effect of his presence 
calmed her. The terror went out 
of her eyes slowly, but the tears 
glistening on her cheeks con- 
tradicted her smile of relief. 

“Thank God you’re safe, 
Philip! When I heard on the visi- 
news about Dr. Hagen — ’’ 

Janice Wynn’s silent command 
was violent in Alcorn’s head. Put 
her out quickly! Do you want her 
there when your own change 
comes? 

He caught Kitty’s hands and 
drew her toward the door. 

“You can’t stay here, Kitty. 
There’s no time to explain. I’ll 
call later and tell you every- 
thing.” 

She showed her hurt beneath 
the placidity his gift imposed 
upon her. “If I must, Philip. 
But — ” 

He threw open the door. “Don’t 
argue, Kitty. For God’s sake, go!” 



rwiHE blast of the second turbo- 
copter’s explosion might have 
precipitated the seizure that took 
him just then. 

The polar plain sprang up 
about him, more terribly cold and 
stark than ever, its clustering 
buildings and metal machines 
standing out in such clear per- 
spective that he was certain he 
could have put out a hand and 
touched them. 

But the people were faceless no 
longer, except for one that knelt 
before the group in a tense at- 
titude. Janice Wynn stood over 
that one while its features filled 
in slowly, line by line, growing 
more and more familiar as the 
face neared identity. 

By the time Alcorn realized 
that it was his own face, the 
change was fully upon him. 

A vast icy wind roared in his 
ears. A force seized and flung him, 
distorted and disoriented, to in-

finity. There were darkness and 
terror and then a chorus of calm 
voices calling reassurance. Pain 
gripped him, and panic, and final- 
ly an ecstasy of remembering that 
was beyond imagining. 

Dimly, he heard Kitty’s 
screaming. Something struck him 
furiously on the shoulder and he 
felt his distant physical body 
struggle automatically for bal- 
ance. 

A second blow caught him on 
the temple and he fell heavily, 
his new awareness flickering to- 
ward unconsciousness. There was 
a confusion of voices about him 
and Kitty’s raw shrilling died 
away. 

He lay still, secure in the cer- 
tainty that he was no longer 
alone. 

Mind after mind brushed his, 
lightly, yet more warming than 
any clasping of hands, and with 
each touch, he identified and em- 
braced an old friend whose re- 
gard was dearer than his own life. 
He knew who they were. He was 
one of them — again. 

It’s over, Janice Wynn’s voice 
said gently. Do you remember 
me now, Filrinn? 

Janeen, he said. He stood up 
slowly. 

Her green eyes stirred with an 
emotion that matched his own. It 
was incredible that he could ever 
have forgotten — no matter how 
thoroughly he had absorbed 



the protective conditioning — the 
unity between himself and Jan- 
een. 

/ remember, he said. The won- 
der of it still dazed him. It’s good 
to be myself again. 

She sighed. If s good to know 
why they sent me, instead of one 
of the others, to bring you back. 
You remember that? 

“I remember,” he said aloud, 
as if he needed to say the words 
to make it true. “We were to- 
gether before this assignment for 
two hundred of these people’s 
years. We’ll be together again for 
hundreds more, now that we’re 
free to go — for when will we ever 
find another world that needs at- 
tention as this one needed it?” 

TIE saw the Earthgirl then, 
- 1-1 curled limply on the cabin’s 
sofa. 

Her stillness left him alarm- 
ed, surprised and ashamed that 
he should so readily have for- 
gotten an obligation. 

Her dishevelment, and the 
heavy brass fireplace poker on the 
rug beside the couch, told him 
the story at once. 

You came just in time, Janeen. 
Poor Kitty! You didn’t hurt her? 

Janeen shook her head. Of 
course not, Filrinn. I caught her 
mind before the sfioc/c of your 
change could derange it and — 
conditioned her. She’ll sleep until 
we’ve gone, and tomorrow Philip

Alcorn will be no more than a 
pale memory. 

Either my conditioning still 
lingers or my empathetic index is 
too' high . I'd like her to know 
the truth about us, Janeen, be- 
fore we go. 

He knelt beside the couch and 
smoothed the fair, tousled hair 
back from the Earthgirl’s quiet 
face. 

“I'm sorry it had to be like 
this, Kitty," he said. He spoke 
aloud, but his mind touched hers 
below the level of consciousness. 
He felt the slow, bewildered surge 
of response. “It’ll help you to 
forget, perhaps, if you know that 
we came here from a star system 
you’ll never hear of in your life- 
time, to study your people and to 
see what we could do to help 
them. 

“Alike in form, we are so far 
apart in nature that you could 
not have borne our real presence, 
so we buried our real selves under 
a mask of conditioning as deeply 
as we buried our ship under the 
ice of your planet’s pole. After 
ten years of study, our condition- 
ing was to lift slowly, so that we 
would realize who and what we 
were. But you are more like us 
than we had thought, and with 



some of us, the conditioning was 
too strong to break. 

“It may help to know that your 
likeness to us will bring our peo- 
ple together again when the time 
is right, that your children’s chil-^ 
dren may meet us on equal 
terms.” 

H E lifted her from the couch 
and carried her to her ’copter. 
He set the machine’s controls to 
automatic and stepped back. 
“Good-by, Kitty,” he said. 
Janeen was waiting for him in 
the cabin. 

The auxiliary shuttle is 'on its 
way to pick us up, Filrinn. We'll 
be gone within the hour. 

They stood together, linking 
their minds, sharing an ecstasy 
in the meshing of identities that 
was greater than any physical 
fulfillment. 

But we have that, too, Janeen 
said for his ears alone. And then, 
to the calm, smiling faces that 
lingered in the background of 
their mingled consciousness : 
Leave us. 

The faces withdrew and left 
them — like children just grown to 
awareness of their own marvelous 
gifts — alone.

1 told you before. Dr. 
Blair, it’s krandoor, so don’t ex- 
pect to vrillipax, because they 
just won’t stand for any. They’d 
sooner framish.” 

“Framish?” Jonathan heard his 
own voice played back by the 
recorder, tinny and slightly na- 
sal. “What is that, Mr. Easton?” 
“ You know. Like when you 
guttip. Carooms get awfully bev- 
vergrit. Why, I saw one actu- 
ally — ” 

“Let’s go back a little, shall 
we?” Jonathan suggested. “What 
does shurgub mean?” 

There was a pause while the 



machine hummed and the re- 
corder tape whirred. Jonathan 
remembered the look on Easton’s 
face when he had asked him that. 
Easton had pulled away slightly, 
mouth open, eyes hurt. 

“Why— why, I told you!” he 
had shouted. “Weeks ago! What’s 
the matter? Don’t you blikkel 
English?” 

Jonathan Blair reached out 
and snapped the switch on the 
machine. Putting his head in his 
hands, he stared down at the top 
of his desk. 

You learned Navajo in six 
months, he reminded himself 
fiercely. 

You are a highly skilled

linguist. What's the matter? 
Don’t you blikkel English? 

TTE groaned and started search- 
ing through his briefcase for 
the reports from Psych. Easton 
must be insane. He must! Rami- 
rez says it’s no language. Stough- 
ton says it’s no language. And /, 
Jonathan thought savagely, say 
it’s no language. 

But— 

Margery tiptoed into the study 
with a tray. 

“But Psych,” he continued 
aloud to her, “Psych says it must 
be a language because, they say, 
Easton is not insane!” 

“Oh, dear,” sighed Margery, 
blinking her pale blue eyes. 
“That again?” She set his coffee 
on the desk in front of him. “Poor 
Jonathan. Why doesn’t the In- 
stitute give up?” 

“Because they can’t.” He 
reached for the cup and sat glar- 
ing at the steaming coffee. 

“Well,” said his wife, settling 
into the leather chair beside him, 
“/ certainly would. My goodness, 
it’s been over a month now since 
he came back, and you haven’t 
learned a thing from him!” 

“Oh, we’ve learned some. And 
this morning, for the first time, 
Easton himself began to seem 
puzzled by a few of the things 
he was saying. He’s beginning to 
use terms we can understand. 
He’s coming around. And if I 



could only find some clue — some 
sort of — ” 

Margery snorted. “It’s just 
plain foolish! I knew the Insti- 
tute was asking for trouble when 
they sent the Rhinestead off. How 
do they know Easton ever got 
to Mars, anyway? Maybe he did 
away with those other men, cruis- 
ed around, and then came back 
to Earth with this made-up story 
just so he could seem to be a 
hero and — ” 

“That’s nonsense!” 

“Why?” she demanded stub- 
bornly. “Why is it?” 

“Because the Rhinestead was 
tracked, for one thing, on both 
flights, to and from Mars. Moon- 
base has an indisputable record 
of it. And besides, the instru- 
ments on the ship itself show — ” 
He found the report he had been 
searching for. “Oh, never mind.” 
“All right,” she said defiantly. 
“Maybe he did get to Mars. 
Maybe he did away with the 
crew after he got there. He knew 
the ship was built so that one 
man could handle it in an emer- 
gency. Maybe he — ” 

“Look,” said Jonathan patient- 
ly. “He didn’t do anything of the 
sort. Easton has been checked so 
thoroughly that it’s impossible to 
assume anything except, (a) he 
is sane, (b) he reached Mars and 
made contact with the Martians, 
(c) this linguistic barrier is a re- 
sult of that contact.”

ll^ARGERY shook her head, 
sucking in her breath. “When 
I think of all those fine young 
men,” she murmured. “Heaven 
only knows what happened to 
them!” 

“You,” Jonathan accused, 
“have been reading that column- 
ist — what’s-his-name? The one 
that’s been writing such claptrap 
ever since Easton brought the 
Rhinestead back alone.” 

“Cuddlehorn,” said his wife. 
“Roger Cuddlehorn, and it’s not 
claptrap.” 

“The other members of the 
crew are all alive, all — ” 

“I suppose Easton told you 
that?” she interrupted. 

“Yes, he did.” 

“Using double-talk, of course,” 
said his wife triumphantly. At 
the look on Jonathan’s face, she 
stood up in guilty haste. “All 
right, I’ll go!” She blew him a 
kiss from the door. “Richie and 
I are having lunch at one. Okay? 
Or would you rather have a tray 
in here?” 

“Tray,” he said, turning back 
to his desk and his coffee. “No, 
on second thought, call me when 
lunch is ready. I’ll need a break.” 

He was barely consious of the 
closing of the door as Margery 
left the room. Naturally he didn’t 
take her remarks seriously, but — 

He opened the folder of pic- 
tures and studied them again, 
along with the interpretations by 



Psych, Stoughton, Ramirez and 
himself. 

Easton had drawn the little 
stick figures on the first day of 
his return. The interpretations all 
checked — and they had been 
done independently, too. There 
it is, thought Jonathan. Easton 
lands the Rhinestead. He and the 
others meet the Martians. They 
are impressed by the Martians. 
The others stay on Mars. Easton 
returns to Earth, bearing a mes- 
sage. 

Question: What is the mes- 
sage? 

Teeth set, Jonathan put away 
the pictures and went back to 
the tape on the recorder. “Yes,” 
said his own voice, in answer to 
Easton’s outburst. “I do— er— 
blikkel English. But tell me, Mr. 
Easton, do you understand me?” 

“Under-stand?” The man 
seemed to have difficulty form- 
ing the word. “You mean — ” 
Pause. “Dr. Blair, I murv you. 
Is that it?” 

“Murv,” repeated Jonathan. 
“All right, you murv me. Do you 
murv this? I do not always murv 
what you say.” 

A laugh. “Of course not. How 
could you?” Suppressed groan. 
“Carooms,” Easton had murmur- 
ed, almost inaudibly. “Just when 
I almost murv, the kwakut goes 
freebie.” 

Jonathan flipped the switch on 
the machine. “Murv” he wrote 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




on his pad of paper. He added 
“Blikkel,” “Carooms” and “Free- 
bie.” He stared at the list. He 
should understand, he thought. 
At times it seemed as if he did 
and then, in the next instant, he 
was lost again, and Easton was 
angry, and they had to start all 
over again. 

S IGHING, he took out more 
papers, notes from previous 
sessions, both with himself and 
with other linguists. The difficul- 
ty of reaching Easton was unlike 
anything he had ever before 
tackled. The six months of Na- 
vajo had been rough going, but 
he had done it, and done it well 
enough to earn the praise of Old 
Comas, his informant. Surely, he 
thought, after mastering a lan- 
guage like that, one in which the 
student must not only learn to 
imitate difficult sounds, but also 
learn a whole new pattern of 
thought — 

Pattern of thought. Jonathan 
sat very still, as though move- 
ment would send the fleeting clue 
back into the corner from which 
his mind had glimpsed it. 

A whole new frame of refer- 
ence. Suppose, he toyed with the 
thought, suppose the Martian 
language, whatever it was, was 
structured along the lines of Na- 
vajo, involving clearly defined 
categories which did not exist in 
English. 



“Murv,” he said aloud. “I 
murv a lesson, but I blikkel a 
language.” 

Eagerly, Jonathan reached 
again for the switch. Categories 
clearly defined, yes! But the cate- 
gories of the Martian language 
were not those of the concrete or 
the particular, like the Navajo. 
They were of the abstract. Where 
one word “understand” would do 
in English, the Martian used 
two — 

Good Lord, he realized, they 
might use hundreds! They 
might — 

Jonathan turned on the ma- 
chine, sat back and made notes, 
letting the recorder run uninter- 
rupted. He made his notes, this 
time, on the feelings he received 
from the words Easton used. 
When the first tape was done, he 
put on the second. 

Margery tapped at the door 
just as the third tape was end- 
ing. “In a minute,” he called, 
scribbling furiously. He turned 
off the machine, put out his cig- 
arette and went to lunch, feeling 
better than he had in weeks. 

Richie was at the kitchen sink, 
washing his hands. 

“And next time,” Margery was 
saying, “you wash up before you 
sit down.” 

Richie blinked and watched 
Jonathan seat himself. “Daddy 
didn’t wash his hands,” he said. 

Margery fixed the six-year-old 



ROUGH TRANSLATION 



95 




with a stern eye. “Richard, don’t 
be rude." 

“Well, he didn't." Richie sat 
down and reached for his glass 
of milk. 

“Daddy probably washed be- 
fore he came in," said Margery. 
She took the cover off a tureen, 
ladled soup into bowls and pass- 
ed sandwiches, pretending not to 
see the ink-stained hand Jona- 
than was hiding in his lap. 

Jonathan, elated by the prom- 
ise of success, ate three or fouf 
sandwiches, had two bowls of 
soup and finally sat back while 
Margery went to get coffee. 

Richie slid part way off his 
chair, remembered, and slid back 
on again. “Kin I go?” he asked. 

“Please may I be excused," 
corrected his father. 

R ICHIE repeated, received a 
nod and ran out of the din- 
ette and through the kitchen, 
grabbing a handful of cookies 
on the way. The screen door 
banged behind him as he raced 
into the backyard. 

"Richie!” Margery started af- 
ter him, eyes ablaze. Then she 
stopped and came back to the 
table with the coffee. “That boy! 
How long does it take before 
they get to be civilized?” Jona- 
than laughed. “Oh, sure,” she 
went on, sitting down opposite 
him. “It’s funny to you. But if 
you were here all day long — ” 



She stirred sugar into her cup. 
“We should have sent him to 
camp, even if it would have 
wrecked the budget!” 

“Oh? Is it that bad?” 

Margery shuddered. “Some- 
times he’s a perfect angel, and 
then — It’s unbelievable, the 
things that child can think of! 
Sometimes I’m convinced chil- 
dren are another species alto- 
gether! Why, only this morn- 
ing — ’’ 

“Well,” Jonathan broke in, 
“next summer he goes to camp.” 
He stood up and stretched. 

Margery said wistfully, “I sup- 
pose you want to get back to 
work.” 

“Ummmm.” Jonathan leaned 
over and kissed her briefly. “I’ve 
got a new line of attack," he said, 
picking up his coffee. He patted 
his wife’s shoulder. “If things 
work out well, we might get away 
on that vacation sooner than we 
thought." 

“Really?" she asked, brighten- 
ing. 

“Really.” He left the table and 
went back to his den. 

Putting the next tape on the 
machine, he settled down to his 
job. Time passed and finally 
there were no more tapes to lis- 
ten to. 

He stacked his notes and 
began making lists, checking 
through the sheets of paper for 
repetitions of words Easton had 



ROUGH TRANSLATION 



97 




used, listing the various connota- 
tions which had occurred to Jon- 
athan while he had listened to 
the tapes. 

As he worked, he was struck 
by the similarity of the words 
he was recording to the occa- 
sional’ bits of double-talk he had 
heard used by comedians in the- 
aters and on the air, and he al- 
lowed his mind to wander a bit, 
exploring the possibilities. 

Was Martian actually such a 
close relative to English? Or had 
the Martians learned English 
from Easton, and had Easton 
then formed a sort of pidgin- 
English-Martian of his own? 

Jonathan found it difficult to 
believe in the coincidence of the 
two languages being alike, un- 
less — 

He laughed. Unless, of course, 
Earthmen were descended from 
Martians, or vice versa. Oh, well, 
not my problem, he thought 
jauntily. 

TTE stared at the list before 
him and then he started to 
sweat, softly at first, then louder. 
But no matter how loudly he 
swore, the list remained undeni- 
ably and obstinately the same: 

Freebie — Displeasure (Tape 3) 

Freebie — Elation (Tape 4) 

Freebie — Grief (Tape S) 

“How,” he asked the empty 
room, “can a word mean grief 

98 l 



and elation at the same time?” 
Jonathan sat for a few mo- 
i ments in silence, thinking back 
to the start of the sessions with 
Easton. Ramirez and Stoughton 
; had both agreed with him that 
Easton’s speech was phonemical- 
l ly identical to English. Jona- 
than’s trained ear remembered 
the pronunciation of “Freebie” 
, in the three different connota- 
tions and he forced himself to 
i admit it was the same on all 
I three tapes in question. 

Stuck again, he thought gloom- 
ily. 

Good-by, vacation! 

He lit a cigarette and stared 
i at the ceiling. It was like saying 
the word “die” meant something 
happy and something sad at one 
and the same, like saying — 
Jonathan pursed his lips. Yes, 
i it could be. If someone were in 
, terrible pain, death, while a thing 
of sorrow, could also mean re- 
lease from suffering and so be- 
come a thing of joy. Or it could 
mean sorrow to one person and 
i relief to another. In that case, 
what he was dealing with here 
was not only— 

The crash of the ball, as it 
sailed through the window be- 
hind his desk, lifted Jonathan 
right from his chair. Furious, his 
elusive clue shattered as surely 
as the pane of glass, he strode to 
the window. 

“Richie!” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




His son, almost hidden behind 
the lilac bush, did not answer. 

“I see you!” Jonathan bellow- 
ed. “Come here!” 

The bush stirred slightly and 
Richie peeped through the leaves. 
“Did you call me, Daddy?” he 
asked politely. 

Jonathan clamped his lips shut 
and pointed to the den. Richie 
tried a smile as he sidled around 
the bush, around his father, and 
into the house. 

“My,” he marveled, looking at 
the broken glass on the floor in- 
side. “My goodness!” He sat 
down in the leather chair to 
which Jonathan motioned. 

“Richie,” said his father, when 
he could trust his voice again, 
“how did it happen?” 

His son’s thin legs, brown and 
wiry, stuck out straight from the 
depths of the chair. There was a 
long scratch on one calf and nu- 
merous black-and-blue spots 
around both knees. 

“I dunno,” said Richie. He 
blinked his eyes, deeper blue than 
Margery’s, and reached up one 
hand to push away the mass of 
blond hair tumbling over his 
forehead. He was obviously try- 
ing hard to pretend he wasn’t in 
the room at all. 

J ONATHAN said, “Now, son, 
that is not a good answer. 
What were you doing when the 
ball went through the window?” 



“Watching,” said Richie truth- 
fully. 

“How did it go through the 
window?” 

“Real fast.” 

Jonathan found his teeth were 
clamped. No wonder he couldn’t 
decode Easton’s speech — he 
couldn’t even talk with his own 
son! 

“I mean,” he explained, his pa- 
tience wavering, “you threw the 
ball so that it broke the window, 
didn’t you?” 

“I didn’t mean it to,” said 
Richie. 

“All right. That’s what I want- 
ed to know.” He started on a 
lecture about respect for other 
people’s property, while Richie 
sat and looked blankly respect- 
ful. “And so,” he heard himself 
conclude, “I hope we’ll be more 
careful in the future.” 

“Yes,” said Richie. 

A vague memory came to Jon- 
athan and he sat and studied 
his son, remembering him when 
he was younger and first start- 
ing to talk. He recalled the time 
Richie, age three, had come bus- 
tling up to him. “Vransh!” the 
child had pleaded, tugging at his 
father’s hand. Jonathan had gone 
outside with him to see a baby 
bird which had fallen from its 
nest. “Vransh!” Richie had crow- 
ed, exhibiting his find. “Vransh!” 

“Do I get my spanking now?” 
asked Richie from the chair. His

eyes were wide and watchful. 

Jonathan tore his mind from 
still another recollection: the old 
joke about the man and woman 
who adopted a day-old French 
infant and then studied French 
so they would be able to under- 
stand their child when he began 
to talk. Maybe, thought Jona- 
than, it’s no joke. Maybe there 
is a language — 

“Spanking?” he repeated ab- 
sentmindedly. He took a fresh 
pencil and pad of paper. “How 
would you like to help with 
something, Richie?” 

The blue eyes watched care- 
fully. “Before you spank me or 
after?” 

“No spanking.” Jonathan 
glanced at the Easton notes, 
vaguely aware that Richie had 
suddenly relaxed. “What I’m go- 
ing to do,” he went on, “is say 
some words. It’ll be a kind of 
game. I’ll say a word and then 
you say a word. You say the 
first word you think after you 
hear my word. Okay?” He clear- 
ed his throat. “Okay! The first 
word is — house.” 

“My house.” 

“Bird,” said Jonathan. 

“Uh — tree.” Richie scratched 
his nose and stifled a yawn. 

D isappointed, Jonathan 

reminded himself that Richie 
at six could not be expected to 
remember something he had said 



when he was three. “Dog.” 

“Biffy.” Richie sat up straight. 
“Daddy, did you know Biffy had 
puppies? Steve’s mother showed 
me. Biffy had four puppies, Dad- 
dy. Four!" 

Jonathan nodded. He supposed 
Richie’s next statement would be 
an appeal to go next door and 
negotiate for one of the pups, and 
he hurried on with, “Carooms.” 
“Friends,” said Richie, eyes 
still shining. “Daddy, do you 
suppose we could have a pup — ” 
He broke off at the look on Jon- 
athan’s face. “Huh?” 

“Friends,” repeated Jonathan, 
writing the word slowly and un- 
steadily. “Uh — vacation.” 

“Beach,” said Richie cautious- 
ly, still looking scared. 

Jonathan went on with more 
familiar terms and Richie slow- 
ly relaxed again in the big chair. 
From somewhere in the back of 
his mind, Jonathan heard Mar- 
gery say, “Sometimes I think 
they’re a different species alto- 
gether.” He kept his voice low 
and casual, uncertain of what he 
was thinking, but aware of the 
fact that Richie was hiding some- 
thing. The little mantel clock 
ticked drowsily, and Richie be- 
gan to look sleepy and bored as 
they went through things like 
“car” and “school” and “book.” 
Then— 

“Friend,” said Jonathan. 
“Allavarg,” yawned Richie.

"No!” He snapped to, alert and 
wary. "I mean Steve.” 

His father looked up sharply. 
"What’s that?” 

"What?” asked Richie. 
"Richie,” said Jonathan, 
“what’s a Caroom?” 

The boy shrugged and mut- 
tered, “J dunno.” 

“Oh, yes, you do!” Jonathan 
lit a cigarette. "What’s an Alla- 
varg?” He watched the boy bite 
his lips and stare out the window. 
“He’s a friend, isn’t he?” coaxed 
Jonathan. “ Your friend? Does he 
play with you?” 

The blond head nodded slow- 
ly and uncertainly. 

"Where does he live?” persist- 
ed Jonathan. "Does he come over 
here and play in your yard? Does 
he, Richie?” 

The boy stared at his father, 
worried and unhappy. "Some- 
times,” he whispered. "Sometimes 
he does, if I call him.” 

"How do you call him?” asked 
Jonathan. He was beginning to 
feel foolish. 

"Why,” said Richie, "I just 
say ‘Here, Allavarg!’ and he 
comes, if he’s not too busy.” 
"What keeps him busy?” Such 
nonsense! Allavarg was undoubt- 
edly an imaginary playmate. 
This whole hunch of his was ut- 
ter nonsense. He should be at 
work on Easton instead of — 
“The nursery keeps him busy,” 
said Richie. “Real busy.” 



J ONATHAN frowned. Did 
Richie mean the greenhouse 
down the road? Was there a Mr. 
Allavarg who worked there? 
"Whose nursery?” 

"Ours.” Richie wrinkled his 
face thoughtfully. "I think I bet- 
ter go outside and play.” 

“Our nursery?” Jonathan 
stared at his son. "Where is it?” 
"I think I better go play,” said 
Richie more firmly, sliding off the 
chair. 

"Richard! Where is the nurs- 
ery?” 

The full lower lip began to 
tremble. “I can't tell you!” 
Richie wailed. "I promised!” 
Jonathan slammed his fist on 
the desk. “Answer me!” He knew 
he shouldn’t speak this way to 
Richie; he knew he was frighten- 
ing the boy. But the ideas racing 
through his mind drove him to 
find out what this was all about. 
It might be nothing, but it also 
might be — “Answer me, Rich- 
ard!” 

The child stifled a sob. "Here,” 
he said weakly. 

“Here? Where?” 

"In my house,” said Richie. 
"And Steve’s house and Billy’s 
and all over.” He rubbed his eyes, 
leaving a grimy smear. 

“All right,” soothed Jonathan. 
"It’s all right now, son. Daddy 
didn’t mean to scare you. Daddy 
has to learn these things, that’s 
all. Just like learning in school.”

The boy shook his head re- 
sentfully. “ You know,” he ac- 
cused. “You just forgot.” 

“What did I forget, Richie?” 

“You forgot all about Alla- 
varg. He told me I It was a dif- 
ferent Allavarg when you were 
little, but it was almost the same. 
You used to play with your Al- 
lavarg when you were little like 
me!” 

Jonathan took a deep breath. 
“Where did Allavarg come from, 
Richie?” 

But Richie shook his head 
stubbornly, lips pressed tight. “I 
promised!” 

“Richie, a promise like that 
isn’t a good one,” pleaded Jona- 
than. “Allavarg wouldn’t want 
you to disobey your father and 
mother, would he?” 

The child sat and stared at 
him. 

This was a very disturbing 
thought and Jonathan could see 
Richie did not know how to deal 
with it. 

He pressed his momentary ad- 
vantage. “Allavarg takes care of 
little boys and girls, doesn’t he? 
He plays with them and he looks 
after them, I’ll bet.” 

Richie nodded uncertainly. 

“And,” continued Jonathan, 
smiling what he hoped was a win- 
ning, comradely smile at his son, 
“I’ll bet that Allavarg came from 
some place far, far away, didn’t 
he?” 



“Yes,” said Richie softly. 

“And it’s his job to be here 
and look after the — the nursery?” 
Jonathan bit his lip. Nursery? 
Earth? Carooms — -Martians? His 
head began to ache. “Son, you’ve 
got to help me understand. Do 
you — do you murv me?” 

R ICHIE shook his head. “No. 
But I will after — ” 

“After what?” 

“After I grow up.” 

“Why not now?” asked Jona- 
than. 

The blond head sank lower. 
“Because you framish, Daddy.” 
His father nodded, trying to 
look wise, wincing inwardly as 
he pictured his colleagues listen- 
ing in on this conversation. “Well 
— why don’t you help me so I 
don't framish?” 

“I can’t.” Richie glanced up, 
his eyes stricken. “Some day, Al- 
lavarg says, I’m going to framish, 
too!” 

“Grow up, you mean?” haz- 
arded Jonathan, and this time 
his smile was real as he looked at 
the smudged eyes and soft round 
cheeks. “Why, Richie,” he went 
on, his voice suddenly husky, 
“it’s fun to be a little boy, but 
there’ll be lots to do when you 
grow up. You — ” 

“I wish I was Mr. Easton!” 
Richie said fiercely. 

Jonathan held his breath. 
“What about Mr. Easton?” 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Richie squirmed out of the 
chair and clutched Jonathan’s 
arm. “Please, Daddy! If you let 
Mr. Easton go back, can I go, 
too? Please? Can I?” 

Jonathan put his hands on his 
son’s shoulders. “Richie! What 
do you know about Mr. Easton?” 
“Please? Can I go with him?” 
The shining blue eyes pleaded up 
at him. “If you don’t let him go 
back pretty soon, he’s going to 
framish again! Please! Can I?” 
“He’s going to framish,” nod- 
ded Jonathan. “And what then?” 
he coaxed. “What’ll happen af- 
ter he framishes? Will he be able 
to tell me about his trip?” 

“/ dunno,” said Richie. “I dun- 
no how he could. After you fra- 
mish, you don’t remember lots 
of things. I don’t think he’s even 
gonna remember he went on a 
trip.” The boy’s hands shook 
Jonathan’s arm eagerly. “Please, 
Daddy! Can I go with him?” 
“No!” Jonathan glared and re- 
leased his hold on Richie. Didn’t 
he have troubles enough without 
Richie suggesting — “About the 
nursery,” he said briskly. “Why 
is there a nursery?” 

“To take care of us.” Richie 
looked worried. “Why can’t I 

go?” 

“Because you can’t! Why don’t 
they have the nursery back 
where Allavarg came from?” 
“There isn’t any room.” The 
blue eyes studied the man, look- 



ing for a way to get permission 
to go with Mr. Easton. 

“No room? What do you 
mean?” 

Richie sighed. Obviously he’d 
have to explain first and coax 
later. “Well, you know my 
school? You know my teacher 
in school? You know when my 
teacher was different?” He peer- 
ed anxiously at Jonathan, and 
suddenly the man caught on. 

“Of. course! You mean when 
they split the kindergarten into 
two smaller groups because there 
were too many — ” 

H IS voice trailed off. Too 
many. Too many what? Too 
many Martians on Mars? Grow- 
ing population? No way to cut 
down the birth rate? He pic- 
tured the planet with too many 
people. What to do? Move out. 
Take another planet. Why didn’t 
they just do that? He put the 
question to Richie. 

“Oh,” said his son wisely, “they 
couldn’t because of the framish. 
They did go other places, but 
everywhere they went, they fra- 
mished. And after you framish, 
you ain’t — aren’t a Caroom any 
more. You’re a Gunderguck and 
of course — ” 

“Huh?” 

“ — and a Caroom doesn’t like 
to framish and be a 'Gunder- 
guck,” continued Richie happily, 
as though reciting a lesson learn -

ed in school. “He wants to be a 
Caroom all the time because it’s 
better and more fun and you 
know lots of things you don’t re- 
member after you get to be a 
Gunderguck. Only — ” he paused 
for a gulp of air — “only there 
wasn’t room for all the Carooms 
back home and they couldn’t find 
any place where they could be 
Carooms all the time, because of 
the framish. So after a long time, 
and after they looked all over all 
around, they decided maybe it 
wouldn’t be so bad if they sent 
some of their little boys and girls 
— the ones they didn’t have room 
for — to some place where they 
could be Carooms longer than 
most other places. And that 
place,” Richie said proudly, “was 
right here! ’Cause here there’s 
almost as much gladdisl as back 
home and — ” 

“Gladdisl?” Jonathan echoed 
hoarsely. “What’s — ” 

“ — and after they start grow- 
ing up — ” 

“Gladdisl,” Jonathan repeated, 
more firmly. “Richie, what is 
it?” 

The forehead puckered mo- 
mentarily. “It’s something you 
breathe, sort of.” The boy shied 
away from the difficult ques- 
tion, trying to remember what 
Allavarg had said about gladdisl. 
“Anyway, after the little boys 
and girls start to grow up and 
after they framish and be Gun- 



dergucks, like you and Mommy, 
the Carooms back home send 
some more to take their places. 
And the Gundergucks who used 
to be Carooms here in the nursery 
look after the new little — ” 

“Wait a minute! Wait a min- 
ute!” Jonathan interrupted sus- 
piciously. “I thought you said 
Allavarg looks after them.” 

“He does. But there’s so many 
little Carooms and there aren’t 
many Allavargs and so the Gun- 
dergucks have to help. You 
help,” Richie assured his father. 
“You and Mommy help a little 
bit.” 

Big of you to admit it, old 
man, thought Jonathan, sup- 
pressing a smile. “But aren’t you 
our little boy?” he asked. He 
had a sudden vision of himself 
addressing the scientists at the 
Institute: “And so, gentlemen, 
our babies — who, incidentally, 
are really Martians — are brought 
by storks, after all. Except in 
those cases where — ” 

“The doctor brought me in a 
little black bag,” said Richie. 

rpHE boy stood silent and stud- 
ied his father. He sort of re- 
membered what Allavarg had 
said, too. Things like You must- 
n’t ever tell and It’s got to be a 
secret and They’d only laugh at 
you, Richie, and if they didn’t 
laugh, they might believe you 
and % try to go back home and

there just isn't any room. 

“I think,” said Richie, “I think 
I better — ” He took a deep 
breath. “Here, Allavarg he call- 
ed in a soft, piping voice. 

Jonathan raised his head. 
“Just what do you think you’re 
doing — ” 

There was a sound behind him, 
and Jonathan turned startJedly. 

“Shame on you,” said Alla- 
varg, coming through the broken 
window. 

Jonathan’s words dropped 
away in a faint gurgle. 

“I’m sorry,” said Richie. 
“Don’t be dipplefit.” 

“It’s a mess,” Allavarg replied. 
“It’s a krandoor mess!” He waved 
his arm in the air over Jona- 
than’s head. “And don’t think 
I’m going to forget it!” The in- 
sistent hiss of escaping gas hov- 
ered over the moving pellet in 
his hand. “Jivis boy!” 

Jonathan coughed suddenly. 
He got as far as “Now look here” 
and then found that he could 
neither speak nor move. The gas 
or whatever it was stung his eyes 
and burned in his throat. 

“Why don’t you just freebie 
him?” Richie asked unhappily. 
“You’re using up all your glad- 
disl! Why don’t you freebie him 
and get me another one?” 

“Freebie, breeble,” grumbled 
Allavarg, shoving the capsule di- 
rectly under Jonathan’s nose. 
“Just like you youngsters, always 



wanting to take the easy way 
out! Gundergucks don’t grow oh 
blansercots, you know.” 

Jonathan felt tears start in 
his eyes, partly from the fumes 
and partly from a growing reali- 
zation that Allavarg was sacri- 
ficing precious air for him. Ha 
tried to think. If this was glad- 
disl and if this would keep a man 
in the state of being a Caroom, 
then — 

“There,” said Allavarg, look- 
ing unhappily at the emptied 
pellet. He shook it, sniffed it and 
finally returned it to the contain- 
er at his side. 

“I’m sorry,” Richie whispered. 
“But he kept askin’ me and ask- 
in’ me.” 

“There, there,” said Allavarg, 
going to the window. “Don’t fret. 
I know you won’t do it again.” 
He turned and looked thought- 
fully at Jonathan. He winked at 
Richie and then he was gone. 

J ONATHAN rubbed his eyes. 

He could move now. He 
opened his mouth and waggled 
his jaws. Now that the room 
was beginning to be cleared of 
the gas, he realized that it had 
had a pleasant odor. He real- 
ized — 

Why, it ‘was all so simple! Re- 
membering his sessions with Eas- 
ton, Jonathan laughed aloud. So 
simple! The message? Stay away 
from Mars! No room there! They

s aid I could come back if I gave 
you the message, but I have to 
come back alone because there’s 
no room for more people ! 

No room? Nonsense! Jonathan 
reached for the phone, dialed the 
Institute and asked for Dr. 
Stoughton. No room? On the 
paradise that was Mars? Well, 
they’d just have to make room! 
They couldn’t keep that to them- 
selves! 

“Hello, Fred?” He leaned back 
in his chair, feeling a surge of 
pride and power. Wait till they 
heard about this! “Just wanted 
to tell you I solved the Easton 
thing. Just a simple case of hap- 
sodon. You see, Allavarg came 
and gave me a tressimox of glad- 
disl and now that I’m a Caroom 
again — What? What do you 
mean, what’s the matter? I said 
I’m not a Gunderguck any 
more.” He stared at the phone. 
“Why, you spebberset moron! 
What’s the matter with you? 
Don’t you blikkel English?” 

From the depths of the big 
chair across the room, Richie 
giggled.

GALAXY SCIENCK FICTION 





rpHE month of July, when this 
column was written, was quite 
unproductive of good (or even 
bad) science fiction and fantasy. 
Three books came in, of which 
only one deserves extended men- 
tion. I shall cover these books at 
the end of this report, and mean- 
while would like to indulge in a 
bit of autobiography — and a re- 
view of a science fantasy book 
that has never been available in 
this country and has been out of 
print for many years even in 
England, where it was published 
in 1920. 

I was nostalgically searching 



through my memories during the 
July heat wave to ferret out my 
earliest contacts with science fic- 
tion. I actually did not become 
an earnest devotee of the form 
until 1944, about a year before 
the Atomic Age actually opened. 

As a matter of fact, my first 
letter to Crown Publishers, pro- 
posing what eventually became 
my first s-f. anthology, The Best 
of Science Fiction, was written on 
August 8, 1944, exactly one year 
minus one day before the drop- 
ping of an atomic bomb on Hiro- 
shima was announced. It was 
during the ensuing year that I 



★ ★★★★SHELF

spent evenings and weekends in 
the Library of Congress, browsing 
through the back files of all the 
science fiction magazines pub- 
lished to that date. 

Previous to that time, my con- 
tacts with the field had been spo- 
radic in the extreme. The first 
item I remember readftig that 
could be classed as science fiction 
was H. G. Wells’ Men Like Gods, 
back in 1924, when I was a col- 
lege sophomore. It had a tre- 
mendous effect on me, though not 
as science fiction. It provided a 
turning point in my whole ap- 
proach to philosophy and re- 
ligion, with its rationalist utopian 
world. 

From there, I went on through 
Wells’ other “science” novels, 
though, and loved them all for 
what they were, brilliant super - 
scientific adventures. 

My next dip into science fiction 
came around 1930, when I was 
sharing an apartment with a 
highly literate young man by the 
name of Frederick H. Wood. (He 
now owns and operates a fine 
book store in Bridgeport, Conn.) 

Fred was a devotee of the liter- 
ature of the imagination and had 
several bound volumes of tear- 
sheets of early weirds, fantastics 
and “scientifictions” from the old 
.Argosy, All-Story and others — 
George Allan England, Garrett 
P. Serviss, Austin Hall, Victor 
Rousseau, and, last but far from 



least, A. Merritt. 

Merritt was the man whose 
vivid imagination and writing 
ability attracted me most at the 
time, particularly The Moon Pool 
and The Face in the Abyss. These 
fine fantastic tales are nearly as 
readable today (for me, at least) 
as they were almost 25 years ago. 

But the story that made the 
greatest impression on me during 
my sojourn with Fred Wood was 
a remarkable volume called A 
Voyage to Arcturus. It was writ- 
ten by an obscure British spirit- 
ualist named David Lindsay. It 
is the only book of his I have 
ever seen, though Everett Bleiler’s 
Checklist of Fantastic Literature 
mentions three others. 

I have reread this strange book 
at least six times since, the last 
time this summer, and I can only 
report that it still has all the 
fascination for me now that it did 
when I first read it. Oddly, one 
of its most fascinating aspects is 
its almost impenetrable obscur- 
ity. Each reading left me with a 
different idea of what Lindsay 
was driving at; I still don’t really 
know. 

It is not an obscurity of lan- 
guage, but of concepts. The writ- 
ing is above average, and the 
magnificent originality and vivid- 
ness of the descriptions of an in- 
credibly different planet make the 
book immensely worth reading, 
even though one is never really

sure what it is all about. 

It commences inauspiciously 
enough, with a conventional 
“seance” in a British town house, 
the purpose of which is to ob- 
serve a medium materialize some- 
one from the “invisible world,” 
As the medium is about to com- 
mence his efforts, two strangers 
join the party. Their names are 
Maskull and Nightspore, and 
they are as forbidding as their 
names. 

The materialization proceeds 
and a young man draped in a 
shroud takes solid form in the 
room, lying on a couch. No 
sooner is he “present” than a 
third stranger breaks in unan- 
nounced. This saturnine individ- 
ual, whose name is Krag, wrings 
the neck of the materialized crea- 
ture, throwing consternation into 
the party, which naturally breaks 
up in a hurry. Maskull, Night- 
spore and Krag depart together. 

The three men go to “the fa- 
mous Starkness Observatory” on 
the northeast coast of Scotland. 
From there they are transplanted 
by Krag, in a highly improbable 
spaceship, to Tormance, the sole 
planet of the double suns of 
Arcturus. 

It is from this point on that 
the book becomes almost impos- 
sible to put down. From the evi- 
dence, Tormance is in an early 
stage of development, a world on 
which some strange force is con- 



tinuously experimenting with dif- 
ferent types of life-forms and in- 
telligences. 

Parts of the planet are highly 
unstable, with gigantic ground 
movements and changes. Others 
are coldly mountainous and 
bleak. Still others are covered 
with trees two hundred feet in 
diameter. Indeed, no part of the 
planet that Maskull, who is the 
protagonist, investigates is like 
any other part. 

Maskull goes through a series 
of strange, compulsive, dreamlike 
adventures, which nevertheless 
are vividly real despite their 
nightmarish quality. As one reads 
on, one begins to realize that the 
book is a sort of Pilgrim’s Prog- 
ress in reverse, the end of which 
is not salvation but death. 

Each adventure exemplifies 
some ethical concept: passionless 
love of beauty and self-sacrifice; 
passionate will and selfishness; 
duty and asceticism ; the “real 
world” of cause and effect; a 
“dream world” of pure, unadul- 
terated sex; and so on. Some of 
the episodes seem completely 
meaningless, yet even they are 
fascinating. 

Indeed, the book is a mystic, 
“unsane” maze of symbols, of 
abstracts made real by the de- 
monic imagination of the author. 

It is perhaps this unrelieved 
obscurity of purpose and story 
line that has kept the book al-

most unknown in the science fan- 
tasy world. Many readers may 
well wonder what the shouting 
(mine, that is) is all about. Yet 
for somber magnificence of de- 
scriptive power and for an almost 
mesmeric ability to keep the read- 
er going, whether he knows where 
or not, the book is an unforget- 
table experience, even though it 
is not really science fiction at all. 

I hope that some American 
publisher will have the daring to 
reprint it. I suspect it would sell, 
obscurity and all. 

DEEP SPACE by Eric Frank 
Russell. Fantasy Press, Inc., $3.00 

FTTHIS collection reinforces my 
long-held opinion that Eric 
Frank Russell, quietly and with- 
out much to-do, has become one 
of the very best writers of mature 
science fiction of our time. 

Of the nine novelets and short 
stories in the book, only one is, 
to my mind, poor. That is “Sec- 
ond Genesis,” the last story in 
the volume. Two or three others 
are a bit on the frothy side. 
“Homo Saps,” for instance, orig- 
inally published under the pseu- 
donym of Webster Craig, is 
hardly a momentous tale, wryly 
humbling for the human ego 
though its point is. 

But, in general, the stories 
have depth of perception and real 
maturity of viewpoint, and are 



told with all the mastery of a 
bom storyteller. 

In addition to the two men- 
tioned, the book contains “First 
Person Singular,” “The Witness,” 
“The Timid Tiger,” “Last Blast,” 
“A Little Oil,” “Rainbow’s End,” 
and the somewhat overcoinci- 
dental “The Undecided” — which 
nevertheless is a moving vision of 
how, millions of years from now, 
“all life” (not “all men”) will be 
brothers. 

None of the stories has been 
anthologized elsewhere, so that 
the book becomes an essential ad- 
dition to any library of top- 
grade science fiction. 

THE STARS ARE OURS by 
Andre Norton . World Publishing 
Co., $2.75 

1%/fTSS Norton’s third science 
-*■*-*" fiction novel for young peo- 
ple has to even greater a degree 
than the first two the merits and 
defects of her approach to the 
problem of writing for youth. 

On the asset side, she has writ- 
ten a genuinely exciting adven- 
ture. The first half deals with the 
efforts of a secret group of scien- 
tists and technicians to build and 
launch a starship in a post-atom- 
ic-war world where science is 
feared and fought, and “The 
Peacemen,” ignorant and super- 
stition-ridden dictators, rule the 
world. 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The second half tells of the 
efforts of the starship’s crew to 
establish themselves on the new 
planet of a far star to which the 
ship had taken them. It is also, 
like Miss Norton’s previous 
books, inherently a strong plea 
for peace and brotherhood among 
men. 

But the other side of the ledger 
shows an entirely unwarranted 
amount of cruelty and almost 
sadistically contrived bloodshed 
during the course of the story 
that I feel detracts considerably 
from its value. 

It is completely possible to 
write a strong and adventuresome 
anti-utopia and space -flight tale 
of tomorrow without such a fas- 
cinated emphasis on brutality, 
and I wish Miss Norton would 
learn the technique. 

The book is, frankly, a thriller, 
hard to put down. But I would 
recommend it to the young only 
with reservations. It is hardly for 
the impressionable teen-ager, any 
more than are some of the blood- 
ier comic books. 

NO TIME LIKE THE PRES - 
ENT by Nelson Bond. Avon Pub- 
lications , Inc., 35c 

T WELVE of Bond’s slick and 
somehow empty science fan- 
tasies comprise this paperback 
original, and offer the reader a 
pleasant but hardly rewarding 



couple of hours’ reading. There 
are no copyright credits, so that 
original magazine sources are un- 
revealed. Three of the tales have 
been anthologized previously, ac- 
cording to my records — which 
may well be incomplete. 

I found two of the stories of 
considerable interest: “The Last 
Outpost” and “The World of 
William Gresham.” Both deal 
with subjective visions of the fu- 
ture which may or may not 
eventually turn out to be true, 
and both are vividly horrid. 

The rest of the tales seemed to 
me to be of only passing interest.

Men or machines— something had 

to give — though not necessarily 
one or fhe other. Why not both? 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



(historian’s note: The follow- 
ing statements are extracted from 
depositions taken by the Com- 
mission of Formal Inquiry 
appointed by the Peloric Reha- 
bilitation Council, a body formed 
as a provisional government in 
the third month of the Calamity . ) 

X 

M Y name is Andrews, third 
assistant vice president 
in charge of mainten- 
ance for Cybernetic Publishers. 



It is not generally known that 
all the periodical publications for 
the world were put out by Cyber- 
netics. We did not conceal the 
monopoly deliberately, but we 
found that using the names of 
other publishing houses helped to 
give our magazines an impression 
of variety. Of course, we didn’t 
want too much variety, either; 
only the tried and tested kind. 

Cybernetics gained its mono- 
poly by cutting costs of produc- 
tion. It had succeeded in linking 
electronic calculators to photo- 



112 



GALAXY SCIINCf FICTION 




copying machines. Through this 
combination, all kinds of texts 
and illustrations could be pro- 
duced automatically. 

17'ORMULA punch cards, fed to 
the calculators, produced ar- 
ticles and stories of standard 
styles and substance. Market 
analysts in the research division 
designed the formulas for the 
punch cards. An editing machine 
shuffled the cards before giving 
them to the calculating machines. 

The shuffling produced enough 
variation in the final product to 
suggest novelty to the reader 
without actually presenting any- 
thing strange or unexpected. 

Once the cards were in the ma- 
chine, they set off electronic im- 
pulses which, by a scanning 
process, projected photographic 
images of type and illustrations 
to a ribbon of paper. This ribbon 
ran through a battery of xero- 
graphic machines to reproduce 
the exact number of copies spe- 
cified by the market indicator. 

Everything worked smoothly 
without the necessity for thought, 
which, as you know, is expensive 
and often wasteful. 

In the second week of the 
Calamity, one machine after an- 
other seemed to go out of order. 
I couldn’t tell whether the trouble 
was in the cards, in the research 
office, or in the machines. 

First, one produced something 



entitled “A Critique of the Bu- 
reaucratic Culture Pattern.” Then 
another would give out nothing 
but lyric poems. A third simply 
printed obvious gibberish, the let- 
ters F-R-E-E-D-O-M. And one 
of our oldest machines ran off a 
series of limericks of a decidedly 
pungent flavor. 

I did all I could to straighten 
them out. Even our cleaning com- 
pounds were analyzed for traces 
of alcohol. But we weren’t able 
to locate the trouble. And we 
didn’t dare shut off the power 
because that would have backed 
up our continuous stream of pulp 
and paper all the way to Canada, 
Alaska and Scandinavia. There 
didn’t seem to be anything to do 
but let the publications go on 
through to the distribution center. 

Before they were returned to 
the pulp mills, some of the pub- 
lications reached private hands 
and created something of a stir, 
especially the limericks. One of 
them went something like this: 
“There was a young . (Pas-

IVI'Y name is Minton, traffic 
officer emeritus on the Ex- 
trapolated Parkway. 

The Parkway was equipped 
with the usual electronic controls 
to propel cars magnetically, to 
maintain a safe distance between

all cars, and to hold them auto- 
matically in their proper lanes. 
The controls also turned cars off 
the Parkways at the proper exit, 
according to the settings on the 
individual automobile’s direc- 
tion-finder. 

On the ninth day of the Calam- 
ity, the controls became erratic. 
Cars ran off the highway at the 
wrong exits, even though their 
direction-finders seemed to be in 
good order. Many turned around 
in circles at entrances to the 
Parkway and failed to enter. 
Drivers abandoned cars in des- 
pair and actually made their way 
on foot. Those who remembered 
how to steer by hand, mainly 
persons with obsolete cars, were 
able to travel by using back 
country roads. It was almost 
like old times, when we used to 
have accidents. 

Meanwhile, I kept getting radio 
calls from motorists whose cars 
were trapped on the highway. 
They were unable to turn off any- 
where, even at the wrong exit. 
The magnetic propellers forced 
them to continue traveling a cir- 
cular route for hours. I don’t 
know what they expected me to 
do about it. 

They tried to say I tampered 
with the controls, but I had no 
such orders. There was nothing 
in the Traffic Officer’s Manual to 
cover this situation, so I naturally 
did nothing. 



Anyway, I think that the trou- 
ble lay with the direction-finders 
in the cars rather than with the 
Highway Controls. For several 
days previously, a great many 
cars no matter how the auto- 
matic direction-finders were set, 
had been known to head for 
water if they weren’t watched. 
Because of the fact that so many 
motorists had formed a habit of 
snoozing, once the car was in mo- 
tion, there were a number of 
drownings. If we could have done 
anything to prevent them, we 
probably would have, though 
that wasn’t our job.

M Y name is Elder, sound di- 
rector for Station 40 N 180. 
We had noticed nothing un- 
usual about our broadcasts until 
the third day of the Calamity. 
That was the first time one of our 
ultra-sensitive microphones be- 
gan to pick up and broadcast 
speeches from unknown sources. 

Our third assistant monitor 
was the first to notice. He called 
and told me that interference was 
disrupting the program. A few 
minutes later, he said that the 
sponsor’s message, as broadcast, 
did not conform to the copy 
which had been put on the tape. 
(To eliminate studio errors, all 
our broadcast programs were first 
recorded on electro-magnetic tape 



114

and edited before they were re- 
leased. 

We checked and found that 
none of the commercial messages 
were going through properly. The 
fact is that they were broadcast 
very improperly. 

I tested the microphone my- 
self and was reported as saying, 
“What difference does it make?” 
I had used the conventional test- 
ing phrases, “One, two, three, 
four,” yet all three monitors 
swore that the other sentence had 
been uttered in my voice. 

We switched at once to broad- 
casting music exclusively as an 
alternative to verbal programs, 
but the microphones continued to 
pickup vocal interference. The 
voices were of many kinds and 
not always distinct. They sound- 
ed sincere and the words were 
plain, but I could not discern any 
meaning in them. 

F OR a while, until the Calam- 
ity affected wire communi- 
cations, too, we received tele- 
phone comments from our 
audience. 

A few people complained about 
the confusion, but most asked us 
to turn off the music and let the 
voices come through clearly. 

One of the listeners said to us, 
“I haven’t heard men speak their 
minds so plainly since the morn- 
ing Grandma wrecked Grandpa’s 
new helicopter.” 



Tl/TY name is Wilson. I manned 
the remote control panel for 
the Duplicator Construction 
Company. 

As you know, we directed a 
battery of building machines 
which erected mass housing pro- 
jects. I directed only the destina- 
tion of our machines. Once I sent 
them to a site, they completed 
their work automatically with the 
materials installed at our supply 
depot. 

A single machine could pre- 
pare a site and erect a complete 
house in one day. With an army 
of 5,000 machines, our firm had 
succeeded in building as many 
houses as there was room for, 
and we had started on the demo- 
lition of our original buildings for 
replacement with the modem 
economy-size model. This made 
room for three families where one 
had lived before. We started this 
replacement program the week 
before the Calamity. 

The first hint of trouble was a 
call from a checker to the front 
office. I happened to be there 
when he appeared on the vid- 
screen and said that one of our 
machines had built a Chinese 
pagoda. He seemed to think it 
was funny. 

Then we began to receive other 
reports. Our machines were build- 
ing grape arbors, covered bridges,

One machine was not building 
at all, but had gone on a ram- 
page, clearing ground where we 
had just completed one thousand 
of the new economy-size dwelling 
units. 

The machine was dynamited 
by our emergency squad.

H/TY name is Fisher. On the first 
day of the Calamity, I was a 
member of an audience which 
had been employed by the Spec- 
tacle Commission to observe the 
start of the Forty-Ton-Shovel- 
Cross - Continent - Ditch - Digging 
Contest. 

This was the first time that 
power shovels of this size had 
been used to dig a ditch more 
than a thousand miles long. I was 
very proud to be in that audience. 

The contest started on time. 
The shovels were marshaled and 
on their marks at the city line. 
The Mayor fired a disarmed war 
rocket as the signal to start. 

And then the shovels, instead 
of biting into the dirt, turned at 
right angles and began to chew 
a path through the paid audience. 

This was not called for in the 
contract and many hired spec- 
tators ran away in fright, but a 
few of us had enough profes- 



sional pride to stand by. We 
watched as the shovels cut an 
irregular path through streets, 
parks and open lots in the city 
snapping at everything in their 
way until they reached the water- 
front. 

I thought they would stop at 
the docks. The leaders did pause, 
until all the shovels had come 
abreast. Then, as if they had a 
common impulse, they rolled into 
the harbor and sank in unison. 

As I later said to my wife, it 
was quite extraordinary. 

6 

M Y name is Danville. I was 
watching a colorvision pro- 
gram on the first day of the 
Calamity. 

The program was a wrestling 
match between a woman and a 
bear. The bear was winning when 
the screen went dark. The an- 
nouncer’s voice faded and I heard 
what sounded like the chatter of 
my neighbors. When the screen 
lit up again, it showed my own 
home. The door opened to reveal 
the hallway to the dining room, 
where I could see my wife sewing 
a patch on my son’s pants. Then 
I saw my daughter experimenting 
on fudge in the food laboratory 
and my boy working on a bomb 
model. What surprised me most 
was a picture of myself staring at 
myself on the screen.

This wasn’t very interesting to 
me, so I tried some of the other 
stations. No matter where I tuned 
in, though, I found myself look- 
ing at a part of my own home. 
I wrote a letter of complaint to 
the Universal Program Commis- 
sion, but never even got an an- 
swer. 

7 

T AM sorry that I do not re- 
member my name. I have been 
employed a long time in the 
Classified Laboratory of Theo- 
retical Physics and have been 
under security orders to speak to 
no one except in answer to official 
queries. As I am the only scholar 
in my field — the polarity of the 
positron — I have never been asked 
for information. If I had been, 
perhaps I would not have for- 
gotten my name, but I cannot 
be sure. I don’t know whether 
the replies are signed. 

I could have prevented the 
Calamity. I tried. I risked my 
life in the attempt. But at the 
moment when it seemed I might 
succeed, something happened 
which I must try to explain. 

First let me tell you why I 
knew what would happen. 

My studies of minute particles 
let me to believe that machines 
might exert some form of choice. 
Simply because aggregates have 
always behaved predictably, I 



could not assume they always 
would. Even though the masses 
of men behaved as expected, I 
remember that, in my grand- 
father’s time, individual persons 
frequently departed from estab- 
lished courses. What the individ- 
ual could do, I felt the mass or 
the machine might do. 

As you know, these were sub- 
versive views, running directly 
counter to the cult of the Statisti- 
cians, which was based entirely 
on the predictability of mass be- 
havior. 

The cult of the Statisticians 
was strong because it produced 
results. By employing Statisti- 
cians, the contending armies in 
the Peripheral Wars predicted 
each other’s movements so ac- 
curately that they eliminated the 
possibility of surprise. Thus the 
Statisticians produced the mili- 
tary impasse which destroyed the 
prestige of political leadership. 
From that time on, Statisticians 
filled the posts of government. 

The success of the Statisticians 
proved their undoing. They 
claimed that they could create a 
perfect system without conflict 
or accident. They fondly believed 
that with the feedback in the elec- 
tron brain, they could anticipate 
and correct all deviations in be- 
havior, human or mechanical. 

They might have succeeded, if 
not for a fundamental error. 

I discovered this error as soon 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




as the plans for the fiscal century 
were published. The design of the 
electron brain had completely 
ignored the polarity of the posi- 
tron. In the total fiscal complex, 
this factor permits any aggregate 
to choose its own course. But the 
error was not immediately ob- 
vious to the Statisticians. It re- 
gained subtle and concealed 
until multiplied beyond control. 

N aturally, i prepared a 

report to predict to my chiefs 
the dangers embedded in this 
plan for a perfect world. I pre- 
dicted that the machines would 
make their own derisions, even 
though most men long ago had 
lost that power. I even warned 
them that the ancient concept 
of “free will,” now forbidden, 
would return to destroy them. 
These were the facts I offered. 
The report was never delivered. 
I’d hardly put my seal on the 
document when the automatic 
security guard Closed in. The 
document was seized and I was 
bound gagged and thrown onto 
a conveyor belt. I saw myself on 
the way to the eraser. Only the 
polarity of the positron saved 
me. Desperately, on my way out 
of the laboratory, I kicked a sin- 
gle switch. 

Instead of taking me to my 
punishment, the conveyor belt 
converted itself into a joy ride. 
The gag fell out. My bonds dis- 



solved. The Calamity had begun. 

The joy ride carried me to 
witness many of the events re- 
ported to this Commission. And 
then it tossed me directly into the 
center of the office of the Chiefs. 
I had one more opportunity to 
tell my story, to save the system. 

Given a second choice, I re- 
considered. 

Had a perfect system been to 
my taste, I’d have died cheer- 
fully to save it. But the Calamity 
excited me. I relished its sur- 
prises and adventures, even its 
hazards. I remember the old 
peasant proverb, ‘‘When life is 
perfect, it is time to die.” And 
I decided I’d rather live. 

historian’s note: At this point, 
the Commission abruptly closed 
its hearings. The unnamed physi- 
cist was charged with treason and 
ordered executed on the spot. His 
life was saved, however, by Riot- 
ers representing the New Dis- 
order, which, upon seizing power, 
decreed that the Calamity should 
henceforth be called the Blessing. 

The physicist was rewarded by 
being made head of the govern- 
ment. He served two distinguished 
terms as President Nameless, 
which was the origin of the 
Presidential title of address, 
“ Your N amelessness. ,t 

The Commission, of course, 
was sent to Erasure.

“Carl!” his wife cried indig- 
nantly. “That’s a horrid thing to 
say! You must rescue her at 
once!” 

“Oh, I suppose so,” he said, 
then gave his wife a nasty little 
grin that he knew would irritate 
her. “It isn’t that she’s unattrac- 
tive, my dear, in case you hadn’t 
noticed, though she’s pretty well 
past the bloom of youth — ” 

“Will you stop making leering 
noises and go save her or not?” 

“I was coming to that. It’s just 
that she persists in using her 
Ph.D. as a club to beat men into 
respectful pulps. Men don’t like 
being beaten into respectful

woman. Now if she’d only learn-

“If you don’t stop lecturing 
and go, I will!” his wife threat- 
ened. 

“All right, all right,” he said 
wearily. “Come on, Mortland.” 

T HE two scientists slogged 
through the steamy, odorous 
jungle of Venus and soon reached 
the lizard-man, who, weighed 
down by his captive, had not 
been able to travel as fast. 

“You blast him,” the professor 
told Mortland. “Try not to hit 
Miss Anspacher, if you can man- 
age it.” 

“Er — I’ve never fired one of 
these things before,” Mortland 



said. “Can’t stand having my

goes.” He pointed his weapon at 
the lizardlike creature in a gin- 
gerly manner. “Ah — hands up,” 
he ordered. “Only fair to give 
the — well, blighter a sporting 
chance,” he explained to Profes- 
sor Bernardi. 

To their amazement, the liz-

Anspacher into the lavender-col- 
ored mud and put up his hands. 
Miss Anspacher gave an indig- 
nant yelp. 

“Seems intelligent in spite of 
the kidnaping,” Mortland com- 
mented. “But how does he hap- 
pen to understand English? 
We’re the only expedition ever 
to have reached Venus . that 
I know of, anyway.” He and the 
professor stared at each other in 
consternation. “There may have 
been a secret expedition previ- 
ously and perhaps they left a — 
a base or something, which would 
explain why — ” 

“If you two oafs would stop 
speculating, you might help me 
out of here!” Miss Anspacher re- 
marked in her customary snap- 
pish tone. Professor Bernardi 
leaped forward to obey. “You 
don’t have to pull quite so hard! 
I haven’t taken root yet!” She 
came out of the mud with a 
sound like two whales kissing. 
She brushed hopelessly at her 
once-white blouse and shorts.

“Oh, dear, I look a mess!” 

Professor Bernardi did not 
comment, being engaged in slap- 
ping at a small winged creature 
— about the size of a bluejay, but 
looking like a cross between a 
bat and a mosquito — that seemed 
interested in taking a bite out of 
him. It escaped his flapping hand 
and flew to the top of Mortland’s 
sun helmet, where it glared at 
the professor. 

“Since you seem to understand 
English,” Miss Anspacher said to 
the lizard-man through a mouth- 
ful of hairpins, “perhaps you will 
be so kind as to explain the 
meaning of this outrage?” 

“I was smitten,” the alien re- 
plied suavely. “Passion made me 
forget myself.” 

Professor Bernardi looked 
thoughtfully at him. “A prior 
expedition isn’t the answer. It 
wouldn’t have troubled to edu- 
cate you so thoroughly. There- 
fore, the explanation is that you 
pick up English by reading our 
minds. Correct?” 

The lizard-man turned an em- 
barrassed olive. “Yes.” 

N OW that he was able to give 
the creature a more thor- 
ough inspection, Bernardi saw 
that he really didn’t look too 
much like a lizard. He definitely 
appeared to be wearing clothes 
of some kind, which, in the Ve- 
nusian heat, indicated a particu- 



larly refined degree of civilization 
— unless, of course, the squamous 
skin protected him from the heat 
as well as the humidity. 

More than that, though, he 
was humanoid in almost a Hol- 
lywood way. He had a particu- 
larly fine profile and an athletic 
physique, which, oddly, his 
scales seemed to enhance, much 
like a movie idol dressed in fine- 
meshed Medieval armor. Natu- 
rally, he had a tail, but it was 
as well proportioned as a kan- 
garoo’s, though shorter and more 
graceful, and it struck Professor 
Bernardi as a particularly hand- 
some and useful gadget. 

For one thing, the people from 
Earth were standing uncomfort- 
ably in the slippery mud, while 
the lizard-man was using his tail 
much in the fashion of a specta- 
tor stool, leaning back against it 
almost in a sitting position, with 
his armor-shod feet supporting 
him comfortably. For another, 
the tail undoubtedly served for 
balance and the added push of 
a walking stick and perhaps for 
swift attack or getaway. Very 
practical and attractive, the pro- 
fessor concluded — too bad Man 
had relinquished his tail when 
climbing down from the trees. 

“Thank you,” the saurian said 
with uneasy modesty, looking at 
him. “Good of you to think so. 
You are a fairly intelligent spe- 
cies, aren’t you?”

“Fairly/* the professor ac- 
knowledged, preoccupied with a 
clever idea. Perhaps existence on 
Venus wasn’t going to be as un- 
pleasant as he had anticipated. 
“From reading my mind, you 
know what this blaster can do, 
don’t you?” 

“I’m afraid so.” 

“Then you know what I ex- 
pect of you?” 

“Yes, sahib. I’se cornin’, mas- 
sa. To hear is to obey, effendi.” 
The creature turned and went 
briskly back toward the camp, 
leaving the others to stumble af- 
ter him. 

Mrs. Bernardi gave a shriek as 
his handsome scaled form emerg- 
ed from the greenish-white un- 
derbrush, haloed in luminous yel- 
low mist. Algol, the ship’s cat, 
prudently took sanctuary behind 
her, then peered out to see what 
was going on and whether there 
was likely to be anything in it 
for him. 

“This is our native bearer,” 
Professor Bernardi explained as 
the three scientists burst out of 
the jungle. 

“My name is Jrann-Pttt.” The 
creature bowed low. “At your 
service, madame.” 

“Oh, Carl!” Mrs. Bernardi 
clapped her hands. “He’s just 
perfect! So thoughtful of you to 
find one that speaks English! I 
do hope you can cook, Pitt?” 

“I will do my best, madame.” 



A LGOL daintily picked his 
way through the mud to- 
ward the saurian, sniffed him 
with judicial deliberation; then, 
deciding that anyone who smell- 
ed so much like the better class 
of fish must be All Right, rubbed 
against his legs. 

“Well,” remarked Miss Ans- 
pacher, using the side of the 
spaceship as a mirror by which 
to redden her somewhat prissy 
lips, “that makes it practically 
unanimous, doesn’t it?” 

“All except Professor Ber- 
nardi,” said Jrann-Pttt, looking 
at the scientist with what might 
have been a smile. “He doesn’t 
like me.” 

“I see that your telepathic 
powers are not quite accurate,” 
the professor returned. “I do not 
dislike you; I distrust you.” 
“The fact that the two terms 
are not entirely synonymous in 
your language would argue a cer- 
tain degree of incipient civiliza- 
tion,” the lizard-man observed. 

“You know, Carl,” Mrs. Ber- 
nardi whispered, “he has an aw- 
fully funny way of talking, for 
a native.” 

“Frankly I don’t like this at 
all, Professor,” Captain Green- 
field said, mopping his brow with 
a limp handkerchief. “If I hadn’t 
been off looking for a better 
berth for the ship — all this mud 
worries me — this’d never have 
- happened.”

“You mean you would have 
let the lizard get away with Miss 
Anspacher?” 

The big man’s face flushed 
crimson. “I don’t think that’s 
funny, Professor.” 

Bernardi quickly changed the 
subject, for he realized that the 
captain, being by far the most 
muscular of the party, was not 
a man to trifle with. “Tell me, 
Greenfield, did you succeed in 
finding a better spot for the ship? 
I must admit I’m worried about 
that mud myself.” 

“Only remotely dry spot 
around is an outcropping ’bout 
two kilometers away,” Greenfield 
said grudgingly. He shifted his 
camp stool in a futile search for 
shade. Even though the sun 
never penetrated the thick layer 
of clouds, the yellow light dif- 
fused through them was blind- 
ing. “Might be big enough, but 
it’s not level. Could blast it 
smooth, but that’d take at least 
a week — Earth time.” 

Bernardi pulled his damp shirt 
away from his body. “Well, I 
daresay we’ll be all right where 
we are, if we’re not assailed by 
any violent forces of nature. On 
Earth, this might be a monsoon 
climate.” 

“If you ask m$, that monster 
is more of a danger than any 
monsoon.” 

Bernardi sighed. Although by 
far the most competent officer 

COLLECTOR'S ITEM 



available for the job of space- 
ship captain, Greenfield was not 
quite the man he would have 
chosen to be his associate for 
months on end. Still, beggars — 
as Miss Anspacher might have 
eloquently put it — could not be 
choosers. “What makes' you say 
that?” he asked, trying to set an 
example of tolerance. 

“Don’t like the idea of him 
cooking for us,” the captain said 
stubbornly. “Might poison us all 
in our beds.” 

“Well, don’t eat in your bed,” 
suggested Mortland, strolling out 
of the airlock in the company of 
the cat. Algol, however, finding 
that the spot beside the captain’s 
camp stool was as dry as any- 
thing could be on Venus, de- 
cided to turn back. 

“fTiHE difficulty is easily over- 
come, Captain,” the profes- 
sor said, still holding on to his 
patience. “You can continue to 
cook your own meals from the 
tinned and packaged foods on 
board ship. The rest of us will 
eat fresh native foods prepared 
by Jrann-Pttt.” 

“But why,” Miss Anspacher 
interrupted as she emerged from 
the airlock with a large cast-iron 
skillet, “should you think Jrann- 
Pttt wants to poison us?” 

Both men rose from their 
stools. “Stands to reason he’d 
consider us his enemies, Miss 

127 




Anspacher,” the captain said. 
“After all, we — as a group, that 
is — captured him.” 

“Hired him,” Professor Ber- 
nardi contradicted. “I’ve tele- 
pathically arranged to pay him 
an adequate salary. In goods, of 
course; I don’t suppose our mon- 
ey would be of much use to 
him. And I think he's rather glad 
of the chance to hang around and 
observe us conveniently.” 

“Observe us!” Greenfield ex- 
claimed. “You mean he’s spying 
out the land for an attack? Let’s 
prepare our defenses at once!” 
“I doubt if that’s what he has 
in mind,” Professor Bernardi 
said judiciously. 

“He may be staying because 
he wants to be near me,” Miss 
Anspacher blurted. Overcome by 
this unmaidenly admission, she 
reddened and rushed from them, 
calling, “Yoo-hoo, Jrann-Pttt! 
Here is the frying pan!” Algol 
woke up instantly and followed 
her. “Frying” was one of the 
more important words in his vo- 
cabulary. 

Captain Greenfield stared 
across the clearing after them, 
then turned back to Bernardi 
with a frown. “I don’t like to 
see one of our girls mixed up 
with a lizard — and a foreign liz- 
ard at that.” But his face too 
clearly betrayed a personal re- 
sentment. 

“Don’t tell me you have a — a 



fondness for Miss Anspacher, 
Captain,” Professor Bernardi ex- 
claimed, genuinely surprised. Un- 
deniably Miss Anspacher — al- 
though no longer in her first 
youth — was a handsome woman, 
but he would not have expected 
her somewhat cerebral type to 
appeal to the captain. On the 
other hand, she was the only un- 
attached woman in the party and 
they were a long way from home. 

Greenfield picked a fleck of 
dried violet mud from the side 
of the ship and avoided Ber- 
nardi’s eye. “One of the reasons 
I came along,” he said almost 
bashfully. “Thought I’d have the 
chance to be alone with her now 
and again and impress her with, 
with. 

“Your sterling qualities?” Ber- 
nardi suggested. 

The 1 captain flashed him a 
glance of mingled gratitude and 
resentment. “And now this damn- 
ed lizard has to come along!” 

“Cheer up, Captain,” said the 
professor. “I’ll back you against 
a lizard any time.” 

A LTHOUGH the long twilight 
of Venus had deepened into 
night and it could never really 
be cool there by terrestrial stand- 
ards, the temperature was almost 
comfortable. Everything was 
quite black, except for the pallid 
purple campfire glowing through 
the darkness; the clouds that 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




perpetually covered the surface 
of the planet prevented even the 
light of the stars from reaching it. 

“Tell me more about the cross- 
versus the parallel-cousin rela- 
tionships in your culture, Jrann- 
Pttt,” Miss Anspacher breathed, 
wriggling her camp stool closer 
to the saurian’s. “Anthropology 
is a great hobby of mine, you 
know. How do your people feel 
about exogamy?” 

“I’m afraid I’m rather exhaust- 
ed, dear lady,” he said, using one 
arm to mask a yawn, and one to 
surreptitiously wave away the 
saurian head that was peering 
out of the underbrush. “I should- 
n’t like to give a scientist like 
yourself any misinformation that 
might become a matter of rec- 
ord.” 

“Of course not,” she murmur- 
ed. “You’re so considerate.” 

A pale face appeared in the 
firelight like some weird 
creature of darkness. Terrestrial 
and extraterrestrial both started. 
“Miss Anspacher,” the captain 
growled, “I’d like to lock up the 
ship, so if you wouldn’t mind 
turning in — ” 

Miss Anspacher pouted. 
“You’ve interrupted such an in- 
teresting conversation. And I 
don’t see why you have to lock 
up the ship. After all, the night 
is three hundred and eighty-five 
hours long. We don’t sleep all 



that time and it would be a 
shame to be cooped up.” 

“I’m going to try to rig up 
some floodlights,” Greenfield ex- 
plained stiffly, “so we won’t be 
caught like this again. Nobody 
bothered to tell me the day equals 
thirty-two of ours, so that half 
of it would be night.” 

“Then I won’t see you for al- 
most two weeks of our time, 
Jrann-Pttt? Are you sure you 
wouldn’t like to spend the rest 
of the night in our ship? Plenty 
of room, you know.” 

“No, thank you, dear lady. 
The jungle is my natural habi- 
tat. I should feel stultified by 
walls and a ceiling. Don’t worry 
— I shan’t run away.” 

“Oh, I’m not worried,” Miss 
Anspacher said coyly, throwing 
a stick of wood on the fire. 
“Small riddance if he does.” 
“Captain Greenfield!” 

That part of the captain’s face 
not concealed by his piratical 
black beard turned red. “Well, 
if he can read our minds, he 
knows damn well what I’m think- 
ing, anyway, so why be hypo- 
critical about it?” 

“That’s right — he is a telepath, 
isn’t he?” Miss Anspacher’s face 
grew even redder than the cap- 
tain’s. “I forgot he. It is get- 
ting late. I really must go. Good 
night, Jrann-Pttt.” 

“Good night, dear lady.” The 
saurian bowed low over her hand.

Leaning on the captain’s braw- 
ny arm, Miss Anspacher plough- 
ed through the mud to the ship, 
followed by the mosquito-bat 
and Algol, who had been toasting 
themselves more or less compan- 
ionably at the fire. The door to 
the airlock clanged behind all 
four of them. 

PT1HE other saurian’s head ap- 
peared again from the bush. 
Jrann-Pttt, the insistent thought 
came, shall I rescue you now? 

Why, Dfar-Lll? 1 am not a 
prisoner. I'm quite free to come 
and go as I please. But let's get 
away from the strangers' ship 
while we communicate. They do 
have a certain amount of low- 
grade perception and might be 
able to sense the presence of an- 
other personality. At any rate, 
they might look out of a port 
and see you. 

Keeping the illuminator on 
low beam, Dfar-Lll led the way 
through the bushes. Seems to me 
you’re going to an awful lot of 
trouble just to get zoo speci- 
mens, the youngster protested, 
disentangling its arms from the 
embrace of an amorous vine. 
There’s really no reason for car- 
rying on the work since Lieuten- 
ant Merglyt-Ruuu . passed on. 

Jrann-Pttt sat down on a fall- 
en log and, tucking up his grace- 
ful tail, signaled his junior to 
join him. In the event that we 



do decide to return to base, some 
handsome specimens might serve 
to offset the lieutenant’s demise. 

Return to base? But I thought 
we were ... 

We haven’t found swamp life 
pleasant, have we? After all, 
there’s no real reason why we 
shouldn’t go back. Is it our fault 
that Merglyt-Ruuu happened to 
meet with a fatal accident? 

We-ell . but will the com- 
mandant see it that way? 

On the other hand, if we don't 
go back, wouldn't it be a good 
idea to attach ourselves to an 
expedition that, no matter how 
alien, is better equipped for sur- 
vival than we? And carrying out 
our original purpose seemed the 
best way of getting to meet these 
strangers informally, as it were. 

They are unquestionably intel- 
ligent life-forms then? 

After a fashion. Jrann-Pttt 
yawned and rose. But why are 
we sitting here? Let's start back 
to our camp. We will be able to 
converse more, comfortably. 

They made their way through 
the jungle — now walking, now 
wading where the mud became 
water. Small creatures with hard- 
ly any thoughts scurried before 
them as they went. 

The commandant may have 
already made contact with their 
rulers, Dfar-Lll suggested, spring- 
ing forward to illuminate the 
way. In that case, we couldn’t 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




hope to remain undiscovered for 
long. 

Oh, these creatures are not Ve- 
nusians. There’s no intelligent life 
here. They hail from the third 
planet of this system and, ac- 
cording to their thoughts, this is 
the only vessel that was ca- 
pable of traversing interplanetary 
space. So we needn’t worry about 
extradition treaties or any other 
official annoyance s. 

If they’re friendly, why didn't 
you spend the night in their ship? 
It certainly looks more comfort- 
able than our collapsible moslak 
— which, by the way, collapsed 
while you were gone. I hope we’ll 
be able to put it up again our- 
selves. I must say this for the 
lieutenant — he was good at that 
sort of thing. 

Jrann-Pttt made a gesture of 
distaste. He was unfortunately 
good at other things, too. But 
let’s not discuss him. I’m not 
staying with the strangers be- 
cause I want to pick up one or 
two little, things — mostly some of 
our food to serve them. I used 
up all the supplies in my pack 
and I want them to think we’re 
living off the land. They believe 
me to be a primitive and it's best 
that they should until I decide 
just how I’m going to make most 
efficient use of them. Besides, I 
didn’t want to leave you alone. 

The younger saurian sniffed 
skeptically. 



“TT° NESTL Y, Pitt,” Mrs. Ber- 
nardi said, keeping to lee- 
ward of the tablecloth the lizard - 
man was efficiently shaking out 
of the airlock, “I’ve never had a 
—an employee as competent as 
you.” But the word she had in 
mind, of course, was “servant.” 
“I do wish you’d come back to 
Earth with us.” 

“Perhaps you would compel 
me to come?” he suggested, as 
Algol and the mosquito-bat en- 
tered into hot competition to 
catch the crumbs before they 
sank into the purple ooze. 

“Oh, no! We’d want you to 
come as our guest — our friend.” 
Naturally, her thoughts ran, a 
house guest would be expected 
to help with the washing up and 
lend a hand with the cooking — 
and, of course, we wouldn’t have 
to pay him. Though my hus- 
band, I suppose, would requisi- 
tion him as a specimen. 

I fully intend to go to Earth 
with them, Jrann-Pttt mused, but 
certainly not in that capacity. 
Nor would I care to be a speci- 
men. I must formulate some con- 
crete plan. 

The captain was crawling on 
top of the spaceship, scraping off 
the dried mud, brushing away 
the leaves and dust that marred 
its shining purity. The hot, hu- 
mid haze that poured down from 
the yellow clouds made the metal 
surface a little hell. Yet it was

hardly less warm on the other 
side of the clearing, where Miss 
Anspacher tried desperately to 
write up her notes on a table 
that kept sinking into the spongy 
ground, and hindered by the 
thick wind that had arisen half 
an hour before and which kept 
blowing her* papers off. The sweet 
odor of the flowers tucked in the 
open neck of her already grimy 
white blouse suddenly sickened 
her and she flung them into the 
mud. 

“We won’t be going back to 
Earth for a long time!” she call- 
ed. Gathering up the purple - 
stained papers, she came toward 
the others, little puffs of mist 
rising at each step. “We like it 
here. Lovely country.” 

How could she think to please 
even the savage she fancied him 
to be by such an inanity, Jrann- 
Pttt wondered. No one could pos- 
sibly like that fetid swamp. Or 
was it not so much that she was 
trying to please him as convince 
herself? Was there some reason 
the terrestrials had for needing 
to like Venus. It hovered on the 
edge of the women’s minds. If 
only it would emerge completely, 
he could pick it up, but it lurked 
in the shadows of their subcon- 
scious, tantalizing him. 

“I’d like to know when we’re 
going to start putting up the 
shelters,” Mrs. Bernardi said, 
pushing a streak of fog-yellow 



hair out of her eyes. “I can't 
stand being cooped up for an- 
other night on that ship.” 

“You’re planning to put up 
shelters — to live outside of the 
ship?” This would seem to con- 
firm his darkest suspicions. Even 
a temporary settlement would 
leave them too open to visita- 
tion from the commandant. What 
his attitude toward the aliens 
might be, Jrann-Pttt didn’t 
know. He might consider them 
as specimens, as enemies or as 
potential allies. What his atti- 
tude toward Jrann-Pttt and his 
companion would be, however, 
the saurian knew only too well. 
Had they reported the lieuten- 
ant’s demise immediately, it was 
possible the commandant might 
have been brought to believe it 
was an accident. Now he would 
unquestionably think Jrann-Pttt 
had killed Merglyt-Ruuu on pur- 
pose — which was not true; how 
was Jrann-Pttt to know that the 
mud into which he’d knocked the 
lieutenant was quicksand? 

“Anything against putting up 
shelters?” Captain Greenfield 
growled from his perch. 

“Monster!” the mosquito-bat 
shrieked at the cat. “Monster! 
Monster!” 

T HERE was a painfully em- 
barrassed silence. 

“The creature is not intelli- 
gent/' Jrann-Pttt explained, 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




smiling. “It merely has vocal 
apparatus that can reproduce a 
frequently heard word, like — you 
have a bird, I believe, a — ” he 
searched their minds for the word 
— a parrot.” 

“Monster!” the mosquito-bat 
continued. “Monster! Monster!” 
“Shut up or I’ll wring your 
neck!” the captain snarled. The 
mosquito-bat obeyed sullenly, 
apparently recognizing the threat 
in his tone. 

But the concept of “monster” 
hung heavily in the air between 
the terrestrials and the lizard- 
man. They should not feel so bad 
about it, he thought, for they are 
the monsters themselves. But that 
would never occur to them and 
I can hardly reassure them by 
saying . 

“Don’t worry,” Professor Ber- 
nardi saic} smoothly. “To him, 
it’s we who are the monsters.” ' 
A sudden gust of wind nearly 
whipped the tablecloth out of 
Jrann-Pttt’s hands. He fought 
with it for a moment, glad of 
something tangible to contend 
with. “About the shelters,” he 
said. “They might not stand up 
against a storm.” 

“So this is monsoon country,” 
Bernardi observed thoughtfully. 
“Do you know when the storms 
usually come, Jrann-Pttt?” The 
other shook his head. “Peculiar. 
There usually is a season for 
that sort of thing.” 



“I . come from another part 
of the planet.” 

“Storms here are bad, eh?” the 
captain commented, swinging 
himself down easily. “Frankly, 
that worries me. Ship’s resting on 
mud as far as I can see, and if 
there’s one thing I do know some- 
thing about, it’s mud. If it got any 
wetter, the ship might sink.” 
“Maybe we should leave,” 
Mrs. Bernardi suggested. “Go to 
another part of the planet where 
it’s drier, or — ” she tried not to 
show the sudden surge of hope 
— “leave for home and come back 
after the rainy season.” 

There was a sudden silence, 
and Jrann-Pttt found himself 
able to pick up the answers to 
some of his questions from the 
alien minds. His worst fears 
were confirmed. Plan A was out. 
But something could still be done 
with these creatures. 

“Doesn’t she know?” the cap- 
tain demanded accusingly. “You 
brought her here without telling 
her?” 

Bernardi spread his hands wide 
in a futile gesture. “She should 
know; I’ve told her repeatedly. 
She just doesn’t understand . 
or doesn’t want to.” 

“I know they’ll forgive us,” 
Mrs. Bernardi said stubbornly. 
“We — you — haven’t done any- 
thing really wrong, so how could 
they do anything terrible to us? 
After all, didn’t they refuse you

the funds because they said you 
couldn’t — ” 

“Shhh, Louisa,” her husband 
commanded. 

Jrann-Pttt smiled to himself. 

— “do it,” she went on. “And 
you did. So they were wrong and 
they'll have to forgive us.” 

“Tchaf” Miss Anspacher said. 
“Since when was there any fair- 
ness in justice?” 

“iT\N the other hand,” Mrs. 

” Bernardi continued, “we 
have no idea of how dangerous 
the storms here could be.” 

“Very dangerous,” Jrann-Pttt 
said. 

“For you, perhaps,” the cap- 
tain retorted. “Maybe not for 
us.” 

“Now that’s silly,” Miss Ans- 
pacher said. “You can see that 
Jrann-Pttt is much more — ” she 
blushed — “sturdily built than 
we are.” 

“I don’t mean that we could 
face it without protection,” the 
captain replied angrily. “Natu- 
rally I mean that our superior 
technology could cope with the 
effects of any storm.” 

“Well, Captain, we’ll have to 
put that superior technology to 
use at once,” the professor told 
him. “You’d better start blasting 
that rock.” 

Laden with equipment and 
malevolent thoughts, the captain 
trudged off into the murky jun- 



gle. The others would not even 
offer to help. Confounded scien- 
tists; they certainly took his sta- 
tus as captain seriously. He 
wished, for a disloyal moment, 
that he had -stayed on Earth. 
The quiet routine of a test pilot 
had prepared him for nothing 
like this. Were Miss Anspacher 
and adventure worth it? At the 
moment, he thought not. But he 
was on Venus and it was too late 
to change his mind. 

Jrann-Pttt followed him into 
the jungle, keeping some distance 
behind, for he had good reason 
to suspect that Greenfield would 
take his warm interest in terres- 
trial technology for plain spying. 
Or, worse yet, he might try to 
press the lizard-man into service; 
Jrann-Pttt felt he had demeaned 
himself quite enough already. 

“Have you noticed,” Miss Ans- 
pacher asked, pushing the mass 
of damp brown hair off her neck 
as she came alongside him, “how 
the — the smell — ” a scientist does 
not mince words — “of the swamp 
has grown stronger?” 

Jrann-Pttt halted. He had a 
good idea of what the captain’s 
reactions to the sight of himself 
and Miss Anspacher arriving 
hand-in-hand would be. “Yes, it 
is getting rather overpowering. 
Perhaps, for a lady of your deli- 
cate sensibilities, it would be 
best to — ” 

“I can stand a bad smell just

as well as a male — any male!” 

“Perhaps even better,” Jrann- 
Pttt said, “for I was on the verge 
of turning back myself.” 

“Oh,” she said, appeased. 
“Well, in that case, I’ll go back 
with you . how quiet every- 
thing is!” 

TTE had not noticed. For him, 
it would never be quiet be- 
cause of the stream of jangled 
thoughts constantly pouring into 
the back of his mind from every- 
thing sentient that surrounded 
him. 

For a moment, he wondered 
what it would be like to be non- 
telepathic like the terrestrials, to 
have peace from the clamor of 
confused impressions, emotions 
and ideas that persistently beat 
at his mind. But that would be 
wondering how it was to be deaf 
to avoid discord, or blind to shut 
out ugliness. 

“The lull before the storm, I 
suppose,” she said brightly. Now 
is his opportunity to kiss me — 
only perhaps they don’t have 
kissing in his society. His mouth 
does seem to be the wrong shape. 
And if I kissed him, it might vio- 
late a taboo. 

During their short absence, the 
citrine clouds that closed off the 
sky had changed to a sinister 
umber. It was now almost as 
dusky in the clearing as in the 
jungle itself, when Jrann-Pttt and 



Miss Anspacher returned and 
joined the others. 

Professor Bernardi stood look- 
ing up with sharp gray eyes at 
a sky he could not see. “I hope 
Greenfield can finish the blast- 
ing more quickly than he esti- 
mated,” he muttered. 

“Will we hear the noise way 
out here, Carl?” his wife worried 
nervously. 

“Only two kilometers away? 
Of course we’ll hear it. I do wish 
you wouldn’t always be asking 
such stupid questions.” 

She shivered. “Well, I hope 
they get it over with right away. 
If we just have to sit here wait- 
ing and waiting and waiting, I’ll 
go mad. I know I will.” 

“You should try to keep your 
nerves in check, Louisa,” Miss 
Anspacher snapped. Silly little 
fool. 

“At least I can control my 
glands!” Mrs. Bernardi flared 
back. Sex-starved spinster. 

“I shall make some tea, la- 
dies,” Jrann-Pttt interposed. “I’m 
sure we will all feel the better 
for it.” 

Mrs. Bernardi smiled at him 
feebly. “You’re such a comfort, 
Pitt. I don’t know why you of 
all creatures should be the one 
to remind me of home.” 

“Home,” remarked Mortland, 
emerging from the airlock, “is 
where the heart is. Did I hear 
someone say ‘tea’?”

A S Jrann-Pttt hung the kettle 
over the fire, suddenly the 
air erupted in stunning violence 
of sound. The ground undulated 
under their feet and water slop- 
ped out of the kettle, almost put- 
ting out the fire that rose high 
to claw at it. Rivulets of thick, 
muddy liquid welled out of the 
ground and drabbled their feet. 
The women turned pale. Algol 
gave a faint cry and hid under 
Mrs. Bernardi’s skirts, trembling, 
while the mosquito-bat tried to 
lift Mortland’s toupee and hide 
in his hair. The ship itself quiv- 
ered and seemed to jump slight- 
ly in the air, then returned to 
its resting place. 

All was quiet again, quieter 
than it had been before. Mort- 
land anxiously gnawed his light 
mustache. “Better hurry with 
that tea, there’s a good fellow. 
I’m violently allergic to loud 
noises.” 

“They’ll probably continue all 
day,” the professor said with al- 
most malevolent cheerfulness, “so 
you might as well get used to 
them.” Who is he to have nerves? 
I am easily the most sensitive 
person here, but I manage to con- 
trol myself. 

“I don’t know how I’m going 
to stand it!” Mrs. Bernardi 
shrieked. “I just know something 
terrible is going to happen.” 
“Please try to restrain your- 
self, Louisa,” her husband order- 



ed. “After it’s over, you’ll find 
we’ll be much more comfortable 
and secure with the ship resting 
on rock.” 

“If you ask me, that blast made 
it sink a little,” Mortland said. 
“I wonder whether — 

He was interrupted by a 
thrashing in the bushes. Dfar-Lll 
burst forth, shedding scales. Do 
not despair, Jrann-Pttt. I am 
here, ready to save you or die 
at your side. 

The women clutched each 
other. Miss Anspacher praying 
silently and fervently to Juno, 
Lakshmi, Freya, Isis and a host 
of other esoteric female deities 
she had picked up in the course 
of her avocational researches. 

“He seems to be one of Jrann- 
Pttt’s people,” Bernardi observ- 
ed, “so there should be nothing 
to fear.” 

Dfar-Lll , you fool ! Jrann-Pttt 
ideated angrily. Nothing’s wrong. 
They're just blasting out a bet- 
ter berth for their vessel. And 
now you’ve spoiled my plans. 

“What did you think at that 
poor little creature!” Mrs. Ber- 
nardi blazed. “He’s crying!” And, 
sure enough, amethyst tears 
were oozing out of the young 
saurian’s large, liquid eyes. 

I du-didn’t mean any harm. 

“Monster!” Mrs. Bernardi ac- 
cused Jrann-Pttt. “All men are 
monsters, whether they’re aliens 
or not.”

“You’re so right, Louisa!” 
Miss Anspacher exclaimed, re- 
garding the younger creature in 
an almost kindly manner. 

Fm sorry, r-Lll, Jrann-Pttt 
apologized. I was upset by that 
noise, too. How could you pos- 
sibly know what it was? Come, 
let me introduce you to the crea- 
tures. 

D FAR-LLL stepped forward 
diffidently. Jrann-Pttt put a 
hand on the moss -green shoul- 
der. “Allow me to introduce my 
companion, Dfar-Lll,” he said 
aloud. 

The youngster looked at him. 
Mrs. Bernardi thrust out her 
hand. “I’m very glad to meet 
you, Lil.” 

Agitate it with one of yours. 
It’s a courtesy. Don’t let her see 
how repulsive she is to you. Re- 
member, you’re just as repulsive 
to her. 

Dfar-Lll offered a shy, seven- 
fingered hand. “Pleased ... to 
meet you . ma’am,” the young 
lizard squeaked. 

“Why, he’s just a baby, isn’t 
he?” Mrs. Bernardi asked. 

I am^not a baby! Dfar-Lll 
thought indignantly. At the end 
of this year, I shall celebrate my 
pre-maturity feast, or I would 
have. And furthermore — 

There was another thunderous 
blast of sound. After the ground 
had stopped trembling, the six 



found themselves ankle-deep in 
muddy water. Algol, who was in 
considerably deeper than his an- 
kles, mewed fretfully. Mrs. Ber- 
nardi picked him up and com- 
forted him. 

“Perhaps blasting wasn’t such 
a good idea,” the professor mut- 
tered. “Maybe I should tell 
Greenfield to call a halt and 
we’ll take our chances with the 
storm. As a matter of fa — ” 
“The ship!” Mortland cried. 
“It is sinking!” 

And the big metal ball slowly 
but visibly was indeed subsiding 
into the mud. 

“Stop it, somebody!” Miss 
Anspacher snapped in her cus- 
tomary schoolroom manner. 

The professor was pale, but he 
held on to his calm. “What can 
we do? Even if we could get the 
captain back in time, there’s no 
way we can stop it. It’s too heavy 
to pull out manually, and the 
engines, of course, are inside.” 

As they watched in horror, the 
ship sank deeper and deeper, 
picking up momentum as more 
of it went under. With a loud, 
sucking sound, it vanished into 
the ooze. Muddy water gurgled 
over it and, where the ship had 
been, there was now a small lake. 

“This could be the beginning 
of a legend,” Miss Anspacher 
murmured. “Or the end.” 

There was another vibrant de- 
tonation. “Someone ought to go

tell the captain there’s no use 
blasting any more,” Bernardi 
said wearily. “We have nothing 
to put on the rock when he 
smooths it off.” He began to 
laugh. “I suppose you could call 
this poetic justice.” And he went 
on laughing, losing a bit of his 
former self-control. 

There goes Plan B, Jrann-Pttt 
thought. 

A star of intensely bright green 
lightning split the clouds and 
widened to cover the visible ex- 
panse of sky. There was a planet- 
shaking clap of thunder that 
made Greenfield’s puny efforts 
sound like the snapping of twigs 
in comparison and it began to 
rain hard and fast. 

“TF only I hadn’t gone and 
blasted that damn rock,” the 
captain grumbled, squeezing wa- 
ter out of his shirt-tails, “we’d 
have been all right. Probably the 
storm wouldn’t have done a thing 
to the ship except get it wet. If 
you can even call it a storm.” 

“I can and I do,” Jrann-Pttt 
replied, haughtily squeegeeing his 
wet scales. “All I said was that 
a storm might be coming up and 
it might be dangerous. How was 
I to know it would last only half 
an hour?” 

“Even the camp stools pulled 
through,” Greenfield pointed 
out, “and you said shelters 
wouldn’t stand up.” 



“I only said they might not 
Can’t you understand your own, 
language?” 

The fissure in the clouds had 
not quite closed yet and through 
it the enormous, blazing disk of 
the sun glared at them, twice as 
large as it appeared from Earth. 
It was a moot point as to whe- 
ther they’d be dried out or steam- 
ed alive first. 

“Might as well collect what- 
ever gear we have left and get it 
to higher ground,” Miss Ans- 
pacher said efficiently. “Two feet 
of water won’t do anything any 
good — even those camp stools.” 

“It’s my belief you wanted this 
to happen,” Greenfield accused 
Jrann-Pttt. “You wanted to get 
rid of us.” 

“My dear fellow,” Jrann-Pttt 
replied loftily, “the information 
I gave you was, to the best of my 
knowledge, accurate. However, I 
happen to be a professor of zo- 
ology and not a meteorologist. 
Apparently you people live out 
in the open like primitives,” he 
continued, ignoring Dfar-Lll’s ad- 
miring interjection, “and are ac- 
customed to the vicissitudes of 
weather. I am a 'civilized crea- 
ture; I live — ” or used to live 
— “in an air-conditioned, light- 
conditioned, weather-conditioned 
city. It is only when I rough it 
on field trips like this to track- 
less parts of the — globe that I 
am forced to experience weather.

Even then, I have never before 
been caught in a situation like 
this.” 

In fact, I was never before 
caught or I wouldn't be in this 
situation at all. 

“Oh, Jrann-Pttt,” sighed Miss 
Anspacher, “I knew you couldn’t 
be just an ordinary native!” 
“How did you get into this 
situation then?” Professor Ber- 
nardi asked. He had an unfortu- 
nate talent for going directly to 
the point. 

“The third member of our ex- 
pedition died,” Jrann-Pttt ex- 
plained. “He was our dirigational 
expert. Our guide.” 

“How did he happen to — ” 
“Are we just going to stand 
here chatting,” Miss Anspacher 
demanded, “or are we going to 
do something about this?” 

“What can we do?” Mrs. Ber- 
nard! asked weakly. “We might 
just as well lie down and — ” 
“Never say die, Louisa,” Miss 
Anspacher admonished. 

“I suggest we go to my camp 
to see what shape it’s in,” Jrann- 
Pttt said, furiously putting to- 
gether Plan C. “Some of the sup- 
plies there might prove useful.” 
Captain Greenfield looked 
questioningly at Bemardi. The 
professor shrugged. “Might as 
well.” 

“All right,” the captain growl- 
ed. “Let’s pick up whatever we 
can save.” 



S INCE there wasn’t much that 
could be rescued, the little 
safari was soon on its way. Jrann- 
Pttt led, carrying Algol in his 
arms. Behind came Mortland, 
bearing a camp stool and the 
kettle into which he had tucked 
a tin of biscuits and intp which 
the mosquito-bat had' tucked it- 
self, its orange eyes glaring out 
angrily from beneath the lid. 
Next came Mrs. Bemardi with 
her knitting, her camp stool and 
her sorrow. 

Dfar-Lll followed with two 
stools and the plastic tea set. 
Close behind was Miss Anspach- 
er, with the sugar bowl, the earth- 
enware teapot and an immense 
bound volume of the Proceed- 
ings of the Physical Society of 
Ameranglis for 1993. Professor 
Bemardi bore a briefcase full of 
notes and the table. The rain 
had damaged the latter’s mecha- 
nism, so that its legs kept un- 
folding from time to time, to the 
great inconvenience of Captain 
Greenfield, who brought up the 
rear with the blasting equipment. 
Behind them and sometimes 
alongside them came something 
— or someone-— else. 

“Surely your camp must have 
been closer,, to ours than this,” 
Miss Anspacher' finally remarked 
after they had been slogging 
through mud and water and 
pushing aside reluctant vegeta- 
tion for over an Earth hour.

“I am very much afraid,” 
Jrann-Pttt admitted, “that our 
camp has been lost — that is to 
say, inundated.” 

“What are we going to do 
now?” the captain asked of the 
company at large. 

Professor Bernardi shrugged. 
“Our only course would seem to 
be making for one of the cities 
and throwing ourselves upon the 
na— Jrann-Pttt’s people’s hos- 
pitality. If Professor Jrann-Pttt 
has even the vaguest idea of the 
direction in which his home lies, 
we might as well head that way.” 
I wonder whether the natives 



could help us raise the ship. 

“I’m sure my people will be 
more than happy to welcome 
you,” Jrann-Pttt said smoothly, 
“and to make you comfortable 
until your people send another 
ship to fetch you.” 

The terrestrials looked at one 
another. Dfar-Lll looked at 
Jrann-Pttt. 

Professor Bernardi coughed. 
“That was the only spaceship we 
had,” he admitted. “The first ex- 
perimental model, you know.” 
We don't expect to stay on this 
awful planet forever. After all, as 
Louisa says, the Government will 




have to forgive us. Public opinion 
and all that. 

“Oh,” the saurian said. “Then 
we shall have the pleasure of 
your company until they build 
another?” 

There was silence. “We have 
the only plans,” the professor 
said, gripping his briefcase more 
tightly. “I am the inventor of 
the ship, so naturally I would 
have them.” If we brought back 
some specimens of Venusian life 
— of intelligent Venusian life — 
to prove we’d been here . 

“Matter of fact, old fellow,” 
Mortland said, “we took all the 



plans with us so they couldn’t 
build another ship and follow — 

“Mortland!” the professor ex- 
claimed. 

“But they’re telepaths,” Miss 
Anspacher said. “They must 
know already.” 

'IT'VERYONE turned to look at 
the saurians. 

“I have . certain informa- 
tion,” Jrann-Pttt admitted, “but 
I cannot understand it. You are 
in trouble with your rulers be- 
cause they would not give you 
the funds, claiming space travel 
was impossible?” 




“That’s right,” Bernardi said. 
Not really specimens, you un- 
derstand. Guests. 

“And you went ahead and ap- 
propriated the funds and mate- 
rials from your government, since 
you were in a trusted position 
where you could do so?” 

Bernardi nodded. 

“Of course the question is now 
academic, for the ship is gone, 
but since you proved the possi- 
bility of space travel by coming 
here, wouldn’t your government 
then dismiss the charges against 
you?” * 

“That’s exactly what I keep 
telling him!” Mrs. Bernardi ex- 
claimed. 

But her husband shook his 
head. “The law is inflexible. We 
have broken it and must be pun- 
ished, even if by breaking it we 
proved its fundamental error.” 
Why let him know our plans? 

Why, Jrann-Pttt, that sounds 
just like our own government, 
doesn't it? 

Yes, it does. We should be able 
to establish a very satisfactory 
mode of living with these stran- 
gers. 

“We’d hoped that after a year 
or so the whole thing would die 
down,” Mortland explained 
frankly, “and we’d go back as 
heroes.” 

“Do you know the way to your 
home, Jrann-Pttt?” the profes- 
sor asked anxiously. 



“Since we were able to catch 
a glimpse of the sun, I think I 
can figure out roughly where we 
are. All we must do is walk some 
two hundred kilometers in that 
direction — ” he waved an arm to 
indicate the way — “and we 
should be at the capital.” 

“Will your people accept us 
as refugees?” Miss Anspacher de- 
manded bluntly, “or will we be 
captives?” Which is what I'll bet 
the good professor is planning 
for you, if only he can figure 
some way to get you and, of 
course, ourselves back. 

“YWTE should be proud to ac- 

** cept you as citizens and 
to receive the benefits of your 
splendid technology. Our labo- 
ratories will be placed at your 
disposal.” 

“Well, that’s better than we 
hoped for,” the professor said, 
brightening. “We had expected 
to have to carve our own labora- 
tories out of the wilderness. Now 
we shall be able to carry on our 
researches in comfort.” No need 
to trouble the natives; we'll be 
able to raise the ship ourselves. 
Or build a new one. And I’ll see 
to it personally that they have 
special quarters in the zoo with 
a considerable amount of pri- 
vacy. 

“If I were you, I wouldn’t trust 
him too far,” the captain warned. 
“He’s a foreigner.”

“You ought to be ashamed of 
yourself, Captain!” Miss Ans- 
pacher said. “I, for one, trust 
Jrann-Pttt implicitly. Did you 
say this direction, Jrann-Pttt?” 
She stepped forward briskly. 
There was a loud splash and 
water closed over her head. 

C APTAIN Greenfield rushed 
forward to haul her out. 
“Well,” she said, daintily cough- 
ing up mud, “I was wet to begin 
with, anyway.” 

“You’re a brave little woman, 
Miss Anspacher,” the captain 
told her admiringly. 

“This sort of thing may pre- 
sent a problem,” Professor Ber- 
nardi commented. “I hope that 
was only a pot-hole, that the 
water is not going to be consis- 
tently too deep for wading.” 
“There might be quicksand, 
too,” Mrs. Bernardi said somber- 
ly. “In quicksand, one drowns 
slowly.” 

Dfar-Lll gave a start. Surely 
you don't intend to lead them 
back to base ? 

Precisely. The swamp is unfit 
for settlement. 

But to return voluntarily to 
captivity? 

Who mentioned anything 
about captivity? Assisted by our 
new friends, we have an excel- 
lent chance of taking over the 
ship and supplies by a surprise 
attack. 



But why should these aliens 
assist us? 

Jrann-Pttt smiled. Oh, I think 
they will. Yes, I have every con- 
fidence in Plan C. 

“I suggest,” the professor said, 
ignoring his wife’s pessimism, 
“that each one of us pull a branch 
from a tree. We can test the 
ground before we step on it, to 
make sure that there is solid 
footing underneath.” 

“Good idea,” the captain ap- 
proved. He reached out the arm 
that was not occupied with Miss 
Anspacher and tugged at a tree 
limb. 

And then he and the lady phy- 
sicist were both floundering in 
the ooze. 

“Well, really, Captain Green- 
field!” she cried, refusing his aid 
in extricating herself. “I always 
thought you were at least a gen- 
tleman in spite of your illiter- 
acy !” 

“Wha — what happened?” he 
asked as he struggled out of the 
mud. “Something pushed me; I 
swear it.” 

J RANN-PTTT mentalized. “It 
seems the tree did not like 
your trying to remove a branch.” 
“The tree!” Greenfield’s pale 
blue eyes bulged. “You’re jok- 
ing!” 

“Not at all. As a matter of 
fact, I myself have been wonder- 
ing why there were so many

thought-streams and yet so few 
animals around here. It never 
occurred to me that the vegeta- 
tion could be sentient and have 
such strong emotive defenses. In 
all my experience as a botanist, 
I—” 

“I thought you were a zoolo- 
gist,” Bernardi interrupted. 

“My people do not believe in 
excessive specialization,” the sau- 
rian replied. 

“Trees that think?” Mortland 
inquired incredulously. 

“They’re not very bright,” 
Jrann-Pttt explained, “but they 
don’t like having their limbs pull- 
ed off. I don’t suppose you 
would, either, for that matter.” 

“I propose,” Miss Anspacher 
said, shaking out her wet hair, 
“that we break up the camp 
stools and use the sticks instead 
of branches to help us along.” 

“Good idea,” the captain said, 
trying to get back into her good 
graces. “I always knew women 
could put their brains to use if 
they tried.” 

She glared at him. 

“I thought we’d use the furni- 
ture to make a fire later,” Mort- 
land complained. “For tea, you 
know.” 

“The ground’s much too wet,” 
Professor Bernardi replied. 

“And Resides,” Miss Anspacher 
added, “I lost the teapot in that 
pot-hole.” 

“But you managed to save the 



Proceedings of the Physical So- 
ciety,” Mortland snarled. “Serve 
you right if I eat it. And I warn 
you, if hard-pressed, I shall.” 

“How will we cook our food, 
though?” Mrs. Bernardi demand- 
ed apprehensively. “It’s a lucky 
thing, Mr. Pitt, that we have you 
with us to tell us which of the 
berries and things are edible, so 
at least we shan’t starve.” 

The visible portion of Jrann- 
Pttt’s well-knit form turned 
deeper green. “But I regret to say 
I don’t know, Mrs, Bernardi. 
Those 'native’ foods I served you 
were all synthetics from our per- 
sonal stores. I never tasted natu- 
ral foods before I met you.” 

“And if the trees don’t like 
our taking their branches,” Miss 
Anspacher put in, “I don’t sup- 
pose the bushes would like our 
taking their berries. Louisa, don’t 
do that!” 

But Mrs. Bernardi, with her 
usual disregard for orders, had 
fainted into the mud. Pulling her 
out and reviving her caused so 
much confusion, it wasn’t until 
then that they discovered Algol 
had disappeared. 

rpHE party had been trudging 
through mud and water and 
struggling with pale, malevolent 
vines and bushes and low-hang- 
ing branches for close to six Earth 
hours. All of them were tired and 
hungry, now that their meager

supply of biscuits and chocolate 
was gone. 

“Remember, Carl,” Mrs. Ber- 
nardi told her husband, “I for- 
give you. And I know I’m being 
foolishly sentimental*, but if you 
could manage to take my body 
back to Earth — ” 

“Don’t be so pessimistic.” Pro- 
fessor Bernardi absent-mindedly 
leaned against a tree, then re- 
coiled as he remembered it might 
resent being treated like an in- 
animate object. “In any case, 
we’ll most likely all die at the 
same time.” 

“I never did want to go to Ve- 
nus, really,” Mrs. Bernardi snif- 
fled. “I only came, like Algol did, 
because I didn’t have any choice. 
If you left me behind, I’d have 
had to bear the brunt of . 
Where is Algol?” She stared at 
Jrann-Pttt. “You were carrying 
him. What have you done with 
him?” 

The lizard-man looked at her 
in consternation. “He jumped out 
of my arms when you fainted and 
I turned back to help. I was cer- 
tain one of the others had him.” 

“He’s dead!” she wailed. “You 
let him fall into the water and 
drown — an innocent kitty that 
never hurt anybody, except in 
fun.” 

“Come, come, Louisa.” Her 
husband took her arm. “He was 
only a cat. I’m sure Jrann-Pttt 
didn’t mean for him to drown. 



He was just so upset by your 
fainting that he didn’t think . 

“Not Jrann-Pttt’s fault, of 
course,” Miss Anspacher said. 

“After all, we can’t expect 
them to love animals as we do. 
But Algol was a very good sort 
of cat . 

“Keep quiet, all of you!” 
Jrann-Pttt shouted. “I have never 
known any species to use any 
method of communication so 
much in order to communicate 
so little. Don’t you understand? 
I would not have assumed the 
cat was with one of you, if I had 
not subconsciously sensed his 
thought-stream all along. He 
must be nearby.” 

Everyone was still, while 
Jrann-Pttt probed the dense un- 
derbrush that blocked their view 
on both sides. “Over here,” he 
announced, and led the way 
through the thick screen of in- 
terlaced bushes and vines on the 
left. 

About ten meters farther on, 
the ground sloped up sharply to 
form a ridge rising a meter and 
a half above the rest of the ter- 
rain. The water had not reached 
its blunted top, and on this fairly 
level strip of ground, perhaps 
three meters wide, Algol had 
been paralleling their path in 
dry-pawed comfort. 

“Scientists!” Louisa Bernardi 
almost spat. “Professors! We 
could have been walking on that,

too. But did anybody think to 
look for dry ground? No! It was 
wet in one place, so it would be 
wet in another. Oh, Algol — ” she 
reached over to embrace the cat 
— “you’re smarter than any so- 
called intelligent life-forms.” 

He indignantly straightened a 
whisker she had crumpled. 

“T OOK,” Mortland exclaimed 
in delight as they attained 
the top of the ridge, “here are 
some dryish twigs! Don’t sup- 
pose the trees want them, since 
they’ve let them fall. If I can 
get a fire going, we could boil 
some swamp water and make 
tea. Nasty thought, but it’s bet- 
ter than no tea at all. And how 
long can one go on living with- 
out tea?” 

“We’ll need some food before 
long, too,” Professor Bernardi 
observed, putting his briefcase 
down on a fallen log. “The usual 
procedure, I believe, would be for 
us to draw straws to see which 
gets eaten — although there isn’t 
any hurry.” 

“I’m glad then that we’ll be 
able to have a fire,” Mortland 
said, busily collecting twigs. “I 
should hate to have to eat you 
raw, Carl.” 

Mr. Pitt and his little friend 
are delightful creatures, Mrs. 
Bernardi thought. So intelligent 
and so well behaved. But eating 
them wouldn’t really be canni- 



balism. They aren’t people. 

That premise works both ways, 
dear lady, Jrann-Pttt ideated. 
And I must say your species will 
prove tar easier to peel for the 
cooking pot. 

“Monster! What are you do- 
ing?” Mortland dropped his twigs 
and pulled the mosquito-bat 
away from a bush. “Don’t eat 
those berries, you silly ass; the 
bush won’t like it!” The mos- 
quito-bat piped wrathfully. 

Jrann-Pttt probed with intent- 
ness. “You know, I rather think 
the bush wants its berries to be 
eaten. Somthing to do with — er 
— propagating itself. Of course it 
has a false impression as to what 
is going to be done with the ber- 
ries, but the important fact is 
that it won’t put up any resist- 
ance.” 

“All right, old fellow.” Mort- 
land released the mosquito -bat, 
which promptly flew back to the 
bush. “I’m not the custodian of 
your morals.” 

“I wonder whether we could 
eat those berries, too,” Professor 
Bernardi remarked pensively. 

“Carl!” Mrs. Bernardi’s tear- 
stained face flushed pink. “Why 
— why, that’s almost indecent!” 

“We eat beans, don’t we?” 
Mortland pointed out. “They’re 
seeds.” 

“We also eat meat,” Miss Ans- 
pacher added. 

There was silence. “I imagine,” 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Mrs. Bemardi murmured, “it’s 
because we never get to meet the 
meat socially.” She avoided the 
saurians’ eyes. 

• “We’d better see how Monster 
makes out, though,” Miss Ans- 
pacher observed, replenishing her 
lipstick, “before we try the ber- 
ries _ourselves. The fact that the 
bush is anxious to dispose of 
them doesn’t mean they can’t be 
poisonous.” 

“Why should Monster sacrifice 
himself for us?”. Mortland re- 
torted hotly, overlooking the fact 
that Monster’s purpose in eating 
the berries was almost certainly 
not an altruistic one. “If we can 
risk his life, we can risk our own.” 
He crammed a handful of ber- 
ries into his mouth defiantly. 
“I say, they’re good!” 

Algol sniffed the bush with dis- 
gust, then turned away. 

“See?" said Miss Anspacher. 
“They’re undoubtedly poisonous. 
When he’s really hungry, he isn’t 
so fussy.” She combed her hair. 

“But is he really hungry?” 
Bernardi asked suspiciously. 
“Come here, Algol. Nice kitty.” 
He bent down and sniffed the 
cat’s breath. The cat sniffed his 
interestedly. Their whiskers 
touched. “I thought so. Fish!” 

“VT'OU mean,” Mrs. Bernardi 
shrieked, “that while we 
were struggling through that wa- 
ter, alternately starving and 



drowning by centimeters, that 
wretched cat has not only been 
walking along here dry as toast, 
but gorging himself on fish?” 
“Now, now, Mrs. Bernardi,” 
Jrann-Pttt said. “Being a dumb 
animal, he wouldn’t think of in- 
forming you about matters of 
which he’d assume that you, as 
the superior beings, would be 
fully cognizant.” 

“You might have told us there 
were fish on this planet, Mr. 
Pitt.” 

“Dear lady, there is something 
I feel I should tell you. I am 
not — ” 

“They’re here on the other side 
of the ridge,” Greenfield called, 
bending over and peering through 
the foliage. “The fish, I mean.” 
“The pools look shallow,” Ber- 
nardi said, also bending over. 
“The fish should be easy enough 
to catch. Might even be able to 
get them in our hands.” He 
reached out to demonstrate, prov- 
ing the error of both his theses, 
for the fish slipped right through 
his fingers and, as he grabbed for 
them, he lost his balance, top- 
pled over the side of the ridge 
into the mud and water below 
and began to disappear, showing 
beyond a doubt that the pools 
were deeper than he had thought. 

“Carl, what are you doing?” 
Mrs. Bernardi peered into the 
murky depths where her husband 
was threshing about. “Why don’t

you come out of that filthy 
mud?” 

His voice, though muffled, was 
still acid. “It isn’t mud, my dear. 
It’s quicksand!” 

“Rope!” the captain exclaim- 
ed, grabbing a coil. 

“Hold on, chaps!” cried a 
squeaky voice. “I’m coming to 
the rescue!” A stout twelve-foot 
vine plunged out of the shadows 
and wrapped one end of itself 
around a tree — disregarding the 
latter’s violent objections — and 
the other end around Professor 
Bernardi’s thorax, which was just 
disappearing into the mud. “Now 
if one or two of you would haul 
away, we’ll soon have him out 
all shipshape and proper. Heave 
ho! Don’t be afraid of hurting 
me; my strength is as the strength 
of ten because my heart is pure.” 
“It’s that vine!” Dfar-Lll ex- 
claimed. “So that’s what has been 
following us all along!” 

“T CAN accept the idea of a 
•1- vegetable’s thinking,” Pro- 
fessor Bernardi gasped as he was 
pulled out of the quicksand, “al- 
though with the utmost reluc- 
tance.” He shook himself like a 
dog. “But how can it be mobile?” 
“You chaps can move around,” 
the vine explained, “so I said to 
myself: ‘Dammit, I’ll have a shot 
at doing that, too.’ Hard going 
at first, when you’re using suck- 
ers, but I persevered and I made 

148 



it. Look, I can talk, too. Never 
heard of a vine doing that before, 
did you? Fact is, I hadn’t thought 
of it before, but then I never had 
anyone to communicate with. All 
those other vines are so stupid; 
you have absolutely no idea! 
Hop you don’t mind my picking 
up your language, but it was the 
only one around — ” 

“We are honored,” Professor 
Bernardi declared. “And I am 
deeply grateful to you, too, sir 
or madam, for saving my life.” 

“Think nothing of it,” the vine 
said, arranging its leaves, which 
were of a pleasing celadon rather 
than the whitish-green favored 
by the rest of the local vegeta- 
tion. “Now that I can move, I’ll 
probably be doing heroic things 
like that all the time. Are you all 
going to the city? May I go with 
you? I’ve heard lots about the 
city,” it went on, taking consent 
for granted, “but I never thought 
I’d get to see it. Everybody in 
the swamp is such an old stick- 
in-the-mud. I thought I was 
trapped, too, forced to spend the 
rest of my life in a provincial 
environment. Is it true that the 
streets are filled with chloro- 
phyll? Do you think I can get a 
job in a botanical garden or 
something? Perhaps I can give 
little talks on horticulture to vis- 
itors?” 

The mosquito-bat looked out 
of the tea kettle austerely. “Mon- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ster!” it piped shrilly. 

“The very idea!” the vine 
snapped back indignantly. “Oh, 
well,” it said, calming down, 
“you probably don’t know any 
better. It's up to me as the in- 
telligent life-form to forgive you, 
and I shall.” 

Jrann-Pttt and Dfar-Lll looked 
at each other in consternation. 
Do you think there really are 
cities on this planet, sir? Can 
there be indigenous intelligent 
life? If so, it may have already 
got in touch with the comman- 
dant. 

Impossible, Jrann-Pttt replied. 
The vine probably just heard us 
talking about a city. After all, it 
picked up the language that way; 
very likely it absorbed some ter- 
restrial concepts along with it. 
If there, are any real settlements 
at all, they must be quite primi- 
tive — nothing more than villages. 
No, it’s we who will build the 
cities on Venus. Combining our 
technology with the terrestrials’ , 
we could develop a pretty little 
civilization here — after we’ve dis- 
posed of the commandant, so he 
cant report our disappearance. 
We don't want any publicity. So 
much better to keep our little 
society exclusive. 

W ONDER what time it is,” 
the captain remarked as 
he rose and stretched in the dim 
yellow light of the long Venusian 



day. “Must have slept for hours. 
My watch seems to have stop- 
ped.” 

“Mine, too.” Mortland un- 
strapped his from his wrist and 
shook it futilely. “Waterproof, 
hah! If we ever get back to 
Earth, I shall make the manu- 
facturer eat his guarantee.” 

“Oh, well, what does time mat- 
ter to us now?” Professor Ber- 
nardi pointed out as he rose from 
his leafy couch with a loud creak. 
All of them — even the saurians 
— had aches and pains in every 
joint and muscle as a result of 
the unaccustomed exercise and 
the damp climate. “We are out 
of its reach. It has no present 
meaning for us.” 

This depressed them all. Only 
the vine seemed in good health 
and spirits. “I notice you’re all 
wearing clothes except for the 
short four-legged gentleman with 
the home-grown fur coat,” it 
chattered happily. “Do you think 
I'll be socially acceptable with- 
out them? I wouldn’t want to 
make a bad impression at the 
very start — or would leaves do?” 
Everybody looked at Jrann- 
Pttt. “We are not a narrow- 
minded species,” he said hastily. 
“I’m sure your leaves will be 
more than adequate.” 

After a breakfast of fish and 
berries stewed in tea — which the 
vine declined with thanks — the 
various members of the party 



COLLECTOR'S ITEM 



149 




gathered up their belongings and 
resumed their journey. Encrusted 
with dried purple mud and 
grime, their clothes deliberately 
torn by anti-social shrubbery, 
their chins — of the males, that is 
— disfigured by hirsute growths, 
the terrestrials made a sorry 
spectacle. It was hot, boiling hot, 
and more humid than ever. 

“Well,” said Miss Anspacher, 
letting the Swahili marching song 
with which she had been at- 
tempting to encourage the com- 
pany peter out, “I do hope we’ll 
reach your city soon, Jrann-Pttt. 
I must say I could use a hot 
bath.” She added hastily, “Hot 
baths are a peculiar cultural trait 
of ours.” 

“I could use one myself,” 
Jrann-Pttt said. He brushed his 
scales fastidiously. 

“I’m looking forward so to 
meeting your relatives,” she said, 
grabbing his left arm determined- 
ly. “I’m not violating a taboo or 
anything, am I?” It isn't really 
slimy; it just feels that way. 

“Not one of my people's. But 
I’m afraid you are violating a 
terrestrial taboo, judging from 
the thoughts I pick up from your 
captain’s mind.” 

“Oh, him — he’s a stupid fool!” 
“Not at all. Rough, perhaps. 
Untutored, yes. But with a good 
deal of native intelligence, al- 
though fearfully primitive.” 
“Perhaps I was too harsh,” 



Miss Anspacher observed 
thoughtfully. The captain. is 
good-looking in a brutal sort of 
way, although not nearly as 
handsome or even as spiritual in 
appearance as Jrann-Pttt. And 
sometimes I almost think he — 
she blushed to herself — shows a 
certain partiality for my com- 
pany. 

S HE did not, however, let go 
of the saurian’s arm when 
the captain bustled up, prepared 
to put a stop to this, but tact- 
fully, if possible, for he had be- 
gun to realize that his rude ways 
did not endear him to her. 

“Ah — we’re making very good 
progress, aren’t we, Pitt?” he in- 
terrupted, trying to insinuate 
himself between the two. 
“Excellent.” 

“How soon do you think we’ll 
be at your city at this rate?” 
Jrann-Pttt shrugged. “Since 
I have no way of telling what 
our rate is or how far we have 
gone, how can I tell? As a matter 
of fact, you might as well learn 
now as later — I am not a Venu- 
sian. There is no intelligent life 
native to Venus.” 

“Oh, really!” the vine inter- 
posed indignantly. “Saying a 
thing like that right in front of 
me! What would you call me, 
then, pray tell?” 

Jrann-Pttt kept his actual 
thoughts to himself. “A muta- 



150 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tion,” he said. “Probably you are 
the first intelligent life-form to 
appear upon this planet. Schol- 
arly volumes will be written 
about you.” 

“Oh?” The vine seemed to be 
appeased. “I accept your apol- 
ogy. Perhaps I’ll learn to write 
and do the books myself, be- 
cause I’m the only one who can 
understand the real me.” 

“But how can you show us the 
way to your city if you’re not 
native to Venus?” Bernardi de- 
manded, whirling fretfully upon 
the saurian. “What is this, any- 
way? Each time you come up 
with a different story!” 

“See?” said the captain. “Did- 
n’t I tell you he was up to no 
good?” 

“I should like to lead you to 
our base,” Jrann-Pttt replied 
with quiet dignity. “I am telling 
you the truth now since I feel 
I should have your consent be- 
fore proceeding farther.” 

??????? Dfar-Lll projected. 

“I hesitated before, because I 
wasn't sure I could trust you. 
You see, the spaceship in which 
we came to this planet is a prison 
ship, with a crew consisting of 
malefactors — thieves, murderers, 
defrauders — dispatched to the 
remote fastnesses of the Galaxy 
to fetch back zoological speci- 
mens. Our zoo, I must say, is the 
finest and most interesting in the 
Universe.” 



“Monster!” the mosquito-bat 
squeaked. 

“Shhh,” Mortland admonish- 
ed. “Don’t interrupt.” 

“I was in command of our ill- 
fated expedition . .” 

Oh, Dfar-Lll projected. For a 
moment there, sir, you had me 
worried. 

“When we reached Venus, I 
was, I must admit; careless. I 
gave the crew a chance to mu- 
tiny and they did. Slew most of 
the officers. Dfar-Lll and I were 
lucky to escape with our lives.” 
“But you might have told us!” 
Mrs. Bernardi’s voice held re- 
proach. 

“Until we knew what kind of 
beings you were, we couldn’t let 
you know how helpless and un- 
protected we were.” 

The women seemed moved, but 
not the men. 

“Leading us on a wild goose 
chase, were you?” the captain 
challenged. 

J RANN-PTTT drew a deep 
breath. “It was my hope that 
all of you would consent to help 
us get our ship back from these 
criminals. Then we could fly to 
my planet — which is the fifth of 
the star you know as Alpha Cen- 
taurr — where, I assure you, you 
would be hospitably received.” 
We aren’t really ioing back 
home, Jrann-Pttt, are we? I’d 
sooner stay here in the swamp 



COLLECTOR'S ITEM 



151 




than go back to that jail. 

Have confidence in me, r-Lll. 
As soon as we have disposed of 
the commandant and his officers, 
I can put our ship out of com- 
mission. The terrestrials won't be 
able to tell what's wrong. They 
know nothing about space travel. 
The fact that they got their crude 
vessel to operate was probably 
sheer luck. 

But the younger was not to 
be diverted. Will we kill them 
after we've disposed of our offi- 
cers? I should hate to. 

Certainly not. We shall need 
servants and I don't trust the 
prisoners in the ship — all crimi- 
nals of the lowest type! Aloud, 
he said to the bewildered terres- 
trials, “If you don’t want to help 
us, I shall understand. No sense 
your interfering in another spe- 
cies* quarrels, particularly as we 
must seem like monsters to you.” 

“Monster!” the mosquito-bat 
agreed. “Monster, monster, mon- 
ster!” No one tried to stop him. 
Jrann-Pttt sensed that somehow 
he had lost a good deal of his 
grip on the terrestrials. Finesse, 
he thought angrily, was wasted 
on these barbaric life-forms. 

Bernardi sighed. “I suppose 
we’ll have to help you.” No rea- 
son why his ship shouldn't stop 
off at Earth before it goes to 
Alpha Centauri. No reason why 
it should even go to Alpha Cen- 
tauri at all, in tact. 



“If you ask me,” the captain 
said, “he’s one of the criminals 
himself.” 

“But nobody asked you,” Miss 
Anspacher retorted, the more 
acidly because she had been won- 
dering the same thing. “Shall we 
resume our journey?” 

“Hold on,” the vine said. “I 
don’t want to intrude or any- 
thing, but it hasn’t been made 
quite clear to me whether or not 
I’m included in the invitation to 
this Alpha Centauri place, and I 
wouldn’t want to keep going only 
on the off-chance that you might 
ask me. I really think you 
should, because you led me astray 
with your fair promises of glit- 
tering cities.” 

“The cities of our planet do 
not glitter,” Jrann-Pttt replied, 
wishing it would wither instant- 
ly, “but certainly you are invited. 
Glad to have you.” 

“Oh, that’s awfully decent of 
you,” the vine said emotionally. 
“I shan’t forget it, I promise 
you,” 

rriHEY plodded onward, the 
vine chattering so incessantly 
that a faint gurgling which ac- 
companied them went unnoticed. 
The gurgling grew louder and 
louder as they pushed on. Fi- 
nally, “I keep hearing water,” 
Mortland remarked. “We must 
be approaching a river of some 
kind.” 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




A few minutes later, bursting 
through a screen of underbrush, 
they found themselves confront- 
ed by a river whose bubbling 
violet -blue waters extended for 
at least four kilometers from 
shadowy bank to bank, with the 
ridge tapering to a point almost 
in its exact center. 

Apparently, while they had 
been trekking along the eleva- 
tion, the surrounding terrain, 
concealed from them by the dense 
and evil-minded vegetation, had 
imperceptibly taken off, leaving 
the ridge to become a peninsula 
that jutted out into the river. 
They seemed to be stranded. All 
they could do was retrace their 
steps and, since they had no 
idea how far back the spit be- 
came part of the mainland again, 
the return journey might last al- 
most as long as it had taken 
them to get there. 

“I know we’re heading in the 
right direction,” Jrann-Pttt de- 
fended himself. “I wasn’t aware 
of the river because we must 
have come by an overland route.” 
Although he was telling the truth, 
at least insofar as he knew it 
himself, no one, not even Dfar- 
Lll, believed him. 

“But let’s rest a bit before we 
turn back,” Mortland proposed, 
flopping to the ground. “I’m ut- 
terly used up.” 

“Maybe we don’t need to go 
back,” the vine said. “Not all the 



way, anyhow.” Everyone stared. 
It waved its leaves brightly at 
them. “I notice the captain 
thoughtfully brought along lots 
of rope and there were scads of 
fallen logs just a bit back. Could- 
n’t you just lash the logs together 
with the rope and make a — a 
thing on which we could float the 
rest of the way? On the water, 
you know.” 

The others continued to look 
at it open-mouthed. 

“Just a little idea I had,” it 
said modestly. “May not amount 
to much, but then you can’t tell 
until you’ve tried, can you?” 

“It — he — means a raft, I 
think,” Mrs. Bernardi said. 

Jrann-Pttt probed the raft con- 
cept in her mind, for he found 
the vegetable’s mental processes 
curiously obscure. “What an ex- 
cellent idea!” he exclaimed. 

“It does not seem infeasible,” 
Professor Bernardi admitted 
tightly. By now, he was suspi- 
cious of everyone and everything. 
If I had never broached the idea 
of space travel to those peasants, 
he thought, I would be on Earth 
in the dubious comfort of my 
own home. That's what comes of 
trying to help humanity. 

“TJ/ELL,” observed the captain 
** as the heavy raft hit the 
water with a tremendous splash, 
“she seems to be riverworthy.” 
He rubbed his hands in anticipa-

tion, much of his surliness gone, 
now that he was about to deal 
with something he understood. 
“Since she is, in a manner of 
speaking, a ship, I suppose I 
assume command again?” He 
waited for objections, glancing 
involuntarily in Jrann-Pttt’s di- 
rection. There were none. 
“Right,” he said, repressing any 
outward symptoms of relief. 

He efficiently deployed the 
personnel to the positions on the 
raft where he felt they might be 
least useless, the gear being piled 
in the middle and surmounted by 
Algol, who naturally assumed 
possession of the softest and saf- 
est place by the divine right of 
cats. 

The captain does have a com- 
manding presence, Miss Ans- 
pacner thought, and a sort of 
uncouth grace. Moreover, he can- 
not read my mind — in fact, he 
often cannot even understand me 
when I speak. 

“All right!” he bellowed. “Cast 
off!” 

The vine unfastened the rope 
that it had insouciantly attached 
to a tree trunk, remarking to the 
others, “Don’t let the trees in- 
timidate you. Actually their bark 
is worse than their bite.” Now 
it dropped lithely on board the 
raft, looking for a comfortable 
resting place. 

“Please don’t twine around 
me,” Miss Anspacher said coldly. 



“If you insist upon coming with 
us, you will have to choose an 
inanimate object to cling to.” 
“All right, all right,” it tried 
to soothe her. “No need to get 
yourself all worked up over such 
a mere triviality, is there? I’ll 
just coil myself tidily around one 
of those spare logs. I must say 
you’re warmer, though.” 

Yes, she is, isn't she? thought 
the captain, and squeezed her 
hand. 

T HE raft drifted down the 
river. Since the current was 
flowing in the desired direction, 
there did not appear to be any 
need to use the poles, and every- 
one sat or reclined as comfort- 
ably as possible in the suffocat- 
ing heat. The yellow haze had 
become so thick that they seemed 
to be at the bottom of a custard 
cup. 

“I do . hope we’re heading the 
right way,” Professor Bernardi 
said, although who knows what 
is right and what is wrong any 
more? 

“Perhaps we aren’t,” Mrs. Ber- 
nardi mused, stroking Algol, who 
had crawled into her lap. “Per- 
haps we will go drifting along 
endlessly. Every sixteen days, it 
will get dark and every sixteen 
days it will get light, and mean- 
while we will continue floating 
along, never going anywhere,

way. So I don’t really see that 
it makes much difference if you 
go to Jrann-Pttt’s Alpha Cen- 
tauri place. So much nicer to be 
living with friends, I should 
think.” 

“But Alpha Centauri is so very 
far away,” Mrs. Bernardi sighed. 
“There wouldn’t be much chance 
of our ever getting back.” 

“Look!” Mortland exclaimed. 
“The river’s branching. Which 
fork do we take?” 

J RANN-PTTT, who had been 
dabbling his arms idly in the 
translucent violet-blue water, 
withdrew them hastily as nine 
green eyes, obviously belonging 
to the same individual, rose to 
the surface and regarded him 
with more than casual interest. 
He consulted his compass. 
“Left.” 

“Contrarily!” the mosquito -bat 
suddenly squeaked, pointing a 
small rod at his companions. 
“Rightward.” 

There was a stunned silence. 
“Monster!” Mortland cried in 
reproach. “You can talk! How 
could you deceive us like that?” 
“Can talk,” the creature re- 
torted. “Me not intelligent life- 
form, ha! Who talks last talks 
best. Have not linguistic facility 
of inferior life-forms, but can 
communicate rudely in your lan- 
guage.” 



“Remember,” Mortland* cau- 
tioned, “there are ladies present.” 
“Have been lying low and 
laughing to self — ha, ha! — at wit- 
lessness of lowerly life-forms.” 
“But why?” Mrs. Bernardi de- 
manded distractedly. “Haven’t 
we been kind to you?” 

“You be likewise well treated 
in our zoo,” it assured her. “All 
of you. Our zoo finest in Galaxy. 
And clean, too.” 

“Now really, sir, I must pro- 
test — ” Professor Bernardi began, 
trying to extricate a blaster un- 
obtrusively from the pile of gear 
in which the too-confident ter- 
restrials had cached their wea- 
pons. 

Monster gestured with his rod. 
“This is lethal weapon. Do not 
try hindrancing me. Hate dam- 
age fine specimens. Captain, go 
rightward.” 

“Oh, is that so!” Greenfield 
retorted hotly. “Let me tell you, 
you — you insect!” 

“George!” Miss Anspacher 
clutched his arm. “Do what it 
says. For my sake, George!” 

“Oh, all right,” he muttered. 
“Just for you, then. Told you 
not to trust any of ’em,” he went 
on, reluctantly poling the raft in 
the ordered direction. “Foreign- 
ers !” 

“Fine zoo,” the mosquito-bat 
insisted. “Very clean. Run with 
utmost efficientness. Strict visit- 
ing hours.”

“ A ND there goes Plan D,” the 
vine said lightly. There was 
a hint of laughter in its voice. 
Jrann-Pttt stared at it in con- 
sternation. “Are you' also from 
the Alpha Centauri system, sir?” 
It turned its attention to the mos- 
quito-bat. “Naturally I’m curious 
to know where I’m going,” it 
explained, “since I seem defi- 
nitely to be included in your gra- 
cious invitation.” 

“Alpha Centauri, hah!” the 
mosquito-bat snorted. “I from 
what Earthlets laughingly term 
Sirius. Alpha Centauri merely 
little star.” 

“Now see here!” Jrann-Pttt 
sprang to his feet. Criminal he 
might be, but he was not going 
to sit there and have his sun in- 
sulted! 

“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” Miss 
Anspacher cried. “No use getting 
yourself killed, Jrann-Pttt!” 

“Correctly,” Monster approved. 
“Elementary intelligence display- 
ed. Why damage fine speci- 
mens?” 

From one prison into another, 
the saurian mentalized bitterly. 

Fes, returned Dfar-Lll, and 
it’s all your fault . The junior 
lizard burst into tears. I wish I 
had let Merglyt-Ruuu do what 
he ' wanted. I would have been 
better off. 

“Sirius,” the vine repeated. 
“That’s even farther away than 
Alpha Centauri, isn’t it? I never 



thought I would get that far 
away from the swamp! This real- 
ly will be an adventure!” 

“How . do you know — ” Pro- 
fessor Bemardi began. 

“Frankly,” it went on, “I don’t 
see why you chaps are so put 
out by the whole thing. What’s 
the difference between Alpha 
Centauri and Sirius anyway? 
Matter of a few light-years, but 
otherwise a star’s a star for all 
that.” 

“To Jrann-Pttt, we wouldn’t 
have been specimens,” Mrs. Ber- 
nardi said, belatedly recognizing 
the advantages of Alpha Cen- 
tauri. 

“No, not specimens,” the vine 
told her easily. “I don’t suppose 
you know he had no intention 
of taking you back to his system. 
He wanted you to help him kill 
the officers of his ship so they 
couldn’t look for him and the 
other escaped prisoner or report 
back to his planet. Then he was 
going to put the ship out of 
commission and found his own 
colony here with you as his 
slaves. I’d just as soon be a spe- 
cimen as a slave. Sooner. Better 
to reign in a zoo than serve in 
a swamp!” 

“Just how do you know all 
this?” Miss Anspacher demand- 
ed. 

“It’s obvious enough,” Bernar- 
di said gloomily. “Another tele- 
path.” How can we compete or

even cope with creatures like 
these? What a fool I was to think 
I could outwit them. 

“Telepathy just tricksome- 
ness, “ the mosquito-bat put in 
jealously. “I have no telepathy, 
yet superior to all.” 

“¥>UT why should Mr. Pitt 
want to kill his officers?” 
Mrs. Bernardi asked querulously. 
“He’s the commandant, isn’t he? 
Or is he a professor? I never got 
that straight.” 

“He was one of the criminals 
on the ship,” the vine told her. 
“What you might call a confi- 
dence man. This is about the 
only system in the Galaxy where 
he isn’t wanted. He did tell you 
the truth, though, when he said 
they were sent on an expedition 
to collect zoological specimens. 
Dangerous work,’’ it sighed, “and 
so his people use criminals for it. 
They were sent out in small de- 
tachments. Our friend here killed 
his guard in a fight over a fe- 
male prisoner, which was why — ” 
“But what happened to the 
female prisoner?” Miss Anspach- 
er’s eye caught Dfar-LU’s. “Oh, 
no!” she gasped. 

“Why not?” Dfar-Lll demand- 
ed. “I’m as much of a female as 
you are. Maybe even more.” 
The captain leaned close to 
Miss Anspacher. “No one can be 
more feminine than you are, Do- 
lores,” he whispered. 



“But he — she’s so young!” 
Mrs. Bernardi wailed. 

The vine made an amused 
sound. “Don’t you have juvenile 
delinquents on Earth?” 

“Oh, what does all that matter 
now?” Jrann-Pttt said sullenly. 
“We’re all going to a Sirian zoo, 
anyway.” 

“Correctly,” approved the 
monster-bat. “Finest zoo. Clean. 
Commodious cages. Reasonable 
visiting hours. Very nice.” 

Mrs. Bernardi began to cry. 

“Now,” the vine comforted her, 
“a zoo’s not so bad. After all, 
most of us spend our lives in 
cages of one kind or another, and 
without the basic security a zoo 
affords — ” 

“But we don’t know we’re in 
cages,” Mrs. Bernardi sobbed. 
“That’s the important thing.” 

Professor Bernardi looked at 
the vine. “But why are you—” 
he began, then halted. “Perhaps 
I don’t want an answer,” he said. 
There was no hope at all left in 
him, now that there was no 
doubt. 

“You are wise,” the vine agreed 
quietly. Algol arose from Mr. 
Bernardi’s lap and rubbed against 
its thick pale green stem. He 
knew. The mosquito- bat looked 
at both of them restlessly. 

The yellow haze had deepened 
to old gold. Now it was beginning 
to turn brown. 

"It’s twilight,” Miss Anspacher

observed. “Soon it will be dark.” 
“Perhaps we’ll sail right past 
his ship in the night,” Mortland 
suggested hopefully. 

The mosquito*bat gave a snort. 
“Ship has lights. All modern con- 
venients.” 

S UDDENLY the air seemed to 
have grown chilly — colder 
than it had any right to be on 
that torrid planet. All around 
them, it was dark and very quiet. 

“I think I do see lights,” Mort- 
land said. 

“Must be ship,” Monster re- 
plied. And somehow the rest of 
them could sense the uneasiness 
in the thin, piping, alien voice. 
“Must be!” 

“Your ship’s a very large one 
then,” Bernardi commented as 
they rounded a bend and a whole 
colony of varicolored pastel lights 
sprang up ahead of them. 

“Not my ship!” the mosquito- 
bat exclaimed in a voice pierced 
with anguish. “Not my ship!” 



Before them rose the fantastic, 
twisting, convoluting, turning 
spires of a tall, marvelous, glit- 
tering city. 

“You will find that the streets 
actually are filled with chloro- 
phyll,” the vine said. “And I 
know you’ll be happy here, all 
of you. You see, we can’t have 
you going back to your planets 
now. No matter how good your 
intentions were, you’d destroy us. 
You do see that, don’t you?” 
“You may be right,” Bernardi 
agreed dispiritedly, “although 
that doesn’t cheer us any. But 
what will you do with us?” 
“You’ll be provided with liv- 
ing quarters comparable to those 
on your own planets,” the vine 
told him, “and you’ll give lec- 
tures just as if you were in a 
university— only you’ll be much 
more secure. I assure you — ” its 
voice was very gentle now — 
“you’ll hardly know you’re in a 
zoo.”
