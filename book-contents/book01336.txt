WHAT SPACE IS FOR 



N ot long ago, one of our satellites 
■was put to work photomapping 
part of Arizona — something that 
sateAliites can do rather better than 
any other means known to man, if 
only (because a single exposure photo- 
graphs a whole state at that mo- 
ment. ( Conventional aerial photo- 
graphs have to be patched together, 
and that's a mess, when you've got 
a piece photographed at 7:00 AM 
that should match up with one pho- 
tographed at noon. But how? The 
angles of the shadows are different; 
the appearance is different; the in- 
formation is there, sort of, but it 
takes a highly trained analyst to 
get it out.) In the northwest comer 
of Ajrizona the picture revealed a 
long, thin line. 

A geological fault I — crowed the 
photo-interpi'etation crew, a fault 
where no one had ever detected one 
before I And so teams of geologists 
hotfooted it out to the indicated 
point, because a geological fault is 
not juist a point of interest, it is 
more often than not a place where 
minerals can be found. Unfortunate- 
ly no minerals were found in this 
case, ibecause the “fault” turned out 
to be a range fence, photographed 
from orbit. 

The way we heard about that was 
Ksteninjg to one scientist telling a 
joke on some other scientists — and 
as a matter of fact, the reactions 
were probably pretty funny •when 
they reached their “fault” site. But 
ever and above the anecdotal value 
of the incident, it illustrates some- 



thing about the capacities of our 
satellites. We can see a lot from 
space; and we can report it back to 
Earth, very quickly, very quickly 
and reliably. 

A couple of days later, the Near 
East erupted into war; and 
about a week later, the United Na- 
tions erupted into its own kind of 
war, a war of words, -with much 
talk about whose trooi)s were where 
and whose aircraft carriers were do- 
ing what to whom. Listening to the 
bland and barefaced statements of 
some of the diplomats involved as 
they appeared on television, we 
couldn't help thinking of those recon 
satellites . and couldn't help wish- 
ing we had a few more of them in 
orbit, openly reporting to the world 
what they observed with their elec- 
tronic eyes. 

No doubt sovereign states do have 
the privilege of tellinig flatfooted 
lies when they want to — anyway, 
the custom is sanctioned by several 
thousand years of precedent — but 
it seems pretty childish to lie about 
something that can be readily check- 
ed. 

No wonder all those U. N. dele- 
gates looked so haggard I Probably 
they were thanking about what a 
little “open sky” surveillance can do 
to diplomacy over the next few years 
— and realizing that technological 
unemployment may be reaching out 
to claim another hatch of victims I

OCEAN ON TOP 



by HAL CLEMENT 



Illustrated by CASTELLON 

My \ob was simply to find and 
punish energy wasters — even 
at the bottom of the ocean! 



I ’ve never met a psychiatrist pro- 
less&anaily and don’t much want 
to, but just then I iraitheir wished 
thene was one around to talk to. It 
waan^ that I felt like cracking up; 
but when you have something pro- 
found to say, you lake to have it ap- 



preciated, and it would have taken 
a professional really to apprecitate 
the remark I wanted to make at that 
moment. 

There’s a word for people who 
can’t stand being out in the open 
with crowds staring at them,'* and 
there’s another one for those who 
get tali in a dither from being cramp-

ed into a small space. They’re both 
common enough ailments, but I 
would ihave liked to place a bet that 
no one before had ever suffered 
from agoraphobia and claustropho- 
bia simultaneously. 

With a name like mine, of course, 
I’ve never exactly sought the pub- 
lic eye, and usually I resist the temp- 
tation even to make ibright remarks 
in company. Just then, thougji, I 
was wishing there was someone to 
hear that diagnosis of my feeliings. 

Or maybe I was just wi^ng there 
was someone. 

I couldn’t hear the storm any 
more. The Pugnose had broken up 
almost where she was supposed to. 
She had hit the heavy weather just 
where the metro office had said she 
would, and her fuel had run out 
\Wthin five minutes of that time — 
thixt even I could have predicted; 
trust a Board boss to make sure 
Dio more stored energy than 
could possibly be helped went down 
with her. There was some battery 
power left, though, and I had kept 
a ruhning Loran check uinitiil she 
drifited as close to Point X as she was 
going to. This turned out to be about 
half a mile. When I saiw I was go- 
ing on past the key spot I blew the 
sqtdbs, and poor httle Pugnose 
started to come apart amidships. 

Shield never been intended for any 
other purpose, and I hadn’t fallen 
in love with her as some people 
Ddiglht have, but I didn’t like the 
slgM the same. It seemed waste- 
ful. I didrf t spend any time brooding 
over it, though. I ducked into the 
tank and sealed it and let nature 
tiiike its course. By now, if static 



pressure instruments could be trac- 
ed, the tank and I were eight hun- 
dred feet down. 

It was very, very quiet. I knew 
water was going by because the 
depth was increasing about two feet 
a second, but I couldn’t hear it. Any 
loose pieces of the boat were long 
gone, floatables being scattered over 
the Pacific and sinkables mostly pre- 
ceding me toward the bottom. I’d 
have been disturbed as well as sur- 
prised to hear anything solid bump 
against my particular bit of wreck- 
age. The sUence was good news, but 
it still made me uncomfortable. 

I ’d 'been in space once — a waste 
investigation at one of the 
Board’s fusion research stations — 
and there was the same complete 
lack of sound. I hadn’t liked ik then; 
it gave me the impression that the 
universe was deliberately snubbing 
me until the time would come to 
sweep up pay retmadns. I didn’t like 
it now, though the feeling was dif- 
fefeiit — this lime it wias as though 
someone were waitolhing carefully to 
see what I was up (to and was trjdng 
to make up has mind when to do 
something about it. A psychiatrist 
wouldn’t have been much help with 
that notion, of course, because there 
was a good chance that it was true. 

Bert Whelsrtrahl had disappeared 
in this volume of water a year be- 
fore. Joey Elfven, as competent an 
engineer and siubmariner as could be 
found on Earth, had been lost track 
of ten months later in the same 
neighborhood. They were both 
friends of mine, and I was bothered 
by their vanishing. 



OCEAN ON TOP 



7 




Six weeks ago, Marie Wladetzki 
had followed (the other two. Ihis was 
much worse from my point of view. 
She was not an investigator, of 
course — the Board, as personified 
by its present boss whose name I’ll 
leave out of this account, doesn’t 
believe women are objective enough 
— but that didn’t mean she 
couldn’t be curious. Also, she’d been 
as interested in Joey as I was in 
her. Being Marie, she hadn’t actual- 
ly broken the letter of any regula- 
tions when she took out a Board 
sub at Papeete, but she most cer- 
tainly strained the spirit of most of 
them. She hadn’t said where she 
was going and had last checked in 
between Pitcairn and Oejo a thou- 
sand miles from where I was now 
sinking with the remains of Pug- 
nose; but no one who knew her had 
any doubts about where to look 
first. 

The boss was human enough to 
volunteer me for the look-see. My 
own inclination would have been 
to do just that — take a sub and 
see what had happened; but brains 
won out. Bert’s disappearance could 
have been an accident, although 
there were already grounds for sus- 
picion about the Easter Island area. 
Joey’s vanishing within Half a dozen 
miles of the same spot could con- 
ceivably have been coincidence — 
the sea can still outguess man on 
occasion. After Marie’s loss, though, 
only a very stupid person would 
have gone barging into the region 
any more obviously than he could 
help. 

Therefore, I was now a thousand 
feet below the top of the Pacific 



and several times as far above the 
bottom, camouflaged as part of a 
wrecked boat. 

I didn’t know exactly how much 
water was still below me; even 
though my last fix on the surface had 
been pretty good and I’d acquired 
an excellent knowledge of the bot- 
tom contours north of Rapanui, I 
couldn’t be sure I was going straight 
down. Currents near an island are 
not the smooth, steady things sug- 
gested by those little arrows on 
small-scale maps of the Pacific. 

I might, of course, have tried 
echo-sounding, but to control that 
temptation I had no emission in- 
struments in the tank except flood- 
lights; and I had no intention of 
using even those until I had some 
assurance that I was alone. See 
without being seen was the current 
policy. The assurance would come, 
if ever, very much later, after I 
had reached the bottom and spent 
a good, long time listening. 

I n the meantime I watched the 
pressure gauge, which told how 
the water was piling up above me, 
and the sensors which would let 
me know if anyone else was using 
sonar gear in the neighborhood. I 
wasn’t sure whether I wanted them 
to react or not. If they did, it would 
be progress; I’d know someone was 
down here who shouldn’t be — but 
it might be the same sort of progress 
the other three had made. It might 
not be grounds for too much worry, 
since fifteen or twenty feet of 
smashed hull would show on any 
sonar scope for just what it was, 
and supposedly the tank inside would

not. Of course, some sonarmen are 
harder to fool than others. 

I could look out, of course. The 
tank had ports, and a couple of 
them faced the opening where Pug- 
nose*s stern used to be. I could even 
see things at times. There were 
flecks of phosphorescence diiMng 
upward and streaks of loiminosity 
not quite bright enough to identify 
in color wthich sometimes whipped 
past and vanished in the gloom and 
sometimes drifted for minutes in 
front of a port as though they mark- 
ed the position of something which 
was trying curiously to look in. I 
was tempted — not very strongly, 
but tempted — to turn on my lights 
once or twice to see what the things 
were. 

The wreckage was tumbling slow- 
ly. I had been assured that this 
wouldn’t happen — that weight had 
been distributed so that the sharp 
prow would always point down and 
leave the tank on top when I ihit 
bottom — but there was no one to 
complain to. There also seemed to 
be nothing to do about it, and I 
began to wonder just what I could 
accomplish if the tank wound up in 
bottom ooze, or even on hard rock, 
with the wreckage on top of it. The 
thing had little enough maneuver- 
ability as it was. With very much 
extra weight, dropping ballast might 
not be enough to start me 'back 
toward the surface. 

I couldn’t shift my own weight 
enough to affect the tumbling at 
all. The tank’s inside diameter was 
only about six feet, and much of 
that volume was taken up by fixed 
apparatus. 



Some of my friends have shown 
a tendency to solve problems by 
doing nothing until the last possible 
moment. I’ve outlived most of them. 
Once I’d noticed the tumbling, it took 
me about five seconds to run through 
the possible actions. I could cut 
loose from the wreckage right now, 
exposing the nearly spherical form 
of the tank to anyone who was 
watching with a good sonar — 
though no one had been so far. I 
could turn on the lights so as to see 
the bottom before I hit and, hope- 
fully, still separate in time if it 
proved necessary; that would also 
be inconsistent with the conceal- 
ment plan. I could sit and hope I 
would land in the right attitude in 
spite of the tumbling — that is, do 
nothing. That might mean that I 
would have to argue for my life 
with the laws of nature, which are 
harder to convince than most hu- 
man opponents. 

The first two choices meant — 
well, maybe Bert and Joey and Marie 
were still alive. I reached for the 
light switch. 

I didn’t touch it, though. All of a 
sudden I could see the bottom any- 
way. 

At least, it looked as though it 
ought to be the bottom. It was in 
the right direction — I could still 
tell up from down — and it seemed 
flat. And it was visible. 

II 

1 didn’t believe it, of course. I’m 
a very conservative person who 
likes even his fiction realistic, and 
this was too much to swallow. I had

to stop reading The Maracot Deep 
when I was young because it de- 
scribed a luminous ocean bottom. I 
know Conan Doyle had never been 
down and needed the light for story 
purposes and didn’t have very high 
standards of consistency anyway, but 
it still bothered me. I knew he was 
wrong for the same reason everyone 
does — the bottom just isn’t bright. 

Only now it was. 

The tumbling wreck was swinging 
me upward away from the light, and 
I had time to decide whether I 
should believe my eyes or not. I 
could still read instruments. The 
pressure dial gave a direct depth of 
four thousand eight hundred eighty 
feet; a quick mental correction from 
the record tape of the thermograph 
added another two hundred or so. I 
certainly should be near the bottom, 
somewhere on the northern slopes 
of the mountain whose peaks are 
Rapanui. 

I swung gently over the top and 
back down the other side, and my 
line of sight pointed downward 
again. Whether I wanted to believe 
my eyes or not, they insisted there 
was light in that direction. It was 
a gentle yellow-green glow — just 
the sort of thing you use in lighting 
effects to give the impression of on 
underwater scene. At first it looked 
uniform and smooth; then, a few 
turns later and two hundred feet 
lower, it showed a pattern. The pat- 
tern was of squares, with their cor- 
ners just a little brighter than the 
rest of the area. It didn’t cover the 
whole bottom; its edge was almost 
below me, and it extended toward 
what I thought was the north. 



though my compass wasn’t reacting 
too well to the tumbling. In the 
other direction was the normal com- 
forting and frightening darkness — 
that was real enough. 

Two things happened at almost 
the same instant. It became evident 
that I was going to come down 
pretty close to the edge of the light 
area, and it also became obvious 
what the light area was. The second 
realization got to me. For three or 
four seconds I was so furious and 
disgusted that I couldn’t plan, and 
as a result I almost didn’t get around 
to telling this story. 

The light was artificial. Believe 
it if you can. 

I realize that for a normal person 
it’s hard. Wasting watts to light up 
the outdoors is bad enough, but 
sometimes it’s a sad necessity. 
Spending power to illuminate the 
sea bottom, though — well, as I 
say, for a few moments I was too 
furious to think straight. My job 
has brought me into contact with 
people who were careless with en- 
ergy, with people who stole it, and 
even with people who misused it; but 
this was a brand new dimension! 
I was lower now and could see 
acres and acres of light stretching 
off to the north, east, and west un- 
til it blurred out of sight. Acres and 
acres lighted by things suspended 
a few yards above the level bottom, 
things visible only as black specks 
in the center of slightly brighter 
areas. At least, whoever was respon- 
sible for this display had some sense 
of economy; he was using reflectors. 

Then I got my anger under con- 
trol, or maybe my fear did it for me. 



10 



IF 




I siiddemly realiized itihiait 1 was only 
a few dozen yaids laibove the ligjbts. 
1 was not goang to come down 
among them, but a little to the south. 
I couidfi’t say safely to the south. 
I couldn’t say safely anything, be- 
cause my assemblage of Pugnose- 
bow and safety tank was turning 
over slowly enough to let me predict 
the attitude it would have when it 
hit bottom, and it looked pretty cer- 
tain that the open end of the huiU 
would be underneath. 

Q uite aside from the fact that I 
wouldn’t be able to see any- 
thing from under the wreckage, 
there was the likelihood that I 
wouldn’t be able to do anything 
either — such as get back to the 
surface. This time I did reach the 
controls. 

Since the whole idea hinged on 
concealment, the separators used 
springs rather than squibs. I waited 
until the spin put the hulk between 
me and the light and punched the 
botton. The push was light enough 
to make me wonder for a few sec- 
onds whether I mightn’t he in even 
worse trouble than I’d supposed. 
Then light began to come in through 
ports which had been covered by 
the hull, and that worry ended. The 
springs had kicked the tank aiway 
from the lighted region, so I could 
see Pugnose*s bow outlined against 
the luminescence. The separation 
had slowed our flaU very slightly 
with the wrecfcage now going just a 
trifle faster than I was. At least 
something was going as planned; 



the wreck would hit first, so there 
should be no chance of my getting 
trapped under it. 

I hadn’t expected to see it hit 
bottom, of course. I would certainly 
never have expected to see what 
happened when it did. 

For the most part, level stretches 
of sea bottom tend to be on the 
gooey side. They may call it gk>bl- 
gerina ooze or radiolarian ooze, 
but it’s usually obze. You can meet 
with coral and sand and other firr- 
stuff in shallow water and honest 
rock at times on slopes, but whe-e 
it’s level you expect something like 
a cross between ordinary mud and 
the top couple of inches of a stagnant 
pond. When something hard and 
heavy lands on it, even gently, you 
don’t expect the bottom to give it 
much suppKWi:. You may sometimes 
be surprised on this matter, but you 
never count on anything bouncing 
off the sea bottom. 

Pugnose didn’t exactly bounce, I 
have to admit, but she certainly 
didn’t behave properly. She hit the 
lighted surface thirty or forty yards 
from the edge, and perhaps twice as 
far from me. I could see easily. She 
touched, as expected, and sank in 
as expected. There was no swirl of 
silt, though — no sign of the slow- 
motion splash you normally see 
when something lands in the ooze. 
Instead, the bow section disappeared 
almost completely into the smooth 
surface while a circular itpple grew 
around it and spread laway from the 
point of impact. Then the wreckage 
eased gently back up until it was 
half uncovered, then back down

again, still in slow motion. It osdl- 
laited tftiait wiay tihree or four itknes 
before coming to rest, and eacih re- 
bound sent another ripple spreading 
out from the spot for a dozen yards 
or so. 

By the time that stopped, so had 
my tank. I felt it hit something hard 
— rock, for a bet, and I’d have 
won. Then it began to roll very, Very 
gently toward the light. I couldn’t 
see the surface I was on at all clear- 
ly, but it seemed evident that it was 
a sohd slope which would deliver 
me beside the Pugnose in two or 
three minutes if I didn’t do some- 
thing about it. Fortunately, there 
was something I could do. 

The tank had what we’d come 
to call legs, six-foot4ong telescop- 
ing rods of metal which could be 
extended by springs and retracted 
again by solenoids. I was still hoping 
not to have to use magnets, but it 
seemed that the legs were in order; 
I propped out four of them in what 
I hoped were reasonable directions. 
Enough of the guesses were right to 
stop the roliinig, and for the first 
time I had a steady observing plat- 
form. NaturaMy, I concentrated on 
the area I could see. 

I was now below the level of the 
lights themselves. They appeared 
to 'be strung on lines at intervals of 
about twenty yards, with the same 
spacing between lines. That was a 
guess, though, since I couldn’t actual- 
ly see any supports. Their regularity 
bolstered the guess, though the fact 
that the wreck -had come down just 
about on a line between two of the 
lights without appearing to disturb 



them counted rather against it. 1 
wasn’t too stuprised to see nothing 
growing or moving on the flat sur- 
face they illuminated, though of 
course I wouldn’t have been sur- 
prised to see a few tracks or holes 
scattered around. 

At least, I wouldn’t have been 
surprised at them if I’d not seen 
the Pugnose*s landing. With that to 
go by, it was perfectly clear that 
whatever I was looking at was not 
sea bottom. It was more like a rub- 
ber sheet stretched like a tent roof 
over everything more than about ten 
feet down slope from me. The wreck 
had dented it but hadn’t punotured 
it, and the stuff was strong enough 
to hold up the comparatively small 
submerged weight of metal plas- 
tic. 

This, I reflected, could be useful. 
I had no idea why whoever was un- 
der the tent wanted to light up the 
outside, -but unless the fabric were 
completely opaque they could hard- 
ly help seeing the shadow and the 
dent in their ceiling. That should 
bring people to investigate, and they 
would be easy to see without my 
having to use lights of my own and 
giving myself away. All I needed 
was one clear view of unauthorized 
human beings at the bottom of the 
Pacific; that, plus the scale of energy 
wastage I could already detail, would 
be all my report would need — a 
major control expedition would do 
the rest. No one expected me to 
arrest a group large enough to set 
up an instaMation like this, and I had 
no ambition that way either. To put 
it mildly, the tank wasn’t maneuver- 
able enough to serve as a police oar;

I W;as in no position to arrest a 
passing shrimp. All I asked was a 
good look at a work sub, or a suit 
of pressure armor, or even a han- 
dling robot under remote control — 
anything that would show that this 
setup was being actively managed — 
one good look, and I’d be ready to 
drop ballast. 

I wouldn’t do it too hastily, of 
course, for two good reasons. A 
sonarman might reasonably dismiss 
a sinking object as a piece of a 
wrecked ship, or even a dead whale, 
and not be too curious; but he would 
be most unlikely to feel the same 
indifference toward something ris- 
ing. I’d have to take some time to 
evaluate the sonar danger. It was 
nice, but not conclusive, that there 
had been no sign of it so far. 

The other reason against haste I 
didn’t know about yet, and didn’t 
learn for a number of hours. 

I ’m not a clock-watcher. I knew 
I had plenty of survival time in 
the tank and wasn’t keeping very 
close track of how much of it had 
passed. When the second reason did 
show up it never occurred to me to 
check the time, and for several 
hours after that I was very thorough- 
ly distracted from such things as 
clocks. I can’t say, therefore, just 
how long I spent sitting in the tank 
waiting for something to happen. 
I can guarantee that it was a num- 
ber of hours; long enough to get me 
bored, cramped, irritated and more 
than half convinced that there was 
no one under that tent roof any- 
where nearby. The idea that it might 
be someone who didn’t care a hoot 



about fragments of ship in his ceil- 
ing seemed too far out to be worth 
considering; if anyone had seen it, 
he’d have done something about it. 

No one had done anything about 
it. Therefore, no one was within 
sight. And if no one was within 
sight under the fabric, I might as 
well take a closer look at it myself. 
Maybe I could even get a look under 
it. 

Dangerous thinking, boy. Don’t 
let all those wasted kilowatts go to 
your head. You’re just a detached 
eyeball; if you don’t get back with 
information, anything you do man- 
age to do is pure waste — and waste, 
of course, is the profane word 
around the Board. 

It was a temptation, though. No 
motion — no sign of human life ex- 
cept the lights and the tent roof it- 
self, and mighty little sign of any 
other kind of life. No sound. Noth- 
ing from the sonar frequency moni- 
tor. Why shouldn’t I roll gently 
down to the edge of the fabric and 
study it more closely? 

The best answer to that question, 
of course, was that it would be the 
act of a dithering idiot. As time 
went on, though, it occurred to me 
once or twice that merely being 
here at all wasn’t the highest possi- 
ble display of human intelligence. If 
I must act like a fool, I might as 
well be a real one. I don’t know 
where that sort of thinking comes 
from; maybe I should see that 
psychiatrist. 

I’m not sure just how close I 
came to giving in. I know I almost 
pulled in the legs three times and 
each time thought better of it.

IF 




The first time I was stopped by 
something moving, which turned out 
to be a fair-sized shark. It was the 
first large living thing I’d seen since 
readiing bottom, and it set my 
thoughts off on another tangent for 
a wfliile. The next couple of times I 
started to move the tank I was 
stopped by the memory of the shark; 
it had disappeared — had it heard 
something I couldn’t, that had 
frightened it off? I had no instru- 
ments outside for low or audible fre- 
quency detection, just" the sonar re- 
ceptors. 

I know all this isn’t making me 
sound much like a genius, or even a 
reasonably competent operator. I 
wish I’d had more time to edit my 
memories a bit before having to tell 
this story. If I’m to justify the de- 
cision I’m trying to sell, I should 
have some chance to look like a 
sensible adult first. Ail I can put in 
for my own defense at the moment 
is one of those let’s-see-you-do-better 
remarks. Are you sure just how 
your own thoughts would have gone 
if you were practically helpless in a 
sht-foot plastic bubble a mile under 
the ocean? If you’re not, please 
suspend your critcism until I’m done. 

T ie second reason for not dump- 
ing ballast too hastily finally 
did show up. My attention was still 
pretty well focused on the wreckage, 
so I didn’t see it coming. My first 
glimpse was from the comer of my 
eye, and I thought for an instant 
h was another shark; then I realized 
it was human, and I had my evi- 
dence. Fine. Once it’s out of sight I 
can head for the surface. 



Not a chance. What I needed was 
convincing evidence, and if my own 
eyes weren’t convincing me it was 
unlikely that my words would con- 
vince anyone else. What I saw was a 
person, which was all right in itself; 
a suit of four-inch polyphase armor, 
adequately powered in the limbs, 
will hold back the ton and a quarter 
or so per square inch that sea water 
exerts a mile down. Such armor will 
even let the wearer look rather like 
a human being and move about in a 
very clumsy walk. 

It will not, however, unless he is 
immersed in an ocean of mercury, 
let him swim; and this clearly hu- 
man figure was swimming. 

It came into view some distance to 
my left, appearing in the light rather 
suddenly as though it had come 
down from the darkness above. It 
was swimming toward me and the 
wreck, not in any obvious hurry. As 
it approached, details became plain- 
er; and the plainest of all — plainer 
even than the fact that it was fe- 
male — was that she wasn’t wearing 
armor. She was wearing a cold-water 
coverall type scuba suit, absoluitely 
ordinary except that it had a spheri- 
cal, itransparent helmet instead of a 
breathing mask, and the ballast 
seemed to be in rings here and there 
around body and limbs instead of be- 
ing fastened to the belt. I repeat — 
in fact, I had to repeat it to myself 
several times — that the garment 
was not pressure armor. Its wearer’s 
swimming motions showed plainly 
that it was nearly as flexible as or- 
dinary skin, just as a scuba suit 
should be. 

She didn’t seem to see my tank. 



OCEAN ON TOP 



15 




wMdi was some relief. She didn’t 
even seem to see the wreok until 
she was wsthm twenty yards of it 
She had been swimming very slow- 
ly along the edge of the tent roof 
wiiith no more apparent purpose than 
someone out for an afternoon stroll, 
up to that point. Then she changed 
course and headed straight for the 
bow of Pugnose. 

That didn’t fit. Anyone down 
here should have been looking for 
that wreck, not running across it by 
accident. I’d been expecting a work- 
ing party sent out by the people un- 
der that cover. 

Well, there’s more than one thing 
1 haven’t been expecting about this 
business. Stop with the working 
hypotheses, brother, you haven’t 
enough data even for tot yet. Just 
watch (I don’t even address myself 
by name). 

So I watched. I watched her swim 
around the shattered bow, and into 
it and out again, and over it. Then 
I watched her unlimiber an object 
which turned out to be a light, which 
bad been dipped to her suit belt, and 
swim inside once more. That 
woiried me a little; the camouifilage 
for the tank had not been designed 
for that sort of inspection. Its 
clamps, its launching springs — 

She came out again, with no more 
visible signs of excitement than be- 
fore, and at that point something 
else dawned on me. It was a very 
minor point compared with what I 
had. already seen — at least, it 
seemed minor when I first noticed 
it; as I thought, it became more and 
more a major puzzle. 

Her scuba suit was, as I said, 



quite ordinary except for helmet 
and ballast. Its ordinariness included 
a small tank between the shoulders, 
whose upper end just touched the 
helmet and was presumably connect- 
ed with it, though I could see no 
piping. All this was reasonable. The 
jarring note was that there were no 
bubbles. 

N ow, I’m familiar with rebreather 
systems, and 1 know about 
chemical supplies — mixtures of 
alfcaM metal peroxides and super- 
oxides which react with water to 
give free oxygen and pick up car- 
bon dioxide. I know them well 
enough to know that they must 
have, besides the chemical container 
and mixer systems, a sort of “lung” 
— a variable-vol'ume, ambientnpres- 
sure gas bag or tank — with the 
supply chemicals between it and the 
user’s own lungs. The exhaled gas 
has to go somewhere until it’s 
ready to be inhaled again. That 
“lung” must have a volume great 
enough to take aU the air a swim- 
mer can exhale at one breath — in 
other words it must have as much 
volume, or nearly as much, as his 
own inflated lungs. There was no 
such bag visible on this swimming 
outfit, and the back tank was not 
nearly ilarge enough to have con- 
tained one. It seemed, therefore, tot 
the unit did not involve a chemical 
oxygen supply; and unless some sort 
of microscopic pump was taking the 
gas as fast as she exhaled and 
squeezing it back into another part 
of that httle tank at fantastically 
high pressure, there should be ex- 
halant bubbles. I couldn’t see any 



u 



IF 




reason for such a recovery system, 
but I couldn’t see any bubbles either. 
I had already been bothered about 
what gas mixture she could be 
breathing — at this pressure, half of 
one per cent oxygen would have 
burn^ her lungs out, and there was 
nothing I knew of which could be 
used to dilute it. Even helium was 
soluble enough down here to make 
decompression a job of many hours. 

It crossed my mind for a mo- 
ment that people might be living 
permanently under this pressure, 
breathing a nearly- pure helium 
atmosphere with a fraction of a per 
cent oxygen in it; but if that were 
the story, I still couldn’t see why 
that girl’s suit didn’t give out bub- 
bles. Granted there might be every 
economic reason to recover helium, 
there are engineering problems 
which I still don’t think could be 
completely solved. 

No. All hypotheses inadequate. 
Keep on observing. Facts so far are 
only that she seems to be living 
and moving normally in a closed 
system at outside pressure, and that 
the pressure in question — skipping 
the old superstition about flattening 
a human body — is quite high 
enough to mess up any biophysical 
or biochemical processes involving 
gas dynamics. 

There wasn’t much more to ob^ 
serve, though. The girl clipped the 
k^t back on her belt, took a last 
glance at the wreckage and began 
swimming away from it. She didn’t 
go back the way she had come, but 
continued on to my right, slanting 
away ‘from the lighted region. In a 
few seconds she had disappeared, 

OCEAN ON TOP 



though 1 knew she couldn’t be very 
far away yet. 

I t seemed likely that she was oiff to 
get help in moving the wreck 
off the tent roof. How long before 
she would be back with it was any- 
one’s guess. There might be a tent 
entrance a few hundred yards away, 
or there might not be one for sever- 
al miles. The former seemed a trifle 
more likely, but I wasn’t going to 
risk money on the question. 

Just my future. 

She might have noticed the gear 
that had held and launched my 
tank; she wouldn’t have had to be 
much of an actress to hide an ex- 
pression of suspicion under the cir- 
cumstances. If she had noticed and 
reported it, those who came with 
her were going to be very curious 
about the whole area. The outside 
of the tank was deliberately a little 
irregular in outline so that it 
wouldn’t be too obviously artificial, 
but it was not going to fool anyone 
who took a really good look at it. 
Maybe it would be better if I moved 
a little farther away. I wasn’t con- 
cerned with personal safety; I could 
always get away, but I wanted to 
see as much as possible before that 
became necessary. 

So I told myself. 

Moving would be a slow process; 
traveling ability was not really a 
design feature of the tank. There 
were two dozen of the legs, and I 
had enough stored power to retract 
them against their springs several 
thousand times (that had taken argu- 
ment), but I had not been bom a 
sea urchin. I had had a 'httle prac- 

17 




tice roliing the thing aitxyiiiid under 
WBSb&Ty but the purpose of the lig 
to let me juggHe into a better 
observing position, not to keep out 
of ilbe way of seardhers. If I were 
foimd, my only real recourse would 
be to drop ballast and start for the 
surface. That was a once-only opera- 
tion, and I didn’t want to resort to 
it before I really had to. There was 
stUl some hope, I figured, of de- 
ciding what was going on down 
here in some detail. 

Maybe it’s courage, or maybe just 
natural optimism. 

in 

T began working the legs, hoping 
X^lhat no infittiruments in the neigji- 
bpdhood were reoordang the D.C. 
pulses as I turned the retraction 
solenoids on and off. I had found 
during practice that I could climb 
a slope of five or six degrees if the 
bottom were hard enough to give 
the “feet” any resistance, but that 
near the limit of steepness the going 
tended to be tricky. If I overbailanced 
and started downhill again it took 
very fast work with just the right 
legs to stop the roll. The sphere had 
a respectable moment of inertia. Be- 
cause of its outer irregularity, some 
positions were naituiUally more stable 
than others, and some were mudi 
less. Just now 1 was wishing that 1 
bad spent more time in practice, 
though I consoled myself with the 
thought that the boss wouldn’t have 
authorized the energy expenditure 
anyway. 

I had worked my way between 
thirty and forty yards farther up 



the slope, with only one mistake 
that cost me any real distance, when 
the party I expected showed up. 

It wasn’t a large one — four in 
all. One could have been, and 
probably was, the giil I had seen 
before; the other three seemed to 
be men, though it was hard to tell 
at this greater distance. One of the 
new ones was towing a piece of 
equipment about three feet long, 
cylindrical in shape, and a little more 
than a foot in diameter. It had a 
slight negative buoyancy, which was 
understandable — they’d make sure 
that nothing which got loose would 
find its way to the sunface. 

They swam over to the wreck, 
and two of them began pulling 
lengths of hne from the cylinder. 
They attaCihed these to convenient 
parts of Pugnose, while the third 
man pulled from ithe other end of the 
cylinder something that looked like 
a heavy bundle of netting with a 
collapsi^ balloon inside ift. When the 
other lines were made fast he ma- 
nipulaited something on the cylinder, 
and the balloon began to infiaite 
slowly. The wreckage didn’t have 
much submerged weight, and it 
wasn^ long before the balloon had 
it hoisted dear of the roof. Then 
all four of them got on the far side 
and began pushing it, swim fins flut- 
tering violently. 

It took them several minutes to 
get it away from the smooth area 
and out of the light. I supposed this 
was all they’d bother to do, but I was 
wrong. With the tent roof out of 
danger they moved airound and be- 
gan pushing the load in the direc- 
tion the girl went after finding it.

IP 




This might be a nuisiance. Maybe 
tbey just wanted it for a souvenir, 
but maybe they wanted to make 
a really dose examination under 
better conditions — better light, or 
maybe even out of water. Which- 
ever of these might be true, as long 
as they were interested someone was 
likely to notice the tank attachments. 
I’d have been much happier if they’d 
simply pushed the bow section off 
their roof and forgotten it. Now I 
bad no excuse for not following to 
learn more about them. Come to 
think of it, I should try to locate 
the entrance, or one of the en- 
trances, to the place anyway. 

They weren’t swimniing fast, but 
they went a lot faster than I could 
roU the tank. Once again I wished 
that some real provision for moving 
the thing had been made, but the 
argument had been that the closer 
the whole rig got to being a sub- 
marine, the harder it was going to 
be to camouflage. I hadn’t bought 
the argument completely at the time, 
and I would have been even more 
delighted at a chance to reopen it 
now. All I could do, though, was 
hope the chance would come later 
on, and in the meantime wait until 
the swimmers got their burden a 
reasonable distance away and then 
start rolling in the same direction. 

P erhaps I haven’t made clear 
quite all the nuisances involved 
in rolling the tank. The principle 
ought to be plain enough; it was 
simply a matter of letting the ap- 
propriate spring push out a leg 
against the bottom, on the side I 
wanted to go away from. It may not 



have crossed your mind that thii 
general method of getting around 
meant that living equipment, oon- 
trol panels, and other fixed gear 
were sometimes to one side of me, 
sometimes to another, and some- 
times above or below. There were 
times when it was very hard to keep 
from sitting on -all the leg-oontrol 
buttons at once, for example. As 
I’ve said, the legs were meant more 
for position and attitude fine con- 
trol, and to keep the tank from roll- 
ing on a slope, than for genuine 
travel. The need for the latter had 
not been foreseen, or at least hadn’t 
been considered very great, by the 
authorities. 

At least, concentrating on work- 
ing the machine along the bottom 
kept my mind from the worries I’d 
felt on the way down. It was actual- 
ly more likely now that I’d come 
under unfriendly observation, but at 
least I wasn’t brooding over it. The 
swimmers had vanished in the dis- 
tance, nothing else could be seen 
moving in the lighted area to my 
left, and nothing at all could be 
seen the other way. The bottom un- 
der the tank couldn’t be made out in 
detail, and in a way I was groping 
along — though the verb isn’t ex- 
actly right, since it implies that you 
can feel what’s ahead of you. I 
couldn’t feel anything; I could only 
note whether my vehicle rolled a 
little way, a longer way, or not at 
-all whenever another leg was ex- 
tended. When it didn’t roll at all I 
had to guess which other legs to try. 
It would have been a lot easier if I 
had dared to use enough light of my 
own to get a decent sight of the

bottom, but I wasn’t tbat silly. If 
the local (population anduided swim- 
mers, I didn’t tiave a prayer of know- 
ing when any of ithem were around; 
when this mess had started we were 
thinikiing of subs and sonar. These I 
was ready to spot 

The slope wias not very regular, 
as I quickly found. Twice I rolled 
forward out of control for several 
yards when I reached a small dip. 
0nce 1 thought I was stuck for good 
— I couldn’t go forward, back or 
what was presumably downhill 
toward the light. As a last resort I 
tried uphill and found that it wasn’t 
litphill at aU; I rolled out of con- 
trol again into a hohow where I 
couldn’t see the lighted area except 
as a vague, diffused glow over the 
ridge I’d just crossed. Getting out of 
that hollow used a lot of time and 
an irritating amount of stored 
power. 

I couldn’t even relieve my feel- 
ings with language. The coupling 
from air through plastic to water, 
and from water through helmets to 
gas and human ears, may be pretty 
bad, but it isn’t zero; and the sound- 
transmitting properties of cold water 
make up for a lot of matching de- 
ficiencies. I didn’t dare say a word. 

Once out of that devil4nvented 
guHy I stopped, once more in full 
sight of the tent roof and tried to 
take stock. 

My power was rather low. There 
was no way of teiQiLng whether I 
migibt reach the entrance in three 
hundred yards or three thousand; 
the former seemed more Mkely, since 
the . girl hadn’t taken too long to 
come back with her help, but then 



she might have met the men already 
outside. Nothing was certain enough 
to give any possible line of action 
even the dignity of a calculated risk. 
It wasn’t possible to calculate. 

I had to find out more, though. 
I’d cooled down a little from my 
original reaction — I could believe 
what I’d seen, and I realized that 
others would, too — but the nows 
I had wasn’t as <heilpf ul as it was 
supposed to be to the Board. If a 
police unit were to do anything but 
grope around, it should know where 
to start. A regular entrance would 
make a logical place. Of course it 
wasn’t likely that the tent roof would 
really keep a suib out; but judging 
by i^e area the tent enclos^, the 
chances of brealdnig through at a 
strategioally useful point would be 
rather slim. 

Maybe the best thing to do would 
be to throw out the caution policy 
and turn on my lights. The extra 
power would be offset by more ef- 
ficient travel when I could see where 
I was going and I should stand a 
better chance of reaching the en- 
trance before my juice failed entirely 
and automatically let my ballast go. 
If I were seen, no doubt some of 
the swimmers would come close 
enough to give me a really good 
look, so I might get a better idea of 
their high-pressure technique before 
I left. 

I ’m a cautious man by nature, and 
thought that one over for quite 
a while before I bought it. There 
was plenty against it, of course. Just 
because all I’d seen was swimmers 
rather than subs didn’t prove there 



20 



IF 




weren’t any subs. If there were, 
there would be an excellenit ohance 
that I could never get hack to the 
surface — but I’d accepted that risk 
before starting the trip. I pinig-pong- 
ed the matter for several minutes. 
Then I took a good, deep breath on 
the theory that I might not get many 
more and turned on one of my 
spots. 

It made a difference, all right. The 
bottom was mostly rock, as I’d sus- 
pected, and was very rough — no 
wonder I’d had trouble using my legs 
effectively. Able to watch wihat I 
was doing, I resumed travel and, as 
I’d hoped, made much better speed 
with much less power drain. It wasn’t 
exactly easy yet; I was still rolling, 
and had to change lights as well as 
legs now as I rolled, but the im- 
provement was encouraging. 

I could also see more motion 
around me. There was a lot of small 
life — shrimps and their relatives — 
that I hadn’t been able to spot be- 
fore. They got out of my way with- 
out being too distracting. There were 
also plantlike growths, though con- 
sidering how far they were from 
the nearest natural light it seemed 
likely that they were sponges or 
something of that sort. They neither 
helped nor hampered the rolling, as 
far as I could tell. 

However, I was paying for the 
much better short-range vision with 
a much worse view of distant ob- 
jects. I might have been siirprised 
quite easily by a group of swim- 
mers, but what actually happened 
was less predictable. I lost orienta- 
tion. 

Not in the compass-direction 



sense and not completely. I could 
still see the lighted area to my left, 
though not as well as before; my 
compass still worked, when it hap- 
pened to be right side up; but my 
sense of up and down, depending 
more on my view of a few square 
yards of ocean bottom than on my 
semicircular canals, was fooled when 
some of the bottom ceased to be 
horizontal. 

The change must have been 
gradual, or I’d have spotted it with- 
in the small area I could see well. 
As it was, I overlooked it completely; 
suddenly I was on on area of rock 
sloping much more steeply than any 
I had traversed up to then. Before I 
knew it the tank had started a stately 
roll to the left; after I knew it, leg 
afiter leg poked out in that general 
direction proved useless. 

It wasn’t like rolling downhill in 
a 'barrel; it was a slow and grace- 
ful motion. I could easily have stay- 
ed upright inside the tank if I’d 
chosen to concentrate on that prob- 
lem instead of on ithe controls. For 
all the use I got out of the latter, I 
might as well have concentrated on 
comfort. Some of the legs may have 
slowed me a little, but none of them 
came close to putting a stop to the 
journey. I rolled helplessly into the 
lighted region and out onto the tent 
foibric. For several long seconds my 
report-smoking attention was divided 
almost equally between up and 
down. 

Above me I could see the 'lights 
clearly for the first time. They were 
ordinary high-pressure, excited-vapor 
lamps, bigger than I’d ever seen used 
for general illumination, but other-

wise nothing strange. I still couldn’t 
see what held them in position, since 
looking up at them was hard on the 
eyes. 

Looking down was harder on the 
imagination, though mine was getting 
a bit calloused. I already knew that 
the fabric was remarkably strong 
and elastic; I’d seen how it reacted 
to Pugnose's bow, which must have 
had some pretty sharp corners here 
and there. I also knew that it was 
opaque, or at best translucent, in its 
normal state. I realized that the 
part now under my tank would be 
stretched. But it hadn’t occurred to 
me that stretching the stuff would 
make it transparent. 

IV 

W hen I stopped moving, how- 
ever, I could see ordinary sea 
lK»ttom — rock similar to the stuff 
1 had been rolling across*^ under 
me. For a moment I thought some- 
thing must have stopped me short 
of the tent roof after all, but glances 
through several of the ports killed 
that notion. I was nearly fifty yards 
out on the thing, sunk into it for 
just about half the diameter of the 
tank. From ports above that level I 
could see the lights above and the 
smooth fabric below; from the lower 
windows I could make out rock and 
occasional patches of sht on the 
bottom and a greenish-^hite, evenly 
glowing oeilinig above — evidently 
the fabric, lighted from the other 
side. It was translucent, then; but 
ilhe part of it stretched around the 
lower half of the tank offered no in- 
terference at all to vision. Some of 



the legs were extended on this side, 
and the stuff seemed to have spread 
in an invisibly thin film over these 
as well — they could hardly have 
punctured it or I wouldn’t have been 
hanging on the roof. Someone must 
have done some very fancy work in 
molecular architecture, I decided — 
which shows how a wildly wrong set 
of premises can at times give rise to 
a correct conclusion. 

But why the tent at all? The sea 
bottom under it looked no different 
from that above. There was no sign 
of any human being or artificial 
structure in the region below. There 
weren’t even any living beings that 
I could see, and I certainly looked 
hard — it occurred to me for a mo- 
ment that someone might have gone 
so far with the energy-wasting busi- 
ness as to try growing natural foods 
with artificial light. The idea at least 
went along with indifference to or- 
dinary morality about energy; peo- 
ple who’d shine all those kilo- 
watts into the ocean probably- 
wouldn’t boggle at overreaching 
their fair share of area in order to 
grow mustard or something like that. 
The sea bottom was about the only 
place on Barth where such a trick 
could be pulled without being caught 
right away by indignant neighbors, 
to say nothing of the Board. The 
only trouble with the theory, other 
than one’s natural reluctance to be- 
lieve in such people, was that I 
couldn’t see anything growing. For 
that matter, I didn’t know what sort 
of food plant could be grown under 
sea water. There were some, no 
doubt; and if there weren’t natural 
ones, there is always gene tailoring.

IF 




A more immediate question was 
what to do next. Thirty seconds of 
trying proved that I could extend 
and retract my legs until the power 
cells ran down without moving the 
tank at all. They just didn’t have 
anything to push against; the bottom 
was a little too far down. I tried 
rolling the thing by shifting my 
weight. This worked as far as turning 
the tank over was concerned, but 
didn’t get me noticeably closer to 
“shore.” It seemed that the only 
freedom of motion I had left was 
upward. 

This was a little annoying. I had 
planned to plant a small sonar trans- 
ponder near the entrance when I 
found it, as a guide for the police 
boats. If I dropped it here, it would 
mean very little and furthermore 
would be seen lying on the tent fab- 
ric by the first person who happened 
to pass, either above or below. If 
I’d had the reaction time and fore- 
sight of a fictional hero I might have 
let one go when I realized I was 
out of control; but I hadn’t, and 
there was no use moaning about it. 

I might wait until they found the 
tank and just hope for a chance to 
drop the instrument without any- 
one’s noticing while they were cart- 
ing me off, but that seemed to in- 
volve a historical record for opti- 
mism. 

I couldn’t accept the idea of go- 
ing back to the surface without leav- 
ing it, though, even though that and 
all the other things it would be so 
nice to get done seemed to be im- 
possible. Even a snake on a tray of 
oiled ball bearings keeps wriggling. 

And so I remained. There was 



really no point in an early departure 
anyway. I still had plenty of oxygen, 
and there was always the hope that 
I’d get a useful idea before they 
— whoever “they” were — found 
me. The hope lasted for nearly six 
hours. 

I t wasn’t a girl this time, though 
it might possibly have been one 
' of the same men. He wore the same 
sort of swimming outfit to the last 
detail, as far as I could see. He was 
swimming straight toward me when 
I first saw him , above the tent roof 
as the others had been, slanting out 
of the darkness from the direc- 
tion I supposed the entrance must 
lie. Cert^nly he had seen me, or 
rather the tank. I wished I had 
spotted him earlier — it would be 
interesting, and might even be use- 
ful, to know whether I had been 
found accidentally by a passing swim- 
mer or by someone deliberately 
checking the region where the wreck- 
ed boat had been found. However, 
I could be philosophical about not 
knowing. I watched as he swam over- 
head. 

He should be able to recognize 
the tank without much trouble. It 
had a lot of nonstandard equipment 
fastened outside, but it was basically 
a regular emergency high-pressure 
escape tank of the sort you’d find 
in any large submarine — a sphere 
of silica fiber and high-stress poly- 
mer able to stand the pressure of 
two miles of sea water. It was light 
enough to float, ordinarily, but the 
jury-rigged thing I was in was well 
ballasted. Besides the legs and their 



OCEAN ON TOP 



23 




accessory gear there were the lights, 
the transponders, sundry pieces of 
sensing equipment and several slabs 
of lead so distributed as to keep the 
center of buoyancy and the geometri- 
cal center as close together as prac- 
tical. The lead made the real differ- 
ence; I would stiU float with all the 
rest. 

The swimmer stopped stroking as 
he glided overhead and drifted, 
settling slowly toward me. I could 
see his face now through the helmet 
— in fact, the helmet itself was 
barely noticeable; he might almost 
have been swimming bareheaded. He 
was no one I could remember ever 
having seen before in five years of 
Board work, but I took good note 
of the line of his black hair, the 
set of his eyes, and the squarish 
outline of the rest of his face so 
as to be sure of knowing him again 
if the chance ever came up. Pre- 
sumably he couldn”t see me; the 
view ports were small, my inside 
lights were out, and he showed no 
sign of the surprise I would have 
expected him to feel if he knew 
or guessed that the tank contained a 
living man. 

He came close enough to touch 
the equipment — so close that I 
could no longer see everything he 
was doing. I told myself that it 
couldn’t be anything very drastic, 
considering what the tank was built 
to take, but I’d still have been 
much happier if I could have seen 
his hands all the time. He was cer- 
tainly fooling with things; I could 
feel the casing quiver occasionally 
as he pushed something particularly 
hard. 



He drew away again and swam 
twice more all around the tank, 
never taking his eyes from it Iheq 
he settled down to the tent roof and 
pushed his head against it, as though 
he were trying to swim through. 

I didn’t dare shift my weight quick- 
ly enough to look though one of 
the lower ports while he was still 
in that position, so I couldn’t tell 
whether his helmet stretched the fab- 
ric enough to let him see through 
— it was, after all, a lot smaller 
than my tank. I did let myself 
down very gingerly, so as not 
to move my container noticeably, 
but by the time my eyes had reached 
one of the lower ports he had risen 
again — at least, I could see nothing 
against the fabric except his shadow. 
He seemed to have started swimming 
away> and I took a chance and 
straightened up quickly. The shadow 
had told the truth. He was heading 
back in the direction from which he 
had come. 

T his time I was much more care- 
ful with the clock. He was 
back with another man in just under 
eight minutes. His companion was 
carrying either the cylinder that had 
been used in moving the wreck, or 
one just like it; the first man was 
also carrying something, but I 
couldn’t make out what it was right 
away. It looked like a rather untidy 
bundle of rope. 

When he stopped above the tank 
and shook it out, however, it turned 
out to be a cargo net, which he be- 
gan to work around the tank. Ap- 
parently he had decided on his first 
inspection that the natural irregulari- 



OCEAN ON TOP 



25 




ties of his find didn’t offer much 
hold to a lope. I oouLdn’t exactly 
blame ham for that oondixsion, but 
I very much wished he hadn’t reach- 
ed it. I wasn’t sure how strong the 
net might be, but unless it were 
grossly defective in manufacture it 
would hold my ballast slugs. If it 
were fastened around tank and slugs 
both, releasing the latter would be- 
come a pointless gesture. It was de- 
finitely time to go, and I reached 
for the master ballast release. 

Then I had another thought. 
Dropping the lead would presum- 
ably give my presence away, assum- 
ing they hadn’t already guessed 
there was someone inside. That cat 
was out of the bag, and nothing 
else I could do would tell them any 
more. I might as well, therefore, try 
somethinig else which might keep 
that net from enfolding me until I 
was over bare rock again and stood 
a chance of dropping the transpon- 
der effectively. There seemed noth- 
ing to lose by it, so I extended all 
the legs at once. 

Neither of the swimmers was 
actually hit, but they were very 
startled. The one with the net had 
been touching the tank at the time, 
and may have thought that some- 
thing he hod done was responsible 
for reicasing the springs. At any 
rate, neither of them seemed to feel 
that any more haste than before 
was ne^ed, os they should have 
done if they’d suspected a man was 
inside. They simply went about the 
job of attaching the lifting device 
as they had to the other wreck; 
there were plenty of things to fasten 
lines to now that the legs were out, 



and it would have been hard or im- 
possible (to get the net around the 
new configuration. That was all to 
the good. 

The technique was the same as 
before. I assumed the cylinder con- 
tained a chemical gas generator, 
considering the pressure the balloon 
was expanding against. That was 
jxist a fleeting thought, though. It 
was much more interesting to watch 
the two swimmers pushing me 
toward the edge of the roof even 
before my container had lifted en- 
tirely clear of the fabric. Things were 
certainly looking up; only two peo- 
ple, bare rock coming up — no, 
don’t be too hasty; maybe they’ll 
push you right to that entrance you 
want to find. Wait it out, boy. I 
pulled my fingers away from the 
panel, and locked them together for 
extra safety. 

J ust as bad been done with Pug- 
nose, the tank was moved away 
from the tent and then along parallel 
with its edge. The motion was slow 
— even with a weightless load there 
was plenty of water to push out of 
the way — and we were more than 
fifteen minutes on the trip. I kept 
watching for some sign of the en- 
trance, expecting a break of some 
sort in the fabric itself, but that 
wasn’t the arrangement I fLnaJly saw. 

After a quarter of an hour my 
porters aimed away from the lights 
again and headed up the slope which 
I assumed was still to our dght. 
About two hundred yards in this 
new direction brought us to the lip 
of another bowl or golly, apparently 
much like the one I had almost 

ib; 



26 




been trapped in a few hours before, 
but larger. The center of this de- 
pression was even more brightly 
lighted than the roof of the tent, 
and the entrance was in the very 
middle of the bri^t region. 

I didn’t take a very good look 
at it; I acted too fast. I glimpsed 
what seemed to be a smooth-walled 
pit about forty feet across with 
ladders going down at a couple of 
dozen points around its rim. Most 
of the light came from some point 
in the pit below my line of vision. 
Between me and the opening were 
a dozen or more swimming figures, 
and it was the sight of these that 
made me act. If I were to be sur- 
rounded by a whole school of swim- 
mers, my chances of dropping a 
transponder unnoticed would be neg- 
ligible; and without spending any 
more time in thought, I dropped the 
ballast and one of the sounders 
simultaneously. I instantly realized 
that might be a mistsjte, since 
each of the lead slabs was heavy 
enough even under water to smash 
the instrument, and as I felt the 
tank lurch upward I dropped an- 
other of the little machines. There 
was a good chance that my com- 
pany had been distracted by the 
ballast — a much better one than I 
realized, as I found later. 

I heard the lead hit the rock. So, 
evidently, did the swinuners around 
the hole. It took them a few seconds 
to spot the source of the racket. A 
man judges sound direction partly 
from the difference in arrival time 
of the wave at his two ears; and 
with the high speed of sound in 
water, the fact that the disturbance 



was also being carried by the rock, 
and the helmets lihcy were all wear- 
ing it was impossible for lihem to 
get more than a vague notion of 
where the sound had originated. 
When they did start coming my way 
it was in response to a flashlight 
which one of my carriers was shin- 
ing toward them. 

T he two original swimmers were 
hanging onto my legs — the 
tank’s, I should say. They couldn’t 
hold me down, of course. It takes 
more than a couple of almost-float- 
ing human bodies to replace several 
tons of lead. They were staying with 
me, though, and guiding the others. 

That didn’t worry me at first, 
since there weren’t enough people 
in sight to hold me down, and if 
there had been they couldn’t all 
have found room to get hold. The 
only real cause for anxiety was the 
possibility that there might be work 
subs with outside handling equip- 
ment somewhere around. Even from 
these, though. I’d be fairly safe if 
they’d just put off their appearance 
for a few more minutes. They’d 
have to hunt me with sonar once I 
was out of sight, and I was beginning 
to feel pretty certain that the last 
thing this bunch would do was send 
out sonar waves. The darned things 
travel too far and can be recog- 
nized too easily. I still didn’t know 
what these folks were up to, but 
there was enough obviously illegal 
about it to suggest that secrecy 
would be high on their policy list. 

The ones who were holding on 
to me would have to drop off soon. 
There isn’t an underwater breathing

didn’t care what gas mixture these 
characters were breathing; there are 
aws of physics and human bodies 
lave to obey them. 

The. more distant swimmers were 
aiming back as this thought crossed 
ny mind; 1 could see them against 
he fading background of the lighted 
pit. I could also see, poorly, the 
ight which one of my hitch-hikers 
jvas shining toward them. He seem- 
^ to have some hope still; maybe 
there was a sub in the neighborhood, 
and he was trying to stick with me 
long enough to guide it. Unless it 
showed up very soon, though, he 
was going to lose that gamble and 
kill himself in the bargain. 

I saw another swimmer, quite 
close, dwindling between me and 
the light; my second passenger must 
have dropped off. When would the 
first go? His light was still shining, 
but it could hardly do any good 
now. I could barely see the pit, and 
surely no one down there could see 
his little flash. Evidently he realized 
this, for after a few more seconds 
it went out. I expected to see him 
leave like his fellow, since he could 
do no more good by sticking, but 
he wasn’t thinking along those lines. 
He had very different ideas, and 
one of them from his viewpoint was 
a very good one. I didn’t like it so 
much. 

The dual-phase stuff they make 
pressure tanks out of isn’t a metal, 
and differs widely from any metal 
in its elastic properties; but like 



metals, if you hit it it makes a nose. 
1 didn’t know what my rider started 
hitting with, but it most certainly 
made a noise. I, from inside, can 
vouch for that. A nice, steady, once- 
a-second tapping resounded from 
the tank, hurting my ears and do- 
ing worse to my plans. He didn’t' 
need his light; any work sub could 
home in on that noise from miles 
away if it had even a decent mini- 
mum of instrumentation. 

And there was no way that I 
could i thinic of to stop him. 

V 

I could try the legs, of course. I 
did. It was so dark by now, with 
the light from entrance pit and tent 
roof alike faded to the barest glim- 
mer, that he may not even have 
known that I did anything. If he’d 
been holding on by a leg he may 
have been disconcerted when I pull- 
ed it in and maybe bruised when I 
popped it out again, but there was 
no evidence that anything of the 
sort happened. I ran the legs through 
their cycle several times without 
making the slightest change in the 
rhythm of that tajyping. 

I tried shifting my weight to 
make the tank roll over. It worked, 
but didn’t bother my passenger. Why 
should it? A swimmer doesn’t care 
whether he’s right side up or not, 
and a submarine hitch4iiker in total 
darkness should care even less. I 
was the only one who was bothered. 

But why was this character alive, 
conscious and active? We’d risen 
more than a thousand feet now, 
through a pressure difference that 



28 



IF 




should have popped his suit if it were 
really sealed as tightly as 1 had 
judged. If it weren’t, and if he were 
valving off gas to keep his lung 
volume down, he was going to be in 
trouble when he descended again; 
end in any case, volume or no 
volume troubles, whether he was 
breathing helium or anything else, 
he should by now be completely 
helpless with embolisms. 

The simple sad fact, independent 
of what should be, was that he was 
still going strong, and I had no way 
of getting rid of him. 

Nothing like this had been fore- 
seen by the Board geniuses who had 
worked out this mission. There was 
not the slightest doubt that some 
sort of sub was going to be along 
shortly to pick me up — no other 
notion was sane, in view of the fact 
that this fellow had been fit to stick 
with me. There were always insane 
notions to consider, of course; may- 
be he had decided to sacrifice his 
life to make sure I didn’t get back 
to the surface, but even that assumed 
the coming of something. Maybe a 
torpedo, but something. Personally I 
doubted the sacrifice idea. Lots of 
people will, for a cause they con- 
sider important enough, but I’ve 
never met a lawbreaker who acted 
that way. Especially I’ve never seen 
an energy waster who would; selfish- 
ness is the key word with those lads 
— keep the eye out for Number 
One. 

But never mind the psychology; 
what’s to be done? The guy may be 
a moving corpse, but he’s still there 
broadcasting. Why didn’t I come 
down in a work sub? Skip that ques- 



tion; it’s a waste of good thinking 
time. How can I make him get off, 
or at least stop making noise? 

Badly phrased question. I catft 
make him do anything. He’s outside, 
and I’m inside, and with this pressure 
difference never the twain shall meet. 
Then, how can I persuade him to 
leave or shut up? Until I start com- 
municating, I can’t persuade him 
either. Obvious. 

I put on my lights, both inside 
and out. That at least caught the 
fellow’s attention; the tapping 
stopped for a moment. Then it re- 
sumed, but less regularly, and I 
caught glimpses of him as he work- 
ed his way to a place which would 
let him see through one of the ports. 
I pulled my own face far enough 
back from it so that he could see me 
clearly, and for a few seconds we 
just looked at each other. The tap- 
ping stopped again. 

I t was the same man who had 
found the tank. I’m not a mind 
reader, but I felt pretty sure from 
his expression that he had only just 
realized there was anyone inside 
and that the discovery bothered as 
well as surprised him. He resumed 
his banging on the tank, in a much 
more irregular pattern. After a few 
seconds I realized that he must be 
sending some sort of code, though 
I couldn’t read it. 

I tried to explain by gestures that 
the radcet was hurting my ears, but 
all he did was shrug. If he cared 
at all about my comfort, it certainly 
wasn’t at the top of his priority list. 
He finished his code message at last 
and resumed the regular tapping. He

didn’t seem angry — didn’t scowl, 
or sihake a &t at me, or anyttihing 
of ithat sort, but be i^idn’t look as 
though be considered me a long- 
lost friend, editber. I could see his 
face dearly and without distortion 
througih the helmet, but I could 
see no sign of reial Interest in his 
expression. I sipent some time trying 
to get him to respond to my ges- 
tures, but he paid no attention. I 
thought of writing a note that he 
could read through the port, though 
I couldn’t guess what languages he 
might know, and I managed to find 
some scraps of paper in one of my 
pockets; but I could find nothing 
to write with, and that idea col- 
lapsed. I finally gave up and turned 
my lights off again. There was no 
use in helping him guide the sub to 
us. 

I couldn’t thinlc of any more prac- 
tical plans, and my mind wandered 
back to the question of how the 
fellow lived. We had risen several 
huadred more feet during the time 
the lights were on, and his suit hadn’t 
emitted a single bubble. I was begin- 
ning to wonder whether it really 
was an ambient-pressure unit. It was 
hard to see how anything so thin, 
and especially so flexible, oouild pos- 
sibly be pressure armor; on the 
other hand, the peculiarilties of the 
tent roof indicated that someone 
had 'been making progress in molec- 
ular architecture. I was in no posi- 
tion to say such armor was impos- 
sible, but I wished I could make at 
least a vague guess as to how it was 
done. 

I can feel a little silly about it 
now, of course. I’d had Ihe man in 

30 



full sight, well Ughited, only a few 
feet away from me for fully five 
minuties, and I missed the key fact 
— not in something I saw but in 
something I didn’t see. At least, I’m 
not alone in my folly. 

The tapping kept up. It wasn’t real- 
ly loud enough to be painful, but it 
was annoying, Chinese water torture 
style. It may have been equally so 
to the fellow outside who was doing 
it, and I got a little consolation out 
of the thought that at least he was 
having to work at it. I got a httie 
more out of the realization that as 
long as he did keep it up the help 
he was calling hadn’t arrived yet. 

Two thousand feet was less than 
balfwiay to the surface, though it 
was an unbelievable pressure change 
for my hitch-hiker. It wasn’t very 
much comfort to me to know that 
I’d put that much water under me; 
even twice as much wouldn’t be 
much help. It wasn’t os though 
there’d be a police squadron stand- 
Lag by to pick me op, or even a 
single boat. The tank had Qhly the 
normal automatic tran$i9pfil%ers for 
calling help, and they w^SIliil^t even 
stait to function until I re^lhed the 
surface — which I was unlikely to 
do. There probably was a Board 
vessel within a few miles, since the 
plan didn’t indude my niavi'gaitiing 
the opened halves of the tank to 
Easter Island when I got back to the 
surface, but that would do me no 
immediate good. The storm would 
probably still be going on, and they 
wouldn’t be able to see me at fifty 
yards. If they did, they probably 
couldn’t do anything about it unless 
there were more specialized salvage 

IF 




gear aboard than seemed likely. Even 
a minior ocean storm is quiite a dis- 
turbance, and one doesn’t pick a 
ipressiure tank bobbing around on its 
waves casually out of tihe water. 

T here was an encouraging side to 
that thought, though. If I did 
get to the surface, it would also be 
hard for any sub to get hold of 
the tank. My broadcaster would 
then be working, and maybe — just 
maybe — if it even brought a Board 
ship into the general neighborhood 
the pursuers would keep out of sight. 
On the other hand, it was at least 
equally likely that they would con- 
sider it worth every effort to get 
hold of me, witnesses or no wit- 
nesses, in view of what I had ob- 
viously seen down below. But the 
other hope was worth holding onto 
for its comfort value. Since I’m a 
civilized human ibedng, I never 
thought until later of the possibility 
that if they couldn’t capture me 
they miight just punch a hole in the 
tank and let me sink. 

Maybe I’d make it. The minutes 
were passing. It was taking each one 
a year to do it, but they were pass- 
ing. Each brought me nearly two 
hundred feet closer to those storm 
waves, if they were still there. I 
hadn’t bother^ to check the fore- 
cast beyond the time I was scheduled 
to submerge, and I’d been down 
quite a few hours. I’m not immune 
to sea-sickness by any means, but 
I rather hoped there would still be 
enough v/ave action to give me a 
good dose of it this time. Maybe 
it would even make my friend just 
outside lose his grip on whatever 



he was holding onto. That was some- 
thing else to hope for. 

But first I’d have to get up to 
those waves, and there was still half 
a mile to go. The tapping went on. 
If I’d been an5rwhere else on Earth 
I might have preferred the Chinese 
water drops by then, but 'this was no 
place to be asking for water drops. 
I tried to shut out the sound and 
keep my attention on other things, 
like the pressure gauge — was there 
a little wiggle in its needle which 
might be due to wave action far 
above? — or the question of food. 
If the waves were there, maybe I’d 
better put off eating. 

I kept moving £rom one port to 
another in a hectic but raither use- 
less effort to spot the sub which 
must be approaching; ibut it was my 
passenger who saw it first. 

VI 

I knew what had happened when 
the regular tapping suddenly 
changed once more to the complex 
code, but it took me another half 
minute to spot the approaching light. 

I didn’t have a very wide angle of 
view from any one of the jx>iits. 

All I could see at first was the 
light, a solitary spark on a space- 
dark background, but there could 
be no doubt what it was. It v[as 
just a little below us, well to one 
side. Its bearing changed as it grew 
brighter. Apparently it was approach- 
ing on a spiral course, holding the 
sound of the tapping at a constant 
angle off its bow to let the pikt keep 
a constant idea of his distance from 
the source.

Even when it was close I had 
trouble making it out, for its main 
spotlight was turned straight on the 
tank and there was too little ddfifused 
radiance to show anything dose to 
it. This apparently bothered my pas- 
senger, too, for there was another 
burst of code tapping as the sub 
halted thirty yards away, and the 
light went out. In its place a dozen 
smaller beams illuminated the whole 
area, none of them shining directly 
our way; so I could see the new- 
comer fairly well. 

It was not exactly like any sub 
I’d seen before, but was similar 
enough to some of them to give my 
eyes a handle. It was small, either 
one or two men, not built for speed, 
and well equipped with manipula- 
tion gear on the outside — regular 
arm and hand extensions, grapples, 
bits, probes and what looked like 
a water-jet digger. One of my hopes 
died quickly; there had been a 
chance that a small sub would not 
have enough negative buoyancy to 
drag the tank back down, but this 
fellow had big, fat lift chambers and 
must have ballast to match. It was 
evidently a tug, among other things. 
If it could get hold of me, it could 
puM me down, all right; and it was 
hard to see how it could be kept 
from getting that hold. All I had to 
fend it off were the legs. 

I wasn’t sure how effective these 
could be, but I kept my fingers at 
the panel resolved not to miss any- 
thing that looked like a good chance. 
At least, now that some sort of ac- 
tion was in the offing, I wasn’t dith- 
ering as I had been during the min- 
utes before the sub came in sight. 



The pilot’s first method was to 
drift above me and settle down. He 
must have had a strong streak of 
showoff in him, since it was hard to 
imagine a less efficient means of 
sinking a round object. I thought 
he’d have his troubles, but my pas- 
senger didn’t seem upset, and I 
have to admit the oh^oter knew 
his boat handling. The swimmer 
waved him into position, putting me 
under the sub’s center of buoyancy, 
and he made contact. My pressure 
gauge promptly showed that the up- 
ward motion had been reversed. 

I waited a few seconds in the 
hope that my hitch--hiker would go 
inside the sub, but he made no mo- 
tion to, and I finally had to let 
him see my technique. This was 
simple enough — simpler than idl- 
ing along the sea bottom, since the 
surface above me was much smooth- 
er. Also, I didn’t have to go so far 
to accomplish something; a very 
small shift away from his center of 
gravity gave niy tank’s lift a torque 
that was too much either for his re- 
action time or his control jets. Since 
he had enough weight in his tanks 
to overcome my own lift, he flipped 
over, and I was on my way up 
again. 

Unfortunately, as I promptly 
learned, Lester the Limpet was still 
with me. His tapping started up 
within seconds of the time I got out 
from under. His friend evidently 
took a while to get his machine back 
into trim — I could understand 
that; tumbling, with a couple of tons 
of surplus negative buoyancy thrown 
in, is a problem for any sub — 
but he was back all too soon. He

IF 




was no longer in a mood to sihow 
off; he bored straight in, with a 
grapple extended. 

I turned on my outside lights, part- 
ly to make things harder for him 
and partly so that I could see better 
myself. This was going to be tricky 
for both of us; he had to find some- 
thing the mechanical hand could 
grip, and I had to shift my own 
body weight so as to turn the tank 
enough to bring a leg into line for 
what I had in mind. It was just as 
well I’d gotten my recent practice 
on the bottom. At least I knew to a 
hair where each leg went out, rela- 
tive to the positions of the ports. 

I took him by surprise the first 
time. He hadn’t considered all the 
possibilities of those legs — maybe 
be didn’t even know how many I 
could use, though they were visible 
enough from the outside. He match- 
ed my upward drift very nicely, 
though I was able to hamper him a 
little bit by shifting my weight and 
changing the frontal presentation of 
the slightly irregular tank. With re- 
lative vertical motion practically 
zero, he came in slowly with the 
mechanical hand reaching for some 
projection or other — I couldn’t 
teU what he had in mind. I rolled 
just a little to get a leg in line with 
the grapple, and when the latter was 
about two feet fiom contact I 
snapped the leg out. 

The ^ring was strong. Remember, 
it was built to prop the tank in 
position on a slope even when the 
ballast was still attached. The en- 
gineers who built it could tell you 
bow many pounds of shove it gave. I 



can’t, but I could feel it. The sub 
and tank were pushed neaidy away 
from each other. The line of thrust 
was not exactly -through the ceater 
of my shell, and I got quite a bit 
of spin out of it. The sub didn’t. 
Either the push was better centered 
on him or he was quicker this time 
with his control jets. 

He was a stubborn character. He 
came back and tried the same thing 
again, after my spin had stopped. 
I was able to repeat, with about the 
same results. Konrad the Ohitom was 
still with me, though, and he had my 
technique figured out by this time. 
He moved a little away from me to 
free his hands for signalling, waved 
them for about ten seconds in a 
complicated pattern that meant noth- 
ing to me, and then came back and 
took hold of the tank once more. 

The sub made another approach, 
similar to preceding -two, and I 
tried to line up for another kick. My 
friend, however, had different ideas. 
He was much farther from the cen- 
ter than I was, and could exert much 
more torque. He could also see 
where the legs were, and when I 
shifted my weight to line up the 
proper one with the approaching 
grapple he interfered. He was too 
smart to fiight me direotly, though 
he probably could have managed it; 
instead, he let me get moving and 
then supplied an extra shove with 
me or to one side so that I either 
overshot or missed the right position. 
I made three attempts to lineup as 
the hand was coming in and finally 
gave the kick a little out of line 
when -the sub was about to make 
contact. The leg grazed the side of

the handler and put la iliifttle spin on 
the tank, but didn’t hit anything soiliid 
CDough to push os apart. Woise, it 
gave the sub operator a dhanoe to 
grab the leg itself. This he seemed 
to feel was a better 'hold what- 
ever he had planned on; he clamped 
on tilghtly and began to cut buoyancy 
once more. 

T his proved to be a mistake, 
though it didn’t help me as 
much as it might have. The leg 
wasn’t strong enough to hold the 
tank down. It parted, and once more 
the sub disappeared below me. I cut 
my lights promptly, hoping that my 
passenger had lost his hold with the 
jeai. Maybe he did, but if so he 
wasn’t far enough away to lose track 
of me. In a few seconds the tapping 
resumed, and in a few more the 
lights of the sub were close enough 
to make my blackout an idle ges- 
ture. I turned mine back on again 
so that I could see to resume the 
sparring match. 

Now he got the idea of making 
his approach toward the spot where 
the leg had been lost, so that I’d 
have to turn further to bring an- 
other into line. My swimming 
friend was cooperating nobly, and 
for a little while I was afraid they 
had me. The sub operator was too 
smart to try for a leg again, but 
he managed to keep out of the way 
of several kicks I gave out. He got 
in, made what should have been a 
succesful grab at something on my 
outer surface, but was hurried and 
missed. He had to back up for an- 
other try . and I had time to get 
another idea into operation. 



I knew where the swimmer was. 
1 could see oiotigh of him to tell 
not only that but to guess which 
way he’d be pushing next time. I be- 
gan to put a spin on the tank with 
him at one pole so that he wouldn’t 
notice it quite so quickly. This work- 
ed, though I didn’t get a really rapid 
rotation — I couldn’t, of course, with 
such poor torque; but with the tank’s 
weight I had enough for what I 
wanted. One of my strong points in 
basic physics, ages ago in school, 
was mechanics. I couldn’t handle the 
present problem quantitaitively be- 
cause I didn’t know either my angu- 
lar speed or the tank’s moment of 
inertia, but I hit the qualitative 
answer on the button. As the grapple 
approached again I shifted my 
weight to start the tank processing. 
Billy Barnacle tried his usual stunt 
of pushing me sideways and seat 
the leg right through the point I 
wanted. Either he’d forgotten what 
they’d taught him aibout gyroscopes 
or he was gettmg tired. I hit the 
grapple dead center with my kick, 
and we were apart again. If I’d been 
driving that sub, I’d have been get- 
ting tired of the whole business by 
now. 

Apparently he was more patient 
than I. He was back again all too 
soon. 

I had gained maybe three or four 
hundred feet with each pass of our 
duel. I had an uneasy feeling that I 
was going to run out of tricks be- 
fore those increments added up to 
the total distance to the sui^ce. Cer- 
tainly if he had the patfeboe to 
keep repeating the same technique, 
he’d soon run me dry. 



34 



IF 




He didn’t, though. He seemed to 
have decided that the graipple 
wasn’t quite the right tool after all. 
When he came back next time He 
did his usual speed-matching some 
distance above me, instead of level. 
A small light flickered, apparently 
in code, and my pressure^roof 
friend let go of the tank and swam 
up to the sub. He was back in a 
moment, trailing a line behind him. 

Apparently it had been decided 
that human hands were more versa- 
tile than mechanical ones. 

A t first I wasn’t worried. There 
was nothing on the outside of 
the tank except the legs which would 
really lend itself to the attachment 
of a rope, and it had already been 
demonstrated that the legs weren’t 
strong enough. Hours before, on the 
bottom — no, come to think of it, it 
was much less than one hour — my 
pal had felt the need of a cargo 
net to wrap around the sphere. If 
he didn’t have such a net here, all 
should be well. 

He did, unfortunately. It was big- 
ger and heavier than the one they 
had had on the bottom, which was 
probably why he wasn’t swimming 
with it. When he got back just above 
the tank he began hauling on his 
line, and the net emerged from one 
of the sub’s service ports. He pulled 
it to him and began to spread it 
out so that my tank would float up 
into it. 

He failed the first time through 
no doing of mine; he simply didn’t 
get his net deployed in time. I ran 
into it while it was still only partly 



open. It had more of its weight on 
one side of me than on the other, so 
I automatically rolled out from un- 
der it and kept on rising. I didn’t 
have to move a finger. The sub was 
also rising, of course, so the net 
trailed downward to the end of its 
line and folded itself together. The 
boy in the sub had to reel in me- 
chanically while the swimmer held 
on to me, before they could go 
through it all again. 

That was another few hundred feet 
gained. 

The next time they spread the 
net much farther above me. Once 
open it was even less maneuverable 
than the tank, and by a little judici- 
ous rolling to make the outer ir- 
regularities affect my direction of as- 
cent I managed to get far enough 
flom its center to roll out the same 
way as before. What that team need- 
ed was two more swimmers, I de- 
cided. 

It turned out that One more was 
enough. They reeled in the net again, 
lifted the sub a distance, adjusted 
its buoyancy so that it rose a little 
more slowly than I did, and then 
the operator came out to join the 
swimmer. Each took a corner of the 
net and with the boat for the third 
comer formed a wide triangle which 
they were able to keep centered 
over me. I tried to work toward the 
sub, which seemed to be unoccupied 
and wouldn’t . back up to keep the 
net spread. It didn’t work. The men 
moved just a little in the same di- 
rection, letting the net sag toward 
me. 

The next thing I knew it was 
draped around me, and I couldn’t 



OCEAN ON TOP 



35 




lell which way to roll even if I had 
been able to start iroilliiig. The swim- 
mers came in from their corners and 
began tying it together at the bot- 
tom. 

If they finished, I was done. I 
watched them as well as 1 could, 
trying to spot where there was an 
edge — anything to tell me that 
there was more weight of net on one 
side of me than the other. I spotted 
what I thought was a chance to in- 
terrupt the work while I got a better 
look, and I’m afraid I took it. 

One of the men was next to the 
tank and a little below it, pulling 
a section of net closer. Maybe it 
was the sub operator — the light 
was good, but I didn’t take time to 
check — and he wasn’t as familiar 
with the leg arrangement as his 
companion. Anyway, he was in the 
way of one of them, and I let him 
have it. 

M y intention, if I had one — I 
really didn’t take time to thiTik 
— was to knock him out of the way 
so I’d have a Chance to roll out of 
the net. I certainly didn’t mean to 
do him serious or permanent dam- 
age. The disk at the end of the leg, 
though, caught him on the right side 
and could hardly have helped break- 
ing some ribs. It kicked him away 
like a shark butted by a dolphin. 
The iine he was holding practically 
flew out of his right ha^, and a 
tool whose nature I couldn’t make 
out fell from his left. He began to 
sank out of sight. 

The other swimmer was onto him 
before he’d left the reach of the 
U^ts. He was evidently out cold; 



his body was completely limp as his 
friend towed him up tow^d the 
sub. I didn’t watch too closely, partly 
because I was tryonig to roll myself 
out of the net and partly because I 
regretted what I’d done. 

I made little progress with the 
rolling. They’d gotten some knots in- 
to the system already, and it looked 
as though I were ^ere to stay. I 
managed to make a half turn, getting 
what had been the tank’s bottom 
when I was caught swung up to the 
top, but it didn’t do me a bit of 
good. The meshes wound around the 
tank even more tightly during the 
turn. 

I was a little above the sub by 
that time — as I said, they’d 
ta'immed it to rise a little more 
slowly than the tank — and the ten- 
sion on the line connecting the net 
with the boat was swinging me di- 
rectly over the latter. It was also 
tipping the sub, I noticed, since the 
line wasn’t attached anywhere near 
the latter’s center of gravity. I 
watched, helpless but hopeful, to 
see whether the single rope was 
strong enough to drag me down when 
they really put weight on the boat. 

I didn’t find out. The uninjured 
man towed his companiion to the 
little vessel, opened its main hatch, 
and after some trouble got him in- 
side. Up to that point we’d still been 
rising. Now it appeared that the sub 
was putting on more weight, for the 
line tightened and my pressure gauge 
reversed its direction once more. 
However, the sub, which had leveled 
off after the men got on board, now 
went down badly by the stem. 
Evidently the off-center lift through 



36 



IF 




the net line was more than could be 
countered by shunting ballast, at 
least if enough total weight was in 
the tanks to maintain a descent Ap- 
parently there was a higher pri- 
ority attached to bringing me back 
than to keeping the boat level. I 
watched, with my fingers crossed, 
hoping the line would give. 

It didn’t, but someone’s patience 
did. Maybe the swimmer I had hit 
was seriously injured, though I 
hoped not; but w'hatever the cause, 
whoever was now running the sub 
decided that speed was of prime im- 
portance. 

He suddenly cast off rope, net, and 
all, and disappeared in a few sec- 
onds. I was alone at last, bound 
once more for the surface. It was 
almost an anticlimax. 

It was also quite a letdown. The 
dogfight, if you could call it that, 
had lasted only ten or fifteen min- 
utes in all and certainly hadn’t in- 
volved me in much physical labor, 
but I felt as though I’d just done 
ten rounds with someone a couple 
of classes above my weight. 

Now I was safe. There wasn’t a 
prayer of their finding me again 
without sonar, with no one hanging 
outside to broadcast sound waves 
from my own hull, and with my 
lights out — I hastily turned them 
out as that thought crossed my mind, 
I had less than two thousand feet to 
go — not much over ten minutes, 
unless the drag of the net and line 
made too much difference. I 
watched the gauges for a while and 
decided that they didn’t, and for the 
first time since I’d left the surface I 
feU asleep. 



VU 

I was awakened by bekng tossed 
around; the stoiim was still on. 
More specifically, 1 was awakened 
by being cracked on the head by a 
corner of the control panel. 

It wasn’t hard enough to damage 
either the panel or my skull, but it 
was uncomfortable. So was the 
whole situation. Riding up and down 
on fifteen-foot waves is bad enough 
in a stable boat, but in a nearly 
spherical container which has prac- 
tically no preference for a definite 
up and down it is infiniiteLy worse. 
I”ve been in free fail in space, which 
is no joke, but I’ll take it again any 
time ^fore being a human volley- 
ball in the middle of even a modest- 
sized Pacific storm. That was one 
thing they hadn’t bothered too much 
about when they designed the sub- 
marine escape shells. The idea was to 
get to the surface rather than to be 
comfortable afterward. All I could 
do was turn on the rescue broad- 
caster and try to keep my stomach 
in place. 

I couldn’t even be sure anyone 
was receiving it — the broadcast, I 
mean. It was a good bet that they 
were, since my return was certainly 
expected. But several good bets had 
failed to pay off already. 

I couldn’t even sleep. Fortunately 
I’d had enough sense not to eat 
when the idea had occurred a while 
back, so I couldn’t do what my 
stomach wanted most to do just 
then. I couldn’t do anything. The 
whole situation was as bad physically 
as the original descent had been 
mentally. 



OCEAN ON TOP 



37 




But there’s no point trying to 
make it any clearer; I might succeed. 

I did wish I’d taken the trouble 
to find out how long the storm was 
due to last. Then I might have got- 
ten some comfort from an occasion- 
al glance at the clock. As things 
were, I quickly found that it was 
better not to look at it; the time 
since the last look was always so 
much less than I’d guessed. As it 
turned out, I should have watched 
some of the other instruments, 
though their reading would have 
been no comfort either — and there 
would have been nothing to do about 
them. 

I would never have believed that 
the end of that motion could have 
been anything but a relief. If any- 
one had told me that it would make 
me feel worse, I’d have used violence 
on him for fear he might convince 
me. Unfortunately, he’d have been 
perfectly right. The end came much 
too suddenly. 

The first motion to stop was the 
roMing. The tank stUl bobbed up and 
down, but seemed to have acquired 
a definite top and bottom. Then the 
vertical oscillation also decreased, 
and finally stopped. By that time 
there was nothing more the pressure 
gauge could tell me, but I looked 
at it anyway. 

I was right. The tank was going 
down again. 

T here was one thing I didn’t have 
to worry about; it wasn’t a 
case of ordinary sinking. The only 
hollow space which gave the tank 
its buoyancy was the one I was in, 
and if that had been leaking I’d 



have known it already. No, I was 
being pulled down; and granting 
that there are such things as giant 
squids, I didn’t for an instant think 
that one of them was responsible. 
The sonar monitor was dark now, 
but maybe it hadn’t been for the 
last hour or so — I wouldn’t have 
known. 

There was only one reasonable ex- 
planation. I looked down, not know- 
ing what I really hoped to see and 
didn’t see very much; the sub wasn’t 
bothering witib lights. I turned dn 
my own, but could see only the single 
line, taut now, leading from the 
net which was now thoroughly 
tangled around me to a vague bulk 
just on the edge of visibility. 

The Hne, it may be remarked, 
was quite strong enough for what 
it had to do; we were descending 
much faster than my original ballast 
had carried me down. If the own- 
ers of that rope were prepared to 
trust it under such stress, I saw no 
point in doubting their judgment. I 
didn’t even bother to hope it would 
break. I calculated that I’d be on 
the bottom in twenty minutes or so, 
and let it go at that. 

At least, I could eat now. I began 
to absorb a dextrose pill with such 
calmness as I could collect. There 
was nothing else to do; they had 
me. 

We were still several hundred feet 
from the bottom when company 
showed up. Two more subs, brightly 
lighted, hove into view. They were 
work machines similar to the one 
I’d had trouble with a few hours be- 
fore. If they were in communica- 
tion with the one which had me in 





nrEAN ON TOP 



tow, it was by means of something 
none of my instruments could pick 
up. They probably were, sinoe their 
maneuvers were perfectly co- 
ordinated. First one and then the 
other newcomer swung close beside 
me, and each used its “hands” to 
hang several hooked slugs of metal 
into my net. These weights took 
nearly all the stress off the tow 
rope and removed any hope there 
might have been of its breaking at the 
last moment. 

Then a swimmer slipped out of 
each boat and took station beside 
me, saving themselves work by hold- 
ing onto the net too. I flicked my 
lights on for a moment, but couldn’t 
recognize either face. I began to 
wonder about the fellow I’d hit and 
what his friends might think about 
it if I’d hurt him really seriously. 
The human mind sometimes goes 
off on funny side tracks; I never 
once, while I was being towed, 
thought about their reaction to my 
having discovered their obviously 
secret installation. If I had, I’d prob- 
ably have told myself that if they 
really wanted to do anything final 
any of their subs could have crack- 
ed the tank with no trouble at all. 

Eventually the bottom came into 
view in the range of my own lights. 

It wasn’t luminous this time. I 
thought at first that they must have 
turned their lights off; then I re- 
alized that the storm must have car- 
ried me some distance, and there 
was no reason to expect to be very 
near the tent. This was ordinary 
sea bottom complete with crab bur- 
rows; I could tell, because after 
reaching it the sub reeled in most 



of the tow line and left me only 
about twenty feet up. This gave me 
a good look at the boat itself, too, 
and I could see that it wasn’t my 
former antagonist. For one thing, it 
was about twice as big. 

It wasn’t very different in general 
design, though. There was still plen- 
ty of equipment on the outside — 
more, if anything. It was meant for 
work, not travel. Even without the 
drag of my tank it wouldn’t have 
made very good speed over the bot- 
tom, but I could see that we were 
moving. I had no doubt we were 
heading either for the entrance I’d 
seen earlier or for some other one 
and kept looking ahead for its lights. 

A s it turned out, we reached a 
different one. We were a cou- 
ple of hours getting there, though 
that’s an academic point since I 
didn’t know where we’d started from 
anyway. This pit was smaller than 
the other, and the lighted tent roof 
was nowhere in sight when we reach- 
ed it. 

This entrance was only about 
twenty-five feet across, much too 
small for the sub that was towing 
me and borderline for the other two. 
It was perfectly cylindrical, with 
vertical sides, and opened from the 
bottom of a shallow bowl just as the 
other had. It was very well lighted, 
so I had no trouble making out de- 
tails. 

There were many ladders around 
the rim. At first they led down out 
of sight, but as I came closer I 
found I could see the bottom ends 
of those on the farther side of the 
opening. The pit was apparently a 



40 



IF 




hole in the roof of a chamber some- 
thing like forty feet deep. 

There were several more swim- 
mers in and above the hole who 
seemed to be waiting for us. As we 
approached, they paddled out rather 
casually and gathered around the 
tank as the sub that was towing me 
settled to the bottom just beside the 
entrance. 

My tank drifted upward and 
slightly forward until the tow rope 
was vertical. One of the swimmers 
waved a signal, and an escort sub 
swung back in and hung another 
slug of ballast onto my net. That 
took the rest of the tension off the 
rope, and I began ito sink. 

The swimmer signaled again, and 
the tow line came free of the big 
sub. Several men grabbed it; the 
rest took hold of the net, and they 
all began to work me toward the pit 
as I settled. This seemed to be the 
last lap. Unless they had the stupidi- 
ty to leave me right under their 
hole in the roof, which would be 
too much to expect even in twentieth- 
century realistic literature, the most 
remote chance of my getting back 
without their consent and assistance 
would vanish once I was inside that 
entryway. 

I was nearly frantic. Don’t ask me 
why I fdt so scared at one time and 
so calm and steady at another; I 
can’t tell you. It’s just the way I 
am, and if you don’t ilike it you don’t 
have to live with it, at least. 

I don’t know what I did or thought 
in those few minutes, and I’d prob- 
ably not want to tell anyone if I did 
remember. The fact was that there 
was nothing whatever I could do. I 



had all the power of a goldfish in' 
his bowl, and" that sometimes upsets 
a man — iwho, after all, is used to 
saving at least a little control over 
his environment. 

I was a little more calm as I reach- 
ed the edge of the pit; I don’t 
know the reason for that, either, 
but at least I can report the inci- 
dent. There was a pause as we 
reached the tops of the ladders, and 
the subs and swimmers 'both clus- 
tered around and began hanging 
more ballast onto my net, adding 
insult to injury. The swimmers also 
picked up what looked liked tool 
belts from hooks near the ladder 
tops and buckled them around their 
waists, though I couldn’t see why 
they should have more need of these 
inside than out. At least, I couldn’t 
see any reason at first; then it oc- 
curred to me that tools might 'be use- 
ful in opening up my tank. I de- 
cided not to think of that just yet. 

From inside, the pit looked even 
more like a hole in a ceiling. The 
chamber below was much larger 
than I had realized, fully a hundred 
feet on each side. The entrance was 
simply a black circle above me, and 
as I watched it ceased to 'be above 
me. The swimmers were pushing me 
toward one of the wal'ls. 

I ithought for a moment that roll- 
ing across the ceiling would at least 
be easier than the same action on the 
sea bottom, but dismissed the point 
as irrelevant and academic. My 
morale was rising, but was still pretty 
low. 

At least, I was still alive, and in a 
way I’d done some of my job. I’d

dropped the transponder near one 
entrance, and there seemed a decent 
chance that it hadn’t been found. 
My pick-me-up broadcast had been 
going for several hours at the sur- 
face, and the chance that it had been 
received was excellent. The Board 
would know I’d done something, and 
would certainly be moved to check 
up on what had become of me. If 
they swept the bottom with high- 
resolution sonar they could hardly 
miss the smooth surface of the tent, 
even if the transponders didn’t 
work. In fact, considering how big 
the tent seemed to be, it was rather 
surprising that ordinary depth-meter 
records hadn’t picked it up some 
tirne or other. 

I should have given more thought 
to that point, though it would have 
sent my morale downhill again. As 
it was, I could believe that this in- 
stallation would be found fairly soon, 
even if I myself wasn’t. 

The big room had little detail 
to mention. I assumed at first that 
it would turn out to be a pressure 
lock or the vestibule to one, but 
the big tunnel opening from it had 
no door. There were smaller panels 
on the walls which might have been 
locks — some of them were big 
enough to admit a human figure. 

The swimmers towed me toward 
the tunnel mouth and into it. It was 
fully twenty feet in diameter, much 
more than large enough for the tank, 
and was Mghted almost as well as 
the chamber we had just left. I found 
myself getting angry again at this 
bunch who were being so free with 
their energy. I was also beginning 



to wonder where they got so much 
of it. I’d run into power4)0€>tleggers 
before in the course of business, 
naturally, but never an outfit with 
so much of it to throw around. 

We went only a few yards — 
twenty or so — down the tunnel be- 
fore coming to another large room 
which opened from it. They towed 
me into this. It had several much 
smaller tunnels — maybe I should 
say shafts — opening from its floor; 
I counted eight in my first glance. 
None of these openings had lids or 
doors either. Apparently a large part 
of the installation was flooded and 
under outside pressure. Maybe it 
was a mine; that would account for 
the energy, if the product were 
uranium or thorium, and it would 
not be practical to try to keep all the 
windings and tunnels of a submarine 
mine free of water. 

I had just about time to run that 
thought through my mind while 
the swimmers were putting me and 
my tank down on the floor. It start- 
ed to roll a little, and I put out three 
legs to prop it. Luckily all three got 
through the meshes of the net which 
was still around me without being 
jammed. With that settled, I looked 
at the bunch of people around me to 
see what they’d do next. It was clear- 
ly up to them. 

I’m used to it now, but I still don’t 
like the memory of what they did 
and what it did to me. 

They took off their helmets. A 
mile under the sea, in pressure that 
would crush sponges metal into foil, 
they took off their helmets.

CONQUEROR 

by LARRY EISENBERG 



She seemed very like a woman 
— but there was something 
inhuman about her os well! 



J oe found much of the Sentient 
city quaint, even charming, but 
it was not like home. It was an anci- 
ent, sophisticated city on an anci- 
ent planet, and yet it did not dis- 
play the material comforts that Terra 
had attained after a meager fifty 
thousand years out of the Stone Age. 

He walked through the shattered 
fobbled streets in full gear, outfitted 
in the smart dark dress blues of the 
invading forces, looking for women 
and entertainment. It was not easy 
to find. Determined to make this a 
modd Occupation, the commanding 
geneaial had worked out a limited 
schedule of available services and 
had set up severe rationing standards. 
Only three drinks of the potent 



ragacsi were permitted daily. And 
at most one woman a day. Meals 
and food packages were also strictly 
regulated by item and quantity. 

Rationing control was handled by 
the Central Terran Computer. Pay- 
ment had to be in advance. Small 
input scan devices were, located all 
over the city which only accepted 
dogtags and recorded serial numbers 
plus the nature of the transaction. 
Joe sighed. He had been scouring 
the shops for souvenirs to send home 
and he *had already used up his quota 
of driiaks for the day. But he still 
had a woman coming. 

The Sentients were behaving with 
scrupulous propriety. They had been 
badly beaten, but they hadn’t relin- 



43 




quisihed their basic dignity. As repa- 
rations for their prolonged and cost- 
ly resistance, they had been forced 
to give up tremendous quantities of 
treasure and goods. Hence everyone 
was living on a substandard basis. 
But there was almost no black 
marketeering. 

There was very little prostitution, 
too. Traditionally the Sentients used 
android women for this purpose, 
amazingly lifelike figures designed 
for erotic pleasures, good enough to 
pass muster with the most exacting 
of men. But most of the Terran 
soldiers, like Joe, considered this 
practice emasculating, a sign of the 
degeneraition of the Sentient cul- 
ture, and avoided the android women 
like the plague. Only a handful of 
the men, weak in moral fiber and 
controls, joking to cover their inn^ 
shame, had defiled themselves in 
this way. 

Fortunately there were a few real 
women around, whose circumstances 
were so straitened that they had 
gone to the streets to earn Terran 
credits. But only a few. Joe had wait- 
ed now for fifty-three days. And the 
torment was growing stronger with 
each day. 

H e stepped into one of the very 
neat candy-pink social clubs 
maintained by the Sentients for the 
Terran soldiers. There were four 
women seated quietly about the 
room — all of them android, he was 
certain. They were uncannily like 
the Sentient women in appearance. 
None were pretty by Terran stan- 
dards. Their noses were too broad, 
their eyes set very wide apart, the 



skin an almost alabaster white. But 
they were extraordinarily sensuous 
creatures. He stared at each one in 
turn, tempted but not quite enough. 
He took great pride in maintaining 
his own self-respect, in holding on 
to his masculinity. 

He advanced to the bar and asked 
the Sentient bartender for a ragacsL 
“Your dogtag, please,” said the 
bartender. 

Joe slipped the metal disk into 
the scanner and waited stoically for 
the intermittent red flash to appear. 
It did and the bartender sig|h^> 
“I’m sorry, sir. You’ve reach your 
quota for the day. But TU be happy 
to serve you tomorrow.” 

“The hell with it,” snapped Joe. 
“I didn’t want the goddam drink 
anyway.” 

He stepped angrily into the street 
and looked along the narrow lane. 
There was no one in view. High 
above, two young Sentient women 
had been leaning out of an oval 
picture window but when they 
caught his glance they both withdrew 
and closed the outer blinds. He was 
terribly depressed. 

“I’m hungry,” he thought, “but 
it isn’t sex done. I want intimate 
contact with another human being.” 
He stopped off at a curio shop 
and chatted politely with the pro- 
prietor. He even priced several ex- 
pensive items although he knew he 
didn’t have sufficient credits left to 
pay for them. The Sentient dealer 
was courteous, but no more. Joe 
tried to hint obliquely at how lonely 
he was, but the Sentient didn’t seem 
to grasp his meaning. They parted 
on correct but distant terms.

IF 




And then he saw her. She wasn’t 
even as pretty as the -android women 
he had seen, but she was alive. He 
was certain of that. She had her 
head averted and was looking wist- 
fully into a shop window. He came 
up just behind her and looked over 
her shoulder. She was eyeing a lavish- 
ly packaged food assortment. 

“It looks mighty tempting, doesn’t 
it?” he said softly. 

She turned to look at him, but said 
nothing. 

On sudden impulse, he went into 
the store and used up his food al- 
lowance on the package. When he 
came out into the street he handed 
it to the Sentient woman. 

“I cannot take this from you,” 
she said. 

“No strings,” said Joe and when 
he saw the look of puzzlement on 
her face, he rephrased his words. “I 
want nothing in return,” he said. 

She looked at him warily for a 
moment and then reached out for 
the package. He was elated because 
she had accepted it. 

“Where do you live?” he said. 

“You wish to come home with 
me?” 

“Only to talk. Nothing more.” 

She shrugged and took his hand 
in hers, the warmth of her fingers 
coming almost as a shock to him. 
Together they wove through the 
maze of darkening streets, dimly lit 
by the orange glow of the setting 
Star above. There were tangles of 
debris everywhere since much of 
the destruction had not yet been 
cleared away by the Sentient popu- 
lation. He pretended not to see it. 

When they arrived outside her 



home, she asked him to wait while 
she went within. She returned in a 
few moments. 

“I can’t ask you in,” she said 
quietly. “My parents will not per- 
mit it. But since I have accepted 
your gift, I feel I owe you some- 
thing.” 

“You don’t owe me a thing,” he 
said vigorously. 

“No, no,” she insisted. “I will go 
to your home with you, now.” 

His home? He had no home on 
this planet. He was quartered with 
an elderly Sentient couple in a small 
bedroom with a private side en- 
trance. He told her this, and she 
shrugged her indifference. But he 
wanted more than gratitude. 

T hey walked to one of the few 
parks that had not been shatter- 
ed by the invasion. It was on a hill 
of several hundred feet that over- 
looked a river winding below like 
a metallic ribbon. He talked hesi- 
tantly about his parents, and when 
she looked at him sympathetically, 
he fished a frayed picture out of his 
wallet to show to her. She smiled 
and remarked about the resemblance. 

He asked her about herself, her 
family, but she wouldn’t answer. 

“I see only destruction about m«,” 
she said, and she pointed a slender 
finger toward the heaps of rubble 
that lay at the foot of the hill. Then 
she leaned toward him, and for the 
first time that evening, she ran her 
fingers gently over his cheek. His 
blood began to race at the implica- 
tions of her caress. 

“Do you like me?” he said earn- 
estly. ^'Really like me?” 



CONQUEROR

“I do,” she said seemingly in eam- 
nest. 

Although it wias terribly expen- 
sive, he hailed one of the few heli- 
buses thiait hovered over the raviagjed 
city. He had the pilot place them 
down a few blocks before his d^ 
ti nation so that he might stop to 
purchase a corsage. He pinned the 
exotic flowers, despite her mild ob- 
jections, to the shoulder of her 
brightly colored blouse. 

They entered noiselessly through 
the side door and quickly undressed. 
Afterwiard, he caressed her hair and 
spoke to her of intimate things, of 
his home, his loneliness, his conitri- 
tion for the wanton destruction of 
her city, of his gpaltitude to her. She 
smiled at him as she reached out for 
her purse. She bpened it and took 
out one of the ; small scanning de- 
vices issued % the Occupying 
Forces. 

He felt icy fingers close about his 
heart. 

“What are you doing?” he cried. 

“Reporting the transaction to 
your Computer,” she said, the word 
your heavily accented. “I should have 
recorded it in advance.” 

“But this wasn’t just a transac- 
tion,” he said. ‘It was one human 
being showing friendship to an- 
other.” 

She laughed outright. 

“Me?” she said. “Human?” 

He sat bolt upright in the bed. 

“What do you mean?” he said. 



“You even have parents! You said 
so.” 

^'Parents was just a euphemism 
for my owners,” she said. “I always 
give i^em Teiran food packages.” 

He went to the closet and gather- 
ed up her clothes. 

“Get the hell out of here,” he 
said. 

She dressed before him with ex- 
aggerated slowness, moving her body 
seductively in a caricature of sensu- 
ality. She curtsied grandly before 
she left, a grotesque mockery, he 
knew, of his Terran values. 

S he walked through the streets in 
a leisurely manner until she 
reached one of the city’s communi- 
cation centers. There she called her 
home, collect. Her mother’s face 
came alive on the visiscreen. It was 
without emotion. 

“I did it,” she told her mother. 
“He is humiliated and unnerved. I 
made him something less than a 
man.” 

“It was a courageous and patrio- 
tic thing to do,” said her mother. 
“And yet I wish the glory were be- 
ing garnered by someone else’s 
daughter.” 

Her mother’s face faded from the 
screen like a wraith of smoke. And 
then, after straightening die hem of 
her skirt and discarding ithe corsage, 
the girl walked out into the street 
looking for another Terran soldier.

DOWN UNDER 

by UN CARTER 

Our Man In Fandom 
travels 72,000 miles 
to the Fantipodes! 



P eople who read this column 
every month probably get the 
idea that science-<Ection fandom ex- 
ists only in America. Well, tlhat’s 
dead wmong. I know I tend to talk 
about American fans almost with- 
out exception, (but that’s only be- 
cajuse I’m more closely connected 
to it than to the many foreign fan- 
doms. Actually, people all over the 
wodd read science fiction, and a 
goodly numlber of them are fan- 
type people. Perhaps it would be 
a good idea if I did a little talking 
about them, for a change. 

Fans Down Under 

Let’s begin with Australia, the 
place the kangaroos and the duck- 
billed platypusses come from. I am 
beginning this Fandom-’Round-4he- 
World thing with Aussie-land for the 
very good reason that the Sixth Con- 
tinent is a veritable hotbed of fan- 
activity these days and seems to 



be crawling with avid science-fic- 
tion readers, collectors and fans of 
all descriptions. This is a fairly re- 
cent phenomenon, although there 
have been fans in Australia for as 
long as there has been science fio 
tion. But things went into the dol- 
drums about 1958, for some reason. 

The guy who touched off the 
current renaissance in Aussie fan- 
dom is named John Foyster. He or- 
ganized and conduct^ the Sev- 
enth Australian SF Convention in 
the dty of Melbourne around Eas- 
ter of 1966. As you can tell from 
the Convention’s official title, there 
have been over the years six other 
such cons. But the Melbourne af- 
fair was the first in about eight 
years, and it served to pull scattered 
fans together, bring new people into 
contact, and spark activity in gen- 
eral. John Foyster left for England 
early this year, and perhaps he can 
whip things into action there, too. 



47 




The Australian Science Fiction Review 

It was a combination of curious 
accidents that brought the current 
state of Australian fan-activity to 
my notice. The first thing that hap- 
pened was that Pat Terry, an eld- 
erly Australian fan, very fond of 
Andre Norton, was mov^ to write 
to me because of a brief study I 
wrote of Miss Norton’s books that 
appeared in some of the Ace paper- 
back reprints of her novels. We be- 
gan exchanging letters, and among 
other things he sent me two copies 
of a lively fan magazine called 
Australian Science Fiction Review, 
or ASFR for short. Then science- 
fiction writer James Blish sent me 
yet another copy. He received an 
extra of the current issue and, for 
want of a better idea, passed it along 
to me. Thus besieged with copies of 
ASFR arriving from all points of 
the compass (including yet another 
copy that ASFR’s editor, John Bang- 
sund, sent to me direct), I kinda had 
to read the thing. I found it lively, 
controversial and stimulating. 

The editor points out, in issue #5, 
that ASFR came about as a direct 
consequence of this Convention. 
And, since just about all the fans 
in or about Australia get ASFR 
regularly, it has served to draw 
them together and help them get 
organized. 

ASFR is not a heavy, lit’ry-type 
magazine by any means. The peo- 
ple who do the reviews are not of 
the persuasion that science fiction 
is either Serious Thought-Provoking 
Social Criticism or Scientific Pro- 
phecy (you know what I mean, the 
“Shape of Technologies to Come” 



sort of idea). They have the idea 
that SF is entertainment, to be read 
for fun. And they criticize on that 
basis. They tend a little towards the 
chop-it-up-in-little-pieces brand of 
reviewing and don’t spare the egos 
of the authors concerned. Oh, it’s 
lively stuff — and the authors have 
been howling, as in the current is- 
sue, when William F. Temple howls 
and Jim Blish registers a polite 
quibble or two with ASFR’s critique 
of his recent novel, The Hour Be- 
fore Earthrise. 

The Melbourne Science Fiction Club 

It would seem that Melbourne 
(which is not the capital of Aus- 
tralia) is certainly the SF center 
of the continent. Besides serving as 
the site of the Convention, and 
the home of ASFR, it boasts an SF 
fanclub of considerable activity. One 
of these activities — and one that 
I wish American fanclubs would 
adopt! — is holding regular screen- 
ings of science-fiction movies 
for club members. The Melbourne 
group is now trying to get copies 
of such movies as Fantastic Voy- 
age, George Pal’s Seven Faces of 
Doctor Lao and Truffaut’s version of 
the Ray Bradbury yarn, Fahrenheit 
451, for next year’s season. As you 
might imagine, such films bring a 
rare turnout of sf fans. 

The Melbourne group also have 
another feature that the American 
clubs universally lack: a library. In 
fact, Mervyn Binns (who writes up 
a monthly report on club doings for 
ASFR) claims it is one of “the 
most comprehensive collections in 
Australia.” They’ve been adding to 
the collection, which already in- 



48 



IF 




eludes books, paperbacks and close 
to one thousand sf magazines, at the 
astounding rate of more than 150 
books over a period of eight or nine 
months. Members, of course, have 
reading privileges . and, pre- 
sumably, iborrowing privileges. This 
is a great way for impecunious 
fans to catch up on their current 
reading, and I wish American clubs 
would adopt that notion too. 

Celebrities, Even! 

Nor is Australian fandom entire- 
ly made up of fans alone, as you 
might suppose. Plenty of profession- 
al science people make Australia 
their home. The late Dr. Paul Line- 
barger, for example, lived there for 
a nunober of years. If that name 
doesn’t ring any ibells with you, his 
famous penHoame was “Coidwainer 
Smith.” If you’ve iread many of his 
stories,* you’ll probably remember 
the planet “Norstrilia” — which was 
a contraction for “Old North Aus- 
tralia” and is an indication of his 
affection for the country. 

Then ithere is A. Bertram Chan- 
dler, author of all those “Rim world” 
stories, such as his recent If serial. 
The Road to the Rim. Bertram 
Chandler is, or was, a ship’s officer 
in the maritime service and makes 
his home in New South Wales. He 
has letters and brief articles scat- 
tered through the copies of ASFR 
that I have seen and seems to be 
a local celebrity. 

And a crop of new young writ- 
ers is rising Down Under. Such 
as Jack Wodhams, an expatriate 
Englishman; Ron Smith, an ex- 
patriate American and Australia’s 
own John Baxter, a home-grown 



local boy. There is utterly no doubt 
that John Baxter is an authentic 
Australian: he once had a pet buny- 
ip, and that’s as Australian as you 
can get! 

Baxter’s novel. The God Killers, 
is reprinted over here by Ace Books 
under the title of The Off-World- 
ers. I am intimately familiar with 
this particular novel, ibecause it’s 
half of an Ace “Double” and the 
novel on the other side is a Lin 
Carter effort called The Star Ma- 
gicians. I just slip this in casually. 

Booming professional writers all 
over the Australian landscape is 
something comparatively new, and 
must contribute quite a bit to the 
excitement of the sf renaissance 
now in the works down there in 
the Antipodes. Here in New York 
where I live, sf writerg, editors and 
cover artists are a part of the local 
scenery and hardly get noticed any 
more. (I recall the Saturday eve- 
ning my wife and I were coming out 
of a theatre on Times Square and 
bumped into Randall Garrett, James 
Blish and Sam Moskowitz, all in the 
space of about 20 minutes.) The 
New York fan clubs are pretty blase 
about it all ... so many profession- 
als drop around to the club meetings 
that their “celebrity” value has all 
but rubbed off by now . but it’s 
rather new to the Australian fans, 
and I suppose it’s pretty diverting. 

I thought I wouldn’t be able to 
cover the other fan movements in 
Italy, Germany, Scandinavia and 
elsewhere all in this one article, and 
I see I was right. So more about 
the foreign groups next month.

The Silkies were Earth's only 
defense against a foe who had 



already defeated them once! 



I 

W hen the Silkie call for help 
came, Nat Cemp, tiimself a 
Silkie, was exploring ithe planet 
which had been given the astronomi- 
cal designation Minus 1109-93 . 
the 1109th planet farther away than 
Earth from the new, mighty sun, of 
which Earth had become one small, 
green, planetary part, reveloving at 



an angle of 93 ° in relation to Earth’s 
orbit. 

It was a temporary nomenola- 
ture. No one took the attitude that 
Earth was the most important planet 
of the new system. 

Not, apparently, that it was going 
to matter. On the three planets that 
had been assigned to Cemp — 1107, 
1108 and now 1109 — there were 
no detectable inhabitants. He had 



51 




been skimming for nearly half a 
day among the strange, slender 
buildiinigs which reared Mke stretched 
laodwork itowaid ithe siky. And al- 
ready it was sadly obvious ithait here, 
also, the transition period had been 
ifcoo long for life to survive. Perhaps 
only Earth and the few others al- 
ready discovered had been able to 
make the changeover. 

The call for help came as Cemp 
was (floating through a vast genera- 
tor building complex. Clear and 
sharp and urgent, he picked it up 
from the mechanical relay system 
between 1109 and 1110. 

It said, “AM Silkies and govern- 
ment agencies: I have just received 
a (Silkie word) message from Lan 
Jedd.” 

The special Silkie “word” was a 
thought-form that was used to des- 
cribe an after-death Silkie communi- 
cation phenomenon. As a Silkie 
descended into death, there was a 
threshold point at which an isolated 
neural bundle was activated. The 
bundle was a telepathic sender; and 
it, quite simply, transmitted ithe final 
living thoughts, perceptions and feel- 
ings of a SMkie who, at the -time the 
message was sent, was already dead. 

T he name of the dead SMkie, .thus 
relayed, shocked Cemp. For 
Lan Jedd and he had been os much 
Mends as any two SMkies ever were, 
or rather ever were allowed to be. 
Human beings and particularly the 
Special People — humans iwho could 
communicate tdepathicaMy with 
Silkies — had always diswuraged 
Silkie-with-Silkie associations. 

Lan and he had chosen to ex- 



plore adjoining sets of planets at 
this remote end of the system in 
order to have relatively unmonitored 
discussions about the increasing 
severity of the SMkie-human prob- 
lem. 

So for Cemp, as the message 
reached him, the shocking thrill- 
thought came: except for the sender, 
he himself was the nearest “help.’* 

He responded at once with: “Nat 
Cemp coming immediately. Who are 
you?” 

“Ou-Dan! Calling from 1113-86.” 

The identification of the sender 
was disturbing. It was a name of 
the type and style common to 
meteorite Silkies, whosei existence 
had ibeen unknown until less than 
a year ago. The presence of such 
“original” Silkies in tibiq vastly larger 
sun system was an unknown, un- 
resolved factor . which Cemp 
and Lan Jedd had also talked about 
in great detail. 

Startling to consider that, perhaps, 
Ou-Dan had “listened in” to their 
discussion. 

But what especiaMy disturbed 
Cemp was that he had no confidence 
in the fighting abilities of these new- 
ly arrived SMkies. It meant that for 
many hours he would be virtually 
ajone against a mysterious, power- 
ful enemy who had already proved 
himself strong enough to kMl a SM- 
kie. 

As he had these awarenesses, 
Cemp was projeotinig himsdf out 
of the buMding he was in. Moments 
later he was rising out of the at- 
mosphere by means of his Silkie 
method of gravitation reversal.

body which, in his C-Silkie form, 
was almost bullet-shaped and ten 
feet long. In this form it was a 
body that was fully able to operate 
and live in the vacuum of space. 

Once away from the planet, Cemp 
maintained his expulsion momentum 
and moved through space by cutting 
off gravity from all objects in space 
except in the direction he wanted 
to go. Thus the outer planets drew 
him, and he “fell” with ever in- 
creasing speed toward his destina- 
tion, a special “ship.” 

In spite of his initial acceleration, 
it was the usual slow journey of a 
Silkie traveling by himself through 
space. And so it was several anxious 
hours later before at last he saw 
the ship in the dark space ahead. 

T he ship was a defensive vessel 
that had been built as part of 
a crash program after the disaster 
of Earth becoming part of the new 
sun system. Built without walls, 
utilizing weapons as modern as what 
Cemp had learned from the Glis, 
it and others like it were part of 
the safety measures set up in con- 
junction with exploring so many new 
and unknown planets. 

As soon as he was securely in con- 
trol of the ship, Cemp started it 
toward Ou-Dan, a distance of only 
four planets. Which was no problem 
at all to the fast ship. 

Once under way, Cemp allowed 
its relay sender to activate again. 
Thus he tuned into oommunications 
which were already in progress from 
more remote points: Silkies specu- 
lating telepathically about what had 
happened. 



What a powerful life-form that 
particular planet which Lan Jedd 
had been exploring must have, if 
one or even several of them could 
kill a fully grown Silkie like Lan. 
That was the general thought. From 
all over the system converging Silkies 
readied for a mass battle with a 
dangerous opponent. 

Unfortunately, it would be quite 
a while before these more distant 
helpers arrived on the scene. For 
at least an earth day, Ou-Dan and 
he would be the only living beings 
on or near the scene of the crime. 

Arriving at ship speed, Cemp 
learned that the dead Silkie body 
had been taken by Ou-Dan over to a 
meteorite, which circled 1113-86. 

The strange bright-dark of space 
with its black “sky” and the huge, 
faraway sun glaring with a thousand 
reflected brilliances from every 
rock and metal facet of the meteorite 
— that was the backdrop. 

In such a vast frame, ithe shat- 
tered Silkie body seemed like an 
atom in infinity. It lay sprawled on 
a flat spread of rock. In death it 
bore an even vaguer resemblance 
to a human being than in life. There 
Wias a sort of leg separation at the 
rear, and up front was a caricature 
of a human face. 

No indication of how the des- 
truction had been done. Ou-Dan 
commented telepathic^ly that the 
body looked collapsed. But it was 
not much smaller than normal: 
eight inches at most. 

As Cemp gazed silently down at 
his dead friend, he thought: Tbe 
worst possible had happened. A 
highly trained adult Silkie, with ail

tihait implied in aleritnieiss and laibility 
to istilize poweitM defensive and 
offensive energies, bad been oon- 
fronted by another beong. 

And ithe Silkiie bad been defeated 
and killed. 

O u-Dan, looking a little like an 
elongated meteorite ihiimseiLf, 
telepathed: “Lan bad just reported 
to me that there were no inbabiitants 
surviving on 1110, 1111 and 1112, 
and I, working backwards, bad 
found the same s&tuiaition on 1115, 
1114 and 1113, wben his after-death 
message came.” 

Cemp thought: A dead Silkie, and 
only one clue: thiat single flash of 
communication from the mature and 
powerful Lan Jedd, instants after he 
died. 

... A mental picture of a pyra- 
midal shape and the thought: It 
came from nowhere, from nothing. 

Cemp felt a chill as he contem- 
plated the fantastic implications of 
the message. The immense speed of 
the attack . out of nowhere. 
Presently, Cemp telepathed to Ou- 
Dan: “Why don’t you come with 
me and we’ll wait in the ship? Its 
weapons will help us if we’re at- 
tacked.” 

Ou-Dan followed Cemp into an 
alcove barrier at the heart of the 
mac^hinery that made uip the “ship.” 
“But I’m not staying,” he said. 
Cettnp sensed behind the decision, 
not antagonism, but disinterest. 

Ou-Dan’s thought came again: “I 
remained with Lan’s dead body out 
of courtesy till someone arrived. 
Now, that you’re here, I plan to re- 
turn to Earth.” 



“It’s safer in the ship,” Cemp 
urged. 

He pointed out that it was an 
Earth Silkie maxim never to take 
unnecessary chances. Ou-Dan’s plan 
to go out by himself into space 
seemed a risk of this kind. 

“It would be purely accidental,” 
was the reply, “If I met .the killer 
in these vast reaches. My guess is he 
spotted Lan when he used the relay 
system to communicate with me. 
As I see it, the closer you are to a 
ship, (the greater your danger.” 

The analysis had its own reason- 
ableness. But why, since Ou-Dan 
had joined the exploration group in 
the first place, leave now? Cemp 
asked the question. 

Ou-Dan said that because of 
Cemp’s action in saving the meteo- 
rite Silkies from the Glis eight 
months ‘before, Ou-Dan felt obli- 
gated to tell him that he considered 
this to be a crisis. But .truth was it 
was probably typical of the many 
crises that would occur in the future 
in a new system comprising eighteen 
hundred and twenty-three habitable 
planets. So the time to resolve Silkie 
rights in relation to human beings 
was now. 

Ou-Dan predicted that the Silkie 
originals would undoubtedly take no 
further action until their legal situ- 
ation with Earth was settled. 

“The others and I came out to 
get the feel of being involved,” said 
Ou-Dan. “So I can tell you right 
now that we’re not going .to settle 
for being police officers like you. 
And of course we’re not going to 
give up our ability to change to any 
form or shape of body. 



54 



IF 




“After tail,” Ou-Dan conitinued 
toleranitly, “just because you’re lim- 
ited to the Silkfle4n mmia.n cycle 
doesn’t mean we have to be.’’ 

They had been tialLldinig mentally 
at the siiper-sipeied of thoughts syn- 
chronized with magnetic carrier 
waves. It would have aotuaJly requir- 
ed a small book for a transcriipt of 
the details of itheir messages to each 
other; the overtones were that many. 

Now, for the period required for 
a private thought, Cemp put up a 
barrier. 

The fantastic subject of change of 
form was not one that he was pre- 
pared to discuss with anyone. 

In fact, he had instructions from 
the Silkie Foundation (to keep secret 
his special knowledge. 

T he original Silkies — like Ou- 
Dan — had a ibiaaic ability to 
change into any living shape or form 
that could contain, expand or com- 
press the total numiber of molecules 
involved. It need not be merely a 
human form. Theara was^ however, 
an elementary level itiansformaition, 
beginniing with a general internal 
and external resemblance — not too 
refined but adequate for any reason- 
able purpose. In addition, in the 
presence of a life-form, they could 
by a continuous rapid scanning and 
feedback method duplicate it at vir- 
tually any level of refinement — 
so long as the being who was dupli- 
cated was dose by. 

Earth Sdlldes, on the other hand, 
had been biolo^icalliy limi^ to 
human^ilkie B-S^e C chani^ 
which was automatic once it was 
8^ in motion. 

ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



Only Nat Cemp, of the Earth 
Silkies, could go beyond the Sillde- 
human cycle. 

In confronting the remarkable 
Kibmadine, he had learned its per- 
fect method of metamorphic ability. 
He needed only the memory of 
somebody once met to be able to 
become that being with total dup- 
lication. 

Having had (these thoughts, and 
hidden them, Cemp tdepathed in a 
temporizing way, “Don’t underesti- 
mate human beings.” 

“I won’t,” retorted Ou-Dan, “so 
long as they have you fooled into 
being on their side.” 

Cemp said, “Even with the 6,000 
origmal Silkies added to our own 
numbers, the total Silkie population 
of the entire universe is less than 
8,000. Such a minority has to ad- 
just to the vast planetary popula- 
tions of other lifenforms.” 

Ou-Dan said, “I don’t have to ad- 
just to anything. I’m free to do as I 
please.” 

Cemp said, “All througih human 
history, wherever ipeople got the 
right to make their own choices, 
they presently refused to cooperate 
even for the common good. Soon, 
each person set himself up as having 
an opinion as good as anybody 
eJse’s. Naturally, they first of all soon 
fell under ithe influence of individuals 
with skillful systems and in the end 
were maneuvered into a new 
slavery. Now, here you are making 
the same error of refusing to co- 
operate.” 

“Let others cooperate with us,” 
was the reply. “We’re the superior 
beings.” 



55 




“M we were so great,” Cemp 
flashed back, “bow come tbeie’re 
so few of us left?” 

“Weil — ” Ou-Dan was impati- 
ent — “we were unlucky tbat we 
ran into a race witb even more 
capabiiliiity than we bad. At least, 
that’s the legend. And of course after 
that we were in that meteorite xmder 
the control of the Glis, and our num- 
bers were kept limited.” 

C emp pointed out gently that con- 
trol of Silkies by the Glis was 
the slave condition. “Therefore,” he 
said, “we may deduce that long 
ago Silkies reached the state of re- 
fusing to cooperate for the common 
good. We can picture enormous, 
vaulting egos, opinionated and ri- 
diculous, never once having a true 
survival thought. 

“We can,” Cemp continued, “pic- 
ture Silkies refusing to abide by 
any system of law, going out into 
space if anyone threatened them. 
Feeling absolutely impregnable. And 
then one day out there in the dark 
reaches they met their match, and 
were hunted down one by one by a 
remorseless enemy.” 

“I don’t see,” said Ou-Dan, “how 
we free Silkies can even talk to 
someone as conformist as you are.” 
“Reliable is the word,” answered 
Cemp. “I can be trusted to do what 
I say. Evidently you and your orig- 
inals cannot even decide what role 
you want to play.” 

“Why should we have a role? 
Why should we work at all, at any- 
thing? Why shouldn’t human beings 
work for us instead of we few* them? 
That’s a perfectly fair question.” 



Cemp exfriained that human beings 
seemed t>o be easily surviving their 
present association with Silkies. But 
this might not be true if the con- 
ditions of association were altered. 

Ou-Dan seemed indifferent to the 
possibility. And Cemp realized it was 
a lot to expect that someone who 
had had no previous contact with 
human beings would care about 
them. But Cemp, who had been bom 
to a human mother, did care. So 
he said, with the intent of ending 
the discussion, “We’ll have a general 
meeting soon. We’ll talk then.” 

Such a meeting had already been 
proposed by Charley Baxter, head 
of the Silkie Foundation. Baxter, 
who was one of the Special Peo- 
ple, was as anxious about the atti- 
tude of the original Silkies as Cemp. 

Ou-Dan accepted the end of con- 
versation with: “I have nothing more 
to learn here. Good-by.” 

Whereupon he launched into 
space, and was quickly lost from 
view. Presently, he did not even 
register on the magnetic band as 
any different from the meteorite 
flotsam and jetsam that populated 
all areas of space. 

U 

I n this distant point in space, with 
all the trigger systems for the 
“ship” set for instant reaction, Cemp 
waited for he knew not what. 

The open-to-space ship was itself 
lightless. Artificial light on any level 
"interfered with the sensitive instm- 
ments that monitored the protective 
weaponry. It was enough problem 
for the equipment around him that 

IF 



56 




he himself had to be taken account 

of. 

Periodically, Cemp made a com- 
plete check of that equipment. He 
established each time that every re- 
lay was ready to snap and that each 
device was separately set to permit 
the presence of his Sihde shape and 
mass and of that portion of his life 
energy which he could not contain 
within himself. 

While he waited, Cemp gazed 
“down” in the general direction of 
Earth. 

The view below him had the for- 
ever-new quality of light and form 
that had passed a threshold point of 
abundance. There were so many, 
many brilliant planetary lights in 
the dark sky of Earth’s new super- 
sun system. The sheer number of 
planets, each with a different colora- 
tion, made for a timeles^y beautiful 
panorama. 

For Cemp, it was below and down 
because he had long ago oriented 
himself in such human terms. In 
his Silkie body he always operated 
at what would have been face down 
in a human being. So he had a right 
and a left, a front and a back, and 
an up and down. 

In the several conversations that 
he conducted with far Earth, Cemp 
could obtain no additional advice 
as to any other precautions he might 
take. No one believed that way out 
there at the remote edge of the sys- 
tem any living being could approach 
him, unnoticed. 

Yet what Lan Jedd reported, in- 
dicated that there would be no ad- 
vance warning. 

There wasn’t. 



A t the moment of the attack, Cemp 
had waited in the ship exactly 
four Earth hours, ei^teen minutes 
and forty-two seconds. 

The being who lat that time for 
a few split-instants was exposed to 
Cemp’s perception had the shape 
of an inverted p5rramid. Interesting 
that in the transmission of the same 
image from the now deceased Lan 
Jedd, the invert had not come 
through. The transmiting computer, 
consulting its analogs, had produced 
a pyramid stereotype wherein the 
base was down and the point up. 

In fact, the base was up and the 
point down. 

That was all Cemp had time to 
“see,” for the creature was in the 
trap only momentarily. A less speedy 
perception than that of a Silkie 
would have noticed at best a shadow 
darkening a lighted space. 

Despite the colossal speed of the 
being’s withdrawal, Cemp with his 
heightened Silkie perception was able 
to examine awareness centers in him- 
self that had automatically recorded 
more data. Thus Cemp continued to 
view where it had been through a 
series of neural and energy recep- 
tors that played back their informa- 
tion for his evaluation. 

He realized, fascinated: During 
the moment it was in the trap, the 
creature attacked and tried to kill 
him. 

But he was saved by the defenses 
of the trap. 

A strong impulse came to study 
the battle, to discover immediately 
what it was that had made him 
vulnerable, why his own screens 
wouldn’t have worked. 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



57 




Cemp fought that impulse, think- 
ing: Put the battle aside. Examine 
it kst 

For an attack was only that — 
energy, force, whatever. It was the 
Nijjan method of approaching the 
trap that everybody down the line 
wanted to know about. Where had 
the fantastic thing come from? 

Studying the after-images, Cemp 
saw with amazement that the pyra- 
mid shape was actually an energy 
projection from a source. 

The being at the source he could 
not get a good look at; it withdrew 
so rapidly. 

Considerang the “impossible” 
speed of that withdrawal, he re- 
caHod a scientifically oriented specu- 
lative discussion he had had with 
other Silkies about his encounter 
with the Glis. Now, he felt that 
Oils experience again in his mind 
— and that wasn’t it. 

The discovery appalled him. For 
what he had perceived had been 
something; and then it was nothing. 

Something to nothing. Nothing to 
something to nothing. 

What could it be? 

C emp had one receptor that had 
on it a vague perception. So 
vague that it gained reality only 
because he played it for himself a 
dozen times, and even then it re- 
mained unclear. But with so many 
replays he had an impression, if so 
it could be called, that the energy 
point which was the apparent source 
of the inverted pyramid had anoth^ 
point at some vasit distance beyond 
it. And behind — beyond — that 
point was still another point, and 



beyond that w>ther, and more 
points in the vaster distance. Or 
was it distance? Cemp couldn’t de- 
cide. 

After viewing and re-viewing the 
perceptic impression, so shadowy 
and uncertain, he consciously com- 
pared what he saw to an endless 
image reflected in two perfect mir- 
rors facing each other. 

But even that was only an analogy. 
Because the images extended into 
only one mirror and not the other. 
It was a one-direction phenomenon. 

It was a mystery which he could 
not solve; so, unes^y, he turned his 
attention to the life-and-deaith battle 
he had fought. 

Like the other aspects of that 
momentary contact, the engagement 
could only be studied in its con- 
fusing aftermath. Examined thus, 
it showed as having started the 
split-instant that the creature ar- 
rived. The trap, consisting in its 
first phase of a Glis^type molecule 
with the gravity power of a planet, 
had instantaneously oriented to the 
enemy. 

It was instantaneous because, of 
course, gravity has no lag; there is 
no moment of waiting while it goes 
through a process of adjustment. 

The molecule, that remarkable 
discovery of the ancient nature of 
matter the secret of which Cemp 
had gotten from the Glis, reached 
with the power of an entire world 
— and attached itself to the alien. 

Hindered him. 

The attacker, thus handicapped, 
nevertheless did something. What, 
Cemp had no idea. AH Cemp’s great 
defenses were up: his energy 



58 



IF 




screens, his magnetic methods of 
turning aside radiation, what he had 
learned from the Kibmadine about 
using attack energy against the at- 
tacker. 

But the attack was not on an en- 
ergy band. Cemp’s defenses had no 
effect. 

— He felt a change in his whole 
body, a sudden sense of inward-col- 
lapsing distortion .... 

His thought twisted strangely. Un- 
able to put up a single barrier, 
Cemp felt himself spin toward 
death — 

The next split-moment the crea- 
ture, hindered by the molecule, dis- 
appeared. 

And the battle was over. 

4 

m 

U rgently, Cemp opened a line to 
Earth. He was quickly deluged 
with questions. 

And someone had the same 
thought as he had had: that the 
pyramid was a weapon that operated 
through some mirror principle from 
an actual distance. Thus — it was 
argued — the effect of nothing to 
something to nothing was like a mir- 
ror being turned on and off in the 
time it took a relay to push-pull a 
switch. 

“No!” answered Cemp. “It was a 
life-form. I sensed its aliveness.” 
That ended that part of the argu- 
ment right there. 

Qiarley Baxter came on. “Your 
data is being fed into the compu- 
ter, Nat,” he said gravely. “While 
we wait, would you like to speak 
to your wife?” 



“Of course, what do you think.” 
Joanne’s thought, when it came 
through, reflected irritation. “Every- 
body’s so damned secretive about 
what you’re doing,” she began. 

So they hadn’t told her his danger. 
Cemp was relieved. 

“Look,” he telepathed, “we’re ex- 
ploring out here and testing a new 
ship. That’s all Fm allowed to say.” 
It was a truth of sorts. He added, 
“What have you been up to?” 

His attempt at diverting her was 
successful. Joanne became indignant. 
“I have had the most horrible ex- 
perience,” she reported. 

What she told him was that Sil- 
kie women — members of the orig- 
inal Silkies — had called on the hu- 
man wives of Earth Silkies and urged 
them to divorce their Silkie hus- 
bands. Such a Silkie woman had 
called on Joanne and demanded that 
she divorce Cemp. 

The Silkie woman had pointed out 
bluntly that Cemp as a Sillde would 
live to be at least a thousand years 
old. And, of course, Joanne was 
more mortal than that by fat. 

“So — ” the Silkie woman had 
urged — “why not face the reality 
of that now, while you are still 
young?” 

Cemp had the unhappy feeling 
that the problem was more severe 
than Joanne knew. A thousand years 
was as long as the Glis, for its own 
reasons, had allowed meteorite Sil- 
kies to live. A Silkie’s actual life 
span was an unknown. 

Yet he had always fdt that these 
matters would be resolved in their 
own good time. Joanne was under 
thirty. Her present life expectancy 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



59 




was about one hundred and fifty. 
Long before she readied that age, 
human immortality might become 
possible. 

Questioning her, he discovered 
that Joanne had toughly pointed out 
all these things to the Silkie 
woman and had given as much as 
she received. 

I t was not a moment for Cemp 
to consider what changes might 
come in the Silkie^human tangle. He 
telepaithed with wairmth, “Don’t 
worry about any of this. You’re my 
darling.” 

“That’s a powerful point,” said 
Joanne sweetly. “But don’t think 
you’ve fooled me for a moment. I 
sense there’s a big event coming up 
in your life, and you’re taking it in 
stride as usual.” 

“Well — ” Cemp began. 

“It’s really an unresolvable dilem- 
ma,” answered Joanne. 

“What is?” Cemp asked, in sur- 
prise. 

Cemp quickly realized -that 
Joanne’s concern was not with the 
danger but, of all things, with the 
fact he was not afraid. She said, 
almost tearfully, “If you feel so con- 
fident against such a mighty enemy 
— what’s going to become of Silkie- 
human relations?” 

“Meaning, I presume,” said Cemp, 
“that Silkies don’t need humans any 
more?” 

“Well, do they?” 

Cemp explain^ patiently, “In the 
first place, my confidence is in Logic 
of Levels, and not in myself.” 
Joanne brushed that aside. “It’s 
the same ithing. Logic of Levels is a 



tool that you can use whether you’re 
associated with humans or not” 
“In the second place, ” Cemp re- 
plied, “I don’t even know yet 
whether I’m going to dare use it 
though I’m certainly going to threa- 
ten it.” 

“You’ll be forced to. And then 
you’ll win, and there you’ll be at 
an incredible height of power and 
ability.” 

“In the ithird place,” Cemp con- 
tinued, “the association between Sil- 
kies and humans exists. And I’m 
particularly happy with what I got 
out of the transaction — meaning 
you.” He broke off. “Do I seem any 
smarter?” 

“N-no.” 

“I.Q. human level, eh, stiM?” 

“I suppose so.” Reluctant admis- 
sion. 

“I stiU seem to reason like a hu- 
man being, correct?” 

“But you’re so powerful.” 
“Perhaps you should think of me 
as a battleship commander,” said 
Cemp. “In this instance, the battle- 
ship is my Silkie body, and you’re 
the commander’s beloved wife.” 

The comparison seemed to buoy 
her, for her mind smiled at him, 
and she said, “They’re motioning 
me to stop, and I still love you, 
but good-hy, my dear.” 

Her conuminication ceased. 

C harley Baxter came on. “The 
computer,” he said, and there 
was concern in his thought, “was re- 
minded by your data of something 
you reported months ago; something 
the Gliis told you during its death 
throes.”

Cemp remembered: The Glis, re- 
alizing that Cemp was a dangerous 
SilJde, had headed toward a remote 
sttar system. This system — ac- 
cording to what the Glis had told 
Cemp in its final, desperate effort 
to save itself — was inhabited by 
an ancient enemy of the Silkies. 

These beings called themselves 
Nijjans. Which was a race name 
with the mighty meaning: Creators 
of Universes. Or, in its fullest sense: 
The People Who Know the Nature 
of Things and Can Create Uni- 
verse at Will. 

As Cemp une^y pondered the 
hideous possibilifiife' if the analysis 
were true, Baxter!|^)icfeued in an 
arguing overtone, the Glis was 

going somewhere. You did get 
alarmed and you threaded him. As 
you described it, thd" Glis slowed 
down and tried to make his pi^e 
with you. So that whatever system 
he was pointing toward must be out 
there iq the direction he was going, 
not too far away.” 

Since astronomers had gotten a 
line on Sol, Earth’s former sun, 
they had already projected a line 
fairly straight at the Glis’s originial 
destination somewhere in near space. 

“And,” said Baxter, “the system 
is out there about six light-years 
beyond you, Nat.” 

Such details were, of course, of 
interest. But Cemp was under too 
much threat for anything but the ab- 
solutely decisive points to matter. 

He telepathed hastily, “Does the 
computer have any idea how the 
Nijjan killed Lan? Or how I should 
handle him if he comes back with 
reinforcements?” 



Baxter’s disturbed reply came. 
“Nat, this is a terrible thing to tell 
someone in your situation. But the 
computer hasn’t the faintest idea 
how the thing came out of nothing- 
ness or what the force used against 
Lan and you was. It says it has no 
programming that fits and — ” 

That was all Cemp had time to 
receive. 

, At that precise split-instant, the 
perceptors that he had projected be- 
yond the Nijjan’s first relay point 
were triggered. 

Since he had a communication 
line open to Earth, he allowed his 
recording of danger to go through 
him and along that line. 

The esSwiitial of communication 
that he Ihlllis instantly passed along 
was: The Nijjan is back . before 
I’m ready. 

IV 

I t seemed like long, long before. 

There the creature was, in much 
the same position as the first time: 
partly inside the ship, a hundred 
feet away. 

But alone! That was the one hope- 
ful aspect. 

The inverted pyramidal projection 
glimmered with flickering energy 
pulsations. 

Cemp now saw that the actual 
being at the source of the projection 
was also an inverted pyramid — in 
a way. The base was much narrow- 
er. And it had, he observed, arms 
and legs. It was about six feet long, 
and beautiful in that its hard, bright 
skin glittered and shone with chang- 
ing color.

IF 




At the instant of the alien’s ar- 
rival, the Glis molecule tried to at- 
tach itself. But the Nijjan was evi- 
dently prepared; for he balanced 
himself against it, somehow. 

And thereafter ignored the mole- 
cule. 

Cemp grew aware that the crea- 
ture was looking at him intently 
from one or more of the bright 
points at the upper part of its body. 
Tentatively, Cemp sent a thought 
on a magnetic wave. 

The answer came at once on the 
same wave band; came with multi- 
ples more force than Cemp was 
accustomed to receiving. Yet he had 
his own neural transformers that 
stepped the power down to his 
level — 

And he had his first communica- 
tion. 

The creature began: “Let’s have . 
a conversation.” 

“You have a lot to explain,” 
Cemp thought back, grimly. 

“We’re puzzled,” was the reply. 
“Suddenly a Nova-Osize appears on- 
ly a few light-years from our own 
system. On investigation, we discover 
that the system which has so sud- 
denly come into being is the largest 
planetary family, possibly, in the 
galaxy. Only a few of the planets 
are inhabited. But many have been 
in the past and are no longer so. 
Climactically, one of our exploring 
units meets a Silkie, a powerful be- 
ing known from our antiquity as an 
enemy. He naturally destroys this 
being.” 

Said Cemp, “We shall require your 
people to execute this explorer who 
so instantly — and naturally — took 



it upon himself to destroy a Silkie.” 
“It was an ancient reflex, which 
has now been modified,” was the 
reply. “So execution will not occur. 
It could have happened to any Nij- 
jan.” 

“Did you do it?” Cemp asked. 
“Are you this — what did you 
call him? — exploring unit?” 
“Would it matter?” 

“Probably not.” 

The Nijjan changed the subject, 
“What do you Silkies do in relation 
to human beings? What is your 
role?” 

“We’re police.” 

“Oh! That’s interesting.” 

Cemp couldn’t see how. Besides 
his attention was still concentrated 
on the other’s explanation for the 
killing of Lan Jedd. 

C emp admitted reluctantly to him- 
self that if an attack reflex 
had indeed been set up long ago 
in all these creatures, and never 
canceled, it would be difficult to 
adjudicate intentional murder. 

But his next communication 
acknowledged none of this, as he 
continued: “All right, so here we 
are, accidentally doomed to occupy 
a space only a few light-years from 
each other. And we have eighteen 
hundred habitable planets. How 
many do you have?” 

“That’s a difficult question to 
answer. We don’t think in terms .of 
having a planet of our own. But I 
sense this is a difficult concept for 
you, so I’ll say we probably do own 
one planet — our original home.” 
“Do you want any more,” 

“Not in the sense that you mean. 

63 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 




All tjiis is too new. But our basic 
purposes are peaceful.*’ 

Cemp didn’t believe him. 

It sihould have 'been true. The 
passing of the eons sihould have 
ended old impulses of hatred and 
destruction. On Earth, a thousand 
descendants of enemies of an equal 
number of yesteryears now lived 
side by side, at peace apparently 
forever. 

Of course, this was not quite the 
same. The Nijjans were not descen- 
dants. They were the same beings 
who, long ago indeed, had attained 
the heights of their civilization and 
also immortality. These were the 
same creatures that had in the dis- 
tant past hated and sought to ex- 
terminate the Silkies — so the GHs 
had told Cemp. 

In that olden time, desiring to 
have the Silkies as servants, the 
mighty Glis had offered them a 
symbiotic relationship as the price 
for saving them. And the Silkies had 
accepted. 

But that, with the transformation 
and defeat of the Glis, was now 
over. And the Silkies were again 
on their own. They could expect 
no help from any outside source. 

It was a shaking thought. But 
Cemp was unrelenting. “I can’t ac- 
cept your disclaimer,” he said. “Be- 
cause why, when you first arrived 
here, presumably with your attack 
reflt'x already canceled, did you try 
to kill me?” 

The Nijjan’s reply was: “It was 
a defensive act. Something grabbed 
me. 1 see now that it is an unusual 
gravitational manifestation. But in 
that first moment I reacted in two 



ways: Immediate counter-attack. 

And retreat. As soon as I had con- 
sidered what the threat was, I de- 
cided to return. And here I am. So 
let’s talk.” 

It was a good explanation. Yet 
Cemp’s feeling remained: he didn’t 
believe the story. 

Couldn’t accept it. Considered it 
motivated by the Nijjan’s’ desire to 
gain time .... He had a desperate 
conviction that his danger was in- 
creasing with each passing moment. 

Cemp wondered: What does he 
want the time for? 

The obvious answer: Time to ex- 
plore the ship, of course. Its struc- 
ture, its weaponry. 

“If what you say is true,” Cemp 
countered, “then you will tell me 
what your method of attack was. 
How did your colleague kill a Sil- 
kie?” 

“It would be foolish of me to re- 
veal my advantages,” answered the 
Nijjan. “How do I know what your 
plans are?” 

Though that, also, was basically 
true, it was a total stop to discus- 
sion. 

Yet there were still things he could 
learn. 

C emp sent out magnetic waves on 
all bands, designed to stir re- 
actions in the other’s body. He re- 
corded the information ithat came 
back on magnetic waves passing 
through the Nijjan’s 'body at the 
time his messages arrived. 

He used radar and (read the data 
that bounced back. 

— And geon waves, those strange 
time-delay patterns. 



64 



IF 




— He used the Ylem energy, al- 
S9 — and that was dangerously 
close to being a weapon. But his 
purpose, which he telepathed to the 
Nijjan, was to elicit a reaction. 

If there was, in fact, any under- 
standing for him in the waves and 
energies that reflected or came back 
to him, Cemp could not analyze it. 

With an effort, Cemp braced 
himself against the failure, and 
commanded, “Leave! Unless you re- 
veal the method of murder, I refuse 
to continue this conversation. And I 
assure you that no further negoti- 
ations between our two groups can 
occur until that revelation is made.” 

The Nijjan answered, “I cannot 
give such data without authoriza- 
tion. So why not come with me and 
talk to — ” He used a mental 
meaning that implied a government 
but had a different, additional im- 
plication, which Cemp could not 
evaluate. 

Cemp answered, “That would 
place me at your mercy.” 

“Somebody has to negotiate. Why 
not you?” 

One thing, it seemed to Cemp, 
could be said for this Nijjan. As a 
deceiver, if that were what he was, 
he was certainly consistent. 

Telepathicaily, he temporized: 
“How would I go with you?” 

“Move past me, across and into 
the proj^on of myself at a dis- 
tance of — ” The Nijjan named a 
measurement in terms of a certain 
magnetic wavelength. 

Once more, Cemp felt grudging 
admiration for this being. He 
thought: For all I know, that will 
be his method of killing me. 



What was fascinating was that he 
was being maneuvered into doing It 
to himself. 

The extreme skillfulness of the 
deception involved was what, in 
tills near-ultimate moment, focused 
Cemp’s attention on that aspect. 

A s he realized the possibility, 
Cemp did two things. 

He sent a beam to the trap me- 
chanism which controlled the mole- 
cule with its planet-sized gravity; 
and released the molecule’s hold on 
the Nijjan. 

The rationale of this first action 
was: the being must be bracing him- 
self against that gravity, was using 
power to hold himself away from 
it. At the moment of release, he 
would have to deal with the resul- 
tant inertia, the equivalent of a 
planet’s centrifugal thrust. 

The second thing Cemp did was 
more subtle, but he did it at the 
same instant. 

He tried Logic of Levels on the 
one behavior that he had now be- 
latedly noticed in the Nijjan. 

And, because he wasn’t sure it 
would work, and didn’t want to give 
away what, until now, had been a 
human-Silkie secret, he hoped the 
gravity release would confuse the 
great being who had come into this 
trap with such toital confidence in 
his own ability against Silkies — 
confuse the Nijjan, render 'him mo- 
mentarily vulnerable and, somehow, 
prevent disaster. 

The behavior Cemp believed he 
had observed was the creature 
manifesting the famous betrayal pat- 
tern. 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



65 




From the point of view of Logic 
of Levels, it was a minioir event in 
the brain. Since it was the basic 
■mnning cyde of life, nothing de- 
cisive could be done against it. 

By triggering it, he could force 
the Nijjan to win more. 

— Which was pretty ironic and 
could lead to unknown consequences. 

But it was the only opening avail- 
able. 

Three things happened at the same 
moment: 

The molecule released. The be- 
trayal cycle triggered. Cemp entered 
the path of the energy beam, which 
created the larger pyramid. 

He felt a sensation different from 
anything he had ever experienced. 

Under him and around him, the 
trap-ship . vanished. 

He perceived that he was in a 
strange — not place, for there was 
nothing. But . what? 

V 

I n a group, only the leader can 
betray. And he must betray, or 
be ready to betray, or there is no 
group. 

Everyone else has to conform, fit 
in, follow the rules, be a supporter 
without qualifications. Even to think 
an objection is wrong. You must 
swear fealty to the leader “with- 
out mental reservations.” 

You must support the code and 
ideally report to the leader’s police 
any deviations from it on the part 
of others, and on the part of your- 
self. 

Alt any moment for the good of 
the group — by the leader’s judg- 



ment alone — you can be betrayed 
(saoiifLced) wiithouit any other ex- 
planation being required. 

Periodically, you or some other 
conformist must be betrayed as a 
matter of policy, even if you have 
not deviat^ from the code by any 
previously applied standard of judg- 
ment. 

The leader’s act of betrayal (of 
you) of itself makes you guilty. 

Immediately every other person 
in the group must disconnect from 
you without mental reservations. 

The rule of betrayal by the leader 
alone applies under any group sys- 
tem, including the elective — where 
the leader’s immediate aides are his 
group. 

As a group grows larger, the 
leader delegates his betrayal rights 
to unevenly qualified persons, who 
act in his name. Where this pro- 
cess (of delegation) continues and 
expands, there are alleviations be- 
cause not every sub-leader is as 
sensitive to the danger of non-con- 
formism — being a conformist him- 
self — as the leader. 

But the leader who can read 
minds, and who utilizes the betrayal 
cycle through a remorseless police 
control method, can remain leader 
. forever. 

Thus betrayal, consistently ap- 
plied, wins at all levels. 

F or Cemp, a combinafeon event 
was occurring. He felt as if 
someone with whom he was in a 
kind of total telepathic communica- 
tion was small. So small. Or — a 
sudden puzzlement struck him — 
was he, in fact, very large? 



66 



IF 




Incredibly large? (Larger thian the 
universe? The being whose ithougjhits 
Cemp was receiving rejected the con- 
cept of vastness. It was more com- 
fortable to feel — small. 

Satisfied that he w;as a mere 
point, the being considered what he 
might become. He thought, and 
Cemp received the thought along 
with the awareness: N’Yata will be 
pleased that I am having this mo- 
ment of near-ultimate reality. 

At his stage of development, he 
could only expect to hold on for a 
brief time, aligning what was possi- 
ble for him, setting up as many of 
the golden lights as he could, in 
the time available. Mustn’t waste a 
second! 

One by one the being, himself so 
small, discharged even tinier bits of 
the smallness into the dark. Each 
bit was hard to push away, as if 
it’s attachment to him, or con- 
sanguinity, prevented it from de- 
parting to any distance. The first few 
yards were tremendously hard, the 
first miles hard, the first light-years 
progressively easier, the distance of 
a galaxy Hke wafting a feather into 
a whirlwind. And the dark light- 
years beyond seemed almost barrier- 
less. 

Suddenly, one of the points he had 
thus put out attracted the being’s 
attention. He thought: No, oh, no, I 
mustn’t. ’ 

What he fought, then, was a surge 
of interest within ihimself in that 
point. He tried to tell himself the 
truth: that it was he who had put 
out the point, and it was he who 
was projecting the interest into it. 
That it had no interest of its own. 



But a curious inversion wias tak- 
ing place: the conviction that the 
point was of itself interesting. That 
•there was something attractive there, 
separate from 'his thought about it. 

As he had that awareness, Cemp 
sensed that .the creature’s high, pure 
energy began to drop. Rapidly, it 
seem^ — how long it took he didn’t 
know — the being suffered an emo- 
tional transformation from a kind 
of radiance to — an, oh, wdl — 
boredom, through a momentary flash 
of rage to the self-delusion of: I am 
probably god, or at least a sui1>god. 
So everything must align with me. 

He was back, the areature 
thought sardonioaly, to the level of 
betrayal. 

As he had that awareness, he was 
already at the other point, die one 
that had so automatiically annised 
his interest. 

— Every instant that these re- 
markable events occurred, Cemp was 
fighting and observing, by means of 
another aspect of his awareness, a 
life-and-<leath battle that had no 
meaning. 

Because no one was fighting him. 

L ike a man ■who falls througlh an 
luinoticed manh<ole imto a drain- 
age pipe of deep,, dirty, siwiriing 
water; like a child grabbing at and 
abruptly caught by the surging power 
of a live wire; like someone who 
puts his foot into a noose sets off 
a trigger and is jerked a hundred 
feet above ground as a bcsA tree 
springs back into position — Cemp 
had moved himself into a cosmic 
equivalent of the slipstream of a 
rocket. 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



67 




He was msitaiitly beyoiDd Inis abilky 
to cope, sitruigglliBg with a natural 
force that transceiiided has expedi- 
ence. It was a basic conidition of 
space, the existence of which had 
never been suspected by man or Sil- 
kie. 

Cemp put up hiis barriers. Drew 
energy from the trap-^hip. Replenish- 
ed what was being suctioned from 
him. 

The golden dot winked out. 

And Cemp grew aware that he 
was in a large room. Several human 
beings, who were sitting before an 
enodimous instrument bank, turned 
and looked at him in amazement. 

As Cemp recognized top person- 
nel of the Silkie Foundation, Char- 
ley Baxter leaped from his chair 
and came loping across the d'isitances 
of the thick carpet. 

Another realization forced itself 
upon Cemp: His Silkie body felt 
unstiahila in a unique fashion. Not 
un^deasant, the sensation was as If 
some pant of ihim were aware of a 
distant place. 

The allarmed thought came: I’m 
stdl oonnected to another location! 
I could he snatched out of here any 
nsoment. 

And what was alaiimiing about that 
was that he had no further defense. 
Except for one small delaying idea, 
he had used up his available pos- 
sibiliities. 

Accordingly, the real crisis was 
upon him, unless — 

Cemp transformed to human. 

Doing so was not a well consider- 
ed act. He had the thou'ght that a 
change of structure mi^ free him 
even a little from that nemote . • 



connection. Because it was his only 
remaining possibility, he made the 
change at once. 

And, in his haste, he half-fell, 
half-slid, to the floor. 

The transition, he noted with re- 
lief, seemed to work. The feeling of 
being connected faded to a shadowy 
thing — still there, but like a whis- 
per in a room where someone had 
been yelling moments before. 

As Charley Baxter came up, Cemp 
called out to him, “Quick! Let’s 
get to the computer. I don’t know 
what happened. I should be read.” 
On the way, someone slipped 
Cemp a robe. He donned it over his 
naked body without pausing. 

There was a little conversation, 
tense, staccato. Baxter asked, “What 
seemed to happen?” 

“I gained some time,” replied 
Cemp. 

A s he explained it, it was of course 
much more than that. Insitead 
of being instantly defeated, he had 
manipulated and confused the enemy. 
Confronted by a superior 'being, he 
had used what ability and capacity 
he had. Now he desperately needed 
help, some kind of understanding 
about the fantastic thing he had ex- 
perienced. 

Baxter asked anxiously, “How 
much time do you think we have?” 
Cemp replied, “I have an impres- 
sion that they’ie <working at top 
speed. An hour — no more.” 

It appeared to 'be true. At least 
they arrived in the computer room 
safely. 

In its siwift eleotronic way — yet 
slowly for the urgency that Cemp 



68 



IF 




felt — the computer made its study 
of him. 

And came up with its four al- 
ternative answers. 

The first of the two that mattered 
— number three — was strange in- 
deed. “I have the impression,” said 
the computer, ‘‘that everything that 
happened was occurrinig in some- 
one’s mmd. Yet there is an impres- 
sion of something ultimate in that 
concept. Something — well, I don’t 
know — really basic to all things.” 

And of course that was hard to 
accept. Ultimate — basic — was 
too great. 

An ultimate, axiomaticaliy, could 
not be fought or resisted by some- 
thing less. 

“And that,” said the computer, 
“is really all I can teU you. The 
manipulations of space of which the 
Nijjans seem to be capable 'are new. 
It would seem as if the cells in their 
system had to adjust to conditions 
that give them an advantage over 
other life-forms; some kind of great- 
er control over the essence of 
things.” 

It was a bad moment. For even 
as the computer reported failure, 
Cemp sensed an internal change 
for the worse. The something — 
out there — was adjusting to his hu- 
man body. He had a sudden convic- 
tion that at any moment a threshold 
point would be crossed. 

Hastily, he reported the sensation 
to Baxter and finished, “I was hop- 
ing we’d have time for me to visit 
the Earth headquarters of the orig- 
inal Silkies, but I’d better go Silkie 
myself right now.” 

Charley Baxter’s reply showed his 



awareness of Cemi/s danger, the 
possibility that Cemp might find 
himself in some far vacuum of space 
in his unprotected human body. 
Baxter asked anxiously, “Didn’t you 
transform to human because as a 
Silkie you were even more vulner- 
able to whatever is pulling at you?” 
It was true. But ithere was no al- 
ternative. As a Silkie he would tem- 
porarily at least be safer in a dan- 
gerous environment. 

Baxter went on, and his voice 
held a note of strain. “Nat, why 
don’t you change to some other 
form?” 

C emp turned and stared at him. 

And then for a space the two 
of them were silent. They stood 
there 'in that plush room, with its 
cushioned chairs and its small me- 
chanical protrusions — which were 
ah that wias visible of the giant com- 
puter. Finally Cemp said: 

“Charley, the consequences of 
what you suggest are an unknown 
factor.” 

Baxter said earnestly, “Nat, if we 
can’t trust you to work it out, then 
it’s an unsolvable problem anyway.” 
The sensation of imminent change 
was stronger. But still Cemp tem- 
porized. What Baxter suggested was 
almost as world-shaking as the Nij- 
jan threat. 

Transform — to anything!! 

To any body. To any form. Be 
something entirely different from 
the three bodies he knew so well. 

He believed what Charley had 
said wias a truth. But it was a truth 
in relation to a known past — the 
hnnian-Silkie situation that he had 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



69 




grown up with. It was iiot a trutih to 
someone who didn’t Ihave that back- 
ground. The meteorite “originar* Sil- 
kie, Ou-Dan, had made that crystal 
clear. 

Cemp had the strangest conviction 
of his entire life: that he was like a 
man poised in pitch darkness on 
some edge, preparing to jump into 
the night ahead — and bellow. 

It would of course be a limited 
jump. At the moment there were 
only about three alien changes he 
could make. He could become a 
Kibmadine and the creature to 
which the Kibmadine had changed 
to . and a Nijjan. 

He explained to Charley, “You 
have to have a mental picture to 
go by, have to have ‘seen’ the other 
being first; and I only have a few.” 

“Change to Nijjan!” urged Bax- 
ter. 

Cemp said, almost blankly, “Are 
you serious?” 

And then, because he had an in- 
ternal sensation as of something be- 
ginning to slip away from him — 
it was a very distinct impression — 
he hastily played the Nijjan image, 
as he had recorded it — “played” it 
through the transmorpha system. 

As he did so, all his cells received 
the uniform simultaneous charge of 
energy that acted like the explosion 
of the cap of a cartridge, releasing 
the pent-up energy in the cell. 

The .transformation was as rapid 
as it was because the chemical ener- 
gy thus released needed instan- 
taneous unions with their chemioal 
counterparts. 

Again, it was one of those situ- 
atioihs where, by theory, the entire 



process should have required a sec- 
ond or less. In actual fa^ of course, 
living cells were slow to adjust. 

So, it was exactly five and a half 
seconds after start that Cemp was 
in his new state. 

He was also, he observed, in a 
strange place. 

VI 

C emp became aware that he was 
recording the thoughts of the 
other ibeing again. 

This being — the Nijjan enemy 
— grew conscious of something to 
his left. 

He glanced in that direction and 
saw that N’Yata had moved from 
her remote center of being into his 
space. 

It was a movement that he wel- 
comed and admired, since she was 
at least half a stage above him in 
development. Under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, he would have appreci- 
ated her coming because it was both 
flattering to and educational for him. 
And normally it would have been an 
ideal opportunity for him to observe 
and imitate her greater perfection. 

But this was not a normal or or- 
dinary occasion. She had come in 
response to his need for help; his 
puzzling failure to deal with Cemp. 

Her .thought about this showed in 
her movement, and so he perceived 
her as a single golden dot the size of 
an atom. Her smallness, and her lo- 
cation to his left, he was able to 
mark by crisscrossing lines of forces. 

Cemp marked it with him. But 
presently he had a private thought 
to the effect: how am I observing 



70 



IF 




this? And ithieii he reailized. With 
his own eoeirgy^ auitomatLoailly evok- 
ed [firom ihiim by an emotion, widdh 
(the other beanies ithoughits noted 
with a wiy self-judgmenit) was still 
only a few viibiaiti^ alxwe betray- 
al. 

Once again. Logic of Levels and 
all its implicit awareness of the na- 
ture of emotion was Cemp’s only 
possible overt defense. 

And of course, as before, betray- 
al was simply not an area by w!hioh 
he could decisively defeat anyone. 

Also, he felt inituiitively reluctant 
to trigger the more capable N’Yata 
to some ultimate level of win. 

With these various restrictions in 
mind, he directed his one defense 
against all the destruction implicit 
in the betrayal emiotioa. 

Subtly. 

He urged her to a slightly gayer 
meaning of betrayal. Suggested se- 
duction. Argued that the pleasure 
outweighed negative aspects. 

His was a skillful counteraction, 
for the golden dot switched positions 
in space. Moved ifrom his left to 
directly in front of him. 

How many light-years were in- 
volved in that switch, Cemp could 
not deterirdine. N’Yaita was still at a 
very remote viewpoint. The vast dis- 
tances defied measurement by his 
onehalf-step lower techniques, in 
which he reflected the condition of 
the Nijjan 'body he had duplicated. 

“You can still betray!” That was 
the thought-feelinig, which flowed 
back now from the golden dot to 
Cemp. Having sent the message, the 
dot began to recede. Oemp felt a 
distinct drop in his own energy level 



to a stiU lower (than betiayal) level 
of grief and apathy. As tie watched 
the dot go, first lor^g came 
for death, so great was the out^Sow 
of his life energy. 

He recognized it as a half-hearted 
attempt to kill him, sensed that even 
though she knew he was not the 
real G’Tono, she was puzzled. In the 
final issue, she could not bring her- 
self to destroy another Nijjan — not 
even a duplicate one. 

Her withdrawal was an intent to 
consider the problem. He felt her 
let him go. 

His thought ended. He was back 
in the computer room. 

C emp glanced over at Baxter and 
telepathed, “What happened?” 
Having asked the question, Cemp 
grew conscious of three things. The 
first of these was mereily interesting: 
During Cemp’s » • • confrontation 
. with N’Yata, Baxter had moved 
away. 

The man stood now staring at 
Cemp, a wary expression on his 
lean face. 

Once more, Cemp asked, “I bad 
an experience. What seemed to oc- 
cur while I was having it?” It was 
the same question as before, but 
more detailed. 

This time, Baxter stirred. He said 
aloud, “I don’t get your thoughts 
any more. So let me just say that 
now I sense that your Nijjan 
body is radiating more force than I 
can take. Evidently you’ie in a dif- 
ferent energy state.” 

Cemp was reniembering his own 
earlier problem in receiving the com- 
munication of the Nijjan. After a 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



71 




moment’s consideiraitioiii of tihe dif- 
fiouSity, he tentatively tried for an 
adjustment of output in the bank 
of ceis devoted ito the problem. 
Then he telepathed to Baxter, again 
tentatively. 

An expression of relief came over 
the lean man’s face.^ “Okay,” he re- 
plied, “We’re on. What happened?” 
Cemp hastily reported his experi- 
ence, ftnishing, “There’s no ques- 
tion, my original use of Logic of 
Levels confused the first Nijjan I 
met, whose name I gather is G’Tono. 
By spiraling him up to a super- 
win situation, I escaped whatever 
he had in mind. And now, by be- 
coming a duplicate of him — essen- 
tially that’s all I did — I momen- 
tarily confused N’Yata. But she re- 
covered fast, and so time is of the 
essence.” 

“You think — ” 

“Wait!” admonished Cemp. 

It was the second awareness that 
was suddenly in Cemp’s mind, and 
that was not merely interesting; it 
was urgent: 

He still had the consciousness of 
being a Nijjan. 

I t had all happened so fast At the 
moment of change, instant trans- 
fer to a confrontation with N’Yata; 
then back here — 

Now, Cemp realized that as a 
Nijjan he could hear sounds. Baxter’s 
human voice had j>enetrated to him 
at a normal level — sea-level Earth 
pressure, it seemed. 

With that to start, Cemp did a 
lightning-swift orientation: not only 
sound was affected but sight, 
f^ng, proprioceptive sensations. He 



'possessed an apparently human phy- 
sic-emoition sp^trum. 

And he could walk. He felt odd- 
shaped appendages that held him, 
balanced him, enabled him to stand 
. and arm-like things, more si- 
nuous. 

Cemp was not surprised that he 
was aware of human quaHties. 
Change of shape was not change 
of being, but a cbamdeon-like al- 
teration of appearance, a total al- 
teration as distinct from merely a 
method of conceialment, not simply 
a 'blending with a background. 

He was the human-Silkie, Nat 
Cemp, in the shape of a Nijjan. His 
Barth-horn cells were the basic stuff 
of his new body, different undoubt- 
edly from the actual cells of a Nij- 
jan. 

Yet the similarity, in its finer de- 
tails, was sufficiently intricate to be 
interesting to Cemp. It made him 
hopeful that, by being a Nijjan- 
shape, he would be able also to 
discover some of the secrets of that 
shape’s abilities. 

His attention continued to leap 
from point to point of his Nijjan 
body. 

The legs and arms — being able 
to have them in the vacuum of space: 
that was different from Silkie^hu- 
man. 

The Silkie shape could survive in 
space only if the interior flesh and 
structure were separated from the 
vacuum by a steel4iard ohitinous 
substance. For that, even legs had 
to be massive. And so Silkies had 
semi4egs and nothing but a . grimace 
where the face and head should be. 

The Nijjans evidently had the 



72 



IF 




same ability without change of form. 
A hard substance? It didn’t seem 
that way. It seemed more like a 
different molecular structure. 

— No time to investigate that! 

On a higher level, there was in the 
Nijjan body the entire magnetic 
wave band, and radiation sensitivity; 
also, awareness of gravity, and all 
the stasis centers that made it pos- 
sible for Silkies to operate stabily 
in the vacuum of space. 

There was more. 

Cemp perceived another set of 
control centers high in the thickest 
part of the pyramidal shape. But 
these neural areas were silent, 
flowed no energy and responded to 
none of his hastily directed thought- 
commands. 

If there was any automatic ac- 
tivity above the level of mere chemi- 
cal survival in that mass of nerve 
substance, Cemp could not detect 
it. 

He surmised uneasily: was it the 
space-control lobe of the Nijjan 
brain? 

But he had no time to experiment 
with it. Not yet. 

What was particularly frustrating 
was that there was no larger pyra- 
midal energy image projecting from 
him. So that was not an automatic 
process. Could it be an output of 
some kind from the space-control 
cells? 

No time to investigate that either. 

No time, because his third aware- 
ness was forcing in upon his atten- 
tion, and that was something he 
could do something about. 

By his reasoning, furthermore, it 
was related to the second awareness 



he bad had. Thus he was not really 
turning away from what it was like 
to be a Nijjan to something less ur- 
gent. Not completely turning, any- 
way. 

“Wait ... a little longer,” Cemp 
repeated to Baxter. 

Having telepathed the second ad- 
monition, Cemp put out another 
thought on a magnetic beam that 
humans could read. 

The thought was directed toward 
the headquarters on Earth of the 
Space Silkies. It was on an open 
channel; and so he was not surprised 
when he received answers from three 
minds, one a Silkie female. 

All three answers were the same: 
We space Silkies have agreed that 
we will not discuss our affairs on an 
individual basis. 

“What I have to say is very ur- 
gent. Do you have a spokesman?” 
Cemp asked. 

“Yes. I-Yun. But you’ll have to 
come over. He can only talk if some 
of us are monitoring.” 

T he implication was of group 
thinking and group action, de- 
cisions by many, not merely one. 
Considering the restrictions — which 
he did fleetingly — Cemp had a 
sudden intuition, a -thougiht that was 
surdy an insight of major import 
“I’ll be there in — ” Cemp be- 
gan. 

He paused, turned to Baxter and 
asked, “How quickly can you get 
me over to Space Silkie hc^quar- 
ters?” 

Baxter was pale. “It would take 
too long, Nat,” he protested. ‘Tif- 
teen, twenty minutes — ” 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



73 




“ — in twenty minutes; so get 
everybody togeti^ in one room!” 
Cemp completed his thought to the 
Silkies in their distant headquarters. 

Whereupon, he mentally persuad- 
ed Baxter, still objecting, literally 
to run to the nearest elevator. People 
turned and stared as the silvery Nij- 
jan body and the human being ran 
along side by side. But Cemp was 
already explaining, already con- 
vincing the other. 

As a result, what authority could 
do, was done. 

A “down” elevator stopped on an 
emergency signal, picked them up 
and whisked them to the roof. A 
helijet, about to take off, was held 
back by a pre-emptive control tower 
command, and presently it was 
zooming across the rooftops of the 
huge buildings that made up the 
Silkie Foundation, soaring many de- 
grees indeed away from its original 
destination. 

It zeroed in presently on the land- 
ing depot of the three-story build- 
ing which had been assigned as a 
preliminary headquarters and which 
was more or less across town from 
the Tnaln Silkie community. 

During the flight, Cemp resumed 
has magnetic level communication. 
He told the receiving trio who the 
enemy was and explained, “Since 
I had no reaction to it in my Silkie 
form, I’m assuming that those of us 
bom on Earth do not have any old 
reflexes on the subject of Nijjans. 
But it seemed to me that the meteor- 
ite Silkies might.” 

There was a long pause, and then 
another mind sent a thought on the 
mapietic beam. “This is I-Yun. All 



restrictions are temporarily off. 
Answer with any truth you have, 
anyone.” 

The female Silkie’s thought came 
first. “But it’s so many generations 
ago!” she protested. “You believe 
we’ll have an ancestral memory 
after such a long time?” 

Cemp replied, “If that’s what it 
takes, I can only say I hope so, 
but — ” 

He hesitated. What was in his 
mind w-as even more fantastic. He 
had got the impression from the Glis 
that a number of really original 
Silkies were still around. 

His brief hesitation ended. He 
sent the thought. 

“You mean, like a hundred 
thousand years old?” came an as- 
tonished male Silkie response. 

“Maybe not that long,” said 
Cemp. “In fact, I compute from 
feeling-thoughts I recorded that it’s 
not more than ten thousand years 
since the Glis attached the Silkies 
to him. But anywhere from five to 
ten thousand, yes.” 

T here was a pause. Then the 
thought came: “What do you 
expect such a Silkie to do? Defeat 
a Nijjan? Remember, our under- 
standing is that we Silkies were the 
ones who were defeated and deci- 
mated. And, besides, how will we 
find the old ones? No one remembers 
anything like that far back; the 
Glis with its memory-erasing techni- 
ques saw to that. Do you have a 
method of stimulating such ancient 
reflexes?” 

Cemp, wiho indeed had the per- 
fect, practicable method, wanted to 



74 



IF 




know how many Silkies were in the 
building this very moment 

“Oh, about a hundred.” That was 
I-Yun. 

It seemed a sizable cross-seotion. 

Cemp wanted to know if they 
were all together as he had request- 
ed. 

“No, but we’ll get them here if 
you wish.” 

Cemp very much wished. “And 
quick!” he urged. “I swear to you 
that there’s no time to waste.” 

Presently, Cemp sent another 
magnetic level message, “Mr. Bax- 
ter and I are now landing on the 
roof. We shall be down lin the big 
room in about one minute.” 

During that minute he sent 
streams of thoughts down to the 
group, explaining his analysis. 

The decisive question was: Since 
the Silkies had indeed been deci- 
mated in the long ago by the Nij- 
jans, how come a few had sur- 
vived? 

Why had not all Silkies been ex- 
terminated? 

What survival method had kept a 
few alive? 

Since the survivors, or their des- 
cendants, were the only Silkie avail- 
able, the answer must be buried deep 
in their unconscious minds, or else 
be available by stimulation of an- 
cestral DNA-RNA molecules. 

Cemp and Baxter emerged from 
their elevator and started along a 
corridor toward a large green door. 

At this penultimate moment, I- 
Yun’s thought showed a qualm. 

“Mr. Cemp,” he telepathed un- 
easily, “we have cooperated with 
you more than we intended to co- 



operate with anyone on Earth. But I 
tMnk we should know before we go 
any further what to expect next” 
. At that point, Baxter opened the 
green door for Cemp, and Cemp 
walked into the big room. 

Cemp was aware of Baxter return- 
ing along the corridor, running at 
top speed — his retreat was actually 
protected by an energy screen that 
Cemp put up at the moment he went 
through the door. But the agreement 
was that Baxter would get out of the 
way, so that Cemp would not have 
to devote attention to his defense. 

The reason Baxter had come this 
far was that he wanted to see the 
room where the space Silkies were 
waiting. With that much pre-visuali- 
zation, he could get the rest by way 
of the telepathic channel Cemp left 
open for him. 

In an emergency his experience 
might be useful; that was the 
thought .... 

VII 

A t that instant of entry the scene 
that spread before Cemp was 
of many men and women, sitting or 
standing. His Nijjan body had visual 
awareness to either side, and so he 
also noticed that four Silkie shapes 
“floated” near the ceiling on both 
sides of the door. Guards? He pre- 
sumed so. 

Cemp accepted their presence as 
a normal precaution. His own quick 
defense against them was to put up 
a magnetic signal system which, 
when triggered by any dangerous 
force, would automatically set up a 
screen. 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



75 




The majority of the occupants 
of the big room were not a pre- 
possessing lot, for the human shape 
was not easy for these space Sil- 
kies. But human-like they were. And, 
as Cemp entered, they naturally 
focused their gazes on him. 

Every pair of eyes at the exact 
same moment saw ^e silvery glitter- 
ing body of a Nijjan. 

How many individuals were pres- 
ent Cemp did not know or count, 
then or later. 

But there was an audible tearing 
sound as all over the room clothes 
ripped, threads parted and cloth 
literally shredded. 

The sound was the result of a 
simultaneous transformation by the 
majority from human to Silkie. 
About a dozen people, eight of them 
women, merely gasped and made no 
effort to change. 

Three individuals turned into Nij- 
jans. 7 

H aving become so, they instantly 
scattered. They ran off in three 
directions and came to a halt each 
in a separate comer; they did not 
actually leave the room. 

Cemp waited, tense, all receptors 
recording; not knowing what more 
to expect. This was what he had 
hoped for; and here, in all its po- 
tentiality, it was. Three. Almost in- 
credibly, three out of a hundred or 
so had respKDnded with — what? He 
wanted very much to believe that 
theirs was an age-old reflex that 
operated in the presence of Nijjans. 

Could it be that the defense 
against a Nijjan was — to become a 
Nijjan? 



It seemed almost* too elementary. 
Raised numerous questions. 

Cemp received a thought from 
Baxter: “Nat, do you i think the old 
Silkies of long ago might have been 
killed one by one because they were 
surprised and couldn’t turn Nijjan 
quickly enough?” 

It seemed reasonable. The lag, al- 
ways that lag in the transmorpha 
system, had been a dangerous few 
moments for Silkies. 

But the question remained: After 
turning into Nijjans, what did they 
know? And what could they do 
against real Nijjans? 

Out of the darkness of unknown 
numbers of miJlenia, from some- 
where below the mist of forgetfulness, 
created by the Glis in its effort at 
total control, had now come a re- 
sponse. Like a pure light carrying 
images as from a projector, it shone 
from that far distant time into the 
here and now. 

Was there more to those images 
than appeared on the surface? More 
than the transformation itself? 

The swift seconds ran their 
courses, and Cemp got nothing more, 
nothing special. 

Baxter’s anxious mind must have 
registered Cemp’s developing disap- 
pointment, for his thought came, 
“Isn’t there some association they’ve 
got with the changeover? Some rea- 
son for why the transformation was 
successful?” 

Cemp took that thought, made 
it his own, transferred it to a mag- 
netic wave and sent it on to the 
three Silkie-Nijjans. 

With that, he got his first non- 
automatic response. Said one, “You 



76 



IF 




want my moment by moment reac- 
tions? Well, the reflex that was trig- 
gered had only on oniinary trans- 
morplha lag. 1 estimate no more than 
seven Earth seconds was what the 
changeover required. While waiting 
for the change, and immediately 
after, my impulse was to escape. 
But of course I only ran a few 
yards and then recognized that you 
were not a true Nijjan. At which 
moment of awareness I stopped my 
flight There followed intense anxie- 
ty — memories, obviously, since I 
had no reason to feel any of that 
here. But that’s it.” 

Cemp asked quickly, “You had 
no impulse to use any attack or de- 
fense energies?” 

“No. It was just change and get 
out of there.” 

One of the remaining two Nij- 
jan-Silkies was able to add only a 
single new thought. “I had the 
conviction,” he said, “that one of 
us was doomed. And I felt sad and 
wondered who it would be this time.” 

“But there was nothing,” Cemp 
persisted, “about how one of you 
would be killed? And I presume no 
awareness of the means by which 
the Nijjan had suddenly appeared 
in your midst without advance warn- 
ing?” 

“Nothing at ail,” answered the 
three in unison. 

Baxfter”s third diought intruded, 
“Nat, we’d better get back to the 
computer.” 

En route, Baxter made another, 
more far reaching decision. 

From him, preceded by a pri- 
vate emergency code — known for 
its extreme meaning only to its reci- 



pients — there was mentally pro- 
jected by way of a general alarm 
system in the Silkie Foundation, a 
warning message to “all Silkies on 
Earth and all Special People — ” 
Slightly more than six thousand 
persons received it. 

In the warning Baxter described 
the Nijjan danger and the only solu- 
tion so far analyzed for Silkies: 
change to Nijjan and scatter! 

Having completed his own mes- 
sage, Baxter introduced Cemp who 
broadcast, for Silkies only, the Nij- 
jan image. 

S hortly after, Baxter and Cemp 
completed their trip to the com- 
puter, which said, “Though this neiw 
data gives no additional clue to the 
space control methods of the Nijjans, 
we can now view the nature of the 
battle by which the old Silkie na- 
tion was gradually decdmated. The 
method was a cautious, neverialtered 
system of one^jy-one exterminatioia.” 
The computer thought it initer- 
esting that even the higher type Nij- 
jan (female^ N’Yata, had not mlade 
a serious attempt to kill Cemp white 
he was in his Nijjan form. 

Listening to the analysis, Cemp 
was plunged into gloom. It was dear 
now that, first, the Glis molecule, 
and then his small use of Logic of 
Levels on betrayal had saved him 
in his first two encounters. 

He thought bknMy: What could 
be the nature of space that man or 
Silkie had never even dreamed of it? 

Nothing to something to nothing 
— ^ and that sligjhtly caved-in, ool- 
iapsed body of Lan Jedd. Those 
were the only dues. 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



77 




“Space,” said the computer in 
answer to Cemp’s question, “is con- 
sidered to be an orderly, neutral 
Viasitness, wherein energy and matter 
masses may interact according to a 
laiTge but finite number of rules. The 
distances of space are so enormous 
that life has (had an opportunity to 
evolve at leisure in innumerable 
chance ways on a large but finite 
number of planets on which, acci- 
dentally — it is presumed — suit- 
able conditions developed.” 

The definition deepened Cemp’s 
gloom. It seemed like truth. Yet, if 
it were Hterally so, then how could 
the Nijjan have spanned those enor- 
mous distances apparently in no time 
at all? One or more of the assump- 
tions needed to be modified. Or so 
it seemed. 

C emp said unhappily, “We’ve got 
to remember we’re looking at 
an evolved universe. Perhaps, in its 
younger days, space was less — what 
did you say? — neutral. The specu- 
lative question arises, what might an 
unordorly space have been like?” 
“This is something that can be 
learned, now that Logic of Levels is 
applicable.” 

“Eh!” That was Baxter, astounded. 
“Logic of Levels will work here? 
How?” 

“Consider!” said the computer. 
“A command to operate the space- 
control areas will have to come from 
the central self of a Nijjan. Our prob- 
lem is that we don’t know what that 
command is. But some kind of 
thought stimulates it. Once stimu- 
lated a basic action response occurs. 
Naturally, somebody will have to 



force a dangerous confrontation in 
order to trigger such a cycle.” 

Cemp said quickly, “Do you still 
have the feeling that what we might 
trigger is bigger than what happened 
to the Glis? And more basic?” 

“Definitely.” 

“But — baffled — “what could 
be bigger than an apparently small 
object — like the Glis — expanding 
into the largest sun in the known 
universe?” 

“This is something you wiU dis- 
cover. I presume you are the one 
who will discover it.” 

Cemp, who (hadn’t thought about 
it, presumed instantly that he would 
indeed be the one. 

Thinking thus, feeling the irony 
but resigned nonetheless, Cemp 
transifarmed to his Sdikiiie body. He 
expected that he would immediately 
perceive the distant tug on all his 
cells. 

But there was nothing. No aware- 
ness in him of a faraway segment 
of space. He had not the f aintest 
sense of being unbalanced at some 
deep level. His entire body was at 
peace and in a state of eqmlibrium 
with his surroundinigs. 

Cemp reported the situation to 
Baxter — and then warily transform- 
ed to human. 

But there was no distant pull on 
him in that state either. 

A few minutes later the computer 
expressed what was already obvious, 
“They’re taking no chances. They 
never did with Silkies. You’ll have 
to seek them out ... or else he ex- 
terminated one by one, now that 
they have found you.” 

From the comer of Ibis eye, Cemp 



78 



IF 




noticed Baxter as that analysis came 
through. The man’s face had a 
strange look: sort of hypnotic, sort 
of iniward^urning .... 

Cemp was quick. He grabbed the 
man and yelled, “What’s the 
thought? What command is being 
given?” 

Baxter twisted weakly in that iron 
grip, abruptly stopped his resisting 
and whispered, “The message I’m 
getting is absolutely ridiculous. I 
refuse!” 

VIII 

T he doorbell rang with a soft, 
musical note. Joanne Cemp 
stopped what she was doing in the 
kitchen and thought: The time has 
come for revelation. The night of 
no-memory is over. 

Having had the thought, casually, 
as if it were an ordinary concept, 
she headed for the door. And it was 
then that she simultaneously realized 
two things. The shock of each of the 
two brought a reaction of an in- 
tensity that she ihad not previously 
experienced in her entire life. 

The first realization was: Night 
of no-memory! . Revelation! 

. Why, that’s crazy! Where would 
I get an idea like that? 

The second realization was that 
she was getting no thoughts from 
whoever had rung the doorbell. 

She felt a chih. She, who could 
read minds better even than her Sd- 
kie husband by the direct telepathic 
method, she was receiving no 
thoughts. It had always been a point 
of wonder that the Special People 
were so great in this area of mind 



reading: something about a uiniquo 
DNA-RNA combination in the cells 
of a few human beings, that was not 
duplicated in other humans or in 
Silkies. 

But even that uncanny ability 
sensed no presence at the door. 
Nothing. Not a sound. Not a thought. 
Not a sign of another mind or being. 

Joanne veered down the hall and 
into her bedroom and secured her 
gun. That was pretty weak stuff 
against what she now suddenly sus- 
pected might be a space Silkie 
woman making a second visitation. 
But the first Silkie woman had not 
been mentally silent. 

Still, against a human the gun 
would be effective, particularly as 
she had no intention of opening the 
door. A moment later, Joanne turned 
on the closed-circuit TV and found 
herself gazing at — nothing. 

S he had the thought: The bell was 
rung from a distance, from many 
light-years away, to tell you that 
someone will come. You have done 
your duty. The painful laiboratory 
change from Nijjan to human will 
now be reversed .... Unfiortiunate 
that Nijj,ans have had no natural 
way of transforming from one shape 
to another. However, by changing 
shape in this difficult way you were 
enabled to marry on Earth Sdhde. By 
so doing you have lulled him and 
understood him; and now that the 
space Silkies have finally revealed 
themselves, we can finally decide 
what to do with this dangerous race. 

And what you and tthe other Spe- 
cial People have done will determine 
the fate of the universe endangerers. 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



79 




Joanne frowned at the message — 
for that was how she thought of it 
— ibuit she made no answer. She 
simply stood there, silent and dis- 
turbed. What kind of nonsensel # 

The thought went on: You are 
skeptical, no doubt, but it will soon 
be proved. You may now ask any 
questions you wish. 

After many heartbeats, during 
which Joanne considered, remem- 
bered, decided, she still refused to 
reply. 

She saw the message as a trap, a 
lie, an attempt to locate her if she 
replied. Actually, even if it were 
true, it didn’t matter. Her involve- 
ment on Barth was total. She thought 
to herself: This is the final Silkie- 
Nijjan confrontation, and it’s all a 
bunch of Nijjan madness. 

She didn’t have to accept such a 
solution, no matter if her own back- 
ground were Nijjan. 

During all these intense moments, 
Joanne had kept her own thoughts 
out of the itelepathic band. Yet the 
fear was already in her, the realiza- 
tion that this message, or a variation 
of it, was probably being received 
by all forty-seven'^hundred-odd of 
the Special People on Earth. And 
the fear which almost petrified her 
was that among these numerous per- 
sons somebody would be foolish, 
somebody would answer. 

The awful conviction came that 
any reply would mean disaster for 
everybody. Because all of the Special 
People without exception knew so 
much that was ibasic about Silkies. 

Even as she had the anxiety, 
somebody did answer. Two women 
and three men almost shnultaneous- 

80 



ly projected their outraged replies. 
Joanne received every nuance of the 
emotion that accompanied each un- 
wise reply: 

Said one: “But many of the Spe- 
cial People have died in the past 
two hundred years — ” 

A second chimed in, “So they 
can’t be immortal Nijjans.” 

A third mind said, “If what you 
say is true, it proves that Siloes 
and Nijjans could live together.’’ 
The fourth person — a man — 
was scornful: “This time you crazy 
killers have run up against more 
than you bargained for.’* 

And the fifth telepathic human 
reply to the Nijjan trap was, “I don’t 
know what you expect to gain from 
this lie, but I reject it.” 

T hat was as far as the doomed 
five got with their response. 
The best later reconstruction of 
what happened then was that in each 
instance, answering located the in- 
dividual to the remote watching 
minds of the Nijjans. At once a Nij- 
pan arrived on the scene — in the 
house, on the street, wherever — 
and seized the person. 

At the moment of seizure a sin- 
gle mental scream of despairing re- 
alization came from one of the 
women. The remaining four went 
silently to their fates. 

What had happened: shortly after 
the Space Silkie, Ou-Dan, left Cemp 
in the ship near the dead body of 
Lan Jedd — he saw a rapid move- 
ment beside him. 

That was all Ou-Dan had time to 
observe. The next split-instant he 
was subjected to an internal pressure 



IF 




against wMch li€ hiad no defense. It 
could have been his moment <of 
death, for he wias completely sur- 
prised and helpless. But the Nijjan, 
G’Tono, have already had his dou- 
ble faihire with Nat Cemp, wanted a 
prisoner and not a dead body. Not 
yet. 

Moments later, he had the un- 
conscdous Ou-Dan on hiis own planet. 

The resultant study of the inter- 
nal working of a Silkie was some- 
what disappointing to the various 
Nijjans who came from disfbant place 
to look him over: there was nothing 
in Ou-Dan’s memories that explain- 
ed how Cemp had escaped destruc- 
tion in his confronitaition with 
G’Tono. 

His captors quickly discovered the 
differences between the space and 
Earth Silkies and leaimed from Ou- 
Dan that Cemp was an Earth Sil- 
kie. The Nijjans thereupon reasoned 
accurately that the Space SUdes, be- 
ing considered unreliable, had sim- 
ply never been given the secret of 
the special technique that Cemp had 
used. 

In .their study of Ou-Dan, the 
great beings were delayed for many 
minutes, perhaps even an entire 
•hour^ by an attitude that radiated 
from him. Ou-Dan so thoroughly dis- 
missed and downrated the human- 
SiHcie relaitionship that his emotion 
about it was a barrier. Thus, for a 
decisive itime, the Nijjans did not 
note in his mind ithat the Special 
People were a unique human group. 

During that vital period, Baxter 
extended the information about the 
Nijjans to the Special People, Cemp 
and he met with the Space Silkies 



and talked to the computeir. And 
so, when the five Special People 
were captured, Earth was as ready 
as Earth would ever be. 

The Nijjans secured the basic clue 
from .all five of their human prison- 
ers. Moments later, the knowledge 
of Logic of Levels was going down 
the Nijjan line of planets, muM- 
millions of them. 

IX 

O n G’Tono’s planet was a tall 
mountain that rose thousands 
of feet sheer from the 'ground. On 
top of ithat mountain stood the palace 
of G’Tono. 

Inside the throne room, the octo- 
pus-people hurried and bustled and 
shuffled in a steady stream of activi- 
ty, partly ritual and partly m re- 
lation to the five human prisoners 
and to the Space SiDde, Ou-Dan. 

The quintet of Special People were 
beginning to fed a little easier; were 
no longer so certain tihat they would 
be murdered out of hand. Ou-Dan, 
who had been internally damaiged 
as a result of his interrogation, lay 
unconscious in one comer, ignored 
by all except a few guards. 

Across the room from the hu- 
mans — a distance of more than 
a hundred yards — was a great, 
Ottering throne chair. On the chair 
sat a figure even more glittery in 
his natural state than any of the 
inanimate objects that fram«l him — 
. G’Tono himself! 

About a dozen of the octopus- 
people lay face down on the marble 
in front of their tyrant. Their gentle 
buibuous faces pressed against the 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES

hard floor. It was a priceless privilege 
for itinose who were ithere, and every 
half hxmr the dozen or so person- 
ages rduotantly gave up their places 
to another group of the same size, 
all of whom were equally apprecia- 
tive. 

G’Tono paid no attention to these, 
his servant-people. He was engaged 
in a mental oonversation with 
N’Yata, 2400 light-years away, and 
the subject of their concern was in 
fact ithe fate of the prisoners. 

G’Tono believed that the five 
Special People and Ou-Dan had 
served their purpose land should be 
put to death on the betray principle. 
N’Yata felt that no Anal decision 
should be made about prisoners until 
the Earth-Silkie situation was entire- 
ly resolved, which could only happen 
if all the Silkies were destroyed. 

She pointed out that the betray 
idea did not apply except where it 
was part of a control system. No 
control existed as yet to human 
beings and would not until a Nijjan 
took over Barth 'as his domain. 

G ’Tono was beginning to fed very 
boldly masouHne in relation to 
N’Yata. And so he took the attitude 
that her answer showed a loveable 
feminine weakness, a caution un- 
necessary now that the human-Silkie 
problem was solved. For all Nijjan 
purposes, the proourement of the 
Logic of Leyels concept ended the 
danger. 

“You seem to believe that some- 
thing can still go wrong,” he pro- 
tested. 

“Let’s wait,” said N’Yata. 

G’Tono replied scathingly that Nij-

He thereupon listed for N’Yata answered. “About a hundred.” 
the reasons why the SilMes were The smallness of the number mo- 
defeated for all practiical purposes: mentarily gave pause to GTono. He 

Nijjan attacks — said GTono — had a natural cynicism about things 
would in future be made in such a Nijjan; yet his rationali2^oa seemed 
way that no Silkie could ever again true to him .... It was true that 
hitch a ride as the Silkie, Cemp, Nijjans had a hard time getting along 
had so skillfully done. Furthermore, with one another. So many proud 
the vast majority of Nijjans, though individuals, each with his planet — 
aiUowing through their mind^barriers of which he, or she, was absolute 
the information about Logic of ruler. Where everyone, without ex- 
Levels, had fortunately refused to ception, was a king or a queen, egos 
be involved in the actual struggle, had a tendency to soar out of sight. 

GTono explained, “Contrary to Once in a while, of course, a queen 
our initial irritation with their re- would accept a oommunication from 
fusal to participate, what they have a king, as N’Yata had done with 
done — or rather, not done — is him. And at certain times kings were 




ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 83 



receptive to a oamimtmcaitLoa from 
a queen. G’Tono liad observed witii 
jealousy that ithe biimdred-odd who 
had responded to N’Yaita’s oaM for 
volunteers were all males .... 

B ut that very aloofness of the 
great majority was now, G’Tono 
argued, a sign of the indestructibili- 
ty of the Nijjan race. Scattered all 
over the universe, out of contact 
with their own kind, individuai Nij- 
jans an their total numbers couldn’t 
be hunited down in a million years, 
even assuming that somebody ex- 
isted with -the atodiity and power to 
kill Nijjan-s; but there was no such 
person, group or race. 

“And now that we have the only 
dangerous Silkie weapon, Logic of 
Levels, our position is albsolutely im- 
pregnable,” G’Tono pointed out. 

N’Yata replied that she was still 
studying Log^ of Levels and that 
it wasn’t the mistakes Nijjans might 
make in the future that worried her; 
indeed, she conceded that the chance 
of additional errors was unlikely. 
The question was, could GTono 
and she recover from the errors that 
had already been made? 

G’Tono was astohkhed. “The only 
mistake that would matter,” he ol> 
jected, “wouM be if we had left 
this Silkier Cemp, some nieans of 
forcing me or you to 'transport him 
here by our space control system. 
Though I,” he oontinued scornfuliy, 
“would certainly like to be the first 
to know of such a method, I find 
myself wondering, would he dare to 
oomie? Because whiat could he do in 
a direct con&ontation with me, who 
is more po^yerful than any Sillde?” 



He had been i thinkikig hard while 
he was speaking, and now he saw 
an opening in her logic and a way 
of -gaininig his own point, made ear- 
lier. 

“As I see it,” he said, “the one 
way in which we might be vulnerable 
is through these prisoners. So I think 
you wiM -agree that instant extermina- 
tion is a safety precaution, if nothing 
more. Don’t -try to interfere!” 

He did not wait for N’Yata’s re- 
ply, but sent a high-level energy blast 
at the two women and ithree men, 
and at the hdpess Ou-Dan. All six 
prisoners were literally dissolved in- 
to their component elements; death 
was as rapid as that. 

Having taken the action, G’Tono 
proceeded with his hsting of favor- 
able points. “After all,” he said, 
“lacking space controil, Silkies are 
trapped on or near Earth or at besit 
are subject to the slow speeds of 
ordinary space travel. I estimate that 
in three Earth weeks I could perhaps 
expect to have an Earth ship arrive 
at my planet. Whereupon, if you 
were to invite me, I could visit you 
for a whale. And, frankly, what could 
they do? Where could -they look? A 
Nijjan can disappear into a distance 
in a splitrinstant.” 

He stopped, feeling suddenly diz- 
zy. 

N’Yata telepathed sharply, “What’s 
happening?” 

“I — ” faltered G’Tono. 

That was as far as he got. The 
dizziness had become an all-envelop- 
ing madness, and he fell from this 
throne chair to the marble floor. 
Fell hard, rolled over onto his back 
an# lay there like one dead.

T he Nijjans had lied. That was 
what snatched Oemp’s most in- 
tense interest. 

A quick check of records by the 
computer had established, with 
thousands of detailed documenta- 
tions, that the Special People could 
not possibly have been Nijjans. And 
so it was a lie. 

Hard to believe that the Nijjans 
could have exposed one of their 
mrniber to a counter-attack on that 
level. But it looked as if they had. 

Cemp shared his analysis with 
Charley Baxter and watched Bax- 
ter become excited. The thin man 
said, “You’re right, Nat! A lie is a 
complete disaster in a world where 
people understand the energy flows 
involved.” 

And could control them as Silkies 
could. 

Because an existing object is truth 
incarnate. There it is — whatever 
it is — unparadoxical, without an 
opposite. 

It cannot not-^be. Or at least it 
cannot not-have-*been; if it was mat- 
ter and has been converted to ener- 
gy, or vice versa, it still exists in 
some aspect of its ever-form. 

A lie about such an object is a 
mental attempt to alter the “is” 
of it. Basdally, the effort implicit 
in the lie is to create a dichotomy 
where none can exist. There is no op- 
posite, yet the lie says there is. 

Hence, the moment a dichotomy 
is evoked in somebody’s mind, there 
is a confusion created. 

It was too potentially great a pos- 
sibility to miss. 



In telling his plan to Baxter, 
Cemp pointed out, “You’ll have to 
send a ship after me, because I’ll be 
stranded there!” 

“You don’t think the method of 
getting you to Nijja will also get 
you away?” Baxter asked, doubtful- 

ly- 

“No. Somebody will ibe riding 
herd on all this, and they’ll notice.” 
“It’ll take three weeks for a ship 
to get there,” Baxter objected. 

Cemp couldn’t take the time to 
consider that. The pace of this battle 
was super-speed. Since (the struggle 
had begun out there between G’Tono 
and himself, the enemy had taken 
time only to make bri^ studies of 
new data before striking again. 

“After all,” said Cemp, “I can’t 
be sure how successful I’ll be. I ex- 
pect (to get whoever told the lie, but 
that won’t solve the problem. And 
I’ll set it up so that whoever helps 
him is doomed also. But a chain re- 
action like 'that can only go so far 
before somebody gets wise.” 

Baxter spoke again, urgently, 
“Now that these beings have Logic 
of Levels, they’ll be able to trigger 
it in you even as you’re triggering 
it in them. Have you thought of 
that?” 

S ince there was no defense against 
Logic of Levels, Cemp hadn’t 
even considered it. There being no 
point in thinking about it, now that 
it had been called to his attention 
. he didn’t. 

He converted to Nijjain and pio- 
jected the thought: “I want you to 
recall the moment when the message 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



85 




arrived telling you <the lie that you 
were a Nijjan.” 

Between such expexits as Baxter 
and himself, it required less tham a 
minute to make a study of the wave 
patterns and to measure the subtle 
variations of the Nijjan version of 
the telepathic band of the Special 
People — and to superimpose on 
that exact band and ithat individual 
variation all two hundred and 
seventy-eight dichotomies, known to 
be the most confusing of the verbal 
opposites that had mentally tangled 
human beings since the beginning of 
language: 

. Right-wrong . good-bad 
. justice-injustice 

A living brain receiving for the 
first time such a madness in ithe time 
of a few seconds could go into a 
state of itotal confusion. 

At key points along that train of 
words, Cemp placed large, hypnotic- 
type command loads designed to in- 
fluence the receiving Nijjan brain 
during the confusion to — 

First, utilize Cemp’s own pre- 
vious experience to transport hiTn 
through space. 

And, second, set up a basic Logic 
of Levels in the receiving Nijjan 
brain. 

Oemp arrived — it was part of 
his hypnotic command to GTono — 
outsit the atmosphere of G’Tono’s 
planet. As he descended toward the 
surface, he saw that there was a 
great city below and a huge ocean 
beside it. 

He landed on an isolated beach 
of that ocean where the thunder of 
the surf and the soaxeill of sea briefly 
enticed him. Ignoring that sudden 



desire for the feel of water, he walk- 
ed toward the city. Arrived at the 
outskirts, he boldly entered the first 
of the odd-shaped dwellings he came 
to; odd in that the doorways were 
low and broad, and, inside he had to 
stoop 'because the ceilings were less 
than' six feet. There were three 
chunky octopus-like aliens inside. 
But he saw them; they never saw 
him. Cemp manipulated the hallu- 
cinatory mechanisms of the three, 
whereupon they observed him as one 
of themselves. After studying their 
minds, Cemp carefully went to a 
nearby street, climbed up to a roof, 
and watched the octopus-beings who 
went by. 

As Cemp had already correctly 
analyzed, these aliens were not 
dangerous to him, and they were 
very definitely not up to defending 
themselves. After reading the minds 
of several hundreds, Cemp did not 
detect a single suspicious thought. 
The fundamental goodness of the 
beings he did observe decided him 
on his next move. 

Minutes later, he walked in on 
several leading members of the 
government, hallucinated them into 
seeing him as a human being and 
thou^t at them, “Where is the one 
who can betray?” 

The tense creatures had drawn 
aiway from him. They did not under- 
stand (the signifioanoe of his ques- 
tion, for they said that on Nijja no 
one ever betrayed anyone. 

T he answer amused Cemp in a 
steely-grim fashion. It meant, 
as he had suspected, that there was 
only one betray cycle in action on 



86 



IF 




the eotire planet: the true Nijjan 
as the betrayer, and then ah these 
beings who must conform. 

He directed another thought 
“Has this planet always been called 
Nijja?” 

They knew of only one other 
name. Anthropological studies of 
their antiquity indicated that >at the 
time the common language had be- 
gun some indeternoinate thousands 
of years before, the name had been 
Thda, meaning Home of the Brave. 
Nijj-a, on the other hand, in their 
language meant Home of the Pure. 

Obviously, the name would have 
to have a meaning in their language 
as well as in that of the true Nijjans. 
A different meaning, of course. 

“I see,” said Cemp. 

And he did see. 

With that, he asked one more 
question, “Where can I find the one 
who requires purity?” 

“Oh, you can see him only through 
the police.” 

“Where else?” thought Cemp to 
himself, sarcastically. 

Whereupon, the exact, proper time 
having gone by, and the' exact mo- 
ment for G’Tono to awaken having 
come, he directed a thought on the 
Special People telepathic band. He 
said, “I am that Silkie who con- 
fronted you after you killed my Sdl- 
kie associate — and I’m sure now 
it was you who killed him. As I 
now understand it, this planet illu- 
strates what you meant when you 
stated Nijjans had no home planet 
in the ordinary sense. ^47/ planets 
controlled by a Nijjan are part of 
the Nijjan system — the nearest 
place, in other words, where a sin^e 



ruling Nijjan could t>e located. Is 
that correct?” 

Along with the message, Cemp 
projected the thought that woul4 
trigger the Logic of Levels cycle he 
had set up in G’Tono’s brain. Hav*- 
ing done so, Cemp spoke again to 
the focal point nearly three hundred 
miles away, “You’d better talk to 
me before it’s too late.” 

It was moments after that when 
Cemp sensed a peculiar sensation in 
his transmorpha system. N’Yata, he 
thou'ght. He remembered Baxter’s 
fear that he also might be attacked, 
and here it was. It interested him in- 
tensely to observe that it was the 
mechanism for chaniginig form that 
was affected; not surprising, really, 
but nobody had known. By the time 
he had th^ thought, he had already 
accepted his personal dislaster. Prom 
the beiginning he had had to con- 
sider himself expendable. 

Cemp felt briefly sad for Joanna. 
He presumed that he would die, and 
her life would now have to go on 
without ihim. As for what might 
happen to the Nijjans — Cemp felt 
a chill, recalling what the computer 
had predicted: that the Nijjans Logic 
of Levels would be bigger than what 
had happened to the Glis. 

Again he wondered: What could 
be bigger than that? 

The awareness remained with him 
only fleetingly. Abruptly, he didn’t 
have time to consider anything ex- 
cept what was happening to him. 

XI 

F or Cemp there was, first of ah, a 
a kaleidoscope of visual images. 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



87 




He saw Nijjan bodies and faces 
— if the upper part of the pyramidal 
shape could be considered a face. 
The images streamed by, not exactly 
silently — for thoughts came from 
some of them. 

Cemp himself seemed to be float- 
ing along in a timeless void. Each 
set of Nijjan thoughts came to him 
separate and distinct: 

“. But how did he do it? . .” 
“What exactly is happening? — ” 
not kill him and then solve 
the problem, ourselves? . “ — 

Because we don’t even know what 
part of the Nijjan brain was utilized 
for the attacl^ that’s why. Besides, 
we have no proof yet that we can kill 
him. In this Silkie, Logic of Levels 
seems to be a time phenomenon. In 
us, it’s of course the space thing — ” 
As these thoughts and others like 
them whispered into Cemp’s aware- 
ness, he was conscious of a develop- 
ing stir in ithe greater distance of 
the Nijjan world. Other minds, at 
first a few, then many, then tens 
of thousands turned their attention 
in amazement and took note of him 
and had their thoughts . and were 
hooked into G’Tono’s disaster. 

. Like an anthill deep into 
which somebody has kicked, the Nij- 
jan system began to roil and churn 
with innumerable reactions. What 
they were afraid of briefly held 
Cemp’s astonished interest: 

— Two bodies cannot occupy the 
same space or . two spaces the 
same body; there was danger that 
this would now happen. 

More basic: the space-time con- 
tinuum, though it was a self-sustain- 
ing mechanism of immense but finite 



complioation, needed Nijjans to sur- 
vive: that was the thou^t So that 
if a Nijjan were over-stimiulaited, 
space mig^ ihave a reaction. 

. That was how Lan Jedd had 
been killed: a Nijjan oonsdously 
over-stimulating jhimjceilf ia some 
small, precise way elicited a reaction 
in the space occupied by Lan’s body. 

Push at the universe, at space. A 
Nijjan might be affected. Push at a 
Nijjan, the universe would push back 
or adjust to the push in some funda- 
mental way. 

What are they implying? thought 
Cemp, staggered. What are they say- 
ing? 

Between the universe and the Nij- 
jans a symbiotic relation. If one was 
unstable, so was the other. 

And the Nijjans were becoming 
unstable. 

A s Cemp’s awareness reached that 
point, there was a flash of 
alarmed agreement that extended 
through every observing Nijjan mind. 
Whereupon, N’Yata telepathed to 
Cemp: 

“I speak for Nijja. We’re in pro- 
cess of being destroyed by a chain 
reaction. Is tiiCTc anything we can 
do to save ourselves, any agreement 
we can make? 

“In us,” N’Yata continued in that 
desperate way, “awareness of the 
connection of Mfe to all atoms in the 
universe was not dulled. Somehow, 
in those long ago days of <the be- 
ginning of things, we automatically 
worked out a method of maintaining 
consciousness without constantly en- 
dangering ourselves. Other life forms 
had to attenuate or shut off direct 



88 



IF 




contact with space and its contents. 
We Nijjans can therefore be destroy- 
ed if we are forced to a state of 
order from the chaos in which, alone, 
life can survive, and this forcing you 
have now done.” 

It was as far-fetched a story as 
Cemp had ever heard. “You’re a 
bunch of liars,” he said contemp- 
tuously, “and the proof is that 
G’Tono could be victimized by an 
overflow of opposites.” 

He broke off, “The truth is I 
couldn’t believe any promise you 
made.” 

There was a pause, brief but preg- 
nant; finally a mental sigh from 
N’Yata. “It is interesting,” she said, 
resigned, “that the one race we fear- 
ed above all others — the Silkies — 
has now made a successful attack 
on us. Because of the overweening 
pride of countless Nijjans, we are 
particularly vulnerable. Each Nij- 
jan, as he tunes in, has a Logic of 
Levels cycle triggered in him. And 
there’s nothing we can do to warn 
him ahead of time. What you’re 
saying is that you won’t listen to any 
argument against this.” 

It was more than that, Cemp saw. 
Between these two races there was 
no quick way to cooperation. That 
would be true, he speculatively re- 
alized, even if the fate of the uni- 
verse depended on it. The Nijjan 
destruction of Silkies had been too 
remorseless. 

But the fact was also, there was 
really nothing he could do. Logic of 
Levels, once started, could not be 
interrupted. The cycle would com- 
plete in them and in him and take 
whatever course the logic required. 



A brain mechanism had been tng- 
gered. The pattern of that mechan- 
ism had been set ages before, and 
it had no other way to be. 

That was as far as his thought 
had time to go. 

There was an interruption. Two 
things happened, then, almost 
simultaneously. 

From N’Yata’s mind to his there 
leaped an emotion of anguish. “Oh, 
it’s happening,” she said. 

“What’s happening?” Cemp’s mind 
yelled at her. 

If there was ever an answer from 
her, Cemp did not receive it. For 
at that precise instance he felt a 
strange, strong feehng inside him. 

That was the second event. 

H e was on Earth with Joanna. It 
was at the beginning of their 
marriage; and there she was, and 
there he was, completely real both 
of them. Outside, the sun was shin- 
ing. 

It grew dark suddenly. 

That was earlier, he realized. 
More than a hundred years before 
he was born. 

— This is the time change in 
myself, Cemp thought. Logic of 
Levels affecting him, taking him 
somehow earlier in -time, a kind of 
genetic memory journey. 

Night. A dark sky. A Silkie float- 
ed silently down from the 
heavens .... Cemp realized with 
a start: That was the first Silkie 
to come to Earth, the one that — 
it was later pretended — was creat- 
ed in a laboratory. 

The scene, so briefly observed, 
yielded to a view of the city inside 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 



89 




the Glis meteorite. There were the 
Space Silkies; and he was there, al- 
so — or so it seemed. Probably, 
it was his ancestor with his trans- 
moipha cells: the DNA-RNA mem- 
ory of earlier bodies. 

A space scene came next. A blue- 
whiite sun in the distance. Other 
Silkies around him in the darkness. A 
contented happiness was in all of 
them. 

Cemp had an impression that the 
time was long ago indeed, twenty or 
more thousand Earth-years, before 
contact with Nijjans. 

Now, a more primitive scene 
showed. Millions of years earlier, 
according to ihis impression. Some- 
thing — himself, but different, small- 
er, less intelligent, more creature- 
like — clung to a small rock in 
space. There was darkness. 

Another scene. Billions of years. 
And not darkness but brightness. 
Where? Impossible to be sure. In- 
side a sun? He vaguely suspected, 
yes. 

It was too hot. He was flung in 
a titanic eruption of matter into 
the far blackness. 

Flung earlier. 

As he receded to an even re- 
moter time, Cemp fdt himself some- 
how still connected to GTono and 
to the other Nijjans, somehow held 
to what — for want of a better un- 
derstanding — he decided was a 
mental relationship. 

Because of that tenuous mind 
connection and interaction, he was 
able to sense the Nijjan disaster 
from a safe distance in time. 

It was possible, then, that he was 
the only MvLng being who, from his 



vantage point, witnessed the destruc- 
tion of the eight-billion-light-year-in- 
diameter universe, of which Earth’s 
galaxy was but one small bit of cos- 
mic flitter. 

XII 

T he start of it was very similar 
to when the betrayal-win cycle 
in G’Tono was triggered toward ul- 
timate win during his and Cemp’s 
second confrontation. 

Swiftly, there came the momeint 
when all those connected Nijjan 
bodies reached the dividing line be- 
tween becoming ultra-small or super- 
large. But this time ithe victims had 
no choice. Winning was not involved. 
It was a Lx>gic of Levels cycle in 
its ultimate meaning, operating on 
and through innumerable individuals, 
each of whom had the potential for 
that ultimate state. 

Every rock has in it the history 
of the universe. Every life form 
has evolved from a primitive state 
to a sophisticated one. Touch the 
wellspring of that evolvement in a 
living thing — or a rock — and 
it has to remember. 

For the millions of Nijjans, it was 
the end. What was happening to 
them was a process that was not con- 
cerned with maintaining identity. 

One moment each Nijjan was a 
unit object, a living being, with lo- 
cation and mass; the next the Nijjan 
brain center that had the ability to 
move the individual Nijjan through 
space tried to move him simultane- 
ously into all spaces. Instantly, the 
entire Nijjan race was shredded into 
their component atoms. 



90 



IF 




On the object level, the process 
scattered them, put one atom here, 
another there, quadrillions more in 
as many places. 

At the moment when Nijjans be- 
came as large as the universe, the 
universe inverted in relation to them 
to its real normalcy, to the perfect 
order that is inherent in a dot the 
size of an atom, which is unaffected 
by other atoms. 

It was not a shrinking phenome- 
non. Turning inside out was the 
best analogy. The collapse of a 
bubble. 

Cemp, who was merely tuned in 
to G’Tono and the others, felt his 
own thought expand with the 
doomed Nijjans to a state that was 
an exact propK>rtion to the largeness 
of the universe with which the Nij- 
jans had interacted. 

Having become in this purely 
mental way larger than space and 
time, Cemp so to say blinked away 
his dizziness and looked around him. 

At once he saw something in the 
great dark. He was distracted and 
he forgot the dot that had been the 
universe. It thereupon disappeared. 

The tiny spot of light, the uni- 
verse, which one moment had glow- 
ed with such brilliance, winked out 
and was gone. 

Cemp was aware of its vanish- 
ing with a portion of his mind only. 
But he could not immediately turn 
his attention away from the sight 
that had made him forget. 

He was looking at the “tree.” 

He was at such a remote view- 
point, at such vastness in relation 
to all things that, yes, he saw the 
golden tree. 



Presently, he forced himself to 
look away from that jeweled thing. 

When Cemp finally, after what 
seemed to be several seconds, was 
able to consider the disappearance 
of the universe once more, he 
thought: how long has it been gone? 
A thousand, a million, a trillion 
years? Or no time at all? 

Perhaps, in some future when he 
reached this viewpoint, not by ar- 
tificial projection but by growth, he 
would be able to count the time 
elapsed in such a phenomenon. 

He was stiH thinking about it, 
bemused, when he felt an unstable- 
ness in his position. He thought, 
Oh, oh. I’m going to invert again. 

The first evidence of his unstable 
state: the glorious tree disappeared. 

Realization came that he prob- 
ably had only moments to find the 
universe. 

How do you find a universe? 

A s Cemp discovered, then, it was 
not really a problem. The en- 
tire meaning of Logic of Levels was 
based on the certainty that all life 
forms, at some inner root, know the 
origin of things, and that by the 
very nature of their structure they 
are balancing themselves against aU 
other things. 

There is no moment when the tini- 
est insect, or plant, or rock, or grain 
of sand is not interacting. The 
atoms at the centers of remote stars 
are part of that interaction. 

The problem is not is the interac- 
tion happening? The problem is that, 
in order to function, awareness of 
so much has had to be reduced. 
Such attenuation is not normally 

91 



ENEMY OF THE SILKIES 




conscious. Hence, sensitivity to many 
good things is automatically cut 
down so close to zero that, in this 
universe, apparently only the Nijjans 
had retained through ^ the vicis- 
situdes of their evolution the cellular 
method of space and control. 

As Cemp remembered his uni- 
verse it began to interact with him, 
to become in essence what he knew 
it to be. 

And there it suddenly was, a dot 
of golden brightness. 

Cemp sensed by the interaction 
he continued to feel that it was still 
re-forming deep inside itself; re- 
sponding exactly to his universal 
memory of it. He had a mighty 
thought: Before it all reverts to ex- 
actly the way it was, why don’t I 
change it? 

Obviously, there was no time for 
detailed consideration. A few flash 
thoughts, quick judgments, snap de- 
cisions — and that would be it. It 
was never or now. Forever. 

The Nijjans? 

In a way, he could understand 
that they had felt it necessary to 
protect themselves and the space- 
time continuum by destroying races 
that were capable of challenging 
Nijjan hegemony. So they were not 
as guilty as he had once considered 
them. But truth was the universe did 
not need a race that could destroy 
it. It was time the place became per- 
manent. 

Cemp refused to remember the 
Nijjans in his recollection of the 
plenum. 

So what about human beings, the 
Special People and the Space Sil- 
kies? . 



Cemp’s immediate solution: In 

his imiverse (they all became Earth 
Silkies with the ability to change 
to any form and a complete willing- 
ness to play a benevolent police role 
everywhere in space. 

And, without exception, they un- 
derstood the Nijjan method of space 
control but their ability to interact 
with space was on the small scale 
necessary for transportation. In ad- 
dition, no Silkies were subject to 
Logic of Levels, and all the effects 
of the cycle that had been triggered 
in him were reversed. Also, in case 
there was any question. Silkies were 
inunortal. 

There was no Kibmadine race — 
Cemp felt no mercy for those per- 
verted creatures. 

, .. And Earth was back with her 
own sun. 

W as it a good way for things to 
be? There was no one to tell 
him yea or nay. He thought it, and 
then it was too late to remember it 
differently. 

In a flash, the orderly perfection 
of the single light in the blackness 
. altered, expanded. As Cemp 
watched tensely, the ochre-colored 
dot reached the moment of inver- 
sion. 

For Cemp, it was the return back 
to smallness. Something grabbed 
him, did an irresistibly powerful 
thing with him, squeezed him — 
and pushed. 

When he could perceive again, 
the starry universe fitretched around 
him in every direction. 

He realized he was somewhere in 
space, his Nijjan body intact 



92 



IF 




For that super-sensiiitive shape and 
form, now that he undieirsitood iit, ori- 
entation in space was an instinct. 
Here he was; there was Earth. Cemp 
did the Nijjan space-control mani- 
pulation — and interacted with an- 
other space many (light-years distant, 
whose existence he sensed. With that 
space Cemp did the inversion pro- 
cess on a small scale, became a dot, 
became himself, became a dot . 
something to nothing to something — 
And he stepped eighty thousand 
light-years into the Silkie Foundation 
and said to Charley Baxter, “Don’t 
bother sending that ship after me. 
I won’t be needing it.” 

The thin man gazed at him, eyes 
shining. “Nat,” he breathed, “you’ve 
done it! You’ve won!” 

Cemp did not reply immediately. 
There was a question in his min^ 
Since, whale the universe was being 
destroyed and reborn, he himself had 
been in a time chanige, had he wit- 
nessed and participated in the second 
formation of the contmuum? 

Or the first? 



He realized it was a question to 
which he would now never know 
the answer. 

Besides . could it ah have been 
a fantasy, a wish that drifted through 
his mind while he was uncortscdous, 
the strangest dream ever? 

There was a great window to his 
right, one of those massive struc- 
tures that led to a balcony from 
which a Silkie could launch himself. 
Cemp walked out onto the balcony. 

It was night. Barlih’s old moon 
floated in the dark sky above, and 
there were the familiar star con- 
figurations that he knew so well. 

Standing there, Cemp began to 
feel excitement, a surginig con- 
sciousness of the permanence and 
finality of his victory. 

“I’m going to Joanna,” he an- 
nounced to Charley Baxter, who had 
oomeup behind him. 

As Cemp launched himsei^ 
the familiar universe that was 
he wa$ thinking: ‘he had greiat tfiing pi 
to tell his darling.

THE FOOD OF MARS 

by A4AX H. FLINDT 

Heroes what ancient Martians ate 
— maybe — with directions on 
how you can try it for yourselfl 



M ars is the planeft that is deemed 
most ilikely to support intelli- 
gent life. It has a canal system that 
has been seen many times all over 
the 'woorld by the most competent 
and respected observers in the as- 
tronomicaJ profession. Spectroscopic 
observations prove that the famed 
snow caps, or ice caps, at the poles 
of Mars are just that — ice on Mars. 
Professor Percival Lowell’s work 
shows .that in the spring, the rate of 
growth of the green areas adjacent 
to the canals is in perfect agreement 
with our theoretical calculations that 
indicate that their pumping rate for 
water is the most efficient one possi- 
ble for a planet with Mars’ smaller 
gravity content. The surface of Mars 
is flat, and there are few mountain 
ranges. Movement of water must, 
therefore, be by mechanical pump. 

Recent spectroscopic observations 
of the green areas of Mars show 
that the observed spectrum is more 



like the spectrum of lichen as ob- 
served here on Earth than any other 
Earth vegetation. Three or four 
blasts that looked like tiny bursts 
of light have been seen on Mars 
within the last thirty years. These 
blasts were followed by dust clouds 
that, in at least one case, were ob- 
served to persist for several days. 
This was long enough to permit ^e 
event to be confirmed by astronomi- 
cal observatories all over the globe. 

In 1956 a new green area about 
the size of Texas was observed. It 
was located in an area that had 
shown only desert before. At Mount 
Palomar in 1956 Dr. Richardson 
momentarily observed blue canals 
in the desert regions of Mars. In 
other words, he saw the water in 
the canals. The careful mathematical 
analysis of the canals that WeUs 
Webb made shows almost conclusive- 
ly that the canals are the work of 
intelligent beings. No other agency

whether natural, animal, or insect 
has ever made a network of lines to 
comipare with the map of the canal 
systems of Mars — except man. 

This, briefly, is what is known 
about Mars. A supposition will now 
be explored that can comfortably 
answer the question: Just what is 
going on on Mars? The most ob- 
vious answer is that someone, or 
something, is building canals on 
Mars for the purpose of conduct- 
ing the water from the melting ice 
caps to the equatorial desert regions 
in the spring. There it seems to be 
used to irrigate crops of lichen. 
Lichen — why lichen? Why not 
tomatoes or potatoes? Lichen, after 
all, is that odd stuff that grows on 
rocks and is of no value to anyone. 

H ere the story of Mars takes 
an unexpected turn, for there 
is reason to believe that lichen 
is grown on Mars as human food 
and that some of the forms grown 
there are a real delicacy. It is neces- 
sary to see what supportive data 
exists to substantiate these bold 
claims. First, it is found that lichen 
is not a common plant. It is aotuaiUy 
a fungus and algae living in com- 
mon-laiw marriage and is an incredi- 
bly hardy and durable organism. It 
is found on rocks in mountain ranges 
at extreme elevations where it ex- 
periences extremes of cold, moisture 
and searing heat that is fatal to 
all other plant life. Thus, the strange 
combination of algae and fungus can 
stand such extremes of temperature 
and moisture variation that it could 
live on Mars. 

Here is found, os in any theory 

THE FOOD OR MARS 



that is later proven valid by the 
advance of science, that classical 
agreement of observed phenomena 
that to the trained scientist means 
just one thing: “Ihe theory is cor- 
rect; carry it forward.” It is not 
surprising that when a U.S. scien- 
tist undertook to grow lichen it was 
in a partial vacuum that simuLated, 
as nearly as possible, the conditions 
that are understood to exist on Mars. 
The lichen grew and prospered. 

The astounding conditions under 
which this lichen grew should be 
examined. The temperature ranged 
from approximately — 100 degrees 
F. to plus 80 degrees F., and the 
pressure was approximately one 
pound per square inch. (The pres- 
sure on Earth’s surface is about 14.7 
pounds per square inch). The only 
moisture was vapor in the form of 
dew. The oxygen was very low — 
so low that man would die in it. Yet 
this lichen grew and seemed to 
thrive. There is a most happy agree- 
ment between the spectroscopic ob- 
servations th'at indicate that there 
ore lichen4ike plant growths in the 
green aireas of Mars and the astound- 
ing ability of Earth-lichen to grow 
in a simulated Martian atmosphere. 

It is seemingly foolish to consider 
that human beings or any animal for 
that matter could be living on any- 
thing so little resembling good food 
as lichen. But it happens that this 
is exactly the case. Lichen is used 
for animal food here on Barth, and 
in Japan and China it is used as a 
food delicacy. The reason that thiiR 
is so is that the plant family that 
comprises lichen is actually a large 
one (15,000 varieties). It takes in 

95 




many unobtrusive plants that we 
commonly ignore. These are plants 
which nevertheless are lichens and 
which in certain regions lend them- 
selves very nicely to the food de- 
mands of man and beast. 

In Lapland, for instance, reindeer 
moss — which is a lichen that is 
known by the scientific name of 
Cladonia rangiferina — is used in 
the winter for cattle and reindeer 
food. Another type of arctic lichen 
that is known as Iceland moss or 
Cetraria islandica is occasionally 
used as human food. In Japan and 
China people have made an art of 
fine cooking for more centuries than 
people in the Western World care 
to think about. Two varieties of a 
certain lichen family are used for 
food in those lands and they are 
considered to be real delicacies. 

If lichen is grown on Mars and 
our spectroscopes say that it or 
something yery much like it is 
grown there, then some of that 
lichen may easily be a variety or 
varieties that are usable for trans- 
formation into animal food like beef 
cattle. Other varieties may be the 
most delicious human food. This in- 
formation is remarkable because it 
so neatly dovetails into what is al- 
ready known to be (true about Mars* 
canals, polar ice caps and green 
areas. Our astronauts may take along 
whatever they may hke to eat for 
the trip to Mars, but there is a defi- 
nite chance that on Mars and on the 
trip home that they will be eating 
lichen by choice. 

T his whole lichen picture is so 
convincing that the author. 



completely carried away by the 
thought of eating Martian food, 
went out into the woods and pro- 
cured some samples of Spanish Moss 
(Dendropogon usneoides), which is 
a common lichen in California. 
When it was steeped in vinegar it 
tasted like confetti or straw, but 
when it wias cooked for ten minutes 
in water with a little salt — ah — 
that was different. It tasted very 
much like spaghetti and thoughts 
of various types of savory and 
tempting combinations came im- 
mediately to mind. The addition of 
small bits of bacon would make the 
most delicious dish while those who 
preferred the rich and wonderful 
Italian spaghetti seasonings could 
brew up savory sauces. Well, each 
cook must find his own combina- 
tion, for the author is, unfortunately, 
not a good cook. 

As a result of the happy outcome 
of the above little adventure in 
cooking lichen, the author -and his 
wife sallied forth to San Francisco 
on a beautiful autumn night. They 
hoped that in San Francisco’s 
Chinatown, which is the largest 
Chinese settlement in the United 
States, that more information could 
be obtained regarding the lichen that 
is a delicacy. The trip was success- 
ful. Edible lichen was purchased on 
Grant Avenue in Chinatown. At the 
famed Great Eastern Cafe which is 
just off Grant, the manager gave 
assurances that, with proper advance 
notificaition, he could provide edible 
lichen in a variety of food combi n- 
aitions such as soup or fried dishes 
with pork. The price for serving 
this specialty to two persons was

quoted ait about tbree doUars. 

The next day, the cxx>perative and 
intelligent Chinese proprietor of 
“The Bamboo” in Palo Alto came 
up with the information that the 
two types of Mchen that could be 
purchased in San Francisco were 
known as “The Ear of the Wood” 
and “The Ear of the Rock.” These 
highly descriptive names were literal 
English translations of the Chinese 
names for the delicacy. He further 
said that the strange thin doUar- 
sized crispy fragments required long 
cooking time and did not disintegrate 
under protracted cooking. The lichen 
derived their names from the fact 
that one type was obtained from the 
trunks of trees whfle the other type 
was taken from the surface of rocks. 
The use of the word “ear” derives 
from the way the fresh plant curls 
up when it is dried. In strange ways 
it resembles a human ear. 

It seems more logical than ever 
before to believe that the canals of 
Mars do carry water and that the 
water nourishes lichen. Does any 
reader desire some Martian food? 
He need only inquire at the nearest 
Chinese restaurant about “The Ear 
of the Rock” or “The Ear of the 
Wood” and enjoy an “out of this 
world meal.” END

Elders — and it's a good thing! 



I were absent, he paced hesitantly 

toward the arc of huge mature males 

r ie Council Fire was a great roar- out beyond the fire. Scarred old

Chimmuh, young and not yet to the firelight, walking tiredly on 

thick of hide, would ordinarily tuck all sixes. The mutter of small talk 

his three pairs of limbs beneath him died. Glesh took his place, settled 
in the shelter of the slight cliff over- himsedf on the wet ground and turn- 
hang, with the calves and females; ed his homed head slowly, counting 
but as his father and older brothers the family representatives. His wide- 



98 



ly spaced, deepset eyes lingered on 
Chimmuh. “You speak for Family 
Wurgan, youngster?” 

Chimmuh, conscious of his higher- 
pitched voice, said, “I do.” 

Glesh dipped his horns, acknowl- 
edging. “We are all here, then. I 
will talk, then we will listen to any 
who disagree.” He heaved his fore- 
body up for a moment, unfolding 
his forelegs out toward the fire. 
“Never in my lifetime, nor in my 
sire’s, has snow come this early. But 
the lore says that when snow comes 
early, it is not a freakish storm, but 
the true onset of winter.” He paused. 
The older males dipped heads in 
agreement. 

“Therefore,” Glesh went on, “we 
must expect snow the rest of the 
night, and tomorrow eight, and for 
many nights. The passes back into 
Big Valley will be too difficult to 
cross. We must take the unfamiliar 
way down Katta river and south- 
ward along the edge of the sea to 
Wintering. It will be a hard migra- 
tion. We dare not delay to collect 
fodder, but must live on what grows 
along the way. We must start in the 
morning.” He glanced around the 
arc. “I will listen now.” 

There was a moment of silence. 
Then Hutu — the young-mature 
male with the broken right-middle 
leg — muttered, “We should not 
have come across into Katta Valley.” 

G lesh inclined his head without 
rancor. “True. But the pahia- 
seed here has been rich, as we hop- 
ed, and at least we are fat to begin 
the migration. We could not know 
the winter would come so early.” 



There were mutters of agreement; 
Hutu subsided, testily. Glesh turned 
his deep eyes toward Chimmuh. 
Chimmuh squirmed. This was the 
moment when he must speak, but 
his voice would not come. 

Old Lozh filled the breach. “There 
are four sixes of prime males who 
are not with us.” 

Now Chimmuh found his vo#ce. 
“My sire, and those with him, will 
— be returning from the north with 
metal, for tools and for weapons if 
we are pursued iby Uangs. My sire 
and the others are prime, able to 
travel fast and to cross the moun- 
tains. They will have seen the win- 
ter two days ago, or three, and will 
be hurrying down Big Valley to 
reach us. They will see our tracks 
where we left Summering and fol- 
low into Katta Valley. They will be 
here in a few days.” 

There was an embarrassed silence. 
Glesh rumbled a sigh. “You do not 
understand about snow, youngster. 
It will cover our tracks. Even if your 
sire’s party is not trapped in the 
north and perhaps overwhelmed by 
Hangs, they will assume we have 
gone down Big Valley as usual.” He 
sighed again. “What of your dam? 
Is she able to migrate?” 

Chimmuh stared past the fire to 
where his mother, eyes downcast, 
lay among the females. His stomachs 
felt as if they were both full of net- 
tle-weed. “She is not. She will calve 
within days.” 

There were mutters of sympathy. 
Glesh shifted his bulk and waggled 
his head and looked as if he wished 
he were not Leader. “I must con- 
sider the Herd. We cannot wait;

nor cm we halt along the way. There 
will be several ancients left behind 
here, as well as Hutu. And Lozh 
says he will stay. Also — ” he tossed 
his head in annoyance — “my 
youngest she-calf Aiwa has sworn 
she will not go with us, but will 
try to get back to Big Valley, since 
her mate is with your sire. I cannot 
make her listen.” He stared at 
Chimmuh. “What of you, young- 
ster?” . 

Chiaumuh felt dead inside. “I can- 
not abandon my dam.” 

Glesh waited for the mutters of 
approbation to subside. “Thus be it, 
Chen. It is possible the snows may 
not be heavy; also, that the Hangs 
may not come until their normal 
season. In that case, your dam may 
calve and be fit to travel before 
long, and you can follow us. Until 
you know, it is best you stay here, 
or go higher into the mountains, 
rather than straggle and be caught 
in Katta Valley.” He looked around 
slowly. “Is there any disagreement?” 
The arc of males was silent, ex- 
cept for Hutu, who grumbled but 
didn’t actually protest. 

T he snow stopped with daylight, 
but the sky remained sullen. 
Chimmuh, shivering atop the cliff, 
stared out over the Katta Valley. 
The migration had left a broad 
beaten track down Nameless Creek, 
and now,‘ tiny with distance, it 
wound among the vertical-sided hum- 
mocks, like little mesas, on which 
the pahiagrass grew. He could only 
make out the big males plodding 
along in hollow formation, to shel- 
ter the females and calves. 



The valley looked strange, its lev- 
el floor blanketed in white. Even 
the hummocks were snowy, so that 
the upthrust seedstalks stood out 
sharply. He peered up-valley. It 
looked lifeless. Then, miles north, 
he saw movement. He crouched anx- 
iously, then saw it was only a herd 
of yenno grazing on phia-tendrils 
that hung down from the hummocks. 
That was a good sign. If the north 
carried any scent of Hangs, the yen- 
no would he running. He’d seen how 
a yenno’s six slender legs could 
flash. 

If there were no Hangs yet he 
could go down and gather pahia- 
seed. He’d need help to carry it, 
though. 

He couldn’t see over the edge of 
the cliff, but smoke-scent told him 
he was about over the campsite. He 
turned and trotted lateraUy, to where 
he could climb down.

H is dam lay with four limbs tuck- 
ed beneath her gravid flanks, 
her forelegs lifting and letting drop 
a hardwood pestle to grind seed in 
a mortar-stone. She gave him a re- 
lieved look. “I was worried, male- 
calf. You were gone long.” 

He inclined his head in greeting 
to Aiwa, Glesh’s she-calf, who squat- 
ted sullenly near the fire. “I went 
up Nameless Creek. Do you remem- 
ber where our trail down from the 
passes joined it?” 

His dam said, “I remember.” 
“WeH,” Chimmuh said, “a short 
climb up the creek to the north there 
is a big hollow with only one narrow 
exit. It is like the one Glesh showed

US and called a ‘cirque,’ left by some 
ancient river of ice. We will be 
much better hidden there. Brush 
grows on the bottom and up the 
sides until they are too steep. We 
might build a fence across the exit. 
And if we can get enough seed to 
go with brush-roots and foliage, we 
can — ” 

Aiwa was on her feet. “Did you 
go up to the pass?” 

“No.” 

She stamped about, making im- 
patient gestures with her forelimbs. 
“I am going across even if I must 
go alone!” 

Chimmuh, annoyed, said, “The 
absent ones will not be this far south 
for a few days, if at all. You must 
stay and help my dam.” 

Aiwa stamped her feet. “I will 
wait today and tomorrow. Maybe 
only Joday. Then I will go!” 
Chimmuh held his temper. He 
understood why males sometimes 
bellowed at their mates. “I cannot 
argue now. Where are the others? I 
must persuade them to go with me 
for pahia-seed.” 

His mother glanced half absently 
at his back — thinking, no doubt, 
that a male calf with dorsal spines 
hardly sprouting was too young to 
do much persuading. She said list- 
lessly, “Lozh is somewhere digging 
roots. The ancients and Hutu have 
gone to find a Dying Place.” 
Chimmuh reared his head in 
shock. “A Dying Place! But — I had 
counted on — even Hutu?” 

His dam paused wearily in her 
grinding. “Hutu’s leg is hurting him 
badly, and he sees that things are 
hopeless.” 



Chimmuh said no more. He 
bounded over to the scanty pile of 
equipment Glesh had left them, chose 
a heavy chopping-knife in a scab- 
bard and buckled it on so it hung 
at one flank. He looked back. “First 
I will find Lozh. Meanwhile, caa 
the two of you carry what we have 
here up to the cirque and build a 
fire? We will all join you there, 
though it may not be before dark.” 
Aiwa said petulantly, “We have 
the cliff here.” 

Chimmuh fought his anger. 
“There is good shelter in the cirque. 
And you will be closer to the pas- 
ses.” 

That persuaded Aiwa, but his 
dam looked at him with sad, fond 
eyes. “Must you go? Today ...” 
He said, a little harshly, “We are 
not dead yet. There will ^ a tomor- 
row and a day after tomorrow. I 
will be careful.” 

L ozh was a short gallop down the 
creek, working with a shovel 
the ruddy metal blade of which was 
worn and nicked. Chimmuh spat out, 
“Yohut! Is that the best they left?” 
Old Lozh drove the blade into the 
snowy soil and relaxed, gazing at 
C himm uh with a hint of amusement, 
standing on five limbs, the ether 
forepaw resting on the wooden spade 
handle. “There is one better, but 
this will suffice me. What did you 
see, from above?” 

“No sign of trouble, but snow 
everywhere. And I found a place 
where we might winter, if we can 
get enough food. You’ve seen hungry 
years, Lozh. Tell me. Can we live on 
roots and foliage?”

The old male gestured toward the 
pile of tubeirs he’d dug. “This par- 
ticular kind will keep us alive for a 
while, hut not healthy. Starvation is 
not our real worry, youngster. I did 
not want to speak frankly (before the 
females, but when the llangs come, 
they are voracious and vast in num- 
bers. You must have stolen away 
with the other calves at some time 
to peep at the Dying Places and 
seen the bones scattered about, with 
not even one old hide as unsavory 
as mine left to cover them. Do not 
shudder. When a krote is old and 
stiff and lame, and his joys are safe 
in the past, death is no horror. And 
llangs are merciful at least in being 
quick.” He looked at the scabbard 
Ohimmuh wore. “Were you going 
down, youngster to exterminate the 
species of llangs all by yourself?” 

Chimmuh tossed his head angrily. 
“I am going to chop pahia-seed, if 
I can persuade anyone to help me 
carry it. YohutI Were the others so 
anxious to die that they could not 
wait?” 

Lozh pulled the spade free and 
began digging slowly at another 
bush. “They have no hope. Grant 
them decency in taking themselves 
from the camp, to draw the llangs 
away from your dam.” He waggled 
his head slowly. “I hoj>e it succeeds 
for a while at least, ^mehow, one 
feels that the act of birthing should 
be allowed to occur, even if dam and 
calf perisih a day later. Perhaps then 
their spirits may find peace.” 

“Spirits!” Chimmuh snorted. “If 
those ancients would try as hard to 
live as they do to die, we might sur- 
vive the winter. I’m going down to 



talk to them. If you care to be useful 
you might help my dam and Aiwa 
move to the cirque I found.” He 
started down-creek, then turned, 
ashamed of his disrespect. “Forgive 
me. Elder. You could have gone 
with the Herd; you are not yet fee- 
ble. Why did you stay?” 

Lozh went on with his digging for 
a moment. Then he said, “It was I 
who suggested crossing over into 
this valley. Therefore, it seemed 
right that I stay. I’ll carry these roots 
up and get the camp moved. If you 
see llangs, remember that you can 
outsprint them but your wind will 
not last. And you are still agile 
enough to climb a hummock. Llangs 
cannot.” 

C himmuh found the resigned group 
huddled about a small fire in a 
little box canyon masked from the 
creek by tall brush. Besides Hutu, 
there were four old males and two 
females; the latter as scarred and 
sere-hided as the males though not 
nearly their size. Only Hutu looked 
at Chimmuh. The others, eyes dim 
with apathy and memories, slowly 
chewed their cud. 

Hutu lay on his left side, his 
splinted leg thrust out toward the 
fire. He tossed his head and rum- 
bled, “Why are you here, youngster? 
If you’re to stay with your dam, 
you should not wander about leav- 
ing tracks.” 

Chimmuh moved nearer the fire, 
stamping his feet with cold. “There 
are no Hangs in the valley yet. I am 
going to chop seed. You must all 
help carry it up to the place I have 
chosen.” 



WINTER OF THE LLANGS

Hutu snorted. “Who are you, 
^th'out one horn on your head — 
with hardly a dorsal spike, even — 
to say what we must do? We have 
said farewell to the Herd, and to 
Lozh and your dam and Aiwa. And 
now we say farewell to you. Be- 
gone.” 

Chimmuh hesitated, then burst 
out, “There is a calving to be guard- 
ed, and food to be brought for the 
dam and for Aiwa Who tends her! 
My dam cannot — cannot make 
good milk on a diet of weeds! And 
there is a fence to be built, to keep 
out the Hangs. We are the Herd now, 
all that is left here. Have you lost 
all courage, like these senile hulks?” 

Hutu rumbled ominously and 
gathered his limbs beneath him, 
wincing. But the oldest and biggest 
of the ancient males spoke, and Hutu 
waited, in deference. The ancient 
rumbled, “You can know little of 
courage, youngster, since you know 
little of life!” 

One of the females said drily, “It 
is not our fault your dam is late in 
the year with her calving.” 

Chimmuh said, “Other females 
have calved as late. If this were a 
normal year, there would be no 
trouble.” He hesitated. It was against 
all instincts to be so brash with an- 
cients. Still, he had them talking, 
at least. “You will have all winter 
to die in, if you must. Help me haul 
the seed to the new camping place. 
There will be snow tonight, to cover 
our tracks. If there are still no Hangs 
tomorrow, you can return here if 
you must. At least, then, you’ll have 
pahia-seed to chew on while' you 
wait.” 



Another old male said, “But if 
there are Hangs, we will be trapped 
with the rest of you in whatever 
place you have chosen. It is not 
right that ancients wait their end 
in a camping place.” 

Chimmuh said, “It is less right 
that grown males desert a female 
who is calving.” 

Hutu heaved himself to his feet, 
wincing as his splinted leg dangled. 
“Yohut! What is this talk of a 
fence?” 

Chimmuh told him, “I found a 
place with a narrow mouth, where 
we have everything but pahia-seed. I 
think we could fence out the Hangs.” 

The oldest male said, “We are not 
agile enough to climb mountains, 
youngster.” 

“There are no steep climbs,” 
Chimmuh said. “You can do it, 
slowly.” 

The ancient sighed and began 
heaving himself ponderously, by 
sections, to his feet. “Though you 
are hardly more than a calf, you 
preach like a nettle. GaUop on down 
and be about your chopping, so that 
we may find good loads when we 
catch up with you.”

T he snow had melted a little in 
Katta Valley, so that there was 
much mud, and from the vertical- 
sided hununocks water dripped. 
Gone were the autumn smells of 
warmth and ripe grasses. The snow 
had its own smell — watery, but in 
addition a little bitter, a little pun- 
gent, like certain roots one chewed 
for medicine. Regular valley dwel-

lesrs evidently felt dislocated. A flock 
of putak birds, scavengers, circled 
on wide wings, so higjh tfeeir shrill 
cries came down only faintly. In- 
sects crawled in the snow, moving 
Chimmuh to pity. A small verte- 
brate clung on a hanging vinelike 
pahia-tendril, shifting its six frail 
legs uncertainly, half afraid to de- 
scend. 

From the nearest hummock, at 
least four sixes of seed stalks grew 
up, twice as tall as Chimmuh’s full 
length, each bearing at the top a 
pod as big as his head. In a normal 
year, these would be nearly ready to 
split, releasing the vaned seeds to 
go gliding away haphazardly like lit- 
tle models of putak birds. Chinunuh, 
nervous on the valley floor, hurried 
to the hummock, seized a thick ten- 
dril, bent it up in a loop and tied it 
with the non-slipping knot he’d been 
taught as soon as he was old enough 
to climb. He was almost too old for 
it, now. He made a second loop in 
another tendril, lunged up and got 
one of his hind feet in each of the 
loops and 'began tying other loops 
higher up. By the time he reached 
the level top, he was puffing. 

Pahia-shoots grew thick and erect, 
so it was hard to shove his way 
through. He got a seed stalk, peered 
up to make sure the pod was ripe 
enough, drew the heavy knife and 
began to chop. A few hard strokes 
had the stalk leaning. He reared up 
and tugged at it so it would fall 
toward the edge of the hummock. 
It tilted slowly and crashed down, 
the chopped end breaking loose and 
upending so that the whole slid off. 
He heard it thud on the soil below. 



The sitalk itself could be split for 
fence^posfs, or chopped for Bieiwood. 

He worked his way around the 
hummock, cutting all the stalks that 
were near the edge, then went to his 
makeshiift ladder. It was then the 
strange discomfort — almost a panic 
— seized him. He crouched there, 
trembling and staring around, tom 
between an urge to cry out for others 
of his kind and a fear of making 
any noise. Gradually, he understood. 
It was not so much a definite fear 
as the realization of being alone. He 
had never before been long out of 
calling-distance of other krote. 

Well, he’d simply have to bear it. 
He climbed down and trotted to an- 
other hummock. It w;^ a little better 
while he worked, usually shut in by 
the grass shoots so he couldn’t see 
his loneliness. He had four hum- 
mocks harvested and was starting on 
a fifth when, faintly, he heard Hutu’s 
voice. With a glad cry, he scram- 
bled down and ran toward the voice. 

B y mid-aftemoon he’d felled all 
the ancients could haul. He rest- 
ed, watching them tie the stalks, 
pods and all, into long bundles, using 
pliant tendrils, to be slung over their 
backs. Chimmuh, who couldn’t have 
carried much anyway, stayed un- 
burdened to act as scout. 

The procession started toward the 
slopes. He ranged ahead, trotting 
back and forth across the route, 
dropping back now and then to re- 
lieve the loneliness. Above the 
clouds, the day was aging. 

Then, while they were still among 
the hummocks, he met a herd of 
fleeing yenno. 



WINTER OF THE LIANGS 



105 




The herbivores — built aloog the 
lines of krote, but smaller than 
Chinimuh — came pouring from the 
north, slender limbs flashing rhyth- 
mically, their skins, darker than his 
own, inconspicuous against the dark 
hummocks. He crouched, startled, 
then darted for shelter. The tide 
flowed around him, some of the 
males pointing horns in warning 
but not attacking. Then the tide 
ended with a few stragglers limping 
along. He ran toward his own com- 
panions. 

As soon as he was in sight, the 
old males automatically closed up 
to form a circle. He pulled up, 
gasping. “Yenno! Running!” 

Hutu growled, “Yohutl” The old- 
est male rumbled, “How hard did 
they run, youngster? Were they 
winded? Did you see their tongues?” 
“N-no.” 

“Then,” the ancient said, “we 
have a little time. And I do not 
think Hangs will come into the hills 
tonight, with yenno to interest 
them.” He peered at Chimmuh. 
“WiU you stay behind and north of 
us, youngster? If you see Hangs, or 
yenno really running, come to warn 
us at once. We cannot demand it 
of you. If you prefer, take what 
seed you can carry and hurry up to 
your dam. We wiU keep the Hangs 
occupied a while.” 

Chimmuh stared distractedly to- 
ward the mountains. “I — I could 
not carry much. I wiH stay.” 

Hutu grumbled and said harsh 
things about his broken limb and 
made a sign of good luck to Chim- 
muh. 

Chimmuh drifted north of the 



caravan. He was determined not to 
be cowardly, nor yield to his loneli- 
ness. Possibly that was why he made 
little of another herd of y^mo, nm- 
ning slightly harder than the first. 

It wasn’t long afterward that he 
saw the Hangs. 

r iis — he realized after his first 
frozen terror — was a sort of 
advance guard, not more than four 
sixes of them, trotting in a swift 
easy gait out to vaHeyward of the 
yenno’s track. They were already 
fed, perhaps, and just keeping tab 
on things. They h^ted the instant 
they saw him, fierce yeHow eyes 
startled and wary, as if they sus- 
pected a full krote herd nearby. 

Individually, they were ocJy a 
quarter of Chimmuh’s bulk, long 
and low, with wedge-shaped ears 
now stiffly erect. They were not 
bare-flank^ like krote, but had 
short, Hght gray fur all over. Some, 
the older males no doubt, had ruffs 
to protect their throats as did ma- 
ture males of Chimmuh’s own spe- 
cies. AH six paws were running-paws, 
not made for grasping, but all fear- 
somely clawed. Their long slender 
muzzles showed fangs that nearly 
paralyzed Chimmuh with fright. 

One of them broke the brief tab- 
leau by snarling. Now Chimmuh 
learned how to run. 

He ran in pure mindless panic at 
first, body throwing itself into 
swerves to avoid hummocks, lungs 
pumping with an agonized violence. 
His head jerked about, bringing his 
eyes to bear on each dimness at the 
foot of a hummock, tossing quick 
looks behind. His legs ached and felt 



106 



IF 




ready to collapse, but he streaked on« 
leaving die Hangs out of sig^t. No 
yenno could have kept pace with 
him in this initial wild hurst. Finally 
exhaustion forced him to slow. The 
Hangs were certainly on his track; 
he heard the peculiar chopped 
shrieks of their tracking. 

His mind was working now. He 
swerved around another hummock; 
shot off at nearly a right angle, to- 
ward the area where he’d chopped 
stalks. He had to give the caravan 
time. He worried whether he could 
find the right hummocks, but some 
part of his brain was taking him 
there. He saw a famiHar pattern, 
darted toward it; crouched a mo- 
ment gasping and staring back. Then 
he grasped the tendril-loops and 
hauled, himself up. His muscles 
seemed to crack, and a smaH bleat 
of agony forced itself from him, 
but he went up. Before he reached 
the top, angry snarls broke out near- 
by. He heaved desperately and 
scrambled over the edge. He would 
have fled to the very middle of the 
hummock, if the shoots hadn’t re- 
sisted. He twisted around to see his 
pursuers. 

Most of them had stopped as soon 
as they saw he was out of reach. 
Now, those turned and trotted to 
the wind-shelter of another hum- 
mock, where they sprawled loosely, 
panting, heads on their forepaws, 
yeUow eyes fixed on him. Two, 
though, had come right below him 
and were pacing about, staring up. 
He lay shuddering. His lungs ached, 
and both stomachs wanted to empty 
themselves. 

Time passed. The two Hangs pac- 



ed. The others lay lax, only moving 
their ears at some distant hunting 
cry. The sky was nearly black, 
though above the clouds at least 
one moon must be shining. Chim- 
muh’s breath was easy now, but the 
terror remained. How long would 
they wait here? 

Then one of the pair below him 
uttered a special snarl, reared up, 
and got a forepaw into one of the 
tendril-loops. He stretched, hooked 
the other forepaw in another, bunch- 
ed his hindquarters and surged up. 
Chimimuh’s panic brought him to a 
tense crouch. Surely the Hang 
couldn’t reach him! Lozh had prom- 
ised they couldn’t climb! 

But maybe he’d made the loops 
too many, and too close together. 

T he Hang stretched its body in- 
credibly, caught a hjgbieir loop. 
It heaved itself violently, missed, 
clung for a moment and tried again, 
caught the loop it wanted. Chim- 
muh could see how its wrists strained 
to stay hooked over the tendril, but 
it met his eyes and snarled a death- 
promise, and he knew it wouldn’t 
give up. He pressed back into the 
restraining grass. 

The Hang was gathering itself for 
the final stage. And now the others 
were on their feet, staring avidly. 
Suddenly Chimmuh remembered the 
scabbard that had slapped madly 
against his flank as he ran. Did it 
still hold the iknife? He could cut 
the tendrils! He roUed onto his side; 
darted a forepaw up to feeL Yes! 
He drew the knife; forced himself 
to lean forward. In the dusk, he 
couldn’t tell the right tendrils. And

now the Uanf made its final effort 
— threw itself up and got first one, 
then the other forepaw onto the 
matted edge of the hummock. Its 
yellow eyes seemed luminous. Its 
scent was almost paralyzing in Chim- 
muh’s nostrils. It snarled in triumph. 

Frantically, he swung the knife. 

The beast’s scream made him cow- 
er hack. The Hang fell, still scream- 
ing. Ohimmuh was only dimly aware 
that the knife fell too. After a mo- 
iment the thrashing about below 
made him open his eyes and peer 
down. The Hang was writhing on the 
ground, snapping at its shoulder. 
The reek of blood was sickening. 
The second Hang was dancing about 
as if puzzled. It darted in and nipped 
experimentally at the injured one’s 
flank. That one snapped back vi- 
ciously. The others were converging 
now. The wounded one got to its 
feet and loped away unevenly. Chim- 
muh had the feeling that the others 
would have chased it and torn it to 
bits, if they’d been very hungry. As 
it was, they gradually settled down 
to their vigil. 

Chimmuh let his head droop, un- 
mindful of their steady scrutiny, not 
caring that his tool — his weapon — 
lay below, unreachable. Both his 
stomachs wanted to be empty. 

He recaHed how, a calf, he’d crept 
secretly after a pair of grown males 
who’d gone to a secluded spot to 
settle a difference. He’d been sick 
then, too, as they lunged at each 
other, hooking* with horns and strik- 
ing with clawed feet, untU they were 
streaming blood. But afterward the 
eventual victor had been as sick as 
the one who lay behind. He’d stag- 



gered away by himself and retched 
awfuHy for a long time, with no sign 
of jubilation. 

Now Chimmuh understood. Even 
in necessity, to spiH the blood of 
another creature was a terrible thing. 

He lay there long after the snow 
began, long after the Hangs silently 
departed. Finally, though, it pene- 
trated his dulled mind that he was 
freezing. 

He climbed down, very stiffly, re- 
claimed the knife, scrubbed it thor- 
oughly in the snow, and hobbled 
away. He half expected to meet 
more Hangs. Evidently, though, they 
had no need yet to rove in snow- 
storms. And snow would cover his 
tracks. 

He must have staggered on half 
asleep, for it seemed both a very 
long time and a short time before 
he turned up the stretch of Nameless 
Creek that mumbled down out of 
the cirque. Ahead, he saw the glow 
of a fire. 

As gravid as his dam was, she 
lurched to her feet when he plodded 
into the fireUght. “CMdl” 

There was a confusion of beHow- 
ing and “Yohuts!” and headwag- 
gling. 

Finally Lozh sHenced it. “Let him 
sleep. He has earned it.” 

IV 

T he snow continued next morning, 
the more disturbing because it 
hid what one should see in daylight, 
reducing the world to a cliff and a 
half-circle of brushland. The camp 
place Lozh had chosen was, objec- 
tively, very good. The cliff gave shel- 



108 



IF 




ter from the north wind. One of the 
many trickles that nursed Nameless 
Creek flowed nearby. There was lev- 
el soil, upon which they’d built a 
long shelter, backed by >^e cliff, of 
upright poles roofed over slantingly, 
pahia-pod hulls serving as shingles. 
A single long fire fronted it a few 
paces out. 

It was fascinating to watch the 
snowflakes disappear into nothing as 
they met the rising warm air. 

Chimmuh’s dam lay in the dim in- 
terior, silent and withdrawn. That 
added to Chimmuh’s uneasiness. But 
the two old females placidly ground 
seed to make pahia-bread. The old 
males, including Lozh, were barely 
visible in the snowfall, collecting 
roots and foliage. There’d be no hun- 
ger for a while. Hutu lay by the fire, 
his broken leg stretched out to the 
warmth. A long application of steam- 
ing mud, followed by a more care- 
ful splint, had lessened his discom- 
fort. Only Aiwa stamped about im- 
patiently. 

When Chimmuh realized the snow 
was not going to stop, he hauled 
himself lamely to his feet and hob- 
bled out to find Lozh. 

Lozh was using the imperfect 
shovel again. He stopped and peered 
at Chimmuh. “You are not at peace, 
youngster.” 

Chimmuh spoke with respect. 
“Nor would the others be, Elder, if 
they had met the Hangs as I did.” 

Lozh waggled his head. “True. I 
was looking where we might build 
your fence. We will not have enough 
posts. Anyway, there is not soft soil 
all the way across. We cannot erect 
posts in solid rock.” 



Chimmuh shifted his feet for 
warmth. “What then?” 

Lozh said, “We can only gather 
loose rocks and pile them. I was 
hoping the snow would stop so we 
could find some. Have you another 
harangue in mind, to put the an- 
cients to work?” 

Chimmuh said a little huffily, 
“Let us simply start work and shame 
them into joining.” 

T he old male who was spokesman 
for the four had, it developed, 
experience with fences. He took a 
sharpened post and thrust it lightly 
into the ground. “It is done thus. 
Now, since my forepaws are not 
much good for grasping, I must rear 
up and put this thick board across 
the top, so I can bring enough of 
my weight to bear.” He did so, 
gruntingly, and the post slid a fifth 
of its length into the ground. “So. 
Now, that thick one about here, I 
think — it will be good for a gate- 
post.” Amused, he watched Chim- 
muh’s effort. “You see, youngster? 
Your forepaws are deft for grasping, 
but you do not have the weight. I 
have weight to spare, but cannot 
grasp well. It is one of life’s jokes. 
A similar one exists in the matter 
of dealing with females . but you 
will not bother about that for three 
years, or four.” He took hold of the 
post. “Permit me.” 

There were enough posts for the 
stretch of soft soil, set closely so no 
Hang could squeeze through. That 
left both ends, plus Nameless Creek, 
which must be closed with a lattice 
of brush-trunks that wouldn’t dam 
the water. The chore of gathering

The snow stopped in mid-after- 
noon, but ihe night was cold. Chim- 
inuh slept fitfully. Once or twice he 
heard mother moan in her sleep. 
3ut ^d|mt distuilbed him more was 
[he dSt^t tracking cry of Hangs, 

' omewhete down Nameless Creek. 
He (wias about with the first daylight, 
anxious to resume work on the 
fence. By evening, when it was still 
not snowing, the woiik was almost 
finished, though the rocky ends must 
still be (built 'higher. And it was that 
evening that Chimmuh, peering be- 
tween the posts, saw a group of 
Hangs down Nameless Greek. They 
were staring toward the cirque, lift- 
ing their muzzles as if either the 
scent of krote or the drifting wood- 
smoke were puzzling. Finally they 
trotted down the creek. 

Chimmuh, shaken, sought out 
*Lozh. “Supposing, Elder, the fence 
keeps out Hangs indefinitely. We wHl 
run out of pahia seed before long. 
Could we make trips for more, while 
it was snowing?” 

Lozh waggled his head doubtfuHy. 
“As few and as feeble as we are, I 
fear not. One or two trips, soon, 
perhaps. But as winter extends and 
the Hangs grow hungry, they’U be 
less particular about the weather.” 
He started to say more, but paused, 
staring toward the fire. 

Chimmuh saw the females gather- 
ed there. He galloped that way. One 
of the she-ancients rumbled at him 
and moved to block him, then, re- 



menbering who he was, moved 
aside. He stopped, stiff-legged, star- 
ing at the pale-hided thing eagerly 
nursing at his mother’s beHy. She 
looked up, eyes tired but bright with 
emotions he didn’t entirely under- 
stand. “Male-child, you have a small 
sister.” 

H e must have slept soundly, for 
the trouble that night was well 
evolved before he heard it. 

He scrambled to his feet, full of 
panic and the stupidness of slumber, 
craning his neck to see 'beyond the 
fire. The bulky forms of the four 
old males loomed there, motionless. 
From down-cirque he heard Hutu 
and Lozh bellowing, Aiwa scream- 
ing, and a bedlam of snarls and 
shrieks that could only be Hangs. 
He was so weak with terror he could 
hardly move; but he forced himself 
into action, grabbed the shovel that 
was the nearest weapon and some- 
how got to one end of the fire. 

He was nearly trampled as two of 
the old males, their minds working 
now as well as their instincts, wheel- 
ed to occupy the gap between that 
end of the fire and the cliff. The 
other two, presumably, were at the 
other end. Then, as he started to- 
ward the fence, Aiwa almost bowled 
him over. He had wit enough to 
thrust with the shovel-blade at the 
dim shape snapping at her heels. 
He felt the impact, saw Wood gush 
from the Hang’s chest. It went 
sprawling and screaming. Two more 
came out of the dark, split around 
ham and darted on. StiH another ap- 
peared, and he thrust at it with 
shovel. He hit it, not solidly, and it

IF 




turned and disappeared into the 
dark. He heard a thump and a shriek 
behind him as one of the pair that 
had avoided him got too close to 
the big males. Its partner shot by 
him in retreat. Chimmuh galloped 
into the dark, dreading what he’d 
find. As his eyes adjusted he saw 
a writhing knot of shadows at the 
gate. His legs kept going. 

Hutu lay motionless and silent in 
the snow. Lozh, his tail to the fence, 
was standing, off a full six Hangs 
that darted about him, looking for 
an opening. Three or four other 
Hangs lay dead. Chimmuh hurtled 
in, shovel poised. He realized that 
the gate was shut, with a horde of 
Hangs clamoring outside. The ones 
around Lozh saw him coming and 
broke. He thrust and caught one 
full in the flank. The rest, except 
one, darted to his right along the 
fence, thinking now only of escape. 
The single one swerved around him 
and went after its fellows. Lozh bel- 
lowed, “Come! Don’t give them 
time to think!” 

The snow was heaped up at the 
foot of the slope, and against the 
rock fence. The beasts floundered in 
it, trying to climb free. Chimmuh, 
mind hardly working, crippled an- 
other with the shovel, but that was 
his last contribution to the action. 
Lozh finished the killing. 

Chimmuh stood shaking with re- 
action. Finally he gasped, “Hutu?” 

Lozh rumbled savagely, “Hutu is 
dead. He sold his life to get that 
gate shut.” He reached out, picked 
up a dead Hang and heaved it might- 
ily over the fence. He reached for 
another, but paused. “No; one is 



enough to show them now. We’ll 
skin the others first. We’ll need 
warm pelts.” 

By the time they got back to the 
gate, the pack outside had taken it- 
self off. Hutu’s blood was a dark 
congealed blob in the snow. His 
throat ruff had not been enough 
against so many slashing fangs. 

Chimmuh followed in a daze as 
Lozh marched toward the fire. 

V 

A iwa lay huddled between the old 
females. Lozh prodded at her, 
not gently. “Why did you do it?” 
Her flanks heaved with emotion, 
but she was silent. Lozh prodded 
harder. “Why did you open the 
gate?” 

This time she lifted her head. Her 
eyes were duU with inward pain. “I 
didn’t know there’d be Hangs near. 
I was going to — to slip away and 
cross the mountains to find my 
mate.” 

One of the old males rumbled, “A 
fool’s errand. Do you think, now, 
he would be alive even if you found 
him? His bones lie somewhere in the 
north!” 

Aiwa put her head down again. 
Lozh left her. 

There was talk about Hutu’s 
corpse. The decision was to leave it 
until morning. Silent with grief, the 
camp settled down. 

Chimmuh moved out beyond one 
end of the fire and huddled against 
the cliff. He wanted to be able to 
see the fence without the fire glare 
in his eyes. The fence was barely 
visible in the dim light. The rest 



112 



IF 




of the cirque was a ghostly, un- 
easy place, with faint, dancing 
gleams and shadows. After a while 
he got up and went to find Lozh. 

The old male lay at the other end 
of the fire. He lifted his head as 
Chimmuh approached. “Can you not 
sleep, youngster?” 

“No. Elder, I know very little 
lore, but it seems to me that we 
can’t hope to survive long as things 
are. What do you really feel are the 
chances my sire is still olive and 
will be going down Big Valley?” 
Lozh stared into the fire. “Your 
thoughts are mine, too. The Hangs 
are not totally irresistable. We have 
seen how awkward they are in snow 
too deep for them, and they die easi- 
ly under heavy blows. If your sire 
and brothers and those with them 
learned quickly, they might fight 
their way down Big Valley. If I 
were more agHe — ” 

Chimmuh interrupted impatiently. 
“/ am best fitted to cross the moun- 
tains. And if I found my sire’s party, 
we would not have to worry about 
starving. So many prime males could 
travel down Nameless Creek and re- 
tiu*n with pahia-seed every few days, 
if necessary. Could they not?” 

Lozh waggled his head. “I would 
not choose it as a pastime. But prob- 
ably they could. Are you willing to 
try the mountains?” 

Chimmuh stamped his feet for 
warmth. “Of course. But do you 
think my sire would already have 
passed by?” 

“That,” Lozh rumbled, “depends 
upon many things we do not iknow. 
But every day increased the likeli- 
hood.” 



Chimmuh said, “I can start to- 
morrow, if it snows. The Hangs seem 
to retire down-creek when it snows.” 
“Possibly,” Lozh said, “but I 
would think it wiser after dark. And 
you cannot go without preparation. 
Packs must be made up, for you’U 
need food and firewood. And we’U 
skin those dead Hangs for pelts. Rest, 
now; I will keep watch. Tomorrow 
may do its own planning.” 

T he morning was overcast, but 
snowless. Icy wind whipped 
over the north rim of the cirque, 
seizing upon the smoke from the 
fire and whirling it away. The four 
ancient males lay chewing their cud 
and discussing Hutu’s corpse. They 
favored dragging it to a spot near 
the left end of the fence, where they 
could pHe brush over it, then snow. 
They were disturbed that he hadn’t 
been able to get to a Dying Place 
and seemed worried that they them- 
selves might meet the same (Hsgrace. 
Chimmuh, after listening a moment, 
gaHoped away angrily toward the 
fence, to peer down-creek. There 
were no Hangs in sight, but he could 
hear them somewhere. Lozh said he 
must not start yet. 

He plodded back to the fire. His 
dam was well enough now to walk 
from the shelter, the she-calf wob- 
bling after her. “Male-child,” she 
said sadly, “you have risked your- 
self enough. Must you do more?” 
He fought impatience. “Who but 
me? And would you want my sire 
to travel on south without knowing 
we are here?” 

She gazed at him quietly for a 
moment, glanced at the calf, which 



WINTER OF THE LLANOS 



113 




was staring wide-eyed at the fire, and 
dipped her head in acquiescence. 
‘HTare well for yourself.” She turned 
and nuzzled the calf gently back 
under the shelter. 

There was no snow by nightfall, 
but the llang-sounds were far down- 
creek. Chimmuh stood at the gate, 
peering out with mixed filings. 

Lozh plodded toward him, carry- 
ing things. “Here are pelts enou^ 
to lie on, and to cover you. I had 
the females scrape them thoroughly 
and rub ashes into them, so they 
shouldn’t be unbearable. And here’s 
a bit of lore I learned once.” He 
displayed some oddly shaped pieces 
of pelt. 

“Put these on your feet like this, 
fur side in, and tie them thus. They 
will keep your toes from freezing. 
And this — you hang it around your 
neck, so the pouch is convenient to 
thrust your forepaws into. You may 
prefer at times, when you rest, not 
to build a fire. Huddle, if you can, 
in a corner of rock, or at worst in 
deep snow. The snow will not freeze 
you as quickly as the wind. Do not 
get too cold or tired or hungry, or 
your strength will desert you with 
little warning. Think well before 
making irreversible decisions.” 

Chimmuh said, “I will travel fast. 
I shall not take very long in the 
passes.” 

Lozh rumbled a sigh. “And do not 
be overconfident. It will be harder 
than you think. The cold and the 
high thin air are things you are not 
used to.” 

Chinunuh shifted his feet impa- 
tiently. “Will you help me with these 
knots?” 



I t seemed to Chimmuh that the 
faint noises Lozh made opening 
the gate and closhig it would draw 
every Hang within a day’s gallop. He 
crouched for a moment staring 
down-creek, glanced back at the 
quartet of males guarding the gate, 
dipped his head to Lozh and ran 
quietly for the right-hand slope. He 
climbed far enough to see over the 
brush along the creek, then trotted 
carefully along the slope, eyes and 
ears straining. The crackling of the 
fire was far behind him, and all he 
could hear now was the soft voice of 
Nameless Creek and the cold wind 
plucking at the ‘brush and snow. He 
looked back. He could see nothing 
but the fence silhouetted against the 
fire glow. He went on. 

The mountain’s shoulder curved 
away ifrom Nameless Creek, and now 
the cirque was out of sight. Some- 
where, down-creek, there was a short 
outburst of Hang snarls, which hast- 
ened him a little. He went farther 
around the slope and was in the 
ravine that climbed westward. Be- 
fore long, that was bare of brush. 
Now there’d be no sudden ambushes. 

He found a place that kept him 
tolerably warm without exhausting 
him, but to hold it he had to stay 
out of snowdrifts, which took some 
thought. He tried to recaH what this 
ravine had been like when the Herd 
came down it. Passably free of boul- 
ders, he thought, but his footing was 
a little nervous. 

The wind came over the north 
slope, swirling in the ravine, icily. 
He stopped to adjust a foot covering 
and was shivering at once. He climb- 
ed on. After a while a light snow- 



114 



IF 




fall began, increasing ibis sense of 
isolation. But proib^ly he didn’t 
have to worry about Bangs now. He 
could stop, when he was tired 
enough, and get warm. 

He remembered that the opposite 
side of this canyon had been crum- 
bled at one point, with a rock slide 
and some shallow caves above it. 
Had he passed that already? Things 
looked so different. But his instincts 
said the place was still ahead. He 
trotted on wearily. Then, where a 
side canyon split off, he had a flash 
of memory. The rook slide wasn’t 
far. 

He reached it and stood peering 
up the white slope. Could he climb 
the slide? He crossed the ravine and 
started up, settling five paws care- 
fully before moving the sixth. It 
wasn’t too difficult. He would have 
liked a torch to see into the caves, 
but building a fire was a chore, so 
he settled for listening and sniffing. 
The caves were empty. He Chose one 
with a level floor just big enough to 
curl up on, brushed out the snow, 
spread some pelts and settled him- 
self. He decided against a fire. With 
more pelts spread over him, he was 
warm enough. He chewed a mouth- 
ful of pahia-seed and slept. 

Snow was intermittent the next 
day, but the going was harder, be- 
cause now the air was thin and his 
lungs labored. Also, his body warmth 
seemed to flood away alanmingly. 
He had to stop several times, and 
that night he built a fire in the best 
shelter he could find. He had to 
work very long with the spinning- 
stick until the shaved kindling ig- 
nited and his forepaws were cramp- 



ed and exhausted. But once he got 
a few big sticks buiming, everything 
was fine. He dried out the pelts and 
foot coverings and what he could 
of the packs. 

Sometime during the next day, 
which was snowy, he got lost. 

The blind canyon he blundered 
into was short, so he soon realized 
his mistake, but momentarily he pan- 
icked. He turned and floundered 
back wildly, going eastward along 
his own tracks, not thinking at all 
until he tripped and went sprawling. 
He lay there, gasping and thinking 
of the cirque, with its warmth and 
the companionship of other krote. 
Then, slowly, reason returned. There 
was no safety in failure. He strug- 
gled up — shockingly stiff and weak 
— and turned westward again, past 
the blind canyon. At the first good 
rock-shelter, he bundled himself in 
the pelts, piling the other things 
around him, and got warm. 

Before nightfall he was definitely 
descending. And now he recognized 
his surroimdings. 

This ravine would lead down to a 
creek which flowed into Big Valley. 
The air would be getting better 
again, and he wouldn’t be constant- 
ly laboring uphill. But those diffi- 
culties would be exchanged for an- 
other. Big Valley was no doubt 
swarming with Hangs. 

VI 

O n a cold but snowless morning, 
he lay on a finger-ridge and 
stared out over Big Valley. Beyond 
a wide stretch of hummocks, the 
river wound its broad channel. 



WINTER OF THE LUNGS 



115 




Movement, closer, caught fads eye. 
A pack of Hangs, tiny with distance, 
trotted along. The snow barely cov- 
ered their feet. Evidently there 
hadn’t been much in Big Valley. 

He saw three or four other packs, 
one of them in full chase after some- 
thing. The choppy pursuit cry reach- 
ed him faintly and made him shiver 
beneath his covers. He obviously 
couldn’t go down into the valley in 
clear weather, if at all. 

The summering camp was south 
of here, on this side of the valley — 
not a long trot, on level ground. He 
stared at the next ridge, then looked 
inland. If he followed the contour 
of the land, it would take him days. 
So, he must cross the ravines. He 
watched this one for a while and saw 
nothing but putak birds soaring low 
over some carrion. Loading himself, 
he started down. 

As he reached brush, something 
small darted from before him, mak- 
ing him leap. He went on, sense 
alert. At the bottom he crossed a 
small creek and stopped to listen. No 
sounds close. He started up the other 
slope. 

He wasn’t yet clear of the brush 
when he heard a shrill chopped cry 
behind him . 

He ran, equipment slapping 
against his flanks. Something under 
the snow tripped him, and he went 
sprawling. He got up, wincing with 
pain, and went on. Other Hang 
voices had joined in, so there was 
no doubt they were on his track. He 
headed for a part of the slope where 
the snow looked thicker. His lungs 
already ached. When the Hangs 
burst from the brush and saw him. 



he knew it by the sudden urgency 
of their cries. He was having to 
make high leaps in the snow now. 
What would he do at the top of the 
ridge? If he turned up it, would 
they stay in the ravine, paraHeling 
him, to cut hitn off? No; they were 
charging up the slope. He realized 
that his lead in elevation was as good 
as a long lead on the level. He got 
to the rounding-off and stopped al- 
most impudently to watch them. Let 
them struggle in the deep snow, then. 

He trotted up-ridge, on easy foot- 
ing now, watched them flounder, 
then passed over the brow of the 
ridge out of their sight. He slowed 
to peer into the next ravine. If he 
ran into another pack, he was in bad 
trouble — his lungs and muscles 
couldn’t handle another such flight. 
But he was farther up this ravine, 
and the brush was thinner, with no 
sign of Hangs. 

He plunged down the slope and 
across the bottom and picked the 
easiest ways up the far ridge. When 
he heard his pursuers top the one 
he’d left, he turned to watch them. 
They stood in a tight group, staring 
at him, but they’d had enough of 
the chase. 

He went on at a bearable pace, 
crossing several more ridges. He saw 
and heard Hangs, but none close. By 
late afternoon he was within sight 
of the summering place. 

T he old camp was in a deep ravine 
that had a fair-sized creek and 
a steep northern side for shelter. 
Each spring, arriving, Chimmuh had 
seen the previous year’s fire sites, 
winter-washed but not obliterated. It 



116 



IF 




was strange now to see the unbroken 
blanket of snow. Even the rocks ar- 
ranged into cooking places were 
mounded over. Here and there were 
abandoned baskets and such, also 
covered. There were no shelters 
standing, since they’d been torn 
down for fuel on the mountain cross- 
ing. 

There were no krote tracks or 
other signs that his sire’s party had 
been there. A day or two of snow, 
doubtless, would cover such tracks. 
There were Hang tracks — every- 
where. And those were fresh. 

His stomachs felt heavy with frus- 
tration. What a forlorn mission this 
was! Even if the metal-gathering 
party still lived, wasn’t it foolish to 
expect them to fight their way down 
the length of Big Valley? Wouldn’t 
they find some haven in the north, 
as Chimmuh and his group had? 
Surely they’d presume the Herd 
would be long gone. So, even if they 
did come down Big Valley, why 
would they bother with the summer- 
ing place? Wouldn’t they go down 
the river channel, where there was 
only short brush and long open 
stretches of bottomland? 

Unless they hoped for some mes- 
sage left at the campsite. 

There was, he thought, only a 
faint hope that they’d still come. But 
it was the only hope, so he must 
wait. The trouble was, he had food 
and fuel for only a few days. 

If he could go down into the val- 
ley and climb a hummock, he’d have 
everything he needed. The pahia- 
seed hadn’t been rich in Big Valley 
this year, but he could exist on it. 
Would he get the chance? It wasn’t 



snowing now, here. Anyway, by this 
time the Hangs might be hungry 
enough to ignore snowfall. 

He stared at the campsite. If he 
could at least get that far, he could 
leave a cairn with a message — 
pile rocks up, and find a bit of char- 
coal to draw on a slab of wood. 
What kind of drawing? A sketch of 
a female krote and a smaU calf and 
an arrow pointing in the direction 
of the mountain passes? Not very 
understandable. It might be that no 
one with his father had ever seen 
the passes. 

Anyway, for now, he’d have to 
stay where he was. Should he build 
a fire? The smoke would be visible 
quite a way, and at night the fire 
would show. 

At least it was activity. He found 
a level spot and shov^ snow off 
it; unpacked his goods. This time he 
took pains shaving the kindling and, 
with the lower air, had no trouble. 

The warmth was wonderful, but 
the smoke was a disappointing bea- 
con. It swirled up only a little way 
then whipped south with the wind. 
The afternoon dragged by. He ate, 
and tried to rest, and frett^. 

Night came crisp and snowless. 
He worried that he was using wood 
recklessly and that the fire would 
attract Hangs. Almost he would have 
welcomed seeing a few, if they didn’t 
come close — his solitude was agony 
again. It always was, when he didn’t 
have something to keep him busy. 
Now and then he heard Hangs. Once 
a pack of them went by at the foot 
of his ridge, and he tensed for flight, 
but they were on some track. He 
imagined their yellow eyes staring 



V/INTER OF THE LLANGS 



117 




up taward the fire as they passed. 

Then, sometime during the night, 
it began to snow, 

VII 

H e tensed in uncertainty. Should 
he quench the fire to save 
wood? It couldn’t he seen far now. 
Should he sneak down to the camp- 
site? He might not get another 
chance. And it would be good to 
have the fire to return to. He lis- 
tened. Was that a hang? If so, it was 
far out in the valley. And ailmost 
any risk seemed better than just hud- 
dling here. 

He took his chopping-knife and 
started down the slope. At the edge 
of the brush he turned down-ravine, 
shying at every mound in the snow. 
He could barely make out the fire’s 
glow now. 

Finally, a snow mound had a 
familiar shape. He ran to it, thrust- 
ing his forepaws into the snow to 
feel the cooking stones, as if they 
were old friends. Presently he began 
to shift them into a ground layer for 
a cairn. Then he went to the next 
cluster for more. He tried to be 
quiet, but the stones made a dis- 
tressing amount of noise. He paused 
to listen. Nothing. But to his im- 
agination then ni'ght was full of steal- 
thy paw^falls. He had to go farther 
to get more stones. 

When he had a pyramid half as 
hjgh as himself he was satisfied the 
siiow would not hide it. Now, what 
about a message? There’d be no con- 
venient flat slabs of wood here. He 
should have thought about that be- 
fore he left the fire. Well, then a 



sharpened twig, to point in the right 
direction? A poor message. Maybe 
he’d beter get back up to the fire; 
make a second trip while the snow 
lasted. 

He started in that direction — 
and heard a snarl somewhere ahead. 

He whirled and ran the other way, 
blindly. After a few strides he tum^ 
up the slope. But here it was too 
steep; he lost footing and slid, floun- 
dering. The Hangs were clamoring 
now. He scrambled to his feet and 
darted away from the slope. He 
knew (this ravine, knew its flat floor 
and the gentler slope on the far side. 
He plunged through brush; reached 
the creek and bounded across it, 
splashing in icy water, tore through 
the brush on the far side, falling at 
least twice. Then he was on the up- 
curving slope. He was gasping, but 
he could tell by their cries that the 
Hangs were breathing hard too. He 
headed by memory for a slight gully 
where the snow would be deeper. 
He stumibled into it and climbed. 

Eventually, dazed with fear and 
exhaustion, he gained the top of the 
ridge and went along it, toward high- 
er ground. He could tell when the 
Hangs hit deeper snow. Evidently 
they were already tired from some 
earlier chase — this must be the 
bunch that had gone up-ravine ear- 
lier, as he huddled by his fire — for 
they gave up quickly, and he heard 
them no more. 

But now he was far from his fire 
and all his equipment. Even the 
chopping^knife lay somewhere near 
the stone caim. He peered across 
the ravine. If the fire still burned, 
the snowfall ihid it completely. How 

IF 



118 




l«ng would it take him to plod in- 
land, cross the ravine high up and 
come back down the other ridge? 

Without even his foot coverings, 
he trembled violently now. He tried 
to hurry on, to warm himself, but 
he was too exhausted. Dare he curl 
up in deep snow and rest a while? 
He didn’t think any Hangs would 
come up here. The snowfall would 
quickly cover his scent, if not his 
deep tracks. 

He couldn’t go on without rest. 

He shoved a pile of snow together 
and burrowed into it, knowing dim- 
ly that he mustn’t rest too long, or 
he’d be too frozen to walk. But, curl- 
ed into a ball with his paws tucked 
in, he felt surprisingly well. He was 
cold, but at least the wind didn’t tear 
at him. Maybe he could rest here 
till daylight. 

GraduaUy, his trembling stopped. 
His body seemed to be accepting 
the cold. He drowsed. 

Vaguely, once, he realized it was 
daylight, but that didn’t matter. He 
stirred feebly, relieving a cramp, and 
slept again. 

Then one voice cut through to 
him — a voice as familiar as his 
own limbs, a full male voice he’d 
known aU his life. “Male-calf I Rouse 
yourself! We found the cairn and 
your tracks. What are you doing 
here? Where is your dam?” 

r iey had strange artifacts that no 
lore had ever mentioned. They 
wore pelts stitched together to cover 
their whole bodies, except the Hmbs 
and elaborate foot coverings. Tliey 
had weapoiK larger than a spade, 
with fearsome points of hammered 



ruddy metal. They had flat platforms 
of hewed pahia-stalk, floored over 
with thin-beaten metal, on which 
permanent fires burned and which 
they dragged after them, slipping 
easily and amazingly over the snow. 
Others of those platforms bore quan- 
tities of metal or chopped wood, or 
pouches bulging with pahia-seed. For 
part of the way Chimmuh had ridden 
on one of those platforms. Now, 
rested, he trotted beside his sire. 

Wurgan turned his big head. “We 
had desperate times before we learn- 
ed to cope with everything. Yohut! 
The Hangs were everywhere! We had 
to devise new things.” He peered 
anxiously at Chimmuh. “Was that 
fence of yours secure? Do you think 
Lozh wHl have been able to cope 
with things?” 

Chimmuh said, “He did not act at 
all senHe. And I think the ancients 
are resigned to living another year.” 

Wurgan waggled his head in 
amusement. Then he said, “A new 
she-calf! How much farther?” 

“We wiH be there soon,” Chim- 
muh told him. He tried to sound 
confident. “The winter is not bad, 
when one learns its ways. And Hangs 
aren’t so much.” 

Nevertheless, he tensed nervously 
when he saw a smaH pack of Hangs 
ahead, just where the ravine con- 
verged with Nameless Creek. He felt 
much better when the beasts, after 
staring for a moment at the oncom- 
ing phalanx of huge male krote, 
turned, snarling, and skulked away. 

And he felt even better when, 
turning up Nameless Creek, he saw 
the fence stiH intact and smoke ris- 
ing beyond it. END

If was a pleasant little hunting trip 
in the sun, the quarry a panther as 
big — and deadly! — as a dinosaurl 



I t isn’t often that a mu panther 
is loose around here. When one 
is, the farmers and breeders usually 
call on Everret, Mader & Crawford, 
C.P.H. I’m the Everret part of it, 
Barry Everret, and the chief part- 
ner. 

We were loafing around the of- 
fice in Denver, throwing opinions 
on some new armament round-robin 
style, when we got the word that a 
cat was loose north of us. 

“Barry, I don’t like the feel of 
those new Brownings that were sent 
out. They’re made for a factory load, 
and the special slugs you wanted 
tested out throw the balance off, as 
well as — ” The telephone cut Jes- 
se Matler off with its nasal buzz. He 
grabbed it resignedly. 

It really isn’t often that we get 
a panther. Cougars are our biggest 
problem, ever since the *92 blow- 



ups. Occasionally panthers show up, 
hut the ratio was eight to one, at 
least. So when one comes arouBd 
from up in the Rockies and slashes 
some breeders’ mu steers, we usually 
get the job. Even young Brad Rod- 
gers out on his father’s spread knew 
©ur reputation as the best profes- 
sional hunters in four states; the 
Certified before our names could 
tell anyone that at a glance. It was 
Rodgers on the line, from the half- 
million acre spread of his up in 
Wyoming. 

Jesse hung up and turned to us. 

“Rodgers says they’ve lost four 
prize steers in two nights. They 
weighed in at ten tons each and 
stood thirty hands high, so he’s 
lost quite a lot. They were champion 
stock. He wants us up there right 
away.” 

“We’d better get up there, then,” 



121 




Bill Crawford said, with his per- 
soBalized sarcastic drawl. he 
loses any more stock like that he 
won’t he able to afford our services. 
He must know we don’t work for 
peanuts. Anyway, since when is 
Rodgers running his spread? From 
all accounts he couldn’t tell a prize 
steer from a cow.” 

He was perfectly right, of course; 
just one look at Rodgers would be 
enough to convince anyone that he 
was -about as competent as a Mon- 
golian idiot. Jesse just ignored Bill 
and continued. 

“He postitively identified the 
tracks as panther’s, and all of six- 
teen inches across.” 

T hat sobered Bill up right away. 

We knew then that it would be 
one heck of a cat; body symmetry 
would make it thirty-five feet long, 
and maybe fifty tons in weight. That 
would 1 ^ -a record; so in six hours 
we had packed a full expedition and 
in another four we stood in front 
of the Rodgers ranch house. It look- 
ed like pure Park Avenue. 

Jesse Matler and Bill Crawford 
have been partners with me for ten 
years now, and friends before that. 
Matler is the bigger of the two, 
a huge man, built like a boulder, 
with hands that can pulverize sand- 
stone. But Jesse’s one of the easiest- 
going people I know, until he gets 
mad. That’s very seldom, but when 
it happens it’s a perfect case history 
of midtiple personality. Jesse turns 
into a reasonable facsimile of a 
charging hippo. Aside from that, he’s 
one of those pro hunters who cut 
their teeth on a .30-30. He grew up 



in South Africa, the son of the own- 
er of one of die last great private 
preserves in the Continent. He got 
his first lion when he was sixteen. 
It was normal sized because of the 
scarcity of power plants in Africa; 
the unknown blowups in America 
had not affected them at all. That 
had been twentynfive years ago and 
seventy-five years from the blow- 
ups, so few mutations had shown up 
at that time anyway. 

His first rhino fell a year later; 
the same mad rhino had killed his 
father a few hours before, so that 
hunt was more than for pleasure or 
profit. Jesse sold the preserve to the 
government soon afterwards, not by 
choice but because of a large land- 
reclamation program under way. He 
moved back to his father’s native 
America and met Bill and me at a 
hunting lodge in California where 
he was listlessly teaching greenhorns 
how to hunt like a pro. 

That was fifteen years ago. Since 
then Jesse has become the backbone 
of EMC, CPH. God knows he 
doesn’t need the money we collect; 
his father’s land in Africa paid off 
nicely. But Jesse could no more give 
up hunting than Minnesota Fats 
could quit pool. 

Bill Crawford is almost opposite 
Jesse in build and temperament, but 
just as skilled at his sp^ialty. He’s 
about average height land weight, 
but is solid rock, a (high-rankiing 
karate beltnholder. He was an artil- 
lery specialist in the Army. He can 
handle a 188-mm. howitzer like it 
was a popgun, with either atomic 
or chemical explosives in the charge. 
He cut his teeth on a recoilless rifle, 



122 



IF 




not unlike our own antitank gun. 
And when you’ve got forty tons of 
cat moving at you, the boom of the 
big gun over your head is mighty 
welcome and cheering. 

And then there’s Schultz, my mu 
dog with a talent for telepathy and 
such. I had Schultz custom-bred 
from prize German-Shepherd stock, 
specially trained for hunting pur- 
poses. The fact that a phenomenal 
intelligence went along with the psi 
mad Schultz a good friend too. 

W e’ve been contriving to find 
ourselves a mu panther for a 
while. Now, since we tracked this 
cat down on the Rodgers land, re- 
ports have been coming in of some 
more sightings in the area. Some, 
I guess, are cranks, because of the 
widespread publicity after Brad Rod- 
gers died on the hunt. The inquest 
cleared us of any foul play. But it 
was the one hunt I’ll never forget; I 
doubt if we’ll ever meet up with 
another cat like that one. At any 
rate, I hope not. 

We’ve been controlling mutations 
commercially for some time now, 
ever since the early successes with 
the chromosome-controls were de- 
veloped in the early *70’s. Now it’s 
the world’s largest industry. It ought 
to be. It solved the world’s food 
problems, since fifty-pound cabbages 
can go a long way. But the blowups 
of the big Nevada and Colorado 
nuclear power plants started a wild- 
cat chain of mues, even worse be- 
cause it showed up only after eighty 
years had passed. Once in a while 
a mu cat shows up, and we get called 
in, or one of the other few pro firms. 



We’re still dreading the day when 
these mues start to attack towns, 
or farmhouses. So far the only 
deaths were cattle. 

‘ Not counting Rodgers, of course. 

He was waiting for us at the 
landing strip behind the main com- 
plex of the farm and ranch; and it 
was clear from the first that he 
was the type who ran the show 
totally, disregarding any advice that 
went against it . winch it usual- 
ly did. I can’t really blame him, 
because he was totally starved for 
power. His father had left the ranch 
in the care of the foreman, and his 
son could never manage his own pro- 
perty. I knew the elder Rodgers 
slightly. He was fiercely possessive 
where his land was concerned, an 
anachronism from the times of the 
range wars, probably. He could have 
trained his son — but that involved 
risk to his land, or at least some 
uncertainty. 

None of us had ever seen Brad 
Rodgers in person before. We had 
dealt with his ranch only through 
his foreman, never with him. What 
he was holding over someone’s head 
now wo couldn’t guess, but it was 
obvious Who was in charge here. 

He was wearing a khaki shirt and 
light slacks, and he wasn’t built 
too badly, though compared to the 
three of us he was scrawny. He 
looked as if he was a commander 
briefing his troops, as he faced us 
in his study and pointed to a map 
of the spread. 

We had already been introduced, 
and he wanted to get down to busi- 
ness fast. The foremen were no- 
where in sight. A hired hand had 



MU PANTHER » 



123 




guided our airboat in to the strip, 
amd the heliport had been open 
when we landed. 

He pointed to a spot on the map 
about five miles from the house. 

“Here’s where the carcasses were 
found last night, gentlemen,” Rod- 
gers said. “Their throats were rip- 
ped out and large sections in their 
bodies had been torn up and eaten. 
One of my hands found the tracks 
not far from the steers, in some soft 
mud. All the area was tom up by the 
struggle between the steers and the 
cat. They were panther’s tracks, Mr. 
Everret.” 

He handed me a photograph of 
the tracks as a group and a plaster 
of Paris mold of one of them. There 
were five that were readable enough 
for this type of identification. They 
were panther’s, all right, and easily 
the sixteen inches that Rodgers had 
quoted. 

1 passed the photo and mold to 
Jesse; he confirmed the identifi- 
cation. This was a record cat, and 
the smeU of a great hunt was in the 
air, as miuoh as could filter over 
the atmosphere of fear induced by 
the thought of the huge panther, 
anyw'ay. 

‘^Uh, Mr. Rodgers,” Bill Craw- 
ford broke in, “could we speak to 
one of your foremen for the details 
of this, like the direction and the 
time factors involved? I mean — ” 
“Crawford, I run this ranch. As 
long as I do, you come to me for 
whatever information that you need. 
Remember that.” Rodgers was fum- 
ing mildly at the slight to his pride. 
I broke back in. 



“Mr. Rodgers, we know this is 
your land and we respect you. But 
we need an experienced hunter, 
someone who knows this area like 
the back ct his hand. Besides, we 
have only one extra seat and gun 
in the aiiboat. If we could, we’d 
be glad to take you out with us, 
but as it stands . .” 

“Everret, I’ve got my own guns. 
What are you using?” 

“Small aims are 8-gauge shot- 
guns fitted for rifled slugs and built 
for 45-gram explosive slugs.” I 
smiled in triumph; that beauty costs 
upwards of fourteen hundred dol- 
lars. But Rodgers was undaunted; 
he walked over to a rifle rack I 
hadn’t noticed and removed a twin 
to the express rifles outside, with a 
few extras: a gold inlay, suede 
cheekpiece and recoil pad and hand- 
carved fiberglass stock. Those would 
jack up the price considerably. Our 
own weapons were bare of these, 
because we all agreed that it is 
useless and costly. 

“You said yourself that you have 
an extra seat in the airboat, Everret. 
Well, Tm going to ibe in it, or else 
the whole deal is off. If I have to go 
to every Certified Professional Hunt- 
ing team in the country. I’ll see 
that cat brought down with my own 
eyes.” 

With that he brought us back out- 
side and vanished iback into the 
ranchhouse, leaving us to decide 
which was worse: hunting with a 
greenhorn or not hunting at all. 
Jesse and Bill were disgusted. 

‘^Barry, he can’t be serious. Rod- 
gers is probably safe only on a tar- 
get range — with small bores. Even 



124 



IF 




if he were a fairly good amateur 
hunter, this kind takes a special 
type of nerve. You know that. A 
mutated panther isn’t exactly an 
ordinary game.” 

Bill agreed with Jesse. 

“Any non-pros — and even some 
pros, I think — will do either one 
of two things. Either they would fold 
up like a sick jellyfish or they would 
empty their usually considerable 
armament into everything around — 
except the cat. And Rodgers looks 
like the amateur’s amateur, well 
equipped but Kelly green.” 

“I know it’s risky,” I said, “but 
it’s the only way we can get at that 
panther. We don’t want to pass that 
panther onto the Muller spread or 
Jerry Dane’s land to the east. We’ll 
have to put up with Rodgers until 
we get up. Then Tm the boss, as 
captain, or Jesse as co-pilot. Up 
there he can’t spit unless I let him.” 
“But, Barry, this is going to be 
tough work. We can’t afford any use- 
less weight till that cat is cold and 
cut up for the hogs.” 

“Sure, Jesse, I know. But we have 
to go after that cat. If it goes after 
a town or a ranchhouse because of 
a delay we caused, we can expect to 
have our license revoked by the 
Game Commission, at least.” 

So the issue was settled. But Rod- 
gers would have done better to stay 
beihind. When I said we were a 
professional team I didn’t mean 
that we were a bunch of jungle boys 
who go after the big cats with loin- 
cloths and knives. We cheat at this 
game — a lot. 

We have to. Nature made us what 
we are and in so doing fixed the 



odds at a thousand to one against us 
when faced with one of the mues. 
When we go after one of them — 
cougars, jaguars, panthers — we use 
custom airboats that can climb two 
hundred feet in a second, or skim 
over any surface at three hundred 
miles per hour. This isn’t too much 
speed in comparison to the big cats, 
but it’s the climbing power that 
is the big advantage, bringing us up 
and out of the range of the big- 
gest cat’s claws. 

We also carry sound pickups, 
radar and infrared scopes for track- 
ing and night work. And besides 
the small arms — ■ if you can call 
the 8-gauge shotguns “small” — we 
have an antitank recoilless rifle 
mounted on the rear of the airboat, 
Bill Crawford’s pride and joy. He 
can do everything with that piece 
but make love. Next to that and 
the crates of armorpiercing shells 
was a small ruby laser, designed for 
industrial cutting and welding. We’ve 
never had to use that beauty yet, 
but from the tests I’ve run I’d say 
it would be one hell of a barbecue. 
Bill has the laser and antitank gun 
controls hooked into a radar unit 
operating in unison with the unit up 
at the control panel. Unless one of 
us is at the guns, the radar aims 
and fires the weapon automatically. 
Of course, it’s keyed for animals 
only, just in case. 

J esse and I sat in the front of the 
airboat, with Bob in the artil- 
lery mount and Rodgers in the extra 
seat behind me. We unpacked the 
shotguns and loaded boxes filled 
with clips of the banana-sized shell. 



MU PANTHER 



125 




five to a clip. I charged the laser’s 
power supply and checked the liquid 
helium coolant bath surrounding the 
ruby shield and flash tubes. I set 
the beam for a pencil-thin “sheer” 
that can cut through a diamond like 
a knife through butter and settled 
the flashhead back into the mount. 

With that armory it might sound 
like we hunt fish in a barrel. Not 
quite. The mu cats can smell humans 
about a mile away, and four humans 
approach with ^ the subtlety of 
John Philip Sousa in his glory. 

Our usual tactic is to wait until 
radar tracking indicates that the cat 
has been stationary for some time 
and thus is probably sleeping. Then 
you move in and lob several ex- 
plosive shells into it and hope that 
you hit a vital spot. If you missed 
or, worse, only wounded the cat, the 
hunt becoimjes a good, old-fashioned 
chase. Quite often the roles of hunt- 
er and hunted are exchanged. Then 
you move iip high fast and hope 
to pick it off from above it. If not, 
there’s always the laser. 

One thing makes our team unique: 
Schultz. He’s a rare type of telepath, 
a visual empath combined with 
controlled clairvoyance. Through 
Schultz, I could scout a fifteen-mile 
area in a few minutes, not by radar 
but by direct vision. The actual em- 
pathy was limited to vision, but 
Schultz could project any other sense 
as well. I value that dog more than 
the radar and sound amplifiers to- 
gether. 

Schultz is slightly larger than most 
German Shepherds, due both to 
champion parents and the radio- 
genetic treatment that turned him 



into a mued esper. He weighs about 
one himdred fifty pounds, all solid 
muscle, and stands up to my waist 
— and I’m not exactly tiny. His coat 
is a mixture of tan and brown fur, 
short and bristly. His face and head 
are typical, with the squared-off 
muzzle and blunt forehead. 

R odgers gave us the location of 
the original killings, and we 
VTO’d to about fifty feet and shot 
northeast at an easy 150. The vio- 
lent blast of the air from the fans 
quieted down to a low whine under 
the hull as the automatics cut in. 

The dead steers were visible from 
a good distance away. I set the air- 
boat down a few yards away from 
the carcasses. They had been dead 
for about twelve hours in the sun 
and were beginning to decay. But 
most of the massive bulk was still 
warm. One of the gargantuan slobs 
of 'beef that had been gor^ from 
their bellies would have filled the 
panther, but the four were each 
gorged slightly, just enough to fill 
the stomach of the cat. This was a 
killer, the worst kind of mu. 

We examined the tracks in the 
soft clay; the fight had crushed the 
grass down into a soft pulp and 
turned the soil. The tracks were 
panther’s, a complete single set. I 
wanted Shultz to see this. 

SchultZi come here, boy, I called 
to him. 

What, Barry-man? He jumped 
from the airboat and trott^ over 
to me. 

Sniff the tracks. It only took him 
a moment. 

Panther, Very big one. 



126 



IF 




He looked up at me, with a gleam 
in his eye. He sensed the brutality of 
the killings, and he wanted that 
panther now. When you train an 
ordinary dog to hunt, he develops 
a reflex. But Schultz is more than 
a dog; he can sense emotioils and 
motives and has a deep sense of 
justice. Maybe revenge would be a 
better word, but it’s all the same 
thing in practice. 

We started moving outward in a 
spiral pattern. We didn’t have any 
dues as to which direction the pan- 
ther had taken, and the spiral would 
cover all directions very thoroughly. 
It was six o’clock now, and the sun 
was almost down. Jesse watched the 
radar anxiously as Bill fiddled with 
the controls on the antitank gun. 
Rodgers was fidgeting with his 8- 
gauge, running his fingers over the 
carved receiver lovingly. He 
handled it as if he was familiar with 
it. A novice would be clumsy with 
the heavy gun, but he appeared to 
know the feel of it well. That was 
some relief, anyway; a good shot 
mi^t come in handy. But he would 
be more trouble than he was worth 
if he didn’t stay put and keep out 
of our way. 

He didn’t look too bad, for an 
amateur; he was heavily buht, for 
his weight, and not too much of 
him was fat. Maybe he would be 
useful. But maybe I’m just a per- 
petual optimist. 

I turned to Jesse, “Anything 
yet?” 

“Not a thing, Barry. It’s getting 
dark, too. Better fit the sniperscopes 
onto the 8-gauges.” 

“Sure thing, Jesse.” I snapped 



the intercom on and signaled Bill 
to bring the infrared assemblies down 
from the mount and teach Rodgers 
how to use one. 

After a moment he climbed down 
from the mount and set a box of 
Farnsworth ’scopes down next to 
Rodgers. He unpacked one, snapped 
it into a magnetic Bushnell mount 
and slipped it onto the grooved re- 
ceiver of his shotgun. He slid the 
power supply and infrared source 
onto the gun and checked to see 
if the balance wasn’t disturbed too 
much. It wasn’t. He switched the 
cadmium cell on and gazed into the 
image tube; in a few seconds the 
image cleared and the infrared waves 
illuminated the ground below. He 
clicked it off. 

“Think you can put that sniper- 
scope together, Mr. Rodgers?” Bill’s 
tone was level; that meant only that 
he was annoyed. 

“I can try. I’ve fooled around with 
telescopic sights before. Thirty-X 
Weavers, mostly.” 

“Really?” The slightest bit of sar- 
casm dripped through this time. Bill 
is a confirmed C 3 mic, and we’re 
used to it, but Rodgers wasn’t. 

Rodgers snapped the tube onto 
his mount and correctly placed it 
on the receiver. He glanced back 
at Bill’s gun and snapped the rest 
of the assembly on. Then he flipped 
the switch. 

I heard a crack and whirled. Rod- 
gers had flinched and dropped 
the gun. Bill dived for it and caught 
the magazine soon enough to pre- 
vent the ’scope from being smashed 
on the airboat floor. 



MU PANTHER

“You son of a Gila monster,” he 
snapped quietly, “that’s a five hun- 
dred dolW instrument! You revers- 
ed the pdarity and got hit by 4500 
volts. You’re lucky you didn’t fry. 
Next time check the wiring, okay?” 
Bill walked back up to the gun 
mount and left Rodgers sligbtly con- 
fused and with a bruised ego. Jesse 
and I returned to our controls. After 
a few minutes I glanced back at our 
employer; he was slouched in his 
seat, an expression on his face as 
plain as a neon sign. 

If so much as a grasshopper 
moved down ibelow, he’d empty five 
slugs into it as fast as he could 
squeeze them off. I set the controls 
on automatic and turned around to 
speak to him. 

“Rodgers,” I said, “I know you 
hired us. On your land you’re the 
boss. But up hete I call the shots. 

“When we spot the panther, let 
Crawford handle it. We’re going 
to approach the cat while it sleeps 
and we’ll lay an artillery shell into 
its head from five hundred yards. 
If you start popping off slu^ from 
the shotgun at that range you’ll 
accomplish two things: waste am- 
munition and wake up the panther. 
If you’ve ever seen thirty^five feet 
of black, muscled hell jump seventy 
feet into the air straight at you, 
you’d realize why we like to be 
nice and sneaky about it.” 

Evidently Rodgers was still nurs- 
ing the bruise on his ego. 

“Everret, what d’you think I am? 
Some kind of fool? I won’t crack 
up. I want that panther.” 

I could plainly see that I’d had 
no effect at all on him. I just sat 



back and (hoped that Bill’s first shot 
would score before Rodgers started 
blasting away. 

About twenty minutes later Jesse 
turned to me. 

“Barry, I’ve got a blip on the 
screen. Stationary. Right size and 
shape.” 

“What’s the relative position to 
us,” r almost shouted. It was north- 
east, about two o’clock. 

“Want to try an approach, Bar- 
ry,” Jesse asked. 

“Not yet. I’m going to let Schultz 
take me out there.” 

“Good hunting.” As soon as I 
had thought his name, Schultz stood 
up and walked over to me. 

Good boy, Schultzie, Ready for 
a trip? 

Sure, Barry-man, Where do you 
want to see? 

I checked the range on Jesse’s 
scope; 800 yards to the northeast. 
Now, okay. 

He brought me out there, eight 
hundred yards from the airboat. The 
controls were still on auto. I felt my- 
self go limp and my eyes close as I 
went into empathy. 

The effect is like a zoom camera 
with you inside. 

It was the panther, all right. I 
could see it perfectly, two hundred 
yards away, through the low, wide 
angle of the dog’s mental eyes. 
Strange, no one’s ever gotten an em- 
path animal to project the master’s 
eyes out there; they can only send 
out their own eye and hook you in 
on what they see. 

The cat was sleeping, digesting 
the rich beef from the steers, I 
guessed. The body symmetry was 



128 



IF 




perfect, not deformed like many 
natural mues. It was every inch of 
the thirty-five feet, and more. The 
sleek, black hide stretched out glist- 
ening like a living sphinx, cold as 
ebony and as hard. 

Suddenly I felt a great heaving 
sensation, and my thoughts were 
tom from the cat with sickening 
force. Pain seared my mind, my 
eyes; my entire head ached with a 
deep, continuous throb. My vision 
was cut off; for several seconds I 
was totally blinded. The pain spread 
slowly down my neck and my face 
muscles cramped into a grimace. Fax 
away, I heard Schultz yelping. 

I opened my eyes, my real ones, 
and saw Rodgers standing over 
me, shaking my arm, and Jesse com- 
ing toward us with blood in his 
eyes. Schultz was whimpering at 
my feet. 

Rodgers had broken the empath- 
etic coupling, a painful experience 
for both Schultz and me. I picked 
Schultz up and put him in my lap, 
trying to soothe his body and mind, 
in him in very precarious balance. 
It had been laid bare as if a steel 
rasp had ibeen drawn across it. 

“You double-dyed son of a sand 
lizard!” Jesse snapped out at Rod- 
gers. “You broke empathy between 
Barry and the dog! They were in 
mental coupling, and you forcibly 
cut it off. You might have ruined 
his mind, as well as the dog’s.” 
Rodgers was almost cowering. I 
would have, with Jesse looking as 
if he were out for blood. 

“I didn’t know,” he croaked. “I 
saw the airboat go on hover and 



Everret slump down in his seat. 1 
thought he was sick.” 

“Sit down and shut up, Rodgers! 
And stay theie until we’re back at 
your ranchhouse,” 1 roared at him, 
fighting down an enormous head- 
ache. Rodgers fell back into the seat 
as if he had been pushed. He was 
licking his self-respect for a third 
time. Poor old guy, I thought. He 
gets pushed around down there, on 
his own property, and he gets push- 
ed around up here, by the men he 
hired. Well, we coul^’t afford to 
have somebody cutting up in the 
aiiboat. Once we got back down I 
would recommend a good analyst. 

Then I remembered what I’d seen 
out there. 

“Jesse, that’s the panther out 
there all right. It’s asleep there now. 
Keep an eye on the radar image. 
If it so much as blinks sing out 
loud. Bill, d’you hear that?” I’d cut 
the intercom in previously. In an- 
swer, 1 heard the automatic guidance 
mechanism in, for the laser and the 
antitank gun, and the slow whine and 
crackle of the storage capacities 
filled the cabin. Ozone soon be- 
came noticeable; each of the forty 
capacitors had a capacity of 3000 
millifarads. 

“Bill, when I give the word, fire 
the armor-piercer into the cat. Set 
it on ten-second delayed action so 
I can get out there with Schultz 
in time.” 

“All set up here, Barry, the 
intercom buzzed. I drove the boat 
in to five hundred yards and then 
set hex down easy on the hard 
ground. The muzzle of the antitank 
gun swung up a few degrees as the

controls locked into the radar. Bill 
adjusted for windage after he con- 
sulted a portable anemometer built 
into the mouht. 

“Mark,” I said. Up in the con- 
trol room, Bill started the timer. 

Schultz, I thought softly, how are 
you feeling? 

All right, Barry -man. Head still 
hurt a little. He sounded weak. 

That*s okay, Schultz, so does mine. 
How about another trip? 

Just a short one, Barry-man. Need 
rest. 

. eight . nine . ten . 
fire . plus one.” The timer lights 
on both panels blinked patterns. 
Then I was back looking at the 
panther. 

In the back of my mind I heard 
the muffled roar of the gun and felt 
the shock pass through the springs 
of the absorbers and diminish to 
nothing. The link was weak, and 
the panther was faint and blurry in 
Schultz’s mind. But I saw it sud- 
denly awaken and leap out of the 
way, just as the flash of the ex- 
plosion shot through my mind and 
Schultz’s. 

A miss. 

1 pulled myself back to the air- 
boat. Rodgers had started yell- 
ing in triumph, expecting a chorus. 
Finding himself quite alone, he died 
out fast. Jesse and I were watching 
the radar intently, as was Bill in the 
mount up above. The blip was mov- 
ing fast and toward the center of 
the screen. Toward us. 

I rammed the fans into high and 
climibed to three hundred feet as 
fast as it would move. The panther 



was already visible and closing fast, 
a black strip streaking through the 
low grass and brush. 

“It dodged that shell without 
blinking twice,” Jesse snorted. He 
clicked off the safety of the 8-gauge. 
I shook my head. 

“Hold it, Jesse. And Bill, don’t 
cut the laser loose. We’ll let it tire 
itself out jumping at us, and then 
we’ll tail it until it drops. We’ll 
finisih it off.” 

The panther was much closer 
now; its movements were plain. It 
was coming in at about four hundred 
miles an hour and was about one 
hundred yards away. In a fraction of 
a second it was under us, leaping. 

It reached halfway to us, a 
hundred and fifty feet. You might 
call that a record of some kind, 
but at the time I didn’t notice that. 
Rodgers, who had been frozen since 
the miss, suddenly leaped to the side 
of the airboat and fired the five 
shots in his shotgun at the cat. 

It touched ground as the last shot 
rang out and bounded off with a 
roar of pain and rage that shook 
the airboat like a toy boat in a hur- 
ricane. I’d expected Rodgers to 
crack, but I was surprised at his 
skill. Three of the slugs hit home. 
They must have lodged in the thighs 
or low in the shoulders, because the 
cat moved away at about two hun- 
dred MPH. This was slow enough 
for the airboat to tail, luckily 
enough. Still, this wouldn’t stop 
Jesse from giving Rodgers a pretty 
bad time. 

I glanced back at the spare seat. 
Jesse had grabbed Rodgers by the 
collar and hoisted him up from 



130 



IF 




where he had fallen after the cat’s 
roar. He had pulled the rancher uip 
to face level, so that Rodger’s feet 
dangled a few inches from the deck 
plate. He stared into Rodgers’s eyes 
for a moment, then lowered him 
back to his seat. When Jesse looks 
at anyone that way, words are in- 
adequate. At least printable words 
are. 

I checked the radar once more 
and found that the cat had raced 
ailmost out of range of the screen. 
L cut the automatic pilot in, to 
follow the panther at half a mile, 
with steady compensation for in- 
creases and decreases in the speed. 
I didn’t want that cat to turn and 
fight until it was dead tired, and 
if we moved in any closer than five 
hundred yards it would probably do 
just that. So we would patiently 
keep up with the animal and kill 
it when it couldn’t fight back. 

I didn’t blame Jesse one bit for 
humiliatinig Rodgers, but I wanted to 
clarify a few things with him be- 
fore he decided not to pay our bills 
after the hunt was over. 

“I told you we couldn’t afford any 
trigger-happy idiots on this trip, Mr. 
Rodgers. It makes no difference that 
you’re a crack shot. That panther 
is potentially dangerous to neigh- 
boring communities, and if he gets 
past us the responsibility is on your 
head. But until we’re through, you’re 
going to stay put. The only reason 
we’re not taking you back to your 
ranchhouse now is that we can’t 
spare the time.” 

He stood up and faced me. So 
now he was going to make his stand, 
I thought. 



“Everret, you seem to forget who 
hired you. As long as I employ you, 
I do what I want. And if you think 
that I’m gomig <to let myself be 
pushed around because I shot at the 
beast, you’re crazy. I want that 
panther dead and its head above 
my mantle.” 

H is voice was arrogant, and if 
he had omitted that last sen- 
tence I might have slugged him. Not 
only would Rodgers fail even to 
come close to bagging that game 
himself, but mu game is considered 
varmint game. A mu trophy was 
a little out of taste, like stuffing 
and mounting a tomcat, only on a 
larger scale. 

“Rodgers, that head goes to no- 
body. Even if you earned it — and 
you won’t — the corpse will be 
vaporized by a wide-angle laser. If 
you want a trophy, hire a guide to 
take you out and find a good-sized 
mu bear. But I won’t give you a 
panther. Anyway, all you accom- 
plished with the 8-gauge was to give 
us three times the work in killing 
that panther. You might as well have 
injected it with a kilo of adrenalin.” 
“What work? Just turn the laser 
on that cat.” His stupidity was amaz- 
ing. 

“Look, Mr, Rodgers, that laser 
is for use at point-blank range and 
at that, only for emergencies. If I 
used it and missed, the beam would 
keep on going. They’ve bounced 
weaker ones than that off the moon, 
and with small relative divergence. 
If that laser tore through a town, 
it would make the Chicago fire look 
like a marshmallow-roast.” 



MU PANTHER

I turned away and checked the 
radar. The panther had dowed down 
to a himdired miles per hour al- 
ready. It seemed to be slightly tir- 
ing. I hoped. 

We kept up the chase for an- 
other six hours. Jesse and Crawford 
were standing radar watch while I 
dozed. Rodgers was out like a light. 

The next thing I knew, Jesse was 
shaking me roughly* 

“It’s stopped, Barry, We’re still 
a mile from it; I pulled back the 
extra five htmdred yards when I 
saw its pace falter and halt. We’re 
hovering now, in the clear.” 

The intercom was already on. 
‘^What do you think. Bill?” I asked. 
“Want to try to move in and drop 
a shell from close range or stay 
back and pick it o^ from here?“ 

“I’d move in, Barry,” replied Bill. 
“That cat is half-dead, and we’ve 
got the speed on it. Closer, I’d have 
a better chance of getting a good 
one in, and the cat would have less 
time to dodge.” 

“Same here, Barry,” Jesse said. 
“Wait any longer, and the cat might 
rest up enough to put on a fresh 
bit of speed and get away. But now 
we’ve got him.” 

I felt the same way; I gunned 
the fans forward, and moved in 
a quarter of a mile closer. No 
movement on the screen. We moved 
in the other quarter mile, and there 
was still no sign of life from the 
blip. So far, so good. 

I noticed Schultz at my feet; he 
seemed nervous. I called to him. 

Whafs wrong, Schultz? 

Wrong way, Barry-man, Cat not 
there. 



What? Are you saying it*s dead? 
No, Cat behind us. 

T his confused me. I checked the 
radar and pressed the system- 
check button. It was functioning 
perfectly. I projected a mental ca- 
ress to the dog, and silently cursed 
Rodgers for ruining Schultz’s mind. 

We were about a hundred yards 
from the panther now; through the 
infrared sight it was visible plainly, 
a igiant thing, breathing fast and 
labored. 

The intercom buzzed on. It was 
BiU. 

“Barry, something’s wrong >w7th 
the laser auto control. It’s faced 
180 degrees to the south, directly 
away from the target.” 

I told him to run a circuit check, 
switch to manual control and junk 
the auto imtil we returned to the 
hanger in Denver. 

“When you’re finished with the 
laser controls,” I told him, “get 
a fix on the panther and lob a 
shell in.” 

He aimed and gave a ten-second 
warning. Jesse and I were glued to 
the radar. The gun fired, and the 
shell exploded directly on target; 
through the sniperscopes we could 
see the corpse. The head was blown 
off. 

Then there was a new blip on 
the screen. I flipped a spotlight on 
and saw Rodgers running toward the 
oat. 

The next few seconds went by 
very, very fast. I saw the panther’s 
body waver and disappear and 
stood gawking as Rodgers turned, 



132 



IF 




puzzled, then froze in terror. He 
raised the S^gauge and fired, but he 
didn’t have enough time to get off 
a second shot. He was smart enough 
to realize that aiming over a million- 
candlepower beacon was impossible; 
he shielded his face and threw the 
gun down, turned and ran. A long 
shadow engulfed the airboat, and 
the black panther leaped over us at 
Rodgers. He had time for only one 
scream. 

The panther turned back toward 
us; then I saw the laser’s ruby tube 
swing down fast at the thing in front 
of us and come alive with scarlet 
brilliance. Bill twisted it upwards 
in a long slash as the cat jumped 
once more, and the beam charred 
a long, disemboweling slash that 
clove the panther from head to 
loins. It fell in front of the boat, 
almost crushing us. 

Jesse and I dismounted and ran 
in front of the burnt corpse. The 
slit eyes stared at us still, carry- 
ing a message of agony and hate. 
I leveled my shotgun and fired point- 



blank into the left eye and heard 
the answering explosion that shat- 
tered the skull. 

I t was a perfect natural defense 
for a hunted animal. Like 
Schultz, the panther could project 
sensory images into our minds, but 
in this cat the images could be 
controlled. It showed us non- 
existent blips on the radar and false 
visual images. 

That’s why the laser autocontrol 
seemed haywire. It was following 
the real panther. And Schultz 
couldn’t be fooled by the mental 
broadcasts, any more than we could 
be fooled by someone whispering 
into our ears. Schultz must have 
felt like a two-year-old child trying 
to warn its parents of a burglar. It 
could attract their attention but 
couldn’t communicate. 

Anyway, that’s the only mu so far 
with this type of power. Possibly 
the first of many, though. If so, 
it’ll be a long season for us. 

And for Schultz. END

SYNOPSIS 



Illustrated by Morrow 



B aines, president of Consoli- 
dated Warfare Service, the mu- 
nitions subsidiary of an interna- 
tional chemical and dye cartel, has 
applied to THERON WARE, a black 
magician of the highest repute, for 
a demonstration of his abilities. Ac- 
companied by his executive assistant, 
JACK GINSBERG, a thorough-go- 
ing skeptic, he visits Ware*s rented 
palazzo in the Italian resort town of 
Positano, where Ware provides a 
minor exhibition of alchemy, chang- 
ing two tears successively into blood, 
gold and lead under controlled cir- 
cumstances, - 



This does not satisfy Baines, who 
has something much bigger in mind. 
Ware warns him that all magic, re- 
gardless of degree, is based upon 
the invocation of angels or demons 
— mostly the latter — and that it is 
expensive, dangerous and difficult, 
Baines already knows this from an 
earlier visit to Monte Albano, a 
sanctuary of white magicians. Strict- 
ly as a further test, Baines com- 
missions Ware to procure by magic 
the death of the current Governor 
of California, Ware agrees, Gins- 
berg, a man of slightly odd tastes, 
is intrigued by Ware's obvious con-

ALEPH - NULL 



fidence and, in a private interview, 
attempts to ask a favor of the ma- 
gician, but doesn't succeed in spe- 
cifying what it is. Ware offers him 
the use of a succubus, but is re- 
fused. 

At Monte Albano, the white ma- 
gicians have divined something of 
the nature of Baines's forthcoming 
major commission and have reason 
to believe it may be a major disaster 
for the whole world. Under the 
terms of the Grand Covenant, under 
which all magic operates, they are 
entitled to impose upon Ware . a 
white magician as an observer, pro- 
viding that the white magician does 
not interfere in any way with Ware's 
operation. They choose FATHER 
DOMENICO, a suitably skilled and 
blameless man, who does not relish 
the assignment. 

In the meantime, Baines, who has 
returned to Rome, receives news of 
the death of the Governor of Cali- 
fornia, as specified. He decides to 
return to Positano, taking with him 
this time not only Jack Ginsberg, 
but also a scientist of his firm, DR. 
ADOLPH HESS, also as an ob- 
server. 

Thanks to various delays en route, 
Baines, Ginsberg, Hess and Fr. Do- 
menico all arrive for the next in- 
vocation of Hell at the same time 
— during the Christmas season. 

Baines's second commission is a 
further test, this time the death of 
an eminent theoretical physicist with 

135 



no known enemies, Ware^ agrees and 
also consents to allow Baines's party 
to watch the process of invokiitig 
the demon involved; he bars Fr, 
Domenico, however. The monk sub- 
sequently divines that this in any 
case is not the major disaster he has 
been sent to observe. 

Prior to the experiment. Ware 
shows Hess, in whom he sees a po- 
tential ally, his laboratory and ap- 
paratus and explains to him some 
of the theory of magic. Hess is un- 
willingly impressed. 

Before the group, Ware then con- 
jures up a demon named MAR- 
CHOSIAS, one of many with wham 
he has pacts, to tempt and destroy 
the next victim. It is a fearful pro- 
cess and leaves nobody in any doubt 
that Ware is exactly what he says 
he is. 

Then all must wait for the send- 
ing to take effect. During this per- 
iod, Jack Ginsberg succeeds in ex- 
pressing to Ware what it is that he 
wants: He would like to learn the 
Art. Ware', who by now has realized 
that Baines's next assignment will be 
so huge that he must have assistants, 
says he will consider this if Jack 
will first sample the banquet he 
thinks he wants. At Ginsberg's as- 
sent, Ware does send him the pre- 
viously profferred succubus, Jack is 
both revolted and captured — that 
is, he becomes addicted. 

The victim of MARCHOSIAS 
duly dies, and Baines reveab at last 




what has been at the back of his 
mind all the time: 

'7 would like to let all the major 
demons out of Hell for one night, 
turn them loose in the world with 
no orders and no restrictions, and 
see just what it is they would do 
if they were left on their own hooks 
like that.*' 

Ware consents, but this time asks 
Fr. Domenico to be present at the 
ceremony, in case it should get out 
of control. Fr. Domenico must 
agree, but points out that it would 
be safer if he could call together a 
whole convocation of white magi- 
cians at Monte Albano, to stand 
by in case of disaster. Ware on re- 
flection decides that this is a wise 
precaution and assents. 

Because of the time needed for 
preparatioyis, and for Fr. Domenico's 
trip, the experiment is scheduled for 
Easter. 

XIV 

T^ather Domenico found getting 
north to Monte Albano a rela- 
tively easy journey despite all the 
snow; he was able to take the rapido 
most of the way. Absurdly, he found 
himseif worrying about the snow. If 
it lasted, there would be devastating 
floods in the spring. But that was 
not the only affliction the spring had 
in store. 

After the journey, nothing seemed 
to go right. Only about half of the 
world’s white magicians, a small 
number in any case, who had been 
summoned to the convocation had 
been able to make it, or had thought 
it worth the trip. One of the greatest. 



the aged archivist Fr. Bonfiglioli, 
had come all the way from Cam- 
bridge only to find the rigors of 
being portaged up the Mount too 
much for him. He was now in the 
hospital at the base of the Mount 
with a coronary infarct, and the 
prognosis was said to be poor. 

Luckily, Fr. Uccello had been able 
to come. So had Fr. Monteith, a 
venerable master of a great horde 
of creative (though often ineffec- 
tual) spirits of the cislunar sphere; 
Fr. Boucher, w(ho had commerce 
with some intellect of the recent 
past which was neither a mortal nor 
a Power, a commerce bearing all 
the earmarks of necromancy and 
yet not; Fr. Vance, in whose mind 
floated visions of magics which 
would not be comprehensible, let 
alone practicable, for millions of 
years to come! Fr. Anson, a brusque 
engineer-type who specialized in un- 
clouding the minds of politicians; 
Fr. Selahny, a terrifying Kabbalist 
who spoke in parables and of whom 
it was said that no one since Levia- 
than had understood his counsel; 
Fr. Rosenblum, a dour, bearlike 
man who tersely predicted disasters 
and was always right about them; 
Fr. Atheling, a well-eyed grimorian 
who saw portents in parts of speech 
and lectured everyone in a tense 
nasal voice until the Director had 
to exile him to the library except 
when business was being conducted; 
and a gaggle of lesser men and 
their apprentices. 

These and the brothers of the 
Order gathered in the chapel of the 
monastery to discuss what might be 
done. There was no agreement from 



136 



IF 




the outset. Fr. Boucher was of the 
firm opinion that Ware would not 
be permitted to work any such 
conjuration on Easter and that, 
hence, only minor precautions were 
necessary. Fr. Domenico had to 
point out that Ware’s previous send- 
ing — a comparatively minor one 
to be sure, but what was that say- 
ing about the fall of the sparrow? 
— had been made without a sign of 
Divine intervention upon Christmas 
Eve. 

Then there was the problem of 
whether or not to try to mobilize 
the Oedestiai Princes and their sub- 
ordinates. Fr. Atheling would have 
it that just putting these Princes on 
notice might provoke action against 
Ware, since there was no predicting 
what They might do, and hence 
would be in violation of the Cov- 
enant. He was finally olitshouted 
by Frs. Anson and Vance, with the 
obvious but not necessarily valid 
argument that the Princes must 
know all about the matter anyhow. 

How shaky that assumption was 
was revealed that night, when those 
bright angels were summoned one 
by one before the convocation for 
a council of war. Bright, terrible 
and enigmatic They were at any 
time, but at this calling They were 
in a state of spirit beyond the un- 
derstanding of any of the masters 
present in the chapel. Aratron, 
chiefest of Them all, appeared to be 
indeed imaware of the forthcom- 
ing unleashing and disappeared with 
a roar when it was described. 
Phaleg, most military of spirits, 
seemed to know of Ware’s plans, 
but would not discuss them and 



also vanished when pressed. Opheil 
the mercurial, too, was preoccupied, 
as though Ware’s plotting were only 
a neghgihle distraction from some 
immensely greater thought. His an- 
swers grew shorter and shorter, and 
He finally lapsed into what, in a 
mortal, Fr. Domenico would have 
unhesitatingly called surliness. Fin- 
ally — although not intended as 
final, for the convocation had meant 
to consult all seven of the Olym- 
pians — the water-spirit Phul when 
called up appeared fearsomely with- 
out a head, rendering converse im- 
possible and throwing the chapel 
into a perilous uproar. 

“These are not good omens,” Fr. 
Atheling said; and for the first 
time in his life, everyone agreed 
with him. It was agreed, also, that 
everyone but Fr. Domenico would 
remain at the Mount through the 
target day, to take whatever steps 
then appeared to be necessary; but 
there was precious little hope that 
they would be effective. Whatever 
was going on in Heaven, it ap- 
peared to leave small concern to 
spare for pleas from Monte Albano. 

Father Domenico went south 
again far earlier than he had 
planned, unable to think of any- 
thing but the mystery of that final, 
decapitate apparition. The ileaden 
skies returned him no answer. 

XV 

O n that penultimate morning, 
Theron Ware faced the final 
choice of which demons to call 
up, and for this he needed to re- 
pair to his laboratory, to check the 



FAUST ALEPH-NULL 



137 




book of pacts. Otherwise his prepar- 
ations were all made. He had per- 
formed the blood sacrifices the pre- 
vious evening and then had com- 
pletely rearranged the furniture in 
the workroom to accommodate the 
Grand Circle — the first time he 
had had need of it in twenty years 

— the Lesser Circles and the Gate- 
way. There were even special prep- 
arations for Fr. Domenico — who 
had returned early and with a grat- 
ifyingly troubled countenance — 
should it become necessary to ask 
the monk to call for Divine inter- 
vention; but Ware was tolerably 
sure it would not be. Though he 
had never attempted anything of 
this magnitude before, he felt the 
work in his fingertips, like a well 
practiced sonata. 

He was, however, astonished and 
disqmeted to find Dr. Hess already 
in the laboratory — not only be- 
cause of the potentialities for con- 
tamination, but at the inevitable 
conclusion that Hess had worked 
out how to placate the Guardian of 
the door. This man evidently was 
even more dangerous than Ware 
had guessed. 

“Do you want to ruin us all?” 
Ware demanded. 

Hess turned away from the Cir- 
cle he had been inspecting and 
looked at Ware frankly. He was pale 
and hollow-eyed; not only had the 
fasting been hard on his spare 
frame — that was a hazard every 
neophyte had to come to terms with 

— but apparently he had not been 
sleeping much, either. He said at 
once: 

“No indeed. My apologies. Dr. 



Ware. My curiosity overcame me, 
I’m afraid.*’ 

“You didn’t touch anything, P 
hope?” 

“Certainly not. I took your warn- 
ings about that with great serious- 
ness, I assure you.” 

“Well . probably no harm 
done, then. I can sympathize with 
your interest and even approve it, 
in part. But I’ll be instructing you 
all in detail a little later today, and 
then you’ll have ample time to 
inspect the arrangements; I do want 
you to know them intimately. But 
right now I still have some addi- 
tional work to do, so if you don’t 
mind. .” 

“Quite.” Hess moved obediently 
toward the door. As he was about 
to touch the handle. Ware added: 
“By the way, Dr. Hess: how did 
you deceive the Guardian?” 

Hess made no pretense of being 
puzzled by the question. “With a 
white pigeon and a pocket mirror 
I got from Jack.” 

“Hmm. Do you know, that would 
never have occurred to me; these 
pagan survivals are mostly a waste 
of effort. Let’s talk about it more, 
later; you may have something to 
teach me.” 

Hess made a small bow and fin- 
ished his departure. Forgetting him 
instantly. Ware stared at the Grand 
Circle for a moment and then walk- 
ed around it clockwise to the lec- 
tern and unlocked the book of 
pacts. The stiff pages bent reassur- 
ingly in his hands. Each leaf was 
headed by the character or sign of 
a demon; below, in the special ink 
reserved for such matters — gall,

copperas, gum arabic — was the 
text of Theron Waie’s agreement 
with that entity, signed at the bot- 
tom hy Ware in his own blood and 
by the character of the demon re- 
peated in its own hand. Leading all 
the rest was the seal, and also the 
characters, of Lucifuge Rofocale, 
which also appeared on the book’s 
cover. 





There then followed eighty-nine 
others. It was Ware’s sober belief, 
backed by infernal assurances he 
had reason to trust, that no previous 
magician had held so many spirits 
in thrall. After forty years, true, 
all the names would change, and 
Ware would have to force the re- 
execution of each pact, and so, 
again and again through the five 
hundred years of life he had bought 



from Hagith in his salad days as 
a white magician. Nevertheless it 
could be said that in the possession 
of this book. Ware was at least 
potentially the wealthiest mortal in 
all of (history, though to anyone else 
in the world the book would be 
worth nothing except as a curiosum. 

These spirits, not counting Luci- 
fuge Rofocale, comprised the sev- 
enteen mfemal archangels of the 
Grand Grimoire and the sevenity- 
two demons of the Descending 
Hierarchy once confined in the 
brazen vessel of Solomon the King: 
a fabulous haul indeed, and each 
captive commanding troops and 
armies of lesser spirits and 
souls by the thousands of millions, 
more of them every minute (for 
these days, virtually everyone was 
damned; it had been this disoofvery 
which had first convinced Ware 
that the Rebellion was in faot go- 
ing to succeed, probably by the 
year 2000 A.D.; the many plain 
symptoms of chiliastic panic almdy 
being manifested amongst the laity 
were almost certainly due to be 
vindicated, for everyone was rush- 
ing incontinently into Hell^mouth 
without even the excuse of an Anti- 
Christ to mislead him. As matters 
stood now, Christ Himself would 
have to creep stealthily, hoping to 
be ignored, even into a cathedral to 
conduct a Mass, as in that panel 
of Hieronymus Bosch; the number 
of people who could not pronounce 
the Divine Name without a betray- 
ing stammer — or their own names, 
for that matter — had grown from 
a torrent to a deluge, and ridiculous- 
ly, hardly any of them were claiming

any fraction of the possible profits 
in this world. They did not even 
know that they were on the win- 
ning side, or even that there was 
more than one side. No wonder 
Ware had found so much fat in the 
cauldron, waiting to be skimmed.) 

But as Ware had already warned 
Baines, not all the spirits in the 
book were suitable for the experi- 
ment at hand. There were some like 
Marchosias, who hoped after an 
interval to be returned to the Celes- 
tial choirs. In this hope. Ware was 
grimly certain, they were mistaken, 
and the only reward they would 
receive would be from the Emperor 
of the Pit, that kind of reward 
customarily given to fair-weather 
friends and summer soldiers. In the 
meantime, the evils they could be 
persuaded or compelled to do were 
minor and hardly worth the effort 
of invoking them. One, whom Ware 
had already mentioned to Baines, 
Vassago, was even said in the Lesser 
Key and elsewhere to be “good by 
nature” — not too trustworthy an 
ascription — and indeed was some- 
times called upon by white magi- 
cians. Others in the hierarchy, like 
Phoenix, controlled aspects of real- 
ity which were of little relevance 
to Baines’s commission. , 

Taking up the pen of the Art, 
Ware made a list. When he was 
finished, he had written down for- 
ty-eight names. Considering the 
number of the Fallen, that was 
not a large muster; but he thought 
it would serve the purpose. He clos- 
ed and locked the book and, after 
a pause to rebuke and torment the 
Guardian of his door, went out into 



the Easter morning to rehearse his 
Tanists. 

N o day, it seemed, had ever gone 
so slowly for Baines as this 
Easter, despite the diversion of the 
rehearsal; but at last it was night 
and over, and Ware pronounced 
himself ready to begin. 

The Grand Circle now on the 
parquetry of the refectory bore a 
generic resemblance to the circle 
Ware had composed on Christmas 
Eve, but it was a great deal big- 
ger and much different in de- 
tail. The circle proper was made 
of strips of the skin of the sacri- 
ficial kid, with the hair still on it, 
fastened to the floor at the cardinal 
points with four naUs which. Ware 
had explained, had been drawn from 
the coffin of a child. On the north- 
east arc, under the word BERKA- 
lAL, there rested the strips the body 
of a male bat which had been 
drowned in blood; on the north- 
east, under the word AMASARAC, 
the skull of a parricide; on the 
southwest, under the word ASARA- 
DEL, ’the horns of a goat; and on 
the southwest, under the word ARI- 
BECL, sat Ware’s cat, to the secret 
of whose diet they were now all 
privy. (Indeed, there had not been 
much of moment to the rehearsal, 
and Baines had inferred that its 
chief object had been to impart 
to the rest of them such items of 
unpleasant knowledge as this.) 

The triangle had been drawn in- 
side the circle with a lump of hae- 
matite or lodestone. Under its base 
was drawn a figure consisting of a 
chi and a rho superimposed, resting 



140 



IF 




on the line, with a cross to each 
side of it. Flanking the other two 
qides were the great candles of 
virgin wax, each stick sitting in 
the center of a crown of vervain- 
Three circles for the operators — 
Ware, Baines and Hess; Jack Gins- 
berg and Fr. Domenico would stand 
outside, in separate pentacles — 
were inside the triangle, connected 
by a cross; the northern circle had 
drawn horns on it. At the pinnacle 
of the triangle sat a new brazier, 
loaded with newly consecrated char- 
coal. To the left side of the horned 
circle, which was to be Ware’s, 
of course, was the lectern and the 
book of pacts, within easy reach. 

At the rear of the room, before 
the curtained door to the kitchen, 
was another circle, quite as big as 
the first, in the center of which 
was a covered altar. That had been 
empty this afternoon; but there now 
lay upon it the nude body of the girl 
Ware had used to address as Gret- 
chen. Her skin was paper-white 
except for its markings and to 
Baines gave every appearance of 
being dead. A small twist of violet 
silk, nearly transparent and with 
some crumpled thing like a wad of 
tissue or a broken matzoh inside 
it, rested upon her navel. Her body 
appeared to have been extensively 
written upon with red and yellow 
greasepaint; some of the characters 
might have ibeen astrological, others 
more like ideograms or cartouches. 
In default of knowing their mean- 
ing or even their provenance, they 
simply made her look more naked. 

The main door closed. Everyone 
was now in place. 



Ware lit the candles and then 
the in the brazier. It was the 
task 0$ Baines and Hess to feed 
the fire periodically, as the time 
wore on, the one with brandy, the 
other with camphor, taking care 
not to stumble over their swords 
or leave their circles in the process. 
As before, they had been enjoined 
to the strictest silence, especially 
should any spirit speak to them or 
threaten them. 

Ware now reached out to the lec- 
tern and opened his book. This time 
there were no preliminairy gestures 
and no portents; he simply began 
to recite in a gravid voice: 

“I conjure and command thee, 
Lucifuge Rofocale, by all the 
names wherewith thou mayest be 
constrained and bound, Satan, Ran- 
TAN, Pallantre, Lutias, Oorica- 
COEM, SciRCiGREUR, per sedem Bal- 
darey et per gratiam et diligentiam 
tuam habuisti ab eo hone nalati- 
manamilam, as I command thee, 
usor, dilapidatore, tentatore, semi- 
natore, soignatore, devoratore, con- 
citore, et seductore, where art thou? 
Thou who imposeth hatred and 
propagateth enmities, I conjure thee 
by Him, who hath created thee for 
this ministry, to fulfill my work! 
I cite thee, Colriziana, Offina, 
Alta, Nestera, Fuard, Menuet, 
Lucifuge Rofocale, arise, arise, 
arise!” 

T here was no sound; but sud- 
denly there was standing in the 
other circle a dim, steaiming figure, 
perhaps eight or nine feet tidl. It 
was difficult to be sure what it 
looked like, partly because some of 



FAUST ALEPH-NULL 



141 




the altar could still be seen through 
it. To Baines it resembled a man 
with a shaven head bearing three 
long, twisted horns, eyes like a spec- 
tral tarsier’s, a gaping mouth, a 
pointed chin. It was wearing a sort 
of jerkin, coppery in color, with a 
tattered ruff and a fringed skirt; be- 
low the skirt protruded two ban- 
dy, hooved legs and a fat, hairy 
tail which twitched restlessly. 

“What now?” this creature said 
in an astonishingly pleasant voice. 
The words, however, were blurred. 
“I have not seen my son in many 
moons.” Unexpectedly, it giggled, 
as though pleased by the pun. 

“I adjure thee, speak more clear- 
ly,” Ware said. “And what I wish, 
thou knowst full well.” 

“Nothing may be known until 
it is spoken.” The voice seemed no 
less blurred to Baines, but Ware 
nodded. 

“I desire then to release, as did 
the Babylonian from under the seal 
of the King of Israel, blessed be he, 
from Hell-mouth into the mortal 
world all those demons of the False 
Monarchy whose names I shall sub- 
sequently call and whose charac- 
ters and signs I shall exhibit in my 
book, providing only that they 
harm not me and mine and that 
they shall return whence they came 
at dawn, as it is always decreed.” 

“Providing no more than that?” 
the figure said. “No prescriptions? 
No desires? You were not always so 
easily satisfied.” 

“None,” Ware said firmly. “They 
shall do as they will for this their 
period of freedom, except that they 
harm none here in my circles and 

142 



obey me when recalled, by rod and 

pact.” 

The demon glanced over its trans- 
parent shoulder. “I see that you 
have the appropriate fumigant to 
cense so many great lords; and my 
servants and satraps will have their 
several rewards in their deeds. So 
interesting a commission is new to 
me. Well. What have you for my 
hostage, to fulfill the forms?” 

Ware reached into his vestments. 
Baines half expected to see pro- 
duced another tear-vase, but in- 
stead Ware brought out by the tail 
a live mouse, which he threw over 
the brazier as he had the vase, ex- 
cept not so far. The mouse ran 
directly toward the demon, circled 
it frantically three times outside the 
markings and disappeared in the 
direction of the rear door, cheeping 
like a sparrow. Baines looked toward 
Ahktoi, but the cat did not even 
lick its chops. 

“You are skilled and punctilious, 
my son. Call then when I have left, 
and I will send my ministers. Let 
nothing remain undone, and much 
will be done before the black cock 
crows.” 

“It is well. By and under this 
promise I discharge thee. Omgroma, 
Epyn, Seyok, Satany, Degony, 
Eparygon, Galliganon, Zogogen, 
Ferstigon, Lucifuge Rofocale, 
begone, begone, begone!” 

“I shall see you at dawn.” The 
prime minister of Lucifer wavered 
like a flame and, like a flame, went 
out. 

Hess promptly cast camphor in- 
to the brazier. Recovering with a 
start from a near paralysis of fas- 

IF 




cination, Baines sprinkled brandy 
after it. The fire puffed. Without 
looking around, Ware brought out 
his lodestone, which he held in his 
left hand; with his right, he dipped 
the iron-headed point of his wand 
into the coals. Little licking points 
of blue light ran up it almost to 
his hand, as though the rod too 
had been coated with brandy. 

Holding the tonguing wand out 
before him like a dowsing-rod, Ware 
strode ceremoniously out of the 
Grand Circle toward the altar. As 
he walked, the air around him be- 
gan to grumble, as though a storm 
were gathering about his shaven 
head, but he paid the noise no 
attention. He marched on directly 
to the locus spirifus and on into it. 

S ilence fell at once. Ware said 
clearly: 

“I, Theron Ware, master of mas- 
ters, Karcist of Karcists, hereby 
undertake to open the book and 
the seals thereof, which were for- 
bidden to be broken until the break- 
ing of the Seven Seals before the 
Seventh Throne. I have beheld 
Satan as a bolt falling from heaven. 
I have crushed the dragons of the 
pit beneath my heel. I have com- 
manded angels and devils. I under- 
take and command that all shall be 
accomplished as I bid, and that from 
beginning to end, alpha to omega, 
world without end, none shall harm 
us who abide here in this temple of 
the Art of Arts. Aglan, Tetra- 
GRAM, vaycheon stimulamaton ez- 
phares retragrammaton olyaram ir~ 
ion esytion existion eryona onera 
orasym mozm messias soter Eman- 



uel Sabaoth Adonay, te adoro, et 
te invoco. Amen.” 

He took another step forward 
and touched the flaming tip of the 
rod to the veil of silk on the belly 
of the still girl. A little curl of 
blue-gray smoke began to rise from 
it, like ^ ignited incense. 

Ware now retreated, walking 
backwards, toward the Grand Cir- 
cle. As he did so, the fire on the 
wand died; but in the mortuary si- 
lence there now intrude a C^t 
hissing, much like the dSirst lo- 
tion of a squib. And there were 
indeed fireworks in incq>tion. As 
Baines stared in gluttonous hypno- 
sis, a small fountain of many- 
colored sparks began to rise from 
the fuselike tissue on the abdomen 
of the body on the altar. More 
smoke poured forth. The air was 
becoming distinctly hazy. 

The body itself seemed to be 
burning now, the skin peeling bade 
like segments of an orange. Baines 
heard behind him an aborted retch- 
ing noise in Jack Ginsberg’s voice, 
but could not himself understand 
what the occasion for nausea could 
be. The body — whatever it had 
once been — was now only a sim- 
ulacrum made of pith or papier- 
mache, and charged with some 
equivalent of Greek fire. Indeed, 
there was already a strong taint 
of gunpowder overriding the pre- 
vious odors of incense and cam- 
phor. Baines rather welcomed it — 
not that it was familiar, for it had 
been centuries since black powder 
had been used in his trade, but 
because he had 'begun to find the 



FAUST ALEPH-NUU 



143 




accumulation of less businesslike 
perfumes cloying. 

Gradually, everything melted 
away into the smoke exceipt an 
underlay of architectural outline, 
against which stood a statues 
lit more along one side than the 
other by one oif the two sources 
of fire. Hess coughed briefly; other- 
wise theic was silence except for 
the hissing of the pyre. Sparks 
continued to fly upward, and some- 
times, for an instant, they seemed 
to form scriibbled incomprehensible 
words in the frame of the unreal 
wall. 

Ware’s voice sounded remotely 
from one of the statues: 

“Baal, great king and commander 
in the East, of the Order of the 
Fly; obey me!” 

Something began to form in the 
distance. Baines had the clear im- 
pacssion that it was ibehind the 
altar, behind the curtained door, 
indeed outside the palazzo alto- 
gether; but he could see k never- 
theless. It came forward, growing, 
until he could see that it was a 
thing like a man, in a neat sur- 
coat and snow-white linen, but 
with two supernumerary heads, the 
one on the left like a toad’s, the 
Other like a cat’s. It swelled sound- 
lessly until at some moment it was 
inapguably in the rectory and then, 
still silently, had grown past them 
and was gone. 

“Agares, duke in the East, of 
the Order of the Virtues; obey me!” 

Again, a distant transparency, and 
silent. It came on very slowly, mani- 
festing like a comely old man car- 
rying a goshawk upon his wrist. 



Its slowness was necessitous, for it 
was ridii^ astride an amUing croc 
odile. Its eyes were closed, and its 
lips moved incessantly. Gradually, 
it too swelled past. 

“Gamygyn, marquis and presi- 
dent of Cartagra; obey mei” 

This grew to be something like 
a small horse, or perhaps an ass, 
modest and unassuming. It dragged 
behind it ten naked men in chains. 

“Valefor, powerful duke; obey 
me!” 

A black-maned lion, again with 
three heads, the other two human, 
one wearing the cap of a hunter, 
the other the wary smile of a 
thief. It passed in a rush, without 
even a wind to mark its going. 

“Barbatos, great count and min- 
ister of Satanachia; obey me!” 

But this was not one figure; it 
was four, like four crowned kings. 
With it and past it poured three 
companies of soldiers, their heads 
bowed and their expressions shut- 
tered and still under steel caps. 
When all this troop had vanished, 
it was impossible to guess which 
among them had been the demon, 
or if the demon had ever appeared. 

“Paimon, great king, of the Or- 
der of the Dominions, obey me!” 

S uddenly after all the hissing 
silence there was a blast of 
sound, and the room was full of 
capering things carrying contorted 
tubes and bladders which might have 
been intended as musical instru- 
ments. The noise, however, resem- 
bled most closely a drove of pigs 
being driven down the chute of a 
slaughterhouse. Among the bawling. 



144 



IF 




squealing dancers a crowned man 
rode upon a dromedary, bawling 
wordlessly in a great hoarse voice. 
The beast it rode on chewed grimly 
on some bitter cud, its eyes squeezed 
shut as if in pain. 

“Sytry/” Ware shouted. Instant- 
ly there was darkness and quiet, 
except for the hissing, which now 
had a faint overtone as of chil- 
dren’s voice. ^''Jussus secreta libenter 
detfgit feminarum, eas ridens ludi- 
ficansque ut se luxorise nudent; 
great prince, obey me!” 

This sweet and lissome thing was 
no less monstrous than the rest; it 
had a glowing human body, but was 
winiged and had the ridiculously 
small, smirking head of a leopard. 
At the same time, it was beautiful, 
in some way that made Baines feel 
both sick and eager at the same 
time. As it passed. Ware seemed 
to be pressing a ring against his 
lips. 

“Lerajie, powerful marquis; Eli- 
GOR, Zepar, great dukes, obey me!” 

As they were called together, so 
these three appeared together: the 
first an archer clad in green, with 
quiver and a nocked bow whose ar- 
row dripped venom; the second, a 
knight with a scepter and a pennon- 
bearing lance; the third, an armed 
soldier clad in red. In contrast to 
their predecessor, there was nothing 
in the least monstrous about their 
appearance, nor any due as to thedr 
sj^eres and offices, but Baines found 
them no less alarming for all that. 

“Ayporos, ^ mighty earl and 
prince: obey me!” 

Baines felt himself turning sick 
even before this creature appeared. 



and from the sounds around him, 
so did the others, even including 
Ware. There w«is no sipeoial reason 
for this apparent in its aspect, which 
was so grotesque as to have been 
comic under other oLreumstanoes: it 
had the body of an angel, with a 
lion’s head, the webbed feet of a 
goose and the scut of a deer. ‘Trans- 
form, transform!” Ware cried, thrust- 
ing his wand into the brazier. The 
visitant promptly took on the total 
appearance of an angel, crown to 
toe, but the effect of the presenoe 
of something filthy and obscene re- 
mained. 

“Haborym, strong duke, obey 
me!” 

This was another man-thing of 
the three-^headed race — thou^ the 
apparent relationship, Baines re- 
alized, must be pure accident — 
the human one bearing two stars on 
its forehead, the others of a serpent 
and a cat. In its right hand it carried 
a brazing fire-brand which it shook 
at them as it passed. 

“Naberius, valiant marquis, obey 
me!” 

At first it seemed to Baines that 
there had been no response to this 
call. Then he saw movement near 
the floor. A black cock with bleed- 
ing, empty eye-sockets was fluititediig 
around the outsidie of the Grand Cir- 
cle. Ware menaced it with the wand, 
and it crowed hoarsely and was gone. 

“Glasyalabolas, mighty presi- 
dent, obey mo!** 

This appeared to be simply a 
winged man until it smiled, when 
it could be seen to have the teeth of 
a dog. There were flecks of fb a m 
at its mouth. It passed sountSeBsly.

In the silence, Baines oouiLd hear 
Ware turning a page in his book of 
pacts and remembered to cast more 
brandy into the brazier. The body 
on the altar had apparently long 
since been consumed; Baines could 
not remember how long it had been 
since he had seen the last of the 
word-forming sparks. The thick gray 
haze persisted, however. 

“Bune, thou strong duke, obey 
me!” 

This apparition was the most mar- 
velous yet, for it approached them 
borne on a galleon, which sank 
into the floor as it came nearer un- 
til they were able to look down 
through the floor onto its deck. 
Coiled there was a dragon with the 
familiar three heads, these being of 
dog, griffin and man. Shadowy fig- 
ures, vaguely human, toiled around 
it. It continued to sink until it was 
behind them, and presumably there- 
after. 

Its passage left Baines aware that 
he was trembling — not from 
fright, exactly, for he seemed to 
have passed beyond that, but from 
the very exhaustion of this and other 
emotions and possibly also from the 
sheer weariness of having stood in 
one spot for so long. Inadvertently, 
he sighed. 

“Silence,” Ware said in a low 
voice. “And let nobody weaken or 
falter at this point. We are but half 
done with our calling — and of 
those remaining to be invoked, many 
are far more powerful than any 
we’ve yet seen. I warned you be- 
fore, this Art takes physical strength 
as well as courage.” 

He turned another page. “Asta- 



ROTH, grand treasurer, great and 
powerful duke, obey me!” 

E ven Baines had heard of this 
demon, though he could not 
remember where, and watched it 
materialize with a stirring of 
curiosity. Yet it was nothing re- 
markable in the light of what he 
had seen already: on angelic figure, 
at once beautlM and foul, seated 
astride a dragon. It carried a viper 
in its right hand. He remembered 
belatedly that these spirits, never 
having been matter in the first place, 
had to borrow a body to make ap- 
pearances like this and would not 
necessarily pick the same one each 
time; the previous descriptioa of 
Astaroth that he bad read, he now 
recalled, had been that of a piebaM 
Negro woman riding on an ass. As 
the creature passed him, it smiled 
into his face, and the stench of its 
breath nearly knocked him down. 

“Asmoday, strong and powerful 
king, chief of the power of Amay- 
mon, angel of chance, obey me!” As 
he called. Ware swept off his hot 
with his left hand, taking care, Baines 
noted, not to drop the lodestone 
as he did so. 

This king also rode a dragon, and 
also had three heads — bull, man 
and ram. All three heads breathed 
fire. The creature’s feet were 
webbed, as were its hands, in which 
it carried a lance and pennon; and 
it had a serpent’s tail. Fearsome 
enough; but Baines was beginning 
to note a certain narrowness of in- 
vention among these infernal artis- 
ans. It also occurred to him to won- 
der, fortunately, whether this very 



146 



IF 




repetitiveness was not deliberaite, in- 
tended to tire him into inaittenitive- 
ness or lure him into the oaireless- 
ness of comtempt. This thing might 
kill me if I even closed my eyes, 
he lemanded hims elf. 

“Furfur, great earl, obey mel” 

This anigel appeared as a hart 
and was past them in a single bound, 
its tail streaming fire like a comet. 

Halpas, gjeat earl, obey me!” 

There was nothing to this appari- 
tion but a stockdove, also quickly 
gone. Ware was calling the names 
now as rapidly as he could manage 
to turn the pages, perhaps in recog- 
nition of the growing weariness of 
his Tanists, perhaps even of his own. 
The demons flashed by in nightmare 
parade: Raym, earl of the Order of 
the Thrones, a man with a crow’s 
head; Separ, a mermaid wealing a 
ducal crown; Saburac, a lion-headed 
soldier upon a pale horse; Bifrons, 
a great ead in the shape of a gigantic 
flea; Zagan, a griffm-winged buU; 
Andras, a raven-headed angel with 
a bright sword, astride a black wolf; 
Andrealphus, a peacock appearing 
amid the noise of many unseen birds; 
Amduscias, a unicorn among many 
musicians; Dantalian, a mighty 
duke in the form of a man but show- 
ing many faces both of men and 
women, with a book in his right 
band; and at long last, that mighty 
king created next after Lucifer and 
the first to fell in battle before 
Michael, formeriy of the Order of 
the Virtues, Belial himself, beauti- 
ful end 4^adly in a chariot of fire 
as he iiad been worshipped in Baby- 
km. 

“Now, great spirits,” Ware said, 



“because ye have diligently answered 
me and si^wn yoorseilYes to my de- 
mands, I do hereby license ye to de- 
part, without injury to any here. 
Depart, I say, yet be ye willing and 
ready to come at the appointed hour, 
when I shall duly exorcise and con- 
jure you by your rites and seals. Un- 
til then, ye abide free. Amen.” 

He snuffed out the fire in the 
brazier with a closely fitting lid on 
which was graven the Third or Secret 
Seal of Solomon. The murk in the 
refectory began to lift. 

“All right,” Ware said in a matter 
of fact voice. Strangely, he seemed 
much less tired than he had after 
the conjuration of Marchosias. 
over — or rather, it’s begun. Mr. 
Ginsberg, you can safely leave your 
circle now and turn on the lig^.” 

When Ginsberg had done so. Ware 
also snuffed the candles. In the loght 
of the shaded electrics, the hall seem- 
ed in the throes of a Peerless dawn, 
although in fact the time was not 
past midnight. There was nothing on 
the altar now but a small heap of 
fine gray ash. 

“Do we really have to wait it out 
in here?” Baines said, feeling himself 
sagging. “1 should think we’d be a 
lot more comfortable in your office 
— and in a ibetter position to find 
out what’s going on, too.” 

“We must remain here,” Ware said 
firmly. “That, Mr. Baines, is why 
I asked you to bring fai your transis- 
tor radio — to keep track of both the 
world and the rime. For approxi- 
mately the next eight^lioiiiis, the area 
inside these imniediiate walls will 
be the only safe place on all the 
Earth.”

T rappimigs, litter and all, the re- 
fectxwy now reminded Baines 
incongruously of an initaaition room 
in a college fraterniity house just 
after itihe last night of Hell Week. 
Hess was asleep on the long table 
that earlier had home Ware’s con- 
secrated instruments. Jack Ginsberg 
lay on the floor near the main door, 
napping fitfully, mumbling and 
sweating. Theron Ware, after again 
warning everyone not to touch any- 
thing, had dusted off the altar and 
gone to sleep — apparently quite 
soundly — upon that, still robed 
and gowned. 

Only Baines and Fr. Domenico 
remained awake. The monk, having 
prowled once around 'the margins of 
the room, had found an unsuspected 
low window behind a curtain and 
now stood with his back to them all 
looking out at the black world, hands 
locked behind his back. 

Baines sat on the floor with his 
own back propped against the wall 
next to the electric furnace, the 
transistor radio pressed to his ear. 
He was brutally uncomfortable, but 
he had found by experiment that this 
was the 'best place in the hall for 
radio reception — barring, of course, 
his actually entering one of the Cir- 
cles. 

Even here, the reception was not 
very good. It wavered in and out 
maddeningly, even on powerful sta- 
tions like Radio Luxembourg, and 
wias liable to tearing blasts of static. 
These were usually followed, at in- 
tervals of a few seconds to several 
minutes, by bursts or rolls of thun-

der in the sky outside. Much of the 
time, too, as was usual, ^ the dear 
spaces were occupied by nothing but 
music and oommerdals. 

And thus far, what little news he 
had been able to pick up had been 
vaguely disappointing. There had 
been a major train wreck in Colora- 
do; a freighter was foundering in 
a blizzard in ithe North Sea; in Gua- 
temala, a small dam had burst, bury- 
ing a town in an enormous mud- 
slide; an earthquake was reported 
in Corinth — the usual budget of 
natural or near-natural disasters for 
any day. 

In addition, the Chinese had 
detonated another hydrogen device; 
there had been another raiding in- 
cident on the Israeili-Jordanian bor- 
der; black tribesmen had staged a 
rape and massacre on a government 
hospital in Rhodesia; the poor were 
marching on Washington again; the 
Soviet Union had announced that it 
would not be able to recover three 
dogs and a monkey it had put in or- 
bit a week ago; the U.S. gained an- 
other bloody inch in Vietnam, and 
Premier Ky put his foot in it; 
and .... 

All perfectly ordinary, all go- 
ing to prove what everyone of good 
sense already knew, that there was 
no safe place on the Earth either 
inside this room or without it, and 
probably there never had been. What, 
Baines began to wonder, was the 
profit in turning loose so many 
demons, at so enormous an expendi- 
ture of time, effort and money, if 
the only result were to be just like 
reading any morning’s newspaper? 
Of course, it might be that inter- 



esting private outrages were also be- 
ing committed, but many newspaper 
and other publishers made fortunes 
on those in ordinary times, and in 
any event he could never hear of 
more than a fraction of them over 
this idiot machine. 

Probably he would just have to 
wait until days or weeks later, when 
the full record and history of this 
night had been assembled and digest- 
ed, when no doubt its full enormity 
might duly appear. He should have 
expected nothing else. After all, the 
full impact of a work of art is never 
visible in the sketches. All ithe same, 
he was obstinately disappointed to 
be deprived of the artist’s excitement 
of watching the work growing on the 
canvas. 

Was there anything that Ware 
could do about that? Almost surely 
not, or he would have done it al- 
ready; it was clear that he had un- 
derstood the motive behind the com- 
mission as well as he had understood 
its nature. Besides, it would be dan- 
gerous to wake him — he would 
need all his strength for the latter 
half of the experiment, when the 
demons began to return. 

Resentfully, but with some resig- 
nation too, Baines realized that he 
himself had never been the 'artist 
here. He was only the patron, who 
could watch the colors being applied 
and the cartoon being filled; he 
could own the finished board or 
ceiling, but had never even in princi- 
ple been capable of handling the 
brushes. 

But here — what was that? The 
BBC was reporting: 

“A third contingent of appara- 

IF 



150 




tus has been dispatched along the 
Thames to combat the Tate Gallery 
fire. Expert observers believe there 
is no hope of saving the Gallery’s 
great collection of Blake paintings, 
which include most of his illustra- 
tions for’ the Inferno and Purgatorio 
of Dante. Hope also appears to be 
lost for what amount to almost all 
the world’s paintings by Turner, in- 
cluding his water colors of the burn- 
ing of the Houses of Parliament. 
The intense and sudden nature of 
the initial outbreak has lead to the 
suspicion that the fire is the work 
of an incendiary.” 

B aines sat up alertly, though all 
his joints protested painfully, 
feeling an even more acute stab of 
hope. There was a crime with real 
style, a crime with symbolism, a crime 
with meaning. Excitedly he remem- 
bered Haborym, the demon with 
the dripping firebrand. Now if there 
were to be more acts that imagina- 
tive — 

The reception was getting steadily 
worse; it was extraordinarily tiring 
to be continuously straining to filter 
meaning out of it. Radio Luxem- 
bourg appeared to have gone off 
the air or to have been shut out by 
some atmospheric disturbance. He 
tried Radio Milan and got it just in 
time to hear it announce itself about 
to play all eleven of the symphonies 
of Gustav Mahler, one right after 
the other, an insane project for any 
station and particularly for an 
Italian one. Was that some demon’s 
idea of a joke? Whatever the answer, 
it was going to take Radio Milan 
out of the newscasting business for 



well over twenty-four hours to come. 

He cast further about the dial. 
There seemed to be an extraordinary 
number of broadcasts going out in 
languages he did not know or could 
even recognize, though he could get 
around passably in seventeen stan- 
dard tongues and in any given year 
was fluent in a different set of three, 
depending on business requirements. 
It was almost as though someone had 
jammed an antenna on the crown 
of Babel. 

Briefly, he caught a strong out- 
burst of English; but it was only 
the Voice of America making pious- 
ly pejorative sermonettes about the 
Chinese fusion explosion. Baines had 
known that that was coming for 
months now. Then the multilingual 
mumbling and chuntering resumed, 
interspersed occasionally with squeals 
of what might indifferently hare 
been Pakistani jazz or Chinese opera. 

Another segment of English shout- 
ed, “ — with Cyanotabsl Yes, 
friends, one dose cures all illsl Guar- 
anteed chock-full of crisp, crunchy 
atoms — ” and was replaced by a 
large boys’ choir singing the Halle- 
lujah Chorus, the words for which, 
however, seemed to go, “Bison, 
bison! Rattus, rattus! Cardinalis! 
Cardinalis!” Then more gabble, 
marvelously static-free and some- 
times hovering just on the edge of 
intelligibility. 

The room stank abominably of 
an amazing mixture of reeks: bran- 
dy, camphor, charcoal, vervain, gun- 
powder, flesh, sweat, perfume, in- 
cense, candle-wicks, musk, singed 
hair. Baines’s head ached dully; it 
was like trying to breathe inside

the mouth of a vulture. He longed 
to take a pull ait the brandy bottle 
under his rumpled alb, but he did 
not know how much of what was 
left would be needed when Ware re- 
sumed operations. 

Across from him, something 
moved: Fr. Domenico had unlocked 
his hands and turned away from 
the small window. He was now tak- 
ing a few prim steps toward Baines. 
The slight stir of human life seemed 
to disturb Jack Ginserg, who thrash- 
ed himself into an even more un- 
comfortable-looking position, shouted 
hoarsely and then began to snore. Fr. 
Domenico shot a glance at him and, 
stopping just short of his side of the 
Grand Circle, beckoned. 

“Me?” Baines said. 

Fr. Domenico nodded patiently. 
Putting aside the overheated little 
radio with less reluctance than he 
would have imagined possible only 
an hour ago, Biaines heaved himsei 
arthiitioally to his knees, and then 
to his feet. 

As he started to stumble toward 
the monk, something furry hurtled 
in front of him and nearly made 
him fall: Ware’s cat. It was darting 
toward the altar; and in a soaring 
arc incredible in an animal of its 
shameless obesity, it leapt up there 
and settled down on the rump of its 
sleeping master. It looked greenly at 
Baines and went itself to sleep, or 
appeared to. 

Fr. Domenico beckoned again 
and went back to the window. 
Baines limped after him, wishing 
that he had taken off his shoes; his 
feet felt as though they had turned 
into solid blocks of horn. 



“What’s the matter?” he whisper- 
ed. 

“Look out there, Mr. Baines.” 

C onfused and aching, Baines peer- 
ed past his uninvited and unim- 
pressive Virgil. At first he could see 
nothing but the streaked steam on 
the inside of the glass, with a spume 
of fat snowflakes slurrying beyond 
it. Then he saw that the night was 
in fact not wholly dark. Somehow 
he could sense ^e undersides of 
turbulent clouds. Below, the win- 
dow, Hke the one in Ware’s office, 
looked down the side of the diff and 
out over the sea, which was largely 
invisible in the snowwhorls; so 
should the town have (been, but it 
was in fact faintly luminous. Over- 
head, from frame to frame of the 
window, the clouds were overstitclhed 
with continuous streaks of dim fibre, 
like phosphorescent oontrails, long- 
lasting and taking no part in the 
weather. 

“Well?” Baines said. 

“You don’t see anything?’’ 

“I see the meteor-tracks or what- 
ever they are. And the light is odd. 
Sheet lightning, I suppose, and may- 
be a fire somewhere in town.” 
“That’s all?” 

“That’s all,” Baines said, irritaited. 
“What are you trying to do, panic 
me into waking Dr. Ware and oaMinig 
it all quits? Nothing doing. We’H wait 
it out.” 

“All right,” Fr. Domenico said, 
resuming his vigil. Baines stumped 
back to his comer and picked up 
the radio. It said: 

^ now established that the sup- 
posed Chinese fusion test was actual-

ly a missile warhead explosion of 
at least lihirty megaitons, cenitered 
on Taiwan. Western capitals, al- 
ready in an uproar because of the 
napalm murder of the U.S. presi- 
dent’s widow in a jammed New 
York discotheque, are moving quick- 
ly to a full war footing, and we ex- 
pect a series of security blackouts on 
the news at any moment. Undl that 
happens we will keep you informed 
of whatever important events come 
through. We pause for station identi- 
cation. Owoo. Eeg. Oh, piggly baby, 
I caught you — cheatin’ on me — 
owoo — ” 

Baines twisted the dial savagely, 
but the howling only became more 
bestial. Down the wall to his right, 
Hess twisted his long body on the 
table and suddenly sat upright, 
swinging his stockinged feet to the 
floor. 

“Jesus Christ,” he said huskily. 
“Did I hear what I thought I heard?” 

“Dead right you did,” Baines said 
quietly, and not without joy; but he 
too was worried. “Slide over here 
and sit down. Something’s coming 
to a head, and it’s nothing like we’d 
expected — or Ware either.” 

“Hadn’t we better call a halt, 
then?” 

“No, Sit down, goddamn it. I don’t 
think we can call a halt — and even 
if we could, I don’t want to give 
our clerical friend over there the 
satisfaction.” 

“You’d rather have World War 
Three?” Hess said, sitting down 
obediently. 

“I don’t know that that’s what’s 
going to happen. We contracted for 
this; let’s give it the benefit of the 



doubt. Either Ware’s in control, or 
he should be. Let’s wait and see.” 
“All right/’ Hess said. He bepm 
to knead his fingers togeOier. 
Baines tried the radio once mere, 
but nothing was coming throui^ 
but a mixture of the Messiah, Mah- 
ler and The Supremes. 

Jack Ginsberg whined in his 
pseudosleep. After a while, Hess 
said neutrally: 

“Baines?” 

“What is it?” 

“What kind of a thing do you 
think thi«t is?” 

“Well, it’s either World War Three 
or it isn’t. How can I know yet?” 
“1 didn’t ask you that . not 
what you think it is. I asked you, 
what kind of a thing do you tfhhak: 
it is? You ought to have some sort 
of notion. After all, you contracted 
for it.” 

“Oh. Hmm. Father Domemoo 
said it might turn out to be Arma- 
geddon. Ware didn’t think so, but he 
hasn’t turned out to be very rigjat 
up to now. I can’t guess, mysdf. I 
haven’t been thinking in these terms 
very long.” 

4 4 watefa- 

ing his fingers weave them- 
selves in and out. “I’m still trying 
to make sense of it in the old terms, 
the ones that used to make sense 
of the universe to me. It isn’t easy. 
But you’ll remember I told you I 
was interested in the history of sci- 
ence. That involves trying to under- 
stand why there wasn’t any science 
for so long, and why it went into 
eclipse almost every time it was re- 
discovered. I think I know why now.

Dark Age . every time with a 
new, invented mystical leason.” 

“You’re not making very much 
sense,” Baines said. He was still 
also trying to listen to the radio. 

“I didn’t expect you to think so. 
But it happens. It happens about 
every thousand years. People start 
out happy with their gods, even 
though they’re frightened of them. 
Then, increasin^y, the world be- 
comes secularized, and (the gods 
seem less and less relevant. The 
temples are deserted. People feel 
guilty about that, but not much. 
Then, suddenly, they’ve had al the 
secularization they can take, they 
throw their woodim shoes into the 
machines, they take to worshipping 
Satan or the Great Mother, they go 
into a Hellenistic period or take up 
Christianity, in hoc signo vinces — 
I’ve got those all out of order, but 
it happens, Baines, it happens like 
clockwork, every thousand years. 
The last time was the chiliastic 
panics just before the year 1000 
A.D., when everyone C3q>ected the 
Second Coming of Christ and re- 
alized that they didn’t dare face up 
to Him. That was the heart, the 
center, the whole reason of the Dark 
Ages. Well, we’ve got another mil- 
lenium coming to a dose now, and 
people ore terrified of our seculari- 
zation, our nuclear and biological 
weapons, our computers, our over- 
protective medicine, everything, and 



they’re turning back to the worship 
of unreason. Just os you’ve done — 
and I’ve helped you. Some people 
these days worsiMp flying saucers 
because i&ey don’t dare face up to 
Ohirist. You’ve turned to black 
magic. Where’s the difference?” 

“I’ll tell you where,” Baines said. 
“Nobody in the whole of time has 
ever seen a saucer, and the reasons 
for believing that anybody has ore 
utterly pitiable. Probl^ly they can 
be explained just as you’ve explained 
them, and never mind about Jung 
and his thump-headed crowd. But, 
Adolph, you and I have seen a 
demon.” 

“Do you think so? I don’t deny it. 
I think it very possible. But Baines, 
are you sure? How do you know 
what you think you know? We’re on 
the eve of World War Three, which 
we engineered. Couldn’t all this be a 
ballucmatiion we conjured up to re- 
move some of our guilt? Or is it 
possible that it isn’t happening at 
all and that we’re as much victims 
of a chiliastic panic as more formal- 
ly religious people are? That makes 
more sense to me than all this medie- 
val mumho-jumbo about demons. 1 
don’t mean to deny the evidence of 
my senses, Baines; I only mean to 
ask you, what is it worth?” 

“I’ll tdl you what I know,” 
Biaines said equably, “though I can’t 
tell you how I know it, and I won’t 
bother to try. First, something is 
happening, and that something is 
real. Second, you and I and Ware 
and everyone else who wanted to 
make it happen, therefore did make 
it 'happen. Third, we’ire turning out 
to be wrong about the outcome —

but no matter what it is, it’s our 
outcome; we contracted for it. 
Demons, saucers, fallout — what’s 
the difference? Those are just signs 
in the equation, parameters we can 
fill any way that makes the most 
intermediate sense to us. Are you 
happier with electrons than with 
demons? Okay, ^ood for you. But 
what I like, Adolph, what / like is 
the result; I don’t give a damn about 
the means. I invented it, I called it 
into being. I’m paying for it — and 
no matter how else you describe 
it, 7 made it, and ifs mine. Is that 
clear? Ifs mine. Every other possible 
fact about it, no matter what that 
fact might turn out to be, is a stupid 
footling technicality that I hire peo- 
ple like you and Ware not to bother 
me with.” 

“It seems to me,” Hess said in a 
leaden monotone, “that we are all 
insane.” 

At that same moment, the small 
window burst into an intense white 
glare, turning Fr. Domenico into the 
intensest of inky silhouettes. 

“You may be right,” Baines said. 
“There goes Rome.” 

Fr. Domenico, his eyes streaming, 
turned away from the dimming 
frame and picked his way slowly to 
the altar. After a long moment of 
distaste, he took Theron Ware by 
the shoulder and shook him. The cat 
hissed and jumped sidewise. 

“Wake up, Theron Ware,” Fr. 
Domenico said formally. “I charge 
you, awake. Your experiment may 
now wholly and contractually be said 
to have gone astray, and the Coven- 
ant therefore satisfied. Ware! Ware! 
Wake up, damn you!” 



B aines looked at his watch. It was 
3:00 a.m. 

Ware awoke instantly, swung to 
his feet with a spring, and without 
a word started for the window. At 
the same instant, the agony that had 
been Rome swept over the building. 
The shock wave had been attenuated 
by distance, and the jolt was not 
heavy; but the window Fr. Domenico 
had uncurtained sprang inward in a 
spray of flying glass needles. More 
glass fell from behind the drapes be- 
low the ceiling, like an orchestra of 
celestes. 

As far as Baines could see, nobody 
was more than slightly cut. Not that 
a serious wound could have made 
any difference now, with the Last 
Death already riding on the winds. 

Ware was not visibly shaken. He 
simply nodded once and wheeled 
toward the Grand Circle, stooping 
to pick up his dented paper hat. No, 
he was moved — his lips were 
pinched white. He beckoned to them 
all. 

Baines took a step toward Jack 
Ginsberg, to kick him awake if 
necessary. But the special executive 
assistant was already on his feet, 
trembling and wild-eyed. He seem- 
ed, however, totally unaware of 
where he was; Baines had to push 
him bodily into his minor Circle. 

“And stay there,” Baines added, 
in a voice that should have been 
able to scar diamonds. But Jack 
gave no sign of having heard it. 

Baines went hastily to his Tanist’s 
place, checking for the bottle of 
brandy. Everyone else was already

in position, even the cat, which in 
fact had vaulted to its post promptly 
upon having been dumped off 
Ware’s rear. 

The sorcerer lit the brazier and 
began to address the dead air. He 
was hardly more than a senjtence in- 
to this invocation before Baines re- 
alized for the first time, in his freez- 
ing heart, that this was indeed the 
last effort — and that indeed they 
might all still be saved. 

Ware was making his renuncia- 
tion, in his own black and twisted 
way — the only way his fatally 
proud soul could ever be brought to 
make it. He said: 

“I invoke and conjure thee, 
Lucifuge Rofocale, and fortified 
with the Power and the Supreme 
Majesty, I strongly command thee 

by BaRALEMENSIS, BALDACfflENSIS, 

Paumachie, Apoloresedes and the 
most potent princes Genio, Lia- 
CHiDE, Ministers of the Tartarean 
seat, chief princes of the seat of 
Apologia in the ninth region; I ex- 
orcise and command thee, Lucifuge 
Rofocai^e, by Him Who spake and 
it was done, by the Most Holy and 
Glorious Names Adonai, El, Elo- 
HiM, Elohe, Zebaoth, Elion, 
Escherce, Jah, Tetragrammaton, 
Sadai: do thou and thine forthwith 
appear and show thyself unto me, 
regardless of how thou art previous- 
ly charged, from whatever part of 
the world, without tarrying! 

“I conjure thee by Him to Whom 
all creatures are obedient, by this* 
ineffable Name, Tetragrammaton 
Jehovah, by which the elements are 
overthrown, the air is shaken, the 
sea turns back, the fire is generated. 



the Earth moves and aU the hosts of 
things celestial, of things teirrestrial, 
of things infernal, do treanible and 
are confounded together; come, 
Adonai, King of kings, commands 
thee!” 

There was no answer, ejccept an 
exterior grumble of thunder. 

“Now I invoke, conjure and com- 
mand thee, Lucifuge Rofocale, to 
appear and show thyself before this 
Oirdle, by the Name of On; by the 
Name Y and V, which Adam heard 
and spake; by the Name of Joth, 
which Jacob learned from the angd 
on the night of his wrestling and 
was delivered from the hands of his 
brother; by the Name of Agla, 
which Lot heard and was saved with 
his family; by the Name Anehexe- 
TON, which Aaron spake and was 
made wise; by the Name Schemes 
Amathia, which Joshua invoked and 
the Sim stayed upon his course; by 
the Nome Emmanuel, by which the 
three children were delivered from 
the fiery furnace; by the Name 
Alpha-Omega, which Daniel utter- 
ed and destroyed Bel and the dra- 
gon; by the Name Zebaoth, which 
Moses named, and all the rivers and 
the waters in the land of Egypt were 
turned into blood; by the Name 
Hagios, by the Seal of A1x)nai, by 
those others, which are Jetros, 
Athenoros, Paracletus: by the 
dreadful Day of Judgment; by the 
changing sea of glass which is be- 
fore the face of the Divine Majesty; 
by the four beasts before the Throne; 
by qM these Holy and most potent 
words, come thou, and come thou 
quickly; come, come! Adonai, King 
of kings, commands thee!!” 



Now, at last, there wa» u sound; 
a sound of laughter. It was &e 
taughiter of Something inoapaihle of 
joy, laughing only because It was 
compelled by Its nature to terrify. 
As the lau^ter grew, that Some- 
thing formed. 

I t was not standing in the lesser 
Circle or appearing from the 
Gateway, but instead was sitting on 
the altar, swinging Its cloven feet 
negjigently. It had a goat’s head, 
with immense horns, a crown that 
flamed like a torch, level human 
eyes, and a Star of David on Its 
forehead. Its haunches too were ca- 
prine. Between, the body was hu- 
man, though hairy and with dragging 
black pinions like a crow’s growing 
from Its shoulder-blades. On one 
shaggy forearm was tattooed. Solve; 
on the other, Coagula, 

Ware fell slowly to one knee. 
^"Adoramus te, Put Satanachia,” 
he said, laying his wand on the 
ground before him. “And again . , . 
ave, ave.” 

Ave, but why do you hail me? 
the monster said in a petulant bass 
voice, at once deep and marmered, 
like a homosexual actor’s. It was 

NOT I YOU CALLED. 

“No, Baphomet, master and .guest. 
Never for an instant. It is every- 
where said that you can never be 
called and would never appear.” 
You CALLED ON THE GOD, WhO 
DOTH NOT APPEAR. I AM NOT MOCKED. 

Ware bowed his head lower. “I 
was wrong.” 

Ah! But there is a first time 
FOR everything; YOU might have 
SEEN THE God after all. But now 



158 



IF 




INSTEAD YOU HAVE SEEN Me; AND 
THERE IS ALSO A LAST TIME FOR 
EVERYTHING. I OWE YOU A MOMENT 

OF thanks; worm though you 

ARE, YOU ARE THE AGENT OF ARMA- 
GEDDON. Let that be written, 
BEFORE ALL WRITING, LIKE ALL ELSE, 
GO INTO THE EVERLASTING FIRE. 

“No!” Ware cried out. “Oh, living 
God, no! This cannot be the Timel 
You break ithe Law! Where is the 
Antichrist — ” 

We will DO WITHOUT THE ANTI- 
CHRIST. He was never necessary. 
Men have always led them- 
selves UNTO ME. 

“But — master and guest — the 
Law — ” 

We shall also do without the 
Law. Have you not heard? Those 
Tablets have been broken. 

There was a hiss of indrawn 
breath from boith Ware and Fr. 
Domenico; but if Ware had intend- 
ed some further argument, he was 
forestalled. To Baines’s right. Dr. 
Hess said in a voice of high ultra- 
violet hysteria: 

“I don’t see you. Goat.” 

“Shut up!” Ware shouted, almost 
turning away from the vision. 

“I don’t see you,” Hess said dog- 
gedly. “You’re nothing but a siHy 
sooologioal mixture. A mushroom 
dream. You’re not real. Goat. Go 
away. Poof!” 

Ware turned in his Karcist’s oirdle 
and lifted his magician’s sword 
against Hess in both hands; but at 
the last minute, he seemed to be 
afraid to step out against the wob- 
bling figure of the sdenti'st. 

How GRACIOUS OF YOU TO SPEAK 



TO ME, AGAINST THE RULES. WE UN- 
DERSTAND, YOU AND I, THAT RXn.ES 
WERE MADE TO BE BROKEN. BUT 
YOUR FORM OF ADDRESS DOES NOT 
QUITE PLEASE ME. LET US PROLONG 
THE CONVERSATION, AND I WILL 
EDUCATE YOU. ETERNALLY, FOR A 
BEGINNING. 

Hess did not answer. Instead, he 
howled like a wolf and charged 
blindly out of the Grand Circle, his 
head down, toward the altar. The 
Sabbath Goat opened Its great 
mouth and gulped him down tike a 
fly. 

Thank you for the sacrifice. It 
said thickly. Anyone else? Then 
it is time I left. 

“Stand to, stupid and disobedient!” 
Fr. Domenico’s voice irang out from 
Baines’s right side. A doth ifiluttered 
out of the iDOdik’s oirde onto the 
floor. “Behcftd thy confusion, if

Pentacle of Soilomon which 1 have

NEVER IN THAT BOTTLE! 

“Hush and be still, fallen star.

The Saibbath Goat looked down 
upon Fr. Domenico almost kindly. 
His face red, Fr. Domenico reached 
into his robes and brought out a 
crucifex, which he thrust toward the 
altar like a sword. 

“Back to HeU, devil! In >the name 
of Christ our Lord!”

Ibe ivory cross exploded like a 
Prince Rupp’s Drop, strewing Fr. 
Domenico’s robe with dust. He look- 
ed down at his bomblly empty hands. 

Too LATE, MAGICIAN. EVEN THE 
BEST EFFORTS OF YOUR WHITE 

College also have failed — and 
AS THE Heavenly Hosts also will 
FAIL. We are aboard and aloose, 
AND WILL NOT BE PUT BACK. 

The great head bent to look down 
upon Theron Ware. 

And you are my dearly be- 
loved SON, IN WHOM I AM WELL 
PLEASED. I GO TO JOIN MY BROTHERS 
AND LOVERS IN THE REST OF YOUR 

WORK. But I shall be back for 
you; I SHALL BE BACK FOR YOU ALL. 

“One moment, please,” Fr. Do- 
menico said. “If you would be so 
kind ... I see that we have failed 
.... Would you tdl us: Where did 
we fail?” 

The Goat laughed, spoke three 
words, and vanished. 



T he dawn grew, red, streaked, 
duM, endless. From Ware’s 
window the sleeping town slumped 
down in rivers of cold lava toward 
the sea — but there was no sea; as 
Fr. Domenico had seen hours ago, 
the sea had withdrawn and would 
not be back again except as a tsuna- 
mi after the Cbrinth earthquake. 
Circles of desolation spread away 
from the ritual Circles. Inside them, 
the last magicians waited for the 
now Greatest Powers to come back 
for them. 

It would not be long now. In all 
their minds and hearts echoed those 
last three words. World without end. 
End without world. 

God is dead.

IF 






Dear Editor: 

It is my opinion tliat adults are 
discriminating against tihe younger 
generation of science-fiction readers. 
There are some adults who welcome 
a youth’s view of S.P., 'but they are 
few and far between. All others 
either ignore you or criticize the 
younger generation. They claim ours 
is but a passing interest unlike their 
eternal passion for science fiction. 
I may be only sixteen years old, but 
I have been reading S.P. for quite 
a while. I have coUeoted sixty pai>er- 
back stories and am a subscriber to 
IF, There is nothing I like better 
than reading one of the current 
works. I therefore believe that I too 
should have the right to be recog- 
nized as a S.F. afficionado. I would 
enjoy going to NYOON in Septem- 
ber, being only a short distance from 
New York, but I am deathly afraid 
of being, thrown out because of my 
age by the righteous and older fans. 
Is there any possibility of obtain- 
ing a safe-conduct pass? — Richard 
Kurzberg, 84 Crescent Avenue, Pas- 
saic, New Jersey. 

•All fans are welcome at all sf 
conventions — regardless of age, 
sex, color or creed. That’s one of the 
nice things about sf conventions! —

H U E / 

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

The most irritating letter I have 
ever read in any sf magazine was 
Alma McCormick’s April ’87 con- 
tribution. Why are so many people 



turned off science fiction? 

Absolutely not because the story 
has dropped to second place in favor 
of philosophy! The average person 
will not read sf because of the bad 



name it acquired in the **junk peri- 
od” of the 40’s, when sf did not 
teach. I disagree emphatically with 
her idea that the major purpose of 
sf is pure entertainment. 

In defense of the books that have 
“slid off the tracks where story 
comes first,” as Mrs, McCormick 
stated, I will offer the following list 
of titles. I defy anyone to say these 
books don’t entertain while at the 
same time allowing the reader to 
think: 

City, by Clifford D. Simak, The 
Martian Chronicles, by Ray Brad- 
bury, Stranger in a Strange Land, 
by Robert A. Heinledn, ChiMhood*s 
End, by Arthur C. cWke, A Can- 
ticle for Leihowitz, by Walter M. 
Miller, Jr., Davy, by Edgar Pang- 
bom, Brave New World, by Aidous 
Huxley, The Lord of the Rings, by 
J. R. R. Tolkien and Flowers for 
Algernon, by Daniel Keyes. 

Mr. Pohl, please don’t write what 
Mrs. McCormick considers a good 



161 




book. Make us think. Write an- 
other Plague of Pythons — write a 
book that teaches I — Frank Flynn, 
2418 Walker Lane, Holladay, Utah 
84117.

Dear Editor: 

I am not a letter writer, but I feel 
impelled to write by what I see you 
are hearing about the New Wave 
of British science fiction. This is 
very much a minority movement. 

The British magazines nearly col- 
lapsed because no one wanted them, 
and were saved by a subsidy obtain- 
ed when Brian Aldiss used his per- 
sonal prestige. 

The American magazines are in 
eV)(^ shop; the British ones can 
hiajdly be found. 1 personally am 
asibtamed that Britain should be iden- 
tified with them, and would like to 
remind you that the lunatic Bur- 
roughs came from your side of the 
AtlanticI! 

Please print this fast, before our 
national image is ruined! — D. C. 
Jackson, 322 Cromwell Road, London

Dear Editor: 

I think some comment should be 
made regarding the letter by Alma 
McCormick in your April issue. Mrs. 
McCormick seems quite dissatisfied 
with the science fiction being wrrit- 
ten today; 1 can only assume this is 
because i^e has been reading the 
wrong stories. Since I’m only eigh- 
teen, I can’t claim to be as widely 
read in the field as Mrs. McCormick. 
I do know one thing, however: The 
quality of sf today is excellent, and 
it’s getting better all the time. 

I find it hard to believe that such 
an obviously intelligent i)erson says 
today’s writers are trying to teach 
and neglecting the story. This just 



isn’t sol A story written for a to- 
tally didactic purpose would sell 
about as well as a snowball in Alas- 
ka. 

As a case in point, Mrs, McCor- 
mick refers to Heinlein’s The Moon 
Is a Harsh Mistress, This is prob- 
ably the best novel Heinlein has 
written in many a year. And why? 
Because the author is, as Mrs. Mc- 
Cormick puts it, busy playing sociol- 
ogy professor? Hardly! Because it’s 
a darned good story, that’s the rea- 
son. Mrs. McCormick is quite right 
when she says that the Heinlein who 
wrote The Puppet Masters, etc, is 
the same one who wrote The Moon 
Is a Harsh Mistress; except, that is, 
for the fact that Heinlein is a little 
more adept at story-telling than he 
once was. 

I couldn’t agree more with Samuel 
Goldwyn’s remark: “If you’ve gotta 
message, use Western Union.” How- 
ever, it just doesn’t apply here. May- 
be sf writers today are trying to 
teach; but certainly not to the ex- 
tent Mrs. McCormick would lead 
us to believe. 

Heinlein, Blish and Clarke are 
better than ever; and if the lady 
hasn’t seen a new Pohl in ages, I 
refer her to The Age of the Pussy- 
foot, in Galaxy^a 15th anniversary 
issue. Regarding her comments 
about today’s writers, I feel that 
Laumer, Zelazny, Niven, et-ah, are 
as good as anything the forties 
produced. 

Mrs. McCormick concludes by tell- 
ing you to write to “Write a good 
book for yourself”. Why doesn’t she 
write one? — Wayne Spiceland Jr., 
6054 Stillwood Dr. Nashville, Tenn. 
• That’s it for another month. This 
month’s “First” is Donald Walsh’s 
Mu Panther, Cramped for space — 
see you next month! — The Editor,

col- 
lapse. Its myriad worlds had already begun to 
war among themselves, plunging the universe 
into barbaric chaos. Civilization seemed doomed. 

But master scientists laboring to ensure that 
civilization would be preserved during the dark 
ages to come, established twin “Foundations” at 
opposite ends of the Galaxy, to form the nucleus 
of a new civilization, and in time to unite across 
the Galaxy to form a new ... a stronger ... a 
more enduring Second Empire. 

In Foundation and Foundation and Empire, 
we follow the course of the First Foundation as 
it rekindles the light of civilization in an ever- 
increasing portion of the Galaxy — and as it is 
confronted by its greatest crisis: a dangerous 
mutant, an evil yet brilliant psychopath whose 
soul-eonsuming detire is conquest of the Galaxy! 

Within a decade, he tyrannized the entire 
Galaxy - except for the Second Foundation. 
And this became his mania — to find and conquer 
the Second Foundation. Everything in the 
Galaxy must be his! ...
