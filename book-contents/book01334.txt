NO MORE TOMORROWS 



W th this issue we've combined 
Worlds of Tomorrow with If 
— and, as you've noticed, raised the 
price of If to 60c. 

We don't suppose there's much 
need to explain the rise in price, 
because we've all got pretty used 
to the fact that everything eternally 
costs more. (But you can avoid this 
particular price rise by subscribing 
now at the old rates — see ad else- 
where in this issue.) As long as the 
price had to go up anyway, we've 
taken this opportunity of bringing 
into If some of the most popular 
features from Worlds of Tomorrow 
— Philip Jose Farmer's Riverworld 
stories, Sam Moskowitz's articles 
and so on. We think If — which, 
as you know, already holds the Hu- 
go as the world's leading science- 
fiction magazine — will be even bet- 
ter for the change .... 

But Worlds of Tomorrow , alas, is 
with us no more. 

T he funny thing, about Worlds of 
Tomorrow is that at seemed to 
have every chance of surviving. 
Magazine publishing has become a 
chancy sort of business in the past 
decade or so, and the mortality 
tables for new publications are 
alarming. If you look at the circula- 
tion statements for even the titans 
of the field — Saturday Evening 
Post, Life, you name it — you can 
see the change. Where once a big 
slick magazine expected to sell half 
its copies on the newsstands and 
half by subscription, now 90% or 



more go by subscription. This isn't 
because subscription sales are more 
profitable; quite the reverse. In fact, 
the figures are rather astonishing: 
a big slick magazine whose single- 
copy price amounts to, say, {10 in 
a year will happily sell you a sub- 
scription for half that — and will 
pay $8 or {9 in list rental and mail- 
ing cost to get you to send in that 
five-dollar check I The freight is 
paid by advertising, of course. 

For nearly evejy magazine, 
though, the newsstand sales — the 
copies are bought by people like our- 
selves, browsing over the stacks in 
the comer drug store and buying 
what looks like it would be interest- 
ing to read — are harder and harder 
to come by. 

Worlds of Tomorrow, in its early 
issues, had a great deal of publicity, 
a friendly response from readers 
and a good sale — where it got on 
the stands at all. But that was the 
catch. Even after four years, it sim- 
ply was not getting out in some of 
the best parts of the country. 

Lacking the advertising subsidy 
that permits a big slick to lose 
money on every copy it sells and 
still come up smiling, the effort to 
stay afloat with a limited distribu- 
tion was too precarious to maintain. 
So — now we have If, enhanced 
with some of the best features of 
Worlds of Tomorrow, and Galaxy; 
and we'll just concentrate on con- 
tinuing to make them better and 
better!

FAUST 

ALEPH - NULL 

by JAMES BUSH 



Illustrated by Morrow 



There's no such thing as sorcery . 
But what was it, then, that turned 
fears to gold and destroyed lives? 



I 

T he magician said, “No, I can’t 
help you to persuade a woman. 
Should you want her raped, I can 
arrange that. If you want to rape 
her yourself, I can arrange that too, 
with more difficulty — possibly 
more than you’d have to exert on 



your own hook. But I can’t supply 
you with any philtres or formulae. 
My specialty is crimes of violence. 
Chiefly, murder.” 

Baines shot a sidelong glance at 
his special assistant, Jack Ginsberg, 
who as usual wore no expression 
whatsoever and had not a crease out 
of true. It was nice to be able to 



6 




FAUST ALEPH-NULL 



trust someone. Baines said: “You’re 
very frank.” 

“I try to leave as little mystery 
as possible,” Theron Ware — Baines 
knew that was indeed his real name 

— said promptly. “From the client’s 
point of view, black magic is a body 
of technique, like engineering. The 
more he knows about it, the easier 
I find it makes coming to an agree- 
ment.” 

66xto trade secrets? Arcane lore, 
and so on?” 

“Some — mostly the products of 
my own research, and very few of 
them of any real importance to 
you. The main scholium of magic 
is ‘arcane’ only because most peo- 
ple don’t know what books to read 
or where to find them. Given those 
books — and sometimes, somebody 
to translate them for you — you 
could learn almost everything im- 
portant that I know in a year. To 
make something of the material, of 
course, you’d have to have the talent, 
since magic is also an art. With 
books and the gift, you could be- 
come a magician — either you are 
or you aren’t, there are no bad 
magicians, any more than there is 
such a thing as a bad mathematician 

— in about twenty years. If it didn’t 
kill you first, of course, in some 
equivalent of a laboratory accident. 
It takes that long, give or take a 
few years, to develop the skills in- 
volved. I don’t mean to say you 
wouldn’t find it formidable, but the 
age of secrecy is past. And really 
the old codes were rather simple- 
minded, much easier to read than, 
say, musical notation. If they 



7 



weren’t, well, computers could break 
(them in a hurry. 9 ’ 

Most of these generalities were 
familiar stuff to Baines, as Ware 
doubtless knew. Baines suspected 
the magician of offering them in or- 
der to allow time for himself to be 
studied by the client. This suspicion 
crystallized promptly as a swinging 
door to the left of Ware’s huge 
desk opened silently, and a short- 
skirted blonde girl in a pageboy 
coiffure came in with a letter on a 
small silver tray. 

“Excuse me,” Ware said, taking 
the tray. “We wouldn’t have been 
interrupted if this weren’t impor- 
tant.” The envelope crackled expen- 
sively in his hands as he opened it. 

Baines watched the girl go out — 
a moving object, to be sure, but 
except that she reminded him vague- 
ly of someone else, nothing at all 
extraordinary — and then went 
openly about inspecting Ware. As 
usual, he started with the man’s 
chosen surroundings. 

T he magician’s office, brilliant in 
the afternoon sunlight, might 
have been the book-lined study of 
any doctor or lawyer, except that 
the room and the furniture were out- 
size. That said very little about 
Ware, for the house was a rented 
cliffside palazzo. There were big- 
ger ones available in Positano had 
Ware been interested in still higher 
ceilings and worse acoustics. 
Though most of the books looked 
©Id, the office was no mustier th an, 
say the library of Merton College, 
and it contained far fewer positive- 
ly ancient instruments. The only 
8 



trace in it which might have been 
attributable to magic was a faint 
smell of mixed incenses which the 
Tyrrhenian air coming in through 
the opened windows could not en- 
tirely dispell; but it was so slight 
that the nose soon tired of trying to 
detect it. Besides, it was hardly diag- 
nostic by itself. Small Italian church- 
es, for instance, also smelled like 
that. So did the drawing rooms of 
Egyptian police chiefs. 

Ware himself was remarkable, but 
with only a single exception, only 
in the sense that all men are unique 
to the eye of the bom captain. A 
small, spare man he was, dressed 
in natural Irish tweeds, a French- 
cuffed shirt linked with what looked 
like ordinary steel, a narrow gray 
silk four-in-hand tie with a single 
very small sapphire chessman — a 
rook — tacked to it. His leanness 
seemed to be held together with 
cables. Baines was sure that he was 
physically strong, despite a marked 
pallor, and that his belt size had 
not changed since he had been in 
high school. 

His present apparent age was de- 
ceptive. His face was seamed, and 
his bushy gray eyebrows now only 
slightly suggested that he had once 
been red-haired. His hair proper 
could not, for — herein lay his 
one marked oddity — he was ton- 
sured, like a monk, blue veins 
crawling across his bare white scalp 
as across the papery back of his 
hands. An innocent bystander might 
have taken him to be in his late 
sixties. Baines knew him to be exact- 
ly his own age, which was forty- 
eight. Black magic, not surprising- 

IF 




ly, was obviously a wearing pro- 
fession; cerebrotonic types like Ware, 
as Baines had often observed of 
the scientists who worked for Con- 
solidated Warfare Service (div. A. 
O. LeFebre et Cie.), ordinarily look 
about forty-five from a real age of 
thirty until their hair turns white, if 
a heart attack doesn’t knock them 
off in the interim. 

The parchment crackled, and Jack 
Ginsberg unobtrusively touched his 
dispatch case, setting going again 
a tape recorder back in Rome. Baines 
thought Ware saw this, but chose 
to take no notice. The magician said: 
“Of course, it’s also faster if my 
clients are equally frank with me.” 
“I should think you’d know all 
about me by now,” Baines said. He 
felt an inner admiration. The ability 
to pick up an interrupted conversa- 
tion exactly where it had been left 
off is rare in a man. Women do it 
easily, but seldom to any purpose. 

“Oh, Dun and Bradstreet,” Ware 
said, “newspaper morgues, and of 
course the grapevine — I have all 
that, naturally. But I’ll still need to 
ask some questions.” 

“Why not read my mind?” 
“Because it’s more work than it’s 
worth. I mean your excellent mind 
no disrespect, Mr. Baines. But one 
thing you must understand is that 
magic is hard work. I don’t use it 
out of laziness, I am not a lazy 
man, but by the same token I do 
take the easier ways of getting what 
I want if easier ways are available.” 
“You’ve lost me.” 

“An example, then. All magic — 
I repeat, all magic, with no excep- 
tions whatsoever — * depends upon 



the oontrol of demons. By demons 
I mean specifically fallen angels; no 
lesser class can do a thing for you. 
Now, I know one such whose Earth- 
ly form includes a long tongue. You 
may find the notion comic.” 

“Not exactly.” 

“Let that pass for now. In any 
event, this is also a great prince and 
president, whose apparition would 
cost me three days of work and two 
weeks of subsequent exhaustion. 
Shall I call him up to lick stamps 
for me?” 

“I see the point,” Baines said. 
“All right, ask your questions.” 
“Thank you. Who sent you to 
me?” 

U A medium in Bel Air — Los 
-Tx- Angeles. She (attempted to 
blackmail me, so nearly successful- 
ly that I concluded that she did have 
some real talent and would know 
somebody who had more. I threat- 
ened her life, and she broke.” 

Ware was taking notes. “I see. 
And she sent you to the Rosicru- 
cians?” 

“She tried, but I already knew 
that dodge. She sent me to Monte 
Albano.” 

“Ah. That surprises me, a little. 
I wouldn’t have thought that you’d 
have any need of treasure-finders.” 
“I do and I don’t,” Baines said. 
“I’ll explain that too, but a little 
later, if you don’t mind. Primarily 
I wanted someone in your specialty 
— murder — and of course the 
white monks were of no use there. 
I didn’t even broach the subject 
with them. Frankly, I only wanted 
to test your reputation, of which

I’d had hints; I too can use news- 
paper morgues. Their horror when 
I mentioned you was enough to con- 
vince me that I ought to talk to 
you, at least” 

“Sensible. Then you don’t really 
believe in magic yet — only in 
ESP or some such nonsense.” 

“I’m not,” Baines said guardedly, 
“a religious man.” 

“Precisely put. Hence, you want 
a demonstration. Did you bring with 
you the mirror I mentioned on the 
phone to your assistant?” 

Silently, — Jack took from his in- 
side jacket pocket a waxed-paper 
envelope, from which he in turn 
removed a lady’s hand-mirror sealed 
in glassine. He handed it to Baines, 
who broke the seal. 

“Good. Look in it.” 

Out of the comers of Baines’ eyes, 
two slow thick tears of dark venous 
blood were crawling down beside 
his nose. He lowered the mirror and 
stared at Ware. 

“Hypnotism,” he said, quite stead- 
ily. “I had hoped for better.” 

“Wipe them off,” Ware said, un- 
ruffled. 

Baines pulled out his immacu- 
late monogrammed handkerchief. 
On the white-on-white fabric, the 
red stains turned slowly into butter- 
yellow gold. 

“I suggest you take those to a 
government metallurgist tomorrow,” 
Ware said. “I could hardly have 
hypnotized him. Now peihaps we 
might get down to business.” 

“I thought you said — ” 

“ — that even the simplest trick 
requires a demon. So I did, and I 
meant it. He is sitting at your back 



now, Air. Baines, and he will be 
there until day after tomorrow at 
this hour.^ Remember that: day after 
tomorrow. It will cost me dearly 
to have turned this little piece of 
silliness, but I’m used to having to 
do such things for a skeptical client 
— and it will be included in my bill. 
Now, if you please, Mr. Baines, 
what do you want?” 

B aines handed the handkerchief 
to Jack, who folded it care- 
fully and put it back in its waxed- 
paper wrapper. “I,” Baines said, “of 
course want someone killed. Trace- 
lessly.” 

“Of course; but who?” 

“I’ll tell you that in a minute. 
First of all, do you exercise any 
scruples?” # 

“Quite a few,” Ware said. “For 
instance, I don’t kill my friends, 
not for any client. And possibly I 
might balk at certain strangers. How- 
ever, in general, I do have strangers 
sent for, on a regular scale of 
charges.” 

“Then we had better explore the 
possibilities,” Baines said. “I’ve got 
an ex-wife who’s a gross inconven- 
ience to me. Do you balk at that?” 
“Has she any children — by you 
or anybody else?” 

“No, none ait -all.” 

“In that case, there’s no prob- 
lem. For that kind of job, my stand- 
ard fee is fifteen thousand dollars, 
flat.” 

Despite himself, Baines stared in 
astonishment. “Is that all?” he said 
at last. 

“That’s all. I suspect that I’m al- 
most as wealthy as you are, Mr. 



10 



IF 




Baines. After all, I can find treasure 
as handily as the white monks can 
— indeed, a good deal better. I use 
these alimony cases to keep my 
name before the public. Financially 
they’re a loss to me.” 

“What kinds of fees are you in- 
terested in?” 

“I begin to exert myself slightly 
at about five million.” 

If this man was a charlatan, he 
was a grandiose one. Baines said, 
“Let’s stick to the alimony case for 
the moment. Or rather, suppose I 
don’t care about the alimony, as in 
fact I don’t. Instead, I might not 
only want her dead, but I might want 
her to die badly. To suffer.” 

“I don’t charge extra for that.” 
“Why not?” 

“Mr. Baines,” Ware said pa- 
tiently, “I remind you, please, that 
I myself am not a killer. I merely 
summon and direct the agent. I think 
it very likely — in fact, it is beyond 
doubt — (that any patient I have 
sent for dies in an access of horror 
and agony beyond your power to 
imagine, or even mine. But you did 
specify that you wanted your mur- 
der done ‘tracelessly,’ which obvious- 
ly means that I must have no un- 
usual marks left on the patient. I 
prefer it that way myself. How 
then could I prove suffering if you 
asked for it, in a way inarguable 
enough to charge you extra for it? 

“Or, look at the other side of the 
shield, Mr. Baines. Every now and 
then, an unusual divorce client asks 
that the ex-consort be carried away 
painlessly, even sweetly, out of some 
residue of sentiment. I could col- 
lect an extra fee fo£ that, on a con- 



tingent basis, that is, if the body 
turns out to show no overt marks 
of disease or violence. But my agents 
are demons. Sweetness is not a trait 
they can be compelled to exhibit; 
so I never accept that kind of con- 
dition from a client, either. Death is 
what you pay for, and death is 
what you get. The circumstances are 
up to the agent, and I don’t offer 
my clients anything that I know I 
can’t deliver.” 

“All right, I’m answered,” Baines 
said. “Forget Dolores — actually 
she’s only a minor nuisance, and only 
one of several, for that matter. Now 
let’s talk about the other end of 
the spectrum. Suppose instead that 
I should ask you to . send for 
... a great political figure. Say, 
the governor of California. Or, if 
he’s a friend of yours, pick a similar 
figure who isn’t.” 

Ware nodded. “He’ll do well 
enough. But you’ll recall that I 
asked you about children. Had you 
really turned out to have been an 
alimony case, I should next have 
asked you about surviving relatives. 
My fees rise in direct proportion to 
the numbers and kinds of people a 
given death is likely to affect. This 
is partly what you call scruples, and 
partly a species of self-defense. Now 
in the case of a reigning governor, I 
would charge you one dollar for 
every vote he got when he was last 
elected. Plus expenses, of course. 

B aines whistled in admiration. 

“You’re the first man I’ve ever 
met who’s worked out a system to 
make scruples pay. And I can see 
why you don’t care about alimony

cases. Some day, Mr. Ware — ” 
“Doctor Ware, please. I am a 
Doctor of Theology.” 

“Sorry. I only meant to say that 
some day I’ll ask you why you 
want so much money; you asthenics 
seldom can think of any good use 
for it. In the meantime, however, 
you’re hired. Is it all payable in 
advance?” 

“The expenses are payable in ad- 
vance; the fee is C.O.D. As you’ll 
realize once you stop to think about 
it, Mr. Baines — ” 

“Dr. Baines. I am an LL.D.” 
“Apologies in exchange. I want 
you to realize, after these courtesies, 
that I have never, never been bilk- 
ed.” 

Baines thought about what was 
supposed to be at his back until 
day after tomorrow. Pending the 
test of the golden tears on the hand- 
kerchief, he was willing to believe 
that he should not try to cheat Ware. 
Actually, he had never planned to. 

“Good,” he said, getting up. “By 
the same token, we don’t need a 
contract. I agree to your terms.” 
“But what for?” 

“Oh,” Baines said, “we can use 
the Governor of California for a 
starter. Jack here will iron out any 
remaining details with you; I have 
to get back to Rome by tonight.” 
“You did say, ‘For a starter?’ ” 
Baines nodded shortly. Ware, also 
rising, said: “Very well.' I shall ask 
no questions. But in fairness, Mr. 
Baines, I should warn you that on 
your next commission of this kind, 
I shall ask you what you want.” 

“By that time,” Baines said, hold- 
ing his excitement tightly bottled, 



“we’ll have to exchange such confi- 
dences. Oh, Dr. Ware; will the, uh, 
demon on my back go away by 
itself when the time r s up, or must I 
see you again to get it taken off?” 
“It isn’t on your back,” Ware 
said. “And it will go away by it- 
self. Marlowe to the contrary, mis- 
ery does not love company.” 
Baring his teeth, Baines said, 
“We’ll see about that.” 

II 

F or a moment, Jack Ginsberg felt 
the same soon-to-be-brief 
strangeness of the man who does 
not really know what is going on 
and hence thinks he might be about 
to be fired. It was as though some- 
thing had swallowed him by mis- 
take, and — quite without malice — 
was about to throw him up again. 

While he waited for the monster’s 
nausea to settle out, Jack went 
through his rituals, stroking his 
cheeks for stubble, resettling his 
creases, running through last week’s 
accounts, and thinking above all, as 
he usually did most of all in such 
interims, of what the new girl might 
look like squatting in her stockings. 
Nothing special, probably. The 
reality was almost always hedged 
around with fleshly inconveniences 
and piddling little preferences which 
could flense away at will from the 
clean vision. 

When the chief had left and 
Ware had come back to his desk, 
however, Jack was ready for busi- 
ness and thoroughly on top of it. 
He prided himself upon an abso- 
lute self-control. 

“Questions?” Ware said.

“A few, Doctor Ware. You men- 
tioned expenses. What expenses?” 
“Chiefly travel,” Ware said. “I 
have to see the patient, personally. 
In the case Doctor Baines posed, 
that involves a trip to California, 
which is a vast inconvenience to 
me, and goes on the bill. It includes 
air-fare, hotels, meals, other put-of- 
pocket expenses which I’ll itemize 
when the mission is over. Then 
there’s the question of getting to see 
the governor. I have colleagues in 
California, but there’s a certain 
amount of influences I’ll have to 
buy, even with the help of Con- 
solidated Warfare — munitions and 
magic are circles which don’t in- 
tersect very effectively. On the 
whole, I think a draft for ten 
thousand would be none too large.” 
All that for magic. Disgusting. 
But the chief believed in it, at least 
provisionally. It made Jack feel very 
queasy. 

“That sounds very satisfactory,” 
he said, but he made no move to- 
ward the corporate checkbook; he 
was not about to issue any Valen- 
tines to strangers yet, not until there 
was more love touring about the 
landscape than he had felt in his 
crew-cut antennae. “We’re natur- 
ally a little bit wondering, sir, why 
all this expense is necessary. We un- 
derstand that you’d rather not ride 
a demon when you can fly a jet 
with less effort — ” 

“I’m not sure you do,” Ware said, 
“but stop simpering about it and 
ask me about the money.” 

“Argh .... Well, sir, then, just 
why do you live outside the United 
States? We know you’re still a citi- 
zen. And after all, we have freedom 
14 



of religion in the States still. Why 
does the chief have to pay to ship 
you back home for one job?” 
“Because I’m not a common gun- 
man,” Ware said. “Because I don’t 
care to pay income taxes, or even 
report my income to anybody. There 
are two reasons. For the benefit of 
your ever-attentive dispatch-case 
there — since you’re a deaf ear if 
I ever saw one — if I lived in the 
United States and advertised myself 
as a magician, I would be charged 
with fraud. And if I successfully 
defended myself — proved I was 
what I said I was — I’d wind up in 
a gas chamber; if I failed to de- 
fend myself, I’d be just one more 
charlatan. In Europe, I can -say I’m 
a magician and be left alone if I can 
satisfy my clients; caveat emptor. 
Otherwise, I’d have to be constantly 
killing off petty politicians and ac- 
countants, which isn’t worth the 
work and sooner or later runs into 
the law of diminishing returns. Now 
you can turn that thing off.” 

A ha; there was something wrong 
with this joker. He was preying 
upon superstition. As a Reformed 
Orthodox Agnostic, Jack Ginsberg 
knew all the ins and outs of that, 
specially the double-entry sides. He 
said smoothly: 

“I quite understand. But don’t 
you perhaps have almost as much 
trouble with the Church, here in 
Italy, as you would with the gov- 
ernment back home?” 

“No, not under a liberal Ponti- 
ficate. The modern Church discour- 
ages what it calls superstition among 
its adherents. I haven’t encountered 

IP 




a prelate in decades who believes in 
the literal existence of demons — 
though of course some of the Or- 
ders know better.” 

‘To be sure,” Jack said, spring- 
ing his trap exultantly. “So I think, 
sir, that you may be overcharging 
us — and haven’t been quite candid 
with us. If you do indeed control 
all these great princes and presidents, 
you could as easily bring the chief a 
woman as you could bring him a 
treasure or a murder.” 

“So I could,” the magician said, a 
little wearily. “I see you’ve done 
a little reading. But I explained to 
Doctor Baines, and I explain again 
to you, that I specialize only in 
crimes of violence. Now, Mr. Gins- 
berg, I think you were about to 
write me an expense check.” 

“So I was.” But still he hesitated. 
At last Ware said with delicate po- 
liteness: 

“Is there some other doubt I 
could resolve for you, Mr. Gins- 
berg? I am, after all, a Doctor of 
Theology. Or perhaps you have a 
private commission you wish to 
broach to me?” 

“No,” Jack said. “No, not exact- 
ly.” 

“I see no reason why you should 
be shy. It’s clear that you like my 
lamia. And in fact, she’s quite free 
of the nuisances of human women 
which annoy you — ” 

“Damn you. I thought you read 
minds! You lied about that too.” 
“I don’t read minds, and I never 
lie,” Ware said. “But I’m adept 
at reading faces and somatotypes. 
It saves me a lot of trouble and 
a lot of unnecessary magic. Do 



you want the creature or don’t you7 
I could have her sent to you in- 
visibly if you like.” 

“No.” 

“Not invisibly. I’m sorry for you. 
Well then, my godless and lustless 
friend, speak up for yourself. What 
would you like? Your business is 
long since done. Spit it out. What is 
it?” 

For a breathless instant, Jack al- 
most said what it was, but the 
God in which he no longer be- 
lieved was at his back. He Baade 
out the check and handed it over. 
The girl (no, not a girl), came in 
and took it away. 

“Good-bye,” Theron Ware said. 

Jack had missed the boat again. 

Ill 

F ather F. X. Domenico Bruno 
Garelli read the letter again, 
hopefully. Father Uccello affected 
an Augustinian style, after his name- 
saint, full of rare words and out- 
right neologisms imbedded in med- 
ieval syntax. As a stylist Fr. Dom- 
enico much preferred Roger Bacon, 
but that eminent anti-magician, not 
being a Father of the Church, tempt- 
ed few imitators — and it was possi- 
ble that Fr. Domenico had misread 
him. But no. Involuted though the 
Latin of the letter was, the sense, 
this time, was all too plain. 

Fr. Domenico sighed. The prac- 
tice of ceremonial magic, at least 
of the white kind which was the 
monastery’s sole concern, seemed 
to be becoming increasingly unre- 
warding. Part of the difficulty, of 
course, lay in the fact that the 



FAUST ALEPH-NULL 



15 




chiefest traditional use (for profit) 
of white magic was the finding of 
buried treasure; and after centuries 
of unremitting practice by centuries 
of sorcerers black and white, plus 
the irruption into the field of such 
modem devices as the mine-detector, 
there was very little buried treasure 
left to find. Of late, the troves re- 
vealed by those under the govern- 
ments of Och and Bethor — with 
the former of whom in particular lay 
the bestowal of “a purse springing 
with gold” — had increasingly turn- 
ed out to be underseas, or in places 
like Fort (Knox or a Swiss bank, 
making the recovery enterprises so 
colossal and mischancy as to remove 
all possibility of profit for client and 
monastery alike. 

On the whole, black magicians 
had an easier time of it — at least 
in this life; one must never forget, 
Fr. Domenico reminded himself 
hastily, that they were also damned 
eternally. It was as mysterious as 
it had always 'been that such infer- 
nal spirits as Lucifuge Rofocale 
should be willing to lend so much 
power to a mortal whose soul Hell 
would almost inevitably have won 
anyhow, considering the character 
of the average sorcerer, and consid- 
ering how easily such pacts could 
be voided at the last instant; and 
that God would allow such demonic 
malice to be vented through the 
sorcerer upon the innocent. But that 
was simply another version of the 
Problem of Evil, for which the 
Church had long had the answer 
(or the dual answer) of free will 
and original sin. 

It had to be recalled, too, that 



even the practice of white or Trans- 
cendental magic was officially a mor- 
tal sin, fpr the modem Church held 
that all trafficking with spirits — 
including the unfallen, since such 
dealings inevitably assumed the an- 
gels to be demiurges and other Kab- 
balistic semi-deities — wias an ab- 
omination, regardless of intent. Once 
upon a time, it had been recognized 
that (barring the undertaking of an 
actual pact) only a man of the high- 
est piety, of the highest purpose, and 
in the highest state of ritual and 
spiritual purification could hope to 
summon and control a demon, let 
alone an angel; but there had been 
too many lapses of intent, and then 
of act. In both practicality and com- 
passion the Church had declared all 
Theurgy to be anathema, reserving 
unto itself only one negative aspect 
of magic — exorcism — and that 
only under the strictest of canoni- 
cal limitations. 

M onte Albano had a special dis- 
pensation, to be sure — partly 
since the monks had at one time 
been so spectacularly successful in 
nourishing the coffers of St. Peter’s; 
partly because the knowledge to be 
won through the Transcendental rit- 
uals might sometimes be said to have 
nourished the soul of the Rock; and, 
in small part, because under the 
rarest of circumstances white magic 
had been known to prolong the life 
of the body. But these fountains (to 
shift the image) were now showing 
every sign of running dry. Hence 
the dispensation might be withdrawn 
at any time — thus closing out the 
last sanctuary of white magic.

IF 




That would leave -the field to the 
black magicians. There were no 
black sanctuaries, except for the 
Parisian Brothers of the Left-Hand 
Way, who were romantics of the 
school of Eliphas Levi and were 
more to be pitied for folly then 
condemned for evil. But of solitary 
black sorcerers there was still a 
disconcerting number — though 
even one would be far too many. 

Which brought Fr. Domenico di- 
rectly back to the problem of the 
letter. 

He sighed, turned away from his 
lectrum and padded off — the broth- 
ers of Monte Albano were discalced 
— toward the office of the Director, 
letter in hand. Father Umberto was 
in (of course he was always physi- 
cally in, like all the rest of them, 
since the Mount could not be left, 
once entered, except by the laity 
and they only by muleback), and Fr. 
-Domenico got to the point directly. 

“I’ve had another impassioned 
screed from our witch-smeller,” he 
said. “I am beginning to consider, 
reluctantly, -that the matter is at 
least as serious as he’s been saying 
all along.” 

“You mean the matter of Theron 
Ware, I presume.” 

“Yes, of course. That American 
gun-maker we saw went directly 
from the Mount to Ware, as seem- 
ed all too likely even at the time. 
Father Uccello says that there’s now 
every sign of another series of send- 
ings being prepared in Positano.” 

“I wish you could avoid these 
alliterations. They make it difficult 
to discover what you’re talking 
about. I often feel that a lapse 



into alliteration or other grammatical 
trick is a sure sign that the speaker 
isn’t himself quite sure of what he 
means to say and is trying to blind 
me to the fact. Never mind. As for 
the demonolater Ware, Ve are in 
no position to interfere with him, 
whatever he’s preparing.” 

“The style is Father Uccello’s. 
Anyhow, he insists that we must 
interfere. He has been practicing 
divination — so you can see how 
seriously he takes this, the old purist 
of Ware and Baines presages some- 
— and he says that his principal, 
whom he takes great pains not to 
identify, told him that the meeting 
thing truly monstrous for the world 
at large. According to his informa- 
tion, all Hell has been waiting for 
this meeting since the two of diem 
were bom.” 

“I suppose he’s sure his principal 
wasn’t in a fact a demon and didn’t 
slip a lie past him, or at least one 
of their usual brags? As you’ve just 
indirectly pointed out, Father Uc- 
cello is way out of practice.” 

F ather Domenico spread his hands. 

“Of course I can’t answer that. 
Though if you wish, Father, I’ll 
try to summon Whatever it was 
myself, and put the problem to It. 
But you know how good the chances 
are that I’ll get the wrong one — 
and how hard it is to ask the right 
question. The great Governors seem 
to have no time sense as we under- 
stand the term. And as for demons, 
well, even when compelled they 
often really don’t seem to know 
what’s going on outside their own 
jurisdictions.” 



FAUST ALEPH-NULL 



17 




“Quite so,” said the Director, 
who had not himself practiced in 
many years. He had been greatly 
.talented once, but the loss of gifted 
experimenters to administrative 
posts was the curse of all research 
organizations. “I think it best that 
you don’t jeopardize your own use- 
fulness, and your own soul of course, 
in calling up some spirit you can’t 
name. Father Uccello in turn ought 
to know that there’s nothing we can 
do about Ware. Or does he have 
some proposal?” 

“He wants us,” Fr. Domenico 
said in a slightly shaky voice, “to 
impose an observer on Ware. To 
send one directly to Positano, some- 
one who’ll stick to Ware until we 
know what the deed is going to be. 
We’re just barely empowered to do 
this — whereas of course Father 
Uccello can’t. The question is, do 
we want to?” 

“Hmm, hmm,” the Director said. 
“Obviously not. That would bank- 
rupt us — oh, not financially, of 
course, though it would be difficult 
enough. But we couldn’t afford to 
send a novice. Or indeed anyone 
less than the best we have. And after 
the good Lord only knows how 
many months in that infernal at- 
mosphere . ” 

The sentence trailed off, as the 
Director’s sentences often did, but 
Father Domenico no longer had 
any difficulty in completing them. 
Obviously the Mount could not af- 
ford to have even one of its best 
operators incapacitated — the word, 
in fact, was “contaminated” — by 
prolonged contact with the person 
and effects of Theron Ware. Similar- 



ly, Father Domenico was reasonably 
certain that the Director would in 
fact send somebody to Positaao. 
Otherwise he would not have mount- 
ed the obvious objections, but simply 
dismissed the proposal. For all their 
usual amusement with Father Uc- 
cello, both men knew that there 
were occasions when one had to 
take him with the utmost serious- 
ness and that this was one of them. 

“Nevertheless the matter will need 
to be explored,” the Director re- 
sumed after a moment, fingering his 
beads. “I had better give Ware the 
usual formal notification. We’re not 

obligated to follow up on it, but 
»» 

“Quite,” Fr. Domenico said. He 
put the letter into his scrip and 
arose. “I’ll hear from you, then, 
when a reply’s been received from 
Ware. I’m glad you agree that the 
matter is serious.” 

After another exchange of for- 
malities, he left, head bowed. He 
also knew well enough whom the 
Director would send, without any 
intervention of false modesty to 
cloud the issue; and he was well 
aware that he was terrified. 

He went directly to his conjuring 
room, a cluttered tower chamber 
which no one else could use — 
for magic is intensely sensitive to 
the personality of the operator — 
and still faintly redolent of a scent 
a little like oil of lavender, a trace 
of his last use of the room. Mansit 
odor, posses scire duisse deam, he 
thought, not for the first time; 
but he had no intention of summon- 
ing any Presence now. Instead, he 
crossed to the chased casket which 



18 



IF 




contained his 1606 copy — the 
second edition, but not much cor- 
rupted — of the Enchiridion of 
Leo III, that odd collection of pray- 
ers and other devices “effectual 
against all the perils to which every 
sort and condition of men may 
be made subject on land, on water, 
from open and secret enemies, from 
the bitter bites of wild and rabid 
beasts, from poisons, from fire, from 
tempests.” For greatest effective- 
ness he was instructed to carry the 
book on his person, but he had 
seldom judged himself to be in 
sufficient peril to risk so rare and 
valuable an object. In any event 
he did always read at least one 
page daily, chiefly the In principio, a 
version of the first chapter of the 
gospel according to St. John. 

Now he took the book out and 
opened it to the Seven Mysterious 
Orisons, the only section of the work 
— without prejudice to the efficacy 
of the rest of it — which probably 
had indeed proceeded from the hand 
of the Pope of Charlemagne. Kneel- 
ing to face the east. Fr. Domenico, 
without looking at the page, began 
the prayer appropriate for Thurs- 
day, at the utterance of which, per- 
haps by no coincidence, it is said 
that “the demons flee away.”

C onsiderable business awaited 
Baines in Rome, all the more 
pressing because Jack Ginsberg was 
still out of town. Baines made no 
special effort to hunt down Jack’s 
report on what the government met- 
allurgist had said about the golden 



FAUST ALEPH-NULL 




tears amid the mass of other papers. 
For the time being, at least, Baines 
regarded the report as personal cor- 
respondence, and he had a stand- 
ing rule never even to open person- 
al letters during office hours, 
whether he was actually in an of- 
fice or, as now, working out of a 
hotel room. 

Nevertheless, the report came to 
the surface the second day that he 
was back to work; and since he also 
made it a rule never to lose time to 
the distractions of an unsatisfied 
curiosity if an easy remedy was to 
hand, he read it. The tears on the 
handkerchief were indeed 24-karat 
gold; worth about eleven cents, tak- 
en together, on the current market, 
but to Baines representing an enor- 
mous investment (or, looked at an- 
other way, a potential investment in 
enormity.) 

He put it aside with satisfaction 
and promptly forgot about it. Or 
very nearly. Investments in enormi- 
ty were his stock in trade, though 
of late, he thought again with cold 
anger, they had been paying less 
and less — hence his interest in 
Ware, which the other directors of 
Consolidated Warfare Service would 
have considered simple insanity. But 
after all, if the business was no 
longer satisfying, it was only nat- 
ural to seek analogous satisfactions 
somewhere else. An insane man, in 
Baines’ view, would be one who 
tried to substitute some pleasure — 
women, philanthropy, art collecting, 
golf — which offered no cognate 
satisfaction at all. Baines was ardent 
about his trade, which was destruc- 
tion. Golf could no more have sub- 



limated that passion than it could 
have diluted that of a painter or a 
kcher. • 

The current fact, which had to be 
faced and dealt with, was that nuc- 
lear weapons had almost totally 
spoiled the munitions business. Oh, 
there was still a thriving trade to 
be drummed up selling small arms 
to a few small new nations — small 
arms being defined arbitrarily as 
anything up to the size of a sub- 
marine. Hydrogen fusion and the 
ballistic missile made the really ma- 
jor achievements of the art, the 
lubrication of the twenty-year cycle 
of world wars, entirely too oblit- 
erative and self-defeating. These 
days, Baines kind of diplomacy con- 
sisted dhiefly in the fanning of 
brush-fires and civil wars. Even this 
was a delicate business. The na- 
tionalism game was increasingly an 
exceedingly confused affair, in 
which one could never be quite sure 
whether some emergent African 
state, with a population about the 
size of Maplewood, N.J., would not 
turn out to be of absorbing interest 
to one or more of the nuclear 
powers. (Some day, of course, they 
would all be nuclear powers, and 
then the art would become as 
formalized and minor as flower- 
arranging.) 

The very delicacy of this kind 
of operation had its satisfactions, in 
a way, and Baines was good at it. 
In addition, Consolidated Warfare 
Service had several thousand man- 
years of accumulated experience at 
this sort of thing upon which he 
could call. One of the CW’s chiefest 
specialists was in Rome with him

now: Dr. Adolph Hess, famous as 
the designer of (that peculiar all- 
purpose vehicle called the Hessicop- 
ter, but of interest in the present 
negotiations instead as the inventor 
of something nobody was supposed 
to have heard of: the land torpe- 
do, a rapidly burrowing device 
which might show up, commendably 
anonymous, under any installation 
within two hundred miles of its 
launching tunnel, geology permit- 
ting. Baines had guessed that it 
might be especially attractive to at 
least one of the combatants in the 
Yemeni insurrection. He had proven 
to be so right that he was now 
trying hard not to have to dicker 
with all four of them. This was all 
the more difficult because, although 
the two putative Yemeni factions 
accounted for very little, Nasser 
was nearly as shrewd as Baines was, 
and Faisal inarguably a good deal 
shrewder. 

N evertheless, Baines was not es- 
sentially a miniaturist, and he 
was well aware of it. He had rec- 
ognized the transformation impend- 
ing in the trade early on, in fact 
with the publication in 1950 by the 
U.S. Government Printing Office of 
a volume titled The Effects of 
Atomic Weapons, and as soon as 
possible had engaged the services 
of a private firm called the Mama- 
roneck Research Institute. This was 
essentially a brainstorming organi- 
zation, started by an alumnus of 
the RAND Corporation, which spe- 
cialized in imagining possible poli- 
tical and military confrontations and 
their possible outcomes, some of 



them so outre as to require the sub- 
contracting of free-lance science- 
fiction writers. From the files of 
CWS and other sources, Baines fed 
Mamaroneck materials for its com- 
puters, some of which material 
would have considerably shaken the 
governments who thought they were 
sitting on it. In return, Mamaroneck 
fed Baines long, neatly lettered and 
Xeroxed reports bearing such titles 
as “Short- and Long-Term Probabili- 
ties Consequent to an Israeli Block- 
ade of the Faeroe Islands.” 

Baines winnowed out the most 
obviously absurd of these, but with 
a care which was the very opposite 
of conservatism, for some of the 
strangest proposals could turn out 
upon second look to be not ab- 
surd at all. Those which offered 
the best combination of surface ab- 
surdity with hidden plausibility, he 
set out to translate into real sit- 
uations. Hence there was really noth- 
ing illogical or even out of character 
in his interest in Theron Ware, for 
Baines, too, practiced what was lit- 
erally an occult art in which the 
man on the street didn’t believe. 

The buzzer sounded twice; Gins- 
berg was back. Baines returned the 
signal and the door swung open. 

“Rogan’s dead,” Jack said with- 
out preamble. 

“That was fast. I thought it was 
going to take Ware a week after 
he got back from the States.” 

“It’s been a week,” Jack re- 
minded him. 

“Hmm? So it has. Waiting around 
for these Ayrabs to get off the 
dime is hard on the time sense. Well, 
well. Details?”

“Only what’s come over the Reu- 
ters ticker, so far. Started as pneu- 
monia, ended as cor pulmonale — 
heart failure from too much cough- 
ing. It appears that he had a small 
mitral murmur for years. Only the 
family knew about, and his physi- 
cians assured them that it wasn’t 
dangerous if he didn’t try to run 
a four-minute mile or something 
like that. Now the guessing is that 
the last campaign put a strain on 
it, and the pneumonia did the rest.” 

“Very clean,” Baines said. 

He thought about the matter for 
a while. He had borne the late 
governor of California no ill will. 
He had never met the man, nor had 
any business conflicts with him and 
in fact had rather admired his brand 
of medium-right-wing politics, 
which had been of the articulate but 
inoffensive sort expectable of an ex- 
account executive for a San Fran- 
cisco advertising agency specializing 
in the touting of cold breakfast 
cereals. Indeed, Baines recalled sud- 
denly from the file biography, Rogan 
had been a fraternity brother of his. 

Nevertheless he was pleased. Ware 
had done the job — Baines was not 
in the smallest doubt that Ware 
should have the credit — with great 
nicety. After one more such trial 
run, simply to rule out all possibility 
of coincidence, he should be ready 
-to tackle something larger; possibly, 
the biggest job of them all. 

Baines wondered how it had been 
done. Was it possible that a demon 
could appear to a victim in the form 
of a pneumococcus? If so, what 
about the problem of reproduction? 
Well, there had been the appearances 



all over medieval Europe of frag- 
ments of the True Cross, in num- 
bers quantitatively sufficient to stock 
a large lumberyard. Contemporary 
clerical apologists had called that 
Miraculous Multiplication, which 
had aways seemed to Baines to be 
a classic example of rationalizing 
away the obvious; but since magic 
was real, maybe Miraculous Multi- 
plication was, too. 

These, however, were merely de- 
tails of technique, in which he made 
a practice of taking no interest. 
That kind of thing was for hire- 
lings. Still, it wouldn’t hurt to have 
somebody in the organization who 
did know something about the tech- 
nicalities. It was often dangerous 
to depend solely on outside ex- 
perts. 

U TV Take out a check for Ware,” 

1V1 he told Jack. “From my 
personal account. Call it a consulta- 
tion fee — medical, preferably. 
When you send it to him, set up 
a date for another visit — let’s see 
— as soon as I get back from Ri- 
yadh. I’ll take up all this other 
business with you in about half 
an hour. Send Hess in, but wait 
outside.” 

Jack nodded and left. A moment 
later, Hess entered silently. He was 
a tall, bony man with a slight pod, 
bushy eyebrows, a bald spot in the 
back, pepper-and-salt hair and a 
narrow jaw which made his face 
look nearly triangular. 

“Any interest in sorcery, Adolph? 
Personal, I mean?” 

“Sorcery? I know something 
about it. For all the nonsense in-

volved, it was highly important in 
the history of science, particularly 
the alchemical side, and the astro- 
logical.” 

“I’m not interested in either of 
those. I’m talking of black magic. 

“Then, no, I don’t know much 
about it,” Hess said. 

“Well, you’re about to learn. 
We’re going to visit an authentic 
sorcerer in about two weeks. I want 
you to study his methods.” 

“Are you pulling my leg?” Hess 
said. “No, you never do that. Are 
we going into the business of ex- 
posing charlatans, then? I’m not 
sure I’m the best man for that, 
Baines. A professional stage magi- 
cian — a Houdini type — would 
be more apt to catch a faker than I.” 
“No, that’s not the issue at all. 
I’m going to ask this man to do 
some work for me, in his own line, 
and I need a close observer to see 
what he does — not to see through 
it, but to form an accurate impres- 
sion of the procedures, in case some- 
thing should go sour with the rela- 
tionship later on.” 

“But — well, if you say so, Baines. 
It does seem rather a waste of time.” 
“Not to me,” Baines said. “While 
you’re waiting to talk to the Sau- 
dis with me, read up on the sub- 
ject. By the end of a year, I want 
you to know as much about the sub- 
ject as an expert. The man hims elf 
told me that that’s possible even 
for me, so it shouldn’t tax you any.” 
“It’s not likely to tax my brains 
much,” Hess said drily, “but it may 
be a considerable tax on by pa- 
tience. However, you’re the boss.” 
“Right. Get on it.”* 



Hess nodded distantly to Jack as 
he went out The two men did not 
like each other much, in pant, Baines 
sometimes thought, because in some 
ways they were much alike. When 
the door had closed behind the 
scientist, Jack produced from his 
pocket the waxed-paper envelope 
which had contained, and obviously 
still contained, the handkerchief 
bearing the two transmuted tears. 

“I don’t need that,” Baines said. 
“I’ve got your report. Throw that 
thing away; I don’t want anybody 
asking what it means.” 

“I will,” Jack said. “But first, 
you’ll remember that Ware said that 
the demon would leave you after 
two days.” 

“Sure. Why?” 

“Look at this.” 

Jack took out the handkerchief 
and spread it on Baines’ blotter. 

On the Irish linen, where the 
golden tears had been, were now 
two dull, inarguable smears of lead. 

V 

B y some untraceable miscalcula- 
tion, Baines’ party arrived in 
Riyadh precisely at the beginning of 
Ramadan, during which the Arabs 
fasted all day and were consequent- 
ly in too short a temper to do busi- 
ness with, which was followed, after 
nine solid days, by a three-day 
feast during which they' were too 
stuperous to do business with. Once 
negotiations were properly opened, 
however, they took no more than 
the two weeks Baines anticipated. 

Since the Moslem calendar is lun- 
ar, Ramadan is a moveable festival,

which this year fell close to Christ- 
mas. Baines half suspected that 
Theron Ware would refuse to see 
him in so inauspicious a season 
for servants of Satan, but Ware 
made no objection, remarking only 
(by post), “December 25th is a 
celebration of great antiquity.” 

Hess, who had been reading duti- 
fully, interpreted Ware to mean that 
Christ had not actually been born 
on that date — “though in this 
universe of discourse I can’t see 
what difference that makes,” he said. 
“If the word ‘superstition’ has any 
of its old meaning left at all by 
now, it means that the sign has 
come to replace the thing. Or in 
other words, that facts come to 
mean what we say they mean.” 

“Call it an observer effect,” 
Baines suggested, not entirely joking. 
He was not disposed to argue the 
point with either of them. Ware 
would see him, that’s what counted. 

But if the season was no ap- 
parent inconvenience to Ware, it 
was a considerable one to Fr. Dom- 
enico, who at first flatly refused to 
celebrate it in the very maw of Hell. 
He was pressed at length and from 
both sides by the Director and Fr. 
Ucello. 

Mustering all his humility, obedi- 
ence and resignation — his courage 
seemed to have evaporated — he 
trudged forth from the monastery, 
dispensed for sandals and mounted 
a mule, the Enchiridion of Leo III 
swinging from his neck under his 
cassock in a new leather bag, and a 
selection of his thaumaturgic tools, 
newly exorcised, asperged, fumigat- 
ed and wrapped in silken cloths, in 



a satchel balanced carefully on the 
mule’s neck. It was a hushed leave- 
taking — all the more so in its lack 
of any formalities or even witnesses, 
for only the Director knew why 
he was going, and he had been re- 
strained with difficulty from bruit- 
ing it about that Fr. Domenico had 
been expelled, to make a cover-story. 

T he practical effect of both de- 
lays was that Fr. Domenico and 
Baines’ party arrived at Ware’s pal- 
azzo on the same day, in the midst 
of the only snowstorm Positano had 
seen in seven years. As a spiritual 
courtesy — for protocol was all- 
important in such matters, other- 
wise neither monk nor sorcerer 
would have dared to confront the 
other — Fr. Domenico was received 
first, briefly but punctiliously; but 
as a client, Baines (and his crew, in 
descending order) got the best quar- 
ters. 

As was customary in southern 
Italy at this time, three masked kings 
came to the gate of the palazzo to 
bring and ask presents for the 
children and the Child; but there 
were no children there, and the mum- 
mers were turned away, baffled and 
resentful (for the rich American, 
who was said to be writing a book 
about the frescoes of Pompeii, had 
previously shown himself open- 
handed), but addly grateful too; it 
was a cold night, and the lights in 
the palazzo were of a grim and 
distant color. 

Then the gates closed. The prin- 
cipals had gathered and were in 
their places; and the stage was set.

The Trouble With Vegans 

by ROGER DEELEY 

Vegans? All the galaxy knows 
they're lovable rogues — very 
lovable , and indubitable rogues! 



'T'o start with, Vegans are al- specification which could cater to 

A together the wrong shape. We the Vegans’ almost liquid flowing 

had built the Autofrisk on lines that contours. 

would enable it to fit every one of Which might not have mattered, 
the numerous life-forms of the Gal- Except that they were compulsive 
axy. We thought. The trouble with smugglers. 

Vegans is that they’re constructed They did it when it wasn’t even 
back to front, inside out, upside particularly useful, let alone neces- 

down, take away the number you sary. It was something in their past 

first thought of, with everything history which accounted for this; 

possibly wrong that could possibly they had built their vast empire of 

be wrong. Imagine the most unlike- trade and commerce through good 

ly and improbable shape you can, old-fashioned crooked methods, and 

and that’s a Vegan. The first time the habit had now become long in- 

an Autofrisk was ever tried on one herent. At first most members of the 

had turned out to be acutely em- Galactic Federation had turned a 

barrassing to the commander of the blind eye. Vegans were friendly, 

Vegan merchant-cruiser, and as a charming, the most likeable of all 

result Terran-Vegan relations for the races of the Galaxy, you just 

some time were extremely strained couldn’t even remotely reprimand 

— not to mention a certain vitally them. But then some contraband 

important part of the commander’s goods slipped skillfully into the maj- 

anatomy. And although many had or spaceport of Wlaxtac bad result- 

sdnce tried to perfect one, there was ed in every single inhabitant of that 

no machine of any size, shape or system breaking out in a rash of 



25 




green spots. Luckily that was not 
serious, but the point was that it 
could have been. One of the big- 
gest single dangers in the galaxy was 
that some bacteria considered minor 
and unimportant in one system 
should possibly prove dangerous or 
even deadly in another. Hence the 
demand by the Praesidium for 
tighter customs regulations on every 
planet. Hence the Autofrisk here 
in Newyorkport. 

And then dammit the Vegans 
didn’t fit. They could hide any 
number of things in kangaroo-like 
pouches scattered haphazardly about 
their persons, and short of starting 
a diplomatic incident we could not 
trace them. They were quite willing, 
even eager, to be searched — that 
added to the fun of the game for 
them — but it was a waste of time 
and effort. And temper. Since the 
Sterilobacteria Room in every space- 
port got rid of the danger of infec- 
tion from goods actually carried on 
the person, this state of affairs was 
accepted with rueful equanimity by 
most customs officers. The loss of 
revenue from the goods on a Vegan’s 
person you might as well accept. 
A Vegan ship was another matter 
altogether. 

So here I was, on a bright May 
morning which was far too good 
for a situation like this, standing in 
the control room as the Vegan mer- 
chantman was talked down. 

Perhaps I should explain that I 
am the Chief Customs Officer of 
the Newyorkport Spacecenter. At 
least, I was. The reason I’m not to 
this day is entirely the fault of that 
particular merchantman, and of her 



captain, Llant’Gomu Gra-Oud, a 
man whose sheer animal cunning 
would hav& made Machiavelli 
creep off in shame to go check up 
on his textbooks. Customs officers 
throughout the galaxy manage to 
maintain a pretty good average rate 
of about eighty to eighty-five per 
cent success in preventing Vegan 
smuggling, so it needn’t necessarily 
have been too shameful for me if 
Commander Llant’Gomu had mere- 
ly outwitted me. What cost me my 
pride as well as my job was the 
way he did it. And the results. 

A s soon as the ship had docked 
and been radiation-checked I 
moved to make an immediate in- 
spection. I had no reason to sus- 
pect anything out of the usual, al- 
lowing for the fact that Vegans 
seldom do anything that isn’t out 
of the usual, but I was determined 
to make a good impression on Lt. 
Malo Allallu, a young Martian who 
had just passed out of college and 
was starting on a career in Customs 
and Excise. Perhaps if I had had 
someone more experienced with me 
the ghastly debacle that followed 
need not have happened, but I can 
hardly blame Allallu. If I myself 
didn’t fathom the incredible depths 
of Llant’Gomu’s criminally cunning 
mind, I can hardly complain at 
Allallu if he didn’t either. 

I entered the airlock. Since the 
Vegan atmosphere was the same 
as ours, all the doors of the ship 
were fully open, and the crew were 
standing idly around in small groups 
enjoying the taste of fresh air after 
so many months of the canned stuff 




spaceside. They grinned and waved 
as I came in, if a foot-long elonga- 
tion of one of their tongues and the 
elevation of four tentacles in a com- 
plicated ancestral pattern can be 
called a grin and a wave. That’s what 
it added up to, anyway. You can’t 
help liking Vegans, whatever then- 
faults, they’re such a cheerful bunch. 
Cheerful, happy, and courageous. 
And crooks, through and through. I 
strode on to the commander’s cabin, 
with Allallu close behind me. 

Iiant’Gomu rose as 1 came in 
and advanced towards me. “My 
friend,” he boomed with easy in- 
formality, “I and my fathers greet 
you and yours.” It was a conven- 
tional form of greeting on his home 
planet, the third in the Vegan sys- 
tem, as far as I knew. Luckily he 
spoke fluent Terran. Most Vegans 
did, since their own language was 
the most complicated in the Galaxy, 
full of clicks, gurgles and retching 
sounds that come over rather like 
a mixture of Tovringian Southern, 
Ancient Terran Zulu, and Li Husat. 
And though, despite their double 
tongue, then can pronounce Terran 
Universal, they’re all totally unable 
to master Galactica. 

“I and mine thank your fathers,” 
I replied. 

He laughed boisterously. “It al- 
ways sounds wrong somehow com- 
ing from Terrans,” he commented. 
“Can I offer you a drink? I have 
some exquisite vintage Vungtakha 
Blue in the hold.” 

“Not at the moment, thanks,” I 
said. “Er, have you anything to 
declare?” 

That must be one of the most 



stupid things I ever said. Llant’Gor- 
nu did the Vegan equivalent of a 
shrug and a crooked smile. “Who, 
me?” he said. 

Vegans will never lie outright. 
That’s part of the reason why they’re 
so astonishingly popular considering 
everything. They will never say a 
thing is so if it is not so. However, 
with the slightest hesitation they will 
talk around the point, change the 
subject, twist your words, or, if 
pushed right into a corner, take 
refuge in a bland silence. But they 
will never lie. 

‘Yes, Commander, you. Are you 
carrying any contraband?” 

“I rather think that depends on 
your definition of contraband.” 

“I define contraband as some- 
thing which should be declared be- 
fore entering a port.” 

“Why?” 

“Why? Because there might be 
revenue to pay on it.” 

“Why?” 

“My dear commander, you know 
as well as I do what contraband is. 
Must we go on beating about the 
bush like this? Are you carrying 
any?” 

“You’ll have to be more clear. 
Do you mean am I personally car- 
rying any, or is the ship carrying 
any, or what?” 

“Either of those possibilities.” I 
was growing a trifle harrassed. 
“Which one?” 

“Are youV 
“Am I what?” 

“Carrying any contraband?” 

He raised his arms, all of them. 
“I’m not actually carrying anything,” 
he informed me cheerfully. 



THE TROUBLE WITH VEGANS 



27 




I rose to my feet. This time I was 
going to nail them. I knew damn 
well I was a relatively good cus- 
toms officer, and I just couldn’t let 
the commander get away with it 
without a fight. 

“Lt. Allallu!” 

“Sir?” 

“I want every available customs 
officer on the base to assemble 
here immediately. I’m going to 
search this ship from stem to stem, 
then back again, then back again 
if need be, and we’re going to find 
whatever contraband they’re carry- 
ing, every last ounce of it.” 

“Every man?” said Allallu in 
some surprise. 

“Yes!” I bellowed. “Every single 
one that isn’t sick, dead or on leave 
must be here on the double. On 
the treble if they have to. I expect 
them here on this ship’s Flag Deck 
within fifteen minutes. Jump to it!” 

H e jumped. In actual fact he got 
them there in ten. He’s a good 
man, Allallu. One day he might 
even make a Chief Officer — pro- 
viding he doesn’t act like me, that 
is. 

As soon as the men were as- 
sembled — there were twenty-two 
of them, if I remember rightly — 
I told them what I had told Allallu. 
The whole ship was to be combed 
thoroughly, and any other ships that 
might land and want Customs clear- 
ance in the meantime would just 
damn well have to wait. Llanf’Gomu 
watched all this with evident amuse- 
ment. This had developed into a 
battle of wills as well as wits be- 
tween him and me, and we both 



knew it. And I was determined he 
was not going to win. 

And he wa£ determined he was. 

And he was a Vegan, remember. 

The first thing I did was order 
all the exits watched. I’d heard of 
a case on Betelgeuse where a rath- 
er green Customs officer had or- 
dered a minute search of a Vegan 
cruiser as I was doing now, but had 
forgotten in his enthusiasm to watch 
the doors. As a result, while his men 
were laboriously working their way 
through the ship, the Vegans were 
casually wandering right out of the 
main exits in broad daylight carry- 
ing bundles of contraband under 
their arms. This was not going to 
happen with me. 

I gave Allallu his orders, then 
remained on the flag deck as the 
search was carried out. They started 
on the bridge, all the men together, 
and combed it so thoroughly that a 
flea could not have escaped. No 
fleas. No contraband. The flight 
deck the same. And the crew quar- 
ters. And the engine room. And 
so on and so forth. Right down to 
the drive tubes. All clean as a 
whistle. It took them three hours 
to find this out. I was sweating. 

“You see?” remarked Llant’Gomu 
casually from a doorway. “They 
didn’t find anything.” 

“No,” I agreed. ‘They didn’t.” 
I felt like grinding my teeth until 
they came out in the form of a 
fine white powder. “Allallu, are 
you sure there’s nothing here?” 

“Certain, sir. These cruisers 
aren’t that large, and we’ve exam- 
ined every nut and bolt. Perhaps 
there is no contraband?” 



28 



IF 




“On a Vegan merchantman? You 
must be joking!” 

Commander Llant’Gomu looked 
solicitous. “You need a drink,” he 
said. “Here.” 

“Thanks.” I did need a drink. It 
was cool and delicious. 

And blue. I choked. 

“You found nothing?” I said to 
Allallu. 

“No, sir.” 

“Then what about this? A con- 
signment of Vungtakha Blue, which 
the commander was even foolish 
enough to mention personally. 
Where is that?” 

He looked blank. “I’m afraid I 
don’t 

“Where was the crew while your 
search was going on?” 

“Going about their duties, sir. At 
least, I assumed so.” 

“Never assume anything with 
Vegans. Rule One of the Customs 
official. I suppose they were car- 
rying various things?” 

“I didn’t see, but . 

I sighed. It was Betelgeuse all 
over again. Thank God I’d put men 
©n the doors. “Lieutenant,” I said, 
‘Vhile you’ve been searching, the 
crew have been merrily going around 
rearranging everything. You’ve been 
passing contraband every time you 
passed a member of the crew.” He 
looked suitably dumbfounded, as 
well he might. “We will now search 
again, even more thoroughly. And 
this time the crew — that includes 
you, Commander, if you would — 
will stay in their quarters. And III 
head the search.” 

So we did it again. This time it 
took us five and a half hours. It was 



now nearly nine hours since I had 
first come aboard. In that time two 
merchant cruisers had landed from 
Lunaport, both perfectly routine lo- 
cal flights, plus one stellar from Sir- 
ius. All of these would have been 
dealt with quickly and easily if I 
hadn’t commandeered every avail- 
able Customs officer in the port. Al- 
ready their captains were filing per- 
fectly justified complaints. All I had 
to show for all this was a few dozen 
crates of the Vungtakha Blue. To 
me this was downright suspicious. 
As the lieutenant had said, these 
ships weren’t all that large, I had 
searched everywhere and there was 
no more contraband aboard. But 
that wine was pretty small pick- 
ings for a Vegan ship. The few 
times that a search such as this was 
ordered on a Vegan ship normally 
turned up a veritable Aladdin’s cave 
of dutiable goodies. However, I was 
forced to admit defeat. 

Commander Llant’Gornu, as I had 
expected, was courtesy itself when 
I allowed him and his crew to dis- 
embark, having apologized for keep- 
ing them cooped up for so long. 
He paid the duty on the Vungtakha 
without a murmur, and offered me 
one of his own personal bottles as 
a gift. You just can’t help liking 
Vegans. 

I hurriedly inspected and passed 
the Sirian, allowing someone else 
to deal with the two lunar flights, 
and got back to the control room an 
hour or so later. The first thing I 
did was leaf through the messages 
which had come in while I was oc- 
cupied. They all seemed relatively 



THE TROUBLE WITH VEGANS 



29 




uninteresting — except one. As I 
read it the skin of my back slowly 
crawled up and started biting the 
hack of my neck: 

To: Chief Officer, Customs,

RA/Lok. From: Ditto. Bordash.

CEED. HIS REPLY: (QUOTE)

THIS SHIP MUST NOT REPEAT 
NOT BE ALLOWED TO LAND. 
ANYTHING WHICH COMES IN- 
TO CONTACT COULD CORREC- 
TION WOULD CORRECTION 
WILL DEFINITELY SPREAD THE 
INFECTION. 

“Why wasn’t I shown this?” I 
roared at the communications offi- 
cer. 

“You’d said you didn’t wish to 
be disturbed, sir,” he answered, sur- 
prised. “If any ship of that name 
had attempted a landing I would 
have informed you, naturally.” 

I suddenly felt rather ill. I sat 
down. This message had arrived just 
ten minutes after I had left the 
control room earlier, and even then 
my opposite number on Alpha Cen- 
tauri had left it just that little too 
late. • Probably too worried about his 
newly forming rash of green spots. 
Baccillus Wlaxtaccus spreads too 
fast for comfort. I looked at the 



bottle of wine handed me by Llant- 
’Gomu with a weary smile. Go mate 
with a Veflusian hedgehog. 

“Is there anything wrong, sir?” 
asked the communications officer. 

“Oh no,” I said. “Nothing at all. 
Does anyone here know any Vegan 
at all, by any chance?” 

They all shook their heads. “I 
thought no one could speak Ve- 
gan?” said Allallu. 

“No one can carry on a conversa- 
tion,” I replied. “But some people 
do know a little, names of ships for 
instance. Tell me, Lieutenant, will 
you read to me the name of Com- 
mander Llant’Gornu’s ship. You can 
make it out from here. It’s written in 
Galactical characters as well as Ve- 
gan.” 

Still puzzled, Allallu picked up the 
binoculars and stared across the 
spaceport. “Takka’Aq Dorg,” he 
said after a moment. 

“Right. Now, Lt. Allallu, am I 
or am I not the Chief Customs Offi- 
cer here at Newyorkport?” 

He frowned. “You are, sir.” 
“And did I or did I not, on my 
authority alone, order every single 
man here to search that Vegan ship, 
Takka’Aq Dorg , with me?” 

“You did, sir.” 

“And were there or were there 
not three ships out there fuming 
because no one dealt with them 
for hours?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“And what contraband did we 
find to show for this, for having 
held up a whole spaceport for nine 
hours?” 

“A dozen crates of wine, sir.” 

“A dozen crates of wine. Lieuten- 

IF 



30 




ant, do you know what the transla- 
tion of TakkafAq Dorg is?” 

“No, sir.” 

“It’s Vegan for Star of Hope . That 
is the merchantman in the signal. 
They didn’t put the Vegan name 
when they sent the message at Cen- 
tauri, my communications man 
doesn’t know Vegan, he can’t be 
expected to, and I had said no mes- 
sages unless vital,” Allallu was be- 
ginning to realize the truth. “That 
ship, Lieutenant, not just the crew, 
or the contraband, or the legal car- 
go, but the whole ship, is infected 
with little green spots! No wonder 
we couldn’t find any contraband.” 
I was nearly shouting now. “The 



whole damn thing is contraband! 
Llant’Gomu smuggled in a space- 
ship!” 

W hich was why the whole pop- 
ulation of Terra, with the ex- 
ception of one civil servant in Bue- 
nos Aires who appeared immune, 
went down with a rash of green 
spots. Which was why I lost my 
job. Which is why I’m now Chief 
Officer on the Vegan merchantman 
Takka f Aq Dorg, or Star of Hope if 
you wish, under the command of 
Commodore Llant’Gomu Gra-Oud. 
Well, I mean, somehow you just 
can’t harbor grudges against Vegans.
