Existence depended on the 
Pattern. And the Pattern 
was being broken 



Amber: high and bright atop Kol- 
vir in the middle of the day. A 
black road: low and sinister through 
Gamath from Chaos to the south. 
Me: cursing, pacing and occasion- 



^ ally reading in the library of the 
S palace in Amber. The door to that 



library: closed and barred. 

The mad prince of Amber seated 
himself at the desk, returned his at- 
tention to the opened volume. There 
was a knock on the door. 

“Go away!” I said. 

“Corwin. It’s me — Random. 

Open up, huh? I even brought 
lunch.” 

“Just a minute.” 

I got to my feet again, rounded 
the desk, crossed the room. Ran- 
dom nodded when I opened the 
door. He carried a tray which he 
took to a small table near the desk. 
“Plenty of food there,” I said. 
“I’m hungry, too.” 

“So do something about it.” 

He did. He carved. He passed me 
some meat on a slab of -bread. He 
poured wine. We seated ourselves 



and ate. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



A-:,. ... 



“I know you are still mad . .” 
he said after a time. 

“Aren’t you?” 

“Well, maybe I am more used to 
it. I don’t know. Still .... Yes. It 
was sort of abrupt, wasn’t it?” 
“Abrupt?” I took a large swal- 
low of wine. “It is just like the old 
days. Worse even. I had actually 
come to like him when he was play- 
ing at being Ganelon. Now that he 
is back in control, he is just as 
preemptory as ever. He has given us 
a set of orders he has not bothered 
to explain and he has disappeared 
again.” 

“He said he would be in touch 
soon.” 

“I imagine he intended that last 
time, too.” 

“I’m not so sure.” 

“And he explained nothing about 
his other absence. In fact, he has 
not really explained anything.” 

“He must have his reasons.” 

“I am beginning to wonder. 
Random. Do you think his mind 
might finally be going?” 

“He was still sharp enough to 
fool you.” 

“That was a combination of low 
animal cunning and shapeshifting 
ability.” 

“It worked, didn’t it?” 

“Yes. It worked.” 

“Corwin, could it be that you do 
not want him to have a plan that 
might be effective, that you do not 
want him to be right?” 

“That is ridiculous. I want this 
mess cleared up as much as any of 



5 



US.” 

“Yes, but wouldn’t you rather 
the answer came from another quar- 
ter?” 

“What are you getting at?” 

“You do not want to trust him.” 

“I will admit that. I have not 
seen him — as himself — in a hell of 
a long time, and — ” 

He shook his head. 

“That is not what I mean. You 
are angry that he is back, aren’t 
you? You hoped that we had seen 
the last of him.” 

I looked away. 

“There is that,” I finally said. 
“But not for a vacant throne, ot not 
just for it. It is him. Random. Him. 
lliat’s all.” 

“I know,” he said. “But you 
have to admit he suckered Brand, 
which is not an easy thing to do. 
He pulled a stunt I still do not un- 
derstand, getting you to bring that 
sum back from Tir-na Nog’th, 
somehow getting me to pass it 
along to Benedict, seeing to it that 
Benedict was in the right place at 
the proper moment so that every- 
thing worked and he got the Jewel 
back. He is also still better than we 
are at Shadow play. He managed it 
right on Kolvir when he took us to 
the primal Pattern. I cannot do that. 
Neither can you. And he was able 
to whip Gerard. I do not believe 
that he is slowing down. I think he 
knows exactly what he is doing, 
and whether we like it or not, I 
think he is the only one who can 
deal with the present situation.”

“You are trying to say that I 
should trust him?” 

“I am trying to say that you have 
no choice.” 

I sighed. 

“I guess you’ve put your finger 
on it,” I said. “No sense in my 
being bitter. Still . .” 

“The attack order bothers you, 
doesn’t it?” 

“Yes, among other things. If we 
would wait longer, Benedict could 
field a greater force. Three days is 
not much time to get ready for 
something like this. Not when we 
are so uncertain about the enemy.” 
“But we may not be. He spoke 
in private with Benedict for a long 
while.” 

“And that is the other thing. 
These separate orders. This secre- 
cy .... He is not trusting us any 
more than he has to.” 

Random chuckled. So did I. 

“All right,” I said. “Maybe I 
would not either. But three days to 
launch a war.” I shook my head. 
“He had better know something we 
don’t.” 

“I get the impression that it is 
more a pre-emptory strike than a 
war.” 

“Only he did not bother to tell us 
what we are pre-empting.” 

Random shrugged, poured more 
wine. 

“Perhaps he will say when he 
gets back. You did not get any spe- 
cial orders, did you?” 

“Just to stand and wait. What 
about you?” 

GALAXY 



He shook his head. 

“He said that when the time 
comes, I will know. At least with 
Julian, he told him to have his 
troops ready to move on a mo- 
ment’s notice.” 

“Oh? Aren’t they staying in Ar- 
den?” 

He nodded. 

“When did he say this?” 

“After you left. He trumped Ju- 
lian up here to give him the mes- 
sage, and they rode off together. I 
heard Dad say that he would ride 
partway back with him.” 

“Did they take the eastern trail 
over Kolvir?’ ’ 

“Yes. I saw them off.” 
“Interesting. What else did I 
miss?” 

He shifted in his seat. 

“The part that bothers me,” he 
said. “After Dad had mounted and 
waved a good-bye, he looked back 
at me and said, ‘And keep an eye 
on Martin.’ ” 

“That is all?” 

“That is all. But he was laughing 
as he said it.” 

“Just natural suspicion of a new- 
comer, I guess.” 

“Then why the laugh?” 

“I give up.” 

I cut a piece of cheese and ate it. 
“Might not be a bad idea, 
though. It might not be suspicion. 
Maybe he feels Martin needs to be 
protected from something. Or both. 
Or neither. You know how he 
sometimes is.” 

Random stood. 

THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



“I had not thought through to the 
alternative. Come with me now, 
huh?” he said. “You have been up 
here all morning.” 

“All right.” I got to my feet, 
buckled on Grayswandir. “Where is 
Martin, anyway?” 

“I left him down on the first 
floor. He was talking with Gerard.” 
“He is in good hands, then. Is 
Gerard going to be staying here, or 
will he be returning to the fleet?” 

“I do not know. He would not 
discuss his orders.” 

We left the room. We headed for 
the stairway. 

On the way down, I heard some 
small commotion from below and I 
quickened my pace. 

I looked over the railing and saw 
a throng of guards at the entrance to 
the throne room, along with the 
massive figure of Gerard. All of 
them had their backs to us. I leaped 
down the final stairs. Random was 
not far behind me. 

I pushed my way through. 
“Gerard, what is happening?” I 
asked. 

“Damned if I know,” he said. 
“Look for yourself. But there is no 
getting in.” 

He moved aside and I took a step 
forward. Then another. And that 
was it. It was as if I were pushing 
against a slightly resilient, totally 
invisible wall. Beyond was a slight 
that tied my memory and feelings 
into a knot. I stiffened as fear took 
hold of me by the neck, clasped my 
hands. No mean trick, that. 

7 



Martin, smiling, still held a 
Trump in his left hand, and 
Benedict — apparently recently sum- 
moned — stood before him. A girl 
was nearby, on the dais beside 
the throne, facing away. Both men 
appeared to be speaking, but I could 
not hear the words. 

Finally, Benedict turned and 
seemed to address the girl. After a 
time, she appeared to be answering 
him. Martin moved off to her left. 
Benedict mounted the <dais as she 
spoke. I could see her face then. 
The exchange continued. 

“That girl looks somewhat famil- 
iar,” said Gerard, who had moved 
forward and now stood at my side. 

“You might have gotten a 
glimpse of her as she rode past us,” 
I told him, “the day Eric died. It’s 
Dara.” 

I heard his sudden intake of 
breath. 

“Dara!” he said. “Then you 
. .” His voice faded. 

“1 was not lying,” I said. “She 
is real.” 

“Martin!” cried Random, who 
had moved up on my right. “Mar- 
tin! What’s going on!” 

There was no response. 

“I don’t think he can hear you,” 
Gerard said. “This barrier seems to 
have cut us off completely.” 

Random strained forward, his 
hands pushing against something 
unseen. 

“Let’s all of us give it a shove,” 
he said. 

So I tried again. Gerard also 



threw his weight against the invisi- 
ble wall. 

After half a minute without suc- 
cess, I eased back. 

“No good,” 1 said. “We can’t 
move it.” 

“What is the damned thing?” 
Random asked. -“What is holding — ” 

I’d had a hunch — only that, 
though — as to what might be going 
on. 

And only because of the deja vu 
character of the entire piece. Now, 
though .... Now I clasped my hand 
to my scabbard to assure myself 
that Grayswandir still hung at my 
side. 

It did. 

Then how could I explain the 
presence of my distinctive blade, its 
elaborate tracery gleaming for all to 
see, hanging where it had suddenly 
appeared, without support, in the air 
before the throne, its point barely 
touching Dara’s throat? 

1 could not. 

But it was too similar to what 
had happened that night in the 
dream city in the sky. Tir-na 
Nog’th, to be a coincidence. Here 
were none of the trappings — the 
darkness, the confusion, the heavy 
shadows, the tumultuous emotions I 
had known — and yet the piece was 
set much as it had been that night. 
It was very similar. But not pre- 
cisely so. Benedict’s stance seemed 
somewhat off — farther back, his 
body angled differently. While 1 
could not read her lips, I wondered 
whether Dara was asking the same 



8 



GALAXY 



strange questions. I doubted it. The 
tableau — like, yet unlike, that which 
I had experienced — had probably 
been colored at the other end — ^that 
is, if there were any connection at 
all — by the effects of Tir-na 
Nog’th’s powers on my mind at that 
time. 

“Corwin,” Random said, “that 
looks like Grayswandir hanging in 
front of her.” 

“It does, doesn’t it?” I replied. 
“But as you can see, I am wearing 
my blade.” 

“There can’t be another just like 
it . can there? Do you know 
what is happening?” 

“I am beginning to feel as if I 
may,” I said. “Whatever, I am 
powerless to stop it. ” 

Benedict’s blade suddenly came 
free and engaged the other, so like 
my own. In a moment, he was 
fighting an invisible opponent. 

“Give him hell, Benedict!” Ran- 
dom shouted. 

“It is no use,” I said. “He is 
about to be disarmed.” 

“How can you know?” Gerard 
asked. 

“Somehow, that is me in there 
fighting with him,” I said. “This is 
the other end of my dream in Tir-na 
Nog’th. I do not know how he 
managed it, but this is the price for 
Dad’s recovering the Jewel.” 

“1 do not follow you,” he said. 

I shook my head. 

“I do not pretend to understand 
how it is being done,” I told him. 
“But we will not be able to enter 



until two things have vanished from 
that room.” 

“What two things?” 

“Just watch.” 

Benedict’s blade had changed 
hands, and his gleaming prosthesis 
shot forward and fixed itself upon 
some unseen target. The two blades 
parried one another, locked, 
pressed, their points moving toward 
the ceiling. Benedict’s right hand 
continued to tighten. 

Suddenly, the Grayswandir-blade 
was free and moving past the 
other. It struck a terrific blow to 
Benedict’s right arm at the place 
where the metal portion joined it. 
Benedict turned — and the action 
was blocked to our view for several 
moments. 

Then the sight was clear again as 
Benedict dropped to one knee, turn- 
ing. He clutched at the stump of his 
arm. The mechanical hand/arm 
hung in the air near Grayswandir. It 
was moving away from Benedict 
and descending, as was the blade. 
When both reached the floor, they 
did not strike it but passed on 
through, vanishing from sight. 

I lurched forward, recovered my 
balance, moved ahead. The barrier 
was gone. 

Martin and Dara reached Ben- 
edict before we did. Dara had al- 
ready tom a strip from her cloak 
and was binding Benedict’s stump 
when Gerard, Random and I got 
there. 

Random seized Martin by the 
shoulder and turned him. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

“What happened?” he asked. 
“Dara — Dara told me she wanted 
to see Amber,” he said. “Since I 
live here now, I agreed to bring her 
through and show her around. 
Then—” 

“Bring her through? You mean 
on a Trump?” 

“Well, yes.” 

“Yours or hers?” 

Martin raked his lower lip with 
his teeth. 

“Well, you see . .” 

“Give me those cards,” said 
Random, and he snatched the case 
from Martin’s belt. He opened it 
and began going through them. 

“Then I thought to tell Benedict 
since he was interested in her,” 
Martin went on. “Then Benedict 
wanted to come and see — ” 

“What the hell!” Random said. 
“There is one of you, one of her, 
and one of a guy I’ve never even 
seen before! Where did you get 
these?” 

“Let me see them,” 1 said. 

He passed me the three cards. 
“Well?” he said. “Was it 
Brand? He is the only one I know 
who can make Trumps now.” 

“I would not have anything to do 
with Brand,” Martin replied, “ex- 
cept to kill him.” 

But I already knew they were not 
from Brand. They were simply not 
in his style. Nor were they in the 
style of anyone whose work I knew. 
Style was not foremost in my mind 
at that moment, however. Rather, it 
was the features of the third person. 



the one whom Random had said he 
had never seen before. I had. I was 
looking at the face of the youth who 
had confronted me with a crossbow 
before the Courts of Chaos, recog- 
nized me and then declined to 
shoot. 

I extended the card. 

“Martin, who is this?” I asked. 

“The man who made these extra 
Trumps,” he said. “He drew one 
of himself while he was about it. I 
do not know his name. He is a 
friend of Dara’s.” 

“You are lying,” Random said. 

“Then let Dara tell us,” I said, 
and I turned to her. 

She still knelt beside Benedict, 
though she had finished bandaging 
him and he was now sitting up. 

“How about it?” I said, waving 
the card at her. “Who is this 
man?” 

She glanced at the card, then up 
at me. She smiled. 

“You really do not know?” she 
asked. 

“Would I be asking if I did?” 

“Then look at it again and go 
look in a mirror. He is your son as 
much as mine. His name is Mer- 
lin.” 

I am not easily shocked, but this 
had nothing of ease about it. I felt 
dizzy. But my mind moved quickly. 
With the proper time differential, the 
thing was possible. 

“Dara,” I said, “what is it that 
you want?” 

“I told you when I walked the 
Pattern,” she said, “that Amber 



10 



GALAXY 



must be destroyed. What I want is 
to have my rightful part in it.” 

“You will have my old cell,” I 
said. “No, the one next to it. 
Guards!” 

“Corwin, it is all right,” Ben- 
edict said, getting to his feet. “It 
is not as bad as it sounds. She can 
explain everything.” 

“Then let her start now.” 

“No. In private. Just family.” 

I motioned back the guards who 
had come at my call. 

“Very well. Let us adjourn to 
one of the rooms up the hall.” 

He nodded, and Dara took hold 
of his left arm. Random, Gerard, 
Martin and I followed them out. I 
looked back once to the empty 
place where my dream had come 
true. Such is die stuff. 



II. 

I RODE UP over the crest of Kolvir 
and dismounted when I came to my 
tomb. 1 went inside and opened the 
casket. It was empty. Good. I was 
beginning to wonder. I had half- 
expected to see myself laid out be- 
fore me, evidence that despite signs 
and intuitions, I had somehow wan- 
dered into the wrong shadow. 

I went back outside and rubbed 
Star’s nose. The sun was shining 
and the breeze was chill. I had a 
sudden desire to go to sea. I seated 
myself on the bench instead and 
fumbled with my pipe. 

We had talked. Seated with her 



legs beneath her on the brown sofa, 
Dara had smiled and repeated the 
story of her descent from Benedict 
and Lintra, the hellmaid, growing 
up in and about the Courts of 
Chaos, a grossly non-Euclidean 
realm where time itself presented 
strange distribution problems. 

“The things you told me when 
we met were lies,” I said. “Why 
should I believe you now?” 

She had smiled and regarded her 
fingernails. 

“I had to lie to you then, to get 
what I wanted from you.” 

“That being. ?” 

“Knowledge, of the family, the 
Pattern, the Trumps, of Amber. To 
gain your trust. To have your 
child.” 

“The truth would not have served 
as well?” 

“Hardly. I come ftom the 
enemy. My reasons for wanting these 
things were not the sort of which 
you would approve.” 

“Your swordplay. ? You told 
me then that Benedict had trained 
you.” 

She smiled again and her eyes 
showed dark fires. 

“I learned from the great Duke 
Borel himself, a High Lord of 
Chaos.” 

”... and your appearance,” I 
said. “It was altered on a number 
of occasions when I saw you walk 
the Pattern. How? Also, why?” 

“All whose origins involve 
Chaos are shapeshifters,” she re- 
plied. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



11 



I thought of Dworkin’s perform- 
ance the night he had imperson- 
ated me. 

Benedict nodded. 

“Dad fooled us with his Ganelon 
disguise.” 

“Oberon is a son of Chaos,” 
Dara said, “a rebel son of a rebel 
father. But the power is still there.” 

“Then why is it we cannot do 
it?” Random asked. 

She shrugged. 

“Have you ever tried? Perhaps 
you can. On the other hand, it may 
have died out with your generation. 
I do not know. As to myself, how- 
ever, I have certain favored shapes 
to which I revert in times of stress. 

I grew up where this was the rule, 
where the other shape was actually 
sometimes dominant. It is still a re- 
flex with me. This is what you 
witnessed — that day.” 

“Dara,” I said, “why did you 
want the things that you said you 
wanted — knowledge of the family, 
the Pattern, the Trumps, Amber? 
And a son?” 

“All right” She sighed. “All 
right. You are by now aware of 
Brand’s plans — ^the destruction and 
rebuilding of Amber. ?” 

“Yes.” 

“This involved our consent and 
cooperation.” 

“Including the murder of Mar- 
tin?” Random asked. 

“No,” she said. “We did not 
know who he intended to use as 
the — agent.” 

“Would it have stopped you had 

12 



you known?” 

“You are asking a hypothetical 
question,” she said. “Answer it 
yourself. 1 am glad that Martin is 
still alive. That is all that I can say 
about it.” 

“All right,” Random said. 
“What about Brand?” 

“He was able to contact our 
leaders by methods he had learned 
from Dworkin. He Tiad ambitions. 
He needed knowledge, power. He 
offered a deal.” 

“What sort of knowledge?” 

“For one thing, he did not know 
how to destroy the Pattern — ” 

“Then you were responsible for 
what he did,” Random said. 

“If you choose to look at it that 
way.” 

“I do.” 

She shrugged, looked at me. 

“Do you want to hear this 
story?” 

“Go ahead.” I glanced at Ran- 
dom and he nodded. 

“Brand was given what he 
wanted,” she said, “but he was not 
trusted. It was feared that once he 
possessed the power to shape the 
world as he would, he would not 
stop with ruling over a revised 
Amber. He would attempt to extend 
his dominion over Chaos as well. A 
weakened Amber was what was de- 
sired so that Chaos would be 
stronger than it now is — the striking 
of a new balance, giving to us more 
of the Shadowlands that lie between 
our realms. It was realized long ago 
that the two kingdoms can never be 

GALAXY 



merged, or one destroyed, without 
also disrupting all the processes that 
lie in flux between us. Total stasis 
or complete chaos would be the re- 
sult. Yet, though it was seen what 
Brand had in mind, our leaders 
came to terms with him. It was the 
best opportunity to present itself in 
ages. It had to be seized. It was felt 
that Brand could be dealt with, and 
finally replaced, when the time 
came.” 

“So you were also planning a 
double-cross,” Random said. 

“Not if he kept his word. But 
then, we knew that he would not. 
So we provided for the move 
against him.” 

“How?” 

“He would be allowed to accom- 
plish his end and then be destroyed. 
He would be succeeded by a 
member of the royal family of 
Amber who was also of the first 
family of the Courts, one who had 
been raised among us and trained 
for the position. Merlin even traces 
his connection with Amber on both 
sides, through my forebear Benedict 
and directly fi-om yourself — the two 
most favored claimants to your 
throne.” 

“You are of the royal house of 
Chaos?” 

She smiled. 

I rose. Strode away. Stared at the 
ashes on the grate. 

“I find it somewhat distressing to 
have been involved in a calculated 
breeding project,” I said, at length. 
“But be that as it may, and accept- 



ing everything you have said as 
true — for the moment — why are you 
telling us all of these things now?’ ’ 

“Because,” she said, “I fear that 
the lords of my realm would go as 
far for their vision as Brand would 
for his. Farther, perhaps. That bal- 
ance I spoke of. Few seem to ap- 
preciate what a delicate thing it is. I 
have traveled in the Shadowlands 
near, to Amber, and I have walked 
in Amber herself. I also have 
known the shadows that lie by 
Chaos’ side. 1 have met many 
people and seen many things. Then, 
when I encountered Martin and 
spoke with him, I began to feel that 
the changes I had been told would 
be for the better would not simply 
result in a revision of Amber more 
along the lines of my elders’ liking. 

“They would, instead, turn 
Amber into a mere extension of the 
Courts, most of the shadows would 
boil away to Join with Chaos. 
Amber would become an island. 
Some of my seniors who still smart 
at Dworkin’s having created Amber 
in the first place are really seeking a 
return to the days before this 
happened. 

“Total Chaos, from which all 
things arose. I see the present 
condition as superior and I wish to 
preserve it. My desire is that neither 
side emerge victorious in any con- 
flict.” 

I turned in time to see Benedict 
shaking his head. 

“Then you are on neither side,” 
he stated. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

“I like to think that I am on 
both.” 

“Martin,” I said, “are you in 
this with her?” 

He nodded. 

Random laughed. 

“The two of you? Against both 
Amber and the Courts of Chaos? 
What do you hope to achieve? How 
do you plan to further this notion of 
balance?” 

“We are not alone,” she said, 
“and the plan is not ours.” 

Her fingers dipped into her pock- 
et. Something glittered when she 
withdrew them. She turned it in the 
light. It was our father’s signet ring 
that she held. 

“Where did you get that?” Ran- 
dom asked. 

“Where else?” 

Benedict stepped toward her and 
held out his hand. She gave it to 
him. He scrutinized it. 

“It is his,” he said. “It has the 
little markings on the back that I’ve 
seen before. Why do you have it?” 

“First, to convince you that I am 
acting properly when I convey his 
orders,” she said. 

“How is it that you even know 
him?” I asked. 

“I met him during his — 
difficulties — some time back,” she 
told us. “In fact, you might say 
that I helped to deliver him from 

them. This was after I had met Mar- 
tin and I was inclined to be more 
sympathetic toward Amber. But 

then, your father is also a charming 
and persuasive man. I decided that I 

14 



could not simply stand by and see 
him remain prisoner to my kin.” 

“Do you know how he was cap- 
tured in the first place?” 

She shook her head. 

“I only know that Brand effected 
his presence in a shadow far enough 
from Amber that he would be taken 
there. I believe it involved a fake 
quest for a nonexistent magical tool 
which might heal the Pattern. He 
realizes now that only the Jewel can 
do it.” 

“Your helping him to get 
away .... How did this affect your 
relations with your own people?” 
“Not too damned well,” she 
said. “I am temporarily without a 
home.” 

“And you want one here?” 

She smiled again. 

“It depends on how things turn 
out. If my people have their way, I 
would as soon go back — or stay 
with what shadows remain.” 

I withdrew a Trump, glanced at 
it. 

“What of Merlin? Where is he 
now?” 

“They have him,” she said. “I 
fear he may be their man now. He 
knows his parentage, but they have 
had charge of his education for a 
long while. I do not know whether 
he could be gotten away.” 

I raised the Trump, stared at it. 
“No good,” she said. “It will 
not function between here and 
there.” 

I recalled how difficult Trump 
communication had been when I 



GALAXY 



■yv-*? 







had been to the fringes of that 
place. I tried anyway. 

The card grew cold in my hand 
and I reached out. There was the 
faintest flicker of a responding pres- 
ence. I tried harder. 

“Merlin, this is Corwin,” I said. 
“Do you hear me?” 

I seemed to hear a reply. It 
seemed to be, “I cannot — ” And 
then there was nothing. The card 
lost its coldness. 

“Did you reach him?” she 
asked. 

“I am not sure,” I said. “But I 
think so. Just for a moment.” 
“Better than I thought,” she 
said. “Either conditions are good or 
your minds are very similar.” 
“When you began waving Dad’s 
signet around, you spoke of orders,” 
Random said. “What orders? And 
why is he sending them through 
you?” 

“It is a matter of timing.” 
“Timing? Hell! He just left here 
this morning!” 

“He had to finish one thing be- 
fore he was ready for another. He 
had no idea how long it would take. 
But I was just in touch with him be- 
fore I came here — though I was 
hardly prepared for the reception I 
walked into — and he is now ready 
to begin the next phase.” 

“Where did you speak with 
him?” I asked. “Where is he?” 

“I have no idea where he is. He 
contacted me.” 

“And. ?” 

“He wants Benedict to attack 



immediately.” 

Gerard finally stirred from the 
huge armchair in which he had sat 
listening. He rose to his feet, 
hooked his thumbs in his belt and 
looked down at her. 

“An order like that would have 
to come directly from Dad.” 

“It did,” she said. 

He shook his head. 

“It makes no sense. Why contact 
you — someone we have small rea- 
son to trust — rather than one of 
us?” 

“I do not believe that he can 
reach you at the moment. On the 
other hand, he was able to reach 
me.” 

“Why?” 

“He did not use a Trump. He 
does not have one for me. He used 
a reverberation effect of the black 
road, similar to the means by which 
Brand once escaped Corwin.” 

“You know a lot of what has 
been going on.” 

“I do. I still have sources in the 
Courts, and Brand transported him- 
self there after your struggle. I hear 
things.” 

“Do you know where our father 
is right now?” Random asked. 

“No, I do not know. But I be- 
lieve that he has journeyed to the 
real Amber, to take counsel with 
Dworkin and to re-examine the dam- 
age to the primal Pattern.” 

“To what end?” 

“I do not know. Probably to de- 
cide on the course of action he will 
take. The fact that he reached me 



16 



GALAXY 



and ordered the attack most likely 
means that he has decided.” 

“How long ago was this com- 
munication?” 

“Just a few hours — my time. But 
I was far from here in Shadow. I do 
not know what the time differential 
is. I am too new at this.” 

“So it could be something ex- 
tremely recent. Possibly only mo- 
ments ago,” Gerard mused. “Why 
, did he talk with you rather than one 
of us? I do not believe that he could 
not reach us if he wished to.” 

“Perhaps to show that he looks 
upon me with favor,” she said. 

“All of this may be entirely 
true,” Benedict stated. “But I am 
not moving without a confirmation 
of that order.” 

“Is Fiona still at the primal Pat- 
tern?” Random asked. 

“Last I heard,” I told him, “she 
had set up camp there. I see what 
you mean . .” 

I shuffled out Fi’s card. 

“It took more than one of us to 
get through from there,” he ob- 
served. 

“True. So give me a hand.” 

He rose, came to my side. Ben- 
I edict and Gerard approached. 

“This is not really necessary,” 

I Dara protested. 

I ignored her and concentrated on 
I the delicate features of my red- 
' haired sister. Moments later we 
I had contact. 

“Fiona,” I asked, seeing from 
the background that she was still in 
residence at the heart of things, “is 

THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



Dad there?” 

“Yes,” she said, smiling tightly. 
“He is inside with Dworkin.” 
“Listen, urgency prevails. I do 
not know whether or not you know 
Dara, but she is here — ” 

“I know who she is, but I have 
never met her.” 

“Well, she claims she has an at- 
tack order for Benedict, from Dad. 
She has his signet to back it up, but 
he did not speak of this earlier. Do 
you know anything about it?” 
“No,” she said. “All we did 
was exchange greetings when he 
and Dworkin were out here earlier 
to look at the Pattern. I had some 
suspicions then, though, and this 
confirms them.” 

“Suspicions? What do you 
mean?’ ’ 

“I think Dad is going to try to 
repair the Pattern. He has the Jewel 
with him, and I overheard some of 
the things he said to Dworkin. If he 
makes the attempt, they will be 
aware of it in the Courts of Chaos 
the moment that he begins. They 
will try to stop him. He would want 
to strike first to keep them oc- 
cupied. Only . .” 

“What?” 

“It is going to kill him, Corwin. 
I know that much about it. Whether 
he succeeds or fails, he will be de- 
stroyed in the process.” 

“I find it hard to believe.” 

“That a king would give up his 
life for the realm?’ ’ 

“That Dad would.” 

“Then either he has changed or 

17 



you never really knew him. But I 
do believe he is going to try it.” 

“Then why send his latest order 
by someone he knows we do not 
really trust?” 

“To show that he wants you to 
trust her, I would guess, once he 
has confirmed it.” 

“It seems a roundabout way of 
doing things, but I agree that we 
should not act without that confir- 
mation. Can you get it for us?” 

“I will try. I will get back to you 
as soon as I have spoken with 
him.” 

She broke the contact. 

I turned toward Dara, who had 
heard only our side of the conversa- 
tion. 

“Do you know what Dad is 
going to do right now?” I asked 
her. 

“Something involving the black 
road,” she said. “He had indicated 
that much. What, though, or how, 
he did not say.” 

I turned away. I squared my 
cards and encased them. I did not 
like this turning of events. This en- 
tire day had started badly, and 
things had been going downhill ever 
since. It was only a little past lunch- 
time, too. I shook my head. 
When I had spoken with him, 
Dworkin had described the results 
of any attempt to repair the Pattern, 
and they had sounded pretty hor- 
rendous to me. Supposing Dad tried 
it, failed, and got himself killed in 
the attempt? Where would we be 
then? 

18 



Right where we were now, only 
without a leader, on the eve of 
battle — and with the succession 
problem stirring again. That whole 
ghastly business would be in the 
back of our minds as we rode to the 
wars, and we would all begin our 
private arrangements to fight one 
another once more as soon as the 
current enemy was dealt with. 
There had to be another way of 
handling things. Better Dad alive 
and on the throne than a revival of 
the succession intrigues. 

“What are we waiting for?” 
Dara asked. “Confirmation?” 

“Yes,” I replied. 

Random began to pace. Benedict 
seated himself and tested the dress- 
ing on his arm. Gerard leaned 
against the mantlepiece. I stood and 
thought. An idea came to me just 
then. I pushed it away immediately, 
but it returned. I did not like it, but 
that had nothing to do with prac- 
ticalities. I would have to move 
quickly, though, before I had a 
chance to talk myself around to 
another viewpoint. No. I would 
stick with this one. Damn it! 

There came a stirring of contact. 
I waited. Moments later I regarded 
Fiona again. She stood in a familiar 
place that it took me several sec- 
onds to recognize: Dworkin’s sitting 
room, on the other side of the 
heavy door at the back of the cave. 
Dad and Dworkin were both with 
her. Dad had dropped his Ganelon 
disguise and was his old self once 
again. I saw that he wore the Jewel. 

GALAXY 



“Corwin,” Fiona said, “it is 
true. Dad did send the attack order 
with Dara, and he expected this call 
for confirmation. I — ” 

“Fiona, bring me through.” 
“What?” 

“You heard me. Now!” 

I extended my right hand. She 
reached forward and we touched. 

“Corwin!” Random shouted. 
“What’s happening?” 

Benedict was on his feet, Gerard 
already moving toward me. 

“You will hear about it shortly,” 
I said, and I stepped forward. 

I squeezed her hand before I re- 
leased it and I smiled. 

“Thanks, Fi. Hello, Dad. Hi, 
Dworkin. How’s everything?” 

I glanced once at the heavy door, 
saw that it stood open. Then I 
passed around Fiona and moved to- 
ward them. Dad’s head was low- 
ered, his eyes narrowed. I knew 
that look. 

“What is this, Corwin? You are 
here without leave,” he said. “I 
have confirmed that damned order, 
now I expect it to be carried out.” 
“It will be,” I said, nodding. “I 
did not come here to argue about 
that.” 

“What, then?” 

I moved nearer, calculating my 
words as well as the distance. I was 
glad that he had remained seated. 

“For a time we rode as com- 
rades,” I said. “Damned if I did 
not come to like you then. I never 
had before, you know. Never had 
guts enough to say that before 

THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



either, but you know it is true. I 
like to think that that is how things • 
could have been, if we had not been 
what we are to each other.” For the 
barest moment, his gaze seemed to 
soften as I positioned myself. Then, 
“At any rate,” I went on, “I am 
going to believe in you that way 
rather than this way because there 
is something I would never have 
done for you otherwise.” 

“What?” he asked. 

“This.” 

I seized the Jewel with an upward 
sweeping motion and snapped the 
chain up over his head. I pivoted on 
my heel then and raced across the 
room and through the door. I drew 
it shut behind me and snapped it to. 

I could see no way to bar it from 
the outside, so I ran on, retracing 
the route through the cave from the 
night I had followed Dworkin along 
it. Behind me I heard the expected 
bellow. 

I followed the twistings. I stum- 
bled only once. Wixer’s smell still 
hung heavy in his lair. I pounded 
on and a final turning brought me a 
view of daylight ahead. 

I raced toward it, slipping the 
Jewel’s chain over my head as I 
went. I felt it fall to my breast. I 
reached down into it with my mind. 
There were echoes in the cave be- 
hind ihe. 

Outside! 

I sprinted toward the Pattern, 
feeling through the Jewel, turning it 
into an extra sense. I was the only 
person other than Dad or Dworkin 

19 



fully attuned to it. Dworkin had told 
me that the Pattern’s repair might 
be effected by a person’s walking 
the Grand Pattern in such a state of 
attunement, burning out the smear 
at each crossing, replacing it with 
stock from the image of the Pattern 
that he bore within him, wiping out 
the black road in the process. Better 
me than Dad, then. I still felt that 
the black road owed something of 
its final form to the strength my 
curse against Amber had given it. I 
wanted to wipe that out, too. Dad 
would do a better job of putting 
things together after the war than I 
ever could, anyway. 

I realized, at that moment, that I 
no longer wanted the throne. Even 
if it were available, the prospect of 
administering to the kingdom down 
all the dull centuries that might lie 
before me was overwhelming. 
Maybe I would be taking the easy 
way out if I died in this effort. Eric 
was dead, and I no longer hated 
him. The other thing that had driven 
me — the throne — seemed now to 
have been desirable only because 
I’d thought he had wanted it so. 
I renounced both. What was left? I 
had laughed at Vialle, then won- 
dered. But she had been right. The 
old soldier in me was strongest. It 
was a matter of duty. But not duty 
alone. There was more .... 

I reached the edge of the Pattern, 
quickly made my way toward its 
beginning. I glanced back at the 
cavemouth. Dad, Dworkin, Fiona — 
none of them had yet emerged. 

20 



Good. They could never make it in 
time to stop me. Once I set foot on 
the Pattern, it would be too late foi 
them to do anything but wait and 
watch. 

I thought for a fleeting instant ol 
lago’s dissolution, pushed thai 
thought away, strove to calm m) 
mind to the level necessary for the 
undertaking, recalled my battle wit! 
Brand in this place and his strange 
departure, pushed that away, too 
slowed my breathing, prepared my- 
self. 

A certain lethargy came upon me. 
It was time to begin, but I held 
back for a moment, trying to fix mj 
mind properly on the grand task tha 
lay before me. The Pattern swam 
for a moment in my vision. Now! 
Damn it! Now! No more pre- 
liminaries! Begin, I told myself. 
Walk! 

Still, I stood, contemplating the 
Pattern as in a dream. I forgot about 
myself for long moments as I re- 
garded it. The Pattern, with its long 
black smear to be removed .... 

It no longer seemed importan 
that it might kill me. My mine 
drifted, considering the beauty oi 
the thing .... 

I heard a sound. It would be 
Dad, Dworkin, Fiona, coming. I 
had to do somthing before they 
reached me. I had to walk it, in a 
moment .... 

I pulled my gaze away from the 
Pattern and glanced back toward the 
cavemouth. They had emerged, 
come partway down the slope and 

GALAXY 



halted. Why? Why had they 
stopped? 

Whaf did it matter? I had the 
time I needed in which to begin. I 
began to raise my foot, to step for- 
ward. 

I could barely move. I inched my 
foot ahead with a great effort of 
will. Taking the first step was prov- 
ing worse than walking the Pattern 
itself, near to the end. But it did not 
seem so much an external resistance 
I fought against as it did the slug- 
gishness of my own body. It was 
almost as if — 

Then I had an image of Ben- 
edict beside the Pattern in Tir-na 
Nog’th, Brand approaching, mock- 
ing, the Jewel burning upon his 
breast. 

Before I looked down, I knew 
what I would see. 

The red stone was pulsing in time 
with my heartbeat. 

Damn them! 

Either Dad or Dworkin — or both 
of them — reached through it at this 
instant, paralyzing me. I did not 
doubt that either of them could 
manage it alone. Still, at this dis- 
tance, it was not worth surrendering 
without a fight. 

I continued to push forward with 
my foot, sliding it slowly ahead to- 
ward the edge of the Pattern. Once 
I made it, I did not see how 
they .... 

Drowsing ... I felt myself be- 
ginning to fall. I had been asleep 
for a moment. It happened again. 

When I opened my eyes, I could 

THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



see a portion of the Pattern. When I 
turned my head, I saw feet. When I 
looked up, I saw Dad holding the 
Jewel. 

“Go away,’’ he said to Dworkin 
and Fiona without turning his head 
toward them. 

They withdrew as he placed the 
Jewel about his neck. He leaned 
forward then and extended his hand. 
I took it and he drew me to my 
feet. 

“That was a damn-fool thing to 
do,’’ he said. 

“1 almost made it.’’ 

He nodded. 

“Of course you would have kill- 
ed yourself and not accomplished 
any^ing,’’ he said. “But it was 
well done nevertheless. Come on, 
let’s walk.” 

He took my arm, and we began 
to move about the periphery of the 
Pattern. 

I watched that strange sky-sea, 
horizonless about us, as we went. I 
wondered what would have hap- 
pened had I been able to begin the 
Pattern, what would be happening 
at that moment. 

“You have changed,” he finally 
said, “or else I never really knew 
you.” 

I shrugged. 

“Something of both perhaps. I 
was about to say the same of you. 
Tell me something.” 

“What?” 

“How difficult was it for you, 
being Ganelon?” 

He chuckled. 

21 



“Not hard at all,” he said. “You 
may have had a glimpse of the real 
me.” 

“I liked him. Or, rather, you 
being him. I wonder whatever be- 
came of the real Ganelon?” 

“Long dead, Corwin. I met him 
after you had exiled him from Av- 
alon, long ago. He wasn’t a bad 
chap. Wouldn’t have trusted him 
worth a damn, but then I never trust 
anyone I don’t have to.” 

“It runs in the family.” 

“I regretted having to kill him. 
Not that he gave me much choice. 
All this was very long ago, but I 
remember him clearly, so he must 
have impressed me.” 

“And Lorraine?” 

“The country? A good job, I 
thought. I worked the proper 
shadow. It grew in strength by my 
very presence, as any will if one of 
us stays around for long — as with 
you in Avalon, and later that other 
place. And I saw that I had a long 
while there by exercising my will 
upon its time-stream.” 

“I did not know that could be 
done.” 

“You grow in strength slowly, 
beginning with your initiation into 
the Pattern. There are many things 
you have yet to learn. Yes, I 
strengthened Lorraine and made it 
especially vulnerable to the growing 
force of the black road. I saw that it 
would lie in your path, no matter 
where you went. After your escape, 
all roads led to Lorraine.” 

“Why?” 



“It was a trap I had set for you, 
and maybe a test. I wanted to be 
with you when you met the forces 
of Chaos. I also wanted to travel | 
with you for a time.” 

“A test? What were you testing | 
me for? And why travel with me?” j 
“Can you not guess? I have | 
watched all of you over the years. I i 
never named a successor. I pur- 
posely left the matter muddled. You 
are ^1 enough like me for me to 
know that the moment I declared 
for one of you, I would be signing 
his or her death warrant. No. I in- 
tentionally left things as they were 
until the very end. Now, though, I 
have decided. It is to be you.” 

“You communicated with me as 
yourself, briefly, back in Lorraine. 
You told me then to take the 
throne. If you had made up your 
mind at that point, why did you con- 
tinue the masquerade?” 

“But I had not decided then. 
That was merely a means to assure 
your continuing on. I feared you 
might come to like that girl too 
much, and that land. When you 
emerged a hero from the Black Cir- 
cle, you might have decided to settle 
and stay there. I wanted to plant the 
notions that would cause you to 
continue your journey. ’ ’ 

I was silent for a long while. We 
had moved a good distance about 
the Pattern. 

Then, “There is something that 1 
have to know,” I said. “Before 1 
came here, I was speaking with 
Dara, who is in the process of try- 



ing to clear her name with us — ” 

"It is clear,” he said. “I have 
cleared it.” 

I shook my head. 

“I refrained from accusing her of 
something I have been thinking 
about for some time. There is a 
very good reason why I feel she 
cannot be trusted, despite her pro- 
tests and your endorsement. Two 
reasons, in fact.” 

“I know, Corwin. But she did 
not kill Benedict’s servants to man- 
age her position at his house. I did 
it myself to assure her getting to 
you as she did, at just the appro- 
priate time.” 

“You? You were party to her 
whole plot? Why?” 

“She will make you a good 



queen, son. I trust the blood of 
Chaos for strength. It was time for 
a fresh infusion. You will take the 
throne already provided with an 
heir. By the time he is ready for it. 
Merlin will long have been weaned 
from his upbringing.” 

We had come all the way around 
to the place of the black smear. I 
stopped. I squatted and studied it. 

“You think this thing is going to 
kill you?'’ I finally asked. 

“I know that it is.” 

“You are not above murdering 
innocent people to manipulate me. 
Yet you would sacrifice your life 
for the kingdom.” I looked up at 
him. “My own hands are not 
clean.” I went on, “and I certainly 
do not presume to judge you.

Awhile back, though, when I made 
ready to try the Pattern, I thought 
how my feelings had changed — 
toward Eric, toward the throne. 

“You do what you do, I believe, 
as a duty. I, too, feel a duty now, 
toward Amber, toward the throne. 
More than that, actually. Much 
more, I realized just then something 
that duty does not require of me. I 
do not know when or how it 
stopped and I changed, but I do not 
want the throne. Dad. I am sorry it 
messes up your plans, but I do not 
want to be King of Amber. I am 
sorry.” 

I looked away then, down at the 
smear again. I heard him sigh. 

Then, “I am going to send you 
home now,” he said. “Saddle your 
horse and take provisions. Ride to a 
place outside Amber — any place 
fairly isolated.” 

“My tomb?” 

He snorted and chuckled faintly. 

“That will do. Go there and wait 
my pleasure. I have some thinking 
to do.” 

I stood. He reached out and 
placed his right hand on my shoul- 
der. The Jewel was pulsing. He 
looked into my eyes. “No man can 
have everything he wants the way 
that he wants it,” he said. 

And there was a distancing ef- 
fect, as of the power of a Trump, 
only working in reverse. I heard 
voices, then about me I saw the 
room I had earlier departed. Ben- 
edict, Gerard, Random and Dara 
were still there. I felt Dad release 

24 



my shoulder. Then he was gone and 
I was among them once again. 

“What is the story?” Random 
asked. “We saw Dad sending you 
back. By the way, how did he do 
that?” 

“I do not know,” I said. “But 
he confirms what Dara has told us. 
He gave her the signet and the mes- 
sage.” 

“Why?” Gerard asked. 

“He wanted us to learn to tmst 
her,” I said. 

Benedict rose to his feet. ‘ Then I 
will go and do as I have been bid.” 

“He wants you to attack, then 
fall back,” Dara said. “After that 
it will only be necessary to contain 
them.” 

“For how long?” 

“He said that this will become 
apparent.” 

Benedict gave one of his rare 
smiles and nodded. He managed his 
card-case with his one hand, re- 
moved the deck, thumbed out the 
special Trump I had given him for 
the Courts. 

“Good luck,” Random said. 

“Yes,” Gerard agreed. 

I added my wishes and watched 
him fade. When his rainbow af- 
terimage had vanished, I looked 
away and noticed that Dara was cry- 
ing silently. I did not remark on it. 

“I, too, have orders now — of a 
sort,” I said. “I had best be mov- 
mg. 

“And I will get back to the sea,” 
said Gerard. 

“No,” I heard Dara say as I was 

GALAXY 



moving toward the door. 

I halted. 

“You are to remain here, Gerard, 
and see to the safety of Amber her- 
self. No attack will come by sea.” 
“But I thought Random was in 
charge of the local defense.” 

She shook her head. 

“Random is to join Julian in Ar- 
den.” 

“Are you sure?” Random asked. 
“I am certain.” 

“Good,” he said. “It is nice to 
know he at least thought of me. 
Sorry, Gerard. That’s the breaks.” 
Gerard simply looked puzzled. “I 
hope he knows what he is doing,” 
he said. 

“We have been through that al- 
ready,” I told him. “Good-bye.” 

I heard a footfall as I left the 
room. Dara was beside me. 

“What now?” I asked her. 

“I thought I would walk with 
you, wherever you are going.” 

“I am just going up the hall to 
get some supplies. Then I am head- 
ing for the stables.” 

“I will go with you.” 

“lam riding alone.” 

“I could not accompany you, 
anyway. I still have to spe^ with 
your sisters.” 

“They’re included, huh?” 

“Yes.” 

We walked in silence for a time. 
Then she said, “The whole business 
was not so cold-blooded as it 
seemed, Corwin.” 

We entered the supply room. 
“What business?” 



“You know what I mean.” 

“Oh. That. Well, good.” 

“I like you. It could be more 
than that one day, if you feel any- 
thing.” 

My pride handed me a snappy 
reply, but I bit it back. One learns a 
few things over the centuries. She 
had used me, true, but then it 
seemed she had not been entirely a 
free agent at the time. The worst 
that might be said, I suppose, was 
that Dad wanted me to want her. 
But I did not let my resentment on 
this interfere with what my own 
feelings really were, or could be- 
come. 

So, “I like you, too,” I said, and 
I looked at her. She seemed as if 
she needed to be kissed just then, 
so I did it. “I had better get ready 
now.” 

She smiled and squeezed my 
arm. Then she was gone. I decided 
not to examine my feelings. 1 had 
to get some things together. 

I saddled Star and rode back up 
over the crest of Kolvir until I came 
to my tomb. Seated outside it, I 
smoked my pipe and watched the 
clouds. I felt I had had a very full 
day, yet it was only early afternoon. 
Premonitions played tag in the grot- 
toes of my mind, none of which I 
would have cared to take to lunch. 

III. 

Contact came suddenly as I sat 
drowsing. I was on my feet in an 
instant. It was Dad. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



25 



“Corwin, I have made my deci- 
sions and the time has come,” he 
said. “Bare your left arm.” 

I did this as his form continued 
to grow in substantiality, looking 
more and more regal the while, a 
strange sadness on his face — a 
sort I had never seen there before. 

He took hold of my arm with his 
left hand and drew his dagger with 
his right. 

I watched as he cut my arm, then 
resheathed his blade. The blood 
came forth, and he cupped his left 
hand and caught it. He released my 
arm, covered his left hand with his 
right and drew away from me. Rais- 
ing his hands to his face, he blew 
his breath into them and drew them 
quickly apart. 

A crested red bird the size of a 
raven, its feathers the color of my 
blood, stood on his hand, moved to 
his wrist, looked at me. Even its 
eyes were red, and there was a look 
of familiarity as it cocked its head 
and regarded me. 

“He is Corwin, the one you must 
follow,” he told the bird. “Re- 
member him.” 

Then he transferred it to his left 
shoulder, from whence it continued 
to stare at me, making no effort to 
depart. 

“You must go now, Corwin,” he 
said. “Quickly. Mount your horse 
and ride south, passing into Shadow 
as soon as you can. Hellride. Get as 
far away from here as possible.” 

“Where am 1 going. Father?” I 
asked him. 

26 



“To the Courts of Chaos. You 
know the way?” 

“In theory. I have never ridden 
the distance.” 

He nodded slowly. 

“Then get moving,” he said. “I 
want you to create as great a time 
differential as you can between this 
place and yourself.” 

“All right,” I replied, “but I do 
not understand.” 

“You will, when the time 
comes.” 

“But there is an easier way,” I 
protested. “I can get there faster 
and with a lot less bother simply by 
getting in touch with Benedict with 
his Trump and having him take me 
through.” 

“No good,” Dad said. “It will 
be necessary for you to take the 
longer route because you will be 
carrying something which will be 
conveyed to you along the way.” 
“Conveyed? How?” 

He reached up and stroked the 
red bird’s feathers. 

“By your friend here. He could 
not fly all the way to the Court — 
not in time, that is.” 

“What will he bring me?” 

“The Jewel. I doubt that I will 
be able to effect the transfer myself 
when I have finished what I have to 
do with it. Its powers may be of 
some benefit to us in that place.” 

“I see,” I said. “But I still need 
not ride the entire distance. I can 
trump through after I receive it.” 

“I fear not. Once I have done 
what must be done here, the 



GALAXY 



Trumps will all become inoperative 
for a period of time.” 

“Why?” 

“Because the entire fabric of ex- 
istence will be undergoing an altera- 
tion. Move now, damn it! Get on 
your horse and ride!” 

I stood and stared a moment 
longer. 

“Father, is there no other way?” 

He simply shook his head and 
raised his hand. He began to fade. 

“Good-bye.” 

I turned and mounted. There was 
more to say, but it was too late. I 
turned Star toward the trail that 
would take me southward. 

* it ir 

While Dad was able to play with 
the stuff of Shadow atop Kolvir, I 
had never been able to. I required a 
greater distance from Amber in 
order to work the shifts. 

Still, knowing that it could be 
done, I felt that I ought to try. So, 
working my way southward across 
bare stone and down rocky passes 
where the wind howled, I sought to 
warp the fabric of being about me 
as I headed toward the trail that led 
to Gamath. 

.... a small clump of blue 
flowers as I rounded a stony shoul- 
der. 

I grew excited at this, for they 
were a modest part of my working. 
I continued to lay my will upon the 
world to come beyond each twisting 
of my way. 



A shadow from a triangular 
stone across my path ... a shift- 
ing of the wind .... 

Some of the smaller ones were 
indeed working. A backward twist 
to the trail ... a crevice ... an 
ancient bird’s nest high on a rocky 
shelf . more of the blue flow- 
ers ... 

Why not? A tree . 
another .... 

I felt the power moving within 
me. I worked more changes. 

A thought came to me then, con- 
cerning my newfound strength. It 
seemed possible that it might have 
been purely psychological reasons 
which had barred me from perform- 
ing such manipulations earlier. Until 
very recently I had considered 
Amber herself the single, immutable 
reality from which all shadows took 
their form. Now I realized she was 
but first among shadows, and that 
the place where my fatiier stood 
represented the higher reality. 
Therefore, while the proximity 
made it difficult, it did not make it 
impossible to effect changes in this 
place. Yet, under other cir- 
cumstances, I would have saved my 
strength until I had reached a point 
where it was easier to shift things 
about. 

Now, now though, the need for 
haste lay upon me. I would have to 
exert myself, to rush, to do my 
father’s bidding. 

By the time I reached the trail 
leading down the southern face of 
Kolvir, the character of the land had 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



27 



already changed. I looked upon a 
series of gentle slopes rather than 
the steep descent which normally 
marked the way. I was already en- 
tering Shadowland. 

The black road still lay like a 
dark scar to my left as I headed 
downward, but this Gamath through 
which it had been cut was in 
slightly better shape than that which 
I knew so well. Its lines were soft- 
er, from flocks of greenery which 
lay somewhat nearer the dead 
swath. It was as though my curse 
upon the land were slightly miti- 
gated. Illusion of feeling, of course, 
for this was no longer exactly my 
Amber. But, / am sorry for my part 
in this, I addressed everything men- 
tally, half-prayerlike. I ride now to 
try to undo it. Forgive me, oh spirit 
of this place. My eyes moved in the 
direction of the Grove of the Uni- 
com, but it was far to the west, 
masked by too many trees, for me 
to even glimpse that sacred glade. 

The slope grew more level as I 
descended, becoming a series of 
gentle foothills. I let Star move fast- 
er as we crossed them, bearing to 
the southwest, then finally the 
south. Lower, lower. At a great dis- 
tance to my left the sea sparkled 
and shone. Soon the black road 
would come between us, for I was 
descending into Gamath in its direc- 
tion. No matter what I did with 
Shadow, I would not be able to 
erase that ominous presence. In 
fact, the fastest course I could fol- 
low would be one that paralleled it. 

28 



We came at last to the floor of 
the valley. The Forest of Arden tow- 
ered far to my right, sweeping 
westward, immense and venerable. 

I rode on, working what changes I 
could to bear me even farther from 
my home. 

While keeping the black road on 
hand, I stayed a good distance from 
it. I had to, since it was the one 
thing I could not change. I kept 
shmbs, trees and low hills between 
us. 

I reached out then, and the tex- 
ture of the land changed. 

Veins of agate . heaps of sch- 
ist ... a darkening of the green- 
ery ... 

Clouds swimming across the 
sky ... the sun shimmering and 
dancing .... 

We increased our pace. The land 
sank lower still. Shadows length- 
ened, merged. The forest retreated. 
A rocky wall grew to my right, 
another to my left ... a cold wind 
pursued me down a rough canyon. 
Strata streaks — ^red, gold, yellow 
and brown — flashed by. The floor 
of the canyon grew sandy. Dust dev- 
ils spun about us. I leaned farther 
forward as the way began to rise 
once again. The walls slanted in- 
ward, grew closer together. 

The way narrowed, narrowed. I 
could almost touch either wall .... 

Their tops came together. I rode 
through a shadowy tunnel, slowing 
as it darkened . phosphorescent 
designs burst into being. The wind 
made a moaning noise. 



GALAXY 



Out then! 

The light from the walls was 
blinding, and giant crystals rose all 
about us. 

We plunged past, following an 
upward trail that led away from this 
region and through a series of 
mossy dells where small, perfectly 
circular pools lay as still as green 
glass. 

Tall ferns appeared before us and 
we made our way among them. I 
heard a distant trumpeting noise. 

Turning, pacing ... red now the 
ferns, wider and lower . beyond, 
a great plain, pinking into eve- 
ning .... 

Forward, over pale grasses . 
the smell of fresh earth . moun- 
tains or dark clouds far ahead ... a 
rush of stars from my left ... a 
quick spray of moisture ... a blue 
moon leaps into the sky . flicker- 
ings among the dark masses 
. memories and a rumbling 
noise . stormsmell and rushing 
air ... 

A strong wind . clouds across 
the stars ... a bright fork spearing 
a shattered tree to my right, turning 
it to flame ... a tingling sensa- 
tion ... the smell of ozone . 
sheets of water upon me ... a 
row of lights to my left .... 

Clattering down a cobbled 
street ... a strange vehicle ap- 
proaching . cylindrical, chugging 
. we avoid one another . 
a shout pursues me . through 
a lighted window the face of 
a child .... 



Clattering . splashing . 
storefronts and homes. The rain lets 
up, dies down, is gone. A fog 
blows by, lingers, deepens, is 
pearled by a growing light to my 
left. 

The terrain softens, grows red. 
The light within the mist brightens. 
A new wind from behind, a grow- 
ing warmth ... the air breaks 
apart .... 

Sky of pale lemon . orange 
sun rushing toward noon .... 

A shudder! A thing not of my do- 
ing, totally unanticipated. The 
ground moves beneath us, but there 
is more to it than that. The new 
sky, the new sun, the rusty desert I 
have just now entered — all of them 
expand and contract, fade and re- 
turn. There comes a cracking 
sound, and with each fading I find 
Star and myself alone, amid a white 
nothingness — characters without a 
setting. We tread upon nothing. The 
light comes from everywhere and il- 
luminates only ourselves. A steady 
cracking noise, as of the spring 
thaw come upon a Russian river I 
had once ridden beside, fills my 
ears. Star, who has paced many 
shadows, emits a frightened sound. 

I look all about me. Blurred out- 
lines appear, sharpen, grow clear. 
My environment is restored, though 
with a somewhat washed-out look 
to it. A bit of the pigment has been 
drained from the world. 

We wheel to the left, racing for a 
low hill, mounting it, halting finally 
at its summit. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



29 



The black road. It too seems 
denatured — but even more so than 
the rest. It ripples beneath my gaze, 
almost seems to undulate as I 
watch. The cracking noise con- 
tinues, grows louder .... 

A wind comes out of the north, 
gentle at first but increasing in 
force. Looking in that direction, I 
see a mass of dark clouds building. 

I know that I must move as I 
have never moved before. Ultimates 
of destruction and creation are oc- 
curring at the place I visited — 
when? No matter. The waves move 
outward from Amber and this too 
may pass away — and me along with 
it if Dad cannot pull it all back to- 
gether again. 

I shake the reins. We race south- 
ward. 

A plain . trees . some bro- 
ken building . faster .... 

The smoke of a forest afire . 
a wall of flame . gone .... 

Yellow sky, blue clouds ... an 
armada of dirigibles crossing .... 

Faster .... 

The sun drops like a piece of hot 
iron into a bucket of water, stars 
become streaks ... a pale light upon 
a straight trail . sounds dopplered 
from dark smears, the wail- 
ing .. brighter the light, fainter 
the prospect . gray to my right, 
my left . brighter now . no- 
thing but the trail my eyes to 
ride .... the wailing heightens to a 
shriek . forms run together 
. we race through a tunnel of 
Shadow ... it begins to re- 

30 



volve .... 

Turning, turning . only the 
road is real ... the worlds go 
by ... I have released my control 
of the sets and ride now Ae thrust 
of the power itself, aimed only to 
remove me from Amber and hurl 
me toward Chaos .... There is 
wind upon me and the cry in my 
ears. Never before have I pushed 
my power over shadow to its limit. 
The tunnel grows as slick and seam- 
less as glass. I feel I am riding 
down a vortex, a maelstrom, the 
heart of a tornado. Star and I are 
drehched with sweat .... There is 
a wild feeling of flight upon me, as 
though I am pursued. The road is 
become an abstraction. My eyes 
sting as I try to blink away the 
perspiration. I cannot hold this ride 
much longer . There comes a 
throbbing at the base of my skull. 

I draw back gently upon the reins 
and Star begins to slow. 

The walls of my tunnel of light 
grow grainy . blotches of gray, 
black, white, rather than a uni- 
formity of shading . brown . 
a hint of blue . green. The 
wailing descends to a hum, a rum- 
ble, fading. Gentler the wind . 
shapes come and go ... 
and go ... 

Slowing, slowing .... 

There is no path. I ride on mossy 
earth. The sky is blue, the clouds 
are white. I am veiy lightheaded. I 
draw rein. I — 

Tiny. 

I was shocked as I lowered my 

GALAXY 




eyes. I stood at the outskirts of a 
toy village. Houses I could hold in 
the palm of my hand, miniscule 
roads, tiny vehicles crawling along 
them. 

I looked back. We had crushed a 
number of these diminutive resi- 
dences. I looked all around. There 
were fewer to the left. I guided Star 
carefully in that direction, kept 
moving until we had left that place. 
I felt badly about it — whatever it 
was, whoever dwelled there. But 
there was not a thing that I could 
do. 

I moved again, passing through 
Shadow, until I came to what 
seemed a deserted quarry beneath a 
greenish sky. I felt heavier here. I 
dismounted, took a drink of water, 
walked around a bit. 

I breathed deeply of the damp air 
that engulfed me. I was far from 
Amber now, about as far as one 
ever need go, and well on my way 
to Chaos. I had seldom come this 
far before. While I had chosen this 
place for a rest stop because it rep- 
resented the nearest thing to nor- 
malcy 1 could catch hold of, the 
changes would soon be getting more 
and more radical. 

I was stretching my cramped 
muscles when I heard the shriek, 
high in the air above me. 

I looked up and saw the dark 
form descending, Grayswandir com- 
ing by reflex into my hand. But the 
light caught it at a proper angle as it 
came down, and the winged form 
took fire on its way. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



31 



My familiar bird circled, circled, 
descended to my outstretched arm. 
Those frightening eyes regarded me 
with a peculiar intelligence, but I 
did not spare them the attention I 
might have on another occasion. In- 
stead, I sheathed Grayswandir and 
reached for the thing the bird bore. 

The Jewel of Judgment. 

I knew by this that Dad’s effort, 
whatever it had amounted to, was 
finished. The Pattern had either 
been repaired or botched. He was 
either alive or dead. Choose a 
couple from either column. The ef- 
fects of his act would be spreading 
outward from Amber through 
Shadow now, like the ripples in the 
proverbial pond. I would learn more 
— of them soon enough. In the mean- 
time, I had my orders. 

I drew the chain over my head 
and let the Jewel fall upon my 
breast. I remounted Star. My 
bloodbird emitted a short cry and 
rose into the air. 

We moved again. 

.... over a landscape where the 
sky whitened as the ground dark- 
ened. Then the land flared and the 
sky grew black. Then the reverse. 
And again . .With each stride the 
effect shifted, and as we moved fas- 
ter, it built to a stroboscopic series 
of still-shots about us, gradually 
growing to a jerky animation, then 
to the hyperactive quality of a silent 
film. Finally all was a blur. 

Points of light flashed past like 
meteors or comets. I began to feel a 
throbbing sensation, as of a cosmic 



heartbeat. Everything began to turn 
about me as though I had been 
caught up in a whirlwind. 

Something was going wrong. I 
seemed to be losing control. Could 
it be that the effects of Dad’s do- 
ings had already reached the area of 
Shadow through which I passed? It 
seemed hardly likely. Still .... 

Star stumbled. I clung tightly as 
we went down, not wishing to be 
separated in Shadow. I struck my 
shoulder on a hard surface and lay 
there for a moment, stunned. 

When the world came together 
about me again, I sat up and looked 
around. 

A uniform twilight prevailed, but 
there were no stars. Instead, large 
rocks of various shapes and sizes 
drifted and hovered in the air. I rose 
to my feet and looked all about. 

It was possible, from what I 
could see of it, that the irregular 
stony surface on which I stood was 
itself but a mountain-sized boulder 
drifting with the others. Star rose 
and stood shivering at my side. An 
absolute silence contained us. The 
still air was cool. There was not 
another living thing in sight. I did 
not like this place. I would not have 
halted here of my own volition. I 
knelt to inspect Star’s legs. I 
wanted to leave as soon as possible, 
preferably mounted. 

As I was about this, I heard a 
soft chuckle which might have 
come from a human throat. 

I paused, resting my hand upon 
Grayswandir’ s hilt and seeking the 



32 



GALAXY 



source of the sound. 

Nothing. Nowhere. 

Yet I had heard it. I turned 
slowly, looking in every direction. 
No ... 

Then it came again. Only this 
time I realized that it had its source 
overhead. 

I scanned the floating rocks. 
Shadow-draped, it was difficult to 
distinguish — 

There! 

Ten meters above the ground and 
thirty or so to my left what ap- 
peared to be a human form stood 
atop a small island in the sky, re- 
garding me. I considered it. What- 
ever it was, it seemed too far off to 
pose a threat. I was certain that I 
could be gone before it could reach 
me. I moved to mount Star. 

“No good, Corwin,” called the 
voice I least wanted to hear just 
then. “You are locked here. There 
is no way you can depart without 
my leave.” 

I smiled as I mounted, then drew 
Grayswandir. 

“Let’s find out,” I said. “Come 
bar my way.” 

“Very well,” he replied, and 
flames sprang from the bare rock, 
towering full circle about me, lick- 
ing, sprawling, soundless. 

Star went wild. I slammed 
Grayswandir back into the scabbard, 
whipped a comer of my cloak 
across Star’s eyes, spoke soothing 
words. As I did this, the circle en- 
larged, the fires receding toward 
the edges of the great rock on 



which we stood. 

“Convinced?” came the voice. 
“This place is too small. Ride in 
any direction. Your mount will 
panic again before you can shift 
into Shadow.” 

“Good-bye, Brand,” I said, and 
I began to ride. 

I rode in a large counterclockwise 
circle about the rocky surface, 
shielding Star’s right eye from the 
flames about the periphery. I heard 
Brand chuckle again, not realizing 
what I was doing. 

A pair of large rocks .... Good. 

I rode on by, continuing the course. 
Now a jagged hedge of stone to my 
left, a rise, a dip ... a mess of 
shadow the fires cast across my 
path. There. Down. Up. A touch of 
green to that patch of light. I could 
feel the shifting begin. 

The fact that it is easier for us to 
take a straight course does not make 
it the only way. We all pursue it so 
much of the time, though, that we 
tend to forget that one can also 
make progress by going around in 
circles. 

I could feel the shift more strongly 
as I neared the two large rocks 
again. Brand caught on about then. 

“Hold it, Corwin!” 

I threw him a finger and cut be- 
tween the rocks, heading down into 
a narrow canyon speckled with 
points of yellow light. According to 
specifications. 

I drew my cloak away from 
Star’s head and shook the reins. 
The canyon cut abruptly to the

right. We followed it into a better- 
lighted avenue which widened and 
brightened as we went. 

. .beneath a jutting overhang, 
sky of milk shading to pearl on its 
other side. 

Riding deeper, faster, farth- 
er. A jagged cliff crowned the 
upper talus to my left, greening in 
twisted sign of shrubbery beneath a 
pink-touched sky. 

I rode until the greenery was 
blue beneath a yellow sky, till the 
canyon rose to meet a lavender 
plain where orange rocks rolled as 
the ground was shaken beneath us 
in time with Star’s hoofbeats. I cross- 
ed there under wheeling comets, 
coming to the shore of a blood-red 
sea in a place of heavy perfumes. I 
rode a large green sun and a small 
bronze one out of the sky as I paced 
that shore, while skeletal navies 
clashed and serpents of the deep 
circled their orange- and blue-sailed 
vessels. The Jewel pulsed upon .me 
and I drew strength from it. A wild 
wind came up and lofted us through 
a copper-clouded sky above a wail- 
ing chasm which seemed to extend 
forever, black-bottomed, spark-shot, 
fuming with heady scents. 

At my back the sound of thun- 
der, ceaseless . fine lines, like 
the craqueleur of an old painting, 
abreast of us, advancing, every- 
where. Cold, a fragrance-killing 
wind pursues .... 

Lines ... the cracks widen, 
blackness flows to fill . dark 
streaks race by, up, down, back 



upon themselves. The settling of a 
net, the labors of a gaint invisible 
spider, world-trapping .... 

Down, down and down . the 
ground again, wrinkled and leathery 
as a mummy’s neck . soundless, 
our throbbing passage . softer 
the thunder, falling the wind . 
Dad’s last gasp? Speed now and 
away .... 

A narrowing of lines to the fine- 
ness of an etching, fading then in 
the three suns’ heat . and faster 
yet ... 

A rider approaching . hand to 
hilt in time to my own .... Me. 
Myself coming back? Simultaneous 
our salutes . through one 
another somehow, the air like a 
sheet of water that one dry in- 
stant . What Carroll mirror, 
what Rebma, Tir-na Nog’th effect? 
Yet far, far to my left, a black 
thing writhing. We pace the road 
... it leads me on ... 

White sky, white ground and no 
horizon . sunless and cloudless 
the prospect . only that thread 
of black, far off, and gleaming 
pyramids everywhere, massive, dis- 
concerting. 

We tire. I do not like this place. 
But we have outrun whatever pro- 
cess pursues. Draw rein. 

I was tired, but I felt a strange vi- 
tality within me. It seemed as 
though it arose from within my 
breast. The Jewel. Of course. I 
made an effort to draw upon this 
power again. I felt it flow outward 
through my limbs, barely halting at 



34 



GALAXY 



my extremities. It was almost as 
if— 

Yes. I reached out and lay my 
will upon my blank and geometrical 
surroundings. They began to alter. 

It was a movement. The 
pyramids shuffled by, darkening as 
they passed. They shrank, they 
merged, they passed to gravel. The 
world turned upside-down and I 
stood as on the underside of a 
cloud, watching landscapes flash by 
beneath/above. 

Light streamed past me from a 
golden sun beneath my feet. This, 
too, passed, and the fleecy ground 
darkened, firing waters upward to 
erode the passing land. Lightnings 
jumped up to strike the world over- 
head, to break it apart. In places it 
shattered and its pieces fell about 
me. 

They began to swirl as a wave of 
darkness passed. 

When the light came again, 
bluish this time, it held no point 
source and described no land. 

.... golden bridges cross the 
void in great streamers, one of them 
flashing beneath us even now. We 
wind along its course, standing the 
while still as a statue. For an age, 
perhaps, this goes on. A phenome- 
non not unrelated to highway hyp- 
nosis enters through my eyes, lulls 
me dangerously. 

I do what I can to accelerate our 
passage. Another age goes by. 

Finally, far ahead, a dusky, misty 
blotch, our terminus, growing very 
slowly despite our velocity. 

THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



By the time we reach it, it is 
gigantic — an island in the void, 
forested over with golden, metallic 
trees .... 

I stop the motion which has 
borne us thus far and we move for- 
ward under our own power, enter- 
ing that wood. Grass like aluminum 
foil cmnches beneath us as we pass 
among those trees. Strange fruit, 
pale and shiny, hangs about me. 
There are no animal sounds im- 
mediately apparent. Working our 
way inward, we come to a small 
clearing through which a quicksilver 
stream flows. There, I dismount. 

“Brother Corwin,” comes that 
voice again. “I have been waiting 
for you.” 



IV. 

I FACED THE WOOD, watched him 
emerge from it. I did not draw my 
weapon as he had not drawn his. I 
reached down into the Jewel with 
my mind, though. After the exercise 
I had just completed, I realized that 
1 could do a lot more than control 
weather with it. Whatever Brand’s 
power, I felt I’d a weapon now with 
which to confront it directly. The 
Jewel pulsed more deeply as I did 
this. 

“Tmce,” Brand said. “Okay? 
May we talk?” 

“I do not see that we have any- 
thing more to say to one another,” 
I told him. 

“If you do not give me a chance. 



35 



you will never know for certain, 
will you?” 

. He came to a halt about seven 
meters away, flung his green cloak 
back over his left shoulder and 
smiled. 

“All right. Say it, whatever it 
is,” I said. 

“I tried to stop you,” he said, 
“back there for the Jewel. It is ob- 
vious that you know what it is now, 
that you realize how important it 
is.” 

I said nothing. 

“Dad has already used it,” he 
continued, “and I am sorry to re- 
port that he has failed in what he 
set out to do with it.” 

“What? How could you know?” 

“I can see through Shadow, 
Corwin. I would have thought our 
sister had filled you in more 
thoroughly on these matters. With a 
little mental effort, I can perceive 
whatever I choose now. Naturally I 
was concerned with the outcome of 
this affair. So I watched. He is 
dead, Corwin. The effort was too 
much for him. He lost control of 
the forces he was manipulating and 
was blasted by them a little over 
halfway through the Pattern.” 

“You lie!” I said, touching the 
Jewel. 

He shook his head. 

“I admit that 1 am not above 
lying to gain my ends, but this time 
I am telling the truth. Dad is dead. 
I saw him fall. The bird brought 
you the Jewel then, as he had will- 
ed it. We are left in a universe 

36 



without a Pattern.” 

I did not want to believe him. 
But it was possible that Dad had 
failed. I had had the assurance of the 
only expert in the business, Dwor- 
kin, as to the difficulty of the task. 

“Granting, for the moment what 
you have said, what happens next?’ ’ 
I asked. 

“Things fall apart,” he replied. 
“Even now Chaos wells up to fill 
the vacuum back at Amber. A great 
vortex has come into being, and it 
grows. It spreads ever outward, de- 
stroying the Shadow worlds, and it 
will not stop until it meets with the 
Courts of Chaos, bringing all of 
creation full circle, with Chaos once 
more to reign over all.” 

I felt dazed. Had I struggled from 
Greenwood, through everything, to 
here, to have it end this way? 
Would I see everything stripped of 
meaning, form, content, life, when 
things had been pushed to a kind of 
completion? 

“No!” I said. “It cannot be so.” 

“Unless . .” Brand said softly. 

“Unless what?” 

“Unless a new Pattern is in- 
scribed, a new order created to pre- 
serve form.” 

“You mean ride back into that 
mess and try to complete the job? 
You just said that the place no 
longer exists.” 

“No. Of course not. The location 
is unimportant. Wherever there is a 
Pattern, there is a center. I can do it 
right here.” 

“You think that you can succeed 
GALAXY 



where Dad failed?” 

“I have to try. I am the only one 
who knows enough about it and has 
I sufficient time before the waves of 
I Chaos arrive. Listen, I admit to ev- 
f erything Fiona has doubtless told 
j you about me. I have schemed and 
I I have acted. I have dealt with the 
: enemies of Amber. I have shed our 
blood. I tried to bum out your 
memory. But the world as we know 
it is being destroyed now, and I live 
here too. All of my plans — 
everything! — will come to nothing 
if some measure of order is not pre- 
served. Perhaps I have been duped 
by the Lords of Chaos. It is difficult 
for me to admit that, but I see the 
possibility now. It is not too late to 
foil them, though. We can build the 
new bastion of order right here.” 
“How?” 

“I need the Jewel — and your as- 
sistance. This will be the site of the 
new Amber.” 

“Supposing — arguendo — I give it 
to you. Would the new Pattern be 
exactly like the old one?” 

He shook his head. 

“It could not be, no more than 
the one Dad was attempting to 
create would have been like Dwor- 
kin’s. No two authors can render 
the same story in the same fashion. 
Individual stylistic differences can- 
not be avoided. No matter how hard 
I might try to duplicate it, my ver- 
sion would be slightly different.” 
“How could you do this,” I 
asked, “when you are not fully at- 
tuned to the Jewel? You would need 



a Pattern to complete the process of 
attunement — and, as you say, the 
Pattern has been destroyed. What 
gives?” 

“I said that I would need your 
help,” he stated. “There is another 
way to attune a person to the Jewel. 
It requires the assistance of some- 
one who is already attuned. You 
would have to project yourself 
through the Jewel once more and 
take me with you — into and through 
the primary Pattern that lies be- 
yond.” 

“And then?” 

“Why, when the ordeal is past, I 
will be attuned, you give me the 
Jewel, I inscribe a new Pattern and 
we are back in business. Things 
hold together. Life goes on.” 

“What of Chaos?” 

“The new Pattern will be unmar- 
red. They will no longer have the 
road giving them access to 
Amber.” 

“With Dad dead, how would the 
new Amber be run?” 

He smiled crookedly. 

“1 ought to have something for 
my pains, oughtn’t I? I will be risk- 
ing my life with this, and the odds 
are not all that good.” 

I smiled back at him. 

“Considering the payoff, what is 
to prevent me from taking the gam- 
ble myself?” I said. 

“The same thing that prevented 
Dad from succeeding: all the forces 
of Chaos. They are summoned by a 
kind of cosmic reflex when such an 
act is begun. I have had more ex- 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



37 



perience with them than you. You 
would not have a chance. I might.” 

“Now let us say that you are 
lying to me. Brand. Or let us be 
kind and say that you did not see 
clearly through all the turmoil. Sup- 
posing Dad did succeed? Supposing 
there is a new Pattern in existence 
right now? What would happen if 
you were to do another, here, 
now?” 

“I — It has never been done be- 
fOTe. How should I know?” 

“I wonder.” I said. “Might you 
still get your own version of reality 
that way? Might it represent the 
splitting off of a new universe — 
Amber and Shadow — just for you? 
Might it negate ours? Or would it 
simply stand apart? Or would there 
be some overlapping? What do you 
think, given that situation?” 

He shrugged his shoulders. “I 
have already answered that. It has 
never been done before. How 
should I know?” 

“But I think that you do know, 
or can make a very good guess at 
it. I think that that is what you are 
planning, that that is what you want 
to try— because that is all you have 
left now. I take this action on your 
part as an indication that Dad has 
succeeded and that you are down to 
your last card. But you need me 
and you need the Jewel for it. You 
cannot have either. ” 

He sighed. “I had expected more 
of you. But all right. You are 
wrong, but leave it at that. Listen, 
though. Rather than see everything 



lost, I will split the realm with 
you.” 

“Brand,” I said, “get lost. You 
cannot have the Jewel, or my help, 
I have heard you out, and I thin! 
that you are lying.” 

“You are afraid,” he said, 
“—afraid of me. I do not blame you 
for not wanting to trust me. But you 
are making a mistake. You need mt 
now.” 

“Nevertheless, I have made mj 
choice.” 

He took a step toward me, 
Another .... 

“Anything you want, Corwin. 1 
can give you anything you care to 
n£«ne.” 

“I was with Benedict in Tir-nt 
Nog’th,” I said, “looking through 
his eyes, listening with his ears, 
when you made him the same offer. 
Shove it. Brand. I am going ot 
with my mission. If you think thal 
you can stop me, now is as good a 
time as any.” 

I began walking toward him. I 
knew that I would kill him if I 
reached him. I also felt that I would 
not reach him. 

He halted. He took a step back 
ward. 

“You are making a big mis- 
take,” he said. 

“I do not think so. I think that I 
am doing exactly the right thing.” [ 

“I will not fight with you,” he 
said hastily. “Not here, not above 
the Abyss. You have had yout 
chance, though. The next time thal 
we meet, I will have to take the 



38 



GALAXY 



Jewel from you.” 

“What good will it be to you, 
unattuned as you are?” 

“There still might be a way for 
me to manage it — more difficult, 
but possible. You have had your 
chance. Good-bye.” 

He retreated into the wood. I fol- 
lowed after, but he had vanished. 

* *• * 

I left that place and rode on 
along a road over nothing. I did not 
like to consider the possibility that 
Brand might have been telling the 
truth, or at least a part of it. But the 
things he had said kept returning to 
plague me. Supposing Dad had 
failed? Then I was on a fool’s er- 
rand. Everything was already over. 



and it was Just a matter of time. I 
did not like looking back, just in 
case something was gaining on me. 
I passed into a moderately paced 
hellride. I wanted to get to the 
others before the waves of Chaos 
reached .that far — to let them 
know that I had kept faith, to let 
them see that in the end I had tried 
my best. I wondered then how the 
actual battle was going. Or had it 
even begun yet, within that time 
frame? 

I swept along the bridge, which 
widened now beneath a brightening 
sky. As it assumed the aspect of a 
golden plain, I considered Brand’s 
threat. Had he said what he had 
said simply to raise doubts, increase 
my discomfort and impair my effi-

ciency? Possibly. Yet if he re- 
quired the Jewel, he would have to 
ambush me. And I had a respect for 
that strange power he had acquired 
over Shadow. It seemed almost im- 
possible to prepare for an attack by 
someone who could watch my every 
move and transport himself instan- 
taneously to the most advantageous 
spot. How soon might it come? Not 
too soon, I guessed. First he would 
want to frazzle my nerves — and I 
was already tired and more than a 
little punchy. I would have to rest, 
to sleep, sooner or later. It was im- 
possible for me to go that great dis- 
tance in a single stretch, no matter 
how accelerated the hellride. 

Fogs of pink and orange and 
green fled past, swirled about me, 

40 



filling up the world. The ground 
rang beneath us like metal. Occa- 
sional musical tones, as of rung 
crystal, occurred overhead. My 
thoughts danced. Memories of many 
worlds came and went in random 
fashion. Ganelon, my friend-enemy, 
and my father, enemy-friend, 
merged and parted, parted and 
merged. Somewhere one of them 
asked me who had a right to the 
throne. I had thought it was Gane- 
lon, wanting to know our several 
justifications. Now I knew that it 
had been Dad, wanting to know my 
feelings. He had judged. He had 
made his decision. And I was back- 
ing out. Whether it was arrested de- 
velopment, the desire to be free of 
such an encumbrance, or a matter 
of sudden enlightenment based on 
all that I had experienced in recent 
years growing slowly within me, 
granting me a more mature view of 
the onerous role of monarch apart 
from its moments of glory, I do not 
know. 

I remembered my life on the 
shadow Earth, following orders, 
giving them. Faces swam before 
me— people I had known over the 
centuries — friends, enemies, wives, 
lovers, relatives. Lorraine seemed to 
be beckoning me on. Moire laugh- 
ing. Deirdre weeping. I fought 
again with Eric. I recalled my first 
passage through the Pattern as a 
boy, and the later one when, step 
by step, my memory was given 
back to me. Murders, thieveries, 
knaveries, seductions returned be-

cause, as Mallory said, they were 
there. I was unable to even place 
them all correctly in terms of time. 

There was no great anxiety because 
there was no great guilt. Time, 
1 time, and more time had softened 
I the edges of harsher things, had 
[ worked its changes on me. I saw 
j iny earlier selves as different 
j people, acquaintances I had out- 
j grown. I wondered how I could 
f ever have been some of them. As I 
I rushed onward, scenes from my 
I past seemed to solidify in the mists 
1 about me. No poetic license here. 
Battles in which I had taken part as- 
sumed tangible form save for a 
total absence of sound — the flare of 
weapons, the colors of uniforms, 
banners and blood. 

And people — most of them now 
long dead — moved from my mem- 
ory into silept animation about me. 
None of these were members of my 
family but all of them were people 
who had once meant something to 
me. Yet there was no special pat- 
tern to it. There were noble deeds 
as well as shameful, enemies as 
well as friends— and none of the 
persons involved took note of my 
passage; all were caught up in some 
long-past sequence of actions. 

1 wondered then at the nature 
of the place through which I 
rode. Was it some watered-down 
version of Tir-na Nog’th, with some 
mind-sensitive substances in the vi- 
cinity that drew from me and pro- 
jected about me this This Is Your 
Life panorama? Or was I simply 

THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



begirming to hallucinate? I was 
tired, anxious, troubled, distressed, 
and I passed along a way which 
provided a monotonous, gentle 
stimulation of the senses — the sort 
leading to reverie. In fact, I realized 
that I had lost control over Shadow 
sometime back and was now simply 
proceeding in a linear fashion across 
this landscape, trapped in a kind of 
externalized narcissism by the spec- 
tacle. I realized then that I had to 
stop and rest — ^probably even sleep 
a little — though I feared doing so in 
this place. I would have to break 
free and make my way to a more 
sedate, deserted spot. 

I wrenched at my surroundings. I 
twisted things about. I broke free. 

Soon I was riding in a rough, 
mountainous area and shortly 
thereafter I came to the cave that I 
desired. 

We passed within and I tended 
to Star. I ate and drank just enough 
to take the edge off my hunger. I 
built no fire but wrapped myself in 
my cloak and in a blanket I had 
brought. I held Grayswandir in my 
right hand and lay down facing the 
darkness beyond the cavemouth. 

I felt a little sick. Even though 
Brand was a liar, his words 
bothered me anyway. 

But I had always been good at 
going to sleep. I closed my eyes 
and was gone.

Ban jogging? 

They must 
have pretty 
short memories! 






I’ve been jogging nearly twenty 
years, since I was thirteen. I used to 
swim a lot when I was a kid, but 
after the accident I couldn’t swim 
anymore so I took up jogging. 
Those were the days when ev- 
erybody was Jogging. 

Nowadays there are Just a handful 
of us hardcore guys still running up 
Main Street. Used to be lots. Now 
only a few. It doesn’t bother me. 

The problem is, I want my son to 
be a Jogger too. He’s twelve, and 
like me at his age, all he wants to 
do is swim. Who can blame him? 

Certainly not his mother. She 
doesn’t want him to Jog. 1 don’t 
know why. 

Used to be the public was all for 
Jogging. A guy couldn’t do enough 
of it. It was considered very 
healthy. It increased the community 
good, and everybody was interested 
in the progress of the Joggers. 

Used to be a Joke; A guy would 
get sick and call up a pal and say, 
“Hey, buddy, do my Jogging for 
me, will ya?’’ 

You don’t hear that Joke any- 
more, I can tell you that. 

Nowadays the public is soured on 
Jogging. They say it’s bad for you, 
bad for all of us. At best they say 
it’s unnecessary. 

As if staying in top shape is un- 
necessary. I don’t understand people 
who think like that. 

I know a guy I used to Jog with. 
He quit to take up billiards. It’s 
crazy. “Pool makes more sense to 
me,’’ he says. 



More sense! Can you believe 
that? 

But at least he remembers how 
important Jogging used to be (and 
still is). “Sure it’s good,’’ he says 
“Like putting spin on a ball. You 
get in top condition and you feel 
like you’re doing something valu- 
able. It’s Just that nowadays I figure 
pool makes more sense.” 

Well, what can I tell him? 

The way I see it, he’s out of the 
Club. 

We Joggers are rather clique-ish. 
Especially these days when guys are 
quitting the Road right and left. 
There’s barely a hundred Joggers in 
this burg. But those that are left are 
the best, the strongest, the fastest, 
the meanest and the most dedicated 
bunch of guys I know. 

The hell with the lazy bastards 
who drop out. I say it Just makes 
more room for the rest of us. 

What I really want to do, of 
course, is make room for my kid, 
Jack. 

Jack is twelve, like I said. It’s 
time he took up the Road. 

And he’s not altogether hostile to 
the idea. Sure, he likes his swim- 
ming. I don’t want him to lose out 
on that. But he doesn’t have to Jog 
very long each day. Not like I do. 

I’m still a fanatic Jogger. I go 
pounding up Main Street six hours a 
day. In two shifts, of course. I’m 
not crazy. 

Jack said he’d come along with 
me on a run one of these days. That 
settled it, as far as I’m concerned. I 



JOGGING UP AAAIN STREET

wasn’t worried about him. 

I just had to get my damned wife 
off our backs. 

She thinks I jog too much. 

Well, times have changed. 

Used to be I couldn’t jog enough 
to satisfy her. She was very proud 
of me and my fast mnning. She 
even used to jog with me. (I’d slow 
down and let her dog my heels for a 
few laps, then whoosh — I’d leave 
her panting in the distance. After 
a while I’d come back for her, don’t 
you worry about that. ’Cause when 
we were through with the day’s 
jogging, we’d go to my little cot- 
tage and get some more exercise. 
Know what I mean? Wink, wink.) 

Anyway, now she had this bug 
up her butt about Jack not starting 
out on the Joggers’ Road. It’s 
crazy, like I said. 

Hell, it’s not as though I was 
going to try to put her precious 
daughter on Main Street. You know 
it’s true because Lucy was twelve 
last year and I never said a thing 
about it. She can stay at home and 
fool around, swim, anything she 
wants. I don’t care. 

Not that girls never jogged up 
Main Street. Used to be a lot of 
them. 

(Before I married Sylvia — and, 
yes, after I married her, too — I used 
to go down to Main Street just to 
watch the girls run by. Some of 
those teenage girls jogged past with 
a lot of extraneous movement of the 
fleshier parts of the upper torso, if 
you get my drift. Wink, wink. But 

44 



those days are just about over. 
Damn it.) 

Still, I never offered to put Lucy 
on the Road. I hope Sylvia ap- 
preciates the gesture. Maybe she 
never even noticed. (Fact is. I’m 
kind of hoping Lucy will see Jack 
running with me and decide she’d 
like to give it a try too. But don’t 
get me wrong; I’m not one for du- 
plicity. I’m just cunning and crafty, 
right?) 

So I figured Sylvia was the main 
stumbling block. 

Then I heard some nasty rumors 
that the goddam government might 
ban jogging altogether. 

Incredible. 

The way I see it, they’re attack- 
ing the foundations of life in this 
burg. Maybe I’m prejudiced, but I 
think history will bear me out. 

* -k * 

It’s insane, but after I heard the 
rumors, I began to see for myself. I 
was jogging up Main Street and 
some of my so-called neighbors 
came out to yell at me. “Go on 
back home!’’ they yelled. “Get off 
the street.’’ 

It was incredible! 

I ran on past them without look- 
ing back. It was hard to believe I 
knew some of those people. Some 
of them were my friends. Used to 
be my friends. 

I spotted another jogger up ahead 
of me and I sprinted to catch up. 
The poor guy turned around so fast 

GALAXY 



he nearly fell down. He thought I 
was chasing him. “Damn!” he 
said after I smiled and urged him 
ahead. 

We ran on a little bit until we 
were across the canal and out in the 
country (if you can call it that). 
Then we fell out and flopped down 
on the grass beside a wooden fence. 
There were a couple of cows graz- 
ing off aways. 

We got our breath, then started 
laughing about our encounter. “Re- 
ally,” he said. “I’ve been expect- 
ing somebody to come after me 
with a gun or something. They 
don’t want us to jog anymore.” 

I told him what I’ve already told 
you: “It’s crazy.” 

“I know, but what can we do 
about it?” 

“Do we have to do anything? 
Why not just keep running?’ ’ 

“Yeah, I know,” he said, wiping 
the sweat off his shiny forehead. 
“But what if they really come after 
us? It don’t take much to stop a 
jogger on Main Street.” 

I couldn’t argue with that. It’s a 
lot harder to run than it is to stop a 
guy from running. I remember a 
long time ago, before the accident, 

I used to play a game in a field 
where somebody would grab a ball 
and try to run it past a lot of other 
kids. It was hard work. 

The guy said his name was Tim. 
He was a couple years younger than 
me, but he’d been jogging exactly 
as long. He started back when I 
did, even though he was only ten 

JOGGING UP AAAIN STREET 



or eleven years Old. I told you, 
those were the days when everybody 
jogged. 

Tim was one of the hardcore jog- 
gers. 

He was also married. Two 
daughters, both pretty young and 
(he said) pretty as well. (All fathers 
know their ^ughters are pretty, 
right? Me too.) 

So Tim didn’t have the problem I 
had with Jack. 

Or rather the problem I had with 
Sylvia. 

Unfortunately, we both seemed to 
have an even bigger problem with 
the goddam government. 

Tim said he knew for a fact there 
was a jogging ban in the works. 

“It’s crazy,” I said. 

“I know,” he said. 

After a while he took to the Road 
again. I gave him a five-minute 
start, then hit the line myself. (Ev- 
erybody jogs right up the middle of 
Main Street, right on the center 
line. It’s traditional, sure, but it also 
serves a function. Where else could 
you mn?) 

♦ ★ * 

The next day I decided to sneak 
Jack out of the house and put him 
on the Road. He didn’t object. And 
Sylvia didn’t know about it. 

Even if Jack hadn’t cared to run, 
he would have turned out just to 
show off the jogging suit I got for 
him. It was green, like mine, with 
yellow stripes. (Mine were white.)

We went right to the center of 
town and stood off to the side, doing 
some warm-up exercises. 

It was a good day to run. 

(Hell, it’s always a good day to 
run.) 

But this particular day was beau- 
tiful, cool and crisp, the air so clear 
you could see the whole world. 

We did some deep breathing be- 
fore we started. The air was what 
they used to call “high-altitude 
blend,” but I never knew why. 

It didn’t matter w/iflf they called it. 

It smelled great. 

“Ready?” I said. 

Jack looked a little worried. “If 
you go slow.” 

We stepped out onto Main Street. 
The Baker came out of his shop and 
frowned at us. I ignored him and 
turned to Jack. “You lead off. That 
way you can set the pace.” 

Jack looked both ways up Main 
Street. “Which way?” 

It was a joke. 

“You ought to know by now!” 

He smiled and we started off up 
Main Street, our cushion shoes 
slapping the red line. I have to say 
this, the kid knew where to put his 
feet. He ran like a natural. 

I let him take a short lead so’s 
not to crowd his heels. The pace 
was surprisingly strong. Well, that 
wouldn’t last. First-time runners 
tend to overestimate their stamina. 

We jogged out of town, follow- 
ing Main Street over the canal and 
out between the cow pastures that 
stretched as far as you could see left 



and right. It was a little silly to call 
such a “country” road Main Street, 
but there were never any serious 
plans to rename it. After all — it is 
the street that runs right through the 
center of our little burg, isn’t it? 
And that’s what Main Street is all 
about. 

We saw a farmer out mowing the 
wheat in his little field. Jack waved. 

I guess the farmer didn’t see us. 

A littler farther on we swooped 
into the village. It’s still called 
Main Street through here, of course. 
We were back into some country 
before we knew it. 

Jack was really eating up the 
Road. I was proud of his endurance, 
proud of what we joggers call 
heart. It’s nice to see a boy turn out 
the way you always knew — or 
hoped — he would. 

Nice. 

What a goddam understatement! 

Jack was running up a storm, all 
right. But I knew it wouldn’t last. 

We were a mile and a half out of 
town when he began to crap out. (I 
have to say here that we joggers use 
the measure of “mile” instead of 
the metric system everybody else 
uses. It sets us apart, you know? 
And with sentiment turning against 
us, we need every bit of support we 
can muster. We forni a clique, like 
I said. But mostly it’s for self- 
protection. We’re not snobs or any- 
thing like that. Used to be we got 
together just to keep our spirits up, 
to keep us on the Road, to keep us 
doing what we knew we had to do. 



46 



GALAXY 



Running still hurts, don’t forget. 
We need to keep pushing ourselves 
back out on that Road.) 

Anyway, Jack crapped out so we 
flopped on the side of Main Street 
to t^e a break. 

A minute later Jack was still 
sucking hard at our high-altitude 
blend. “Damn,” he said between 
gasps. “You sure — work hard — out 
here.” 

“That’s right.” 

“And you — go a lot — farther!” 

“I sure do. But don’t let your 
first experience ruin it for you.” 

I decided to let Jack pant in 
peace. I didn’t want him to think I 
was riding him, forcing him to 
jump back on the Road right away. I 
figured it would embarrass him if I 
sat there and stared at him. 

So I wandered off into a field, 
kicking along through the tall grass. 
The sweat was drying on my 
forehead and arms and I felt delici- 
ously cool. I swung my arms 
around and liked the way my shoul- 
ders rolled. I was feeling very phys- 
ical. 

Suddenly it didn’t matter that 
Sylvia and I were having a fight. It 
only mattered that she wasn’t here 
in this grassy field with me. 

I did some quick squats and 
jumps, then went back to see how 
Jack was getting on. I really didn’t 
want to hurry him along. 

It’s just that suddenly there was 
something on my mind. The quicker 
1 got back to the cottage, the 
quicker I could get hold of Sylvia 

JOGGING UP AAAIN STREET 



and straighten this matter out. 

(I’m talking about my matter. 
This fight about jogging could wait. 
You know what I mean? Wink.) 

Jack was a little shaky but ready 
to hit it. 

Again I let him pace us up the 
Road back into town. 1 hoped his 
pride wouldn’t put too much pres- 
sure on him to trudge along faster 
than was comfortable. I knew if I 
ran ahead of him. I’d have to keep 
looking back to see if he was lag- 
ging. And that would have put even 
more pressure on him. 

We slapped the red line on up 
Main Street to what I call “the 
starting line.” (All of us joggers 
have our own “starting lines.”) 

We took a short break. 

Jack asked me if I was going to 
continue jogging. 

“Of course,” I said. “It’s my 
life.” 

I told him the rumored ban 
wouldn’t stop me. He said he meant 
was I going to continue jogging 
now. 

I was thinking about Sylvia, of 
course, but I didn’t want to tell him 
why, exactly. 

But then my feelthy plans were 
shot down when Sylvia walked up, 
looking so goddam betrayed that I 
wanted to apologize immediately for 
plucking baby Jack from her breast. 

Our conversation was short and 
rather bitter. Good thing Jack was 
standing right there. I think she 
wanted to hit me. (Personally I 
think she was over-reacting. Of 

47 



course I knew “jogging” had little 
to do with her anger. She just 
thought I would bow to her inten- 
tions concerning her son. Now she 
knew better. It’s an old story.) 

She took Jack back to the cot- 
tage. I stayed on Main Street. The 
Baker came out of his shop and 
looked like he was about to say 
something sarcastic. 

There was nothing to do but hit 
the Road some more. 

1 took off in a pace that would 
have made Jack cringe. 

I wanted to push myself. To tell 
you the truth, I was feeling mighty 
betrayed myself. I knew Sylvia 
couldn’t read my mind or fathom 
my desires. (She was always a trifle 
slow in these matters.) And I knew 
her scene (with Jack watching) was 
not a flat rejection of that part of 
our relationship. Maybe I knew it 
was nothing /7^rjona/, but 1 couldn’t 
help taking it that way. 

So I pushed myself. 

I was feeling bad. 

I was feeling mean. 

Above all, 1 was feeling frus- 
trated. 

Maybe I could blame Sylvia for 
what happened next. 

At least for my part of it. 

it it ir 

I was just coming into town again 
when I saw the mob. 

Well, maybe “mob” is a bit 
emotional. 

48 



Let’s just say half a dozen guys 
were standing in the Road in my 
path. It looked like they wanted to 
tell me something. 

But I wasn’t exactly in the mood 
for any conversation. Besides, 1 
kind of knew what they wanted to 
say. 

And I certainly wasn’t in the. 
mood to stop running. 

So I uttered a short yell and ran 
right through them. 

They were so surprised half of 
them jumped up and started running 
after me. , 

Then they realized they were 
doing what they wanted me to stop 
doing. They dropped back. 

I watched them over my shoulder 
as they shuffled back to the center 
of town. I had to laugh. 

Up ahead I spotted some runners. 
Naturally they were moving in the 
same direction I was running. But 
they “weren’t getting any farther 
away because 1 was really putting 
on the steam. 

I caught the guys in a quarter of 
a mile. 

I recognized my new running 
friend, Tim. He was pacing a few 
buddies up Main Street. I quickly 
told them what had happened in 
town. They knew all about it. The 
same thing had happened to them. 

“We got to get organized,” 1 
said. “If we go running through 
town in a pack, I don’t see how they 
can stop us. We’d knock ’em ass 
over meatballs.” 

But these guys were already 
GALAXY 



working on the problem. When we 
got to the village, another dozen or 
so joggers joined our group. We all 
laughed and shouted at one another. 

As we made our way up Main 
Street, more and more runners joined 
our convoy. Now there were about 
thirty of us. Even my pool-shooting 
friend had joined us. 

Everybody was running strong 
and mean, strung out in single file, 
smacking the red line in unison. We 
rolled up Main Street like a string 
of ballbearings. 

It was exhilarating. Running had 
never, been better. 

We were flashing through the 
“country,” headed into town. I 
could see we had a reception com- 
mittee waiting for us, but the word 
hadn’t got around town much yet. 
There were only a few dozen mill- 
ing around in the middle of Main 
Street. 

We pounded up the red line and 
growled. 

The mob splashed aside like a 
mud puddle under our sixty pushing 
feet. 

1 heard some screams and angry 
yells but could only laugh as we 
raced out of town, across the canal 
and back into the country. 

God, that felt good. 

The sweat was flowing free by 
now and everybody in the line was 
breathing in marathon cadence. I 
could feel the run adjusting the 
movement of my muscles. I was 
getting my mind set for a long road- 
time. 



I had my running mantra puffing 
through my teeth. 

I felt strong. 

I knew I could run forever. 

Run forever. 

In the old days that was the way 
it seemed to us all. It wasn’t so 
much that we felt we could run 
forever. We just assessed the situa- 
tion and it looked to us like we’d 
have to run forever. 

Times have changed, like I said. 

In the old days everybody ran. 

It was not something you thought 
about much. It was just there. A 
fact of life. A fact that had become 
life. A fact that made life worth liv- 
ing. 

I looked up the line and saw Mr. 
Galway at the head of the joggers. I 
could feel tears coming to my eyes. 

Mr. Galway had to be fifty-five or 
sixty years old. Maybe older. I 
don’t think anybody will ever know 
for sure. (Even my dad looked up 
to this man, I remember.) 

It was only fitting that he should 
lead this line of joggers. He’s the 
man who started the whole thing 
almost twenty years ago. 

He’s the man who saved our 
lives. 

And, more important, he saved 
our spirits. 

It was like having a saint lead our 
little gang up Main Street. 

Suddenly we were chanting the 
Joggers’ Chant. 1 don’t know who 
started it. With forty or fifty of us 
running, I think the Chant just came 
out spontaneously. 



JOGGING UP /4AIN STREET 



49 



“Up the hill!” we shouted. 

“Down the hill!” 

“All the way!” 

“All the way!” 

“Around the hill!” 

“Through the hill!” 

“All the way!” 

“All the way!” 

1 fit the Chant around my running 
mantra like a cloak. 

Everything was filled up now, 
muscles, lungs, throat and mind. 

We ran the finest run. 

“All the way!” 

“All the way!” 

I looked up, up in the sky. We 
were thundering through the village, 
which is halfway around from the 
town. That meant the town was just 
another mile away and directly 
overhead. 

I looked up in the sky, following 
the red line of Main Street all the 
way up into town. The town was 
exactly the diameter of our little 
burg — about six-tenths of a mile. It 
was possible to see a large crowd 
clogging the street in the center of 
town. 

The word had gone out. 
Apparently the government was 
bent on stopping us. There would 
be no more running up Main Street. 
Running up Main Street. 

I remembered when Jack asked 
me why runners only ran up Main 
Street and not down. (By “down” 
he meant, of course, in the direction 
of spin.) The answer was simple. 

Now, as we swept around the 
curve toward the town, I thought 

50 



about the answer I gave him then 
and it presented such a simple solu- 
tion to this whole anti-jogging 
fiasco that I almost tripped over my 
own feet. 

A second later I had left the red 
line (for the first time in my life) 
and was running past a lot of in- 
credulous, chanting joggers toward 
Mr. Galway. 

It was hard going. The pace was 
murder, and I was not exactly a 
fresh runner. 

Then again, neither was I a 
novice. 

I knew where the reserves lay. 

I tapped them . and speeded 
up. 

The Chant was petering out. Ev- 
ery time I passed another jogger, he 
stopped chanting and yelled at me. 
Luckily the guys ahead of me were 
chanting too loud to notice what was 
going on behind them. If one of 
them had turned and looked back, I 
might never have made it to the 
front. 

I reached Mr. Galway with less 
than a hundred yards to go. It was 
hard to believe a man of his years 
was responsible for the killing pace. 
He seemed to be cruising. 

It turned out he was as horrified 
as anyone that I was running along 
off the red center-of-mass line. 1 
could see he was angry. I thought 
for a moment he might knock me 
down. 

But instead he listened to my 
breathless plan. 

And he saw I was right. 



GALAXY 



* * * 



It was harder than I’d thought to 
stop our jogline. I’m afraid some 
faces got punched, some bodies 
trampled and some harsh words 
thoughtlessly shouted before the 
whole bunch of us — runners, 
government leaders, goons and 
nibbemeckers — could begin a more 
or less controlled shouting match. 

Somewhere in the middle my 
plan was proposed, explained, de- 
bated, voted in and proclaimed 
law. 

It was simply this: Odd days jog- 
gers jog up Main Street; even days 
jog down. 

Joggers could keep informal logs 
to make sure the effects of the odd 
days were canceled on the even 
days. 

All this because in the twenty 
years since the accident when we 
lost spin and couldn’t control the 
spin rockets and couldn’t go EVA 
to fix them because of the radiation, 
we had run our ship up to half a 
gee spin-gravity. 

It was felt by the government that 
this was more than enough to keep 
the calcium from migrating out of 
our bones and quite sufficient to 
keep us in good physical health 
until we reached the terminus. 

The terminus. 

Well, hopefully Jack will be 
around for that little event. 

We’re still ten years from Turn- 
around, with another forty years or 

JOGGING UP AAAIN STREET 





so after that to the Centauri system. 
If I made it. I’d be eighty-four. 
Well, I guess I got a chance. My 
own dad was killed after the 
accident — he was one of those who 
went EVA to see what could be 
done about our spin loss. He never 
knew what a lot of heroes we jog- 
gers became. 

Lately “hero’’ didn’t exactly de- 
scribe us. 

(I found out later that the 
government was merely preparing to 
discourage full-scale jogging. After 
all, we had to stop increasing our 
spin sometime. People were begin- 
ning to complain about getting too 
heavy. The government considered 
it a matter to look into. There was 
no crisis. It was when I — and some 
other hotheads — bulled though town 
at high speed that things got out of 
hand. We joggers, were known to be 
clique-ish. Suddenly the government 
was afraid we’d turn militant. They 
got tough and we got tougher. The 
whole thing was blown up out of 
proportion in a matter of minutes.) 

Anyway, after the crowd had yell- 
ed a lot and talked loud another 
hour or so, it began to disintegrate. 

Most of the joggers left too. 
They’d made their point. 

Years ago you used to hear the 
phrase, “Joggers make the world go 
around.” Believe it. 

It’s true. 

It was especially true in the first 
five years or so after the accident. 
Everting was chaotic. Thank God 
we still had some spin left — about 

52 



point one gee. 

But with all the hardship and 
turmoil, Mr. Galway saw to it that 
one operation continued relentlessly. 
The joggers pounded up Main 
Street, running so close together 
you could reach out and grab the 
guy ahead of you, four thousand 
men, women and children, all run- 
ning at once, continuously (there 
were four shifts), every second of 
every minute of every hour — for 
five and a half years. 

And by the end of this crucial 
period we’d put another point two 
seven rpm’s on our ship — exactly 
doubling the spin rate we had after 
the accident. It was enough to 
quadruple our spin-gravity. 

After that — and for the next four- 
teen years — the hardcore joggen 
took over. It’s taken that long to 
add that last tenth gee. 

“Joggers make the world go 
around.” 

It’s still true. 

Tim grabbed my arm. “Let’s 
run!” 

It was an even numbered day, by 
our peculiar reckoning, so we 
turned to face the down side of 
Main Street. “Okay,” I said. “But 
only one lap. I have to get back 
home and look after my . son.” 

A small lie between joggers. 

We started off down the street. 

I don’t care what anyone says. 

It’s easier running down Main 
Street. 

I said, “Maybe I’ll just do two 
laps. ...” *

From LUCIFER’S HAMMER by 
Lairy Niven and Jerry Poumelle 
Playboy Press, 1977 

For the past three years these 
columns have been a joint affair: 
often Jim Baen suggests the topic 
and always we have a long tele- 
phone discussion before I write 
them. This will be the last of those. 
As I write this, Jim has left 
GALAXY to become the science- 
fiction editor at ACE Books. While 
I’m looking forward to working 
with the new editor, J. J. Pierce, 
I’m going to miss Jim, and I think 
so will we all. Thanks, Jim. I wish 
you well. 

This topic was chosen before Jim 
left. There I was, admiring Larry’s 
and my new book when the tele- 
phone rang and Jim asks, “Why 
don’t you do a column about what 
would happen if a big comet hit the 
Earth?” 

53 



“Uh — well, it wouldn’t be hard 
to do, but are you sure the readers 
won’t think I’m picking up a bit of 
free advertising?” I asked modestly. 

“So what? It’s an interesting top- 
ic, and I, uh, suspect you can do 
the research easily enough,” said 
Jim. 

“Done,” I cried. And here we 
are. 

★ ★ ★ 

First, what are the chances that 
any large object will strike the 
Earth? Secondly, if something hits, 
how great is the chance that it will 
be a comet? 

High, in both cases. But that takes 
explanation. In any given century, 
any given millenium, the chances 
that we’ll be struck by anything 
large enough to do more than make 
loud noises, and perhaps knock 
down a building or two, are very 
low. Death by meteor strike isn’t 
exactly prevalent; I suspect that 
Lloyd’s would insure you against it 
for a premium not much higher than 
the administrative costs of recording 
the policy. 

In fact, in all history I know of 
only one person who has been in- 
jured by a falling meteorite, and she 
got her picture in LIFE as a result. 
(As I recall, her landlady wanted to 
claim the fallen star, on the grounds 
that it may have hit the tenant but 
it ended up in the landlady’s base- 
ment.) 

That being the case, how can I 



say that the probability that Earth 
will be struck is high? 

Look at Mars. It’s covered with 
craters. So are its moons, Phobos 
and Deimos. Now some of that is 
due to Mars’ thin atmosphere, 
which doesn’t protect the surface; 
but most of those holes in the Mar- 
tian surface were made by globs 
that would have punched through 
our own atmosphere without hardly 
noticing. Mars has been battered 
throughout geological history. 

But Mars is in the inner edges of 
the Asteroid Belt. Surely it gets hit 
more often? 

No. Look at Mercury. Or Venus. 
Or our own Moon. It turns out that 
Mars’ position in the solar system is 
irrelevant; all the inner planets, 
Mercury, Venus, Earth-Moon, Mars, 
have approximately equal chances of 
being struck. 

And look at our globe; Vreed- 
evort in South Africa, so large an 
astrobleme (a blemish caused by an 
astronomical object; nice word) that 
you can’t even see it except from 
the air. Or Meteor Crater in 
Arizona, a kilometer-sized hole. 
And those were the little ones. 
Look at the globe again. 

Circles. Hudson’s Bay. The Sea 
of Japan. Two circles forming the 
Gulf of Mexico. The Bay of Ben- 
gal. Perhaps not all of those are 
astroblemes but it’s likely that one 
or more was. 

And of course there were myriads 
more but the scars have worn away 
over the ages. Our atmosphere is ef- 



54 



GALAXY 



ficient at erasing marks on the 
Earth’s surface — and of course 
we’re four/fifths covered by water 
so that not all the scars show to 
begin with. Over geological time 
we’ve been struck again and 
again — and over a long enough time 
we’re bound to be struck. The 
probability is very high, given that 
we wait long enough. More on that 
later. 

Now — given that we’ll get hit, 
what are the chances that it will be 
a comet? High, of course; objects 
with intersecting orbits have had 
plenty of chances to hit and most 
of those that were going to have 
done so except for the comets, 
whose periods are so long that they 
haven’t had many chances at us. 

A number of highly reputable as- 
tronomers estimate that there are 
upwards of a billion comets. 
They’re mostly way out beyond 
Pluto in what’s called the cometary 
halo. Every now and again one gets 
perturbed out of its far-out orbit and 
falls down near the Sun. 

Most astronomers think comets 
are dirty snowballs; various ices, 
water, methane, carbon dioxide, 
balled together and contaminated 
with dust rocks and general cos- 
mic junk. When the comet gets 
close to the Sun — say, out there by 
Mars — it heats up. The ices turn to 
gas, and the gasses with dust stream 
out. Light pressure from sunlight 
pushes the tail away from the 
comet so that it smears across the 
sky. As the comet gets closer, more 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



stuff melts, the tail gets larger, and 
it can become really spectacular. 

Then, just as the textbooks show, 
when the comet rounds the Sun, the 
tail continues to be pushed away 
from the head; the light pressure 
works outward only. Thus on its 
way back out, the tail goes first; 
assbackwards through the solar sys- 
tem. 

Each time the comet gets down 
near the Sun it loses all the gasses 
and dust that went into making up 
the tail. None of that can be recov- 
ered. Eventually there’s nothing left 
but a few rocks. 

As a matter of fact, as I write 
this, we’re being hit by cometary 
matter. The Perseid meteor shower 
takes place this week (mid-August), 
and those campjed out on the 
Mojave to watch the first free flight 
of the Enterprise got a spectacular 
light show as an extra attraction. 
The regular meteor showers such as 
the Perseids are generally if not 
universally thought by astronomers 
to be the remnants of comets in or- 
bits with periods short enough to 
have brought them many times into 
the solar system. The ices have long 
since burned away, leaving nothing 
more than a mess of flying gravel. 

Of course 1 don’t recommend that 
everyone go make preparations for 
getting hit by a comet. (If you de- 
cide to do so, you’ll get tips in 
plenty from the novel.) The chances 
that Earth will during your lifetime 
be hit by anything big are tiny in- 
deed. Even over thousand-year 



55 



periods the probability is not high. 
Our novel deals with the probable 
consequences of a very improbable 
event, and we didn’t write it to 
scare anyone (well, we did, but you 
know what I mean). 

But it is inevitable that if we wait 
long enough and do nothing about 
it. Earth is going to be hit by a 
comet. 

So what? Comets are nothing 
more than dirty snowballs. Frozen 
gas can’t harm us. Can it? 

It surely can. Let’s take a simple 
case, a chunk of ice one mile on a 
side. That works out to 4.17 x 10'® 
cubic centimeters; now let’s choose 
a density. Liquid methane is .424 
grams per cc; methane ice is more 
dense than that, but let’s assume we 
have a lot of even lighter contamin- 
ants, so that our density is only half 
that of liquid methane, and multiply 
by .212, giving us a mass of 8.8 x 
10'^ grams, no small sum. 

Now for a velocity. Let’s assume 
the thing is going past and we whap 
into it at something like Earth’s 
path velocity in orbit, about 25 
kilometers a second. This is reason- 
able; the closing velocity of most 
meteorites that do hit our atmos- 
phere varies from about 10 to about 
70 kilometers a second. Using 
high-school formula, energy =14 
mv^, we get 2.76 x 10*’ ergs, a 
number that doesn’t mean too 
much, so let’s translate: It’s 65,748 
megatons, somewhat more energy 
than is contained in all the nuclear 
arsenals of all nations. 



Put another way: It takes 980 
calories to turn a gram of water into 
steam. If we assume the water 
started at the freezing point and 
that all the energy from the strike is 
used to generate steam, we’d have 
enough water vapor to cover the en- 
tire North American continent to a 
depth of well over 200 meters. 

Fortunately not all that energy 
gets used that way but however 
you look at it, if our snowball hits 
water, it’s going to rain. We put it 
this way: 

“Cubic miles of water have been 
vaporized, and the rain clouds en- 
circle the Earth. Cold fronts form 
along the base of the Himalaya 
massif, and rainstorms sweep 
through northeastern India, northern 
Burma, and China’s Yunan and 
Szechwan provinces. The great riv- 
ers of eastern Asia, the Brah- 
maputra, Irrawaddy, Salween, 
Mekong, Yang-tze and Yellow riv- 
ers, all begin along the Himalaya 
foothills. Floods pour down across 
the fertile valleys of Asia, and still 
the rains fall in the highlands. Dams 
burst and the waters move on until 
finally they meet the storm-lashed 
salt water driven inland by waves 
and typhoons. 

“As the rains fall across the 
Earth, more steam rises from the 
hot seas near Hammerstrikes; with 
the water go salt, soil, rock dust, 
vaporized elements of the Earth’s 
crust. Volcanoes send more billions | 
of tons of smoke and dust rising 
into the stratosphere.

described in our book, if you’re that 
interested, along with what happens 
to the survivors. 

But there’s a point to all this and 
j it’s not trying to entice you to rush 
I out and buy a book, nor am I sell- 
j ing survival kits. 

' The point is, it’s bound to hap- 
I pen. Not this year, not this century, 
not this millenium — perhaps. There’s 
no way of knowing. What did hit 
Siberia back in 1908? Black Hole? 
Comet? No one knows, but some- 
thing did and it was big enough to 



have caused a lot of damage had it 
struck anywhere but in the most des- 
olate area of Earth. 

Has something like this happened 
in human memory? Probably not — 
but it’s possible. Allow me to in- 
dulge in some speculation. 

From about 1600 BC to 1200 BC 
a very high civilization flourished 
in Europe. It was centered around 
Crete originally, but something, 
probably associated with the erup- 
tion of the volcanic island of Thera 
seventy miles north of Crete, 
brought the Minoan civilization 
down. 

Yet, despite one of the most dev- 
astating events in all history— the 
Thera eruption has been estimated 
at from four to ten times as power- 
ful as Krakatoa, and Krakatoa killed 
thirty-six thousand people — the Ae- 
gean civilization recovered. The 
hundred-megaton volcanic explosion 
finished Crete but the mainland 
Greeks, led by the kings at 
Mycenae, rose as the Cretans fell. 
They took the Cretan script— known 
to archaeologists as Linear A — and 
adapted it for Greek. They had a 
highly organized economy domi- 
nated by the palaces. They traded 
all through the Mediterranean. 

We know a good bit about how 
they lived from the Homeric poems. 
We can read the palace archives, 
find out just what the kings at Pylos 
dedicated to their gods, what mea- 
sures they took for their defense; we 
can -see their trade goods placed in 
Egyptian tombs. It was a high 



56

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



57 



civilization indeed, and it lasted for 
a century after Thera. Then it fell 
suddenly. Within a generation, pos- 
sibly a few years, possibly more 
quickly than that. Populations fell 
from millions to fractions of that. 

And no one knows why. There 
are dozens of theories. Rhys Car- 
penter postulates vast and massive 
climate changes. The traditional ex- 
planation is invasion by barbarians. 
None of the theories are very satis- 
factory. None really explain why 
the art of writing was lost for cen- 
turies; why cities with massive 
walls and fortifications were de- 
serted and never again occupied 
until their very locations were lost 
to memory. 

Leon Pomerance of the Ar- 
chaeological Institute of America 
finds existing theories so unsatisfac- 
tory that he has tried to redate the 
Thera explosion to 1200 BC. He 
has not gained much acceptance for 
his view; the Thera event can be 
dated in various ways but it’s very 
hard to make it later than 1400; 
most put it earlier than that. There 
are the remains of Minoan settle- 
ments on the island and those can 
be correlated with a time in Egypt 
known to be centuries before the 
great collapse and the beginning of 
the First Dark Age. 

Yet Pomerance makes one point 
very persuasively: No other barbar- 
ians in history have been so effi- 
cient at killing as these hypothetical 
people must have been to bring 
down such a great civilization. Not 



only did they kill off those arrogant 
Achaean warriors described by 
Homer but they destroyed a 
flourishing civilization in Phoenicia, 
wrecked Syria and then managed to 
do in most of their own people. Not 
a very satisfactory picture. 

Others postulate an economic 
view: The palace economy was so 
tightly knit that once it was dis- 
turbed, the land could not produce 
enough to feed the swollen popula- 
tion; progressive decline set in and 
the Achaeans were their own “bar- 
barian invaders.” That view has its 
problems too: These progressively 
declining people were able to get 
around to a lot of territories. 

But perhaps. However, there is 
another possibility, one of pure 
speculation: Phaeton. Recall the 

legend? Phaeton, illegitimate child 
of the Sun, asked his father a favor, 
and when it was granted, chose as 
his boon the right to drive the Sun 
chariot. The result was disaster, 
with the Sun getting so close to 
Earth that it scorched many lands; 
Zeus finally destroyed Phaeton with 
a thunderbolt and he fell into the 
sea. 

Interestingly, Phaeton in legend 
has often been associated with dev- 
astating floods. 

Could a large meteor have struck 
the Mediterranean just after 1200 
BC, just after the Trojan War? At 
least the possibility is intriguing. 
Suppose it to have been a bit small- 
er than our cubic mile of methane 
ice and to have come in at a shal- 



low angle. It would have left a 
swath of destruction fifty miles on 
either side; that shock wave would 
be devastating. 

When it plunged into the sea, it 
would throw up tsunamis great 
enough to scour the seashore. There 
would probably be climatic effects. 

All pure speculation, of course. I 
offer no real evidence for the 
theory, nor do I care to defend it as 
anything more than a “cocktail 
party” idea. 

I am dead serious when I say that 
worse inevitably will happen if we 
wait long enough. 

In our story we have an event 
something larger than Phaeton; 
larger even than the cubic mile of 
ice. It’s still pretty small compared 
to whatever happened to form Hud- 
son’s Bay or whatever cracked the 
Moon wide open a billion years 
ago. For obvious reasons we 
couldn’t write a novel about that 
kind of disaster. It’s hard to write 
about the survivors when you have 
a pasteurized planet. We were, after 
all, writing a novel. No one would 
want to read a fiction about the total 
end of humanity. That doesn’t make 
the possibility any less real. 

V^at might we do about it? Or 
are we all doomed, it being only a 
question of time before Earth is bat- 
tered to death? 

Well, first we can plant colonies. 
As Robert Heinlein observed last 
year on Viking Night, “Earth is too 
small and fragile a basket for the 
human race to keep all its eggs in.” 



As I write this, there’s joy in 
Palmdale: The Shuttle, despite Vice 
President Mondale’s adamant oppo- 
sition, has successfully flown her 
first untethered mission. About the 
time you read this I’ll be at NASA 
Ames to participate in a symposium 
on space industrialization. 

We can’t plant colonies yet, but it 
may not be long. Incidentally, there 
arrived in today’s mail NASA’s 
publication SPINOFF 1977, all 
about new uses of space technology 
in everyday life. Mine was sent 
courtesy of the National Space Insti- 
tute (1911 N. Fort Myer Drive, 
Suite 408, Arlington, Va. 22209; 
dues $15 yearly). 

With self-sufficient colonies on 
Mars, and the Moon, and in space 
itself, we could lose the Earth and 
still survive as a race. John Varley 
has a series in which man cannot 
live on Earth any longer but hasn’t 
got out of the solar system. And of 
course there’s the possibility of re- 
colonizing the Earth with survivors 
from the colonies. 

But beyond that — is there any rea- 
son why space-faring man cannot 
save the home world? Given the 
ships and colonies, there is more 
than a possibility that we could 
quite literally push our nemesis off 
course. A few thousand megatons 
applied at the right time and place 
would do the job handily. 

The next time somebody tells you 
we must give up technology in 
order to “save the ecology,” think 
about that one. ★

A story guaranteed to of- 
fend everyone’s sensibil- 
ities. Or hit their funny- 
bones! 



ItIy name is ISAAC BENSON and 
I’m not Jewish. I’m a physicist and 
because of that name and my looks, 
most people think I’m Jewish. I 
don’t do much to disabuse them 
because I have found that it has 
helped my career. 

It’s true that most people try not 
to be prejudiced, but it’s not easy. 
When old Professor Levi, my 
graduate advisor, found out I wasn’t 
Jewish, he tapped his index fingers 
together gently, the way he does 
when he is thinking deep mathemat- 
ical thoughts. He peered at me from 
under those gigantic white eyebrows 
and said mildly, “But Isaac, some 
of my best friends are gentiles. You 
could have trusted me.’’ 

I knew, however, that old Levi, 
like so many other physicists, 
secretly believed that the herit- 
age that gave us Einstein and Op- 
penheimer, Michelson and Wein- 
berg and so many others was due to 
the fact that being Jewish gives a 
person a special added talent for 
theoretical physics, like the secret 
added ingredient in a new brand of 
floor wax. Anyhow, because of my 
name and because I am a slightly 
stocky thirtyish ex-boy genius with 
coal-black eyes, long thick dark hair 



and a prominent nose on my per- 
manently lightly tanned skin, and 
because I have a vestigial tendency 
to observe the Sabbath (I’m a 
natural-bom Seventh Day Adven- 
tist), only my close friends know 
I’m really not one of the Tribe. 

Oh, yes. I also love to drink. My 
Jewish friends (and what other sort 
does a theoretical physicist have?) 
tell me that that’s how they can tell 
I’m really not Jewish. They all 
seem to prefer stimulants, like caf- 
fein, rather than nice soothing de- 
pressants, like alcohol, that quiet 
the sullen voice of conscience and 
let a fellow have some fun once in 
a while. 

Alcohol does something else for 
me, something I really need; It 
stops the endless flow of invention 
ideas. Since I was a little kid wan- 
dering around the campus of Atlan- 
tic Union College (where my father 
taught mechanical drawing), I’ve 
been plagued by a psychic diarrhea 
of ideas for almost dways absurd 
inventions. It wouldn’t be so bad if 
I could think up nice practical 
schemes like how to solve the 
energy crisis or make a self- 
changing diaper. Instead, a typical 
hour’s production may include a 
plan for correcting software errors 
in a computer whose circuits consist 
of plasma created by holographic 
replication of the plasma, a way to 
improve the long-range carrying 
power of cockroach sex attractant, 
and a way to tell how many days 
ago spoiled yogurt started to spoil. I 



THE HOLY TEMPLE 



61 



admit I’ve cheated a bit; these ideas 
actually came to me this morning 
over an interval of about three 
hours. There were, of course, dur- 
ing that time dozens of others. I 
chose those three because they show 
how nutty my ideas tend to be, and 
how varied. 

By now I’ve learned just not to 
listen to all those ideas: I can’t turn 
off the damn station but I can tune 
it out, more or less. However, I am 
convinced that tuning it out takes 
some sort of psychic energy. That’s 
where my love for alcohol comes 
in: When I am sufficiently drunk, the 
ideas stop. Then of course I become 
far more intelligent because I am 
not exhausted and distracted by all 
that subjective clamor. 

I’ve tried to control the subject 
matter of my inventions. I can’t. 
The only time the system ever got 
focused was for two terrible weeks 
when I was fourteen during which I 
must have come up with hundreds 
of ideas for aphrodisiacs for women 
and anaphrodisiacs for males other 
than myself. Every idea would have 
worked — given money, technology 
and raw materials utterly beyond 
reach. If I get sent to hell and they 
put me in that desert where the 
water is always just out of reach. 
I’ll just laugh. After my experience, 
age fourteen, I’ve been understand- 
ably very, very tentative in my later 
efforts to focus my talent. 

Anyhow, toward the point of my 
story — if not exactly to it. One day 
I did have an idea that seemed 



worth following up, an idea that 
looked like it might help solve some 
of the big differences between Israel 
and her Moslem neighbors. It also 
would provide an important practi- 
cal application for the relatively 
pure branch of experimental physics 
in which I had sp>ecialized (mostly 
because Levi was the biggest shot 
that would take me on as advisee). 

My specialty was the theory of 
large-scale holography. By large I 
mean fractions of a kilometer you 
can write with only one decimal 
digit in the denominator, which puts 
a lower limit of one hundred eleven 
meters. When holograms get that 
big, there is a whole new class of 
problems to contend with that can- 
not even be measured, let alone 
noticed, in traditional teeny-weeny 
holograms. In my new, large-sized 
range you have to worry about vari- 
ations in the earth’s gravitational 
field disrupting wave-front register. 

My idea was for a way to create 
a giant hologram that could be 
turned on and off by the flip of a 
switch. It was a practical way: That 
is, it could be built for not much 
more than three or four billion 
bucks. And I saw a splendid appli- 
cation. 

Why not make the holy Temple in 
Jerusalem by hologram? Why not 
project it over and around the pres- 
ent Mosque of Omar? In fact, that 
structure could be integrated into 
the structure of the holographic pro- 
jection so that the walls of the 



62 



GALAXY 



Mosque fitted with the walls of the 
imaged Temple. 

Imagine! The Temple could be 
turned on for the Jewish Sabbath 
and holy days. It could be turned 
off at other times. There need be no 
destruction or damage of the present 
Mosque. In fact, several different 
holograms could be projected by the 
same projection system, including 
versions of the Temple designed to 
fit various alternative sectarian 
views. There could be a Catholic 
Temple, a Reform Jewish, an Or- 
thodox Jewish, a Babbist, even a 
Marxist Temple designed to look 
shabby and tawdry. What a way to 
satisfy everybody! The ancient 
prophecies could be fulfilled. Every 
ancient prophecy, including all con- 
tradictory ones! 

Of course, with my background, 
I didn’t have immediate access to 
anyone in a position to implement 
my idea. My Princeton friends were 
too — shall we say — secular; cer- 
tainly no one I had hung around 
with during my freshman year at 
Atlantic Union College could possi- 
bly have the right connections. 

Therefore I worried about how 
to find someone to help me imple- 
ment my brainstorm for three inter- 
minable seconds before I finally 
thought of my mad-genius friend, 
Leonard Bachutz. 

Len Bachutz had been a fellow 
graduate student in physics at 
Princeton and we had even pub- 
lished a paper together — a lovely 
theoretical proof of an obscure as- 

THE HOLY TEMPLE 



trophysical speculation by Lyman 
Spitzer — before we became too ab- 
sorbed in our doctoral researches to 
take time for something as frivolous 
as publication in professional jour- 
nals. 

Len was generally regarded as the 
most capable graduate student in 
our class. Maybe not another Wein- 
berg, but definitely an order of 
magnitude more talented than the 
rest of us clods. The legend was 
that he and Levi used to lock them- 
selves in Levi’s lab late at night and 
summon up the ghost of Op- 
penheimer. Levi is a staunch expo- 
nent of the fundamental indetermi- 
nacy of quantum processes, and 
hence the fundamental unpredicta- 
bility of everything. Oppenheimer, 
as everyone knows, followed Ein- 
stein in believing that underneath the 
chaos was a strict, predetermined 
order. Naturally then, the story 
went that Levi and Bachutz would 
summon Oppenheimer’s ghost just 
to taunt him with the question: “If 
the universe is perfectly logical and 
predictable then what are you 
doing here?” 

I’d better interrupt myself here to 
explain to the reader that the last 
paragraph was a joke intended to 
show the awe that the other grad 
students felt concerning Len 
Bachutz. It wasn’t my way of intro- 
ducing you, dear reader, to an im- 
aginary world in which ghosts are 
real. In fact, there is not a bit of 
unfounded speculation in my story. 
Every bit of the science and 



63 



f 



technology is sound — as solid, I 
was tempted to write, as a holo- 
graphic projection. 

Len never got his degree, how- 
ever. First he got involved in a 
complicated generalization of the 
eight-fold way. As you probably 
know, Tom Ching eventually got 
the Nobel prize for generalizing the 
eight- fold way. What you probably 
don’t know is that Tom Ching and 
Len Bachutz worked together on the 
original mathematical formulation of 
the higher-dimensional equivalent of 
two-cubed. 

Then, without ever completing 
the part of the report he had prom- 
ised to write, Len suddenly went off 
on a completely wild tangent. He 
rediscovered some obscure medieval 
speculations from the Jewish Neo- 
Platonists that he felt constituted a 
detailed description of the big-bang 
beginning. From there he went to 
the Kabbala, an esoteric collection 
of obscure Jewish mystical writings 
that were, so he told me, the latest 
thing around the beginning of the 
thirteenth century. For some reason 
Len decided that they made a great 
deal more sense than anyone had 
thought for the last few centuries. 
He believed that all it needed was 
translating the medieval mummery 
into modem mathematics and, lo, 
we would have a free, unified field 
theory — without having to do the 
work of deriving and developing it! 

Of course no one around 
Princeton would even talk with 
him about that kind of madness. 

64 



The more Jewish the physicists he | 
tried to interest were, the less 
they wanted to be reminded that 
their ancestors had gotten into 
philosophical tangles as complicated 
as those that made Christian 
scholasticism the charming night- 
mare it is for the modem scholar. 
Maybe the Kabbalists didn’t worry 
about how many angels could dance 
on the head of a pin (actually, a 
perfectly sensible attack on the 
problem of degrees of infinity), but 
they had their own mind-bogglers. 
Len once told me that there had 
been a great deal of investigation of 
the ultimate shape of the universe. I 
think he said that it was probably 
that of a man and a woman embrac- 
ing. I remember he got annoyed 
when I asked him how close the 
embrace was (the Big Bang, as it 
were?) but I’m not sure whether the 
idea about the shape was his own or 
came from a medieval source. 

Anyhow, Len dropped out of 
Princeton and went to live in Boro 
Park, Brooklyn, where there is a 
sort of settlement of very traditional j 
Jews. There are streets there where 
everyone seems to be dressed up 
like members of an Amish commu- 
nity; the men in long black frocks; 
the women in heavy, shapeless, 
long dresses, with their hair hidden 
under wigs or bulky hats. Maybe 
I’m not getting the details of their 
dress exactly right but you get the 
picture. 

Len went to live there so he 
could study the old lore with the 

GALAXY 



masters who have made it their 
life’s work. I visited him a few 
times in the first year of his exile, 
but then we drifted apart. Each time 
I went to see him, he seemed to be 
deeper into that weird backwater 
society, and it was clear that he was 
increasingly hooked by the religion. 
Maybe he started off simply want- 
ing to learn about their theories 
about the nature of the universe, but 
after a year he was praying and 
beating his breast — or whatever they 
do — with the most devout of them. 

Nevertheless, he had kept up his 
membership in the American Physi- 
' cal Society, and once in an ul- 
tramarine moon he would send a 
brief, tightly reasoned note to 
I Physics Review Letters with an 
esoteric topic such as a Machian 
I approach to accounting for the spac- 
I ing of quantum shells in the nuc- 
leus, or an information theory in- 
terpretation of entropy as applied to 
! the distribution of charge in a 
hypothetical linear force field. 

I figured that by now, some sev- 
enteen years since he left 
Princeton, he must have the con- 
tacts I needed to try to implement 
my idea about the holographic Tem- 
ple. 

“Interesting,” he said, smiling 
slightly, after I had explained my- 
self We were sitting in his study. It 
was lined from floor to ceiling with 
heavy old books whose covers in- 
dicated they were in Hebrew or 
Yiddish or whatever it is that uses 
that crinkly alphabet. He lived these 

THE HOLY TEMPLE 



days in a fourth-floor apartment — 
no elevator — in a beat-up old frame 
building. From outside the heavy 
oak door of the study penetrated the 
pandemonium of a small apartment 
containing seven children who were 
forbidden to watch television (too 
much corrupting influence). His 
wife looked pretty healthy to me, 
but I had to wonder whether tran- 
quilizers are kosher. 

He thought a little and then 
opined in that smarmy voice he had 
cultivated since he got religion: “It 
says somewhere — I’ll have to try to 
track it down — that when the Tem- 
ple is rebuilt, its walls will be walls 
of fire. That’s encouraging. Of 
course you’re not the Messiah and 
He’s nowhere in sight so far as I 
know, and that’s not encouraging. 
Still, if you want to try, why not? It 
also is written that if the world is 
sufficiently evil, then the fulfillment 
of the prophecies will seem to be 
the action of purely natural forces, 
and that will be our punishment 
since we will not know the joy of 
witnessing His miracle. Maybe you 
are the natural instrument that will 
fulfill the prophecy.” He chuckled 
and continued in a voice more like 
a physicist and less like an appren- 
tice saint, “It seems to depend 
more on my mood than on anything 
that happens out there, but the 
world becomes, from time to time, 
quite evil. Other times it is rather 
good, all in all. We have a paradox. 

It was quite evil this morning, until 
you came here to visit me, old

friend. Now the world is getting bet- 
ter and better, in which case I’m 
afraid there’s not much hope for 
your idea. You had better go away 
and try to get belp from someone 
else. Then I’ll be able to help 
you.” 

I just sat there. I knew that I 
would have to survive two or three 
such logic mazes before the conver- 
sation turned serious. 

After a while Len said, ‘T know 
a man in the Knesset who should be 
able to help you. He has contacts in 
the Israeli government and the 
PLO.” 

“Hunh?!” 

“That’s right. The PLO has been 
smuggling refugees into Israel at 
a hundred dollars a head. The PLO 
gets some much-needed cash for 
which they don’t owe Russia, Saudi 
Arabia, Libya, or anybody any- 
thing. The Israelis are delighted be- 
cause they need manpower, and 
even if they have to pay the whole 
hundred dollars a head — and they 
rarely do — it is still a lot less than it 
costs them to get someone out of 
Russia. 

“It’s essential, of course, that the 
arrangements are not ruined by an 
unfortunate choice of a time and 
place to conduct a little practice raid 
or artillery duel. Therefore, some- 
one has to tell someone to tell 
someone to tell someone. My friend 
is second someone from the right. 
Of course, in Israeli politics that 
still puts him well to the left of our 
Democrats.” 

66 



“I don’t understand you.” 
“That’s okay. I’m just joking. 
But really, I do know the man you 
should contact. He does have con- 
tacts with both the Israeli govern- 
ment and the PLO.” 

“Len, you’re amazing.” 

“Call me ‘Aryeh,’ please.” 

★ * * 

And that’s how I came to be fly- 
ing to Israel, with a letter by Len in 
my pocket introducing me to Dr. 
Shimshon Kafsi, a physicist who 
used to work for some sort of secret 
Israeli project but was now a 
member of the Knesset, representing 
an obscure minority party whose 
principal platform plank appeared to 
be a crash program of government- 
sponsored experimental theology; 
how many prayers to Jeljovah can- 
cel how many prayers to Baal — that 
sort of thing, I think. Kafsi, in turn, 
was supposed to introduce me to 
someone else who would be able to 
introduce me to the right person in 
the Arab world. 

As I sat there in the late af- 
ternoon twilight forty-one thousand 
feet above the Bermuda triangle, 
my knees cramping me the way 
they always do when I have to sit 
still for a long time, I watched sev- 
eral young men dressed in the Or- 
thodox Jewish uniform sway and 
mumble in the aisle — saying their 
sunset prayers, I assumed. Lazily I 
fantasized a hijack attempt I would 
foil, earning the intense sexual fa- 

GALAXY 



vors of the cute little hostess. I took 
out my little pocket memo pad and 
made ready to note down any in- 
teresting invention ideas— my last- 
ditch fallback defense against utter 
ennui. 

I got stuff like: A way to make 
color television three-dimensional 
for under twenty-five dollars of re- 
trofitting per set, provided the view- 
er is totally red-green color blind; 
how to stabilize trojan orbits near 
binary black holes; a cheap way to 
prop up the Colossus of Rhodes, 
using technology available at the 
time it was standing. A typical 
series of invention ideas. Suddenly, 
however, I had an idea for a sort of 
digital -analog hybrid that would 
speed testing of possible proofs of 
Fermat’s Last Theorem. Now that 
was interesting! 

I began writing complicated equa- 
tions on my pad, using a combina- 
tion of Arabic, Greek, Roman and 
Hebrew orthography to permit me 
to distinguish all the different (and 
different kinds of) elements that had 
to be represented. The cute little 
hostess leaned over to see what I 
was writing, and I inhaled pure es- 
sence of rutting musk ox or sexually 
deviated sperm whale. It was all I 
could do to keep from doing all I 
could do. “What’s that?” the dear 
girl asked. 

“I can’t teU you,” I ruiswered. 
“It’s a military secret. I’m an 
American who works for the Israeli 
government — on loan, you know.” 

(I think I forgot to mention that the 

THE HOLY TEMPLE 



plane was an El Al 747—1 like their 
more thorough security searches.) 
“This is important mathematical 
work related to an important proj- 
ect. I imagine it’s safe to tell you 
this much because anyone who is 
crew on one of these flights must 
have been cleared before being 
given anti-hijack training, but I re- 
ally have to ask you to forget even 
this much. I tried to look very 
clever and competent. The inventor 
of a fountain-pen atomic bomb. 

Well, folks, that smart-ass reply 
of mine both saved my life and al- 
most led to World War HI. I’m glad 
about the first result of my dishon- 
est boasting, and I’m really, truly 
sorry about the second — except that 
I do have a trace of smug satisfac- 
tion that the Big War didn’t 
erupt— and maybe it became a little 
less likely that it ever will. 

I’m getting ahead of my stoiy 
though, so let’s get back to the next 
few minutes up there in that El Al 
jet. You’ve surely figured out by 
now that I was on the famous Flight 
400. Pay attention. I’m about to tell 
you what really happened. 

The cute little hostess blinked 
twice. Then she said, “Let me 
bring you some juice — or would 
you prefer some other beverage?” I 
noticed that for some reason her 
lower lip was trembling slightly. 

“Orange juice will be fine,” I 
answered. I had intended to add that 
a man with as important a mission 
as mine had to drink only healthful 
beverages, but before I could finish 



67 



my sentence, she took advantage of 
the pause before the start of a new 
clause and darted off down the aisle 
as if bringing me orange juice was 
the reason she had been given such 
cute little feet. 

However, once she disappeared 
into the 747’s galley, she never 
came back. Ten minutes dragged 
by. I drifted from the fantasy about 
how she would show me her admi- 
ration to the one about rescuing her 
from the escaped mental patient 
holding her in the galley with a 
bread knife. (Do they have bread 
knives in the galley? I doubt it — 
after all, the bread is pre-cut, isn’t 
it?) 

Suddenly a man’s voice spoke 
on the plane’s announcement sys- 
tem. “Ladies and gentlemen,” a 
very deep voice began, speaking 
with a distinctly foreign accent — 
later I discovered it was German. 
“This is Captain Ishmael speaking. 
I hope that you have been enjoying 
your trip and that the remainder of 
it will prove even more enjoyable 
and instructive. I must announce a 
slight change in itinerary, however. 
This plane was scheduled to pro- 
ceed directly to Tel Aviv. However, 
it will prove necessary to make a 
stopover in recently liberated Pales- 
tinian territory.” 

That was how we found out we 
had been hijacked. Captain Ishmael 
continued; “There will be several 
hours before we reach our destina- 
tion. During this time the normal 
services of this plane will continue. 

68 



However, no passenger will be 
permitted to leave his seat without 
first securing permission from the 
crew, one of whom may be sum- 
moned by pressing the call button. 
Any individual who disobeys this 
simple and reasonable regulation 
will be assumed to be plotting 
mutiny and will be dealt with by 
summary execution. Of course no 
sensible passenger is in the slightest 
danger because this one simple 
regulation, which we must enforce 
for the sake of order, is so easy to 
obey and so natural and obvious 
that there will be no need for con- 
cern by anyone not planning a 
mutiny. Please note that as of now, 
we, the Twentieth of June Chapter 
of the Mosque of Omar Division of 
the Free Palestinian People’s Army, 
are the duly constituted authority on 
this vessel in international flight, 
and any effort to seize control of 
this vessel from us is air piracy and 
subject to its well-known condign 
punishment. 

“Preparatory to our landing in 
Free Palestinian territory, there must 
be routine customs and visa inspec- 
tions and interviews. To obviate 
needless delay after we land, and so 
that you may promptly leave the 
plane if you wish to do so during 
our stopover in Free Palestine, we 
will interview each of you while we 
are in the air. When you hear your 
name announced, rise promptly 
from your seat and come down the 
aisle to the crew station next to the 
galley where the soft drinks are 



GALAXY 



stored. A crew member will meet 
you there and give you further in- 
structions. 

“To begin with, will Mr. Isaac 
Benson please come up for his 
i interview?” 

When Captain Ishmael mentioned 
I the Mosque of Omar, you can im- 
: agine how excited I became. I felt 
. like jumping up and cheering or 
I maybe kissing that cute little hostess 
I with the pheromone-charged per- 
fume (who was actually not in sight 
at the moment — maybe that’s what 
stopped me). Then, when I was 
called for first, my mood flip- 
flopped into total terror. Bravely I 
collapsed into a little heap of 
wriggling spineless invertebrates. 
Put simply, I fainted. 

When I came to, I was lying on 
, my back on the floor of what was 
obviously the galley. The cute little 
hostess was stretched on top of me 
squeezing and rubbing the back of 
my neck with her right hand while 
she massaged my right kneecap 
with her left hand. 

“Welcome back,” she whispered 
conspiratorially. Then, maternally 
(my mother is a nag): “Do you re- 
alize you’ve lost your turn! That 
was a really risky thing you did!” 

“Listen,” I whispered back, “I 
lied before. I’m not involved in any 
secret project for the U.S. govern- 
ment or the Israeli government or 
anyone. I’m just an inventor on my 
way on a business trip to try to sell 
my latest invention.” I tried to look 
as frightened, inadequate, stupid, 

THE HOLY TEMPLE 



blundering, bumbling and schnooky 
as I felt. 

Her eyes glistened. She put her 
arms up to. my shoulders and drew 
her lips to wi^n two-and-a-half air 
molecules of mine. Our lips were so 
close, the electrostatic forces made 
it seem as if they were touching. “I 
thought you would be this brave,” 
she whispered huskily in a voice 
that was the perfect sound equiva- 
lent of her perfume. It is a tribute to 
my youth and excellent health that I 
noticed this. It is a tribute to my 
terror that I didn’t care. 

“No, really,” I whispered back, 
“I’m really just a schnooky inven- 
tor!” I suddenly remembered to 
stop whispering and added in a 
shriek appropriate for either the 
situation I was in or a try-out for 
the role of the second of the Three 
Witches in Macbeth: “I’m not 

working for the Israeli government! 
I’m not working for the American 
government. I don’t know any mili- 
tary secrets!” 

“That was very resourceful,” she 
said thoughtfully and — ^if possible 
— ^more admiringly than ever. 
“Now the whole plane knows 
you’re an Israeli agent. We’ll have 
to be careful to treat you well until 
we get you away from the others. 
Then we’ll have to break your resis- 
tance quickly, to help counter the 
myth of Israeli invulnerability.” 

Even in my terror, which by now 
had reached the abject physiological 
level of imminent danger that I 
would wet my pants, I was struck 

69 



1 



by a major anomaly: “How come 
an Israeli stewardess is working for 
Arab hijackers?” I blurted. 

She answered in roughly the tone 
of voice the fifth-grade teacher’s pet 
used to use when she told her 
friends why she had ratted to the 
teacher about the firecracker under 
her desk: “I’m a deep double 
agent.” 

“Hunhm?” 

“Like every responsible govern- 
ment, the Israeli government plans 
for every contingency. Just in case 
the Arabs win, we have a certain 
number of agents planted in the 
Arab camp. Even if all other Jews 
in the world are exterminated, we 
handful of quislings will keep the 
Faith alive!” She smiled smugly. 

It occurred to me that there was 
no reason why she should be any 
more truthful with me than I had 
been with her. To my total as- 
tonishment, I heard my voice say, 
“I find you very attractive.” I then 
felt my face smile — engagingly, 1 
hoped. From the inside it felt quite 
forced. 

She whispered, “I find you very 
attractive, too. I think it is your 
bravery. I think that if you could 
find a rationalization for joining our 
camp, we would become lovers. 
Very good lovers. Very close lov- 
ers.” Her perfume sent little pru- 
rient organic pimps and panders 
scurrying up my nasal passages to 
infiltrate sneakily through the 
myriad holes in the bony plate be- 
tween the nasal sensors and my 

70 



brain. I listened to an intoxicated 
slice of brain think that it would be j 
worth it if I were killed for raping ' 
her. I firmly (not too firmly, I 
hoped) told myself to stop that kind ! 
of stuff. I 

Sternly, I told myself that all 1 
would do would be to put my arm 
around the girl. That was just I 
friendly, that’s all. But when I did ' 
it, the way her magnetic poles 
brushed against me gave me an 
idea. I kissed her. That seemed to 
increase the magnetic field and gave 
me another idea. 

★ ★ ★ 

The dark gent in the burnoose 
didn’t really try to keep the rifle 
pointed at me. “People are always 
more suggestible right after or- 
gasm,” he said with a smile, sound- 
ing sneaky because of the way he 
hissed his esses. 

“Whom are you trying to 
suggest?” I asked, “Me or her?” 

He laughed soundlessly. He was 
a short, dark man who appeared to 
be about twenty pounds underweight. 
He had the kind of face that is best i 
described as foxlike to anyone who 
is familiar with what foxes are like. 
Since I’m not such a one, I would 
get the picture of his face better — 
if, that is, someone else had to de- 
scribe it to me— -if it were described 
as crafty looking, triangular, with a . 
tiny mouth over a little sunken chin. 
He looked like one of the bad guys 
in a movie that doesn’t have time 

GAIAXY 



for characterization and has to rely 
on stereotypes to identify who’s on 
which side. I have always hated 
such movies and such stereotypies. 
Besides, I was in a good mood. I 
decided to like him. 

“I’m not any kind of agent. I’m 
a dumb inventor. I’m on my way to 
Israel to try to sell an invention. I’ll 
tell you all about it. It has abso- 
lutely no practical value what- 
soever. I’ve simply invented a way 
to make giant three-dimensional 
projections — images — of things. I 
could make a three-dimensional 
image of a house and it would look 
absolutely real. You could walk 
around it and see it from all sides. 
But it would not shelter you from 
the rain. It would just be an image. 

“My idea is to use my invention 
to project an image of a recon- 
structed Temple in Jerusalem. My 
kind of three-dimensional image can 
be turned on or off by a flick of a 
switch. I expect each of the differ- 
ent religious groups in Jerusalem 
will want their own image to fit 
their own beliefs about what the 
Temple was or should be like. The 
Moslems could have their own 
image or images too, you know.” 

“How do you keep such a large 
wave front collimated?” he asked. 

“You can’t do it without feed- 
back,” I answered. “You need sen- 
sors located out at various distances 
along the line of the wave front’s 
progress. The light input is con- 
verted to electrons that move down 
a path through a flawless metal 

THE HOLY TEMPLE 



crystal. In effect, the light signal 
triggers a signal several orders of 
magnitude higher in frequency and 
therefore capable of measuring the 
time of arrival of the light with very 
great accuracy. The electrons trigger 
a moving wave of surface charge 
shift along a long, thin metal fila- 
ment. It’s something like a neural 
impulse. The surface waves from 
each of the different sensors that are 
supposed to receive simultaneous 
signals converge on a single junc- 
tion that is similar to a neural 
synapse at which several neural 
axons converge. If the timing of the 
different signals is even slightly off, 
they fail to synergize to produce a 
sufficiently strong momentary po- 
tential surge to trigger a response in 
a condensor plate that constitutes 
the equivalent of the next neuron in 
the network. In effect, the system 
acts to magnify tiny errors in simul- 
taneity, that is, collimation. Then a 
feedback circuit adjusts the collima- 
tion by focusing a standing ul- 
trasound wave on a transparent 
helium medium through which the 
light passes as it leaves the laser 
source. The variations in density 
produced by modifying the focus of 
the ultrasound act to adjust the 
speed of the light wavefront by just 
the proper amount.” 

“But how do you take into ac- 
count noise in the transmission of 
the error signal, or in the system 
that generates the correction?” 

I didn’t think to wonder how 
come he knew enough physics to 

71 



ask the right questions or how 
come he was catching on so fast. I 
tend to think that everyone knows 
everything. That’s one of the 
reasons my inferiority complex is 
such a splendid specimen. I am re- 
ally very proud of it. 

“The feedback makes the proper 
conection,” I answered, “except 
for certain dangerous resonant fire- 
quencies. The system is so sensitive 
and so fast that its resonant fre- 
quencies are up in the soft X-ray 
range, much higher than light fre- 
quency, and so a light signal is 
hardly ever appreciably damaged.” 

“How fast does that surface 
charge effect travel? It can’t be very 
fast. Doesn’t that make the whole 
system very insensitiveT' 

Just then I was suddenly re- 
minded that Shaya (the cute hostess) 
was still lying next to me — rather, 
behind me, with her body pressed 
against my bare back. She reminded 
_me. She did it by suddenly biting 
my shoulder, I gave a little yelp and 
squirmed away from her, banging 
my head against the metal side of 
the galley soiled-dish receptacle. 

While I was massaging my head 
and my shoulder and wishing the 
cute little hostess would do it, the 
dark bumoosed one with the rifle 
spoke a short, angry-sounding 
phrase in a guttural language, and 
the c.l.h. scooted out of there to- 
ward the front of the plane, not 
even stopping to slip into her shoes. 

“I am glad you have decided to 
cooperate,” the d.b.o. said. “It 

72 



would have been a great propaganda 
coup for the Israelis if they had 
been the ones to spring the surprise 
appearance of the new Temple. 
Now we will provide the sur- 
prise.” 

“Why can’t everybody do their 
own thing?” 

“No doubt, eventually, all sur- 
viving actors in the little drama will 
get the chance to display a suitable 
Temple, but there is no need that all 
do so equally promptly. It will be 
far better for the future peace and 
stability of the world, let alone this 
region, if we put on our show 
first.” He smiled. He had too many 
teeth. I decided that maybe I should 
stop liking him. On second thought, 
I decided to try as hard as I could 
to like him, at least as long as he 
had a rifle and I didn’t. In fact, 
even if we both had rifles. 

He smiled even more broadly, 
showing some, shiny steel where his 
molars grew like a coral reef. “We 
wondered if you would reveal your- 
self. You are a very sensible, very 
wise, very adaptable man. Perhaps 
you would like to use the next few 
hours before landing preparing a list 
of the supplies you will need. We 
may have to order some and we 
are in such a hurry that even hours 
may count. You have never had the 
luxury of the kind of support staff 
we will provide you. If you give me 
your list. I will radio ahead and we 
will be ready when we land.” 

I realized that somehow I had 
been expected. It must have been 

GALAXY 





some message from Aryeh 
(Leonard) that had gone astray. It 
seemed to me that I would be be- 
traying my good Jewish friend if I 
cooperated with these Arabs but I 
felt that it would be better to betray 
him than to betray myself by getting 
myself killed. I would try to make 
it up later, maybe by contributing to 
the Jewish National Fund. 

I gave him a list of equipment 
and supplies. 1 made it as long and 
expensive as possible. If in doubt, I 
asked for the more expensive and 
complicated component rather than 
some simpler, cheaper alternative. 
He seemed delighted with the list 
and his glee seemed to grow with 
the growing cost. “Now I am sure 
your device will work,” he said. 
“Nobody would have built some- 
thing remotely like it if he did not 
know precisely what he was looking 
for.” 

“Nobody ever has. I haven’t. 
Did you think I had?” 

“Oh, no!” he reassured me. 
“But I did worry about why some- 
thing like your idea hadn’t been 
tried before. I think that equipment 
will run close to half a million dol- 
lars. That’s very encouraging.” 

I tried to think of some big ex- 
travagance to encourage him enough 
to put down the rifle but I seemed 
to have run out of inspiration — 
until: “And I’ll also need five assist- 
ants. all of whom have or almost 
have doctorates in appropriate areas 
of physics and engineering.” 

“Physics and . .?” 

74 



“I meant ‘or.’ ” 

“If ‘and’ would be better. I’m 
sure it can be arranged.” 

For the first time I grasped the 
implications of the increase in the 
price of oil. 

Three weeks later I began to 
grasp the implications of the impli- 
cations. We had landed at an 
airstrip next to an oasis in the mid- 
dle of a desert. For all I knew, 
there was a town just beyond the 
second sand dune from the right, 
but there was no sign it was there. 
Nevertheless, by helicopter and by 
giant transport plane, people and 
equipment came pouring into Angry 
Shah, the name I had privately 
given to wherever we were. After 
about a week the other passengers 
and the crew had flown off. I never 
did get close to Shay a again. I 
wasn’t exactly an honored guest, or 
the boss of the project, or a pris- 
oner. I was all three, plus a lot of 
other stuff I couldn’t readily label. 
My hosts were spending money as 
though it were about to go out of 
style. (With the great inflation of 
the eighties going full blast, I guess 
they may have been right.) 

Tlie upshot was that that morn- 
ing, three weeks later, I was stand- 
ing next to the portable blackboard 
in the command tent. Seated around 
the teak conference table were four 
of the world’s top ten experts on the 
engineering or physics of holog- 
raphy. I strongly suspected the miss- 
ing six were Jewish. 

“Gentlemen,” I said (thinking 

GALAXY 



that “Whores” would have been a 
more accurate collective charac- 
terization and probably “Fellow 
whores” would have been better 
yet), “then we are agreed that we’ll 
have the first megaholograph ready 
for demonstration in fifteen days.” 

Dr. Takashita, a quiet little man 
with graying hair and a pencil-thin 
moustache, said, “Calibration.” 
That was about forty per cent of his 
daily syllable ration so I avoided 
asking him to explain. I had learned 
to think about whatever he said be- 
fore I asked him to say anything 
more, which was, I suppose, the 
main reason for his communication 
style. 

“I assume that the calibration 
will be complete by the end of the 
week. Today is Monday. That 
means Friday.” 

I looked around the table, 
searching for disagreement, hoping 
for agreement. As usual, they 
looked alert and intelligent but 
avoided giving me much of a clue. 

I took the desperate step again: I 
thought. 

“Let’s see, if we have to get the 
calibration done, we first have to get 
all the equipment solidly anchored. 
That means we have to calibrate the 
vibration and shock-measuring 
equipment. That means we have to 
anchor it. Well, we have today’s as- 
signment defined for us.” 

For once things went without 
serious hitches. By Friday we did 
have everything calibrated. We had 
decided to use, for our first image, 

THE HOLY TEMPLE 



something that could be briefly mis- 
taken for a real object but that could 
not possibly fool an observer for 
any length of time. Therefore, we 
would project a grove of palm trees 
that grew near the well near the 
center of the oasis. At first glance 
it should look real but it would be- 
tray itself when the trees did not 
move with the breeze. (I know. 
What about dead calm? We decided 
not to try the experiment in a dead 
calm.) 

★ ★ ★ 

Saturday was spent setting up our 
laser equipment all around the palm- 
tree grove. Sunday we spent getting 
hijacked. 

The attack started just before 
dawn, I am told. I was, of course, 
in the sack. The first I knew, there 
was the sound of machine-gun fir- 
ing from somewhere outside my 
land cruiser. I sleepily assumed that 
some of the Arab guards had gotten 
drunk or high and were whooping it 
up. Since the only women at our 
camp were some elderly cooks and 
Senora Lupe Arrau-McBride, our 
sixty-eight-year-old Chilean expert 
on wave-front polarization diffrac- 
tion, I had been expecting some sort 
of hell to break loose. 

It must have been no more than 
two minutes later, however, that 
three armed men burst into my 
room. They were dressed like Rus- 
sian air-force officers (at the time 
all I dimly gathered was that they 



75 



looked like some sort of Russian 
military officers — red stars, you 
know, do kind of suggest that). 
They all carried smoking machine 
guns. The first man in, who looked 
in the dim light to be about twelve, 
said in unaccented English, “Get 
up, you ass-kissing quisling Arab- 
loving fairy, or we’ll blow your 
brains out faster than your Arab 
friends could blow anything else.” 
Notice the absence of any exclama- 
tion mark at the end of that sen- 
tence. He said it quietly, easily, as 
if he usually said sweet things like 
that when, as he did several times a 
day, he burst into a man’s room 
carrying a smoking gun. 

My reaction was to swallow a big 
gulp of spit and phlegm and start to 
choke. I doubled up, all tangled in 
the sheets, parts of my naked 
anatomy sticking out obscenely 
while other parts convulsively wove 
the sheets into a straitjacket 
woven around and between my 
arms and chest and back. I coughed 
and strangled and my heart palpi- 
tated with a mixture of terror that 
any moment they would shoot me 
in the precious parts of me that 
were exposed and terror that they 
would simply stand there and watch 
while I choked to death. It seemed 
like a singularly embarrassing way 
to die. 

Suddenly I felt hands grabbing 
me under the knee joints. I was 
jerked out of bed and out of the bed 
sheets with such force that a sheet 
flapped against my chin with a loud 

76 



snap, damn near knocking me out. I 
never had time to hit the floor with 
my head because two other arms 
grabbed me under the arm pits and 
I was swung face down across the 
back of one of my friendly visitors. 

You won’t believe this. I was 
still coughing and choking. Guess 
what I thought; I was so confused 
and crazy that my only thought was 
that it was a lucky thing I was 
naked so they could see definite 
proof that I didn’t find riding like 
that on a man’s back exciting. I lay 
there, half choked, and felt pleased 
that they would soon surely decide 
they had maligned me by calling me 
a queer! 

We started out of the tent. I 
could still hear plenty of shots being 
fired in the background, also quite a 
bit of screaming and moaning. 
There was a lot of flickering light; 
evidently a good deal of the camp 
was burning. I smelled a terrible 
roasting smell that would have been 
delicious if it had not seemed likely 
that it was coming from what I was 
afraid it was coming from. 

Suddenly there was a burst of 
light, then everything went black. 

They told me later that my 
coughing was driving them nuts, 
and besides, it seemed likely to draw 
fire from somebody. They half sus- 
pected I was doing it on purpose — a 
very clever trick, they thought — and 
so they gently conked me on the 
head with a machine gun. 

Once again I suffered from over- 
estimation. 



GALAXY 



It is a miracle I didn’t die of 
choking while I was unconscious, 
but perhaps the way they were car- 
rying me with my head lower than 
my chest saved my life by promot- 
ing drainage. 

I awoke in a hospital room. Now 
remember, the men I had seen were 
wearing Russian-type uniforms. Na- 
turally I assumed I was in Russia. 
When I opened my eyes, there were 
two nurses and a doctor — or so I per- 
ceived the situation; later I learned 
otherwise. But when I first saw the 
three white-suited persons next to 
my bed, it was a natural assumption. 

In English that had the faintest 
trace of an accent, the doctor said, 
“You were not seriously injured, 
Mr. Benson. You are in a hospital 
only as a precaution. After we per- 
form a few simple tests to make 
sure we haven’t overlooked any- 
thing, I plan to release you. That 
will probably be in a few hours.” 
He smiled. “It is a pleasure to meet 
you, Mr. Benson,” he went on. 
“Let me introduce myself. I am 
Doctor Sapir. This is your nurse. 
Miss Kessef. The other lovely lady 
is a medical security officer, Lef- 
tenant Dagell.” Note that he pro- 
nounced the military title the British 
way, with a “left.” 

The names didn’t tell me much. 
They didn’t sound particularly Rus- 
sian but this was a very small sam- 
ple. The doctor was slight, aging, 
rather dark-skinned, with black eyes 
and hair. His face was wrinkled, his 
cheeks sunken, his facial bones 



prominent. The women were both 
twenty-ish, smiling, wearing no 
lipstick, black-haired, dark-eyed, at- 
tractive, slender. One was olive- 
skinned, the other very light. 

I took a direct approach. “Where 
am I?” 

“In a military hospital not far 
from Tel Aviv.” 

The Russians weren’t going to 
fool me that easily. I had been one 
of the few loyal fans of the televi- 
sion series, “The Prisoner,” in 
which a determined man escaped 
again and again from a diabolically 
complex trap, only to be caught be- 
fore the end of the program so that 
the next show could give him 
another opportunity to escape. Be- 
sides, I am as paranoid as anyone 
you might care to compare to me. 

“How soon can I see an Ameri- 
can Embassy official?” I asked 
slyly. 

Leftenant Dagell answered, “The 
embassy will be notified im- 
mediately if you wish, and they will 
probably send someone over right 
away. But can’t we persuade you to 
wait?” She smiled sweetly. 

I knew that, of course, there 
would be a well -trained agent who 
would impersonate an American 
consular official. It seemed to me 
that my best strategy would be to 
appear to be fooled. At all costs I 
wanted to avoid the brain-washing 
drugs and torture that would be my 
fate if my captors knew I saw 
through their clever masquerade. 

“Why should I want to wait?” I 

77 



THE HOLY TEMPLE 



asked, trying to sound dumb and 
innocent, and hoping I would do a 
better job of it than I had done ear- 
lier when my Arab friends had 
hijacked the El A1 747. 

“We need your help with the 
giant holographic projector we are 
building,” Lt. Dagell explained. 
Her voice and manner were 
military — crisp. She made me feel 
as if I had been late returning a li- 
brary book. She didn’t sound as if 
she needed anyone’s help with any^ 
thing. 

“How far along are you?” I 
asked, cleverly probing for informa- 
tion. 

“We have duplicated what the 
Arabs did for you at Wadi Qatar.” 
Her pronunciation of the gutteral 
“q” was splendid. I felt sure that 
the leftenant always had a perfectly 
clear throat; she could probably flip 
a speck on her soft palate twenty 
feet against a stiff breeze. 

By the way, she was the light- 
skinned one. Her hair was straight, 
short, severe. So were her eye- 
brows. 1 never saw a woman 
without horn-rimmed glasses who 
gave so powerful an impression that 
she was wearing them. 

“I’m surprised you want help 
from a ‘quisling Arab-loving fairy,’ ” 

I said, sounding sincerely hurt; I still 
resented the unjust accusation. 

To my surprise all three burst 
into laughter. “Our psychologists 
triumph again!” Dr. Sapir said, ob- 
viously forcing himself to keep 
from guffawing some more. “They 



assured us that if our men recited 
that accusation when they came to 
get you, you would become too 
upset to resist — just in case you 
wanted to. 

“Please accept our apologies,” 
he went on. “We have no reason to 
believe you had that sort of intimate 
relationship with your Arab captors. 
By the way, did you?” 

Later I learned that this was Dr. 
Sapir’s way of being funny but at 
the time I was not amused. How- 
ever, since I wasn’t Queen Victoria, 
and since I didn’t want to come 
across like any sort of queen any- 
way, I decided to be polite and 
calm despite the insult. Besides, 
remember, I assumed that my three 
firiends were not above little expres- 
sions of affection — like an Iron 
Maiden. 

“I cooperated with my captors 
because I’m apolitical,” I an- 
swered. This time I didn’t try to 
sound stupid. It was hard enough 
trying not to sound priggish. “My one 
aim in life is to see my invention of 
macro-holographies demonstrated. 
I’ll be glad to help you build the 
necessary projector. However,” I 
went on, “it would certainly make 
me feel more like the guest of a 
civilized nation rather than the pris- 
oner of a gang of bandits if I could 
see an American consular official 
and if I could come and go as I 
please. I certainly have no reason to 
run off, at least not until the 
macro-holograph projector is com- 
pleted.”

“We’ll drive you into town to the 
American Embassy this afternoon, 
provided the doctors here check you 
out,” Lt. Dagell crisply assured 
me. “If you can’t leave the hospi- 
tal, we’ll arrange for someone from 
the embassy to come here.” 

“I think you’ll be able to leave in 
an hour or two,” Dr. Sapir said 
breezily. “Our mutal friend. Rabbi 
Bachutz, tells us you are virtually 
indestructible.” 

“How would he know?” I was 
impressed with the effectiveness of 
Soviet intelligence. 

“He says that not only are you 
smart and creative, you’re dso 
lucky.” 

That sounded like Leonard! 
Could it be that he was actually a 
deep-cover Soviet agent? Could his 
sudden conversion to Jewish or- 
thodoxy have been the result of or- 
ders from his Soviet spy contact? 

Suddenly I had a brilliant idea. 
“In what city is the embassy?” I 
asked. 

“In Tel Aviv, I’m sorry to say,” 
the crisp leftenant replied, sounding 
not so crisp for the first time. 
“Your government has been unwill- 
ing to place the embassy where it 
belongs, in our capital city, 
Jerusalem.” She shook her head 
sadly. 

“I’ve always wanted to see the 
famous sights of Israel. Could we 
arrange a sightseeing tour? To the 
Wailing Wall, for example?” 

“The Western Wall,” Dr. Sapir 
corrected, sounding pleased. “Now 



that it is no longer on foreign terri- 
tory, we don’t call it the ‘Wailing 
Wall’ any longer.” 

“Bring me all the information 
you can get on the macro- 
holographic projector you’ve been 
building. I’ll study it until we’re 
ready to go on our little tour. I’d 
like that to be our schedule for the 
next few days: work part of the 
day, tourism the rest.” 

I figured it would be fun to watch 
them manufacture excuses for not 
being able to take me to all the 
sightseeing attractions in Israel. 

That afternoon, though, I was 
very impressed by the amount of 
money and effort, not to mention 
detailed preparation, the Russians 
had put into the attempt to fool me. 
As we drove in what seemed like a 
perfectly ordinary automobile — 
although a small one by American 
standards — I could detect no flaws 
in the splendidly worked out, utterly 
convincing illusion they had gener- 
ated that this place was really in Is- 
rael. They even, incredibly, had 
mock-ups of the various famous 
buildings I specified! It became in- 
creasingly difficult to believe that 
all this elaborate and expensive prep- 
aration had been done just to fool 
me. Instead, I began more and more 
to fear that they had tampered with 
my brain — with my memories — 
while I had been unconscious. That 
would explain why I had been 
knocked out; it would also explain 
the presence of a physician when I 
awoke. 



THE HOLY TEMPLE

I found it frightening to consider 
that things I was sure I knew, such 
as that Israel had a famous museum 
dedicated to the holocaust, might 
actually have been implanted by the 
Russians for some ulterior purpose. 
After all, my memories were the 
stuff that made me me. How could 
I be sure that I was still the same 
person I had been before my abduc- 
tion? How could I be sure about 
any of my memories? Maybe there 
had never been an abduction. 
Maybe I was a robot built by my 
captors for the specific purpose of 
overseeing the construction of a 
giant holographic projector, and 
maybe all my memories were 
phony. Maybe there was no United 
States, no Leonard Bachutz, no 
Isaac Benson. 

I thought this stuff while I was 
riding around in the little white 
Fiat, sitting in the back seat next to 
Lt. Dagell, with a glum-faced young 
non-com driving. He didn’t seem to 
speak any English; Dagell communi- 
cated with him in quick barks of a 
guttural language I assumed was a 
local dialect of Hebrew, though it 
sounded more like Arabic to me. 
While I was scaring myself with 
thoughts that I might really be a fic- 
tional character, I tried to hide my 
disturbance behind conventionaJ 
oohing and ahing at appropriate 
places along the tour. But Dagell 
noticed something was amiss. I 
guess I oohed when I should have 
ahed. 

“Are you unwell?” she asked. 



peering into my eyes like an 
ophthalmology intern about to be 
thrilled by his first microwave- 
induced cataract. 

“I’m fine,” I gulped, but she 
didn’t believe me. 

She barked something more gut- 
mral than usual and the Fiat 
U-tumed in heavy traffic, eliciting a 
splendid fanfare of car horns fol- 
lowed by a capella guttural cries. 

My hands and feet had begun to 
tingle. Now the tingling seemed to 
spread all over my body. At the 
same time, my heart suddenly 
began to flutter and a reddish haze 
spread in front of my eyes. Consid- 
ering how the Fiat was weaving 
through cars and pedestrians, that 
haze probably protected me from 
being scared to death. 

The next thing I knew, I was 
lying in a hospital bed again, feel- 
ing very warm and drowzy. I hadn’t 
felt so peaceful and contented since 
I was weaned — which is odd, since 
I was a bottle baby. 

Dr. Sapir smiled down at me. 
“We’ll have proof shortly that 
you’re really in Israel,” he said. I 
smiled up at him. He was really a 
very sweet man. It was a shame he 
wasn’t real. But the fact that all this 
was an illusion was somehow very 
charming, very cute. I felt that this 
was the most pleasant little night- 
mare a man could possibly have, 
and I really felt grateful to him or 
to whomever was responsible. 

“You told us all about it under 
narcosynthesis,” he said pleasantly. 



80 



GALAXY 






and I couldn’t help but be grateful 
1 that they had taken all that trouble 
. over me. 

I The next couple of days were a 
, twilight haze. They kept me happily 

drugged, just barely awake enough 
to take care of eating, drinking, 
^ eliminating, and answering silly lit- 
tle questions about that funny, 
fiinny notion — the giant holographic 
) projector. 

I think it was on the third day that 
they let the drags wear off. I woke 
to find Dr. Sapir and Leftenant 
Dagell next to my bed again. 
Frosty-face Dagell actually smiled! 
\ “We have some visitors for you,” 
I she said. In walked my mother, Len 
Bachutz (dressed in his Orthodox 
1 Jew uniform), and a gray-suited, 

■ gray-haired pudgy gentleman I 
' knew instantly must be the Ameri- 
can Embassy official detailed to as- 
' sure me this was really Israel! 

There was a peculiar scurrying 
around inside my head. It lasted 
less than a second but it felt like a 
century of fierce, uninterrupted 
mental work. I had to rearrange all 
i my perceptions. My final resting 
point was the conviction that it 
didn’t matter whether or not I was in 
Israel — or Russia — or a nut factory 
in Norristown, Pennsylvania. The 
question was really metaphysical. 
The situation was such a convincing 
mock-up of being in Israel that I 
? might as well act as if I were in Is- 
j rael. After all, I really might be, 
after all. 

A moment later I was delighted I 
THE HOLY TEMPLE 



had made that decision. In walked a 
fourth visitor. My, the hospital 
seemed kind of lax about how many 
visitors they let into a patient’s 
room at the same time. Through the 
door undulated Shaya, the cute little 
hostess! This time she was wearing 
what looked to be a regulation Is- 
raeli captain’s uniform. 

It took a while for the several dif- 
ferent conversations that ensued to 
get themselves sorted out but in 
time it was settled that my mother 
and Aryeh (Len) would be visiting 
with me for about ten days, with all 
of us sharing an apartment in a 
spanking new apartment house on 
the outskirts of Natanya. Shaya was 
introduced all around as my new as- 
sistant on the holography project. 

My mother took an instant shine 
to her which she expressed by 
drawing from her pocketbook one 
of the little copies of the New Tes- 
tament she always carries about. 
She thrust the Book at Shaya, ex- 
plaining that it was a gateway to 
surpassing peace. I began to under- 
stand why Shaya was a successful 
double (at least) agent when she 
very gratefully accepted the volume 
and began leafing through it, sud- 
denly absolutely absorbed and fas- 
cinated. 

The next morning, at our new 
apartment, my mother woke me at 
six-thirty. For a sleepy thirty sec- 
onds I thought I was late to high 
school. Mother wanted me to start 
my first day of work right. She had 
prepared a breakfast that would 

81 






have prepared me for work as a 
Siberian Husky. 

There was a Jeep waiting 
downstairs for me when I emerged, 
burping, at seven-forty. Lt. Dagell 
(does she ever sleep?) was there to 
finger me to the driver. The Is- 
raelis, it turned out, were going di- 
rectly for the big pay-off. Our 
headquarters were in a secret post 
behind and underneath a Druse- 
owned barbershop quite near the 
Mosque of Omar. You go in a little 
door at the rear of the barbershop, 
go down a flight of stairs, walk 
through a dusty basement full of 
crates of, I suppose, hair tonic, 
walk through a door labeled in He- 
brew, Arabic and Turkish (I found 
this all out later), “Plumbing 
obstructed. Please use facilities up- 
stairs.” You are in a filthy room 
that smells like a latrine long over- 
due for cleaning. You step into the 
rickety toilet seat and press hard 
against the top of the dirty mirror 
next to it. Suddenly the room fills 
with an intense white light. The seat 
falls away but before you have time 
to fall, the mirror against which you 
are pressing tilts outward against 
your pressure. With it comes the en- 
tire wall, which suddenly is beneath 
you rather than in front. Before you 
have time to adjust to the fact that 
the entire roomlet has become a 
vehicle rushing through some un- 
derground passageway, before you 
have time to turn around and see 
where the harsh light is coming 
from, the ride is over. The wall be- 



neath you tilts again and you tumble 
head forward onto a padded surface 
like a large gym mat. Standing all 
about you in a large room without 
visible doors or windows are 
fierce-looking Israeli soldiers hold- 
ing burp guns pointing at the place 
your burps come from. 

I never got used to that way of 
arriving at work. What would they 
do if one of the people who had to 
work there had a weak heart or, 
worse yet, had a back that was eas- 
ily thrown out? 

Except for the padded reception 
area, the rest of the room, which 
was about the size of a high-school 
gymnasium, was filled with equip- 
ment stolen from the set of a mad- 
scientist movie. Amazingly, though, 
it worked: With a very few additions 
and improvements, it was going to 
be able to project giant holographic 
images. 

I suppxise you’re hot to find out 
how I left that fancy place. Well, I 
don’t know. When it was time to 
go, they would very politely ask me 
to take a deep breath of an anesthe- 
tic gas. Next thing I’d know, I was 
sitting in a barber’s chair upstairs. 
Don’t ask me how they kept the 
neighbors from wondering about the 
strange-looking guy who would get 
carried into the barbershop every 
afternoon. Come to think of it, I 
don’t even know, of course, that 
they did have to carry me. Maybe 
that anesthesia was really some sort 
of memory blackout. Maybe I 
walked in like a zombi, under my 



82 



GALAXY 



own steam, but with the clutch in, 
fully disengaging my brain. 

Shaya was around a lot. She even 
came over to my apartment one 
evening, whereupon my mother 
suddenly got wanderlust. She an- 
nounced she was going out to look 
for a taxi. “Where are you going, 
Ma?” I asked. It was Friday eve- 
ning, a time when even the streets 
and sidewalks rest. That Friday 
night, I didn’t. You would think 
that a good Seventh Day Adventist 
of my mother’s generation would 
not have been that cooperative. 

★ ★ ★ 

After my mother and Len left for 
the USA, Shaya surpri.sed me: She 
accepted my offer and moved in. 
After that, life sped by blissfully. 
Finally the great day arrived. We 
would turn on The Temple on Ha- 
nukkah, the anniversary of the dedi- 
cation of the Temple. Okay, so I 
wasn’t thinking very clearly or I 
would have remembered how my 
Arab friends felt about the idea of 
the Israelis turning on the Temple. 
(They felt about it about how the 
police chief of Memphis would 
have felt about somebody turning 
on the President.) No, Aat’s not 
quite right. I did remember and ac- 
tually I was very scared. But it was 
an odd sort of fear. It didn’t affect 
my work. Somehow it stayed 
locked up in a comer of my mind, 
walled off from the day’s work. 

I was terrified every night: I had 



nightmares in which Arabs with 
giant scimitars cut off my toes for 
practice before going on to cutting 
off my practice; I had cramps after 
every meal; I had spots in front of 
the spots in front of my eyes. 

But somehow I had succeeded in 
mcking my awareness into a little 
pocket in my head whenever it was 
time to work on the project. I took 
out my fear and stroked it and fon- 
dled it every evening, but come 
morning I was able to put it away 
again. I guess I assumed that some- 
how, some way, those clever, com- 
petent, efficient Israelis would be 
able to handle whatever the Arabs 
tried to do to stop us or punish us. 
After all, those Israelis were so 
cool, so determined, so scientific. 

We planned to turn the Temple 
on just before sunset, just before the 
time for lighting the first Hanukkah 
candle. There had been no official 
advance announcement of what we 
planned to do, just a vague news 
item that the Israelis had a surpris- 
ing new scientific achievement to 
make public, one that had no possi- 
ble military application but might 
nevertheless contribute greatly to 
the security of the Jewish state. 

It was mad, of course, for the Is- 
raelis to have thought their Arab 
enemies would not know or at least 
guess what was up. First of all, the 
Arabs had been directly involved 
when I worked for them out in 
Angry Shah. Second of all, there 
was the little matter of the date. 
Hanukkah, Shaya told me, is the

first priority to private, personal 
matters. “Can Shaya be saved?” I 
asked, talking so fast I must have 
sounded as if I were babbling. 
“Can Shaya be brought here before 
the bombs start to fall? Do you 
know where she is? She’s out there, 
isn’t she? Can we get a message to 
her?” I think I got all that out in 
one breath. Most of it should have 
been printed as one word, without 
any spaces. 

Dr. Sapir suddenly grabbed me 
by both shoulders and forced me to 
sit down in an empty space in the 
front bench. “Shaya can’t come,” 
he said, looking very stem. His grip 
on my shoulders became so tight I 
ached. “There was an Arab suicide 
raid on your apartment this morning 
just after you left. They evidently 
thought you were still at home. 
They were ready to do anything to 
stop our use of your invention. 
Luckily for you, you had left al- 
ready. But they got everyone still in 
the apartment.” 

I didn’t get the main implication. 
Was he trying to tell me that Shaya 
had been two-timing me? Who else 
could have been in the apartment 
except for Shaya? I asked him; 
“Who else could have been in the 
apartment except for Shaya?” 

“We had two security agents 
conferring with her about special 
precautions but there were about ten 
raiders and they had the advantage 
of surprise. Four of them actually 
got away and we are hunting for 
them still.” 



The room shimmered about me. 
He pulled my head forward against 
him. Suddenly I felt someone be- 
hind me pressing a hypo into my 
shoulder muscle, right through the 
shirt. “The best thing you can do 
now,” he said, “is to help us 
against them. It’s what she would 
want you to do. She had great faith 
in you. From the start she spoke in 
your behalf and was your chief de- 
fender. There were some who 
thought you might be a clever agent 
and so your freedom if not your life 
was by no means certain, at least at 
first.” 

“You lost the war and she got 
killed anyway?” I whispered, my 
throat oddly constricted. I was hav- 
ing great difficulty breathing. 

“No!” he shouted. “We haven’t 
lost the war! It begins to look as if 
we’ve won it!” 

That, of course, was hysteria. It 
occurred to me that if he was so 
confused that he thought his side 
might have won the war, then he 
probably was much too confused to 
have any trustworthy information 
about Shaya. I felt much better. He 
probably had her confused with six 
other women. Maybe, poor man, 
something like what he had de- 
scribed to me had actually happened 
to him and a girl he had been living 
with many years ago. 

“I’m sure everything will be all 
right,” I said as soothingly as I 
could. I began to feel very sleepy. 

Suddenly the screen changed. I 
recognized the face that appeared on 



92 



GALAXY 



it. It was the Prime Minister of 
Egypt. For the first time the sound 
came on and I heard him. He was 
obviously delivering some sort of 
solemn speech. Probably, I thought, 
he was assuring the Israelis they 
would be treated well if they sur- 
rendered immediately. 

To my astonishment, the roomful 
of mostly stiff, military men dis- 
solved into wild cheers. Men hug- 
ged their neighbors and, pounding 
each other on the back, danced 
around the room. Did the Arabs 
have some kind of nerve gas? Why 
wasn’t I affected? 

“Your holographic projector 
made the difference,” Dr. -General 
Sapir shouted over the din. 

I stared at him. 

“It fooled you, too,” he chor- 
tled. “The planes, Isaac, and the 
tanks, were mostly just images.” 

“How did you make them 
move?” 

“One plane or one tank projected 
a group that moved with it. The 
Arabs had guilty consciences, a 
fatal weakness. They knew that they 
had sneaked in extra arms that the 
great powers, except for Russia,, 
didn’t know about. Therefore they 
were ready to believe we had done 
the same.” 

It began to sink in that the Is- 
raelis had won. The Israelis had 
won and Shaya was dead. 

I was suddenly furious. They had 
no right to victory, no right to joy! 

I threw myself on Sapir. I didn’t try 
to strangle him. RaAer, I tried to 



remove his adam’s apple. 

By the time they pulled me loose, 
Sapir was past breathing but they 
tell me they saved him; there were 
two officers in the room who also 
had medical degrees and one of 
them did an emergency tracheotomy 
with a pocketknife. Meanwhile, 
several others were roughing me up, 
to my deep satisfaction. I kept hop- 
ing Aey would kill me and to en- 
courage this, I began to shout pro- 
Arab and anti-Semitic slogans. “In- 
ternational Jewish bankers!” I 
screamed. “Jewish Communist plot- 
ters!” Someone finally hit me on 
the back of the neck and everything 
turned red-black and faded out. 

You would think that once the 
Arabs found out that most of the Is- 
raeli planes and tanks were illu- 
sions, they would have started the 
war up again but it didn’t work out 
that way. There still remained the 
problem of determining which were 
real and which weren’t — or other- 
wise wasting a very great deal of 
fire power and disposing one’s 
forces to defend against non-existent 
enemy units. Until they (or the Rus- 
sians) had worked out suitable coun- 
termeasures, an armistice seemed 
wise. Besides, since it had ended so 
quickly, they hadn’t had time to lose 
any territory, for a change. 

Meanwhile, the Israelis did turn 
on the Temple as planned but then 
promptly turned it off again. They 
had made their point. Next they in- 
vited the religions of the world to 
take turns projecting their own ver-

anniversary of the dedication of 
both the First and Second Temples. 
In the Middle East, symbolic ac- 
tions count for a lot more than they 
do in Worcester, Massachusetts. 
Besides, the Israelis have enough 
holidays cluttering up their calendar 
now. They don’t need another one 
to cut further into their productivity. 

Another reason why I didn’t get 
scared enough to do something sen- 
sible like panic was that while all 
this last-minute work was going on, 
I was growing up in a most delight- 
ful way. With Shaya’s help, I had 
been getting big all the time. With- 
out her, I don’t know what this lit- 
tle boy would have done. Actually I 
do know, but I don’t like to think 
about it. 

Enough of all that. I have to stop 
being so flip because I have some- 
thing really important to say and I 
want to keep my distance from 
those feelings of guilt and grief I 
can’t handle. 

Let me tell you a little of my re- 
lationship with Shaya; let me tell 
you as much as I can bear to talk 
about concerning what Shaya was 
like. 

She had been born in Safed. Her 
family had never left Palestine. At 
times as secret Jews, at other times 
openly, they had kept alive in its 
homeland the ancient civilization of 
King David and the Prophets. 
During the long, lonely years of iso- 
lation and despair, when it seemed 
that the Master of the Universe had 
turned away from His chosen 

84 



people, they had turned to mysti- 
cism and magic. A deep, esoteric 
lore had been developed in secret 
by the handful of faithful who 
stayed on in their Holy Land. This 
mystic learning was, in fact, the 
basis for the tradition that my friend * 
Aryeh had become so engrossed in. 

Naturally, surrounded by enemies 
as they were — of late, surrounded ! 
by Moslem enemies — they had be- j 
come adept not only at magic but ' 
also at intrigue. Shaya’s family was ■ 
not only high in the history of 
Jewish mysticism and magic, it was 
also high in the revolutionary Arab > 
underground. She told me a number 
of things that I find it very hard to ' 
believe. For example, that the ' 
Mafia is secretly a Moslem organi- 
zation. It arose, she said, from a 
Moslem clan, the Ma’afique, who 
ruled Sicily in the Middle Ages. 
When the Christians regained con- 
trol of the island, the Moslems went 
underground. Hence, she said, the 
Mafia preference for poisoning and ' 
blackmail, their love of intrigue, 
their fierce family loyalty, their 
elaborate system of secret identifica- 
tion, copied from their rivals, the 
Masons and the Knights Templars. { 

She also asserted that while a .* 
good deal of the international trade I 
in drugs and prostitues was, through > 
the Mafia, controlled by secret Mos- 
lems, a good deal of the interna- 
tional movement toward Arab inde- 
pendence from the colonial powers 
was actually led by Jews! Just as in , 
the West idealistic young Jews had ] 

{ 

GALAXY ; 

I' 



fought to support the aspirations for 
freedom of every minority except 
their own, so in the colonial Mid- 
dle East, the sons and daughters of 
Jewish merchants and professionals 
in places like Beirut, Damascus or 
Cairo had been among the early 
founders of the underground move- 
ments for freedom from colonial 
oppression. 

Of course their contribution 
could not be acknowledged openly but 
nevertheless some of the original 
Jewish members of the former 
anti-colonial underground were now 
high up in the governing circles of 
the Arab world, all with safe new 
Moslem backgrounds. Among 
these, she hinted, were some of the 
better-known enemies of Israel. She 
told me that, for example, the re- 
cent assassination of a prominent 
Arab leader, which no one in the 
West could explain, was because 
some of his own people had learned 
his true identity. 

Shaya had two families, two 
complete identities. She was the 
daughter of an Israeli diplomat, 
granddaughter of one of the leading 
figures in the revival of the Hebrew 
language as a living tongue. In 
this family she was the great- 
granddaughter of a celebrated mys- 
tic Talmudist. But she also had 
another family. In the half of her 
childhood spent in Damascus rather 
than in Saf^, she was the daughter 
of a Moslem merchant whose wife 
had converted to his faith from 
Judaism when they were married. 




THE HOLY TEMPLE

Her brother was a graduate in busi- 
ness administration of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago; he was also high 
up in the PLO. While in the United 
States, he had successfully recruited 
several leftist Jewish students into 
an all-Jewish battalion of the PLO 
now stationed in Syria. 

Each family knew about and ap- 
proved of her association with the 
other. It was for the sake of the 
cause. Her Safed family accepted 
her Syrian connection as a neces- 
sary unpleasantness, something that 
a little country surrounded by 
enemies had to resort to. Her 
Damascus family thought of her as 
a kind of unofficial ambassador to 
those Jews who, because of their 
mystic, religious tradition and be- 
cause they really were natives of the 
region, might have more in common 
with their Arab neighbors than with 
those Jews who had brought strange 
secular Western ways into the Holy 
Land. There were, after all, in 
Jerusalem highly visible groups of 
Jews who still refused to accept the 
existence of the Jewish state. There 
were Jews who draped black flags 
and bunting on the Israeli independ- 
ence day. 

Which family really was hers? I 
never found out. Both families de- 
rived from the same Safed mystics; 
the branch point was only a genera- 
tion ago. Why did she have any- 
thing to do with me? Look, I know 
I’m not that great a lover. 

At first I tried to tell myself that 
she did the same with all the boys. 



I told myself that I should enjoy my 
good fortune and that since 1 had 
nothing to hide, there was no way 
that our relationship could lead to 
any betrayal. 

But my feelings changed. There 
are some things a person can’t dis- 
guise or fake. She was for real. We 
did a lot of talking about all sorts of 
things. She told me once, for in- 
stance, that I was the third man she 
had ever slept with other than for 
reasons of state, and that the other 
two were both men she had loved 
who were now dead. I believed her; 
she cried when she told me that. 
Besides, she knew I didn’t have any 
secrets. If anyone in the world was 
in a position to know it, she was. 
But she stayed with me anyway. 

Her explanation was absurd, of 
course. She said I was a genius and 
was just too modest to realize it. 
She claimed that my miserable 
affliction of obsessive generation of 
invention ideas was proof I was 
some sort of Mozart of inventing. 
She even claimed that I was an 
“unconscious” Jew because I was a 
Seventh Day Adventist who had 
private doubts about Jesus but not 
about most of the practical side of 
my religion, which — she claimed 
— was copied from Judaism. 

All this is getting us nowhere: 
I’m not going on with my story be- 
cause I can’t face what came next 
and I’m not really communicating 
about our relationship. Let me try to 
take you through a typical evening 
and then I promise I’ll finish this

story quickly. 

When I got home from that silly 
barbershop, a very domestic scene 
usually waited for me. It was like 
playing house. Shaya would have 
supper ready. I would usually insist 
on stopping on the way home to 
buy some little surprise, usually 
flowers picked up from a street 
vendor but sometimes a bottle of Is- 
raeli wine (which is very very 
good), sometimes some perfume, 
sometimes a silly trinket. 

Once she got quite upset when I 
brought home some copper jewelry. 
She said the pattern inlaid in enamel 
was an ancient sign for evil. Then 
she laughed and said she could 
make it all right by wearing it 
wrapped in tinfoil, which would re- 
flect the evil back into itself. And 
that’s how she wore it! 

There was always a fancy white 
tablecloth on the table. We never 
had guests at our meal, but 
people — friends of hers — often 
dropped in afterward. We had a lit- 
tle upright piano and one of her 
friends always seemed to head 
straight for it. He loved to play 
(Thopin and somehow the sound of 
Chopin etudes is the musical theme 
of my memories of that happiest 
time in my life. 

There was a lot of music. Often 
we sat around and sang, accom- 
panied by someone’s guitar. There 
are a number of hauntingly beautiful 
Israeli songs that are somewhere on 
the edge between popular and folk 
music — sort of the Israeli equivalent 



of American country western, ex- 
cept that they are gentler sounding 
and seem to have melodies and 
themes more appropriate for urban 
life. One very touching song that 
they told me was at the top of the 
charts when they were teeny- 
boppers had a father promising his 
little girl that the war he was going 
away to fight in was the very last 
war there would ever be. 

There was a lot of adolescent- 
type talk about the meaning of life, 
the purpose of the universe, etc. 
Except that these weren’t teen- 
agers. One woman who often had 
interesting things to say was a 
philosophy professor. There was 
another woman, a violinist, who 
used to play sad music on the violin 
for a while, then burst into 
passionate speeches about the injus- 
tice of the human condition, how 
unfair it was that we should have to 
grow old, that some babies were 
bom deformed, that some are rich 
and some are poor. I learned that 
her husband was high up in the 
government and that he was a 
physician who had made important 
contributions to research on slowing 
the rate of aging. 

The guests never stayed more 
than a couple of hours. Usually the 
evening would wind up with some- 
one trying to draw me out about my 
latest invention ideas. I had never 
before been listened to so respect- 
fully. No matter how weird my 
ideas, they were always considered 
seriously and responded to with 



THE HOLY TEMPLE 



87 



careful thoughtfulness. Often I 
would find myself arguing that my 
ideas were foolish and worthless 
while several guests defended them. 
For example, one evening I had the 
notion that a spaceship could be 
launched efficiently riding a cushion 
of maser energy produced by the in- 
teraction of a maser beam emitted 
by a source on the spaceship and 
another beam, exactly opposite in 
phase, from a ground source. 

My idea was that half of the 
energy expenditure could be on the 
ground (for generating the beam 
there) and so the amount of fuel and 
equipment needed on board the 
spaceship could be halved, com- 
pared to a more conventional pro- 
pulsion system. Of course the prob- 
lem would be one of getting suffi- 
ciently accurate collimation — the 
same problem involved in making a 
giant hologram. 

You would think that I would 
have been optimistic and the others 
pessimistic. In fact, I just couldn’t 
believe it would work, while my 
guests argued that it was a reasona- 
ble “next” project after the Temple 
project was turned over to the en- 
gineers and routine operating crew. 
They pointed out that it was not 
necessary that all the technical prob- 
lems be solved at the time the first 
crude idea emerged; we could face 
the problems and solve them if we 
had to. They were, after all, only 
“engineering,” not anything fun- 
damental. 

Listen: They even reacted with 



respect and cautious interest to my 
idea for a probe that would reach 
through a black hole to see what 
was on the other side. The probe 
would use modulation of relativistic 
phase-velocity waves in a gravito- 
gravitic oscillation (matter-generated 
gravity waves on one axis and 
anti-matter-generated on the other); 
by avoiding effort to transmit 
wave-velocity information, I thought 
we might beat the relativis- 
tic limitations on what could pene- 
trate the black hole’s infinite gravity 
sink. They didn’t even scoff at the 
obvious fact that it would take a 
Brand X version of relativity theory 
to get different gravitic waves from 
matter and anti-matter. In short, for 
the first time in my life I found my 
fountain of invention ideas some- 
thing other than a terrible affliction. 
To sum it all up: I stopped drink- 
ing. 

The key wish — I mean ques- 
tion — for me, those days, was why 
Shaya had taken up with me when 
she knew so little about me. I never 
got up the nerve to say, “Who or- 
dered you to?” but that was what 
was on my mind. She kept telling 
me that that was the way she was, 
that she had always wanted to love 
a genius and be loved by him, and I 
was a genius and therefore. My 
wish, of course, was that she was 
telling the truth. 

I also enjoyed my work enor- 
mously. It was just as enjoyable, I 
must add, working for the Arabs, 
but it was different here. We had 



88 



GALAXY 



less money and there were more 
problems, working for the Israelis, 
but it was very satisfying to con- 
front each day a battalion of varied 
difficulties almost but not quite too 
much for me. I had a delightful 
feeling of being stretched and of 
growing in response to the stretch- 
ing. Some of the problems were in- 
terpersonal: I was the manager of a 
team of creative young scientists 
and engineers and some of them 
were just plain temperamental. 
Again and again I had to find a way 
to make both sides of some silly 
disagreement feel that they had 
won. Then there were innumerable 
technical problems. We had to im- 
provise, experiment, improvise, 
guess, improvise. I think that for 
the first time in my life I began to 
really respect myself. That early- 
middle-aged kid who had boasted 
foolishly to the hostess on that fa- 
mous El Al flight was starting to 
grow up. 

★ ★ ★ 



Holograph day came. That even- 
ing just after sunset we were going 
to turn on the Holy Temple. It was 
decided that I would go home, pick 
up Shaya, and then we would drive 
to a building near the Mosque of 
Omar, from which we could watch 
the great event. However, when I 
arrived at the waiting car outside 
the barber shop, Leftenant Dagell 
crisply informed me that we would 



drive directly to a different “safe” 
place near the Mosque. She said 
that she could not tell me why the 
plans had changed. I didn’t have 
much time to argue with her. Al- 
most as soon as the words were out 
of her mouth, the sirens in 
Jerusalem started to keen. It was the 
red alert signal: Take cover at once. 
We ran back to the barbershop and 
I ran down the stairs to the smelly 
room. The bright lights came on as 
usual but when I tumbled into the 
giant laboratory room, there was no 
one in sight. A voice from a con- 
cealed speaker somewhere overhead 
instructed me to walk to a certain 
piece of equipment and turn certain 
knobs and press certain switches. 
Next thing, the section of floor on 
which I was standing began to de- 
scend rapidly and I was lowered 
into a room I had never seen be- 
fore, a room containing men dres- 
sed in senior Israeli military uni- 
forms. There was a television 
screen on one wall, and the men 
were seated in front of the screen in 
two semicircular rows on sort of 
long curved backless benches. 
Among them was a face I recog- 
nized: Dr. Sapir’s. However, the 
body to which it was attached was 
differently clothed than it had been 
back in the hospital. Now it was in 
a general’s outfit. 

The elevator had lowered me into 
the comer of the room to the left of 
the television screen. There was a 
wire grille around the section into 
which I had been lowered and I 



THE HOLY TEMPLE 



89 



noticed that there was no way I 
could open it from the inside. Dr.- 
General Sapir walked over and did 
something to a row of control but- 
tons set in the wall about a yard 
from where I stood; the grille slid 
up into the ceiling and I stepped off 
the elevator platform. 

“The Arabs have launched an at- 
tack,” he said without any other 
opening remarks. His face was very 
grim. “There was a leak and they 
had heard about our plans for this 
evening. We are switching to a con- 
tingency plan.” 

“How serious is the situation?” I 
asked. I also was concerned about 
Shaya, but I didn’t feel right about 
bringing up a personal matter until I 
had a better picture of the larger 
situation. I knew that Israel was a 
small country surrounded by power- 
ful enemies, and I realized that any 
attack could be a real threat to na- 
tional survival. It had not yet begun 
to sink in that my project might 
have precipitated the attack. 

“They have much better equip- 
ped forces than we expected. They 
have received very extensive mate- 
rial supplies from the Soviets, and 
so the massed air squadrons that are 
now moving toward an attack on us 
outnumber our air force by about 
ten to one; their massed armor out- 
numbers ours by about twenty to 
one. They seem to be holding back 
much of their ground infantry so for 
the moment we are not too far out- 
numbered there: only about three to 
one, which we feel gives us 



superiority in that regard.” 

My heart sank to my shoes. I 
found myself wondering whether 
the victorious Arabs would hold me 
as a war criminal. Would I be exe- 
cuted? Would the Israelis be foolish 
enough to try to hold out until they 
were crushed? If so, would I be 
killed in the fighting? How could I 
persuade them to surrender now, 
before a great deal of useless 
bloodshed? 

“What do you plan to do?” I 
asked. I had tried to keep my voice 
sounding calm but it came out in a 
sort of high-pitched, breathless 
shriek. 

“Our plan must be secret for the 
moment,” he answered very 
grimly. “You don’t have the clear- 
ance to he informed but we want 
you here anyway. You may be of 
some assistance.” 

“Then you aren’t going to sur- 
render right away?” I was practi- 
cally Jumping up and down with 
nervous tension. I could feel my 
chin trembling. 

He just stared at me for a mo- 
ment before he replied. “No, we 
don’t have that in mind,” he finally 
said, speaking quite calmly as if the 
situation were not hopeless. 

“Here they come!” someone 
shouted and the doctor or general 
whirled around to stare at the televi- 
sion screen, along with everj'one 
else in the room, including me. I 
assumed the voice meant the Arab 
attack and I scrunched down a little, 
half expecting to feel the vibration 



90 



GALAXY 



of a nearby bomb blast. 

On the screen I saw from some 
distance what looked to be a row of 
cliffs in the hills just east of 
Jerusalem. It was a view of desert 
desolation. Suddenly a section of 
cliff began to move sideways to- 
ward the right. It was hard to judge 
scale since there was not even a 
bush in sight in that empty desert of 
rocks and sand, but I got the 
impression that the movement in- 
volved a giant volume of rock and 
soil. A great gaping vertical crack 
formed in the cliff side and out of it 
moved many tiny shapes, from time 
to time throwing brilliant reflections 
that dazzled the television cameras 
momentarily. The cameras zoomed 
in on them and I realized the shapes 
were tanks and armored vehicles 
that I presumed were troop carriers. 
The tanks and other vehicles were 
all elaborately camouflaged and so I 
was puzzled about where the bril- 
liant flashes of reflection had been 
coming from, but after a while I 
concluded it was the windshields on 
some of the armored vehicles. 

I tried to count how many tanks 
and other vehicles there were but it 
was impossible to do so. The televi- 
sion scene kept switching back and 
forth from close shots to distant pic- 
tures, but even the long shots did 
not seem to be able to cover the en- 
tire enormous force rapidly deploy- 
ing through that one gap in the 
hills, which I now realized was 
truly Brobdingnagian; some twenty 
tanks seemed to be emerging ab- 



reast with plenty of space between 
them. 

Evidently, I thought, this was the 
Arab invading force. I had to hand 
it to those clever Arabs. Hiding 
those forces in the desert like that 
was such a prodigious feat, it really 
had earned Ihem their victory. 

The television eye panned upward 
toward a sky that had no clouds in 
it but was almost covered 
nevertheless — with planes. I had 
never imagined a sky could be so 
full of aircraft. Rows on rows on 
rows moved in steady formation 
from horizon to horizon. Again it 
was impossible to judge the actual 
number since the television screen 
could not hold the image of a suffi- 
ciently large slice of the sky. A 
special lens would have been neces- 
sary, one that encompassed a full 
hemisphere of view. 

Suddenly Sapir was next to me 
again, or perhaps he had never left. 
He pulled my face to one side, 
away from the screen, forcing me to 
attend to his words. “What do you 
think of that scene?” he asked. He 
seemed incredibly unterrified. I had 
to admire the nobility of the Israelis 
in defeat — or was he another deep 
double agent? 

I suddenly realized that those 
planes were probably not just flying 
around for sightseeing. Many must 
be carrying bombs, perhaps even 
nuclear weapons. And Shaya was 
somewhere out there. The war was 
over, lost before it ever began, and 
so there was no shame in giving 



THE HOLY TEMPLE 



91 



sions of the Temple. Of course the 
Arabs refused to cooperate but var- 
ious non-Arab Moslem sects were 
quick to accept the offer and it was 
not long before renegade Arab 
groups were cooperating with them 
unofficially. 

Meanwhile, I had been shipped 
back to America and here I was 
able to expiate some of my guilt by 
persuading my Seventh Day Ad- 
ventist friends to cooperate. That 
started a stampede of Christian par- 
ticipation and soon there was a co- 
operatively designed pan-Christian 
Temple available for the major 
Christian holidays. The only hold- 
outs were the Orthodox Russians, 
but that was to be expected. 

Increasingly there was friendly 
competition about designing more 
and more elaborate or authentic 
Temples. Perhaps different religions 
would have viewed dividing up a 
single material Temple as a desecra- 
tion, but somehow they found tak- 
ing turns filling the same space with 
different immaterial projections ac- 
ceptable; turning off a projected or 
holographic Temple did not seem 
the same as destroying a real one, 
particularly when it was understood 
that the Temple just turned off was 
scheduled to be turned on again. 

To the world’s astonishment, the 
one Temple that was not regularly 
projected holographically was one 
for the Jews! There was preliminary 
planning by the Israeli government 
to do so but the orthodox religi- 
ous parties viewed it as some sort 



of desecration. They withdrew from 
the government in a snit, unwilling 
to have anything to do with people 
who had even considered such a 
sacrilege. The Prime Minister made 
things worse by publicly denying 
that the government would have 
ever been so blind and depraved as to 
approve such a thing. This, of 
course, made it impossible for any 
successor government to do so. 

Once the religious parties had 
withdrawn from the government co- 
alition, a new election became 
necessary and the new Knesset was 
so evenly balanced that the only 
possible coalition appeared to be the 
only one that also was impossible; a 
coalition between the left-wing 
labor groups and the religious 
parties — the very coalition from 
which the religious parties had 
withdrawn when they caused the old 
government to fall. 

Then came the next surprise for 
the world. The right-wing parties, 
the next strongest block, put to- 
gether a shaky majority by inviting 
support from the handful of Arab 
members of the Knesset who rep- 
resented Arab nationalist interests! 
The result was a government that 
was actually able to bargain credi- 
bly with the Arab states. 

So in a way my dream finally 
came true: Any war involving 

Jerusalem would obviously en- 
danger the projections, and so war 
in Ae Holy Land became less and 
less acceptable. The various groups, 
Israeli and Arab, were compelled to 



94 



GAIAXY 



start some sort of dialogue. Because 
the right wing, now in power, had 
always been the most nationalist, 
expansionist, and anti-Arab, in that 
marvelously twisted way that things 
work in that part of the world, the 
Arabs found them easier to deal 
with, even ignoring the presence of 
Arabs in the government itself. 
They felt that the right wing was 
less hypocritical and more predicta- 
ble because its traditional views 
were closer to the traditional Arab 
stereotype of Zionism. 

However, about when I thought 
things were settling down and I was 
starting to think about rebuilding 
my personal life, the Israelis and 
Arabs, perhaps as a sign of their 
new cooperation, perhaps as some 



sort of revenge, identified me pub- 
licly as the inventor of the mac- 
ro-holographic projector. That led 
the DIA, or whatever they call 
themselves to grab me and keep 
me here in this super-luxurious 
prison or nuthouse. 

There are a million problems 
concerning the implementation of a 
whole family of new technologies 
using macro-holography. They seem 
to think that I am an expert. There- 
fore, they keep bringing me 
questions, and I am supposed to an- 
swer them, as if I were some sort of 
intelligent computer. Now you 
know that my problem is not that I 
don’t have answers. My trouble is 
that I keep on producing answers, a 
continual flood of answers, but not 




to the questions that come from my 
masters, captors, good friends, fel- 
low patriots, or whatever they are. 
And therefore my answers usually 
displease them. 

I still can’t control what questions 
I’ll answer, although every now and 
then it’s pretty obvious why a par- 
ticular question got answered. For 
example, it occurred to me today 
that I had no objective proof that 
Shaya had bought it in an Arab raid 
on our apartment. Maybe, instead, 
the outbreak of the war made it un- 
necessary to continue her in that as- 
signment. 

Could I really be sure she loved 
me? I don’t know whether I wish 
she is alive and I was a dupe or that 
she really loved me and is dead 
now. But I can see why that doubt 
immediately preceded the next idea 
I had. 

I think I’ve just invented a practi- 
cal form of psychic teleportation. 
I’m just about ready to bust out of 



this dump; I’ll try to teleport to Lud 
Airport, just outside Tel Aviv. 

I want to take a look at the 
hostesses getting off the next sev- 
eral El A I flights. Then, in case she 
was only on that flight in order to 
meet me, I think I’ll take a look at 
our old apartment to see if there are 
signs of struggle. For that matter, I 
may chat with some of the 
neighbors. Finally, I think I’ll let 
the Israelis “catch” me. They 
might think I was pretty valuable 
again if they see some demonstra- 
tions of my new teleportation trick. 

In any case. I’m not so depressed 
suddenly. After all, if I can figure 
out a way to jump through space, 
then shades of old Albert, a way of 
jumping through time just may pop 
into my head one of these days, be- 
tween improvements on the arbalest 
and ways of delinting belly buttons. 
Maybe the reason Shaya liked me 
was that we were already old 
friends when we met. ★

GALAXY 



A Message from the Publisher; 



A NEW EDITOR 



With this issue GALAXY has a 
new editor. As we reported last 
month, James P. Baen has left the 
magazine after more than four years 
to become science-fiction editor at 
Ace Books. And stepping into the 
position he filled so well is John J. 
Pierce. 

J.J., as he prefers to be called, is 
new to magazine publishing — but 
hardly new to science fiction. He 
became a convert in 1950, when he 
was nine years old and his parents 
took him to see the premiere of 
“Destination Moon.” Before long 
he was an avid sf reader. The first 
story he remembers reading was 
James Blish’s “Surface 
Tension” — in an early issue of 
GALAXY, of course. 

Until now he has pursued science 
fiction as a hobby while working as 
a reporter for the Daily Advance of 
Dover, N.J., and other newspapers. 
During the last decade he became 
known in the sf community through 
his amateur publications (“fan- 
zines”) “Renaissance” and “Ten- 
sion, Apprehension and Dissen- 
sion.” He also had a regular col- 
umn in “Reason” magazine and 
published reviews and commentary 
elsewhere. 



Two years ago his research into 
the life and work of Cordwainer 
Smith, who was one of galaxy’s 
stars before his death in 1966, led 
to an assignment to edit “The Best 
of Cordwainer Smith,” now in its 
second printing. He has also edited 
“The Best of Murray Leinster” and 
“The Best of Raymond Z. Gallun,” 
both of which will appear next year; 
and, as time permits, he is working 
on an “interpretive history” of sf 
called “Imagination and Evolu- 
tion.” 

Since coming to galaxy on Au- 
gust 1, J.J. has seen through the 
preparation for publication of two 
issues that had been mostly planned 
by Jim Baen but this month’s issue 
directly reflects his influence — for 
example, the debuts of book re- 
viewer Paul Walker and artists Amy 
Harlib and Joan Woods. 

Beginning next month, you’ll be 
seeing new material J.J. picked 
himself — discoveries from the 
wealth of new talent, submissions 
resulting from his many contacts in 
the sf field and a few real surprises 
of other kinds. We think galaxy 
readers have a lot to look forward 
to. 

— AEA, Publisher

What Josephine the Plumber 
Doesn't Know About Comets! 

HY ARE DISASTER NOVELS enter- 
taining? 

How can we take pleasure from 
watching great cities reduced to 
flaming ruins; thousands of people 
crushed, burned, trampled, drowned 
and buried alive? 

The question occurred to me 
while reading Larry Niven’s and 
Jerry Poumelle’s Lucifer’s Hammer, 
a disaster novel to end all disaster 
novels (but don’t bet on it). It 
brought to mind a similar question I 



Paul Walker 

had asked myself years ago. 

Once upon a time I used to watch 
bullfights on television and I en- 
joyed them very much. A friend of 
mine pointed out that it was a cruel 
and brutal sport and that if I liked 
it, I must be a cruel and brutal per- 
son. I wondered if he was right for 
as hard as I tried, I could not feel 
for the bull. 

My friend saw the animal as a 
poor dumb beast; I saw it as a vi- 
cious, stupid creature. My friend 
saw the matador as a murderer; I 
saw him as an artist. 

The point is that my friend and I 
saw two different things. And what 
we saw determined how we felt 
about the thing. 

Pleasure, like pain, is a kind of 
stimulation. One we think of as 
positive. We know that there is 
often a fine line between them. In- 
tense pleasure can be painful, and a 
lesser degree of pain can be 
pleasurable. The sensations of fear 
or grief are painful, for instance, 
and yet we ride the roller coaster 



100 



GALAXY 



and watch soap operas to experience 
both sensations. 

It is seemingly a matter of de- 
gree, then, that determines whether 
a thing is pleasurable or painful. 
But there is more to it than that in 
the matter of bullfighting and disas- 
ter stories. We are deriving pleasure 
from watching the pain of others. 
Or are we? 

If we are, and if we are reasona- 
bly normal, then the effect of a 
bullfight or a disaster story would 
be so tragic that we would be in 
tears throughout; but we know from 
experience that we will be thrilled. 
Why? 

TTie answer is that both the 
bullfight and the disaster story em- 
ploy the same dramatic principles. 
Both are kinds of fiction and even 
though the bullfight is a real event, 
in which real blood is spilled, it is 
the illusion rather than the reality 
that excites us. 

Imagine a bull securely tied up in 
a field. A man comes into the field 
and, standing at a safe distance, be- 
gins waving a cape at the bull and 
sticking it with a sword. How 
would you feel? Incensed. Not only 
at man’s cruelty but at his stupidity. 
And how would you feel toward the 
bull? Sympathetic. So sympathetic 
that if the bull suddenly tore loose 
and killed the man, you would 
scarcely blame it. 

But now imagine the bull loose in 
the field. A man comes into it. The 
bull sees him. He charges at him. 
There is neither time nor place to 



run. The man is armed with only a 
flimsy cape and a sword. The bull 
has horns like knives and the power 
to gut the man with a twist of its 
head. Yet the man stands perfectly 
still and by means of the cape and 
the sword, he begins to defend him- 
self. 

Where do your sympathies lie 
now? Suddenly the bull is no longer 
a poor dumb beast but a monster; 
the man is no longer a murderer but 
a hero. 

My friend could not see this. He 
could not see the drama; he saw 
only the principle of the thing. He 
could not feel anything other than 
indignation. Our difference lay in 
the direction of our sympathies. He 
felt for the bull, I for the man. 
Similarly in disaster stories, if our 
sympathies were directed solely to 
the victims of the disaster, we 
would be too filled with grief to 
feel anything but sorrow; instead, 
our sympathy for the main pro- 
tagonists and their fate overrides 
everything else. 

To us, they are humanity. They 
are us. It is their fate we are most 
intensely concerned with. So while 
we may see thousands of others suf- 
fering terrible deaths, we are kept 
from grief by our hope for our pro- 
tagonists’ survival. And if they do 
survive, as they usually do, the 
emotion they leave us with is hope. 

But in order for this to be so, the 
writer has first to make us care for 
them; the extent to which he is suc- 
cessful in this will determine the 



BOOKSHELF 



101 



I 



amount of suspense 'we feel over 
their struggles to survive. 

It is this success that makes Larry 
Niven’s and Jerry Poumelle’s 
Lucifer’s Hammer one of the most 
exciting novels I have ever read. 

But there is more to it than this. 
However real the illusion of a disas- 
ter story seems, the audience knows 
from experience that it is witnessing 
an illusion, a performance; and it 
knows a lot more about the dramat- 
ic principles involved than it con- 
sciously realizes. So when a spec- 
tator expresses admiration for a 
sword-thrust by the matador or for a 
scene in which a hundred people are 
buried alive under a collapsing 
building, he is not expressing his 
own brutality but an admiration for 
the skill of the artist. 

And it is the skill with which 
Niven and Poumelle have created 
their illusion of the near end of the 
world that makes the book so im- 
pressive. 

It is a classic. The best disaster 
novel since When Worlds Collide 
— better, in fact. And if you think 
I am letting my enthusiasm for it 
get the best of me, let me say that 
there is no end of things to get en- 
thused about. For once, science fic- 
tion has produced a story that is the 
equal of its concept. 

It is about a comet — or rather, 
pieces of a comet — that strike the 
earth, and the aftermath; the man 
who sights the comet beyond Nep- 
tune; the television journalist who 
does a documentary on it; the sci- 

102 



entists who speculate fervently on 
its course; the astronauts who are 
sent up to get a good look at it. 
And the women in their lives. 

The comet is not supposed to hit 
the earth. The chances against it are 
billions to one. Then millions to 
one. Then thousands. .hundreds. 

The protagonists are forced to 
flee for their lives across a chaotic 
landscape filled with people driven 
mad by grief and starvation. A 
blinding salt rain falls constantly. 
Rivers overflow. Dams break. Tidal 
waves wipe out coastal areas. And 
there is the prospect of an early 
winter, portent of a new ice age that 
will eliminate the remnants of hu- 
manity. 

One by one the protagonists reach 
the only place of safety, a valley 
called the Stronghold, in which a 
handful of farmers and refugees 
struggles to survive against the 
weather. 

But the safety of the valley is an 
illusion for soon it is besieged by an 
army of cannibals led by a mad 
preacher who has the best chance to 
conquer the world since Moham- 
med. 

From the testimonials on the 
blurb that compare the novel to On 
the Beach, you might imagine the 
book has an equally downbeat end- 
ing. But if you know anything of 
Niven and Poumelle, you know 
who comes to the rescue. The real 
hero of the book is a nuclear power 
plant nobody loved. 

The characters, and there are doz- 

GALAXY 



ens of them, are all respectably 
depicted although with the excep- 
tion of a few who stand out by con- 
trast, they tend to look pretty much 
alike. The real character of the 
novel is the community of the 
Stronghold. This is not clear until 
late in the book, when all the main 
characters are brought together and 
events that went before come to 
seem merely an introduction to what 
comes after. 

The irony of the thing is that 
while Niven and Poumelle take a 
Heinlein stand on most everything 
(and there is an Ayn Rand-ish feel 
about the story), they have actually 
written a Marxian novel; for despite 
the fact that all of the protagonists 
are staunch individualists, it is the 
community itself that the novel is 
all about. No single character pre- 
dominates over the rest. No charac- 
ter resolves all the problems the 
Stronghold faces. Rather, it is the 
communal effort that ultimately 
saves the world. Just as in an 
Eisenstein movie. 

The initial descriptions of life in 
California are fine, with delightful 
touches of satire. The disaster itself 
is brilliantly described. And the 
aftermath — which had .me worried, 
having read so many aftermath 
novels — was consistently absorbing. 
There is simply not a dull page in 
the book. 

Nor an unimaginative incident. It 
is hard to believe it did not take 
Niven and Poumelle years to think 
all this out. And while I am sure

there are a hundred of amateur

work to prove them wrong in this or

will ^ plenty of good ideas left 
over. The second greatest joy of the 
novel is the feel of real sf minds at 
work on a level that would do 
honor to John W. Campbell. 

Thirdly, there are individual 
scenes that are worth the price of 
the book itself. Particularly the ul-

and exciting scenes. 

When The Mote in God’s Eye ap- 
peared, there was much speculation 
on what was Niven’s and what was 
Poumelle’s, with Niven getting 
most of the credit. Perhaps rightly. 
But that is not the case with 
Lucifer’s Hammer. While the awe- 
some scope of so many of the con- 
cepts seems typically Niven, the hard 
substance of the reality of the book 
that gives it its power seems typi- 
cally Poumelle, but never have two 
talents blended so felicitously to 
produce a work that seems greater 
than either of them could have done 
alone. Lucifer’s Hammer is a gem. 

I loved it.

Varley’s Awf'ulitchy 

There are two events of least sig- 
nificance in a writer’s life: his first 
published short story and his first 
published novel. Unless, of course, 
they are the best things he is ever to 
write — a thought too terrible to con- 
template. But normally, despite the 
euphoria of the author and the 
“bright promise” promised by the 
critics, no one remembers either the 
short story or the novel years 
later — a lapse for which more than 
one successful writer has been 
grateful. 

If a writer’s first novel is very 
bad, readers will expect his second 
to be worse; but if his first novel is 



very good, readers will expect his 
second to be a classic. And if it 
isn’t, they are disappointed. There- 
fore, it is safer for a talented young 
writer to produce a merely “good” 
novel the first time out. Something 
more than competent but not quite 
brilliant or wholly original. Some- 
thing that will leave the readers 
curious about the quality of his next 
one. Something such as John Var- 
ley has written in his first novel. 
The Ophiuchi Hotline. 

Varley is a young writer who 
lives in Oregon and his short stories 
have already established him as one 
of “the best new talents in the genre. 
His novel is about a far future time 
when mankind has been driven from 
the Earth by the enigmatic Invaders, 
who came to liberate those whom 
they regard as the only truly in- 
telligent species on the planet — the 
whales and dolphins. Humanity has 
fled to the Eight Worlds of the solar 
system, where they hope the Invad- 
ers will not follow. 

Varley’s heroine is named Lilo. 
She is a genetic engineer who 
specializes in producing new breeds 
of edible plant meats, which are the 
staple foods of her civilization. But 
her real interest is in producing new 
breeds of human beings, a practice 
outlawed by the government. She is 
caught at it and sentenced to death. 
And she dies. But there is someone 
who still has need of her and who 
has the power to save her life, even 
after death. Or, at least, the power 
to clone her. 



104 



GALAXY 



“Boss Tweed,” the ex-President 
of Luna, fancies himself the future 
savior of the Earth and he has Lilo 
cloned so she can work for him on 
his private fortress-world of 
Poseidon near Jupiter, another In- 
vader stronghold. Lilo does not be- 
lieve in Tweed’s cause and she is 
not one to accept captivity. She 
tries to escape. She is killed again. 
And cloned again. In fact, Tweed is 
prepared to clone her as many times 
as it takes to gain her cooperation. 

What Tweed does not know is 
that in a ship orbiting Saturn she 
has a clone of her own, guarded by 
an unusual ally named Parameter/ 
Solstice, who is a symb — a half- 
human, half-alien creature fully able 
and willing to live indefinitely in 
space. 

On Poseidon Lilo and a friend 
plot to escape by means of a black 
hole. But they are guarded by a 
ferocious army of clones — some 
men, some women- — named Vaffa. 

And midway through the novel, 
the story begins. 

Three Lilos go into action against 
Tweed, Vaffa, the Invaders and the 
source of the Ophiuchi Hotline 
itself — the alien messages from 
another star that have given hu- 
manity the knowledge of advanced 
genetics that has made its clone- 
oriented culture possible. Somehow 
all these factors are tied together in 
the solution of the mystery of the 
Invaders, and each Lilo has her part 
of the mystery to solve. 

Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? And 



it is. All very old hat but good 
clean fun just the same. Varley has 
written a complex and eventful 
novel that is easy and amusihg to 
read. His ideas are interesting and 
well-thought-out. His characters are 
likeable, their adventures exciting. 
His backgrounds are colorful and 
concisely detailed. And he writes' 
some of the best sex scenes I’ve 
read. Scenes that are pleasurable 
rather than clinical or sweaty. 

The book’s worst flaw is that its 
heroine is not much of a character. 
She is really more of a function 
than a person. She does the things 
the plot requires a heroine to do but 
she lacks a distinct and memorable 
personality. This is a common fault 
in books of this type but it is espe- 
cially obvious here where we have 
three of her running around. 

She is supposed to be a genius 
or, at least, very brilliant but as 
with most very brilliant sf scientists, 
her intellectual prowess is uncon- 
vincing. While her accomplishments 
are remarkable, she is never shown 
as reasoning with more than a mod- 
est intelligence. 

Nor is her usefulness to Tweed 
convincing. She has a pathological 
urge to escape. Tweed, who knows 
her subconscious better than she 
does, is aware of this and should 
have realized that this compulsion 
would make her more of a liability 
than an asset. She is too unstable to 
be trusted and yet, in the end, he 
trusts her with the most important 
mission of his career! And, of 



BOOKSHELF 



105 



course, he has reason to regret it. 

With the power to clone anyone 
he chooses, Tweed would have 
been wiser to pick a more docile 
subject than Lilo. But then, Tweed 
is the book’s second biggest mis- 
take. His villainy is central to the 
plot, but he too is never developed 
into more than a function. With one 
exception, he appears only in 
glimpses and he finally vanishes 
completely. What character he has 
is that of a right-wing militarist in- 
tent on destroying godless com- 
munism (or, in this case, the Invad- 
ers). I suspect Varley had some- 
thing like this in mind and con- 
sequently refused to allow himself 
to like Tweed well enough to fully 
realize him. A writer has to like his 
villains to make them believably vil- 
lainous. I could see nothing wrong 
with Tweed’s ambition to re-take 
the Earth. True, it was impossible 
but neither Tweed nor Lilo couW 
know that until they had spoken'To 
the Ophiuchites. His sole villainy 
seemed to be the employment of 
nasty methods — ones that seemed to 
me to be lacking in imagination as 
well as efficiency. He would have 
been wiser to have relied more on 
behavorial modification, less on 
cloning. 

His henchman (-men, -women), 
Vaffa, while menacing enough in a 
street fight and okay for guard duty, 
is no match for Lilo. Like Tweed, 
she is Varley’s idea of a soldier — 
all brawn and no brains. 

Finally, the first half of the novel 



concerns Lilo’s trying to figure out 
what Tweed wants from her and her 
plans to escape. It held my interest. 
At midpoint the plot splits into three 
parts, with one Lilo encountering 
the Invaders and wandering an al- 
most deserted Earth, another Lilo 
still plotting against Poseidon and 
still a third off to discover the 
source of the Ophiuchi Hotline. 
While Varley handles these plot 
lines expertly, it was all a bit much. 

One main plot line is enough to 
make an effective novel. It is the 
surest method of achieving maximum 
reader involvement as well as 
maximum dramatic potential. When 
another plot line of equal or greater 
strength is added, interest is sub- 
tracted from the first one; and the 
more interesting the new tine, the 
greater the diffusion of the overall 
interest. Consequently, the escape 
from Poseidon and Tweed’s war 
against the Invaders become sub- 
plots as do the Invaders themselves, 
and the story winds up being about 
the flight to the Ophiuchi station. 
At least I think so. It is difficult to 
say precisely what the novel is 
about at the end, for Varley re- 
solves nothing. True, it is all in- 
teresting; the book never really bogs 
down but it loses much of the 
power it had to start with. 

This is a common failing in sf 
novels, especially those by our most 
imaginative writers. They cannot re- 
sist just one more dazzling concept 
or mind-boggling plot twist. One 
good idea, thoroughly developed, is 



106 



GALAXY 



worth two piled precariously atop 
one another. 

Despite these failings. The 
Ophiuchi Hotline is still a book I 
would recommend to hard science- 
fiction fans. Its failings are com- 
monplace in even the best sf, and 
despite them, Varley tells a good 
story. He writes well and some of 
his scenes — St. Pete’s Casino on 
Pluto, Lilo’s trek down the Atlantic 
seaboard, her fall into Jupiter — are 
excellent. Lively, colorful and 
imaginative. 1 look forward to his 
next book.

Looney Tombs 

If one of the criteria of fans in 
judging a ghost-story writer is that 
the author’s stories lead them to be- 
lieve that the author himself is as 
crazy as a loon, then Robert 
Aickman is right up there with Poe 
and Lovecraft. There is a consist- 
ency of vision in the eight long 
short stories of his Cold Hand in 
Mine: a depth of insight and an ear- 
nesmess of sentiment toward his 
characters that, as in Poe or Love- 
craft, lead one to think they incorpo- 
rate autobiographical elements. 

The title is the best clue to the 
nature of these stories. Quiet and 
subtle. Chilling but never sensa- 
tional. More puzzling and unsettling 
than horrifying. And in most cases 
one is left wondering if they are 
ghost stories at all and not psychotic 



episodes, the hallucinations of 
haunted men and women who have 
so separated themselves from the 
everyday world that mundane defi- 
nitions of reality no longer apply to 
them. They are lonely, alienated 
people for whom the world was a 
strange place long before they were 
visited by the supernatural. 

And yet, is it the supernatural? 

Where Robert Aickman tran- 
scends the company of Ira Levin or 
Tom Tryon is in that sense of ear- 
nestness he imparts toward the un- 
real, suggesting that he believes in a 
spiritual reality — one that involves 
both good and evil. 

In ‘ ‘The Real Road to the 
Church” a woman who had been 
disappointed once too often in love 
and life retreats to a remote house 
on an island to bury herself and her 
memories, only to find them again, 
literally, on her doorstep in the 
shape of a spectral funeral proces- 
sion. 

Where a Stephen King would 
have played the idea for all its eerie 
worth, Aickman concentrates our at- 
tention on the woman’s feelings. 
The barren, rocky, windswept ter- 
rain is as much a part of her 
psychological ambience as of the is- 
land itself, as is the old house in 
which she lives. So we come not 
only to see her but to feel that we 
have lived in her mind. And we 
find she is not a stranger to us. All 
of Aickman ’s characters have some 
of us in them, that part of us that we 
do not like to think about very of-

ten. That part of us that touches on 
madness. 

She has lived in the old house for 
a long time and seen and heard noth- 
ing of the outside until that morn- 
ing, when she hears her housekeeper 
discussing the legend of the road 
that passes her doorstep. She goes 
for a walk and meets a retired 
cleric, who brings up the subject 
again. She complains she has seen 
nothing. He tells her that is be- 
cause she did not know what to 
look for. She has isolated herself 
in an effort to forget and at the 
same time she wishes only to re- 
member and forgive. Perhaps if she 
were to look the next time, to ask 
the questions she needs to have an- 
swered? But the housekeeper had 
warned her not to look. 

She returns home in a storm, 
soaked and nearly delirious. She 
comes to expect the procession. It 
arrives. She looks, she asks her 
questions. And the answers save her 
life. 

The atmospherics of the classic 
ghost story are there. The trappings. 
The omens, the encounter. Yet 
there is something more that makes 
the story memorable. We cannot be 
sure the woman actually saw the 
procession or had an hallucination; 
or is Aickman trying to tell us that 
there is a spiritual reality co-existent 
with our own? 

Most of Aickman ’s characters are 
guilty of the sin of despair. They 
have separated themselves from the 
world of humanity and dwell in 



shadowlands of their own making. 
Their fate, likewise, is of their own 
making. Or is it? Like everything 
else, we can never be sure and that 
very uncertainty is what Aickman 
wants us to feel. He prefaces his 
book with the quote; “In the end it 
is the mystery that lasts and not the 
explanation.” 

Not all of Aickman’s people are 
so easily categorized but even in the 
case of those who seem to be inno- 
cent victims, we are left 
wondering — and wondering in the 
same way that we often wonder 
about ourselves. 

The subject matter of most of the 
stories is not unusual; a vampire; an 
inn that provides permanent ac- 
commodations for its transient clien- 
tele; an evil yellow dog; a woman 
with a strange affection for clocks. 
In each case the trappings are fa- 
miliar but so subordinated to the 
psychology of the characters and the 
eerie ambience of their minds as to 
seem completely fresh. 

Curiously, the book is a Literary 
Guild selection. I can’t imagine 
why. Fans of the Tryon-King style 
will be disappointed. But for the 
purist, the connoisseur, it will be a 
treasure. 

1 guarantee it will be a collector’s 
item one day. Robert Aickman is, 
in the words of Gahan Wilson, “the 
most terrifyingly intrepid explorer 
of the classical ghost story now liv- 
ing.” 

His name, incidentally, is pro- 
nounced “Ache-man.” ★

GALAXY 



I 






All the world loves a lover. 
But for all time? 



It takes time to adjust to bad 
news. Unfortunately, time was the 
one thing we didn’t have; when we 
finally received a clear medical 
diagnosis, Ana had less than five 
weeks to live and was going down 
fast. Suddenly, after seven inarvel- 
ous years together, with every rea- 
son to look forward to fifty more, 

I saw our future collapse into a 
handful of days. 

For more than a month I had 
known in my heart that there was a 
big problem. Ana’s loss of weight 
and general lassitude were bad 
omens which, together with the 
translucent, waxen look of her 
forehead and the fine blue veins on 
her temples, had warned me of the 
worst. Tom Lambert, our doctor 
and a good personal friend, finally 
told us the grim biopsy results; no 
operation, no treatment worth try- 
ing and a rapidly terminal prog- 
nosis. Tom was a realist — which I 
am not. He prescribed massive 
doses of pain-killers and tranquiliz- 
ers for Ana, and more tranquilizers 
for me. 

“Take as many as you need, 
Drake,’’ he told me. “And don’t 
neglect your own health. I can be 

no 



here any time, night or day, if you 
need me.” 

I flushed my prescription down 
the drain as soon as he had left. I 
had already drained my cup of sor- 
row. There was work to do, and lit- 
tle time to do it; I needed all my 
faculties. Ana and I had always 
done all our thinking together, our 
planning together. Now I had to 
work it out for both of us. It took 
me two frantic weeks to make my 
plans, snatching the time when Ana 
was sleeping or drugged. Then I 
called Tom Lambert and asked him 
to come over. 

He arrived early that evening. It 
was fantastic May weather, with 
spring flowers leaping to blossom 
and bursting life everywhere except 
in the darkened house. After a brief 
examination of Ana, Tom led me 
into the living room and shook his 
head. 

“It’s going faster than I thought, 
Drake. At this rate, Anastasia will 
go into a final coma in a week or 
so. Let me have her taken to a hos- 
pital now. You don’t want to see 
what’s coming. You don’t look as if 
you’ve had a wink of sleep yourself 
for the past month.” 

True, but irrelevant. I sat down 
opposite Tom and told him what 1 
wanted to do, the part I wanted him 
to play. He heard me out, then 
shrugged his shoulders. I could see 
the pitying look in his eyes as he 
agreed to go along with my reque^. 

“If you want to do it, Drake, I’ll 
help you. After all. Ana has nothing 

GALAXY 



to lose. But you know they’ve 
never done a successful thaw and 
revival, even on a healthy test ani- 
mal. I have to tell you that in my 
opinion you’ll be wasting your 
money and Just making this thing 
harder for yourself. What does 
Anastasia say about the idea?’ ’ 

“Not much. She’s willing — 
maybe for my sake. She thinks that 
it won’t work but she agrees that 
she has nothing to lose. Look, bring 
the papers with you tomorrow and 
we’ll sign them. We have to do it 
quickly, while Ana can still hold a 
pen.” 

Eight days later I called Tom 
again. He came to the house, felt 
Ana’s pulse and took blood pressure 
and brain-wave readings. 

“I’m afraid this is it, Drake,” he 
said. “I’ll be very surprised to see 
her regain consciousness. If you’re 
still set on this thing, now’s the best 
time for it, while she still has some 
vestiges of normal body functions. 
A week from now it would be a 
waste of time.” 

I took a last took at Ana’s calm, 
ravaged face. I fought a battle deep 
inside, forcing myself to believe 
that this was not my last farewell to 
her. Then I nodded to Tom. He in- 
jected five c.c.’s of Asfanil to as- 
sure continued unconsciousness. 
Then, working together, we lifted her 
from the bed, removed her clothes 
and laid her gently in the thermal 
tank. While Tom filled out the 
death certificate, I called Second 
Chance and told them to come to 

THE LONG CHANCE 



the house. Tom set the tank at three 
degrees above freezing, inserted the 
needles and began the temperature 
drop. The blood was withdrawn 
through a large hollow needle in the 
main external iliac artery, cooled a 
precise amount and returned to the 
femoral vein. 

In ten minutes Ana’s body temp- 
erature had dropped thirty degrees, 
all life signs had vanished and she 
was dead. Technically and legally, 
Tom Lambert and I were now mur- 
derers. The death certificate showed 
that Ana had died of a cardiac ar- 
rest induced by her main disease — 
impossible to dispute. When the 
Second Chance team arrived, her 
body lay peacefully in the thermal 
tank, maintained precisely at three 
degrees above freezing. 

I had a hard time persuading 
them to let me go over to the Sec- 
ond Chance preparation building 
with Ana’s body. Tom thought I 
just couldn’t face the idea that it 
was all over, and he too urged me 
to accept the fact of her death and 
stay at the house with him. The 
preparation team didn’t know what 
to make of it. I must have seemed 
like a ghoul to them, or some kind 
of necrophiliac. They told me that 
the procedures were not pleasant to 
watch and I would be much better 
off leaving everything to their ex- 
perienced hands. 

Of course I couldn’t tell them 
the real reason why I had to see the 
whole preparation procedure, in de- 
tail. By simply refusing to take no 

ni 



for an answer, I had my way. 

Most Cryo-corpses were stored at 
liquid nitrogen temperatures — about 
minus two hundred degrees Celcius. 

I was not satisfied with that. Minus 
two hundred is still seventy-three 
degrees above absolute zero. Al- 
though all gross biological processes 
become imperceptible long before 
that, there are still plenty of chemi- 
cal reactions going on and the laws 
of statistics guarantee that a few 
atoms will still have enough energy 
for biological changes. Mind and 
memory are very delicate functions. 

I insisted that Ana be prepared and 
stored as a Heli-corpse, at a couple 
of degrees absolute. That way the 
probability of change, physical or 
mental, went way down. The cost, 
naturally, went way up. 

I hung around in the preparation 
room, ignoring all hints that I 
should wait outside, and I watched 
closely. The team finally concluded 
that I must be worried in case they 
messed up the job, so they humored 
me and even answered my 
questions. After the first few min- 
utes it became impossible to see 
what was happening. As soon as all 
the air cavities had been filled and 
all the blood replaced with anti- 
crystalloids, Ana’s body went into 
the pressure chamber. The tempera- 
ture was held at three degrees above 
freezing, while the pressure was 
slowly raised to five thousand at- 
mospheres. Then the temperature- 
drop started. 

Back in the 1960’s and ’70’s the 

112 



freezing process had been done at 
atmospheric pressure, and the for- 
mation of ice crystals ruptured the 
cells as the temperature dropped. 
The thawed results were hardly use- 
ful, even for tissue transplants. The 
modem method makes use of the 
fact that ice can exist in many dif- 
ferent solid forms. If you raise the 
pressure to three thousand atmos- 
pheres, then drop the temperature, 
water will remain liquid to about 
minus twenty degrees Celsius. And 
when it finally changes to a solid, it 
isn’t the familiar form of ice — 
usually called Phase I. Instead, it 
goes to soniething called Phase III. 
Drop the temperature from there, 
holding the pressure constant, and 
at about minus twenty-five degrees 
it goes into another form. Phase 11, 
and stays that way as you drop the 
temperature still further. If you go 
to five thousand atmospheres before 
you drop the temperature, water 
freezes at about minus five degrees 
and goes to yet another form. Phase 
V. The trick to avoid cell-rupture 
problems at freezing point is to in- 
ject anti-crystalloids, which help to 
inhibit crystal formation. Then by 
the right combination of pressure 
and temperature changes, work your 
way down toward absolute zero, 
passing into and through Phases V, 
III and II. 

The process is very tricky and 
there is absolutely nothing to see 
except dial readings. The pressure 
chamber is made without seams or 
observation ports for obvious rea- 

GALAXY 



sons. You don’t get pressures of 
five thousand atmospheres, even in 
the deepest oceans. Fortunately, 
once you have the temperature 
down to a hundred degrees absolute, 
you can let the pressure back down 
to one atmosphere — otherwise Heli- 
and Nitro-corpse storage would be 
impracticable. As it is, there are 
three-quarters of a million of them 
stacked away in the Second Chance 
wombs, all neatly labeled and wait- 
ing the resurrection. As soon as 
someone figures out how. 

In my opinion, it will be as hard 
to re-vivify most of the early Cryo- 
corpses as it would be to get Tut- 
ankhamen’s mummy up and about 
again. They weren’t frozen using 
the correct procedure and they 
were stored at too high a tempera- 
nire. But they paid their depositis 
and they have the right to sit there 
until the rental runs out. I had 
started Ana with a forty-year rental 
but I thought of that as just a be- 
ginning. 

1 had a copy of Ana’s medical 
records with me at the Second 
Chance preparation building. I 
added to them a full description of 
what I had observed in the Heli- 
corpse preparation, copied the 
whole thing, and made sure that a 
complete set was included with the 
file records on Ana that would be 
stored in the wombs. After Ana’s 
body was taken away there, I went 
back to the house, fell into bed and 
slept like a Cryo-corpse myself for 
thirty hours. 

THE LONG CHANCE 



When I was fully awake again, 
fed and bathed, I called Tom Lam- 
bert. It was time to drop the other 
shoe. I went over to his office, ac- 
cepted a hefty drink that Tom pre- 
pared, after one look at me, for 
“medicinal purposes,” and told him 
my plans. 

After I had finished, he came over 
to my chair, poked the muscles in 
my shoulders and the back of my 
neck, pulled down my lower eyelid 
and looked at the exposed skin, 
then went and sat opposite me. 

“You’ve been under a monstrous 
strain the past few months,” he be- 
gan. 

“It would be quite natural 
for your behavior or feelings to 
have been completely normal. In 
fact, you only seem normal even 
now because you’ve walled in your 
emotions. You don’t really under- 
stand the implications of what 
you’re ..suggesting. ” 

I shook my head. “I’ve been 
thinking about this since the first 
day we had your terminal diag- 
nosis.” 

“Then that was the day you put 
the lid on your real feelings. Look, 
Drake, Ana was a wonderful wom- 
an, and I think I have some faint 
idea of what you’ve been through. 
But you must try and look at this 
thing objectively. You can’t let it 
become a complete obsession with 
you. You have a life of your own, 
you must live it.” 

While Tom was talking, I found 
it hard to listen to him. The room 

113 



felt hot and airless and I had trouble 
breathing. His words seemed to 
come to me from a long distance 
and they didn’t penetrate fully. 

“You’re still a young man, 
Drake, with forty or fifty good 
years to look forward to. You are 
one of the word’s leading compos- 
er and your best works lie ahead. 
Ana performed your work better 
than anyone else — but there will be 
others who can learn. With your tal- 
ent, you owe it to the rest of us not 
to cut yourself off in your prime. 

“Drake, take my advice as your 
doctor and your friend. Get out of 
that house and take a vacation. You 
feel one way now, but give it a year 
and then see how you feel. I 
guarantee you things will seem 
quite different. You’ll want to live 
again.” 

The breathless feeling was fading 
and I again had control of myself. 
Tom’s reaction was just what I 
should have expected. I nodded 
agreement. 

“I’ll do as you say, Tom, and 
get away from here for a while. But 
if you’re wrong — if, say, I come 
back to you in eight or ten years 
and ask you again, will you do it? 
Will you help me? I want you to 
give me an honest answer — and 
your word on it.” 

I saw the tension leave him. 
“Ten years from now? Drake, if 
you come back to me in eight or ten 
years. I’ll admit I was wrong — and 
I’ll help you to do what you want. 
That’s a promise. But I’ll bet you 

114 



everything I own that you don’t call ; 
me on that promise. Come on, 
Drake, let’s drink to your future and 
to your next composition.” . 

I shook my head. “Not tonight, 1 
Tom. I really have things to do. For I 
one thing. I’m getting ready to go 
out of town for a while. I’ll be in | 
touch.” 

A half-truth. I wouldn’t leave 
town until my plans were more 
firmly fixed. But I certainly ex- 
pected to be in touch with Tom 
Lambert when the time came. 



I had two problems. One was i 
well-defined: money. I needed 

enough to make sure that Ana’s 
Cryo-corpse would be kept safe into i 
the indefinite future, until she could 
be thawed, her disease cured and 
her life begun again. There were 
some things I obviously couldn’t 
guard against, such as a total col- 
lapse of the world back to bar- 
barism, or the rejection of all pres- 
ent forms of currencies and com- 
modities. Those were risks I had to 
accept. 

The other problem was more sub- 
tle. According to Tom, it would 
probably be a long time — a hundred 
years maybe — before Ana’s un- 
usual and highly malignant disease 
could be cured. Suppose it were 
two hundred years, or even more. 
What knowledge of present-day so- 
ciety would interest people in the 
year 2200, or the year 2300? What 



GALAXY 



should a person be, for the people 
of that future time to think it 
worthwhile to revive him? If we 
had a foolproof way of resuscitating 
the Cryo-corpses, most of the unfor- 
tunates in the Cryo-wombs would 
remain just where they were. Why 
add another to a crowded world, un- 
less he had something special to 
offer? 

I imagined myself back in the 
early nineteenth century. What 
could I have put in my brain, then, 
that would be considered valuable 
two hundred years later? Not poli- 
tics, not art — our knowledge of 
them was quite adequate. Not sci- 
ence, or any technology — we had 
gone far beyond their level. 

I had plenty of time to tackle the 
question — time, which had been de- 
nied to Ana. I could plan and calcu- 
late at my leisure. I had set a goal 
of ten years — that would still give 
us forty of the fifty we had looked 
for and expected. But I was willing 
to stretch that a couple of years, to 
twelve or so, if I had to. My only 
recreation while I planned was to 
estimate the probabilities that it 
would all work out as I hoped. Al- 
ways, the chances came out depres- 
singly low. 

While I pondered my second 
problem, I was hard at work on my 
first one — making money. I turned 
my back on compositions that broke 
new ground. Instead, I took com- 
missions, wrote commemorative 
pieces, gave concerts and made 
recordings — anything was accepted 



if it was lucrative. It was continu- 
ous, grinding toil. If anyone thought 
I was debasing my art, they were 
too polite to comment on it. 

After four years I had my 
biggest stroke of luck and my 
money worries disappeared. I had 
written a set of short pieces a few 
years after Ana and I were married, 
as a kind of musical joke. Baroque 
forms, with baroque period har- 
monies, except for occasional mod- 
em harmonic twists, spice inserted 
where it would be most surprising 
and most appealing. They had been 
quite successful, among a limited 
audience. Then I gave permission 
for them to be used as the incidental 
music for a series of holovision 
dramas on life in eighteenth-century 
France, from Louis Quinze to the 
French Revolution. The dramas 
turned out to be the surprise hit of 
the decade. Suddenly my minuets, 
bourrees, gavottes, sarabandes and 
rondeaux were flooding out of every 
audio outlet, and my royalties were 
flooding in from every country of 
the globe. I established a trust fund 
that would guarantee continued care 
for Ana’s Cryo-corpse for many 
centuries. 

While all this was going on, I 
was feverishly busy soaking up all 
that I could of the personal lives of 
my musical contemporaries. I inter- 
viewed, entertained, courted and 
analyzed them — and I wrote, in 
summary form, of my actions. 
What would the people of the future 
want to know of the present? I was 



THE LONG CHANCE 



115 



betting that it would not be the for- 
mal works, the text-book knowl- 
edge, the official biographies — they 
would have more than enough of 
those. The historians would want to 
hear the personal details, the chat, 
the gossip. They would want the 
equivalent of Boswell’s journals 
and Sam Pepys’ private diary. I was 
careful in my own writings to tantal- 
ize my reader, hinting that I knew far 
more than I was putting into print. 

It took time, but after nine long 
years I felt that I was as ready as I 
would ever be. I hadn’t given as 
much attention as I would have 
liked to the question of earning a 
living in two hundred years’ 
time — but it might be fifty, two 
hundred, or a thousand. Could 
Beethoven, suddenly transported to 
the year 2000, have earned a living 
as a musician? Let me be less 
presumptuous — make that Spohr, or 
Hummel, or some other of Lud- 
wig’s less famous contemporaries. I 
was betting that they could, with 
ease, as soon as they had picked up 
the tricks of the time. If I were 
wrong. I’d do the twenty-third-cen- 
tury equivalent of washing dishes 
for a living. 

I put my affairs in reasonable or- 
der, then went over to see Tom 
Lambert. We hadn’t kept up such 
close contact since Ana had gone. 
I’d had other things on my mind, 
and Tom had married and was busy 
raising a family. He was genuinely 
glad to see me and fussed over me 
like the returning Prodigal Son. We 



settled in the same familiar study 
while Tom beamed at me and his 
wife went to the kitchen and killed 
the fatted calf. 

“I hear your music everywhere, 
Drake,” he said. “It’s great to 
know that your career is going so 
well.” 

It wasn’t, in the strictest musical 
sense. I had done no really first-rate 
composition for many years. But 
Tom had no ear at all for music. 
Perhaps that was the reason that we 
had always got along so well — there 
was no chance of any professional 
jealousy. 

I hated to spoil Tom’s pleasure, 
but the sooner it was done, the bet- 
ter. I took out the application and 
handed it to him without speaking. 

He looked at it and all the happi- 
ness faded from his face. He shook 
his head in disbelief, then looked at 
me closely. 

“Drake, when did you last take a 
vacation?” 

I did not understand his question. 

“When did you last take any sort 
of break from work, Drake? How 
long since you relaxed for an eve- 
ning, or even for an hour?” he 
went on. “I hear that you’ve been 
working incessantly, year after year. 
Face it, Drake. Ana is dead. You 
can’t live forever with your own 
emotions chained and harnessed.” 

The study seemed to be much too 
warm, and I was having trouble in 
catching my breath. I swallowed 
several times and finally pointed at 
the application that Tom was still 



116 



GALAXY 



holding in his hand. 1 still could not 
speak. Tom’s words washed over 
me but 1 could not understand 
them. 

“You’ve done all you can do for 
Anastasia,” he said. “She’s in the 
best womb, she had the best prep- 
aration that you could get. You 
can’t go on with your obsession. 
You’re famous, you’re productive 
— what more do you want? You 
want me to help you to give up all 
this and take the long chance that 
someday, God knows when, they’ll 
find a way to revive you. Drake, 
you’re physically healthy and in the 
prime of life. Don’t you see. I can’t 
help you.” He looked again at the 
application form. “It’s against my 
oath as a physician. I’d be taking 
you from health to a high odds of 
final death. Drake, you need real 
emotional help, more than I can 
give.” 

1 was at last able to force myself 
to speak. 1 said, “You gave me 
your word, Tom.” 

“My word, damn my word. 
You can’t ask this of me.” I said 
nothing and finally he spoke again. 
“Why, Drake? Why would you do 
this?” 

“I have to, Tom.” I spoke 
gently. “You know why, if you 
think about it. Unless I go on 
ahead, they may never wake Ana. 
She may be one of the last on the 
list. You and I know her as she re- 
ally is, but what will her records 
show? A singer, not too famous, 
killed by a devastating disease. You

117 



know they’ll wake the ones they 
nied first. I have to be there. I must 
make sure that they wake Ana as 
soon as they have a certain cure. 
I’ve had the time to prepare, she 
didn’t. I feel pretty sure that they’ll 
wake me.” 

Tom looked blind with misery. 
“Drake, you can’t see reason. 
You’re set on this, aren’t you? If I 
say no, you’ll just go to someone' 
else?” 

I nodded, again without speaking, 
and he put his hands over his face. 
At that moment I knew that I would 
be able to gain his cooperation. 

Five days later Tom Lambert 
had made all the preparations and 
we went together to Second 
Chance. I took a last look out of the 
window at the trees and the sun- 
shine, then climbed slowly into the 
thermal tank. Tom injected the As- 
fanil and after a few seconds I 
began the long fall, dropping 
forever down the longest descent a 
man can ever make. All the way 
down to two degrees absolute, col- 
der than the coldest Hell ever con- 
ceived by Dante. 

* ★ * 

Did I dream my superconducting 
dreams lying there twelve degrees 
colder than a block of solid hydro- 
gen? Or did I only dream that I had 
dreamed them as I came slowly 
slowly back through the long thaw? 
It makes little difference. There was 
an eternity of twisted images, of a 

118 



procession of pale lights moving 
forever on a black background, long 
before I had any form of conscious- 
ness. 

I was one of the lucky ones. The 
freezing process must have gone 
very smoothly, ^d all that I lost 
during the thaw was a few square 
centimeters of skin. But the pain of 
waking — ah, that was something 
else. The slow final stages, up from 
three degrees Celsius to normal 
body temperature, took thirty-six 
hours. For most of that time I was 
pierced with the agony of waking 
tissues and returning circulation, 
unable to move or even to cry out. 
In the last stages, before full con- 
sciousness, hearing came back be- 
fore sight. I could hear speech 
around me, but not in any tongue 
that I could recognize. How far had 
I traveled? As the pain slowly 
faded, that was my first thought. 

I had to wait for the answer. 
While I was still half-conscious, I 
felt the sting of an injector spray, 
and I went out again. Next time, 
though, I came up all the way, 
opening my eyes to a quiet sunlit 
room, not too different from the one 
in the Second Chance building 
where I had started the freeze. 

A man and a woman were watch- 
ing me, talking together softly. As 
soon as they saw that I was fully 
awake, they pressed a point on a 
segmented wall panel and went on 
with their work, lining up two com- 
plex pieces of equipment. 

The man who came in presently 

GALAXY 



through the smooth white sliding 
door was dark-haired and clean- 
shaven, with a smooth, almost 
womanly face. He came to the side 
of the bed and looked at me with a 
pleased and proprietary air. 

“How are you feeling?” It was 
English, oddly pronounced. That 
was reassuring. I’d had two worries 
when I went under, not including 
the obvious one. The first was that I 
would be revived in just a few years’ 
time, when they would be unable to 
do anything at all to help Ana. The 
second, that I’d surface after fifty 
thousand years, a living fossil, un- 
able to communicate my needs to 
the men of the future. 

“I am all right. But weak. Weak 
as a baby.” I thought of trying to 
sit up, then changed my mind. 

“'You are Drake Merlin?” 

“I am.” 

He nodded in satisfaction. “My 
name is Par Leon. You understand 
me easily?” 

“Perfectly easily. Why do you 
ask? When am I?” 

“The old languages are not easy, 
even with much study. In your 
measure, you are in the year 2374 
of the prophet Christ.” 

Three hundred and sixty years. It 
was longer than I had expected. But 
better long than short. I had hated 
and feared the idea of doing it all 
over, again and again, diving to the 
bottom of the Pit and then clawing 
my way back up to thawed life. 

“I have waited here through the 
warming and the treatment,” went 



on Par Leon. “Soon I will leave 
you for rest, more treatment, and 
education. But I wanted to talk with 
you first. I feared a mistake in iden- 
tity, that it might not be Drake Mer- 
lin who was awakened. Also, some 
become insane with the pain of the 
awakening. You are a strong man, 
Drake Merlin. You did not cry out 
or complain at all during your thaw- 
ing.” 

Other things were on my mind. I 
looked across at the two doctors 
who were chatting together in an 
alien tongue as they worked. Could 
they cure Ana? “Language must 
have changed completely,” I said. 
“I cannot understand them at all.” 

“Understand them? The doc- 
tors?” He looked surprised. “Of 
course not. Neither can I. Naturally 
they are speaking Medicine.” 

I raised my eyebrows. The look 
must have survived with its mean- 
ing intact, for he went on. “I speak 
Music and History — and of course, 
Universal. And I learned Old 
Anglic to understand your time and 
speak with you. But no Medicine.” 

“Medicine is a language?” My 
mind was slowed by the long sleep 
and the drugs. 

“Of course. Like Music, or 
Chemistry, or Astronautics. But 
surely this was already true in your 
time. Did you not have languages 
for each — what is the word — 
discipline?” 

“I suppose we did, but we didn’t 
know it.” No wonder I’d found 
educators, psychologists and com- 



THE LONG CHANCE 



119 



puter scientists — to name but a 
few — incomprehensible. The sjiecial 
jargon and acronyms had made 
new languages, more alien than 
classical Greek. “How do you 
speak to the doctors?” 

“For ordinary things, in Univer- 
sal, which all understand. For 
specialized talk, such as our discus- 
sion of you, we keep a computer in 
the circuit to give exact concept 
equivalents in any pair of lan- 
guages.” 

Multi-disciplinary projects must 
be hell. But then they always were. 

I was beginning to feel strangely 
and irrationally euphoric. I pulled 
my strength together and made a de- 
termined effort to sit up. I got my 
head about five centimeters from 
the pillow,' then fell back. 

“Slowly. Rome — was not 
built-in a day.” Par Leon was 
clearly delighted at coming up with 
such a prize piece of genuine Old 
Anglic. “It will be moons before 
■ you are fully strong. Two more 
things I will tell you, then I will let 
your treatment go on. 

“First, it was I who arranged for 
you to be brought here and revived. 

I am a musicologist, interested in 
the twentieth and twenty-first cen- 
turies, particularly in your own 
time.” 

One of my bets of long ago had 
paid off. I wondered what modem 
music would be like. Could I learn 
to compose it? 

“Under our law,” went on Par 
Leon, “you owe me for the cost of 

120 



revival and treatment. That is six 
years’ work from you. You are for- 
tunate that you were healthy and 
properly frozen, or that time would 
have been much longer. I think you 
will find your work with me pleas- 
ant and interesting. Together we 
will write the definitive history of 
your own musical period.” 

It looked as though it would be a 
while before I needed to worry 
about earning my own living— 
presumably Par Leon would feed 
me while I was paying off my debt. 

“Second, there is good news for 
you.” 

Par Leon was looking at me 
expectantly. “When we woke you, 
the doctors found certain problems 
— defects? — with your body and 
your gladular balance. They hope 
they have cured these. You should 
now live between one hundred and 
seventy and two hundred years. 

“The gland adjustment was more 
subtle. You showed some madness, 
an uncontrollable compulsion, a 
fixed idea about a woman. The doc- 
tors observed this as soon as you 
were thawed enough to respond to 
the psycho-probes. They have made 
small chemical changes and have, 
they hope, corrected the problem. 
What are your feelings now about 
the woman. Ana?” 

He was watching me closely. My 
heart was racing and I felt as 
though there were weights on ray 
chest. I closed my eyes and thought 
about Ana for a long moment, until 
I was calm again. When I opened 

GALAXV 



my eyes again, I looked at Par Leon 
and shook my head feebly. “There 
is nothing. Just the faint feeling that 
something once was there. Like the 
scar of an old wound.” 

“Excellent.” He smiled and nod- 
ded. “That is most satisfying. The 
disease she had was eliminated from 
us long ago by mating choice — 
eugenics, that is your word for it? 
The doctors say they could revive 
her but they are not sure they could 
make a cure. It is important that 
thoughts of her should not interfere 
with your work for me.” 

“Her body is still stored?” 

“Of course. We keep all the 
Cryo-corpses for possible future 
use. They are like a library of the 
past, to open when they will serve a 
purpose. Who knows? Two hundred 
years from now her disease may be 
cured and if there is a need for her, 
she too will live and work again.” 
“She is near here?” 

“Of course not. What an idea!” 
Par Leon was shocked. “We cannot 
afford the space on Earth. The 
Cryo-corpse banks are kept on 
Pluto, where space is cheap and 
cooling needs are small.” 

That sentence, more than any 
other he had spoken, wrenched me 
into the future. What technology 
was it that found it more expedient 
to ship a few million bodies to 
Pluto rather than keep them in cold 
storage on Earth? Three hundred 
and sixty years was the time from 
Copernicus to Einstein, from Mon- 
teverdi to Schoenberg, from the first 

THE LONG CHANCE 



successful American colony to the 
first landing on the Moon. I had 
come a long way. 

Par Leon was still looking at me, 
a little anxiously. “You ask again 
about the woman. Are you sure that 
you are all right — that you are 
cured?” 

I cursed my own stupidity. I did 
my best to smile reassuringly. 
“Don’t worry. As soon as I am 
strong enough, we will begin our 
work.” 

He nodded. “After you have had 
training — that is essential. You must 
learn to speak Universal and Music 
and know enough to live in this 
time. It is my responsibility to see 
that you find activity when your 
work for me is finished. Rest now. 
I will come again tomorrow or the 
next day, when you will be a little 
stronger.” 

As Par Leon left, the doctors 
brought a piece of padded head-gear 
and placed it on me. I went out at 
once, with no time to react to its 
presence. 

When I awoke again, I already 
had a smattering of Universal and a 
good elementary knowledge of the 
civilization of the year 2374. Now I 
understood Par Leon’s confidence 
that 1 would quickly pick up the 
knowledge that I would need to 
work with him. 

Facts, vocabulary and rules could 
be taught almost instantaneously. 
Use of language came more slowly. 
After a couple of weeks I decided 
that two aspects of the times would 



121 



be forever beyond me: modem sci- 
ence and the morality that gov- 
erned the age. It was no surprise 
that I would find science difficult. 
In my own time teachers had re- 
garded me as hopeless as I strug- 
gled with Feynman diagrams and 
was baffled completely by axioma- 
tic field theory. But morals? Surely 
they should be comprehensible? I 
comforted myself with the thought 
that Henry the Eighth would have 
been appalled at the idea of killing 
civilians in time of war' and baffled 
by my revulsion at the idea of pub- 
lic executions. 

After a month of preparation Par 
Leon and I were able to begin our 
work. I would keep my part of the 
bargain and give him six good, long 
years for his great lifetime project, 
the analysis of the musical trends of 
the late twentieth and early twenty- 
first centuries. More important than 
any facts were the perspectives I 
could offer him. He found it hard to 
believe how much man-woman and 
man-man relationships had affected 
everything in my era. With modem 
methods of mating dictated by 
selection of desirable gene combina- 
tions, he found it almost unthinka- 
ble that people should have mated 
randomly, on impulse. He was fas- 
cinated by my comments. It was a 
little irritating to him that I had be- 
come a Cryo-corpse Just before a 
couple of events that he was espe- 
cially interested in had happened, 
but he accepted that philosophically 
and with good humor. 

122 



While we worked, I learned more 
about the times. The Solar System 
was explored, known like the back 
of a man’s hand. Venus had been 
terra-formed. Mars colonized, and 
there were permanent manned 
stations — some ‘manned’ by organic 
computers — on all the major satel- 
lites of the outer planets mid on 
Pluto. Space drives were available 
that would get as close to the speed 
of light as you wanted — but few 
people were interested. The stars 
were within easy reach, but no one 
seemed to 'be stretching out his 
hands. Civilization seemed changed, 
content with the limits of the Solar 
System. I took hypno-courses in as- 
tronautics and space systems and 
became expert in the practice of 
drive mechanisms. The theory, 1 
suspected, was forever beyond me. 

Work went on. I shouldn’t give 
the impression that with Par Leon it 
was a one-way transfer of informa- 
tion. From his vantage point three 
hundred and sixty years away, he 
had developed insights into what 
was really happening in the musical 
world of my earlier life that left me 
gasping. So that was where those 
musicd forms were leading, and 
that’s where Krubak had been aim- 
ing in his much-ridiculed late 
works! Something — perhaps the 
glandular adjustments that the doc- 
tors had performed on me— made 
working with Par Leon a pleasant 
experience. Previously I had al- 
ways been something of a toner. To 
say that I was perfectly content 

GALAXY 



yvould of course be wrong, but 
given my preoccupations, I was 
iflote content than I would have im- 
I agined- 

{ The text we were producing 
! steadily grew. By the beginning of 
l(),e fourth year, I knew we were 
' svriting a classic together. During 
j [lie sixth year we were nearing 
completion and Par Leon was 
juggesting the possibility of other 
collaborations. 

After the work was finally com- 
plete, Par Leon — a good man by 
I jny moral standards I would ever be 
I able to comprehend — helped me to 
; become established as a composer. 

I It was easier than I expected. 

I Knowledge of the centuries before 
Cryo-corpses was quite spotty, with 
some big gaps. I could steal tricks 
from the musical titans of my own 
past, use them in the modem style, 
and get away with it. After three 
years I had a growing reputation 
(which I secretly knew was unde- 
served), a group of imitators, 
and— most important — a substantial 
financial credit at my disposal. 

At last I could wait no longer. I 
announced that it was time for me 
to take a long-overdue vacation and 
see a little more of the Solar Sys- 
tem. The night before I left I took 
Par Leon out for dinner. We went 
10 his favorite place, ate his favorite 
foods, and drank his favorite- wines. 
Even though I suspected that if I 
told him the truth he would be my 
willing accomplice, I did not tell 
him what we were celebrating or 

the long chance 



why the occasion was so very sp>e- 
cial. My plans might involve danger 
and destruction and I did not want 
Par Leon to bear any blame when I 
was gone. 

★ ★ ★ 

So there we were. Ana and I, to- 
gether again. We were heading for 
Canopus in the space yacht that I 
had rented for a two-month tour of 
the inner Solar System. Murderer in 
one era, I was now thief and worse 
in another. Even with forged papers 
to help me, it had been a desperate 
and violent mn through the Pluto 
wombs and the Solar security 
perimeter with Ana’s Cryo-corpse. 
Twice I had been within seconds of 
collision and destruction, but my 
pursuers’ fear of death had ex- 
ceeded mine. They had changed 
course to avoid impact and I had 
fled through their net. 

We were traveling at just one 
hundred and twenty-five meters a 
second below the speed of light 
and could get within a meter a sec- 
ond if I chose to. We were moving 
fast enough. Time dilatation made 
three years pass on Earth for every 
day of shipboard time. The trip to 
Canopus and back would be a little 
more than two months for us, and 
two hundred years back on Earth. I 
felt I could use the time to relax a 
little. The days before I collected 
Ana from the Pluto wombs, fol- 
lowed by our escape, had been 
more than hectic. 

123 



I never ceased to be amazed at 
the capacities of the ship — which, 
because of time dilation, mankind 
seemed to have found no real use 
for. The mass indicator showed 
more than one hundred and forty 
thousand tons, up from a rest mass 
of a hundred and thirty tons. 

To an outside observer I would 
appear to mass about eighty-eight 
tons and be foreshortened to a 
length of less than two millimeters. 
Although it was hidden from me by 
the shields, I knew that ahead of us 
in the forward direction the three- 
degree background radiation left 
over from the Big Bang had been 
Dopplershifted up to visible 
wavelengths. Behind us, hard X-ray 
sources looked like pale red stars. 
And we were nowhere near the 
ship’s limits. 

I had started composing again — 
real music, not pot-boilers or de- 
rivative works. In the room aft. Ana 
lay peacefully in her Cryo-tank. I 
felt optimistic that two hundred 
years would be long enough for 
Earth to have developed a complete 
and certain cure. If not, we would 
head out again and repeat the cycle. 
There was plenty of time. If Earth 
could not at last provide our an- 
swer, we could go elsewhere, on to 
the stars to search for other solu- 
tions. The ship was completely 
self-sustaining and had ample power 
for many lifetimes. I hoped that the 
single trip would be enough, 
though; one of my ambitions on our 
return was to find the Cryo-corpse 

124 



of my friend Par Leon, and retum 
his favor to me. 

As we swept up to the great flar- 
ing beacon of Canopus, I deceler. i 
ated to gravitational swing-by j 
speeds and let the ship fall througb 
a tight hyperbolic orbit around the 
star. Canopus was a fearsome sight. 
More than a thousand times as ! 
luminous as the Sun, it was spout- ! 
ing green flares of gas hundreds of 1 
millions of kilometers long. i i 
searched for planets and found only 
four gas-giants, each the size of Ju. 
piter. There were no signs of an 
inner-planet system. j 

After two days of fascinated ob- 
servation I turned the ship and 
headed back to Earth. Were mine I 
the first human eyes to see the ! 
twisting striations — sun-scars, not 
sun-spots — that gouged the boiling 
surface of Canopus? Like a lost soul 
flying from Hell-gate, I ran for the 
shelter of our own Solar System. If 
another trip out were necessary, h 
would be to a smaller and less tur- 
bulent star. 

That sight of Hell had affected 
me more than anything I could re- 
member. It burned in my mind and 
I could not eat, drink or sleep. The 
urge to see Ana again, to seek 
peace in her face, grew on me and 
at last I went aft. She lay in her 
tank like a Snow-goddess, with j 
pearly eyelids and skin of milky 
crystal. I took only one quick look, 
afraid to open the tank more in case 
it interfered with the cooling sys- 
tem. It was enough. I could conttd 

GALAXY 



myself again and think of other 
things. 

On the tranquil return trip, I 
wondered again at how easy every- 
thing had seemed. I had never 
thought of light-speed ships and 
time dilation when I was making 
my plans so long ago. At best, I 
had prepared for a chancy succes- 
sion of freezings and thawings for 
me, further and further in time until 
at last there was a cure and Ana 
could safely be revived. As it was. 
Ana was with me; I could safeguard 
her myself and there was no risk at 
all. 

In we came, past the barren out- 
croppings of Pluto and on to the 
inner planets. With no idea how 
Earth would have changed in two 
hundred years, I had no way to de- 
cide whether I should approach 
slowly and cautiously or rapidly 
and confidently. My decision was 
made for me. As we rode in above 
the ecliptic, avoiding the asteroid 
belt, we were locked by a naviga- 
tion and guidance beam and steered 
to a landing on the Moon. 

The spaceport was new, massive 
colunms set in a regular triangular 
anay. Spaceflight at least had 
changed since we left. The guidance 
system set us down gently. Prepared 
for anything — or so I thought — I 
stepped through the lock to meet a 
new generation. 

One man greeted me in the lock 
corridor, a tall dignified figure with 
the distant eyes of a prophet. 
Somehow I had expected more, 

THE LONG CHANCE 



perhaps a show of weapons until 
my identity was known. 

“Welcome again to Earth-space, 
Drake Merlin.” 

The language was still Universal. 
I said I was prepared for any- 
thing — but I was not prepared to 
be recognized and named. I was 
taken aback, then I realized that the 
ship’s identification was given in 
the communication codes, and I 
would be shown as the last pilot. 
The data retrieval presumably still 
held those records. I wondered what 
else the system showed about my 
wild flight from Pluto. 

“Since you know my identity, 
then perhaps you also know my his- 
tory. I am seeking assistance.” 

The man nodded. “We know 
your history, and your quest. It has 
come down to us from ancient 
times. One version holds that you 
lost control of your ship and were 
carried off to the far depths of 
space. Another tells that your dis- 
appearance at light-speed was inten- 
tional. Come with me, we will find 
conversation easier inside the city.” 
There were small pauses in his 
words, almost as though he had 
need to stop and think about many 
phrases. 1 wondered if Universal 
was a learned language to him, as 
Old Anglic had been to Par Leon. 
We settled into a reception room, 
close by the inner lock, and I felt a 
rising tension. In a few moments I 
would know if my search was over. 

“The Cryo-corpse that you have 
with you in the ship. What was the 

125 



disease?’ ’ 

“I think there is no word for it in 
Universal. It disappeared from the 
race and from the language. The 
full medical description was given 
with the womb records.” 

He nodded. ‘‘Do you have the 
womb catalog number?” 

I gave it to him. He stood mo- 
tionless, eyes distant, for almost 
five seconds. Then he nodded 
again. ‘‘It can be cured. I have 
summoned the necessary medical 
resources.” 

Two waves of emotion swept 
over me. Wild joy, and an almost 
superstitious fear. Telepathy seemed 
to have been added to the human 
senses. 

‘ ‘ You can transmit your thoughts?’ ’ 
I asked. 

He looked puzzled, and again 
there was a brief silence. Then he 
smiled. 

‘‘Not in the way that you are 
thinking. I can exchange thoughts 
with others, and with the data 
banks, but you will be able to do 
the same in a few days’ time. You 
will also be able to compute faster 
and better than the computer of the 
ship that brought you here. Look.” 

He turned his head to me and 
raised the gray hair above his left 
temple. There was a faint, straight 
scar there. 

“That is the place where the im- 
plant is made. There is no reason 
this could not have been done in the 
time in which you first lived. A 
small set of integrated circuits han- 

126 



dies calculations — we think in the 
numbers, just as in your day you 
did it through finger-pressure on 
keys. 

“The implant is fully program, 
mable. It also contains a signal 
transmitter and receiver, so that we 
can enter data and programs directly 
from the central computers, or from 
another person. I am speaking to 
you now in Universal by using the 
translation programs on the Tycho 
computer system.” 

He caught my look of misgiving, I 
“Do not worry about this. I assure 
you that in a few months you will 
find it hard to believe that you 
functioned without such a service. 
You will have total recall, be a cal- 
culator beyond the most skillful of 
your time, and you will have im- 
mediate access to all the data of the 
Solar System— though the trans- 
mission time is considerable for the 
data banks of other planets. 

“Now, let me query the medical 
team. They should have made their 
first examination of the Cryo-corpse 
in your ship.” 

He was again silent for a few 
seconds. Then his eyes widened 
and he looked at me with a different 
expression. The silence continued. 1 
felt again a knife of tension twisting 
inside me, a feeling that something 
was going wrong. 

“What is it?” I said at last. 
“Have you been in communication 
with your medical team? What do 
they say?” 

He nodded. His eyes now seemed 
GALAXY 




different, gentler and closer. He ap- 
peared to be choosing his words 
with great care. 

“The woman in the Cryo-tank. 
Anastasia. When you took her from 
the wombs of Pluto, was the Cryo- 
tank fully sealed?” 

I could not speak and my mind 
was filled with foreboding. I in- 
clined my head a fraction of an 
inch. 

“But you opened the tank? After 
you had left Pluto?” he asked 
gently. 

“(^ce. To see her, after we left 
Canopus. I looked for only a mo- 
ment, and I sealed the tank again 
afterward.” 

I could not tell him that I had 
been unable to stop myself, I had 

THE LONG CHANCE 



been driven. Suddenly I was look- 
ing at him across a gulf of five 
hundred and seventy years. His sad 
face was Tom Lambert’s, and Par 
Leon’s also. His eyes were speaking 
the same message. 

“Drake Merlin, the Cryo-tank 
was intended only for storage in the 
wombs. After it was opened, the 
seal was imperfect. You understand 
what I am saying? Without the cor- 
rect seal, the temperature in the 
tank was too high.” 

He seemed unable to speak for a 
few moments, and I assume that he 
was calling for more data from his 
computer banks. Then he continued. 
“I have checked with the medical 
team and with the best data 
sources. The damage caused to the 



127 




body when the tank was opened and 
the seal broken cannot be repaired. 
There can be no revival, now or 
ever. 

“i am sorry, Drake Merlin. 
Anastasia is dead. Forever dead.” 

Forever dead. Forever dead. The 
words seemed to echo Tom Lam- 
bert, from long ago. This time 
there was the ring of complete cer- 
tainty. For each man kills the thing 
he loves. I had taken the long 
chance, and now it was over. 

There was a long period of intro- 
spection, twenty billion nano- 
seconds of communion with the 
data banks and the medical teams.' 
As my world collapsed, the barriers 
came down inside my mind. I 
noticed for the first time the faint 
spicy sweetness of the air freshen- 
ers, the steady dry breeze blowing 
past us, and the faint concert pitch 
A-natural of vibrating metal far 
along the corridor. My senses were 
opening again, after long centuries 
of hibernation. 

At last he spoke again. “One 
possibility remains. Anastasia, the 
woman you knew, cannot be re- 
animated. Whole cells remain and 
she can be cloned without diffi- 
culty, but growth and education 
would begin anew. There is no 
hope of sufficient memory transfer 
from undamaged cells for more than 
a faint inkling of her former self to 
pass to her new body. Your former 
close relationship would be irrelev- 
ant to her. Should we proceed?’ ’ 

I wanted to say yes, but caution 



held me. “Why would you do this 
for us? What will the price be, to 
me or to her?” 

Shrugged shoulders had retained 
a meaning, although I could not see 
how such information would be 
transferred through a communica- 
tion implant. 

“You would be deprived of an 
implant and you would not share 
our group-consciousness. Call it an 
experiment. The group-mind has 
become curious about the behavior 
of single units such as you, not 
connected through the implants. 
Also, we have a feeling that in the 
old emotional patterns can only be 
called sympathy. Your suffering is 
unique. No quest comparable with 
yours is recorded in the data banks, 
unless it is the fragmented and con- 
fusing description of Orpheus and 
Eurydice. 

“Shall we proceed?” 

Only one answer was possible. 
“Proceed.”

Sorry, you’ll have to provide 
your own scorecard for 
this! 



This,” said the Director, “is 
the control panel of a time machine. 
Or rather, it is a non-functioning 
mock-up of the control panel of a 
time machine. It will transport you 
back into the past when you take on 
this assignment, Howard. Do you 
wish to inspect it?” 

Howard Bradley stood up and ac- 
cepted the proffered panel, then sat 
down and propped it on his knee to 
inspect it. It was about three feet by 
two feet, made of light plastic 
sheeting and studded with a large 
number of small buttons and three 
bigger ones below. The instructions 
were in both English and the equiv- 
alent Russian, Bradley noted; 
‘SEND,’ ‘OPEN’ and ‘CLOSE’ on 
the three big buttons; seconds, 0 to 
59; minutes, 0 to 59; hours, 0 to 
23; days, 1 to 31; months, January 
through December; and years, 1977 
and 1978. 

“Hmm.” Bradley scratched his 
head with his right hand. “There 
seem to be only two year numbers, 
sir, this year and last. Doesn’t it go 
any further than that?” 

The Director leaned back and 
smiled. “No, Howard, apparently 
not. According to the inventor, it 



can’t go back any earlier than when 
he originally invented it, and it 
can’t go forward any further than 
it’s been of its own accord through 
time.” 

“So what happens in 1979, sir?” 
“Oh, we can add buttons easily 
enough. The digital mechanism in 
the control panel is easy enough to 
understand, just the standard kind of 
thing you’d find in an electronic 
calculator. The guts of it though, 
the motor, really had us baffled.” 
“Had you baffled, sir? You mean 
we now understand it?” 

The Director smiled ruefully, 
shaking his head. “No, Howard, 
no. I don’t think the Russians can 
understand it either, and they have 
the only working model. Or had it 
until recently, that is. We have, er, 
connections over in Moscow, and 
from all accounts they were going 
batty trying to figure it out. Didn’t 
want to destroy the working parts 
by tampering with them too hard, 
exactly the same problem we had.” 
Bradley sat back in his chair, bit- 
ing his lower lip as he tried to con- 
centrate. “Ah, let’s see, sir. Why 
don’t you fill me in a little more 
fully on this. This is, presumably,” 
and he lifted up the panel, putting it 
tidily leaning against the left 4eg of 
his chair, “the same time machine 
that was invented last year by Doc- 
tor Helmut Heinrich of Switzerland. 
The one that the Russians paid a 
billion dollars for, right?” 

“A billion dollars and a million, 
dammit.” The Director scowled 



130 



GAIAXY 



darkly. “Those damn Russians 
knew our bidding, limit, they knew 
we’d have to go to Congress for 
anything higher. And the inventor 
didn’t want to wait, naturally.” 
Bradley shook his head sym- 
pathetically. “Ah, sir. The weak- 
nesses of democracy.” There was 
silence for a few moments. 

“Well, sir,” Bradley continued 
after a while. “So the Russians 
have the only time machine, right?” 
“Well, sort of.” The Director 
knitted his brows as if puzzled 
about exactly how to continue. 
“Here, Howard, why don’t you 
come along to the Research Lab? 
I’ll show you a mock-up of the 
whole thing.” He got up and left 
the office at a brisk walk, with 
Bradley following behind. “Now, 
Howard,” he continued, “the thing 
folds up. Like a folding table. It is 
very important that you practice to 
get it right. Your life may depend 
on it.” 

“Folds up, sir?” Bradley asked. 
They reached the big door of the 
Research Lab, the Director nodded 
to the guard and they passed 
through. 

“Yes, folds up,” the Director re- 
plied. “That way you can put one 
time machine inside another one, to 
transport it.” They turned right 
along a corridor. 

“Er, sir?” Bradley queried. “I 
thought there was only one time 
machine?” 

“Well, we think they are all the 
same one.” The Director shrugged. 

THE TIMELESS SPY 



“Here,” he opened a door on the 
left. “There’s our mock-up.” 

“That thing? The one that looks 
like an elevator cage?” Bradley 
gazed curiously at it, walking 
slowly all round it. A big cubical 
structure, eight feet tall, mounted 
on casters, with a glass window at 
the front and sliding doors, nothing 
particular around the back, and 
five buttons on the right, marked 
‘OPEN,’ ‘CLOSE,’ ‘SEND,’ 
’FOLD’ and ‘LOCK,’ with the 
same words in Russian. Inside, 
through the window, there appeared 
to be a panel like the one he had 
seen earlier. “Can I press the but- 
tons, sir?” 

“Certainly. Oh, the ‘send’ button 
does not work, of course. Be very 
careful not to press it when you are 
with the real model.” 

Bradley nodded and pressed but- 
tons, ‘open’ — the door opened. 
‘close’ — the door closed, ‘fold’ — 
nothing happened. 

“It has to be open to fold up, 
Howard.” 

“Er, yes.” Bradley pushed but- 
tons again. ‘open’ — the door 
opened, ‘fold’ — nothing happened. 

“Good, Howard.” The Director 
stepped inside and folded the roof 
down against the back, then walked 
around the outside, pushing down 
the left side, the back and the right 
side. It took a considerable muscu- 
lar effort, Bradley noticed, but the 
hinges hardly made any noise. The 
finished product was a squat box, 
about seven by seven by two feet; 

J31 



part of the base, he noted, had also 
folded up. 

The Director stood back, rubbing 
his hands. “Ok, Howard. Your 
turn. Unfold it; push in the lock 
button; fold it.” 

Bradley wrinkled his nose in dis- 
taste. This looked a little too much 
like hard work. Shrugging his 
shoulders, he moved in, pushed the 
sides back in reverse order, and 
pushed the ‘LOCK’ button. Then 
the ‘FOLD’ button, and the sides 
again. He sank down in a nearby 
chair. 

“Right first time, Howard.” The 
Director smiled. “Now, push it 
over the floor on its casters and lift 
it up into the other time-machine 
mock-up over there.” 

Bradley scowled, pushed it over 
the floor and started heaving it up. 
One caster, up, and along. Second 
caster, up, push. Third caster up, 
and the fourth, and sli-i-ide it in. 
He sat down on it, perspiring heav- 
ily. 

“Ok, Howard.” The Director 
sounded infernally cheerful. “Now, 
climb in on top of it and press the 
buttons to close the door.” 

Bradley wearily complied. Clam- 
ber up; bend down; ‘close;’ ‘open.’ 
The doors worked. He sat down on 
the edge again, frowning. 

The Director smiled broadly. 
“Now, Howard, we could, theoreti- 
cally, put a third time machine in- 
side—” 

“Oh no you couldn’t,” Bradley 
interrupted. “You don’t need a spy, 

132 



you need a professional weightlifter. 

I don’t think these things were de- 
signed to be stacked inside each 
other. I don’t think I could even 
reach the buttons if there were 
another one inside.” 

The Director shrugged cheerfully. 
“Of course they weren’t designed to 
go inside each other. They were de- 
signed to fold up so they’d go into 
a truck or a plane. The time 
machine doesn’t actually go any- 
where, it just goes backward and 
forward in time, in the same 
spot.” 

Bradley scowled. “Not very use- 
ful, is it? The Russians can have it, 
as far as I’m concerned.” He got 
off and walked over to settle into a 
nearby armchair. “Well, what now, 
sir?” 

The Director smiled again and sat 
down in another chair, crossing his 
legs at the ankle. “Your mission, 
Howard, should you choose to 
undertake it, will be to go back in 
time, report to duty here at Head- 
quarters, explain your mission to 
me, and then proceed to deliver 
back here a time machine which 
you will then proceed to steal from 
the Russians, after we fly you to 
Zurich to the hotel where the inven- 
tor stayed previously while he was 
conducting his bargaining. You will 
also, if possible, attempt to find out 
from the inventor what the secret is 
for his machine, so we can make 
another one after you get back. 
Ok?” 

Bradley sat back in his' chair, his 

GALAXY 



brows furrowed in thought, scratch- 
ing his ear with his left hand. The 
seconds ticked by silently. 

“Er, Howard,” the Director in- 
terrupted the silence. “Do you un- 
derstand your mission?” 

“Er, no, sir. Not at all. Er, sir, 
this mission sounds rather, er, 
dangerous. Would you mind very 
much if someone else went on this 
one? After all, sir, I have just re- 
turned from another mission that 1 
was on for the last four months.” 
Bradley watched uneasily as the 
Director’s face grew red and angry. 
“No, no, Howard!” The Director 
pounded his fist in the air. “You’ve 
got to go back, because you already 
didl If you don’t go back now, 
you’ll ruin everything. We couldn’t 
possibly send someone else!” 

“Oh yes we could, sir. The other 
agent could steal the time machine 
instead of me, and — ” 

“No, no, no! Howard, you al- 
ready reported back to me and ex- 
plained the entire mission to me 
just two months ago. If we sent 
someone else back, it’d be silly. 
You can’t possibly not go. You al- 
ready have!” 

“Oh no I haven’t, sir.” Bradley 
shook his head vigorously. “I was 
out on my previous assignment two 
months ago. If someone else re- 
ported to you back then saying he 
was me, he must obviously have 
been an imposter. The Russians, 
you see, could — ” 

“No, Howard, no! That’s exactly 
what I thought when you first re- 



ported in here. I was extremely 
sceptical. But we checked you out 
very thoroughly, and — ” 

“Sir, 1 was no/ here two months 
ago. And this mission is not only 
dangerous, it’s preposterous! There’s 
no way you can make me go. It 
says here in the Professional Es- 
pionage Agents’ Contract, Section 
14—” 

"'Damn the stupid contract! You 
already signed, dammit. Or you will 
sign as soon as you get back here 
from the mission, before we send 
you off on it. You told me so dis- 
tinctly, just two months ago. In fact, 
we had you sign the permission 
form again back then, just to be on 
the safe side.” 

Bradley put his head down and 
cradled it between his hands, moan- 
ing softly for a few moments. Then 
he pushed himself back in his chair, 
grasped both arms of it firmly and 
looked the Director in the eye. 

“Ok, sir, let’s try this again from 
the beginning. Two months ago a 
man walked into your office who 
resembled me and claimed to be 
me. Right?” 

“Right.” 

“He told you a story about time 
travel and initially you did not be- 
lieve him, right?” 

“Right.” 

“And he managed to convince 
you that he was telling the truth, 
right? Ok, how?” 

“We dosed him with sodium pen- 
tazoanate, of course.” 

“The truth drug, sir? Sir, that’s 



THE TIMELESS SPY 



133 



extremely dangerous stuff. Why, if 
you’d given him only one and a 
half times too much, you could’ve 
killed him — or killed me, that is, 
maybe.” 

“Oh no, we were careful, How- 
ard, don’t worry. Just exactly the 
right dosage. Lie detectors, too, ev- 
erything else we could think of. It 
was you, Howard. Besides, we had 
his time machine, too.” 

“Er, yes.” Bradley leaned back 
and scratched his head again. 
“Then I presume you were able to 
take it apart and analyze its func- 
tions, and hence you no longer 
need — ” 

“Er, no, Howard.” The Director 
shrugged perplexedly. “You told us 
we wouldn’t be able to figure it out, 
and unfortunately you were right. 
We didn’t want to break anything 
vital in it, so we couldn’t get too 
deeply into it. After all, you need it 
some more, so as to be able to try 
to steal the secret of it from the 
original inventor and to report back 
here to start your mission.” 

“Er, let’s not get started on that 
again.” Howard frowned in con- 
centration. “Ok, so he, or I, told 
you a story, and you checked it out 
under truth serum, and then you 
sent him off on the rest of his mis- 
sion. Ok, then what did he tell 
you?” 

The Director shrugged. “Basi- 
cally, Howard, exactly what I am 
telling you now. Naturally. Plus, he 
was met at this Headquarters, this 
morning, later, by his alter ego re- 



turning safely from the mission, and 
got onto the second time machine, 
himself and pressed the right but- 
tons for two months ago and ar- 
rived here in Headquarters. In the 
Research Lab, of course. They were 
very surprised to see you.” 

“Er, yes, sir.” Bradley frowned 
in concentration. “Hmm. Do you 
have any tapes, sir, of conversation 
with this, er, person?” 

The Director smiled and glanced 
at his watch. “Yes, we have just 
enough time for that before you 
arrive back. Right back at my 
office, Howard.” 

“Yes,” Howard Bradley thought 
as the tape recorder started up. 
“That’s me all right.” He listened 
on as his voice detailed the plan he 
had just heard, interrupted from 
time to time by the voice of the Di- 
rector raising objections. The Direc- 
tor, back in his seat, glanced at his 
watch from time to time, tapping 
his foot nervously against the desk 
edge. The phone rang and the Di- 
rector cut off the recording before 
its end. 

“Yes?” The Director frowned in- 
tently as he listened to the caller. 
“More Russians? Good. Did they 
bring it with them?” He listened in- 
tently some more. “Good. That’s 
exactly what we expected. Are all 
the original group still there?” 
More listening. “Ok, keep in touch 
with me about what happens. Bye.” 
The Director returned the phone 
to its cradle and turned to face 
Bradley again. “Ok, Howard, lis-

ten carefully. The Russians are in 
Zurich at the same hotel where the 
inventor stayed three months ago, in 
the same suite of rooms. They 
moved in yesterday. Today an air- 
freight shipment arrived there and 
they brought it into the hotel. It 
only just fit through the doors, the 
same dimensions as the time 
machine when it’s folded up. Ok? 
We have them under surveillance, 
though they removed the bugs that 
we put into that room two months 
ago so we don’t know exactly what 
they’re doing. We suspect that they 
are planning to send back that time 
machine to the time that the inven- 
tor was there negotiating, maybe to 
steal his blueprints, Ok? Just de- 
duction, not firm knowledge. In their 
group they have Pavel Yurovich, 
the truth-drug expert, and Ivan 
Ivanovich.” 

“Ivan Ivanovich?” Bradley leaned 
forward attentively. “Their top 
spy?” 

“Yes, indeed.” The Director 
smiled. “That Ivanovich. Fluent in 
six languages and a master of dis- 
guise. We didn’t recognize him, of 
course, but we got voiceprints as he 
went through Swiss Customs.” 

The Director glanced at his watch 
again. “Ok, Howard, time to go.” 
He stood up, rewound the tape re- 
corder on fast rewind, took out the 
tape reel, then took out another tape 
reel from another recorder below his 
desk, added a large manila en- 
velope and handed them curtly to 
Bradley. 



“All right, Howard, follow me,” 
he commanded, heading back to the 
Lab. “You’re due back any minute 
now.” Bradley followed at a brisk 
trot, carrying the tape reels and the 
envelope. 

“What is all this stuff, sir?” he 
asked as the Director turned in 
through the Lab doors. “What am I 
supposed to do with it?” 

“The tape reels? One of them is 
you talking with me back two 
months ago, the one we were just 
listening to. The other is you talk- 
ing with me just now. You’re to 
take them back in time. And the 
envelope contains your detailed in- 
structions. Be very careful to go 
back and forth to exactly the times 
indicated there. Your routing is on 
the initial sheet. Ok?” They turned 
in through the last doors and the Di- 
rector motioned Bradley to be seat- 
ed. 

“What’s supposed to be happen- 
ing now?” he asked. There didn’t 
seem to be anything different about 
the Lab, Bradley noted, just the two 
time-machine mock-ups inside each 
other, the chairs and the big digital 
clock on the wall. 

“Quiet, Howard,” the Director 
commanded. “Watch that clock up 
there and write down exactly when 
you arrive.” 

Bradley obediently took out his 
pen and some paper but nothing 
happened for several seconds. Then, 
suddenly, a large cubical object 
materialized in front of them, 
exactly like the mock-ups. 



THE TIMELESS SPY 



135 



“10.26.01, on Jan. 15, 1978,” he 
wrote down. 

The doors opened and a man 
like himself jumped down, tugged 
at a very large object on the floor 
and rolled it out on its casters, pull- 
ing it off out of the way. 

“Mission accomplished, sir,” 
said the new arrival to the Director. 
The voice was exactly like his own 
and Bradley shivered. The face, 
too, was exactly like his own. 

The Director shook hands vigor- 
ously with Bradley’s double. “Con- 
gratulations, Howard! That was an 
excellent job you just did! Here, 
sign this,” he added, thrusting a 
piece of paper at him. 

The double shrugged, pulled out 
a pen and rapidly scribbled his sig- 

136 



nature. “I already signed this, you 
know,” he remarked. “Well, I 
need to go back now and do the rest 
of the mission. Hi there,” he add- 
ed, talking to Bradley. “Feeling a lit- 
tle strange?” 

Bradley was too stunned to reply. 
He watched in disbelief as the other 
man went back inside the machine, 
pressed a button to close the door, 
and suddenly — vanished. The whole 
thing vanished. 

“Well, Howard?” asked the Di- 
rector. “That’s your future self. All 
right, help me get this time machine 
unfolded.” 

Bradley, still mentally numb, 
moved to comply. Right side, up. 
Back, up. Left side, up. Move in- 
side, pull the top up. It was a lot 



GALAXY 



easier with two people both helping, 
he reflected. The Director moved 
over to the buttons on the outside 
right-hand side and pushed the 
‘LOCK’ button. There was a barely 
audible click as the locking 
mechanism went into place. 

“Ok, Howard,” said the Direc- 
tor. He moved over to the chair, 
quickly picking up the tapes and 
envelope from where Bradley had 
left them, and walked back inside 
the time machine. “Now, come in- 
side and watch me set the buttons. 
You’re supposed to arrive back at 
ten-thirty a.m., exactly, on No- 
vember fifteenth last year.” He 
set down the tap>es and envelope 
and pressed buttons rapidly. “Does 
that check out, Howard?” He 
moved backward toward the door. 

' Bradley looked closely at the but- 
tons. They seemed satisfactory. 
Suddenly the door clunked shut be- 
hind him. He wheeled around 
and — the Director vanished. 

The room, too, looked odd as he 
gazed at it through the window in the 
doorway. The chairs were arranged 
differently, all of a sudden. And the 
I time-machine mock-ups were not 
there. The clock on the wall, how- 
ever, still said 10.30. But not 
10.30 a.m. on January 15, 1978. It 
now read 10.30 on November 15, 
1977. 

This, thought Howard Bradley, 
was ridiculous. He hadn’t even 
I signed the permission form! The Di- 
rector must have — yes — just pressed 
the ‘SEND’ button and sent him. 



“Why should I?” he thought. 
Bradley scowled and pushed but- 
tons. 10.31.00 on January 15, 
1978. He moved his finger down to 
the ‘SEND’ button, hesitated — and 
pressed it. 

The Director reappeared. The 
chairs and the mock-ups were where 
they were. The clock on the wall 
said 10.31.01 on January 15th again. 
Howard Bradley smiled to himself 
as he watched the Director’s puz- 
zled, scowling face. 

As he watched, the Director 
strode to the right-hand side of the 
time machine, a grim expression on 
his face. The Director — van- 
ished . 

. and re-appeared where he 
had been five seconds earlier, 
scowling and striding to the door. 
Then again he — vanished .... 

Over and over again the Director 
vanished, reappeared where he had 
been and strode to the door, his 
finger outstretched. The clock on 
the wall, Howard noted, was end- 
lessly repeating the same five- 
second interval, from 10.31.00 to 
10.31.05. 

This was bad, he thought, very 
bad. Why, he could starve to death, 
or die of old age! And no one 
would ever find him! No, that was 
silly. Its batteries would run down 
eventually, if it used batteries. What 
power souce did it use, anyway? 
And he could still use the control 
panel to send himself forward or 
backward in time. Forward or 
backward? He could just go for- 



TH€ TIMELESS SPY 



137 




ward in time to when he was sup- 
posed to finish the mission and 
claim it had been successful. No, 
that wouldn’t work. The Director 
would find out the Russians still 
had their time machine. How about 
backward? He. could go back and 
warn himself — no, that sounded 
complicated .... 

Bradley paced to and fro inside 
the time machine, thinking as the 
seconds went by over and over 
again, and the Director endlessly 
strode toward the buttons on the 
door. The ‘OPEN’ button, of 
course! Any time he pressed it, the 
door would open some time within 
that five-second interval. It would 
just seem to the Director as if he 
hadn’t been able to get to the 
‘SEND’ button in time. And the 
‘SEND’ button wouldn’t work if the 
door were open. 

Was that right? His eye fell on 
the big manila envelope. Maybe he 
should read the instructions first. 
Why not? He had all the time in the 
world. More, in fact. 

Bradley sat down on the floor of 
the time machine and opened up the 
envelope. Too bad, he thought, that 
he couldn’t play the tape recordings 
without a machine. The Director 
hadn’t finished playing the one, he 
remembered. But were they correct 
in every way? The Director could, 
after all, have spliced out any mate- 
rial he didn’t want Bradley to hear. 
With the resources of the world’s 
greatest spy organization at his dis- 
posal, it would be child’s play for 

138 



him to alter the tapes, or even to 
create completely phony conversa- 
tions out of computer recombinations 
of voicesounds. 

Or to forge signatures. Bradley 
scowled as he pulled out the instruc- 
tions and found a permission form 
with his own signature. He put it 
aside and started reading the plan. ] 

The plan sounded a lot more ; 
sensible as he read through it care- i 
fully, though there were still a few ' 
puzzling loose ends. There was no I 
mention, for instance, of his current 
predicament, so things must have ^ 
happened differently last time. Or 
had they? The Director would not 
have known about what was hap- 
pening now and there was no real 
need to tell him. Or perhaps the Di- I 
rector had known but had deliber- 
ately refrained from mentioning it. 
There was, after all, no mention of 
the Director sneakily pressing the 
‘SEND’ button the first time, either. 
Bradley wrinkled his brows in puz- ! 
zlement but finally went back to 
reading the instructions. i 

It was 10.50 on his watch when 
he finished; so twenty minutes must 
have gone by, he figured. The clock 
outside on the Lab wall still said 
10.31.00 to 10.31.05, of course, 
over and over again. Well, pressing 
the ‘OPEN’ button would be the I 
easiest way out. He timed it so as 
to occur just after 10.31.00 and 
stepped toward the door. 

The Director, scowling, strode 
yet again toward the buttons on the 
right-hand side and pressed — the 

GALAXY 



‘CLOSE’ button. The door started 
closing again, but Bradley jammed 
his foot in it and the elevator-like 
door opened up again. 

“Howard Bradley! What are you 
doing back here so soon?” The Di- 
rector glared at Bradley, trying to 
stare him down. 

“Sir, I’ve been thinking.” Brad- 
ley stared right back. “Why don’t 
you go back and tell yourself about 
this mission, and then send — ” 

“No, Howard, no!” The Director 
stamped his foot, his right hand still 
poised near the buttons. “I don’t go 
on missions! My job is to stay back 
here at Headquarters and organize 
missions! Plan! Organize! Motivate! 
I took Organization Theory courses 
in graduate school, Howard. That’s 
why I’m up here and you’re back 
there. Plan! Organize! Motivate! 
Besides, I know I didn’t meet my- 
self back two months ago. It’d be 
ridiculous!” 

“Well, you could always do 
things differently this time, sir,” 
Bradley argued. “Besides, why 
don’t we just keep this time 
machine now we’ve got it instead 
of risking it back in the past? You 
know, if we’d thought a little before 
sending back the other Howard 
Bradley, we could’ve kept two time 
machines!” 

“No, Howard, no.” The Director 
shook his head. “We’ve got to do 
things exactly the way we did them 
j last time if we possibly can. 

Otherwise, who knows what might 
! happen? We’ve got to get that time 

THE TIMELESS SPY 



machine away from the Russians. 
Look, Howard, you’ve only been 
thinking about this for an hour or 
so, but I've had a whole two 
months to think about all the 
ramifications. Believe me, I know 
what I’m talking about! 

“Besides,” he continued in a 
wheedling tone of voice, “you saw 
yourself come back, didn’t you? 
Why, this is the safest mission 
you’ve ever been on! Guaranteed re- 
turn!” 

Twenty minutes later Howard 
Bradley was back in the time 
machine, ready to go. The Director 
had convinced him. He pressed the 
buttons on the dial for 10.32.00 on 
November 15, 1977 (a couple of 
minutes later than the original 10.30 
a.m.; best not to risk colliding with 
himself, the Director had said); 
noted the time on the wall clock, 
10.51.10, and pressed the ‘SEND’ 
button as the Director bade him 
farewell. 

The Director vanished and — the 
loud wailing of the Research Lab’s 
alarm siren filled the air. The door 
opened and Bradley saw, in front 
of him, two stem-faced guards with 
their weapons drawn. 

“Hands up, whoever you are!” 
commanded one of the guards. “No 
unauthorized persons are allowed in 
here!” 

Bradley obediently raised his 
hands. “Take me to the Director,” 
he requested. 

“That’s exactly where you’re go- 
ing,” the guard snarled. “He’ll be 

139 



very interested in seeing you.” 

What had gone wrong? thought 
Bradley as they marched him along 
the corridors. Of course! The first 
appearance of the time machine had 
alerted them, and the guards had 
been sent in during the next two 
minutes. They probably thought he 
was a Russian spy since the Rus- 
sians had the only time machine. 
Well, he could explain things to the 
Director easily enough. 

The Director was sitting at his 
polished oak desk, a stern expres- 
sion on his face. “And who do you 
think yoM are?” he demanded. 

“Howard Bradley, sir, reporting 
for duty. I just arrived here in a 
time machine from two months in 
the future. It is extremly important 
that you make a hotel reservation at 
the Zurich Hilton, in Suite five- 
hundred ten, as soon as possible 
and for as long a time as possible.” 

The Director leaned back in his 
seat and glared uncomprehendingly. 
“Rubbish!” he snorted. “Howard 
Bradley is out on assignment now. 
He couldn’t possibly have gotten 
back here in this time, let alone in a 
Russian time machine. You, mister, 
are a Russian spy, traveling in a 
Russian time machine and cleverly 
disguised to resemble Howard Brad- 
ley. Well?” 

Howard Bradley sighed to him- 
self. This was going to be difficult. 
Very difficult. 

It was six days later, No- 
vember 21, 1977, and Howard 

Bradley smiled happily to himself. 



An empty time machine had just 
materialized in the Zurich Hilton 
Hotel, Suite 510, much to the Di- 
rector’s amazement, just an hour 
after the American agents in Swit- 
zerland had moved in and cleared a 
free area, according to telephoned 
reports. 

They had immediately folded it 
up, packed it in a box and man- 
handled it out of the building; and it 
was now being flown across the At- 
lantic by military jet. Everything 
was going very well, Bradley re- 
flected. Everything was going 
exactly as planned. 

The hotel, for instance, had origi- 
nally been booked solid right past 
New Year’s, with the Russians re- 
serving Suite 510 for January 12th 
and all the rest of 1978. But an un- 
expected cancellation had enabled 
them to book the room for 
November 20th through the 22nd. A 
strange quirk of fate, that cancella- 
tion, thought Bradley. Or was it? 

Meanwhile, the Agency’s scien- 
tists had been busily disassembling 
the time machine, stripping it down 
to basics but, just as Bradley had 
predicted, they couldn’t figure it 
out. And the Director had insisted, 
very firmly, that the basic working 
parts should not be handled in any 
way that would risk their destruc- 
tion. Bradley shrugged to himself 
and settled back to catch up on 
some reading. 

A few hours later Bradley’s 
office phone rang. “It’s here, How- 
ard,” said the Director’s voice. 



140 



GALAXY 



“Come on over to the Research Lab 
and it’ll be up the freight elevator in 
just a couple of minutes.” 

Bradley whistled to himself as he 
strolled over to the Lab. Everything 
had gone very nicely. The unpleas- 
ant effects of the sodium pentazoan- 
ate had long since worn off, the Di- 
rector had bought him some new 
clothes and everything had worked 
out exactly as planned. He walked 
in the Lab door and found the Di- 
rector in there already, tapping his 
foot nervously. 

“Good, Howard,” he remarked. 
“Everything is right on time. The 
men should be here soon. We’re all 
set for you to take it forward in 
time.” 

Bradley looked around observ- 
antly. The time machine had been 
reassembled a few feet from where 
he had arrived in it, in exactly the 
same location that he had seen his 
double arrive before. The Director, 
he remembered, had included exact 
locational information in his packet 
of instructions. The clock on the 
wall read a little after four in the af- 
ternoon, 16.02.15, November 21, 
1977. 

The door at the other end of the 
room opened and four workmen 
wheeled in a big container, seven 
feet by seven by two. They put it 
down carefully, unwrappfed it and, 
at the Director’s instructions, 
wheeled it along, up and into the 
other time machine. 

The Director clambered up on top 
of the folded time machine and 



checked the setting on the outer 
one. “Your double arrived at 
exactly 10.28.01 on January fif- 
teenth, right, Howard?” Bradley 
nodded. “Good,” continued the Di- 
rector, climbing out. “Now re- 
member, Howard, be sure to do 
things exactly as before. We don’t 
want to foul things up.” 

“Sir, couldn’t we just send the 
one time machine back empty by 
pressing the button?” Bradley 
asked. 

“Oh, no.” The Director frowned 
impatiently. “We’ve already got 
them inside each other now any- 
way. And besides, very possibly 
your arrival there is exactly what’ll 
be needed to convince your earlier 
self that it’s safe to go. Ok, How- 
ard, let’s get a move on. 

“I’m going to send you off at 
exactly 16.06.00 and then you 
reset the numbers to come back five 
seconds later at 16.06.05. Right?” 

Bradley shrugged and climbed 
up on top of the inner time 
machine. The Director pushed the 
‘CLOSE’ button. The doors closed, 
then he waited carefully, watching 
the clock, reached out for the 
‘SEND’ button at exactly 16.06.00 
and — the Director vanished. 

Bradley quickly readjusted buttons 
for 16.06.05, pressed the ‘OPEN’ 
button, jumped down and pulled 
out the folded-up time machine, 
rolling it out on its casters to a nearby 
spot. 

“Mission accomplished, sir,” he 
reported to the Director. 



THE TIMELESS SPY 



141 



The Director shook his hand. 
“Congratulations, Howard! That 
was an excellent job you just did! 
Here, sign this.” He thrust’a per- 
mission form into Bradley’s hands. 

Bradley looked at it, shrugged, 
and pulled out a pen to sign it. “I 
already signed this, you know,” he 
remarked. “Well, I need to go back 
now and do the rest of the mis- 
sion.” 

Over by the Director he 
noticed — his earlier self. Another 
Howard Bradley, mouth agape. 
“Hi, there,” he remarked to the 
double. “Feeling a little strange?” 

There was no reply and Bradley 
walked back inside the time 
machine, pressed the ‘CLOSE’ but- 
ton, double-checked the time set- 



ting and pressed ‘SEND’ again. 
The January scene vanished and 
the Director reappeared, almost 
exactly where Bradley had left him 
earlier. 

“Good work, Howard,’ called 
the Director. Bradley opened the 
door and walked out and the Direc- 
tor instijicted the workmen to fold 
up and pack the time machine he 
had come back in. 

“Ok, Howard,” the Director in- 
structed. “Grab your suitcase, 
we’re off to Switzerland by military 
jet. Up, up into the wild blue yon- 
der!” 

It was twelve hours later. They 
were in a hotel room in Zurich and 
Howard Bradley was having last- 
minute qualms. It was 10.02 in the 




142 



GAIAXY 



morning, European time, November 
22, 1977, and the blinds and cur- 
tains were drawn tight against the 
1 morning sunlight. 

! “All right, Howard,” the Direc- 
I tor was saying. “We’ve adjusted 
the little lever down below for the 
, six hours’ difference between Euro- 
j pean time and Eastern Standard 
Time. Let’s check over your 
equipment. Pistol, ok. Dart-gun 
with three needles of truth-serum, 

■ ok. Flashlight, ok. Handcuffs, 
rope coils, ok. Two cans of 
j emergency food rations and water, 

' ok. Suitcase with extra supplies of 
everything, ok. Empty suitcase, 
ok. List of instructions, ok. 

“Now, I’ll go over the plan of 
instructions one more time. You’ll 
go back to four in the morning on 
October fifteenth, the last night that 
the inventor stayed in this suite be- 
I fore checking out. Remember, keep 
I your finger on the ‘SEND’ button. 
That’ll keep you stuck at one instant 
of time while you look around to 
I see if things are safe without being 
I seen except for a flickering instant 
• of time. If it’s not safe, go back an 
I hour earlier, or another hour earlier, 

’ or a day earlier. Go earlier, because 
I then you won’t have been seen yet. 



“When you go back, you should 
see one or possibly more other time 
machines. You’re to send one of 
them back, empty, to the time we 
picked it up, at 14.00.00 on Novem- 
ber twentieth, two days ago, just 
after our agents first checked into 



the hotel. We know where it 
landed, so we’ve put your machine 
facing its door, a few feet away. 
You’ll need to open it, set the time, 
get out, close it and send it. Right? 

“After that, you’re on your own. 
Send back any other time machines 
you can lay your hands on, or any 
blueprints, and come back yourself, 
to 10.10.00 today, November 
twenty-second. Be very careful, the 
Russians may be sending their own 
spy back. Don’t try to kidnap the 
inventor. Get back first and then I’ll 
decide if the risks are worth it. Ok? 

“You'll be arriving back just a 
few minutes after we send you and 
then we’ll have to pack everything 
up quickly so as to be out of the 
room by the eleven a.m. hotel 
checkout time.” 

“Er, sir,” said Bradley. “I’ve 
been thinking. The instructions have 
been very specific prior to this 
point but now they seem to have 
all kinds of contingency statements 
in them, as though your future self 
didn’t know exactly what had hap- 
pened except for the earlier time 
machine being sent back. And 
there’s no mention in the instruc- 
tions of what happened after I get 
back, or am supposed to get back. 
Why? Was the mission successful? 
Will it be? Will I get back? 

“You know, if I get back, 
wouldn’t your future self have told 
me about it, so as to motivate me? 
Sir,” he continued, quietly and 
matter-of-factly, “I think I’m going 
to die on this mission.”

American Heart Association. (Jo 

WE’RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE 

The Director shook his head. 
“No, Howard, you’re not going to 
die. I guarantee it. Things are going 
to work out as planned. Howard,” 
he improvised, “when you get 
back. I’m . going to be sure that my 
future self does not inform your 
earlier self that the mission has been 
successful. 

“Now, Howard,” he continued 
quickly. “It’s almost time to go. 
I’m going to close your door and 
turn off the lights, as we planned, 
to accommodate your eyes to the 
blackness at four a.m., and then I’m 



going to count down to zero. Keep 
your finger near the ‘SEND’ button 
and your other hand on the 
flashlight. Lights off now; seven, 
six, five, four, three, two, one, 
SEND!” 

Bradley pushed the ‘SEND’ but- 
ton, keeping it jammed down 
firmly, and — the lights all went on 
again, very brightly. He put the 
flashlight back in his pocket and 
peered around warily, still keeping 
his finger on the button. No time 
machines out there, nothing but or- 
dinary hotel furniture. The bed in 
the next room of the suite looked 
slept in, very rumpled, and Bradley 
could see little marks from the cas- 
ters in a square pattern where the 
other time machine ought to be. 
The carp>et looked as if it had re- 
cently been walked on, and there 
was a button and a tom piece of 
colored material on the floor 
nearby. 

He cautiously removed his finger 
from the ‘SEND’ button. Nothing 
was different except he could see 
the curtains rippling gently above 
the air current from the hotel heat- 
ing vent. Very little noise, too. He 
peered around some more — still 
nothing — and pressed the ‘OPEN’ 
button. Nothing. He walked around, 
cautiously. There were caster marks 
over on the left, too, in another 
square pattern. There was a file 
cabinet, too, open with nothing in 
it. No people, no one. The bed def- 
initely looked slept in. The clock 
on the wall said 4.02 a.m. 



144 



GALAXY 



Ok, try again. He came back in, 
closed the door, set the button for 3 
a.m., and pressed ‘SEND,’ holding 
it down hard. 

The lights — were still on. A time 
machine was in front of him, open. 
And over to the right two men 
were locked together in a struggle, 
frozen in mid-action. A tough- 
looking man in dark clothes and an 
older, white-haired man in pajamas. 
Ivan Ivanovich and Helmut Hein- 
rich! The Russian spy must be kid- 
napping the inventor! (Or vice 
versa? Implausible. They both were 
about two hundred pounds, like 
himself, Bradley estimated, but the 
older man would be no match in a 
struggle.) 

Neither of them were looking in 
his direction, fortunately, so neither 
of them would see him. Bradley 
craned his neck, still holding tight 
to the ‘SEND’ button, and saw, 
over on the left, what looked like 
the comer of a third time machine. 
They really should design these 
things with glass all around, he 
thought, and a ‘SEND’ button that 
could be locked down when needed. 
Well, too late now to think of that. 

Ok, 2 a.m., see what’s going on 
an hour earlier. Bradley pressed the 
2 button and — the lights went out. 
There was only a slight glow from a 
night-light, Bradley noted, as his 
eyes adjusted to the gloom: the two 
struggling men were no longer 
there nor was the time machine in 
front of him. But the one over on 
the left was still there, or its comer 



was. Over to the right, in the bed- 
room, the inventor appeared to be 
asleep in his bed. Bradley relaxed 
the ‘SEND’ button for a few mo- 
ments before jamming it back and 
heard a loud snoring sound. Ok, 
the Russian had not yet arrived. Try 
2.45 a.m. 

Bradley pushed buttons again. 
2.45, ‘send’ and — the time machine 
in front of him reappeared, its door 
still open. The lights were still off, 
the inventor was still in bed, but 
over to the left was the faint glow 
from a different light — a flashlight, 
perhaps? The third time machine’s 
comer was still there and Bradley, 
craning his neck, caught a glimpse 
of the back of the man in dark 
clothing over where the empty file 
cabinet had been an hour and a 
quarter later at 4 a.m. 

Bradley risked a second of time 
with his finger off the ‘SEND’ but- 
ton before jamming it on again and 
heard the faint mstling of papers 
from his left and the inventor’s 
loud snoring from his right. He 
risked two seconds, then three, then 
five — no problems. He tiptoed to 
the door to risk a better view, then 
darted back to the ‘SEND’ button. 
The Russian was looking straight 
away from him, into the file 
cabinet — looking for blueprints, 
perhaps? 

If he could just cross the inter- 
vening six feet to the open time 
machine, Bradley estimated, he 
would be shielded from view by its 
left side, could set the buttons, duck 



THE TIMELESS SPY 



145 



around to the right-hand side, be 
shielded from view again, and close 
its door and sent it to November 
20th, when it had arrived earlier. It 
would take no more than twelve 
seconds, Bradley estimated, if he 
did it all without fumbling, and then 
he could duck back inside his own 
time machine, press the ‘SEND’ 
button to freeze time again and 
consider his next move. 

Ok, testing. Bradley tried 15 sec- 
onds with the ‘send’ button off. No 
reaction, good. He pressed ‘send’ to 
go back to 2.45.00 again, then 
pressed the ‘OPEN’ button, walked 
quietly out, across and into the 
nearby time machine, flashlight 
ready but not on; flashed the light 
briefly, pressed 14.00.00 for 
November 20, 1977; walked quietly 
out and around to the right-hand 
side and prepared to press ‘close’ 
and ‘send.’ 

‘close;’ the door closed, with a 
clunk, ‘send;’ the time machine van- 
ished and — the Russian wheeled 
around, startled by the noise of the 
door closing, as Bradley dived for 
cover within his own time machine. 

Bang! The Russian fired wildly in 
Bradley’s direction. Bang! Bradley 
fired back. Bang! Bang! Bang! 
Bang! Two more shots by each of 
them, no hits. 

“What the hell is going on 
around here?” came a voice in gut- 
teral Swiss-accented German. It was 
the inventor, roused from his sleep 
by the noise. The lights all went on 
and Bradley saw him over to the 



right in his pajamas, his hand on 
the light switch. 

Bang! Bang! Another miss by 
each of them. The Russian was get- 
ting too damn close for comfort, 
Bradley thought. This bullet had 
smashed into the metal of the time 
machine only six inches to his right. 

“What the hell are you gangsters 
doing shooting up my hotel room?” 
the inventor demanded. “Why is 
this second time machine in here? 
Who do you think you are, you 
idiots?” He was standing in the 
bedroom doorway, shaking his 
walking stick at them, oblivious to 
the danger in his anger. Bradley and 
Ivanovich ignored him. 

Bang! The Russian had shot at 
Bradley’s time machine instead of 
at Bradley, at the motor on the 
right-hand side, and a shower of 
blue sparks shot up in the air as the 
bullet ploughed through the machin- 
ery. Too late Bradley pressed the 
‘close’ button, the ‘send’ button, 
the ‘open’ button in wild succes- 
sion. None of them worked. 

“You’ve wrecked my time 
machine, you maniacs!” the inven- 
tor screamed. “It’s worth a billion 
dollars!” 

Bang! Bradley fired at the Rus- 
sian again, barely missing. Only 
one bullet left now, he thought. Bet- 
ter make the next one count, there 
might not be time to reload. 

“Stop that this instant!” yelled 
the inventor. “You’re destroying 
hotel property! You’ll go to jail 
until you rot if I have anything to 



146 



GALAXY 



say about it!” # 

Bradley crouched down, aiming, 
waiting for the Russian to move 
into range. He saw the Russian’s 
gun hand move into view, squeezed 
the trigger and — 

Bang! “Ow!” He saw the gun 
fall from the Russian’s hand, 
dropped his own gun and pulled 
out his dart-gun, moving in for the 
kill. One dart to make the Russian 
talk, two darts of truth serum to kill 
him. 

Thwack! Excruciating pain seared 
at Bradley’s nerves as a dart nee- 
dled into his right thigh. Gritting his 
teeth to ignore the pain, Bradley 
aimed, squeezed the trigger and — 
“Ow!” The Russian screamed in 
pain. 

“Stop this at once!” commanded 
the inventor, striding into the main 
room and brandishing his walking- 
stick as if it were a weapon. Brad- 
ley and the Russian circled him 
nervously, each trying to keep the 
inventor between himself and the 
other man. The Russian had a 
dart-gun too, Bradley noted, prob- 
ably a three-dart Israeli-made T-33 
like his own if intelligence reports 
were correct, and he was holding it 
left-handed while a trickle of blood 
oozed down from his right hand. A 
dart was still sticking in the Rus- 
sian’s left leg. 

Thwack! Thwack! Two darts 
buried themselves in the furniture 
on the opposite sides of the ‘room 
as the two gunmen circled the in- 
ventor between them. Only one dart 



left, thought Bradley, then he’d 
have to go to hand-to-hand combat. 

“Who are you?" the inventor 
demanded again. “What are you 
doing here?” 

Bradley felt a terrible urge to tell 
the truth coursing through his veins. 
“I am an American spy, Howard 
Bradley,” he stated, talking in 
German so the inventor could un- 
derstand. “I came back here in time 
to steal the Russian’s time machine 
and any blueprints I could find.” 

“And you?” demanded the in- 
ventor, pointing his cane at the 
Russian. “Why did you come 
here?” 

“I am a Russian spy, Ivan 
Ivanovich,” admitted Bradley’s op- 
posite number. “I came down here 
from January 15th, 1978, in the time 
machine you sold us so as to steal 
the time-machine’s blueprints and 
kidnap you. Then that American 
spy made my time machine go off 
in the future somewhere, so I 
started shooting at him.” 

“You maniacs!” yelled the in- 
ventor. “You can’t do this to me. 
This is Swiss territory and I am a 
Swiss citizen! You’ll rot in jail for a 
thousand years when the police get 
here! Destruction of hotel property! 
Attempted kidnapping! Attempted 
theft of trade secrets! 

“And what,” he continued, turn- 
ing and pointing accusingly at Brad- 
ley’s ruined machine, “is the other 
time machine doing here? How did 
it get here?” 

“I cannot tell a lie,” stated Brad- 



THE TIMELESS SPY 



147 



ley. “I stole the Russian’s time 
machine that he came back here in, 
sent it forward in time to November 
20th, then we folded it, flew it across 
the Atlantic to our Headquarters, 
sent it forward to January 15th inside 
a later version of itself, and I un- 
folded it, came back in time to 
November 15th to inform my boss 
of this mission, then used it briefly 
to send its earlier self up to January 
15th next year, came back to 
November 21st, we folded it, flew 
it back across the Atlantic and 
brought it into this hotel room, and 
then took it back in time to now so 
I could steal the Russian’s time 
machine and any other time 
machines 1 could lay my hands 
on.” 

“You idiot!” shouted the inven- 
tor. “You’re twisting the structure 
of time back on itself like a pretzel! 
And you think you could steal the 
original time machine, do you? You 
couldn’t, you fool! If you tried, all 
this would never have happened!” 

“Shut up!” Ivanovich inter- 
rupted. “Where are those blue- 
prints, you old fool? How does the 
time machine work?” 

“I’m not going to tell you and 
you’re stupid if you think I would!” 
The inventor turned toward the Rus- 
sian, defiantly staring him down. 

“We have ways to make you 
talk,” Ivanovich retorted. “Answer, 
before I count to five. One, two, 
three, four . .” 

“Now’s my chance to hit the 
Russian,” thought Bradley, “while 



he’d distracted. Aim, fire and .... 

Two darts suddenly thwacked 
into the inventor as he screamed in 
pain. 

“You fool, you’ve killed him!” 
shouted Bradley. 

“No! You!” yelled the Russian. 
“It was your dart that did it! My 
dart was just to make him talk!” 

“Your dart!” “Your dart!” The 
two spies rushed at each other, 
wrestling each other down to the 
floor as they struggled for a death- 
grip- 

“You’ve killed me! You’ve kill- 
ed me!” screamed the inventor. He 
strode over to where they lay 
struggling, whacking impartially at 
them with his cane. “Take that, 
you assassins! Take that! And that! 
And that!” as he hit them savage 
blows on the arms, legs and head. 

“Where are the blueprints?” de- 
manded Ivanovich hoarsely. “Tell 
the truth!” 

“I burned them before I came 
here to the hotel to negotiate! The 
knowledge is all up here in my 
head! It will die with me when I 
die! 

“Oh, no 1 won’t!” The inventor 
suddenly strode over to the other 
time machine, pressing its ‘OPEN’ 
button. 

“You stupid superpowers can’t 
be trusted with an invention as 
powerful as this!” The time 
machine’s door opened and he 
strode inside to the buttons. “I’ll go 
back in time and warn myself never 
to reveal the secret of this. It’s the

GALAXY 



only way to unkill myself!” 

The door closed on him as the 
Russian’s hands tightened in a 
death-grip around Bradley’s neck 
and .... 

. The Russian spy vanished 
and Howard Bradley suddenly 
found himself standing up instead of 
on the floor, falling two inches 
downward in a sudden Jolt. He 
hurt all over, on his head, arms, 
legs and right thigh, and his 
neck. He was in the Research Lab 
again, Bradley noted in puzzlement, 
at the American Headquarters. The 
two time-machine mock-ups had 
vanished but everything else was 
unchanged and the digital clock on 
the wall read 10.51.11, on January 
15, 1978, just one second later than 



when he had set out. 

But set out on what? He 
scratched his head in puzzlement as 
he noticed the Director striding to- 
ward him with outstretched hand. 

The Director shook hands vigor- 
ously. “Congratulations, Howard! 
That was an excellent job you just 
did this morning!” 

“Excellent job, sir? On what?” 
“Er, on. .” The Director 
looked baffled. “An excellent job, 
anyway. ...” The Director’s voice 
trailed away and he looked distrac- 
tedly up at the wall clock as if that 
somehow held the key to the situa- 
tion. “10.51.35, Howard, right on 
time. Er, Howard — why don’t you 
just take the rest of the day off, 
since you’re back so soon?” ★

THE TIMELESS SPY 



149 




Tftf first silver cannister is 
labeled “Scarlet Seabird’’ in Mr. 
Ross’s black, definite handwriting. 
When I press the button set into the 
handrail of the grandstand, there is 
a sudden flare of rocket and the 
cannister begins to lift. Slowly at 
first, and then rapidly faster against 
the weak Lunar gravity, it lifts 
higher and higher. In only mo- 
ments, it is just a spark that is al- 
most lost against the stars. And 
then, in eerie silence, it blossoms 
and blossoms and blossoms. It 
seems that the whole sky is covered 
with shining, glowing scarlet wings. 
In my earphones, I hear the in- 
drawn breaths of the other people 
around me. High, high above, 
kilometers wide now. Scarlet Sea- 
bird flies. 

It was all my fault that the bad 
things happened to Mr. Ross. It was 
just my big mouth that did it. I 
wanted to be a big-shot. 

It was on the afternoon of the 
first day at the Lunar Departure 
Processing Center when my Aunt 
Mavril called. She was a reporter 
for the Washington Post and I usu- 
ally Just got a Christmas card and a 
dollar from her. But when they 
called me to the telephone in the 
Departure Center office, her face in 
the screen was all smiles and she 
acted as if I were her very favorite. 

“You’re going to be the youngest 
person who ever went to the 
Moon,’’ she said. “Just nine. And 
so you’re News! I’m going to inter- 
view you right now. Chuck.’’ 



“You’re going to put me in the 
paper?” I asked, all excited. I was 
so excited that I told her all about 
Mr. Ross, too. I wish so much that 
I hadn’t. 

The second cannister is “Won- 
derful Dragon.’’ It goes up into the 
Lunar sky on its tiny rocket engine, 
trailing sparks of blue and gold, 
aiming haphazardly at Scarlet Sea- 
bird which drifts effortlessly, 
kilometers high, slowly, slowly mov- 
ing higher and higher. High above, 
so high that we all thought that it 
must be defective. Wonderful Dra- 
gon finally explodes from a tiny 
sparkle into enormous bursts of blue 
and gold that shape into jagged 
teeth and claws and spiney tail and 
forking, furious tongue. 

All of the other people going to 
the Moon were families or were so 
busy with their own business that it 
was just natural that old Mr. Ross 
and young me should be friends. So 
that night, he and I ate dinner to- 
gether and talked. I kept quiet about 
my surprise, though. 

“My dad is Vice- Administrator 
of the Lunar Colony,” I said. 
“And my mother’s a lawyer. And 
now, finally. I’m going to get to go 
live with them. On the Moon.” 

Mr. Ross’s face went very young 
when he smiled. And he smiled a 
lot — until later, when he found out 
what I had done. “When I was 
your age,” he said, “nobody did 
anything but snicker when someone 
said something about going to the 
Moon. I guess I snickered, too.” 



MY FRIEND'S LAST SHOW 



151 







He was a sculptor, working in 
wood and clay and steel and 
aluminum and glass and, I guess, 
just about anything that had a form 
within it. And now that he was 
eighty-nine, he was going to go live 
on the Moon. 

“They say I’ll be able to move 
around up there just like a kid of 
sixty.” He looked up at the ceiling 
of the dining hall as if he could see 
through it to the Moon. 

“Well, what about your family?” 
I asked. “Won’t they miss you?” 

He looked at me and laughed. 
“Yeah, well, I guess they will. But 
not the right way. I’m afraid.” 

The dessert was some kind of 
green, gluey pudding and now Mr. 
Ross used the handle of a spoon 
and worked at it quickly. His hands 
and arms were very big and strong- 
looking, but they worked gently and 
precisely. 

“You must not have any fami- 
ly,” I said. 

“Well, Chuck, I have relatives, 
you might say.” 

“Whatever you’re doing with that 
pudding is the best thing I can think 
of to do with it, Mr. Ross. It sure 
isn’t worth eating. But you sure 
have lost me with what you said.” 

“I don’t want you to be lost.” 
He worked on with the spoon for a 
while. Then he said, “I don’t have 
a wife or sons or daughters. I don’t 
have anybody close. I guess I loved 
too many times. And none of the 
loves was still here when it came 
time to run away to the Moon. The 



relatives I’ve got are just waiting 
around for me to die. To get my 
money.” 

“I’m still kind of lost,” I said. 

“You’ll understand sometime,” 
he said, sliding his dessert bowl 
across to me. Looking up out of it 
was my own face, done in the green 
pudding. 

/ press the button that sets off 
“Silver Spectacle’’ and it rises and 
far, far above, throws out kilomet- 
ers and kilometers of sparkling 
silver threads into the dark, airless 
sky. 

We went outside then, into the 
night, to the gardens around the 
Departure Processing Center. The 
Moon seemed bigger and brighter 
than ever before. 

“They all needed me,” Mr. Ross 
said. “But they needed what I had, 
not what I was. When Nephew 
Tommy needed braces, or when 
Jean-Anne had to go to an analyst, 
and so on and so on. Uncle Paul 
was always there with the cash. 
Some of it, they even paid back for 
a little while. Sometimes they even 
thanked me.” 

He was silent then and I finally 
said, “I wish that hadn’t been just 
pudding. Maybe after we get to the 
Moon, you’ll do one that’ll last 
longer than just green pudding.” 

Mr. Ross laughed and messed up 
my hair. “Eternal Art. That’s what 
everyone always wants.” 

“Well, there’s nothing wrong 
with eternal, is there? Why don’t 
you do a great big thing on one of 



152 



GALAXY 



the Moon mountains, Mr. Ross?” 

He laughed again. “I used to 
think about doing just that. But now 
I like the pudding things better.” 
“I’ll try to understand that, too,” 
I said. 

“Colors, 1945,’’ goes up as I 
press another button. It expands 
across the black sky like a million 
rainbows. Colors / never heard of 
or thought of drift and float. 

“A long time ago, I decided it,” 
Mr. Ross said. “I was with friends, 
out on the beach in the summer, 
drinking wine and saying good 
things and thinking good things and 
looking at the Moon. And I decided 
then that, someday, I was going to 
take all my money and turn every- 
thing I could into money and use it 
to run away to the Moon and live 
there for as much longer as I had 
and then be buried there. Tommy’s 
braces and Mary Ellen’s college and 
all of those things would just have 
to take care of themselves. I de- 
cided that it was my money and I’d 
spend it on myself, no matter how 
guilty it might make me feel.” 

“I’m glad you’re my friend,” I 
said. “I’m glad I don’t have to go 
to the Moon by myself.” 

“After we get to the Moon, I’ll 
make something for you out of 
something just a little more eternal 
than green pudding. Chuck. Maybe 
it’ll even be eternal enough so that 
someday you can use it to help you 
get something you want very, very 
much.” 

I didn’t understand. 



“Well, the last year and a half 
has been just one big garage sale. 
Chuck. I’ve sold things I thought I 
never could part with. But now my 
last art show’s all put together and 
finished and my ticket’s paid for 
and I’m on my way. I’m on my 
way.” 

“Won’t you miss your relatives 
just a little?” 

He just laughed. “I hope you’ll 
never really understand that.” 

“Wonderful Dragon, high and 
far away, is fading, fading, tatter- 
ing away. The incredibly thin film 
has unfurled and scattered brilliant 
light for many minutes. Now it is 
pulling apart, ending. / press the 
button for “Flamingo Summer, 
1976,’’ but I don’t see its little 
rocket engine flame and lift because 
there are tears in my eyes and when 
you cry in an air-suit, you just have 
to wait a while. Finally, though, I 
can see again, and I watch the 
flamingo arc across the Lunar 
skies. 

And the next day, I began to under- 
stand about Mr. Ross’s family. 

Each morning of the five days it 
took at the Lunar Departure Process- 
ing Station was filled with all 
kinds of medical tests. Finally, I got 
through for the day and went racing 
through the living area to go to the 
shop where there were newspapers 
for sale. 

Mr. Ross was sitting in the lobby 
and I saw the headlines of the 
newspaper he held before I saw his 
face. 



MY FRIEND'S LAST SHOW 



153 



“YOUNGEST AND OLDEST 
LUNAR/BOUND TOGETHER,” 

the headlines said. And there were 
big pictures of both Mr. Ross and 
me from the Departure Center’s 
files. 

“We’re in the papers,” I yelled. 

And then Mr. Ross looked at me. 
For a long time, he looked at me. 
And then he smiled. Only this time 
the smile didn’t make him look 
young and new. It was a different 
kind of smile. 

“Yes, we are. Chuck,” he said, 
folding the newspaper and reaching 
out to mess up my hair. “We’re in 
the papers. We waited too long to 
run away and now we’re in the pa- 
pers.” 

That afternoon his relatives 
came. With lawyers. Mr. Ross went 
away with them, looking very, very 
old. A little later, I watched as his 
crates were unloaded from the 
Moonship and stored away. 

“Shimmering Star” is next. It 
rockets up from the dead floor of 
the Moon and lifts gossamer blue 
and yellow and silver brilliances 
over the sky. 

“It’s what they call ‘incompe- 
tence,’ ” my mother said, explain- 
ing it to me after I was on the 
Moon. “It’s a legal term used for 
when someone isn’t able to take 
care of his own business any 
longer. For when an old person 
starts doing silly, senile things.” 

“Going away to the Moon isn’t 
incompetent,” I said, angry that I 



was crying where someone could 
see me. 

“Red and White Dreams” goes 
up now, as / touch the ignition but- 
ton. Scarlet Seabird has disap- 
peared into .tattered, drifting mists. 
Wonderful Dragon is a shimmering 
after-image. 

My allowance was five dollars a 
week. A real letter to Earth cost 
almost a dollar a page. 

Dear Aunt Mavril, 

This was all my fault. I 
shouldn’t have blabbed about 
Mr. Ross so you’d put him in 
the papers and his relatives 
would find him. But isn’t there 
anything somebody can do? 
This postage is going to cost 
me a lot of money, but here’s 
what happened and what Mr. 
Ross really wanted. 

Dear Senator Pyrimen, 

My name is Charles Burke and 
I’m the youngest person on the 
Moon and I hope you’ll read 
my letter yourself and 

help. 

Dear Mr. President, 

I am the youngest person on 
the Moon and hope you can 
take time from your busy day 
to read my letter and maybe do 
something to help Mr. 

Ross. 

“Running and Playing” goes into 
the Lunar sky now. It’s all yellow 
and red streamers, lifting and play- 
ing arui shimmering. 



154 



GALAXY 



Dear Mr. Hardesty, 

My father says you own the 
biggest magazitie in the world. 

I hope you’ll listen to my prob- 
lem. I’m the youngest person 
on the Moon and I only say 
that so that maybe it will attract 
your attention, like human 
interest, so something can be 
done for my friend, Mr. Ross. 
I wrote to the President and a 
lot of senators and everybody, 
but it just seems that nobody 
cares. 

“Blue Winter Storm” rockets into 
the dark sky, lighting it with jagged 
clouds and electrical snowfall. 

She came to our apartment in the 
evening, almost six months after I 
got to the Moon. 

“Youre Charles Burke,” the 
bright, pretty, dark-haired lady said, 
while behind her a man fiddled 
with a camera and meters and wires 
and dials. 

“I’m Ilona Mosher, with the 
Columbia Broadcasting Systeip,” 
she said, turning her smile toward 
my mother and father. “With your 
permission, I want to interview 
Chuck. About Paul Ross.” 

“My letters finally worked!” I 
yelled happily. 

“Letters?” Ilona Mosher said, 
puzzled. “I don’t know about any 
letters. But I do know that you’re 
the youngest person on the Moon 
and that you were a friend of Paul 
Ross. He was a very well-known 
artist and, now that he’s dead, we 



want to do a story on your friend- 
ship. An old, old man and a 
young. ...” 

“What did you say?” I shouted 
at her. 

“Twilight Thought” is the next 
cannister. It is a warm mixture of 
beiges and greens and dusky, burnt 
oranges. It’s not bright and toy-like 
tike most of the others. But it is 
beautiful against the dark sky. 

The judge pounded for quiet. “In 
view of all the unusual publicity 
which has surrounded this case of 
the probate of the estate of Paul 
Ross, I am going to ask a favor of 
the attorneys.” 

After talking with them in a low 
voice, the judge said, “Because of 
the youth of the young man who 
has made such a long journey to 
come here as a ‘friend of the court,’ 
the attorneys have agreed that I may 
talk with him myself, in my cham- 
bers for a time. Court will be in re- 
cess for thirty minutes.” 

“Autumn Unicorn” flies out into 
the airless sky. It is all scintillating 
whites and pearls, with golden 
hooves and silver horn and red, red 
mouth and eyes of glowing green. 

I wished that I were back on the 
Moon again when the judge said he 
was ready to announce his decision. 
My mother had told me again and 
again what would happen. 

I hated the smiling faces of Mr. 
Ross’s relatives who were about to 
get his money. Money they were 
going to get just because they had 
said he was a crazy old man. 



MY FRIEND'S LAST SHOW 



155 




And sure enough, the judge said, 
“Under the laws of this state, the 
court has no choice but to find that 
the estate of Paul Ross is to be di- 
vided among his nearest surviving 
relatives, his three nephews and two 
nieces.” 

There was hubbub in the court- 
room. The relatives all smiled and 
hugged each other. The newsmen 
worked their cameras and recorders. 

The Judge pounded his gavel. 

“This court is not used to such 
uproar,” he said when he could be 
heard. “We’ll have no more of it 
until I have quite finished.” 

I wished I were gone. 

“It is within the province of this 
court to direct that the estate first 



settle debts of the deceased before 
the settlement to the heirs and to 
honor the last wishes of the de- 
ceased.” 

The nieces and nephews shrug- 
ged. 

The show is almost over with 
now. Even if it’s a year late, this is 
Mr. Ross’s show. He wanted it. He 
planned it. He built the little rock- 
ets and fitted their interiors with 
all their beauty and fineness. 

Now / send off “Spring Rain’’ 
and the sky fills with sparkling elec- 
trical droplets. 

There is just one more cannister 
left and there are tears in my eyes 
again. 

The relatives. Surely, they're 
watching this from Earth. Everyone 
else is. I hope they’re finally realiz- 
ing that Mr. Ross was more than 
Just Tommy’s braces and those 
other things they wanted. 

The crates of cannisters weighed 
a lot. But there was still a lot of 
money left after their shipping 
charges were paid. Mr. Ross had 
planned to use that money to live 
on. 

The last cannister is marked 
“Friendship.” There are so many 
tears in my eyes now that / have to 
feel for the button that sets it off. 

/ think how the judge smiled 
when / told him how much Mr. 
Ross had wanted to be buried on 
the Moon. 

The lead-lined casket and vault 
were very, very heavy and wonder- 
fully expensive to ship. ★

GALAXY 



Editorial 



THE GOLDEN AGE 

“You’ve got to be a believer!” 

— D.D. Harriman in “The Man Who Sold the Moon” 






n<DiTiNG A SCIENCE-FICTION mag- 
azine is more than a job. It is a vo- 
cation. 

Oh, there have been those who 
treated it as just a job. But they 
generally haven’t lasted very long, 
nor have they been long remem- 
bered. Only those who have shown 
a genuine love for science fiction 
have been honored in its annals. 

One might assume that being 
chosen to edit GALAXY would be 
an occasion of great pride and satis- 
faction to the one so honored. And 
it is. But that pride and satisfaction 
is mixed with more than a little 
humility. It is impossible to stand in 
the company of such great pred- 
ecessors as H.L. Gold and Fred- 
erik Pohl and Jim Baen and not 
feel humility. 

As editor of GALAXY, I know 
that whatever success I may achieve 
will depend not only on doing a job 
well in the ordinary sense of the 
word, but on living up to the duties 
demanded only of a science-fiction 
editor. 

A science-fiction editor, unlike 



editors in many another field, can 
never depend entirely on knowledge 
or attitudes developed in the past. 
He has a responsibility to know 
how science fiction is developing as 
a genre, to contribute as best he can 
to furthering that development, to 
perceive new literary frontiers and 
recognize and encourage the writers 
who explore them. 

Most forms of popular literature 
are static forms. Westerns, detective 
stories, gothic romances and the 
like have been written in pretty 
much the same way for decades, 
even for generations. However well 
they say it, they rarely have any- 
thing new to say. 

But science fiction is an evolving 
form of literature. Like other forms, 
it has its roots in the past — as far 
back as (take your pick) H.G. 
Wells, Jules Verne or Mary Shel- 
ley. But it is never completely 
bound by the past. No sooner do 
mainstream critics complain that 
“science has caught up with science 
fiction” than sf breaks out in en- 
tirely new directions. 



157 




Many people think of literary 
evolution only in terms of literary 
techniques — old wine in new bot- 
tles. But the strength of science fic- 
tion, much as it has benefited from 
advances in style and narrative, has 
always been in its thematic evolu- 
tion. It is the literature of man in re- 
lation to change, and as human so- 
ciety itself evolves, the number of 
imaginable futures multiplies. We 
must learn to assimilate not only 
new possibilities, but new attitudes 
about those possibilities. 

People look on science fiction as 
entertainment, and it is. But it is en- 
tertainment for people who think. In 
what other branch of popular litera- 
ture could there be an audience for 
a novel like Ursula K. LeGuin’s 
The Dispossessed, the first utopian 
novel that is really a novell Where 
else but in a magazine like 
GALAXY would readers take in 
their stride the strange customs and 
moralities that are normal in the fu- 
ture imagined by John Varley? 

Among some older readers of 
science fiction, there is still talk of 
the Golden Age of the 1940’s, 
when under the late John W. 
Campbell, the genre first began to 
take itself seriously — and win the 
beginnings of serious recognition. 

But the Golden Age is really 
now. More people are reading sci- 
ence fiction than ever before, and 
they have better science fiction to 
read than ever before. The growing 
acceptance of sf and the increasing 
quality of writing in the genre are 



even more important than the 
much-publicized college courses. 

And the best is perhaps yet to be. 
Last month in these pages, two re- 
viewers offered contrasting reactions 
to Star Wars. One called it an imag- 
inative breakthrough in science- 
fiction movies; the other a cliche- 
ridden space opera. Both were 
right. The movie was a space opera 
right out of the 1930’s — but look at 
what the space operas of the 1930’s 
led to. 

Today we have millions of view- 
ers willing to accept a world with 
double suns, bizarre aliens that are 
not meant to be merely frightening, 
a vast Galactic Empire in which 
Earth (if it exists) is too insignifi- 
cant to be mentioned. Tomorrow 
these viewers will be ready for 
Dune or The City and the Stars or 
Way Station or The Left Hand of 
Darkness. 

How strange it seems that barely 
ten years ago James Blish still 
warned against “incest” — the men- 
tion of science fiction in a science- 
fiction story, as if sf were a part of 
human culture, worthy of notice 
outside its (then) small readership. 
Science fiction is part of our culture 
now. Very flattering — but also a bit 
unsettling for those who take seri- 
ously both science fiction and its 
impact on human consciousness. 

Be that as it may, the Golden 
Age of science fiction is here — and 
GALAXY intends to be part of it; 
as much a part as a new but deter- 
mined editor can make it. — j-j p-

If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they'll be shipped automatically. 
If you don’t want a Selection, or prefer 
an Alternate, or no book at all, just fill 
out the convenient form always provided, 
and return it to us by the date specified.

10 days, and receive an unwanted Selec- 
tion, you may return it at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Selec- 
tions or Alternates during the coming 
year. You may resign any time thereafter, 
or remain a member as long as you wish.

month is only $1.98 plus shipping and 
handling. Other extra-value Selections are 
slightly higher but always much less than
