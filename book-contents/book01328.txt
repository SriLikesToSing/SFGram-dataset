TALK, TALK, TALK 



O nce upon a time we were noted 
for making pronounoemeints 
about what writers ireally ishould be 
d<oing with their (time. ''There are 
two kinds of writers,” we used to 
say. "The kind who write, and the 
kind who talk. The kind who talk 
are a lot wittier and brighter and 
better company; but the kind who 
write are the ones to pay attention 
to — after all, that’s the name of 
the game.” And then we smugly 
pointed out that we were The Kind 
Who Wrote. 

Candor compels us to announce 
that this is no longer entirely true. 
Over the past few years we’ve been 
dolntg a whale of la lot of talking — 
on radio and on television, to fan 
groups and scientific groups and 
management associations and liter- 
ary clubs and churches and temples 
and . well, you name it, we’ve 
done it, our motto has become. Have

your time with in these pages, but 
it has its interesting aspects. You 
know — what in the world does a 
science-fiction writer have to say 
to, for instance, the American Man- 
agement Association or the Porce- 
lain Enamel Institute? 

G lad you asked the question. 
Here’s the answer: 

What we tell the various business, 
professional and other groups is 
basically a sort of science-fiction 
story. We start with what is now 
happening in science and society; 
we extrapolate with a free hand; 
and we show what the world may 
be like for them, and for all of us, 
over the next few decades or cen- 
turies. • 

Essentially what we tell them is a 
science-fiction story without plot or 
characters. And most of the time 
there is a discussion period, or at 
least a few questions passed up by

THE 

SOFT WEAPON 

by LARRY NIVEN 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



The Outsiders were a billion years 
dead, but some of their weaponry 
survived — and could destroy Man! 



1 

L ogically Jason Papandreou should 
have taken the Court Jester 
straight home to Jinx. But — 

He’d seen a queer star once. 
He’d been single then, a gunner 
volunteer on one of Earth’s war- 



ships during the last stages of the 
last kzinti war. The war had been 
highly imequal in Earth’s favor. 
Kzinti fight gallantly and fero- 
ciously and with no concept of 
mercy, and they always take on 
several times as much as they can 
handle. 



6 





Earth’s ships had pushed the 
kzinti back out of human space, 
then pushed a little further, an- 
nexing two kzinti worlds for puni- 
tive damages. The fleets had turned 
for home. But Jason’s captain had 
altered course to give his crew what 
might be their last chance to see 
Beta Lyrae. 

Now, decades later, Jason, his wife 
and their single alien passenger were 
rattling around in a ship built for 
ten times their number. Anne-Marie’s 
curiosity was driving her up the 
walls with the frustration of not 
being able to open the stasis box 
in the forward locker. Nessus the 
mad puppeteer had taken to spend- 
ing all his time in his room, hover- 
ing motionless and morose between 
the sleeping pjates. Jinx was still 
several weeks away. 

Clearly a diversion was in order. 

Beta Lyrae. A six degree shift 
in course would do it. 

A nne-Marie glared at the locker 
containing the stasis box. “Isn’t 
there any way to open it?** 

Jason didn’t answer. His whole at- 
tention was on the mass indicator, 
the transparent ball in which a green 
radial line was growing toward the 
surface. Growing and splitting. 
“Jay?” 

“We can’t open it, Anne. We 
don’t have the equipment to break 
a stasis field. It’s illegal anyway.” 
Almost time. The radial double 
line must not grow too long. When 
a working hyperdrive gets too deep 
into a gravity well, it disappears. 

“Think they’ll tell us what’s in- 
side?” 



“Sure, unless it’s a new weapon.” 

“With oiu* luck it will be. Jay, 
nobody’s ever found a stasis box 
that shape before. It’s bound to be 
something new. The Institute is 
likely to sit on it for years and 
years. — Whup! Jay, what are 
you doing?" 

“Dropping out of hyperspace.” 

“You might warn a lady.” She 
wrapped both arms around her mid- 
section, apparently making sure 
everything was still there. 

“Lady, why don’t you have a look 
out that side window?” 

“What for?” 

Jason merely looked smug. His 
wife, knowing she would get no 
other answer, got up and undogged 
the cover. It was not unusual for 
a pilot to drop-out in the depths 
of interstellar space. Weeks of look- 
ing at the blind-spot appearance of 
hyperspace could wear on the best 
of nerves. 

She stood at the window, a tall, 
slender brunette in a glowing green 
falling jumper. A Wunderlander she 
had been, of the willowy low-gravity 
type rather than the fat, balloon- 
like low-gravity type, until Jason 
Papandreou had dropped out of the 
sky to add her to his collection of 
girls in every port. It hadn’t worked 
out that way. In the first year of 
marriage she had learned space and 
the Court Jester inside out, until she 
was doubly indispensable. Jay, Anne, 
Jester, all one independent organism. 

And she thought she’d seen every- 
thing. But she hadn’t seen this! 
Grinning, Jason waited for her re- 
action. 

“Jay, it’s gorgeous! What is it?” 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



7 




Jason moved up to circle iher 
waist with one arm. She’d put on 
wei^t in the last year, muscle 
weighty [from moving in heavier 
gravities. He looked out around her 
shoulder . and thought of smoke. 

There was smoke across the sky, 
a trail of red smoke wound in a 
tight spiral coil. At the center of 
the coil was the source of the fire. 
A double star. One member was 
violet-white, a flame to brand holes 
in a human retina, its force held 
in check by the polarized window. 
The companion was small and yel- 
low. They seemed to burn inches 
apart, so close that their masses 
had pulled them both into flattened 
eggs, so close that a red belt of 
lesser flame looped around them 
to link their bulging equators to- 
gether. The belt was hydrogen, still 
mating in fusion fire, pulled loose 
from the stellar surfaces by two gra- 
vitational wells in conflict. 

The gravity war did more than 
that. It sent a loose end of the red 
belt flailing away, away and out 
in a burning maypole spiral that ex- 
panded from flame-red to smoke- 
red, bracketing the sky and paint- 
ing a spiral path of stars deep red 
across half the universe. 

“They call it Beta Lyrae,” said 
Jason. “I was here once before, 
back when I was free and happy. 
Mph. Hasn’t changed much.” 

“Well, nor 

“Now don’t you take all this for 
granted. How long do you think 
those twins can keep throwing hydro- 
gen away? I give it a million years, 
and then, pft! No more Beta Ly- 
rac.” 



’’Pity. We’d better hurry and wake 
Nessus before it disappears.” 

T he being they called Nessus 
would not have opened his door 
for them. 

Puppeteers were gregarious even 
among alien species. They’d had 
to be. For at least tens of thousands 
of years the puppeteers had ruled 
a trade empire which included all 
the races within the sixty-^light-year 
sphere men called Known Space 
and additional unknown regions 
whose extent could not be guessed. 
As innate cowards the puppeteers 
had to get along with everyone. And 
Nessus too was usually gregarious. 
But Nessus was mad. 

Nessus was cursed with courage. 
In a puppeteer courage is a symp- 
tom of insanity. As usual there 
were other symptoms, other peri- 
pheral indications of the central dis- 
order. Nessus was now in the de- 
pressive stage of a manic-depressive 
cycle. 

Luckily the depression had not 
hit him until his business with the 
Outsiders was over. In the manic 
stage he had been fun. He had 
spent every night in a different state- 
room. He had charcoal-drawn car- 
toons which now hung in the astro- 
gation room, cartoons which Jason 
could hardly believe were drawn by 
a puppeteer. Humor is generally 
linked to an interrupted defense 
mechanism. Puppeteers weren’t sup- 
posed to have a sense of humor. 
But now Nessus spent all his time 
in one room. He wanted to see 
nobody. There was one thing he 
might open his door for.

IF 




Jason moved to the control board 
and pushed the panic button. 

The alarm was a repeated re- 
cording of a woman’s scream. It 
should have brought the puppeteer 
galloping in as if the angel of death 
were at his heel. But he trotted 
through the door seconds later than 
he should have. His flat, brainless 
heads surveyed the control room 
for signs of damage. 

The first man to see a puppeteer 
had done so during a Campish re- 
vival of Time for Beany reruns. 
He had come running back to the 
scout ship, breathless and terrified, 
screaming, ‘Take off! The planet’s 
full of monsters!” 

“Whatta they look like?” 

“Like a three-legged centaur with 
two Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent 
puppets on its hands, and no head.” 
“Take a pill, Pierson. You’re 
drunk.” 

Pierson’s Puppeteer is a senti- 
ent herbivore whose brain is housed 
in a bony bulge between the two 
long, flexible necks. The heads at 
the ends of those necks are mostly 
jaws, furnished with flexible lips 
and tongues. If a man had jaw- 
muscle strength in his grip and 
the senses of taste and smell in 
his fingertips, his hands would 
be as good at tool-building as a 
puppeteer’s mouth. A flowing brown 
mane covers the cranial bulge and 
runs in a strip along the spine to 
the hind hip. 

Nessus was an atypical puppeteer. 
His mane was straggly and unkept. 
It should have been twisted, brushed 
and tied in a manner to show his 
status in puppeteer society. But it 



showed no status at all. Perhaps 
thiift was appropriate. There was no 
puppeteer society. The puppeteers 
had apparently left the galaxy en 
masse some twelve years ago, leav- 
ing behind only their insane and 
their genetically deficient. 

“What is wrong?” asked Nessus. 
“There’s nothing wrong,” said 
Jason. 

Anne-Marie said, “Have a look 
out the window. This window.” 

T heir employer obediently moved 
to the window. He happened 
to stop just next to one of the car- 
toons he’d drawn while in the manic 
phase, and Jason, looking from the 
puppeteer to the cartoon, found it 
more difficult than ever to associate 
the two. 

The cartoon showed two hiunan 
gods. Only the lighting and the pro- 
portions showed that they were gods. 
Otherwise they were as individually 
human as a very good human artist 
could have drawn them. One, a 
child just about to become a teen- 
ager, was holding the galaxy in his 
hands. He wore a very strange grin 
as he looked down at the glowing 
multicolored spiral. The other fig- 
ure, a disgruntled patriarch with 
flowing white hair and beard, was 
saying, “All right, now that you’ve 
had your little joke ...” 

Nessus claim^ it was an attempt 
to imitate human humor. Maybe. 
Would an insane puppeteer develop 
a sense of humor? 

Nessus (his real name sounded 
like a car crash set to music) was 
insane. There were circumstances un- 
der which he would actually risk his

life. But the sudden puppeteer exodus 
bad left a m)o*iad of broken promises 
made to a dozen sentient races. The 
puppeteers had left Nessus and his 
fellow exiles with money to straight- 
en things out. So Nessus had rented 
the Court Jestery rented all twelve 
staterooms, and gone out to the 
furthest edge of known space to 
deal with a ship of the Outsiders. 

“I recognize this star,” he said 
now. “Amazing. I really should 
have suggested this stop myself. Had 
I not been so depressed I certainly 
would have. Thank you, Jason.” 
“My pleasure, sir.” Jason Papan- 
dreou really sounded like he’d in- 
vented the gaudy display just to 
cheer up a down-in-the-mouths pup- 
peteer. Nessus cocked a sardonic 
head at him, and he hastily added, 
“We’ll be on our way again when- 
ever you’re ready.” 

“I’ll scan with deep-radar,” Anne- 
Marie said helpfully. 

Jason laughed. “Can you imagine 
how many ships must have scanned 
this system already?” 

“Just for luck.” 

A moment later there was a Beep. 
Anne-Marie yelped. 

Jason said, “I don’t believe it.” 
“Two in one trip!” his wife car- 
ed. “Jay, that’s some sort of 
ecord!” 

It was. Using deep-radar had been 
more of a habit than anything else. 
A deepHTadar on high setting was an 
easy way to find Slaver stasis boxes, 
since 0^7 stasis fields and neutron 
stars woidd reflect a hyperwave 
pulse. But Beta Lyrae must have 
been searched many times before. 
Searching was traditional. 



Nessus turned from the window. 
“I suggest that we locate the box, 
then leave it. You may send a 
friend for it.” 

Jason stared. “Leave it? Are you 
kidding?” 

“It is an anomaly. Such a box 
should have been found long since. 
It has no reason to be here in the 
first place. Beta Lyrae probably did 
not exist a billion and a half years 
ago. Why then would the Slavers 
have come here?” 

“War. They might have been 
running from a tnuctip fleet.” 

Anne-Marie was sweeping the 
deep-radar in a narrow beam, fol- 
lowing the smoky spiral, searching 
for the tiny node of stasis her first 
pulse had found. 

“You hired my ship,” Jason said 
abruptly, “If you order me to go 
on, I’ll do it.” 

“I will not. Your species has come 
a long way in a short time. If you 
do not have prudence, you have 
some workable susbstitute.” 

“There it is,” said Anne-Marie. 
“Look, Jay. A little icy blob of a 
world a couple of billion miles out.” 

Jason looked. “Shouldn’t be any 
problem. All right. I’ll take us 
down.” 

Nessus said nothing. He seemed 
alert enough, but without nervous- 
ness and general excitability that 
woidd have meant the onset of his 
manic stage. At least Beta Lyrae had 
cured his depression.

outside her hexagonal ports. In lieu 
of sight her crew used a mechanical 
sense like a cross between radar 
and X-ray vision. The universe show- 
ed on her screens as a series of 
transparent images superimposed: a 
shadow show. 

Four kzinti watched a blob- 
shaped image sink slowly through 
other images, come to a stop at a 
point no different from any other. 

“Ohuft-Captain, they’re down,” 
said Flyer. 

“Of course they’re down.” Chuft- 
Captain spoke without heat. “Tele- 
path, how many are there?” 

‘Two human.” There was a quiet, 
self-hating resignation in the Tele- 
path’s speech. His tone became dis- 
gust as he added, “And a pup- 
peteer.” 

“Odd. That’s a passenger ship. A 
puppeteer couldn’t need all that 
room.” 

“I sense only their presence, Ohuft- 
Captain.” Telepath was pointedly 
reminding him that he had not yet 
taken the drug. He would do so only 
if ordered. Without an injection of 
treated extract of sthondat lymph 
his powers were low. Little more 
than the knack for making an ac- 
curate guess. 

“One human has left the ship,” 
said Flyer. “No, two humans.” 

“Slaverstudent, initiate hostilities. 
Assume the puppeteer will stay safe- 
ly inside.” 

T he planet was no bigger than 
Earth’s moon. Her faint hydro- 
gen atmosphere must have been reg- 
ularly renewed as the spiral streamer 
whipped across her orbit. She was 



in the plane of the hydrogen spiral, 
which now showed as a glowing red 
smoke trail cutting the night sky 
into two unequal parts. 

Anne-Marie finished tucking her 
hair into her helmet, clamped the 
helmet to her neck ring, and stepped 
out to look around. 

“I dub thee Cue Ball,” she said. 

“Cute,” said Jason. ‘Too bad if 
she’s named already.” 

They moved through the ship’s 
pressure curtain, Jason toting a bulky 
portable deep-radar. The escalladder 
carried them down into the ice. 

They moved away, following the 
dark image in the deep-radar screen. 
Jason was a head shorter than his 
wife and twice as wide; his typical 
Earther’s build looked almost Jinxian 
next to hers. He moved easily in the 
low gravity. Anne-Marie, bouncing 
like a rubber clown, kept pace with 
him only by dint of longer legs and 
greater effort. 

Jason was standing right over the 
image of the stasis box, getting ready 
to mark the ice so they could dig 
for it, when the image vanished. 

The crack! jerked his head around. 
He saw a cloud of steam explode 
into the near-vacuum, a cloud lit 
from below by a rosy light. Anne- 
Marie was already sprinting for the 
ship in low flying leaps. He turned 
to follow. 

A form like a big, roly-poly man 
shot through the light into what 
must by then have been a cloud of 
tiny ice crystals. It was a kzin in 
a vac suit, and the thing in its ihand 
was a police stunner. It landed run- 
ning. Under the conditions its aim 
was inhumanly accurate.

Jason collapsed like a deflating name. Had he not been alone with 
balloon. Anne-Marie was pin-wheel- the prisoners he would have been

“You may call me Captain. De-

“Jason Papandreou, of Earth ori-

perhaps to a point at himself, and 
found the electronic police web 
binding him in an invisible grip. He 
finished the introductions without 
gestures. 

“Very well,” said Chuft-Captain. 
“Jason, are you in possession of a

screen behind the prisoners. Tele- 
path nodded and switched off. The 
prisoner had lied; it was now per- 
missible to bring in help to ques- 
tion him. 

It had been a strange, waiting 
kind of war. 

Legally it was no war at all. The 
Traitofs Claw showed in the Kzin 
records as a stolen ship. If she had 
been captured at any time, all the 
kzin worlds would have screamed 
loudly for Chuft-Captain’s head as 
a pirate. Even the ship’s name had 
been chosen for that eventuality. 

There had never been a casualty; 
never, until now, a victory. A strange 
war, in which the rules were flexible 
and the dictates of personal honor 
were often hard to define and to 
satisfy. Even now . What does 
one do with a captured puppeteer? 
You couldn’t eat him; puppeteers

were officially a friendly power. 

A strange war — but better than 
no war at all. Perhaps it would now 
get better still. 

T he kzin had asked one question 
and turned away. A bad sign. 
Apparently the question had been 
a formality .... 

Jason wriggled once more against 
the force field. He was embedded 
like a fly in flypaper. It must be 
a police web. Since the last war 
the kzinti worlds had been living 
in probationary status. Though they 
might possess and use police restraint 
devices, they were allowed no 
weapons of war. 

Against two unarmed humans and 
a puppeteer, they hardly needed 
them. 

Anne-Marie stirred. Jason said, 
“Easy, honey.” 

“Easy? Oh, my neck. What hap- 
pened?” She tried to move her 
arm. Her head, above the soft grip 
of the police web, jerked up in sur- 
prise; her eyes widened. And she 
saw the kzin. 

She screamed. 

The kzin watched in obvious ir- 
ritation. Nessus merely watched. 

“All right*' said Jason. ^"That 
won’t do us any good.” 

“Jay, they’re kzinti!** 

“Right. And they’ve got us. Oh, 
hell, go ahead and scream.” 

That shocked her. She looked at 
him long enough to read his help- 
lessness, then turned back to the 
kziji. Already she was calmer. Jason 
didn’t have to worry about his wife’s 
courage. He’d seen it tested before. 
She had never seen a kzin; all 



she knew about them she had heard 
from Jason, and little of that had 
been good. But she was no xeno- 
phobe. There was more sympathy 
of feeling between Anne-Marie and 
Nessus than there was between Nes- 
sus and Jason. She could face the 
kzin. 

But he couldn’t read the puppe- 
teer’s expression. It was Nessus he 
was worried about. Puppeteers hated 
pain worse than they feared death. 
Let the kzin threaten Nessus with 
pain and there was no telling what 
he’d do. Without the puppeteer they 
might have a chance to conceal the 
stasis box. 

It might be very bad if the kzinti 
got into a stasis box. 

A billion and a half years ago 
there had been a war. The Sla- 
vers, who controlled most of the 
galaxy at the time, had also con- 
trolled most of the galaxy’s sentient 
species. One such slave species, 
the tnuctipun, had at last revolted 
The Slavers had had a power like 
telepathic hypnosis, a power -that 
could control the mind of any sen- 
tient being. The tnuctipun slaves 
had possessed high intelligence, high- 
er technology and a slyness more 
terrifying than any merely mental 
power. Slave'rs and tnuctipun slaves 
alike, and every sentient being then 
in the galaxy, had died in that war. 

Scattered through known and un- 
known space were the relics of that 
war, waiting to be found by species 
which had become sentient since the 
war’s end. The Slavers had left 
stasis boxes, containers in stasis 
fields which had survived unchanged 
through a billion and a half years

of time. The tnuctipun had left mu- 
tated remnants of their biological 
engineering: the frumious bander- 
snatch of Jinx’s shorelines, the stage 
trees which were to 'be found on 
worlds scattered all across known 
space, the tiny cold-world sunflowers 
with their rippling reflective blos- 
soms. 

Stasis boxes were rare and dan- 
gerous. Often they held abandoned 
Slaver weapons. One such weapon, 
the variable-sword, had recently rev- 
olutionized human society, bringing 
back swordplay and dueling on many 
worlds. Another was being used for 
peaceful ends; the disintegrator was 
too slow to make a good weapon. 
If the kzinti found a new weapon, 
and if it were good enough. 

r ieir kzinti captor was a big one, 
thought Jason, though even a 
small one was a big one. He stood 
eight feet tall, as erect as a human 
on his short hind legs. The orange 
shade of his fur might have been 
inconspicuous to a kzin’s natural 
prey, but to human eyes it blazed 
like neon. He was thick all over, 
arms, legs, torso; he might have 
been a very fat cat dipped in orange 
dye, with certain alterations. You 
would have had to discount the nak- 
ed pink ratlike tail, the strangely 
colored irises which were round in- 
stead of slitted, and especially the 
head, rendered nearly triangular by 
the large cranial bulge, more than 
large enough to hold a human brain. 

“The trap you stumbled into is 
an old one,” said, the kzin. “One 
ship or another has been waiting 
on this world since the last war. We 



have 'been searching out Slaver stasis 
boxes for much longer than that, 
hoping to find new weapons.” 

A door opened, and a second kzin 
entered. It stayed there in the dilated 
doorway, waiting for the leader’s 
attention. There was something about 
its appearance — 

“But only recently did we hit 
upon this idea. You may know,” 
said their orange captor, “that ships 
often stop off to see this unusual 
star. Ships of most species also 
have the habit of sending a deep- 
radar pulse around every star they 
happen across. No student of Shav- 
ers has ever found method behind 
the random dispersion of stasis box- 
es throughout this region of space. 

“Several decades ago we did find 
a stasis box. Unfortunately it con- 
tained nothing useful, but we event- 
ually found out how to turn the 
stasis field on and off. It made good 
bait for a trap. For forty Kzin years 
we have waited for ships to happen 
by with stasis boxes in their holds. 
You are our second catch.” 

“You’d have done better finding 
your own boxes,” said Jason. He 
had been examining the silent kzin. 
This one was smaller than ^eir 
interrogator. His fur was matted. 
His tail drooped, as did his pointed 
ears. For a kzin the beast was skin- 
ny, and misery showed in his eyes. 
As certainly as they were aboard 
a fighting ship, this was not a fight- 
ing kzin. 

‘We would have been seen. Earth 
would have acted to stop our search.” 
Apparently dismissing the subject, 
their interrogator turned to Ihe 
smaller kzin and spat out an imita- 



THE SOFT WEAPON

tion of cats fighting. The smaller 
kzin turned to face them. 

A pressure took hold of Jason’s 
mind and devdoped into a sudden 
^tting headache. 

He had expected it. It was a 
strange thing, hut — put a sane 
alien next to an insane one, and 
usually you could tell them apart. 
And kzinti were much closer to 
human than were any other spe- 
cies; so close that they must at 
one time have had common microbe 
ancestors. This smaller kzin was 
obviously half crazy. And he wasn’t 
a fighter. To be in this place at 
this time, he had to be a trained 
telepath, a forced addict of the 
kzinti drug that sent nine himdred 
and ninety-nine of out a thousand 
kainti insane and left the survivor 
a shivering neurotic. 

He concentrated on remembering 
the taste of a raw carrot. Just to 
be difficult. 

Ill 

^^depath sagged against a wall, 
A utterly spent. He could still 
taste yellow root munched between 
flat-topped teeth. Chuft-Captain 
watched without sympadiy, waiting. 

He forced (himself to speak. 
“Chuft-Captain, they have not hid- 
den the stasis box. It may be 
found in a locker to the left of the 
control room.** 

Chuft-Captain turned to the wall 
screen. “See to it. And get the 
puppeteer’s pressure suit. Then seal 

the ship.** 

Flyer and Slaverotiident acknowl- 
edged and dgned off.

“The relic. Where’d they; find it?” 
“Chuft-Captain, they did not. The 
stasis box was found in deep in- 
terstellar space, considerably closer 
to the Core, by a ship of Ae Out- 
siders. The Outsiders kept it to 
trade in known space.” 

“What business did the prisoners 
have with the Outsiders?” 

“The puppeteer had business with 
them. It merely used die humans 
for transportation. The humans do 
not know what business it was.” 
Chuft-Captain spat in reflex fury, 
but of course he could not ask a 
kzin to read the mind of a herbi- 
vore. Telepath wouldn’t, and would 
have to be disciplined; or he would, 
and would go insane. Nor could 
Chuft-Captain use pain on the pup- 
peteer. He would get the informa- 
tion if it was worthless; but if the 
puppeteer decided it was valuable, it 
would commit suicide. 

“Am I to assume that the Out- 
siders did in fact sell die relic to 
the prisoners?” 

“Chuft-Captain, they did. The 
sum was a puppeteer’s recorded 
word of honor for fourteen million 
stars in human money.” 

“A lordly sum.” 

“Perhaps more than lordly. 
Chuft-Captain, you may know that 
the Outsiders are long4ived. The 
male human has speculated that they 
intend to return in one or more 
thousands of years, when die re- 
cording of a puppeteer’s voice is an 
antique worth eights of times its 
face value.” 

“Urrr. I shouldn’t stray into such 
byways, but — are they really that 
long-lived?” 



IF 




**Chuft-Captain, the Outsider ship 
was following a starseed in order 
to trace its migratory pattern.” 
•‘Urrr-rrrl” Starseeds lived long 
enough to make mating migrations 
from the galactic core to ^e rim 
and 'back, moving at average speeds 
estimated at point eight lights. 

A patterned knock. The others en- 
tered, wearing pressure " suits with 
the helmets thrown back. Flyer car- 
ried the puppeteer’s pressure suit, 
a three-legged balloon with padded 
mittens for the mouths, small 
clawed boots, an extra bulge for a 
food pouch and a hard, padded 
shield to cover the cranial hump. 
Slaverstudent carried a cylinder with 
a grip-notched handle. Its entire sur- 
face was a perfectly reflecting mir- 
ror: the sign of Ae Slaver stasis 
field. 

The prisoners, the human ones, 
were silently glaring. Their post- 
telepathy headaches had not helped 
their dispositions. Telepath was 
resting from the aftereffects of the 
drug. 

“Open it,” said Chuft-Captain. 

Slaverstudent removed an empty 
cubical box from the table, set the 
stasis box in its place and touched 
a pressure-sensitive surface at the 
table’s edge. The cylinder ceased 
to be a distorting mirror. It was a 
bronzy metal box which popped 
open of its own accord. 

The kzin called Slaverstudent 
reached in and brought out: 

A silvered bubble six inches in 
diameter, with a sculptured handle 
attached. The handle would not have 
fit any gripping appendage Chuft- 
Capvtain knew of. 



A cube of law meat in some- 
thing like a plastic sandwich wrap. 

A hand. An alien hand lurmshed 
with three massive, clumsynlooldng 
fingers set like a mechanical grid). 
It had 'been dipped in something 
that formed a clear, hard coating. 
One thick finger wore a chronometer. 

44 A bad thing has happened,” 
said Nessus. 

The kzin who had opened the box 
seemed terribly excited. He turned 
the preserved hand over and over, 
yowrling in kzinti. Then he put it 
down and picked up the bubble- 
with-a-handle. 

“Let me guess,” said Jason. 
“That’s not a Slaver box. It’s a 
tnuctipun box.” 

“Yes. The first to be found. The 
handle on the bubble tool is ad- 
mirably designed to fit a tnuctip 
hand. The preserved Slaver must 
be a trophy — I am quoting the stu- 
dent of Slavers. Jason, this may 
be a disaster. The tnuctipun were 
master technologists.” 

The “student of Slavers” was run- 
ning his padded, retractile-clawed 
hands over the sphere-with-a-handie. 
No detail at aH. showed on the 
sphere; it was the same mirror- 
color as the stasis field which had 
disgorged it. The handle was bron- 
zy metal. There were grooves for 
six fingers and two long, opposed 
thumbs; there was a button set in 
an awkward position. A deep, 
straight groove ran down the side, 
with a guide and nine notched set- 
tings. 

Anne-Marie spoke in a low voice. 
“Looks like the handle of a gun.” 



THE SOFT WEAPON

“We need information,” said Ja- 
son. “Nessus, is that higger kzin the 
boss? The one who speaks In- 
terworld?” 

“Yes. The one with the bubble 
tool is a student of the Slaver Em- 
pire. The one with the white stripe 
is the pilot. The mind reader is 
resting. We need not fear him for 
several hours.” 

“But the boss kzin understands 
Interworld. Do the others?” 

I think not. Your inaptly named 
Interworld is difficult for non- 
humans to learn and to pronounce.” 
“Good. Anne, how are you do- 
ing?” 

“I’m scared. We’re in big trou- 
ble, aren’t we, Jay?” 

“We are. No sense fooling our- 
selves. Any ideas?” 

“You know me, Jay. In a pinch 
I usually know who to call for 
help. The integrator if the house 
stops, the taxi company when a 
transfer booth doesn’t work. Step 
into an autodoc when you feel 
sick. If your lift belt fails you 
diel E for Emergency on your pock- 
et phone. If someone answers be- 
fore you hit the ground, scream.” 
She tried a smile. “Jay? Who do 
we call about Ikzinti kidnappings?” 
He smiled back. “You write a 
forceful note to the Patriarch of 
Kzin. Right, Nessus?” 

“Also you threaten to cut off 
trade. Do not worry too much, 
Anne-Marie. My species is expert 
at staying alive.” 

^ Tndoubtedly a weapon,” said 
^ Slaverstudent. “We had 
best try it outside.” 



“Later/’ ordered Chuft-Gaptain. 
Again Slaverstudent dipped' into 
the cylindrical box. He removed 
small containers half filled with 
two kinds of small-arms projectiles; 
a colored cap which might easily 
have fitted a standard bowling ball; 
a transparent bulb of clear fluid; 
and a small metal widget that might 
have been anything. “I see no open- 
ings for bullets.” 

“Nor do I. Flyer, take a sample 
of this meat and find out what it 
is made of. Do the same with this 
— trophy, and this bulb. Telepath, 
are you awake?” 

“Chuft-Captain, I am.” 

“When can you again read the — ” 
“Ohuft-Captain, please don’t make 
me — ” 

“At ease. Telepath. Take time to 
recover. But I intend to keep the 
prisoners present while we investi- 
gate this find. They may notice 
some detail we miss. Eventually I 
will need you.” 

“Yes, Ohuft-Captain.” 

“Test that small implement for 
radio or hyperwave emissions. Do 
nothing else to it. It has the look 
of a subminiature communicator, 
but it might be anything, a camera, 
even an explosive.” 

“Slaverstudent, you will come 
with me. We are going outside.” 

I t took several minutes for the 
kzinti to get the prisoners into 
their suits, adjust their radios so 
that everybody could hear every- 
body else, and move them through 
the double-door airlock. 

To Jason the airlock was further 
proof that this was a warship. A 



18 



IF 




pressure curtain was generally more 
convenient dian an airlock; but if 
power failed during a battle, all the 
air could leave the ship in one whoof . 
Warships carried double doors. 

Two stunners followed them up 
the sloping ice tunnel. Jason had 
thought there would be four. He’d 
need to fight only the boss kzin and 
one other. But both carried stun- 
ners and both seemed alert. 

He took too much time deciding. 
The boss made Nessus stand on 
a flexible wire grid, then did the 
same with Anne-Marie and Jason. 
The grid was a portable police web, 
and it was as inflexibly restraining 
as the built-in web in the ship. 

The kzinti returned down the 
sloping tunnel, leaving Jason, Anne- 
Marie and Nessus to enjoy the view. 

It was a lonely view. The blue 
and yellow stars were rising, in- 
visibly. They showed only as a 
brighter spot at one foot of the 
red-smoke arch of hydrogen. Stars 
showed space-jbright in curdled pat- 
terns across the sky; they all glowed 
red near the arch. The land was 
cold, rock-hard ice, rippling in long, 
low undulations that might have 
been seasonal snowdrifts millions of 
years ago, when the Lyrae twins 
were bigger and brighter. Black 
faceted rocks poked through some 
of the high spots. 

Several yards away was the Court 
Jester, A thick, round-edged, flat- 
bottomed disk, she sat on the ice 
like a painted concrete building. 
Apparently she intended to stay. 

Jason stood at parade rest on the 
police web. Anne-Marie was six 
inches to his right, facing him. For 



ah of urge to touch her, she 
might have been miles away. 

Two days ago she had carefully 
painted her eyelids with semi- 
permanent tattoo. They showed as 
two tiny black-and-white-checked 
racing victory flags, rippling when 
she blinked. Their gaiety mocked 
her drawn face. 

‘T wonder why we’re still alive,” 
she said. 

Nessus’ accentless voice was tiny 
in the earphones. “The captain wants 
our opinion on the putative weapon. 
He will not ask for them, but will 
take them through the telepafh.” 
“That doesn’t apply to you, does 
it?” 

“No. No kzin would read my 
mind. Perhaps no kzin would kill 
me; my race holds strong policies 
on the safety of individual mem- 
bers. In any case we have some 
time.” 

“Time for what?” 

“Anne-Marie, we must wait. If 
the artifact is a weapon we must 
recover it. If not, we must survive 
to warn your people that the kzinti 
are searching out Slaver stasis boxes. 
We must wait until we know 
which.” 

“r/ze/i what?” 

“We will find a way.” 

“We,” said Jason. 

“Yes. Our motives coincide here. 

I cannot explain why at this time.” 
But why should a puppeteer risk 
his life, his life, for Earth? Jason 
wondered. 

T he boss kzin emerged from the 
airlock carrying the sphere- 
with-a-handle. He stood before 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



19 




Jason and held it before his eyes. 
**Examine this/’ he oommanded and 
turned it slowly and invitingly in 
his four-'fingered hands. 

There was the reflecting sphere, 
and there was the bronzy-metal gun 
handle with its deeply scored groove 
and its alien sculpturing. The groove 
had nine notched settings running 
from top to bottom, with a guide in 
the top notch. Squiggles which must 
have been tnuctip numbers cor- 
responded to the notches. 

Jason prayed for the police web 
to fail. If he could snatch the arti- 
fact — The Kzin moved away, 
walking uphill to a rise of icy ground. 
A second ikzin emerged from the 
pressure curtain carrying an un- 
familiar gadget of kzinti make. The 
two ikzinti spat phrases at each 
other. Kzinti language always sounds 
like insults. 

Nessus spoke quietly. “The meat 
was protoplasmic, protein and highly 
poisonous. The small, complex 
tnuctip implement does operate in 
hyperspace, but uses no known 
method of communication. The fluid 
in the clear bulb is forty per cent 
hydrogen peroxide, sixty per cent 
hydrogen oxide, purpose unknown.” 

“What’s the Slaver expert car- 
rying?” 

“That is an energy output sensor.” 

The puppeteer seemed calm 
enough. Did he know of some way 
to interrupt a police web? 

Jason couldn’t ask, not when the 
boss kzin could hear every word. 
But he had little h<^. A police 
web belonged to the same family as 
a pilot’s craA field, triggered to 
enfold the pilot when signaled by 



excessive pressure on his crash web- 
bing. A crash web was as deliberate- 
ly foolproof as any last-ditch failsafe 
device. So was a police web. 

Probably the puppeteer was slip- 
ping back into the manic state and 
was now convinced that nothing in 
the universe could harm him. 

Somehow that made Jason’s fail- 
ure worse. “One thing you should 
know, Jason, is that my species 
judges me insane ...” It was one 
of the first things the puppeteer had 
told him. Unable to trust his own 
judgment, Nessus had warned him 
by implication that he would have 
to trust Jason’s. 

They’d both trusted him. 

‘T had to show you Beta Lyrae,” 
he said tdtterly. 

“It was a nice idea, Jay, really 

it was.” 

If he’d been free he’d have found 
a wall and tried to punch it down. 

IV 

C huft-Captain stood on a rise of 
permafrost and let his eyes scan 
the horizon. Those points of dark 
rock would make good targets. 

The weapon was uncomfortable in 
his hand, but he managed to get 
one finger on the presumed trigger 
button. He aimed at the horizon 
and fired. 

Nothing happened. 

He aimed at a closer point, first 
pressing and releasing the trigger 
button repeatedly, then holding it 
down. Still nothing. 

“Chuft-Captain, there is no energy 
release.” 

“The power may be gone.” 



20 



IF 




‘^uft-Captain, it may. But the 
notches in the handle may control 
intensity. The guide is now set on 
‘nil.' ” 

Chuft-Captain moved the guide 
one notch down. A moment later he 
had to resist the panicky urge to 
throw the thing as far as possible. 
The mirror-faced sphere was twist- 
ing and turning like something alive, 
changing shape like a drug night- 
mare. It changed and flowed and 
became — 

A long, slender cylinder with a 
red knob at the end and a toggle 
near the handle. The handle had 
not changed at all. 

“Chuft-Captain, there was an en- 
ergy discharge. Eek! What hap- 
pened?” 

“It turned into this. What do I do 
next?” 

Slaverstudent took the artifact and 
examined it. He would have liked to 
fire it himself, but that was the 
leader’s privilege and right. And 
risk. He said, “Try the toggle.” 

At a forward motion of the tog- 
gle the red knob lit up and leapt 
across the ice. Chuft-Captain wig- 
gled the handle experimentally. The 
red knob, still receding, bobb^ and 
weaved in response to stay in the 
line with the cylindrical barrel. When 
the knob was a red point sixty yards 
distant, Chuft-Captain stopped it 
with the toggle. 

“Variable-sword,” he muttered. 
He looked for a target. His eyes 
lit on a nearby tilted spire of dark 
rock or dirty ice. 

Chuft-Captain" gripped the arti- 
fact in both furry hands, like a big 
game fishing pole, and swung the 



red light behind the spire. The 
artifact fought his pressure, then 
gave way. The top half of the 
spire toppled, kicking up a spray 
of chipped ice. 

“A variable-sword,” he repeated. 
“But not of Slaver design. Slaver- 
student, have you ever heard of a 
weapon that changes shape?” 

“No, Chuft-Captain, neither of 
the past nor of the present.” 

“Then we’ve found something 
new.” 

“Yes!” The word was a snarl of 
satisfaction. 

“That tears it,” said Anne-Marie. 
“It’s a weapon.” 

Jason tried to nod. The pK>lice 
web held him fast. 

The other kzinti came outside and 
moved up the rise. Four kzinti stood 
spitting at each other, looking like 
four fat men, sounding like a cat- 
fight. Nessus said, “The first notch 
must have been neutral. They in- 
tend to find out what the other 
notches do.” 

“It changes shape,” said Anne- 
Marie. “That’s bad enough.” 

“Quite right,” said the puppeteer. 
“The artifact is now our prime tar- 
get.” 

Jason grinned suddenly. The pup- 
peteer reminded him of a cartoon: 

Two bearded, dirty convicts, hang- 
ing three feet off the ground by 
iron chains. One convict saying, 
“Now, here’s my plan ...” 

First we wish away the police 
web. Then — 

Again the kzin captain moved the 
guide. The gun reverted to sphere- 
and-handle, then flowed into some- 
thing hard to see at a distance. The 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



21 




toss ikzin must have realized it. He 
came down the hill, followed by 
Ihe others. One at a time the kzinti 
moved them to the top of the rise, 
so that they stood several yards 
behind the firing line, but stdl in 
the police web. 

The boss kzin resumed his firing 
stance. 

P osition number two was a para- 
bolic mirror with a silvery knob 
at the center. It did nothing at all 
to the rock Chuft-Captain was using 
for a target, though Slaverstudent 
reported an energy discharge. Chuft- 
Captain considered, then turned the 
weapon on the puppeteer. 

The puppeteer spoke in the hum- 
an tongue. “I can hear a faint high- 
pitched whine.” 

“Another control dial has form- 
ed,” Slaverstudent pointed out. 
“Four settings.” 

Chuft-Captain nodded and tried 
the second setting. It did not affect 
the puppeteer. Neither did the third 
and fourth. 

“Chuft-Captain, will you hold 
down the trigger?” Slaverstudent 
cautiously peeped over the lip of 
the parabolic mirror. “Urrrr. I was 
right. The knob is vibrating rapid- 
ly. Setting number two is a sonic 
projector — and a powerful one, 
if the puppeteer can hear it through 
near-vacuum and the thickness of 
its suit.” 

“But it didn’t knock him out or 
anything.” 

“Chuft-Captain, we must assume 
that it was designed to affect the 
Slaver nervous system.” 

“Yes.” Chuft-Captain moved the 



guide to setting number three. As 
the gun chi^ged and flowed, he 
said, “We have found nothing new. 
Sonics and variable-swords are com- 
mon.” 

“Mutable weapons are not.” 
“Mutable weapons could not win 
a war, though they might help. Urrr. 
This seems to be a projectile 
weapon. Have you the small-arms 
projectiles from the stasis box?” 
“Chuft-Captain, I do.” 

The magazine under the barrel 
swung out for loading. It took both 
kinds of projectiles. Chuft-Captain 
again sighted on the rock, using the 
newly formed telescopic sight. 

His first shot put a nick exactly 
^here he aimed it. 

His second, with the second var- 
iety projectile, blew the rock to 
flying shards. Everybody ducked but 
Chuft-Captain. 

“Should I empty the magazine 
before moving the guide?” 

“Chuft-Captain, I do not think it 
matters. The bullets should certain- 
ly be removed, but the tnuctipun 
must have known that occasionally 
they would not be. Will you indulge 
my curiosity?” 

“Since your curiosity is a trained 
one, I will,” Chuft-Captain moved 
the guide. The projectiles still in 
the gun popped out through the 
shifting surface. The artifact be- 
came a sphere-with-handle, and then 
... a sphere-with^handle. The new 
sphere was smaller than the neutral 
setting. It had a rosy hue and a 
smooth, oily texture unmarred by 
gunsights or secondary controls. 

The trigger button did nothing 
at all.

IF 




“I tire rapidly of these duds.” 

“Chuft-Captain, there is energy 
release.” 

“Very well.” Chuft-Captain fired 
at the puppeteer, using his marks- 
man’s instinct in the absence of a 
gunsight. The puppeteer showed no 
ill effects. 

Neither did the female human. 

In momentary irritation Chuft- 
Captain thought of firing the dud 
at Telepath, who was standing near- 
by looking harmless and useless. But 
nothing would happen; he would 
only upset the Telepath. He moved 
the guide to the fifth setting. 

T he artifact writhed, became a 
short cylinder with an aperture 
in the nose and two wide, flat, 
metallic projections at the sides. 
Chuft-Captain’s lips drew back from 
neatly filed feline teeth. This looked 
promising. 

He drew aim on what was left 
of the target rock — a dark blot on 
the ice. 

The gun slammed back against his 
hand. Chuft-Captain was whirled half 
around, trying to keep his feet and 
fighting the sudden pressure as a 
fireman fights a fire hose. Releasing 
the trigger didn’t shut off the in- 
candescent stream of plasma gas. 
Pressing the trigger again did. Chuft- 
Captain blinked his relief and look- 
ed around to assess damages. 

He saw a twisting trail of melted 
ice like the path of an earthworm 
hooked on LSD. Telepath was 
screaming into his helmet mike. An 
ominously diminishing scream. The 
other kzinti were carrying him to- 
ward the airlock at a dead run. 



From the trail of thin, icy fog bis 
suit left on the air, the weapotfs 
firestream must have washed across 
his body, biuuing holes in nearly 
heatproof fabric. 

The human female was running 
toward her ship. 

A glance told him that the other 
prisoners were still in the police 
web. Telepath must have knocked 
the female spinning out of the 
force field while tiying to escape 
the firestream. She was plainly vis- 
ible, running across flat ice. 

Chuft-Captain shot her with the 
stunner, then trudged away to pick 
her up. 

He had her back in the web when 
Flyer and Slaverstudent returned. 

Telepath will live, but in critical 
shape. They had dumped him in 
the freeze box for treatment on 
Kzin. 

As for Position Five on the tnuc- 
tip relic — 

“It’s a rocket motor,” said Slav- 
erstudent. “As a short range weapon 
it could be useful, but primarily it is 
a one-kzin reaction pistol. One- 
tnuctip, that is. I doubt if it would 
lift one of us against respectable 
gravity. The flat projections at the 
sides may be holds for feet. The 
tnuctipun were small.” 

“Pity you didn’t think of this 
earlier.” 

“Chuft-Captain, I acknowledge 
my failure.” 

Chuft-Captain dropped it. Pri- 
vately he too acknowledged a fail- 
ure: he had not considered the 
female dangerous. Humans were 
sentient, male and female both. He 
would not forget it again. 



THE SOFT WEAPON

Position Six was a laser. It too 
was more than a weapon. A tele- 
scopic sight ran along the ^e» 
and there was a microphone gnd at 
the back. Focus it on the proper 
target, and you could talk voice-to- 
voice. 

“This will be useful,” said Slaver- 
student. “We can find the voice and 
hearing ranges for tnuctipun from 
diis microphone.” 

•Will that make it a better 
weapon?” 

‘^uft-Captain, it will not.” 

••Then ke^ your passion for use- 
less knowledge to yourself.” Chuft- 
Captain moved the guide to the sev- 
enth setting. 

V 

it'pvarling?” 

-L/ Anne-Marie didn’t move. 
The police web held her in a slump- 
ed sitting position. Her chest rose 
and fell with shallow breathing. 
Her eyes were closed, her face re- 
laxed. 

“Nice try,” Jason told her. 

“She cannot hear you,” said Nes- 
sus. 

“I know she can’t hear me.” 

“Then why — ? Never mind. 
What did that rocket setting look 
like to you?” 

“A rocket.” 

“Using what fuel source?” 

“Is it important?” 

•‘Jason, I know nothing of war- 
fare or of weapons, but my spe- 
cies has been making and using 
machines for some considerable 
time. Why did the projectile weapon 
not include its own projectiles? Why 



did it throw them away 
changed shape?” 

“Oh” Okay, it can’t throw away 
its own mass.” Jason thought about 
that. “You’re ri^t. It can’t be using 
its own fuel. Nessus, it’s a jet. There 
was an intake somewhere that no- 
body noticed. Wait a minute. You 
couldn’t use it in space.” 

“One would affix a gas cart- 
ridge at the intake.” 

“Oh. Right.” 

“One could not be sure a given 
atmosphere would burn. How is 
the gas heated?” 

“A battery in the handle? No, it 
couldn’t put out enough power, not 
without — but there has to be one. 
Nessus? The kzinti could be listen- 
mg. 

“I ihm\c it does not matter. The 
kzinti Will know all about the 
weapon soon enough. Only the cap- 
tain can profit from learning more 
before he turns the weapon over 
to his superiors.” 

“Okay. The battery must use 
total conversion of matter.” 

“Could you not build a fusion 
motor small enough to fit into the 
handle?” 

“You’re the expert. Could you? 
Would it give enough power?” 

“I do not think so. The handle 
must contain a wide variety of 
mechanisms to control the chang- 
ing of shapes.” 

They watched the kzinti test out 
the laser form. 

"You could do it direct,” said 
Jason. “Change some of the mat- 
ter in the reaction gas to energy. 
It’d give you a terrifically hot ex- 
haust. Nessus, is there any species 



24 



IF 




in known space that has total con- 
version?” 

“None that I have heard of.” 
“Did ^e tnuotipun?” 

“I would not know.” 

“Things weren’t bad enough. Can 
you see kzinti warships armed and 
powered with total conversion?” 

A gloomy silence followed. The 
kzinti were watching the weapon 
change shape. The boss kzin had 
not spoken; he may or may not 
have been listening to their dis- 
cussions. 

A nne-Marie made small protest- 
ing sounds. She opened her 
eyes and tried to sit up. She swore 
feelingly when she found that the 
web was holding her in her cramped 
position. 

“Nice try,” said Jason. 

“Thanks. What happened?” She 
answered herself, her voice brittle 
and bitter. “They shot me, of course. 
What have I missed?” 

'"T^he seventh setting was a blank, 

' A flat-ended cylinder with a small 
wire grid near the back. No gun- 
sight. It did nothing when Chuft- 
Oaptain clicked the trigger button; 
it did nothing when he held it down, 
and nothing when he clicked it 
repeatedly. It had no effect on the 
target rock, the puppeteer, the hu- 
mans. Its only effect on Slaverstu- 
dent was to make him back warily 
away, saying, “Chuft-Captain, please, 
there is an energy discharge.” 

“A singularly ineffective energy 
discharge. Take this, Slaverstudent. 
Make it work. I will wait.” 



And wait he did, stretched com- 
fortably on the permafrost, his suit 
holding the cold a safe tenth of an 
inch away. He watched Slaverstu- 
dent’s nerves fray under the fixity 
of his stare. 

CCTTThat have I missed?” 

VV “Not much. We’ve decided 
the jet that knocked you down con- 
verts matter to energy.” 

“Is that bad?” 

“Very.” Jason didn’t try to ex- 
plain. “The sixth setting was a more- 
or less conventional message laser.” 
“The seventh does not work,” said 
Nessus. “This angers die captain. 
Jason, for the first time I regret 
never having studied weapons.” 
“You’re a puppeteer. Why should 
you . .” Jason let the sentence 
trail off. There was a thought he 
wanted to trace down. About the 
weapon. Not any particular form, 
but all forms together. 

“No sentient mind should turn 
away from knowledge. Especially 
no puppeteer. We are not known for 
our refusal to look at unpleasant 
truths.” 

Jason was silent. He was looking 
at an unpleasant truth. 

Nessus had said diat it didn’t 
matter what the boss kzin overheard. 
He was wrong. This was a thing 
Jason dared not say aloud. 

Nessus said, “The Slaver expert 
wants to go inside with the weapon. 
He has permission. He is going.” 
Anne-Marie said, “Why?” 

“There is a microphone grid on 
the seventh setting. Jason, could a 
soldier use a hand computer?” 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



25 




“He — ” wasn*t a soldierilt^on 
clamped his teeth on the words. 
“Probably could,” he said 
Presently the Slaver expert re- 
turned holding the tnuctipun wea- 
pon. 

To Jason the artifact had taken 
\f on a final, fatal fascination. If he 
was right about its former owner, 
then he could stop worrying about 
its reaching the Patriarch of Kzin. 
All he had to do was keep his mouth 
shut. In minutes, he and Anne-Marie 
and Nessus and the four kzinti would 
be dead. 

S laverstudent said, “I was right. 

The artifact lanswered me in 
an unknown speech.” 

“Then it is another — ” 

Signalling device, he had been 
about to say. But it would have been 




built to signal tnuctipun. And the 
tnuctipun had been extinct for ages 
... yet the thing had answered 
back . Chuft-Oaptain felt his back 
arch with the fighting reflex. There 
were ghost legends among the kzinti. 

“Ohuft-Captain, I believe it to be 
a computer. A hand computer could 
be very useful to a warrior. It could 
compute angles for him as he fired 
explosive projectiles.” 

“Yes. Can we use it?” 

“Not unless we can teach it the 
Hero’s Tongue. It may be too simple 
to learn.” 

“Then we pass to setting number 
Eight.” Chuft-Captain moved the 
guide down to the bottom setting. 

Again there was no gunsight. Most 
of the genuine weapons had had 
gunsights or telescopic sights. Chuft- 
Captain scowled, but raised the 




weapon and aimed once again at the 
distant, shattered rock. 

J ason cringed inside his imprisoned 
skin. Again the weapon was 
writhing, this time to the final setting. 

There were so many things he 
wanted to say. But he didn’t dare. 
The boss kzin must not know what 
was about to happen. 

The gun had twisted itself into 
something very strange. “That looks 
familiar,” said Nessus. “I have seen 
something like that, some time.” 
“Then you’re unique,” said Anne* 
Marie. 

“I remember. It was one of a 
series of diagrams on how to turn 
a sphere inside out in differential 
topology. Certainly there could be 
no connection . .” 

The boss kzin assumed markB- 
man stance. Jason braced for the 
end. 

What happened next was not at 
all what he expected. 

Unconsciously he’d been leaning 
on the police net’s force field. Sud- 
denly he was falling, overbalanced. 
He straightened, not quite sure what 
had happened. Then he got it. The 
police net was gone. He slapped 
Anne-Marie hard on the back, point- 
ed at the Court Jester, saw her nod. 
Without waiting to see her start run- 
ning, he turned and charged at the 
boss kzin. 

Something brushed by ium at high 
speed. Nessus. Not running away, 
but also charging into battle. / was 
right, thougjit Jason. He*s gone 
manic. 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



27 




VI 



^huft-Oaptain pushed the trigger 
button. Nothing happened. 

It was really too much. He stood 
a moment, marshalling words for 
Slaverstudent. A brand new kind of 
weapon, and it wouldn’t do any- 
thing! Half the settings were duds! 

He knew it as he turned: some- 
thing was wrong. The danger in- 
stinct sang in his nerves. He got no 
other warning. He had not seen the 
ship lights go out. He heard no sign 
of pounding clawed feet. The sounds 
of breathing had become a trifle 
heavy . 

He started to turn, and something 
hit him in the side. 

It felt like an armored knight 
had run him through with a blunt 
lance. It hurt. Chuft-Captain lost all 
his aplomb and all his air, bent 
sideways as far as he could manage, 
and toppled. 

He saw the world turned side- 
ways, glowing through a blue fog. 
He saw the human female struggling 
furtively in Slaverstudent s hands; 
he saw Flyer aiming a stunner across 
the ice. He saw two running figures, 
human and puppeteer, trying t^ 
reach the other ship. Flyer’s stunner 
didn’t seem to affect them. The hu- 
man had the tnuctip artifact 

He could breath again, in sharp 
shallow gasps. That blow in the side 
must have broken ribs: it could 
hardly have failed to, since kzinti 
ribs run all the way down. That 
had felt like a puppeteer’s kick! But 
that was ridiculous. Impossible. A 
puppeteer kick a kzm? 



The puppeteer reached the ship 
far in advance of the slower human. 
It paused a moment, then turned 
and ran on across the white undulat- 
ing plain. The human also paused 
at the ship’s entrance, then followed 
the puppeteer. Flyer was running 
after them. 

Behind Chuft-Captain the ship- 
lights were dim, but brightening. 
Hadn’t they been dark when he fell? 
And the stunners hadn’t worked. 
And the police webs . 

So. The eighth setting was an en- 
ergy absorber. Not a new thing, but 
much smaller than anything he’d 
heard of. 

But what had hit him? 

There was a hissing in his ears, a 
sound he hadn’t noticed. Not breath- 
ing. Had somebody’s suit been punc- 
tured? But nobody had been at- 
tacked. Except — 

Chuft-Captain slapped a hand 
over his side. He yelled with the 
pain of motion, but kept his hand 
pressed tight while he reached for 
a meteor patch. He risked one look 
under his hand before applying the 
patch. There were four tiny holes 
in the fabric. They might easily 
have marked the claws of a pup- 
peteer’s space boot. 

T he boss kzin held his marks- 
man’s stance. Jason was moving 
toward him at a dead run. He bad 
to get the weapon before the kzinti 
realized what had happened. 

Nessus passed him like a live mis- 
sile. The puppeteer reached the kzin, 
turned skidding on two front legs, 
and lashed out. Jason winced in 



U 



IF 




sympathy. That kick had been sin- 
eerel It would have tom a man in 
half, crushed his lungs and ribcage 
and spine and life. 

The mad puppeteer had barely 
paused. He ran straight toward the 
Court Jester, Jason scooped up the 
fallen weapon, skidded to a halt 
and turned. 

A kzin had Anne-Marie. 

We*ll see about that! His fingers 
moved to the weapon’s adjustment 
guide. 

A second kzin held a stunner on 
him. 

The stunner would start working 
the moment the tnuctip weapon 
shifted shape. He’d lose everything. 

He could hear Anne-Marie swear- 
ing tearfully as she fought. Then her 
voice came loud and clear. “Run, 
damnit! Jay, run!” 

He could throw the weapon to 
Nessus, then charge to tdie rescue! 
They’d get him, but • . but the 
puppeteer was well out of range 
. and couldn’t be trusted anyway. 
A puppeteer who kicked something 
that could kick back was beyond 
psychiatric help. 

Anne-Marie was still kicking and 
using her elbows. Her kzin captor 
didn’t seem to notice. The boss kzin 
lay curled like a shrimp around the 
spot of agony in his side. But the 
third kzin held his pose, still bathing 
Jason in an imaginary stunner beam. 

Jason turned and ran. 

Ho saw Nessus leave the Jester’s 
entrance and go on. He guessed what 
he would find, but he had to look. 
Sure enough, the door was soldered 
shut. 



A laser would have melted the 
steel solder away from the huU- 
metal door. But the third kzin was 
finally in motion, coming alter him, 
still trying to use the stunner. 

Jason ran on. The puppeteer was 
a diminiriiing point. Jason foOowtd 
that point, moving into a cold wi^e 
lit by a fiery arch with one bri|jht 
glare spot. 

“Flyer, return to the ship at 
once.” 

“Chuft-Captain, he’s around here 
somewhere. I can find him.” 

“Or he could find you. Return 
to the ship. The rules of this game 
have changed.” 

T he kzin was gone. Jason had 
stalked him for a dme, with 
his weapon set to the energy absorb- 
ing phase and mth his thumb on 
the guide. If he had seen the kzin, 
and if the kzin hadn’t seen him . 
a variable-sword, a hair-thin wire 
sheathed in a stasis field, would 
have cut one enemy into two stran- 
gers. But it hadn’t happened, and 
he wasn’t about to follow the kzin 
back to home base. 

Now he lay huddled in the hole 
he’d dug with the rocket phase. 

“Jay!” It was Anne-Marie. “Have 
to talk quick, they’re taking off my 
helmet. I’m not hurt, but I can’t get 
away. The ship’s taking off. Bury 
the weapon somewh — ” 

Her voice faded and was gone. 
The public band was silent. 

Nessus’s voice broke that silence. 
“Jason. Turn to the private band.” 
He had to guess which band Nes- 
sus meant. He was third time lucky. 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



29 




“Can you possibly hear me?” 
“Yah. Where are you?” 

“I do not know how to describe 
my position, Jason. I ran six or sev- 
en miles east” 

“Okay. Let’s think of a way to 
find each other.” 

“Why, Jason?” 

He was puzzled over that. “You 
think you’re safer alone? I don’t. 
How long will your suit keep you 
alive?” 

“Several standard years. But help 
w»ill arrive before then.” 

“What makes you think so?” 
“When the kzin pilot entered the 
pressure curtain, I was calling my 
people for help.” 

“What? How?” 

“Despite recent changes in the for- 
tunes of my people, that is still most 
secret.” 

Telepathy? Something in his bag- 
gage, or surgically implanted under 
his skin? The puppeteers kept their 
secrets well. Nobody had ever found 
out how the puppeteers could com- 
mit painless suicide at will. And how 
Nessus had done it didn’t matter. 
“Are they coming for you all the 
way from Andromeda?” 

“Hardly, Jason.” 

“Go on.” 

“I suppose I must. My people 
are still in this region of the galaxy, 
in the sixty^light-year volume you 
call known space. Their journey be- 
gan only twelve years ago. You see, 
Jason, my people do not intend to 
return to this galaxy. Hence it does 
not matter how much objective time 
passes during their journey. They 
can reach Andromeda in a much 



shorter subjective dme using normal 
space drives. Our ships approach 
very close to lighitepe^ Further, 
they need brave only the dangers of 
normal space, which they can handle 
easily. Hyperspace is an unpredict- 
able and imcomfortable thing, es- 
pecially for those who would spend 
decades traveling in any case.” 
“Nessus, your whole species is 
crazy. How did they keep a secret 
like that? Every one thirds they’re 
halfway to Andromeda.” 

“Naturally. Who would stumble 
across the fleet in interstellar space? 
Between systems every known spe- 
cies travels in hyperspace ... ex- 
cept the Outsiders, with whom we 
have agreements. In any case, my 
people are within reach. A scout 
will arrive within sixty days. The 
scouts are fitted with hyperdrive.” 
“Then you’re safe if you stay hid- 
den.” Danin! thought Jason. He was 
all alone. It was a proud and lonely 
thing to be a costume hero. “Well, 
good luck Nessus. I’ve got to — 

“Do not sign off. What is your 
plan?” 

“I don’t have one. I’ve got to 
see the kzinti don’t get this hack, 
but I’ve also got to get Anne-Marie 
away from them.” 

“The weapon should come first.” 
“My wife comes first. What’s your 
stake in this, anyway?” 

“With the principles behind the 
tnuctip weapon the kzinti could 
command known space. My people 
will be in known space for another 
twenty-eight human years. Should 
the kzinti learn of our fleet, it would 
be an obvious target.”

IF 




“Oh.” 

“We must help each other. How 
long can you live in your suit?” 
“Til I starve to death. 141 have 
air and water indefinitely. Say thir- 
ty days, upper limit.” 

“Your people should not cut costs 
on vital equipment, Jason. My peo- 
ple cannot arrive in time to save 
you.” 

“If I gave you the weapon, could 
you stay hidden?” 

“Yes. If the ship came in sight 
I could shoot it down with the laser 
setting. I think I could. I could 
force myself .... Jason, will the 
kzinti c^l other ships?” 

“DamnI Of course they will. 
They’d find you easy. What’ll we 
do?” 

“Can we force entrance to the 
Court JesterV 

“Yah, hut they took my keys. We 
couldn’t use the drives or the radio 
or get into the lockers.” 

“The laser would let us into the 
lockers.” 

“Right.” 

“Have you weapons aboard?” 
“No. Nothing.” 

“Then die Court Jester would be 
no more than a place from which 
to surrender. I have no suggestions.” 

iC^huft-Captain, the eighth set- 
^ ting must be the way the 
artifact is recharged. It does not it- 
self seem to be a weapon.” 

“It can be used as one. As we 
have seen. Don’t bother me now, 
Slaverstudent.” Chuft-Captain strove 
la ke^ his tone mild. He knew 
that his rage was the companion of 
his pain; Slaverstudent knew too. 



Neither had referred to the fact 
that Chuft-Captain now walked 
crouched to the side. Neither would. 
The kzin captain could not even 
bandage himself, though when daey 
reached space he could use the ship’s 
medical equipment to set the bones. 

The worst damage had been done 
to Chuft-Captain’s ego. 

Had the puppeteer known what 
he was doing? His small clawed 
foot had shattered more than a cou- 
ple of ribs. One day Chuft-Captain 
might have been Chuft, the hero 
who found the weapon that beat the 
human empire to its belly. Now he 
would be — Chuft, who was kicked 
by a puppeteer. 

“Chuft-Captain, here comes Fly- 
er.” 

“Good. Flyer! Get your tail in 
here and lift us fast.” 

Flyer went past at a quick shuf- 
fling run. Slaverstudent shut Ihe air- 
lock after him, helped Chuft-Cap- 
tain strap down, €tnd was strapping 
himself in when Flyer did his trick. 
The ^ip rose out of the ice, drip- 
ping opalescent chunks and shining 
bluewhite at the stern. 

VII 

O n the smoky arch of Beta Lyrae, 
the bright pmnt had readied 
the zenith. Behind their permanent 
veil the two stars had pulled opart 
in their orWts, so that the vague 
bri^tness had shaded into an mage 
tinge on one side and a green on the 
other. 

“One thing we do have,” said Ja- 
son, “and that’s the weapon itself.” 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



31 




“True. We have a laser, a flamc- 
tiipowing rocket and a shield against 
polke stunners. But not simultan- 
eously.” 

“I think we may have overlooked 
a setting.” 

“Wishful thinking, Jason, is not 
a puppeteer trait.” 

“Neither is knowledge of wea- 
pons. Nessus, what kind of weapon 
is this? l*m talking about the whole 
bundle, not any single setting.” 

“As you say, I am not an expert 
on warfare.” 

“I don’t think it’s a soldier’s weap- 
on. I think it’s for espionage.” 

“Would that be different? I gather 
the question is important.” 

Jason stopped to gather his 
tbou^ts. He held the gun cradled in 
his hands. It was still at the eighth 
setting, the peouhar, twisted shape 
that Nessus had compared to a dia- 
gram from differential topology. 

He held history in his hands, his- 
tory a billion and a half years dead. 
Once upon a time a small, compact- 
ly built biped had aimed this weap- 
on at beings with ball-shaped hea^, 
big dngle eyes and massive Mickey 
Moose hands, great splayed feet and 
ii*dy armored skin and clusters of 
naked pink tendrils at the comers 
of wide mouths. What could he have 
been thinking the last time he stored 
away this weapon? Did he guess 
that fifteen milHon centuries later 
a mind would be trying to guess his 
nature from his abandoned posses- 
sions? 

“Nessus, would you say this gad- 
get is more expensive to produce 
than eight gadgets for similar joibs?” 



“Assuredly, and more difficult 
But it would be easier to Cariy than 
eight discrete gadgets.” 

“And easier to hide. Have you 
ever heard of Slaver records des- 
cribing a shape-changing weapon?’* 
“No. The tnuctipun would under- 
standably have kept it a secret.” 
“That’s my point. How long could 
they keep it secret if millions of 
soldiers had models?” 

“Not long. The same objections 
hold for its use in espionage. Jason, 
what kind of espionage could a 
tnuctip do? Certainly it could not 
imitate a Slaver.” 

“No, but it could 'hide out on a 
sparsely setded world, or it could 
pretend to be a tnuctip slave. It’d 
have to have some defense against 
the Slaver power.” 

“The cap in the stasis box?” 

“Or something else, something it 
was wearing when the Slavers 
caught it” 

“These are unpleasant ideas. Ja- 
son, I have remembered something. 
The Outsiders found the stasis box 
in a cold, airless world with ancient 
pressurized buildings still standing. 
If a battle had been fou^t there, 
would the buildings have been stand- 
ing?” 

“Slaver buildings?” 

“Yes.” 

“They’d have been standing if 
the Slavers won. But th^ the Sla- 
vers would have captured at least 
one of the weapons.” 

“Only if (there were many such 
weapons. I concede your poi^ The 
owner of the weapon was a lone 
spy.”

“Good. Now -r- - 

were you so sure?” 

*'Maiiily the variety of settiogs. 
The average soUier would get 
stomped on while he was trying to 
decide which weapon to use. Then 
there’s a sonic for taking live pris- 
oners. Maybe other settings make 
them feel fear or pain. The rocket 
would be silly for a soldier; he’d 
get killed flying around a battle- 
field. But a spy could use it for the 
last stage of his landing.” 

“All right. Why is it important?” 
“Because there ought to be a self- 
destruct setting somewhere.” 

“What did — ? Ah. To keep the 
secret of the miitable weapon. But 
we have used all the settings.” 

“1 thought it would be number 
eight. It wasn’t. That’s why we’re 
still alive. An espionage agent’s self- 
destruct button would be made to 
do as much damage as possible.” 
Nessus gasped. Jason hardly no- 
ticed. “They’ve hidden it somehow,” 
he said. 

T ie Traitor's Claw was big. She 
had to be. Redundantly, she 
carried both a gravity polarizer and 
a fusion reaction motor. Probably 
she could have caught anything in 
real space barring ships of her own 
class, many of which were serving 
as police and courier ships in kzinti 
space. Kzin records listed her as a 
stolen courier ship. She was a squat 
cone, designed as a compromise be- 
tween landing ability and speed in 
an atmosphere. In contrast, the flat 
Court Jester had been designed for 
landing ability alone; she would not 



have tipped ov^^on a seventy de- 

gree 

There was more than speed te the 
TraJtofs Clowns two drives. Before 
it had ever seen a gravity polarizer, 
the human empire had taught tiie 
kzinti a lesson they would never for- 
get. The more efficient a reaction 
drive, the more effective a weapon 
it makes. A gravity polarizer was 
not a reaction drive. 

Flyer used both drives at once. 
The ship went up fast. Six thousand 
miles up the Traitor's Claw went 
into orbit. 

“We can find the prisoners with 
infrared,” said Chuft-Captain. “But 
it will do us little good if they shoot 
us down. Can the laser setting pre- 
vent us from going after them?” 

“We can call for more ships,” 
Flyer suggested. “Surely the weapon 
is important enough.” 

“It is. But we will not call.” 

Flyer nodded submission. 

Knowing what Flyer knew, Chuft- 
Captain snarled inside himself with 
humiliation and the digging agony 
in his side. He had been kicked by 
a puppeteer in full view of two sub- 
ordinates. Never again could he face 
a kzin of equal rank, never until he 
had killed the puppeteer with his 
own teeth and daws. 

Could that kick have been oold- 
bloodedly tactical? Chuft-Captain 
refused to believe it. But, intended 
or not, that kick had stymied Qiuft- 
Captain. He could not call for re- 
inforcements until the puppeteer was 
dead. 

He forced his mind back to the 
weapon. The only setting that could

harm the kzind was the laser • • • 
unless the rosy si^ere unexpectedly 
began working. But diat was unlike- 
!y. He asked, “Is there a completely 
safe way to capture them? If 
not — •• 

“There is the drive,** said Slaver- 
student. 

“They have die laser,** Fly^ re- 
minded him. “A laser that size is 
subject to a certain amount of 
spreading. We should be safe two 
hundred miles up. Closer than that 
and a good marksman could bum 
through the hull.** 

“Flyer, is two hundred miles too 
high?” 

**Cbuft-Captaln, th^ are wearing 
heatproof suits, and we can hover 
only at one-seventh Kzin-gravity. 
Our flame would barely warm the 
ice.** 

“But there is the gravity polarizer 
to push us down while the fusion 
flame pushes us up. The ship was 
designed for just that tactic. Now, 
the fugitives* suits are heatproof but 
the ice is not. Suppose we hovered 
over them with a five Kzin-gravity 
flame . ’* 

J ason held a fivoinch rosy sphere 
with a pist<^ grip handle. “It has 
to be here somewhere,** he said. 

‘Try doing things you ordinarily 
wouldn’t. Moving the gauge while 
holding the trigger down. Moving 
the guide sideways. Twisting the 
sphere.” 

Silence on the private circuit. 
Then, “No luck yet.** 

“The fourth setting was the only 
one that showed no purpose at all.** 
34 



“Yah. What in — ” 

High overhead a star had come 
into being. It was blue-white, almost 
violet-white, and for Jason it stood 
precisely at the zenith. 

“The kzinti,” said Nessus. “Do 
not shoot back. They must be out 
of range of your laser setting. You 
would only help them find you.” 

“They’ve probably found me al- 
ready, with infrared scopes. What 
the Finagle do they think they’re 
doing?” 

The star remained steady. In its 
sudden light Jason went to work on 
the weapon. He ran quickly through 
the remaining settings, memorizing 
the forms that used the trigger as 
an on-off switch, probing and prod- 
ding almost at random, until he 
reached neutral and the relic was a 
silver sphere with a handle. 

The guide would not go sideways. 
It would not remain between any 
two of the notches. It would not 
twist. 

“Are you making progress?” 

“Nothing, damnit.” 

“The destnict setting would not 
be too carefully hidden. If a weapon 
were captured an agent could always 
hope the Slavers would destroy it 
by accident.” 

“Yah.” Jason was tired of look- 
ing at the neutral setting. He chang- 
ed to laser and fired up at the new 
star, using the telescopic si^t. He 
expected and got no result, but he 
held his aim until distracted by a 
sudden change in pressure around 
his suit. 

He was up to his shoulders in 
water. 



IF 




In one surge he was out of his 
hole. But the land around him was 
gone. A few swells of wet ice rose 
glistening from a shallow sea that 
reached to all the horizon. The 
kzinti ship’s downblast had melted 
everything for miles around. 

“Nessus, is there water around 
you?” 

“Only in solid form. From my 
viewpoint the kzinti ship is not over- 
head.” 

They’ve got me. As soon as they 
turn off the drive I’ll be frozen in 
my tracks.” 

“I have been thinking. Do you 
need the destruct setting? Suppose 
you change the rocket setting, turn 
the weapon nose down and fire. The 
flame will remain on, and the weap- 
on will eat its way through the 
ice.” 

“Sure, if we could think of a way 
to keep it pointed down. Odds are 
it’d turn over in the first few feet. 
Then the kzinti find it with deep- 
radar or seismics and dig it out.” 

“True.” 

The water was getting deeper. 
Jason thought about using the rocket 
to burn his way loose once the water 
froze about his ankles. It would be 
too hot. He would probably bum 
his feet off. But he might have to 
try it. 

The blue kzinti star hung bright 
and clear against the arch of dust 
and hydrogen. A bright pink glow 
showed the Lyrae stars forty-five 
degrees from sunset. 

“Jason. Why is there a neutral 
setting?” 

“Why not?” 

THE SOFT WEAPON 



“It is not for collecting energy. 
The eighth setting does that nicely. 
It is not for doing nothing. The pro- 
jectile setting does that, unless you 
put projectiles in it. Thus the neu- 
tral setting has no purpose. Perhaps 
it does something we do not know 
about.” 

“I’ll try it.” 

The bright star above him winked 
out. 

CC^huft-Captain, I cannot locate 
^ the puppeteer.” 

“Its pressure suit may be too ef- 
ficient to lose heat. We will institute 
a search later. Inform me when the 
human stops moving.” 

VIII 

N essus’s idea would be a good 
one, Jason thought, if only he 
could make it workable. Much bet- 
ter than the destmct setting. Because 
if the destruct setting existed, it 
would almost certainly kill him. 

Probably it would kill Nessus too. 
The destruct setting on an espionage 
agent’s weapon would be made to 
do as much damage as possible. And 
there had been total conversion in- 
volved in the rocket setting. Total 
conversion would make quite a 
bomb, even if it only weighed four 
pounds, and the converted mass a 
fraction of a milligram. 

The kzinti-produced swamp was 
congealing from the bottom up. His 
boots were getting heavy. Each had 
collected a growing mass of ice. He 
kept walking so that they wouldn’t 
freeze to the bottom. 



35 




He’d searched the neutral setting, 
handle and sphere, for hidden con- 
trols. Nothing showed: nothing ob- 
vious. He tried twisting various parts 
of Hhe handle. Nothing broke, 
was good, but nothing would twist 
either. 

Maybe something should break. 
Suppose he broke off the gauge? 

He wasn’t strong enough. 

He tried twisting the ball itself. 
Nothing. 

He tried it again, holding the trig- 
ger down. 

The silvery sphere twisted one 
hundred and eighty degrees, then 
clicked. Jason released the trigger, 
and it started to change. 

“I’ve found it, Nessus, I’ve found 
something** 

“A new setting? What does it 
look Mke?” 

Like a white flash, thought Jason, 
waiting for the single instant in 
which it would look like a white 
flash. It didn’t come. The protean 
material solidified . 

“Like a cone with a rounded base, 
pointing away from the handle.’’ 

‘Try it. And if you are successful, 
good-by, Jason. Knowing you was 
pleasant.” 

“The blast could include you, 
too.” 

“Is it thus you assuage my loss 
of you?” 

“You sure you don’t have a sense 
of humor? Good-by, Nessus. Here 
goes.” 

The cone did not explode. A time 
bomb? Jason was about to start 
looking for a chronometer on the 



thing when he noticed something 
that froze him instantly. 

A hazy blue line led away in the 
direction he happened to be point- 
ing the cone. Led away and upward 
at forty degrees, wavering as tremor 
in his fingers waved the cone’s ver- 
tex. 

Another weapon. 

He released the trigger. The line 
disappeared. 

The kzin ship wasn’t in sight. Not 
that he would have used it as a tar- 
get, not with Anne-Marie aboard. 

A hidden weapon. More powerful 
than the others? He had to find out. 
Like Chuft-Captain, he tried to as- 
sume a marksman’s stance. 

His feet were frozen solidly into 
the ice. He’d been careless. He 
shrugged angrily, aimed the weapon 
a little above the horizon, and fired. 

A hazy blue line formed. He 
slowly lowered the vertex until the 
line touched the horizon. 

The light warned him. He threw 
himself flat on his back and waited 
for the blast. The light died almost 
instantly . and suddenly the shiny 
horizon-to-horizon ice rippled ^d 
shot from under him. It took his 
feet along. His body snapped like a 
whip, and then the ice tore away 
from his feet. 

He was on his face, with agony in 
his ankles. 

The backlash came. The ice jerk- 
ed under him, harmlessly. 

“Jason, what happened? There 
was an explosion.” 

“Hang . on.” Jason rolled over 
and pulled his legs up to examine 



36 



IF 




them. The pain was bad. His ankles 
didn’t feel broken, but he certainly 
couldn’t walk on them. The boots 
were covered with cracked wet ice. 

“Jason. Puppeteer. Can you hear 
me?” It was the slurred, blurry 
voice of the boss kzin. 

“Don’t . say anything, Nessus. 
I’m going to answer him.” Jason 
switched his transmitter to the com- 
mon channel. “I’m here.” 

“You have discovered a new set- 
ting to the weapon.” 

“Have I?” 

“I do not intend to play pup 
games with you. As a fighter you 
are entitled to respect, which your 
herbivorous friend is not — ” 

“How are your ribs feeling?” 

“Do not speak of that again, 
please. We have something to trade, 
you and I. You have a unique weap- 
on. I have a female human who 
may be your mate.” 

“WeU put. So?” 

“Give us the weapon. Show us 
where to find the new setting. You 
and your mate may leave this world 
in your own ship, unrestricted.” 
“Your name as your word?” 

No answer. 

CC'^^ou lying get of a — ” Jason 
I searched for the word. He 
cx>uld say two words of kzinti; one 
meant hello, and one meant — 
“Do not say it. Jason, the agree- 
ment stands, except that I will smash 
your hyperdrive. You must return 
to civilization through normal space. 
With that proviso, you may have 
my name as my word.” 



“Nessus?” 

“The herbivore must protect it- 
self.” 

“Consider the alternative. Your 
mate is not entitled to the respect 
accorded a fighter. Kzinti are car- 
nivorous, and we have been without 
fresh meat for some years.” 

“Bluff me not. You’d lose your 
only hostage.” 

“We’d lose one arm of her. Then 
another. Then a lower leg.” 

Jason felt sick. They could do it. 
Painlessly, too, if they wished; and 
they probably would, to avoid los- 
ing Anne-Marie to shock. 

He gulped. “Is she all right 
now?” 

“Naturally.” 

“Prove it.” He was stalling. Nes- 
sus could hear everything; he might 
come up with something . and 
was ever there a fainter hope? 

“You may hear her,” said the 
boss kzin. There were clunking 
sounds; they must be dropping her 
helmet over her head. Then Anne- 
Marie’s voice spoke swiftly and ur- 
gently. 

“Jay darling, listen. Use the sev- 
enth setting. The seventh. C^ you 
hear me?” 

“Anne, are you all right?” 

“I’m fine,” she shouted. “Use the 
seventh — ” Her voice died abrupt- 

ly. 

“Anne!” 

Nothing. 

There was fast, muffled kzinti 
speech in his earphones. Jason look- 
ed at the weapon a moment, then 
dropped the guide to setting number 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



37 




BevcQ. Maybe she had something. 
The cone writhed, became a mirror- 
surfaced ^here. 

“Jason, you now know your mate 
is unharmed. We must ask for your 
decision immediately.” 

He ignored the blurry voice, 
watched the weapon become a flat- 
ended cylinder with a grid near the 
handle. He’d seen the kzinti using 
that . 

“Oh,” he said. 

It was the computer, of course. 
The tnuctip computer. He smiled, 
and it hurt inside 'him. His wife had 
given him the only help she had to 
give. She’d told him where to find 
the only tnuctpin expert in known 
space. 

The hell of it was, she was per- 
fectly right. But the computer 
couldn’t hear him, and he couldn’t 
hear the computer, and they didn’t 
speak a common language anyway. 

Wait a minute. This was setting 
number seven; but if you counted 
neutral as the first setting, then — 
no. Setting six was only the laser. 

Finagle! The Belter oath fitted. 
Finagle’s First Law was holding 
beautifully. 

His ankles stopped hurting. 

Decoyed! He twisted his head 
around to find his enemy. The bar- 
gain had been a decoy! Already his 
head buzzed with the stunner beam. 
He saw the kzin, hiding behind a 
half-mehed bulge of ice with only 
one eye and the stunner showing. 
He fi^ at once. 

The weapon was on computer 
setting. His hand went slack. 



44T do not understand why she 
X wanted him to use the sev- 
enth setting.” 

“The computer, was it not?” 
“Chuft-Captain, it was.” 

“He could not have used the com- 
puter.” 

“No. Why did the prisoner — ” 
“She may have meant the sixth 
setting. The laser was the only wea- 
pon a human could have used 
against us.” 

“Unr. Yes. She counted wrong, 
then.” 

The ship^to-suit circuit spoke. 
“Ohuft-Captain, I have him.” 
“Flyer, well done. Bring him in.” 
“Chuft-Oaptain, do we still need 
him?” 

The kzin was not in a mood to 
argue. “I hate to throw anything 
away. Bring him in.” 

H is head floated, his body spun, 
•his ankles hurt like fiuy. He 
shuddered and tried to open his 
eyes. The lids came up slowly, re- 
luctantly. 

He was standing in a police web, 
slack neck muscles holding bis head 
upright in one-eighth gee. No won- 
der he hadn’t known which way was 
up. 

Anne-Marie was twelve inches 
to his side. Her eyes held no hope, 
only exhaustion. 

“Damn,” he said. One word to 
cover it all. 

The kzind yowrling had been so 
much a part of the background that 
he didn’t notice it until it stopped. 
After a moment the boss kzin step- 



38 



IF 




ped in front of him, moving slow- 
ly and carefully and coiled protec- 
tively around his left side. 

“You are awake.” 

“Obviously.” 

One massive four-dawed hand 
held the tnuotip weapon, still at 
the computer setting. The kzin held 
it up. “You found a new setting on 
this. Tell me how to reach it.” 

“I can’t,” said Jason. “I found it 
by accident and lost it the same 
way.” 

“That is a shame. Do you realize 
we have nothing to lose?” 

Jason studied the violet eyes, 
fruitlessly. “What do you mean?” 
“Either you will tell me of your 
own free will, or you can be per- 
suaded to tell, or you cannot In 
any case, we have no reason not to 
remove your mate’s arm.” 

He turned and spoke in the kzin- 
ti tongue. The other aliens left the 
room. 

“We will be leaving this world in 
an hour.” The boss kzin turned and 
settled his orange bulk carefully in 
a kzinti contour couch, grunting 
softly with the pain of movement. 

He meant it. His position was too 
simple for doubt The boss kzin had 
a tnuctip weapon to take back to 
Kzin, and he had two human cap- 
tives. The humans were of no use 
to him. But he had great use for 
Jason’s knowledge. Wlhat he offered 
was a simple trade: knowledge for 
the meat on their bones. 

“I can’t talk,” said Jason. 

“All right,” Anne-Marie said dul- 
ly. 



“I can't” The cone-form was too 
powerful. Its beam set up spontane- 
ous mass conversion in anything it 
touched. And he couldn’t explain. 
The boss kzin might hear him; and 
the kzinti didn’t know just what they 
were after. 

“All right, you can’t. We’ve had 
it. How did they get you?” 

“I got stupid. While the boss kzin 
was talking to me one of the others 
snuck up and used a sonic.” 

“The seventh setting — ” 

“I didn’t have time to figure any- 
thing out. There isn’t enou^ air to 
carry soimd out there.” 

“I didn’t think of that. How's 
Nessus?” 

“Still free.” 

The boss kzin broke in. “We wUl 
have it soon. The puppeteer has no 
place to hide and nothing iwtth 
which to fight. Do you expect It to 
rescue you?” 

Anhe-Marie smiled sourly. ”Not 
really.” 

T he other kzinti returned, carry- 
ing things. There were pieces 
of indecipherable kzinti equipment, 
and there was a medkit from the 
emergency ’doc in the Court Jester. 
They set it all down next to the 
police web and went to work. 

One piece of kzinti equipment 
was a small tank with a pump and 
a piece of soft plastic tubing at- 
tached. Jason watched them wrap 
the tubing three or four times 
around Anne-Marie’s upper arm. 
They joined the other end to the 
pump and started it going. 



THE SOFT WEAPON

“It’s cold,” she said. “Freezing.” 

“I can’t stop them,” said Jason. 

She shivered. “You’re sure?” 

He gave up. He opened his mouth 
to shout out his surrender. The boss 
kzin raised his furry head question- 
ingly — and Jason’s voice stopped 
in his throat. 

He’d used the hidden setting just 
once. For only an instant had the 
violet beam touched the horizon, 
but the explosion had damn near 
killed him. Obviously the hidden 
setting was not meant to be used on 
the surface of a planet. 

It could be used only from space. 
Was it meant to destroy whole 
worlds? 

But Anne-Marie hurt! 

She said, “All light, you’re sure. 
Jay, dem’t look like that. Jay? I can 
grow a new arm. Relax! Stop wor- 
rying about it!” The anguish in Ja- 
son’s face was like nothing she’d 
ever seen. 

The burry voice said, “She will 
never reach an autodoc.” 

“Shut upr Jason screamed. 

Soft kzinti noises ^^tered the si- 
lence. One of the kzinti left: the 
pilot, the one with the white streak. 
The others talked. Ihey talked of 
cooking, kzinti sex, human sex, Beta 
Lyirae, how to hunt puppeteers, or 
him to turn a s{^re inside out with- 
out forming a cusp. Jason couldn’t 
tell. They used no gestures. 

Anne-Marie said, “They could 
have planted a mike on us.” 

“Yah.” 

“So you can’t tell me what you’re 
hiding.” 



“No. I wish I spoke Wunderland- 
er.” 

“/ don’t speak Wunderlander. 
Dead language. Jay, I can’t feel my 
arm any more. Ihere must be li- 
quid nitrogen in this tube.” 

“I’m sorry. I can*t help,*' 

^4Tt is not working,” said Chuft- 
JL Captain. 

“It should work,” said Slaverstu- 
dent. “We may not get results with 
the first limb. We probably will with 
the second. The second time, they 
will know that we mean what we 
threaten.” He looked thoughtfully 
at the prisoners. “Also, I think we 
should eat our meals in here.” 
“They know that limbs can be re- 
grown.” 

“Only by human-huilt machines. 
There are none here.” 

“You have a point.” 

“It will be good to taste fresh 
meat again.” 

Flyer returned. “Oiuft-Captain, 
the kitchen is programmed.” 

“Good.” Chuft-Captain incau- 
tiously shifted his bulk, tensed all 
over at the pain. It would have been 
nice if he could have put pressure 
bandages around his ribs. The ribs 
had been set and joined wkh pins. 
But he could not use pressure ban- 
dages; they would remind his crew 
of what had happened. He would 
be shamed. 

Kicked by a puppeteer. 

“I have been thinking,” he said. 
“Regardless of what the human 
tels us, we must take the tnuctip 
relic to Kzin as quickly as possible.

IF 




There I will drop you, Slaverstudent, 
along with the weapon and the 
freeze box containing Telepath. Fly- 
er, you and I will return here for 
the herbivore. He cannot be rescued 
in that time. He will be easy to find. 
A sight search will find him unless 
he digs a hole, in which case we 
may use seismographs.” 

“He will have a month to antici- 
pate.” 

“Yes. He will.” 

“Can you understand me?” 

Three pairs of kzinti eyes jerked 
around. The voice belonged to none 
of them. It sounded foreign, arti- 
ficial. 

“Repeating. Can you understand 
me?” 

It was the gun speaking. The tnu- 
ctip weapon. 

IX 

CiTt’s learned their language,” 
X said Jason. And all the hope 
drained out of him. 

“It’ll tell them where to find that 
setting you were trying to hide.” 
“Yah.” 

“Then tell me this. Jay.” She was 
on the edge of hysteria. “What good 
will it do me to lose my arm?” 
Jason filled his lungs and shouted. 
“Hey!” 

Not one kzin moved. They hov- 
ered around the weapon, all talking 
at once. 

“Hey, Captain! What sthondat 
was your sister?” 

They all jerked around. He must 
have pronounced the word right. 



“You must not use that word 
again,” said the boss kzin. 

“Get this thing off my wife’s 
arm!” 

The boss kzin thought it over, 
spoke to the pilot. The pilot manipu- 
lated the poHce web to free Anne- 
Marie’s arm, used a cloth to protect 
his hand while he removed the cold, 
deadly tube. He turned off the 
pump, readjusted the police web 
and went back to the discussion. By 
then the discussion hiad become a 
dialogue; the boss kzin had shut 
the others up. 

“How’s your arm?” 

“Feels dead. Maybe it is. What 
were we hiding. Jay?” 

He told her. 

“Ye gods. And now they’ve got 
it.” 

“Could you use an anesthetic?” 
“It doesn’t hurt yet.” 

“Let me know. Th^re all 
through torturing us. They may eat 
us, but it’ll be all at once.” 

T he computer was doing most of 
the talking. 

A kzin was holding up the tnuctip 
cap, the one they’d found in the stas- 
is box. The computer spoke. 

He held up the small metal object 
that might have been a communi- 
cator. The computer spoke again. 
The boss kzin spoke. 

The computer spoke at length. 
The boss kzin picked up the weap- 
on and did things to it. Jason 
couldn’t see what The kzin was 
facing away from him. But the weap- 
on writhed. Jason snarled in his

throat. He commonly used curses 
for emphasis. He knew no words 
to cover this situation. 

The boss kzin spoke briefly and j* 
left» cradling the weapon. One of 
the others followed: the expert on 
Slavers. Jason caught one gjiimpse 
of the weapon as the boss kzin went 
through the door. 

The kzin with the white stripe, the 
pilot, remained. 

Jason felt himself starting to 
shake. The weapon, the soft, mut- 
able weapon. When the boss kzin 
had left the room, he’d carried a 
gun handle attached to a double 
cone with rounded bases and points 
which barely touched. 

He didn’t understand. 

Then his eyes, restlessly searching | 
the room as if for an answer, fell 
on the empty stasis box. There was 
a tnuctip cap, and a small metal ob- 
ject which registered in hyperspace, 
and a preserved Slaver 'hand . 

It began to make sense. 

Did the computer have eyesight? 
Obviously. The kzinti had been 
showing it objects from the stasis 
box. 

Take a computer smart enough 
to learn a language by hearing it 
spoken for an hour. Never mind its 
size; any sentient being will build 
a computer as small as possible, if 
only to reduce the time lag in 
thinking with impulses moving at 
lightspeed or less. Let the computer 
know only what its tnuctipun build- 
ers tau^t it, plus what it had seen 
and heard in this room. 

It had seen a tnuctipun survival 



42 




kit. It had seen mSnbers of a spec- 
ies it did not recognize. The unfami- 
liar bedngs had asked questions 
which made it obvious that they 
knew little about tnuctipun, and that 
they could not ask questions of a 
inuctip. They didn’t speak the tnuc- 
tipun language. They were desper- 
ately anxious for details about a 
tnuctpun top secret weapon. 

Obviously they were not allies 
of the tnuctipim. 

They must be enemies. In the 
Slaver War there had been, could 
be, no neutrals. 

He said, “Anne.” 

“StiU here.” 

“Don’t ask questions, just follow 
orders. Our lives depend on it. See 
that kzin?” 

“Right. You sneak up on him 
from behind; and I’ll hit him too.” 

THE SOFT WEAPON 



from behind. I’ll hit him with my 
purse.” 

“This is not funny. When I give 
the word, we’re both going to spit 
at his ear.” 

“You’re right. That’s not funny.” 

“I’m in dead earnest. And don’t 
forget to compensate for low grav- 
ity.” . 

“How are you going to give the 
word with a mouthful of saliva?” 

“Just spit when I do. Okay?” 

Jason’s shot brushed the kzin’s 
furry scalp. Anne-Maiie’s caught 
him square in the ear. The kzin 
came to his feet with a howl. Then, 
as both humans cleared their throats 
again, the kzin moved like Mghtning. 
The air stiffened suddenly about 
their heads. 

The kzin contemptuously return- 
ed to his crouch against a wall. 




It became very hard to breathe. 

Blinking was a slow, excruciating 
process. Talking was out of the 
question. Warm air, laden with CX)2, 
did not want to dissipate. It stayed 
before their faces, waiting to be in- 
haled again and again. The kzin 
watched them struggle. 

Jason forced his eyes closed. 
Blinking had become too painful. 
He tried to remember that he’d 
planned this; that it had worked per- 
fectly. Their heads and bodies were 
now entirely enclosed by the police 
web. 

Now here*s my plan, 

puppeteer ran east,” said 
A Chuft-Captain. And he turn- 
ed west. He didn’t want to kill the 
puppeteer without knowing it. 

The weapon was hard and awk- 
ward in his hand. He was a little 
afraid of it, and a little ashamed of 
being afraid: a hangover from that 
awful moment when the weapon 
spoke. There were ghost legends 
among the kzinti. Some of the most 
fearsome spoke of captured weap- 
ons haunted by their dead owners. 

Nobles weren’t supposed to be 
superstitious, not out loud. 

A computer that could learn new 
languages was logical. The only way 
to reach the setting for the matter 
conversion beam had been to ask 
the computer setting; and that was 
logical too. A matter conversion 
beam was a dangerous secret. 

Briefly, Qmft-Captain wondered 
about that. It seemed that for an 
honoraMe kzin every recent change 



was a change for the worse. The 
conquest of ipm biul ended when 
kzinti met honian. Then had come 
the puppeteers with their trade out- 
posts; any kzin who attacked a pup- 
peteer invariably found himself, not 
harmed physically, but mined finan- 
cially. No kzin could fight power 
like that. Would the tnuctip weapon 
reverse these changes? 

There had been a time, between 
the discoveries of atomic power and 
the gravity polarizer, when it seem- 
ed the kzinti species would destroy 
itself in wars. Now the kzinti held 
many worlds, and the danger was 
past. But was it? A matter conver- 
sion beam. 

There is no turning away from 
knowledge. 

Haunted weapons. 

He stopped on a rise of perma- 
frost some distance from the ship. 
By now half the sky was blood red. 
An arm of the hydrogen spiral was 
sweeping across the world, prepar- 
ing to engulf it. Hours or days from 
now the arm would pass, moving 
outward on the wings of photon 
pressure, leaving the world with a 
faintly thicker atmosphere. 

But we'll be long gone by then, 
Chuft-Captain thought. Already ho 
was looking ahead to the problem 
of reaching Kzin. If human ships 
caught the Traitor's Claw entering 
Kzin’s atmosphere, the kzinti would 
clearly be violating treaty mles. But 
they weren’t likely to be caught, 
not if Flyer did everything right. 

“Chuft-Oaptain, this setting has 
no gunsight.” 



IF 




“No? You’re right, it doesn’t.” 
He considered. “Perhaps it was 
meant only for large targets. A 
world seen from close up. The ex- 
plosion was fierce.” 

“Or its accuracy may be low. Or 
its range. I wonder. Logically the 
tnuctpun should have included at 
least a pair of notches for sighting.” 
Something's wrong. The danger 
instinct whispered in his ear. Super- 
stition, he snarled, and he raised the 
weapon stiffly, aiming well above 
the horizon. “Let us find the an- 
swer,” he said. 

I n this area of Cue Ball the ice 
had melted and refrozen. It was 
as flat as a calm lake. 

Nessus had stopped at the edge. 
He’d faced around, stopped again, 
held the pose for several minutes, 
then faced back and started across 
the flat, red^inged ice. Muscles rip- 
pled beneath his pressure suit 
It wasn’t as if he exp^ed to 
help his human employees. They 
had gotten themselves into this. And 
be had neither weapons nor allies 
nor even stealth to aid him. A hu- 
man infantryman could have crawl- 
ed on his belly, but Nessus’ legs 
weren’t built that way. On a white 
plain with no cover he had to trot 
upright, bouncing gaily in the low 
gravity. 

His only weapon was his hind 
leg. 

Thinking that, he remembered 
the jarring impact as he planted 
his foot in the kzin’s side. Two hun- 
dred and forty pounds of charging 



puppeteer applied over five square 
inches of clawed ^ace boot. The 
shock wave had jarred up threiigh 
thigh and hip and qnne, jerked at 
his skull and continued ^ong the 
necks to snap his teeth dxut with a 
sharp double Click. Like kiddng a 
mountain, a soft but solid moualain. 

The next instant he was ruiUMiig, 
really terrified for the first itime in 
his life. But behind him |he kzin 
had vented a long whistling scream 
and folded tightly around hims^ . 

Nessus went on. He’d trelted 
across the frozen lake without see- 
ing kzinti or kzinti ship. Now the 
ice was beginning to swell and dtp. 
He’d reached the periphery of the 
blast area. Now there was a touch 
of yellow light ahead. Small and 
faint, but unmistakably yeBow 
against the pink ice. 

Ship lights. 

He went on. He’d never know 
why. He’d never admit it to himself. 

Thock! Hind boot slamming sol- 
idly into hard meat. Whistling shriek 
of agony between sharp-filed carni- 
vore teeth. 

He wanted to do it again. Nessus 
had the blood lust. 

He went up a rise, moving slowly, 
though his feet wanted to dance. He 
was weaponless, but his suit was a 
kind of defense. No projectile short 
of a fast meteorite could harm him. 
Like silicone plastic, the pressure 
suit was soft and malleable under 
gentle pressures — such as walking 
— but it instantly became rigid all 
over when something struck it. 

He topped the rise. 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



45 




T ihe ship lights might have come 
from the Court Jester, They 
didn’t. Nessus saw the airlock open- 
ing, and he charged down the slope 
so the next rise hid him from view. 

The kzinti ship was down. Tliey 
must have landed with the gravity 
polarizer; otherwise he would have 
seen them. If they had then captur- 
ed Jason on foot, he might still be 
dHve. He might not. The same went 
for Anne-Marie. 

Now what? The kzinti ship was 
beyond this next rise of ice. At least 
one kzin was outside. Were they 
looking for him? No, they’d hardly 
expect him here! 

He had reached the trough be- 
tween the two swells. They were 
long and shallow and smooth, like 
waves near an ocean shoreline. 

The top of the swell behind Nes- 
sus suddenly sparkled with harsh 
bluewhite sunlight 
Nessus knew just what to do, and 
he did it instantly. No point in cov- 
ering his cranial bulge with his 
necks; he’d only get his larynxes 
crushed. Ihe padding would protect 
his brain, or it wouldn’t. He folded 
his legs under him and tucked his 
heads tight between his forelegs. He 
didn’t have to think about it. The 
puppeteer’s explosion reflex was no 
less a reflex for being learned in 
childhood. 

He saw the light; he curled into 
a ball, and the ground swell came. 
It batted him like a beach bs^. His 
rigid, form-fitting shell retained his 
shape. It could not prevent the 
ground swell from slamming him 



away, nor his brain from jarring un- 
der its thick skull and its extra pad- 
ding. 

X 

H e woke on his back with his legs 
in the air. There was a tingly 
ache along his right side and on the 
right sides of his necks and legs. 
Half his body surface would be one 
bruise tomorrow. The ground still 
heaved; he must have been uncon- 
scious for only a moment. 

He clambered shakily to his feet. 
The claws were an enormous help 
on the ice. He shook himself once, 
then started up the rise. 

Suddenly and silently the kzinti 
ship topped the rise. A quarter of a 
mile down the swell it slid grace- 
fully into space in a spray of ice. 
It was rotating on its axis, and Nes- 
sus could see that one side was red 
hot. It skimmed through the near- 
vacuum above the trough, seeming 
to drift rather than fall. It hit solid- 
ly on the shallow far rise and plow- 
ed to a stop. 

Still upright. Steam began to sur- 
round it as it sank into melting ice. 

Nessus approached without fear. 
Surely any kzin inside was dead, 
and any human too. But could he 
get in? 

The outer airlock door was miss- 
ing, ripped from its hinges. The in- 
ner door must have been bent, for 
it leaked a thin fog from the edges. 
Nessus pushed the Cycle button and 
waited. 

The door didn’t move. 



46 



IF 




Nessus cast an eye aroand the 
airlock. There mast be teUit^es to 
sense whether the ooiter door was 
closed and whether there was pres- 
sure in the lock. 

There was one, a sensitized sur- 
face in the maimed outer doorway. 
Nessus pushed it down with his 
mouth. 

Air sprayed into the enclosure, 
turned to fog and blew away. Nes- 
sus’ other head was casting about 
for a pressure sensor. He found it 
next to the air outlet. He swung 
alongside it and leaned against it 
so that his suit trapped the air. He 
leaned into the pressure. 

The inner door swung open. Nes- 
sus fought to maintain his position 
against the roaring wind. When the 
door was fully open he dodged in- 
side. The door slanuned just behind 
him. 

Now. What had happened here? 

The kzinti lifesystem was a howl- 
ing hurricane of air replacing what 
he’d let out. Nessus poked into the 
kitchen, the control section and two 
privacy booths without seeing any- 
thing. He moved down the hall and 
looked into what he remembered 
would be the interrogation room. 
Perhaps here . 

He' froze. 

Anne-Marie and Jason were in 
the police web. Obviously; because 
both were standing and both were 
unconscious. They appeared undam- 
aged. But the kzini 

Nessus felt the world swim. His 
heads felt lighter than air. He’d been 
through a lot ... He turned his 



eyes away. It occurred to him that 
the humans must be unconscious 
from the lack of oxygen. The police 
web must surround them completely, 
even to their heads. Otherwise the 
shock would have tom their heads 
off. Nessus forced himself to imove 
to the police web. He kept his eyes 
resolutely away from the kzm. 

Their were the controls, ^as that 
the power switch? He tried it The 
humans drifted gracefully to the 
floor. Done. 

And Nessus found his eyes creep- 
ing back to the kzin. 

He couldn’t look away. 

The carnivore had struck like a 
wet snowball thrown with awful 
force. He was a foot up the wall, 
and he was all spread out on a bor- 
der of splashed circulatory fluid, 
and he stuck . 

Nessus fainted. He woke up, still 
standing because of the normal k>ne 
of his relaxed muscles, to find Anne- 
Marie shaking him gently and trying 
to talk to him. 

^4T’m worried about him,” said 

X Anne-Marie. 

Jason turned away from the Jes- 
ter’s control panel. “He can get 
treatment on Jinx. There are pup- 
peteers in Sirius Mater.” 

“That’s still a week away. Isn’t 
there anything we can do for him? 
He spends all his time in his r»em. 
It must be awful to be manic- 
depressive.” She was rubbing the 
stump where the emergency doc had 
amputated her arm — a gesture 
Jason hated. It roused guilt feelings. 



THE SOFT WEAPON 



47 




But she’d get a new arm on Jinx. 

“I hate to teU you,” he said, “but 
Nessus isn’t in a depressive stage. 
He stays in his room because he’s 
avcMding us.” 

“Us?” 

“Yah. I think so.” 

“But Jay! Vsr 

“Don’t take it personal, Anne. 
We’re a symbol.” He lowered his 
head to formulate words. “Look at 
it this way. You remember when 
Nessus kicked the kzin?” 

“Sure. It was beautiful.” 

“And you probably know he was 
nerving himself to fire oh the kzinti 
ship if I gave him the tnuctipun 
weapK>n. Finally, you know that he 
came voluntarily to the kzinti ship. 
I think he was going to fight them 
if he got the chance. He knew they’d 
captured me, and he knew they had 
the weapon. He was ready to fight.” 
“Good for him. But Jay — ” 
“Damnit, honey, it wasrCt good 
for him. For him, it was purest evil. 
Cowardice is moral for puppeteers. 
He was violating everything he’d 
ever learned!” 

“You mean he’s ashamed of him- 
self?” 

“That’s part of it. But there’s 
more. It was the way we acted when 
we wc^e up. 

“You remember how it was? Nes- 
sus was standing and looking at 



what was left of the kzin pilot You 
had to shake him a few times be- 
fore he noticed. Then what did he 
find out? I, Jason Papandreou, who 
had been his friend, had planned 
the whole thing. I had known that 
the boss kzin and the Slaver expert 
were walking to their deaths, be- 
cause the computer form of the 
weapon had given them the self- 
destruct setting and told them it 
was the matter conversion beam. I 
knew that, ;and I let them walk out 
and blow themselves to smithereens. 
I tricked the pilot into putting our 
heads in the police web, but I left 
him outside to die. And I was proud 
of it! And you were proud of me! 
“Now do you get it?” 

“No. And I’m still proud of you.” 
“Nessus isn’t. Nessus knows that 
we, whom he probably thought of 
as funny-looking puppeteers — you 
may remember we were thinking of 
him as almost human — he knows 
we committed a horrible crime. 
Worse, it was a crime he was think- 
ing of committing himself. So he’s 
transferred his shame to us. He’s 
ashamed of us, and he doesn’t want 
to see us.” 

“How far to Jinx?” 

“A week.” 

“No way to hurry? 

“I never heard of one.” 

“Poor Nessus!” END

GODS 
OF THE 

DARK by BRUCE McALLISTER 

AND LIGHT 

Landing on the strange planet, they 
prayed at once to their gods. But 
to what gods did the natives pray? 



G regory Shawn strained his neck 
upward at the two glaring apri- 
cots that were the suns of V-Planet- 
14. The sands beneath him had 
warmed his legs until they glistened 
with streams of sweat, and the weak 
wind only managed to pack more 
hot air up under his heavy robe. 

Pulling at the cloth lying against 
his chest, he let a trickle of air 
pass between Ids skin and the robe. 
Further arm movement was im- 
possible, as the other colonists 
pressed in tightly against him, form- 
ing an oval of sun-and-sand rough- 
ened flesh in the middle of the 
gorge. 

His wife moved at his side, but 
remained silent. 

From where he stood he could 



see only a small curve of the star- 
ship’s port side. Like the ragged 
boulders and cliffs, the starship 
hull wavered liquidly in the heat. 

Soon even the people beside him 
began to waver, but the illusion 
passed when the group began to 
sing: 

for the pain of our new world. 

For tho pain of our new skies. 

For the evil which from our Day 
Over and around vs lies, 

Meah-Trin, to Thee we raise 
This our hymn of painful days. 

In the terror of each hour. 

Of the day and of the night. 

Reck and swamp, and free and flower. 
Suns and moons and stars of fright, 
Meah-Trin, to Thee we pray: 

Save vs from these painful days

The path back to die tents was 
sand, then rock and sand, then rock, 
then rock and clay, as the tents 
and pungent swamp barbed with 
thin cattails came into sight. His 
wife clendhed a fold of his robe 
in her hand, and they cleared the 
final grade before the colony tents. 

The rocky hills behind the tents 
were smeared with the orange-red 
of iron deposits; the swamp water 
reflected the saffron sky; the ground 
was a dusty yellow-orange. The only 
cool colors dotting his vision were 
the triangular darknesses of the tent 
entrances. 

Gregory led his wife to the second 
line of tents, entered his own tent, 
and seated himself before a rough 
rock slab. Shuffling through the 
black script which covered a dozen 
neat opaque gray cellophane sheets, 
he found the unused sheets and 
began writing with a small pen: 

“Dear Meah-Trin, Beloved Twin- 
Gods-as-One, Gods of the Earth, 
of Man’s New Worlds, of the Un- 
charted Universe: Today — one 
week after the Day of Our Arrival 
— we sang the new hymn as we 
stood on the sands of the Gorge of 
Our Arrival. It is not a thankful 
hymn. There is little to be thankful 
for in our colony on this rock-and- 
swamp planet of sister suns. 

“Until today we could not sing 
the new hymn. No one would sing 
it, because Jonathan would not sing 
it. Jonathan would not sing it, be- 
cause his wife, ebony-haired Ruth- 
ana, would not sing it. Ruthana 
said diat since yellow-skinned Darby 
changed the old hymn to the new 
three days ago, the new hymn was 



a distortion of the traditional hymn 
we brought with us, and should not 
be sung. 

“•But two nights ago a heavy- 
scaled leech from the swamp cat- 
tails crawled into Jonathan’s tent 
and ate into Ruthana’s throat and 
crawled into her belly. Jonathan 
was willing to sing the hymn to- 
day, so everyone sang the hymn to- 
day. 

“Our hearts ache because we 
think and dream ominous visions 
of our children and our children’s 
children having to grow to adult- 
hood in a world of constant pain. We 
cannot understand You in this new 
world of pain, and we search for 
Your guiding hand in aid.” 

T he iron tinge of the rocks was 
pale now in the moonlight, 
and invisible in places under the 
inky shadows cast by crags and 
crevasses. 

The darkness of the cave opemng 
would normally have been appeal- 
ing, but tonight hunger and fatigue 
added to apprehension made the 
animal reluctant to enter his lair. 

Four familiar pairs of eyes moved, 
glinted, and moved again inside the 
cave. 

The animal’s hooves clacked and 
echoed, as it pawed hesitatingly on 
the rock before the cave. With head 
upturned toward the star-spangled 
tar of the night sky and monkeyish 
forehead shining under the moon’s 
light, the animal snapped its needle- 
point teeth in a shrill chatter and 
gestured with humanoid hands at 
the night: 

“O Gods of Stink-water and hard-

times there, but there is none there. 
My mate and I have three small-

me for not bringing her four weights

‘T have only four legs and two

and they are tired arms and legs.” 

Meah-Trin, Gods of AH: 

JL/ We lift our voices in song 
twice a week now. It is good to 
join in prayer and hymns, but it is 
difficult each time to witness an- 
other of us missing or pained by the 
new world. 

‘‘Dark^bearded SaHamiah was 
missing at the last hymnal meet- 
ing. His wife, golden-^haired Lena, 
tells us that five days ago he was 
searching for wood to burn and 
he fell on a rock near the swamp 
and cut and broke a lower bone of 
his right leg. She says that yester- 
day she cleaned his leg, which was 
running with pus, and that in the 



pus were maggots. She says that 
last nigjht a finger-sized maggot 
crawled from the wound in Sal- 
lamiah’s leg, and soft pieces of bone 
ran out with the purulence. She 
says that SaHamiah passed away in 
the night, and a hundred maggots 
crawled on his chest when she went 
to weep on him. 

“Pale Robert and curlynhaLr Cyn- 
thia passed away two weeks ago. 
Their faces were bloated, but there 
were no maggots. Four others with 
whom I was not weH acquainted 
were missing from the hymnal meet- 
ing last week. Two were given fiery 
funerals because of the maggots 
in their bodies. 

“Four days ago slant-eyed Daniel 
struck his head on a wood piling 
sunk for the swamp pier, and his 
skull went soft in three days, and 
the top of his mouth sagged in and 
choked him. His wife passed away 
from the maggots two weeks ago. 

“At the last hymnal meeting long- 
haired Peter was in great pain. His 
right cheek was peeling from the 
bone in hard pieces, like sun-baked 
mud. A week ago Peter volunteered 
to eat some of the food-stuffs of 
the swamp. He offered a small 
green fruit to Elizabeth and me, 
but we refrained from tasting it. I 
am thankful that we did, since the 
swamp plant might be the cause 
of Peter’s disease or poisoning. The 
corn, potatoes and beans we brought 
with us grow well enough in the 
ground of the new planet, and they 
suffice as our diet. 

“We stiH must pray for under-

44T^oar Meah-Trin, Gods of AU: 

U Very few of us wish to lift 
our voices in the old thankful hymns 
we brought with us, so Darby chang- 
ed four more of the old hymns to 
new hymns. But Darby, too, was 
missing at the last hymnal meet- 
ing. 

“Pepper-haired Samson, Darby’s 
son, could not bury Darby because 
his bones and flesh were on orangish 
mud. We had to hum his body in 
his tent. Samson went to live with 
slender Patricia, whose husband did 
not return from the swamp five 
days ago. 

“Although Samson and Patricia 
have not wed, it was decided that 



there was mb sin in their living un- 
der the same tent, (because they 
know Your Rules Vitae and are 
good people.

one who will change more hymns 
for us in these times of pain. His 
wife, red-haired Barbara, passed 
away at the talons of the Devil 
last night. Her thigh was found 
near their tent. Thomas could find 
no other remains of her body, ex- 
cept for her life-<blood spread out 
in the tent and among the rocks. 

“I spoke to Thomas last night, 
and he blasphemed, and I was 
ashamed in his presence. Although 
he can find no imderstanding of 
Your ways, he will be the one who 
v/ill change more hymns fbr us, 
since he knows well the words of 
our hearts and can put them to the 
old music. 

“Dear Meah-Trin, I’m afraid 
for Elizabeth, my wife. I have not 
been hint in this new world except 
through the pains and injuries of 
my friends. Four of them have been 
so pained by this new world that 
they blaspheme in front of us all. 
I will never blaspheme against you, 
even if Elizabeth is hurt, hut I’m 
afraid that my mind and heart 
would not be •&e same after it — 
because, though I have the power 
to witness the sorrows of others, I 
might not have the power to bear 
my sorrow’s at Elizabeth’s pain. 

“I cannot — we all cannot — 
find understanding of Your ways.” 

44/^ Gods of the stink-water and 
hard-ground and moons and 
suns — we are thankful for the meat 



52 



IF 




you have sent us, but my arm 
aches where the two-legged meat at- 
tacked me. I can not bring meat to 
my mate and small-young if I do not 
have my arms to carry the meat 
with.” 

4 4T^ear Meah-Trin, Gods of All: 

-L/ Tonight must be our Night 
of judgment, we fear. Seven more 
of us have passed away the last few 
days. Three tents bum, and mag- 
gots and muddy flesh and leeches 
burn in them. 

“Azure-eyed Sophia lost her hand 
to the talons of the Devil early to- 
night. The Devil was occupying a 
form as dark as Hell. Its shape was 
that of a dog — four legs and a 
torso — and that of an ape — 
stomadi, chest, arms and head. It 
was shorter in stature than a man, 
but probably of the same wei^t; 
its skin shovm in the moonlight like 
a moist bat-skin, and its arms and 
legs were thin and sinewy, and its 
feet sounded as it esca|^ as if 
they were hooved. 

“The Devil came to Sophia in 
her tent, while her husband, bushy- 
haired Edward, was speaking with 
me about a fence to be buik around 
the tent. The Devil grabbed her 
arm, and she cried out for You 
to save her, and Edward and I 
ran to her. Edward fell upon the 
Devil and was taken by the long 
fingers of the Devil, and his head 
was twisted and blood ran from 
his mouth and his eyes were taken 
from his head 'by the Devil’s talons. 

**The Devil took Sophia’s hand 
from her arm and held it in his 
mouth and carried the body of 



Edward away. I damned the Devil 
back to Hell and sent it away with 
a blow from a shovel on its left 
arm, but it did not free Edward 
from its grasp. The Devil’s life-blood 
ran greasy as it returned to its king- 
dom. 

“We cannot imderstand how we 
have sinned so greatly that the Devil 
may visit us unrestrained by Your 
hands. Though the human imper- 
fections in us fight patience, we still 
try to remain patient and pray for 
understanding.” 

C4j^ear Meah-Trin, Gods of All: 

U We were a hundred when 
we descended from the skies into 
the Gorge of Our Arrival, and now 
we are fifty imder the damned 
moons of the new world’s night. 

“It was not the Devil that took 
Thomas’ wife and visited Sophia and 
took her husband, but rather it was 
only one of many of the Devil’s 
helpers. Five of us saw demons of 
the same centaurean form last night, 
in different places, at different times. 
Perhaps there are a hundred of 
these helpers around, day and night. 

“Dear Meah-Trin, I am very 
afraid for Elizabeth. 

“Today stocky Morgan cried out 
in blasphemy that we were blind, 
that we were counseled by the Devil 
when we decided to leave Earth 
and come to this hell of sister sims. 
Morgan screamed that there are no 
Gods here. Then he began to weep, 
and all of us believed that You had 
spoken to him and 'that he was re- 
penting with sacred tears for his 
blasphemy. But dien in the evening 
Morgan went to the swamp mud 



GODS Of THE DARK AND LIGHT 



53 




ami laugtied in madjiess and sank 
himself into the dairkness. 

“I pray that You forgive us our 
sins, of which we are so ignorant, 
and that You enlighten us as to our 
sins so that we ocnight know them 
and understand this new world is 
one of pain and punishment to us.” 

4 4 ear Meah-Trin, Gods of All: 
Scar-faced Bamal told me 
today that small flames are bom 
from the ground near the tents. He 
said that many times he has watched 
a small crevasse in the ground and 
seen a fire >bom in it. St^vrp-minded 
James thinks that it might be nat- 
ural gas igniting upon striking the 
air, but most of us must believe that 
it is die Devil’s doing. 

**Swamp wood was used to build 
a fence around the tents, but still 
the Devil’s demons have taken nine 
more of us; and the tents smeU of 
rotting blood, and small rodents chew 
and suck the drying blood at night 
if it is not buried under a layer 
of dirt. 

“We wait and pray for Your 
word, but many of our minds are 
imprisoned by the pains of our 
bodies and hearts and are moulded 
into confusion by the pains of this 
new world.” 

44/^ Gods of the moons and suns 
and stink^ater and hard- 
ground and dark and light — the 
new meat brings happiness to our 
stomachs, but I am f^ed with fear 
for my waim-mate and small-young. 
I can smell the fresh blood of one 
of us — a young buck — near 
the living grounds of the new meat. 



O Gods, 1 cannot understand this 
new meat, and 1 have begun fear- 
ing.” 

44T^^^ Meah-Trin: A Devil’s 
JL/ helper was killed today near 
the fence by four of the remain- 
ing thirty of us. I was one of the 
many who cut at it a hundred times 
with hatred in my heart, and who 
threw its greasy life-blood onto the 
rocks, and who took its bat-skin 
and tied it to a pole. We repented 
for our pagan feelings and actions 
later, but we have begun to sin in 
innumerable ways without repent- 
ence, for our minds are tortured 
and raw, and blind to the words 
we once knew from You. 

“There has not been a meeting 
in two weeks. There are only four 
of us who still live with our re- 
sp^ive husbands and wives. 1 will 
attempt the organizaitioii of a hymn- 
al meeting so that we may lift 
our voices to You. But long-boned 
Thomas sleeps in a tent with two 
women now, and does not come out 
except to blaspheme against You 
and to hei^ gather the crops of 
vegetables we now depend on. 

“We pray for some word from 
You, but many of us fear that there 
was some truth in stocky Morgan’s 
words.” 

44/^ Gods of the dark and light 
and meat — I cannot be 
thankful today. My warm-mate and 
small-young were attacked and kill- 
ed in our home-cave by the new 
meat you sent. O Gods, I will find 
another mate and young, but these 
were my first. I do not feel like 



54 



IF 




eating any more of the new meat 
yon sent. I do not understand why 
you send us meat that attacks us. 

“I saw the new meat running 
among our home-caves and saw 
them kill four bucks. I will find 
a new mate, and we will come to be 
happy in time, hut I do not under- 
stand you, O Gods.” 

tt'rxear Meah-Trin: I have re- 

-L/ framed from praying to You 
for three weeks, because one of the 
Devil’s helpers carried Elizabeth 
away and left only her foot with 
three toes remaining. I loved Eliza- 
beth, but the grief has been lessened 
by time so that I am now able to 
pray to You again. I am now living 
in a tent with azure-eyed Sophia, 
whose hand is healing fairly well. 
I feel that perhaps understanding of 
You in this new world will come 
to all of us soon. 

“We moved our camp to a place 
where only a few fires can continue 
to singe our legs and tents. Sharp- 
minded James discovered a herb 
that can be ground up and spinkled 
on us and in the tents to keep the 
maggots and leeches away. The 
Devil’s helpers have not returned, 
because twelve men of our colony 
took shovels and torches and found 
the demons in their lairs among the 
rocks and killed them and brought 
back the skins of forty-eight of 
them. There were three different 
colors of skins, seeming to be ac- 
cording to the demons’ ages. I have 
a medium-sized bluish skin hanging 
over the entrance to our tent. 

“I believe that understanding of 
You will come soon, because new 



things are taking place in us these 
days. Long-boned Thomas came 
from his tent of three women and 
told us of the things he had learned 
from You in his dreams. He took 
a torch from the fire that is born 
from the ground and burnt his 
hand before our eyes, and his women 
kissed his hand, and Thomas cried 
out that it was wonderful to feel 
the fire and to know that he lived 
in the new world. One of his wom- 
en took the stinging cattails that 
grow in the swamp and whipped 
her face with them, and then she 
cried out to You that it was good 
to feel the sting ahd to know that 
she had to face to feel and eyes to 
see the new world.” 

4 4 ear Meah-Trin: Tall, long- 

-L^ boned Thomas talked to all 
of us today about the New Rules 
Vitae You gave him while he was 
sleeping. He cried out to us that 
You have bidden us Feel Fire, Feel 
Sting, Feel Blood, Feel Cold, and 
the all important rule. Feel AM the 
Pain of the New World, because 
this new world You have given us 
is a world of pain. 

“Thomas was glorious today. He 
no longer sorrows for Barbara. 

“Many of us did not believe in 
the New Rules Vitae when they first 
heard them. So Thomas brought 
forth his four women, and one was 
without clothing, and all of us 
were ashamed. Thomas made her 
lie down on a bed of stinging cat- 
tails, and she cried out and tears 
ran from her eyes. She cried out 
how wonderful her pain was, and 
that You were speaking to her with 



GODS OF THE DARK AND LIGHT 



55 




wonderful words as she felt the 
pain, and that all of us would hear 
and know You once again if we 
obeyed the New Rules of the New 
World. 

‘Today long-boned leader Thomas 
and three other men took a small 
live Devil’s helper — the first one 
we have seen since we placed the 
skins on poles like flags — and 
tied its jaw shut and dulled its 
talons wi^ stone, and took Belinda, 
wife of demon-killer Jason, and tied 
the beast to her side. The demon 
drew blood with its hooves, and ^e 
cried out thanksgiving to You. The 
demon nuzzled its jaws into her ribs 
with hellish ferocity, tugging at its 
bonds and desiring to taste her life- 
blood, and to condemn her soul to 
Hell. Because of the muzzle, Be- 
linda’s life-blood was not blackened 
in the grease^it of the demon’s 
belly, and her spirit was cleansed 
and the Devil’s wish was thwarted. 

“Azure-«yed, soft-voiced Sophia 
wants to hear and know You, as 
all of 118 do now, and she eame 
to me this morning to say that we 
should soon be wed in the New 



World, under the New Rules Vitae. 
So we will be wed tomoirow at 
the hymnal meeting. 

‘Tomorrow, when Thomas mar- 
ries us with the stinging cattails and 
heated demon’s bone and maggots, 
we will all sing the New Hynm of 
Thomas the Prophet: 

Gods of All, fo Thee we raise 

Our voice in love of painful days. 

“Tomorrow will be a glorious 
meeting, because five of us will take 
the last steps toward becoming One 
with You. As You instructed 
Thomas to have us do, we have 
gathered thick swamp wood beams 
to form crosses and have made nails 
from the metal of our shovels. 

“Tomorrow in the sun, high above 
the ground, we will Feel Pain. We 
have no fear diat the others will let 
us die, for they know that our 
children have yet to be bom and 
nurtured by this New World of 
Pain. After all, we came to this 
world in the beginning for the sake 
of our children. They will grow 
to know You and to love this Nw 
World. END

A s Second Secretary of Embassy 
Jame Retief stepped from die 
lighter which had delivered the Ter- 
ran Mission to the close-cropped 
turquoise sward of the planet Zoon, 
a rabbit-sized creature upholstered 
in deep blue-violet angora bounded 
into view from behind an upthrust 
slab of scarlet granite. It sat on its 
oddly-arranged haunches a few yards 
from the newcomers, twitching an 
assortment of members as though 
testing the air for a clue to their

cnigin. First Secretary Magnan’s 
•arrow face registered apprehension 
as a second furry animal, this one 
a yard-wide sphere of indigo fuzz, 
came hopping around the prow of 
the vessel. 

“Do you suppose they bite?” 

“They’re obviously grass-eaters,” 
Colonel Smartfinger, the military 
attache, stated firmly. “Probably 
naake most affectionate pets. Here, 
ah, kitty, kitty.” He snapped his 
fmgers and whistled. More bunnies 
appeared. 

“Ah — Colonel.” The agricul- 
tural attache touched bis sleeve. “If 
I’m not mistaken, those are imma- 
ture specimens of the planet’s dom- 
inant life form!” 

ii'n'h?” Oldtrick pricked up his 
ears. “These animals? Im- 
possible!” 

“They look just like the high- 
resolution photos the Sneak-and- 
peek teams took. My, aren’t there a 
lot of them!” 

“Well, possibly this is a sort of 
playground for them. Cute little fel- 
lows.” Oldtrick paused to kick one 
which had opened surprising jaws 
for a nip at his ankle. 

“That’s the worst of these cra^ 
operations.” The economic officer 
shied as a Terrier-sized fur-bearer 
darted in close and crunched a shiny 
plastic button from the cuff of his 
mauve, late nndnK>rning, semi-in- 
formal hip-^huggers. “Oiae never 
knows just what one may ‘be get- 
ting into.” 

“Oh-oh.” Magnan nudged Retief 
as a technician bustled from the 
lock, heavy-laden. “Here comes the 



classified equipment the ambassa- 
dor’s been sitting on since we left 
Sector HQ.” 

“Ah!” Ambassador Oldtrick rub- 
bed his small, well manicured hands 
briskly toge^er, lifted an article 
resembling a Mae West life jacket 
from the stack offered. 

“Here, gentlemen, is my personal 
contribution to, ahem, high-^levcl 
negotiations!” He smiled proudly 
and slipped his arms through a loop 
of woven plastic. “One^an, self- 
contained, power-^boosted aerial lift 
units,” he announced. “With these, 
gentlemen, we will confront the elu- 
sive Zooner on his home ground!” 

“But — the post report said the 
Zooners are a sort of animated 
blimp!” the Information Officer pro- 
tested. “Only a few of them have 
been seen, and those were cruising 
at high altitude! Surely we’re not 
going after themV^ 

“It was inevitable, gentlemen.” 
Oldtrick winced as the technician 
tugged the harness strap tight across 
his narrow chest. “Sooner or later 
man was 'bound to encounter lighter- 
tban-air intelligence — a confronta- 
tion for which we of the Corps 
Diplomatique Terrestrienne are emi- 
nently well qualified!” 

“But, your excellency,” First Sec- 
retary Magnan spoke up. “Couldn’t 
we have arranged to confront these, 
er, gaseous brains here on solid 
land?” 

iC'VTonsense, Magnan! Give up 
this superb opportunity to 
display the adaptability of the train- 
ed diplomat? Since these beings 
dwell among the clouds ef their

IF 




aative world, what more convincing 
evidence of good will could we dis- 
play than to meet them on their 
own grounds, so to speak?” 

“Of course,” the corpulent Poli- 
tical Officer put in, “we aren’t 
actually sure there’s anyone up 
there.” He squinted nervously up 
at the lacy mass of land-coral that 
reached into the Zoonian sky, its 
lofty pinnacles brushing a seven- 
thousand-foot stratum of cumulo- 
nimbus. 

“That’s where we’ll steal a march 
on certain laggards,” Oldtrick stat- 
ed imperhirbably. ‘The survey pho- 
tos clearly show the details of a 
charming aerial city nestled on the 
reef. Picture the spectacle, gentle- 
men, when the Mission descends on 
them from the blue empyrean to 
open a new era of Terran-Zoon rela- 
tions!” 

“Yes — a striking mis en scene 
indeed, as your Excellency points 
out.” The economic officer’s cheek 
gave a nervous twitch. “But what if 
something goes wrong with the ap- 
paratus? The steering mechanism, 
for example, appears a trifle in- 
substantial — ” 

“These devices were designed and 
constructed under my personal 
supervision, Chester,” the ambassa- 
dor cut him off coolly. “However,” 
he continued, “don’t allow that cir- 
cumstance to prevent you fiom 
pointing out any conceptual flaws 
you may have detected,” 

“A marvel of lightweight ingen- 
unity,” ithe economic officer said 
hastily. “I only meant . ” 

“Chester’s point was just that 
maybe some of us ought to wait here. 



Mr. Ambassador,” the military at- 
tache said. “In case any, ah, late 
dispatches come in from Sector, 
or something. Much as I’ll hate to 
miss participating, I volunteer — ” 
‘‘Kindly rebuckie your harness. 
Colonel,” Oldtrick said through 
thinned lips. “I wouldn’t dream of 
allowing you to make the sacrifice.” 
“Good Lord, Retief,” Magnan 
said in a hoarse whisper behind his 
hand. “Do you suppose these little 
tiny things will actually work? And 
does he really mean ...” Mag- 
nan’s voice trailed off as he stared 
up into the bottomless sky. 

‘‘He really means,” Retief con- 
firmed. “As for his Excellency’s in- 
vention, I suppose diat given a large- 
diameter, low-density planet with 
a standard mass of 4.8 and a sur- 
face G of .72, plus an atmospheric 
pressure of 27.5 P. S. I. and a 
super-light gas — it’s possible.” 

“I was afraid of that,” Mag- 
nan muttered. “I don’t suppose that 
if we all joined together and took 
a firm line . ?” 

“Might be a savings at that,” Re- 
tief nodded judiciously. “The whole 
staff could be court-martialed as a 
group.” 

“ . and now,” Ambassador Old- 
trick’s reedy voice paused impres- 
sively as he settled his iberet firmly 
in place. 

“If you’re ready, gentlemen — in- 
flate your gasbags!” 

A sharp hissing started up as a 
dozen petcocks opened as one. 
Bright-colored plastic bubbles in- 
flated with sharp popping sounds 
above the shoulders of the Terran

diplomats. The ambassador gave a 
little spring and bounded high above 
the heads of his staff, where he 
hung, supported by the balloon, 
assisted by a softly snorting bat- 
tery of air jets buckled across his 
hips. 

Colonel Smartfinger, a large 
bony man, gave a half-hearted leap, 
fell back, his toes groping for con- 
tact as a gust of air bumbled him 
across the ground. Magnan, lighter 
than the rest, made a creditable 
spring and rose to dangle beside the 
chief of mission. Retief adj-usted his 
buoyancy indicator carefully, jump- 
ed off as the rest of the staff 
scrambled to avoid the questionable 
distinction of being the last man air- 
borne. 

“Capital, gentlemen!” Oldtrick 
beamed at the others as they drifted 
in a ragged row, roped together like 
alpinists, five yards above the sur- 
face. “I trust each of you is ready 
to savor the thrill of breaking new 
ground!” 

“An unfortunate turn of phrase,” 
Magnan quavered, looking down at 
the rocky outcropping below. The 
grassy plain on which the lighter 
had deposited the mission stretched 
away to the horizon, interrupted 
only by the upthrusting coral reefs 
dotted across it like lonely castles 
in the Daliesque desert and a dis- 
tant smudge of smoky green. 

“And now — onward to what 
I hope I may, without charges of 
undue jocularity, term a new high 
in diplomacy,” Oldtrick cried. He 
advanced his jet control fever and 
lifted skyward, trailed by the mem- 
bers of his staff. 



II 

F ive hundred feet aloft, Magnan 
clutched the arm of Retief, oc- 
cupying the adjacent position in the 
line. 

“The lighter is lifting off!” He 
pointed to the slim shape of the 
tiny Corps vessel, drifting upward 
from the sands below. “It’s abandon- 
ing us!” 

“A mark of the ambassador’s con- 
fidence that we’ll meet with a hos- 
pitable reception at the hands of the 
Zooners,” Retief pointed out. 

“Frankly, I’m at a loss to under- 
stand Sector’s eagerness to accredit 
a mission to this wasteland.” Mag- 
nan raised his voice above the 
whistling of the sharp wind and the 
polyphonous huffing of the jato 
units. “Retief, you seem to have a 
way of picking up odd bits of in- 
formation. Any idea what’s behind 
it?” 

“According to a usually reliable 
source, the Groaci have their eyes 
on Zoon — all five of them. Natur- 
ally, if they’re interested, the Corps 
has to beat them to it.” 

“Aha!” Magnan looked wise. 
“They must know something. By 
the way,” he edged closer. “Who 
told you? The ambassador? The 
undersecretary?” 

“Better than that; the bartender 
at the departmental snackbar.” 
“Well, I daresay our five-eyed 
friends will receive a sharp sur- 
prise when they arrive to find us 
already on a cordial basis with the 
locals. Unorthodox though Ambas- 
sador Oldtrick’s technique may be. 
I’m forced to concede that it ap-

IF 




pears the only way we could have 
approached these Zooners.” He 
craned upward at the fanciful for- 
mation of many-^fingered rock past 
which they were rising. “Odd that 
none of them have sallied forth to 
greet us.” 

Relief followed his gaze. “We 
still have six thousand feet to go,” 
he said. “I suppose we’ll find a suit- 
able reception waiting at the top.” 

H alf an hour later, Ambassador 
Oldtrick in the lead, the party 
soared above the final rampart to 
look down on a wonderland of rose 
and pink violet coral, an intricacy of 
spires, tunnels, bridges, grottos, tur- 
rets, caves, avenues, as complex and 
delicately fragile as spun sugar. 

“Carefully, now, gentlemen.” Old- 
trick twiddled his jato control, 
dropped in to a gentle landing on 
a graceful arch spanning a cleft full 
of luminous gloom produced by the 
filtration of light through the trans- 
lucent construction. His staff set- 
tled in nearby, gazing with awe at 
the minarets rising all around them. 

The ambassador, having twisted 
a knob to deflate his gasbag and laid 
aside his flying harness, was frown- 
ing as he looked about the silent 
prospect. 

“I wonder where the inhabitants 
have betaken themselves?” He lift- 
ed a finger, and six eager underlings 
sprang to his side. 

“Apparently the natives are a tri- 
fle shy, gentlemen,” he stated. “Nose 
around a bit. Look friendly. And 
avoid poking into any possibly ta- 
boo areas such as temples and pub- 
lic comfort stations.” 



Leaving their deflated gasbags 
heaped near their point of anival, 
the Terrans set about peering into 
caverns and clambering up to ga^ 
along twisting alleyways wisding 
among silent coral palaces. Retief 
followed a narrow path atop a ridge 
which curved upward to a point of 
vantage. Magnan trailed, mopping 
at his face with a scented tissue. 

“Apparently no one’s at home,” 
he puffed, coming up to the tiny 
platform from which Relief sur- 
veyed the prospect spread bdow. 
“A trifle disconcerting, I must say. 
I wonder what sort of arrangements 
have been laid on for feeding and 
housing us?” 

“Another odd thing,” Relief said. 
“No empty beer bottles, tin cans, 
old newspapers, or fruit rinds. In 
fact, no signs of haibitation at aH.” 

“It rather appears we’ve been 
stood up,” the economic officer said 
indignantly. “Such cheek — and 
from a pack of animated intangibles, 
at thatl” 

“It’s my opinion the town’s ibeen 
evacuated,” the political officer said 
in the keen tones of one deliver- 
ing an incisive analysis of a omn- 
plex situation. “We may as well 
leave.” 

“Nonsense!” Oldtrick snapped. 
“Do you expect me to trot back to 
Sector and announce that I can’t 
find the government to which I’m 
accredited?” 

44/^reat heavens!” Magnan blink- 
ed at a lone dark cloud 
drifting ominously closer under fhe 
high overcast. “I thou^t I sensed 
something impending. Uh, Mr. Am-

bassador!” he called, startiiig back 
down. At that moment, a cry from 
an adjacent cavern focused ^ eyes 
on the military attache, emerging 
with a short length of what appeared 
to be tarred rope, charred at one 
end. 

“Signs of life, Your Excellancy!” 
he announced. “A dope-stick butt!” 
He sniffed it. “Freshly smoked.** 
“Dope-sticks! Nonsense!’* Oldtrick 
prodded the exhibit with a stubby 
forefinger. “I’m sure the Zooners 
are far too insubstantial to indulge 
in such vices.” 

“Ah, Mr. Ambassador,” Magnan 
called. “I suggest we all select a 
nice dry cave and creep inside, out 
of the .weather — ” 

“Cave? Creep? Weather? What 
weather?” Oldtrick rounded on the 
First Secretary as he came up. 
“I’m here to establish diplomatic 
relations with a newly discovered 
race, not set up housekeeping!” 
“r/iat weather,” Magnan said stiff- 
ly, pointing at the giant cloud sweep- 
ing swiftly down on them at a level 
which threatened to shroud the party 
in a fog in a matter of minutes. 

“Eh? Oh.” Oldtrick stared at the 
approadiing thunderhead. “Yes, well, 
I was about to suggest we seek 
shelter.** 

“What about the dope-stick?” The 
colonel tried to recapture the lime- 
light. “We hadn’t finished looking 
at my dope-stick when Magnan 
came along with his cloud.” 

“My cloud is of considerably 
more urgency than your dope-stick. 
Colonel,” Magnan said softly. “Par- 
ticulaily since, as his excellency 
has pointed out, your little find 



couldn’t possibly be the property of 
the Zooners.” 

“Ha! WeU if it isn’t the pro- 
perty of the Zooners, then ^ose 
is it?” The officer looked at the 
butt suspiciously, passed it around. 
Relief glanced at it, sniffed it. 

“I believe you’ll find this to be 
Groaci manufacture. Colonel,” he 
said. 

4 4TT^hat?” Oldtrick clapped a 
VV hand to his forehead. “Im- 
possible! Why, I myself hardly know 
— that is, they couldn’t — mean 
to say, drat it, the location of this 
world is Utter Top Secret!” 

“Ahem.” Magnan glanced up com- 
placently at his cloud now a bat- 
tle-ship-sized shape only a few hun- 
dred feet distant. “I wonder if it 
mightn’t be as well to hurry along 
now before we find ourselves drench- 
ed.” 

“Good Lord!” The political offi- 
cer stared at the gray-black mass 
as it moved across the hazy sun, 
blotting it out like an eclipse. In 
the sudden shadow, the wind was 
abruptly chill. The cloud was above 
the far edge of the reef now; as 
they watched, it dropped lower, 
brushed across a projecting digit of 
stone with a dry squee!, sent a show- 
er of tiny rock fragments showering 
down. Magnan jumped and blinked 
his eyes hard, twice. 

“Did you see ... ? Did / 
see ... ?” 

Dropping lower, the cloud sailed 
between two lofty minarets, scraped 
across a lower tower topped with a 
series of sharp spikes. There was 
a ripping sound, a crunch of stone.

a sharp powU a blattering noise of 
escaping gas. A distinct odor of 
rubberized canvas floated across to 
the diplomats, borne by the brisk 
breeze. 

“Ye Gods!” The military attache 
shouted. “That’s no cloud! It’s a 
Trojan horse! A dirigible in camou- 
flage! A trick!” He cut off and 
turned to run as the foundering 
four-acre balloon swung, canted 
at a sharp angle, and thundered 
down amid gratings and crunchings, 
crumbling bridges, snapping off 
slender towers, settling in to blanket 
the landscape like a collapsed circus 
tent. A small, agile creature in a 
flared helmet and a black hip-cloak 
appeared at its edge, wading across 
the deflated folds of the counter- 
feit cloud, cradling a formidable 
blast gun in its arms. Others fol- 



lowed, leaping down and scamper- 
ing for strategic positions on the 
high ground surrounding the Ter- 
rans. 

' “Groaci shock troops!” the Mili- 
tary Attache shouted. “Run for your 
lives!” 

He dashed for the concealment of 
a shadowy canyon; a blast from a 
Groaci gun sent a cloud of coral 
chips after him. Retief, from a 
position in the lee of a buttress 
of rocks, saw half a dozen of the 
Terrans skid to a halt at the re- 
port, put up their hands as the 
invaders swarmed around them, 
hissing soft Groaci sibilants. Three 
more Terrans, attempting flight, 
were captured within fifty feet, 
prodded back at gunpoint. A 
moment later a sharp oof! and a 
burst of military expletives an- 
nounced the surrender of Colonel 
Smartfinger. Retief made his way 
around a rock spire, spotted Am- 
bassador Oldtrick being routed from 
his hiding place behind a cactus- 
shaped outcropping. 

^C^lXTell, fancy meeting you 
VV here, Hubert.” A slightly 
built, splendidly dressed Groaci 
strolled forward, puffing at a dope- 
stick held in silver tongs. “I regret 
to submit you to the indignity of 
being trussed up like a Gerp-fowl in 
plucking season, but what can one 
expect when one commits an ag- 
gravated trespass, eh?” 

•Trespass? I’m here in good faith 
as Terran envoy to Zoon!” Oldtrick 
sputtered. “S^ here. Ambassador 
Shish, this is an outrage! I demand 
you order these bandits to release 



me and my staff at once! Do you 
understand?’* 

“Field Marshal Shish, if you 
please, Hubert,” Shish whispered. 
‘These are a duly constituted con- 
stabulary. If you annoy me, I may 
just order them to exercise the full 
rigor of the law which you have so 
airily disregarded!” 

“What law?” Your confounded 
dacoits have assaulted peaceful dip- 
lomats in peaceful pursuit of their 
duties!” 

“Interplanetary law, my dear sir,” 
Shish hissed. “That section deal- 
ing with territorial claims to un- 
inhabited planets.” 

“But — but the Zooners inhabit 
Zoon!” 

“So? An exhaustive search of the 
entire planetary surface by our 
Scouting Service failed to turn up 
any evidence of intelligent habita- 
tion.” 

“Surface? But the Zooners don’t 
occupy the surface!” 

“Exactly. Therefore w^e have as- 
sumed ownership. Now, about re- 
parations and damages in connec- 
tion with your release. I should 
think a million credits would be 
about right — paid directly to me, 
of course, as Planetary Military 
Governor, pro tern" 

“A million?” Oldtrick swallowed 
hard. “But . but ... see here!” 
He fixed Shish with a desperate 
eye. “What is it you fellows are 
after? This isn’t the kind of sandy- 
dry real estate you Groaci prefer 
— and the world has no known 
economic or strategic value.” 
“Hmmm.” Shish flicked his dope- 
stick butt aside. “No harm in tell- 



64 



IF 




ing you, I suppose. We intend to 
gather a crop.” 

“Crop? There’s nothing growing 
here but blue grass and land coral I” 

4 4T7^rong again, Hubert. The 
VV crop that interests us is 
this ...” He fingered the edge of 
his shaggy violet cape. “A luxury 
fur, light, colorful, nonallergic.” He 
lowered his voice and leered with 
three eyes. “And with reportedly 
fabulous aphrodisiac effects; and 
there are millions of credits worth 
of it, leaping about the landscape 
below, free for the harvesting!” 

“But surely you jest, sir! Those 
are — ” 

There was a sudden flurry as one 
of the Terrans broke free and dashed 
for a cave. The Groaci constabu- 
lary gave chase. Shish made an 
annoyed sound and hurried away to 
oversee the recapture. Oldtrick, left 
momentarily alone, eyed the flying 
harnesses lying in a heap ten yards 
from him. He took a deep breath, 
darted forward, snatched up a har- 
ness. 

As he turned to sprint for cover, 
a breathy cry announced his dis- 
covery. Desperately, the chief of 
mission struggled into his straps as 
he ran, twisted the valve, fir^ his 
jato units and shot into the air above 
the heads of a pair of fleet-footed 
aliens who had been about to lay 
him by the heels. He passed over 
Reliefs head at an altitude of 
twenty feet, driven smartly by the 
brisk breeze. Relief ducked his head, 
hugged the shadows as Groaci feet 
pounded past at close range, pur- 
suing the fleeting Terran. Relief saw 



half a dozen marksmen taking aim 
at the airborne diplomat as the wind 
swept him out over the reefs* edge* 
Shots rang. There was a sharp re- 
port as a round pierced the gasibag. 
With a despairing wail, the Am- 
bassador sank swiftly out of sight. 

Relief rolled to his feet, ran to 
the pile of flight harnesses, grabbed 
up two, whirled and sprinted for the 
edge over which Oldtrick had van- 
ished. Two Groaci, turning to con- 
front the new menace descending on 
their rear, were bowled aside by Re- 
liefs rush. Another sprang to in- 
tercept him, bringing his gun around. 
Relief caught the barrel in full stride, 
swung the gun with its owner still 
clinging desperately to it, slammed 
the unfortunate alien into the faces of 
his astounded comrades. Shots split 
the air past Relief’s ear, but without 
slowing, he charged to the brink 
and dived over into seven thousand 
feet of open air. 

Ill 

T he uprushing wind shrieked past 
Reliefs ears like a typb^n. 
Gripping one of the two harnesses 
in his teeth, he pulled the other on 
as one would don a vest, buckled 
the straps. He looked down, squint- 
ing against the rush of air. 

The ambassador, falling free now 
with his burst balloon fluttering 
at his back, was twenty feet below. 
Relief tucked his arms close, kicked 
his heels up to assume a diver’s 
attitude. The distance between the 
two men lessened. The rock face 
flashed past, dangerously close. Re- 
lief’s hand brushed Oldtrick’s foot. 



FOREST IN THE SKY

The ambassador twisted convulsive- 
ly to roll a wild eye at Retief, 
suspended above him in the hurtling 
airstream. Retief caught the senior 
diplomat’s arm, shoved the spare 
harness into his hand. A moment 
later Oldtrick had shed his ruined 
gasbag and shrugged into the re- 
placement. 

With a twist of the petcock, he 
inflated his balloon and at once 
slowed, falling behind Retief, who 
opened his own valve, felt the sud- 
den tug of the harness. A moment 
later, he wa^ floating lightly a hun- 
dred feet b^ow the ambassador, 
who was driftihg ^gently closer. 

“Quick thinking, my boy,” Old- 
trick’s voice came faintly. “As soon 
as I’m aboard the transport, I shall 
summon a heavy PE unit to deal 
with those ruffians! We’ll thwart 
their inhuman scheme to massacre 
helpless infant Zooners, thus en- 
dearing ourselves to their elders!” 
He was close now, dropping as Re- 
tief rose. “You’d better come along 
with me,” he said sharply as they 
passed, ten feet apart. “I’ll 
want your corroborative statements, 
and — ” 

“Sorry, Mr. Ambassador,” Retief 
said. “I seem to have gotten hold of 
a heavy-duty unit. It wants to go 
up, and the valve appears to be 
stuck.” 

“Come back,” Oldtrick shouted 
as he dropped away below the 
younger man. “I insist that you 
accompany me!” 

“I’m afraid it’s out of my hands 
now, sir,” Retief called. “I suggest 
you stay out of sight of any colonist 
who may have settled in down be- 



low. I have an idea they’ll be a 
little trigger happy when they dis- 
cover their police force is stranded 
on the reef, and a dangling diplo- 
mat will make a tempting target.” 

T he southwest breeze bore Re- 
tief along at a brisk twenty- 
mile-per-hour clip. He twisted the 
buoyancy control lever both ways, 
to no avail. The landscape dwindled 
away below him, a vast spread of 
soft aquamarine hills. 

From this height, immense herds 
of creatures were visible, ranging 
in color from pale blue to deep 
grapejuice. They appeared, Retief 
noted, to be converging on a point 
not far from the base of the coral 
reef, where a number of black dots 
might have been small structures. 
Then the view was obscured, first 
by whipping streamers of fog, then 
by a dense, wet mist which enveloped 
him like a cool, refreshing Turkish 
bath. 

For ten minutes he swirled blind- 
ly upward; then watery sunshine 
penetrated, lighting the vapor to 
a golden glow; a moment later he 
burst through into brilliance. A deep 
blue sky arched above the blinding 
white cloud-plain. Squinting against 
the glare, he saw a misty shape of 
pale green projecting above the 
clouds at a distance he estimated at 
five miles. Using steering jets, he 
headed for it. 

Fifteen minutes later, he was 
close enough to make out thick, 
glossy yellow columns, supporting 
masses of chartreuse foliage. Closer, 
the verdure resolved into clusters of 
leaves the size of tablecloths, among

which gaudy blossoms dione scariet. 

In the leafy depths, the sun strik- 
ing down from zeni^ was filtered 
to a deep, green-gold gloom. Re- 
tief maneuvered toward a stuidy- 
looking branch, only at the last 
moment saw the yard-long thorns 
concealed in the shadow of the 
spreading leaves. He ducked, twisted 
aside from the savage stab of a 
needle-point, heard the rip and ker- 
pow! as his ga^ag burst, impaled; 
then be slammed bard against a 
thigh-thick, glass-«mooth branch, 
grabbed with both bands and both 
legs, and braked to a halt inches 
from an upthrust dagger of horny 
wood. 

A ll around, life swarmed, hum- 
ming, buzzing, chattering in a 
hundred oddly euphonious keys. 
There were fluffy, spherical bird- 
things in vivid colors; darting scaled 
runners* like jeweled ferrets; swartns 
of tiny golden four-winged butter- 
flies. Once something hooted, far 
away, and for a moment the chorus 
was stilled to resume a moment later. 

Loddng down, Retief could see 
nothing but level afte^ level of 
leafy branches, blotting out the 
swirling clouds two hundred feet 
below. The ground, he estimated, 
was a mile and a half farther — 
not what could be described as an 
easy dimb. Still, it looked like 
the only way. He divested himself 
of the ruined altitude harness, pick- 
ed a route and started down. 

Retief had covered no more than 
fifty feet when a sudden flurry of 
motion caught ins eye tiirough the 
foliage. A moment later, a clump 



of leaves leaned aside, pushed by 
a gust of wind, to reveal a bulky, 
ghost-pale creature, its body covert 
with short white bristles, its head 
a flattened spheroid. Its multiple 
shiny back limbs threshed wildly 
against the restraint of a web of 
silky, scarlet threads, stretched be- 
tween limbs in an intricate spird 
pattern. A flat pouch, secured by 
a flat strap, bobbed against the 
trapped creature’s side. The web, 
Retief saw, was constructed at the 
very tip of a pair of long boughs 
which leaned in a deep curve under 
the weight of the victim — and of 
something else. 

Peering into the shadows, he saw 
a foot-long claw like a pair of over- 
sized garden shears poised in the 
air two feet from the trapped be- 
ing. Then he noted that the claw 
was attached to an arm like a six- 
foot length of stainless steel pipe, 
which ^as attached, in turn, Co a 
body encased in silvery-Wue annor 
plate, almost invisible in the leafy 
gloom. 

As Reti^ watdied, the aim lung- 
ed, beared through a cluster of 
awning-sized leaves, snipped off a 
tuft of stiff white hairs as the 
snared one made a desperate hound 
sideways. The aggressor, it appear- 
ed, had advanced as far along the 
fragile support as possible; but it was 
only a matter of time until the 
murderous pincer connected with its 
target. 

Retief checked his pockets, pro- 
duced a pocket knife with a two- 
inch blade, useful chiefly for cut- 
ting the tips from hand-rolled Jor- 
gensen cigars. He used it to saw

through a half-inch thick vine droop- 
ing near him. He coiled the rope 
over his shoulder and started back 
up. 

IV 

F rom a branch far above, Retief 
peered down through the leafy 
shadows at the twelve-foot mon- 
strosity that was clinging head down 
from a six-inch stem. The predator 
had stretched itself out to its ut- 
most length in its effort to reach 
the victim trapped below. 

Retief slid down to a crouch witii- 
in touching distance of the monster’s 
main hind leg. He flipped out the 
lariat he had fashioned hastily from 
the length of pliable vine, passed its 
end under the massive ankle joint, 
whipped it quickly into a slip knot 
which would tighten under pres- 
sure. He tied the other end of the 
rope to a sturdy bole at his back, 
pulling it up just short of taut. Then 
he slid around the trunk and head- 
ed back for the scene of the action, 
paying out a second rope, the end 
of which was secured to a stout 
limb. 

The trapped creature, huddled at 
the extreme extent of the rein given 
it by the binding strands of silk, 
saw Retief, gave a convulsive bound 
which triggered another snap of the 
claw. 

“Stand pat,” Retief called soft- 
ly. “I’ll try to distract his attention.” 
He stepped out on a slender branch, 
which sagged but held. Holding the 
end of the rope in his free hand, 
he made his way to within ten feet 
of the web. 



Above, the claw-creature, sensing 
movement nearby, poked out a glit- 
tering eye at the end of a -two-foot 
rod, studied Retief from a distaioce of 
five yards. Retief watched the claw, 
which hovered indecisively ready to 
strike in either direction. 

A baseball-sized fruit was grow- 
ing within easy reach. Retief phick- 
ed it, took air, and pitched it at the 
eye. It struck and burst, spattering 
the surrounding foliage with a sticky 
yellow goo and an odor of overripe 
melon. Quick as thought, the claw 
struck out straight at Retief as he 
jumped, gripping the vine, and 
swung in a graceful Tarzan-style arc 
across toward a handy landing plat- 
form thirty feet distant. The armored 
meat-eater, thwarted, lunged vainly 
after him. The sudden strain on the 
behemoth’s overextended grip was 
too much. There was a noisy rasping 
of metal-'hard hooks against wood, 
a frantic shaking of branches; then 
the barrel-shaped body came crash- 
ing down — and snapped to a halt 
with a tremendous jerk os the rope 
lashed to its leg came up short. 

Retief, safely lodged in his new 
platform, caught a momentary 
glimpse of an open mouth lined with 
Hanks of multipronged teeth. Then, 
with a sharp zongl the rope support- 
ing the monster parted. The ap- 
parition dropped away, smashing its 
way downward with a series of pro- 
gressively fainter concussions until 
it was lost in the depths below.

the strands of the web with his 
pocket knife. Freed, it di;^>ed into 
its hip-pouch with a fournfingeired 
*hand encased in a glove, ornamented 
with polished, inch4ong talons, 
brought out a small cylinder which 
it raised to its middle eye. 

'‘Hrikk/' it said in a soft rasp. 
A mouth like Jack Pumpkinhead 
gaped in an unreadable expression. 
There was a bright flash which made 
a green after-image dance on Re- 
lief’s retina. The alien dropped the 
object back in the pouch, took out 
a second artifact resembling a foot- 
long harmonica, which it adjusted 
on a loop around its neck. At once, 
it emitt^ a series of bleeps, toots 
and deep, resonant thrums, then 
looked at Relief in a way which 
seemed expectant. 

“If I’m not mistaken, that’s a 
Groaci electronic translator,” Re- 
lief said. “Trade goods like the 
camera, I presume?” - 

“Correct,” the device interpret- 
ed the small alien’s rasping tones. 
“By George, it works!” 

“The Groaci are second to none, 
when it comes to miniaturized elec- 
tronics and real-estate acquisition,” 
Relief said. 

“Real estate?” the Zoonite in- 
quired with a rising inflection. 

“Planetary surfaces,” Relief ex- 
plained. 

“Oh, that. Yes, I’d heard they’d 
settled in down below. No doubt a 
pregermination trauma’s at the root 
of the matter. But, every being to his 
, own form of self-destruction, as Zerd 
so succinctly put it ibefore he dis- 
solved himself in fuming nitric acid.” 
The alien’s button eyes roved over 



Retief. “Though I must say your 
own death-wish takes a curious 
form.” 

“Oh?” 

“Teasing a vine-jack for a start- 
er,” the Zoonite amplified. “That’s 
dangerous, you know. The claw can 
snip through six inches of gilv as 
though it were a zoob-patty.” 
“Actually, I got the impression 
the thing was after you,” Retief said. 

“Oh, it was, it was. Almost got 
me, too. Hardly worth the effort. 
I’d make a disappointing meal.” The 
Zoonite fingered its translator, the 
decorative claws clicking tinnily on 
the shiny plastic. “Am I to under- 
stand you came to my rescue in- 
tentionallyT* it said. 

R etief nodded. 

“Whatever for?” 

“On the theory that one intelli- 
gent being should keep another from 
being eaten alive, whenever he con- 
veniently can.” 

“Hmmm. A curious concept. And 
now I suppose you expect me to 
reciprocate?” 

“If it doesn’t inconvenience you,” 
Retief replied. 

“But you look so, so edible ...” 
Without warning, one of the alien’s 
ebon legs flashed out, talons spread, 
in a vicious kick. It was a fast 
stroke, but Retief was faster; shift- 
ing his weight slightly, he inter- 
cepted the other’s shin with the edge 
of his shoe, eliciting a sharp re- 
port. The Zooner yelped, simul- 
taneously lashed out, left-right, with 
a pair of arms — to meet painful 
interceptions as Retief struck up- 
ward at one with the edge of his

IF 




hand, down at the other. In the 
next instant, a small hand gun was 
pressing into the alien’s paunch- 
bristles. 

“We Terries are handy at small 
manufacturing, too,” Retief said 
easily. “This item is called a crater 
gun. You’ll understand why when 
you’ve seen it fired.” 

“ . but appearances can be so 
deceiving,” the Zoonite finished its 
interrupted sentence, wringing its 
numbed limbs. 

“A natural mistake,” Retief com- 
miserated. “Still, I’m sure you 
wouldn’t have found me any more 
nourishing than the vine-jack would 
have found you. Incompatible body 
chemistry, you know.” 

“Yes. Well, in that case, I may as 
well be off.” The Zooner backed 
a step. 

“Before you go,” Retief suggested, 
“there are some matters we might 
discuss to our mutual profit.” 

“Oh? What^ for example?” 

“The invasion of Zoon, for one, 
And ways and means of getting back 
back down to Zoona Firma for an- 
other.” 

“You are a compulsive. And it’s 
highly channelized neurosis: A vine- 
jack or my humble self won’t do; it 
has to be the hard ^ay.” 

“I’m afraid your translator is out 
of adjustment,” Retief said. “Hiat 
doesn’t seem to mean anything.” 

“I find your oblique approach a 
trifle puzzling, too,” the alien con- 
fided. “I sense that you’re trying 
to tell me something, but I can’t 
for the life of me guess what it 
might be. Suppose we go along to 
my place for an aperitif, and possib- 



ly we can enlighten each other. By 
the way, I’m known as Qoj, the 
Ready Biter.” 

“I’m Retief, the Occasional In- 
dulger,” the Terran said. “Lead the 
way, Qoj, and I’ll do my best to 
follow.” 

V 

I t was a breath-taking thirty- 
minute journey through the tow- 
ering tree tops. The alien progressed 
by long, curiously dreamlike leaps 
from one precarious rest to an- 
other, while Retief made his way 
as rapidly as possible along inter- 
lacing branches and bridges of tan- 
gled vine, keenly aware of the bot- 
tomless chasm yawning below. 

The trip ended at a hundred-foot 
spherical space where the growth 




FOREST IN THE SKY

had been cleared back to create 
a sliady, green-lit cavern. Bowers 
and leafy balconies were nestled 
around its periphery; tiny, fragile- 
looking terraces hung suspended un- 
der the shelter of sprays of giant 
fronds. 

There were several dozen Zoon- 
ers in sight, some lounging on 
the platforms or perched in stem- 
mounted chairs which swayed diz- 
zingly to the light breeze; others 
sailed gracefully from one roost 
to another, while a few hung by 
one or more limbs from festooning 
vines, apparently sleeping. 

“rU introduce you around,” the 
Zooner said. “Otherwise the fellows 
will be taking experimental cracks 
at you and getting themselves hurt. 
I’m against that, because an in- 
jured Zooner is inclined to be dis- 
agreeable company.” He flipped a 
switch on the translator and emit- 
ted a sharp cry. Zooner heads turn- 
ed. Qoj spieled off a short speech, 
waved a hand at Retief, who inhdined 
his head courteously. The locals 
eyed the Terran incuriously, went 
back to their previous activities. Qoj 
indicated a tiny table mounted atop 
a ten-foot rod, around which three 
small seats were arranged, similarly 
positioned. 

Retief hastily scaled the sup- 
port, took up his seat like a flag- 
pole sitter. Qoj settled in oppKwke 
him, the stem quivering and sway- 
ing under his weight. He whistl^ 
shrilly, and a black-spotted gray 
creature came sailing in a broad 
leap, took orders, bounded away, 
returned in a moment with aromatic 
flagons. 



4 4 4 h.” Qoj leaned back com- 
-^^ fortably witii two pairs of 
legs crossed. “Nothing like a litde 
bottled Nirvana, eh?” He lifted his 
flask and poured the contents in 
past a row of pronged, teeth rivaling 
those of the vine-jack. 

“Quite an interesting place you 
have here.” Retief unobtrusively 
sniffed his drink, sampled it. The 
fluid evaporated instantly on his 
tongue, * leaving a fruity aroma. 

“It’s well enough, I suppose,” 
Qoj assented, “under the circum- 
stances.” 

“What circumstances are those?” 
“Not enough to eat. Too many 
predators — like that fellow you 
dispatched. Cramped environment 
— no place to go. And of course, cut 
off as we are from raw materials, 
no hope for technological advance- 
ment. Let’s face it, Retief: we’re 
up the tree without a paddle.” 

Retief watched a bulky Zooner 
sail past in one of the feather-light 
leaps characteristic of the creatures. 

“Speaking of technology,” he 
said. “How do you manage that 
trick?” 

“What trick?” 

“You must weigh three hundred 
pounds — but when you want to, 
you float like a dandelion seed.” 
“Oh, that. Just an inhwent knack, 
I guess you’d call it. Even our 
spore-pods have it; otherwise, they’d 
smash when they hit the ground. 
It’s not much good for anything 
but short hops, you know.” 

“Organis anti^vity,” Retief said 
admiringly. “Or perhaps teleporta- 
tion would be a better name.” 
“The gland responds to mental im-

pulses,” Qoj said. “Fortunately, our 
young have no mentality to speak of, 
so they’re grounded. Otherwise we’d 
never have a moment’s peace.” 

He tossed another shot down his 
throat, lounging back in his diair 
as it swayed past Retief, rebounded 
to swing in the opposite direction, 
while Retief s perch waved in gentle 
counterpoint, a motion which tend- 
ed to cross the eyes and bring a 
light sweat to the forehead. 

“Oh. I wondered why there were 
no little ones gamboling about your 
doorstep,” Retief said. 

“Doorstep?” Qoj jerked upright 
and stared in alarm toward the 
shaded entrance to his bower. “Great 
slavering jaws, Retief, don’t give 
me a start like thatl The little mon- 
sters are down on the surface where 
they belongl” 

“Unattended?” 

Qoj shuddered. “I suppose we 
really ought to be doing something 
about them, but frankly — h’s too 
dangerous.” 

R etief raised an eyebrow in polite 
inquiry. 

“Why, the little fiends would strip 
the very crust off the planet if they 
weren’t able to assuage their voracity 
by eating each other.” 

“So that’s why you don’t occupy 
the surface.” 

“Um. If our ancestors hadn’t 
taken to the trees, we’d be extinct 
by now — devoured by our own off- 
spring,” 

“And I suppose your apparent in- 
difference (to the arrival of the 
Groad is based on the same reason- 
ing?” 



“Feeding season’s about to begin,” 
Qoj said offhandedly. “Those fel- 
lows won’t last a day. Not much 
juice in them, though — at least 
not in the one I met.” 

“That would be the previous own- 
er of the camera and the translator?” 
“Correct. Interesting chap. He was 
buzzing about an odd little contri- 
vance with whirling vanes on top 
and ran afoul a loop of string-vine. 
My, wasn’t he full of plans.” The 
Zooner sipped his flask, musing. 

“The Groaci, individually, don’t 
look like much. I’ll agree,” Retief 
said. “But they have a rather potent 
subnuclear arsenal at their com- 
mand. And it appears they’re about 
to launch a general offensive against 
your young.” 

“So? Maybe they’ll clear the lit- 
tle nuisances out. Then we can 
descend to the ground and start 
living like gentlebeings.” 

“What about the future of the 
race?” 

“J/iar for the future of the race.” 
Qoj made a complicated gesture with 
obscure biological implications. 
“We’re only concerned about our- 
selves.” 

“Still,” Retief countered, “you 
were young once.” 

“If you’re going to be crude,” 
the Zooner said with inebriated dig- 
nity, “you may leave me.” 

“Sure,” Retief said. “But before 
I go, would you mind describing 
these little fellows?” 

“In shape, they’re not unlike us 
adults; they come in all sizes, from 
this — ” Qoj held two talon^ fin- 
gers an inch apait — “to this.” He 
indicated a yard and a half. “And

of course, the baby fur. Ghastly blue 
fuzz a foot long.” 

“Did you say . blue?” 
“Blue.” 

Retief nodded thoughtfully. “You 
know, Qoj, I think we have the 
basis for a cooperative undertak- 
ing after all. If you’ll give me an- 
other five minutes of your time, 
I’ll explain it to you . ” 

VI 

F lanked by Qoj and another Zoo- 
ner named Omx the Eager Eat- 
er, Retief dropped down through the 
cloud layer, propelled by a softly 
hissing steering jet salvaged from 
his punctured lift harness. 

“That’s it, dead ahead,” he point- 
ed to the towering coral reef, pale 
rose-colored in the distance. 

“Wheel” Qoj squealed with de- 
light as he pulled up abreast of 
Retief with a shrill whistling of his 
borrowed jet. “Capital idea, Retief, 
these little squirt-4x)tties! You know, 
I never dreamed flying could be 
such fun! Always lived in dread 
of getting out of reach of a branch 
and just drifting aimlessly until one 
of the boys or some other predator 
got me. With these, a whole new 
dimension opens up! I can already 
detect a lessening of sibling rivalry 
drives and inverted Oedipus syn- 
dromes!” 

“Don’t let your released tensions 
go to your head, Qoj,” Retief cau- 
tioned. “The Groaci may still take 
a little managing. You hang back 
while I go in to check the lie of the 
land.” 

Minutes later, Retief swept in 



above the convoluted surface of the 
coral peak. No Groaci were to be 
seen, but half a dozen Terrans 
were wandering aimlessly about their 
lofty prison. They ran forward with 
glad cries as Retief landed. 

“Good show, my boy!” Colonel 
Smartfinger pumped his hand. “I 
knew you wouldn’t leave. us strand- 
ed here! Those rascals Groaci com- 
mandeered our harnesses.” 

“But — where are the reinforce- 
ments,” the political officer de- 
manded, staring around. “Where’s 
the lighter? Where’s His Excellency? 
Who are (hese creatures?” He eyed 
the Zooners, circling for a landing. 
“Where have you been, Retief?” He 
broke off, staring. “And where’s 
your harness?” 

“I’ll tell you later.” Retief mo- 
tioned the diplomats toward the de- 
flaited Groaci gasbag now draped 
limply across the rocks. “There’s 
no time to dally. I’m afraid. All 
aboard.” 

“But — it’s punctured!” Smart- 
finger protested. “It certainly won't 
fly, man!” 

“It will when our new allies fin- 
ish,” Retief diligently reassured the 
colonel. 

The Zooners were already busy, 
bustling about the ersatz cloud, stuff- 
ing fistfuls of seed-pods inside. A 
corner of it stirred lazily, lifted to 
flap gently in the breeze. One side 
curled upward, tugging gently. 

“You know what to do,” Retief 
called to Qoj. “Don’t waste any 
time following me down.” He jump- 
ed into the air, thumbed the jet 
control wide open, and headed for 
the next stop at flank speed.

1 '^wo thirds of the way down the 
sheer wall of the coral reef, 
a small figure caught Retief’s eye, 
perched disconsolately in a crevice 
on the rock. He swung closer, 
saw the spindly shanks and five- 
eyed visage of a Groaci, his once- 
splendid raiment in tatters. 

“Well, Field MarshaU Shish,” he 
called. “What’s the matter, condi- 
tions down below not to your lik- 
ing?” 

“Ambassador Shish, if you 
please,” the castaway hissed in sor- 
rowful Groaci. “To leave me in 
solitude, soft One; to have suffered 
enough.” 

“Not nearly enough,” Retief con- 
tradicted. “'However, all is not yet 
lost. I take it your valiant troops 
have encountered some sort of dif- 
ficulty below?” 

“The spawn of the pits fell upon 
us while I was in my bath!” the 
Groaci whispered, speaking Terran 
now. ‘They snapped up a dozen of 
my chaps before I could spring 
from the tub of hot sand in which 
I had been luxuriatingl I was for- 
tunate to escape with my life! And 
then your shoddy Terran-made har- 
ness failed and dropped me here. 
Alack! Gone are the dreams. of a 
procuratorship.” 

“Maybe not.” Retief maneuvered 
in close, held out a hand. “1^11 give 
you a piggyback and explain how 
matters stai^. Maybe you can still 
salvage something from the wreck- 
age.” 

Shish canted his eye-stalks. “Pig- 
gyback? Are you insjuie, Retief? 
\VTiy, there’s nothing h<dding you 
up! How can it hold two of us?” 



“Take it or leave it, Mr. Am- 
bassador,” Retief said. “I have a 
tight schedule.” 

“I’ll take it.” Shish gingerly swung 
his scrawny frame out and scram- 
bled to a perch on Retiefs back, 
four of his eyes sphinctered tight 
shut. “But if I hadn’t already been 
contemplating suicide, nothing 
would have coaxed me to it.” 

VII 

F ive minutes later, Retief heard 
a hail. He dropped down, settled 
onto a narrow ledge beside the slight 
figure of Ambassador Oldtrick. 

The senior diplomat had lost his 
natty beret, and there was a scratch 
on his cheek. His flight harness, 
its gas bag flat, hung on a point 
of rock behind him. 

“What’s this? Who’s captured 
whom? Retief, are you . ?” 

“Everything’s fine, your excellen- 
cy,” Retief said soothingly. “I’ll just 
leave his Groacian excellency here 
with you. I’ve had a little talk with 
him, and he has something he wants 
to tell you. The staff will be along 
in a moment, to help out.” 

“But — you can’t — ” Oldtrick 
broke off as a dark shadow flitted 
across the rock. “Duck! It’s that 
confounded cloud back again!” 

“It’s all right,” Retief called as 
he launched himself into space. “It’s 
on our side now.”

ing room aboard the heavy 
Corps transport which had been call- 
ed in to assist in the repatriation of

on Zoon after the local fauna had 
dievoured their ship supplies, 
Magnan nudged Redef. 

“Rather a surprising about-face on 
the part of Ambassador Shish,” he 
muttered. “When that fake cloud 
dumped us off on the rock ledge 
with him, I fear^ the worst.” 

“I think he'd had a spiritual ex- 
perience down below that made 
him see the light,” Relief suggested. 

“Quite an equitable division of 
spheres of influence the ambassa- 
dors agreed on,” Magnan went on. 
“The Groaci seem quite pleased 
with the idea of erecting blast-proof 
barriers to restrain those ferocious 
little eaters to one half the planet, 
and acting as herdsmen over them, 
in return for the privilege of collect- 
their hair when they moult.” 

“I wouldn’t be surprised if they 
didn’t sneak out a few pelts before- 
hand.” Colonel Smartfinger leaned 
to contribute. “Still, the Zooners 
don’t seem to mind, eh, Omx?” 
“No problem,” the Zooner said 
airly. ‘We’re glad to wink at a few 
little violations in return for free 
access to our own real estate.” 
There was a sharp dinging as 
Ambassador Oldtrick rose and tap- 
ped his glass with a fork. 

“Gentlemen — gendebeings, I 
should say.” He smirked at the 
Groaci and Zooners seated along the 
board. “It’s my pleasure to an- 
nounce the signing of the Terran- 
Zoon accord, under the terms of 
which we’ve been ceded all rights in 
the coral reef of our choice on which 
to place our chancery, well out of 
reach of those nasty little — that 
is, the untutored — I mean, er. 



playfully inclined ...” He quailed 
under the combined glares of a 
dozen rows of pink eyes. 

“If he brings those abominations 
into the conversation again, I’m 
walking out,” Qoj said loudly. 

“So we’re going to be relegated 
to the top of that dreadful sky- 
scraper?” Magnan groaned. ‘We’ll 
be communting by patent gasbag.” 
“Ah!” Oldtrick brightened, glad 
of a change of subject. “I couldn’t 
help overhearing your remark, Mag- 
nan. And I’m pleased to announce 
that I have just this afternoon de- 
veloped a startling new improve- 
ment to my flight harness. Observe!” 
All eyes were on the Ambassador 
as he rose gently into the air, hung, 
beaming from a height of six feet. 

“I should mention that I had some 
assistance from Mr. Relief in, ah, 
working out some of the techni- 
calities,” he murmured as the Ter- 
rans crowded around, competing for 
the privilege of offering their con- 
gratulations. 

“Heavens! And he’s not even 
wearing a balloon!” Magnan gasped. 
“How do you suppose he does it?“ 
“Easy,” Qoj g^ted. “He’s got 
a pocketful of price-quality Zooner 
spore-pods.” 

B eside him. Ambassador Shish 
gave an annoyed hiss. “Some- 
how, I can’t escape the conviction 
that we Groaci have been had 
again.” He rose, leaving the room. 

“Hmph,” Magnan sniffed. “He 
got what he wanted, didn’t he?” 
‘True,” Retief said, rising. “But 
it’s some people’s ill luck to always 
want the wrong thing.” END

THE FAH AWARDS 

by LIN CARTER 

All about Hugos. Speaking of which, 
guess which magazine just won one? 



E very year at the annual 
worid sdenoe^fiction conven- 
tion a half dozen liitde stainless ste^ 
model rocketships on wooden bases 
are handed out to deserving science- 
fiotion writers, ediiors, artists and 
fans. Just like television’s “Emmy” 
and the movies’ “Oscar,” this trophy 
bears an affectionate nickname — 
the “Hugo.” 

And it’s awarded for much the 
same reason: excellence, Sdence- 
fiction people, just like television 
insiders and movie folk, like to rec- 
ognize and reward a striving toward 
excellence. Oh, sure — sometimes 
you can quibble with the choice of 
winner for this or that category, 
sometimes you won’t agree with the 
majority decision of the voters, but 



I think the science-Ection world is 
more often right than wrong in their 
annual achievement awards. {Much 
more often right, for instance, than 
the fogeys who give out the Pulit- 
zer Prize for excdlence in American 
Hteraiture, and somehow manage to 
overlook authors like Thomas Wolfe, 
genius^ype poets like Ezra Pound, 
and mind-crackin*^y good novels 
like Lolita or Catch-ZZ!) 

From Laureate to Statuette 

The urge to award the outstand- 
ing has been with us in the sf world 
as long as there have been fans. 
Fandom’s major amateur publishers’ 
dub, F.A.PA., has a provision for 
annual ktureateship awards written 



77 





into its constitution. Fapans give 
fiilk-soreened award certi^ates (or 
did, kst 1 heard) for such categor- 
ies as mechanical excellence or in- 
novation in publishing techniques, 
creative editing with high standards, 
quality of writing, and so on. 

Various fanmags at various times 
have given out awards — one of 
the earliest being Fan Editor Pub- 
Usher, which has long since gone 
under — and many other mags con- 
duct annual polls of their readers’ 
choice of Fandom’s outstanding 
people of the year — best famdnc, 
best new fan, best writer, or humor- 
ist, or poet. And they used to name 
the single fan of the year whose 
achievements made him the “Num- 
ber One Fan Face.” 

Then there are the fanzines that 
give awards in the professional 
ranks, not in the fan world. Old- 
time fan Walt Daugherty was an 
early mover behind this; way back 
at the Third World Science Fiction 
Convention at Denver in 1941 he 
was passing out medals. And, today, 
the fanzine I myself edit sporadi- 
cally, between enormous and lengthy 
periods of do-nothing, has an annual 
list of the 50 best books of the 
science-fiction year and four “Spec- 
trum Awards” for best science-fic- 
tion book (novel, anthology or col- 
lection); best fantasy or weird; b^t 
children’s book and best amateur 
book or pamphlet. (To explain the 
award’s name, the magazine is an 
all-book-review thing called Spec- 
trum.) It’s currently in the dol- 
drums, but shall return. 



Then came the Hugo, and here’s 
how it happened. 

Hoi and the Hugo 

Lots of conventions passed out 
honors and awards of various kinds; 
its been happening ever since the 
1st World Science Fiction Conven- 
tion in New York City in 1939. 
Sometimes these awards are inform- 
al, sort of tokens of honor, and 
sometimes more formal and elabo- 
rate. 

For example, take The Interna- 
tional Fantasy Award. This has been 
awarded only three or four times 
and always on a very informal last- 
minute basis. In 1952 it was given 
to Clifford D. Simak for City, run- 
away all-time classic and my person- 
al favorite from Simak. George 
Stewart also won the International 
Fantasy Award for his novel Earth 
Abides. This award is granted by 
decision of a jury. Like the third 
award, for instance: nine or ten 
highly qualified judges were polled; 
among them was Donald A. Woll- 
heim, editor-in-chief of Ace Books. 
They gave the International Fan- 
tasy Award to Professor J.R.R. 
Tolkien for his world-famous fan- 
tasy trilogy. The Lord of the Rings. 
Hardly anyone would quibble with 
that choice, but, still, the jury-award 
system does lack personal participa- 
tion, while the Hugo is given on the 
basis of ballot-box voting by World- 
con attendees. 

The idea of the Hugo first arose 
in the mind of a Philadelphia fan 



78 



IF 




named Hal Lynch, who has since 
moved to New York. The year was 
1953, and it was a couple of months 
before the Labor Day weekend 
when the 11th Convention was to 
be held in Philadelphia. Hal got his 
bright idea by analogy with Holly- 
wood’s annual Oscar orgy and pass- 
ed it on to the convention com- 
mittee. 

After some fumbling around — 
all conventions are put on by a 
small number of ferociously busy, 
terrifically overworked people who 
never get enough help and rarely 
get any sleep either before or dur- 
ing their convention — after some 
initial difficulties, I say, a chap 
named Jack McKnight of Lansdale, 
Pennsylvania got the job done. He 
designed and hand-crafted the first 
Hugos: little rocketships of stain- 
less steel, adorned with fins at tail 
and midsection, standing on round 
wooden bases fitted out with in- 
scribed plates. 

These were passed out, nine of 
’em, to great excitement and enthu- 
siasm. Alfred Bester won the novel 
award for The Demolished Man, 
easily one of the very finest science- 
fiction novels of 1953, or any other 
year, for that matter. Willy Ley got 
one for non-fiction science writing, 
Forrest J. Ackerman for fan activi- 
ties, and Philip Jose Farmer, as 
most outstanding new science-fiction 
writer of the year. There were 
awards given in seven categories, 
but actually nine Hugos were given 
out, because of ties. Hannes 
one of the greatest fantasy artists 



of all time, tied with Ed Emshwiller 
as best cover artist, and Galaxy and 
Astounding tied as best professional 
magazine of the year. The ninth and 
last of the little steel spaceships went 
to Virgil Finlay as best interior illus- 
trator. 

And that was it. Nobody really 
thought of making the Hugo an 
every-year thing; in fact, at the 
next year’s convention (the 12th 
World Science Fiction Convention 
at San Francisco in 1954) there 
were no awards of any kind. Nor 
were these first Hugos called Hugos; 
officially, they were “The Science 
Fiction Achievement Awards.” 

Before I get into how, where and 
when the Hugos were revived, let’s 
answer the question no doubt vib- 
rating in many of your little minds 
— to wit: 

Who was ''Hugo''? 

In 1904 a young man of 20 named 
Hugo Gernsback came to this coun- 
try from Luxembourg, which is one 
of those little vestpocket-^ized Euro- 
pean countries. Radio was a bur- 
geoning young giant in those dim, 
far-off days of 62 years ago, and the 
new field of electronics was just get- 
ting started. Mr. Gernsback was fas- 
cinated by the potentials of these 
brave new worlds and, somehow or 
other, drifted into magazine publish- 
ing. He printed things called The 
Electrical Experimenter and Modern 
Electrics, He published the first ra- 
dio catalogue in history and the first 
book on radio, says sf historian Sam 



THE FAN AWARDS

Moskowitz. He took out patents, ran 
a “liain” radio station, and did a lot 
of otiher tinngs, one of them being 
the invention of science fiction it- 
self as a viable magazine classifica- 
tion. 

It seems the slow, creeping pace 
of real-life scientific experiment was 
too darn slow for the young man 
from Luxembourg. UnaWe to keep 
his lively imagination chained to the 
advance of modern science, he be- 
gan interspersing some hard-headed 
futuristic predictions (both as fact 
articles and as fiction) in amongst 
the pages of his publications. Even- 
tually came an all-fiction issue of 
his magazine Science and Invention 
in August 1923. And the success of 
that experiment led him to found 
the first science-fiction magazine in 
the world. 

Not only did he found the world’s 
first science-fiction magazine, but he 
actually coined the phrase “science 
ifiction” itself, thus giving our field a 
name and adding a new term to the 
English language. He has also writ- 
ten some science fiction, such as the 
famous novel Ralph 124C41-|- (this 
futuristic numerical last name is a 
joke — read it like this: “Ralph, 
one to foresee for one plusr). This 
novel may not be too distinguished 
as a piece of fiction, but it has 
earned him several accolades from 
the scientific world. In it he hit 
what must have been an all-time 
high for successful predicting. He 
accurately foresaw and described 
“fluorescent lighting, skywriting, 
automatic packaging madhines, plas- 



tics, the radio directional range find- 
er, juke boxes’* — them we could 
have happily done without! — not 
to mention “Squid fertilizer, hydro- 
ponics, tape recorders, rustproof 
steel, loud speakers, night baseball, 
aquacades, microfilm, television, ra- 
dio networks, vending machines dis- 
pensing hot and cold foods, flying 
saucers, a device for teaching while 
the user is asleep, solar energy for 
heat and power, fabrics from glass, 
synthetic materials such as nylon 
for wearing apparel, and, of course, 
space travel.” (The list was admir- 
ingly compiled by Sam Moskowitz.) 
And, last but not least, radar — 
which he not only described most 
accurately but actually diagrammed! 

Well, what with all this, Gerns- 
back — still alive and going strong 
— came to be known as “The Fa- 
ther of Science Fiction.” And, just 
naturally, what with “Emmy” and 
“Oscar and the Mystery Writers of 
America’s “Edgar” — they had to 
name the little steel rocketships 
“Hugo” in affectionate honor of the 
pioneer who started the whole thing 
and blazed several trails we are still 
following (such as space sickness; 
Gernsback accurately described the 
vertigo-cum-nausea of freefall in his 
Ralph 124C41-f, but we had to 
wait until modem science caught 
up with him, as it did in the 1950’s 
when the Air Force space laboratory 
experiments simulated free fall con- 
ditions and found the same sort of 
physiological symptoms that Gems- 
back described back in 1911. How’s 
that for predicting?)

The 

IRON THORN 

by ALOIS BUDRYS 

Illustrated by MORROW 

He had given himself over fo Man's 
age-old enemies, the monsters that 
were called Amsirs — and now he had 
fo pay for his treason with his life! 



What Has Gone Before 

n the Beginning was the Thorn. 
The world is flat and circular; 
a sunken desert, cold, wanly lit, 
nearly airless. The Thorn is high, 
blunt, nearly featureless; a metal 



tower at the center of the world, 
and only around it are things any 
different. The farms have been 
around the Thorn since time be- 
gan, inside the perimeter of air and 
warmth somehow clinging to the 
Thorn. Beyond that perimeter there 



82 






is no water, warmth or breath. Men 
and women are born farmers, have 
children and die. When they die, 
they go to Ariwol where there* s 
happiness for everyone, and feast 
goes on forever. 

Out in the desert live animals 
called Amsirs — man-sized, flight- 
less, bat-winged, predatory, un- 
breathing. Killed and brought back 
to the Thorn, these are the source 
of that rare delicacy, meat. Their 
bones provide the darts and throw- 
ing sticks with which they are killed, 
and their hard, bulbous skins, suit- 
ably trimmed out, provide the **bub- 
blesf* in which drinking water is car- 
ried out into the desert by the aris- 
tocratic Honors, whose only occu- 
pation in life is honning Amsirs. 

Boy children of the Thorn vie 
with each other and attempt to make 
it through the rigorous training rit- 
ual, so that they may grow up to 
be Honors. Most drop out and turn 
Farmer. Only a few get through the 
ritual far enough to be issued one 
of the metal caps that somehow 
provide a man with air and insula- 
tion beyond the perimeter of the 
farmland. 

Once he has killed his first Am- 
sir and brought it back to the Thorn, 
a Honor has few worries. He lives 
inside the Thorn and is maintained 
by the community. Any piece of 
farmer property, such as food and 
women, is his on demand. The only 
drawback to this life of ease is the 
need to periodically go out and kill 
additional Amsirs, who are objects 
of terror but not much information 
in the Farmer community. 

In one brief day, novice Honor 



Jackson finds out how much of the 
foregoing is either an outright lie 
or a distortion of the truth. The 
Amsir he finally does kill only tries 
to make him surrender, calling to 
him ' in perfectly understandable 
speech, and carries but doesn*t use 
a metal spear which is a weapon^ 
far superior to anything known by 
the people of the Thorn. 

The facts that the Amsirs are 
intelligent, hostile but not vicious, 
and have a clear but unknown ag- 
gressive purpose directed toward the 
people of the Thorn, are Honor 
trade secrets, Jackson learns when 
he gets back to the Thorn. His own 
elder brother, armed and waiting 
in ambush, first makes sure that 
Jackson bears no telltale spear 
wounds and is sufficiently proud 
of having made his kill not to spill 
his discovery to the farmers. The 
Eld Honor also checks him out, and 
though Jackson is clearly bitter, the 
Eld decides ifs only the same bit- 
terness thafs always made him a 
loner and represents no present 
danger to the Honor system. In 
fact, the Eld professes admiration 
for Jackson*s long-standing traits of 
character and intelligence, considers 
him of the elite among Honors and 
treats him as one of his intellectual 
and spiritual heirs. This legacy is 
to be collected only provided he 
keeps his nose clean. There are 
other inducements to conformity 
besides this one; after all, every 
Honor who survived his novice honn 
has a vested interest in making sure 
no one upsets the structure of the 
society. 

Jackson feels he owes it to him- 



THE IRON THORN 



83 




sdf to be nobody* s fool. He slips 
back out into the desert^ is am- 
bushed by but kills Red FUson, who 
is the Ehi*s chief enforcer and who, 
incidentally and quite legitimately, 
long ago killed Jackson's father be- 
cause he wanted Jackson's mother, 
(Some of Jackson* s early cynicism 
may stem from the fact that his 
father was a Honor just like Filson, 
as well as from the fact that his 
elder brother is such a square). 

Having done all that, Jackson 
immediately surrenders to an Amsir, 
who provides him with Amsir-manu- 
factured bottles of air and water, 
and robes to keep him warm — all 
made of human skin — and marches 
off, out to the towering rim of the 
world, up the rim, and onto the 
crest. There Jackson sees another 
world spread out before him. 

Equally circular, sunken, and flat, 
equally dominated by a Thorn, this 
one is choked from rim to rim with 
air, with fields, colorful fairytale 
houses, and the winged Amsirs soar- 
ing with joy, gambolling in the light 
of early morning. 

^‘Ariwolr Jackson laughs, sore, 
wounded, exhausted, but not pious.

will have to climb down,” 
® die Amsir said, showing 
JacksOB a place on the rim where 
you could see something that looked 
like a path. “You can leave those 
things here.” The Amsir nodded his 
head toward the robes Jackson was 
cairyhig over his good arm. “They 
will be taken.” 



Jackson dropped the stuff on the 
ground. When the Amsir ne^igendy 
knocked his spear point against the 
iron cap, Jackson took that off too 
and set it down on top of the pile. 
All he had left now was the dart, 
still trapped in the joint of his left 
dbow, and the human-leather tourni- 
quet. He shrugged and began to 
scramble down. It was six or eight 
times his own height to the ground. 
The Amsir did something that must 
have given him a lot of pleasure. He 
stepped off a steep place in the rim, 
cupped his wings, and pivoted lux- 
uriantly so as to be able to keep 
watching Jackson while he drifted 
downward. Every so often he beat 
his wings once or twice gracefully 
and kept himself froln sinking down 
too quickly. 

For Jackson, clambering down 
wasn’t any picnic. He had to do it 
all one-handed, which meant that 
often enough he had to brace him- 
self by leaning his face or his 
chest into the broken rock and 
grit so as to keep his feet from 
sliding. It was just too damn bad, 
wasn’t it, he thought. 

He began running into patches of 
the pretty blue-green stuff that he 
had seen filling the bottom of this 
world so attractively right up to 
the rim. It was cheesy and brittle; 
it broke off and smeared under his 
hand and against his body when 
he rubbed against rocks it was grow- 
ing on. It smeUed sharp in the way 
old bread dough tasted, and it came 
apart in little leafy chips. Jackson 
had never seen anything like it be- 
fore, but while it looked fine from 
up there on the rim, down here with 



84 



IF 




it, it looked a little bit like some- 
t^ng that had made somebody sick. 

He got down to the Amsir world 
with a half-twist of his body that 
left him leaning against the rocks 
at the bottom of the rim. From 
down here it was only a ^ntle slope 
for maybe a dozen dozen strides, 
and then everything flattened out. 
Already, from this angle, most of 
his view of the Amsir Thom was 
blocked by the Amsir houses stilting 
their way into the air. It all looked 
a little different — not as spread 
out, and pretty crowded. 

His left forearm and hand were 
turning purplish white. The Amsir 
came down lightly a few strides 
away from him as he stopped to 
loosen the tie above his elbow and 
leaned watching the blood squirt out 
around the dart. He tried to work 
his hand, and finally he reached 
over with his right hand, pushing 
against the crooked stiffness in his 
fingers. A little bit of that and 
he was able to make his thumb and 
forefinger twitch toward each other. 
They were also beginning to feel 
like he was holding them in a fire. 
Profit and loss. He tied the leather 
band tightly again. 

The Amsir said: “Do you have 
any idea of how long that will 
need to heal?” 

‘T don’t know. Long time, I guess. 
Tell yoii better after somebody helps 
me get this dart out.” 

“We have individuals who can do 
that, but I don’t mean how long un- 
til it is perfect; in your expenence, 
how long until it can do work?” 

“Look, I don’t* know. Six, nine 
days. Maybe twelve. Maybe three.” 



“Three ....’* the Amsir re- 
peated to himself thoughtfully. He 
looked Jackson up and down. “No 
sooner?” 

“Look, I told you — ” Jackson 
stopped and let it go. Peo{^ never 
believed anything they hadn’t 
touched, and the Amsir didn’t have 
any dart in his elbow. The Amsir 
was just fine standing there with 
his lace drifting perkily around him, 
in the breeze that swept toward the 
rim along the floor of the world 
and vanished up the rocks. Jackson 
knew there was something different 
about his face, and then he saw 
that there were two wrinkle-edged 
holes open where a man’s nostrils 
would be if his upper lip was an 
Amsir beak. And he could hear air 
hissing in and out of them. The 
Amsir was upwind of him too, and, 
now that he noticed, Jackson could 
smell the old breath empt)dng itself 
out of his chest bubbles. 

“Come along,” the Amsir said, 
motioning with his spear. ‘*We don’t 
have time to waste. You have to 
walk to the tower.” He pointed with 
one wingtip. By that, Jackson could 
tell he meant the Thom. “You’ll 
have to just walk through the fields,” 
the Amsir said as he sprang up 
into the air to circle watchfully 
around Jackson. “We don’t make 
paths.” 

T hey stopped once on tl^ir way 
toward the Amsir Thom, at 
the nearest of the stilt-legged houses. 
The house was made of something 
tough like horn but scratched up 
and very old, looking as if it had 
once held' a lot more particles of 



THE IRON THORN 



85 




its bright yellow color. The Amsir 
sprang higher into the air and dung 
to one of the uprights with his claws 
and one hand. He reached up over 
his head to tug on the downswinging 
loop of the line that connected this 
house to the next one. Jackson could 
hear a bell clang inside. Clang, long 
pause, clang clang, short pause, then 
more clangs and spaced-out pauses. 

It got mixed up in Jackson’s ears 
because as soon as the line had 
transmitted the Amsir’s pulling-up 
to the next house, he could hear 
another bell in there echoing the 
sound. Then he could hear it again 
faintly from the house beyond that, 
and then very faintly off in the 
distance, always moving in the di- 
rection of the Thorn. The Amsir 
stopped pulling and waited. After 
a little while Jackson could hear 
a sound coming back along the 
ropes from the direction of the 
Thom. It was a short answer, what- 
ever it was. The Amsir nodded in 
satisfaction and waved Jackson on 
with his spear. 

“All right, hurry up now,” he 
cried down. “They are waiting for 
you.” 

They were getting notice from 
other Amsirs now, too. Some of 
them popped out the doorways of 
the houses, jumping into the air and 
swooping to get a look^at Jackson. 
Others — women and young kids, 
or anyhow acting the way women 
and young kids would have acted 
if they’d been Farmers — clung 
to the edges of doorways. 

They began to make something 
of a procession, Jackson and all the 
Amsirs fluttering and swooping 



overhead. The Amsirs in the air 
called to each other and back to 
their families in the houses. And the 
families called back to them. It 
began to make a hell of a racket 
overhead, shadows and air-gusts 
down on the ground. Jackson thought 
of baffling them a little by walking 
under the houses instead of around 
them, but there was too much ma- 
nure on the ground there, and he 
didn’t try it twice. 

XII 

441V iTy name’s Honor Red Jack- 

IVJL son,” he said to the old Am- 
sir he’d found crouching in a room 
of their Thorn. Crouching wasn’t 
right — this Amsir was more like 
leaning bent-legged with some of 
his weight on his wingtips. 

“They have a complex system of 
naming,” said another old, skinnier 
Amsir who’d been called in by the 
first one, who Jackson guessed was 
their Eld. There were quite a few 
Amsirs in the room, counting the 
young one who’d brought him in, 
and the doctor-like one who was 
studying his elbow. The doctor-like 
one was studying his elbow in part 
by twisting the set of naked human 
arm bones he’d brought in with 
him. Jackson hoped he’d soon fig- 
ure out just how he was going to 
tinker this thing up, and get around 
to doing his job. 

“‘Honor’ is his community stat- 
us,” the skinny one was still ex- 
plaining. “It signifies that he lives 
exclusively by hunting our sort of 
creature. ‘Red’ means that in addi- 
tion to having met the hunting re- 



86 



IF 




quirement, he had also performed the 
optional office of IkilliDig a creaiture 
of his own 'kind. Jackson simply 
means that he is the son of an older 
creature of his own kind named 
Jack. For creatures in sparse cir- 
cumstances they have a most amaz- 
ing complex of rituals. I can’t imag- 
ine how they distinguish between 
brothers of identical status — I do 
not say they don’t so distinguish. 
I’m sure they do.” 

The Amsir Eld grunted at the 
skinny one. “Do not, I pray, give 
me any more labels for him. They 
may have to distinguish, but we 
don’t have so many of them, ever, 
that we must. Tell me what he is, 
not what he stands for.” 

“I am telling you. It’s significant 
that he should be so obviously 
young; that he should carry the very 
fresh scars of combat with one of 
our own kind — which means he 
brought one of our own kind to the 
last extremity — and then the even 
more recent scars of combat with 
one of his own kind. This was a 
odd one even before he did the odd- 
est thing of all and yielded volun- 
tarily.” The skinny Amsir looked 
as Jackson proudly, as if he’d pro- 
duced him himself. 

“The odder the better,” the Eld 
Amsir snapped. “We’ve had no luck 
with the usual run.” 

“Precisely my point,” the instruct- 
ing Amsir said. 

“Then why didn’t you make it 
to begin with?” 

“Pfah! I didi” 

“Only in hindsight. Get out.” The 
Eld Amsir jerked his head toward 
the doorway, and the instructor 



shuffled out reluctantly. The Eld 
Amsir turned all his attention to- 
ward Jackson’s end of the room. 
“You, Doctor — get on with it.” 
He came a few steps closer, and 
Jackson noticed something. He 
wasn’t old. At least — now that he 
was in some kind of better light 
coming in through the narrow Thorn 
window-slits — the tattering of his 
lace, and the crumpled look of the 
wing Jackson could see best, were 
accounted for by damage. He was 
pretty badly scarred up, and dis- 
colored. He looked as if he’d been 
picked up and knocked hard against 
something rough, and had left big 
patches of his hide against that 
rough thing, and had had a lot of 
bones broken for it. But he threw 
his weight around like an Eld, and 
that bothered Jackson. He idn’t 
like the idea of somebody being 
mean enough inside to be an Eld, 
but still not slowed down in his 
head very much. 

JacksonI I am above all 
I others here. No one of my 
kind of creature will tell you we 
have any time, so give me straight, 
fast answers. I am told you were 
ready to yield when that young one 
by the doorway found you. This is 
something new. Explain it.” 

The doctor put one hand on Jack- 
son’s biceps, the other on his fore- 
arm and closed his beak on the lace- 
feathered end of the dart in Jack- 
son’s elbow. His claws made little 
purchase-hunting sounds on the 
cement flooring. 

Jackson figured it would 'be best 
to pay him no heed. “Didn’t like 



THE IRON THORN

it where I was,” he said to the Eld. 
“Figured Fd go to where the lies 
were all about. Make up my own 
if I had to.” 

“Pfu. Lies require life. You won’t 
live.” 

“Right up to the minute I die, 
I will. Oh, hell!” he hcrflered as the 
doctor jerked his head back while 
twisting his aim. The dart sucked 
out of Jackson’s wound and hung for 
an instant in the doctor’s beak until 
it was dropped. The doctor’s hand 
closed as best it could above Jack- 
son’s elbow — the fingers couldn’t 
make it all the way around the 
flesh. Jadeson reached over to help 
him, eyes swfanming. 

“i think perh 2 q>s you thought you 
coidd hunt us as you think we hunt 
you,** the Eld said shrewdly. “I 
think perhaps you thought out that 



there was another world in which 
our sort of creature was prey. 1 
think you thought you knew a way 
to get breathing stuff. You are young 
enough to have thought that because 
you were a little bit odd, and you 
frightened your own kind, you 
would frighten us too.” 

Jackson just kept gripping hts 
arm, swaying with his eyes dosed. 
He did have room enough inside 
himself, though, to think how won- 
derful it was that everybody, an 
Amsir included, could think he knew 
everything just because he knew 
something. 

“Well, that’s not how it is, crea- 
ture,” the Eld Amsir went right on, 
while the doctor unstoppered a stone 
bottle of something that lodced like 
water but burned like fire when 
he poured it over Jackson’s running 



88 



IF 



elbow, and then began winding a 
long, tight strip of shaved-thin hide 
around Jackson’s left arm in a spiral 
from shoulder to wrist. “In some 
ways here, for you it is the way it 
is for our kind of creature with 
you. We cannot breathe the breath- 
ing stuff around your fields. Muck 
from that stuff you grow is in 
every breathful. We die — you 
would say prettily — with our first 
breath of it; our muscles knot so 
hard our bones break, our back- 
bones snap; green fur fills our lungs. 
Or so the instructors say, from the 
times long ago when we still tried. 

“Haw! We die of breathing the 
air that blows across the stuff you 
eat. This is the stuff we eat.” He 
pointed a wing at a heap of the 
blue, crumbly stuff from the fields. 
“That is rock-stuff. That is the food 



for creatures of wing and spirit. 
Can you eat rock? No others of 
your kind have been able to. You 
will die, prettily. Your stomach 
will sink in, your bones wiM show 
through the meat on you; toward the 
end, you will try to fang us and 
we will kick you away. You will bite 
yourself. You will try to get away 
back to your poison Thorn, and we 
will kick you back to work. You 
will live ^together perhaps thirty 
days, perhaps less. Only perhaps 
perhaps will you live any longer than 
that. And only perhaps perhaps per- 
haps will you ever be happy again 
before you die. It depends how 
quickly and how well you can do 
things; on how odd you are, and 
most of all on whether you are 
luckier than any other creature of 
your own kind that we have ever

kad here. Now — ” he jerked his 
head toward’s Jacksoa’s bound-up 
aim. “How soon do you think you 
wiB be able to do work with that?” 

J ackson raised his arm experi- 
mentally. It throbbed when he 
did that; it felt like something made 
out of one solid stick of bone. 
“Thanks, Doc,” he said to the doc- 
tor, who was standing off to one 
side watching him critically. Jack- 
son tried to move his hand. It 
wouldn’t work. He began knocking 
it against his thigh, trying to get 
some circulation into his fingers. 
“What kind of work?” he said 
to the Eld Amsir. 

“rU show you.” The Eld gestured 
toward the doorway. “Turn toward 
your right after you leave the room.” 
Jackson did that. The Eld Amsir 
and the young one who’d brought 
him in followed him. The doctor 
tried to go with him too, but the 
Eld just looked back over his shoul- 
der and said, “Not you.” The doc- 
tor turned around, quickly, and 
rustled toward the daylight Jackson 
had come in from. 

The way Jackson had been told 
to turn led him deeper into the 
Amsir Thorn. It was a narrow pas- 
sageway, and at widely spaced dis- 
tances there were lights glowing be- 
hind translucent panels in the metal 
ceiling overhead. It was like walk- 
ing through something’s ribs. Every 
so often they’d come to another 
oval ridge that ran completely 
around, up the walls and across the 
ceiling. There was always an open 
door folded neatly back against the 
wall. Halfway between any two of 



these doors, there’d be another one 
like it, but set directly into the 
wall at Jackson’s left side. These 
were closed; sometimes there was 
light behind them, coming through 
a little bull’s-eye window, and some- 
times there wasn’t. Sometimes there 
were particular sounds of machines 
going; sometimes there was just 
the general sound of the Thorn, 
which was louder and healthier than 
the sounds of Jackson’s Thorn. But 
not one of these doors leading to 
the inside told him anything, ex- 
cept what he already knew, that 
this Thorn was tougher than his own. 

The passageway curved this way 
and that; sometimes it turned sharp- 
ly. From the sound growing louder 
and louder, and then beginning to 
taper off behind him at more or 
less the same rate, Jackson guessed 
it was some kind of path they’d set 
up for getting through the Thorn to 
the other side without having to go 
around it. Three times, they came 
to ladders taking up half the pas- 
sageway’s space and going up to 
round doors set in the ceiling. Two 
of them were closed, and the metal 
rungs of the ladders were dull and 
softly smooth. At the top of the 
third ladder was a round black 
opening, and the ladder was scratch- 
ed up. There were bright, polished 
places on the wall, going up be- 
side the ladder, where Amsir wings 
had dragged against it a lot of times. 
He tried to imagine an Amsir work- 
ing his way up one of these lad- 
ders, just as he could see how they 
had to inch and shuffle to get 
around the ladders and keep go- 
ing down the passageway. It wasn’t 



90 



IF 




handy for them, this place. Well, 
it wasn’t handy for him either, but 
it was what they had. 

T hey Came to another room that 
opened on the outside. It had 
a couple more Amsirs in it, in- 
cluding the instructor one who’d 
been nagging the Eld about him 
in the Eld’s room. 

“Are you going to show it to him 
now?” this one asked the Eld. 

“He won’t get any stronger.” 
“No — or at least, none of them 
have. But you know, they do have 
this ability to store energy. Amaz- 
ing, really, when you think of it. At 
least, we’ve never observed any of 
them carrying nourishment out into 
the desert with them, and we know 
they’ve certainly been able to func- 
tion unfed for significant periods of 
time here. Whereas we’re hard put 
to it to find individuals with the 
endurance to omit feeding for as 
much as a day — ” 

“ — What the learned one who is 
well above me refers to,” broke in 
the young Amsir who’d been hang- 
ing around the instructor, “is the 
surmise that perhaps these creatures 
are trading time for energy. They 
may be ^oing into some sort of 
survival mode which permits a 
stretch-out of energy consumption 
by maintaining a low level of physi- 
cal and mental activity. As you 
know from the learned one’s wit- 
nessed discourses, he would very 
much like to attempt stimulating one 
of these creatures, as for example 
with pain, on the supposition that 
this may force it to re-enter a more 
energetic mode, of shorter dura- 



tion, perhaps, but much more pro- 
ductive of over-all results . ” 
Nobody list^ed with interest. Not 
even the instructor Amsir, who was 
doing his best not to pay attention, 
or at least look as if he were some- 
place else entirely. He looked at 
the walls, the floor and the ceiling 
while the novice instructor’s voice 
got lower and lower. Jackson didn’t 
want to hear about pain, whatever 
a mode was. The young Amsir who’d 
brought him in was looking at the 
instructor novice the way a Honor 
would look at a Farmer his own 
age, except he wasn’t measuring him 
for the kill. Finally, the Eld Amsir 
said, “Shut up,” gently, and the 
novice instructor did. Ivooking at 
Jackson, the Eld Amsir asked: “Do 
the young practice as much, where 
you come from?” 

“Only honning. The farming takes 
care of itself. The Thorn spreads the 
water in the fields, and the plows 
run no matter what you try to do.” 
“Well, we are better than you,” 
the Eld said matter-of-factiy. “Both 
of you shut up,” he added toward 
the instructor, who’d begun to open 
his beak. “This one’s enough experi- 
ment for me just the way he is.” He 
nudged Jackson toward the door 
with the tip of one wing. “Step out 
and look at that,” he said. 

Jackson found himself looking 
from the doorway at something a 
lot like a small Thorn. It tapered up 
into the air, maybe a dozen times 
as high as a man. But it was spikier, 
and it had other spikes curving down 
— it rested on three of them. It had 
openings, too, like throats yawning 
down toward the ground. It was 



THE IRON THORN 



91 




made of the same kind of metal as 
the Thorn; in that shape, though, 
spikey and open-mouthed, it looked 
mean and twisty. 

“W^hat is that?” Jackson asked. 
“It’s the Thorn Thing. It’s been 
here since the beginning of the 
World. You see that?” The Hd 
pointed up the side of the thing. 
There was a ladder coming down to 
within say three feet of the ground. 
Jackson squinted; up at the head 
of the ladder was something that 
looked like another one of the closed 
doorways, but had no familiar cir- 
cular handle to turn. It was just 
an oval crack in the metal. Turning 
his head, and shifting his feet back 
and forth, Jackson could see glints 
from scratches up there; shallow 
ones, no more than futile scrapes. 

44/^T^hat’s a doorway, isn’t it?” 
A the Eld Amsir said. 

“Looks like one,” Jackson agreed. 
“Don’t you know?” 

“It says it’s a doorway. It has 
a voice, and the instructor tells me 
that’s what it says.” The Eld cast 
a glance at the instructor. “There 
isn’t anyone who will tell me it 
says something else.” 

“I’ve spent a long time deciding 
that’s what it says,” the instructing 
Amsir said vehemently. “I have giv- 
en witnessed discourses — ” 

“Shut up,” the Eld Amsir said. 
Jackson looked the Thom Thing 
up and down again. There wasn’t 
anything now left to notice, except 
maybe for the burnt, black splash on 
the ground right under it, that the 
spikey legs rested in. That looked 
a little wrong — as if somebody 



had been building fires under it not 
too long ago; not as long ago as 
the beginning of time. Otherwise, 
it just sat there. He certainly didn’t 
hear any voice saying, “I’m a door.” 

“What do you want me to do with 
this thing?” 

“Climb the ladder and op^ the 
door,” the Eld Amsir said. 

“Just that?” 

“P/w/ Almost every one of our 
kind of creature who’s tried it has 
been killed. Some of us have only 
been hurt very much and made very 
angry. Every one of your kind of 
creature who’s tried it has starved 
to death.” 

xm 

O h, haw, Jackson thought, feel- 
ing weak and disgusted. He 
looked up toward the door in the 
Thorn Thing again and then at the 
ladder. It seemed to him that a 
bone^eary, one-armed, light-headed, 
sleepless, foodless, hopeless mai! 
could get up it all right. Considering 
eveiything. He looked at the door 
again. But the damn thing didn’t 
have any handle. Well. He got him- 
self moving and sauntered toward 
the ladder. 

Standing there right under the 
Thom Thing he could see two things; 
one, that it was pretty big, the other 
that it had been there long enough 
for the three spikes it rested on to 
have become very nearly a part of 
the soil. It didn’t look as if it 
had been set down on the ground, 
and the ground didn’t look as if it 
had been piled around it. It had die 
look that walls of huts at the home

IF 




I horn had — or that the Thorn it- 
self had, come to that — of having 
poked up from underneath, and of 
the ground bulging just a little bit at 
the torn edges, as if maybe a dozen 
dozen years from now it would fin- 
ish reacting to this growth and would 
finally lie flat. 

He put his good aim on the lad- 
der two or three rungs up and gave 
a little tug followed by a harder 
one. There was no give in it. He 
could see that it came out of the side 
of the Thorn Thing just below the 
doorway. And he could see a sort 
of hinge at each rung, as if the 
ladder were made to fold and be 
pulled up inside a small space some- 
where up there. Or could be kicked 
out and let hang this way when 
needed. But if those were hinges 
they had no give in them. He put his 
ear to the ladder, which was as 
warm as his own flesh, and he could 
hear things humming. Well, any- 
thing that could talk had to have 
a heart. 

He looked over at the bunch of 
Amsirs. All of them were watching 
him with considerable interest. 
There were other Amsirs gathering 
overhead — passers-by and just 
loungers who’d noticed that a new 
creature of his kind was about to 
try for the talking door. 

One of them swooped down and 
came no more than his own height 
over Jackson’s head. “Haa, damp 
thing! Oimb! Climb!” He hov«*ed 
up at the level of the door and 
made scrabbling, fake-desperate 
grabs toward it for as long as he 
could hold his attitude, then fell 
away, got his wings straightened 



back around the way he wanted 
them, and buffeted up Into the air 
again. Jackson noticed that it woidd 
have been a much better piece of 
mockery if the Amsir had dared to 
have actually touched the door. 

Jackson took a little jump into the 
air, grabbed the ladder, got one foot 
up and began to climb. 

I t was peculiar, the way the metal 
felt neither cold nor hot. Al- 
though he had to do all the work 
with one arm and his legs, it was 
nothing like when he’d had to slip 
and slide down the rim into this 
place. He felt pretty good, as a 
matter of fact. There were worse 
things a man could do with, his time 
than climb this ladder. He wished 
he knew what the Thorn Thing was, 
that made a man feel this good. 

Pretty soon he was up high 
enough to look down at the Amsirs 
on the ground. They were all watch- 
ing him, their faces turning up 
gridiwork-like to follow his dimb 
as if each of their bodies were a 
Thorn and he was the sun. 

Up to now, the ladder had beeo 
hanging reasonably far away from 
the side of the Thom Thing. But 
the hi^er he got, the closer the 
bulges of the Thorn Thing got to the 
straight-hanging ladder. Now his 
eyes were only inches away ftom 
the side of the thing itsdf, and he 
could see something that didn’t dieer 
him up, which were grease-smears 
shimmering in the light, from all the 
hands that had mbbed here before 
him as he stopped to lean his weight 
on the comfortable, neith^ warm 
nor cold humming metal. 



THE IRON THORN

Oh, pfu, he said to himself and 
kept climbing, until finally he was 
at the top of the ladder. Here there 
was a little open door, not too thick, 
but not too thin, and strongly hinged, 
positioned under the slit so as to 
protect it against anything being 
thrown up from below. When the 
ladder was pulled up, probably the 
little door closed behind it and left 
no more seam than the door above 
it did. When his eyes came level 
with it, he noticed that there was a 
broken-off, fleshless fingerbone 
trapped in the crack between the 
little open door and the main side 
of the Thorn Thing, and at the' same 
time a voice over his head growl- 
ed hollowly: “Ouwwtenshowmnnn. 
Dhayss dwuuhrr uhhpnnss owwnn- 
uhhli t umm-nn pehrrsowwnnuhhll. 
Awwll ouwwthrr uhluff-ffouwrrms 



wuull be dhaysstroydd wieyethouyut 
dhaysscriyeshunn.” 

Jackson looked up at the door. 
Nothing was happening. The door 
began to say again: “Ouwwten- 

shownnn. Dhayss dwuuhrr . .” 

Jackson climbed back down the 
ladder. 

“Shakes you, doesn’t it?” said the 
Eld Amsir, at the foot of the lad- 
der. 

“It sounds like somebody’s stom- 
ach,” Jackson said. He looked over 
at the instructor Amsir. "'What did 
he say it says?” The Eld followed his 
glance and raised a wingtip. The 
instructing Amsir came forward, 
brimming over and ready to spill. 

“Do not be misled by the growling, 
rumbling sounds. I have said them 
to myself at any number of speeds 
and pitches of voice, and I have 




had many below me say them to 
me in various modes according to 
my instructions. I have had witness- 
es in great number judge the various 
effects and reach agreement among 
themselves as to the meaning of 
this sort of speech. It is the con- 
sensus,” he said with proud con- 
clusiveness, “that what the door is 
giving is first a sound much like our 
word ‘display alertness.’ This is fol- 
lowed by a sound which is very 
definitely the word ‘this’. Then there 
is a sound very much like our word 
for ‘hatch’ — ” 

“Shut up,” Jackson said to the 
shock of some and the amusement of 
the Eld. “You mean that’s just a 
funny way of talking straight.” 

T he instructing Amsir looked at 
Jackson almost tearfully, as if 



it were a farmer whose daughter had 
just gone off laughing with a Honor. 
“That’s right.” 

“I want to get this dear. It 
talks like we do but it has a funny 
mouth, is that it?” 

“That seems to be the case,” the 
Eld Amsir said. 

“Well, now look,” Jackson said. 
“That’s a big thing. There’s your 
kind of creature and my kind of 
creature, and now all of a sudden 
there’s a third kind. And if it’s all 
connected up with things that have 
been here since the beginning of 
time, then that thing talks for what- 
ever made time begin.” 

“Listen, you stinking, infidel, 
damp thing, you keep your mouth 
off theology!” 

The young Amsir who’d brought 
him in had been hanging around all 




THE IRON THORN 



95 



this time without saying two words 
or even boo. It made Jackson twang 
a little inside for having him come 
on this strong all of a sudden. But 
he rolled his eyes over at the young- 
ster with enough cool to make it 
stick. “Now what are you talking 
about?” 

“Don’t pick at it,” the Eld Amsir 
said to the young warrior with what 
had to be the fond substitute for 
‘shut up!’ “It’s just an ignorant crea- 
ture. Listen, I think things are pret- 
ty well controlled here — you can 
go home and tell your flock you are 
well above many for this day’s 
work. Go home. Now.” 

The young Amsir jumped for the 
air. “I am rewarded,” he said thank- 
fully to the Eld, before he flung him- 
self straight up like a thrown dart 
aimed at the sun, shouting at the 
top of his lungs, “I am above many! 
I am above many!” High, high up, 
he flung himself out flat and went 
tearing down at a shallow angle for 
a particular one of the stilt-legged 
houses, still shouting. Jackson could 
hear his voice shrinking. 

The Eld Amsir looked at Jackson 
and shrugged, “You’ve got one or 
two things to watch out for besides 
the condition of your stomach. One 
of them is the fact that if you 
nudge superstition hard enough 
around here, you won’t live to 
starve. And there’s not much that 
anyone educated will be able to do 
to help you.” 

44TXTe have a very tricky situa- 

VV tion going here,” the in- 
structor Amsir explained. “You see, 
we know there are two Thoms, two 



worlds, two kinds of creatures, and 
we know they were all made at the 
same time. One must be good, and 
the other must be evil. But you see, 
at that point we leave rational logic 
behind, and begin trespassing on 
matters of faith. A great prophet, 
one of whose last discourses I myself 
was privileged to witness as a very 
young being, teUs us that since we 
must make evalutions of our Thom’s 
worth on faith, then it is just as 
logical to believe that each indi- 
vidual makes either good or evil 
of his own place. But, for this the 
great prophet was flung from a 
great height with his wings broken, 
by those who avoid such complicated 
patterns of ethics through the ex- 
pedient of knowing that it is our 
place that is good and yours that 
is evil, and that they are therefore 
good for living in the good place. 

“We here are all reasonable crea- 
tures — granting you a certain 
shrewdness — and we know it is 
probably only an accident of crea- 
tion that your kind of creature and 
mine cannot live in each other’s plac- 
es. But you see how difficult it can 
be to perceive this if one is of a 
tender and uncultured turn of mind.” 

“You can see, too,” the Eld Am- 
sir added, “how brave that young 
fellow was, being as emotional as he 
is, and yet willing to risk waiting 
round the fringes of your world for 
something as imutterably evU and 
repulsive as yourself to come into 
contact with him.” The Eld and the 
instructor both looked at Jackson 
es if they had just told him some- 
thing of considerable meaning and 
exp^ed him to react.

IF 




Jackson just looked back at them. 
For one thing, he didn’t even know 
what “theology” meant. It was the 
apprentice instructor who said: 
“Look at himl He shows no sign of 
understanding! 1 propose the thesis 
they have no concept of original 
evil!” 

“And are therefore innocent?” the 
instructor cried furiously. “Shut up! 
S^ut up!” He waved his wings spas- 
tically, hopping from one foot to 
the other, raising dust. He was pret- 
ty old stidf, and didn’t impress Jack- 
son much, but the apprentice in- 
structor quailed and shuffled away, 
his head bowed. He acted as if 
he’d fallen out while running ’round 
the Thom behind Red Filson — 
tireless, wise, dead Red Filson. What 
makes you dumb, Jackson decided, 
is what scares you. 

XIV 

66X^ou see,” the Eld Amsir said 

: JL to Jackson, “we must dis- 
cover whatever is within the Thom 
Thing. We feel this wkh different 
degrees of involvement.” He glanced 
aside at the instructor, who was 
busUy running his fingertips through 
his lace and geUing it untangled. 
“Feel it for different reasons that 
are very close to our emotions. But 
k’s our only due to the nature and 
purpose of Creation. We’ve studied 
the Thorn for generations, of course, 
but it’s only a machine, and all we 
learn from it is how its parts move 
and in which of those parts it seems 
to be wearing out. It does seem to 
be wearing out in a numb^ of parts. 
Now the Thom Thing, on the other 



hand, talks. Perhaps there is some- 
thing inside that can be talked to.” 

“In what kind of talk?” Jackson 
asked. 

The Eld Amsir nodded. “You’re 
right. Nobody is saying there won’t 
be problems. Nobody is saying the 
answer will be easy to find. But 
we’ve got to begin. Things are not 
getting any better, so they can only 
get worse. We can’t just let them 
go. Oh, there are many of our kind 
of creatures w’ho would never care 
until the last moment when the 
sky fell down upon them. All they 
care about is getting their food to 
eat, water to drink, sky to fly in. 
And there have always been these 
things, so they can’t imagine that 
they could end. But we know the 
Thorn can end. So these things can 
end — there can be a last day for 
this world. There are some of us 
who cannot live content, knowing 
this, even though we may also know 
that we would 'be able to die content 
long before it becomes necessary to 
really have the answers we seek. 
There is a certain quirk — a restless- 
ness — in certain minds, which does 
not seem to understand the passage 
of time. What will be real some day 
to everyone is very real to them 
now.” 

Jackson listened politely. 

“Now, I bear you no malice, boy. 
If we had food here that you could 
eat, I would give it to you, provided. 
Provided I thought you would work 
just as hard at opening the door as 
you would if you were starving. 
Others may bear you malice, but 1 
don’t. I understand that we are 
really very much alike, inside. And 



THE IRON THORN 



97 




I like the idea of your beio^ an odd 
one. I am an odd one too, among my 
own kind.” He pointed toward the 
Thorn Thing. “That’s where I was 
mangled. 

“I wouldn’t leave it alone. I tried 
to crawl up one of its throats, but 
I was clumsy. As all of us who do 
not need the ground all our lives 
are clumsy when we crawl. My 
clumsiness saved my life. I fell to 
the ground. When the fire burst 
forth from the throat to clear me 
out, I was already crawling away. 
But still it caught me and threw 
me a good distance. Haw, they called 
it the reward of foolishness. It was 
then, as I lay there screaming, and 
they gathered around laughing and 
exclaiming, that I understood I must 
either rule them or not live here 
any longer. So I owe much to the 
Thorn Thing. I owe much to odd- 
ness. And I tell you, odd one, that 
you had better owe much to it too. 
I bear you no malice — I said that 
— but I will do whatever needs to 
be done to force the utmost from 
you. I will remind you, if you 
haven’t thought of it yourself already, 
that it treats your kind of creatures 
better than it treats my kind. My 
kind cannot climb the ladder to its 
top, nor touch the door. Something 
goes into my kind of creature from 
the door, flattens its insides, boils 
it eyes, throws it dead instantly 
earthward. Your kind of creature 
it merely permits to starve while at- 
tempting to crawl through the 
throats, or while picking at the 
door seam. Therefore, what is in- 
side will probably not treat you like 
an enemy. It may help you. Why not 



believe that there is your sort of 
food in there? What is a friend for, 
if not to offer hospitality? And I 
think you will do well. You are 
very much like me, and if my body 
were like yours, I think I would do 
weW.” 

Jackson said; “You know, I think 
you’re ri^t. There is somebody who 
lives in our Thorn that I think you 
could spend a lot of happy hours 
with. Just talking. Comparing prob- 
lems, sharing thoughts.” But the Am- 
sir Eld didn’t seem to understand. 
He looked at Jackson the way Jack- 
son looked at people who used words 
like theology. Well, Jackson decided, 
it was possible to talk, talk, talk about 
how alike they were under the skin, 
but if you had become the Eld of 
the Amsirs, you couldn’t really 
think there was anyone else who’d 
made out as wonderful as you. 

The way, when I was a kid, 
Jackson thought, I thought there 
was only one world, and the only 
thing in it was honning. He looked 
around at the Amsirs, the blue food 
he couldn’t eat, the stilty houses, 
the sky filled with flapping crea- 
tures and the Thorn Thing. And I 
wish, he thought, I wish I was still 
like those farmers and Honors back 
there who still think that’s all there 
is. 

He felt pretty tired. “I’m going 
to get some sleep,” he said, lay 
down, curled up, and closed his 
eyes around the throbbing of his 
arm. 

W ow, his arm hurt. He scraped 
his eyes open and looked down 
at it. The flesh of his hand was 



98 



IF 




swollen up in a ring around the 
lower edge of the wrapping. When 
he reached up to touch his shoul- 
der he found another bulge like it 
there. He rolled over in the dust 
near the Thorn Thing, rubbing his 
hair in his face, pawing his open 
mouth, licking his teeth. He saw 
it was morning again. His skin felt 
dry. He couldn’t get his face to 
work. He sat up, and saw the Amsir 
Eld sitting there. “Huh! Been guard- 
ing my rest?” 

“Mine, too. I’ve been wondering 
what the effect of long rest on your 
energy supply would be. You don’t 
seem to have become more alert.” 

Jackson moved. He had it pretty 
well planned; the next step was to 
get around behind the Eld, hook his 
arms under the Eld’s wings, using 
the left arm for whatever good it 
might do, and get his right thumb 
into the front of the Eld’s throat, 
while his fingers curled around the 
back of the Amsir’s neck. From 
there, he figured, he could start set- 
ting himself up a little more com- 
fortably around here. He didn’t 
know exactly what the Amsirs could 
really do to get him something to 
eat, for instance, but there was a 
whole world here, full of brave, 
strong, big-mouthed people, who 
were used to doing what the Eld 
told them. And if the Eld had to do 
what Jackson told him .... 

But the Eld had had the thought 
to tie Jackson’s ankles together 
loosely while he slept, and Jackson 
fell down. 

The Eld grinned. “In a few days, 
it won’t be necessary to do that, 
or anything like it. Then you’ll be 



waking up with only one thougiht. 
If need be, I may have to remind 
you that breakfast is inside the 
Thorn Thing. Then you will turn to 
it with a will.” 

Lying there, thinking all kinds of 
top-of-the-head, fast-answer thoughts, 
Jackson said, “I believe a lot more 
in you for breakfast than in any 
instructor talk about what’s inside 
that thing.” 

The Eld said: “It’s truly amazing 
what you’ll believe in a few days. 
It’s not a pretty condition. I think 
you will disgust yourself. I don’t 
think you would like that any more 
than I would. We have let you sleep. 
Here is water,” he said, setting out 
one of those sealed hide bubbles of 
theirs. “That we can give you. We 
won’t be shocked — I won’t be 
shocked — if you smear some on 
skin. Does your arm hurt?” 

“Thanks.” 

The Amsir nodded off over Jack- 
son’s shoulder, and the doctor came 
up again. He unwrapped the band- 
ages while Jackson drank and stared 
off at the rim of the world through 
the legs of the houses. When the 
doctor was done putting fresh wrap- 
pings on the arm and was restopper- 
ing his bottle of liquid he said: “Your 
arm’s not healing. I think you’ll soon 
lose it.” 

“I knew that yesterday,” Jack- 
son said. He tossed the water bubble 
down. “There’s something you can 
work on me with,” he said to the 
Eld. “Maybe there is something in 
the Thorn Thing that’ll fix my arm. 
Some kind of real doctor. Why not? 
If there’s a feast for me in there, 
there might as well be healing, too.” 



THE IRON THORN 



99 




T he Eld was untying the ends of 
the thongs between Jackson’s 
ankles; his wings got in his way 
a little, and he was clumsy about 
it, but he got them off anyhow. 
There were a couple of spearmen 
staading around, Jackson noticed 
now. It hadn’t mattered ibefore if 
they were there or not, because when 
you make that kind of play there’s 
no point counting odds. But he had 
shot that one, and he noticed them 
now. He held still. 

“And if not healing, why not 
anything else, too?” the Eld was say- 
ing as he worked. “Indeed, why not? 
Why not females, why not any other 
pleasures that migjit appeal to you? 
Why not weapons? And you thought 
of weapons in there, didn’t you?” 
The Eld looked up shrewdly, his 
eyes twinkling. “Oh, have you not!” 
Jackson shrugged. 

The Eld shrugged too. “And why 
not? Why not, if you crack open 
a mystery from the beginning of 
time, why not all lore, all striving, 
all rewards for the shrewd and the 
odd? Pfu! Let me show you the 
answer to that.” He gestured with 
a wingtip, and a couple of spearmen 
hustled something forward from be- 
hind the Thorn. 

The creature smiled winningly at 
Jackson. It smiled at the Spearmen, 
it smiled at the Amsir Eld, and 
at the instructor, and in fact at 
everything. Jackson had never seen 
an)Tthing so easily pleased. 

It was a shame it was so un- 
pleasant. It stood just about his size, 
and it walked — at a guess — like 
a man. But it was a little hard to 
tell, because it sagged so much. It 



was hke dough, and the color of 
dough. There was no part of it 
whose skin did not hang down in 
sloughy folds, except at the very 
top of its head, where little fleshy 
pseudopods spangled half-erect about 
where an Amsir’s crest of lace be- 
gan. The rest of it hung on its 
frame of bones and meat, half-closed 
its eyes, drooped little beginnings 
of ears, made a flabby ruff around 
the neck, hung in a brief, scalloped 
cape around its chest and upper 
arms, made another fold below its 
waist, and fell on down its legs. 
It was, if it was dough, some Am- 
sir housewife’s too-watery bit of 
kneading from which an Amsir pas- 
try might have been baked. 

All this delighted it. Its soft flap- 
fingered hands — the little finger 
rather longer than the others — 
twiddled constantly at its thighs, 
its shoulders, and its face. It seemed 
to love playing with its mouth. 
How it smiled was by stretching 
its lips upward with its forefingers 
quite frequently. 

T he Amsir Eld looked crooked- 
ly toward Jackson. Jackson 
obliged: “All right — what is it?” 
“Oh, this is Ahmuls,” he said. 
“He’s a kind of creature t>om to 
us now and then. He happens to be 
one of the few who does noc die 
while still very, very young. Well, his 
mother was a foolish woman and 
fond of him. And I am grateful to 
her now. You’ll see why. Ahmuls 
is very lovable,” the Eld said as 
the creature shuffled up to him, 
still twiddling. The Eld reached out 
and lightly stroked Ahmul’s cheek. 



TOO 



IF 




“Good morning, Ahmuls; I love 
you.” 

“Good -morning, I love yow,” 
Ahmuls said rather clearly. He 
hummed some sort of contented 
sound and stroked the Eld’s cheek. 

“Ahmuls — this is Jackson,” the 
Eld said, pointing. 

“Jackson . ” Ahmuls said 
reflectively, opening his eyes with 
thumbs and forefingers as he focused 
his attention. 

“Ahmuls, I want you to show 
Jackson something.” 

“Oh, yes.” 

“Very good,” the Eld said, strok- 
ing Ahmul’s face again. “Ahmuls, 
hit that for me.” The Eld pointed 
to the leg of a house a dozen run- 
ning strides distant. The Eld threw 
in an aside to Jackson: “Like many 
odd ones, Ahmuls has had to be 
special, or go under. He’s very proud 
of thing’s he’s taught himself to 
do. They show he loves himself, 
and since we all love ourselves so 
very much, when we do something 
for that sort of love we’re superb. 
Ahmuls . ?” The Eld looked 
questioningly at Ahmuls. 

Ahmuls turned to one of the 
spearmen, floppy-fleshed arm ex- 
tended. He said neither please nor I 
love you. The Eldish sudden uplift 
of his arm did all the necessary 
asking for him. The spearman didn’t 
seem offended. He gave his javelin a 
bit of a toss, and Ahmuls caught it 
in mid-air, thumb down, with his 
arm crossed in front of him, still 
turned three quarters away from his 
target. The next Jackson saw him 
clearly he was already stepping for- 
ward, his muscles already relaxing 



again, and the javelin was going 
through the air in an absolutely 
straight line, whirring. Jackson had 
never seen anything thrown that 
didn’t curve down toward the end 
of its path. A dozen dozen running 
strides away the head of the javelin 
went into the house-leg with a klat!, 
a whip of its metal body, then 
a crack as the shaft snapped away 
from the immovably dug-in head. 
Up above indignant voices boiled up, 
and heads and bodies showed at the 
doorway. Then a voice came faintly 
down, pleased as well as scandal- 
ized: “Oh, Ahmuls!” And Jackson 
had been shown what love could do. 

T he Eld said: “I love Ahmuls,” 
grinned and grinned. 

Pfu! thought Jackson. 

The Eld stepped forward and 
took gentle hold of Ahmul’s arm. 
“Watch, Jackson.” He pulled the 
flesh tight, for just a moment, and 
there was the outline of the hu- 
man arm trapped under the un- 
cooked Amsir skin. 

“You see,” the Eld went on to 
Jackson, “this is also why I love 
Ahmuls. But let me show you #iAt» 
too. Ahmuls — climb the ladder. 
Show Jackson you can climb the 
ladder, Ahmuls.” 

Ahmuls held his eyes open again, 
hunted, found the two things he 
had to know about. “Jackson,” he 
discovered. “Ladder.” Satisfied, he 
was beside the Thorn Thing wi^ 
two strides, halfway up the ladder 
with one jump, and at its head 
immediately thereafter. He stood 
with his feet curled over the top 
rung, and the only thing that kept

him from falling backwards was 
tkat he leaned forward with his 
arms outstretched, oozed tight 
against the curving surface, and 
wkile the door growled he rubbed 
his face against the metal and mov- 
ed his flatteued palms in little car- 
ressing motions. Jackson raised an 
ear with a twist of his neck that 
reminded him about shoulders, and 
could hear Ahmuls very faintly: 
“I love you.” 

“Come down now, Ahmuls,” the 
Eld cried. “So you see,” he said 
to Jackson, “the door thinks Ah- 
muis is your kind of creature, for 
it doesn’t kill him. True, Ahmuls is 
very stupid, and so there’s no hope 
of his ever opening the door. But 
that’s good for you, when you thmk 
of it, for if Ahmuls weren’t stupid, 
I wouldn’t need you. An3^ay, Ah- 
muls goes in with you, if you open 
the door. He knows enough to hit 
you if you pick up a weapon. He’s 
been told all about it many times 
in the past. He will imderstand 
something if it’s said to him a few 
times. After that, he is too gluey in- 
side to forget it.” 

Ahmuls had come back to the 
Eld. They changed touches again. 
“Love you,” both of them said. 

Jackson studied them. 

The Eld said to Jackson: “There 
is only one way you can keep Ah- 
muls from waiting just below you 
on the ladder while you try the 
door and then following you in. 
That would be to cripple him now. 
I still need you, and I have no 
replacement for Ahmuls. You 
wouldn’t be punished, and you’d 
have a much better diance once 



you got inside. So I’m perfectly 
willing to let you try your luck 
right now.” 

Jackson walked over to Ahmuls. 
He reached out with his good hand, 
while shaking his head at the Eld. 
Then he looked straight into Ah- 
mul’s slitty eyes as he fondled the 
damp thing’s cheek. “I love you.” 

But Ahmuls wasn’t having any. 
He caught Jackson’s hand with 
something that felt like a five- 
fingered machine closing on it in- 
side a cloak of blanketing. Some- 
where inside all there, Ahmul’s 
sense of touch got a message 
through to his head. “No good,” he 
said, rubbing Jackson’s hand be- 
fore throwing the arm aside. “Soft.” 

XV 

t was hot, up at the top of the 
ladder with Ahmul’s humming 
happily a few rungs below him. Jack- 
son ran his hands over the door 
again, and again found that it was 
exactly like any other door, except 
that it didn’t have a handle, smd 
it talked. He had gotten used to 
the growling. There were those 
scratches around the edges, where 
various hands before ihim had tried 
to pry. One or two of the scratches 
actually went maybe a fingernail- 
thickness deeper ^an the surface. 
The Eld had told him they were 
places where everybody sooner or 
later came to scratching in old 
scratches, trying to just plain wear 
through. 

The Eld’s best estimate was that 
the deepest scratch had taken about 
a dozen men, working day and night,

IF 




for maybe two weeks apiece. And it 
was as thick as two hands. But 
it was possible, Jackson thought, 
that a week or ten days from now 
he might start telling himself maybe 
this door wasn’t that thick — maybe 
it was only a finger thick. Probably, 
the last two or three days he could 
hang on up there, he’d be telling 
himself he’d wear through any min- 
ute now. 

The door was easy to get mad 
at. It was just another oval seam 
in the metal. A sensible man with 
other things to do would tell him- 
self inside of an hour that it wasn’t 
a door — it was some kind of fake 
wrinkle in the metal. He could 
climb back down the ladder and 
never try it again. There wasn’t 
even a place for the voice to come 
out. It was the first time Jackson 
had ever met anything that could 
talk but didn’t have a mouth. 

He put his ear up to the door, 
trying to hear the heartbeat he could 
feel through his fingertips, but when 
he did that the voice went right 
through his head, and he couldn’t 
hear anything but it. He leaned out 
as far as he dared and looked it 
up and down again, and then he 
said: “Hey, Ahmuls, let’s go down.” 

“Down?” 

“Down. Let’s go down 

“You’re stupid,” Ahmuls said, but 
he moved obligingly down, one rung 
at a time, making sure Jackson came 
with him. 

The instructing Amsir, who’d 
beep keeping a sharp eye on this 
public tooling, came hurrying up 
to them. “What’s wrong?” 

Ahmuls grinned and pointed at 



Jackson. “He came down. He’s stu- 
pid.” 

“I’ve learned all I’m going to, up 
there,” Jackson said. 

“Where else are you going to 
learn anything?” 

“That’s the real problem, I guess 
— answering that one. But I’ve 
learned everything I’m going to up 
there,” Jackson said, and walked 
toward the Thorn. 

“Don’t you leave me!” Ahmuls 
cried, taking Jackson’s good arm. 

“It’s all right, Ahmuls dear,” the 
instructing Amsir said hastily. “You 
wait here. I’ll bring him back. He’ll 
be with me.” 

“All right. But you bring him 
back,” Ahmuls said dubiously. 

“\^at are you going to do?” the 
instructing Amsir said, rustling 
along beside Jackson, his eyes glit- 
tering with intense curiosity. 

“Study door,” Jackson said. He 
jerked his thumb toward the Tlwm. 
“Quite a few of them in there.” 

H e stood in doorways all that 
afternoon, bracing his feet and 
elbows inside the oval door jambs 
as best he could, trying to under- 
stand how it felt to be that thick, 
that tall, that flat” He growled 
grudgingly out of various Amsirs’ 
way whenever they came shuffling 
and scraping up itie halls through 
him. He swung himself flat against 
a wall and stood that way for a 
long time, his fingers and toes curved 
around the jamb, being hinges. By 
the end of the afternoon, he had 
a pretty good idea inside his head 
of how a door would think, and 
act, and feel about people. But al- 



THE IRON THORN 



103 




ways, only a door that had a han- 
dle ^ough its middle. 

By evening, the little hollow place 
that he put through his middle where 
the handle’s works would be had 
grown up into something that he 
had to admit resembled the faint 
beginning of hunger in a man who 
let himself think about food. That 
was the only gain he had to show 
for the day, and he had to admit it 
was a loss. Toward evening, Ahmuls 
came looking for him, unhappy be- 
cause the instructor didn’t love him 
or he would have brought Jackson 
back, imhappy because Jackson still 
wouldn’t go up the ladder, unhappy 
becatise the sun was going down 
and it was time to go back, to 
sleep, to wait for morning and the 
ladder, and Jackson again, and 
meanwhile not be loved. 

I B the morning, he climbed back 
up the ladder. Ahmuls patted him 
approvingly on the shoulder as he 
stood aside to let him by. “Now 
you’re smart,” he said. 

“Glad to hear it,” Jackson said. 
The doctor had re-done his arm 
again, with the usual results. Jack- 
son could feel that arm all the way 
up his neck and into the inside of 
his head, this fine morning in the 
bright sky with all the happy Am- 
sirs flopping in the sky above him, 
and Ahmuls slurring and slapping 
up the ladder below him. When he 
got to the top, he sat down facing 
outward, leaning his back and the 
back of his head against the metal, 
his feet resting on the next rung 
down, letting himsdf warm up. 
He kept him arms crossed over him. 



He began to talk casually. “You 
know, door, I spent a long time last 
night trying to be like you.” 

The door said: “Ouwwtenshownn. 
Dhayss dwuuhrr uhhpnns owwnn- 
uhhli ...” and so forth. 

“Didn’t do any good. Man can’t 
be a door. Can pretend to be a 
door — can tell himself he is a 
door. But a man doesn’t have hinges. 
Anyway he doesn't have the kind 
of hinges a door does. And a man 
can’t be a door like you at all, 
because a man has handles.” 

“ . dhaysstroyd wieyethouyut 
dhayaysscriyeshunn,” the door said. 

“Then I got to thinking to my- 
self, door,” Jackson said, paying 
no mind as the door began again. 

“Heyl You talkin’ to me?” Ah- 
muls said peevishly from below. 
“No.” 

“AwwU ouwwthrr uhluff-fouwrr- 
mus ...” said the door. 

“1 got to thinking that if a maa 
can’t be a door, can a door be a 
man? And 1 guess we both know 
the answer to that. You’re stupid, 
door. You tell the difference be- 
tween my kind of creature and a 
Amsir; you’re supposed to keep 
Amsirs out, so it figures maybe 
you’re supposed to let men in. I 
mean, even the instructor has got 
that much figured out. And their 
Eld has it figured out, so that 
clinches it. But you won’t let me 
in. You don’t knock me off, but 
you don’t let me in. You don’t 
knock Ahmuls off either, and that’s 
a mistake. No, no two ways about 
it — you’re stupid. So 1 got to 
thinking, how do I get through a 
stupid door that thinks it’s a man.”

. wieyethouyut dhaysscriye- 
shunn.” 

J ackson turned his head in a way 
that looked pretty casual and 
idle, and would have been casual 
in somebody whose arm didn’t hurt 
all the way into his head. Ahmuls 
was right diere, looking up at him. 
Over the many times Ahmuls had 
had tihis kind of duty, he’d learned 
that if he hung his head back and 
twisted his shoulders so diat he 
was looking upside-down, he didn’t 
have to hold the loose skin away 
from his eyes. “Love you,” Jack- 
son said. 

“You’re awful,” Ahmuls answered 
decisively. 

“Well, I was saying, door — 
you’re stupid. But you’ve got ears, 
and you can feel, and 1 guess you 
can see, too, even if you can’t talk 
straight.” 

“. t umm-nn pehrrsowwnnuhll.” 
“Now the thing is, door, if you 
won’t let me in, and you won’t let 
Amsirs in, what did you ever let 
out that you won’t let back in? It 
would have to be something that 
talks like you, but looks like me, 
wouldn’t it, door? Or, anyway,” 
Jackson said, listening to Ahmids 
hum through the sound of the door 
going on talking, “anyway, some- 
thing soft. 

“But you’ve been here since the 
beginning of time. What happened 
to what you let out, way back then? 
Door, 1 figure somewhere you’ve 
got a picture of what you should 
let bade in. A pidure ^at talks, 1 
guess, but 1 figure that^s what you’ve 
got to have. Something to let you 
, v; 

106 



compare. Something you’re much 
too stupid to forget.” 

It was getting hot again. Jackson 
wiped his face. 

The instructing Amsir was getting 
all excited down below. He cupped 
his beak in his hand and shouted 
up: “Ahmuls! What’s he doing up 
there?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Then why has the door stopped 
growling?” 

Jackson took a long, deep breath. 
He turned around and looked at 
the door, holding on tight with his 
good hand and with the best he 
could do with his bad one. It would 
be no time to fall off now. “You 
dumb door!” he said. “This is only 
the first thing I thought of to try.” 

Down below him, Ahmuls was 
shifting his grip too, forgetting he 
couldn’t see as well right side up 
as he could upside down. 

“All right, door — if I’ve got you 
started thinking again after all this 
time — all right, if you do listen 
better than you talk, tl^n you figure 
what you let out would talk hke 
by now. It can’t be that hard!” he 
said, suddenly irritated. “If that 
instructor can figure out some of 
your words, something smart enough 
to tell the difference between a 
Amsir and a man should be able to 
figure out my words. Open up, you 
dumb bastardr he cried. 

The beat of the Thorn Thing’s 
heart changed. Ihere was a creak, 
a suck, a pop. The door jumped 
back the thickness of a finger and 
zipped sideways, into a place made 
for it to slide into in the skin of 
the Thorn Thing. 



IF 




J ackson scrambled around on the 
ladder. Down below him the 
Eld was a little slow getting things 
organized. There were spearmen 
throwing, but they hadn’t really got- 
ten themselves set. 

The whole thing was happening 
too fast for everybody. Jackson 
hadn’t really figmed the door would 
make sense out of what he said, 
and for all of his talking, the Eld 
hadn’t figured Jackson would get 
the door open this fast, if ever. So 
all that quiet, unspoken thinking of 
the Eld’s about how once the door 
was open he didn’t need Jackson 
at all, as long as he had Ahmuls 
or another creatures of Jackson’s 
kind who maybe wouldn’t be as 
tricky — well, all that thinking was 
shot, too, because Jackson was in 
through the door, and into a dark 
little room, banging Ihiiiiself up, 
laughing and cursing, before the 
spearmen got into the air. In fact, 
the only one who stayed cool was 
Ahmuls. He’d been told what to 
do a lot of times, and now he did 
it. He flipped h^df in through 
the door and crouched rippling next 
to where Jackson was lying on the 



floor. “I come, too,” he said, hap- 
py to be useful. 

Jackson let out his breath as the 
first couple of spears came buzzing 
in through the doorway from ner- 
vous, fluttering spearmen and 
bounced off the walls. “I guess you 
do.” 

There was this other door at the 
end of the little room. There was 
a red, bright lamp shining over 
it. Then the outside door closed, 
the light went out, yellow light came 
on from overhead in the little room, 
and the inside door opened. Past it 
were all kinds of things that looked 
like what Jackson guessed was 
Thom machinery. Through the metal 
around them, he and Ahmuls both 
could hear the outside door hol- 
lering as spears hit. Its voice was 
too fast, too high. It sounded as 
panicky as everybody. 

“Attention! Attentioal This sys- 
tem has now been adjusted to ac- 
celerated speech mode. lUa door 
opens only to human personneL AU 
other life forms will be desttoyed 
without discretion. An intdligible 
warning has been given.” 

“It was about time,” Jackson smd.

THE IRON THORN 






IF * Short Story 



CONFESSION 

by ROBERT RAY 



They brought Earth a message 
— not to preach it, but to act 
on it at the cost of their lives! 



44-^T^lie orange-^blood sunset over 

' A CoUabirrian,” thought Fath- 
er Hume, and the sounds of words 
inside his head made a pleasing 
rhythm. For a moment they made 
him forget even the heat. For a 
moment. 

Then it was back again. 

To be precise, the summer heat 
in the Northern Territory of Aus- 
tralia never quite left. One could 
divert oneself with an urgent piece 
of work, or with worry, but only 
momentarily. Then the heat seeped 
back into one again with the merci- 
less squandering the sun here could 
afford. 

Sighing, Father Hume lowered 
himself into a cane chair, his eyes 
looking emptily at the back of be- 
yond. By heaven, it was the back 
of beyond. He was sitting on the 



verandah of his house, which was 
situated right on the outskirts of 
the township and gave an unin- 
terrupted view of soil wounding it- 
self with mercy-begging cracks, with 
trees jutting forlornly from the 
corpse-looking ground. F^om half 
the trees smoke belched as they 
burned hollow from the self-com- 
bustion that created, seemingly, 
never ending heat. 

It was hell. 

“Forgive me, my Lord,” added 
Father Hume numbly in his mind, 
“but maybe the old artists were 
right. And this certainly is like it.” 

The heat was hard even on native 
Australians. For Father Hume, who 
had only left dewy Devon less than 
two years ago, it was like. ... He 
shied away from the thought. 

“What should I be doing then 



108 



tonight?” he asked himself. Then 
immediately he dosed his eyes, 
pushed the question back and 
mournfully decided just to exist un- 
til the night came, with its diim- 
mery relief of cool breezes. Any- 
thing under 90 degrees was con- 
sidered cool. 

Afterwards, Father Hume could 
have sworn that he merely closed 
his eyes for a moment, no longer 
than was necessary to kill the con- 
cept of doing something more than 
sitting. But, be it a moment or a 
few minutes, he should have seen 
the stranger approaching. After all, 
from the buckled edges of his ver- 
andah looking in a straight line 
ahead, even if there were two or 
three blackened tree stumps in the 
way, he could see miles in most 
directions, because there simply 
wasn’t anything. 

Except heat. 

This time, though, there was a 
man. 

H e was tall and very thin. He 
walked towards Father Hume 
with. 

For a moment the good f ather dis- 
regarded the way the stranger look- 
ed, he was so taken up with the 
way the man was moving. Dignity. 
Maybe it was the way he carried his 
shoulders, straight. Or the gentle 
solidarity of his arms, swinging 'be- 
side his body. Or the way his long 
and thin legs carried him. There 
was no heat for the stranger, heat 
which exhausts a man by just being. 

He made good speed too. By the 
time Father Hume got to his feet, 
the man was walking through 



where the fence of the back garden 
was supposed to be repaired. As 
Father Hume diufQed to the heat- 
waiped lean-on pole of the veran- 
dah, the stranger was only a couple 
of yards away. He stopped there 
and smiled at Father Hume. 

“I need your help. Father,” said 
the stranger, the smile still on his 
face. 

The man wore dirty dungarees 
and an army shirt, the buttons either 
missing or simply unbuttoned. His 
dusty feet were in worn sandals. 
His face was longish, most of its 
surface sprouting with days-old 
beard, and the balding dome was 
surrounded with short blond hair. 
Father Hume was fascinated by 
two things: The calm look from 
the man’s eyes and his quiet, ef- 
fortless baritone voice. His voice 
lacked the special whine which so 
often accompanied those words. 

“Of course,” Father Hume near- 
ly added “son,” but there was too 
much dignity in the man. No, the 
right word flashed into his mind: 
it was “equality.” 

“I’d say come into the house, 
but it’s worse in there. Do I know 
you?” 

“No, Father. I am new in these 
parts,” answered the man, his words 
still clothed in that relaxed smile. 
Walking around the verandah, he 
sat down on the edge and waited. 

“Maybe you’d like some cold 
drink. I have some canned beer in 
the fridge.” 

“No, thank you. Father.” 

It was all so strange. Australians, 
even in the city, were a friendly 
type of people, hi the out-back they

all had that chummy opeimess about 
them which made even a c^es^on 
a relatively cheerful affair. iSSs|h!ag» 
he pulled the cane diair nearer to 
the edge of the veraiKlaii and turned 
it to face the quiet man. He felt 
awkward about his appearance. But 
who could wear a proper clerical 
outfit in a climate like this? None- 
theless, his right hand automatically 
went to his open-neck shirt, his 
fingers, embarrassed, fastening one 
button. 

“Ypo know, I can’t get over the 
way suddenly appeared here. 1 
thoi^^ I only closed my eyes for a 
momc^ and when 1 opened them 
again, there you were strolling in 
the back yard. How did you get 
here?** 

“ni come to that in a moment. 
Father,” said the stranger without 
hesitaition. “Actually, that is part 
of my story.” 

“Yes, of course,” said Father 
Hume. “Wiat can I do for you, 
then?” 

“A confession. Partly it is a 
confession. Father.” 

“Now see here, my son, if you 
are of the Faith, you know per- 
fecfly well it can’t be such a casual 
affair. Tomorrow is Sunday. Why 
don’t you. ...” 

“I will be dead by tomorrow. 
Father,” said the man, quietly, and 
still with the smile. 

F ather Hume sat up straight in his 
chair, feeling anger and be- 
wilderment. 

“If tbis is your idea of a joke, 
stranger, I find it very tasteless.” 

“It is not a joke, Father. My con- 



fession is as real as my death. In 
fact, one is a part of the other.” 
llie man is mad, thought Father 
Hume. Maybe the heat. He said: 
“You sound very certain about 
it. In fact, it almost makes me think 
you are contemplating taking your 
own life. In which case of course I 
could never be able to accept your 
confession.” 

“It is my kind of confession. 
Father, not yours. You see, I am 
a priest, too. But I am an alien.” 
The stranger leaned to the comer 
of the house, his hands resting in 
his lap, waiting. 

“Yes, you have an accent. 
Did you say you were a priest?” 
“Yes.” 

“Might I ask what denomination? 
And where do you come from?” 
The next sound was the shrill 
laughter of a kocka-burra which 

alighted on a nearby tree. The 

stranger looked at the bird, then 

turning his head, at the far distance 
where the almost sunken disk of the 
sun was radiating the skyline with 
orange red. His right hand moved 
up slowly, like a petal faling up- 
wards, his fingers pointing. 

“I came from there, Father.” 
“Where?” 

“If you travelled straight on in 
that direction, Father, first you 

would leave your sun behind, then 
your solar system, then your galaxy. 
There are suns and planets in the 
untold billions, there are star sys- 
tems which leave one weak with 
humility, and there, way away there, 
is my world, similar to yours. That 
is where I come from.” 

Mad. No, he corrected himself 

IF 



110 




hastily. The poor chs^ is ill. Father 
Hume tried to keep up wA the 
modem trends, and, suice it seemed 
essential, he even read a few volumes 
on psy<^ology and mental health. 
What was this, paranoid or schizo- 
phrenic? Whi^ one was it that 
created a world populated by their 
own weird creatures? 

“Of course, you think that I am 
mad. In your place I would think 
precisely the same,” said the stran- 
ger softly. 

Yes, yes, but wasn’t that one of 
the points? Often these cases, apart 
from their idee fixe, sound so ra- 
tional. ... He had to say some- 
thing. 

“Well — ” Father Hume was con- 
scious that not only was his shirt 
soaked with perspiration, but now 
even his hand^ were coated with a 
fine film of moistme — “who can 
tell where we come from?” 

“Naturally, I expected this re- 
action. Forgive me. It is essential 
that 1 show you something.” 

Before he could stop himself, 
the priest set his feet against the 
wooden boards, pushing his chair 
back a few inches. 

“No, don’t be alarmed, I will 
not move. I asked your forgiveness 
because I must show you something, 
and to do that I will have to utilize 
your own mind. I just want you 
to understand that we would never 
do this without permission. But I 
have so little time.” 

Now there was urgency in the 
stranger’s voice, but he still sat 
there unmoving. Only his eyes lived. 
Vibrated? Father Hume cried out 
in astonishment. 



H e could still see the strange, 
who called himsdf an alien 
and a priest. He was still sitting on 
the edge of the verandah; but, as 
he stared ahead something almost 
like a gigantic television screen 
opened the vista of a new world. 

“This is where I came from,” 
said the stranger. His thin figure 
at the edge of the picture was fram- 
ed by the orange-red sky. 

The giant screen now nearly en- 
folded Father Hume, and he stared 
with fear and incredulity at the 
scene. It looked like open country: 
thick grass, like a hand-knitted lawn, 
strange trees, with terribly tall, thin 
trunks, but their foilage resembled 
an umbrella spread wide in an 
enormous distance. It was broad 
daylight there, with one of the 
suns high in the sky, the other half- 
way to the horizon. 

One of die suns! 

The enormity of what he was see- 
ing chilled his skin. 

The colors were wrong too. The 
grasses were green, but there was 
more than a suggestion of purple 
in them; the trees had blue bark, 
their leaves nearly lost to the eye 
against the vivid blue sky. Well, 
at least the sky was the right color. 

“My world has a much lower 
gravity than yours. Father,” he heard 
the stranger say. “That’s vriiy vege- 
tation grows taller. And so do we.” 
Now the picture seemed to be 
gliding forward. The original set- 
ting was a meadow; now they were 
out over hills, leaving behind a 
riot of color, where unearthly 
flowers dotted in bunches like gi- 
gantic buttons. 



CONFESSION 



111 




“Dear Lord,” whispered Father 

Hume. 

“There is no need for alarm, 
Father. It is just a way to show you 
what we are, where we come from. 
There is no magic attached to this; 
we merely have a small measure 
of what you’d call ESP. Nothing 
dramatic. We can’t move mountains, 
nor can we teleport from world 
to world. Nor, for that matter, 
can we represent pictorial mem- 
ories that we don’t personally have. 
If, for example, I tried to show 
you part of my world with which 
I am not familiar, it would be the 
same as if you tried to tell me 
about China, if you had never 
been there. Flashes of scenes such 
as you might have seen in a book 
or film, but no continuity. You see, 
this is the town where 1 came from.*’ 

Near, maybe a mile away, Father 
Hume was gazing at a magnificent 
city. The buildings were very tall 
and made of some translucent ma- 
terial, showing colors and shapes 
hke the most beautiful mirage ever 
seen. He could see that the grass 
and the trees and the flowers went 
right up to the edge of the dty, 
like a wall-^waM carpet, forming 
a perfect unity between nature and 
men. 

The stranger was still in the very 
edge of his vision, unmoving. 

‘Who are you?” shouted Father 
Hume, knowing that if this were 
true, his whole life, those years 
in the seminary, those years where 
faith and reality provoked bloody 
battlefields inside his mind, were 
gone and useless. There was power 
here and beauty. Feeling more than 



understanding. Father Hume was 
desperately afraid. 

"*Apage, Satanasr he said and 
closed his eyes. 

T he stranger, sitting in the semi- 
darkness, disappeared from 
view, but the un-world scene re- 
mained. 

“I am not the Devil, Father, 
and what you see is inside your 
mind.” 

Opening his eyes. Father Hume 
feared he knew not what. 

“\Wiy?” he whispered. 

“These are my people,” said the 
stranger softly. 

He could see them coming. The 
stranger must have used a mental 
shorthand, because it wasn’t a pro- 
gressive picture, a flowing line. One 
moment he was looking at the city 
inerging sensuously with the earth, 
the next he was watching a large 
group of the stranger’s kin com- 
ing towards him. They were close, 
only a few hundred yards away. 

There were children, and there 
were adults. They were all terribly 
tall, with the cMdren smaller in 
proportion, all dressed in decep- 
tively simple garments made of 
some semitransparent material and 
all of a different hue. They formed 
a large circle, at one side of the 
circle a group of them separate, 
and within the circle were a handful 
of grown-ups and a couple of dozen 
children. 

All who formed the circle were 
singing, the group to one side pro- 
viding the strong, main melody. 
Those in the circle began to dance. 
It was perfection.

IF 




The melody was soft one v mo- 
ment, to turn into steel hardness 
the next. There was gratefulness in 
the tone, followed by promise ador- 
ation. The dancers offered love and 
dignity with their movements, and 
throng both the sound and the 
dance there was a feeling of im- 
helievable unity. 

And faith. 

“No,” groaned Father Hume. 
“No! Stop it.” 

“That was a service to God that 
you saw,” said the stranger. 

Why didn’t he move? Was he a 
man or was he a gargoyle, created 
by repressed memories of guilt, 
which he so often tried to hide 
with the shape of his collars? 

“Dear God ...” started Father 
Hume. 

“The same in whom I too, be- 
lieve,” interrupted the stranger. 

“I asked you who you were,” 
demanded Father Hume. 

“My name doesn’t matter. Fath- 
er, nor does the name of my world. 
We didn’t materialize, but traveled 
a long, long while, using a method 
which I know nothing about and 
which you will not discover for 
thousands of your years — if ever.” 

“We?” asked Father Hume. 

“Yes. We. We are missionaries.” 

The priest wanted to jump up 
and shout, but he could do neither. 
Inside his body, his muscles were 
individual animals tearing at their 
invisible yokes, but he could not 
move. Nor speak. 

4CT beg your forgiveness. Father.” 

X The stranger’s voice shaded 
into pleading. “You see, we are a 



very old race. We had had our 
civilizations grow up and destroyed 
before there was even a single cell 
on this planet. We too rose high up 
from the etarly beginning and sev- 
eral times nearly succeeded in com- 
pletely annihilating ourselves. How- 
ever, that was a long time ago. 

“It was also a long time ago 
when the race suddenly discovered 
the reason — or at least, a reason 
— for our existence. We are dedi- 
cated to saving races from com- 
mitting suicide — of helping them 
to find God.” 

The alien turned in his seat to 
face the father, his dark shadow 
separating from the wall, and now 
there was pain in his voice. 

“We created a science with which 
we can correlate all the factors of 
a civilization, and we can, with a 
dreadful certainy, predict its future. 
We have done it millions of times, 
because we are an old race, and 
there are unimaginable billions of 
living beings in the darkness of 
your back yard above your head. 
The prognosis for your race is 
death.” 

“You lie,” said Father Hume. 

“I don’t.” We try not to interfere, 
because of the dignity of the race. 
There are times, though, like now, 
when we must reveal ourselves, be- 
cause that is the only hope for 
saving the race.” 

“If what you say is true, why 
should you be talking to me in 
particular?” 

“Because you — many thousands 
like you — can alter the fate of 
this world.” 

“Me?” Father Hume laughed out

loud. “You know who I am? I am 
a country priest, tending about a 
thousand souls in an area so big 
that the mind reels, and before 1 
came here I was a country priest 
covering an area so small that it 
was nearly a joke. You know how 
old I am? I am nearly fifty-eight, 
and if the Lord so pleases, I shall 
live down here the rest of my nat- 
ural life. Just what qualifications 
do you have in mind for saving 
ihe world?” 

The evening was quiet. Its dark- 
ening majesty was only broken by 
tiny animal noises and the wedge 
of fear emanating from Father 
Hume, still sitting unmoving, the 
hard pattern of the cane pressing 
against his perspiration-softened skin. 

At McBain’s, in the pub, men 
would now be gathering for the 
evening drinking. The gigantic fan 
on the ceiling would be going round 
and round, swirling the cigarette 
smoke and the stale smell of beer. 
The faces burned hard, sown heav- 
ily with wrinkles, perspiration run- 
ning down in their years-old chan- 
nels. The voices would be high, 
bantering. It is Saturday night, not 
much different from the rest of 
them, except for the Sunday to 
follow. The talk would be about 
football, the bloody Chinks, and 
how about Vietnam? The same old 
risque jokes — I beg your pardon 
Father, but did you hear this one? 
— voluminous laughter, shrill from 
the partition where some of the 
women would be sitting, and he. 
Father Hume would stand on the 
edge of the crowd, hanging on to 
a glass of beer, because it was a 



different country, different cus- 
toms. (He had to be there in shirt 
sleeves to make sure they saw his 
face. And next day, reluctantly, 
they woidd be turning up in the 
tiny church, their minds already on 
the chores the day after that, think- 
ing Hume is all right, but wish to 
Heaven he’d hurry a little. I’ll have 
to wash the car, or water the gar- 
den, or lay a bet, or play two-up, 
if only the bloody woman wouldn’t 
insist on spoiling the best part of 
the day. 

T he alien stood up and looked 
up in the sky. His thin, tall 
figure looked like a pain-filled, 
burned-out tree from a Russell Drys- 
dale painting. When he looked down 
and spoke again, his voice was slow, 
and in it, pain. 

“I told you I haven’t time; Fath- 
er. Well, my time has arrived. When 
we reached this world, we studied 
it most carefully for a long time 
and realized one tragic point. You 
people were conditioned into be- 
lieving not so much in the power 
and glory of reasoning, but in blind, 
almost insane emotional persuasion. 
You even have a saying for it: ‘it’s 
worth dying for.’ Almost all your 
deities had to do that before you 
began to believe. So we have de- 
cided to die. There were many of 
us in the ship we came in, and no 
one will go back. At this moment 
there are over a thousand of us 
standing in front of people like you. 
We stand in front of Lamas and 
Rabbis, Imams and Besharabs, 
Christian priests and Shamans; 
some of us stand in the burning sun. 



114 



IF 




some in the dark, but we all do 
exactly the same thing: we beg 
of you to save the race. For this 
we are willing to die. 

“When our ship explodes, we 
will all die for you. For you all.” 

Somewhere, up in the immensity 
of space above, stars were blanketed 
out by a spreading globule of eye- 
hurting brightness. There was no 
noise, only the swiftly growing lum- 
inosity. 

Father Hume’s heart hammered 
in his chest, physical fear knotting 
his muscles, his lips opening and 
closing, opening and closing, no 
voice, his lips opening and closing, 
his eyes focusing with dread ‘on the 
figure only a few yards away. 

Flames, yards high, were stand- 
ing there, and in the core, for sec- 



onds the pain-twisted features of a 
man. Then the tall figure fell to 
the ground, the hungry flames con- 
suming it as if it were magnesium. 
Father Hume stared until it was 
over. Even in the darkness, he could 
see a few bones left. 

He nearly fell on his face, as 
he stumbled over the raised edge 
of the verandah. Where the alien 
had stood, the ground was still hot, 
and in a few of the bones the mar- 
row was gently boiling. 

It was then that Father Hume 
staggered back to the verandah and, 
supporting himself on the lean-on 
pole, was sick. His tears were flood- 
ing his face, with that unearthly 
core of explosion still hi^ in space. 

The new star to a new Bethlehem.

EVIL ONES

Illustrated by BODE 



The aliens chose their first contact 
with Earth at random. Did it really 
matter that it was a lunatic asylum? 



I ingly in a muted bass, waver in its 

course, then nose down sharply. 

I t had come out of the sky one Tlie sounds weren’t loud and every- 
night, trailing a pink-white blow- body else in the home seemed to be 
torch blast behind it, and crash- asleep. Hengsen, gripping the bars 
landed with a whump like a distant of his second-story window, knew 

bomb burst in the field on the immediately that it was no plane, 

far side of the supply shed. After a while an opening appeared 

Hengsen had seen the ship loom in the side of the disabled ship, 
up from the south, rumble protest- Hengsen could see light inside, and 



116 






then shapes appeared and framed 
themselves against it. Two of them 
came out. He couldn’t tell what 
they were, exactly, but they weren’t 
men. 

They came on, up the slight rise, 
toward the home, in a steady gliding 
motion. The shed hid them from 
his sight for a moment and when 
they reappeared around it he could 
see better. There was starlight and 



prison for the criminally insane and, 
after a while, when the right 
amounts of money had been spread 
around in the right places, he’d 
been transferred to a private rest 
home. He’d been there a month. He 
didn’t plan to be there another; be- 
fore then he’d have the lay of the 
land, and he’d make the break. 

Those characters from the ship, 
though. What was their racket? 



a sliver of moon. He was glad it was 
only a sliver. Had the moon been 
full, all the nuts in the place would 
have been up and yapping. 

Hengsen himself was no nut. He 
was in a nuthouse all right, but 
anything was better than the electric 
chair or life in the state penitentiary. 
Hengsen had killed a man, but he’d 
had a good lawyer who’d pleaded in- 
sanity. So they’d sent him to a 



They’d better not screw up his plans. 
He laughed a little at that, nervously, 
and the things from the ship stopped 
dead. They must have better ears 
than a cat. 

They looked up, straight at him, 
and he got a good view of them. 

They had heads that sat right on 
top of their big round bodies — no 
necks. They had a thick single leg 
each, ending in a kind of ball on 



THE EVIL ONES 



117 




which they were balancing now, 
leaning toward each other and con- 
sulting. 

Hengsen couldn’t see their faces 
clearly, but he had the feeling their 
eyes were boring into his. He found 
out soon enough that they didn’t 
have eyes — not like people’s eyes. 

H engsen stood up on a stool as 
they approached the back of 
the home, but the bars were in the 
way, and he lost sight of them as 
th^ reached the back door. 

Hengsen looked back across the 
field and saw that the door of the 
ship was shut now. The craft lay 
there, a motionless black hulk. 

He heard the back door open, 
though it should have been locked, 
and there was a moment of silence. 
Then there was noise on the stairs, 
as if they were having trouble navi- 
gating them with their ball-bearing 
feet. But soon the noise indicated 
that they had reached the top of 
the stairs, and there was silence 
again. Then his door opened. He 
knew that had 'been locked. 

The two of them glided in, each 
of them pointing one of its three 
arms at Hengsen, and the door closed 
behind them. 

Hengsen had rarely been scared 
in his fifty years but he was now. 
He stepped down slowly off the 
stool, Ids legs quivering, and stood 
by the barred window. His visitors 
w»e absolutely motionless, poised 
side by side, arms extended toward 
him as if in accusation. The eyes, 
three of them arranged in a triangle 
on each face, were protruding 
knobs of membrane with purple 



veins criss-crossing them. The heads 
and bodies were a dull gray white, 
as if they’d never known sun. 
Gray4)lack hair began at the lower 
parts of the bodies and grew down 
as far as the ball feet, ^dh were 
bone Vhite. 

Hengsen tried to think of some- 
thing to say to the things. They 
didn’t seem to want to open a con- 
versation, and he didn’t want to 
open it the wrong way. He didn’t 
know what the outthrust arms could 
do to him, but he imagined it would 
be better not to find out. 

“HeUo,” he said finally. “What 
can I do for you?” 

There was no reply. Just a slight 
oscillating of the six eyes. 

“Welcome to Shady Rest,” he 
said. He tried to say it sardonically, 
but he didn’t smile. And he curbed 
a nervous temptation to laugh. 

His legs were still trembling. Care- 
fully, slowly, he sat in the stool. 
As slowly, the things lowered their 
arms. They also turned their heads 
slightly to look at each other while 
continuing to regard him with their 
veined membranes. 

Then they whirled and were out 
the door. The door closed. He rush- 
ed to it. It was locked, as before. 

I t was daylight when he awoke. 

He remembered lying on his cot, 
after he’d tired of looking out at 
the silent diip, and he remembered 
half fearing, half hoping diat the 
two creatures would come back to 
his room. They hadn’t, and at last 
he’d relaxed. 

He awoke with the opening of 
his door, and he sat up so fast he

got dizzy; but it was only the 
keeper, Hank. 

“Mrs. Balch wants to see you,” 
he said. 

“Okay, Hank,” Hengsen said. 

“How come you slept with your 
clothes on?” 

Hengsen put his feet on the floor 
and went to the window. The ship 
was still there. The door was closed. 

“I saw them,” he said. “Did 
you?” 

“Yeah,” said Hank. “They don’t 
scare me, whatever they are, but 
Mrs. Balch is in a tizzy. They cut 
the telephone wires, or burned them 
out. Minnie let out a yip and fell 
over in a dead faint when she seen 
them and Cook, he won’t set foot 
out of the kitchen.” Minnie was the 
maid of all work. Cook was close 
to seventy. 

“Is that why Mrs. Balch wants 
to see me?” Hengsen asked. 

Hank shrugged. “I dunno why. 
She said to get you down there, so 
let's get. I ain’t got all day.” 

“Okay. I’m coming.” 

“Walk ahead of me and don’t try 
no funny stuff,” the keeper warned 
him. “Remember I’m a karate ex- 
pert, and I could hurt you bad.” 

Hengsen smiled. He knew that the 
hulking, near moronic Hank had 
taken his karate course by corres- 
pondence. But he also knew that 
Hank was strong as an ox and 
could hurt him just by pushing him 
around. 

They went down the stairs and 
into the lobby. Mrs. Balch was a 
tall, beefy woman in the prime of 
her forties. She wore a severe tweed 
suit with a no-nonsense blouse, effi- 



cient low-heeled shoes and service- 
weight nylons. There had been a 
Mr. Balch once, but he’d given up 
the ghost long ago. The widow Balch, 
now the sole proprietor, ran Shady 
Rest practically single-handed. She 
completely dominated Hank, Min- 
nie and Cook, who were her entire 
staff. 

But she wasn’t dominating anyone 
this morning. She was sitting at her 
desk in the corner of the lobby, 
the beings from the ship standing 
on either side of her. Minnie was 
lying on a sofa, apparently still un- 
conscious with a damp cloth on her 
forehead. If Cook was in the kitchen 
he wasn’t advertising it with his 
usual prebreakfast clatter. 

“Ah, Mr. Hengsen,” Mrs. Balch 
said brightly as he and Hank came 
in. She wore an unaccustomed smile 
on her frown-lined face. 

“Good morning, Mrs. Balch,” 
Hengsen replied, playing along With 
it, whatever it was. She’d never 
called him mister before, though she 
was collecting plenty for his board. 

“These gentlemen,” she said, in- 
dicating the creatures from the ship, 
“have paid an unexpected call. They 
have had — what shall we say — 
engine trouble, and will be staying 
with us while they make repairs. 
They are traveling incognito, so 
to speak, and desire privacy. I’ve 
assured them that they can’t do bet- 
ter than to stay here at Shady Rest.” 

The veined eye membranes of 
the creatures had flicked from her 
to Hengsen as she spoke. 

“I see,” said Hengsen. “And I’m 
supposed to cooperate? Maybe they’d 
like me to go into town and get

them same magazines or cold beer?** 
The creatures stirred ominously, 
levity, please,** Mrs. Bidoh 
said quickly. **Ilhere must be no 
oemmunioation with the outside 
werid beyond what is absolutely 
necessary. We have disconnected the 
telephone. The mail will be delivered 
and collected at the box on the 
read, as usual. And I personally will 
supervise deliveries from the mar- 
ket.** 

“You’d better do something about 
the ship,” Hengsen said. “The deliv- 
ery men could see it, and it’d sure as 
hell be spotted by a plane flying 
over.” 

“Yes, they thought of that. So I’m 
going to ask you and Hank to go 
out and — well — disguise it in 
some way. Do you know anything 
about camouflage, Mr. Hengsen?” 
“As a matter of fact, I do, a 
little,” he said. “I could do it with 
soflse paint and canvas and shovels. 
But why should I beat my brains 
out for them?” 

T here was a sound of footsteps 
in the corridor. An elderly man 
in pajamas appeared, slip-slopping 
along in bacMess slippers. He was 
talking to himself and gesturing 
elaborately. Hengsen recognized him 
as one of Mrs. Balch’s long-term 
guests whose delusion was that he 
was twins. His name was Jimmy- 
joha. Jimmy for one of the twins, 
-john for the other. 

“Breakfast is a little late this 
year,” Jimmy was saying to -john. 

“Better late than oatmeal,** -John 
replied in a higher voice. “Never 
could stand oatmeal.*’ 



“Jimmy-john stopped and looked 
around hiim as he reached the lob- 
by. “Good morning, my dear Mrs. 
Balch,** said Jimmy’s voice. 

‘TIell,** said -join’s voice, short- 
ly. Jimmy was fond of her, but -john 
neither liked nor trusted her. She 
was always trying to feed him oat- 
meal, and everyone knew oatmeal 
was one of the easiest foods to 
poison. 

The three-eyed visitors regarded 
the pajama-clad man warily. The 
nearer one half-lifted an arm. The 
farther one did the same, but direct- 
ed it toward the sofa, where Minnie 
was coming to. The maid opened 
her eyes, sat up, saw the creatures 
again, gasped, pushed herself as far 
back against the arm of the sofa 
as sihe could and sat there, trembling. 

“Good morning, Jimmy-john,” 
Mrs. Balch said. “You boys shouldn’t 
really be out of your room, you 
know.” 

“We were hungry,” Jimmy said 
nonchalantly. 

“Who are they?” -john asked, 
pointing to the creatures as if notic- 
ing them for the first time. 

“New ones, I imagine,” Jimmy 
replied. “It’s nice here,” he said, 
addressing them, “if you don’t mind 
a late breakfast.” 

“Of oatmeal,” -john added. He 
warned them: “Beware the lowly oat, 
for in its meal lurk things un- 
known.” 

“I don’t think they’re men,” Jim- 
my said. 

“Or, to put it another way, I think 
they don’t think they're men. Look 
how peculiarly they’re dressed.” 

“A disguise,” -john said darkly.

“I think they’re spies from State 
Health. Admit it,” he said to the 
creatures. 

“Show us your puzzle blocks and 
your rubber hammers and whatever 
else you’ve got.” 

Minnie could take no more. She 
screamed hysterically and dashed 
from the sofa toward the door. As 
one, the creatures whirled toward 
her. Each raised an arm and point- 
ed it at her. There was a flash of 
blinding blue light, a crackle of 
sound and an acrid smell. Minnie 
stiffened and fell. There was no 
doubt in anyone’s mind that she 
was dead. 

The creatures seemed to be 
trembling. Their veined eyes pulsed, 
and their outstretched arms pointed 
indecisively^ to each of the others 
in the room before they lowered 
them to their sides. 

Hengsen felt a throbbing in his 
head and suddenly words were there 
which said: “No more of that, 
please.” 

He knew beyond a doubt that the 
words were those of the creatures 
and that they were a command he 
would obey. 

Jimmy-john took two steps back- 
wajds, so that he came out of his 
slippers. “I believe I’ll return to 
my room,” Jimmy said. 

“I'll go with you,” -john said. 
“It’s warmer there.” 

The elderly man turned around 
carefully and walked barefoot down 
the corridor. 

Hengsen said: “I’m ready to start 
on that camouflage job, Mrs. Balch, 
anytime these — gentlemen want 
me to.” 



U 

H engsen had had a not dishonor- 
able discharge, as he put it, 
from the army. He’d served re- 
luctantly but not without profit in 
areas which had included the black 
markets of the Pacific in World 
War II. He’d learned something 
about camouflage, and he did a 
passable job on the ship. From the 
supply shed it would look like a pile 
of junk. From the air, except to a 
trained observer looking for some- 
thing, or to a camera, it would have 
appeared as a pile of rocks in the 
field. 

Hank helped with the painting and 
the heavier work. All the time they 
were on the job the ship’s one en- 
trance remained shut. No one en- 
tered it or left it but obviously 
there were other creatures inside. 
Apparently the door to it was not 
sealed. They could hear muted fits 
of banging from inside, as if the 
repair work was being attempted 
with more temper than progress. 

“What do you figure these guys 
are?” Hank asked, as they sto<^ 
back to survey their finished job. 
“Russians?” 

Hengsen looked at him scornfully. 
“Russians are people,” he said. 
“These birds ain’t from any place 
on this Earth, bud.” 

The ship was wingless and shaped 
like a cucumber — bumpy the way 
a cucumber is and without any 
apparent opening except the door, 
a round cut in the side. 

“Okay,” said Hank. “But how 
come they’re here?” 

“I don’t know, but I have a hunch.

for what it’s worth. They didn’t 
plan to land here. By ‘here’ I’m 
not referreing to Mother Balch’s cozy 
Nook; I mean they didn’t intend to 
land on Earth at all. Their engine 
conked out, and they had to come 
down, that’s all. They’ll be on their 
way as soon as they get it fixed. So 
it’s simple. We play ball with them 
and do everything they say and 
get rid of them as soon as possi- 
ble.- 

“But where were they going in the 
first place?” Hank persisted. 

“/ don’t know, pal,” said Heng- 
sen. “Maybe from Pluto to Venus, 
or from Venus to Jupiter. From Nat- 
chez to Mobile, for ail I know. 
Maybe they’re taking it on die 
lam from the Space Patrol. I’m not 
a UJ^.O. expert. I’m just one of 
Mother Balch’s crazy pigeons. You’d 
get as good an answer from Jimmy- 
john. Why don’t you ask him?” 
‘^Because he’s a real nut,” Hank 
said. “Also because 1 don’t think 
you’re as much of a nut as you 
msd^e out. I read the papers, you 
know.” 

“So?” 

“So this, Mr. Wally Three-Gun 
Hengsen. I know you beat a murder 
rap that should of sent you to the 
chair. I know you had a smart law- 
yer, and that’s the only reason you’re 
here instead of in the death house 
right now. So don’t get smart with 
me, Wally-boy, or I might just turn 
you in for the fun of it.” 

Hengsen clenched his fists in the 
pockets of his work pants to help 
him control his tongue. 

“That's a lot of newspaper talk,” 
he said finally. “I’m surprised it

took you in — a smart guy like 
you. All I know is that for the 
record I was certified a nut, like 
the rest of the characters here, and 
here I am. I always thought you 
were my pal and that when I got out 
of this loony-bin I’d send for you. 
You’d make a good man in the or- 
ganization. I used to think before 
you started shooting off at the 
mouth.” 

“The organization?” 

“Yeah. My outfit likes a guy 
that can keep his yap shut. A real 
big-money outfit.” 

“I can keep my yap shut. You 
don’t have to worry about me, not 
if you’re level.” 

“I’ve always leveled with you, 
kid, so I’ll tell you. Just between 
you and me and the Space Patrol, 
I’m waiting for the break. And 
when it comes. I’ll be on my way. 
And any help 1 get I’ll be ^ad of 
and pay for. So, if you happen to 
be the guy that helps me, there’ll 
be a place in the organization for 
you. Is that straight enough?” 
“Straight as an arrow,” Hank 
said. “Say, you want to take it on 
the lam now? You could get away 
clean and easy, and nobody’d see.” 
“Thanks, but I’m not ready. I 
need cash and transportation and 
the right contacts.” 

“I got fifty bucks I could let you 
have,” Hank said. Hengsen knew 
then that the keeper was his man. 

“I can see you’re real organiza- 
tion material,” Hengsen said. “But 
no, thanks. I need real money and 
rn wait for the right time. Right 
now I’m holing up, like your three- 
eyed Russians.” 



“1 was only kidding about them 
being Russians. I guess maybe they’re 
Martians.” 

“Whatever they are, we’d better 
get back to the house and see if 
they put the arm on anybody else 
besides poor old Minnie.” 

M rs. Balch was as close to tears 
as her dignity would permit. 
“Those horrible thingsV* she said, 
kneading her hands. “Why did they 
have to come here, of all places? 
Poor Minnie! At least she’s out of it. 
And poor Cook. He’s in such a state 
I don’t think we’ll ever get lunch, 
let alone breakfast.” 

Minnie’s body still lay on the 
sofa in the lobby. Someone had 
covered it with a blanket. 

“Where are they, Mrs. Balch?” 
Hengsen asked. 

They went up to the cupola a 
little while ago. They’re looking out 
— Lord knows at what. They had 
their eyes on me every minute when 
I went for die mail. What are we 
going to do with them?” 

“Or vice versa,” Hengsen said. 

“I won’t even think about that. 
Will you and Hank take Minnie 
somewhere, please? I do hope they 
go soon enough for us to call some- 
body before . you know ... I 
mean in time.** 

“I suppose they had their eye 
on us all the while we were camou- 
flaging the ship,” Hank said to 
Hengsen, “so that if you’d tried to 
make — ” 

“Tried to go for the police,” 
Hengsen put in quickly; “ — if 
either of us had tried to go for help 
they’d have rayed us down, or what- 



THE EVIL ONES

ever it is they do with those arms 
©f theirs.” He shot a warning look 
at Hank. 

“Oh, they're evil,” said Mrs. 
Balch. “They think at you, and you 
can understand what thejr want you 
to do. They phrase it so politely, 
but you know you have to obey. You 
have the feeling that back of their 
commands lie terrible things. Did 
you get that impression?” 

“Nah,” Hank said. 

“Yes,” Hengsen said. “I know 
what you mean, Mrs. Balch.” 

Hengsen and Hank put Minnie’s 
body in the cellar^ which was cool 
for the time being. They sat on 
crates near the corpse and rested. 
Hengsen smoked a cigarette and 
sought an angle. There were plenty 
of weird angles to the situation, but 
there had to be one that was right 
for him. 

There should be opportunity 
here, if he could only work it out. 
But there was also deadly danger, a 
quicker exit than the electric chair, 
if he muffed it. These three-armed 
boys didn’t fool around. 

Probably he could get away, with 
Mrs. Balch distracted the way she 
was and Hank willing to cooperate. 
He didn’t have to wait for his con- 
tacts to spring him from the rest 
home. He knew where to find them. 
But these aliens, whatever they were, 
ought to be useful to him in some 
way, if only he could figure it out. 

The way they communicated, for 
instance. If he could learn to do 
that there’d be a fortune in it. It 
was like radio was to jungle drums 
or smoke signals. What a help it 
would be on a job if your lookout 



man could think right to you. And 
if it worked two ways, so he could 
read other people’s minds, how 
about that? He could clean up in 
the stock market, or at a crooked 
prize fight. He could even go straight. 
Just sit back and listen to the deals 
being made, then cut himself in. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Hank 
said. “Minnie gives me the creeps.” 
“Shut up. I’m thinking.” 

“Let’s go, Hengsen,” Hank said. 
“Go on upstairs. I won’t run 
away.” 

Hank shuffled his feet, then got 
up. “Okay. But I’ll be at the top 
of the stairs, so you better not try 
anything.” 

“Who are you working for? Balch 
or me? Go on, beat it.” 

“Yeah, I forgot. Okay, but I’ll 
be up there anyway. We got to 
make it look right.” 

“That’s the smart boy.” 

Their ship now, Hengsen thought. 
Was there anything there? Suppose 
he found a way to knock off the 
aliens. He’d have their ship. But 
it wouldn’t do him any good unless 
he could drive it. And if he waited 
till they fixed it, they'd be gone. 
That angle looked like a dead end. 
If he knocked them off, the local 
cops or the state troopers, or some- 
body, would come in and take the 
credit. 

There was no justice. 

He wasn’t getting anywhere. He 
needed more information, and he 
wasn’t going to get that sitting in 
the cellar. He ground out his ciga- 
rette and got up. The thing to do 
was to go see the creatures. Up in 
the cupola. 



124 



IF 





m 

O n the way up he tried to put him- 
self in the proper frame of 
mind. Submerging his motives, he 
concentrated on thinking friendly, 
respectful thoughts. It wouldn’t hurt 
to seem a bit stupid as well. 

He didn’t see Mrs. Balch. Hank, 
Who had been standing in the hall, 
followed him up the sairs to the 
third floor. 

“That’s far enough,” Hengsen told 
him. “I’ll be up there, with them. 
I ain’t going to fly away.” 

“Okay,” Hank said. “I’ll wait 
here.” 

Hengsen climbed the rest of the 
way. The door to the cupola was 
closed. There was silence behind 
it, but Hengsen knew they were there. 
And he knew they knew where he 



was. He took a deep breath and 
knocked. 

The door opened. Neither of them 
was near it. They were at the win- 
dow overlooking the camouflaged 
ship, balancing on their ball feet. 
Their arms, thank God, were at 
their sides. 

There was a throbbing in his head, 
and words formed in his mind: 

“Come in, Wally Hengsen.” 

He hesitated. I must be crazy, he 
thought. I can’t fool around with 
these boys. They’re Major League, 
and I’m only Triple-A. 

“Exactly, Wallace.” The words 
in his mind again. Wallace. Nobody 
had called him that since grade 
school. 

He stepped inside, not really 
wanting to, and the door closed 
behind him. Now he’d done it. He 




felt like turning and beating at the 
door, knowing it was locked, and 
yelling for Hank to let him out. 
But he forced himself to stand still, 
controlling the shakes that threat- 
ened behind his knees. 

“Sit down, Wallace. There is noth- 
ing to fear.” 

Nothing to fear? He thought of 
Minnie. Harmless Minnie. They’d 
mowed her down for nothing. For 
laughing. 

“We apologize for that.” The un- 
spoken words. “We did not know 
you then as we know you now.” 

There was a captain’s chair next to 
a table with a world globe on it. 
Hengsen sat down carefully, moving 
slowly. His knees were quivering 
now. He pressed his heels against 
the floor to stop the shakes. 

“You are here to know us bet- 
ter. That is good.” That wordless 
communication again. Which of the 
two was it? Their three-eyed faces, 
immobile told him nothing. 

“I want to help you,” Hengsen 
found himself saying. 

“You have already helped us, 
Wallace. You were expert in camou- 
flaging the craft.” 

“Thank you.” The humility came 
unnaturally to Hengsen. He twirled 
the globe on the table. It was dusty, 
and it squeaked. 

“A speck, your Earth. Ordinarily 
we would have ignored it, as we 
always have. But we are thank- 
ful, this time, that it exists.” 

“Why?” Hengsen lifted his thumb 
and found Australia underneath. It 
seemed tiny. 

“You could not understand. You 
are merely Triple-A. You need know 



only that we will leave you when 
we can. Necessity detains us, not 
ambition.” 

The word “ambition” stirred 
Hengsen. Thoughts flashed through 
his mind too fast to be controlled. 
He felt discovered. He tried, too 
late, to mask his thoughts, twirling 
the globe. 

There was no change of ex- 
pression in the veined eyes of the 
creatures. But the unspoken words 
came: 

“You have ambition. Earthling.” 
Earthling; not Wallace this time. 

He could deny it only with his 
mouth, so he did not try. They had 
rebuked him by calling him Earth- 
ling. 

“You would trick us if you could,” 
the thought came, more aware than 
accusing. 

Wallace (“Wally”) Hengsen 
looked at the spot on the globe that 
was New Caledonia, trying not to 
think, or to think innocuously. 
French-speaking isle, he told him- 
self. Subtropical. Down where the 
trade winds blow. World War II. 
Guadalcanal. The Slots. Rabaul. 
Mosquitos. P-51’s. The Rising Sun. 
The setting sun. Meatballs on the 
enemy fuselages. Kamikaze. B-29’s. 
Hiroshima. V-J. 

His not-thought, his recollections 
of the war he had been unable to 
avoid, were vivid. In their intensity 
they blanked out any antialien 
schemings. He felt the aliens absorb- 
ing the reality of his remembrance, 
asquainting themselves with that 
past of the Earthling and his Earth. 

It had been a long time since he 
had thought back. 



126 



IF 




H e'd had no reason to, before 
now. His thoughts had always 
been of Number One, in the long 
years following his discharge. But 
back then there had been more than 
himself. Even he had felt it, cynical 
punk that he’d been. A working 
together. A common cause he’d al- 
most forgotten. 

“We see you more clearly, 
Wallace.” Wallace again, not Earth- 
ling. “You are more complicated 
than we believed.” 

That wasn’t very original. One 
of the alienists who testified that he 
was legally insane had said much 
the same thing. The thought struck 
him that these three-eyed, three- 
armed, ball-footed creatures picking 
his brains were also alienists. Alien 
alienists. 

If his subconscious irony reached 
them they hadn’t reacted to it. He 
felt them probing the involuhtary 
memory that went along with his 
recollection of the alienists and the 
killing that had preceded it. The 
professional unemotional murder of 
the youth (much like the punk he 
once had 'been) who had to he pre- 
vented from singing to the D.A. 

He felt them accompanying him 
as he relived the stalk through the 
streets, in and out of bars, parks 
and finally the confrontation in the 
vacant lot, the pulling of the trig- 
ger of the automatic with the muz- 
zle pressed into the shrinking flesh 
of the punk, the flight in the trail- 
ing car, the sirens in the distance, 
the hole-up across the river and 
the waiting for the hunt to die down. 

“Go on.” The alien thought en- 
couraged him to continue. 



But when he emerged, roaring 
back across the long, high bridge to 
the city, he found that the hunt had 
not died. His information had been 
wrong, and they had nabbed him, 
grilled him, produced witnesses ('^dio 
could know what eyes had spied 
from the empty-seeming windows), 
tried him and sentenced him to the 
chair. Only the appeal, the feigned 
symptoms, the tamperable machinery 
of the law had saved him, whisking 
him from penitentiary to the prison 
for the insane to Shady Rest, Mrs. 
Balch’s domain. 

Now he was being tried again, by 
these creatures whose interest in him 
was ephemeral, who were marooned 
here temporarily on their way foom 
the unknowable to the unknown. 
But what he had hidden from the 
alienists was on open page to the 
aliens. How would they judge him? 
There could be no appeal from their 
verdict. 

The creatures had not stirred since 
he first entered the room. He might 
have been imagining everything. But 
he knew it was not imagination that 
held him submissive in the captain’s 
chair, awaiting their pleasure .... 
their need .... 

Their judgment. 

IV 

H engsen spun the globe idly and 
stopped it. The South Pacific 
again. He found the spit of land 
that was Sansapor, the northwest 
coast of New Guinea. There’d been 
an airstrip there. He’d been shipped 
there from the repple depple at Nou- 
mea with a buddy. 



THE EVIL ONES 



127 




His buddy, Murray Stein. Murray 
was a tou^ punk from Philadel- 
phia, but he wore a Star of David 
on the chain with his dogtags. He 
blackmarketed and goldbricked, but 
he sent his poker winnings home 
to his widowed mother. He had a 
foul mouth and world cynicism, but 
if there was no one else to do it 
he led the squadron’s tiny Jewish 
congregation in Friday night prayers. 

And when that stupid crew chief 
got into the parked P-51 and acci- 
dentally triggered the cannons, it 
was Murray Stein who yelled “Get 
down!” and threw himself against 
the slower Hengsen so that they both 
sprawled on the coral floor of the 
ready hut. But only Hengsen got 
up. If Stein had acted alone he’d 
have been safe. In saving Hengsen, 
Stein caught a 50-caliber slug in 
the back that tore out his heart. 

Hengsen helped dig the grave, and 
he swore as the burial service was 
read that some day, somehow, he’d 
repay Stein’s selflessness. He’d for- 
gotten that oath, until now. 

He sat in solmn silence, remem- 
bering. He had spoken not a word, 
and the three-eyed aliens were mute, 
as always. But they seemed less 
hostile. Then they reciprocated. They 
let him see into their own souls, 
or whatever aliens had. 

Briefly they lifted the curtain of 
their mystery, but it was long enough 
for him to sense the magnitude of 
their mission. He could understand 
what they had done so unfeelingly 
to Minnie. It had not been malice 
which had killed her. To them, 
when they had first come, the Earth 
people had been no more than an- 



noyances in their bigger plan, to be 
swatted as mosquitos if they got in 
the way. 

With his glimpse into their 
thoughts, Hengsen could appreciate 
the overwhelming desperation of 
their voyage. It was clear to Hengsen 
that their journay was an epic one, 
on which their entire civilization, 
their very future, depended. They 
were the scouts, the advance party, 
the only possible salvation of their 
people. If they failed, their people 
died. With such an alternative, who 
could blame them for their seemingly 
callous disregard of a life or two 
on an alien, third-rate planet? It 
was as if Hengsen, fleeing for his 
life from an enemy shooting at him, 
should break stride to avoid crush- 
ing an ant. 

Now he could believe that the 
impassivity of their faces masked 
an anxiety that the repairs by their 
fellow creatures in the ship should 
be finished quickly, so they could 
leave this way station and get on 
with their all-consuming mission. 
So they could leave this puny world 
they had been forced to land on 
and resume their quest for the des- 
tined land which would support their 
fellows — their buddies back home 
whose lives depended on them. 

Like Stein, they were selfless, 
risking their lives that others might 
live. Three eyes or two, ball-footed 
or arched, men were men. 

They sat in silence, the three of 
them, waiting for the turn of events 
that would free them to go on with 
their lives, to meet their differing 
destinies, whatever they were. 

And then the cops came, their ar- 



128 



IF 




rival heralded by the whooping wails 
of sirens in the distance. 



T he aliens rolled to the door and 
out, Hengsen commanded to 
follow, and down the stairs. Out to 
the yard, past the startled Hank and 
the fleeing Cook and the retreating 
Jimmy-john and the satisfied-look- 
ing Mrs. Balch, the aliens not paus- 
ing in their ball-footed flight, as they 
could have done, to ray down the 
betrayer, whoever he was. And across 
the yard and through the field past 
the shed to the camouflaged ship, 
Hengsen following less swiftly, run- 
ning, not sure why he was accom- 
panying them. 

But why were the aliens fleeing? 
Hengsen seemed to hear the an- 
swer before the question was asked. 
Duty, he half-heard. Your police 
have their duty, we have ours. 

We regret Minnie. We could dis- 
pose of them easily but we won’t 
kill another of you if we can help it. 
all this he seemed to hear. 

Running, stumbling, Hengsen saw 
the younger Hank gaining on him 
and throwing him the rifle. 

This must be the greatest thing 
that ever happened to Hank, Heng- 
sen thought. What a nut. He caught 
the rifle by its barrel as the police 
cars skidded into the driveway and 
their doors sprang open, uniformed 
men pouring out, shooting. Shoot- 
ing wildly at first, then dropping 
and taking aim. 

Hengsen, running zigzag out of 
a generation-old memory of combat, 
fell behind the aliens, who headed 
straight for the camouflaged ship. 
The circular door of the space- 




THE EVIL ONES 



129 



ship opened, and the aliens were 
inside it. Instead of clamping shut, 
the door remained open, a scant 
thirty yards away, and Hengsen 
heard the wordless alien voices. They 
seemed to be saying Our door is 
open to you. Come with us. 

But a fusillade of shots had him 
pinned down. 

“Come and get me!” he yelled, 
and they started to, fanning out on 
the flanks so he had to turn to 
fire at them at separate wide angles. 

B ut he wasn’t shooting to kill, 
although they were. He was 
shooting only to hold them at bay 
until his friends — his friends? — 
yes, his only friends in thirty years 
— could close their door (paying 
his debt to Stein) and be off. 

Then one of his wild shots, un- 
aimed, caught a cop and doubled 
him up; and Hengsen knew he had 
killed him. So now it was over. He 
could expect no mercy. The police 
bullets, once divided between him 
and the ship, concentrated on him. 
It was only fair, he thought. 

What was a poor, worn-out hood 
worth compared to the mission of a 
race beyond the stars? Who needs 
you, you sad remnant of a decayed 
civilization? You’ve got nobody. 
They’ve got everybody, ugly and 
alien as they may seem to people 
who don’t know them. But he knew 
them, finally, as he had almost 
known Stein, his one other friend. 

And then a cop he hadn’t seen, 
off to his right, snapped a shot at 
him and got him in the stomach. 

The door of the spaceship closed 
then, though he didn’t see it, and 



there was a confused medley of 
voices and thoughts; police coming 
up warily, talking to each other 
(Mrs. Balch had left a note in the 
mailbox); this is the guy the A.P.B. 
was out on; imagine him holed up 
on a funny farm; would you call 
that a U.F.O.? Anybody got a 
camera? Life and Time and the 
television are going to ask questions. 

It was better this way. The elec- 
tric chair would have got him any- 
way, for killing the cop. So he’d die, 
which had been his fate ever since 
V-J Day, if not happy, then content. 

“The rat ain’t going to live,” a 
cop’s voice said, intermingled with 
that of a voice from within the 
slowly rising spaceship which said 
in alien tones: Thank you, Earthman, 
Thank you, Earthman (not Earth- 
ling, but brother, buddy) for your 
fidelity to our fragile bond; our 
civilization thanks you. 

Maybe they could have escaped 
without his help. Maybe not. But 
they wanted him, and that was what 
had mattered. 

To have been needed was one 
thing. To have been wanted — in- 
vited — was another. He was glad, 
somehow, that he was dying here 
and now. He had done more than he 
needed to have done. Probably that 
had been its appeal. 

In his final living moment, as a 
lieutenant pulled out his notebook, 
and Mrs. Balch came out hesitantly, 
as the spaceship lifted majestically 
and hovered as if in salute before 
zooming skyward, he thought that 
to have paid the ordinary penalty 
would have been too — too what? 
Too mundane, maybe. END

THE DANGERS 
OF DEEPSPACE 

by MATHER H. WALKER 



He wanted to roam the starlanes. 
Nothing in the galaxy could keep 
him from it — except the truth! 



T ie man seated at the desk tap- 
ped his pencil thoughtfully 
against the application form. He 
looked critically at the kid seated 
before him. 

“Look,” he said sternly. “Just 
what m^es you think you’d like 
Deepspace work?” 

The kid was caught off guard. 
He started to move his mouth a 
couple of times without making any 
sound, like a fish out of water. Final- 
ly he stuttered, “I — I — I worked 
on a merchant ship the last summer 
before finishing school. I’d like to 
see more of what’s out there. That’s 
all.” 

“Yes, yes,” the man said impa- 
tiently. “I see from your form you 
had a couple of months on the 
Venusian Lines. Interplanet flights. 



You may as well understand right 
now . .” He stopped abruptly as 
the door opened and a tall man in 
the purple Deepspace uniform en- 
tered. The man held some papers 
in his right hand. To the kid his 
face appeared stern and hard, the 
face of a man accustomed to facing 
inconceivable dangers as a matter 
of mere routine. 

The face of the man seated at 
the desk brightened. “Hello, Larrer. 
Haven’t seen you in quite a while. 
How’s things going?” 

“Lost four men this last trip 
out,” the tall man said. “Damned 
thing on one of the Outworlds. The 
thing must have been as big as 
a mountain. Picked the scout craft 
right out of the air and ate it like 
it was a piece of candy with the 



131 




four men inside it. A nasty business. 
We could see it all from the main 
ship and hear them screaming, aU 
the time over the radio, hut there 
wasn’t a danm thing we could do 
about it. Christ,” the tall man said 
suddenly. “One of these days Fm 
going to get enough sense to quit 
this damn business. Sometimes Fd 
swear I could still hear those men 
screaming.” 

“It’s no job for someone like me, 
V ho’s used to sitting at a desk. That’s 
for sure,” the man at the desk said. 
“But someone has to do it. How 
about it? Are you ready to go out 
again?” 

The tall man shrugged his shoul- 
ders. “Have to make a living some 
way.” He handed the papers in his 
hand to the man at the desk. 

The man glanced at thfm, signed 
them, and handed them back. 
“There you are, Larrer. All clear.” 

‘Thanks, Colonel,” the tall man 
said. “See you in a few months, 
I hope.” He left with the spaceman’s 
quick, graceful stride. 

T he colonel turned back to the 
young man seated before him. 
“As I started to say, you may as 
well understand right now that there 
is no comparison between inter- 
planet flight and Deepspace travel. 
The human mind is helpless to grasp 
the immensity of Deepspace. There’s 
myriad upon myriads of suns, and 
you couldn’t even begin to number 
the planets. There’s creatures, be- 
ings, forms of life out there of 
every conceivable and inconceivable 
variety. Man is lost among it all.” 
The coloiiel looked sterply at the 



kid to impress him with the serious- 
ness of it all. 

The kid’s face was lit up like 
the face of a small child being told 
about Santa Claus. 

“Look,” the colonel said solemn- 
ly. “Deepspace work is a dangerous 
business. There are creatures out 
there — strange ^creatures, tremen- 
dous creatures that can smash in 
the side of a spaceship like an 
elephant would crush an egg.” The 
kid was practically on the edge of 
the chair now and hanging on to 
every word. 

The colonel rubbed his fingers 
across his eyelids and suddenly he 
was a tired old man. “Listen,” he 
said bluntly, “I know why you want 
to go to Deepspace. I knew before 
you asked me. It’s not the work. It’s 
the glamor that brings all you kids 
in here.” 

“But — ” the kid interrupted. 

“No buts,” the colonel said. “I 
just want you to understand my po- 
sition, that’s all. My job’s not easy. 
Every time I approve an application 
I may as well be signing a death 
warrant. There’s nothing really 
glamorous about Deepspace. It’s 
dangerous work, sure, but there’s 
no glamor to it. How would you 
like to have to face an alien life 
form no human being has even 
seen before? Some creatures so alien 
your mind can’t accept their exist- 
ence. So alien you’ll wake up scream- 
ing the rest of your life from hav- 
ing nightmares about it. In situa- 
tions such as those there are no 
rules to go by. You have to make 
up your own rules — and they bet- 
ter be right, or you end up just 



132 



IF 




another cold, dead body circling 
around a distant star. On top 
that there are situations whicth are 
not only dangerous but are down- 
right ri^culous. 

“Take that man who was just in 
here. A few years ago Larrer was 
seated before me just as you are 
now. Young and green, just like 
you, and brimming over with the 
glamor of going into Deepspace. 
Well, he made it, and you want to 
know what happened on his very 
first time out? One of the most 
ridiculous incidents in the history 
of Deepspace travel. They had set 
down on an asteroid way out in 
Deepspace when the radar sighted 
something which couldn’t have been 
there.” 

The kid looked as if he was 
about to fall off the edge of his 
chair. 

The colonel paused to light a 
cigarette. “Larrer was in the con- 
trol room, and he looked at the blip 
as it approached. 

“ ‘Captain, it’s not a meteor,* 
Brown, the radar man said. ‘It’s 
velocity isn’t constant.’ 

“ ‘Are you sure, Brown?’ the cap- 
tain asked. ‘Your radar must be on 
the blink. Ever3^ng has a constant 
velocity this far out in spacel’ 

“ ‘Positive, Captain, the radar’s 
okay. It’s changed its velocity again. 
It’s stiU too far away to use our 
mass as reference.’” 

T ie colonel observed the kid to 
see bow be was taking the story. 
He was 'breathing in short, quick 
breaths like a runner. “Well,” said 
the cplonel, “it couldn’t have hap- 



pened by the rulebook. But rules 
don’t apply in Deepspace. Larrer 
opened a porthole and looked off 
from the starboard of the ship. He 
saw something out in space. Sud- 
denly it was quite near and crystal 
clear as objects in space are. Lar- 
rer gaped at it. It was at least 
twenty times as long as the ship. 
It had a long wavering shape, and 
all over it were small, round spots 
that glowed and sparkled like gems 
before a bright flame. All the time 
the sonar emitted weird, burbling 
and gurgling noises. 

“Suddenly, unbidden, there came 
into Larrer’s mind the lines from 
Lewis Carroll’s poem Jabherwocky: 

Twas brillig and the slithy toves 
Did grey and gimble on the wabe 
All mimsy were the borogoves 
And the mome raths outgabe — 

“‘That’s what this thing is,’ Lar- 
rer thought. ‘A Jabherwocky.’ 

‘The others had sighted the thing 
now on the visi-screen. 

“ ‘By the great rings of Saturn!’ 

“ ‘It’s almost on top of usl’ 
“‘What in God’s name is it!’ 
“‘What’ll we do. Captain?’ 

“‘It’s too late to do anything,’ 
the captain said. ‘It’s too dose to 
us. If we used the atomic Master 
on it now we’d destroy the ship. 
We’ll just have to lay here and 
hope it goes away.’ 

“They stood watching as the 
strange thing came right on and on. 
The sonar continued to emit the 
weird burbling, gurgling sound. The 
thing stopped just short of the ship. 
“‘It’s examining the ship.’

“‘Good God, Captain, it’s going 
to sit down right on top of usi’ 

“And that seemed to be that. The 
thing dropped down right on top 
of the ship, and it stayed there. The 
men didn’t know what to make of it. 
“ ‘What’s the damn thing doing?* 
“ ‘Nothing. It’s just sitting there.* 
“‘What’ll we do. Captain?* 

“ ‘There’s nothing we can do,* 
said the Captain. ‘We have the laser 
beam, which wouldn’t kill it. At 
least not right away. And if that 
thing started threshing around it’d 
crush this ship like an egg. Does 
anyone have a theory as to why 
the thing just keeps sitting up there?* 
“By the third day the men on 
the siup had reached the conclusion 
that the thing was not going to go 
away. They had also almost gone 
out of their minds trying to figure 
out why it just kept sitting there. 
Then Dunned, the engineer, came 
rushing into the observation room. 

“ ‘Captain, I’ve been going 
through our Encyclopedia Galaotica 
microfilm. The thing’s listed. It was 
observed by the 5th Galactic Geo- 
graphy Survey Team. They call it 
the Scintillus. colossus. Listen to 
this: ‘Among other Deepspace crea- 
tures observed was the Scintillus 
colossus, so named because of its 
enormous size and because of the 
sparkling, gemlike appearance of 
the female of the species. The crea- 
ture emits electrical energies of 
varying frequencies which has the 
effect of producing a strange burb- 
ling sound from the ship’s sonar. 
From our limited survey of this 
creature, it was determined that the 
creature is oviparous and that it 



attains sizes exceeding two thousand 
feet in length.* 

4^ 6/^reat,’ the captain responded 
disgustedly. ‘Now we 
know someone else had seen the 
thing. But we still don’t know why 
the thing just keeps sitting on top 
of us like a hen sitting on an egg.* 
The captain did a double take. 
‘Let me see that note, Dunnerl 
“ ‘That*s it,* the captain said, 
looking at the paper Dunner had 
brought in. The thing’s oviparous. 
It lays eggs. Just how big do you 
think one of its eggs would be?* 
“‘Judging from its size, at least 
as big as this ship.’ Larrer said. He 
shot the captain a startled look. 
‘You don’t mean that thing thinks 
the ship’s an eggl* 

“‘Think about it a minute,* the 
captain said. 

“‘One of the men breathed a 
sigh of relief. ‘Well then, there’s 
nothing to worry about. We know 
the thing won’t harm the ship.* 
“‘Not so fast,’ the captain said. 
‘We have no idea how long the 
normd incubation period of one of 
its eggs is. The thing might sit up 
there for months. We have sup- 
plies only for four months. The trip 
back in takes three months.’’ 

“A week went by, and the situation 
was becoming desperate. Although 
everyone on the ship was racking 
his brains to come up with some 
idea to get that overgrown sitting 
hen off then, no one could come 
up with any practical suggestion. 
They seemed doomed to sit there 
either until they hatched or starved 
to death.”

“And that,” said the colonel, look- 
ing critically at the kid, “is Peep- 
space glamor in actual fact,” 

4^T)ut how did they get out?” 
JD “Oh, that,” the colonel said. 
“Well, Larrer was the one who made 
the suggestion, and he got a pro- 
motion out of it. They simply 
turned on all the heating units and 
got into their spacesuits for pro- 
tection. The surface of the ship 
kept gettting hotter and finally the 
ship got too hot for the thing up 
there to sit on. And of course, as 
soon as the thing rose up into 
space the ship took off.” 

The colonel chuckled. “I bet that 
thing is still puzzled about that egg. 
First it gets too hot to sit on, and 
then it goes shooting off into space.” 
The kid laughed too, and then 
the colonel was suddenly serious 
again. “Okay. I tell you what I’ll 
do. I’ll leave it up to you. If you 
still think you want Deepspace work, 
sign this paper, take it out to the 
front office, and you’re on your 
way.” 

The kid signed hastily. He took 
the paper and left hurriedly, afraid 
the coloned would change his mind. 

The kid was barely out of the 
office before the tall man came 
back in. “How’d you make out? Did 
you get the kid signed up?” 

“Hell, yeah!” the colonel said. 
“He signed it like he was afraid 
I’d change my mind.” 

“What technique did you use 
this time?” 

“The usual.” 

“Not that bit about another cold, 
dead body circling around a distant 



star?” the tall man said disgustedly. 
The colonel nodded. 

“And the ‘you’ll wake up scream- 
ing the rest of your life? stuff?” the 
tall man asked amazed. 

The Colonel nodded again. “I 
also told him the Jabberwocky 
story,” he said complacently. 
“Good God! Not the egg story!” 
“Swallowed it hook, line and sink- 
er,” the colonel said. “Hell, it’s not 
a bad story. In my opinion it’s a 
real classic. There’s some type of 
psychological appeal to it.” 

The tall man looked more dis- 
gusted than ever. “This is a heU of 
a racket. Colonel. Sometimes I get 
so disgusted I think I’d actually 
try a Deepspace voyage myself. 
Space is big enough, there’s no tell- 
ing what they might find out there.” 
“Sure, sure,” he said. “Only 
it so happens that in three hundred 
years about all they’ve found out 
there is some lichens. You didn’t 
know Brown did you?” 

“No,” the tall man said. 

“Well, he was in Deepspace work 
for thirty years. Then he found 
something alive on an asteroid out 
there somewhere. It was fust a little 
buglike thing no bigger than the tip 
of your finger, but he was as proud 
of it as if he had discovered one 
of those alien civilizations they write 
about. He carried the thing around 
with him for years in a little plastic 
bottle. Had it last time 1 saw him. 

“What do you suppose will hap- 
pen when the kid discovers there’s 
nothing out there but boredom?” 
the tall man asked. 

“Oh, he’ll get over it,” the colonel 
said. “We all do.” END

A BEACHHEAD 
FOR 
GREE 



by C. C. MacAPP 



Illustrated by BURNS 




The planet was only a battleground 
in Gree's war against Mankind . 
but the non-combatants had to die! 



X?gral was angry. His huge body 
was bunched on the low wide 
platform-stool like that of some 
oversized, overmuscled black Terran 
feline. The thick neck, almost a 
torso, that rose from a broad chest 
was erect and rigid; the third pair 
of limbs — stubby arms that 
sprouted midway up the neck — 
folded tensely. 



Steve Duke said firmly, “We bar- 
gained in good faith.” 

The Remm’s wide-set eyes glared. 
“What difference does that make? If 
I hadn’t bargained, we wouldn’t 
have led this Gree Empire to our 
very doorstep. The Task Force I 
was with would have stayed lost out 
in the Sparse Regions!” 

Steve tried not to look at the 
Remm’s fangs and claws. “There’s 
no certainty at all that we led them 



136 



here. This isn’t the first galaxy 
they’ve cx>nquered. Don’t you think 
they’d move in toward the Hub 
sooner or later?” 

“Sooner or later!” Egral’s short- 
muzzled face showed disgust. “Soon- 
er or later! How do / know what 
might have happened ten generations 
from now? It’s my tail — ” he waved 
that truncheon-like member for 
emphasis — “that’s in a crotch now. 
I had absolutely no right to bargain 
with you — I, a mere linguist — 
no right or qualification at all! You 
bamboozled me into it!” He shifted 
his weight jerkily. “The mildest thing 
I’ve been accused of is treason.” 

Steve muttered, “They’ll never ac- 
cuse you of being inarticulate.” 
Louder, he said, “Since you’ve con- 
demned me, tell me the details so I 
can brood over my crime. Have you 
actually seen Gree ships? Have you 
located their Base?” 

Egral snorted. “Seen them? There 
was a skirmish, and they were better 
prepared than we were. Two of our 
capital ships are lost in null. The 
ones that got home are damaged. 
We know the approximate location 
of the Base. We captured one small 
auxiliary, with navigation computers 
intact.” 

Steve sighed. “Your High Com- 
mand was warned that you can’t 
fight Gree with just capital ships.” 

Egral scowled. “We’re building 
escorts, somewhere. Naturally — 
now — I’m no longer privy to classi- 
fied information.” 

“Privy, eh?” Steve grunted. 
“You’ve really mastered English. Are 
you close enough to the privy to 
know if the Base is being scouted?” 



Egral, without looking any less 
angry, showed his fangs in a grin. 
“My superiors see no reason to risk 
a p^eotly good and loyal per- 
sonnel. I’m to accept your offer to 
volunteer. You and your two com- 
panions and I will go in the cap- 
tured ship. We won’t know the way 
back, in case we’re captured. We’ll 
have small message drones, but we 
won’t know to where they’re pro- 
grammed. If we survive initial con- 
tact, and if we send out adequate 
data, and if we can destroy the null 
terminal so Gree can’t send rein- 
forcements, my superiors may risk 
trying to pick us up instead of blast- 
ing the whole planet.” 

Steve digested that. “As easy as 
that, eh?” 

The Remm said, “I was sure 
you’d be delighted, and so am I. 
The Tribunal considering my case 
has been reading ancient history. 
Before we became over-civilized, 
we used some interesting forms of 
punishment.” 

T hrough the viewscape, the planet 
showed no sign of habitation. 
It was one of the discus-shaped 
worlds so common here, with a core 
of the dense matter Steve still 
couldn’t think of as normal, which 
showed a polarization of gravity 
along its axis of spin. From this 
angle the banding showed clearly: 
an iced pole, a dark brown tundra- 
zone, then a wide greenness stretch- 
ing to the equatorial clouds. 

Fazzool, the gray-hided B’lant, 
looked up from his instruments. “If 
I have ze physics right, gravity half- 
way between ze pole and ze equator

should be about zero point seven.” 
Steve said, “They’d put the Base 
in higher gravity if they had a choice, 
so personnel wouldn’t get soft. Do 
you still place it here?” 

“Zat is where ze only electro- 
magnetic spill comes from.” 

Steve glanced at Egral, who look- 
ed on, tail twitching. “Better get the 
backpacks ready.” Steve put the ship 
in a fall, and spoke hurriedly for 
his throat-mike. “Emergency! Em- 
ergency! Do you have a fix on us? 
We have only partial control! If 
you’ll set a landing-spot, we’ll try 
to — ”He pushed a computer-stud, 
and preprogrammed static drowned 
out his words. The ship bucked, the 
image of the planet whisking off- 
screen and back. Steve’s companions 
were shouting wildly in B’lant and 
English. Steve yelled over the din, 
“Our gravs — ” 

An Overseers’s voice came through 
harshly. “Identify yourself. Slave!” 
“J-Jen, sir; 377-03-50! We took 
heavy damage and I’m ranking sur- 
vivor! But I’m not — the con- 
trols — ” 

The voice snarled, “Stay in space, 
you fool! We’ll send up a rescue 
ship. Check your fall, or we’ll blast 
you!” 

Steve let the static roar again. He 
threw a glance at the others, then 
watched the viewers. A light blinked 
orange. A missile-launching. Orange 
lines grew toward the center of a 
scope. He put the ship in an erratic, 
jerking course; struggled out of his 
seat, hanging on with one hand as 
Egral slipped packstraps over the 
other shoulder. He let go long 
enough to shrug into the harness. 



then pulled himself to the controls. 
He yelled at Fazzool, “See any open 
spots?” 

The B’lant jabbed a gray finger 
at the screen. “Zat lake!” 

Steve punched studs; braced him- 
self. “Thirty seconds!” Air was 
shrieking around the hull now. The 
sound became deafening as the hatch 
shot open. Fazzool crouched in the 
opening, staring down. A blast rock- 
ed the ship as a missile went off near- 
by. Fazzool waited a few seconds, 
then jumped. Egral went next, his 
great form barely clearing the 
hatchedges. Steve, nerves screaming, 
shoved Earth-bom Ralph Parr 
through the hole, -then followed. The 
lake rushed toward him. His harness 
gray cut in gradually, so there was 
no jerk. He saw Egrd plunge in and 
braced himself for the impact. He 
hit and floundered for a moment, 
then swam desperately for the pale- 
green wall of trees, his pack weight- 
ing him down. He was almost 
stunned as another missile went off 
somewhere, followed by a rattling 
detonation as the ship blew up. He 
caught a glimpse of Egral slowly 
pulling ahead of him He blundered 
into something below water — a gi- 
ant tree-root — and pulled himself 
along it. 

The Remm was already standing 
hock-deep, a hand extended. Steve 
let himself be hauled out, stood 
gasping, then turned to look for the 
others. Fazzool, grinning as widely 
as his blunt, thick-skinned face could 
manage, waded in. Ralph Parr 
grounded a moment later, bent 
coughing up water, then slogged 
forward. Steve gestured toward a 



138 



IF 




fan of the enormous roots. “Out of 
sight!” 

There were no more explosions, 
and no whoosh of aircars within 
hearing. He’d timed it well; the ship 
had paused over the lake long enough 
for them to jump, then shot off to 
draw away missiles. There were 
Slave Warrior corpses enough in one 
compartment — preserved by the 
cold of space — to make the wreck- 
age convincing, he hoped. 

Energy-pistol in hand, he took 
time to look around. 

U 

T his was a swamp, choked with 
trees and undergrowth except 
for the open lake. It had a peculiar 
odor, besides the dankness — a 
sweetish one that reminded him of a 
hospital or laboratory. The trees were 
tremendous, but he couldn’t see 
much of them through the under- 
growth. That was mainly of one kind 
— ferns, he supposed you’d call 
them — with straight slender stems 
to a height of ten feet or so, then 
bursts of pale-green foliage that 
made him think of enormous ostrich 
plumes. 

He stepped out cautiously to see 
what they’d taken cover under. Some 
of the roots were as thick as a 
man. They fanned out from a great 
burl or tuber that must be a hundred 
feet across. From that buttress four 
monstrous treetrunks rose, the small- 
est of them twenty feet through at 
the base. Fifty feet up, the limbs 
began. 

They were striaght and hori- 
zontal, only long enough to brush 



those of the neighboring trunks. The 
leaves — if you could call them that 
— were on a scale with the trunks. 
Four or five hung like pennants be- 
low each limb. The mature ones were 
five or six feet wide at the limb, 
tapering down, ten or twelve feet 
long pale green, translucent and thin, 
but veined in red, giving an oddly 
animal impression. Birds, also pale 
green, the size of eagles but scaley 
and featherless, with parchment- 
like wings, clung to the fruit that 
hung below the maturest leaves — 
brown, rough-rinded, watermelon- 
sized, with reddish pulp that the 
birds globbled down. One bird, so 
far up the monstrous tree that his 
squawks came down only faintly, 
was flapping about what looked like 
a green meter-long lizard with eight 
or ten legs, that crouched on a limb, 
reptilian jaws agape as his h0ad 
swiveled to confront the bird. Here 
and there similar lizards, scuttled, 
their stumpy fat legs agile, their 
claws maintaining them easily on 
the trunk or the vertical leaves. The 
swamp, now that the explosions were 
ten minutes, past, was coming aliye 
with hissings and squawkings and the 
flap of wings. Somewhere far off, 
some animal bellowed repeatedly like 
a gargantuan fogjiorn. Steve said, 
“We’d better get farther from that 
wreck, and into opener country. Did 
anyone see the inlet of this lake?” 

Fazzool pointed. “Zat way. And 
zere are hills.” 

Egral, nostrils and stubby ears 
atwitch at the swamp soim^ and 
smells, protested, “Shouldn’t we 
reconnoiter a little while we’re this 
close to the Base?” 



A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE 



139 




S teve shook his head. “They might 

, comb the area, if they’re at all 

suspicious. 1 want to get to some 
high ^t where we can watch things 
for a couple of days.” He shifted 
his back to a more comfortable bal- 
ance. 

Egral grumbled, but moved out in 
front 

But after they’d gone a few yards 
a sound from high in the trees made 
Steve crouch, gun in hand. Up there, 
a horn was blowing purposefully — 
high-pitched and clear, but soft, like 
a muted bugle. He knew, as surely 
as he knew it was no natural sound, 
that there was language in that play- 
ing. Egral asked softly, “Gree?” 
Steve shook his head. “Somebody, 
or something, that doesn’t have ra- 
dio. They’re reporting on us. But 
to whom?” He looked around, then 
hurried on, staying under the ferns 
as much as possible. 

There was another horn-message 
when they started up, the inlet — 
a small river, nearly canopied over. 
Then there was another when they 
reached the edge of the swamp and 
started up a canyon. For a way there 
were ferns, but those ended where 
grassy banks sloped up to hills half- 
covered with trees like huge willows. 
They heard no more horns for a 
while. 

Sunset came before they were as 
far or as high as Steve liked. He 
chose a spreading tree beneath 
which to make camp for the night. 
While Ralph and Egral strung proxi- 
mity-alarms about, Fa^ool broke out 
rations. “Zese will do for tonight, 
but tomorrow I’ll start experimenting 
wiz local food. I wish we had brought 



some of zose fruits from ze swamp. 
But zere are ozzer bzings here, and 
plenty of lizards along ze river.” 
Steve, spreading out the backpacks 
to dry, told him, “First we’ll get 
through the night if we can, then 
we’ll find a spot we like. Then you 
can start to go native.” 

But there was no alarm during the 
night, and only a few bugles. And 
before noon the next day, they found 
a spot Steve thought would do. 

T he place was a good five miles 
from the edge of the swamp; a 
small plateau above the river but 
with a creeklet crossing it. The wil- 
lowlike trees grew thick; the grass 
— also pale green — was tall enough 
to lie in and be concealed except 
from above. There was a steep slope 
backing the plateau, with one actual 
cliff against which they made camp. 

Egral prowled restlessly, eager to 
get out the telescopes. Steve restrain- 
ed him. “First we have to be secure, 
if possible. It’ll take the rest of the 
day to set up alarms and stuff. Also, 
we ought to get a look at those 
musicians before we let them see 
us spying. Actually make contact, 
if we can.” 

Ralph said, “They don’t seem to 
have followed us since we broke 
camp this morning.” 

Egral said, “They’ve been watch- 
ing us all the time.” He jabbed a 
thumb upward. “I wasn’t sure until 
a minute ago.” 

Steve peered up through the foli- 
age. Far up in the sky was a pair of 
bird-shapes. He got to his feet, rum- 
maged around and returned with a 
small monocular. 



140 



IF 




Five minutes later he lowered the 
glass. “You’re right; they’re not 
birds. But all 1 can make out is a 
silhouette, like a small stubby-wing- 
ed plane.” 

Egral said, “I can see more. There 
are humanoids, or something like it, 
wearing those wings.” 

Steve tried to find the bird-shapes 
again, but they were out of sight. 
“You told me,” he said to the Remm, 
“tliere’d never been any humanoid 
races evolved this near the Hub.” 
Egral made the equivalent of a 
shrug. “Conditions don’t favor 
bipeds or purely diurnal animals. 
But these needn’t be native.” 
Fazzool demanded, “If Gree 
brought zem, why haven’t zey re- 
ported us? ” 

“That’s a puzzle,” Egral admitted, 
“but there they are, gliding around 
in plain sight of any aircar that 
might come by, apparently unwor- 
ried.” 

Steve said, “I don’t think even 
your eyes could see a worried ex- 
pression at that distance. But we 
have to assume they’ve at least some 
sort of truce with the Gree garrison. 
Vm worried.” 

B y evening the plateau was well 
bugged with electronic warn- 
ings, and the other gear was stowed 
out of sight. Fazzool had gone down 
to the river and killed a lizard, and 
now had slabs of its flesh sizzling 
on the hot-plate. 

Egral was padding about restless- 
ly, tail lashing. “Damn it! We haven’t 
even looked toward that Base. I’m 
going to take a telescope to the edge 
of the plateau and lie under a tree.” 



Steve had been considering the 
same thing himself. “It’ll be a while 
before Fazzool has that lizard-meat 
tested. I’ll go with you. Ralph, you 
stay here and take clinical notes, and 
we’ll help you dig the grave later.” 
He got the two biggest scopes and 
handed one to Egral. As he followed 
the impatient Remm, there was 
bugle-talk overhead. 

They found a suitable spot, set up 
the tripods and afixed the scopes, 
and carefully parted the grass. There 
was no problem locating the Base. 
Perhaps twelve miles away, airline, 
just beyond the swamp, the hills were 
speckl^ with light. Steve said, “That 
radio transmission came from the 
swamp itself, or I thought it did.” 
Egral said, “It’s possible. Can’t 
you see by starlight?” 

The starlight was a thousand times 
stronger than Steve was used to, but 
that still wasn’t much. “See what?” 
“Why, the jungle is discolored 
just this side of those lights, as if 
some of the trees were dead or in- 
jured. But it’s a much smaller patch 
than I expected.” 

Steve asked, “What’s on the 
slopes?” 

“Missile emplacements, radar 
gear, ground defenses. No large 
buildings.” 

Steve said, “Then the Base is un- 
derground. Can you see any air ac- 
tivity?” 

“Certainly. Aircars coming and 
going. Patrols, I assume.” 

Steve peered through his scope, 
saw small craft over the spot. “Wdl, 
then we’re not going to learn enough 
at a distance. I’m not surprised. 
Eventually Fazzool and I will have 



A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE 



141 




to put on uniforms and sneak in.” 

Egral said, “And in the mean- 
time?” 

Steve squirmed into a more com- 
fortable position. “In the meantime, 
we learn more about the planet and 
work out some way to create con- 
fusion, so Fazzool and I can sneak 
in.” He lay a moment, thinking. 
“Do you really believe, personally, 
that they couldn’t have found a way 
in here with ordinary null?” 

“Well,” (the Remm growled, “a 
step-by-step advance would take 
many lifetimes.” He shifted his 
weight and pointed skyward. 

“The Hub warps null as well as 
space. It’s in sight now; had you no- 
ticed?” 

“No.” Steve followed the point 
and located the slightly darker 
smudge in the awesome starfield. 
“Not very big from here, is it?” 

Egral said, “We’re still ten thou- 
sand light-years out, if distances are 
meaningful any farther in than diis. 
You should read some of the theory 
I couldn’t translate for your scien- 
tists. Especially about the polarity, 
along the axis of rotation. As far out 
the axis as fifteen thousand light- 
years, the pidl breaks matter into 
ultimate particles and whirls them 
out in the galactic plane. Eventually 
they condense into new hydrogen 
and start the long evolution into 
stars. I tried to translate into B’lant 
and Effogan by comparing the Hub 
to a centrifugal pump, but the an- 
alogy is poor.” 

Steve said, “Well, I’ll avoid the 
axis. I wouldn’t want — ” He went 
silent as Egral was suddenly on four 
feet, staring toward the camp. 



T here was a shout, followed by 
the blam of Ralph Parr’s pow- 
der-burning pistol. 

Steve rolled to his feet and ran 
after the streaking Remm. When he 
arrived, the other three were crouch- 
ed behind treetrunks, staring up- 
ward, weapons in hand. On the 
ground lay what looked like a small 
parachute draped over some bundle. 
Ralph said, “There’s another lodged 
in a tree. I thought they were para- 
chute bombs.” 

Steve stared upward until he saw 
the lodged one. Slowly, he felt for 
a flashlight. “They’ve got us pin- 
pointed. A light can’t hurt.” He 
flashed the beam on the dark object 
hanging in the shrouds. 

Fazzool, for once, gaped. “Why 
. zat is one of ze fruits from ze 
swamp! Zey — look, zere comes 
more down!” The B’lant moved to 
catch one. “Now why n zis 
world — ?” 

Ralph’s grizzled beard suddenly 
shook with laughter. “Why, it’s ob- 
vious! They worship the lizards, and 
they’re dropping us food so you 
won’t kill any more!” 

Fazzool gave him a glare, but 
reached for his knife and hacked 
off an end of the fruit. He sniffed 
at it and said wonderingly, “If zis 
is not protein — and very much 
like meat — zen I am one of zose 
lizards!” 

Steve said, “Maybe a dead one, 
if you try to eat it.” 

Fazzool shook his head vigorous- 
ly. “No. Ze birds and lizards were 
eating zem. And we can tell if ze 
rinds have been punctured.” 

Steve said, “Something funny 

IF

about this. Even if they are simply 
donating food, there’s hardly been 
time, since you killed that li^d, to 
fly down there, get fruit, bring them 
here and attach parachutes.” 

Egral said, “I don’t think they 
had to. There’s been bugle-talk, and 
some of it was from up-country.” 
Steve stared up into the dark- 
ness. “All right. Fazzool, you’d bet- 
ter give these tree-steaks the sur- 
vival test. Declining might be a mor- 
tal insult. And tomorrow we go 
hunting the source.” He looked at 
Egral. “Do you agree that making 
friends with these people may be 
the quickest way to get at the Base?” 
Egral said, “Of course. If it turns 
out that simple.” 

Ill 

B efore the sun was halfway to 
noon, they’d climbed up canyon 
to where the river emerged from a 
narrow, deep gorge. Steve paused. 
“Fine plaice for an ambush.” 
“Which,” Fazzool agreed, “may 
be why zere have been no bugles 
lately.” 

Egral unbuckled his harness. “I’ll 
scout. Shall I take a radio?” 

Steve shook his head. “Can’t risk 
even weak transmission. Better go 
a hundred yards at a time and find 
spots to signal back.” He found a 
place against a boulder and watched 
the Remm slink into the skimpy 
brush. “Apparently he’s satisfied now 
that these people aren’t with Gree.” 
Fazzool said, “We have only his 
long-range view of zem to indicate^ 
zey are humanoid. I have been cal- 
culating. A man could not glide on 



wings ze size of zose, even in zis air 
and gravity. Ozzer zings have two 
arms and two legs, loosely speaking. 
A Terran frog fits zat description.” 
Steve said, “I won’t reject his 
opinion lightly. There is something 
odd about this whole situation — 
Gree’s appearing on this particular 
planet, where humanoids are already, 
or something like them. And I think 
that plateau was artificial.” 

Ralph looked doubtful. “I’ve seen 
just such plateaus on Earth, certain- 
ly natural.” 

“Yes,” Steve admitted. “But when 
a chunk of hillside’s broken loose 
to leave a plateau like that — by 
volcano or .earthquake or whatever 
— there are signs. I walked around 
the perimeter and looked down all 
the slopes. No loose rock, no lava. 
I think it was chopped out, and the 
rock carried away somewhere, and 
that stream redirected to provide 
water.” 

Fazzool said, “If so, it was not re- 
cently.” 

Steve shrugged. “There were hu- 
manoid races with null travel fifty 
thousand years ago. Maybe there’s 
something about this particular 
region that makes it easier to get to. 
That would explain Gree’s doing it.” 
Ralph objected, “Wouldn’t it be 
pretty coincidental, our finding an 
artificial plateau right away? Unless 
there were a lot of them.” 

Steve pointed out, “We didn’t just 
happen to find it. We were lool^g 
for a good view of the swamp and 
lake. That may be why it was there.” 
Fazzool nodded slowlyw “Zen zese 
people would be retrogressed des- 
cendants.” 

143 



A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE 




“Right.” Steve looked up the 
gorge. “There’s Egral, waving.” 

T here was no ambush and no 
bugles. However, beyond the 
gorge, they found the source of the 
protein fruit and also evidence that 
the natives had not always been at 
peace with Gree. 

The cliff-enclosed valley was no 
more than a mile long and half that 
wide. At the lower end was a small 
lake. The rest didn’t look swampy, 
but there was a solid jungle of the 
protein-producing trees. Birds swarm- 
ed, their hoarse cries faint with dis- 
tance. On the upper shore of the 
lake was a cluster of devastated 
huts, charred or flattened. Tree 
houses, too, lay where they’d fallen. 
Yet, other tree houses looked intact, 
though deserted. 

Fazzool said, “A punitive raid, 
perhaps, to teach ze natives respect. 
Or prisoners may have been taken 
for study.” 

Steve was scanning the trees. 
“There could be an army of them, 
waiting. Egral, do you see any?” 
“I’m not sure,” the Remm said. 
“There was something stirring when 
we first came into sight, but it could 
have been a big lizard. What if they 
just keep avoiding us? We can’t 
chase them all over the planet!” 
Steve started down. “I think 
they’ll show themselves if we don’t 
make any threatening moves. They 
already Imow we’re not with Gree, 
but they’re probably as worried about 
us as we are about them.” 

They circled the lake and paused. 
Fazzool pointed to a tree house. 
“Look! Ze floor is made by gluing 



zose big leaves edge-to-edge some- 
how, still fastened to ze limbs! And 
ze walls and roof are of cut leaves! 
Zose must be very tough!” 

Egral said, “Big lizards crawl up 
them without leaving any claw- 
marks. And to hold those heavy 
fruit, in a storm, they’d have to be 
toiigh.” 

Steve was looking for stairways. 
What he found instead — hard to 
see against the foliage — was a long 
ladder, apparently attached at the 
top to a still-living leaf. “I think,” 
he said, “we’ll act as if we’re about 
to set up housekeeping and see what 
happens.” He walked toward the 
ladder. But when he reached it, he 
paused, astonished. It was made from 
leaves — vertical ropes and rungs, 
laminated until they were thick and 
semirigid. And the whole structure 
was green, and still alive! The rungs 
continued into the ground as if root- 
ed. The veins spread up, as well as 
downward from the high limb. He 
peered up at the houses and got 
the same impression. 

Bugles were talking. After a pause, 
one answered from the distance. He 
grinned and stepped into the open. 
“I’ll bet you each a tree-steak that 
was the okay to make contact.” 

It was only a minute until the na- 
tive came down in graceful swoops; 
face down beneath wings no more 
than four feet long but a good two- 
and-a-half wide, rigidly fixed, slant- 
ing up a little to the tips, thickly 
cambered. The fuselage was a mere 
short boom — hollow, no doubt — 
and the tail assembly was small and 
very close behind the wings. The 
whole, of course, was made from 



144 



IF 





A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE 



145 



the leaf material, still veined and 
looking alive. The humanoid’s knees 
were bent to his heels almost touch- 
ed his buttocks. His insteps fit into 
stirrups that evidently controlled the 
tail. The main support was at his 
waist — not a complete band, but 
a wide bracket open at the side so 
he could slide in. The arms were not 
extended under the wings, but bent, 
elbows at the ribs, so his hands — 
very sinewy, and overlarge for his 
size — grasped two stirrups. Those 
grips, Steve saw, were controls as 
well as supports. As the contraption 
neared the ground, the flyer’s fingers 
did things and airjets hissed. The 
apparatus tilted up, stalled, settled 
lightly. The being’s feet withdrew 
from their stirrups and swung down 
like a bird’s as he landed gracefully. 
In one contortion he was free of 
the waist-bracket; then, as if the 
apparatus weighed no more than a 
few pounds, he flipped it over and 
laid it bottom-side-up. The familiar 
laboratory smell of the trees came 
stronger from the flying apparatus. 

T he native turned, obviously ner- 
vous, staring especially at Egral. 
He wasn’t over five feet tall, very 
lean, but with tendons that stood out 
like cables. His skin was tawny; hair- 
less except for the short black curly 
patch on his head and a little beard 
on his chin His eyes were dark and 
quite human looking. 

But what Steve gaped at was the 
pair of short, straight, blunt-ended 
horns — mere vestiges — that bare- 
ly poked out of the hair. He heard 
Fazzool take a deep breath. 

Steve shook off his astonishment 



and stepped forward. “Is it possible,” 
he asked wonderingly, “that you . 
speak Effogan?” 

The native started and turned 
wide eyes at him. After a moment 
he said in a rather high voice, “We 
are the Doyt. Effogan is the tongue 
we learn from the ancient talking- 
wires. But how is it that you — the 
report says you came from the skyl 
While the others, the violent ones, 
came from the ground! The legends 
say . .” 

Steve found himself laughing. “A 
lot’s changed since your ancestors 
colonized this world. Now, other des- 
cendants fight the tyrants who did 
this — ” he indicated the blasted 
village — “and we are here to stem 
this invasion if we can. Will you 
help us?” 

A fixed look came over the na- 
tive’s face, as if he’d been briefed for 
this. “We know nothing of coloniza- 
tion, or of other worlds, if there be 
such. The legends say our ancestors 
came from the ground and might 
come again one day. In any case, we 
cannot help you fight.” 

Egral stepped forward, making the 
native flinch. “You won’t resist 
them? Even after they did this to 
you?” 

The Doyt said stubbornly, “This 
was a village of outcasts, insane 
ones, who resisted when they should 
have yielded.” 

The four were silent for a minute. 
Then Fazzool asked, “Have others 
been taken captive?” 

The Doyt looked uncomfortable. 
“A few. The men from the ground 
wanted infants and took the parents 
along. They have not bothered us 



U6 



IF 




beyond that. We avoid the place 
from which they come.” 

Steve asked, “Is that a large 
cave?” 

The Doyt said, “There were only 
the hills and the swamp. Then one 
day there was an explosion, and 
rocks and trees hurtling, and great 
ships of metal came out, rising 
without wings. We have guessed, the 
inside of the world must be hollow.” 
Steve said, “This world is not hol- 
low, nor do the invaders belong on 
it. They come from the stars and 
will enslave you and teach your 
children and your children’s children 
to fight, enslaving still other worlds, 
of which there are no end. They 
have usurped the means by which 
your ancestors came.” He turned to 
Egral. “I think it’s obvious that Gree 
forces stumbled onto some ancient 
Effogan null link somewhere, tried 
it out, and found themselves here. 
Don’t you?” 

Egrd, tail atwitch, growled, “I 
suppose so.” He stared at the Doyt 
with disgust. “You, fellow. Now that 
you know we’re not going to eat 
you, is there someone in authority?” 
The Doyt said mildly, “We are 
only a scouting band, temporarily 
bas^ in this valley. But tomorrow 
an Elder of the district will be here 
to talk to you. We had hoped you 
would not come this far; but since 
you have, I am to take you to our 
camp to wait. It is safer ^ere.” 

IV 

T hat evening the four were in a 
tree hut assigned to them, two 
hundred feet above the ground, near 



the cliffs on one side of the valley. 
Steve, who’d spent much of the day 
talking to Doyt craftsmen, had a 
small section of one of the amazing 
wings. “The whole thing’s honey- 
combed like this; that gives it 
strength. But all the alveoli, I guess 
you’d call them, are interconnected, 
so the air can distribute itself.” 
Fazzool said, ^‘I did not hear much 
of ze chemistry, and what I heard I 
doubt. Did you get it straight?” 
“Roughly,” Steve said. “It’s re- 
lated to the process by which the 
trees absorb nitrogen and carbon 
dioxide from the air to make pro- 
tein. You pump air into the wing, 
and the tissue — skin, cells, stiffen- 
ers and all — absorbs it and stores 
it as semistable compounds. The 
smell we notice is traces of nitrous 
oxide. A wing can absorb up to fif- 
teen per cent of its own weight of 
air, under pressure, and give it out 
again as the jets are used.” 

Ralph, who was a little out of 
things since he didn’t speak Effogan, 
said, “I still don’t see how such 
gentle jets hold them up.” 

Steve turned the section sideways. 
“See this raised part of the leading 
edge? There’s a thin crack at the 
rear of it, running all along the wing. 
The jet — a thin sheet of air, really 
— blows back along the camber and 
creates lift. That’s why they get such 
efficiency of a short wing and 
why they can hover without forward 
motion.” He hefted the section with 
one finger. “The whole apparatus 
weighs less than ohe-fourth as much 
as the Doyt flying it.” 

Ralph said, “Even so, if they 
want to hold altitude or climb, they 



A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE 



147 




must run out of pressure before 

long.” 

“Not too soon,” Steve said. 
“Those hand grips are little pumps, 
as well as controls. The Doyt keeps 
squeezing them as he flies. Thafs 
what makes their hands so strong. 
The pump valves are the only metal 
parts in the whole assembly.” 

Ralph grinned in his beard. ‘Td 
like to take a bunch of these people 
back to Earth and start a dairy. They 
could really milk cows!” 

Egral, who was stretched along 
the limb that bisected the floor, re- 
luctant to trust his weight to the lat- 
ter despite assurances, said, “And 
you mean to tell us they don’t need 
any adhesive? Just join the parts and 
let them grow together?” 

“Right,” Steve said, “the same 
way they }oin these floors, walls, and 
ceilings. Of course there’s techrdque 
involved. To get a perfect joint, the 
cutting has to be accurate. Then for 
an hour or so the parts have to be 
held in place and kept warm and 
moist. It beats gluing, though.” 
Egral said, “I’ll stick to metal and 
welding.” 

Fazzool got to his feet and 
bounced up and down on the flexible 
floor, as if it were a trampoline, 
making Steve and Ralph grab for 
handholds. “Zis is not to be sneezed 
at. Especially when ze same trees 
grow meat for you, right outside ze 
door.” 

Egral scowled. “A remarkable bo- 
tanical science, I admit. Too bad 
they haven’t turned it to weapons. 
Steve, how do you plan to handle 
the Elder who’s coming?” 

Steve shrugged. “I’ll have to play 



it by ear. Maybe I’ll give .him a 
good rundown on the galactic situ- 
ation and let him think about it 
for a day or two before I put any 
pressure on him.” 

44T am Jubbelyn.” 

X The Elder was as lean and 
cordy as if braided of rope, his skin 
not young but tauter and healthier 
than one might expect from his 
white chin beard and near-naked 
scalp, the latter accentuating the ves- 
tigial horns. His black eyes were alert 
but calm as he surveyed the four. 

Steve said, “We’re honored. No 
doubt you already know our names 
and our mission.” 

The hint of a smile crossed the 
wrinkled face. “Everything has been 
reported. Forgive me if I comprehend 
slowly. We are sorry your ship was 
destroyed, but rejoice that you sur- 
vived. If there is any concern in 
your minds that we will betray you 
to your enemies, please bani^ it. 
You may take refuge among us if 
you wish; or, should you prefer, we 
will lead you to some hidden valley 
far from here, where you may live 
out your lives in peace.” 

Steve tried not to stare. Could the 
native be this innocent? Or Wias this 
a gentle hint that they shouldn’t 
make trouble? He said slowly, “I 
don’t think you understand the situ- 
ation. Gree will not let anyone live 
in peace, on this world or any other 
he can conquer, except the slavery 
that he calls peace. We speak of 
Gree, from habit, as a person; but 
these invaders from outside the 
galaxy are not humanoids nor even 
animals. They are artificial beings of 



148 



IF 




metal, without emotions as you and 
I think of emotions. The humanoids 
who serve them are Slaves, so com- 
pletely indoctrinated from birth that 
their devotion is fanatical to the 
death. The symbol called Gree is 
not an actual being, but a half-alive 
simulacrum controlled by a metal 
being. The physical appearance of 
that ghoul is copied from remaining 
statues of the oldest humanoid race 
in this galaxy — the Men of Effogus, 
your own ancestors. The fraud is an 
effort to cash in on lingering legends 
among other races.” 

Jobbelyn said calmly, “Are you 
quite sure you yourselves have not 
been misled as to the nature and in- 
tent of your enemies?” 

Steve, a little nonplussed, gestur- 
ed toward Fazzool. “Ask him. He 
was born a Slave. / spent years in 
that role, as a spy. We know.” 

The Doyt sighed, shifted his po- 
sition on ^e floor limb and stared 
out at the busy jungle. Presently he 
faced Steve and said, almost sadly, 
“It appears to me you are as fanati- 
cal as those you fight. I wonder if 
you can answer me frankly — are 
you out of touch with your own 
forces? Do they know where you 
are?” 

Steve decided there was nothing 
to be gained by evasion. ‘They know 
exactly where we are. And we have 
means of reporting to them.” 
Jobbelyn brooded over that for a 
minute. “That is as we feared. What 
we can expect, then, is a war on our 
planet — your side attacking the 
Base, their side defending?” 

“I’m afraid so. But there is this 
difference 7— we won’t enslave you.” 



T he Elder made a gesture of gen- 
tle rejection. “I don’t doubt 
your sincerity. But the others have 
promised the same thing. They treat 
us almost as children, but with a 
hint of respect. Perhaps they secret- 
ly admire our peaceful natures.” 
Steve said, “Don’t be deceived. 
They have to be gentle with you 
for tlie moment because of your ap- 
pearance — clearly similar to the 
one they’ve chosen as the Gree sym- 
bol. Otherwise, they’d have trouble 
with the Slaves. But the Overseers 
know the deception; they aren’t 
Slaves, but a race whose treason has 
been bought. And they will be your 
masters, when the planet’s secured.” 
Jubbelyn sighed again. “I cannot 
dispute you. But we have discussed 
this thing, and our decision is to 
remain neutral. We will try to do 
nothing to anger either side. We 
are willing to evacuate this whole 
region, up to a radius of a full hun- 
dred miles. We hope you and the 
others will confine your war to that 
area, and that whichever side wins 
will keep its promises.” 

Steve stared in disbelief and baffle- 
ment. A hundred miles? When even 
a hasty hit-and-run attack might 
devastate half the planet? But if he 
told Jubbelyn that, it would sound 
like a threat. Slowly he said, “Why 
do you think the invaders have taken 
infants? Already they’re starting a 
creche!” 

Jubbelyn smiled. “If you are right, 
they wiU be disappointed. Violence 
was bred out of our natures countless 
generations ago. We do not even kill 
for food — and I have been told 
you do.” He got to his feet. “I must

be leaving, to report this talk to my 
colleagues. I thank you for your 
hooesty. Should you reconsider your 
plans, our offer still remains. We 
can give you happy lives. Not all our 
settlements are primitive villages. 
Th^e are cities of many thousands, 
with theaters and games and mu- 
seums, and other diversions. You 
may work or play or simply relax, 
as you choose. Perhaps we can even 
build you wings. If not, there are 
riding' animals, and ships for sea 
travel, and a great variety of cli- 
mates and geographies. Please give 
it thought. And now, excuse me.” 

V 

E gral, ears twitching at the night 
sounds, paced gingerly around 
the edge of the floor and climbed 
inte the bisecting limb. “I don’t 
see that we have the right,” he told 
Steve severely, “to worry about the 
welfare of these people. You’ve re- 
minded me often enough that the 
galaxy is at stake.” 

Ralph put in, ‘'You were ready 
enough to sacrifice Earth, if neces- 
sary.” 

^^eve scowled at the bearded man. 
“I wasn’t ready at all. There was 
nothing I could do except try to 
save her. / was on Earth too at the 
time, don’t forget. I don’t say we 
have to shirk our mission here. All I 
say is, we ought to think hard be- 
fore we deliberately involve the 
Doyt. Fazzool, you were going to 
nose around for Doyt weapons. Did 
you see any?” 

Fazzool spread his gray hands. 
“What is a weapon? A matter of 



employment, is it not? Zey have 
knives, of good steel zey make zem- 
selves. Zey have fireworks — zose 
were described to me — so zey have 
gunpowder, at least. And zey drop 
noise-bombs, and bombs wiz am- 
monia and ozzer gasses, to drive 
dangerous animals away. Also — zo 
I did not see it — zere is a dart- 
thrower zat uses ze plant chemistry 
to build up gas pressure to shoot ze 
dart. Zey have darts zat will mere- 
ly sting like ze devil, or darts to 
put you to sleep. Zey use zose on ze 
few criminals who resist banish- 
ment.” 

Steve said, “I wanted to ask Jub- 
belyn more about that, but didn’t get 
a chance. What about the criminals? 
Are there many? Is there a police 
force?” 

Fazzool drew his feet up under 
him. “I had quite a talk wiz ze same 
Doyt zat first met us. Zis group here 
belongs to a sort of constabulary. 
To belong to it, a Doyt must be 
very much against violence and only 
willing to use it in extreme necessity. 
Zat is rare, and even zen zey use ze 
sleep-darts or gas and do not kill. 

constabularies of different dis- 
tricts have only voluntary co-opera- 
tion between zem. Ze criminals are 
a very small percentage.” 

' Steve grunted. “I almost wish 
we’d run into savages instead. Do 
you suppose we could find a few 
of the criminals?” 

Fazzool grinned. “Ze Gree garri- 
son had zat idea first. Ze local ones 
are already rounded up. Maybe ze 
Overseers intend zem for breeding- 
stock.” 

“Yeah,” Steve muttered. “All 

IF 



150 




right; suppose we tricked the garri- 
son into a couple of punitive bomb- 
ings on real cities. Do you think that 
Doyt would fight back?” 

Fazzool shook his head. “A few 
individuals, maybe. As a society, no.” 
Egral said impatiently, “Even so, 
a little resistance here and there 
might create the confusion we need.” 
Steve said, “Maybe. But the Doyt 
might catch on quick that we’d ar- 
ranged it and turn us in. I’m willing 
personally, to take a bigger risk if 
we can avoid using the Doyt. Egral, 
I can’t demand the same of you, but 
I can ask. If you’d seen as many 
happy, peaceful races dragged in 
as I have . .” 

The Remm scowled. “Colonel 
Duke, you have a very under-handed 
way of making a person’s decency 
oppose his better judgment. I’ll 
agree as far as personal risk is con- 
cerned. But it’s my home world that’s 
the soft, nearby target, and I can’t 
risk that. I insist that, whatever we 
do, we have an alternate plan in- 
volving the Doyt, to switch to if 
necessary.” 

Steve glanced at Fazzool and 
Ralph, who nodded. “Fair enough. 
Now, how about concrete sugges- 
tions?” 

Fazzool said, “Well, zere’s nozzing 
like ambushing a ground patrol in 
a swamp to start creating confusion.” 

T he backpack interfered with 
Steve’s movements. He coiled 
the scaling-rope and tossed again. 
This time, as the rope slid back, the 
improvised hook caught the limb 
above him. He went up hand-over- 
hand and hauled himself, grunting 



with effort, onto the limb. One of 
the parchment-winged birds, ap- 
parently undecided between curiosity 
and indignation, hovered with quick 
little wing strokes a few feet away, 
squawking tentatively, its reptilian 
head cocking at various angles. 

Steve coiled the rope and stuffed it 
into his pack. It wasn’t comfortable, 
sitting here a hundred feet up, know- 
ing he daren’t use the grav to break 
a fall, this close to the Base. He 
straddled the limb and got his back 
against the trunk. A bugle sounded 
faintly, back the way they’d oome. 
It worried him that the Doyt had 
followed this far. Neither was he 
satisfied with his view of the trail 
below, but he didn’t have all day to 
find a better spot. For that matter, 
there wasn’t much of the day left. 
He glanced up to make sure he had 
head clearance beneath the nearest 
of the pendant fruit. 

A complaining of birds began a 
little way up the trail. That would 
be Ralph, climbing to his perch. 
Fazzool — less vulnerable, with his 
thick skin, to a hasty rake of a 
hand-beamer — was already set, at 
ground level. Steve frowned at his 
watch. If Egral, scouting the patrol, 
let himself be seen or heard too far 
away, the ambush wouldn’t oome 
off. 

The birds settled down again to 
their late afternoon feeding. Lizards 
climbed about nimbly. Now that he 
was used to the clinic odor of the 
trees, it was rather pleasant. Some- 
where at the edge of hearing, the 
foghorn-voiced animal boomed. He 
looked at his watch again and began 
to feel tense. He wiped his palms on 



A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE 



151 




the uniform he’d donned and drew 
his handgun. This waiting before 
action was always agony. 

It was five or six minutes later 
that he heard B’lant voices. He took 
in a deep uncomfortable breath and 
tried to control his trembling. The 
leader of the patrol — a B’lant Gun- 
ner Second, wearing a visor cap in- 
stead of the uncomfortable standard 
hehnet — came into sight. His blunt 
features were bored; his heavy beam- 
er carried loosely over a forearm. 
Steve fretted. Would they all have 
heavy guns? Then the next B’lant 
came into sight: a Gunner Third, no 
doubt in command, with only a bol- 
stered pistol. The one following him, 
and the two humans next in file, also 
had only handguns. The B’lant bring- 
ing up the rear had another heavy 
beamer. Steve let out his breath 
and gulped in another. Where was 
Egral? 

An animal sound, more a whuff 
of surprise than a growl, made the 
patrol spin as one man. The rear 
guard jerked up his beamer, then 
lowered it. Steve raised his pistol. 

The Gunner, Third, spoke for 
his throat-mike. “This is GPF Six- 
teen. We’ve just sighted a large, 
black animal of a new species! We 
only got a glimpse, but — ” 

S teve’s weapon spat incandescence. 

The B’lant’s voice choked off, 
and he went down. Now pencils of 
fire lanced in from other directions. 

One of the men ran a few steps, 
screaming, before he dropped; the 
olhers died faster, with cries on their 
lips. Steve had deliberately waited 
to hear die patrol commander’s 



voice. Now he tried to imitate it. 
“Sixteen! Four of the beasts attacked 
and we — ” 

He fired the pistol again and let 
out a muffled cry, then dove off the 
limb, harness grav turned on. He 
could risk it now, with aircars surely 
converging, masking* the electronic 
spill. He landed and ran toward the 
scene of the massacre. Fazzool was 
already there, stripping equipment 
from corpses, tucking under them 
and distributing around small ob- 
jects. Egral galloped up. “Hurry — 
something coming down from high 
up!” 

Steve finished equipping himself 
and plunged down the trail as Egral 
raced off in the other direction. He 
heard Fazzool and Ralph pounding 
after him. He fumbled at the pocket- 
radio in his left hand, got a Gree 
channel. An Overseers’ voice was 
snarling commands, directing aircars 
toward the ambush. A car reported, 
“This is AP Twelve, landing. Will 
send eight men along the trail, ready 
to shoot.” 

Steve ran a little while longer, 
then turned off the trail and went 
very slowly, paralleling it. His two 
companions caught up. Presently he 
heard the eight troopers going by. 

The aircar was in a clearing from 
which several trails diverged. Steve 
halted where he could just see the 
four helmeted occupants, glanced 
around at Fazzool and Ralph, signal- 
ed and moved away to set up a 
crossfire. He found himself a spot 
and hesitated. He was calm now 
that action had begun, but this was 
a ticklish moment. The four in the 
aircar had to die quickly.

He aimed and sent lightning at 
the one in the pilot’s seat. 

Two of the four touted words 
before they died. Steve was already 
plunging forward. He siboved his 
dead pilot aside and spoke hurriedly 
into the radio grill: “AP Twelve! 
We just saw one of the strange ani- 
mals and wounded it! Shall we pur- 
sue?” 

There was a pause of fifteen sec- 
onds. Then the Overseer’s voice said, 
“AP Twelve, stay in your vehicle 
and wait for your squad. You are 
the only car close by.” 

The order didn’t quite ring true to 
Steve. He shot a look at Fazzool, 
who shook his head. Steve grabbed 
heavy beamers, tossed them to Faz- 
zool and Ralph, leaned into the car 
to get extra energy-units. “Let’s get 
out of here!” 

The radio was silent now. That 
meant, of course, the ruse was dis- 
covered. Cursing mentally, Steve 
sloshed through mud, wide of the 
path, but toward the Base. The only 
hope now — a faint one — was 
that Egral’s various diversions would 
draw the search away. 

A cluster of explosions rocked the 
swamp. That would be the radio- 
linked booby traps Fazzool had set 
around the original ambush. Steve 
swore. Now that didn’t seem such a 
good idea — it clearly revealed 
technology. Fazzool whispered, “We 
must hide somewhere near ze Base 
and hope for a chance to sneak in 
later! It would be suicide now!” 

Steve nodded, slogging on. He 
hoped Egral was still galloping up- 
country, not pausing to reconnoiter. 
Would the Remm guess, from the 



radio silence, that things were sour 
akeiady? No doubt. But what could 
he do? He could go through with 
the tricks to implicate the Doyt. But 
he wouldn’t, Steve felt, so long as 
there was hope. He’d stick to the 
promise Steve, in his squeamishness, 
had extracted. 

Steve tried his radio, hoping for 
another channel, but there was none. 
How was the garrison co-ordinating? 
And why hadn’t any of Egral’s fake 
messages come over? 

An aircar whooshed over, headed 
up country. Maybe the Remm was 
already dead, or surrounded and 
pinned down. Fazzool — obviously 
thinking along the same lines — said, 
“Maybe Egral has decided it would 
be foolish now to break ze silence.” 

Steve didn’t answer. He was busy 
trying to find solid footing. 

Ralph — the best woodsman of 
the three — suddenly jerked into 
motion. His primitive pistol roared. 

VI 

S omething zipped by Steve’s cheek. 

A dart! At once, a slight, green- 
clad body came tumbling to thud 
nearby. Steve leaped for cover, fran- 
tically scanning the trees overhead. 
Fazzoo lunged for the Doyt corpse, 
came dragging it to the root tangle. 
“He has a pistol too, so he was wiz 
Gree! He used ze dart because zey 
want us alive!” 

Somewhere, a bugle talked. So 
that was how the garrison was com- 
municating. 

Steve gave the trees another quick 
scrutiny, then was running again — 
not toward the Base, nor away from 



A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE

iti but laterally, as silently as he 
could, sacrificing speed for cover. 
This) the least purposeful direction, 
offered the best chance of evading 
the immediate search at least until 
dark. 

Night wasn’t long coming. Now 
they picked their way cautiously until 
there was no sound of aircars or 
bugles, then found cover beneath 
roots. Steve asked softly, “Anyone 
see more than the one Doyt?” 

Ralph Parr said, “No. If there 
were more, we’ve lost them by now.” 

“That’s not the point.” Steve 
paused, listening. “So far that Doyt’s 
the only one who’s seen us, unless 
there were others with him. So the 
garrison still may not know we’re 
humanoid. That makes it possible 
for us to go on with the original 
plan of sneaking in as survivors — 
if there’s some more confusion. By 
now, the Overseers must realize the 
Remm are involved, whether they 
actually know the Remm body shape 
or not. Maybe later tonight . 

Fazzool said, “2^e is not zat 
much time. Zey will pick up Doyt 
asd make zem tell.” 

Steve swore. “Well, then — if we 
can get beyond the Base, into the 
hills, maybe we can sneak into a 
relief crew for a missile emplace- 
ment, or something. But first I’ve 
got to get off a message to the Remm 
that things are busted open.” He 
fumbled in his pack for an object 
like a very large cigar; pulled it in 
two, spoke at length into one half, 
reunited it, gave it two twists and 
tossed it away from him. 

“That will null in twenty minutes. 
Let’s move!” 



I t was slow going. When the drone 
nulled, the implosion was disheait- 
eningly near. Steve speeded up to 
the point of recklessness. An hour 
dragged by as they jogged on, splash- 
ing throu^ mud, panting for breath. 
Aircars whooshed over, listening, no 
doubt, for any electronic spill. 

Suddenly the radio came to life. 
“I have seen one of the creatures! 
They are not primitive animals, but 
advanced beings! He was carrying 
— ” A blast drowned out the voice. 

Then the radio was silent again. 
Ralph whispered, “Hell. Did they 
get Egral with a grenade or some- 
thing?” 

Fazzool chuckled, “Za^ w^ Egral 
talking. Ze fake was meant to be 
transparent; zat is why he did not 
identify. But it was probably a de- 
layed transmission. Ze question is, 
why?” 

Steve said, ‘To keep up the con- 
fusion. He gave away no informa- 
tion, but the Overseers will have to 
consider a lot of -things. Tlie mes- 
sage could be genuine. Or it might 
be intended merely to pinpoint a 
spot, for other commandos or a land- 
ing. Or just to establish co-ordinates. 
And the missiles will /have to be 
manned, against possible attack from 
space. And ships will have to null 
off.” 

Fazzool said, “Ah! Overload ze 
garrison! Good scheming, for a lingu- 
ist!” 

“A linguist,” Steve said, “who’s 
served with a Task Force. Well, we 
have to get somewhere while the 
bustle’s on.” He peered ahead for 
sound footing. 

Minutes later, a boom came dis- 

IF

tantly, then a series. Ships nulling 
hastily from stratosphere — all us- 
ing up personnel. But there was a 
bad feature. With a defending fleet 
around the planet, the Remm might 
have no time for niceties. 

A few yards farther along, light 
suddenly burst above the trio. 

B lindly, Steve hurled himself for 
the nearest low root. Other 
light flares bloomed all over the area, 
descending very slowly on gravs. A 
loudspeaker grated, “Stay with your 
units and don’t lose oontacti There 
are only a few, but they move fast!” 
The tone of the voice changed. “You, 
whatever you are! If you want to live, 
show yourselves, without weapons I” 
Steve squirmed cautiously into 
better shooting position, the heavy 
beamer resting over his left forearm. 
If they were staying in squads, that 
was fine. He’d wait until he saw 
them, then rake the whole squad. He 
hoped Ralph and Fazzool would 
stay hidden until they got good 
targets, too — not sell their lives in 
foolish heroics. He wasn’t particular 
scared; he could bury the primitive 
emotion in his belly. But he couldn’t 
banish the regret or the despair, or 
the shame of failure. If he hadn’t 
been squeamish about the Doyt .... 

A Slave Warrior suddenly cried 
out in surprise. Then the jungle erupt- 
ed. Darts rained. Somewhere, soft 
plops marked the bursting of gas- 
bombs. The shocked Gree troc^ 
were firing wildly into the trees, 
bringing down a torrent of debris. An 
Overseer, shouting, ran into sight, 
clutching at his cheek, and collapsed. 
A flare dropped, weighted down by 



some kind of hooped net. The radio 
babbled now. Bugles blew purpose- 
fully Steve squirmed free of the 
root and was running, away from 
where the gas bombs had fallen. 
“Ral^! Fazzool!” He hurdled prone 
Warriors, some still stirring. 

A big dark form bounded into 
his path. “Quick!” Egral snarled. 
“We have an aircar for you!” 

D espite the confusion in the 
swamp, the garrison was re- 
acting efficiently. Aircars were land- 
ing to unload casualties, re-equip, 
and take off again with full crews. 
Blinker-ligjhts were being mounted 
on some craft, for signalling. Flame- 
throwers were being hustled to the 
crews, and crates of antipersonnel 
bombs. 

Fazzool pointed. “Zat looks like 
de-briefing!” 

Steve set the aircar down in the 
lighted area. Troops covered them 
with beamers during a careful scru- 
tiny, then they were urged forward. 
An Overseer demanded, “Where’s 
your squad leader?” 

“D-dead,” Steve told him. “Some 
weapon that made no noise and no 
tight! He — his head just exploded!” 
The Overseer’s scowl deepened. 
“How did you two survive?” 

Steve touched his own cheek. “A 
dart grazed me, and I collapsed. I 
guess they thought I was dead. When 
I came to I saw him — ” he indi- 
cated Fazzool — “stumbling around. 
He’s still dazed. The area was de- 
serted, so I got him to a car and 
took off.” 

Fazzool mumbled, “Something big 
and black ... it knocked me down

from behind. My head ” 

The Overseer demanded of Steve, 
“Did you see the attackers?” 

“Yes, sir. Two of them, anyway.” 
He described Egral. 

“Remm,” the Overseer growled. 
“It must be. So they have six limbs? 
Did you see any vehicles?” 

“N-no, sir. But there was a hum- 
ming in the trees.” 

“Damnation! Well, get your squad- 
mate to Med Center, then you re- 
port to the general pool.” The Over- 
seer turned away. 

Steve pretended to help Fazzool 
until they were out of sight, then 
they ran toward two great wooden 
doors that closed a fresh scar in a 
hiUslde. 

Guards blocked the way. Steve 
said, “Orders to man a ship!” 

The leading trooper demanded, 
“When was that. Gunner? Everything 
scrambled an hour ago!” 

Steve said, “More nulling in, with 
short crews!” 

“Oh.” the guard stepped aside; 
motioned to a trooper to open a 
small door in the large one. Steve 
plunged in, Fazzool at his heels. 

VII 

T he ancient terminal had obvious- 
ly been hollowed from the hill, 
with a short tunnel to the exit. The 
blast that had opened that had dam- 
aged nothing else. For a moment 
Steve paused, fascinated by the un- 
familiar look of the vast null-tank, 
then he strode toward a Tech who 
seemed to be in charge. “Why aren’t 
preparations going on? Where are 
the munitions?” 



The Tech — a thick-muscled, 
phlegmatic Gjiss — blinked. “Prep- 
arations? I don’t understand.” 

Steve glared. “Why don’t you 
listen for orders? There are ships 
coming in, and they need missiles 
and power units! Where’s yoiu: Sec- 
tion Leader?” 

The Gjiss looked slowly disturbed. 
“He was called away for Patrol 
Duty. They left us short handed, 
and ...” 

Steve snarled, “All right! Where’s 
the arsenal? Can you at least start 
getting C-7’s out here? Is there a 
conveyor system?” 

“Er, no. Gunner, not yet. We use 
carts.” 

“Get about it, then. Don’t you 
know there’s a battle shaping? Where 
are the power units?” 

“In there. Gunner.” The Tech 
pointed to a tunnel. 

Steve and Fazzool ran toward the 
tunnel. Recently installed sliding 
doors lined one side. Fazzool point- 
ed. “Zat one!” The B’lant jabbed a 
button, and the door slid open. Lights 
went on in the compartment. 

Steve muttered thanks for some- 
one’s efficiency. Units were already 
on carts, ready for call. He and Faz- 
zool shoved one out. 

The Techs were just bringing a 
heavy missile on a long, low cart. 
Steve hesitated in the mouth of the 
tunnel, handgun ready. He sighed. 
He’d already used up his quota of 
squeamishness for this trip. He fired 
efficiently, Fazzool’s beam joining 
his. Only one of the Techs managed 
an outcry. 

Steve crouched a moment, staring 
toward the exit, than ran toward the 



A BEACHHEAD FOR GREE 



157 




null tank. Stepping over the corpses, 
he studied the controls. Symbols in 
B’lant and English had been stenciled 
on them. Simple enough. He darted 
toward the missile cart. “Let’s get 
this inside!” 

They put the missile in the tank, 
then trundled the power unit in be- 
side it. The missile would serve as 
timer and detonator; the unit would 
provide the awful energy to slag 
the tank. Fazzool said, “We could 
null zis gift somewhere first, zen 
blow up zis end.” 

“No time!” Steve was working 
frantically at the fuse-settings. He 
finished, shoved Fazzool out ahead 
of him. “Hurry!” He leaped for the 
tank controls and stood fidgeting un- 
til the mighty steel doors began to 
grind shut, then ran for the exit 
tunnel. If the guards held them up 
now .... He glanced at his watch, 
forced himself to stand inside the 
small door for ten seconds. Fazzool, 
delighted with the suspense, grinned 
at him. Then Steve pounded on the 
door. A bolt rattled outside, and the 
guard peered in. Steve barked, “Get 
a med team with a stretcher!” 

The guard leaned in to stare 
around. Fazzool jerked him forward 
and got a hand to his throat. The 
guard reacted fast, but Steve’s knife 
was ready. They dragged the body 
inside, then ran out, shouting, “Guns! 
Take cover! The enemy is nulling 
in!” Everyone within earshot turned 
to stare. Steve dove for the nearest 
cover, a small concrete bunker. Faz- 
zool landed on top of him. 

There were shouts and pounding 
footsteps, then nothing else. Steve 
held his breath. Had they failed? 



Then the universe seemed to ex- 
plode. The bunker floor heaved, 
banging his head against a wall. 
Da:^, he fumbled in a pocket, 
brought out a message-drone, pulled 
it apart, grasped into it, ‘Mission ac- 
compli^ed . null tank destroyed.” 
Debris rained on the bunker-roof. 

Somehow he got the drone re- 
united and tossed it out. In the bed- 
lam, he couldn’t hear it null. 

T here was nothing wrong with 
him that a good slug of Remm 
medicinal alcohol didn’t remedy. 

One of the huge dumbbell-shaped 
Remm ships was pouring out more 
occupation personnel. The Base was 
secure; enemy survivors were still be- 
ing hunted down, but they were no 
problem. 

Jubbelyn, looking tired and be- 
wildered, was answering Fazzool’s 
question. “No, it was nothing that 
you or your friends did that changed 
our mi^s. It was the garrison’s use 
of our own people against you, and 
finally against us. In one summer — 
less, in some cases — Gree’s psy- 
chologists were able to make not 
only traitors, but actual killers, out 
of them! And not only the outcast. 
The perfectly normal people w'ho 
were taken, too.” He was silent for 
a minute. “I guess I shouldn’t have 
been surprise when, one by one, my 
own constables forsook the ban 
against killing.” He shuddered. “But 
when I saw the first of them pick up 
an enemy weapon and use it de- 
liberately .... Yet, before the fight 
was over, I was doing it myself.” 
Steve said, “I hope your casual- 
ties were few.” 



158 



IF 




The Elder sighed. “We had casu- 
alties. But what hurts is what we’ve 
been forced to learn about our- 
selves.” 

Egral said, “Knowing that civili- 
zation is a state of mind needn’t 
cause you to abandon it.” 

Jubbelyn shook his head — a ges- 
ture he’d just learned. “No, we can- 
not retreat back into our dream now, 
knowing what rages among the 
stars.” He got to his feet, looking list- 
lessly around for his flying appara- 
tus. “I must go and start organizing 
relief. Some of our cities were pun- 
ished.” 

Egral said to Steve, “To answer 
your earlier question, I was able to 
follow your progress pretty well and 
guess it, by listening to the enemy 
search. Then, when I’d fixed up a 
few diversions here and there, I 
simply called out to the Doyt that 
I knew they were watching me and 
explained frankly what might hap- 
pen to their world if you couldn’t 
destroy the null terminal. They’d 
discovered by that time that some 
of their own race were being used 
as scouts. They decided to take a 
limited part. I told fhem what wea- 
pons and tactics they’d be up against. 



By the time we organized the party 
to come look for you, they’d already 
had their illusions knocked out of 
them.” He glanced toward a squad of 
Remm probing through rubble. “It’s 
too bad there wasn’t some way we 
could trace the other end of that 
null link before destroying this end. 
It seems my superiors have a whole 
new system of fleet operations and 
materiel. They made fairly short 
work of the defending Gree ships. 
There are a few still to be hunted 
down, of course.” 

Steve said, “That’s not all. There 
was more than one setting on that 
null tank. The ancient race must 
have had a whole network of planets 
connected with this one, and no 
doubt Gree sent scouting forces, at 
least, to all of them.” He glanced 
at Fazzool and Ralph Parr. “I sup- 
pose we’ll be staying here near the 
Hub for a while, to do some sniffing 
around.” 

Egral yawned like a great feline. 
“Sniffing around? With your noses? 
If there’s a network of worlds to be 
scouted, some of them will have in- 
habitants. I’m sure my superiors will 
agree that you need a linguist along.”

HUE 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

I wonder how many readers no- 
ticed one of the interesting touches 
that Bertram Chandler put into 
‘‘Edge of Night?” I would probably 
have missed it myself if I had not 
waited until I had both installments 
and read the work in one sitting. 

When the C or amr/ Destroyer re- 
turns from its mission in the other 
universe, it is not exactly the same 
ship, nor are its crew precisely 
the same people. Note: on page 
eleven of the first installment Sonya 
is described as having pale blonde 
hair; in the short, final chapter she 
has red ihair. The reader is left to 
speculate to what other ways the 
protagonists have been changed by 
their Mannschenn drive. Masterful! 

In the “Hue and Cry” John Ban- 
ner suggests that you should re- 
print old pulp covers as a possible 
improvement over some of the cur- 
rent atrocities. Mr. Sanner obviously 
is not familiar with the old pulp 
covers. Save for the conspicuous 
absence of a scantily clad “sexy 
babe” a number of your recent cov- 
ers have come right from a late- 
forties copy of Startling or ThrilU 
ing Wonder, In fact, by carefully 



going through my file of these two 
magazines I could probably come 
up with some covers that are both 
better done and illustrate more 
closely the stories that your covers 
supposedly illustrate. — Carrington

Dear Editor: 

After I finished reading Relief s 
War, I thought it was about the best 
novel Keith Laumer would ever put 
down. It had lots of fast-paced 
action, his typical oddball aliens and 
equally oddball humans, and good 
dialog. That was until I read Earth- 
blood. All I associated Rosel George 
Brown with was some story in which 
an ostracized flower arranger, or 
whatever, and a four year old genius 
got involved with the roundest thing 
in the world ... I think. I don't 
remember the title or where I read 
it; don't bother telling me where I 
can find this classic, I wish I never 
read in the first place. It was awful. 
Yea, verily! The name of Rosel 
George Brown drifted into the limbo 
of my subconscious. That was until 
I read Earthblood. (Gee, I never 
knew I could write like that.) 



160 




When I started the first install- 
ment, I was slightly apprehensive 
about it due to the tenuon^y sinister 
recollection of Mr. Laiuner’s colla- 
borator. After the first diapter I 
thought it was terrific. No, not ter- 
rific. That term is too hackneyed 
to describe it. After careful consid- 
eration I would call it beautiful. 

Keith Laumer is my f avorite writ- 
er in The Genre. I always thought 
that he was a good writer but if he 
could turn out stories on his own 
like Earthblood, he would be a great 
writer. Perhaps Mr. Laumer will 
turn out material like Earthblood 
on his own. I nominate Earthblood 
for the Hugo award for the best 
serial of this or any other year. 

By the way several of my friends 
agree with me that the Retief 
stories would make a fine teevee 
series; infinitely better than the 
^‘science fiction” series on today. 
What say you, Gentle Editor? —

the TV producers Pve suggested it

Dear Editor: 

Being a Robert A. Heinlein fan 
from way back, I have finally de- 
cided that I must make contact with 
other science-fiction connoiseurs with 
the same impeccable tastes. Having 
decided on the magazine that these 
type of people might read, I now 
make my plea: “Heinleinoids of the 
World, Come to My Aid . My 
Flame Is Flickering Fast . 
Help Me Contact the Others of My 
Own Species ... I Will Join Any 
Club ... Do Anything ...” As 
you can see, I am not one of those 
BEM fanatics. 



I would also give anything to 
know the address of “The Great 
On^ so that 1 can write him. 

I would now like to tell the read- 
ers a trick which 1 have learned re- 
centiiy on how to preserve paper- 
backs. I bought some transparent 
vinyl contact which is available in 
most dime-stores and cut it to size. 
It prevents cracks, peeling, banding, 
scraping etc. My library of S.F. 
is one of the best preserved of any 
addict I know. — Matthew Venable,

Dear Editor: 

Your stories in World of If have 
been almost uniformly and increas- 
ingly good, and they seem to be 
getting even better. 

Even so, I have a complaint. While 
the stories are good, the art work 
you carry is almost uniformly bad. 
If you can lafford stories from writ- 
ers of the qualiify of Heinlein, An- 
derson and Laumer, surely you can 
get some art work of the same 
quality. I have not yet been able 
to understand the goal or policy of 
your art editor. Surely Fantasy and 
Science Fiction and Analog do not 
have a monojKily controlling the 
artists they feature (who are just 
as good as yours are bad). Schoen- 
herr, Freas and Bonestell, to name 
just a few, ail do excellent work. 

As a critical reader I believe 
that the quality of art work you 
feature, esi>ecially the cover piece, 
has a great effect on the way the 
magazine is received. With art work

Dear Editor: 

Read with interest your editorial 
on prediction of futures hy the 
RAND panel. Interestingly, there 
seems to ibe a built in lag of about 
a decade — probably attributable 
to the latent “fear” factw. Fear of 
change will cause the prophet to 
push events off, usually by a con- 
stant “force”, yielding a limited 
range of “effective push”. A group 
would tend to show a similar paired 
constant and variable. 

The IQ-passing computer will be 
built between 1975 and 1980. I don't 
know the exact year, but first suc- 
cessful run of the program will be 
in the Fall. 

Autolang translators was the pan- 
eVs closest guess. Will be used at an 
international meeting in the sum- 
mer of 1973. 

Come now, 1980 for the wide 
access general data facility? Hell, 
the facility will open to limited 
public use early in 1976. 

Manned landing on Mars will be 
1974. 

And the economic minimum agree- 
ments will be a lot sooner than 2025. 
Most of the world population will 
be included by 1990 — and provi- 
sions for the rest will already be 
underway. 1983 the actual agreement 
in world council. 

Trouble with the “median” method 
they're using is that the average 
prophet isn't very good. Ability isn't 
on a Maxwell curve, but a skewed 
to the weak curve. Education in 
the areas involved doesn't necessarily 
help. It's like the difference between 
recognition and use vocabulary tests. 
The ability is far less dependent 
upon information stored than on the 
resolving power of the mind in a 
particular area. — Gene Fowler,

• Nope, not so. RAND ran con- 

trol experiments on questions with 
known answers. Median was more 
accurate than any individual. —

Dear Editor: 

I have just finished Earthblood, 
and I thought that it was one of 
the two most pointless serials I 

have ever seen in your magazine. 
In the last part, it gave a strong 
impression that all this Roan Cor- 
nay chap does is run about killing 
people, throwing them through walls, 
getting drunk and similar highly 
thalamic activities. 1 could find 
traces of Retief's A-line, but almost 
none of the talent shown in the Re- 
tief stories. There not only was no 
Retiefian humor, but there was 
none of the atmosphere of weird- 
ness that hangs through such works 
as The Hounds of HelL In short, 
Earthblood was a complete dud. 

Silkies in Space, aside from its 
title, which brings to mind images 
of all sorts of space opera, was very 
good. When the fact that two Van 
Vogt stories were out at the same 
time is considered, a highly at- 
tractive conduaion is the Van Vogt 
is going to start turning stories out 
in volume. It is to be hoped that 
this is so. I can hardly wait to read 
this third Null-A novel. On the 
basis of the two Null-A novels that 
are already out, it should be the 
longest of the three and the best. 
Have you any idea of when it will 
be out? — John Hoggatt, 3473 W. 
7th St., L.A., Calif. 

• VV's working on TV scripts, 
but will get back to the Null-A 
novel shortly. — Editor.
