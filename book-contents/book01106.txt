HERE ARE THE STARS 



this issue we’ve added 
’ ' a section on non-fiction 
science books to our review de- 
partment. But two recent books 
on astronomy seem to call for 
something more. They’re beauti- 
ful books! 

The first is a huge volume 
(and priced accordingly: $22.95!) 
called The FlammaTton Book of 
Astronomy (Simon 86 Schuster, 
Inc.). Its intent is simple: it cov- 
ers everything. 

Of course, the trouble with 
such a simple plan is that it is 
impossible. There is too much 
to cover. If you discuss quasers 
and the anomalous OH emissions 
from our galactic center, you just 
don’t have room to deal with 
Phobos’s peculiar orbit or the 
strange temperature readings on 
the portions of Jupiter’s surface 
shadowed by its moons. 

But astonishingly. The Flam- 
marion Book of Astronomy 
comes pretty close at that. It 
takes you everywhere from our 
own earth and moon out to dis- 
tant, receding galaxies, and back. 

Primarily intended for French- 
speaking people, even the trans- 



lation is a little Francophile, so 
that you will find much more at- 
tention paid to the observatory 
at Pic du Midi than to the one 
at Palomar. But it’s a fine book. 
If you had only one book on as- 
tronomy — this would be the book 
to have! 

ir?ven more beautiful as to il- 
lustrations is Beyond the 
Solar System (Viking). The text 
is first-rate too, of course — since 
it is our own Willy Ley. 

The illustrations are by Ches- 
ley Bonestell. Enough said! Just 
the captions will tell you what 
they are like: “Antares, a red 
supergiant, as viewed from a hy- 
pothetical inhabited planet.” 
“Mira Ceti.” And perhaps most 
wondrous of all: “The incredible 
system of Epsilon Aurigae” — a 
binary in which the main com- 
ponent is so huge and tenuous 
that is does not seem to glow at 
all. 

If you resound to the beauty 
of That Big Universe Out There 
— these books will set you 
thrumming like a guitar string!

COMMITTEE 
OF THE WHOLE 

by FRANK HERBERT 



Illustrated by NODEL 



The information could never be 
made public, no matter what — 
yet H could not be kept quiet! 



I 

\X7ith an increasing sense of 
^ ’’ unease, Alan Wallace stud- 
ied his client as they neared the 
public hearing room on the sec- 
ond floor of the Old Senate Of- 
fice Building. The guy was too 
relaxed. 

“Bill, I’m worried about this,” 



Wallace said. “You could damn 
well lose your grazing rights here 
in this room today.” 

They were almost into the 
gantlet of guards, reporters and 
TV cameramen before Wallace 
got his answer. 

“Who the hell cares?” Custer 
asked. 

Wallace, who prided himself 



6 



on being the Washington-type 
lawyer — above contamination 
by complaints and briefs, im- 
mune to all shock — found him- 
self tongue-tied with surprise. 

They were into the ruck then 
and Wallace had to pull on his 
bold face, smiling at the press, 
trying to soften the sharpness of 
that necessary phrase; 

“No comment. Sorry.” 

“See us after the hearing if 
you have any questions, gentle- 
men,” Custer said. 

The man’s voice was level 
and confident. 

He has himself over-controlled, 
Wallace thought. Maybe he was 
just joking ... a graveyard joke. 

The marble-walled hearing 
room blazed with lights. Camera 
platforms had been raised above 
the seats at the rear. Some of 
the smaller UHF stations had 
their cameramen standing on the 
window ledges. 

The subdued hubub of the 
place eased slightly, Wallace 
noted, then picked up tempo as 
William R. Custer — “The Bar- 
on of Oregon” they called him — 
entered with his attorney, passed 
the press tables and crossed to 
the seats reserved for them in 
the witness section. 

Ahead and to their right, that 
one empty chair at the long table 
stood waiting with its aura of 
complete exposure. 

“Who the hell cares?” 



That wasn’t a Custer-type 
joke, Wallace reminded himself. 
For all his cattle-baron pose, 
Custer held a doctorate in agri- 
culture and degrees in philoso- 
phy, math and electronics. HU 
western neighbors called him 
“The Brain”. 

It was no accident that the 
cattlemen had chosen him to 
represent them here. 

Wallace glanced covertly at 
tiie man, studying him. The cow- 
boy boots and string tie added 
to a neat dark business suit 
would have been affectation oa 
most men. They merely accented 
Custer’s good looks — the sun- 
burned, windblown outdoorsman. 
He was a little darker of hair 
and skin than his father had 
been, still light Miough to be 
called blonde, but not as ruddy 
and without the late father’s 
drink-tumescent veins. 

But then young Custer wasn’t 
quite thirty. 

Custer turned, met the at- 
torney’s eyes. He smiled. 

tt^'T^hose were good patent at- 
-*■ torneys you recommend- 
ed, Al,” Custer said. He lifted 
his briefcase to his lap, patted 
it. “No mincing around or mealy- 
mouthed excuses. Already got 
this thing on the way.” Again, 
he tapped the briefcase. 

He brought that damn’ light 
gadget here with him? Wallace 



COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

wondered. Why? He glanced at 
tile briefcase. Didn’t know it ivas 
that small . but maybe he’s 
fust talking about the plans for 
it. 

“Let’s keep our minds on this 
hearing,” Wallace whispered. 
“This is the only thing that’s im- 
portant.” 

Into a sudden lull in the room’s 
high noise level, the voice of 
•omeone in the press section 
carried across them : “greatest 
political show on earth.” 

“I brought this as an exhibit,” 
Custer said. Again, he tapped the 
briefcase. It did bulge oddly. 

Exhibit? Wallace asked him- 
self. 

It was the second time in ten 
minutes that Custer had shock- 
ed him. This was to be a hearing 
of a subcommittee of the Senate 
Interior and Insular Affairs Com- 
mittee. The issue was Taylor 
grazing lands. What the devil 
could that . gadget have to do 
with the battle of words and 
laws to be fought here? 

“You’re supposed to talk over 
all strategy with your attorney,” 
Wallace whispered. “What the 
devil do you . 

He broke off as the room fell 
suddenly silent. 

Wallace looked up to see the 
subcommittee chairman. Senator 
Haycourt Tiborough, stride 
through the wide double doors 
followed by his coterie of in- 



vestigators and attorneys. The 
senator was a tall man who had 
once been fat. He had dieted 
with such savage abruptness that 
his skin had never recovered. His 
jowls and the flesh on the back 
of his hands sagged. The top of 
his head was shiny bald and 
ringed by a three-quarter ton- 
sure that had purposely been 
allowed to grow long and strag- 
gly so that it fanned back over 
his ears. 

The senator was followed in 
close lock step by syndicated 
columnist Anthony Poxman who 
was speaking fiercely into Ti- 
borough’s left ear. TV cameras 
tracked the pair. 

If Poxman’s covering this one 
himself instead of sending a 
flunky, it’s going to be bad, Wal- 
lace told himself. 

Tiborough took his chair at 
the center of the committee table 
facing them, glanced left and 
right to assure himself the other 
members were present. 

Senator Spealance was absent, 
Wallace noted, but he had party 
organization difficulties at home, 
and the Senior Senator from 
OregcKi was, significantly, not 
present. Illness, it was reported. 

A sudden attack of caution, 
that common Washington mala- 
dy, no doubt. He knew where 
his campaign money came from 
. but he also knew where the 
votes were. 



8 



GALAXY 



They had a quorum, though. 

Tiborough cleared his throat, 
said : “The committee will please 
come to order.” 

'^he senator’s voice and man- 
ner gave Wallace a cold 
chill. We were nuts trying to 
fight this one in the open, he 
thought. Why’d I let Custer and 
his friends talk me into this? 
You can’t butt heads with a 
United States senator who’s out 
to get you. The only way’s to 
fight him on the inside. 

And now Custer suddenly 
turning screwball. 

Exhibit! 

“Gentlemen,” said Tiborough, 
“I think we can . that is, 
today we can dispense with pre- 
liminaries . unless my col- 
leagues ... if any of them have 
objections.” 

Again, he glanced at the other 
senators — five of them. Wallace 
swept his gaze down the line 
behind that table — Flowers of 
Nebraska (a horse trader), 
Johnstone of Ohio (a parliamen- 
tarian — devious). Lane of South 
Carolina (a Republican in De- 
mocrat disguise), Emery of Min- 
nesota (new and eager — dan- 
gerous because he lacked the old 
inhibitions) and Meltzer of New 
York (poker player, fine old 
family with traditions). 

None of them had objections. 

They’ve had a private meet- 

10 



ing — both sides of the aisle — 
and talked over a smooth steam- 
roller procedure, Wallace 
thought. 

It was another ominous sign. 

“This is a subcommittee of the 
United States Senate Committee 
on Interior and In,sular Affairs,” 
Tiborough said, his tone formal. 
“We are charged with obtaining 
expert opinion on proposed 
amendments to the Taylor Graz- 
ing Act of 1934. Today’s hearing 
will begin with testimony, and 
. , . ah, questioning of a man 
whose family has been in the 
business of raising beef cattle 
in Oregon for three generations.” 

Tiborough smiled at the TV 
cameras. 

The son-of-a-bitch is playing 
to the galleries, Wallace thought. 
He glanced at Custer. The cat- 
tleman sat relaxed against the 
back of his chair, eyes half lid- 
ded, staring at the senator. 

“We call as our first witness 
today Mr. William R. Custer of 
Bend, Oregon,” Tiborough said. 
“Will the clerk please swear in 
Mr. Custer.” 

Custer moved forward to the 
“hot seat”, placed his briefcase 
on the table. Wallace pulled a 
chair up beside his client, noted 
how the cameras turned as the 
derk stepped forward, put the 
Bible on the table and adminis- 
tered the oath. 

Tiborough ruffled through 
GALAXY 



some papers in front of him, wait- 
ed for full attention to return to 
him, said; “This subcommittee 
... we have before us a bill, this 
is a United States Senate Bill 
entitled SB-1024 of the current 
session, an act amending the 
Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 and, 
the intent is, as many have not- 
ed, that we would broaden the 
base of the advisory committees 
to tlie Act and include a wider 
public representation.” 

^'luster was fiddling with the 
'' clasp of his briefcase. 

How the hell could that light 
gadget be an exhibit here? Wal- 
lace asked himself. He glanced 
at the set of Custer’s jaw, noted 
the nervous working of a mus- 
cle. It was the first sign of un- 
ease he’d seen in Custer. The 
sight failed to settle Wallace’s 
own nerves. 

“Ah, Mr. Custer,” Tiborough 
said. “Do you — did you bring 
a preliminary statement? Your 
counsel . .” 

“I have a statement,” Custer 
said. His big voice rumbled 
through the room, requiring in- 
stant attention and the shift of 
cameras that had been holding 
tardily on Tiborough, expecting 
an addition to the question. 

Tiborough smiled, waited, 
then: “Your attorney — is your 
statement the one your counsel 
supplied the committee?” 



“With some slight additions 
of my own,” Custer said. 

Wallace felt a sudden qualm. 
They were too willing to accept 
Custer’s statement. He leaned 
close to his client’s ear, whisper- 
ed : “They know what your stand 
is. Skip the preliminaries.” 
Custer ignored him, said: “I 
intend to speak plainly and sim- 
ply. I oppose the amendment. 
Broaden the base and wider pub- 
lic representation are phases of 
political double talk. The intent 
is to pack the committees, to 
put control of them into the 
hands of people who don’t know 
the first thing about the cattle 
business and whose private in- 
tent is to destroy the Taylor 
Grazing Act itself.” 

“Plain, simple talk,” Tibor- 
ough said. “This committee . 
we welcome such directness. 
Strong words. A majority of this 
committee . we have taken the 
position that the public range 
lands have been too long sub- 
jected to the tender mercies of 
the stockmen advisors, that the 
lands . stockmen have exploit- 
ed them to their own advantage.” 
The gloves are off, Wallace 
thought. I hope Custer knows 
what he’s doing. He’s sure as 
hell not accepting advice. 

Custer pulled a sheaf of papers 
from his briefcase and Wallace 
glimpsed shiny metal in the case 
before the flap was closed. 



COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 



11 



Chrisi! That looked like a §un 
or something! 

Then Wallace recognized the 
papers — the brirf he and his 
staff had labored over — and the 
preliminary statement. He noted 
with alarm the penciled mark- 
ings and marginal notations. How 
could Custer have done that 
much to it in just twenty-four 
hours? 

Again, Wallace whispered in 
Custer’s ear: “Take it easy, Bill. 
The bastard’s out for blood.” 
Custer nodded to show he had 
heard, glanced at the papers, 
looked up directly at Tiborough. 

A hush settled on the room, 
broken only by the scraping of a 
chair somewhere in the rear, and 
the whirr of cameras. 

II 

<<T?irst, the nature of these 
-*■ lands we’re talking about,” 
Custer said. “In my state . 

He cleared his throat, a manner- 
ism that would have indicated 
anger in the old man, his father. 
There was no break in Custer’s 
expression, though, and his voice 
remained level. “. in my state, 
these were mostly Indian lands. 
This nation took them by brute 
force, right of conquest. That’s 
about the oldest right in the 
world, I guess. I don’t want to 
argue with it at this point.” 
“Mr. Custer.” 



It was Nebraska’s Senator 
Flowers, his amiable farmer’s 
face set in a tight grin. “Mr. 
Custer, I hope . .” 

“Is this a point of order?” 
Tiborough asked. 

“Mr. Chairman,” Flowers said, 
“I merely wished to make sure 
we weren’t going to bring up that 
old suggestion about giving these 
lands back to the Indians.” 
Laughter shot across the hear- 
ing room. Tiborough chuckled as 
he pounded his gavel for order, 
“You may continue, Mr. Cus- 
ter,” Tiborough said. 

Custer looked at Flowers, said: 
“No, Senator, I don’t want to 
give these lands back to the In- 
dians. When they had these 
lands, they only got about three 
hundred pounds of meat a year 
off eighty acres. We get five 
hundred pounds of the highest 
grade proteins — premium beef 
— from only ten acres.” 

“No one doubts the efficiency 
of your factory-like methods,” 
Tiborough said. “You can . 
we know your methods wring 
the largest amount of meat from 
a minimum acreage.” 

Ugh! Wallace thought. That 
was a low blow — implying BilFs 
overgrazing and destroying the 
land value. 

“My neighbors, the Warm 
Springs Indians, use the same 
methods I do,” Custer said. 
“They are happy to adopt our 



12 



GALAXY 



methods because we use the land 
while maintaining it and increas- 
ing its value. We don’t permit 
the land to fall prey to natural 
disasters such as fire and erosion. 
We don’t . .” 

“No doubt your methods are 
meticulously correct,” Tiborough 
said. “But I fail to see where . 

“Has Mr. Custer finished his 
preliminary statement yet?” Sen- 
ator Flowers cut in. 

Wallace shot a startled look at 
the Nebraskan. That was help 
from an unexpected quarter. 

“Thank you, Senator,” Custer 
said. “I’m quite willing to adapt 
to the Chairman’s methods and 
explain the meticulous correct- 
ness of my operation. Our low- 
liest cowhands are college men, 
highly paid. We travel ten times 
as many jeep miles as we do 
horse miles. Every outlying divi- 
sion of the ranch — every hold- 
ing pen and grazing supervisor’s 
cabin is linked to the central 
ranch by radio. We use the . .” 

“I concede that your methods 
must be the most modern in the 
world,” Tiborough said. “It’s 
not your methods as much as the 
results of these methods that are 
at issue here. We . 

TTe broke off at a disturbance 
by the door. An Army col- 
onel was talking to the guard 
there. He wore Special Services 
fouragere — Pentagon. 



Wallace noted v/ith an odd 
feeling of disquiet that the man 
was armed — a .45 at the hip. 
The weap>on was out of place on 
him, as though he had added it 
suddenly on an overpowering 
need . emergency. 

More guards were coming up 
outside the door now — Marines 
and Army. They carried rifles. 

The colonel said something 
sharp to the guard, turned away 
from him and entered the com- 
mittee room. All the cameras 
were tracking him now. He ig- 
nored them, crossed swiftly to 
Tiborough, and spoke to him. 

The senator shot a startled 
glance at Custer, accepted a 
sheaf of papers the colonel thrust 
at him. He forced his attention 
off Custer, studied the papers, 
leafing through them. Presently, 
he looked up, stared at Custer. 

A hush fell over the room. 

“I find myself at a loss. Mr. 
Custer,” Tiborough said. “I have 
here a copy of a report . it’s 
from the Special Services branch 
of the Army . through the 
Pentagon, you understand. It 
was just handed to me by, ah 
. the colonel here.” 

He looked up at the colonel 
who was standing, one hand rest- 
ing lightly on the bolstered .45. 
Tiborough looked back at Custer 
and it was obvious the senator 
was trying to marshall his 
thoughts. 



COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

“It is,” Tiborough said, “that 
is . this report supposedly . 
and I have every confidence it 
is what it is represented to be 
. here in my hands . they 
say that . uh, within the last, 
uh, few days they have, uh, in- 
vestigated a certain device . 
weapon they call it, that you are 
attempting to patent. They re- 
port . He glanced at the 
papers, back to Custer, who was 
staring at him steadily. “. this, 
uh, weapon, is a thing that . 
it is extremely dangerous.” 

“It is,” Custer said. 

“I . ah, see.” Tiborough 
cleared his throat, glanced up at 
the colonel who was staring fix- 
edly at Custer. The senator 
brought his attention back to 
Custer. 

“Do you in fact have such a 
weapon with you, Mr. Custer?” 
Tiborough asked. 

“I have brought it as an ex- 
hibit, sir.” 

“Exhibit?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Wallace rubbed his lips, found 
them dry. He wet them with his 
tongue, wished for the water 
glass, but it was beyond Custer. 
Christ! That stupid cowpuncher! 
He wondered if he dared whisper 
to Custer. Would the senators 
and that Pentagon lackey inter- 
pret such an action as meaning 
he was part of Custer’s crazy 
antics? 



“Are you threatening this com- 
mittee- with your weapon, Mr. 
Custer?” Tiborough asked. “If 
you are, I may say special pre- 
cautions have been taken . 
extra guards in this room and 
we . that is, we will not allow 
ourselves to worry too much 
about any action you may take, 
but ordinary precautions are in 
force.” 

allace could no longer sit 
quietly. He tugged Custer’s 
sleeve, got an abrupt shake of 
the head. He leaned close, whis- 
pered: “We could ask for a re- 
cess, Bill. Maybe we . .” 

“Don’t interrupt me,” Custer 
said. He looked at Tiborough. 
“Senator, I would not threaten 
you or any other man. Threats 
in the way you mean them are 
a thing we no longer can indulge 
in.” 

“You ... I believe you said 
this device is an exhibit,” Ti- 
borough said. He cast a worried 
frown at the report in his hands. 
“I fail ... it does not appear 
germane.” 

Senator Flowers cleared his 
throat. “Mr. Chairman,” he said. 

“The chair recognizes the sen- 
ator from Nebraska,” Tiborough 
said, and the relief in his voice 
was obvious. He wanted time to 
think. 

“Mr. Custer,” Flowers said, “I 
have not seen the report, the 




14 



GALAXY 



report my distinguished col- 
league alludes to; however, if I 
may ... is it your wish to use 
this committee as some kind of 
publicity device?” 

“By no means, Senator,” Cus- 
ter said. “I don’t wish to profit 
by my presence here . not at 
all.” 

Tiborough had apparently 
come to a decision. He leaned 
back, whispered to the colonel, 
who nodded and returned to the 
outer hall. 

“You strike me as an eminent- 
ly reasonable man, Mr. Custer,” 
Tiborough said. “If I may . .” 
“May I,” Senator Flowers 
said. “May I, just permit me to 
conclude this one point. May we 
have the Special Services report 
in the record?” 

“Certainly,” Tiborough said. 
“But what I was about to sug- 
gest . .” 

“May I,” Flowers said. “May 
I, would you permit me, please, 
Mr. Chairman, to make this 
point clear for the record?” 
Tiborough scowled, but the 
heavy dignity of the Senate over- 
came his irritation. “Flease con- 
tinue, Senator. I had thought you 
were finished.” 

“I respect . there is no 
doubt in my mind of Mr. Cus- 
ter’s truthfulness,” Flowers said. 
His face eased into a grin that 
made him look grandfatherly, a 
kindly elder statesman. “I would 



like, therefore, to have him es-‘ 
plain how this ... ah, weapon, 
can be an exhibit in the matter 
before our committee.” 

Wallace glanced at Custei, 
saw the hard set to the man’* 
jaw, realized the cattleman had 
gotten to Flowers somehovs. 
This was a set piece. 

Tiborough was glancing at the 
other senators, weighing the ad- 
visability of high-handed dismis- 
sal . perhaps a star chamber 
session. No . they were all toe 
curious about Custer’s device^ 
his purpose here. 

The thoughts were plain on 
the senator’s face. 

“Very well,” Tiborough said 
He nodded to Custer. “You may 
proceed, Mr. Custer.” 

tiT~\uring last winter’s slack 
season,” Custer said, 
“two of my men and I worked’ 
on a project we’ve had in the 
works for three years — to de- 
velop a sustained-emission laser 
device.” 

Custer opened his briefcase, 
slid out a fat aluminum tube 
mounted on a pistol grip with s. 
conventional appearing trigger. 

“This is quite harmless,” he 
said. “I didn’t bring the power 
pack.” 

“That is . this is your wea- 
pon?” Tiborough asked. 

“Calling this a weapon is mis- 
leading,” Custer said. “The term 



COMMITTEE OF THE WHOtE

limits and oversimplifies. This is 
also a brush-cutter, a substitute 
for a logger’s saw and axe, a 
diamond cutter, a milling ma- 
chine . and a weapon. It is 
also a turning point in history.” 
“Come now, isn’t that a bit 
pretentious?” Tiborough asked. 

“We tend to think of history 
as something old and slow,” 
Custer said. “But history is, as 
a matter of fact, extremely rapid 
and immediate. A President is 
assassinated, a bomb explodes 
over a city, a dam break, a re- 
volutionary device is announced.” 
“Lasers have been known for 
quite a few years,” Tiborough 
said. He looked at the papers 
the colonel had given him. “The 
principle dates from 1956 or 
thereabouts.” 

“I don’t wish it to appear that 
I’m taking credit for inventing 
this device,” Custer said. “Nor 
am I claiming sole credit for 
developing the sustained-emis- 
sion laser. I was merely one of 
a team. But I do hold the device 
here in my hand, gentlemen.” 
“Exhibit, Mr. Custer,” Flowers 
reminded him. “How is this an 
exhibit?” 

“May I explain first how it 
works?” Custer asked. “That will 
make the rest of my statement 
much easier.” 

''T^iborough looked at Flowers, 
^ back to Custer. “If you will 



tie this all together, Mr. Custer,” 
Tiborough said. “I want to . » 
the bearing of this device on our 
— we are hearing a particular 
bill in this room.” 

“Certainly, Senator,” Custer 
said. He looked at his device. “A 
ninety-volt radio battery drives 
this particular model. We have 
some tliat require less voltage, 
some that use more. We aimed 
for a 'construction with simple 
parts. Our crystals are common 
quartz. We shattered them by 
bringing them to a boil in water 
and then plunging them into ice 
water . repeatedly. We chose 
twenty pieces of very close to 
the same size — about one gram, 
slightly more than fifteen grains 
each.” 

Custer unscrewed the back of 
the tube, slid out a round lengtii 
of plastic trailing lengths of red, 
green, brown, blue and yellow 
wire. 

Wallace noted how the cam- 
eras of the TV men centered on 
the object in Custer’s hands. 
Even the senators were leaning 
forward, staring. 

We’re gadget crazy people, 
Wallace thought. 

“The crystals were dipped in 
thinned household cement and 
then into iron filings,” Custer 
said. “We made a little jig out 
of a fly-tying vice and opened 
a passage in the filings at op- 
posite ends of the crystals. We 



16 



GALAXY 



then made some common cellu- 
loid — nitrocellulose, acetic acid, 
gelatin and alcohol — all very 
common products, and formed it 
in a length of garden hose just 
long enough to take the crystals 
end to end. The crystals were 
inserted in the hose, the cellu- 
loid poured over them and the 
whole thing was seated in a 
magnetic waveguide while the 
celluloid was cooling. This cen- 
tered and aligned the crystals. 
The waveguide was constructed 
from wire salvaged from an old 
TV set and built following the 
directions in the Radio Ama- 
teur’s Handbook.” 

Custer re-inserted the length 
of plastic into the tube, adjusted 
the wires. There was an unearth- 
ly silence in the room with only 
the cameras whirring. It was as 
though everyone were holding 
his breath. 

“A laser requires a resonant 
cavity, but that’s complicated,” 
Custer said. “Instead, we wound 
two layers of fine copper wire 
around our tube, immersed it in 
the celluloid solution to coat it 
and then filed one end flat. This 
end took a piece of mirror cut 
to fit. We then pressed a num- 
ber eight embroidery needle at 
right angles into the mirror end 
of the tube until it touched the 
side of the number one crystal.” 

Custer cleared his throat. 

Two of the senators leaned

back. Flowers coughed. Tibor- 
ough glanced at the banks of TV 
cameras and there was a ques- 
tioning look in his eyes. 

then determined the 
’ ’ master frequency of our 
crystal series,” Custer said. “We 
used a test signal and oscillo- 
scope, but any radio amateur 
could do it without the oscillo- 
scope. We constructed an oscilla- 
tor of that master frequency, at- 
tached it at tile needle and a 
bare spot scraped in the opposite 
edge of the waveguide.” 

“And this . ah . worked?” 
Tiborough asked. 

“No.” Custer shook his head. 
‘When we fed power through a 
voltage multiplier into the sys- 
tem we produced an estimated 
four hundred joules emission and 
melted half the tube. So we 
started all over again.” 

“You are going to tie this in?” 
Tiborough asked. He frowned at 
the papers in his hands, glanced 
toward the door where the col- 
onel had gone. 

“I am, sir, believe me,” Custer 
said. 

“Very well, then,” Tiborough 
said. 

“So we started all over,” Cus- 
ter said. “But for the second cel- 
luloid dip we added bismuth — a 
saturate solution, actually. It 
stayed gummy and we had to 
paint over it with a sealing coat 



of the straight cdluloid. We then 
coupled this bismuth layer 
through a pulse circuit so that it 
was bathed in a counter wave — 
180 degrees out of phase with 
the master frequency. We had, 
in effect, immersed the unit in a 
thermoelectric cooler that exact- 
ly countered the heat production. 
A thin beam issued from the un- 
mirrored end when we powered 
it. We have yet to find some- 
thing that thin beam cannot 
cut.” 

“Diamonds?” Tiborough ask- 
ed. 

“Powered by less than two 
hundred volts, this device could 
cut our planet in half like a 
ripe tomato,” Custer said. “One 
man could destroy an aerial ar- 
mada with it, knock down IC- 
BMs before they touched atmo- 
sphere, sink a fleet, pulverize a 
city. I’m afraid, sir, that I haven’t 
mentally catalogued all the vio- 
lent implications of this device. 
The mind tends to boggle at the 
enormous power focused in . .” 

“Shut down those TV cam- 
eras!” 

It was Tiborough shouting, 
leaping to his feet and making 
a sweeping gesture to include 
the banks of cameras. The ab- 
rupt violence of his voice and 
gesture fell on the room like an 
explosion. “Guards!” he called. 
“You there at the door. Cordon 
off that door and don’t let any- 



18 



GALAXY 



one out who heard this fool!” He 
whirled back to face Custer. 
“You irresponsible idiot!” 

“I’m afraid, Senator,” Custer 
said, “that you’re locking the 
bam door many weeks too late.” 
For a long minute of silence 
Tiborough glared at Custer. 
Then: “You did this deliberately, 
eh?” 

Ill 

ttCenator, if I’d waited any 
^ longer, there might have 
been no hope for us at all.” 
Tiborough sat back into his 
chair, still keeping his attention 
fastened on Custer. Flowers and 
Johnston on his right had their 
heads close together whispering 
fiercely. The other senators were 
dividing their attention between 
Custer and Tiborough, their eyes 
wide and with no attempt to 
conceal their astonishment. 

Wallace, growing conscious of 
the implications in what Ciister 
had said, tried to wet his Ups 
with his tongue. Christ! he 
thought. This stupid cowpoke 
has sold us all down the river! 

Tiborough signaled an aide, 
spoke briefly with him, beckon- 
ed the colonel from the door. 
There was a buzzing of excited 
conversation in the room. Sev- 
eral of the press and TV crew 
were huddled near the windows 
on Custer’s left, arguing. One of 



their number — a florid-faced 
man with gray hair and horn- 
rimmed glasses, started across 
the room toward Tiborough, was 
stopped by a committee aide. 
They began a low-voiced argu- 
ment with violent gestures. 

A loud curse sounded from the 
door. Poxman, the syndicated 
columnist, was trying to push 
past the guards there. 

“Poxman!” Tiborough called. 
The columnist turned. “My or- 
ders are that no one leaves,” 
Tiborough said. “You are not an 
exception.” He turned back to 
face Custer. 

The room had fallen into a 
semblance of quiet, although 
there still were pockets of mut- 
tering and there was the sound 
of running feet and a hurrying 
about in the hall outside. 

“Two channels went out of 
here live,” Tiborough said. 
“Nothing much we can do about 
them, although we will trace 
down as many of their viewers 
as we can. Every bit of film in 
this room and evgry sound tape 
will be confiscated, however.” 
His voice rose as protests sound- 
ed from the press section. “Our 
national security is at stake. The 
President has been notified. Such 
measures as are necessary will 
be taken.” 

The colonel came hurrying 
into the room, crossed to Tibor- 
ough, quietly said something. 



COMMIHEE OF THE WHOIE

“You should’ve warned me!” 
Tiborough snapped. “I had no 
idea that . 

The colonel interrupted with 
a whispered comment. 

“These papers . your damn- 
ed report is not clear!” Tibor- 
ough said. He looked around at 
Custer. “I see you’re smiling, 
Mr. Custer. I don’t think you’ll 
find much to smile about before 
long.” 

“Senator, this is not a happy 
smile,” Custer said. “But I told 
myself several days ago you’d 
fail to see the implications of 
this thing.” He tapped the pistol- 
shaped device he had rested on 
the table. “I told myself you’d 
fall back into the old, useless pat- 
tern.” 

CcTs that what you told your- 
self, really?” Tiborough 

said. 

Wallace, hearing the venom in 
the senator’s voice, moved his 
chair a few inches farther away 
from Custer. 

Tiborough kx>ked at the laser 
projector. ‘Ts that Ihing really 
disarmed ?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“If I order one of my men to 
take it from you, you will not 
resist?” 

“Which of your men will you 
trust with it. Senator?” Custer 
asked. 

In the long silence that fol- 



lowed, someone in the press sec- 
tion emitted a nervous guffaw. 

“Virtually every man on my, 
ranch has one of these things,” 
Custer said. “We fell trees with 
them, cut firewood, make fence 
posts. Every letter written to me 
as a result of my patent applica- 
tion has been answered candidly. 
More than a thousand sets of 
schematics and instructions on 
how to build this device have 
been sent out to varied places 
in the world.” 

“You vicious traitor!” Tibor- 
ough rasped. 

“You’re certainly entitled to 
your opinion. Senator,” Custer 
said. “But I warn you I’ve had 
time for considerably more con- 
centrated and considerably more 
painful thought than you’ve ap- 
plied to this problem. In my 
estimation, I had no choice. 
Every week I waited to make 
this thing public, every day, 
every minute, merely rai.sed the 
odds that humanity would be 
destroyed by . .” 

“You said this thing applied 
to the hearings on the graidng 
act,” Flowers protested, and 
there was a plaintive note of 
complaint in his voice. 

“Senator, I told you the truth,” 
Custer said. “There’s no real 
reason to change the act, now. 
We intend to go on operating 
under it — with the agreement 
of our neighbors and others con- 



20 



GALAXY 



cemed. People are still going to 
need food.” 

Tiborough glared at him. 
"You’re saying we can’t force 
you to . .” He broke off at a 
disturbance in the doorway. A 
rope barrier had been stretched 
there and a line of Marines 
stood with their backs to it, fac- 
ing the hall. A mob of people 
was trying to press through. Press 
cards were being waved. 

“Colonel, I told you to clear 
that hall!” Tiborough barked. 

The colonel ran to the barrier. 
“Use your bayonets if you have 
to!” he shouted. 

The disturbance subsided at 
the sound of his voice. More uni- 
formed men could be seen mov- 
ing in along the barrier. Pre- 
sently, the noise receded. 



'^iborough turned back to 
Custer. “You make Benedict 
Arnold look like the greatest 
friend the United States ever 
had,” he said. 

“Cursing me isn’t going to help 
you,” Custer said. “You are 
going to have to live with this 
tiring: so you’d better try under- 
standing it.” 

“That appears to be simple,” 
Tiborough said. “All I have to 
do is send twenty-five cents to 
the Patent office for the sche- 
matics and then write you a 
letter.” 

“The world already was head- 



ed toward suicide,” Custer said. 
“Only fools failed to realize . 

“So you decided to give us a 
little push,” Tiborough said. 

“H. G. Wells warned us,” 
Custer said. “That’s how far back 
it goes, but nobody listened. 
‘Human history becomes more 
and more a race between educa- 
tion and catastrophe,’ Wells said. 
But those were just words. Many 
scientists have remarked the 
growth curve on the amount of 
raw energy becoming available 
to humans — and the diminish- 
ing curve on the number of per- 
sons required to use that energy. 
For a long time now, more and 
more violent power was being 
made available to fewer and few- 
er people. It was only a matter 
of time until total destruction 
was put into the hands of single 
individuals.” 

“And you didn’t think you 
could take your government into 
your confidence.” 

“The government already was 
committed to a political course 
diametrically opposite the one 
this device requires,” Custer 
said. “Virtually every man in 
the government has a vested in- 
terest in not reversing that 
course.” 

“So you set yourself above the 
government?” 

“I’m probably wasting my 
time,” Custer said, “but I’ll try 
to explain it. Virtually every 



COMMIHEE OF THE WHOtE 



21 



government in the world is dedi- 
cated to manipulating something 
called the ‘mass man’. That’s 
how governments have stayed in 
power. But there is no such man. 
When you elevate the non-exis- 
tent ‘mass man’ you degrade the 
individual. And obviously it was 
only a matter of time until all 
ot us were at the mercy of the 
individual holding power.” 

“You talk like a commie!” 
“They’ll say I’m a goddamn’ 
capitalist pawn,” Custer said. 
“Let me ask you, Senator, to 
visualize a poor radio technician 
in a South American country. 
Brazil, for example. He lives a 
hand-to-mouth existence, ground 
down by an overbearing, un- 
imaginative, essentially uncouth 
ruling oligarchy. What is he going 
to do when this device comes 
into his hands?” 

4 4 IV /f urder, robbery and an- 
^ archy.” 

“You could be right,” Custer 
said. “But we might reach an 
understanding out of ultimate 
necessity — that each of us must 
cooperate in maintaining the dig- 
nity of all.” 

Tiborough stared at him, be- 
gan to speak musingly: “We’ll 
have to control the essential ma- 
terials for constructing this thing 
. and there may be trouble 
for awhile, but . .” 

“You’re a vicious fool.” 



In the cold silence that follow- 
ed, Custer said: “It was too late 
to try that ten years ago. I’m 
telling you this thing can be 
patchworked out of a wide va- 
riety of materials that are al- 
ready scattered over the earth. 
It can be made in basements and 
mud huts, in palaces and shacks. 
The key item is the crystals, but 
other crystals will work, too. 
That’s obvious. A patient man 
can grow crystals . and this 
world is full of patient men.” 
“I’m going to place you under 
arrest,” Tiborough said. “You 
have outraged every rule — ” 
“You’re living in a dream 
world,” Custer said. “I refuse 
to threaten you, but I’ll defend 
myself from any attempt to op- 
press or degrade me. If I cannot 
defend myself, my friends will 
defend me. No man who under- 
stands what this device means 
will permit his dignity to be tak- 
en from him.” 

Custer allowed a moment for 
his words to sink in, then: “And 
don’t twist those words to imply 
a threat. Refusal to threaten a 
fellow human is an absolute re- 
quirement in the day that haa 
just dawned on us.” 

“You haven’t changed a thing!” 
Tiborough raged. “If one man is 
powerful with that thing, a hun- 
dred are . .” 

“All previous insults aside,” 
Custer said, “I think you are a 



22 



GALAXY 



highly intelligent man, Senator. 
I ask you to think long and hard 
about tliis device. Use of power 
is no longer the deciding factor 
because one man is as powerful 
as a million. Restraint — se/f- 
restraint is now the key to sur- 
vival. Each of us is at the mercy 
of his neighbor’s good will. Each 
of us, Senator — the man in the 
palace and the man in the shack. 
We’d better do all we can to 
increase that good will — not at- 
tempting to buy it, but simply 
recognizing that individual digni- 
ty is the one inalienable right 
of . 

“Don’t you preach at me, you 
commie traitor!” Tiborough rasp- 
ed. “You’re a living example 
of . .” 

“Senator!” 

It was one of the TV camera- 
men in the left rear of the room. 

“Let’s stop insulting Mr. Cus- 
ter and hear him out,” the cam- 
eraman said. 

“Get that man’s name,” Ti- 
borough told an aide. “If he . .” 

“I’m an expert electronic tech- 
nician, Senator,” the man said. 
“You can’t threaten me now.” 

/duster smiled, turned to face 
Tiborough. 

“The revolution begins,” Cus- 
ter said. He waved a hand as the 
senator started to whirl away. 
“Sit down, Senator.” 

Wallace, watching the senator 



obey, saw how the balance of 
control had changed in this room. 

“Ideas are in the wind,” Cus- 
ter said. “There comes a time for 
a thing to develop. It comes 
into being. The spinning jenny 
came into being because that was 
its time. It was based on count- 
less ideas that had preceded it. " 

“And this is the age of the 
laser?” Tiborough asked. 

“It was bound to come,” Cus- 
ter said. “But the number of pr-o- 
ple in the world who’re fihed 
with hate and frustration and 
violence has been growing with 
terrible speed. You add to that 
the enormous danger that this 
might fall into the hands of just 
one group or naticwi or . .” 
Custer shrugged. “This is too 
much power to be confined to 
one man or group with the hope 
they’ll administer wisely. I didn’t 
dare delay. That’s why I spread 
this thing now and announced it 
as broadly as I could.” 

Tiborough leaned back in his 
chair, his hands in his lap. His 
face was pale and beads of per- 
spiration stood out on his fore- 
head. 

“We won’t make it.” 

“I hope you’re wrong. Sena- 
tor,” Custer said. “But the only 
thing I know for sure is that 
we’d have had less chance of 
making it tomorrow than we 
have today.”

Wrong -Wav Street 

by LARRY NIVEN 



What was the ancient alien 
ship on Earth's Moon? What 
had happened to its people? 



■jyyTike Capoferri turned out to 
be at one time in his life 
the loneliest man on the Moon. 
But it was not his first venture 
into aloneness. He had felt it 
before, almost twenty years be- 
fore, when he was twelve and 
his eight-year-old brother died. 

Young Tony had been riding 
a Flexy, a kind of bobsled on 
wheels, down the hill road above 
Venice Boulevard. At the bottom 
of the hill he had turned hard 
right onto Venice. The Flexy 
had flipped over on its back, and 
its blunt rubber handle had pok- 
ed hard into Tony’s stomach. 

One of the first things the 
doctor did was to take Tony’s 



blood pressure. It was low, which 
meant shock. It started to fall 
almost as soon as the blood pres- 
sure cuff was removed, but the 
doctor didn’t know that until it 
was too late. Tony’s spleen was 
ruptured. 

Mike had loved his younger 
brother. He sat in his room most 
of the time, unable to get used 
to his loss, and not really trying. 
After four weeks of it his father 
neglected his own grief long 
enough to take Mike to a child 
psychologist. 

Mike was a recent but ardent 
science-fiction fan. “I want to 
change it. Doctor Stuart,” he said 
earnestly. “I want to go back to 



24 



four weeks ago and take away 
Tony’s Flexy.” He meant it, of 
course. 

Doctor Stuart had worked hard 
to get Mike to say those words. 
If he was thinking in terms of 
sibling rivalries and guilt fed- 
ings, it didn’t show. “You can’t 
do that, Mike. Time is a one- 
way street with no parking 
spaces. You just have to keep 
going.” 

“Until you have an accident,” 
Mike said bitterly. 

Doctor Stuart nodded. “Or run 
out of gas,” he added, because 
he himself was old enough for the 
analogy to apply. They talked 
for almost three hours, with Mike 
doing most of the talking. After- 
wards Mike gradually stopped 
mourning. 

X T^hen Mike Capoferri gradu- 

’ ^ ated from high school he 
had become intensely interested 
in space travel. His first year at 
Cal Tech was the year Walnikov 
landed on Mars. Mike was deter- 
mined to follow. 

In a way he traveled further 
than Walnikov. He never got to 
Mars, but he did make it to the 
Moon. And unlike Mars, the 
Moon once had intelligent visi- 
tors. 

Mike was one of many. Thirty 
men and women had come to 
the alien base, determined to 
probe all its secrets. By this time 



Mike was thirty-one years old 
and held doctorates in physics, 
mathematics and philosophy. He 
was tall, dark, not too homely, a 
little too earnest. He got over 
that at the base, where the only 
defense against strangeness was 
a sense of humor. 

Besides the base, the aliens 
had thoughtfully provided one 
spaceship. It rested on its side 
near the base, a fat cylinder with 
conical «ids and asymmetrical 
bulges in unexpected places. 
Mike began going through the 
ship before he ever entered the 
base, and he kept at it through 
the years. This wasn’t unusual. 
The ship was thought to be the 
real treasure, for its star charts 
showed (in hard-to-read nota- 
tions in ultraviolet ink) that it 
had cruised between widely se- 
parated stars. It may have had 
a faster-than-light drive. 

The base personnel lived in 
the base itself, with their own 
air regenerating system and their 
own airlock built into the open 
alien airlock. There was plenty 
of room for them. The aliens 
had averaged ten feet tall, and 
there were things which must 
have been bunks for forty- eight 
of them. 

Still, the base took getting used 
to. The alien engineers had put 
steps and ledges in the floor 
wherever the ground beneath 
wasn’t exactly level. Newcomers

leetrned to walk with bowed 
heads to avoid stubbed toes. 
They learned not to sit on the 
Tsunks,’ which looked like pieces 
of free-form sculpture, felt like 
foam rubber with a metal core, 
and changed shape without 
warning. They were told not to 
touch mosaic designs which had 
been marked with paint, for the 
design might hide a control sur- 
face of some kind. 

I t was four years since Mike 
had landed on the Moon. In 
that time the human tenants had 
made a great deal of progress. 

An emergency repair kit from 
the ship had yielded a method of 
creating artificial crystals of al- 
most any shape from almost any 
solid, by building them up atom 
by atom. Already ships had lifted 
on rocket motors built from large 
diamonds. 

A box which held perfectly 
preserved sections from some 
non-terrestrial animals, possibly 
used as food, had given them a 
field which would interrupt any 
chemical process. The applica- 
tions were numerous and varied. 
A short-range death ray. A beam 
to fight forest fires. A new meth- 
od of inducing suspended anima- 
tion, very useful in surgery. 

A sculpting implement, used 
by the aliens as a means of re- 
creation (the base was infested 
with the statues they had left 

26 



behind), had become a disinte- 
grator. Turning it on had been 
heartbreakingly difficult. Mike 
had solved that problem in his 
second year, but had never been 
able to turn it off. The alien 
rec room had to be kept in va- 
cuo, with a separate airlock, be- 
cause air disappeared into the 
little ball of nothing at the end 
of the sculpting tool. 

Enough progress had been 
made on the alien number sys- 
tem that it was possible to do 
calculus with it. The money sys- 
tem, however, remained a com- 
plete mystery. 

Aside from the crystal maker 
and the airlock controls, the ship 
was as great and as fascinating 
an enigma as ever. The rows of 
‘bunks’ near the back — suppose 
a bunk changed shape and 
dumped its occupant during a 
5G maneuver? The controls, in 
plain sight on a common-sense 
control board in the bunk sec- 
tion — what did it take to make 
them work? And what was the 
purpose of the dull red tetra- 
hedron, seven feet on a side, 
which was set in the rear wall 
of the passenger section? 

Mike was taking a coffee 
break with Terry Holmes, a pret- 
ty, cheerful, blonde little Doctor 
of Languages, the day he first 
said, “I think I know what the 
central pyramid is for.” 

Many people had said that, of 

GALAXY 



course, but Mike was not ad- 
dicted to wild guesses. “What 
is it?” Terry asked eagerly. 

“It’s a time machine,” he said. 

Terry got mad and left the 
table. The Halloween before 
Mike had dressed to imitate an 
alien statue and had frightening- 
ly ‘come to life’ before her hor- 
rified eyes. Since then she had 
been sensitive about his jokes. 

“No, really,” he told her dur- 
ing the afternoon coffee break. 
“The idea makes a great deal of 
sense. We can be sure that the 
aliens had suspended animation, 
can’t we?” 

“Sure.” The reaction damping 
field was perfect for that pur- 
pose. 

“Right. So if they had time 
travel to go with it, it adds up 
to an FTL drive. They can sleep 
through a hundred-year journey 
and then move back a hundred 
years.” 

“You’re only guessing,” Terry 
told him. “If the pyramid is an 
interstellar drive they didn’t need 
time travel. If they had suspend- 
ed animation they could have 
spent generations on one trip. 
We’ll have to do that ourselves, 
probably.” 

“Sure, but the idea of a time- 
travel device in the center of a 
spaceship is at least logical. I’ve 
been working on the thing for 
quite a while, and I think that’s 
what it is. I’ve made it produce 



a weak gravitational field, so I 
know it can distort four-space.” 

“Then it’s for artificial gravi- 
ty.” She laughed as his face fell. 
“Mike, I dub thee world’s cham- 
pion rationalizer. And now I’ve 
got to get back to work.” 

For a month nothing impor- 
tant happened. Carlos found a 
way to turn on the alien tele- 
vision set and got three-dimen- 
sional, technicolor static. Terry 
made some progress with the 
alien money ; she had a tentative 
ordering of coins into either 
ascending or descending value, if 
in fact they were coins. 

Then one day the ship dis- 
appeared. 

TVyrike was trying something 
new. He had set up a mag- 
netic field around the control 
board and pushed one of the 
pyramid knobs. There were two 
of these, the same shape and 
color as the massive machine be- 
hind him. Now he put a block 
of glass between the poles of his 
generator and cut the current. 
The knob lit with an almost in- 
visible blue glow. Suddenly ev- 
erything was in free fall. 

“Eureka,” Mike said absently, 
meaning; at last I’ve gotten some 
action out of the beast. When he 
turned his head he saw that the 
big red tetrahedron was base for- 
ward. He’d heard no sound of 
motion. 



WRONG-WAY STREET 



27 



A taint purple line grew across 
the top of the board. 

There were too many un- 
knowns crawling into his experi- 
ment. Mike looked back so that 
he could see the big pyramid 
turn around, and switched his 
generator back on. Results came 
instantly. 

Mike sat up trying to rub the 
pain out of his eyes. It was sev- 
eral seconds before he could open 
them. 

The pyramid was apex-forward 
again. Mike got up and pulled 
out the pyramid knob, waited a 
moment for luck, then turned off 
the field generator. At last he sat 
down perspiring on an alien 
“bunk’. What a sight that had 
been! He couldn’t even remem- 
ber it without his eyes hurting. 

Mike’s bunk inconsiderately 
dropped him on the floor. He 
promptly got up and made for 
the airlock, feeling a crying need 
for coffee, Terry Holmes, con- 
versation and familiar things. 
The strangeness had suddenly 
become too much to take. 

His momentary fear of the 
ship was gone by the time he 
left the airlock. What had start- 
ed it, anyway? Merely the fact 
that he’d gotten things to work- 
ing at last. Now they could make 
some real progress. 

He moved toward the base in 
easy four-foot leaping strides 
which splashed waves of dust 



when he landed. He was looking 
straight at the base airlock, but 
he was preoccupied by the 
thought of coffee and the famil- 
iar, instantly suppressed wish for 
a cigarette. He was half-way 
there before he noticed . 

The base airlock was closed. 
The alien airlock! 

Mike stopped short, staring. 
At first he was only bewildered, 
not horrified. How could the 
doors have closed? The bulk of 
the U N airlock would have 
stopped them. Or was the alien 
tnetal strong enough to — 

Mike made a strangling noise. 
The human airlock must have 
been crushed flat! 

He ran. 

I t had taken the base team 
months to open those doors. 
Although Mike had arrived a 
year later, he knew how they 
had done it. But why had they 
closed it? Had some fool been 
meddling with the controls? 

With alien designing, practi- 
cally anything could be a con- 
trol. The aliens had cleverly hid- 
den their knobs, buttons, and 
pressure sensitive surfaces in 
esthetically pleasing designs. The 
doors could have been closed by 
somebody accidentally leaning 
against a wall. Nobody had ever 
bothered to find out how to open 
them from the inside. 

Mike began picking pressure 



28 



GALAXY 



points out of the mosaic on the 
outer door. He stopped to won- 
der if the base held air, then 
decided that it didn’t matter. 
Anyone still alive would be 
wearing a spacesuit under emer- 
gency regulations. 

He was taking a breather 
when he noticed that the UN 
ship was gone. 

Had they started to evacuate 
the base? No, the ship only held 
four people and cargo. They 
must have gone for help. 

The lock had been designed 
for use by two ten-footers with 
fourteen-foot branched tentacles. 
Mike needed forty minutes and 
a great deal of ingenuity, but 
finally the lock swung open. 

There was no wreckage in the 
lock. 

“Dust,” Mike told himself. 
There was almost no moondust 
on the worn path between the 
ship and the base. Yet dust had 
spurted beneath his boots . 
and there was no Earth-built 
ship, and the station was locked. 

“Eureka,” he said softly. “They 
haven’t found the base yet. I’ve 
traveled in time.” 

Yet there were other possibili- 
ties. Mike began seeking them 
out even as he was going to work 
on the inner door. Maybe he had 
gone forward in time, to when 
the base had been restored as 
a museum. Or, worse yet, to some 
time after the return of the legi- 



timate owners. (That naa once 
been a favorite joke around the 
base: ‘Hey, look, they’re coming 
back!’) He might even be in an- 
other time track, one in which 
the base had never been aban- 
doned. After all, he really didn’t 
know much about the machine 
he’d been running. 

One look through a telescope 
would have told all. He could 
see the Earth from where he 
was standing, huge and full, but 
of course, he could not make out 
the shapes of the continents. 

He kept working. 

He was rigidly tensed as the 
doors folded back. Had the sta- 
tion been abandoned yet? Was 
his the honor, God help him, of 
meeting the first inhuman intel- 
ligence? But nobody came to 
meet him. 

His air pressure dial read 22.4 
pounds/square inch. This must 
be alien air. 

T Te walked through the base, 
^ -*■ slowly and cautiously; after 
four and a half years he was 
used to v/atching where he step- 
ped. The base was like a haunted 
house. There was an air of 
strangeness here that he had 
never known before, not even 
when he had first come. Not 
Commander Link Day of UN 
Flight Four, but Mike Capoferri, 
was the first man to set foot in 
this place. 



WRONG-WAY STREET 



29 



Could he get back? Sure he 
could. The other button must be 
the one that controlled flight 
into the future. 

But even then, he might not 
be able to tell anyone. 

Hey, he told himself proudly, 
Fm a time traveler! Wait here, 
he answered solicitiously, /’// call 
the medic. No, he protested, I 
can prove it. Get in the ship and 
I'll show you. But that could go 
wrong in a dozen ways. He’d 
' want to know more about what 
he was doing before he tried 
this again. 

Kilroy was here, he thought 

If he left marks of his visit, 
they would still be here when 
he returned to his own time. He 
could scratch his initials — hmm. 

He turned right. When he 
reached the rec room he went 
to one of the sculpting machines 
and began to take it apart. 

The tool itself looked like a 
big, fat mechanical pencil. It was 
set in a brace which could be 
moved to any part of the work. 
The brace allowed the tool to 
move freely under pressure and 
held it steady otherwise. The 
pointed business end of the tool 
generated a sphere of emptiness 
into which matter vanished 
without trace. 

Removing the tool from the 
brace was almost easy. Turning 
it on took just under an hour. 
Once Mike almost gave up the 



idea, but he kept at it, for he 
had nothing else which would 
mar any of the indestructible 
materials used to build the base. 

He held the device like a pen- 
cil, but more carefully. His first 
thought had been to put a por- 
trait of Commander Link Day 
on the statue of an alien female 
in the bunk room. He’d changed 
his mind. It would be dangerous 
and stupid to change his own 
past. He had to do something 
which would not be discovered 
before he arrived at the base, in 
1985. 

The inner side of the outer 
door would be a good place to 
hide a carving, because nobody 
had ever seen it. It folded against 
the airlock wall when the lock 
was open. 

A wind blew toward his hand 
as he walked. There must be a 
way to shut air out of the dis- 
integrator, but he hadn’t the time 
to find it. He couldn’t remem- 
ber whether the team had found 
air in the base. If they had, he 
was changing the past right now. 

What should he write? ‘The 
world is my ash tray’, he decided, 
and slammed his toe into a ledge. 
He threw both hands out to 
break his fall, and changed his 
mind too late. Horrified, he 
watched the sculpting pencil 
vanish into the floor. It left a 
neat cylindrical hole. 

Well, Mike thought furiously. 



30 



GALAXY 



that takes care of that. I’ve made 
my mark. 

T Te plugged the hole with ce- 
ment from the meteor re- 
pair kit on his suit belt. There 
was now a machine missing from 
the base, one that had been 
there in his own time, but he 
couldn’t do anything about that. 
He did manage to close the air- 
lock doors as he left. 

The breathtaking beauty of 
the full Earth stopped him out- 
side the ship. He gazed at the 
magnificent bluish-white disk, 
trying to decide what made it 
seem different. Was there more 
cloud area? Whatever the reason, 
the sight was more impressive 
than ever. 

Then it came to him. The 
Earth was bigger! It was prob- 
ably twice as large as he had 
ever seen it. Of course, there 
was nothing nearby to compare 
it to; which was why he hadn’t 
noticed before. 

Mike was smiling as he enter- 
ed the lock. The Moon has been 
moving outward from the Earth 
since creation, picking up energy 
from the slowing of the Earth’s 
rotation. He must be a long way 
into the past. About three billion 
years . 

He pushed through the inner 
door and stood a moment, look- 
ing down the three broken rows 
— one along the floor of the ship, 

WRONG-WAY STREET 



the others down the sides — of 
amethyst portholes. It would 
have been nice to be able to se« 
out, but the glassy material wai 
transparent only to a wide range 
of ultraviolet light 

He went through the motions 
at the control panel. Right pyra- 
mid knob in — and it had better 
be the right move. Generator on. 
Glass block betwe«i the poles. 
Generator off. 

He floated. 

Suddenly, remembering the 
sight of the central pyramid 
‘turning’, Mike was glad that he 
could not see the ship traveling 
through time. Obviously the 
aliens could stand the sight — 
but they could also look at the 
central pyramid, for they had 
done nothing to protect them- 
selves from it. 

A green line crept across the 
board, covering and wiping out 
the faint purple line. Mike let 
it grow until the purple line wai 
gone, then slipped on his gener- 
ator. 

Wrong, wrong! He was still ht 
free fall! 

I n hideous indecision he watch- 
ed the board, waiting for it 
to tell him — it didn’t matter 
what, for the board was quiet 
and dark. In the end he left the 
knob in and the generator oa 
and pushed himself aft. He had 
to get a look outside. 



31 



He braced himself in the air- 
lock, suspiciously examining the 
brilliant sky for any sign that 
he was still traveling in time. 
There was nothing. Mike turned 
on his shoes and gingerly stepped 
out onto the hull. When he look- 
ed down, the Moon wasn’t there. 

A misty white planet floated 
nearby. It was a heavy atmo- 
sphere type, as uniform and fea- 
tureless as a piece of bedsheet. 
It was Venus, if he was still in 
the solar system. Otherwise — 
heavy atmospheres are the norm 
in space. 

It seemed obvious now that 
he’d guessed wrong. The knob 
on the left must control time 
travel; the one on the right, 
space travel. It was a chance he 
he’d have to take. 

Mike watched the white disk 
slowly setting toward one hori- 
zon of the ship. As the last thing 
he might see in life, it left a lot 
to be desired. Still, blank as it 
was, he could tell quite a bit 
about it. It couldn’t be very 
large, for instance. If it were a 
giant, its atmosphere would be 
banded. It must be bigger than 
Mars to have an opaque atmo- 
sphere, but, unless an oversized 
moon had stripped away most of 
the air, it couldn’t be much larg- 
er than Earth. 

When he saw its star he could 
try guessing its surface temper- 
ature. 



He sat down on the hull. There 
were two days’ worth of oxygen 
in the ship, and little chance that 
it would get him home. He was 
lost in both space and time. He 
didn’t know how to go into the 
future; if there was a way, he 
could expect to spend months 
looking for it. It was time to face 
death. 

Besides, he’d been running for 
hours, torn by conflicting emo- 
tions, through a world whose laws 
were more black magic than phy- 
sics. It was high time for a cof- 
fee break. 

Mike licked dry lips. That last, 
lost cup of coffee would have 
tasted wonderful. A cigarette 
would have tom his throat out 
after four and a half years, but 
it would have felt natural and 
smelled good smoldering between 
his fingers. 

He’d left precious little legacy 
for the others at the base; a 
spare spacesuit that couldn’t fit 
anyone else, three sets of loung- 
ing overalls, and a few interesting 
discoveries. He’d taken the space- 
ship; they’d cuss him out good 
for that . 

Or had he ever lived at all? He 
had died before he was bom. 
Perhaps there would be no Mike 
Capoferri, ever. 

But UN Flight Four would 
find his anonymous traces when 
they opened the base. Footprints 
in moondust. A sculpting tool 



32 



GALAXY 



missing from the rec room. A 
hole in the floor; his cement was 
sure to disintegrate in three bil- 
lion years. Would they ever 
guess how deep it was? The 
damn thing must have fallen all 
the way to the center of the 
Moon. 

Searing light stabbed his eyes- 
Mike groped blindly for his fil- 
ter switch, and found it The 
light became bearable. 

A sun was rising over the hull. 

It looked very much like the 
Sun as seen from the Moon; but 
that only meant that it wasn’t. 
Seen from a Venus orbit, the Sun 
would have been much larger. 
He was in another solar system. 

Could the ship have come 
home by itself? Was that the 
home world of the base race? 
No, of course not. The aliens 
had had a water metabolism, and 
there would be no water down 
there. That world, in an Earth- 
like orbit around a type G yellow 
dwarf, must have a surface tem- 
perature of around five hundred 
degrees Fahrenheit. 

Mr. Parkman in Physics IB 
had told him that “The Earth’s 
atmosphere goes ‘way past the 
Moon,” he told the class one day. 
He seemed surprised by their 
laughter. It was his highly suc- 
cessful way of holding their at- 
tention. “No, it’s true. Of course, 
it gets pretty thin. The idea is 



that the Earth’s atmosphere end* 
where its density drops to the 
density of surrounding space, la 
the same way, the Sun’s atmo- 
sphere goes out beyond Mars. 

“Well, the air is thin enough 
to behave like separate particles 
at that distance. So the Moon m 
constantly whipping through thi* 
cloud of gas molecules — he 
made frantic motions with hi* 
hands — “and it pulls some of 
them up to escape velocity every, 
time it goes by. Naturally they’re 
never heard from again. The air 
keeps replacing itself, more or 
less, by volcanic action. 

“Now, most planets don’t have 
giant moons, so they grow tre- 
mendous air envelopes. Like Ve- 
nus. Here’s where the greenhouse 
effect comes in . .” 

Mike snapped back to the pres- 
ent because of something small 
and dark and spinning. With the 
light filter over his eyes he 
couldn’t see more. He looked 
away. Something was worrying 
at the bottom of his mind. 

Again his mind’s eye watched 
the sculpting tool fall into a tun- 
nel of its own making. He saw it 
lying at the center of the Moon, 
perhaps carving out a little pit 
for itself . 

Wrong. There would be mil- 
lions of tons of pressure to flat- 
ten any cavity into oblivion . ^ 
Any cavity but one. Now the 
picture was right. 



WRONG-WAY STREET 



33 



The sun had dropped below 
the hull, though part of the co- 
rona still showed. Mike raised 
his filter and searched for the 
spinning blob. He knew what it 
was, now. 

At first glance it looked like 
a walnut shell; but not quite, for 
the shape was wrong and the 
convolutions were too deep. 
What it really resembled was a 
deflated beach ball which some- 
body has crushed between his 
hands. 

The moon had had a long time 
to push itself through a sphere 
an inch and a half in diameter. 
Probably it had not taken more 
than a few millenia. Afterwards 
there had been nothing but this 
crumpled ball of waste, too light 
and rigid for gravity to com- 
press it further. For three billion 
years the Earth had been moon- 
less. 

“. Six to eight hundred de- 
grees!” Mr. Parkman waited a 
moment while the scribblers 
caught up. “They knew about 
the greenhouse effect, but they 
hadn’t dreamed that it would 
apply to little Venus. You could 
melt lead in such a greenhouse! 

“The point is, the astronomers 
were using Earth as a norm. It 
isn’t. The Earth-Moon system is 
an astronomical freak. A normal 
planet in Earth’s orbit would 
have an opaque, very thick at- 
mosphere, so thick that wind and 



light and temperature changes 
would never reach the surface. 
An eternal searing black calm.” 

A yrike turned and crawled into 
the airlock, moving as fast 
as he dared in free fall. He could 
have gone mad waiting for the 
inner door to open, but he didn’t 
dare. The knowledge of certain 
death had been better than this 
aching sense of responsibility. 

The door opened and he jump- 
ed toward the control board. Al- 
ready he was planning. He had 
to go back some time before his 
first arrival. Then — remove the 
sculpting tools from the rec room, 
or somehow scramble the con- 
trols of the base airlock, or leave 
a message for liimself’ on the 
outer door. Anything to restore 
the past. 

The glass block had not float- 
ed out of place. All he had to do 
was cut the magnetic field. He 
watched the purple line until he 
was sure that it was longer than 
it had been before. When he 
flipped the generator back on 
his feet thumped satisfyingly 
against the floor. Half the battle. 

Ghosts from his childhood 
whispered to him while he wait- 
ed for the outer door to open. 
Parkman was there, but Mike 
refused to listen to him. He re- 
membered Tony; which was un- 
fair, because he’d only robbed 
Tony of eight years. 



34 



GALAXY 



The door opened on the Moon. 
Mike bounded toward the base. 

... Or had he? He really 
should have known better than 
to loan Tony his Flexy. His 
Flexy, because Tony’s had a 
broken wheel. Had he told Doc- 
tor Stuart that? No. 

“Time is a one-way street,” 
said Doctor Stuart, sympatheti- 
cally but firmly. He was wrong, 
dead wrong. 

Mike stood before the base 
airlock wriggling his fingers like 
a clarinet player. How far back 
had he come this time? He turn- 
ed left to see the size of the 
Earth. 

It wasn’t there. 

But it was always there! Be- 
wildered, Mike peered around 



him. The Moon must still be 
rotating . 

To his right, the Earth was a 
vast, incredible crescent — and 
the plain was full of ships. They 
were of many different sizes, but 
they all had the same lump cy- 
lindrical shape. Tiny figures 
moved among them. 

Stuart was right, he thought 
idiotically. You go the wrong 
way on a one-way street, you’ve 
got to have accidents. He turned 
and ran. 

Behind him the lock swung 
open. Two ten-foot tripeds turn- 
ed to each other and gestured 
rapidly, like nests of striking 
snakes. Then one of them hop- 
ped after him and picked him up.

DEATH and BIRTH 
of the ANGAKOK 

by HAYDEN HOWARD 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



This was the start of the Eskimo 
Invasion — a creature from beyond 
the stars, and a Stone Age humanl 



I 

TJehind his back his sled dogs 
' whined as if sea demons 
were hunting under the ice. 
Something clanked down there. 
Through the soles of his muk- 
luks, Peterluk felt the sharp 
echoes. His youthful eyes nar- 
rowed. 



A strange grinding — a metal- 
lic sound was rising from the 
Arctic Ocean beneath the ice. 

“Turn-nrak — spirit, go away!” 
Peterluk threatened shrilly in his 
jumbled English and Eskimo 
speech. “Go away. This person’s 
Grandfather is an angakok!” 
The glittering pack-ice bulged. 
Sometliing big, very big — only 

36 



a demon-whale would try to 
break through ice this thick 1 
Peterluk glanced toward the 
hopelessly distant gray shore. 
There, within the dark speck of 
a tent his Grandfather was 
crouched listening to the world. 
Under Peterluk’s feet the ice 
shuddered. 

“Grandfather, help me.” Pe- 
terluk’s voice faded into distance. 

The ice cracked. Whimpering, 
tile sled dogs backed away, fur- 
ther entangling their traces. The 
dogs yipped as a thunder boom 
struck Peterluk’s eardrums. A 
cloud-trail shrieked across the 
Arctic sky. 

“Kabloonas — whitemen, help 
me!” Peterluk shouted after the 
vanishing jet bomber. 

But the whitemen had become 
as distant as the stars since that 
moment of terror when the Es- 
kimos ran away. The Eskimos 
had not even returned to collect 
their Family Allowances from 
the Canadian government. The 
whitemen would not help him. 

A jarring thud beneath the 
ice hurled Peterluk to his knees. 

“Grandfather, help me! Grand- 
father — ” Then Peterluk’s broad 
face contorted in realization. 
“Forgive me. Grandfather — if 
my thoughts of you were bad.” 

He tried to run. A bubbling 
uproar of water erupted from a 
crack like an open mouth — to 
devour him. 



“Have mercy. Grandfather.” 
Peterluk stood motionless. “This 
poor miserable person was not 
trying to run away from your 
island.” The dogs howled. 

“Grandfather!” Peterluk wail- 
ed, leaping, shouting, his shrill 
voice starting a flight of gulls 
toward the island, toward his 
Grandfather’s distant tent. The 
tent was much bigger than an 
ordinary Eskimo tent because of 
what it concealed from the air- 
plane-eyes. At this distance, the 
tent was smaller than the front 
sight of Peterluk’s rifle. Across 
the shimmering ice, Peterluk 
knew his voice flew to the an- 
gakok, crouching in the darkness 
of the tent upon the navel of 
the world. 

“Grandfather, this person was 
thinking only good thoughts 
about you. This person would 
never leave you while my wife 
is in your talons.” 

Peterluk spread his arms. “You 
are holding my baby son. Glad- 
ly, this poor person will hunt 
seals for you always. This per- 
son will never complain again. 
This person will drag your sky 
iron anywhere. Like a sled dog 
this person will drag your heavy 
sky iron wherever you point your 
face. Eh-eh, yes — yes, joyfully 
this person will drag your sky 
iron. My wife and baby son when 
he is bigger will drag your sky 
iron — ” 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK

■peterluk gasped for breath, un- 
^ used to sudi oratory. Behind 
his back the ice growled. 

“Please, Grandfather, great 
mngakok, great worker of magic, 
please send away your demon.” 
Peterluk clutched his rifle. 

“Who will bring fat seals for 
you? If this poor hunter is de- 
voured by the demon, you will 
starve. Do not let the demon 
come out of the sea. Eh-eh, this 
person promises to kiU you — 
kill a fat seal for you. Grand- 
father, far-dreaming angakok, in- 
to your jaws a fat seal!” 

The ice creaked. The dogs’ 
voices whined. The demon had 
not devoured them. 

With his finger on the trigger 
of his rifle, Peterluk turned, 
peering at the new lead of open 
water. The low sun shot arrows 
into his stinging eyes. He could 
not see the demon in the water. 

Peterluk scowled at himself. 
Perhaps the bad noises had been 
only a current under the ice 
dragging something, a log, a dead 
walrus, a dead seal, a fat seal. 
The corners of Peterluk’s eyes 
wrinkled like smiles. 

“Ha-ho! You rabbits!” Peter- 
luk shouted at his sled dogs. 
“What were you afraid of? A 
current? Ha! Get up! We go!” 
But Peterluk’s painfully learn- 
ed caution returned, and he bow- 
ed toward the distant shoreline. 
“Thank you. Grandfather, for 



your mercy this person will bring 
you a fat seal.” 

A bad thought crept out of his 
skull : May it choke you to death. 

“Dog! Why are you lying 
down?” Peterluk yanked the 
nearest dog by the harness so 
hard it yelped. 

“Grandfather, this person is 
hurrying.” With kicks and 
shoves, Peterluk unsorted the 
tangled dogs. “Eh-eh, we will 
travel far out to open water 
where the seals are. Oh, merci- 
ful angakok, we will leave this 
demon hole.” 

Under Peterluk’s hand the lead 
dog was shivering with excite- 
ment as if a seal had risen 
nearby. Impossible. Peterluk was 
afraid to look. No seal would 
rise in this bad place. 

In unison the dogs turned their 
heads toward the demon hole. 
Peterluk leaned forward, blink- 
ing. A dark spot? In the shim- 
mering lead of open water a dark 
spot was swimming. A seal in 
the demon hole? Peterluk’s mas- 
sive Eskimo jaw sagged. 

He became motionless, almost. 
Convulsively, he swallowed the 
saliva flooding his hungry mouth. 
If he shot the seal in the water 
it would sink, but in a moment 
the seal would notice the dogs 
and would dive forever. Peter- 
luk’s head began to hurt. What 
should he do? 

Overhead the shriek of an-

DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK

other jet split the sky. Peterluk’s 
big teeth flashed white, a grin 
of disgust and relief. He did not 
have to decide what to do. The 
•eal would dive. 

“Good-by, brother seal.” 

^^hen Peterluk giggled. Aston- 
ishingly, not even the noise 
from the jet bomber had made 
the seal dive. The seal was still 
swimming toward him, swimming 
awkwardly as if injured, splash- 
ing through the water, swimming 
so strangely. Seal or demon? 

“Na-una — this person does 
not know,” Peterluk whispered, 
squinting with bewilderment at 
ttiis world he could not under- 
stand. 

“Grandfather, great angakok, 
tell me what to do. The seal- 
demon is swimming closer.” 

During Peterluk’s short life 
the pieces had not fit. As a nose- 
picking boy he had witnessed 
mumbling Canadian doctors 
holding up magic skeleton pic- 
tures. He had watched open- 
mouthed while his father beat 
a hoop-drum and another older 
Eskimo, perhaps his Grandfath- 
er, had danced and danced and 
fallen down, was bound with 
thongs, yet vanished from the 
darkened igloo, and reappeared! 
The old Eskimo said he had 
been away hunting caribou on 
the moon and held up a caribou 
haunch to prove it 



This was more than four 
winters ago when Peterluk was 
an unworried boy who did not 
have to decide anything. 

Another important time, four 
winters ago, when the Eskimos 
came into the Post to collect 
their Family Allowances the 
southern horizon had sparkled. 

“End of the world!” the Es- 
kimo minister had shouted, but 
he had been wrong. 

Peterluk’s father had laughed 
and cursed like a whiteman, and 
stolen a can of kerosene. The 
Elskimos had left the slant-eyed 
minister and fled north, leaving 
the whitemen. “Forever,” Peter- 
luk’s father had insisted. “End 
of their ways.” 

But whitemen’s spirits were 
everywhere, perhaps as strong as 
demons! Was this a demon or a 
seal? 

“Matthew, Mark, Luke and 
John,” Peterluk whispered to- 
ward the demon hole, “command 
this one little wounded seal to 
climb up on the ice.” 

The seal raised its indistinct 
head above the water. It was 
trying to see up on to the ice. 
But it sank back. 

“Grandfather,” Peterluk hiss- 
ed, “tell your seal to climb up 
on the ice.” 

A gain it heaved up. Oddly, one 
of its flippers raised like a 
hand. Peterluk giggled nervously 



40 



GALAXY 



As he watched, the seal bent its 
head beneath the surface. Peter- 
luk’s hand tightened on his rifle. 
Only the seal’s gleaming back 
was visible. Peterluk knew it was 
preparing to dive. The seal would 
vanish forever. Peterluk raised 
his rifle. 

“lyonamut!” Peterluk exhaled. 

He shot. 

His ears ringing, snatching up 
his harpoon, Peterluk raced to- 
ward the thrashing black shape. 
He cried out, stumbling, as it 
sank. He fell to his knees at the 
edge of the ice where it had been. 

Peering down into the shad- 
owy water, Peterluk witnessed its 
dark silhouette drifting down- 
ward and away. Violently, he 
plunged his harpoon. His hand 
stung. The shaft of the harpoon 
slashed the water back and forth, 
tom loose from his hand by the 
agonized strength of the aninial 
under the water. 

With a shout of triumph, Pet- 
erluk hauled at the harpoon line, 
and the harpoon’s iron and ivory 
barbed head twisted within the 
flesh, anchoring itself. The freed 
wooden shaft floated back up 
the taut line to the surface. Pet- 
erluk grabbed it, and he jammed 
the wooden shaft into a crack 
in the ice for support. He braced 
himself in case the seal made a 
sudden rush, for this was no or- 
dinary seal and he did not know 
what to expect. 



The tugging line signalled iti 
struggles, weaker and weaker. 
His breath wheezing in and out, 
Peterluk waited for the seal to 
drown down there. 

When he could feel no motion 
except a slight dragging from the 
current, Peterluk began drawing 
in the line hand over hand, his 
movements becoming tight-mus- 
cled and hesitant as the long 
blur neared the surface. Tangled 
in tiie line, it was rising upside 
down. 

Its hind flippers seemed split 
apart much farther than a seal’s. 
On its back appeared a hump, 
a long hump strapped on like a 
dog’s pack, a seal with a pack 
on its back? 

Peterluk’s mouth opened. But 
his stubby hunter’s hands con- 
tinued hauling up the line. 

Rising, turning in the current, 
the dark shape struck the under- 
edge of the ice with a startling 
metallic sound like a ship’s bell. 
Its front flippers swayed out 
thin and black and much longer 
than a seal’s. Then its slack head 
was tilted upward in the water. 

Peterluk’s soul leaped out of 
his mouth in a scream of horror. 

Its face, its face was all one 
huge round gleaming eye. 

Falling away, snatching up his 
rifle in his flight to the sled, 
Peterluk whipped his dogs across 
the ice toward the distant shore. 
There was no hissing or roaring 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK 



41 



of demons behind him. Glancing 
back, he glimpsed nothing but 
glaring white pack-ice. 

“Aii-ee! Its tribe, they are 
pursuing me under the ice!” 
Cracking his whip, he belabored 
the sled dogs toward the drift- 
wood beach. 

II 

T T e shouted at his wife to get 
the baby out of the tent. 
“We must go from here! Get my 
son!” 

“The angakok, it holds the 
baby.” She lowered her head in 
a gesture of helplessness. “What 
are you thinking of? Una? What 
is it?” She giggled nervously. 
“What are you afraid of now?” 

“Demons! Look — you — you 
stupid woman. A tribe of demons 
coming. This unlucky person has 
shot a seal demon. Now its whole 
tribe is coming for our blood 
and eyes.” 

Stupidly, Peterluk’s wife stood 
staring out over the pack-ice. 
“There is nothing but ice.” 

Her dead father had travelled 
much with missionaries and had 
left her with a stupid lack of 
understanding when it came to 
demons. 

“Demons! There, and there, 
and ever5Twhere. Seal demons. 
You, you can’t expect to see 
them!” Peterluk shouted. “You 
tvoman!” 



Peterluk plunged into the 
darkness of the tent. “Grand- 
father, great angakok, help me. 
Demons are coming! Seal de- 
mons. Through no fault of his 
own this person accidentally shot 
a seal demon — what is that 
noise? Grandfather, its tribe 
comes for blood vengeance.” 

The angakok’s hump-backed 
shape swayed upward. Within 
the big tent, the angakok tower- 
ed above Peterluk. Muttering 
like an uneasy bear, it held 
Peterluk’s baby son cradled in 
its talons. It leaned weakly 
against the huge dented ball of 
sky iron. 

In the dimness of the tent, 
clothed in its gigantic parka of 
caribou skins sewn by Peterluk’s 
wife, the angakok resembled a 
man — if the beholder needed to 
see a man. Like a man, its 
burned face had two white eyes. 
Its drooling mouth was ever 
hungry for seal meat. Its taloned 
hands were as quick as the hands 
of a man. From its hands fire 
had engulfed Peterluk’s father. 
Only a powerful Eskimo anga- 
kok could work such magic. Af- 
ter the first winter, it had re- 
membered and agreed with Pet- 
erluk. Because it had flown far 
from the Earth, because it was 
the most powerful angakok, it 
must be Peterluk’s vanished 
Grandfather returned from the 
sky, and Peterluk had believed! 



42 



GALAXY 



“Grandfather, use your pow- 
er!” Peterluk scuttled sideways 
within the big tent, a tent too 
big, too cold because its purpose 
was to hide tlie sky iron, which 
was neither meteorite nor satel- 
Kte. 

The round mass of the sky 
iron, higher than a winter igloo, 
occupied the whole center of the 
tent. To Peterluk’s dismay, he 
noticed that the perpetual buzz- 
ing and clicking from the broken 
wire intestines within the sky 
iron sounded weaker. Even the 
magic blue light which glowed 
through the burned hole in the 
side of the sky iron seemed dim- 
mer. Peterluk suspected that the 
angakok could not renew its 
magic power from the sky iron, 
the broken sky sled in which it 
had fallen like a flaming egg 
from the stars. Now, when much 
power was needed to protect 
Peterluk from the seal demons, 
the angakok leaned weakly 
against the sky iron and did 
nothing. 

The baby whimpered. 

“Hear the demons approach- 
ing!” Peterluk cried out. “Even 
my baby son hears the demons. 
Grandfather, this person did not 
mean to shoot the seal demon. 
Protect me, or let us flee from 
this evil island.” 

Dropping to his knees, Peter- 
luk seized one of the long drift- 
wood sled-runners upon which 



the sky iron was permanently 
lashed. The angakok growled in 
warning. 

Peterluk sprang back. His head 
began to hurt as the angakok’a 
eyes glowed, expanding dream 
pictures inside Peterluk’s head. 

The blurry picture of a big 
thing shaped like a whale with 
a hump on its back was moving 
beneath the ice. In its belly 
something burned like a distant 
bonfire. This was not a clear 
picture, and Peterluk had the 
frightened feeling that the an- 
gakok did not understand what 
it was seeing. 

'"T^he angakok forced another 
picture into Peterluk’s head, 
the whale-thing, now floating on 
the surface like a ship. The an- 
gakok seemed to be asking him 
a question. Little naked Eiski- 
mos appeared on top of the 
whale-ship. This was impossible. 
Any ship was impossible. 

“No ship out there,” Peterluk 
shouted slowly, trying to make 
the angakok understand. “De- 
mons, protect us against demons. 
Seal demons.” 

Peterluk tried to brush away 
the ship pictures with his hand. 

“Too much ice for a ship,” he 
insisted. “My own eyes have 
seen no smoke, no masts on the 
horizon, no trading ship, no ship. 
Grandfather, listen, it is demons 
we must fear.” 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK 



43 



Outside the tent, the dogs be- 
gan to howl. 

“The demons are close,” Pet- 
erluk gasped. “Grandfather, 
great angakok, now, quickly, 
burn them with all of your magic 
power.” 

Three times Peterluk had 
seen the angakok turn iron into 
fire. The first time four years 
ago other Eskimos fell down, 
burning and d3ring, Peterluk’s 
father among them. The second 
time had been to punish Peter- 
luk when he tried to escape 
from the island. The third time 
had been when the parachutist 
landed, so charred that Peterluk 
had been unable to recognize 
whether it was an Eskimo or a 
Whiteman. 

But now the angakok stood 
swaying and holding the baby 
and doing nothing. A dog whim- 
pered outside the tent. 

“Grandfather, the seal dem- 
ons have arrived! Quickly, work 
great magic.” Peterluk knelt, his 
heart thudding. 

During the four years since 
his Grandfather fell from the sky 
Peterluk had told his Grand- 
father many tales of the magic 
of other Eskimo angakoks. Al- 
though his Grandfather could 
speak no more clearly than a 
polar bear, he listened to Peter- 
luk’s words — even when Peter- 
luk was not speaking. The anga- 
kok had crowded questioning 



pictures into Peterluk’s head as 
if his Grandfather had forgotten 
the ways of the Eskimos. Soon 
the angakok had become less in- 
terested in demons, more inter- 
ested in the world to the south. 
How many people? Peterluk 
tried to ^ow there were more 
whitemen than the fingers and 
toes of all the people who could 
be crowded into this big tent 
Their weapons? Rifles like his. 
The noisy flying objects? Air- 
planes containing doctors, minis- 
ters and Canadian Mounted Po- 
licemen. What carried the air- 
planes through the air? The ma- 
gic power of the Canadian Gov- 
ernment, Peterluk had explain- 
ed, but powerful angakoks could 
fly without using airplanes. Now 
the angakok must use his power. 

“Grandfather, you must use 
fire magic against the seal de- 
mons!” Peterluk gasped. “Bum 
them like you burned the Eski- 
mos!” 

A triangle of light stabbed 
into the tent. As the tent flap 
opened, Peterluk shrieked. He 
thought the seal demons had 
come for him. 

The silhouette was his wife. 

“A ship!” she laughed excited- 
ly. “After four years, a ship.” 

“There is no ship!” Peterluk 
shouted. “Come in here quickly. 
A ship is impossible. It is a trick 
of the seal demons to make me 
go out on the ice.” 



44 



GALAXY 



But his wife, with her usual 
foolhardy attitude toward de- 
mons, scurried outside, shouting 
for Peterluk to come out. 

“A trading ship!” she shouted. 
*‘A wonderful trading ship.” 

peterluk whimpered. As far 
out as a whole day’s sledding 
from shore the ice was too thick 
for a trading ship. Even a power- 
ful ice-1 )reaker would have been 
visible on the horizon for many 
days before it finally arrived, 
slowly butting its way through 
the ice. 

Behind Peterluk in the dark 
tent the angakok was clutching 
the baby to its chest. On the 
angakok' s back its growing hump 
heaved and writhed as if it had 
life of its own, and the angakok 
lumbered past Peterluk to the 
tent flap. Squatting down, the 
angakok looked out into the 
bright world. It emitted a cough- 
ing cry. 

When Peterluk peered out past 
the angakok’s massive caribou- 
skin leggings into the glare of 
the ice. his eyes narrowed. 

“It is impossible,” Peterluk 
murmured apologetically. 

But this low ship was so dis- 
tinct he could see even the men 
on top of the tall gray cabin as 
if they were really there. 

“Wave to them, build a sig- 
nal fire!” his wife shouted. “Now 
is our chance.” 



Peterluk did not know wheth- 
er she meant their chance to 
escape from the angakok or their 
chance to trade with the white - 
men. 

“See the Kabloonas climbing 
down on to the ice,” she shouted. 
“See, they are handing down 
wonderful shiny things, fine guns, 
wonderful black boxes. All those 
black boxes, they must be load- 
ed with trade goods, mirrors, 
cotton cloth. Family Allowances, 
CARE packages, and we need 
many cans of kerosene.” 

His wife bustled past him into 
the tent and began to gather 
up the white fox furs. 

“Hurry up,” Peterluk’s wife 
shouted. “This person knows 
they are signalling for us to 
leave the angakok here and go 
out to their ship. We will trade 
fox furs for all sorts of wonder- 
ful things. Tell the angakok we 
will soon return. The angakok 
must let us leave.” 

On the low ship, a light was 
winking. The ship was gray as 
a whale. 

“The ship,” Peterluk murmur- 
ed wonderingly, “it is like a 
great kayak.” 

Neither Peterluk nor his wife 
had ever seen a submarine. 

“This person will take my 
baby now.” Peterluk’s wife sign- 
ed for the angakok to hand her 
the baby. 

The angakok did not do so. 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK 



45 



\ Iways before when whitemen 
approached in airplanes, tire 
angakok had hidden. 

His Grandfather had growled 
and seemed afraid of the white- 
men’s planes. But now the anga- 
kok wanted Peterluk to drive 
the sled out over the ice to- 
ward the whitemen’s ship. 

“Demons’ ship!’’ Peterluk 
bleated in realization. “No 
whitemen! Seal demons. Grand- 
father, you are giving me to the 
demons!” 

He tried to run, but the magic 
thoughts of the angakok were 
too strong. 

“Trade for flour.” Peterluk’s 
wife shouted after them. “And 
needles!” 

Al^hile Peterluk drove the 
^ ’ sled out over the ice to- 
ward the ship, he muttered with 
fear. From the corners of his 
eyes he studied each crack in the 
ice, half expecting a vengeful 
demon to spring up. The sled 
lurched. Concealed under the 
fox furs, the angakok growled 
in warning. Hisses of icy wind 
slithered across the pack-ice. 

“Grandfather, protect me!” 
Peterluk stared at the mirage of 
the ship. 

The low ship appeared almost 
real. The small shapes like men 
moved on the roof of its cabin. 
They climbed down awkardly 
like real whitemen. 



But the mast was not believ- 
able. It resembled a thin stove 
pipe with a Imob at the upper 
end. And a strange round net 
was turning on the roof of the 
cabin, sweeping the sky. 

Peterluk’s brow wrinkled. If 
these were whitemen — trying to 
net low-flying puffins at this 
hopeless distance from the bird 
nesting cliffs, they must be starv- 
ing. 

The small man-shapes were 
setting up something on the ice. 
It had three thin legs. Now they 
were attaching something strange 
on top. It was longer than a shot- 
gun barrel, thicker than — 

Agitated picture-thoughts from 
the angakok crowded into Peter- 
luk’s head. Stop the sled. 

“Hoo!” Peterluk halted the 
sled dogs. “Grandfather, those 
men are all dressed in gray, like 
seals. Seal demons, too many for 
you to bum. Let us go back.” 

To Peterluk’s horror, the anga- 
kok pictured to him to pick up 
a white fox fur and walk toward 
the seal demons. 

“No, Grandfather.” But Peter- 
luk’s leg stumbled forward over 
the sea ice. 

He was walking beside a lead 
of open water toward the ship. 
With a startled whimper, he 
clutched the fox fur to his chest. 
From the corner of his eye he 
glimpsed his own harpoon shaft 
still wedged in a crack beside the 



46 



GALAXY 




lead. Here he had harpooned the 
seal demon. His eyes widened. 
Here came the seal demons from 
the ship, their legs running to- 
ward him. 

“Grandfather, protect me!” 
Peterluk closed his eyes. 

His grandfather had shown 
great power four years ago when 
the Eskimos hammered on his 
sky iron. The Eskimos had 
found the sky iron in a heat- 
glazed hole. A star had fallen 
from the Arctic night. Some said 
it was a meteorite for which the 
whitemen would give a reward. 
Others had said it was a satel- 
lite for which the whitemen 
would give a bigger reward. 
Laughing, they had hammered 
the big dented ball with their 
rifle butts, and the angakok had 
emerged, growling. 

Women shrieked. Someone 
had shot. The angakok roared 
like a speared bear and the Es- 
kimos’ knives and rifle barrels 
had glowed red, exploding. 
Flames like fur covered the near- 
est Eskimos. Children became 
darting streaks of flame. Only 
Peterluk and a girl who was far- 
thest away survived. When Pet- 
erluk had tried to flee, the an- 
gakok had burned him — a little. 
When Peterluk had knelt be- 
fore the angakok, he had under- 
stood it must be his vanished 
Grandfather. Only his Grandfa- 
ther could have such power. 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK 



47 



I^r ow Peterluk knew his Grand- 

^ father’s power had leaked 
out. Peterluk could hear the 
seal men — running — closer 
and closer. 

“Matthew, Mark, Luke and 
John,” Peterluk murmured in 
desperation. 

For a long time he had sus- 
pected his Grandfather’s power 
was diminishing. During the four 
years since the burning of the 
other Eskimos, Peterluk had 
grown to the strength of a man. 
Often he grumbled when the 
angakok indicated it was time 
to break camp, to move the 
heavy sky iron. When he was 
slow to obey the angakok had 
burned him. Later, as the anga- 
kok’s hump had grown bigger it 
simply waited. Muttering to 
himself, Peterluk finally would 
lever the sky iron on to the 
sled. He would obey, although 
he could not understand why 
the angakok desired to move to 
a new camp while there v/as 
still good hunting here. Was the 
angakok searching for new 
power? 

Peterluk could not know that 
they were following the North 
Magnetic Pole. The focus of the 
Earth’s magnetic lines of force 
is a shifting thing. In the dis- 
tant past of 1903, Amundsen lo- 
cated the North Magnetic Pole 
at Latitude 71“ North, Longi- 
tude 96“ West on the Boothia 



Peninsula. By 1945 it had shift- 
ed with many hesitations and 
waverings in a true northerly 
direction several hundred miles 
to Latitude 76° North, Longi- 
tude 102“ West. By Peterluk’s 
time the North Magnetic Pole 
had shifted across the Boothia 
Peninsula and its ice-locked is- 
lands. Induced by the mysterious 
flowages within the core of the 
planet, it wavered across the 
coastal islands, closer and clos- 
er to the last shore-camp be- 
side the deepening Arctic Ocean, 

Here, Peterluk had gone out 
on the ice to hunt fat seals for 
his Grandfather. 

Peterluk knew his Grandfa- 
ther’s power was diminishing be- 
cause his dreams had changed. In 
the night Peterluk would awak- 
en moaning with loneliness, not 
his own. It was loneliness from 
the overlapping dreams of the 
angakok. In first dreams there 
had been two suns circling. Twin 
shadows spread out from mov- 
ing things. Peterluk had cried 
out in his sleep until he had 
grown used to these shape- 
changing things for which he had 
no words. Even the patterns of 
the stars were strange. But more 
and more the angakok^s dreams 
included familiar snow and ice, 
and Peterluk recognized himself, 
his wife, the sled dogs, and air- 
planes droning high overhead. In 
its dreams the angakok moaned 



48 



GALAXY 



at the airplane. Peterluk knew 
the angakok’s power must be 
weak if it feared the airplanes 
of the whitemen. 

■peterluk’s nostrils flared — the 
scent of tobacco. He opened 
his eyes and shouted joy at the 
approaching men. They were not 
seal men. They were whitemen. 
They smelled like whitemen. 
Peterluk rushed to meet them, 
his hand outstretched in a white- 
man’s ceremonial greeting. 

As he shook hands with each 
of the gray-uniformed whitemen, 
Peterluk’s smile spread wider 
and wider, for he could not un- 
derstand a word they said. Their 
Canadian was the strangest he 
had ever heard. Not a word was 
familiar to him, and he nodded 
politely as if he understood. 

The whitemen were pointing 
this way and that. Peterluk 
glanced toward the sled where 
the angakok lay concealed be- 
neath the furs. In a moment he 
planned to lead the whitemen to 
the sled. He would snatch off the 
white fox furs and laugh at the 
helpless squirming of the anga- 
kok because magic will not work 
against whitemen. 

Peterluk’s eyes narrowed. In 
those black boxes beside the 
ship there must be all sorts of 
wonderful things. 

Peterluk imagined knives and 
fishhooks, gramaphone records 



and cartons of gleaming rifle bul- 
lets. Everything a man could 
possibly want soon would be hia 
for the trading. No doubt there 
was an alarm clock in one of 
those black boxes for his baby 
son to play with, and silk 
scarves, face cream, lip grease. 
His wife was a fine woman and 
deserved all of these things. 

Peterluk held up the fine white 
fox fur. After four years of trap- 
ping without trading he had more 
fox furs than any Eskimo! He 
giggled with embarrassment. 

“Only a few poor foxes has 
this person,” Peterluk spoke 
with an Eskimo traditional self- 
depreciation before strangers. 
“The foxes have outsmarted me 
again — ” 

Never had Peterluk seen fin- 
er furs than his own! 

But the most important white- 
man barely glanced at the fox 
fur. Evidently he was a shrewd 
trader. He shaded his eyes as if 
he was looking around for some- 
thing else. He made thrashing 
motions with his arms. 

Peterluk’s eyes widened with 
understanding. “Seals. Eh-eh, 
yes-yes, seals.” 

Evidently, they had caught few 
birds in the slowly turning net 
on the roof of the cabin of their 
ship. They must be very hungry 
for seals. 

The man made more swim- 
ming motions. 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK

'T'here would be no seals where 
-*■ a ship was, but Peterluk 
smiled and nodded, unwilling to 
contradict such an important 
man. 

“Eh-eh, seals,” Peterluk agreed 
patiently, while the man made 
snorting sounds and thrust up 
his gray- capped head like a seal 
rising from the water. 

Peterluk’s admiring gaze clung 
to the shiny medals on his chest. 
The man had so many that sure- 
ly he would trade. 

Peterluk thrust out the fox 
fur. Speaking slowly in Canadian 
and very loudly so that the men 
would be sure to understand, 
Peterluk waved the white fox 
fur back and forth. “Foxes! 
Trade! Kerosene! Bullets! Bang- 
bang!” 

At this, they all began talk- 
ing so much his head hurt. Their 
caps bobbed on their heads with 
the loudness of their talking. 
Peterluk’s smile widened still 
further. More than anything he 
desired one of those fine gray 
caps. Shyly, Peterluk put his 
hand to his head. These men 
had plenty of caps, each cap 
decorated with a beautiful red 
star. 

The important man smiled 
thinly at Peterluk. “Droog. Da? 
Pa-pi-ro-sa?” 

Peterluk accepted the pack of 
cigarettes and thrust it into the 
voluminous sleeve of his parka. 



His covetous gaze clung to the 
handsome gray cap on the im- 
portant man’s head, the lovely 
red star. 

But the Whiteman was point- 
ing at the lead of open water, 
at the cracks, at Peterluk’s dis- 
tant tent. 

“Amerika-nets?” 

Did this mean seal meat? Pet- 
erluk spread his arms. “There is 
no seal meat in my tent,” he 
lied. 

This was not a hospitable 
way for an Eskimo to talk, and 
Peterluk felt ashamed. “This 
person is a very poor hunter, 
but you Kabloonas are my 
friends. Yes, yes, this person will 
hunt seals for you — after we 
have traded.” 

Peterluk’s smile returned. He 
could see a whiteman clamber- 
ing down a ladder from the roof 
of the tall cabin, carrying a sack. 
The man tossed the sack to 
other whitemen waiting on the 
ice. One of these men ran with 
the sack toward the important 
man and Peterluk. Undoubtedly, 
the sack contained what they 
wished to trade. The whitemen 
grouped around Peterluk. The 
sack was to be opened. Peterluk 
smiled expectantly. 

Peterluk’s mouth clicked 
shut. Instead of trade goods, 
from the sack was lifted a pair 
of dark cut-off fins and a huge 
round shiny eye.

P eterluk shrank from these 
cut-off parts of a seal de- 
mon, but the whitemen showed 
no fear, touching them with 
their hands, pointing along the 
leads, making searching motions 
with their faces, then stared 
hungrily at the cut-off parts and 
shifting their gaze to Peterluk’s 
blank face. 

Peterluk’s stubby hand rubbed 
his jaw. His eyes narrowed to 
slits of thought. He tottered 
like a man overcome by sleep. 

“It is understood!” Peterluk 
shouted with joy. “You white- 
men have traveled here to hunt 
seal demons. The fins, the round 
eye, like the one killed by my 
rifle and harpoon. But mine was 
bigger, much bigger!” 

Spreading his arms, Peterluk 
stood on tip-toe. 

“Big-big, very big,” Peterluk 
explained to the important man. 

Peterluk slapped his own chest. 
With a shout, he snatched up his 
rifle, thrusting its rusty muzzle 
at the round eye. “Ha! Bang!” 
Whirling, he aimed his rifle 
along the open lead. “Bang! Ha! 
Big-big!” 

The whitemen had to run to 
keep up with him. They were 
wheezing for breath as they 
neared the edge of the lead. Pet- 
erluk could see the dark straight- 
ness of his harpoon shaft. 



With his hand feeling the 
dead weight on the harpoon 
line, Peterluk nodded up at 
them. His own seal demon had 
not been freed by others of its 
tribe. Its body still hung deep 
in the water on the other end 
of the line. 

Squatting, the taut line in one 
fist, his rifle in the other, Peter- 
luk waited, smiling with pride. 
To kill a seal demon was a dif- 
ficult and dangerous thing, and 
now he frowned for dramatic ef- 
fect while studying the pale 
faces above him. These white- 
men were breathing hard, clutch - 
ing their crooked rifles as if 
afraid the seal demon still might 
be alive. 

Peterluk’s smile gleamed like 
an iceberg while he hauled in 
the line. As the dark shape of 
the seal demon neared the sur- 
face, the whitemen exclaimed 
with awe and fear, shouldering 
Peterluk aside and drawing in 
the line so rapidly that the iron 
pack on the seal demon’s back 
gonged against the underside of 
the ice. 

The whitemen lifted the de- 
man up, bent over its body. They 
shook it to be sure it was dead. 
With a cry, one tugged at the 
protruding ivory harpoon head. 
Another laid his ear to the seal 
demon’s chest, listening to be 
sure its heart had stopped. 

To Peterluk’s surprise they 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK 



51 



were able to remove the round 
glass eye by unstrapping the 
back of the head. Inside was a 
white face in imitation of a 
man’s. It looked like a drowned 
man’s — 

T7rom their angry shouts, Peter- 
■*- luk realized that the seal 
demon must be an enemy of their 
tribe. Peterluk was glad to have 
helped them. 

“Eh-eh, yes-yes, big!” Peter- 
luk slapped his chest and grin- 
ned triumphantly at their flushed 
and angry faces. 

Their faces sprang at him. 
Joltingly, he was shoved back- 
ward. His rifle was snatched 
away. Peterluk gave a great cry 
of horror as one of the white- 
men raised Peterluk’s rifle high 
and hurled it into the bottom- 
less lead so that Peterluk’s fam- 
ily would starve. 

Lurching forward, Peterluk 
glimpsed closed hands striking 
at his face. He felt a knocking 
against his head and blindly 
tried to turn away, but they 
were clinging to him like wolv- 
erines. The men behind twisted 
his arms so that he growled with 
pain, and the ones in front 
merged in a blurr of yelling 
faces and smashing hands like 
hailstones against his face. 

As Peterluk heaved to buck 
himself free, his mukluks slip- 
ped. He pitched forward, crawl- 



ing on the ice, their boots thudi 
ding against his ribs. He cried 
out in horror and humiliation. 
They were kicking him like a 
dog. 

Like a dog he was being beat- 
en by their rifle butts. 

He cried out for help. “Grand- 
father!” 

His face was mashed into the 
ice, and he heard himself chok- 
ing. 

The whitemen’s voices were 
shouting angrily among the 
thuds of boots and rifle butts 
against his ribs and skull. 
“Oobiy-tsa!” they were shouting. 
“Oobiy-tsa! America-nets oobiy- 
fas!" 

Peterluk struggled upward to 
his knees, and was beaten down. 
Like a dog he was being beat- 
en. Even his Grandfather had 
forsaken him. Peterluk merged 
his face with the ice like a dy- 
ing seal, willing himself to die, 
to leave this humiliation. 

Faintly, he heard the Kabloo- 
nas shouting to each other. 
“Lyu-di? Nye-pri-ya-tel?" they 
were shouting. “Ta-va-rishch, 
sharko li vam?” 

The boot toes in front of his 
eyes pointed toward shore. The 
men shouted unintelligibly in 
their strange language. 

“Da, comrade Captain, my ri- 
fle barrel has become hot also.” 

“The metal parts of my bino- 
culars are hot!”

“Pevski, you are the polar ex- 
pert. What do you make of it?” 
“In lieu of more complete 
evidence I must propound the 
tentative theory that there is 
some casual relationship be- 
tween the magnetic anomaly we 
were sent here to investigate and 
this sudden heating of metal 
objects. By heating I mean in 
a technical sense the sudden in- 
tensification of molecular — ” 
“Shut up, Pevski! I think it 
is an imperialist death ray!” 
“What is it Captain? Are you 
wounded? Your face shows 
pain.” 

“My hand! My medals are 
hot! Comrades, this is your cap- 
tain speaking. Fall back to the 
submarine. You, too, Pevski.” 
“My own highly tentative 
theory is that their, not to be 
underrated, research are focus- 
ing a magnetic laser, that is a 
concentration of the Earth’s mag- 
netic lines of force which would 
in some ways be analagous to 
a laser which would — ” 

“Faster, Pevski!” 

"O aising his face from the ice, 
Peterluk watched blearily 
while the whitemen ran toward 
the long ship. They were drag- 
ging the body of the seal demon, 
his seal demon. 

Peterluk struggled erect. He 
spat blood. The ruins of his face 
contorted. 




MATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK

“Like a dog,” he croaked, 
coughing, swaying. 

“Like a dog, beaten like a 
dog.” He looked around for 
his rifle, and his bloodshot eyes 
widened in horror as he remem- 
bered. “My rifle, they threw my 
rifle in the lead so my family will 
starve, and they beat me — 
“Beat me like a dog!” he 
screamed in mounting rage. 

“Grandfather, you didn’t help 
me.” Peterluk staggered toward 
the mount of white fox furs on 
the sled. “You, you let them 
beat me like a dog. 

“See, Grandfather!” Peterluk 
hurled away the fox furs which 
had concealed the angakok. 
“They are climbing on their 
ship. They are lifting my seal 
demon on to their ship. They 
have stolen my seal demon. They 
have beaten me like a dog. You, 
you have done nothing! 

“Grandfather! You let them 
beat me!” Peterluk yelled. “Like 
a dog they beat me, like a dog!” 
Peterluk kicked the sled, and 
the angakok groaned, turning on 
its side, its back to Peterluk. 
Under its misshapen caribou 
skin parka, its huge hump quiv- 
ered like the belly of a woman 
whose birthtime has come. 

“Grandfather, why didn’t you 
burn them? You couldn’t bum 
them. You can’t even burn me. 
Your magic is gone. Dying thing, 
get off my sled!” 



Peterluk raised his whip han- 
dle. “Get off my sled! This per- 
son will take his wife, his son, 
his furs, his food, his tent — and 
leave this bad island. And leave 
you to starve! Die!” 

Vaguely, Peterluk’s ears heard 
the dogs whimpering. Inside Pet- 
erluk’s head the angakok’s pic- 
ture-thought writhed. 

“Get off my sled!” Peterluk 
shrieked. The angakok sat up. 

“You can’t reach me with your 
magic.” Peterluk felt a coldness 
at his back. “You are no anga- 
kok. Your magic has leaked 
out — ” 

Something in Peterluk’s head 
turned him toward the white- 
men’s ship. Peterluk’s bones 
melted. His wide jaw sagged as 
he fell to his knees with awe. 
For the ship was sinking! 

Already the dark water of the 
lead formed across its low deck- 
Instead of leaping overboard to 
save themselves, the whitemen 
were climbing down the smoke- 
hole into the cabin, vanishing 
into the sinking ship. 

Peterluk moaned with awe. 

A bubbling roar rose against 
Peterluk’s eardrums as the tall, 
gray cabin sank down. The ship’s 
stubby mast sliced downward 
through the water until only its 
topmost knob survived, swiveling 
desperately from side to side, 
glittering like a drowning eye. 
and then it, too, was gone.

GALAXY 



AbjectiLy, Peterluk crawled 
toward tiie powerful angakok. 
Not a single whiteman had been 
allowed to escape. With his own 
eyes, Peterluk had seen them all 
destroyed. As easily as if it had 
been a skin kayak, the angakok 
had sunk the whitemen’s ship. 

A faint picture of himself 
driving the loaded sled back to 
the tent entered Peterluk’s 
throbbing head. 

“Yes, yes, at once, Grand- 
father!” 

V 

■\ l^hen they reached the shore, 
^ ’ Peterluk yelled at his wife 
to come out. “Quickly, woman. 
Help me get him on to his feet. 
Careful now! My Grandfather 
has just sunk the whitemen’s 
ship and he is very tired.” 

Inside the tent, the angakok 
staggered against the sky iron. 
His weight was too much for 
them both to support. He fell 
heavily, like an iceberg from the 
face of a glacier, he fell. 

Peterluk looked down. “My 
Grandfather, is he dead?” 

Already the huge face seemed 
to be withering. 

Peterluk’s wife screamed. 

On the angakok’s back the 
great hump was splitting. Open- 
ing, it drooled slime. A slippery 
thing poured out as long as a 
man. 



Gleaming, it writhed, sat upi' 
pawed at its slime-clogged eyei 
with one hand — five fingers. Its 
wide open eyes stared up at 
them. It stood up as tall as Pet- 
erluk — and smiled. 

“Look,” Peterhik’s wife gasp- 
ed. “This Eskimo man, he looks 
like you!” 

With a quick motion the naked 
Eskimo walked as if he had been 
in the tent brfore. He reacheci 
for the ptarmigan rag behind the 
seal lamp and began to wipr- 
the slime from his body. 

“Like you — ” Peterluk’s wife 
marveled, and Peterluk moved 
forward. “He looks like you.” 

“Utak?” Peterluk asked, nam- 
ing one of his dead brothers, for 
infant mortality among the Els- 
kimo is high. “Ohud-lerk? Ar- 
luk?” 

“Edwardhik?” he asked th* 
smiling young man. Edwardluk 
had been Peterluk’s oldest broth- 
er, born dead nine summers be- 
fore Peterluk was bom, but Pet- 
erluk remembered the name and 
circumstances as they had been 
told to him by his father. 

The young man cocked his 
head, and seemed to ponder this 
name for a moment, his eyes 
narrowing although his smile re- 
mained wide. 

Then the young man replied 
in a voice like Peterluk’s, speak- 
ing the tribal mixture of Eskimo 
words and thoughts mixed with 



DEATH AND BIRTH OF THE ANGAKOK 



55 



whitemen’s expressions as per- 
fectly as Peterluk did, and ex- 
tended his hand in a ceremonial 
handshake. 

“This person is Edwardluk, 
your oldest brother,” the young 
man answered. His hand was 
warm and very strong. “Eh-eh, 
yes-yes, born nine summers be- 
fore you,” the naked young Es- 
kimo laughed. Being older, it 
was evident that he must be 
wiser and stronger than Peter- 
luk, more influential, a man to 
be listened to. 

Edwardluk turned his head. 
“Woman, get me my brother’s 
other parka. Quickly, w/oman! 
We must break camp.” 

He smiled at Peterluk. “My 
brother, you must sledge the — 
the sky iron far out on to the ice 
and upset it into the water. 
Eh-eh, we will make it disappear 
forever. We don’t need it any- 
more. This thing also, the body 
of — your Grandfather, we don’t 
need it either.” 



Edwardluk glanced down at 
the huge, shriveled body, then 
whirled at Peterluk’s wife. “Hur- 
ry up, you stupid woman, find 
me mukluks for my feet. There 
is much to be done.” 

He smiled at Peterluk. “My 
brother, we must hunt — kill 
much meat. This is a big planet. 
Many Eskimos will be born, all 
hungry!” 

Peterluk grinned with embar- 
rassment and pleasure. It was 
good to have a brother. Scratch- 
ing himself, Peterluk marveled 
how much his brother resembled 
— himself. 

“Eh-eh,” Peterluk giggled. The 
only difference was the small 
hump growing on his brother’s 
back. 

His brother’s friendly arm 
closed around Peterluk’s shoul- 
ders. He laughed into Peterluk’s 
ear. “Eh-eh, soon many sons, 
many daughters to feed. In a few 
seasons we Eskimos will fill this 
planet.” —HAYDEN HOWARD

BY WILLY LEY 

SYMBOLICALLY 

SPEAKING 

T here are symbols and sym- 
bols, of course. 

One kind is the symbolic ex- 
pression in speech or in writing 
where a statement is made for 
the purpose of conveying some- 
thing else. A virtually perfect 
example of such writing is a small 
but old book known as the Psy- 
siologus that was composed by; 



57 



an otherwise unknown early 
Christian writer for purposes of 
meditation. 

The first paragraph of that 
book deals with the lion which is 
said to “have three qualities”. 
The first is that it erases its 
tracks with its tail, so that the 
hunters cannot follow. The sec- 
ond is that it sleeps with its eyes 
open and the third that it is 
born dead but that, after three 
days, its father breathes into its 
face and it then comes to life. 

These three “qualities”, the 
book goes on to explain, have 
their meanings : the first one 

means that the incarnation of 
Christ is a mystery that cannot 
be fathomed. The second quality 
means that, while the body of 
Christ was dead, his divine spirit 
was awake in heaven and the 
third, of course, refers to the 
resurrection after three days. 

But there is also the “sym- 
bolic expression” that has the 
purpose of creating a mystery 
where there is none. The alche- 
mists excelled in that kind of 
symbolism by using descriptions 
for which the term circumlocution 
is not quite strong enough. When 
they spoke of the “dried blood 
of a blue-gray dove” they 
meant a bright orange-red pow- 
der that could be derived from 
bluish-gray lead. Plumbers and 
fitters of our time just call it “red 
lead”, and a chemist would refer 



to it as Pb304. That kind of 
symbols, which are really abbre- 
viations, is the kind I intend to 
discuss. 

B efore going on to symbols 
that could be spelled out if 
it were desirable or convenient, 
a few symbols that could not be 
spelled out have to be men- 
tioned, mainly because they are 
very old. 

In order of age they are; the 
six-pointed star constructed of 
two triangles and known as tlie 
star of David. It symbolizes 
Judaism as the cross symbolizes 
Christianity and the crescent and 
star symbolizes Mohammedan- 
ism. Two other old Christian 
symbols are the so-called Chris- 
mon, the intertwined P and X 
and the simplified drawing of a 
fish, both being symbols for 
Christ. Both are Greek in origin, 
the Chrismon just combines the 
Greek letter “ch” (which looks 
like an X) and the “r” (which 
looks like a P) ; while the fish 
is the result of an acrostic. The 
Greek words “Jesus Christos, 
God’s Son, Savior” spell ichthys, 
the Greek word for “fish”. 

When it comes to the question 
of the oldest non-religious sym- 
bols that are still in use, I am not 
going to accept the statement; 
the letters you are using right 
now. Of course letters are sym- 
bols in that they stand for 



58 



GALAXY 



sounds, but for purposes of this 
column we have specified that 
symbols are abbreviations, like $, 
that could be spelled out if one 
wanted to do so. Now the early 
printers in the sixteenth century 
invented many abbreviations, 
mainly for the purpose of ex- 
pressing Latin word endings like 
. orum . , umque and so 
forth by single signs. The only 
one of these so-called contrac- 
tions that is still in use is the 
ampersand ( 85 ). If you put it 
on its side you’ll discover that 
it is an intertwined e and t, mean- 
ing et, Latin for “and” or “also”. 

But since we have defined 
symbols as something that could 
be spelled out, the ordinary fig- 
ures have to be regarded as sym- 
bols. Of course every early civili- 
zation evolved its own way of 
writing figures. There was an 
Egyptian system, a Mayan sys- 
tem and many more. Some lan- 
guages, notably Hebrew and 
classical Greek, did not invent 
separate signs for figures, but 
assigned number values to their 
normal letters. 

An example of classical Greek 
usage is given in Fig. 1. It is the 
system used by Ptolemy in his 
famous work on astronomy and 
those of my readers who are 
familiar with the Greek alphabet 
may wonder about a few of the 
letters, namely those designated 
6 , 90 and 900. These signs are

Fig. 1. The development of the number signs. 
Ptolemy's system for writing thousands 
was to use a lower case letter preceded 
by a comma, the beta would then repre- 
sent 2000, the gamma 3000 and so forth. 
Even though a sign for zero existed, the 
idea of positional notation did not occur 
to the Greeks. 

letters that were already obsolete 
in the time of Ptolemy, the one 
designating 6 is called the dig- 
amma when a capital and stigma 
when lower case. When still used 
in writing by old-fashioned peo- 
ple in Ptolemy’s time the stigma 
was a symbol in itself, serving as 
a contraction for the letters sig- 
ma and tau (hence its name). 
The 80 symbol bears the name 
qoppa and the 900 symbol Is 
called sampi, both letters dis- 
appeared early as letters, but 
were retained for figures because 
the Greek alphabet in its later 
form did not have enough letters. 



FOR YOUR INFORAAATION 



59 



I f you read in a book that: 
(a + b)2 — a^ + 2ab + b^ your 
recollection of just when and 
why you were taught this for- 
mula may be hazy, but you are 
not in doubt for even a moment 
that the + means “add” and that 
= means “is equal to” and that 
a^ stands for a x a or aa. Sym- 
bols like these are necessarily 
the result of agreement and con- 
vention, but even a convention 
has to be introduced by some- 
body. Who decided that + should 
be used to mean “add”? 

All the mathematical signs we 
now use originated during a re- 
latively short period beginning 
in 1500, that is soon after the 
invention of printing. Prior to 
the year 1500 all required arith- 
metical operations had usually 
been spelled out, manuscripts 
stated in words that you should 
add this and multiply that and 
that the correct result would be 
such and such. 

One of the first to decide that 
this was a nuisance was the 
Italian mathematician Lusa Pa- 
cioli, also known as Luca di Sor- 
go, 1450-1520. In his own works 
he used the sign p to expr^s 
the instruction to add, the line 
over the letter had the purpose of 
indicating that this was an opera- 
tional sign, not a factor. For sub- 
traction he used m or de (for 
demptus, in the sense of “dimin- 
ished” or “reduced”). 



The idea of using symbols to 
indicate mathematical operations 
seems to have been applauded 
at once, but at first there was 
agreement on the principle only, 
not on the signs to be used. 
Pacioli’s compatriot and near 
contemporary Niccolo Tartaglia 
(1500-1557) used the sign 0 to 
mean “plus”, while he used the 
minus to indicate division. The 
sign 0 has survived on engineer- 
ing drawings of continental Eu- 
ropean and Japanese origin, con- 
fusing American engineers who 
usually need a little time to dis- 
cover that this is not supposed to 
be a Greek letter but just means 
“diameter”. 

During the second half of the 
sixteenth century the sign for 
addition was usually a capital 
P with a horizontal line drawn 
through it under the loop. By 
1600 a number of German and 
Swiss mathematicians left off the 
loop and the + sign had been 
born. At the same time they 
agreed on the single line — as 
the sign for minus. The multipli- 
cation sign X was introduced by 
the English mathematician Wil- 
liam Oughtred in 1631. During 
the same year his compatriot 
Thomas Harriot advocated the 
centered dot • for the same pur- 
pose. Both are stiU in use, the 
X usually in elementary books 
and the • in more advanced 
works. Unfortunately British

printers now often use the cen- 
tered dot to indicate the decimal 
point — I wish they would stop, 
if only to save my correspon- 
dence because my American 
printed books naturally use it as 
the sign for multiplication. 

'T^homas Harriot also introdu- 
ed the signs < and > re- 
spectively for “smaller than” and 
“larger than” and started writing 
a^ and a^ for aa and aaa. His 
sign for equality was the horizon- 
tal 8 which John Wallis, in 1655, 
used as the sign for infinity, de- 
fined as either the largest pos- 
sible integer or else as the sum 
of all integers. Of course this 
is still the sign for infinity, while 
= is the sign for equality, first 
so used by the Englishman Rob- 
ert Recorde in 1557. The German 
Wilhelm (Holtzmann) Xylander 
used a double vertical line as the 
sign for equality — but even his 
compatriots soon switched over 
to Recorde’s = which could not 
be mistaken for a Greek capital 
Pi. 

The sign for division was 
advocated simultaneously by 
Johann Henrich Rahn of Zurich 
and John Pell of London in 
about 1660. It is still in use in 
English-speaking countries while 
the other European countries and 
the Soviet Union use the simple 
colon ( : ) as the sign for division. 
The root sign goes back to Ru-

dolff in 1526, it is simply a spe- 
cial form of the written r (be- 
cause of radix, Latin for root) 
just as the integral sign is a spe- 
cial form of the letter s (summa). 

Letters having one meaning 
only are a sub-division of mathe- 
matical symbols. In 1728 the 
Swiss mathematician Leonhard 
Euler decided to designate the 
basis of the natural logarithms 
(2.718 . .) as e. It may be of 
interest to note that this thought 
occurred to him while he was 
thinking of a mathematical de- 
scription of the processes taking 
place when a cannon is discharg- 
ed. Another such definite letter 
is the /, standing for the square 
root of minus 1, and, of course, 
the Greek letter pi for the ratio 
of a circle’s circumference to its 
diameter. The use of pi was first 
suggested by Christian Goldbach 
in 1742 but gained currency 
mainly because Euler accepted

this usage in his main work that 
was printed in 1748. 

If you think that the letter c 
(for the velocity of light) is 
equally exclusive you happen to 
be wrong. Einstein’s use of it in 
his formula E=mc^ could not do 
away with aU the other uses of 
c. In treatises on aerodynamics 
it stands for the speed of sound, 
in works on rocketry it denotes 
the exhaust velocity and in some 
meteorological formulas it stands 
for the wind velocity. 

Even an established symbol 
can acquire a special meaning. 
Normally the dagger (•!•) is a 
reference to a footnote, but in 
paleontological books it means 
that the species marked by a 
dagger is extinct. And in biologi- 
cal works the astrological sym- 
bols used for Mars and Venus 
(we’ll get to them in a moment) 
are used to denote “male” and 
“female”. 

'"T^he next science where ssrm- 
-*• bols are often used (though 
far less frequently than in mathe- 
matics) is astronomy. The signs, 
all of them of astrological origin, 
are not very numerous, (see 
Fig. 2.) There is one for each 
planet and there are twelve signs 
for the twelve constellations of 
the zodiac. The other constella- 
tions, fortunately, have no signs. 

Both the signs for the planets 
and the custom of assigning a 

62 



metal to each planet go back to 
classical antiquity, we can no 
longer tell who first drew the 
sign for Venus or who designated 
copper as the metal to go with 
that planet. But we can still 
tell what these symbols repre- 
sent. The one for Mercury is a 
stylized drawing of the cadu- 
ceus, the staff with the two 
snakes which Mercury carried 
with him when one of the other 
gods sent him on a long journey. 
The symbol for Venus is a hand 
mirror, vanity is not a recent 
invention. The symbol for Mars 
is composed of shield and spear 
while that for Jupiter is a spe- 
cial form of the letter Z (from 
Zeus). The symbol for Saturn is 
a stylized hand sickle, for Saturn 
was the god of agriculture. The 
symbols for the three planets 
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were 
introduced soon after their dis- 
coveries to maintain tradition.

Uranus, discovered by Sir Wil- 
liam Ilerschel, is usually desig- 
nated by the symbol shown in 
the illustration, but in older 
books you can find the other 
symbol, the one incorporating a 
capital H, standing for Herschel’s 
name. The reason for this sym- 
bol is tills : after the planet Nep- 
tune had been discovered on the 
basis of the calculations made 
by the Frenchman Leverrier, 
Leverrier’s superior, D.F.J. Ar- 
ago, felt that the new planet 
should be called Planet Leverr- 
ier. To make this suggestion 
more palatable to other astron- 
omers he proposed to call Uran- 
us Planet Herschel. 

Opposition to this suggestion 
was virtually unanimous and 
Leverrier himself quickly voted 
for Neptune as the name of the 
new planet. Neptune, of course, 
got the classical trident as its 
symbol, and the symbol for Ur- 
anus was changed by leaving out 
the H. Pluto’s symbol has a 
double meaning. PL are the first 
two letters of the name and they 
are also the initials of Percival 
Lowell, who initiated the search 
that finally (after his death) 
culminated in the discovery of 
the planet. 

Most of the symbols for the 
constellations of the zodiac are 
also ancient, but the stylized ver- 
sions now in use are fairly re- 
cent. During the late Middle 



Ages and afterwards artists com- 
peted with each other in pro- 
ducing the most elaborate draw- 
ings of the animals that they 
could manage, in fact they are 
usually so elaborate that one has 
trouble finding the stars. As re- 
gards the derivation of the styl- 
ized symbols the interpreter is 
sometimes on firm ground, but 
only sometimes. 

''T^he first constellation of the 
zodiac, Aries (the Ram) is 
easy, the symbol is obviously a 
stylized drawing of a ram’s horns. 
The same goes for the second 
sign, Taurus (The Bull), the 
symbol is a stylized bull’s head. 
Gemini (The Twins) is also sim- 
ple, it is a Roman II. The fo irth 
sign. Cancer (The Crab) pre- 
sents some difficulties, a French 
historian of science guessed that 
it may be the crab’s claws. 

I feel that I can do a little 
better, the sign points in two 
directions and it originated in 
Europe where the most common 
representative of these animals 
is the crayfish. A crayfish, 
on land, will crawl forward, 
in water it will go backward and 
this fact is incorporated in sev- 
eral proverbs. (It is even incor- 
porated in music, during the 
eighteenth century a melody 
which sounded the same, wheth- 
er played from beginning to end, 
or from end to beginning, was

referred to as a “crabwise melo- 

dy”.) 

The next sign, that of Leo 
(the Lion), bears a symbol much 
used in alchemical writings and 
called the “dragon’s head”, but 
I think that it is simply a capital 
Greek lambda, since the Greek 
word for lion also starts with an 
L {Icon). The S5rmbol for Virgo 
(the Virgin) has not been ex- 
plained, but it could be 
Christian symbolism since it 
dearly incorporates the letter M, 
standing for Mary. Libra (the 
Scales) is obviously a simplified 
drawing of an old-fashioned 
hand-held pair of scales. The 
symbol for Scorpios (the Scor- 
pion) is unexplained, though the 
scorpion’s tail is evidently part 
erf it. Sagittarius (the Archer) is, 
of course, symbolized by an ar- 
row. The symbol for Capricornus 
(The Goat) defies explanation, 
unless it is supposed to express 
the jumps of a mountain goat. 
(When drawn artistically the ani- 
mal used to represent Capricor- 



nus was usually the ibex of th* 
Alps.) Aquarius (the Water Car- 
rier) is neatly symbolized by 
waves while the symbol for 
Pisces (the Fishes) at least ex- 
presses that there is more than 
one. 

And now we come to the 
science that uses symbols about 
as extensively as does mathe- 
matics: chemistry, where a sym- 
bol saying H2SO4 (sulphuric 
acid) is as definite and unequiv- 
ocal as any mathematical form- 
ula. 

The predecessors, at least 
chronologically, of the chemists, 
the alchemists, just loved to in- 
dulge in symbols. Fig. 3 shows 
a collection of alchemical sym- 
bols for some metals and a few 
common substances. (For Figs. 
3, 4 and 5, I am indebted to an 
article Development of Chem- 
ical Symbols by Prof. Ingo W. 
D. Hackh which appeared in 
The Scientific Monthly for 
March, 1935.) The first vertical 
row of these symbols is always 
the astrological sign of the cor- 
resiK)nding planet in the case of 
metals. The symbols for “water” 
are either waves, the second and 
third, or downward pointing ar- 
rows and triangles (rain) while 
the things that look like windows 
may also refer to rain and the 
necessity for staying indoors. The 
symbols for arsenic include cross- 
es, triple crosses and a cross

surmounted by a triangle (roof 
or tombstone) because of its 
toxicity. 

A pparently the first man who 
tried to bring some system 
into symbols used for chemical 
substances was the Swede Olov 
Bergman (1735-1784). He used 
the planetary symbols for those 
metals which traditionally were 
assigned to a planet, invented 
new symbols for metals discov- 
ered after 1500 (platinum, cobalt, 
zinc, etc.) and added symbols 
for concepts such as acid, alkali, 
regulus and chalx. The latter two 
terms were based on the then 
current phlogiston theory which 
ruled the field until oxygen had 
not only been discovered but its 
actions were also understood. 
When Bergman spoke of the re- 
gulus of silver he meant the un- 
combined metal, while Chalx of 
mercury was used to designate 
what we would now call the oxide 
of mercury. 

By using symbols indicating 
compounds, Bergman anticipat- 
ed the chemical formula. 

The man who continued this 
process was John Dalton (1766- 
1844) who did several things, 
(see Fig. 5.) Each element was 
represented by a circle with clear 
geometrical design, or with a let- 
ter, after Dalton had run out of 
designs that were simple enough 
not to be confused with others.

Fig. 5. The chemical symbols of John Dalton 
(1803). 

Note that Dalton, in labelling the iron 
atom !, the silver atom S and the gold 
atom G used the English and not th* 
Latin names of the metals. 

But the important thing was that 
in Dalton’s scheme the circle 
with a dot in the center no long- 
er meant hydrogen in general. It 
meant an atom of hydrogen, 
just as in present chemical for- 
mulae, here a C also does not 
mean carbon in general, but very 
specifically a carbon atom. 

By the time Dalton published 
his New System of Chemical 
Philosophy (1808) the concept of 
the molecule had not yet been 
advanced by Amadeo Avogadro, 
hence Dalton considered that 
water consisted of one atom of 
oxygen and one of hydrogen. As 
can be seen from the illustration 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

Dalton undertook to picture fair- 
ly complicated compounds. That 
he happened to be wrong more 
often than he was right is fairly 
unimportant; mistakes are a cus- 
tomary item in the progress of 
science and they are valuable 
items if they, as in Dalton’s case, 
pioint in the direction of their 
correction. 

One man who did much to 
correct these early mistakes, 
Baron Jons Jacob Berzelius, also 
invented the system of chemical 
notations which we use today, 
designating each element by a 
letter or two letters, since not 
every name of an element begins 
with a different letter. 

But in this century there was 
one belated attempt to revive 
drawn symbols. It originated 
with a German high-school teach- 
er who held the opinion that such 
symbols, while not a contribu- 
tion to chemical science, would 
contribute to the elementary 
teaching of chemistry. His sym- 
bols (Fig. 6) were based on the 
valence of the elements. Every- 
thing that had a valence of 1 
took the shape of an arrow, 
everything with a valence of 2 
had two “handles” (like the sym- 
bols of beryllium and oxygen), 
everything with a valence of 3 
was triangular and so forth. The 
illustration shows the first ten 
elements and a number of simple 
compounds.

'^he criticism levelled imme- 
diately against this sugges- 
tion was that the symbols could 
not be pronoimced, or rather 
that, in order to pronounce them, 
one would have to use the Ber- 
zelius notation and that there 
was, therefore, no need for extra 
symbols. To that criticism an- 
other one can be added, namely 
that the figures for the com- 
pounds would rapidly get so dif- 
ficult that one would need a 
long time to find out just what 
is under discussion. The symbol 
for H3BO3 (shown) is stiU rea- 
sonable, but H2B4O7 (tetraboric 
acid) would already be difficult 
and I did not even attempt to 
construct the symbolic picture 
of beryl, Be3AL2(SiOs)e. 

Near the beginning of this 
column I used a symbol which 
fitted the discussion but which 
I failed to explain. It was the 
$ sign.

GALAXY 



Its origin goes back to 1519 
when the Count von Schlick was 
put in charge of minting opera- 
tions, using the metal from a 
then newly discovered and rich 
silver mine at St. Joachim’s Dale 
in Bohemia. In German this is 
Joachimsthal and the large shiny 
silver coins which were made 
quickly called Joachimsthaler. 
Then the word was abbreviated 
into Thaler, which in Low Ger- 
man changed into Daler and 
from there into Dollar. Soon a 
Thaler or Daler did not have to 
come from Joachimsthal any- 
more to be called that, any silver 



coin of about the right size was 
called a Daler. 

Both the name and the coin 
were widely known when the 
United States came into being 
and made a large silver coin, 
called Dollar, the unit of its 
monetary system. 

But what does that have to do 
with $? Well, since the dollar was 
not exclusively a coin of the 
United States it had to be re- 
ferred to as U.S. Dollar in order 
to avoid misunderstandings. And 
it is believed that $ evolved from 
the letters U.S. superimposed on 
each other. — WILLY LEY

Robert Sheckley, absent from our pages for all too many years, comes 
back next issue, and comes back big. The story is Mindswap. In it a typical 
American youth (he's 40) of the 22d century, bored with the humdrum rounds 
of his existence (camping in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, skiing at 
the South Pole), seeks adventure out in space, and gets it by exchanging 
minds with a Martian. Nothing unusual about that . but the Martian is a 
criminal, and what happens to Our Hero thereafter is fast, funny, bright 
and colorful. It is, in a word, typical Sheckley. It's a complete novel, and 
we think you're going to put it right up there with Watcbbird, The Journey 
of Joenes and all the other Sheckley classics. 

Willy Ley's column is a beauty, too, dealing with the race to the Moon 
and its surest prize, an unmatchable site for an astronomical observatory. 
What it would be like, and what we can expect from it, are his themes in 
next month's For Your Information — and we've asked a few first-rate as- 
tronomers, including Donald H. Menzel and Robert S. Richardson, to add 
their own views and comments. We're pleased with the result.

equipped with armored legs and

Luckily, thought Tom, the 
Hugwos did not understand Eng-

talking at the moment. Lucy was 
blonde and beautiful and he 
loved her dearly, but — 

“I do!” said Tom. “You don’t

be above suspicion. As ambassa- 
dor to Mul’Rahr, I may have to 
engage in some pretty active 
diplomatic trickeries. If you don’t 
know about them, no one can 
accuse you — ” He broke off. A

fifth Hugwo, the corporal in 
charge of the honor guard of 
lance-gunners, had just clanked 
in with a message in code, which 
he handed to Tom. “Thank you.” 

“Sir!” shouted the corporal, 
clanked backwards three paces, 
saluted with the precision for 
which these mercenary soldiers 
were famous, and became rigid. 
Both he and Tom had spoken the 
lingua franca of the civilized 
worlds of the Galactic Federa- 
tion, to which the human worlds 
were relative newcomers. Tom 
scanned the message, translating 
mentally as he read. He had had 
the recent codes hypnoed into 
him before leaving Earth. 

ttT keep telling you,” Tom 
went on to Lucy in English 
as he read, “how serious this is. 
We overextended our human re- 
sources when we took over the

“But you took over the Jaktal 
seat for us among the forty-three 
great interstellar powers in this 
sector.”** said Lucy, puzzled. “I 
thought — ” 

“That gave us political posi- 
tion. But we need economic posi-

rused the message. “The Office

things — decided this could be 
best gotten by investing in the 
advantages of future trading 
agreement with the Wockii, the 
dominant race on Mul’Rahr. 
Against my advice, incidentally. 
It seemed to me there was some- 
thing fishy — ” 

“They asked you?” said Lucy. 

“Of course,” muttered Tom, 
still decoding as he talked. “After 
all. I’m the only living individ- 
ual of the human race who’s 
a member of the Interstellar As- 
sassin’s Guild, even if I am only 
an apprentice and became one 
by mistake. Because of my ap- 
prentice’s briefing, I know more 
about the interstellar situation 
than any human alive — oh, oh, 
just as I thought!” 

He snapped a pocket loset 
from his Assassin’s weapons har- 
ness and hastily disintegrated the 
message blank. 

“What? What did you think? 
Tell me!” said Lucy. 

“I shouldn’t,” muttered Tom, 
snapping the loset back into 
its holster clip. 

“You don’t trust me!” 

“But I will.” Tom began to 
pace worriedly up and down the 
room, between the statuesque 
Hugwos, with Lucy following 
after him. “It’s just as I feared. 
There’s been a wobble in Wockii 
futures on the Interstellar Fu- 
turities Exchange. A bad wob- 
ble.” 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



69 



“Wobble?” cried Lucy. “Wob- 
ble? I don’t understand.” 

“It’s not easy for anyone to 
understand without an Assassin’s 
briefing knowledge,” said Tom, 
frowning. “That’s why I warned 
the Office Upstairs against this.” 
“What did they do — oops!” 
said Lucy. Tom had just turned 
around suddenly and bumped 
into her. 

4 4 0orry,” said Tom. “Well, 
^ briefly, there’s a sort of 
interstellar stock exchange in 
whch member races can specu- 
late by buying and selling stock 
in their own and other races’ 
future wealth and productivity. 
When we took over the Jaktal 
empire we took over the Jaktal 
committments. In order to back 
these, the Office Upstairs de- 
cided to issue stock in our own 
human futures — all very good 
and sound as far as it went. But 
then, they turned around and 
wanted to borrow against the 
credit thus established to pur- 
chase the total stock of the 
futures of the dominant race 
here on Mul’Rahr, listed as the 
Wockiis. And I was sent here 
to endorse the purchase by a 
trade agreement with the Wock- 
iis personally, even though they 
haven’t reached Interstellar Cit- 
izenship level and are admini- 
strated by the Skikana, who dis- 
covered Mul’Rahr.” 



“But what’s wrong with that?” 
“Both the sixth and seventh of 
my para-instincts activated by 
the Assassin’s briefings were 
made suspicious by the avail- 
ability of those same Wockii fu- 
tures. My seventh, in particular, 
was very positive about it. It 
was all too easy and now we’re 
committed. The endorsing trade 
agreement is only a formality 
unless actual chicanery can be 
proved.” He stopped pacing. 
Lucy stopped too. 

“You think there’s been chi- 
canery?” Lucy stared at him. 

“No doubt of it. But can we 
prove it?” Tom shook his head 
worriedly. “That message just 
told me there’s been a sudden 
drop in the value of Wockii fu- 
tures on the Interstellar Ex- 
change. In one hour their value 
dropped fifteen points below the 
computer-predicted minimum le- 
vel for the next thousand years. 
A bad ‘wobble’ as the Exchange 
dealers put it.” 

“Then you mustn’t make the 
trade agreement. That’s all,” said 
Lucy firmly. 

“I can’t avoid it without rea- 
son.” Tom paused to glance at 
a screen across the room, which 
showed a wide expanse of con- 
crete landing pad and a battalion 
of what looked like six foot tall 
praying mantises armed and 
standing strictly at attention. 
“We’re almost down. There’s the

Skikana honor guard drawn up 
to greet us. From now on be 
careful what you say. Even a 
mountaintop ten miles away has

The landing bell of the ship 
rang suddenly through all the 
rooms, followed by the distant 
thrumming of what seemed like 
harp music. 

“What’s that?” cried Lucy. 

tC^'T^he Skikana battle harps,” 
said Tom. “You’ll see 
them when we go out. They vi- 
brate so powerfully they can be 
heard right through the hull of 
the ship. Come on now. We get 
off first. Protocol — Corporal!” 

“Sir!” shouted the Hugwo cor- 
poral, springing to life. He rap- 
ped out orders in Hugwo and 
the lance-gunners formed up be- 
hind Tom and Lucy and they 
all marched out of the suite, 
down the ship’s corridor and out 
through the airlock. 

“Be sure not to squint,” hissed 
Tom at Lucy in English as they 
went. “We’re stepping out of the 
lock into pretty bright sunlight, 
now. And Skikanas are extreme- 
ly touchy and proud. They take 
offense at the slightest provoca- 
tion.” 

They marched out and down 
the landing ramp, Lucy trying 
valiantly not to squint in spite 
of the sunlight that made the 



whole scene waver through a 
film of tears. They halted, their 
heads ringing with the powerful 
vibrations of the Skikana battle 
harps, great seven-foot triangu- 
lar, metal-stringed affairs, each 
resting on a spike driven deep 
into the very concrete itself. 

“. And may I also present 
my consort, the Consort Lucy, 
Colonel?” Lucy heard Tom say- 
ing. She cleared her vision in 
time to see a six-foot high pray- 
ing mantis shape leaning stiffly 
over her. 

“H-Honored to meet you, sir,” 
she managed in the sibilant 
Skikana tongue she and Tom had 
picked up on the way here. 

“Madame!” snapped the Ski- 
kana colonel, with a frosty bow. 
“May you dine on your worst 
enemy by sundown!” 

“Oh, thank you!” said Lucy. 
“May you dine on yours even 
sooner than that!” To her sur- 
prise she saw Tom frown. 

“Madame!” stiffening, the col- 
onel clashed his jaws together 
almost spasmodically. Oddly, a 
little froth appeared on them. 
“I would not presume! We Ski- 
kana take no advantages and 
need none. To dine before the 
consort of my guest. Skikana 
manners would not permit!” 
“Oh, I didn’t mean — ” Lucy 
was beginning. But Tom, with 
diplomatic smoothness, was al- 
ready stepping into the breach.

“Happily,” he said, “I may 
inform the Colonel that my con- 
sort has already broken her fast, 
this day.” 

“May I be the first to con- 
gratulate her, then!” said the 
colonel, relaxing. He relaxed, in 
fact, quite noticably, and his 
gaze came unfocused. He pulled 
himself together with a jerk and 
clashed his jaws spasmodically. 
“Follow me. I will escort you to 
your quarters.” 

He led them and their Hug- 
wos on to a waiting flying plat- 
form which took off just as the 
battle harps struck up again. 

II 

tC/^h, my!” said Lucy in Eng- 
lish, rubbing her ears 
when they were safely alone in 
their ambassadorial suite at the 
Skikana fort. “What was that 
they were playing?” 

“None Shall Interrupt Our 
Feast,” replied Tom. “Hmmm. 
Did you notice anything odd 
about the colonel?” 

“I couldn’t tell,” said Lucy, 
truthfully. “Everything he did 
and said seemed odd to me. 
Why were you humming?” 

“That song,’’ said Tom, 
thoughtfully. “The Skikana are 
so touchy they’re liable to give 
themselves away with anything 
they do. Something is definitely 
rotten about the whole business 



of Wockii futures. If there was 
only some way to get out of 
it—” 

“But can’t we do that? Just 
write off our losses?” asked Lucy. 

“It would break us,” said Tom, 
solemnly. “Our human worlds 
would be mortgaged and our 
future generations placed under 
a crushing load of financial obli- 
gation. If the Wockii futures turn 
out to be worthless we won’t be 
able to use them as security to 
meet our committments while 
we wait a thousand years for the 
Wockii to reach a civilized level 
and begin paying off in export- 
import agreements with us.” 

He frowned. “What puzzles 
me,” he said, “is the Skikana. By 
taking protectorate rights over 
the Wockii they gave up their 
right to any direct interest in 
Wockii futures. So they shouldn’t 
care one way or another about 
the matter — but obviously 
they’re mixed up in it somehow.” 

“Can’t you get them to give 
themselves away, somehow?” 
asked Lucy. “Betray themselves, 
I mean?” 

“A very good idea,” said Tom, 
thoughtfully. 

He stepped across the room to 
a communications screen, and 
pressed the buttons at its base. 
A second later the face of the 
Skikana colonel appeared on the 
screen. 

“Sir Ambassador!” said the 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES

colonel and champed his jaws. 
“In what may I serve you?” 
“You may supply me with an 
escort, my dear Colonel,” said 
Tom. “I, with my Hugwos and 
the Consort Lucy will start for 
Wockiiland, immediately.” 

The colonel stared out of the 
screen blankly at him for a mo- 
ment. 

“But sir Ambassador,” the 
Skikana said, “it has been ar- 
ranged for the Wockii chiefs to 
come to the fort, here.” 

“No doubt. However,” said 
Tom, with diplomatic steeliness 
in his tones, “I have concluded 
that it is of the utmost import- 
ance for me to contact — ” he 
bent a severe glance upon the 
colonel in the screen “ — the dom- 
inant race of Mul’Rahr, imme- 
diately.” 

“Sir!” The colonel’s jaws 
champed. “A banquet has been 
ordered.” 

“We shall appear at the ban- 
quet, but leave immediately 
afterwards. Good day,” said Tom, 
and cut the connection. 

I mmediately afterwards, how- 
ever, he activated the screen 
again, this time with a view out- 
side the fort gate looking back- 
v/ards into the wooded hills of 
the wild native countryside, to- 
ward Wockiiland. 

“What are you looking for?” 
asked Lucy, after a moment 

74 



“Watch. Wait,” said Tom, 
without turning his head. Lucy 
watched. After a moment or 
two, a platoon of Skikana sol- 
diers, mounted on individual fly- 
ing platforms, left the gate and 
skimmed with haste toward the 
hills. 

“The pot,” said Tom to Lucy, 
“is starting to boil. Clearly for 
some reason the Skikana want 
to warn the Wockii’s against my 
coming. Why? There must be 
something in Wockiiland they 
don’t want me to see.” 

The doors to their quarters 
gave forth a mellow chime, in- 
terrupting him. A second later 
the Hugwo corporal returned 
from answering it leading a Ski- 
kana captain of Regulars, lean 
and hard-bitten, but just at the 
moment with unfocused eyes. 

“Bells . .” murmured the 
captain, dazedly. 

“Sir!” shouted the Hugwo 
corporal to Tom, and the cap- 
tain came to. “Visitor to speak 
with the Ambassador, sir!” 

He saluted and stepped back. 
The captain bowed to Tom and 
Lucy. 

“Sir,” he said. “I am Captain 
Jabat of the 8th Skikana here 
at Fort Duhnderhef . Possibly you 
notice the medals on my pro- 
thorax?” 

“Indeed,” said Tom, his eyes 
narrowing. 

“They are poor things, no 
GALAXY 



doubt, in the eyes of an Assas- 
sin,” said Jabat, bowing grace- 
fully. “Nevertheless, I must con- 
fess to a nodule of pride in the 
medal on the far right. You see 
it there?” 

“Ah, y«s,” said Tom. 

“I received it,” went on Ja- 
bat, “on winning the champion- 
ship of the quick-draw-kill-and- 
devour, of the Skikana handgun 
competition at the last All-Skik- 
ana Worlds Games. As an Ass- 
assin, of course you are familiar 
with the Skikana handgunning 
art?” 

“Of course,” said Tom. 

“Then, for the pride of the 8th 
Skikana here at the fort,” said 
Jabat, “may I ask you to accept 
this small offering?” 

He produced a tiny gold whis- 
tle from his weapons harness and 
blew it. A Skikana enlisted sol- 
dier marched in bearing a silver 
dish with a cover which he plac- 
ed on a small table at Tom’s 
right. 

Bowing, both Skikanan with- 
drew. 

tt'nr'hey didn’t waste any 
time,” said Tom, as the 
door closed behind the two. He 
gazed with slitted eyes at the 
dish. “Develishly subtle, these 
Skikana.” 

“What did he give you?” in- 
quired Lucy, lifting the cover of 
the dish. “Oh—” 



“Don’t touch it!” said Tom, 
quickly. 

Lucy had revealed a beautiful 
competition model Skikana 
handgun. “If a human hand 
touches it, a signal will go off 
on the 8th Skikana bulletin 
board, and I’ll have accepted 
the challenge.” 

“Challenge?” Lucy jerked her 
hand back from the gun. “Tom! 
And he’s a champion! They’re 
trying to kill you!” 

“Nothing so crude, unfortun- 
ately,” said Tom. “What they 
must be planning is to discredit 
me. As an Assassin, they expect 
me to make short work of Jabat 
in the duel. However, having 
killed him, I must finish off the 
matter by ceremoniously eating 
every bit of him. It’s the final 
tribute to a fallen foe, according 
to the Skikana code duello. 
They’ve undoubtedly checked 
up and found that we humans 
haven’t the incredible Skikana 
capacity for food — even if Ski- 
kana were edible by human stan- 
dards.” 

He looked thoughtful. 

“If I refuse to eat him,” Tom 
said, “they undoubtedly plan a 
protest that will get me removed 
as ambassador. And no other 
human has my qualifications to 
see through what’s going on 
here.” 

“Don’t kill him, then,” urged 
Lucy. “Just — just scratch him.”

“I’m not sure I can,” said Tom, 
solemnly. “You forget. I’ve had 
the briefing, but I lack the years 
of intensive physical training 
that makes an Assassin. The Ski- 
kana don’t know it, but their 
champion can almost undoubt- 
edly take me. I’ll be dead before 
I can clear the handgun from 
its clip on my harness.” 

“Tom!” Lucy’s face was hor- 
rified. “Don’t you fight him! 
Don’t you fight him at all!” 

“An Assassin back away from 
a challenge? Impossible,” said 
Tom. “The Assassin’s Guild 
themselves would eliminate me 
if I did such a thing.” 

“Can’t you just tell him, some 
other time?” Lucy almost wrung 
her hands. “Be polite, but firm?” 
“No,” said Tom, sadly. “After 
all, whole armies have been 
known to mutiny and refuse to 
advance when they heard that 
a single Assassin barred their 
path.” He sighed, heavily. “Well, 
maybe I can think of some- 
thing. We better get going to the 
banquet.” 

Ill 

Ourrounded by their Hugwos, 
^ they left the suite, and were 
guided by an officer posted out- 
side their door down a corridor 
and into a vast, hall-like room 
v/ith a lofty, raftered roof and 
no windows except narrow slits 



up near the rafters at the top 
of the walls. These windows were 
set ajar, however, to the warm, 
sunset air of Mul’Rahr. Inside 
the hall great ceremonial torches 
eight feet tall flared and danced 
their flames above the long 
tables at which the Skikana of- 
ficers sat. Wide circular platters 
of polished wood sat before each 
diner or empty chair. And enor- 
mous toadstools like logs of wood 
gave up a savory smell like roast 
beef as they lay at length on the 
tables brt veen rows of plates. 

The Hugwo corporal conduct- 
ed Tom and Lucy to seats at the 
left of the Skikana colonel. 

“You have met our brave Cap- 
tain Jabat?” inquired the col- 
onel, as soon as the two humans 
were seated. 

“I have indeed,” replied Tom. 

“Even among we Skikana his 
courage is proverbial,” said the 
colonel. “He . .” his gaze wan- 
dered and his voice trailed off. 

“Colonel!” prompted Lucy, 
kindheartedly. 

The colonel started, forked a 
bite of toadstool into his mouth, 
gulped it down and came alert 
again. “. Ah, yes,” he said 
significantly, looking at Tom. “It 
is courage not even to be de- 
spised by an . Assassin, shall 
we say?” Lucy caught her 
breath. 

“We shall, to be sure,” said 
Tom smoothly. “But work before

pleasure, my dear Colonel. The 
Wockii concern me at the mo- 
ment.” 

The colonel inclined his head 
and signaled to a Skikana enlist- 
ed soldier, who stepped forward 
to carve slices from the nearest 
huge toadstool. He served the 
slices on the platters before Tom 
and Lucy. Lucy sniffed obtru- 
sively at hers. The aroma was 
delicious. 

“Is it safe for us to eat?” she 
whispered in English to Tom. 

“I’ll check,” whispered back 
Tom. The colonel’s attention was 
momentarily devoted to finishing 
his own slice and ordering an- 
other with typical Skikana vora- 
city. Tom produced a small 
handbook and thumbed through 
it. “Let’s see . ‘MuVRahr . 
toadstooloids of, large . Agari- 
ca MuI’Rahrens is Gigantica, 
page one hundred and forty- 
three . .’ Here it is . ‘See Rhu, 
page one-thirty-eighf . .” he 
flipped pages. “ ‘Rhu, a wide- 
spread root system often extend- 
ing over miles underground, put- 
ting forth root and tuberose pro- 
jections of many varieties and 
types’ . .” Tom’s voice trailed 
off. “Hmm . .” he muttered, 
“interesting . .” 

“But can we eat it?” demand- 
ed Lucy. 

“Oh!” Tom started, almost 
after the fashion of the colonel. 
“Yes, I think so . ‘edible for 



the following races . , Adjarts, 
Allahns, . uh, Hssoids, Hytszs 
. .’ Yes, here we are . ‘Hu- 
mans’.” 

“Oh, good, said Lucy, “it 
smells so appetizing — ” 

\ twang from high above in- 
terrupted her, followed by 
an approaching high-pitched 
drone and ending in a thud. A 
small black arrow quivered in 
the center of Lucy’s slice of toad- 
stooloid, pining it to the wooden 
platter. Shocked silence filled 
the hall and all eyes turned up- 
ward to discover a three-foot 
high, faunlike figure covered with 
white woolly hair and with a 
lamblike face. This figure stood 
perched on one of the rafters by 
an open window, now reslinging 
a small bow over its shoulder 
and drawing an eighteen-inch 
sword. 

“What — what is it?” gasped 
Lucy, unthinkingly in English. 

“A Flal,” answered Tom, swift- 
ly in the same language, “sup- 
posed to be one of the semi- 
intelligent local life forms — ” 

The rest of his sentence was 
drowned out by a bellow. 

“A Flal!” the colonel was 
roaring, starting to his feet and 
tugging at the ceremonial sword 
that was the only weapon the 
Skikana officers had worn to 
the banquet. “Get it down from 
there! Get it down, I say!” 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



77 



With a sudden, fantastic leap, 
the Flal left the rafter high over- 
head and landed on the table 
before the colonel. In a twin- 
kling, the Flal’s midget sword 
was menacing the colonel’s pro- 
thorax and an imperious whistle 
burst from the Flal’s lamblike 
lips. 

“Cut it down! That’s an or- 
der!” thundered the colonel to 
his officers. “Never mind me!” 
But the officers hesitated. 

Taking advantage of this hesi- 
tation, the Flal turned and di- 
rected a stream of angry, musical 
whistling at Tom, gesturing with 
its free hand at the nearest toal- 
stooloid. Then the Skikana of- 
ficers dashed forward and the 
Flal, releasing the colonel, dodg- 
ed away, ducking into the sea 
of three-foot long, flashing Ski- 
kana swords, twisting, swivel- 
hipping and dancing on black 
hooves as his own tiny blade, 
glittering with a speed of reflex 
the Skikana could not match, 
fenced a way for him to the 
nearest torch stand. 

A leap carried him to the top 
of the stand. From there, dis- 
dainful of the licking flame, an- 
other leap carried him to cren- 
ellations in the wall and from 
there to a rafter leading to an 
open window. At the window he 
turned about, and, whipping a 
miniature hunting horn from his 
belt, he paused to blow a blast 



like some small, elfin bronx cheer 
at those below. The Skikana 
soldiery howled in baffled fury, 
waving their weapons. Then the 
Flal had ducked through the 
window and was gone. 

tcQir Ambassador! Consort 

^ Lucy!” said the colonel, 
gnashing his jaws but sheathing 
his sword and getting himself 
back under control — he paused 
to gulp a half-slice of toalstool- 
oid — “please be seated. Forgive 
this minor interruption. These 
local life forms — mere semi-in- 
teUigent animals — not even a 
language, just whistle to show 
their emotional state — please 
put it out of your mind. My sol- 
diers will see that the banquet is 
not interrupted again.” 

“That won’t be necessary, col- 
onel,” said Tom. “I promised 
only to put in an appearance at 
this banquet and I consider that 
promise fulfilled now. I, my Con- 
sort, and my Hugwos will make 
use of that escort I asked you 
for, to leave for Wockiiland im- 
mediately.” 

“Of — of course!” said the col- 
onel, getting himself under con- 
trol. “If you wish it, sir Ambas- 
sador. The escort is provided. 
However — ” he hesitated. “I 
cannot permit the Consort Lucy 
to risk a night journey through 
the Mul’Rahrian wilds. You and 
the Hugwos, of course, but — ” 



78 



GALAXY 



“Sir!” Tom’s voice snapped 
him off in mid-speech. “Are you 
presuming to tell me where to 
take my Consort?” 

“I have a duty,” said the col- 
onel stiffly, “as local commander 
to protect civilians — ” 

“May I remind the colonel?” 
Tom’s words cut like a knife. 
Lucy looked at him in admira- 
tion. “That the Consort Lucy 
will have an Assassin to escort 
her?” 

“Sir!” said the colonel, stiff- 
ening in his turn. “Am I to infer 
a lack of trust in my soldiers and 
myself.” 

“Certainly not,” said Tom, 
without hesitation, and Lucy 
beamed at him for his quick 
thinking. It was perfectly clear 
that if Tom had expressed a lack 
of trust in the Skikana, the col- 
onel would have had grounds for 
a protest to get Tom removed as 
ambassador. “I trust you and 
your officers and men impUcity, 
Colonel. It is the Consort Lucy I 
don’t trust.” 

Lucy gasped. 

“You don’t — ” the colonel’s 
naturally bulging eyes seemed to 
bulge farther, “ — trust your con- 
sort, sir Ambassador?” 

“Not out of my sight for a 
moment,” said Tom, firmly. “A 
purely human situation. Colonel. 
I’m sure you wouldn’t be inter- 
ested in the details. And now, 
the escort?” 




A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



79 



“It’s already waiting for you 
at the west gate,” said the col- 
onel, stiffly. Gnashing his jaws 
in defeat, he stepped back and 
allowed them both to proceed by 
him followed by their Hugwos. 

IV 

F ifteen minutes later, they 
floated westward on flying 
platforms over the rolling semi- 
wooded landscape of Mul’Rahr 
under the enormous single moon 
that made the night seem almost 
as bright as day. Tom and Lucy 
were sharing a platform, with 
their faithful Hugwos riding in- 
dividual platforms before and 
behind them. Beyond and behind 
the Hugwos were half a dozen 
platform mounted soldiers of the 
Skikana escort, none of whom 
seemed close enough to be in 
earshot. Tom lowered his voice 
and spoke to Lucy in English. 
“Lucy — ” he began. 

“Don’t speak to me,” said 
Lucy, staring off in the opposite 
direction at the shadowy woods. 
“Do not speak to me! I would 
appreciate it!” 

“Now Lucy — ” said Tom. 

“If you please,” said Lucy. 
“There is nothing for us to dis- 
cuss. Nothing at all.” 

“Don’t you understand?’’ 
pleaded Tom. “The colonel want- 
ed you as a hostage. I couldn’t 
leave you in his hands. I had to 



say the first thing that came into 
my head!” 

“No doubt,” said Lucy. “It 
was very clever of you. Curious, 
is it not, though, that you should 
make use of the fact that I am 
untrustworthy? I do not wish to 
make a point of this,” went on 
Lucy in syllables resembling 
splinters of jagged ice. “It mere- 
ly crossed my mind. In passing, 
so to speak.” 

“Lucy, I do trust you. You 
know I do!” 

“How bright the moonlight is 
upon this world,” said Lucy, 
splintering a little more ice. 

They rode in silence for the 
following forty minutes or so, at 
the end of which Tom tried 
again. 

“Lucy — ” he began. He broke 
off suddenly as he caught sight 
of the officer in charge of their 
escort whipping his flying plat- 
form about and zipping back to- 
ward the one Tom and Lucy oc- 
cupied. “Yes, Captain?” asked 
Tom, as the officer swung about 
and flew alongside. 

It was Captain Jabat. The 
moonlight glittered in his black 
eyes in what Lucy, at least, could 
not help but feel was a very 
sinister fashion. 

“Sir,” said the captain to Tom. 
“We approach the Wockii chiefs 
now. We should meet them in 
the next few seconds.” 

“Excellent. Tell me, Captain,” 



80 



GALAXY 



said Tom, thoughtfully. “Just as 
a matter of interest, was it a 
case of your original Skikana 
scoutship seeking out the Wockii, 
when they discovered Mul’Rahr? 
Or did the Wockii come forth 
on their own initiative to make 
friends with the scoutship?” 

CC'^p'he Wockii came forth on 
their own, sir,” said Ja- 
bat. “We consider it a tribute to 
our Skikana approachability, and 
honor. The Skikana honor is 
without stain. None may accuse 
us of being merciful in victory 
or resentful in defeat.” 

“To be sure,” said Tom. “How- 
ever, aside from that — would 
you tell me if the Wockii are a 
particularly truthful race?” 

“Hardly, my dear sir,” Jabat 
gave the low rasp of Skikana 
laughter. “We have a little say- 
ing at Fort Duhnderhef. The 
only Wockii that don’t lie are 
the dead Wockii, and even they 
lie about being dead.” Jabat 
rasped again. “You follow the 
joke, sir Ambassador and Con- 
sort Lucy? See, the Wockii lie 
when they’re alive, and when 
they’re flat on the ground, dead. ’ 

“Very humorous, Captain,” in- 
terrupted Tom. “Very humorous 
indeed. But isn’t that the Woc- 
kii Chiefs I see approaching 
now?” 

Jabat turned and looked up 
toward the head of the column. 



“You are right, sir Ambassa- 
dor,” he said. And, whipping his 
platform about, he shot off to 
meet the group that was ap- 
proaching on foot in the moon- 
light. 

In a moment the two parties 
had come together. The Wockii 
stood about nine-feet high. They 
looked something like enormous 
badgers with curved short tusks. 
They wore heavy, six-foot cut- 
lasses but nothing else except 
ribbons tied about their tusks. 

“Sir Assassin,” said Captain 
Jabat, presenting these hulking 
figures to the platform on which 
Tom and Lucy rode, “and Con- 
sort Lucy, may I introduce Hlu- 
gar. Chief of Chiefs for the 
Wockii.” 

Captain Jabat had spoken in 
Wockii, which Tom and Lucy 
had also learned by briefing ma- 
chine on the way to Mul’Rahr, 
as they had learned the Skikana 
tongue. 

“All hail, Hlugar!” said Tom, 
in Wockii. 

“All hail, foreigner!” grunted 
Hlugar in a deep bass voice that 
seemed to shake the bones of 
the two humans. “Welcome to 
Wockiiland. My burrow is your 
burrow.” 

“And my burrow is your bur- 
row. Let us go feast this happy 
occasion.” In a shrewd tone of 
voice he added, much to Lucy’s 
astonishment. “What shall we 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



81 



feast on? Perhaps — some roast- 
ed Flals?” 

Hlugar’s bass bellow split the 
moonlight of the Mul’Rahrian 
night. 

“Never!” he roared, dropping 
on all fours and beginning to dig 
frantically in the dirt before him. 
“Never eat Flals! Never, you 
hear?” He thrust his tusked muz- 
zle down into the hole he had 
dug, roaring muffedly — “Never!" 

“Sir — ” began Jabat, in an 
outburst of indignation. But be- 
fore he could continue, sudden 
bedlam broke loose. 

Ohrill whistles sounded from 
the tree shadows on all sides 
of them. Small black arrows be- 
gan to drone among them. The 
booming bellows of the Wockii 
mingled with the harsh battle 
commands of the Skikana. 

There was a swirl of motion 
and little faun-like, hooved fig- 
ures with gleaming swords were 
all about them. Before Tom and 
Lucy could move, something like 
heavy cloths fell over their heads. 
They felt themselves picked up 
and carried off at a run. 

It was useless to struggle. 
They were carried for some dis- 
tance and gradually Lucy felt 
her senses slipping away from 
her. The cloth or whatever heavy 
material it was that was wrapped 
around her seemed to give off 
a pleasant, faint perfume with 



an anesthetic effect. She roused 
herself to struggle against it, 
but it was too late. She drifted 
off into unconsciousness. 

When she opened her eyes 
again, she was lying on the slope 
of a pleasant, grassy hillside. 
Dawn had just broken and the 
bright yellow sun of Mul’Rahr 
was rising in the blue sky direct- 
ly ahead of her. A little distance 
off stood Tom, facing some arm- 
ed Flals. Surprisingly, only a 
dozen feet or so away, the faith- 
ful Hugwos stood at attention, 
lance-guns in hand. 

. It’s no use,” Lucy heard 
Tom saying to the Flals. “I can’t 
understand a meaning-symbol 
you whistle.” He was speaking 
in Wockii, Lucy noted drowsily. 
She remembered that she was 
mad at him for some reason, but 
she felt so pleasant that she 
could not at the moment recall 
what she was supposed to be 
mad at him about. 

“Tom!” she cried faintly, try- 
ing to sit up. Tom turned, saw 
her stirring and hurried over. 

“I didn’t know you were 
awake,” he said, helping her to 
her feet. “You feel fine, don’t 
you?” 

“As a matter of fact, yes,” 
said Lucy, bewildered. “I do.” 

She got to her feet. “But what 

» 

“That was the veil, or under- 
membrane of the Rhu toad-

stooloid — Agarica M ul’ R ahren - 
sis Gigantica, the one they serv- 
ed us for dinner at the fort,” 
said Tom. “It appears to have 
shght narcotic as well as excel- 
lent analgesic and tranquilizing 
properties. But never mind that 
now. I’m finally beginning to get 
the general picture of the situa- 
tion here on Mul’Rahr, and it’s 
more desperate than I thought. 
Ordinarily as the consort of an 
ambassador, you’d be safe trust- 
ing in the Skikana sense of hon- 
or. But the Skikana here on 
Mul’Rahr, as I suspected when 
the colonel tried to hold you back 
as a hostage, are no longer to 
be trusted. They’re planning ac- 
tual genocide — but there’s no 
time to go into that now. Do you 
have your consort’s credentials 
with you?” 

(6/^f course,” said Lucy, sur- 
prised, reaching down into 
the small belt-purse of her dress. 
“You told me never to go any- 
where without them. I keep them 
right in — yes, here they are.” 
“Good!” said Tom, plucking 
the papers out of her fingers. 
He whipped a stylus out of its 
holster on his weapons harness 
and scribbled rapidly on the mar- 
gin of the topmost paper. He 
folded the papers and thrust 
them back at Lucy. “Put those 
back into your purse, there — ” 
Lucy obeyed, as he went on. “If 



you hear that anything’s hap- 
pened to me, you contact the 
nearest representative of the As- 
sassin’s Guild and show them 
what I’ve written. And — ” 

“Happen to you!” cried Lucy, 
her fingers freezing on the snap 
of the purse, which she had just 
reclosed. “What do you mean 
happen to you? What do you 
mean if I hear — ” 

“I’m sending you directly back 
to the landing field and the 
spaceship we came in on,” said 
Tom. “Now don’t argue — ” 

“I won’t argue!” burst out 
Lucy. “I just won’t go! You 
can’t make me! I’m not going to 
leave you!” 

“Yes, you are,” said Tom, ur- 
gently. “The Hugwos will see 
you safely back to the landing 
field.” 

A sharp whistle from the group 
of Flals interrupted him. He 
looked over at the small hooved 
figures and groaned. 

“Too late,” he said. “I’ll just 
have to hope that the Skikana 
have enough sense left to spare 
you when they attack. Come 
along, I’ve got to get back to 
these Flals.” 

“But attack? Why should the 
Skikana attack?” asked Lucy, 
bewilderedly, following him back 
toward the Flals. 

“Because this spot here is the 
place the Skikana have been 
searching for ever since they dis- 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



83 



covered the Wockii had lied to 
them about being tlie dominant 
intelligent race on Mul’Rahr. For 
the same reason the Flals kid- 
napped us and brought us here 
to help them.” 

“But why do you have to be 
the one to help them?” wailed 
Lucy. “Why can’t you leave? 
Then I’d go with you.” 

tcT^or me,” said Tom, solemn- 

-T ly. “There’s no choice. The 
galaxy knows that no Assassin 
could ever be kidnapped without 
his permitting it. You can’t kid- 
nap an Assassin. Kill one, yes, if 
you have sufficient battle-hard- 
ened troops and mobile armor. 
The only conclusion that can be 
drawn is that I allowed myself 
to be kidnapped by the Flals 
out of cowardice, in an attempt 
to avoid facing up to Jabat’s 
challenge — unless I can get to 
the bottom of things here and 
clear myself by showing what I 
was really trying to do.” 

“But . but, I don’t under- 
stand — ” 

Lucy broke off helplessly, star- 
ing at him as they stopped before 
the small group of Flals. Those 
small individuals were now look- 
ing up at Tom and Lucy inquir- 
ingly. Their little pink noses, 
furry faces, and kindly brown 
eyes were lit up by the golden 
rays of the rising sun. 

“I’m not completely sure I do. 



either,” said Tom. “I’m using 
my para-instincts and playing by 
ear as I go. These Flals have a 
high nobility-of-character index. 
My para-instincts assure me of 
that. But since their language, 
and they really do have one, is 
musico-emotional in base, I can’t 
understand the explanations 
they’ve been trying to give me. 
It’s as if they see the universe 
around them in terms of varying 
degrees of right or wrong and 
define those degrees in musical 
terms to make up their lan- 
guage.” 

“Oh,” said Lucy, looking at 
them with a softening glance, 
and remembering the single Flal 
in the banquet hall fighting off 
all the Skikana officers. “And 
they’re such brave little beings, 
too.” 

“That’s true, they are. And,” 
said Tom, “because of their na- 
tures, able to read the characters 
of others at a glance. They were 
able to sense, as a result, right 
from the start that we and the 
Hugwos are honorable. Just as 
they sensed from the beginning 
that the Skikana are cruel and 
rapacious; and they’ve always 
known, of course, that the Wockii 
were brutal and greedy.” 

“But if they want you to help 
them, but can’t tell you — ” Lucy 
was beginning, when a whistle 
from the closest Flal interrupted 
her. Tom turned to the Flal and 



84 



GALAXY 



whistled the first few bars of 
Mendelssohn’s Wedding March. 
The Flal turned to Lucy and 
bowed politely. 

“Why!” cried Lucy, delighted. 
“You can, too, talk to them!” 

itrf^nly after a fashion,” an- 
swered Tom. “I was try- 
ing to tell him that you’re my 
wife. Of course they’ve always 
said music was the universal lan- 
guage. But that’s an oversimpli- 
fication. In this case the concept 
of ‘wife’ probably missed him 
completely, in spite of the fact 
that the Flals, like us are bi- 
sexual. What he probably got 
were just some of the emotional 
overtones of our relationship.” 

“But you could work out a 
language from that sort of thing, 
couldn’t you?” inquired Lucy. 

“In time. But time is just what 
we don’t have — ” A silvery Flal 
horn sounded off among the giant 
toadstooloids and the trees at the 
base of the slope they stood on. 
A second later, another sounded 
from the far side of the hill. 
“There come the Wockii and the 
Skikana. Just as I’d hoped.” 

“Just as you’d hoped?” Lucy 
stared at him. 

“Yes,” said Tom. “I particu- 
larly need those Skikana battle 
harps.” He turned to the Flals 
and made pounding motions in 
the air with his fist. “Try the 
drum again,” he said in Wockii. 



The group parted and just be- 
yond them Lucy saw what seem- 
ed to be a drum mounted on a 
stake driven down into the earth. 
Two Flals began to beat the 
drum vigorously. It did not sound 
so loud in the air, but Lucy 
could feel the vibration of it 
through the ground at her feet. 
A sudden new chorus of whistles 
broke out below the slope. They 
all turned around and saw the 
first line of armed Skikana in- 
fantry march into view and 
pause at the foot of the slope. 
Mixed in among them were 
heavy Wockii figures carrying 
their mighty cutlasses in hairy 
fists. The Flals drew their 
swords. 

A strange sound vibrated all 
about the scene. 

“What was that?” cried Lucy. 
“It sounded like a yawn!” 

But Tom’s attention was di- 
rected down the hill towards the 
Skikana battle harpsmen, who 
were emerging from the trees in 
front of the troops and driving 
the supporting spikes of their 
harps into the earth so that the 
harps stood upright, ready to 
play. The Skikana colonel emerg- 
ed into view, with Captain Jabat 
marching correctly at his left and 
half a pace to his rear. Together 
and alone, they marched up the 
hill toward Tom, Lucy and the 
Flal leaders. Halfway up the 
slope the colonel said something 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



85 



to Jabat, who stopped and held 
his position midway there be- 
tween the forces of the Wockii 
and the Skikana. 

He came on up the slope and 
halted before Tom. 

V 

said stiffly. He stood 
‘^for a second, champing his 
jaws a little uncertainly as if he 
was having trouble remembering 
what he was going to say. “I 
must ask you to use your in- 
fluence with these Flals to cause 
them to surrender themselves so 
that we may dig up this area to 
discover goods reported stolen 
from our fort. Do not think of 
resistance, please. Your case is 
hope — What was that?” 
“Another yawn,” said Lucy. 
“Nonsense!” snapped the col- 
onel, sharply. Then, getting his 
voice under control, he gave a 
curt bow of apology in Lucy’s 
direction. “ — As I was saying, 
resistance would be useless. Your 
position on this slope is hope- 
less.” 

“Permit me,” said Tom, “to 
disagree with you, sir. The Flals, 
as your Skikana have cause to 
know, are not unworthy fighters 
in spite of their small size. All 
the galaxy knows the reputation 
of the Hugwo lance-gunners. 
And, last but not least, I am 
myself an Assassin.” 



“True,” said the colonel, 
champing his jaws convulsively 
once more. “However, I must 
inform you that your recent ac- 
tions in allowing yourself to be 
kidnapped by these Flals, here, 
have cast some grave doubts in 
our mind on your status as a 
true Assassin. No doubt they are 
groundless — ” 

“No doubt,” said Tom. “And 
no doubt I am mistaken in my 
conjecture that the supply of un- 
harvested toadstooloid is rapid- 
ly approaching the vanishing 
point?” 

The colonel staggered visibly, 
but pulled himself erect once 
more. 

“There’s plenty of toadstool- 
oid!” he snapped. 

“Plenty,” said Tom in steely 
tones, “for the native Flal and 
Wockii populations. After all the 
ecology was balanced that way. 
But not enough for these and a 
regiment of Skikana soldiery, 
when each soldier was capable 
of eating his own weight or more 
of food at a sitting. And more- 
over, once the effect of the toad- 
stooloid upon the Skikana eaters 
became known — ” 

“Stop!” shouted the colonel. 
“Assassin or not, I warn you. 
There are some secrets not meant 
to be uncovered.” 

“The secret,” said Tom, un- 
flinchingly, “has already been 
uncovered. It began when who- 



86 



GALAXY 



ever was fronting for you Ski- 
kana in the purchase of Wockii 
futures realized that those futures 
were worthless and made them 
available on such attractive 
terms that my human govern- 
ment snapped them up. This 
forced you to a situation where 
you had to seek out the true 
dominant intelligence of Mul’- 
Rahr and destroy it.” 

(Ct^ot true!” snapped the col- 
onel, frothing slightly at 
the jaws. “A pack of lies! The 
Flals are not intelligent! And no 
normal civilized race would dare 
the crime of genocide, even if — ” 
“The Flals are intelligent,” 
said Tom, relentlessly. “You 
found out the Wockii had lied to 
you about that shortly after you 
established your administration 
here on Mul’Rahr.” 

“Lies!” roared the colonel. “If 
that were true, we’d have made 
an agreement with the Flals at 
once, rather tlian risk prosecu- 
tion as a race violating Inter- 
stellar agreement. Why didn’t 
we?” 

“For the same reason,” said 
Tom, “that you Skikana station- 
ed here could contemplate the 
crime of genocide. You were not 
normal any longer. You — ” 
“Stop!” champed the colonel. 
“No,” said Tom. “It’s too late 
to hide the truth. Agarica MuV 
Rahrensis Gigantica, or the local 

A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 




87 




edible giant toadstooloid on 
which you, like the Wockii and 
the Flals, have been feeding is 
not dissimilar to the Agaricas 
muscarius, or fly agaric, one of 
the poisonous mushrooms of my 
own world.” Lucy gasped, but 
Tom went on without paying any 
attention to her. “MttVRahrensis 
produces a derivative of the alk- 
aloid muscarine. Which, however, 
acts not so much as a poison but 
as a narcotic, a tranquilizer and 
a euphoric. Taken in the small 
amounts of toadstooloid, a Flal, 
or even a Wockii individual, is 
capable of consuming at one 
time, the toadstooloid is merely 
a mild and harmless intoxicating 
food — ” 

“Stop!” said the colonel, his 
voice cracking in a very un- 
Skikana-like way. 

“But,” continued Tom relent- 
lessly, “taken in the enormous 
quantities in which the smallest 
Skikana soldier can consume at 
a sitting, the toadstooloid be- 
comes a powerful, habit-forming 
drug. A drug that the addict will 
go to any lengths to obtain and 
which no intelligent, civilized be- 
ing would allow another inteUi- 
gent being to consume — ” 

CtX rery well,” said the colonel. 

’ He had pulled himself 
together, and there was some- 
thing almost sad in his voice. 
“You would not let me stop you. 



Now you’ve sealed your own 
fate.” He turned and bowed to 
Lucy. “I regret. Consort Lucy,” 
he said, “that you must be in- 
cluded with the rest. No human, 
Hugwo or Flal must leave this 
spot alive.” He looked back sad- 
ly at Tom. “Didn’t you realize 
that addicted soldiers like my 
troops would stop at nothing 
once our secret was out? Death 
means nothing to us, compared 
to being cut off from our toad- 
stooloid supply. You are doomed 
once I give the word for the 
battle harps to sound the at- 
tack.” 

“Not at all,” said Tom. 
“Sound them, and find out.” 
The colonel stared at him. 
“Sir!” he said. “You wish me 
to sound the battle harps for the 
attack upon you?” 

“T-Tom . .” began Lucy, 
timidly. “After all — ” 

“Quiet, Lucy!” said Tom. “I 
know what I’m doing. Go ahead !” 
he snapped at the colonel. 
“Sound the harps. I defy you!” 
“Defy me?” In a sudden ty- 
pical, towering Skikana rage, the 
colonel spun about and shouted 
down the hill to Captain Jabat. 
“Sound the Harps! Prepare to 
advance!” 

Up on the slope they all saw 
the captain salute and turn. His 
voice floated faintly back to 
them as he shouted down to the 
battle harpsmen of the Skikana. 



88 



GALAXY 



“Sound the Prepare to Ad- 
vance!” they heard him call. 
“Shortly We Shall Eat You. 
Now!” 

The battle harps broke sud- 
denly into their air-rending, 
ground-shaking melody. The col- 
onel spun back and shouted thin- 
ly above their unbelievable har- 
monies. 

“You’ve asked for it!” he cried. 
“No quarter! No prisoners and 
no — 

His voice caught in his throat. 
The ground had suddenly heav- 
ed up alongside him and the cap 
of a toadstooloid six feet across 
poked itself above ground. Ab- 
ruptly it split apart into two 
enormous lips and the aperture 
between them inhaled with a 
gust that almost sucked them all 
off their feet. 

“What’s going on up here?” 
boomed forth a voice from the 
lips in accentless Wockii, and 
with such volume that it over- 
rode even the harp music. Down- 
slope the amazed and aghast 
harpsmen fell into jangling dis- 
cordancies and thence into si- 
lence. In the quiet that followed 
a smaller toadstooloid poked it- 
self above ground, grew upwards 
suddenly to about ten feet in 
height of stalk, and bent its cap 
toward the colonel. The surface 
of the cap drew back to reveal 
half a dozen large eyes. “Who’re 
you?” 



tt^olonel, commanding . 

^ 8th Skikana . .” mum- 
bled the colonel, obviously badly 
shaken but trying valiantly to 
pull himself up in military fash- 
ion. The toadstooloid with the 
eyes swiveled toward Tom and 
Lucy, twisted toward the Hug- 
wos, turned toward the Flals and 
at last looked down toward the 
distant ranks of the Wockii and 
the Skikana. 

“I am the Prar’Rhu — or Pro- 
to-Rhu of the Rhu root system 
here on Mal’Rahr, as you strang- 
ers would doubtless put it,” an- 
nounced the toadstooloid lips 
boomingly. “Children, children! 
Can’t I take even a little nine 
thousand year nap without your 
getting into trouble? What is it 
this time?” 

One of the Flals stepped for- 
ward and began to whistle rap- 
idly, gesturing at the Wockii and 
the colonel. The eyed toadstool- 
oid, which had been watching the 
Flal, swiveled again toward the 
distant Wockii. 

“For shame!” boomed the 
enormous lips. The Wockii all 
immediately prostrated them- 
selves. Tom stepped forward to 
the toadstooloid with the eyes. 

“Excuse me,” he said, “but 
might I inquire of you what the 
relation happens to be — of mass 
to energy?” 

“Not at all. A simple ques- 
tion!” boomed the toadstooloid. 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



89 



"As anyone who has devoted 
even a few millenia of thought to 
the question must realize at 
once, e=mc^. Or, energy equals 
mass times the constant, squared 
— in the present and immediate 
universe only, of course. I as- 
sume you were asking about the 
relation as it exists merely in the 
present and immediate imi- 
verse?” 

“I was,” said Tom. 

“Excellent,” boomed the Prar’- 
Rhu. “Because the relationship 
becomes somewhat more compli- 
cated when we consider an in- 
finite series of parallel universes 
in an enfolded hyperspace. Are 
you planning to make use of the 
relationship in immediate, practi- 
cal nuclear terms, may I ask? 
Because, if so, I should perhaps 
warn you of certain explosive 
results . .” 

“No,” said Tom. “I asked the 
question only as a preliminary 
to introducing you to myself and 
to a whole galaxy of different, 
intelligent and educated races 
capable of conversing with you 
on a civilized level.” 

A whole . .” the lips broke 
off, trembling slightly with 
emotion. “You say, intelligent, 
educated races capable of con- 
versing . .” The Prar’Rhu was 
clearly unable to continue. Its 
half-dozen eyes on the taller 
toadstooloid blinked rapidly. 



“I mean just that,” said Tom, 
sympathetically. “Your hundreds 
of thousands of years of lone- 
liness are over. No longer will 
you need to take ten-thousand- 
year naps to escape unbearable 
and sanity-threatening boredom. 
No more will you be forced to 
exist only in the society of your 
intellectual inferiors. At last you 
will be able to communicate with 
minds the equal in capacity and 
accumulated wisdom with your 
own — ” 

“Never!” screamed the Ski- 
kana colonel, frothing at the 
jaws. He turned around and 
roared down the slope at Jabat. 
“Never mind the Prepare to 
Advance! Never mind the Ad- 
vance! Sound the Charge! Now!” 

Jabat wheeled about to repeat 
the order. 

“You shall not!” thundered 
the toadstooloid lips. And barely 
had the thunder of that voice 
died away on the surrounding 
slopes and hills when hundreds 
of thousands of little purple puff- 
balls began to sprout around 
the feet of the Skikana soldiery 
and an enticing, spicy fragrance 
filled the air. 

With wild cries, the Skikana 
soldiers threw aside their harps 
and weapons and fell upon the 
purple puffballs, cramming them 
into their jaws and passing 
quickly into a foolishly grinning 
stupor. 



90 



GALAXY 



“No!” cried the colonel, stag- 
gering, torn between his military 
pride and the odor of the puff- 
balls that had sprouted at his 
feet. “Get up . Charge! Get 
up, I say!” He was almost weep- 
ing. “Get up and fi . .” The 
scent of the puffballs overcame 
him. He collapsed on the ground 
and tore into those within arm’s 
reach like a starving man. 

VI 

(tT)ut what’s going to happen 
to the Skikana soldiers 
now?” asked Lucy, as they stroll- 
ed from the edge of the concrete 
landing pad out toward their 
spaceship, some six hours later. 
The Skikana soldiery, including 
the officers and the colonel, had 
escorted them back to the fort, 
marching as if hynotized by the 
orders of the Prar’Rhu. “They’re 
addicted to the toadstooloid, 
now, and — ” 

“No more,” said Tom. “When 
I was in the fort just now, I 
found that the fort kitchens had, 
of course, whipped up a large 
meal of toadstooloid, as was cus- 
tomary for the returning troops. 
However, to a soldier, the Ski- 
kana turned their heads away 
weakly and couldn’t stand the 
sight of the food. They ate im- 
ported Skikana battle rations in- 
stead.” 

“The Prar’Rhu put something 



in the little purple puffballs to 
cure them?” asked Lucy. She 
peered ahead. In the brilliant 
sunlight the shadow at the base 
of the spaceship was almost too 
dark to see into, but she thought 
she saw several Skikana figures 
waiting by the airlock ramp. 

“Yes. The colonel realized 
that,” said Tom. “That’s why he 
asked to see me before we left. 
He offered to make a clean 
breast of the facts here for In- 
terstellar publication, if I would 
help explain to Interstellar Court 
that the original addiction wasn’t 
the fault of the Skikana — which 
it wasn’t. Actually, it was an 
accident having to do with the 
Skikana capacity for food — 
what’s the matter?” 

“Tom!” Lucy clutched at his 
arm. “Isn’t that Captain Jabat 
and a couple of other Skikana 
officers waiting for us at the 
ship?” 

“What? Oh, yes,” said Tom. 
“I was expecting him.” He called 
ahead in Skikana. “Good after- 
noon, Captain!” 

“Good afternoon, sir Ambas- 
sador!” replied Jabat, stiffly as 
Tom and Lucy came up into the 
shadow at the foot of the ship. 
“I believe that before you leave 
we have some little matter to 
discuss.” 

Lucy’s heart sank. Abruptly, 
she remembered the competition 
model Skikana handgun which 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES 



91 



had been brought to Tom in the 
fort, earlier. 

“Ah, yes,” Tom was saying 
easily. “Do you have it with 
you?” 

“Right here, sir!” said Jabat. 
Another Skikana officer stepped 
forward with the dish containing 
the handgun. The handgun’s 
twin, Lucy saw, was clipped to 
Jabat’s harness, waiting. 

“Tom!” she cried urgently in 
English. “Don’t touch it!” 



CC^ertainly, my dear,” said 
Tom in Skikana, as if she 
had merely been encouraging 
him. “It will be a pleasure to 
encounter the prospect of being 
handgunned and devoured by 
such an eminent opponent as 
Captain Jabat.” In English he 
added hastily. “Stop worrying, 
Lucy! He must be an excellent 
shot, or he wouldn’t have won 
that medal!” 

Tom took the handgun as 
Lucy gave vent to a stifled 
shriek. 

“Don’t!” wailed Lucy in En- 
glish. “Do you think I want you 
killed and d-devoured? Even by 
an excellent shot? Tom, come 
back!” 

Tom was already moving off 
with Jabat and the other Ski- 
kana to place themselves for the 
duel. “Tom, don’t you go get 
yourself handgunned! You said 
yourself he was bound to be fast- 



er on the draw than you are! 
What’s the matter? Have you 
gone crazy?” 

“Not at all,” called Tom, who 
had now taken up his position, 
facing Jabat, and was waiting 
for the signal to fire. “It doesn’t 
matter if he can outdraw me if 
he misses me, does it? Stay there. 
I’ll be right back.” 

“But you said he was an ex- 
cellent shot — ” the words froze 
on Lucy’s lips as the presiding 
officer gave the command to 
fire. Jabat’s reflexes were too 
fast for Lucy’s eye to follow. One 
moment he was standing there. 
The next, his handgun was in his 
grasp and a pale lance of fire 
was driving toward Tom. 

It passed some inches above 
Tom’s head. Lucy stared. Tom 
had not even drawn his own 
handgun. 

“Tom! Shoot!” cried Lucy. 

“Certainly not!” he called back 
in English, annoyedly. “Please, 
Lucy, be quiet. You’re disrupting 
the order of the occasion with 
all this talk.” 

Jabat had not stirred. With 
the typical unshakable pride and 
courage of a Skikana, he was 
standing waiting. 

“Sir!” he called to Tom, “I 
believe you have a return shot 
coming.” 

"That is quite correct, Captain,” 
Lucy heard Tom reply through 
her whirling confusion. “How- 



92 



GALAXY 



ever, I do not believe I will take 
it at this moment.” 

It was a physiological impos- 
sibility for a Skikana to turn 
pale. However, it seemed to 
Lucy that Captain Jabat faded. 

“No, sir?” he answered. “May 
I ask when you do intend to?” 
“I’m not sure,” replied Tom, 
idly. “Possibly tomorrow. Pos- 
sibly a year from now. Possibly 
not even in our respective life- 
times. In fact, the more I think 
of it, the more I think I’ll prob- 
ably never be able to get around 
to it.” 

(( 4h. I see,” said Jabat. He 
raised his handgun and 
saluted Tom. The other officers 
did likewise. “It has been an 
honor to know you, sir Ambas- 
sador and Assassin.” 

“Well, that’s finished,” said 
Tom, coming back to Lucy. 
“Let’s get aboard so that the 
ship can take off.” He patted a 
pocket attached to his weapons 
harness as he led the way up 
the ramp, Lucy following word- 
lessly at his side. “Ah, there 
you are, sir,” he said to the 
ship’s first officer, waiting at the 
airlock. “My compliments to the 
Captain, and will he take off as 
soon as possible ” 

“You men can go to your own 
quarters,” he informed the .Hug- 
wos, standing at attention in the 
suite. “The Consort Lucy and I 



will be settling down for the re- 
turn trip.” He watched them file 
out and shut the door behind 
them. “Loyal fellows,” he re- 
marked to Lucy. “But it’s sim- 
ply not good policy to let anyone 
see where I secrete this agree- 
ment. 

“You realize how well we’ve 
come out of all this?” he asked, 
turning back to Lucy. “Instead 
of an exclusive agreemervt to 
deal with the Wockii in the fu- 
ture, we’re relieved of our obli- 
gations to the Wockii, since they 
weren’t the dominant intelligence 
on Mul’Rahr after all. And 
we’ve got an exclusive contract 
for immediate dealings with the 
true dominant intelligence, the 
Prar’Rhu — who is a biochemical 
synthesis! with a skill beyond 
imagination. Our human eco- 
nomic future is assured in the 
galaxy — ” he broke off. 

“Lucy, what’s wrong?” 

“You!” exploded Lucy. Tom 
took a hasty step backward. 

“You!” cried Lucy, following 
him up, and looking as if she 
was going to kick him. “What 
do you mean, getting into a duel, 
when I called and called and 
pleaded with you not to do it? 
What do you mean trying to get 
yourself killed? What if Jabat 
hadn’t missed?” 

“But he had to!” protested 
Tom, retreating. “You don’t un- 
derstand. The Skikana are proud 



A WOBBLE IN WOCKII FUTURES

of their honor being without 
stain. ' — Never merciful in vic- 
tory, never resentful in defeat 
. remember what Jabat said? 
The chance to challenge had 
been offered. I couldn’t leave the 
planet without duelling him. But 
good Skikana manners forbade 
that he should try to kill me 
after I had defeated them, here 
on Mul’Rahr. It might have 
looked like sour grapes. He had 
very deliberately to avoid trying 
to kill me in the duel. That’s why 
I refused to shoot back. It would 
have been murder.” 

Tom stopped backing up, feel- 
ing he had scored a point. 

“To say nothing of the fact,” 
he added a trifle smugly, “that 
I have now stymied all future 
challenges to duel. Since no one 
can fight me until my present 
duel with Jabat is completed.” 
“But that’s even worse!” she 
burst out, enraged. “You knew 
there was no danger, and you 
let me stand out there and wor- 
ry. -And you told the colonel I 
wasn’t trustworthy, and I know 
you don’t trust me! Oh, I could 
kill you myself! I could — ” 
“Wait!” yelped Tom, as she 
started to advance on him again. 
“Wait! I tell you I do trust 
you — ” 

“You don’t.” 

“Didn’t you read what I wrote 
on your credentials just before 
the Skikana attacked?” cried 



Tom. “How could I trust you 
any more than that. I left it all 
up to you if anything should 
happen to me.” 

“What do you mean. I — ” 
Lucy ripped open her belt-purse 
snatched out her credential pap- 
ers and unfolded them. “If 
you’ve done something else — ” 
Her voice failed. She was star- 
ing at Tom’s handwriting. 

“To all Assassin Guild Offi- 
cials . she read aloud, “the 
individual presenting this is not 
a wilf, but my consort, on whom 
falls the duty of completing a 
mission in which I have just 
been slain. I charge all Guild of- 
ficials and members with the 
duty of assisting her to complete 
that mission in my name, stat- 
ing that I have the utmost trust 
and faith in her capabilities to 
do so. Thomas Parent, Appren- 
tice and Guild Member . .” 
“You see,” said Tom. “All the 
time I did trust — ” 

Lucy flung herself upon him. 
Prepared rather for war than 
affection, Tom lost his balance 
and went over backwards onto 
the rug. Lucy fell on top of him. 

It’s very undignified,” he 
managed to mutter, a few mo- 
ments later, “for an ambassador, 
to say nothing of an Assassin to 
be on his back on the floor — ” 
“Oh, shut up!” said Lucy, 
kissing him.

he doorbell sounded. 

Hal Page had been attend- 
ing to two final tasks: first, 
checking around the apartment 
and making sure everything was 
ready for this, which was going 
to be one hell of a party; sec- 
ond, trying to decide where to 
put the notice. He would have 
liked to destroy it, but when he 
came to the mouth of the dis- 
posal! and opened it — letting the 
faintest, faintest whiff of the 
stink from the far-away incinera- 
tors mingle with the heady per- 
fumes loading the air in the 
room — he found he had chang- 
ed his mind. He needed the solid 
feel of it in his hand, the crinkly 
rustle of it in his ears, to drive 
him to the completion of his 
ultimate purpose. 

At a party like this, no hiding 
place was likely to remain se- 
cret, especially in view of his 
reckless reputation; the guests 
would make it a point of honor 
to seek out and, if possible, ruin 



his most costly possessions, to 
make him break new records 
when he cleared up the mess and 
replaced the spoiled items. But 
he dared not have anyone even 
guess at the motive for throwing 
such a party on this randomly 
chosen day. If anyone realized 
word would spread like the ru- 
mor of plague, and he would 
spend tonight alone, staring at 
nothing, and feeling the cold 
hand of terror on his heart. 

“Oh, God damn!” he said 
aloud, snatching the notice into 
a place of concealment in the 
front of his loose silk shirt. Auto- 
matically he consulted his watch, 
though he knew the bell had 
sounded twenty minutes at least 
ahead of party time. It was the 
most expensive watch in the 
world; it had cost him four full 
years, and sat on the back of his 
left index-finger measuring the 
decay rate of a tiny grain of 
radium. 

The bell sounded a second 




95 



time. He reached his decision. 
What the hell point was there 
in keeping the notice? Every 
word of it was ingrained in his 
mind, and could be summed into 
the single terrible warning: to- 
morrow! 

But if he had no intention of 
being here, of being alive to- 
morrow, why hesitate to have 
the paper destroyed? 

He thrust the document into 
the disposall as he had originally 
intended. The gesture brought 
him a sense of calm, of boats 
being burnt. He went smoothly 
and coolly to open the door. 

“You’re early, but come in 
anyway — no reason to delay 
the . 

TJT e got that far before he rea- 
lized that the man facing 
him - - a little older than himself, 
say thirty-five, slim, saturnine, 
bright eyed — was wearing the 
black of an adult. And then, with 
a twisting grimace of disgust, he 
made to close the door, wishing 
it were possible to slam it with 
a crash. 

“Wait,” the man in black said 
softly. “Remember me, Hal?” 

Page hesitated. He made a val- 
iant effort to see the face above 
the drab black garb as that of 
an individual instead of merely 
as the mask of an adult, and 
relays of memory closed. He 
said, “Why — at a party of . 



What was the girl’s name?” 

“Karen Sottine — but that 
doesn’t matter. Mine does. I’m 
Thomas Dobson.” The man in 
black paused, his eyes sharp as 
scalpels. “Are you going to make 
me stand here where anyone 
passing down the corridor might 
see me? Are you going to have 
them start to wonder why an 
adult comes calling on Hal Page, 
the professional youth? You see, 
I know about the notice you’ve 
had, and the reason for this spec- 
tacular party tonight.” 

“You’re not going to be here?” 
Page forced out violently. “I 
said ‘open house’, but hell’s name 
I didn’t mean — ” 

“No, of course not.” Dobson 
managed to put into the short 
disclaimer an infinite quantity 
of contempt, and Page wanted 
to writhe but lacked the time 
before the other continued. “Your 
guests won’t be less than half 
an hour late — you know that 
as well as I do. Even for a 
glimpse of the legendary Hal 
Page, who gambled and got 
away with it, who’s dragging so 
many others after him by his 
example.” 

Page recovered his self-pos- 
session and made a mocking half 
bow. “So you’ve come for a sight 
of me, have you? To see what 
you’ve missed? Well, come in 
then. Have what you want, at 
my expensel”

He waved Dobson past him 
with a grandiose gesture, indicat- 
ing the array of delicacies with 
which the room was stocked; 
antiques and objets d’art had 
been thrust aside hastily to make 
room for them. “Champagne — 
genuine champagne from France? 
Caviar? Lark’s tongues? Take 
your pick, it’s all charged to 
me.” 

“Thank you,” Dobson said, and 
selected a sliver of hard toast 
with which to dip into a bowl 
of red caviar. “You know,” he 
added musingly when he had 
swallowed the first mouthful, 
“it’s a shame you’re not equip- 
ped to value this for v.’hat it is — 
that you should see it only as a 
gigantic prop for your ego.” 

<f\J^ou’re not equipped to en- 
joy anything,” Page snap- 
ped. “God, even the first time 
I met you — what? Five years 
ago! — you weren’t equipped to 
get fun out of life! You sat there 
like a brooding ghost and poured 
out second-hand philosophical 
claptrap that nobody wanted to 
listen to — ” 

“You listened.” Dobson dipped 
a second portion of the caviar 
and the toast crunched noisily 
between his teeth. 

“Only because I didn’t believe 
you could be real,” Page grunt- 
ed. “There you sat — there was 
this girl alongside you, the one 



with pretty red hair and a mouth 
that — well, skip that. But I got 
her afterwards.” 

“I know. She told me.” Dob- 
son swallowed the last of his 
toast and dropped into a soft 
chair. A fugitive smile crossed 
his face. 

“You mean she looked at you 
twice?” A vague stab of non- 
comprehension troubled Page 
momentarily. 

“We got married,” Dobson 
said. “A course of action which 
probably wouldn’t interest you 
very much.” 

“Damned right,” Page said 
shortly. “She had a hell of a 
body, but her mind was all clut- 
tered with the same kind of 
nonsense you were spouting that 
evening . And yet, you know, 
I guess I should be grateful to 
you in a way. Up to that time 
I’d run with the herd; I’d taken 
for granted all the pious nothings 
which I’d had spooned into my 
ears in school. I looked at you, 
and I thought hell, if they’re 
going to take me and grind me 
into the same mould as you, I’m 
going to get my kicks first. And 
— why yes! It was right on the 
following day that I went out 
and got myself something which 
cost a whole year for the first 
time. And I felt great. And I 
went right on from there.” 

“Tell me something.” Dobson 
cocked his saturnine head and

regarded Page with apparently 
sincere interest. “Didn’t you feel 
anything when you ran your 
debt up over a century?” 

“Sure!” Page gave a harsh 
laugh. “I felt I was getting out 
from under.” 

“Nothing else?” 

“I know what you mean. 
You’re trying to say: wasn’t I 
scared that they’d come along 
and cut the ground from under 
my feet? Hell, no. You take 
yourselves too seriously, you 
adults. A minimum of thirty 
years free, that’s what they tell 
you. Granted, I had a bad mo- 
ment the day I woke up and 
found I was a week past thirty 
— I’d sort of lost count during 
a weekend party. But it kept on, 
and kept on, and here I am. 
Thirty-two years, one month 
and four days.” 

“Stop,” said Dobson quietly, 
and reached for another dip of 
red caviar. 

Page reddened. He said, “So 
what’s going to be done about it? 
My debt’s up to three hundred 
years now, and there isn’t a 
damned thing you can do! It’s 
spent — or it will be by dawn 
tomorrow!” 

“And what do you have to 
show for it?” 

4 4T have to show what anyone 
A will tell you. I have proof 
of more guts than you. I have 



proof I wasn’t scared of the con- 
sequences. I didn’t turn around 
and make myself into an adult 
ahead of due date, so that when 
they called for me I’d go fawn- 
ing and saying, ‘Look, here I’m 
already acting like one of you — 
please be kind to me!” 

A sudden thought broke his 
train of words like a derailment. 
He shot out an accusing finger. 
“Hey! How do you know about 
the — the . .?” 

The question trailed off into 
silence colored with more than 
a little alarm. 

“No, I haven’t come to get 
you, if that’s what you’re think- 
ing,” Dobson said equably. I am 
in fact required to call on you 
and make sure you understand 
the responsibilities which go with 
all of the privileges you’ve en- 
joyed.” 

“Sure, I understand them 
fine,” Page said, and motioned 
towards the door. “Now suppose 
you get on your way, and leave 
me to have my last fling.” 

“Sorry.” The voice sounded 
genuinely regretful, but Page 
alertly sought a trace of sarcasm 
in the dark-browed face. “I have 
to do the job, and if I don’t get 
to complete it before your guests 
arrive I just have to try and do 
it later. So the choice is fairly 
simple: sit and listen now, or sit 
and listen later because there

you ctmpany — the word will 
have got around. And you know 
how superstitious everyone in 
your group is about someone 
who’s been given notice. As 
though diey suddenly carried the 
taint of a deadly disease.” 

He’d been comparing it men- 
tally to plague, earlier: that gibe 
got throu^ Page’s annoyance. 
He dropped into a chair facing 
Dobson and sighed. 

“I’d rather take you and push 
your smug face down the dis- 
posal!, but — oh, spit it out and 
make it diort!” 

Dobson folded his hands calm- 
ly on his lap. He said, “I doubt 
if you’ve caught up on classics 
of literature during this expen- 
sive whirlwind of a life, but may- 
be if you’d done so you’d have 
developed a greater insight into 
your situation, particularly if 
you’d read a couple of works by 
the dramatist Shaw. Eariy and 
mid-twentieth century. Mean 
anything to you?” 

“Point Come to the point I’ve 
had my notice — you know that 
— and I don’t want to be bated 
tonight of all nights 1” 

4CX^e-es, you have rather a 
* marked capacity for bore- 
dom, don’t you? Seems some- 
how unfair . Well, to be pre- 
cise what I had in mind was a 
beautiful capsule summary of 
the contemporary economic set- 



up v^ch is pcob^bly apocryphal, 
but who cem be sure? Reputed^, 
Shaw said in his old age that 
youth was wonderful; what a 
pity it had to be wasted on the 
3 TOung! For in his view — as ex- 
pounded at some length in Back 
to Methuselah — only the vns- 
dom which age entrains can fit 
an individual to make optimum 
use of the energies of youth.” 

Dobson’s eyes went once 
around the room, seeming to 
take in, sum up and dismiss 
everything for which Page had 
staked three centuries of exis- 
tence. Page shivered and ordered 
him violently to hurry up with 
his little chat. 

The other briskened. “All 
right. Well, even enclosed as you 
are in your psychologically in- 
cestuous circle of good-time 
chums, it must have been borne 
in on you that there has been 
progress since the old days? That 
we have colonized two other 
planets in this . system, that we 
are reaching out to explore the 
planets of other stars?” 

“I caught something about it 
on three-vee,” Page said in a 
heavily ironical tone. 

“Yes. Moreover, we enjoy a 
universally high standard of liv- 
ing, in which we apply as the 
only truly dependable economic 
yardstick the investment of in- 
dividual effort.” 

“I’ve spent three centuries

worth,” Page grunted. “Have 
you any news that isn’t stale?” 

“Patience!” Dobson raised a 
slender hand. “I’m required to 
do this, as I told you. Even if 
your interruptions compel me to 
spend all night at it.” 

“I heard! I just don’t see the 
point of the lecture on current 
affairs. Are you softening me up 
to tell me that I’m to be sent out 
to Mars or somewhere, to sweat 
on one of those damned construc- 
tion projecte?” 

“You caught that on three-vee 
too, presumably,” Dobson sug- 
gested with acid politeness. “No, 
you are not to be sent to Mars. 
The work there is almost at the 
point where human effort can 
be supplanted by machinery, and 
only skilled options are likely to 
remain open there in future. Do 
I get the chance to make my 
point, or do you so much like 
the sound of your own voice 
you’d rather hear only it be- 
tween now and tomorrow morn- 
ing?” 

Page made a disgusted gesture 
and leaned back in the chair. 

"Thank you. In your last year 
of school, when you should by 
rights have been old enough to 
make a fairly enlightened deci- 
sion, you were instructed in the 
forms of modem society. You 
were told, for instance, of the 
expenditure against credit which 
would be made available to you 



at least until age thirty, and that 
the credit was charged like all 
expenditure nowadays against a 
standard base-scale of individual 
work. Only the time counts; 
there’s no question, for instance, 
of someone who’s not capable of 
highly skilled work being made 
to return more years of unskilled 
labour to balance the accounts. 
We’re very rich as a race, we 
human beings — we don’t have 
to be petty in such things,” he 
paused 

CC'\7'ou were told the reason- 
ing behind this system. 
You were told — and like most 
adolescents, you certainly didn’t 
believe — that an endless round 
of pleasure and self-indulgence 
ultimately would grow boring, 
and that by the time you got 
your notice, to repay to society 
the credit you had drawn, you’d 
wish to make some more con- 
structive use of your life. You 
were told also that there was 
nothing fixed or inevitable about 
this repayment; there’s a certain 
inalienable minimum available 
to everyone, so that by living 
frugally a person may continue 
to be his own absolute master as 
long as he wishes — this course 
is usually chosen by those with 
a strong rebellious and creative 
bent, who would rather sit on 
the edge of a desert and paint 
sunsets than take up an adult’s 



100 



GALAXY 



post in the world. I don’t wish 
to criticize such people, by the 
way; in my view, that marks 
them out as among the most 
mature and self-reliant specimens 
of the race.” 

Unused to sitting and listen- 
ing, Page had begun to fidget. 
Now he burst out again, angrily 
this time. “I was certainly told 
all this, but I wasn’t convinced, 
and I still am not convinced. 
I’m getting a hell of a lot of 
kicks out of life, and the idea 
of being arbitrarily grabbed by 
the neck and — ” 

“Not arbitrarily,” Dobson cut 
in, with the first hint of strong 
feeling Page had yet seen from 
him. “You were told; you didn’t 
listen.” 

“Told what? That — how did 
you put it? That ‘an endless 
round of self-indulgence’ would 
end up by boring me? Hell, the 
only times I’ve been really bor- 
ed have been 'like now, when 
some stuffy-brained adult start- 
ed preaching at me!” 

He jumped up and went to 
fetch himself a shot of brandy. 

“The fact remains,” he went 
on over his shoulder, “I’m not 
fooled as easily as most people. 
You know they go around almost 
in awe of me? Like I’d done 
something special! All I did was 
see through this guff about what 
my debt to society consists of! 
I told you frankly, I had some 



bad moments when I realized I’d 
hit age thirty with a debt already 
topping two centuries. Then I 
caught on. If you jumped on mei 
right then and there, the first 
possible moment, the very day I 
got past the promised limit, you’d 
mark yourselves for scared. Peo- 
ple would have said, ‘It’s a 
fraud! They jumped on Hal 
Page because he took what he 
wanted from life and didn’t give 
a damn about the time he’d used 
up. Hell, if we’re all going the 
same way, let’s take what we 
can while we can!’ Isn’t that the 
size of it?” He rounded on Dob- 
son with a challenging glare. 

ttX^ou’re visualizing the whole 
of your generation spend- 
ing their credit by the century, 
the same as you,” Dobson mur- 
mured. “Do you seriously think 
that would matter? I said we’re 
a rich race. You have no concep- 
tion how rich we are! If every 
single one of the guests you’ve 
ever had to all your wild parties 
— if every guest at every party 
you’ve ever been to — if every- 
one of your entire generation de- 
cided to spend as freely and 
lavishly as you, all it would take 
to absorb this would be to re- 
price their expenditure down to 
the productive effort we can rea- 
sonably accomodate during their 
later lives. We’re embarrassingly 
rich, Hal! These days, we sel- 



WASTED ON THE YOUNG

dom even have to send a notice 
to people. With the thirtieth 
birthday come and gone, people 
tend to get restless — they lose 
interest in their round of pleas- 
ure — they turn up one day and 
ask to be assigned for some real 
work. I did that myself.” 

“But I’m not like you,” Page 
rasped. Somehow the contempt 
he had intended to load into his 
voice rang false on utterance. 

“The point I’m making still 
stands,” Dobson countered equa- 
bly. “Our difficulty is in utiliz- 
ing the resources which make 
themselves available to us. Nine 
people out of ten who reach the 
age of thirty nowadays have al- 
ready lost heart for mere pass- 
ing amusements. They’ve taken 
a course of study, or set them- 
selves a small research project, 
or made plans for a family — 
done something adult, in short. 
And we have to cope with thic 
tremendous flow of creative 
energy, channel it, make the 
most of it . That’s why we’re 
going out to the stars. It’ll be 
a hell of a long time before we 
actually reduce starflight to a 
routine operation, like a trip to 
the moon, but we’re going to 
need that escape route simply 
for the sake of not wasting the 
potential modern human society 
boils off like — like surplus heat 
from an engine!” 

“Finished?” Page growled. He 



drained his glass of brandy and 
poured another shot. 

“Not quite. We can’t let things 
slide; this is what I’m trying to 
put across to you. We can’t raise 
the age of full credit to thirty- 
five, for example, simply to re- 
duce the pressure on us to ab- 
sorb the would-be adults.” 

“I’d have no objection!” Page 
blurted, thinking of the terrible 
warning notice he had thrust 
into the disposall: your full free 
credit period terminates tomor- 
row . 

“But already people are find- 
ing it hard to last out thirty 
years fooling around.” Dobson 
raised one eyebrow. “Did you 
not just hear me say so?” 

“I’ve heard it all! I’m sick of 
it all! There’s nothing more you 
can tell me — how about using 
the door?” Page tossed down the 
second brandy as though he hat- 
ed it. 

“Yes,” Dobson sighed, and 
made to rise. “It’s all been said 
to you, over and over. You just 
don’t seem able to draw the con- 
clusions . ‘None so deaf as 
those who will not — ’ Ah, never 
mind.” 

Page watched him move to- 
wards the door. The hostility 
died in his eyes as the final ques- 
tion burned upwards toward full 
consciousness. Without intending, 
he found himself starting to voice 
it.

And there it faltered, partly 
because he was ashamed to ad- 
mit to this black-garbed intruder 
that the prospect made him 
afraid, partly because he was 
afraid. 

The saturnine man paused and 
looked back. “Do I know what 
they’ll make you do? As a mat- 
ter of fact, yes. But I’m not em- 
powered to tell you.” 

“Make me? I thought there

of his normal bluster back into 
the words. 

“You poor fool,” Dobson said. 
“How many choices do you im-

hundred years’ worth of credit?” 

And he was gone. 

T) ut it was a great party. There 
were just two bad moments 
' — the first, when meditechs had 
to be called after a fight devel- 
oped between two men over some 
chit of a girl Page had had last 
year and didn’t think worth the 
trouble; the second, when he 
found himself screaming at the 
crowd to drink more, eat more, 
dance more frantically, and rea- 
lized that their eyes were on him, 
their faces halfway frightened at 
the dreadful intensity of his 
manner. He checked himself de- 



liberately and covered his mo- 
ment of sdf-betrayal by seizing 
the nearest ^1 around the waist 
to smother her face in kisses. He 
must not — dared not — let it be 
suspected that he was imder sen- 
tence of death. Tonight, up to 
the very last minute, he must be 
with people, he must have the 
noise and laughter and the crash 
and smash of priceless articles, 
a soft hot sweat-pearled body 
under his, a silk pillow for his 
head ringing with Dobson’s calm, 
terrifying voice echoing in mem- 
ory. 

With the third girl, around 
three in the morning, he failed 
to make it, and knew that the 
time was come. 

Abruptly he pushed her aside 
and got off the bed. He went into 
the bathroom and shut the door 
behind him. Luckily there was 
no one in here just now, though 
earlier three or four people had 
been showering down together 
and writing obscene verse on the 
tiled walls with a bar of lavender- 
colored soap. He steadied himself 
with one hand and gazed at his 
reflection in the floor-to-ceiling 
mirror. 

“Last time,” he whispered. 
“But they’ll remember me.” 

The one who cheated them. 
The only ambition he had ever 
conceived. 

It wasn’t unique to himself. 
But others whom he’d heard of. 



WASTED ON THE YOUNG

who tried the same, who fouad 
the prospect of being snatched 
away from this ceaseless selfish 
delight intolerable, had botched 
the job. There were whispers; 
there were shuddering rumours 
in answer to casual questions. 
"Where’s so-and-so lately? 
Haven’t seen him around.” Oh, 
he got his notice. “And — ?” Tried 
to get out from under. Cut his 
throat. “And — ?” They healed 
him. 

“I guess Dobson would accept 
that,” Page told his reflection, 
seeing the grim lines form around 
his soft mouth. “I guess he’d 
say they were warned and had 
to take the consequences. But 
being told in advance doesn’t 
justify it. I don’t give a damn 
for paying back what I’ve had 
in credit. No one asked me when 
they set up this filthy system, 
and I opt out!” 

His voice had peaked to a 
loudness that scared him; he 
didn’t want to be overheard. 
When he went, he wanted the 
party to continue. Maybe it 
would go on till the news came 
back: Hal Page made it! Hal 
Page got out from under! 

One final twinge of irresolu- 
tion overcame him; then he re- 
called the expression on Dobson’s 
face as he went out, and thought 
about the implications of his 
parting promise. 

No: better the silent dark of 



death. And he — he wasn’t going 
to botch the job. 

''T^he aircar had cost him one 
and a half years’ credit. It 
was going to be well worth it, he 
thought dreamily as he gulped 
down the five capsules of hyp- 
notic — three hours’ credit — and 
set the controls to carry him out 
to sea. There was just about 
enough fuel for fifty miles; by 
then, he’d be at thirty thousand 
feet. And hitting water from such 
a height ought to be pretty much 
like smashing into a stone wall. 
If they even got back enough to 
use for prosthetics they’d be 
lucky, but that was the most 
they could hope to have back 
from . Hal Page’s famous 
record-breaking debt ... of more 
than . three hundred . 

Blackness. And horror. 

Light in darkness. Awareness. 
A shocking, horrifying lack of 
bodily presence. Vision, inde- 
structible without lids to lower 
over the traitor eyes. He tried to 
scream, and found he had no 
voice; he tried to rise and run, 
and found he had no legs. 

He was in a large, light room, 
pale walled, without a window, 
and facing him on a steel chair 
was the grim black form of Dob- 
son, somehow elongated from 
front to back, as though he was 
deeper than he should be. 

A voice said, “On now,” and a 



104

whitish presence moved at the 
edge of vision, crazily out of 
proportion: a woman in a sterile 
coverall. 

“I think you have the lenses 
too far apart,” Dobson said. 
“He’s probably getting exagger- 
ated-stereo vision.” 

Something monstrous loomed 
in Page’s field of vision, and the 
perspectives of the environment 
shrank to something nearer nor- 
mal. 

“I’m sorry for you, Hal,” Dob- 
son said softly. “And by the way, 
don’t try to talk. We haven’t cut 
in the vocal circuits yet.” 

The consciousness of Hal Page 
withdrew, turned into something 
smaller than a mouse, began to 
run frantically around and 
around in the confines of his 
brain . which, he knew and 
could not face knowing, was all 
that was left to him. 

“You may go insane,” Dobson 
said, his voice reduced to a thin 
whispering. “But I guess in some 
senses you’ve always been in- 
sane. Borderline psychopathic, in- 
capable of drawing a rational 
conclusion from what you were 
told, incapable of empathizing to 
the point of taking someone else’s 
word. I guess we have to be 
grateful that people like you 
still turn up occasionally — it’s 
our greatest strength as a race 
that we can build on our own 
weaknesses . .” he paused. 



tt^'T^here was almost nothing 
left of you, Hal, but you 
should have known from what 
I told you when I called at your 
apartment that you were a rarity, 
too rare to waste. We’re com- 
pelled to be strictly honest; there 
are unpleasant tasks to under- 
take, and we never hide the fact. 
You elected yourself for one of 
them, in full possession of all the 
information which would have 
enabled you to back out if you’d 
cared to. But you didn’t. You 
went right ahead. You spent 
credits founded on other people’s 
efforts until the free choices open 
to you as repayment dwindled 
to a single possibility. 

“So here I am with the task 
of telling you, after you made 
the mistake of thinking you could 
welsh on your debt.” Dobson 
sighed heavily. 

“We have to go to the stars, 
Hal. Creeping outward. As I told 
you, it’s forced on us because we 
have so much energy to absorb, 
so much frantic creativity, so 
much skill and impatience. One 
day we’ll go at the speed of light, 
freely and easily, but before that 
epoch arrives there must be 
scouts, explorers, pathfinders . 
You, Hal. You’re going to Rigel, 
as the commander, and the crew, 
of a slow, slow rocketship, and 
the round trip is going to last 
just about three hundred years.”

THE 

DECISION MAKERS 

by JOSEPH GREEN 



illustrated by GAUGHAN 



His iob was to make decisions for 
his people And these terrifying 
Earth creatures did it fhemselvesl 



1 

'l^he Decision Maker swam lei- 
surely just beneath the sur- 
face, listening to the vast pulse- 
beat that was the life of his 
people. It had been some time 
since he had eaten last and his 



eyes, obedient to that primal 
command, were alert for prey; 
but hunting did not interfere with 
the more mental functions which 
occupied the group part of his 
mind. 

He angled to the surface for 
air, glancing briefly at the hu- 

106 



man’s Gathering-Place while his 
head was above water. The round 
gray buildings squatted like over- 
large toadstools on the rocky 
shore a hundred body-lengths 
away, dimly seen through the 
snow that a driving wind had 
brought down off the mountains. 

As he dipped beneath the sur- 
face he caught a glimpse of 
something dark and sleek to his 
left and turned that way. The 
fi.sh saw him and tried, too late, 
to flee. He bit off its head while 
still in motion, swallowed it, then 
seized the body in his webbed 
fingers and disposed of it in two 
bites. 

The fish-which-flys comes, De- 
cision Maker, came a strong pro- 
jection from the south. It was a 
composite voice made by many 
individuals, and accompanying it 
was a clear image of a small 
winged ship. 

He swam to the surface and 
turned his eyes to the southern 
sky. The ship itself was too small 
to be visible, but he located it by 
the brightness of its flaring retro- 
rockets. 

Then the fires winked out as it 
sank below the horizon. 

He called for strength from all 
people in his immediate area, 
received it, and projected. He 
found the ship immediately, now 
moving swiftly toward him. And 
yes, the human’s Decision Maker 
was inside. 



tif’ve put us in a polar orbit, 
Conscience Odegaard,” said 
the shuttle pilot to his only pas- 
senger. “Ground Control says the 
blow-storm should clear up by 
the time we make a round. I’ll 
de-polarize the floor viewplate 
and let you look Sister over di- 
rect while we wait.” 

He touched a control and the 
floor between their seats grew 
milky, then transparent. The 
harsh, xanthic light of Capella 
G flooded in. Below them, 
stretching endlessly to the hori- 
zons, was mile after mile of deep 
blue water. 

The pilot made a few final 
adjustments on the attitude gy- 
ros, then relaxed and said, “At- 
lantis is on the other side, and 
we’ll pass over the station in a 
minute.” 

Allan Odegaard stared with 
weary disinterest at the watery 
landscape. They were moving 
toward the planet’s northern 
pole, and the edge of the North 
polar continent soon came in 
sight. He saw a narrow ledge of 
ice hugging a low and rocky 
shore. 

“The station’s under those,” 
said the pilot, pointing. Allan 
gazed where the finger indicat- 
ed, but saw only the white- 
tinged clouds of the blowstorm. 
As they moved inland the clouds 
fell behind, and he saw great 
mountains rearing craggy heads 



THE DECISION MAKERS

in an immense annular forma- 
tion, the dominant feature of the 
continent. A thin sheet of ice 
covered most of the lower land 
between the peaks, sparkling and 
glittering in the sunlight. Like a 
rather flat diamond in a Tiffany 
setting, Allan thought. Then 
they were over the sea once 
more. 

“There’s the first peaks of 
Atlantis,” said the pilot, point- 
ing again, and Allan saw three 
small islands floating like green 
jewels on the blue water, the 
last two curving sharply av/ay 
to the left. Then the view was 
monotonous until they reached 
the southern polar continent, 
where the mountains seemed 
taller and the icecap even thin- 
ner. 

Allan sat back and relaxed, 
knowing he had seen the plan- 
et’s entire land area, Sister, or 
Capella G Eight as it was more 
properly known, was visually less 
interesting than most, and now- 
adays even the best bored him. 
He had been too long away from 
home. After this assignment he 
was going to insist on returning 
to Earth, if only for a vacation. 
A Practical Philosopher could 
not afford to lose contact with 
the people he represented. 

The pilot was good, the touch- 
down scarcely jarring the little 
shuttle. A big, smiling man in 
cold weather clothes met Allan at 



the ship’s base and helped him 
loosen his helmet. The fresh air 
was so cold he almost strangled 
on his first breath. 

“I’m Station Manager Zip 
Murdock, Conscience Odegaard,” 
said the big man in a hearty 
voice. “And this is Phyllis Roen, 
our biologist.” 

The tiny woman by the big 
man’s side said, “I’m afraid I’m 
responsible for getting you here. 
Conscience Odegaard. Zip and 
the others don’t feel a question 
even exists.” 

T urdock glanced up at the 
cargo hatch, where the pilot 
was already rigging the small 
crane. “They don’t need us for 
the unloading. Let’s get inside 
and get you settled, and then 
Phyllis can bring you up to date 
on our problem — if we have 
one.” 

The sun had moved behind a 
high cirque in the west, and 
deep shadows were creeping 
across the field. Allan started 
with them toward the foamfab 
buildings, which huddled at the 
base of a rocky ridge two-hun- 
dred yards inland. From the 
ridge to the sea the ground had 
been cleared of loose rock, the 
debris forming two long piles 
of heaped boulders. Half of the 
cleared area nearest the beach 
was used for a landing field. 

They had taken only a few 



108

steps wb/Ti there was a loud yell 
erf warning behind them. Allan 
turned, to see that the scene 
had suddenly and dramatically 
changed. From behind the rock 
walls near the water, and from 
the sea itself, fist-sized rocks 
were appearing and flying to- 
ward the Earthmen. The unload- 
ing crew was scrambling for shel- 
ter, yelling wildly and drawing 
their laser guns. 

“It’s the seals!” said Phyllis, 
and there was fear in her voice. 
Murdock had already drawn a 
laser pistol, its dark red jewel 
glinting in the fading light. 
There were no attackers in sight, 
just the rocks appearing from 
nowhere and arcing toward them. 
After a moment Murdock, in ap- 
parent frustration, fired toward 
a cluster of rocks near at hand. 
The hit boulder sparkled brief- 
ly, absorbing the heat but not 
all the light. Other beams began 
to flash as the unloading crew 
got into action. The little land- 
ing area became a weird tangle 
of multicolored lights, shifting 
shadows and coruscating rocks. 
The net effect was to provide a 
flickering but adequate illumina- 
tion. 

Allan saw his first seal clearly 
as it left the shelter of the rocks 
and ran for the water, dragging 
a wounded comrade. They were 
tiny creatures, only half his 
height, and they moved with an 



odd, stiff-jointed swing from one 
leg to the other that looked awk- 
ward but was marvelously fast. 
Murdock saw them also and lift- 
ed his gun, but the beam hissed 
through the air where they had 
been as they dove together into 
the sea. And abruptly the crea- 
tures were gone. It was quiet 
again and the darkness was 
creeping swiftly over the narrow 
beach. 

“The little devils are getting 
bolder,” said Murdock, bolstering 
his gun. “That’s the first day- 
light attack on dry land.” 

Allan stooped and picked up 
one of the stones which had just 
been flung at them. It was ap- 
parently obsidian, and had been 
hand-chipped until it had several 
sharp edges, each capable of 
penetrating a spacesuit. Primitive 
— but deadly. 

"How did they propel them 
so far?” he asked Phyllis, but 
before riie could answer an ex- 
cited voice called, “Miss Roen! 
Miss Roen, I’ve found a dead 
one in the rocks! Do smu want 
the body?” 

Allan saw the small woman 
visibly hesitate before she called 
back, “Yes, please. Take it into 
the lab.” 

“I’d better stay here a mo- 
ment and assess the damage,” 
said Murdock, moving toward a 
man who was lying on the 
ground holding a bloody arm.

“If you’ll go with Phyllis, Con- 
science Odegaard ...” 

A s they approached the build- 
ings Allan saw two sentries 
standing on rocky eminences, 
where they could observe the 
entire area. Large floodlights 
brightly illuminated the ground 
around the buildings. Evidently 
these civilians had learned to 
take some rather military pre- 
cautions on Capella G Eight. 

There was no airlock, but the 
station personnel had built an 
anteroom where both spacesuits 
and cold w/eatlie^ gear were hung. 
Allan shed his suit with thanks- 
giving, and turned to find Phyl- 
lis Roen already out of her 
heavy clothes and waiting for 
him. 

The tiny woman was obviously 
Eurasian, with very black hair 
streaked with gray and features 
which were delicate without be- 
ing pretty. He estimated her age 
at around thirty-five. She still 
looked very good to him, and this 
was another indication that he 
had been too long away from 
Earth. 

“Do you like what you see. 
Conscience Odegaard ?’’ Phyllis 
asked, and though she was 
smiling there was an edge in her 
voice. He realized he had been 
staring. 

“I’m sorry,” he said quickly. 
“And please, call me Allan.” He 



paused, not wanting to explain 
that ‘Conscience’ was a popular 
term rather than an actual title, 
and he had grown very tired of 
hearing it. A doctorate in philo- 
sophy was the highest academic 
achievement on his record, but 
to qualify as a Practical Philo- 
sopher master’s degrees were re- 
quired in political science, alien 
psychology, sociology and biol- 
ogy. The public, when it learned 
of the unique responsibilities of 
the Practical Philosophers, had 
sv/iftly christened them the 
‘Consciences of Mankind’, and 
the name had stuck. 

Mankind needed a conscience, 
these days. His swiftly expanding 
exploration and colonization of 
the galaxy was bringing him into 
contact with dozens of complete- 
ly new lifeforms, and seemingly 
limitless variations of those al- 
ready familiar. Time and again 
the question had arisen of wheth- 
er alien creatures on habitable 
worlds were animals or intelligent 
beings, and some wrong decisions 
had been made before the P.P. 
corp was established. The ex- 
haustive academic routine deter- 
red all but the most hardy, and 
there were less than a dozen 
‘Consciences’ to date, but they 
had brought the pro'olem some- 
what under control. At least ro- 
mantic Space Service captains 
were no longer declaring a plan- 
et unfit for colonization because

its overlarge ants had unusually 
well-developed instinctual pat- 
terns. 

This time her smile was more 
sincere. “All right, Allan, and 
the same. Now if you’ll come 
with me I’ll take you on the 
penny tour, and after dinner 
we’ll have a look at the dead 
seal.” 

II 

''Y^he Decision Maker’s body 
■*- had relaxed into the state of 
lazy somnolence which was the 
nearest his kind approached 
sleep, but his group mind was 
still active. As he moved auto- 
matically toward the dark sur- 
face for air he turned the matter 
of his opposite among the hu- 
mans, and finally concluded that 
there were too many unknowns 
at present. He was unable to 
perform his function. 

He could, and did, reach one 
conclusion, and communicated it 
to those individuals whose added 
consciousness within his mind en- 
abled him to be a Decision Mak- 
er. It was that the people would 
make no further attacks at pre- 
sent. The next move would be 
left to the humans. 

At dinner Allan met about 
half the station’s complement of 
forty scientists, and discovered 
there was a general air of cheer- 
ful optimism prevalent. On some 



tiny stations on bitterly hostile 
worlds he had seen isolation and 
confinement sour personal rela- 
tions until the whole crew was 
ready tc commit murder. He was 
surprised, as Phyllis kept rattling 
off names and professions, to 
find meteorologists, geologists 
and glacialists dominating the 
group. Usually it was chemists, 
biologists, and the new ‘Environ- 
mental Adjustors’. 

Zip Murdock did not appear 
for dinner. Apparently he and 
the unloading crew were still 
busy outside. 

The departing thunder of the 
shuttle’s rockets penetrated the 
aerated walls as Phyllis led Al- 
lan into the lab. The seal was 
lying on a table in the cold room, 
an area ventilated to outside at- 
mosphere. Phyllis produced light 
but warm clothing for them and 
they went inside. 

Allan looked down at the prone 
form on the table, the sleek skin 
marred by a deep-burned hole in 
the neck. It was the head that 
gave the first strong impression 
of seal. The face had a black, 
square-cut nose, long whiskers, 
a rounded ridge of forehead ris- 
ing abruptly above the muzzle; 
but the body ruined the illusion. 
The lower abdomen split into 
two short legs, each ending in a 
large flat pad. The upper mem- 
bers, though equally short, had 
a jointed section, and the ends 



112 



GALAXY 



terminated in long ridged fingers 
of cartilage, with a thin mem- 
brane between. 

Allan ran trained fingers over 
the musculature of a leg. The 
large muscles on the front and 
back were equal in size, a won- 
derful arrangement for swimming 
but somewhat awkward for walk- 
ing. Yet he had seen two of them 
actually running when they re- 
treated after that brief attack on 
the landing field. 

He asked Phyllis how they did 
it. She grinned, an impish grim- 
ace on her small face. “They 
fool you, Allan. A bit more 
adaptable than they look 
Watch.” 

She lifted one pad clear of the 
table, held the leg with her other 
hand and slowly forced the pad 
to move. It revolved until it was 
perpendicular to the body, and 
he saw that it was set in a very 
flexible bone socket. She drop- 
ped the leg, rolled the creature 
on its side and twisted the other 
pad in the opposite direction. It 
also moved to the perpendicular. 

“One pad before, one behind. 
A very stable arrangement,” said 
Phyllis. “It gets around with 
relative ease on land, even 
though it looks awkward to us, 
and you saw how they threw 
stones with those arms.” 

“Not with the arms. Look what 
they found with this fellow.” 
Allan stepped to another bench, 



picked up a long flat strip of 
hide she had not noticed, and 
folded the ends together. A wide 
section in the center formed a 
pouch. 

“A sling! Of all weapons.” 
There was a touch of awe in 
Phyllis’ voice. “Well, this should 
convince Zip, if he still needs 
convincing!” 

“That the seals are intelligent? 
I doubt it. Animals have used 
tools before.” 

“Yes, but — they didn’t have 
these earlier, you see. They live 
an almost entirely aquatic exist- 
ence, and the only artifacts we’ve 
seen have been sharpened basalt 
spiears. This is a dry land wea- 
pon. They just invented it, to 
use in fighting us.” 

“That’s interesting, but still 
no proof. This continent you’re 
trying to raise has been dry land 
several times, I understand. 
Quite possibly these creatures 
have used the sling in the past 
and retained an instinct of how 
to build it.” 

“A far more sensible explana- 
tion than intelligence,” said a 
new voice. 

\ llan turned to see Murdock 
entering the cold room from 
outside. The big man stamped 
some clinging snow off his feet 
and walked to the table. “H-m- 
m-m, a nice fat one. Let’s have 
him for dinner tomorrow, Cissy.” 



THE DECISION MAKERS 



113 



“Zip! Please, I have a hard 
enough time living with the 
memory that we did eat a few!” 

“And they were a little fishy 
tasting, but not bad,” said Mur- 
dock cheerfully. “Beats the con- 
centrates every time. Look, I’ve 
got to change and go eat. Don’t 
let this dizzy female fill your 
head full of nonsense. Conscience 
Odegaard.” 

“I do not form premature con- 
clusions,” said Allan carefully. 
Murdock, and most of the scien- 
tists here, were university em- 
ployees, the result of a steadily 
increasing trend for large univer- 
sities to contract colonization 
evaluations. They had almost 
edged out the competing private 
companies, and the government 
had long ago settled for super- 
vision of the contracts. These 
people had a strong vested in- 
terest in seeing that his decision 
went against the seals. When in- 
telligence was established it was 
standard policy to abandon the 
planet to its native owners. 

“Fine. Cissy is unabashedly 
prejudiced on the question. I’ll 
see you later in the evening, 
then.” 

As the big man closed the door 
behind him Allan turned to the 
woman and asked, “Even in an 
unmilitary organization such as 
this, isn’t that manner of speak- 
ing to you a little familiar?” 

She gave him a cool glance. 



“Perhaps, but that’s because he 
feels familiar. We’ve entered into 
a trial marriage contract, and 
plan on full matrimony when we 
get back to Earth.” 

“Oh, I see. That’s odd, I 
wouldn’t have thought you com- 
patible types.” 

She shrugged. “Who sa3rs we 
are? Perhaps it’s just sex drive 
and propinquity on both sides. 
But in any case we’re living to- 
gether, and were perfectly happy 
until we started quarreling about 
the seals. I had to go over his 
head to get you in here, and he’s 
going to be a long time forgiv- 
ing me for that.” 

Allan found himself wishing 
heartily he had not ventured into 
such personal ground. It was 
presumptions of him, and her 
answer had brought back his own 
deep-seated loneliness, twisting 
the knife of bitterness again. 
Kay had quickly divorced him 
when he had annovmced he was 
going into space; there would be 
no ‘widow’s wait’ for her. She 
had married again before he 
finished his final studies and left 
Earth, and when he visited his 
children his little daughter was 
already calling another man 
father. 

The life of a regular spaceman 
was bad enough, but at least he 
returned to Earth an average of 
once every two years. Allan had 
not been home in eight. Planet

GALAXY 



after planet raised the unique 
problem which called for a P.P.’s 
special authority, and die swiftiy 
spreading network of exploration 
brought in new ones faster than 
decisions could be made. Unless 
he rebelled he might spend the 
rest of his days hopping from 
world to world, with never a life 
of his own. 

\ llan beat a hasty retreat. “I’d 
like to see your notes, if 
you’ve already performed a dis- 
section,” he said, turning toward 
the door. “Tomorrow I’ll run one 
on this chap myself.” 

“Of course,” said Phyllis, re- 
verting to business as easily as 
he. “I ran several, and I’ve never 
seen a body better adapted for 
both swimming and walking. 
But the brain is — very odd. 
You’ll have to see it for your- 
self.” 

She escorted him to his cubi- 
cle, then left with word that she 
would see him later in the 
lounge. He found his luggage 
stacked on the bunk, and an hour 
later, showered, depilated and 
dressed in clean clothes, he head- 
ed for the lounge. Most of the 
station’s off-duty personnel were 
there, including Murdock. 

“Come sit by me, Allan,” the 
big man called. “I’ll split my 
shaker with you.” 

Murdock was drinking maquel- 
la, a mildly intoxicating beverage 



from Centaurus Four that had 
no after effects. Allan accepted a 
glass and sat down. 

“What do you think of our op- 
eration so far?” asked Murdock 
pleasantly. 

“I hardly know enough about 
it to think at all. Can you give 
me a general run-down on your 
plans? I was amazed to find 
Phyllis the only biologist here, 
and this is the first time I’ve 
seen an evaluation team with a 
high percentage of glacialists.” 

“He can talk about it all 
night,” said Phyllis, who was sit- 
ting on Murdock’s other side. 
“But the basic fact is that Sister 
is so nearly Earth-type that 
chemists and biologists aren’t 
really needed. The only genuine 
problem is raising Atlantis, and 
the general opinion is that this 
can be accomplished by a slight 
change in the weather.” 

“Yes, all it requires is a new 
ke age,” said Murdock with a 
chuckle. “But to give you some 
background — the median tem- 
perature on Sister is somewhat 
higher than humans prefer, and 
the open land area almost non- 
existent Offhand it looks very 
unpromising. But this planet has 
a very fortunate peculiarity. All 
three major land masses, the two 
poles and Atlantis, have the 
same distinguishing feature, a 
great circle of volcanic moun- 
tains surrounding a lower inland

area. Atlantis is the largest and 
lowest of the three, and almost 
entirely under water. We pro- 
pose, not to raise the continent, 
but to lower the ocean level. 

“The means of accomplishing 
this is relatively simple. Sister, 
despite the high concentration 
of water vapor in the air, has a 
low precipitation rate. The at- 
mosphere is exceptionally clean 
due to the tiny exposed land 
surface and low volcanic activity, 
and there is very little dust to 
serve as sublimation nuclei for 
raindrops. Precip is almost en- 
tirely dependent on giant con- 
densation nuclei, and that too is 
small because the oceans have 
a low salinity rate and there is 
very little sodium chloride in the 
air. Briefly, we propose to stimu- 
late the precip rate by blowing 
up the smallest of the four 
moons, in such a fashion that 
most of the material turns to 
dust. We will slow it below or- 
bital speed with the explosions, 
and create a rain of dust into 
the upper atmosphere which will 
continue for many years. Precip 
will rise to several thousand per- 
cent of normal. Over both polar 
regions this will come down as 
snow, and the rapid accumula- 
tion in the two enclosed conti- 
nents will swell the existing ice- 
fields until a sizable percentage 
of the planet’s water is locked up 
in ice. The world ocean level 



will drop, we estimate slightly 
over three-hundred feet, and 
that will bring all the ring of 
mountains and about half the 
interior of Atlantis above the 
surface. In addition, the tem- 
perature will drop to bearable 
limits. And then you can send 
in the colonists.” 

“It sounds almost too simple, ’ 
said Allan wonderingly. 

Ct'"T^hat’s an explanation in 
very broad terms. There 
are a few relevant details to be 
worked out, such as the large 
sunmirrors we’ll have to post 
above each pole, to artificially 
stimulate the firm fields and turn 
snow to ice by continuous melt- 
ing and refreezing, the four mir- 
rors we plan to place above what 
will be the largest lakes on the 
continent, both to help dry them 
up and stimulate the precip rate, 
the river shaping that will have 
to be done when the dropping 
ocean level starts them flowing, 
and a few thousand smaller de- 
tails, some of which we can’t 
even imagine yet. This will be 
the first attempt to terraform an 
entire planet by weather control. 
But if plans work out, within a 
hundred years nine-tenths of 
Atlantis will be growing grass, 
and that’s a land area of almost 
eight million square miles. The 
farming activities of the colonists 
should keep the dust level high 



116 



GALAXY 



and make the new precip rate 
self-perpetuating.” 

“It’s a big undertaking, but 
everyone thinks it can be done,” 
said Phyllis earnestly. “When 
you compare that much surface 
to those tiny areas on some of 
the new planets, where every 
square foot of soil has to be 
treated and re-treated before it 
will take Earth plants, you can 
begin to see what a wonderful 
opportunity this is.” 

“Yes, we’ve taken at least 
two thousand cores out of the 
higher areas in Atlantis,” resum- 
ed Murdock. “They show it’s 
been raised and inundated three 
times within the past hundred 
thousand years, obviously a re- 
sult of volcanic activity causing 
a temporary increase in the dust 
level. Plant growth was exten- 
sive each time the water receded, 
and we have a fairly thick layer 
of humus-rich soil on which to 
plan an economy. The sea has 
both animal and plant life in 
great quantities, including many 
species, like the seals, which can 
live on either land or water. I 
think Sister, within two hundred 
years, can support a hundred- 
million people.” 

“Weather control is still not 
an exact science, even on Earth. 
Can you really be this sure of 
how your dust and mirrors will 
affect this planet?” 

“No, but we’re certain enough 



to recommend going ahead witti 
it once we’ve finished our cur- 
rent job of assessing the ice- 
carrying capacity of this pole. 
After all, there’s no intelligent 
life to be harmed if we blunder.” 

Phyllis glared angrily at Mur- 
dock, but did not answer the 
implied derision. Most of the 
people in the lounge had been 
drifting out as they talked, sup- 
pressing yawns. The tiny Eur- 
asian rose, said goodnight to Al- 
lan, and left also. 

“I’m prepared to offer you 
any assistance within my power, 
Allan,” said Murdock rising. 
“Just let me know what you 
need.” 

“Thanks. I’ll probably call on 
you. Phyllis and I are going to 
dissect that seal in the morning 
and see what we can learn.” 

They learned very little Phyl- 
lis had not already known. Allan 
pushed back from the table after 
four hours of intense work, and 
turned off the recorder into 
which he had been making a 
running commentary. The seal 
was basically a variation of its 
distant cousins on Earth. There 
was nothing of unusual interest 
about its bodily processes, with 
the exception of that baffling 
brain. The pan was small, the 
cranium narrow, the actual size 
less than a quarter that of a 
human. But it was like nothing 
he had ever seen.

117 



They washed up and went to 
lunch. Phyllis had been a com- 
petent but not brilliant helper, 
and the notes she had taKen on 
what little she had observed of 
the seal’s behavior were no help. 
Her belief that the creatures 
were intelligent was apparently 
based on woman’s intuition rath- 
er than accumulated dat^- 
“I think we’ve learned aS much 
as we can from a dead specjimen,” 
he said after the meal. “What we 
need is a live seal. How do we 
go about getting one?” 

“That’s a tough question- They 
carry away their wounded after 
an attack, and it’s almost impos- 
sible to Catch them in the water. 
Several of the men tried, when 
we were - — ” she made a rnoue of 
distaste “—eating them.’' 

“I’ll discuss it with Murdock 
tonight,” said Allan. 

T should be the one! th^ Deci- 
£ sion Maker projected into the 
night, his individuality f<?r once 
overriding the group conscious- 
ness and speaking cleatly- Mine 
is the risk, let mine be the body! 

. but the soft, insistent voices 
of the individuals comprising the 
race memory cried No! No! it 
may not be! No danger to the 
Decision Maker. No danger. No 
danger . and he yielded, let- 
ting the desire to offer himself 
for the trap the humanS were 
setting fade from his mind. With 



its passing came the need for 
decisions. 

The humans were establishing 
a work party near the edge of 
the water, the work to continue 
after dark in hopes of luring the 
seals into an attack. Men with 
stun-guns were hidden through- 
out the rocks, and three large 
lights had been concealed at high 
points overlooking the area. The 
seals movements must be plan- 
ned to insure that the humans 
captured only the one individual 
the group selected. Also, the at- 
tack must look real, must seem 
to involve a large party while 
actually exposing the smallest 
possible number to danger. 

The word ‘Tactics’ appeared 
in his mind, and almost imme- 
diately there was an answering 
pulse. One of the new memory 
carriers, containing only the hu- 
man knowledge . He scanned 
the word and its associated mean- 
ings, leaped to three other mem- 
orybank units checking out in- 
ferences and related data, and 
had his plan. One of the humans 
had been an ardent follower of 
a game played on Earth, one 
which involved deceptive move- 
ment of bodies, concerted dis- 
plays of an object called a ball 
to a specified section of the play- 
ing area . He formulated the 
necessary details, and swiftly 
communicated them to the se- 
lected units of the people.

GALAXY 



Ill 

A llan crouched low in the rocks 
and watched the water. The 
two larger moons were passing 
slowly through the clear sky and 
the beach was well-lighted. He 
turned away a second to rub his 
eyes, and when he looked again 
the beach was swarming with 
short figures. It was almost as 
if he had signalled them to attack 
by looking away. 

The seals came running up- 
right out of the water and scur- 
ried behind the two walls of 
rock, moving stiff-legged but 
swiftly across the open area. 
From his vantage point Allan 
could see the leaders starting to 
twirl their slings. He drew his 
laser pistol and sent a red beam 
flaring into the sky. 

Instantly the searchlights came 
on, brightly illuminating the 
areas behind the rocks where the 
seals were gathering. The work 
gang dropped their tools and 
drew stun-guns, and the men 
hidden in the rocks rose to their 
feet, searching for targets. 

The abortive attack stalled. 
The seals broke for the sea, flee- 
ing what was obviously a trap. 
Allan saw the hurrying line of 
sleek forms plunging into the 
water, and rubbed his eyes. He 
would have sworn there were 
many more of them than now 
seemed visible. 



“Got one!” came an exultant 
yell, and “Me too!” said an- 
other voice. But Allan’s atten- 
tion was abruptly distracted. A 
seal popped into view less than 
twenty feet away, twirling a sling 
and looking directly at him. 

He hastily drew his stun-gun, 
fired and missed, cursed himself 
for a bungling professor who be- 
longed in a classroom, fired 
again, and saw the small figure 
drop. The sharp- edged missile 
clattered to the rock at his feet. 

The floodlights abruptly went 
out. There were wild yells as the 
humans, their eyes slow to ad- 
just back to moonlight, found 
themselves blinded. Allan groped 
his way to the seal he had shot 
and crouched over the body. 
They should have gotten several 
prisoners, but remembering the 
creatures’ habit of carrying off 
their wounded he was taking no 
chances. 

After a moment someone 
found the outlet where the pow- 
er cable had been disconnected, 
and the lights came back on. 
The noises of fighting had died 
away in the darkness, and now 
Allan saw there were no attack- 
ers in sight. 

“Hey! My seal’s gone!” called 
the first man who had claimed a 
hit, as though he could hardly 
believe it. 

“Mine too!” said another voice, 
and other men began to climb

among the rocks, looking for 
seals they had been certain they 
saw fall. When the confusion sub- 
sided Allan discovered they had 
exactly one captive . His. 

nphe small creature in the cage 
• twitched its long whiskers, 
stirred, and after a moment 
raised its head. The eyelids 
moved, and Allan found himself 
staring into a slightly protuber- 
ant pair of golden eyes. The 
thick black lips opened as the 
seal gave an almost human yawn, 
showing the long incisors of a 
carnivore’s dentition. The mouth 
closed with an audible click of 
teeth, and it moved to the bars 
separating them. 

“At close range it even looks 
intelligent,” said Phyllis softly, 
and the captive turned the gold- 
en eyes on her. They were alone 
in the cold room. 

I am not intelligent as you 
humans use the term, said a 
clear, cold voice in both their 
minds, in perfect World English. 
As a separate entity I exist as 
an animal, directed primarily by 
inherited instincts. But I am a 
member of a mentally interlock- 
ed race, and the combined minds 
which merge in my brain possess 
the quality of intelligence. 

The two humans turned to- 
ward each other simultaneously, 
and each saw that the other had 
received the message. There was 



a brief silence while the stunning 
implications sank in, and then 
Phyllis opened her rosebud 
mouth in a yell of high glee. 
“I told him! Oh, the thick-head- 
ed oaf, I told him, I told him!” 
Her enthusiasm was contag- 
ious, but Allan forced himself 
to be calm. A sense of steadily 
mounting excitement was build- 
ing up and his breath was rag- 
ged — these unexpected discov- 
eries were one of the rewarding 
parts of his job — but this was 
no time to become emotional. 

There was an odd quality to 
the mental voice. It gave a strong 
impression of a group speaking 
in chorus, but with the voice of 
this individual dominating the 
rest. 

“How may I best communi- 
cate with you?” he asked aloud. 

As you are now doing. Your 
immediate thoughts are unclear 
when you do not vocalize. 

“Then first,” his mind shifted 
into high gear, many events of 
the past few hours clicking to- 
gether into a coherent pattern, 
“first I want to know why you 
only pretended to attack the 
work party and deliberately let 
us capture you.” 

Because we wish to establish 
face-to-face communication. It is 
our understanding that you will 
decide whether these humans 
now here will leave, or stay and 
be joined by many more. 



120 



GALAXY 



“That is my responsibility, 
yes. But why are you interested 
in my decision?” 

There was a brief silence. Allan 
felt Phyllis’ hand clinging tightly 
to his arm, and he stared into 
the unblinking golden eyes, wait- 
ing. The creature finally pro- 
jected, It would be best if you 
would accompany this unit to a 
Gathering-Place. I am only a 
messenger. The Decision Maker 
wishes to meet you face-to-face, 
in the presence of a complete 
memory. 

Allan turned to look at Phyllis. 
She was staring at him, wide- 
eyed. Her expression asked. 
Trap? 

He shook his head, turned 
back to the seal. It had closed 
its mouth, and the heavy lips hid 
the sharp teeth. For the first 
time he saw how the large eyes, 
the downward curve of the 
mouth, the jutting whiskers, gave 
the seal a tragic-comic look, like 
the sad clowns of an ancient 
circus. “I will go with you,” he 
said aloud. 

t4'\/'our safety while you are 
here is my responsibility!” 
said Murdock angrily. “I couldn’t 
possibly permit it!” 

“You have no way of prevent- 
ing me.” Allan made a strong 
effort and kept his voice down. 
Despite the man’s bluff friendli- 
ness he had not liked Murdock 

THE DECISION /AAKERS

from the first, and this unexpect- 
ed opposition was too ill-timed 
to be anything but deliberate 
obstructionism. “I have the au- 
thority to take command of this, 
or any other civilian-operated 
station, and I will summarily re- 
move you as manager if that 
becomes necessary.” 

Murdock jumped to his feet, 
stood towering over the smaller 
man. His face was a fiery red, 
his big hands clenched into fists. 
Allan found himself wondering 
if Murdock would actually be 
foolish enough to hit him. 

“Rerrioving me may not be 
as easy as you seem to think!” 
the big man bellowed. They were 
alone in his private offce, and the 
sound was almost deafening. 

“Don’t be childish. The station 
personnel are thoroughly famil- 
iar with the authority of a Prac- 
tical Philosopher. They aren’t 
going to risk a prison sentence 
by supporting you.” 

“You talk pretty rough for 
such a small man!” 

“Please. Will you simply sup- 
ply me with the needed equip- 
ment without further argument?” 
Murdock supplied it. An hour 
after daybreak Allan and the 
seal were swimming through the 
blue water, about twenty feet 
below the surface, heading north- 
west along the ice shelf. The 
station’s standard underwater 
gear was a spacesuit with a 



ducted propeller mounted on the 
back, with a simple variable 
speed control installed between 
the first two fingers of the right 
hand. At maximum he could 
move less than ten miles an 
hour, and keeping his head tilt- 
ed back for vision and his arms 
rigidly ahead for guidance was 
tiring. 

Surrounding them, but keep- 
ing at a respectful distance, were 
fighting seals, all carrying basalt 
spears. Phyllis had assured him 
she had seen a team of seals 
kill the largest fish in this fresh- 
water ocean with those sharpen- 
ed rocks. 

It was another long and weary 
hour before his escort projected. 
Move toward the ice and des- 
cend slightly. Slow your speed. 

He obeyed, and after a mo- 
ment he saw a dark shadow in 
the white wall of ice, a shadow 
that swiftly grew larger. He an- 
gled slowly toward it and it be- 
came a jagged tunnel. The seal 
moved ahead to guide him. 

After a few yards the roof 
began to recede and he angled 
upward; he rose until he broke 
the surface, to find himself in a 
scene of strange but compelling 
beauty. 

It was a large grotto in the 
ice, at the head of a glacier that 
had reached the shore and lost 
its momentum. It had calved in 
a peculiar way, leaving this great 



122 



GALAXY 



hollow opening, and the sides had 
grown together again at the top. 
The ceiling was thin, sunlight 
pouring in through several long 
cracks where the joint was not 
perfect. The yellow beams struck 
one ice wall and rebounded in 
glittering fantasms of color, 
springing from surface to surface 
in a deceptive brightness that 
concealed more than it revealed. 
The massive walls were rough 
and jagged, with many sharp 
protruding edges. It was a fairy 
palace of crystal and glass, of 
reflected light and softened sha- 
dow, and Allan Odegaard thought 
it the most beautiful spot he 
had ever seen. 

Lying on the little beach and 
watching him with unblinking 
attention were about thirty adult 
seals. As he waded out of the 
water Allan saw that they form- 
ed a semi-circle, and at its cen- 
ter was the one who could only 
be the Decision Maker. 

IV 

'"T~'he two Decision Makers fac- 
ed each other, the golden 
eyes of the seal meeting and 
matching the brown eyes of the 
small Earthman. Allan lowered 
his gaze to check his environ- 
mental indicator, then undid his 
helmet. The air had a slightly 
fishy smell, but was crisp and 
cold. 



We welcome you to this Ga- 
thering-Place, came a projection, 
strong and commanding, and 
again it was compounded of 
many minds, though the over- 
riding personality was that of 
the Decision Maker. We have 
brought you here to prove that 
within the meaning of your terms 
defining ‘race’ and ‘intelligenf 
we are an intelligent race. We 
want you to declare this planet 
unlawfully occupied by Earth- 
men, and order those present to 
leave and all others to stay away. 

“1 have no choice but to grant 
that as a race you are intelli- 
gent,” said Allan slowly. “But if 
this mental ability is achieved 
by grouping minds, and as in- 
dividuals you are something 
much less than the unified whole, 
then you are a unique lifeform 
and will require further study. 
But for now I would like to know 
why you want us to leave the 
planet.” 

We know what the other 
Earthmen, those who understand 
the ways of wind, water and ice, 
seek to do here. Three times from 
the year our racial memory came 
into being the ice has grown, the 
sea lowered, the area you call 
Atlantis become half land and 
half water, the land green with 
growing things. Three times with- 
in memory our people have mov- 
ed in great numbers onto the 
land, only to be driven back into 



IHE DECISION AAAKERS 



123 



the sea when the ice melted 
once more. We have confirmed, 
from knowledge found in the 
minds of Earthmen, what we al- 
ready felt to be true, that we as 
a race cannot progress until we 
have freed ourselves of the envi- 
ronment of the sea. In another 
eight thousand of our seasons the 
ice will begin to form, as it has 
before. We will move onto the 
land, as we have before. But this 
time we will apply what we have 
taken from the minds of your 
companions and stored in our 
memory; we shall master the 
physical sciences, develop the 
necessary technology, learn to 
control the weather as you do. 
There will be no more flooding 
of the land. 

Listening to the calm, relent- 
less way the words formed them- 
selves and beat slowly through 
the neural passages of his brain 
Allan accepted the fact these 
people could do exactly what 
they said. 

“You have taken all the knowl- 
edge of all the humans here and 
stored it in your ‘racial mem- 
ory’?” 

All except yourself. Yours we 
will have in a few more nights. 

“Since you can read my mind 
you know that I have a difficult 
decision to make. It would help 
me if I knew what your ‘racial 
memory’ is, and how it works.” 
I would also like to know your 



goals as a race once you are on 
the land, and how you plan to 
achieve them.” 

'T~'hose questions are easily an- 
swered. Our group memory 
is an accumulated mass of 
knowledge which is impressed 
on the memory area of young 
individuals at birth, at least 
three such young ones for each 
memory segment. We are a 
short-lived race, dying of natural 
causes after eight of our years. As 
each individual who carries a 
share of the memory feels death 
approaching he transfers his part 
to a newly born child, and thus 
the knowledge is transmitted 
from generation to generation, 
forever. 

As for our aims, they are simi- 
lar to your own. We have achiev- 
ed — there was a brief pause — 
economic plenty. We have none 
of the conflicts between indi- 
viduals or groups of individuals 
which characterize your society. 
But this is not enough. We seek 
to improve the life of the indivi- 
dual within the race, and this 
entails increasing the natural 
lifespan, eliminating enemies, 
perfecting a science of medicine 
— a concept new to us — and 
achieving the ability to enjoy 
pleasure, which we now know to 
be lacking in our lives. All this 
we can accomplish by means of 
the knowledge now stored in our 



124 



GALAXY 



memory, once the land is again 
ours. 

And the Earthman has cor- 
rupted another innocent race, 
thought Allan with wry bitter- 
ness. 

We can read your thoughts 
when you project that strongly. 
You define ‘corruption’ as in- 
creased knowledge of the choices 
open to an intelligent being, and 
an inclination to make those 
choices which lead toward great- 
er pleasure in life. Why do you 
consider this a retrogressive 
quality? 

“I’m afraid it would be too 
complicated to explain, and per- 
haps I don’t fully understand 
myself,” said Allan grimly. “For 
now it’s enough to know I must 
make a decision which will vi- 
tally affect your future, and I 
freely admit I’m going to find it 
hard to do.” 

Since you state we qualify as 
an intelligent race your path 
should be clear. If you are now 
ready another unit will guide 
you back to your base. When 
you have made your decision 
speak it aloud, and we will hear. 
Bear in mind that if you decide 
to stay we will harass and fight 
you in every manner within our 
power. 

Allan slowly replaced his hel- 
met and turned toward the wa- 
ter. He felt like a man who has 
eaten too large a meal and wants 



nothing more than to crawl into 
a corner and estivate while it 
digests. But his meal had been 
mental, and he might be a long 
time in torpor before he fully 
understood all that he had learn- 
ed. 

The trip back was uneventful, 
and by noon he found himself 
in Murdock’s office, with only 
Phyllis and the base manager 
present. He gave them a brief 
report, and watched the incred- 
ulous expression form on Mur- 
dock’s face. Phyllis, too, seemed 
a little stunned. 

“Do I understand you have 
definitely decided an individual 
seal is not intelligent?” asked 
Murdock when he regained his 
composure. 

“I’ve made no decision. This 
ability to group minds is new to 
us, and requires study.” 

“Because their group intelli- 
gence is a unique phenomena is 
no reason to consider the indi- 
viduals within the group as 
weak,” said Phyllis heatedly. 

“I’ll probably want to talk to 
you again later,” Murdock’s voice 
was carefully expressionless. “In 
the meantime why don’t you get 
a bite of lunch. Phyllis, can you 
stay a moment?” 

\ llan took the implied dis- 
missal at face value and 
rose. He was hungry, but when 
he sat down to eat the concen- 



FHE DECISION ACKERS 



125 



trates seemed curiously tasteless. 
He kept thinking of the refresh- 
ing coolness of the air in the 
grotto, of the beauty of the sun 
on the sparkling ice, the strange 
and ancient wisdom he had found 
in a group of seals. How odd, 
that as a race they had achiev- 
ed the goals that had dominated 
the thinking of Earth’s best phil- 
osophers for thousands of years, 
and then had formed the con- 
viction that the need of the in- 
dividual were as important as 
those of the race. There were 
still social planners on Earth 
who were unable to think of 
people in any terms except 
‘groups’ and ‘masses’. 

After lunch he put on cold 
weather gear and went outside. 
He walked the beaches all after- 
noon, hating his responsibility 
and the necessity for it. When 
he returned to the station at 
dusk his thinking had degener- 
ated to vagrant thoughts; loose 
fragments, impressions and par- 
tial memories swirled through 
his mind ... we have achieved 
economic plenty, but this is not 
enough . corruption is in- 
creased knowledge of the choices 
open to an intelligent being . 
we will harass and fight you in 
every manner within our power 
. The memory of blood oozing 
from the bitten body of a fish 
before the seal gulped it down 
without chewing, the sad- clown 



faces, the overwhelming incli- 
nation to think of them as lov- 
able pets . What would it be 
like, to share your tholights, emo- 
tions and desires with your fel- 
lows, to form a composite being 
greater than the sum of its parts? 
There was a clear, reasoning 
power in the Decision Maker, an 
intellect of great strength. 

When he stepped inside the 
door the p.a. was calling his 
name. He walked to Murdock’s 
office as requested. 

“Sit down, Allan.” The bluff 
heartiness, the easy, friendly at- 
titude had been discarded, as 
though the big man knew they 
no longer served a purpose. His 
voice was brisk and impersonal. 
“I’m going to give you some 
information about Sister you 
won’t find in the regular reports. 
All personnel who are aware of 
it have been sworn to strict 
secrecy. Not that that’s necessary 
in your case, of course.” 

“Thanks,” said Allan stiffly. 

“You are aware, I’m sjnre, that 
Earth’s supply of uranium is 
almost exhausted. In the excite- 
ment over this new ‘sunlight dif- 
fusion’ method of power genera- 
tion and propagation the public 
has tended to forget the thou- 
sands of other industrial and 
medical applications of atomic 
science. They think that virtually 
unlimited power, available any- 
where at anytime, will solve all 



126 



GALAXY 



problems. Actually, the need for 
uranium grows every day, and 
it has proven hard to find in 
commercial quantities. Sister is 
a very rich planet. The cores we 
have taken from Atlantis show 
extensive deposits of uranite and 
davidite, as well as some pitch- 
blende, carnotite and tobernite. 
The primary concentration of 
davidite is on a rather high pla- 
teau, one which wiU be above 
water in five years. I predict that 
within ten there will be a refin- 
ing plant there, shipping ore to 
Earth. I can’t over-emphasize 
how important this is.” 

“That’s interesting informa- 
tion, Zip, but I fail to see the 
direct connection. I’m sure you 
are aware economic considera- 
tions never play any part in a 
P.P.’s decision.” 

“Oh, come off it! That garbage 
about being the ‘conscience of 
Mankind’ won’t wash with me. 
When word of these deposits 
reaches certain ears on Earth 
they’ll have your credentials 
withdrawn in a minute if you 
give us trouble.” 

“Do you really think so?” 
asked Allan. His voice was soft, 
almost gentle. 

“I’m certain of it. Idealism has 
its uses, but it can’t stand in the 
way of a genuine need.” 

“Would this sudden disbelief 
in a P.P.’s authority be connect- 
ed in any way with the royalties 



your university wiU lose if I rule 
against you?” 

Murdock’s face flushed, and 
he rose to his feet. 

“Can’t you understand that 
I’m thinking of the good of all 
mankind?” 

Allan sighed tiredly. “Perhaps 
you are. And the needs of all 
mankind influence me, in a way 
you might not understand. But 
you’re a little late with your 
information. I’ve already made 
up my mind. And I’ll require 
that underwater gear again in 
the morning.” 

When he was standing in his 
own cubicle after dinner he spoke 
into the air; “You said that you 
could hear me. Acknowledge that 
you do.” 

There was a sudden electric 
sense of awareness, as though 
someone had picked up a tele- 
phone and stood holding it with- 
out speaking. He waited, and 
after a moment the calm multi- 
ple voice asked. What is your 
wish? 

“I would like to speak to the 
Decision Maker again, in person. 
Would you send someone at day- 
light to take me to the Gathering- 
Place?” 

There was another brief si- 
lence, and he could almost hear 
the ether stirring with the hur- 
ried conference. 

Then the voice said. It shall 
be done.

beautiful grotto seemed 
■*- unchanged, except that there 
were several more of the spear- 
carrying warriors present. They 
did not trust him, which indi- 
cated that their mind-reading 
abilities were limited. He had 
prepared no treachery. 

The Decision Maker regarded 
him sadly from the center of 
his race’s memory bank, the gold- 
en eyes unblinking. This time 
you have summoned us. 

Allan took a deep breath of 
the cold air and paced back and 
forth on the small beach as he 
spoke, not looking at the seals. 
“You said you had no concept 
until our arrival of the science 
of medicine. Do you understand 
the meaning of the term ‘gam- 
ble’? Because I am gambling 
with your future, and I can’t 
possibly know how it will turn 
out. Let me give you my rea- 
sons and then my decision, which 
I have already sent to Earth.” 
The guards nearest him moved 
closer, their spears perceptibly 
rising. He sensed the air of men- 
ace in the room, and wondered 
if he had made a mistake in 
coming here in person. It would 
be strange to die in this ice pal- 
ace, when he had many times 
felt himself to be in far greater 
danger and escaped alive. 

“If you are left alone it will 
be eight-thousand years before 
a seal again walks the land, but 



then it will be a safe and certain 
thing. If we occupy your planet 
and war comes, you will kill 
many Earthmen before you are 
finally hunted down and killed. 
But make no mistake about it, 
you will be exterminated. Man is 
a capable, ruthless, relentless foe, 
and if he sets out to destroy you 
he will succeed. Your cooked 
bodies will grace his table, and 
it will not matter that the brains 
he shatters contain a racial mem- 
ory that reaches farther into the 
past than his own. 

“I cannot endure the thought 
that another thousand genera- 
tions of your kind should follow 
the tortuous road of the sea, 
gaining nothing but the day’s 
sustenance. Neither do I wish 
war between us. My decision has 
been to report that you are defi- 
nitely an intelligent race . but 
that I recommend completing the 
terraforming operation and start- 
ing colonization.” 

There was an instant stir 
among the seals, a silent shifting 
nearest him raised their spears 
and advanced, stood poised, 
ready to thrust him through. He 
glanced at the waiting warriors 
and back to the Decision Mak- 
er, and knew that his life hung 
on his next words. 

He had not known how they 
would react, and his meager 
knowledge of hive-minds did not 
justify guesses, but somehow he 



128 



GALAXY 



had not thought they’d take an 
immediate and personal revenge. 

“I am an Earthman,” he said 
slowly and clearly. “Sometimes 
I have been proud of my people, 
and sometimes ashamed. But the 
gamble I am taking is based on 
a knowledge of them, of other 
races, of your own, that you 
cannot match even with your 
long memory. If the colonists 
will follow my recommendation 
— cooperate with you, help you 
on land and be helped by you 
in the sea — there is no reason 
the two races cannot progress 
together. Despite our past his- 
tory I have enough faith in man 
to think he will fulfill his share 
of the bargain. Will you match 



my faith, and pledge your race 
to work with mine?” 

The Decision Maker faced him 
silently, and he felt a secret tug 
of knowing sympathy for an in- 
dividual who must decide the 
course of his entire race. The 
silence stretched out; the guards 
standing by him did not lower 
their spears. 

The Earthman stood waiting 
for the word that would decide 
his personal fate. The decision 
that the two races CQuld work 
together had been reached by 
reasoning, the one to tell the 
seals in person by a sudden im- 
pulse. 

Now he would learn the truth 
of both. — JOSEPH GREEN

SLOW 

TUESDAY 

NIGHT 






by R. A. LAFFERTY 



H was just an ordinary Tuesday 
night . rather slow, in facti 



A panhandler intercepted the 
young couple as they stroll- 
ed down the night street. 

“Preserve us this night,” he 
said as he touched his hat to 
them, “and could you good peo- 
ple advance me a thousand dol- 
lars to be about the recouping 
of my fortunes?” 

“I gave you a thousand last 
Friday,” said the young man. 

“Indeed you did,” the pan- 
handler replied, “and I paid you 
back tenfold by messenger be- 
fore midnight.” 

“That’s right, George, he did,” 
said the young woman. “Give 
it to him dear. I believe he’s a 
good sort.” 



So the young man gave the 
panhandler a thousand dollars; 
and the panhandler touched his 
hat to them in thanks, and went 
on to the recouping of his for- 
tunes. 

As he went into Money Mar- 
ket, the panhandler passed II- 
defonsa Impala the most beau- 
tiful woman in the city. 

“Will you marry me this night, 
Ildy?” he asked cheerfully. 

“Oh, I don’t believe so, Basil,” 
she said. “I marry you pretty 
often, but tonight I don’t seem 
to have any plans at all. You 
may make me a gift on your first 
or second, however. I always like 
that.” 



130 



But when they had parted she 
asked herself: “But whom will I 
marry tonight?” 

The panhandler was Basil Ba- 
gelbaker who would be the rich- 
est man in the world within an 
hour and a half. He would make 
and lose four fortunes within 
eight hours; and these not the 
little fortunes that ordinary men 
acquire, but titanic things. 

■\ T^hen the Abebaios block had 
’ ’ been removed from human 
minds, people began to make 
decisions faster, and often better. 
It had been the mental stutter. 
When it was imderstood what it 
was, and that it had no useful 
function, it was removed by sim- 
ple childhood metasurgery. 

Transportation and manufac- 
turing had then become practi- 
cally instantaneous. Things that 
had once taken months and years 
now took only minutes and 
hours. A person could have one 
or several pretty intricate careers 
within an eight hour period, 
Freddy Fixico had just in- 
vented a manus module. Freddy 
was a Nyctalopw, and the mo- 
dules were characteristic of these 
people. The people had then 
divided themselves — according 
to their natures and inclinations 
— into the Auroreans, the Hem- 
erobians, and the Nyctalops; or 
the Dawners who had their most 
active hours from 4 A.M. till 



Noon, the Day-Flies who otj- 
tained from Noon to 8 P.M., and 
the Night-Seers whose civiliza- 
tion thrived from 8 P.M. to 4 
A.M. The cultures, inventions, 
markets and activities of these 
three folk were a little different. 
As a Nyctalops, Freddy had just 
begun his working day at 8 P.M. 
on a slow Tuesday night. 

Freddy rented an office and 
had it furnished. This took one 
minute, negotiation, selection and 
installation being almost instan- 
taneous. Then he invented the 
manus module; that took anoth- 
er minute. He then had it manu- 
factured and marketed; in three 
minutes it was in the hands of 
key buyers. 

It caught on. It was an at- 
tractive module. The flow of 
orders began within thirty sec- 
onds. By ten minutes after eight 
every important person had one 
of the new manus modules, and 
the trend had been set. The mo- 
dule began to sell in the mil- 
lions. It was one of the most 
interesting fads of the night, or 
at least the early part of the 
night. 

Manus modules had no practi- 
cal function, no more than had 
Sameki verses. They were at- 
tractive, or a psychologically sat- 
isfying size and shape, and could 
be held in the hands, set on a 
table, or installed in a module 
niche of any wall. 



SLOW TUESDAY NIGHT 



131 



Naturally Freduy became very 
rich. Ildefonsa Impala the most 
beautiful woman in the city was 
always interested in newly rich 
men. She came to see Freddy 
about eight-thirty. People made 
up their minds fast, and Ildefon- 
sa had hers made up when she 
came. Freddy made his own up 
quickly and divorced Judy Fixi- 
co in Small Claims Court. Fred- 
dy and Ildefonsa went honey- 
mooning to Paraiso Dorado, a 
resort. 

I t was wonderful. All of Ildy’s 
marriages were. There was 
the wonderful floodlighted sce- 
nery. The recirculated water of 
the famous falls was tinted gold;' 
the immediate rocks had been 
done by Rambles; and the hills 
had been contoured by Spall. 
The beach was a perfect copy of 
that at Merevale, and the popu- 
lar drink that first part of the 
night was blue absinthe. 

But scenery — whether seen 
for the first time or revisited 
after an interval — is striking for 
the sudden intense view of it. It 
is not meant to be lingered over. 
Food, selected and prepared in- 
stantly, is eaten with swift en- 
joyment: and blue absinthe lasts 
no longer than its own novelty. 
Loving, for Ildefonsa and her 
paramours, was quick and con- 
suming: and repetition would 
have been pointless to her. Be- 



sides Ildefonsa and Freddy had 
taken only the one hour luxury 
honeymoon. 

Freddy wished to continue the 
relationship, but Ildefonsa glanc- 
ed at a trend indicator. The 
manus module would hold its 
popularity for only the first third 
of the night. Already it had been 
discarded by people who mat- 
tered. And Freddy Fixico was 
not one of the regular successes. 
He enjoyed a full career only 
about one night a week. 

They were back in the city 
and divorced in Small Claims 
Court by nine thirty-five. The 
stock of manus modules was re- 
maindered, and the last of it 
would be disposed to bargain 
hunters among the Dawners who 
will buy anything. 

“Whom shall I marry next?” 
Ildefonsa asked herself. “It looks 
like a slow night.” 

“Bagelbaker is buying,” ran 
the word through Money Mar- 
ket, but Bagelbaker was selling 
again before the word had made 
its rounds. Basil Bagelbaker en- 
joyed making money, and it was 
a pleasure to watch him work as 
he dominated the floor of the 
Market and assembled runners 
and a competent staff out of the 
corner of his mouth. Helpers 
stripped the panhandler rags off 
him and wrapped him in a ty- 
coon toga. He sent one runner 
to pay back twentyfold the 



132 



GALAXY 



young couple who had advanced 
him a thousand dollars. He sent 
another with a more substantial 
gift to Ildefonsa Impala, for 
Basil cherished their relationship. 
Basil acquired title to the Trend 
Indication Complex and had cer- 
tain falsifications .set into it. He 
caused to collapse certain in- 
dustrial empires that had grown 
up within the last two hours, and 
made a good thing of recombin- 
ing their wreckage. He had been 
the richest man in the world for 
some minutes now. He became 
so money-heavy that he could 
not maneuver with the agility he 
had shown an hour before. He 
became a great fat buck, and the 
pack of expert wolves circled him 
to bring him down. 

Very soon he would lose that 
first fortune of the evening. The 
secret of Basil Bagelbaker is 
that he enjoyed losing money 
spectacularly after he was full of 
it to the bursting point. 

A thoughtful man named Max- 
well Mouser had just pro- 
duced a work of actinic philo- 
sophy. It took him seven minutes 
to write it. To write works of 
philo.sophy one used the flexible 
outlines and the idea indexes; 
one set the activator for such a 
wordage in each sub-section; an 
adept would use the paradox 
feed-in, and the striking ana- 
logy blender; one calibrated the 



particular-slant and the person- 
ality-signature. It had to come 
out a good work, for excellence 
had become the automatic mini- 
mum for such productions. 

“I will scatter a few nuts on 
the frosting,” said Maxwell, and 
he pushed the lever for that 
This sifted handfuls of words like 
chthonic and heuristic and pro- 
zymeides through the thing so 
that nobody could doubt it wa* 
a work of philosophy. 

Maxwell Mouser sent the work 
out to publishers, and received it 
back each time in about three 
minutes. An analysis of it and 
reason for rejection was always 
given — mostly that the thing 
had been done before and bet- 
ter. Maxwell received it back ten 
times in thirty minutes, and was 
discouraged. Then there was a 
break. 

Ladion’s work had become a 
hit within the last ten minutes, 
and it was now recognized that 
Mouser’s monograph was both 
an answer and a supplement to 
it. It was accepted and published 
in less than a minute after this 
break. The reviews of the first 
five minutes were cautious ones; 
then real enthusiasm was shown. 
This was truly one of the great- 
est works of philosophy to ap- 
pear during the early and me- 
dium hours of the night. There 
were those who said it might be 
one of the enduring works and 



SLOW TUESDAY NIGHT 



133 



I^even have a hold-over appeal to 
the Dawners the next morning. 

Naturally Maxwell became 
very rich, and naturally Ilde- 
fonsa came to see him about 
midnight. Being a revolutionary 
philosopher, Maxwell thought 
that they might make some free 
arrangement, but Ildefonsa in- 
sisted it must be marriage. So 
Maxwell divorced Judy Mouser 
in Small Claims Court and went 
off with Ildefonsa. 

This Judy herself, though not 
•0 beautiful as Ildefonsa, was 
the fastest taker in the City. She 
CMily wanted the men of the 
moment for a moment, and she 
was always there before even 
Ildefonsa. Ildefonsa believed that 
rfie took the men away from 
Judy: Judy said that Ildy had 
her leavings and nothing else. 

“I had him first,” Judy would 
always mock as she raced 
through Small Claims Court. 

“Oh that damned Urchin!” Il- 
defonsa would moan. “She wears 
my very hair before I do.” 

Ayyaxwell Mouser and Ildefonsa 
Impala went honeymoon- 
ing to Musicbox Mountain, a re- 
sort. It was wonderful. The peaks 
were done with green snow by 
Dunbar and Fittle. (Back at 
Money Market Basil Bagelbaker 
was putting together his third 
and greatest fortune of the night 
which might surpass in magni- 



tude even his fourth fortune of 
the Thursday before.) The chal- 
ets were Switzier than the real 
Swiss and had live goats in every 
room. (And Stanley Skuldugger 
was emerging as the top Actor- 
Imago of the middle hours of the 
night.) The popular drink for 
tliat middle part of the night 
was Glotzenglubber, Eve Cheese 
and Rhine wine over pink ice. 
(And back in the city the lead- 
ing Nyctalops were taking their 
midnight break at the Toppers’ 
Club.) 

Of course it was wonderful, as 
were all of Ildefonsa’s — But she 
had never been really up on 
philosophy so she had scheduled 
only the special thirty-five min 
ute honeymoon. She looked at 
the trend indicator to be sure. 
She found that her current hus- 
band had been obsoleted, and 
his opus was now referred to 
sneeringly as Mouser’s Mouse. 
They went back to the city and 
were divorced in Small Claims 
Court. 

The membership of the Top- 
pers’ Club varied. Success was 
the requisite of membership. Ba- 
sil Bagelbaker might be accepted 
as a member, elevated to tlie 
presidency and expelled from it 
as a dirty pauper from three to 
six times a night. But only im- 
portant persons could belong to 
it, or those enjoying brief mo- 
ments of importance.

“I believe I will sleep during 
the Dawner period in the morn- 
ing,” Overcall said. “I may go 
up to this new place Kpjmopolis 
for an hour of it. They’re said to 
be good. Where will you sleep, 
Basil?” 

“Flop-house.” 

“I believe I will sleep an hour 
by the Midian Method,” said 
Burnbanner. “They have a fine 
new clinic. And perhaps I’ll sleep 
an hour by the Prasenka Pro- 
cess, and an hour by the Dor- 
midio.” 

“Crackle has been sleeping an 
hour every period by the natural 
method,” said Overcall. 

“I did that for a half hour not 
long since,” said Burnbanner. “I 
believe an hour is too long to 
give it. Have you tried the natur- 
al method, Basil?” 

“Always. Natural method and 
a bottle of red-eye.” 

Otanley Skuldugger had be- 
come the most meteoric ac- 
tor-imago for a week. Naturally 
he became very rich, and Ilde- 
fonsa Impala went to see him 
about 3 A.M. 

“I had him first!” rang the 
mocking voice of Judy Skuldug- 
ger as she skipped through her 
divorce in Small Claims Court. 
And Ildefonsa and Stanley-boy 
went off honeymooning. It is al- 
ways fun to finish up a period 
with an actor-imago who is the 



hottest property in the business. 
There is something so adolescent 
and boorish about them. 

Besides, there was the public- 
ity, and Ildefonsa liked that. The 
rumor-mills ground. Would it last 
ten minutes? Thirty? An hour? 
Would it be one of those rare 
Nyctalops marriages that lasted 
through the rest of the night and 
into the daylight off hours? 
Would it even last into the next 
night as some had been known 
to do? 

Actually it lasted nearly forty 
minutes, which was almost to the 
end of the period. 

It had been a slow Tuesday 
night. A few hundred new pro- 
ducts had run their course on the 
markets. There had been a score 
of dramatic hits, three minute 
and five minute capsule dramas, 
and several of the six minute 
long-play affairs. Night Street 
Nine — a solidly sordid offering 
— seemed to be in as the drama 
of the night unless there should 
be a late hit. 

Hundred-storied buildings had 
been erected, occupied, obsolet- 
ed, and demolished again to 
make room for more contempor- 
ary structures. Only the mediocre 
would use a building that had 
been left over from the Day- 
Flies or the Dawners, or even 
the Nyctalops of the night be- 
fore. The city was rebuilt pretty 
completely at least three times

during an eight-hour period. 

The Period drew near its end. 
Basil Bagelbaker, the richest 
man in the world, the reigning 
president of the Toppers’ Club, 
was enjoying himself with his 
cronies. His fourth fortune of 
the night was a paper pyramid 
that had risen to incredible 
heights; but Basil laughed to 
himself as he savored the mani- 
pulation it was founded on. 

''T^hree ushers of the Toppers’ 
Club came in with firm step. 
“Get out of here, you dirty 
bum!” they told Basil savagely. 
They tore the tycoon’s toga off 
him and then tossed him his 
seedy panhandler’s rags with a 
three-man sneer. 

“All gone?” Basil asked. “I 
gave it another five minutes.” 
“All gone,” said a messenger 
from Money Market. “Nine bil- 
lion gone in five minutes, and it 
really pulled some others down 
with it.” 

“Pitch the busted bum out!” 
howled Overcall and Burnbanner 
and the other cronies. “Wait, 
Basil,” said Overcall. “Turn in 
■ttie President’s Crosier before 
we kick you down stairs. After 
all, you’ll have it several times 
again tomorrow night.” 

The Period was over. The Nyc- 
talops drifted off to sleep clinics 
or leisure-hour hide-outs to pass 
their ebb time. The Auroreans, 



the Dawners, took over the vital 
stuff. 

Now you would see some ac- 
tion! Those Dawners really made 
fast decisions. You wouldn’t 
catch them wasting a full minute 
setting up a business. 

A sleepy panhandler met II- 
defonsa Impala on the way. 

“Preserve us this morning, 
Ildy,” he said, “and will you 
marry me the coming night?” 
“Likely I will, Basil,” she told 
him. “Did you marry Judy dur- 
ing the night past?” 

“I’m not sure. Could you 
let me have two dollars, Ildy?” 
“Out of the question. I believe 
a Judy Bagelbaker was named 
one of the ten best-dressed wom- 
en during the frou-frou fashion 
period about two o’clock. Why 
do you need two dollars?” 

“A dollar for a bed and a 
dollar for red-eye. After all, I 
sent you two million out of my 
second.” 

“I keep my two sorts of ac- 
counts separate. Here’s a dollar, 
Basil. Now be off! I can’t be 
seen talking to a dirty panhand- 
ler.” 

“Thank you, Ildy. I’ll get the , 
red-eye and sleep in an alley. 
Preserve us this morning.” 
Bagelbaker shuffled off whist- 
ling Slow Tuesday Night. 

And already the Dawners had 
set Wednesday morning to jump-

T he great fashion in dealing

shoe-tip bruises on our heels and 
elsewhere. Nor has there been 
as yet a marked thinning-out of 
. either numbers or energy among 
the vigorous proponents of that 
root-bound view. In one aspect, 
that view is nurtured by making 
critical comparisons of stories by, 
say, Paul Janvier, to the writing 
of “the Mainstream.” On those 
rare occasions when something 
more specific is obviously call- 
ed for, the comparison is always 
to, say, John A. Sentry. This is 
because whether the names of 
tiiese two science fiction writers 
are remembered now or not, 
they are obviously safer in each 
other’s arms than they would be 
if party of the second part were, 
say, Herbert Gold, much less 



somebody like Terry Southern. 

I don’t propose to enlarge 
much on this here. My point is 
not that Gold or Southern are 
intrinsically better writers than, 
say Sam 8e Janet Argo. My point 
is tiiat many, many science fic- 
tion people of various degrees of 
graceful intelligence have been 
scared for a long time that they 
are, or have been certain of it 
and have been playing the point 
spread to build little copies of 
Mediterranean viUas for them- 
selves out here just this side of 
Hadrian’s wall. They are now 
having to come to terms with 
the invasion of the cosmopoli- 
tans. 

But what all this means, and 
how it relates to the paramount 
twentieth century dilemma — 
whether to be square or hip — 
are things we must each grope 
for on our own time, since we 
are met here only for the simple 
discussion of books published

within our harmlessly hobbyistic 
circle of entertainment aiicion. 

libness and memory play 
strange tricks, as when I 
recall that my grammar school 
history teacher was fond of say- 
ing that the Holy Roman Empire 
was neither holy nor Roman or 
an empire. Memory calls him to 
mind on the occasion of this re- 
view of the 9th Annual version 
of The Year’s Best SF (Judith 
Merril, Ed., Simon & Schuster, 
$4.95): reason rebels against 

glibness when one considers that 
my grammar school history 
teacher lived partly by refrain- 
ing from trying his borrowed wit 
on Charlemagne (stubborn fel- 
low with a beard; lost at Ron- 
cesvalles but kept his scepter in 
good repair). 

There is less pretense every 
year that the running title of 
this important and often distin- 
guished series has any literal 
meaning. In this year’s compen- 
dium (the year treated by this 
late 1964 book is, of course, 
1963), there are such inclusions 
as Ben Bova’s good article 
“Where is Everybody?”, Jules 
Feiffer’s whimsically vicious car- 
toon feature “Dog Eat Dog”, 
two other cartoons which show 
up callow in contrast to their dis- 
tinguished company, and W.J.J. 
Gordon’s “The Nobel Prize Win- 
ners”, a passing fair piece of 



fiction which is assuredly about 
scientists but is not science fic- 
tion or, sadly, fantasy. And the 
editor herself goes to some 
lengths to explain that the book 
consists of the “best” pieces she 
could find in a complex and 
crowded marketplace; that some 
of them are substitutes for stories 
she would have included had 
she had more room, or world 
enough or time. She is joined by 
Anthony Boucher, among the 
supporting memoranda which 
traditionally leash the various 
stories together and then provide 
the cart for them to pull, in a 
species of lament not only for 
the condition of the marketplace 
but on the diversity of goods 
for sale. 

In short, the editor of this in- 
stitution not only displays a 
great deal of competence in 
maintaining it at all, she then 
tells you how difficult it is, how 
intractable the material, how in- 
creasingly hard it is to ferret out 
its annual significance. 

Meanwhile, back in the book, 
chaos reigns. All the running 
commentary does is make ex- 
cuses for it, where no excuses 
are needed. The stories include 
Allan Danzig’s “The Great Ne- 
braska Sea,” Bernard Malamud’s 
“The Jewbird,” and Cordwainer 
Smith’s “Drunkboat.” Together 
with the Bova article, which of- 
fers a lucid explanation for why 



138 



GALAXY 



we have not been obviously vis- 
ited by extraterrestrials, and the 
Feiffer cartoon feature, these are 
the only instances in which the 
creator has obviously stayed in 
control of his material according 
to his original intention all the 
way and made it seem worth- 
while. The Danzig is also the 
book’s crispest exposition of 
scientific notion, Hal Clement’s 
“Hot Planet” having disqualified 
itself by attempting to also be 
about people. The Malamud is 
a fine, sly fantasy and the “best” 
story in the book, if by that we 
mean it successfully treats of 
the nature of things in and out- 
side the skin. The Smith is as 
usual the obvious triumph of 
emotion over reason, but see 
farther in this column for a 
laudatory view of Smith’s rea- 
soning powers. 

The rest — and it is a long list, 
containing names to conjure 
with, if your taste runs to con- 
juring with Andre Maurois — are 
variously interesting. Some of 
them, like Alfred Hester’s “They 
Don’t Make Life Like They 
Used to” or William Tenn’s 
“Bernie the Faust” do not fluff 
until the last few notes and have 
meanwhile furnished some me- 
morable moments you may well 
prefer to the powerful but strict 
integrity of the Danzig. There 
are one or two things that clear- 
ly embarrassed me to the point 



where my critical faculty went 
dead; apart from the Gerberg 
and Gallagher cartoons, these 
specifically include Richard 
Matheson’s apprentice Crow Jim 
poem, “The Jazz Machine.” 
There are one or two things I 
enjoyed reading while convinced 
they were simply not good 
enough for anything named the 
“best,” even the “best” of such 
a content-free colophon as time 
has made of “SF.” And what 1 
meant by my reference to Maur- 
ois a while back was that even 
Stanton Coblentz, who I fear is 
coming in for some hard licks 
these days after not getting 
enough of them in the 1930s, 
could have handled this idea 
better, and that Miss Merril as- 
suredly knows this, and that 
therefore the inclusion of “The 
Earth Dwellers” is a straight sop 
for the culture vultures. He is 
here not because he has written 
one of the best SF stories of the 
year, and not because the works 
of Andre Maurois are directly 
effective in determining the 
course of science fiction, but be- 
cause someone associated with 
the preparation of this volume 
felt a need, still, to prove the 
respectability of the hands that 
turn to it. But it is not by 
Andre Maurois that the walls 
will be tumbled and the icons 
tom down; it is in any case too 
late to issue engraved invitations

<to the barn-burning, and the 
guest list was compiled by sub- 
versives. 

I think the thing that muses 
me most is that Miss Merril has 
a good thing here, and keeps 
trying to make it something else, 
for formalism’s sake. There is 
great value in having an annual 
collection, scrupulously compil- 
ed, respectably published, which 
to some extent does reflect the 
taste of the one knowledgeable 
person whose name is attached 
thereto. It hardly matters wheth- 
er one story that is in has occu- 
pied space which should have 
gone to a story that is out, be- 
cause the very nature of Miss 
Merril ’s vested interest still gives 
her a broader field of candidates ' 
than any of the rest of us are 
ever going to evaluate anyhow. 
Nor does it matter that the 
ground seems to keep shifting 
nnder the editor’s feet as the 
field makes contact with mean 
ol’ mainstream and we spin to- 
ward the day when it will no 
longer be remarkable that some- 
one has written a Rudyard Kip- 
ling novel set on the planets of 
distant suns, or that Herbert 
Gold, to pick up on my previous 
example, has written a short 
story about people which just 
happens to use a stock sf situa- 
tion to prove its point as it could 
not have been proved in any 
other way. There is more per- 



manent value in calling the series 
Judith MeriiVs Annual of Her 
Favorite SF, and letting it go at 
that, and thus giving us the in- 
evitable fascinating hodge-podge 
and letting the reader make of 
it what he will, than there is in 
trying to cobble the fragments of 
a villa into another villa. Science 
fiction is clearly in a process of 
catastrophic change; Miss Merril 
says so, and the nature of the 
various contents of her book 
says so without her help and 
despite her attempts to make a 
shape out of the flying fragments 
before they have fairly started 
on their way. 

But no one ever listens to me, 
and neither do I, very much. I 
think that what The 9th Annual 
of the Year’s Best SF is most 
interesting for is as a piece of 
evidence for the assertion that 
better and more orderly times 
are coming; that there will be 
SF (whatever that means) by 
writers perhaps yet unborn who 
are always SF writers and yet 
not commercial science fiction 
writers; that there will be a 
healthy and enjoyable, enter- 
taining (meaning “commercial”) 
science fiction which clearly can- 
not be confused with anything 
else, and that we can then all 
pack up our dichotomies and go 
home to our various delights. I 
think the very existence of Miss 
Merril’s series has been a preci-

pitating factor, and that she 
would be happier in her blurbs 
if she relaxed and realized that 
no matter what you call it, it 
is the only empire in town. 

TV To Future In It is a collection 

^ of eleven stories by John 
Brunner, published by Double- 
day at $3.50. Seven of them are 
from British magazines; the 
other four are from the top U.S. 
publications. So this is a collec- 
tion which combines novelty with 
certified competence. 

“No Future in It,” the first 
story in the book, is about a 
medieval charlatan — that is, a 
hapless fellow in a bind because 
he claimed to be a magician — 
who finally succeeds in evoking 
a time traveller within his pen- 
tad e. That is, he benefits by 
fortunate coincidence. 

“Puzzle for Spacemen” is a 
murder mystery in space; the 
outstanding feature of it is the 
repeatedly underscored assertion 
that people doing dangerous 
work in a weightless environment 
would have a very bad time with 
corpses. 

“Fair” is about a government 
agency whose purpose is to pro- 
mote mutual understanding and 
whose gimmick is to disguise its 
modus operandi as a carnival 
entertainment device. The story 
ends with the hero’s discovery 
of this fact. 



“The Windows of Heaven” is 
about the man on the Moon who 
witnesses Earth’s death when the 
sun flares, then goes down to the 
surface to re-seed it with life 
by leaving his own body there. 
At no time does Brunner refer to 
Alfred Bester’s “Adam But No 
Eve,” an oversight. 

“Out of Order” is a gimmick 
story about a super-automated 
service mechanism which has 
been ordered to deliver some- 
thing “yesterday.” Slight but 
good of its kind, this story is 
clearly not in Brunner’s main 
line of work, but does go to 
show that his range includes an 
occasional talent for humor, as 
“No Future in It” failed to do. 

“Elected Silence,” about a 
man who has been kept in soli- 
tary confinement by completely 
inhuman creatures for a very 
long time, and is then rescued 
by our side, is quite good in 
many places; the portrait of the 
central character’s mind is very 
convincing. I have the uneasy 
feeling Brunner thinks his vicious 
Terrestrial military people are 
typical of their class, and that 
his compromising doctor is also 
symbolic of the moderate’s in- 
effectuality. But that’s his red 
wagon ; my basic criticism of this 
story is that it could obviously 
have been told with more econ- 
omy. 

“Badman” is a soc. gimmick 

141 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



story; the attempt to reduce hu- 
man nature to something in a 
test-tube, whereon the propon- 
ent of the scheme-reagent drops 
la his idea and . See the bub- 
bles rise and clarify the people! 
In other words, it’s a story about 
how the idea of setting up straw- 
man hatred surrogates for every- 
one to blow off his aggressions 
keeps the world at peace, and 
furthermore permits the recruits 
to strawdom to feel a lot of de- 
Kciously masochistic pangs at 
how they’ll suffer. (Prose cour- 
tesy your latest college bull-ses- 
sion; please leave a dime for 
beer.) 

“Report on the Nature of the 
Lunar Surface” is another gim- 
mick story, not bad, good enough 
and short enough so that it’ll 
leave its point undisturbed. 

“The Iron Jackass” is an- 
other sociological gimmick story; 
this one, I will not buy even if 
Mbiyu Koinange and Arthur C. 
Clarke both visit my living room 
to explain Indian birth-cries to 
me (Brunner having introduced 
the names of these gentlemen as 
supporting affidavits for a story 
about Slavs). 

“Protect Me from My Friends” 
and “Stimulus,” the last two 
stories in the book, are about 
two different kinds of superman; 
their mutual point seems to be 
that Man will have to be tricked 
into letting new breeds get start- 



ed, and that getting started is 
not necessarily good for new 
breeds. It is the first instance in 
which Brunner betrays any sign 
of realizing that the world and 
the universe are not simple and 
will not yield to simple solu- 
tions. I am as encouraged to see 
it as I am discouraged by the 
auctorial introductions which pre- 
cede each piece. These often 
seem to be about something else 
entirely, and always make each 
story sound the way a cake frost- 
ed with pure Crisco tastes. 

'~T^he Planet Buyer, by Cord- 
wainer Smith (Pyramid 
Books #R-1084, 50c, paper), is 
the author’s first novel. That 
would automatically place it high 
on the reading list, even if Py- 
ramid’s notably honest Don Ben- 
sen were not suggesting it as a 
Hugo candidate. And there is 
more to it than that. But let us 
take it one step at a time. 

The first thing anybody no- 
tices about Smith, of course, is 
technique; the jab, jab, jab of 
his repetitions which may in fact 
be part of a symphonic approach 
to the problem of communica- 
tion; the picking up of clearly 
potent nonsense- words like 
“Vomact” or “Abba Dingo” and 
making characterizations out of 
them at his leisure, if one may 
use that term. I cannot guess 
what Smith thinks he is doing 



142 



GALAXY 



in places like that; I know what 
he does to me, and he does it 
in style. 

The most important thing 
about Smith, I am beginning to 
realize, is that all his stories re- 
late directly to a completely 
consistent phantom universe; 
they are not so much sequels to 
each other as they are tesserae 
in a mosaic, and what appear to 
be loose ends or at best plants 
are in fact integral fragments of 
other parts which will not take 
on their intended function until 
he later lays down the main 
body of that part. What I mean 
is, he does not have a vague 
master plan and a trick of the 
mind which permits him to spin 
off interesting notions he may 
later discover are not suitable 
pegs on which to hang the “next” 
story. There is no next story. 
They are all going on at the 
same pseudo-time, which is as 
real for the phantom universe as 
our pseudo-time is for ours. 

Whether he actually holds the 
complete work in his head at 
this moment is irrelevant to this 
part of my point, this part being 
that the only thing that prevents 
Si^iith from presenting us with 
a completely realized, seamless 
structure which will yield enter- 
tainment and information from 
any angle at any focus and 
speed — just like the real uni- 
verse — is that he is limited by 



his medium to describing infinity 
in finite time. We all are, of 
course, but the rest of us are 
content to take on the job in 
parts, whose exact relationships 
will come as something of a sur- 
prise to ourselves and represent 
a sort of discovery. If we man- 
age to string together five or six 
stories or a couple of novels, we 
do it for the sake of a character 
or a nevertheless straightforward 
idea whose possibilities continue 
to open before us. Not Smith. 
He’s not inventing, he’s report- 
ing. And he’s doing it from God’s 
point of view. 

But whether he does actually 
hold the completed work in his 
head or whether it is unneces- 
sary for him to ever do so — the 
only two possibilities — even a 
149-page book can only be a 
larger piece than Smith has pre- 
viously revealed all at once; it 
cannot possibly be a novel. Or, 
for that matter, a story (it’s too 
long for that). 

This particular piece is dom- 
inated by about half the story of 
Rod McBan, the scion of a fam- 
ily of Norstrilian sheep farmers, 
which automatically means he is 
fabulously wealthy (but only on 
the other side of the tariff barrier 
around his cannily simple home 
world). Thus he became “The 
Boy Who Bought Old Earth” in 
the earlier novelette version. In 
The Planet Buyer, we are pro- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



143 



mised by the author — or per- 
haps by a character in another 
piece who will turn out to have 
been the narrator of this one — 
that we will see the rise of this 
figure and his triumph over the 
volitions that would make of him 
an object rather than a player. 
The promise is not kept; McBan 
when we last see him has under- 
gone some remarkable transfor- 
mations from the heir with a 
shaky title to the legatee of a 
fantastic fortune pyramided for 
him by others, but he has yet to 
move on his own account. Con- 
sidering that Norstrilian sheep 
are the only source of immortali- 
ty drug, that McBan is the only 
handle the rest of the universe 
might grasp to pry Norstrilia 
open, that in Smith’s universe 
there are no heroes or villains 
but rather — to borrow a frame 
of reference I dimly recall from 
somewhere — the hip, the square, 
and things, there is still a great 
deal due to pop, and many 
games to be enjoyed. 

Smith proposes (or the narra- 
tor proposes) that the game is 
with the reader, at the end. It 
is not. He’d get tom apart or 
bored. And actually, I do think 
that Smith is reporting, and will 
file the latest dispatch in due 
course. Where I think he is ac- 
tually reporting from is this uni- 
verse, of course, and he is no 
more God than any of the rest 



at us are. But how many of the 
rest of us have arrived at a 
working hypothesis that lets you 
move toward the advantage 
every time whether you know all 
the conditions or not? 

I suggest that the most inter- 
esting thing about this book is 
that it is of things interesting; 
try some ... a half a dollar is 
what you use it for.

SCIENCE BOOKS 

I n addition to the two astro- 
nomical books discussed in 
the editorial, we have a clutch 
of others worth your attention. 

Thomas Whiteside’s A/one 
Through the Dark Sea (George 
Braziller) is only partly of inter- 
est here, since it is composed erf 
three long essays. One deals with 
Captain Kurt Carlsend and his 
ship, the Flying Enterprise (re- 
member?) one is about the evac- 
uation of the island of Tristan da 
Cimha — and the third, entitled 
To the Cytherean Phase, is the 
one we’re interested in now. It 
is an adventure story of a great 
voyage — the voyage of Mariner 
II to Venus in 1962, described in 
rich and anthropomorphic detail 
What Mariner II reported of 
course, has been the subject of 
great and unceasing debate ever 
since. If its readings, or rather 
the interpretations of its trans- 



144 



GALAXY 



toiissions, are correct, then we 
simply did not know anywhere 
near as much as we thought we 
did about the planet Venus. (All 
in all it seems a less troublesome 
assumption to believe that some- 
how some errors were made in 
Mariner II’s reports.) Neverthe- 
less, the flight was a tremendous 
technical achievement, and 
Whiteside’s essay is probably the 
best lay account you can find. 

Robert G. Aitken’s The Bin- 
ary Stars (Dover) is fairly tech- 
nical and a somewhat dated sur- 
vey of everything that was 
known as of 1935 or so about vis- 
ual, spectroscopic and eclipsing 
binaries. This is a field that dates 
fast. It’s too bad, of course, that 
such puzzles as W Puppis and 
Epsilon Aurigae were not dealt 
with here. Nevertheless, The 
Binary Stars was, and remains, 
a classic in the field. 

Riddles of Astronomy (Basic 
Books) brings back to us a well 
known science - fiction name, 
Otto Binder — who, as half of the 
most famous brother act in 
science fiction, Eando (for Earl 
and Otto) Binder, kept most of 
the sf magazines of the 30’s in 
business. It is a defect of the 
book that Binder wrote it in the 
tones of a science-fiction writer, 
enraptured with the wonder of 
It all. There is far too much gee- 
whiz and over-dramatization, for 
a subject which is already so ex- 



citing and provocative. Yet it 
may be that this sort of color 
will hold readers whose senses 
have been jaded by TV and the 
hard sell; and beyond question 
there is a large budget of inter- 
esting information in the book. 

A fine book (but hardly “ham- 
mock reading’’) by Richard 
Hinckley Allen is called Star 
Names: Their Lore and Mean- 
ing (Dover). Did you know that 
our North Star, Polaris, v/as once 
known as Cynosura? (Meaning 
“the dog’s tail”.) And that from 
this the word cynosure made its 
way into the English language? 
Did you know that the wobbly 
northern “W” we call Cassiopeia 
looked to the Chinese like the 
porch of a house and was called 
Ko Taou? However, if there is 
anything you would like to know 
about what men of all eras have 
seen in the starry skies, this book 
is the place to find it! 

One of the most pleasant and 
gently written handbooks for the 
amateur skygazer is The Friend- 
ly Stars by Martha Evans Mar- 
tin (Dover). Originally pub- 
lished over half a century ago 
(but the skies don’t change! And 
in any event it has been consid- 
erably revised and reexamined 
by Donald H. Menzel), this is a 
first-rate guide for beginners, 
and a pleasant companion for ad- 
vanced starers at the stars.

SCULPTOR 

by C. C. MacAPP 



The plants grew strange fruit — but 
within them was something stranger! 



I mi Frentrup, staring down at 
the planet he’d intended 
never to mention, let alone re- 
visit, seethed with a mixture of 
feelings. There was dread, crawl- 
ing icily up his spine. There was 
the futile rage at this ship’s hard- 
eyed crew and their master, Trux 
Madden. There was self-loath- 
ing for having piloted them here, 
even at gun-point. There was 
the older shame he’d buried in- 
side himself for eight years, since 
he’d lost an exploration crew on 
this planet, smuggled out the 
beautiful and strange little fig- 
urines he couldn’t resist, falsified 
the ship’s logs, lied through the 
hearings, and been permitted to 
resign his commission without 
official disgrace. 

He no longer owned the fig- 



urines, and had never shared in 
the fantastic wealth they now re- 
presented. It must have cost ter- 
rifically, even by Madden’s stan- 
dards, to trace them back to Jim, 
piercing the careful series of 
aliases. He glanced over at the 
man. Madden’s square face show- 
ed none of the excitement he 
must feel; Madden’s hands, bru- 
tal despite manicuring, were 
steady. He met Jim’s eyes and 
said softly, “What are you wait- 
ing for?” 

Jim tried to hold his own 
hands steady as he reached for 
the controls. As the ship drop- 
ped, he realized with surprise 
that among his other feelings was 
a hint of relief. Maybe now some 
of the gaps in his memory would 
be filled in. 



T Te landed where he had be- 
fore, beside a fallen obelisk 
on the wide rock-and-fill dam at 
a constriction of the valley. They 
made him sit where he was for 
half an hour, then Madden came 
to him and said, “I want you to 
go outside and walk around for 
a while. Don’t get more than a 
hundred yards from the ship.” 

Jim got up woodenly and went. 

They’d burned clear the scat- 
tered trees and brush from the 
middle part of the dam. He pick- 
ed a way through smoking ashes 
to the downward side and looked 
out over the old ruins. 

A few rabbity things moved 
among them furtively, and there 
were silent gray birds, but he 
saw nothing bigger. Whoever the 
people had been (there wasn’t 
even a skeleton, but stone sta- 
tues showed them to have look- 
ed like long-tailed sheep stand- 
ing erect), they’d built for more 
permanency than they’d stayed 
to enjoy. Thick rock walls still 
stood, though adobe and timbers 
remained only as traces. The 
city had stretched the length of 
the dam, just below it, protected 
by levees from the two rivers 
that spilled around each end of 
the dam to curve down the sides 
of the widening valley. That had 
been choice bottom land ; and 
from aloft, traces of the irriga- 
tion system could still be seen. 

There’d been terraces along 



both valley slopes, too, for m'^es 
above and below the dam. What- 
ever crops had grown on ter- 
races and bottom land were long 
swallowed up by the natural 
flora, which ran heavily to squat 
trees with coarse cinnamon-color- 
ed bark and twisting horizontal 
limbs that supported lacelike 
sprays of blue-green foliage. 

So far he hadn’t seen anything 
he didn’t remember. He turned 
and w^alked to the lake side of 
the dam. The water was clear 
and placid. Some flattish things 
drifted slowly above the water. 
A pair moved toward him and 
he hoped he remembered rightly 
that they were harmless and al- 
most mindless. They were like 
transparent pancakes, thin but 
three feet across, with thickened 
centers where the vitals were 
and from which radiated carti- 
laginous ribs. They flew by 
scooping air and forcing it down- 
ward and rearward. They circled 
him leisurely, then came close 
and nudged at his head as gently 
as butterflies. Finally, having 
tasted or smelled, they drifted 
out over the lake again. 

He glanced up. The two dots 
in the sky, barely visible, would 
be a pair of ships maintaining a 
telescope watch of the ground. 
The other three would be far- 
ther out, on guard, though the 
chances of anyone else being in 
this sector of space were vanish-

ingly small. Madder, didn’t take 
even small chances unless he had 

to. 

A voice blared from the ship, 
“Frentrup. Come back in now.” 
He turned and walked slowly 
toward the ladder, his anger stir- 
ring anew at the premptory or- 
der. 

He hesitated before climbing 
up, with a strange rel ictance. 
Partly, it might be that he didn’t 
look forward to being caged 
again, nor to the ship’s scru’obed 
atmosphere with its faint smell 
of isopropanol and formaldehyde, 
after the planet’s spicy air Most- 
ly, though, he realized, it had 
something to do with the form- 
less dread. Somehow, the ship 
didn’t seem much protection. He 
wanted to be outside where he 
could see what was coming. 

TV /T adden took him into the 
ship’s salon, which was lux- 
urious (not surprisingly, since 
this was a pirated and re-fitted 
luxury yacht). The outlaw sat 
relaxed, a beamer pistol stuffed 
casually in a pocket. He said, 
“Mix yourself a drink if you 
like.” 

Jim ignored the invitation. 

“The original offer still stands,” 
said Madden. “Work with me, 
and you can have your pick of 
any ship I’ve got, and a bank 
account you can live on com- 
fortably for the rest of your life. 

148 



You ought to realize oy now 
you’ve got nothing to gain by 
holding out.” 

Jim said wearily, “I’ve told 
you a hundred times I’m not 
holding out. I just don’t remem- 
ber.” 

Madden eyed him for a min- 
ute, without expression. “The 
things are solid diamond, not 
cast nor ground. That means 
some kind of fast crystallization, 
which implies a technology be- 
yond ours. I can see, as you told 
me, that there was only an agri- 
cultural civilization here. So, 
either you didn’t get the things 
here, or you got them here from 
other visitors. If you’re protect- 
ing some alien race, you’re wast- 
ing your stubbornness; I’m not 
going to repeat anything I hear 
from you. Self-interest will keep 
me quiet. And I only want a few 
of the things. Too many would 
break the price.” 

Jim scowled at him. “Don’t 
you think I’ve figured out those 
angles? What sense would it 
make for me to hold out now? 
I’m in your hands. If I knew 
anything more I’d be eager to 
tell it, and make myself as use- 
ful as possible. That would be 
my only chance to survive. All 
I know is, I think I got them 
here.” 

“It’s a pity you didn’t keep 
your ship’s true records.” 

“I can quote them to you if 

GALAXY 



you insist,” Jim told him, “word 
for word and figure for figure. 
They won’t mean any more to 
you than they do to me.” 
Madden shifted to a more 
comfortable position. “It’s hard 
for me to believe you sent your 
whole crew out in a bunch, while 
you stayed alone in the ship. The 
X-Corps doesn’t operate that 
way. Nobody does.” 

“It’s no easier for me to be- 
lieve. I told you I had some 
kind of a fever.” 

“Well, we’ve checked the air 
and the ground, and there are 
no germs around here that could 
infect a man. Obviously it wasn’t 
any plague that wiped out the 
natives, or there’d be skeletons, 
at least. What’s your theory 
about that?” 

J im shrugged. “Your theory of 
advanced aliens is as good as 
any. For all I know, they may 
come back in five minutes and 
take us too.” He enjoyed Mad- 
den’s scowl. 

Madden reached for a small 
communicator, and said into it, 
“Bring in the movies.” To Jim 
he said, “I’m going to assume 
for the moment that you’re tell- 
ing the truth. I want to show 
you something.” 

Two men came in and set up 
a translucent screen and a small 
projector. One touched a stud 
and a colored movie appeared 



on the screen. It was a shot of 
Jim coming back to the ship, 
less than half an hour ago, evi- 
dently taken by some hidden 
camera outside. It ran through 
once at normal speed, then start- 
ed over in slow motion and kept 
repeating. 

“Notice anything?” Madden 
asked softly. 

Jim frowned. “Well, I remem- 
ber hesitating before I stepped 
onto the ladder.” 

“Do you remember,” Madden 
asked, “why you turned and 
looked up the lake? You weren’t 
looking at an3dhing nearby.” 

Jim clamped his mouth on a 
retort and watched the screen 
once more. Now that he noticed 
it, there was an instant when he 
turned his head and stared. The 
nameless dread rose in him again. 
He fought to control his face and 
said, “No. I’ll . have to think 
about it.” 

Madden said, “Well, you’ll 
have a few minutes, then we’re 
going up-lake to see if that jogs 
your memory.” 

If only the dream-memores 
would stop billowing around in 
his skull and let him concen- 
trate on what was real! He re- 
membered bending to pick up 
small objects somewhere beside 
this lake. Had those been the 
figurines? All he could say for 
sure was that when he’d come 
out of the delirium the seven 



THE SCULPTOR 



149 



figurines had been in the ship; 
each representing, with an ex- 
quisite and inexplicable art, one 
of the dead crewmen. He hadn’t 
been able to resist them then. 
WrulJ he have, if he’d known 
that men would be murdered 
for them, fortunes squandered on 
mere rumors of them? He 
doubted it. There was more to 
tb^re than mei'e monetary value. 

Hlc thoughts were wrenched 
bar!; to the present as a gunman 
banged on. his compartment door. 
“Madden wants you outside.” 

1\ /T adden and four of his men 
waited, armed with beamer 
rifk": and sidearms. Madden said, 
go up the left side of the 
lake. That’s where you were 
lookhrg. You lead.” 

Jim, unv,'illing to show his fear, 
turnerl and went along the dam. 

H. ? noted that one of the ships 
ovrrhe.ad had come lower and 
no'-- drifted slowly with them. 

To gof to the side of the valley 
thr\' had to cross the river at 
tbmt ond of the dam. He went 
do”- into the ruins and shoved 
through brush to where the 
stre.cn spread out and was shal- 
low Madi’en and three of the 
men followed him closely, while 
one stayed a little behind. Jim 
fo’ind a way across, from boul- 
der to boulder, which he seemed 
ha’f 'o remember, then turned 
upstr.oam, trying to fight off the 

I . 50 



dread that threatened to para- 
lyze his mind. 

This was late summer, and a 
sandy strip lay exposed between 
the water and the crumbling wall 
of the lowest terrace. Now and 
then they had to push through 
reeds. The urgency of his situa- 
tion was pressing in upon Jim 
now. He had little hope that 
Madden would let him live, 
however cooperative he was. It 
would be so much more logical 
to shut him up permanently. 
Now and then he glanced back. 
After half an hour’s walk. Mad- 
den was showing impatience. 

Then, a few minutes later, 
they rounded a bend and he saw 
a wooded promontory ahead. He 
paused, remembering suddenly 
that an old ramp came down 
there, across the terraces from 
the valley’s rim. 

He found that he remembered 
the ramp in detail. Once, it had 
been made firm with heavy 
blocks of stone, and probably 
paved over. Some of the stones 
were exposed now, and some 
were displaced, and twisting gul- 
lies had formed, where water 
came down in the wet season. 
Along the edges, much soil had 
washed down from the terraces 
to form the promontory, which 
projected a hundred feet or so 
into the lake and was wooded 
to the tip. 

Hope leaped in him. If he 
GALAXY 



could get among the trees . 
But as they neared, Madden 
said, “Hold on a second.” He 
was holding a communicator to 
his ear, listening to something 
from the ship overhead. Present- 
ly he lowered the communicator 
and looked at Jim. “They say 
there’s something peculiar just 
ahead.” 

They punctured Jim’s hopes 
by making him wade around the 
promontory instead of crossing 
it. As soon as he was beyond, he 
saw the thing up the shore. 

It was a cluster of large plants, 
on a mound at the water’s edge 
that looked too regular to be 
natural. There were two dozen or 
more vertical stalks, each three 
or four inches thick at the base. 
Every eighteen or twenty inches 
up each stalk was a disc-shaped 
horizontal leaf, two feet in ra- 
dius. Birds and other small crea- 
tures rested on the leaves. As 
he stared, a thing like a frog 
with flying membranes leaped 
from a leaf to soar out over the 
lake and finally plop in. 

T T e knew that this was the 
source of his dread, but 
somehow he didn’t feel any urge 
to flee. It was as if it were some- 
thing he could surely outrun, if 
he had plenty of room to run in, 
and he wasn’t afraid to approach 
fairly closely. He did that, staring 
at the fantastic blossoms fifteen 



feet or more above ground. They 
were like monster orchids; some 
solid hues, some striped or dap- 
pled. All colors, bright or modest, 
were there. Each bloom sent up 
a number of thin wands, also 
multi-colored, that coiled and 
twisted with unmistakable life. 
Several of the flat transparent 
things drifted about the blos- 
soms, and the wands teased at 
them playfully. There was a 
strong perfume in the air, like 
snapdragons but sharper. 

He stopped forty feet away, 
tingling with excitement. One of 
the gunmen came up beside him, 
stared, then suddenly grunted 
and took a step forward, point- 
ing. “Look! Among the stalks!” 

The glittering thing was half- 
buried in the dirt, but it must 
have been the size of Jim’s fore- 
arm. It was a statuette of some 
kind of animal. Eight years be- 
fore, aerial pictures had showed 
herds of grass-eaters and various 
predators, on the rolling lands 
above the valley’s rim, but this 
didn’t look like any of those. Jim 
itched to hold the thing in his 
hands, but restrained himself. 
The gunman wasn’t so cautious. 
He took a step forward . 

Jim must have known what to 
expect, subconsciously, for he 
whirled and ran, bent over, pro- 
tecting his face and hands. Mad- 
den shouted something. A few 
small pellets or seeds (Jim vi- 



THE SCULPTOR 



151 



sualized a shower of them be- 
hind him) flew past him. 

The gunman cried out, then, as 
Jim turned, chuckled sheepishly. 
“Scared me,” he said, wiping at 
his cheek, “I thought — ” 

Suddenly, his face twisted in 
terror. He uttered something be- 
tween a sob and a scream, and 
began to run. He stumbled into 
the water, went down and floun- 
dered, mouthing odd sounds. 
Madden and the other three 
were moving toward him, and 
Madden was shouting into the 
communicator. Then the stricken 
man stood up and waded back 
to shore, silently, face slack. Ig- 
noring the others, he walked like 
a zombie toward the plants. 

Madden yelled at him but he 
gave no sign of hearing. A shim- 
mer began to form around the 
stalks. The blossoms drooped 
and shrank, withdrawing into the 
ground. The shimmer grew, broke 
away, formed a cloud as of very 
fine mist. It drifted to meet the 
zombie-like man. 

AyTadden sent a rifle beam into 
it, causing an agitation, but 
the cloud kept coming. It settled 
over the man, who contorted and 
began to struggle. His mouth 
was open as if he were scream- 
ing, but no sound escaped. His 
clothes began to char and smoke. 
His skin turned red, then black; 
puffed and blistered; showed 



pink cooked flesh v/here it split. 
He was dead now, hanging sus- 
pended in the cloud and turn- 
ing slowly as if weightless. The 
cloud moved back and hovered 
over the mound. More rifle 
beams hit it, but didn’t seem to 
hurt it much. A heavy ship’s 
beam came down, nicked it, and 
did seem to hurt. 

Madden shouted into the com- 
municator, “Don’t shoot!”, evi- 
dently concerned for the statu- 
ettes. There was only a charred 
skeleton left in the cloud, with a 
few metal objects that glowed 
red. Then the bones were gone, 
and the metal vanished, and 
there was only one small point 
of incandescence. The cloud let 
that fall to the dirt, then began 
to split up and seep into the 
ground. Soon it was gone. 

The incandescent thing, about 
the size of a man’s little finger, 
was cooling. Jim knew it would 
be a figurine with all the van- 
ished features perfectly etched 
on its face. 

Madden, eyes deadly, held his 
rifle steady on Jim as they back- 
ed down the shore. “So you 
suckered us after all,” he said 
softly. “This is far enough. Talk.” 

Jim realized that now his only 
chance was to pretend knowing 
more than he did. Otherwise, 
he’d be no more use to Madden. 
“It happened so fast,” he said. 
“I didn’t expect him to go closer. 



152 



GALAXY 



I — you can outrun the things. I 
was going to tell you that.” 
Madden grinned scornfully. “It 
won’t wash. I’m not going to be 
so gentle with you from now on. 
Are there more of them?” 

Jim nodded. “We’d better not 
stay here.” 

Madden glanced around, then 
up at the ship which was set- 
tling toward them. “Where would 
they be? Among the trees?” 

Jim thought fast Instead of 
answering, he let his eyes flick 
nervously toward the lake. If 
Madden had the ship pick them 
up here, Jim was finished. If he 
could get Madden to move back 
to the promontory . 

Madden looked back at the 
mound, where the statuettes lay 
unmoved. “Go get them,” he 
said. 

plain death, from a rifle beam 
for instance, Jim could face 
without panic; but it took all his 
will power to get his legs moving 
back toward the mound. Would 
the thing come out again, or was 
it sated for the time being? Had 
one of these plants consumed all 
seven of his men? He stepped 
gingerly onto the mound, which 
looked freshly plowed now. He 
picked up the big statuette first, 
then hurried to get the five 
others of smaller animals and 
the figurine of the man, which 
was barely warm now. He re- 



treated, stuffing into pockets all 
but the biggest one, which he 
carried. When he was a safe dis- 
tance away he raised the thing 
to his ear, ignoring Madden, and 
thumped it with a finger. It rang 
like the finest crystal glassware, 
throbbingly, persistently. The 
sound permeated his mind, and 
it was as if he dreamed . 

Summer, and sun warm on my 
fur, and good green leaves to 
eat. The young of the grass- 
eaters frisk about and make 
bleating sounds, for they too 
feel the goodness of being alive. 
They’d better beware of that 
predator that crouches at the 
edge of the trees, waiting for 
them to blunder near. He glances 
warily at me, for he knows the 
might of my big taloned paws 
and the crushing weight of my 
body and the grinding strength 
of my big teeth. 

But what is that, drifting 
across the grass? One of the 
Things! I must run! But oh, I 
am a slow creature, and my 
limbs are weak with fright, and 
now it is upon me! Oh — OOOH! 

Jim thrust the thing away 
from him and stood trembling 
and sweating. The agony and 
terror were so vivid . He look- 
ed up and found Madden watch- 
ing him intently. 

Jim’s mind went into high 
gear. He pretended nervousness, 
glancing behind him and up the 



THE SCULPTOR 



153 



lake. When he reached Madden 
he stopped, but acted reluctant. 
Madden looked around. To pick 
them up here, the ship would 
have to land in the water. Mad- 
den nodded to him to start back 
toward the promontory. Jim 
moved, pulse thumping. 

Now if they only didn’t insist 
on his wading around it again 
. He hadn’t acted afraid of 
the water the first time; would 
Madden see through his act now? 
There was one difference. He 
carried the statuettes now. He 
turned, made a vague gesture of 
offering them to Madden, trying 
to look frightened and dazed. 
Madden grinned. “You carry 
them, in case the owner comes 
after them.” 

A t the promontory he started 
out along it slowly, eyes on 
the water. He glanced at Mad- 
den and stopped. Madden said, 
“Go on across,” and moved up, 
with the three men, until the 
rifles were nearly touching Jim. 
Jim was sick with hopelessness. 
How could he hope for any- 
thing? 

Then he noticed that the ship 
was following overhead, and that 
its shadow drifted along just be- 
hind them. His heart jumped. 
Maybe . But he needed some 
other distraction, to set that up. 

He climbed the side of the 
promontory and picked a way 



among the trees. He pretended 
to stumble and, leaning for a 
moment against a tree-trunk, un- 
obtrusively got one of the small- 
er statuettes out of a pocket. He 
went on, holding the thing in 
front of him. He was nearing the 
other side of the promontory; he 
could see water ahead. It would 
have to be now. 

He forced his way through 
some brush, and, as soon as it 
concealed him below the shoul- 
ders, flipped the statuette ahead 
of him. Would it reach the wat- 
er? It did, just barely. At the 
splash he halted and crouched 
as if startled. He half-turned his 
head slowly, gave Madden what 
he hoped was a terrified look. 
Then he let his eyes shoot past 
the men and go wide. “Look 
out!” The ship’s shadow fell 
upon the trees. They whirled, 
rifles swinging up, and he was 
running, bent so the brush would 
hide him, up the promontory, 
trying to put tree trunks be- 
tween himself and Madden. 

Madden shouted, and beams 
sliced around him, blasting 
chunks out of the trees. One 
scorched his right cheek and he 
dodged desperately and went on, 
legs pumping. He risked turning 
right, and it was lucky he did 
for a heavy ship’s beam crashed 
where he’d been headed. He took 
the second terrace up and pushed 
along it as fast as the dense 



154 



GALAXY 



undergrowth would let him. He 
felt exultant nojv, though his 
lungs ached te’ribly. The trees 
hid him completely from over- 
head and from all sides; and the 
sound of the ship’s weapons, 
blasting along the promontory, 
covered any noise he made. 

Madden must have realized 
that, for he shouted . and the 
firing stopped. Jim stood still 
for a moment, but there was a 
crackling of trees on fire behind 
him, that would mask any small 
noise he made. He pushed on 
slowly, and found a chance to 
climb up one more terrace. He 
thought he’d best get as high as 
he could, and as far up-lake. 

For the first time, he realized 
that he still clutched the biggest 
statuette, and had the others in 
his pockets. Was* that good or 
bad? If he’d dropped them in 
the open. Madden might take 
them and not bother about Jim. 
Now, he’d be thinking of getting 
them. On the other hand, maybe 
he wouldn’t let the ships fire for 
fear of ruining them. 

The sound of the forest fire 
was falling behind, but then he 
heard similar sounds, faintly, 
ahead. He stopped again and lis- 
tened. The sounds were coming 
from all directions. Suddenly, he 
understood. Madden had called 
the other ships down, and they 
were etching a ring of fire around 
him to pen him in. 



The gray birds, recognizing 
something wrong, were flitting 
back and forth in agitation. For 
a second Jim thought he could 
feel heat, then he recognized that 
it was only the ache in his 
scorched cheek. He pondered 
which way to go. The fire would 
probably bum up the slope fast- 
er than down. He climbed an- 
other terrace. Maybe he could 
find a cave or something, hoi* 
up and let the fire bum past him, 
then escape. It was only an how 
to sundown. But of course th* 
ships had floodlights. 

TV /Tadden’s amplified voice 
boomed from somewhere 
above the trees. “Frentrup, you 
haven’t a chance. I’m going t® 
make you one more offer. There’s 
a level spot on the ramp, at the 
fourth terrace from the bottom, 
where there’s no fire. Bring the 
statues out and leave them, and 
we’ll leave you here alive. That’ll 
suit me just as well as killing 
you.” 

There was no more for fifteen 
minutes, while the fires got clos- 
er. Then Madden added, “Don’t 
think I’ll worry about damaging 
the statues. We’ve spotted more, 
and I can pick up all I want 
I’d just rather save the trouble. 
Bring the ones you’ve got to the 
ramp. We’ll leave you a pistol 
and some supplies. Yell if you 
agree. We’ll hear you.” 



THE SCULPTOR 



155 



No doubt they would; they’d 
have sound pickups aimed 
around. Jim didn’t believe Mad- 
den would let him live, and any- 
way, he wasn’t going to crawl 
for Madden. He kept looking 
for a cave. The valley was al- 
most in dusk, and the glow of 
the fires was beginning to show. 
The birds were all gone, and 
other forest creatures were run- 
ning about in fright. Something 
big charged by Jim, snarled, and 
went on. 

Madden didn’t speak again, 
and Jim went on with his search. 
There were hollows beneath 
boulders of the old terrace walls, 
but none looked good enough. 
He was getting worried; it was 
dark and his eyes stung from 
the smoke. He found one hollow 
that would almost do, but de- 
cided to look farther. 

A few minutes later a beam 
crashed into the trees scant 
yards away, seemingly at ran- 
dom. Each started a fire, and 
each fire made the smoke worse. 
Desperate, he ran back to the 
hollow he’d rejected, knelt and 
scooped out dirt to make it 
bigger. His eyes were streaming 
now, and fits of coughing tied 
him in knots. 

A beam crashed on the terrace 
above him, and a burning branch 
came down. He threw it off and 
rolled frantically in the moist 
dirt, but his clothes were burned 



through and there was a bad 
bum on his neck. He squirmed 
into his hole and pushed dirt up 
before him for protection. A big 
limb came down, one mass of 
flame, and sealed him in. He dug 
with fingers that bled and heap- 
ed up dirt, twisted and tried to 
find breathable air in the hole, 
but a fit of coughing seized him 
so that he was paralyzed. 

His back stung like the devil, 
and his lungs felt as if a blow- 
torch had been turned into them. 
If he got through this he’d have 
to find mud, or some animal 
grease to smear on his burns. But 
he was beginning to feel that he 
wasn’t going to get through. He 
was almost in a coma from the 
coughing. “Damn him!” he 
groaned, “Damn him! I hope 
he—” 

'"T^hen it was as if something 
moved physically inside his 
skull, and a calm thought came, 
“/’// take over now.” Whatever 
was tmly Jim Frentrup scream- 
ed, fought a brief desperate re- 
sistance, and was overwhelmed. 

/ can change safely, he thought, 
but I haven't enough substance 
to do much. I could reach un- 
burnt foliage, but that’s such 
lean fare. Animals? They’ve all 
fled. The men in the ships? Too 
dangerous, all by myself. 

He consumed parts of the Jim- 
body, bolstering the brain and 



156 



GALAXY 



whatever else was required for 
temporary life; materialized a 
root-tip and thrust it down into 
the soil; sent out thin filaments, 
searching. A few feet down he 
found an inter-colony contact- 
root half an inch thick. He ab- 
sorbed back his other filaments 
and grew them into the right one 
until it would carry a message. 
Brothers! Attend! 

Who are you? came a drowsy 
reply, You feel odd. 

It is I, who entered the intel- 
ligent animal and went into the 
sky. Henceforth, I wish to be 
called Jim-entity. There is dan- 
ger! There are more of the ani- 
mals — they are called ‘men' — 
and they hove weapons that can 
hurt! 

Another awareness joined in, 
half awake. 

We are aware of them. I dined 
upon one. They will go away 
soon, in their hollow metal things 
that fly. 

Attend! Jim-entity demanded, 
insistently. There are a thousand 
worlds full of them, and they 
have weapons that can blast us 
to atoms! We must seize them 
before they go! 

They were coming full-awake 
now, more of them joining in. 
Some of them, feeling his weak- 



ness, sent power flowing along 
the root, and he drank it in 
thirstily. Then Old One came 
awake; he who ate little, slept 
much, and who, it was whispered 
in awe, had come long ago from 
the sky. His feel was amused. 
So; the young traveller has re- 
turned. What did you learn be- 
yond the sky? 

I learned much. Marvels, which 
there is no time to describe; and 
feelings, which are strange things 
but which I would not give up 
now. I have learned to love. And 
to hate. 

power was throbbing along the 
root now. He said, I will send 
a few small clouds first, to enter 
the ships unseen, for insurance. 
Then we will form more clouds 
to carry the seeds, and try to 
capture all the men. We can de- 
cide later which ones to consume 
and which to hide in, so they 
will take us to others of their 
kind. 

Good! approved the Old One, 
more vigorously than anyone had 
ever heard him speak, It is time 
we moved again. We have fal- 
lowed here long enough. 

Someone else said. There will 
be many fine statues.

■professor Peter Elton swung his 
-*■ machete half-heartedly at a 
hanging vine as thick as his 
wrist; the blade rebounded with 
a dull clunk. He lowered the 
black pigskin suitcase in his left 



hand to the spongy layer of rot- 
ted vegetation that covered the 
ground, took out a large hand- 
kerchief with a faded machine- 
stitched monogram belonging to 
a fellow customer of the Colle- 
giate Laundry and Cleaners, and 
mopped at his face.

“Constable Eoyle,” he called 
to the stoc’.-y, Hia’ci-clad man 
whacking at the dense verdure 
ahead. “Are you sure you know 
where we’re going?” 

Boyle turned, flicked the sweat 
from the end of his nose. 

“Absolutely, sir,” he called 
cheerily. “Chased that ruddy 
great jaguar right through this 
same ruddjr thicket. Lost him at 
the river’s edge — the Choluteca, 
that is. That would be about five 
miles ahead.” 

Elton groaned. He hobbled to 
a convenient log, sat, pulled off 
his brand-new hiking boots, and 
began massaging his foot. 

“But we don’t have to go all 
that way, sir,” Constable Boyle 
reassured him. “It was on the 
way back I stumbled over it; 
it can’t be far from where we 
are at this moment.” 

“I can’t help recalling my last 
ill-advised venture into the 
brush,” Elton said. “An unspoil- 
ed Aztec site just twenty miles 
south of Taxco. We reached it 
after a fourteen hour burro ride. 
After clearing away the greenery, 
I uncovered a Dr. Pepper sign, 
several hundred beer bottles, and 
the principle chassis members of 
a Model T Ford.” 

“This is the real thing, sir,” 
Boyle said heartily. “Just this 
column, like, sticking up; bloody 
great slab o’ rock the size of a 
Bentley Tourer.” 



“And you’re sure it shows signs 
of human handicraft?” 

“Oh, that I can guarantee, sir. ’ 
Boyle got out a well-worn hip 
flask, passed it across to Elton, 
who uncapped it and took a heal- 
ing draught. “I hope you’re not 
thinking of packing it home as a 
souvenir,” Boyle went on. “You’d 
need a ruddy derrick.” 

“Nothing like that, constable,” 
the professor said. “I’ve already 
told you I merely wish to ex- 
amine it; make a few tests.” 

CCT understand; that’s what 
A that bloody great case is 
in aid of . .” He nodded at the 
heavy piece of expensive-looking 
luggage at Elton’s feet. “I wish 
you’d let me carry it for you for 
a bit.” 

“No, no. I’ll see to this, con- 
stable.” Elton put a protective 
hand on the case. “The device I 
have here — which I developed 
myself — may well revolutionize 
the whole art of archaeological 
dating.” 

“That’s a bit over my head, 
sir,” the constable said. 

Elton took another swig from 
the flask and handed it back. 
“With the chronalyzer — ” he 
patted the case — “I’ll be able to 
establish the ages of stone arti- 
facts which have hitherto defied 
analysis. You see, the incidence 
of naturally occuring high-velo- 
city particles on exposed rock

surfaces induces sub-microscopic 
changes in the internal crystal- 
line structure of the material ; 
naturally, when a cut is made in 
a stone surface by man — ” 
“Who cares how old a blink- 
ing rock is?” Boyle cut in. “Now, 
my idea is, you can vet this 
thing, say whether it’s worth the 
trouble of doing a bit of digging; 
then if we turn up an5rthing — 
say a few solid-gold chamber 
pots — ” 

“Now, constable, I’m not in- 
terested in visionary schemes to 
defraud the authorities.” 

“Defraud, sir? That’s rather a 
harsh term. As for meself, my 
salary as a blooming game war- 
den is — ” 

“Is none of my business,” El- 
ton pulled his boots on and got 
to his feet. “I suggest we resume 
while the sunlight is good.” 

“As you say, sir. But it seems 
a shame, considering the fact 
that we’re a good fifty miles from 
Tegucigalpa and there’s boats on 
the river to be had for a song.” 
“I don’t sing very well,” Elton 
said severely. “I have an ade- 
quate position with a reasonably 
good, small university and a full 
professorship in the offing if my 
chronalyzer proves out. That is 
the sole purpose of this expedi- 
tion.” 

Boyle squinted at the sun. 
“We’d best be moving if we want 
to be back to Yuscaran tonight.” 



T ate sunlight was filtering 
' through high treetops where 
green parrots had set up a rau- 
cous evening serenade among the 
orchids when Boyle stumbled 
into a tiny clearing, yelled “Ha!” 
and pointed. 

Elton came up beside him, his 
once natty bush jacket hanging 
damply, his solar topi on back- 
wards, his shins scratched. Be- 
fore him, a two-yard thick cylin- 
der thrust up from a tangle of 
flowering viner, its weathered 
surface almost obscured by a 
growth of grayish moss. 

‘Well, it appears to be artifi- 
cial, just as you said,” Elton 
commented. He gazed at the 
ten-foot high monument, circled 
it, studying the surface. 

“Not much over a thousand 
years old,'' I’d guess,” he said. 
“The Mayan stone-workers — ” 
“Why not try your apparatus 
on it and find out for sure?” 
Boyle suggested. “Then perhaps 
we might do just a bit of dig- 
ging.” 

“No digging,” Elton said firm- 
ly. He squatted by the case con- 
taining the chronalyzer, noting 
the scars and scratches in the 
once-splendid leather. He re- 
membered the dinner the pre- 
vious spring at which the lug- 
gage had been presented to him, 
along with a nice little check, on

the occasion of his award-win- 
ning paper on Some Evidences 
ot an Advanced Technology 
Among Pre-Columbian Central 
Americans. What would his col- 
leagues say, he wondered, open- 
ing the case, if he returned from 
this trip with proof of the chron- 
alyzer’s success? 

“Crikey,” Boyle said, leaning 
over to peer into the case. “Looks 
like the insides of a reddy telly 
set.” 

“Oh, it’s quite simple, really,” 
Elton said, erecting the folding 
tripod he had taken from the 
case. I merely expose the surface 
in question to radiation of spe- 
cific wave-length, and the re- 
sultant refraction patterns are 
interpreted by the sensor unit; 
the results are read directly from 
the screen here. Later, of course, 
it would be a simple matter to 
devise a direct-reading scale.” 

He lifted the chronalyzer from 
the case, settled it in position 
on the tripod, then flipped a 
switch, and checked indicator 
dials. Power was flowing at the 
correct levels. He sighted through 
an eye piece, fine focused the 
crystal-guided light source, then 
flipped down the toggle switch 
which bombarded the target with 
high-range ultra-violet. A beam 
of pale light made a gray spot 
on the curve of mossy rock. The 
constable stood at Elton’s shoul- 
der, staring at the wavering green 



glow of the four-indi square in- 
dicator screen, watching th« 
wave-forms dance. 

“What’s that wiggly line 
mean?” he inquired. 

“Hmmm.” Elton studied the 
pattern, compared it with the 
scale taped to the panel above 
the glass. “Curious; the surface 
seems to date about eight thou- 
sand years back. That is, it was 
exposed to the open air at about 
that date.” 

^’T^.here was a harsh, grating 
sound, a sense of vibration 
deep underfoot. Elton stepped 
back, looking startled. Before 
him, the stone seemed to trem- 
ble . 

“Here, what’s that?” the con- 
stable’s voice had a note of sur- 
prise. “You feel that, sir?” 

The vibration was very per- 
ceptible now. The stone was 
quivering visibly. Elton hastily 
switched off tihe chronalyzer. 
With a loud click! A hairline 
crack became visible running 
from top to bottom of the loom- 
ing cylinder. The crack widen- 
ed; curved panels were opening 
out, sliding silently on oiled 
bearings. A bluish light winked 
on, revealing an interior cham- 
ber lined with fittings of an in- 
comprehensible complexity. 

“It’s not . not one of these 
missiles, sir?” 

A loud beep! came from the 



162 



GALAXY 



interior of the apparition. Elton 
Jumped. 

“Ascrabilik ahubarata” an in- 
human, metallic voice said from 
inside the capsule. 

“That’s not Rooshian, is it, 
«ir?” 

“Definitely not Russian,’’ El- 
ton said, backing away. 

“You had me fooled, sir,” 
Boyle said. “Nice bit o’ camou- 
flage it was, too.” He chuckled. 
“I’d of wagered you’d never been 
here before; a jolly good act you 
put on.” 

“Thank you, constable,” El- 
ton said in a squeaky voice, 
mentally picturing squads of 
armed security men pounding 
through the jungle to take him 
into custody. “But how,” he pic- 
tured himself asking, “was I to 
know that there was a secret 
minuteman silo under this old 
rock . F’ 

“You scientist blokes,” the cop 
said. “You’re full of surprises.” 
He shook his head admiringly. 

“Yes,” Elton mumbled, going 
into motion suddenly. “Well, 
thanks for your cooperation, con- 
stable. We may as well be run- 
ning along now.” He lifted the 
chronalyzer from its tripod, low- 
ered it into the case. 

“You’re going to leave it like 
this, sir?” The constable’s eye- 
brows went up. 

“We’re pressed for time,” El- 
ton said hurriedly. “We don’t 



want to be caught out in the 
jungle after dark . .” 

“Ascrabilik ahubarata,” the 
voice said again. 

ttTTere, sir, where’s the voice 
coming from?” The con- 
table poked his head inside the 
blue-glowing interior, his voice 
taking on an echoic quality. 
“What’s — ” A sharp buzz cut 
him off in mid-sentence. He stiff- 
ened, his arms jerking out from 
his sides; a dazed look spread 
over his face. A pair of bright 
metal clamps had extended from 
a receptacle, locked into the con- 
stable’s head. Elton jumped for- 
ward, grabbed his arm, and haul- 
ed at him. The buzz stopped 
abruptly, the clamps retracted. 
The constable staggered back, 
his hands to his head. 

“Wh-What happened?” he 
choked. “Felt like my ruddy 
brains was being wrung out like 
a bar-rag!” 

“Mobile Command Center Ten 
ninety-four, standing by for in- 
structions,” a harsh, high-pitched 
voice with a Middlesex accent 
said from inside the capsule. 

“You might’ve warned me, 
sir,” the constable said in a hurt 
tone. 

“Uh . well, after all, these 
secret installations . .” Elton 
improvised. “But I’ll explain it 
all as we hike out.” 

“MCC Ten Ninety-four, await- 



WAR AGAINST THE YUKK8 



163 



Ing instructions,” the voice said 
again. “On five minute stand-by 
alert, counting . 

“Where’s the chap manning 
this show, an 3 Tway?” the con- 
■table asked. “They oughtn’t to 
go off and leave it like this.” 

“Probably they just stepped 
•ut for coffee. No concern of ours, 
constable. Now, if you’ll just 
give me a hand with the bag.” 

“Abandoned their post? Very 
•trange, I’d call that, sir. Un- 
British. But then I suppose 
tiiey’re Wogs.” 

“MCC Ten ninety-four await- 
ing instructions. Battle status, 
active.” 

“You hear that sir? Blimey, do 
you suppose it’s started? I knew 
that we couldn’t trust those Rus- 
skis!” 

“Just a routine exercise, I 
should think,” Elton soothed, 
edging off into the surrounding 
undergrowth. “Now if you’re 
ready — ” 

“Here,” the constable said 
loudly, addressing his remarks 
to the capsule. “Constable Boyle 
here. What’s this about a bat- 
tle?” 

“Battle report follows,” the 
voice answered. “First Grand 
Fleet, annihilated, casualties to- 
tal; Second Grand Fleet annihi- 
lated, casualties total; Third 
firand Fleet . .” 

The voice went on, reeling off 
•tatistics. 



tt'^his is It, right enough!** 
Constable Boyle smack- 
ed a fist into his palm. “A hell 
of a fight going on somewhere 

“. Grand Fleet annihilated, 
casualties total,” the voice dron- 
ed on. “Sixth Grand Fleet, cas- 
ualties ninety-eight percent; sur- 
viving units retired to defensive 
dome at station 92, under Yukk 
siege — ” 

“Ever heard of these Grand 
Fleets?” Boyle called to Elton. 
“That would be your lot, I reck- 
on?” 

“Certainly not,” Elton said 
quickly. “Just code names; you 
know; the Blue Army versus the 
Red Army — ” 

“Never had any use for bloody 
Reds meself,” Boyle stated flat- 
ly. “Well if it’s not you Yanks, 
it must be British units involved. 
Always knew we were keeping a 
secret weapon tucked away 
someplace. Who’d have thought 
it’d be here in Honduras? But 
our chaps are in trouble, from 
the sound of it.” 

. Tenth Grand Fleet; Mo- 
bile Command Center Ten nine- 
ty-four standing by.” 

“Ten ninety-four? That’s this 
apparatus here!” Boyle said ex- 
citedly. “And its ruddy crew’s 
stepped out for tea!” 

“If we hurry,” Elton called 
cheerily. 

“I don’t like the sound of this,” 



164

Boyle said. “Looks like the 
bloody Reds have had all the 
best of it, so far.” He raised his 
voice to shout into the interior 
of the capsule. 

“What kind of shape are the 
other blighters in?” 

“Yukk Primary Echelon, an- 
nihilated, casualties total; Yukk 
Secondary Echelon, heavy cas- 
ualties. Yukk Dreadnought 
Abominable operational, standing 
by off station 90 — ” 

“Yukks, eh? Code name for 
the Russkis, shouldn’t wonder,” 
Boyle said. “And their dread- 
nought’s got a group of our lads 
hemmed in at someplace called 
station 92. They’ll be wanting 
a spot of help, sir!” 

“Elements of Sixth Grand 
Fleet under siege at station 92. 
Besieging Yukk Dreadnought 
heavily outweighs units in ton/ 
seconds firepower.” 

“We’ve got to get cracking, 
sir!” Boyle yelled. “We can’t let 
the Bolsheviks wipe our chaps 
out!” 

“Awaiting instructions,” the 
voice said. “Three minute alert” 

< C T T ere, where’s your station 
complement?” Boyle de- 
manded. 

“Station personnel departed to 
conduct local reconnaissance,” 
the voice stated. 

The constable whirled on El- 
ton. “It’s clear enough, sir; these 



chaps have buggered off and left 
their mates in the lurch. Lucky 
we happened along. It’s awaiting 
our instructions!” 

“Now, constable,” Elton said 
reasonably. “Surely it’s not talk- 
ing to us — ” 

“Who bloody else? It popped 
open when we came along, didn’t 
it?” 

“I suppose my U-V triggered 
sometliing,” Elton muttered. 

Boyle looked suddenly know- 
ing. “Ah-hah, I think I see, sir. 
Security. You can’t take action 
while I’m hanging about.” 

“Well, constable,” Elton grab- 
bed at the straw, “you don’t 
expect me to violate NATO Cos- 
mic security?” 

“I’ll never breathe a word sir, 
cross my heart!” Boyle was 
standing at attention, chin in, 
toes out. ‘We’ve got to give 
them a leg up, sir!” 

“Out of the question, consta- 
ble,” Elton said, looking around 
for the first signs of flashing red 
lights, whooping sirens, and 
pouncing military police. 

“You’re a cool one, sir,” Boyle 
said stiffly. “Have to be, I sup- 
pose, in the counter-espionage 
game. But it’s not the British 
way to desert one’s mates in time 
of need.” 

“One’s mates? What in the 
world are you talking about? 
We’ve stumbled into some sort 
of war games, constable; if we’re

here when the authorities arrive, 
we’ll end up in a maximum-se- 
curity prison!” 

“I’m saying it’s the real thing, 
sir. Our boys are under fire. 
They’re counting on us, sir!” 

“What the devil do you ex- 
pect me to do?” A strident note 
had entered Elton’s voice, re- 
minding him of his last interview 
with Dean Longspoon, in which 
the irascible department head 
had suggested that Elton spend 
more time in the classroom and 
less in what he termed exotic 
peregrinations. How right, Elton 
thought, the dean had been. 

“We’ll fill in for these blinking 
tea-drinkersf” Boyle proposed. 
“And I’ll have a word for their 
superiors when this is over!” 

“But — but— ” 

“Two minute alert,” the voice 
stated. 

“I always thought when the 
chips were down you Yanks 
would stand with us,” Boyle 
said. “I’m going in — alone, if I 
have to.” 

“But — it might be danger- 
ous.” 

“Chance we have to take,” 
Boyle said curtiy. “Coming?” 

Elton came slowly across to 
Boyle’s side, looked into the 
dim blue interior of the capsule, 
at a maze of pin-point indicator 
lights, conduits, push-buttons, 
fittings. 

“Hmmm. Interesting layout. 



New type oscilloscope, subminia- 
ture fluorescents — ” 

“Awaiting instructions; one 
minute alert before reverting to 
inactive status,” the voice said. 

“Go ahead, sir!” Boyle urged 
“I’m right behind you!” 

Elton looked around; there 
were still no signs of aroused se- 
curity forces bearing down. He 
put the suitcase on the ground, 
sighed, and stepped hesitantly 
through the open entry. 

Ill 

\ t once, a folding seat deploy- 
ed from the floor, nudged 
the back of Elton’s knees, and he 
sat abruptly. Boyle crowded in 
behind him. Elton stared at the 
array of tiny dial faces and tog- 
gles, packed together like a dis- 
play in a bargain jeweler’s win- 
dow. 

“Say, you’ve got to hand it to 
those Air Ministry bods,” Boyle 
said. “Not half crafty, that lot. 
Not a word in the papers about 
all this.” He was looking around 
admiringly at the wilderness of 
quivering needles. 

“Thirty second alert,” the voice 
stated. 

“Wonder what that means?” 
Elton frowned. 

“In twenty-five seconds. Mo- 
bile Center will revert to per- 
manent inactive status if not ac- 
tivated,” the voice said.

“Yoa mean — well be out of 
the fight?” Boyle expostulated. 

“Affirmative. Actitm must be 
taken within prescribed time lim- 
it, in accordance with standard 
anti-Yukk operational proce- 
dures.” 

“Suppose we don’t?” 

“Mobile Center will detonate. 
Fifteen second warning.” 

Elton started out of his seat. 
“Fifteen seconds — let’s get out 
of here!” 

“We can’t sir!” Boyle caught 
his arm. “It’s too late now to 
run! If it blows, it’ll take us to 
kingdom come!” 

“What’ll I do?” 

“Anything, sir! Just jab a 
button at random!” 

Elton dithered, then lunged 
for the panel, depressed a fat 
red button directly before him. 
Instantly, metal bands snapped 
around his mid-section, clamp- 
ing him to the seat. Behind him, 
Boyle grunted, similarly re- 
strained. 

“Prepare for immediate jump 
to Battle Sector,” the voice said 
emotionlessly. The curved door 
slid shut with a smooth sigh. 
The blue glow died, leaving only 
tlie jewel-sparkle of the instru- 
ments. 

“Hold on here,” Elton yelled, 
tugging at the seat belt. There 
was an abrupt jar, an instant’s 
pause — then a silent concussion 
that seemed to burst painlessly 



inside his skull. Boyle gave a 
choked shout — then all was si- 
lent and still again. 

“S-sir?” Boyle got out. 

“What . happened?” Elton 
managed. 

“Sir, I’ve got a feeling . 
we’re floating, sort of.” 

ttXJonsense; the thing mal- 
^ functioned, obviously. 
Whatever was supposed to hap- 
pen didn’t. Perhaps it was never 
intended to. I’m beginning to 
suspect that we’re the victims 
of the most idiotic practical joke 
of the decade!” Elton tugged at 
the seat clasp. “Now I suppose 
we’re trapped here until they 
decide to come along and — ” 

“On station. Battle Sector 
Nine,” the voice announced. “Re- 
quest permission to deploy view 
screens.” 

“By all means, deploy the 
view screens,” Elton said wear- 
ily. “And by the way, just who 
the devil are you? Where are 
you speaking from? What’s this 
farce all about, an5rway? My 
name is Elton, and I demand — ” 

“This is the Lunar Battle 
Computer,” the voice said. “I 
am positioned nine point three 
four two miles under the Lunar 
surface feature known as Mount 
Tycho. At your instruction, I 
have placed Mobile Command 
Center Ten-ninety-four on sta- 
tion in Battle Sector Nine, four

thousand miles off Callisto, on 
an intercept course with the 
Yukk Dreadnought Abominable. 
Request permission to deploy 
forward batteries.” 

“You mean — you really — I 
mean — ” Elton tried twice to 
swallow, made it on the third at- 
tempt. “This /s all some ghastly 
joke?” he croaked. 

“Negative,” the voice said flat- 
ly. It seemed to issue from a 
small slot set among the flashing 
lights — which were now blinking 
with renewed e.nthusiasm. A large 
amber X in mid-panel winked 
on and off frantically. 

“Callisto,” Boyle said. “I’ve 
heard of it. Somewhere near Ja- 
maica, I believe.” 

“Someone’s idea of humor,” 
Elton croaked. He managed a 
stifled laugh. “Why, if we were 
really four thousand miles off 
Callisto, we’d be hundreds of 
millions of miles away deep in 
space.” 

“Space, sir?” 

“Callisto is — ” he swallowed 

— “one of the moons of Saturn 

— or is it Jupiter?” 

“Jupiter,” the voice said tone- 

lessly. 

“Jupiter? Well, now, I knew 
our lads were holding something 
back,” Boyle said complacently. 
“You Yanks and your moon 
shots are all very well, but here 
we British are, all the way out 
on Jupiter. Goes to show . 



H/^oes to show what?” Elton 
yelped. “Suppose this 
thing knows what it’s talking 
about? Do you know anything 
about piloting a satellite . 
his voice trailed off in a squeak. 
Two translucent panels which 
had slid down from slots above, 
opened out, glowed briefly, then 
snapped into the crystal clarity 
of the finest photograph. Against 
a background of utter black, 
blazing points of light flared and 
sparkled. To the left, a brilliant 
curve of light like an enormous 
full moon edged into the picture. 
The screen above showed a sim- 
ilar scene, with the familiar tiny 
ringed disc of Saturn glowing, 
bright-edged, off to one side. In 
the center of the screen a moving 
blip glowed. 

“There you are,” Boyle said 
proudly, indicating Jupiter. “Bri- 
tish soil, the whole lot.” 

There was a loud ping! 

“What was that?” 

“Yukk suppressor rays have 
locked on Command Center,” 
the voice said in the same emo- 
tionless tone. “Likelihood of im- 
mediate salvo fire.” 

“Fire? You mean they’re 
shooting at us? Goodness. Who 
would want to do that — ?” 
“Yukk dreadnought on closing 
course,” the Lunar Computer an- 
nounced. “Request instructions.” 
“Take evasive action!” Elton 
yelled. “Get us out of here!”

“Drive mechanism non-func- 
tional in field of Yukk suppres- 
sor rays,” the voice said. 

“Uh — fire the forward bat- 
teries!” Elton yelled. 

“Guns non-operative in field 
of Yukk suppressor rays.” 

On the screen the blip grew; 
it swelled visibly, bearing down 
at a headlong clip. Elton could 
make out details of the image 
now. A clumsy, double-pyramid 
shape, slab-sided, angular, rush- 
ing at him from dead ahead. 

“Nothing for it but to ram, 
sir!” Boyle yelled. “God save 
the Queen!” 

Elton lurched forward as the 
capsule seemed to break sudden- 
ly. The pressure grew. Elton 



grunted as the seat clamp cut 
into his stomach. 

“Yukk tractor rays now grap- 
pling Command Center,” the 
voice said indifferently. “Request 
permission to self-destruct.” 
“Not bloody likely!” Boyle 
bawled. “We’re not ruddy Kami 
Kazis!” 

^^he pressure slacked off. The 
forward screen went dark, 
filled by the bulk of the Yukk 
dreadnought. In the rear screen 
the stars glittered and winked. 
A tremor ran through Elton’s 
seat — a sharp jar, a sense of 
diding, then silence again. 

“We — we’ve stopped,” Elton 
said uncertainly.

"What do you suppose it 
means, sir?” Boyle said in a 
strained voice. “I’d have wager- 
ed a fiver we were bound to 
collide with that monster.” 
“We’re practically bumping 
into it now.” 

“We must be hove to along- 
side,” Boyle said. 

“I . I suppose they’ll be 
along to collect us any minute 
now,” Elton said. 

“Captured,” Boyle said dis- 
gustedly. “Without firing a shot.” 
“By the Yukks,” Elton added. 
“We’ll be brainwashed ...” 
“There’ll be help on the way, 
sir,” Boyle said cheerfully. 
“When the chaps we’re filling for 
get back and find their machine 
missing, they’ll be through to 
Air Ministry like a shot.” 

“I wonder what they’re wait- 
ing for?” 

Elton stared at the dark 
screen, unable to make out de- 
tails of their captor. “I’d like to 
get on to the name-rank-and- 
serial-number part, and possibly 
get in touch with the Red Cross.” 
“Pity we’re not armed,” Boyle 
said. “We could have put up a 
spirited defense, and maybe tak- 
en a couple of the blighters with 
us.” 

Elton didn’t answer; he was 
swallowing hard, running over 
speeches : 

I am a civilian, captain; as a 
non-combatant, I insist — No, 



that would be hard to put over 
under the circumstances. How 
about; Well, fellows, the for- 
tunes of war, eh? Wonderful job 
you did at Stalingrad . 

“Maybe if you twiddle the 
knobs a bit, you can see some- 
thing of what’s going on out 
there,” Boyle suggested. Elton 
tried the controls beside the dark 
forward screen; suddenly it light- 
ened; a pitted surface of iodine- 
colored metal curved before 
them, sliding slowly past. 

“That’s better,” Boyle mutter- 
ed. “Don’t imagine the Reds had 
anything like that! Bloody vast 
thing, isn’t it?” 

“Bigger than anything we’ve 
got,” Elton said. “Alien looking, 
isn’t it? I wonder if Washingtcm 
knows about this?” 

“I should think Whitehall has 
likely let them in on it, sir.” 

4tT isten,” Elton said. “Do you 
— '• suppose that we somehow 
eluded their radar? After aH, 
we’re rather small, and they 
may have been expecting some- 
thing their own size.” 

“You may have something 
there, sir.” Boyle smacked his 
fist into his palm. “Hard lines 
we can’t activate this blasted 
pogo stick we’re sitting in.” 
“Look here, Lunar Computer,” 
Elton said. “Isn’t there a chance 
you can get us out of this spot 
we’re in? It appears — ”

“All systems now functional,” 
the voice said. 

“What! Why didn’t you say 
so!” 

“Data not requested,” the 
voice snapped. 

“Well, what about it. Can we 
jump away from here — get back 
where we started from?” 

“Yukk suppressors are acti- 
vated by high-velocity bodies 
moving within sensitivity range 
of instruments,” the voice said 
flatly. 

“Suppose we sneak away? Just 
sort of edge off-stage, so to 
speak?” 

“What about the Commies, 
sir?” Boyle remonstrated. “If 
you’re feeling a bit better now, 
we can renew the fight.” 

“Fight? Look here, Boyle, this 
has gone far enough. I must have 
been under the influence of al- 
cohol. What kind of fight can 
this — this wandering phone 
booth put up against that Levia- 
than? No, thank you. I’ll be 
happy just to get back, pay my 
fines, and leave quietly tomor- 
row aboard the S.S. Together- 
ness as planned — ” 

“Sir! Look there!” Boyle’s 
fingers dug into Elton’s arm; he 
pointed to the screen. In the sec- 
tion of the Yukk hull passing 
across the screen, a vast, gaping 
rent showed. Inside, Elton caught 
a glimpse of twisted structural 
members, buckled deck plates. 



“No wonder they paid us no 
heed!” Boyle blurted. “Looks a> 
though they had a spot of bother 
of their own.” A second vast 
wound in the immense hull drift- 
ed into view. Great, blackened 
tubes that could only have been 
weapons hung in their carriages, 
silent. 

“Crikey!” Boyle commented 
happily. “They’ve jolly well had 
it!” 

“They’re still active enough to 
deactivate our gruis, shut down 
our engines, and take us in tow,” 
Elton said. “The crew are prob- 
ably all in tiie imdamaged part, 
ready to blast us at the first sign 
of life.” 

Ct'fTT'hat about that, Looney 
Control?” Boyle barked. 

“It’s Lunar Control,” Elton put 
in. 

“Affirmative,” the voice said. 

“You see?” Elton said. 

“Are they on the lookout for 
us?” Boyle pressed on. 

“Negative.” 

“Why not?” Elton demanded. 

“There are no survivors aboard 
the Yukk ship,” the voice said 
casually. 

“No survivors?” Boyle and El- 
ton echoed together. 

“Then,” Elton said perplexed- 
ly, “who’s been operating the 
suppressor, and tractor rays, 
and—” 

“Yukk defensive armaments

activated automatically at the 
approach of possible hostile 
bodies.” 

“Now you tell us!” Elton sag- 
ged in his seat. “Well, Boyle, I 
think that lets us off the hook. 
We can go back now.” 

“I wouldn’t say so, sir,” Boyle 
cut in. “What about those chaps 
under siege? We can’t just go off 
and forget them.” 

“What siege? The Yukks have 
been wiped out. There’s no one 
here to besiege them!” 

“Perhaps they’re not aware of 
their victory, sir! We’ve got to 
carry the good news to them. It’ll 
be a feather in our cap, sir.” 

“I don’t care for feathery 
caps,” Elton said. “Let Lunar 
Control tell them, if it wants too 
— it seems to be damnably cagy 
when it comes to withholding in- 
formation.” 

“All you’ve got to do is ask 
the right question, sir.” Boyle’s 
voice was smug. “After all, it’s 
only a machine; admitted that 
itself. We’re the only personnel 
here — and I say we have a duty 
to perform.” 

“All right, all right.” Elton ad- 
dressed Lunar Control. “Can you 
take us there — to wherever this 
Lost Batallion is supposed to be 
pinned down?” 

“Station 92,” the voice said. 
“Affirmative.” 

“All right, I guess we’ll give 
it a try. But creep along slowly. 



so as not to wake any sleeping 
electronic dogs. Where is this 
station 92, anyway?” 

“On the surface of the moon 
Callisto.” 

IV 

ttTV yTiserable place to be ma- 
-Lr±rooned,” Elton said, star- 
ing at the bleak expanse of wan 
lit, cratered rock below. “Callisto 
is much too small to support an 
atmosphere, and at this distance 
from the sun I imagine the rock 
never warms much above abso- 
lute zero.” 

The ground was moving up 
swiftly; the screens swept the 
close ragged horizon, fixed on 
the black of the sky. There was 
a lurch, followed by a thump. 

“We’re down,” Boyle announc- 
ed. “All right, open up,” he call- 
ed. “And — ” 

“No!” Elton yelled — too late. 
The seat clamps snapped back, 
the doors slid open — and a 
breath of cool, perfumed air 
wafted in from outside. 

“It’s — but — how . ?” 
“Contact at station 92,” the 
voice said. “You are now within 
the defensive force dome.” 

“Oh, that explains it,” Elton 
let out the breath he had been 
holding. “The dome keeps the 
Yukks out, and holds the air and 
heat in.” 

“Now to spread the good 



172

word,” Boyle said heartily. 
“Ready, sir?” 

“I suppose you were right 
about coming over to let them 
know they’ve won.” Elton step- 
ped out, felt grass underfoot, 
sniffed the air. “My, won’t they 
be delighted.” He stared up at 
the heavens; Jupiter was a vast, 
pale crescent moon, glowing in 
banded pastel colors. Other, 
smaller moons moved visibly 
nearby. Vast numbers of fat, 
close stars glittered overhead. 

“I wonder where they are?” 
Elton squinted into the deep 
gloom of the Callistan night. 

“How many men have sur- 
vived?” Boyle called to the cap- 
sule. 

“Seven hundred and five in- 
dividuals now occupy the re- 
doubt,” the slightly bored-sound- 
ing voice said. “None of them 
are Men.” 

“Did you say,” Elton got out, 
“they’re not . men?” 

“Affirmative,” the voice was 
bland. 

“Blimey,” Boyle said. “A 
bunch of ruddy Martians?” 

“No wonder the Yukk ship 
looked alien,” Elton groaned. 
“This is some kind of inter- 
planetary war between intelligent 
oysters, or something. What are 
we doing mixed up in it?” 

“Questions relating to organic 
motivations are not within my 
scope,” the computer said. 



6t yi nd the Yukks aren’t Com- 
mies at all?” Boyle sound- 
ed disappointed. 

“Negative, in the sense in 
which you employ the terra; 
however, the Yukk practice a 
form of communal life, based 
on — ” 

“There you are, sir! Commies, 
as I said. These Reds are a 
crafty lot. As I see it, we British 
have made contact with the 
Martians, who’ve become our 
allies. It’s a group of their lads 
out here, and it’s our plain duty 
to carry on.” 

Elton scrambled back inside 
the capsule. “I don’t know about 
you, constable!” he called, “But 
I’m leaving.” 

“Warning,” the voice said. 
“Yukk batteries command entire 
volume of space within ten mil- 
lion miles. Any attempt to jump 
will result in approach to Yukk 
vessel and consequent concen- 
trated automatic Yukk fire with 
high negative probability of sur- 
vival of Mobile Command Cen- 
ter.” 

Elton scrambled back out <rf 
the capsule. “Dandy,” he said. 
“Marvelous. Rush to the assis- 
tance of our Martian allies, eh? 
Now look at the pickle you’ve 
gotten us in!” 

“Me, sir? Why, I’ve merely 
lent a hand — ” 

“All right! But here we are — 
wherever we are — sitting ducks 



WAR AGAINST THE YUKKS

for the Yukk — whatever they 
are.” 

“Yukks; some kind of Bolshe- 
viks, I don’t doubt. But it’s all 
the same to me. What we’ve got 
to do now, sir, we’ve got to make 
contact with our side and work 
out a plan of action.” 

“Never mind that,” Elton said. 
“We’ve got troubles of our own. 
There’s got to be some way to 
slip out from under the guns of 
that derelict.” 

“Not without first contacting 
these Martian chaps,” Boyle pro- 
tested. “We can take time to pro- 
pose a toast or two, exchange 
cigarettes, that sort of thing . .” 
Boyle’s voice faded. 

He stood, head cocked, listen- 
ing. 

“Do you hear anything, sir?” 
he whispered. 

“Only you, making another 
fatuous suggestion,” Elton re- 
plied tartly. “Personally, I favor 
asking questions of this mobile 
whatever-it-is until we get some 
useful answer, and then leaving 
as hastily as possible.” 

“There it is again sir!” Boyle 
said. 

“What?” 

There was a sudden quick pad- 
ding of feet, a loud whoosh!, a 
sharp chemical odor; Elton took 
a breath to shout, choked, felt 
the world swim out from under- 
neath and fall on him like a vast 
feather mattress. 



professor Elton moved to get 
away from an impleasant 
jogging sensation, discovered 
tight folds of coarse netting bind- 
ing his arms to his sides and 
holding his legs in a tight crouch- 
ed position. His left ear was 
pressing into the rough strands, 
and there was a sharp pain in 
his neck. 

“Help!” he croaked. “Boyle, 
where are you?” 

“Here, sir,” a weak voice came 
back. 

“What happened? I’m wrap- 
ped up like a mummy in some 
sort of seine.” 

“Same here, sir. We were took 
unawares, it appears.” 

“By your Martian friends, I 
suppose?” 

“Look on the bright side, sir. 
We haven’t been done in yet. 
That’s something.” 

They were in a dim-lit corri- 
dor, Elton saw. By twisting his 
head, he made out the silhou- 
ettes of slender biped figures 
with immense heads. He was, he 
saw, trussed in a net slung like 
a hammock from the shoulders 
of a pair of the creatures. 

There were shrill shouts from 
ahead, answering cries from his 
captors. More of the bipeds 
crowded around; Elton strained 
to get a clear view through the 
mesh, but carried as he was in 



174 



GALAXY 



e head-down position, he was 
unable to make out any more 
detail. 

There was an abrupt lurching 
as he was carried up a short 
flight of stairs. He squinted his 
eyes against the sudden, bril- 
liant light, then he oofed as the 
support dropped from under him, 
slamming him against a cool, 
hard floor. He pushed at the 
enveloping net, kicking it free 
of his feet, fighting it over his 
head. 

“Good Heavens!” Boyle’s voice 
burst out. 

“Hang on, Boyle! I’m com- 
ing!” Elton shouted encourag- 
ingly. He flung the net from him, 
whirled — 

“It said they weren’t men,” 
Boyle croaked. 

Standing in a semi-circle fac- 
ing the captives were six exceed- 
ingly pretty girls. 

“Rubavilup mockerump hif- 
swimp,” one of the girls said. 
Elton reached up dazedly to 
adjust his tie, his gaze glued to 
the large greenish eyes in the 
pert face before him. Below the 
face was a slender neck, adorned 
with multiple strands of tur- 
quiose-like beads. A close-fitting, 
short-skirted tunic hugged nicely 
curved hips; a pair of shapely 
legs leds Elton’s eyes to the 
polished floor, where they paus- 
ed for a moment, blinked, and 
started back up. 



tC'^hey’re not bad looking, 
sir,” Boyle said approv- 
ingly, “considering they’re Mar- 
tians.” 

The girl in the center of the 
group frowned. “Asibolimp hub- 
shut ook?” she asked Elton. 

“I’m terribly sorry, Miss,” he 
said. “I’m afraid I don’t under- 
stand.” 

“Here,” Boyle said loudly. 
“Who’s in charge here?” 

“Aridomop urramin ralafoo 
glip?” 

“Who’s . IN . CHARGE 
HERE . .?” Boyle repeated, 
with gestures. The girls spoke 
briefly among themselves. One 
pointed to a door across the 
room, then took Boyle’s arm, 
urged him on. He jerked free. 

“Look here, my girl — ” he 
started, shaking a finger under 
her nose. A sharp slap sent him 
back a step; his mouth opened 
and closed; then he reached for 
her. An instant later, having de- 
scribed a somersault over the 
girl’s shoulder, Boyle gazed up 
from a supine position on the 
floor. 

“Ralafoo glip,” the girl said, 
and jerked her head toward the 
door. 

“I think when she says ralafoo 
glip she means it; better do as 
she says,” Elton suggested, start- 
ing toward the indicated door. 

“All very well for you Yanks, 
you’re used to this sort of thing,” 



WAR AGAINST THE YUKKS

In the inner ro<»n, Elton fol- 
lowed gestures toward a massive 
chair placed against the wall, 
seated himself gingerly. Some- 
thing cool touched the sides of 
his face just in front of his ears, 
pressed firmly, “niere was a 
sharp prickling sensation. Ab- 
ruptly, his head seemed full with 
a screech like a tape recorder 
running backward at high speed. 
Elton flopped in the chair, caught 
by the head. As suddenly as it 
had begun, the screech ended; 
the clamps retracted. Elton 
stumbled to his feet. 

“What in the name of the Fall- 
en Towers of Hubilik was that?” 
he demanded, rubbing his ears. 

“The language indoctrinator,” 
the nearest girl said. 

“I don’t understand,” Elton 
stated, staring from the girl to 
the chair. “How in the name of 
the Five Sacred Snakes of Bo- 
makook did my sitting in that 
thing teach you to speak Grm- 
blkpsk?” 

“Umma oobabba ungha,” 
Boyle yelled incomprehensibly, 
pointing at Elton. Two girls 
seized his arms, thrust him to- 
ward the chair. He braced his 
feet, still shouting nonsense. El- 
ton savv? the bright metal clamps 
sv/ing down and grip the consta- 
ble’s head. They held him as he 
kicked out wildly, mouth open; 
then the chair released him. The 
girls stepped back. 



tt'VJow, if you’ll behave your- 
^ self,” the leading girl said 
to Boyle. 

“Calm yourself, Boyle,” El- 
ton snapped. “I’m sure your be- 
havior isn’t helping us.” He fac- 
ed the auburn-haired girl who 
had first spoken. 

“Now, young lady, if you’ll 
just let me explain: My name is 
Rflxk . .” he paused, frowning. 
“Rflxk? Is that my name?” 

“If you’re honest, you have 
nothing to worry about, dearies,” 
the auburn-haired girl said, tak- 
ing his arm in a firm grip and 
steering him back out into the 
hall. “Our detectors showed us 
something has passed through 
the screen. Naturally, we couldn’t 
afford to take any chances. After 
all, you could have been Yukks 
— just like we learned in Train- 
mg. 

“Us Yukks,” Elton managed 
a chuckle. “Why, my dear, we 
came here to assist you.” 

“Far lot of good it did us,” 
Boyle muttered behind him. 
“These bloody Amazons don’t 
want helping.” 

“Assist us how?” Elton’s au- 
burn-haired captor inquired, 
“Why, in the fight with the 
Yukks; but of course — ” 

“Ix-nay, ir-say,” Boyle said 
quickly. “One-day ell-tay em- 
they ut-way ee-way ound-fay.” 
“Well, back to the language 
indoctrinator,” a red-head said.

“That won’t be necessary,” El- 
ton said hastily. “My friend was 
just uh . reciting an old poem. 
By the way, where are we go- 
ing?” 

“A good luck spell? I hope it’s 
a good one — not that they 
work.” 

“You’re on your way to see the 
Mother.” 

“This is out of our jurisdic- 
tion,” another added. 

The girl holding Elton’s arm 
looked up at him with a reas- 
suring smile; her delicately 
curved lips were parted, showing 
even white teeth ; her hair looked 
as soft as angora; her lashes 
were long and dark. With an 
effort he kept his eyes from the 



warm, rounded shape poking 
against his arm. 

“We don’t often get visitors 
from the other domes,” she said 
“It’s kind of exciting, having 
you here.” 

“Why did you come?” an- 
other asked. “Is it about the 
fungus competition?” 

“Now Nid, the Mother will 
handle the interrogation.” 

VI 

'^■he two men followed their 
X escort along tihe high-vault- 
ed corridor, up more steps and 
under a filigreed arch into a 
wide room, where dim light from 
lamps placed at random among 



WAR AGAINST THE YUKKS 



177 



deep chairs glowed on small 
tables with bowls of exotic fruits, 
cushioned chaise lounges, and, at 
the center of the room, a foun- 
tain that leaped up to fall back 
into a shallow pool in which a 
vast, pale-white figure reclined. 

Two of the girls went forward, 
spoke briefly to the fat woman 
in the water. Elton could hear 
an answer in a hearty, police- 
matron voice; the girls twittered 
again, pointing toward the two 
strangers. 

“Let’s have a look at ’em,” 
the fat woman said. 

Elton and Boyle moved up to 
the pool edge, averted their eyes 
in embarrassment as the matron- 
ly figure, totally nude, reached 
out for a fruit bowl at poolside, 
selected a mango-like ovoid, took 
a large bite, chewed noisily. 

“All right,” the Mother said. 
“You did right, girls; they’re an 
odd-looking pair; look a little 
weather-beaten; not what you’d 
call beauties; but they’re not 
Yukks, that’s easy to see. You 
there — ” Elton knew she was 
talking to him. He faced her, 
arranging a faculty-type smile. 

“We haven’t seen strangers 
here in a long time,” the woman 
said. “Especially the kind that 
barge in without warning. Why 
didn’t your Mother call me? 
Never mind; good experience for 
the girls. Hearing about some- 
thing in Training is one thing. 



actually seeing it’s another. 
Now,” she took another bite of 
fruit. “You two girls just tell 
me in your own words what 
you’re doing here.” 

“What do you mean, you two 
oof!” Boyle subsided as Elton’s 
elbow caught him in the side. 
“Well, ah . .” Elton started. 
“I don’t believe I’ve seen your 
type before,” the Mother said. 
“Flat-chested, aren’t you? And 
narrow through the hips. You 
must have a hard time with your 
babies.” She shot Elton a sharp 
look. 

“Oh, ah, terrible,” Elton nod- 
ded. “Actually, I’ve never — ” 
“What dome is it you’re from?” 
“As a matter of fact, we came 
here from Shrulp,” Elton said. 
He blinked, trying the name 
again. “Shrulp?” 

“Here, sir,” Boyle put in. 
“Why not just teU them we’re 
from . Shrulp.” He looked 
puzzled. 

<4T’ve hear of Mumbulip 
J- Dome,” the Mother was 
saying. “And we had a delega- 
tion from Rilifub Dome in my 
Mother’s time, after a rock tre- 
mor knocked out one of their 
air plants. They had a terrible 
time of it, crossing Outside in 
one of those old Travelers, afraid 
it would break down any minute; 
but Shrulp — that’s a new one 
on me. Must be away over on 



178 



GALAXY 



Par Side.” The Mother frowned. 
“You’re not here to stir up trou- 
ble, I hope?” 

“Goodness, no,” Elton felt the 
smile slipping, twisted it back 
into position. “We understood 
that you needed help in the fight 
against the Yukks.” 

“Praise Mother,” the woman 
made a cryptic sign with her 
hands, which the girls standing 
in her line of vision copied. She 
frowned at Elton. “Where did 
you get the idea we don’t know 
how to deal with a Yukk?” 
“Frankly,” Elton ignored 
Boyle’s look, took the plunge; 
“The Lunar Battle Computer 
told us — ” he broke off, seeing 
the expression on the Mother’s 
face. 

“Look here, young lady,” the 
Mother snapped. “I’m as devout 
as the next person, but I won’t 
stand for any superstitious non- 
sense. Now, I think you’d better 
explain your invasion of my 
Dome — and don’t take me for 
a gullible old fool. I showed 
Mother Rilifub just how far 
she’d get trying to take the 
fimgus arrangement champion- 
ship away from us with her slick 
tricks.” 

“But it’s nothing like that.” 
“Not that I don’t respect the 
old ways, mind you. If it weren’t 
for you trouble-makers, the 
World would be a peaceful 
place — and Girl has her place 



in it. But I’m not standing by t0 
see charlatans get my girls all 
aroused. First thing you know, 
they’ll be openly advocating 
Strange Ways — ” 

A gasp ran through the assem- 
bled girls. The old woman ig- 
nored the reaction, signaled to a 
pair of handmaidens standing by. 
They stepped forward, gripped 
the fat arms of the Mother, and 
heaved her to her feet. She puff- 
ed, wading to shore. 

“Tikki, Nid,” she said to the 
attendant girls, “I’m tired. I’ll 
talk to these girls later; they’ve 
put me all on edge, and I want 
to be calm if it comes to a Judge- 
ment. Take them along and mind 
you keep them under close sur- 
veillance.” She accepted a vast 
huck towel, draped it across her 
shoulders, waddled to a chair. 

t4XTou’d better give them a 
blanket apiece and lock 
them in a storeroom,” she added. 
“You know how crowded we are 
for space . .” She shot a hard 
look past Elton at the girl Tikki. 
“Yes, I hardly know how we’re 
going to find room for them, 
with crowding the way it is. But 
we’ll manage somehow. Mean- 
while, I intend to check witii 
this Shrulp Dome wherever it is. 
If they’re here to spread Strange 
propaganda . .” She gave Elton 
a look which reminded him of a 
portly Dean of Women he had 



WAR AGAINST THE YUKKS

once known, who had suspected 
him of intent to impregnate her 
charges. 

“But we haven’t told you — ” 
Elton started. 

“Silence!” the fat woman snap- 
ped. “I’ll talk to you later. May- 
be tomorrow.” 

“See here, we came here to do 
you a good turn, and without 
even listening, you’re talking 
about locking us in storerooms.” 

“If they haven’t taught you 
proper respect for Mother at 
Shrulp Dome, you’ll learn it 
here!” The Mother said sharply. 
“Take them away, girls!” 

Back out in the corridor, El- 
ton cleared his throat and tried 
again. 

“Pardon me, but aren’t you 
girls concerned about the Yukk 
dreadnought out there, aiming its 
guns at you right now?” 

“You girls must be overly pre- 
occupied with theology over at 
Shrulp Dome,” the girl the 
Mother had called Tikki said. 
“Sure, we know all about the 
Yukks, but after all . .” she 
winked at Elton. “Nobody’s ever 
really seen one. So why should 
we worry?” 

“I don’t understand,” Elton 
said. “Here you are, right in the 
midst of a terrible battle with 
some sort of ghastly monsters 
with huge ships the size of moun- 
tains — and you don’t seem to 
care.” 



“If we’re good Girls, they can’t 
hurt us,” the girl dismissed the 
subject. “Listen, you seem like 
nice enough girls. The Mother 
said to lock you in a storeroom, 
but . maybe we could work 
something out.” She turned to 
speak in a low tone to the girl 
beside her. They turned into a 
side corridor lined on both sides 
with identical doors; it had a 
deserted air. Through a half- 
open door. Elton caught a 
glimpse of an empty room, dain- 
tily furnished in bright, flashing 
colors. 

“Look,” Tikki said. “I’ll tuck 
you in my room. Even though 
we’re awfully crowded, as the 
Mother said,” she added. “It 
won’t hurt if we double up, if 
you don’t mind sharing the bed. 
You must be simply worn out 
from the trip. I’ll bet it’s just 
awful outside the Dome,” she 
shuddered. 

“Sharing . your bed?” Elton 
asked. 

“It will just be for tonight. 
Your friend will go with Nid. 
Tomorrow one of the other girls 
will have you, and the night after 
that another.” 

Elton took a deep oreath. 
“Well, if you’re sure it won’t put 
you out?” 

“It’ll be fun,” the girl said. 
“We can just cuddle up and have 
a nice long talk. I want to hear 
all about Shrulp.”

I t was a small, neat room, with 
fluffy curtains at the window, 
a shaggy rug on the floor, a 
flounced spread on the bed, and 
a rack in one corner on which 
hung a dozen bright- colored 
short tunics. Elton’s hostess took 
off her turquoise beads and hung 
them on the rack, eyeing Elton’s 
battered bush jacket. 

“My, those are certainly 
strange-looking clothes you have 
on. I suppose you needed them 
for the trip, but you can get out 
of them now. I’ll draw us a tub. 
Would you like a little ginger in 
it, or maybe a touch of mint? I 
alv/ays like mint, myself.” 

“Tub?” Through an open door 
Elton saw a pink-tiled room, and 
tropical-looking flowers in plant- 
ers lining a ten-foot square simk- 
en pool with bright chrome fit- 
tings. 

“We can just relax and scrub 
each other’s backs,” Tikki said. 
She finished undoing the snaps 
down the back of her tunic, 
shucked it off, dropped it in a 
wall-slot, faced Elton wearing a 
diaphanous one-piece undergar- 
ment. 

Elton’s collar suddenly felt 
tight. He felt his face break into 
a silly smile, “Well, whatever 
you say . 

Tikki plucked a small box 
from a table, offered Elton what 



looked like a plastic cigarette. 
He groped, took one, jabbed it 
at his mouth. Tikki took one, 
drew on it, blew out perfumed 
smoke. “I’m afraid you bugged 
the Mother, with all that talk 
about the Yukks. She’s a dear, 
really, but very hard-headed 
when it comes to religion. She 
says it’s time we did away with 
outmoded concepts and recog- 
nized that the Yukks are merely 
an externalized personification at 
an inner yearning for defilement, 
or something.” 

“Look,” Elton said abruptly. 
“Let’s play a little game. We’ll 
pretend I just arrived from . 
from someplace so far away that 
I never even heard of the Yukks, 
or the Mother, or the domes — 
and you tell me all about it,” 
Elton said. 

“That sounds like a very 
strange game,” Tikki said doubt- 
fully. She opened the door to an 
adjoining room, stepped inside; 
a moment later a sound of rush- 
ing water started up. Steam 
wafted into the room, carrying a 
scent of Lifesavers. Tikki came 
back, holding a large cake at 
violet soap. 

“Is that what you play back 
at Shrulp?” 

“Yes, we spend a lot of time 
telling each other things we al- 
ready know. The trick it to catch 
the other . ah . girl in a 
mistake.”

it doesn’t really 
' ’ sound like much fun. If 
you feed like playing, wouldn’t 
you rather just wrestle? I’ll bet 
you know some interesting 
iMlds.” 

“Maybe later,” Elton gulped. 
“Now, you were going to tell me 
■11 about the Yukks, remember?” 

Tikki put a finger to her 
cheek, nibMed at her lower lip, 
looking thoughtfully at the ceil- 
Elton found the expression 
perfectly delightful. 

So was the slim, tanned body 
below it. 

“Well, nine hundred and sixty- 
four — or is it sixty-five . .? 
Let me see.” Tikki nibbled a 
finger tip. “It must be sixty- 
five because I finished Baby 
Training when I was ten, and 
Girl Training when I was eigh- 
teen, and it was sixty-one then, 
and that was four — ” 

“Sixty-five it is,” Elton put in. 
“You’re doing fine.” 

“Anyway, nine hundred and 
sixty-five cycles ago, when the 
war with the Yukks was in its 
nineteenth cycle, there was a 
great battle fought between two 
fleets. Now, in those days there 
were many among the Girls who 
were badly tainted with Strange 
Ways.” 

Her voice, Elton noticed, had 
taken on the tone of a pupil 
reciting lessons. “Because of this, 
the Girls weren’t able to destroy 



the wicked Yukks, as they de- 
served. Instead, the Great Moth- 
er sent a terrible thing called a 
Disrupter that caused the ma- 
chines of the Girls to malfunc- 
tion, and all of the Girls were 
killed or captured — except one 
shipload. The captain was a 
righteous Mother, and so she and 
her Girls were spared. They 
landed here on the World, and 
set up the Force Domes, and the 
defensive screens, to keep the 
Yukks at bay. That’s why it’s 
our duty to tend the Field Gen- 
erators, and defend Girlhood, 
and weed out any traces of . 
she blushed, “. Strange Ways. 
Not that anybody has any,” she 
added. 

“Any what?” Elton asked. 

“Strange Ways,” Tikki said 
primly. “You know.” 

“But we’re playing that I don’t 
know, remember?” 

“Here,” Tikki said reaching 
for Elton’s top jacket button. 
“I’ll help you get these things 
off. The tub’s ready by now.” 
The steam had formed a pinkish 
haze at eye level. “Is this what 
holds it?” She undid the button 
clumsily. “I’m not very good at 
this . .” She undid another but- 
ton. 

“What about the Yukks?” El- 
ton’s voice sounded strained. 
Tikki undid the last coat but- 
ton and pulled the garment off 
him.

the Yukks are evil 
’ ' beings who tried to en- 
alave all Girlhood, once, long ago, 
before we were driven out of the 
Heavenly Garden. They were 
great big ugly creatures, with 
hair growing all over their faces, 
and huge, bony hands — six of 
them, I think — and whenever 
they could catch a poor, defense- 
less Girl, they’d . Tikki swal- 
lowed, her face pink. “They’d do 
Strange Things to her.’’ 

“Strange Things?’’ Elton’s 
voice was a squeak. Tikki was 
just finishing the last shirt but- 
ton. She peeled it back over his 
shoulders. 

“And the terrible power they 
had was, that they made perfect- 
ly nice Girls want them to do 
the Strange Things. Even now, 
there’s always the danger that a 
Girl will fall into Strange Ways 
— like dreaming about a Yukk 
chasing her, with all six hands 
reaching for her — and even 
catching her . .” Tikki took a 
deep breath. “That’s what makes 
the Yukks so terrible, and that’s 
why if there really ARE any 
Yukks, and one of them ever 
managed to get into the Dome 
— ’’ Her eyes were flashing with 
anger; her nostrils flared. “Ev- 
eryone would tear the horrible 
hairy thing into tiny little pieces 
before he could spread any 
Strange Ways!” 

“Tiny little pieces?” Elton

stammered. He grabbed for his 
shirt, pulled it back on. Tikki’s 
eyes strayed to his chest. “My 
you ARE flat-chested,” she said, 
in an envious tone. She put a 
hand under each of her magnifi- 
cently formed mammaries, look- 
ed sadly down at them. “These 
DO get in the way . .” 

Elton was backing toward the 
door. “Ah . I’ve just remem- 
bered something,” he blurted, 
fumbling the door open. “Where 
did they take my friend? I have 
to find hi — her — right away!” 
“Oh. she’s just next door,” 
Tikki said. “But—” 

Elton whirled to the adjoining 
door, banged on it, twisted the 
knob. It flew open. Boyle, shirt- 
less, was just reaching for the 
tanned curve of his hostess’s hip. 
“No!” Elton shouted. 

Boyle yipped and jumped a 
foot into the air. 

“I’ve got to talk to you!” El- 
ton hissed, “privately!” 

“Look here, can’t it wait?” 
Boyle’s face had assumed a 
beefy color. “Bloody cheek, I call 
it, bursting in here just when I 
was about to ... to . make 
friends.” 

“That’s what I have to talk to 
you about.” Elton glanced at 
Boyle’s roommate, then at Tikki, 
standing in the doorway, looking 
puzzled. “Do you mind, girls? 
Just for a moment?” He ushered 
the girls out, closed the door. 



“I’ve made a discovery,” he 
started. 

“Me too,” Boyle said, smirk- 
ing. “I think we’re on to a good 
thing. A different one every 
night, at that. Now if you’d just 
toddle off, there’s a good lad — ” 

“Do you know what they do 
to Yukks if they catch one?” 
Elton cut in. 

“Tear ’em to bits, Nid said — 
that’s my young lady. They’ve 
no more use for bloody Reds 
than — ” 

“Correct,” Elton said. “They 
tear them to pieces. Small, hairy 
pieces.” 

“So what’s that to do with us?” 

“Plenty,” Elton said. “We’re 
Yukks.”

T)oyle was sitting on the bed, 
^ mopping at his face with a 
tiny lacy hanky he had found 
under the pillow. 

“That was a near thing,” he 
said. “Another five minutes — ” 

“And you’d have stood reveal- 
ed as the ancient arch-enemy of 
Girlhood,” Elton said decisively. 

“But look here, from what Nid 
said, they’ve been living here on 
this Tup’ny world for nine-hun- 
dred cycles, whatever those are.” 

“Nine hundred and sixty-five,” 
Elton corrected him. “I think the 
term probably refers to Jupiters 
revolutions around the sun. That

would be about . hmm . » 
eight thousand two hundred 
years, Shrulp time.” 

“Eight blinking thousand years? 
But that Looney Control affair 
said the crew had just stepped 
out.” 

“They did, too — about the 
time the ice was melting off Wis- 
consin. Probably ran into a party 
of early head-hunters or a wan- 
dering hyaenodon. I’m afraid Lu- 
nar Control has little or no 
awareness of the meaning of 
time.” 

Boyle shook his head. “Eight 
thousand years with no Yukks? 
Then how in the Six Rivers of 
Blue Mud do they have blinking 
babies?” 

“I’d imagine they have a sup- 
ply of frozen sperm — or possibly 
they’ve developed a method of 
parthenogenesis.” 

“How do you suppose this 
bloody system ever got started?” 
Boyle looked bewildered. “What 
this lot needs is a firm mascu- 
line hand to put things in order. 
I’ve a mind to — ” 

“To be tom to bits? Please, 
Boyle, this situation requires 
careful handling. We’ve got to 
get away from here — that much 
is clear. And there’s no time to 
lose. Sooner or later someone is 
going to put two and two to- 
gether.” 

“And it may as well be me,” 
Boyle said with sudden decision. 



*T.eave that Nid to me for a 
ni gh t or two and I fancy — ” 
“Strange Ways,” Elton said. 
“That’s what they call that sort 
of thing. I suppose it all started 
with some sort of idiotic feminist 
movement, somewhere. The 
women developed a method of 
reproducing without men, and 
declared their independence. 
Naturally, war followed; a war 
fought in space.” 

“Why space? And how? There 
weren’t any Ueeding space ves- 
sels eight thousand years ago.” 



< < A pparently tl 
matter of 



there were. As a 
fact, I did a 
paper once — but never mind 
that. Being women, the Girls 
wouldn’t want to do anything as 
untidy as fighting a war right 
there on Earth — and then too, 
I suppose the important logisti- 
cal targets were off-planet; cmi- 
trol of the spaceways was the 
key to success. And so a great 
battle was fought, and both sides 
virtually wiped each other out. 
The surviving Girls reached Cal- 
listo here, and set up these force 
domes and a defensive screen to 
keep off what was left of the 
Yukks; and the Yukks, with only 
one damaged ship left mount- 
ed a siege; then they died off — 
but the Girls never knew.” 

“I see . and back home, 
everybody made up and forgot 
the whole thing.” 



WAR AGAINST THE YUKKS

"JNot quite: there's still a cer- 
tain residual hostility. But the 
economic drain of the war and 
the loss of personnel plunged so- 
ciety back to a minimal cultural 
level — and we’re only now reat- 
taining their level of technology." 

“All right, granted you’re on 
tfie right track; what do we do 
now? Slip out of here and leg 
it back to the Mobile Whatsit?” 
“We don’t even know where it 
is — and anyway, the Yukks 
have us pinned down, remem- 
ber? The minute we come out 
from under the defensive screen, 
blooie!” 

Boyle chewed the inside of his 
cheek; a shrewd expression set- 
tled over his features. “They 
won’t shoot — not if we let them 
know we’re Yukks ourselves.” 
“Maybe,” Elton said, looking 
thoughtful. “We could give it a 
try, I suppose.” 

“No time like the present.” 
Boyle went to the door, opened 
it. Nid and Tikki came in, two 
slim creatures as imself-conscious 
as a pair of young antelope. 

“What arc you two girls talk- 
ing about in here?” Tikki asked. 

“I’ll bet you have some im- 
portant message from your 
Mother?” Nid hazarded. 

“As a matter of fact, we do,” 
Elton said. “Of course, this is 
a very confidential matter. You 
musn’t tell anybody.” 

“Not even Mother?” 



“We ten Mother everything,” 
Nid said. 

“Even about your — Strange 
Thoughts?” Elton hazarded. 

XT id and Tikki blushed a deli- 

' cate shade of purple. 

“We’ll have to confide in you 
ladies,” Boyle said solemnly. 
“We’ve got wind of a big push 
the Reds are planning. High 
Command is counting on us. We 
have to go back to our traveler.” 

“You mean — there really are 
Yukks?” Nid’s eyes were large 
with wonder. 

“Absolutely,” Elton nodded. 

“I ... I feel all sort of wiggly 
inside.” Tikki put her hands to 
her stomach. 

“Can’t you wait till in the 
morning?” Nid asked anxiously. 
“It’s only a month away.” 

“No, we have to go right now.” 

“Even before our bath?” 

“Definitely.” 

“You’re such brave girls,” Nid 
said admiringly. 

“I ... I can’t go,” Tikki said. 
“I’m afraid I might — ” Her lip 
quivered. “I might turn out to 
be — unreliable.” She burst into 
tears. 

“There, there,” Elton patted 
her shoulder, dismayed. “What’s 
there to be afraid of? You’ll be 
with us.” 

“You don’t know what an aw- 
ful Girl I am,” Tikki sniffled. 
“I have Strange Thoughts all the

time . and I’m afraid . 
might ... I might . disgrace 
Mother.” Her sobs took over. 
Nid took her hand. “Now, Tikki, 
you’re not the only one. I don’t 
know a Girl who doesn’t have 
a Strange Thought now and 
then.” 

“B-but I have them all the 
time . 

“I’ll tell you a secret: So do 
I; but—” 

“But I like them!” 

“Look, we’ll keep an eye on 
you,” Boyle said. “You’ll have 
to shut down that salt-water 
factory now, we’ve got to get 
cracking.” 

Tikki dabbed at her eyes and 
looked at Boyle resentfully. 

“Why, you’re the meanest 
Girl I ever met,” she said. 

Elton stepped up and put a 
protective arm around her. 

“Just leave Tikki alone, Boyle. 
Can’t you see she’s upset?” 

"Too right,” Boyle muttered. 
“Let’s be off, Nid me lass. No 
time to waste, you know. Moth- 
er’s orders and all that.” 

Nid opened the door and 
peeked out. “Coast is clear,” she 
said. “What about you, Tikki? 
Coming?” 

Tikki looked up at Elton. “I’ll 
go,” she said, still sniffling. “If 
youll promise to ... to watch 
me. 

“I won’t take my eyes off you.” 

“Good. I’ll feel safe then.” 




WAR AGAINST THE YUKKS 



She squeezed Elton’s hand. They 
stepped out and started off along 
the hall. 

^T'wenty minutes later, the 
foursome rounded a foun- 
tain tinkling in the dark, stum- 
bled past a six-foot hedge, saw 
the blue glow of the Mobile Com- 
mand Center ahead. 

Elton halted. “There aren’t 
any guards on it, I hope?” he 
whispered. 

“Of course not? Why should 
there be?” Tikki said aloud. 

“Shhh!” Elton cautioned. “This 
is a top secret mission, remem- 
ber.” 

They came up to the capsule 
sitting quietly, doors open, wait- 
ing. 

“Looks like everything’s ship- 
shape,” Boyle said. “Just like we 
left her.” 

Elton leaned close to him. 
“Stand by with the girls a few 
yards back. I’ll try to arrange a 
truce.” 

“Right,” Boyle moved to com- 
ply. Elton stepped into the 
cramped chamber, settled into 
tile seat. 

“Ah . look here, Lunar 
Computer. I’d like to contact the 
Yukk ship, get a message to 
their computer; whatever it is 
that controls the vessel. Is that 
possible?” 

“Messages can be transmitted 
m the Yukk wavelength.” 

188 



“All right; I want to tell them 
I’m taking off, and not to shoot. 
I want them to know we’re on 
their side. Tell them we’re 
Yukks, just like they are, and — ” 
“MAYDAY, MAYDAY,” the 
metallic voice screeched. “Yukks 
occupying Mobile Combat Com- 
mand Center Ten Ninety-four! 
Executing emergency procedure 
forty-one!” Elton’s seat lifted, 
dumping him out onto the grass. 
With a hiss and a sharp smack! 
the doors closed, snipping off the 
blue glow. There was an abrupt 
zing!, followed by a small thun- 
dercap. A gust of wind ruffled 
Elton’s hair. The capsule was 
gone. 

“Here!” Boyle yelled. “What 
do you think you’re doing?” 

Nid and Tikki stood staring. 
“It ... it went off and left 
us,” Elton said weakly. 

“Did I hear it say . Yukks?” 
Nid demanded. 

“W-where are they?” Tikki 
asked, looking around. 

“Now we’ve had it,” Boyle 
groaned. “Stranded, among these 
Yukk-eating females!” 

“What did you say?” Nid de- 
manded. 

“Never mind, my dear. You’ve 
been as nice a little friend as a 
girl could have. Now just run 
along and let me think.” 

“Hold on, Boyle,” Elton said, 
getting to his feet. “Don’t panic.” 
He turned to Tikki. “You girls 



GALAXY 



don’t happen to have another 
Traveler like ours — do you?” 
he asked hopefully. 

The girl shook her head. “I 
never saw one like that before.” 
“Do you have any kind of . 
of space vessel?” Elton said de- 
sperately. “Anything you can use 
to travel up there?” He jabbed 
a finger at the night sky. 

“We have one . Nid said 
doubtfully. “But—” 

“That’s all we need,” Boyle 
said promptly. “Just lead the 
way, there’s a good girl.” 

“Well . it’s a funny time to 
be going to church.” 

Distantly, Elton heard the 
shrill of a siren. Far away, some- 
one shouted. 

“Oh, dear,” Tikki said. “Some- 
one’s discovered you girls have 
gone out without permission. I’ll 
bet. Mother’s going to be up- 
set.” 

“Let’s just hurry along to the 
ship — quietly,” Elton urged. 
“After all, we can’t let anything 
interfere with the mission, can 
we?” 

“I think we’d better tell Moth- 
er,” Nid said doubtfully. 

“No time,” Boyle said. “Every 
minute counts. Mother will un- 
derstand, won’t she, professor?” 
“That’s what I’m afraid of. 
Let’s get going!” 

“This way,” Nid said, and slip- 
ped away into the shadows, the 
others at her heels. 



A vast, clumsy pyramidal 
shape loomed up, the base 
stretching away into darkness. 
Elton came up to it breathing 
hard, listening to the clang at 
bells, the shouts of Yukks and 
the shrill ululation of the siren. 

“They’re pretty well stirred 
up,” Boyle said. “How do you 
reckon we get inside this beast?” 

“Where’s the door, girls?” El- 
ton inquired, peering through 
the gloom. 

“Over here,” Nid called. At 
Elton’s side, Tikki shivered. “It’s 
scary,” she said. “I have the feel- 
ing the Yukks are right here be- 
side us.” 

Ahead, Boyle muttered a 
curse. “Watch that bottom step, 
professor: rotted through.” El- 
ton gave Tikki a hand up, follow- 
ed her up a short flight of crum- 
bling wooden steps; as he step- 
ped through the wide entry, hit 
shoes clanged on metal. 

“Where’s the bridge, or the 
cockpit, or whatever you call it?" 
Boyle asked in a hoarse whisper. 

“You mean the Mother’s 
Seat?” Nid asked. “This way . .” 

Elton and Boyle grunted and 
puffed, clambering up narrow 
companionways in the dark, 
banging their heads on low pas- 
sages, snorting dust from their 
nostrils. 

“Bit of rum odor about the 
place,” Boyle commented. 

“It reminds me of the smell

«f the Royal Chamber in Cheops’ 
pyramid,” Elton said. 

“Here we are,” Tikki said. 
“What are you going to do now?” 

There was a lAout from below, 
an answering call, then a mutter 
of conversation. 

“How do we close the entry 
port — the doorway?” Elton hiss- 
ed. 

“That’s this big handle over 
here,” Nid said. “Are you going 
to hold a Service now?” 

Elton grabbed the dimly seen 
lever, hauled it down. There was 
a growl of metal. Below, a heavy 
dang! cut off the voices. 

“Wish there was a bit of light 
here,” Boyle said. 

A wavering, yellowish illumi- 
nation sprang up. Tikki smil- 
ed from the panel, where scat- 
tered indicator lights glowed 
wanly. Elton went over, stared 
at the layout. 

“Tikki, do you understand all 
this?” 

“Oh, certainly; we had all this 
ki Training.” 

“How do you start the en- 
gines?” 

“Oh, goody; we’re going to 
have a Service.” Tikki turned to 
die panel, reeling off details of 
the countdown checklist. Boyle 
came over, holding a thick book 
in his hand. 

“Have a look at this, sir; the 
log, I imagine.” 



“Later,” Kton said. “You’d 
better give me a hand here, 
Boyle. This is pretty complicat- 
ed.” 

Boyle listened in silence for a 
moment. 

“Hold up there, Tikki,” he 
said. “Look here, professor, this 
is hopeless. It would take a rud- 
dy genius to gen up on this drill 
in the time we’ve got. You see 
what we have to do, don’t you?” 

Elton looked at him. Tikki had 
stopped her recital and was lis- 
tening, eyes wide. 

“You mean?” Elton said. 

“Right! They’ve got to go 
along. Couldn’t let them back 
outside anyway, without letting 
that lot down below in.” 

“But — that would be kidnap- 
ping.” 

“Tikki!” Nid’s voice came sud- 
denly, a shrill yelp. “Look!” 

Tikki jumped up. Nid rushed 
to her, thrust a faded and curled 
sheet of flexible plastic into her 
hand. Elton craned to see it. 

KNOW YOUR ENEMY! the 
heading read. Under the legend 
was a clear, glossy full-length 
photograph of a nude Yukk. 

Tikki looked from Elton to 
Boyle, back to the picture. “It 
. it looks . like the new 
girls,” she said in a quavering 
voice. 

“Just look at that flat chest,” 
Nid gasped. “And those skinny 
hips; and-and . .”

There was a heavy thumping 
from below. Boyle whirled to 
Nid. “Look here, love, there’s no 
time to give you the full story 
now; just get this machine going, 
there’s a good girl!” 

“We ... we really ought to 
go for help,” Nid quavered. 

“Start the ship up, Tikld,” 
Elton pleaded. “Even if we are 
Yukks, we’re not such monsters, 
are we now?” 

“But I don’t ... I mean, 
why — ?” 

“With that crew snapping at 
our heels, I should think it would 
be bloody obvious!” Boyle snap- 
ped. “You said you know how to 
operate this thing! Hop to it, 
or we’ve bought the ruddy farm!” 
“I’m a wicked, wicked Girl,” 
Tikki said weakly. “I’ll do it . .” 

Ohe went to the control panel, 
seated herself in the padded 
chair, punched buttons, closed 
switches; lights winked and glow- 
ed sluggishly; instrument needles 
stirred from pegs; there was a 
dry click! somewhere. Tikki got 
to her feet. 

“There,” she said. “But I just 
don’t see how you can think of 
ritual at a time like this — ” 
‘What ritual? We just want to 
depart as quickly as possible,” 
Elton reached for Tikki’s hand. 
“T hate to kidnap you like this, 
my dear, but — ” 

Tikki shivered and leaned 



against Elton. “I keep having the 
Strangest Thoughts . .” 

There was a final thump from 
below, a screech of reluctant 
hinges, then a babble of voices. 
Feet thumped on stair rungs. 

“They’re inside!” Elton urged 
Tikki toward the panel. “Quick!” 
A girl appeared at the con- 
trol room door; Boyle jumped 
at her, came staggering back as 
she stiff-armed him. More girls 
crowded into the room; a heavy- 
set fortyish woman pushed 
through, stood with hands on 
hips eyeing Elton and Boyle. 

“So you’re Yukks,” she said 
in a loud, deep voice. “You don’t 
look so tough to me!” 

Elton lunged for the panel, 
punched buttons at random. Two 
of the girls pulled him away. 

“A religious nut,” the deep- 
voiced woman barked. “Well, it’s 
too late for that, you! And any- 
way, you Yukks have no busi- 
ness desecrating the Church!” 
“Church? She said it was a 
ship,” Elton stammered. “The 
only one there was . .” 

Boyle groaned. “It just came 
to me,” he said. “No wonder 
nothing happened when Tikki 
twoddled the controls. This must 
be the ruddy vessel this lot 
came here in, eight thousand 
years ago.” 

“So the story goes,” the cap- 
tain said. “Now let’s get mov- 
ing, you two.” She shot Tikki

and Nid a hard look. “And 
there’ll be an investigation into 
the role you Girls played in this 
escapade, too.” 

“We ... we kidnapped them,” 
Elton said. 

“A likely story.” The woman 
jerked a thumb toward the 
frightened girls. “Put all four of 
them under guard and march 
’em back to the dorm. It looks 
like the Mother’s going to be 
sitting in Judgment tonight.”

'^he Mother was reclining in 
-*■ a heavily padded chaise 
lounge, with a box of pink and 
yellow candies at one elbow and 
a plate of cookies at the other. 
Heavy robes with elaborate 
flounces obscured her ample 
contours. She looked at Elton 
severely. 

“Lying to the Mother,” she 
said. “You ought to be ashamed, 
even if you are Yukks — and I 
never thought the Enemy would 
turn out to be so insignificant 
looking.” 

“They’re worse than they 
look,” the captain of the guard 
said. “You see the state they’ve 
got this pair of ninnies in,” she 
indicated Tikki and Nid, stand- 
ing by with drooping expressions. 

The Mother’s face tightened. 
“I thought from the first there 
was something Strange about 



them.” The assembled Girls — 
several hundred of them, Elton 
estimated, all ages, crowded into 
the wide Mother’s Room — sigh- 
ed in unison. 

“Silence in the courtroom!” 
the Mother snapped. “This is 
an open-and-shut case. These 
two are Yukks — that’s plain 
enough. They led a pair of for- 
merly decent Girls astray.” she 
eyed Tikki and Nid. “I’m going 
to let you two off lightly; cold 
baths every three hours for the 
next two days; that ought to 
cool those Strange Ideas off.” 
She turned back to Elton and 
Boyle. 

“As for you, there’s only one 
way to deal with a Yukk: it’s 
out in the Cold for you — ” 
The crowd of Girls gasped; a 
murmur ran through them. Tikki 
sprang forward. 

“That’s perfectly horrid!” she 
cried. “If they’re going out in 
the Cold, I’m going too!” Strong- 
arm girls jumped for her, drag- 
ged her back in line. Nid was 
sobbing quietly. Boyle shot her 
a sickly smile. “There, there, 
lass, don’t fret.” 

Elton cleared his throat. “Just 
a minute. Mother,” he said loud- 
ly. “Before you take this drastic 
step, I think there are a few 
things you should know.” 
“Whafs that? What could a 
Yukk have to say that would 
interest a Mother?”

Elton folded his arms, a calm, 
self-confident expression on his 
face. 

“If you’ll clear these others 
from the room,” he said easily, 
“I’d like to tell you the Facts 
of Life.” 

ITlton was lounging at ease in 
a deep-cushioned chair that 
was a twin to the one the Moth- 
er had occupied at the Judg- 
ment, eating large hot-house 
grapes that were being popped 
into his mouth one at a time 
by Tikki, while other Girls 
crowded close. 

Wide double doors opened 
across the room. Boyle appeared, 
shaved, his hair curled, a neat 
short tunic flapping at his thighs. 
A bevy of shapely Girls surged 
around him, all chattering at 
once. Two ran forward, scattered 
vari-colored cushions in a heap 
by the side of the wide pool set 
in the floor. 

“I’ve got to give you credit, 
professor,” he said. “You look 
like a blooming oriental poten- 
tate. How in the name of the 
Nine Gates of Ishalik did you 
do it?” 

Elton wrinkled his nose. “I 
think they overdid it a bit with 
the perfume, Boyle,” he said 
easily. “Otherwise you look well.” 

“The old bitch was ready to 
shove us outside the dome with- 
out even a set of ear-muffs,” 



Boyle stated. “We’d have frozen 
solid before we had a chance to 
asphyxiate. What did you say 
to her to rate us all this?” 
“Girls, leave us!” Elton said, 
waving a hand. “You can come 
back in a few minutes, dears.” 
They fled, casting longing 
glances back. 

“Well?” Boyle demanded. 
“Elementary, my dear Boyle. 
Surely you noticed the large 
number of rooms in the dormi- 
tory wings? Several hundred in 
our wing alone, and I saw at 
least a dozen wings — ” 

“Don’t talk ruddy architec- 
ture. Get to the point!” 

“This is the point. There are 
only seven hundred and four 
Girls here — and yet the build- 
ing was obviously designed for 
many more. And then there was 
the business of the Mother chat- 
tering about the crowded con- 
ditions; consigning us to a broom 
closet.” 

“That was just a bit of bloody 
cheek,” Boyle said. 

( ( XT o, it was important to her 
^ to give us the impression 
that the dome was overflowing 
with Girls; these domes don’t 
get along too well with each 
other, remember. She didn’t want 
strangers to find out her fighting 
strength had fallen so low.” 
“Well, if it’s low, it’s her own 
ruddy fault. I reckon she’s the

one that controls the birth-rate.’’ 
“Hmmm, yes — as far as she 
can. But did you notice, Boyle, 
that there are no children 
around? Tikki and Nid are about 
twenty-one; there’s quite a num- 
ber about the same age. The 
next grouping is at about the 
forty-five age level; the older 
generation, I suppose. Then there 
are a few old ladies who — ” 
“But there’s no new genera- 
tion, Boyle, and none of the girls 
are pregnant.” 

“So?” 

“They’ve been using an arti- 
ficial insemination method — us- 
ing frozen sperm cells, all of the 
x-x variety — thus only girls 
were born. But unfortunately, the 
supplies ran out twenty-odd 
years ago.” 

“Blimey! Then—” 

“Exactly. After eight thousand 
years, it was all over — until we 
came along.” 

“So now it’s up to us?” 
“Correct, Mr. Boyle. I sug- 
gest we work out some sort of 
equitable division. It should take 
us a year or so to work our way 
through, and then start over.” 
“Of course,” Boyle said doubt- 
fully, “It means we’re stranded.” 
“Not forever. I learned from 
the Mother that there are very 
extensive libraries here, well- 
equipped laboratories — ” 

“Hold it!” Boyle leaned on one 
elbow, looking worried. “These 



little ones we’ll be fathering: hatf 
of them will be little Yukks!” 
“Of course. Things will come 
back to normal in about twenty 
years — and by that time I think 
we’ll be ready to retire. We’ll set 
up schools, start training a new 
generation of technicians. They’ll 
be able to get the old ship going 
again — or build a new one. We 
can neutralize the Yukk ship, re- 
turn to Earth in style with 
enough technology to make us 
too rich to talk to.” Elton picked 
up a dusty book from the floor. 

tCT)ut, this is my greatest 
prize,” he said. “The log 
book from the ship. It gives an 
excellent picture of the pre-his- 
tory of human affairs on Earth 
from about 15,000 B.C. up until 
the war seven thousand years 
later.” 

“Twenty years, eh?” Boyle 
mused. “But look here, profes- 
sor; I just happened to think! 
All the old bag had to do was 
take a specimen from one of us 
— there’s millions of germ cells.” 
“But she didn’t know that, 
Boyle — so we’ll just let it be 
our little secret.” 

“I think you’ve hit on it, pro- 
fessor,” Boyle called. “Never tell 
’em all you know.” 

“Correct,” Elton said. “And in 
the meantime, we’ll deal with 
our problems . .one at a time.”

“We’re looking for people who 
want to write” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director. Famous Writers School: Former 
editor, Reader's Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing apti- 
tude. We'Il help you find out if you can 
be trained to become a successful writer. 

Three years ago, we started the Famous 
Writers School to help people who want 
to write acquire the skill and craftsman- 
ship it takes to break into print. Over 
many months, we poured everything we 
knew about writing into a new kind of 
professional training course, which you 
take at home and in your free time. The 
course begins with the fundamentals of 
good writing upon which every writing 
career must be built. Then you get ad- 
vanced training in the specialty of your 
choice — Fiction, Non-Fiction, Adver- 
tising or Business Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers. Your instruc- 
tor spends up to two hours analyzing 
your work. He blue-pencils corrections 



right on it — much as an editor does with 
established writers. Then he returns it to 
you with a long personal letter of advice 
and specific recommendations. 

Our School is young. Yet students, 
many still in Iraining, have sold their 
work to more than 101) publications. 

Wfilittt; Aptiittdc Tc.st oll'cred 

To find out if you too can benefit from 
this training, send for the School’s re- 
vealing Aptitude Test. If you test well, 
or offer other evidence of writing ability, 
you may enroll. However, there is no 
obligation to do so.
