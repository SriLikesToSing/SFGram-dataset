RESPONSE & ADDENDA 



T his is not the letter department — 
you’ll find that elsewhere (and 
just by the way, it certainly has im- 
proved, hasn’t it? One of these days 
we’ll be back in the golden age of 
controversy and provocation, and 
screeds by people who are obviously 
destined to. fill the rest of the book) 
— but from time to time something 
comes in which calls for more than 
the phrase of response which is all 
space allows back aft. 

For example, we owe some atten- 



tion to Mr. Ed Wegman, Promotion 
Manager for the UNESCO Publica- 
tions Center. In our last issue, we 
described with justified hysterical en- 
thusiasm the remarkable volume 
Source Book for Science Teachers, 
a handbook for the chewing-gum and 
string school of science buffs. We 
also went out of our way to be snide 
and cute about the lack of promo- 
tion for this shining gem of a book, 
since we had stumbled across it acci- 
dentally in a top company catalog

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today. 

THIS FREE BOOK 

The Rosicrucians (not a religious 



organization) an age-old brotherhood 
of learning, have preserved this secret 
wisdom in their archives for centu- 
ries. They now invite you to share the 
practical helpfulness of their teachings.

and by press time had been unable to 
find out who sells it in the U.S. And 
inevitably, the moment the article 
was set in type and beyond correc- 
tion, Mr. Wegman’s kind and cour- 
teous letter comes in with all the 
needed information. Know all by 
these presents then, that the Source 
Book can be had from Unesco Pub- 
lications Center, 801 Third Ave., 
New York 22. It’s $4 in hardcover, 
$3 in paper, and a hundred times 
worth a missed meal. 

Nothing we have done in these 
pages has sparked such a large and 
high-quality response as our recent 
piece on The American W ishhook, a 
discussion of the delights of catalogs. 
It “hit my sense of wonder squarely” 
said one respondent, which is almost 
as gratifying to an author of any- 
thing in a science-fiction magazine 
as a first acceptance. Now, company 
policy precludes our reporting prices 
or addresses in or of these catalogs, 
but we have answered each indivi- 
dual query, and in some cases, to 
save time (for these letters come 
from all over the world) have writ- 
ten ourselves to the companies, ask- 
ing that their wishbooks be sent to 
the reader. This is only one way of 
saying that your letters mean a great 
deal to us. 

We have asked that an exception 
be made to the publisher’s taboo on 
price reporting on these two items, 
because we regard them as genu- 
inely exciting news items. The Zuck- 
ermann harpsichord kit costs only 
$150 (plus your local lumber) and 
the Heath electronic organ kit goes 
for a mere $329.95 (less bench). 
Either one gives you an instrument 



you couldn’t get elsewhere without 
kicking hell out of a thousand-dollar 
bill. 

Ever use air letter sheets? You get 
them at the Post Office for 11c — a 
single sheet of lightweight paper, 
which folds up into envelope size and 
shape and is good for air postage 
to anywhere on earth. Well, many 
countries issue them, and one of the 
Wishbook letters came from New 
Zealand on an airletter sheet which 
bore a beautiful fourrcolor scenic 
print; we’ve never seen anything like 
it and suggest that some enterpris- 
ing American printer please copy. 

O ccasionally we get queries, rang- 
ing from genealogy (“Can you 
tell me where my name origin- 
ated?) through confessions of fugg- 
headedness (“I see by the May is- 
sue that you are to become editor of 
//. When?” — though what the May 
issue clearly reported was that Fred 
Pohl, and not yr. hmbl. svt., was 
editor of Worlds of Tomorrow) to 
questions of genuine interest to a 
good many of us. These are han- 
dled severally by ignoring them, by 
individual letters, or, as in this case, 
by asking you all, as: 

“Maybe you can help me. I sure 
would like a three dimensional co- 
ordinate system to which I can easi- 
ly fix points to create mathematical 
figures and engineering projects. It 
could be photographed and used to 
show students and persons without 
great orientation-perception, facts 
that might not be apparent from 
drawings.” 

Maybe you can help him?

THE GOVERNOR 
OF GLAVE 



BY KEITH LAUMER 



The revolution was over and 
peace restored — naturally 
Retief expected the worst! 



ILLUSTRATED 



I 

R elief turned back the gold-en- 
crusted scarlet cuff of the mess 
jacket of a First Secretary and Con- 
sul, gathered in the three eight-sided 
black dice, shook them by his right 
ear and sent them rattling across 
the floor to rebound from the bulk- 
head. 

“Thirteen’s the point,” the Power 
Section Chief called. ‘Ten he makes 
it!” 



BY GAUGHAN 



“Oh . Mr. Retief,” a strained 
voice called. Retief looked up. A tall 
thin youth in the black-trimmed 
gray of a Third Secretary flapped a 
sheet of paper from the edge of the 
circle surrounding the game. “The 
Ambassador’s compliments, sir, and 
will you join him and the staff in the 
conference room at once?” 

Retief rose and dusted his knees. 
“That’s all for now, boys,” he said. 
“I’ll take the rest of your money 
later.” He followed the junior dip-

lomat from the ward room, along 
the bare corridors of the crew level, 
past the glare panel reading 
NOTICE — FIRST CLASS ONLV 
BEYOND THIS POINT, through 
the chandeliered and draped ball- 
room and along a stretch of sound- 
less carpet to a heavy door bearing 
a placard with the legend CON- 
FERENCE IN SESSION. 

‘‘Ambassador Sternwheeler seemed 
quite upset, Mr. Retief,” the messen- 
ger said. 

“He usually is, Pete.” Retief took 
a cigar from his breast pocket. “Got 
a light?” 

The Third Secretary produced a 
permatch. “I don’t know why you 
smoke those things instead of dope 
sticks, Mr. Retief,” he said. “The 
Ambassador hates the smell.” 

Retief nodded. “I only smoke this 
kind at conferences. It makes for 
shorter sessions.” He stepped into 
the room. Ambassador Sternwheel- 
er eyed him down the length of the 
conference table. 

“Ah, Mr. Retief honors us with 
his presence. Do be seated, Retief.” 
He fingered a yellow Departmental 
despatch. Retief took a chair, puff- 
ing out a dense cloud of smoke. 

“As I have been explaining to the 
remainder of my staff for the past 
quarter-hour,” Stern wheeler rum- 
bled, “I’ve been the recipient of im- 
portant intelligence.” He blinked at 
Retief expectantly. Retief raised his 
eyebrows in polite inquiry. 

“It seems,” Sternwheeler went on, 
“that there has been a change in re- 
gime on Glave. A week ago, the 
government which invited the dis- 
patch of this mission — and to 



which weYe acca-edited — was over- 
thrown. The former ruling class has 
fled into exile. A popular workers’ 
and peasants’ junta has taken over.” 

“Mr. Ambassador,” Counsello 
Magnan broke in, rising. “I’d like to 
be the first — ” he glanced around 
the table — “or one of the first, any- 
way, to welcome the new govern- 
ment of Glave into tiie family of 
planetary ruling bodies — ” 

44Qit down, Magnan!” Stern- 

O wheeler snapped. “Of course 
the Corps always recognizes de facto 
sovereignty. The problem is merely 
one of acquainting ourselves with 
the policies of this new group — a 
sort of blue-collar coalition, it 
seems. In what position that leaves 
this Embassy I don’t yet know.” 

“I suppose this means we’ll spend 
the next month in a parking orbit,” 
Counsellor Magnan sighed. 

“Unfortunately,” S t e r nwheeler 
went on, “the entire affair has ap- 
parently been carried off without re- 
course to violence, leaving the Corps 
no excuse to move in — that is, it 
appears our assistance in restoring 
order will not be required.” 

“Glave was one of the old Con- 
tract Worlds,” Retief said. “What’s 
become of the Planetary Manager 
General and the technical staff? And 
how do the peasants and workers 
plan to operate the atmospheric pur- 
ification system, the Weather Con- 
trol station, the tide regulation com- 
plexes?” 

“I’m more concerned at present 
with the status of the Mission! Will 
we be welcomed by these peasants 
or peppered with buckshot?” 



THE GOVERNOR OF GLAVE

“You say that this is a popular 
junta, and that the former leaders 
have fled into exile,” Retief said. 
“May I ask the source?” 

“The despatch cites a ‘reliable 
Glavian source’ . ” 

“That’s officialese for something 
cribbed from a broadcast news tape. 
Presumably the Glavian news ser- 
vices are in the hands of the revol- 
ution. In that case — ” 

“Yes, yes, there is the possibility 
that the issue is yet in doubt. Of 
course we’ll have to exercise cau- 
tion in making our approach. It 
wouldn’t do to make overtures to 
the wrong side.” 

“Oh, I think we need have no fear 
on that score,” the Chief of the Po- 
litical Section spoke up. “I know 
these entrenched cliques. Once chal- 
lenged by an aroused populace, they 
scuttle for safety — with large bal- 
ances safely tucked away in neutral 
banks.” 

“I’d like to go on record,” Mag- 
nan piped, “as registering my deep 
gratification at this fulfillment of 
popular aspirations — ” 

“The most popular aspiration I 
know of is to live high off someone 
else’s effort,” Retief said. “I don’t 
know of anyone outside the Corps 
who’s managed it.” 

4 C /Gentlemen!” Sternwheeler bel- 
Vj lowed. “I’m awaiting your 
coqstructive suggestions — not an ex- 
change of political views. We’ll ar- 
rive off Glave in less than six hours. 
I should like before that time to 
have developed some notion regard- 
ing to whom I shall expect to offer 
my credentials!” 



There was a discreet tap at the 
door; it opened and the young Third 
Secretary poked his head in. 

“Mr. Ambassador, I have a reply 
to your message — just received 
from Glave. It’s signed by the Stew- 
ard of the GFE, and I thought you’d 
want to see it at once . .” 

“Yes, of course; let me have it.” 

“What’s the GFE?” someone 
asked. 

“It’s the revolutionary group,” the 
messenger said, passing the message 
over. 

“GFE? GFE? What do the letters 
SIGNIFY?” 

“Glorious Fun Eternally,” Retief 
suggested. “Or possibly Goodies For 
Everybody.” 

“I believe that’s ‘Glavian Free 
Electorate’,” the Third Secretary 
said. 

Sternwheeler stared at the paper, 
lips pursed. His face grew pink. He 
slammed the paper on the table. 

“Well, gentlemen! It appears our 
worst fears have been realized! This 
is nothing less than a warning! A 
threat! We’re advised to divert 
course and bypass Glave entirely. It 
seems the GFE wants no interfer- 
ence from meddling foreign exploit- 
ers, as they put it!” 

Magnan rose. “If you’ll excuse me 
Mr. Ambassador, I want to get off 
a message to Sector HQ to hold my 
old job for me — ” 

“Sit down, you idiot!” Stern- 
wheeler roared. “If you think I’m 
consenting to have my career blight- 
ed — my first Ambassadorial post 
whisked out from under me — the 
Corps made a fool of — ” 

“I’d like to take a look at that

message,” Relief said. It was passed 
along to him. He read it. 

don’t believe this applies to us, 
Mr. Ambassador.” 

44TT|^hat are you talking about? 

▼ ▼ It’s addressed to me by 
name!” 

“It merely states that ‘meddling 
foreign exploiters’ are unwelcome. 
Meddling foreigners we are, but we 
don’t qualify as exploiters unless we 
show a profit — and this appears to 
be shaping up as a particularly prof- 
itless venture.” 

“What are you proposing, Mr. 
Retief?” 

“That we proceed to make plan- 
etfall as scheduled, greet our wel- 
coming committee with wide diplo- 
matic smiles, hint at largesse in the 
offing and settle down to observe the 
lie of the land.” 

“Just what I was about to sug- 
gest,” Magnan said. 

“That might be dangerous,” Stern- 
wheeler said. 

“That’s why I didn’t suggest it,” 
Magnan said. 

“Still it’s essential that we learn 
more of the situation than can be 
gleaned from official broadcasts,” 
Sternwheeler mused. “Now, while I 
can’t justify risking the entire Mis- 
sion, it might be advisable to dis- 
patch a delegation to sound out the 
new regime.” 

“I’d like to volunteer,” Magnan 
said, rising. 

“Of course, the delegates may be 
murdered — ” 

“ — but unfortunately. I’m under 
treatment at the moment.” Magnan 
sat down. 



•* — which will place us in an ex- 
cellent position, propaganda-wise. 

“What a pity I can’t go,” the Mil- 
itary Attache said. “But my place is 
with my troops.” 

“The only troops you’ve got are 
the Assistant Attache and your sec- 
retary,” Magnan pointed out. ^ 
“Say, I’d like to be down there in 
the thick of things,” the Political Of- 
ficer said. He assumed a grave ex- 
pression. “But of course I’ll be need- 
ed here, to interpret results.” 

“I appreciate your attitude, gen- 
tlemen,” Sternwheeler said, studying 
the ceiling. “But I’m afraid I must 
limit the privilege of volunteering 
for this hazardous duty to those of- 
ficers of more robust physique, un- 
der forty years of age — ” 

“Tsk. I’m forty-one,” Magnan 
said. 

“ — and with a reputation for 
adaptability.” His glance moved 
along the table. 

“Do you mind if I run along now, 
Mr. Ambassador?” Retief said. It’s 
time for my insulin shot.” 

Sternwheeler’s mouth dropped 
open. 

“Just kidding,” Retief said.” “I’ll 
go. But I have one request, Mr. Am- 
bassador: no further communication 
with the ground until I give the all- 
clear.” 

II 

R etief grounded the lighter, in- 
cycled the lock and stepped out. 
The hot yellow Glavian sun beat 
down on a broad expanse of con- 
crete, an abandoned service cart 
and a row of tall ships casting black

shadows toward the sflent control 
tower. A wisp of smoke curled up 
from the shed area at the rim of 
the field. There was no other sign 
of life. 

Retief walked over to the cart, 
tossed his valise aboard, climbed in- 
to the driver’s seat and headed for 
the operations building. Beyond the 
port, hills rose, white buildings 
gleaming against the deep green 
slopes. Near the ridge, a vehicle 
moved ant-like along a winding 
road, a dust trail rising behind it. 
Faintly a distant shot sounded. 

Papers littered the ground before 
the Operations Building. Retief 
pushed open the tall glass door, 
stood listening. Slanting sunlight re- 
flected from a wide polished floor, 
at the far side of which illuminated 
lettering over empty counters read 
IMMIGRATION, HEALTH and 
CUSTOMS. He crossed to the desk, 
put the valise down, then leaned 
across the counter. A worried face 
under an oversized white cap looked 
up at him. 

‘‘You can come out now,” Retief 
said. “They’ve gone.” 

The man rose, dusting himself 
off. He looked over Retief’s shoul- 
der. “Who’s gone?” 

“Whoever it was that scared you.” 

“Whatta ya mean? I was looking 
for my pencil.” 

“Here *it is.” Retief plucked a 
worn stub from the pocket of the 
soiled shirt sagging under the weight 
of braided shoulderboards. “You can 
sign me in as a Diplomatic Repre- 
sentative. A break for you — no 
formalities necessary. Where can I 
catch a cab for the city?” 



The man eyed Retiefs bag. 
“What’s in that?” 

“Personal belongings under duty- 
free entry.” 

“Guns?” 

“No, thanks, just a cab.” 

“You got no gun? The man raised 
his voice. 

“That’s right, fellows,” Retief 
called out. “No gun; no knife, not 
even a small fission bomb. Just a 
few pairs of socks and some reading 
matter.” 

A brown-uniformed man ran 
from behind the Customs Counter, 
holding a long-barreled blast-rifle 
centered on the Corps insignia 
stitched to the pocket of Retief’s 
powder-blue blazer. 

“Don’t try nothing,” he said. 
“You’re under arrest.” 

“It can’t be overtime parking. I’ve 
only been here five minutes.” 
“Hah!” The gun-handler moved 
out from the counter, came up to 
Retief. “Empty out your pockets!” 
he barked. “Hands overhead!” 

“I’m just a diplomat, not a con- 
tortionist,” Retief said, not moving. 
“Do you mind pointing that thing 
in some other direction?” 

“Looky here. Mister, I’ll give the 
orders. We don’t need anybody tell- 
ing us how to run our business.” 
“I’m telling you to shift that blast- 
er before I take it away from you 
and wrap it around your neck,” Ret- 
ief said conversationally. The cop 
stepped back uncertainly, lowering 
the gun. 

“Jake! Horny! Pud! come on 
out!” 

Three more brown uniforms 
emerged from concealment.

IF 




‘‘Who are you fellows hiding from, 
the top sergeant?” Retief glanced 
over the ill-fitting uniforms, the un- 
shaved faces, the scuffed boots. 
“Tell you what. When he shows up, 
I’ll engage him in conversation. You 
beat it back to the barracks and 
grab a quick bath — ” 

“That’s enough smart talk.” The 
biggest of the three newcomers 
moved up to Retief. “You stuck your 
nose in at the wrong time. We just 
had a change of management around 
here.” 

“I heard about it,” Retief said. 
“Who do I complain to?” 

“Complain? What about?” 

“The port’s a mess,” Retief 
barked. “Nobody on duty to receive 
official visitors! No passenger ser- 
vice facilities! Why, do you know I 
had to carry my own bag — ” 

“All right, all right, that’s outside 
my department. You better see the 
boss.” 

“The boss? I thought you got rid 
of the bosses.” 

“We did, but now we got new 
ones.” 

“They any better than the old 
ones?” 

“This guy asks too many ques- 
tions,” the man with the gun said. 
“Let’s let Sozier answer ’em.” 

“Who’s he?” 

“He’s the Military Governor of 
the City.” 

“Now we’re getting somewhere,” 
Retief said. “Lead the way, Jake — 
and don’t forget my bag.” 

S ozier was a small man with 
thin hair oiled across a shiny 
scalp, prominent ears and eyes like 



coal chips set in rolls of fat. He 
glowered at Retief from behind a 
polished desk occupying the center 
of a spacious office. 

“I warned you off,” he snapped. 
“You came anyway.” He leaned for- 
ward and slammed a fist down on 
the desk. “You’re used to throwing 
your weight around, hut you won’t 
throw it around here! There’ll be no 
spies pussyfooting around Glave!” 
“Looking for what, Mr. So- 
zier?” 

“Call me General!” 

“Mind if I sit down?” Retief pulld 
out a chair, seated himself and took 
out a cigar. “Curiously enough,” he 
Said, lighting up, “the Corps has no 
intention of making any embarras- 
sing investigations. We deal with 
the existing government, no ques- 
tions asked.” His eyes held the oth- 
er’s. “Unless, of course, there are 
evidences of atrocities or other il- 
legal measures.” 

The coal-chip eyes narrowed. “I 
don’t have to make explanations to 
you or anybody else.” 

“Except, presumably, the Glavian 
Free Electorate,” Retief said bland- 
ly. “But tell me, General — who’s 
actually running the show?” 

A speaker on the desk buzzed. 
“Hey, Corporal Sozier! Wes’s got 
them two hellions cornered. They’re 
holed up in the Birthday Cake — ” 
“General Sozier, damn you! and 
plaster your big mouth shut!” He 
gestured to one of the uniformed 
men standing by. 

“You! Get Trundy and Little Moe 
up here — pronto!” He swiveled 
back to Retief. “You’re in luck. I’m 
too busy right now to bother with

you. You get back over to the port 
and leave the same way you came 
— and tell your blood-sucking 
friends the easy pickings are over 
as far as Glave’s concerned. You 
won’t lounge around here living 
high and throwing big parties and 
cooking up your dirty deals to get 
fat on at the expense of the working 
man.” 

Retief dribbled ash on Sozier’s 
desk and glanced at the green uni- 
form front bulging between silver 
buttons. 

“Who paid for your potbelly, So- 
zier?” he inquired carelessly. 

Sozier’s eyes narrowed to slits. “I 
could have you shot!” 

“Stop playing games with me, So- 
zier,” Retief rapped. “There’s a 
squadron of Peace Enforcers stand- 
ing by just in case any apprentice 
statesmen forget the niceties of dip- 
lomatic usage. I suggest you start 
showing a little intelligence about 
now, or even Horny and Pud are 
likely to notice.” 

S ozier’s fingers squeaked on the 
arms of his chair. He swai- 
lowed. 

“You might start by assigning me 
an escort for a conducted tour of 
the capital,” Retief went on. “I want 
to be in a position to confirm that 
order has* been restablished, and 
that normal services have been re- 
stored. Otherwise it may be neces- 
sary to send in a Monitor Unit to 
straighten things out ” 

“You know you can’t meddle with 
the internal affairs of a sovereign 
world!” 

Retief sighed. “The trouble with 



taking over your boss’s job is dis- 
covering its drawbacks. It’s disillus- 
ioning, I know, Sozier, but — ” 

“All right! Take your tour! You’ll 
find everything running as smooth 
as silk! Utilities, police, transport, 
environmental control — ” 

“W hat about Space Control? 
Glave Tower seems to be off the 
air.” 

“I shut it down. We don’t need 
anything and we don’t want any- 
thing from the outside.^’ 

“Where’s the new Premier keep- 
ing himself? Does he share your 
passion for privacy?” 

Tfee general got to his feet. “I’m 
letting you take your look, Mr. Big 
Nose. I’m giving you four hours. 
Then out! And the next meddling 
bureaucrat that tries to cut atmos- 
phere on Glave without a clearance 
gets burned!” 

“I’ll need a car.” 

“Jake! You stick close to this bird 
Take him to the main power plant, 
the water works and the dispatch 
center. Ride him around town and 
show him we’re doing okay without 
a bunch of leeches bossing us. Then 
dump him at the port — and see 
that he leaves.” 

“I’ll plan my own itinerary, thanks- 
I can’t promise I’ll be finished in 
four hours — but I’ll keep you ad- 
vised.” 

“I warned you — ” 

“I heard you. Five times. And I 
only warned you once. You’re get- 
ting ahead of me.” Retief rose, mo- 
tioned to the hulking guard. “Come 
on, Jake. We’ve got a lot of ground 
to cover before we come back for 
our dinner.

A t the curb, Retief held out 
his hand. “Give me the power 
cylinder out of your rifle, Jake.” 
“Huh?” 

“Come on, Jake. You’ve got a 
nervous habit of playing with the 
firing stud. We don’t want any acci- 
dents.” 

“How do you get it out? They 
only give me this thing yesterday.” 
Retief pocketed the cylinder. “You 
sit in back. I’ll drive.” He wheeled 
the car off along a broad avenue 
crowded with vehicles and lined with 
flowering palms, behind which state- 
ly white buildings reared up into the 
pale sky. 

“Nice looking city, Jake,” Retief 
said conversationally. “What’s the 
population?” « 

“I dunno. I only been here a year.” 
“What about Horny and Pud? 
Are they natives?” 

“Whatta ya mean, natives? 
They’re just as civilized as me.” 
“My boner, Jake. Known Sozier 
long?” 

“Sure. He useta come around to 
the club.” 

“I take it he was in the army un- 
der the old regime?” 

“Yeah' — but he didn’t like the 
way they run it. Nothing but band 
playing and fancy marching. There 
wasn’t nobody to fight.” 

“Just between us, Jake — where 
did the former Planetary Manager 
General go?” Retief watched Jake’s 
heavy face in the mirror. Jake 
jumped, clamped his mouth shut. 

“I don’t know nothing.” 

Half an hour later, after a tour 



of the commercial center, Retief 
headed towards the city’s outskirts. 
The avenue curved, leading up along 
the flank of a low hill. 

“1 must admit I’m surprised, 
Jake,” Retief said. “Everything seems 
orderly No signs of riots or panic. 
Power, water, communications nor- 
mal — just as the general said. Re- 
markable, isn’t it, considering that 
the entire managerial class has 
packed up and left?” 

“You wanta see the Power Plant?” 
Retief could see perspiration beaded 
on the man’s forehead under the 
uniform cap. 

“Sure. Which way?” With Jake 
directing, Retief ascended to the 
ridge top, cruised past the blank 
white facade of the station. 

“Quiet, isn’t it?” Retief pulled the 
car in to the curb. “Let’s go inside.” 

“Huh? Corporal Sozier didn’t say 
nothing — ” 

“You’re right, Jake. That leaves it 
to our discretion.” 

“He won’t like it.” 

“The corporal’s a busy man, Jake. 
We won’t worry him by telling him 
about it.” 

Jake followed Retief up the walk. 
The broad double doors were locked. 
“Let’s try the back.” 

The narrow door set in the high 
blank wall opened as Retief ap- 
proached. A gun barrel poked out, 
followed by a small man with bushy 
red hair. He looked Retief over. 

“Who’s this party, Jake?” he 
barked. 

“Sozier said show him the plant,” 
Jake said. 

“What we need is more guys to 
pull duty, not tourists. Anyway, Fm

Chief Engineer here. Nobody comes 
in here ‘less I like their looks.” Rel- 
ief moved forward, stood looking 
down at the redhead. The little man 
hesitated, then waved him past. 
“Lucky for you I like your looks.” 
Inside, Relief surveyed the long 
room, the giant converter units, the 
massive busbars. Armed men — 
some in uniform, some in work 
clothes or loud sport shirts — stood 
here and there. Other men read me- 
ters, adjusted controls or inspected 
dials. 

“You’ve got more guards than 
workers,” Relief said. “Expecting 
trouble?” 

The redhead bit the corner from 
a plug of spearmint. He glanced 
around the plant. “Things is quiet 
now; but you never know.” 

“Rather old - fashioned equipment 
isn’t it? When was it installed?” 
“Huh? I dunno. What’s wrong 
with it?” 

“What’s your basic power source, 
a core sink? Lithospheric friction? 
Sub-crustal hydralics?” 

“Beats me. Mister. I’m the boss 
here, not a dern mechanic.” 

A gray-haired man carrying a 
clipboard walked past, studied 
a panel, made notes, glanced up to 
catch Relief’s eye, moved on. 

“Everything seems to be running 
normally,” ‘Relief remarked. 

“Sure. Why not?” 

“Records being kept up proper- 
ly?” 

“Sure. Some of these guys, all 
they do is walk around looking at 
dials and writing stuff on . paper. If 
it was me, I’d pul ’em to work.” 



Relief strolled over to the gray- 
haired man, now scribbling before a 
bank of meters. He glanced at the 
clipboard. 

Power off at sunset. Tell Corasol 
was scrawled in block letters across 
the record sheet. Relief nodded, re- 
joined his guard 

“All right, Jake. Let’s have a look 
at the communications center.” 

Back in the car, headed west. Rel- 
ief studied the blank windows of of- 
fice buildings, the milling throngs in 
beer bars, shooting galleries, tattoo 
parlors, billiard halls, pinball ar- 
cades, bordellos and half-credit cas- 
inos. 

“Everybody seems to be having 
fun,” he remarked. 

Jake starea out the window. 
“Yeah.” 

“Too bad you’re on duty, Jake. 
You could be out there joining in.” 
“Soon as the corporal gets things 
organized. I’m opening me up a 
place to show dirty tri-di’s. I’ll get 
my share.” 

“Meanwhile, let the rest of ’em 
have their fun, eh Jake?” 

“Look, Mister, I been thinking. 
Maybe you better gimme back that 
kick-stick you taken outa my gun...” 
“Sorry, Jake; no can do. Tell me, 
what was the real cause of the rev- 
olution? Not enough to eat? Too 
much regimentation?” 

“Naw, we always got plenty to 
eat. There wasn’t none of that reg- 
imentation up til! I joined up in the 
corporal’s army.” 

“Rigid class structure, maybe? Ed- 
ucational discrimination?” 

Jake nodded. “Yeah, it was them 
schools done it. All the time trying

to make a feller to some kind of 
class. Big shots. Know it all. Gonna 
make us sit around and view tapes. 
Figgered they was better than us.” 
'‘And Sozier’s idea was you’d take 
over, and you wouldn’t have to be 
bothered.” 

“Aw, it wasn’t Sozier’s idea. He 
ain’t the big leader.” 

“^here does the big leader keep 
himself?” 

“I dunno. I guess he’s pretty busy 
right now.” Jake snickered. “Some of 
them guys call themselves colonels 
turned out not to know nothing 
about how to shoot off the guns.” 
“Shooting, eh? I thought it was a 
sort of peaceful revolution. The 
managerial class were booted out, 
and that was that.” 

“I don’t know nothing,” Jake 
snapped. “How come you keep try- 
ing to get me to say stuff I ain’t 
supposed to talk about? You want to 
get me in trouble?” 

4t/^h, you’re already in trouble, 
Jake. But if you stick with 
me. I’ll try to get you out of it. 
Where exactly did the refugees head 
for? How did they leave? Must have 
been a lot of them; I’d say in a city 
of this size alone, they’d run into the 
thousands.” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Of course, it depends on your 
definition of a big shot. Who’s in- 
cluded in that category, Jake?” 

“You know, the slick-talking ones; 
the fancy dressers; the guys that 
walk around and tell other guys 
what to do. We do all the work and 
they get all the big pay.” 

“I suppose that would cover sci- 



entists, professional men, executives, 
technicians of all sorts, engineers, 
teachers — all that crowd.” 

“Yeah, them are the ones.” 

“And once you got them out of 
the way, the regular fellows would 
have a chance. Chaps that don’t 
spend all their time taking baths and 
reading books and using big words; 
good Joes that don’t mind picking 
their noses in public.” 

“We got as much right as any- 
body — ” 

“Jake, who’s Corasol?” 

“He’s — I don’t know.” 

“I thought I overheard his name 
somewhere.” 

“Uh, here’s the communication 
center,” Jake cut in. 

Retief swung into a parking lot 
under a high blank facade. He set 
the brake and stepped out. 

“Lead the way, Jake.” 

“Look, Mister, the corporal only 
wanted me to show you the outside.” 
“Anything to hide, Jake?” 

Jake shook his head angrily and 
stamped past Retief. “When I joined 
up with Sozier, I didn’t figger I’d be 
getting in this kind of mess.” 

“I know, Jake. It’s tough. Some- 
times it seems like a fellow works 
harder after he’s thrown out the 
parasites then he did before.” 

A cautious guard let Retief and 
Jake inside, followed them along 
bright-lit aisles among consoles, ca- 
bles, batteries of instruments. Armed 
men in careless uniforms lounged, 
watching. Here and there a silent 
technician worked quietly. 

Retief paused by one, an elderly 
man in a neat white coverall, with 
a purple spot under one eye.

“Quite a bruise you’ve got there,” 
Retief commented heartily. “Power 
failure at sunset,” he added softly. 
The technician hesitated, nodded 
and moved on. 

Back in the car, Retief gave Jake 
directions. At the end of three hours, 
he had seen twelve smooth-running, 
heavily guarded installations. 

“So far, so good, Jake,” he said. 
“Next stop, Sub-station Number 
Nine.” In the mirror, Jake’s face 
stiffened. “Hey, you can’t go down 
there — ” 

“Something going on there, Jake?” 

“That’s where — 1 mean, no. I 
don’t know.” 

“I don’t want to miss anything, 
Jake. Which way?” 

“I ain’t going down there,” Jake 
said sullenly. 

Retief braked. “In that case. I’m 
afraid our association is at an end, 
Jake.” 

“You mean . you’re getting out 
here?” 

“No, you are.” 

“Huh? Now wait a minute, Mis- 
ter! The corporal said I was to stay 
with you.” 

Retief accelerated. “That’s settled, 
then. Which way?” 

IV 

R etief pulled the car to a halt 
two hundred yards from the 
periphery of a loose crowd of brown- 
uniformed men who stood in groups 
scattered across a broad plaza, over- 
flowing into a stretch of manicured 
lawn before the b:^re. functional fa- 
cade of suh-viatioFKnumbcr Nine. In 
the midst ot the besieging mob, So- 



zier’s red face and bald head bobbed 
as he harangued a cluster of green- 
uniformed men from his place in the 
rear of a long open car. 

“What’s it all about, Jake?” Ret- 
ief enquired. “Since the parasites 
have all left peacefully, I’m having 
a hard time figuring out who’d be 
holed up in the pumping station — 
and why. Maybe they haven’t gotten 
the word that it’s all going to be 
fun and games from now on.” 

“If the corporal sees you over 
here — ” 

“Ah, the good corporal. Glad you 
mentioned him, Jake. He’s the man 
to see.” Retief stepped out of the 
car and started through the crowd. 
A heavy lorry loaded with an im- 
mense tanlf with the letter H bla- 
zoned on its side trundled into the 
square from a side street, moved 
up to a position before the building. 
A smaller car pulled alongside So- 
zier’s limousine. The driver stepped 
down, handed something to Sozier. 
A moment later, Sozier’s amplified 
voice boomed across the crowd. 

“You in there, Corasol! This is 
General Sozier, and I’m warning 
you to come out now or you and 
your smart friends are in for a big 
surprise. You think I won’t blast you 
out because I don’t want to wreck 
the planet. You see the tank aboard 
the lorry that just pulled up? It’s 
full of gas — and I got plenty of 
hoses out here to pump it inside 
with. I’ll put men on the roof and 
squirt it in the ventilators.” 

Sozier’s voice echoed and died. 
The militiamen eyed the station. 
Nothing happened. 

“I know you can hear me, damn

IF 




you!” Sozier squalled. “You’d better 
get the doors open and get out here 
fast!” 

Relief stepped to Sozier’s side. 
“Say, Corporal, I didn’t know you 
went in for practical jokes.” 

Sozier jerked around to gape at 
Relief. 

“What are you doing here!” he 
burst out. “I told Jake — where is 
that — ” 

“Jake didn’t like the questions I 
was asking,” Relief said, “so he 
marched me up here to report to 
you.” 

“Jake, you damn fool!” Sozier 
roared. “I got a good mind — ” 

4CT disagree, Sozier,” Relief cut 

A in. “I think you’re a complete 
imbecile. Sitting out here in the 
open yelling at the top of your 
lungs, for example. Corasol and his 
party might get annoyed and spray 
that fancy car you’ve swiped with 
something a lot more painful than 
words.” 

“Eh?” Sozier’s head whipped 
around to stare at the building. 

“Isn’t that a gun I see sticking 
out?” 

Sozier dropped. “Where?” 

“My mistake. Just a foreign par- 
ticle on my contact lenses.” Relief 
leaned on the car. “On the other 
hand, Sozier, most murderers are 
sneaky about it. I think making a 
public announcement is a nice ges- 
ture on your part. The Monitors 
won’t have any trouble deciding who 
to hang when they come in to 
straighten out this mess.” 

Sozier scrambled back onto his 
seat. “Monitors?” he snarled. “I 



don’t think so. I don’t think you’ll be 
around to do any blabbering to any- 
body.” He raised his voice. “Jake! 
March this spy over to the sidelines. 
If he tries anything, shoot him!” He 
gave Relief a baleful grin. “I’ll lay 
the body out nice and ship it back 
to your cronies. Accidents will hap- 
pen, you know. It’ll be a week or 
two before they get around to fol- 
lowing up — and by then I’ll have 
this little problem under control.” 

Jake looked at Relief uncertainly, 
fingering his empty rifle. 

Relief put his hands up. “I guess 
you got me, Jake,” he said. “Careful 
of that gun, now.” 

Jake glanced at Sozier, gulped, 
aimed the rifle at Relief and nodded 
toward the car. As Relief moved 
off, a murmur swept across the 
crowd. Relief glanced back. A turret 
on the station roof was rotating 
slowly. A shout rose; men surged 
away from the building, scuffling 
for way; Sozier yelled. His car start- 
ed up, moved forward, horns blar- 
ing. As Relief watched, a white 
stream arced up from the turret, 
catching the sun as it spanned the 
lawn, plunged down to strike the 
massed men in a splatter of spray. 
It searched across the mob, came to 
rest on Sozier’s car. Uniformed men 
scrambled for safety as the terrified 
driver gunned the heavy vehicle. The 
hose followed the car, dropping a 
solid stream of water on Sozier, 
kicking and flailing in the back seat. 
As the car passed from view, down 
a side street, water was overflowing 
the sides. 

“The corporal will feel all the bet- 
ter for an invigorating swim in his

mobile pool,” Retief commented. 
“By the way, Jake, I have to be go- 
ing now. It wouldn’t be fair to send 
you back to your boss without some- 
thing to back up your story that you 
were outnumbered, so — ” 

Retief s left fist shot out to con- 
nect solidly with Jake’s jaw. Jake 
dropped the gun and sat down hard. 
Retief turned and headed for the 
pumping station. The hose had shut 
down now. A few men were stand- 
ing, eyeing the building anxiously. 
Others watched his progress across 
the square. As Retief passed, he 
caught scattered comments: 

“ — seen that bird before.” 

“ — where he’s headed.” 

“ — feller Sozier was talking to...” 
“Hey, you!” 

Retief was on the grass now. 
Ahead, the blank wall loomed up. 
He walked on briskly. 

“Stop that jasper!” a shout rang 
out. There was a sharp whine and 
a black spot appeared on the wall 
ahead. Near it, a small personnel 
door abruptly swung inward. Re- 
tief sprinted, plunged through the 
opening as a second shot seared the 
paint on the doorframe. The door 
clanged behind him. Retief glanced 
over the half dozen men confronting 
him. 

“I’m Retief, CDT, acting Charge,” 
he said. “Which of you gentlemen 
is Manager-General Corosol?” 

C orasol was a tall, wide-shoul- 
dered man of fifty, with shrewd 
eyes, a ready smile, capable-looking 
hands and an urbane manner. He 
and Retief sat at a table at one 
side of the large room, under a maze 



of piping, tanks and valves. Cora- 
sol poured amber fluid into square 
glass tumblers. 

“We spotted you by the blazer,” 
he said. “Baby blue and gold braid 
stand out in a crowd.” 

Retief nodded. “The uniform has 
its uses,” he agreed. He tried the 
drink. “Say, what is this? It’s not 
bad.” 

“Sugarweed rum. Made from a 
marine plant. We have plenty of 
ocean here on Glave; there’s only 
the one continent, you know, and 
it’s useless for agriculture.” 

“Weather?” 

“That’s part of it. Glave is moving 
into what would be a major glacia- 
tion if it weren’t for a rather elab- 
orate climatic control installation. 
Then there are the tides. Half the 
continent would be inundated twice 
a year when our satellite is at aphel- 
ion; there’s a system of baffles, locks 
and deep-water pumps that maintain 
the shore-line more or less constant. 
We still keep our cities well inland. 
Then there are the oxygen genera- 
tors, the atmosphere filtration com- 
plex, vermin control and so on. 
Glave in its natural state is a rather 
hostile world.” 

“I’m surprised that your mines can 
support it all.” 

“Oh, they don’t.” Corasol shook 
his head. “Two hundred years ago, 
when the company first opened up 
Glave, it was economical enough. 
Quintite was a precious mineral in 
those days. Synthetics have long 
since taken over. Even fully auto- 
mated, the mines barely support the 
public services and welfare sys- 
tem.” 



20 



IF 




“I seem to recall a reference in 
the Post Report to the effect that a 
company petition to vacate its char- 
ter had been denied . 

Corasol nodded, smiling wryly. 
“The CDT seemed to feel that as 
long as any of the world’s residents 
desired to remain, the Company was 
constrained to oblige them. The 
great majority departed long ago, of 
course. Relocated to other opera- 
tional areas. Only the untrainables, 
living off welfare funds — and a skel- 
eton staff of single men to operate 
the technical installations — have 
stayed on.” 

“That explains the mechanics of 
the recent uprising,” Retief said. 

The bottle clinked against glasses 
for a second round. “What about the 
good corporal?” Retief asked. “As- 
suming he’s a strong swimmer, you 
should be hearing from him soon.” 
Corasol glanced at his finger 
watch. “I imagine he’ll be launching 
his gas attack any minute.” 

“The prospect doesn’t seem to 
bother you.” 

“Sozier is a clever enough chap in 
his own way,” Corasol said. “But he 
has a bad habit of leaping to con- 
clusions. He’s gotten hold of a tank 
of what someone has told him is 
gas — as indeed it is. Hydrogen, for 
industrial use. It seems the poor fel- 
low is under the impression that 
anything masquerading as gas will 
have a lethal effect.” 

“He may be right — if he pumps 
it in fast enough.” 

“Oh, he won’t be pumping it. Not 
after approximately five minutes 
from now.” 

“Hmmm. I think I’m beginning to 



see the light. ‘Power off at sunset.’ ” 
Corasol nodded. “I don’t think 
he realizes somehow that all his ve- 
hicles are operating off broadcast 
power.” 

“Still, he has a good-sized crowd 
of hopefuls with him. How do you 
plan to get through them?” 

“We don’t. We go under. There’s 
an extensive system of service ways 
underlying the city; another detail 
which I believe has escaped the cor- 
poral’s notice.” 

“You’ll be heading for the port?” 
“Yes — eventually. First, we have 
a few small chores to see to. Sozier 
has quite a number of our technical 
men working at gun point to keep 
various services going.” 

Retief nodded. “It won’t be easy 
breaking them out. I made a fast 
tour of the city this afternoon. 
Locked doors, armed guards — ” 
“Oh, the locks are power-operat- 
ed, too. Our fellows will know what 
to do when the power fails. I think 
the sudden darkness will eliminate 
any problem from the guards.” 

The lights flickered and died. The 
whine of the turbines was suddenly 
noticeable, descending. Faint cries 
sounded from outside. 

Corasol switched on a small por- 
table lantern. “All ready, gentle- 
men?” he called, rising. “Let’s move 
out. We want to complete this op- 
eration before dawn.” 

F our hours later, Retief stood 
with Corasol in a low-ceilinged 
tunnel, white-tiled, brilliantly lit by 
a central glare strip, watching as the 
last of the column of men released 
from forced labor in the city’s util-

ities installations filed past. A solid- 
ly-built man with pale blond hair 
came up, breathing hard. 

“How did it go, Taine?” Corasol 
asked. 

“They’re beginning to catch on, 
Mr. Corasol. We had a brisk time 
of it at Station Four. Everybody’s 
clear now. No one killed, but we had 
a few injuries.” 

Corasol nodded. “The last few 
crews in have reported trouble. Ah 
— what about — ” 

Taine shook his head. “Sorry, sir. 
No trace. No one’s seen them. But 
they’re probably at the port ahead 
of us, hiding out. They’d know we’d 
arrive eventually.” 

“I suppose so. You sent word to 
them well in advance . .” 

“Suppose I stand by here with a 
few men. We’ll patrol the tunnels in 
case they show up. We have several 
hours before daylight.” 

“Yes. I’ll go along and see to the 
preparations at Exit Ten. We’ll make 
our sortie at oh-five-hundred. If you 
haven’t seen anything of them by 
then .” 

“I’m sure they’re all right.” 
“They’d better be.” Corasol said 
grimly. “Let’s be off. Relief.” 

“If it’s all the same to you, Mr. 
Manager-General. I’ll stay here with 
Taine. I’ll join you later ” 

“As you wish. I don’t imagine 
there’ll be any trouble — but if there 
is. having a CDT observer along will 
lend a certain air to the operation.” 
He smiled, shook Retief’s hand and 
moved off along the tunnel. The 
echo of feet and voices grew faint, 
faded to silence. Taine turned to the 
three men detailed to him, conversed 



briefly, sent them off along branch- 
ing corridors. He glanced at Retief. 

“Mr. Retief, you’re a diplomat. 
This errand is not a diplomatic one.” 

“I’ve been on a few like that, too, 
Mr. Taine.” 

Taine studied Retief’s face. “I can 
believe that,” he said. “However, I 
think you’d better rejoin the main 
party.” 

“I might be of some use here, if 
your missing men arrive under fire.” 

“Missing men?” Tine’s mouth 
twisted in a sour smile. “You fail to 
grasp the picture, Mr. Retief. 
There’ll be no missing men arriv- 
mg. 

“Oh? I understood you were wait- 
ing here to meet them.” 

“Not men, Mr. Retief. It happens 
that Corasol has twin daughters, 
aged nineteen. They haven’t been 
seen since the trouble began.” 

V 

H alf an hour passed. Retief 
leaned against the tunnel wall, 
arms folded, smoking a cigar in 
silence. Taine paced, ten yards up the 
corridor, ten yards back . 

“You seem nervous, Mr. Taine,” 
Retief said. 

Taine stopped pacing, eyed Ret- 
ief coldly. “You’d better go along 
now,” he said decisively. “Just follow 
the main tunnel. It’s about a mile.” 
“Plenty of time yet, Mr. Taine.” 
Retief smiled and drew on his cigar. 
“Your three men are still out.” 
“They won’t be back here. We’ll 
rendezvous at Exit Ten.” 

“Am 1 keeping you from some- 
thing, Taine?”

‘‘I can’t be responsible for your 
safety if you stay here.” 

“Oh? You think I might fall vic- 
tim to an accident?” 

Taine narrowed his eyes. “It could 
happen,” he said harshly. 

“Where were the girls last seen?” 
Retief asked suddenly. 

“How would I know?” 

“Weren’t you the one who got 
word to them?” 

“Maybe you’d better keep out of 
this.” 

“You sent your men off; now 
you’re eager to see me retire to a 
safe position. Why the desire 
for solitude, Taine? You wouldn’t 
by any chance have plans?” 

“That’s enough,” Taine snapped. 
“On your way. That’s an order!” 
“There are some aspects of this 
situation that puzzle me, Mr. Taine. 
Mr. Corasol has explained to me 
how he and his Division Chiefs — in- 
cluding you — were surprised in the 
executive suite at Planetary Central 
by a crowd of Sozier’s bully-boys. 
They came in past the entire securi- 
ty system without an alarm. Corasol 
and the others put up a surprisingly 
good fight and made it to the service 
elevators — and from there to the 
sub-station. There was even time to 
order an emergency alert to the en- 
tire staff — but somehow, they were 
all caught at their stations and kept 
on the job at gun point. Now, I 
should think that you, as Chief of 
Security as well as Communications, 
should have some ideas as to how 
all this came about.” 

“Are you implying — ” 

“Let me guess, Taine. You have a 
deal with Sozier. He takes over, ousts 



the legal owners, and sets himself up 
to live off the fat of the land, with 
you as his technical chief. Then, I 
imagine, you’d find it easy enough 
to dispose of Sozier — and you’d be 
in charge.” 

W ithout warning Taine put 
his head down arid charged. 
Retief dropped his cigar, side- 
stepped and planted a solid right on 
Taine’s jaw. He staggered, went to 
his hands and knees. 

“I suppose you’d like to get word 
to Sozier that his work force is ar- 
riving at the port at oh-five-hun- 
dred,” Retief said. “Of course, he’ll 
want to have a good-sized reception 
committee on hand as they come 
out.” 

Taine plunged to his feet, threw 
a vicious left that went past Retief’s 
ear, then abruptly dropped, clamped 
a lock on Retief’s leg, twisted — 
The two men rolled, came to 
rest with Taine on top, Retief face- 
down, his arm bent back and 
doubled. Taine, red-faced and puff- 
ing, grunted as he applied pressure. 

“You know a lot about me,” he 
grated, “but you overlooked the fact 
that I’ve been Glavian Judo cham- 
pion for the past nine years.” 
“You’re a clever man, Taine,” Re- 
tief said between clenched teeth. 
“Too clever to think it will work.” 
“It will work. Glave’s never had 
a CDT mission here before. We’re 
too small. Corasol invited your Em- 
bassy in because he had an idea 
there was something in the wind. 
That forced my hand. I’ve had to 
move hastily. But by the time I in- 
vite observers in to see for them-

selves, everything will be running 
smoothly. I can even afford to let 
Corasol and the others go — I’ll 
have hostages for his good behavior.” 

“You’ve been wanting to boast 
about it to someone who could ap- 
preciate your cleverness, I see. So- 
zier must be an unappreciative au- 
dience.” 

“Sozier’s a filthy pig — but he had 
his uses.” 

“What do you plan to do now?” 

“I’ve been wondering that myself 

— but I think the best solution is to 
simply break your arm for now. 
You should be easy to control then. 
It’s quite simple. I merely apply pres- 
sure, thus . .” 

“Judo is a very useful technique,” 
Relief said. “But in order to make 
it work, you have to be a pretty 
good man . .” He moved suddenly, 
shifting his position. Taine grabbed, 
holding Relief’s arm by the wrist 
and elbow, his own arm levering Re- 
lief’s back, back . Relief twisted 
onto his side, then his back. Tiane 
grunted, following the movemwit, 
straining. Slowly, Relief sat up 
against Taine’s weight. Then, with a 
surge, he straightened his arm. 
Taine’s grip broke. Relief came to 
his feet. Taine scrambled up in time 
to meet a clean uppercut that 
snapped him. onto his back — out 
cold. 

4 4 A h, there you are,” Relief 
said as Taine’s eyes fluttered 
and opened. “You’ve had a nice nap 

— almost fifteen minutes. Feeling 
better?” 

Taine snarled, straining against 
the bonds on his wrists. 



“Gold braid has its uses,” Relief 
commented. “Now that you’re back, 
perhaps you can answer a question 
a question for me. What’s the 
Birthday Cake?” 

Taine spat. Relief went to stand 
over him. 

“Time is growing short, Mr. 
Taine. It will be dawn in another two 
hours. I can’t afford the luxury of 
coaxing you.” 

“You won’t get away will) this.” 

Relief looked at the glowing end 
of his cigar. “This won’t be subtle, 
I agree — but it will work.” 

“You’re bluffing.” 

Relief leaned closer. “In my place 
— would you hesitate?” he asked 
softly. 

Taine cursed, struggled to break 
free, eyes on the cigar. 

“What kind of diplomat are you?” 
he snarled. 

“The modern variety. Throat-cut- 
ting, thumb-screws, poison and stil- 
etto work were popular in Machia- 
velli’s time; nowadays we go in more 
for the administrative approach — 
but the cigar-end still has its role.” 

“Look, we can come to an agree- 
ment — ” 

“What’s the Birthday Cake?” Re- 
lief snapped. 

“I’m in a position to do a lot for 
you!” 

“Last chance — ” 

“It’s the official Residence of the 
Manager-General!” Taine screeched, 
writhing away from the cigar. 

“Where is it? Talk fast!” 

“You’ll never get close! There’s a 
seven-foot wall and by this time the 
grounds are swarming with Sozier’s 
men.”

IF 




“Nevertheless, I want to know 
where it is — and the information 
had better be good. If I don’t come 
back, you’ll have a long wait.” 

Taine groaned. “All right. Put that 
damned cigar away. I’ll tell you what 
I can...” 

R elief stood in the shadow of 
a vine-grown wall, watching the 
relief of the five-man guard detail at 
the main gate to the Residence 
grounds. The bluish light of the Gla- 
vian satellite reflected from the rain- 
pocked street, glinted from the 
leaves of a massive tree ten yards 
from the gate. The chill in the air 
cut through Retief’s wet clothes. The 
men at the gate huddled, hands in 
pockets, coat collars turned up, 
backs to the wind — and to Relief. 
He moved silently forward, caught 
a low branch of the tree, pulled him- 
self up. 

The men at the gate exchanged 
muttered remarks. One lit a cigarette. 
Relief waited, then moved higher. 
The guards talked in low voices, 
edged closer to the shelter of the 
gate-house. Relief lowered himself 
onto the wall, dropped down onto 
the sodden lawn, crouched, waiting. 
There was no alarm. 

Through ihe trees the dark shape 
of the house loomed up, its top storey 
defiantly ablaze with lights. Re- 
lief moved off silently, from the 
shadow of one tree to the next, 
swinging in an arc that would bring 
him to the rear of the great round 
structure. He froze as the heavy 
footfalls of one of Sozier’s pickets 
slogged past five yards from him, 
then moved on. The glow of a camp- 



fire flickered near the front of the 
house. Relief could make out the 
shapes of men around it — a dozen 
or two, at least. Probably as many 
more warmed themselves at each of 
the other fires visible on the grounds 
— and most of the rest had doubt- 
less found dryer shelter in the lee of 
the house itself. 

Relief reached the conservatory at 
the rear of the house, studied the 
dark path leading to the broad ter- 
race, picked out the squat shape of 
the utilities manifold behind a screen 
of shrubbery. So far, Taine’s infor- 
mation had been accurate. The next 
step was to — 

There was a faint sound from high 
above, followed by a whoosh! Then 
with a sharp crack! a flare appeared 
overhead, rocking gracefully, flost- 
ing down gently under a small para- 
chute. Below it, inky shadows rocked 
in unison. 

In the raw white light. Relief 
counted eighteen men clinging to 
handholds on the side of the house, 
immobile in the pitiless glare. Above 
them, a face appeared, then a sec- 
ond, peering over the edge of the 
fourth-storey gallery. Both figures 
rose, unlimbering four-foot bows, 
fitting arrows to strings — 

Whok! Whok! Two men lost their 
holds and fell, yelling, to slam into 
the heavy shrubbery. A second flight 
of arrows found marks. Relief 
watched from the shadows as man 
after man dropped to flounder in 
the wet foliage. Several jumped be- 
fore the deadly bows were turned 
on them. As the flare faded, the last 
of the men plunged down to crash 
among their fellows. Retief stepped

ovty ran swiftly to the manifold, 
forcing his way among the close- 
growing screen, scrambled to its top. 
His hand fell on a spent arrow. He 
picked it up. 

It was a stout wooden shaft twen- 
ty inches long, terminating in a rub- 
ber suction cup. Retief snorted, 
dropped the arrow and started up. 

VI 

T wenty feet above ground level, 
the wide windows of the third 
floor sun terrace presented a pre- 
carious handhold as Retief swung 
back a foot and kicked in a panel. 
Inside, he dimly made out the 
shape of a broad carpeted room, 
curving out of sight in both direc- 
tions. There were wide-leaved trop- 
ical plants in boxes, groups of padd- 
ed chairs, low tables with bowls of 
fruit. Retief made his way past 
them, found an inner door, went 
into a dark hall. At the far end, 
voices exchanged shouted questions. 
Feet pounded. A flicker of light 
from a hand lantern splashed across 
the wall, disappeared. Retief found 
a stair, went up it noiselessly. Ac- 
cording to Taine, the elevator to 
the top floor apartment should be 
to the left — 

Retief flattened himself to the 
wall. Footsteps sounded near at 
hand. He moved quickly to a door- 
way. There was a murmur of voices, 
the wavering light of lanterns. A 
party of uniformed men tiptoed past 
a cross corridor, struggling under the 
weight of a massive log, two feet 
in diameter and twelve feet long. 

. on signal, hit it all together. 



Then . someone was saying. 

Retief waited, listening. There 
was the creak of a door, the fum- 
bling of awkwardly laden feet on 
a stair, hoarse breathing, a muffled 
curse. 

“ . got my fingers, you slob!” a 
voice snarled. 

“Shaddup!” another voice hissed. 

There was a long moment of si- 
lence, then a muffled command — 
followed an instant later By a thun- 
derous crash, a shout — -cut off 
abruptly by a ponderous blaml fol- 
lowed instantly by a roar like a burst 
dam, mingled with yells, thumps, 
crashes. A foamy wash of water 
surged along the cross corridor, fol- 
lowed a moment later by a man 
sliding on his back, then another, 
two more, the log, fragments of a 
door, more men. 

In the uproar, Retief moved along 
to the elevator, felt over the control 
panel, located a small knurled but- 
ton. He turned it. The panel came 
away. He fumbled cautiously, found 
a toggle switch, flipped it. A light 
sprang up in the car. Instantly Re- 
tief flipped the light switch; the 
glow faded. He waited. No alarm. 
Men were picking themselves up, 
shouting. 

. them broads dropped a hun- 
dred-gallon bag of water ...” Some- 
one complained. 

“ ... up there fast, men. We got 
the door okay!” 

Feet thumped. Yells sounded. 

“No good, Wes! They got a safe 
or something in the way!” 

Retief silently closed the lift door, 
pressed the button. With a sigh, the 
car slid upward, came to a gentle

stop. He eased the door open, looked 
out into a dim-lit entrance hall. Foot- 
steps sounded beyond a door. He 
waited; the clack of high heels cross- 
ing a floor. Retief stepped out of 
the car, went to the door, glanced 
into a spacious lounge with rich 
furniture, deep rugs, paintings, a 
sweep of glass, and in an alcove at 
the far side, a bar. Retief crossed 
the room, poured a stiff drink into 
a paper-thin glass and drained it. 

The high-heeled steps were com- 
ing back now. A door opened. Two 
leggy young women in shorts, with 
red-gold hair bound back by ribbons 
— one green, one blue — stepped in- 
to the room. One girl held a coil 
of insulated wire; the other, a heavy- 
looking gray-enameled box eight 
inches on a side. 

“Now, see if you can tinker that 
generator to get a little more juice, 
Lyn,” the girl with the wire said. 
“I’ll start stringing ...” 

Her voice died as she caught 
sight of Retief. He raised his glass, 
thing to put out about a thousand 
“My compliments, ladies. I see you’re 
keeping yourselves amused.” 

CCTl^ho . who are you?” Lyn 
^ ^faltered. 

“My narhe’s Retief. Your father 
sent me along to carry your bags. 
It’s lucky I arrived when I did, be- 
fore any of those defenseless chaps 
outside were seriously injured.” 
“You’re not . one of them?” 
“Of course he’s not, Lyn,” the sec- 
ond girl said. “He’s much too good- 
looking.” 

“That’s good,” Lyn said crisply. “I 
didn’t want to have to use this thing.” 



She tossed a bright-plated 2 mm 
needier onto a chair and sat down. 
“Dad’s all right, isn’t he?” 

“He’s fine, and we’ve got to be 
going. Tight schedule, you know. 
And you’d better get some clothes 
on. It’s cold outside.” 

Lyn nodded. “Environmental Con- 
trol went off the air six hours ago. 
You can already feel snow coming.” 
“Don’t you suppose we have time 
to just rig up one little old circuit?” 
the other twin wheedled. “Nothing 
serious; just enough to tickle.” 

. “We planned to wire all the win- 
dow frames, the trunk we used to 
block the stair, the lift shaft — ” 
“And then we thought we’d try 
to drop a loop down and pick up the 
gallery guard rail, and maybe some 
of that wrought-iron work around 
the front of the house — ” 

“Sorry, girls; no time.” 

Five minutes later, the twins were 
ready, wrapped in fur robes. Retief 
had exchanged his soaked blazer for 
a down-lined weatherproof. 

“The lift will take us all the way 
down, won’t it?” he asked. 

Lyn nodded. “We can go out 
through the wine cellar.” 

Retief picked up the needier and 
handed it to Lyn. “Hang on to this,” 
he said. “You may need it yet.” 

A cold wind whipped the ramp 
as dawn lightened the sky. 
“It’s hard to believe,” Corasol 
said. “What made him do it?” 

“He saw a chance to own it all.” 
“He can have it,” Corasol’s com- 
municator beeped. He put it to his 
ear. “Everything’s ship-shape and 
ready to lift,” a tiny voice said. 



THE GOVERNOR OF GLAVE

Corasol turned to Retief. “Let’s go 
aboard.” 

“Hold it,” Retief said. “There’s 
someone coming.” 

Corasol spoke into the communi- 
The man slogging across the con- 
cator. “Keep him covered.” 

Crete was short, wrapped in heavy 
garments. Over his head a white cloth 
fluttered from a stick. 

“From the set of those bat-ears, 
I’d ^ay it was the good corporal.” 
“I wonder what he wants.” 

Sozier stopped twenty feet from 
Retief and Corasol. 

“I want to . ah . talk to you, 
Corasol,” he said. 

“Certainly, General. Go right 
ahead.” 

“Look here, Corasol. You can’t do 
this. My men will freeze. We’ll 
starve. I’ve been thinking it over, 
and I’ve decided that we can reach 
an understanding.” 

Corasol waited. 

“I mean, we can get together on 
this thing. Compromise. Maybe I 
acted a little hasty.” Sozier looked 
from Corasol to Retief. “You’re from 
the CDT. You tell him. I’ll guaran- 
tee his people full rights ...” 

Retief puffed at his cigar in si- 
lence. Sozier started again. 

“Look, I’ll give you a full voice in 
running things. A fifty-fi^ty split. 
Whatta you say?” 

“I’m afraid * the proposal doesn’t 
interest me. General,” Corasol said. 

“Never mind the General stuff,” 
Sozier said desperately. “Listen, you 
can run it. Just give me and my 
boys a little say-so.” 

“Sorry.” Corasol shook his head. 
“Not interested. General.” 



“Okay, okay! You win! Just come 
on back and get things straightened 
out! I got a belly full of running 
things!” 

“I’m afraid I have other plans. 
General. For some time I’ve wanted 
to transfer operations to a world 
called Las Palmas on which we hold 
a charter. It has a naturally delight- 
ful climate, and I’m told the fishing 
is good. I leave Glave to the Free 
Electorate with my blessing. Good- 
by, General.” He turned to. the ship. 

“You got to stay here!” Sozier 
howled. “We’ll complain to the 
CDT! And don’t call me General! 
I’m a Corporal — ” 

“You’re a General now — wheth- 
er you like it or not.” Corasol said 
bluntly. He shivered. There was a 
hint of ice in the air. “If you or any 
of your men ever decide to go to 
work. General, I daresay we can 
train you for employment on Las 
Palmas. In the meantime — Long 
Live the Revolution!” 

“You can’t do this! I’ll sue!” 
“Calm down. Sozier,” Retief said. 
“Go back to town and see if you 
can get your radio working. Put in 
a call for Mr. Magnan aboard the 
CDT vessel. Tell him your troubles. 
It will make his day. And a word of 
advice: Mr. Magnan hates a piker — 
so ask for plenty.”

“You’re too kind, Mr. Ambassa-

watch.

“And Magnan tells me that not

and my job secure for another year

able chap.” 

“Oh, you’ll like him, Mr. Ambas-

share all you have.” 

Counsellor of Embassy Magnan 
tapped and entered the office. 

“Forgive the intrusion, Mr. Am-

I must — ” 

“Well, what is it, man? The deal 
hasn’t gone sour?” 

“Oh, far from it! I’ve been explor-

he’ll require a loan.” 

“Yes, yes? How much?” 

Magnan inhaled proudly. “Twen-

“No!” 

“Yes!” 

“Magnificent! Good lord, Mag-

“I can’t wait to make planetfall,

turned to Magnan. “Manager-Gen-

“He was requested by name, Mag-

“Eh? How curious. I never thought

“Perhaps I haven’t been, Mr. Mag-

T hough he was used to the 
tropical sun, a sliver of light re- 
flected from one of the laboratory 
windows stabbed into Craven’s head 
as he crossed the walkway, leading 
his little group of mamlanders. He 
felt une^asy and feverish, more than 
the previous night’s drinking would 
account for. Perhaps he was coming 
down with something, God forbid. It 
would be a rotten time for it, with

“What time did you say that 
plane’s coming from Miami?” asked 
the gray, paunchy man with the 
clipped mustache. Hurrying to catch 
up with Craven, and glancing at his 
wristwatch, he stumbled and swore. 
“I ought to be back in New York 
right now. I hate to be out of the 
country with the situation the way 
it is.” 

“Two-fifteen,” said Craven short- 
ly. “You’ll have plenty of time.” 
“What do you think about the

crisis, Dr. Craven?” one of the wom- 
en asked. She was plump and gray- 
haired. ‘^Aren’t you worried to be 
out here all by yourself? My good- 
ness, I would be.” 

“Oh, I expect it’ll blow over,” Cra- 
ven said indifferently. “They always 
do.” 

“Well, that’s right, they always 
have,** the paunchy man said, sound- 
ing relieved. He paused, squinting 
his eyes to peer out past the white 
concrete pens to the harbor. “Saw 
something jump out there. There’s 
another. Are those some of the ani- 
mals?” 

“Yes, those are the dolphins,” 
Craven said. Irritably he strode for- 
ward to open the laboratory door. 
“This way, please.” 

Inside, it was cooler than out- 
doors, but full of sunlight from the 
big windows overlooking the sea. On 
the wall was an alphabet chart, with 
brightly colored pictures of simple 
objects. The floor was a concrete 
slab, cut away across the far side of 
the room to form a channel open 
at both ends. The water in the chan- 
nel rose and fell with a slow, vertig- 
inous surge. Craven’s head was be- 
ginning to ache. 

“Here’s where we do most of our 
work with the dolphins,” he said. 
“Just a moment, I’ll see if I can get 
one for you.”. He stepped to a wall 
panel, pressed a switch, and spoke 
into the microphone. “Pete, this is 
Charles. Come in, please.” 

A quacking gabble of sound from 
the wall speaker answered him. 

“Okay, come on in,” Craven said, 
and switched off the mike. 

“What was that?” one of the ma- 



trons demanded. “Was that one of 
the dolphins talking?** 

Craven smiled. “That’s right. That 
was Pete, our star pupil. Look out 
the window. And stand back a little 
from the channel, please.” 

There was a nervous shuffling of 
feet as some of the visitors moved 
away from the edge, others crowd- 
ed closer to the windows. Down the 
concrete channel that led past the 
pens directly to the wall of the lab- 
oratory, something gray w^s mov- 
ing with surprising speed. It was 
submerged, but kicked up an occa- 
sional burst of spray. The visitors 
began to murmur in alarm; some 
backed away from the window. 

“Look out!” someone yelled. The 
gray shape burst into the room; the 
water in the channel lifted as if 
about to overflow, then fell back 
with a slapping sound. There was a 
shriek, then nervous laughter. 

I n the channel, balancing itself 
half out of the water, was a 
streamlined, water-bright shape. It 
spoke, in the same quacking gabble 
as before. 

“Okay, Pete,” Craven said. “Out 
you come.” 

“Was it really talking?** someone 
asked behind him. “Could you un- 
derstand what it said?” 

Craven, without bothering to re- 
ply, pressed a switch on the control 
panel. Out of a recess in the wall 
came an electric hoist supporting a 
curved, heavily braced metal plat- 
form. The platform lowered itself 
into the water; the dolphin swam 
into position over it. Craven pressed 
another switch; the platform rose.

streaming water. The hoist moved 
forward again, then lowered its pas- 
senger onto a wheeled framework 
that stood beside the channel. There 
was a click. The supporting arms of 
the hoist rose out of the way. 

On the platform, which now 
formed the bed of the wheeled cart, 
lay a bulky eight-foot mammal. One 
eye was cocked alertly at Craven. 
The mouth, open in what seemed a 
pleasant smile, was full of sharp con- 
icnl teeth. 

“Goodness!” said one of the wom- 
en. “I hope he doesn’t bite!” 
“Dolphins have never been known 
to attack a human being,” Craven 
said perfunctorily. He pressed a but- 
ton on the control panel. “Say hello 
to our visitors, Pete.” 

The dolphin glanced alertly at the 
people standing behind Craven, then 
emitted one of its high-pitched bursts 
of sound. To Craven’s accustomed 
ear the words were blurred but un- 
derstandable. To the others, he 
knew, they were only noise. 

Ho pressed another button on the 
panel. After a moment, the dolphin’s 
recorded voice, slowed down and 
deeper in pitch, came out of the 
speaker. 

“Hello, lai’ss and ge’men.” 

There was a general murmur, 
some nervous laughter, one clear 
voice: ''What did he say?” 

“His mouth didn’t move when he 
talked,” someone commented suspi- 
ciously. 

Craven grinned. “He doesn’t use 
it for talking. That’s for fish. He 
talks through his blowhole — there, 
on the top of his head. Come on over, 
Pete, let’s have a look at you.” 



Obediently, the dolphin glided 
nearer on his cart, trailing a long 
plastic hose. Sprays of water had be- 
gun to spurt out of perforated tubes 
along either side of the cart, making 
the dolphin’s skin gleam wetly. Out 
of this tiny personal rainstorm, .the 
dolphin stared up at the visitors with 
friendly interest. 

“He’s shaped just like a jet 
plane!” one of the male visitors re- 
marked. “Look at the curve of \m 
head and, uh, snout — ” 

Craven smiled at the man. “Sim- 
ilar solutions for similar problems,” 
he said. “Pete’s streamlined, just like 
a pet. He’s a bottle-nosed dolphin — 
Tursions truncatus — the same spe- 
cies Lilly used in his original work. 
He weighs about four hundred 
pounds; his brain is a little bigger 
than a man’s. Pete is more intelli- 
gent than a dog or a monkey. He 
can not only understand commands 
in English — he can talk back to us. 
That’s why we feel this research is 
so important. What we’re doing is 
teaching another species to enter the 
human community.” 

T here was a moment of im- 
pressed silence. That will hold 
them, Craven thought. 

“What are all the gadgets for?” an- 
other man asked. 

“He controls the cart motors with 
those bars under his flukes,” Cra- 
ven said. “The other levers on either 
side are for manipulation — he 
works those with his flippers. Pete’s 
great lack is that he hasn’t any 
hands or feet, you see — but we’re 
trying to make up for that. Show 
them, Pete, okay?”

••Okay, Charless,” said the dolphin 
cheerfully. The cart wheeled, glided 
across the floor to the low bench on 
the far side, leaving a wet path be- 
hind it. Jointed arms extended from 
the front of the cart, groped for a 
pointer, picked it up in metal pin- 
cers. 

“Show us the apple, Pete,” Craven 
said. 

The pointer rose, wavered, came 
to rest with its tip on the bright pic- 
ture of an apple on the wall chart. 

“Now the boy,” Craven said. 
There were murmurs of admiration 
as the dolphin pointed to the boy, 
the dog, the boat. “Now spell cat, 
Pete,” said Craven. The pointer 
spelled out C-A-T 

“Good boy, Pete,” Craven said. 
“Plenty of fish for you today.” 

The dolphin opened his jaws wide, 
emitted a Bronx cheer, then a burst 
of cracklin? dolphin laughter. There 
was a nervous stir among the visi- 
tors. 

“You said dolphins have never 
been known to attack a person,” said 
a gray-eyed girl. It was the first time 
she had spoken, but Craven had 
been aware of her; she was slender 
and pretty, held herself very erect. 

“That’s right,” he said, facing her. 
“It isn’t that they couldn’t — you 
know they kill sharks — but they 
just never have.” 

“Even when people have hurt 
them?” she asked. Her gray eyes 
were sober. 

“That’s correct,” Craven said. 

“And it’s true, isn’t it, that many 
dolphins have been killed in the 
course of this research?” 

Craven felt a little irritated. 



“There were some fatalities, before 
we learned how to handle them,” he 
said shortly. He turned away. “Now 
let’s try something more difficult. 
Show them the chemistry experi- 
ment, Pete.” 

As the dolphin turned toward the 
bench again. Craven commented, 
“This is something Pete has just been 
learning. We’re pretty proud of it.” 

On the bench was a little stand 
with several stoppered bottles, a 
beaker and a row of test tubes. Con- 
trolling the jointed arms with his 
flippers, the dolphin reached out, 
picked up a bottle and pulled the 
stopper. One set of metal pincers 
held the bottle; the other picked up 
a test tube. Slowly Pete made the 
bottle pour into the test tube. It ran 
full and spilled over. The dolphin 
rocked back and forth nervously in 
his cart. 

“Okay, Pete,” Craven said sooth- 
ingly. “Don’t get nervous — it’s all 
right — go ahead.” 

The dolphin set the bottle down 
with a crash, poured the contents of 
the test tube into the beaker. The 
pincers reached for another bottle, 
slipped and tried again. They got 
the bottle on the second try, tilted it 
but missed the test tube. Overcor- 
recting, the dolphin crashed bottle 
and test tube together, and the test 
tube broke. The bottle dropped, 
spilled. 

The dolphin backed his cart away, 
swiveled toward Craven. “Too hard. 
Charless,” he said plaintively. “Too 
hard.” 

Craven’s fists clenched with dis- 
appointment. The creature had done 
it perfectly on the last three tries!

IF 




‘‘Never mind, Pete,” he said. “It’s 
okay — you did fine. Go on out 
and play now.” 

“All finiss?” Pete asked. 

“Yes. So long.” 

“So long.” The dolphin wheeled his 
cart around, glided over to the edge 
of the channel. The jointed arms re- 
tracted. The cart bed tilted slowly; 
the dolphin slid off it into the wa- 
ter, almost without a splash. There 
was a glimpse of his gray body dart- 
ing underwater; then the channel 
was empty. 

O n the way down to the sea- 
plane, Craven found himself 
walking beside the gray-eyed girl. 
“Well, what did you make of it all?” 
he asked her. 

“I thought it was pathetic'' she 
said. Her gray eyes were indignant. 
“You talk about making them enter 
the human community. It’s all 
wrong! He’s a dolphin, not a man. 
He was trying so hard, but the best 
you could turn him into was some- 
thing like a retarded, crippled child. 
I felt so sorry." 

After the visitors were gone. Cra- 
ven was restless. He kept remem- 
bering what the girl had said; there 
was just enough truth in it to make 
it rankle. His headache had not im- 
proved. The sunlight was still oppres- 
sive. He prowled through his living 
quarters, glanced with distaste at the 
black headlines of the day-old Mi- 
ami paper, finally turned on the tele- 
vision. 

“. initials stand for ‘non-radio- 
active heat emitters,’ ” a chubby, 
gray-haired man was saying, enun- 
ciating each word clearly. “Now the 



question is, what would be the con- 
sequences to us if these weapons — ” 

His voice cut off suddenly and a 
placard filled the screen: NEWS 
SPECIAL. Nothing more happened 
for a moment. Craven lit a cigarette 
and waited patiently: probably it 
was something more about the in- 
terminable peace talks in New Del- 
hi. 

A voice said abruptly, “We inter- 
rupt this program to bring you — ” 
Then it stopped, and the placard 
vanished. There was nothing on the 
screen but a raster, and nothing but 
a hiss coming out of the speaker. 

After a moment Craven put his 
cigarette down and punched the 
channel selector. There was nothing 
on any of the channels except 13, 
where a faint gray picture came in 
for a moment, then vanished. 

Craven stared at the machine, 
feeling abruptly frightened. If there 
was something wrong with the set, 
then why would channel 1 3 — ? 

He discovered that he was shak- 
ing. Without trying to understand 
what he was doing, he began to rip 
off his shirt and trousers. Naked ex- 
cept for shoes, he ran to the locker, 
pulled out mask, flippers, air tanks 
and regulator. 

The sky was bright and empty as 
he ran toward the dock — not even 
a plane in sight. Craven shrugged in- 
to his harness, buckled it hastily. 
He glanced toward the buoy that 
marked the underwater station, then 
dropped into the water. 

Halfway out toward the station, 
swimming two fathoms deep. Cra- 
ven knew he had been right. A sud- 
den hissing patter came above him. 



THE SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN

and looking up, transfixed, he saw a 
shower of golden sparks descending, 
each in its furious cloud of bubbles. 
One came so near that he felt its 
heat on his skin. He writhed from 
it, staring incredulously as it fell to 
the bottom ten fathoms below. 

It came to Craven’s stunned mind 
that the thing that must not happen 
had happened: someone had used 
the weapons that were too terrible 
for use. 

T he underwater station was in 
sixteen fathoms, as deep as it 
could have been built without pres- 
surizing the dome. It stood on a 
rocky shelf in deep water, and al- 
though several of the golden sparks 
had fallen around it, none seemed 
to have clung to the dome. Craven 
swam to the lock, let himself in, and 
sat hugging himself, shaken by chills, 
as air slowly filled the chamber. 
Inside, he stared wildly around. 
He heard himself say aloud, “My 
God, what am I going to do?” 
Scraps of information^ from other 
TV broadcasts came back to his 
mind. Those infernal little pellets 
would go on emitting heat for 
months. And this must be only an 
accidental scattering: on the main- 
land, in populated centers, they 
would have fallen thick as hail . 

There was a compressor here in 
the station^ and a tide-driven stand- 
by generator; he could recharge his 
tanks indefinitely; but what about 
food, after ihe canned stuff on the 
shelves was gone? 

Fish. 

Craven felt weak with reaction, 
but could not be still. He adjusted 



his mask and mouthpiece again, 
went out through the lock. 

There seemed to be no more of 
the pellets on the bottom than be- 
fore, and none were falling. Craven 
plucked up his courage, swam to the 
surface. Treading water, he put his 
mask up to stare at the island. 

The laboratories were in flames. 
Behind them, the mountain was one 
mass of yellowish-white smoke: the 
whole island was on fire. 

The sky seemed empty, but Cra- 
ven could not endure its gigantic 
blue stare. He lowered his mask and 
dived again. 

Down in the clear blue depths. 
Craven heard the high-pitched gab- 
ble of dolphin conversation, and 
once or twice saw their gray shapes 
flitting by. A school of plump blues 
swam into view. Craven started, then 
went after it. 

There were spear-guns in the sta- 
tion, but he had not thought to 
bring one. He swam at the fish, 
grasping ineffectually with his hands, 
but they scattered easily around him. 

Vve got to learn, Draven’s mind 
was telling him. This is my element 
now, the sea — Tve got to adapt . 

• Something large and gray swam 
up toward him. Craven stiffened, 
but it was only Pete, gazing at him 
with friendly curiosity. 

The school of blues had reformed 
not far away. Abruptly the dolphin 
wheeled, darted away with a lazy 
surge of his flukes. In a moment 
he was gliding back, with a fat blue- 
fish in his jaws. 

“Look, Charless,” he said kindly, 
“this is the way to catch a fiss . .”

hope and freedom — and being human!

T he girt with the Slider egg glit- 
tering in her hair watched the 
bailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the 
courtroom. He recognized her as 
old Hazeltyne’s daughter Harriet, no 
doubt come to see justice done. She 
didn’t have the hothouse-flower look 
Asa would have expected in a girl 
whose father owned the most valu- 
able of the planetary franchises. She 
was not afraid to meet his eye, the 



eye of a judicially certified criminal. 
There was, perhaps, a crease of puz- 
zlement in her brow, as if she had 
thought crimes were committed by 
shriveled, rat-faced types, and not 
by young biological engineers who 
still affected crewcuts. 

Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne’s general 
manager, was her escort. Asa felt 
certain, without proof, that Dorr 
was the man who had framed him 
for the charge of grand theft by se- 
creting a fresh Slider egg in his lab- 
oratory. The older man stared at 



37 



Asa coldly as he was led out of the 
courtroom and down the corridor 
back to jail. 

Jumpy, Asa’s cellmate, took one 
look at his face as he was put back 
behind bars. 

“Guilty,” Jumpy said. 

Asa glared at him. 

“I know, I know,” Jumpy said 
hastily. “You were framed. But 
what’s the rap?” 

“Five or one.” 

“Take the five,” Jumpy advised. 
“Learn basket-weaving in a nice air- 
conditioned rehab clinic. A year on 
a changeling deal will seem a lot 
longer, even if you’re lucky enough 
to live through it.” 

Asa took four steps to the far wall 
of the cell, stood there briefly with 
his head bent and turned to face 
Jumpy 

“Nope,” Asa said softly. “I’m go- 
ing into a conversion tank. I’m go- 
ing to be a muck man. Jumpy. I’m 
going out to Jordan’s Planet and 
hunt Slider eggs.” 

“Smuggling? It won’t work.” 

Asa didn’t answer. The Hazeltyne 
company had gone after him be- 
cause he had been working on a 
method of keeping Slider eggs alive. 
The Hazeltyne company would be 
happy to see him mark time for 
five years of so-called social reorien- 
tation. But if he could get out to 
Jordan’s Planet, with his physiology 
adapted to the environment of that 
wretched world, he could studv the 
eggs under conditions no laboratory 
could duplicate He might even be 
able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne. 

His only problem would be stay- 
ing alive foi a year. 



A n interview with a doctor from 
the Conversion Corps was re- 
quired for all persons who elected 
changeling status. The law stated 
that potential changelings must be 
fully informed of the rights and ha- 
zards of altered shape before they 
signed a release. The requirement 
held whether or not the individual, 
like Asa, was already experienced. 

By the time humanity traveled to 
the stars, medical biology had made 
it possible to regenerate damaged or 
deficient organs of the body. Regen- 
eration was limited only by ad- 
vanced age. Sonrietime after a man’s 
two hundredth year his body lost 
the ability to be coaxed into grow- 
ing new cells. A fifth set of teeth 
was usually one’s last. As long as sen- 
escence could be staved off, how- 
ever, any man could have bulging bi- 
ceps and a pencil waist, if he could 
pay for the treatment. 

Until the medical associations de- 
clared such treatments unethical 
there was even a short fad of de- 
liberate deformities, with horns at 
the temples particularly popular. 

From regeneration it was a short 
step to specialized regrowth. The 
techniques were perfected to adapt 
humans to the dozen barely habit- 
able worlds man had discovered. 
Even on Mars, the only planet out- 
side Earth in the solar system where 
the human anatomy was remotely 
suitable, a man could work more 
efficiently with redesigned lungs and 
temperature controls than he could 
inside a pressure suit. On more bi- 
zarre planets a few light-years away 
the advantages of changeling bodies 
were greater. 



38 



IF 




Unfortunately for planetary de- 
velopment companies, hardly anyone 
wanted to become a changeling. 
High pay lured few. So a law was 
passed permitting a convicted crim- 
inal to earn his freedom by putting 
in one year as a changeling for 
every five years he would otherwise 
have had to spend in rehabilitation. 

“What types of changelings do you 
have orders for right now, doctor?” 
Asa asked the man assigned to his 
case. It would look suspicious if he 
asked for Jordan’s Planet without 
some preliminary questions. 

“Four,” answered the doctor. 

“Squiffs for Nev' Arcady. Adapted 
for climbing the skycraper trees and 
with the arm structure modified into 
pseudo-wings or gliding. Then we 
need spiderinos for Von Neumann 
Two. If you want the nearest thing 
we have to Earth, there’s Caesar’s 
Moon, where we’d just have to 
double your tolerance for carbon 
monoxide and make you a bigger 
and better gorilla than the natives. 
Last, of course, there’s always a 
need for muck men on Jordan’s 
Planet.” 

The doctor shrugged, as if nat- 
urally no one could be expected to 
choose Jordan’s Planet. Asa frowned 
in apparent consideration of the al- 
ternatives. 

“What’s the pay range?” he asked. 

“Ten dollars a day on Caesar’s 
Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or 
Von Neumann Two. Twenty-five on 
Jordan’s.” 

Asa raised his eyebrows. 

“Why such a difference? Every- 
one knows about muck men living in 
the mud while they hunt Slider eggs. 



But don’t your conversions make the 
changeling comfortable in his new 
environment?” 

“Sure they do,” said the doctor. 
“We can make you think mud feels 
better than chinchilla fur and we can 
have you jumping like a grasshopper 
despite the double gravity. But we 
can’t make you like the sight of 
yourself. And we can’t guarantee 
that a Slider won’t kill you.” 

“Still,” Asa mused aloud, “it would 
mean a nice bankroll waiting at the 
end of the year.” 

He leaned forward to fill in the 
necessary form. 

S ince it was cheaper to trans- 
port a normal human than to 
rig special environments in a space- 
ship, every planet operated its own 
conversion chambers. On the space 
freighter that carried him from Earth 
Asa Graybar was confined to a 
small cabin that was opened only 
for a guard to bring meals and take 
out dirty dishes. He was still a pris- 
oner. 

Sometimes he could hear voices 
in the passageway outside, and once 
one of them sounded like a wom- 
an’s. But since women neither served 
on spaceships nor worked in the 
dome settlements on harsher worlds, 
he decided it was his imagination. 
He might have been dead cargo for 
all he learned about space travel. 

Nevertheless his time was not 
wasted. He had as a companion, or 
cellmate, another convict who had 
elected conversion to muck man. 
More important, his companion had 
done time on Jordan’s Planet before 
and had wanted to return.

IF 




“It’s the Slider eggs,” explained 
Kershaw, the two-time loser. “The 
ones you see on Earth knock your 
eyes out, but they’ve already begun 
to die. There’s nothing like a fresh 
one. And I’m not the first to go 
crazy over them. When I was recon- 
verted and got home I had nine 
thousand dollars waiting for me. 
That’ll buy a two-year-old egg that 
flashes maybe four times a day. So 
I stole a new one and got caught.” 

Asa had held a Slider egg in his 
hand as he gazed into it. He could 
understand. The shell was clear as 
crystal, taut but elastic, while the al- 
bumen was just as clear around the 
sparkling network of organic fila- 
ments that served as a yolk. Along 
these interior threads played tiny 
flashes of lightning, part of some un- 
explained process of life. Electrical 
instruments picked up static dis- 
charges from the egg, but the phe- 
nomenon remained a mystery. 

Hardly anyone faced with the 
beauty of a Slider’s egg bothered to 
question its workings. For a few ex- 
pectant moments there would be 
only random, fitful gleamings, and 
then there would be a wild corus- 
cation of light, dancing from one 
filament to the next in a frenzy of 
brillance. 

It took about four years for a 
Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and 
fading value made the eggs a luxury 
item like nothing the world had ever 
seen. If Asa had found a means of 
keeping them alive it would have 
made him wealthy at the expense of 
the Hazeltyne monopoly. 

“You know what I think?” Ker- 
shaw asked. “I think those flashes 



are the egg calling its momma. They 
sparkle like a million diamonds 
when you scoop one out of the 
muck, and right away a Slider al- 
ways comes swooping out of no- 
where at you.” 

“I’ve been meaning to ask you,” 
Asa said. “How do you handle the 
Sliders?” 

Kershaw grinned. 

“First you try to catch it with a 
rocket. If you miss you start leap- 
ing for home. All this time you’re 
broadcasting for help, you under- 
stand. When the Slider catches you, 
you leap up while it buries its jaws 
in the mud where you were just 
standing. You dig your claws in its 
back and hang on while it rolls 
around in the mud. Finally, if the 
’copter comes — and if they don’t 
shoot off your head by mistake — 
you live to tell the tale.” 

II 

A sa Graybar kept his normal 
form on Jordan’s Planet just 
long enough to learn the discomfort 
of double gravity. He was told he 
needed another physical examination 
and was taken right in to a doctor. 
His heart was pounding to keep his 
blood circulating on this mas- 
sive world, but the doctor had ap- 
parently learned to make allowances. 

“Swallow this,” said the doctor 
after making a series of tests. 

Asa swallowed the capsule. Two 
minutes later he felt himself begin- 
ning to lose consciousness. 

“This is it!” he thought in panic. 
He felt someone ease him back 
down onto a wheeled stretcher. Be-

fore consciousness faded completely 
he realized that no one got a chance 
to back out of becoming a change- 
ling, that he was on his way to the 
conversion tank right now. 

When he finally awoke he felt 
well rested and very comfortable. 
But for a long time he was afraid 
to open his eyes. 

“Come on, Graybar,” said a deep, 
booming voice. “Let’s test our 
wings.” 

It was not Kershaw’s voice, but 
it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened 
his eyes. 

Everyone had seen pictures of 
muck men. It was different having 
one stand beside you. Kershaw 
looked much like an enormous frog 
except that his head was still mostly 
human. He was sitting on webbed 
feet, his lower legs bent double un- 
der huge thighs, and his trunk tilted 
forward so that his arms dangled to 
the ground. The arms were as thick 
around as an ordinary man’s legs. 
The hands had become efficient 
scoops, with broad fingers webbed 
to the first joint and tipped with 
spade-like claws. The skin was still 
pinkish but had become scaly. Not 
a thread of hair showed anywhere 
on the body, not even on the head. 

This, Asa realized, was what he 
looked like himself. 

It would have been more bearable 
if the head had not retained strong 
traces of humanity The nostrils 
flared wide and the jaws hardly 
emerged from the neck, but the ears 
were human ears and the eyes, un- 
der those horny ridges, were human 
eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could 
still weep. 



He started to walk forward and 
tipped over on his side. Kershaw 
laughed. 

“Come to daddy, babykins,” Ker- 
shaw said, holding out his hands. 
“Only try hopping this time. And 
take it easy.” 

Asa pushed himself upright with 
one arm and tried a small hop. 
Nerve and muscle coordination was 
perfect. He found himself leaping as 
high as Kershaw’s head. 

“That’s the way,” -Kershaw said 
approvingly. “Now get this on and 
we’ll go outside.” 

Asa snapped on a belt and breech 
cloth combination that had flaps of 
fabric dangling from the belt in 
front and behind. He followed as 
Kershaw pushed open a sliding door 
to lead the way out of the room 
where they had been left to revive 
from conversion. 

T hey went into a courtyard 
partly covered by a roof pro- 
jecting from the Hazeltyne com- 
pany’s dome settlement. The far half 
of the courtyard was open to the 
gray drizzle that fell almost cease- 
lessly from the sky of Jordan’s 
Planet and turned most of its sur- 
face into marsh and mud flats. A 
high wall enclosed the far portion of 
the courtyard. Ranged along the 
wall were thirty stalls for muck men. 

From fifty yards across the court- 
yard a muck man bounded over to 
them in two leaps. Attached to a 
harness across his shoulders and 
chest were a gun and a long knife. 

“Names?” he growled. He was 
a foot taller than Graybar and big 
everywhere in proportion.

IF 




“Kershaw. I’m back, Furston.” 

“I’m Graybar.” 

“Kershaw again? Just start in 
where you left off, sucker. Come 
on, you.” He pointed to Asa and 
leaped to the open portion of the 
courtyard. 

“Do what he says,” Kershaw whis- 
pered to Graybar. “He’s sort of a 
trusty and warden and parole offi- 
cer rolled into one.” 

Asa was put through a series of 
exercises to get him used to his dis- 
torted body, to teach him how to 
leap and how to dig. He was shown 
how to operate the radio he would 
carry and how to fire the pencil- 
slim rockets of this gun. Finally he 
was told to eat a few berries from a 
native vine. He did so and immedi- 
ately vomited. 

Furston laughed. 

“That’s to remind you you’re still 
a man,” Furston said, grinning. “Ev- 
erything that grows on this planet 
is poison. So if you got any ideas 
of hiding out till your term is up, 
forget ’em. Right here is where you 
eat.” 

Asa turned without a word and 
hopped feebly away from Furston. 
He lifted his head to breathe deep- 
ly and saw two humans watching 
him from an observation tower on 
the roof. 

He leaped twenty feet into the 
air for a closer look. 

Gazing at him with repugnance, 
after witnessing the end of his ses- 
sion with Furston, were Harriet Ha- 
zeltyne and general manager Tom 
Dorr. 

The girl’s presence merely puz- 
zled Asa, but Dorr’s being here wor- 



ried him. Dorr had tried to get rid 
of him once and was now in an ex- 
cellent position to make the riddance 
permanent. 

At supper that night, squatting on 
the ground beside a low table with 
the dozen other muck men, operat- 
ing from the dome, Asa asked what 
the two were doing put here. 

“The girl will inherit this racket 
some day, won’t she?” asked one of 
the others. “She wants to see what 
kind of suckers are making her 
rich.” 

“Maybe that guy Dorr brought 
her along to show her what a big 
wheel he is,” said one of the others. 
“Just hope he doesn’t take over the 
operations.” 

Ill 

N ext morning Furston passed 
out guns, knives, radios, and 
pouches to carry any eggs the muck 
men found. He gave each man a 
compass and assigned the sectors to 
be worked during the day. Finally 
he called Graybar aside. 

“In case you don’t like it here,” 
Furston said, “you can get a week 
knocked off your sentence for every 
egg you bring in. Now get out there 
and work that muck.” 

Furston sent Graybar and Ker- 
shaw out together so that the veteran 
could show Asa the ropes. Asa had 
already learned that the wall around 
the courtyard was to keep Sliders 
out, not muck men in. He leaped 
over it and hopped along after Ker- 
shaw. 

Ftet slapping against the mud, 
they went about five miles from the 



MUCK MAN 



43 




Hazeltyne station, swimming easily 
across ponds too broad to jump. The 
mud, if not precisely as pleasant to 
the touch as chinchilla fur, was not 
at all uncomfortable, and the drip- 
ping air caressed their skins like a 
summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, 
slippery creatures skidded and 
splashed out of their way. Finally 
Kershaw stopped. His experienced 
eye had seen a trail of swamp weeds 
crushed low into the mud. 

“Keep your eyes open,” Kershaw 
said. “There’s a Slider been around 
here lately. If you see something 
like an express train headed our 
way, start shooting.” 

At each leap along the trail they 
peered quickly around. They saw no 
Sliders, but this meant little, for the 
beasts lived under the mud as much 
as on top of it. 

Kershaw halted again when they 
came to a roughly circular area 
some ten yards in diameter where 
the weeds had been torn out and 
lay rotting in the muck. 

“We’re in luck,” he said as Asa 
skidded to a stop at his side. “An 
egg was laid somewhere here within 
the last week. These places are hard 
to spot when the new weeds start 
growing.” 

Kershaw took a long look around. 

“No trouble in sight. We dig.” 

They started at the center of the 
cleared area, shoveling up great gobs 
of^mud with their hands and flinging 
them out of the clearing. Usually 
a muck man dug in a spiral out 
from the center, but Graybar and 
Kershaw dug in gradually widening 
semi-circles opposite each other. 
They had to dig four feet deep, and 



it was slow going until they had a 
pit big enough to stand in. Each 
handful of mud had to be squeezed 
gently before it was thrown away, 
to make sure it didn’t conceal an 
egg. As he worked, Asa kept think- 
ing what an inefficient system it 
was. Everything about the operation 
was wrong. 

“Got it!” Kershaw shouted. He 
leaped out of the pit and started 
wiping slime off a round object the 
size of a baseball. Asa jumped out 
to watch. 

“A big one,” Kershaw said. He 
held it, still smeared with traces of 
mud, lovingly to his cheek, and then 
lifted it to eye level. “Just look at 
it.” 

T he egg was flashing with a 
mad radiance, like a thousand 
brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa’s 
diamonds being splintered under a 
earphones and he thought of what 
Kershaw had said, that the scintil- 
lation of an egg was an effect of its 
calls to a mother Slider for help. 
Asa looked around. 

“Jump!” he shouted. 

At the edge of the clearing a seg- 
mented length of greenish black 
scales, some two feet thick and six 
feet high, had reared up out of the 
weeds. The top segment was almost 
all mouth, already opened to show 
row upon row of teeth. Before Asa 
could draw his gun the Slider low- 
ered its head to the ground, dug two 
front flippers into the mud and shot 
forward. 

Asa leaped with all his strength, 
sailing far out of the clearing. While 
he was still in the air he snapped 



44 



IF 




the mouthpiece of his radio down 
from where it was hinged over his 
head. As he landed he turned instant- 
ly, his gun in his hand. 

“Calling the ’copter!” he spoke 
rapidly into the mouthpiece. “Ker- 
shaw and Graybar, sector eight, five 
miles out. Hurry!” 

“Graybar?” asked a voice in his 
earphone. “What’s up?” 

“We’ve got an egg but a Slider 
wants it back.” 

“On the way.” 

Asa hopped back to the clearing. 
Kershaw must have been bowled 
over by the Slider’s first rush, for 
he was trying to hop on one leg 
as if the other had been broken. 
The egg lay flickering on top of the 
mud where Kershaw had dropped it. 
The Slider, eight flippers on each 
side working madly, was twisting its 
thirty feet of wormlike body around 
for another charge. 

Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rock- 
et at the monster’s middle segment. 
The rocket smashed through hard 
scales and exploded in a fountain of 
gray flesh. The Slider writhed, coat- 
ing its wound in mud, and twisted 
toward Asa. He leaped to one side, 
firing from the air and missing, and 
saw the Slider turn toward the patch 
of weeds where he would land. His 
legs were tensed to leap again the 
moment he hit the mud, but he saw 
the Slider would be on top of him 
before he could escape. As he land- 
ed he thrust his gun forward almost 
into the mouth of the creature and 
fired again. 

Even as he was knocked aside into 
the muck, Asa’s body was showered 
with shreds of alien flesh scattered 



by the rocket’s explosion. Desperate- 
ly pushing himself to his feet, he saw 
the long headless body shiver and 
lie still. 

A sa took a deep breath and 
looked around. 

“Kershaw!” he called. “Where are 
you?” 

“Over here.” Kershdw stood brief- 
ly above the weeds and fell back 
again. Asa leaped over to him. 

“Thanks,” Kershaw said. “Muck 
men stick together. You’ll make a 
good one. I wouldn’t have had a 
chance. My leg’s busted.” 

“The helicopter ought to be here 
pretty soon,” Asa said. He locked 
over at the dead Slider and shook 
his head. “Tell me, what are the 
odds on getting killed doing this?” 
“Last time I was here there was 
about one mucker killed for every 
six eggs brought out. Of course 
you’re not supposed to stand there 
admiring the eggs like I did while a 
Slider comes up on you.” 

Asa hopped over to the egg, which 
was still full of a dancing radiance 
where it rested on the mud. He 
scooped a hole in the muck and bur- 
ied the egg. 

“Just in case there are any more 
Sliders around,” he explained. 

“Makes no difference,” said Ker- 
shaw, pointing upward. “Here comes 
the ’copter, late as usual.” 

The big machine circled them, 
hovered to inspect the dead Slider, 
and settled down on broad skids. 
Through the transparent nose Asa 
could see Tom Dorr and Harriet 
Hazeltyne. The company manager 
swung the door open and leaned out. 



MUCK MAN

“I see you took care of the Slider,” 
he said. ‘'Hand over the egg.” 

“Kershaw has a broken leg,” Asa 
said. “I’ll help him in and then I’ll 
get the egg.” 

While Kershaw grabbed the door 
frame to help pull himself into the 
helicopter, Asa got under his com- 
panion’s belly and lifted him by the 
waist. He hadn’t realized before 
just how strong his new body was. 
Kershaw, as a muck man, would 
have weighed close to three hundred 
pounds on Earth, close to six hun- 
dred here. 

Dorr made no move to help, but 
the girl reached under Kershaw’s 
shoulder and strained to get him in. 
Once he was inside, Asa saw, the 
cabin was crowded. 

“Are you going to have room for 
me too?” he asked. 

“Not this trip,” Dorr answered. 
“Now give me the egg.” 

Asa didn’t hesitate. “The egg stays 
with me,” he said softly. 

“You do what I tell you, mucker,” 
said Dorr. 

“Nope. I want to make sure you 
come back.” Asa turned his head to 
Harriet. “You see. Miss Hazeltyne, 
I don’t trust your friend. You might 
ask him to tell you about it.” 

Dorr stared at him with narrowed 
eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way 
that worried Asa. 

“Whatever you say, Graybar,” 
Doer said. He turned to the controls. 
In another minute the helicopter was 
in the sky. 

A round trip for the helicopter 
should have taken no more 
than twenty minutes, allowing time 



for Kershaw to be taken out at the 
settlement. 

After an hour passed Asa began 
to worry. He was sure Dorr would 
return for the egg. Finally he real- 
ized that Dorr could locate the egg 
approximately by the body of the 
dead Slider. Dorr could return for 
the egg any time with some other 
muck man to dig for it. 

Asa pulled down the mouthpiece 
of his radio. 

“This is Graybar, calling the heli- 
copter,” he said. “When are you 
coming?” 

There was no answer except the 
hum of carrier wave. 

If he tried to carry the egg back, 
Asa knew. Sliders would attack him 
all along the way. A man had no 
chance of getting five miles with an 
egg by himself. He could leave the 
egg here, of course. Even so he 
would be lucky if he got back, fol- 
lowing a hazy compass course from 
which he and Kershaw had certain- 
ly deviated on their outward trip. 
There were no landmarks in this 
wilderness of bog to help him find 
his way. The workers were supposed 
to home in on radio signals, if they 
lost their bearings, but Dorr would 
deny him that help. 

What was the night like on Jor- 
dan’s Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at 
night. If he could stay awake, and 
if he didn’t faint from hunger in this 
strange new body, and if the Sliders 
left him alone . 

A whirring noise made Asa jump 
in alarm. 

Then he smiled in relief, for it 
was the helicopter, the blessed heli- 
copter, coming in over the swamp. 



46 



IF 





But what if it was Dorr, coming 
back alone to dispose of him with- 
out any witnesses? Asa leaped for 
the carcass of the dead Slider and 
took shelter behind it. 

No machine-gun blast of rockets 
came from the helicopter. The big 
machine swooped low dizzily, tilted 
back in an inexpert attempt to hov- 
er, thumped down upon the mud and 
slid forward. As Asa jumped aside, 
the landing skids caught against the 
Slider’s body and the helicopter 
flipped forward on its nose, one of 
the rotor blades plunging deep into 
the mud. 

Asa leaped forward in consterna- 
tion. Not only was his chance of safe 
passage back to the settlement 
wrecked, but now he would have the 



extra burden of taking care of the 
pilot. When he reached the nose of 
the helicopter he saw that the pilot, 
untangling herself from the controls 
to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne. 

IV 

4 1 A re you hurt?” Asa asked her. 

She reached for his shoulder 
to steady herself as she climbed out 
of the machine. 

‘T guess not,” she said. “But tak- 
ing a fall in this gravity is no fun. 
From the way my face feels I ought 
to be getting a black eye pretty 
soon.” 

“What happened?” 

“I made a fool of myself.” She 
made a face back in the direction of 



A SLIDER EGG 



MUCK AAAN

the settlement. “Dorr wasn’t going 
to come after you. He said anyone 
who talked back to him should try 
arguing with the Sliders.” 

She looked up at the machine-gun 
on the helicopter. 

“They feed at night, you know. 
And they eat their own kind,” she 
said. “The Slider you killed would 
draw them like ants to jam.” 

Asa glanced around quickly to 
make sure no Sliders had already 
come. He eyed the helicopter 
with distaste at the thought of what 
a flimsy fort it would make. 

“Anyway,” Harriet said, “I told 
him he couldn’t just leave you here 
and we started arguing. I lost my 
temper. He thought he had brought 
me to Jordan’s Planet on a fancy 
tour. I told him the real reason I 
was here was to check up for my 
father on the way he was running 
things and there seemed to be a lot 
wrong. So he told me very politely 
I could run things to suit myself 
and he walked off.” 

She shrugged, as if to indicate that 
she had made a mess of things. 

“And you took the helicopter by 
yourself,” Asa said, as if he could 
hardly believe it yet. 

“Oh, back on Earth I can make a 
helicopter do stunts. But I wasn’t 
used to this gravity. I don’t suppose 
you could- make this machine stand 
up straight?” 

Asa tugged at the body of the 
Slider until he got it off the skids of 
the plane. He pulled with all his 
strength at the rotor blade sunk in 
the mud, but the weight of the heli- 
copter was upon it and the mud held 
it with a suction of its own. After 



a few minutes he had to give up. 

“We fight off the Sliders, then,” 
she said, as matter of factly as if 
that problem was settled. “If it’s any 
comfort, I know how to handle the 
machine-gun.” 

“Nope. In this drizzle, at night, 
the Sliders would be on us before 
we could see them. We’ve got to 
try to get back.” He stood in thought 
while she stared at him patiently. 
“What happened to the other muck 
men who went out today?” he asked. 

“They were called in when the 
’copter came out the first time. 
Some of them may not have got 
back yet.” 

A sa started talking into his ra- 
dio. 

“Calling all muck men. This is 
Asa Graybar. All muck men, listen. 
This is Graybar. I am five miles 
out with Miss Hazeltyne, who came 
to rescue me after I saved Kershaw 
from a Slider. The helicopter is 
smashed. We’re slogging in.” 

He looked at her for a nod of 
confirmation and repeated the mes- 
sage. 

“Graybar?” came a voice in his 
earphones. “What do you want?” 
Asa grinned at Harriet as he con- 
tinued. 

“Go on back to the settlement. 
Tell the others. Then organize a par- 
ty to come help us. Bearing 150 
degrees.” 

“Right,” said the unidentified 
voice. 

“I got it too,” said another voice 
in the headset. “Muck men stick to- 
gether.” 

Good, Asa thought. At least two 

IF 



48 




muckers were still out. They would 
tell the others. 

“Cancel all that,” said a third 
voice. “This is Dorr speaking. No- 
body goes out until I give the word.” 

Asa didn’t fancy waiting. 

“By authority of Miss Hazeltyne,” 
he said rapidly, “Dorr is no longer 
manager. I am acting manager.” He 
saw Harriet’s eyebrows go up, for 
she couldn’t hear the other end of 
what was going on. “Disregard 
Dorr,” he continued. “If you can 
help us get back. Miss Hazeltyne will 
make changes to benefit all of us.” 

Before he could say any more 
his ear was stricken with the noise 
of loud static. Dorr was making 
sure no more radio messages got 
through. Asa quickly told Harriet 
what had happened. 

The girl smiled with one side of 
her mouth. 

“Fine,” she said, “but how am 1 
supposed to cross the muck?” 

“On my back,” Asa turned and 
entered the helicopter cabin. All the 
time he had been talking he had been 
worrying about the fact that he had 
only three rockets left for his gun. 
Quickly he checked the ammunition 
for the machinegun, found it was 
the same caliber, and felt that at 
last one break had gone his way. 
He took the plastic ammunition 
belts outside. 

“Load your pockets with these,” 
he told the girl, pulling the rockets 
from their loops. Then, tying the 
plastic belts together, he fashioned 
a sling she could sit in with her legs 
at his sides. Finally he handed her 
his gun. 

“If you see a Slider,” he said, 



“shoot for the head. Now climb on 
and hold tight to my gun harness 
and we’ll try our luck.” 

TT^hen she was astride his back 
Asa checked his compass and 
started jumping. At once he knew 
that the going would be much hard- 
er than he had imagined. Alone he 
could leap twenty-five yards, but her 
weight cut him down to about five 
yards. He kept going, realizing that 
the task was almost beyond his 
strength and not daring to tell her 
that even if his strength held out 
they might not even find the settle- 
ment in this drizzle. 

Hopping, sometimes staggering, 
skirting the wider pools in the 
swamp, A«a managed to go about 
a mile before he had to stop and 
rest. Harriet climbed out of the 
sling and settled down on a patch of 
weeds, a wet and slippery mat upon 
the mud. 

“We’re going to make it,” she said 
cheerfully. 

“I hope so,” he said. “Not just for 
ourselves. A lot of changes should 
be made. There must be millions of 
eggs on this planet. You’re getting 
only a couple hundred a year.” 

He was panting between sen- 
tences and stopped talking until he 
could catch his breath. 

“For one thing,” he continued, 
“rockets are the wrong weapon 
against the Sliders. Flame throwers 
would be better. Of course they’re 
a lot heavier than guns. But every- 
thing about the way you go after 
eggs is wrong. It’s criminal to send 
one man out alone. It’s utterly ir- 
responsible to have only one heli- 



MUCK MAN

copter. You’re putting a price on 
eggs in terms of human lives. Muck 
men are human, you know, no mat- 
ter what we look like.” 

“You are very human,” she said 
softly, “and very brave.” 

He returned her smile, adding, 
“And we’ll both be very dead unless 
we get going.” 

They had traveled considerably 
less than a mile when he had to 
stop again. 

“How would you run things here? 
Harriet asked. 

“Start with new premises. There’s 
no need to make monsters out of 
the muck men. Double their 
strength, and perhaps give them web 
feet, but why legs like a frog? If I 
could walk normally I could be pull- 
ing you on a sled. And why shovel 
hands instead of proper tools? Of 
course you would still have to give 
them a skin for this weather. 

Harriet’s clothing was sodden and 
streaked with mud, and her hair 
was hanging down her head in wet, 
dark tangles that looked like so 
much boiled spinach. The bump 
when the helicopter fell had raised 
a blue-black swelling around her left 
eye. Yet, it occurred to Asa, she 
hadn’t voiced the slightest complaint. 
She was listening intently to his ad- 
vice. 

“I would send parties of three 
men out in a helicopter,” he con- 
tinued. “One would guard the ship 
while the other two hunted eggs. As 
soon as they found an egg they’d 
hop into the ship and be safe.” 

T hey started off again. At the 
first leap Asa saw a Slider a 



hundred yards away. As soon as his 
feet hit the ground he whispered" to 
Harriet. She climbed out of the 
sling and held her gun ready while 
he drew his knife to wait. Long 
minutes passed before he decided 
they had not been seen and it was 
safe to continue. 

Next time they stopped the girl 
turned to Asa with a frown and 
asked, “Just how does Dorr think he 
can get away with this?” 

“Simple.” Asa shrugged. “He’ll say 
the Sliders got us despite all he could 
do. No muck man who could tell a 
different story will live long enough 
to get back to Earth.” 

The sound of a rocket explosion 
came from somewhere off to their 
right. It was the loveliest sound Asa 
had ever heard. 

“The rescue party!” he shouted. 
“Let’s go!” 

Knowing that rockets meant Slid- 
ers, but knowing also that no Slider 
was a match for a team of armed 
men, Asa leaped forward with re- 
newed vigor. Once he misjudged his 
strength and landed in a puddle, 
splashing both of them with slimy 
water, but the girl on his back only 
laughed. They heard the sound of 
another rocket, and Harriet fired 
three shots of her own to attract 
attention. In a few more minutes 
they were happily welcoming six 
muck men. 

“I heard your message,” said one 
of them, “and back at the settlement 
Kershaw told us what had happened. 
Furston tried to stop us and wound 
up with a knife in his belly.. A couple 
of the others were afraid to come, 
and two were shot from the tower by 



50 



IF 




Dorr, but the rest are with you.** 

“Tom Dorr will be tried for mur- 
der,” Harriet prcMnised grimly. 

With different men taking turns 
carrying Harriet for short distances 
they began to make progress rapid- 
ly. The Slider the men had been 
firing at was dead and no more were 
sighted before they came to the set- 
tlement. 

Dorr was waiting for them. He 
fired from the tower, his machine- 
gun burst of rockets cutting through 
one man in mid-leap. Asa’s party 
hugged the mud and fired back. Plas- 
tic showered from the tower win- 
dow, and dust spurted from the con- 
crete around it. 

“Keep me covered,” Asa shouted. 
He 'took the gun from Harriet and 
leaped madly forward until he was 
under the shelter of the side of the 
dome. He waited for one more salvo 
from his party and jumped to the 
tower itself. 

Dorr had vanished, driven out of 
the tower by the rockets. Asa waved 
to the others to come forward and 
hopped into the main quarters of 
the dome. 

He had never been in this part of 
the settlement. Dorr could be lying 
in ambush for him. Asa moved cau- 
tiously, but he was confident that 
his own adjustment to the gravity of 
the planet would give him the ad- 
vantage in any sudden meeting. 



H e looked around the comer and 
down some stairs just in time 
to see the discredited manager, hold- 
ing a sack in one hands, struggle to 
open a door. Asa fired and missed. 
The next moment Dorr was outside. 
Asa leaped to the floor below. » 

One of the normal humans who 
lived in the settlement came out of 
another room, saw Asa and dodged 
back out of sight. 

Outside, Asa could see Dorr la- 
boring to run along the paved road 
that led to the spaceship a quarter of 
a mile away. The fugitive turned 
once and fired wildly as Asa leaped 
after him. The mist was turning into 
heavy rain, and it was getting harder 
to see. 

Another rocket exploded some- 
where out in front of Asa. The sound 
was followed by a scream. One more 
leap and Asa began firing himself. 

A Slider was gently taking into its 
mouth three eggs spilled from the 
sack lying beside what was left of 
Tom Dorr. 

One of Asa’s shots destroyed the 
Slider, destroying the eggs, too as 
the monster’s head exploded. Asa 
didn’t think the eggs mattered much 
right now. 

He shuffled slowly back to the 
settlement, deciding to accept when 
Harriet offered him the manager- 
ship. Some day, if he had his way. 
Slider eggs would be as common on 
Earth as diamonds. END

DAY IN COURT 

BY JONATHAN BRAND 



The man who bears the Earthman’s burden 
must give justice to the Lesser Tribes 
without the Law — who may give it back! 



T he wakey-wakey played Earth 
Is Where My Heart Is and 
Mark Hassall sat up with a pound- 
ing heart. Every simulated morning 
for the last simulated three weeks he 
had woken to the gentle sound of 
Earth Is Where My Heart Is. But 
whatever you set the wakey-wakey 
to play, he reflected sadly, after a 
time it gave you a cold sweat to 
hear \U For any signal which brings 
you to life in the morning after the 
mental death of sleep becomes as- 
sociated with that shock to the sys- 
tem. The fear of death is nothing, 
compared to the fear of life. 

He flicked on the sound transmis- 



sion of his telephone and left the 
visual pickup off. “Yup,” he groaned 
into it. 

The telephone built up the un- 
blushing image of Marylou, Transit 
Station J’s nubile communications 
expert. 

“Marco,” she cooed. “You’re sit-

“You’re damn right I am,” he said. 
“But not any more!” And he curled 
himself modestly up in his electric 
blanket. “Anyway how in hell would

“I’ve eyes in the back of my

erably more than a mere switch- 
board girl. 

“Why don’t you get dressed?” 
said Marylou. 

*T’ll really try and remember to do 
that before I go on duty,” said Mark 
rolling towards the shower. “But I 
don’t promise I’ll get the time.” 

“You just find the time,” she said. 
When she heard the shower start 
she leaned forward across the con- 
trol panel and turned the knob that 
accentuated the yellow register. She 
was a connoisseur about the per- 
formance of her telephone and loved 
it best of all her instruments. 

“I saw that,” said Mark, just to 
keep her on her toes. 

“I was only turning up the yel- 
low,” said Marylou. “It was a little 
low. That’s all.” 

“You’re a liar. You wanted to 
show off your pretty yellow hair.” 

Maryiou pouted a little. “Just be- 
cause you’re being so tiresome this 
morning I’ll tell you now why I 
called you.” 

“Oh, God, no! You couldn’t do 
that,” he said from under the show- 
er. “Not before breakfast.” 

“You’ve got no time for breakfast. 
It’s sim-0545 now. At sim-0615

“Oh, boy. Oh, boy,” he moaned.

have to happen in the middle of the 
sim-night?” 

“Colonel’s orders, Marco. He says 
a summary trial will impress the na- 
tives.” 



T he colonel of Transit Station 
J was Colonel Prince Banerji 
of Haipur, and his ideas of discipline 
were inherited from an ancestor who 
once personally beheaded 409 Eng- 
lish people, including 14 women and 
27 children, back in his home state 
of Haipur on his home planet Earth, 
because he thought the English resi- 
dents were becoming insubordinate. 
When the British soldiers came to 
take vengeance he told them that 
he had been no more severe with 
their late compatriots than he would 
be with his own people, and this 
was doubtless true. 

His descendant carried on the 
tradition by such endearing maneu- 
vers as holding the monthly Emer- 
gency Evacuation Drill at sim- 
1100, the morning hour that is 
consecrated throughout the civilized 
universe to a pull at the Venusian 
drug-weed and a cup of coffee. 
“Constant and Effortful Vigilance,” 
was his motto for his Transit Sta- 
tion. It was rumored that he never 
slept. Nobody had ever called him 
on the telephone without finding 
him immaculately uniformed and 
sitting at his desk. 

It was clear to Mark that he had 
been picked for the Station’s most 
unpleasant job this sim-morning, 
probably for some good reason like 
Banerji had seen him smile or heard 
him whistle the sim-day before. The 
Station’s most unpleasant job, of 
course, was sitting in on trials. Every 
Earthman on the Station, from the 
colonel to Roderick MacMack, the 
junior engineer, and Mark Hassall, 
the junior transport controller, held 
a commissioned rank in the Space

Police, and under the terms of the 
Re-Foundation of Government in 
2085, an officer in the Space Police 
had to be ready and trained to act 
the role of congressman, detective, 
judge, lawyer or jailer on demand. 

This happy sim-morning Mark 
Hassall had been chosen for judge. 
Standing Orders said that every dis- 
pute on the Station must be attend- 
ed by an Earth officer. This Order 
meant, for instance, that Mark had 
once been forced to sit for 14 sim- 
hours in total silence alone in the 
courtroom with two tankfuls of Al- 
deberan-4 creatures while they 
thrashed out what they alleged was 
a theological dispute. The Aids are 
the interpreters of the universe, and 
they had said that the subject mat- 
ter of therr dispute was ineffable. 
“And if ineffable,” they added, “then 
untranslatable.” Mark hadn’t even 
dared peruse a novel, for though 
no one but Aids could tell when Aids 
were having a break, the colonel, if 
he cared to look in, would know if 
Mark was. 

“This isn’t my lucky sim-day,” said 
Mark to Marylou while he brushed 
his teeth. 

“It could be much worse, friend,” 
said the delectable communicator. 
“It’s only an intra-species affair.” 

In those days the difference be- 
tween intra-Species law and inter- 
species law really meant something. 
Intra-Secies litigation was purga- 
torial, but inter-species litigation was 
hellish. In those days all cases were 
technically settled by Earth law, and 
in every judgment the judge had to 
produce a complicated formula rec- 
onciling his Earth-derived set- 



tlement with the law and practice of 
the relevant alien race. If two alien 
races were involved in a dispute, 
then the unhappy magistrate had to 
wrestle with a three-way compro- 
mise. 

With some sense of relief Mark 
turned on the visuals and gave 
Marylou a sight of his shining morn- 
ing face. 

“What’s the rap?” he asked, air- 
ing a bit of jargon he had picked up 
watching old television films in the 
Station library. (The Station had 
half a million books, many of them 
genuine antiques like the “Perry Ma- 
son” series he was quoting from.) 

“Wait for it,” said Marylou ro- 
guishly, and brightened the contrast 
control to show off her roguish dim- 
ples. “Wife beating.” 

“Oh, for God’s sake! Only a tenth 
of them have arms to beat with! 
And only a tenth of them have 
wives.” 

“Well, one in a hundred’s a wife- 
beater.” 

“I’ve heard it all. What could be 
next?” 

“It Could Be You, Mark darling,” 
said Marylou. 

“Kindly remember your place,” he 
said with mock roughness, and 
leaned forward as unobtrusively as 
he could in order to turn down the 
red register. “The Court at sim- 
0615 then.” 

“Good luck, Marco,” said the Sta- 
tion’s sole communications expert 
and sole Earth woman, and switched 
off. 

“Thank you, honeychile,” said 
Mark meditatively into the gray 
screen. “Thank you.”

IF 




■fT^hen he got to the courtroom 
and took his place on the Tri- 
bunal the trial was already set up. 
Beside him on the table was his 
water carafe, and about a quart of 
the Station’s complement of Aldeb- 
eran-4 people in their aquarium-like 
traveling quarters, with earphone 
pickups already connected, Mark 
put on the earphones. 

“Good morning, sir,” said an elec- 
tronically produced voice. “This is 
the Court Interpreter.” 

“Good morning. Aids,” he said. 
“Miss Marylou said to tell you 
that your container of body-fluid in- 
cludes a toxic additive.” 

Mark looked inside the vacuum 
flask which held water for the Judge 
and found it full of steaming black 
coffee. 

“Thank you, Aids. Convey my 
thanks to Miss Marylou. Sorry to see 
so many of you here this morning.” 
The Aids made no answer. About 
two-thirds of the Station’s comple- 
ment of Aids had turned up that sim- 
morning. They always sent to court 
just as many individuals as could 
cope with the complexity of the case 
as they saw it. They seldom mis- 
judged. To see so many of them at 
once was a bad omen. 

He looked around the Court. Be- 
low him, in what they called the 
dock, were two bedraggled Fomal- 
haut-9s, one male, one female. He 
had no idea what the female Fomal- 
haut was doing there. The only 
wheeled race known at the time, 
they were circling round each other 
in the gyration labeled by the Eth- 
ological Handbook for their race 
“Repose: without joy”, and which 



MacMack had rechristened “con- 
stant and effortful vigilance” after 
the tyrannous Banerji’s watchword. 
Beyond them, in the position tech- 
nically known as “Counsel for the 
Defense” was the Station’s senior 
lieutenant, Gil Mulrooney, a thick- 
set, grizzled veteran of the Last 
Trans-Stellar War. Beside him sat 
his opposite number, counsel for the 
prosecution, in the person of the 
Station’s dapper Administrative Ad- 
jutant, Jules Monterey. 

The titles they bore for the oc- 
casion dated from a time when the 
government was divided into many 
separate departments — like ju- 
diciary, administration, police, army 
or the Bar. But by the end of the 
21st century, government was gov- 
ernment and no longer a species of 
public debate or carnival tug-of-war, 
and any government officer could 
take any role. The two counsels’ 
jobs were roughly to list the points 
on two opposing sides, and Mark’s 
was to pronounce judgment. 

But all government is of course 
implicit in each individual. Next 
time they would probably trade jobs. 

Beyond the court itself ranged the 
tiered compartments reserved for 
spectators. Each compartment was 
adapted to the physique of one of 
the 25 trans-stellar races living on 
the Station, with the front row re- 
served for Earthmen and Martians, 
whose solar system the Station hap- 
pened to be in. Most of the com- 
partments had someone inside. It 
looked to Mark as if an average 
number of every race had come to 
see the fun. You had to say “aver- 
age” because the actual number of 



LONO DAY IN COURT 



55 




individuals of any race which con- 
stituted a quorum varied so much. 
For instance there was a quart of 
Aids on his desk: that would be 
around 150,000,000 individuals. 
There were around 400 Loon-birds 
sparsely roosting in their three-di- 
mensional knitting safely (of 
course) behind glass. There were 
three Earthmen in the court, all in 
official capacities. There was one 
Leprechaun with his eye extruded. 
And, luckily, there was no Phoenix- 
cloud within a billion miles of the 
Station. There is only one Phoenix- 
cloud known, but that one can be 
dangerous enough to a lonely Tran- 
sit Station. 

It is the job of a Station to offer 
shelter and to offer sustenance — 
but not if the first bite is the Sta- 
tion itself. 

“Thanks be for small mercies, 
anyway,’* thought Mark. Aloud he 
said, “We’ll begin.” 

O n the recording strip sunk in- 
to the desk at the right of his 
chair he saw the words “The Court 
sits” appear. This was also the work 
of the Aids, who activated the offi- 
cial court record. The difference be- 
tween languages and the difference 
between two styles in one language 
were both the same difference to 
them. So far as they knew it was all 
translation. So whatever one said in 
court ki English was minced up by 
their infallible brain-circuitry and 
emerged on the record in the sort 
of legal jargon with which lawyers 
have baffled laymen since the inven- 
tion of justice. 

All round the court bodies relaxed 



in the way appropriate to their phy- 
sique. 

“What gives in this case?” said 
Mark. 

“Set forth the Plaint,” said the rec- 
ord. 

Gil Mulrooney got up slowly. 
“That’s not hard,” he said. “I was on 
Station watch this sim-morning. At 
sim-0149 I got a call from the 
automatic monitor on 9th level, at 
the intersection of the Fomalhaut 
avenue and 12th Freeway, a call 
of ‘believed disturbance’. I immed- 
iately went down by chute in per- 
son.” 

“Leaving the watch monitor ac- 
tive in the guardroom,” Mark put in. 

“Of course,” said Gil. “Activating 
the watch monitor.” This would look 
right in the record. It wasn’t that 
Mark doubted that Gil had taken 
this simple precaution, just that he 
might have forgotten to say so. It 
was Mark’s job to keep the record 
straight and, more than that, to keep 
the colonel sweet. 

“Go on,” said Mark. 

“The corridor monitor was quite 
correct. There was considerable dis- 
turbance coming from cell 34 on 
the Fomalhaut avenue, the cell as- 
signed to Mr. and Mrs. Daap-daap. I 
could hear great clouts against the 
partition wall and a squealing that 
could be heard four blocks away. I 
thought at least a band of loon-birds 
had got loose in there.” 

Mark shuddered at the picture. 
“Sounds bad. What did you do 
then?” 

“I activated the calling circuits 
and I was let in.” 

“Immediately? You made me 

IF 



56 




think all Hell was let loose in there.” 

‘Well, it calmed down the mo- 
ment I keyed the calling circuit. Al- 
most as if they’d been waiting for 
me. 

“That doesn’t sound very likely,” 
said Mark, “if the noise was as bad 
as you say.” 

“The noise was very bad,” said 
Mulrooney grimacing “One 
wouldn’t be mistaken about a noise 
like that.” 

“Well, it was a sleep-period,” said 
Monterey from the other counsel’s 
box. 

“I don’t see the relevance,” said 
Mulrooney slowly. “The Fomalhauts 
don’t sleep. You know that.” 

“I do,” said Monterey, conscien- 
tiously needling his opposite number 
as a good Counsel should. “But 
Earthmen do sleep. I call the judge’s 
attention to that.” 

“You’re claiming I dreamt it 
then,” shouted Mulrooney furiously. 

“You were probably as bleary as 
a gigolo on Sunday morning,” an- 
swered Monterey. 

T he record paused for a few 
seconds, then produced this im- 
partial translation. “I submit that 
Lieutenant Mulrooney was suffering 
from disorientation of the reality- 
sense brought on by cultural shock, 
the cultural shock being due in this 
case to his foregoing a fundamental 
Earth custom, namely that of under- 
going a period of unconsciousness 
between sim-0001 and sim-0801.” 
“Nonsense,” said Mark hurriedly. 
“Gil’s a policeman, for God’s sake.” 
The Aids printed: “Objection for- 
mally noted. The judgment of this 



court in this is that, firstly, the Earth 
race is exceptionally immune to cul- 
tural shock, and, secondly, vigilance 
during the sleep-period is an old and 
honored custom of the Earth police 
subculture and would thus be entire- 
ly natural to Lieutenant ^Mul- 
rooney.” It looked damn good. 

“This is all off the point,” said 
Mark. “Whatever interpretation we 
may put upon it, the court accepts 
that the Fomalhauts in question 
stopped quarreling and let you in. 
Then what?” 

“On gaining entrance I found the 
defendant, Fomalhaut-male Daap- 
daap, holding in one tentacle a 
carved Fomalhaut food-pipe some 
90 cms long (Exhibit A), and the co- 
defendant Fomalhaut-female Mrs. 
Daap-daap — ” 

“Oh, for God’s sake!” said Mark, 
interrupting. “(Strike that from the 
Record.) I thought this was a wife- 
beating case. Tell me whose wife was 
beaten, and if Mrs. Daap-daap was 
the victim, why does she appear as 
co-defendant? Or isn’t that Fomal- 
haut-female down there Mrs. Daap- 
daap?” 

“Well, Mrs. Daap-daap did get 
beaten,” said Gil. “And she appears 
as co-defendant at her own request. 
And that is her in the dock. To tell 
the truth, this case is a daddy-o.” 

“Certain features of this case ren- 
der it unusually complex,” typed the 
Record. 

“Yes, but is anybody going to ex- 
plain it to me?” said Mark. 

“Honestly, I’d rather you thrash 
it out with the defendants them- 
selves. This court’s already too full 
of mouthpieces.” And Mulrooney 



LONG DAY IN COURT 



57 




favored the tank of Aids with a 
mournful Bronx cheer, which they 
forebore, as near as Mark could see, 
to translate. “1 talked with both 
Daap-daaps, of course, and the facts 
are clear enough, but I haven’t the 
faintest idea what their plea is.” 

“I’ll confirm that. Judge,” said 
Monterey. “Will you take over?” 

“Right,” said Mark. “Don’t go to 
sleep, though.” 

Mulrooney glared at him, but the 
tactful Aids cut out the sleep meta- 
phor and confined their Record to, 
“Maintain, however, general surveil- 
lance, Counsels.” Mark signed to the 
two Fomalhauts to hook themselves 
to the direct Interpreter’s Link. 

He addressed Mrs. Daap-daap. “I 
see that your front wheel is gravely 
contused, to the extent that you are 
resting it on a surgical trolley. Is that 
the result of a fight this sim-morn- 
ing?” 

“Yes, sir,” came the reply. 

“Witness?” said Mark. 

“Deposition of doctor,” said the 
Aids, acting as his remembrancer. 
“Exhibit B.” 

They were right as usual. Mark 
found the document in one of the 
slits under the Record. Its signer 
was an Asclepiad, amid-qravity race 
with a speciality in biophysics, who 
had been the Galaxy’s doctors long 
before Man dame on the scene. It 
certified that when he attended Mrs. 
Daap-daap at 0310 that morning 
she had been suffering from wide- 
spread surface contusions, and from 
a fractured bearing-joint in her front 
ankle — all caused within 2 sim- 
hours of the treatment time. 

Mark addressed Mr. Daap-daap. 



“Did you do this to your wife?” he 
asked. 

“I did,” he answered. He evident- 
ly did not want to hide it, for the 
Aids on the Record had added “(Re- 
laxedly; without hesitation)”. 

“Well, that’s frank. And why did 
you hit her?” 

“Because I did wrong.” 

“And why should you hit her when 
you do wrong?” 

“Because it is the duty of wives to 
suffer punishment for w^iat their 
husbands do wrong.” 

“I see. But why is she too in the 
dock?” 

“Because it is the duty of wives to 
suffer punishment for what their 
husbands do wrong.” 

To the Aids, Mark said, “Come 
on. You’re a question behind. I’m 
asking now why Mrs. Daap-daap is 
in the dock.” 

“Unquote,” said the Aids to show 
they were talking in their, or its, 
proper person. “The defendant’s 
answer was as it appears in the Rec- 
ord.” 

“But that can’t be the answer to 
both questions!” Mark protested. 

“Unquote is that a statement or 
a question? To the defendants or to 
the interpreter?” 

“Well, don’t let’s waste breath,” 
said Mark, knowing that the Aids 
enjoyed a good idiom. “If you know 
the answer, you tell.” 

“Unquote I know why the defend- 
ant’s wife is in the dock. You will 
remember that the reason is in the 
Fomalhaut Ethology Handbook par- 
agraph 975.” (The Aids, being the 
only purely intellectual life form in 
the universe, could never conceive 



58 



IF 




the difference between a memory 
and a reference book. They meant 
Mark could look the information up 
in the Fomalhaut Ethology. The ad- 
vantage of their ignorance was that 
the colonel would never know that 
Mark hadn’t remembered the infor- 
mation for himself, because the par- 
agraph number would merely ap- 
pear in the Aids’ record as a ref- 
erence.) 

M ark flipped over the pages 
of the Ethology. Para 975 
was in Part II (“Social Behavior”), 
Chapter 17 (“Justice”), item 9a 
(“Punishment”). It said: 

“Punishment for wrong-doing is 
customarily inflicted on the fe- 
males — wife, or, if unavailable, 
mother, or, if unavailable, fe- 
male guardian. The accepted 
forms of punishment are phys- 
ical chastisement or deprival of 
nutriment (see paras 304-356) 

— both these can be inflicted by 
Earth officials — and deprival 
of Joy see (para 2) — which can- 
not.” 

“Joy” was obviously pretty basic, 
judging by its, paragraph number, but 
this wasn’t the time for looking it 
up. 

“I’ve got that sewn up, Aids,” said 
Mark, laying the idioms on thick to 
gain time. “I’m right in there with 
you regarding why Daap-daap’s little 
girl is in the dock. Now you give 
with the info why he was hitting her 
this sim-morning.” 

“Roger,” said the Aids, never at a 
loss how to beat interlocutors at 



their own game. “Can do, skipper. 
He was beating her then ’cos he just 
dun wrong. You will remember the 
same para.” 

“I see that,” said Mark. “That ex- 
plains why he was beating her, and 
the note on methods of punishment 
explains why he was beating her,-but 
I still don’t know why he was beat- 
ing her.” 

There was a pause, and then the 
Aids produced another line on the 
Record. It said: “Defendant: Because 
I had done wrong according to 
Earth code. My wife must suffer 
punishment for that.” 

“I see,” said Mark. Daap-daap 
was of course technically quite right. 
Transit Station J had its legal exist- 
ence under an archaic type of agree- 
ment known as a “lease”. This mean 
basically that under a reciprocal 
benefit agreement drawn up accord- 
ing to the law of Jupiter (in whose 
orbit the Station hung) the Earth 
Government controlled the area 
covered by the Station’s orbit. The 
agreement specifically added that 
unless 17 sim-months (a Jupiter 
time-span) notice were given to the 
contrary. Earth law should be ob- 
served by all organic matter aboard. 

So much was true enough. But 
there were some Earth laws which 
some organic matter simply had to 
break, particularly (he glanced wry- 
ly at the 400 or so Loon-birds — 
by God, there were now about a 
thousand of them — swarming in 
the Spectators’ area) the organic 
matter aboard his Station. And in 
their setup an individual could make 
trouble quicker by citing the letter 
of the law than any other way short 



tONO DAY IN COURT 



59 




of opening both doors of the air- 
lock simultaneously. With something 
like anxiety in the corner of his 
mind, he said, “And what Earth law 
did you break?” 

“A law concerning Grievous Bod- 
ily Harm and Assault. I was beating 
my wife.” 

“You acted quite rightly. That sort 
of thing could land you up in the 
courts,” said Mark judiciously. 

“It has landed me up in court,” 
said Daap-daap — “(sternly)”, ac- 
cording to the Record. “And my 
wife has already paid the penalty.” 



F or a couple of heartbeats Mark 
spun dizzily in the no-space of 
the Fomalhauts’ moral metaphysics. 
Then he was back in command. 
“This is the situation, then,” he said 
(“sternly”) No organic mat- 
ter, wheeled or otherwise, in the 
Station would fool him. “You admit 
to beating your wife, and recognize 
that this is illegal under Earth law. 
Your defense against the charge of 
Assault is Justification within Ra- 
cial Mores, and within your code of 
mores the justification is that your 
act of Assault was a legitimate pun- 
ishment for a wrong which you had 
committed, or, at least, for an act 
which was illegal according to the 
laws of your domicile place; that 
wrong being* that same act of As- 
sault. The situation so far is simple.” 
(He would show them who was 
master.) “However, your explan- 
ation is unsatisfactory in this parti- 
cular, that under Earth law punish- 
ment may not be inflicted before 
the crime is committed. Therefore 



the same act cannot be both crime 
and punishment.” 

“We deny that punishment was in- 
flicted before the crime was com- 
mitted. Nor was it inflicted after- 
wards. It was simultaneous.” 

“Oh. I see.” 

“Is our reasoning satisfactory? 
Did we do right in doing what we 
did? Will you acquit us?” 

“The court will adjourn for sim- 
60-minutes to consider judgment.” 
The human beings in .the Court 
stood up. The Fomalhauts formed 
themselves into the Obeisance Pat- 
tern and the Loon-birds — there 
were now thousands of them in 
their sealed cubicle — rose in . a 
humming cloud. Mark stepped swift- 
ly round the back of his Tribunal 
and closed behind him the door of 
the small robing-room. He found 
his hands shaking as he sat at the 
bare desk in the small robing-room, 
and hje suddenly realized that the 
trial had started a whole row of 
alarm bells shrieking in his mind. 

Analyzing what those alarm bells 
were, he came first and inevitably to 
the thought of the colonel. Every- 
one in the Station knew from exper- 
ience what the colonel’s repayment 
for a clumsy judgment could be — 
something nasty, like a tour of the 
exit vents of the air system, or a 
patrol in the high-grav sector. But 
the colonel, though savage, was fair. 
Mark was pretty sure he had done 
as well so far as could be expected. 
Anyway, there wasn’t a moment of 
the sim-day when he wasn’t scared 
of Banerji. 

The next thought he came to was 
“put-up job”. The story of how they 



60 



IF 




had stopped fighting the moment 
Mulrooney called them was suspic- 
ious enough. And then there was no 
denying that they had him pretty 
well tied up. He could acquit them 
by accepting a plea of justification. 
But if Daap-daap was to be excused 
for hitting his wife, then he had 
done no wrong — and justification 
no longer applied. For how could 
he justifiably be hitting his wife if 
he had nothing for which to punish 
her? You get in the same mess, only 
the other way round, Mark thought, 
if you find them guilty. He was fa- 
miliar with such paradoxes on pa- 
per, but he was very unhappy in- 
deed to meet one in the flesh. 

His last thought, the worst of all, 
was, “This isn’t just a Fomalhaut 
family quarrel. The whole Station’s 
in on this.” 

The spectators’ benches had been 
filling up ever since the start of the 
trial. Reviewing in his mind’s eye 
the patchwork of color which had 
been his view from the Tribunal, he 
came to the conclusion that every 
race in the mid-grav sector had sent 
at least one representative. For that 
matter, all the Loon-birds in the 
Station were in there — the Loon- 
birds, the emo,tional carrion-eaters 
of the universe who congregated 
wherever there was trouble, the 
Loon-birds whom the Earth govern- 
ment employed as military person- 
nel only. It was a bad omen when 
Loon-birds gathered. But one cor- 
ner of his mental view-screen was 
blank. Which race might have been 
there but wasn’t? 

Of course. He knew which: the 
Murrays. 



A few of them often came to 
court, particularly to hear a family 
quarrel. None had come today. If 
he could locate the blind spot in the 
Murrays’ psychology which had kept 
them away today, he would have an 
insight into the real nature of ^to- 
day’s case, and into what it meant to 
the inhabitants of the Station. For 
they had mostly known each other 
long before they had known Man, 
and they hadn’t gotten the habit of 
confiding in Man. 

H e called up the Aids (who 
have no hates or loves, no 
prejudices or dislikes — just intel- 
lect). “What’s with the Murrays?” 
“You will remember the Murray 
Ethology para 4. They are the only 
known life-form parasitic on an ob- 
ject smaller than themselves.” 

“No. Try again.” 

“You will remember page xiv of 
the Introduction. They were discov- 
ered by Arthur Murray, later one of 
the victims of the sensational Heat- 
death Murders.” 

“No, no. Something to do with 
this case.” 

“How will you not remember 
paras 112-117? Surely those pages 
of your memory are not miss- 
ing? They deal with the control of 
Murray behavior. Murrays cannot 
be taught to do anything except 
those actions specified in the Ethol- 
ogy, nor can they be prevented in 
any way from doing those actions 
if the appropriate signal has been 
given. Thus their behavior fails com- 
pletely to be plastic, and thus they 
have not the conception of wrong, 
guilt, punishment or law.” 



LONG DAY IN COURT 



61 




All trials deal implicitly with 
wrong, guilt, punishment and law, 
and the fact that the Murrays had 
stayed away showed that these were 
not just implicit in this case but ex- 
plicit. No point of conduct was on 
trial; the system itself was on trial. 
This was a testcase to decide if 
Earth law should continue to hold 
on the Station. It was as if one were 
to feed a certain problem into a 
computer, not to get an answer but 
to test the computer. Only this prob- 
lem, he was pretty sure, included a 
proposition which damaged the 
computer itself. 

In the ordinary course of things, 
if a trial starts going sour you con- 
sult the law further until gradually 
the tangle comes clear. But in this 
case the very statement of the 
charge and the defense tampered 
with the structure of the law itself. 
Any further recourse to the same 
machine could only sent it into a 
positive feedback, which at each 
cycle would take it further into ab- 
surdity. 

There was, of course, Mark re- 
flected, one further technique he 
could use if native wit could not 
sort out the Fomalhauts’ disingenous 
pleas. He could go above the law, 
to the mechanism designed for deal- 
ing with treason, to that body of 
brutal fact known as “martial law.” 
But was he a‘ Banerji, who would 
force a decision by merciless insis- 
tence instead of trying reasonable 
discussion? All the same he called 
the Aids, and together they refresh- 
ed his memory on the use of extra- 
legal coercion in settling disputes. 
And he began to run over in his 



mind, not the Perry Mason series 
but the equally old and famous 
Mickey Spillane adventures. 

When the hour was up Mark took 
his place with as much calmness as 
he could. 

“Trial resumes,” he said. The au- 
dience settled back into their seats, 
perches, hovering-heights or float- 
ing-depths. “Have the principals any- 
thing further to say before judg- 
ment be delivered?” 

“We wish the charge set aside,” 
said the Fomalhauts. “We have been 
mistaken on a point of law and a 
point of ethics.” 

Mark heaved a secret sigh. “We 
are glad that you should agree,” he 
answered in a satisfactorily judicious 
tone. “What is the cause of your 
change of mind?” 

“We have a custonl, one custom 
only, that corresponds to your ‘law*. 
It is this: ‘To each and from each 
according as he is*. This is the whole 
of our law. For instance, it is right 
for a Fomalhaut being to obey Fo- 
malhaut custom; for an Earth be- 
ing to obey Earth custom. Thus for 
us there exist many versions of 
‘right*. There is Earth ‘right’, there 
is Fomalhaut ‘right’, there is Aldebe- 
ran ‘right’ and so on.” Mark nodded 
happily. “Now, it is Fomalhaut-right 
for a Fomalhaut to obey Fomalhaut 
custom. It is Fomalhaut-right for an 
Earth man to obey Earth custom. 
But here we are troubled. For it is 
no part ot Fomalhaut-right to de- 
termine the right of Earth according 
to Fomalhaut thinking. Thus in no 
way may we who are Fomalhauts 
either approve or disapprove the 
workings of an Earth court. All talk 



62 



If 




of justice here is meaningless. We 
will withdraw now.” 

Then the truth was on the table. 
Not only was the problem one to 
break the machine, but it said right 
there in the packet, “This problem 
breaks the machine.” 

He felt a prickle of apprehension 
run down his spine, for he observed 
the Fomalhauts in the dock and in 
the spectators’ benches melting and 
weaving into the hollow square of 
Active Hostility. 

CiV^ait a minute before you go,” 
^^he said, smiling. Heck, he 
thought, this is insane. Surely if he 
could only think on his feet long 
enough he could solve this whole ab- 
surd problem. If this sordid family 
bickering was the revolt flag of half 
a universe, then this was a universe 
populated solely by dumb blonde 
mothers-in-law and vicars in the 
wood. He started talking. “Can we 
be sure there is a case to answer 
here? I mean, beating one’s wife is 
one of the few honest and innocent 
pleasures in this over-civilized uni- 
verse, and I imagine beating one’s 
husband is too. And if this pastime 
may not be innocently indulged in, 
what do we all go through marriage 
for?” 

Surprisingly, the Aids said in his 
ear, “Is that a joke?” 

“I suppose it is.” 

“A moment, please. Jokes take a 
little longer.” Mark paused. He had 
taught the Station Aids to have a 
sense of humor because he liked to 
have someone around to construct 
new stories for him to tell — bi- 
zarre as the Aids’ jokes usually 



were. And he had been most grati- 
fied to discover from them — prob- 
ably the first Earth man to do so-^ 
that most of the trans-stellars had 
an analogue of a sense of humor too. 
So presumably the Aids meant to 
amuse the whole Station with his 
feeble quip. They might welf have 
a tough time, for the races which 
composed the audience had no fixed 
sexual organization which would 
make such a joke comprehensible. 
There were examples in front of him 
of gyniphagy (wife-eating) and of 
metazygy - with - stomach - sharing 
(sexual union of Siamese twins) and 
of endosomatogamy (where an indi-| 
vidual chooses his mate not merely - 
from within his own tribe but from 
among the cells of his own body) 
and many others. 

There was a silence. Then appar- 
ently the Aids said something to the 
Asclepiad group, and they answered. 
Then the Aids spoke simultaneously 
to every group in the room. 

With a lift of the heart Mark re- 
alized that his job was done. Like 
the wind over a plain of grass a 
change ran over the room. The 
Loon-birds empurpled, whistled with 
disappointment and zipped out 
through their ventilator. The Wood- 
weevils swallowed each other up un- 
til they had re-assembled their single 
persona. The Leprechaun opened its 
eye, drew its ear down into it, closed 
the eye on the ear and shut them 
both in its mouth. All round the 
room it was the same. Everyone 
reckoned the case was happily re- 
solved. Even the original culprits, or 
plaintiffs, (whichever they were) 
the Fomalhauts, who before had 



LONG DAY IN COURT 



63 




sulked over the wrong they had suf- 
fered or been detected in inflicting 
(whichever it was), relaxed their 
hollow square into the interlocking 
circle of Quiet Pleasure. 

A soft answer turneth indeed 
away wrath, thought Mark. Aloud 
he said: 

“Okay, that’s it.” 

The Record printed: “Court ad- 
journs sine die.” 

Mark sat watching the assembled 
creatures leave in their own way. 
When they were gone he said confi- 
dentially to the Aids, “How did you 
do it?” 

“It was nothing,” answered the 
Aids. “I made to each group the 
same basic suggestion, that, if per- 
formed with a life-partner (and I use 
the word in a punning sense, indi- 
cating thereby both cohabitors and 
commensals), actions which normal- 
ly produce aversive stimuli actually 
produce reinforcing ones. And, with 
the permission of the Asclepiads, I 
cited certain contusions and abra- 
sions for which they had to treat 
Miss Marylou.” 

Mark was appalled. After a mo- 
ment he asked, “And that wouldn’t 
be a joke if something about some- 
one and Miss Marylou wasn’t sup- 
posed to be a secret?” 

“No, sir.” 

“You know, you’ll end on the gal- 
lows.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“A joke’s hardly a joke if it’s a 
joke on you, is it?” 

“We wouldn’t care to answer that, 
sir.” 

“Good morning to you, then. 
Thank you for your help.” 



B ack in his quarters, Mark changed 
his shirt and reflected grim- 
ly that the whole trial, including the 
Aids’ version of a joke, would be on 
the Record, and the Record would 
very likely be at this moment in the 
colonel’s hands. The now menacing 
tones of Earth Is Where My 
Heart Is interrupted his gloomy mu- 
sings. 

Marylou appeared on the tele- 
phone. “Get your tie straight!” she 
shouted without preamble: “You’re 
to see the colonel.” 

“Oh, boy. Heap big trouble. This 
paleface is up the totem for sure 
this time.” 

“This is no time for joking,” she 
shouted agonizedly. “This is real 
trouble. He wants to see you in per- 
sonV* 

She knew what she was talking 
about. The last time the colonel 
had met anyone officially in person 
was at the trial of an Earth man for 
murder — at his execution. 

“Man, I’m gone!” shouted Mark, 
and ran down the corridor towards 
the colonel’s office, buttoning his 
cuffs as he went. He knocked once 
and heard the colonel’s “Come in” 
before he dropped his hand. 

Inside the colonel sat at his desk, 
hard, strong, young-looking and 
ruthlessly efficient as he had often 
appeared on the telephone. His 
smooth coppery face was set as 
usual in an unrelenting expression of 
contemptuous dislike. 

“Sit down, Mark. I won’t hurt 
you,” he said surprisingly. 

Mark did so. 

“Look, Mark, this is my last 
command. 1 shaU never make the

little hop back to Earth and to my 
own country, let alone see other 
countries on other stars as you will. 
Why? Because I’m old. Not in ap- 
pearance, perhaps. But inside each 
cell totes up its own time-reckoning 
and there’s nothing we can do to put 
the clock back. If you want to know 
the truth, this body’s 103 years old. 
But I’m skillful at my job, and my 
job is to command you. And part of 
my skill is in knowing how to look 
when I command. You rarely see 
me. You know that. But do you 
know that when I telephone you, the 
words are mine but the speaker is 
an electronic face-voice simulacrum 
cooked up by Marylou? And when 
I have to appear in person I spend 
half a day down in the Asclepiads’ 
stinking surgery, where the walls are 
lined with the pickled limbs of half 
the creatures of the galaxy and 
where the death-tubes are loaded 
with the day’s quota? For in the 
morning I wake an old man, and no- 
one may see me until my physician 
has remade me as the beautiful and 
terrible Indian prince. I’ll show you 
something.” 

Banerji leant forward and slowly 
unbuttoned his creaseless tunic. In- 
side Mark saw with a sudden sick 
horror that it was thickly and art- 
fully padded. Underneath, his chest 
was the chest of an old man. Sharp 
edges of bone seemed ready to 
pierce the dry, wrinkled skin, and be- 
low his immaculate neckline the sur- 
face of his body was an ugly patch- 
work of brown and purple and fun- 
goid white. 

“Now you know,” said Banerji in 
his uncannily youthful voice. “And 



now I think you will understand that 
this Station is maintained and kept 
in order not by any mass of rules 
in a rulebook but by personal com- 
mand. And that command is exer- 
cised by me. By my commanding 
words and by my commanding 
body. I am telling you this so that 
you will understand what you did 
today. You exercised command as I 
would do. Not perhaps in the way 
I would have done, but choosing 
your own method, imposing order 
on disorder, bringing submission out 
of revolt.” 

“Why do you tell me this, sir?” 
asked Mark. 

“Because soon I shall go to my 
fathers, and you will go to take up 
a command of your own. And for 
that reason you must learn every- 
thing I have to teach.” 

M ark was honestly proud that 
the colonel should thus treat 
him as an equal, but secretly he pro- 
tested that he would never have to 
act the slave-driver in front of his 
own crew. 

“You are smiling now,” said Ban- 
erji, “because you know that you will 
never have to use the proud airs 
and sordid subterfuges that I use. 
But I leave you with one thought. 
Your genius for command comes 
out in an admirably frank comrade- 
liness, in a charming and self-dep- 
recating gift of humor. It is the gift 
of your American heritage. But if 
as time goes on and your responsi- 
bility for the Government of your 
fellow beings becomes ever wider 
and greater, sometimes, in the pri- 
vacy of your quarters, you need to 



LONG DAY IN COURT 



65 




practice and rehearse your charming- 
ly spontaneous good humor — then 
do not be ashamed.” 

They sat for many moments in 
silence, and then the Indian said, 
“Back to your duties. Lieutenant. 
Constant and effortful vigilance.” 

“Contsant and effortful vigilance, 
sir.” Mark snapped and was gone. 

Back in his office he switched on 
the Aids. 

“Aids,” he said in a phoney Aus- 
tralian accent. “You tell black-fel- 
low Fomalhaut that white man sav- 
vy good-good make black fellow 
and black - fellow - woman chum- 
chum.” 

After a pause the adaptable Aids 
whined back, “Fair dinkum, cob- 
ber.” 



“Cheerioh, old matey,” said Mark, 
and switched to Marylou’s channel. 
“Hiya handsome,” he breathed in- 
timately. “How about I take you 
over to the Mess and we stop all 
this Deprival of Joy?” 

Her face lit up. “Sure thing. Mar- 
co-boy. As soon as you like.” 

“Five sim-minutes, then,” he said 
and grinned boyishly at her. As she 
faded he buried his face in his hands. 
When you took up government, he 
thought, you take up a load as 
massy as the galaxy itself. He felt 
a thousand years old. 

But if that crazy old wreck Ban- 
erji can take it, so can Mark H assail! 

He got up, loosened his tie, tous- 
led his hair and set out whistling 
for the Mess. END

4 4T et us,” says the feller, “eat 

-L' up the street.” 

“Oh no,” says his girl friend, “I 
don’t like asphalt.” 

Which only goes to show how bub- 
ble-headed some guys* girl-friends 
can get, for few substances known to 
man have proved so useful for so 
long. If today the number of uses 
for asphalt is pushing its second 
hundred thousand, it’s only the re- 
sult of an early start and straight 
A’s ever since! 

There seems little doubt that the 
substance which forms the expan- 
sion joints between the concrete slabs 
of a superhighway is the same gunk 
used to coat the basket in which 
Moses was found amongst the bul- 
rushes. The interlining of that paper 
bag you brought your ice cream 
home in yesterday is impregnated 
with much the same glop which wa- 
terproofed the Hanging Gardens of 

GLOP, GOOSH AND GILGAMESH 



Babylon. “6 sars of bitumen I poured 
over its outside; 3 sars I poured over 
its interior,” says the Babylonian 
Epic of Gilgamesh, quoting one 
Noah, noted local ark-builder. 

“Bitumen” once was, and in some 
places still is, a synonym for “as- 
phalt.” The Romans used the for- 
mer as a generic term for all natur- 
al hydrocarbons, for although “petro- 
leum” — literally “rock oil” — is a per- 
fectly sound term, it was not used in 
classical Latin. Up until' fifty years 
ago these hydrocarbons were, com- 
mercially, divided into three main 
groups — natural gas, the liquid petro- 
leum, and asphalt: gas, liquid, solid, 
all neat and convenient The name 
“asphalt” or “asphaltum” comes 
from the Greek: actually it was 
called pissasphaltum, the derivation 
being the same, no kidding, as the 
word “pitch.” 

Ancient references to these sub- 

67 



stances are plentiful and fascinating, 
especially since the stuff has world- 
wide distribution, though of course 
uneven. Not only is it found almost 
everywhere, it occurs throughout the 
whole range of geological strata, 
from the really old Laurentian rocks 
to the most recent Quarternary lay- 
ers. Hence you can match a Bob 
Hope wisecrack about the La Brea 
Tar Pits with Diodorus’s account of 
the Dead Sea asphalt industry, which 
collected the material for shipment 
to Egypt, where it was Used to pre- 
serve the dead. As a matter of fact, 
the Egyptian word “mummy” comes 
from the ancient Persian word 
“mummai” which means nothing else 
in the world but — asphalt. 

I n the King James Bible you’ll find, 
in the account of the construc- 
tion of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 
ix, 3) that “slime had they for mor- 
tar,” and further on {xiv, 10) that 
the vale of Siddim “was full of slime- 
pits.” The Tower, as a boondoggle, 
had a bad enough reputation without 
this kind of slur on the contractors; 
so let’s look at the Vulgate Bible, 
where, sure enough, we find the 
word translated “bitumen” instead 
of “slime” and “slime-pits.” These 
pits figure elsewhere in Genesis. It 
seems there were four kings of the 
Babylonian region who had them- 
selves a war with the five kings of 
the Low Plain of Siddim. As Genesis 
xiv puts it: “Now the Low Plain of 
Siddim was pits upon pits of bitu- 
men; and the kings of Sodom and 
Gomorrah took to flight and went 
falling into them, and those who re- 
mained fled into the mountainous 



region.” And the GFs used to com- 
plain about mud! Anyway, there was 
so much bitumen around the Dead 
Sea, especially the southern tip, that 
the Romans used to call the Sea 
“Lake Asphaltitis.” 

There are “lakes” of asphalt 
which are by no means mere figures 
of speech. The most celebrated of 
these is the one on the island of 
Trinidad. My oldest reference, which 
goes back sixty years, describes it 
as a hair over 99 acres, firm enough 
in most places to support a team of 
horses, though softer in the center. 
A “tramway”, or mine railroad, was 
laid on palm leaves, and the asphalt 
was dug with pick and shovel, down 
to about two feet. In a day or so the 
excavated area would fill up again 
with soft material which hardened 
as it contacted the air. At that time 
they were pulling 130,000 tons an- 
nually, and the owners were paying 
the government a royalty of £10,000 
a year. My most recent reference 
gives the area as 100 acres and says 
it has increased 23 acres in the past 
half-century; you can take your 
choice of the figures, but they’re a 
quibble compared to the monstrous 
amounts that have come out of that 
sticky hole in the ground. The oldest 
estimate I can find for the amount 
ot asphalt in the lake is figured on 
158,400 tons per foot of depth. But 
nobody knows how deep it is. A 
guess of 20 feet (average) would 
mean a reserve of 3,168,000 tons, 
which was the 1910 estimate. Since 
then it has yielded over 7.5 million 
tons and they’re still calling it 100 
acres. Some say it’s 300 feet deep. 
Some say it’s bottomless. 



68 



IF 




There’s a wonderfully consistent 
vagueness throughout the whole sub- 
ject. Asphalt, like political convic- 
tions or science fiction, being a mix- 
ture not a compound, has a wide ar- 
ray of physical (non) constants, like 
specific gravity, melting point and 
solubility. Nobody seems to know 
just how it’s formed, for the best 
guess — that it’s what’s left of a pe- 
troleum deposit after the more 
volatile elements have evapor- 
ated — really explains very little 
about what happens underground 
during the process, nor why, nor 
how come it has happened in so 
many places and times. The require- 
ments would seem to be a very spe- 
cial combination of heat, gases, petro- 
leum and mud, and some long-term 
churning. The result, quantitatively, 
for a representative sample, is about 
0.17 per cent water; 51.87 per cent 
volatile bitumen; 10 per cent sulphur; 
ash, earth and such garbage, 28.30 
per cent; and fixed carbon, 9.72 per 
cent. Chemically it’s about 80 per 
cent carbon, 6 per cent hydrogen, 0.5 
per cent nitrogen, 1.5 oxygen, and 
the rest, around 12 per cent sulphur. 
Some of the sulphur together with 
some of the oxygen and the asphalt, 
especially in the softer parts (like 
the gooshy pool in the center of the 
lake, which is locally called “mother 
of the lake”) gives off considerable 
quantities of sulphur dioxide, a fra- 
grance of rotten eggs. It keeps this 
up for some time after it’s dug. 

A sphalt is now pumped, tanked 
and piped, for it can flow quite 
readily at around 200 degrees. Long 



cooking of a mash like this, how- 
ever, can have frightening results, 
as for example the recent explosion 
of an asphalt tanker on a routine 
Gulf coast run. Nobody knows ex- 
actly what happened, but whatever 
it was, it happened swiftly and with 
great enthusiasm. Nothing was ever 
found of the ship or its* crew but a 
few empty lifebelts and some scorch- 
ed boards. 

Most asphalt, of course — close to 
70 per cent — is used in road mak- 
ing. It’s the tar in tarmac (the mac 
in macadam, a crushed-stone mix) 
and the black in blacktop. The rest 
goes into hundreds of thousands of 
other products and processes. As a 
component in concretes of various 
kinds, it makes wonderful shock- 
proof foundations for hydraulic ham- 
mers, turret-lathes and such muscular 
machinery. It waterproofs swimming 
pools and roofing felt, makes rust- 
preventive paints and lacquers, 
floors, walks and trouble. (My broth- 
er and I, before we had two digits 
to our ages, discovered roofing tar 
as a substitute for bubble gum. We 
sat for hours in the hot sun, just 
chewing. It was the tarred roof we 
sat on. After our pants were pried 
off, we were sent to bed. My broth- 
er still had his cud. During the night 
it fell out of his face and welded his 
hair to the sheet. He couldn’t get un- 
draped until they shaved him bald 
as a bullet. ) Tile-makers couldn’t get 
along without asphalt, nor automo- 
bile manufacturers, nor tree-sur- 
geons. 

Nor could you.

3TEVE RYELAND knew that he was a criminal who had failed the Plan of Man 
but he could not remember his crime, though the iron collar he wore 
around his neck reminded him of it night and day. Chosen by 



THE PLANNER, the great, powerful spokesman for the Planning Machine, to take 
charge of a special research project, Ryeland found himself giving orders to 
generals, colonels, celebrated scientists->who resented it, and showed their re- 
sentment in a thousand ways. It was a puzzling situation. Even more puzzling 
was the project itself, which was simply to develop "a jetless drive^^ — a new 
space- propulsion system which would allow the forces of the Plan of Man to 
expand into the half-mythical bodies that circled the Sun far beyond Pluto. It 
seemed impossible. And yet— there was the spaceling, the queer creature from 
the distant Reefs of Space that itself seemed to have such a drive. Ryeland was 
given the captive spaceling to experiment on, though it was the property of 



DONNA CREERY, the lovely daughter of the Planner, half child and half tem- 
pestuous woman, who would surely find revenge if he harmed the creature that 
w*as her pet. It was a difficult life, and it led to catastrophe . for Rye- 
land's rebellious subordinates founcf a way to discredit him with the Machine, 
and he was ordered off the jetless-drive project and thrown into the Body Bank, 
that scrapheap for waste dtizens and criminals too far gone for salvage, where 
their sole remaining task was to give up the orgons of their bodies to repair 
more useful men and women. It was the end of the tine, there was no doubt 
of it. Yet fate held a still more shattering blow. In the Body Bank Ryeland met 
again 

ANGELA, the girl who had testified against him, the girt who^^ cotiM' tell hbn 
what his crime had been and why he could not remember it. To hir horror, she 
did. Ryeland learned why so much of his memory war shodowy ond cenfvsed . 
for he was not a notural man! He was a '^junk mon^'-— created out of costoff 
parts .and bits of tissue, nothing but a dummy that some more fortunate vidini of 
the Body Bank had contrived as a screen to cover his escape! 

Desperate, Ryeland tried to flee the Body Bank— but he was caught and hurried 
to the Administration Building where someone waited to see him. He did not 
know who; he did not know why. But surely it could not matter any more. 
Nothing worse could happen— he had nothing left, not even a body of his owni

PART III

T ’^hey rushed him through the cor- 
ridors, into a room, left him 
there for a moment; they threw a 
pair of coveralls at him, gave him 
barely time to squirm into them and 
paid no attention to the fact that 
they were four sizes too small. “It 
doesn’t matter where you’re going,” 
rumbled the guard with the white 
tunic and the red heart. “Come 
on!” And they led him to another 
room and once again left him. 

Through an open door Ryeland 
saw an operating theater. 

Thank heaven for meprobomate, 
he thought without emotion, for this 
was undoubtedly the end of the 
trail. The asepsis lights were burn- 
ing over the twin tables; a full Q. R. 
crew was in view behind the trans- 
parent contamination-bar. On one 
table was a man of Ryeland’s ap- 
proximate build, with a great sigh- 
ing bellows box pumping air through 
a complicated nest of piping. A 
lung machine? Yes. And the man, 
Ryeland knew, was about to get 
new lungs. And the lungs would 
have to cOme, of course, from Rye- 
land . 

Or would they? Ryeland was baf- 
fled. For both tables were occupied, 
the one with a cadaver from Heav- 
en as well as the one with a useful 
citizen come to collect a new part. 
It was very queer. 

But it only meant, probably, he 
assured himself, that he would be 
the donor for the next useful part. 
It was not kind of them to make 



him witness the operation, of course. 
But the Plan of Man was only im- 
personally kind. He glanced at the 
scene, looked away, then watched 
with helpless fascination. Faintly he 
could hear the brisk, businesslike 
orders of the surgeon, slitting skin, 
slicing through muscle, sculpting 
bone ... 

The operation was nearly over 
when he heard a sound behind him. 

He turned. 

Donna Creery walked in the door. 

Donna Creery! She looked at him 
as though he were furniture. “Took 
you long enough to get him,” she 
said grumpily to the man behind 
her — chief surgeon of the Clinic, 
by his bearing and his frown. “All 
right. I’ve got this — ” she waved a 
radar gun — “so he won’t give me 
any trouble. Will you, Ryeland?” 

The surgeon said doubtfully, “It’s 
most irregular.” 

“You’ve seen the Machine’s or- 
der,” purred Donna Creery, and 
waved a strip of factape. 

“Oh,” said the surgeon hastily, “of 
course. Miss Creery. You know I 
wouldn’t — But it’s most irregular, 
all the same.” 

Donna nodded coldly and beck- 
oned to Ryeland. “The Machine does 
not have to be regular,” she said. 
“Now show us how to get to my 
rocket.” 

T hey were out of the clinic 
beyond the wall, out to a land- 
ing pit. And there was Donna 
Creery’s rocket speedster, squatting 
on its fins. The girl whispered: “Chi- 
quita!” 

Ryeland said strongly, “Wait a

minute, Miss Creery Where are 
you taking me?” 

She looked at him thoughtfully. 
“I have orders from the Machine,” 
she said after a moment. “They di- 
rect me to take you to another 
Heaven, where you are needed for 
a rush repair job on an important 
member of the Planning staff.” 

“That sounds peculiar,” he pro- 
tested. 

“Oh, very. Chiquita!” The girl 
stamped her foot and glared into the 
ship. 

There was a golden movement in- 
side, then a faint blue luminous 
haze. 

The spaceling floated out. 

Its tawny eyes were fixed wor- 
shipfully on Donna Creery. It 
wriggled felinely in the air, curled, 
spun — in pure joy, it seemed — 
and halted, poised in the air, before 
her. 

Ryeland started to speak. “Shut 
up,” whispered the girl. “There isn’t 
time to argue. You’ve got to get out 
of here before they come to take 
you back.” 

“Back? But why should they do 
that? The travel orders from the Ma- 
chine — ” 

“ — are forged” She met his gaze 
calmly. “Yes. 1 forged them myself, 
so I should know So the surgeon will 
be looking for you, as soon as he 
gets around to filing a routine re- 
port of compliance with the Ma- 
chine. And that will be — what 
would you say? Five minutes?” 

“But I don’t understand!” 

“You don’t have to understand!” 
the girl blazed. “There isn’t timel 
I’m trying to save your life. Also—” 



she hesitated. “Truthfully there’s 
another reason. My father needs 
you.” 

“The Planner? But — but — why 
would he have to forge orders from 
the Machine?” 

“1 can’t tell you now.” She stared 
around. No one was in sight. She 
said grimly, “Heaven help you if 
anything goes wrong. I can’t take 
you in my rocket; there isn’t room. 
Anyway, that’s the first place they’ll 
look. I don’t think they’ll bother 
me. But if you’re there — ” She 
shrugged. 

“Then what am I supposed to do?” 

“Do?” she cried. “Why get on 
Chiquita’s back! What do you think 
I brought her for? Just get on — 
she knows where to take you!” 

R yland rode the spaceling; it 
was like mounting a running 
stream. 

A slim golden shape, more slen- 
der than a seal, floating in the air; 
gold, pure gold that blended into 
black at the tail, it was the strang- 
est mount a man ever bestrode. 
Donna said a quick word of com- 
mand. The spaceling purred faintly, 
rippled its lazy muscles and whoom. 
It was like a muffled slap of metal. 
Suddenly they had leaped a hundred 
feet into the air. 

There was no shock, no crushing 
blow of acceleration. There was 
just a quick vibrant lift, and they 
were high in the air. 

Through the thin coveralls that 
were his only garment Ryeland felt 
the purring vibration of the space- 
ling’s body. Down below he saw the 
Planner’s daughter already entering 




her rocket. She did not intend to 
wait for trouble. The jets flared. 
Ryeland heard the sound — but it 
was receding, receding although the 
rocket had already begun to climb; 
they were climbing too, and fast, 
Ryeland was breathless. He clung to 
the spaceling. There was no pres- 
sure; only his arms held him to that 
bare, warm, smooth back. His stom- 
ach fluttered. His breathing caught. 
Down below he saw men moving, 
insects on the lawn and the walks. 
But they were not looking up, prob- 
ably couldn’t see him if they did; it 
was still night, and the hovering heli- 
copters, with their floodlights were 
between him and the ground. 

They were n.?arly a thousand feet 
in the air now. Donna’s rocket, a 
black dot in the center of its own 
petaled flame, seemed plastered 
against the concrete of the pit 
below. Only the fact that its size 
stayed constant showed that it was 
following them; then even it began 
to dwindle. 

Off to the northeast was a storm, 
the warning cirrus veil across the 
sky, the dark towering cumulonim- 
bus, the rain squalls already march- 
ing across the dark mountains of 
Cuba. Jhe spaceling turned toward 
the storm. “Wait!” cried Ryeland. 
“Don’t go into thatV^ But the space- 
ling didn’t understand, or wouldn’t. 
It purred warmly, like a fat kitten, 
and arrowed toward the menacing 
cloud with its violent gusts. 

And still Ryeland felt no motion. 

All his body was accelerated uni- 
formly by the spaceling’s field, what- 
ever it was. The air came with them, 
the pocket which the spaceling wore 



like a halo, its blue shroud of faintly 
glowing light. Their flight was not 
quite noiseless, though nearly; the 
only sound was a faint distant tear- 
ing, though they were barreling 
through the sky at surely sonic 
speed. Incredible! Ryeland’s mathe- 
matician’s mind fitted pieces togeth- 
er; the spaceling, he thought, must 
form a capsule ’ which instantly 
shapes itself to meet the resistance — 
forming the perfect streamline shape 
for its needs, blunt teardrop at a 
hundred miles an hour, needle as it 
approached sound’s speed, probably 
wasp-waisted area-rule profile at 
higher speeds. 

And still there was no sense of mo- 
tion, though Heaven had dropped 
away behind them and was gone. 

N ow they were over water. 

All around them was cloud. 
They were hurtling into the furious 
wall of towering thunderstorms that 
was the forefront of a hurricane. 

Cold rain drenched him in an in- 
stant. That was curious, thought the 
objective, never-stilled part of his 
mind; rain penetrated the capsule 
where the rush of air did not! But 
there was no time to think of it. 
The rain was pelting icewater, un- 
comfortable, chilling. It disturbed 
the spaceling, too. Its satisfied purr 
changed to a complaining mew; it 
shook and shuddered. But it plunged 
on. 

Ryeland was hopelessly lost. 

The storm was the same in all di- 
rections, a dim void of fog and icy 
water, flickering with distant light- 
ning. But the spaceling knew where 
it was going ... he hoped. 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



75 




They drilled through the top of 
the clouds and came out above 
them into clear air. Underneath 
them the shape of the storm re- 
vealed itself in a great spiral, the 
hurricane wheeling around its open 
eye. A bright light burst on him. It 
was the sun, rising again on the 
western horizon — they were that 
high! It was a blaze of incandescence 
in the dark; and still they climbed. 

A great elation possessed Ryeland. 

He had done the impossible! He 
had escaped, with all his limbs and 
faculties, from the hell they called 
Heaven! 

He was no longer a numbered 
carcass; he was a man again. And 
Donna Creery had done it, where 
he had failed; he owed her some- 
thing. He wondered briefly what it 
was she had failed to tell him about 
her father; then dismissed it. That 
wonder was lost in the greater soar- 
ing wonder of free flight. The sky 
was black around them — surely the 
air was thin now. And still they 
climbed, while the vast hazy floor 
of sea and cloud became visibly 
convex. 

And still they climbed; and the 
air was thin now. 

That was all wrong! Ryeland 
knew that much; the spaceling’s 
field should hold the air. But the 
creature itsejf was gasning now, 
panting. Its purring and mewing 
had tujned into the choking cough 
of a tiger. They still climbed, but 
Ryeland could feel the creature 
falter. 

They were at a dangerous alti- 
tude. Suddenly he was breathless. 
His drenched body was chilled 



through, even in the white, bright 
glare of the naked sun. 

It was the spaceling’s wounds that 
were endangering them now, Rye- 
land realized. Gottling’s torture 
chamber had left its marks. The 
creature’s symbiotes had been des- 
troyed, or some of them had. Its 
fusorians that gave it power, its 
parasitic Reef animalcules that made 
it possible for a warm-blooded air- 
breather to live in space in the first 
place, their numbers had been great- 
ly diminished. They were not all 
gone, for there was still some air. 
It filled his grasping lungs, kept his 
body fluids from boiling out, 
screened him at least a little from 
the cold and the even more deadly 
UV of the sun. There was some air 
. but was there enough? 

Ryeland laughed grimly, with al- 
most the last of his breath. “That’s 
what I’ll find out,” he panted, hoarse- 
ly .. and passed out. He was not 
conscious of the moment when he 
blacked out; he only knew that he 
was going. 

ATThen he awoke, it was with 
^ ^ sheer v/onder that he was 
alive. 

Donna Creery’s perfect face 
bent over him, making the wonder 
all the greater. “I made it,” he whis- 
pered incredulously. 

The girl said seriously, “Yes, so 
far. But don’t crowd your luck, 
Ryeland. We’re still in trouble.” 

He stirred to get up — and float- 
ed free, until the girl’s restraining 
hand pushed him back against the 
metal acceleration couch. They 
were in a spaceship, apparently in 



76 



IF 




free-fall. He looked around. Auto- 
matically he said, ‘‘I’ve got to find a 
— ” He stopped. He had been about 
to ask where the teletype was, so 
that he could check in with the Ma- 
chine. But that was no longer neces- 
sary, of course. 

Donna Creery gestured at the ca- 
bin of the spaceship. “You like it, 
Steven? It’s yours.” 

He was startled. “Mine?” 

“Oh, yes. Do you remember the 
ship that General Fleemer equipped 
for you, with remote controls from 
Point Triangle Gray? This is it — 
with some changes. I’ve removed the 
remote controls. But it was a per- 
fectly good interplanetary rocket, 
right in orbit where Chiquita could 
bring you to it. Only — ” she looked 
worried. “Only I’m surprised that 
Father isn’t here.” 

Ryeland shook his head. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I don’t un- 
derstand. Why does the Planner 
want me here?” 

She said, “He ought to tell you 
himself, but perhaps I can. Did you 
know, Steven, that in the past two 
months there have been over a hun- 
dred major seismic shocks? And 
they always seem to strike centers 
of population. My father thinks — 
well, it doesn’t sound right when I 
say it. He thinks the Machine is do- 
ing it.” 

“The Machine!” 

“I know, Steven. But Father is 
worried. He has discovered that 
General Fleemer and others have 
been tampering with the Machine! 
Father is a good man, Steven, and 
he says he does not understand this. 
But I do. Fleemer wants to control 




THE REEFS OF SPACE 



77 




the Machine — because he wants to 
control the Plan of Man — and de- 
stroying the project for discovery of 
a jetless drive is only one step in his 
plan. All those seismic shocks and ac- 
cidents with subtrain tubes and fu- 
sion reactors and the new ion 
drives — they’re all part of it, too. 
Deliberate sabotage! 

“And, oh, Steven! How well it has 
worked! The Machine is only trans- 
istors and relays, you know; it knows 
nothing but what is fed into it. 
Fleemer has managed to corrupt its 
input circuits, and now the Machine 
is almost openly hostile to Father, 
and the whole crux of the matter 
right now is the jetless drive. The 
Machine has come to think that such 
a drive will destroy the Plan of 
Man. It has overruled Father’s or- 
ders on it — oh, a thousand times 
— so that Father has to resort to 
subterfuge and tricks. He let me 
rescue you, as one of his moves. 
But I’m afraid it’s too late.” 

She moved away, peering wor- 
riedly at the viewports on the space- 
ship’s panel. “They don’t seem to be 
following Not yet, anyhow.” 

Ryeland noticed he was shivering. 
It was not cold in the ship, but he 
had only the ill-fitting coveralls to 
wear and they were soaked through. 
“Who?” he demanded. 

“The Plan police,” she said, sur- 
prised. “General Fleemer will be 
after Chiquita, even if they don’t 
suspect you are with me. Though we 
can’t count on that, of course; it 
wouldn’t be unreasonable for the 
Machine to inform them that I had 
rescued you from Heaven He was 
going to kill Chiquita, you see, so 



1 stole her.” She frowned as Ryeland 
shook his head. 

“Why shouldn’t I steal her?” the 
girl flared. “She was mine! And the 
only safe place for Chiquita is out 
in space — out on the Reefs, if I 
can get her there. And, of course, 
that’s the only safe place for you.” 

Ryeland said angrily, “You’re 
asking me to run away from the 
Machine! You want me to be an 
outlaw!” 

“Oh, Steven, what do you think 
you are? Have you forgotten Heav- 
en already? 1 saved your life . 
You’re lucky you got here,” she 
said seriously, stroking the space- 
ling. “I wasn’t at all sure Chiquita 
could make the jump from atmos- 
phere.” 

“Neither was I.” 

She smiled, and for a moment 
she was the impish, confident girl 
who had interviewed him in her 
bath. But quickly her face clouded 
again. “I wish Father would come,” 
she said. “Chiquita can’t live forever 
without getting back to the Reefs to 
replenish her fusorians. And 1 — 
well, I sent my own rocket back to 
Earth and crashed it where they’ll 
find it. Perhaps they’ll think we were 
both killed. But,” she said calmly, 
“they would have to be stupid to be 
deceived very long, and the Ma- 
chine is never stupid. It’s — I don’t 
know — unbalanced, now. But it is 
thorough. Father and I discussed it 
thoroughly; he knows the Machine 
well. He thinks we have about 
twelve hours.” 

“Then what?” 

“Why, then the Machine will trig- 
ger your collar.” 



78 



IF 




I nvoluntarily Ryeland*s fingers 
came up to touch the dull met- 
al that encircled his neck. 

The girl was right; that was what 
the machine would do. Twelve 
hours? He didn’t know; but prob- 
ably the Planner did. All right. Then 
in twelve hours they had to be out 
of range. 

‘‘Can we get away from the Ma- 
chine’s radar beam in twelve hours?” 
he demanded. 

“I don’t know, Steven. I think so. 
The Machine may not realize that 
you are in space.” 

The girl restlessly prowled toward 
the viewports. “But Father isn’t here. 
I don’t know how long we can af- 
ford to wait. Once we get out to 
the Reefs, of course, there’s noth- 
ing to worry about. You won’t have 
your collar any more.” 

He looked startled. She smiled. 
“Don’t you remember, Steven? Ron 
Donderevo. The man who got his 
iron collar off; he’s out there. I’m 
sure he can do the same with yours.” 
Restlessly Ryeland touched his 
collar. “Please,” he begged. “Tell me 
what you know about Donderevo” 

. about, he thought silently, the 
man this junk body of mine was 
built to replace. 

“You know everything there is to 
tell. Or almost,” she said. “He was 
once a friend of my father — in 
spite of all their differences over the 
future of the Plan of Man. It was 
Donderevo who first told my father 
something about the spacelings and 
the reefs, and convinced him that 
the Machine should try to develop 
a jetless drive. 

“Unfortunately, when the Plan 



took over his people, Donderevo 
engaged in disloyal activities. For 
that reason he was classified as a 
Risk and finally sent to the stock- 
pile. The fact that Father com- 
municated with him while he was in 
the stockpile, and finally ^connived 
at his escape, is one of the charges 
that Fleemer is using now in his 
effort to discredit Father with the 
Machine. 

“I think Donderevo might be able 
to help Father now, in this fight 
with Fleemer for control of the 
Machine and the future of the Plan. 
At least he could tell the Ma- 
chine more about the reefs than it 
got from Lescure’s reports — after 
Fleemer had finished doctoring 
them. And that’s where we must go, 
Steve — to find Donderevo, out to 
the Reefs of Space!” 

Ryeland was suddenly afraid to 
tell Donna how desperately he 
wanted to see Ron Donderevo. Don- 
derevo might help him remove the 
iron collar. Donderevo might help 
him clear up the fog of oblivion and 
contradiction in his past. But it was 
also possible that Donderevo would 
tell him that the collar could not 
be removed — not without the ela- 
borate surgical facilities available 
only at the stockpile. It was even 
possible that Donderevo would af- 
firm what Angela had told him — 
that he was a junk man, a meat ma- 
chine patched together from a few 
bits of waste tissue, not worth sav- 
ing from the collar. 

If that were true, he thought, he 
couldn’t stand for Donna Creery 
ever to find it out. The Planner’s 
daughter — and a few pounds of 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



79 




salvaged human garbage. The gulf 
between them would be too wide 
for any warm emotion to cross. 

Donna Creery looked again at 
the viewports and sighed. ‘T don’t 
know why Father isn’t here,” she 
said, “but we dare not wait any 
longer. I’ll send him a message and 
we’ll go. Even the Machine’s normal 
radar beam might reach out this 
far; we’ve got to get out of range.” 
She smiled. “It isn’t only for your 
sake, you know. If that collar were 
triggered in this little ship ...” 

She pursed her lips gravely and 
shook her head. 

XV 

R yeland was deep in a dream 
of an armless, legless blonde 
with Oporto’s grinning face coming 
at him with a sonic hacksaw. When 
the earth began to shake, his body 
vibrated like a harpstring ... and he 
awoke. Donna Creery was leaning 
over him. 

Uncomfortably he stretched and 
rubbed his tingling hands and ankles. 
It took him several seconds to wake 
up. Not unusual; the sleep that 
spans interplanetary distances is not 
lightly thrown off. They had put 
themselves under for what was to 
have been a voyage of a hundred 
and fifty days. Were they at the 
end of it already? 

But Donna’s face was worried, 
and there was a loud excited mew- 
ing from the ship’s cargo lock. Rye- 
land groaned and tried to shake the 
aches out of his bones. Thank heav- 
en they were in space, he thought. 
The mild thrust of Hohmann-mini- 



ma orbits kept the endless contact 
of body-to-bed from producing the 
bed sores and bruises that would 
have been inevitable on Earth. “Ste- 
ven!” the girl cried frantically. 

“Sorry,” he mumbled, shook him- 
self and woke up at last. “What’s the 
matter?” 

“Chiquita’s gone crazy!” He grunt- 
ed and climbed up, peering into the 
cargo hold. The spaceling was flash- 
ing about the lock like a tom on 
the trail of a skulking mouse. She 
was mewing frantically. 

“Are we here?” 

“No, Steven! But Chiquita got so 
excited that she triggered the alarms 
and woke me up. We should be 
traveling for days yet!” 

“All right. Let’s see what’s both- 
ering her.” 

“But there’s nothing to see. We’re 
in deep space now, Steven. Far out 
beyond Pluto — and yet surely not 
as far as the Reefs. There couldn’t 
possibly be anything here that could 
bother her ...” 

She stopped, listening. 

Both of them heard it at the 
same moment. It was an irritated 
hammering sound. 

They stared at each other. 

It came again, a muffled banging 
on their ship’s hull. “Let’s take a 
look,” Ryeland said grimly. The 
viewports showed nothing, but on 
the outer door of the airlock was a 
small window, shielded against 
chance radiation. Ryeland slipped 
the catch and slid open the shields. 

A man stared in, with an expres- 
sion of impatient annoyance. 

A man! 

Ryeland and the girl looked at 

IF 



80 




each other and then at the face that 
peered in on them. It was quite im- 
possible. But it was undeniably true. 

T he man did not even wear a 
spacesuit. He wore a ragged 
blanket, hammering on the valve of 
the airlock with the handle of a long 
knife. He was a lean little red- 
bearded man, not young. 

Donna cried out suddenly. “Ste- 
ven! I know him. His name is 
Quiveras. Why, he brought Chiqui- 
ta to Earth — to rescue Donderevo 
from the stockpile.” She hesitated, 
then said abruptly: “Open the lock, 
Steven.” 

“What?” 

“Open the lock, man!” 

“But the air—” 

“Oh, there’s no worry about that,” 
she said impatiently. “Look!” She 
pointed behind the man’s head 
where a smooth-lined shape rippled. 
Another spaceling! No wonder Chi- 
quita had been so upset; undoubted- 
ly she had sensed its presence, a 
creature like herself though larger 
and darker. “He’s got his own air. 
The spaceling carried it. How do 
you suppose he lives? Open the 
lock!” 

Ryeland hesitated. Reason told 
him the girl was right; there could 
be no other explanation. Reason 
was certain; but his emotional con- 
ditioning against opening a door to 
the great exploding suck of space 
was too powerful to give in to mere 
reason without combat; it took a 
great deal of self-discipline for Rye- 
land to turn the valve key. But he 
did it. A metallic whine; a hiss of 
equalizing pressure. And the lock 



was open, and they were still breath- 
ing air — queerly scented air, with 
a faint, hot, chemical bouquet, but 
not unpleasant. 

The little man hurried inside. 

He whistled sharply and his space- 
ling followed. It was a red-nosed, 
stub-winged seal, its nose" pulsing 
with red light. Its huge eyes peered 
around the chamber; it was whining 
shrilly with pleasure and excitement. 

“Wait!” cried the little man. The 
spaceling was frantic, but obedient; 
it paused in the lock while the man 
spun the closing valve. Then Quiv- 
eras said, “All right, Adam. Go meet 
your friend.” 

The two spacelings flew at each 
other. 

Around and around the narrow 
cargo compartment they spun, mew- 
ing and purring in soprano-baritone 
counterpoint. Quiveras grinned. “Ah, 
the children! How happy to see 
each other they are!’* He bowed and 
took off his rag of a hat. “And I, 
sir and madam. I am Quintano 
Quivaro Quiveras, your humble ser- 
vant.” 

He looked again at Donna Creery 
and smiled with real pleasure. “Ah, 
the Planner’s daughter! It is good to 
see you! And you, sir; it is good to 
see you as well, though I do not 
as yet know your name.” 

“Steve Ryeland.” He put out his 
hand, and gravely they shook. 

Donna managed to say: “We’re 
pleased to see you too, Mr. Quiver- 
as. But—” 

“But what is Quiveras doing 
here?” The man smiled and bowed 
again. “Ah, perhaps I may help. My 
Adam felt the presence of Chiquita 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



81 




here.” He reached out and stroked 
the golden she-spaceling; the two of 
them hung poised, their flanks 
touching, just behind him. “So he 
wished to join you; and then, there 
is another reason.” The smile left 
his face. “My Adam and I, we have 
been watching you for some time. 
Adam has excellent vision, apart 
from the way that spacelings have 
of knowing another spaceling is near 
even when vision is of no use. And 
Adam saw something. With his help, 
I saw it too.” 

“What’s that?” 

“Why,” said Quiveras seriously, 
“perhaps you do not know it, but 
you are being followed by a heavy 
war rocket of the Plan of Man.” 

I nvoluntarily Ryeland’s fingers 

stole up to touch his collar. 
Donna Creery’s face turned chalk- 
white. Their signal to the Planner 
must have been intercepted; Fleem- 
er knew where they were. 

The equations of military affairs 
in open space admit of only one 
solution: The faster vessel could al- 
ways force battle on the slower. The 
logic of the radar-pulse that would 
trigger the collar on Ryeland’s neck 
made it certain that the battle 
could be decided only one way. If 
they fled, the Plan cruiser would 
overtake them. If they stopped their 
jets, it would calculate course and 
position from the last recorded 
points with no chance whatsoever of 
error. The jets made a magnificent 
target, their light and heat a beacon 
for a million miles. Every effort at 
escape would plot another blip on 
the Plan cruiser’s thermal screens. 



And then the radar pulse would 
detonate the collar. 

Ry eland said harshly: “Can we 
fight? Are there any arms on the 
ship?” 

Quiveras’s gnarled face took on 
an expression of surprise. “Fight 
against the Plan? Oh, no, my young 
friend. We do not fight them; that 
is their way. We follow our way. We 
merely run away.” He nodded. “We 
are some millions of miles from the 
Reefs, yes; it is a considerable jour- 
ney. But at the end of the journey 
is freedom. Perhaps even — ” he 
followed Ryeland’s stroking fingers 
on the collar with his eyes — “free- 
dom from that thing about your 
neck.” 

“We have no lifeboat!” 

Quiveras pursed his lips. He point- 
ed to the two spacelings, frolicking 
about. 

iRyeland said with quick compre- 
hension: “The jetless drive! Of 
course. They can get us away from 
our rocket, and as they do not use 
thermal propulsion, the Plan ship 
won’t be able to spot them. But — 
the female is injured, Quiveras. She 
almost killed me before, in just a 
few minutes in space. Look.” He in- 
dicated the ridged scars Colonel 
Gottling had left on her golden fur. 

“But she’s had time to heal, Ste- 
ven!” cried Donna Creery. “Don’t 
forget we’ve been aspace for over 
four months!” 

Quiveras looked suddenly worried. 
Ignoring the girl, he dropped to one 
knee and crooned to the spaceling. 
Chiquita frolicked over and hung 
before him, purring faintly as he 
stroked the scars. At last Quiveras

looked up, his gnarled face con- 
cerned. “These were bad wounds, 
Miss Creery. I did not think you 
would treat her like that.” 

“It wasn’t I!” 

Quiveras shook his head. Obstin- 
ately, he said, “They are bad. I do 
not know if she will ever altogether 
heal.” 

Ryeland said stonily, “Are you tell- 
ing us that we can’t get away by 
spaceling, then?” 

“Oh, no!” The little man was up- 
set. “I did not mean to frighten you. 
My Adam can hold enough air for 
us all, I promise. We must go quick- 
ly.” 

“No,” said Ryeland. 

The girl and Quiveras paused, 
staring at him. 

“Not like that,” he said. “This 
rocket was equipped for me, to 
work out some of the problems of 
the jetless drive. I need that equip- 
ment — for, if it is as important as 
you say, we must have it. The space- 
lings will have to tow it — No,” he 
said, not letting Quiveras object, “I 
know it will be difficult. But I must 
have it. And one other thing.” 

Quiveras looked at him coldly, 
then at last smiled. “Very well. If 
you are willing to go slowly, Adam 
and Chiquita can pull along what- 
ever it is you want. What is the 
other thing?” 

Ryeland said: “I want to set a fuse 
on this ship’s fuel compartment. I 
don’t want them poking around in it 
after we go; I want to blow it up.” 

I n ten minutes they had locked 
out some tons of computers, 
electronic instruments, a power 



source and a handful of other gear; 
Ryeland took another five to wire 
contacts to a time-clock and set 
them to explode the ship’s fuel, and 
then they were ready to leave the 
spaceship. 

It was like making up one’s mind 
to leap off a building. They stood in 
the open airlock, and there outside 
was the universe of stars. Ryeland 
felt more helpless and small than 
ever before in his life; how could 
human flesh survive that great cold 
barrage of light? 

But Quiveras assured them that 
the spaceling’s bubble of gas had re- 
mained about the ship, held there by 
the spaceling even through the ship’s 
hull. And in fact, they could see 
strange shapes and colors, hardly vis- 
ible with their eyes, still used to the 
bright ship’s interior and dazzled by 
the distant display of multitudinous 
suns. 

Ryeland and the girl joined hands 
and leaped, and they floated into 
the world of the spaceling. 

They felt nothing, but they began 
to move away. The two spacelings 
swam among them, apparently un- 
heeding, but the jetless drive their 
bodies produced was moving them 
all at a tangent to the rocket’s line 
of flight, diverging from it slowly. 
As they drew off from the ship, the 
captive air the spaceling carried with 
it detached itself from its resting 
places along the hull of the ship. 
The bubble condensed. The air be- 
came denser. Scraps of solid mater- 
ial drifted into place. 

Behind them, in a long string 
pointing toward the rocket ship they 
had left, an occasional glint of star-

shine showed the trail of instruments 
Ryeland had demanded they take 
with them. But they saw them only 
briefly, and then the spaceling’s 
world was coalescing about them, 
and it was a fairyland. 

I t was incredible! Donna and 
Ryeland stared about, unbe- 
lieving. As the bits and pieces sorted 
themselves into their accustomed re- 
lationships they became a cool green 
cloud, so bright that Ryeland could 
hardly see the stars outside. Strange- 
leafed vines twined through the 
cloud," laden with clusters of unfa- 
miliar fruit. Small creatures that 
were half fish and half bird flitted 
through the vines. 

They were at the center, and as 
the air reached earth-normal densi- 
ty the invisible small creatures that 



gave it light and life were thickly 
packed about them. They could 
move. Ryeland roamed restlessly 
around the mad little bubble of life 
they inhabited, with naked space 
only yards away, staring, thinking, 
asking quick questions of Quiveras. 
The little man had apologetically 
few answers for him, but the facts 
spoke for themselves. ‘Tncredible!” 
he muttered. “Fantastic!” He caught 
himself on a tendril of vine eighteen 
inches from the faint veil that 
marked the end of the bubble 
and stared out at the stars. He 
could recognize no constellations; 
great Orion and the mighty South- 
ern Cross alike were out there, but 
buried in a swarm of thousands of 
lesser lights, invisible on earth but 
here a snow-sprinkling of radiance.

Ryeland. But I know about flavorf’* 
At that moment a great soundless 
flower of fire unfolded behind them. 
They all whirled to look. 

Ryeland said soberly: “There goes 
our rocket. I hope we’re going to 
like this place, Donna. It’s all 
we’ve got now.” 

T hey gathered close to the film 
at the very rim of the bubble, 
peering out. “Not too close,” warned 
Quiveras. “You must not stick even 
your little finger through it. You will 
be blown out, you see.” 

Ryeland looked startled, then, 
after a moment, nodded. “Of course. 
Anything much larger than a mole- 
cule is not reflected, eh? And once 
the field was penetrated, it would 
be forced out by the pressure dif- 
ferential.” Very cautiously they set- 
tled themselves to peer out at the 
ship they had left behind. The flame 
was gone, but even in its microsec- 
onds it had heated metal to red in- 
candescence and they could see a 
ruddy skeleton that was all that was 
left of the craft’s main supporting 
beams. The hull and fitting were 
scattered by the blast; but near the 
dark red glow they could make out 
faint points of light. The war rocket, 
Quiveras declared positively. The 
lights they saw were the flare of its 
auxiliary rockets as it matched posi- 
tion with the abandoned hulk. 

The spacelings hung looking out 
through the tangle of glowing vines, 
searching the dark outward sky. 
They made «oft murmuring and 
whimpering sounds. Quiveras is- 
tened to them, stroking their sleek 
fur. crooning to them gently. 



“They are watching the Plan 
rocket,” he told the others. “The 
ship radiates its own infrared. They 
can see it well, now that it is com- 
ing closer.” 

“Closer?” Ryeland was startled. 

“Of course, Mr. Ryeland. The 
Plan is not stupid.” 

“But — they must think we are 
dead! And even if not, they have no 
way of tracing the spacelings’ jet- 
less drive — ” 

“Nor have they,” Quiveras told 
him solemnly. “The Plan is merely 
thorough. I can understand what 
they are saying in that cruiser. ‘Did 
they have an escape vessel? If so, 
where would they be going?’ To the 
Reefs. And the Plan knows v/here 
the Reefs must be.” 

The spacelings were growing un- 
easy. “And our friends here are tir- 
ing,” Quiveras said soberly. “They 
need rest. Carrying all of us, and 
all of your equipment, Mr. Ryeland 
— even for two of them it is a great 
load. They cannot go faster, and so 
they are going to try to hide. There.” 

He pointed out through the glow- 
ing vines. 

Ryeland looked. The brilliance 
of their little atmosphere was in his 
way. He kicked himself — very 
warily! — to the other end of their 
bubble and hung, clutching a vine 
and staring; but if there was some- 
thing to see his untrained eyes could 
not make it out. 

Quiveras followed. “It is a cluster 
of Reefs,” he explained. “There, near 
those three blue-white stars.” 

Ryeland’s Earth-adapted eyes 
were not equal to the task. But Chi- 
quita and Adam slipped close to him 



86 



IF 




and hung among the bright leaves, 
their sad eyes staring into the star- 
sprinkled space ahead. Ryeland 
shook his head. “I don’t see anything 
at all.” 

“Nor did I,” Quiveras agreed, “un- 
til the spacelings showed me. We are 
not equipped to find a pebble in the 
dark, countless miles away; but they 
are.” 

Ryeland said doubtfully, “Even if 
there are Reefs there, and we get 
to them — can’t the Plan rocket fol- 
low us?” 

Quiveras shrugged. “Of course. 
But the Reefs are in a thicker cloud 
than this little bubble of Adam’s, 
Mr. Ryeland. There are swarms of 
the little fireflies that you call fusor- 
ians; they’ll fog his search screens. 
There are hunks of bigger stuff that 
will slow him down — perhaps even 
wreck him, Mr. Ryeland, if he 
should be careless! Still, he may get 
through and find us. Yes. It is a 
chance, but we have no choice but 
to take it.” 

They drove on for hours, there 
was no way of measuring just how 
long. As destination and pursuer 
were alike invisible to Ryeland, there 
were only the shrouded stars as ref- 
erence points, and their great dis- 
tance was not affected by the tiny 
crawl of the spacelings. Adam and 
Chiquita seemed hardly to be work- 
ing, as they slipped supplely about 
through the vines, yet Quiveras as- 
sured Ryeland they were moving 
nearly as fast as the Plan cruiser, 
in spite of the trail of machines that 
followed them. 

Then Quiveras said, “We are al- 
most there!” 



Ryeland sought among the stars 
for “there”. What made it hardest 
was that there was neither bow nor 
stern to their tiny captive world, no 
sure way of knowing which way they 
were going. He could find nothing. 
The stars shone splendid and unob- 
scured, as he hung at nearly the 
edge of their air capsule — red stars, 
blue-white giants, clouds of nebular 
matter . 

Then he saw the Reef ahead. 

XVI 

I t appeared first as a pale point 
of light that suddenly grew into a 
bulging, uneven sphere of splendor. 
It was a jeweled ball, floating in 
space, and the jewels were forests of 
crystal. 

They came closer, like a comet, 
then slower. Ryeland saw spiked 
trees of crystal carbon — diamond! 
— glittering with their own inner 
light. There were strange bulging 
brain-shaped masses of blue and vio- 
let, patches of ghostly white sand, a 
frozen forest with bright metal 
leaves. 

It was an incredible fairyland to 
Ryeland and the girl, but Quiveras 
surveyed it with a shrewd profes- 
sional eye and shook his head. 

“Not a good place to hide,” he 
said, peering at the glowing ball. 
“Still, that solid part might be use- 
ful. The Reefs are mostly hollow — 
because they’re dead inside.” 

Ryeland nodded. “I suppose the 
surface organisms are the ones that 
pick up the free hydrogen and grow. 
The ones inside die of starvation.” 
Quiveras was not listening. He 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



87 




cried gleefully: “Yes! There is a 
cave! — If it is not already oc- 
cupied.” 

Ryeland stared at him. Quiveras 
shrugged. “These Reefs do not have 
much gravitation; something must be 
holding the air there, as the space- 
lings do. It could be another space- 
ling. It could be small cells in the 
Reef itself — each Reef is its own 
world, I do not pretend that I know 
what to expect on this one. But it 
could be something quite bad.” He 
raised a hand. “Wait. Let us see.” 

The jeweled ball swam closer. 
“Watch,” ordered Quiveras. “See 
how Chiquita enters the air of this 
Reef. Adam is pulling us now; Chi- 
quita is controlling our atmosphere. 
Do you see?” 

The female spaceling was darting 
about, while Adam hung motionless. 
“I did wonder about that,” admitted 
Ryeland. “When the two spheres 
meet, air pressure will be forcing 
them apart.” 

Quiveras shook his head. “See, 
she airlocks the Reef in.” Ryeland 
stared. They came closer to the 
Reef and closer. From the fright- 
ened movements of the little fish- 
birds, he saw that the shell was be- 
ing contracted; yet there was no in- 
crease of pressure — “I see!” he 
cried suddenly. “She is setting up an- 
other shell, big enough for both us 
and the Reef! Then she’ll collapse 
our inner shell, letting the air leak 
out as it contracts to keep the pres- 
sure steady!” 

Quiveras nodded. There was a 
sudden vibration, as though the 
shock-front of a distant explosion 
had raced past them, and a clicking 



in their cars. The inner shell was 
finally gone. 

Ryeland stared about his new 
world. The steady rain of starlight, 
even through their light-fogged at- 
mosphere, gave him a view of a 
wonderland. The sun itself, hardly 
brighter than Sirius, made yellowish 
sparkles in the crystal branches of 
the — could he call it “vegetation”? 
But Quiveras gave him little time to 
admire the world. 

“Now we must do our ^>art, Mr. 
Ryeland,” he grinned. 

Ryeland saw that the two space- 
lings were hanging at a distance 
from the dark cave mouth, regard- 
ing it with huge wet eyes. Their red 
noses flickered swiftly. They whim- 
pered, and a shudder ran along 
Chiquita’s scarred flank. “What is 
our part?” 

Quiveras said calmly: “The space- 
lings have natural enemies — clum- 
sy, armored killers. Very slow — too 
slow to catch the spacelings out in 
space. But extremely deadly. They 
wait for them in places like these.” 
He said politely, “So we must ferret 
into this burrow, Mr. Ryeland, if 
you will do me the honor to join 



Q uiveras propelled himself to 
the mouth of the cave, peered 
inside, looked at the others and 
shrugged. “We will see,” was all he 
said. Calmly he unwrapped a bundle 
of rags and took out an old Plan 
Police handweapon. He was not very 
skillful with it; he worried at it until 
he had opened the clip, checked the 
number of charges it contained — 
Ryeland saw that it only held four;

IF 




undoubtedly Quiveras had found it 
difficult to obtain them — snapped 
it closed and balanced it in his hand. 
Then with the heel of his worn boot 
he kicked at a stalagmite of greenish 
crystal until it broke free. It was 
eighteen inches long or more and 
quite sharp. It made a queer but 
serviceable sword, Ryeland thought, 
and then realized that it made an 
even better torch. The interior of 
the cave was dark. The crystal sword 
glowed with its trapped fusorian 
cells. 

Quiveras scrambled into the cave 
and Ryeland followed, unable to 
look at the girl. 

It was a strange dark lair of wind- 
ing passages. The entrance was worn 
smooth — alarmingly — as though 
large bodies had been scraping in 
and out. Ryeland thought swiftly of 
the probable age of the Reef, and 
felt somewhat reassured. Time 
moved along different scales out 
here. Change could be lightning 
fast, or ponderously slow; those 
ledges might have been worn smooth 
a hundred million years ago. The 
dark passages, smooth-worn rock 
walls made of the bodies of once- 
living fusorians, had perhaps been 
dead when the Earth was still a 
boiling incandescent blob. There 
simply was no way to tell. Nor had 
Ryeland any idea of how long or 
deep the passages might be. They 
were as labyrinthine as the maze 
inside a head of sea-coral, where tiny 
crustaceans wait for tinier fish to 
blunder in. 

Quiveras paused where the pas- 
sage branched — and, within sight, 
both divisions inside a dozen yards 



branched again. He was staring at 
the wall. As Ryeland joined him, he 
saw what Quiveras had seen. 

The worn sides of some of the 
passages bore curving parallel scars, 
as though they had been rasped by 
the claws of some incredible mon- 
ster. 

Quiveras said cheerfully, ‘‘That 
one looks the most used, Mr. Rye- 
land. If we only knew when, eh? 
Well, ni try it — asking you, if you 
please, to remain here on guard.” 
He turned away, hesitated and said 
solemnly: “You see, it is you who 
must take the post of danger. For 
if a pyropod should come from one 
of the other passages while I am 
gone . .” He made a grave face, 
spread his hands politely and left. 

R yeland clung to a projection 
of rock and waited. 

Pyropod . 

He heard the word again, in the 
soft, apologetic, wheezy voice of Dr. 
Thrale. He was lying again on the 
therapy couch in the recreation cen- 
ter, clamped into the cold elec- 
trodes, helplessly enduring the merci- 
less probing into his blank memory. 
He shuddered again, flinching from 
that pitiless pressure to make him 
reveal the secret he had never 
known — 

Or had he really ever known how 
to build a jetless drive? That haunt- 
ing fog of black oblivion and insane 
contradiction flowed into his brain. 
Through it, he heard the lazy malice 
of Angela’s voice, mocking him with 
her explanation of the riddle. He 
was a junk man, a meat machine de- 
signed to sabotage the plan, without 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



89 




a memory because he lacked a past. 

A queer companion for the Plan- 
ner’s daughter. He resolved again 
not to tell her what he was. Now 
when they were alone, when he and 
Quiveras were the only human be- 
ings in her world, — could she stand 
the shock of learning that even he 
was no real human being? 

He shook himself impatiently, as 
if mere motion might dispel! that 
paralyzing fog and reveal his true 
identity. That old riddle would have 
to wait — perhaps until the timing 
mechanism detonated the collar, and 
answered it forever. The problems 
of the present were more urgent 
now. 

It was warm in the cavern, far 
from the surface of the little de- 
formed globe, where the fusorian 
cells poured endless heat and light 
into the atmosphere. But he found 
himself shivering. Pyropod? Yes. He 
had heard the term. He did not want 
to recall just what he had heard 
about it. 

Quiveras disappeared, the needle- 
sharp crystal blade giving a strange 
light. It disappeared around a bend 
in the passage, and then for a time 
there was no light at all. 

Time passed. 

It was dark . silent . empty. 
Ryeland felt as though the dead 
walls around* him were closing in. 
He wiped slippery sweat from his 
palms,^ listening, reaching out, be- 
cause he could not help himself, to 
touch the walls to make sure that 
they were not about to squeeze him 
. Then involuntarily he felt him- 
self grinning. Claustrophobia — 
herel Billions of miles from the 



Earth, a floating dust mote in the 
middle of absolute emptiness! The 
incongruity reassured him; and he 
was calm and cheerful when, at last, 
he saw the glow of light appear 
again in the passage Quiveras had 
taken. 

The crystal sword came into sight 
and Quiveras hailed him cheerfully. 
“A dead end, and nothing there. 
Very well.^^ He drew even with 
Ryeland and gazed at the other pas- 
sages. ‘T think,” he said, with some 
doubt, “that we will leave these 
others for now. They do not seem 
occupied, and it would take us 
weeks to explore them all. Consider 
yourself fortunate, my friend. You 
have not yet been introduced to a 
pyropod.” 

A t Quiveras’s hail the spacelings 
came swimming gracefully 
down the tunnel, their red noses 
blinking as they probed its depths 
with infrared. Donna Creery fol- 
lowed more slowly, exploring the 
caves with a child’s wonder and 
awe. “Is it safe?” she asked. 

Quiveras said calmly, “We will 
never be safe while Ryeland’s collar 
is with us. If you mean are we safe 
from pyropods, x do not know. 
From a full-grown one, yes. I do 
not guarantee there is not a cub 
lurking somewhere, but if there is 
we will find it out and meanwhile 
shall we not try to make this place 
into a home?” 

They worked for three hard days, 
while the spacelings fluttered and 
mewed restlessly — because, Quiver- 
as said without emotion, the Plan 
cruiser was still somewhere about. 



90 



IF 




As there was nothing they could do 
about it, they did nothing. To their 
little world they did a great deal. 

They carried aerial fusorian vines 
into the caverns, choosing cubicles 
for sleeping, for eating, for rest, 
curtaining and cushioning them with 
the vines, bringing shining crystals 
of ruby and topaz for heat and il- 
lumination. Donna cried out at its 
beauty. Indeed it was beautiful; and 
they were not finished. With Qui- 
veras for a teacher, Ryeland learned 
how to weave nets and ropes out of 
the fiber from the vines. The sur- 
face of the reef provided crystal 
and great branching arms of metal, 
pure copper, pure aluminum, pure 
silver. They hammered the metal 
into crude tools. And finally they 
made a sort of curtain, woven from 
the vines and crusted with broken 
pieces of crystal, which they 
stretched across the mouth of the 
cave to conceal it. 

Quiveras stood back and regard- 
ed it. 

“Well,” he said doubtfully, “it 
could be thicker and it could look 
more natural and those gadgets of 
yours could be hidden in better 
places. But if the Plan cruiser sniffs 
around here, it might miss you, at 
that.” 

“Miss us? What about you?” 

“I, Miss Creery, will go out to 
the main Reefs.” Quiveras’s gnarled 
face looked eager. “I’ll get help, 
more spacelings. And I’ll bring back 
Ron Donderevo!” 

Ryeland and the girl were sorry to 
see him go, but their sorrow was 
nothing compared to the unhappi- 
ness of the two spacelings at being 



separated. Adam would carry Qui- 
veras; Chiquita would have to stay 
with them, to maintain their atmos- 
phere and to be ready to carry them 
away in desperate flight if the Plan 
cruiser should grow too inquisitive. 

They watched him leave, all three 
of them, Ryeland, Donna Creery 
and the spaceling. He was gone out 
of sight in a moment. Ryeland 
thought he caught a single reddish 
wink from Adam’s nose — perhaps 
the male spaceling turning restless- 
ly as it drove away, to bid a last 
farewell to Chiquita. Then there 
was nothing. They stared till their 
eyes watered, but it was useless. The 
Plan cruisei could be lurking a mere 
hundred miles away — a thousand 
men on spacelings could be within 
ten miles. Without radar gear they 
were blind. Out there were only the 
stars. 

Ryeland’s mind drifted out among 
those stars wonderingly. He tried to 
imagine the clouds of new hydro- 
gen, constantly being born of the 
Hoyle effect, and the myraid drift- 
ing fusorians that built the hydro- 
gen into heavier elements that might 
someday be planets. There were 
other Reefs out there, the first con- 
centrations of matter like the one 
they occupied, the larger ones that 
provided a home for the exiles of 
the Plan — great ones, even, that 
might in some remote millenium be- 
come the cores for first condensa- 
tions of titanic new suns. They were 
all invisible. 

Donna Creery touched his arm. 
“It’s — lonely,” she whispered. “Let’s 
go back inside.” 

“Inside our cave!” he said harshly. 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



91 




“Back to the stone age! Is this the 
sort of life that’s fit for a princess 
of the Plan?” 

She shrank away from him, and 
m a moment went with the spaceling 
silently inside the sheltering drift of 
vines. Ryeland roamed about, trying 
to work off the sudden storm of 
anger and helplessness that was be- 
sieging him. He tried to calm him- 
self. 

But calm was impossible to him. 
Calm, he knew, was a sensation he 
would not be likely to feel, until he 
had managed to rid himself of the 
choking, threatening thing about his 
neck — and until he had managed 
to bridge that gap in his past, until 
he had escaped that dreadful, creep- 
ing cloud of forgetfulness and con- 
tradiction — 

Or until the collar’s explosion 
brought him the permanent calm of 
the grave. 

T ime passed. They both found 
plenty to do. Alone now, ex- 
cept for the spaceling, they were 
queerly constrained in each other’s 
company. Ryeland hardly recognized 
the bright, sure brat of the bath, 
with the angry Peace Dove and the 
fighting guard within instant call. 
Donna was quieter and younger 
now. They spoke of her father, and 
for the first time Ryeland was able 
to think of that semi-legendary 
Olymi^ian figure as a human being. 
Donna was terribly worried about 
her father. “But we couldn't wait 
for him, Steven. Only — I wish we 
had.” 

He asked her again why the Plan- 
ner had had to hide from the Ma- 



chine, and got the same answer he 
had been given before. It was no 
answer. “I don’t know, Steven, but 
he was worried. And it’s your equa- 
tions that are the key to it.” And 
that, of course, drove Ryeland out 
to stare at the banked machines he 
had brought with him from the 
rocket, but all he could do was stare. 
They needed space and order, and 
on this little reefling there was 
neither. 

They lived like primitive islanders, 
catching the tiny flying things with 
nets made of vines, feasting on the 
shining fruits. Ryeland’s mind was 
queasy at the thought of the radia- 
tion they were absorbing with every 
luscious bite, but his stomach was 
delighted. And, he thought, they 
were not the first to eat them and 
live. Perhaps the radiation was 
purely photonic; perhaps a sort of 
bioluminescence, like the green glow 
of a firefly. 

Ryeland asked the girl again how 
Fleemer and his allies had got the 
better of her father, and got the 
same answer he had been given be- 
fore. It was no answer. “I don’t 
know, Steve. Except that it is all 
about the jetless drive. Father told 
me that he approved the search for 
an interstellar drive as part of the 
original Plan, built into the Ma- 
chine. When he first learned about 
the spacelings, from Donderevo, he 
knew that a reactionless drive was 
possible. He began to organize an 
effort to learn how to build it. 
Immediately, he ran into fanatical 
opposition from men like Fleemer. 
I don’t know the reason for their 
opposition. It must have been some-

IF 




thing more than just the desire to 
grab Father’s place. Somehow, they 
were able to manipulate the Ma- 
chine. They have got it under their 
own control. But I still believe that 
we could rescue the Machine and 
Father and the Plan of Man — if 
we knew the secret of the space- 
lings.” 

That, of course, drove Ryeland to 
begin assembling and testing the 
computers he had brought from the 
rocket. But the crawling fog was 
thicker in his mind. He sat staring at 
the banked computers, but he could 
think of no approach more promis- 
ing than those he had tried when 
he was still on Fleemer’s team. He 
couldn’t be sure that the failure of 
the team attack was altogether due 
to Fleemer’s sabotage. 

Anyhow, he reflected, there 
wasn’t much that he could do in his 
cave on this reeflet. Even if he had 
been given the blueprints for a per- 
fected reactionless drive, he had no 
shop equipment. 

Hopelessly, he gave up the effort. 

D ays passed. Weeks passed. The 
spaceling roamed sadly around 
their little world, still worried. They 
could not tead its ways as Quiveras 
had, but its worry was plain. Was 
it the Plan cruiser, still skulking 
about? Or a nearer menace? They 
simply could not tell. Donna grew 
sulky and unhappy, until they had a 
brief, brittle quarrel of words one 
day and it exploded into weeping. 
She clung to him. “I’m sorry. It’s 
just that I always had so much. Ser- 
vants, clean clothes, cooked food. 
Power, too. And now — ” 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



She smiled up at him. Qucerly, 
Ryeland thrust her away then. He 
was churned up inside with feelings 
he could neither analyze nor handle. 
It was his turn to .be sulky and ir- 
ritable, because, though he did not 
know it, his inner self was becoming 
a battle ground — the site of a strug- 
gle between his common sense, on 
one hand, and on the other a grow- 
ing, potent love for the Planner’s 
daughter . 

Even his dreams were haunted. 

He slept restlessly, and felt that 
he was choking . He was in his 
office, miles under the surface of the 
Earth in the hidden complex of air- 
conditioned tunnels that held the 
Machine and its attendants. He 
heard the knocking on the locked 
door, and got up to open it for An- 
gela. 

But it wasn’t Angela. 

It was Donna Creery, white- 
smocked like the nurses at the stock- 
pile. She had brought the coffee and 
sandwiches on a plastic tray, but she 
screamed and threw them on the 
floor when she saw his face. 

“It’s Donderevo!” she was scream- 
ing. “It was Ron Donderevo — ” 

He wanted to tell her who he was, 
but suddenly he was strapped to the 
therapy couch in the recreation cen- 
ter, with shocks of paralvzing agony 
stabbing from the electrodes on his 
body. She was coming toward him 
again, in the white smock with a 
stitched red heart on her perfect 
breast, reaching for him with a long 
hooked scalpel. 

“You might as well tell us now.” 
She was wheezing at him with Dr. 
Thrale’s apologetic, asthmatic voice. 



“Tell us how tOfcbuild a jetless drive.” 

He wanted to tell her. The speci- 
fications were clear in his mind, 
amazingly simple; he couldn’t under- 
stand why there had to be so much 
fuss about such a simple thing. But 
his voice was paralyzed with the 
the shocks that made waves of daz- 
ing pain from the collar around his 
neck. And Donna wouldn’t let him 
talk. 

Now she wore a horned radar 
helmet. She was taunting him, with 
Fleemer’s ugly voice. One touch, 
Ryeland. Only one little touch on 
the detonation button, and your 
precious secret will die with you! 

Now she had Angela’s face. 

But she still had hands, like Don- 
na. He saw her touch the deadly 
little button. The collar about his 
neck blossomed and swelled — 

He awoke strangling. 

“I was dreaming!” He tugged fran- 
tically at the collar. No! It was no 
dream. The collar was there, and 
surely it was about to explode. His 
exacerbated imagination felt it puls- 
ing against his rasped throat. He 
thought he heard a sound from it, 
a tick, a whine, a purring of faint 
unstoppable engines. “No!” he shout- 
ed and leaped up out of the little 
nest of leaves where he slept. It was 
exploding! Not in a year, not in a 
minute — now. He flung himself 
wildly about in the no-gravity, 
shouting. 

Donna Creery came swiftly to 
him, and the terror in her face woke 
him, drowning his imaginary terrors. 

“What’s the matter?” he demand- 
ed harshly. 

“Steven! It’s Chiquita. She — she

was wandering about the lower pas- 
sages, where we’ve never been, and 
— ” She stopped, unable to speak on. 
Behind her the spaceling came, slow- 
ly, painfully, mewing tragically. 

Chiquita’s flank was a horror, 
raw flesh and golden ichor, with the 
mark of a great sharp claw. 

XVII 

T here were four cartridges in 
the clip. Ryeland checked them, 
blessed Quiveras for having left the 
gun and started down the passages. 
He didn’t say anything to Donna 
Creery; he didn’t know what to say. 

Then there was a pyropod on their 
Reef . 

Ryeland’s throat was raw and dry. 
Pyropods. ‘‘Flame-feet.” Outer-space 
animals which, Ryeland thought, 
sounded vaguely like Earthly squids. 
Ryeland tried to picture one, and 
failed; but Quiveras had said there 
was a possibility that the caverns in 
their Reef might house one. And 
Chiquita’s terrible wounds had con- 
verted that possibility into something 
far stronger. 

Ryeland paused at the end of the 
passages they had explored, and 
picked up . the discarded crystal 
sword Quiveras had left there. It was 
still bright; it was all the light he 
had. Then he drove into the first of 
the great convoluted burrows. 

In five minutes he was at an end; 
the tunnel narrowed sharply, so that 
he could hardly move, and poised 
bits of rubble showed that nothing 
of any size had passed that way in 
finite time. 

He went back again. Another tun- 



nel, a much longer one this time, 
but again a dead end. It was dif- 
ficult to maneuver; in no-gravity, he 
could not walk, and the shape and 
constriction of the tunnel made it 
hard to leap. 

He came to another branch and 
stopped. 

There were two tunnels, both en- 
ormous, both dark and soundless. 
The air was the air the spaceling had 
brought, but it had a sharp strange 
odor, like burning gunpowder. 

And one of the tunnels was 
scarred with the enormous claws 
that had left their sign near the sur- 
face. 

Ryeland plunged in without giv- 
ing himself time to think. 

He came almost at once to a 
chamber. He paused and hung in its 
entrance, peering about in the faint 
light his crystal sword gave. It was 
roughly spherical, so vast that its far- 
ther walls were dim; and in a niche 
at one side of it was a clutter of 
tangled objects. 

Warily he approached. 

It seemed to be a sort of midden, 
and the blood began to pulse in his 
ears. It contained odd-shaped ob- 
jects that might have resembled the 
bones and fangs and carapaces of 
animals like no animals that had 
ever lived on earth. He stood star- 
ing at it, every sense poised. Then, 
with infinite pain, he approached. 
There was no sound. There was no 
motion. Gently he poked the crys- 
talline light into a gap in the tangle. 
But nothing moved and there was 
nothing revealed. 

Ryeland moved back and consid- 
ered. 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



95 




Space had its own scale of time. 
The discarded bones and the claw- 
marks in the rock might look just 
as fresh after another hundred mil- 
lion years. Undoubtedly the cave had 
been abandoned. 

He turned. 

Something screamed behind him. 
He had only time to halt his turn, 
to start to move his head back. 

And the heap of bones exploded. 

V^hat kept Ryeland from dying at 
once was the tiny scope of 
the cavern, compared to the scale of 
interplanetary distances. The pyro- 
pod, rocket driven, enormously 
strong, hadn’t the room to maneu- 
ver or even to build up speed. But 
it blasted up at him with frighten- 
ing speed. It was huge — as Earth 
animals go — larger than a horse, 
and armored with mirror-bright 
scales. It had a solitary eye, a wide 
mirror on a stalked central organ. 
It had a single, enormous claw at the 
end of a writhing, flexible trunk. It 
roared like a rocket at takeoff — 
which it was — and the great 
heavy-metal claw snapped violently. 

But the trash in its way screened 
Ryeland for a moment; he was 
thrust back and out of the way, and 
the pyropod flew past to gouge 
great chips out of the wall of the 
cavern. 

Ryejand took quick aim and 
fired. 

Even in the roar of the pyropod’s 
drive, he could hear his bullet scream 
away, and knew that it had hit that 
armor and ricocheted off The py- 
ropod did not turn to strike toward 
him again; it turned away, in fact. 



and its thin bright tail whipped to- 
ward him. White fire jetted out fur- 
iously. The tail! The tail was a more 
fearsome weapon than the claw — 
the mighty drive that could hurl it 
through space could char him in a 
second! But Ryeland was already 
moving, and the blast missed him 
entirely, though a backwash of 
flame from the wall caught his leg 
and (he discovered later) raised 
great angry blisters on his skin. Rye- 
land crashed into the wall, spun like 
a racing swimmer in a pool, raised 
the gun again and fired — rapidly 
— one, two, three! 

And then his cartridges were 
gone . 

But one of those bullets had 
struck a target. The stalk that held 
its eye was hit. The bulb exploded; 
the creature was blinded. It blun- 
dered about the chamber like a 
rocket gone mad, colliding with the 
walls, recoiling, plunging wildly 
again. The blazing jet licked peril- 
ously close — 

And then the jet was screaming 
away, bouncing and roaring through 
the tunnel, out, out and away . 

Ryeland was hurt badly, burned, 
bleeding, aching in every muscle; 
and he had no breath left at all 
after that quick violent encounter. 
But he did not pause. He leaped to 
follow the pyropod, Donna was up 
there! 

He sailed through dark space, his 
crystal torch long since lost, tried to 
see through the utter dark, tried to 
shield his head from striking against 
the wall. It was good, now, that the 
tunnel was so narrow; there was 
really only one way to go.

IF 




And after interminable moments 
there was light. 

He drove toward it, rounded a 
bend, and saw Donna Creery hur- 
rying toward him — alive! She bore 
a coiled branch of the vine with its 
moons of luminous fusorians. 
‘'Steven! Thank God!” 

She tossed a loop of the vine to 
him; he caught it, and they drew 
themselves together. R y e I a n d 
caught her roughly. “The pyropodi 
What became of it?” 

“Gone,” said Donna Creery. “It 
went right by, out into space. Not 
having a nucleonic harpoon, I let it 
go. I think we’ve seen the last of it.” 
“It was hiding in a pile of bones,” 
said Ryeland, suddenly drained. “I 

— I think I hit its eye.” 

“Yes. At least, it acted blind. And 

— oh, Steven!” 

He looked at her, not compre- 
hending. Reaction? He tried to re- 
assure her. “It won’t be back, Don- 
na. You said yourself — ” 

“No, no. It’s Chiquita, Steven. I 
think she’s dying.” 

He nodded, hardly hearing. “Poor 
thing. Well, we’ve avenged her, I 
guess” 

“And what about avenging our- 
selves? Have you forgotten, Steve — 
if Chiquita dies, there’s nothing to 
hold our air!” 

T he spaceling lay motionless in 
a little cave lined with vines. 
Now and then she struggled rest- 
lessly — not to move, but to bring 
fresh air about her. She seemed both 
bloated and gaunt And the great 
wounds along her side were now 
crusted with dirty ocher scabs. 



“Poor Chiquita,” the girl whis- 
pered, stroking the soft fur. Donna 
crooned at the creature, and its 
great dull eyes fastened on her. 

Ryeland looked the spaceling 
over. Her belly was swollen angrily, 
but the flesh had shrunk from the 
rest of her body. Her fur was luster- 
less and unkempt. The flame-red 
brilliance was gone from her nose; 
it was cold, black, dry. He touched 
her: hot. Did she hav^ a fever? Rye- 
land could not know, but surely she 
was hotter than when he had clung 
to her neck, fleeing the body bank. 
The spaceling seemed tc know that 
he was trying to help. She licked 
her black tongue out at him feebly; 
it was all the effort she could make. 

Ryeland said reluctantly, “I don’t 
think there’s anything we can do for 
her.” 

“The light seems to bother her.” 

“All right. That much we can do.” 
But it wasn’t easy, in this little world 
of luminous crystal and vine. They 
found some growths that glowed 
only faintly and tugged them into 
place, thicker and thicker, until the 
little nook where Chiquita lay be- 
came a dim green hiding-hole. Chi- 
quita looked faintly grateful, but 
mostly she looked sick. 

They left her and went out to the 
surface to look at the stars. It was 
maddening, it was utterly madden- 
ing, to be so helpless! Ryeland clung 
to the edge of the tunnel, staring out 
toward emptiness. Somewhere out 
there, invisible but sure, lay the 
other Reefs The great outer Reefs 
where fugitive humans managed 
lives that were free of the Plan — 
where, above all, lived Ron Donder-

evo, the native spaceman who had 
been a student of the science of the 
Plan, a guest and a prisoner of the 
Planner. He had worn the iron col- 
lar of a Risk — the selfsame collar 
that choked Ryeland now, if Ange- 
la had told the truth. He had talked 
to the Planner about a jetless drive, 
had been consigned to the stockpile, 
had ridden Chiquita back to the 
Reefs. 

But — was he superhuman? 

Could he remove Ryeland’s col- 
lar — here in the reefs, without all 
the elaborate surgical facilities that 
had been available at the stockpile? 
Could he fill the gap in Ryeland’s 
tormented memory — or was there 
really any gap to fill, except the 
time before the dissected scraps of a 
hundred salvaged enemies of the 
Plan had been assembled to make 
a thinking thing without a past? 

By now Quiveras might have 
reached him. By now they might be 
on their way! Perhaps in a few days 
Quiveras and the stranger would 
come to the little Reef and look for 
Ryeland and the girl. 

By now Quiveras might have 
reached him. By now they might be 
on their way! Perhaps in a few days 
Quiveras and the stranger would 
come to the little Reef and look for 
Ryeland and the girl. 

And what would they find? 

Ryeland knew that the most prob- 
able answer was . death. 

T ime passed, and the spaceling 
stayed alive. But she was wealc- 
er and worse every day. 

The Reef became a dream to 
Ryeland. He lost all sense of time. 



He had no watch and there were no 
celestial objects to mark days or 
years very conveniently. He thought 
of a calendar, and tried to construct 
one. The sun was bright enough to 
be visible, but the trouble was that 
their little Reef had no perceptible 
rotation. No force from another bb- 
ject had ever set it spinning, perhaps; 
the same stars hung always over the 
tunnel mouth. It could tell them 
nothing of time. Painfully Ryeland 
located winking Algol and began a 
star-watch; its period would be his 
clock. 

Donna said gently: ‘Tt won’t help. 
You don’t know when the collar will 
go off.” 

And he realized that she had seen 
farther into his mind than he him- 
self. It was the ticking year that he 
was trying to measure, the year 
which was in any event his maxi- 
mum hope of life as long as that 
collar sat sullenly about his neck. 
Chiquita might not die, the Plan 
cruiser might not return, but his as- 
sassin was with him at every mo- 
ment. At one of those moments it 
would strike. That was the ultimate 
deadly promise of the iron collar. 
You could flee the radar guns of the 
Plan Police and even outrun their 
cruisers. You could in the Reefs of 
Space perhaps even avoid the wash 
of pulsed radar which the Machine 
would flood through the system. But 
the timing element would not be 
stopped and would not be merciful. 
In less than a year it would go 
off . 

And Ryeland’s guess, based on 
Algol’s cycle and a careful recollec- 
tion of how they had slept and eaten. 



THE REEFS OF SPACE

was that no less than six months had 
already passed. 

Chiquita was now terribly sick. 

The great claw-gashes had begun 
to heal, but her fever was high. She 
seemed thirsty, but she would not 
drink; she seemed in pain, but she 
hardly moved. Only a low whimper- 
ing mew came from the little bower 
they had made for her. 

Ryeland made a decision and went 
out onto the shell of their Reef to 
put it into practice. It was only a 
matter of moments before Donna 
followed. ‘What are you doing?” she 
demanded sharply. He stopped, 
caught working over the equipment 
the spacelings had transported from 
the ship for him — the equipment 
that he had not used and now was 
proposing to put to a use com- 
pletely unconnected with his original 
intention. 

He said, “How’s Chiquita?” But 
she would not be diverted. 

*^What are you doing?'' 

Ryeland said, “Rigging up a ra- 
dio. I’ve got all the parts. I — I 
thought I might be able to reach 
Quiveras and ask him to hurry — ” 

“Or maybe you thought you might 
reach that Plan cruiser?” 

Ryeland said strongly: “All right. 
Why not? Maybe we pushed our 
luck too far! Things weren’t so bad 
back in the B — back on Earth, I 
mean. The Plan of Man is reason- 
able. They’ll take us back if I sur- 
render, and even at worst, it can’t be 
worse than waiting here to die.” 

“Steven!” She reached up to stare 
into his eyes. “I won’t have you go- 
ing back!” 

“Who the devil,” he yelled in a 



cold counterfeit of rage, “do you 
think you’re ordering — ” But she 
stopped his lips. 

“Don’t say it,” she whispered. “I 
won’t let you. And anyway, I’m af- 
raid it’s too late.” 

It took him a second to react. 
“Chiquita!” 

He raced far ahead of her down 
to the dying spaceling. Chiquita had 
sunk into a sort of coma, motionless, 
barely breathing. Her belly was 
more and more misshapen, as with 
terminal malnutrition — or what- 
ever might correspond to it in the 
structure of a creature from space 

— and the rest of her body as wast- 
ed as the gaunt, starved babies of 
Oriental famines of old times. 

Ryeland reached out a hand to 
her — 

And drew it back! 

It was too late; it was all over. 
The spaceling had stopped breathing 
entirely. 

Absently Ryeland brushed the dull 
fur on her cooling neck. Dead, yes. 
No matter what secrets her alien 
metabolism held, there was no doubt 
that life had gone. 

And now . how long would the 
field that contained their air persist? 

Ryeland had no idea. In a fire- 
fly, he remembered, the biolumines- 
cence lingered for hours after death. 
Was this a related effect? Probably 
not. The strange force that drove 
the spaceling was something far re- 
moved from a mere greenish glow. 
It might last for a few minutes. It 
might — at any split second it might 

— disappear, and kill them instantly 
in a soundless explosion of released 
air.

IF 




Donna said softly, “Steven. Let’s 
go outside where we can see the 
stars.” 

T he Reef was a small hollowed 
planet, wheeling slowly now, 
perhaps because of some dying con- 
vulsion from Chiquita. From the 
mouth of the cave the whole star- 
dusted splendor of the heavens was 
revealed. The sun itself, yellow and 
distant, came up through tangled 
vines to look at them, like the head- 
light of a far-off locomotive. 

“The sun,” whispered Ryeland 
“Still the brightest star. We haven’t 
come so far.” 

They looked out at the mighty 
constellations, strange in their pow- 
dery mask of lesser stars but still 
identifiable — mighty Orion, the 
misty cluster of the Pleiades, the 
vast silvery sweep of the galaxy. 
There it was, thought Ryeland sober- 
ly, the terrible, wonderful new em- 
pire that they had hoped to help 
claim for Man. And they had failed. 

It was very strange and wonder- 
ful, but he felt almost at peace. 
They were still alive. It was a fact 
that brought with it a sense of un- 
bounded wealth. As everything had 
been lost with the death of the space- 
ling, now each tiny moment that 
they were somehow spared was a 
treasure. Each second was a joy. 

Ryeland anchored himself to a 
ledge of space coral, all silver and 
ruby, with Donna very light in his 
arms. They talked, not consecutive- 
ly. There were things each had to 
say. 

The one central fact — the fact 
that they were clinging to life by 



only the feeblest of grips — they did 
not mention. 

Donna said: 

“Father’s probably still on Earth. 
He can’t have got my message. He’d 
have followed if he did. He’s a busy, 
a driving man, Steven, and I used to 
hate him, but — Oh, Steven! Now 
I am only sorry for him. 

Ryeland said: 

“You wouldn’t remember. You 
were bathing, and I blundered in. 
I was embarrassed. I guess you were, 
too. No, you probably weren’t. And 
you had the Peace Dove. It nearly 
killed — what was his name? Opor- 
to.” Cloudily it struck him as odd: 
he had almost forgotten the man 
who had been the nearest thing he 
had to a friend. 

Donna said: 

“That was Father’s idea, the Peace 
Dove. If you hate black . call it 
white, and love it. So he took that 
murdering thing and called it 
‘Peace’. He always boasted: ‘The 
Planner is the first ruler in all 
Earth’s history who has never need- 
ed a bodyguard.’ But what would 
you call those things? My Peace 
Doves. His Hawks.” 

Ryeland said, with a sudden rush 
of amazement: 

“Donna! We’re still alive!” 

XVIII 

T hey looked at each other in 
wonderment, for sure enough, 
it was true. They had not died of air- 
strangulation. Around them their 
little world was still intact. 

“But surely the spaceling was 
dead!” Donna cried. 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



101 




"No Joubt of that. I don’t under- 
stand this.” 

They looked around anxiously. 
The stars blazed down on them, and 
that was all there was to be seen 
beyond the confines of the tiny air 
bubble that made their world. 

"Look!” cried Ryeland. "Some- 
thing’s happening.” At the edge of 
the reeflet, suddenly, like a vanish- 
ing ghost .... puff! There was a 
soundless explosion of faint, misty 
fog. And a colony of flying fish, a 
lacy pattern of vines, a clump of 
blossoms with liquid gold in their 
cups — they fluttered, shook, flung 
madly away; and then that corner, 
too, was still; but it was dead. 

The shape of the bubble had 
changed. One corner of their little 
world had lost its air — poof! — 
like the winking of an eye. For one 
eternal moment Ryeland thought 
that this was what they had been 
waiting for. The spaceling, Chiquita, 
had died at last; the strange forces 
that allowed her to hold air about 
her, and them, had loosened their 
grasp, and they were faee to face 
with death. Donna, who felt the 
abrupt clutch of fear, clung to him 
tightly. 

But Ryeland whispered thought- 
fully, "It isn’t right, Donna. Some- 
thing’s happening, but not what we 
expected at .all. If the field went, it 
should go all at once.” 

"But what could it be, then, Ste- 
ven?” 

"Let’s go see!” Like biped space- 
lings themselves, they turned and 
dove into the cavern. Quickly, quick- 
ly. Crazed, confused thoughts float- 
ed through Ryeland’s mind: Their 



dying little world ... all worlds, dy- 
ing ... all the planets of the sun, 
doomed to death, doomed because 
Ryeland had failed to give them in- 
ertialess travel in time . doomed 
to die without giving seed to space. 

They stopped, clutching at palely 
glowing vines. 

In the very green darkness Chi- 
quita lay. She was surely dead. 
There was no possibility of a mis- 
take. 

But beside her — 

Beside her something moved! Be- 
side that shrunken, lifeless skin, 
something quivered, curled and lift- 
ed. It came frolicking toward them, 
flying — something small, smaller 
even than Donna, a mere doll be- 
side the dead Chiquita, racked and 
shrunken though she was. 

It was a spaceling! 

A baby spaceling! Its red nose 
winked swiftly; it looked at them 
with bright, friendly eyes. "Oh, you 
darling!” cried Donna, holding 
out her arms to it, and it licked at 
her face with a slim, quick, black 
tongue. 

"Look there!” croaked Ryeland, 
astonished beyond words, pointing. 
There was another tiny, seal-like 
creature . and a third, and a 
fourth, and — there seemed to be 
a dozen of them, frolicking and dart- 
ing with their tiny noses blinking 
comically, pink light and orange, red 
and almost purple. 

Ryeland said softly: "Chiquita 

may be dead, but her children are 
not.” 

There were eight of them in all, 
as well as they could count their 
quicksilver, gamboling shapes. Eight 




baby spacelings, frolicking like pups. 
Had they been born after the death 
of the mother, in some reproductive 
mystery of the spacelings*’ Had they 
been born before, and wandered 
off? Ryeland could not know. He 
only knew that they were here. 

“Thank heaven,” whispered Don- 
na, as Ryeland carried one out into 
the light to see it. 

“Thank Something,” murmured 
Ryeland. “Look, Donna. They’re 
just like adult spacelings, but 
tiny. Born fully formed — obvi- 
ously, they are able to maintain a 
field, able to use the jetless drivel 
Fortunately for us. Though,” he said 
remembering the lost corner of their 
paradise, “I think they could stand a 
little more practice.” 

He stopped, looking up, jaw hang- 
ing. 

Out there somewhere past the 
air curtain, something moved and 
winked. 

“The Plan rocket!” cried Donna 
in terror. 

“No! No,” shouted Ryeland, leap- 
ing up. “Don’t you see? It’s too small 
too close. It’s a spaceling! Quiveras 
has come back, and — look! There’s 
someone else. He has brought Don- 
derevo back with him!” 

D onderevo! Six feet eight inches 
tall, a dark-faced man with 
blue eyes that blazed. His spaceling 
brought him daintily into the air bub- 
ble of their little haven, and Ron 
Donderevo sprang free. “Donna!” 
he cried, and caught her hand. 

Joyously Donna threw her arms 
about him, pressing her face against 
his bronzed cheek. When she drew 



free, she said: “Ron, this is Steve 
Ryeland.” 

“I remember,” Ryeland whis- 
pered breathlessly. “When I was a 
Technicub, about eight years old. 
And you were a medical student 
from space, wearing a collar because 
your people hadn’t accepted the 
Plan — ” 

Chuckling, the huge man gripped 
his hand. Ron Donderevo’s fringed 
leather jacket was open at the 
throat. His neck was a brown mus- 
cular column. A thin scar circled it, 
but he wore no collar. 

“And I remember you,” Dondere- 
vo rumbled. “I admired your father. 
A philosopher and a historian, as 
well as a mathematician. He’s the 
scholar who helped me understand 
the real meaning of the space fron- 
tier.” 

“Your collar?” Ryeland interrupt- 
ed him. “You really got out of it?” 

“Out of the collar, and out of the 
place they call Heaven.” Donderevo 
nodded solemnly. “I was luckier than 
your father.” 

“I was never told what became of 
him.” 

R yeland caught his breath to 
ask another question, but the 
sudden iron constriction of his own 
collar stopped him. He wanted to 
know how Donderevo had got away, 
but he was afraid to know the an- 
swer. He was afraid that Donderevo 
would confirm the strange story of 
Angela Zwick — that Ryeland was 
the imitation man that the anti-Plan 
surgeons had assembled in Donder- 
evo’s collar, to cover his escape. 
“Ron?” Donna’s voice was quick 

103 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 




and quivering with concern. “Can 
you get Steve out of his collar?” 

“Not quite the way I was taken 
out of mine.” Ron Donderevo shook 
his shagged, craggy head. “Mine was 
removed in the surgical center at 
the stockpile where I had been sent 
for salvage. Half a dozen surgeons 
helped, using the best equipment — ” 

“What was done with your col- 
lar?” Ryeland interrupted. 

“I promised not to tell,” Donder- 
evo said. 

“Was a patch — ?” Ryeland had 
to gulp and start again. “Was a patch- 
work man assembled in it? A kind 
of living dummy to take your place 
until the spaceling could carry you 
away?” 

“Right.” The big man nodded cas- 
ually. “I don’t suppose it matters to 
anybody now.” 

It mattered very much to Rye- 
land. His flesh turned numb and cold 
... as it must have been before it 
was sutured and cemented back into 
the likeness of a man. His knees felt 
weak. 

“What’s wrong, Steve?” Donna 
asked. “You look so pale!” 

He couldn’t tell her that he was 
that decoy, that patchwork of junk 
meat. 

“I was hoping you could take my 
collar off,” he told Donderevo. That 
was a matter desperate enough to 
account for his agitation. “If you 
learned medicine on Earth, can’t 
you — can’t you possibly do the op- 
eration?” 

Donderevo started to shake his 
head, and suddenly looked hard at 
Ryeland’s face. He glanced at Don- 
na, and peered again at Ryeland. 



His own face twitched and stiffened, 
gray beneath the bronze. 

“I suppose I could try,” he ad- 
mitted reluctantly. “Of course you 
understand that I lack the exper- 
ience and the fine equipment those 
surgeons had. Operating here, with 
only a portable surgery, without 
trained assistants, I can promise you 
one chance in four that you’ll sur- 
vive the operation — one chance in 
five that you’ll walk again, even if 
you do survive.” 

Ryeland fell dizzily back against 
a great crystal branch. Twittering 
iridescent bird-fish, jarred loose, 
swam tinkling away. 

“And yet,” rumbled Donderevo 
compassionately, “you are right, 
Steve, for you have no chance other- 
wise. The Plan can kill you in ten 
seconds, as easy as that. The rocket 
is less than three million miles away. 
Push a button — poof! — your code 
impulse is transmitted — you’re 
dead. And so am I,” he said earnest- 
ly, “and poor Quiveras here, and 
Donna. So you are right, for you see, 
Steven, we must save you somehow 
or you may kill us all.” 

“Describe it to me,” said Ryeland 
emptily. “Tell me what it entails. 
Exactly.” 

D onderevo hesitated, and then 
began. 

Ron Donderevo, that huge man, 
his hands soft as a maiden’s, his 
voice deep as a tiger’s growl; Ron 
Donderevo had performed many an 
operation for the Plan. 

But on Earth, in the Body Bank, 
he said with meticulous care, there 
were things that could not be dup- 



104 



IF 




Heated here. There were nurses and 
surgeons beyond counting. (Here was 
only young Donna and old Quiver- 
as, neither of them trained.) There 
was equipment by the warehouse- 
fuH. Here was only what had been 
packed in on the back of spacelings. 
Enough, yes — if nothing went 
wrong. But there were no extras. If 
a blood pump should fail, there was 
no other. There in the Body Bank 
was the unmatched reservoir of hu- 
man parts that constituted a reserve 
against spoilage. And here were only 
the four of them, and no more parts 
than they needed to go around. 

The first step, he said, would be 
to create an atmosphere of asepsis 
around the anesthetized Ryeland. 
Easy enough, particularly in the 
negligible gravity of the spaceling’s 
bubble, and particularly where the 
only ambient germs were those the 
four of them had brought in. A soft 
hissing from a yellowish metal tube 
Donderevo had brought — he dem- 
onstrated it — accounted for a poly- 
antibiotic spray. 

Then — scalpels, retractors, su- 
tures, clamps. Sterile and inherently 
inhospitable to microscopic life, they 
came out of the gleaming containers 
at Donderevo’s orders. Donna was 
whitefaced but steady as she listened 
and looked at the instruments. She 
shrank away as he described how 
the first scalpel would trace a thin 
red line around Ryeland’s neck, just 
under the collar; but then she was 
all right. 

The epidermis and dermis would 
have to be slit and pulled back, like 
a stocking from a leg. Red flesh 
and white muscle would swiftly be 



cut and retracted. The great trape- 
zius muscles would have to be cut, 
caught and held — it was important 
that muscles be kept under tension. 
The small blood vessels of the neck 
needed to be tied off; ,the large ones 
— the carotids, the jugular the ver- 
tebral blood supply — were to be 
cut and quickly clamped to the plas- 
tic tubes of a double-chambered 
mechanical heart — not because 
Ryeland’s own heart was out of cir- 
cuit, yet, but because there was 
blood loss, Qonstantly, from every 
vessel and uncountable capillary, 
from the disturbed cells themselves. 
Extra reserves of blood were need- 
ed and held in the mechanical heart’s 
chambers, for a man’s own heart 
was not equal to the task. 

Then the nerves, carefully dissect- 
ed out and clamped to the wondrous 
organic silver leads that alone had 
made major replacement of parts 
possible. Nervous tissue does not 
readily regenerate in the higher ver- 
tebrates — not without help. Organ- 
ic silver is the solder that holds the 
parts together; organic silver in the 
form of braided wire strands is the 
“connection” that permits the exten- 
sion of a nerve, so that performance 
is not lost during surgery. As the 
cervical ganglia were cut, great sec- 
tions of Ryeland’s body would con- 
vulse quiveringly. 

Then the bones. Sonic saws to 
slice into the third cervical vertebra. 
The spinal cord — opened, sealed, 
tied. The fluid dammed inside its 
chamber — 

“That’s enough,” interrupted Rye- 
land, his face frozen into a mask. “I 
get the picture. I don’t need any 



THE REEfS OF SPACE 



105 




more.” His eyes sought Donna’s, 
and lie tried to speak to her . but 
could not. “Go ahead,” he said. “Op- 
erate!” 

He stepped forward, swung him- 
self onto the operating cradle and 
lay patiently while Donderevo and 
Quiveras strapped him in. Then Don- 
derevo nodded and Donna moved 
forward, her face trembling on the 
verge of repressed tears, in her hand 
the soft flexible mask that sealed his 
lips and plugged his nostrils. He 
moved his head aside quickly. 
“Good-by, my dearest,” he whis- 
pered. “For a while.” Then he al- 
lowed her to fit the mask. 

Crashing, crashing, the crystal 
trees swam down on him. The little 
reeflet folded into a bud, with him- 
self in the heart of it like the pure 
liquid gold in the cup of one of its 
strange flowers . 

And he was unconscious. 

>CIX 

H e was unconscious. But his mind 
was racing on. 

He was dreaming. He was re- 
membering. The haunting fog came 
swirling up out of the past. It had 
followed him all the way from Earth. 
It was all around him now. cold and 
silent and clinging It covered Don- 
na and Ron Donderevo. and dis- 
torted them Everything changed, 
twisted into hopeless contradiction. 

He was no longer in the portable 
surgery. Now the straps that held 
him were those of the therapy couch 
in the recreation center. The people 
over him were Dr. Thrale and Gen- 
eral Fleemer. 



“Tell us, Ryeland,” Thrale’s soft 
insistent voice was wheezing. “We 
know about the knocking on the 
door, after the teletype girl left 
your office to bring sandwiches and 
coffee. We know you left the papers 
on your desk and went to open the 
door. Tell us who came in.” 
Suddenly, he knew. 

Somehow, the anesthetic had 
cleared away that clinging fog. It 
wasn’t Angela Zwick! It wasn’t even 
the Plan Police — they really hadn’t 
come until the following Monday. It 
was a thin man in a blood-spotted 
fatigue uniform, bent under the 
bulging weight of a soiled space bag. 
“Horrocks — ” 

“Shhh!” 

Ryeland let him into the room and 
locked the door again. Horrocks 
dropped the space bag and stood 
leaning on the desk. He was panting 
heavily. Droplets of red foam 
sprayed out of his mouth and spat- 
tered over the sheafs of yellow tele- 
tape on the desk. 

“You’re hurt,” Ryeland said. “Let 
me get a doctor.” 

“That can wait,” Dan Horrocks 
gasped. “I’ve got a message for you 
— that’s got more priority. From an 
old — friend of yours.” 

Ryeland helped him into a chair 
and listened to the message. It came 
in gasped words that were some- 
times incoherent. The old friend was 
Ron Donderevo. Horrocks had met 
him at a tiny colony on an unchart- 
ed asteroid twenty billion miles out- 
side the Plan, when Colonel Les- 
cure’s ship had stopped there to pick 
up reaction mass 

The message itself took a long 

IF 



106 




time for the stricken man to deliver, 
and longer still for Ry eland to grasp. 
It began with the existence of the 
Reefs of Space and the fusorian life 
that had built them. The point of it 
was the way the spacelings flew. 

“Donderevo wants you to know 
space isn’t dead,” Horrocks panted 
hoarsely. “A living frontier — alive 
and infinite. Rockets can’t — can’t 
reach it usefully. We’ve got to have 

— propulsion — with no reaction 
mass.” 

In the dream he tried to tell the 
wounded man that any sort of jet- 
less drive was forbidden by the Third 
Law of Motion. 

“Wrong — ” the wounded man in- 
terrupted him. “Spacelings — fly! 
Donderevo said — tell you that. 
All you need to know. Except the 
fact — your father taught him. The 
historic effect — effect of the free 
front — ” 

Horrocks coughed, spraying Rye- 
land with flecks of red. 

“Sorry!” he gasped. “Mean fron- 
tier. Closed frontier — closed so- 
ciety. That’s the Plan.” He paused 
to cough again, turning painfully 
away from Ryeland. “Open frontier 

— that’s the reefs. Freedom. For- 
ever!” * 

Ryeland needed time to under- 
stand that agonized summary of a 
fundamental fact, but later, when he 
began to grasp it, he thought he 
knew what had happened to his fa- 
ther. The Plan existed to regiment 
the closed society that had spread 
to the last frontier that rockets could 
reach. His father had seen the in- 
finite promise of the new frontier 
of interstellar space — but even a 



dream of that open frontier was 
treason to the closed world of the 
Plan. 

“Donderevo knows Planner — 
Creery,” Horrocks finished faintly. 
“Thinks we can trust — trust him to 
understand — that man is .more — 
important than the Plan. If we can 
show him a working drive. But he 
says — he says trust — nobody — 
nobody else.” 

E ven after his message was deliv- 
ered, Horrocks didn’t want a doc- 
tor. He let Ryeland give him a eu- 
biotic emergency shot from the sur- 
vival kit that he had stolen from the 
Cristobal Colon, and hid in the rest 
room across the corridor before 
Angela Zwick came back with the 
sandwiches and coffee. By the time 
Ryeland had got rid of her, Hor- 
rocks was gone. 

The message was unbelievable — 
but Horrocks had left the red-spat- 
tered space bag. Ryeland dumped it 
on his desk, and shivered with won- 
der. There was a great, glowing oc- 
tahedral crystal of carbon coral. 
There were dazzling stereos of reefs 
and pyropods and spacelings. There 
was a notebook of Ron Donderevo’s 
observations, proving that the space- 
lings really flew without reaction. 

Forced to believe, Ryeland’s mind 
reacted. As Donderevo had told 
Horrocks to tell him, all he needed 
to know was the fact that the space- 
lings flew. With that simple datum 
actually accepted, the rest was ob- 
vious. 

As a mathematician, he knew that 
equations had to balance. As a 
physicist, however, he had learned 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



107 




that the balancing quantity might be 
physically elusive. The neutrino, re- 
quired to balance the equations of a 
nuclear reaction, was one such ex- 
ample. In his own equations of 
mass-creation and space-expansion, 
which described the Hoyle effect, 
the new mass equalled x — an un- 
known quantity, more elusive than 
even the neutrino, which he had 
failed to identify in nature. 

B..t now he saw it. Printed in the 
simple fact of the spaceling’s flight, 
it was plain as the fact that two 
plus two is four. The unknown quan- 
tity which equalled the new mass in 
his equations was at last identified. 

It was momentum! The momen- 
tum of the expanding universe, which 
ultimately pushed the receeding gal- 
axies beyond the velocity of light! 

With a professional satisfaction, 
he noted that the Third Law of Mo- 
tion had not been violated. It had 
simply been transformed. The kinet- 
ic energy of the flying spaceling was 
balanced by a precisely equivalent 
energy of new mass. The reaction 
was governed by the classical equa- 
tion of energy and mass, E= mc2. 
The enormous last factor, the 
squared velocity of light, meant that 
a tiny mass was the equivalent of 
enormous kinetic energy. That was 
what had made his x so hard to 
identity. On its longest jetless flight, 
a spaceling would add only an im- 
perceptible breath of new hydrogen 
to the cloud of atoms that its own 
motion had created. 

L ocked alone in his office. Rye- 
land went to work. A surging 
elation had swept away all his fa- 

108 



tigue, and even the fear that Hor- 
rocks had brought. That single sub- 
stitution of momentum for the un- 
known quantity in his own cosmo- 
logical equations had given him the 
theory. A simple transformation des- 
cribed the field conditions required 
for the creation of new mass and 
the equivalent momentum. The prob- 
lems of material and design were 
more troublesome, but by Sunday 
noon he had set up the complete 
specifications for a reactionless pro- 
pulsion system with an effective 
thrust of half a million tons. 

Suddenly hungry and groggy, he 
stumbled across the hushed dimness 
of the tunnel to wash his face in 
the laboratory that had not been 
scrubbed since Horrocks had sprayed 
the basin with blood. He ate the last 
dry beef algae sandwich, and the last 
bitter drops of cold yeast coffee and 
went to sleep in his chair, wondering 
dully how to go about reaching Plan- 
ner Creery without trusting anybody 
else. 

He woke early Monday morning 
with a stiff neck and the fading rec- 
ollection of a nightmare in which he 
had been running with Horrocks 
from the Plan Police. He hid the 
space bag behind a filing cabinet, 
stuffed the blood-sprayed teletapes 
into the incinerator, and packed his 
specifications and the stereos in his 
briefcase. 

Two hours before the time for 
Angela and Oporto to come, he hur- 
ried away, into the maze of gray- 
walled tunnels that housed all the 
linked computers of the Planning 
Machine and the working quarters 
of the Planner’s staff. 



IF 




Trust nobody . 

The tunnels were dim and empty. 
Cool air roared here and there from 
the ducts. The Monday morning 
white-collar rush hadn’t begun, but 
now and then he met a maintenance 
man in gray coveralls. It was strange 
to think of the solid miles of Earth 
above, when he had the key to the 
stars in his hands. 

Though he had never been to the 
Planner’s office, he knew the way. 
Outside the automatic elevator, a 
guard looked at him sharply and 
waved him on past the warning 
sign: RESTRICTED! RISKS RE- 
QUIRE ESCORT BEYOND THIS 
POINT. 

He was not a Risk. He wore no 
security collar. 

Outside the Planner’s suite, an- 
other guard studied his badge and 
tapped the number into a teletype. 
Waiting for the Machine to answer, 
Ryeland held his breath. But the 
guard looked up from the clatter- 
ing machine, with a reluctant re- 
spect easing his official frown. 

‘‘Go in, sir.” 

A teletype girl in the waiting room 
wanted to know his business. He in- 
formed her that he had a confiden- 
tial report^ for Planner Creery. She 
wanted to know the nature of it. 
When he insisted that it was too 
confidential for any ears except the 
Planner’s, she made an appointment 
for him to see an executive asso- 
ciate. 

The executive associate was a 
huge, blue-faced frog of a man. A 
polished wood slab on his desk was 
impressively lettered: General Ru- 
dolph Fleemer. His bulging eyes 




THE REEFS OF SPACE 



109 







were sharp, with a quick curiosity 
about Ryeland’s confidential report. 

Unfortunately, Planner Creery 
had not returned from a weekend 
cruise with his family. He would 
doubtless be in his office later in the 
week, but even then pressure of ac- 
cumulated work would be extreme. 
Although Planner Creery was well 
aware that Ryeland’s distinguished 
achievements in helical field engi- 
neering had been useful to the Plan, 
the extent of his duties forced him 
to delegate most responsibilities to 
subordinates. General Fleemer im- 
plied that people who refused to 
trust the Planner’s associates were 
seldom able to see the Planner him- 
self. 

Reluctantly, when he saw that he 
could do no better, Ryelands left a 
message stating that his business in- 
volved Ron Donderevo and a new 
space propulsion system. General 
Fleemer promised sullenly to signal 
him later in the week, if Planner 
Creery chose to see him. 

Noon had passed before Ryeland 
got back to office. If Oporto and 
the teletype girl had come to work, 
he saw no sign of them. The blood- 
spattered space bag was still in place 
behind the filing cabinet, and a long 
yellow strip of teletape from the un- 
tended machine was piling up on the 
floor. He locked the office door and 
looked around for a place to hide 
his specifications for the jetless 
drive. 

There was no space behind his ref- 
erence books. The gap between the 
filing cabinet and the wall was al- 
ready dangerously conspicuous. His 
desk had no drawers. In fact, he re- 



flected, there was no room in the 
Plan for personal secrets or private 
documents. He found no hiding 
place — none better than his mem- 
ory. 

He was dropping the specifica- 
tions into the incinerator slot, when 
he heard the loud impatient knock- 
ing on his door . 

A gain in the dream he was an 
unwilling guest in the deeply 
buried recreation center. The suites 
on both sides of him were occupied 
by disloyal surgeons who had been 
trapped in some plot against the 
Plan. The therapy room down the 
tunnel held the unplanned thing that 
they had assembled from scraps of 
waste tissue, which raved insanely in 
its straps and bandages while it was 
alive. 

Then the surgeons were gone. 
There was only Horrocks, in the 
next suite, and Oporto in the one 
across the corridor. He was seldom 
aware even of them, because the 
stewards kept him most of the time 
in the therapy room where the junk 
man had died. 

He was strapped to the couch, 
with the iron collar on his neck and 
electrodes clamped to his shivering 
flesh. Merciless light blazed down on 
his face. The white-smocked fat 
therapist stood over him, wheezing 
questions in a soft apologetic voice. 

What was the message that Hor- 
rocks had brought him from Ron 
Donderevo? Where were fusorians 
and pyropods and spacelings? What 
was the way to build a jetless drive? 

At first he could have answered, 
but a burning shock from the collar 



110 



IF 




paralyzed his voice whenever he 
tried to speak. Even when he was 
utterly broken, abjectly willing to 
trust anybody with what he knew, 
they wouldn’t let him say a word. 
They gave him no chance to under- 
stand, left him no will even to dream 
of escape. 

Donderevo? Reefs of space? Jet- 
less drive? 

The soft insistent voice and the 
agony went on, until all his past was 
lost in a fog of pain and insane con- 
tradiction. Even when the collar 
didn’t shock him, he didn’t try to 
speak. He didn’t even try to think of 
the answer. His mind had been 
erased. 

XX 

R yeland awoke, blinking against a 
glare of light and found a man 
in white bending over him. 

It took him a long time to under- 
stand that it was not Dr. Thrale, 
but Donderevo; longer still to rea- 
lize that the crystal glint and glow- 
ing color of the cave was right and 
natural, so sure he had been that he 
would find himself in the aseptic 
white of the therapy room. He was 
in the opetating cradle. The straps 
on his body had been loosened. 
Things began to click into place. 
There was Donderevo, yes, and the 
girl with her back to him undoubt- 
edly was Donna Creery, and the 
other figure — 

He sat up involuntarily, eyes wide. 
For the third figure in the room was 
not Quiveras. It was a Technicorps 
officer, watching him with the calcu- 
lation of a poised cobra. 



With a sudden spasm of desperate 
hope and fear Ryeland’s hands came 
up to his neck. 

They touched the familiar hard 
curve of the collar. He still wore it. 
He was still a Risk, his ”^e hanging 
on the whim of every guard ^with a 
radar pistol or on the flipover of a 
relay in the distant synapses of the 
Machine. 

“What — ” For a moment his 
voice was paralyzed, still half in the 
dream, remembering the violence of 
the shocks that had conditioned him 
not to speak the truths he knew. But 
he fought to get words out: “What 
went wrong?” 

Donderevo said compassionately, 
“We were too late. Before we had 
more than started the spacelings let 
us know the Plan cruiser was near- 
by. It breached the bubble around 
this reeflet. We sewed you up, and 
now we are all back in the Plan of 
Man.” Unconsciously his hand 
touched the scar on his own throat. 
“I’m sorry about your collar. Rye- 
land,” he said, “but if I’m not mis- 
taken it will be no long time be- 
fore I’m once more wearing one of 
my own.” 

The nurse turned, and Ryeland^ 
had his third shock. For it was not 
Donna. “Where is she?” he de- 
manded. 

“Safe,” rumbled Donderevo. “Or 
as safe as any one under the Plan. 
Her father was in the cruiser. She’s 
with him now.” 

“May I — ” Ryeland had to stop 
and gulp, because a memory of 
agony had paralyzed his throat. 
“May I see them?” 

“I’ll tell them you’re awake,” 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



m 




Donderevo said. He moved toward 
the doorway, and turned back with 
a hesitant expression. “I had better 
warn you that you can’t expect 
much help from Creery. You see, 
he’s not the Planner any longer. In 
fact, he’s wearing a collar of his 
own.” 

R yeland was sitting on the 
edge of the portable cradle with 
a sheet wrapped around him, when 
Donna brought her father into that 
crystal-lighted cave of space. Though 
the former Planner was smiling ten- 
derly at his daughter, his face looked 
pinched and gray. He wore the thin 
denim of a Risk. The chrome-steel 
collar shimmered with reflected 
crystal glints. 

Two officious men followed 
Creery. One was a stocky Techni- 
corps colonel, who looked bleakly 
Satanic with his radar horns. The 
other was a communications ser- 
geant, with a gray-cased portable 
teleset slung to his body. 

Donna nervously repeated what 
Donderevo had already told Rye- 
land about her father’s arrival. 

‘‘I was hoping,” she finished wist- 
fully, “that Father could unlock your 
collar.” 

“Not even my own.” Creery’s stiff 
smile faded. “You can see that 
things have changed Our old friend 
General Fleemer is acting Planner 
now. I have been reclassified, and 
assigned to this hazardous special 
mission.” He glanced uncomfortably 
back at the colonel. 

Donna’s face twitched. She whis- 
pered, “What’s your special mission, 
Father?” 



“It is concerned with the Plan of 
Man,” he said. “You see, since the 
Machine had been reliably informed 
of the limitless extent of the Reefs 
of Space, it has been projecting a 
new phase of the Plan. In this sec- 
ond phase, the abundant resources 
of the space frontier will end any 
need for the strict regimentation of 
the original Plan. Unfortunately, this 
second phase cannot begin until the 
new frontier is actually open to the 
masses of mankind. Obviously, that 
requires a reactionless space drive.” 
The former Planner paused. His 
haggard eyes looked sharply at Don- 
derevo, regretfully at Ryeland, 
blankly at the Technicorps colonel. 

“General Fleemer managed to 
convince the Machine that I was 
no longer competent,” he "^said. “I 
suppose you know about the num- 
erous failures of the helical field 
equipment that you had designed.” 
His dull stare came back to Ryeland. 
“Fleemer laid all those disasters at 
my feet. As a result of such apparent 
executive errors, I was replaced. 

“I insisted on one last chance to 
find a reactionless drive. I had 
enough power left so that Fleemer 
was unable to block the assignment. 
That’s my mission now. I saw the 
spacelings that came out to meet the 
cruiser. I must learn how they fly!” 
His voice was hopeless. 

“If Ryeland couldn’t find the 
answer,” Donderevo said, “I doubt 
that it exists.” 

“But — I found it!” 

T he collar was very tight. For 
a moment Ryeland’s throat was 
paralyzed again. The old fog of 




agony and contradiction thickened 
in his mind. He looked at the man 
and at Donna. Her smile was sun- 
shine, clearing the fog. 

He remembered. He could speak. 

He explained his theory of the 
equivalence of momentum and new 
mass, which related the flight of the 
spacelings to the expansion of the 
universe. He recited the specifica- 
tions that he had memorized before 
the Plan Police burst into his office 
on that lost Monday. 

The colonel watched, a skeptical 
Satan, while they discussed the de- 
sign and dictated the specifications 
to the sergeant at the portable tele- 
set. They waited, while the message 
was digested by the special section 
of the Planning Machine aboard the 
cruiser. 

Time passed — while slow radio 
pulsed the message to Earth. 

Ryeland looked at Donna 
Creery’s anxious face — and re- 
membered the bandaged patchwork 
man who had raved and died in the 
therapy room down the tunnel from 
his suite in the recreation center. 

Then he himself was not the junk 
man! 

That part of Angela’s story had 
been a malicious lie! 

The teleset clattered. 

Ryeland crowded with the former 
Planner and Donderevo and the girl 
to read the tape. Officiously, the 
colonel waved them back. He 
peered at the tape, and reached to 
finger the buttons of his radar gear. 

But his expression changed. 

^T knew it, Mr. Planner.” His voice 
was suddenly smoothly affable. ‘T 
knew that Fleemer was nothing bet- 



ter than a conniving traitor, who will 
certainly get his comeuppance now! 
Any man with a spark of wit knew 
that jetless flight had to come.” 

Grinning, he offered his hand to 
Creery. 

‘T want to be the first to congrat- 
ulate you, Mr. Planner. And -you, 
too, Mr. Ryeland. The special sec- 
tion of the Planning Machine in the 
cruiser has completed its prelimin- 
ary evaluation of your invention. 

‘Tt has relayed a message to the 
master complex of the Machine on 
Earth, alerting it to prepare the Plan 
of Man for transition to the second 
phase, in which the freedom of the 
space frontier will render our pres- 
ent strict security controls both im- 
possible and unnecessary. 

“As a first step toward the effect- 
uation of that second phase, it is 
propagating a radar pulse — ” 

Ryeland heard a click at his 
throat. 

His collar snapped open. 

As if moved by the same pulse, 
the girl stepped forward and into his 
arms. Together they moved out of 
the cave into the faerie shimmer of 
the reeflet. To one side hung the 
great gray mass of the Plan cruiser, 
no longer an enemy. Beyond lay the 
stars. 

Tte stars. The limitless frontier 
for mankind — the space between 
suns, where hydrogen is constantly 
born to make new worlds, as free- 
dom is constantly born in the hearts 
of men. 

“A billion billion new worlds,” 
whispered Ryeland. 

And the girl said firmly: “Our 
children will see them all!” END

Loot beyond avarice, raw

there had to be a catch! 



I 

CCT’d like you to meet Professor 
A Aylward of Copernicus Ob- 
servatory,” said Angus. 

Up td that point, Captain Mar- 
tinu had seriously been considering 
leaving the party. The band was 
much too loud. The dancing was far 
too energetic for someone like him- 
self, who was used to long periods 
of free fall that wasted the muscles. 
And the promise of interesting peo- 



ple to talk to, with which Angus had 
persuaded him to come along, had 
not been fulfilled. 

Now, though, he felt a sudden stir 
of interest as he shook the hand of 
the short, bespectacled, balding sci- 
entist. He said, “You mean you’re 
the Aylward they named the Ayl- 
ward Field after?” 

“Er — ” Aylward looked uncom- 
fortable. “Well, as a matter of fact, 
yes, I am.” 

“As a result of which,” Angus said,

•'I owe you my life, among other 
things.” He ran his hand through his 
shock of coarse black hair, which 
stuck up from his head, in the cur- 
rently fashionable Fijian style, like a 
chimney-sweep’s brush. 

Martinu said, “And I owe you a 
couple of billion dollars. We picked 
up a buster with your field in the 
old Castor, when I was a junior en- 
gine tech.” 

Rather diffidently, Aylward eyed 
the other’s immaculate uniform. 
“And stayed on in the space service? 
he said. “Isn’t that unusual?” 

“Oh, unique!” Martinu agreed 
with a trace of pride. “I’m the only 
man in the service who’s picked up a 
buster and not immediately bought 
himself out of a career job. I say, 
is there anything I can do for you?” 

Aylward seemed to be in some 
distress, his breathing deep and ster- 
torous, his shoulders hunching for- 
ward. He said, “You can help me to 
a chair, if you will. I’ve been on 
Luna for the past seventeen years. 
Full gravity makes me terribly 
tired.” 

Martinu hastily took the profes- 
sor’s arm. He was in top physical 
condition — had to be — but even so 
he was quickly exhausted by a couple 
of hours on his feet, so he could ap- 
preciate Aylward’s discomfort. An- 
gus, as always, had vanished the mo- 
ment he saw a conversation starting 
and gone to spark another one else- 
where. 

There was a vacant double seat in 
the nearest of the alcoves off the 
dance floor. Martinu headed for it. 
There was a couple engaged in vio- 
lent love-making on the other seat 



but he ignored their looks of irrita- 
tion as he sat Aylward down. He 
said, “Let me get you a drink.” 

“That’s very kind of you,” said 
Aylward. He wiped sweat from his 
forehead with a bandanna handker- 
chief matching his Mexican-styled 
cummerbund. “A long cool one, for 
choice.” 

“Will do,” said Martinu, and went 
in search of a waiter. 

He was on his way back with the 
drinks when Angus, a look of anx- 
iety on his long face, pushed through 
a cluster of other guests and caught 
his arm. 

“Martinu, I guess I should warn 
you about old Aylward. I mean, he’s 
a nice guy and a genius and all that. 
But like a lot of geniuses he’s a bit 
nutty on one point. Unfortunately 
you’ve hit it right away.” 

“What? Busters?” 

“Yes. He has a perfectly absurd 
theory about what they are and 
where they come from. If you get 
him started on it, he’ll bend your 
ear all night.” 

Martinu shrugged. “If he hasn’t 
got a right to theorize about bust- 
ers, who has? Besides, the Aylward 
Field got me a share in one. I reckon 
listening to him for an hour or two 
is a cheap price to pay for that.” 

“Damn it, I had to tell him what 
a buster was, once!” Angus made 
sweeping gesture which spilled his 
drink over the back of his hand. 
Fishing for a handkerchief to dry 
it, he went on, “In fact, if it hadn’t 
been for me — ” 

Something in Martinu’s expres- 
sion warned him. He broke off “I 
guess I told you about that. Sorry. 



116 



IF 




But don’t say I didn’t warn you, will 
you?” 

Martinu grinned and walked on. 

T he lovers had gone, presum- 
ably in search of more privacy. 
He set a tall frosted glass beside the 
professor and sat down himself. “I 
got you julep,” he said. “Is that all 
right?” 

“Perfect.” Aylward produced a 
length of tubing and dropped one 
end into the glass to save himself 
the effort of holding it up while he 
drank. “What are you having?” 
“Slivovitz,” said Martinu. “Sort of 
homage to my Balkan ancestry. 
Anyway, what brings you back to 
Earth after such a long time, pro- 
fessor?” 

“Oh, someone seems to be in- 
fringing the patents on the Field,” 
Aylward answered. “Angus told me 
I was needed, so I came down. He’s 
my agent, you know — and very 
good he is. I don’t know how I’d 
manage without him. I’ve always 
found the world of commerce far 
more complicated than any problem 
in astrophysics, because it’s easier 
to improve your equipment than 
yourself.” 

“You haVe quite a setup at Co- 
pernicus, don’t you? They tell me it’s 
the best - equipped observatory in 
the System, and you financed prac- 
tically all of it yourself. May I in- 
quire — does the Field bring you in 
a good income?” 

Aylward gave a tired smile. “Ex- 
cellent! I never expected so much 
return for so little effort.” 

He drew out the tube from his 
now half-empty glass and began to 



run it absently between his fingers. 
“People sometimes ask me,” he went 
on, “why I stick at my job when I’m 
wealthy enough to live in luxury on 
Earth. I think you’ll probably under- 
stand me when I say I think I 
made a sensible decision.” He 
cocked any eyebrow at Martinu. 

The captain suddenly found him- 
self liking Aylward a lot. He smiled, 
and as he nodded agreement his hair 
bobbed around his face. It was too 
soft for the Fijian style, so he had 
had to settle for curls like a Queen 
Anne wig. Being used to a free-fall 
crewcut he found it a permanent ir- 
ritation. Damn these silly Earthside 
fads! 

“I wouldn’t even have come to 
this party but for Angus’s insistence, 
Aylward went on. “I depend com- 
pletely on him, as I said, and he 
does have this tendency to fly off 
into space over the littlest things . 
We were on the Algol together 
when we located the buster which 
started the whole thing. Did he ever 
tell you the story?” 

Almost, Martinu said, “He’s told 
everybody!” But he checked him- 
self. For one thing, Angus’s version 
of the story had probably been col- 
ored by the passage of time, while 
Aylward’s might give a different 
slant. And for another, though the 
professor’s tone had been conven- 
tionally light, Martinu sensed that 
he was actually aching to find some- 
one to listen to him. Angus had more 
than likely gone around warning all 
his other guests about Aylward’s ob- 
session with the buster problem. 

He set his glass down on his knee. 
“That was when Rusch was in com-

mand, wasn’t it?” he said. “Yes, I’d 
very much like to hear about it.” 

II 

T he radar tech first class at 
number three screen held his 
breath for a long moment. When he 
let it out, it was to speak in a voice 
shaky with excitement. 

“Buster, sir!” he said. 

The lieutenant on the other side of 
the room whipped around and 
bounded over with a hard kick at 
the far wall. He caught the back of 
the tech’s chair with one hand and 
hung there floating, his eyes wide. 
“Where — where do you see it?” he 
demanded. 

“There, sir.” The tech put his fin- 
ger on a large green blip near the 
center of the screen. “It broke 
through about ten seconds ago. I 
saw it arrive. And the range and 
mass are exactly right.” 

He hardly waited for an answer 
before shouting to the orderly at 
the phone desk. 

“Green, get me a line to the 
bridge!” 

“Aye-aye, sir,” said the orderly 
unemotionally. 

The lieutenant turned to the 
screen again. He said, “What’s the 
range?” 

“About four and a half kil, sir. 
Right under our feet.” 

The lieutenant whistled. “Well, 
for sure it didn’t sneak up on us. 
Read it for relative velocity, will 
you?” 

The tech slid cross-hairs over the 
screen, centered on the blip, pressed 
the switch of the doppler integrator. 



They waited the necessary five sec- 
onds and a figure went up on the 
dial. 

“Six hundred,” the lieutenant said 
“Hasn’t settled into its natural orbit 
yet. I think — ” 

He was going to say he thought 
the tech was right, but the commun- 
ications orderly interrupted. “Bridge, 
sir!” 

“Chuck it over,” said the lieuten- 
ant, and picked the phone put of 
the air as it soared across the room. 
He continued into it, “Ahmed, 
screen-room watch, sir. One of my 
techs thinks we’re on a buster.” 
“Hah!” said Captain Rusch skep- 
tically. “How are we doing for white 
whales this week?” 

“It showed up without warning on 
number three screen at four and a 
half kilomiles, sir. We haven’t had a 
chance to check its orbit yet, but its 
relative velocity is only six hundred. 

There was a pause. At length 
Rusch grunted. “Right, I’ll get a 
’scope on it,” he said. “Bearing?” 
“Oh seven-six and a half, sir.” 
“Thank you. Lieutenant. I’ll let 
you know the verdict. Don’t get to 
worked up till we’re sure, will you?” 
That, of course, was a pious hope, 
Rusch reflected as he gave the 
bridge phone back to his own com- 
munications orderly. He could tell 
from the expressions on the faces 
around him. Even the normally plac- 
id Commander Gabrilov, who had 
been close enough to hear what 
Ahmed said, was showing excite- 
ment. 

“Okay,” Rusch said. “O-kay. I 
don’t have to say it again.” 

Gabrilov gave a shamefaced grin 



lie 



IF 




and pushed himsell over to the 
’scope controls. *‘Oh-seven ... six 
and a half,” he said under his breath 
as he set them. “Four and a half 
kil . Yes, there’s something there 
all right.” 

“Get it on the screens,” Rusch 
said. “Come on now!” He felt his 
heart pounding faster as he glanced 
at the big screen mounted over the 
pilot board at the forward end of 
the bridge. A click. An ill-defined, 
misshapen object appeared in the 
center of the square frame. It could 
have been anything out of the aster- 
oid belt. 

There was a long silence. At last 
Gabrilov said, “Do you think it 
could really be a buster?” 

“Well, why the hell don’t you 
take steps to find out?” Rusch 
snapped. 

Gabrilov colored. “Sorry, sir!” he 
mumbled. He barked at the commu- 
nications orderly. “Tell Warrant Of- 
ficer Fisher to draw power for a 
laser beam! Ask Lieutenant Ahmed 
to stand by for spectroanalysis!” 

“Aye-aye!” said the orderly fer- 
vently, his eyes bright. 

While they were waiting, Rusch 
glanced at Gabrilov. He said as 
though, there had been no interrup- 
tion, “It could be a buster, of course. 
It’s some while since the last one 
was found, but there have been 
forty-five of fhe things, and they 
turned up all over the System. One 
was found in a lunar equilateral, 
wasn’t it? But even if this is a bust- 
er, you’ve got to remember one 
thing.” 

“What?” 

“They may not all be worth pick- 



ing up. Some of them may only bo 
lumps of iron, for instance. It hasn’t 
happened yet, but it’s possible.” 

Gabrilov bit his lip and looked lu- 
gubrious. 

The communications orderly 
said, “Sir! Screen room!” 

Rusch seized the phone. Gabrilov 
came diving over to hover beside 
him. 

“Get this, sir!” Ahmed’s voice 
said. “Spectroanalysis shows iron — 
cobalt — nickel — ” 

Gabrilov pulled a face, looking 
down at the floor. 

“But also!” Ahmed said trium- 
phantly. “Also silver, gold, uranium 
thorium, platinum, osmium, irid- 
ium . .” 

He went on, but Rusch had low- 
ered the phone. 

“Number forty-six,” he said quiet- 

ly. 

W hatever the reason for all 
that shouting and banging and 
laughing, Aylward wished they 
would stop it and let him concen- 
trate. He was trying to cope with 
more figures than his portable cal- 
culator could handle, and running 
side factors in his head always gave 
him a headache. 

The door of his cabin slammed 
back and Angus burst in, frantic 
with excitement. The chain of fig- 
ures vanished into limbo and Ayl- 
ward clapped his hand to his face. 

“For heaven’s sake, what are you 
playing at?” he snarled. 

“Didn’t you hear?” said Angus, 
braking himself on the far wall with 
his foot and bouncing back towards 
Aylward. “What are you doing?” 



A BEHER MOUSETRAP

‘‘Trying to resolve some sur- 
vey data — if you’ll kindly give me 
the chance to finish the job.” Ayl- 
ward spoke with heavy sarcasm; he 
was an old-young man of thirty-five 
with glasses and an expression which 
was usually mild but now was thun- 
derous. “I never heard such a 
racket!” 

“But we’ve picked up a buster!” 
Angus exclaimed. 

Aylward sighed and pushed his 
papers under a clip to hold them to 
the table before sliding his chair 
back in its guides. “Is that serious?” 
he said. “Does it take long?” 

Angus hooked a leg under the ta- 
bletop and shook his head pitying- 
ly. “Are you trying to say you don’t 
know what a buster is?” he demand- 
ed incredulously. “You can carry an 
ivory-tower pose too far, you 
know!” 

“All right, tell me what it is,” 
Aylward snapped. 

Angus rolled his eyes, but 
shrugged and complied. “Nobody 
knows what they are — exactly. 
They’re lumps of matter that appar- 
ently drop from nowhere. Radar 
doesn’t show them till they’re well 
within detector range, and they 
think this may have something to do 
with the fact that they’re fuller of 
high-number radioactives than a 
pudding is ot plums.” 

“Oh, yes!” Aylward said. “Of 
course Tve heard of them! But there 
haven’t been any for some time, 
have there? What are they like?” 
“Turn your screen on, and you’ll 
see one. Captain Rusch had the 
’scope image piped in for everyone 
to look at.” 



Aylward did so. The screen lit 
with a knife-sharp picture of a 
roughly spherical object, scarred 
across by the sweep of the high- 
powered laser beam. It was approxi- 
mately a hundred feet in diameter. 
Lights from the ship were playing 
on it now, and made it gleam against 
the black depths of space. 

“I wonder how much we’ll get,” 
Angus said in an awed tone. 

“Come again?” 

44''T^hese things contain fabu- 
A lous riches!” Angus gave him 
a supercilious glance. “So your ig- 
norance doesn’t show too much, 
listen and I’ll give you the back- 
ground. 

“The fir^t one was found by the 
Aurora about six years ago. They 
couldn’t believe their eyes when they 
saw it drop out of nowhere — a hun- 
dred-foot ball of concentrated 
wealth. They got thousands of tons 
of platinum out of it, gold, silver, 
uranium, and so many diamonds 
they practically bankrupted the 
commercial manufacturers. All the 
rest — there’ve been forty-five to 
date — have been cast in the same 
mould. The precious metals have 
more or less flooded the market, but 
the demand for radioactives is still 
high, and everyone who’s found a 
buster has become rich for life. 

“After the Aurora case there was 
a gold rush to the asteroid belt — no, 
don’t interrupt, let me finish! But 
you don’t seem to find busters with 
the ordinary planetoids. They 
showed up air over the System. And 
another odd thing — this is the first 
to be discovered in some years, al- 



120 



IF 




though at one time they were being 
found at the rate of about two a 
month. Of course, this is probably a 
statistical accident; they’re virtually 
undetectable until you’re right on 
top of them.” 

Aylward said, “All right, all right! 
I remember no. They predicted 
chaos. But in the event we absorbed 
the impact pretty well.” 

“So well you don’t seem to have 
noticed it at all,” Angus commented 
dryly. 

Aylward ignored the jab. “Just a 
second,” he said. He was frowning, 
for no reason Angus could think of. 
“If forty-five were found, and they 
were coming at an average two per 
month, the rush lasted two years. 
You don’t know the dates of the 
first and last reported findings, do 
you?” 

“Huh?” Angus blinked. “Well, the 
Aurora got the first on twenty-sev- 
enth April, eight-six — uh — and the 
Capella got the forty-fifth some time 
in March of eighty-eight. Middle of 
March — I think the seven- 
teenth. Why?” 

Aylward said, “And it’s ninety-two 
now!” He began frantically unstrap- 
ping himself from his chair. 

“Hey! Where are you off to in 
such a hurry?” 

Aylward looked grim. “Not being 
a seasoned space-traveler,” he said, 
“I was a bit worried before making 
this trip about the number of ships 
that have been lost lately. I looked 
into it fairly closely to make sure I 
had a statistical chance of getting 
home.” 

“What’s that got to do with — ?” 

“Since you have such a good 



memory for dates, you can tell me 
when the current run of losses start- 
ed. They said thirty had gone miss- 
ing in the past four years — more 
than in the preceeding two decades!” 
Bewildered, Angus said, “Sure I 
can tell you. The Dubhe was lost 
on the Venus run some time be- 
tween tenth March and first April of 
eighty-eight.” 

“And the next ship to go?” 

“The Lucifer, She vanished — ” 
He broke off and bit his lip. 

“About two weeks later,” Alyward 
said, kicking himself through the 
door. Angus hung where he was for 
a moment; then he gave a gasp and 
dived in the other’s wake. 

Ill 

T he door of the bridge slid back 
with a squeal of complaint. 
Rusch turned. When he saw who 
the intruder was, he frowned. It was 
all very well to say that young Ayl- 
ward was potentially the greatest 
living authority on theoretical astro- 
physics; it was all very well for him 
to want to make surveys distant 
from the sun — but on simple prin- 
ciple Rusch disapproved of non-serv- 
ice personnel shipping on anything 
other than a proper passenger liner. 

However, the rosy glow attend- 
ant on the discovery of a buster had 
mellowed him to the point at which 
he did not even ask brusquely who 
had authorized Aylward to trespass 
on the bridge. He merely said, “Yes, 
Mr. Aylward? What do you want?” 
“Angus tells me you’ve located 
what they call a buster,” Aylward 
said. His face was pale, and his eyes 



A BEHER MOUSETRAP 



121 




were very wide behind his glasses. 

“Yes, we have,” Rusch agreed. A 
thought struck him, and he called 
to Gabrilov on the other side of the 
room. “I forgot to order ‘splice the 
mainbrace*, Mr. Gabrilov! I imagine 
the men are expecting it.” 

“Aye-aye, sir!” 

“Captain!” Alyward said desper- 
ately. Rusch turned a frosty eye on 
him; he had jumped to the obvious 
conclusion. 

“D o n’t worry, Mr. Aylward. 
There’s enough valuable material in 
that thing out there to keep all of 
us in comfort for the rest of our na- 
tural lives. And spatial law provide 
that non-service personnel are en- 
titled to two-thirds of a crewman’s 
share. All we can do right now is 
stake our claim, of course, and with 
luck tow it into orbit at our destina- 
tion. But we’ll start the mining as 
soon as — ” 

“Captain, if I were you I’d be 
very chary even of staking a claim, 
let alone mining that thing!” Ayl- 
ward regretted that force of habit 
had made him draw his feet down 
to the floor, because the captain 
was floating a foot off it, and so 
looked a long way down at him. 

There was a frigid silence. At 
last Rusch said. “Would you like to 
explain yourself, Mr. Aylward? If 
you can, that is.” 

“Well, it seems to me — ” Ayl- 
ward hesitated how to make this 
clear? Then he plunged on. “Isn’t it 
a fact that no buster has been re- 
ported for four years, though there 
was a positive spate of them before 
that? And didn’t the start of the 
current run of ships lost in space — 



thirty known vessels and who knows 
how many others belonging to pros- 
pectors and freebooters — didn’t 
this coincide with the end of the 
stream of reported busters?” 

“By God, that’s right!” The excla- 
mation came from Gabrilov. “I’m 
sorry, sir,” he added to Rusch. /‘But 
the Dubhe was the first to go since 
they perfected atomics. And I have 
every reason to remember that she 
vanished about a fortnight ^fter the 
forty-fifth buster — the Capella*s. I 
was due to be aboard, but I was 
held back by an ear infection.” 
“The odds against this are tre- 
mendous,” Aylward said. He saw 
that Gabrilov’s interruption had im- 
pressed Rusch, and was in haste to 
seize his momentary advantage. 
“Which is why I think it would be 
terribly dangerous to come too close 
to the buster. Uh — what exactly is 
involved in what you call ‘staking a 
claim’ ?” 

“Just a moment!” Rusch said. 
“Are you envisaging that the buster 
might be unstable and blow up?” 
“Well . .” Aylward looked at the 
floor. “There’s an awful lot of re- 
active material in it, they tell me.” 
“Hmph! It can’t be very sensitive, 
then. We spectroanalyzed it with a 
laser beam intense enough to boil 
some of its surface off. What do you 
think, Gabrilov?” 

G abrilov was silent for a few 
seconds. At length he said, 
“Well, sir — we don’t lose anything 
by being careful. To stake our claim, 
we’d normally match velocities and 
coast in close, wouldn’t we? We’re 
still calculating whether we have 



122 



IF 




enough reaction mass to take the 
thing in tow. But I don’t think we 
have, so we’ll have to send someone 
over and plant an identification bea- 
con — but much of the surface will 
be hot. I see several reasons why we 
should stand well off and take time 
out to program a remote-controlled 
missile to act as a marker.” 

Rusch pondered. ‘‘Yes, it’d be cut- 
ting things fine to try and get some- 
thing that massive into orbit at the 
end of this trip. I was working on 
the assumption that all we could do 
would be to mark her with a long- 
life beacon and come back under no 
load to fetch her . Very well, Mr. 
Aylward. I’ll arrange to send out an 
unmanned lifeboat with the beacon 
in it. There’s enough iron in the 
buster for electromagnets to get a 
grip. And to satisfy your qualms, 
we’ll keep our distance.” 

“Thank you, Captain,” Aylward 
said. He was surprised to find, now 
that he’d made his point, that he was 
shaking all over and his forehead 
was slippery with sweat. 

They tied the lifeboat controls di- 
rectly in to the pilot board on the 
bridge, and Gabrilov took charge. 
On the screen was a split-image pro- 
jection: one screen showed the view 
from the lifeboat itself, the other the 
picture from the side of the ship as 
the lifeboat curved outwards towards 
the buster. 

Almost a quarter of an hour crept 
by on leaden feet as Gabrilov deli- 
cately maneuvered the tiny lifeboat 
closer and closer to the buster. 
Abruptly a tiny buzzer on the con- 
trol board beeped and kept on beep- 
ing. 



“A hundred miles,” Gabrilov said, 
not looking away from the screen in 
which the buster had grown progres- 
sively from a mere spot of light to 
a sizeable globe. “The homer has 
picked it up. Shall I just let it go its 
own way now?” 

“How far above the surface will 
the magnets take charge?”’ 

“From about ten miles they ought 
to give a soft enough landing for 
the beacon to survive undamaged.” 

“Then try and match velocities 
with the lifeboat about ten miles 
off.” 

Gabrilov raised an eyebrow and 
looked worried, but he moved the 
main jet control slightly. The image 
of the lifeboat in the other half of 
the screen showed a spurt of re- 
action mass. 

More time limped by. 

At last Gabrilov gave a precisely 
timed touch to the braking jet con- 
trol, and sat back. “Very nice,” 
Rusch said under his breath. “Yes, 
she’s going down.” 

Aylward wondered if his heart- 
beats were audible to those around 
him; he was almost deaf with the 
rush of blood in his ears, and he 
was breathing fast and urgently. On 
the screen, the buster grew to moon- 
size, Earth size, and still larger; by 
now the lifeboat and the buster 
could no longer be seen separately 
from the ship without high magni- 
fication. The beeping grew to an 
intolerable unbroken buzz and 
stopped short. 

“Well, she’s down,” Gabrilov said 
unnecessarily. “And it looks as 
though — ” 

He got no further. On both halves 



A BEHER MOUSETRAP 



123 




of the screen there was suddenly an 
eruption of incredible, sun-like light, 
as though a miniature star had been 
born. 

44/^rew’s getting restive, sir,” Gab- 
rilov said, putting back the 
phone. “That was the MO with the 
casualty statement. One man was 
watching through binoculars. He’s 
going to need new eyes when we 
land, and a man in the nav sec- 
tion was looking down a ’scope, and 
he’ll need one new retina. The radar 
tech who first spotted it has gone 
hysterical and needed sedation, and 
we have at least half a dozen cases 
of radiation sickness incipient.” 

Rusch grunted. He had been more 
affected by their narrow escape than 
he wanted to reveal. He said, “It 
seems to me some of us joined the 
service for no better reason than the 
chance of sharing in a buster! The 
thing would have blown us to glory 
if we’d gone much closer. Tell ’em 
they’re lucky to be alive. Did 
the thing leave any debris, by the 
way?” 

“Not a scrap,” said Gabrilov 
gloomily. “Oh, there’s probably some 
dust hell-bent for the stars, but noth- 
ing big enough to pick up.” 

“It can’t have been a total-con- 
version reaction!” The idea seemed 
to hit Rusch like a physical blow. 

*‘Np — or even at this distance, 
we wouldn’t have survived to talk 
about it.” Gabrilov drew himself 
down to a chair and formed his 
body into a posture as though rest- 
ing on the seat. After a moment, 
he said, “Lieutenant Ahmed was 
talking about space-mines. Weapons 



of war. At first I thought he was 
just suffering from the after-effects 
of seeing his dreams of riches go 
bang. But the more I reflect, the 
more I’m inclined to wonder.” 

Rather unwillingly, Rusch looked 
across the room at Aylward. “What 
do you think?” he demanded. 

Aylward shook his head seriously. 
“I don’t think it’s war. I mean — 
well, we haven’t suffered much ma- 
terial damage. It’s cost us thirty or 
so ships, but we have three and a 
half thousand in regular service. The 
loss of experienced space personnel 
is probably more serious, but still 
it’s a fleabite. And besides, why 
should . someone who can afford 
to disguise a mine with thousands of 
tons of metal, and induce a reaction 
as efficient as the one we saw, waste 
effort on sowing a few mines ran- 
domly in space? They could so easily 
make a job of it by launching a few 
into orbits intersecting Earth’s. No, 
I don’t think we have to invoke an 
enemy. My guess is that the busters 
are inherently unstable, being com- 
posed of such heavy elements. Con- 
ceivably they don’t even belong in 
our order of space-time. Alteration 
of the nature of the space around 
them — on the arrival in the vicinity 
of a large and massive object, such 
as a spaceship — might upset their 
not very good equilibrium and blow 
them back into the continuum from 
which they came.” He frowned deep 
ly. “And yet this leaves so many 
questions unanswered. Why, for in- 
stance, were many of them safely 
brought into orbits around human- 
occupied worlds? I had it in the 
back of my mind that they might be 



124 



IF 




contraterrene, but since some of 
them were — uh — hooked, this is 
out of the question. I think I’m go- 
ing to give this matter some further 
investigation.” 

'‘Well, we can’t do much here,” 
Rusch said heavily. "We have sick 
men on board who need planetside 
medical care, but even if we hadn’t 
I’d order immediate planetfall. This 
news about busters is too urgent to 
keep to ourselves. Gabrilov!” 

"Sir?” 

"Get the nav section to program 
us an orbit that will take us in radio 
range of a government station as 
soon as possible, and then home. 
Have the men strap down for a turn- 
ing maneuver. And you’d better 
have the MO issue decelerine, too. 
We’re in a hurry!” 

IV 

M artinu looked regretfully at 
his empty glass, and realized 
as he did so that the gentle voice of 
Professor Aylward had stopped. 
With an effort he brought himself 
back to the present, eyeing the other 
with curiosity. One would never have 
taken him for such a damned good 
story-teller. 

"So that was how it all began,” he 
said after a pause. 

Aylward was tying knots now in 
his length of tubing. He nodded. 
"Mark you,” he said, "it wasn’t easy 
to convince the authorities. I say. 
I’m sorry to have to ask you, but 
would you do me a favor.” 

"Of course.” 

"Well, I’d like another drink, and 
I don’t feel up to fetching one.” 



*‘Oh, certainly!” Martinu pulled 
himself to his feet. His muscles com- 
plained a little, but he adjusted after 
a moment or two and walked off 
with their glasses to find a waiter 
again. He was feeling a little super- 
ior by the time he got back. After 
all, Aylward enjoyed at least some 
gravity most of his life, ^whereas a 
spaceman like himself had to cope 
with the change from no gravity at 
all to one full gee every time he 
landed on Earth. 

Handing Aylward his new drink, 
Martinu wondered whether it was 
genuine devotion to duty or some 
defect of personality which made 
the tubby man hide himself away on 
the far side of the moon. He sus- 
pected the latter, now he came to 
think about it. What a shame — to 
be so outstanding in one narrow 
field, and yet basically incompetent 
in the most important field of all, 
that of being an ordinary person. 

With disconcerting insight Ayl- 
ward said, "There’s no need to be 
sorry for me, you know.” 

Martinu choked on a mouthful of 
his drink and began to make fran- 
tic denials. Aylward ignored him. 
Staring at the dancers inexhaustibly 
whirling around the floor, he went 
on, "I pity you as much as you 
pity me, and both of us ought to 
pity the people here. Like mice, 
when the cat’s away. 

Was he going to become maud- 
lin, for heaven’s sake? Martinu de- 
cided to change the subject as quick- 
ly as possible. He said, "You were 
saying something about convincing 
the authorities, professor.” 

"Was I?” Aylward blinked; the al- 



A BEHER MOUSETRAP 



125 




cohol was taking effect on him. “Ah, 
so I was! Yes, I remember a block- 
headed idiot named Machin — a bu- 
reaucrat if ever there was one — 
who tried to make out that we’d 
concocted a plot to filch all future 
busters away from their rightful 
owners. Like most people, he need- 
ed to have his nose rubbed in the 
truth before he’d accept it. But for 
him, we could have saved the Sir- 
rius/* 

4CT remember the SiriusV* Mar- 
X tinu said. “I had friends on 
her. She found a buster within radio 
range of Luna Port — ” 

“And because of Machin and his 
like,” Aylward interrupted, “it went 
right in to grab it, and was blown up 
with eight hundred people aboard. 
Too many people saw it happen 
with their own eyes, and went blind 
like the crewmen of the Algol, for 
that affair to be hushed up. 

“So they fell over backwards to 
make amends. I was given facilities 
for taking proper equipment to the 
spot when the next buster appeared. 
By the time the fifth or sixth one 
showed up. I’d worked out the theo- 
retical pattern of the Field. They 
try and tell me it was difficult to 
do. but don’t you believe it The 
math is simple enough. What did 
give trouble was getting the generat- 
ing equipment down to portable 
size. But we managed it in the end, 
made it a commercial proposition — 

. nd busters held no more terrors; we 
could stabilize them in our space- 
time long enough to cut them up 
and separate out the radioactives.” 
His s’s were getting the least bit 

i2e 



slurred, and he was staring at his 
fingers as though unsure quite how 
many he could see. 

“Angus tells me,” he went on af- 
ter a pause, “that it might have been 
a very bad thing. It was the direct 
cause of the vast inflation we un- 
derwent — when? — oh, thirteen or 
fourteen years ago, because the mar- 
ket for precious metals was satur- 
ated. It’s the cause of prices like 
five bucks for a cup of coffee and 
two hundred for a taxi ride. I re- 
member I used to dream of having 
a million dollars. Now where would 
it get you? I bet Angus is spending 
a million on this party!” He wave«i 
to include the whole of the gaiety 
around them. Distantly in the back- 
ground a theremin was playing a 
solo in imitation of a trumpet. Mar- 
tinu nodded pontifically. 

“But of course it also cured us of 
the tendency to place arbitrary val- 
ues on things,” Aylward finished. 
“Now we prize only work invested 
as a backing for currency, and the 
uranium from the busters made 
cheap fission-power possible, so may- 
be the trade was a good one. Ah!” 

A waiter in search of empty 
glasses entered the alcove, and Ayl- 
ward signaled to him. “Get the cap- 
tain another!” he instructed. “And 
one of the same for me.” 

Martinu hesitated, then shrugged. 
“Slivovitz,” he told the waiter, who 
nodded and hurried away. A man 
and a girl, holding hands, looked in 
to see if the alcove was unoccupied, 
and on finding it wasn’t moved 
away. The waiter returned with the 
fresh glasses. 

“Foof!” Aylward said, having 

IF 




gulped at his. ‘‘That’s rather good.” 
He lowered the glass cautiously be- 
side him, then leaned back, sleepily 
half-closing his eyes. 

“Look at them,” he said. “Three 
thousand million blind mice. Who’ll 
bell the cat?” 

Martinu, whose own wits were 
apparently slipping a little, said fog- 
gily, “I beg your pardon?” 

“I said. Three thousand million 
blind mice. Who’ll bell the cat?* ” 
repeated Aylward with dignity. 
“Though there isn’t a cat, that I 
know of. For ‘Who’ll bell the cat?’ 
read ‘The mouse ran up the clock’.” 
No, it was no good. Martinu 
didn’t try to follow that one. 

A ylward finished his drink, with 
an appreciative belch, and said, 
“I suppose mice don’t do so badly, 
really. What were we talking 
about?” 

“Mice, apparently,” Martinu said. 
“I was talking about mice,” Ayl- 
ward corrected. “We were talking 
about busters. This can’t last, you 
know.” 

“What can’t last?” 

“All this!” said Aylward largely. 
He gestured. “Not just this party — 
everything else too. All unconscious 
of their doom the little victims play. 
Tell me, do you think the human 
race is master of its fate, or do 
you believe, like some people, that 
we’re property?” 

Martinu was relieved to hear a 
fairly sensible remark for a change. 
He considered the question. “That’s 
one of Fort’s speculations, isn’t it? 
I — well, I don’t know.” 

“I’ll tell you,” Aylward promised. 



“Do you think you’re of value to 
anyone but yourself?” 

“Well, no.” 

“You’re lucky. So am I. Just think 
of all the poor people who think 
they do matter. How disappointed 
they’ll be when they find they don’t!” 

“When will that be?” Martinu 
said, feeling it was expected. 

“Oh, definitely some time. Do 
you know what a buster is? I mean, 
what it’s for?” 

Martinu was finding this a little 
tedious. He wished he had taken 
Angus’s advice. “Tell me,” he re- 
quested resignedly. 

“I warn you, you won’t believe 
me. Angus doesn’t, and he’s a typi- 
cal hard-headed individual. None of 
the other people I’ve told has be- 
lieved me either. Anyway, I’ll tell 
you. You said you didn’t know if we 
were property or not. Well, we 
aren’t property. Because we aren’t 
worth owning. We’re just one hell 
of a nuisance. Did you ever find 
yourself bothered with mice?” 

Sheer politeness, nothing else, 
drove Martinu to bring to bear what 
concentration he had left. “When I 
was a kid,” he said finally, “I recall 
my mother had a house full of them. 
But they never bothered me. I ra- 
ther liked them — except for the 
stink.” 

“How did your mother get rid of 
them?” 

“Well, I guess we tried trapping 
them first. That didn’t work for long 
— the cunning so-and-so’s soon 
learned to avoid the traps. So in the 
end we poisoned them.” 

Another couple appeared at the 
entrance of the alcove, with their 



A BEHER MOUSETRAP 



127 




arms round each other They were 
too absorbed to notice that anyone 
else was present, and walked past 
the seat where Aylward and Mar- 
tinu were towards the curtains hang- 
ing behind it. Glad of some distrac- 
tion, Martinu glanced over his shoul- 
der and saw that they had drawn 
one of the curtains back to reveal 
an open window; they were leaning 
on the sill and staring at the stars. 
He envied them. 

“All right,” Aylward said. “Now if 
you wanted to do something like that 
to men, what would you use for 
baiting your traps?” 

“Pm sorry?” Martinu came back 
with a start. Aylward repeated the 
question. 

“Well,” Martinu said, humoring 
him, “Pd use something either use- 
ful or precious.” 

“Exactly. And you’d lay some 
groundbait first, to lure the unsus- 
pecting victims to the traps when 
they were put down.” 

Suddenly Martinu got it. He won- 
dered why it had taken him so long, 
he said disgustedly. But after a mo- 
ment he saw the amusing side of it 
— and after all, Angus had warned 
him! 

He chuckled. “So they’re mouse- 
traps, and we’re the mice!” he said. 
“>A^at an idea! But aren’t you over- 
looking one thing in your analogy. 
How^about the poison?” 

“I was coming to that,” said Ayl- 
ward with equanimity. “And so, I 



judge, are the ‘people’ who planned 
the busters. When the mice started 
dodging the traps, did your mother 
latch on at once?” 

“No, we kept right on setting 
them for a while. It was only when 
they became a real pest we turned 
to poison.” 

“Pre-cisely!” Aylward looked 
pleased. “I imagine that they — who- 
ever they are — will decide that their 
traps aren’t working any n^ore. Then 
someone will find a super-large, 
stable buster and bring it to Earth, 
and — that will be that.” 

A cold chill moved down Mar- 
tinu’s spine. Trying to ascribe 
it to the open window behind him, 
he said slowly, “Haven’t you heard?” 
“Heard what?” 

“Mohammed Abdul in the Vega 
just brought in the first stable buster 
since the Capella'sl Parked it in or- 
bit today! And — and it’s an out- 
size one, a giant!” 

Alyward’s face, all of a sudden, 
went pasty-pale. He looked at Mar- 
tinu and tried to speak, but couldn’t. 

Behind them, the girl looking out 
the window said in a tone of puzzle- 
ment, “Honey, what’s the time?” 
“Three o’clock. Why?” said her 
companion. 

“I thought it wasn’t dawn yet. 
And that isn’t even the east over 
there. But look how red the sky is 
getting!” END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet... 



Dear Editor: 

I just finished reading the July If, 
and I enjoyed it very much. Might- 
iest Qorn was one of the best Re- 
tief stories IVe read so far. I’m 
looking forward to more in this ser- 
ies. The Faces Outside was very 
good, and so was Down to the 
Worlds of Men, and I hope to see 
more by these two new writers. 

I didn’t intend to start the se- 
rial until I had all the parts, but 
I accidentally got interested in it, 
and now I am eagerly awaiting the 
next issue. I fen joy all the features 
in If, especially the letter column. 
I have two small suggestions. First, 
why not print the approximate date 
the next issue goes on sale? It’d 
make it harder for non-subscribers 
to miss an issue. Second, please 
print the number of installment 
there will be in a new serial so the 
reader know what he’s getting into. 
Outside of these small things, I hope 
If stays exactly the same. Keep 



up the good work on your fine mag- 
azine; it’s one of my favorites. —

• You’ve got a good point about 
printing the number of installments 
a serial will take. We’ll do it. Actual- 
ly we plan to hold all future ser- 
ials to two parts — simply because 
four months is too long to ask you 
to wait! — Editor,

Dear Editor: 

I wish to protest the suggestion of 
Mr. Norwood in the July issue of 
If, that you expand the letter column 
to five pages. A letter column is an 
untrustworthy and usually boring 
beast, which talks for extended per- 
iods on subjects of interest only to 
itself, and in a manner which often 
shows an ignorance of English gram- 
mar. If you must print readers’ let- 
ters, you could at least show the 
editorial discrimination concerning 
them that you show toward your 



HUE AND CRY 



129 




stories, printing only the outstand- 
one, e.g., those of general interest. 
As a rule, an individuars opinions 
of a story are not of general interest 
when they are expressed in general 
terms of approval or disapproval. 
Specific, constructive criticism is 
valuable, but I fear that most let- 
ters are of value only to the editor, 
and should not find their way into 
print. I would suggest, then, that 
the letter column be included in the 
magazine only when you have re- 
ceived enough letters to make it 
worth the space, which would nor- 
mally be used for a story. —

Dear Editor: 

I have a relevant if rather be- 
lated (belated because we always 
get the issues late over here) com- 
ment on You and Nostradamus, A 
bank of organs of the human body 
was predicted, and on a recent news 
bulletin it was announced that such 
a bank was operating here. Speci- 
fically, heart valves of young road 
crash victims were being used to 
replace worn-out organs of elderly 
people. One of the main difficulties 
appeared to be contacting of the 
relatives of the deceased within 48 
hours — after which the organs are 
useless. There was a statement that 
the bank was fast running out of 
supplies (but no mention of tatooing 
willing donors.) 

Another interesting item on the 
same bulletin was that doctors dis- 
cussing quarantine procedures fore- 
saw future difficulties with space 
vehicles and their men 

If has improved greatly in art- 



work, paper and printing recently. 
My main grievance is that there are 
no book reviews, which could easily 
be made room for by cutting out 
one of your shorter shorts, which 
are usually pretty poor. If is cer- 
tainly becoming more readable, and 
you seem to provide fair Space 
Opera — which is in itself a novelty. 
More and better, please! E. E. Smith 
and Heinlein’s serials are good sell- 
ing points, as well as the Retief 
series.—

• Smith? Well, we have a couple 
coming up that will interest you. 
One, by this same E. E. Smith, is 
a little number called Skylark Du- 
Quesne. We don't quite know when 
we'll publish it, because the manu- 
script isn't in yet — but Doc is put- 
ting the finishing touches on it 
right now ! 

And now we're out of room again. 
Our ‘^first" story for this month 
is Long Day in Court by a fellow 
who hides under the pseudonym of 
“Jonathan Brand" and, under his 
real name, occupies a responsible 
position with a large university. 
This is his first fiction anywhere — 
but not his last, because we've al- 
ready bought morel 

Next issue? Philip K. Dick, Ro- 
bert F. Young, a particularly fine 
two-part serial beginning by Poul 
Anderson — yes, it's a good one. And 
we have a problem in semantics 
concerning it for you to chew over: 
The next issue of If contains two 
Poul Anderson stories, but only one 
of them is by Poul Anderson. 

How come? Well, come around 
next issue and see! — Editor.
