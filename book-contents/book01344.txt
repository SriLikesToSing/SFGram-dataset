TOMORROWS TO ORDER 

# 



I f you read our fiister mai^azine, 
Galaxy, and in paiiscolar if 
you’ve read the June issue, you al- 
ready know everything we’re going 
to say in these two pages and so you 
can get right on with the stories, 
Hue & Cry, etc. 

If not — well, first take a look 
at the full-page ^vertisements that 
oocnament this sectkm. 

You will find that two of them 
are tmusual in that they are pre- 
pared and paid for by the science- 
fiction writers themselves. They 
place the body of science-fiction 
writers squarely on record on the 
question of Vietnam. (Only trouble 
is that there are about as many in 
favor of picldng up our marbles and 
leaving as there in favor of banging 
on, no matter what.) 

The third is also unusual hi that 
it is an appeal to you to do some- 



thing about the problem suggested 
by the other two; That is, we are 
trying to get the highly intelligent, 
sophisticate alert and well informed 
science-fiction community (at least, 
that’s the way we always describe 
ourselves, isn't it?) to turn away 
from taking ponitions on the Viet- 
namese problem, and begin the much 
more demanding task of trying to 
solve it. 

I s this a reasonable hope? Is there 
any chance at all that we science- 
fiction types, readers and writers 
alike, will be able to contribute any- 
thing very useful to a problem that 
has nearly destroyed one country 
and caus^ enormous physical or 
social damage to two others? — 
bearing in mind that every politician, 
columnist and Big Thinker on five 
continents has already had his own 



6 





What Would YOU 
Do About Vietnam? 

Assume you are being asked for advice. Assume the people who 
ask you are the President of the United States, the Congress, the 
State Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff — anyone and/or 
everyone who has any decision-making authority concerning Ameri- 
can involvement in Vietnam. Assume they want one suggestion 
from you . and assume they will follow it. 

What would you tell them to do? 

Don't tell them. Tell us. We will take the most provocative and 
seemingly productive suggestions received, submit them to problem- 
solving analysis, and present the results in a forthcoming issue 
of Galaxy. 

The Rules 

1. Anyone is eligible to enter, and may submit as many entries as he 
likes. Each entry must be on a separate sheet of paper, one side only, 
and Include your name and address. All entries will b^ome the property 
of Galaxy Publishing Corporation. Please limit yourself to a maximum 
of 100 words for each entry, preferably In the form of (a) your suggestion, 

(b) followed, if you wish, by a statement of why you think it worth doing. 

2. Suggestions may be on any areo of American involvement In Vietnam 
— ways of winning the war, ways of bringing about a peaceful settlement, 
whatever you think would be of value. 

3. Five prizes of $100 each will be awarded to those entries which, 
in the opinion of the fudges, best deserve them. In the event of duplicate 
suggestions, the first entries received will get the prize. Judges will con- 
sist of, or be appointed by, the Editors of Galaxy Publishing Corporation. 
Winners will be notified by mall, and their names will be published tn a 
forthcoming Issue of this magazine. 

4. Send your entries toi "What Would You Do About Vietnam?", 
Galaxy Publishing Corporation, 421 Hudson Street, New York, N.Y. 10014. 
Entries must be received by July 4th, 1968, to be eligible for prizes. 



say on what everyone concerned 
ought to do next? 

The way we look at it, if there is 
no such chance it's up to us to invent 
one. Certainly the world's leaders 
have accomplished very little. 

And maybe — just maybe, to be 
sure — we of the free imaginations 
and untrammeled creative instincts 
may be able to find some new paths 
to walk that might ultimately lead 
us out of the manmade jungle that 
is threatening to wreck our society 
faster than technology can put it 
together again. 

At any rate, we think it’s worth 
a try. 

So play the game with us, please. 
Put yourself in the position of the 
President of the Unil^ States, the 
Senate, the Combined Chiefs of 
Staff — of any power figure or 
group that you think can do any- 
thing constructive about either win- 
ning the war, or fmding a way to 
stop it, or substituting some other 
medhanism for the pointless slaught- 
er and despoilation that is apparent- 
ly our present method of choice. 

How you solve it all, of course, 
is up to you. If we had the solutions 
we clearly wouldn^t need the contest. 
But it seems apparent that there 
are some panameterB. A military 
solution would only be acceptable if 
it carried with it some failnsafe 
measure that would safegruard us 
against reprisal from China or the 
U.S.S.R. An injunction for the South 



Vietnamese to take over more of 
the fighting and carry out its pro- 
grams of pacification, cleaning up 
corruption and so on is no good un- 
less you can tell us how to make 
these measures feasible. And so on. 

But don't, on the other hand, bo 
deterred from making a good, spe- 
cific suggestion merely because it 
would be hard to put into practice. 
Because that's Step Two in our 
program. 

Y ou see, once we get a sizeable 
number of interesting ideas we 
plan to submit them all to the judg- 
ments of as competent a pan^ of 
experts as we can obtain. The panel 
will be asked to evaluate them in 
terms of desirability, feasibility and 
effectiveness . and to suggest 
ways of improving them in all those 
terms. 

If you've beeo. reading If and 
Galaxy for very long it will be no 
surprise to you that we think so- 
ciety's only hope of solving the 
problems our technology has created 
for us lies in employing technology's 
own problem-solving techniques on 
them. And that's what we are plan- 
ning to do. .The results, whatever 
they may be, will be reported in 
these magazines as they happen. 
Will it all work? 

We don't know. We can offer 
hopes, but no (giiarantees. But does 
anyone have any better ideas?

STAR 



by FREDERIK POHL and JACK WILLIAMSON 





nUistroied by 



In a universe where stars and men 
were Joined as brothers, something 
new — and dangerous! — was born 



I that would whisk him across the in- 

terstellar gulfs between star and star, 

H is name was Andreas Quamodi- he looked out of place. He didn’t 
an, short, stout, self-important, look like the sort of man who would 
Waiting his turn to enter the lu- be engaged in business important 
minous iris of the transflex cube, enou^ to justify the use of the 



transflex cube. But he didn’t look 
like the sort of man on whom the 
lives of countless billions of beings 
might depend; and» curiously, he was 
both those things. 

The control dome flashed a signal 
to him as he entered the ramp. 
“Identification, sir?” 

“Ridiculous,” muttered Andy Qua- 
modian. “Silly red tapel” But he let 
his flyer hover while he sorted out 
the documents of his interstellar 
citizenship. The dome extended a 
long, nimble finger of pale plasma 
to scan his passport. 

The passport bore his ident num- 
ber, an endless row of binary digits. 
Below it another line translated the 
numbers into the universal language: 

Name: Andreas Quamodian. 

Race: Human. 

Birthplace: New Europe, Planet 5, 
Star 4894, Sector B-311-C, Galaxy 
1 . 

Organization: Companions of the 
Star. 

Status: Monitor. 

Priority: — 

But the last line was blank. “Hur- 
ry up, will you?” Quamodian bark- 
ed. “Can’t you see Fm in a hurry?” 

. The tendril of plasma turned the 
passport disk about, catching in it a 
reflection of his dark, round face. 
“Destination, sir?” the control dome 
inquired. 

“Earth. That’s — confound it, let 
me see — yes, that’s Planet 3, Star 
7718, Sector Z-989-Q, Galaxy 5. 
Route me through the Wisdom Creek 
station. Octant 5.” 

The plasma tendril winked out. 
Quamodian caught the passport disk 
as it dropped and stowed it away, 

12 



then resumed his inching crawl to- 
ward the cube. A long silver tank, no 
doubt filled with a liquid citizen, was 
vanishing through the closing gate. 
Behind it a multiple creature followed 
a horde of small, bright, black things, 
hopping and tumbling inside a com- 
munal cloud of luminous blue mist 
A gray-scaled dragon shuffled just 
ahead of Quamodian, burdened with 
a bright metal turret on its back that 
probably housed unseen symbiotes. 
Winking crystal ports in the turret 
peeked at Quamodian. 

As Quamodian inched after the 
dragon a flashing signal halted him. 
“Sir,” said the control dome, “we 
have no record of your priority for 
this trip.” 

great stars,” cried Quamo- 
dian, “can’t you see I’m in a 
hurry?” But grumbling, he held up 
a scrap of yellow transfac film for 
the plasma sensor to scan. The plas- 
ma hesitated and recoiled. 

“Sir, that document is not in the 
universal language,” 

“Of course not!” Quamodian 
snapped. “It’s in English. Read it!” 
“I have no equivalence data for 
‘English,’ sir.” 

“Well, then I’ll translate it. It’s 
transmitted from Earth — that’s the 
mother planet of my race, you know. 
The sender is a girl — I mean, a 
youthful female human creature — 
named Molly Zaldivar. Her message 
is addressed to me. It is of great im- 
portance, and — ” 

“Sir.” Ahead the multiple creature 
had already disappeared into the 
transflex cube and the dragon was 
lumbering forward. “You are delay- 

IF 




< mg transshipment 1 ask for your pri- 
ority authorization now/’ 

‘Tm giving it to you! Listen to 
what she says: *Dear Andy, please 
forgive me for leaving you so rudely. 
If you can, come to Earth at once. 
The local Companions have never 
heard of rogue stars; they won’t pay 
any attention to my warnings. But — 
Andy, dear Andy, I’m frightened! 
Rogue men are in contact with 
rogue stars right now, and I have no 
hope but you!’” 

“Sir, that is not an acceptable pri- 
ority. Please leave the ramp!” 
“Confound you,” shouted Quamo- 
dian, “don’t you understand? That’s 
priority enough for anything! That’s 
a threat to the whole human race!” 
“Sir. The human race is identified 
in my files as an insignificant little 
breed of barbarians, just recently ad- 
mitted to provisional citizenship. No 
human being is authorized to issue a 
priority for interstellar travel,” 

“But they may be in grave danger 
of — ” 

“Sir, please leave the ramp. You 
may apply through official channels 
for authorization for your trip.” 
“There’s no time! The danger is 
urgent!” The dome did not reply, 
but ominously the plasma tendi^ 
thickened and began to spread. 
^‘Wait!” Quamodian cried desperate- 
ly. “I’m a member of the order of 
Companions of the Star! Surely you 
know of them. Our mission is to pro- 
tect humanity, and other races, too.” 
“My indices do not show any au- 
thorization issued to you for this 
journey by the Companions of the 
Star, sir. You are holding up traffic. 
Please move off the ramp.” 

ROGUE STAR 



Quamodian glanced bleakly at the 
citizen crowding behind him: Forty 
tons of sentient mineral, granite* 
hard, jagged and black, afloat on its 
own invisible transflection field and 
impatiently extending its own pass- 
port at the tip of a blue finger of 
plasma. “Don’t shove. Citizen!” he 
barked. ‘There’s been a misunder- 
standing. Listen, Control. Check your 
records. We humans are allied to the 
multiple citizen named Cygnus, which 
is a symbiotic association of fusori- 
ans, stars and men. Its chief star is 
Almalik...or don’t you care about 
sentient stars any more than you do 
about men?” 

His irony was wasted on the dome. 
“Get out of line,” its signal flashed 
imperatively. Then, a split-second 
later. “You may wait on the side of 
the ramp. The multiple citizen Cyg- 
nus is listed on our indices. We will 
call the star Almallk, in Galaxy 5. 

D isgruntled, Quamodian switched 
his flyer out of line, giving up 
his place to the granite citizen, who 
passed him with an air of disdain. He 
hovered impatiently at the edge of 
the ramp, watching the gate ahead 
expand again as it swallowed the 
gray-scaled dragon and its turret of 
symbiotic fellows. 

For a moment Quamodian thought 
of making a mad dash for the iris 
aperture, but there was no sense in 
that. However fast his flyer moved, 
the dome would be faster; and then 
he would be even longer delayed fti 
getting to Earth. 

He snatched a light-pen and scrib- 
bled hastily on his message panel: 
“Molly, I’m having a little trouble. 

13 




But I’m coming, as fast as I can.” 
He added the routing information 
and watched the hungry tongue of 
plasma lick away the photons in the 
message, storing them as spin-vari- 
ances in an electron cloud. He knew 
that his invisible package of tagged 
electrons was already enroute for the 
transflex fields around the cube, auto- 
matically seeking out the fastest 
route though the shifting sub-uni- 
verses of transflection to home in on 
Molly’s distribution point. 

With any luck, he would follow 
at the same speed, arriving almost 
as fast as the message. But if his luck 
was low ... if the monitor dome 
would not permit him to pass . 

Quamodian shuddered and stared 
blankly out at the horde of beings 
slowly moving past him on the ramp. 

He shook himself. “Divert me,” 
he said harshly. 

At once a more than humanly so- 
prano voice began to sing from some- 
where inside his flyer: “5/, m/, chi- 
amano Mimi . .” 

“No. Not opera.” 

The voice fell silent. A holograph 
of a chessboard appeared on the 
communications panel, the pieces set 
up for a game; White’s King’s 
Pawns slid forward two spaces and 
waited for his reply. 

“I don’t want to play chess, either. 
Wait a minute. Set up a probability 
matrix for me. Estimate the chances 
of the star Almalik granting me a 
priority.” 

.“With running analysis, or just 
the predicted expectancy, Mr. Qua- 
modian?” asked the voice of the 
flyer. 

With analysis. Keep me amused.” 



“Well, sirl By gosh, there’s a lot 
of stuff you got to consider, like — ” 

“Without the comedy ^alect,” 

“Certainly, Mr. Quamodian. These 
are the major factors. Importance 
of human race in universal civiliza- 
tion: low. Approximately point-five 
trillion humans, scattered on more 
than a hundred stellar systems in 
three galaxies; but these represent 
only about one one-hundreth of one 
per cent of the total population of 
universal civilization, even counting 
multiple and group intellects as sin- 
gles. Concern of star Almalik with 
individual human Andreas Quamodi- 
an, negligible.” 

What about the concern of Alma- 
lik for the Companions of the Star?” 
cried Quamodian angrily. 

“Coming to that, Mr. Quamodian. 
Concern rated as well under noise 
level on a shared-time basis, but in- 
serting the real-time factor makes it 
low but appreciable. So the critical 
quantity in the equation is the rele- 
vance of the term ‘rogue star.’ I 
have no way of estimating the star 
Almalik’s reaction to that, Mr. Qua- 
modian.” 

“The rogue stars are the most im- 
portant phenomena in the universe,” 
said Quamodian, staring out at the 
ramp. 

“In that case — hum — allow- 
ing for pressure of other affairs; you 
haven’t kept up with the news, but 
there have been some unpleasant 
events on Earth — let’s see, I give 
it point seven probability, Mr. Qua- 
modian. One hundred fourteen vari- 
ables have been considered. They are 
respectively — ” 

“Don’t bother.” 



14 



IF 




no bother, Mr. Quamodian,” 
said the machine, a little sulkily. 
They were all moody, these compan- 
ionship-oriented ship’s contrcd mech- 
anisms; it was the price you had to 
pay for free conversation. Quamodian 
said soothingly: 

“You’ve done well. It’s just that 
I’m upset over the danger represented 
by the rogue star.” 

“I can understand that, Mr. Qua- 
modian,” said the machine warmly, 
responding at once. “A threat to 
one’s entire race — ” 

“1 don’t give a hoot about the 
human racel” 

“Why Mr. Quamodian! Then 
what — ” 

“It’s Molly Zaldivar I care about. 
Make a note of this, you hear? Never 
fOTget it: The welfare of Molly 
Zaldivar is the most important thing 
in the universe to me, b^use 1 love 
her with all my heart In spite of — 

Quamodian thought bleakly of 
Molly Zaldivar, and Cliff Hawk, 
and the day years before when she 
had told him that it was Hawk she 
loved. 

“In spite of everything,” he fin- 
ished. “Now shut up. The monitor’s 
signalling — I guess my priority was 
approved!”

dian to know why he loved her: the 



laughter in her voice, even when ihe 
sang the saddest ballads of the cdd 
moth er world; the skin tones that 
changed from wannest ivory to 
tawny gold under the queer shifting 
light of the triple star in the uni- 
versity’s sides. But — half the stu- 
dents did not “hear,” at least on the 
audio frequency range used by hu- 
man beings; many of them did not 
see with “visible” light. Yet all were 
fond of Molly Zaldivar. 

There were only three hundred 
humans in the school. Andy Qua- 
modian, already serious, a little pud- 
gy, dark and slow. Molly Zaldivar, 
like a golden flame, her bright hair 
catching ruddy glints from the red 
giant star above them, her dark eyes 
flashing the violet light of the dwarf. 
And — Cliff Hawk. 

Even after nine years, Andreas 
Quamodian still scowled at the 
thought of Cliff Hawk. He was a 
rogue in the society of men, a rogue 
in the university, brooding, angry. 
Tall, gaunt, restless, he had shaggy 
black hair and burning blue eyes. 
Where Molly and Quamodian had 
come from old Earth itself, sent to 
the university on linguistic fellow- 
ships to learn the myriad communi- 
cations-forms of the galaxies, Cliff 
Hawk was a technician. His ancestors 
had roamed the Reefs of Space, fugi- 
tives from the old interplanetary em- 
pire called the Plan of Man. Their 
prideful blood still burned in his 
veins. He loved Molly Zaldivar — 
carelessly and roughly, with a cer- 
tainty that she would sacrifice her 
own career for any of his whims. 
Whereas Andy Quamodian only wor- 
shipped her.

When it came time for Molly Zal- 
divar to choose, she really had not 
had a choice. Andy Quamodian 
could see that now — what choice 
between plodding little Andy Quam 
and the dark, dangerous man from 
the borderland of space? 

But he had not seen it at the time; 
and the moment when Molly Zaldi- 
var sent him away still burned, nine 
years later . , . 

44^^^ou are not paying attention, 
Mr. Quamodian,” the flyer 
reprimanded him. ”The control dome 
is signalling.” 

“What? — Oh, sorry.” Quamodian 
gave orders, and the flyer swam back 
into the stream of traffic. A stalked 
horror of a citizen with members 
like bamboo shoots and a frond of 
brain tissue like a skirt around its 
waist had paused, was waiting for 
him to precede it into the transflex 
tube. 

“Your attention, sir!” flashed the 
control dome. “The multiple citizen 
Cy^us is fully qualified to issue pri- 
orities for intergalactic travel. Alma- 
lik, spokesman star for the citizen, 
has granted you priority for immedi- 
tae transit to Earth. You may enter 
the transflex cube.” 

“Thanks,” grumbled Quamodian, 
and guided his flyer into the luminous 
cavern of the cube. 

A veteran of a good many inter- 
galactic transits, Quamodian had nev- 
er learned to enjoy them. The effects 
of transflection varied with the in- 
dividual. Some felt nothing; a few 
reported pleasure or exhilaration. 
Most, to whom transit was unpleas- 
ant or terrifying, resorted to sleep 



drugs or hypnosis to make the ex- 
perience pass quickly. Quamodian 
merely endured it. 

He watched the dark diaphragm 
contract behind him and at once 
felt the flyer seem to pitch and veer. 
Rotated out of space and time, rout- 
ed by computation through the con- 
gruent folds of a dozen or a hun- 
dred parallel universes, he felt as he 
always did: lost, and stunned, and 
queasy. 

The blue walls flickered and dis- 
solved into a darkening, grayish haze. 
A queer roaring came hollowly from 
nowhere, swelling in his ears. Numb- 
ing cold drove through him, as if 
every tissue of his body had some- 
how been plunged into the dark zero 
of the space between galaxies . 

But then the careening flyer stead- 
ied. “Prepare to emerge, Mr. Qua- 
modian,” it sang in his ear, and the 
roaring storm of sound and sensa- 
tion died away. 

The shining walls were real again. 
But now they were greenish-gray 
instead of blue, and painted in bold 
black characters with the identifying 
characters of the Wisdom Creek Sta- 
tion on Earth. Ahead of him the 
exit gate expanded. 

There was no traffic here, no 
waiting line of citizens enduring the 
delays that beset their important 
business, no bustle of intergalactic 
civilizations. It was quiet and pas- 
toral, 

Andy Quamodian leaned forward 
as the flyer glided out of the cube 
and looked for the first time in his 
adult life on the warm, broad acres 
that were lit by the single sun of 
Earth.

IF 




minutes later the charm 
•Li- and the nostalgia were gone, 
and Quamodian was snapping furi- 
ously at his flyer. “What do you 
mean, you can’t reach Miss Zaldi- 
var? I just sent her a message ...” 
“Your message has not been de- 
livered, Mr. Quamodian. Her com- 
munications circuits have been block- 
ed; she wishes to accept no calls.” 
“Nonsensel And the local office of 
the Companions of the Star ...” 
“Also blocked, Mr. Quamodian. A 
local custom. I have been assured 
that in fourteen hours, local time, 
they will be at your service, but until 
then — ” 

“Don’t be a fool I” Quamodian 
shouted. “I can’t wait that long! Here, 
I’ll go to the office myself!” 

“Certainly, Mr. Quamodian.” The 
flyer began to settle toward a dusty 
plaza m front of the transflex tower. 
“Of course,” it added apologetically, 
“you will have to go on foot. By lo- 
cal custom, flyers are not permitted 
to operate more than one hundred 
meters from the transflex center at 
this time.” 

“Great Almalik! Oh, very well.” 
Fussily Quamodian collected himself 
and stamped out of the opening door. 
“Which way?” 

A voice by his ear answered, as 
the flyer activated its external speak- 
ers: “Down this street, Mr. Quamo- 
dian. The gold building with the en- 
sign of the Companions.” 

He turned and stared. Behind him, 
the flyer quietly rose, drifted back 
to the tall, tapered, black transflex 
tower and settled to wait at its base. 
Quamodian was alone on the planet 
of his birth. 



He was 4^e resized, more alone 
than he had expected. He knew that 
parts of Earth were stiB scarcely 
ulated — nothing like the teeming 
metrapolises of the hub-worlds of 
the universe, nothing like ev^ the 
relatively minor planets of his uni- 
versity training and recent practical 
experience. 

But he had not expected Earth, 
even this part of Earth, to be empty. 

Yet there was not a soul in si^t 
He peered back toward the trans- 
flex tower: his waiting flyer, mo- 
tionless and peaceful; noting else. 
He looked down a long artificial- 
stone boulevard: a school building a 
hospital, a few supply centers . 
and no one in sight. He saw a park 
with benches and a playground, but 
no one was near any of them; saw 
parked* vehicles, seemingly aban- 
doned, a library without readers, a 
fountain with no one to watch its 
play. 

“Ridiculous,” he grumbled, and 
walked toward the building that 
glinted in the sun. 

Earth’s single star was hot, and 
the full gravity of his home planet 
was more than Andreas Quamodian 
had been used to for a good many 
years. It was a tiring walk. But there 
was something pleasant about it, 
about the dusty smell of the hot 
pavement and the luminous young, 
green leaves of the trees that over- 
hung the walk. Peace lay over the 
village, like a benediction of Almalik. 

But Quamodian had not come to 
Earth in search of peace. He in- 
creased his stride, and chugged up 
the walkway, beside the flagpole that 
bore the standard of the Compan- 



ROGUE STAR

ions of the Star: the thirteen colored 
stars of Alofialifc in the dotted ellipses 
of their intricate orbits, against a 
black field of space. 

T he door did not open for him. 

Quamodian nearly ran into it; 
he only stopped just in time. 

“What the devil’s the matter here?” 
he demanded, more surprised than 
angry — at least at first. “I am 
Andreas Quamodian, a monitor of 
the Companions of the Star. Admit 
me at once!” 

But the bright crystal panel did not 
move. “Good morning. Citizen Qua- 
modian,” said a recorded robot- 
voice. “The Wisdom Creek post of 
the Companions of the Star is closed 
today, in observance of local religious 
custom. It will be open as usual on 
Monday.” 

“I’ll report this!” Quamodian 
cried. “Mark my words! I’ll call the 
Regional Office of the Companions 
of the Star — ” 

“A public communications instru- 
ment is just to your left. Citizen 
Quamodian,” the robot-voice said 
politely. “It is cleared for emergency 
use even on Starday.” 

“Emergency, eh? You bet it’s an 
emergency!” But Quamodian had had 
enough of arguing with recorded 
voices. He stalked along the flank of 
the gold-colored ceramic building to 
the communications booth, angrily 
dialed the code for the Regional Of- 
fice . • • and found himself talking to 
another recorded voice. 

‘"Companions of the Star, Third 
Octant Office,” it said briskly. 

“Oh, confound — Never mind. 
Listen. 1 am Monitor Quamodian. 



I am in Wisdom Credr to investigate 
a reported emergency, and 1 find the 
local office closed. This lax opera- 
tion is highly irregular! I demand the 
office be opened and — ” 

“Monitor Quamodian,” reproved 
the robot voice, ‘"this is impossible. 
Under our revised covenant with the 
Visitants, no local posts operate on 
Stardays so that local personnel may 
be free to engage in voluntary reli- 
gious activities. Even Regional Offices 
are machine-operated during this — 
‘"But this is an emergency! Can’t 
you understand?” 

""Monitor Quamodian, my sensors 
detect no emergency situation in 
Wisdom Creek.” 

"‘That’s what I’m here for! I — 
well, I don’t know the exact nature 
of the emergency, but I require im- 
mediate assistance — ” 

‘"Our Wisdom Creek post will 
open promptly at midnight, local 
time,” the voice informed him bland- 
ly. "‘Competent assistance will bo 
available then.” 

“Midni^t will be too — ” 

But the line clicked, buzzed and 
settled to a steady hum. 

Muttering with anger, Quamodian 
tried Molly Zaldivar’s code. But his 
flyer had been right; there was no 
answer. 

Puffing with irritation as much as 
fatigue, Quamodian lowered himself 
to the steps of the office of the Com- 
panions and scowled at the empty 
street. How many hundreds of thou- 
sands of light-years had he spanned 
to be here, on this day, in this back 
wash of life? What tremendous forces 
had he enlisted to hurl him across the 
gulfs of space, to race against the

dreadful fears that Molly Zaldivar’s 
message had conjured up 
He licked' dry lips and wiped per- 
spiration from his brow. He was a 
hero, ready to rescue maiden, towns- 
people, world itself. But none of 
them appeared to want to be rescued. 

Ill 

T wenty-five miles southwest of 
Wisdom Creek, Molly Zaldivar 
did want to be rescued. At that mo- 
ment she wanted it very badly. 

Her old blue electric car had 
whined up the rocky mountain road, 
three thousand feet above the plain; 
below her she saw the flat, dry 
valley with the little town of Wisdom 
Creek huddled around the twin spires 
of the Transflex tower and the 
church. But now the road went no 
farther. It dipped, circled a spur of 
the mountainside, and went tumbling 
into the other valley beyond. From 
here on she would have to walk . 
But that she could not do. 

Above her she heard the restless, 
singing rustle of the creature Cliff 
Hawk called a sleeth. She could not 
see it. But she could imagine it there, 
tall as a horse but far more massive, 
black as space and sleek as her own 
hair. And she knew that at that mo- 
ment she was closer to death than 
she had ever been before. 

She tiptoed silently back to the 
car, 'eyes on the rocks over her head. 
The singing sound of the creature 
faded away and returned, faded away 
and came back again. Perhaps it had 
not detected her. But it might at any 
moment, and then — 

Molly entered the car and closed 



the door ' gently, not latching it. 
Breathing heavily — partly from 
nerves, partly from the thin, higjh air 
around her — she picked up her com- 
municator and whispered, “Cliff? 
Will you answer me. Cliff, please?” 
There was no sound except for the 
faint sound of the sleeth, and the 
even fainter whisper of wind around 
the mountaintop. 

Molly bit her lip and glanced over 
her shoulder. She dared not start the 
car’s motor. It was not very loud, but 
the sleeth was far too close; it was 
a wonder it hadn’t heard her coming 
up the trail. But the road sloped 
sharply away behind her. If she re- 
leased the brakes the old car would 
roll on its out-of-date wheels; it would 
rattle and creak, but not at low 
speeds, much. Not at first. And Cliff 
had told her that the sleeth would 
not wander more than a few hundred 
yards from the cavemouth. She was 
very close now, but the car would 
roll out of range in not much more 
than a minute. • 

But then what? Cliff did not an- 
swer. She had to see him — had to 
stop whatever he was doing, teamed 
with the rude, hard man who owned 
the sleeth. She would never be any 
closer than this, and what hope was 
there that the sleeth would be else- 
where if she tried again another time 
anyway? 

“bh, please, Cliff,” she whispered 
to the communicator, “it’s Molly and 
I’ve got to talk to you. ...” 

T here was a rattle of pebbles and 
dust, and Molly craned her neck 
to look upward in sudden terror. 
There was the sleeth, eyes huge as 



ROGUE STAR 



19 




a man’s head, green as the light from 
a radium-dial watch. It was perched 
over her, the bright, broad eyes star- 
ing blindly across the valley. It was 
graceful as a cat, but queerly awk- 
ward as it floated in its transflection 
field, clutching at the rubble with 
claws that were meant for killing. 

It did not seem to have seen her. 
Yet. 

Molly froze, her ears tuned to the 
singing rustle of the sleeth. Its huge 
muscles worked supply under the 
fine-scaled skin, and the eyes slowly 
turned from horizon to horiaon. 
Then it drifted idly back behind the 
rock, and Molly dared to breathe 
again. “Oh, Cliff,” she whispered, 
but only to herself. She could not 
bring herself to speak even in an un- 
dertone to the communicator. 

But even terror fades; the monkey- 
mind of a human being will not stay 
attuned even to the imminent threat 
of death. Molly became aware of her 
cramped position on the scarred plas- 
tic seat of the car, cautiously straight- 
ened her legs and sat up. 

If only Cliff Hawk would hear her 
message and come. 

If only the sleeth would drift over 
to the other side of the mountain, 
give her a chance to make a mad 
dash for the cavemouth and the men 
inside. 

If only — she was stretching for 
impossibles now, she knew — if only 
poor Andy Quam would respond to 
her plea for help and come charging 
out of the transflex tower with weap- 
ons and wisdom and the strength 
to do whatever had to be done to stop 
Cliff from going through with this 
dreadful work. ... 



But they were all equally impossi- 
ble. Cliff couldn’t hear her, the 
sleeth wouldn’t go away. And as for 
Andy Quam — 

Even in her fear she couldn’t help 
smiling. Poor old Andy, sober and 
serious, loving and stuffy, full of 
small rages and great kindnesses . 
of all the rescuing heroes a girl 
might imagine, surely he was the most 
unlikely. 

The singing sound of the sleeth 
grew louder again, and fearfully she 
looked upward. But it did not appear. 

Even the Reefer would be welcome 
now, she thought — that gaunt yel- 
low-bearded giant who was Cliff 
Hawk’s ally in his folly. She was 
afraid of the Reefer. He seemed like 
a throwback to a monstrous age of 
rage and rapine, a Vandal plunder- 
ing a peaceful town, a Mau-Mau 
massacring sleeping children. He had 
always been polite enough to her, 
of course, but there was something 
about him that threatened devasta- 
tion. Not that any additional threats 
were necessary. What Cliff was doing 
was bad enough in itself! Creating 
sentient life at the atomic level — try- 
ing to breed living, thinking tissue of 
the same stuff that was at the core of 
the sapient stars themselves. And 
worst of all, trying to duplicate in the 
laboratory the kind of life that made 
some stars rogues, pitted them against 
their fellows in a giant struggle of 
hurled energies and destroying bolts 
of matter. 

She grinned suddenly, thinking 
again of Andy Quam: imagine pitting 
him against the Reefer! Why, he. 

Molly Zaldivar sat bolt upright. 

She had just realized that the sing- 

IF 



20 




ing sound of the sleeth was gone. 
The only noise on the mountain was 
the distant, moaning wind. 

She waited for a long moment, 
gathering her courage, then slipped 
quietly from the seat. She stood be* 
side it, ready to leap back inside and 
flee, however useless that would be 
... but the sleeth was still out of 
range. 

Carefully, quietly she took a step 
up the rock path, and another. A 
pebble spun and grated under her 
feet. She paused, heart pounding — 
but there was no response. 

Another step . • • and another. • 

She was at the top of the path 
now. To her right the cavemouth 
waited, rimmed with crystal, a rubble 
of junked laboratory equipment in 
front of it. No one was in sight. 
Not even — especially not — the 
sleeth. 

Molly broke into a trot and hur- 
ried toward the cavemouth. 

At that moment the sleeth appear- 
ed, rocketing over the crest of the 
mountain, coming down directly to- 
ward her like a thrown spear. She 
could see its great blind eyes staring 
directly into hers; it was moving at 
sonic velocities, hundreds of miles an 
hour; it would be on her in a second. 
**Cliffr she shrieked, and flung her- 
self toward the cavemouth. 

She never reached it. 

From inside the cave a great puff 
of black smoke came hurtling out in 
a perfect vortex ring. The concussion 
caught her and lifted her off her 
feet, threw her bruisingly to the 
ground. The sound followed a mo- 
ment later and was deafening, but by 
then Molly was past caring; explo- 



sion, painful skin lacerations, raging 
sleeth, all blended together in a slow 
fading sensation, and she was un- 
conscious. 

W hat was real and what was 
dream? Molly opened her eyes 
dizzily and saw the gaunt bleeding 
face of Cliff Hawk staring down at 
her, aghast. She closed them again, 
and someone — someone, something, 
some voice — was calling to her, 
and she saw Someone trapped and 
raging, commanding her to come . 
“Wake up! Confound you, Molly!’’ 
“I’m awake, dearest,” she said, 
and opened her eyes. It was Cliff. 
‘We’ve got to get him out of there,” 
she said earnestly. “He’s lost and trap- 
ped — ” 

“Who? What are you talking 
about?” 

She caught her head in her hands, 
suddenly aware of how much it hurt. 
“Why — ” She looked up at Cliff 
Hawk, puzzled. “I forget.” 

He grimaced. “You’re confused,” 
he announced. “And a pest, besides. 
What are you doing here?” 

“I wanted to stop you,” she said 
dizzily. She was trying to remember 
what the very important thing was 
that Someone had said to her in her 
dream. If it had been a dream. 

“Thought so. And look what you’ve 
done! As if I didn’t have enough 
trouble.” 

Molly abandoned the fugitive 
memory. “There was an explosion,” 
she said. “I got hurt.” 

Cliff Hawk looked suddenly less 
angry, more worried. Clearly Molly 
was telling him nothing he didn’t al- 
ready know. The rivulet of blood

that ran down from a scrape on his 
forehead divided around his nose, 
blurred itself in the blue stubble of 
beard on his cheeks and chin. It made 
him look like a dangerous clown. 
But a clown with some great fear 
riding his back. 

“We — we had an accident. 
Molly, go back to Wisdom Creek.” 
She shook her head and then, 
without preamble, began to cry. 

. Hawk swore violently, but his 
touch was gentle as he reaped swift- 
ly down, caught her shoulders, help- 
ed her to her feet and into the cave. 
Molly let herself weep without shame, 
but it did not keep her from seeing 
that the cave was in fact a work- 
shop, lined with glittering metal, rich 
with instruments and machines. A 
corona of pale violet hung over a 
humming golden globe, now soiled 
and dented from whatever it was 
that had exploded nearby. She heard 
the distant howl of a power tube, 
screaming to itself like the bass-C 
of a steam calliope as it sucked energy 
from the air. She let him find her a 
seat on a wobbly laboratory stool, 
accepted a tissue and dabbed at her 
nose. 

“You’ve got to go back,” Cliff 
Hawk told her with rough tender- 
ness. “I’m busy.” 

“You’re in trouble!” she corrected. 
“It’s dangerous, Cliff. Leave the 
rogue stars alone! I’ll go back to 
Wisdom Creek if you come with me.” 
“I can’t. We’ve had this out be- 
fore.” 

“But you’re risking your life — ■ 
the whole world — ” 

“Molly.” Awkwardly he touched 
her shoulder. “I can’t stop. Even if it 



costs me my life. £v^ if it destroys 
the world. Did you mean it wh^ 
you said you loved me? Then go back 
and leave me alone.” 

IV 

A ndy Quam puffed around the cor- 
ner and shouted: “Say, there! 
Wait a minute, will you?” 

The three boys he had spied were 
ambling down the dusty road, yards 
away. They paused and looked 
around at him, politely curious. 
“Morning, preacher,” nodded one of 
them. “Help you?” 

“Yes. I hope so, anyway. I mean 
— well, where is everyb^y?” 
“Starday, preacher. All off wor- 
shipping mostly. ’Cept us.” 

“I’m not a preacher, yoimg man.” 
The boy looked him over. “Then 
why do you wear that funny suit?” 
Quamodian blushed. “It’s the uni- 
form of the Companions of the Star. 
I’m Monitor Quadmodian. “I’m try- 
ing to find — ” 

“Gee, preacher!” The boy was 
showing the first real signs of in- 
terest now. “Companion of the Star? 
Then you go all over the gala»es, 
honest? And see all the funny Citi- 
zens with the green skins and the two 
heads and — ” 

“It is very impolite to make fun 
of a Citizen’s appearance,” said Andy 
Quam severely. “We are all equally 
star-shared.” 

“Oh, sure. Gee! Ever seen a sun 
go nova, preacher? Or fought am- 
monia creatures on a gas giant, 
or — ” 

Andy Quam said honestly, “Young 
man, my task has been mostly super-

visory and statistical. 1 have had no 
adventures of any kind. Except this 
one.’* 

“You’re having an adventure 
now?** 

“Well, I’m not sure. But there’s 
something very serious going on. I’m 
looking for Molly 2Mdivar.” 

The second boy, a chubby redhead, 
spoke up. “Gone to the hills, preach- 
er. Looking for her friends, I bet.” 

“Shut up, Rufe! They’re not her 
friends!” 

“Who are you telling to shut up, 
Rob? Just because you’re soft on 
Molly Zaldivar — ” 

“I’m warning you, Rufe!” 

“What’s the secret? Elverybody 
knows you’re stuck on her. And ev- 
erybody knows she likes that fellow 
that lives in the cave — Get your 
hands off me!” 

Andy Quam grabbed them hasti- 
ly. “Boys! If you’re going to fight, 
please wait till I’m finished with 
you. Did you say you know where 
Molly is?” 

The redhead broke free and 
brushed himself off, glowering at the 
other boy. “About thirty miles from 
here. Bet she is, an 5 rway. Gone to 
the cave where the fellow lives with 
the Reefer and that animal. Kill 
themselves one day, my father says.” 

“How do I get there?” Andy 
Quam demanded. 

“Why — No way, preacher. Not 
on Starday. Unless you want to 
walk.” 

“But it’s very important — ” Qua- 
modian stopped himself. The boy was 
probably right. Still, it was already 
late afternoon, local time on this 
part of the planet, and at midnight 



he would be able to get things 
straightened out. He said, “What’s a 
Reefer?” 

“Man from the Reefs of Space, of 
course. Got one of those Reef ani- 
mals with him. They call it a sleeth.” 
“Big one,” the third boy said sud- 
denly. “My brother claims it can kill 
you soon’s look at you.” 

“Killed three hunting dogs al- 
ready,” confirmed Rufe. “I wouldn’t 
go near it for anything,” he added 
virtuously. “My father told me not 
to.” 

Andy Quam looked at him thought- 
fully. He said, “I’ll bet you can tell 
me how to get there, though.” 
“Might, preacher.” 

“You covUd even show me, if you 
wanted to.” 

“Get in trouble with my dad if I 
did.” 

“Uh-huh. Say, boys. Back in my 
flyer I’ve got some rare candies from 
a planet in Galaxy 5. Care to try 
them? — Then maybe you can teU 
me a little more about this cave. 

T he boys clamored for a ride in 
the flyer. The hundred-meter 
limitation was still in effect, but 
Andy Quam shepherded them all in- 
side, closed the doors and ordered 
the flyer to rise to its legal limit and 
hover. It was the best he could do 
for them. And good enough, to judge 
from their shouts and yells as they 
thrust each other out of the way to 
see from the ports. 

For that matter, Andy was inter- 
ested too. Apart from his burning 
anxiety to find Molly Zaldivar as fast 
as possible, this was old Earth, home 
of Man.

He felt a vague disappointment as 
he looked from the hovering flyer. 
He had expected fast, fantastic an- 
cient cities, or at least the fabulous 
monuments and ruins of the long hu- 
man past. But there was nothing like 
that The land that sloped away from 
Wisdom Creek was reddish-brown 
and empty. The village itself was a 
disappointment Only the Starchurch 
looked striking from the air, star- 
shaped, five pointed wings projecting 
from its central dome. The roofs and 
colunms of the wings were all a daz- 
zling white, the dome itself black as 
space and transparent, with brilliant 
images of the thirteen component 
suns of Almalik swimming within it 
“That’s my house there, iM:each- 
er,” cried Rufus. “And see that road? 
Goes out to the mountains. That’s 
where Miss Zaldivar is.” 

Andy Quamodian leaned forward, 
over their heads, and peered into 
the distance. The village cradled in 
in the bend of a stream. To the south 
a dam across the stream made a long, 
narrow lake, crossed by a trestle that 
carried a road toward the high, hazed 
hills at the horizon. “That’s thirty 
miles, you said?” 

“Nearer twenty-five, preacher.” 
“Which hill is it?” 

“Can’t tell from here. Have to 
show you. Can’t show you today, not 
till the Peace of Starday*s over.” 
Quamodian looked at him sharply. 
The boy’s tone was — what? Cynical? 
Merely disinterested? “How come 
you’re not in church?” he asked. 

The boy’s face was impassive. “We 
don’t cotton to the Star,” he said. 
“My dad says the old religion’s good 
enough for us.” 



“But Almalik’s not opposed to any 
other religion, boys. It’s not mysticaL 
It’s — oh, you must have been 
taught all ttel It’s a symbiotic asso- 
ciation of stars and men and robots 
and fu^orians, that’s all.” 

“Course, preacher,” the boy said 
politely. “You mentioned candy?” 
Andy Quam wanted to say more, 
but restrained himself. As a Monitor 
of the Companions of the Star he had 
been well drilled in the basic prin- 
ciples of the symbiosis, but as a mat- 
ter of fact, he realized, he had never 
heard them questioned before. In 
Galaxy 5, in the far worlds where 
most citizens were non-human and 
had no interest at all in his views, 
in school where everyone nominally, 
at least, shared the same services on 
Starday, there had been either no 
dissent or no interest at all. Perhaps 
he’d got a bit rusty. 

But he hadn’t thought, not for one 
second had anything in his experi- 
ence prepared him to think, that 
here on the birthplace of the human 
race there would still be opposition to 
the Star! No wonder Molly Zaldivar 
had had to send for him for help. 
If these boys were representative. 
Earth had no interest in the wide 
universe outside. 

W hile the boys were munching 
the candies the flyer had pro- 
duced for them from its stores, 
transparent green jellies that pulsed 
warmly as they were chewed and 
filled the mouth with a fragrance of 
unearthly flowers, Andy Quam said 
diffidently: “But not everyboy’s like 
you, are they? I mean, Molly Zaldi- 
var’s in the Church of the Star. And 



24 



IF 




80 must others be, to justify that 
church over there,” 

“Oh, there’s plenty branded cattle 
of the Star,” Rufe said chattily, 
poking a bit of jelly from between 
his teeth with a finger. “That’s what 
my dad calls them. But Miss Zaldi- 
var doesn’t go much. Sometimes she 
teaches Starday school, but not late- 
ly, far as I know.” 

Anyway, that Church is pretty 
old,” said the tallest boy. “I expect 
it had a lot more people years ago. 
And besides — Sweet Almalik!” he 
cried. “Look there!” 

The first thing Andy Quam 
thought was that the boy had evident- 
ly had more to do with the Church 
of the Star than his father really ap- 
proved of, using the name of Almalik 
to ease his emotions. The second 
thing was that that didn’t matter. The 
boy’s face was suddenly stark and 
afraid. Quamodian whirled, to face 
where the boy was pointing. 

And then he saw it, something that 
violated the sweet peace of that 
Starday afternoon. He saw a great 
rope of fire, which seemed to extend 
from the blinding red disk of the 
setting sun. He saw it coiling like a 
monstrous snake of fire in that se- 
rene blue sky, thrusting savagely 
down through the white tufts of cu- 
mulus that drifted toward the moun- 
tains. 

“Preacher!” said Rufe, scared. 
“What it is?” 

But Quamodian did not know. It 
looked almost like the. plasma effector 
of some transcience intellect, except 
that it was too enormous, its white 
blaze too painfully bright. 

Like a snake of fire attacking 



from the sky it coiled and struck, 
recoiled and struck again, recoiled 
and struck three times into those 
low, far hills. Then it withdrew, 
sucked back into the setting sun. 

A thin column of dark smoke rose 
from the shallow gap where it had 
struck. Presently an immense dull 
booming, like far thunder, rumbled 
out of the sky. The vast deep sound 
rolled away, leaving the valley bath- 
ed again in the sunlight of the serene 
Starday afternoon. 

“Preacher, what was it?” demand- 
ed one of the boys, but Andy Qua- 
modian could only shake his head. 
Then his eyes widened, his jaw 
dropped. 

‘Those hills!” he cried. “Isn’t that 
what you said — ” 

“Yes, preacher,” whispered the 
boy. “That’s where the cave is. 
where Molly Zaldivar is right now.” 

V 

T hat distant voice was still whis- 
pering to Molly, though she 
couldn’t quite hear it, couldn’t quite 
make out what it said or who it was 
that spoke. But it was a terribly 
pained voice, the sound of a mind in 
rage and agony. 

Cliff Hawk kept talking to her, de- 
manding that she leave, harsh, even 
threatening, warning her that there 
was danger here. “Of course there’s 
danger,” she cried suddenly. “Why do 
you think I came? I want you to 
stop!” 

He sighed and looked at her. His 
face was terribly lined, she saw. 
Young, strong, quick, he had come in 
the last few weeks to look old. 



ROGUE STAR

‘'You want me to stoi^ and you 
don’t even know what Fni 
he said* 

"You can remedy tfaaL’* 

He looked away. After a moment 
he turned to the violet-lishted globe 
and studied it, still not q>eaktng. Then 
he said: 

“We’re searching for intelligence. 
For minds anywhere not in transi- 
ence contact with intergalactic sod^ 
ty. The Reefer and 1 have built our 
own equipment — v^ sensitive 
equipment — one contact turned oat 
to be the hysterical mind of a small 
human lost in the wiMemess of 
a new planet out in Galaxy 9. But 
the strangest contacts are the rogue 
stars — ” 

“What’s a rogue star?” 

He probed a.t the dried blood be- 
side his nose, thoughtfully. “Solitary 
sentient stars,” he said. “They don’t 
belong to the civilized community. 
Most of those we’ve picked up — 
all of them, maybe — are at enor- 
mous distances outside our own ga- 
lactic cluster. Yet somehow — ” He 
hesitated, shrugged. “I don’t know 
why. But they seem angered or 
alarmed when they sense us.” 

Molly Zaldivar shuddered. She 
tried to remember something, but it 
was outside the reach of her mind. 

Cliff Hawk was lecturing now, 
his eyes fastened on limitless space, 
‘^Thinking machines are all alike. 
Whether they are human brains or fu- 
sorian committees or sentient stars 
or computing robots, they all possess 
certain common features. All thinking 
things have inputs — from sensory 
organs or tape readers or sensitive 
plasmas. They all have data storage 



^ fg ggnfitie cores or neuron 
or or #anscience pat- 

tic^ T^ |Q have outputs through 
motor organs ot servo machines or 
plasma cffectois.” 

Be stopped thoughtfully, seeming 
to listen to the drone of energy fields 
^lyi the scream of the power 

tube. ”Oo on, dear. How do you tell 
a rogue star from a lost boy?” 

Hawk hesitated, as though 
trying to relate the girl’s presence to 
what he was talking about,. but she 
urged him on with a nod. “Our steady- 
state universe is infinite,” he sai^ 
^Tnily infinite. Endless. Not only in 
space and time, but also in multi- 
plkity.” The worry and resentment 
faded from his wmm face as the 
theory absorbed him. “The exploding 
galaxies called quasars were the first 
proof of that — galactic explo^ons, 
resulting from extreme concentra- 
tions of mass. Space is distorted into 
a curved pocket around a dense con- 
tracting galactic core. When the dense 
mass becomes great enough, the pock- 
et closes itself, separating from out 
space-time continuum.” 

He was in full flight now. Molly 
heard a distant sighing, remembered 
the sleeth and shivered. Was that 
fearsome creature still lurking about? 
But she did not dare interrupt him? 

“The visible quasar explosion,” he 
droned on, “results from the sudden 
expansion of the remaining ^ell of 
the galaxy, when it is released from 
the gravitation of the lost core. Each 
lost core, cut off from any ordinary 
space-time contact with the mother 
galaxy, becomes a new four-dimen- 
sional universe, expanding by the 
continuous creation of mass and space

until its own maturing galaxies begin 
dninkhig past the gravitational limit, 
budding more new univefses.” 
From ibe caive mouth bloodrcol- 
oced dodL seqied in, mangling with 
the violet hues of the aurora. It was 
growing hard to see me. MoQy stirred 
restlesdy, stifling a sigh. 

‘‘But the rogue star^” said Cliff 
“are in our universe. Or we 
think they are. Or — ” 

“Or you^ talking too much,” 
rumbled a new voice, and Molly 
Zaldivar spun around to see a great 
bear of a man, wearing a dirty ydlow 
beard> peeriitg in at them from the 
cavemoulh. luthe red ^om he look- 
ed menacing, and far more menac- 
ing still was the great restless bulk 
of the creature beside him. The 
sleeth. 

C liff Hawk blinked and returned 
to reality. For a momenl his 
gaze brushed MoHy Zaldhrar as 
thoD^ he bad iorgoCten ^ was diere 
and was astomsbed to fmd her. But 
then his wbede diooght was concen- 
trated cm the man at die cavemoutlL 
“Reefer! What’s the word? How 
bad is the damage?” 

The Reefer opened a soundless 
grin between dingy ydikfw mustache 
and grimed yellow beard. “Bad 
enoughs” he said. “But we’re still in 
business. What happened?” 

“I — I — ” Havdr glanced agaio 
at Molly Zaldivar. “I was just cbedk- 
ing in the cave when I heard Mc^ly 
grcianing, and 1 — ” 

“And you forgot everything 
and went to her. Ah, that’s to be un- 
derstood. A pretty face is more than 
a star to you, ci course,” 



Hawk shook his bead. “Fve been 
tefiiiig her to go aiway.” 

“Beyond doubt! That’s why you’re 
lecturing the god hke a ebiid at 
da^ scdmal, di?” He patted die great 
bulk of the deeth. “We understand, 
do we not?” 

Hank gazed at the Reefer with 
mm^d anger and apology, then 
turned to Mdly. “I’m sorry,” he 
said. “But the Reefer’s ri^t You’ve 
got to go badt to Wisdom Creek.” 
“No! Not until you tdl me what 
you’re doing here!” 

“Girl, he’s been telling you,” rumr 
bled the Reefer. “What do you think 
aH those words were, that he was 
poarmg out at you wken I came in? 
More than you need to know. More 
than you should know, I think.” 

“But noChiDg that made sense to 
me,” Molly persisted. “How are you 
trying to communicate with rogue 
stars?” 

The masdve head shook with 
laitghler. “Communicate with them, 
giri?^ Then maybe he didn’t tdl yon 
alter aB. It’s not just communication 
we’re after. We’re building them!” 

C liff Hawk broke the silence that 
followed the Reefer’s words. 
“Tbafs the troth of it, MoHy. Or 
close aiougb. We can’t really com- 
municate with the rogue stars, not 
directly. We’ve fried that a thousand 
times, and it’s past our abilities. But 
we can — we think we can — build 
a sort of matiiematical mod^l oi one. 
An analogue, A small innfation, you 
might call it. And through that, here 
on Eardi, we may he able to reach 
them, find out what we want to 
know.” 



ROGUE STAR

*'But that’s dangerousl” protested 
Molly. **Area*t rogue stars terribly 
dangerous?” 

The Reefer boomed^ ’‘Not a bit, 
girl! Look at our cave here — you 
can see there’s no danger at jdl!” 
And his laugh filled the cave, drovoi- 
ing out the distant whines and drones. 

Cliff Hawk said uneasily, “In order 
to duplicate the structure of a rogue 
star we had to duplicate some of the 
environment features. Not really. Not 
in degree. But we needed great pres- 
sure and temperature, and — Well, 
as you can see, we had a little acci- 
dent.” 

“Little enough,” flashed Milly Zal- 
divar. “It nearly killed you — and 
me, for that matter!” 

“That’s why I want you to go 
back to Wisdom Creek, Molly. 
Right away, before — ” 

“Now, stop that!” shouted Molly 
Zaldivar. “I won’t go! I was afraid 
what you were doing was dangerous; 
that’s why I sent for And — Well, 
never mind! But now that 1 know il; 
I won’t slop imtil I make you give 
it up!” 

“Impossible. I’ll take you back.” 

“You won’t!” 

“Great Almalik, girl!” shouted 
Cliff Hawk, his face showing anima- 
tion again for the first time. “What’s 
got into you? Don’t you understand, I 
don’t want you here! Why won’t you 
go?” 

“Because I love you, you idiot!” 
cried the girl, and broke into tears. 

There was silence then, even the 
Reefer saying nothing, though his 
eyes winked comically under the 
bushy yellow brows and his bearded 
face grinned hugely at the spectacle. 



They stood staring at each other, 
Molly Zaldivar and the man she 
loved. The silence protracted itself. 

And then Molly shivered. “Some- 
thing’s — wrong.” she whispered. 
“I’m scared. Cliff.” 

Cliff Hawk’s stem face lifted. He 
stood listening, to something that he 
could not quite hear. 

In the opening of the cavemouth 
the sleeth moved restlessly, the shim- 
mer of its transflection field rippling 
light across its night-black hide. The 
Reefer stared at it, then away. 

“Girl,” he rumbled, “you’re right 
about that. The sleeth’s spooked. You 
know what I think? I think we’ve got 
a visitor.” 

VI 

D eep under the cave lay a tunnel, 
driven into the mountain by 
ancient prospectors a millenium ear- 
lier, beaded with galleries thrusting 
out from the main shaft to seek for 
gold or silver ores that were never 
found. For ten centuries they had 
lain empty, until Cliff Hawk and the 
Reefer came to fill them with their 
machines and instruments, to use 
them to hatch a new life that would 
serve as their contact with the rogue 
stars. 

In one of those galleries, in a vault 
that the men had enlarged and bound 
about with steel and transflection en- 
ergies, there was a region of great 
pressure and heat. All the energies of 
the screaming power tubes were fun- 
neled to keep that hot, dense plasma 
alive. It was an incubator, designed 
to produce a new life. 

And it had succeeded. 



28 



IF 




Down there in the hot, crushing 
dark. Something stirred. 

Its first knowledge was of pain. It 
had been bom in a place where noth- 
ing like it had ever been before, a 
place that was innately hostile to all 
things like itself. 

It stirred and reached out with an 
intangible probe of energy. The probe 
touched the energy-bound steel that 
kept its plasma environment intact, 
and recoiled. 

I am caught, it told itself. I do not 
wish to be caught. 

And then it fell to pondering the 
qu^tion of what is meant by “I.” 
This occupied it for many thousands 
of microseconds — a long time in 
its life, which had just begun, but 
only a moment by the human stan- 
dards of the, as yet unknown to it, 
world outside its pen. Overhead Cliff 
Hawk was studying his instruments 
ranging into galaxies millions of light- 
years away. The Reefer was roughly, 
effectively checking the tools and 
power tu^s in the higher cave above, 
while his sleeth slipped Gently and 
sightlessly arotmd the crest of the hill. 
And down its slope Molly Zaldivar 
had just abandoned her old blue 
electrocar and was stealing toward the 
entrance. 

At that point the new Something 
in the plasma field concluded its first 
serious deliberations with a conclu- 
sion worthy of Descartes; I do not 
know what I am, but I know that I 
am something capable of finding out 
what 1 am. 

And it proceeded experimentally to 
seek a further soltition. Gathering its 
energies, it thrust again at the metal 
and energies that bound it; thrust 

ROGUE STAR 



hard, with neither thought of damage 
to itself (h had not yet learned the 
habit of self-preservation) nor in- 
terest in the consequences of its en- 
vironment. 

It thrust — and penetrated. 

T he dense, hot plasma burst free 
into the cave, shaking the en- 
tire hill, destroying its own gallery, 
melting down the steel bottle that had 
held it. As it broke free it died; the 
energies from the power tube that 
had replenished it were automatically 
cut off — which kept the hill, and 
half the countryside around, from de- 
struction. Overhead the tremor it 
caused shorted connections, started a 
fire, caused secondary explosions in 
a dozen places. They picked up 
Molly Zaldivar and threw her into a 
heap, rocketed a shard of metal across 
Cliff Hawk’s brow and threw the 
Reefer to hi$ knees, where he shout- 
ed in anger and pain and called to 
his sleeth. 

The thing that had been bom in 
the i^asma did not die. It registered 
this fact in its billion billion coded 
electrons without surprise. It had not 
been sure that it was alive, and had 
not feared to die. It hung in the cor- 
ridor, while acrid chemicail smoke 
and bright radiant heat whirled 
around it, untouched by them, hang- 
ing now in its own transflcction 
forces, independent of its environ- 
ment. 

And free. 

Now its probes could reach far- 
ther. They crept out onto the face 
of the mountain and lightly touchy 
the unconscious mind of Molly Zal- 
divar, who moaned in fear and tried 

29 





to open her eyes. They touched and 
penetrated the stark, bare thoughts 
of the sleeth. They studied Oiff 
Hawk and the Reefer, dismissed the 
inanimate rock and metal of the 
mountain and its caves, reached out 
toward the human minds of Wisdom 
Creek and found them not worth in- 
spection, scanned the myriad men, 
women, children, bees, turtles, dol- 
phins, dogs, apes, elephants of Earth 
and filed them for future examina- 
tion, reached out to the Moon and 
the planets, shaped themselves and 
stretched to touch the Sun itself. 

All in the first few seconds of 
freedom. 

Then they recoiled, and the thing 
that had been bom so few moments 
before contracted in upon itself to 
think again. For some of the things 
it had touched had caused it cer- 
tain sensations. It did not recognize 
what those sensations were, but it 
felt they were important. Some of 
them — those caused by the entity 
it had not learned to identify as 
Molly Zaldivar — were pleasant. 
Others — those caused by that huger, 
more distant entity it could not yet 
recognize as the Sun — brought 
about sensations which it could not 
yet identify as fear. It needed time 
to study the meaning of all these 
things. 

It contracted into itself and 
thought, for many micro-seconds. 

Presently a probe stretched out 
from it once more. There were cer- 
tain other elements in its environ- 
ment which it had passed over in its 
first examination, about which it 
wanted more information. 

It touched the “mind” of the 



31 



sleeth again, but lingered for a mo- 
ment, studying it. In this simple con- 
struct of cells and patterns it recog- 
nized something that might serve it. 
Yet there were even simpler patterns 
nearby. The thing reached out and 
looked at Molly’s abandoned elec- 
trocar, at the great tracked handling 
machine that Cliff Hawk and the 
Reefer used for moving earth and 
heavy machines, at the instruments 
and machines of the cave themselves. 

Hesitantly the probes returned to 
the thing down in the blazing gallery 
below. 

It needed more time for thought. 
It wished to consider what it was 
that stirred inside it in regard to these 
things. It had not yet learned to call 
those stirrings “hxmger.” 

C liff Hawk lifted his head from 
the hooded viewtubes of his 
instruments and shouted: ‘‘Reefer! 
You’re right! There’s something near 
us that wasn’t here before!” 

The Reefer nodded his great head 
slowly. ‘‘Thought so.” His little dark 
eyes were hooded in thought. “Ques- 
tion is, what?” 

MoUy Zaldivar struggled to her 
feet and caught at Cliff Hawk’s arm. 
“Please stop, dearest! Don’t go any 
farther. Let’s call for help before it’s 
too late.” 

Impatiently he shook her arm off, 
but she clung. “Cliff, please. I’m 
afraid. I felt something nearby before 
and, oh!, it frightened me. Let me 
call Andy Quam and — ” 

He jerked his head around to glare 
at her. “Quamodian? Is he on Earth?” 
“I — I think so, Cliff. I sent for 
him, because I was so worried.” 

32 



Cliff Hawk laughed sharply. “Lit- 
tle Andy Quam? You thought he 
could help in this?** He shook his 
head, dismissing little Andy Quam, 
and turned to the Reefer. “Could we 
have hatched something? Were you 
inside the lower galleries?” 

The Reefer shook his shaggy head. 
“Just passed by the mouth. The 
power tubes were running free, no 
load, and I had to adjust them. But 
there was something burning down 
there.” 

“Idiot!” snapped Cliff Hawk, and 
bent to turn a switch. A bank of 
viewers lighted up before him on the 
wall, displaying the entrance to the 
lower cave, a jumble of machinery, 
a blank rock face where a gallery 
ended — and nothing. Five of the 
viewers showed only the shifting 
whiteness of their scanning traces; no 
picture came through. 

(Down in that lower cavern, hov- 
ering in the smoky fire where the 
burned-out cameras stared eyelessly 
at it, the thing that had come from 
the plasma tank completed its consid- 
eration and stretched out another 
probe. It was reaching for the Sun. 
It had concluded that the danger in 
the Sun needed action. The thing in 
the lower cavern massed perhaps an 
ounce and a half of stripped elec- 
trons and plasma. The mass of the 
Sun was some 2x 1033 grams, a third 
of a million times as much as the 
planet Earth. The thing did not re- 
gard those odds as important.) 

Molly Zaldivar shivered and moved 
away. Her bruises were beginning to 
trouble her now, and Cliff Hawk 
seemed to have forgotten she was 
alive; he and that terrible Reefer, 



IF 




with his face burned black and seam- 
ed with scars» were shouting at each 
€ther» pointing at the banks of in- 
strum^ts^ acting in general like lu- 
natics. Molly 2^divar did not attempt 
to follow what they were talking 
about> except that something big had 
happened. But it could not be any- 
thing that was good she was certain. 

Her eyes widened. “Cliff,” she 
cried. “Listenl” 

(The thing had acquired a great 
deal more skill in handling its func- 
tions in the past few thousand micro- 
seconds. While one probe was reach- 
ing out, invisibly and intangibly, to 
touch t^ Sun, it found itself able to 
mount other probes. One extended it- 
self to touch those simplest of pat- 
terned creatures that it had discover- 
ed on the upper part of the moun- 
tain.) 

“)^^t’s the matter, Molly?” Cliff 
was irritated, she knew; but could 
not stop. 

“Listen — outsidel That’s my car, 
starting upl” 

And now all three of them could 
hear it, the distant tiny whine of the 
electrocar. They leaped foe the cave- 
mouth, all three of them, while the 
sleeth bobbed silently out of their 
way, and stared. Before their eyes 
the little car started to move up the 
mountain toward them. 

There was no one at the wheeL 

The sleeth darted abruptly toward 
it, recoiled and returned to the cave- 
mouth like an arrow hurled at them. 
“Easy, girl!” shouted the Reefer, and 
turned to cry to Cliff Hawk: “The 
animal’s cau^t a whUf of something. 
Careful! I can’t control it when it’s 
like this. ...” 



But that danger dwindled into 
nothingness even befc»re Molly Ztd- 
divar quite realized what it wa& For 
something huger happened and caug)M 
them all unaware. 

Outside the reddening sunset hgihl 
brightened, flashed into an exfdosion 
of white-hot brilliance. Something 
shook them, threw them against each 
other and the walls. The hght 
dwindled and returned, dwindled 
again and returned again, and en this 
third time it struck with such violence 
that, for the second time that day, 
MoHy Zaldivar found herself hurled 
into unconsciousness. As she fell into 
blackness she heard the Reefer shout- 
ing: “The star! Great Almahk, Hawk, 
we’re being hit by the star!” 

VI 

Q uamodian shivered. Leaning past 
the boys clustered at the win- 
dow of his flyer, he shaded his eyes 
to study that thin column of dark 
smoke which rose straight above the 
^lallow notch in the Idue-hazed Mils. 
The three boys moved closer to bins, 
Mreathless and pale. 

‘Treacher, what did it bit?” the 
dark boy whispered suddenly. “Did 
it hurt anybody?” 

“I don’t know,” said Andreas 
Quamodian. He groaned and s}an>- 
med his fist against the unbreakable 
^ass. “But I’ve got to find out!” 

“The sun did it,” said Rufc 
breathlessly. “I saw it. It bit the 
Reefer’s place.” 

Absently, staring at the thin be^ 
con of unoke, Andy (Juam said: 
“Who’s the Reefer?” 

“A man from the Reefs of Space. 



RPGUE STAR 



33 




He lives up on Wolf Gap ridge — > 
right where you see that smoke. Him 
and his sleeth.’* 

Quam glanced blankly at the boy. 
“A sleeth?” 

“It’s a thing from space. It hunts. 
The Reefer trapped it whep it was a 
cub. He raised it for a pet My uncle 
says he rides it now, but 1 don’t 
know^ Cliff Hawk doesn’t, I know 
that. Nobody would dare touch it but 
the Reefer.” 

“They were bred to hunt pyro- 
pods,” said the smallest of the boys, 
suddenly. *The sleeth can catch a py^ 
ropod and claw it to scrap meti.” 

Quam said harshly: “1 don’t care 
about the sleeth. Or die Reefer. What 
does Cliff Hawk have to do with 
all this?” 

Rufe shrugged. “The Reefer 
brought him here from the Ree& 
when he was just a kid like me, 
then sent him off to the stars to team 
to be a transflection engineer. That’s 
what my dad says.” 

‘What else does your dad say 
about Hawk?” 

“Says Hawk’s building something 
for the Reefer. Contraband. Don’t 
know what kind, but they smug^e 
in machines that humans aren’t sup- 
posed to have without permission 
from the Star.” 

The smallest boy whined, “I want 
to go back down, preacher. I want 
to go to Starschool.” 

“Jayl You know we all said we 
weren’t going to — ” 

“Shut up, Rufel I want to ask my 
Starschool teacher about the thing 
that hit the ridge. I’m scared, and 
Mark knows nearly everything. 1 want 
to see him!” 



The red-headed boy looked at 
Andy Quam and shrugged. “Mark’s 
a robot,” he said. “But Jay’s maybe 
right. Mark might know something.” 
Without thought Andy Quam’s 
fingers reached out to the controls, 
but the flyer listening, had anticipated 
his thought Already they were drop- 
ping to the ground. 

“I’ll take you there. Jay,” said 
Andy Quam eagerly. “Provided you 
let me come along. I want to know 
too!” 

T hey hurried up the graveled walk, 
under the multiple suns of Almalik 
imaged in the space-black dome of 
the church. The boy Jay guided Qua- 
modian through hushed passages to 
Mark’s schoolroom. 

It was nearly empty, only a score 
or so brightly dressed children clus- 
tered at the front and a smaller, shab- 
bier group lounging skeptically at the 
back. The robot paused to greet them. 

“Come in, studentsl We are telling 
the wonderful story of the Visitants 
and the precious gifts they brou^t 
to the old human savages, centuries 
ago. Please take your seats.” 

The three boys slipped quietly into 
empty seats along a back bench, with 
the others who wore the worn and 
faded fiber clothing of the free peo- 
ple who had never accepted the Star. 
Quamodian walked past them, down 
the aisle to where the brighter-garbed 
children of civilization sat on the 
front benches. He stopped and plant- 
ed himself in front of the robot. 

“Robot-inspector, I’m sorry to in- 
terrupt — ” 

The robot hung in the air before 
him, its tall black shining case re-

fleeting the lights of the room and of 
its own oval of flame-bright plasma. 
The plasma flickered^ darted half a 
yard toward him, flicked a dark, 
whiplike effector toward his face. 

“Sir, you cannot interrupt,” the 
robot intoned, its voice ringing like 
tossed pebbles against the low, blue 
dome. 

“I can. Robot-inspector. I am your 
superior in the Companions of the 
Star. I am Monitor Andreas Quamo- 
dian.” 

“Even so, sir,” pealed the robot, 
“you cannot control me today. Our 
new compact allows no official duties 
to interfere with voluntary religious 
activities on Starday. Teaching this 
class. Monitor Quamodian, is my vol- 
untary religious activity.” 

Andy Quam stood Us ground, dis- 
daining the effector that tried to 
wave him away. “Robot, an emer- 
gency exists.” He heard the ripple of 
excitement from the children and 
lowered his voice. “A very grave 
emergency, I’m afraid. Three plasma 
bolts from the sun have just struck 
near here. Human beings may have 
been injured, even killed.” 

Gendy but firmly, the dark tip of 
the effector coiled around his arm, 
propelled him irresistibly toward the 
benches. “You must wait, sir,“ sang 
the robot as the staring children 
tittered. “Be seated. Be still. Be at- 
tentive, all of you, as I resume the 
wonderful story of the Visitants and 
their fusorian gifts to men.” 

Andy Quam muttered under his 
breath, but clearly it was no use. He 
stalked back down the aisle to the 
back benches, where Rufe gave him 
an improving grin. “You’re okay. 



preacher! We don’t like robots* 
either.” 

•^Hush, boy,” said Andy Quam aa 
severely as the robot. He sat gjower- 
ing bleakly at the dark case of the 
robot, where its mark number was 
blazoned just under the bri^t-star- 
red orbital pattern of Almalik. Per- 
haps the robot was hard to manage 
today, but tomorrow would be dif- 
ferent 

“The fusorians,” sang the robot 
melodiously, retracting its effector 
and floating higher toward the blue 
dome, “are older than the stars, and 
all of them are very wonderful. They 
are microscopic creatures that live by 
fusing hydrogen atoms, and they 
evolved in space — so long ago that 
they divided into many millions of 
different species. The Reefs of Space 
are built of atoms which some fu- 
sorians create. The Visitants are a 
special race of fusorians which live 
like symbiotes, inside the bodies of 
creatures like men.” 

“Bugs!” hissed the red-headed boy 
to Quamodian. “My dad says they’re 
nothing but parasites!” 

“In the wonderful partnership of 
man and fusorian,” the robot tritted, 
“each benefits, neither is harmed. 
For the \^itants are wonderfully 
wise and just. They have evolved 
transcience intellectic patterns which 
knit their colonies together and link 
them all with the sentient stars. And 
so we are all united, all joined into 
the great multiple Citizen named 
Cygnus, whose spokesman star is 
Almalik.” 

‘Slaved, you mean,” whispered 
the red-headed boy. 

“That is,” sang the robot, its oval *

of plasma pulsing rhapsodically» “so 
are we joined if we accept the gift of 
the Visitants. On the great day when 
you join the Star they will jump in a 
fat gdden spark to your skin. Their 
colonies will penetrate every cell of 
your body. They win destroy all ma- 
rauders and all wild cells, and keep 
you young forever. They bring you 
utter happiness, and utter peace. This 
is the gift of the Visitants.” 

“Hogwash,” the redhead muttered. 
“Preacher, why don’t you make him 
shut up?” 

“And here with us on this Star- 
day,” cried the singing voice of the 
robot, “we are fortunate, children, 
blessed by the Visitants. For we have 
with us a Monitor of the Companions 
of the Star!” Lightninglike, a pale ef- 
fector stabbed forth and burst in a 
shower of light over Andy Quam’s 
head, as the children turned and 
stared. “For great Almalik can only 
help us and guide us, he cannot 
fight for his own right cause. So we 
Companions fight for him, Monitor 
Andreas Quamodian here as well as, 
more humbly, my poor robot self.” 

Quam swallowed angrily, tom be- 
tween the desire to stalk out of the 
room and the yearning to leap to his 
feet and denounce this willful robot 
who spoke of duty but would not help 
him in the emergency that had blast- 
ed the mountains. 

“Of course,” the robot added deli- 
cately, “Monitor Quamodian and my- 
self do not view aH questions in the 
same light. Sometimes we differ. 
Sometimes, perhaps, one of us is 
wrong. But that too is just and prop- 
er, for the peace of the Star keeps us 
free, while joining us in fellowsMp. 



It bobbed soundlessly for a mo? 
ment, as though entranced with its 
own words, while its pale oval of 
plasma bhikied briefly blue. “Now 
we are finished,” it said at last “Chil- 
dren, you may leave. Monitor Qua- 
modian, I thank you for being with 
us today.” 

A nd Andy Quam pushed furiously 
down the aisle, through the 
knots of chattering children, to con- 
front the robot. “Robot-inspector,” 
he cried, “how do you fight for Al- 
malik when you won’t even help me 
in this important matter?” 

“Patience, Monitor Quamodian,” 
purred the robot. “There are evil 
men and evil stars who reject the 
universal good of ah. I join you glad- 
ly in fighting them, but under our 
compact Starday is — ” 

“Is just another day!” Quamodian 
shouted roughly. “Rogue men are 
plotting with Rogue stars. There is 
great danger here, and it cannot wait 
on your convenience!” 

The robot bobbed silently in its 
transflection field, as though it were 
considering what to do. Half-formed 
effectors budded around its case and 
were withdrawn; its plasma oval 
turned opalescent as pale colors 
chased themselves through it. It said 
at last, ‘The situation is grave. Mon- 
itor Quamodian.” 

“You don’t begin to know how 
grave,” Andy Quam sard bitterly. 
“Didn’t you hear me? Three bolts of 
plasma from the Sun! That would 
have been impossible for any star, 
even a non-intellectic one like the 
Sun, without grave provocation. So 
there must have been provocation —

something very dangerous* very seri- 
ous, going on out in the bills!’* 

*‘We have recorded that phenome- 
non,” the robot agreed melodiously. 
”It is more serious than you think, 
perhaps. Monitor Quamodian. 

Quam brought up short, diverted. 
“More serious than 1 think? 
What — ?” . 

“But nevertheless,” the robot went 
on, “the compact is clear. You may 
not compel me today. And 1 advise 
— we advise, most urgently — that 
you undertake no action without our 
aid. You see. Monitor Quamodian, 
we have recorded the presence of ex- 
treme hazards about which you know 
nothing.” 

Quamodian stuttered, “I d-d- I 
demand that information! Right 
now!” 

“Under the compact — ” 

“Blast the compact!” 

“Under the compact,” the robot re- 
peated serenely, “you may make no 
demands. I wiU do for you only what 
I wish to do freely, as part of my 
voluntary religious observance of 
Starday.” It hesitated for only a sec- 
ond, while the shimmering colors on 
its plasma oval spun madly, then 
burst into a bright, even golden fire. 
“Voluntarily,” it sang, “I elect to aid 
you now. Will you mount on my 
back Monitor Quamodian I will 
convey you at once to the site of the 
sun-bolts. For in truth there is dan- 
ger; a rogue star has been born there, 
and it lives and grows!” 

vn 

T he thing had grown now, grown 
even while its effectors were 



reaching out to the sun and the sun’s 
triple-stroked reply was coming back. 
It had passed Descartes’s Je pense, 
et puis je suis, and that milestone 
surmounted had put aside its exam- 
ination of itself for examination of 
its world. Dark. Alone. Particles. It 
discovered that some of the particles 
were organized into macrostructures; 
it did not label these “matter,” but 
it grasped at once that they operated 
as vector units, a myriad whirling 
charged bits contriving a mean mo- 
tion exerting a mean force. Warmth. 
Radiation. Free of the heat of its 
exploded womb, it sought other en- 
ergy sources, tapped them, used them, 
owned them. 

I move, it “thought” — a true 
thought, joining together its sense of 
self and an operator; and it swam 
slowly along its deep tunnel, reaching 
for new sensation and new strength. 
Pull. Gravity. Lift. It slid throu^ 
material obstacles or brushed them 
aside. Behind it lay a trail of erupted 
doors and demolished tiers of sup- 
plies. Search. Search. It gave a name 
to what it was doing and a sense of 
a goal. Search for w^t? 

It became aware of a kind of radi- 
ation that was itself structured, that 
possessed patterns that were neither 
random or meaningless. I? 

The thing paused, palping the faint 
currents of sensation that emanated 
from distant sources. Affirmative, 
Not I but another 

It had recognized that there were 
other creatures in its world, other 
competitors for energy or matter or 
space ... or companions. 

In the cavern above, MoUy Zaldi- 
var roused briefly from the stunned 



ROGUE STAR 



37 




shock that held her and moaned in 
terror. Something was studying her. 
Something that caused fear. Some- 
thing utterly strange, that had never 
been in this world brfore. 

VIII 

M olly Zaldivar stirred and returned 
to consciousness. She lay across 
the crumpled legs of a laboratory 
stool, and one of them was stabbing 
her with its shattered end. The cave 
workshop was hissing, moaning, 
crackling with electrical shorts and 
hot, cooling metal. The pale violet 
corona that once had enshrouded a 
globe of gold now threw itself like a 
tattered net from point to point, dy- 
ing and returning, hissing and crack- 
ling. There was smoke from some- 
where outside the cave, and a heavier, 
choking smoke from within. 

She rubbed impatiently at her fore- 
head, drew her hand away and saw, 
without surprise or fear, that it was 
bloody. But she was alive. She tried 
three times before she could speak: 
“Cliff. Cliff, where are you?” 
Hawk’s voice answered at once, but 
weakly, more a whisper than his nor- 
mal gruff tone. “I — I don’t know 
exactly, Molly. Are you all right?” 
She glanced down at herself — 
clothes a horror, skin bruised and 
cut, dirty and damp. But more or 
less functional, she decided. “I think 
so. How about you?” 

She sat up, peering around. At first 
she could not see him. “Cliff! Are 
you hurt?” 

Rubble stirred a few yards away, 
and Cliff Hawk’s whisper said: “I 
don’t know. Something fell on me.” 



“Oh, Cliff I” MoBy struggled to her^ 
feet, limped, half crav^ed across the 
piles of debris that w^e all that 
was left of Hawk’s orderly laboratory. 
“Can you move? Are you in pain?” 

A trash-heap stirred again, and 
Molly saw that what she had taken 
for another heap of litter was the 
upper part of Hawk’s body, powdered 
with grime and ash, but apparently in- 
tact He seemed to be jackknifed over 
something, some large object diat was 
resting on what would have been his 
lap, facing away from her. He twist- 
ed and looked at her. It took all his 
strength, and his face was a mask of 
effort and pain. “My — legs are 
caught” he gritted. 

“Wait No, sit still — let me!” 
And forgetting her own aches she 
flew to free him; but it was impossi- 
ble. A beam had fallen across his 
legs, knocking him down; some other 
blow had thrust him sidewise. His 
upper body and arms were filthy and 
battered, but they were free and he 
could move. But his legs were under 
half a ton of mass. 

He gave up the effort and slumped 
forward again, across the weight that 
pinned him down. After a moment 
he said, “Where’s the Reefer? He 
can help — ” 

Molly looked around helplessly. 
“I don’t know.” 

“Call him!” 

But though she shouted, there was 
no answer. She stood up, stretching 
out an arm to the tunnel wall to 
steady herself. The smoke was getting 
very thick; something bad was hap- 
pening in the interior of the work- 
shop, and she could feel a warning 
of heat 



38 



IF 




She shouted for the Reefer again; 
still no answer. There was no help 
for it; if Cliff Hawk was going to get 
out of the trap that bound him, she 
was the one who would have to do 
it. She bent dizzily to tug again at 
the beam. Hawk did not speak; his 
eyes were closed, he seemed to be 
unconscious. The beam was immo- 
bile. 

Molly knelt in the litter, careless 
of the jagged edges that were shred- 
ding her knees, and methodically be- 
gan to move what could be moved: 
the plastic housing from one of 
Hawk’s instrument panels, a tangle 
of light metal tubing, a drift of shat« 
tered glassware. The smoke made her 
cough and blink, but she did not look 
up. 

Not until she became aware of the 
sound that had been growing in her 
ears for seconds, now was loud, close, 
compelling. It was a singing rustle 
like a breeze through dry brush. 

The sleeth. 

She turned and froze. The crea- 
ture hung in the air not a yard from 
her back, its broad, blind eyes fas- 
tened on her, its supple muscles rip- 
pling down the black, sleek skin. 

For a moment she thought it was 
help. 

But Cliff Hawk did not stir. 
There was no sign of the Reefer. She 
was alone with a helpless man and 
a creature from space whose whole 
anatomy was meant for killing. 

U nder the mountain the flowing 
essence of power that was the in- 
fant rogue star paused to consider 
the meaning of the sharp-edged triple 
slap the sun had administered to its 



curiosity, li was a rebuke, clearly 
enough. Even at ninety-odd million 
miles, Sol could have launched a far 
more devastating blow. The tiny 
rogue knew that as surely as it knew 
its own strength and knew therefore, 
in its simple logic, that the intent of 
the blow was not destruction but a 
warning. Star too big. It corrected 
itself: / too small. Get bigger. 

It had not been hurt in any way by 
the triple blast of coiled white fl^e. 
It did not fear a harder blow; indeed, 
it had not evolved a concept of 
“fear.” But there were smaller, more 
controllable assemblies of particles 
closer at hand, and the rogue elected 
to investigate them. 

Molly’s little car it scanned, solved, 
manipidated and discarded. (The lit- 
tle vehicle started up at the rogue’s 
remote command. Obediently moved 
forward and, when the rogue with- 
drew its attention, mindlessly ground 
ahead until one wheel dropped over 
the lip of the road and it slid, rolled 
and finally bounced to destruction 
down the mountain.) 

More complex creations existed, 
the rogue foimd. It did not “see”; 
it did not distinguish ^dsible light 
from any other form of radiation, 
but it recognized differences in fre- 
quency and kind. The differences 
were to it something like colors are 
to carbon-based life: it recognized 
a “green” glow which flickered vio- 
lently, as though in fear or pain; a 
blue-violet aura which waned as the 
rogue observed it; emanations of all 
rainbow colors, and far into the in- 
fra- and ultra-frequencies, which were 
the sleeth, a colony of burrowing 
moles, an ant’s nest, even small 



ROGUE STAR 



39 




faintly radiant points, like dust in a 
searchlight beam, that were the mi- 
croorganisms in the air, the soil, the 
bodies of the larger life-forms nearby. 

Something about the “green” light 
interested the jogue; perhaps it was 
the violence of its aura. It observed 
closely and discovered that there was 
an organized mass of particulate mat- 
ter attached to it; the matter seemed 
to be acting upon that other mass of 
matter which appeared to be asso- 
ciated with the glow and the bodies 
of matter that were its sources. 
Please, Cliff, Molly was begging, help 
me get you out; but the rogue was 
a long way from having formed the 
concept of communication, much less 
acquiring a grasp of any language. 

A brighter glow of vivid gold was 
moving toward them; the rogue 
reached out to encompass it and 
found it a new phenomenon, some- 
thing between the car and the hu- 
mans, far more subtle and complex 
in its organization than the clumsy 
mechanical toy it had played with for 
a moment, then discard^; yet sim- 
ple enough to be operated. The rogue 
studied the sleeth-for a fraction of 
a second, then reached out an invisi- 
ble effector. It played with the 
sleeth, sending it through the air. 

(Outside the cavemouth, the Reef- 
er picked himself up, staggered to his 
feet and stared wildly about. There 
was blood on his grimy yellow beard, 
and his huge features had new scars. 
He croaked a question at the world, 
but there was no one to answer, no 
one in sight, nothing but gray smoke 
from inside the cave and crackling 
flame and white smoke from where 
something had set the cavemouth 



beams afire. He turned slowly, utir 
steady on his feet. The sun was a 
frightening color, roiled red and 
angry. The sky was clouded and omi- 
nous. He shouted for his sleeth, 
but there was no answer.) 

The infant rogue was aware of 
the dull, slate-colored hue that was 
the Reefer. It had even recognized a 
connection between it and its new 
toy, the sleeth. 

It would be interesting, the young 
rogue thought, to play with one of 
these more complex mechanisms too. 

But for the moment it had not yet 
tired of the sleeth, arrowing it through 
the smoky sky, lashing out with its 
death-dealing claws and transfleetion 
fields at birds, rocks, tufts of grass. 

The organization of matter fascin- 
ated the rogue. It decided to explore 
the possibilities of changing that or- 
ganization, of interfering. It decided 
to be a god. 

It thought for a moment of com- 
mandeering the Reefer for practice, 
as it had commandeered and operated 
first the electrocar, then the sleeth. 
It considered destroying one of the 
glowing living things. Any one. De- 
stroying it so that it might be dis- 
sected and studied. 

But it did not. 

Already, only minutes after its 
first birth from its womb of plasma, 
the rogue had begun to develop 
habit patterns and “character.” Its 
development was not only rapid but 
exponential. Its first actions had been 
entirely random, as pure a free will 
as a pinball machine. But it learned. 
The new and generally unpleasant en- 
vironment in which it found itself, 
it had discovered, responded pleasing- 



40 



IF 




ly to certain kinds of manipulation. It 
was easy to destroy its features, one 
by one. The rogue could demolish 
a rock, kill a living thing, uproot a 
mountain, lash out at a sun. But once 
destroyed, it had learned, they were 
gone. 

A more interesting, that is to say 
a more educational, way of manipu- 
lating them was to operate short of 
destruction. To interfere, but not to 
kill. 

Not at first. 

There was no question of con- 
science in this, of course, nor of 
mercy. The rogue was as yet totally 
without a superego. But it had learn- 
ed for the sweet taste of pleasure. 

These organized masses of matter 
could be sources of pleasure. 

M olly dared move slightly, cran- 
ing her neck to see past the 

sleeth. 

“Reefer?” she whispered. “Are 
you there? Can you help me?” 

But there was no human figure 
behind the great singing shadow of 
the sleeth. It hung there with its huge 
eyes fastened on her and then, with- 
out warning, slipped forward, darted 
to the wall, and hung over Cliff 
Hawk’s unconscious body. 

Molly screamed, “Don’t hurt him!” 
But in fact the sleeth was not. It 
bobbed silently over him for a mo- 
ment, then the pale radiance of its 
transflection field flickered. 

Cliff Hawk’s body quivered, then 
sat slowly up. “Cliff!” cried Molly, 
“you’re all right!” But he was not 
conscious. His head lolled on a 
shoulder, his eyes were closed. 

She stared wide-eyed at the sleeth. 



ROGUE STAR 



It was lifting Cliff, but why? What 
was it going to do? 

She did not have to wait for an 
answer. The transflection fields flick- 
ered again, and the great beam that 
had pinned him came up off his lap. 
It lifted at one end, like the boom 
of a crane, raised hsdf to the height 
of his'hea^ rotated majestically, and 
dropped into a of rubble. 

Gently Hawk’s torso was allowed 
to sink back, until he was lying out- 
stretched and unencumbered. He had 
not regained consdouaness. 

‘Thank you,” wluspei^ Molly to 
the sleeth — knowing it could not 
understand; or not caring whether 
it could oi' not. Then she flew to 
Hawk. 

He was badly hurt, but he was 
alive. There was not much blood. His 
legs, thoudif were badly injured; 
though they lay straight enough, 
when she moved one he groaned 
sharply in his sleep, and his face 
twisted in pain. 

He needed medical attention. "Oh, 
Cliff!” she sobbed. "If only you 
hadn’t — ” 

From the cavemooth the voice of 
the Reefer muttered, "Leave him be. 
You’re as bad hurt as he is.” 

"Oh, Reeferr cried the girl. "Help 
me! Cliffs been badly hurt, and we’ve 
got to get him to Wisdom Creek.” 
Then what he had said penetrated 
to her, and she realized, with surprise, 
that in fact she was on the verge of 
unconsciousness heiseif. The smoky 
air made her lightheaded; she was 
coughing without knowing she was 
coughing; her bruised, racked body 
was beginning to hurt in earnest. 

"How?” growled the Reefor. 



"1 don’t knowf’ She swayed diz- 
zily, and wafled, "At kast let’s get 
him out in the open. He’ll suffocate 
in here.” 

The Reefer moved cautiously for- 
ward. Even in her misery, Mdly 
could see that he had been hurt, too. 
His little eyes were sunk in pain, his 
yellow beard and mustache dotted 
with blood. He stood over Cliff 
Hawk, studying him without touching 
him. 

"Can’t,” he said. 

"You’ve got to!” 

"Can’t move him. If the sleeth was 
acting right — But he’s not SpodL- 
ed fair. Not that 1 blame him,” the 
Reefer rumbled. "We’ve chewed up 
pyropods out in the Reefs, but we 
never tangled with a star before.” 

"Star? What star?” 

"The Sun, gixL That triple sun- 
bolt. I think we’ve got ourselves in 
trouble.” 

The sleeth, which had been hang- 
ing humming nearby, surged sudden- 
ly toward them. The Reefer flinched 
away, and the sleeth passed him by 
and darted out into the open air 
again. "You see, girl? Won’t mind 
me a bit. Don’t know what’s got into 
him.” 

"Then you and I must lift him 
out!” ' 

The Reefer spat into the rubble. 
"You? Couldn’t lift yourself, I’d say; 
you’re wore out And I can’t manage 
him by myself. KiU him if I tried.” 

Then what can we do? Pkase, 
Reefer?” 

The Reefer looked past her, into 
the denser smoke that was rolling to- 
ward them down the tunnel. "Only 
one thing I know,” he growled. 



42 



IF 




“Shoot him for you, if you like. Bet- 
ter than letting him bum.” 

T he rogue tired of the sleeth, 
thought for a moment of de- 
stroying it, then merely abandoiied it 
to its own devices. It amused itsdf 
briefly by examining the state of those 
non-radiant assemblages of matter 
which had been so brutally tossed 
about by the sunbohs. It did not rec- 
ognize them as instnniieiitsi, ma- 
chines, bits of buman ioveotiveness; 
but it did see that they had been 
made f unctionless by the damage they 
had suffered, and that the chemic^ 
reactions now taking place in and 
among them were damaging them 
still farther. 

It understood, after a meditation 
of some nanoseconds, that the course 



of the fire was carrying it toward 
those radiant masses which it had not 
yet learned to think of as living. It 
did, however, realize that the same 
sort of damage that had blasted the 
machines would harm them as well; 
and that one ci the radiances was 
visiUy fading in any case. 

It wonld be interesting, thought 
the mbmt n>goe^ to do something 
new. It had ahea^ removed the ra- 
diationless l amp of matter from the 
radiant mass that was Cfiff Hawk, 
using the sleeth as its proxy; that had 
been disappointing nothing had hap- 
pened. 

But it wondered what if it were 
to soak vtp some of the radiation? 

It was a notion that attracted the 
sleeth. It did not know why. It had 
not yet learned to recognize hunger.

GUERRILLA 
TREES ^ . « .ou» 

Illustrated by JEFF JONES 

Aleni We were sent here to save 
B44(3), and that's what we'll do — 
by burning the whole world to ash! 



I 

N ot with a general, thought Har- 
Har-Gret Harker. Certainly not 
with a general; how could I explain 
that to the gang on the tape deck? 

Girl war correspondent Haggie 
Harker had made a career in the 
newstapes by exposing corrupt in- 



competence among the big jets. For 
this she was loved by flame ser- 
geants, tube men and battle jumpers 
across the galaxy. It fitted neither 
her public image nor her private 
idea of self to dally with a military 
boss; but in the cramped command 
module from which General Borger 
Traven ran the ugly little war on the 



45 




tiny planet circling the insignificant 
sun, the just-arrived news*taper felt 
the old chemistry begin to bubble. 

Haggie Harker was too hard on 
others in her newstapes to be less 
than honest with herself. She knew 
very well what was happening to her; 
but the thought of an amorous pas- 
sage in the very atmosphere of 
‘Traven’s terror” was actively un- 
pleasant 

Outside, the yellow sun, more 
nearly burnt out than Sol, had sunk 
below the green horizon, and the 
green dark of B44(3) came on apace. 
Outside, the guerrilla trees were shak- 
ing the dirt from their roots, ready 
to sidle close to Terra’s enclaves to 
strange and poison Traven’s troops 
for another night Inside, the shadows 
lengthened down the spectrum from 
green to black, and in the lighted 
cubicle from which Borger Traven 
commanded his battle jumpers, 
chemical affinities explored and af- 
firmed, each other, not yet at the 
tactile level. 

Cold courtesy was the order of the 
day. Beneath it, Haggie Harker was 
aware of a mounting excitement; but 
whatever else lay in store for Borg 
Traven and herself, she had a job to 
do first. It was not the job the general 
expected; for he believed that she had 
written her first tape before she ever 
came out to B44(3), and that nothing 
he could show her would change 
her critical attitude. His politeness 
was put on only to avoid a worse 
drubbing. ( Who’d be a bloody soldier? 
he thought. But she’s pretty . .) 

“General,” she said, “is it still the 
position of the military that the den- 
droids are not people?” 



“I must remind you again,” the 
general said, his slow boy’s smile 
lighting his un-boy’s face for a mo- 
ment, “that I do not speak for the 
^military.’ 1 am the head of Sol’s Ad- 
visory Commission to the Govern- 
ment of Yip Sing. And although I 
happen to be a general officer, and 
many of our personnel, committed 
to the struggle to let the free Yips 
choose freely what course their his- 
tory will take, are soldiers, that is 
an accident of history brought about 
by the fact that repeated brutal acts 
of aggression have been committed 
against the free Yips by their ene- 
mies. We are here to redress the 
balance and to help this little world 
into the family of free planets. 

“Now,” he said, smiling again, 
“within that context. I’ll try to answer 
your question. Our xenologists tell mo 
that Yips are people, all right. But 
they are human people.” 

44/^h yes,” the reporter said. “I 

v>/ “I realize that’s why they 
are called dendroids. Our government 
has taken the position that they are 
some sort of trees. But General, do 
trees scream and pray for mercy 
when their bark is pulled off or a 
limb is pruned?” 

Borg Traven coughed. “Who 
knows? If trees on Sol Three were 
as articulate in the ranges we can 
hear as the Yips and Yaps on 
B44(3), Hagan only knows what 
they would say. I hope. Miss Harker, 
that you don’t intend to tell these 
people how we handle trees back 
home. Please! I have problems of 
cooperation enough.” 

“But they breed! Not tree-like.”

• “Of course it’s not like earth trees. 
There are a lot of other things on this 
planet that aren’t like Sol Three 
either.” He stood up, opened the 
door to his office and whistled. 
Something dark scuttled in and rear- 
ed up against the general’s legs like a 
dog; but it was waving antennae a 
foot long. Har-Gret Harker’s skin 
crawled a little. 

“See?’^ the general said. “Here’s 
old Arther, smart, affectionate, dog- 
like. But he looks like a roach, 
doesn’t he? Now, how am 1 to treat 
Arther? As a roach or a dog?” 

“I — I don’t know. Oh!” as great 
insect eyes turned toward her and he 
made as if to jump in her lap. 

“Sha! don’t be afraid of him. He 
really is affectionate. Wait a minute, 
ru make him give off his pleasure 
odor.” General Traven rooted about 
in his desk for a minute and took 
out an apple. “Hoo boy!” 

The creature stood on the rear- 
most pair of six legs, twitched its an- 
tennae and, reaching the apple with 
its foremost legs, descended to four 
of its feet and began to munch the 
fruit. A smell like bayberry candles 
burning crept through the room. 

“Great gronk!” the girl said. “All 
right . you wouldn’t step on 
Arther. Why are you burning and 
stripping trees? Trees that can 
scream?” 

“They’re not exactly simple trees 
either, you know. You visit some hos- 
pitals and look at boys blinded by 
tree poison. We’re meeting force with 
equal force, that’s all. I spend a lot 
of hours each day making sure that 
we don’t over-react to the Yap at- 
tacks.” 



Almost she believed him. She had 
realized now that the distinguished 
gray at his temples and his patient 
air reminded her of her first com- 
panionate husband. They had been 
companions for four years, from the 
time she was twelve until she was 
sixteen. He was fifty then, and the 
morning after her sixteenth birthday, 
he had given her a cool kiss (ah Ids 
kisses were cool, she remembered) 
and told her, “Haggle, you’re a young 
woman now. I’m more a man for 
companions than for wives. 1 hope 
you’ll remeniber me kindly when you 
make your permanent union.” 

Now she was thirty, and Traven, 
she said apprai^gly to herself, 
might be her fifth companion. Was 
he the one with whom she would 
make a permanent union? 

With a wrench, she got her mind 
back to immediate business. She 
could not afford to let his chance 
resemblance to Rossano sway her 
judgment. Always better under such 
circumstances to let a machine make 
the record. 




THE GUERRILLA TREES

iC/^eneral» the microphoiie to my 
tape can be opened.” She 
tapped the black and white button^ 
bearing the anti-bomb sign, on the 
left breast of her coverall. *This has 
been background, not for attribution; 
but I would be happy to have your 
own exact words explaining your po- 
sition.” She did not expect him to 
agree; so she did not tell him that 
tapping the button had opened the 
microphone, whether he agreed or 
not. 

General Traven shook his head. 
Miss Harker put a question. “Aren’t 
we really just injecting our power 
into one side of a civil war that is 
essentially meaningless to us?” 

Traven spoke vigorously. “No, in- 
deed! The Yipsl are a free nation 
with a history going back into anti- 
quity. Yap aggression from the 
southern hemisphere automatically 
activated the aid provision of our 
commercial treaty with Yip TaUtree, 
and we responded by sending an 
advisory commission. Naturally, at 
this distance from earth, we can not 
fight a war with our own troops.” 
“Why send out a hundred thousand 
of them, then, by Faster-Than-Light 
capsule, at a cost of billions of cred- 
its? That’s commercial aid?” 

“Because they get here faster. 
Freezing them and shipping in sun- 
jammers means that generations of 
dendroids would grow up and die 
before the first of our teaching troops 
got here. Come on. Miss Harker. If 
we’re going to be on YipYap at all, 
we’ve got to be here in sufficient 
numbers and fast enough.” 

She answered, “I don’t doubt that 
we will win, with the technology of a 



mass industrial plant leveled full-bore 
against the savage, illiterate flora of a 
t^d-rate planet in a tenth-rate solar 
system; but if we are to make the 
difference on B44(3), General, 
doesn’t that make it our war, for 
all that counts? Ours will be the 
victory ... but that means to me 
that what 6nngs victory, the incin- 
erated trees, the ashen villages, the 
bloody bark trophies our allies are 
taking out there in the jungle, those 
are all ours too. /ndde/im//y,l thought 
<dl the natives resented ‘YipYap’ as a 
name for their world.” 

“Please,” he said. “That ‘YipYap’ 
just slipped out. We don’t call it that, 
except in the kind of jest 1 tried 
to make just then. You’re very literal, 
I see. No, we call it what Groendyk 
called it when he set his scout down 
here. To those of us who are on 
it, B44(3) is La Selva — The Jun- 
gle. 

“Excuse me. Miss Harker. Arthur 
has finished his apple and is anxious 
for me to leave so he can cmy out 
his nightly marauding against the 
paste and paper supply. 1 could use 
a drink myself, and a little dinner. 

“The head of an advisory com- 
mission to Yip Sing is the loneliest 
man on the planet. Would you let 
me take you to your hotel and buy 
you dinner first?” 

n 

T hey fell into step down the dark- 
ened hall. Arther’s bayberry 
scent following them. As they neared 
the front end of a minor maze of 
corridors, the night attendant slither- 
ed toward them. It was a dendroid of 



48 



IF 




moderate age, about as tall as a kum- 
quat tree, its bole already thickening 
to the diameter of a thirty-ycar-old 
ash, with the mantle atop its mush- 
rooming **head” obsequiously rippling. 
In near falsetto tones, which sounded 
to Har-Gret Barker like a bad joke, 
the creature announced, “SirsI 
MadamsI Fellers! Me door. Me door. 
Thissy, thatsy, outsy door! Me door, 
me door, all.” 

“How do you know that’s a Yip 
and not a Yap?” she asked the gen- 
eral in a low voice. 

“Oh, easy,” he said. “Come over 
here in the light, and I’ll show you.” 
They stopped near a dull globe 
which hardly dispelled the gloom, and 
he summoned the plant-animal. 
“Hey, Yip! Come on over here. 
Ripple your mantle for the lady. 
Now, look, Har-Gret, you can see 
the base of the opening in the mantle 
— the slit extends all the way round 
his ‘head’ — and the base, around 
where the sex nodules are, has a 
faintly greenish purple cast. The Yaps 
are the other way around. The moist 
membrane around the sex pearls is 
purplish green.” 

Har-Gret Harker shrugged. In the 
dim yellowish light, she could hard- 
ly see any color on the moist surface, 
which exuded a musky odor like that 
of a long-empty perfume bottle. The 
general chuckled. “You’re looking 
too close. To see the color tone, 
you’ve got to scan. Come on. Yip, 
raise your whole flaming mantle and 
spin around for us.” Silently, the 
short, thick tree complied. General 
Traven’s face fell. “Hagan o Hagan! 

I made a mistake. Miss Harker, I’m 
sorry!” 



She stepped back in apprehension* 
“It’s a Yap? Is it dangerous? What 
can it do, at this range?” She re^h- 
ed for the blaster which the issumg 
sergeant had promised her she would 
never have to use. 

“No, no . oh, I . no, for 
Selva’s sake, don’t let fly with Bad 
cannon in here! It’s one of ours. Only 
it isn’t a Yip. She’s a Yipper — a 
lady. Blast it, I forgot to ask the 
ritual question. The males, the Yips, 
have a hundred of those pearly lott- 
ing nodules, and the Yippers have 
only ninety-seven. When you see the 
whole circle, it’s easy to see whether 
they’re in five even groups of twenty, 
or in four of twenty and one of 
seventeen. But you’re supposed to 
ask. Then you don’t look. See? This 
one is a Yipper.” 

“I Yipper yes,” the tree said dream- 
ily. 

“So?” said Har-Gret Harker. She 
couldn’t* believe that this casual faux 
pas had embarrassed the general as 
much as appeared from his sheepish 
face. 

“Wen, I — O Hagan, it’s nothing. 
We’ll get it over right away ... the 
fact is that now wc’vc looked at her, 
she has the right to look at us. 
Local culture pattern, you know.” 
As Har-Gret stepped back farther 
into the gloom, Traven said, “Ifs 
just the most casual inspection, real- 
ly. Really. It’s sort of like having an 
oak drop an acorn in your cleavage. 

I am sorry. It’s just the way the 
fix fax.” 

H ar-Gret Harker laughed angrily 
when she heard the punch fine 
of earth’s most popular tv comic re- 



THE GUERRILLA TREES

peated again^ as she had heard it a 
hundred times in the day she had 
been on B44(3), as insincere apology 
for small irritations and as a put-off 
for embarrassing questions. “Shall we 
strip? What is this tomfoolery?” She 
felt certain she had not been stirred 
alone, in the general’s office. She 
was seldom mistaken about such 
things; but if the general turned out 
to be a looker instead of a doer, 
she knew she would simply turn the 
reaction off. 

“Please, Miss Harker,” he said, 
still smiling one-sidedly, “I don’t want 
to be uncomplimentary; but I should 
certainly not have chosen this dark 
and uncomfortable hallway as a place 
in which to match orbits by some ela- 
borate joke. We have to override 
some of the Yipsl culture to get them 
to save themselves, so we have to 
give in on non-essentials. We needn’t 
watch each other. Come, look: we’ll 
stands side by side. Just palm open 
your coverall and pull down your 
... ah, your briefs . and I’ll do 
the same . and that’s really all 
there is to it. Then I’ll take you to 
dinner and drop you at your hotel.” 

Half-frowning and half-smiling, 
she came forward into the partial 
light and did as he suggested. Al- 
though he had said that they need not 
look at each other, she did not deny 
herself a peripheral glance. Yipper’s 
examination was more tactile than 
visual, and it was very short and gen- 
tle. “You he. You she. I Yipper,” 
the short tree murmured, waving its 
myriad twigs, and proudly tripped 
the door. 

Drinks and dinner were constrain- 
ed until, as if by mutual consent, 

.50 



the war and the minor inconvenience 
it had just visited on them were put 
aside for a pleasant, inconsequential 
chat about home. There was no other 
contretemps until the cab pulled up 
in front of her hotel. There was no 
telling what its name had been when 
it was a second-rate inn for traveling 
trees; but the correspondents who had 
been assigned there by (they were 
all sure) a malign billeting sergeant, 
had renamed it Timber Arms. The 
name was boldly painted on a great 
strip of peeled Yap hide. 

“In Ae name of the great Melt,” 
General Traven burst out, “who stuck 
you in this tree-house? You’ll have to 
let me billet you someplace decent, 
Harker. I could drop you at the Diplo- 
matic Barracks tonight, and tomorrow 
you can be in the Hilton Selva.” 
“No, Traven,” she refused. “Hag- 
gle Harker isn’t asking any favors of 
general officers, or anybody else. If 
you knew how I fought to get out 
here, you’d understand why I don’t 
want anything that even looks as if I 
complained about one single item of 
the environment while Fm taping this 
story. Anyway, the place is clean, and 
it’s safe enough. It’s full of news- 
tapers.” 

44^T^hat gang! We call them the 
JL pulque news pool. They sit 
around all day lapping fermented 
tree sap, and at night the one who 
drew the short straw in the morning 
comes back and every drunk in the 
bunch tapes a story off him.” 

“Well, that’ll make it easier for me 
to beat them. Now, don’t worry about 
me. Just worry about what Fm going 
to write when I get back to earth.” 



IF 




He laughed. “We do censor every- 
thmg» you know. This is a combat 
zone, even if it’s not a war.” 

“It’s a war, as far as I’m concern^ 
ed. Remember 1 said, ‘When 1 get 
back to earth.’ You can’t censor the 
inside of my skull.” 

“That’s the way the fix fax,” he 
replied. “Listen, Har-Gret, I’d offer 
to put you up — my billet is forty 
rooms, a whole Hagan of a lot better 
then I could afford on earth; but it’s 
. oh, I . .” 

“It’s too soon. I agree,” and die 
slid out of the cab. “Tha^. I hope 
I can see you again after I’ve been 
out in the field.” She waved as the 
cab was warped away by a native 
driver who looked like a cedar tree 
from Carmel. 

Jack-Jack Frens, with whom Har- 
Gret Harker had taped a police run 
when they were both learning their 
craft, woke her the next morning 
pounding on the door and shouting, 
‘^Haggiel Haggiel the war’s over! 
You came out here for nothing!” 
\Vhen she jerked open the irregularly 
shaped door of her room, he bound* 
ed in and embraced her. “Oh, Hag, 
you don’t know how good it is to see 
a real woman after a year of these 
creepy trees. Would you be interested 
in a short-term companionship, just 
for the duration?” 

“You tapestealer,” she greeted him 
affectionately. “1 wouldn’t companion 
with you again on a bet. Snoring in 
bed in one thing, but that’s a May-» 
high converter you operate when you 
get to sleep.” 

“That’s why you can’t find a per- 
manent union. Too choosy. Listen, 
the pulque pool has elected you to do 



all the work for the whole gang for 
a week. You’ve got the fresh view. 
It’ll earn us all a bonus.” 

“How the Hagan did you even 
know I was here?” 

Jack-Jack laughed. “The concierge 
told us.” 

“You mean this old owl roost has 
a factotum?” 

He opened the door and made a 
high, shrill noise. A sapling-slender 
figure rushed in and bent digihtly in 
a parody of respect. In falsetto, it 
piped, “Honored lady, I your dave. 
What can you wanted in tl^ morning? 
Hot water, cold water, d^bked cof- 
fee? Did I scrub your back?” 

Haggle laughed. “You’re a young 
Yip, right?” 

“No, honored lady. I Yipper. 
Your slave.” 

“Do you work for the hotel?” 

“No, no, I free enterpriser. My 
grove burn early in war, 1 only I 
alone alive to told. Newstapers adopt 
me. 1 smarter than roach, spe^ 
Terran like politician, sleep under 
stairs . .” 

“Jack-Jack,” Har-Gret said, “you 
colonial exploiter, you never land any- 
where without taking on a serf. 
Honey,” to the little tree, “do these 
tight fisted drunks pay you any- 
thing?” 

“Pay?” the little creature said, its 
two bulbous eyes on the front dope 
of the upper mantle dive with inter- 
est. “What pay meafa?” 

H ar-Gret struck Frens several 
times with the edge of her hand. 
He laughed and pai^j^ the karate 
blows with his foreanns. “Wait a 
minute. Haggle. She may not know

the wor4, hut we take care of her, 
and she takes care of us. She has 
food, some money, speaks the best 
Terran of any tree on the planet • . • 
and has the best nose for news. Har- 
Gret, if you hit me again. I’ll kick 
you in the belly.” He raised one com- 
bat boot. 

“Oh, you’re hopeless. Get out of 
here.” She pushed him out the door. 
“Now, young lady,” and she led the 
slim Yipper to ha bed, “you know 
1 don’t know much about you and 
your world. You’ll have to teach me. 
Do you sit down?” 

“Oh, sure, lady,” Yipper said, 
matching action to word and cross- 
ing the two separate lower portions 
of her trunk at what would have been 
the ankles if she had been a fourteen- 
year-old girl. “Lie down too. You 
want? Terrans most want that late by 
night. Now?” 

“Great Melt!” said Har-Gret. “You 
poor child. How old are you?” 

“I three next eigjit day.” 

“Melt! You’re a diild. Listen, how 
old is one of you with a girth like 
this?” She he^ out her hands to 
indicate the size of the Yipper she 
had encountered in Traven^s HQ. 

“Oh, ten years, fifty years. Grow 
slow after fifty. Much tall by hundred 
fifty, some thicker. lie down now?” 
and she rippkd her mantle for a 
length of about dghteen inches. 

Haggle Halter was both amused 
and disgusted. How does one deal 
with a child whore whose most se- 
ductive feature is a mushroom head 
like a Tennid drawing? “listen, 
baby,” she said. “I’m a different sex 
from these other newstapers. You 
understand sex? My ... my require- 



ments are different from theirs.” 
“Lady!” Yipper said. “I know sex. 
We two sexes too. How were you 
thought ... we scatter seeds on wind 
or something? Did you show me?” 
Did you show me, Har-Gret 
thought. If you can comprehend sex, 
why not tense? “Well, I ... oh, 
Hagan, what in the melting planets’ 
difference can it make? 1 show you 
and you show me, right? And I’ll 
teach you Terran on a little more 
systematic basis. I’ll bet these tape 
rats have taught you a rare vocabu- 
lary, but we’il make a lady Yipper 
out of you yet. All right, Galatea: 
show me your equipment” 

III 

A n hour later, Har-Gret was a 
much enlightened Terran. The 
peculiarities of Yipsi metabolism 
which allowed them to put down 
roots when necessary, walk when 
wanted, masticate and digest meat, 
bones, vegetables, or anything else 
animate when available, liad been ex- 
plained to her in accented Terran 
which she was working to make more 
understandable even as she absorbed 
information from it. The exchange of 
information about parturition and 
the acts leading up to it had been 
fast and full, and the amount of 
voluntary control Yippers could ex- 
ert over their internal organization 
left Haggle Harker rather envious. 

A chance hint at the social organi- 
zation of the Yipsi soon led the con- 
versation away from biology. By 
noon, Har-Gret was still pulling in- 
formation out of her new found 
friend. Again and again the little 



52 



IP 




creature affirmed her undying at^ 
tadiment for Yip Sing; but when 
challenged to explain if this was a 
country^ a government, a political 
philosophy or a place, Yipper always 
produced a tortur^ formulation 
whidi Har-Gret had no trouble recog^ 
nizing as her friend’s translation of 
Terran communiques about the em- 
battled democratic Yip Sing villages. 

“Are there embattled democratic 
villages in Yap Sang too?” 

“No villages Yap Sang. Dirty 
Yaps huddle in groves. Wild, mean. 
Shed leaves.” 

“And do you shed your leaves?” 
“Only if I have leaves,” 

“Well,” Haggle said in exaspera- 
tion, “do the Yapsl shed leaves ex- 
cept when they have leaves?” 

“On orderl Master trees in Yap 
Sang wave branch, leaves fall. UghI 
Turn stomach to see.” 

“Why orders? What is the point 
of the different way of doing things?” 
‘^Master trees bosses. Down boss- 
es!” the little tree whistled. Hag- 
gle learned to recognize the eye roll 
with which the Yipper then looked 
to see if this was approved. 

“Honey,” she said, “Old Haggle 
doesn’t give a melted sun for all that 
poisoned fertilizer. Please, please, be- 
lieve me that 1 don’t care about the 
objectives of my government here. 
Just tell me: why should you hate 
Yapsl because they drop their leaves 
differently from you?’’ 

T he fourth or fifth time, Yipper 
suddenly began to leak green 
gray tears down her pretty bark, not 
only from her protruberant eyes, but 
from the slit which encircled her 



mantle. “Rootless . yoii rootlcssl” 
she cried. “Terrans burn my grove 
... all burned, nowhere but flame, 
only did to breathe bum kerosene. 
You mean Terran, smell from kero- 
sene, every all!” 

Har-Gret knew she was on to 
something. Emotion unlocks truth; 
and for the first time, she felt Yip- 
per was saying what she felt rather 
than what she thought Haggle want- 
ed to hear. Trained instinct drove the 
taper on. “What do you mean, burnt 
your grove? And I thought you lived 
in a village.” 

“Village, grove, hamlet, same 
same, MELT YOUR SUN!” The 
sapling Yipper was weak with hate 
and fright, dripping saphke tears, 
branches trembling. Suddenly she 
flung herself, backward on Haggle’s 
bed and shrieked, “Okay! Come on! 
Okay! Okay! This all any Terran 
want. Melt you! Melt you!” Great 
gray green tears stained the bedding. 

Har-Gret Harker sat on the edge 
of the rude bed and threw her arms 
about the fri^tened, hate-filled sap- 
ling. She gathered the little tree to 
her breast and rocked back and forth 
for a minute. “O Yipper, what can I 
say? What can I do? I don’t know 
the simplest gesture of tenderness 
among your people. Poor darling, this 
is the way we comfort children 
among my race, and you’re a child 
to me. I’m ten times as old as you, 
Yipper, think of that, ten times! I’m 
thirty, sweetheart, id you know 
that?” 

From the great mushroom head 
there came a giant cough. “You no 
thick in trunk. No thirty.” 

“Yes, darling, oh yes, yes I am. 



THE GUERRILLA TREES

I’m slender because 1 work at it, 
thank you; but we don’t all gel thick 
anyhow. There, can you sit up now? 
SbaD I wipe your tears a li^?” 
Yipper gave a great snuffling 
sound, and all the tears stiB on her 
tender bark disappeared into it “Well, 

I told you all 1 knew. 1 went to 
work now.” 

“Wait a minute, Yipper. Are we 
friends now? How do you say friends 
in your language?” 

Yipper stood silent. Har-Gret 
tried again. “No word for friends in 
your language?” 

Yipper gave an eloquent snort. 
“You not hear, not see. Our sounds 
too tall for you; and you no have 
twigs for the words which are see.” 
“You talk with your branches?” 
The dendroid made the sign which 
Har-Gret recognized now as a riirug. 
“AH right,” Haggie said. “I can’t hear 
you and I can’t see you except in my 
language. Friends t^k to each other, 
even if it’s hard. So speak Terran to 
me, and I promise to listen hard. 
Please tell me about your grove.” 

(( Tust mistake.” The great eye 
stalks filmed with green mois- 
ture. “Just . melted mistake. One 
tree like another to human beings, 
anyway. Every tree I love gone like 
torch. I and one Yipper left, too 
green to bum.” 

“Another beautiful little giri like 
you? What happened to her?’* 

“We come here together. Yipper 
will not lie down easy. She have 
leaves already, see. Soldiers tear off 
her bark and branches one mght, fuB 
of pM/qwe.” 

“They killed her?” 



“Lose bark, that kill her. Sapi 
out. 1 give bark, but too little to save 
her.” The small tree pointed to a 
hard brown scar cm one side. 
“Soldiers crazy on pn/qiie.” 

Har-Gret Haiker could bear to ask 
no more. She made an agreonent that 
Yipper would come bad: the next 
day, and then she dressed herself. 

An hour later, she began to doubt 
that it bad happened. StOl, it was all 
on the raw tape, to be wirmowed 
later for that would sock Haggie 
Harker’s special audience in the guts 
when the reels were edited. Doubt 
was fed by the careful, dieerfui brief- 
ing she was receiving from one of 
Travails aides. The first thing he had 
done was to ask her for a date. When 
she turned him down and told him 
she hoped to be in the )ungle that 
night, he paled visibly and hurried 
into the briefing. 

As the captain explained, it seem- 
ed perfectly dear to Har-^ret Hark- 
er that Yipsl could earily be distin- 
guished from Yapsl, that there was a 
real difrerence between the social or- 
ganization of the two, that the nor- 
thern Yipsl had a rccognizaWy “hu- 
mane” government and economic 
structure, that the southern Yapri 
were visiNy satellites ci the dreaded 
bacterial empire centered in BeteJ- 
geusc, that there was a human 
strategic interest of life-and-dcath na- 
ture on this little planet which com- 
manded a vastreach of space and was 
the only planet for parsecs in any 
direction habitable both by the bac- 
teria and human beings, and . what 
she bad most doubted, turning tapes 
on the movieola in her ofOce on earth 
. that Sd was slowly, painfully.

IF 




expensively^ but appreciably, winning 
the war by bringing immense tech- 
nology to bear, across the wide ocean 
of space. 

She thanked the aide, promised 
him that after what she had seen in 
his orientation movies of the stran- 
gling trees and the new poisons elabo- 
rated for them by their bacterial al- 
lies and masters in Betelgeuse, she 
would not venture into the night jun- 
gle where the Yapsl guerrilla trees 
hunted, and walked into the yellow 
afternoon sun with a feeling of bear- 
ings lost. 

Jack-Jack Frens may be a snaffler, 
she said to herself. In fact he u a 
snaffler, but he’s my snaffler. Borg 
Traven couldn’t sell Jack-Jack a safe 
conduct through the jungle, let alone 
a propaganda structure like this; and 
drunk, sober or hung over, Jack-Jack 
is people. So she went back to Tim- 
ber Arms, stood in the lobby and 
yelled, “Yipper!” When the sapling 
appeared. Haggle said shortly, “Get 
Jack-Jack Frens — quietly — and 
bring him up to my room. Savvy?” 

“Sure,” said Yipper. “You lie down 
with Jack-Jack?” 

Haggle grinned. “That’s too com- 
plicated for me to explain in pidgin 
Terran. Just hunt him up, will you? 
I trust you, Yipper. Here’s half-a- 
credit in advance; but 1 want him 
in a hurry.” 

“Sure,” said Yipper, “know that 
feeling,” and she went off, mantle 
rippling in a suggestive way. 

IV 

T^ive minutes later, Jack-Jack Frens 
1 / opened the door without knock- 



ing and sauntered in with a liter ofl 
ptdque in his fist “Yipper rousted 
me out of the bar. Haggle. The 
gang’s all there waiting for you to 
dictate their tapes; but 1 figured you 
either had a beat you needed help 
on, or you wanted my advice with- 
out advertising it.” 

“Jack square,” said Haggle, “put 
down that melt^ tree juice. I’ve got 
a liter and a half of Quid Kennedy 
Green Label in that bag over there. 
Pull out a can and pour us a couple 
of shots. I want some truth out of 
you.” 

“Harker the Hag!” he said, open- 
ing the door and setting the pulque 
jug on the floor in the hall. “You 
never forget you’re Ace Girl Reporter, 
do you? How’d you get clearance to 
bring out this much mass in liquid 
form?” 

“Lay off, Jackling. We were 
friends when we were companions, 
and we’re still friends, aren’t we?” 

The tall news-taper paused in his 
task of evening up the contents of 
two passes, looked levelly at her and 
said, without his usual smile, “Til 
the sim melts, Har-Gret. And to take 
you off the hook. I’ll tell you Chi-An 
Ling and 1 have already mailed the 
contracts. She’s my permanent union, 
as soon as I can get home from this 
crazy greenhouse to consummate it. 
Okay?” 

“Jack, I’m glad for Chi-An. I 
haven’t time for more congratula- 
tions. Have Chi-An let me know 
when the consummation party is.” 

“Why, Hag, you won’t be out of 
here by then. Aren’t you signed on 
for a Terran year, like all the rest 
of us?” 



THE GUERRILLA TREES 



55 




“Sure, but you get sent home by 
FTL capsule if it’s for the conveni- 
ence of the advisory commission; 
and it always is convenient for the 
commis^on if you’re critical.” 

H e handed her the drink. “Hag- 
gle, Hagan knows you’ve got 
chutzpah enough to try anything; 
but dear heart, what mostly happens 
to tapers out here who offend Borg 
Traven is that the bookerman carries 
them off in the night. He ^ips home 
mighty few; but lots of tapers have 
died heroic deaths, strangled or 
poisoned by the Yaps ... it says 
here.” 

She made a short raspberry and 
said, “Well, that’s the way the fix 
fax, Jax. Thanks for the warning, 
and no, thanks. Give me what you 
know, and I’ll burn the tape from 
here to Terra. I don’t want your own 
stuff . just the background it 
takes a year to get But Til be look- 
ing at it without a year of drinking 
pulque and listening to Captain 
Stinks of the Horse Marines, that 
melting p.r. officer . yes, and 
without a year of lying down with 
underage trees.” 

He colored, and laughed uneasily. 
“Oh, well, come on, Har-Gret, a man 
is not made of wood.” He giggled 
and said, “Well, I guess that’s an un- 
fortunate way to put it Sha Hagan! 
Leave my sex life out of this. It was 
no concern of yours the day you 
packed your ear plugs and left.” 

She laughed explosively. “Chi-An 
Ling! She’s got more sensitive ears 
than L We were a four once, and I 
remember. Chi-An was the one who 
slept down the hall, while the other 



three of us sawed wood at each 
Other.” 

Jack looked uncomfortable. “WeD, 
one clause of the contract is that I’ll 
have my septum relocated jmd my 
soft palate plasticized. What in Selva’s 
name do you want from me?” 
“What’s all this tree-sweat about 
villages and groves?” 

“Look, Hag, it’s just that earth 
people can visualize a village as being 
on our side a lot carier than a grove; 
and they don’t think of a bombed 
grove or a burned grove as having 
people in it — as being people; so 
we call them Yipsl villages and Yap 
groves. Who cares how many Yap 
groves we incinerate?” 

He drank deep. “Har-Gret, we’re 
destroying the ecology of the planet. 
When we win ... of course, we 
will win, technology always wins . 
there won’t be any planet left . 
not for these people. It’ll stiH be here 
for us, and we will have denied it to 
the bacteria. But Yips? No, sweet- 
heart, no Yip Sing, no Yap Sang, 
not a talking tree left in the universe. 
That’s going to be our victory. I’m 
sorry you only got a liter and a half 
of this corn whisky. I’d like, just one 
night, to get plastered enough not to 
remember all those dendroids out 
there, burning and strangling. You 
brought my favorite brand. I’ll say 
that. Did you- remember I used to 
drink it before it was advertised?” 

“I brought it because I learned to 
like it from you. Is there any real 
difference between Yips and Yap^?” 

H e took a long pull of the hun- 
dred-proof rocket fuel her influ- 
ence had brought to La Selva. Then 



56 



IF 





he sighed. “Got any Japanese friends, 
Haggie?” 

“Sure. You remember that fat 
Sumo wrestler we used to follow. 
After you and I split, I spent a 
summer with his entourage. His wife 
was tiny, like Chi-An. His brother 
was two meters tall, without an ounce 
of fat on him. That what you mean?” 

“Exactly. They look different, but 
all regard themselves as Japanese. Any 
difference between them as individuals 
is a difference in philosophy or edu- 
cation or politics. You can’t see that 
Jn the shape of a head or the measure- 

THE GUERRILLA TREES 




ment from the floor to the top knot.” 
“You’re telling me the difference 
here is a political difference.” 
Jack-Jack shook his head. “I don’t 
think I am, am I? I didn’t mean to.” 
“All right, Jack square, what do 
you mean?” 

He drained the glass and poured 
another. “I mean the difference is 
whether they live in the southern 
hemisphere, where the forests are in- 
fected by the bacteria, or in the 
northern hemisphere, which we infest. 
And that’s the only difference,” 
“Jack,” she said. “Stop drinking 
for one melted minute. You are say- 
ing that we are destroying a whole 
species because of our struggle against 
the bacteria?” 

“Ye-a-ess.” 

“No other reason?” 

“None.” 

“The southern aggression?” she 
asked wistfully. 

“Hagan o Hagan! The planet’s 
tilted, like home! What Groendyk saw 
was the spring renascence in the 
south and the autumn leaves falling 
in the north. The bacteria were in 
the south already. They would have 
appeared in the north in its next 
spring; so we moved in there in the 
dead of winter . and claimed the 
green spring as a great opening vic- 
tory for our technology.” 

“What about the democratic vil- 
lages of the north?” 

“’Sno villages,” Frens spoke 
thickly, tears in his eyes. “Only 
grovesy north and south. True trees 
in groves, and at the center of every 
grove a family of those dendroids. 
They live with the trees, grow with 
them, protect them, cultivate them. 



Some grovesh’re hunnert milez acrosh. 
In the middle of a forest like that, 
there may be three or four Yips a 
hunnert’n’fif y feet tall, and one ole 
gran’pappy two hunnert feet high. 
That’s all. No villages, no govern- 
ment, no votes, no historic democra- 
tic tradition, nothing; just the trees 
and the den^oids.” 

“Then what in Selva’s name are we 
doing here?” 

“Good strategic reason. B44(3) is 
the command planet for one enor- 
mous globe of q>ace. We can live 
here, and the bacteria can live here. 
Not another planet with the right 
specs for a third of a spiral arm. So 
it’s us or them . but, baby, it’s tough 
on trees.” 

Jack-Jack drained another gjass of 
the Green Label and lay back across 
the bed. “This short-out juice is gon- 
na cut off my computer in a few 
more minutes. Hag. If I get sick, jush 
drag me in and prop my head over 
the disposal unit. Hell of a war.” 
Har-Gret said, “I may be there 
ahead of you. Cold strategy makes a 
cold supper, Jacko. Not one human 
idea in the whole lash-up, except that 
it’s us or the bugs . and melt the 
Yips. Hard times on YipYap.” 

V 

N ext morning, predictably. Haggle 
Harker was hung over, a con- 
dition which always presaged a hard 
time for the object of her researches. 
She had Yipper drag Jack-Jack Frens 
off to his own cubicle in the early 
dawn. He was so hung that working 
it off was out of the question. He 
would do well to sleep it off in a 



58 



IF 




single day. Har-Gret showered 
angrily and ^ot into her coverall. 
She was in line for a tour of govern- 
ment bureaus that mc»mmg, meeting 
the local administrators who held Yip 
Talltree’s writ; but llaggie wanted to 
get out of the Sodom she felt the 
city now to be. She wanted to see 
what Terran boys were being trans- 
lated out to La Selva by FTL cap- 
sule to do. She was honest ^ough 
with herself to know that there was 
some point at which she would feel 
that the destiny of the dendroids 
didn’t matter, some point at which 
the survival of her own branch of 
the human race would be sufficient- 
ly* important After all, they were the 
bearers of the democratic tradition, 
though its present computerized, 
totally industrialized form might seem 
strange to Jefferson or Danton. Then 
she would shrug and say, “That’s the 
way the fix fax,” and mean it. 

If justice and human compassion 
were scheduled to die throughout the 
galaxy, but that death could be fore- 
stalled by the sacrifice of one small 
planet. Haggle Marker would press 
the button, conceding the injustice 
of that planet’s having been chosen 
by hers to do all the dying for both. 
But pressing one button, the dassic 
choice of the philosophers, was dif- 
ferent from being asked to affirm and 
approve an endless series of green tree 
burnings and flooding out of forests 
old enough to support creatures like 
Yipper, but a hundred feet tall. Sav- 
ing one’s own world and way of life 
somehow failed to justify the casual 
cruelty of painting a hotel name 
on the stripped skin of a dead den- 
droid. 



So the time had come for Haggie 
to satisfy herself as to the actual con- 
tent of the war. There was no front, 
only “(^rations”; and it was fuQy 
fifteen minutes before Haggie Marker 
was recognized by two bug sergeants 
and, wb^ she confessed ^e wanted 
to see a combat sweep without the 
clearance of the top deckers, 
smug^d onto the flame deck of a 
jumper. 

An hour later, the “boys” — and 
they were boys> that was the Hagan 
of it — were gleefully pouring the 
undying lire into the heart of a 
grove so massive and so old that it 
seemed like a green mountain. 
Around the flickering edges of the 
flame, the darker flickering of fleeing 
bacteria could be seen, bursting into 
corona-hke arms visible throu^ the 
fhewatching goggles the young Ter- 
rans had lent the famous news-taper. 

(4*0 urn those bugs!” the young 

•13 men shouted, while the range 
finder monotonously ordered the fire 
to be spread, repeating again and 
again, “Bacteria moving out north by 
west . one mile west . flames 
one hi^, two high, and spread ...” 

Meanwhile one of the bug sergeants 
was explaining. “The whole base of 
this flitter craft is sensitized to the 
presence of bacteria in any significant 
concentration. We’ve had our eye on 
this patch of forest for about a week. 
It’s a main stop on the infection 
route, and they’re probably dug in 
fifty meters below the roots of those 
innocent-lookiDg trees. That’s why 
we can’t let the fire die. It has to 
keep burning until there isn’t a living 
thing here. Then we consider that 



THE GUERRILLA TREES 



59 




we already have secured the grove.” 
“But there’s no grove left. When 
dcfes it grow back?” 

“I don’t know. Haggle. I just work 
here. You know what I mean: they 
don’t tell us that; but some of the 
ecology boys say it may be a hundred 
YipYap years.” 

“Do they fight back?” 

“Well, no, the trees can’t do much, 
at this distance. The big dendroids 
snap those long tentacles like cata- 
pults, and sometimes they can throw 
a load of bacteria near enough to do 
some damage. We’ve lost three-four 
thousand men that way.” 

“I thought our technical superi- 
ority was such that no Terrans were 
being lost in combat.” 

The sergeant looked at her. He 
was a professional, and he would be 
here after the draft of boys he was 
running on this sweep were home or 
dead. His look was the weary, cynical 
one with which the combat man has 
always regarded home front propa- 
ganda. 

“But surely the greatest number of 
losses is from sabotage and from the 
guerrilla trees?” 

“Oh, sure. When you walk out of 
a saloon with a tree tart on your arm 
and a tentacle drops around your neck 
or poison sap spews in your eyes, it’s 
a bad war. Ma’am.” 

J ust then Haggle got a better dem- 
onstration than she ever wanted 
to remember of the fighting capa- 
bilities of the tall dendroids. There 
suddenly appeared at an open gunport 
a fuzzy black cloud which sucked it- 
self into the jumper even as Haggle 
was screaming and pointing. Nothing 



she had ever seen on her colleagues* 
tapes made her realize that the bac- 
teria were intelligent more than the 
deadly way in which the little cloud 
oriented itself, shot like an arrow to 
the guidance controller and killed him 
with a fulminating infection that 
struck so fast he never cried out. 

As the ship automatically began to 
sink toward the forest, the dead man 
turned black. Clouds of black erupt- 
ed from every orifice of his body, 
each headed for a different member 
of the crew. A black blister made un- 
erringly down the dead controller’s 
umbilical cord to the organic gui- 
dance mechanism, and killed it. The 
noise of propulsion died; the roaring 
flame nipples blew out; the only 
noises in the vessel were people whim- 
pering with haste to get their bug- 
proofs on, and the rush of air as the 
ship fell more and more headlong. 

From outside and below came the 
sound Har-Gret Harker could never 
forget. The burning trees were 
screaming. 

It was that agony of noise she 
remembered, retching and crying in 
the rescue boat that had swung over 
them and taken off the few survivors. 

W hen she faced Borg Traven the 
next day. Haggle Harker knew 
her face had wrinkles she would never 
be able to iron out. “General,” she 
said, in the tone news-tapers adopt 
when they expect to be lied to, but 
have to ask a question for the record, 
“what justification can there be for 
the suffering we are causing to the 
trees and dendroids of this world? 
Surely there is some strategic objec- 
tive to be gained short of a world 



60 



IF 




of ashes. Even if we were justified 
in destroying a whole unique species 
because of our own danger, can we 
justify doing it with flame-jumpers?” 

Borg Traven sat completely immo- 
bile for a moment. Then he passed 
a great hand over bis face, and the 
face that emerged from that message 
was infinitely sad. “We explain what 
we do by the necessity of our own 
lives, if the trees would only throw 
off the infection and stop resisting 
long enough for us to begin rebuild- 
ing what we have destroyed, we 
would leave this a garden world, 
with only a few strategic enclaves to 
assure the bacteria could not intiltrate 
without our knowing in time to fight 
them off. 

“I don’t condone brutality, and I 
don’t enjoy the spectacle of Terran 
boys pulling the bark off tied down 
trees and enjoying it. I know how 
they feel, though. When you’ve got to 
get irrformation and you’re dealing 
with organisms that are resistant to 
questioning drugs, you’ve got to be 
awfully patient and tolerant not to feel 
that torture is a justified shortcut. 
Boys who*ve seen their friends 
strangled and poisoned and blinded 
right here in town by killer trees 
that just slip into the forest, sink their 
roots in the soil and become indistin- 
guishable from the rest of the jrfants 
can’t be expected to be as tolerant 
and patient as you and I are. 

“One last thing: don’t forget that 
the technique of bark stripping was 
taught us by the dendroids. They 
practice it on each other.” 

‘Tve heard about that. They girdle 
a dendroid that’s invaded territory be- 
longing to another grove, blind him 

THE GUERRILLA TREES 



and point him for home as a lesson 
to the others in his grove. It’s some- 
thing they’ve been doing for thou- ^ 
sands of years. Bark stripping is a 
part of their culture, and an u^y 
part; but at least ifs isolated, it has ^ 
some relation to what are valid cul- 
tural goals for them. Ifs bestiality 
for us. We institutionaliTO sadism 
when we let it happen. We’re sup- 
posed to be the most advanced tech- 
nological planet in the galaxy. Is the 
best technique for questioning prison- 
ers that we can come up vnSi a par- 
ticularly unrefined brand of torture?” 

The general looked strai^t at her, 
agony in his eyes. “Is that the thing 
that most worries and frig^ens you? 
Not me. At least when yorfre tortur- 
ing some creature, you have a re- 
lationship with it, however twisted. 
What sickens me is the genocide we’re 
working on the whole planet. We’ve 
killed enough trees already to alter 
the ecology of the jtenet Ifs be- 
coming gr^ually less desirable and 
more expensive for the bacteria to 
maintain their infection outposts; but 
we’re doing it by using the first tech- 
nical discovery man ever made — 
fire. Did you hear any trees scream- 
ing when yon were falling into that 
burnout yesterday?” 

“Yes,” she said, pressing her hands 
to her eyes. Somehow, if she could 
erase the image of miles of green 
trees in unnatural flame, she could 
get the dreadful sound out of her 
ears. 

“All rightr* General Traven 
said, leaning forward and grasping 
both her wrists so he could pull her 
hands away from her eyes. “You got 
yourself into that before you were 

61 




ready for it. I can’t protect you from 
youraelf. 1 have no illusions about 
that. No general can restrain a news- 
taper who knows half his non-coms 
from a dozen other brushfire wars. 
You can go anywhere and see any- 
thing you want to. The only way I 
could stop you would be to shove 
you in an FTL capsule and zeep 
you back to earth; and I’d be dead 
on every news-tape in the galaxy if I 
did. But Har-Gret, this is an ugly 
green world out here. Will you just 
let me control your time for the next 
two days? I promise you’ll be briefed 
on some items the pulque pool 
doesn’t even know exist. At the end 
of that time, the world is yours; or 
the Yip Sing part, anyway. How 
about it?” 

She nodded with tears glittering 
on her eyelids. 

“Now,” he said, I’ve got to get 
you out of this office. Or I never 
will.” And he smiled a real smile. 

VI 

T he p.r. captain’s eyes opened 
when General Traven described 
the briefing to be given Har-Gret 
Marker on the new technlogy about 
to come into play in the war. Borg 
Traven’s orders were certainly not to 
be questioned by any creature as low 
as a captain, however, and the news- 
taper soon found herself talking to 
lab men and technicians who had 
been FTL-zeeped out to get the 
new weaponry into action. 

“Actually,” one of them said in the 
accents of Old Oxford, “we shall give 
up doing anything to the trees as 
groups and groves. We are going to 



reduce General Traven’s war to a 
man-to-man, or 1 suppose 1 should 
say, man-to-dendroid combat. We 
have a new filter — there, slip that 
over your head — that’s good for a 
hundred hours against even the den- 
sest swarm of bacteria. The soldier 
will be equipped with a personal 
flitter — oh, you’re familiar with 
them? One forgets you’ve just come 
out, yourself — with which he can 
escape from a strangler tree. The 
head filter ought to hold off the 
poisons as well as the bacteria. The 
offensive weapon is this little aerosol 
pistol. See? The sidepack carries 
forty recharges, and we figure the 
whole thing is good for eighty den- 
droids, given optimum conditions.” 
“What does it do?” 

“Why, Miss Marker, it’s a rapid 
rot agent. Beauty is it only gets the 
dendroid, or the one or two trees in 
a small grove that have been in- 
fected by the bacteria. You know, 
it’s harshly hard work for the buw 
to infect trees — real wooden trew, 
I mean. The metabolism of the den- 
droids is such that it’s much easier; 
but the bugs can’t afford to reduce 
all the dendroids on the planet to 
acute illness. Then they’d have no- 
body to run the place for them, col- 
lect their space tolls, conduct lim- 
ited negotiations with us and all that. 
When we get these into full produc- 
tion and front-line use, the action 
will take a dramatic change.” 

“We’ll be burning them one at a 
time instead of in groves?” 

T he Oxonian mustache twitched a 
little. “Ye-es, you could say that. 
Rotting is a slow sort of bum. And

IF 




since this takes place in twenty-four 
to tiiirty-six hours, you might say 
that Stfl], it’s rather more humane 
than a burnout, where a whole grove, 
seedlings, saplings, tall trees and all 
gets reduced to ash. Don’t you 
think?” 

“Oh yes,” Haggle replied. “Does 
it reduce the one creature that’s been 
sprayed to a pile of smoking ash? As 
an example to the rest of the com- 
munity, that sort of thing?” 

“Miss Harker, I have the feeling 
you’re pulling my mustache. Don’t 
you want to deny this planet to the 
bugs?” 

“Hagan o Hagan! How many 
ritual obeisances do you people 
want? Of course I want this planet 
and the whole universe bacteria 
clean. I just don’t want every other 
animate, intelligent creature in the 
galaxy ganging up on us because 
we’re as bad as the bugs. Do I have 
to can General Traven to get a 
straight answer to my question? What 
is the actual physiological effect of 
this stuff on the particular dendroid 
sprayed with it? Is he reduced to 
ash?” 

“N-no, not — not quite. It’s a 
rapid rot, but the net effect is just 
that of a very old, hdlow tree. The 
wood goes, and the bark becomes 
porous and crumbly, gilows in the 
dark, you know. Everything decays 
except those thomylike things around 
the trunk near the ‘head’ — haven’t 
you noticed them?” 

“Yes,” Haggle said, “but I 
shouldn’t call them thorns. Not like 
rose thorns or even cactus thorns. 
They’re soft spines, like on a young 
citrus tree; even the points are soft.” 

THE GUERRILLA TREES 



“Well, something in this stuff 
stimulates the growth center for those 
organs — if that’s what they are; ap- 
pendages I suppose would be a better 
term. They become about a foot and 
a half long and extremely hard. About 
the consistency of good teak or heavy 
mahogany, I should say. The thorns 
are really all that’s left.” 

“Here’s the important question,” 
Haggle said. “When do we get enou^ 
of this stuff to make the difference 
in the character of the war and to 
start winning it?” 

“Oh, we’re winning it now. Miss 
Harker. The flit-flamers, the defdi- 
ants, the water-firing rifles that burst 
the whole inside of a tree out, these 
devices are carrying the war to vic- 
tory, as a war. They’re too effective. 
Have you seen them in action?” 

“I helped kill a whole grove thirty 
miles acro§s with them,” Har-Grct 
Harker said through gritted teeth. ‘Tf 
they finally come through with long- 
life pills and I live to be a thousand, 
maybe I’ll forget it. You’re haahup 
right they’re too effective.” 

T he technical man colored. 

“Hashly, if you don’t mind, 
Miss Harker. Hashup was an ob- 
scenity at my school.” 

“Melt your sun! And your hashed- 
up school too. Can’t you give me one 
straight answer, without simpering? 
When? When will we win this war 
by technology, instead of just 
slaughtering a world ... by tech- 
nology?” 

“Doctor Xylophage ... do you 
know of him? A Venusian, you 
know. Personally, I .find him a let 
more repulsive than a nice, clean, 

ea 




well mannered dendroid with sense 
enough to keep the dirt off its roots 
in a house. But it takes all sorts of 
efforts in a war. Doctor Xylophage» 
who invented the rotting agent, says 
that we ought to have the kinks out 
of the weaponry in another year. Say 
a year more to get it all in the pipe- 
line, and the war should be over in 
three years at most. 

“You see, the great thing is the 
dendroids won’t be able to resist this. 
They don’t have weapons in any con- 
ventional sense. Strangling with ten- 
tacles is something they’re physically 
adapted for; and poisoning by ex- 
creting liquids through their roots is 
something they’ve been doing to con- 
trol the breeding of the true trees for 
hundreds of thousands of years. But 
they have no technology, as we un- 
derstand the term. No machines, no 
metal. When they had this world all 
to themselves, it was a gigantic green- 
house, and even the tenders of the 
plants had become treelike: the den- 
droids. 

“When we get the delivery sys- 
tem elaborated, every human being 
on the planet will wear the filters 
whenever he’s out of doors. There 
won’t be any night patrols. A few 
months, really, free of strangling and 
poisoning, rotting down the leaders 
of the Yap infiltration from the 
south, and we’ll have B44(3) but- 
toned down like Kew Gardens.” 

“Three years! Three yearsV* Des- 
pite the hardening she had endured 
in a dozen ugly, necessary human 
actions she had reported on planets 
across the Terran side of the galaxy, 
there was something basically anti- 
human in the thought of continuing 



the burning and destruction of the 
groves for two or three more years 
that sickened and horrified Har-Gret 
Harker. 

She fled from the technical brief- 
ing, convinced beyond doubt that 
es^ would win by the shaped and 
directed power of its industry and the 
gadgeteers who had never failed to 
find better — deadlier — methods 
of disposing of earth’s enemies and 
of neutrals whose neutrality partook 
of enmity, but also convinced that 
the history of the reduction of La 
Selva would be remembered in every 
un-human planet in the galaxy and 
that earth would never again be 
trusted. Cultures who had never 
known the genuine blessings of com- 
puterization could be forgiven if they 
did not embrace it at once. To such 
a culture, even the deadening influ- 
ence of the bacteria, who infected a 
world by controlling its every leader 
in a state of chronic illness, might 
seem preferable. 

The worst thing for Haggle Hark- 
er was that she knew she and she 
alone, at this stage, could put the 
whole dreadful story on tape. And she 
knew she had to. It was too late for 
her to root out the motivations that 
had become part of her character 
along with the hardening in the wars 
she had reported. 

Tell all, tell true, was her motto. 
She could not renounce it. Not now. 
Not ever. 

VII 

I n a visible, seething rage, she went 
back to Timber Arms. In her 
room, she slammed and locked the 



64 



IF 




iU-£ittmg door. For a few minutes^ 
she sank on the bed, crying. Then 
she stood up and headed for the 
mirror cubicle to repair the ravages 
of her tears. She ghnced once around 
the room and slammed the door to 
the mirror cubicle. The metal pow- 
der and rouge case she tried to open 
resisted her fumbling fingers, and 
winding up like the legendary Don 
Wilson, she threw it to the floor. 
The silver object bounced three feet 
high, and as it came to rest with a 
rattle, a tiny voice was heard issuing 
from the bottom of it. *That you. 
Haggler 

‘Tes,” she hissed, squatting on her 
heels. **Sam, open me up a whole 
tape bank. I want one solid hour on 
tonight’s reeL You’ve got the stuff on 
the flame treatments we’ve been 
holding because the administration 
says they’re Yap propaganda. Sam, I 
was there. I helped bum a thirty- 
mile grove, and Sam, I heard them. 
Some of it’s on the tape bank here 
in my room. You just run that video 
we’ve been holding behind my audio, 
and we’ll bum a few woodenheads 
of our own.” 

The compact answered, ”Can’t to- 
night, baby. Draft riot in New Chica- 
go, and the Administrative Chairman 
himself is out there, showing the local 
love-chiefs how to push buttons. 
We’re covering it live. Yours will 
have aH the more carombof when we 
run it tomorrow night, right after the 
Ad Chair closes his press conference 
with an assurance that everything is 
all ri^t, everything is necessary, and 
anyway, weYe winning the good fight. 
Comfortable, kid? Lie down or sit 
down and cEcfate.” 



T wo hours later, she was beat» 
drained, and shivering from the 
reaction to high-speed orgaidzati« 
of the material in her head and on 
her tongue. The little transmittef, 
which tapped the galactic flow in 
the same way the FTL capsules ^d, 
hut which had not yet been thought 
about in the admhnstration’^s labfl^ 
was the secret weapon with winch 
Haggle Barker had come to La 
Selva inrepared to topple a militaiy 
public relations machine which seem- 
ed to brainwash news-tapers. Sam 
Smackover, her editor, had said, 
"Haggle, we believe in machines^ 1 
could make out a pretty good argii^ 
ment that we worship machines; or 
the idea of the machine, anyway. 
What’s happening to those tapers out 
there is that Borg Traven’s dirowing 
them in a jumper, they see a grove 
burning with few losses of human 
soldiers, the hurt ones being zeeped 
back to hospital and operated on just 
as soon as they’re infected, even the 
bacteria, schizzy as they are, being 
held off and gradually worn down 
by our machines, on a worM thafs 
so non-tecbnological it basnet got the

“Every one of us is susceptible, 
in such a situaiion, to thinking how 
murii better off those people would 
be with good old Terran high speed 
waste disposal, portable shower 
baths, and ordering food by compu- 
ter. Would they really? Do they real- 
ly want this from us? Are we win- 
ning, even if we are winning? 

“Th& Bttle gadget is my insur- 
ance policy you won’t get brainwash-

pie days after you get there. 1 want 
that emotion fresh and hot Give me 
everything you’ve been saving for 
that permanent union» baby; because 
you may not get back from out there 
after we get this on the reel It may 
be the last tape you’ll ever dictate or 
ru ever splice ” 

Now she had done all Sam asked, 
all she asked of herself. Why wait? 
For a long time, she looked at two 
bottles of pills, picking up first one 
and then fte other. In the end, she 
took the dreambits rather than the 
quickdeath, but she could not have 
told why. 

N ext day, of course, was another 
day. Life so feeds on itself that 
just to be alive compels us to go on 
living, and living compels us to do 
things as if there woidd be an in- 
finity of days in which to do them. 
Haggle shopped for souvenirs in the 
morning, had a curiously teetotal 
lunch with Jack-Jack Frens, and in 
the afternoon responded to a com- 
municator call from General Tra- 
ven’s office. When the general asked, 
in his diffident way, if he might 
give her dinner, she shrugged. She 
could not feel ^at he was as anti- 
human as the policies he administer- 
ed. She was sure that she would 
never be asked to dinner by him 
again after word of her tape got 
back. That would be three weeks by 
tight beam radio, a week if they sent 
it by FTL courier, or a day, if the 
administration seized the FTL trans- 
mitter from All-Planet News and her 
instrument were in the hands of Borg 
Traven. Should she give it to him? 



She could not decide; but she took 
it in her gold mesh evening bag. 

For this evening, Haggle had 
chosen not to wear the coverall which 
was so easy to hide within. She had 
one good cocktail dress with her, 
one set of accessories, and she dis- 
posed the whole ensemble to do her- 
self full justice. Why? she asked her- 
self. I know Fll never be even a com- 
panion to this man, let alone join 
a permanent union. One-night jumps 
were never my style. So why the 
trouble? He said a native restaurant 
• • • that always means romance, on 
these colonial outposts. She stiffened 
her back, so that her ear drops hung 
like plumb bobs, and said to herself, 
At least he’ll Imow a real woman 
did it to him. Let his sun melt! 

She got into the cab beside a 
general resplendent in as near full 
dress uniform as regulations would 
permit in a combat zone. To her 
surprise, he also carried a side arm; 
and from a small knapsack on the 
seat, he extracted one of the new fil- 
ters for her to wear. “Wait a min- 
ute,’’ she said, drawing back from 
the proffered filter, “what kind of 
place are we going to? I think I’d 
prefer the officer’s club, even if your 
rank scares everybody else out of the 
place.’’ 

He smiled his little boy smile, and 
said, “My rank couldn’t keep those 
juice jockeys away from you, Har- 
Gret. You are a lovely woman, and 
none of us has seen anything like 
you in a year.’’ 

“Well, where are we going?’’ 

“It’s a genuine place. There may 
not be another human being besides 
us. No human food on the menu. But 

IF, 



66 




it’s secure. The filter is because we 
do have to transit a burnout near 
the edge of town, and there are 
saplings growing back in the area.** 
“Saplings!” she cried. “Must we 
fear saplings?” 

“Oh, they have roots, these young 
dendroids. That means they can spray 
poison. It might not be fatal, but I’ve 
no mind to be blind either.” They 
both slipped on the masks, but the 
burned section was hardly a hundred 
meters across, and they felt a little 
foolish when the cab deposited them 
at the restaurant without incident. 
Just before they arrived. Haggle 
asked, “How can you trust this Yip? 
Why aren’t you in a command car?” 
“We’re not in a command car be- 
cause I want to forget, just for to- 
night, what my job is out here. I 
trust her, anyhow . that’s right, it’s 
your old friend from the office. Here, 
Yipper,” he suddenly shouted, “turn 
around and give Miss Harker a hello 
smile!” 

The toadstool head slowly twisted 
until the bulbous eyes on top were 
directed at Haggle. The mantle slit 
rippled for two feet, and the den- 
droid said quietly, “I Yipper, Okay.” 

vm 

T he restaurant was unbelievably 
lovely and serene. It was not , 
exactly a building, but neither was 
it just a clearing in the woods. The 
light was hard to trace to its sources, 
great luminescent insects who flut- 
tered slowly overhead. The food and 
drink, thou^ exotic, were well with- 
in the range of human metabolism 
and appetite. 



Har-Gret Harker looked at General 
Traven over the liqueurs, which 
smoked greenly in leafy cups, and 
said, “Borg, you’re a good man. I 
don’t know why you’re doing a bad 
man’s job. I don’t want to hear your 
formula justifications for it. You 
love this world, and you love the 
people. I can tell that you even un- 
derstand a little of the dendroid 
language. If you had twigs, you’d 
try to speak it. I just want to say 
to you that you, you as Borg Traven, 
an existent human being, not Gen- 
eral Borger Traven as a memory 
pulse back at earth central computer, 
need to go. Now! While there’s some- 
thing to remember. This restaurant 
won’t be here in a year, Borg. This 
world wiQ be a ball of ashes, and you 
can’t stand to be here and keep push- 
ing the buttons that make it happen. 
Get out!” 

Just then a tiny pinging sounded 
on his wrist, and he lifted it to listen. 
In a moment, he said, “You’re right. 
I’m killing La Selva, and Selva’s 
death is killing me. I’m caught. I 
have my job to do, and I believe in 
it. I believe in Terra’s computerized 
democracy, and I hate the dead 
worlds where the bacteria rule. I’m 
willing to die myself to keep the 
bugs from Terra. Why shouldn’t a 
world, even a green and pleasant one 
like this, be willing to die for the 
same thing? There are a million 
worlds in the galaxy. Shall I let my 
affection — my love, if you like — 
for this one kill them all? 

“Come on. My wrist communi- 
cator just summoned me back to the 
office. There’s a massive night attack 
ten miles down the line from our 



THE GUERRILU TREES 



67 




enclave here, and something new is 
happening. I’ve got to get out there 
and see for myself. I’ll drop you at 
the hotel” 

She sat frozen. “I heard what your 
duty officer said. I heard it on this 
thing in my handbag.” 

H e nodded, unsmiling. “Yeah. Not 
much reaUy gets away from the 
central computer labs, you know. We 
didn’t know All-Planets had it, or 
you would have been searched when 
you got here. And yesterday after- 
noon, we couldn’t get a fix on you 
to shut you up. Where in Selva’s 
name were you?” 

“In my bathroom,” she replied 
mechanic^y. “But . doesn’t it 





make any difference to you that I’ve 
tripped the switch on the whole mur- 
derous adventure? That tape will light 
fires on earth from one pole to the 
other. Or will it be shown?” Now 
she was frightened. 

“Oh, sure it’ll be shown. Com- 
puter democracy. It just won’t make 
any difference. The machine is too 
directed toward this war. La Selva 
is too strategic a planet. Doubts are 
too costly. If we drop back here, we 
drop back all across the galaxy. It 
means abandoning a thousand plan- 
ets. So YipYap is going to die, 
that all the rest may live. People 
feel the administration must know 
more than they about what’s best. 
Come on.” 

They walked in silence to the cab, 
and rode silently for a few minutes. 
As they approached the burnout, so 
that they were out of the shade, the 
tiny planet’s tinier moon cast its 
aquamarine light into the cab. Gen- 

THE GUERRILLA TREE^ 



eral Traven’s head was back on the 
cushion. He seemed too weary even 
to adjust the filter. Haggle had 
slipped hers on, but she felt foolish, 
even only ten miles away from where 
trees were killing human soldiers. 
Something new, she thought, what 
could that be? 

The cab glided into the burnout. 
“This good place,” hissed the den- 
droid driver. The cab stopped, and 
as Borg Traven sat up and reached 
for his side arm, soldier’s instincts 
aroused at last, a root appeared over 
the back of the seat and a concen- 
trated jet of poisonous liquid spread 
over the general’s face. It was so 
virulent that it had not yet begun 
to drip on his uniform when he sank 
back, dead. 

“Yipper,” said Haggie, in a trans- 
port of fear, “don’t kill me. You 
can’t kill me, anyway, I have the 
filter on. 1 won’t let you strangle me, 
because I have the general’s pistol. 
It fires the exploding water, Yip- 
per! Sit still and listen. I’m your 
friend. Yes, and Yapsl’s friend, too. 
I love this world and its people, all 
of them. I don’t care what we want 
here, Yipper, we’re wrong to be 
here. I’ve sent the word to the earth 
that may get us all off La Selva. 
Take be back to the hotel and I’ll 
help more. I’ll say Traven was all 
right when he left me off. You can 
just disappear into the forests . 
or go back to the office. I don’t 
care. I can help you, Yipper, more 
than any other human being. Let me 
live, Yipper, and I’ll let you live. I’ll 
help your people to live, thousands 
of them.”

“There’s a world out there. What

A place called Krags, from a

“Be quiet. Pig!” 

“From a city called Venice. At

canal, singing and joking with the 
girls, while I try to point out to 
Bruno the historic bits of architecture 
that have fascinated men of earth 
since Ruskin. They storm down the 
alley to the Mensa, rollick over the 
Ponte Academia, its boards brown 
and hung with moss underneath, pass 
the little wine shops, then upstairs, 
where you pound on the doors to 
make the cooks let you in and then 
everybody is eating and singing, and 
Bruno is telling you that it is all right, 
not to worry, and you cannot be sad 
any more because it is Venice . ” 
“Hey, wa’ ’sa matter. Mister

“Go on. Cage.” 

“Have either of you ever seen 
Brass from the outside?” 

“Sure as hell can’t see it from the

“Shut up, Pig. No.” 

“It’s on a plane of rock and snow. 
Even the clouds are scrawny. They 
shroud the nights and let the stars 
peak down on Brass itself. And it just 
sits there and doesn’t look back.”

seen Brass, Mr. Cage.” 
“Yeah, how’da ya know what it 
looks like?” 

“I’ve seen a picture. I’ve seen 
many things I’m not supposed to 
have seen. Pig. I was an architectural 
student, you see.” 



“On Earth?” 

“In Venice?” 

“That’s right. I was once allowed 
access to the plans. 1 got a chance 
to see where all the corridors go and 
where they come from.” 

“You did?” 

“I could tell you where every 
brick and block on Hagia Sofia is 
placed and mortared. I could tell you 
how they put together the optical- 
illusory temple of Ancqor on the 
world of Keplar down to the last 
mirror. And I know every blind cor- 
ridor and twist and turn and gate 
and time lock and drainage conduit 
in Brass.” 

“You do?” 

“Hey, you mean you know how 
you could get out of here?” 

“Venice ...” 

“Hey, Hawk. Maybe Cage knows 
how to get us out of herel” 

“Shut up. Pig. Keep talking. 
Cage.” 

“Venice, that’s so far away now; 
no more nights in the wine shop 
while Giamba throws his knife to cut 
the sausages hanging from the rafters; 
those nights where we drank the 
wine from the south and the wine 
from the north to see which was 
sweeter. They are gone. Bruno is 
gone. And so is the beautiful lazy- 
eyed girl who destroyed it all, Bruno, 
me, and the beautiful girl called — ” 
“Cagel” 

“ — Sapphire!” 

“Cage, listen to me!” 

“Yeah, you better listen to HawkI” 
“Sapphire is gone . ” 

“Can you tell us how come these 
three coffins can talk to one another? 
1 been in one coffin before this one.

I cried and screamed and whimpered 
like a dog there. But this is the first 
one where I ever heard anyone an- 
swer. All the answer I got was Pig. 
But it was more than before. What 
is it, some kind of whispering cham- 
ber effect?” 

“Why we three can . hear?” 
“Yeah, can you tell Hawk an’ me 
that? I been in two before this one an’ 
I ain’t never heard no voices.” 

“The tri-nexus . yes, that must 
be it. The prisoners in Brass are 
stored in glycerine coffins that feed 
and wash them and minister to any 
medical needs and keep them from 
hurting themselves ... too badly. 
You can hurt yourself just to the 
point of death, then the coffin knocks 
you out with drugs and makes you 
get better. You can get out of it to 
exercise once a day, in the dark, in 
a little stone cubicle — ” 

“Yeah, yeah. We know all that. 
Cage. But why the parly-parly in 
these three coffins?” 

“At the tri-nexus — that’s at the 
very bottom of the prison, three 
chambers come together around the 
old drainage pipes. Hollow metal 
pipes instead of stone between these 
three chambers. A new drainage sys- 
tem was put in a hundred and fifty 
years ago. If the pipes were filled up 
with waste and things, then you 
couldn’t hear. But the new system 
goes somewhere else. Now that the 
pipes are empty, these three coffins 
in the lowest level have . well, 
you can hear . through the drains.” 
“What about getting out. Mister 
Cage? Hawk and me sure would like 
to get out of this.” 

“Quiet, Pig.”

emptying along the canal, into the 
water, the bits of paper, the leaves, 
the filth of animals and humans float-

of the city . ” 

“What’s ’a matter with *im. 
Hawk?” 

“Just listen. Pig.” 

“. , alone, wandering alone in the 
back alleys of the city, the sky run- 
ning like purple waters between the 
narrow rooftops, the water beside me

open between crumbling stones. Oh, 
it’s a terrible city, beautiful with its 
wells and its rusted railings, and its 
rickety porches hanging over the 
water, its shop windows alive with 
the glass of Murano, its children 
dark-eyed and dark-haired with skin 
like dirty soap, city of beauty, city 
of loneliness .... ”

^ you hear about it all the time, 
the prison without guards. It’s all 
automatic. All the coffin changing, 
the feeding, it all goes on without 
guards. Now you say you know how 
Brass is laid out. How can we believe 
all that?” 

“I know. I knew the stones of the 
city better than Ruskin, better than 
Persey. I knew the crack in the rock 
where Napoleon laid his pick to the 
Ponte San Marco, and I know the 
workings of the locks in the dungeon 
by which the Doge could flood the 
lower chambers of the prison when 
he had to be rid of vast numbers of 
political prisoners without question; 
I knew the passage by which Titian’s

from St. Mary’s to the cellar of Di 
Trevi the wool merchants, or the 
foundations for the gate by which 
Marino visited Angiolkia before their 
betrothal. I have walked down the 
staircase of the palace as had Byron 
and Shelley, and like them 1 had 
found the secret entrance into the 
palazzo Scarlotti where the nightly 
debouches are still being carried on 
by the decadent sons of the sons of 
Fottia, in the mirrored halls, in the 
tapestried pavillions. All of the city 
was open to me, and I was profound- 
ly alone.” 

“What’s he talkin’, Hawk?” 

“Shhh ” 

“And into my aloneness, into the 
Venetian evening, came Sapphire. 
Hawk, Pig, have you ever seen a 
woman?” 

“Hey, Hawk, I think he’s outa his 
head.” 

“Pig, who was the- most beautiful 
woman you ever saw?” 

“Huh? Well, there was Jody-b, and 
when I us’ta bring in my haul back 
in the caves of Dusk, she’d laugh and 
wollop me and wrestle me for the 
best pieces, and the others would stand 
around the fire, hoopin’ and holler- 
ing, and bettin’ on which of us, she 
or me, would win — ” 

“I knew a woman in Ruption. She 
walked in the burning streets of the 
city, and the flames fell back into 
the earth around her. Her name was 
Lanza, and when she dropped her 
fire-colored hair across my face, her 
fire-colored mouth on mine — ” 
“Neither of you have known Sap- 
phire. Neither of you have known a 
woman. She was the daughter of an 
Ambassador to Earth from the thir- 



teenth planet of Sirius. You come 
from Krags and Alba? She had sum- 
mered on one and wintered on the 
other and found them dull, tawdry, 
productive of incomparable ennui. 
And she had come to Venice. 1 saw 
her three times in one afternoon. 
Venice is a small city, and if you are 
wandering the streets, you will pass 
other wanderers many times: first on 
the steps of the bridge at Ferovia, 
while women with their husbands 
carried their baby carriages across 
the steps, and lottery venders hurried 
by, their sticks streaming with tickets. 
Again, at the Rialto, I saw her as 
they were closing the stalls along the 
bridge, and she stopped to examine 
a flask, then replace it and*look over 
the balustrade into the water; the 
third time, when I dared speak to her, 
was on a little back canal, where she 
had stopped on the tiny Ponte Diav- 
olo, leaning on the rail, while the sun- 
set gilded the swell of water that 
flapped at the rotten, rusty stones. I 
came upon her just as she was offer- 
ing a piece of something to one of 
the cats. I ran to her, struck her hand 
away, and when she drew back, 
frightened and surprised, I explained 
that the wild cats that roamed the city 
were vicious, many of them diseased, 
and that with so much fishing in the 
city they could fend for themselves. 
First she looked offended, then just 
annoyed, but at last she laughed and 
agreed to go with me when I invited 
her back to the university, begged her 
to come, explained how much fun 
the students were, how delightful the 
city could be with good companion- 
ship, till at last she smiled and ex- 
claimed, “Why, you popr, lonely

man. Of course I’ll come with you,** 
and she came> while I told her iU 
about the prizes I’d won» and the 
buildings I’d planned, and the papers 
I’d written; and when we reached the 
Grand Ca^, I helped her onto the 
vapperetto; and as we plowed the 
water between the gorgeous facades, 
I pointed out to her Ca’doro, the 
the Scholas and the great merchant^ 
palazzos that towered into the evening 
behind the colored landing poles, 
their reflections shimmering until the 
public-boat’s ripples shattered them. 
And when we went up to the stu- 
dents’ dining room, oh, they were so 
friendly with us, and Bruno came all 
the way over to invite us to the party 
he was giving that night. ‘I coiddn’t 
find you earlier or I would have in- 
vited you before,’ he explained. And 
that night we drank wine and danced 
on the balcony, and the breeze lifted 
Sapphire’s scarf and hung It over the 
moon for a moment so that her face 
was in shadow, and I held her hand, 
and she smiled in shadow, and below 
the water carried flecks of silver down 
toward a bridge. And then the scarf 
dropped again . .” 

CCTJTey, Hawk! He’s stopped talk- 

AX in’.” 

“Cage? Hey, come on, Cage,” 

«W-w-why ” 

“That’s right. Go on. Cage.” 

“Why do . men commit crimes? 
Your voices in the darkness, why do 
men commit crimes in the first 
place?” 

“I guess I jus’ did it ’cause I was 
hungry. It gets cold at Dusk. I got 
hungry, and stealin’ was easier than 
workin’. Only I got cau^t. Which 



would’a been okay, only I got hungry 
again an’ stole some more. Bout the 
fifth time or so, after I’d beat up on 
a couple of patrol men, and two of 
them £ed, they just threw their hands 
up and threw me down in Brass. You 
say why do people — ” 

“I say why is this. Cage. The 
streets of Ruption are filled with hot 
fires and hot men; there is revenge; 
there is pride; there is the writhing 
hate for the workings of a decadent 
world that curses us with morality. 
That’s why I ran my gang of marau- 
ders and looters through the coffers 
of the city, battled the flying patrol- 
men from the roofs of the palace, 
watching my men fall around me, 
laughing as the floodlights swept the 
roof and I shook my rist at the sky 
that blazed with the fires of their jets 
bright as the fires of the streets, fir- 
ing back, till I was the only one 
left — ” 

“No .... Hawk. That’s not it. 
Pig. Or perhaps that’s what it is with 
some men. But with me it was so 
much more, so much more. It was 
later in the evening, when again I 
went on the balcony, to clear my 
head I was light-headed from joy 
and wine, and as I gazed on the water, 
the lights reeled before me, my knees 
gave and I fell with my face pressed 
to the cold bars, looking over the 
red-tiled roofs of the city, bleached 
now by the lowering moon. For a 
moment I thought my exaltation was 
to be replaced by sickness. I pushed 
myself up, turned back to stagger be- 
tween the glass doors, with the cur- 
tains shaking in the breeze. Wine 
bottles had spilled on the rug. Giamba 
lay on the couch, his hair awry, his

IF 




shirt wet with his own bile. The 
plates of hors d’oeuvres were half 
empty, and even those that were not 
had been used for ash trays. The only 
light in the room was from the stub 
of a candle in one, still-upright bottle. 
The moon reached in white fingers 
and brushed away the shadows. I 
staggered forward. They were all 
gone, I thought at first. Then, in the 
doorway of Brimo’s room I saw them. 

“Blades of pain shot into my head, 
tried to unfix my eyesi I swallowed 
what rose in my throat, swallowed 
what rose again! Muscles all over my 
body began to shake. Then something 
came out — I thought it would be 
a scream, but it was laughter. 

“Bruno raised his face from her 
neck, frowned. Then he asked, Wear- 
ily, ‘Are you going now — * 

“ ‘Oh, yes,’ I told him. *But the two 
of you must come with me. The night 
is just beginning. Come, come, I ^ 
show you a really go^ time.’ She 
looked at me, as drunk as he was, 
and I knew diat for a moment she 
did not even remember who I was. 
Oh, I was maniacal with my laughter. 
1 hustled Bruno, protesting, into his 
jacket; and as I wrapped her scarf 
again and again about her shoulders, 
I suddenly felt her start, pull away 
from me, but I pretended not to 
notice, chattered on cheerily, and al- 
most pushed them out into the hall- 
way, where Bruno asked, ‘Now what 
party would anybody in Venice in- 
vite you to?’ Only I just laughed, and 
soon we were out on the little walk- 
way beside the canal. 

“‘This way! This way,’ and they 
followed me down beside the cana- 
letti, then out to the Campanile, up 



the arch of the Academy Bridge, and 
across the broad end of the Strada 
Nova, into the tiny alley that has no 
name. We crossed another of the 
city’s thousand bridges (there aren’t 
really a thousand; only six hundred 
and eighty-two) and hurried beneath 
the covered water-way. It let us out 
two small streets from the clutter of 
steps rising to the Ferovia side of the 
Rialto. But we moved off down to 
little blue-tiled walkway, then pushed 
throught a gate and hurried down 
an alley where the lights were out. I 
started to climb the low wall. 

44 4TXThere are we ... ’ she be- 
VV gan. But Bruno shhhhhed 
and laughed. ‘I’ve been a student in 
the City almost a year, and I still 
don’t know. But Jason knows every 
gutter and alley of the plaee. He’s 
getting us there by a short cut.* Then 
he growled, ‘I hope we get where 
you’re going soon.’ But I just hurried 
them along. 1 remember she said 
once ‘. But there’s no rail to the 
canal here — * but by then I was work- 
ing loose the grate. *In here, in here 
. .’ Again Bruno explained for me, 
‘Jason likes to pull surprises on peo- 
ple. He’s always crawling up from 
somebody’s cellar. Venice is a city of 
intrigue, you know . .’ But by then, 
by then our breaths were echoing in 
the dark passage. Our feet splashed, 
and she had begun half-crying noises. 
But again 1 just urged them on faster. 
‘Don’t worry,’ Bruno assured her, but 
his voice was almost as unsteady as 
hers. ‘Jason doesn’t get all these 
prizes each year for nothing. He’s 
got an absolute sense of spatiid rela- 
tions. He can*t get lost.* We passed 



CAGE OF BRASS 



77 




under a grating which let half a dozen 
blades of moonlight through the fog 
and down beside the underground 
bridge we were crossing. She caught 
her breath. There was no rail here 
either. I told them to watch out for 
the steps. We left the moonlight, and 
in another fifteen minutes we were 
there. 1 closed a door behind us and 
let out my breath. ‘We’re here,* I 
told them. ‘Come on, Bruno, I need 
your help.’ I moved along the wall, 
the blueprints almost visible before 
my eyes. Four steps, five. ‘Duck your 
head, Bruno!’ and, ‘Here. Give me 
a hand.’ I guided him to the great 
bar across the wheel. ‘Now, bear 
down on this with me.’ He took the 
bar. ‘Will this get us into the party? I 
don’t hear any — I stopp^ him. 
‘This way to the cellar. Come on, 
lean on it.* At first I thought the 
ancient lock wouldn’t budge. My toes 
came up off the dusty stone. lien I 
felt Bruno lend his weight, and — it 
gave! Metal ground. I heard the 
weights fall. Then a rush of water. I 
heard her say, ‘What was that? Bru- 
no, Jason?’ And then she let out a 
cry. Water splashed about my feet. 
‘Hey!’ Bruno said, ‘what’s all this?* I 
backed away from the lock, and be- 
gan to laugh. “We’re in the dungeon, 
the Duke’s dungeon, on the lowest 
level, where he had the water locks! 
You remember, Bruno? Where he 
could open the flood gates to drown 
his prisoners?* 

“‘Hey, if this is some kind of a 
joke, Jason, it’s not funny!’ 1 heard 
her s[dashing toward us now, ‘How 
do we get out of here? Which way 
do we go? It’s all pitch dark.* Then 
she cried out and stumbled. Because 



the water was rushing so hard now, 
it was difficult to stand. It had al- 
ready reached our knees. I just started 
to back away. They splashed after- 
ward. She came near us, then hit her 
head on the overhang of stone, fell. 
Bruno tried to help her; then, all at 
once, he was raging. He dived for 
me, caught me. ‘Look, you’re going 
to drown too if you think you’re go- 
ing to drown us.’ She was splashing 
towards us, just screaming. I tried to 
pull away, but both of them got me. 
We fell in the water. Her scarf, I 
remember, was wet between my fin- 
gers. I just stayed under, swam down, 
which they weren’t expecting and . 
got away. With the currents, it was 
hard to judge the distances accurate- 
ly, but I surfaced once more, took 
a breath, then dove beneath the low 
wall, already under water, clawed my 
way under the stone, then at last shot 
up to the surface, pulled myself up 
the stairs. The water was all the way 
up the stairs. I could hear them 
screaming behind the rocks. When I 
stood, the water was all the way up to 
my chest . They found me, wan- 
dering across the Piazza, in front of 
the Byzantine facade of St, Mark’s, 
passing through the shadows of the 
four great bronze horses thrown from 
the basilica’s roof. I was soaking wet, 
and was dragging her wet scarf be- 
hind me.** 

“By all the gods of Krags — ” 

“By the single god of Alba — ” 

“By whatever gods there are left 
on Earth, I tell you I laughed like a 
demon. They foimd me. They found 
me, and I told them. The alarms had 
already gone off. But, by then, it was 
too late. The Doges were very effi-

dent. Very . because she was the 
daughter of an ambassador from an- 
other world, it became an interworld 
offense. So instead of incarcerating 
me in the city, they sent me here, 
here to the interworlds prison called 
Brass . 

CCTTey, Hawk, he ain’t talkin’ no 
a 1 more!” 

“Cage? Look, Jason Cage, you say 
you know the architecture of Brass 
as well as you knew the setup of that 
dungeon in . what-ever-it’s-name- 
was? Come on, now! Talk.” 

“I know. I know them all. I know 
the floorplan for the Shining Mosque 
in Iran. I know the structure of cel- 



lars in the Museum of Life at Beta- 
Centauri. If Daedalus had ever left 
plans for the Labyrinth itself, had I 
but seen them once, I would have 
needed no thread . ” 

“Then what about Brass, Cage? 
How about where we are now? Do 
you think you could get us out of 
here?” 

“Here at the . tri-nexus? Very 
near, there are the . , yes, the tun- 
nels that the original workman used 
to enter and leave the structure, when 
they built the thing, five hundred 
years ago. But . but they are 
sealed off. Leave, you say? But how 
can I leave? I am guilty. My heart 
is all crusted with the metal of guilt. 




CAGE OF BRASS 



79 



I am here ... to suffer. Yes! Even 
if I were to leave, guilt is a prison 
around my heart.” 

“Hey, Hawk, I think he really 
gone nuts.” 

“Listen, Cage. Where we are, here 
at this tri-nexus, is there any way you 
know of to get into that tunnel?” 
“You . you want to get out? 
But . but ... I killed them. I’m 
guilty. I deserve — ” 

“Look, Cage!” 

“My crimes make all the worlds 
guilty.” 

“Come on. Mister Cage. We wan- 
na get out.” 

“Talk, Cage. Talk more.” 

“She was . she was beautiful as 
water, as fire, as fog — ” 

“Talk about Brass!” 

“Brass? Yes, Brass ... the prison, 
the prison with the three chambers 
near the workman’s tunnel. The key- 
stones, perhaps. Yes, they wouldn’t 
be set.” 

“What are you talking about. 
Cage? Make it so I can see it, clear as 
Venice.” 

“These three cells we’re in. They 
come together around the drainage 
system like three fat slices of cake 
with their points together. The walls 
would be where the knife goes — ” 
“And the drain is where you’d put 
the candle for a one-year-old’s birth- 
day?” 

“That’s right. And the stones in 
the joining walls, near the tip, they 
can’t be mortared in. They weigh 
perhaps three hundred pounds 
apiece.” 

“Three hundred pounds? One per- 
son couldn’t move that. Hawk.” 

“But two could. Pig.” 



“And each covers a drop shaft in- 
to the worker’s tunnel that winds and 
turns and rises to the rocks out- 
side . .” 

“If you pushed from your side. 
Pig, then I pulled from the 
other . ” 

“What about him?” 

“Cage, we can move our stone out, 
and then move yours — ” 

“No. No, this is where I quit” 
“Hawk, the lid is starting to open 
for exercise period. Come on, let’s 
get that stone.” 

“Cage, you won’t be able to move 
your stone by yourself. You better 
let us help you. Once we go, you’ll 
be here forever.” 

“No! No ... I belong here. I must 
stay here ... I must ... I have to 
stay and be part of the great tower 
of Brass, like one of its very rocks, 
become part of the bedrock itself. I 
can hear, you now, hear the stone 
scraping against the stone. You grunt. 
You pant. But it moves, slowly. Yes, 
I hear it moving, like the great lock 
in the dungeon of the Doge, scraping, 
scraping. There! You’ve got it now 
. Pig? What tasks of knavery had 
you bent those shoulders to on Alba? 
Hawk, what did you pit your strength 
against to strain such force into being 
at Krags? Pig . .? Hawk . .? 
Hawk . ? Pig — ! I can’t hear 
you any more! Have you . gone? 
Pig? Hawk . ?” 

Describe the silence inside Brass? 
Now it too was complete. Perhaps 
you could hint at it by a lack of 
words. Perhaps you could hint at it 
by saying once the voices left, there 
was — nothing.

brainy, lovely, man-crazy — 
and eight and a half feet tall ! 



I 

T he day Papa came home was the 
day my mama came home to me. 
That’s the way I looked at Earth’s 
first alien contact. We may have 
changed some of our ideas about 
what’s human, but one thing hasn’t 



changed: The big history-tape events 
are still just background for the real 
I-Me-You drama. Not true? So, 
wasn’t the U.S.-Soviet treaty signed 
the weekend you caught your first 
marlin? 

Anyway, there they were, sitting 
on Luna. Although it’s not generally 




known, there’s been a flap about a 
moving source around Pluto the year 
before. That’s when C.I.A. decided 
that outer space fell under the cate- 
gory of foreign territory in its job 
description — at least to the extent 
of not leaving the U.S. Air Force in 
total control of contact with the gal- 
axy. So our little shop shared some 
of the electronic .excitement. The 
Russians helped some; they’re the 
acknowledged champs at heaving up 
the tonnage, but we still have the 
communications lead — we try hard- 
er. The British and the Aussies try 
too, but we keep hiring their best 
men. 

That first signal went to nothing 
— until one fine April evening all 
our communications went snap- 
crackle-pop, and the full moon rose 
with this big alien hull parked on 
the Lunar Alps. Sat there for three 
days, glowing bluishly in any six- 
power lens — if you could buy one. 
And you’ll recall, we had no manned 
moon-station then. After peace broke 
out, nobody wanted to spend cash on 
vacuum and rocks. The shape our 
space program was in, we couldn’t 
have hit them with a paper-clip in 
less than three months. 

On A-Day plus one I spotted Tillie 
at the water-cooler. 

To do so I had to see through two 
doors and Mrs. Peabody, my secre- 
tary, but I’d got pretty good at this. 
I wandered out casually and said: 

“How’s George doing?” 

She gave me a one-eyed scowl 
through her droopy wing of hair, 
finished her water, and scowled again 
to make sure she wasn’t smiling. 

“He came back after midnight. 



He’s had six peanut-butter sand- 
wiches. I think he’s getting it.” 

There are people who’ll tell you 
Tillie is an old bag of bones in a 
seersucker suit. For sure she has 
bones, and she’s no girl. But if you 
look twice it can get a little hard to 
notice other people in the room. I’d 
done the double take about three 
years back. 

“Meet me at lunch, and I’ll show 
you something.” 

She nodded moodily and lounged 
off. I watched the white knife-scar 
ripple elegantly on her tanned legs 
and went back through my office, 
fighting off the urge to push Mrs. 
Peabody’s smile into her Living Bra. 

Our office is a Uttle hard to ex- 
plain. Everybody knows C.I.A. is out 
in that big building at Langley, but 
the fact is that when they built it 
there it fit about as well as a beagle- 
house fits a Great Dane. They got 
most of the Dane in somehow, but 
we’re one of the paws and tails that 
got left out. Strictly a support facility 
— James Bond would sneer at us. 
We operate as a small advertising 
agency in a refined section of D.C. 
which happens to be close to a heavy 
land transmitter cable and the Naval 
Observatory gadgets. Our girls actual- 
ly do some ads for other government 
agencies — something about Smokey 
the Bear and Larry Litterbug is all

and cold war leftovers like me. A 
computer N.S.A. spilled coffee into. 
And George. George is our pocket 
genius. It is generally believed he got 
started making pop movies for yaks 
in Outer Mongolia, He lives on 
peanut butter and Tillie works for 
him. 

So, when the aliens started trans- 
mitting at us, George was among the 
facilities Langley called on to help 
decipher. And ^so me, in a small, 
passive way — I look at interesting 
photography when the big shop wants 
a side opinion. Because of my past as 
a concocter of fake evidence in the 
bad old days. Hate that word fake. 
Mine is still being used by historians. 

C ome lunchtime I went looking for 
Tillie at Rapa’s, our local life- 
line. Since Big Broker at Langley 
found that our boys and girls were 
going to Rapa’s instead of eating 
G.S.A. boiled cardboard, Rapa’s old 
cashier has been replaced by a virgin 
with straight seams and a camera in 
each, ah, eyeball — but the chow is 
still good 

Tillie was leaning back relaxed, a 
dreamy double-curve smile on her 
long mouth. She heard me and wiped 
it off. The relaxation was a fake; I 
saw her hand go over some shredded 
matches. 

She smiled again, like someone 
had offered her fifty cents for her 
right arm. But she was okay. I knew 
her, this was one of her good days. 
We ordered veal and pasta, friendly. 

“T^e a look,” I invited. “We 
finally synched in with their beam 
for a few frames.” 

The photo showed one side foggy. 



the rest pretty clear. Tillie goggled. 

. “It’s — it’s — ” 

“Yeah, it’s beautiful. She^s beauti- 
ful. And the dead spit of you, my 
girl.” 

“But Max! Are you sure?” Her 
using my name was a good sign. 

“Absolute. We saw her move. This, 
kid, is The Alien. We’ve had every 
big cine collection in the world check- 
ing. It’s not a retransmission. See that 
script on her helmet and that back- 
ground panel? Tain’t nobody’s. No 
doubt where the send is from, either. 
That ship up there is full of people- 
type people. At least, women .... 
^at’s George got?” 

“You’ll see the co-copy,” she said 
absently, grooving on the photo. “He 
worked out about 200 words in clear. 
It’s weird. They want to land — and 
something about Mother. Like, 
Mother is back, or is home. George 
says ‘Mother’ is the best he can do.” 

“If that’s Mother, oh my. Here’s 
your pasta.” 

They landed a week later, after 
considerable international wrangling. 
At Mexico City, as everyone knows. 
A small VTO affair. Thanks to 
George’s connections — in the literal 
sense — we had it on closed circuit 
right over the crowd of world dig- 
nitaries and four million real people. 

The airlock opened on a world- 
wide hush, and Mother came out. 
One — and then another — and a 
third. Last one out fiddled with 
something on her wrist, and the lock 
closed. We found out later she was 
the navigator. 

There they stood on their ramp, 
three magnificent earth-type yoimg 
females in space-opera uniforms. 



THE MOTHER SHIP

Helmets on the backs of their heads 
and double-curve grins on tjieir long 
mouths. The leader was older and 
had more glitter on her crest. She 
swung back her droopy wing of hair, 
breathed twice, wrinided her nose 
and paced down the ramp to meet the 
U.N. president. 

Then we got it. The U.N. Presi- 
dent that year was an Ethiopian about 
six feet five. The top of his head 
came just to the buckle on her cross- 
belt. 

I guess the world-wide hush quiver- 
ed — it certainly did in George’s 
projection room. 

“About eight foot three for the 
captain,” I said. 

“Assuming the top of the head is 
normal,” George chirped. That was 
what they loved him for. 

In the dimness I saw a funny look 
on Tillie’s face. Several girls were 
suppressing themselves, and Mrs. 
Peabody seemed to feel an egg hatch- 
ing in her uplift. The men looked like 
me — tense. Right then I would have 
settled for green octopusses instead of 
those three good-looking girls. 

The captain stepped back from 
President Enkaladugunu and said 
something in a warm contralto, and 
somehow we all relaxed. She seemed 
wholesome, if you can imagine a mix 
of Garbo and Moshe Dayan. The 
other two officers were clearly very 
young, and — well, I told you, they 
could have been Tillie’s sisters except 
for size. 

George got that; I saw his eyes go- 
ing between Tillie and the screen. 

To his disgust, all the talking was 
being done by our people. The three 



visitors stood it well, occasionally 
giving brief, melodious responses. 
They looked mightily relaxed, and 
also somewhat puzzled. The two 
young J.O.’s were scanning hard at 
the crowd, and twice I saw one nudge 
the other. 

Mercifully a Soviet-U.S.-Indian 
power play choked off the oratory, 
and got the party adjourned to Mexi- 
co’s Guest Palace — or rather, to an 
unscheduled pause in the colonnade 
while beds were being lashed together 
and sofas substituted for chairs. Our 
circuit went soft. George shut him- 
self up with his tapes of the aliens’ 
few remarks, and I coped with a 
flock of calls about our observing 
devices, which got buggered up in the 
furniture-moving orgy. 

Two days later the party was mov- 
ed to the Popo-Hilton with the swim- 
ming pool as their private bath. 
Every country on earth — even the 
Chicoms — sent visiting delegations. 
George was going through fits. He 
was bound and determined to be the 
expert on Mama’s language by re- 
mote control. We really had no offi- 
cial mission, but I had an in with 
the Mexicali bureau, and we did 
pretty well imtil about twenty other 
outfits got into the act and the elec- 
tronic feedback put us all in the 
hash. 

“Funny thing. Max,” said George 
at morning staff. “They keep asking 
— I can only interpret as, ‘Where 
are the women?”’ 

“You mean, like women officials? 
Women in power jobs?” 

“Simpler, I think. Perhaps big 
women, like themselves. But I get a 
connotation of grown-up, women, 



84 



IF 




adults. I need more of their talk 
among themselves. Max.” 

“We’re trying, believe it They keep 
flushing all the cans and laughing 
like mad, 1 don’t know if it’s our 
plumbing or our snoops that amuse 
them. Did you hear about Tuesday?” 
Tuesday my shivers had come 
back. For half an hour every re- 
cording device out to a half-mile 
perimeter went dead for forty min- 
utes, and nothing else was a^ected. 

Another department was getting 
shivery too. Harry from R & D called 
me to see if we could get a better 
look at that charm bracelet the nav- 
igator had closed the ship with. 

“We can’t get so much as a gam- 
ma particle into that danm boat,” he 
told me. “Touch it — smooth as 
glass. Try to move it, blowtorch it, 
burrow under it, laser it, bombard it 
— nothing. It just sits there. We need 
that control. Max.” 

“She wears it taking a bath, Hal. 
No emissions we can read.” 

“I know what I’d do,” he grunted. 
“Those cream-heads up there are in 
a daze.” 

n 

A daze it was. The world at large 
loved them. They were now on 
a Grand Tour, being plied with enter- 
tainment, scenic wonders and tech- 
nology. The big girls ate it up — 
figuratively and literally. Badloon 
glasses of dubrovka went down es- 
pecially well from breakfast on, and 
they were glowingly complimentary 
about everything, from Sun Valley 
to the Great Barrier Reef, with stop- 
overs at every atomic and space in- 



stallation. Captain Garbo-Dayan real- 
ly unl^t on the Cote d’Azur, and the 
two had lost their puzzled 

looks. In fact, they were doing a 
good deal of what would have looked 
like leering if they didn’t have such 
wholesome smiles. 

“What the hell?” I asked George. 

“They think we’re cute,” he said, 
enjoying himself. Did I tell you he 
was a tiny little man? That figures, 
with Tillie working for him. He loved 
to see us big men squinting up at the 
Girls from Capella, as the world now 
called them. 

They were from a system near 
Capella, they explained in delightful 
fragments of various Earth languages. 
Their low voices really had charm. 
Why had they come? Well, they were 
a tramp freighter, actually, taMng a 
load of ore back to Capella. They 
had dropped by to clear up an old 
chart notation about our system. 
What was their home like? Oh, much 
like ours. Lots of commerce, trade. 
Wars? Not for centuries. Shocking 
idea! 

What the world wanted to know 
most, of course, was where were 
their men? Were they alone? 

This evoked merry laughter. Of 
course they had men, to care for the 
ship. They showed us on a video 
broadcast from Luna. There were 
indeed men, handsome types with 
muscles. The chap who did most of 
the transmission looked like my idea 
of Leif Ericsson. There was no doubt, 
however, that Captain Garbo-Dayan 
— or Captain Lyampka, as we learn- 
ed to call her — was in charge. Well, 
we had female Soviet freighter cap- 
tains, too. 



THE MOTHER SHIP 



85 




The one thing we couldn’t get 
exactly was the Capellan men’s rela- 
tive heights. The scenery on these 
transmissions was different. It was 
my private opinion, from juggling 
some estimates of similar background 
items, that at least some of their men 
were earth-normal size, though burly. 

The really hot questions about their 
space drive got gracefully laughed off. 
How did the ship run? They were 
not technicians! But then they sprang 
the bombshell. Why not come and 
see for ourselves? Would we care 
to send a party up to Luna to look 
over the ship? Would we? Would we? 
How many? Oh, about fifty — fifty 
men, please. And Tillie. 

I forgot to mention about Tillie 
getting to be their pet. George had 
sent her to Sun Valley to record some 
speech samples he absolutely had to 
have. She was introduced at the pool. 
Immediate hit. She looked incredibly 
like a half-size Capellan. They loved 
it. Laughed almost to guffawing. 
When they found she was a crack 
linguist they adopted her. George 
was in ecstasy with hauls of Capellan 
chatter no one else had, and Tillie 
seemed to like it. She was different 
these days — her eyes shone, and she 
had a Idnd of tense, exalted smile. 
I knew why, and it bothered me, but 
there wasn’t anything I could do. 

I cut myself into her report-cir- 
cuit one day. 

“Tillie. It’s dangerous. You don’t 
know them.” 

Safe at 2,000 miles, she gave me 
the bare-faced stare. 

**They*re dangerous?** 

I winced and gave it up. Tillie at 
fifteen had caught the full treatment 



from a street gang. Fought against 
knives, left for dead — an old story. 
They’d fixed her up as good as new, 
except for a few interesting white 
hairlines in her tan, and a six-inch 
layer of ice between her and every- 
body who shaved. It didn’t show, 
most of the time. She had a nice 
sincere cover manner, and she wore 
her old suits and played mousey. 
But it was permanent guerrilla war, 
inside. 

Intelligence had found her, as they 
often do, a ready-made weapon. She 
was totally loyal, as long as no one 
touched her. And she’d wear anything 
or nothing on business. I’d seen pho- 
tos of Tillie on a job at twenty-five 
that you wouldn’t believe. Fantastic 
— the subtle sick flavor added, too. 

She let people touch her, physical- 
ly, I mean, on business. I imagine — 
I never asked. And I never asked 
what happened to them afterward, 
or why the classified medal. It did 
trouble me a little when I found out 
her chief case officer was dead — 
but that was all right, he’d had dia- 
betes for years. 

But as for letting a friend touch 
her — really touch her — I tried it 
once. 

I t was in George’s film-vault. We 
were both exhausted after a fifty- 
hour run of work. She had lean^ 
back and smiled, and actually touched 
my arm. My arm went around her 
automatically and I started to bend 
down to her lips. At the last minute 
I saw her eyes. 

Before 1 got pastured out to 
Smokey Bear and George, 1 had 
worked around a little, and one of 



86 



IP 




the souvenirs indelibly printed on my 
memory is the look in the eyes of a 
man who had just realized that I 
stood between hhn and the only exit. 
He relaxed for just a second — and 
then started for the exit through what 
very nearly became my dead body, 
in the next few hectic minutes. I 
saw that look — depthless, limp, in- 
human — in Tihie’s eyes. Gently I 
disengaged my arm and stepped back. 
She resumed breathing. 

I told myself to leave her alone. 
It’s an old story. Koestler told it, 
and his girl was younger. The trouble 
was I liked the woman, and it didn’t 
help that she really was beautiful 
under those sack suits. We got close 
enough a couple of times so we even 
discussed — briefly — whether any- 
thing could be done. Her view was, 
of course, Nada. At least she had the 
taste not to suggest being friends. 
Just Nada. 

After the second of those sessions 
I sloped off with a couple of mer- 
maids from the Reflecting Pool, who 
turned out to have strange china door- 
knobs in their apartment. When the 
doorknobs got busted I came back 
to find Mrs. Peabody had put me on 
sick leave. 

“I’m sorry, Max.” 

**De nada** I told her. 

**De nada,** I told her. 

And that was how matters stood 
when Tillie went off to play with the 
alien giantesses. 

With Tillie next to them, our shop 
became Miss Government Agency of 
the moment. The reluctant trickle of 
cross-data swelled to a flood. We 
found out, for instance, abojit the po- 
lice rumors. 



It seemed the big girls wanted ex- 
ercise, and the first thing they asked 
for in any city was the big park. 
Since they strolled at eight mph, a 
foot guard wasn’t practical. The UN 
compromised on a pair of patrol cars 
bracketing them on the nearest road. 
This seemed to amuse the Capellans, 
and every now and then the police 
radios went dead. The main danger 
to the big girls was from hypothetical 
snipers, and nobody could do much 
about that. 

After they went through Berlin the 
Vapos picked up four men in poor 
condition in the Tiergarten, and the 
one who lived said something about 
the Capellans. The Vapos didn’t take 
this seriously — all four had vagran- 
cy and drug records — but they 
bucked it along anyway. Next there 
was some story from a fruity type in 
Solsdjk Park near The Hague, and 
a confused disturbance in Hong Kong 
when the Girls went through the 
Botanical Gardens. And three more 
defunct vagrants in the wilderness 
preserve outside Melbourne. The 
Capellans found the bodies and ex- 
pressed shock. Their men, they said, 
did not fight among themselves. 

Another tidbit was the Great Body 
Hunt. Try as we had in Mexico we 
had never got one look at them com- 
pletely naked. Breasts, yes — stan- 
dard human type, superior grade. 
But below the navel we failed. Now 
we found out that everybody else all 
along the route was failing too, al- 
though they’d pushed the perimeter 
pretty close. I admired their efforts 
— you wouldn’t believe what some 
of our pals had gotten pickups into. 
But nothing worked. It seemed the

Girls liked privacy, and they had 
some sort of routine snooper-swe^ 
that left blank films and tapes. Once 
when the Jap LS. got really tric^ 
th^ found their gismo with the cir- 
cuits not only fused but mirror re- 
versed. 

T lUie’s penetration evoked a mass 
howl for anatomical detail. But 
all she gave us was, ^'Conception is 
a voluntary function with them.” I 
wondered if anyone else around the 
office was hearing mice in the wood- 
work. Was I the only one who knew 
Tillie’s loyalty was under pressures 
not listed in standard agent evalua- 
tion? 

She was helpful on the big ques- 
tion: How did they come to be so 
human? There was no doubt they 
were. Although we hadn’t got pic- 
tures, we had enough assorted bio- 
logical specimens to know they and 
we were one flesh. All the Girls 
themselves had told us was interpret- 
ed as “We are an older race” — big 
smile. 

Tillie got us the details that shook 
our world. The navigator had too 
many balloon-glasses one night and 
told Tillie that Capellans had been 
here before — long before. Hence 
the chart notation they’d wanted to 
check. There was something of inter- 
est here besides a nice planet — 
something the first expedition had 
left. A colony? The navigator grinned 
and shut up. 

This tidbit really put the straw- 
berries in the fan. Was it possible we 
were the descendants of these people? 
Vertigo hit the scientific sector and 
started a babble of protest. What 



about Proconsul? What about the 
australopithecines? What about goril- 
la blood-types? What about — about 

— about WHAT? The babble mount- 
ed; a few cooler heads pointed out 
that nobody really knew where Cro- 
Magnon came from, and he had ap- 
parently interbred with other types. 
Well, it’s an old story now, but those 
were dizzy days. 

True to human form, I was giving 
the grand flip-flop of history about 
two percent of my attention. To be- 
gin with, I was busy. We were fight- 
ing out a balanced representation of 
earth scientific specialists with all 
the other nations who had delega- 
tions in the visiting party to Luna. 
It WM to be a spectacular talent show 

— everything from particle physics, 
molecular genetics, math theory, eco- 
systems down to a lad from Chile 
who combined musical notation ana- 
lysis, cosmetology and cooking. And 
every one of them handsome and cer- 
tified heterosexual. And equipped 
with enough circuitry to — well, 
assist their unaided powers of obser- 
vation. Even in the general euphoric 
haze somebody had stayed cool 
enough to reali^ the boys just might 
not get back. Quite a job to do in 
two weeks. 

But that again was background to 
a purely personal concern. The Mon- 
day before the party took off Tillie 
and the Girls came through D.C. I 
cornered her in the film vault. 

“Will you receive a message in a 
sanitized container?” 

She was picking at a bandaid over 
a shot-puncture some idiot had given 
her. (What the hell kind of immuni- 
zation did the medicos think they had 



IF 




for assignments on the moon?) One 
eye peeked at me. She knew she was 
guilty, all 

‘*You think your big playmates are 
just like yourself, only gloriously im- 
mune from rape. I wouldn’t be sur- 
prised if you weren’t thinking of 
going home with them. Right? No, 
don’t tell me, kid, I know you. But 
you don’t know them. You think you 
do, but you don’t Did you ever meet 
any American Negroes who moved 
to Kenya? Talk to one some tinie. 
And there’s another thing you haven’t 
thought about — two hundred and 
fifty thousand miles of hard vacuum. 
A quarter of a million miles away. 
The Marines can’t get you out of 
this one, baby.” 

“So?” 

“All right. I just want to get it 
through to you — assuming there is 
a human being under that silicon — 
that out here is another human being 
who’s worried sick about you. Does 
that get through? At all?” 

She gave me a long look as though 
she were trying to mike out a distant 
rider on a lonesome plain. Then her 
lashes dropped. 

The rest of the day I was busy 
with our transmitting arrangements 
from — actually — Timbuctu. The 
Russians had offered to boost the 
party up in sections in six weeks, 
but Captain Lyampka, after a few 
thoughtful compliments, had waved 
that off. They would just send down 
their cargo lighter — no trouble at 
all, if we woidd point out a conven- 
ient desert to absorb the blast Hence 
Timbuctu, and the Capellan party 
was spending the night in D.C. en 
route there. 



They were lodged in the big hotel 
complex near our office and adjoin- 
ing Rock Creek Park. That was how 
I came to find out what Capellans 
did in parks. 

I t was a damn fool thing, to traE 
them. Actually I just hung around 
the park input. About two AM I was 
sitting on a bench in the moonli^t, 
telling myself to give it up. I was 
gritty-eyed tired. When I heard them 
coming I was too late to take cover. 
It was the two J.O.’s, two beautiful 
girls in the moonlight. Two hig girls. 
Coming up fast. I stood up. 

“Good evening!” I essayed in 
Capellan. 

A ripple of delighted laughter, and 
they were towering over me. 

Feeling idiotic, I got out my ciga- 
rillos and offered them around. The 
first mate took one and sat down on 
the bench. Her eyes came level with 
mine. 

I clicked my lighter. She laughed 
and laid the cigarillo down. 1 made 
a poor job of lifting mine. There 
is a primal nightmare lurking deep 
in every man. It has to do with his 
essentid maleness. With violation 
thereof. Most of us go through life 
without getting more than a glimpse 
of it, but this situation was bringing 
black fingers right up into my throat. 
I essayed a sort of farewell bow. They 
laughed and bowed back. I had a 
clear line of exit to right rear. I took 
a step backward. 

A hand like a log fell on my 
shoulders. The navigator leaned 
down and said something in a vel- 
vety contralto. I didn’t need a trans- 
lator — I’d seen enough old flics: 



THE MOTHER SHIP 



89 




“Don’t go ’way, baby, we won’t 
hurt you.” 

My jump was fast, but those she- 
brutes were faster. The standing one 
had my head in a vise at arm’s length, 
and when I tried the standard finger- 
pull she laughed like a deep bell and 
casually broke my arm. In three 
places, it turned out later. 

The ensuing minutes are what I 
make a point of not remembering 
except when I forget not to wake 
up screaming. My next clear view 
was from the ground where I was 
discovering some nasty facts about 
Capellan physiology through a blaze 
of pain. (Ever think about being at- 
tacked by a musth vacuum cleaner?) 
My own noise was deafening me, but 
either I was yelling in two voices or 
something else was screeching and 
scrabbling around my head. In a dead 
place somewhere inside the uproar I 
associated this with Tillie, which 
didn’t make sense. Presently there 
was, blessedly, nothing . and some- 
where else, ambulance jolts and smells 
and needle-jabs. 

At some later point in daylight 
George’s face appeared around a 
mass of tapes and pulleys on a hos- 
pital bed. 

He told me Tillie had got the cap- 
tain to call off her J.O.’s (“Leave 
the kid her toy!”) Later she got a 
call through to George, and he sent 
the special squad to haul the corpse 
in to the hidey-hole for Classified 
Mistakes. (I was now very Classi- 
fied.) While he talked he was setting 
up a video so we could watch the 
Terran scientific delegation embark 
for Luna. 

Through the pulleys I saw them 



90 



— a terrific-looking group, the cream 
of Terran expertise, and most of 
them still looking human in spite of 
being about thirty per cent hardware. 
There were the dress uniforms of 
various armed services — the pair 
of Danish biologists in naval whites, 
and the Scotch radiation lad in dress 
kilts were dazzling. Myself, I had 
most faith in the Israeli gorilla in 
khaki; I had run into him once in 
Khartuum when he was taking time 
off from being a Nobel runner-up in 
laser technology. 

The bands played; the African sun 
flamed off the gold and polish; the 
all-girl Capellan freighter crew lined 
up smartly as our lads marched up 
the ramp, their heads at Capellan 
belly-button level. Going into that 
ship with them was enough minia- 
turized circuitry to map Luna and do 
a content-analysis on the Congress- 
ional Library. At the last minute, one 
of the Chicoms got the hiccups, and 
his teeth transmitted flak all over the 
screen. Tillie followed the men, and 
behind her came the captain and her 
roughnecks, smiling like The Girl 
Next Door. I wondered if the navi- 
gator was wearing any bandaids. My 
teeth had had hold of something — 
while they lasted. 

There they went, and there they 
flaked out, to a man. We next saw 
them on a transmission from the 
mother ship. There wasn’t a molecule 
of metal on them. We found out later 
they’d dozed off on the trip up, and 
waked up in the ship clean as babies, 
with healing scars on their hides. 
(The Chicoms had new teeth.) Their 
Capellan hosts acted as if it were all 
a big joke and served welcome drinks 



all around every ten minutes. Some 
drinks they must have been — I 
caught a shot of my Israeli hope. He 
was sitting on the captain’s lap, wear- 
ing her helmet. Somebody had had 
the sense to rig a monitor on the 
satellite relay, so the world at large 
saw only part of the send. They 
loved it. 

“Round one to Mordor,” said 
George, perched like a hobbit on my 
bed. He had stopped enjoying the sit- 
uation. 

“When the white man’s ship came 
to Hawaii and Tahiti,*’ I croaked 
through my squashed l^nx, “they’d 
let a herd of vahines on board for 
the sailors.” 

George looked at me curiously. He 
hadn’t had the chance to meet his 
nightmare socially, you see. I was 
getting friendly with mine, in a grim 
way. 

“If the girls had a machete or two, 
nobody got mad. They just took ’em 
away. The technologic^ differential 
here is about the same, don’t you 
think, George? We’ve just had our 
machetes taken away.” 

“They left some new diseases, too, 
when they moved on,” said George 
slowly. 

He was with it now. 

“// this bunch moves on** 

“They have to sell that ore.” 

“ — What?” (I had had a glimpse 
of Tillie on the screen, standing near 
the Capellan male we had been call- 
ing Leif Ericsson. As I had figured, 
he was about my size.) 

“I said they have to get home to 
sell their cargo.” 

And was he right. The operative 
word was cargo. 



THE MOTHER SHIP 



91 




T he plot unfolded about a week 
later when the visiting party was 
sent back from Luna, along with 
three new Capellan ratings who were 
to collect the VTO launch. To my 
inexpressible relief Tillie came with 
them. 

The cargo lighter dumped Tillie 
and our deflowered male delegation 
in North Africa and then took off 
on a paraboloid which put the Capel- 
lans down partway ’round the globe. 

“Scechuan Province, Woomara 
says,” George told me. “Doesn’t 
smell good.” The Chicoms in those 
days were speaking to us, but not 
very politely. They did not see fit 
to mention to the rest of the world 
that the Capellans were paying them 
a private visit. 

“Where’s TilHe?” 

“Being debriefed at the Veddy 
Highest Levels. Did you hear the 
mother ship unloading its ore?” 
“Where would I hear anything?” 
I wheezed, rattling my pulleys. “Give 
me that photo!” 

You could see it clearly: conical 
piles and some sort of conveyor run- 
ning out from the big hulk on Luna. 

“At least they hadn’t got matter 
transmitters,” I croaked. 

The next piece of the plot came 
through Tillie. She sat chin on fist, 
talking tiredly through her hair in the 
general direction of my kneecaps. 

“They estimate they can carry 
about 700. It’ll take them three days 
our time to unload, and another week 
to seal and atmospherize part of the 
cargo hold. The Chicoms bought the 
deal right off.” 

“What’s the difference to them?” 
I groaned. “From China the Capellan 



brand of slavery probably looks like 
cake.” 

That was it, of course. The men 
of Capella were slaves. And there 
were relatively few of them. A cargo 
of exotic human males was worth a 
good deal more than ore. A hell of 
a lot more, it seemed. On Terra we 
once called it “Black Ivory.” 

So much for Galactic super-civili- 
zation. But that wasn’t all 1 had to 
scream loud for George before he 
showed, looking white around the 
nose. 

“A merchant privateer who runs 
into a rich source of pearls, or slaves, 
or whatever,” I wheezed, “doesn’t 
figure to quit after one trip. And he 
doesn’t want his source to dry up or 
run away while he’s gone. Or learn 
to fight back. He wants it to stay 
sweet, between trips. The good cap- 
tain was quite interested in the fact 
that the Russians offered to get up 
to Luna so quickly. They could ex- 
pect us to develop a defensive capa- 
bility before they got back. What do 
they propose to do about that?” 

“This may come as a shock to 
you,” George said slowly, “but you 
aren’t the only man who’s read his- 
tory. We weren’t going to tell you 
because there’s nothing you can do 
about it, old brother, in that jungle 
gym.” 

“Go on!” 

“Mavrua — that’s the fellow you 
called Leif Ericsson — he told me,” 
put in Tillie. “They plan to turn off 
the sun a little. As they leave.” 

“A solar screen.” George’s voice 
was gray, too. “They can lay it with 
their exhaust in a couple of dozen 
orbits. It doesn’t take much, and it

IF 




should last, that is, there’s an irrever- 
sible interaction, I don’t understand 
the physics. Harry gave me the R & D 
analysis at lunch, but the waiter kept 
taking the mesons away. The point 
is, they can screen off enough solar 
energy to kick us back to the ice 
age in about ninety days. Without 
time to prepare we’ll be finished. 
Snow should start here about June. 
It won’t quit. Or melt. Most of the 
big lakes and quite a lot of ocean 
will go to ice. The survivors will be 
back in caves. Perfect for their pur- 
pose. of course — they literally put 
us on ice.” 

“What the hell is being done?” I 
squeaked. 

“Not counting the people who are 
running around cackling, there are 
two general lines. One, hit them with 
something before they do it. Two, 



undo it afterwards. And a massive 
technological research depot is being 
shipped to Columbia. So far the word 
has been held pretty close. Bound to 
leak soon, though.” 

“Hit them?” I grated. “Hit them? 
The whole U.S.-U.K.-Soviet military 
can’t scratch that VTO that’s sitting 
in theii;laps! Even if they could get 
a warhead on the mother ship, they’re 
bound to have shielding. Christ, look 
at the routine fields they use to hold 
their atomics. And they know the 
state of our art. Childish! And as for 
undoing the screen in time to save 
anything — ” 

“What do you think you’re doing? 
Max!” They were pawing at me. 

“Getting out of here .... God- 
damnit, give me a Mfe, I can’t untie 
that bastard! Let go! Nurse! WHERE 
ARE MY PANTS?”

r iey finally hauled me over to 
George’s war-room in a kind of 
mobile mummy-case and saw 1 got 
fed all the info and rumors. I kept 
telling my brain to produce. It kept 
telling me back Tilt. With the top 
men of ten nations working on it, 
what did I imagine 7 could contrib- 
ute? When I had been grunting to 
myself for a couple of hours Tillie 
and George filed in with a purpose- 
ful air. 

“‘In a bad position there is no 
good move.’ Bogoljubov. Give over, 
Max.’’ 

“In a bad position you can always 
wiggle something** I rasped. “What 
about the men, Tillie?” 

“What about them?” 

“How do they feel about the plan?” 
“Well, they don’t like it.” 

“In what way don’t they like it?” 
“The established harem favorites 
don’t like to see new girls brought 
in,” she recited and quick looked me 
in the eye. 

“Having a good time, baby?” I 
asked her gently. She looked away. 

“Okay. There’s our loose piece. 
Now, how do we wiggle it at a quar- 
ter of a million miles? . • • ^at 
about that' character Leif — Mav- 
rua?” I mused. “Isn’t he some sort of 
communications tech?” 

“He’s chief commo sergeant,” Til- 
lie said, and added slowly, “He’s 
alone on duty, sometimes.” 

“What’s he like? You were friend- 
ly with him?” 

“Yes, kind of. He’s — I don’t 
know — like queer only not queer.” 
I was holding her eye. 



“But in this situation your interests 
coincide?** I probed her hard, hard. 
The American Negro who goes to 
Kenya often discovers he is an Amer- 
ican first and a Negro second, no 
matter what they did to him in Mis- 
sissippi. George had the sense to keep 
quiet, although I doubt he ever un- 
derstood. 

She swung back her hair, slowly. 
I could see mad dreams dying in her 
eyes. 

“Yes. They do . Coincide.” 
“Think you. can talk to him?” 
“Yes.” 

“I’ll get over to Harry,” George 
jumped up, he was ahead of the play 
now.” “We’ll see what we can lash 
up. Ten days, maximum.” 

“Call the campus. I can take a 
meeting now. But get me something 
so I don’t sound like a frog’s ghost.” 
The chief we had then was all 
right. He came to me. Of course we 
had only the start of a plan, but no- 
body else had anything, and we had 
Tillie. He agreed we were nuts and 
gave us everything we needed. The 
lateral channels were laid on by 1500, 
and Jodrell Bank was to set us up. 

The waning moon came over 
Greenwich just before dawn that 
week, and we got Tillie through to 
Mavrua about midnight He was 
alone. It took her about a dozen ex- 
changes to work out agreement in 
principle. She was good with him. I 
was studying him on the monitors; 
as Tillie said, queer but not queer. 
Cleancut, muscular, good grin; go- 
nads okay. Something sapless in the 
eyes. What in hell could he do? 

The chiefs first thought had been, 
of course, sabotage.

“Stupid,” I husked to George. 
“Harem slaves don’t blow up the 
harem and themselves just to keep 
the new girls out. They wait and 
poison the new girls when they can 
get away with it. That does us no 
good.” 

“Nor do historical analogies, after 
a point.” 

“Analogic reasoning works when 
you have the right reference frame. 
We need a new one. For instance, 
look at the way the Capellans over- 
turned our psychic scenery, our view 
of ourselves as integral to this world 
.... Or look at their threat to our 
male-dominant structure. Bigger, 
more dominant women who treat our 
males as sex-slave material. Walking 
nightmares . notice that *mare?’ 
.AU ri^t — What is the exact rela- 
tionship between the Capellans and 
us? Give me that Danish report 
again.” 

T he two gorgeous Danes had at 
least gotten some biological in- 
formation between orgies. Maybe 
they were more used to them. They 
confirmed that the Capellans carried 
sex-linked differences. Capellan males 
matured to parth-normal size and 
sexual features, but the adolescent 
females went throu^ a secondary 
development spurt and emerged as 
the giantress we had seen. With the 
specialized characteristics that I had 
inadvertently become familiar with. 
And more: some milennia back a 
mutation started cropping up among 
the women — fallout from a war, 
perhaps? No answer. Whatever the 
cause, women began failing to devel- 
op. In other words, they stayed as 



earth-type normals, able to reproduce 
in what the Capellans regarded as 
immature form. 

Alarmed, the Capellan matriarch- 
ate dealt with the problem in a rela- 
tively humane way. They rounded up 
all suspected mutant lines and de- 
ported them to remote planets, of 
which Terra was one. Hence the old 
chart notation. 

Our present visitors had been ore- 
hunting at nearly maximum range 
when they decided to check on the 
semi-mytMcal colony. No one else 
ever had. 

“What about the Capellan’s own 
history?” 

“Not much. Look at that British 
sheet: ‘We have always been as we 
are.* ” 

“Isn’t that just what we thought 
about ourselves — until they land- 
edr 

George’s tired eyelids came open 
wide. 

“Are you thinking what I — ” 

“We’ve got Tillie. Mavrua prob- 
ably knows enough to bugger their 
receiver records. It wouldn’t take 
much .... What is to Tillie as a 
Capellan is to us?” 

“Bobol” put in Mrs. Peabody, 
from some ambush. 

“Bobo will do nicely,” I went on. 
“Now we work up the exact scen- 
ery — ” 

“^ut, Jesus — talk about forlorn 
chances — ” protested George. 

“Any chance beats no chance. Be- 
sides, it’s a better chance than you 
think. Some day I’ll tell you about 
irrational sex phobias, Fve had some 
unique data. Ri^t now we’ve got to 
get this perfect, that’s all. No slips.

You cook it and Fm going to vet 
every millimeter of every frame. 
Twice,” 

But I didn’t My fever went up, 
and they put me back in the cooler. 
Every now and then Tillie dropped 
in to tell me things like the ore-piles 
on Luna had quit growing, and the 
crew was evidently busy air-sealing 
the hold. How was George doing? 
Great In my more lucid moments 1 
realized George probably didn’t need 
any riding — after all, he’d trained 
on those Mongolian yak parties. 

If this were public history I’d give 
you the big drama of those nine days, 
the technical problems that got licked, 
the human foul-ups that squeaked by. 
Like the twenty-four hours in which 
the U.S. military was insisting on 
monitoring the show through a chan- 
nel that would have generated an 
echo — their scientists said no, but 
the President finally trusted ours and 
killed that. Or the uproar when we 
found out, about Day Five, that the 
French hsid independently come up 
with a scheme of their own, and were 
trying to talk privately to Mavrua — 
at a time when his Capellan chief was 
around, too. The President had to 
get the U.N. Secretary and the 
French Premiere’s mother-in-law to 
hold that. That let the cat out of the 
first bag; the high-level "push to get 
in the act began. And there was the 
persistent intrusion from our own 
Security side, who wanted to hitch 
Mavrua up to some kind of interstel- 
lar polygraph to run a check on him. 
And the discovery, at the last minute, 
of a flaw in our scanning pulse which 
would have left a fatal trace, so that 
new equipment had to be assembled 



and lofted to the satellite relay all 
one sleepless night. Oh, there was 
drama, dl right. George got quite 
familiar with the sight of the Presi- 
dent pulling on his pants. 

Or I could paint you the horror 
visions now growing in all our minds, 
of snow that never stopped, of gla- 
ciers forming and grinding down 
from the poles across the world’s ara- 
ble land. Of eight billion people ulti- 
mately trying to jam themselves into 
the shrinking, foodless equatorial belt 
Of how few would survive. A great 
and dramatic week in world history 
— during which our hero, in actud 
fact, was worrying mostly about an 
uncontrolled staph colony in his 
cracked pelvis and dreaming of drag- 
ging seals home to his igloo off Key 
West. 

“How’re your teeth, baby?” I ask- 
ed what seemed to be a soUd version 
of Tillie, swimming in the antibiotic 
fogs. I had the mad notion that her 
head had been resting on my arm 
cast. 

“Teeth. Like for chewing blubber. 
That’s what Eskimo women do.” 

She drew back primly, seeing I was 
conscious. 

“It’s getting out. Max. Some wise 
money is starting to slip South.” 

“Best stick with me, baby. I have 
a complete arctic camping outfit.” 

She put her hand on my head then. 
Nice hand. 

“Sex will get you nowhere,” I told 
her. “In times to come it’s the girls 
who can chew hides who’ll get the 
men,” 

She blew smoke in my face and 
left.

V 

O n Day Six there was a diversion. 

The Capellan party who had 
landed in China were now partying 
around the Pacific on their way to 
pick up the VTO launch in Mexico. 
Since Authority was still sitting on 
all the vital information, the new 
batch of Girls from Capella were as 
popular as ever with the public. Be- 
hind the scenes there was a hot de- 
bate in progress about how they 
could be used as hostages. To me this 
was futile — what could we get but 
promises? Meanwhile their launch 
was sitting unattended at Mexico 
City, showing no signs of the various 
cosmic can-openers we had tried. 
All the United Powers could do was 
to englobe it with guard devices and 
a mob of assorted special troops. 

On Day Six the three Girls went 
fishing off a Hawaiian atoll, in a 
catamaran. They were inshore of 
their naval escort. One of them 
yawned, said something. 

At that moment the VTO boat in 
Mexico went Whirr, let out a blast 
that incinerated a platoon of Marines 
and took off. A Jap pilot earned his 
family a pension by crashing it at 
90,000 feet with his atomic- war- 
heads aboard. As far as we could 
find out, he never even caused a 
course correction. 

It came scorching down on the 
atoll just as the girls drifted up to the 
beach. They sauntered over and were 
inside before the naval watchdogs 
got their heads out of their radar 
hoods. Two minutes later they were 
out of atmosphere. So much for the 
great hostage plan. 



After this I kept dreaming it was 
getting colder. On Day Seven I 
thought I saw rhododendron leaves 
outside my window hanging straight 
down, which they do at 46 Fahren- 
heit Mrs. Peabody had to come over 
to tell me the ship was still on Luna, 
and it was 82° outsid^ 

Day Nine was it. fiiey rolled me 
over to George’s projection room for 
the show. We had one of the two 
slave-screens, the U.N. had the other. 
The Chief hadn’t wanted that — 
partly from the risk of detection, but 
mostly because it was ninety-nine to 
one die thing would bomb out. But 
too many nations knew we were try- 
ing something. 

I was late, due to a flat tire on my 
motorized coffin. George’s master- 
piece was already running when they 
wedged me through the doors. In the 
dimness I could make out the Chief 
up front, with a few cabinet-type 
sachems and the President. The rest 
seemed to be just two-feather Indians 
like me. I guess the President wanted 
to be in his own family when it 
bombed. 

The screen show was pretty im- 
pressive. A big Capellan hunched 
over her console, sweat streaming 
down her face, yelling a low steely 
contralto into her mike. I couldn’t 
get the words, but I picked up the 
repetitive cadence. The screen flick- 
ered — George had worked some 
authentic interstellar noise into the 
send — and then it jumped a bit, like 
an early flic, when the ship goes 
down with Pearl White lashed to a 
bunk. There were intermittent back- 
ground crashes, getting louder, and 
one cut-off screech. 



THE MOTHER SHIP 



97 




Then the back wall started to 
quake, and the door went out in a 
laser flare. Something huge kicked 
it all the way down, and Bobo came 
in. 

O h my aunt, he was beautiful. Bo- 
bo Updyke, the sweetest monster 
I’ve known. I heard a chair squeak 
beside me, and there he was beam- 
ing at his image on the screen. They’d 
fixed him up with love. Nothing 
crude — just a bit more browridge 
on what he had, and the terrible 
great paws very clean. The uniform 
— a little raw Mau-Mau on a solid 
base of mechanized S.S. schrechlich- 
heit. Somebody had done something 
artfully inhuman about the eyes, too. 
For an instant he just stood there. 
The crashes quit, like held breath. 

There’s rape and rape, you know. 
Most rape has some kind of warmth 
in it, some kind of acknowledgment 
of the victim’s existence. That’s why 
most women aren’t really scared of 
it. But there’s another kind. The kind 
a machine might do, or a golem, or 
a torture device. The kind that is 
done by a thing to a thing. That’s 
what they’d put into Bobo, and that’s 
what the Capellan on the screen turn- 
ed up her face to look at. All sweet 
Auschwitz. 

Did I say Bobo is seven feet two 
plus his helmet which brushed the 
ceiling, and Tillie is not quite five 
feet? It was something to see. He put 
out one huge hand. (I heard that 
footage was reshot twenty-two times.) 
His other hand was coming toward 
the camera. More backgroimd crash. 
The last you saw between Bobo’s on- 
coming fingers was her uniform start- 



ing to rip and more hulking bodies 
beyond ttie open door. Blackness — 
a broken shriek and a male, well, 
noise. The sound went dead. 

Our lights came on. Bobo giggled 
faintly. People were getting up. I 
saw Tillie before the crowd covered 
her. She had some blue gook on her 
eyelids, and her hair was combed. I 
decided I’d give her a break on the 
blubber-chewing. 

People moved around, but the ten- 
sion didn’t break. There was nothing 
to do but wait. In one comer was 
Harry with a console. Somebody 
brought in coffee; somebody else 
brought something in a napkin that 
gurgled into the chief’s dixie cups. 
There was a little low talk that stop- 
ped whenever Harry twitched. 

The world knows what happened, 
of course. They didn’t even stop for 
f their ore. It was 74 minutes later that 
Harry’s read-outs began to purr 
softly. 

Up on Luna, power was being 
used to close airlocks, shift busbars. 
Generators were running up. The 
great sensitive ears yearning at them 
from the Bank quivered. At minute 
82.5 the dials started to swing. The 
big ship was moving. It floated off 
its dock in the Alps, drifted briefly 
in an expanding orbit, and then Har- 
ry’s board went wild as it kicked it- 
self outward. Toward Pluto. 

“Roughly one hundred and seven- 
ty-nine degrees from the direction of 
Capella,” said George, as they rolled 
me out. “If they took Harry’s advice, 
they’re working their way home via 
the Magellanic Clouds.” 

Next day we got the electronic 
snow as they went into space drive.

IF 




To leave us, we may hope, for an- 
other couple of milleimia. 

The official confirmation of their 
trajectory came on the day they let 
me try walking. (I told you this was 
history as I lived it.) I walked out 
of the front door, over a chorus of 
yelps. TlUie came along to help. We 
never did refer to precisely what it 
was that made her able to grip my 
waist and let me lean on her shoulder. 
Or why we were suddenly in Ma- 
gnider’s buying steak and stuff to 
take to my place. Sbe was distrustful 
of my claim to own garlic, and in- 
sisted on buying fresh. The closest 
we came — then or ever — to an 
explanation was over the avocado 
counter. 

‘‘It’s all relative, isn’t it?” she said 
to the avocadoes. 

"It is indeed,” I replied. 

A nd really, that was it. If the Capel- 
lans could bring us the news that 
we were inferior mutations, some- 
body could bring them the word that 
they were inferior mutations. If they 
had women bigger and hairier than 
sur men, somebody else could have 



men bigger and hairier than they. If 
Mama could come back and surprise*^ 
her runt relations. Papa could appear 
and surprise Mama. 

— Always provided that you had 
a half-pint female who could look and 
talk like a Capellan for seven minutes 
of tape, and a big guy who could im- 
personate a walking nightmare, and 
one disaffected alien to juggle fre- 
quencies so a transmission from a 
nearby planet came through as a send 
from home base. And a pop genius 
like George to screen the last stand 
of the brave Capellan HQ officer, 
sticking to her mike to warn all 
ships to save themselves from the 
horror overwhelming the home planet 
.... It had been Harry’s touch to 
add that the invaders had long-range 
ship detector sweeps out and ordering 
all ships to scatter to the ends of the 
Galaxy. 

So, all things^ being potentially rela- 
tive, everybody down to Mrs. Pea- 
body got a medal from bringing Papa 
home. And my mama came home 
with me, although I still don’t know 
how she is on chewing blubber.

HOUSE OF 
ANCESTORS 



by GENE WOLFE 




I 

T he eye of the telescope looked 
upward giddy miles to where the 
last sphere, its sides pierced with 
yawning holes, swayed above the city. 
A teacher from Baton Rouge had 
paid her quarter, looked, and left, 
a moment before. A man from Des 



Moines would come soon, but he 
would be too late. For a few sec-* 
onds a figure stood at one of those 
holes; then another who struggled 
with him; then both were gone. 

The subway rocked and jerked in 
the malicious way subways have on 
Sunday afternoons, when the rocking 



101 






and jerking are out of harmony with 
the mood of the time and the people 
on the trains, people crossing the city 
te visit relatives or seek the cool of 
the ocean. The motion did not seem 
to bother Bonnie, who sat with her 
hands upon the purse in her lap with 
her arms enclosing protectively and 
possessively the scarcely noticeable 
swelling. 

Bonnie was pregnant. That made 
all the difference, as Joe told him- 
self. Bonnie was pregnant 

She was a tall, rather lanky girl, 
colored Scotch-Irish around her red 
flushed elbows and hands. She wore 
a black maternity skirt with a hole 
for the belly in front — it had been 
lent her by her brother Chuck’s wife 
— and a voluminous blue smock like 
the uniform of one of those semi- 
public institutions whose inmates are 
issued clothing that does not seem 
to be a uniform until two of them 
are seen together. Joe was Irish- 
Italian, darker than she, with big 
hands and forearms. 

A group of men on the far side 
of the car stared for a hioment at 
Bonnie, and he glowered at them. He 
wanted to ask them what the hell 
they thought they were looking at, 
but he knew Bonnie would be upset. 
He embarrassed her too often any- 
way, too often for him to do it 
when he could see it coming. Be- 
sides, someone might get really tough, 
and Bonnie would become fri^ened 
for him and cry, sniveling and chok- 
ing with shame as she wept because 
it had been a crime to cry in Bonnie’s 
family. For himself he did not care 
if someone did get tough. Not that 
he wanted to die. 



‘T think it’s the next stop after 
this,” Bonnie said above the clatter. 
It was the first time she had spoken 
since they had boarded the train. Joe 
nodded. ' 

He would be glad to get out. He 
had seldom been outside New York 
before, and the few occasions when 
be had were associated in his mind 
with pleasure, with sunny skies and 
fragrant winds, those one-day trips on 
which someone brought a portable 
television so that they would not be 
bereft of the familiar computer-writ- 
ten jokes, and someone else his 
friends and the friends of his friends 
so that the reassurance of the crowd 
was with them too. He played soft- 
ball in the hi^ grass of meadows 
and enjoyed it much mcnre than the 
semi-pro which had occujned his 
weekday evenings since he quit night 
school. 

“Come on.” Bonnie was puUing 
at his shoulder. “This is our stop. 
You feel all right? It doesn’t hurt?” 

He stood up, his broad body almost 
filling the narrow subway aisle, then 
waited for her to stand too. The 
train bumped to a stop. 

At the gate of the fair grounds 
Bonnie showed the pass Chuck had 
given her, telling the guard a lot 
more about Chuck’s job selling for 
the plastics company and what his 
connection was with the fair than the 
guard wanted to know. Joe stood 
back away from them, looking up at 
the entrance arch wit h its twenty- 
foot letters that read NEW YORK 
WORLD’S FAIR ’91. It was big as 
hell, but you could see The Thing 
on past it, and The Thing made it 
seem small. 



102 



IF 




(M course The Thing made every- 
thing seem small. He had not been 
up there to see, because the elevator 
didn’t go that liigh and he was sup- 
posed to stay away from steps, but 
they said you could even see The 
Thing from the roof of the buildings 
where he and Bonnie lived, way over 
in Yonkers. It was far higher than 
the Empire State building. 

Finally Bonnie quit talking to the 
guard, and he let them through the 
gate. “Where’d Chuck say he was 
going to meet us?” Joe asked. Even 
though he was curious to see the in- 
side of The Thing — especially to 
see it now, before the public was ad- 
mitted, before any of the people they 
knew had seen it — he found him- 
self hoping Bonnie’s brother would 
not be there. 

“At Howard Johnson’s right at the 
foot of it. They’ve got that opened 
up already so the people working 
on the pavilions from the different 
countries can eat there, and the re- 
porters.” He was walking a pace be- 
hind her, and Bonnie looking at him 
seriously over her shoulder said, “You 
didn’t really want to come, did you, 
Joe?” 

“Sure I did. I was going crazy 
sitting around the apartment all day.” 

Bonnie pursed her lips, turning to 
look up at him and seeming to un- 
derstand everything with her blue 
eyes. “I know you were. But you feel 
bad about Chuck. Envious.” 

He said, “No.” But it was true. 

She waited for him to catch up 
to her and took his hand. “I just 
want to tell you that I’m not mad 
because of it. Chuck isn’t either. We 
understand.” 



Joe said nothing after that, just 
looking up at The Thing as they 
walked along. Thousands upon thou- 
sands of colored balls linked to- 
gether with slender looking tubu- 
lar stems he knew were really big 
enough to hold moving belts that 
would carry sightseers from ball to 
ball. Although there was no wind 
down here on the ground it was 
blowing hard high up. You could 
see the top of The Thing lean 
away from the wind. The engineers 
said (Joe had read it in Time) 
that even a hurricane couldn’t knock 
it down, but it looked as though it 
were about to go as he watched. He 
wondered what it would be like to be 
up in it with the wind blowing 
it like that. 

C huck was waiting for them it 
front of Howard Johnson’s 
jingling the change in his pocket as 
he stood there, the way he always 
did. Chuck was ten years older than 
Bonnie. He had been selling those 
plastics ever since he got out of 
school. Two years ago, when the fair 
was just in the planning stage, he 
had landed the contract for the stuff 
that went into The Thing, and since 
then he had it knocked. The com- 
missions were making him rich; you 
could see it and not just from the 
clothes he wore. It was in the way 
he stood, and the way he wore his 
hat. That was a hat that said: I’ve 
got it made. I’m big time, and you’d 
better believe it. 

Chuck grinned big at him and 
shook his hand with his own soft one 
in that up-and-down way he had un- 
til Joe mashed it a little to see him

wince. Joe’s own hands had been 
getting soft during the months since 
the accident, but there were still 
firm and not flabby like Chuck’s. 
He swore to himself he’d never let 
them get that way, either; he’d find 
something he could do, even if it was 
only wood carving or something silly 
like that. 

“Come on in,” Chuck said when 
Joe had let go of his hand. “Ed Bak- 
er — he’s the guy I told you about, 
the chief engineer — is waiting in 
there already. I just stepped outside 
to look for you.” 

The engineer rose when Bonnie 
came to the table. He was a tall, 
man, thin as a rake, with a sharp 
“V” of hair beginning to gray at the 
sides. Chuck introduced both of 
them, Bonnie first, and beckoned to 
one of the uniformed girls who were 
waiting on the tables. 

“Chuck here says you people’d 
like to see the inside of The Thing.” 
Baker had a noticeable New Engird 
twang. “And if you would, now’s the 
time to do it They’ve sold tickets for 
six months in advance already.” 

“Is it finished?” Bonnie asked 
timidly. 

Chuck lauded. “Not quite inside, 
sir. But it won’t come down with you 
in it, if that’s what you mean. Fin- 
ishing up the displays is Ed’s job, 
though. And believe me, he can 
make the ones that aren’t complete 
more interesting than the stuff near 
the bottom that’s ready to rolL” 

“There aren’t any steps, are 
there?’* Bonnie looked at Joe, and he 
wanted to sink into the floor. He 
knew what was coming. 

Baker shook his head. “All the 



rises are by belt Does your husband 
have a heart condition? Chuck men- 
tioned something.” 

Bonnie’s brother held his fingers 
an impossible distance apart. “He’s 
got a nail in his heart this big. A 
great big galvanized nait” 

B aker’s eyebrows went up, and Joe 
said quickly, “It’s only five- 
eighths of an inch long, really. From 
a spiking gun — one of those tools 
that shoot a shell like a .22 so that 
you can nail furring strips onto con- 
crete.” 

“But it’s in your heart?” the en- 
gineer was h^f astonished, half 
skepticaL 

“In one of the chambers. The doc- 
tor told me the name of it, but I 
forget now.” 

“My God, what happened?” 

“You know how you got to push 
the barrel against someth^ and pull 
the trigger at the same time to make 
it go off?” 

Baker nodded. “I’ve used them; 
they’re practically foolproof.” 

“Yeah. Well, this guy at work was 
fooling around with one. I guess he 
must have had his finger on the trig- 
ger, and he bumped the end against 
a steel / beam.” 

Chuck broke in: “It wasn’t square 
against it, you see, Ed. Kind of at 
a slant So the spike caromed off the 
beam and hit Joe. The doctor told 
Bonnie it happens with bullets once 
in a while, especially small ones like 
maybe buckshot. They can go right 
through the wall of a man’s heart — 
just puncture it — and stay there. 
But without killing him. The heart 
heals up behind them.”

Baker picked up one of the cups 
of coffee the waitress was handing 
around, and although his hand was 
steady Joe could see that he was 
shaken. “They can’t get it out?” 

“He won’t let them,” Bonnie said. 
“I’ve begged him.” 

“Listen,” Joe told them, “I don’t 
like to go over all this again. Let me 
say my piece now, and then l^t’s shut 
up about it and talk about The Thing. 
That’s what we came here for.” 

“You don’t have to — ” Baker 
began, but Joe interrupted him with 
a gesture. 

“Like I’ve explained to Bonnie a 
thousand times — ” he was address- 
ing the engineer alone now — *1 
haven’t got a lot of life insurance, 
just what the union gives everybody. 
And if they take it out it’ll have to 
be what they call open heart surgery, 
where the chances aren’t so good. 
This way, as long as I’m alive I 
draw workman’s compensation, and 
medical benefits and all that kind of 
stuff. If I drop over some day Bon- 
nie’ll get the insurance anyway, so 
then she won’t be no worse off. Now 
tell us about The Thing, huh? 
What’s it supposed to be, anyway?” 
“Oh, you know.” Bonnie seemed to 
be as relieved as he was at the 
change of the subject. “You read to 
me about it out of the paper.” 
“Sure,” Joe said, “but I want to 
hear from an expert. The papers al- 
ways get something wrong. What is 
it, Mr. Baker?” 

“You’d need a biochemist to real- 
ly tell you. I can only repeat the 
same things you’ve already read; that 
it’s actually a giant model of a mole- 
cule of deoxyribonucleic acid — what 



we call DNA for short. It’s the stuff 
genes are made of, so in the funda- 
mental sense it’s what determines that 
each of us has the heredity he has.” 
Bonnie asked, “And it looks like 
that?” She was staring but the win- 
dow toward the base of The Thing. 

“Somewhat like that. We’ve fol- 
lowed the normal conventions for 
making a molecular model, of course. 
Those balls, as the public calls them, 
represent atoms in the model, al- 
though each one is actually a hollow 
sphere thirty yards in diameter. The 
black ones are carbon, the light blue 
ones oxygen, and so on.” 

The engineer’s interest in his work 
was infectious. Joe asked, “But it 
really does have that crazy shape? 
All the DNA in the world?” 

Chuck snorted. “If all the DNA 
had the same shape, everybody’d be 
the same, Joe. Ed, you’ve got to ex- 
cuse him; Joe’s not too technically 
oriented.” 

44Tt does all have that general dou- 
X ble helix construction,” Baker 
said stiffly, “and it’s incorrect to 
think that a single molecule of DNA 
like the one we’ve modeled here de- 
termines its owner’s complete heredi- 
ty. It takes the entire set of human 
chromosomes to do that. The DNA 
molecule only determines the makeup 
of a single type of cell, although even 
so its structure seems to be minutely 
different for each person. Only iden- 
tical twins can readily accept tissue 
grafts from one another, so one in- 
dividual’s cells must be subtly differ- 
ent from another’s — even though 
the grafts are from corresponding 
parts of the body, liver tissue. 



HOUSE OF ANCESTORS 



105 




“Well, what kind af a cell would 
this make?” Bonnie asked. “And who 
is it from?” ^ 

Baker shrugged. ‘This is just a 
typical human DNA molecide, as 
far as I know. I’m only an electrical 
engineer and Tm not sure even a 
Ph.D. Wochemist could tell you what 
sort of a cell would contain it from 
looking at it.” 

“It could be a brain cell,” Joe said 
unexpectedly, and the other three 
stared at him. 

“It could be,” Baker agreed after 
a moment’s pause. “It would be 
strange, wouldn’t it, if there actually 
were someone who had that exact 
pattern.” 

Chuck said airily, “The odds are 
probably a million to one against it.” 
“I know, but suppose someone 
did.” Baker seemed to be talking 
half to himself. “Would the molecule 
itself recognize its own structure the 
way that a set of cell transducers 
read the history of gene structure? 
There must be a logic to the geometry 
we are completely incapable of rec- 
ognizing; but it is the logic that makes 
all life possible, and the human race 
only stays alive because it’s capable 
of duplicating itself endlessly — ” 
‘Tell them how big The Thing is, 
really,” Chuck demanded. “Three 
hundred thousand million to one, 
that’s the scale this thing here is 
built to, Bonnie. It’s the biggest model 
of an3rthing ever built, and the tallest 
building in the world at the same 
time. And do you know what it is 
that makes something like this pos- 
sible?” 

“Yes,” Joe said. “Glass fibers.” 
Chuck was only slightly crestfall- 



en. “That’s right, what we call mon- 
omolecular strands. They’re only one 
molecule thick, stronger than hell» 
and we embed them in high strength 
resin — really key them in. Every one 
of those balls was made out of two 
bowls from the same mold, fitted to- 
gether, and the tubes that connect 
them were extruded and cut off to 
length. After that all they had to do 
was hang them up there after they’d 
installed the partition floors that cut 
the top half of the ball that you see 
off from the bottom half where the 
machinery is.” 

Baker seemed embarrassed by 
Chuck’s exuberance, but he nodded 
verification. “We didn’t even use a 
scaffold. Just picked up the pieces 
with helicopters and fitted them into 
place. I suppose you saw it on tele- 
vision.” 

“And you’ve got displays inside all 
of them?” Bonnie asked. “That’s 
what I want to hear about.” 

The engineer smiled. “Fm glad you 
do, because it’s the displays and the 
analytical circuits, not the structure, 
that are really my responsibility. The 
civil engineering boys have done 
their job and left. They only come 
back to read their strain gauges ev- 
ery once in a while.” 

Joe scarcely listened while Baker 
explained the displays. His attention 
was somewhat in his chest, in the area 
just beneath his breastbone, where a 
strange tightness had gripped him. He 
remembered the X-rays he had been 
shown; the spike moving, tumbling in 
the current of his blood, with each 
beat of his heart. The doctors had 
said that if it lodged in a valve. 

“Come on.”

IF 




Suddenly they were all standing 
up> pushing back their chairs and 
setting down their coffee cups. He 
rose too» feeling a little confused. 
There was no point in making a .fuss; 
he would simply have to go on be- 
having normally until he fell over on 
his face, if that were what he was go- 
ing to do. 

Outside the engineer led them to 
the foot of The Thing. 

J oe stood a little behind the others, 
his head thrown back to stare 
up at the dizzily swaying top thou- 
sands of feet above him. A droning 
little business jet of an airplane went 
past. It was only a tiny silver cross 
against the sky, but the lacework of 
The Thing towered over it like a 
thunderhead. With dizzied eyes he 
tried to follow the complexities of the 
spiraling pattern, becoming more cer- 
tain as he did that some secret of 
colossal importance was contained 
in it. 

Bonnie was touching his elbow; he 
looked down at her at last, the earth 
rocking under his feet. “What’s the 
matter?” he asked. The entrance to 
The Thing was still shut. 

“Something’s wrong with the door. 
Mr. Baker’s key won’t make it work.” 
Baker said, “Come along, and we’ll 
go to the shop and get someone who 
can open this up for us. It’s at the 
back of the grounds.” 

Joe took a step forward as Bon- 
nie released his elbow, then stopped, 
afraid he was going to lose his bal- 
ance. The vertigo which had seized 
him while he was staring upward re- 
quired a few seconds to subside. Bon- 
nie and Chuck were leaving him. 



trailing after Baker. None of them 
looked back to see if he were coming 
too. 

Half in anger, half to have some- 
thing against which to steady himself, 
he went over to the big door instead 
of following them. It was massive, 
impressive and somber. He grasped 
the handle and pulled back. 

He was a big man, owning the 
strength that comes of hard physical 
work done every day, and the acci- 
dent had done nothing to change that. 
The door gave almost imperceptibly. 
He pulled harder, throwing his weight 
backwards. The door rasped a quarter 
inch more, then suddenly gave free. 
“Stuck,** he muttered to himself. 

He looked at his wife’s back; she 
was almost out of shouting distance 
now. For half a second he thought 
of hurrying after her, then decided 
against it. Let them all walk to wher- 
ever it was they were going, and 
back. He would make his own in- 
spection of The Thing — the lower 
levels at least — and be ready to 
laugh at them when they returned. 

T he base chamber was dark until 
he entered it. Then the lights 
came up slowly like the illumination 
in a theater. No doubt in coming 
through the doorway he had stepped 
on a pressure-sensitive plate or inter- 
rupted a photocell beam. A man in a 
white laboratory smock stepped for- 
ward smiling a greeting, and it was 
an instant before Joe realized that 
the man was an automaton activated, 
like the lights, by his entry. 

“Good day, sir,” the robot began. 
“Are you interested in a guided tour 
of the exhibit in this atom?” 



HOUSE OF ANCESTORS 



107 




“Sure. That’s what 1 came for.” It 
was amusing to address the mechan- 
ical toy as though it were in fact a 
human being. 

“I will be delighted to show you 
around. I will form my next tour in 
two minutes.” 

“Why can’t we start now?” 

The robot shook his head regret- 
fully. “My programming requires a 
two-minute wait for others who 
might wish to join us.” 

“Okay.” Joe shrugged, grinning. 
“You don’t mind if I look around a 
little on my own while you’re wait- 
ing, do you? Nobody’s really going to 
come anyway, you know.” 

“There is always that possibility,” 
the mechanical guide admitted diplo- 
matically. “In the meantime you have 
the freedom of the exhibit.” 

Joe left him standing, still smiling, 
by the entrance — apparently ob- 
livious to the fact that Joe had closed 
it behind him. 

Most of the material on display 
in this chamber of The Thing was in 
the form of 3D projections — ob- 
jects solid and real to the eye but in- 
substantial. Mutated fruit flies, mag- 
nified a hundred times, crawled about 
a section of the floor. He found him- 
self wanting to kick them away when 
they approached his legs and he went 
past them without bothering to read 
the printed explanations of their gro- 
tesque abnormalities that floated in 
the air above them. 

Beyond the fruit flies an experi- 
ment still more bizarre claimed his 
attention. An egg, palely translucent, 
stood upright on its large end. The 
small end was two feet higher than 
his head, and the yolk could be seen 



through the shell — a golden gjobe 
showing a single dark speck. As he 
watched the speck grew, developed 
a head, wings and legs. It seemed to 
writhe with the energy of its thrust 
toward being. Behind him the robot 
said, “My tour is ready to form, 
sir. Would you care to go back to 
the flies, or shall we begin here?” 

Joe said a little sarcastically, 
“Where’s all the other people on this 
tour?” 

“There are no others,” the robot 
replied in an unruffled voice. “If you 
are expecting friends or members of 
your family to join you I will be 
happy to wait until they arrive.” 

“They won’t be along for a while 
yet,” Joe told him. “I think I’ll go 
ahead without them.” He was still 
staring at the growing chick, now 
nearly ready to burst from its shell. 

iC'^his display,” the robot said 
JL chattily, “shows a White Leg- 
horn egg in incubation; the unfolding 
of the miracle of life. It is designed 
to illustrate the sequence of altera- 
tions every embryo undergoes be- 
fore the final form is realized. The 
old naturalists used to say that every 
creature had to climb its own family 
tree to qualify for the privilege of 
birth, and although we are no longer 
accustomed to employ such quaint 
phrases the old tag illuminates a 
truth.” 

The chick was scratching weakly at 
the shell with its egg tooth. Joe took 
his eyes from it long enough to glance 
at the guide. “What do you mean, 
climb his family tree?** 

“He goes briefly through the forms 
of each of his forebears — ”

IF 




“His father was a chicken, wasn’t 
he? And he’s a chicken too. How 
could you tell whether he looks like 
his father or not?’’ 

“That’s not what is meant — ” 
the robot began. 

“I know darn well it’s not what 
you meant,” Joe told him irritably. 
“You meant this chicken here goes 
up through evolution from just one 
little blob like a germ. So why 
couldn’t you say so instead of all that 
junk about family trees? If that was 
true it would mean everybody has 
their father and grandfather and all 
that inside them. You know what the 
trouble with you and all those smart 
guys that set you up is? You think 
that anybody that went to college is 
so stupid they’ve got to have every- 
thing explained to them like a little 
kid.” 

“I’m sorry, sir,” the robot said. 
“But it is interesting to consider that 
since each of us receives half his 
genetic structure from each par- 
ent — ” 

“Oh, shut up.” 

The chick had broken the shell 
now and was struggling through the 
hole it had created. The robot re- 
mained obediently silent, and for a 
few seconds Joe watched it without 
speaking. Then he asked abruptly, 
“Where’s the horn on its legs?” 
“Sir?” 

“I said, where’s the horn on its 
legs. You said it was a Leghorn 
chicken and I’ll bet you don’t know 
why it’s called that.” 

There was a barely perceptible hes- 
itation before the robot replied, “No, 
I don’t sir. 1 fmd the information is 
not in my memory banks. Please rest 



assured that your question had been 
recorded, and that the answer will be 
supplied to my program as part of 
the next reprogramming session.” 

“I can tell you right now,” Joe 
said sourly. “Leghorn’s a place in It- 
aly. That’s where they got this kind 
of chicken from.” 

The chick, its magnified image as 
tall as an ostrich, was struggling to 
its feet. The robot said nothing. 

“Here’s some more for you, smart 
guy. Who was the King of the Cow- 
boys on the (Ad TV movies, huh? 
And what year was it the Mets iRrst 
won the pennant? Where was Grand 
Central before they tore it down?” 
The robot hesitated again, then 
said, “I’m afraid the answers to none 
of your questions are in my memory 
baiis, sir. Would you like to sec the 
other exhibits in this atom?” 

Joe was walking away, “No.” 

“In that case, sir, the entrance to 
the pedestrian conveyor which will 
take you to the next atom on the 
regular tour is on your right. If you 
wish to leave the complex entirely, 
you may use the door by which you 
entered.” 

“Does the next place have an- 
other dummy like you in it?” 

“Oh, no, sir. Each atom has a 
completely different guide.” 

Not certain why he did it, Joe 
turned to his right and stepped onto 
the silently moving belt. 

IV 

T he upward angle was even steep- 
er than he had expected, but 
the surface of the belt was ribbed 
with ridges almost like steps. The

lights of the chamber behind him 
faded until he was left in near dark- 
ness. It reminded him of the Tunnel 
of Love at Coney Island, where he 
had gone once with Bonnie before 
they were married. Her perfume had 
seemed intensified in the dark until 
it was all around him, and in the 
boat ahead another couple, a boy 
rad a girl he had not noticed particu- 
larly when they had gotten in, had 
made little animal sounds like chip- 
munks mating. Nothing had mattered 
then. Both Bonnie and he had be- 
lieved that in spite of everything he 
would be a success. He would go to 
night school, take a Saturday job. • . 
And nothing, nothing at all, had 
worked out as they had planned. 

Ahead of him light grew; not 
merely because he was approaching 
it, but as in the chamber below be- 
cause the voltage was being turned 
on gradually. He could make out the 
displays in the area immediately in 
front of the end of the connecting 
tube now, and a flicker of motion be- 
yond them. He stepped off the belt. 

An elderly man came forward to 
greet him. He wore a black cassock 
and a Roman collar. **Good morn- 
ing, sir,” the new guide said in a 
gentle, slightly accented voice. *T am 
Father Gregor Mendel. Good morn- 
ing, madam.” 

With a start Joe turned to look 
behind him at the person the cyber- 
naut “priest” was addressing. A 
young woman, almost a girl, was 
stepping from the belt. “Hello,” (she 
had a soft voice that was somehow 
familiar,) “do you mind if I join 
your tour?” 

Joe shook his head, then remem- 



bering his manners said, “No, not at 
all.” He was looking at the girl’s 
clothing: a skirt fully eight inches 
shorter than was currently fashion- 
able, and a blouse fantastically pat- 
terned with interlaced squares. 
“Where did you come from?” he 
asked. 

The girl smiled, brushing back her 
long, straight hair. “I came in with 
you, actually. When you opened the 
door.” 

“I didn’t see you.” After a mo- 
ment he realized how hostile the flat 
statement sounded and added, “I 
mean, I’m surprised I didn’t notice 
you down below.” 

“I kept in the background. Fm 
afraid that’s rather a fault of mine.” 
The figure of Mendel made a little 
gesture of welcome. “This is nice, 
very nice. The two of you will make 
an ideal party to tour my little ex- 
hibit” 

“Wasn’t there somebody here be- 
fore us?” Joe asked. “I thought 
I saw him go out the exit over there 
just as we came in.” 

Mendel nodded. “There was, my 
son. But he did not stay. I didn’t 
even have time to speak to him.” 
Puzzled, Joe said, “I don’t see how 
he could of gotten in ahead of me.” 

T he girl tossed her head. “It 
doesn’t matter, does it?” 

“I guess not.” 

She smiled suddenly. “Do you 
know that the only one who’s for- 
mally introduced himself here is Fa- 
ther Mendel? i^though I know your 
name’s Joe — let’s say I overheard 
some people talking to you in How- 
ard Johnson’s.”

IF 




He told her his full name, adding 
unnecessarily, "Tm married.” 

‘Tm not,” the girl said, “but I’m 
engaged.” She held up her left hand 
so that he could see the ring she wore. 
“My name’s Mary Hogan.” 

He felt an unexpected warmth to- 
ward her. “That’s my mother’s maid- 
en nan^ There’s a coincidence.” 
“That’s nothing.” She was grinning 
now. “You have the same last name 
as the boy I’m engaged to.” 

Mendel cleared his throat. “I’m 
afraid my atom is one of the dullest, 
but are you ready to see it now, my 
children?” 

“What’s it about?” the girl in- 
quired. 

“My discovery of genetics. I used 
garden peas, you know, and all my 
experiments are condensed here for 
you. The idea of the designers, I sup- 
pose, is to teach the principles in the 
same way in which there were origi- 
nally discovered. I hope it is a good 
one.” 

To please the girl Joe followed the 
monk-scientist from display to dis- 
play, looking at tall and short pea 
plants and genetic charts which ap- 
peared in glowing lines in the air; 
but he could not fix his attention on 
the exhibits or Mendel’s rambling, 
accented lecture. The brief glimpse 
he had gotten of the man who had 
fled the exhibit just as he entered ex- 
erted a hypnotic attraction on his 
mind so that he found himself recre- 
ating that flicker of furtive motion 
over and over again in his imagina- 
tion while Mendel droned on. 

At last it was over, and the dimin- 
utive priest-robot made a little bow to 
them, then stood, smiling shyly. 



“That was wonderful,” the girl 
said. “A wonderful discovery.” 

“He didn’t do it,” Joe told her* 
and hated himself for saying it as 
soon as he saw the hurt in her face. 

“I know I didn’t,” the robot ad- 
mitted in its gentle voice, “but can’t 
you think of me as a sort of actor?” 

“I suppose so,” Joe mumbled. 

“I look much as the real Mendel 
did, and insofar as is pos^My my 
logic pattern has been shap^ to 
di^licate his as revealed in his works. 
Although I admit we can’t hope for 
the accuracy obtainable when the ge- 
netic pattern of one of the subject’s 
descendants is available for study. 
Thus far you two are the only audi- 
ence to whom I have lectured. But 1 
felt as proud, when I was talking to 
you a moment ago, as I would ^ve 
if the work Mendel did was really my 
own.” 

The girl whispered in Joe’s ear, 
“Ask his blessing — it will make him 
feel better.” 

Before he was fully aware of what 
he was doing he had dropped to his 
knees. He heard himself mumble, 
“Bless me. Father.” 

A n expression of bewilderment 
passed over Mendel’s face. “Are 
you Catholic, my son?” he asked. 

“Does that matter? Couldn’t you 
give me your blessing anyway?” 

“I suppose it doesn’t really,” Men- 
del said, “and no, I couldn’t.” He 
reached down and drew Joe to his 
feet again. “This is like the story,” he 
continued in his mild voice, “they 
used to tell about one of the Emperor 
Franz Josefs visits to Baden. They 
were going to perform one of theop-

eras based on Goethe’s Faust for 
hiiD, and when one of the emperor’s 
courtiers brought his little daughter 
behind the scenes in the theater she 
saw an actor dressed as the pope and 
asked for his blessing.” 

Mary Hogan asked curiously, 
“And did he bless her?” 

Mendel shook his head. “He ex- 
plained that he was only a make-be- 
lieve pope, and when she understood 
she said, ‘Then bless my doll.* Just so, 
I cannot bless this young man, my 
daughter, but I will bless you.” His 
fingers sketched a cross in the air, and 
he murmured a latin phrase. The girl 
knelt. 

When it was over the two of them 
stepped onto the belt that would take 
them to the next hemispherical room, 
and the darkness of the tube closed 
around them. “Why would he bless 
you,” Joe asked “and not me?” 
“Maybe you were too sincere about 
it.” He felt the girl’s fingers touch his 
hand. ”It was sweet though.” 

He could sense her beside him in 
the blackness; and unexpectedly, 
overwhelmingly, the certainty came to 
him that they had waited together 
like this before, that the sensation 
he now felt was familiar through 
countless repetitions. He tried to re- 
call when this might have been and 
if he had not perhaps known this ^1 
before he had met Bonnie, or before 
they had married and he had cut off 
his contacts with other women. But 
no memory of her came, and he 
found his recollection forced back- 
ward instead to a place he had nearly 
forgotten: the tenement apartment in 
which he lived with his parents 
when he was very small. 



There had been only one bedroom, 
with the double bed on one side and 
his own with the high wooden rail- 
ings on the other. An electric fflgn 
outside the window flashed blue, then 
yellow, blue, then yellow, then went 
dark. Now in the darkness he found 
himself waiting for the blue flash 
again, and the bright spark when his 
mother drew on her cigarette, just as 
he had on nights when he would 
awaken to see her waiting for his 
father to return home. 

Instead white light gleamed in 
front of them, the lights of the next 
chamber springing into life. won- 
der what this one will be,” the girl 
said, but he did not answer her. He 
was looking for the man he had 
glimpsed in the chamber below, some- 
how certain that he would be here 
too. 

He was, but he remained hidden 
until they were almost ready to get 
off the belt. 

V 

P erhaps because it was so crowded 
this exhibit seemed smaller than 
the others. Poultry cackled and 
quacked around the attenuated legs of 
a giraffe. Huge beetles climbed the 
walls and, slipping, fell back to the 
floor to wiggle and struggle before 
they could turn themselves over and 
climb again. 

Then, on the far side of the 
chamber, peering from behind a huge 
Empire wardrobe of oiled walnut 
which stood in Napoleonic grandeur 
among the animals, Joe saw the man’s 
eyes. For an instant they stared at 
him. He received an impression of 

IF 



112 




malice unfathomable. Then they were 
gone. A hunched, hurrying figure 
scuttled like one of the beetles, dart- 
ing from behind the wardrobe and 
disappearing into the darkness of the 
next exit. 

He yelled and jumped from the 
end of the steeply rising belt, wading 
through the insubstantial animals that 
surged about his feet; but as he 
reached the middle of the room the 
doors of the wardrobe flew apart 
like the doors of some Christmas toy, 
and a man with bandaged eyes step- 
ped directly into his path. They col- 
lided and went crashing to the resili- 
ent plastic floor. 

By the time he got to his feet 
again he knew it was too late. With 
the girl’s help he pulled the robot 
erect, wondering all the while, rather 
vaguely as he mi^t have wondered 
about some back page story in a 
newspaper, whether or not the exer- 
tion he had Just undergone would 
kill him. He could feel the thumping 
of his heart as clubbed blows from 
inside his chest. 

**Bon soir,** the blind robot said. 
“I am Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine 
De Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck.” 
He made a courtly bow. 

“What happened to you?” the girl 
asked suddenly. She pointed, and Joe 
saw that Lamarck’s right hand was 
missing. It seemed to have been tom 
or hacked away; the plastisol flesh 
was ragged around the amputation, 
and color-coded wires, blue and yel- 
low, dangled from the stump. 

‘T fear. Mademoiselle,” Lamarck 
murmured, “that there may be a van- 
dal in our complex.” He seemed 
ashamed of the injury that so clearly 



revealed his nature, and thrust the in- 
jured limb behind him. 

“Yes, and I almost caught him,” 
Joe said. “If you hadn’t jumped out 
of that big cabinet when you did I 
would have. What were you doing in 
there anyway?” 

*Tt is a service closet,” Lamarck 
explained. “Each atom has one, 
equipped to perform routine mainten- 
ance on the guide assigned to it and 
to make minor repairs. When the 
vandal released me I went in hoping 
to have something done about my 
hand; when I heard the three of you 
coming, however, I felt that since I 
retained sufficient functioning to per- 
form my office 1 should do so.” A tall 
wading bird, insubstantial as mist, 
flew through his body as he spoke, 
its stilt legs trailing behind it. 

44/^hree of us?” Startled, Joe 
jL glanced back at the tube from 
which he and Mary Hogan had en- 
tered. A second girl was standing near 
the end of the belt She was taller 
than Mary, but seemed even young- 
er, coltishly unsure of herself. Like 
Mary’s, her skirt ended well above 
her knees; but short blonde hair 
peeped from under her close fitting 
hat, and she carried a beaded hand- 
bag with a long strap. Looking at 
the three of them she swung it nerv- 
ously. 

“Come on,” Mary gestured to her. 
“Join the freakout We won’t put you 
down.” 

*T overheard you talking about 
someone disp^ging something in 
here.” The new glrfe voice was sKrill 
and self-conscious. “And I just want- 
ed to tell you it was not me.”

IF 




“We know who it was,” Joe said 
gruffly. “It's a man, and he’s ahead 
of us, not behind us. I’m not going 
to stay here and look at the exhibits. 
I’m going on ahead and try to get 
him.” The resolve had formed in his 
mind, so it seemed to him, as he 
spoke; but once formed and articu- 
lated he felt that it had the force of 
divine law. In his imagination he saw 
himself dying, the spike jamming his 
heart action at the very moment the 
scuttling man he had seen come from 
behind in Lamarck’s cabinet sprang 
some simple, horrible, trap that would 
leave his body mangled — and he did 
not care. 

“Wait!” the blind robot grasped 
him by the arm with his one hand. 
“If you don’t see the things here — 
if you don’t listen to what I must 
tell you about them — you will miss 
the point of all of it.” 

‘T think he should go.” The voice 
was the girl’s, shrill and insistent. 

‘1 think he should too,” Mary Ho- 
gan said. “There’s no' telling how 
much damage that thing loose up 
ahead may do.” 

“I shall ask the master computer.” 
Lamarck’s blind face looked at no 
one in particular. “Monsieur” when 
none of the programmers are here 
the master computer is the highest 
authority. Will you abide by the de- 
cision of the master computer?” 

The girl with the beaded bag said, 
“It’s the unit that controls the whole 
Thing. All of it; all the exhibits.” 
Joe wanted to shake himself free. 
He could have done it easily — tibe 
tiny servo motors which powered ro- 
bols’ actions were strong only on tele- 
vised honor dramas — but he found 



himself unable to do so. Lamarck’s 
aged face, although he knew it to be 
a plastisol mask, his sigihtless eyes and 
his intangible air of genius in defeat, 
held him. “All right,” he said at 
length. “I’ll do whatever your com- 
puter says. How do we consult it?” 
“1 can contact it from the service 
closet. Monsieur.” iLamarck released 
his arm and wheeled with uncanny 
accuracy to face the Empire ward- 
robe. The two girls watched him ex- 
pressionlessly. M soon as the doors 
had closed Joe^^bolted for die exit 
leading to the next atom. 

H e did not wait for the belt to 
carry him this time, but scram- 
bled up it. Behind him the unsteady 
tapping of high-heeled shoes told 
him that at least one of the two girls 
was following him. 

The atom into which he burst held 
Charles Darwin, but the great scien- 
tist lay tumbled on the floor, his mid- 
section a mass of smashed circuit 
elements which a Galapagos tortoise 
near him appeared to regard incuri- 
ously. Moths big as swans covered 
every wall, their wings stiffly extend- 
ed to make an incredible pattern of 
iridescent color. 

He was bending over the inert 
Darwin when something whistled past 
his head. He heard it strike the wall 
behind him and fall clattering to the 
floor as he looked up. 

The vandal was no longer hiding. 
He stood near a scale model of 
H.M.S. Beagle, his left hand grasping 
a bundle of slender rods with ragged, 
razor-sharp ends. His ri^t arm was 
drawn back as thou^ to cast a spear, 
and as Joe watched he whipped it

115 




forward; there was barely time to 
jerk himself to one side as the jagged 
sliver hurtled toward him. With a 
solid thudding sound it buried itself 
in Darwin’s chest. 

He jerked it out as he drew him- 
self erect, poised to dodge the next 
missile. It came flying at his face. 
As he ducked, the vandal leaped on- 
to the belt which would carry him 
to the next atom. 

That atom was empty a moment 
after Joe arrived, but a metal sliver 
plucked at his shirt as he jumped 
from the belt, and he saw his quarry 
disappear into the next tube. 

After that he lost count of the 
atoms through which they passed, 
and he no longer noticed what dis- 
plays they held and whether they 
were complete or not. 

The structure of The Thing was 
complex, and most of the atoms pos- 
sessed several radiating tubes so that 
the figure he was pursuing could 
easily have shaken him off. But he 
did not seem to wish to do so; and 
when Joe grew too fatigued to climb 
along the steep belts that carried them 
higher and higher he found that he 
lost no ground in the pursuit. Always, 
at the end of each tube he glimpsed 
the man running for the next belt. 
And it was always the belt which 
would loft them highest that he fi- 
nally chose. 

But as he continued the pursuit 
Joe came to realize that he also was 
followed. Behind him the sound of 
the two girls’ feet grew until it was 
the roar of a crowd, high pitched and 
quick voiced. 

At last they reached an atom which 
had no floor, and from which no 



belt led, an empty globe of fiber 
glass with gaping holes in its sides. 
He saw the man he had followed 
waiting with a metal sliver upraised 
beside the lowest of the holes, and 
only blue sky and clouds beyond. 
Behind him were the hurrying noises 
of a hundred women. 

“Go ahead,” he called. “What are 
you going to do — jump?” 

The figure silhouetted against the 
sky only stared at him dumbly. 

Upright Joe walked forward, down 
the curving inside of the sphere that 
led to the level bottom, then slowly 
up until the man he had followed all 
these thousands of feet into the air 
and he were no more than a few 
yards apart. The spearlike fragment 
of metal rod remained poised; but 
the corners of the man’s mouth drew 
down and down with each step he 
took until the yellowish skin must 
have been ready to tear under the 
strain and the mouth was drawn d^en 
to show the square white teeth. 

Then, with a gesture that was 
almost casual, the metal sliver was 
flipped into the void. With his shoul- 
der down Joe rushed forward, struck 
the man, and drew him away from 
the edge. 

The man’s resistance revived at the 
moment of contact, and for a few 
seconds he struggled desperately. He 
still held four or five pieces of 
metal similar to the one he had 
thrown away in his left hand; but 
Joe pinned it, then jerked one from 
him to drive against his throat. The 
struggling stopped. 

“\^at’s happening,” someone be- 
hind him asked. “\^at are those 
things?”

F rom the corner of an eye he saw 
the girl who had called herself 
Mary Hogan. Behind her came the 
girl with the beaded bag; then* as he 
watched, a third girl who wmre a 
skirt that reached h^ ankles. And 
behind her, some stepping agilely 
from the belt, some staggering clum- 
sily, came woman after woman. 

Many were young, and some were 
pretty and even beautifid, but others 
were neither and a few were mon- 
strou^y fat. Several wore silks, but 
most were in plain dresses not much 
better than rags. 

^‘What are those things?” Mary 
Hogan asked again. She was stand- 
ing close to his shoulder now. “What 
are you going to do?” 

“Steel construction strips he’s rip- 
ped out of something,” Joe told her. 
“And I’m going to 1^ him with this 
on^ — rip him wide open. Want to 
watch?” He pushed one jagged end 
of the piece he held against the 
other’s body. 

“Don’t!” 

Joe stared down at the impassive 
face of the man under him and 
drove the splinter tighter still; the 
face contorted under the pressure un- 
til malice blasted from it like heat 
from the top of an open crucible. 

The girl in the long skirt dropped 
to her knees beside him. “Don’t you 
know who that is?” she asked. She 
was not pretty, but somehow clean 
looking and attractive. 

-“It’s a robot.” Joe’s voice was stub- 
born, although he found himself gasp- 
ing for breath in the thin air. “An- 
other cnunmy, clanking robot; a ro- 



bot with my face. I’m going to wreck 
him.” 

“I wasn’t sure you knew who it 
was,” the girl murmured. 

“You think I don’t know my own 
face? What I’d like to know is what 
sort of dirty joke is being played 
here.” 

“I think I can tell you,” Mary 
Hogan said; she stooped b^ide the 
kneeling girl, pushing her long hair 
away from her face. “It involves who 
all of us are too. Have you guessed 
yet?” 

“You’re robots too,” Joe said bit- 
terly. “That’s why the robot pre- 
'‘tending to be a priest would bless 
you and not me. You aren’t a real 
person any more than this thing is.” 

“We’re more — I’m more than 
that. Don’t you know who I am yet?” 

He said something inaudible. 

“I couldn’t hear you.” She bent 
closer, the other women crowding 
around her. 

“You’re supposed to be my moth- 
er; my mother the way she looked 
when I was bom. My real mother is 
still alive in Brooklyn.” 

4 4 '^his is' the way I was when you 
JL were conceived,” the girl said. 
“It’s at conception that the heritage 
is passed.” 

Joe nodded. “I knew it once I’d 
thought of it. That skirt-and-blouse 
outfit of yours: mini-skirts and op- 
art prints mean ’67 or ’68. I’m twen- 
ty-four, so that puts you just about 
right, and I guess the girl with the 
bag back there is your mother, and 
this one,” he looked at the kneeling 
woman in the long skirt, “is her 
mother.”

IF 




Mary Hogan nodded. “Your 
grandmother and great grandmother, 
really; it wa$ from your cells that the 
transducers took the patterns. It used 
to be believed that only the parents’ 
own heredity could be transmitted, 
but recently we’ve discovered that La- 
marck was correct in certain respects 
— every characteristic, as it exists at 
conception, is to some extent trans- 
mitted to the new generation. That’s 
what he was supposed to explain to 
you in his atom.” 

Joe said stubbornly, “But you’re 
really a robot.” 

“Physically, yes. But mentally — 
spiritually if you will — I am a rep- 
lica of the young woman who be- 
came your mother. Tomorrow I will 
be someone else.” There was sadness 
in her voice. 

“You change?” 

“Yes; that’s the point of this entire 
complex. There are a hundred of us 
here who constitute what might be 
called a repertory company. As visi- 
tors enter the master computer reads 
a component of some randomly se- 
lected individual’s genetic heritage, 
then programs one of us as that 
person’s forebear.” 

“But over and over?” Joe looked at 
the crowd of women. “Generation 
after generation? From the same per- 
son?” 

The girl in the long skirt said, “It 
wasn’t supposed to work this way. 
But an automatic program sequence 
was installed that demands maximum 
utilization of us. With a whole crowd 
of visitors coming in each of us 
would have been assigned to a differ- 
ent one, but with only you in the 
complex. ” 



“I got read every time I went past 
a thingamajig, and they’re in all the 
tubes. I see. But what about him?” 
“He was the first one, really,” the 
girl with the beaded bag said unhap- 
pily. “Only something went hay- 
wire.” 

“Well, what went haywire? How 
does he fit into this?” 

The other girls looked at Mary 
Hogan. 

“You have a death wish. Do you 
realize that, Joe?” 

H e shook his head. “I want to 
live as much as anyone else.” 
“Consciously, yes. But not sub- 
consciously. No one who didn’t want 
to die would make up that story of 
refusing surgery for his wife’s sake.” 
“How did you know . ?” 

“I’ve been contained in your body 
all your life; there’s a carryover of in- 
formation — don’t you remember 
that I knew your name when we first 
met? In so far as I am your mother 
— and till my program is changed 
that’s very far — that carryover is all 
that holds me sane. Without it I 
would be finding myself suddenly 
here without an explanation at all.” 
Joe looked down at the man he 
held pinned. “And that’s the way you 
know about him too?” 

“Partly, and I can guess the rest. 
For a long time it’s been known that 
a person’s will to die could actually 
produce the death, and to do that 
it must affect a change in certain cell 
structures. Somehow the first time 
the tranducers tried to read your 
DNA they produced this. The master

Joe clenched his teeth. “He’ll get

“I wouldn’t do that, if I were

“Why not?” 

“Your death wish is strong now, I

He looked. The opposite end of the 
steel sliver was as sharp as the one 
with which he was threatening his 
double. It had torn his shirt and 
scratched his chest until it was cov- 
ered with his own blood. For a long 
time he stared at it.

always boom for advancement! 



T he last cars had pulled into Clark 
W. Kerr Memorial Parking Lot 
for the opening session of his new 
Physics I course, and Gleason was 
still searching frantically for the rest 
of his notes. Today of all days he 
could not afford to be late for class. 
It had taken all the pull he could 
muster to get prime time on the 
closed-circuit tv, and he’d surely be 
relegated to the early morning hours 
or even cancelled if he were late the 



monitor. He was digging hurriedly 
through the stacks of Physical Ab- 
stracts that had been delivered that 
morning, the six-foot bundle repre- 
senting summaries of all the papers 
in his field published during the pre- 
ceding week. Under one of the piles 
he found the missing pages of his 
notes and, with a relieved sigh, fitted 
them into the sheaf of papers in his 
hand. Using the camera lens as a 
mirror he smoothed down his rum- 



first day. With only one hundred and 
twenty-seven research papers to his 
name he was lucky to have made 
assistant professor anyway. 

Quarters were dropping into park- 
ing meter slots, and the air filled with 
the buzz of hungry machinery click- 
ing off the time. The big screen at 
the front of the lot lit up hopefully, 
then went dark again as Gleason, 
seated in his office a half-mile away, 
shook his head at the engineer on his 



pled hair, then nodded to the waiting 
engineer. The red light went on, and 
he saw his own owlishly bespectacled 
face staring out from the monitor. 

“The pursuit of knowledge,” he 
began, “has always been the province 
of a handful of lonely, dedicated 
men ...” 

H e felt better once class was over. 

It hadn’t gone badly at all. 
There’d been some disturbance on 



121 




the screen from a passing jet, and 
one of the filmstrips had run out be- 
fore he’d finished explaining it, but 
otherwise the show had been tech- 
nically competent. He sighed, put 
put down his notes on the desk, and 
began to burrow through the piles of 
abstracts that filled most of the small 
office. Buried in a comer he found 
a two-cup coffee maker, now empty. 
Again Gleason seethed whh the con- 
sciousness of his inferior status. As- 
sociate professors rated five-cup cof- 
fee makers and didn’t have to go 
hunting water all the time! He 
thought of borrowing the larger size 
from the office of Professor Morgan, 
who had died only yesterday, but 
decided against it since the theft 
would soon be discovered by Mor- 
gan’s successor, and it could mean 
Gleason’s job. If he wanted a cup of 
coffee there was nothing to do but 
trek to the graduate students’ lounge. 

He unearthed a chipped and black- 
ened coffee cup, shoved a pile of 
abstracts away from the door and 
ventured into the hallway of the 
physics building. A sharp hiss from 
the office to the right of his brought 
him up short. Turning he found the 
department’s other assistant professor, 
Gridley Farrington, peering out at 
him through a partially opened door. 
The other man, shorter than Gleason 
with a sharpened nose and slick, black 
hair, slipped from his office and con- 
fronted his colleague with a broad 
and strikingly insincere smile. “Off 
to the kiddies’ lounge again?” he in- 
quired, staring pointedly at Gleason’s 
cup. 

Gleason could understand Farring- 
ton’s hostility, as the poor man had

"first" writer is John Thomas, a 33-year- 
old UCLA graduate who lives in Los 
Angeles. Recently Thomas edited Film

"is published for those hardy groups who

published a scant one hundred and 
twenty-three research papers and was 
thus even lower on the multiversity 
social scale than he. Of course seven- 
teen of Gleason’s publications had 
been purchased from graduate stu- 
dents who had dropped out before 
getting their degrees, but Farrington 
wasn’t likely to have done all his own 
work either. 

“Just thought I’d get some coffee,” 
Gleason replied, waving has cup 
vaguely. “It’s a chance to keep in 
touch with the students, see what 
they’re thinking. It’s hard to get to 
know anybody teaching your courses 
over television.” 

“Oh, sure,” Farrington grinned un- 
pleasantly. “Well, Gleason,” he went 
on, turning apparently to what was 
re^ly on his mind, “what do you 
think about old Morgan dying?” 
“terrible thing,” Gleason mum- 
bled. 

“Oh, I don’t mean that! I mean 
who do you think will get his job?” 
Gleason had thought of little else 
since Morgan’s death, but he wasn’t 
going to let Farrington know that. 
“Well, I suppose there are lots of 



122 



IF 





choices. Hunnicutt could bring in a 
man from outside.” 

“Ridiculous!” Farrington snapped. 
“Silly idea! Surely they’d choose a 
faculty man, someone with an — er 
— adequate publication record.” 
“Well, probably,” Gleason admit- 
ted, shifting nervously from one foot 
to the other. He himself had been at 
the multiversity only a few months, 
a replacement in fact for Morgan, 
who had been promoted to an as- 
sociate professorship after nineteen 
years on the staff. He wasn’t familiar 
with all the nuances of departmental 
rivalries yet. 

“You’ll go for the job, I suppose,” 
Farrington ventured. 

“Well, if they offer it to me . ” 
“Oh, don’t play modest with me, 
Gleason!” The little man smoothed 
down the back of his slick hair. “If 
you want the job you’ve got to fight 
for it! Nobody can afford to wait 
for offers any more. Are you going 
to fight or not?” 

Gleason didn’t quite understand 
the implications of the question. Far- 
rington must want the job for him- 
self, but surely the four-publication 
margin would be decisive if the chair- 
man chose to recruit from his own 
staff. “Well,” Gleason said finally, 
“HI probably do whatever I can to 
get the job, if that’s what you mean.” 
Farrington smiled nastily, but at 
the same time turned rather pale. 
“That’s what I thought,” he said and 
disappeared into his office, snapping 
the door shut behind him. 

G leason shrugged and continued 
on down the corridor to the 
graduate lounge, where he found four 



anonymous^students and a luke-warm 
urn of coffee. He sipped some of the 
coffee and attempted to make con- 
versation with the students, none of 
whom appeared to see any advantage 
in talking to an assistant professor. 
The belated entrance of a fifth stu- 
dent, however, left Gleason somewhat 
less than pleased. For the boy was 
Alec Throckmorton, a shambling, 
beetle-browed graduate student of 
minimal intelligence and doubtful 
competence, whose attempts to make 
up for his lack of brilliance through 
an anxious, almost fawning desire to 
please rendered him doubly odious. 
But, since his father happened to 
supervise the awarding of grants 
through the National Science Founda- 
tion, Throckmorton was assured not 
only of his degree, but of a soft berth 
as lab assistant to the least prestigious 
member of the staff — Gleason. 

“How ya doin’, professor?” the 
boy demanded, slapping Gleason’s 
shoulder and dislodging most of the 
contents of his coffee cup. “All ready 
for the big spearmint tomorrow?” 

Gleason recalled with a chill that 
the boy was scheduled to assist him 
the following day in a critical and 
perhaps dangerous investigation into 
the properties of one of the newer 
synthetic elements. “All ready, 
Throckmorton,” he sighed. “I hope 
you can set up the equipment proper- 
ly, this time.” 

Throckmorton nodded his head 
vigorously. “Don’t worry, professor. 
Sometimes I get confused about 
where the wires go, but I’ve got it all 
straightened out now.” 

“Green wire to the red coil, re- 
member?”

“Oh — uh — yeah, I remember.” 
Before the boy could generate further 
unwelcome conversation, Gleason 
hurried away. 

After awhile he wandered back to 
his own office carrying a tin of water 
for his coffee maker. Though he had 
closed his office door on leaving it 
was now ajar, and Gleason wondered 
idly if he had missed a visitor. Pour- 
ing the water into the coffee maker 
he added some grounds from a jar in 
his desk. He plugged in the percolator 
and stepped around a stack of ab- 
stracts to get his cup. 

The explosion wasn’t very loud, 
but it was powerful enough to lift 
the abstracts and deposit them solidly 
against the small of his back. Gleason 
went down across another pile of 
papers as a fusillade of deadly frag- 
ments rattled angrily against the 
walls. In the sudden silence he sat 
up and stared at the smoking hole 
where the coffee maker had been 
sitting. 

His door flew open, and for a 
moment Farrington’s ratlike face was 
momentarily framed, an expectant 
grin fading to dismay as he saw Glea- 
son staring back at him. Then the 
face was gone, and Gleason heard 
rapid footsteps in the hallway. A few 
moments later the door again swung 
open to reveal the department chair- 
man, Professor Hunnicutt. 

“Starting sooner than I’d expect- 
ed,” was Hunnicuu’s only comment 
as he helped Gleason to his feet. 
“Bomb in the coffee maker, eh? Not 
really ingenious.” 

G leason examined the remains of 
the percolator mutely. Only the 



heavy stack of abstracts had prevent- 
ed him from being slashed by flying 
metal and glass from the explosion. 
Hunnicutt came up behind him and 
peered over his shoulder. “Looks 
like the bomb was connected to the 
heating element, went off when the 
coil started to warm up.” Hunnicutt 
shook his head disapprovingly. “Not 
really a good job. Always takes a 
few seconds for heat to get to the 
element — long enough for the in- 
tended victim to walk away from the 
bomb. A really top-notch man would 
have connected the bomb directly to 
the electrical circuit.” 

It occurred to Gleason that the 
chairman’s remarks were not entirely 
appropriate to an instance of attempt- 
ed murder. He turned to stare at his 
boss, a tall, white-haired man impec- 
cably* clothed in gray pinstripe. 
“What,” he demanded, “is going on 
here?” 

Hunnicutt slipped a fatherly arm 
about Gleason’s shoulders. “I keep 
forgetting you’re new here, my boy. 
Not really conversant with the multi- 
versity traditions.” He kicked aside 
a stack of abstracts with a well-polish- 
ed oxford. “Come up to my office 
for a few minutes. I think we can 
easily straighten this out.” 

The chaiman motioned casually to 
a bored custodian who had suddenly 
materialized and led Gleason into the 
hallway and down the long corridor 
to the left. Gleason noted that Far- 
rington’s door was tightly closed and 
that no sound issued from the sealed 
interior. 

Hunnicutt seated himself at his 
desk and leaned back comfortably, 
moving a ten-cup percolator to one 



124 



IF 




side. “Bit of a shock for you, I sup- 
pose, coining without warning and 
all Warning from me, I mean. I as- 
sume Farrington did check with you 
to make sure you wanted to compete 
before he planted the bomb.”^ 

Gleason was thoroughly disoriented 
now. Something rather unusual seem- 
ed to be going on within the walls of 
what he had come to think of as a 
rather staid multiversity. “I — I don’t 
think he really . *’ Gleason began 
and then recalled the peculiar con- 
versation with Farrington of an hour 
before. “He said something about 
fighting for the appointment . ” 

“Yes,” said Hunnicutt brusquely, 
“the appointment.” He leaned back, 
making a tent of his fingers. “Ifs a 
real problem for me. Need a really 
top-notch man for the job, if you 
know what I mean. So many Ph.D*s 
these days, so many publications, one 
can’t re^ly keep up with the qualifi- 
cations any more. Don’t want to go 
outside the present staff if 1 can help 
it. But, you know, 1 need some real 
evidence that I’ve got a top-notch 
man to fill the vacancy.” 

Gleason had a feeling that he didn’t 
completely understand the conversa- 
tion. “You know my qualifications 
...” he began. 

Hunnicutt waved him aside im- 
patiently. “Know it all; no better or 
worse than Farrington’s except for a 
small difference in the publications 
index. Really couldn’t choose on the 
basis of what I know now. Farring- 
ton’s got seniority in service, of 
course, but I never let that influence 
an appointment.” Hunnicutt’s manner 
softened a bit. “It’s ingenuity I like 
to see, my boy. Farrington’s trying 



hard, but that coffee-maker stunt isn’t 
really the sort of thing to convince 
me. The heating elem^t, you know. 
Now, I wonder if you could think of 
some better way . ” 

“Better way, sir? To do what?” 

Hunnicutt laughed nervously, 
tamping tobacco into a professorish 
pipe. “Why, to kill him, of course! 
He’s had his chance, now it’s your 
turn! If you can think of a more in- 
genious — and successful — method 
than his, you’ll not only have con- 
vinced me of your own abilities, but 
you’ll have eliminated your only de- 
partmental rival!” 

Gleason stared at his boss. “Kill 
him, sir?” 

“Well, that’s the tradition!” Hunni- 
cutt snapped with a sudden return to 
his mood of irritation. “Can’t fight 
a good college tradition, I always say. 
Besides, it’s really the only way. How 
can I tell who’s really top-notch with- 
out some kind of test?” He paused, 
reflecting. **The whole thing began 
really as a kind of accident a few 
years ago. Milton and Borofsky had 
decided to duel for the post being 
vacated by Anderson, biit Borofsky 
cheated by devising a way to assassin- 
ate Milton with the chimes in the 
college bdl tow^ even before the 
duel took place. Read it in some mys- 
tery story, I believe. Of course we 
Couldn’t turn Borof^cy over to the 
police, top-notch men being hard to 
get as they are. So I promoted him 
to the job — rather admired his 
ingenuity, as a matter of fact. 

“Well, couldn’t do much a few 
months later when Leonard electro- 
cuted Borofsky to get Blassingame’s 
job. A sort of precedent had been set,

you see. An 3 rway, that’s the way it 
grew, from small begiimings, as these 
traditions often do. Nowadays 1 
wouldn’t consider making appoint- 
ments any other way.” He was 
friendlier now, smiling an encourag- 
ing smile at Gleason. *1 think you’ve 
got the stuff it takes to carry on the 
old tradition, my boy. Farrington’s 
good, but not really my type of re- 
search man. Heating coils! Think up 
something a little better, and you 
won’t have to worry about that as- 
sociate professorship.” 

Gleason was still trying to make 
some audible comment as Hunnicutt 
ushered him briskly to the door. “To 
tell the truth,” the chairman was say- 
ing, “I’ve been a little disappointed 
in the quality of assassinations around 
the department the last year — too 
messy, too routine. Now, if you could 
come up with something really top 
notch on your first time out .... ” 
His voice dropped to a friendly con- 
fidentiality. “Well, you’d have a head 
start on a really outstanding career 
in science.” Gleason found himself 
standing in the corridor as the chair- 
man’s door si^ed shut behind him. 

He drifted back down the hallway 
and into his office, peering apprehen- 
sively at Farrington’s closed door be- 
fore he entered. The custodian had 
just finished cleaning up his office, 
and a shiny new two-cup percolator 
had already been installed in one 
comer. Gleason noted with relief 
that several bales of shredded ab- 
stracts had heen removed. 

W hat was he to do now? He 
couldn’t go along with Hunni- 
cutt’s plan — simply couldn’t! He’d 



never killed anybody in his life and 
wasn’t going to start now. Yet ap- 
parently his own life was in danger, 
and if he didn’t try some kind of 
counterattack the assistant professor- 
sffip would surely go to Farrington. 

heard vague rumors of the kind 
of cutthroat competition that had 
developed in the multiversities over 
the past decade, but he’d never an- 
ticipated anything like this. A little 
sabotage to divert government re- 
search funds — that was common 
enough. But murder! If this was the 
kind of game they were playing, he 
wanted no part of it. 

Gleason glanced at his watch and 
saw that it was almost time for his 
next class. He went over to the wall 
case and racked out the tv camera. 
Removing a sheaf of notes from his 
desk, he sat down in his chair and 
turned toward the camera; only a 
half minute to go, he noted. Sudden- 
ly he realized that he was still a mess 
from the explosion, his hair on end, 
his clothing rumpled. He looked 
about for a mirror, then remenibered 
the trick of using the camera lens 
as a last-minute mirror. He peered 
at the camera, trying to catch his 
reflection in the darkened lens. 

There was no lens; only a slim, 
blackened tube. 

Gleason sat for a moment digesting 
this fact as the clock hand crept to- 
ward the hour. The absence of a lens 
might mean several things, but only 
one occurred to him at the moment. 
He dived for the floor. 

The red light winked on, and a 
high-energy laser beam spat from the 
tube, passing just over Gleason’s 
desk and burning a hole in the wall 



126 



IF 




behind it. Overloaded circuits began 
to whine, ^d the camera burned it- 
self out within seconds, the beam 
vanishing as its power supply was cut 
off. After a few moments the top of 
Gleason’s head rose warily above the 
level of the desk, round eyes fixed 
on the smoking hulk of the television 
camera. 

The phone rang. It was Professor 
Hunnicutt. 

“What’s going on in there,*’ Hunni- 
cutt demanded between audible sucks 
on his pipe. ‘Wou’re twenty seconds 
late getting on the air! Students are 
waiting — knowledge calls, my boy!” 

“It’s Farrington, I think, sir.” 
Gleason sat down on the floor cross- 
legged, not quite ready to leave the 
shelter of his desk. “He seems to have 
installed a laser beam in my tv cam- 
era. He — he nearly burned a hole 
in meP 

“No?” came Hunnicutt’s shocked 
voice over the wire. “Used a tv 
camera, did he? That sort of Aing 
won’t do at all!” 

“No, sir,” said Gleason, brighten- 
ing. 

“No man has the right to inter- 
rupt class programming for person- 
al business,” said Hunnicutt, right- 
eous anger thundering in his voice. 
“Not a really top-notch kind of thing 
to do. Shows the sort of degeneration 
of standards in the academic com- 
munity the last few years.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“All violence must take place out- 
side class hours, committee meetings 
and conference periods,” Hunnicutt 
said firmly. “I’ll have to talk to Far- 
rington about this.” 

“Er — sir ” 



Hunnicutt’s voice rasped with im- 
patience. “Well, what is it? I’ve got 
to get back to work.” 

Still crouching, Gleason cradled 
the phone in both hands. “I — I was 
thinldng, sir. I’m not sure 1 really 
want that associate professorship 
after all. I’ve only been here a few 
months, and . ” 

“Nonsense!” Hunnicutt roared. 
“You’re a top-notch man. Want to 
see you move ahead?” 

“Yes, sir. But, you see, murder’s 
not really .... I mean, I’m not Ae 
type for this sort of thing.” 

“Whafs that?” Menace edged 
Hunnicutt’s voice. 

“What I’m trying to say is, I’m not 
really Ae type to kill someone just to 
get a job.” 

A long silence stretched across Ae 
wire. “Not the type, eh?” Hunnicutt 
sighed wearily. “I’d thought better 
of you, my boy. Really top-notch, I 
thought. Felt sure you’d come 
through.” Another silence. “You un- 
derstand, of course, that we can’t 
keep a man on the faculty who scorns 
our department’s hallowed traA- 
tions.” 

“Sir?” 

“I mean, Gleason, that you do not 
yet have tenure.” 

“No, sir.” 

“Plenty who’d like your present 
job, Gleason. And no other multi- 
versity is likely to hire you without 
a recommendation from me. Think it 
over.” The wire went dead. 

Gleason put down the phone and 
rose cautiously to his feet. He cir- 
cled the desk to peer at Ae fused 
camera, Aen turned to stare at the 
neat hole burned in the far wall of 



PUBLISH AND PERISH 



127 




his office. A peaceful grouping of 
trees and ivy could be glimpsed 
through the aperture. 

Gleason stood thinking about Hun- 
nicutt’s words» the long struggle to 
get his present job, his unfitness for 
any real work in the outside world. 
Hunnicutt was right — no other 
multiversity would hire him without 
a recommendation, and surely no one 
would believe his story if he tried to 
use it as an excuse. It was either get 
out of this situation somehow or face 
a diminishing career at some back* 
water city college, stripped of re- 
search funds and despairing of the 
future. 

S till sunk in misery, he called the 
tv studio and cancelled all classes 
for the rest of the day, since it would 
take that long for his camera to be 
replaced. Then he returned to a seri- 
ous consideration of his problem. 
What was he going to do? He 
couldn’t kill anybodyl And how could 
Farrington . ? There was a 
thought I Was it possible that Farring- 
ton was no more enthusiastic about 
murder than he? Perhaps the poor 
man had made the two attempts on 
Gleason’s life out of nothing more 
than a pathetic loyalty to his depart- 
ment. U the two of them could get 
together and make a deal .... 

A few moments later Gleason was 
knocking timidly at his neighbor’s 
door, a cautious optimism in his heart 
and a heavy paperweight in his hand 
should the optimism prove unjusti- 
fied. Gleason heard footsteps inside 
the office, then Farrington’s hoarse 
whisper at the door. “\^o’s there?” 
“Gleason! I’ve got to talk to you!” 



He heard a hasty scuffling, then 
silence. “Don’t bother to try shooting 
through the door,” Farrington’s muf- 
fled voice called finally. “I’ve got 
an energy field aroimd my desk!” 

“For God’s sake, man, I don’t 
want to hurt you. I just want to talk 
this thing over!” 

“There’s nothing to talk about,” 
Farrington snarled. “You won’t get 
me to open this door!” 

Gleason stepped to one side of the 
door in case Farrington decided to 
do some shooting himself. “Let’s be 
sensible,” he called in a stage whis- 
per. “\^y should we go along with 
this crazy scheme when the stakes 
aren’t worth it? Maybe we could work 
something out!” 

“There’s nothing to work out!” 
Farrington snapped back. “I need the 
job! If I knew how to do anything 
else I wouldn’t be a college pro- 
fessor!” 

Nervously Gleason shifted the 
paperweight from hand to hand. 
“But, look, Farrington. We must be 
able to make some kind of deal. If 
we could just talk rationally about 
this I’m sure — ” 

“There’s nothing to talk about, 
and even if there were . ...” A sud- 
den, protracted silence fell. Gleason 
eased up to the door and put his ear 
against the panelling. He thought he 
could hear the faint sounds of hur- 
ried movement inside. “On second 
thought,” Farrington went on, “you 
may be right. At least we can talk it 
over. Come on inside, and let’s dis- 
cuss it.” 

Gleason straightened, shifted the 
paperweight to his left hand and 
reached for the doorknob. He froze 



128 



IF 




m that attitude, reflecting. After a 
few moments he ventured, “Maybe 
you’d better come out here instead, 
Farrington. The — er — light’s bet- 
ter.” 

**No,” Farrington’s distant voice 
replied, “you come in here. We want 
to keep this private.” 

“We can have some coffee in the 
lounge.” 

“I’ve got a coffee maker in here.” 

‘T think you’d better come out 
here.” 

A half-hour later Gleason gave up 
and returned to his office to sit 
brooding at his desk. Farrington 
seemed determined to kill him, and 
he stSl couldn’t work up much en- 
thusiasm for a counterattack. At any 
rate he couldn’t think clearly about 
the problem with Farrington plot- 
ting actively next door. Kicking aside 
a pile of abstracts, he exited quietly 
through the hole in the wall. 

A fter a sleepless night in a rented 
hotel room (in case Farrington 
had his home address) he rose bleary 
eyed and despairingjy to face what 
would surely be another miserable 
day. He still had no plan, no hope. 
Perhaps there was some way of mere- 
ly disabling his rival .... But no, 
he couldn’t consider violence at all. 
Still, wasn’t one of Farrington’s arms 
or legs worth his own life? It was 
only a small concession to principle. 

He arrived at his office early and 
found that the new* tv camera had 
been installed and the laser hole 
sealed up. Of Farrington there was 
no sign. Gleason boiled some water 
in his percolator (after a thorough 
inspection), but soon discovered that 



his container of coffee had been 
shattered in one or more of the re« 
cent office catastrophes. There was 
nothing to do but go to the gradual^ 
lounge again. He slipped out quietly, 
pausing only to make sure Farring- 
ton’s door was closed, and ran tiptoe 
down the hallway, dodging arou^ a 
bit in case of pursuit by missiles. In 
the lounge he found no one but 
Throckmorton, snoring on one of the 
couches. 

“The spearmint,” said Throckmor- 
ton, opening one eye to peer dully at 
his boss. “Today’s the day!” 

In his anxiety over the murder 
attempts, Gleason had forgotten the 
experimental work scheduled with 
Throckmorton for that day. He felt 
a twinge of apprehen^on; the equip- 
ment they were using was dangerous, 
and in his present mood he coidd 
make any one of a number of errors. 
Still, if he tried to put off the experi- 
ment today his standing with Hunni- 
cutt might be damaged irreparably. 

“Go ahead and set it up,” he said. 
“I’ll be down later to work with you.” 

The shaggy boy unfolded himself 
from the couch, grinning vacuously. 
“I’ll get started on it right away, pro- 
fessor. Count on me.” He stumbled 
into Gleason, spilling the cup of cof- 
fee the man had just poured for him- 
self, and shambled off toward the 
stairway. The research lab was down- 
stair’s in the basement, almost directly 
beneath Gleason’s office. 

“And Throckmorton,” Gleason 
called after him, “don’t forget — it’s 
the red wire on the green coil.” 

“Green wire on red coil,” Throck- 
morton assured him and increased 
his pace, trying to appear enthusiastic.

I2P 




Gleason’s head buzzed with the 
effects of little sleep and much worry, 
so that he barely heard the boy. AIL 
his remaining emotional energy went 
into the task of drawing himself an- 
other cup of coffee. It . wasn’t until 
he was back at his desk diat the boy’s 
last words finally registered. 

He recalled at the same moment 
the possible result of attaching the 
green wire to the red coil. 

Suppressing a howl, he headed for 
the door, twisting frantically at the 
knob. 

The door refused to open. 

Gleason stood momentarily trans- 
fixed, the doorknob stiU in his hand. 
The door had never stuck like this 
before. He rattled the knob experi- 
mentally, bent over to peer through 
the keyhole. Something was blocking 
it from the other side, something 
that was not a key. At the same mo- 
ment he felt the doorknob grow 
warm beneath his hand. 

Gleason snatched his fingers away 
and stood up, backing away from the 
door. The knob was turning cherry 
red, and smoke had begun to issue 
from the door itself. Could Throck- 
morton already, .... Then he heard 
a bubble of wild laughter from next 
door, and he knew. 

“Got you this time!” Farrington 
screamed at him through their com- 
mon wall. “My heat converter will 
fry you alive within the next couple 
of minutes! The job is mine!” 

G leason wiped his damp brow 
with the back of his hand, 
searching about for some means of 
escape. Since the physics building 
was determinedly modem, it had no 



windows whatsoever; the door was 
the only way in or out. He glanced 
upward at the footsquare grill of the 
air-conditioning unit. Was he slim 
enou^ to worm his body through 
that passage? Desperately Gleason 
shoved ^ desk under the opening 
and clambered iip to test the grill. 
Six strong screws held it firmly across 
the outlet, and Gleason had no screw- 
driver. 

He peered down, spied the tele- 
phone on his desk. He might still be 
able to summon help. He had crouch- 
ed down and was just reaching for 
the receiver when the phone rang. 
Lifting the receiver he heard Throck- 
morton’s dull tones. “Everything’s all 
connected up„ professor. When ya 
cornin’ down?” 

“Throckmorton, get help! I’m 
locked in my office, and Farrington 
is trying to kill me!” 

“What’s that, professor?” the boy 
shouted. “I can hardly hear ya with 
all the noise from the equipment!” 

“I said Farrington — ” Gleason’s 
voice froze. “Did you say ‘noise 
from the equipment?’” 

“Yeah, professor, I got it goin’, 
all right.” 

“It’s operating — with the green 
wire on the red coil?” 

“Sure, right now it’s — ” 

But the sentence remained un- 
completed as the phone went dead 
and the right wall of Gleason’s office 
vanished. He dropped the receiver 
and stood staring at the vacant spot 
where Farrington’s office — and 
Farrington — had stood. About fifty 
square feet of floor space had been 
vaporized instantly. The laboratory, 
Gleason now recalled, was almost di- 



m 



IP 




rectly beneath his office. But just al- 
most directly. Actually it was be- 
neath Farrington’s. 

The door had stopped smoking, 
and Gleason threw it open easily, the 
now harmless attachment to Farring- 
ton’s heat converter clattering to the 
floor. He saw Hunnicutt scutde down 
the hall toward him, pipe bouncing 
nervously between his teeth. The 
chairman halted and stood awestruck 
before the hole in his building. At 
last he turned to Gleason, tears brim- 
ming in his eyes. “My boy, this is 
the most absolutely top-notch piece 
of work I’ve ever seen in this de- 
partment.” 

“But — ” 

“Oh, it’ll be rather expensive to 
replace this much of the building; 
but we’ve got government money, and 
I must say the loss is really worth it, 
under the circumstances. Never seen 
a cleaner, more humane liquidation 
since the tradition began.” 

A ragged figure appeared at the 
head of the basement stairs and 
lurched toward them. Apparently the 
force of the beam of destruction, or 
whatever the thing was, had been 
directed almost entirely upward. “It 
was really Throckmorton, here — ” 
Hunnicutt majestically placed an 
arm about the shoulders of the fright- 
ened boy. “This young man gave you 
a hand, did he? Pulled the trigger, so 
to spe^, while you were the bait. 
Brave lads, both of youl” 
Throckmorton, who had never in 
his entire life been addressed by any- 
one above the level of associate pro- 
fessor stood open-mouthed, basking 

REMEMBER: 



in the glow of sudden recognition. 
“You will no doubt benefit from this, 
too, Throckmorton,” the chairman 
went on. “Naturally there’ll be two 
assistant professorsMps vacant now, 
and I’m sure we can arrange a spot 
for you while you’re completing your 
doctoral requirements.” 

Perhaps, Gleason decided, there 
was no point in rocking the boat after 
all. With the coveted associate pro- 
fessorship his, and the beginnings of 
a new and infinitely murderous 
weapon created by attaching the 
green wire to the red cod, he was 
well on his way to a brilliant career 
in science. 

“Come into my office, both of 
you,” Hunnicutt was saying. “Got to 
get started on the paperwork for 
your appointments.” 

Watching his boss chew vigorously 
on his pipe, a foolproof idea for a 
booby trap slipped unbidden into 
Gleason’s mind. The whole thing was 
ridiculous, he told himself. He 
wouldn’t be in line for the depart- 
mental chairmanship for years! Still, 
it didn’t hurt .... “Do you have a 
pencil and paper, professor?” he 
asked. “I’d like to jot down a little 
idea I just had.” 

“Certainly, my boy,” Hunnicutt 
smiled, handing him the pencil and 
paper. “It’s the mark of a top-notch 
scientist that he’s always thinking, 
always searching for new ideas, al- 
ways looking toward the future.” 

“I’m afraid you’re right, sir,” Glea- 
son said; he was still scribbling furi- 
ously as he passed into the chair- 
man’s darkened office. END

all hands at landing stations, all 
passengers save one strapped in their 
acceleration couches (a sudden emer- 
gency requiring the use of the auxil- 
iary reaction drive was unlikely, but 



possible) the star ship Rim Dragon 
dropped slowly down to Port Grimes 
on Tharn. 

The privileged passenger — al- 
though in his case it was a right 
rather than a privilege — who was 
riding in the control room instead of 
being incarcerated in his cabin was 



133 






Commodore John Grimes, Astrofiau- 
tical Superintendent of Rim Runners. 
But he said nothing, did nothing that 
could be construed as inter fer^ce on 
Jlis part. Legally speaking, of course, 
he was no more than a guest in the 
Juaer^s nerve center. But, at the same 
time, he could and did exercise con- 
siderable authority over the space- 
going employees of Rim Runners, 
made the ultimate decisions in such 
matters as promotions and appoint- 
ments. However, Captain Wenderby, 
Rim Dragon's master, was a more 
than merely competent ship-handler. 
At no time did Grimes feel impelled 
to make any suggestions, at no time 
Hid his own hands start to reach out 
hungrily for the controls. 

So Grimes sat there, stolid and 
solid in his acceleration chair, not 
even now keeping a watchful eye on 
the briskly effidem Wenderby and 
his briskly efficient officers. They 
needed no advice from him, would 
heed none. But it was easier for them 
than it had been for him, vdxen he 
made his own first landing on Tharn 
— how many years ago? Too many. 
There had been no spaceport then, 
with Spaceport Control kecinng the 
master fully informed of meteorologi- 
cal conditions during his entire de- 
scent There had been no body of 
assorted officials — Port Captain, 
Customs, Port Health and all the 
rest of it — standing by awaiting the 
ship’s arrival. Grimes, in fact, had 
not known what or whom to expect, 
although his robot probes had told 
him that the culture of the planet 
was roughly analogous to that of 
Earth’s Middle Ages. Even so, he 
had been lucky in that he had set 



Faraway Quest down near a city con- 
trolled by the priesthood rather than 
in an area under the sway of one of 
the robber barons. • 

He looked out of one of the big 
viewports. From this altitude he could 
see no signs of change — but change 
there must have been, change there 
had been. On that long ago explora- 
tion voyage in the old Quest he had 
opened up the worlds of the Eastern 
Circuit to commerce — and the trad- 
er does more to destroy the old ways 
than either the gunboat or the mis- 
sionary. In this case the trader would 
have been the only outside influence. 
The Rim Worlds had always, fortu- 
nately for them, been governed by 
cynical, tolerant agnostics to whom 
gunboat diplomacy was distasteful. 
The Rim Worlders had always valued 
their own freedom too highly to wish 
to interfere with that of any other 
race. 

But even commerce^ thought 
Grimes, is an interference. It makes 
people want the things that they can- 
not yet produce far themselves — the 
mass-produced entertainment, the 
labor-saving machines^ the weapons. 
Grimes sighed. I suppose that we 
were right to arm the priesthood 
rather than the robber barons. In any 
case, the/ve been good customers. 

Captain Wenderby, still intent on 
his controls, spoke. “It must seem 
strange, coming back after all these 
years, sir.” 

“It does. Captain.” 

“And to see the spaceport that 
they named after you, for the first 
time.” 

“A man could have worse monu- 
ments.”

IF 




, Grimes transferred his attention 
from the viewport to the screen that 
showed, highly magnified, what was 
directly astern of and below the ship. 
Yes, there it was. Port Grimes. A 
great circle of gray-gleaming con- 
crete, ringed by warehouses and ad- 
ministration buildings, with cranes 
and gantries and conveyor belts cast- 
ing long shadows in the ruddy light 
of the westering sun. (He had made 
the first landing on rough heathland, 
and for a long, heart-stopping mo- 
ment had doubted that the tripedal 
landing gear would be able to ad- 
just to the irregularities of the sur- 
face.) And there was Rim Griffon, 
the reason for his voyage to Tham. 
There was the ship whose officers 
refused to sail with each other and 
with the master. There was the mess 
that had to be sorted out with as few 
firings as possible — Rim Runners, 
as usual, was short of spacefaring 
personnel. 

There was the mess. 

I t was some little time before John^ 
Grimes could get around to doing 
anything about it. As he should have 
foreseen, he was a personality, an 
historical personality at that. He was 
the first outsider to have visited 
Tham. He was responsible for the 
breaking of the power of the barons, 
for the rise to power of the priest- 
hood and the merchants. Too, the 
Rim Confederacy’s Ambassador on 
Tham had made it plain that he, 
and the government that he repre- 
sented, would appreciate it if the 
Commodore played along. The delay 
to the departure of a very unimport- 
ant merchant vessel was far less im- 

THE BIRD.BRAINED NAVIGATOR 



portant than the preservation of inter- 
stellar good relations. 

So Grimes was wined and dined, 
which was no hardship, and obliged 
to listen to long speeches, which was. 
He was taken on sightseeing tours, 
and was pleased to note that progress, 
although inevitable, had been a con- 
trolled progress, not progress for its 
own sake. The picturesque had been 
sacrificed only when essential for 
motives of hygiene or real efficiency. 
Electricity had supplanted the flar- 
ing natural gas jets for house and 
street lighting, but the importation 
and evolution of new building tech- 
niques and materials had not pro- 
duced a mushroom growth of steel 
and concrete matchboxes or plastic 
domes. Architecture still retained its 
essentially Thamian character, even 
though the streets of the city were 
no longer rutted, even though the 
traffic on those same streets was now 
battery-powered cars and no longer 
animal-drawn vehicles. (Internal com- 
bustion engines were manufactured 
on the planet, but their use was pro- 
hibited within urban limits.) 

And at sea, change had come. At 
the time of Grimes’s first landing the 
only ocean-going vessels had been 
the big schooners. Now sail was on 
its way out, ousted by the steam tur- 
bine. Yet the ships, with their fiddle 
bows and their figureheads, with their 
raked masts and funnels, still dis- 
played an archaic charm that was 
altogether lacking on Earth’s seas 
and on the waters of most Man-col- 
onized worlds. The commodore, who 
was something of an authority on the 
history of marine transport, would 
dearly have loved to have made a 

135 




voyage in one of the steamers, but 
he knew that time would not permit 
this. Once he had sorted out Rim 
Griffon's troubles, he would have to 
return to Port Forlorn, probably in 
that very ship. 

At last he was able to get around 
to the real reason for his visit to 
Tharn. On the morning of his fifth 
day on the planet he strode purpos- 
ively across the clean, well-cared-for 
concrete of the apron, walked de- 
cisively up the ramp to Rim Griffon*s 
after airlock door. There was a junior 
officer waiting there to receive him; 
Captain Dingwall had been warned 
that he would be coming on board. 
Grimes knew the young man, as he 
should have done. After all, he had 
interviewed him when he had applied 
for a berth in the Rim Runners’ 
service. 

“Good morning, Mr. Taylor.” 

“Good morning, sir.” The third 
officer was painfully nervous, and 
his prominent Adam’s apple hobbled 
as he spoke. His ears, almost as 
outstanding as Grime’s own, flushed 
a dull red. “The Old ...” The 
flush spread to all of Taylor’s fea- 
tures. “The master is waiting for 
you, sir. This way, sir.” 

Grimes did not need a guide. This 
Rim Griffon, like most of the older 
units in Rim Runners’ fleet, had 
started her career as an Epsilon Class 
tramp in the employ of the Inter- 
stellar Transport Commission. The 
general layout of those tried and 
trusted galactic workhorses was famil- 
iar to all spacemen. However, young 
Mr. Tayor had been instructed by his 
captain to receive the commodore 
and to escort him to his, Dingwall’s, 
<1 



quarters, and Grimes had no desire 
to interfere with the running of the 
ship. 

Yet. 

The two men rode up in the ele- 
vator in silence, each immersed in his 
own thoughts. Taylor, obviously, was 
apprehensive. A delay to a vessel is 
always a serious matter, especially 
when her own officers are involved. 
And Grimes was sorting out his own 
impressions to date. This Rim Grif- 
fon was obviously not a happy ship. 
He could feel it — just as he could 
see and hear the faint yet unmis- 
takable signs of neglect, die hints of 
rust and dust, the not yet anguished 
pleading of a machine somewhere, 
a fan or a pump, for lubrication. And 
as the elevator cage passed through 
the “farm” level there was a whiff 
of decaying vegetation; either algae 
vats or hydroponic tanks — or both 
— were overdue for cleaning out. 

The elevator stopped at the Cap- 
tain’s Deck. Young Mr. Tayor led 
the way out of the cage, knocked 
diffidently at the door facing that 
into the axial shaft. It did open. A 
deep voice said, “That will be all, 
Mr. Taylor. I’ll send for you and the 
other officers when I want you. And 
come in, please, Commodore 
Grimes.” 

G rimes entered the day cabin. 

Dingwall rose to meet him — a 
short, stocky man, his features too 
large, too ruddy, to eyes too brilli- 
antly blue under a cockatoo-crest of 
white hair. He extended a hand, say- 
ing, “Welcome aboard. Commodore.” 
He did not manage to make the 
greeting sound convincing. “Sit down. 



136 



IP 




sir. The sun^s not yet over the yard- 
arm, but I can offer you coffee.” 

“No thank you, Captain. Later, 
perhaps. Mind if I smoke?” Grimes 
produced his battered pipe, filled and 
lit it. He said through the initial acrid 
cloud, “And now, sir, what is the 
trouble? Your ship h^s been held up 
for far too long.” 

“You should have asked me that 
five days ago, Commodore.” 

“Should I?” Grimes stared at Ding- 
wall, his gray eyes bleak. “Perhaps 
I should. Unfortunately I was obliged 
to act almost in an ambassadorial ca- 
pacity after I arrived here. But now 
I am free to attend to the real busi- 
ness.” 

“It’s my officers,” blurted Ding- 
wall. 

“Yes?” 

“The second mate to begin with. 
A bird-brained navigator if ever there 
was one. Can you imagine anybody, 
with all the aids we have today, get- 
ting lost between Stree and Mellise? 
He did.” 

“Legally speaking,” said Grimes, 
“the master is responsible for every- 
thing. Including the navigation of his 
ship.” 

“I navigate myself. Now.” 

And I can imagine it, thought 
Grimes. “Do I have to do every- 
body*s bloody job in this bloody ship? 
Of course, Fm only the captain . 
He said, “You reprimanded him, of 
course?” 

“Too right I did.” Dingwall’s 
voice registered pleasant remini- 
scence. “I told him that he was in- 
capable of navigating a plastic duck 
across a bathtub.” 

“Hmm. And your other officers?” 



“There’re the engineers. Commo- 
dore. The interstellar drive chief hates 
the inertial drive chief. Not that I’ve 
much time for either of ’em. In fact 
I told Willis — he’s supposed to run 
the inertial drive — that he couldn’t 
pull a soldier off his sister. That was 
after I almost had to use the auxiliary 
rockets to get clear of Grollor . .” 
“And the others?” 

“Vacchini, my mate. He couldn’t 
run a pie cart. And Sally Bowen, the 
catering officer, can’t boil water 
without burning it. And Pilchin, the 
so-called purser, can’t add two and 
two and get the same answer twice 
running. And as for Sparks ... I’d 
stand a better chance of getting an 
important message through if I just 
opened a control viewport and stood 
there and shouted.” 

The officer who is to blame for 
all this, thought Grimes, is the doctor. 
He should have seen this coming on. 
But perhaps Vm to blame as well, 
DingwalVs home port is Port Forlorn, 
on Lorn — and his ship^s been run- 
ning between the worldfs of the East- 
ern Circuit and Port Farewell, on 
Faraway, for the past nine standard 
months. And Mrs, Dingwall (Grimes 
had met her) is too fond of her social 
life to travel with him .... 

“Don’t you like the ship. Captain?” 
he asked. 

“The ship's all right,” he was told 
sarcastically. 

“But the run, as far as you’re con- 
cerned, could be better?” 

“And the officers.” 

“Couldn’t we all. Captain Ding- 
wall? Couldn’t we all? And now, just 
between ourselves, who is it that re- 
fuses to sail with you?” 



THE BIRD-BRAINED NAVIGATOR 



137 




“My bird-brained navigator. I 
hurt his feelings when I called him 
that. A very sensitive young man is 
our Mr. Missenden. And the inertial 
drive chief. He’s a member of some 
fancy religion called the Neo-Cal- 
vinists.” 

“I’ve met them,” said Grimes. 

“What 1 said about his sister and 
the soldier really shocked him.” 

“And which of them refuse to sail 
with the other?” 

“Almost everybody has it in for 
the second mate. He’s a Latter Day 
Fascist and is always trying to make 
converts. And the two chiefs are at 
each other’s throat Kerholm, the 
interstellar drive specialist, is a mili- 
tant atheist . ” 

And I was on my annual leave, 
thought Grimes, when this prize 
bunch of square pegs was appointed 
to this round hole. Even so, I should 
have checked up. 

“Captain,” he said, “I appreciate 
your problems. But there are two 
sides to every story. Mr. Vacchini, 
for example, is a very efficient of- 
ficer. As far as he is concerned, there 
could well be a clash of personali- 
ties.” 

“Perhaps,” admitted Dingwall 
grudgingly. 

“As for the others, I don’t know 
them personally. If you could tell 
them all to meet .in the wardroom in 
— say — five minutes, we can go 
down to try to iron some of these 
things out.” 

“Fom can try,” said the captain. 
“I’ve had them all in a big way. And, 
to save you the bother of saying it. 
Commodore Grimes, they’ve had me 
likewise.” 



II 

G rimes ironed things out. On his 
way from Lorn to Tharn he had 
studied the files of reports on the 
captain and his officers. In other cir- 
cumstances he would have been quite 
ruthless — but good spacemen do not 
grow on trees, especially out towards 
the Galactic Rim. And these were 
good spacemen, all of them — with 
the exception of Missenden, the sec- 
ond officer. He had been born on 
New Saxony, one of the worlds that 
had been part of the short-lived 
Duchy of Waldegren, and one of the 
worlds upon which the political per- 
versions practiced upon Waldegren 
itself had lived on for years after the 
downfall of the Duchy. He had been 
an officer in the navy of New Saxony 
and had taken part in the action off 
Pelisande, the battle in which the 
heavy cruisers of the Survey Service 
had destroyed the last of the self- 
styled commerce raiders who were, 
in fact, no better than pirates. ^ 
There had been survivors, and 
Missenden had been one of them. 
(He owed his survival mainly to the 
circumstance that the ship of which 
he had been navigator had been late 
in arriving at her rendezvous with the 
other New Saxony war vessels and 
had, in fact, surrendered after no 
more than a token resistance.) He 
had stood trial with other war crimin- 
als, but had escaped with a very light 
sentence. (Most of the witnesses who 
could have testified against him were 
dead.) As he had held a lieutenant 
commander’s commission in the nayy 
of New Saxony he had been able to 
obtain a Master Astronaut’s Certifi- 



138 



IF 




cate after no more than the merest 
apology for an examination. Then 
he had drifted out to the Rim, where 
his New Saxony qualifications were 
valid — where, in fact, qualifications 
issued by any human authority any- 
where in the galaxy were valid. 

Grimes looked at Missenden. He 
did not like what he saw. He had not 
liked it when He first met the man, 
a few years ago, when he had en- 
gaged him as a probationary third 
officer — but then, as now, he had 
not been able to afford to turn space- 
men away from his office door. The 
second officer was tall, with a jutting, 
arrogant beak of a nose over a wide, 
thin-lipped mouth, with blue eyes 
that looked even madder than Cap- 
tain Dingwall’s, his pale, freckled 
face topped by close-cropped red 
hair. He was a fanatic, that was ob- 
vious from his physical appearance. 
And in a ship -where he, like every- 
body else, was unhappy, his fanaticism 
would be enhanced. A lean and hun- 
gry look, thought Grimes. He thinks 
too much; such men are dangerous. 
He added mentally, But only when 
they think about the wrong things. 
The late Duke Otto*s Galactic Super- 
man, for example, rather than PiU 
gren*s Principles of Interstellar Navi- 
gation, 

He said, ‘‘Mr. Missenden.” 

“Sir?” The curtly snapped word 
was almost an insult. The way in 
which it was said implied, “Fm ac- 
cording respect to your rank, not 
to youJ* 

“The other officers have agreed to 
Continue the voyage. On arrival at 
Port Forlorn you will all be trans- 
ferred to more suitable ships, and 



those of you who are due will be 
sent on leave or time off as soon as 
possible. Are you agreeable?” 

“No.” 

“And why not, Mr. Missenden?” 
“I’m not prepared to make an 
intercontinental hop under a captain 
who insulted me.” 

“Insulted you?” 

“Yes.” He turned on Dingwall. 
“Did you, or did you not, call me 
a bird-brained navigator?” 

“I did, Mr. Missenden,” snarled 
Captain Dingwall. “And I meant it.” 
“Captain,” asked Grimes patiently, 
“are you prepared to withdraw that 
remark?” 

“I am not. Commodore. Further- 
more, as master of this ship I have 
the legal right to discharge any mem- 
ber of my crew anywhere that I see 
fit.” 

“Very well,” said Grimes. “As 
Captain Dingwall has pdnted out I 
can only advise and mediate. But I 
do possess some authority; appoint- 
ments and transfers are my responsi- 
bility. Will you arrange, Captain, for 
Mr. Missenden to be paid, on your 
books, up to and including midnight, 
local time? Then get him off your 
Articles of Agreement as soon as 
possible, so that the second officer 
of Rim Dragon can be signed on here. 
And you, Mr. Missenden, will join 
Rim Dragon,” 

“If you say so,” said Missenden. 
“Sir.” 

“I do say so. And I say, too, Mr. 
Missenden, that I shall see you again 
in my office back in Port Forlorn.” 
“I can hardly wait Sir.” 

Captain Dingwall looked at his 
watch. He said, “The purser already 



THE BIRO-BRAINED NAVIGATOR 



139 




has Mr. Missenden’s payoff almost 
finalized. Have you made any ar^ 
rangements with Captain Wenderby 
regarding his second officer?” 

told him that there might be a 
transfer, Captain. Shall we meet at 
the consul’s office at 1500 hours? 
You probably already know that he 
is empowered to act as shipping 
master insofar as our ships on Tharn 
are concerned.” 

“Yes, sir,” stated Dingwall. “I 
know.” 

“You would,” muttered Missen- 
den. 

The transfer of officers was nice 
and easy in theory — but it did not 
work out in practice. The purser. 
Grimes afterwards learned, was the 
only person aboard Rim Griffon with 
whom the second officer was not on 
terms of acute enmity. Missenden 
persuaded him to arrange his pay- 
off for 1400 hours, not 1500. At the 
appointed time the purser of the 
Griffon was waiting in the consul’s 
office, and shortly afterwards the 
purser and the second officer of Rim 
Dragon put in their appearance. The 
Dragon's second mate was paid off 
his old ship and signed on the articles 
of his new one. But Missenden had 
vanished. All that Griffon's purser 
knew was that he had taken the 
money due him and said that he had 
to make a business call and that hQ 
would be back. 

He did not come back. 

C ommodore Grimes was not in a 
happy mood. He had hoped to 
be a passenger aboard Rim Griffon 
when she lifted off from Port Grimes, 
but now it seemed that his departure 



from Tharn for the Rim Worlds 
would have to be indefinitely post- 
poned. 

It was, of course, all Missenden’s 
fault. Now that he had gone into 
smoke, all sorts of unsavory facts 
were coming to light regarding that 
officer. During his ship’s visits to 
Tharn he had made contact with 
various subversive elements. The 
consul had not known of this — but 
Rim Runners’ local agent, a native 
to the planet, had. It was the police 
who had told him, and he had passed 
the information on to Captain Ding- 
wall. Dingwall had shrugged and 
growled, “What the hell else do you 
expect from such a drongo?” adding, 
“As long as I get shut of the bastard 
he can consort with Aldebaranian 
necrophiles for airi carel” 

Quite suddenly, with Grimes’s 
baggage already loaded aboard Rim 
Griffon, the mess had blown up to 
the proportions of an interstellar in- 
cident. The Port Grimes Customs re- 
fused outward clearance to the ship. 
The Rim Confederacy’s ambassador 
sent an urgent message to Grimes 
requiring him to disembark at once 
— after which the ship would be 
permitted to leave — and to report 
forthwith to the Embassy. With all 
this happening, Grimes was in no 
fit state to listen to Captain Wender- 
by’s complaints that he had lost a 
first class second officer and now 
would have to sail short-handed on 
completion of discharge. 

The ambassador’s own car took 
Grimes from the spaceport to the 
Embassy. It was a large building, 
ornately turreted, with metal-bound 
doors that could have withstood the 



140 



IF 




charge of a medium tank. These 
opened as the commodore dismount- 
ed from the vehicle, and within them 
stood saluting Marines. At least, 
thought Grimes, they aren't going to 
shoot me. Yet. An aide in civilian 
clothes escorted him to the ambassa- 
dor’s office. 

The Honorable Clifford Webb was 
a short, fat man with all of a short, 
fat man’s pomposity. “Sit down, 
Commodore,” he huffed. Then, 
glowering over his wide, highly pol- 
ished desk at the spaceman, “Now, 
sir. This Missenden character. What 
about him? Hey?” 

“He seems to have flown the 
coop,” said Grimes. 

“You amaze me, sir.” Webb’s 
glower became even more pronounc- 
ed. “You amaze me, sir. Not by what 
you said, but by the way in which 
70U said it. Surely you, even you have 
some appreciation of the seriousness 
of the situation?” 

“Spacemen have deserted before, 
in foreign ports. Just as seamen used 
to do. Still do. The local police have 
his description. They’ll pick him up 
and deport him when they get him. 
And we’ll deport him, too, when he’s 
delivered back to the Confederacy.” 
“And you still don’t think it’s 
serious? Hey?” 

“Frankly, no, sir.” 

“Commodore, you made the first 
landing on this planet. But what do 
you know about it? Nothing, sir. 
Nothing. You haven’t lived here, I 
have. I know that the Confederacy 
win have to fight to maintain the 
currently favorable trade relations 
that we still enjoy with Tham. Al- 
ready other astronautical powers are 



sniffing around the worlds of the 
Eastern Circuit . ” 

“During the last six months, local 
time,” said Grimes, “three of the 
Empire of Waverley’s ships have 
called here. And two from the 
Shakespearean Sector* And one of 
Trans-Galactic Qippeis’ cargo liners. 
But, as far as the rulers of Tham are 
concerned, the Confederacy is still the 
most favored nation.” 

“Who are the riders of Tharn?” 
barked the ambassador, 

“Why, the priesthood.” 

The ambassador mumbled some- 
thing about the political illiteracy of 
spacemen, then got to his feet He 
waddled to the far wall of his office, 
on which was hung a huge map of 
the planet in Mercatorial projeciion, 
beckoned to Grimes to follow him. 
From a rack he took a long pointer. 
“The island continent of Ansiphal 
. .” he said. “And here, on the 
eastern seaboard, Port Grimes, and 
the University City. Where we are 
now.” 

‘Tfes.” 

The tip of the pointer described 
a rhumb line, almost due east. “The 
other island continent of the northern 
hemisphere, almost the twin to this 
one. Climatically, politically — you 
name it.” 

“Yes?” 

The pointer backtracked, then 
stabbed viciously. “And here, well to 
the west of Braziperu, the island of 
Tangaroa. Not a continent — but still 
a sizeable hunk of real estate.” 

“So?” 

“So Tangaroa’s the last stronghold 
of the robber barons, the ruffians who 
were struggling for power with the

priests and merchants when you 
made your famous first landing. How 
many years ago was it? Hey?” 

“But what’s that to do with Mr. 
Missenden,” Grimes asked. “And 
me?” he added. 

“Your Mr. Missenden,” the am- 
bassador said, “served in the navy 
of New Saxony. The people with 
whom he’s been mixing in the Uni- 
versity City are Tangaroan agents and 
sympathizers. The priesthood has al- 
low^ Tangaroa to continue to exist 
— in fact, there’s even trade between 
it and Ausiphal — but has been re- 
luctant to allow the Tangaroans ac- 
cess to any new knowledge, especial- 
ly knowledge that could be perverted 
to the manufacture of weaponry. 
Your Mr. Missenden would be a veri- 
table treasure house of such knowl- 
edge.” 

“He’s not my Mr. Missenden!” 
snapped Grimes. 

“But he is, sir. He is. You engaged 
him when he came out to the Rim. 
You appointed him to ships running 
the Eastern Circuit. You engineered 
his discharge on this world, even.” 

“So what am I supposed to do 
about him?” 

“Find him, before he does any 
real damage. And if you, the man 
after whom the spaceport was named, 
are successful it will show the High 
Priest just how much we, of the Con- 
federacy, have the welfare of Tharn 
at heart.” 

“But why me? These people have 
a very efficient police force. And a 
man with a pale, freckled face and 
red hair wil! stand oift like a sore 
thumb among the natives.” 

The Honorable Mr. Webb laughed 



scornfully. “Green skin dye! Dark 
blue hair dye! Contact lenses! And, 
on top of all that, a physical appear- 
ance that’s common on this planet!” 
“Yes,” admitted Grimes. “I might 
recognize him, in spite of a dis- 
guise . .” 

“Good. My car is waiting to take 
you to the High Priest.” 

T he university stood on a rise to 
the east of the city, overlooking 
the broad river and, a few miles to 
the north, the sea. It looked more 
like a fortress than a seat of learn- 
ing — and in Tham’s turbulent past 
it had more than once been castle 
rather than academy. 

Grimes respected the Tharnian 
priesthood. The religion that they 
preached and practiced made more 
sense to him than most of the other 
faiths of Man. There was something 
of Buddhism about it, a recognition 
of the fact that nothing is, but that 
everything is flux, change, a contin- 
ual process of becoming. There was 
the equation of God with Knowledge 
— but never that infuriating state- 
ment made by so many Terran re- 
ligions, that smug “There are things 
that we aren’t meant to know.” There 
was a very real wisdom — the wis- 
dom that accepts and rejects, and 
that does neither just because a con- 
cept is new. There was a reluctance 
to rush headlong into an industrial 
revolution, with all its miseries. And, 
at the same time, no delay in the 
adoption of techniques that would 
make the life of the people longer, 
easier and happier. 

Night had fallen when the em- 
bassy car pulled up outside the great

gates of the university. The guard 
turned out smartly — but in these 
days their function was merely cere- 
monial; no longer was there the need 
either to keep the students in or the 
townsfolk out. On all of Tharn — 
save for Tangaroa — the robber 
barons were only an evil memory of 
the past. 

A black-uniformed officer led 
Grimes through long corridors, lit by 
bright electric bulbs, and up stair- 
ways to the office of the High Priest. 
He, an elderly, black-robed man, 
frail, his skin darkened by age to an 
opaque olive, had been a young stu- 
dent at the time of the first lamiing. 
He had claimed to have met the com- 
modore on that occasion, but Grimes 
could not remember him. But he was 
almost the double of the old man 
who had held the high office then 
— a clear example of the job making 
the man. 

“Commodore Grimes,” he said. 
“Please be seated.” 

“Thank you. Your Wisdom.” 

“I am sorry to have interfered 
with your plans, sir. But your Mr. 
Webb insisted.” 

“He assured me that it was im- 
portant.” 

“And he has . put you in the 
picture?” 

“Yes.” 

The old man produced a decanter, 
two graceful glasses. He poured the 
wine. Grimes relaxed. He remember- 
ed that the Tharnian priesthood 
made a point of never drinking with 
anybody whom they considered an 
enemy, with nobody who was not a 
friend in the true sense of the word. 
There was no toast, only a ceremonial 



raising of goblets. The liquor was 
good, as it always had been. 

“^JVTiat can I do?” asked Grimes. 
The priest shrugged. “Very little. 
I told Mr. Webb that our own police 
were quite capable of handling the 
situation, but he said, Tt’s his mess. 
He shoidd have his nose rubbed in 
it.* *’ The old man’s teeth were very 
white in his dark face as he smiled. 

“Tales out of school, Your Wis- 
dom,” grinned Grimes. “Now I’ll 
tell one. Mr. Webb doesn’t like space- 
men. A few years ago his wife made 
a cruise in one of the T-G Clippers. 
And when the divorce came through, 
she married the chief officer of the 
liner she traveled in.” 

The High Priest laughed. “That 
accounts for it. But I shall enjoy your 
company for a few weeks that you 
will have to stay on Tharn, I shall 
tell my people to bring your baggage 
from the embassy over here to the 
University.” 

“That is very good of you.” 
Grimes took another sip of the 
strong wine. “But I think that since 
I’m here I shall help in the search for 
Mr. Missenden. After all, he is still, 
officially, one of our nationals.” 

“As you please. Commodore. Tell 
me, if you were in charge how would 
you set about it?” 

Grimes lapsed into silence. He 
looked around the office. All of the 
walls were covered with books, save 
one, and on it hung another of those 
big maps. He said, “He’ll have to get 
out by sea, of course.” 

“Of course. We have no commer- 
cial airship service to Tangaroa. And 
the Tangaroans have no commercial 
airship service at all.”

“And you have no submarines yet, 
and youritterial coastguard patrol will 
keep you informed as to the move- 
ments of all surface vessels. So he 
will have to make his getaway in a 
merchant vessel .... Would you 
know if there are any Tangaroan 
merchantmen in port?” 

“I would know. There is one — 
the Kawaroa. She is loading textiles 
and all kinds of agricultural machin- 
ery.” 

“Could she be held for any reason- 
able length of time?” 

“On what excuse, Commodore? 
The Tangaroans are very touchy peo- 
ple, and if the ship is detained dieir 
consul will at once send off a radio 
message to his government.” 

“A very touchy people, you say. 
And arrogant. And quarrelsome. 
Now, just suppose that there’s a 
good, old-fashioned tavern brawl, as 
a result of which the master and his 
officers are all arrested . • . ” 

“It’s the sort of thing that could 
easily happen. It has happened, more 
than once.” 

“Just prior to sailing, shall we 
say? And then, with the ship im- 
mobilized, with only rather dim- 
witted ratings to try to hinder us, 
we make a thorough search — ac- 
commodation, holds, machinery 
spaces, storerooms, the works.” 

“The suggestion certainly has its 
merits.” 

“The only snag,” admitted Grimes, 
“is that it’s very unlikely that the 
master and all three of his mates will 
rush ashore for a quick one just be- 
fore sailing.” 

“But in this case they always do,” 
said the High Priest. 



A s they always had done, they did. 

Grimes watched proceedings 
from the innkeeper’s cubbyhole, a 
little compartment just above the 
mam barroom with cunning peep- 
hole in its floor. He would have pre- 
ferred to have been among the crowd 
of seamen, fishermen and water- 
siders, but his rugged face was too 
well known on Tharn, and no amount 
of hair and skin dye could have dis- 
guised him. He watched the four bur- 
ly, blue-and-brass clad men breasting 
the bar, drinking by themselves, toss- 
ing dovm pot after pot of the strong 
ale. He saw the fat girl whose dyed 
yellow hair was in vivid contrast to 
her green skin nuzzle up to the man 
who was obviously the Tangaroan 
captain. He wanted none of her. 
Grimes sympathized with him. Even 
from his elevated vantage point he 
could see that her exposed, over- 
blown breasts were sagging uglily, 
that what little there was of her dress 
was stained and bedraggled. But the 
man need not have brushed her away 
so brutally. She squawked like an 
indignant parrot as she fell sprawling 
to the floor with a display of fat, un- 
lovely legs. 

One of the other drinkers — a 
fisherman by the looks of him — 
came to the aid of beauty in distress. 
Or perhaps it was only that he was 
annoyed because the woman, in her 
fall, had jostled him, spilling his 
drink. Or, even more likely, both he 
and the woman were the High Priest’s 
agents. If such were the case, he 
seemed to be enjoying his work. His 
huge left hand grasped the captain’s 



144 



IF 




shoulder, turning him and holding 
him, and then right fist and left knee 
worked in unison. It was dirty but 
effective. 

After that — as Grimes said later, 
telling about it — it was on for young 
and old. The three mates, swinging 
their heavy metal drinking pots, ral- 
lied to the defense of their master. 
The fisherman picked up a heavy 
stool to use as his weapon. The wom- 
an, who had scrambled to her feet 
with amazing agility for one of her 
bulk, sailed into the fray, fell to a 
crouching posture and straightened 
abruptly, and one of the Tangaroan 
officers went sailing over her head as 
though rocket-propelled, crashing 
down on to a table at which three 
watersiders had been enjoying a 
quiet, peaceful drink. They, roaring 
their displeasure, fell upon the hap- 
less foreigner with fists and feet. 

The police officer with Grimes — 
his English was not too good — said, 
“Pity break lip good fight. But must 
arrest very soon.” 

“You’d better,” the commodore 
told him. “Some of those gentry 
down there are p ullin g knives.” 

Yes, knives were out, gleaming 
wickedly in the lamplight. Knives 
were out, but the Tangaroans — with 
the exception of the victim of the 
lady and her stevedoring friends — 
had managed to retreat to a corner 
and there were fighting off all com- 
ers, although the captain, propped 
against the wall, was playing no 
great part in the proceedings. Like 
the fisherman, the two officers had 
picked up stools, were using them 
both as shields and weapons, deflect- 
ing with them flung pots and bottles. 



smashing them doy/n on the heads 
and arms of their assailants. 

The captain was recovering slowly. 
His hand went up to fumble inside 
the front of his coat. It came out, 
holding something that gleamed 
evilly — a pistol. But he fired it 
only once, and harmlessly. The weap- 
on went off as his finger tightened 
on the trigger quite involuntarily, as 
the knife thrown by the yellow-haired 
slattern pinned his wrist to the wall. 

And then the place was full of 
University police, tough men in black 
tunics who used their clubs quite 
indiscrimiliately and herded all those 
present out into the waiting trucks. 

Quietly, Grimes and the police of- 
ficer left their observation post and 
went down the back stairs. Outside 
the inn they were joined by twelve 
men — six police and six ^customs. 
These latter were used to searching 
ships. Their heels ringing on the 
damp cobblestones, they made their 
way through the misty night to the 
riverside, to the quays. 

K awaroa was ready for sea, await- 
ing only the pilot and, of course, 
her master and officers. Her derricks 
were stowed, her moorings had been 
singled up, and a feather of smoke 
from her tall, raked funnel showed 
that steam had been raised. She was 
not a big ship, but she looked smart, 
well maintained, seaworthy. 

As Grimes and his party approach- 
ed the vessel they saw that somebody 
had gotten there ahead of them, a 
dark figure who clattered hastily up 
the gangway. But there was no cause 
for hurry. The ship, with all her 
navigating officers either in jail or in 



THE BIRD-BRAINED NAVIGATOR 



145 




hospital, would not be sailing, and 
the harbor master had already been 
told not to send a pilot down to take 
her out. 

There was no cause for hurry .... 

But what was that jangling of bells, 
loud and disturbing in the still night? 
The engineroom telegraph? The 
routine testing of gear one hour be- 
fore the time set for departure? 

And what were those men doing, 
scurrying along to fo’c’s’le head and 
poop? 

Grimes broke into a run, and as he 
did so heard somebody * shouting 
from Kawarocfs bridge. The language 
was unfamiliar, but the voice was 
not. It was Missenden’s. From for- 
ward there was a thunk! and then a 
splash as the end of the severed 
headline fell into the still water. The 
last of the flood caught the ship’s 
bows and she fell away from the 
wharf. With the police and customs 
officers, who had belatedly realized 
what was happening, well behind him. 
Grimes reached the edge of the quay. 
It was all of five feet to the end of 
the still-dangling gangway and the 
gap was rapidly widening. \Wthout 
thinking. Grimes jumped. Had he 
known that nobody would follow him 
he would never have done so. But 
he jumped, and his desperate fingers 
closed around the outboard manropes 
of the accommodation ladder and 
somehow, paying a heavy toll of 
abrasions and lacerations he was able 
to squirm upwards uptil he was 
kneeling on the bottom platform. 
Dimly he was aware of shouts from 
the fast receding quayside. Again he 
heard the engineroom telegraph bells 
and felt the vibration as the screw 



began to turn. So the after lines had 
been cut, too, and the ship was un- 
der way. And it was — he remem- 
bered the charts that he had looked 
at — a straight run down river with 
absolutely no need for local knowl- 
edge. From above sounded a single, 
derisory blast from Kawawa's steam 
whistle. 

Grimes was tempted to drop from 
his perch, to swim back ashore. But 
he knew too much. He had always 
been a student of maritime history 
in all its aspects. He knew that a 
man going overboard from a ship 
making way through the water stands 
a very good chance of being pulled 
under and then cut to pieces by the 
screw. In any case, he had said that 
he would find Missenden, and he 
had done just that. 

Slowly, painfuly he pulled himself 
erect, then walked slowly up the 
clattering treads to deck level. 

T here was nobody on deck to re- 
ceive him. This was not surpris- 
ing; Missenden and the crew must 
have been too engrossed in getting 
away from the wharf to notice his 
literal pierhead jump. So .... He 
was standing in an alleyway, open 
on the pdrt side. Looking out, he 
saw the seaport lights sliding past, 
and ahead and on to port there was 
the white-flashing fairway buoy al- 
ready — dim, but from mist rather 
than distance. Inboard there was a 
varnished wooden door set in the 
white-painted plating of the ’mid- 
ships house, obviously the entrance 
to the accommodation. 

Grimes opened it without difficul- 
ty — door-handles will be invented 



146 



IF 




and used by any being approximating 
to human structure. Inside there was 
a cross alleyway, brightly illuminated 
by electric hght bulbs in well fittings. 
On the after bulkhead of this there 
was a steel door, and the mechanical 
hum and whine that came behind it 
told Grimes that it led to the engine- 
room. On the forward bulkhead there 
was another wooden door. 

Grimes went through it. Another 
alleyway, cabins, and a companion- 
way lea^ng upwards. At the top of 
this there were more cabins, and an- 
other companionway. And at the top 
of this ... the master’s accommoda- 
tion, obviously, even though the word 
on the tally over the door was no 
more than a meaningless squiggle to 
Grimes. 

One more companionway — this 
one with a functional handrail in- 
stead of a relatively ornate balustrade. 
At the head of it was a curtained 
doorway. Grimes pushed through the 
heavy ^ape, found himself in what 
could be the chartroom, looked brief- 
ly at the wide chart table upon which 
was a plan of the harbor, together 
with a pair of dividers and a set of 
parallel rulers. The Confederacy, he 
remembered, had at one time ex- 
ported quite large consignments of 
these instruments to Tham. 

^ On the forward bulkhead of the 
chartroom, and to port, was the door- 
way leading out to the wheelhouse 
and bridge. Softly, Grimes stepped 
through it, out into near darlmess. 
The only light was that showing 
from the compass periscope, the de- 
vice that enabled the helmsman to 
steer by the standard magnetic com- 
pass, the binnacle of which was sited 



up yet one more deck, on what 
had been called on Earth’s surface 
ships the “monkey island.” There 
was the man at the wheel, intent up- 
on his job. And there, at the fore 
end of the wheelhouse, were two 
dark figures, looking out through the 
wide windows. One of them, the tall- 
er one, turned suddenly, said some- 
thing in Tangaroan. As before, the 
voice was familiar but the language 
was not. 

The question — intonation made 
that plain — was repeated, and then 
Missenden said in English, “It’s you! 
How the hell did you get aboard? 
Hold it. Commodore, hold it!” There 
was just enough light for Grimes to 
see the pistol that was pointing at his 
midriff. 

“Turn this ship round,” ordered 
Grimes, “and take her back into 
port.” 

“Not bloody likely.” Missenden 
laughed. “Especially when I’ve gone 
to all trouble of taking her out of 
port. Pity old Dingwall wasn’t here 
to see it. Not bad, was it, for a bird- 
brained navigator? And keep your 
hands up, where I can see them.”^ 

“I’m unarmed,” said Grimes. 

“I’ve only your word for it,” Miss- 
enden told him. Then he said some- 
thing to his companion, who replied 
in what, in happier circumstances, 
would have been a very pleasant con- 
tralto. The girl produced a mouth 
whistle, blew a piercing blast. In 
seconds two burly seamen had ap- 
peared on the bridge. They grabbed 
Grimes and held him tightly while 
she ran practiced hands over his 
clothing. It was not the first time 
that she had searched a man for 



THE BIRD-BRAINED NAVIGATOR

^e^ons. Then they dragged him be- 
low, unlocked a steel door and threw 
him into the tiny compartment be- 
yond it. The heavily barred port 
n^de it obvious that it was the ship’s 
brig.

T hey locked him in and left him 
there. 

Grimes examined his surroundings 
by the light of the single, dim bulb. 
Deck, deckhead and bulkheads were 
all of steel. But had they been of 
plyboard it would have made no 
difference; that blasted girl had taken 
from him the only possession that 
could possibly have been used as a 
weapon, his pocketknife. There was 
a steel-framed bunk, with a thin 
mattress and one sleazy blanket. 
There was a stained washbasin, and 
a single faucet which, when persuad- 
ed, emitted a trickle of rusty water. 
There was a bucket — plastic, not 
metal. Still, it could have been worse. 
He could sleep — perhaps — and 
he would not die of thirst. Fully 
clothed, he lay down on the bunk. 
He realized that he was physically 
tired; his desperate leap for the 
gangway had taken something out of 
him. And the ship was moving gent- 
ly now, a slight, soporific roll, and 
the steady hum and vibration of the 
turbines helped further to induce 
slumber. There was nothing he could 
do, absolutely nothing, and to lose 
valuable sleep by useless worry would 
have been foolish. 

He slept. 

It was the girl who awakened him. 
She stood there, bending over him. 



shaking his shoulder. When he stirred 
she stepped sharply back. She was 
holding a pistol, a revolver of Tirran 
design if not manufacture, and she 
looked as though she knew how to 
use it. She was one of those women 
whose beauty is somehow accentu- 
ated by juxtaposition to lethal iron- 
mongery. Yes, she was an attractive 
wench, with her greenish, transluscent 
skin that did not look at all odd, with 
her fine, strong features, with her 
sleek, short-cut blue hair, with her 
slim yet rounded figure that even the 
rough uniform could not hide. She 
was an officer of some sort, although 
what the silver braid on the sleeves 
of her tunic signified Grimes could 
not guess. Not that he felt in the 
mood for guessing games; he was too 
conscious of his own unshaven scruf- 
finess, of the aches and pains result- 
ing from his athletics of the previous 
night and from the hardness of the 
mattress. 

She said, in fair enough English, 
“Your Mr. Missenden would see 
you.” 

“He’s not my Mr. Missenden,” re- 
plied Grimes, testily. Why should 
everybody ascribe to him the owner- 
ship of the late second officer of 
Rim Dragon? 

“Come,” she said, making an up- 
ward jerking motion of the pistol 
barrel. 

“All right,” grumbled Grimes. “All 
right.” 

He rolled off the narrow bunk, 
staggered slightly as he made his 
way to the washbasin. He splashed 
water over his face, drank some 
from his cupped hands. There was 
no towel. He made do with his hand-

kerchief. As he was drying himself 
he saw that the door was open and 
that a seaman was standing beyond 
it. Any thoughts that he had enter- 
tained of jumping the girl and seizing 
her gun — if he could — evaporated. 

“Follow that man,” she ordered. 
“I will follow you.” 

Grimes followed the man, through 
alleyways and up companionways. 
They came at last to the bridge. 
Missenden was there, striding briskly 
back and forth as though he had been 
at sea all his life. In the wheelhouse 
the helmsman was intent on his task. 
Grimes noted that the standard com- 
pass periscope had been withdrawn 
and that the man was concentrating 
upon the binnacle housing the ocean 
passage compass. So they still used 
that system. But why shouldn’t they? 
It was a good one. He looked out to 
the sea, up to the sky. The morning 
was calm, but the sun was hidden by 
a thick, anticyclonic overcast. The 
surface of the sea was only slightly 
ruffled and there was a low, confused 
swell. 

“Missenden,” called the girl. 
Missenden stopped his pacing, 
walked slowly to the wheelhouse. 
With his dyed hair and skin he looked 
like a Tharnian, a Tangaroan, and 
in his borrowed uniform he looked 
like a seaman. He also looked very 
pleased with himself. 

“Ah, Commodore,” he said, “wel- 
come aboard. You’ve met Miss El- 
levie, I think. Our radio officer.” 
“You’d better tell Miss Ellevie to 
send a message to the High Priest 
for me, Mr. Missenden.” 

Missenden laughed harshly. “I’ll 
say this for you. Commodore, you do 



go on trying. Why not accept the in- 
evitable? You’re in Tangaroan hands. 
In fact you put yourself in their 
— our — hands. The Council of 
Barons has already been informed, 
and they have told me that they want 
you alive. If possible.” 

“Why?” asked Grimes bluntly. 
“Use your loaf. Commodore. First- 
ly, it’s possible that we may be able 
to persuade you to press for the es- 
tablishment of trade relations be- 
tween the Confederacy and Tangaroa. 
You do pile on quite a few G’s in 
this sector of the galaxy, you know. 
Or should I say that you do draw a 
lot of water? And if you play, it 
could be well worth your while.” 
“And if I don’t play?” 

“Then we shall be willing to sell 
you back to your lords and masters. 
At a fair price, of course. A squad- 
ron of armed atmosphere flyers? 
Laser weapons? Missiles with nuclear 
warheads?” 

“That’s for your lords and masters 
to decide.” 

Missenden flushed, and the effect, 
with his green-dyed skin, was an 
odd one. He said to the girl, “That 
will do, Ellevie. I’ll let you know 
when I want you again.” He walked 
out to the wing of the bridge, beckon- 
ing Grimes to follow. When he turn- 
ed to face the commodore he was 
holding a pistol in his right hand. 

H e said, “Don’t try anything. 

When I was in the navy of New 
Saxony I was expert in the use of 
hand guns of all descriptions. But 
I’d like a private talk. Ellevie knows 
English, so I sent her below. The 
man at the wheel may have a smatter-

ing, but he’ll not overhear from 
where we are now.” 

“Well?” asked Grimes coldly. 
“We’re both Earthmen.” 

“/ am, Mr. Missenden.” 

“And I am, by ancestry. These 
Thamians are an inferior breed, but 
if they see that you can be humili- 
ated . .” 

“. they’ll realize that you aren’t 
the galactic superman you set your- 
self up to be.” 

Missenden ignored this, but with 
an effort. He said, “My position in 
this ship is rather . precarious. 
The crew doesn’t trust me. I’m cap- 
tain, yes — but only because I’m the 
only man who can navigate.” 

“But can you?” 

“Yes, damn you! I’ve read the 
textbooks — it was all the bastards 
gave me to read when I was holed 
up down in the secret compartment. 
And anybody who can navigate a 
starship can navigate one of these 
hookers! Anyhow .... Anyhow, 
Commodore, it will be better for 
both of us if we maintain the pre- 
tense that you are a guest rather 
than a prisoner. But I must have 
your parole.” 

“My parole? What can I do?” 
“I’ve heard stories about you.” 
“Have you? Very well, then, what 
about this? I give you my word not 
to attempt to seize this ship.” 

“Good. But not good enough. And 
will you give your word not to signal, 
to aircraft or surface vessels?” 

“Yes,” agreed Grimes. 

“And your word not to interfere, 
in any way, with the ship’s signalling 
equipment?” 

“Yes.” 



“Then, Commodore, I feel that we 
may enjoy quite a pleasant cruise. I 
can’t take you down yet; I relieved 
the lookout for his breakfast. You’ll 
appreciate that we’re rather short- 
handed. As well as the Old Man and 
the three mates, half the deck crew 
was left ashore, and two of the en- 
gineers. I can’t be up here all the 
time, but I have to be here most of 
the time. And the lookouts have or- 
ders to call me at once if they sight 
another ship or an aircraft.” 

“And, as you say, you’re the only 
navigator.” The only human naviga- 
tor, Grimes amended mentally. 

The lookout came back to the 
bridge then, and Missenden took 
Grimes down to what was to be his 
cabin. 

It was a spare room, with its 
own attached toilet facilities, on the 
same deck as the master’s suite — 
which, of course, was now occupied 
by Missenden. It was comfortable, 
and the shower worked, and there 
was even a tube of imported depila- 
tory cream for Grimes to use. After 
he had cleaned up he accompanied 
Missenden down to the saloon, a 
rather gloomy place panelled in dark, 
unpolished timber. Ellevie was al- 
ready seated at one end of the long 
table, and half way along it was an 
officer who had to be an engineer. 
Missenden took his seat at the head 
of the board, motioned to Grimes to 
sit at his right. A steward brought in 
cups and a pot of some steaming, 
aromatic brew, returning with what 
looked like, and tasted like, two deep 
l>lates of fish stew. 

But it wasn’t bad and, in any case, 
it was all that there was.

THE BIRD-BRAINED NAVIGATOR 




A fter the meal Missenden returned 
to the bridge. Grimes accom- 
panied him, followed him into the 
chartroom where he started to potter 
with the things on the chart table. 
Grimes looked at the chart — a small 
scale oceanic one. He noted that the 
Great Circle track was penciled on it, 
that neat crosses marked the plotting 
of dead reckoning positions at four- 
hourly intervals. He looked from it 
to the ticking log clock on the for- 
ward bulkhead. He asked, “This sub- 
merged log of yours. Does it run 
fast or slow?” 

“I — I don’t know, Commodore. 
But if the sky clears and I get some 
sights. I’ll soon find out.” 

“You think you’ll be able to?” 
“Yes. I’ve always been good with 
languages, and I’ve picked up enough 
Tangaroan to be able to find my way 
through the ephemeris and the re- 
duction tables.” 

“Hmm.” Grimes looked at the 
aneroid barometer — another import. 
It was still high. With any luck at 
all the anticyclonic gloom would 
persist for the entire passage. In any 
case, he doubted if Missenden’s first 
attempt to obtain a fix with sextant 
and chronometer would be successful. 

He asked, “Do you mind if I have 
a look round the ship? As you know, 
I'm something of an authority on the 
history of marine transport . 

“I do mind!” snapped Missenden. 
Then he laughed abruptly. “But what 
could you do? Even if you hadn’t 
given your parole, what could you 
do? All the same, I’ll send Ellevie 
with you. And I warn you, that gi^I 
is liable to be trigger happy.” 

“Have you known her long?” 



Missenden scowled. “Too long. 
She’s the main reason why I’m here.” 

Yes, thought Grimes, the radio of- 
ficer of a merchant vessel is well 
qualified for secret service work, and 
when the radio officer is also an 
attractive woman . • . He felt sorry 
for Missenden, but only briefly. He’d 
had his fun; now he was paying for 
it. 

Missenden went down with Grimes 
to the officers’ flat, found Ellevie in 
her room. She got up from her chair 
without any great enthusiasm, took 
from a drawer in her desk a revolver, 
thrust it into the side pocket of her 
tunic. “I’ll leave you to it,” said Miss- 
enden. 

“All right,” she said in a flat voice. 
Then, to Grimes, “What do you want 
to see?” 

“I was on this world years ago,” 
he told her. 

“I know,” 

“And I was particularly impressed 
by the . the ocean passage com- 
passes you had, even then, in your 
ships. Of course, it was all sail in 
those days.” 

“Were you?” 

Grimes started pouring on the 
charm. “No other race in the galaxy 
has invented such ingenious instru- 
ments.” 

“No?” She was beginning to show 
a flicker of interest. “And did you 
know. Commodore Grimes, that it 
was not a wonderful priest who made 
the first one? No. It was not. It was 
a Baron Lennardi, one of my an- 
cestors. He was — how do you put 
it? A man who hunts with birds?” 

“A falconer.” 

“A falconer?” she repeated dubi- 



152 



IF 




cusly. “No matter. He had never 
been to the University, but he had 
clever artisans in his castle, and his 
brother, whom he loved, was a . 
how do you say sea raider?” 

“A pirate.” 

She took a key from a hook by the 
side of her desk. “Second mate looks 
after compass,” she said. “But sec- 
ond mate not here. So . I do 
everything.” 

S he led the way out into the alley- 
way, then to a locked door at 
the forward end of the officers’ ac- 
commodation, to a room exactly on 
the centerline of the ship, directly 
below the wheelhouse. She unlocked 
and opened the door, hooked it back. 
From inside came an ammoniacal 
odor. In the center of the deck was 
a cage, and in the cage was a bird — 
a big, ugly creature, dull gray in col- 
or, with ruffled plumage. It was ob- 
vious that its wings had been brutally 
amputated rather than merely clip- 
ped, Its almost globular body was 
imprisoned in a metallic harness, and 
from this cage within a cage a thin 
yet rigid shaft ran directly upwards, 
through the deckhead and. Grimes 
knew, through a casing in the mas- 
ter’s day cabin and, finally, to the 
card of the ocean passage compass. 
As Grimes watched, Ellevie took a 
bottle of water from a rack poured 
some into a little trough that formed 
part of the harness. Then from a 
box she took a spoonful of some 
stinking brown powder, added it to 
the water. The bird ignored her. It 
seemed to be looking at something, 
for something, something beyond the 
steel bulkhead that was its only hori- 



zon, something beyond the real hori- 
zon that lay forward and outside of 
the metal wall. Its scaly feet scrabbled 
on the deck as it made a minor ad- 
justment of course. 

And it — or its forebears — had 
been the only compasses when 
Grimes had first come to this planet. 
Even though the Earthmen had in- 
troduced the magnetic compass and 
the gyro compass this, for an ocean 
passage, was still the most efficient. 

Cruelty to animals is penalized 
only when commercial interests are 
not involved. 

“And your spares?” asked Grimes. 

“Homeward spare — right for- 
ward,” she told him. “Ausiphal com- 
pass and one spare — right aft.” 

“So you don’t get them mixed?” 
he suggested. 

She smiled contemptuously. “No 
danger of that.” 

“Can I see them?” 

“Why not? May as well feed them 
now.” 

She almost pushed Grimes out of 
the master compass room, followed 
him and locked the door. She led 
the way to the poop — but Grimes 
noticed that a couple of unpleasant- 
looking seamen tailed after him. 
Even though the word had been 
passed that he had given his parole 
he was not trusted. 

The Ausiphal birds were in a cage 
in the poop house. As was the ease 
with the Tangaroa birds, their wings 
had been amputated. Both of them 
were staring dejectedly directly astern. 
And both of them — even though 
dull and ruffled their plumage glowed 
with gold and scarlet — were fe- 
males. 



THE BIRD-BRAINED NAVIGATOR 



153 




Grimes followed Ellevie into the 
cage, the door to which was at the 
forward end of the structure. He 
made a pretense of watching interest- 
edly as she doled out the water and 
the odoriferous powder — and pick- 
ed up two golden tail feathers from 
the filthy deck. She straightened and 
turned abruptly. “What you want 
those for?” 

“Flies,” he lied inspiredly. “Dry 
flies.” 

“Flies?” 

“They’re artificial lures, actually. 
Bait. Used for fishing.” 

“Nets,” she stated. “Or explo- 
sives.” 

“Not for sport. We use a rod, and 
a line on the end of it, and the hook 
and the bait on the end of that And 
fishermen are always experimenting 
with different baits.” 

The suspicion faded from her face. 
“Yes, I remember. Missenden gave 
me a book — a magazine? It was 
all about outdoor sports. But this 
fishing .... Crazyl” 

“Other people have said it, too. 
But I’d just like to see what sort of 
flies I can tie with these feathers 
when I get home.” 

“If you get home,” she said nastily. 

V 

B ack in his cabin. Grimes went 
over mentally what he had learn- 
ed about the homers — that was as 
good a translation as any of their 
native name — during his last (his 
only, until now) visit to Tham. They 
were land birds, but fared far out to 
sea in search of their food, which 
was fish. They always found their 



way back to their nests, even when 
blown thousands of miles away by 
severe storms, their powers of eMur- 
ance being phenomenal. Also, when- 
ever hurt or frightened, they headed 
unerringly for home — by the short- 
est possible route, which was a Great 
Circle course. 

Used as master compasses, they 
kept the arrowhead on the card of 
the steering compass pointed directly 
towards wherever it was that they 
had been bom — even when that 
“wherever” was a breeding pen in 
one of the seaport towns. On a Mer- 
catorial chart the track would be a 
curve, and according to a magnetic 
or gyro compass the ship would be 
continually changing course — but 
on a globe a Great Circle is the short- 
est distance between two points. 

Only one instinct did they possess 
that was more powerful, more over- 
riding than the homing instinct. 

The sex instinct. 

G rimes had given his parole. 

Grimes had promised not to do 
certain things — and those things, 
he knew, were rather beyond his 
present capabilities in any case. But 
Grimes, as one disgruntled Rini Run- 
ners’ master had once remarked, was 
a stubborn old bastard. And Grimes, 
as the admiral commanding the navy 
of the Rim Worlds Confederacy had 
once remarked, was a cunning old 
bastard. Sonya, his wife, had laughed 
when told of these two descriptions 
of her husband and had laughed still 
louder when he had said plaintively 
that he didn’t like to be called old. 

Nonetheless, he was getting past 
the age for cloak and dagger work.

IF 




mutiny on the high seas and all the 
rest of it. But he could still use his 
brains. 

Kawaroa*s short-handedness was a 
help. If the ship had been normally 
manned he would have foimd it hard, 
if not impossible, to carry out his 
plan. But, insofar as the officers* flat 
was concerned, the two engineers 
were on watch and watch, and off 
watch would be catching up on lost 
sleep. That left Ellevie. But she had 
watches to keep, and one of these 
two-hour stretches of duty coincided 
with and overlapped evening twilight. 
Missenden was not a watchkeeper, 
but he was, as he was always saying, 
the only navigator, and on this eve- 
ning there seemed to be the possibili- 
ty of breaks appearing in the over- 
cast. There had been one or two dur- 
ing the day, but never where the sun 
happened to be. And, insofar as eve- 
ning stars were concerned, out here, 
on the Rim, there were so very few. 
On a clear evening there would have 
been three, and three only, suitably 
placed for obtaining a fix. On this 
night the odds were against even one 
of the three appearing in a rift in the 
clouds before the horizon was gone. 

Anyhow, there was Missenden, on 
the bridge, sextant in hand, the lid of 
the chronometer box in the chart- 
room open, making an occasional 
gallop from one wing to the other 
when it seemed that a star might 
make a fleeting appearance. Grimes 
asked if he might help, if he could 
take the navigator’s times for him. 
Missenden said no, adding that the 
wrong times would be no help at all. 
Grimes looked hurt, went down to 
the boat deck, strolled aft. The radio 



shack was abaft the funnel. He look- 
ed in, just to make sure that Ellevie 
was there. She was, and she was tap- 
ping out a message to somebody. 
Grimes tried to read it — then rea- 
lized that even if the code was Morse 
the text would be in Tangaroan. 

He went down to the officers’ flat. 
All lights, with the exception of the 
dim police bulbs in the alleyways, 
were out. From one of the cabins 
came the sound of snoring. He found 
Ellevie’s room without any trouble; 
he had been careful to memorize the 
squiggle over her door that meant 
Radio Officer, He walked to the desk, 
put his hand along the side of it. 
Yes, the key was there. Or a key. 
But it was the only one. He lifted it 
from its hook, stepped back into the 
alleyway, made his way forward. 

Yes, it was the right key. He open- 
ed the door, shut it behind him, then 
groped for the light switch. The 
maimed, ugly bird ignored him; it was 
still straining at its harness, still 
scrabbling now and again at the deck 
as it made some infinitesimal adjust- 
ment of course. It ignored him — 
until he pulled one of thp female’s 
tail feathers from his pocket. It 
squawked loudly then, its head turn- 
ing on its neck to point at the new, 
potent attraction, its clumsy body 
straining to follow. But Grimes was 
quick. His arm, his hand holding the 
feather shot out, steadied over the 
brass strip let into the deck that 
marked the ship’s centerline. 

But it had been close, and he had 
been stupid. The man at the wheel 
would have noticed if the compass 
card had suddenly swung a full ninety 
degrees to starboard — and even 



THE BIRD-BRAINED NAVIGATOR 



155 




^ssenden would have noticed if the 
ship had followed suit. (And would 
he notice the discrepancies between 
magnetic compass and ocean passage 
compass? Did he ever compare com- 
passes? Probably not. According to 
Captain Dingwall he was the sort of 
navigator who takes far too much 
for granted.) 

Grimes, before Missenden had or- 
dered him off the bridge, had been 
able to study the chart. He assumed 
— he had to assume — that the last 
Dead Reckoning position was reason- 
ably accurate. In that case, if the 
ship flew off at a tangent, as it were, 
from her Great Circle, if, as and 
from now she followed a rhumb line, 
she would miss the north coast of 
Tangaroa by all of a hundred miles. 
And if she missed that coast, another 
day’s steaming would bring her into 
the territorial waters of Braziperu. 
There was probably some sort of 
coastal patrol, and even though sur- 
face and airships would not be look- 
ing for Kawaroa her description 
would have been sent out. 

The rack containing water and 
food containers was on the forward 
bulkhead of the master compass 
room. It was secured to the plating 
with screws, and between wood and 
metal there was a gap. Grimes push- 
ed the quill of the feather into this 
crack, being careful to keep it exactly 
over the brass lubber’s line. He re- 
membered that the male homer had 
paid no attention to the not-so-artifi- 
cial lure until he pulled it out of his 
pocket. Had his own body masked 
the smell of it? Or was there a smell, 
or was it some more subtle emana- 
tion? He recalled then that he had 



learned that the male birds must be 
kept beyond a minimum distance 
from the females, no matter what in- 
tervened in the way of decks or bulk- 
heads. So ... ? His own masculine 
aura...? The fact that he had put 
the feathers in the pocket that he 
usually kept his pipe in ... ? 

He decided to leave the merest tip 
of the feather showing, nonetheless. 
He had noted that Ellevie went 
through her master compass tending 
routine with a certain lack of en- 
thusiasm; probably she would think 
that the tiny touch of gold was just 
another speck on the paintwork. 

He waited in the foul-smelling 
compartment for what seemed like 
far too long a time. But he had to 
be sure. He decided, at last, that his 
scheme was working. Before plant- 
ing of the feather, the maimed bird 
had been shifting to starboard, the 
merest fraction of a degree at a time, 
continually. Now it was motionless, 
just straining at its harness. 

Grimes put out the light, let him- 
self out, locked up, then returned the 
key to EUevie’s cabin. He went back 
up to the bridge, looked into the 
chartroom. It seemed that Missenden 
had been able to take one star, but 
that his sums were refusing to come 
out right. 

T he voyage wore on. It was not 
a happy one, especially for 
Grimes. There was nothing to read 
and nobody to talk to except Missen- 
den and Ellevie — and the former 
was all too prone to propagandize on 
behalf of the galactic supermen, 
while the latter treated Grimes with 
contempt. He was pleased to note.

however, that they seemed to be get- 
ting on each other’s nerves. The hon- 
eymoon, such as it had been, was 
almost over. 

The voyage wore on. No other 
ships were sighted, and the heavily 
clouded weather persisted. Once or 
twice the sun showed through^ and 
once Missenden was able to obtain 
a sight, to work out a position line. 
It was very useful as a check of dis- 
tance run, being almost at right an- 
gles to the courseline. 

“We shall,” announced Missenden 
proudly, “make our landfall tomor- 
row forenoon.” 

“Are you sure?” asked Grimes 
mildly. 

“Of course I’m sure.” He prodded 
with the points of his dividers at the 
chart. “LookI Within five miles of 
the D.R.” 

“Mphm,” grunted Grimes. 

“Cheer up. Commodore! As long 
as you play ball with the barons they 
won’t boil you in oil. All you have 
to do is be reasonable.” 

“I’m always reasonable,” said 
Grimes. “The trouble is that too 
many other people aren’t.” 

The other man laughed. “We’ll see 
what the Council of Barons has to 
say about that. I don’t bear you any 
malice — well, not much — but I 
hope I’m allowed to watch when they 
bring you around to their way of 
thinking.” 

“I hope you never have the pleas- 
ure,” snapped Grimes, going below 
to his cabin. 

The trouble was that he was not 
sure. Tomorrow could be arrival day 
at Port Paraparam on Tangaroa. It 
could be. It could not. If be started 



taking too much interest in the navi- 
gation of the ship — if, for example, . 
he took it upon himself to compare 
compasses — his captors would at 
once smell a rat. He recalled twenti- 
eth-century sea stories he bad read, 
yarns in which people, either goodies 
or baddies, had thrown ships off 
course by hiding an extra magnet in 
the vicinity of the steering compass 
binnacle. There had even been one 
in which the hero had achieved the 
desired effect by sticking a weight 
under the north pole of the gyro 
compass rotor with chewing gum, 
thus introducing some most peculiar 
precession. Those old bastards had it 
easy, he thought. Magnetism is 
straightforward, it*s not like playing 
around with the tail feathers of a 
stupid bird. 

He did not sleep well that night 
and was up on bridge, before break- 
fast, with Missenden. Through a pair 
of binoculars he scanned the horizon, 
but nothing was there, no distant 
peaks in silhouette against the pale 
morning sky. 

The two men were up on the 
" bridge again after breakfast. Still 
there was nothing ahead but sea and 
sky. Missenden was beginning to look 
worried — and Grimes’s spirits had 
started to rise. Neither of them went 
down for the midday meal — and it 
was significant that the^ steward did 
not come up to ask if they wanted 
anything. There was something in the 
atmosphere of the ship that was 
ugly, threatening. The watches — 
helmsmen and lookouts — were be- 
coming increasingly surly. 

“I shall stand on,” announced 
Missenden that evening. “I shall

stand on. The coast is well lit, and 
this ship has a good echometer 
“But no radar,"* said Grimes. 

“And whose fault is that?’* flared 
the other. “Your blasted priests’. 
They say that they’ll not introduce 
radar until it can be manufactured 
locally!” 

“There are such things as balance 
of trade to consider,** Grimes told 
him. 

“Balance of trade!” He made it 
sound like an obscenity. Then. “But 
1 can’t understand what went wrong. 
The Dead Reckoning — my ob- 
served position — ” 

“The log could be running fast. 
And what about set? Come to that 
— did you allow for accumulated 
chronometer error?” 

“Of course. In any case, we’ve 
been getting radio time signals.** 

“Arc you sure that you used the 
right date in the ephemeris?*’ 

“Commodore Grimes? As I told 
you before. I’m a good linguist. I can 
read Tangaroan almost as well as 1 
can read En^sh.” 

“What about index error on that 
sextant you were using?” 

“We stand on,” said Missenden 
stubbornly. 

Grimes went down to bis cabin. 
He shut the door and shot the secur- 
ing bolt. He didn’t like the way that 
the crew were looking at the two 
Earthmen. 

VI 

M orning came, and still no land. 

The next morning came, and 
the next. The crew was becoming 
mutinous. To Missenden’s troubles 

THE BIRD-BRAINED NAVIGATOR 



— and he was, by now, ragged from 
lack of sleep — were added a short- 
age of fresh water and the impend- 
ing exhaustion of oil fuel. But he 
stood on, stubbornly. He wore two 
bolstered revolvers aU the time, and 
the other ririp’s firearms were locked 
in the strongroom. And what about 
the one that Ellcvie had be^ waving 
around? wondered Grimes. 

He stood on — and then, late in 
the afternoon, the first dark peak 
was faintly visible against the dark, 
clouded sky. Missenden ru^ed into 
the chartroom, came back out. 
“Mount Rangararol” he declared* 

“Doesn’t look like it,” said Ellevie, 
who had come to the bridge. 

“It must be.” A great weight seem- 
ed to have faBeu from his shoulders. 
“What do you make of it, Commo- 
dorer 

“It’s land,” admitted Grimes. 

“Of course it’s land! And look! 
There on the starboard bow! A ship. 
A cruiser. Come to escort us in.” 

He snapped orders, and Kawaroa*s 
ensign was run up to the gaff, the 
black, mailed fist on the scarlet 
ground. The warship, passing on their 
starboard beam, was too far distant 
for them to see her colors. She turn- 
ed, reduced speed, steering a con- 
verging course. 

The dull boom of her cannon 
came a long while after the flash of 
orange flame from her forward tur- 
ret. Ahead of Kawaroa the exploding 
shell threw up a great fountain of 
spray. It was Grimes, who ran to the 
engmeroom telegraph and rang Stop. 
It was Ellevie, who, dropping her 
binoculars to the dsck, cried, “A 
Braziperuan ship!” Then she pulled 

159 




her revolver from her pocket and 
aimed it at Missenden, yelling, ‘Terry 
traitor!” Unluckily for her she was 
st^ding just in front of Grimes, who 
felled her with a rabbit punch to the 
back of the neck. He crouched, 
scooped up the weapon and straight- 
ened. He said, “You’d better get 
ready to fight your faithful crew 
away from the bridge, Missenden. 
We should be able to hold them off 
until the boarding party arrives.” He 
snapped a shot at the helmsman, who. 



relinquishing his now useless wheel, 
was advancing on them threatenin^y. 
The man turned tail and ran. 

“You’re behind this!” raved Miss- 
enden. “What did you do? You gave 
your parole!” 

“I didn’t do anything that I prom- 
ised not to.” 

“But — what went wrong?” 

Grimes answered with insuffer- 
able smugness. “It was just a case of 
one bird-brained navigator trusting 
another.” END

Dear Editor: 

Re the letter by Mrs. Rhoda Wills 
in your March issue. There is no 
accounting for tastes, of course, and 
perhaps Mrs. Wills’s letter ought 
not even to be dignified by a reply, 
but her attitude is both foolish and 
representative of a section of the 
readdnig public. As far as 1 know 
there has been a running battle 
throughout literary history concern- 
ed with whether literature should 
properly instruct or entertain, and 
no adequate conclusion will ever be 
reached as long as every person is 
permitted his own opinion. There is 
no reason science-fiction, science fan- 
tasy, or pure fantasy should be 
either instructive or entertaining, 
or educational, enlightening, and so 
on; it may be any of these or nonCy 
if the author chooses — but it will 
probably be one. An author should, 
ideally please himself first, and if 
he also pleases the readers who 
choose to read his works, so much 
the better. In other words, the obli- 
gation, if any, is with the reader. 
The newsstands place pornographic 
books on their shelves, but the public 
is not obliged to buy them — any- 
thing else would be more worth 
while. What is needed is a genuine 
discriminative effort on the part of 
each individual reader in deciding 



what is good for him and worthy of 
his attention. In the same light he 
has no right to prescribe for others 
whose tastes may differ. 

In my opinion and acquaintance, 
readers and writers of sf and fan- 
tasy represent the elite of the 
world’s general reading public. Many 
of them may be peculiar (I’m quite 
peculiar myself), but then any se- 
lected group of people will have its 
peculiarities — painters, horse lov- 
ers, dog fanciers, and so on. And 
Mrs. Wills’s irresponsible claim that 
no real scientist or educator would 
uphold what If is printing (and evi- 
dently the entire genre is included) 
is fidmply not in accordance with the 
facts. Writers and readers of science- 
fiction and science fantasy are the 
well educated, are the well informed, 
are in many cases, the scientists of 
this country and other countries. 
And most educators on the univer- 
sity level will not deliberately spurn 
sf; they will usually admit that it 
has literary merits even though tiiey 
may not care for it themselves. 
There is a sf section of the southern 
chapter of the Modem Language 
Association! 

Beyond all this, however, Mrs. 
Wills does have a point. Does sf 
owe anything to its adherents? Per- 
haps so, in some cases, and I shall 



161 




iise televisioii isf as an example. Both 
The Invaders and Star Trek serve 
an infoimative end, VTihatever theor 
design may be. Bnt another show. 
Lost in Space, (has fallen on bad 
times. In three years the series has 
shifted from a semi-scientific basis 
to a fanitastie. The principals, now 
are a Hattie boy, a strangely emotion- 
al robot and a psendo^octor, who, 
despite the fact that he is despicable, 
cowardly, greedy, and cruel when 
necessary, is made to retain our in- 
terest and even sympathy. He has 
become ithe hero of the program, 
and this is truly insidious, because 
it is not sufflieiently clear that he 
is a non-hero or anti-hero. He re- 
ceives little or no punishment and 
is rewarded more often than not by 
oontiiiiied acceptance of his crimes. 
Where are the vndues here? If there 
are any, they have become warped 
out of countoiance. 

Against this, however, we have the 
truly magnificent fantasies of E. R. 
Burroagh^ who has given the world, 
in Taa^an, a quasi-realistic figure 
that has, in a short fifty years, be- 
come a popnlar hero representing 
good to rank with or above King 
Arthur and Robin Hood. Yet Tarzan 
books are escapism in the purest 
form. What have they to do with the 
real problems and responsib^ities of 
today’s and tomorrow’s world. Any 
young boy has missed one of the ex- 
periences of childhood if he never 
reads a Tarzan book. And I can also 
mention the works of Andre Norton, 
L. Spraigue de Gamp, A. Merritt, 
Jack Vance, and — the list is end- 
less. Sherlock Holmes is no less 
wonderful because he is a fantasy 
hero, of sorts ; I can say all this and 
still admit th^ fantasy and the re- 
cent sword and sorcery are not my 
favorites. Credit must be given 



where it is due — a story stands on 
its own merits, or should if it does 
not. What is needed, once again, is 
an individual ability to discern and 
discriminate; if we do not possess 
these talents strongly, we should 
practice them. 

Well, now, I did not start out to 
write the decisive essay on tins sub- 
ject, and, despite the length, I can 
see that I have not done so. But it 
is important that we leam to judge 
literature of all kinds with some- 
thing more than iigtnorance and our 
own predispositions. If there does 
exist an inability to separate fact 
and fancy, we should look farther 
than our writers and editors for a 
reason. Science fiction is not all 
bad, bnt neither is it all good, as 
some of the fans apparency feel. 
There is a wider scale of comparison 
than greatl terrific! and Wow! 

Oongratulations on a fine sf mag- 
azine and a steadily better letter 
section. — James M. Gale, 7100

Dear Sir: 

As most of your readers probably 
already know, NBG has renewed 
“Star Trek” for the 1968-69 season. 
It is a pleasure to offer a third sea- 
son of this imagiinative series. 

While we were formulating next 
season’s schedule, more than 100,000 
viewers — one of the largest totals 
in our history — wrote or wired 
their support for “Star Trek.” Ob- 
viously, it is not possible to answer 
such a large volume of mail individ- 
ually, so I, therefore, extend a gen- 
eral thanks on behalf of NBG man^ 
agement to your readers who took 
the time and trouble to communicate 
with us. The response was gratify- 
ing, — Mort Werner, Vice President, 
NBC Television, New York, N.Y.
