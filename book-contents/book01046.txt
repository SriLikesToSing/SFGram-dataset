Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation. Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try it this way, Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets. Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Flum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting." 

"And you've been trying to discover why GALAXY is growing 
so popular? Every idea we've mentioned— and a lot more, be- 
sides— is treated dramatically and vividly in GALAXY! You really 
live them!" 

"Umm. How do I subscribe? After all, one shouldn't resist a 
trend, should one? Heh, heh!" 

"Just fill out the coupon— or make out your own order and 
send it in. The coupon's for your convenience, not ours. And now 
you'll be one of us!"

WAX & WANE 



"D emembering my editorials 
proving There Are Aliens 
Among Us, an alarmed reader 
sent me an article from Travel 
Magazine with the shaky mes- 
sage: “The plot thickens!!!” In 
the article, Dolph Sharp declares: 
“I first began to wonder why 
my luggage weighed more on the 
return trip only after it had 
happened the fifth time in a row. 
I was being checked through the 
airport on my way home and the 
clerk looked up from weighing 
my one bag. 

“‘You’re three pounds over.’” 
“‘What!’ I cried. I am given 
to crying under such circumstan- 
ces. The bag had only weighed 
39 pounds on my going trip. I 
bought a trinket or two that 
couldn’t weigh more than six- 
seven ounces, but on the other 
hand I had lost a pair of socks, 
a necktie and one shoe. 

“If anything, the balance should 
have been in my favor.” 

Naturally, it wasn’t. Checking 
with other travelers, Sharp found 
they had the same puzzling ex- 
periences each time they came 
back on a plane. 

Unfortunately, his attempts to 
guess how come only eliminated 
possibilities: that the airlines tam- 

4 



pered with their scales; that lug- 
gage could “somehow trap and 
preserve and expand with fumes 
and steams and essences” so that 
a suitcase could “retain the New 
Yorkness of New York;” the opin- 
ion of a physicist that one gener- 
ally has clothes cleaned before 
a trip, not on returning; and, with 
a note of despair, Sharp asks the 
reader for the answer. 

I doubt if he’ll get it from them; 
they have not been collecting 
data as I have done. The problem 
is much more confusing than he 
thinks, for we are dealing with 
two phenomena: gain and loss. 

To add to Sharp’s half of the 
question: 

Overweight people will testify 
that a single bite of something 
fattening adds a pound or more. 

According to logic, you should 
weigh, dressed, exactly as much 
as your stripped weight plus the 
weight of your clothing. Tests by 
independent laboratories, how- 
ever, show that you weigh more 
dressed. 

Unless a large roast (bird or 
meat) is eaten at one sitting, it 
gains weight each day, regardless 
of the number of sandwiches, 
salads, hash and other leftover

The Native Problem 

Plenty of room in space for every misfit? 
Sheer propaganda— Danton discovered there 
was less room in space than anywhere else! 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

E dward danton was a 

misfit. Even as a baby, he 
had shown pre-anti-social 
leanings. This should have been 
sufficient warning to his parents, 
whose duty it was to take him 
without delay to a competent pre- 
pubescent psychologist. Such a 
man could have discovered what 
lay in Danton’s childhood to give 
him these contra-group tenden- 
cies. But Danton’s parents, doubt- 
less dramatizing problems of their 
own, thought the child would 
grow out of it. 

He never did. 

In school, Danton got barely 
passing grades in Group Accul- 
turation, Sibling Fit, Values Rec- 
ognition, Folkways Judgment and 
other subjects which a person 
must know in order to live se- 
renely in the modern world. Be- 
cause of his lack of comprehen- 
sion, Danton could never live 
serenely in the modem world.

THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



7 



It took him a while to find this 
out. 

From his appearance, one 
would never have guessed Dan- 
ton’s basic lack of Fit. He was a 
tall, athletic young man, green- 
eyed, easy-going. There was a cer- 
tain something about him which 
considerably intrigued the girls in 
his immediate affective environ- 
ment. In fact, several paid him 
the highest compliment at their 
command, which was to consider 
him as a possible husband. 

But even the flightiest girl could 
not ignore Danton’s lacks. He was 
liable to weary after only a few 
hours of Mass Dancing, when the 
fun was just beginning. At 
Twelve-hand Bridge, Danton’s at- 
tention frequently wandered and 
he would be forced to ask for a 
recount of the bidding, to the dis- 
gust of the other eleven players. 
And he was impossible at Sub- 
ways. 

TT E TRIED hard to master the 
spirit of that classic game. 
Locked arm in arm with his team- 
mates, he would thrust forward 
into the subway car, trying to take 
possession before another team 
could storm in the opposite doors. 

His group captain would shout, 
“Forward, men! We’re taking this 
car to Rockaway!” And the oppos- 
ing group captain would scream 
back, “Never! Rally, boys! It’s 
Bronx Park or bust!” 



Danton would struggle in the 
close-packed throng, a fixed smile 
on his face, worry lines etched 
around his mouth and eyes. His 
girl friend of the moment would 
say, “What’s wrong, Edward? 
Aren’t you having fun?” 

“Sure I am,” Danton would re- 
ply, gasping for breath. 

“But you aren’t!” the girl would 
cry, perplexed. “Don’t you realize, 
Edward, that this is the way our 
ancestors worked off their aggres- 
sions? Historians say that the 
game of Subways averted an all- 
out hydrogen war. We have those 
same aggressions and we, too, 
must resolve them in a suitable 
social context.” 

“Yeah, I know,” Edward Dan- 
ton would say. “I really do enjoy 
this. I — oh, Lord!” 

For at that moment, a third 
group would come pounding in, 
arms locked, chanting, “Canarsie, 
Canarsie, Canarsie!” 

In that way, he would lose an- 
other girl friend, for there was ob- 
viously no future in Danton. Lack 
of Fit can never be disguised. It 
was obvious that Danton would 
never be happy in the New York 
suburbs which stretched from 
Rockport, Maine, to Norfolk, Vir- 
ginia; nor in any other suburbs, 
for that matter. 

Danton tried to cope with his 
problems, in vain. Other strains 
started to show. He began to de- 
velop astigmatism from the pro- 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



jection of advertisements on his 
retina, and there was a constant 
ringing in his ears from the sing- 
swoop ads. His doctor warned 
that symptom analysis would 
never rid him of these psychoso- 
matic ailments. No, what had to 
be treated was Danton’s basic 
neurosis, his anti-sociality. But 
this Danton found impossible to 
deal with. 

And so his thoughts turned ir- 
resistibly to escape. There was 
plenty of room for Earth’s misfits 
out in space. 

T\URING the last two centu- 
ries, millions of psychotics, 
neurotics, psychopaths, and cranks 
of every kind and description had 
gone outward to the stars. The 
early ones had the Mikkelsen 
Drive to power their ships, and 
spent twenty or thirty years chug- 
ging from star system to star sys- 
tem. The newer ships were pow- 
ered by GM subspatial torque 
converters, and made the same 
journey in a matter of months. 

The stay-at-homes, being so- 
cially adjusted, bewailed the loss 
of anyone, but they welcomed the 
additional breeding room. 

In his twenty-seventh year, 
Danton decided to leave Earth 
and take up pioneering. It was a 
tearful day when he gave his 
breeding certificate to his best 
friend, A1 Trevor. 

“Gee, Edward,” Trevor said, 

THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



turning the precious little certifi- 
cate over and over in his hands, 
“you don’t know what this means 
to Myrtle and me. We always 
wanted two kids. Now because of 
you — ” 

“Forget it,” said Danton. 
“Where I’m going, I won’t need 
any breeding permit. As a matter 
of fact, I’ll probably find it impos- 
sible to breed,” he added, the 
thought having just struck him. 

“But won’t that be frustrating 
for you?” A1 asked, always solici- 
tous for his friend’s welfare. 

“I guess so. Maybe after a 
while, though, I’ll find a girl pio- 
neer. And in the meantime, there’s 
always sublimation.” 

“True enough. What substitute 
have you selected?” 

“Vegetable gardening. I might 
as well be practical.” 

“You might as well,” A1 said, 
“Well, boy, good luck, boy.” 

Once the breeding certificate 
was gone, the die was cast. Dan- 
ton plunged boldly ahead. In ex- 
change for his Birthright, the gov- 
ernment gave him unlimited free 
transportation and two years’ 
basic equipment and provisions. 
Danton left at once. 

IJE AVOIDED the more heav- 
ily populated areas, which 
were usually in the hands of rabid 
little groups. 

He wanted no part of a place 
like Korani II, for instance, where 

9 



a giant calculator had instituted 
a reign of math. 

Nor was he interested in Heil 
V, where a totalitarian population 
of 342 was earnestly planning 
ways and means of conquering 
the Galaxy. 

He skirted the Farming Worlds, 
dull, restrictive places given to 
extreme health theories and prac- 
tices. 

When he came to Hedonia, he 
considered settling on that noto- 
rious planet. But the men of He- 
donia were said to be short-lived, 
although no one denied their en- 
joyment while they did live. 

Danton decided in favor of the 
long haul, and journeyed on. 

He passed the Mining Worlds, 
somber, rocky places sparsely 
populated by gloomy, bearded 
men given to sudden violence. 
And he came at last to the New 
Territories. These unpeopled 
worlds were past Earth’s farthest 
frontier. Danton scanned several 
before he found one with no intel- 
ligent life whatsoever. 

It was a calm and watery place, 
dotted with sizable islands, lush 
with jungle green and fertile with 
fish and game. The ship’s captain 
duly notarized Danton’s claim to 
the planet, which Danton called 
New Tahiti. A quick survey 
showed a large island superior to 
the rest. Here he was landed, and 
here he proceeded to set up his 
camp. 



There was much to be done at 
first. Danton constructed a house 
out of branches and woven grass, 
near a white and gleaming beach. 
He fashioned a fishing spear, sev- 
eral snares and a net. He planted 
his vegetable garden and was grat- 
ified to see it thrive under the 
tropic sun, nourished by warm 
rains which fell every morning be- 
tween seven and seven-thirty. 

All in all, New Tahiti was a 
paradisical place and Danton 
should have been very happy 
there. But there was one thing 
wrong. 

The vegetable garden, which 
he had thought . would provide 
first-class sublimation, proved a 
dismal failure. Danton found him- 
self thinking about women at all 
hours of the day and night, and 
spending long hours crooning to 
himself — love songs, of course — 
beneath a great orange tropic 
moon. 

This was unhealthy. Desper- 
ately he threw himself into other 
recognized forms of sublimation; 
painting came first, but he re- 
jected it to keep a journal, aban- 
doned that and composed a so- 
nata, gave that up and carved two 
enormous statues out of a local 
variety of soapstone, completed 
them and tried to think of some- 
thing else to do. 

There was nothing else to do. 
His vegetables took excellent care 
of themselves; being of Earth 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stock, they completely choked out 
all alien growths. Fish swam into 
his nets in copious quantities, and 
meat was his whenever he both- 
ered to set a snare. He found 
again that he was thinking of 
women at all hours of the day and 
night— tall women, short women, 
white women, black women, 
brown women. 

The day came when Danton 
found himself thinking favorably 
of Martian women, something no 
Terran had succeeded in doing 
before. Then he knew that some- 
thing drastic had to be done. 

But what? He had no way of 
signaling for help, no way of get- 
ting off New Tahiti. He was 
gloomily contemplating this when 
a black speck appeared in the sky 
to seaward. 

He watched as it slowly grew 
larger, barely able to breathe for 
fear it would turn out to be a bird 
or huge insect. But the speck con- 
tinued to increase in size and soon 
he could see pale jets, flaring and 
ebbing. 

A spaceship had come! He was 
alone no longer! 

r |PHE ship took a long, slow, 
cautious time landing. Danton 
changed into his best pareu, a 
South Seas garment he had found 
peculiarly well adapted to the cli- 
mate of New Tahiti. He washed, 
combed his hair carefully and 
watched the ship descend. 



It was one of the ancient Mik- 
kelsen Drive ships. Danton had 
thought that all of them were 
long retired from active service. 
But this ship, it was apparent, had 
been traveling for a long while. 
The hull was dented and scored, 
hopelessly archaic, yet with a cer- 
tain indomitable look about it. 
Its name, proudly lettered on the 
bow, was The Hutter People. 

When people come in from deep 
space, they are usually starved for 
fresh food. Danton gathered a 
great pile of fruit for the ship’s 
passengers and had it tastefully 
arranged by the time The Hutter 
People had landed ponderously 
on the beach. 

A narrow hatch opened and 
two men stepped out. They were 
armed with rifles and dressed in 
black from head to toe. Warily 
they looked around them. 

Danton sprinted over. “Hey, 
welcome to New Tahiti! Boy, am 
I glad to see you folks! What’s the 
latest news from—” 

“Stand back!” shouted one of 
the men. He was in his fifties, tall 
and impossibly gaunt, his face 
seamed and hard. His icy blue 
eyes seemed to pierce Danton like 
an arrow; his rifle was leveled at 
Danton’s chest. His partner was 
younger, barrel-chested, broad- 
faced, short and very powerfully 
built. 

“Something wrong?” Danton 
asked, stopping. 



THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



11 



“What’s your name?” 

“Edward Danton.” 

“I’m Simeon Smith,” the gaunt 
man said, “military commander of 
the Hutter people. This is Jede- 
kiah Franker, second-in-command. 
How come you speak English?” 
“I’ve always spoken English,” 
said Ddnton. “Look, I — ” 

“Where are the others? Where 
are they hiding?” 

“There aren’t any others. Just 
me.” Danton looked at the ship 
and saw the faces of men and 
women at every port. “I gathered 
this stuff for you folks.” He waved 
his hand at the mound of fruit. 
“Thought you might want some 
fresh goods after being so long in 
space.” 

A pretty girl with short, tousled 
blonde hair appeared in the 
hatchway. “Can’t we come out 
now, Father?” 

“No!” Simeon said. “It’s not 
safe. Get inside, Anita.” 

“I’ll watch from here, then,” she 
said, staring at Danton with 
frankly curious eyes. 

Danton stared back and a faint 
and unfamiliar tremor ran 
through him. 

S IMEON said, “We accept your 
offering. We will not, how- 
ever, eat it.” 

“Why not?” Danton reasonably 
wanted to know. 

“Because,” said Jedekiah, “we 
don’t know what poisons you peo- 



ple might try to feed us.” 

“Poisons? Look, let’s sit down 
and talk this over.” 

“What do you think?” Jedekiah 
asked Simeon. 

“Just what I expected,” the 
military leader said. “Ingratiating, 
fawning, undoubtedly treacherous. 
His people won’t show them- 
selves. Waiting in ambush, I’ll bet. 
I think an object lesson would be 
in order.” 

“Right,” said Jedekiah, grin- 
ning. “Put the fear of civilization 
into them.” He aimed his rifle at 
Danton’s chest. 

“Hey!” Danton yelped, backing 
away. 

“But, Father,” said Anita, “he 
hasn’t done anything yet.” 

“That’s the whole point. Shoot 
him and he won’t do anything. 
The only good native is a dead 
native.” 

“This way,” Jedekiah put in, 
“the rest will know we mean busi- 
ness.” 

“It isn’t right!” Anita cried in- 
dignantly. “The Council — ” 

“—isn’t in command now. An 
alien landfall constitutes an emer- 
gency. During such times, the 
military is in charge. We’ll do 
what we think best. Remember 
Lan II!” 

“Hold on now,” Danton said. 
“You’ve got this all wrong. There’s 
just me, no others, no reason to — ” 

A bullet kicked sand near his 
left foot. He sprinted for the pro- 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tection of the jungle. Another bul- 
let whined close and a third cut a 
twig near his head as he plunged 
into the underbrush. 

“There!” he heard Simeon roar. 
“That ought to teach them a les- 
son!” 

Danton kept on running until 
he had put half a mile of jungle 
between himself and the pioneer 
ship. 

He ate a light supper of the lo- 
cal variety of bananas and bread- 
fruit, and tried to figure out what 
was wrong with the Hutters. Were 
they insane? They had seen that 
he was an Earthman, alone and 
unarmed, obviously friendly. Yet 
they had fired at him — as an ob- 
ject lesson. A lesson for whom? 
For the dirty natives, whom they 
wanted to teach a lesson . 

That was it! Danton nodded 
emphatically to himself. The Hut- 
ters must have thought he was a 
native, an aboriginal, and that his 
tribe was lurking in the bush, 
waiting for a chance to massacre 
the new arrivals! It wasn’t too 
rash an assumption, really. Here 
he was on a distant planet, with- 
out a spaceship, wearing only a 
loincloth and tanned a medium 
bronze. He was probably just 
what they thought a native should 
look like on a wilderness planet 
like this! 

“But where,” Danton asked him- 
self, “do they think I learned 
English?” 

THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



r T'HE whole thing was ridicu- 
lous. He started walking back 
to the ship, sure he could clear up 
the misunderstanding in a few 
minutes. But after a couple yards, 
he stopped. 

Evening was approaching. Be- 
hind him, the sky was banked in 
white and gray clouds. To sea- 
ward, a deep blue haze advanced 
steadily on the land. The jungle 
was filled with ominous noises, 
which Danton had long ago found 
to be harmless. But the new ar- 
rivals might not think so. 

These people were trigger- 
happy, he reminded himself. No 
sense barging in on them too fast 
and inviting a bullet. 

So he moved cautiously through 
the tangled jungle growth, a si- 
lent, tawny shape blending into 
the jungle -browns and greens. 
When he reached the vicinity of 
the ship, he crawled through the 
dense undergrowth until he could 
peer down on the sloping beach. 

The pioneers had finally come 
out of their ship. There were sev- 
eral dozen men and women and 
a few children. All were dressed 
in heavy black cloth and perspir- 
ing in the heat. They had ignored 
his gift of local fruit. Instead, an 
aluminum table had been spread 
with the spaceship’s monotonous 
provisions. 

On the periphery of the crowd, 
Danton saw several men with 
rifles and ammunition belts. They 

13 



were evidently on guard, keeping 
close watch on the jungle and 
glancing apprehensively overhead 
at the darkening sky. 

Simeon raised his hands. There 
was immediate silence. 

“Friends,” the military leader 
orated, “we have come at last to 
our long-awaited home! Behold, 
here is a land of milk and honey, 
a place of bounty and abundance. 
Was it not worth the long voyage, 
the constant danger, the endless 
search?” 

“Yes, brother!” the people re- 
sponded. 

Simeon held up his hands again 
for silence. “No civilized man has 
settled upon this planet. We are 
the first and therefore the place is 
ours. But there are perils, my 
friends! Who knows what strange 
monsters the jungle hides?” 

“Nothing larger than a chip- 
munk,” Danton muttered to him- 
self. “Why don’t they ask me? I’d 
tell them.” 

“Who knows what leviathan 
swims in the deep?” Simeon con- 
tinued. “We do know one thing: 
There is an aboriginal people 
here, naked and savage, undoubt- 
edly cunning, ruthless and amoral, 
as aboriginals always are. Of 
these we must beware. We will 
live in peace with them, if they 
will let us. We will bring to them 
the fruits of civilization and the 
flowers of culture. They may pro- 
fess friendship, but always remem- 



ber this, friends: No one can tell 
what goes on in a savage heart. 
Their standards are not ours; 
their morals are not ours. We can- 
not trust them; we must be for- 
ever on guard. And if in doubt, 
we must shoot first! Remember 
Lan II!” 



VERYBODY applauded, sang 
^ a hymn and began their eve- 
ning meal. As night fell, search- 
lights came on from the ship, 
making the beach bright as day. 
The sentries paced up and down, 
shoulders hunched nervously, 
rifles ready. 

Danton watched the settlers 
shake out their sleeping bags and 
retire under the bulge of the ship. 
Even their fear of sudden attack 
couldn’t force them to spend an- 
other night inside the ship, when 
there was fresh air to breathe 
outside. 

The great orange moon of New 
Tahiti was half-hidden by high- 
flying night clouds. The sentries 
paced and swore, and moved 
closer together for mutual com- 
fort and protection. They began 
firing at the jungle sounds and 
blasting at shadows. 

Danton crept back into the jun- 
gle. He retired for the night be- 
hind a tree, where he would be 
safe from stray bullets. This eve- 
ning had not seemed the time for 
straightening things out. The Hut- 
ters were too jumpy. It would be 



14

better, he decided, to handle the 
matter by daylight, in a simple, 
straightforward, reasonable fash- 
ion. 

The trouble was, the Hutters 
hardly seemed reasonable. 

In the morning, though, every- 
thing looked more promising. 
Danton waited until the Hutters 
had finished their breakfast, then 
strolled into view at the edge of 
the beach. 

“Halt!” every one of the sen- 
tries barked. 

“That savage is back!” called a 
settler. 

“Mummy,” cried a little boy, 

“don’t let the nasty bad man eat 

__ _ |» 

me! 

“Don’t worry, dear,” the boy’s 
mother said. “Your father has a 
rifle for shooting savages.” 

Simeon rushed out of the space- 
ship and glared at Danton. “All 
right, you! Come forward!” 

Danton stepped gingerly across 
the beach, his skin tingling with 
nervous expectation. He walked 
to Simeon, keeping his empty 
hands in sight. 

“I am the leader of these peo- 
ple,” Simeon said, speaking very 
slowly, as if to a child. “I the big 
chief fella. You big fella chief 
your people?” 

“There’s no need to talk that 
way,” Danton said. “I can hardly 
understand you. I told you yes- 
terday that I haven’t any people. 
There’s just me.” 

THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



S IMEON’S hard face grew 
white with anger. “Unless 
you’re honest with me, you’re go- 
ing to regret it. Now — where is 
your tribe?” 

“I’m an Earthman,” Danton 
yelled. “Are you deaf? Can’t you 
hear how I talk?” 

A stooped little man with white 
hair and great horn-rimmed 
glasses came over with Jedekiah. 
“Simeon,” the little man said, “I 
don’t believe I have met our 
guest.” 

“Professor Baker,” said Simeon, 
“this savage here claims he’s an 
Earthman and he says his name 
is Edward Danton.” 

The professor glanced at Dan- 
ton’s pareu, his tanned skin and 
calloused feet. “You are an Earth- 
man?” he asked Danton. 

“Of course.” 

“Who carved those stone stat- 
ues up the beach?” 

“I did,” Danton said, “but it 
was just therapy. You see — ” 
“Obviously primitive work. 
That stylization, those noses — ” 
“It was accidental, then. Look, 
a few months ago I left Earth in 
a spaceship—” 

“How was it powered?” Pro- 
fessor Baker asked. 

“By a GM subspatial torque 
converter.” Baker nodded, and 
Danton went on. “Well, I wasn’t 
interested in places like Korani 
or Heil V, and Hedonia seemed 
too rich for my blood. I passed 

15 



up the Mining Worlds and the 
Farming Worlds, and had the 
government ship drop me here. 
The planet’s registered as New 
Tahiti, in my name. But I was 
getting pretty lonely, so I’m glad 
you folks came.” 

“Well, Professor?” Simeon said. 
“What do you think?” 

“Amazing,” Baker murmured, 
“truly amazing. His grasp of col- 
loquial English bespeaks a fairly 
high level of intelligence, which 
points up a phenomenon fre- 
quently met with in savage socie- 
ties, namely, an unusually well- 
developed power of mimicry. Our 
friend Danta (as his original, un- 
corrupted name must have been) 
will probably be able to tell us 
many tribal legends, myths, songs, 
dances — ” 

“But I’m an Earthman!” 

“No, my poor friend,” the Pro- 
fessor corrected gently, “you are 
not. Obviously you have met an 
Earthman. Some trader, I dare- 
say, stopping for repairs.” 

Jedekiah said, “There’s evi- 
dence that a spaceship once 
landed here briefly.” 

“Ah,” said Professor Baker, 
beaming. “Confirmation of my 
hypothesis.” 

“That was the government 
ship,” Danton explained. “It 
dropped me off here.” 

“It is interesting to note,” said 
Professor Baker in his lecturing 
voice, “how his almost-plausible 



story lapses into myth at various 
crucial points. He claims that the 
ship was powered by a ‘GM sub- 
spatial torque converter’ — which 
is nonsense syllabification, since 
the only deep-space drive is the 
Mikkelsen. He claims that the 
journey from Earth was made in 
a matter of months (since his un- 
tutored mind cannot conceive of 
a journey lasting years), although 
we know that no space drive, 
even theoretically, can achieve 
that.” 

T WAS probably developed 
after you people left Earth,” 
Danton said. “How long have you 
been gone?” 

“The Hutter spaceship left 
Earth one hundred and twenty 
years ago,” Baker replied con- 
descendingly. “We are mostly 
fourth and fifth generation. Note 
also,” Baker said to Simeon and 
Jedekiah, “his attempt to think 
up plausible place-names. Words 
such as Korani, Heil, Hedonia 
appeal to his sense of onomato- 
poeia. That there are no such 
places doesn’t disturb him.” 
“There are!” Danton said in- 
dignantly. 

“Where?” Jedekiah challenged. 
“Give me the coordinates.” 

“How should I know? I’m no 
navigator. I think Heil was near 
Bootes, or maybe it was Cassio- 
peia. No, I’m pretty sure it was 
Bootes — ”

“I’m sorry, friend,” said Jede- 
kiah. “It may interest you to 
know that I’m the ship’s naviga- 
tor. I can show you the star at- 
lases and charts. Those places 
aren’t on them.” 

“Your charts are a hundred 
years out of date!” 

“Then so are the stars,” Simeon 
said. “Now, Danta, where is your 
tribe? Why do they hide from 
us? What are they planning?” 
“This is preposterous,” Danton 
protested. “What can I do to con- 
vince you? I’m an Earthman. I 
was born and raised — ” 

“That’s enough,” Simeon cut 
in. “If there’s one thing we flut- 
ters won’t stand for, it’s backtalk 
from natives. Out with it, Danta. 
Where are your people?” 

“There’s only me,” Danton in- 
sisted. 

“Tight-mouthed?” Jedekiah 
gritted. “Maybe a taste of the 
blacksnake whip—” 

“Later, later,” Simeon said. “His 
tribe’ll come around for handouts. 
Natives always do. In the mean- 
time, Danta, you can join that 
work gang over there, unloading 
the supplies.” 

“No, thanks,” said Danton. “I’m 
going back to—” 

Jedekiah’s fist lashed out, 
catching Danton on the side of 
the jaw. He staggered, barely 
keeping his footing. 

“The chief said no backtalk!” 
Jedekiah roared. “Why are you 

THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



natives always so bone-lazy? 
You’ll be paid as soon as we un- 
load the beads and calico. Now 
get to work.” 

That seemed to be the last 
word on the subject. Dazed and 
unsure, much like millions of na- 
tives before him on a thousand 
different worlds, Danton joined 
the long line of colonists passing 
goods out of the ship. 

DY LATE afternoon, the un- 
loading was done and the set- 
tlers were relaxed on the beach. 
Danton sat apart from them, try- 
ing to think his situation through. 
He was deep in thought when 
Anita came to him with a can- 
teen of water. 

“Do you think I’m a native?” 
he asked. 

She sat down beside him and 
said, “I really don’t see what else 
you could be. Everyone knows 
how fast a ship can travel and — ” 

“Times have changed since 
ycur people left Earth. They 
weren’t in space all that time, 
were they?” 

“Of course not. The Hutter 
ship went to H’gastro I, but it 
wasn’t fertile enough, so the next 
generation moved to Ktedi. But 
the corn mutated and almost 
wiped them out, so they went to 
Lan II. They thought that would 
be a permanent home.” 

“What happened?” 

“The natives,” said Anita sadly. 

17 



“I guess they were friendly 
enough, at first, and everyone 
thought the situation was well in 
hand. Then, one day, we were at 
war with the entire native popu- 
lation. They only had spears and 
things, but there were too many 
of them, so the ship left again 
and we came here.” 

“Hmm,” Danton said. “I see 
why you’re so nervous about 
aboriginals.” 

“Well, of course. While there’s 
any possibility of danger, we’re 
under military rule. That means 
my father and Jedekiah. But as 
soon as the emergency is past, 
our regular Hutter government 
takes over.” 

“Who runs that?” 

“A council of Elders,” Anita 
said, “men of good-will, who de- 
test violence. If you and your 
people are really peaceable — ” 
“I haven’t any people,” Dan- 
ton said wearily. 

“ — then you’ll have every op- 
portunity to prosper under the 
rule of the Elders,” she finished. 

They sat together and watched 
the sunset. Danton noticed how 
the wind stirred her hair, blowing 
it silkily across her forehead, and 
how the afterglow of the sun 
outlined and illuminated the line 
of her cheek and lip. He shivered 
and told himself it was the sud- 
den chill of evening. And Anita, 
who had been talking animatedly 
about her childhood, found diffi-

culty in completing her sentences, 
or even keeping her train of 
thought. 

After a while, their hands 
strayed together. Their fingertips 
touched and clung. For a long 
time, they said nothing at all. 
And at last, gently and linger- 
ingly, they kissed. 

“What the hell is going on 
here?” a loud voice demanded. 

"Tk ANTON looked up and saw 
a burly man standing over 
him, his powerful head silhouetted 
black against the moon, his fists 
on his hips. 

“Please, Jedekiah,” Anita said. 
“Don’t make a scene.” 

“Get up,” Jedekiah ordered 
Danton, in an ominously quiet 
voice. “Get up on your feet.” 

Danton stood up, his hands 
half-clenched into fists, waiting. 

“You,” Jedekiah said to Anita, 
“are a disgrace to your race and 
to the whole Hutter people. Are 
you crazy? You can’t mess 
around with a dirty native and 
still keep any self-respect.” He 
turned to Danton. “And you 
gotta learn something and learn 
it good. Natives don’t tool with 
Hutter women! I’m going to im- 
press that little lesson on you 
right here and now.” 

There was a brief scuffle and 
Jedekiah found himself sprawled 
on his back. 

“ Hurry !” Jedekiah shouted. 
20 



“The natives are revolting!” 

An alarm bell from the space- 
ship began to peal. Sirens wailed 
in the night. The women and 
children, long trained for such 
an emergency, trooped back into 
the spaceship. The men were is- 
sued rifles, machine guns and 
hand grenades, and began to ad- 
vance on Danton. 

“It’s just man to man,” Danton 
called out. “We had a disagree- 
ment, that’s all. There’s no na- 
tives or anything. Just me.” 

The foremost Hutter com- 
manded, “Anita, quick, get back!” 
“I didn’t see any natives,” the 
girl said staunchly. “And it wasn’t 
really Danta’s fault — ” 

“Get back!” 

She was pulled out of the way. 
Danton dived into the bushes 
before the machine guns opened 
up. 

He crawled on all fours for 
fifty yards, then broke into a 
dead run. 

Fortunately, the Hutters were 
not pursuing. They were inter- 
ested only in guarding their ship 
and holding their beachhead and 
a narrow stretch of jungle. Dan- 
ton heard gunfire throughout the 
night and loud shouts and fran- 
tic cries. 

“There goes one!” 

“Quick, turn the machine gun! 
They’re behind us!” 

“There! There! I got one!” 
“No, he got away! There he 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



goes . But look, up in the 
tree!” 

“Fire, man, fire!” 

A LL NIGHT, Danton listened 
as the Hutters repulsed the at- 
tacks of imaginary savages. 

Toward dawn, the firing sub- 
sided. Danton estimated that a 
ton of lead had been expended, 
hundreds of trees decapitated, 
acres of grass trampled into mud. 
The jungle stank of cordite. 

He fell into a fitful slumber. 

At midday, he awakened and 
heard someone moving through 
the underbrush. He retreated 
into the jungle and made a meal 
for himself out of a local variety 
of bananas and mangoes. Then 
he decided to think things over. 

But no thoughts came. His 
mind was filled with Anita and 
with grief over her loss. 

All that day, he wandered dis- 
consolately through the jungle, 
and in the late afternoon heard 
again the sound of someone mov- 
ing through the underbrush. 

He turned to go deeper into the 
island. Then he heard someone 
calling his name. 

“Danta! Danta! Wait!” 

It was Anita. Danton hesitated, 
not sure what to do. She might 
have decided to leave her people, 
to live in the green jungle with 
him. But more realistically, she 
might have been sent out as a 
decoy, leading a party of men to 

THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



destroy him. How could he know 
where her loyalties lay? 

“Danta! Where are you?” 

Danton reminded himself that 
there could never be anything be- 
tween them. Her people had 
shown what they thought of na- 
tives. They would always distrust 
him, forever try to kill him . 

“Please, Danta!” 

Danton shrugged his shoulders 
and walked toward her voice. 

They met in a little clearing. 
Anita’s hair was disheveled and 
her khakis were torn by the jun- 
gle briars, but for Danton there 
could never be a lovelier woman. 
For an instant, he believed that 
she had come to join him, flee 
with him. 

Then he saw armed men fifty 
yards behind her. 

“It’s all right,” Anita said. 
“They’re not going to kill you. 
They just came along to guard 
me.” 

“Guard you? From me?” Dan- 
ton laughed hollowly. 

“They don’t know you as I do,” 
Anita said. “At the Council meet- 
ing today, I told them the truth.” 

“You did?” 

“Of course. That fight wasn’t 
your fault and I told everybody 
so. I told them you fought only to 
defend yourself. And Jedekiah 
lied. No pack of natives attacked 
him. There was only you, and I 
told them this.” 

“Good girl,” Danton said fer- 

21 



vently. “Did they believe you?” 

“I think so. I explained that 
the native attack came later.” 

T^ANTON groaned. “Look, how 
could there be a native attack 
when there aren’t any natives?” 
“But there are,” Anita said. “I 
heard them shouting.” 

“Those were your own people.” 
Danton tried to think of some- 
thing that would convince her. If 
he couldn’t convince this one girl, 
how could he possibly convince 
the rest of the Hutters? 

And then he had it. It was a 
very simple proof, but its effect 
would have to be overwhelming. 

“You actually believe there was 
a full-scale native attack,” Dan- 
ton stated. 

“Of course.” 

“How many natives?” 

“I heard you outnumbered us 
by at least ten to one.” 

“And we were armed?” 

“You certainly were.” 

“Then how,” Danton asked tri- 
umphantly, “do you account for 
the fact that not a single Hutter 
was wounded!” 

She stared at him wide-eyed. 
“But, Danta dear, many of the 
Hutters were wounded, some seri- 
ously. It’s a wonder no one was 
killed in all that fighting!” 
Danton felt as though the 
ground had been kicked out from 
under him. For a terrifying min- 
ute, he believed her. The Hutters 

22 



were so certain! Perhaps he did 
have a tribe, after all, hundreds 
of bronzed savages like himself, 
hidden in the jungle, waiting . 

“That trader who taught you 
English,” Anita said, “must have 
been a very unscrupulous charac- 
ter. It’s against interstellar law, 
you know, to sell firearms to 
natives. Someday he’ll be caught 
and 

“Firearms?” 

“Certainly. You couldn’t use 
them very accurately, of course. 
But Simeon said that sheer fire- 
power — ” 

“I suppose all your casualties 
were from gunshot wounds.” 

“Yes. The men didn’t let you get 
close enough to use knives and 
spears.” 

“I see,” Danton said. His proof 
was utterly demolished. But he 
felt enormously relieved at hav- 
ing regained his sanity. The dis- 
organized Hutter soldiery had 
ranged around the jungle, firing 
at everything that moved — each 
other. Of course they had gotten 
into trouble. It was more than a 
wonder that some of them hadn’t 
been killed. It was a miracle. 

“But I explained that they 
couldn’t blame you,” said Anita. 
“You were attacked first and your 
own people must have thought 
you were in danger. The Elders 
thought this was probable.” 

“Nice of them,” Danton said. 

“They want to be reasonable. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



After all, they realize that natives 
are human beings just like our- 
selves.” 

W A RE you sure of that?” 
Danton asked, with feeble 

irony. 

“Of course. So the Elders held 
a big meeting on native policy 
and decided it once and for all. 
We’re setting aside a thousand 
acres as a reservation for you and 
your people. That should be 
plenty of room, shouldn’t it? The 
men are putting up the boundary 
posts now. You’ll live peacefully 
in your reservation and we’ll live 
in our own part of the island.” 

“What?” Danton said. 

“And to seal the pledge,” Anita 
continued, “the Elders asked you 
to accept this.” She handed him 
a roll of parchment. 

“What is it?” 

“It’s a peace treaty, declaring 
the end of the Sutter-New Tahi- 
tian war, and pledging our respec- 
tive peoples to eternal amity.” 

Numbly, Danton accepted the 
parchment. He saw that the men 
who had accompanied Anita were 
setting red and black striped 
posts into the ground. They sang 
as they worked, happy to have 
reached a solution for the native 
problem so quickly and easily. 

“But don’t you think,” Danton 
asked, “that perhaps — ah — 
assimilation might be a better 
solution?” 

THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



“I suggested it,” Anita said, 
blushing. 

“You did? You mean that you 
would — ” 

“Of course I would,” said Anita, 
not looking at him. “I think the 
amalgamation of two strong races 
would be a fine and wonderful 
thing. And, Danta, what wonder- 
ful stories and legends you could 
have told the children!” 

“I could have showed them 
how to fish and hunt,” Danton 
said, “and which plants are edi- 
ble, and things like that.” 

“And all your colorful tribal 
songs and dances.” Anita sighed. 
“It would have been wonderful. 
I’m sorry, Danta.” 

“But something must be pos- 
sible! Can’t I talk to the Elders? 
Isn’t there anything I can do?” 
“Nothing,” Anita said. “I’d run 
away with you, Danta, but they’d 
track us down, no matter how 
long it took.” 

“They’d never find us,” Danton 
promised. 

“Perhaps. I’d be willing to take 
the chance.” 

“Darling!” 

“But I can’t. Your poor people, 
Danta! The Hutters would take 
hostages, kill them if I weren’t 
returned.” 

“I don’t have any people! I 
don’t, damn it!” 

“It’s sweet of you to say that,” 
Anita said tenderly. “But lives 
cannot be sacrificed just for the 

23 



love of two individuals. You must 
tell your people not to cross the 
boundary lines, Danta. They’ll 
be shot. Good-by, and remember, 
it is best to live in the path of 
peace.” 

She hurried away from him. 
Danton watched her go, angry at 
her noble sentiments which sepa- 
rated them for no reason at all, 
yet loving her for the love she 
showed his people. That his 
people were imaginary didn’t 
count. It was the thought that 
mattered. 

At last he turned and walked 
deep into the jungle. 

XJ E stopped by a still pi >1 of 
black water, overhung with 
giant trees and bordered by 
flowering ferns, and here he tried 
to plan the rest of his life. Anita 
was gone; all commerce with 
human beings was gone. He didn’t 
need any of them, he told him- 
self. He had his reservation. He 
could replant his vegetable gar- 
den, carve more statues, compose 
more sonatas, start another 
journal . 

“To hell with that!” he shouted 
to the trees. He didn’t want to 
sublimate any longer. He wanted 
Anita and he wanted to live with 
humans. He was tired of being 
alone. 

What could he do about it? 

There didn’t seem to be any- 
thing. He leaned back against a 

24 



tree and stared at New Tahiti’s 
impossibly blue sky. If only the 
Hutters weren’t so superstitious, 
so afraid of natives, so . 

And then it came to him, a 
plan so absurd, so dangerous . 

“It’s worth a try,” Danton said 
to himself, “even if they kill me.” 

He trotted off toward the 
Hutter boundary line. 

A sentry saw him as he neared 
the vicinity of the spaceship and 
leveled his rifle. Danton raised 
both arms. 

“Don’t fire! I have to speak 
with your leaders!” 

“Get back on your reservation,” 
the sentry warned. “Get back or 
I’ll shoot.” 

“I have to speak to Simeon,” 
Danton stated, holding his 
ground. 

“Orders is orders,” said the 
sentry, taking aim. 

“Just a minute.” Simeon 
stepped out of the ship, frowning 
deeply. “What is all this?” 

“That native came back,” the 
sentry said. “Shall I pop him, 
sir?” 

“What do you want?” Simeon 
asked Danton. 

“I have come here to bring 
you,” Danton roared, “a declara- 
tion of war!” 

HP HAT woke up the Hutter 
camp. In a few minutes, every 
man, woman and child had gath- 
ered near the spaceship. The 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Elders, a council of old men 
distinguished by their long white 
beards, were standing to one side. 

“You accepted the peace 
treaty,” Simeon pointed out. 

“I had a talk with the other 
chiefs of the island,” Danton said, 
stepping forward. “We feel the 
treaty is not fair. New Tahiti is 
ours. It belonged to our fathers 
and to our fathers’ fathers. Here 
we have raised our children, 
sown our corn and reaped the 
breadfruit. We will not live on 
the reservation!” 

“Oh, Danta!” Anita cried, ap- 
pearing from the spaceship. “I 
asked you to bring peace to your 
people!” 

“They wouldn't listen,” Danton 
said. “All the tribes are gather- 
ing. Not only my own people, the 
Cynochi, but the Drovati, the 
Lorognasti, the Retellsmbroichi 
and the Vitelli. Plus, naturally, 
their sub-tribes and dependen- 
cies.” 

“How many are you?” Simeon 
asked. 

“Fifty or sixty thousand. Of 
course, we don’t all have rifles. 
Most of us will have to rely on 
more primitive weapons, such as 
poisoned arrows and darts.” 

A nervous murmur arose from 
the crowd. 

“Many of us will be killed,” 
Danton said stonily. “We do not 
care. Every New Tahitian will 
fight like a lion. We are a thou- 



sand to your one. We have 
cousins on the other islands who 
will join us. No matter what the 
cost in human life and misery, 
we will drive you into the sea. I 
have spoken.” 

He turned and started back 
into the jungle, walking with stiff 
dignity. 

“Shall I pop him now, sir?” 
the sentry begged. 

“Put down that rifle, you fool!” 
Simeon snapped. “Wait, Danta! 
Surely we can come to terms. 
Bloodshed is senseless.” 

“I agree,” Danton said soberly. 

“What do you want?” 

“Equal rights!” 

The Elders went into an im- 
mediate conference. Simeon 
listened to them, then turned to 
Danton. 

“That may be possible. Is there 
anything else?” 

“Nothing,” Danton said. “Ex- 
cept, naturally, an alliance be- 
tween the ruling clan of the 
Hutters and the ruling clan of 
the New Tahitians, to seal the 
bargain. Marriage would be best.” 

A FTER going into conference 
again, the Elders gave their 
instructions to Simeon. The mili- 
tary chief was obviously dis- 
turbed. The cords stood out on his 
neck, but with an effort he con- 
trolled himself, bowed his agree- 
ment to the Elders and marched 
up to Danton. 



THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



25 



“The Elders have authorized 
me,” he said, “to offer you an 
alliance of blood brotherhood. 
You and I, representing the lead- 
ing clans of our peoples, will 
mingle our blood together in a 
beautiful and highly symbolic 
ceremony, then break bread, take 
salt - ” 

“Sorry,” Danton said. “We 
New Tahitians don’t hold with 
that sort of thing. It has to be 
marriage.” 

“But damn it all, man — ” 
“That is my last word.” 

“We’ll never accept! Never!” 
“Then it’s war,” Danton de- 
clared and walked into the jungle. 

He was in a mood for making 
war. But how, he asked himself, 
does a single native fight against 
a spaceship full of armed men? 

He was brooding on this when 
Simeon and Anita came to him 
through the jungle. 

“All right,” Simeon said angrily. 
“The Elders have decided. We 
Hutters are sick of running from 
planet to planet. We’ve had this 
problem before and I suppose 
we’d just go somewhere else and 
have it again. We’re sick and tired 
of the whole native problem, so 
I guess — ” he gulped hard, but 
manfully finished the sentence — 
“we’d better assimilate. At least, 
that’s what the Elders think. Per- 
sonally, I’d rather fight.” 

“You’d lose,” Danton assured 
him, and at that moment he felt 




26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




he could take on the Hutters 
single-handed and win. 

“Maybe so,” Simeon admitted. 
“Anyhow, you can thank Anita 
for making the peace possible.” 

“Anita? Why?” 

“Why, man, she’s the only girl 
in the camp who’d marry a 
naked, dirty, heathen savage!” 

A ND so they were married, and 
Danta, now known as the 
White Man’s Friend, settled down 
to help the Hutters conquer their 
new land. They, in turn, intro- 
duced him to the marvels of 
civilization. He was taught 
Twelve-hand Bridge and Mass 
Dancing. And soon the Hutters 
built their first Subway — for a 
civilized people must release their 



THE NATIVE PROBLEM 



27 



aggressions — and that game was 
shown to Danta, too. 

He tried to master the spirit 
of the classic Earth pastime, but 
it was obviously beyond the com- 
prehension of his savage soul. 
Civilization stifled him, so Danta 
and his wife moved across the 
planet, always following the fron- 
tier, staying far from the ameni- 
ties of civilization. 

Anthropologists frequently 
came to visit him. They recorded 
all the stories he told his children, 
the ancient and beautiful legends 
of New Tahiti — tales of sky gods 
and water demons, fire sprites 
and woodland nymphs, and how 
Katamandura was ordered to 
create the world out of nothing- 
ness in just three days, and what 
his reward for this was, and what 
Jevasi said to Hootmenlati when 
they met in the underworld, and 
the strange outcome of this meet- 
ing. 

The anthropologists noted simi- 
larities between these legends and 
certain legends of Earth, and 
several interesting theories were 
put forth. And they were inter- 
ested in the great sandstone 
statues on the main island of New 



Tahiti, weird and haunting works 
which no viewer could forget, 
clearly the work of a pre-New 
Tahitian race, of whom no trace 
could ever be found. 

But most fascinating of all for 
the scientific workers was the 
problem of the New Tahitians 
themselves. Those happy, laugh- 
ing, bronzed savages, bigger, 
stronger, handsomer and healthier 
than any other race, had melted 
away at the coming of the white 
man. Only a few of the older 
Hutters could remember having 
met them in any numbers and 
their tales were considered none 
too reliable. 

“My people?” Danta would 
say, when questioned. “Ah, they 
could not stand the white man’s 
diseases, the white man’s mechan- 
ical civilization, the white man’s 
harsh and repressive ways. They 
are in a happier place now, in 
Valhoola beyond the sky. And 
someday I shall go there, too.” 

And white men, hearing this, 
experienced strangely guilty feel- 
ings and redoubled their efforts 
to show kindness to Danta, the 
Last Native.

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



I T WAS a good job and Max 
Alben knew whom he had to 
thank for it— his great-grand- 
father. 

“Good old Giovanni Albeni,” 
he muttered as he hurried into 
the laboratory slightly ahead of 
the escorting technicians, all of 
them, despite the excitement of 
the moment, remembering to bob 
their heads deferentially at the 

OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS 



half-dozen full-fleshed and hard- 
faced men lolling on the couches 
that had been set up around the 
time machine. 

He shrugged rapidly out of his 
rags, as he had been instructed in 
the anteroom, and stepped into 
the housing of the enormous 
mechanism. This was the first 
time he had seen it, since he had 
been taught how to operate it on 

29 



a dummy model, and now he 
stared at the great transparent 
coils and the susurrating energy 
bubble with much respect. 

This machine, the pride and 
the hope of 2089, was something 
almost outside his powers of com- 
prehension. But Max Alben knew 
how to run it, and he knew, 
roughly, what it was supposed to 
accomplish. He knew also that 
this was the first backward jour- 
ney of any great duration and, be- 
ing scientifically unpredictable, 
might well be the death of him. 

“Good old Giovanni Albeni,” he 
muttered again affectionately. 

If his great-grandfather had not 
volunteered for the earliest time- 
travel experiments way back in 
the nineteen-seventies, back even 
before the Blight, it would never 
have been discovered that he and 
his seed possessed a great deal of 
immunity to extra-temporal black- 
out. 

And if that had not been dis- 
covered, the ruling powers of 
Earth, more than a century later, 
would never have plucked Max 
Alben out of an obscure civil- 
service job as a relief guard at the 
North American Chicken Reser- 
vation to his present heroic and 
remunerative eminence. He would 
still be patrolling the barbed wire 
that surrounded the three white 
leghorn hens and two roosters — 
about one-sixth of the known live- 
stock wealth of the Western Hem- 

30 



isphere — thoroughly content with 
the half-pail of dried apricots he 
received each and every payday. 

No, if his great-grandfather had 
not demonstrated long ago his 
unique capacity for remaining 
conscious during time travel, Max 
Alben would not now be shifting 
from foot to foot in a physics lab- 
oratory, facing the black market 
kings of the world and awaiting 
their final instructions with an 
uncertain and submissive grin. 

1VTEN like O’Hara, who con- 
•J-” trolled mushrooms, Levney, 
the blackberry tycoon, Sorgasso, 
the packaged-worm monopolist — 
would black marketeers of their 
tremendous stature so much as 
waste a glance on someone like 
Alben ordinarily, let alone confer 
a lifetime pension on his wife and 
five children of a full spoonful 
each of non-synthetic sugar a 
day? 

Even if he didn’t come back, 
his family was provided for like 
almost no other family on Earth. 
This was a damn good job and 
he was lucky. 

Alben noticed that Abd Sadha 
had risen from the straight chair 
at the far side of the room and 
was approaching him with a 
sealed metal cylinder in one hand. 

“We’ve decided to add a fur- 
ther precaution at the last mo- 
ment,” the old man said. “That is, 
the scientists have suggested it 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and I have — er — I have given my 
approval.” 

The last remark was added 
with a slight questioning note as 
the Secretary - General of the 
United Nations looked back rap- 
idly at the black market princes 
on the couches behind him. Since 
they stared back stonily, but of- 
fered no objection, he coughed in 
relief and returned to Alben. 

“I am sure, young man, that I 
don’t have to go into the details 
of your instructions once more. 
You enter the time machine and 
go back the duration for which it 
has been preset, a hundred and 
thirteen years, to the moment 
after the Guided Missile of 1976 
was launched. It is 1976, isn’t it?” 
he asked, suddenly uncertain. 

“Yes, sir,” one of the techni- 
cians standing by the time ma- 
chine said respectfully. “The ex- 
periment with an atomic warhead 
guided missile that resulted in the 
Blight was conducted on this site 
on April 18, 1976.” He glanced 
proudly at the unemotional men 
on the couches, very much like a 
small boy after completing a reci- 
tation before visiting dignitaries 
from the Board of Education. 

“Just so.” Abd Sadha nodded. 
“April 18, 1976. And on this site. 
You see, young man, you will 
materialize at the very moment 
and on the very spot where the 
remote-control station handling 
the missile was — er — handling 



the missile. You will be in a su- 
perb position, a superb position, 
to deflect the missile in its down- 
ward course and alter human his- 
tory for the better. Very much 
for the better. Yes.” 

He paused, having evidently 
stumbled out of his thought se- 
quence. 

“And he pulls the red switch 
toward him,” Gomez, the dande- 
lion-root magnate, reminded him 
sharply, impatiently. 

“Ah, yes, the red switch. He 
pulls the little red switch toward 
him. Thank you, Mr. Gomez, 
thank you very much, sir. He 
pulls the little red switch on the 
green instrument panel' toward 
him, thus preventing the error 
that caused the missile to explode 
in the Brazilian jungle and caus- 
ing it, instead, to explode some- 
where in the mid-Pacific, as orig- 
inally planned.” 

The Secretary-General of the 
United Nations beamed. “Thus 
preventing the Blight, making it 
nonexistent, as it were, producing 
a present-day world in which the 
Blight never occurred. That is 
correct, is it not, gentlemen?” he 
asked, turning anxiously again. 

TVTONE of the half-dozen men 

’ on couches deigned to answer 
him. And Alben kept his eyes def- 
erentially in their direction, too, 
as he had throughout this period 
of last-minute instruction. 



OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS 



31 



He knew who ruled his world — 
these stolid, well-fed men in clean 
garments with a minimum of 
patches, and where patches oc- 
curred, at least they were the 
color of the surrounding cloth. 

Sadha might be Secretary-Gen- 
eral of the United Nations, but 
that was still a civil-service job, 
only a few social notches higher 
than a chicken guard. His clothes 
were fully as ragged, fully as 
multi-colored, as those that Alben 
had stepped out of. And the 
gnawing in his stomach was no 
doubt almost as great. 

“You understand, do you not, 
young man, that if anything goes 
wrong,” Abd Sadha asked, his 
head nodding tremulously and 
anticipating the answer, “if any- 
thing unexpected, unprepared-for, 
occurs, you are not to continue 
with the experiment but return 
immediately?” 

“He understands everything he 
has to understand,” Gomez told 
him. “Let’s get this thing moving.” 

The old man smiled again. 
“Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.” He 
came up to where Alben stood in 
the entrance of the time machine 
and handed the sealed metal cyl- 
inder to him. “This is the precau- 
tion the scientists have just added. 
When you arrive at your destina- 
tion, just before materializing, 
you will release it into the sur- 
rounding temporal medium. Our 
purpose here, as you no doubt — ” 

32 



Levney sat up on his couch and 
snapped his fingers peremptorily. 
“I just heard Gomez tell you to 
get this thing moving, Sadha. And 
it isn’t moving. We’re busy men. 
We’ve wasted enough time.” 

“I was just trying to explain a 
crucial final fact,” the Secretary- 
General apologized. “A fact which 
may be highly—” 

“You’ve explained enough 
facts.” Levney turned to the man 
inside the time machine. “Hey, 
fella. You. Move!” 

Max Alben gulped and nodded 
violently. He darted to the rear of 
the machine and turned the dial 
which activated it. 

flick! 

¥T WAS a good job and Mac 
Albin knew whom he had to 
thank for it — his great-grand- 
father. 

“Good old Giovanni Albeni,” he 
laughed as he looked at the mo- 
rose faces of his two colleagues. 
Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had 
done as much as he to build the 
tiny time machine in the secret 
lab under the helicopter garage, 
and they were fully as eager to 
go, but— unfortunately for them — 
they were not descended from the 
right ancestor. 

Leisurely, he unzipped the 
richly embroidered garment that, 
as the father of two children, he 
was privileged to wear, and wrig- 
gled into the housing of the com- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS 



33 



plex little mechanism. This was 
hardly the first time he had seen 
it, since he’d been helping to 
build the device from the moment 
Honek had nodded and risen from 
the drafting board, and now he 
barely wasted a glance on the 
thumb-size translucent coils grow- 
ing out of the almost microscopic 
energy bubbles which powered 
them. 

This machine was the last hope, 
of 2089, even if the world of 
2089, as a whole, did not know 
of its existence and would try to 
prevent its being put into opera- 
tion. But it meant a lot more to 
Mac Albin than merely saving a 
world. It meant an adventurous 
mission with the risk of death. 

“Good old Giovanni Albeni,” 
he laughed again happily. 

If his great-grandfather had not 
volunteered for the earliest time- 
travel experiments way back in 
the nineteen-seventies, back even 
before the Epidemic, it would 
never have been discovered that 
he and his seed possessed a great 
deal of immunity to extra-tem- 
poral blackout. 

And if that had not been dis- 
covered, the Albins would not 
have become physicists upon the 
passage of the United Nations law 
that everyone on Earth — abso- 
lutely without exception — had to 
choose a branch of research sci- 
ence in which to specialize. In the 
flabby, careful, life-guarding world 



the Earth had become, Mac Al- 
bin would never have been reluc- 
tantly selected by his two co- 
workers as the one to carry the 
forbidden banner of dangerous 
experiment. 

No, if his great-grandfather had 
not demonstrated long ago his 
unique capacity for remaining 
conscious during time travel, Mac 
Albin would probably be a biolo- 
gist today like almost everyone 
else on Earth, laboriously working 
out dreary gene problems instead 
of embarking on the greatest ad- 
venture Man had known to date. 

Even if he didn’t come back, he 
had at last found a socially use- 
ful escape from genetic responsi- 
bility to humanity in general and 
his own family in particular. This 
was a damn good job and he was 
lucky. 

“Wait a minute, Mac,” Skeat 
said and crossed to the other side 
of the narrow laboratory. 

A LBIN and Honek watched 
him stuff several sheets of 
paper into a small metal box 
which he closed without locking. 

“You will take care of yourself, 
won’t you, Mac?” Hugo Honek 
pleaded. “Any time you feel like 
taking an unnecessary risk, re- 
member that Bob and I will have 
to stand trial if you don’t come 
back. We might be sentenced to 
complete loss of professional 
status and spend the rest of our 



34 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lives supervising robot factories.” 
“Oh, it won’t be that bad,” Al- 
bin reassured him absent-mind- 
edly from where he lay contorted 
inside the time machine. He 
watched Slceat coming toward 
him with the box. 

Honek shrugged his shoulders. 
“It might be a lot worse than 
even that and you know it. The 
disappearance of a two - time 
father is going to leave an awful 
big vacancy in the world. One- 
timers, like Bob and me, are all 
over the place; if either of us 
dropped out of sight, it wouldn’t 
cause nearly as much uproar.” 
“But Bob and you both tried 
to operate the machine,” Albin 
reminded him. “And you blacked 
out after a fifteen-second tempo- 
ral displacement. So I’m the only 
chance, the only way to stop the 
human race from dwindling and 
dwindling till it hits absolute zero, 
like that fat old Security Council 
seems willing for it to do.” 

“Take it easy, Mac,” Bob Skeat 
said as he handed the metal box to 
Albin. “The Security Council is 
just trying to solve the problem 
in their way, the conservative 
way: a worldwide concentration 
on genetics research coupled with 
the maximum preservation of ex- 
isting human lives, especially 
those that have a high reproduc- 
tive potential. We three disagree 
with them; we’ve been skulking 
down here nights to solve it our 

Of ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS 



way, and ours is a radical ap- 
proach and plenty risky. That’s 
the reason for the metal box — 
trying to cover one more explo- 
sive possibility.” 

Albin turned it around curi- 
ously. “How?” 

“I sat up all last night writing 
the manuscript that’s inside it. 
Look, Mac, when you go back to 
the Guided Missile Experiment of 
1976 and push that red switch 
away from you, a lot of other 
things are going to happen than 
just deflecting the missile so that 
it will explode in the Brazilian 
jungle instead of the Pacific 
Ocean.” 

“Sure. I know. If it explodes in 
the jungle, the Epidemic doesn’t 
occur. No Shapiro’s Mumps.” 
Skeat jiggled his pudgy little 
face impatiently. “That’s not 
what I mean. The Epidemic 
doesn’t occur, but something else 
does. A new world, a different 
2089, an alternate time sequence. 
It’ll be a world in which human- 
ity has a better chance to survive, 
but it’ll be one with problems of 
its own. Maybe tough problems. 
Maybe the problems will be 
tough enough so that they’ll get 
the same idea we did and try to 
go back to the same point in time 
to change them.” 

A LBIN laughed. “That’s just 
looking for trouble.” 

“Maybe it is, but that’s my job. 

35 



Hugo’s the designer of the time 
machine and you’re the operator, 
but I’m the theoretical man in 
this research team. It’s my job to 
look for trouble. So, just in case, 
I wrote a brief history of the 
world from the time the missile 
exploded in the Pacific. It tells 
why ours is the worst possible of 
futures. It’s in that box.” 

“What do I do with it — hand it 
to the guy from the alternate 
2089?” 

The small fat man exasperat- 
edly hit the side of the time ma- 
chine with a well-cushioned palm. 
“ Y ou know better. There won’t be 
any alternate 2089 until you push 
that red switch on the green in- 
strument panel. The moment you 
do, our world, with all its slow 
slide to extinction, goes out and 
its alternate goes on — just like 
two electric light bulbs on a push- 
pull circuit. We and every single 
one of our artifacts, including the 
time machine, disappear. The 
problem is how to keep that 
manuscript from disappearing. 

“Well, all you do, if I have this 
figured right, is shove the metal 
box containing the manuscript 
out into the surrounding temporal 
medium a moment before you 
materialize to do your job. That 
temporal medium in which you’ll 
be traveling is something that ex- 
ists independent of and autono- 
mous to all possible futures. It’s 
my hunch that something that’s 



immersed in it will not be altered 
by a new time sequence.” 

"DEMIND him to be careful, 
A*Bob,” Honek rumbled. “He 
thinks he’s Captain Blood and 
this is his big chance to run away 
to sea and become a swashbuck- 
ling pirate.” 

Albin grimaced in annoyance. 
“I am excited by doing something 
besides sitting in a safe little cor- 
ner working out safe little ab- 
stractions for the first time in my 
life. But I know that this is a first 
experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I 
really have enough intelligence to 
recognize that simple fact. I know 
that if anything unexpected pops 
up, anything we didn’t foresee, 
I’m supposed to come scuttling 
back and ask for advice.” 

“I hope you do,” Bob Skeat 
sighed. “I hope you do know that. 
A twentieth century poet once 
wrote something to the effect that 
the world will end not with a 
bang, but a whimper. Well, our 
world is ending with a whimper. 
Try to see that it doesn’t end with 
a bang, either.” 

“That I’ll promise you,” Albin 
said a trifle disgustedly. “It’ll end 
with neither a bang nor a whim- 
per. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.” 
He twisted around, reaching 
overhead for the lever which ac- 
tivated the forces that drove the 
time machine. 

flick!

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T T WAS strange, Max Alben re- 
fleeted, that this time travel 
business, which knocked uncon- 
scious everyone who tried it, only 
made him feel slightly dizzy. 
That was because he was de- 
scended from Giovanni Albeni, he 
had been told. There must be 
some complicated scientific ex- 
planation for it, he decided — and 
that would make it none of his 
business. Better forget about it. 

All around the time machine, 
there was a heavy gray murk in 
which objects were hinted at 
rather than stated definitely. It 
reminded him of patrolling his 
beat at the North American 
Chicken Reservation in a thick 
fog. 

According to his gauges, he was 
now in 1976. He cut speed until 
he hit the last day of April, then 
cut speed again, drifting slowly 
backward to the eighteenth, the 
day of the infamous Guided Mis- 
sile Experiment. Carefully, care- 
fully, like a man handling a 
strange bomb made on a strange 
planet, he watched the center 
gauge until the needle came to 
rest against the thin etched line 
that indicated the exactly crucial 
moment. Then he pulled the 
brake and stopped the machine 
dead. 

All he had to do now was ma- 
terialize in the right spot, flash 
out and pull the red switch to- 
ward him. Then his well-paid as- 



signment would be done. 

But . 

He stopped and scratched his 
dirt-matted hair. Wasn’t there 
something he was supposed to do 
a second before materialization? 
Yes, that useless old windbag, 
Sadha, had given him a last in- 
struction. 

He picked up the sealed metal 
cylinder, walked to the entrance 
of the time machine and tossed it 
into the gray murk. A solid object 
floating near the entrance caught 
his eye. He put his arm out — 
whew, it was cold! — and pulled it 
inside. 

A small metal box. Funny. 
What was it doing out there? Cu- 
riously, he opened it, hoping to 
find something valuable. Nothing 
but a few sheets of paper, Alben 
noted disappointedly. He began 
to read them slowly, very slowly, 
for the manuscript was full of a 
lot of long and complicated 
words, like a letter from one 
bookworm scientist to another. 

The problems all began with 
the Guided Missile Experiment of 
1976, he read. There had been a 
number of such experiments, but 
it was the one of 1976 that finally 
did the damage the biologists 
had been warning about. The mis- 
sile with its deadly warhead ex- 
ploded in the Pacific Ocean as 
planned, the physicists and the 
military men went home to study 
their notes, and the world shiv-

ered once more over the ap- 
proaching war and tried to forget 
about it. 

But there was fallout, a radio- 
active rain several hundred miles 
to the north, and a small fishing 
fleet got thoroughly soaked by it. 
Fortunately, the radioactivity in 
the rain was sufficiently low to do 
little obvious physical damage: 
All it did was cause a mutation in 
the mumps virus that several of 
the men in the fleet were incubat- 
ing at the time, having caught it 
from the children of the fishing 
town, among whom a minor epi- 
demic was raging. 

1 1 ’ HE fleet returned to its home 
town, which promptly came 
down with the new kind of 
mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, 
the only physician in town, was 
the first man to note that, while 
the symptoms of this disease were 
substantially milder than those of 
its unmutated parent, practically 
no one was immune to it and its 
effects on human reproductivity 
were truly terrible. Most people 
were completely sterilized by it. 
The rest were rendered much less 
capable of fathering or bearing 
offspring. 

Shapiro’s Mumps spread over 
the entire planet in the next few 
decades. It leaped across every 
quarantine erected; for a long 
time, it successfully defied all the 
vaccines and serums attempted 



against it. Then, when a vaccine 
was finally perfected, humanity 
discovered to its dismay that its 
generative powers had been per- 
manently and fundamentally im- 
paired. 

Something 'had happened to 
the germ plasm. A large percent- 
age of individuals were born ster- 
ile, and, of those who were not, 
one child was usually the most 
that could be expected, a two- 
child parent, being quite rare and 
a three-child parent almost un- 
known. 

Strict eugenic control was insti- 
tuted by the Security Council of 
the United Nations so that fertile 
men and women would not be 
wasted upon non-fertile mates. 
Fertility was the most important 
avenue to social status, and right 
after it came successful genetic 
research. 

Genetic research had the very 
best minds prodded into it; the 
lesser ones went into the other 
sciences. Everyone on Earth was 
engaged in some form of scientific 
research to some extent. Since the 
population was now so limited in 
proportion to the great resources 
available, all physical labor had 
long been done by robots. The 
government saw to it that every- 
body had an ample supply of 
goods and, in return, asked only 
that they experiment without any 
risk to their own lives — every hu- 
man being was now a much-

prized, highly guarded rarity. 

There were less than a hun- 
dred thousand of them, well be- 
low the danger point, it had been 
estimated, where a species might 
be wiped out by a new calamity. 
Not that another calamity would 
be needed. Since the end of the 
Epidemic, the birth rate had been 
moving further and further be- 
hind the death rate. In another 
century . 

That was why a desperate and 
secret attempt to alter the past 
was being made. This kind of 
world was evidently impossible. 

Max Alben finished the manu- 
script and sighed. What a won- 
derful world! What a comfortable 
place to live! 

He walked to the rear dials 
and began the process of materi- 
alizing at the crucial moment on 
April 18, 1976. 

flick! 

TT WAS odd, Mac Albin re- 
fleeted, that these temporal 
journeys, which induced coma in 
everyone who tried it, only made 
him feel slightly dizzy. That was 
because he was descended from 
Giovanni Albeni, he knew. Maybe 
there was some genetic relation- 
ship with his above-average fertil- 
ity — might be . a good idea to 
mention the idea to a biologist or 
two when he returned. If he re- 
turned. 

All around the time machine, 

OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS 



there was a soupy gray murk in 
which objects were hinted at 
rather than stated definitely. It 
reminded him of the problems of 
landing a helicopter in a thick fog 
when the robot butler had not 
been told to turn on the ground 
lights. 

According to the insulated reg- 
ister, he was now in 1976. He 
lowered speed until he registered 
April, then maneuvered slowly 
backward through time to the 
eighteenth, the day of the infa- 
mous Guided Missile Experiment. 
Carefully, carefully, like an ob- 
stetrician supervising surgical ro- 
bots at an unusually difficult 
birth, he watched the register un- 
til it rolled to rest against the 
notch that indicated the exactly 
crucial moment. Then he pushed 
a button and froze the machine 
where it was. 

All he had to do now was ma- 
terialize in the right spot, flash 
out and push the red switch, from 
him. Then his exciting adventure 
would be over. 

But . 

He paused and tapped at his 
sleek chin. He was supposed to do 
something a second before mate- 
rialization. Yes, that nervous the- 
oretician, Bob Skeat, had given 
him a last suggestion. 

He picked up the small metal 
box, twisted around to face the 
opening of the time machine and 
dropped it into the gray murk. A 

39 



solid object floating near the 
opening attracted his attention. 
He shot his arm out — it was cold, 
as cold as they had figured — and 
pulled the object inside. 

A sealed metal cylinder. 
Strange. What was it doing out 
there? Anxiously, he opened it, 
not daring to believe he’d find a 
document inside. Yes, that was 
exactly what it was, he saw ex- 
citedly. He began to read it rap- 
idly, very rapidly, as if it were a 
newly published paper on neu- 
trinos. Besides, the manuscript 
was written with almost painful 
simplicity, like a textbook com- 
posed by a stuffy pedagogue for 
the use of morons. 

The problems all began with 
the Guided Missile Experiment of 
1976, he read. There had been a 
number of such experiments, but 
it was the one of 1976 that finally 
did the damage the biologists 
had been warning about. The mis- 
sile with its deadly warhead ex- 
ploded in the Brazilian jungle 
through some absolutely unfor- 
givable error in the remote-con- 
trol station, the officer in charge 
of the station was reprimanded 
and the men under him court- 
martialed, and the Brazilian gov- 
ernment was paid a handsome 
compensation for the damage. 

T>UT there had been more 
damage than anyone knew 
at the time. A plant virus, similar 



to the tobacco mosaic, had mu- 
tated under the impact of radio- 
activity. Five years later, it burst 
out of the jungle and completely 
wiped out every last rice plant on 
Earth. Japan and a large part of 
Asia became semi-deserts inhab- 
ited by a few struggling nomads. 

Then the virus adjusted to 
wheat and corn — and famine 
howled in every street of the 
planet. All attempts by botanists 
to control the Blight failed be- 
cause of the swiftness of its on- 
slaught. And after it had fed, it 
hit again at a new plant and an- 
other and another. 

Most of the world’s non-human 
mammals had been slaughtered 
for food long before they could 
starve to death. Many insects, too, 
before they became extinct at the 
loss of their edible plants, served 
to assuage hunger to some small 
extent. 

But the nutritive potential of 
Earth was steadily diminishing in 
a horrifying geometric progression. 
Recently, it had been observed, 
plankton— the tiny organism on 
which most of the sea’s ecology 
was based — had started to disap- 
pear, and with its diminution, 
dead fish had begun to pile up 
on the beaches. 

Mankind had lunged out des- 
perately in all directions in an ef- 
fort to survive, but nothing had 
worked for any length of time. 
Even the other planets of the 



40 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Solar System, which had been 
reached and explored at a tre- 
mendous cost in remaining re- 
sources, had yielded no edible 
vegetation. Synthetics had failed 
to fill the prodigious gap. 

In the midst of the sharply in- 
creasing hunger, social controls 
had pretty much dissolved. Pa- 
thetic attempts at rationing still 
continued, but black markets be- 
came the only markets, and black 
marketeers the barons of life. 
Starvation took the hindmost, and 
only the most agile economically 
lived in comparative comfort. 
Law and order were had only by 
those who could afford to pay for 
them and children of impover- 
ished families were sold on the 
open market for a bit of food. 

But the Blight was still adjust- 
ing to new plants and the food 
supply kept shrinking. In an- 
other century . 

That was why the planet’s 
powerful individuals had been 
persuaded to pool their wealth in 
a desperate attempt to alter the 
past. This kind of world was 
manifestly impossible. 

Mac Albin finished the docu- 
ment and sighed. What a magnifi- 
cent world! What an exciting 
place to live! 

He dropped his hand on the 
side levers and began the process 
of materializing at the crucial mo- 
ment on April 18, 1976. 

flick! 

OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS 



A S THE equipment of the re- 
mote-control station began 
to take on a blurred reality all 
around him, Max Alben felt a bit 
of fear at what he was doing. The 
technicians, he remembered, the 
Secretary-General, even the black 
market kings, had all warned him 
not to go ahead with his instruc- 
tions if anything unusual turned 
up. That was an awful lot of 
power to disobey: he knew he 
should return with this new in- 
formation and let better minds 
work on it. 

They with their easy lives, what 
did they know what existence had 
been like for such as he? Hunger, 
always hunger, scrabbling, servil- 
ity, and more hunger. Every time 
things got really tight, you and 
your wife looking sideways at 
your kids and wondering which 
of them would bring the best 
price. Buying security for them, 
as he was now, at the risk of his 
life. 

But in this other world, this 
other 2089, there was a state that 
took care of you and that treas- 
ured your children. A man like 
himself, with five children — why, 
he’d be a big man, maybe the big- 
gest man on Earth! And he’d 
have robots to work for him and 
lots of food. Above all, lots and 
lots of food. 

He’d even be a scientist — 
everyone was a scientist there, 
weren’t they? — and he’d have a 

41 



big laboratory all to himself. This 
other world had its troubles, but 
it was a lot nicer place than where 
he’d come from. He wouldn’t re- 
turn. He’d go through with it. 

The fear left him and, for the 
first time in his life, Max Alben 
felt the sensation of power. 

He materialized the time ma- 
chine around the green instru- 
ment panel, sweating a bit at the 
sight of the roomful of military 
figures, despite the technicians’ 
reassurances that all this would 
be happening too fast to be visible. 
He saw the single red switch point- 
ing upward on the instrument 
panel. The switch that controlled 
the course of the missile. Now! 
Now to make a halfway decent 
world! 

Max Alben pulled the little red 
switch toward him. 

flick! 

A S THE equipment of the re- 
mote-control station began 
to oscillate into reality all around 
him, Mac Albin felt a bit of 
shame at what he was doing. He’d 
promised Bob and Hugo to drop 
the experiment at any stage if a 
new factor showed up. He knew he 
should go back with this new in- 
formation and have all three of 
them kick it around. 

But what would they be able 
to tell him, they with their bliss- 
ful adjustment to their thoroughly 
blueprinted lives? They, at least, 



had been ordered to marry 
women they could live with; he’d 
drawn a female with whom he 
was completely incompatible in 
any but a genetic sense. Genetics! 
He was tired of genetics and the 
sanctity of human life, tired to 
the tip of his uncalloused fingers, 
tired to the recesses of his unused 
muscles. He was tired of having 
to undertake a simple adventure 
like a thief in the night. 

But in this other world, this 
other 2089, someone like himself 
would be a monarch of the black 
market, a suzerain of chaos, mak- 
ing his own rules, taking his own 
women. So what if the weaklings, 
those unfit to carry on the race, 
went to the wall? His kind 
wouldn’t. 

He’d formed a pretty good idea 
of the kind of men who ruled that 
other world, from the document 
in the sealed metal cylinder. The 
black marketeers had not even 
read it. Why, the fools had obvi- 
ously been duped by the techni- 
cians into permitting the experi- 
ment; they had not grasped the 
idea that an alternate time track 
would mean their own non-exist- 
ence. 

This other world had its trou- 
bles, but it was certainly a live- 
lier place than where he’d come 
from. It deserved a chance. Yes, 
that was how he felt: his world 
was drowsily moribund; this al- 
ternate was starving but manag-

ing to flail away at destiny. It 
deserved a chance. 

Albin decided that he was ex- 
periencing renunciation and felt 
proud. 

He materialized the time ma- 
chine around the green instru- 
ment panel, disregarding the 
roomful of military figures since 
he knew they could not see him. 
The single red switch pointed 
downward on the instrument 
panel. That was the gimmick that 
controlled the course of the mis- 
sile. Now! Now to make a half-

TRACKING DOWN 

THE "SEA SERPENT" 
PART I 



W HILE rereading a book 
of reminiscences of the 
famous Austrian report- 
er Egon Erwin Kisch, I came 
across a little story which some- 
how seems applicable to the 
theme at hand. Talking about his 
days as a newspaperman in 
Prague, Kisch recalled an old edi- 
tor whose main function in his 
later years seems to have con- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sisted of belittling the news of the 
day. 

If a local reporter came into 
the office with a story of a large 
fire somewhere, the old man 
would hardly glance at the report 
which he turned over to the com- 
posing room, but would tell the 
reporter about a much bigger fire 
that had taken place some forty 
years earlier when he was a young 
reporter. Egon Erwin Kisch re- 
marked in his book that if a copy 
boy, white-faced, had come from 
the telegraph room with a wire 
stating that the Emperor (Franz 
Joseph of Austria-Hungary) had 
just died, the old editor probably 
would have replied: “Well, surely 
you did not expect such an old 
man to go on living forever.” 

You know how thoughts often 
connect the most improbable 
items that have occurred recently. 
A day or two earlier, I had re- 
ceived a letter from a reader in 
which I was asked whether I had 
any opinion about the tales of 
the “Sea Serpent.” Presumably 
this letter had been inspired by 
my article on Latimeria, which 
was on the newsstands then. 

But while reading Kisch’s book, 
I remembered that letter and the 
thought occurred to me what the 
old editor might have said if the 
copy boy had brought in a wire 
announcing that the “Sea Serpent 
mystery” had, at long last, been 
solved, presumably by capturing 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



one or by the discovery of a fresh 
carcass having been washed 
ashore. 

He might either have said: 
“Well, surely you did not really 
expect that all the creatures in 
the oceans are already known to 
science.” Or else he may have 
said: “Did you really think that 
this creature, which has been 
seen on many occasions for cen- 
turies, would remain undiscov- 
ered forever?” 

T> EFORE I go into the story it- 
self, it might be useful to 
mention that one does not have 
to dig through old newspaper files 
to come up with stories about 
something called the “sea serpent” 
and then have to wonder whether 
this is a bona fide report of a sea 
captain who simply told what he 
saw, or whether the story was 
made up at the office because 
there happened to be no other 
news, what with Congress ad- 
journed, the President on vaca- 
tion and European statesmen sit- 
ting out the hot months of the 
year at the seashore or in their 
mountain cottages. 

There are several books on the 
problem, one of which, at least, 
deserved to be called “profes- 
sional literature.” It was published 
in October, 1892, by a Dutch 
professor of Zoology, “Director of 
the Royal Zoological and Botani- 
cal Society at The Hague,” A. C. 

45 



Oudemans, Ph.D. It is an enor- 
mous book, nearly as large in size 
as the Encyclopaedia Britannica 
and about as thick as one of its 
volumes, containing 592 pages in 
rather small type. 

It contains reports on 187 
sightings of the disputed monster. 
In all cases where the witnesses 
were still alive in 1892, Dr. Oude- 
mans got in touch with them by 
mail to obtain the fullest possible 
documentation. 

Not quite four decades later, in 
1930, the second book devoted 
exclusively to the sea serpent saw 
print in London. The title of Dr. 
Oudemans’ book had been simply 
The Great Sea- Serpent (though 
written and printed in Holland, it 
was in English). The second book, 
by the late Lieutenant Com- 
mander Rupert T. Gould (R.N.), 
bore the title The Case for the 
Sea Serpent. Like Dr. Oudemans’ 
work, Commander Gould’s book 
was carefully documented, with 
cross-check by correspondence of 
all the stories where witnesses 
could still be reached. 

It is amusing to see how the 
professions of these two authors 
influenced both the style and con- 
tents of their books. Oudemans’ is 
primarily a zoological treatise, 
sometimes dull, with interesting 
(if somewhat far-fetched) zoologi- 
cal reasoning attached. Comman- 
der Gould’s book is better written 
by far and you never have to 



wonder about such nautical detail 
as type of vessel, precise location, 
weather conditions, etc. But when 
it comes to zoology, he opened the 
door to some nonsense, presum- 
ably for the sake of completeness. 

The same author later pub- 
lished another book called The 
Loch Ness Monster which is not 
as good a book, probably because 
it was rushed through typewriter 
and printing press. Professor 
Oudemans, then still alive, also 
wrote a few pamphlets on the 
Loch Ness monster, both in Dutch 
and in English. They don’t much 
more than state that the Loch 
Ness monster, if captured, would 
vindicate his position taken in 
1892. 

Additional sea serpent litera- 
ture can be found in a number of 
books devoted to the sea rather 
than to zoology. There is a round- 
up of the reports I thought most 
important in my book The Lung- 
fish, the Dodo and the Unicorn 
(New York 1948, Viking), which 
at least has the advantage over 
the other two of being still in 
print. 

* | 'HE so-called sea serpent mys- 
tery can be stated in a few sen- 
tences. If you eliminate all the 
sightings which fail to furnish a 
reasonably good description or 
where there is the least doubt 
about the veracity of the reporter, 
you end up with about half a hun- 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dred reports. They come from 
most of the seven seas, although 
the majority came from the At- 
lantic Ocean, which may simply 
be due to the fact that the Atlan- 
tic Ocean is more heavily trav- 
eled than any other. 

There seems to be no special 
preference for any latitude. In the 
Atlantic, sightings range from 
Greenland and Iceland all the 
way south to nearly the southern 
tip of Africa. There are several 
along the coast of Norway, one 
from the English Channel, one 
from the Mediterranean. In the 
Pacific, there is one from the vi- 
cinity of Hawaii, one from the 
Gulf of California, several off the 
California coast and some off 
Alaska. There were one or two in 
the Indian Ocean. The only one 
from Antarctic waters I recall at 
the moment was most likely a 
mistaken explanation. 

All these sightings could be ex- 
plained by a specific shape, first 
drawn up by Professor Oude- 
mans. This being the case, the 
easiest way out is to assume the 
existence of a large and officially 
unknown marine creature. If you 
do take this easy way out, you 
may speculate on what it is. Or 
what it could be. 

Let’s look at some of the most 
famous cases now. It is traditional, 
to some extent, to begin with 
Archbishop Olaus Magnus of 
Sweden. But I’ll just mention his 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



name, mostly because he was not 
an eyewitness himself, partly be- 
cause he wrote his book far from 
home, in Rome, at an advanced 
age, so that mistakes and distor- 
tions are to be expected. 

The oldest case to be quoted 
then will be that of Hans Egede, 
often called the “Apostle of 
Greenland,” on one of his mission- 
ary voyages, when off the west 
coast of Greenland. I’ll quote this 
verbatim: 

Anno 1734, July. On the 6th ap- 
peared a very terrible sea-monster 
which raised itself so high above the 
water that its head reached above 
our main-top. It had a long sharp 
snout, and blew like a whale, had 
broad, large flappers, and the body 
was, as it were, covered with hard 
skin, and it was very wrinkled and 
uneven on its skin; moreover on the 
lower part it was formed like a 
snake, and when it went under water 
again, it cast itself backwards and in 
so doing it raised its tail above the 
water, a whole ship-length from its 
body. That evening we had very bad 
weather. 

r I ^HE last sentence sounds a lit- 
tie like a non sequitur. What 
it is probably intended to convey 
is that prior to evening and at the 
time of the encounter, the weather 
was not bad. The later printed 
version of Egede’s journal is ac- 
companied by the picture shown 

47 



as Fig. 1, which you will find on 
the next page of this article. 

It is said to have been made 
originally by a Mr. Bing, who was 
one of the missionaries aboard; 
but there is no way of finding out 
any more how much time went 
by between the encounter and the 
making of the drawing. And un- 
fortunately it never occurred to 
Egede to state the dimensions of 
his ship anywhere. If we assume 
that it was a vessel of around 250 
tons, which is likely for the pe- 
riod, the raising of the head 
“above the main top” would 
bring it to a height of around 30 
feet above the water. It may be 
useful to add that Egede’s book 
contains several rather good pic- 
tures of the various kinds of 
whales seen during the same voy- 
age. 

The next report was made only 
a few years later, in 1745, by 
Commandant Lorenz von Ferry, 
who traveled on a small vessel 
along the coast of Norway from 
Trondhjem to Molde. The 
weather was fine and the animal 
passed close to the vessel, swim- 
ming faster than the men could 
row. For this reason, the Com- 
mandant took his gun, which 
happened to be loaded with small 
shot, and fired at the animal 
which immediately disappeared 
in the water and did not come up 
again, although the Commandant 
made the boat wait around for a 



while in hopes of a reappearance. 

Next came a flurry of reports 
from the New England coast, 
most of them in the form of sol- 
emn legal affidavits made and 
sworn to before the Honorable 
Lonson Nash, Justice of the Peace. 
The first witness — and, by a cu- 
rious circumstance, also the last 
to have seen it — was shipmaster 
Solomon Allen, whose testimony 
began as follows: 

I, Solomon Allen 3d, of Glouces- 
ter, in the County of Essex, Ship 
master, depose and say; that I have 
seen a strange marine animal, that I 
believe to be a serpent, in the harbor 
in said Gloucester. 

I should judge him to be between 
eighty and ninety feet in length, and 
about the size of a half-barrel, ap- 
parently having joints from his head 
to his tail. I was about one hundred 
and fifty yards from him, when I 
judged him to be of the size of a 
half-barrel. His head formed some- 
thing like the head of the rattle 
snake, but nearly as large as the 
head of a horse. When he moved on 
the surface of the water, his motion 
was slow, at times playing about in 
circles, and sometimes moving nearly 
straight forward. When he disap- 
peared, he sunk apparently directly 
down, and would next appear at two 
hundred yards from where he disap- 
peared, in two minutes. His color 
was a dark brown, and I did not dis- 
cover any spots upon him.

This ability of “sinking straight 
down” is one of the standard fea- 
tures of this series of reports as 
well as others. Lorenz von Ferry’s 
animal also disappeared immedi- 
ately under the water when hit. 

The next important case, and 
one of the most famous ones to 
this day, is the so-called Daedalus 
sea serpent. On August 6, 1848, 
Her Majesty’s ship Daedalus, 
commanded by Captain Peter 
M’Quhae, had reached a point in 
the South Atlantic, roughly half- 
way between the Cape of Good 
Hope and the island of St. Helena, 



returning from duty in the Indian 
Ocean. , 

In the afternoon of the date 
•mentioned, H.M.S. Daedalus 
passed a “sea serpent.” When the 
Daedalus arrived in London, 
word about the occurrence got out 
and was published in the Times 
and the captain was requested by 
the admiralty to state his position. 
He then wrote a letter to Admiral 
Sir W. H. Gage which I’ll quote in 
full, for authenticity; interest and 
flavor:

day’s date, requiring information as 
to the truth of a statement published 
in The Times newspaper, of a sea- 
serpent of extraordinary dimensions 
having been seen from Her Maj- 
esty’s ship Daedalus, under my com- 
mand, on her passage from the East 
Indies, I have the honour to acquaint 
you, for the information of my Lords 
Commissioners of the Admiralty, 
that at 5 o’clock p.m. on the 6th of 
August last, in latitude 24° 44' S., 
and longitude 9° 22' E., the weather 
dark and cloudy, wind fresh from the 
N.W., with a long ocean swell from 
the S.W., the ship on the port tack 
heading N.E. by N., something very 
unusual was seen by Mr. Sartoris, 
midshipman, rapidly approaching the 
ship from before the beam. The cir- 
cumstance was immediately reported 
by him to the officer of the watch, 
Lieut. Edgar Drummond, with whom 
and Mr. William Barrett, the Mas- 
ter, I was at the time walking the 
quarter-deck. The ship’s company 
were at supper. 

On our attention being called to 
the object it was discovered to be 
an enormous serpent, with head and 
shoulders kept about four feet con- 
stantly above the surface of the sea, 
and as nearly as we could approxi- 
mate by comparing it with the length 
of what our main-topsail yard should 
show in the water, there was at the 
very least 60 feet of the animal a 
fleur d’eau, no portion of which was, 
to our perception, used in propelling 
it through the water, either by verti- 

50 



cal or horizontal undulation. It 
passed rapidly, but so close under 
our lee quarter, that had it been a 
man of my acquaintance I should 
have easily recognized his features 
with the naked eye; and it did not, 
either in approaching the ship or 
after it had passed our wake, deviate 
in the slightest degree from its 
course to the S.W., which it held on 
at the pace of from 12 to 15 miles 
per hour, apparently on some deter- 
mined purpose. 

The diameter of the serpent was 
about 15 or 16 inches behind the 
head, which was, without any doubt, 
that of a snake, and it was never, 
during the 20 minutes that it contin- 
ued in sight of our glasses, once be- 
low the surface of the water; its col- 
our a dark brown, with yellowish 
white about the throat. It had no 
fins, but something like a mane of a 
horse, or rather a bunch of seaweed, 
washed about its back. It was seen 
by the quartermaster, the boat- 
swain’s mate, and the man at the 
wheel, in addition to myself and offi- 
cers above mentioned. 

C EVERAL pictures were drawn 
^ by artists under the direct su- 
pervision of Captain M’Quhae 
(fig. 2 and 3). To this day, they 
look as convincing as they are in- 
explicable. 

In the wake of the Daedalus 
story, several others were pub- 
lished, antedating it as far as the 
actual observation was concerned,

but not published until Captain 
McQuhae had stated: “This is 
what I saw, whether it can be ex- 
plained or not.” 

One of these belated reports is 
the Lady Combermere sea ser- 
pent — in the vast majority of 
cases they are named after the 
ship from which they were seen 
— which had been encountered in 
1820 . This sighting had taken 
place in the northern Atlantic and 
when the vessel approached the 
animal, it “reared head and neck 
out of the water and after taking 
a survey it all at once vanished.” 



Another report was that of the 
Royal Saxon, made by Dr. R. Da- 
vidson. The Royal Saxon was go- 
ing to India and was “a consider- 
able distance south-west of the 
Cape of Good Hope.” The water 
was “fine and smooth” and “it was 
in the middle of the day, and the 
other passengers were at lunch.” 
But though there were few people 
on deck, the captain (Petrie by 
name) was among them. As for 
the animal: 

It passed within 35 yards of the 
ship, without altering its course in the

least; but as it came right abreast of 
us, it slowly turned its head towards 
us. Apparently only about one-third 
of the upper part of its body was 
above water in nearly its whole 
length, and we could see the water 
curling up on its breadth as it moved 
along, but by what means it moved 
we could not perceive. 

Since Dr. Davidson wrote his 
report because of the Daedalus 
story, he was writing about twenty 
years after the event and did not 
remember the date any longer. 
He only knew that the Royal 



Saxon had sailed for India in 
1829. 

The next well-documented 
sighting took place only a few 
years later, a long distance away, 
on May 15, 1833, off Halifax, 
Nova Scotia. The observers were 
four commissioned officers of the 
Canadian forces and a Mr. Henry 
Ince who, though not holding a 
commission himself, was closely 
associated with the military, be- 
ing the ordnance storekeeper at 
Halifax. They were all on a fish- 
ing excursion together. The state- 
ment signed by everybody con-

tained the following paragraphs: 

At the distance of from 150 to 200 
yards on our starboard bow, we saw 
the head and neck of some denizen 
of the deep ... in the act of swim- 
ming, the head so far elevated and 
thrown forward by the curve of the 
neck as to enable us to see the water 
under and beyond it. The creature 
rapidly passed, leaving a regular wake 
from the commencement of which, to 
fore part, which was out of water, 
we judged its length to be about 80 
feet . There could be no mistake, 
no delusion ... It is most difficult to 
give correctly the dimensions of any 
object in the water. The head of the 
creature we set down at about six 
feet in length, and that portion of the 
neck which we saw, at the same; the 
extreme length, as before stated, at 
between 80 and 100 feet. The neck 
in thickness equalled the bole of a 
moderate-sized tree. The head and 
neck of a dark brown or nearly 
black colour, streaked with white in 
irregular streaks. I do not recollect 
seeing any part of the body. 

A NOTHER report published 
and presumably written in 
the wake of the Daedalus report 
was that of Captain George Hope, 
of H.M.S. Fly. Publication took 
place in the Zoologist (1849, p. 
2356), but the observation had 
been made in 1838. 

It was really an observation 
rather than an encounter: “In the 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



gulf of California, the sea being 
perfectly calm and transparent, we 
saw at the bottom a large marine 
animal, with the head and general 
figure of the alligator, except that 
the neck was much longer and 
that instead of legs the creature 
had four large flappers, somewhat 
like those of turtles . the crea- 
ture was distinctly visible, and all 
its movements could be observed 
with ease: it appeared to be pur- 
suing its prey at the bottom of the 
sea.” 

During the three decades fol- 
lowing the Daedalus incident, 
other reports came in, less spec- 
tacular than the Daedalus story, 
but most of them just as authen- 
tic. And then came somebody 
who could explain everything. 
His name was Henry Lee, his 
book was published in London in 
1883, and the title he picked for 
it was Sea Monsters Unmasked. 

Most of the time, Mr. Lee said, 
the sea serpent was merely a 
string of porpoises. Leaping 
through the water, the individual 
porpoises appear to be the sepa- 
rate convulsions of an enormous 
snake. 

Now it is quite possible that 
one or another landlubber was 
taken in by such a string of por- 
poises. But most of the reports 
quoted speak of a “wake” left by 
the animal; they say that it 
reared its head far out of the 
water as if to look around. Or 

53 



they say that the animal pro- 
gressed through the water at a 
rapid rate, but that they were not 
able to see the means of locomo- 
tion. All of this is something por- 
poises cannot possibly do. 

But Mr. Lee’s main explanation 
was a creature which, only fifty 
years earlier, had been every bit 
as “fabulous” or “mythical” as the 
sea serpent itself. It was the 
Kraken of Norse folklore, the 
giant squid. 

Actually, the giant squid had 
an even longer history than the 
sea serpent. A case of catching 
and subduing one had been re- 
ported by Pliny the Elder. In dis- 
guise, the giant squid appears in 
Homer’s Odyssey, strangely 
enough (or interestingly enough) 
in the same place where Pliny’s 
squid was killed. 

While generally doubted to be 
real at the outset of the nine- 
teenth century, the giant squid 
had been established as an actual 
creature during the decades pre- 
ceding Lee’s book. It is not too il- 
logical that Lee may have felt 
that the establishment of the ac- 
tual existence of a marine mon- 
ster should explain all the sight- 
ings. So the Daedalus case was 
redrawn as a giant squid swim- 
ming at the surface with its long 
tentacles trailing (Fig. 4). And 
Hans Egede’s sea monster could 
also be redrawn as a squid (Fig. 
5). 

54 



It was all very ingenious, but 
unfortunately it did not fit. The 
position of the squid drawn to ex- 
plain Egede is probably an impos- 
sibility. And the captain of the 
Daedalus, even though he prob- 
ably never saw a giant squid trav- 
eling in this manner— nobody 
else ever has — would have given 
a different description if the ani- 
mal was so close that he would 
have recognized a man at the 
same distance. 

r r , HEN came Professor Oude- 
mans and his big book. After, 
as has been told, quoting and col- 
lecting everything ever written on 
the sea serpent, he sat back 
against the background of his 
zoological knowledge and tried to 
sum up. 

The fact that the animal had 
so often been seen raising its head 
high out of the water indicated 
that it could as easily be a true 
serpent as a string of porpoises — 
meaning that it could be neither. 

A serpent can raise its head 
when traveling, whether on land or 
when swimming at the surface of 
a lake or river. I have watched 
swimming snakes rather often — 
and I admit in passing that it usu- 
ally happened because I threw 
them into the water to watch 
them swim — and from these per- 
sonal observations, as well as the 
reported observations of others, I 
know that they raise at best ten

per cent of their total length. 

If the head of the snake is 
raised three inches above the 
water, the snake is in all proba- 
bility 30 inches long, perhaps a 
little more. If the “sea serpent” 
raised its head 10 feet out of the 
water, that would make it 100 
feet long, which is at least three 
times the length of the largest 
known land snake. Moreover, a 
swimming serpent, even one of 
colossal dimensions, would not 
leave a “regular wake.” 

Most important, since a snake’s 
undulations are horizontal, no ob- 
server would ever be in doubt 
about the means of locomotion — 
they would be plainly visible. 

And as a final clincher, paddles 
were seen in quite a number of 
cases, some of which have not 
been mentioned in this article for 
lack of space. A serpent with pad- 
dles is no longer a serpent. 

Taking all this into account 
and also the fact that observa- 
tions in rather cold water are fre-

have adapted themselves to a ma- 
rine life live in the Indian Ocean 
and other decidedly warm bodies

proclaimed that it was his consid- 
ered opinion that the sea serpent 
was actually a mammal! 

I have to confess that, at this 
moment, I feel very much like the 
TV announcer who is told that he 
has 30 seconds left to introduce 
the “mystery guest.” Since I’ve

T HE Christmas party at the 
Boston branch of Harts- 
horne-Logan was threaten- 
ing to become more legendary 
than usual this Christmas. 

The farm machinery manager 
had already collapsed. When he 
slid under the table containing 
the drinks, Miss Pringle, who sold 
millinery, had screamed: “He’ll 
drown!” 

One out of every three dirty 
stories started by party attendees 
had remained unfinished, because 
each had reminded someone else 
of another story. 

The recently developed liquors 
which affected the bloodstream 
three times faster had driven 
away twinges of conscience about 
untrimmed trees and midnight 
church services. 

The star salesman for mankies 
and the gentleman who was in 
charge of the janitors were put- 
ting on a display of Burmese foot- 
wrestling in one corner of the gen- 
eral office. The janitor foreman 
weighed fifty pounds less than the 
Burma gentleman, who was the 
salesman’s customary opponent. 
So the climax of one tactic did 
not simply overturn the foreman. 
He glided through the air, crash- 
ing with a very loud thump 
against the wall. 

He wasn’t hurt. But the impact 
knocked the hallowed portrait of 
H. H. Hartshorne, co-founder, 
from its nail. It tinkled impos-

ingly as its glass splintered against 
the floor. 

HP HE noise caused a temporary 
lull in the gaiety. Several em- 
ployes even felt a passing suspi- 
cion that things might be getting 
out of hand. 

“It’s all in the spirit of good, 
clean fun!” cried Mr. Hawkins, 
the assistant general manager. 
Since he was the highest execu- 
tive present, worries vanished. 
Everyone felt fine. There was a 
scurry to shove the broken glass 
out of sight and to turn more at- 
tention to another type of glasses. 

Mr. Hawkins himself, acting by 
reflex, attempted to return the 
portrait to its place until new 
glass could be obtained. But the 
fall had sprung the frame at one 
corner and it wouldn’t hang 
straight. 

“We’d better put old H. H. 
away for safekeeping until after 
the holiday,” he told a small, 
blonde salesclerk who was be- 
neath his attention on any work- 
ing day. 

With the proper mixture of re- 
spect and bonhommie, he lifted 
the heavy picture out of its frame. 
A yellowed envelope slipped to 
the floor as the picture came free. 
Hawkins rolled the picture like a 
scroll and put it into a desk 
drawer, for later attention. Then 
he looked around for a drink that 
would make him feel even better. 

58 



A sorting clerk in the mail or- 
der department wasn’t used to 
liquor. She picked up the enve- 
lope and looked around vaguely 
for the mail-opening machine. 

“Hell, Milly, you aren’t work- 
ing!” someone shouted at her. 
“Have another!” 

Milly snapped out of it. She 
giggled, suppressed a ladylike 
belch and returned to reality. 
Looking at the envelope, she said: 
“Oh, I see. They must have stuck 
it in to tighten the frame. Gee, 
it’s old.” 

Mr. Hawkins had refreshed 
himself. He decided that he liked 
Milly’s voice. To hear more of it, 
he said to her : “I’ll bet that’s been 
in there ever since the picture was 
framed. There’s a company legend 
that that picture was put up the 
day this branch opened, eighty 
years ago.” 

“I didn’t know the company 
ever used buff envelopes like 
this.” Milly turned it over in her 
hands. The ancient glue crackled 
as she did so. The flap popped 
open and an old-fashioned order 
blank fell out. 

Mr. Hawkins’ eyes widened. He 
bent, reached painfully over his 
potbelly and picked up the order 
form. 

“This thing has never been proc- 
essed!” Raising his voice, he 
shouted jovially, “Hey, people! 
You’re all fired! Here’s an order 
that Hartshorne-Logan never 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



filled! We can’t have such care- 
lessness. This poor woman has 
waited eighty years for her mer- 
chandise!” 

lV|j ILLY was reading aloud the 
scrawled words on the order 

form : 

“Best electric doorbell. Junior 
detective kit. Disposable sacks for 
vacuum cleaner. Dress for three- 
year-old girl.” She turned to the 
assistant general manager, struck 
with an idea for the first time in 
her young life. “Let’s fill this order 
right now!” 

“The poor woman must be dead 
by now,” he objected, secretly 
angry that he hadn’t thought of 
such a fine party stunt himself. 
Then he brightened. “Unless—” 
he said it loud enough for the em- 
ployes to scent a great proposal 
and the room grew quiet —“unless 
we broke the rules just once and 
used the time warp on a big mis- 
sion!” 

There was a silence. Finally, 
from an anonymous voice in one 
corner: “Would the warp work 
over eighty years? We were al- 
ways told that it must be used 
only for complaints within three 
days.” 

“Then let’s find out!” Mr. 
Hawkins downed the rest of his 
drink and pulled a batch of keys 
from his pocket. “Someone scoot 
down to the warehouse. Tell the 
watchman that it’s on my au- 



thority. Hunt up the stuff that’s 
on the order. Get the best of 
everything. Ignore the catalogue 
numbers — they’ve changed a hun- 
dred times in all these years.” 
Milly was still deciphering the 
form. Now she let out a little 
squeal of excitement. 

“Look, Mr. Hawkins! The name 
on this order — it’s my great- 
grandmother! Isn’t that wonder- 
ful? I was just a little girl when 
she died. I can barely remember 
her as a real old woman. But I 
remember that my grandmother 
never bought anything from 
Hartshorne-Logan because of 
some trouble her mother had once 
with the firm. My mother didn’t 
want me to come to work here 
because of that.” 

Mr. Hawkins put his arm 
around Milly in a way that he in- 
tended to look fatherly. It didn’t. 
“Well, now. Since it’s your rela- 
tive, let’s thrill the old girl. We 
wouldn’t have vacuum sacks any 
more. So we’ll substitute a 
manky!” 

A NN HARTLEY was return'- 
ing from mailing the letter 
when she found the large parcel 
on her doorstep. She put her 
hands on her hips and stared pug- 
naciously at the bundle. 

“The minute I write a letter to 
complain about you, you turn 
up!” she told the parcel. She 
nudged her toe peevishly against

59 



the brown paper wrappings that 
were tied with a half-transparent 
twine she had never seen before. 

The label was addressed in a 
wandering scrawl, a sharp contrast 
to the impersonal typing on the 
customary Hartshorne- Logan 
bundles. But the familiar RAT- 
TLE OK sticker was pasted 
onto the box, indicating to the 
delivery man that the contents 
would make a rattling sound and 
therefore hadn’t been broken in 
shipment. 

Ann sighed and picked up her 
bundle. With a last look at the 
lovely spring afternoon and the 
quiet suburban landscape, she 
went into the house. 

Two-year-old Sally heard the 
box rattling. She waddled up on 
chubby legs and grabbed her 
mother’s skirt. “Want!” she said 
decisively. 

“Your dress ought to be here,” 
Ann said. She found scissors in 
her sewing box, tossed a cushion 
onto the floor, sat on it, and began 
to open the parcel. 

“Now I’ll have to write another 
letter to explain that they should 
throw away my letter of com- 
plaint,” she told her daughter. 
“And by the time they get my 
second letter, they’ll have an- 
swered my first letter. Then they’ll 
write again.” Out of consideration 
for Sally, she omitted the exple- 
tives that she wanted to add. 

The translucent cord was too 



tough for the scissors. Ann was 
about to hunt for a razor blade 
when Sally clutched at an inter- 
section of the cord and yanked. 
The twine sprang away from the 
carton as if it wer^ alive. The 
paper wrappings flapped open. 

“There!” Sally said. 

Ann repressed an irrational 
urge to slap her daughter. Instead, 




60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




she tossed the wrappings aside 
and removed the lid from the car- 
ton. A slightly crushed thin card- 
board box lay on top. Ann pulled 
out the dress and shook it into a 
freely hanging position. Then she 
groaned. 

It was green and she had or- 
dered blue. It didn’t remotely re- 
semble the dress she had admired 



from the Hartshorne-Logan cata- 
logue illustration. Moreover, the 
shoulders were lumpier than any 
small girl’s dress should be. 

But Sally was delighted. 
“Mine!” she shrilled, grabbing for 
the dress. 

“It’s probably the wrong size, 
too,” Ann said, pulling off Sally’s 
dress to try it on. “Let’s find as 




RATTLE OK 



61 



many things to complain about as 
we can.” 

HPHE dress fitted precisely, ex- 
cept for the absurd shoulder 
bumps. Sally was radiant for a 
moment. Then her small face so- 
bered and she started to look va- 
cantly at the distant wall. 

“We’ll have to send it back,” 
Ann said, “and get the one we 
ordered.” 

She tried to take it off, but the 
child squawked violently. Ann 
grabbed her daughter’s arms, held 
them above her head and pulled 
at the dress. It seemed to be stuck 
somewhere. When Ann released 
the child’s arms to loosen the 
dress, Sally squirmed away. She 
took one step forward, then began 
to float three inches above the 
ground. She landed just before 
she collided with the far wall. 

Sally looked scared until she 
saw her mother’s face. Then she 
squealed in delight. 

Ann’s legs were rubber. She 
was shaking her head and wob- 
bling uncertainly toward her 
daughter when the door opened 
behind her. 

“It’s me,” her husband said. 
“Slow day at the office, so I came 
home early.” 

“Les! I’m going crazy or some- 
thing. Sally just—” 

Sally crouched to jump at her 
father. Before she could leap, he 
grabbed her up bodily and hugged 

62 



her. Then he saw the box. 

“Your order’s here? Good. 
What’s this thing?” He was look- 
ing at a small box he had pulled 
from the carton. Its lid contained 
a single word: MANKY. The box 
rattled when he shook it. 

Les pulled off the lid and found 
inside a circular, shiny metal ob- 
ject. A triangular trio of jacks 
stuck out from one end. 

“Is this the doorbell? I’ve never 
seen a plug like this. And there’s 
no wire.” 

“I don’t know,” Ann said. “Les, 
listen. A minute ago, Sally—” 

He peered into the box for an 
instruction sheet, uselessly. “They 
must have made a mistake. It 
looks like some kind of farm 
equipment.” 

He tossed the manky onto the 
hassock and delved into the car- 
ton again. Sally was still in his 
arms. 

“That’s the doorbell, I think,” 
he said, looking at the next ob- 
ject. It had a lovely, tubular 
shape, a half-dozen connecting 
rods and a plug for a wall socket. 

“That’s funny,” Ann mused, her 
mind distracted from Sally for a 
moment. “It looks terribly expen- 
sive. Maybe they sent door 
chimes instead of the doorbell.” 

The bottom of the carton con- 
tained the detective outfit that 
they had ordered for their son. 
Ann glanced at its glaringly lith- 
ographed cover and said: “Les, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mI >out Sally. Put her down a min- 
ute and watch what she does.” 

I ES stared at his wife and put 
* J the child onto the rug. Sally 
began to walk, then rose and 
1 1 gain floated, this time toward the 
hassock on which the manky lay. 

His jaw dropped. “My God! 
Ann, what — ” 

Ann was staring, too, but not 
at her daughter. “Les! The has- 
sock! It used to be brown!” 

The hassock was a livid shade 
of green. A neon, demanding, 
.creaming green that clashed hor- 
i ibly with the soft browns and 
ieds in which Ann had furnished 
the room. 

“That round thing must be 
leaking,” Les said. “But did you 
nee Sally when she—” 

Ann’s frazzled nerves carried a 
Irantic order to her muscles. She 
jumped up, strode to the hassock 
and picked up the manky with 
two fingers. She tossed it to Les. 
Immediately, she regretted her 
action. 

“Drop it!” she yelled. “Maybe 
it’ll turn you green, too!” 

Les kicked the hassock into the 
hall closet, tossed the manky in 
after it and shut the door firmly. 
As the door closed, he saw the 

■ i it ire interior of the dark closet 
brighten into a wet-lettuce green. 

When he turned back to Ann, 

■ lie was staring at her left hand. 
The wedding band that Les had 



put there a dozen years ago was 
a brilliant green, shedding its soft 
glow over the finger up to the 
first knuckle. 

Ann felt the scream building 
up inside her. She opened her 
mouth to let it out, then put her 
hand in front of her mouth to 
keep it in, finally jerked the hand 
away to prevent the glowing ring 
from turning her front teeth green. 

She collapsed into Les’s arms, 
babbling incomprehensibly. 

He said: “It’s all right. There 
must be balloons or something in 
the shoulders of that dress. I’ll 
tie a paperweight to Sally’s dress 
and that’ll hold her down until we 
undress her. Don’t worry. And 
that green dye or whatever it is 
will wash off.” 

Ann immediately felt better. 
She put her hands behind her 
back, pulled off her ring and 
slipped it into her apron pocket. 
Les was sentimental about her 
removing it. 

“I’ll get dinner,” she said, try- 
ing to keep her voice on an even 
keel. “Maybe you’d better start a 
letter to Hartshorne-Logan. Let’s 
go into the kitchen, Sally.” 

Ann strode resolutely toward 
the rear of the house. She kept 
her eyes determinedly off the 
tinge of green that was showing 
through the apron pocket and 
didn’t dare look back at her 
daughter’s unsettling means of 
propulsion.

A HALF-HOUR later, when 
the meal was almost ready, 
two things happened: Bob came 
home from school through the 
back door and a strange voice 
said from the front of the house, 
“Don’t answer the front door.” 

Ann stared at her son. He 
stared back at her, the detective 
outfit under his arm. 

She went into the front room. 
Her husband was standing with 
fists on hips, looking at the front 
door, chuckling. “Neatest trick 
I’ve seen in a long time. That 
voice you heard was the new 
doorbell. I put it up while you 
were in the kitchen. Did you hear 
what happened when old lady 
Burnett out there pushed the but- 
ton?” 

“Oh. Something like those name 
cards with something funny 
printed on them, like ‘Another 
hour shot.’ Well, if there’s a little 
tape in there repeating that mes- 
sage, you’d better shut that part 
off. It might get boring after a 
while. And it might insult some- 
one.” 

Ann went to the door and 
turned the knob. The door didn’t 
open. The figure of Mrs. Burnett, 
half-visible through the heavy 
curtain, shifted impatiently on the 
porch. 

Les yanked at the doorknob. It 
didn’t yield for him, either. He 
looked up at the doorbell, which 
he had installed just above the 

64 



upper part of the door frame. 

“Queer,” he said. “That isn’t in 
contact with the door itself. I 
don’t see how it can keep the door 
from opening.” 

Ann put her mouth close to 
the glass, shouting: “Won’t you 
come to the back door, Mrs. Bur- 
nett? This one is stuck.” 

“I just wanted to borrow some 
sugar,” the woman cried from the 
porch. “I realize that I’m a ter- 
rible bother.” But she walked 
down the front steps and disap- 
peared around the side of the 
house. 

“Don’t open the back door.” 
The well-modulated voice from 
the small doorbell box threatened 
to penetrate every corner of the 
house. Ann looked doubtfully at 
her husband’s lips. They weren’t 
moving. 

“If this is ventriloquism—” she 
began icily. 

“I’ll have to order another door- 
bell just like this one, for the 
office,” Les said. “But you’d better 
let the old girl in. No use letting 
her get peeved.” 

The back door was already 
open, because it was a warm day. 
The screen door had no latch, 
held closed by a simple spring. 
Ann pushed it open when Mrs. 
Burnett waddled up the three 
back steps, and smiled at her 
neighbor. 

“I’m so sorry you had to walk 
around the house. It’s been a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rather hectic day in an awful lot 
of ways.” 

SOMETHING seemed to im- 
^ pede Mrs. Burnett as she 
came to the threshold. She 
frowned and shoved her portly 
frame against something invisible. 
It apparently yielded abruptly, 
because she staggered forward 
into the kitchen, nearly falling. 
She stared grimly at Ann and 
looked suspiciously behind her. 

“The children have some new 
toys,” Ann improvised hastily. 
“Sally is so excited over a new 
dress that she’s positively fever- 
ish. Let’s see now — it was sugar 
that you want, wasn’t it?” 

“I already have it,” Bob said, 
handing a filled cup to his mother. 
The boy turned back to the detec- 
tive set which he had spread over 
the kitchen table. 

“Excitement isn’t good for me,” 
Mrs. Burnett said testily. “I’ve had 
a lot of troubles in my life. I like 
peace and quiet.” 

“Your husband is better?” 
“Worse. I’m sure I don’t know 
why everything happens to me.” 
Mrs. Burnett edged toward the 
hall, trying to peer into the front 
of the house. Ann stood squarely 
in front of the door leading to the 
hall. Defeated, Mrs. Burnett left. 
A muffled volley of handclapping, 
mixed with a few faint cheers, 
came from the doorbell-box when 
she crossed the threshold. 



Ann went into the hall to order 
Les to disconnect the doorbell. 
She nearly collided with him, 
coming in the other direction. 

“Where did this come from?” 
Les held a small object in the 
palm of his hand, keeping it away 
from his body. A few drops of 
something unpleasant were drip- 
ping from his fingers. The object 
looked remarkably like a human 
eyeball. It was human-size, com- 
plete with pupil, iris and rather 
bloodshot veins. 

“Hey, that’s mine,” Bob said. 
“You know, this is a funny detec- 
tive kit. That was in it. But there 
aren’t instructions on how it 
works.” 

“Well, put it away,” Ann told 
Bob sharply. “It’s slimy.” 

Les laid the eyeball on the 
table and walked away. The eye- 
ball rolled from the smooth, level 
table, bounced twice when it hit 
the floor, then rolled along, six 
inches behind him. He turned 
and kicked at it. The eyeball 
rolled nimbly out of the path of 
the kick. 

“Les, I think we’ve made poor 
Mrs. Burnett angry,” Ann said. 
“She’s so upset over her poor hus- 
band’s health and she thinks we’re 
insulting her.” 

Les didn’t hear her. He strode 
to the detective set, followed at a 
safe distance by the eyeball, and 
picked up the box. 

“Hey, watch out!” Bob cried. A 



RATTIE OK 



65 



small flashlight fell from the box, 
landed on its side and its bulb 
flashed on, throwing a pencil of 
light across Les’s hands. 

T> OB retrieved the flashlight 
and turned it off while Les 
glanced through an instruction 
booklet, frowning. 

“This toy is too complicated 
for a ten-year-old boy,” Les told 
his wife. “I don’t know why you 
ordered such a thing.” He tossed 
the booklet into the empty box. 

“I’m going to return it, if you 
don’t smudge it up,” she replied. 
“Look at the marks you made on 
the instructions.” The black finger- 
marks stood out clearly against 
the shiny, coated paper. 

Les looked at his hands. “I 
didn’t do it,” he said, pressing his 
clean fingertips against the kitchen 
table. 

Black fingerprints, a full set of 
them, stood out against the 
sparkling polished table’s surface. 

“I think the Detectolite did it,” 
Bob said. “The instructions say 
you’ve got to be very careful with 
it, because its effects last for a 
long time.” 

Les began scrubbing his hands 
vigorously at the sink. Ann 
watched him silently, until she 
saw his fingerprints appear on the 
faucet, the soap and the towel. 
She began to yell at him for mak- 
ing such a mess, when Sally 
floated into the kitchen. The girl 



was wearing a nightgown. 

“My God!” Ann forgot her 
tongue before the children. “She 
got out of that dress herself. 
Where did she get that night- 
gown?” 

Ann fingered the garment. She 
didn’t recognize it as a night- 
gown. But in cut and fold, it was 
suspiciously like the dress that 
had arrived in the parcel. Her 
heart sank. 

She picked up the child, felt 
the hot forehead, and said: “Les, 
I think it’s the same dress. It must 
change color or something when 
it’s time for a nap. It seems im- 
possible, but — ” She shrugged 
mutely. “And I think Sally’s run- 
ning a temperature. I’m going to 
put her to bed.” 

She looked worriedly into the 
reddened eyes of the small girl, 
who whimpered on the way to the 
bedroom. Ann carried her up the 
stairs, keeping her balance with 
difficulty, as Sally threatened to 
pop upward out of her arms. 

The whole family decided that 
bed might be a good idea, soon 
after dinner. When the lights 
went out, the house seemed to be 
nearly normal. Les put on a pair 
of gloves and threw a pillowcase 
over the eyeball. Bob rigged up 
trestles to warn visitors from the 
front porch. Ann put small wads 
of cotton into her ears, because 
she didn’t like the rhythmic rat- 
tle, soft but persistent, that 



66

emerged from the hall closet 
where the manky sat. Sally was 
whining occasionally in her sleep. 

%W/"HEN daylight entered her 
room, Sally’s nightgown had 
turned back into the new dress. 
But the little girl was too sick to 
get out of bed. She wasn’t hun- 
gry, her nose was running, and she 
had a dry cough. Les called the 
doctor before going to work. 

The only good thing about the 
morning for Ann was the fact that 
the manky had quieted down 
some time in the night. After she 
got Bob to school, she gingerly 
opened the closet door. The 
manky was now glowing a bright 
pink and seemed slightly larger. 
Deep violet lettering stood out on 
its side: 

“Today is Wednesday. For ob- 
vious reasons, the manky will not 
operate today.” 

The mailman brought a letter 
from Hartshorne-Logan. Ann 
stared stupidly at the envelope, 
until she realized that this wasn’t 
an impossibly quick answer to the 
letter she had written yesterday. 
It must have crossed in the mail 
her complaint about the non-ar- 
rival of the order. She tore open 
the envelope and read: 

“We regret to inform you that 
your order cannot be filled until 
the balance you owe us has been 
reduced. From the attached form, 
you will readily ascertain that the 



payment of $87.56 will enable 
you to resume the purchasing of 
merchandise on credit. We shall 
fill your recent order as soon . 

Ann crumpled the letter and 
threw it into the imitation fire- 
place, knowing perfectly well that 
it would need to be retrieved for 
Les after work tonight. She had 
just decided to call Hartshorne- 
Logan’s complaint department 
when the phone rang. 

“I’m afraid I must ask you to 
come down to the school, Mrs. 
Morris,” a voice said. “Your son 
is in trouble. He claims that it’s 
connected with something that his 
parents gave him.” 

“My son?” Ann asked incredu- 
lously. “Bob?” 

“Yes. It’s a little gadget that 
looks like a water pistol. Your 
son insists that he didn’t know it 
would make clothing transparent. 
He claims it was just accident 
that he tried it out when he was 
walking by the gym during calis- 
thenics. We’ve had to call upon 
every family in the neighborhood 
for blankets. Bob has always been 
a good boy and we believe that 
we can expel him quietly without 
newspaper publicity involving his 
name, if you’ll—” 

“I’ll be right down,” Ann said. 
“I mean I won’t be right down. 
I’ve got a sick baby here. Don’t 
do anything till I telephone my 
husband. And I’m sorry for Bob. 
I mean I’m sorry for the girls, and 



RATTLE OK 



67 



for the boys, too. I’m sorry for — 
for everything. Good-by.” 

J UST as she hung up the tele- 
phone, the doorbell rang. It 
rang with a normal buzz, then be- 
gan to play soft music. Ann 
opened the door without diffi- 
culty, to admit Dr. Schwartz. 

“You aren’t going to believe 
me, Doctor,” Ann said while he 
took the child’s temperature, “but 
we can’t get that dress off Sally.” 
“Kids are stubborn sometimes.” 
Dr. Schwartz whistled softly 
when he looked at the thermom- 
eter. “She’s pretty sick. I want a 
blood count before I try to move 
her. Let me undress her.” 

Sally had been mumbling half- 
deliriously. She made no effort 
to resist as the doctor picked her 
up. But when he raised a fold of 
the dress and began to pull it 
back, she screamed. 

The doctor dropped the dress 
and looked in perplexity at the 
point where it touched Sally’s 
skin. 

“It’s apparently allergy to some 
new kind of material. But I don’t 
understand why the dress won’t 
come off. It’s not stuck tight.” 
“Don’t bother trying,” Ann said 
miserably. “Just cut it off.” 

Dr. Schwartz pulled scissors 
from his bag and clipped at a 
sleeve. When he had cut it to the 
shoulder, he gently began to peel 
back the edges of the cloth. Sally 

68 



writhed and kicked, then collapsed 
in a faint. The physician smoothed 
the folds hastily back into place. 

He looked helpless as he said 
to Ann: “I don’t know quite what 
to do. The flesh starts to hemor- 
rhage when I pull at the cloth. 
She’d bleed to death if I yanked 
it off. But it’s such an extreme 
allergy that it may kill her, if we 
leave it in contact with the skin.” 
The manky’s rattle suddenly 
began rhythmically from the 
lower part of the house. Ann 
clutched the side of the chair, try- 
ing to keep herself under control. 
A siren wailed somewhere down 
the street, grew louder rapidly, 
suddenly going silent at the peak 
of its crescendo. 

Dr. Schwartz glanced outside 
the window. “An ambulance. 
Looks as if they’re stopping here.” 
“Oh, no,” Ann breathed. “Some- 
thing’s happened to Les.” 

“It sure will,” Les said grimly, 
walking into the bedroom. “I 
won’t have a job if I can’t get this 
stuff off my fingers. Big black fin- 
gerprints on everything I touch. I 
can’t handle correspondence or 
shake hands with customers. 
How’s the kid? What’s the ambu- 
lance doing out front?” 

“They’re going to the next 
house down the street,” the physi- 
cian said. “Has there been sick- 
ness there?” 

Les held up his hands, palms 
toward the doctor. “What’s wrong 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with me? My fingers look all 
right. But they leave black marks 
on everything I touch.” 

The doctor looked closely at 
the fingertips. “Every human has 
natural oil on the skin. That’s how 
detectives get results with their 
fingerprint powder. But I’ve never 
heard of nigrification, in this 
sense. Better not try to commit 
any crimes until you’ve seen a 
skin specialist.” 

A NN was peering through the 
window, curious about the 
ambulance despite her own trou- 
bles. She saw two attendants 
carry Mr. Burnett, motionless and 
white, on a stretcher from the 
house next door into the ambu- 
lance. A third member of the 
crew was struggling with a dishev- 
eled Mrs. Burnett at the door. 
Shrieks that sounded like “Mur- 
der!” came sharply through the 
window. 

“I know those bearers,” Dr. 
Schwartz said. He yanked the 
window open. “Hey, Pete! What’s 
wrong?” 

The front man with the stretcher 
looked up. “I don’t know. This 
guy’s awful sick. I think his wife 
is nuts.” 

Mrs. Burnett had broken free. 
She dashed halfway down the 
sidewalk, gesticulating wildly to 
nobody in particular. 

“It’s murder!” she screamed. 
“Murder again! He’s been poi- 



soned! He’s going to die! It means 
the electric chair!” 

The orderly grabbed her again. 
This time he stuffed a handker- 
chief into her mouth to quiet her. 

“Come back to this house as 
soon as you deliver him,” Dr. 
Schwartz shouted to the men. 
“We’ve got a very sick child up 
here.” 

“I was afraid this would hap- 
pen,” Les said. “The poor woman 
already has lost three husbands. 
If this one is sick, it’s no wonder 
she thinks that somebody is poi- 
soning him.” 

Bob stuck his head around the 
bedroom door. His mother stared 
unbelievingly for a moment, then 
advanced on him threateningly. 
Something in his face restrained 
her, just as she was about to start 
shaking him. 

“I got something important to 
tell you,” Bob said rapidly, ready 
to duck. “I snuck out of the prin- 
cipal’s office and came home. I 
got to tell you what I did.” 

“I heard all about what you 
did,” Ann said, advancing again. 
“And you’re not going to slip 
away from me.” 

“Give me a chance to explain 
something. Downstairs. So he 
won’t hear,” Bob ended in a whis- 
per, nodding toward the doctor. 

A NN looked doubtfully at Les, 
then followed Bob down the 
stairs. The doorbell was monoto- 



R ATTIE OK 



69 



nously saying in a monotone: 
“Don’t answer me, don’t answer 
me, don’t go to the door.” 

“Why did you do it?” Ann 
asked Bob, her anger suddenly 
slumping into weary sadness. 
“People will suspect you of being 
a sex maniac for the rest of your 
life. You can’t possibly explain — ” 
“Don’t bother about the girls’ 
clothing,” Bob said, “because it 
was only an accident. The really 
important thing is something else 
I did before I left the house.” 
Les, cursing softly, hurried past 
them on the way to answer the 
knocking. He ignored the door- 
bell’s pleas. 

“I forgot about it,” Bob contin- 
ued, “when that ray gun acciden- 
tally went off. Then when they 
put me in the principal’s office, I 
had time to think, and I remem- 
bered. I put some white stuff from 
the detective kit into that sugar 
we lent Mrs. Burnett last night. I 
just wanted to see what would 
happen. I don’t know exactly 
what effect — ” 

“He put stuff in the sugar?” A 
deep, booming voice came from 
the front of the house. Mother 
and son looked through the hall. 
A policeman stood on the thresh- 
old of the front door. “I heard 
that! The woman next door claims 
that her husband is poisoned. 
Young man, I’m going to put you 
under arrest.” 

The policeman stepped over 



the threshold. A blue flash darted 
from the doorbell box, striking 
him squarely on the chest. The 
policeman staggered back, sitting 
down abruptly on the porch. A 
scent of ozone drifted through the 
house. 

“Close the door, close the door,” 
the doorbell was chanting ur- 
gently. 

“Where’s that ambulance?” Dr. 
Schwartz yelled from the top of 
the steps. “The child’s getting 
worse.” 

Something splintered in the hall 
closet door. The manky zoomed 
through the hole it had broken 
and began ricocheting wildly 
through the house like a crazed 
living creature, smashing orna- 
ments, cracking the plaster. 

Les rushed through the front 
door to try to pick up the police- 
man. The officer drew his gun. An 
unearthly scream of “Help!” 
shrieked out of the doorbell. 

Ann put her hands over her 
eyes, as if that would make the 
unbelievable scene vanish. 

r 1 1 HREE days after the Christ- 
-*■ mas party, in the middle of 
inventory, when her headache 
had completely vanished, Milly 
began to worry. 

She talked the situation over 
for one whole afternoon with her 
best friend at Hartshorne-Logan, 
a girl in the complaint depart- 
ment. That same evening, after 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



work, Milly went to the public 
library for the first time in her 
life. She borrowed a thick tome 
on the theory of time travel. But 
only three sentences in the first 
ten pages were comprehensible to 
her. She turned to her manky for 
comfort before going to bed. 

The next morning, she braved 
the protective screen of secreta- 
ries, receptionists and sub-officials 
who ordinarily protected Mr. 
Hawkins from minor annoyances, 
and penetrated to his office. 

Mr. Hawkins didn’t recognize 
her when she walked in. His at- 
titude became much more formal 
when she reminded him of their 
actions on Christmas Eve. 

“So you see, Mr. Hawkins,” 
Milly concluded earnestly, “I’m 
worried. We had so much fun at 
that party that we didn’t think 
about what we might do to those 
folks in the past.” 

“You should understand,” Mr. 
Hawkins firmly replied, “that I 
was not enjoying myself at the 
party. Definitely not. I must en- 
gage in the painful duty of assum- 
ing a pose of gaiety on special oc- 
casions, such as the annual office 
party.” 

Milly shot him a withering 
look, but didn’t argue that par- 
ticular point. She continued: “So 
I’ve been thinking. We might 
have done a terrible thing. Send- 
ing that dress to a kid without the 
right underclothing could be real 

RATTLE OK 



dangerous. Maybe even fatal.” 
“We cannot harm people in the 
long ago, any more than the past 
could conceivably harm us.” 

“But don’t you see?” Milly 
fought to restrain tears of fright 
and frustration. “I’m not sure! 
And it’s the most important thing 
in the world to me. That little girl 
who got the dress is my grand- 
mother. If she died while she was 
a little girl, there wouldn’t be any 
me. I can’t be born, if my grand- 
mother died before she was three 
years old.” 

“The paradoxes of time travel 
have been greatly exaggerated,” 
Mr. Hawkins said. “Perhaps a 
genealogist would be able to clear 
up the question.” 

Tl/ITLLY rose to her full five- 
foot height, suddenly furious. 
“You don’t care if I just vanish 
all of a sudden! All that you care 
about is keeping yourself out of a 
lot of bother!” She turned on her 
heel, walked to the door, and 
added:- “After I’ve helped to fill 
forty orders every working day 
for the past three years!” 

Milly stalked out and slammed 
the door behind her. Then she 
stopped, just outside the door, 
waiting for a chain reaction to oc- 
cur. It did, about five seconds 
later. 

Mr. Hawkins popped through 
the door with a shout: “Where’s 
that girl?” He was through the 

71 



reception room and halfway down 
the hall when Milly called him 
back. 

“Here I am,” she said sweetly. 

He grabbed her arm and yanked 
her into his office. 

“You know,” he said, “I’ve been 
thinking about those poor, unfor- 
tunate people in the past, too. 
Now that you mention it, I be- 
lieve we should do something for 
them.” He wiped his forehead. 

“You’ve been thinking about a 
poor, unfortunate manager right 
here in the present,” Milly re- 
torted, sure of her position now. 1 
“All of a sudden, you’ve figured \ 
out what it will mean if I vanish 
because my grandmother never A 
had any children. You realize that 
if I’ve never existed, all of a sud- 1 
den Hartshorne-Logan will have 
thousands of complaint letters, 
lawsuits about orders over the 
past three years. You’re thinking 
about what’s going to happen to 
your position, if you’re to blame 
for all those customers not get- 
ting their merchandise.” 

Mr. Hawkins turned away until 
he got his face under control. 
“We’ll talk about that later,” he 
said mildly at last. “Let’s agree 
that everyone will be happier if 
we straighten up matters. And 
don’t you think that just we two 
should do the straightening up 
ourselves? It’ll be simpler if — uh 
— other officials don’t hear about 
this.” 




YV7HEN Ann took her hands 
* * away from her eyes the mess 
was still more complicated. The 
new factor was a short young girl 
who was walking up to the house. 
She was looking about, like a 
country girl suddenly whisked to 
Times Square. 

The policeman whirled when 
he heard footsteps behind him. 
“What do you want?” 

“I’m afraid that I’m to blame 
for the whole thing,” Milly told 
the officer. “I represent Harts- 
horne-Logan. We’ve just discov- 
ered that we made several mis- 
takes when we filled an order for 
this family. I’ve come to pick up 
the wrong merchandise.” 

The doorbell made ominous 
clucking sounds as Milly reached 
the threshold. 

She looked up at the box and 
told Ann: “I’m afraid that I can’t 
get in while that defective door- 
bell is working. Will you cut off 
the house current for a minute, 
while I disconnect it?” 

Les blinked at her, then began 
to curse, loudly and bitterly. 
“Why didn’t I think of that?” 

Les dodged the manky’s careen- 
ing and headed for the fuse box. 

Milly called after him : “Maybe 
there are bananas in the refrigera- 
tor. Take them out right away, if 
there are. The manky will quiet 
down then.” 

Ann rushed to the kitchen, 
yanked out the three bananas and 



RATTLE OK 



73 



threw them through the open 
window. She heard the dull thud 
from the front room as the manky 
fell to the carpet and lay motion- 
less. 

“I’ve pulled the switch!” Les 
yelled. 

The policeman warily stepped 
through the door, looking at Les. 
Dr. Schwartz intercepted the po- 
liceman. 

“Officer,” Dr. Schwartz said, 
“there’s a very sick little girl up- 
stairs. I think you’ll do your duty 
best by trying to hurry up an 
ambulance.” 

“But there’s a murder charge 
floating around and I practically 
heard a confession,” the police- 
man protested, slightly dazed. 

Milly had pulled down the 
doorbell assembly. She put it be- 
side the manky, then scooped up 
the remaining sections of Bob’s 
detective kit and put them on the 
pile. She headed for the stairs, 
calling over her shoulder: “Don’t 
worry about your detective set 
troubles. Those things wear off in 
twenty-four hours.” 

S TAGGERING slightly under 
the load of merchandise, 
Milly tiptoed into her grandmoth-* 
er’s room. When she heard Dr. 
Schwartz trailing her curiously, 
she turned to him, whispering: 
“I’ll watch over the little girl. You 
go down and explain to that po- 
liceman that there wasn’t any- 

74 



thing harmful in the chemicals in 
the detective set, and there was a 
short circuit in the doorbell, and 
that the child must be allergic 
to the dress. It was all Harts- 
horne-Logan’s fault, not this fam- 
ily’s.” 

“But what about that thing?” 
Dr. Schwartz said, pointing to the 
manky. 

Milly tried frantically to think 
of a believable explanation and 
changed the subject: “The po- 
liceman said something about a 
murder confession. There was 
genuine truthtalk in the detective 
set. If someone swallowed any of 
it, it might be a genuine confes- 
sion.” 

“My goodness!” Dr. Schwartz 
raced downstairs. 

Milly bent over the child who 
would become her grandmother. 
Sally lay flushed and feverish on 
the big bed, sunk into a deep 
coma. Milly bent and kissed her 
grandmother, then quickly deac- 
tivated the anti-grav pads in the 
shoulders. After that, it took only 
a moment to decamouflage the 
zippers which held the crosh 
force. The dress then slipped right 
off. 

Sally sighed the instant the 
dress fell free. Her skin was al- 
ready returning to its normal hue 
by the time Milly had taken an- 
other dress from a bureau drawer. 
Milly slipped it onto Sally and 
covered her up to prevent a chill.

Milly kissed the child again 
and looked at the ancestor whom 
she had known only as a tiny old 
lady. Then she gathered up her 
pile of merchandise, tossing on 
top the dress, with its shoulder 
pads again activated. 

The commotion downstairs was 
still loud, but it no longer sound- 
ed hysterical. Milly ticked off 
the order list on her fingers, to 
make sure she had collected 
everything. Then she opened the 
bedroom window. Buoyed by the 
anti-grav force, she floated to the 
ground, landing with only a slight 
jar. 

She darted through the back- 
yard, away from the house, at- 
tracting no attention. Everyone 
in the block had convened at the 
front of the house, where Mrs. 
Burnett was screaming out a full 
confession and the policeman was 
sweatingly scribbling it down. 

Mrs. Burnett was explaining in 
trying detail the exact manner in 
which she had poisoned her four 
husbands in the past seven years, 
to collect their insurance. 

VL^HEN Milly returned to 
” Hartshorne-Logan of the fu- 
ture, she sank wearily into a chair. 
She held her hand out and 
watched it quiver. 

“Golly, I didn’t realize how 
scared I was, until I got back,” 
she told Mr. Hawkins. “But I 



think I did only one thing wrong. 
I forgot to figure out some alibi 
for my great-uncle to use for his 
accident with the clothes penetra- 
tion ray.” 

“Your ancestors will forget all 
about that in their excitement 
over the insurance company re- 
wards,” Mr. Hawkins assured her. 
“I checked way back on the old 
records. I see that your great- 
grandmother paid her bill, right 
after the date when all this trou- 
ble came up. But she never 
bought another thing from Harts- 
horne-Logan.” 

“Well, it’s a good thing that 
time travel can’t cause trouble 
both ways,” Milly reflected. “I 
don’t think I’ll even go to next 
year’s Christmas party.” 

“No danger of time travel 
bothering us. Nothing could come 
from the past into the present that 
could possibly hurt us.” 

“Gee, I’m glad,” Milly said, and 
sneezed. It frightened her be- 
cause sneezes were unknown in 
this world from which the cold 
virus had been eradicated. Then 
she sneezed again. 

A little later, Mr. Hawkins be- 
gan to sneeze. 

Three billion sniffling, cough- 
ing, nose-blowing persons through- 
out the world were soon proof 
that Mr. Hawkins had blundered 
again.

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



H ERMAN came into the 
office beating his hands 
together and shivering 
with cold. 

“Women!” he said. “Five gal- 
lons, a pint of oil and would I 
check the tires and battery.” He 
snorted. “Tires I don’t mind, but 
couldn’t she have left the battery 
until daylight?” 

“Service,” said Onslow. “Service 
with a smile. Tip?” 

“Not on your life.” Herman 



held out his hands to the warmth 
of the stove. Together with Ons- 
low, he formed the night staff of 
the Acme Garage. It was a pleas- 
ant enough job, with little to do 
in the small hours but sit in the 
office and wait for some stranded 
motorist to call for help or service 
the few cars traveling through the 
night. He nodded toward the pa- 
per Onslow was holding. 

“Anything interesting?” 

“Not much. A couple of hold-

ups, a murder and some more dis- 
appearances.” Onslow riffled the 
paper, his thin face adorned with 
heavy spectacles intent as he read 
the column. “You ever think 
about that?” 

“Holdups?” Warmed, Herman 
sat down and lit a cigarette. Phys- 
ically, he was totally opposite 
Onslow, being big and florid where 
the other man was thin and pale. 
He gestured with his cigarette. 
“Places like this don’t get held 
up, not with the two of us. Those 
punks pick single-man stations to 
knock over.” 

“Not holdups,” said Onslow. 
“Disappearances.” He folded the 
paper and leaned forward. “Did 
you know that every year 12,000 
people vanish? I don’t mean they 
run away from their families or 
skip their jobs. They literally van- 
ish.” He snapped his fingers. “Just 
like that.” 

“Must have a reason,” Herman 
said comfortably. He wasn’t much 
of a reader and was tired of the 
radio, so an argument with Ons- 
low was as good a way to pass the 
time as any he could think of. 
Made something interesting to 
tell Mary over breakfast, too. 

“No reason,” said Onslow. “No 
reason at all.” 

i”'|NSLOW warmed to his sub- 
ject. “You wouldn’t think it 
possible in this civilization, what 
with social security, the police, the 



paper-work checking and register- 
ing every individual, but it does. 
Men and women vanish and are 
never found again. It’s the truth.” 
“I don’t doubt it,” chuckled 
Herman. “There have been times 
when I’ve felt like taking a long, 
one-way walk. Means nothing.” 
“You don’t get it,” said Ons- 
low. “I’m not talking about the 
people who have obviously de- 
cided to run away. People like 
that pack a bag, draw out their 
money from the bank, make some 
preparations before leaving. Most 
of them are easily found; all of 
them could be if anyone were in- 
terested enough. I’m talking about 
the mysteries, the people who 
vanish for no reason and without 
making any plans at all.” He 
shook his head. “Sometimes it 
worries me.” 

“Maybe they were snapped up 
by something in a flying saucer?” 
Herman chuckled again; some- 
how, he couldn’t take Onslow’s 
statement seriously. He didn’t dis- 
believe it, for the thin man never 
lied, but he just couldn’t accept 
it. He changed the subject. “I’ve 
been thinking about what you 
told me last night. You know, that 
time-travel thing.” 

“The paradox?” Onslow smiled. 
“Did you work it out?” 

“I think so.” Herman frowned 
to stir up his memory; he and 
Mary had spent a couple of hours 
on the problem before he hit the

sack. '“If a man invents a time 
machine,” he said carefully, “and 
then goes back to kill his grand- 
father when a boy, then he 
couldn’t have been bom, could 
he?” 

“Hardly.” 

“Then if he hadn’t been born, 
he couldn’t invent a time machine 
in the first place. But if he hadn’t 
invented it, he couldn’t have killed 
his grandfather, so he would have 
been born anyway.” Herman drew 
a deep breath. “So he didn’t kill 
his grandfather at all. Right?” He 
looked anxiously at the other 
man. 

“Near enough.” Onslow knew 
better than to labor the point. “If 
he was born, then his grandfather 
couldn’t have been killed when a 
boy, so all that about going back 
and killing the old man doesn’t 
really enter into it.” 

“That’s what I said,” lied Her- 
man. “Mary kept trying to tie me 
in knots, but I made her see sense 
in the end.” He hesitated. “Got 
any more?” 

“Paradoxes?” Onslow looked 
surprised. “Sure, if you’re inter- 
ested.” 

“I’m interested.” Herman 
glanced through the office win- 
dows. The night was a bad one, 
cold, wet, miserable, a night most 
people would choose to stay in- 
doors. “May as well talk as read 
or listen to the radio. More inter- 
esting, anyway.” 



“How about this one?” Onslow 
helped himself to a cigarette and 
hunched closer to the stove. “An 
old Greek named Zeno dreamed 
it up and it’s a good one. Achilles 
was going to race a tortoise. The 
tortoise was placed halfway down 
a measured strip — it doesn’t mat- 
ter how long — and Achilles stood 
at the starting line. You got the 
idea?” 

“Sure, the tortoise was given a 
big start.” 

“It was halfway down the 
strip,” said Onslow. “So the gun 
went off and the race started. 
Now before Achilles could catch 
up with the tortoise, he had to 
cover half the distance between 
them. Right?” 

IT ERMAN frowned, then 
nodded. “Sure, of course. He 
had to reach the halfway mark 
between them.” 

“Yes, but by the time he had 
reached that halfway mark, the 
tortoise had moved on a bit fur- 
ther. So Achilles had to cover 
half that distance, by which time 
the tortoise had moved on still 
more. So Achilles had to cover 
half that distance and then half 
the next distance and so on.” Ons- 
low leaned back. “How did Achil- 
les ever catch up with the tor- 
toise?” 

“Uh?” Herman looked blank. 
“By running faster, of course. 
Nothing to it.” 



YOU GO 



79 



“Isn’t there?” Onslow reached 
for paper and pencil. “Look at it 
this way.” He made swift sketches. 
“First he had to cover half the 
first distance, then half the sec- 
ond, then the third and all the 
rest. Look at it that way and he 
could never have caught up be- 
cause, no matter how short the 
distance, he had always to cover 
a half of it, by which time the 
tortoise had moved on.” 

“I see,” said Herman glumly. 
This was one time when he 
couldn’t dazzle Mary with his su- 
perior knowledge. It wasn’t much 
good taking home a problem to 
which he didn’t know the answer. 

Onslow took pity on him. “No 
one can really work it out the 
way it’s stated. They say that 
calculus can do it, but I wouldn’t 
know. The easy answer is that 
Achilles wasn’t racing to catch 
up with the tortoise at all; he was 
running to a point past the finish- 
ing line. That way, all he had to 
do was cover a series of decreas- 
ing halves of distance and so, nat- 
urally, he won hands down.” 
“Sure,” said Herman, relieved. 
“The gimmick depends on which 
way you look at it.” 

He glanced at his watch, then 
through the windows. A car came 
down the road, slowed and swung 
into the forecourt of the all-night 
restaurant a few hundred feet 
lower down. Onslow, who had 
headed toward the door when he 

80 



heard the slowing car, grunted 
and busied himself at the stove 
instead. 

Herman switched on the radio, 
listened to a disc jockey announc- 
ing the next record, then switched 
off with a grunt of disgust. “Got 
any more?” 

“Paradoxes?” Onslow looked 
thoughtful. “Have you heard the 
one about the missing unit?” 

“Tell me,” Herman invited. 

“Three men go into a restau- 
rant,” said Onslow. “The bill 
comes to thirty units and — ” 

“Units?” 

“Dollars, pounds, francs, it 
doesn’t matter what you call 
them.” 

O NSLOW lit a fresh cigarette. 

“The bill comes to thirty 
units — dollars, say. The manager, 
after the bill has been paid, finds 
that he’s overcharged by five dol- 
lars. He gives the five dollars to 
a waiter who, being dishonest, 
gives each of the three men one 
dollar each and pockets the re- 
maining two.” Onslow flicked his 
cigarette. “Now, in effect, the men 
have each paid nine dollars for 
their meal. Three nines are twen- 
ty-seven. The waiter has kept two 
dollars. Twenty-seven and two 
make twenty-nine. Where is the 
other dollar?” 

“Wait a minute!” Herman was 
frowning. His lips moved as he 
thought. “What’s the answer?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I don’t know.” Onslow sat 
down and leaned forward. “If you 
take the units — dollars — at each 
stage, you get the full amount. 
They handed the manager thirty 
dollars. He kept twenty-five and 
gave the waiter five, still thirty. 
The waiter gave the men one 
each, three, kept two, five, and 
the manager had the other twenty- 
five. Still thirty. But the men 
went into the restaurant with 
thirty dollars, ten each. They 
come out with one dollar each, 
so they must have spent twenty- 
seven between them. If they 
guessed the waiter was robbing 
them, all they could reclaim was 
two. So we still get twenty-nine 
instead of thirty.” 

He stood up as a car swished 
into the forecourt before the 
pumps. “You think about it while 
I serve this customer,” he sug- 
gested. 

The car was new and the cus- 
tomer felt toward it the same 
emotion that a mother has for 
her child. He insisted on Ons- 
low’s inspecting the oil, demanded 
a different brand from a sealed 
can, watched the pump gauge 
with a suspicious eye, asked to 
have his tires and battery checked 
and then wanted his plugs tested. 
By the time Onslow had finished, 
he was blue with cold and in a 
frame of mind to regret the pass- 
ing of the horse as a means of lo- 
comotion. Herman glanced up 



from where he sat, a sheet of 
paper before him and a frown 
creasing his forehead. 

“I don’t get it,” he said plain- 
tively. 

“Nor me.” Onslow shivered as 
he warmed himself at the stove. 
“You’d think that a guy had better 
things to worry about than a heap 
of steel and rubber.” He rubbed 
his hands together. “Plug testing 
at three A.M.! They’ll be wanting 
a wash and polish next!” 

“Service,” said Herman mali- 
ciously. “Service with a smile. 
Tip?” 

“Go to hell.” 

“It’s warm there, from what 
they tell me,” said Herman mildly. 
He scowled down at his sheet of 
paper. “I’ve been working on what 
you said. I still can’t see it. If 
you count in the money the men 
have, then you get two dollars 
over; if not, one dollar less.” 

“Twenty-seven they paid, three 
they have, two the waiter has.” 
Onslow nodded. “Thirty-two units 
instead of thirty. I told you it was 
a good one.” 

TJ ERMAN blinked. He was an- 
noyed at his inability to 
solve the problem, a little tired 
and more than a little irritated. 
“Why use units? Why not plain, 
ordinary dollars?” 

“It would work in any cur- 
rency,” said Onslow mildly. “The 
paradox, I mean. Or with any- 



Y O U GO 



81 



thing similar. People, for exam- 
ple.” 

“People!” Herman crumpled 
the sheet of paper. “You serious?” 
For answer, Onslow picked up 
his newspaper and opened it at 
the column dealing with the latest 
disappearances. He tapped it. 

“Why not? People are units 
just the same as the mythical 
dollars we were talking about. If 
you can lose a dollar by passing 
it from hand to hand, why not a 
man or a woman?” 

“Hand to hand,” said Herman 
shrewdly. “You don’t pass people 
around that way.” 

“Maybe not, but they move 
just the same.” Onslow listened to 
the hum of an approaching car. 
It mounted, reached a peak, fell 
away as the car drove into the 
night. “People are on the move all 
the time, driving, walking, on the 
subways, in trains, airplanes, 
boats, all the time moving from 
one place to another.” He picked 
up the newspaper and glanced at 
it. “Just like the dollars in the 
paradox.” 

“You’re crazy!” Herman snorted. 
“It isn’t the same at all.” 

“No?” Onslow shrugged. “Call 
a dollar a unit and call a man a 
unit and you have the same thing. 
Pass them around, one way and 
another, and they are still the 
same thing. And if a dollar can 
get lost in the shuffle, then why 
not a man?” 

82 



“Men don’t vanish like that,” 
protested Herman. He flinched as 
Onslow held out the newspaper. 
“They can’t.” 

“But they do.” The thin man 
smiled and produced his ciga- 
rettes. He passed them to Her- 
man, lit them, inhaled with quiet 
luxury. “I used to work in a lost 
and found office one time. You 
wouldn’t believe the things peo- 
ple lose. Umbrellas, briefcases, 
parcels, books, all kinds of things.” 
“I‘ve lost stuff myself,” said 
Herman. “Anyone can forget a 
parcel or a book.” 

“Sure, but that isn’t all.” Ons- 
low stared through the office win- 
dow. “What about false teeth, ar- 
tificial legs, artificial eyes, a pair 
of crutches, trusses, things like 
that? How can a man lose his 
false teeth? They aren’t some- 
thing you carry around in your 
hand or loose in a pocket. The 
same with artificial legs or eyes. 
And not wrapped, remember — 
we used to get them handed in 
just as they were found.” He 
looked at Herman. “Have you 
ever seen a man walking around 
with an unwrapped artificial leg 
under his arm?” 

“Not that I can remember.” 
“Of course you haven’t. And 
teeth — you wear false teeth, Her- 
man. What do you do with 
them?” 

“Keep them in my mouth. 
What else?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“That’s what I mean. And yet 
you’d be surprised at the number 
of dentures handed in to every 
lost and found office every week.” 
Onslow shook his head. “It makes 
you wonder.” 

“Not me, it doesn’t,” said Her- 
man. “I don’t go for that sort of 
pipe-dream.” 

'IN SLOW thoughtfully turned 

■ ' back to the window and blew 
smoke against his reflection. 
“Twelve thousand a year. And 
that’s just in this country alone. 
No one knows how many people 
vanish all over the world. And 
people moving all the time. From 
one place to another and back 
again. From country to country, 
state to state, town to town, even 
from home to business. All mov- 
ing just like the dollars in the 
paradox.” 

Herman didn’t answer. He was 
thinking of Mary’s younger 
brother, who had gone to Korea. 
He’d been reported missing — not 
killed, not even believed to have 
been killed, just missing. Herman 
hadn’t thought it odd at the time, 
but now he couldn’t get it out of 
his mind. 

“Maybe they shed their ‘bits’ 
when they vanish,” said Onslow 
reflectively. “A man gets lost in 
the shuffle and his teeth or spec- 
tacles or artificial leg just stays 
behind.” 

“But where do they go?” Her- 



man was still thinking of Korea. 

“Where does the missing dollar 
go?” Onslow shrugged. “No one 
knows where they go. Maybe 
they’re still walking around some- 
where, not knowing who they are. 
Or perhaps they just vanish, be 
as if they never were.” He 
dropped his butt and trod on it. 
“And it could happen at any time. 
You might leave for work and 
never get there, or start for home 
or down the street and never ar- 
rive. You’d have made only one 
move too many or maybe just a 
move in the wrong direction. 
Who knows?” 

“You’re kidding,” said Herman. 
“You made it all up just to pass 
the time, didn’t you?” He was a 
big man and irritated. 

Onslow stared at him, then 
picked up the newspaper. “Sure,” 
he said. “I just made it up.” 
“Take a walk down the street 
and vanish!” Herman shook his 
head. “Crazy! But you made it 
all up, didn’t you?” 

“That’s what I said.” Onslow 
glanced at his watch. “It’s getting 
near dawn. How about coffee?” 
Going down the road to the res- 
taurant was a privilege Herman 
insisted on. Someone had to stand 
by the phone and pumps, so they 
couldn’t both go. Normally he 
was eager for the errand. This 
time, though, he didn’t move. 
“You go,” he said.

r I ''HIS month’s column, though 

devoid of a single fictional 
work, has, I think, considerable 
general appeal. Physical, natural 
and human sciences are all repre- 
sented. It seems to me that to- 
day’s releases, aimed at the lay 
market, are of high interest and 
digestibility. As for instance: 

THE EXPLORATION OF

her von Braun. The Viking Press, 
N. Y., $4.95 

OR the past four years, or 
-*■ since his articles on space 
flight first began appearing in 



Colliers, the “Mars Project” has 
been identified with von Braun, 
even appearing as a book under 
his name. Now he has pooled re- 
sources with our own Willy and 
produced an intellectually stimu- 
lating volume that has the reader 
asking: “Why isn’t this being done 
now?” 

These two gifted men show 
that a space station, the first nec- 
essary step to a Martian voyage,

THE MEN BEHIND THE 
SPACE ROCKETS by Heinz 
Gartmann. David McKay Co., 
Inc., N. Y. $3.95 

G artmann, a well - known 

rocket expert himself, has 
compiled a series of short biogra- 
phies of the men who he feels 
have been most instrumental in 
bringing rocketry to its present 
eminence. 

He starts with Hermann Gan- 
swindt, the fabulous eccentric who 
first applied Newton’s Third Law 
of Motion to theoretical flight in 
airless space and ends with Wern- 
her von Braun, the man respon- 
sible for the development of the

who made reality out of the stuff 
of dreams. 

THE COMPLETE BOOK OF 
SPACE TRAVEL by Albro Gaul. 
The World Publishing Co., Cleve- 
land & N. Y., $4.95 

T WILL not quarrel with Gaul’s 
gall in naming his book. I can 
only admire him for opening 
thus: “The first space pilot has 



already been bom. He is prob- 
ably between ten and sixteen.” 
My ten-year-old, Rickie, agrees 
vehemently. So, you see, Gaul has 
a ready-made market. 

You and I can only stand on 
the sidelines while he cautions his 
neo-spacemen concerning the 
problems they are certain to en- 
counter. The book’s chapters are 
well thought out and have the 
advantage of having Virgil Fin- 
lay’s unbelievably detailed draw- 
ings to enhance interest. 

The completely straight-faced 
instructions for deportment upon 
encountering alien intelligence 
are priceless. Maybe it’s rinuch 
later than we think. 

THEY KNEW TOO MUCH 
ABOUT FLYING SAUCERS by 
Gray Barker. University Books, 
N. Y. $3.50 

MINISTER as the title is, my 
^ own hunch is that Gray 
Barker is due for a long life, his 
dangerous knowledge notwith- 
standing. His book is a weird 
winding trail of saucer reports 
which he tracked down to the 
neglect of his business, and the 
peculiar and sudden loss of in- 
terest in saucers by prominent in- 
vestigators and devotees. 

He may be right, but there is 
another explanation he omitted — 
downright boredom. I know I’m 
tired of saucers!

THE COAST OF CORAL by 
Arthur C. Clarke. Harper 8s 
Brothers, N. Y., $5.00 

CINCE the invention of the 
^ aqualung, there has been an 
upswing in interest in the sea. The 
trend is exemplified when such a 
man as Clarke, with his reputa- 
tion earned in other fields, sticks 
his nose into a mask and swims 
off to investigate the underwater 
beauties of the Great Barrier 
Reef, off Australia. 

Throughout the book, I couldn’t 
help but feel that Clarke was 
purpling a lily. The subject is dra- 
matic in itself and he appeared to 
be straining for vividness except 
during his underwater descrip- 
tions. But nobody can carp at the 
glorious photos, both black and 
white and color. 

EARTH, SKY AND SEA, by 
Auguste Piccard. Oxford Univer- 
sity Press, N. Y., $4.00 

PROFESSOR PICCARD has 

always exemplified the spirit 
of scientific adventure to me since 
his daring balloon ascents in the 
’30s. Add to that the fabulous 
records set by his development, 
the bathyscaphe, employing the 
identical principles as the strato- 
spheric balloon in the medium of 
the oceanic abyss, and you can 
see that I was panting to rip into 
this tome. 



Interesting, yes, but it is too 
full of acknowledgments of aid 
from various agencies and manu- 
facturing firms and has too much 
technical detail for the lay reader 
in search of adventure at the 
frontiers of science.

"OIERCE is no stranger to sci-

SYNOPSIS 



I N THE freak “jaunte-age” 
25th century of teleporta- 
tion, Gully Foyle, a common 
spaceman marooned in space 
aboard the wrecked freighter SS 
Nomad, has been galvanized into 
ferocity by the unaccountable re- 
fusal of a sister ship, SS Vorga, to 
rescue him. Foyle succeeds in res- 
cuing himself and returns from 
space devoured by a desire for 
vengeance against Vorga. He has 
returned hideously tattooed after 
a stay with a savage tribe who 
live on a Sargasso planetoid in 
the Asteroid Belt. They have sal- 
vaged the Nomad and built it into 
their little planet. 

Foyle’s first primitive attempt 
at vengeance forces him to black- 
mail and assault a lovely Negro 
girl named Robin Wednesbury, 
who is a jaunte teacher and a 
“telesend,” a one-way telepath. 
Foyle is captured by the owner 
of Vorga and Nomad, the famous 
Presteign of Presteign, who is de- 
termined to discover the location 
of the wreck of the Nomad. On 
board the ship is Cr 20 millions in 
platinum and a mysterious sub- 
stance called PyrE. Central Intel- 
ligence, represented by Captain 
Peter Y’ang-Yeovil, is also anx- 
ious to locate the priceless PyrE, 
which may be the vital factor in 
the war between the Inner Plan- 
ets and the Outer Satellites.

Gottfire Martel, Foyle is able to 
make contact with another pris- 
oner, Jisbella McQueen, over the 
“Whisper Line,” an acoustical 
ireak which enables them to whis- 
per to each other even though 
their cells are half a mile apart. 
Jiz McQueen, a rebel against 
jaunte-age morality which keeps 
women in purdah, is a clever, edu- 
cated girl imprisoned for larceny. 
She educates Foyle, teaches him 
to speak properly, and plans to 
escape with him. Jiz explains to 
Foyle that if he is to revenge him- 
self on Vorga, he cannot punish 
the ship itself; he must find the 
man who gave the order to leave 
him in space. 

Foyle and Jiz make a daring 
escape from Gouffre Martel and 
Jiz takes Foyle to an underworld 
physician who removes the 
ghastly tattooing from Foyle’s 
face. Then Foyle and Jiz jet out 
to the Sargasso Asteroid to sal- 
vage the Cr 20 millions from the 
wreck of the Nomad. Foyle makes 
the terrifying discovery that al- 
though the tattooing has been re- 
moved from his face, the blood- 
red scars of it reappear whenever 
he is overcome by any emotion. 
He will have to maintain iron 
control over himself forever. 

Just as Foyle succeeds in cut- 
ting loose the purser’s safe, con- 
taining the fortune in platinum 
and the PyrE, from the wreck of 
the Nomad, Saul Dagenham jets

up to the asteroid. He has fol- 
lowed Foyle from Terra. Foyle, 
driven by his remorseless lust for 
vengeance, abandons Jiz Mc- 
Queen to Dagenham, sacrificing 
her in order to escape with the 
treasure. 

Months later, Foyle reappears 
on Terra in the guise of Geoffrey 
Fourmyle of Ceres, a ludicrous 
new-rich playboy whose antics 
are the delight and the laughing- 
stock of the world. This is really 
protective camouflage for Foyle, 
who is still intent on revenge. He 
has ferreted out the names of 
three crewmen from the Vorga. 
To track them down, he is pre- 
pared for any emergency, for he 
has studied hard and he has bribed 
a physician from the Commando 
Brigade to operate on him and re- 
wire muscle and nerve to turn 
him into a fantastic accelerated 
fighting machine, capable of in- 
credibly fast and strong acts for 
short periods. 

Foyle’s final step is to make 
Robin Wednesbury, the cultivated 
and lovely Negro “telesend,” 
join forces with him. Foyle re- 
veals to Robin that her mother 
and two sisters, missing since the 
war broke out between the Inner 
Planets and Outer Satellites, are 
in some way connected with SS 
Vorga which he is hunting. Al- 
though Robin was raped by Foyle 
and loathes him, she is forced to 
work with him.

A N New Year’s Eve, Geoffrey 
Fourmyle of Ceres made his 
onslaught .on society. He ap- 
peared first in Canberra at the 
Government House ball, half an 
hour before midnight. This was a 
highly formal affair, bursting with 
color and pageantry, for it was the 
custom at formals for society to 
wear the evening dress that had 
been fashionable the year its clan 
was founded or its trademark 
patented. 

Thus the Morses (Telephone 
and Telegraph) wore 19th-cen- 
tury frock coats and their women 
wore Victorian hoop-skirts. The 
Skodas (Powder 85 Guns) harked 
back to the late 18th century, 
wearing Regency tights and crino- 
lines. The daring Peenemundes 
(Rockets & Reactors), dating 
from the 1920s, wore tuxedos and 
their women unashamedly re- 
vealed legs, arms and necks in 
antique Worth and Mainbocher 
gowns. 

Fourmyle of Ceres appeared in 
evening clothes, very modern and 
very black, relieved only by a 
white sunburst on his shoulder^ 
the trademark of the Ceres clan. 
With him was Robin Wednes- 
bury in a glittering white gown, 
her slender waist tight in whale- 
bone, the bustle of the gown ac- 
centuating her long straight back 
and graceful step. 



The black and white contrast 
was so arresting that an orderly 
was sent to check the sunburst 
trademark in The Almanack ol 
Peerages and Patents. He re- 
turned with the news that it was 
of the Ceres Mining Company, or- 
ganized in 2250 for the exploita- 
tion of the mineral resources of 
Ceres, Pallas and Vesta. The re- 
sources had never manifested 
themselves and the House of 
Ceres had gone into eclipse but 
had never become extinct. Ap- 
parently it was now being revived. 
“Fourmyle? The clown?” 
“Yes. The Four Mile Circus. 
Everybody’s talking about him.” 
“Is that the same man?” 
“Couldn’t be. He looks human.” 
Society moved toward Four- 
myle, curious but wary. 

“Here they come,” Foyle mut- 
tered to Robin. 

“Relax. They’ll accept anything 
if it’s amusing. Stay tuned.” 

“Are you that dreadful man 
with the circus, Fourmyle?” 
“Sure you are. Smile.” 

“I am, madam. You may touch 
me.” 

“Why, you actually seem proud. 
Are you proud of your bad taste?” 
“The problem today is to have 
any taste at all.” 

“The problem today is to have 
any taste at all. I think I’m lucky.” 
“Lucky but dreadfully inde- 
cent.” 

“Indecent but not dull.” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION

“And dreadful but delightful. 
Why aren’t you cavorting now?” 
“I’m under the influence, mad- 
am.” 

“Oh, dear. Are you drunk?” 
“I’m under your influence.” 
“You wicked young man. 
Charles, come here and save 
Fourmyle. I’m ruining him.” 
“That’s Victor of R.C.A. Vic- 
tor.” 

“Fourmyle, is it? Delighted. 
What’s that entourage of yours 
cost?” 

“Tell him the truth.” 

“Forty thousand, Victor.” 
“Good Lord! A week?” 

“A day.” 

k DAY! What on Earth 
d’you want to spend all 
that money for?” 

“The truth again!” 

“For notoriety, Victor.” 

“Ha! Are you serious?” 

“I told you he was wicked, 
Charles.” 

“Damned refreshing. Klaus! 
This impudent young man is 
spending forty thousand a day — 
for notoriety, if you please!” 
“Skoda of Skoda.” 

“Good evening, Fourmyle. I am 
much interested in this revival of 
the name. You are, perhaps, a 
cadet descendant of the original 
founding board of Ceres, Inc.?” 
“Give him the truth.” 

“No, Skoda. It’s a title by pur- 
chase. I bought the company. I’m 



a mere climbing upstart, Skoda.” 
“Good. Tou jours audace!” 

“My word, Fourmyle! You’re 
frank.” 

“Told you he was impudent. 
Very refreshing. There’s a parcel 
of damned upstarts about, young 
man, but they don’t admit it. 
Elizabeth, come and meet Four- 
myle of Ceres.” 

“Fourmyle! I’ve been dying to 
meet you.” 

“Lady Elizabeth Citroen.” 

“Is it true you travel with a 
portable college?” 

“The light touch here.” 

“A portable high school, Lady 
Elizabeth.” 

“But why, Fourmyle?” 

“Oh, madam, it’s so difficult to 
spend money these days. We have 
to find the silliest excuses. If only 
someone would invent a new ex- 
travagance.” 

“You ought to travel with a 
portable inventor, Fourmyle.” 
“I’ve got one. Haven’t I, Robin? 
But he wastes his time on per- 
petual motion. What I need is a 
resident spendthrift. Would any 
of your clans care to lend me a 
younger son?” 

“Would any of us care to? 
There’s many a clan would pay 
for the privilege of unloading.” 
“Isn’t perpetual motion spend- 
thrift enough for you, Fourmyle?” 
“No. It’s a shocking waste of 
money. The whole point of ex- 
travagance is to act like a fool 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and feel like a fool, but enjoy it. 
Where’s the joy in perpetual mo- 
tion? Is there any extravagance 
in entropy? Millions for nonsense, 
but not one cent for entropy. My 
slogan.” 

r 1 1 HEY laughed and the crowd 
clustering around Fourmyle 
grew. They were delighted and 
amused. He was a new toy. Then 
it was midnight, and as the great 
clock tolled in the New Year, the 
gathering prepared to move with 
midnight around the world. 

“Come with us to Java, Four- 
myle. Regis Sheffield’s giving a 
marvelous legal party. We’re go- 
ing to play ‘Sober the Judge.’” 
“Hong Kong, Fourmyle.” 
“Tokyo, Fourmyle. It’s raining 
in Hong Kong. Come to Tokyo 
and bring your circus.” 

“Thank you, no. Shanghai for 
me. The Soviet Duomo. I prom- 
ise an extravagant reward to the 
first one who discovers the decep- 
tion of my costume. Meet you all 
in two hours. Ready, Robin?” 
“Don’t jaunte. Bad manners. 
Walk out. Slowly. Respects to the 
Governor ... to the Commis- 
sioner . their ladies . bien. 
Don’t forget to tip the attendants. 
Not him, idiot! That’s the Lieu- 
tenant Governor. All right, you 
made a hit. You’re accepted. Now 
what?” 

“Now what we came to Can- 
berra for.” 



“I thought we came for the 
ball.” 

“The ball and a man named 
Forrest.” 

“Who’s that?” 

“Ben Forrest, spaceman off the 
Vorga. I’ve got three leads to the 
man who gave the order to let me 
die — a cook in Rome named 
Poggi; a quack in Shanghai 
named Orel; and this man, For- 
rest. This is a combined opera- 
tion . society and search. Un- 
derstand?” 

“I understand.” 

“We’ve got two hours to rip 
Forrest open. D’you know the co- 
ordinates of the Aussie Cannery 
company town?” 

“I don’t want any part of your 
Vorga revenge. I’m searching for 
my family.” 

“This is a combined operation 
— every way,” he said with such 
detached savagery that she winced 
and at once jaunted. When Foyle 
arrived in his tent in the Four 
Mile Circus on Jervis Beach, she 
"was already changing into travel 
clothes. Foyle looked at her. Al- 
though he forced her to live in his 
tent for security reasons, he had 
never touched her again. Robin 
caught his glance, stopped chang- 
ing and waited. 

He shook his head. “That’s all 
finished.” 

“How interesting. You’ve given 
up rape?” 

“Get dressed,” he said, control-

ling himself. “Tell them they’ve 
got two hours to get the camp up 
to Shanghai.” 

TT .WAS twelve-thirty when 
Foyle and Robin arrived at 
the front office of the Aussie Can- 
nery company town. They ap- 
plied for identification tags and 
were greeted by the mayor him- 
self. 

“Happy New Year,” the mayor 
caroled. “Happy! Happy! Happy! 
Visiting? A pleasure to drive you 
around. Permit me.” He bundled 
them into a lush helicopter and 
took off. “Lots of visitors tonight. 
Ours is a friendly town. Friend- 
liest company town in the world.” 
The plane circled giant buildings. 
“That’s our ice palace. Swimming 
baths on the left. Big dome is the 
ski-jump. Snow all year round. 
Tropical gardens under that glass 
roof. Palms, parrots, orchids, fruit. 
There’s our market . theater 
. got our own broadcasting 
company, too. 3D-5S. Take a look 
at the football stadium. Two of 
our boys made All-American this 
year. Turner at Right Rockne 
and Otis at Left Thorpe.” 

“Do tell,” Foyle murmured. 

“Yessir, we’ve got everything. 
Everything. You don’t have to 
jaunte around the world looking 
for fun. Aussie Cannery brings the 
world to you. Our town’s a little 
universe. Happiest little universe 
in the world.” 

94 



“Having absentee problems, I 
see.” 

The mayor refused to falter in 
his sales-pitch. “Look down at the 
streets. See those bikes? Motor- 
cycles? Cars? We can afford more 
luxury transportation per capita 
than any other town on Earth. 
Look at those homes. Mansions. 
Our people are rich and happy. 
We keep ’em rich and happy.” 

“But do you keep them?” 

“What d’you mean? Of course 
we — ” 

“You can tell us the truth. 
We’re not job prospects. Do you 
keep them?” 

“We can’t keep ’em more than 
six months,” the mayor groaned. 
“It’s a hell of a headache. We 
give ’em everything, but we can’t 
hold onto ’em. They get the wan- 
derlust and jaunte. Absenteeism’s 
cut our production by twelve per 
cent. We can’t hold onto steady 
labor.” 

“Nobody can.” 

“There ought to be a law. For- 
rest, you said? Right here.” 

He landed them before a Swiss 
chalet set in an acre of gardens 
and took off, grumbling to him- 
self. Foyle and Robin stepped be- 
fore the door of the house, wait- 
ing for the monitor to pick them 
up and announce them. Instead, 
the door flashed red and a white 
skull and crossbones appeared on 
it. A canned voice spoke: “warn- 
ing. THIS RESIDENCE IS MAN- 
GA l A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



TRAPPED BY THE LETHAL DEFENSE 
CORPORATION OF SWEDEN. R:77- 
23. YOU HAVE BEEN LEGALLY NO- 
TIFIED.” 

“On New Year’s Eve?” Foyle 
said to Robin. “Friendly fella. 
Let’s try the back.” 

They walked around the chalet, 
pursued by the skull and cross- 
bones flashing at intervals, and 
the canned warning. At one side, 
they saw the top of a cellar win- 
dow brightly illuminated and 
heard the muffled chant of voices : 
“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall 
not want.” 

“Cellar-Christians!” Foyle ex- 
claimed. 

TT E AND Robin peered through 
the window. Thirty worship- 
ers of assorted faiths were cele- 
brating the New Year with a 
combined and highly illegal serv- 
ice. The 25th century had not yet 
abolished God, but it had abol- 
ished organized religion. 

“No wonder the house is man- 
trapped,” Foyle said. “Filthy prac- 
tices like that. Look, they’ve got 
a priest and a rabbi, and that 
thing behind them is a crucifix.” 

“Did you ever stop to think 
what swearing is?” Robin asked 
quietly. “You say ‘Jesus’ and 
‘Jesus Christ.’ Do you know what 
that is?” 

“Just swearing, that’s all. Like 
‘ouch’ or ‘damn.’ ” 

“No, it’s religion. You don’t 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



know it, but there are two thou- 
sand years of meaning behind 
words like that.” 

“This is no time for dirty talk,” 
Foyle said impatiently. “Save it 
for later. Come on.” 

The rear of the chalet was a 
solid wall of glass, the picture 
window of a dimly lit, empty liv- 
ing room. 

“Down on your face,” Foyle or- 
dered. “I’m going in.” 

Robin lay prone on the marble 
patio. Foyle triggered his body, 
accelerated into a lightning blur 
and smashed a hole in the glass 
wall. Far down on the sound spec- 
trum, he heard dull concussions. 
They were shots. Quick projec- 
tiles laced toward him. Foyle 
dropped to the floor and tuned 
his ears, sweeping from low bass 
to supersonic until at last he 
picked up the hum of the Man- 
Trap control mechanism. He 
turned his head gently, pin- 
pointed the location by binaural 
D/F, wove in. through the stream 
of shots and demolished the 
mechanism. He decelerated. 
“Come in, quick!” 

Robin joined him in the living 
room, trembling. The Cellar-Chris- 
tians were pouring up into the 
house somewhere, emitting the 
sounds of martyrs. 

“Wait here,” Foyle grunted. He 
accelerated, blurred through the 
house, located the Cellar-Chris- 
tians in poses of frozen flight, and 



95 



sorted through them. He returned 
to Robin and decelerated. 

“None of them is Forrest,” he 
reported. “Maybe he’s upstairs. 
The back way, while they’re go- 
ing out the front. Come on!” 

They raced up the back stairs. 
On the landing they paused to 
take bearings. 

“Have to work fast,” Foyle said. 
“Between the shots and the reli- 
gion riot, the world and his wife’ll 
be jaunting around asking ques- 
tions — ” He broke off. A low 
mewling sound came from a door 
at the head of the stairs. Foyle 
sniffed. 

“Analogue!” he exclaimed. 
“Must be Forrest. How about 
that? Religion in the cellar and 
dope upstairs.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“I’ll explain later. In here. I 
only hope he isn’t on a gorilla 
kick.” 

t'OYLE went through the door 

like a diesel tractor. They were 
in a large, bare room. A heavy 
rope was suspended from the ceil- 
ing. A naked man was entwined 
with the rope midway in the air. 
He squirmed and slithered up and 
down the rope, emitting a mewl- 
ing sound and a musky odor. 

“Python,” Foyle said. “That’s a 
break. Don’t go near him. He’ll 
mash your bones if he touches 
you.” 

Voices below began to call: 



“Forrest! What’s all the shoot- 
ing? Happy New Year, Forrest! 
Where in hell’s the celebration?” 

“Here they come,” Foyle 
grunted. “Have to jaunte him out 
of here. Meet you back at the 
beach. Go!” 

He whipped a knife out of his 
pocket, cut the rope, swung the 
squirming man onto his back and 
jaunted. Robin was on the empty 
Jervis beach a moment before 
him. Foyle arrived with the 
squirming man oozing over his 
neck and shoulders like a python, 
crushing him in a terrifying em- 
brace. The red stigmata had burst 
out on Foyle’s face. 

“Sinbad,” he said in a stran- 
gled voice. “Old Man of the Sea. 
Quick, girl! Right pockets. Three 
over. Two down. Sting-ampule. 
Let him have it anywh— ” His 
voice was choked off. 

Robin opened the pocket, found 
a packet of glass beads and took 
them out. Each bead had a bee- 
sting end. She thrust the sting of 
an ampule into the writhing man’s 
neck. He collapsed. Foyle shook 
him off and arose from the sand. 

“Christ!” He massaged his 
throat and took a deep breath. 
“Control,” he said, resuming his 
air of detached calm. The scarlet 
tattooing faded from his face. 

“What was all that horror?” 
Robin asked. 

“Analogue. Psychiatric dope for 
psychotics. Illegal. A twitch has 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to release himself somehow, re- 
vert to the primitive. He identifies 
with a particular kind of animal — 
gorilla, grizzly, brood bull, wolf. 
Takes the dope and turns into the 
animal he admires. Forrest was 
queer for snakes, seems as if.” 
“How do you know all this?” 
“Told you I’ve been preparing 
for Vorga. Show you something 
else I’ve learned, if you’re not 
chicken-livered — how to bring a 
twitch out of Analogue.” 

Foyle opened another pocket in 
his battle coveralls and got to 
work on Forrest. Robin watched 
for a moment, then uttered a hor- 
rified cry, turned and walked to 
the edge of the water. She stood, 
staring blindly at the surf and the 
stars, until the mewling and the 
twisting ceased and Foyle called 
to her. 

“You can come back now.” 

D OBIN returned to find a shat- 
-*-*• tered creature seated upright 
on the beach gazing at Foyle with 
dull, sober eyes. 

“You’re Forrest?” 

“Who the hell are you?” 
“You’re Ben Forrest, leading 
spaceman. Formerly aboard the 
Presteign Vorga.” 

Forrest cried out in terror. 
“You were aboard the Vorga 
on September 16th, 2436.” 

The man sobbed and shook his 
head. 

“On September sixteen, you 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



passed a wreck out near the As- 
teroid Belt. Wreck of the Nomad, 
your sister ship. She signaled for 
help. Vorga passed her by. Left 
her to drift and die. Why did 
Vorga pass her by?” 

Forrest began to scream hys- 
terically. 

“The records are all gone from 
the Bo’ness & Uig files. Someone 
got to them before me. Who was 
that? Who was aboard Vorga? 
Who shipped with you? I want 
officers and crew. Who was in 
command?” 

“No!” 

Foyle held a sheaf of bank- 
notes before the hysterical man’s 
face. “I’ll pay for the information. 
Fifty thousand. Analogue for the 
rest of your life. Who gave the 
order to let me die, Forrest? 
Who?” 

The man smote the banknotes 
from Foyle’s hand, leaped up and 
ran down the beach. Foyle tackled 
him at the edge of the surf. For- 
rest fell headlong, his face in the 
water. Foyle held him there. 

“Who commanded Vorga, For- 
rest? Who gave the order?” 

“You’re drowning him!” Robin 
cried. 

“Water’s easier than vacuum. I 
suffered for six months. Who gave 
the order, Forrest?” 

The man bubbled and choked. 
Foyle lifted his head out of the 
water. “What are you? Loyal? 
Crazy? Scared? Your kind would 

97 



sell out for five thousand. I’m of- 
fering fifty. Fifty thousand for in- 
formation, you son of a bitch, or 
you die slow and hard.” 

The tattooing appeared on 
Foyle’s face. He forced Forrest’s 
head back into the water and held 
the struggling man. 

Robin tried to pull him off. 
“You’re murdering him!” . 

Foyle turned his terrifying face 
on Robin. “Get your hands off 
me! Who was aboard with you, 
Forrest? Who gave the order? 
Why?” 

Forrest twisted his head out of 
the water. “Twelve of us on 
Vorga,” he screamed. “Christ save 
me! There was me and Kemp—” 

TIE JERKED spasmodically 
and sagged. Foyle pulled his 
body out of the surf. 

“Go on. You and who? Kemp? 
Who else? Talk.” 

There was no response. Foyle 
examined the body. 

“Dead,” he growled. 

“Oh, my God! My God!” 

“Just when he was opening up. 
What a stinking break.” He took 
a deep breath and drew calm 
about him like an iron cloak. The 
tattooing disappeared from his 
face. He adjusted his watch for 
120 degrees east longitude. “Al- 
most midnight in Shanghai. Let’s 
go. Maybe we’ll have better luck 
with Sergei Orel, pharmacist’s 
mate off the Vorga. Don’t look so 



scared. This is only the begin- 
ning. Go, girl. Jaunte!” 

Robin gasped. He saw that she 
was staring over his shoulder with 
an expression of incredulity. Foyle 
turned. A flaming figure loomed 
on the beach, a huge man with 
burning clothes and a monstrously 
tattooed face. 

“Christ!” Foyle took a step to- 
ward the burning image, and ab- 
ruptly it was gone. He turned to 
Robin, ashen and trembling. “Did 
you see that?” 

“Yes.” 

“What was it?” 

“You.” 

“Me? How’s that possible? 
How 

“It was you.” 

“But—” He faltered, the strength 
and furious possession drained 
out of him. “Illusion? Hallucina- 
tion?” 

“I don’t know. I saw it, too.” 

“To see yourself . face to 
face. The clothes were on fire. Did 
you see that? What in the name 
of God was it?” 

“It was Gully Foyle,” Robin 
said, “burning in hell.” 

“All right,” he burst out angrily. 
“It was me in hell, but I’m going 
through with it. If I burn in hell, 
Vorga will burn with me.” He 
pounded his palms together, sting- 
ing himself back to strength and 
purpose. “I’m still going through 
with it, by God! Shanghai next. 
Jaunte!”

A T the costume ball in Shang- 
hai, Fourmyle of Ceres elec- 
trified society by appearing as 
Death in Diirer’s “Death and the 
Maiden” with a dazzling blonde 
creature clad in transparent veils. 
A Victorian society which stifled 
its women in purdah, and which 
regarded the 1920 gowns of the 
Peenemunde clan as excessively 
daring, was shocked, despite the 
fact that Robin Wednesbury was 
chaperoning the pair. But when 
Fourmyle revealed that the fe- 
male was a magnificent android, 
there was an instant reversal of 
opinion in his favor. Society was 
delighted with the deception. 
Nakedness, shameful in humans, 
was merely a sexless curiosity in 
androids. 

At midnight, Fourmyle auc- 
tioned off the android to the gen- 
tlemen of the ball. 

“The money to go to charity, 
Fourmyle?” 

“Certainly not. You know my 
slogan: Not one cent for entropy. 
Do I hear a hundred credits for 
this expensive and lovely crea- 
ture? She’s all beauty and highly 
adaptable. Two hundred? Thank 
you. Three and a half? Thank 
you. I’m bid — Five? Eight? 
Thank you. Any more bids for 
this remarkable product of the 
resident genius of the Four Mile 
Circus? She walks. She talks. She 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



adapts. She has been conditioned 
to respond to the highest bidder. 
Nine? Do I hear any more bids? 
Are you all done? All through? 
Sold to Lord Yale for nine hun- 
dred credits.” 

Tumultuous applause and ap- 
palled ciphering: “An android 

like that must have cost ninety 
thousand! How can he afford it?” 

“Will you turn the money over 
to the android, Lord Yale? She 
will respond suitably. Until we 
meet again in Rome, ladies and 
gentlemen . the Borghese Pal- 
ace at midnight. Happy New 
Year.” 

Fourmyle had already departed 
when Lord Yale discovered, to 
the delight of himself and the 
other bachelors, that a double de- 
ception had been perpetrated. 
The android was, in fact, a living, 
human creature, all beauty and 
highly adaptable. She responded 
magnificently to nine hundred 
credits. The trick was the smok- 
ing room story of the year. The 
stags waited eagerly to congratu- 
late Fourmyle. 

But Foyle and Robin Wednes- 
bury were passing under a sign 
that read: double your jaunt- 
ing OR DOUBLE YOUR MONEY 
back in seven languages, and en- 
tering the emporium of dr. ser- 
GEI OREL, CELESTIAL ENLARGER 
OF CRANIAL CAPABILITIES. 

The waiting room was deco- 
rated with lurid brain charts dem- 

99 



onstrating how Dr. Orel poulticed, 
cupped, balsamed and electro- 
lyzed the brain into double its 
capacity or double your money 
back. He also doubled your mem- 
ory with antifebrile purgatives, 
magnified your morals with tonic 
roborants, and adjusted all an- 
guished psyches with Orel’s Epu- 
lotic Vulnerary. 

The waiting room was empty. 
Foyle opened a door at a venture. 
He and Robin had a glimpse of a 
long hospital ward. Foyle grunted 
in disgust. 

“A Snow Joint. Might have 
known he’d be running a dive for 
sick-heads, too.” 

r T' , HIS den catered to Disease 
Collectors, the most hopeless 
of neurotic addicts. They lay in 
their hospital beds, suffering 
mildly from illegally induced 
para-measles, para-flu, para-ma- 
laria, devotedly attended by 
nurses in starched white uniforms, 
and avidly enjoying their illegal 
illness and the attention it 
brought. 

“Look at them,” Foyle said con- 
temptuously. “Disgusting. If 
there’s anything filthier than a re- 
ligion-junky, it’s a disease-bird.” 

“Good evening,” a voice said 
behind them. 

Foyle shut the door and turned. 
Dr. Sergei Orel bowed, crisp and 
sterile in the classic white cap, 
gown and surgical mask of the 

100 



medical clans, to which he be- 
longed by fraudulent assertion 
only. He was short, swarthy and 
olive-eyed, recognizably Russian 
by his name alone. More than a 
century of jaunting had so min- 
gled the many populations of the 
world that racial types were dis- 
appearing. 

“Didn’t expect to find you open 
for business on New Year’s Eve,” 
Foyle said. 

“Our Russian New Year comes 
two weeks later,” Dr. Orel an- 
swered. “Step this way, please.” 
He pointed to a door and disap- 
peared with a pop. The door re- 
vealed a long flight of stairs. As 
Foyle and Robin started up the 
stairs, Dr. Orel appeared above 
them. “This way, please. Oh . 
one moment.” He disappeared 
and appeared again behind them. 
“You forgot to close the door.” He 
shut the door and jaunted again. 
This time he reappeared high at 
the head of the stairs. “In here, 
please.” 

“Showing off,” Foyle muttered. 
“Double your jaunting or double 
your money back. All the same, 
he’s pretty fast. I’ll have to be 
faster.” 

They entered the consultation 
room. It was a glass-roofed pent- 
house. The walls were lined with 
gaudy antiquated medical appa- 
ratus : a sedative bath-machine, 
an electric chair for administering 
shock treatment to schizophrenics, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an EEG analyzer for tracing psy- 
chotic patterns, old optical and 
electronic microscopes. 

The quack waited for them be- 
hind his desk. He jaunted to the 
door, closed it, jaunted back to his 
desk, bowed, indicated chairs, 
jaunted behind Robin’s and held 
it for her, jaunted to the window 
and adjusted the shade, jaunted 
to the light switch and adjusted 
the lights, then reappeared be- 
hind his desk. 

“One year ago,” he smiled, “I 
could not jaunte at all. Then I 
discovered the secret, the Saluti- 
ferous Abstersive which—” 

Foyle touched his tongue to the 
switchboard wired into the nerve- 
endings of his teeth. He acceler- 
ated. He arose without haste, 
stepped to the slow-motion figure 
going “Bloo-hwoo-fwaa-maw” be- 
hind the desk, took out a heavy 
sap and scientifically smote Orel 
across the brow, concussing the 
frontal lobes and stunning the 
jaunte center. He picked the 
quack up and strapped him into 
the electric chair. All this took 
approximately two seconds. To 
Robin Wednesbury, it was a blur 
of motion. 

T^OYLE decelerated. The quack 
opened his eyes, stirred, dis- 
covered where he was, and started 
in anger and perplexity. 

“You’re Sergei Orel, pharma- 
cist’s mate off the Vorga,” Foyle 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



said quietly. “You were aboard 
the Vorga on September 16, 2436.” 
The anger and perplexity 
turned to terror. 

“On September sixteen, you 
passed a wreck out near the As- 
teroid Belt. It was the wreck of 
the Nomad. She signaled for help 
and Vorga passed her by. You 
left her to drift and die. Why?” 
Orel rolled his eyes but did not 
answer. 

“Who gave the order to pass 
me by? Who was willing to let me 
rot and die?” 

Orel began to gibber. 

“Who was aboard Vorga? Who 
shipped with you? Who was in 
command? I’m going to get an 
answer. I’ll buy it or tear it out 
of you. Why was I left to die? 
Who told you to let me die?” 
Orel screamed. “I can’t talk 
abou— Wait! I’ll tell—” 

He sagged. 

Foyle examined the body. 
“Dead, just when he was ready 
to talk, like Forrest.” 

“Murdered.” 

“I never touched him. It was 
suicide.” Foyle guffawed without 
humor. 

“You’re insane.” 

“No, amused. I didn’t kill them; 
I forced them to kill themselves.” 
“What nonsense is this?” 
“They’ve been given Sympa- 
thetic Blocks. You know about 
SBs, girl? Intelligence uses them 
on espionage agents. Take a cer- 

101 



tain body of information you don’t 
want told. Link it with the sym- 
pathetic nervous syitem that con- 
trols automatic respiration and 
heart beat. As soon as the subject 
tries to reveal that information, 
the block comes down, the heart 
and lungs stop, the man dies, your 
secret’s kept. An agent doesn’t 
have to worry about killing him- 
self to avoid torture; it’s been 
done for him.” 

“It was done to these men?” 
she asked. 

“Obviously.” 

“But why?” 

“How do I know? Refugee Run- 
ning isn’t the answer. Vorga must 
have been operating worse rack- 
ets than that to take this precau- 
tion. But we’ve got a problem. 
Our last lead is Poggi in Rome. 
Angelo Poggi, chef’s assistant off 
the Vorga. How are we going to 
get information out of him with- 
out — ” 

He broke off. 

His image stood before him, si- 
lent, ominous, face burning blood- 
red, clothes flaming. 

Foyle was paralyzed. He took 
a breath and spoke in a shaking 
voice. “Who are you? What do 
you — ” 

The image disappeared without 
a sound. 

Foyle turned to Robin, mois- 
tening his lips. “Did you see it?” 
Her expression answered him. 
“Was it real?” 



S HE pointed to Sergei Orel’s 
desk, alongside which the 
image had stood. Papers on the 
desk had caught fire and were 
burning briskly. Foyle backed 
away, still frightened and bewil- 
dered. He passed a hand across 
his face. It came away wet. 

Robin rushed to the desk and 
tried to beat out the flames. She 
picked up wads of paper and let- 
ters and slammed helplessly. 
Foyle did not move. 

“I can’t stop it,” she gasped at 
last. “We’ve got to get out of 
here.” 

Foyle nodded, then pulled him- 
self together. “Rome,” he croaked. 
“We jaunte to Rome. There’s got 
to be some explanation for this. 
I’ll find it, by God! And in the 
meantime, I’m not quitting. Rome. 
Go, girl. Jaunte!” 

* * ❖ 

Since the Middle Ages, the 
Spanish Stairs have been the cen- 
ter of corruption in Rome. Rising 
from the Piazza di Spagna to the 
gardens of the Villa Borghese in 
a broad long sweep, the Spanish 
Stairs are, have been, and always 
will be swarming with vice. 

They were destroyed in the 
fission wars of the late 20th cen- 
tury. They were rebuilt and de- 
stroyed again in the war of the 
World Restoration in the 21st 
century. Once more they were re- 
built and this time covered over 
with blastproof crystal, turning 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the stairs into a stepped Galleria. 
The dome of the Galleria cut off 
the view from the death chamber 
in Keats’ house. No longer would 
visitors peep through the narrow 
window and see the last sight that 
met the dying poet’s eyes. Now 
they saw the smoky dome of the 
Spanish Stairs, and through it the 
distorted figures of corruption 
below. 

The Galleria of the Stairs was 
illuminated at night, and this New 
Year’s Eve was chaotic. For cen- 
turies, Rome has welcomed the 
New Year with a bombardment — 
firecrackers, rockets, torpedoes, 
gunshots, bottles, shoes, old pots 
and pans. Romans save junk for 
months to be hurled out of top 
floor windows when midnight 
strikes. 

The roar of fireworks inside 
the Stairs and the clatter of debris 
clashing on the Galleria roof were 
deafening as Foyle and Robin 
Wednesbury climbed down from 
the carnival in the Borghese Pal- 
ace. 

r | 1 HEY were still in costume — 
Foyle in the livid crimson- 
and-black tights and doublet of 
Cesare Borgia, Robin in the silver- 
encrusted gown of Lucrezia Bor- 
gia. They wore grotesque velvet 
masks. The contrast between 
their Renaissance costume and 
the modern clothes around them 
brought forth jeers and catcalls. 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



Even the Lobos who frequented 
the Spanish Stairs, the unfortu- 
nate habitual criminals who had 
had a quarter of their brains 
burned out by prefrontal lobot- 
omy, were aroused from their 
frightful apathy to stare. The 
mob seethed around the couple 
as they descended the Galleria. 

“Poggi,” Foyle called quietly. 
“Angelo Poggi?” 

A bawd bellowed anatomical 
adjurations at him. 

“Poggi? Angelo Poggi?” Foyle 
was impassive. “I’m told he can 
be found on the Stairs at night. 
Angelo Poggi?” 

A whore maligned his mother. 
“Angelo Poggi? Ten credits to 
anyone who brings me to him.” 
Foyle was ringed with extended 
hands, some filthy, some scented, 
all greedy. He shook his head. 
“Show me first.” 

Roman rage crackled around 
him. 

“Poggi? Angelo Poggi?” 

* * * 

After six weeks of loitering on 
the Spanish Stairs, Captain Peter 
Y’ang- Yeovil at last heard the 
words he had hoped to hear. Six 
weeks of tedious assumption of 
the identity of Angelo Poggi, 
chefs assistant off the Vorga, 
long dead, was finally paying off. 

It had been a gamble, first risked 
when Intelligence had brought 
the news to Captain Y’ang- Yeovil 
that someone was making cau- 

103 



tious inquiries about the crew of 
the Presteign Vorga, and paying 
heavily for information. 

“It’s a long-shot,” Y’ang-Yeovil 
had said, “but Gully Foyle did 
make that lunatic attempt to 
blow up Vorga. And twenty 
pounds of PyrE is worth a long- 
shot.” 

Now he waddled up the stairs 
toward the man in the Renais- 
sance costume and mask. He had 
put on forty pounds with glandu- 
lar shots. He had darkened his 
complexion with diet manipula- 
tion. His features, never of an 
Oriental cast but cut more along 
the hawklike lines of the ancient 
American Indian, easily fell into 
an unreliable pattern with a little 
muscular control. 

The Intelligence man panted 
up the Spanish Stairs, a gross 
cook with a larcenous counte- 
nance. He extended a package of 
soiled envelopes toward Foyle. 

“Filthy pictures, signore? Cel- 
lar-Christians, kneeling, praying, 
singing psalms, kissing cross? 
Very naughty.” 

“No.” Foyle brushed the pornog- 
raphy aside. “I’m looking for An- 
gelo Poggi.” 

Y’ANG-YEOVIL signaled mi- 
croscopically. His crew on the 
stairs began photographing and 
recording the interview without 
ceasing its pimping and whoring. 
The Secret Speech of the Intelli- 



gence Tong of the Inner Planets 
Armed Forces wigwagged around 
Foyle and Robin in the ancient 
Chinese sign-language of eyelids, 
eyebrows, fingertips and infini- 
tesimal body motions. 

“Signore?” Y’ang-Yeovil 
wheezed. 

“Angelo Poggi?” 

“Si, signore,” Y’ang-Yeovil re- 
plied. “I am Poggi.” 

“Chefs assistant off the 
Vorga?” Expecting the same start 
of terror manifested by Forrest 
and Orel, which he at last under- 
stood, Foyle shot out a hand and 
grabbed Y’ang-Yeovil’s elbow. 
“Yes?” 

“Si, signore,” Y’ong-Yeovil re- 
plied tranquilly. “How can I serve 
your worship?” 

“Maybe this one can come 
through,” Foyle murmured to 
Robin. “He’s not scared. Maybe 
he knows a way around the Block. 
I want information from you, 
Poggi.” 

“Of what nature, signore, and 
at what price?” 

“Anything you’ve got. Name 
your price.” 

“But, signore! I am a man full 
of years and experience. I am not 
to be bought in wholesale lots. I 
must be paid item by item. Make 
your selection and I will name 
the price. What do you want?” 

“You were aboard Vorga on 
September 16th, 2436?” 

“That item costs Cr 10.”

Foyle smiled mirthlessly and 
paid. 

“I was, signore.” 

“I want to know about a ship 
you passed out near the Asteroid 
Belt. The wreck of the Nomad. 
You passed her on September six- 
teen. Nomad signaled for help 
and Vorga passed her by. Who 
gave that order?” 

“Ah, signore!” 

“Who gave you that order and 
why?” 

“I must know why a question is 
asked before I answer, signore.” 
Y’ang- Yeovil smiled greasily. 
“And I will pay for my caution 
by cutting the price. Why are you 
interested in Vorga and Nomad 
and this shocking abandonment 
in space? Were you, perhaps, the 
unfortunate who was so cruelly 
treated?” 

“He’s not Italian! His accent’s 
perfect, but the speech pattern’s 
all wrong. No Italian would frame 
sentences like that.” 

Foyle stiffened in alarm. Y’ang- 
Yeovil’s eyes, sharpened to detect 
and deduce from minutiae, caught 
the change in attitude. He realized 
at once that he had slipped some- 
how. 

He signaled to his crew 
urgently. 

WHITE-HOT brawl broke 
out on the Spanish Stairs. In 
an instant, Foyle and Robin were 
caught up in a screaming, strug- 



gling mob. The crews of the In- 
telligence Tong were past-masters 
of this OP-I maneuver, designed 
to outwit a jaunting world. Their 
split-second timing could knock 
any man off balance and strip 
him for identification. Their suc- 
cess was based on the simple fact 
that between unexpected assault 
and defensive response, there 
must always be a recognition lag. 
Within the space of that lag, the 
Intelligence Tong guaranteed to 
prevent any man from saving 
himself. 

In three-fifths of a second Foyle 
was battered, kneed, hammered 
across the forehead, dropped to 
the steps and spread-eagled. The 
mask was plucked from his face, 
portions of his clothes torn away, 
and he was helpless for the iden- 
tification cameras. Then, for the 
first time in the history of the 
tong, their schedule was inter- 
rupted. 

A man appeared, straddling 
Foyle’s body — a huge man with a 
hideously tattooed face and 
clothes that smoked and flamed. 
The apparition was so appalling 
that the crew stopped dead and 
stared. A howl went up from the 
crowd on the Stairs. 

“The Burning Man!” 

“But thafs Foyle,” Y’ang-Yeo- 
vil whispered. 

For perhaps a quarter of a min- 
ute, the apparition stood, silent, 
burning, staring with blind eyes. 




106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Then it disappeared. The man 
spread-eagled on the ground dis- 
appeared, too. He turned into a 
blur of action that whipped 
through the crew, locating and de- 
stroying cameras, recorders, all 
identification apparatus. Then the 
blur seized the girl in the Renais- 
sance gown and vanished. 

The Spanish Stairs came to life 
again, painfully, as though strug- 
gling out of a nightmare. The be- 
wildered Intelligence crew clus- 
tered around Y’ang-Yeovil. 

“What in God’s name was that, 
Yeo?” 

“I think it was our man. Gully 
Foyle. You saw that tattooed 
face.” 

“And the burning clothes!” 
“Looked like a witch at the 
stake.” 

“But if that burning man was 
Foyle, who were we wasting our 
time on?” 

“I don’t know. Does the Com- 
mando Brigade have an Intelli- 
gence service they haven’t both- 
ered to mention to us?” 

“Why the Commandos, Yeo?” 
“You saw the way he acceler- 
ated, didn’t you? He destroyed 
every record we made.” 

“I still can’t believe my eyes.” 
“That was top secret Com- 
mando technique. They take 
their men apart and rewire and 
regear them. I’ll have to check 
with Mars HQ and find out 
whether Commando Brigade’s

running a parallel investigation.” 

“Does the army tell the navy?” 

“They’ll tell Intelligence,” 
Y’ang-Yeovil said angrily. “This 
case is critical enough without 
jurisdictional hassels. And an- 
other thing: there was no need to 
manhandle that girl in the ma- 
neuver. It was undisciplined and 
unnecessary.” Y’ang - Yeovil 
paused, for once unaware of the 
significant glances passing around 
him. “I must find out who she 
is,” he added dreamily. 

“If she’s been regeared, too, 
it’ll be real interesting, Yeo,” said 
a bland voice, markedly devoid 
of implication. “Boy Meets Com- 
mando.” 

Y’ang - Yeovil flushed. “All 
right,” he blurted. “I’m transpar- 
ent.” 

“Just repetitious, Yeo. All your 
romances start the same way. 
‘There’s no need to manhandle 
that girl.’ And then Dolly Quaker, 
Jean Webster, Gwynn Roget, Ma- 
rion — ” 

“No names, please!” a shocked 
voice interrupted. “Does Romeo 
tell Juliet?” 

“You’re all going on latrine as- 
signment tomorrow,” Y’ang-Yeo- 
vil said. “I’m damned if I’ll stand 
for this salacious insubordination. 
No, not tomorrow; but as soon as 
this case is closed.” His hawk- 
face darkened. “What a mess! 
Will you ever forget Foyle stand- 
ing there like a burning brand?

But where is he? What’s he up to? 
What’s it all mean?”

"DRESTEIGN of Presteign’s 
mansion in Central Park was 
ablaze for the New Year. Charm- 
ing antique electric bulbs with 
zigzag filaments and pointed tips 
shed yellow light. The jaunte,- 
proof maze had been removed 
and the great door was open for 
the special occasion. The interior 
of the house was protected from 
the gaze of the crowd outside by 
a jeweled screen just inside the 
door. 

The sightseers buzzed and ex- 
claimed as the famous and near- 
famous of clan and sept arrived 
by car, by coach, by litter, by 
every form of luxurious transpor- 
tation. Presteign of Presteign 
himself stood before the door, 
iron-gray, handsome, smiling his 
basilisk smile, and welcomed so- 
ciety to his open house. Hardly 
had a celebrity stepped through 
the door and disappeared behind 
the screen when another, even 
more famous, came clattering up 
in a vehicle even more fabulous. 

The Colas arrived in a band 
wagon. The Esso family (six sons, 
three daughters) was magnificent 
in a glass-topped Greyhound bus. 
But Greyhound arrived (in an 
Edison Electric Runabout) hard 
on their heels and there was much 

108 



laughter and chaffing at the door. 
But when Edison of Westing- 
house dismounted from his Esso- 
fueled gasoline buggy, completing 
the circle, the laughter on the 
steps turned into a roar. 

Just as the crowd of guests 
turned to enter Presteign’s home, 
a distant commotion attracted 
their attention. It was a rumble, 
a fierce chatter of pneumatic 
punches, and an outrageous me- 
tallic bellowing. It approached 
rapidly. The outer fringe of sight- 
seers opened a broad lane. A 
heavy truck rumbled down the 
lane. Six men were tumbling 
baulks of timber out the back of 
the truck. Following them came a 
crew of twenty arranging the 
baulks neatly in rows. 

Presteign and his guests 
watched with amazement. A giant 
machine approached, bellowing 
and pounding, crawling over the 
ties. Behind it were deposited 
parallel rails of welded steel. 
Crews with pneumatic sledges 
spiked the rails to the timber ties. 
The track was laid to Presteign’s 
door in a sweeping arc and then 
curved away. The bellowing en- 
gine and crews disappeared into 
the darkness. 

“Good God!” Presteign was dis- 
tinctly heard to say. Guests 
poured out of the house to watch. 

A shrill whistle sounded in the 
distance. Down the track came a 
man on a white horse, carrying a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



large red flag. Behind him panted 
a steam locomotive drawing a 
single observation car. The train 
stopped before Presteign’s door. 
A conductor swung down from 
the car, followed by a pullman 
porter. The porter arranged steps. 
A lady and gentleman in evening 
clothes descended. 

“Shan’t be long,” the gentleman 
told the conductor. “Come back 
for me in an hour.” 

“Good God!” Presteign ex- 
claimed again. 

HP HE train puffed off. The cou- 
pie mounted the steps. 

“Good evening, Presteign,” the 
gentleman said. “Terribly sorry 
about that horse messing up your 
grounds, but the old New York 
franchise still insists on the red 
flag in front of trains.” 

“Fourmyle!” the guests shouted. 

“Fourmyle of Ceres!” the sight- 
seers cheered. 

Presteign’s party was now an 
assured success. 

Inside the vast velvet and plush 
reception hall, Presteign exam- 
ined Fourmyle curiously. Foyle 
endured the keen gaze with equa- 
nimity, meanwhile nodding and 
smiling to the enthusiastic admir- 
ers he had acquired from Can- 
berra to New York, with whom 
Robin Wednesbury was chatting. 

“Control,” he thought. “He 
grilled me in his office for one 
hour after that crazy attempt I 



made on Vorga. Will he recognize 
me? Your face is familiar, Pres- 
teign,” Fourmyle said. “Have we 
met before?” 

“I have not had the honor of 
meeting a Fourmyle until to- 
night,” Presteign answered am- 
biguously. 

Foyle had trained himself to 
read men, but Presteign’s hard, 
handsome features were unread- 
able. Standing face to face, the 
one detached and compelled, the 
other reserved and indomitable, 
they looked like a pair of brazen 
statues at white heat, on the verge 
of running molten. 

“I’m told that you are proud 
of being an upstart, Fourmyle.” 
“Yes. I’ve patterned myself 
after the first Presteign.” 
“Indeed?” 

“You will remember that he 
boasted of starting the family for- 
tune in the plasma black market 
during the Third World War.” 
“The second, Fourmyle. But the 
hypocrites of our clan never ac- 
knowledge him. The name was 
Payne then.” 

“I know.” 

“And what was your unhappy 
name before you changed it to 
Fourmyle?” 

“It was Presteign.” 

“Indeed?” The basilisk smile 
acknowledged the hit. “You claim 
a relationship with our clan?” 

“I will claim it in time.” 

“Of what degree?” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION

“Let’s say a close blood rela- 
tionship.” 

“I detect a certain fascination 
for blood in you, Fourmyle.” 
“No doubt a family weakness, 
Presteign.” 

“You’re pleased to be cynical,” 
Presteign said, not without cyni- 
cism, “but you speak the truth. 
We have always had a fatal 
weakness for blood and money. It 
is our vice. I admit it.” 

“And I share it.” 

“A passion for blood and 
money?” 

“Most passionately.” 

“Without mercy, without for- 
giveness, without hypocrisy?” 
“And completely without con- 
science.” 

“Fourmyle, you are a young 
man after my own heart. If you 
do not claim a relationship with 
our clan, I shall be forced to 
adopt you.” 

“You’re too late, Presteign. 
I’ve already adopted you.” 

TJRESTEIGN took Foyle’s arm. 

“You must be presented to 
my daughter, Lady Olivia. Will 
you allow me?” 

They crossed the reception hall. 
Foyle hesitated, wondering wheth- 
er he should call Robin to stand 
by for impending emergencies, 
but he was too triumphant. “He 
doesn’t know. He’ll never know.” 
Then doubt came : “But I’ll never 
know if he does know. He’s cru- 



cible steel. He could teach me 
about control.” 

Acquaintances hailed Four- 
myle. 

“Wonderful deception you 
worked in Shanghai.” 

“Marvelous carnival in Rome, 
wasn’t it? Did you hear about the 
burning man who appeared on 
the Spanish Stairs?” 

“We looked for you in London.” 
“What a splendid entrance that 
was,” Harry Sherwin-Williams 
called. “Outdid us all, Fourmyle. 
Made us look like a pack of 
damned pikers.” 

“You forget yourself, Harry,” 
Presteign said coldly. “You know 
I permit no profanity in my 
home.” 

“Sorry, Presteign. Where’s the 
circus now, Fourmyle?” 

“I don’t know,” Foyle said. 
“Just a moment.” 

A crowd gathered, grinning in 
anticipation of the latest Four- 
myle folly. He took out a plati- 
num watch and snapped open the 
case. The face of a valet appeared 
on the dial. 

“Ahhh — whatever your name 
is — where are we staying just 
now?” 

The answer was tiny and tinny. 
“You gave orders to make New 
York your permanent residence, 
Fourmyle.” 

“Oh? Did I? And?” 

“We bought St. Patrick’s Ca- 
thedral, Fourmyle.” 



no 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“And where is that?” 

“Old St. Patrick’s, Fourmyle. 
On Fifth Avenue and what was 
formerly 50th Street. We’ve 
pitched the camp inside.” 

“Thank you.” Fourmyle closed 
the platinum Hunter. “There’s one 
thing to be said for the outlawed 
religions: At least they built 

churches big enough to house a 
circus.” 

Olivia Presteign was seated on 
a dais, surrounded by admirers 
paying court to this beautiful al- 
bino daughter of Presteign. She 
was strangely and wonderfully 
blind, for she could see in the 
infra-red only, from 7,500 Ang- 
stroms to one millimeter wave- 
lengths far below the normal visi- 
ble spectrum. She saw heat waves, 
magnetic fields, radio waves; she 
saw her admirers in a strange 
light of organic emanations 
against a background of red radi- 
ation. 

She? was a Snow Maiden, an Ice 
Princess with coral eyes and coral 
lips, imperious, mysterious, unat- 
tainable. Foyle looked at her once 
and lowered his eyes in confusion 
before the blind gaze that could 
only see him as electromagnetic 
waves and infra-red light. His 
pulse began to beat faster; a hun- 
dred lightning fantasies about 
himself and Olivia Presteign 
flashed in his heart. 

“Don’t be a fool!” he thought 
desperately. “Control yourself. 



Stop dreaming. This can be dan- 
gerous . .” 

H E WAS introduced, was ad- 
dressed in a husky, silvery 
voice, was given a cool, slim hand; 
but the hand seemed to explode 
within his with an electric shock. 
It was almost a start of mutual 
recognition . almost a joining of 
emotional impact. 

“This is insane. She’s a symbol. 
The Dream Princess. The Unat- 
tainable. Control!” 

He was fighting so hard that he 
scarcely realized he had been dis- 
missed, graciously and indiffer- 
ently. He could not believe it. He 
stood gaping like a lout. 

“What? Are you still here, 
Fourmyle?” 

“I couldn’t believe I’d been dis- 
missed, Lady Olivia.” 

“Hardly that, but I’m afraid 
you are in the way of my friends.” 
“I’m not used to being dis- 
missed. No. No. All wrong! At 
least by someone I’d like to count 
as a friend.” 

“Don’t be tedious, Fourmyle. 
Do step down.” 

“How have I offended you?” 
“Offended me? Now you’re be- 
ing ridiculous.” 

“Lady Olivia . Can’t I say 
anything right? Where’s Robin? 
Can we start again, please?” 

“If you’re trying to be gauche, 
Fourmyle, you’re succeeding.” 
“Your hand again, please. 

Hi 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



Thank you. I’m Fourmyle of 
Ceres.” 

She laughed. “I’ll concede 
you’re a clown. Now do step 
down. I’m sure you can find some- 
one to amuse.” 

“What’s happened this time?” 
he demanded. 

“Really, sir, are you trying to 
make me angry?” 

“No. Yes, I am. Trying to touch 
you somehow, cut through the ice. 
The first time, our handclasp was 
— violent. Now it’s nothing. What 
happened?” 

“Fourmyle,” Olivia said wea- 
rily, “I’ll grant that you’re amus- 
ing, original, witty, fascinating — 
I’ll grant you anything, anything 
you wish, if you will only go 
away.” 

He stumbled off the dais. 
“Bitch. Bitch. Bitch. No. She’s the 
dream just as I dreamed her. The 
icy pinnacle to be stormed and 
taken.” 

He came face to face with Saul 
Dagenham. 

He stood paralyzed. 

“Ah, Fourmyle,” Presteign said. 
“This is Saul Dagenham. He can 
only give us thirty minutes and 
he insists on spending one of 
them with you.” 

“Does he know? Did he send 
for Dagenham to make sure? At- 
tack. T ou jours audace. What hap- 
pened to your face, Dagenham?” 
Fourmyle asked with detached 
curiosity. 

112 



r pHE death’s-head smiled. “And 
I thought I was famous. Radi- 
ation poisoning. Time was when 
they said ‘Hotter than a pistol.’ 
Now they say ‘Hotter than Dag- 
enham.’ ” The deadly eyes raked 
Foyle. “What’s behind that circus 
of yours?” 

“A passion for notoriety.” 

“I’m an old hand at camou- 
flage myself. I recognize the signs. 
What’s your larceny?” 

“Did Dillinger tell Capone?” 
Foyle smiled back, beginning to 
relax, restraining his triumph. 
“I’ve outfaced them both. You 
look happier, Dagenham.” In- 
stantly he realized the slip. 

Dagenham picked it up in a 
flash. “Happier than when? Where 
did we meet before?” 

“Not happier than when; hap- 
pier than me.” Foyle turned to 
Presteign. “I’ve fallen desperately 
in love with Lady Olivia.” 

“Saul, your half hour’s up.” 
Dagenham and Presteign, on 
either side of Foyle, turned. A tall 
woman approached, stately in an 
emerald evening gown, her red 
hair gleaming. It was Jisbella Mc- 
Queen. Before the shock could 
seethe into his face, Foyle turned, 
ran six steps to the first door he 
saw, opened it and darted through. 

The door slammed behind him. 
He was in a short blind corridor. 
There was a click, a pause, and 
then a canned voice spoke cour- 
teously: “You have invaded a pri- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



vate portion of this residence. 
Please return.” 

Foyle gasped and struggled 
with himself. 

“You have invaded a private 
portion of this residence. Please 
return.” 

“I never knew. Thought she 
was killed out there. She recog- 
nized me . .” 

“You have invaded a private 
portion of this residence. Please 
return.” 

"I’m finished. She’ll never for- 
give me. Must be telling Dagen- 
ham and Presteign now.” 

The door from the Reception 
Hall opened, and for a moment, 
Foyle thought he saw his flaming 
image. Then he realized he was 
looking at Jisbella’s flaming hair. 
She made no move, just stood and 
smiled at him in furious triumph. 
He straightened. 

“By God, I won’t go down 
whining.” 

Without haste, Foyle sauntered 
out of the corridor, took Jisbella’s 
arm and led her back to the Re- 
ception Hall. He never bothered 
to look around for Dagenham or 
Presteign. They would present 
themselves, with force and arms, 
in due time. He smiled at Jis- 
belln; she smiled back, still in 
triumph. 

“Thanks for running away, 
Gully. I never dreamed it could 
be so satisfying.” 

“Running away? My dear Jiz!” 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



“Well?” 

“I can’t tell you how lovely 
you’re looking tonight. We’ve 
come a long way from Gouffre 
Martel, haven’t we?” Foyle mo- 
tioned to the ballroom. “Dance?” 

TTER eyes widened in surprise 
at his composure. She per- 
mitted him to escort her to the 
ballroom and take her in his arms. 

“By the way, Jiz, how did you 
manage to keep out of Gouffre 
Martel?” 

“Dagenham arranged it. So you 
dance now, Gully?” 

“I dance, speak four languages 
miserably, study science and phi- 
losophy, write pitiful poetry, blow 
myself up with idiotic experi- 
ments, fence like a fool, box like 
a buffoon ... In short, I’m the 
notorious Fourmyle of Ceres.” 
“No longer Gully Foyle.” 

“Only to you, dear, and who- 
ever you’ve told.” 

“Just Dagenham. Are you sorry 
I blew your secret?” 

“You couldn’t help yourself 
any more than I could.” 

“No, I couldn’t. Your name just 
popped out of me. What would 
you have paid me to keep my 
mouth shut?” 

“Don’t be a fool, Jiz. This ac- 
cident’s going to earn you about 
Cr 17,980,000.” 

“What d’you mean?” 

“I told you I’d give you what 
was left after I finished Vorga.” 

113 



“You’ve finished Vorga?” she 
said in surprise. 

“No, dear, you’ve finished me. 
But I’ll keep my promise.” 

She laughed. “Generous Gully 
Foyle. Be real generous, Gully. 
Make a run for it. Entertain me 
a little.” 

“Squealing like a rat? I don’t 
know how, Jiz. I’m trained for 
hunting; nothing else.” 

“And I killed the tiger. Give me 
one satisfaction, Gully. Say you 
were close to Vorga. I ruined you 
when you were half a step from 
the finish. Yes?” 

“I wish I could, Jiz, but I can’t. 
I’m nowhere. I was trying to pick 
up another lead to Vorga here 
tonight.” 

“Poor Gully. Maybe I can help 
you out of this jam. I can say — 
oh, that I made a mistake — or a 
joke— that you really aren’t Gully 
Foyle. I know how to confuse 
Saul. I can do it, Gully — if you 
still love me.” 

He looked down at her and 
shook his head. “It’s never been 
love between us, Jiz. You know 
that. I’m too one-track to be any- 
thing but a hunter.” 

“Too one-track to be anything 
but a fool!” 

“What did you mean, Jiz — 
Dagenham arranged to keep you 
out of Gouffre Martel and you 
know how to confuse him? What 
have you got to do with Dagen- 
ham?” 

114 



“I work for him. I’m one of his 
couriers.” 

“You mean he’s blackmailing 
you? Threatening to send you 
back if you don’t — ” 

“No. We hit it off the minute 
we met. He started off capturing 
me; I ended up capturing him.” 
“How do you mean?” 

“Can’t you guess?” 

T? OYLE stared at her. Her eyes 
were veiled, but he under- 
stood. “Jiz! With him?” 

“Yes.” 

“But how? He’s radioactive. 
He-” 

“There are precautions. It’s . 
I don’t want to talk about it, 
Gully.” 

“Sorry. He’s a long time re- 
turning.” 

“Returning?” 

“Dagenham. With his army.” 
“Oh. Yes, of course.” Jisbella 
laughed again, then spoke in a 
low, furious tone. “You don’t 
know what a tightrope you’ve 
been walking, Gully. If you’d 
begged or bribed or tried to ro- 
mance me . damn you, I’d have 
ruined you. I’d have told the 
world who you were, screamed it 
from the housetops—” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“Saul isn’t returning. He doesn’t 
know. You can go to hell on your 
own.” 

“I don’t believe you.” 

“D’you think it would take him 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this long to get you? Saul Dag- 
enham?” 

“But why didn’t you tell him? 
After the way I ran out on you — ” 
“Because I don’t want him go- 
ing to hell with you. I’m not talk- 
ing about Vorga. I mean some- 
thing else. PyrE. That’s what 
they’re after — twenty pounds of 
PyrE.” 

“What’s that?” 

“When you got the safe open, 
was there a small box in it? Made 
of ILI— Inert Lead Isomer?” 
“Yes.” 

“What was inside the ILI box?” 
“Twenty slugs that looked like 
compressed iodine crystals.” 
“What did you do with the 
slugs?” 

“Sent two out for analysis. No 
one could find out what they are. 
I’m trying to run an analysis on 
a third in my lab — when I’m not 
clowning for the public.” 

“Oh, you are, are you? Why?” 
“I’m growing up, Jiz,” Foyle 
said gently. “It didn’t take much 
to figure out that was what Pres- 
teign and Dagenham were after.” 
“Where have you got the rest 
of the slugs?” 

“In a safe place.” 

“They’re not safe. They can’t 
ever be safe. I don’t know what 
PyrE is, but I know it’s the road 
to hell and I don’t want Saul 
walking it.” 

“You love him that much?” 

“I respect him that much. He’s 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



the first man who ever showed me 
an excuse for the double stand- 
ard.” 

“Jiz, what is PyrE? You know.” 
“I’ve guessed. I’ve pieced to- 
gether the hints I’ve heard. And I 
could tell you, Gully, but I won’t.” 
The fury in her face was lumi- 
nous. “I’m running out on you this 
time. I’m leaving you to hang 
helpless in the dark. See what it 
feels like!” 

S HE broke away from him and 
swept across the ballroom 
floor. At that moment, the first 
bombs fell. 

They came in like meteor 
swarms; not so many, but far 
more deadly. They came in on 
the morning quadrant, that quar- 
ter of the globe in darkness from 
midnight to dawn. They collided 
head-on with the forward side of 
the Earth in its revolution around 
the Sun. They had been traveling 
a distance of four hundred million 
miles. 

Their excessive speed was 
matched by the rapidity of the 
Terran defense computers which 
traced and intercepted these New 
Year gifts from the Outer Satel- 
lites within the space of micro- 
seconds. A multitude of fierce new 
stars prickled in the sky and van- 
ished; they were bombs detected 
and detonated five hundred miles 
above their target. 

But so narrow was the margin 

115 



between speed of defense and 
speed of attack that some got 
through. They shot through the 
aurora level, the meteor level, 
the twilight limit, the stratosphere, 
and down to Earth. The invisible 
trajectories ended in titanic con- 
vulsions. 

The first atomic explosion 
which destroyed Newark shook 
the Presteign mansion with an un- 
believable quake. Floors and 
walls shuddered and the guests 
were thrown in heaps along with 
furniture and decorations. Quake 
followed quake as the random 
shower descended around New 
York. They were deafening, 
numbing, chilling. The sounds, the 
shocks, the flares of lurid light on 
the horizon were so enormous 
that reason was stripped from 
humanity, leaving nothing but 
flayed animals to shriek, cower 
and run. Within the space of sec- 
onds, Presteign’s New Year party 
was transformed from elegance 
into anarchy. 

Foyle arose from the floor. He 
looked at the struggling bodies on 
the ballroom parquet, saw Jis- 
bella fighting to free herself, took 
a step toward her and then 
stopped. He revolved his head 
dazedly, feeling it was no part of 
him. The thunder never ceased. 
He saw Robin Wednesbury in the 
Reception Hall, reeling and bat- 
tered. He took a step toward her 
and then stopped again. He knew 

Hi 



precisely where he must go. 

He accelerated. The thunder 
and lightning dropped down the 
spectrum to grinding and flicker- 
ing. The shuddering quakes 
turned into greasy undulations. 
Foyle blurred through the giant 
house, searching, until at last he 
found her in the garden, standing 
tiptoe on a marble bench, looking 
like a marble statue to his accel- 
erated senses — the statue of exal- 
tation. 

TIE DECELERATED. Sensa- 
tion leaped up the spectrum 
again and once more he was buf- 
feted by that bigger-than-death- 
size bombardment. 

“Lady Olivia,” he called. 

“Who is that?” 

“The clown.” 

“Fourmyle?” 

“Yes.” 

“And you came searching for 
me? I’m touched, really touched.” 
“You’re insane to be standing 
out here like this. I beg you to let 
me — ” 

“No, no, no. It’s beautiful. Mag- 
nificent!” 

“Let me jaunte with you to 
some place that’s safe.” 

“Ah, you see yourself as a 
knight in armor? Chivalry to the 
rescue. You haven’t the flair for 
it. You’d best go.” 

“I’ll stay.” 

“As a beauty-lover?” 

“As a lover.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You’re still tedious, Fourmyle. 
Come, be inspired. This is Arma- 
geddon. Flowering Monstrosity. 
Tell me what you see.” 

“There’s nothing much,” he 
answered, looking around and 
wincing. “There’s light all over 
the horizon. Quick clouds of it. 
Above, there’s a — a sort of spar- 
kling effect. Like Christmas lights 
twinkling.” 

“Oh, you see so little with your 
eyes! See what I see! There’s a 
dome in the sky, a rainbow dome. 
The colors run from deep tang to 
brilliant burn. That’s what I’ve 
named the colors I see. What 
would that dome be?” 

“The radar screen.” 

“And then there are vasty 
shafts of fire thrusting up and 
swaying, weaving, dancing, sweep- 
ing. What are they?” 

“Interceptor beams. You’re see- 
ing the whole electronic- defense 
system.” 

“And I can see the bombs com- 
ing down, too — swift streaks of 
what you call red. But not your 
red. Mine. Why can I see them?” 
“They’re heated by air friction, 
but the inert lead casing doesn’t 
show the color to us.” 

“See how much better you’re 
doing as Galileo than Galahad. 
Oh! There’s one coming down in 
the east. Watch for it! It’s coming, 
coming, coming . Now!” 

A flare of light on the eastern 
horizon proved it was not her 



imagination. It was very real. 

“There’s another to the north. 
Very close. Very. Now!” 

A SHOCK tore down from the 
north. 

“And the explosions, Four- 
myle,” she said breathlessly. 
“They’re not just clouds of light. 
They’re fabrics, webs, tapestries 
of meshing colors. So beautiful. 
Like exquisite shrouds.” 

“Which they are, Lady Olivia,” 
muttered Foyle. 

“Are you afraid?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then run away.” 

“No.” 

“Ah, you’re defiant.” 

“I don’t know what I am. I’m 
scared, but I won’t run.” 

“Then you’re making a show of 
knightly courage.” The husky 
voice sounded amused. “Just 
think, Fourmyle. How long does 
it take to jaunte? You could be 
safe in seconds — in Mexico, Can- 
ada, Alaska. There must be mil- 
lions there now. We’re probably 
the last left in the city.” 

“Not everybody can jaunte so 
far and so fast.” 

“Then we’re the last left who 
count. Why don’t you leave me? 
Save yourself. I’ll be killed soon. 
No one will ever know you turned 
tail.” 

“Bitch!” 

“Ah, you’re angry. What shock- 
ing language. It’s the first sign of 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



117 




weakness. Why don’t you exercise 
your better judgment and carry 
me off? That would be the second 
sign.” 

“Damn you!” 

He stepped close to her, clench- 
ing his fists in rage. She touched 
his cheek with a cool, quiet hand, 
but once again there was that 
electric shock. 

“No, it’s too late, my dear,” she 
said quietly. “Here comes a whole 
cluster of red streaks — down, 
down, down — directly at us. 
There’ll be no escaping this. 
Jaunte! Take me with you. Quick! 
Quick!” 

He swept her off the bench. 
“Bitch! Never!” 

He held her, found the soft 
coral mouth and kissed her, 
bruised her lips with his, waiting 
for the final blackout. 

The concussion never came. 

“Tricked!” he exclaimed. She 
laughed. He kissed her again and 
at last forced himself to release 
her. She gasped for breath, then 



laughed again, her coral eyes 
blazing. 

“It’s over,” she said. 

“It hasn’t begun yet.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“The war between us.” 

“Make it a human war,” she 
said fiercely. “You’re the first not 
to be deceived by my looks. Oh, 
God! The boredom of the chival- 
rous knights and their milk-warm 
passion for the fairy-tale princess. 
But I’m not like that inside. I’m 
not. Never! Make it a savage war 
between us. Don’t win me — de- 
stroy me!” 

SUDDENLY she was Lady 
^ Olivia again, the gracious 
snow maiden. “I’m afraid the bom- 
bardment has finished, my dear 
Fourmyle. The show is over. But 
what an exciting prelude to the 
New Year. Good night.” 

“Good night?” he echoed in- 
credulously. 

“Good night,” she repeated. 
“Really, my dear Fourmyle, are

119 



you so gauche that you never 
know when you’re dismissed? 
You may go now. Good night.” 

He hesitated, searched for 
words, and at last turned and 
lurched out of the house. He was 
trembling with elation and confu- 
sion. He walked in a daze, 
scarcely aware of the confusion 
and disaster around him. The ho- 
rizon now was lit with the light 
of red flames. The shock waves of 
the assault had whipped the at- 
mosphere so violently that winds 
still whistled in strange gusts. 
Brick, cornice, glass and metal 
were tumbling and crashing. And 
this despite the fact that no direct 
hit had been made on New York. 

The streets were empty; the 
city was deserted. The entire pop- 
ulation of New York, of every 
city, had jaunted in a desperate 
search for safety, to the limit of 
their ability — five miles, fifty 
miles, five hundred miles. Some 
had jaunted into the center of a 
direct hit. Thousands died in 
jaunte explosions, for the stages 
had not been designed to accom- 
modate a mass exodus. 

Foyle became aware of white- 
armored Disaster Crews appear- 
ing on the streets. An imperious 
signal warned him that he was 
about to be summarily drafted for 
disaster work. The problem of 
jaunting was not to get popula- 
tions out of cities, but to force 
them to return and restore order. 

120 



Foyle had no intention of spend- 
ing a week fighting fire and loot- 
ers. He accelerated and evaded 
the Disaster Crew. 

At Fifth Avenue, he deceler- 
ated. The drain of acceleration 
was so enormous that he was re- 
luctant to maintain it for more 
than a few moments. Long peri- 
ods of acceleration demanded 
days of recuperation. 

The looters and Jack-jaunters 
were already at work on the ave- 
nue, singly, in swarms, furtive yet 
savage, jackals rending the body 
of a living but helpless animal. 
They descended on Foyle. Any- 
thing was their prey tonight. 

“I’m not in the mood,” he told 
them. “Play with somebody else.” 

He emptied the money out of 
his pockets and tossed it to them. 
They snapped it up but were not 
satisfied. They desired entertain- 
ment and he looked like a help- 
less gentleman. Half a dozen sur- 
rounded Foyle and closed in. 

“We’re going to have a party,” 
one said. 

Foyle had once seen the muti- 
lated body of one of their party 
guests. He sighed and detached 
his mind from visions of Olivia 
Presteign. 

“All right, jackals,” he said. 
“Let’s have a party.” 

* I 'HEY prepared to send him 
into a screaming dance. Foyle 
tripped the switchboard in his

mouth and became for twelve 
devastating seconds the most 
murderous machine ever devised 
— the Commando killer. It was 
done without conscious thought 
or volition; his body merely fol- 
lowed the directive taped into 
muscle and reflex. He left six 
jackals stretched on the street 
and jaunted to old St. Pat’s. 

The cathedral still stood, un- 
blemished, eternal, the distant 
fires flickering on the green cop- 
per of its roof. Inside, it was de- 
serted. The tents of the Four Mile 
Circus filled the nave, illuminated 
and furnished, but the circus per- 
sonnel was gone. Servants, chefs, 
valets, athletes, philosophers, 
camp-followers and crooks had 
fled. 

“But they’ll be back to loot,” 
Foyle murmured. 

He entered his own tent. The 
first thing he saw was a figure in 
white, crouched on a rug, croon- 
ing sunnily to itself. It was Robin 
Wednesbury, her gown in tatters, 
her mind in tatters. 

“Robin!” 

She went on crooning word- 
lessly. He pulled her up, shook 
her and slapped her. She beamed 
and crooned. He filled a syringe 
and gave her a tremendous shot 
of Niacin. The sobering wrench 
on her pathetic flight from reality 
was ghastly. Her satin skin turned 
ashen. The beautiful face twisted. 
She recognized Foyle, remem-

bered what she had tried to for- 
get, screamed and sank to her 
knees. She began to cry. 

“That’s better,” he told her. 
“You’re a great one for escape, 
aren’t you? First suicide, now 
this. What next?” 

“Go away.” 

“Probably religion. I can see 
you joining a cellar sect with 
passwords like Pax Vobiscum. 
Bible smuggling and martyrdom 
for the faith. Can’t you ever face 
up to anything?” 

“Don’t you ever run away?” 

“Escape is for cripples, neurot- 
ics.” 

“Neurotics. The favorite word 
of the Johnny-Come-Lately edu- 
cated. You’re so educated, aren’t 
you? So poised. So balanced. 
You’ve been running away all 
your life.” 

“Me? Never. I’ve been hunting 
all my life.” 

“You’ve been running. Haven’t 
you ever heard of Attack-Escape? 
To run away from reality by at- 
tacking it, denying it, destroying 
it? That’s what you’ve been do- 
ing.” 

F OYLE was brought up with a 
jolt. “Attack-Escape? You 
mean I’ve been running away 
from something?” 

“Obviously.” 

“From what?” 

“You can’t accept life as it is. 
You refuse. You attack it, try to 

121 



force it into your own pattern. 
You attack and destroy every- 
thing that stands in the way of 
your own insane pattern.” She 
lifted her tear-stained face. “I 
can’t stand it any more. I want 
you to let me go.” 

“What about your family?” 
“And find them my own way.” 
“Why? What now?” 

“It’s too much, you and the war, 
because you’re as bad as the war. 
Worse. What happened to me to- 
night is what happens to me every 
moment I’m with you. I can stand 
one or the other, not both.” 
“No,” he said. “I need you.” 
“I’m prepared to buy my way 
out.” 

“How?” 

“You’ve lost all your leads to 
Vorga, haven’t you?” 

“And?” 

“I’ve found another.” 

“Where?” 

“Never mind where. Will you 
agree to let me go if I turn it 
over to you?” 

“I can take it from you.” 

“Go ahead, take it.” Her eyes 
flashed. “If you know what it is, 
you won’t have any trouble.” 

“I can make you give it to me.” 
“Can you? After the bombing 
tonight? Try.” 

He was taken aback by her de- 
fiance. “How do I know you’re 
not bluffing?” 

“I’ll give you one hint. Remem- 
ber the man in Australia?” 



“Forrest?” 

“Yes. He tried to tell you the 
names of the crew. Do you re- 
member the only name he got 
out?” 

“Kemp.” 

“He died before he could finish 
it. The name is Kempsey.” 
“That’s your lead?” 

“Yes. Name and address. In re- 
turn for your promise to let me 
go.” 

“It’s a sale,” he said. “You can 
go. Give it to me.” 

S HE went at once to the travel 
dress she had worn in Shang- 
hai. From the pocket, she took 
out a sheet of partially burned 
paper. 

“I saw this on Sergei Orel’s 
desk when I was trying to put the 
fire out — the fire the Burning 
Man started.” 

She handed him the sheet of 
paper. It was a fragment of a beg- 
ging letter. It read: 

do anything to get out of these bac- 
teria fields. Why should a man just 
because he can’t jaunte get treated 
like a dog? Please help me, Serg. 
Help an old shipmate off a ship we 
don’t mention. You can spare Cr 100. 
Remember all the favors I done 
you? Send Cr 100 or even Cr 50. 
Don’t let me down.

“By God!” Foyle exclaimed. 
“This is the lead! We can’t fail 
this time. He’ll spill everything — 
everything!” He grinned at Robin. 
“We leave for the Moon tomor- 
row night. Book passage. No, 
there’ll be trouble on account of 
the attack. Buy a ship. They’ll be 
unloading them cheap enough, 
anyway.” 

“We?” Robin said. “You mean 
you.” 

“We’re going to the Moon. 
Both of us.” 

“I’m leaving.” 

“You’re not leaving. You’re 
staying with me.” 

“But you swore you’d — ” 

“Grow up, girl. I had to swear 
to anything to get this. I need you 
more than ever now. Not for 
Vorga. I’ll handle Vorga myself. 
For something much more impor- 
tant.” 

He looked at her incredulous 
face and smiled ruefully. “If you’d 
given me this letter two hours 
ago, I’d have kept my word. But 
it’s too late now. I need a Ro- 
mance Secretary. I’m in love with 
Olivia Presteign.” 

She leaped to her feet in a 
blaze of fury. “Yotfre in love 
with her? Olivia Presteign? In 
love with that white corpse!” The 
bitter fury of her telesending was 
a startling revelation to him. “Ah, 
now you have lost me. Forever. 
Now I’ll destroy you!” 

She disappeared. 



/^APTAIN Peter Y’ang- Yeovil 
^ was handling reports at Cen- 
tral Intelligence Hq. in London 
at the rate of six per minute. In- 
formation was phoned in, wired 
in, cabled in, jaunted in. The 
bombardment picture unfolded 
rapidly. 

ATTACK SATURATED N & S 
AMERICA FROM 60 ° TO 120 ° WEST 
LONGITUDE . LABRADOR TO 
ALASKA IN N . RIO TO ECUADOR 
IN S . ESTIMATED TEN PER CENT 
( 10 %) MISSILES PENETRATED IN- 
TERCEPTION SCREEN . ESTI- 
MATED POPULATION LOSS: TEN TO 
TWELVE MILLIONS . 

“If it wasn’t for jaunting,” 
Y’ang- Yeovil said, “the losses 
would have been five times that. 
All the same, it’s close to a knock- 
out. One more punch like that 
and Terra’s finished.” 

He addressed this to the assis- 
tants jaunting in and out of his 
office, appearing and disappear- 
ing, dropping reports on his desk 
and chalking results and equa- 
tions on the glass blackboard that 
covered one entire wall. Infor- 
mality was the rule and Y’ang- 
Yeovil was surprised and suspi- 
cious when an assistant knocked 
on his door and entered with 
elaborate formality. 

“What larceny now?” he asked. 
“Lady to see you, Yeo.” 

“Is this the time for comedy?” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



123 



Y’ang- Yeovil said in exasperated 
tones. He pointed to the White- 
head equations spelling disaster 
on the transparent blackboard. 
“Read that and weep on the way 
out.” 

“Very special lady, Yeo. Your 
Venus from the Spanish Stairs.” 
“Who? What Venus?” 

“Your Congo Venus.” 

“Oh, that one.” Y’ang- Yeovil 
hesitated. “Send her in.” 

“You’ll interview her in pri- 
vate, of course.” 

“Of course nothing. There’s a 
war on. Keep those reports com- 
ing, but tip everybody to switch 
to Secret Speech if they have to 
talk to me.” 

Robin Wednesbury entered the 
office, still wearing the torn white 
evening gown. She had jaunted 
without bothering to change. Her 
face was strained but lovely. 
Y’ang-Yeovil gave her a split- 
second inspection and realized 
that his first appreciation of her 
had not been mistaken. Robin 
returned the inspection and her 
eyes dilated. “But you’re the cook 
from the Spanish Stairs! Angelo 
Poggi!” 

A S AN Intelligence Officer, 
Y’ang-Yeovil was prepared 
to deal with this crisis. “Not a 
cook, madam. I haven’t had time 
to change back to my usual fasci- 
nating self. Please sit here, 
Miss . ?” 



“Wednesbury. Robin Wednes- 
bury.” 

“Charmed. I’m Captain Y’ang- 
Yeovil. How nice of you to come 
and see me. You’ve saved me a 
long, hard search.” 

“B-but I don’t understand. 
What were you doing on the 
Spanish Stairs? Why were you 
hunting-?” 

Y’ang-Yeovil saw that her lips 
weren’t moving. “Ah? You’re a 
telepath, Miss Wednesbury? How 
is that possible? I thought I knew 
every telepath in the Solar Sys- 
tem.” 

“I’m not a full telepath. I’m a 
telesend. I can only send, not re- 
ceive.” 

“Which, of course, makes you 
worthless to the world. I see.” 
Y’ang-Yeovil cocked a sympa- 
thetic eye at her. “What a dirty 
trick, Miss Wednesbury, to be 
saddled with all the disadvan- 
tages of telepathy and be de- 
prived of all the advantages. I do 
sympathize. Believe me.” 

“Bless him! He’s the first ever 
to realize that without being told.” 
“Careful, Miss Wednesbury, 
I’m receiving you. Now about the 
Spanish Stairs?” 

He paused, listening intently to 
her agitated telesending: “Why 
was he hunting? Me? Alien Bel- 
lig — Oh, God! Will they hurt me? 
Cut and — Information. I — ” 

“My dear girl,” Y’ang-Yeovil 
said gently, “listen to me a mo-

ment. You’re an Alien Belliger- 
ent?” 

She nodded. 

“That’s unfortunate, but we 
won’t worry about it now. About 
Intelligence cutting and slicing in- 
formation out of people — that’s 
all propaganda.” 

“Propaganda?” 

“We’re not maladroits, Miss 
Wednesbury. We know how to ex- 
tract information without being 
Medieval. But we spread the leg- 
end to soften people up in ad- 
vance, so to speak.” 

“Is that true? He’s lying. It’s a 
trick.” 

“It’s true, Miss Wednesbury. I 
do finesse, but there’s no need 
now. Not when you’ve evidently 
come of your own free will to 
offer information.” 

“He’s too adroit, too quick. 
He-” 

“You sound as though you’ve 
been badly tricked recently, Miss 
Wednesbury. Badly burned.” 

“I have. I have. By myself, 
mostly. I’m a fool. A hateful fool.” 
“Never a fool, Miss Wednes- 
bury, and never hateful. I don’t 
know what’s happened to shatter 
your opinion of yourself, but I 
hope to restore it. So you’ve been 
deceived, have you? By yourself, 
mostly? We all do that. But 
you’ve been helped by someone. 
Who?” 

“I’m betraying him.” 

“Then don’t tell me.” 



“But I’ve got to find my mother 
and sisters. I can’t trust him any 
more. I’ve got to do it myself.” 
Robin took a deep breath. “I want 
to tell you about a man named 
Gulliver Foyle.” 

Y’ang- Yeovil at once got down 
to business. 

S IT true he arrived by rail- 
road?” Olivia Presteign 
asked. “In a locomotive and obser- 
vation car? What wonderful au- 
dacity!” 

“Yes, he’s a remarkable young 
man,” Presteign answered. He 
stood, iron-gray and iron-hard, in 
the Reception Hall of his home, 
alone with his daughter. He was 
guarding honor and life while he 
waited for servants and staff to 
return from their panic-stricken 
jaunte to safety. He chatted im- 
perturbably with Olivia, never 
once permitting her to realize 
their grave danger. 

“Father, I’m exhausted.” 

“It’s been a trying night, my 
dear. But please don’t retire yet.” 
“Why not?” 

Presteign refrained from telling 
her that she would be safer with 
him. “I’m lonely, Olivia. We’ll talk 
for a few minutes.” 

“I did a daring thing, Father. I 
watched the attack from the gar- 
den.” 

“My dear! Alone?” 

“No. With Fourmyle.” 

A heavy pounding began to 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



125 



shake the front door which Pres- 
teign had closed. 

“What’s that?” 

“Looters,” Presteign answered 
calmly. “Don’t be alarmed, Olivia. 
They won’t get in.” He stepped to 
a table on which he had laid out 
an assortment of weapons as 
neatly as a game of patience. 
“There’s no danger, my love.” He 
tried to distract her. “You were 
telling me about Fourmyle — ” 
“Oh, yes. We watched together, 
describing the bombing to each 
other.” 

“Unchaperoned? That wasn’t 
discreet, Olivia.” 

“I know. I behaved disgrace- 
fully. He seemed so big, so sure of 
himself, that I gave him the Lady 
Hauteur treatment. He was furi- 
ous, Father. That’s why he came 
looking for me in the garden.” 
“And you permitted him to re- 
main? I’m shocked, dear.” 

“I am, too. I think I was half 
out of my mind with excitement. 
What’s he like, Father? Tell me. 
What does he look like to you?” 
“He is big. Tall, very dark, 
rather enigmatic. Like a Borgia. 
He seems to alternate between as- 
surance and savagery.” 

“I could see it myself. He glows 
with danger. Most people just 
shimmer; he looks like a light- 
ning bolt. It’s terribly fascinating.” 
“My dear,” Presteign remon- 
strated gently, “unmarried fe- 
males are too modest to talk like 

126 



that. It would displease me, my 
love, if you were to form a roman- 
tic attachment for a parvenu like 
Fourmyle of Ceres.” 

r T , HE Presteign staff jaunted 
into the Reception Hall, cooks, 
waitresses, footmen, pages, coach- 
men, valets, maids. All were 
shaken and hang-dog after their 
flight from death. 

“You have deserted your posts. 
It will be remembered,” Presteign 
said coldly. “My safety and honor 
are again in your hands. Guard 
them. Lady Olivia and I will re- 
tire.” 

He took his daughter’s arm 
and led her up the stairs, fiercely 
protective of his ice-pure princess. 
“Blood and money,” Presteign 
murmured. 

“What, Father?” 

“I was thinking of a family vice, 
Olivia. I was thanking fortune 
that you have not inherited it.” 
“What vice is that?” 

“There’s no need for you to 
know. It’s one that Fourmyle 
shares.” 

“Like a Borgia, you said. A 
wicked Borgia with black eyes 
and lines in his face. That must 
account for the pattern.” 
“Pattern, my dear?” 

“Yes. I can see a strange pat- 
tern over his face — not the usual 
electricity of nerve and muscle. 
Something laid over that. It fasci- 
nated me from the beginning.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“What sort of pattern do you 
mean?” 

“Fantastic. Wonderfully evil. I 
can’t describe it. Give me some- 
thing to write with. I’ll show you.” 
They stopped before a six-hun- 
dred-year-old Chippendale cabi- 
net. Presteign took out a silver- 
mounted slab of crystal and 
handed it to Olivia. She touched 
it with her fingertip; a black dot 
appeared. She moved her finger 
and the dot elongated into a line. 
With quick strokes, she sketched 
the hideous swirls and blazons of 
a Maori devil-mask. 

CAUL DAGENHAM left the 
^ darkened bedroom. A mo- 
ment later, it was flooded with 
light as one wall illuminated. It 
seemed as though a giant mirror 
reflected Jisbella’s bedroom, but 
with one odd quirk. Jisbella lay 
in the bed alone, but in the reflec- 
tion Saul Dagenham sat on the 
edge of the bed alone. The mirror 
was, in fact, a sheet of lead glass 
separating identical rooms. Dag- 
enham had just illuminated his. 

“Love by the clock.” Dagen- 
ham’s voice came through a 
speaker. “Disgusting.” 

“No, Saul. Never.” 
“Frustrating.” 

“Not that, either,” she said. 
“But unhappy.” 

“No. You’re greedy. Be content 
with what you’ve got.” 

“It’s more than I ever had. 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



You’re truly magnificent, Saul.” 
“You’re extravagant. Now go 
to sleep, darling. We’re skiing to- 
morrow.” 

“There’s been a change of plan. 
I’ve got to work.” 

“Oh, Saul, you promised me! 
No more working and fretting and 
running. Aren’t you going to keep 
your promise?” 

“I can’t with a war on.” 

“You sacrificed enough in that 
radioactive accident up at Tycho 
Sands. They can’t ask any more 
of you.” 

“I’ve got one job to finish.” 

“I’ll help you finish it.” 

“No. You’d best keep out of 
this, Jisbella.” 

“You don’t trust me.” 

“I don’t want you hurt.” 
“Nothing can hurt us.” 

“Foyle can.” 

“W-what?” she stammered. 
“Fourmyle is Foyle. You know 
that. I know you know.” 

“But I never — ” 

“No, you never told me. I said 
you’re magnificent. Keep faith 
with me the same way, Jisbella.” 
“Then how did you find out?” 
“Foyle slipped.” 

“How?” 

“The name.” 

“Fourmyle of Ceres? He bought 
the Ceres company.” 

“But Geoffrey Fourmyle?” 

“He invented it.” 

“Geoffrey Fourmyle is the name 
they use in the Megalomania Test 

127 



down in Combined Hospital in 
Mexico City. I used the Megal 
Mood on Foyle when I tried to 
open him up. The name stayed 
buried in his memory. He dredged 
it up and throught it was origi- 
nal.” 

“Poor Gully.” 

Dagenham smiled. “There’s no 
defense against betrayal, and we 
all betray ourselves.” 

“What are you going to do, 
Saul?” 

“Do? Finish him, of course.” 
“For twenty pounds of PyrE?” 
“No. To win a lost war.” 
“What?” Jisbella came to the 
glass wall separating the rooms. 
“You, Saul? Patriotic?” 

He nodded almost guiltily. 
“You’ve changed me. I’m a sane 
man again.” 

He pressed his face to the wall, 
too, and they kissed through three 
inches of lead glass. 

ly/fARE NUBIUM was ideally 
-*-*-*- suited to the growth of anae- 
robic bacteria, soil organisms, 
phage, rare molds and all those 
microscopic life-forms, essential 
to medicine and industry, which 
required airless culture. Bacteria, 
Inc., was a huge mosaic of culture 
fields traversed by catwalks 
spread around a central clump of 
barracks, offices and factory. Each 
field was a giant glass vat, one 
hundred feet in diameter, twelve 
inches high and no more than two 

128 



molecules thick at any point. 

A day before the sunrise line, 
creeping across the face of the 
Moon, reached Mare Nubium, the 
vats were filled with culture me- 
dium. At sunrise, abrupt and 
blinding on the airless Moon, the 
vats were seeded, and for the next 
fourteen days of continuous Sun, 
they were tended, shielded, regu- 
lated, nurtured, the field-workers 
trudging up and down the cat- 
walks in spacesuits. As the sunset 
line crept toward Mare Nubium, 
the vats were harvested and then 
left to freeze and sterilize in the 
two-week frost of the Lunar night. 

Jaunting was of no use in this 
tedious step-by-step cultivation. 
Hence Bacteria, Inc., hired un- 
fortunates incapable of jaunting 
and paid them slave wages. This 
was the lowest form of labor, the 
dregs and scum of the Solar Sys- 
tem; and the barracks of Bacteria, 
Inc., resembled an Inferno during 
the two-week layoff period. Foyle 
discovered this when he entered 
Barracks 3. 

He was met by an appalling 
spectacle. There were two hun- 
dred men in the giant room; there 
were whores and their hard-eyed 
pimps, professional gamblers and 
their portable tables, dope-ped- 
dlers, money-lenders. There was 
a haze of acrid smoke and the 
stench of alcohol and Analogue. 
Furniture, bedding, clothes, un- 
conscious bodies, empty bottles, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rotting food were scattered on the 
floor. 

A roar challenged Foyle’s ap- 
pearance, but he was equipped to 
handle this situation. He spoke to 
the first hairy face thrust into his. 

“Kempsey?” he asked quietly. 
He was answered outrageously. 
Nevertheless he grinned and 
handed the man a Cr 100 note. 
“Kempsey?” he asked another. He 
was insulted. He paid again and 
continued his saunter down the 
barracks distributing Cr 100 
notes in calm thanks for insult 
and invective. 

In the center of the room, he 
found his key man, the obvious 
barracks bully, a monster of a 
man, hairless, fondling two bawds 
and being fed whiskey by syco- 
phants. 

“Kempsey, you?” Foyle asked 
in the old gutter tongue. “I’m dig- 
gin’ Rodger Kempsey.” 

“Diggin’ you for broke, me,” the 
man answered, thrusting out a 
huge paw for Foyle’s money. 
“Gimme.” 

^ 1 1 HERE was a delighted howl 
from the crowd. Foyle smiled 
and spat in his eye. There was an 
abject hush. The hairless man 
dumped the bawds and surged up 
to annihilate Foyle. Five seconds 
later, he was groveling on the 
floor. 

“Still diggin’ Kempsey,” Foyle 
said gently. “Diggin’ hard, man. 



You better finger him, man, or 
you’re gone, is all.” 

“Washroom!” the hairless man 
howled. “Holed up. Washroom.” 
“Now you broke me,” Foyle 
said. He dumped the rest of his 
money on the floor before the 
hairless man and walked quickly 
to the washroom. 

Kempsey was cowering in the 
corner of a shower, face pressed 
to the wall, moaning in a dull 
rhythm that showed he had been 
at it for hours. 

“Kempsey?” 

The moaning answered him. 
“What’s a matter, you?” 
“Clothes,” Kempsey wept. “All 
over, clothes. Like filth, like sick, 
like dirt. Clothes. All over, 
clothes.” 

“Up, man. Get up.” 

“Clothes. All over, clothes. Like 
filth, like sick, like dirt . .” 

“Kempsey, mind me, man. Orel 
sent me.” 

Kempsey stopped weeping and 
turned his sodden countenance to 
Foyle. “Who? Who?” 

“Sergei Orel sent me. I’ve 
bought your release. You’re free. 
We’ll blow.” 

“When?” 

“Now.” 

“God bless him. Bless him!” 
Kempsey began to caper in weary 
exultation. The bruised and 
bloated face split into a facsimile 
of laughter. He laughed and ca- 
pered and Foyle led him out of

the washroom. But in the bar- 
racks, he screamed and wept 
again, and as Foyle led him down 
the long room, the bawds swept 
up armfuls of dirty clothes and 
shook them before his eyes. 
Kempsey foamed and gibbered. 

“What’s a matter, him?” Foyle 
inquired of the hairless man in 
the gutter patois. 

The hairless man was now a 
respectful neutral, if not a friend. 
“Guesses for grabs. Always like 
that, him. Show old clothes and 
he twitch. Man!” 

“For why, already?” 

“For why? Crazy, is all.” 

At the main-office airlock, Foyle 
got Kempsey and himself corked 
in suits and then led him out to 
the rocket field where a score of 
anti-grav beams pointed their 
pale fingers upward from pits to 
the gibbous Earth hanging in the 
night sky. They descended a pit, 
entered Foyle’s yawl and un- 
corked. 

Foyle took a bottle and a sting- 
ampule from a cabinet. He 
poured a drink and handed it to 
Kempsey. He hefted the ampule 
in his palm, smiling. 

TZ" EMPSEY drank the whiskey, 
still dazed, still exulting. 
“Free! God bless him! Free! You 
don’t know what I’ve been 
through.” He drank again. “I still 
can’t believe it. It’s like a dream. 
Why don’t you take off, man? I — ” 

130 



Kempsey choked and dropped 
the glass, staring at Foyle in hor- 
ror. “Your face! What happened 
to it?” 

“You happened to it, you son 
of a bitch!” Foyle leaped up, his 
tiger-face burning, and flung the 
ampule like a knife. It pierced 
Kempsey’s neck and hung quiv- 
ering. Kempsey toppled. 

Foyle accelerated, blurred to 
the body, picked it up in mid-fall 
and carried it aft to the starboard 
stateroom. There were two main 
staterooms in the yawl and Foyle 
had prepared both in advance. 
The starboard room had been 
stripped and turned into a sur- 
gery. Foyle strapped the body on 
the operating table, opened a case 
of surgical instruments, and began 
the delicate operation he had 
learned by hypno-training that 
morning— an operation made pos- 
sible only by his five-to-one accel- 
eration. 

He cut through skin and fascia, 
sawed through the rib cage, ex- 
posed the heart, snipped it out 
and connected veins and arteries 
to the intricate blood-pump along- 
side the table. He started the 
pump. Twenty seconds, objective 
time, had elapsed. He placed an 
oxygen mask over Kempsey’s face 
and switched on the alternating 
suction and eructation of the oxy- 
gen pump. 

Foyle decelerated, checked 
Kempsey’s temperature, shot an

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



131 



anti-shock series into his veins 
and waited. Blood gurgled 
through the pump and Kempsey’s 
body. After five minutes, Foyle 
removed the oxygen mask. The 
respiration reflex continued. 
Kempsey was without a heart, yet 
alive. Foyle sat down alongside 
the operating table and waited. 
The stigmata still showed on his 
face. 

Kempsey awoke, screaming. 
Foyle leaped up, tightened the 
straps and leaned over the heart- 
less man. 

“Look at yourself, Kempsey. 
You’re dead.” 

Kempsey fainted. Foyle brought 
him to with the oxygen mask. 
“Let me die, for God’s sake!” 
“I died for six months and I 
didn’t whine.” 

“Let me die!” 

“In time, Kempsey. Your sym- 
pathetic block’s been by-passed, 
but I’ll let you die in time, if you 
behave. You were aboard Vorga 
on September 16th, 2436?” 

“For Christ’s sake, let me die!” 
“You were aboard Vorga?” 
“Yes.” 

6£'V7’ OU passed a wreck out in 
space,” Foyle pressed on. 
“Wreck of the Nomad. She sig- 
naled for help and you passed her 
by. Yes?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why?” 

“Oh, Christ help me!” 



“I was aboard Nomad, Kemp- 
sey. Why did you leave me to 
rot?” 

“Sweet Jesus, help me! Christ, 
deliver me!” 

“I’ll deliver you, Kempsey, if 
you answer questions. Why did 
you leave me to rot?” 

“Couldn’t pick you up.” 

“Why not?” 

“Reffs aboard.” 

“I guessed right, then. You were 
running refugees in from Cal- 
listo?” 

“Yes.” 

“How many?” 

“Six hundred.” 

“That’s a lot, but you could 
have made room for one more. 
Why didn’t you pick me up?” 
“We were scuttling the reffs.” 
“What!” Foyle cried. 
“Overboard ... all of them . 
six hundred. Stripped ’em . took 
their clothes, money, jewels, bag- 
gage . put ’em through the air- 
lock in batches. Christ! The 
clothes all over the ship . the 
shrieking and the —Jesus! If I 
could only forget! The naked peo- 
ple . blue . busting wide open 
. spinning behind us. The 
clothes all over the ship. Six hun- 
dred. Scuttled!” 

“You bastard! It was a racket? 
You took their money and never 
intended bringing them to Earth?” 
“It was a racket.” 

“And that’s why you didn’t pick 
me up?”

“Would have had to scuttle 
you, anyway.” 

“Who gave the order?” 
“Captain.” 

“Name?” 

“Joyce. Lindsey Joyce.” 
“Address?” 

“Skoptsy Colony, Mars.” 

Foyle was thunderstruck. “He’s 
a Skoptsy? You mean after hunt- 
ing him for a year, I can’t touch 
him, hurt him, make him feel 
what I felt?” He turned away 
from the tortured man on the 
table, equally tortured himself by 
frustration. “A Skoptsy! The one 
thing I never figured on! After 
preparing that port stateroom for 
him — what am I going to do? 
What in God’s name am I going 
to do?” he roared in fury, the 
stigmata showing livid on his face. 

TT E WAS recalled by a desper- 
ate moan from Kempsey. He 
returned to the table. “Let’s get it 
straight for the last time. This 
Skoptsy, Lindsey Joyce, gave the 
order to scuttle the reffs?” 

“Yes.” 

“And to let me rot?” 

“Yes. Yes. Yes! That’s enough! 
Let me die!” 

“Live, you filthy, heartless 
slaughterer! Live without a heart. 
Live and suffer. I’ll keep you alive 
forever, you — ” 

A lurid flash of light caught 
Foyle’s eye. He looked up. His 
burning image was staring through 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



the large square porthole of the 
stateroom. As he leaped to the 
porthole, the Burning Man disap- 
peared. 

Foyle left the stateroom and 
darted forward to main controls 
where the observation bubble 
gave him two hundred and sev- 
enty degrees of vision. The Burn- 
ing Man was nowhere in sight. 

“It’s not real,” he muttered. “It 
couldn’t be real. It’s a sign, a good 
luck sign — a Guardian Angel. It 
saved me on the Spanish Stairs. 
It’s telling me to go ahead and 
find Lindsey Joyce.” 

He strapped himself into the 
pilot chair, ignited the yawl’s jets 
and slammed into full accelera- 
tion. 

“Lindsey Joyce, Skoptsy Col- 
ony, Mars,” he thought as he was 
thrust back deep into the pneu- 
matic chair. “A Skoptsy . with- 
out senses, without pleasure, with- 
out pain. The ultimate in Stoic 
escape. How am I going to put 
him in the port stateroom and 
make him feel what I felt aboard 
Nomad? Damnation! It’s as 
though he’s dead. He is dead. And 
I’ve got to figure how to whip a 
dead body and make it feel pain. 
To come so close to the end and 
have the door slammed in your 
face. The damnable frustra- 
tion of revenge. Revenge is for 
dreams, never for reality.” 

An hour later, he released him- 
self from the acceleration and his 

133 



fury, unbuckled himself from the 
chair, and remembered Kempsey. 
He went aft to the surgery. The 
extreme acceleration of the take- 
off had choked the blood-pump. 
Kempsey was dead. Suddenly 
Foyle was overcome with a novel 
passionate revulsion for himself. 
He fought it helplessly. 

“What’s a matter, you?” he 
whispered. “Think of the six hun- 
dred, scuttled. Think of your- 
self. Are you turning into a 
white - livered Cellar - Christian 
turning the other cheek and whin- 
ing forgiveness? Olivia, what are 
you doing to me? Give me 
strength, not cowardice . .” 

Nevertheless, he averted his 
eyes as he scuttled the body.

priority! 

A FTER two centuries of coloni- 
zation, the air struggle on 
Mars was still so critical that the 
V-L Law, the Vegetative-Lynch 
Law, was still in effect. It was a 
killing offense to endanger or de- 
stroy any plant vital to the trans- 
formation of Mars’ carbon dioxide 
atmosphere into an oxygen atmos- 
phere. Even blades of grass were 
sacred. There was no need to 
erect keep off the grass neons. 
The man who wandered off a 
path onto a lawn would be in- 
stantly shot. So would the woman 
who picked a flower. Two centu- 
ries of sudden death had inspired 
a reverence for green growing 
things that almost amounted to a 
religion. 

Foyle remembered this as he 
raced up the center of the cause- 
way leading to Mars St. Michele. 
He had jaunted direct from the 
Syrtis airport to the St. Michele 
stage at the foot of the causeway, 
which stretched for a quarter of a 
mile through green fields to Mars 
St. Michele. The rest of the dis- 
tance had to be traversed on foot. 

Like the original Mont St. Mi- 
chele on the French coast, Mars 
St. Michele was a majestic Gothic 
cathedral of spires and buttresses 
looming on a hill and yearning 
toward the sky. Ocean tides sur- 
rounded Mont St. Michele on 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



Earth; green tides of grass sur- 
rounded Mars St. Michele. Both 
were fortresses. Mont St. Michele 
had been a fortress of faith before 
organized religion was abolished. 
Mars St. Michele was a fortress 
of telepathy. Within it lived Mars’, 
sole full telepath, Sigurd Mags- 
man. 

“Now these are the defenses 
protecting Sigurd Magsman,” 
Foyle chanted, halfway between 
hysteria and litany. “Firstly, the 
Solar System; secondly, Martial 
Law; thirdly, Dagenham-Presteign 
& Co.; fourthly, the fortress itself; 
fifthly, the uniformed guards, at- 
tendants, servants and admirers 
of the bearded sage we all know 
so well, Sigurd Magsman, selling 
his awesome powers for awesome 
prices . .” 

Foyle laughed immoderately: 
“But there’s a sixthly that I know: 
Sigurd Magsman’s Achilles’ Heel. 
I’ve paid Cr. 1,000,000 to Sigurd 
the Illrd ... or was he the IVth?” 

He passed through the outer 
labyrinth of Mars St. Michele 
with his forged credentials and 
was tempted to bluff or proceed 
directly by Commando Action to 
an audience with the Great Man 
himself, but time was pressing 
and his enemies were closing in 
and he could not afford to satisfy 
his curiosity. Instead, he acceler- 
ated, blurred, and found a humble 
cottage set in a walled garden 
within the Mars St. Michele home 

135 



farm. It had drab windows and a 
thatched roof and might have 
been mistaken for a stable. 

Foyle slipped inside. 

’ 1 1 HE cottage was a nursery. 
-*• Three pleasant nannies sat 
motionless in rocking chairs, knit- 
ting poised in their frozen hands. 
The blur that was Foyle came up 
behind them and quietly stung 
them with ampules. Then he de- 
celerated. He looked at the an- 
cient, ancient child, the wizened, 
shriveled boy who was seated on 
the floor playing with electronic 
trains. 

“Hello, Sigurd,” Foyle said. 
The child began to cry. 

“What are you afraid of? I’m 
not going to hurt you.” 

“You’re a bad man with a bad 
face.” 

“I’m your friend, Sigurd.” 

“No, you’re not. You want me 
to do h-had things.” 

“I’m your friend. Look, I know 
all about those big hairy men who 
pretend to be you, but I won’t tell. 
Read me and see.” 

“You’re going to hurt him and 
y-you want me to tell him.” 
“Who?” 

“The captain-man. The Ski — 
Shot—” The child fumbled with 
the word, wailing louder. “Go 
away. You’re bad. Badness in 
your head and burning mens 
and—” 

“Come here, Sigurd.” 



“No. NANNIE! NAN-N-I-E!” 
“Shut up, you little monster!” 
Foyle grabbed the seventy-year- 
old child and shook it. “This is 
going to be a brand-new experi- 
ence for you, Sigurd. The first 
time you’ve ever been walloped 
into anything. Understand?” 

The ancient child read him and 
howled. 

“We’re going on a trip to the 
Skoptsy Colony. If you behave 
yourself and do what you’re told, 
I’ll bring you back safe and give 
you a lolly or whatever the hell 
they bribe you with. If you don’t 
behave, I’ll beat the living day- 
lights out of you.” 

“No, you won’t. You won’t! I’m 
Sigurd the telepath. You wouldn’t 
dare.” 

“Sonny, I’m Gully Foyle, Solar 
Enemy Number One. I’m just a 
step away from the finish of a 
year-long hunt, risking my neck 
because I need you to settle ac- 
counts with a son of a bitch who — 
Sonny, I’m Gully Foyle. There 
isn’t anything I wouldn’t dare.” 
The telepath began broadcast- 
ing terror with such an uproar 
that alarms sounded all over 
Mars St. Michele. Foyle took a 
firm grip on the ancient child, ac- 
celerated, and carried him out of 
the fortress. Then he jaunted.

r | 1 HE ancient Skoptsy sect of 
White Russia, believing that 
sex was the root of all evil, prac- 
ticed an atrocious self-castration 
to extirpate the root. The modern 
Skoptsys, believing that sensation 
was the root of all evil, practiced 
an even more barbaric custom. 
Having entered the Skoptsy Col- 
ony and paid a fortune for the 
privilege, the initiates submitted 
joyously to an operation that sev- 
ered the sensory nervous system, 
and lived out their days without 
sight, sound, speech, smell, taste 
or touch. 

When they first entered the 
bastardized monastery, the initi- 
ates were shown elegant ivory 
cells in which it was intimated 
they would spend the remainder 
of their lives in rapt contempla- 
tion, lovingly tended. In actuality, 
the senseless creatures were 
packed in rock cells where they 
sat on rough stone slabs and were 
fed and exercised once a day. For 
twenty-three out of twenty-four 
hours, they sat alone in the dark, 
untended, unguarded, unloved. 

“The living dead,” Foyle mut- 
tered. He decelerated, put Sigurd 
Magsman down and switched on 
the retinal light in his eyes, trying 



to pierce the womb-gloom. It was 
midnight above ground. It was 
permanent midnight down in 
these womb-tombs. Sigurd Mags- 
man was broadcasting terror and 
anguish with such a telepathic 
bray that Foyle was forced to 
shake the child again. 

“Shut up!” he whispered. “You 
can’t wake these dead. Now find 
me Lindsey Joyce.” 

The child whimpered. 

“They’re sick ... all sick . 
worms in their heads and sickness 
and — ” 

“Christ, don’t I know it! Come 
on, let’s get it over with. There’s 
worse to come.” 

They went down the twisting 
labyrinth of the catacombs. The 
stone slabs shelved the walls from 
floor to ceiling. The Skoptsys, 
white as slugs, mute as corpses, 
motionless as Buddhas, filled the 
caverns with the odor of vegeta- 
tive life. The telepathic child 
wept and shrieked. Foyle never 
relaxed his relentless grip, never 
relaxed the hunt. 

“Johnson, Wright, Keeley, Graff, 
Nastro, Underwood . there’s 
thousands here!” Foyle read off 
the bronze identification plates at- 
tached to the slabs. “Reach out, 
Sigurd. Find Lindsey Joyce for 
me. We can’t go over them name 
by name. Regal, Cone, Brady, 
Vincent— What in the name of 
God!” 

Sigurd screamed. 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION

t'OYLE started back. One of 
-®- the bone-white figures had 
cuffed his brow. It was swaying 
and writhing, its face twitching. 
All the white slugs on their 
shelves were squirming and 
writhing. Sigurd Magsman’s con- 
stant telepathic broadcast of an- 
guish and terror was reaching 
them and torturing them. 

“Stop it!” Foyle snapped. “Find 
Lindsey Joyce and we’ll get out 
of here. Reach out and find him.” 
“Down there.” Sigurd wept. 
“Straight down there. Seven, eight, 
nine shelves down. I want to go 
home. I’m sick. I 

Foyle, went pell-mell down the 
catacombs with Sigurd, reading 
off identification plates until at 
last he came to: “lindsey Joyce. 
BOUGAINVILLE. VENUS.” 

This was his enemy, the insti- 
gator of his death and the deaths 
of the six hundred from Callisto. 
This was the enemy for whom he 
had planned vengeance and had 
prepared the agony of the port 
stateroom aboard his yawl. 

This was Vorga. 

It was a woman. 

Foyle gaped in shock. In these 
days of the double standard, with 
women kept in purdah, there 
were many reported cases of 
women masquerading as men to 
enter the worlds closed to them, 
but he had never yet heard of a 
woman in the merchant marine, 
masquerading her way to the top. 

138 



“This?” he exclaimed furiously. 
“This is Lindsey Joyce? Lindsey 
Joyce off the Vorga? Ask her.” 

“I don’t know what Vorga is.” 
“Ask her!” 

“But I don’t — She was— She 
like gave orders.” 

“Captain?” 

“I don’t like what’s inside her. 
It’s all sick and dark. It hurts. I 
want to go home.” 

“Ask her. Was she captain of 
the Vorga?” 

“Yes. Please, please, please 
don’t make me go inside her any 
more. It’s twisty and hurts. I don’t 
like her.” 

“Tell her I’m the man she 
wouldn’t pick up on September 
16th, 2436. Tell her it’s taken a 
long time, but I’ve finally come to 
settle the account. Tell her I’m 
going to pay her back.” 

“I d-don’t understand. Don’t 
understand.” 

“Tell her I’m going to kill her, 
slow and hard. Tell her I’ve got a 
stateroom aboard my yawl, fitted 
up just like my locker aboard 
Nomad where I rotted for six 
months . where she ordered 
Vorga to leave me to die. Tell her 
she’s going to rot and die just like 
me. Tell her!” Foyle shook the 
wizened child furiously. “Make 
her feel it. Don’t let her get away 
by turning Skoptsy. Tell her I kill 
her filthy. Read me and tell her!” 
“She — sh-she didn’t give that 
order.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“She what?” 

“I c-can’t understand her.” 
“She didn’t give the order to 
scuttle me?” 

“I’m afraid to go in.” 

“Go in, you little monster, or 
I’ll take you apart. What does she 
mean?” 

r T"*HE child wailed; the woman 
writhed; Foyle fumed. “Go in! 
Go in! Get it out of her! Jesus, 
why does the only telepath on 
Mars have to be a child? Sigurd! 
Sigurd, listen to me. Ask her: Did 
she give the order to scuttle the 
reffs?” 

“No. No!” 

“No, she didn’t, or no, you 
won’t?” 

“She didn’t.” 

“Did she give the order to pass 
Nomad by?” 

“She’s twisty and sicky. Oh, 
please! NAN-N-I-E! I want to go 
home. Want to go.” 

“Did she give the order to pass 
Nomad by?” 

“No. Take me home.” 

“Ask her who did!” roared 
Gully Foyle. 

“I want my Nannie.” 

“Ask her who could give her 
an order. She was captain aboard 
her own ship. Who could com- 
mand her? Ask her!” 

“No. No. No. I’m afraid. She’s 
sick. She’s bad. I don’t understand 
her. I want my Nannie. I want to 
go home.” 



The child was shrieking and 
shaking; Foyle was shouting. As 
Foyle reached for the child in a 
rage, his eyes were blinded by 
brilliant light. The entire cata- 
comb was illuminated by the 
Burning Man. Foyle’s image 
stood before him, face hideous, 
clothes on fire, the blazing eyes 
fixed on the convulsing Skoptsy 
that had been Lindsey Joyce. 

The Burning Man opened his 
tiger mouth. A grating sound 
emerged. It was like flaming 
laughter. 

“She hurts,” he said. 

“Who are you?” Foyle whis- 
pered. 

The Burning Man winced. 
“Too bright,” he said. “Less light.” 

Foyle took a step forward. 

The Burning Man clapped 
hands over his ears in agony. 
“Too loud! Don’t move so loud.” 
Suddenly he laughed again. “Lis- 
ten to her. She’s screaming. Beg- 
ging. She doesn’t want to die. She 
doesn’t want to be hurt. Listen to 
her.” 

Foyle trembled. 

“She’s telling us who gave the 
order. Can’t you hear? Listen with 
your eyes.” The Burning Man 
pointed a talon finger at the 
writhing Skoptsy. “She says 
Olivia.” 

“What!” 

“Olivia Presteign. Olivia Pres- 
teign. Olivia Presteign.” 

The Burning Man vanished. 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION

The catacombs were dark 
again. 

Colored lights and cacophonies 
whirled around Foyle. He gasped 
and staggered. “Blue jaunte,” he 
muttered. “Olivia. No. Not. Never. 
Olivia. I-” 

He felt a hand reach for his. 

“Jiz?” he croaked. 

He became aware that Sigurd 
Magsman was holding his hand 
and weeping. He picked the boy 
up. 

“I hurt," Sigurd whimpered. 

“I hurt, too, son.” 

“Want to go home.” 

“I’ll take you home.” 

CTILL holding the boy in his 
^ arms, he blundered through 
the catacombs. 

“The living dead,” he mumbled. 
And then: “I’ve joined them.” 

He found the stone steps that 
led up from the depths to the 
monastery cloister above ground. 
He trudged up the steps, tasting 
death and desolation. There was 
bright light above him, and for a 
moment he imagined that dawn 
had come already. Then he real- 
ized that the cloister was bril- 
liantly lit with artificial light. 
There was the tramp of shod feet 
and the low growl of commands. 
Halfway up the steps, Foyle 
stopped and mustered himself. 

“Sigurd,” he whispered. “Who’s 
above us? Find out.” 

“Sojers,” the child answered. 



“Soldiers? What soldiers?” 

“Commando sojers.” Sigurd’s 
crumpled face brightened. “ They 
come for me. T o take me home to 
Nannie. HERE I AM! HERE I 
AM!” 

The telepathic clamor brought 
a shout from overhead. Foyle ac- 
celerated and blurred up the rest 
of the steps to the cloister. It was 
a square of Romanesque arches 
surrounding a green lawn. In the 
center of the lawn was a giant 
Cedar of Lebanon. The flagged 
walks swarmed with Commando 
search-parties and Foyle came 
face to face with his match, for, 
an instant after they saw his blur 
whip up from the catacombs, they 
accelerated, too, and all were on 
even terms. 

But Foyle had the boy. Shoot- 
ing was impossible. Cradling Si- 
gurd in his arms, he wove 
through the cloister like a broken- 
field runner hurtling toward a 
goal. No one dared block him, for 
at plus-five acceleration, a head- 
on collision between two bodies 
would be instantly fatal to both. 
Objectively, this break-neck skir- 
mish looked like a five-second zig- 
zag of lightning. 

Foyle broke out of the cloister, 
went through the main hall of the 
monastery, passed through the 
labyrinth and reached the public 
jaunte stage outside the main 
gate. There he stopped, deceler- 
ated and jaunted to the monas-

tery airfield, half a mile distant. 
The field was also ablaze with 
lights and swarming with Com- 
mandos. Every anti-grav pit was 
occupied by a Brigade ship. His 
own yawl was under guard. 

A fifth of a second after Foyle 
arrived at the field, the pursuers 
from the monastery jaunted in. 
He looked around desperately. 
He was surrounded by half a 
regiment of Commandos, all un- 
der acceleration, all geared for 
lethal action, all his equal or 
better. 

The odds were impossible. 

A ND then the Outer Satellites 
altered the odds. Exactly one 
week after the saturation raid on 
Terra, they struck at Mars. 

Again the missiles came down 
on the midnight-to-dawn quad- 
rant. Again the heavens twinkled 
with interceptions and detona- 
tions, and the horizon exploded 
great puffs of light while the 
ground shook. But this time there 
was a ghastly variation, for a bril- 
liant nova burst overhead, flood- 
ing the nightside of the planet 
with garish light. A swarm of fis- 
sion-heads had struck Mars’ tiny 
satellite, Phobos, instantly vapor- 
izing it into a sunlet. 

The Recognition Lag of the 
Commandos to this appalling at- 
tack gave Foyle his opportunity. 
He accelerated again and burst 
through them to his yawl. He

stopped before the main hatch 
and saw the stunned guard party 
hesitate between a continuance of 
the old action and a response to 
the new. 

Foyle hurled Sigurd Magsman 
up into the air like an ancient 
Scotsman tossing the caber. As 
the guard party rushed to catch 
the boy, Foyle dived through 
them into his yawl, slammed the 
hatch and dogged it. 

Still under acceleration, never 
pausing to see if anyone was in- 
side the yawl, he shot forward to 
controls, tripped the release lever 
and, as the yawl started to float 
up the anti-grav beam, threw on 
full 10-G propulsion. He was not 
strapped into the pilot chair. The 
effect of the 10-G drive on his ac- 
celerated and unprotected body 
was monstrous. 

A creeping force took hold of 
him and spilled him out of the 
chair. He inched back toward the 
rear wall of the control chamber 
like a sleepwalker. To his accel- 
erated senses, the wall appeared 
to approach him. He thrust out 
both arms, palms flat against the 
wall to brace himself. The slug- 
gish power thrusting him back 
jacked his arms apart and forced 
him against the wall, gently at 
first, then harder and harder until 
face, jaw, chest and, body were 
crushed against the metal. 

The mounting pressure became 
agonizing. He tried to trip the 

141 



switchboard in his mouth with his 
tongue, but the propulsion crush- 
ing him against the wall made it 
impossible for him to move his 
distorted mouth. 

A burst of explosions, so far 
down the sound spectrum that 
they sounded like sodden rock- 
slides, told him that the Com- 



mando Brigade was bombarding 
him with shots from below. 

As the yawl tore up into the 
blue-black of outer space, he be- 
gan to scream in a bat-screech 
that was snapped off by uncon- 
sciousness.

FORECAST 

Next month, Alfred Bester's THE STARS MY DESTINATION con- 
cludes with as explosive a climax as ever was achieved by any 
science fiction serial. Mull this volcanic concept: PyrE is power beyond 
Man's most fantastic dream . but Gully Foyle's Burning Man is a 
fantastic dream within Man's power! 

MORAL EQUIVALENT, a novelet by Kris Neville, asks a sen- 
sible question: Why shouldn't one culture imitate another culture right 
down to the last little detail? But the answer is a harrowing one: The 
last little detail may be just that— the final one! 

In the second and concluding installment of TRACKING DOWN 
THE "SEA SERPENT," Willy Ley systematically takes you to the end of 
a hunt that covers centuries and oceans and seas ... a hunt manned 
by trained observers, not charlatans or even landlubbers. Their de- 
tailed reports of what they saw may leave room for argument, but 
none whatever for doubt. As a case history of an age-old mystery, 
it is a brilliant presentation of evidence that would satisfy the most 
exacting judge. 

Short stories, of course, plus our regular features . plus a warm 
visit by our famous and beloved four-armed Santa Claus! Poor chap, 
he really has his hands full passing out gifts— take a look at the next 
page and see how you can help him out— while at the same time mak- 
ing grateful friends and saving money!

dishes made of it. The amount 
ultimately thrown out is very 
nearly the original weight. 

Any housewife who uses a laun- 
dromat will depose that the only 
way to get a laundry beneath the 
nine-pound load seems to be to 
send in an empty bag. 

When you move into an empty 
apartment, the amount of junk 
to be cleared out is beyond all 
reason or explanation, especially 
magazines and newspapers; a 
number of experimenters have 
found that these accumulate even 
when none are bought. 

There are many other exam- 
ples, but let’s examine the loss 
side of the ledger. 

You can tag your socks like 
migratory birds or staple them 
together, but however carefully 
you handle them, you will invar- 
iably wind up with a handful (or 
drawerful) of single socks. 

There is no known way of 
keeping your stock of handker- 
chiefs from steadily dwindling. 

Even if you make a point of 
not eating the canned foods you 
especially like, they are always 
gone when you want them. (There 
is an obverse: the ones you don’t 
like multiply.) 

Game is notorious for its shrink- 
age — fish lose weight and length 
from water to boat and still more 
from boat to home. The theory 
that this is because of fighting and 



exposure to air is untrue; if they 
escape the hook, they swiftly grow 
big again. 

No matter how many light 
bulbs of the right wattage you 
may buy, you usually have to 
settle for a 40 when a 100 blows. 

There is an inexplicable quan- 
titative difference between a 
quart of soda (or beer) and a 
quart of milk. 

When you break a shoe lace, 
the ones in the drawer will always 
be the wrong size and color. 

The books in your library are 
not the ones you bought. Sugar 
and coffee dribble away at the 
most awkward times. No one 
knows what happens to the linen 
for the guest room. 

There’s more, but this is enough 
to work with. Sinister? I thought 
so at first, but have you noticed 
how the ledger balances? Exas- 
peratingly, yes, but it does bal- 
ance: a sock for a pound of fat, 
canned Alberta peaches for never- 
ending roasts, old magazines and 
newspapers for light bulbs. 

Somewhere, it seems to me, 
there is a marketplace where such 
trades are considered equitable. 
I don’t know where and I have 
no idea how it’s done or what 
the profit is for the middleman, 
but I have a thoroughly grudg- 
ing respect for both traders and 
customers — they give fair value, 
at least by their standards.

Former Air Force Expert Reveals 

HUSHED-UP FACTS ON 

FLY/AfG SAVCSAS" 



Here is the first authoritative 
report on Unidentified Flying Objects 
— by the top man in charge of 
their official investigation! 



A RB “Plying Saucers” 
real? Are they interplan- 
etary spaceships manned by 
intelligent beings? THE RE- 
PORT ON UNIDENTIFIED 
FLYING OBJECTS discloses 
ALL the startling, hereto- 
fore “hushed-up” FACTS — 
and you can draw your own 
conclusions ! 

As chief of the Air Force 
project assigned to the in- 
vestigation and analysis of 
“UFO’s,” Edward J. Rup- 
pelt and his staff studied 
over .4, 500 reports — and dis- 
cussed them with everyone 
from out-and-out crackpots 



to top-level scientists and 
generals. 

All reports were subjected 
to military intelligence anal- 
ysis. Astronomers, physi- 
cists, aerodynamic engineers, 
and psychologists were con- 
sulted in the course of ex- 
haustive investigation. The 
official Air Technical Intelli- 
gence Center reports of their 
findings, many details of which 
are revealed for the first time 
in this book, contain some 
completely baffling accounts 
by thoroughly reliable wit- 
nesses — some of whom were 
expert scientists and military 
men!
