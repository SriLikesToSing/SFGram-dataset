The Satellite Vehicle 



SECOND OF TWO PARTS 

BY JAMES M. NUDING 

Lead Research Engineer y Atomic Research Energy and 
Problems of Instrumentation , North American Aviation 

WITH PAUL J. VANOUS 

Microwave Senior Design Engineer y Missile Guidance 
Systems Divisiony Bendix Aviation 



EDITOR'S NOTE: During the months in which the material for 
these two articles was undergoing painstaking preparationy a con- 
tinuouSy trickle of news, from various sources, has described bit by 
bit the actual development of the first Temporary Satellite as- 
semblies. Thus it becomes more and more clear, as each day passes, 
that almost all the vitally necessary advantages of the proposed 
Satellite vehicle, described by Mr. Nuding and Mr. Vanous, are 



4 




being by-passed in the designs of the 
vehicles actually readied for the 
LG.Y, program. 

The prime reason seems to be 
one of fanatic haste to get some-- 
thing, anything, off the ground and 
into space by late 1957 or early 
1958, as announced. The publicity 
and propaganda value of being first 
into space with any kind of satel- 
lite is immense, and an open- 
handed gesture of peaceful intent. 
However, the satellites are supposed 
to have a purpose, namely: the 
gathering of technical data on con- 
ditions of many kinds in the volume 
of space immediately surrounding 
the Earth. 

The editors of IF have felt, al- 
most from the opening announce- 
ment of Project Vanguard, that the 
very short time allowed for design, 
development and construction of 
the actual hardware to be fired pre- 
cluded any chance for the accom- 
plishment of the main purpose in 
anything more than a momentary 
fashion. 

Therefore, as long ago as Oc- 
tober, 1955, IF commissioned Mr. 
Nuding and Mr. Vanous to develop 
and describe a design for such a 
satellite assembly which would satis- 
factorily perform the task of gath- 
ering a complex assortment of 
spatial data, and stay in orbit for 
a long enough time to provide in- 
formation o/ maximum contribu- 
tion to the I.G.Y. 

We feel that Messrs. Nuding and 
Vanous, have accomplished a re- 
markable feat. The construction of 
each of the three rocket stages 
which they propose presents no 
really great problem that has not al- 



ready been under attack for a 
considerable time. Stage III, the 
actual Satellite, is a close adapta- 
tion of Aerobee. Stage II is a modi- 
fied Viking chassis, and Stage I 
presents dimensions and perform- 
ance that are not likely to be too 
far removed from the thoughts be- 
ing considered for our Intercon- 
tinental Ballistics Missile, Atlas. 

It is IF's conviction that — once 
scientific appetites are whetted by 
the intriguing, but inconclusive, re- 
sults of the first hasty shots of the 
I.G.Y. satellites — it is inevitable 
that the design of a vehicle much 
more similar to the one we here 
propose will follow. For instance, 
it has been recently announced that 
the I.G.Y. ^^birds^^ will be fired into 
an elliptical orbit of very high ec- 
centricity at an angle which belts 
the Earth more or less completely 
in its equatorial zone. This can only 
be, as Mr. Nuding and Mr. Vanous 
point out, because insufficient 
power is being utilized to provide 
that last thousand-miles-per-hour 
velocity necessary to overcome the 
EartWs rotational spin. Yet, the 
Equatorial orbit is a miserable com- 
promise from a whole spectrum of 
viewpoints, and such an orbital el- 
liptical eccentricity will allow only 
a scant few days of life for the 
^^bird^^ before burnup at perigee, be- 
cause of too deep re-entry into the 
upper atmosphere at that point 
every ninety minutes. 

There will be a bigger, more high 
flying ^^bird'' in a stable Polar orbit 
before too long, and the odds are 
excellent that it will be a substan- 
tial piece of respectable engineering 
— not a globule.

T he first article on this sub- 
ject {June IF) dealt briefly 
with Stages I and II of a desirable 
type of satellite vehicle for launch- 
ing during the forthcoming Geo- 
physical Year by the Defense De- 
partment of the United States. This 
article deals in detail with Stage 
III, and associated ground moni- 
toring stations of the Satellite vehi- 
cle. It will also discuss the possible 
orbits into which the Satellite might 
be put and the effect of these orbits 
on the information obtainable. 

Stages I and II, although they 
will be an engineering feat of prime 
importance, must be considered 
only as a means toward an end — a 
conveyance or elevator to raise the 
Satellite 300 miles above the sur- 
face of the Earth and accelerate it 
along the direction of its orbital 
path. Stage III, on the other hand, 
we see as a much more complicated 
device. It will be not only a rocket, 
complete with all the necessary fuel 
tanks, motor, guidance systems, etc., 
but it should also contain an elec- 
tric power source, radio gear for 
sending and receiving information 
to and from the earth; a gyro- 
stabilized platform, a navigation 
system, and a number of sensing 
instruments for the gathering of in- 
formation of interest to I.G.Y. 
scientists. 

We have tried to design a satel- 
lite that will give the maximum 
amount of information and justify 
the great expense of its manufac- 
ture and launching. It differs con- 
siderably from the current popular 
conception of what the satellite 
vehicle will be like. In fact, it dif- 
fers from what the first few satellites 

6 



may actually be like. In order to 
enclose the numerous devices men- 
tioned in the preceding paragraph, 
it would have to be a rocket at 
least as large as the Aerobee. The 
Aerobee is 19 feet long and 15 
inches in diameter. 

Whereas the Aerobee was de- 
signed to carry a 150 lb. payload to 
an altitude of approximately 70 
miles, the instrumented third stage 
of the proposed satellite would be 
carried by the second stage to near 
the altitude of the desired orbit, 
and have imparted to it by the sec- 
ond stage, nearly all of the 17,400 
miles per hour velocity necessary to 
keep it there. All that would be re- 
quired of the rocket propulsion 
system of the Satellite itself would 
be a sufficient number of short- 
duration impulses to make final 
and continuing corrections to the 
Satellite’s orbit. This means that 
tankage and fuel load could be 
small, leaving room for the large 
bulk of desired instrumentation. 



I N CHOOSING an orbit for a 
satellite, one must consider the 
economics of the situation. If the 
cost of the venture is to be the de- 
ciding factor, then the satellite 
should be launched at or near the 
equator, in the direction of the 
Earth’s rotation. This allows one 
to take advantage of the 1000 miles 
per hour rotational velocity which 
the surface of the Earth has at the 
equator. This would considerably 
decrease the load of fuel necessary 
to bring the satellite to its orbital 
velocity, of approximately 17,400 
mph. The size of both Stages I 

JAMES M. NUDING 




and II would thus be reduced, mak- be scanty and inadequate, but ob- 
ing the whole project of a size more servers on the ground would be 
consistent with present day rocket working under great terrestrial dif- 
technology. Acuities. 

Balanced against this gain, how- The ideal orbit, informationwise, 
ever, is the fact that such an orbit would be one that circles the Earth 
would probably give less informa- from pole to pole, which nullifies 
tion about the Earth and the upper velocity imparted by the rotation 
atmosphere than any other orbit of the Earth. In this way, the plane 
that could be chosen. Two of the of the orbit would be fixed with re- 
most interesting bits of knowledge, spect to a point in space, and the 
which it is hoped the satellite will Earth would rotate under the satel- 
contribute, concern the magnetic lite while it moved along lines of 
field of the Earth and the Auroral equal longtitude with respect to the 
lights. Both of these phenomena Earth. This would allow the satel- 
are concentrated at or near the lite to scan every bit of the Earth’s 
poles. A satellite orbiting around surface every 24 hours. Actually, 
the equator would not be able to for the purpose of the Satellite 
get much if anything of value on Vehicle we have in mind, it would 
either of these. A further argument be ideal if the orbit were inclined 
against an Equatorial orbit is the 23 degrees from the axis of the 
fact that only a very narrow band Earth’s rotation. This would allow 
of territory on each side of the the satellite to follow the twilight 
equator, mostly jungle and water, zone of the Earth, in the greater 
would be scanned by the satellite, part of a year, at least. The ad- 
Thus, not only would information vantage of this would be that the 




7 




power for the instrumentation in 
the satellite has been provided by 
covering one side of the satellite 
with solar cells which would derive 
energy directly from the sun. It 
would, therefore, be necessary to 
keep one side of it always facing 
the sun, or as nearly so as possible. 

(Fig- 1) 

The sequence of events necessary 
to put the satellite in its orbit, as- 
suming that it will be the “ideal” 
orbit described above, is as follows : 

The three stage assembly would 
be launched vertically from the 
government’s launching facilities 



in Cocoa, Florida. As soon as it has 
passed through the densest portion 
of the atmosphere, (about 20 miles 
altitude), its flight would be in- 
clined, by the flight programmer, 
8 degrees toward the west. This is 
to start neutralization of the Earth’s 
surface rotational velocity. At the 
same time, the programmer would 
command controls to incline the 
Satellite along a slowly curving 
path toward the north. If the 
launching is made in the summer- 
time, the end of this curving path 
must be calculated to place the 
satellite over an area 23 degrees in-

dined from the North Pole in the 
direction away from the sun. Its 
heading must be such that, as it 
continues its flight, it will pass over 
an area 23 degrees inclined from 
the South Pole in the direction 
toward the sun. (Fig. 1) 

At an altitude of just above 20 
miles, the integrating accelerometer 
located in the third stage would 
terminate the firing of Stage I and 
start the firing of the motor in 

THE SATELLITE VEHICLE 



Stage II. Separation would occur 
and stages II and III would leave 
Stage I behind. Stage I would coast 
along to an altitude of perhaps 60- 
70 miles and then fall back to 
earth, either to crash or to be re- 
covered, depending upon whether 
or not a recovery system has been 
provided. Stage I would have an 
initial weight of about 100 tons, 
including fuel, and would take off 
with stages II and III as payload, 

9 



with an initial acceleration of .3 
gravities net. It would have a burn- 
ing time of about 70 seconds and 
would reach a velocity of about 
2900 miles per hour. 

Seventy-five seconds after Stage 
II starts firing, the integrating ac- 
celerometer will signal the flight 
programmer to terminate the firing 
of Stage II and start the firing of 
Stage III. At this point Stage II 
will have reached an altitude of 
190 miles and a velocity of approx- 
imately 15,000 miles per hour. 
Since the Satellite will still have 
about 110 miles of altitude to gain, 
its position along the flight curve 
has not yet placed it in a horizontal 
position, but is at approximately a 
45 degree altitude angle to the 
horizontal. At this time, separation 
occurs between stages II and III, 
leaving Stage II behind. Stage III, 
continues accelerating along to the 
final flight curve attitude. 

Stage II would have a weight of 
about 15 tons, including fuel, and 
would weigh approximately 5 tons 
empty. It would develop a thrust 
of 120,000 pounds for about 75 
seconds and have an initial accele- 
ration of 3.75 times the Earth’s 
gravitational attraction. Due to the 
fact that during part of the flight 
Stage II was inclined at an angle 
toward the horizontal, gravity 



would not exert the normal drag. 
Therefore, the acceleration would 
increase more rapidly than if it 
were climbing vertically. 

After 37 seconds of bumng, the 
integrating accelerometer in Stage 
III, would have experienced the re- 
quired acceleration to achieve a 
velocity close to 18,000 miles per 
hour. At this time the acceler- 
ometer terminates the firing of 
Stage Ill’s motor. 

During the 37 seconds of burn- 
ing, the flight programmer would 
have held the rocket to the prede- 
termined curve which, at burnout, 
places the rocket in a horizontal 
attitude and in the “ideal” orbital 
path. 

Stage Ill’s motor is designed to 
develop a thrust of 4000 pounds, 
with a potential burning time of 60 
seconds. The rocket would have a 
total weight load of 2000 pounds. 
The fuel would be red fuming 
nitric acid as oxidant and hydrazine 
as reductant. It is planned that 
nearly 50% of the fuel would re- 
main in the tanks after the Satel- 
lite has reached its orbit, to be used 
later for the correction of the orbit 
after the residual atmosphere has 
begun to slow the Satellite down. 
This would greatly prolong the 
Satellite’s stay in its orbit.

miniaturization and sub-miniaturi- 
zation of all components. Wherever 
possible, transistors would be used 
instead of vacuum tubes, not only 
because of their small size, but also 
because of their low electrical 
power drain. 

The radio transmitter, which 
would be used for telemetry, would 
have a total power input of 20 watts 
with an output of approximately 
10 watts. It would be pulse modu- 
lated by an encoding device which 
receives information from the vari- 
ous sensing instruments. The en- 
coder converts the information into 
a data transmission code, which is 
transmitted back to Earth and re- 
corded for study at a later date. 

The Satellite would contain a 
small electric motor, and mounted 
on its shaft a little coil which rotates 
outside the skin of the Satellite. If 
the Satellite’s orbit should pass 
through a region of large electric 

THE SATELLITE VEHICLE 



currents (as recently predicted and 
detected in the ionosphere), the 
magnetic field produced by these 
currents would induce a current in 
the rotating coil. This would ap- 
pear as an A.G. signal, the ampli- 
tude of which would depend upon 
the magnitude of the current flow- 
ing in the ionosphere. This A.G. 
signal would be amplified and fed 
into the encoder. 

It is well to mention that in our 
design all signals from the sensing 
instruments are sampled one at a 
time, in rotation, by an electronic 
commutating device. This prevents 
the encoder from receiving infor- 
mation from two or more sources 
simultaneously. Also provided is a 
radio command receiver, consist- 
ing of a detector and control ampli- 
fier, to receive coded orbital cor- 
rection signals from transmitters at 
the monitor stations. The output 
of the receiver would be fed into 



13 





a decoder which converts the sig- 
nals into command impulses for the 
opening and closing of the fuel 
valves furnishing impulse power to 
the steering jets and main propul- 
sion motor. The power demand of 
the command receiver would be 
about 4 watts. 

The “B plus” supply for the 
transmitter and receiver would be a 
relaxation oscillator transformer 
supply, similar to that used in many 
brands of Geiger counters. This 
produces high voltage D.G. without 
using high voltage batteries. 

There would be a bank of photo 
cells looking through openings in 
the skin on the side of the Satellite 
facing the sun. These would have 
filters of graduated density in front 
of them to screen out all the visible 
rays and allow each photo cell to 
respond only to a narrow band of 
frequencies in the ultra-violet. The 
output of these cells would be am- 
plified and fed into the encoder. 

A similar bank of photo cells 
would be located on the dark side 
of the Satellite, focused in a hori- 
zontal direction parallel to the 
Earth’s surface. Some of these 
cells would have ultra-violet filters. 
Some would be sensitive to visible 
light of all frequencies, while others 
would respond only to certain 
selected colors. This bank of cells 
is to collect information on spec- 
trum and intensity of the “Auroral 
Lights” (or Northern Lights) from 
the very region in which they orig- 
inate. The signals from the photo 
cell banks are amplified by one 
stage of D.G. amplification, provid- 
ing cell isolation and building the 
signal to usable proportions. A mul- 

14 



tivibrator circuit is actuated by this 
amplified signal and the “flip-flop” 
frequency is then a function of the 
incident light intensity. The re- 
sultant A.C. signal is then fed into 
the encoder. 

Located near the front end of 
the Satellite, on the side facing the 
Earth, is a socket containing a 
hinged arm. Mounted on the free 
end of this arm is the sensing ele- 
ment of a magnetometer. When 
the Satellite’s propulsion motor 
ceases firing, an electronically oper- 
ated catch releases the arm and a 
spring swings it out and away from 
the body. The magnetometer can 
be one of several types, the most 
sensitive of which is made in 
Germany. It operates on the prin- 
ciple that a change in the magnetic 
field of the Earth, as seen by the 
sensing coil, produces a harmonic 
in the frequency of an oscillator. 
The size of the harmonic is a func- 
tion of the change in the magnetic 
field. This instrument is not only in- 
credibly sensitive, but it will not be 
influenced by any magnetic fields 
arising from the Satellite itself. The 
output of the magnetometer would 
be amplified and fed into the en- 
coder. 

The density of the residual at- 
mosphere in the region of the Satel- 
lite’s orbit may be measured by an 
instrument called an Alphatron. 
This device contains a small cap- 
sule of radium which emits alpha 
rays. The atmosphere enters into 
the space surrounding the radium 
capsule and is ionized by the alpha 
rays. The ions are attracted to an 
electrically charged plate, where 
they cause a current to flow in the 

JAMES M. NUDING 




circuit which is connected to the 
plate. The number of ions pro- 
duced is determined by the number 
of air molecules present, thus the 
current flowing in the circuit is a 
function of the air density. 

An electroscope is mounted be- 
neath a suitable screen which is 
opaque to all light radiations but is 
transparent to soft X-rays. This in- 
strument will be on the side facing 
the sun. This device is nothing 
more than a small, very high qual- 
ity capacitor, capable of holding a 
charge for a very long time. When 
X-rays fall on such a capacitor, 
they cause the charge to leak oft*, 
slowly or quickly, depending upon 
the intensity of the X-rays. By 
calibrating this electroscope with 
X-ray sources of known intensity, 
one can measure by comparison 
X-ray sources of unknown intensi- 
ty. An electronic circuit places a 
charge on the electroscope which 
immediately begins to leak off when 
exposed to the soft X-rays coming 
from the sun. As soon as the 
charge has decreased to a certain 
predetermined amount, the charge 
is replaced. The frequency of these 
recharging cycles, then, may be 
used as a measure of the X-ray in- 
tensity. This signal can be fed 
directly into the encoder. 

Another bit of information on 
the upper atmosphere which is of 
interest to the scientists of the 
I.G.Y. concerns the degree and 
type of ionization of the upper air. 
A possible instrument which could 
be installed in the Satellite and 
would give information about these 
phenomena would consist of a 
metal plate which would be open 

THE SATELLITE VEHICLE 



to the outside but shielded from all 
light. This plate would be elec- 
trically insulated and connected to 
an electronic circuit which would 
alternately place a positive and 
negative bias on it. While the plate 
was positive it would attract nega- 
tive ions; while negative it would 
attract positive ions. If there were 
positive ions present in the air, 
they would cause a current to flow 
in the circuit in one direction; if 
negative ions were present, the cur- 
rent would be in the opposite direc- 
tion. The size of the cunent would 
indicate the ion density. 



T he ground monitoring 
stations for the proposed satel- 
lite should be located geographi- 
cally, so that it can be under 
observation as continuously as pos- 
sible, especially when it is travers- 
ing regions of particular interest to 
the scientists. Obviously the areas 
of sky above the poles would be the 
most fruitful, informationwise, so 
that it is essential that there be 
several polar monitor stations. , 
At the equator, the area or strip 
of Earth, viewed by the Satellite 
as it makes its pole to pole circuits, 
is wide enough to give an overlap 
between strips. Due to the con- 
vergence of the lines of equal 
longitude, there would be a greater 
and greater overlap as the Satellite 
approaches the pole. Thus fewer 
monitor stations would be needed, 
until at the pole itself one station 
could observe every revolution. The 
number of stations located on other 
parts of the Earth depends upon

Project Hi-Psi 



BY FRANK RILEY 



The aliens were conducting an experiment un- 
der laboratory conditions. So, how could they 
guess that their guinea pigs held the ultimate 
weapon?

D r. LUCIFER BRILL stepped briskly down the cor- 
ridor of the Federal Building. The taps on his 
leather heels clicked a precise rhythm on the marble 
floor. 

He ignored the door that offered “Information”, 
passed up office after office until he came to the glass 
paneled door which informed him that behind it func- 
tioned the Director of FBI operations in the Los Angeles 
area. 

The door was locked. 

Lucifer Brill rubbed the knuckles of his left hand over 
the bristles of his sand-colored, neatly trimmed bit of 
mustache. It was a gesture known to all graduate stu- 
dents, Department of Parapsychology, Western Univer- 
sity, as an indication of annoyance. 

The possibility of this office being closed had definite- 
ly not been part of Lucifer Brill’s prospectus. 

A movement behind the opaque glass panel caught his 
attention. He rattled the knob. When this produced no 
results, he tapped with his immaculate fingernails on 
the glass.

A shadow moved inside the of- 
fice. The lock clicked. The door 
opened. 

An overweight young woman, 
obviously interrupted in the act of 
painting a lush mouth over thin 
lips, glared at him through a veneer 
of politeness. 

“Yes?” 

‘T have an appointment with the 
Director.” Lucifer Brill’s voice still 
carried the twang of boyhood in 
Chelmsford, Mass. 

The young woman’s plucked 
eyebrows arched. 

“This office is closed. If there is 
an emergency, you may . .” 
Lucifer handed her his card. 
The eyebrows arched still higher. 

“Dr. Brill! Your appointment 
was for 3:45!” 

“I am aware of that,” he told 
her, severely, “but the other driv- 
ers were not, and there were an in- 
credible number of them on the 
road. Now, if you please . .” 
“Would you care to make an- 
other appointment for tomorrow?” 
“I would not. You may inform 
the Director that I have arrived, 
that I regret my tardiness and that 
the purpose of my visit involves a 
matter of extreme urgency.” 

Lucifer hadn’t raised the level of 
his voice, but behind the rimless 
spectacles, his mild blue eyes be- 
came very cold and direct. The sec- 
retary unpursed her lips and 
flounced toward the inner office. 

She was back in a moment, and 
said with disapproval, 

“This way, please — Sir.” 

The Director greeted Lucifer 
Brill with a courtesy that was some- 
what strained. His briefcase was on 

18 



his desk. So was his hat. 

Lucifer went peremptorily to the 
point. 

“I must report a most serious 
case.” 

From long training, the Direc- 
tor ignored the tone and inquired 
with careful politeness. 

“What sort of a case. Dr. Brill?” 
“I believe you would call it a 
case of kidnapping — multiple kid- 
napping.” 

“Kid — kidnapping ! ’ ’ 

The Director’s large hands hit 
the desk top with a cracking sound. 
His knee touched a button to flip 
on the tape recorder. 

“When?— Where?— Who ” 
Lucifer considered the questions, 
methodically organized his answers. 

“As to when, I would say over 
the last eight years.” 

“What?” 

“As to where, I would say all 
over the United States.” 

“Now, one moment . please!” 
“As to who . Well, that would 
require a rather lengthy answer.” 
The Director’s voice shook with 
an effort to keep calm. 

“Dr. Brill, I would appreciate an 
answer to my question.” 

“Very well.” 

Lucifer took a small, brown 
leather notebook from the inside 
pocket of his beautifully pressed 
gabardine. 

“It will take a little time. You 
see, I believe that over 3,000 per- 
sons have been kidnapped.” 

The Director’s thick neck turned 
prime-rib red, and swelled over the 
collar of his shirt. Lucifer began to 
read: 

“Anthell, Ruth . Atwater, 
FRANK RILEY 




Horace . Borsook, George . 
‘That’s enough, Dr. Brill!” 
“Thank you. Time really is of 
the essence, you know. I learned 
this morning that two of the miss- 
ing persons disappeared as recently 
as four days ago.” 

The Director breathed heavily. 
“Just who are these people, Dr. 
Brill?” 

“They are all positives. Some of 
them are positive positives.” 

The Director made a small, 
strangling sound. 

“If you don’t mind. Dr. Brill — 
just what in the hell are positive 
positives?” 

“Oh, I’m sorry. I had presumed 
you were familiar with my work.” 
“Fm a little vague about it.” 

“I see.” Lucifer’s expression 
showed intolerance for this cultural 
lag, but he condescended to ex- 
plain. “For several years I have 
been re-evaluating psi card tests at 
Western University, with the proj- 
ect goal of answering criticism that 
Rhine and other researchers ended 
scoring runs at so-called convenient 
points. While one cannot approach 
the statistical ideal of infinity in 
any series, it is nevertheless mathe- 
matically possible, through multi- 
tudinous repetitions . .” 

There was an expression on the 
Director’s face of a man trying to 
plod doggedly against a strong gale. 

“Positives . .” he reminded, a 
little desperately. 

“. to amass statistics that are 
conclusively beyond the bounds of 
chance. In this rechecking, I have 
received excellent cooperation from 
researchers at other universities, 
and consequently have compiled 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



what may well be the largest list of 
psi cases on record, whereby . .” 

“Positives,” grated the Director. 
“Kidnapping . remember. Dr. 
Brill . ?” 

“. I have been able to estab- 
lish categories — in my own termi- 
nology — of non-positives, positives 
and positive-positives. Do you fol- 
low me. Sir?” 

“Absolutely.” The FBI Director 
removed sweat from his forehead 
with the back of his hand. “Now, 
shall we get on with this kidnap- 
ping ...” 

“I am convinced that my posi- 
tives and positive positives are 
either being kidnapped, or other- 
wise caused to disappear involun- 
tarily.” 

“3,000 of them?” 

“3,116.” 

The Director, in this crisis, took 
refuge in routine. He picked up 
Lucifer’s card. 

“Do you have any other identi- 
fication with you. Dr. Brill.” 

The routine was a mistake. Luci- 
fer produced an expired driver’s 
license, an unpaid gas bill, a mem- 
bership card in the American So- 
ciety for Psychic Research, a faculty 
football ticket, a credit slip from 
the May Company, six traffic cita- 
tions . 

The Director held up his hand 
in weary surrender. 

“O.K.,” he said. “Tell me all 
about it.” 

Lucifer told his story with an ad- 
mirable lack of detail, and a cer- 
tain intensity that compelled atten- 
tion. 

At a certain phase of his project, 
it was necessary to start re-evalu- 



19 




ating cases he had previously re- 
evaluated. That phase had been 
reached two months ago. He had 
selected five hundred names from 
his card file, and had sent them 
form letters preparatory to arrang- 
ing for tests. 

When 480 came back marked 
“Address Unknown”, or “No For- 
warding Address”, he was dis- 
turbed, but not unduly so. In an 
era of great population shifts, peo- 
ple could be lost and forgotten. 

He mailed out another 500 
forms. Four hundred and sixty- 
three came back unopened. 

A third mailing brought similar 
results. Subsequent mailings added 
up to the startling statistic that 
some 3,000 people apparently had 
vanished. 

Lucifer personally checked a 
score of names in the greater Los 
Angeles area. Five could not be lo- 
cated ; seven seemed to have moved 
without leaving a forwarding ad- 
dress; one was reported drowned in 
the surf off Point Fermin; six were 
listed with the Missing Persons Bu- 
reau. Of the latter, two had briefly 
made headlines. They had kissed 
their wives goodby, driven off to 
work and had never been seen 
again. 

Against his will, the FBI Director 
was impressed by Lucifer Brill’s 
calm recital of these facts. 

“But 3,000 people,” he de- 
murred. “Isn’t it simply incredible 
that 3,000 people could disappear 
without causing a commotion?” 

“Do you know the number of 
missing persons listed annually by 
the Los Angeles Police Depart- 
ment?” 

20 



The Director admitted he did 
not. 

“Nearly 4,000 juveniles and 
adults. The number in other cities 
is roughly proportionate to the pop- 
ulation . New York, for exam- 
ple, had about eight . .” 

The FBI Director made his de- 
cision. 

“Dr. Brill,” he said, “Give me 
that list of names and addresses.” 



W ITHIN twenty-four hours, 
teletypes began pouring in 
from the District Offices of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Individually, the reports meant 
nothing. Obscure people who sim- 
ply were missing. Many of them 
were not even missed enough to be 
listed as missing persons. 

The final tabulation showed that 
3,223 men and women were miss- 
ing out of 4,775 people who had 
registered significantly above- 
chance in the psi re-evaluation 

tests conducted by Western Uni- 

versity. 

Lucifer Brill pointed out some- 
thing else. 

“The missing positives were my 
stronger positives. Most of those 
who have not disappeared were 

closer to borderline cases.” 

At this point, to the infinite re- 
lief of the Los Angeles office, prime 
responsibility for the case shifted to 
Washington, D.C. 

A tight lid of security was 

clamped over the whole affair. 
FBI analysts went to work on the 
facts and figures. Mathematically, 
they proved that the percentage of 
missing psi test cases was fantas- 

FRANK RILEY 




tically above the probability of co- 
incidence. 

One by one, the people had 
dropped from sight, lost in the 
swirling undercurrents of a vast, 
shifting population. A school 
teacher in Little Rock, a side-show 
freak in Chattanooga, a TV sales- 
man in Milwaukee, an artist in 
Philadelphia — all had disappeared, 
obscurely but definitely. 

And the disappearances were 
continuing. 

Only two days before an inquir- 
ing FBI agent called on a pharma- 
cist in Dubuque, the man had 
closed up the drugstore, started 
for home and had never been seen 
again. He was listed as an amnesia 
victim at the local police depart- 
ment. In his psi test, four years ear- 
lier, he had consistently averaged 
seventeen out of twenty-five calls. 
Remorselessly, the accrual of new 
facts added to the Bureau’s bewil- 
derment. 

One of the FBI statisticians 
pointed out that almost an identi- 
cal number of men and women 
were missing: 1,596 men; 1,627 
women. 

Another perceptive young re- 
searcher ran cards on the missing 
positives through an IBM machine, 
and came up with this statistic: 
The women were between the ages 
of 17 and 35; the men between 19 
and 45. Eighty percent of both 
sexes were in their late twenties. 

When all possible data had been 
assembled, the FBI gingerly sub- 
mitted its report to a super-secret 
meeting of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 

The reaction was not flattering. 
PROJECT HI-PSI 



Navy’s slightly profane com- 
ment was that someone in the Bu- 
reau had flipped his wig. 

Army looked disgusted. 

State Department was pained. 

White House was silent. 

The Chairman smiled, and 
waited for someone else to laugh. 

No one laughed. 

Red-faced but unyielding, FBI 
insisted that its report merited seri- 
ous consideration. 

“We’ve kept this thing quiet,” 
FBI said, “but you know what the 
reporters could do with it.” 

State looked less pained. Even 
Army and Navy gave reluctant at- 
tention. White House asked tenta- 
tively, 

“What about the Russian angle? 
If even a fraction of this nonsense 
we hear about psi is true, these peo- 
ple might serve an espionage pur- 
pose. Gould Soviet agents have 
smuggled them out of the coun- 
try?” 

“A few, maybe,” admitted FBI. 
“But not 3,223. Not by any known 
method of transportation.” 

“Any subversives among them?” 
asked Army. 

“One hard-shelled Commie, a 
few fuzzy-minded joiners . about 
par for the course.” 

“Then why in the hell is this im- 
portant, anyway?” demanded 
Navy. 

A large hassle ensued, but all 
eventually agreed that if more than 
3,000 people actually had been 
caused to vanish, it was at least po- 
tentially a cause for security con- 
cern. Army pointed out: 

“Next time, they might not waste 
the effort on these crackpots. They 



21 




might bag some important people.” 

White House asked : 

“What are we going to do about 
it?” 

There was an outburst of silence. 

Finally, State spoke up: 

“By all means, keep the matter 
quiet. It could be deucedly embar- 
rassing.” 

But something, of course, had to 
be done. 

And while something was being 
debated, at top level, in top secrecy, 
in eyes-only, Q-clearance sanctums, 
Lucifer Brill took matters into his 
own hands. 

He felt a compelling personal 
responsibility to the missing peo- 
ple, Their names had been com- 
piled together in his files; he had 
made no effort to protect the lists. 
Anyone who wanted to make the 
attempt could have found a way 
to copy the cards. 

Lucifer also felt a sense of re- 
sponsibility to science. And by sci- 
ence, he meant his o'vn branch of 
parapsychology. All other science 
eicisted for him in a vague limbo 
into which no serious psychologi- 
cal student would venture. “Nuts 
and bolts,” was the way Lucifer 
customarily dismissed the shadow- 
world of science outside his own 
laboratory. 

But what use was it to go on 
confirming and re-confirming the 
existence of positives and positive 
positives if they just up and disap- 
peared? 

The answer was discouraging. 

So Lucifer Brill took stock of 
himself. 

He was forty-four years old. He 
had no dependents, and was de- 

22 



pendent on no one. Except for 
chronic nearsightedness, and hay 
fever in the months of July and 
August, he was sound of limb and 
body. 

Lucifer withdrew from the bank 
the balance of his inheritance and 
life savings. He placed the money 
in a trust fund to be given to West- 
ern University for continuance of 
psi research, five years after his 
death or disappearance. He drew 
up a holographic will bequeathing 
and bequesting his library and pa- 
pers to the University. He prepared 
a sealed envelope containing three 
hundred dollars in cash and in- 
structions for the care of his two 
parrots for the balance of their nat- 
ural lives. 

And then Lucifer Brill released 
to the profession the news that 
after testing thousands of people 
for the psi talent, he had finely 
tested himself — and had scored an 
average of 19 out of 25 in 4,000 
PT tests, all conducted under 
strict laboratory conditions. 

Parapsychological circles reacted 
with an affectionate blend of awe 
and amusement. Fellow professors 
wrote him congratulatory notes, 
some with postscripts that jibed at 
him goodnaturedly. The editors of 
two psychic journals called to ask 
for articles. One Eastern university 
wanted to test him for PC and PK, 
but Lucifer stalled for time, waiting 
for something or someone to cause 
him to vanish from the face of the 
earth. 

On the evening of August 23, 
about eight-thirty, there was a 
knock on the screen door of his 
bachelor apartment. Lucifer called, 

FRANK RILEY 




“Come in, please,” but he contin- 
ued to work at a statistical tabula- 
tion. 

The door opened; footsteps ap- 
proached his desk. 

“Sit down,” said Lucifer. He had 
been expecting a summer school 
graduate student to come by for a 
book. ‘T’ll be through with this 
column in just a moment.” 

“There is no hurry. Dr. Brill.” 
The voice was strange. It had al- 
most a metallic ring. 

Lucifer’s fingers turned white 
where they gripped the pencil. But 
he carefully totalled up the column 
and rechecked the answer, ferreting 
out an error in the addition of 29 
plus 8. 

Only then did he swivel around 
to face the tall, thin, dark-faced 
stranger. Lucifer said quietly, 
“Good evening. I am sorry to 
have kept you waiting.” 

The stranger nodded, and took a 
small blue phial from his pocket. 
Long, lean-muscled fingers 
squeezed the phial. 

Lucifer’s apartment faded gently 
away in the sweet, cloying odor of 
hyacinth. 

W HEN LUCIFER Brill opened 
his eyes, his face was half 
buried in a white pillow. A damp 
breeze blew across the back of his 
neck. The breeze was heavy with 
tropical odors. Yet there was some- 
thing curious about them. Lucifer 
sniffed, and sniffed again. He dis- 
covered that his hay fever wasn’t 
bothering him. 

Through one probing eye, Luci- 
fer could see his glasses on a night- 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



stand. Beyond them was a window 
down which drops of rain were be- 
ginning to streak. 

Memories of the blue phial and 
the strange visitor flooded back. 
His right arm was numb, but he 
decided he had been sleeping on it. 
He experimented with his toes and 
legs. 

They moved. 

His right knee bumped against 
an object on the other side of the 
bed. The object felt alien to any- 
thing in Lucifer Brill’s previous ex- 
perience. He pushed firmly with 
his knee, and felt something that 
was both firm and soft, yielding 
and unyielding, warm and slightly 
cold. 

There was a sleepy murmur of 
protest, and the alien object moved 
away. 

Lucifer Brill obeyed habit. He 
reached for his glasses. Then he 
raised himself on his tingling right 
elbow and peered cautiously to- 
ward the other side of the bed. 

By many standards, Lucifer 
could have been adjudged a brave 
man. But what he saw had a curi- 
ously frightening effect on him. 

He saw the back of a woman’s 
head, and a tangle of dark hair, a 
bare, sun-brown arm, a bare shoul- 
der. 

Lucifer took off his glasses, 
breathed upon them, polished them 
thoughtfully on a corner of the 
sheet, and looked again. 

The apparition was still there. 
Only now the head was turned. 
The eyes that were watching him 
were wide and startled. The lips 
moved in sort of a gasping sound. 
They framed the words: 



23 




“Get out of my bed!” 

In spite of a certain paralysis, 
Lucifer bridled at the words. He 
was a rational man, and believed 
that words should originate in a 
context of rationality. 

“I can assure you,” he stated, 
“that I am not voluntarily in your 
bed, and that I have no intention 
of remaining here.” 

There was another gasping 
sound. The eyes widened still more. 
The lips exclaimed. “Dr. Brill! Dr. 
Lucifer Brill!” 

Lucifer made a sound that was 
as close to a gurgle as he had come 
since infancy. 

When he had collated his emo- 
tions, he asked in his customary 
tone, 

“Have we met?” 

The lips smiled wryly. 

“It looks that way.” 

“Ah ... Yes, of course. But, I 
mean . under social or profes- 
sional circumstances?” 

“You’re the odd little man who 
gave me those card tests in San 
Diego last winter.” 

Lucifer Brill digested this infor- 
mation in dignified silence. He con- 
sidered the woman gravely, then 
took the white sheet and covered 
her up to her chin. 

She gasped again. 

“There are certain proprieties,” 
he reminded her severely. 

He considered her again, trying 
to place her face and its personality 
among the thousands of people he 
had psi-tested. It was what he 
would term a Type III face, al- 
though he had never been able to 
establish any defineable connection 
between bone structure and psi 

24 



positive characteristics. This was a 
strong face on the pillow beside 
him. Strong and at the same time 
possessed of certain female quali- 
ties, principally in the fullness of 
the rather large lips and in the 
throat lines. The cheek bones were 
fairly high. The skin texture in- 
dicated a chronological age of 
about thirty. 

Having thus appraised and cata- 
logued the woman, Lucifer asked, 
“May I have the privilege of mak- 
ing your acquaintance?” 

“Wh . what?” 

“Your name,” he said impatient- 
ly. “Do you mind telling me your 
name?” 

“Nina . Nina Poteil. They call 
me Nina . professionally.” 

“Professionally . Lucifer 
rolled the word on his tongue as 
though he relished its flavor. “May 
I inquire as to the nature of your 
profession?” 

“You don’t remember? Oh, well, 
I guess you’d call me a psycholo- 
gist.” 

“A psychologist!” Lucifer’s eyes 
glowed with relief and approval. 
If he had to awake to find himself 
in these distressing circumstances, 
it was good to know that he was 
with a confrere. 

“Really!” he said. “I had no 
idea! It astonishes me that I do not 
remember you. What is your spe- 
cialization?” 

“I’m called an entertainment 
psychologist.” 

“How extraordinary! Where do 
you practice?” 

“At the Blue Grotto on Fifth 
Street. I’m billed for character 
readings. Cards are my medium, 

FRANK RILEY 




but I don’t need them, of course.” 

“Oh.” 

Lucifer adjusted his glasses. He 
said, “Now, if you will kindly face 
toward the opposite wall, I will get 
out of this bed. 

As Lucifer climbed out of bed, 
he was painfully conscious of a 
short kimono that scarcely reached 
to his white, bony knees. Panic- 
stricken, he looked around for 
something else to wear, and found 
some neatly folded garments on a 
chair behind his side of the bed. 
With a shock, he realized this was 
exactly the way he had always left 
his own clothes overnight. 

Only these were not his own 
clothes. They appeared to be made 
of a light, semi-transparent plastic 
material. There was a pair of trou- 
sers that fit rather like jodhpurs, a 
loose, practical tunic, and boots of 
the same thin material. When he 
had dressed, he still felt like a man 
in a goldfish bowl. 

Looking out the window, he saw 
that they were near the center of a 
very large compound, comprising 
hundreds of small dwellings, all 
constructed of a slate-like grey 
metal. Each dwelling was sur- 
rounded with a neat area of what 
appeared at first glance to be a 
lawn. On closer observation, it was 
a lush, mossy growth, deep green 
in color. At one end of the com- 
pound was a much larger building, 
sprawling into many wings and 
substructures. Behind it rose a 
tremendous, yet somehow slender 
and graceful, silhouette of a shin- 
ing projectile, aimed toward the 
clouds. Around the compound, at 
intervals of about two hundred 



yards, were tall guard towers. The 
compound itself seemed to be lo- 
cated in a vast, towering forest that 
rolled away in all directions until 
it disappeared in the low-hanging 
mists. Through a break in the 
clouds, Lucifer saw a giant, orange 
wheel, many times the size of the 
sun he had known all his life. 

“Amazing,” Lucifer murmured. 

Averting his eyes from the bed, 
he walked across the room and 
opened a door. It led to a large, 
bright room, artificially lighted 
from a source he could not deter- 
mine. At the far end of the room 
were a door and glass casement 
windows that opened on a small, 
mossy clearing. The forest curved 
in behind the clearing, and walled 
it off. In the room itself, a large 
screen occupied most of one wall. 
The furniture was extremely func- 
tional. Everything, even the cush- 
ions on a low couch, appeared to 
be made of a tinted metal. But 
when Lucifer touched one of the 
cushions, it yielded resiliently. 

“Amazing,” he repeated. 

In his astonishment, Lucifer for- 
got himself and looked toward the 
bed. 

“Miss Poteil, have you any idea 
where we are?” 

“I woke up after you did,” she 
reminded him. 

“I see.” He regarded her sternly. 
“What is your last recollection 
prior to awakening?” 

“I don’t know . Yes, I do!” 
She sat up, then sank back and cov- 
ered herself again as he glared dis- 
approval. “I was in the Blue Grotto 
—It was getting late, and I had 
just left my card — like I always do 



PROJECT HI-PSI 



25 




— at a table where two men were 
drinking. One of them said, ‘Sure, 
we want a reading.’ Then I sat 
down, and that’s all I remember.” 

“All?” he insisted, as if question- 
ing a reluctant student. 

“There was kind of a strange 
odor . .” 

“I know.” 

“You do!” She bolted upright, 
forgetting the sheet. She looked ac- 
cusingly at him. 

“Naturally, I recall the same 
odor. How else do you suppose I 
happened to wake up in this bed?” 

“I wondered.” 

Lucifer turned back to the win- 
dow in time to see two men, in the 
same plastic tunic and leggings he 
was wearing, approaching the front 
of their bungalow. 

“We have visitors,” he said. 
“Perhaps we shall also have some 
answers. While I greet them, I sug- 
gest that you make an effort to ac- 
quire some kind of apparel.” 



O NE OF THE visitors was a 
gaunt, heavy-boned man, ex- 
ceedingly tall. Lucifer guessed his 
height at close to seven feet. The 
bone structure of his face was harsh 
and massive. His head was shaved; 
the flesh deeply bronzed. The sec- 
ond visitor was nearly as tall, but 
he was older, and his shoulders 
sagged. Bronze skin hung loosely 
over the bones of his face. 

After a cautious glance over his 
shoulder indicated that Nina had 
stepped into the semi-transparent 
leggings and tunic that appeared to 
be standard garb, Lucifer opened 
the door and faced the men coming 

26 



up the path. 

The younger of the two nodded. 

“Good morning. Dr. Brill.” 

His voice had the same metallic 
timbre that Lucifer had first heard 
from the tall visitor in his own 
study. 

The older man stepped close to 
Lucifer and gazed intently into his 
eyes. 

“He has emerged,” he said. 

“Good. In that case, we must in- 
troduce ourselves all over again.” 
The large man bowed slightly, then 
drew himself stiffly erect. “Dr. Brill, 
in your language, my name would 
approximate the phonetic sounds: 
Huth Glaspac. You may call me 
Huth. I am the Administrative Di- 
rector of this project.” He indi- 
cated his older companion. “This 
is our medical director. For sim- 
plicity, you may call him Dr. 
Thame.” 

Lucifer studied them gravely. 

“Come in. Gentlemen,” he said. 

Awkwardly, he went through the 
motions of introducing them to 
Nina. Dr. Thame examined Nina’s 
eyes, and nodded. 

“Our laboratory calculations 
were correct,” he pronounced in a 
brittle voice that reflected satisfac- 
tion. To Nina and Lucifer he ex- 
plained. “Due to the differing 
metabolisms of your bodies, it re- 
quired a rather delicate calculation 
to bring you both out of the drug 
at the same time. It was estimated 
to occur about four cintros . 
that is, hours . ago, during your 
sleep . .” 

“Gentlemen,” Lucifer inter- 
rupted impatiently, “do you mind 
telling us where we are and what

this is all about?” 

Huth’s massive bronze features 
lightened with the shadow of a 
smile, 

“It is doubtful that the answer to 
either question will be helpful at 
this time. However, in response to 
the first, may I inquire: Have you 
studied astronomy?” 

Lucifer drew himself up with 
dignity, “I am a Parapsychologist.” 
Again there was the shadow of a 
smile on Huth’s bronze features. 

“The extreme specialization of 
your science will never cease to 
amaze me. At any rate, you are on 
the planet Melus, one of the outer 
planets of the star which your Earth 
astronomers call Capella, and 
which they place in the constella- 
tion of Auriga.” 

Lucifer blinked rapidly and 
rubbed the bristles of his mustache 
with more than ordinary vigor. 
Some of his colleagues at Western 
University had worked on rocket 
projects. He had always suspected 
they were fools; now he was sure 
of it. Why else would they be wast- 
ing their time with rockets, while 
another race was running around 
the universe, kidnapping positives? 

It was Nina who spoke up first, 
her dark, deep-set eyes burning 
with excitement. 

“Capella ... I know!” she ex- 
claimed. “Sometimes I work with 
the medium of astrology. It doesn’t 
mean anything, really, no more 
than the cards. I could do just as 
well without either. But the cus- 
tomers . Say, unless you’re not 
telling the truth, Mr. Huth, we’re 
quite a ways from San Diego!” 
“The distance is not important,” 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



said Huth. “Melus is now your 
home, and will be for the rest of 
your lives.” 

As the import of his words 
reached them, Lucifer blinked 
again. Nina sat down on the edge 
of the steel-grey couch. 

“For the rest of our lives,” she 
repeated wonderingly. “That’s a 
long time.” 

“It is to be hoped,” said Dr. 
Thame. 

Lucifer had to speak with more 
than usual severity in order to keep 
the tremor out of his voice. “I 
asked two questions,” he reminded 
Huth. 

Huth nodded. 

“Your second question will be 
answered during your orientation 
period,” 

“And how long does that last?” 

“It varies. For you, Dr. Brill, it 
could be much longer than for your 
wife.” 

“My — ” This time, Lucifer’s dry 
New England twang definitely 
broke. 

“Oh, yes. We learned that by 
observing the rituals of your culture 
we can minimize emotional trauma 
and thereby hasten orientation.” 
He turned to Nina. “I can assure 
you that the proper Earth rituals 
were performed in the prescribed 
manner. Since neither of you were 
married, we could dispense with 
the Earth divorce ritual and per- 
form only the marriage ritual. Does 
that ease your mind?” 

She stared at him without an- 
swering. 

Lucifer’s temper bristled. 

“I refuse to recognize such mock- 
ery. It is immoral, illegal and defi- 

27 




nitely unethical.” 

Huth dismissed the matter with 
a slight shake of his massive head, 
and proceeded to explain some of 
the objective facts of their situa- 
tion. 

During orientation period, they 
would be required to remain on 
their own premises, except for their 
educational sessions at Center. 
They would be taken to Center 
once or twice each day, depending 
on their progress. Food preparation 
was handled at the Project com- 
missary. Huth opened a small pan- 
try. Meals, cooked by molecular 
agitation in the commissary, would 
be delivered to the pantry via the 
commissary tubicular. He showed 
them how to turn on the visagraph 
screen. 

“This is used for communication, 
education and also entertainment. 
You will find it very pleasant to 
read micro-filmed books off the 
screen. We also have a rather com- 
plete repertory of Earth music. 
After orientation, you will be as- 
signed duties, and, of course, can 
become acquainted with fellow 
members of this project.” 

Dr. Thame added briefly that 
Melus had been chosen for the 
project because it was a hydrogen- 
oxygen planet similar to Earth, al- 
though almost uniformly tropical. 
The inner planets of the system 
were not inhabitable, since Capel- 
la, with three times the mass of Sol, 
produced one hundred times more 
heat. 

“You’ll discover that members of 
your Project have given this planet 
another name,” he concluded. “But 
don’t let it disturb you.” 

28 



Nina spoke up suddenly. 

“The name is — It’s Mendel’s 
Planet!” 

A muscle twitched in Huth’s 
bronze cheek. “How did you know 
that?” 

She shook her head. 

“I never know how. Things just 
come to me. Sometimes I say — said 
things to my customers at the Blue 
Grotto, and they would ask me the 
same thing. How do I know?” She 
shrugged her strong shoulders. 
“How does anyone know they know 
anything?” 

Huth and Dr. Thame exchanged 
quick glances. 

“Very interesting,” said Huth. 
He moved toward the door. “We 
will send for you in two hours for 
your basic family record test.” 

“Basic fam — .” Lucifer choked 
on the word. He asked bleakly. 
“What might that be?” 

“It will be elementary to you. 
Dr. Brill. Just a basic psi-card test. 
We have your record, of course, but 
for purposes of standardization, we 
always start a new family’s record 
in this manner. You undoubtedly 
will score rather close to your high 
test score on Earth.” 

Lucifer hoped his apprehension 
did not show. He had not expected 
having to meet this challenge so 
soon. 

Nina had been pursing her lips, 
frowning and thoughtful. Now she 
asked. 

“Mr. Huth, how long have we. 
Dr. Brill and I, been here on 
Melus?” 

A hint of humor flickered in 
Huth’s somber eyes. 

“Two Earth months.” 



FRANK RILEY 




F or several moments after 
their departure, Lucifer stalked 
silently around the room. Nina re- 
mained on the couch. Her eyes 
were closed; her hands folded on 
her legs. There was a click in the 
pantry. Nina got up and looked in- 
side. Breakfast had arrived. 

“We’d better eat something,” she 
told Lucifer. 

“I am not hungry. Miss Poteil.” 
She brought a plate, and stood 
resolutely before him. 

“This is going to be a hard day. 
You will need the food.” 

He tried to stare her down, but 
couldn’t. He accepted the plate, 
feeling like a chided school boy. 

Lucifer ate in silence, and when 
he had finished, he wandered out 
into the mossy patio behind the 
bungalow. There was a milky 
opaqueness, without obvious form 
or solidity, that walled the area off 
from the bungalow on either side. 
The rear of the patio, facing the 
forest, was clear, but when he 
walked too far in that direction, an 
invisible force shocked him warn- 
ingly, and he leaped back. 

The trees were incredibly high; 
their canopy of branches and leaves 
was tightly interwoven. The rain 
had stopped momentarily, but 
water dripped unceasingly from the 
canopy to the mat of leaves on the 
forest floor. Spidery root tendrils 
crawled upward to mesh with tree 
boles and hanging vines. There was 
a smell of eternal dampness. Some- 
where back in the shadows, an ani- 
mal cried out. It sounded like a 
woman in pain. 

Lucifer shivered. He wished for- 
lornly that he had left matters up 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



to the FBI and the Central Intelli- 
gence Agency. He reviewed his 
prospects, and did not find them 
good. In a narrow sense, he had 
succeeded. He had found his posi- 
tives and positive positives, but he 
did not yet know why they had been 
kidnapped. Nor was it likely that 
the knowledge would do him much 
good. He was on a strange planet, 
in the system of a distant star, ap- 
parently destined to spend the rest 
of his life with a woman who had 
been a nightclub fortune teller. 

As a doctor of parapsychology, 
Lucifer was appalled. As a con- 
firmed bachelor, he was horrified. 

But a more immediate problem 
clamored for consideration. What 
happened to non-positives on 
Melus? 

He would soon know. 

The two attendants who came to 
take them to Center were much 
younger than Huth. They carried 
themselves with military stiffness. 
Nina and Lucifer were led to what 
vaguely resembled a motorboat, 
covered with a transparent bubble. 
The conveyance hovered in the air, 
about two feet above a narrow 
pathway that was surfaced with a 
dark, burnished metal. Lucifer ac- 
cepted the vehicle without surprise. 
Physical scientists had always re- 
minded him of boys playing with 
erector sets, and their accomplish- 
ments bored him. 

Center was a series of low slate- 
metal buildings scattered over sev- 
eral acres. Some were inter-con- 
nected; some were separated by 
mossy areas. The outer walls were 
broken by tall casement windows 
that extended from just above the 

29 




ground to just below the eaves. 

As they circled among the build- 
ings, the casement windows began 
to swing shut. Lucifer thought at 
first that this had something to do 
with their coming, but then he saw 
the thunder clouds tumbling in 
over the forest roof and heard the 
approaching rain. 

The hot wind swept open a gate 
as they were rounding one of the 
opaquely enclosed areas. Lucifer 
caught a nerve-shocking glimpse of 
many grotesquely malformed crea- 
tures stumbling, sprawling and hop- 
ping into the building, under the 
supervision of several bronzed, 
statuesque attendants. One crea- 
ture, with a huge bulging head that 
flopped uncontrollably from shoul- 
der to shoulder, was bounding 
along on a single leg. Its twisted 
features were grimacing horribly. 

Lucifer did not raise his eyes to 
Nina’s face, but through the trans- 
parent sleeves of her tunic, he saw 
the muscles in her arms grow rigid. 

The conveyance stopped in front 
of the entrance to one of the larger 
buildings. An attendant met them 
as they stepped out of the vehicle. 
He led them down a long, glass- 
roofed corridor. The rain was now 
drumming dismally against the 
glass 

A blindfolded girl of about six 
passed them in the corridor. She 
stepped politely to one side, then 
continued surely and unconcerned- 
ly on her way. 

Huth received them in a large 
room equipped with two rows of 
facing desks. 

“As I told you,” he explained to 
Lucifer, “these tests will be very 

30 



elementary. Together with your 
Earth records, they will form part 
of your basic family file. And,” he 
added, harshness edging into his 
voice, “it will be wise for you to 
give us your complete cooperation.” 

One of the attendants led Nina 
to a seat in front of a desk. The 
other attendant beckoned to Lu- 
cifer. 

“If you please,” Lucifer said to 
Huth, “I would like to observe 
your technique. Being a profession- 
al man, you know . .” 

Huth assented. 

“May I compliment you on your 
attitude. Dr. Brill. Such an interest 
can shorten your period of orienta- 
tion, and it raises my already con- 
siderable expectations for you. But 
we do not pretend to any original- 
ity of technique.” 

After watching the attendant run 
through twenty-five cards with 
Nina, Lucifer was quite ready to 
agree with Huth. The technique 
was crude, far below minimal lab- 
oratory standards. 

Nina’s attention wandered about 
the room, but she called off the 
cards without hesitation. The at- 
tendant took her through three 
runs, checked his file record and 
stood up with a shrug. He said 
something to Huth in a language 
that blurred and rasped. 

“Dr. Brill,” said Huth, “will you 
oblige us now?” 

Lucifer stepped resolutely to the 
desk, but the palms of his hands 
were moist. Over the past two dec- 
ades he had taken many tests, 
enough to know that he could never 
score above chance save for an oc- 
casional run of coincidence. 



FRANK RILEY 




And this was not one of those 
runs. He saw it in the attendant’s 
manner before five cards had been 
turned. Desperately, he fumbled 
ahead, guessing blindly. 

At the end of the first run, the 
attendant spoke rapidly to Huth. 

Lucifer saw Nina watching him 
with surprise. 

“This technique is incredible!” 
he snapped at Huth. “With all the 
distractions in this room, not to 
mention the emotional stress of our 
situation, a true score would have 
to depend on chancel” 

“That is not necessarily so,” 
Huth answered calmly. “The 
stronger a psi sense may be, the 
more easily it is brought into use, 
regardless of external circum- 
stances. You Earth scientists go to 
incredible lengths to test under lab- 
oratory conditions an ability that 
does not belong in the laboratory.” 
“Ridiculous! Laboratory stand- 
ards were necessary to prove the 
existence of psi.” 

“Therefore, Earth scientists will 
go on proving it to each other for 
the next hundred years.” 

“What are you proving by this 
inferior duplication of our psi 
tests?” Lucifer challenged, hoping 
to divert attention from another 
disastrous run of the cards. 

“More than you suspect. Dr. 
Brill. For one thing, by checking 
this first test with your Earth rec- 
ord, and later with additional tests, 
we can obtain an indication of 
your response to orientation. This 
could be important to you, vitally 
important, I might add. Now, shall 
we proceed.” 

It was an order, not a question. 
PROJECT HI-PSI 



Lucifer saw Nina nod at him, 
and try to smile encouragingly. 
This fed his anger with the fuel of 
humiliation. 

The attendant took a new deck 
of cards, began to turn them. 

Brill felt his eyes drawn again to 
Nina. He called out his answer, un- 
thinkingly. “Circle . circle . 
star . rectangle . circle . .” 

When the run was completed, 
the attendant instantly started an- 
other. 

A third and a fourth run, then 
the attendant turned to Huth with 
a rapid burst of language. 

“Excellent,” said Huth. “Excel- 
lent, Dr. Brill. All you needed to do 
was relax! Excepting the first run, 
you averaged very close to your 
Earth score.” 

Since awakening that morning, 
Lucifer had found his professional 
equanimity tried sorely on several 
occasions. But never more so than 
at this moment. To have scored so 
significantly above chance on three 
consecutive card runs was a greater 
shock than awakening to find him- 
self with a strange wife on a strange 
planet. The law of probability was 
the unchallengeable bastion of his 
private world. 

He caught Nina’s glance again. 
Her dark eyes were watching him 
in a way he could not understand. 

Huth said, “This has been a most 
satisfactory prelude to orientation. 
We can proceed immediately.” He 
touched a button. In a moment. 
Dr. Thame entered. “You will go 
with Dr. Thame,” Huth told Nina. 
“Your husband will remain here.” 

Nina looked at Lucifer again, 
hesitated, then turned away with- 

31 




out comment and followed Dr. 
Thame out of the room. Huth led 
Lucifer into a smaller office. 

‘‘This procedure is somewhat un- 
usual/’ Huth commented. “Ordi- 
narily, new arrivals are assigned di- 
rectly to units of the Orientation 
Staff. But we have special hopes 
and plans for both of you. In par- 
ticular, Dr. Brill, you can be of 
great service to us.” 

It was difficult for Lucifer to be 
anything but forthright, but he 
tried. “Psi is my work,” he said. “I 
suppose it matters little enough 
where I work at it. But it would 
help to know the purpose of all 
this.” 

“Undoubtedly. But it will not be 
easy for you.” 

“I am not a child.” 

“No, but you are an Earth sci- 
entist.” 

Lucifer felt his anger rising 
again. 

“I’m afraid I don’t follow you.” 

“I intended no invidious com- 
parison, Dr. Brill. But, as orienta- 
tion progresses, you will better un- 
derstand what I mean. Have you 
ever thought how your science 
would appear to an extra-terrestrial 
mind?” 

“The concept has never occurred 
to me,” Lucifer snapped, thinking 
of the grotesque creatures running 
out of the rain, and the blindfolded 
child walking alone down the cor- 
ridor. “We see your science as a 
great number of cubicles, all op- 
erating within one structure, with 
a minimum amount of inter-com- 
munication. Each cubicle is en- 
grossed in a process of infinite 
abstraction from a body of potential 

32 



knowledge self-doomed to be finite. 
It studies every new idea chiefly in 
terms of concepts fundamental to 
its own specialized body of knowl- 
edge.” 

Huth waved a large hand to cut 
off a protest from Lucifer. 

“And what of the phenomena an 
individual scientist observes and 
evaluates? He shapes the facts into 
an hypothesis that may be valid 
only within his own cubicle. He 
does not venture outside, A most 
glaring example is that of your 
medical diagnostician. He uses the 
tools of his science brilliantly, then 
lays them down and becomes a 
therapeutic nihilist!” 

“Specialization has meant prog- 
ress,” Lucifer protested. 

“Progress, yes, but progress only 
to the frontiers of infinity. Will you 
dare venture into that frontier, Dr. 
Brill?” 

“Of course.” 

“Be careful! The price of that 
venture is very high. Consider for 
a moment your Earth biologist: 
The very nature of the subject on 
which he has founded his science 
eventually dooms him to technolog- 
ical unemployment! If he follows 
the living cells to their ultimate 
sequence of interactions between 
ions and molecules, biology ends as 
it began — as applied chemistry and 
physics!” 

Lucifer shifted uneasily. 

“From another value judge- 
ment,” Huth continued, “the ortho- 
doxy of Earth science is a product 
of its fragmentation. Within each 
cubicle, isolated from the fertiliza- 
tion of new concepts, the unortho- 
dox all too often and too soon can 



FRANK RILEY 




become rigidly orthodox. This is 
the circle around which each sci- 
ence seems forever to travel!’’ 

Lucifer felt himself being moved 
skillfully toward an unknown ob- 
jective. It was like being a Knight 
on a chessboard in the hands of an 
expert player. 

Huth moved in closer to his ob- 
jective. “And so it is with psi, Dr. 
Brill. Or so it appears to an extra- 
terrestrial viewpoint, which is now 
necessarily your own! Parapsychol- 
ogy had to depart from the physi- 
ology of orthodox psychology in 
order to get a look at itself. It be- 
came unorthodox avant guarde! It 
established a scientific case for psi, 
and for two decades thereafter es- 
tablished little else. What have you 
proved that Rhine did not prove 
twenty years ago?” 

“It is necess — ” 

“Already we see forming a dog- 
ma of psychic research, a cult of 
psychologizers that may match in 
exclusivity the cult of physiologizers 
— each declining to draw upon the 
resources of the other! We see a 
tendency to look backward instead 
of forward, a bemusement with the 
historical concepts of association 
theories, psychon systems and con- 
tinuums of cosmic consciousness — 
all of which suggests a turning 
away from the frontiers of infinity 
to an interminable abstraction of 
possibilities from your own finite 
knowledge. 

“Do you follow me. Dr. Brill?” 

Lucifer removed his glasses, 
breathed on them, polished them 
carefully on the sleeve of his tunic. 
He looked beyond Huth to the win- 
dow and the steaming tropical rain. 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



When his thoughts were composed 
again, he answered, “I follow you 
— with reservations.” 

“Naturally. Now consider this 
question : Have you looked into 
other cubicles of science for an- 
swers to psi?” 

“We welcome all viewpoints.” 
“Do you now? I wonder! From 
our extra-terrestrial viewpoint, it is 
evident that biology, chemistry and 
physics all have within their pres- 
ent finite bodies of knowledge the 
fragments of concepts that could 
propel psi, and hence all of science, 
into the very frontier of infinity.” 
Huth paused, looked searchingly 
at Lucifer. 

“Dr. Brill, are you ready to share 
your primacy in psi research with 
the physicial scientist?” 

“The physical scientist scoffs at 
us.” 

“He also is reluctant to leave his 
cubicle. However, by using the 
mathematical tools of logic to en- 
close psi research in a framework 
of anti-logic, built on the principle 
that man cannot know, your psychic 
theorist has alienated the handy- 
man physical scientist who has so 
much to contribute— but who in- 
sists that man must know.” 

Huth raised himself to his mag- 
nificent seven feet of height. 

“Let the thoughts germinate, Dr. 
Brill. This is only your first orienta- 
tion session. On the whole, we have 
made good progress.” 

He handed Lucifer a printed 
card. 

“This will instruct you how to 
tune in your visagraph to a closed 
circuit orientation program after 
the dinner hour. Do not fail to fol- 



33 




low instructions.” 

With the briefest of nods, Huth 
stalked toward the door, where he 
turned, as if in response to an after- 
thought. 

“Your motivations to progress in 
orientation will be several. Dr. Brill, 
but it may be well for you to know 
that you already have a hostage to 
the future success of our program.” 

“Hostage?” 

“Your first child, Dr. Brill. It will 
be born in approximately seven 
Earth months, according to the cal- 
culations of Dr. Thame. 

“Meditate on this while you 
await the attendant who will re- 
turn you to your quarters.” 



L ucifer tried to square his 
thin shoulders against the 
straight-backed chair. He ran the 
tips of his fingers over his upper lip, 
and out of the numbness that 
gripped his brain came a vagrant 
thought: His mustache really did 
need trimming; it wouldn’t do at 
all to let down about such things. 

The door clicked open. He 
turned, expecting to see one of 
Huth’s attendants, instead he faced 
Nina. Her cheekbones made two 
spots of white against her olive 
skin. 

“Hello, Lucifer,” she said. Her 
voice was even deeper, huskier than 
usual. 

Her tone and the way she used 
his first name told him she knew 
about the child. But he pretended 
not to notice. He couldn’t discuss 
the child until he had time to evalu- 
ate the meaning of it all. 

“Miss Poteil,” he began firmly. 

34 



His voice shook a little, and he 
started again, “Miss Poteil, I trust 
your first orientation session was 
not too unhappy an experience.” 

Her dark eyes were thoughtful, 
troubled. 

“What is unhappiness?” She 
shrugged in reply to her own ques- 
tion. “I am never sure about cross- 
ing the line between happiness and 
unhappiness. Are you?” 

She sat down facing him. 

“If your question philosophical 
or psychological. Miss Poteil?” 

She smiled faintly, and shook her 
head. 

There was silence between them. 
Finally she spoke again, “I saw the 
little girl as I came in.” 

“The girl with the blindfold?” 

“Yes. She stepped right past me, 
and went into a room just down the 
corridor. The room seemed to be 
full of children.” 

Lucifer stood up with sudden de- 
cision. “I believe I will try to look 
around.” 

The white spots grew in her 
cheeks. Her full, expressive lips 
tightened. 

“Be careful, Lucifer,” she said 
quietly. 

The long corridor was frighten- 
ingly deserted. With so many doors 
opening off it, the odds seemed 
overwhelming that someone would 
step out one of them at any mo- 
ment and challenge his right to be 
there. 

Lucifer’s plastic boots scraped on 
the metallic composition floor. 

A subdued tinkle of children’s 
voices drew him to a door some 
thirty steps down the corridor. The 
door appeared to be of a glass-like 

FRANK RILEY 




material, but it was opaqued. He 
pushed against it, and it moved. 
He drew a long breath, then inched 
the door open. 

A tall, bronzed women of Huth’s 
racial characteristics was grouping 
a dozen or so youngsters into an 
activity pattern. The children were 
all around five or six years old. 
Their fair skin and bone structure 
indicated they were offspring of 
Earth parents. 

The woman blindfolded one of 
the youngsters, a square-shouldered, 
blond little fellow. The she tossed 
a ball to one of the other boys, and 
gave a short command in her own 
language. 

The children scattered about the 
large room. The boy with the ball 
ran and stood against the window, 
which was blurred from the driv- 
ing rain. 

After chanting what appeared to 
be a number count, the blindfolded 
boy began to move around the 
room. As he approached one child 
after another, he would hesitate 
while still three or four steps away, 
shake his head and move on to 
someone else. 

Finally, when still some ten feet 
from the window, he swerved 
abruptly toward the boy holding 
the ball. He ran directly to him, 
grabbed him by the arm, then fum- 
bled for the ball and clutched it 
triumphantly. 

The other children broke into 
an excited babble, and everyone 
seemed to be clamoring for the next 
chance to be blindfolded. The 
woman looked disconsolately at the 
rain-streaked window, and began to 
blindfold another child. 



Lucifer eased the door shut. He 
moved on down the corridor, past 
room after room that seemed de- 
serted. A tentative testing of several 
doors proved they were locked. 

Near the end of the corridor, 
where it turned at right angles and 
headed down an equally long wing 
of the building, Lucifer found an- 
other room that sounded occupied. 

Again he inched the door open. 

This room was occupied by 
smaller children, mostly of pre- 
nursery school age. They were play- 
ing a version of a game Lucifer 
recognized from his own child- 
hood: Tail on the donkey. Only 
this donkey was a sinister looking 
creature with tiny ears and formid- 
able jaws. 

One by one the children toddled 
up to pin a stubby tail on his der- 
riere. Three of them hit the target 
with biological exactitude. The 
fourth missed badly. It was a little 
girl. When the others laughed, she 
tore off her blindfold, stamped her 
tiny foot. 

A bench sailed across the room, 
thudded flatly against the opposite 
wall. 

The children’s derisive laugh 
changed to one of excitement, and 
the girl felt encouraged to expand 
her tantrum. The bench caromed 
from wall to wall to ceiling and off, 
with a crash, into a corner. The 
woman attendant picked up the 
child by the shoulders and shook 
her. 

For an instant, wild defiance 
flared on the childish features. 
Then the girl pouted, and two tears 
trickled down her soft cheeks. 

Lucifer didn’t try to analyze his 

35 



PROJECT HI-PSI 




impressions. There would be time 
for that later. Now it was impor- 
tant only to gather as many facts 
as possible before he was detected. 

The second corridor contained 
many rooms. From the sound of 
the voices coming through the 
doors, and from spot-checking sev- 
eral rooms, Lucifer judged they 
were all occupied by children en- 
gaged in some form of play activ- 
ity that required psionic ability. 

At the end of the corridor, Lu- 
cifer opened a door and found 
himself staring out into the rain. 

Urged on by a growing eagerness 
to learn as much as he could before 
he was stopped, he ducked outside 
and ran across a mossy stretch of 
courtyard toward a second build- 
ing. 

Rain plastered his hair, and 
trickled down his neck, but his 
tunic and leggings seemed water- 
proof. 

The rain was hot and stinging, 
and the wind surged out of the 
forest with lashing force. Half- 
blinded, Lucifer stumbled over 
some unseen object. He sprawled 
to his knees. He got up, slipped 
again, and skidded int6 the partial 
shelter of a doorway. 

The door couldn’t be moved. 
Lucifer moved out into the rain 
again, and groped his way along 
the side of the building. 

He stumbled over something else, 
fell heavily. 

A hoarse outcry, lifting above the 
wind and the rain, brought him to 
his knees. Shielding his eyes, he 
saw that he had stumbled over a 
figure huddled in a corner of the 
building. The figure straightened 

36 



above him. Its movements were 
jerky, like a carpenter’s rule un- 
folding. 

It was one of the grotesque, mis- 
shapen creatures Lucifer had 
glimpsed on first approaching Cen- 
ter. Through the slanting rain, Lu- 
cifier could make out a gigantic 
head that bulged sickeningly and 
was utterly devoid of hair. The 
head sagged forward, flopped back 
again until it struck the wall of the 
building, then snapped forward. It 
had two blank eyes, a flattened hor- 
ror of a nose, a mouth that sagged 
and twitched. 

The mouth was trying to say 
something, but the words dissolved 
in a bubble of red saliva and a 
merciful wash of rain. 

The head flopped back and 
forth. The figure jerked toward 
Lucifer, lunged and fell on top of 
him. 

For the first time in his adult 
life, Lucifer lost control of himself. 

He screamed, and screamed 
again. 



H ands clawed him down, 

smashed his face into a chok- 
ing puddle of water and wet moss. 
The hands and arms beat against 
his back and ribs. Each blow was a 
flailing, uncoordinated effort, but 
the impact was crushing. 

Water bubbled into Lucifer’s 
mouth and nostrils. He raised his 
head to breath, and a random blow 
smashed it back down. He gulped 
air and water together. He choked, 
strangled. 

And then the weight was gone 
from his back. The hands and arms 

FRANK RILEY 




stopped smashing against his flesh 
and bones. Lucifer raised himself on 
his elbows, retched chokingly. 

A powerful pair of hands picked 
him up and half carried him out of 
the rain. Someone brushed back his 
hair, wiped his eyes. He opened 
them. A tall attendant held him up. 
Nina dried a trickle of water from 
his cheek. Her dark features showed 
shock and concern. Huth watched 
him sardonically. 

“It was fortunate your wife 
sensed your danger and helped us 
find you,” Huth said. “Your zeal 
for orientation is commendable. Dr. 
Brill, but I suggest you proceed less 
rigorously.” 

Lucifer took the handkerchief 
from Nina, wiped his mouth. It 
tasted salty. He attempted to stand 
with some measure of dignity. 

“Who or what was that crea- 
ture?” he demanded. 

“I think you have had quite 
enough orientation for the time be- 
ing,” Huth replied. 

The strange conveyance whisked 
them back to their bungalow. Lu- 
cifier soaked himself in a hot bath, 
and it was a long time before his 
trembling muscles relaxed. Dinner, 
via the tubicular, consisted of a 
meat dish, more strongly flavored 
than venison, two rather salty green 
vegetables and a flagon of warm, 
spicy amber liquid. They ate in 
silence. 

Soon after dinner, Huth ap- 
peared on the visagraph screen, for 
what he called their second orien- 
tation session. This was largely a 
development of the first, and so 
were those that followed on suc- 
ceeding days. Each left Lucifer feel- 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



ing more unsure of himself, tense, 
mentally adrift. The distance be- 
tween Melus and his safe, sectire 
little laboratory at Western Uni- 
versity was becoming greater than 
could be measured in light years. 

Ranging from geology to bio- 
chemistry, from physio-psychical 
sources of neurosis to what he 
called the “molecular site of under- 
standing”, Huth hammered inces- 
santly with semantics and logic 
against the carefully mortared 
bricks of Lucifer’s own scientific 
cubicle. Sometimes he spoke with 
almost mystical fervor of a frontier 
beyond a frontier, a science beyond 
a science. One evening, during a 
visagraph session, Nina suddenly 
interrupted : 

“Your words speak about the in- 
finite,” she murmured, “but your 
mind does not sing with the music 
of infinity.” 

Now, for the first time, Lucifer 
saw uncertainty on Huth’s face. 

Uncertainty, and a look of in- 
describable sadness. 

Then the visagraphs screen went 
dark. 

Nina was on the couch beside 
Lucifer. Her eyes were half- closed; 
her strong fingers were clasped 
around her knees and she rocked 
back and forth gently. 

“What a strange man,” she said. 
“What a strange and strong and 
lonely man. For a moment, I saw 
all the loneliness of the universe in 
his eyes . .” 

Lucifer regarded her uneasily. 
“You see many things, Miss Poteil.” 

“No, Lucifer, I see so very little. 
But what little I do see makes me 
feel like a blind person the rest of 



37 




the time. Isn’t it terrible to look at 
shadows?” 

“Really, Miss Poteil— ” 

“Hush!” 

She put her finger to his lips* 

He started. 

“Wha— ?” 

“Please, Lucifer — Oh, be quiet — 
Please!” 

Her breasts rose and fell sharply 
beneath the thin tunic. He saw the 
tendons stand out in her throat. 
Finally she whispered : “I think 
someone is coming to see us! To- 
night. Fm not sure ... Oh, this 
damned blindness!” 

She beat her fists furiously on her 
knees. 

Lucifer tried to speak casually: 
“If someone comes, we’ll know 
about it soon enough. Meanwhile, 
I suggest we try to get some sleep.” 

There was a strange weariness 
in her as she got up from the couch 
and started toward the bedroom, 
which Lucifer had sternly assigned 
to her after the first morning of 
awakening. But after a few steps, 
she stopped and turned back to 
him. 

“Lucifer, they say you are the 
father of my baby. If that is so, I 
am grateful.” 

It was the first time they had 
mentioned the child. Lucifer felt 
shocked, and very humble. This 
was another new feeling. He de- 
cided it would be wisest not to 
speak. 

“You are a man, Lucifer,” she 
went on, in her husky voice. “I 
knew it when you tried to take that 
test, knowing you would fail.” 

She brushed her lips across his 
forehead. 

38 



“Goodnight, Lucifer. I have 
known many males, but very few 
men. There is a great difference. .” 

He lay awake on the couch for 
a long time, his body aching for 
sleep, his mind spinning with 
strange thoughts, stranger concepts. 
He was just beginning to slip into 
the twilight zone between wakeful- 
ness and troubled sleep when a for- 
eign sound in the room jarred him 
awake. 

Forcing himself to lie completely 
still, to continue his even breath- 
ing, he strained to catch a repeti- 
tion of the sound; his eyes turned 
toward the rear window. The latest 
rain squall had swept by, and the 
window was now a luminous rec- 
tangle against a brilliant, star-filled 
sky. 

As his vision cleared and focused, 
he saw that the casement window 
was partly open. A fresh breeze, 
warm and fragrant with the odors 
of the rain forest, swept across the 
couch. 

Lucifer heard a definite, sharp 
click from the visagraph. It was as 
though a switch had been snapped. 
But there was no shadow of a phys- 
ical presence in the room. 

The bedroom door opened sud- 
denly. Nina stood there for an in- 
stant, silhouetted in her short, 
white nightgown. Then she moved 
quickly across the room, knelt be- 
side his couch. Her lips, warm and 
dry, pressed close to his ear; her 
long hair tumbled over his cheek 
and throat. She whispered: 

“Can I stay here a little while?” 

He nodded, and felt her body 
crowd against him on the narrow 
couch. 



FRANK RILEY 




They lay there together, breath- 
ing quietly, watching the open win- 
dow. 

And then there was a shadow 
there, a darker something against 
the darkness. Nina’s body stiffened. 
With an unconscious gesture older 
than remembered time, Lucifer put 
his arm over her. 

A voice spoke out quietly from 
the window. 

“It’s O.K. now. Dr. Brill.” 

A figure stepped through the 
window, stumbled over the hassock 
and sat on the edge of it. 

“You both there?” a man’s voice 
asked, then, without waiting for an 
answer, continued: “. Good! . 
Fetzer’s my name. Albert Fetzer. 
Remember me, Dr. Brill?” 

“I regret to say — ” 

“That’s O.K. It was a long time 
ago — when I was Gl-ing my way 
through electrical engineering at 
Western. You gave me a lot of card 
tests. I did pretty well, too — damm- 
it!” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“None of us blames you any- 
more. We were kind of bitter at 
first — now we’re glad you’re here.” 

“Glad?” 

“Sure. We’ve got a lot of things 
figured out, but there’s still a lot 
more we don’t get. You could be a 
big help to us.” 

“I sincerely hope so, but — 

“But, nothing, Doc. It looks like 
they’re really giving you the orien- 
tation business — like they need you 
and are going all the way this 
time!” 

Lucifer’s tongue felt dry, and 
difficult to maneuver. He was 



grateful that Fetzer didn’t seem to 
expect an answer. 

“They’ve been cozy with some of 
us before, but always cooled off. 
You just play it smart, learn all you 
can! But be careful, or you’ll end 
up with the Gooliesf' 

Fetzer listened intently, then 
chuckled. 

“I guess they’re still kind of 
fouled up! We had to warp the 
force field behind your place — 
shorted their magnetic track, too! 
But before they get here there’s 
something else I’ve got to warn you 
about — ’specially you, Mrs. Brill.” 
He hesitated. 

“What is it?” Nina prompted. 
“Well, when you think you get a 
message from us don’t bust out with 
it like you did a while ago. They 
pick up everything you say on that 
damn visagraph — I had to short 
the magnetic track in order to get 
at the control wire to block it off — ” 
“Just a moment, Albert,” Lucifer 
interrupted. “How did you know 
what was said in this room?” 
Fetzer sounded embarrassed: 
“Well, it’s a funny thing. Doc, 
but back on Earth we were all kind 
of ashamed of this psi thing. We 
tried to keep it hid from other peo- 
ple. Here, it’s different. We’re all 
the same way, more or less. So we 
try to use psi instead of hide it. 
Doesn’t work on Huth’s gang, 
though. They got minds like ma- 
chines — It’s like trying to psi into a 
quarter-horse motor!” 

There was a pounding of foot- 
steps outside the front door. 

“Gotta go!” said Fetzer. 

He twisted lithely through the 
window, closed it behind him and 



PROJECT HI-PSI 



39 




vanished into the sultry night. 

Nina slipped from the couch and 
hurried into the bedroom. 

The front door banged open. 
The room light flared on, blinding 
Lucifer. 

Huth was there, with two of his 
men. The men ranged about the 
place with giant strides, going 
through the living room, the bed- 
room and out into the rear en- 
closure. One of the men worked on 
the visagraph, trying to light it up. 
He had no success. 

Huth stood over Lucifer’s couch. 
“Has anyone been here?” he de- 
manded sternly. 

“If there was, he was more quiet 
and courteous than you have been,” 
snapped Lucifer. “Need I remind 
you that this has been a most ex- 
liausting day, and that to be awak- 
ened in this manner — ” 

“Mrs. Brill received a message, 
and informed you of it.” 

“Miss Poteil talks a great deal of 
nonsense, which you must also have 
overheard. However, I assure you. 
Sir, that I am not interested in her 
hallucinations, and if you are, I 
suggest you discuss them with her 
in the morning.” 

“What happened to the visa- 
graph.” 

“If I knew, I wouldn’t care. 
Your electronic gadgets impress 
me as being rather juvenile.” 

Huth bowed. 

“Perhaps because you do not 
understand them. Dr. Brill.” 

The warning in his voice was 
clear. He turned sharply on his heel, 
motioned his men out of the room 
and left, shutting the door quietly. 

40 



ITH BREAKFAST, the 
tubicular delivered a metal- 
backed manuscript that bore the 
scholarly title: “Genetics and Psi, 
with an Evaluation of Three Case 
Histories as Compiled from Earth 
Records.” 

Nina glanced at the title across 
the breakfast tray, then shifted her 
chair beside Lucifer’s. 

“I’d better read that, too,” she 
said. “Maybe it will tell us some- 
thing about our own genetics ex- 
periment.” 

Lucifer pursed his lips in disap- 
proval at her frankness, but he 
held the manuscript so that both 
could study it. The introduction 
began: 

“After studying the incidence of 
psi on Earth, we felt that the genet- 
ics approach should receive consid- 
erable concentration of effort. Our 
chemists, biochemists and physicists 
are naturally continuing their ex- 
perimentation, but the geneticists 
seem to promise the maximum re- 
sults in the minimum amount of 
time. If psi can be explained, un- 
derstood and propagated through 
genetics, it can no longer be mis- 
nomered ‘extra-sensory’. It will be- 
come no more ‘extra-sensory’ than 
sense of direction, sense of time 
and, in the case of musical aptitude, 
such component primary senses as 
sense of absolute pitch, sense of in- 
tensity, sense of harmony, sense of 
rhythm and sense of tonal memory. 
Thousands of tests have indicated 
that these musical senses may have 
an hereditary base.” 

“Physiologizers!” Lucifer ex- 
claimed, contemptuously. 

“Let’s keep our windows clean,” 

FRANK RILEY 





Nina murmured. 

He stared at her in surprise. 

“My father used to say that,” 
she explained. “He told us to keep 
our windows clean — so truth can 
look in and out.” 

Lucifer turned back the manu- 
script. He felt somehow chastened. 

After several paragraphs of fur- 
ther discussion on the hereditary 
aspects of the various senses, even 
including the inheritance through a 
dominant gene of the ability to 
taste, the manuscript went into a 
long analysis of the family trees of 
Arturo Toscanini, Kirsten Flagstad 
and the 19th century mystic, Daniel 
Dunglas Home. 

“Please note,” the manuscript 
emphasized, “that in all three fam- 
ily trees a favorable heredity and a 
favorable environment were per- 
fectly blended.” 

Nina gasped excitedly. 

“Oh, Lucifer — ^if this project 
can bring the right parents to- 
gether . 

“Human beings are not white 
mice!” Lucifer snapped! 

“They are on Mendel’s Planet!” 

Nina seized his hand. 

“Think, Lucifer! Our child may 
be able to see things we have never 
dreamed of seeing! We will teach 
him to use his eyes from the very 
moment of birth— even before!” 

Deep anger and resentment 
stirred within Lucifer, but before 
he could answer her, a click from 
the visagraph screen told them they 
were not alone. 

Huth’s usually calm voice be- 
trayed his excitement. His dark 
eyes glowed. 

“Mrs. Brill — ^how would you pro- 
PROJECT HUPSI 



pose to train a child so early?” 

“By encouraging him to use his 
own true senses rather than his su- 
perficial senses for his very first 
needs! My father raised all six of 
us and he used to say I was a good 
baby, because I never cried to be 
fed or changed. But maybe it was 
because he knew what I wanted 
and took care of me before I 
cried!” 

Huth insisted on sending for 
them immediately. There was a 
three-day-old Earth child at Cen- 
ter. Huth had the baby’s records 
before him when they arrived. 
Nina, flushed with eagerness, 
asked * 

“How is the baby fed?” 

Huth consulted a chart. 

“Both formula and breast. But 
it doesn’t appear that the mother 
will be able to nurse much longer.” 

“When is the next feeding time?” 

“In approximately one hour.” 

Huth took them to the nursery. 
Through the window, they could 
see that the baby was still asleep. 

The young mother was sitting up 
in her room. A tiny, thin-faced 
woman, she looked at them with 
alarm. 

“Is something wrong with my 
baby?” 

Nina knelt beside her chair. 

“Don’t you know your baby is 
all right?” she asked gently. 

“I — I thought so. But when you 
all walked in like this, I wasn’t 
sure.” 

Lucifer didn’t recognize this 
young woman; nor did she appear 
to recognize him. Her eyes, still 
dilated, roved apprehensively from 
face to face. 



41 




“YouVe not going to do some- 
thing to my baby?” 

Lucifer felt a great pity for this 
young woman, snatched away from 
Earth to bear a child with an un- 
known mate on this strange planet. 

“I wouldn’t harm your child,” 
Nina told her. “I’m from San Diego 
—how about you?” 

“Masselon, Ohio.” 

“Now tell me,” Nina asked, “is 
your baby awake yet?” 

The dilated eyes stared at Nina. 
“I’m . I’m not sure, but I don’t 
think so.” 

“That’s fine. Now, please don’t 
be scared. I want to help you and 
your baby. Do you trust me?” 

The young mother studied Nina 
unblinkingly. After an instant of 
hesitation, she nodded. 

“Thank you. Now, are you going 
to feed your baby yourself this next 
time?” 

“I’ll try again; but I haven’t 
been doing so well.” 

“Can you tell when your baby is 
starting to wake up?” 

“I thought I could the first day or 
so. But then I didn’t try — I guess I 
got used to having my baby brought 
to me every four hours.” 

“Is the baby usually crying when 
it is brought into the room?” 

The young mother smiled. 

“Oh, yes! She’s got a strong, 
healthy cry!” 

“Will you try to feed her this 
time before she cries, when she first 
tells you that she is hungry?” 
“What — what do you mean?” 
Nina took the young mother’s 
thin hand between her strong, 
brown fingers. “You know what I 
mean! Don’t be afraid to use what 

42 



God has given you! Let’s stop talk- 
ing now so you can keep your 
thoughts with your child!” 

Under the donunance of Nina’s 
personality, the woman settled back 
in her chair. 

Outside, the first rain of the 
morning swept over the forest and 
steamed up the windows. Huth 
stood statuesquely by the door, 
arms folded. The taJl nurse re- 
mained watchfully beside him. 

Lucifer struggled with an unac- 
customed inner turmoil. Dissecting 
the tangle of his emptions, he was 
astonished to realize that his pulse 
was thumping with excitement. 

Abruptly, the young mother 
spoke up. “My baby is hungry. She 
wants to be fed.” 

“Go feed her then!” commanded 
Nina. 

She helped the young woman 
from the chair. Together they led 
the way down the corridor. As they 
neared the nursery, Lucifer edged 
closer to them. He saw that the 
child was still asleep. The mother 
saw it, too. 

“But she’s still asleep!” she said, 
bewildered. “I thought — ” 

“Does a child have to be awake 
to tell of its hunger?” Nina asked 
gently. 

The young mother went ahead 
of them into the nursery. She took 
the child from the crib and cradled 
it in her arms. 

The baby stirred, grimaced. Its 
lips groped in small, sucking mo- 
tions. 

The young mother hesitated, 
then opened her robe and brought 
the baby’s lips to her breast. The 
child began to feed contentedly. 

FRANK RILEY 




At a gesture from Nina, the 
others left the mother and child 
alone in the nursery. 

When they were well down the 
corridor, Nina burst out triumph- 
antly, 

“The first contact! Child has 
communicated to mother. Message 
received and answered. Child has 
used primary sense of communica- 
tion, rather than learning to rely on 
secondary!” Nina squared her 
shoulders proudly. “My baby won’t 
have to cry to tell me that it’s 
hungry or cold or wet and miser- 
able!” 

Lucifer’s New England con- 
science prodded him. If indeed 
there was anything to this psi hered- 
ity business, then he had again hurt 
someone else, unknowingly, but 
deeply. What would Nina say and 
feel when she learned that he had 
no psi talent to pass on to their 
child? 

But this uneasy remorse con- 
flicted with another emotion in Lu- 
cifer: The sense of excitement that 
he suddenly realized had been lost 
somewhere back in the early years 
of his psi testing. Somewhere, some- 
time along the way the sense of 
wonder had gone out of his work 
and his life. The constant repetition 
of the same basic testing technique 
had made a familiar backyard out 
of — what had Huth called it? — the 
very frontier of science. 

Huth was speaking to him. 

“What do you think now. Dr. 
Brill? Could it be possible after all 
that the unorthodoxy of Earth’s 
parapsychology might have to be 
shaken from its own orthodoxy?” 

Lucifer frowned. 



“I do not want to split definitions 
with you. But it should be obvious 
to any scientific mind that Miss 
Poteil’s experiment, although in- 
teresting, was painfully inadequate 
in methodology. In the first place, 
can we determine whether the child 
was communicating a need, or 
whether a psi-positive mother had 
some precognition of her child’s 
need? In the second place, would a 
large number of children born of 
psi-positive parents react with sig- 
nificant differt ce from a similar 
number of children bom of psi 
negatives?” 

“A flash of lightning can be 
duplicated in the laboratory,” said 
Huth, “but it is still a flash of light- 
ning. We recognize lightning, we 
admit its existence, but we do not 
wish to go on proving forever in 
the laboratory that lightning is in 
fact lightning. If some of your 
earlier scientists had been content 
to do that, your cities would still be 
illuminated by oil lamps.” 

“A fallacious comparison!” 

“Not entirely sol I merely wished 
to make a point. It is all a matter 
of objective. You have seen how 
older children are developing their 
psi talents in our classes. Your wife 
may have shown us how to begin 
training at a much earlier age, 
when training is most important.” 
“Still, I should think you would 
require more substantiation, some 
further testing, to support Miss 
Poteil’s little experiment.” 

“Of course. Do you have any 
suggestions. Dr. Brill?” 

Once more Lucifer found him- 
self backed toward a corner. Only 
this time he did not try to escape. 

43 



PROJECT HI-PSI 




The challenge intrigued him, in 
spite of his determination not to be- 
come involved with this nonsense. 
A controlled experiment was quite 
a different thing . 

“I might have,” he replied, with 
an effort to be casual. He plucked 
at his mustache. “But you must 
grant that a valid basis for experi- 
mentation cannot be improvised on 
the spur of the moment.” 

“Improvise at your leisure, Dr. 
Brill.” 

Nina was sent off to continue 
orientation work with Dr. Thame. 
Lucifer was given a small cubicle 
near Huth’s office. It consisted of 
little more than a desk, a stool, 
three bare walls and a floor to ceil- 
ing window through which an or- 
ange rim of the planet’s great sun 
was now shining mistily. 

Lucifer scribbled notes, drew 
crude diagrams, tore them up and 
started all over again. Spots of 
color flushed his cheeks. Though he 
would not have made the admis- 
sion, he hadn’t enjoyed himself so 
much in fifteen years. He didn’t 
even notice when a new squall rus- 
tled across the wet jungle, blotting 
out the sun and drumming against 
the window. 

Huth came in with the attend- 
ant who brought lunch. 

“How many children are there 
here now?” Lucifer asked crisply. 

“I believe we have about thirty 
under the age of nine months.” 

“Do you have another nursery 
room, like the one we visited this 
morning?” 

“We have three more in the 
Maternity Division.” 

Lucifer explained his immediate 

44 



needs, Huth issued orders that 
three more babies be brought to tht 
Maternity Division. Each was in- 
stalled alone in a nursery. Two 
were placed in cribs, and soon fell 
asleep. The third, a boy of about 
eight months, refused to nap. He 
wasn’t happy until allowed to crawl 
around the floor, exploring the 
strange wonders of the nursery. 
Lucifer made a quick procedural 
adjustment, and hoped the young- 
ster would stay awake until feeding 
time. 

He tried to tell himself, whenever 
he thought about it, that he was 
doing all this only to point up the 
absurdity of Huth’s theories. 

As feeding time neared, three 
bottles of heated formula were 
brought in warmers and placed at 
Lucifer’s direction in rooms imme- 
diately adjacent to each of the 
nurseries. Two of the children were 
still asleep; the third had discov- 
ered a pack of disposable diapers 
and was systematically tearing it 
apart. Dr. Thame joined them to 
watch the experiment, and he 
brought Nina along. Her eyes 
sparkled with interest and under- 
standing as she watched Lucifer’s 
preparations. After one quick nod, 
he did not look her way again, and 
he stifled the thought that Nina 
would be watching the experiment 
with their own child in mind. 

One of the babies stirred in its 
sleep, and whimpered a little. 

“Normally,” explained Dr. 
Thame, “a child of this age would 
awaken shortly and begin to cry.” 

The baby squirmed again, then 
turned toward the room in which 
one of the bottles had been placed.

Its tiny lips worked in a sucking 
motion. 

^‘How wonderful!’’ whispered 
Nina. 

Lucifer picked up the bottle, 
moved slowly into the corridor. 

The child appeared confused. Its 
eyes screwed up tightly, and its face 
reddened. Then it jerked its head 
toward the new position of the bot- 
tle and repeated the sucking mo- 
tion. 

Nina, who had followed Lucifer, 
squeezed his arm in excitement. He 
gave her the bottle, and she hur- 
ried into the nursery to reward the 
child. Its lips groped eagerly for 
the nipple. 

By this time, the second child 
was stirring. Its reactions were 
much slower, and more uncertain, 
than those of the first baby, but 
they followed the same pattern. 

Nina went on to the third child, 
which had been left playing on the 
floor of the nursery. 

‘‘Lucifer! Come quickly!” she 
called. 

The child had crept over to the 
wall nearest the room in which its 
bottle had been placed. It was paw- 
ing, bewildered, at the rough sur- 
face. 

Ducking below the window edge, 
Lucifer picked up the bottle and 
moved it to the other side of the 
room. 

For a moment the child looked 
like it was about to cry. But it 
hitched around on its knees, 
sprawled flat, raised up again and 
crawled across the floor. When it 
was midway to the other side of 
the nursery, Lucifer switched the 
bottle back to its original position. 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



The child continued its forward 
progress for a few feet, faltered 
and stopped. Its red button of a 
nose wrinkled, and two big tears 
squeezed down its round cheeks. 

Nina rushed into the nursery, 
picked up the youngster, cooed over 
it and thrust the nipple of the bot- 
tle between its anxious lips. 

“My compliments. Dr. Brill,” 
said Huth. “Does this begin to sat- 
isfy your laws of probability?” 

Lucifer was determined not to 
show his excitement. He shrugged. 
“Five thousand more tests might 
prove something — providing you 
counterposed 5,000 tests on chil- 
dren whose ancestry was psi nega- 
tive.” 

“We’re not interested in psi nega- 
tive children. Dr. Brill.” 

Lucifer faced him squarely. 

“Just what are you interested in? 
I think we are entitled to an ex- 
planation.” 

Huth hesitated, then nodded. 

“Perhaps you are.” 

W HEN they were settled in 
Huth’s office, he stood by the 
window and folded his huge, 
bronzed arms. 

“My home planet,” he began, “is 
also in the system of Capella. We 
are an old race, but neither deca- 
dent nor degenerative. Our phys- 
ical sciences — as you can judge 
from your presence here — are at 
least 500 orbits beyond the outer- 
most probings of science on Earth.” 
He paced across to the door, and 
back to the window again. 

“But in our obsession and fas- 
cination with the ever new horizons 



45 




of physical science, we neglected 
that which was potentially of far 
greater significance. We ignored 
the possibilities of psionic evolution 
— we ignored them until it was al* 
most too late!” 

“Too late,” breathed Nina. “Is 
that why your mind feels like a ma- 
chine?” 

Huth inclined his massive head 
in her direction. 

“That could be why, Mrs. Brill. 
What society — or our bodies — neg- 
lect will eventually die. It is tnie 
even of psi. Dr. Brill.” 

“Can you be specific?” Lucifer 
challenged. 

“I can. If you had taken your 
eyes out of the laboratory long 
enough to look at your world as it is 
and has been, you would have 
learned that psi manifestations 
were quite customary on Earth dur- 
ing the 13th and 14th centuries. But 
your industrial age did not have 
much room for psionics. With 
Daniel Dunglas Home went the last 
of your great psi talents!” 

“Our card tests have discovered 
many psi positives,” Lucifer inter- 
jected heatedly. “You ought to 
know — you have many of them 
here now!” 

“Psi positives with thwarted, ar- 
rested or frustrated talents,” re- 
plied Huth. “Psi positives who 
wanted to be ‘normal’, because 
that is what society demanded. 
Psi positives who were ashamed of 
their talent and quite willing to 
have it overlooked! Yes, we have 
them here . and, what is more 
important, we have their less in- 
hibited children!” 

“Your logic escapes me.” 

46 



“It wouldn’t if you had emerged 
from your cubicle and looked 
around you among the physical sci- 
ences. Some of your more venture- 
some geneticists believe that man 
will soon be the master of his 
heredity and that the next five mil- 
lion years of evolution on Earth 
will be the controlled evolution of 
the human mind. That could mean 
controlled evolution toward psi. Dr. 
Brill — if Earth science can ever es- 
cape the terrible drag of orthodoxy 
and if the unorthodox can ever 
learn to avoid the trap of its own 
dogma.” 

Nina had been watching Huth 
with the unblinking intensity that 
was so characteristic of her in mo- 
ments of total concentration. 

“So we are your nursery!” she 
exclaimed. “We produce the plants 
that will bring life back to your own 
soil!” 

Huth came close to one of his 
rare smiles. “You have admirably 
reduced the milleniums and mathe- 
matics of evolution to a single sen- 
tence!” He turned to Lucifer. “Is 
this a laboratory big enough to 
challenge you?” 

Lucifer took refuge in a question 
of his own. “What about your 
Goolies?^* 

From the shadow on Huth’s face, 
and the faint gasp from Nina’s 
parted lips, Lucifer knew he had 
made a mistake. 

“Where did you learn that 
name?” Huth asked him coldly. 

Lucifer was not a good liar, but 
he tried. “I — I don’t really know. 
Perhaps — from one of your nurses 
or drivers . 

“We will accept that explanation, 
FRANK RILEY 




for the moment. Later, I trust you 
will volunteer another.” 

Huth’s emphasis on ‘Volunteer” 
was almost imperceptible, yet it 
had the effect of two pieces of steel 
striking together. 

“You have already met one of 
these — Goalies, Let us go and meet 
some more. 

Nina put out her hand. “Is this 
necessary?” 

Huth regarded her thoughtfully. 

“Yes, I believe it is. If we are go- 
ing to work together, you should 
know everything.” 

“And if we’re not?” Lucifer 
snapped. Huth shrugged. “Then it 
won’t make any difference, I assure 
you.” 

Outside, the wet moss of the 
courtyard was springy underfoot. 
Lucifer flinched with the remem- 
bered horror of trying to breath 
through that moss and water. 

Nina took his hand. Her fingers 
were strong and warm. 

A tall attendant let them into the 
building. Lucifer looked down a 
long, sterile-white corridor, flanked 
by small, seemingly transparent 
doors. 

“The doors are transparent only 
from this side, and then only when 
subjected to the proper wave fre- 
quency to make them so,” Huth ex- 
plained. 

“Like the rooms we live in!” 
Nina burst out. 

Huth blinked, and assented, 
“Like the rooms you live in.” 

Before Lucifer could assimilate 
this bit of information, Huth had 
stopped before the first door. 

Inside was a shrunken monstros- 
ity of a creature. It had the torso of 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



a grown woman, but its legs were 
bone thin, twisted and scarcely 
eighteen inches long. It was hair- 
less; its face was one ovular blob 
of flesh, in which the eyes, mouth 
and nostrils were knife-edge slits. It 
seemed to be watching the rain- 
streaked window. 

There were two beings in the 
next room, apparently male and 
female. Both were naked, and 
seated cross-legged on a thick mat. 
They were playing a complicated 
game with marked and colored 
blocks. The woman’s body was cov- 
ered with a fine, brown hair. Her 
breasts were tiny for the dimensions 
of her body. Her head was also 
small out of all proportion, as was 
the male’s. Lucifer saw that though 
both were eyeless they were playing 
their game rapidly and skillfully. 
Their hands were lumps of flesh, 
with just rudimentary fingers. 

“They are quite sentient,” Huth 
observed. And he added with pride, 
“You would classify them as defi- 
nite psi positives — altogether our 
most successful experiment of this 
type!” 

As they neared the next door, it 
suddenly became opaque. Huth led 
them past it without comment. 
Nina winced, and her fingers tight- 
ened convulsively. 

They were led quickly down the 
rest of the corridor. Some of the 
doors were opaque. Through others, 
they caught glimpses of more 
grotesquely distorted creatures, 
some asleep, some lurching or 
crawling about their rooms. 

The corridor ended in a large 
multi-purpose type of room in 
which semi-human creatures of all 



47 




shapes and sizes were milling about. 

Huth opened the door. “Go on 
in,” he said. 

It took all of Lucifer’s will to 
control his revulsion and trembling 
and step through that door. Nina 
followed. Her fingers rigid in his 
hand. 

One of the creatures nearest 
them turned nimbly around on one 
leg and hopped closer. It reached 
out a long arm, touched Nina’s 
forehead. A harsh, croaking sound 
came from its mouth. Nina’s lips 
quivered, but she smiled and patted 
the leathery hand. 

Others bounded and crept 
around them, jibbering, feeling 
their faces and hair, probing at 
their bodies with stumps of arms or 
with hands that seemed all fingers. 

“All of these people show some 
traces of psi,” Huth explained. 
Again there was quiet pride in his 
voice. 

A wracking cry came from one 
corner of the room. A huge shape 
hurtled into the group around 
them, knocking others out of its 
way. Lucifer saw the wildly flop- 
ping head, then long arms reached 
for him and a crushing weight bore 
him to the floor. There was a chok- 
ing odor of hot, oily flesh. 

And then the weight was gone. 
Two attendants led the creature, 
still mouthing angry cries, out of 
the room. 

Huth helped Lucifer to his feet. 
“You must forgive Tetla. He shows 
up well in some basic psi tests, but 
certain other faculties were lost in 
the manipulation of his chromo- 
somes. We never quite know what 
he will do.” 



The other beings had fallen back 
in silence during the assault. Now 
they began to babble in wild dis- 
harmony, each gesticulating in its 
own way. 

Lucifer’s cheeks were grey, but 
his lips were compressed into a thin 
line under the stubble of his mus- 
tache. He took Nina’s arm and 
strode out of the room. Huth fol- 
lowed, without comment. 

Out in the corridor, Lucifer con- 
fronted him. A sweep of his arm 
encompassed the long corridor, the 
room they had just left. 

“This — this is a monstrous in- 
humanity — a terrible perversion of 
science!” 

His voice was flinty with rage. 
Deep within him, the conscience of 
his puritan ancestry was revolted. 

Huth raised an admonishing 
hand. “Don’t forget your scientific 
training. Dr, Brill. You can’t im- 
pose the value judgements of one 
culture upon the framework of an- 
other.” 

“There must be certain principles 
basic to all cultures!” 

“A true Aristotelian fallacy! 
Form is actual reality, matter is 
potential reality and the form is 
ever in the matter! Surely, Dr. Bill, 
you can rise above such ontology!” 
“Can you justify what you have 
done to these people even from 
your own value judgement basis?” 
“You treat justification as a valid 
entity, which leads you deeper into 
the morass of attempting to sub- 
stantialize abstracta. We do not 
justify, we do! Let me clarify: 
“With the future of our evolu- 
tion in the balance, with the un- 
bounded horizons of the universe

that will be opened by psi, we have 
taken certain measures. Once we 
postulated the genetic characteris- 
tics of psi, there was no limit to 
possible methodology. You have 
seen only two of many methods we 
are exploring: One, of course, is 
the Earth project; the second is an 
attempt to induce psi mutations in 
the offspring of certain of our own 
people. Naturally, since the ex- 
ternal results of such experiments 
are often unpleasant, we bring the 
newly born infants directly to our 
laboratory on Melus. 

Nina’s eyes were still wide with 
horror. 

“How do you do this thing?” 

“Really, Mrs. Brill, it’s nothing 
to be so shocked about. As a mat- 
ter of fact, it’s only a further step 
in what your own experimenters 
do by exposing Drosophilae to 
X-rays and plants to colchicine. We 
are endeavoring by many methods 
not only to mutate a gene by re- 
arranging the atoms in its mole- 
cules, but also to increase the quota 
of chromosomes in certain cells. 
The difficulty, as yet, is to single out 
the right string of chromosomes or 
to hit the right gene and influence 
it toward the desired psi mutation. 
We are still groping in the dark, 
simply increasing the chances that 
one or another gene, at random, 
will psi mutate.” 

As Huth spoke, he had been 
leading them toward a side exit. A 
vehicle was waiting. Huth put his 
hand on Lucifer’s shoulder. 

“We did not bring you to Melus, 
Dr. Brill, merely to reproduce your 
own psi characteristics. We feel 
that your background will enable 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



you to make many notable contri- 
butions, once you become oriented. 
Already you have justified this feel- 
ing. Your people will do things for 
you and Mrs. Brill that they would 
not willingly do for us.” 

“I want nothing more to do with 
this project.” 

“I am sure you will recognize 
your present reaction as purely 
emotional, and come quickly to 
realize that here you have the an- 
swer to a true scientist’s dream — a 
laboratory on the scale of life itself! 
For twenty years you have taken 
timid steps around the periphery of 
your science. Now you are at the 
heart of it!” 



HAT should he think? 

What should he believe? 

What should he do? 

Lucifer walked slowly around 
the small clearing behind their 
quarters. He stared, for the most 
part unseeingly, through the force 
field and into the shadows of the 
forest. 

His shoulder brushed the invisi- 
ble barricade, and the shock broke 
the rhythm of his stride. 

What should he believe? 

This question bubbled most fre- 
quently to the roiled surface of his 
thoughts. With belief would come 
the mental framework, the pattern 
for action. It was disturbing and 
confusing that credo should be so 
important to a scientific mind. 
Couldn’t facts take form without 
credo? Did facts shape the frame- 
work, or were they molded to con- 
form to it? Einstein made truth 
relative to its own framework, but 




49 




which came first — the framework 
or the truth? And if the answer 
was framework, could there be 
truth? Perhaps the childhood rid- 
dle of the chicken and the egg 
could have cosmic implications. A 
vagrant phrase from a long-ago lit- 
erature class came back to prod 
him now: To an egg the chicken is 
merely the means of producing an- 
other egg. Samuel Butler. 

A shaft of sunlight speared down 
through the whispering canopy of 
branches high above him. It kin- 
dled to life a spot of riotous color 
in the perpetual shadow world at 
the base of the great trees. Blos- 
soms of delicate blue, petals flecked 
with orange and gold. Leaves so 
green they brought an ache of lone- 
liness for a forgotten spring morn- 
ing of youth. 

What should he believe? 

With sudden percipience, Lucifer 
knew that he had moved in the 
shadows for a long time. The riot- 
ous dreams of youth, the exciting 
sense of being a pioneer among 
pioneers, had become like a bit of 
stop-motion film. It preserved the 
form, without the life or action. A 
dream cannot be framed and kept 
behind glass. It cannot be static. 
To remain, it must change. 

Parapsychology had been the 
high road. The glorious adventure. 
It had made the son of a New Eng- 
land minister an explorer on a new 
frontier. But does a frontier of sci- 
ence have purpose other than to 
lead to an infinite succession of new 
frontiers? Had he remained too 
long on one frontier? 

The unorthodox becomes the 
orthodox. The theory crustifies into 

50 



the dogma. The method becomes 
methodology. Was this forever to 
be the entrapment of science? 
There were an infinite number of 
exploratory possibilities on this 
frontier of today; and, for all their 
challenge, they could be a soporific. 
The frontier itself was finite. But 
what about the next frontier? And 
the next? And the next? 

Huth could be right, in this at 
least: Perhaps parapsychology had 
been too long exploring the un- 
known of its present frontier. Some 
must remain behind to develop 
and consolidate. But others must 
keep moving on! 

To look forever beyond the next 
horizon! There was the challenge. 
There was the dream forever 
bright. 

Lucifer thought of his crude ex- 
periment with the psi positive chil- 
dren, and he admitted now what 
he had denied at the time : Not for 
a decade had he been so excited by 
any experiment ; it had brought 
back the wonder of the moment 
when an aimless undergraduate 
had first come upon the Rhine card 
tests. Lord, that was more than 
twenty years ago! For twenty years 
he had been walking in Rhine’s 
shadow. And his personal, private 
dreams had never lived to see sun- 
light. 

When would science learn to use 
genius without being smothered by 
it? Freud and Einstein had left a 
vision to their sciences, not a cita- 
del. They had tried to cast a light, 
not a shadow. Rhine had brought 
psi into his laboratory to demon- 
strate its scientific validity. Now, 
the physicist, the biochemist, the 

FRANK RILEY 




mathematician and, yes, the geneti- 
cist — all of them, must take this 
validity into their own laboratories. 
The parapsychologist must become 
the physical scientist; the physical 
scientist must become the para- 
psychologist. Only from the total 
crucible of science could psi emerge 
in a useful form. 

But what of Huth, and Mendel’s 
Planet? 

However it had been brought to- 
gether, whatever one thought of it, 
this living laboratory was now a 
fact. Psi was being mated to psi; 
children were being born, children 
with a psi potential that could be 
trained into a power of unknown 
magnitude. Huth had described it 
well: A laboratory on the scale of 
life itself! 

Huth knew his semantics, all 
right. The barbs of his words got 
under the skin, hooked and held 
fast. How pallid an Earth labora- 
tory would seem after Mendel’s 
Planet. The symbol cards seemed 
to have lost their meaning. 

A dozen projects clamored to 
reach the surface of Lucifer’s think- 
ing. Each cried out its siren chal- 
lenge; each demanded experimen- 
tation. How much there was to do 
here on Mendel’s Planet! 

Now, Nina was at his side, and 
she said gently, “It’s raining again, 
Lucifer. Won’t you come in?” 

The rain had returned, and the 
big, splashing drops hadn’t fallen 
into his thoughts. But they were 
coursing in streams down his 
cheeks, dripping from his eyebrows. 
He brushed them away, and stared 
at the forest. The shadows had 
merged. The flowering beauty was 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



like a mirage that had never been, 
and never could be. There was only 
the wash of the rain on the forest 
roof, the drip-drop-drip on the 
molding carpet of dead leaves. 

A lbert FETZER came back 
that night. The click in the 
visagraph, the deeper blackness of 
the walls, the silent opening of the 
casement window — these were the 
now recognizable signs of his com- 
ing. 

Lucifer hadn’t been able to sleep. 
Nina had already gone to bed, after 
pressing her lips to his cheek in a 
swift gesture that left him more 
unsettled than ever. 

When he realized that Fetzer was 
coming, Lucifer sat up on the 
couch and drew the sheet around 
his shoulders. In a moment the 
stocky figure squeezed through the 
window. 

“Hi, there,” Fetzer called softly. 
“You awake. Dr. Brill?” 

“I haven’t slept.” 

“How’d things go today?” 

How had things gone? 

“I’m not sure,” Lucifer evaded. 
“You got it all figured out?” 
“Well — not exactly.” 

Lucifer was stunned at his own 
reluctance to discuss matters with 
Fetzer. Anything less than total 
frankness was a new facet of him- 
self. It was one he didn’t like. But 
how could he share his indecision? 

“We had an organization meet- 
ing after I left here last night,” 
Fetzer said. “All the section leaders 
made it this time. We’re set to pull 
the plug any time you say?” 

“Pull . Oh, I hadn’t realized 

51 




. What do you think you can 
do?” 

“Plenty. We’ve learned to short- 
circuit the force fields in a hurry, 
and we can spring over a thousand 
men inside of two minutes. Within 
five minutes more, we’d be able to 
hit Center and the landing field.” 
Lucifer felt himself withdrawing 
even more. He could see the whole 
psi project swept away in turmoil. 
Then he thought of Huth’s men, 
so towering in their stature, so well 
organized, so completely equipped 
by a fantastically advanced tech- 
nology. The revolt would be brutal- 
ly crushed. 

“You can’t do it!” he told Fetzer. 
“Huh?” The stocky figure tensed. 
“Spell it out. Doc.” 

“You wouldn’t have a chance!” 
“We’ve got a few tricks. There’s 
a lot of vets in this bunch.” 

“It would be suicide.” 

Fetzer hunched closer to the 
couch. 

“Maybe it would, maybe it 
wouldn’t. But a man can’t always 
stop to think of things like that. 
You do what you got to do.” 

The words triggered a release, 
and Lucifer started to talk. 

With an eloquence that would 
have astounded his graduate stu- 
dents at Western University, Lu- 
cifer drew a word picture of the 
psi project and the theory behind 
it. As he talked, Nina came in 
quietly and sat on the couch be- 
side him, drawing up her knees in- 
side her short gown. 

Lucifer spoke of their own ex- 
periments with the babies, and of 
the sweep of five million years of 
evolution foreshortened through 



understanding and application of 
Hardy’s Law. Only when he came 
to the radiation and chemical 
phases of the psi project, to the 
pitiable Goolies, did his flow of 
words falter. He tried to pick up 
quickly with analysis of what train- 
ing would do for their own chil- 
dren. But the nagging awareness of 
this second dishonesty, the knowl- 
edge that Nina knew what he had 
done and was watching him in the 
darkness, broke the flow of thought 
and his explanation trailed off into 
awkward silence. 

Albert Fetzer didn’t say any- 
thing. He squatted on his heels, a 
humped blur in the darkness of the 
room. Lucifer could feel the probe 
of his eyes and darting mind. 

“So that’s it,” Fetzer said at last. 
“We guessed some of it, but we 
couldn’t fill in the missing pieces. 
You learned a lot. Doc.” 

“There’s so much I haven’t yet 
learned.” 

“You learned enough.” 

“Enough for what?” 

“We’re going to pull that plug, 
remember?” 

“No!” Lucifer stood up in his 
agitation. “There must be another 
way — a better way.” 

“You name it.” 

“Well — naturally I’d have to 
think more about it. Everything 
here is so new to me.” 

Fetzer stepped closer to him. His 
shadow was shorter even than Lu- 
cifer’s, but it bulked with unseen 
strength, 

“Anything else, Doc?” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“You’ve gone for this stuff, 
haven’t you.” 



52 



FRANK RILEY 




Lucifer recoiled from the blunt- 
ness of the question. 

“I am a scientist,” he replied. 
“Or at least I have always assumed 
that. These ideas are as strange to 
me as they are to you, but Tm try- 
ing to understand and evaluate 
them. Isn’t that important?” 

“Not to me it isn’t — not right 
now. I think the other boys will 
feel the same.” 

“You don’t care what all this 
may mean?” 

“Nope. Not yet, anyway. I’m not 
a scientist. Dr. Brill. Maybe I’m 
not even a very smart guy and 
maybe I’m just as glad of it, be- 
cause my feet are on the ground 
and I know where I want them to 
go. Sure, this psi stuff could be big, 
mighty big. Our kids could go a 
long way with it. I can see that. 
But I’m a man, not a guinea pig. I 
happen to go for the woman they 
teamed me up with, and she feels 
the same way about me. That’s 
true of most of the folks here. But 
we’re not breeding kids for some- 
one else. We’d rather run our own 
show. Guess you professors have 
been away from ordinary people 
too long to realize that. You should 
listen to some of our boys who 
fought with the underground in the 
last war. Makes you feel kind of 
good about people.” 

“Don’t you realize that Huth can 
destroy all of you?” 

“I’m not the hero type. Dr. Brill. 
In the war, I always kept my head 
down and squeezed as deep in the 
mud as I could. But there’s some 
things you have to do, no matter 
how cold your stomach feels about 
it.” 



“When do you plan to do this?” 
From the forest came a wild, 
plaintive cry. Fetzer took a quick 
step toward the window, then 
paused. 

“You better come with me — ^both 
of you.” 

Lucifer drew back. 

“Where? Why?” 

“I don’t like to do this. Doc. But 
I don’t like the way you sound, 
either. We can’t take any chances.” 
“You don’t think . .” 

“I don’t know. I’m sorry, but I 
don’t know enough about your 
kind. Hurry up, now.” 

Lucifer still held back, but Nina 
stood up and moved wordlessly to- 
ward the window. Fetzer’s voice 
toughened. 

“Make it easy on yourself. Doc. 
You’re coming along, one way or 
the other.” 

His legs shaking, Lucifer fol- 
lowed Nina through the window. 



T he warp m the force field 
was at the far comer of the en- 
closure. At a command from 
Fetzer, they dropped to their knees 
and crawled through. A voice whis- 
pered a challenge. Fetzer answered, 
and they proceeded, single file, 
deeper into the forest. The leader 
guided them with a pinpoint of 
light escaping from his cupped 
hand. 

They followed a winding course 
around the root structures of the 
trees. Lucifer tripped once and fell 
sprawling into the wet, leathery 
leaves. As he got up, the spider loop 
of a vine caught him around the 
throat and flipped him again.

“Pick up your feet and keep your 
head down,” Fetzer warned impa- 
tiently. 

Their direction took them to a 
shallow stream, and they splashed 
up the middle of it for a hundred 
yards. The cacophony of night 
sounds retreated before them, 
closed in behind them. The roof- 
top of intermeshed branches and 
leaves dripped endlessly. Some 
alien creature followed them 
through the branches, yapping in a 
strident monotone. 

They emerged from the stream 
to crawl into a semi-cave formed 
by the enjoining roots of two great 
trees. Vegetation had webbed over 
the roots until even the dropping of 
water was cut off. 

The light of a guttering torch 
showed several men waiting for 
them. A few carried strange weap- 
ons stolen from Huth’s men. Others 
were armed with vicious looking 
clubs, and long, needle-pointed 
stakes. 

It’s fantastic, thought Lucifer. 
Cavemen prepared to challenge a 
mechanized force. Cavemen forty 
light years from home. 

When they saw Nina, the men 
stood up, surprised, uneasy. Fetzer 
went into some detail on what 
Lucifer had told him. One of the 
men swore, and smashed the head 
of his club on the sodden floor of 
the cave. 

A balding man seated Nina on a 
hummock in one corner of the cave. 
Ignoring Lucifer, they plunged 
into discussion of their plans. None 
could see any reason for further de- 
lay. The supply ship had been gone 
for some time, and might return 

54 



soon. Its crew would add strength 
to Huth’s base force, which num- 
bered around eight hundred, in- 
cluding nurses, doctors and various 
technical personnel. 

To Lucifer, the plan sounded 
bold. Pathetically bold. A sizeable 
group would break out of their 
quarters and flee into the forest, 
drawing a portion of Huth’s men 
in pursuit. Another group would 
attack Center, making it appear 
that this was the chief point of con- 
centration. After delaying as long 
as possible, the main force would 
hit the landing field and try to 
capture the auxiliary spaceship. 
The men knew they couldn’t han- 
dle the ship, but their work around 
the field had taught them enough 
about it to know that its armament 
could give them control of the 
base. 

As Lucifer listened, a sense of 
familiarity kept tugging at him. It 
was a strange sensation that he had 
been through something like this 
before. But that was ridiculous. 
He’d never been any closer to mili- 
tary action than rejection by his 
draftboard, which had stupidly con- 
sidered parapsychology non-essen- 
tial. 

The feeling persisted, and sud- 
denly he identified it: Hempstead 
House, New London, Conn. The 
stories he had been told in child- 
hood about the underground rail- 
road and the abolitionist meetings 
held by the few who believed men 
should be free and were willing to 
do something about it! 

The memory came to him across 
thirty-five years of his life, and 
half the span of the galaxy. It came 

FRANK RILEY 




with an impact that snapped some- 
thing inside him, to bring the entity, 
the changing personality that was 
himself, into focus again. But it 
wasn’t the same focus as before. It 
would never be. Yet he felt more a 
whole person than ever before, and 
within him there was a surging 
current that could not be held back. 

Hempstead House had been a 
verity that could not be fitted into 
any neat cubicle of orthodoxy. New 
England ministers and spinsters, 
businessmen and farmers — all of 
them motivated by a life force that 
couldn’t be duplicated in any lab- 
oratory. The same life force was in 
this tree cave tonight, far away 
from Earth. It would go with men 
forever, through all space and time. 

It would go with Lucifer Brill, 
too — to the end of this experience, 
to whatever new frontiers of science 
he might live to reach. It would 
prevent the vision from becoming 
the still-life picture, the theory 
from crystalizing into dogma. As 
long as the force lived in any man, 
it had the potential of leading all 
men to freedom. Psi was an un- 
known part of that life force. It 
could not always remain in the lab- 
oratory. It must bring freedom 
from blindness, freedom from the 
cubicles that restricted each man, 
each science. It was a weapon • • . 

A weapon! 

Good Lord, why not? 

Lucifer stepped into the center 
of the group before he knew what 
he was going to say. But the words 
came: “Wait . there may be a 
better way — if you have the cour- 
age to try it!” 

Fetzer eyed him sceptically. 
PROJECT Hl-PSi 



“We don’t have much time. 
Doc.” 

“Then you must make time! It’s 
your only chance — our only 

chance!” 

The men were silent, uncertain. 

“Go ahead,” Fetzer said. “But 
make it fast.” 

“Would you fight with a knife if 
you had a machine gun? Would 
you attack on horseback if you had 
a jet loaded with atom bombs?” 

“Keep talking,” said Fetzer. 

“The answer is obvious. You 
would use the best weapon avail- 
able. Yet here you sit with clubs 
and wooden spears, ignoring a 
weapon so p>otentially powerful that 
it makes our H-Bomb, or some un- 
doubtedly greater weapon of 
Huth’s, seem like an old crossbow!” 

He had their attention now. He 
felt the force of concentration on 
his words. He sensed the awareness 
in Nina, though her eyes were hid- 
den in the shadows beyond the 
wavering circle of torchlight. 

“Think of what I learned from 
Huth — what Albert Fetzer has told 
you. Every person was brought here 
because they were psi positives, be- 
cause they possessed some individ- 
ual psi talent. Some of you have 
been ashamed of that talent. Per- 
haps you tried to hide it back on 
Earth — ^because it made you differ- 
ent from other people. But you 
know something about it. You may 
have learned more about it — even 
experimented with it — during your 
months and years on this planet. 
You may know what even limited 
talents have done in perception, 
clairvoyance and the moving of ob- 
jects through telekinesis. 



55 




“These things were done by in- 
dividual people, operating, as we 
might say, on single generators. 

“But now for the first time in his- 
tory we have more than three thou- 
sand psi talents grouped together in 
one small area. 

“What if all the psi power here 
could be focused on one objective? 
All the men and women of Men- 
del's Planet — all the children — es- 
pecially the children! . focusing 
their combined power! 

“Wouldn’t that give us the force 
of three thousand generators — ^fused 
into one unit? Instead of moving a 
chair across the room, making a 
table jump, levitating a person — 
why couldn’t a building be moved? 
A spaceship crushed? An attacking 
force cut down like grass under an 
invisible mower? 

“Gentlemen, is there any limit 
to the power of a psi focus? 

“If a psi focus is possible, we 
have our own world to win — the 
frontiers of infinity to explore . • 

“Are you willing to try?” 

The silence within the tree-cave 
lasted for an eternity. 

Even the breathing of the men 
was hushed as each struggled with 
this new concept. 

His emotional fire spent in the 
greatest effort of his life, Lucifer 
stood limp and awkward in the cen- 
ter of the circle, looking around at 
the set faces. Their eyes were fixed 
on the humus beneath their crossed 
legs. 

Faintly, high above the tree-cave, 
the wind moaned over the forest 
canopy, and a new wash of rain 
approached. It was a cold sound, 



though the night was steaming hot. 

There was a stir in the shadows, 
and Nina stepped between two men 
to join him in the circle. Her fists 
were clenched. 

“What’s the matter,” she cried, 
“don’t you have faith in yourselves? 
Are you afraid to fight with a new 
weapon?” 

The faces turned up toward her. 

“Look at that torch!” she com- 
manded. “Now, put it out! All of us 
together put it out!” 

She turned toward the torch, 
which had been thrust into a 
fibrous root structure. She half- 
closed her eyes. Her lips stretched 
taut; her fingers knotted and un- 
knotted in an agony of concentra- 
tion. 

The flame flickered violently in 
the still air of the cave, but it did 
not go out. 

“You’re not helping me!” Nina 
cried; “I’m not strong enough 
alone — none of us are! Please!” 

Abruptly, the torch twisted in its 
base, the wood snapped with the 
crack of a rifle shot. 

The tree-cave was dark. 

Nina’s voice was spent, triumph- 
ant. 

“See! Now do you have faith in 
yourselves? Didn’t you feel what 
Dr. Brill meant by a psi focus? 
Think of what it will be like to be 
in a focus of three thousand minds! 
Are you still afraid?” 

A man groped his way to the 
broken remnant of the torch. He 
re-lit the upper portion. 

“I’m thinking of my own kid,” 
he said. “I’ve seen what he can do 
all by himself.” 

Fetzer spoke up. 



56 



FRANK RILEY 




“Fve tried it myself. I can’t do it 
always, but sometimes it happens. 
I don’t know why, but it happens.” 

One after another the men spoke 
out, digging into hidden memories 
for some personal or observed ex- 
perience. 

“My wife was a kick,” recalled a 
scrawny little man with a huge 
nose. “Not the woman I got me 
now, but the one I had back in 
Portland. She never would read no 
cards, but when she got mad, all 
hell would bust loose! Once we 
both got mad the same time, and 
you never saw so much stuff zing- 
ing around! The neighbors called 
the cops.” 

They fell silent again, thinking. 

Nina slipped her hand into Lu- 
cifer’s. It was icy cold. 

“You’d better sit down,” he told 
her. 

She shook her head. 

Then Fetzer spoke up. 

“How could we try this thing, 
Doc?” 

It was the question Lucifer had 
been hoping for, and fearing. The 
problems ahead were piling up. He 
was a teacher, a scientist, not a 
leader. But he couldn’t let his 
doubts show now. 

“We can test it tomorrow night 
— ^if you can get word to all the 
people by that time.” 

“We can,” 

Once committed, the men 
plunged quickly into new plans. 
The guard tower on the hill be- 
hind the compound was picked for 
the first target. Almost everyone 
could see it from their own quar- 
ters. And it was large enough to 
provide a valid test for Lucifer’s 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



psi focus theory. The searchlight 
that always blazed on with the 
coming of dusk would be the signal. 

“If it works,” said Fetzer, “we’ve 
got to be ready to go all the way. 
They might not know what hap- 
pened exactly, but you can be sure 
they’ll move in and clamp down 
fast.” 

It was decided that a modified 
version of the original attack plan 
would be followed if the experi- 
ment succeeded. Only this time the 
diversionary forces would hit the 
Center and the small spaceport, 
while the main effort would be con- 
centrated on getting the rest of the 
people into a clearing just outside 
the compound. From there they 
would try to function as a psi unit. 

The wail of a forest animal 
drifted through the night. 

“The boys are getting ready to 
short the field again,” Fetzer ex- 
plained. “We’d better get back.” 

He held out his hand to Lucifer. 
“Sorry, Doc.” 

They made good time back to 
the compound, and the group split 
up as they approached it. Fetzer 
took Nina and Lucifer to their 
quarters and showed them how to 
locate the warp. 

“So long,” he said. “Good luck to 
us all.” 

Nina and Lucifer ducked 
through the warp, but did not go 
immediately inside. They watched 
the clouds shred apart, and the in- 
credibly brilliant stars light up the 
night. 

“I wonder where Earth is?” 
Nina whispered. 

“We couldn’t see it if we knew.” 

“Do you think we’ll ever get 

57 




back, Lucifer?’’ 

“I don’t know.” 

She slipped her arm through his. 

“Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but 
I have a feeling that we won’t. 
That we will never see our own sun 
rise again.” 

He was silent, feeling the weight 
of her words, the unknown to come, 
the burden of his responsibility. 

“It was hard for me to say that,” 
she continued quietly. “I loved 
Earth. I loved its beauty and its 
ugliness. I loved its poor blind peo- 
ple. I loved them all, for I was part 
of them, and my eyes belonged to 
them. I could never hate anyone.” 

She put her cheek against his, 
and her breath was warmer than 
the warmth of the night. 

Lucifer did not draw away. He 
asked, “Do you have a sense of 
what may happen tomorrow?” 

“Only a sense of much pain. Be- 
yond that, I can’t see. It may be 
just as well. Are you afraid, Lu- 
cifer?” 

“A little.” 

“It is good to be a little afraid, 
always.” 

“What about you — are you ever 
afraid, Nina?” 

It was the first time he had 
spoken the name of this strange 
woman who bore his child. 

“I am afraid, but I am at peace, 
too. If we do not come through 
this, there will be nothing more to 
the end of time. But if we do, we 
will have a child who can see, and 
its life will belong to us. Isn’t that a 
wonderful thought?” 

Lucifer trembled under the 
added burden, but he thrust it from 
his mind, lest she perceive it there. 

58 



Time enough for her to know the 
truth when they knew the future. 
“We’d better go in,” he said. 
Her cheek turned. Her mouth 
found his. 



W HEN HUTH called them 
shortly after breakfast, Lucifer 
was already at work in front of the 
visagraph screen. He held up a 
sheet of scribbling, and forced him- 
self to speak with animation. 

“Here are some further possibil- 
ities based on our findings of yester- 
day. Can we work on them here 
today?” 

Huth looked interested. “Along 
what lines are you proceeding. Dr. 
Brill?” 

“All the primary needs and func- 
tions of a child could be related to 
psi, just as well as the feeding. I 
am intrigued by the possibility of 
stimulus and response in the pre- 
natal stage. Mrs. Brill believes she 
has heard or read that thumb-suck- 
ing begins within the womb. Could 
you verify this with Dr. Thame? If 
it is indeed the case, the need ex- 
pressed by the foetus in sucking its 
thumb might be ansv/ered psionical- 
ly by a perceptive mother, thus 
strengthening the psi sense and 
building reliance on it at an even 
earlier stage of development.” 
“Splendid, Dr. Brill!” 

Lucifer pointed to the stack of 
books beside him on the couch. 

“Earlier this morning, I asked 
for some works on the infant brain, 
and several books on electroence- 
phalography were delivered by the 
tubicular. In scanning them, I find 
several items that may be fruitful 

FRANK RILEY 




for future research. For example, 
electrodes attached to the belly of 
a pregnant woman in the eighth 
month of gestation record an irreg- 
ular pattern of delta waves. It also 
appears that both delta and theta 
are typically infantile rhythms, and 
that dieta activity is early associ- 
ated with such non-visual stimula- 
tion as pleasure, pain and frustra- 
tion. The pathways on this frontier 
go in many directions.” 

“Follow them where you will!” 
There was deep satisfaction in 
Huth’s voice. “May I say. Dr. Brill, 
that I have misjudged the potential 
adaptability of the Earth scientific 
mind, when it is given proper 
stimulus and motivation. Your 
progress has been remarkable, truly 
remarkable! Would you be con- 
tent to return to your old cubicle?” 

“No,” Lucifer answered steadily. 
“I would not.” 

The day dragged endlessly, even 
with the research to occupy his at- 
tention. It might have been easier 
if he could have talked with Nina 
about what lay ahead, but he dared 
not risk a chance word being moni- 
tored. They could only try to talk 
casually about themselves and the 
research. 

As the minutes crawled by, new 
doubts tormented him. Would 
Fetzer and his men be able to con- 
tact everyone? Would the people 
believe enough in their own power 
to make a serious attempt at focus- 
ing it on the guard tower? If the 
test failed, he had no doubts that 
the men would go ahead with their 
original plan. 

Nina smiled whenever their eyes 
met, but for all its strength her 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



dark face showed the strain of wait- 
ing. Near the end of the day, she 
sat beside him, brushed her lips 
against the edge of his mustache, 
and let them creep up to his ear. 

“I love you,” she whispered. “I 
want to say it now, and then think 
only of what we must try to do.” 

Rain came with the first of dusk. 
It had been holding back since 
mid-day, building up rolling black 
thunderheads. Now it came with 
such fury that it blotted out the 
view of the compound and the 
guard tower. Nina looked stricken. 

“The signal!” she whispered. 
“What will we do?” 

Lucifer could only stare through 
the rain-washed window and re- 
peat to himself the fragment of a 
prayer he had learned from his 
father. 

With deepening of dusk, the rain 
lifted a little, but they still couldn’t 
know whether the light would be 
visible. A sudden gust could blot it 
out. 

Huth called on the visagraph. “I 
will send a car for you,” he said.” I 
thought it might be pleasant to dine 
together and pass this miserable 
evening in stimulating conversa- 
tion!” 

“Thank you,” said Lucifer. He 
hoped his concern didn’t show. 
From the comer of his eye he could 
see Nina by the window, straining 
to catch the first glimpse of the sig- 
nal light. 

He must delay Huth in sending 
for them! 

Lucifer picked up a book. 

“I will bring this along,” he said. 
“This afternoon I encountered an- 
other concept that may help . * 

59 




As he had hoped, Huth could 
not resist the bait. 

“That’s most interesting, Dr, 
Brill.” 

“It has to do with what might be 
called the relationship between the 
anatomical maturing of the brain 
and the changing of rhythm pat- 
terns as the child grows older. This 
has not been applied to psi pat- 
terns — ” 

“By all means, let’s discuss it, Dr. 
Brill! Now—” 

“Another factor,” Lucifer con- 
tinued desperately, “may be the 
alpha rhythm patterns in a child. 
While these emerge very infre- 
quently below the age of three, and 
do not appear with regularity until 
around the age of eleven, there is 
evidence to indicate that alpha 
rhythm characteristics are heredi- 
tary, and that . 

As Lucifer talked, he saw that 
Nina’s body had become rigid, that 
her fingers were extended and 
shaking, with the frenzy of a drown- 
ing person trying to reach some- 
thing just beyond his grasp. 

. and that environmental fac- 
tors may affect the frequency of 
alpha rhythms during the period 
of childhood. For example, two 
uniovular twins — ” 

A cry of pain escaped from 
Nina’s lips. Huth showed he had 
heard it. 

“Is something wrong. Dr. Brill?” 

“Mrs. Brill may have fallen — I 
will—” 

And then it came, more a rend- 
ing than an explosion. It was like a 
gigantic steel beam snapping apart 
from an irresistible pressure within 
its molecules. 

60 



Their dwelling and the ground 
beneath it shuddered. 

Nina cried out again, a cry in 
which agony and triumph were 
one. 

Huth leaped back from the 
screen. A terrible rage was stamped 
on his bronze features. 

“Dr. Brill, if you are responsible 
for whatever has happened . .” 

The screen went dark. 

Lucifer rushed to the window, 
tore Nina away from it. He caught 
a glimpse of white flames in the 
darkness. 

“Hurry! Through the warp!” he 
shouted. 

She followed woodenly, in a state 
of psychic shock. Her head struck 
the edge of the warp. Lucifer had 
to make her bend in order to get 
through. 

The drenching rain revived her 
a little. 

“Oh, Lucifer ... It hurt me so 
... I tried so hard . .” 

She was sobbing, and her tears 
became part of the rain on her 
cheeks. 

“It was like trying to swim 
against the tide of all the oceans in 
the universe. And the tide was 
pushing me back — and then, all of 
a sudden, the tide was with me — 
and I was tumbled and choked — in 
breakers as high as the stars.” 

She pressed hard against him, 
her strong body contorting in a 
spasm that was more than muscu- 
lar. Words tore themselves from 
lips that quivered and twisted: 

“Dear God! We’ve never lived 
before! A new world, and we’re not 
strong enough to live there, Lucifer 
— Not strong enough yet! I can’t go 

FRANK RILEY 




back to it — but I want to — I want 
to so much.” 



HEY SKIRTED the com- 
pound, just within the fringe 
of the forest. As they ran, other 
shadow forms joined them in the 
scramble toward the meeting place. 
Children, awed momentarily to si- 
lence, ran nimbly ahead of their 
parents. A baby wailed. 

Seachlights probed through the 
rain, thrusting at the forest. Blocks 
of light and shadow flickered be- 
tween the trees. It was like a film 
running wild in its projector. 

The light in the bow of the 
spaceship blazed on, and the misty 
twilight became a phosphorescent 
glow, a great dome of brilliance 
that arched up to the churning 
black clouds. 

A shouting came from the direc- 
tion of Center. The first attack 
group had struck. 

Sounds of the second attack 
came from the area of the space- 
ship. The dome of light shimmered, 
then steadied, with eye-aching 
brightness. The second diversionaiy 
group, the one led by the little man 
with the huge nose, was now en- 
gaged. 

The clearing opened ahead. It 
already teemed with activity. Fetzer 
and his sector leaders were chan- 
neling all comers into groups of 
about fifty, each under one of the 
leaders. The groups were fanned 
out along the edge of the clearing, 
facing toward the compound. Ex- 
cept for the muted crying of the 
very young, and the low-voiced 
commands from the sector leaders, 

PROJECT Hl-PSI 



the groups were quiet. 

Fetzer ran to Lucifer. 

“Better stay with me. This is your 
show from now on! Just tell me 
what you want us to do, and ITl 
pass the signal along. My God! Did 
you see what happened to the 
guard tower?” 

“Some of it.” 

“Do you think we can do any- 
thing like that again?” 

Lucifer looked over the nearest 
group. Many of the adults showed 
the same shock he had seen in Nina 
The children were no longer so 
awed, and their eyes were strangely 
bright. 

“I don’t know what we can do 
again,” he answered. “And I’m not 
sure I want to know.” 

The clearing filled rapidly. Each 
sector leader’s group was separated 
by about ten yards from the next, 
and all formed an uneven, convex 
line some four hundred yards from 
end to end. 

“All set. Doc,” said Fetzer. He 
fired a cylindrical weapon, and a 
streak of orange light curved over 
the compound. 

“That’s to give our boys a chance 
to get back into the woods — those 
that still can. They’ll be ready to 
hit again — if this other thing 
doesn’t work.” 

He waited for orders. 

Lucifer stared across the com- 
pound. The fear in his stomach 
made him feel like retching. These 
people were waiting for him to 
lead! Incredible. 

“You have to go on now,” Nina 
said. 

His stomach was still sick, but he 
managed to smile at her. Through 

61 





the slackening downpour he saw 
the bare walls and flat roof of Cen- 
ter. 

“The Center/’ he told Fetzer. 

Word leaped from group to 
group. Center. Center. Children 
picked it up excitedly. 

“Now/’ said Lucifer. 

Fetzer brought his arm down 
sharply. Lucifer saw the people 
around him pull themselves to- 
gether for another effort. Nina 
looked faint. 

Nothing happened. 

Most of the children were bounc- 
ing with excitement. They still 
hadn’t joined the psi focus. Lucifer 
ran up to a freckle-faced boy of 
about five. 

“Let’s have some fun/’ he said. 
“Blow up Center just like you did 
the guard tower!” 

The words rippled from child to 
child, spoken and unspoken. Now it 
was a game instead of an awesome 
duty. Hey, Tommy, this is going to 
be neat. Blow up Center! Wow! 
Watch me. Aw, you aren’t so hot! 
Quit shovin’, will ya’? I can’t see. 
Center. Blow up Center! Oh, boy! 

Lucifer gripped the freckled boy 
by the shoulders. 

“All right,” he said, “you show 
them all . Now!” 

The boy’s eyes glowed brighter. 
He’d show ’em. Right here in front 
of Mom and Dad. You bet he 
would! Just watch. 

As child after child joined the psi 
focus, each grew quiet. 

In some deep center of his being, 
Lucifer had the sense of a dark, 
rushing wind, a nightmare sense of 
falling into a void, and screaming, 
though you knew you would never 

62 



reach the bottom. 

Once again came that rending 
crack. Center disintegrated. There 
were no flying fragments. Just dis- 
integration. A white light that was 
whiter than light. 

The children buzzed ecstatically. 
Their parents were numb and si- 
lent. 

Lucifer knew that if Huth still 
lived, he must be reorganizing his 
concept of what had originally hap- 
pened. His reasoning would soon 
bring him to the truth. 

There was a period of quiet. It 
strengthened in Lucifer the belief 
that Huth was alive and calmly di- 
recting the operation. He found 
himself hoping that Huth, indeed, 
was alive. He had a respect for the 
man that bordered on a sense of 
kinship. 

The quiet was broken as Huth’s 
men fanned in small groups 
through the compound. They 
moved with great, leaping strides. 
One squad probed toward the 
clearing. When its leader realized 
how many Earth people were as- 
sembled there, he signalled for a 
quick retreat toward the spaceship. 

Again there was stillness. 

“What now. Doc?” asked Fetzer. 
He looked five years older. “Shall 
we blast that ship before it opens 
up on us?” 

Lucifer shook his head. 

“I don’t think it will open up— 
not just yet. This project means too 
much to Huth. He’ll try to save as 
much of it as possible.” 

Once more groups of Huth’s 
men scattered through the com- 
pound. This time the groups were 
larger. They followed converging 

FRANK RILEY 




courses that would end at the clear- 
ing. 

“They’re rushing us!” cried 
Fetzer. 

“Stop them!” 

The command leaped from sec- 
tor leader to sector leader. Lucifer 
picked up the freckled boy so that 
he could see across the compound. 

“Now we’ll have some more 
fun,” he said. “Those men are try- 
ing to get here. Let’s see if you can 
stop them.” 

“Betcha we can!” 

Stop ’em! Stop ’em! 

Word of the new game spread 
psionically from child to child, and 
was repeated vocally. One tiny girl 
bounced up and down in glee, 
dancing, first on one foot and then 
the other, as if she were skipping 
rope. 

A shrill whistle launched the at- 
tack. Five squads converged on the 
clearing. The bronze faces of 
Huth’s men were impassive. Their 
long legs covered nearly three yards 
at a stride. Each man carried a 
short, silver-colored tube. 

Once again the adults were first 
to project themselves into psi focus. 
But this time the children were not 
so slow to join and reinforce them. 

The rain had stopped. The hot, 
humid air was motionless. 

And it was a motionless wind 
that seemed to strike Huth’s men. 
They were swept off their feet and 
spun around as if caught in a tor- 
nado. The huge leader of the squad 
bearing down on Lucifer’s sector 
shot backward in a rising trajectory 
that cleared the compound. He 
screamed once. A hoarse, wild 
scream. 



The freckled boy in Lucifer’s 
arms clapped his chubby hands. 

Some of Huth’s men smashed 
into dwellings and fell in broken 
heaps. Others landed in open 
spaces and rolled like tumbleweeds. 
The survivors crawled or ran, 
screaming and sobbing, toward the 
spaceship. 

“We’d better get that ship now!” 
Fetzer urged. 

“Perhaps Huth will try to talk to 
us first.” 

Five minutes passed. No sign 
came from Huth. 

“They’re up to something,” said 
Fetzer. “Let’s not wait anymore.” 

The gates of one of the adminis- 
tration training buildings swung 
open, and the Goolies poured out, 
driven and prodded by their at- 
tendants. They came straight to- 
ward the clearing, running in 
weird, disjointed strides or bound- 
ing along on footless stumps of legs. 
Monstrous heads rolled loosely, 
snapping from shoulder to shoul- 
der, from chest to back. Tiny, hair- 
less, eyeless heads were fixed and 
rigid. Slack mouths gaped and 
drooled. Lipless mouths bared per- 
petual smiles. Dwarfed, naked crea- 
tures bumped against the knees of 
eight-foot giants. 

It was an unbelievable synthesis 
of every nightmare since time be- 
gan. 

The freckled boy wrapped his 
arms around Lucifer’s neck. His 
small body shuddered. 

Lucifer felt his own stomach 
twist with the remembered horror, 
but he held fast to reason. The 
Goolies were in themselves no dan- 
ger. It was only their psychological 

63 



PROJECT HI-PSI 




effect. Huth was shrewd. He knew 
well the Earth framework of preju- 
dice. If they could break up the psi 
focus, his own men could crash in 
behind them. 

Confinning this line of reason, 
Huth’s men were forming again on 
the outskirts of the compound. 

“Don’t let them reach the clear- 
ing!” he told Fetzer. 

Fetzer v/aved his signal. Though 
shaken, the adults, too, responded 
to reason. They tried to focus. 
Children pressed against their legs, 
sobbing. 

A focus seemed to form, but 
weakly. It was like an exhausted, 
distraught athlete trying to pull 
himself together. 

The Goolies faltered, appeared 
to lose some momentum and bal- 
ance. The attendants drove them 
forward again. They came on as 
though wading against a strong 
current. 

“Don’t be afraid,” Lucifer told 
the boy. “They really can’t hurt 
you.” 

The small body continued to 
tremble. 

“Try to stop them . try!” 

“I want my Mommy . .” 

Nina took the boy into her own 
arms. She cradled his face against 
her breasts, pressed her lips to his 
cheek. 

“Just keep your eyes closed,” she 
cooed gently. “Everything is all 
right now.” 

She stroked the wiry red hair, 
and murmured. 

“You don’t have to look to stop 
them, do you? Why, you can stop 
them any time you want to! Let’s 
tell all the other boys and girls to 

64 



keep their eyes closed — and stop 
those people so they can’t hurt 
Mommy and Daddy! Here, I’ll 
help you — we’ll do it together.” 
Nina pressed her cheek tightly to 
the child’s, and closed her eyes. The 
boy stopped trembling. 

The Goolies slowed. It became 
harder and harder for them to 
move against the invisible current. 
An attendant picked up one of the 
smaller creatures and hurled it for- 
ward. In midair, the Goolie re- 
bounded and knocked the attend- 
ant off his feet. 

The psi current broke loose. 
Clusters of bodies flew in all direc- 
tions, like the exploding fragments 
of a grenade, crashing in and 
through the metal walls of the 
compound buildings. 

And then all was still, except for 
a few broken moans. They were 
the loneliest sounds Lucifer had 
ever heard. 

He saw Huth, palms out- 
stretched, walking steadily toward 
the clearing. 

“Let him come,” said Lucifer. “I 
will talk to him.” 

They met about thirty yards in 
front of the clearing. Huth’s bronze 
features were chiseled deep with 
new lines. 

“Dr. Brill,” he said, “I am 
shocked and disappointed. I 
thought you had come to believe 
in this great experiment.” 

“There is no longer a question 
of belief — ^its success to this point 
is very obvious.” 

“Then why do you destroy it?” 
“I am trying to save it.” 

“I don’t understand,” said Huth. 
But there was hope in his eyes. 

FRANK RILEY 




“You have learned much about 
Earth and its people, but there is 
one thing you failed to learn : Man 
may be blind, warped and preju- 
diced, but his frameworks can be 
changed, and he must — above all — 
he must control his own destiny. 
This law has been proved so often 
through our history that I am sur- 
prised you missed it.” 

Huth bowed his head to ac- 
knowledge the rebuke. 

“Then what do you see in the 
future of this project?” 

“I see great problems, almost in- 
surmountable obstacles; and the 
threshold of a vast unknown. I see 
our people slowly approaching that 
threshold — to find their own 
future.” 

Huth looked silently over the 
compound, over the shell of the 
project to which he had dedicated 
his life, and not even his tremen- 
dous will could keep his shoulders 
from sagging. 

“I cannot say that I truly dis- 
agree with you. Dr. Brill. But my 
own culture views this project from 
its own framework. I, too, had to 
fight with prejudice to keep it go- 
ing. We are a mighty race, in con- 
trol of a great section of the galaxy, 
and I doubt that you could hold 
out against our full power, as you 
have done tonight against a frag- 
ment of it on this isolated outpost.” 
“There seems to be a new power 
on this tiny planet. A power greater 
than any of us can yet conceive,” 
Lucifer answered calmly. 

“That may be; but there is the 
extreme likelihood of its total de- 
struction before you can find out 
how to use it. I could not prevent 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



this destruction if I tried — once it 
is known what happened here to- 
night. My people, too, have a des- 
tiny, and they are determined to 
pursue it.” 

A great rumble, a mighty rush of 
air, swept them off their feet. The 
spaceship rose in a straight vertical 
line and leveled off some five hun- 
dred feet above the clearing. Its 
prow swung toward the Earth peo- 
ple. A finger of blue flame probed 
downward. 

Huth heaved himself to his feet. 

“No! No!” he shouted. “Oh, you 
fools ...” 

The blue flame broadened at its 
extremity, until it resembled a long, 
inverted funnel. When it touched 
the ground, it reduced to grey ash 
a fifty foot area of buildings and 
trees. There was no burning, no 
odor, no smoke. Just a sifting of 
ashes that fell like snowflakes. 

Huth cried out in agony at this 
destruction of his dream. He ran 
toward the path of the flame, wav- 
ing his arms. 

In the instant before the flame 
reached him, Huth stood motion- 
less, arms outstretched, face strain- 
ing upward, the great muscles of his 
neck standing out in rigid cords. 

And then his statuesque body 
was a sifting handful of grey ash, 
falling gently to the damp ground. 
The flame leaped forward. 

Lucifer got to his feet. He could 
think only one thought: That he 
must try to stand upright with as 
much dignity as possible. 

He heard Nina’s voice, but 
couldn’t make out the words. 

They were followed by a shrill, 
whistling sound. Surprisingly, the 

65 




sound grew fainter, like a siren fad- 
ing into the distance. 

Lucifer realized he had closed 
his eyes. He opened them and saw 
the spaceship streaking upward. It 
tumbled end over end, out of con- 
trol. The blue funnel of flame 
whipped in wild circles, hissing 
against the clouds. The ship dis- 
appeared momentarily behind a 
cloud bank, then could be seen 
again, glowing with an incandes- 
cent brilliance. 

Suddenly it burst into a shower 
of sparks that flared like a dying 
meteor, and fell away into nothing- 
ness. 

In the clearing behind Lucifer, 
children chattered gleefully. 

L ucifer stood by the window 
and listened in silence as Albert 
Fetzer made his report. 

The Earth people had returned 
to their quarters. Those whose 
dwellings had been destroyed or 
badly damaged were sheltered with 
friends for the night. Fifty-three of 
Huth’s men and thirty of the wom- 
en had survived. A score of Goolies 
had come crawling and whimper- 
ing out of the forest. All were put 
under guard in one of the training 
buildings. Dr. Thame, his own 
shoulder smashed, was helping with 
the injured. 

A twenty-four hour guard was 
set up to watch for return of the 
supply ship, or any other that 
might come. 

“What about the children?” 
Lucifer asked. 

“Mostly asleep. Some of them got 
a little frisky and started knocking 

66 



over things — until their mothers 
marched them off to bed.” 

Lucifer shivered, and he was not 
cold. 

“You’d better get some sleep,” 
he told Fetzer. “We’ll meet with 
the section leaders early in the 
morning.” 

When Fetzer was gone, Lucifer 
remained by the window. Nina 
came out of the bedroom to join 
him. Together they watched the 
clouds close out the stars, listened 
to the sweep of the rising wind and 
the drumbeat of the returning rain. 
The eternal rain. 

“Our world,” said Nina. “Our 
new world.” 

Lucifer started to answer, then 
could not speak. The weight of his 
thoughts was too great a burden to 
ease with words. 

Nina put her arm around him. 

“A frontier must always be like 
this,” she said. 

But what a frontier! There were 
the physical problems of existence, 
with Huth’s administration and 
most of his technology gone. There 
was the moment when the supply 
ship would return, when a great 
fleet of ships might come to see 
what had happened to the project. 

Yet those problems seemed like 
foothills to the towering peaks 
ahead, rising in range after range, 
beyond the outermost perimeter of 
thought. 

As Lucifer stared into this un- 
known, he felt his mental stature 
shrivel to microscopic size. How 
could he, or any combination of 
men, offer leadership into such a 
future? If the project could sur- 
vive against the return of Huth’s 

FRANK RILEY 




people, what would keep it from 
disintegrating and destroying itself? 
How could a psi focus be channeled 
and used constructively? How 
could a professor of parapsychology, 
a professor who knew less about his 
subject than the youngest child on 
this planet, assail such peaks? 

And the children! A freckled boy 
whimpering in his arms. A boy with 
a potential power that was as yet 
beyond the imagination. Lucifer 
thought of a tiny child behind the 
wheel of a great diesel truck, speed- 
ing through the crowded streets of 
a city. Or a child toying with the 
fuse of a hydrogen bomb. Raise 
that capacity for destruction to the 
nth power, and then . 

God! 

Tonight, for the first time, the 
children had glimpsed how great 
their power could be. Tomorrow 
they would begin to play new 
games. Quickly they would realize 
that they were stronger than their 
parents and other adult authorities. 
How could such children be con- 
trolled, educated, guided to matur- 
ity? If there were problem ado- 
lescents on Earth, what problems 
lay ahead with adolescents who 
could hotrod among the stars? 

“But there are more than prob- 
lems,” Nina said, in a hushed voice. 
“A frontier means so much more!” 

His thoughts, so recently liber- 
ated from their cubicle, drew back 
with conditioned reluctance, then 
leaped toward those towering peaks. 
A free thought could surmount any 
pinnacle, and look beyond the prob- 
lems to the grandeur of the infinite. 

The view was of a magnitude 
and beauty beyond his capacity to 

PROJECT HI-PSI 



absorb. But small, incredibly won- 
derful details focused before him. 

Now he saw knowledge and 
knowing from all the universe pour 
into this steaming jungle planet 
through communication channels 
opened by a psi focus that could 
leap time and space. 

He saw knowledge and love and 
understanding transmitted outward 
again to fall like rain wherever 
there was parched earth. 

His mind drew back from the 
summit. It was enough to see, for 
an evanescent moment of wonder, 
just a fragment of what lay beyond 
the wild mountains. It was mad- 
ness to look too long. 

The future receded; the present 
returned. 

“I was there with you,” Nina 
said, breathlessly. 

He buried his face in the soft- 
ness of her hair and the warm 
curve of her throat and shoulder. 

He told her about himself, and 
their child. 

She was silent and still for a long 
time. 

“I must have known,” she said. 
“I must have known all the time, 
without admitting it to myself.” 

“Fm sorry, Nina.” 

Her strong arm tightened around 
him. Her answer was steady: 

“We must have hope, because 
there is so much to learn. But if our 
child cannot see . .” 

Her voice shook a little, then 
went on firmly, 

“. If our child cannot see, we 
must find a Braille for the psi- 
blind! And we will walk togeth- 
er ... as long as we can ... on our 
frontier ... of infinity.” • • •

resistance 



O N HIS WAY home from the 
concert, Perry Mansfield whis- 
tled a pleasant melody from an old 
Stravinsky classic. But then, trou- 
bled by his conscience and that of 
his psychiatrist, he stopped to study 
the program again. 

What was that modem sym- 
phony? Oh yes, “The Flivver”. The 
music was supposed to have its 
roots in antiquity when someone 
started converting the metal wealth 



of the earth on an assembly line. 
Those screeching noises were drill 
presses and lathes and automatic 
hammers. The syrupy melody was 
the saintly salesman who disbursed 
the wealth of gadget and machine 
like melted butter across the bread 
of the land. 

Perry tried to like it. But he 
didn’t. And that disturbed him. It 
meant his psychotherapy wasn’t 
working. Dr. Stone would mn him 



69 




through the mechanical analyzer 
again and scold over the results. 

His simple act of walking home 
instead of riding an anti-gravity 
putterseat labeled him as a misfit. 
But it seemed silly to rent a flying 
stool just to travel two blocks. 

The fact was, he liked to walk. 

Perry sighed, discouraged, as he 
waited for the fluorescent scanner 
to identify his insides and open his 
front door. 

It opened. The lights came on. 
Recorded music, somewhat tuned 
to his mood, poured from concealed 
amplifiers. 

And then he noticed the note 
clipped to the door. 

His hand trembled as he took it 
down. The beautiful pastel gray of 
the enclosing envelope was an 
anachronism itself, and therefore 
marked unmistakably its almost 
priestly origin. 

The platinum engraved card in- 
side said simply : 

A Master Salesman has chosen 
you for his next calL 

Perry placed the note carefully 
on a plastic table. He inhaled deep- 
ly and held it for a moment to 
steady his nerves. 

A Master salesman. No one of 
that stature had ever called upon 
him before. It was an honor like — 
like a mayor or a bishop. It meant 
he had attained top level on the 
universal measuring stick — an A- 
number-1 -plus-plus credit rating. 

The prospect should have satu- 
rated him with pleasure. But, like 
the sharp new music, it didn’t. 

This card also meant he was ex- 
pected to buy something. Some- 
thing big and expensive. And he 

70 



didn’t want or need something big 
and expensive. 

He wished they’d leave him 
alone. 

Perry clapped his hand to his 
mouth as though someone might 
have heard the thought. 

What was wrong with him any- 
way? He wasn’t a recluse. He 
wanted to indulge and enjoy the 
polished luxury of his world. He 
wanted to be conventional. He was 
young and handsome and tall and 
dark. He had a good job. He had 
a pleasant and comfortable legal 
arrangement with a girl in the next 
block. 

But truly, what he had was all 
he wanted. 

He glanced at the card on the 
table. He could always say no. It 
wouldn’t be easy, but he could say 
no. 

Perry thumbed through the 
Pulitzer prize winning work for 
2087 which had been delivered yes- 
terday as part of his book club sub- 
scription. He had seen it already, of 
course, in a dozen magazines and a 
hundred copies of his facsimile 
newspaper. It was the advertising 
copy for Cor-T-Zan foundation 
garments. But he didn’t need a 
corset and the spartan simplicity of 
the fragile, lovely words bored him. 

He switched on television. A 
phrenetic band was hammering out 
the new top jingle on the Hit Pa- 
rade: 

Tootsie gum, tootsie gum 

Ooh yum-yum, it^s touched with 
rum; 

Love that girl with eyes so hot^ 

TOOTSIE GUM hits the spot. 

HENRY STILL 




Perry switched off the set. 

He was alone. He could be hon- 
est with himself. The whole 
damned business irritated him. If 
he was out of step with the times, 
to hell with the times. 

Mr. Master Salesman didn’t even 
say when he would call. You were 
expected to sit on the edge of your 
chair, waiting for the great man to 
appear. 

Finally Perry decided what he’d 
do. He’d simply not open the door 
when the MS came knocking. 

Upon that decision, he slept well. 

Sometime later he dreamed of 
frying bacon over an open fire in 
the woods, although he hadn’t been 
out to the park in three years. 

When he opened his eyes, the 
sun was up. He still smelled bacon 
frying. 

Perry crawled out of bed, fum- 
bled into his robe and followed his 
nose to the kitchen-bar. 

There, in his favorite chair, sat a 
handsomely-dressed, distinguished 
man with florid complexion, iron 
gray hair and a fashionable 
paunch. 

Strips of bacon were frying on 
the bright, spotless steel of the 
cooking shield. 

“How did you get in here?” 
Perry asked crossly. 

“Serve-All does all,” his visitor 
said cryptically and smiled the 
smile that’s known around the 
world. Perry would have no oppor- 
tunity to shut out the Master Sales- 
man. He was in. 

“You are Mr. Mansfield?” 

“Yes sir,” Perry said, uncertain 
of decorum. 



“My name is Marlboro,” the MS 
said in melodius tones. “Master 
is the proper term used in address- 
ing us. Please sit down.” 

“Yes, Master,” Perry said. He 
felt like a fool and sat down. 

“Breakfast will be served in a 
few moments,” Marlboro said. “I 
hope you don’t mind, I examined 
your excellent library before you 
came in.” He pulled a volume off 
the shelf. “This is a beautiful old 
first edition. Wherever did you find 
it?” 

It was Perry’s copy of “Basic 
Sales Techniques” with Burton 
footnotes on vacuum cleaner sales 
charts for the last half of the 20th 
century. 

“I’ve read it, of course,” Marl- 
boro continued, “but I’ve never 
owned a copy.” He caressed the 
dogeared cardboard cover. “Isn’t it 
fantastic? In that barbaric century 
the customers sometimes refused to 
buy from our predecessors in the 
Guild. It seems impossible that any- 
one could have been so crude as to 
turn away one of those sturdy pio- 
neers at the door.” 

Perry shifted uncomfortably. He 
had been prepared to turn away 
one of the Great Men at his door. 

“Ah!” Marlboro exclaimed. 
“Your bacon is ready, young man.” 
At a flick of the salesman’s finger, 
the golden strips of meat lifted into 
the air and floated to an absorbent 
mat on the table. Perry stared. Not 
a bubble of fat had fallen to the 
floor in passage. 

“How did you do that?” 
“Serve-All does all,” the MS said 
coyly. 

“Mine doesn’t,” Perry said. 



SALES RESISTANCE 



71 




“Of course not!” Marlboro 
moved deftly into the opening. 
“You need a new one.” 

So he had tumbled for the first 
trap. Perry blushed and ate a piece 
of bacon. 

The Master hefted an object to 
the table top. It was a hemisphere 
about 18 inches in diameter, 
smooth and featureless except for a 
handle on the curved top. It was 
painted psychological green. 

“This is the new Serve-All,” 
Marlboro said glibly. “Notice its 
smooth unobtrusive shape. No 
working parts exposed, but inside 
is a mass of circuits and servos 
around a baby reactor ready to do 
everything for you.” 

“The bacon,” Perry persisted. 
“How?” 

He was aware that the first step 
in successful selling is to arouse 
curiosity. But he was confident he 
could refuse to buy, though it be 
contrary to convention and good 
taste. 

“Fingers of energy,” the MS said. 
“Invisible, sensitive fingers of en- 
ergy reach out of here — ” He 
tapped the Serve-All dome. “ — and 
they’ll do anything that needs do- 
ing, at your mental command. 
Right now this one’s tuned to me, 
but a minor adjustment will fit it 
to your personal needs. Here, let 
me show you something else.” 

Perry felt a gentle, firm pressure 
on his left cheekbone. It moved 
down his cheeks, across his upper 
lip and up the other side. Then un- 
der his chin. 

Marlboro whipped out a pocket 
mirror. 

Perry had just been shaved. 

72 



“See?” the Master beamed. 
“Wonderful isn’t it?” Perry nodded. 
That was calculated to put him in 
a yes mood. 

While they talked the Serve-All 
cleared the breakfast clutter and 
cleaned the cooking shield without 
visible remains or waste. Marlboro 
pulled a contract pad out of his 
pocket. 

“I presume I can put you down 
for one of these.” 

“I don’t need it,” Perry said. 
“My old one is good enough.” 

“Ridiculous!” Marlboro said in- 
dignantly and then chuckled good- 
humoredly. “Oh, I see what you’re 
doing. You’re trying some of the 
old tricks from the 20th century. 
Well, I like a game of wits, too. 
Look what else this model will do.” 

While Perry watched, the Serve- 
All repaired a broken knob on a 
plastic chest, cleaned the rug and 
etched a mural of a voluptuous 
nude on one blank wall. 

“If you’ll excuse me,” Perry mur- 
mured, “it’s time for me to go to 
work.” 

“Of course, of course,” the Mas- 
ter laughed jovially. 

In rapid succession a comb 
dressed Perry’s hair, his robe and 
pajamas were whisked off and his 
street clothes came floating out of 
the closet on more invisible fingers 
of energy. 

Before he knew it, he was ready 
for work. 

“I really must be going, too,” 
Marlboro said, “if you’ll just sign 
here.” 

“How much is it?” 

The Master Salesman sighed. 

“You’re really very diflficult. It’s 

HENRY STILL 




$9,785, plus tax.” 

“I can’t afford it.” 

“Now, Mr. Mansfield. A joke’s a 
joke. If your credit rating wasn’t 
the finest, I wouldn’t be here. I 
know, and you know, your income 
is mortgaged for only 15 more years 
and your life expectancy is at least 
50.” 

Perry moved uneasily toward the 
bathroom. An invisible finger of 
energy opened the door for him. 

“If you don’t mind,” he said 
angrily, “this is something I’m quite 
capable of doing for myself.” He 
slammed the door. 

But the Serve-All flushed the 
toilet for him. 

When he emerged, Marlboro’s 
patience also was gone. 

“Sign,” he said firmly. 

“I don’t want it.” 

“Young man,” the Master said 
thinly. “You don’t realize what 
dangerous ground you’re on. If you 
do not cease this rudeness at once, 
I’ll report you to the council.” 

“Report and be damned! I don’t 
need your gadget and I’m not go- 
ing to buy it. Now get out!” 

Marlboro was blue with rage. He 
backed uncertainly toward the door 
and stopped. 

“This borders on sacrilege,” he 
whispered. “You’ll hear from me 
again. Soon.” 

Perry slammed that door, too, 
and walked jauntily to work. 



H e heard from the Master 
Salesman again^ — exactly two 
hours later. The message tube de- 
livered a summons ordering him 
into City Court. That afternoon. 

SALES RESISTANCE 



Perry went. He had never been 
in court before. He was frightened 
and regretful that he had been so 
abrupt with Marlboro. But he re- 
sented the invasion of his privacy 
and to bolster his courage, he built 
that anger into a fair rage by the 
time he reached the courtroom. 

Marlboro was there. A judge was 
there. And on each of two tables 
squatted a metal box with voice 
tubes. A bailiff guided him to his 
table and placed the voice tube in 
his hand. 

“You’re late Mr. Mansfield,” the 
judge snapped. “Justice must be 
swift and you’re impeding it.” He 
lifted a printed card and scanned it 
near-sightedly for a moment. 
“You’re here charged with violat- 
ing the public interest by failing to 
purchase an item which you are 
able to consume and which you can 
afford to buy.” 

“There’s no law against — ” Perry 
began indignantly. 

“Don’t tell me your troubles, 
young man,” the judge interrupted. 
“That’s what your lawyer’s for.” 
His gesture indicated the metal 
box. Perry held the voice tube 
dumbly. The bailiff leaned over his 
shoulder. 

“You tell your side of the story 
in there,” he whispered. 

Marlboro was muttering rapidly 
and at great length into his “law- 
yer,” Perry did likewise, relating all 
he could remember of the morning 
fiasco. When he finished, the ma- 
chine whirred, whistled and har- 
rumphed twice before spewing out 
several yards of perforated tape. 

The plaintiff’s counsel did the 
same, except the tape was longer. 

73 




“Now Mr. Bailiff,” the judge 
said, “you may bring in the jury.” 

Perry was no longer surprised 
when the jury was rolled in. It was 
a large gray analog computor 
mounted on wheels. The judge 
stepped down from the bench and 
fed in the two conflicting tapes. 

The jury digested the informa- 
tion noisily. 

“It’s an old model,” the judge 
apologized, but just then a white 
card popped out on a small metal 
tray. The bailiff delivered it to the 
judge. 

He studied the card. Perry’s 
heart thiunped painfully during the 
calculated period of suspense. 

“As you attempted to inform the 
court earlier, Mr. Mansfield,” the 
judge said somberly, “there is no 
law in the land which forces you to 
buy any item from our distinguished 
colleagues of distribution.” Perry’s 
heart brightened and he slid back 
from the edge of the chair. 

“However,” the judge peered 
down, “it has been held by many 
courts that when the public interest 
is to be served by the individual 
purchase of a piece of merchandise 
which that individual can consume 
and which that individual is able 
to buy without financial hardship, 
then that individual must sacrifice 
his emotional reluctance to the 
good of society.” 

The jurist paused thoughtfully. 

“I think, Mr. Mansfield, that you 
should relearn the basic tenets of 
our society and economy. First, 
Consumption is Prosperity and that 
derives from the ancient law of 
Supply and Demand. S & D means, 
in simple terms, that when there is 

74 



a supply of something, a demand 
must be created to consume it. 
That is why we have Master Sales- 
men. That is why they are the 
staunchest and most highly-re- 
spected citizens in our land. 

He bowed to Marlboro who as- 
sumed a benevolent smile. 

“This court decrees,” the judge 
said sternly, “that you are to pur- 
chase an item known as the 2087 
Serve-All from Master Salesman 
Marlboro and customary steps will 
be taken to attach your future 
salary to satisfy the stipulated pay- 
ment schedule. Court dismissed.” 

Perry was too stunned to move. 
His petty rebellion had collapsed 
into a pot of embarrassment. He 
was vaguely aware of Marlboro 
shaking his hand with a moist, 
jovial palm. 

“No hard feelings, young man,” 
the MS said. “It was really quite 
interesting. I haven’t had a case 
like this in five years.” 

The condescension stirred Perry’s 
anger again. 

“I demand an appeal!” 

The judge was leaving the bench, 
but he turned back. 

“Appeal bond is $2000.” 

“No appeal,” Perry S2iid glumly. 

He walked home. The 2087 
Serve-All was there waiting for 
him, in the middle of his living 
room floor. 

Marlboro had tied a gay red 
ribbon around it to cheer him. 

He wasn’t cheered. The thing 
must have been delivered even 
while he was in court. There had 
never been a doubt that he would 
lose the case. Rage began to crawl 

HENRY STILL 




its acid path through his stomach 
again. 

The Serve-All was tuned to him 
now. It removed his hat and coat 
and put them in the closet. It 
loosened his tie, patted a sofa 
cushion to his shape and brought 
him a drink. 

Perry might just possibly have 
adjusted to the situation, but the 
Serve-All was over anxious. 

He liked to sip a drink. But 
when he lifted the glass to his lips, 
an invisible finger of energy pushed 
helpfully on the bottom. 

Perry strangled. 

When he recovered, his rage had 
crystallized in a definite course of 
action. 

He looked at the Serve-All and 
he looked at his hands. Not enough. 
He needed something much more. 
His memory of history recalled such 
items as an axe and a sledge ham- 
mer, but such no longer existed. 

But the plastic table had legs of 
substantial heft. A low growl rose 
in his throat as he grabbed the 
table and ripped it to pieces. 

The dismayed Serve-All scuttled 
across the room to repair the dam- 
age. 

Perry fended it off with his new 
club and then smashed downward, 
again and again, delighting in the 
screech of crushed metal and the 
tinkling death of transistors, vacu- 
um tubes and servos. 

At the center was the tiny reac- 
tor box, but that was of solid lead 
and steel, that, fortunately, was 
virtually impervious for radiation 
safety. But ne didn’t care. It was 
also inert and needn’t be destroyed. 

So Perry was free; as free as an 

SALES RESISTANCE 



aging husband who has just dis- 
patched his jaded wife. He sang a 
little and danced around the shat- 
tered scraps of plastic and wire and 
metal. 

Then he heard the plaintive 
bleating beep of sound issuing from 
the central core of the Serve-All. 
He bent over it and read engraved 
lettering on the steel : “Central 
Registry No. C187-D69.” 

Good God! Any idiot would 
know that every piece of equipment 
was centrally registered and carried 
a built-in signal to summon repair 
machinery. 

And destruction of mortgaged 
property was a criminal offense. 

So what now? 

Escape? 

Escape! He must be out of the 
house when the repair machine ar- 
rived. He must run and keep run- 
ning, from the law and the Master 
Salesman and Serve-All, Inc. 

How much time did he have? 
Not more than a few minutes for 
the smooth central machinery to 
reach across the city to him; ma- 
chinery which even now was on its 
way to rescue a damaged brother. 

Perry snatched his coat from the 
closet and ran to the door. 

Food. If he would hide from the 
methodical meat grinder of society, 
he must have food to live. He raced 
to the kitchen bar. 

There was food there, but he 
didn’t know how to get at it. He 
had never before needed to do 
more than dial up portions for a 
meal, but he must have food in 
containers, food that would not 
spoil while he conserved his life on 
its dwindling supply. 



75 




He ripped open a locked panel 
on the wall. There was food. But 
the large containers were locked in 
place. He clawed at the metal, but 
only tore his flesh and dripped 
blood on the immaculate counter 
top. 

The club he had used on the 
Serve- All I He recovered the plastic 
bludgeon and went to work. 

Five minutes later he had dis- 
lodged two of the large tins. One 
said beans; the other said meat. 

Beans dripped a trail of juice 
across the floor as he ran to the 
door. 

He threw it open. 

A repair robot scuttled in and 
knocked him sprawling on the liv- 
ing room floor. 

Perry stared wildly at the me- 
chanical beast. It hummed anxious- 
ly, retrieving bits of wreckage like 
a mother bird repairing a broken 
egg* 

Mansfield belly-crawled stealthily 
back toward the door. He might 
make it yet. The robot probably 
wasn’t geared for cop duty. 



But the door was blocked. 

Perry looked up past the knees 
and the belted paunch to the face. 
It was Master Marlboro. 

Perry rose wearily to his feet and 
dropped the tins of food to the 
floor. 

“All right,” he said, “I give up.” 
“Really, Mr. Mansfield,” Marl- 
boro’s lips curled with delicate dis- 
gust. “Isn’t this a childish way to 
treat a beautiful machine?” 

“What will you do with me?” 
The MS didn’t answer. He pulled 
a contract pad out of his pocket 
and started writing. 

“You mean you’re going to sell 
me another one?” 

Marlboro shoved the pad in his 
hand. 

“I’m quite sure you’ll sign this 
one,” he said firmly. 

Perry read the sales contract: 
For standard consideration y this 
entitles one Perry Mansfield to all 
required services and exclusive use 
of private quarters in Airy Hills 
Sanatarium, 

Perry signed. • • •

The officials had been napping the 



day Donnie passed inspection . How 



else could you explain such an error 



in his emotional conditioning? 



BY JOHN JOHNSON 



D onnie clenched his 

small fists and tried not to cry, 
but two elliptical tears ran slowly 
down his cheeks. The sight of them 
made Mr. Ames even madder. 

“Look at him/’ he stormed, turn- 
ing to Martha. “Just look at him. 
Every damn time I try to reason 
with him, he starts to snivel like an 
animal, instead of acting like a nor- 



mal human being.” Mr. Ames 
flicked his cigar ashes toward a 
vacuum cup on the wall and looked 
down at the boy. “Now stop that 
stupid crying and tell me what this 
is all about.” 

Donnie sniffled a couple of times 
and wiped his nose on the back of 
one of his blue uniform sleeves. 

“Well,” Mr. Ames said, coldly. 



77 




The boy took a deep breath and 
raised his head. “I want you to 
spend some time with me/’ he said. 
‘T want you to — ” he searched the 
elusive shadows of memory until he 
found the word he wanted — “I 
want you to play with me. That’s 
it. I want you to play with me once 
in a while.” 

Mr. Ames blinked his eyes and 
stepped back. “Play,” he repeated. 
“What do you mean play?'^ 

Donnie hesitated. “You know,” 
he said, finally, “take me on long 
walks and sit down and play games 
and tell me stories once in a while.” 
“But you’ve got all the stories 
you need,” Mr. Ames said, waving 
his hand at the banks of audiotapes 
stacked neatly on the wall shelves. 
“And your audio-prompter can tell 
them better than I can.” 

“Yes,” Donnie said, ‘i)ut that’s a 
machine and I want — ” 

“What’s wrong with a machine,” 
Mr. Ames said, his face getting red. 
“Some of our best things come from 
machines. Didn’t they teach you 
that at the Incubator?” 

“Yes,” the boy said, “but isn’t 
there anything besides machines? I 
can’t play with machines, I want to 
play with you!” He began to sob 
again. 

Mr. Ames dashed his cigar to the 
floor. “I give up,” he said. “By the 
Red Balls of Jupiter, I give up!” 
“Now, Henry,” his wife said. 
“Remember, the boy’s only seven.” 
“Don’t ‘Henry’ me,” Mr. Ames 
said, “And besides, what does be- 
ing seven have to do with it. When 
I was his age, I was an honor stu- 
dent in physics. He can’t even pass 
algebra.” 

78 



Donnie stared at the toes of his 
boots. 

“I’ve given this kid everything,” 
Mr. Ames went on. “He’s going to 
the best pre-nuclear school in the 
whole hemisphere. He’s got his own 
rocket kit. Why, he’s even been on 
a study cruise to the moon! How 
many kids his age have been to the 
moon already? I bet no other kid in 
our project has been there. And 
what do I get as a reward.” Mr. 
Ames didn’t wait for an answer. 
“Trouble. That’s what I get, trou- 
ble. Why in Galaxy he can’t leave 
me alone like a normal child is 
more than I can understand.” He 
stopped for breath and lit a fresh 
cigar. 

“Maybe the boy’s sick,” Martha 
said timidly. 

Mr. Ames ignored her. “I’ve 
tried to be a good father to him,” 
he said, his voice self-righteous. 
“I’m giving him a chance to make 
something out of himself. All I ask 
is that he be of service to the world, 
and make me proud of him some 
day. But what does he do? Does he 
concentrate on his career, like the 
rest of the kids? Hell, no, he wants 
to hang around me, always under- 
foot, always asking stupid ques- 
tions. Play!” Mr. Ames snorted. 

“It’s not just play.” 

“Heh, what’s that?” Mr. Ames 
jumped. 

“I said it’s not just play,” Donnie 
repeated, bravely brushing away his 
tears. “You don’t give me any — 
he searched again for the right 
word — “any companionship. A boy 
needs companionship. Don’t you 
understand?” 

“No, I don’t,” Mr. Ames said. 

JOHN JOHNSON 





“And Tm sure they didn’t teach 
you that in the Incubator either. 
Don’t you realize you should be 
fully coordinated by now. Instead, 
you want me to take time from my 
work — Why it’s preposterous. It’s, 
it’s— unscientific !” 

“But, all I want—” 

Mr. Ames held up his hand. 
“Enough of this,” he said. “I re- 
fuse to discuss it anymore. Now go 
to your room and get ready for 
your study period.” 

The boy burst out crying again 
and ran out of the room. 

Mr. Ames shook his head. “Defi- 
nite neurotic tendencies,” he mut- 
tered to himself. 

“What dear?” his wife said. 
“Nothing, Martha,” he an- 
swered. “Just talking to myself.” He 
sat down heavily on the couch and 
sighed. What was wrong with Don- 
nie, anyway? Where did he get 
those archaic ideas from? Surely he 
had been taught that the whole 
purpose of the incubator system was 
to speed up learning and growth 
processes so children wouldn’t have 
to waste precious years growing up, 
like they did in tixe old days. Why 
their new technological age simply 
had no time to fool around with 
infantile desires. There were too 
many things to do, too many knotty 
scientific problems to solve. Emo- 
tions, Mr. Ames mumbled to him- 
self, you never could trust your 
damn emotions. 

That night, after Donnie was in 
bed, Mr. Ames went to his study 
and pulled out the boy’s file. It ex- 
plained what he was fitted for, what 
abilities he had inherited, and what 
Illustrated by Paul Orban his primary training included. Mr. 

79 




Ames noted sadly that the boy’s 
Scientific Quotient was 142, well 
above normal, and that he would 
stand six feet tall and weigh close 
to 195 pounds when fully devel- 
oped. 

Mr. Ames, who was incubator- 
bom himself, was completely sold 
on the ingenious system the Fed- 
eration of World Councils had de- 
vised. No more hit-and-miss mass 
reproduction, where morons were 
gradually out-breeding intelligent 
beings, but instead, selective arti- 
ficial insemination through which 
only the best strains were permitted 
to reproduce. Each generation, the 
human race got healthier and 
smarter. Insanity and inherited dis- 
eases were a thing of the past and 
nature’s primitive law — only the 
fittest shall survive — was now a glit- 
tering reality. Why the Federated 
Incubators even took over the bur- 
den of educating the children for 
the first five years. Parents no 
longer had to be bothered caring 
for helpless, bawling brats. By the 
time Incubates were placed on the 
available list, they were completely 
self-sufficient and emotionally con- 
ditioned to fit into any family group. 
Parents simply picked what they 
wanted. Mr. Ames, of course, had 
selected a future nuclear-chemist 

It was a beautiful system, Mr. 
Ames told himself, and even more 
important, it worked. But somehow, 
some way, there was something 
radically wrong with their child. 

“Definite neurotic symptoms,” 
Mr. Ames murmured, half aloud. 
By Jupiter, there was only one thing 
to do. He shut the folder firmly 
and spun around to the trans-audio. 

80 



A green light appeared on the panel 
almost immediately. 

“Your connection, please?” the 
automon said. 

“Give me the local Incubator.” 

There was a pause, then a click. 
“Federated Health and Service, co- 
ordinator speaking. May I help 
you?” 

“Yes. This is Mr. Henry Ames, 
over at the Amarillo Group Project. 
I have a complaint to make.” 

“Yes?” The coordinator, a wom- 
an, was carefully polite. 

“It’s about the child you sent 
us.” 

“Specimen please?” 

“What? Oh, it’s a boy. Class 
Triple A, breed, nuclear chemistry. 
We got him about 18 months ago 
and- — ” 

“What is your number please?” 

“It’s . just a minute.” Mr. 
Ames consulted the folder. “My 
number is 34-72-oh-41. And we’ve 
got a three-year guarantee,” he 
added pointedly. 

“Yes, sir. Just a minute sir.” 
There was a whirring sound at the 
other end of the circuit. After a 
short wait, the coordinator’s voice 
came through again. 

“Well, sir,” she said. “You have 
the select model in our scientific 
line of seven-year-olds. According 
to our records, he checked out per- 
fectly on all phases of learning and 
aptitude. Have you tried memory 
teaching?” 

“Yes, I’ve tried memory teach- 
ing. He learns fine.” Mr. Ames 
stopped. “Look, you don’t seem to 
understand. He’s okay as far as per- 
formance goes. He does everything 
we tell him and all that, but he’s 

JOHN JOHNSON 




still a real pain in the — I mean, he’s 
developing very annoying charac- 
teristics.” 

“Please go on, Mr. Ames.” The 
coordinator’s voice was warm and 
sympathetic. “How does he annoy 
you?” 

“Well, for one thing, he’s getting 
pronounced possessive tendencies. 
He almost seems to resent being left 
alone. Why, just this evening he 
told me he wants us to play with 
him!” 

“Did you say play with him?” 

“That’s right,” Mr. Ames said, 
triumphantly. “And he says he 
needs companionship, or something 
like that.” 

“Companionship,” the coordina- 
tor repeated. “Oh, dear. This is 
more serious than I thought. I’m 
afraid you definitely have a reject, 
Mr. Ames. If he shows these ten- 
dencies at this early age, then the 
situation will be intolerable later 
on. 

“It’s intolerable right now,” 
Henry insisted. “Anyway, I thought 
you people were supposed to clear 
up all this emotional unbalance in 
the primary psych indoctrination.” 

“We usually do,” the coordinator 
agreed, “but every once in a while, 
one slips through inspection with 
faulty communal-perception. The 
one you’ve got is obviously a throw- 
back.” The coordinator coughed 
apologetically. “It’s really not the 
boy’s fault, of course, but I’m afraid 



we’ll have to reclaim him.” 

“The sooner the better,” Mr. 
Ames said. “This mess is upsetting 
my work at the lab. When can I get 
a replacement?” 

“We’ll send a new model over 
when we pick up the reject. Will 
tomorrow morning be convenient?” 
“Sure. Fine. Just make sure this 
one is normal. You better check our 
physio records too. I hear the peo- 
ple down the circle got one that 
didn’t look like them at all.” 

“Don’t worry,” the coordinator 
assured him. “You’ll get a boy you 
can be proud of this time. Will 
there be anything more now?” 

“No, no, I guess not.” An uneasy 
feeling slipped into Mr. Ames’s 
consciousness. “I just wondered,” 
he said, suddenly. “What will hap- 
pen to Don — I mean, the reject 
you sent us. Will he be — uh-nie- 
stroyed?” 

The coordinator laughed. “Heav- 
ens, no, Mr, Ames,” she said, 
lightly. “He’ll be sent to the Biolog- 
ical Reservation and allowed to live 
out his life span with other rejects. 
He’ll be much happier there. We’re 
not savages, you know.” 

“That’s right,” Mr. Ames said, 
his tone matching her brightness. 
“We’re not savages. Well, we’ll be 
expecting the new one tomorrow, 
and thanks for all your trouble.” 
“No trouble at all,” the coordi- 
nator said, smoothly. “Feel free to 
call on us any time.” • • •

The Pied Piper who had promised them Paradise

But this time it was the Piper who had to pay . 



BY JOSEPH SHALLIT 



R uth was standing at the vast 
window of the spacejX)rt, her 
body taut and eager^ the luggage 
piled high around her. When 
Harvey Flanders came out of the 
ship carrying the last two suitcases, 
she darted to him. 

“Harvey, it’s a dream — it’s 
heavenly!” she cried, catching hold 
of his arm. “Did you imagine — did 
you possibly ever imagine it would 
be like this?” 



Harvey’s eyes followed the sweep 
of his wife’s hand, out at the dazz- 
ling expanse of fields and orchards, 
green and gold under this magni- 
ficent sun. The fantastic vegetation 
stretched in lush undulations to a 
distant purple horizon, the sweep 
broken only by the brown streaks 
of roads, the winding ribbons of 
sapphire-tinted water, and, here 
and there, the pastel pink and blue 
roofs of the settlers’ houses.

Exultation filled his chest. He 
fought it down, deliberately, grim- 
ly. ‘There were places on Earth 
that were like this before the blight 
came. California . Florida . 
looked like this/’ 

“Like this?” Ruth exclaimed. 
“Harvey! Look at those giant fruit 
trees. Look at them.” 

Harvey caught her shoulder in a 
tight grip. “Honey, we just can’t 
let ourselves go overboard till we’re 
sure everything’s okay,” he said 
quietly. “We’ve had our hopes built 
up and slapped down so many 
times.” He looked down into her 
brown eyes. “Kitten, do you re- 
member the time old man Reeber 
came climbing over the fence, yell- 
ing that the blight was going, it 
was moving off his cornfield, and 
we believed, we actually believed 
some miracle had happened, and 
we went chasing after him and 
found it was just a sunbeam break- 
ing through a cloud bank. What a 
mirage that was!” 

“Harvey,” Ruth said softly, “do 
you really think that this” — her 
hand traced the horizon — “is a 
mirage?” 

“I want to get a closer look, 
honey — I want to feel it and taste 
it before I believe it,” he said. But 
when he glanced again at the land- 
scape, his breath quickened and a 
tingle rode over his skin. “No, 
honey,” he said quickly, T don’t 
think it’s a mirage. I think it’s what 
we’ve been dreaming about a long, 
long time.” 

Ruth gave a relieved cry and 
flung her arms around him. He 
held her, patting her gently. “Now 
take it easy,” he said. 

84 



She looked up abruptly, her eyes 
wet. “The first thing, you’ve got to 
get some color back,” she said 
fiercely. “You’ve gotten so awfully 
pale!” 

“And you’re lovelier than ever,” 
he said, running a hand along her 
cheek. “Now let’s get moving be- 
fore they put us back on the ship 
and send us home for being slow- 
pokes.” 

She pounced down on a big, 
leather-thonged trunk. He pushed 
her aside. “Half pint, you t^e the 
little ones.” 

Together they loaded their bag- 
gage on the red four-wheeled cart. 
Most of the other immigrants had 
already loaded their luggage and 
now stood beside the carts, each 
couple a little island of chatter and 
excitement. Next to Harvey and 
Ruth were Dr. Norbert Lurie and 
his wife Edna, both spectacled, 
scholarly, and too thin; both earn- 
est, conscientious, and eager to 
help; rather boring company on a 
ten-month space voyage, but very 
comforting to have as neighbors in 
a strange land. After them came 
the Schweitzer twins, husky, blond, 
pink-faced youths, each with his 
little china-doll wife. Beyond them 
stood big, redheaded Jim Brace 
and his slim brunette wife, Nancy. 
Brace was heaving the last of his 
trunks onto his cart, his biceps 
bulging awesomely. 

“Real pioneer stock, this Red 
Brace,” Harvey said. “Shame there 
are no Indians around — he’d have 
been a good man to have around in 
a scrap.” 

Ruth’s eyes crinkled in puzzled 
thought. “Harvey, weren’t there 

JOSEPH SHALLIT 




any people here at all?” 

“Nope. Not a soul. Not till the 
good gray colonel stepped out of his 
ship onto one of these golden hills, 
about fifteen years ago.” 

“It seems incredible,” Ruth whis- 
pered. 

“Hey, fellows,” came the boom- 
ing voice of big Red Brace, but it 
was promptly lost in the roar of a 
loudspeaker: 

“Attention! Everyone will please 
assemble in the main reception 
room. Follow the red arrows down 
the ramp to the green doors. Please 
fill up all the front seats. Colonel 
Baker will address you. Leave your 
baggage where it is. Everybody now 
— ^follow the red arrows.” 

Excited, high-hearted talk 
frothed up from the immigrants as 
they moved down the ramp. After 
being confined for ten months in 
the narrow, dreadfully sound- 
proofed rooms and corridors of the 
spaceship, every sound, every bit of 
motion was an intense delight. 

Green doors opened on a long, 
low-ceilinged room with paneled 
wooden walls painted in mottled 
green and gold. Large windows 
threw shafts of light across the rows 
of rough-hewn benches. The bab- 
ble of voices swelled around them, 
grew louder and more excited as 
the minutes passed. Then abruptly 
the voices in the front of the audi- 
torium quieted, and silence flooded 
backward. Heads began to turn to 
the right side of the stage where 
something seemed to be happening 
in the wing — and then, at last. 
Colonel Martin E. Baker came into 
sight and walked slowly to the cen- 

WRONG ANALOGY 



ter of the stage. 

He stood there smiling, a middle- 
sized man in a light brown suit, 
with a friendly bulge in the abdo- 
men, and small, neat feet. His 
cheeks were round and sunburned; 
his hair was brilliantly white, 
though thinning at the temples and 
the back of his skull. He held a 
lemon-colored cane in front of him 
and leaned on it slighdy. 

“Well,” he said, a concealed 
microphone carrying his voice 
through the auditorium, “what do 
you think?” 

The immigrants seated before 
him answered with delighted laugh- 
ter which merged into a wave of 
handclapping. When the noise 
died down. Colonel Baker said, in 
a low voice, “That’s all I want to 
hear.” 

He nodded, looking thoughtful. 
“This is the moment I always wait 
for — the moment when the settlers 
get off the ship and verify for them- 
selves all the things I told them. 
You see, my friends, when I go on 
my lecture tours around the Earth, 
the scepticism I run into makes me 
feel like a very lonely man. I tell 
my story — about a place where 
things grow five to seven times as 
big as anything Earth ever saw in 
her best days, a place where one 
gets three or four harvests in what 
would be a single growing season 
on Earth — I tell the story and find 
that quite a lot of people don’t be- 
lieve it. But fortunately, here and 
there I meet people who can re- 
spond to a vision — people brave 
enough to rip up their stakes and 
take a journey across the oceans of 
space. And what I wait for is to see 

85 




their faces and hear their voices 
when they reach these shores and 
learn that everything is true — 
everything — ^just as I told it.” 

There was another burst of hand- 
clapping. Red Brace put two fin- 
gers to his lips and produced a 
deafening whistle, prolonging it un- 
til his wife yanked his hand away 
from his mouth. 

“You can imagine,” Colonel 
Baker went on in his mellow, vi- 
brant voice — “you can imagine, my 
friends, what my feelings were 
when I stepped out of the space- 
ship Explorer and set foot on this 
incredible planet for the first time.” 
His eyes fixed themselves on a dis- 
tant point above the heads of his 
audience. “Here, I said to myself 
— ^here is Paradise. The blight on 
Earth was already becoming acute 
— and here suddenly I was in a 
land richer than anything man has 
ever seen since he left the Garden 
of Eden. I still remember the thrill 
I felt when I squeezed this magic 
loam between my fingers. I could 
scarcely wait out the return trip to 
Earth so I could bring back here 
the seeds and cuttings of our edible 
plants. What happened after that 
is history. Peaches, pears, apples, 
all producing abundantly in their 
first season. Oranges the size of 
melons. Vegetables big enough for 
giants ... Of course, it wasn’t eco- 
nomically feasible to send this 
produce to Earth — although one of 
these days I think it will be. As 
the blight gets worse people will 
get so sick of subsisting on dehy- 
drated plankton they will be willing 
to pay the enormous transporta- 
tion costs to get our fruits and 

86 



vegetables. But meanwhile, by the 
greatest good fortune, an economic 
base for our agriculture did develop 
with the discovery of radioactive 
minerals on our neighboring planet. 
It’s a perfect arrangement: we feed 
the miners, and they pay us with 
the earnings from their mines. Two 
planets, floating side by side in 
space, each supplying what the 
other needs — ^it seems too perfect 
to be a mere coincidence. You feel 
there must be some providence, 
some mysterious intellect that 
planned it this way.” He paused. 
A smile softened his face. “I guess 
I’ve talked long enough. I’m de- 
lighted to see you all here, safe and 
happy. You are the twenty-third 
group to arrive since we opened 
this planet. Soon the ship will leave 
for the long voyage to Earth to 
pick up the twenty-fourth con- 
tingent, most of whom are already 
signed up. My associate, Mr. Cars- 
ing, will take over now and fill you 
in on some of the things you’ll want 
to know. Meanwhile, I want to 
say: Welcome to Paradise. If you 
ever have any problems of any 
kind, let me hear from you. Good 
luck!” 

Applause rolled after him as he 
walked slowly off stage. Almost im- 
mediately, a tall, thin man in a gray 
suit walked to the center of the 
stage. He carried a sheaf of papers. 
His movements were quick and 
nervous. His scalp was naked ex- 
cept for ragged patches of hair 
above his ears. His skin shone sal- 
lowly in the light from the win- 
dows. “I will now read the assign- 
ment of subdivisions,” he said. 
“Please listen carefully and make a 

JOSEPH SHALLIT 




note of your location.” His voice 
had a harsh edge of shrillness. 

Ruth looked at Harvey and 
wrinkled her nose. “I don’t like 
him as much as Colonel Baker,” 
she said. 

Carsing read off the names, des- 
ignating a number and letter for 
each. Harvey and Ruth Flanders 
were assigned to area 189D. The 
numbers for the Luries and the 
Schweitzers followed closely, but 
the Braces weren’t reached until 
the 200’s. “Hey,” growled Red 
Brace, “don’t take me away from 
my buddies.” 

“All marketing of crops will be 
handled by our central office,” 
Carsing said. “All your shipments 
will be listed in a credit account, 
against which all your charges will 
be debited. For bookkeeping con- 
venience, settlement will be made 
once a year.” His papers moved 
restlessly in his hands. “The guides 
are waiting to take you to your 
homesteads. You will now return to 
your luggage and finish loading it 
on the carts. After that, you are to 
go to the main door, where you will 
receive your oxygen packs, and 
then you are to assemble outside. 
Are there any questions?” 

“Yeh!” called out Red Brace, 
jumping to his feet. “I don’t like 
the location you gave me. How do 
I get it changed?” 

Carsing scowled. “How do you 
know you don’t like it before you 
have even seen it?” 

“I know. It’s not near my 
friends.” 

“Write an application for a 
change. If there are no further 
questions — 

WRONG ANALOGY 



“Question!” Harvey was on his 
feet. “What’s this you said about 
oxygen packs?” 

“I said they’d be issued at the 
main door. Anything else?” 

“Why — why do we need oxygen 
packs?” 

“To breathe,” Carsing said sour- 
ly. “I should think that would be 
obvious.” 

“You mean . .” Harvey’s heart 
pounded. “You mean there’s no 
oxygen out there?” 

“The oxygen content of our at- 
mosphere is seven percent,” Cars- 
ing said, his voice falling to a weary 
monotone. “Seven percent is equiv- 
alent to the oxygen content you 
find when you travel 27,000 feet 
above Earth. You know you can’t 
exist at 27,000 feet unless you have 
an artificial supply of oxygen. Very 
well. The same condition applies 
here — on the ground. You will 
wear your oxygen packs at all 
times. The only exception is this 
building. We have oxygen pumped 
into it.” 

“What’s this all about?” shouted 
Red Brace. “Are you kidding us 
or something?” 

Carsing’s mouth formed a 
crumpled smile. “If you think I’m 
joking you can take a walk outside 
and see.” He turned his eyes away 
from Brace. “The packs are small 
and light. The outlet cup covers 
only the nose. There is no inter- 
ference with speech. You can thank 
Colonel Baker for sponsoring the 
research that produced these light- 
weight packs.” 

“Thank him for what?” said 
Harvey hoarsely. “Why didn’t he 
tell us before he signed us up?” 

87 




A clamor of supporting voices 
rose around him. Other immigrants 
leaped to their feet, trying to make 
themselves heard. Red Brace was 
bellowing something unintelligible. 
His wife added her indignant con- 
tralto. Carsing shouted, “Quiet!” 
and then gave up and stood there, 
scowling. 

O UT IN THE wing, on a small 
straight-backed chair, sat 
Colonel Martin E. Baker, his eyes 
half closed, his hands folded 
against his belly, as he listened to 
the angry tumult. This always hap- 
pened. It was an unpleasantness he 
could count on with the arrival of 
every new group of homesteaders. 
In an instant everybody had for- 
gotten that he had rescued them 
from a miserable existence on a 
blighted Earth. There was no 
thought of gratitude to him for 
finding this fabulous place and de- 
veloping it and bringing them here. 
No — the only thing in their grubby 
minds was the thought of the 
oxygen pack they would have to 
wear, to save themselves from 
quick death. Of course, they gave 
no thought to the money and effort 
he had expended to develop this 
pack, this neat little lightweight 
marvel. By the time he had this 
perfected and had worked out all 
the other details involved in colo- 
nizing this place, he had spent a 
fortune, he was practically broke. 
Sometimes he found it hard to 
maintain a feeling of calm and 
good will. If he wanted to let him- 
self go, it would be so easy to be- 
come a bitter, misanthropic old 

88 



man. But there would be no sense 
in that. These people were young 
and thoughtless, the victims of their 
own impulsiveness, and what the 
situation called for was patience, 
understanding, and forgiveness. 

Martin Baker let out a long sigh 
and heaved his round body out of 
his chair. He walked slowly toward 
the confused jumble of voices. He 
knew, even without distinguishing 
the sounds, that they were demand- 
ing that he appear. Baker ran a 
hand over his clothes to make sure 
they were in order, put on a broad 
and gentle smile, and stepped out 
on the stage. 

He waited until the clamor 
quieted, and then he said, “Fm 
here to answer any questions.” 

Half a dozen of the homestead- 
ers tried to talk at once. Baker 
smiled understandingly and held 
up his hand. “One at a time, please 
— every one will have his chance.” 

“What kind of a deal is this?” a 
voice bellowed from the rear. Baker 
recognized the big red-headed man, 
Brace. A bold, adventuresome man, 
handsome and powerfully built, 
but, alas, so very stupid. He would 
make a lot of noise. Baker knew, 
but actually he wouldn’t be any 
real trouble. 

“And what, may I ask, is the 
cause of your dissatisfaction?” 
Baker inquired. 

“How come we travel all the way 
out here and find out we’ve got to 
wear oxygen masks?” 

Baker shook his head, smiling 
gently. “Not really masks, my 
friend. They cover only the end of 
your nose. They’re marvelously 
comfortable, as you’ll soon see. In 

JOSEPH SHALLIT 




a few days you won’t even be aware 
you’re wearing them.” 

“Like heU,” Brace growled. “77/ 
know I’m wearing it.” 

Baker shrugged affably, and then 
gestured invitingly to the long, thin, 
somber looking man who stood with 
his hand up, not far from Brace. 
This was Lurie, the biology pro- 
fessor, a nice, harmless Ph.D. 

“What’s wrong with the atmos- 
phere?” Lurie said. “Why is an 
artificial supply of oxygen neces- 
sary?” 

“The answer is very simple,” 
Baker said. “This is a young planet, 
as planets go. The conditions here 
are just about what they were on 
Ear A eons ago. The carbon dioxide 
exhaled from the interior of the 
planet and saturating the atmos- 
phere is gradually being converted 
by the plant life — broken down, I 
should say, releasing free oxygen. 
At the present time, our oxygen 
content is about seven percent. 
Eventually, the oxygen will prob- 
ably reach the level you find on the 
surface of the Earth — about twen- 
ty-one percent. But that should take 
a long time; I’m afraid none of us 
will be around when that point is 
reached. Meanwhile, our plants 
luxuriate in an atmosphere rich in 
carbon dioxide. Plants, as you 
know, use carbon dioxide for their 
most essential life process — ^photo- 
synthesis. But I’m sure Professor 
Lurie can tell you much more about 
that than I can.” 

Lurie blinked embarrassedly, and 
looked aside at his wife, and smiled 
shyly. 

“Mr. Baker!” another voice 
broke in. 



This speaker, Baker recognized, 
was Harvey Flanders, definitely a 
dangerous type. He was a brooder; 
he had a slow, relentless fire in his 
eyes. Baker had been doubtful 
about him from the start; he’d had 
half a mind to reject his applica- 
tion. But as things happened, the 
passenger list was one couple short 
and so, at the last moment, he had 
taken Flanders and his wife. Was 
he going to have reason to regret 
what he’d done? 

“How do you propose to make 
up for this fraud you’ve put over 
on us?” Flanders was saying. 

“I’m sorry,” Baker said. “Did 
you say fraud?” 

“Fraud,” Harvey repeated bitter- 

“That’s a harsh word, my friend. 
What are you referring to?” 

“Dammit, those glowing talks 
you gave us — ” 

“And isn’t everything I told you 
true? Go out, I beg of you, and 
point out to me a single instance 
where I’ve exaggerated.” 

“But the oxygen — ” 

“I made no statement about 
oxygen,” Baker said firmly. “I’m 
sure everyone here will corroborate 
that. Did I make any false claims 
about the atmosphere? Did I, now? 
No, my friend, if you will think 
back you will find that I said noth- 
ing a^ut the atmosphere.” 

“But that’s what I mean,” 
Harvey said, his voice rising in ex- 
asperation. 

“My good friend,” Baker said 
gently, “if you were describing a 
beautiful woman, would you bother 
to mention that she had a mole on 
the sole of her foot?”

“But this is something basic.” 

“What seems basic to one person 
may seem merely incidental to an- 
other, Every man to his own opin- 
ion — and I assure you, my friend, 
you have a perfect right to yours. If 
you feel you were misled, then I am 
deeply and humbly sorry. If you 
don’t like it here, if you think you 
can find something better — ” 

“You goddamned phony, you 
know once you’ve got us here, we’re 
at your mercy!” 

Baker smiled forgivingly. “Mercy. 
There, my friend, is a word I much 
prefer to that other one you used a 
while ago. Mercy, charity, forbear- 
ance . My friends, we are all 
here together — let us try to live in 
true fellowship and to make the 
most of what has been given us. I 
can think of nothing^ more tragic 
than to start this great adventure 
on a note of strife and suspicion. I 
hope rather that we all go for- 
ward with hearts full of trust — trust 
in the future, and trust in each 
other.” His voice rose — ^his eyes 
again fixed themselves on a point 
above the heads of his audience. 
“If we work together, if we keep 
our eyes on the distant horizon, and 
ignore the advocates of spite, the 
petty minds that spin their miser- 
able webs in the dark, I am sure we 
can all look forward to a bright and 
glowing future. We stand, my 
friends, on the threshold of a brave 
new world. Let us all go forward 
with hope and faith. Under such 
banners, I know we cannot fail.” 

Slowly, Martin Baker walked off 
the stage. Harvey looked around 
helplessly at the faces of his fellow- 
voyagers who were staring at the 

90 



stage in half-dazed fascination. 
“Look, we’re not going to let him 
get away with this,” he pleaded. 
“This is exactly the way he talked 
us into signing up.” 

Harvey got some irritated looks 
in return. “Hell, we’re here, ain’t 
we?” somebody growled. 

“Harvey,” Dr. Lurie said, “I’d 
suggest we avoid conclusions until 
we’ve given this a fair trial.” 

A murmured chorus of approval 
rose around him. At that moment, 
Carsing reappeared on the stage. 
“All right, everybody,” he said 
briskly, “go back and finish loading 
up, and pick up your oxygen packs. 
Everybody’s eager to see their 
homesteads, so let’s not anybody 
hold us up. Let’s go.” With a surge 
of relief, the homesteaders flowed 
down the aisles to the exits. 



T he oxygen packs turned 
out to be, in fact, wonderfully 
comfortable. A small outlet cup 
fitted over the nose with no more 
pressure than a pair of spectacles. 
Two narrow tubes curved over the 
shoulders and ended in a small 
pack weighing about two pounds, 
most of that being the weight of a 
replaceable metal capsule. There 
was no interference with speech. 
“You see,” Ruth laughed tremu- 
lously — “you see, it actually im- 
proves your appearance.” She 
grimaced at Harvey. “All right, 
sourpuss, you can smile, can’t you?” 
The air outside was soft and 
golden, laced with a cool, gentle 
wind. The excited voices of the 
homesteaders rang with startling 
clarity. They looked with delight 

JOSEPH SHALLIT 




at each other, and called out at 
each other, and laughed, not know- 
ing exactly why. 

“Don’t seem anything wrong 
with this air,” said Red Brace. 
“Feels like any other air. I wonder 
if the old bird was kidding us.” 

One of the Schweitzer twins gave 
a laugh. “There’s one way to find 
out,” he said, and yanked the outlet 
cup off his nose. He inhaled deeply, 
smiling. “Look, Ma, I’m breath- 
ing,” he laughed. He took deep, 
gulping breaths. He did a somer- 
sault. He pounded his chest. “It’s 
all a matter of lungs,” he said. “If 
you don’t have lungs, well, you just 
can’t manage it, that’s all . .” 

He chattered on — and then, 
abruptly, his eyes took on a startled 
look. He began to breathe more 
rapidly. His breathing became la- 
bored. He fumbled for the outlet 
cup. He raised it to his nose — ^it 
slipped out of his now frantic 
hands — 

Harvey and Dr. Lurie grabbed 
him as he wavered, and fitted the 
outlet cup back over his nose. The 
youth stood there with trembling 
knees. “Sit down, kid,” Harvey 
said. “Relax — you’ll be all right.” 

The settlers stood in a stricken 
silence. They had been fully in- 
formed of the situation, they knew 
precisely what would happen, yet 
seeing it demonstrated this way was 
an appalling thing. They could see 
now, graphically, the precarious 
condition of their existence. 

There was no more shouting. 
There was little they had to say to 
each other now. 

Carsing came out of the building. 
He was instantly recognizable, de- 

WRONG ANALOGY 



spite the cup over his nose. With 
his nervous, jerky steps, he walked 
to a low platform and held up his 
hand. With him were two men, 
both gray-haired and darkly 
tanned. 

“These are your guides,” Carsing 
announced. “Go get your carts and 
move out.” 

“Hey!” shouted Red Brace. 
“What pulls these carts?” 

“You do,” Carsing said coldly. 

‘Tfou mean there aren’t any 
horses — or trucks?” 

Carsing’s mouth twisted. “No — 
no horses or trucks. Or tractors or 
washing machines. You’d better 
make up your minds to that right 
now. Transporting any large me- 
chanical equipment all the way out 
here would be impossibly expensive. 
Outside of the few small devices 
we absolutely had to have, we’ve 
imported nothing. So please don’t 
come complaining to me. From 
now on, you’ll have to learn to im- 
provise with native materials. All 
right” — he gestured to the two men 
who stood drooping behind him, as 
if leaning on invisible poles — “get 
them out and get going.” 

Carsing left the platform and 
went back into the building. For a 
moment, there was no motion 
among the settlers. Then several 
started maneuvering the heavily 
loaded carts, the men embarrassed- 
ly accepting the assistance of their 
wives. 

The two guides waited, still lean- 
ing on their phantom supports, 
talking softly, hardly looking at the 
settlers. When all the carts were 
lined up in a straggling column, the 
two guides ambled to the road that 

91 




led away from the spaceport. They 
paused and looked back briefly with 
worn eyes. Then with a motion that 
was more a shrug than a gesture, 
they started up the brown dirt road. 

Harvey looked at Ruth. Her face 
was taut. All around him the set- 
tlers were silent, except for labored 
breathing or a hurried warning as 
the wagon wheels reached a rut or 
a rock. Reality had flooded over 
them with abrupt and dismaying 
force. The sky was still bright, the 
fields were still gloriously golden 
but the radiance seemed to have 
gone out of their paradise. 

Harvey put an arm around 
Ruth’s slim shoulders. Strangely, 
as spirits sank around him, his rose. 
Now his vague forebodings had be- 
come clarified; now he knew what 
the reality was, he knew what he 
had to cope with. 

‘‘They get a ship here from 
Earth every two years,” he said to 
her. “We’ll work hard and save 
our money, and if we find we can’t 
stand it, we’ll just pack up and go 
home.” 

She looked at him miserably. 
“How awful. After all our 
hopes . .” 

“Maybe it’ll work out,” he said 
lightly. “I hate to think of living in 
a place run by these guys, but I’m 
willing to give it an honest try. 
Keep your chin up, kitten.” 

The road became steeper, and 
the settlers slipped and grunted 
and struggled behind the carts. 
Near the crest, in a field to the 
right of the road, four people were 
working, apparently cutting and 
binding grain. As the column of set- 

92 



tiers approached, the workers 
glanced up, said something to each 
other, and bent to their work again. 

“Look at that,” growled Red 
Brace. “We come across practically 
half the universe to reach this 
place, and all we get is a cockeyed 
glance out of the corner of their 
eyes.” 

“Well, you aren’t exactly a pretty 
sight,” Harvey said. 

But it was strange, he thought — 
this indifference, this lack of curi- 
osity. Here, for the first time in two 
years, were newcomers from distant 
Earth. Didn’t they want to hear the 
news, hear about the blight, ask 
questions about relatives and 
friends? Could anybody be that un- 
interested? 

At the crest of the rise, the guides 
paused, and the settlers leaned 
against their carts or sat on the 
ground to rest. In the valley below 
were little clumps of houses, long, 
low buildings, arranged in groups 
of three and four, with a hundred 
yards or so between each group. 
Off to the right, a hill, steep and 
lofty, stood alone in the rolling 
plain. Almost at the summit, in a 
cleft in the rock, was a building 
shaped like a semicircle, topped 
with a slim spire. Its walls seemed 
mostly windows. They glinted gold- 
en in the warm light. 

“And who lives up there, I won- 
der,” said Red Brace. 

“I could make a guess,” Harvey 
said. 

“Mr. Big. A nice, cozy spot where 
he can sit all day and spit down 
everybody else’s throat.” 

“I’m sure,” Harvey said, “the 
gentleman never does anything as 

JOSEPH SHALLIT 




inelegant as that.” 

The clusters of buildings had 
looked close. It took fully an hour 
before the settlers reached them. By 
that time, they were hot and thirsty 
and dispirited. As they went up the 
village street, the guides pointed 
out the numbered houses, and the 
settlers assigned to them left the 
column and carried their luggage 
inside. Most of them were inside 
only a few minutes before they 
came to the doorways to stare un- 
happily at each other. They had 
found that the houses, made of 
wood and plaster, each consisted of 
three boxy rooms containing a few 
sticks of crudely made furniture. 
Nothing was painted. There was no 
glass in the windows. The beds con- 
sisted of four posts with mattresses 
of woven vines. 

“What did you expect — inner- 
springs?” Harvey said. “Remember 
— Colonel Baker never said you’d 
get innersprings on this planet. The 
man never told you a lie.” 

The toilets were tiny out-houses, 
a hundred yards away in the field. 
“Oh, dear,” Ruth said. 

“Well, you can’t expect the man 
to transport sewer pipe to Para- 
dise,” Harvey said grimly. 

He stood in the doorway and 
waited until the guides had de- 
posited the last of the settlers and 
were started on their return trip. 
Harvey called to them as they came 
by. They glanced at him blankly, 
said something to each other, and 
kept on walking. Harvey leaped to 
the street, raced after them, 
grabbed them by the shoulders and 
spun them both around. “When I 
talk to somebody, I expect an an- 

WRONG ANALOGY 



swer,” he said savagely. 

The two guides looked at him 
with worn, emotionless eyes. They 
stood there, shoulders drooping 
slightly in a weirdly identical pos- 
ture. 

“What’s this all about?” Harvey 
said, subduing his voice with dif- 
ficulty. He waited. Nothing came 
out of them. “Do you work for 
Baker? Don’t you have farms like 
the rest of us?” 

The stocky one’s mouth twisted 
slightly. Then he spoke. “We have 
farms,” he said in a low, sullen 
voice. “We are also guides. We 
couldn’t work our farms all the 
way. We had to do extra work to 
meet our payments.” 

Harvey stared at them. “Pay- 
ments for what? Didn’t you pay for 
the farms before you came here?” 
“Payments for the oxygen,” said 
the stocky man. 

“‘What do you mean?” 

A weak, sardonic smile edged 
across their faces. “They weren’t 
told,” the tall man said. 

Harvey boiled over. He grabbed 
one man by the throat. “Told what, 
goddamn you? Talk!” 

The pale eyes stared into his. 
The sardonic smile stayed on the 
man’s lips. “Told that you’ll have 
to work all day, every day, dawn to 
dark” — his voice hardened vicious- 
ly — “to pay for the oxygen you 
breathe.” His smile widened as he 
saw the alarm in Harvey’s face. 
Harvey loosened his grip, but the 
man kept his face close to his. “You 
see that tube of oxygen on your 
back? That will last you one day. 
When you get a new one, you will 
owe a hundred credits. Do you un- 

93 




derstand now? You’ll never be able 
to stop working, because you can’t 
get ahead of that hundred credits 
a day, you just about make it if you 
work all day — and you have to 
make it, do you understand, you 
fool? — you have to, if you want 
your oxygen tomorrow, if you want 
to breathe.” 

Harvey watched dazedly as the 
two guides turned and started away 
down the road, and then, abruptly, 
the stocky one looked back and 
yelled back, “You’re slaves! All of 
you! You’re the same as us! You’re 
slaves!” 

Ruth, wide-eyed, was waiting at 
the doorway for liim, when he came 
back. “You heard them?” Harvey 
said shakily. 

“I heard,” Ruth said in a quiet 
voice. 

“Lord, what did I get you into?” 

She put a hand on his arm. 
“There’s nothing to grieve about. If 
we find that things just don’t work 
out, we’ll stick it out for two years 
and save up enough for our return 
passage.” 

Harvey looked at her brokenly. 
“If what they say is true, how can 
you save anything?” 

O F COURSE, Harvey reflected 
afterward, the guide could have 
been talking nonsense, he could 
have been some sort of nut. So 
Harvey said nothing about his en- 
counter to the other settlers. But 
after three days, everybody knew 
the true conditions of their exist- 
ence. The story was made explicit 
by the little debit-and-credit book 
that each settler was given. Every 

94 



evening a caravan of Baker’s men, 
pulling carts, came down the road, 
collected what the settlers had har- 
vested during the day, and marked 
the credits in their books. Those 
who worked from dawn to dusk 
usually managed to achieve 100 
credits. A few went over 100 — 
three, four, or five credits over — 
and were told that if they kept this 
rate up, why, in six months or so, 
they’d have enough credits to buy 
some clothes at the central com- 
missary. Several settlers fell short 
each day. They got particular at- 
tention from the man who collected 
the depleted oxygen tanks from the 
settlers and handed each a new one. 

“We’re not cutting anybody’s 
oxygen off — not right away,” he 
said. “But if I were you. I’d get 
working — fast. The Colonel looks 
these accounts over every night. He 
doesn’t like anybody getting far in 
arrears.” 

Dr. Lurie, .who, with his wife, 
had averaged only 96 credits on 
each of the first three days, spoke up 
puzzledly. “Do you mean — do you 
mean you actually let people — 
asphyxiate?” 

The leader gave a nasty grin. “I 
didn’t say that — I just said we 
don’t give them any more oxygen. 
What they do after that is their 
business.” 

“Is that right?” growled Red 
Brace. He moved slowly through to 
the front of the crowd and then, 
with a lunge, grabbed the leader by 
the throat. “I’m just going to 
squeeze, and squeeze,” he gritted, 
“and what happens to you is your 
business.” 

Harvey leaped forward and 
JOSEPH SHALLIT 




grabbed Brace’s arms. “Let go, 
Red!” he yelled. “Let go!” 

Brace jammed him aside with a 
jerk of his big shoulders. Harvey 
leaped at him again. “For God’s 
sake, Red, this isn’t the one — ^it’s 
not his fault!” He yanked at Brace’s 
arms. It was like yanking an oak. 
Harvey stepped back, his mouth 
grim, and slammed his fist into 
Brace’s jaw. 

Red Brace staggered. The cara- 
van leader slipped from his hands 
and oozed down on the ground, 
gasping weakly. Red Brace’s fists 
tightened and he turned on Harvey. 
“Goddam you, you want to get 
yourself killed?” 

They stood there, glowering at 
each other, breathing hard. “The 
guy is only one of Baker’s slaves,” 
Harvey said. “Why were you taking 
it out on him?” 

The caravan leader was on his 
feet now. “That’s what I was try- 
ing to tell him,” he said weakly. 
“I’m only carrying out orders. I’ve 
got to work my place and work for 
Baker, too, to make up my credits. 
You know how long I’d last if I 
didn’t carry out orders.” 

“Okay, okay,” Harvey said, sud- 
denly sick of the whole thing. 
“We’ve got our oxygen, we’ve got 
our lecture. Now take off.” 

The settlers watched Baker’s men 
move to their wagons, like a troop 
of horses, and slowly set out up the 
road. 

“All right,” Red Brace growled 
abruptly, “I’m sorry. But you didn’t 
have any call to take a poke at me.” 

“You were about to kill the guy,” 
Harvey snapped. 

“All right, all right, I said I’m 

WRONG ANALOGY 



sorry. It was the wrong guy. Now 
let’s go after the right one.” 

In the center of the settlement, 
at the side of the road, was a yel- 
low wooden booth, marked COM, 
for communications. A loudspeaker 
on the roof brought messages from 
the central office. Inside the booth 
was a microphone and other elec- 
tronic apparatus. Dr. Lurie sat 
down before the microphone and 
pressed the Call button. He cleared 
his throat. “I — ^we want to talk to 
Colonel Baker personally,” he said. 



I N A large circular room, with a 
huge curving window overlook- 
ing the golden valley, sat Colonel 
Martin E. Baker, sipping a Scotch 
highball. It was a weak highball; 
Colonel Baker really didn’t enjoy 
drinking. But his doctor had told 
him, on the periodic physical he 
had taken during his last visit to 
Earth, that a mild drink before din- 
ner might help overcome his dys- 
pepsia. “Tenseness,” the doctor had 
said. “You’ve got to relax more.” 
This seemed preposterous to Colo- 
nel Baker, who always thought 
himself to be a very relaxed person, 
but there was no denying the dys- 
pepsia — it was there all the time — 
and he was willing to try anything 
that might ameliorate it. 

When the gentle buzzer sounded 
and the red light glowed on the 
communications set, Colonel Baker 
went over to it, flipped the switch 
and leaned back in his reclining 
chair. 

“Yes?” said Baker pleasantly. He 
was rather tickled with the arrange- 
ment that permitted him to watch 

95 




the faces of people who were un- 
aware of the television camera 
focused on them. 

“Sir/* said Dr. Lurie in a strained 
voice, “there has been — there is — a 
good deal of dissatisfaction in our 
group. This system of credits 
doesn’t seem equitable. Some of us 
find it extremely difficult to amass 
a hundred credits a day, and yet 
that is the amount we are charged 
for our daily tube of oxygen. Now, 
sir, we believe it would be fair if 
you reduced the charge for the 
oxygen, to, shall we say, eighty 
credits?” 

Baker took another sip of his 
highball. “Impossible,” he said. 
“I’m sorry, but it’s impossible.” 

He watched Dr. Lurie’s face go 
through some nervous gyrations. 
“Why, sir?” 

“The economy of this entire set- 
tlement was carefully worked out 
with the counsel of economists,” 
Colonel Baker said. “You realize 
that we just can’t step in and 
change one part without upsetting 
the entire pattern. We can’t tinker 
— it’s too hazardous.” 

“But, sir, we find that we’re just 
working for our respiratory needs, 
so to speak. That, plus the little 
food we consume ourselves from 
what we harvest. Oxygen and food 
— ^isn’t there any possibility of our 
earning anything more? 

“There have been settlers who 
have amassed enough credits to im- 
port some things from Earth. It’s 
all a matter of the rate of work. In- 
cidentally, I’ve noticed your pro- 
duction figures. Dr. Lurie. I 
wouldn’t keep on this way, if I 
were you. Deficits pile up. The sit- 

96 



uation can become dangerous faster 
than you imagine.” 

Even over the televiewer. Baker 
could see Dr. Lurie’s face pale. A 
hand suddenly appeared, pushing 
Dr. Lurie aside. The big face of the 
redhead, Brace, appeared on the 
screen. 

“Listen, Baker,” he roared, “if 
we don’t get a better deal, we’ll 
strike. You won’t get a damn thing 
out of us. And what the hell’re you 
going to do about that?” 

Baker sipped his Scotch and 
smiled. “You’re all free agents,” he 
said gently. “Far be it for me to at- 
tempt to dictate your behavior. 
You’re at liberty to do as you 
please.” 

Dr. Lurie’s voice came over in a 
tense whisper. “He’ll cut off our 
oxygen!” 

“He wouldn’t dare,” Brace 
snarled. “Nobody goes and kills a 
couple of hundred people.” 

Baker chuckled loud enough for 
the settlers to hear. “If that is all, 
gentlemen, good day,” he said, and 
flicked a switch. But it was only a 
one-way switch, shutting off sound 
from his direction but permitting 
him to see and hear the settlers. 
Their talk didn’t go on very long 
before Baker could see that Brace 
had lost — the thought of not seeing 
the oxygen wagons come along in 
the evening was too frightening. 

“All right, you jerks,” Red Brace 
shouted, “I’ll go after him myself.” 
He strode off up the road. Harvey 
Flanders ran after him. Baker could 
see, but not hear, the heated col- 
loquy as the two men walked on, 
and then, finally. Brace turned 
around and came back, and the 

JOSEPH SHALLIT 




two men disappeared inside Flan- 
ders’ house. 

Baker flicked a switch. Carsing’s 
face appeared on the screen, with 
a brisk, “Yes, sir?” 

“Might be some trouble the next 
couple of days — perhaps even to- 
night,” Baker said. “Double-check 
the infrared warning system, will 
you?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Baker went back to his highball, 
feeling rather pleasant. 

Late that night, in Harvey Flan- 
ders’ house, a long discussion went 
on among Harvey, Brace, Dr. 
Lurie, and the Schweitzer twins. 

“I went over it in detail with 
some of the old-timers here,” 
Harvey said. “I also did some per- 
sonal scouting, and everything they 
said seems to be true. Here’s the 
setup: 

“Our idea of raiding the com- 
missary for a lot of oxygen tanks is 
out. They don’t keep any stock; 
there’s never more than a single 
day’s supply for the settlement. Of 
course, we can’t make off with that, 
unless we want to kill off every- 
body else. 

“The oxygen plant itself is right 
up there on the hill, next to Baker’s 
house. That’s the key to his control, 
and he keeps it right under his 
thumb. Nobody — I mean nobody — 
except Carsing ever goes up there. 
They’ve got an endless belt system 
for taking up the empty tanks and 
sending back the full ones to the 
commissary.” 

“That makes the whole thing 
simple,” Red Brace said impatient- 
ly. “We go up there, knock off 

WRONG ANALOGY 



Baker and Carsing, and take over 
the oxygen factory.” 

“It’s not that simple,” Harvey 
said. “I imagine the old boy has a 
way of keeping strangers out. The 
story I get is that he’s got some sort 
of electronic telescope, and he sits 
up there all day watching every- 
thing that’s going on. You’re not 
going to sneak up on him, exactly.” 
Brace stood up. “The longer we 
sit and talk, the more time he has 
to get set for us. Anybody coming 
with me?” He looked around. 
“Frankly, I don’t give a damn if 
anybody comes or not. You’d only 
be in the way, anyway.” 

He headed for the doorway. 
“Red, you can’t go off half- 
cocked like this,” Harvey pleaded. 

“So long,” said Brace and went 
out into the cloudy night. 

Harvey looked around desperate- 
ly. “We’ve got to stop him.” 

“I say let him go,” said Dr. Lurie. 
“He might find out something of 
value.” 

“Get himself killed, more likely.” 
Harvey went to the doorway. 
“Red!” he shouted. He got no an- 
swer. The road was empty as far as 
he could see in the clotted dark- 
ness. 

He raced around to the rear of 
the house and stood still. Faintly 
he heard the crunch and crackle of 
steps in the grain field. Red was 
hitting across country. Harvey 
raced into the field. “Red!” he 
shouted. 

Harvey found him by the sounds. 
Brace was coldly angry. “Either you 
pipe down and come along, or you 
go on back. Nobody’s stopping me. 
If you try any monkey business. I’ll 

97 




kill you, and I’m not kidding.” 

Harvey fell in alongside him. 
“You’re the craziest jerk I ever 
saw.” 

“Pipe down before you give us 
away,” Brace growled. 

The hill loomed ahead of them 
like a giant blot against the sky. 
On their left were the thick woods 
where the settlers gathered timber 
for fencing and bridging. Straight 
ahead was a deep stream, tra- 
versed by a single bridge. 

“That bridge is a likely place for 
a burglar alarm,” Harvey said. 
“We’d better swim.” 

They took off their clothes and 
left them on the bank. They let 
themselves carefully down into the 
water and set out, using the breast 
stroke to keep the oxygen apparatus 
out of the water. They clambered 
up on the other side, chilled and 
shivering, and continued, naked, 
toward the hill. 

The ground roughened under- 
foot; the rise began. There was no 
apparent road. Here and there 
stood small blighted trees, devoid 
of foliage, standing like posts — 
They weren’t trees at all! Harvey 
gripped Brace’s arm. “Keep away 
from those posts,” he whispered. 

They continued upward slowly. 
Harvey heard a faint click. He 
stopped. “Hear that?” he whis- 
pered, “that click?” 

Brace shook his head. They stood 
still, listening. There was no other 
sound. Brace took a step forward, 
and stopped. “I heard it,” he whis- 
pered. They sank to the ground, 
and stretched out on their bellies, 
and waited tensely. 

Not a sound came out of the 



surrounding darkness. 

Far ahead, high in the sky, the 
windows of Baker’s castle dimly 
glowed with a yellow light. There 
was still a long way to go. 

Brace sat up and jerked a hand 
impatiently at Harvey. They got to 
their feet and moved forward. 
They were moving through trees 
now. Harvey followed Brace re- 
luctantly. There was something 
funny. Some sound he was hearing 
— or wasn’t hearing — 

“Red!” It was the oxygen pack. 
The soft, bubbling murmur it al- 
ways made was gone. “My oxygen 
is off! Yours, too! We’ve got to get 
back — ^fast!” 

Brace’s eyes flared white in the 
darkness. “Gome on,” Harvey 
shouted, and rushed back through 
the trees. Brace came lumbering 
after him, protesting loudly. They 
raced across an open space — there 
were the posts again — ^they passed 
them — 

Click! 

And now Harvey knew where 
the click came from. It came from 
inside his oxygen pack. 

Almost instantly, he felt the soft 
flow of the oxygen through the 
tubes. He sat down. Brace sat down 
heavily beside him. “Those posts,” 
Harvey said. “He must have them 
all around the hill. They throw out 
a radio wave that shuts these things 
off when you go past them.” He 
shook his head ruefully. “I should 
have guessed it. When I first took 
a look inside this oxygen pack, I 
noticed something that looked like 
a transistor, but I couldn’t imagine 
what that could have to do with 
oxygen.” 



98 



JOSEPH SHALLIT 




Brace let out a long breath. “We 
should have kept going,” he said 
bitterly. 

“There was a good two hours of 
climbing ahead of us. We’d have 
been dead a long time before we 
got there.” 

“Okay,” Brace said. “Let’s go 
wreck these radio posts.” 

“I’m afraid he has that all fig- 
ured out,” Harvey said sadly. “You 
notice the posts shut you off when 
you’re going one way, and turn you 
on again when you’re going back. 
If you go over there and wreck 
them, there’ll be nothing to turn 
you on again.” 

Red cursed long and loud. 
“There must be some way to beat 
this oxygen racket.” 

“We’ll think of something,” 
Harvey said determinedly. 

But the echo of his confident 
words rapidly faded as they moved 
through the grain fields. He was 
tired and chilled. Think of some- 
thing? That white-haired devil in 
that eagle’s nest had been thinking 
of the same subject for a decade. 
Could there be any angles he had 
overlooked? 

Long after Ruth was asleep that 
night, Harvey lay in bed thinking. 
He reviewed, item by item, every- 
thing he could remember about 
electricity, radiation, the laws of 
gases, atmospheric constituents, the 
mechanics of partial pressures — all 
the tag-end memories of his college 
science courses. He felt that if there 
was a solution, it had to be some- 
thing elementary, something that 
matched the simplicity of Baker’s 
own idea. 



The thoughts went around and 
around in his brain, an intricate 
and dizzying dance, forming a pat- 
tern that grew fuzzier and fuzzier 
and fuzzier ... 

He sat up with a start. His brain 
was tingling with something . 
something that seemed to be • . 

He struggled into his clothes, and 
dashed out of the house. He ran up 
the dark road and burst into Dr. 
Lurie’s house. “Doc, Doc, wake 
up!” he yelled. “I need some scien- 
tific advice!” 

Shortly after sunrise, when most 
of the settlers were heading for the 
fields, Harvey and Dr. Lurie went 
to the COM booth. “Better let me 
do the talking,” Harvey said. 

“I’d prefer it that way,” Dr. 
Lurie said. 



B aker, sitting before the 

electronic telescope, was enjoy- 
ing the sight of the great phalanx 
of settlers swarming into the fields, 
when the buzzer sounded on his 
communication set. In a moment, 
two faces appeared — Dr. Lurie and 
Harvey Flanders. They weren’t 
wearing their oxygen packs. 

“Good morning, gentlemen,” 
Baker said affably. 

“Hiya,” said Harvey Flanders. 
“Well!” said Baker. “I’m cer- 
tainly glad to see you in such good 
spirits after last night’s expedition.” 
“Thanks,” Harvey said. “All we 
want to tell you is that you don’t 
have to send us any oxygen any 
more.” 

Baker chuckled. “I see. You are 
going on strike, eh?” 

“No,” Harvey said, “we’re going 

99 



WRONG ANALOGY 




to keep working — but for ourselves, 
not for you, Colonel. You see. Dr. 
Lurie here has put his scientific 
brain to work and come up with a 
substitute for your oxygen pack.” 
“How incredible,” Baker said 
pleasantly. “And what is the sub- 
stitute, if I may ask? Alcohol?” 
“No, it’s still oxygen, Colonel, but 
not the way your pack handles it. 
You see. Dr. Lurie has figured out 
a way to use atomic, not molecular, 
oxygen — O instead of O 2 , if you 
follow me — and to give it by injec- 
tion in a highly concentrated form. 
As you see, we’re not wearing 
oxygen packs any more.” 

“So I noticed. But I’m afraid 
your little hoax can’t go on very 
long. In another two minutes, my 
friends, you’ll be gasping like fish 
and running frantically home to get 
those pesky oxygen packs.” 

“Why don’t you time us?” 

Baker sipped his coffee. “I am 
timing you, my friends. There are 
certain principles of physiology that 
can’t be contravened. We’re at the 
oxygen equivalent of a 27,000-foot 
elevation. The average duration of 
useful consciousness is two and a 
half minutes.” 

Baker sipped his coffee, watching 
the faces of the two men. The clock 
on his desk moved past two min- 
utes. Two and a half minutes. 
Baker shrugged. He knew there 
were some exceptions. Some per- 
sons in superior physiological con- 
dition had proved in aeronautical 
tests on Earth to be able to go on 
for as long as four minutes in as 
rarefied oxygen as existed here. But 
no more than four minutes. 

The clock hand reached four 

100 



minutes. The men still sat there. 

He had timed them wrong. He 
had missed a minute. Certainly. 
They were going to start sagging 
now. Now. 

Another minute went by. An- 
other minute. The men sat there, 
looking straight at him through the 
tele-screen. There was a cynical 
smile on their faces, as if they knew 
the camera was on them — as if 
they could actually see him. 

Another minute passed. 

Another minute. 

Baker leaped to his feet. ‘‘Die, 
damn you!” he screamed. 

The two men burst into laughter 
that exploded all over the screen. 
With a curse. Baker switched off 
the set and stood there, breathing 
hard. A moment later, he flicked it 
on again. The two men were leav- 
ing the booth. “Come back,” he 
yelled. 

They turned, part way. Their in- 
difference was maddening. 

“Come up here,” Baker com- 
manded. “I want to see your inven- 
tion. I want to buy it.” 

“Not interested.” 

“Damn you, you must!” Baker 
shouted, his heart beating furious- 
ly. His hypnotized eyes kept swing- 
ing back to the clock. At least 
eleven minutes had passed! 

“We’re not walking into any 
trap. Colonel,” Harvey Flanders 
said. “If you want to do any dick- 
ering, you’ll have to come see us. 
You know where to get us if you 
want us.” 

The two men started up the 
road. Baker watched them with 
sick eyes as they went with firm 
steps to Harvey Flanders’ house, 

JOSEPH SHALLIT 




and disappeared inside the door- 
way. 

Inside Harvey Flanders’ door- 
way, Dr. Lurie staggered. Harvey 
caught him, but didn’t have the 
strength to hold him, and both 
sagged to the floor. “Quick, Ruth,” 
Harvey said, gasping. 

She was waiting with the oxygen 
packs. Red Brace was with her. 
They fitted the masks quickly over 
the faces of the two men on the 
floor, and anxiously watched their 
rapid, intense breathing. 

In a little while, Harvey and Dr. 
Lurie were breathing at a normal 
rate. They got up and sat at the 
table, where Ruth had breakfast 
ready. 

“Do you think he’ll come?” Dr. 
Lurie said. 

“He has to,” Harvey said. “He 
can’t afford to let anybody spread 
a new gospel among his people.” 

“Would you guys mind explain- 
ing what this is all about?” growled 
Red Brace. 

Harvey laughed. “Sure, Red. It’s 
nothing complicated ; not very, any- 
way. Baker keeps plugging away at 
the fact that this is the same as liv- 
ing at a 27,000-foot altitude. It 
struck me suddenly that if that were 
really the case, some of us would be 
suffering from nose bleeds and other 
symptoms you get when you go up 
to a thin atmosphere, where the 
outside pressure is less than the 
body’s blood pressure. But nothing 
like that has happened. So obvi- 
ously, the atmospheric pressure 
must be about normal — the same 
pressure we have on Earth. There’s 
less oxygen, but there’s more carbon 

WRONG ANALOGY 



dioxide and there must be more of 
other gases, like nitrogen, to make 
up the full amount of pressure. 

“So you see where Baker figured 
wrong. He figured that if the 
amount of oxygen here is the 
equivalent of what exists at 27,000 
feet, on Earth, then the survival 
time here ought to be the same as 
at 27,000 feet. But the analogy is 
wrong. At 27,000 feet above Earth, 
the atmospheric pressure is so light 
that whatever oxygen is in your 
blood bubbles out pretty fast. But 
here, where we have normal pres- 
sure, the atmosphere is pushing in 
on us a lot harder and keeps the 
oxygen in the blood longer. You 
follow me? 

“Anyway, I put all this to Doc 
Lurie last night and he said I must 
be right. So he got out some of his 
books and did some figuring, and 
what he came up with was this: If 
we rested — didn’t move — while we 
breathed from our packs, getting 
our blood a hundred percent satu- 
rated, then we could take off the 
packs and go as long as fourteen or 
fifteen minutes before we keeled 
over. Long enough to convince that 
old buzzard that we’ve invented a 
new gimmick for giving oxygen by 
injection. He’s up there in his pal- 
ace now tearing out his hair — or 
more probably hotfooting this way.” 

Red Brace leaned against the 
doorpost and grunted contentedly. 
“Boy, when I get my mitts on him.” 

“Red,” Harvey said, “this time 
you can get as rough as you like. I 
don’t care what happens to him. 
You keep a lookout at the window. 
Soon as Baker gets close, everybody 
take off your oxygen mask and 

101 




stow it out of sight. We don’t want 
him getting suspicious about the 
Lurie invention. Another thing: 
We’ll need something for him to 
see when he walks in the door — a 
box that looks as if it contains some 
sort of instruments.” 

“I’ve got some boxes,” Ruth said, 
going back into the bedroom. 

“Okay. Now, Doc, you’ll do the 
talking, and Red and I will do the 
grabbing. But look casual as hell 
when he walks in.” 

Ruth placed a covered box on 
the table. “Impressive,” Harvey 
said. “Now, everybody, sit down 
and relax. It might be a long wait.” 
“Not so long,” said Red Brace a 
little while later. “They’re coming 
over the crest right now.” 

“Who’s with him?” 

“Looks like Carsing.” 

“I might have guessed that.” 
Harvey watched a while at the win- 
dow, then turned back. “Okay, 
everybody, masks out of sight.” 

There was a pause; a sound on 
the outside step. Then into the 
doorway walked Carsing. His hand 
made a swift motion inside his coat 
and out again. 

The squat, ugly barrel of an ex- 
plosive scatter-gun glinted at them. 

“Everybody back against the 
wall,” Carsing said. “Colonel Baker 
doesn’t want to be crowded.” 
Slowly, tensely, staring at each 
other, they moved to the wall op- 
posite the doorway. Baker walked 
in. His eyes made a quick circuit of 
the room, stopped briefly at the 
box, then turned to them. 

“What’s the gun for?” Harvey 
said bitterly. 

102 



Baker smiled. “You didn’t trust 
me, hence I didn’t trust you. Mis- 
trust begets mistrust. Now, gentle- 
men,” he said briskly, “explain this 
invention you told me about.” 
“Before we do any explaining, we 
want you to know what we want.” 
“Go right ahead.” Baker pulled a 
chair to the doorway and sat down. 
“Name your price.” 

“We’ll take the gun.” 

Baker’s eyebrows rose. “Impossi- 
ble. This is the only weapon on the 
planet.” 

“That’s all right with us. Hand it 
over and we’ll tell you all about our 
invention.” 

“I’m sorry, this weapon must re- 
main in our hands. We’re responsi- 
ble for maintaining order and sta- 
bility — ^it wouldn’t make sense for 
anyone else to have custody of it 
Now let’s get on with the business. 
This box, I presume — ” 

“Not a word until we get the 
gun,” Harvey said. 

Baker’s eyes narrowed. “Young 
man, you’d better hold your 
tongue. Dr. Lurie, I’m talking to 
you. I want the facts — ^immediate- 
ly. And I must tell you, you’re in 
no position to negotiate. Now speak 
up.” 

“I, sir — I — ” Dr. Lurie’s voice 
broke — ^he began again — “I’ll do 
what Mr. Flanders says — ” 

“We’ll see about that,” Baker 
said grimly. He stood up. “You’re 
coming with me. Carsing, take the 
box.” 

Carsing, holding the gun out 
warily in front of him, moved to 
the table. 

“Don’t you dare open it!” Ruth 
cried out. 



JOSEPH SHALLIT 




Garsing stared at her. Then, 
holding the gun against his armpit 
with one hand, a finger on the trig- 
ger, he reached with his free hand 
and unhooked the lid — 

Something sprang out of the box 
at his face — 

“Watch out. Carsing!” Baker 
shouted — but Harvey was already 
halfway across the room. He dove 
across the table, one hand aimed at 
Carsing’s chest, the other slamming 
against the moving weapon, knock- 
ing it upward, backward — 

Shot spattered through and 
around the doorway. 

Baker had leaped aside as he saw 
the muzzle swinging in his direc- 
tion. Now he made a quick move 
toward Harvey and Carsing, tan- 
gled and struggling on the floor — 
but a blow from Brace’s fist caught 
him on the cheekbone and sent him 
crashing back against the wall. 

Brace darted down at the strug- 
gling men. He stood up a moment 
later, holding the gun. Garsing 
struggled upward, out of Harvey’s 
grasp and reached for the gun. 
Brace’s foot shot out and crashed 
with ferocious impact against his 
jaw. Carsing’s head slammed back- 
ward against the floor. His body 
arched a moment, and then went 
limp all over. 

Harvey sat up, breathing hard. 
Ruth already had her oxygen pack 
on and quickly adjusted his. 

“Get mine,” Red Brace said. He 
was standing in the middle of the 
floor, the gun trained on Baker, 
who stood half-slumped against the 
wall, watching them dazedly. 

There was a hissing in the air, 
A soft, persistent hissing. 

WRONG ANALOGY 



“Somebody has a leak!” Dr. 
Lurie shouted. Harvey, Ruth, Brace 
frantically felt their oxygen packs 
— and then their hands stopped, 
and they stared at Baker. 

A jagged hole, caused by a small 
bit of shot, was visible on the side 
of his oxygen pack. 

“Give the orders, Flanders,” 
Brace said. “Do I blast him?” 

“Won’t be necessary, Red,” 
Harvey said quietly. 

Baker looked from one to the 
other with puzzled eyes. Then he 
muttered, “I must be going,” and 
swung away from the wall, and out 
the door. 

He stopped. He felt his pack. 
He came rushing back, his eyes 
wide with terror. “A leak!” he 
shrilled. “I need another pack!” 

“Sorry, we’ve only one apiece,” 
Harvey said. “You know that.” 

Baker’s lips trembled. His face 
was white. “Your invention! Your 
invention! I’ll make any deal you 
want. Hurry!” 

“There’s no invention,” Harvey 
said gently. “Don’t you know that 
by now?” 

Suddenly Baker leaped forward, 
his hands flying. He had the* oxygen 
mask half off Harvey’s face before 
Harvey could untwist his hands 
and wrench free. 

Baker stood there, breathing 
hard. Abruptly he turned and 
rushed out to the road. “Some- 
body!” he yelled. “Somebody give 
me a pack! I’ll pay anything!” 

Homesteaders peered at him in 
amazement from their doorways — 
then shut their doors as he rushed 
at them. 

“I’ll pay anything!” Baker 

103 




screamed at the pitilessly closed 
doors, 

“This is what he was leading up 
to for ten years/’ said Brace. 

Harvey looked at the purple box. 
“A jack-in-the-box/’ he said softly. 
“Ruth where in the world did this 
thing ever come from?” 

“I brought it with me/’ Ruth 
said defiantly. “I thought maybe it 
might be hard to get toys here — 
and maybe we might want toys 
someday . for somebody.” 
Carsing stirred and groaned. 
“That’s a relief — we’re going to 
need the man to show us how to 



run the oxygen works,” Harvey 
said. “Okay, kids, let’s go to work. 
There’s a lot to be done.” 

“Going to try to get a ship for 
the trip back home?” asked Brace. 

“I don’t know,” said Harvey. 
“Maybe we can make a go of it 
after all,” he went on dreamily, “we 
might be able to pump oxygen into 
the houses so you don’t have to 
wear a mask when you’re home re- 
laxing ... or making love.” He 
put an arm around Ruth’s shoul- 
ders. “Who knows? — maybe one 
of these days we might find use for 
those toys you brought.” • • •

THE SATELLITE VEHICLE 

( Continued from page 15 ) 

the elaborateness of the study pro- 
gram and the degree of importance 
the scientists attach to any particu- 
lar area. 

The ground stations themselves 
can be largely automatic in opera- 
tion. They can consist of a radio 
receiver and recording device 
which can be turned on by the 
signal from the Satellite. After the 
signal has faded out, a time delay 
device can turn off the station re- 
ceiver. 

Certain of the stations should be 
manned, however. These should 
contain scientific personnel 
equipped with powerful telescopes, 
theodolites and radio transmitters 
to be used for monitoring the flight 
of the Satellite and making any cor- 
rections in its attitude or its orbit 
that may be necessary. For this 
purpose a computer could be used 
to calculate the actual orbit and 
compute the correction required to 
regain the desired orbital position. 
The orbit will require correction to 
compensate for loss in altitude due 
to the residual atmosphere even at 
three hundred miles altitude. These 



stations need not be in remote 
areas, since the Satellite will pass 
over any area of the Earth every 
24 hours. 

The purpose of this article has 
been to propose an orbital satel- 
lite which would provide a maxi- 
mum amount of data on the phe- 
nomena connected with the Earth 
and the upper atmosphere sur- 
rounding it. The information 
gained from such a satellite would 
also remove many of the obstacles 
in the path of man’s next great 
conquest — outer space. Satellites 
of the future will undoubtedly be 
larger and more elaborate, leading 
up to the final goal, the manned 
space platform. From it we will be 
able to keep watch on our weather, 
look out for potential infractors of 
peace and, finally, use it as a spring 
board for the long dive into the 
vast ocean of space, with destina- 
tion, who knows? 

(We wish to express thanks to 
Dr, R. S, Richardson^ of Mount 
Wilson and Palomar Observatories, 
for information and help on the 
subject of possible orbits for this 
satellite vehicle,) • • • 



The goals that science seeks are not merely more food, more 
products, more gadgets. The goal in the last analysis is a moral 
goal — ^more happiness for human beings, expressed in whatever 
terms their own philosophy dictates. — L.A, Du Bridge

A MATTER OF ORDER 



BY FOX B. HOLDEN 



44T DON’T like it at all,” the tall thin man said. 

X His name was Tharn, and he was known 
throughout the sprawling colony for the high- 
strung nervousness that was understandable enough 
in a youth of fifty, but hardly normal for a man of 
his years. You had to be careful how you talked to 
Tharn, even if you were Angelo, Dean of Masters, 
himself. “I don’t like it,” Tharn reiterated, with 
another dramatic sweep of his long bony arm, “one 
bit, Angelo. Look at them, circling up there.” 

The thin, lined face turned squarely to Angelo’s 
own, and the large, almost protruding black eyes 
snapped with all the vibrant fire of the fine artistic 
mind that boiled constantly behind them. 



106 




Angelo turned his own eyes 
upward, momentarily following 
Tham’s still-upthrust arm. Al- 
though he did not need to look 
again. It was as the Second-Eldest 
of the colony said, of course. The 
slender, stylus-shaped object that 
reflected the golden midday sun- 
light in splintering shards against 
the almost cloudless cobalt of the 
sky still circled. 

It would land at the edge of the 
great colony. Angelo knew this, 
Tham knew it, the colony knew it. 

Angelo turned his old eyes back 
upon Tharn, and the ghost of a 
smile plucked at his white-bearded 
lips. Tham colored, suddenly aware 
of the incongruous picture he pre- 
sented. Poised with all the drama of 
a Mark Antony pleading to the 
populace to sorrow for a Caesar, 
while rather mundanely bedecked 
in his paint-spattered working- 
smock! The high color in his 
seamed face remained, but he pur- 
sued his point as though Angelo 
had never smiled at all. “They 
won’t be satisfied — ” 

Angelo got up from the canvas 
stool before his easel, and the mo- 
tion itself was enough to halt Tham 
in mid-sentence. There was going 
to be some sort of action, anyway. 

“Now look,” Angelo said slowly. 
His voice carried the measured de- 
liberation that its rich, deep timbre 
complemented so harmoniously. 
“First of all, Tharn, if we begin 
showing signs of undue alarm, you 
know what it will do to our younger 
men and women. They’ll be upset 
for weeks, and we’ll have another 
one of those terrible Realist pe- 
riods.” Angelo grimaced with his 

108 



incredibly bushy eyebrows. “Be- 
sides that, if you’d take a really 
careful look at that ship, you’d see 
in a moment that it’s certainly of a 
type none of us have ever seen. We 
certainly cannot prevent its land- 
ing. We certainly do not have the 
means to present a hostile front 
when it does. Therefore, we shall 
go to the Dell and greet it. I would 
estimate — ” Angelo turned his mas- 
sive, white head slowly for another 
glance above the low, alabaster 
walls of the mosaic-tiled court-yard, 
“that they will effect a landing 
within another ten minutes or so. 
If you’ll send an apprentice to go 
fetch Maler, the Philosopher, and 
Ghezi, the Semanticist, and — and I 
think Ojar, the Orator, with word 
to meet us by the Lesser Amphi- 
theater there, we can be on our 
way directly. Oh — and Tharn — ” 

Tham followed the First-Elder’s 
glance to his paint-smeared smock, 
colored once more, and immediate- 
ly erupted into a volcano of action, 
as though rounding up a young 
jack-a-napes apprentice and locat- 
ing and donning a suitable street 
toga were things that could be 
simultaneously accomplished. 

He exited, mumbling heatedly 
between cries of “Boy! Boy.'” and 
Angelo smiled again, and prepared 
his own person for the meeting. He 
mused that Maler, the Philosopher, 
commented often in his evening 
wine that to run was never to es- 
cape, only to change the pattern of 
pursuit, and of course you couldn’t 
argue much with Maler. Not and 
win, — but then, nobody on Ste. 
Catherine very often argued to win. 
Where was the pleasure in that?” 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




T here was a great, scorched 
spot in the soft greenness of the 
gently-rolling earth, and it widened 
like an undammed, muddy pool 
as the thundering, cylinder of steel 
lowered itself on a pillar of flame. 

They kept a respectable distance; 
Angelo, Tharn, Maler, Ghezi, Ojar, 
and the several hundred curious 
and apprehensive of the colony who 
had followed. Angelo had decided 
the closest possible spot for waiting, 
stopped there, and then made no 
move save to shield his eyes from 
the terrible glare of the ship’s land- 
ing-jets as it made its cautious de- 
scent. As he had predicted, the 
chosen landing-spot was at the ex- 
treme northern edge of the Dell, 
near the Lesser Amphitheater. And 
they had all just arrived in time. 

The ship settled; its thunder 
ceased. 

Masters, Students, and appren- 
tices alike unshielded their eyes, 
and then all were turned in un- 
broken silence toward Angelo him- 
self. He was Dean. He could deal 
with this. 

Angelo hesitated for perhaps a 
full minute. In that time he or- 
dered the scene in his mind; the 
ship from Space, thrust upward to- 
ward the heavens like some weapon 
of challenge, surrounded by the 
gentle undulations of the low Re- 
noir range to the far west ; the rug- 
ged, ice-capped Alps of Cezanne to 
the south and further distant still; 
the low, wind-tossed and wild Van 
Gogh Plain that stretched endless- 
ly to the east, and finally to the 
north, the fertile richness of the 
VEilleys of Rembrandt which 
reached as far as the eye could see. 

A MATTER OF ORDER 



All this, and the warmth of the 
clear atmosphere that embraced it 
all was seen and felt in that minute 
— by Angelo, and by the rest, as he 
intended they should, Thisy the 
minute seemed to say, is yours. Do 
not betray it. 

And then he was walking with 
the dignified deliberation of his of- 
fice toward the ship, the pure white 
of his full toga billowing gently in 
the soft breezes of the Dell. 

There was a clanging sound. A 
round section of the ship, near the 
wide fins of its stern, swung open; 
men came through it, started down 
a series of metal rungs to the 
ground. As he walked, Angelo 
counted them— one; two; three. 
Three men. 

Three men from Earth, of 
course. 

And he knew what they wanted. 

They met halfway; three men 
from Earth in their blue-and-silver 
uniforms, their heads close-shaven, 
their boots polished as though fash- 
ioned of metal . and Angelo, 
inches shorter than they, far greater 
in girth than they, with his feet in 
hide sandals, and his long white 
hair falling free to merge with the 
rolling folds of his single garment. 

The man in the middle of the 
uniformed trio spoke; the obvious 
leader. 

“This is the^ — the Colony of 
Artists, Planet of Ste. Catherine?” 
The heavy sound of his voice 
seemed to balk at the words ever 
so slightly. “You are their leader?” 

“I am Angelo, Dean of Masters 
here,” Angelo replied. “I do not 
lead, but guide, instead. I am at 
your service, gentlemen of Earth.” 

109 




“You seem certain of where we 
are from/* 

“But of course — do I not imme- 
diately recognize and speak your 
tongue?” 

“You would, of course,” the 
leader said, and Angelo did not 
miss the hint of grudging acknowl- 
edgement in his voice as he said it. 
In face he was little different than 
the other two, although perhaps a 
year or two older. But for all prac- 
tical purposes they were the same — 
the high foreheads, the too-closely- 
spaced blue eyes, the sharp, disci- 
plined features, the lack of any 
genuine character at all. They were 
as much of the same bolt of cloth 
as the imiforms they wore. 

“Of course,” Angelo smiled. 
“Our memories here on Ste. Cath- 
erine are fortunately long, and our 
libraries are well-filled — and well- 
used! And of course we have been 
expecting you.” 

^^Expecting us?” 

“Naturally,” and again Angelo 
smiled. “It is a philosophical truth 
after all — Man is a social creature 
by nature, and as such, must con- 
tinually seek the company of his 
own kind. And of course,” and 
there was the hint of a repressed 
glitter in the old man’s eyes, “the 
people of Earth have always known, 
and have — have never forgotten 
where we of Ste. Catherine were to 
be found.” 

The leader reddened and seemed 
on the point of explosive speech, 
and the muscles of his jaw hard- 
ened as he controlled his impulse. 
Angelo waited. 

“You are of course — correct,” he 
said after a moment’s pause. “And 

no 



it will perhaps be best for all that 
we understand each other clearly 
from the beginning. We come to 
you in some embarrassment, we 
come to you asking a favor.” The 
last word the leader uttered with a 
distaste that the best of his self- 
discipline could not control, and 
Angelo chuckled inwardly. A favor, 
was it? Embarrassed, were they? 
He could quite imagine! 

“Perhaps,” Angelo said, “it 
would be more comfortable to dis- 
cuss your mission in my studio. Will 
you gentlemen follow me, please?” 

He turned and began walking 
back to where the others waited, 
and the three men from Earth fol- 
lowed him. At first they balked for 
the briefest moment, but they fol- 
lowed him. 



T he studio of Angelo, Dean 
of Masters, was open to the 
sky like his court-yard, for this was 
the fair season on Ste. Catherine in 
this latitude, and not yet time to 
draw the transparent tarpaulin sky- 
light across the tops of the studio 
walls. Angelo had seated himself 
near the center of the superbly- 
muraled room, on one of the low, 
colorful cushions so widely pre- 
ferred in the colony to the more 
formal furniture that was still to be 
found, to some extent, in the shops 
and homes of the artisans. Artists in 
their own way, of course — and 
some practical work had to be put 
up with to satisfy the more mun- 
dane requirements of existence. As 
long as they took true pride in the 
beauty of their work, the artisans 
would always be very welcome 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




members of the colony — as well, to 
be sure, as necessary. 

And seated in a semi-circle be- 
hind Angelo were the other Elders, 
and two or three advanced Stu- 
dents to cater to whatever needs 
might arise during the conference. 
There would be no apprentices 
here! Before Angelo, taking to their 
cushions rather awkwardly (his 
beard, fortunately, was of sufficient 
luxuriance to cloak the tiny smile 
of satisfaction at his lips!) were the 
three Earthmen; their leader, of 
course, in the center and facing 
Angelo directly. 

“We may begin at any time,” 
Angelo said in his most courtly 
fashion. Those behind him nodded 
— Tharn for once a little absently, 
because he had become involved in 
a rather difficult line-sketch on the 
tablet supplied him for note-taking. 
He didn’t approve of these stran- 
gers, but there were more impor- 
tant things than interstellar visitors, 
especially since they were only 
Earthmen, and Angelo was insist- 
ing on taking full charge. He, 
Tham, was through arguing. Walk- 
ing multiplication- tables! Pah! An- 
gelo could have them, then! 

“It is possible you are not aware, 
here on Ste. Catherine,” the leader 
began with the slightest tinge of 
sarcasm, “that on Earth there is, 
at present, a rather regrettable dif- 
ference of thinking on policy.” 

“Another political slaughter, that 
is,” Angelo countered not too light- 
ly for the obvious allusion to Ste. 
Catherine’s complete lack of any 
kind of electrical or electronic com- 
munications. “A major war, in 
other words.” 



The leader flushed slightly. 
“Well, yes. As a matter of fact, it 
has gotten somewhat out of con- 
trol.” His teeth were almost 
clenched as he made the admission, 
and Angelo easily sensed the pain 
in the man at having to make it to 
the Artists of Ste. Catherine, of all 
people in the universe. “Out of con- 
trol,” the leader was continuing, 
“to the point where, in fact, and 
according to the unimpeachable 
findings of our actuarial computers, 
human life on Earth is threatened 
with complete extinction.” The 
leader hesitated, interpreted the 
looks in the eyes of the men whom 
he faced, and found himself not 
quite able to meet them with his 
own. But he continued; best to get 
it said once and for all. 

“We are now, of course, well 
aware that predictions which were 
once thought the mere rantings of 
alarmists — religious and philosophi- 
cal cranks — were tragically accu- 
rate. Both sides are perfectly 
matched from the technological 
aspect, of course. The so-called 
‘secrets’ of science cannot be kept 
‘secret’ at all, at least not by men. 
They exist everywhere in the uni- 
verse, for any man to seek and to 
exploit as he sees fit.” He paused, 
at last found the timerity to meet 
the gazes of the others. 

“Go on,” Angelo said. 

“Both sides have come to abso- 
lute stalemate. But not, regrettably, 
the kind of stalemate that means 
cessation of activity. In a conflict 
to the death, stalemate simply 
means battle without victory; bat- 
tle until neither side has a living 
man left to fight. 



A MATTER OF ORDER 



111 




“So, in short, we are desperate. 
There must be a victor, or Earth is 
lost entirely. One more mass strato- 
attack with L-bombs and . Well, 
at any rate — there must, as you can 
readily understand, be a victor, and 
soon. Obviously, the Others must 
be defeated.” 

Yes of course, thought Maler, the 
Philosopher. It is the Others, al- 
ways, who must he defeated . 

“And so we have,” the leader 
was saying, “come to you for help.” 

He stopped speaking then, for a 
moment, waiting for Angelo’s re- 
ply. Waiting simply for him to ask 
“what kind of help could we Artists 
possibly give you . .” — waiting for, 
and prepared to take unflinchingly, 
the searing taunt that could not 
help but be in the question . 
“ — you who can fly ships through 
Space, who have at your computer- 
tips the hard-won miracles of sci- 
ence and engineering?” But word- 
lessly, the leader waited. 

And in the brief moment before 
he spoke, the history of it all flashed 
through Angelo’s mind; the history 
that began with the Revolt, Three 
centuries ago, with the Ancestors of 
them all on Ste. Catherine. The 
artists, the philosophers, the writers, 
the orators, the dramatists, the 
poets — all of them, who had, when 
at last they could no longer stom- 
ach their civilization’s arrested 
adolescence and its refusal to be 
weaned from its electronic and 
atomic toys, remembered the first 
Fundamental Law of Order in art, 
and put it to devastating use. 
Unity. 

In Unity, they rebelled. 

They warned, first, in fairness. 

112 



They took pains to point out care- 
fully that it is a healthy sign for the 
developing child to become in- 
trigued with movement, sound, and 
color — that it was normal for a 
child to spend hours observing, ex- 
amining, operating, even building 
a new mechanical toy. But when 
his new books gathered dust and 
fell into disuse — when he could 
quote all of Faraday and none of 
Swinburne — when this happened, 
his development as a human being 
of full depth and breadth was at an 
end. 

When he became hypnotized by 
his toys — 

When motion and force became 
an obsession — 

When the means became an end 
in itself ; when the tool became the 
raison-d^etre, rather than the struc- 
ture it had been fashioned only to 
help build, then the point of civliza- 
tion had been hopelessly lost, and 
thinking men had but one alterna- 
tive: leave, and start over. 

And so, banded together, they 
had left. 

It had not been so difficult. For 
to the Ancestors, a tool was always 
that and nothing more. They could 
not build spaceships, but they could 
buy them, and so they had. 

They could not navigate Space 
nor pilot their craft, so they hired 
the technicians and engineers who 
could. 

And when the Ancestors had ar- 
rived at a planet of their choice 
(the scientists had been duly proud 
of their superior accomplishment 
in being able to find just such a 
planet — and of course were paid 
more than the engineers and tech- 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




nicians) the Ancestors gave tliem 
all sizable bonuses and sent them 
packing back to Earth where there 
were so many fine Things to spend 
their money on. 

The Ancestors had, of course, 
been called dreamers, ivory- tower- 
ists, alarmists, fools. They had been 
called madmen who lived in the 
unenlightened past, believers in 
some foolishness called artistic in- 
tegrity; schizoids who were afraid 
to face Reality. Posh, polish, and 
good riddance muttered the sane 
ones over their charts and oscillo- 
scopes as the last of the Ancestors’ 
ships blasted free of Earth. Mut- 
tered, of course, because there was, 
somehow, a vague awareness that 
the Culture-Vultures hadn’t left in 
fear of the bright, quick Machines, 
but in — well, they said, in disgust! 

Good riddance to childish rub- 
bish. 

But now, apparently, the men of 
Earth had gotten themselves into 
something so peculiarly impossible 
that they were desperate enough to 
face the cutting wit of the fat-bot- 
tomed Artists on Ste. Catherine, 
who wouldn’t be able to say “I told 
you so” in a straightforward, mat- 
ter-of-fact way and let it go at that. 
Oh, no. But it would be better to 
have their damned articulate 
tongues tear you apart than an 
S-field. 

The moment of reflection was 
spent, and Angelo asked the ques- 
tion. 

“And how can we help you?” 
was all he said. 

The leader took a deep breath. 

“One moment,” Angelo said as 

A MATTER OF ORDER 



he was about to speak. “Just a word 
of warning if you please. If you 
want anything of us at all, simply 
state your case in plain language. 
Don’t try to ‘sell’ us anything — ^we 
can beat you roundly at that! And 
if we agree to your request, you will 
accept exactly what we give you; 
beggars, no matter how expert in 
some things, are still not in the 
position of choosers! A matter, 
after all, of — shall we say, artistic 
integrity?” 

The leader’s eyes flashed: Damn 
you and your infernal artistic in^ 
tegrity! but it was his mouth which, 
fortunately for him under the cir- 
cumstances, did the talking. 

“Very well. As I said, both Sides 
are in perfect technological and 
therefore military balance — 

“Balance is so important,” inter- 
rupted Angelo. Behind him, Ojar, 
the Orator was having a difficult 
time repressing a yelp of pure 
mirth. It was unfair, of course, to 
bait these stumble-witted fellows 
like this, but it was amusing — espe- 
cially when Angelo did it, who, 
though a Painter, was well up on 
his word-play. “. Perhaps you 
have already noticed,” Angelo was 
going on, quite oblivious to the 
perspiration on the leader’s high 
forehead, and exactly as Ojar had 
expected, “how well we of Ste. 
Catherine observe the Fundamental 
Laws of Order. The Rhythm of our 
very way of life, for example — but 
excuse me! You were outlining your 
request . .” 

The leader had reddened help- 
lessly, and his subordinates had 
both stolen quick glances at him. It 
was as though images of the man 

113 




himself, reflected from mirrors at 
either side, had suddenly taken on a 
volition of movement of their own. 
But quite quickly they became well- 
behaved images again. 

“Both sides have equally effec- 
tive weapons and defenses,” the 
leader went on, “and so it has be- 
come a disastrous war of attrition. 
To win, we must have something 
they do not have, obviously.” 

“To bring your Side into Domi- 
nance, of course,” said Angelo sage- 
ly. “To prevent your Subordina- 
tion, as it were . .” Ojar had a 
sudden, violent fit of coughing. 

“Yes,” the leader said. There was 
a momentary blankness in his eyes, 
and Angelo decided that enough 
was enough. Unfairness was unfair- 
ness, after all. They must hear the 
man out. 

“We have looked back over his- 
tory,” the leader said. “It was an 
unprecedented step, to be sure, but 
we were desperate! At any rate, we 
discovered that one time, it was 
possible to make an enemy believe 
he was wrong, and that you, his 
enemy, were right, through a rather 
obscure verbal art called, I believe 
it was, propaganda?” 

“Yes,” said Angelo. “The prov- 
ince in Art of writers and orators. 
As a painter or sculptor will create 
illusion with paints or stone, just so 
did the writer create illusion with 
letters.” 

“So we came to understand,” the 
leader said, trying a little note of 
sarcasm of his own. “Our present 
difficulty is this: we of course have 
no such peop — er. Artists — at our 
disposal. We of course tried our 
own hand at it but nobody ever 

114 



seemed quite able to agree on just 
what it was we were trying to talk 
about, so — well — We have come to 
you. Will you do this for us? A few 
words, for the sake of humanity?” 

Clever, thought Maler, at that. 
An intended appeal to the philo- 
sophical side of the artistic mind. 
Maybe the poor wretch really 
meant it, even if he wasn’t aware 
that “humanity” meant both Sides. 

“To answer you,” Angelo was 
replying, “I’ll of course have to 
summon our Master of Letters. It 
may not be easy to win his assent, 
I warn you. He can trace his own 
ancestry all the way back to news- 
paper reporters, advertising copy- 
writers and trade- journal writers — 
and so has naturally inherited their 
bitterness toward all such prostitu- 
tions of the Art of Writing, and 
artistic integrity in general. And 
you will admit that hacking out 
propaganda to order is of course 
just that, to say nothing of the 
moral aspects involved! How- 
ever — 

Magnanimously, Angelo lifted 
his right arm and beckoned, and a 
Student was at once at his side. 

“Fetch Master Forsyth at once. 
And tell him I said to leave his 
new Quarto behind; this is urgent.” 

The young woman left, and they 
waited. 

“A cigarette?’ Angelo proffered 
the leader. 

There was surprise on the man’s 
face. “You mean you can make — 

“Just crude paper and tobacco 
grown in the soil,” Angelo said 
apologetically. “Untouched by any 
rays but the sun’s, I’m afraid, and 
our few medicine-men — ^we have 



FOX B. HOLDEN 




all kinds of hobbies here of course 
—just won’t comment. Here . 
and a light . 

The leader had almost finished 
his cigarette when the Master of 
Letters arrived. 

‘‘Angelo, you churl, sir! Do you 
know how long I’ve been working 
on that line? You know how diffi- 
cult it is for me to get a decent 
trochee when I’m — oh, company? 
Capital! ‘Come fill the Cup, and in 
the Fire of Spring — ’ ” 

“Please, Forsyth. These men are 
here on business. They want you to 
do them a favor.” 

Resignedly, Forsyth kept quiet. 
And listened for good measure. 

He listened for ten minutes. And 
then the leader was finished and 
Forsyth said “A pox on’t!” 

“Please, Forsyth — 

“He’s right!** came Tham’s 
voice. “I told you I didn’t like it, 
and I don*t, and — ” 

doesn’t like it?” bellowed 
Forsyth. “Then by Heaven, I’ll do 
it! Teach you, sire, to make char- 
coal caricatures of me on a day 
when I’m not lampooning you! 
Very well, but I don’t think I’ve got 
too many apprentices that aren’t 
engaged right at the moment. 
Nonetheless, if — ** 

The leader was beyond control. 
"^Apprentices, did you say?” he 
croaked hoarsely. “Why, you — ** 
“What in Dante did you think, 
man-child?” shot back Forsyth. 
“You don’t suppose I’d give you 
finished, creative writers for the job 
of a trained ape, do you? Some aj> 
prentices I’ve got, and some ap- 
prentices you’ll get — and only be- 
cause Dean Angelo here says so.” 

A MATTER OF ORDER 



T he three men from 

Earth strode with military pre- 
cision back toward their ship. The 
leader was in the center, and his 
subordinates, each with bulging 
briefcases in both hands, were on 
either side. A large group from the 
colony walked at a slower pace be- 
hind. Angelo, as usual, was at their 
head, and flanking him were Tham 
and Forsyth. 

“Another whole week wasted!” 
lamented Forsyth. “Not that the 
time means anything, but those sen- 
sitive young boys and girls of mine 
will never be the same! One of 
them, just this morning, told me she 
was thinking of taking up politics 
as a hobby! The tortures I go 
through for you, Angelo — 

“I still don’t like it!” Tham cut 
him oflF. “And I don’t like them! 
And, Forsyth, I saw what you had 
your precious little apprentices do- 
ing! You had them writing exactly 
the same tripe they wrote for that 
other crowd that landed two weeks 
ago!” 

“Tham, you certainly aren’t the 
only one who has no use for that 
barbaric breed. So — as long as they 
remain equally matched, they’ll 
eventually, uh — ** 

""But that means — ** 

“A Fundamental Law of Order, 
of course, my dear Tham. Balance, 
as I think I may already have 
pointed out . .” 

Forsyth quoted something from 
on obscure source about the im- 
portance of artistic integrity, and 
then they watched together as the 
ship from Earth blasted homeward.

Rip Van Winkles may be real in 
50 years if the success that has been 
achieved in restoring frozen ham- 
sters can be transferred to humans. 
Tests at the Medical Research Cen- 
ter in London have proved that the 
hamsters can be put to sleep, 
packed in ice for a few hours, then 
gently thawed without damage to 
the brain or other internal organs. 
By treating certain organs with 
glycerine before freezing, scientists 
hope animals can be stored in a 
completely frozen state indefinitely. 
If so, they would be alive and no 
older when thawed out. The re- 
searchers also believe that airmen 
and seamen, who have been in ac- 
cidents in frozen areas, should not 
be given up for dead, that resuscita- 
tion such as is used on the hamsters 
should be attempted. 

A skin "garden" in which living 
human skin will be grown is being 
set up at Duke University. If sue* 
cessful it is expected to provide the 
means for saving thousands of lives 
now lost each year as a result of 
burns. A bit of the burned victim’s 
own skin would be set to growing 
in the garden. In two weeks such a 
piece of growing skin may be mul- 



tiplied to ten times its original size, 
as experiments have shown, and 
would be an excellent size for graft- 
ing. Since a skin graft from a donor 
lasts only ten to thirty days and the 
victim’s own skin is necessary for a 
permanent graft, the skin garden 
would be an excellent source. The 
Duke project is believed to be the 
world’s first attempt to reproduce 
the patient’s whole skin, consisting 
of both outer layer and true skin 
for grafting. 

Cattle of the future may get an en- 
tire bale of hay in the form of a 
shovel full of pellets. Research ex- 
periments have shown that most 
feeds can be pelleted by subjecting 
them to certain tremendous pres- 
sures. A machine has been devel- 
oped which can produce the 4,000 
to 6,000 pound per square inch 
which is necessary. For the future 
farmer who owns such a “pelleting” 
machine it will reduce labor, the 
need for maintaining a quality feed 
and it will cut the cost of storage 
space, feed handling equipment 
and transportation. 

Scientists have predicted that seven 
more heavy elements, 102 through 
108, will be created in the next 15 
years. The most likely production 
method will be an atom smasher 
such as the heavy ion linear reactor 
which will speed up very heavy 
nuclei, like neon. By hurling rela- 
tively large nuclei into the hearts of 
heavy atoms like uranium it should 
be possible to build up the heavier 
elements. Predictions also state that 
elements 102 through 105 should 
be stable enough to identify chem- 



117 




ically. Those from 106 through 108 
probably will decay so rapidly that 
they can be analyzed only from 
their radioactivity* 

Buying and selling of stocks may 
some day really become the “sure 
thing” that investors dream of. Re- 
searchers have found that an elec- 
tronic computer, when properly 
directed, can make the calculations 
necessary to indicate future trends 
on the market. The program is still 
so new that its success or failure is 
yet to be determined, but the ex- 
perimenters are convinced that the 
correct formula can be found. They 
know that the chartists who plot 
the daily curves on opening and 
closing quotations have noted that 
a daily geometric pattern forms 
which seems to indicate future 
trends. If this pattern can be prop- 
erly calculated by the computer, 
short range fluctuations should def- 
initely be predictable. 

The armed services may in the 
future employ totally deaf in- 
dividuals to work at jet air fields. 
Science knows that to the human 
ear noise above 140 decibles is in- 
tolerable, and modem jets already 
create sound levels around 130 de- 
cibles. Others in production will 
produce 160 to 170 decibles, or 
noise levels greater than humans 
can stand. In such an instance the 
man who is totally deaf has an ad- 



vantage that is incalculable, and 
may well be the only individual 
who can bear the brunt of such 
noise levels. 

Safe and successful bone trans- 
plants using radiation-sterilized 
bones will soon be normal hospital 
procedure. The bones which can be 
taken from dead bodies, are cut 
into various sizes and shapes with 
a heavy duty band saw, then they 
are freeze-dried and sealed in glass 
tubes imder vacuum. To sterilize 
them, the glass tubes are placed 
within a concrete cave containing 
cobalt rods. At the end of a 20 hour 
period, the bone is removed and 
stored at room temperature. The 
treatment kills any bacteria and 
viruses that may have been in the 
bones, but there is no residual 
radioactivity and the character of 
the bone and its capacity for fur- 
ther growth are not changed. 

Parents may soon be able to know 
in advance whether the nursery 
ought to be pink for a girl or blue 
for a boy. A discovery by Canadian 
scientists has made it possible to 
determine the sex of an unborn in- 
fant about one month before it is 
born. From the amniotic fluid 
which surrounds the baby in the 
womb, doctors are able to deter- 
mine whether the cell component 
known as chromatin, found only in 
female cells, is present.

Dear Editor: 

J. C. Hickman in ‘‘Hue and 
of April brings up the subject of in- 
terstellar civilizations and asks what 
others think about the subject. I 
cannot entertain the notion that we 
might be the first and most highly 
civilized race, as the editor states in 
his footnote to Mr. Hickman’s let- 
ter. That idea would seem to be the 
height of conceit on man’s part. I 
believe there may be people on our 
moon now, and so on and on in 
space there is life after life in some 
form. We may be very surprised at 
what we find “out there” when we 
begin to travel the stars. 

As I read between the lines of 
science fiction it seems to me the 
authors are aware of much that 
isn’t published in the newspapers. 
And the truth we may someday 
find, may be much stranger than 



the fiction we read now. 

— H. Conrad 
Port Orchard, Wash. 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I think it’s a damn shame that a 
mag such as “If” should be run- 
ning on a bimonthly schedule. The 
material you print is on a level with 
the best and far above that printed 
in some of the monthlies. 

In the April issue, I can say that 
I enjoyed every story. Jones’ 
“Human Error” was written in the 
same style with which he appears 
in the “top” mags. It was a good 
story and well thought out. The 
drawing that accompanied was 
quite mediocre though. “Chrome 
Pastures” was another excellent 
job, except that I thought the 
epilogue was tacked on and should 
have been worked out in the story 
itself. 

Having met Harlan Ellison at a 
recent meeting of the Eastern 
Science Fiction Association, I en- 
joyed his story all the more. He’s an 
up and coming talent and it’s good 
to see him rise from the mass of 
fandom. 

— ^Allan Cheuse 
Perth Amboy, N. J. 

Did you see Ellison^ s ^'The Crack- 
pots'' in the June issue? 

Dear Editor: 

Aren’t there any kind aliens? It 
seems to me that stories always de- 
pict them as so far above us that we 
are beneath contempt or that they 
are so monstrous they want to kill 
us all off and take over Earth for 
themselves. The general idea in 



119 




S.F. seems to be to prepare man for 
what may be an inevitable meeting 
with such creatures; and to tell 
man that he’s not ready for it; but 
when the aliens are constantly 
painted in such evil lights how will 
man ever be ready? How can you 
expect an alien to be acceptable 
unless some form of writing is used 
that will convince Mankind that 
those we might meet are not the 
monsters drawn in S-F? 

— ^K. J. Ashton 
Gardner, Me. 

A good point and well taken. 
also one to which we wish we knew 
the answer. Anybody got any ideas? 

Gentlemen : 

I’m a reader of “If’ because my 
son is a subscriber. I agree with W. 
C. Cantrell of Bryan, Texas, about 
the sexy covers. The April cover is

an example of what I mean. I also 
disapprove of the story illustrated 
by the cover. Such wanton and 
barbarous killing cannot be excused 
in a representation of our future 
world. The other stories are on a 
much higher level. I especially en- 
joyed “Human Error” and 
“Chrome Pastures”. 

— J. Schofield 
Chesterhill, Ohio 

Sirs: 

Why so much speculation on 
what “other” worlds are like in 
science fiction magazines? Seems to 
me we should do a little more 
worrying about the mess we have 
right here and straighten out a few 
thousand things before we start 
spreading ourselves too thin over 
the galaxy. About the only advan- 
tage I can see to finding another 
world that’s liveable is that it would 
enable some of us to get away from 
this badly mismanaged one. 

On second thought what’s to 
prevent men from making that one 
just as bad. Seems to me Mankind 
is just dreaming about Utopias and 
is at least intelligent enough to real- 
ize he’s messed up his own world so 
badly that Utopia is impossible 
here. But how many realize that 
just because the place is fresh and 
new and perfect it doesn’t neces- 
sarily follow that it will stay that 
way once man gets his hands on it.
